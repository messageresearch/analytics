you we we were blessed to see a young couple brother Wesley sister Khloe get married and now we sent them on their way and they'll be coming back to us by God's grace but um we are thankful for his grace on our lives God's good to us amen so we want to keep in mind as we read this morning what our theme is from zachariah's prophecy of who art thou oh great Mountain Thou shalt become a plane and The Headstone shall be brought forth with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it so verse one of chapter 4 and after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first verse voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit and Behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne and he that was to look upon was like um a Jasper and a sarden stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in the sight like an emerald and then chap 5 verse1 and I saw in the right hand of this one sitting on the throne a book written Within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look their own and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the lon of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof notice this word prevailed means actually to wrestle with and overcome so he fought a battle in order to open the book to take the book and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and of the V Beast and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by that blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and is made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth in other words we shall bring Heaven's Dominion on the earth God bless you you can be seated I'm going to be speaking to you today on the adopted son's legal rights and Authority now John in this vision sees God on the throne and in his right hand is a book that is sealed with Seven Seals and we Ponder you know what is this book and why was God holding this now the book was the titled to the the Earth and the Earth of course is promised to the meek those that will humble themselves to the word of God and will give Christ lordship and for they shall the meek shall inherit the earth the Bible says so the Earth is promised to every True Believer as our inheritance and when God made the Earth he made it for man God ruled the heavens and he made um the Earth for man and gave him dominion and he was to subdue the Earth and to take dominion over it and bring literally bring Heaven down on the earth now this is God's great plan for the Earth because even with with when it's all over with God will have cleansed the Earth through his process of water baptism the days of Noah shedding his blood upon it in the days of Jesus Christ and then the Great Fire of God will come and cleanse the Earth completely and eradicate all Sin from it and heaven will literally be here upon the Earth so you see the book is the title that is showing man's ownership to the Earth it was the right to Heaven's life it was the right to immortality to Divine love and and peace as brother Brandon when he went beyond the curtain of time he spoke of its atmosphere and he said it was nothing but just pure perfect love and he said and and and so you see that's Heaven's atmosphere the love of God because that's God's basic nature God is love it's the essence of God and in that book uh that we're talking about are names and they are names of those who God fornew who are his sons like Adam was his son and these are God's heirs so all of God's HS are written in the book they are in the Lamb's Book of Life now there is of course another portion to it which is The Book of Life where all life is sacred and written in a book but when we when we come to the Lamb's Book of Life as it was Old and New Testament that portion of the Lamb's Book it is those who are his offspring those who are his children that are written in there and of course we do not become his children when we when we kneel at an altar we were his before the world began we only found out who we were at the altar where God revealed himself to us as father and you as son now of course as we look back in in there this book is a title showing man's ownership to the Earth it was the right to Heaven's life to to to Divine love to peace and in that book are names the names of every son or daughter of God that will come into existence and of course he has to intercede until every name that is written in that book is manifested on the earth and that name is dipped in blood so he can't call an end to things until every Son of God has come and is manifested on the earth I'm glad for that cuz had he done it 2,000 years ago you and I wouldn't be in the picture but because there were more names in the book The Saints have been waiting there for us to come and now we are here believing we are some of the last ones that whose names were in the book to be manifested on the earth now Adam was to have Immortal Life he had a place within the soul to be sealed by the Holy Spirit he was God's son upon the Earth and everything was given into his hand he named the animals and whatever he called them that was the name thereof he controlled the atmospheres of the heavens and as I said brought Heaven down to the Earth yet he was a free moral agent in order for there to be a choice there were two trees that were set before him one was the Tree of Life which would in time become revealed in the person of Jesus Christ amen who would be the the food or the bread from Heaven that if a man ate thereof he would never die and the other was the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil which was personified in that ancient serpent called the devil and Satan now God made Adam a wife and she was bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh and he gave them dominion over the Earth and together they dressed the garden and everything was Heavenly because as I said they brought down Heaven's atmosphere to the Earth but there was there was potential danger in the garden although harmless unless yielded to and they were safe as long as they held Dominion over it and as long as they stayed behind God's word they were protected from all evil all sin all sorrow all pain all death but you see there was a serpent also who was right next to man he could reason he could talk and Satan came in the serpent to Eve and began to anoint his lips and his mind to speak reasonings accusing God of withholding Knowledge from them and not letting them rise to full potential you know saying you know God knows if you take of this you'll be like God and so you see that he as the Bible said that old serpent from the beginning he is there the Satan beguiling and yes polluted Eve by his message that which brought unbelief and doubt and an accusation that Eve received against God that God was withholding something from her that that would keep her from rising up and of course you know Satan wants to rise he wants to exalt himself above God and so his Spirit now comes anoints the serpent who ass serps Authority and he begins to take authority ministering talking to uh dealing with another man's mate and here in this as he asserts Authority then he gets Eve now to exalt herself and and and go beyond what God Said and disobey God's word now the Bible is clear that it was the woman who was deceived it was not Adam that was deceived you see Adam he was he was the word he was uh the word made flesh he was a Son of God and he was not deceived he knew exactly what what had taken place and and the Bible tells you in 1 Timothy 2:14 that Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression and so seeing his wife in this Fallen condition knowing she would be banned from Heaven banned from Eden banned from the economy of God yet she was a part of him amen she he could not deny her she was bone of his bone she was flesh of his flesh amen and here Adam looks now and he hears Satan's holding something hostage that that is valuable to him that is his life his of his flesh is him and here she's deceived and here she's pulled out and here she is going to be cast out of Eden and you know what he says he makes a choice I'll go with you oh yeah right I'll become of this sin with you and we will face the wrath of God together so he actually takes on her sin now Adam traded his life of Heaven to go with his wife and Satan took position took his position as Prince of the power of the air that's right of atmospheres and the channel by which Heaven flowed to Earth became blocked by this new Prince right because this satanic Prince don't want God's blessings in Eden that's right he doesn't want God's righteousness he does want God's love and peace so you know he he wants to block off Heaven from the earth now of course he will do it of course to man he will first start with man man will will be the first to fall if you get the king of the earth to fall then everything beneath him the whole Kingdom Falls with him that's right so you see in Redemption it ain't it ain't Earth we want to see restored first it ain't animals that gets restored first it's man that has to be restored first and if you get man back in his rightful position then all the Earth will be subdued and brought back under God's kingdom again now so you see Satan then becomes the prince of the power of the air as brother Bram said in future home he said all the sin that's in the heavens above he is the prince of the power of the air he keeps off Wars off the blessings from God in there comes Thunderbolts and Lightnings and Strikes the Earth and everything from the heavens sheets of slicing rain and typhoons and storms and everything comes from above which Satan uh the prince of the power of the air so Satan took man's life and man lost his power his right to Dominion but Satan could not take the book of title that's right now he could Lord over Adam he could Lord over atmospheres by permission because Adam gave it to him he surrendered the kingdom to him and so he could Lord over that but he couldn't take the book that's right he could not take the book it belonged to man and Satan is not a man now but by man surrender to Satan by accepting his lordship Satan becomes a squatter upon the Earth he claims it because man sold it to him but it could not be sold forever right that's right amen remember God has a law and that is if a property owner was in debt and forced to sell his land in Israel it could be redeemed but until the Redeemer could come death was in his hand man was in slavery that's right slaves to sin its vices is evil right under its bondage but and and death was in his hands the Earth was under Satan's control every nation belongs to him and he governs and controls it all and it's under his Dominion right that's the state of the Earth today right because the Earth is still a fallen Place why is all of this because Adam forfeited the title deed that's right yet the Earth was not made for Satan if I just get that to you this morning if I can get you to even look at your Earth for a minute you realize your Earth Earth was not made for the devil lord it was not his for him to control possess to own that's right he is only there by permission whose permission Adam's permission come on when we were birthed in under Satan's domain coming the way of sexual birth into mortal life yet the Earth as I said was not Satan's God never gave it to him right so now we see the book of the title is returned to the hand of the original owner now of course the the title deed is in question man cannot take it because of sin he is unworthy amen Satan cannot take it because he cannot inherit the earth the promise has never been given to him so the book of title is held in escr until there can come a redeemer amen until there can come a man who is worthy not an angel not even a God right God had it certainly his hands were worthy right but the problem is is getting it back from the hands of God back to man again so you see you see the the the title had to return back to the hand of the original owner which is God God's the original owner and man had fored his rights over the Earth to Satan but he does not legally own it he becomes as I said a squatter by man's permission as as we read the scripture last weekend where he said Jesus to Jesus I I give all the kingdoms of this world to you if you worship me I'll give them all to you for their mind right for they were given to me right now so you see Adam gave it all right and he traded it yeah he traded eternal life he traded Heaven's life to go with his wife now with the title deed I lost to Adam as I said the title is now questioned Adam surrendered it to Satan Satan can't own it but he can possess it and because that Adam gave it to him but Satan don't want to give it up and for 6,000 years Satan has possessed it and he brings chaos among nature he brings death and destruction he brings chaos to mankind he brings sickness and sin and death and sorrow you see death and darkness and death is Satan's kingdom and he through which he brings Rebellion to the Earth and when he brought Rebellion to the earth now the animals that Adam once had control and had power over were now rebelled against him he could call the lion before for and they would come gentle and lay down by the lamb but no longer he cannot do it because no longer will they be subservient to him they have a new master he is now a slave and this man Adam is a slave and all nature Rebels against him the plats that he once controlled and said okay move over here no you you move out of this one's path this one needs more sunlight and he would dress the garden the the way by the word of God no longer could he do that now nature itself Rebels against him that ought to tell you a little bit about your own self this morning if you're born again your nature your flesh is always there to rebel against the spirit that's right it's always resisting oh I'm not going to praise God today I don't feel like it you know I I'm I coming to the church I you know I I just something you do no you see it Rebels against the word of God and it's always in constant Rebellion you cannot live by your flesh you cannot walk after your flesh you have to walk after the spirit right you walk by your flesh and you'll lead to corruption amen but all would have been lost except God would not give the title of the Earth to the devil he would not just let him have the Earth and Mankind no but in the process of time God becomes a man that's right I want you to get the picture on because I I want you to understand he could not do this as God he had to lay aside his godship right and become a man to win it back for are man right he had to become the man God could hand the book to all right so in the process of time God becomes a man God would not come or Jesus would not come W with in in the way of all the rest of mankind he would come virgin born he would come by the spoken word he would not come by the sexual birth he would not be born in sin and shapen iniquity that's right he would not come in the world speaking lies like we all do he would not come that way but he would come as a virgin born pure unadulterated holy clean undefiled Hallelujah so God became a man and so in his time he came a man without without sex yet by the womb of a woman and in his birth he would not be born in sin and shaped by iniquity I want you to see this Hebrews chapter 2 verse 14 Hebrews 2:14 for as much then as the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood he also himself likewise took part of the same so he says he had to leave Spirit form God form and take on Flesh and Blood he also himself likewise took of the same that through dying he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil let me tell you something God has one thing for the devil and that's his destruction that's his overthrow and his Ultimate Destruction that's now notice and deliver them look at this next verse and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the Seed of Abraham so this is what God did God became a man amen to Bear to to to live here upon the Earth to face the same Temptations we Face to go through the same trials of life that we go through to overcome the devil Amen in the flesh Amen to be tempted in all points like we are you say oh brother Tim I I I don't understand god well understand Jesus because God is a spirit but if you can see who Jesus is for a minute you can see he's a man like you are a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief amen you can see him as a man and his suffering and there's life upon the Earth right amen you can see him as someone you can approach not some holy God that's out there that you can't approach but another man a human like you are human that's right and so again the forfeited title deed now goes back in the hands of the original owner almighty God that titled the to the Earth and eternal life and when when Adam forfeited brother Brandon said then Satan's dirty hands could not take it so it went back to the original owner himself oh we're going to find it in just a minute there he sits on the throne with it in his hand the title deed oh it makes me feel religious amen the title deed to eternal life Abstract title deed to eternal life when Adam forfeited it for wisdom instead of faith it went back into the hands of the honor almighty God all right what's it doing waiting in the hands of God waiting for Redemption claims so he as the lamb symbolizing his work as a kinsman redeemer made a way for Redemption he made a way back and the Redeemer is to claim the book for man not for himself as God but for you and all men now as we hold this thought a minute now he cannot he cannot take it all back at Calvary and for ReStore man in the earth because there are more names on the book that must be manifested on the earth you see you see the the bride the bride of Christ are the names in the book so they are the book and so really to literally take the book is to take his people that's right to Rapture the church so that's the real meaning of the taking of the book yeah is to catch her up out of this Earth out of this world in a change condition in a glorified State into God's presence yes now so again you see the all the names though must be manifested on the earth and they will they will come like all the others through sexual birth and then will have to be born again of the spoken word now I know a lot of times we attribute that oh well that's how he writes children let me tell you that's every child of God Peter said it clearly he said being born again not of corruptible seed but of the word of God that liveth and abideth forever so every child of God is born of the spoken word and when you are born of the spoken word you are born like you should have been before the fall I I wish I wish that would sink in our hearts that we can really see ourselves in our in our condition of what Redemption has made us now Jesus is on his way to the cross and I want you to look at John 12 and verse 27 we're just going to examine some of these things John 12:27 now is my soul troubled and what shall I say father save me from this hour but from this cause came I to this hour yeah so here is here he's approaching now his his greatest battle now he's battle against demonic forces he's made at bindus leave leave leprosy leave even death itself had to obey him raised up Lazarus the Widow son at name yeah amen gyrus his daughter three three is a witness amen he knew the power over death he knew the power over sickness but now he says it's for this reason I I didn't just come to bring temporary healing that's but I come to I've come to deal with the devil amen that had bir you into the real birth and give you a new birth where you can be birthed have an entrance into the kingdom of God now I want you to see this as he's coming there he said what should I pray father save from this hour but for this cause this is really what I should pray this is the reason I came to this hour oh if you could just find your place in life right now that you're not just here just to dilly-dally on the earth you are here in the flesh right now to defeat the Devil that's right amen everywhere that he that he comes against you you are here as devil defeaters serpent bruisers Overcomers in this age that's right that's why you have been placed here and Jesus said I must meet this enemy Called Death right for for this reason is why I've come and then he says father make your name glorious glorify thy name and then there came a voice from Heaven saying I have both glorify it and I will glorify it again and the peoples therefore that stood by heard it and said that it thundered and others said an angel spake to him and Jesus answered and said this voice came not because of me but for your sakes now I want you to watch the statement now is the Judgment of this world and now shall the prince of this world be cast out and then he explains and I if I be lifted up from the earth Hallelujah I will draw all man to me this he said signifying the death he should die all right now so he says if I be lifted up if I span the way between Heaven and Earth that's right amen then I will draw all men through this way that I made I'll bring them back in Heavens life I'll make it where Heaven can come down into them I make it where the glories of God will be in men and women's life again and the Prince of Peace Will Rain within them so now now through this here's my victory if I be lifted up then now will come the Judgment of this world and now shall the prince of this world be cast out this is the beginning of my kingdom casting out Devils taking a moving the squatter off of what belongs to me now Jesus of course is speaking of the process that would begin at Calvary for he says now is the time for judgment on this world now the prince of this world will be driven out so here at the cross judgment would come upon the world and the prince of this world would be driven out and where would it begin I'm going to show you where it begins let's go to Romans 8 and verse3 because we want to see the beginning of the casting out of Satan the start amen the initial War to cast Satan out Romans 8:3 for what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh no man could overcome nobody could live righteous because of the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh now here's his purpose here's his plan let's go to 2 Corinthians 5:21 for he made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him so now here's what he did he made him to be sin now I want you to see the second Adam his wife who is to be bone of his bone whose names are in his book yes it is trapped in sin but he's going to do and do something that Adam couldn't do right and that is redeem us by taking on our sin now notice he would condemn sin on the flesh he knew no sin he did this made him sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him now Jesus would take upon himself the sins of the whole world that's the sins passed this is why Resurrection could take place the Saints the Old Testament Saints would rise the sins passed the sins present and the sins future now I want you to see this he would take on him the sins of the whole world even your sins as the sacrificial lamb he would take on your sin and in death destroy the works of the devil now of course he's doing things exactly opposite yeah of what Satan does Satan exalts Jesus humbles he would humble himself to the death on the cross he would humble himself to become sin he who knew no sin righteous undefiled would take on your sins right now so Satan who is known as a prince of the power of the air he called The Prince of Darkness he's called the God of this evil age he's called the father the source of lies he's called that murderer from the beginning he's called the accuser of the Brethren his name is Tormentor devil Satan Lucifer and it goes about like a roaring lion seeking those who he may devour now I want you to notice he is not a roaring line he's an impersonator amen he's not the king but he's impersonating so he's going around with his ferocious Roar as if he's a lion but does he have legal rights over us now it's true that his lies and his subtlety brought about death and thus he has the power of death and yes our bodies are made of the earth that was cursed and there therefore they grow thorns and thisel and they will die but does he have legal rights over us no because it was through lies and deceit that he wrestled the the control of the Earth from man and lorded it over him and he's such a bold accuser he will even stand between God and his sons as he did with job and accused man before God and even accused God in his face he's bold oh yeah he'll go about like a roaring lion he roars but now I want you to look away from him for a moment let's go back in our mind to Revelation 5 we see a call for a worthy man not an angel right not even a God but a man because it would require a Kinsman a man now I want you to see he could not do this is God right so he condescended laid aside his his uh his robes as God and took on the Robes of a man the great king of glory left his throne the one who sat on the throne I I want you to see this becomes the lamb the Kinsman he takes on the form of a man to take on human battles right to go through life as you go through it to fight your Wars with you and for you that's right amen and of course the call goes out for a man that is worthy and this call is answered symbolically by a lamb that had been slain right now I want you to get this start because because this is after after Calvary for the lamb had been slain that's on this side of the cross that he takes the book yes somebody help me preach now hold my hold your thought because I want you to understand friends there is something you may look around on earth oh ain't nothing going on I tell you God's not anywhere listen Heaven has been moved yes on our behalf as the lamb steps forward to take the book that's right what is he doing he is claiming it as a man for man to give it back to man Hallelujah and I'm telling you friends there's a redeemed people on the Earth right now that he's handed the book to because he did not do this for himself he was not lost he did this for [Applause] you and it doesn't do any good as long as God has it in his hand the titles got to come back in man's hand that's right Dominion has to come back in man's hand there's a call made for a man that was worthy and a search was made and no man was found worth Worthy is that right Elijah wasn't worthy Moses wasn't worthy you look way back over from Calvary 2,000 years ago and see great man Smith Wigglesworth wasn't worthy FF Bosworth wasn't worthy now William Brandon wasn't worthy I'm not worthy and you wasn't worthy no man was found worthy and because no man could be found worthy the one on the throne became a [Music] man now he stepped forward and condescends and pays the requirement of death with his own life and raised up triumphant over death hell and the grave right now yes he's a slam slain lamb and it appeared as though he went down and defeat you know people figured out how can a a man go down in death be a victory I want you to know he had to take flesh to death amen for when he died I want you to think it appeared as though he went down to defeat because when he died pain rabbish his body it rattled his senses like pain does he grooed in Agony every pain and torment of sickness he bore on the cross right you say I got a headache this morning he had a headache on the cross I have a back ache today he had a backache on the cross right excruciating pain amen you say well I I have a sickness and listen he had sickness death until he died want you to get it he growned in agony every pain and torment of sickness he bored on the cross that's and in his battle at Calvary by death to the flesh Jesus tripped Satan of his armor he took away from him every weapon I'm going to show it to you in the Bible First I'm going to show you that God that Jesus said Satan has an armor so let's go to Luke 11:2 but if I with the Finger of God cast out Devils no doubt the kingdom of God comes to you so he says I'm using just a finger of God to cast out devils and it's because the kingdom of God has come when God's Kingdom Come Satan gets cast out right amen but if I'm casting out demons because of power from from God it proves the kingdom of God has has arrived see when the strong man armed keepeth his Palace his goods are at peace but when a stronger than he shall come upon him and overcoming he taketh from him all his armor in which he wherein he trusteed and defile and and divideth his spoils so let me let me just paraphrase that for you for when Satan strong and fully armed guards his Palace it's safe until someone stronger and better armed attacks and overcomes him and strips him of his weapons and takes away from him all his belongings Hallelujah so when I cast out Satan by the Finger of God is because I am ex I am exhibiting lordship over Satan's kingdom the kingdom of God has come the Holy Ghost has come that is the kingdom of God somebody help me preach amen and when I cast out Devils the kingdom of God has come to you I'm exhibiting I am I am showing my lordship over sickness therefore blind eyes has to open deaf ears have to have to come open come on am my death is house has to give away because I come in as a king from another kingdom up greater than Satan with more power than Satan he's been safe all this time in his house with his armor he can do anything he wants to mankind but now he's got a reckoning day now somebody stronger than the devil has appeared on the scene and that's why I've been casting out Devils that's why I've been opening the eyes of the blind that's why I've been raised of the dead that's why I've been exhibiting my power but I tell you what I'm fixing to do I'm someone stronger and better armed and I'm attacking his kingdom and I'm going to strip him of his weapons and I'm going to carry off his belongings I'm going to render the devil powerless and I want to just tell you this is what Jesus did at Calvary punch your neighbor and wake up the sleeping virgins I'm fixing the treats now you see this is what Jesus did at Calvary Satan has no legal rights that's right he was stripped at Calvary yes he now look here Colossians chapter 2 verse 13 and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh the flesh not being cut off hath he made alive together with him having forgiven you all trespasses right so I put this very simply God Made You Alive together with Christ having freely forgiven us all our sins look at verse 14 blotting out the handwriting of ordinance that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross so in other words he cancelled the charge of our legal indead now listen listen we were we were in debt we were born that way come on but he canceled the record of charges against us that condemned us and he took it away by nailing it to his cross Hallelujah and haven't spoiled principalities and Powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it so now there are many ways the translators translate this listen to some of them when he disarmed the rulers and authorities those Supernatural forces of evil operating and fighting against us he made a public example of them exhibiting them as captives in his triumphant possession having Triumph over them through the cross so in his resurrection he triumphed over sickness all the agony of pain the wounds that's the sickness which he died ever cause of death amen he triumphed over every sickness Rose over death the triumphant Christ amen and by doing so he disarmed rulers and a ities and he disgraced them publicly and he triumphed over them in him I want you to know Jesus had complete and total victory over the devil Hallelujah even to the glorifying of his own body Hallelujah won't you be glad when you get total Victory to the glorifying of your own body amen there Jesus defeated all powers every sin every sickness every pain that had befallen Adam Adam's race all the way from the fall of Man and he let the whole world see them being led away as prisoners when he celebrated his victory amen let me read another disarming the rulers and Authority he had made a Public Disgrace of them triumphant over them by the cross I like this one he stripped all the spiritual tyrants in the universe of their sham and pretense Authority at the cross and March them naked through the streets hallelujah amen totally shaming the enemy totally stripping him of his power he stripped Satan of his armor he unclothed and stripped principalities the powers of their armor which by which they were clothed and disarming them like it's usually done to enemies when they fall at the hands of their conqueror took away all their powers and their authorities and the hosle princes and rulers he took off from him took off from himself and boldly displayed them as His Conquest but when he at by the cross triumphed over them having stripped the principalities and the powers he made us show them openly triumphing over them in it so let me tell you Satan was rendered powerless he was defeated completely when Jesus shook off sickness and therefore death therefore sickness when he sh off death there and his resurrection are you with me now there in that moment he defeated cancer he defeated every dreaded disease every crippled condition he defeated sin he defeated death itself he defeated everything everything there was nothing he did not defeat I'm telling you this morning all sin is defeated all sickness is defeated death itself was defeated at [Applause] Calvary now Satan is powerless he once held the power of death because even the greatest of prophets Patriarchs sages could not go in God's presence but were held as captives in a holding place where they're waited for their redeemer to come the Bible calls them captives he said he led captivity captivity the captives now notice furthermore Heaven had been blocked off from man man could not go into heaven and he could not bring Heaven down now when Adam was here on the earth he was a dual nature one he operated in the physical we see taste smell feeling here just like we do he he had a mind with senses reason affection conscience all of those things but he did not operate the Earth from that he controlled the Earth from Heaven's realm he he operated as a dual nature there he lived in heaven while he was on the earth and he operated from heaven right here on the earth and he brought Heaven down and he created a heaven on Earth we call it Eden amen but now when sin entered in heaven was blocked off from man man could not go into heaven and he could not bring Heaven down and the only way from Heaven to come down is for God to bring break through the clouds of Satan's Darkness because man himself could not go into God's presence amen who can Ascend into the into the hill of God he that has holy hands and a clean heart we didn't have it come on so you see as brother Bram taught us he said over the Earth since the Garden of Eden that man was commit that sin was committed all Heavens was shut off from mankind the domain of this Earth was Satan's it belonged to the devil Satan is the prince of the power of the air and no man could see in the glory no man could have True Fellowship with God because of the powers of Darkness Heaven means the atmospheres above and all these Powers shut off Heaven's atmosphere from mankind because of sin and stormy demon clouds of darkness and powers that accused wouldn't let God and man Fellowship it had been broke since the Garden of Eden because of sin but now through death through Jesus death to mortality by destroying death in his flesh by his resurrection to immortality and then his Ascension into heaven he broke every dark Veil or curtain but between God and man the clouds the darkness the Hideous Darkness through the the Jesus when he ascended remember he broke through the veil of sin he tore apart the with the high priest's blood of his own body and he tore apart the veil of sickness that was held over the people for he was wounded for our transgression and with his trps we were healed he went through the great veil of worry the great veil of fear he ran every Veil into two and he broke every Power and he scattered every devil Hallelujah now this is what he did now I want you to understand again he ascended as a man into heaven want you get the picture now where man could not go before now he ascends through all of these veils of darkness and he's piercing the clouds moving back to Darkness and he becomes the channel through which he makes a way for all sons of God to be able to approach God I'll hold that thought just for a minute let's go to Ephesians chapter 4 and verse 8 let's read this scripture wherefore he saith when he ascended on high he led captivity captive and he gave gifts unto men so he led those who were captive held back we call it Abraham's bosom amen it was a place of waiting for the Redeemer to come right and they were not in a glorified condition right right I mean when Samuel was seen there he was still an old man right right he was unchanged he was there in a holding place until amen as as as as job would say that I will sleep until my change comes and so the change would come here now where he would lead captivity captive and then he said when he ascended up he opened up channels he opened up channels or he gave gifts unto men right I want you to see this Gifts of his holy spirit through which he would Channel His blessings through amen oh now verse n now now he that ascended what is it but he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth now let's take a look at this now he ascended we got that as he does he lays captivity captive amen he gives gifts unto men send back gifts makes he makes a channel he makes ways for gifts to come back to men are you with me now that he that ascended what is it but he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth I want you to see this in your Redemption now this is shown in the Bible the Old Testament types just as Jesus was the sacrifice he was the lamb without blemish kept up and examined and so on would be the token and so on like that he was also shown in the type of the scapegoat right right amen now this is where the sins of Israel was put upon a helpless goat a an animal that had done no sin come on and all the sins of Israel would be taken by the high priest in a ceremony and they would take it and put it up the head of that goat now that's that's who we were we were just old goats flesh are you with me amen but remember a goat is also a clean sacrifice and so here here again he's represented here in the scapegoat and then the the animal would be LED out into the Wilderness and left all alone right and so was Jesus our scapegoat and all the sins of Israel and all the sins of the world was put on his head and he cries out my God my God can't you hear the blading of that that animal my God why H has Thou forsaken me and he was left alone the goat would be left alone in the wilderness he would be there by himself subject to all of the animals of prey and there now they would lead this goat out a priest would go out with this goat lead him out into the Wilderness and leave him there alone in by himself and the Goat now being left alone I just tell you goats are are are are flock animals they don't like to be left alone they they need a companion and he was left alone listen friends he went to hell alone that's right right there was no Mama went with him no Daddy went with him nobody went with him he went alone yeah and he was he was there all the sins of the world was put on him that's right amen and when he screams out my God my God why H has Thou forsaken me then here come now all the tormentors the Wolves the Lions the Predators they come and pray pounce on that goat they shred him to pieces they destroy him every way that he can they tear him they rip him listen friends you think of Agony at the cross but down in hell when he ascended down in hell every demon is laughing parading around screaming yelling obscenities poking at him pring him slapping him he's listen he's taking your punishment he's going there as a sinner so you don't have to I preaching to you Eve he's taking your punishment your abandonment when you should have been abandoned when you should have been Cast Away he goes alone taking your sins down into hell now then not only has every pain and Agony and death and everything and now in the clutches of that down in Hell haunting Spirits demons charity him afflicts HIM Tears him to pieces and he keeps descending and descending and to send him till he gets to the bottom of the bottomless pit to the lowest of Hell dying with your sins as a condemned sinner God condemned him he was in hell because of you that's right right not because of what he did that's right he knew no sin that's he had done none of this but now all the sins has been placed on him and there he there is there reaching down to the lowest regions of the dam I don't know that it has a bottom but however it gets it he gets to the lowest region of the dam and there there when when he reaches the lowest there in three days here he's come but there is another word hallelujah there is another word that is laying there that says I will not leave his soul in hell and neither will I let my Holy One see corruption Hallelujah and brother when the time of hell and that part and he comes down he surrenders through all all of the Demons of hell are pouncing upon him and something in a moment begin to change this torn bleeding lamp begin to change and as he changed he became triumphant and he goes right into the house of Hell itself and he snatches away the king from Satan to death Hell In The Grave hallelujah amen there he eats bits in the face of the devil gives him a big a click a slam there in his face and say listen today I am taking you captive and you are going to be stripped naked what you've done to me I'm going to do to you what you've done to man I'm going to do to you what You' done to my bride I'm going to do to you I'm going to put you in shame I'm going to strip you of your power you are going to be rendered harmless powerless I'm going to triumph over your cancer your sickness your diseases I don't care you name the name the name of Jesus is higher than all names that at the name of Jesus every knee has to Bow and every tongue has confess that he is ruler Lord of all amen something changed now he comes up to the region of the lost and he says can I read it to you the region of the dam goes and there he goes in 1 Peter chter 3: 18 will you read it with me 1 Peter 318 for Christ also ha once suffer for sins the just are the Righteous for the unrighteous that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but Made Alive by the Spirit by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison amen which were sometimes Disobedience when Once in the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark Was preparing where in few that is eight Souls were saved by water the light figure were un to even baptism do save us not putting away the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ right so this is exactly why we are baptized what do we do we are being baptized unto his death not in that the water saves us but by us being obedient to him amen the putting away the filth of flesh is not the answer but the answer of a good conscious God by the resurrection who is gone into heaven what's now what's now who is gone into heaven and is on the right hand of God angels and authorities and Powers being made subject to him I want you to get it now when he rose every devil every Power every Authority every Angel was made subject to him he is Lord Over All are you with me now so he went there as a mighty conqueror he took the keys from Satan of death Hell In The Grave he stripped Satan of his armor he shook off the pain he shook off the agony the afflictions the sickness and even death itself and he broke the doors of death and the Seal of the Tomb and he threw off the grave and it rose up conquering death itself and then he kept ascending I want you to know he kept ascending he ascended and broke through the tomb amen he comes out of the Tomb but he keeps ascending amen he that ascended is also the same that ascended up far above all Heavens that he might feel all in all so he did all of this to become The Stairway to Heaven to make a path through the sins of man that kept man from God's presence he shattered the veil of sickness he shattered the regions of the Shadows of death he scattered the demons that had tormented man and held man back from God's presence he rendered every one of them powerless and as he ascended on high he gave gifts yes sir to the earth and the these gifts would be Avenues they would be channels where His blessings his word and his Spirit could come down to man now God's channel is through Ministry gifts which are channels through which the word flows so watch verse 11 and as he sends these gifts he gave some Apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as pastors and Su is teaching to do what for the perfecting to cause Saints to ascend for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the building up the ascending of the body of Christ how long until how long will we have these gifts amen how long will there be a Ministry how long will be they be effective how long will God use them how long will we need them amen we all come in the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man and how under what measure under the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ I'm talking about a bride ascending yes that's right now so Christ is here the Holy Spirit the angels of God and brother Brams would say I'm merely a mouthpiece for him and Moses was just a mouthpiece and Jesus was a mouthpiece for God and he died to redeem us sinners that the program of God might be carried on down to the age through the church and ministers that are consecrated to God become channels where God can speak through and preach the gospel heal the sick and show signs and wonders amen yes sir amen now through that golden Avenue the grand stairway of Jesus man can now come in the presence of God I want you to see this let's go to John 14 and verse 6 Jesus said unto them I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me amen you know all this nonsense about old the brides now the mediator there's one mediator between God and man that's the man Christ Jesus that is your only approach to God ever Jesus said I am the way I am the truth I am the life no man cometh to the father but by me I am the stairway the ladder that Jacob saw the pathway made in the heaven Where Angels can come down that ladder and Ascend ascending and descending bringing Heaven down to earth now I want you to look at this in Genesis 28:12 Jacob dreamed and behold a ladder was set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold angels of God ascending and descending on this ladder now Jacob saw it Jacob experienced Heaven coming down through a way a Stairway a ladder but Jacob was a sinful man and it could not be anchored or made P permanent in Jacob amen but God said there will be a stone that I will lay in Zion it will be a precious stone it will be a tried Stone it'll be someone I can anchor to and he will be the way or the entrance into Heaven's life and Heaven's power amen and in heaven the ladder is hooked to the heart of God but now on Earth in Christ Jesus God had a place to Anchor it and because Jesus was the chief Corner Stone Hallelujah so he hooked it into Christ and there it anchored and there's no slipping there's no sliding there's no removing of the way if it was the way yesterday it's the way today if it was the way 2,000 years ago it's the way today amen what is it hooked back to God above by the Son of God beneath it's the pathway the Traveler's way from Heaven to glory and you can't fail amen come on Amen the Bible said even a fool won't air amen you get on this way not even a fool Will air amen listen it's it is there where great companies of angels they ascend and descend picking up the weary picking up the sick healing their bodies showing Visions bringing signs and wonders it can't fail it can't slip it can't slide you're safe there's a way made direct to the throne it's there now so what are you scared about you see our PR is hooked between God and Christ and we're in between there Angels ascending and descending and all the trials of Life climbing higher and higher East day East Day brings us one realm higher amen higher as we move up and up that's what I keep trying to tell you you know keep taking another step keep moving on higher keep ascending if I follow along the road or something happens to me there's a great host of Angels standing there to pick me up amen we're marching toward Zion toward that beautiful city of God now Jesus is the way now Philip having met Jesus he went and told Nathaniel that he had found the Messiah it was Jesus of Nazareth and and of course Nathaniel protested you know how can anything good come out of nazus well Philip just said we'll come and see so he gets in the presence of Jesus and Nathaniel comeing you know as he approached John 147 he saw Nathaniel coming to him and said behold an Israel in whom there's no God here's an honest Israelite here's a man that's really honest at heart verse 48 said Nathaniel said to him when did you know me Philip Jesus answered and said before that Philip called thee when thou was under the vict tree I saw thee John and and look look he said Nathaniel answered and said unto him Rabbi Thou Art the son of God D the king of Israel and Jesus answered and said to them because I said un Thee I saw thee under the vict Tre believest thou Thou shalt see greater things than this now notice here Thou shalt see greater things than this cuz you believed because I saw you under the Victory and you believed H you know you're going to see greater things than this if you're able to see that I'm I'm the Son of God if you're able to see if you are able to see if you can recognize me being king of Israel then that puts you in a position where you're going to see greater things you see you'll never see the great things of God until first you see him as Lord of your life King are you with me and when you see that that I'm the connection between Heaven and Earth then verse 51 says and he said unto him verely verely I say to you Hereafter ye shall see Heavens open and the angels of God ascended and descended on the son of man if you can see if you can understand if you can receive that I the king if you can receive it that that I am the Son of God if you can receive this then you're going to see also Heaven open yes and you will see that when Heaven's open you'll see the angels of God ascending and descending on the son of man you will see that I am the ladder through which the channel through which the blessings flow now if we could only get in our position to recognize him then we'll see healing take place in our bodies when we then we see Joy come and we'll see great things happen you see just get in a position to recognize him who he is it's why we're preaching what we're preaching today want you to recognize want you to recognize Satan has no legal rights he is stripped completely powerless now now of course then once you recognize you get in that position of seeing him as Lord as the ruler of your life then in that position angels can then Ascend and descend upon the sons of man so there on the day of Pentecost when 120 recognized him as more than a man but as the Son of God the king and they received of his lordship as Peter held the keys to the door of the Kingdom by repentance and being baptized in his name and accepting the remission of sins and that open the door to the stairway where the Holy Ghost could descend are you with me church amen so there through the way the stairway the ladder the Holy Ghost uh descended and Heaven came down now to live in man Hallelujah just bring Heaven around you but bring Heaven in you you see this is exactly where it must start the kingdom doesn't start restoring the Earth the kingdom doesn't start even restoring your flesh to Perfection the kingdom starts in the heart of man and when God restores your heart and he becomes king of your life that's right there he exalts you and sunship and he makes a ladder between you and Christ pris is in your heart amen and there the blessings flow and Heaven comes down to live in you Hallelujah and you are living then in Heavenly places in the believer's position in Christ Jesus with every devil under your feet triumphant Victorious Overcomers now see you see you see through the way through the stairway opened up Heaven came down to live in man the king and the kingdom was now within them Peter at the gate called Beautiful showed Kingdom authority of a son who is placed in position of sunship given by father by the father you know Jesus wasn't no longer there to heal right amen he had ascended into Glory but now he's got a representative on Earth amen he's got a place he's got a channel through which Heaven can come which the Holy Ghost can move and listen he don't just get the Holy Ghost so he can jump and scream and shout but no he does it even more than this he does this in order to control to cast Satan out I want you to understand Peter at the gate called Beautiful showed Kingdom authority of a son who is placed in a position of sunship given by the father Jesus wasn't there to heal the that's right amen but the redeemed adopted son was now on the scene and said Peter you're in the Kingdom you're on the throne you're enthroned in a Heavenly position of authority you are air the adoption robe is on you the ring is on your finger you are authorized to operate and act in his name whatever you bind is bound whatever loose you lose you have a right now to bring Heaven down to this crippled man and he said silver and gold I don't have but what I got I have the kingdom I represent the king and the kingdom I am a channel through which the blessings can flow now as an adopted son now as a placed son I can I can say to the crippled man rise up and walk and bring Heaven down to this man and this man just in Heavenly places and he goes leaping and praising God Amen s over his triple [Applause] conditionall Hallelujah why because why a man had in entered into the door of Heaven that's right he had the keys to the entrance amen he had the pathway that had been made and now the Holy Ghost is Flowing down through in that channel to bring healing to the sick let me tell you as a son or daughter of God you have a right to ascend any time any day any hour before the throne and ask for anything you have need of Amen let's go to Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 14 Hebrews 4 verse4 I'm working hard to bring this to you but listen to this seeing that that we have a great high priest how many believes we have a high priest that is passed into the heavens he's ascended into Heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession let's don't give up on what our claim is allow me to prayer face this verse 15 for we have a high priest which can be touched with the feelings of our infirmities for he knows our Humanity for he was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin so I want you to get it I want you to get not only do we have a man amen that we see taking the book but we got a man Before the Throne who is our Advocate who is our goet who is our approach to God God that any time any day any hour any minute you can Ascend through the way he made to the presence of Jesus Christ and say Jesus I need this from the spirit of God let the spirit of God flow down flow down the Chanel to the need amen the Bible said he could be touched touched he's not out of touch I'm trying to tell you something Jesus is not out of touch he's not out of touch for you I don't care how lost you've been how much of a sinner you've been how Wicked you've been how sick you've been he's not out of touch he's not Out Of Reach he's within your reach right now you can Ascend into his presence and come before the throne for any need for every petition and no devil can keep you from him and no sin can hold you back he is still the high priest and as you as you are and you as one who is to bring God's rule on the earth For You Will Rule as priest and Kings where on the earth for you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and as an adopted Place son you are positioned with authority over every devil so that in my name in my stad you're going to act in my name in my stad you're going to be here on the Earth you will do what I did you will live like I live you will overcome like I overcome you will have power like I have power Hallelujah you're positioned with authority over every devil so in my name in my stead you will cast out Devils you will speak the language of Heaven you will take control over the serpent and his bite will not harm you cuz the blood is too rich Hallelujah the blood is too rich his poison is cancelled yes sir I said his poison is cancelled amen there is no son or daughter of God going to die of the bite of the serpent amen his poison has been cancelled and rendered harmless therefore verse 16 let us therefore come how somebody say it with me boldly unto the throne of grace that we might obtain mercy and find Grace to help in our time of need so Satan can threaten us he can Bluff us he can try to intimidate us but he cannot stop us amen he cannot stop you from going boldly before the throne of grace amen Satan has no legal rights he might claim rights over over you but Jesus rendered them void and illegal what you did Satan was not legal but by Deceit by Lies by deception you stole it from man but I'm here to put it back in order again I'm here to be Lord over their lives that the kingdom can come into the hearts of men and women and the Holy Ghost can Reign and the Prince of Peace can be on the inside and there from that Prince of Peace I can bring all nature All Around Me subject to that Holy Ghost Hallelujah so you see as we Ascend on the ladder Satan opposes and he Wars against us but only with words he has no weapons you're on the King's Highway nothing can stop you amen now brother Brad and speak to this rock said the devil hates me and he says I know he hates you too how many can concur with that the devil hates me and I know he hates you too and he's my enemy but as long as God is my friend I have no fear of him I just drive him right on back take the word of God and move him right on back out of the place that he thinks he's a holding he hasn't got no strongholds he's absolutely legally defeated in every place the devil hasn't got one legal right at all nowhere he's just a devil and he says a password I think he means a by word that's all he hasn't got no legal right to any man that will accept the promise of Jesus Christ he's whipped he is whipped in sickness he is whipped in disappointments he is whipped in everything he's whipped in death he can't scare me he can't scare you that's all he is is a big Shadow amen now you're on the ladder so here he comes with his haunting Spirits saying you don't belong there you're not really who you say you are you don't think he will do that oh he's bold he's bold but you got to be bolder that's right come on and you got to take and say I am who he said I am I am
