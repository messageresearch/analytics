[41:21] forth and people are dying and troubles
[41:25] of ever hand Lord we know that it's
[41:27] going to require the token the Holy
[41:29] Spirit there to keep back the death
[41:32] angel in this age and this time Lord God

[42:17] turn again with me to Revelation chapter
[42:18] five and we'll we'll read a verse of
[42:23] scripture here actually I have seven
[42:27] verses that we will read this morning
[42:30] and then we will do a little bit of a
[42:33] review from last Sunday and then we will
[42:36] go into some new material as we go along
[42:39] but I want to kind of bring your minds
[42:41] and hearts back to this this topic that
[42:45] I have today we're going to be speaking
[42:48] on the abstract of title so if you own
[42:52] if you look here with me in Revelation 5
[42:55] and verse 1 and I saw in the right hand
[42:59] of him that sat on the throne a book
[43:01] written within and on the backside
[43:03] sealed with seven seals and I saw a
[43:07] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[43:09] voice who is worthy to open the book and
[43:12] to loose the seals thereof and no man in
[43:15] heaven nor in earth neither under the
[43:17] earth was able to open the book neither
[43:19] to look thereon and I wept much because
[43:22] no man was found worthy to open and to
[43:26] read the book neither
[43:28] look their own and one of the elders
[43:29] said unto me we'd not behold the Lion of
[43:32] the tribe of Judah the root of David
[43:34] hath prevailed to open the book and to
[43:37] loose the seven seals thereof and I
[43:40] beheld and lo in the midst of the throne
[43:42] and the four beasts in the midst of the
[43:45] elders stood a lamb as it had been slain
[43:48] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[43:51] are the seven spirits of God sent forth
[43:54] into all the earth and he came and took
[43:57] the book out of the right hand of him
[43:59] that sat upon the throne a man god bless
[44:02] you you can be seated certainly our
[44:06] hearts have been set to rejoicing this
[44:08] week as we announced that my daughter
[44:13] Esther and their husband Jeff are
[44:15] expecting a baby and we are so thankful
[44:18] to the Lord for answering prayers and I
[44:21] want to say I appreciate your prayers
[44:23] and all of this and your continued
[44:27] prayers as some G moves toward a given
[44:32] birth somewhere the first of November
[44:34] around that time so we want to thank the
[44:37] Lord for His goodness to us amen and oh
[44:41] I sister Nita sent me a little part from
[44:47] the internet showing that the desert
[44:50] around the the Dead Sea is also having a
[44:54] revival and seeds are coming to life
[44:56] that hasn't sprung forth in years and
[44:59] years and it just shows us the barren
[45:03] has given life I believe that a barren
[45:06] church is given life we're gonna give
[45:08] them we're gonna bring for Jesus Christ
[45:10] back to the earth again amen before he
[45:14] comes he's gonna be manifested fully in
[45:16] bride that formed a man and see the Holy
[45:20] Spirit work in great power and great
[45:23] glory so we appreciate you appreciate
[45:25] your prayers and and your continued
[45:28] prayers for brother Ron Spencer he's
[45:31] doing well and God is is performing a
[45:34] miracle and we're we're glad to be a
[45:37] part of that miracle
[45:39] as I keep saying we're walking in a
[45:41] vision and I believe that we have we are
[45:44] here in the very mind and the very
[45:47] purpose of God and we're here for this
[45:50] day in this age in this time for a great
[45:54] purpose that God is ordained as we look
[45:57] into the scripture this morning and I
[46:02] just begin with just a little bit of
[46:04] review and I'll try not be too long in
[46:06] that but I didn't want to just kind of
[46:09] bring the whole audience and the unseen
[46:13] audience as well up to speed as to where
[46:17] we are in this subject and take it
[46:19] forward from here because as you know
[46:23] with my account writing in a chapter of
[46:28] the book of Acts this last Sunday and
[46:30] spending 45 minutes telling about what
[46:33] the Lord was doing we didn't have a lot
[46:36] of time to get into this subject this
[46:37] morning so we want to carry it forward
[46:40] from here and hoped on hopefully the
[46:43] Lord will just inspire us by the Holy
[46:45] Spirit and inspire you and open up your
[46:48] understanding that the eyes of your
[46:51] understanding would be enlightened that
[46:53] you can know the hope of your calling
[46:54] this is a wonderful scripture that we're
[46:57] looking at here as we are I believe that
[47:03] this is very revelant to our day in our
[47:06] time 2000 years ago John saw it of
[47:10] course in symbols and he wrote it in the
[47:13] Bible in a symbolic form as the book of
[47:16] Revelation is mostly symbolic because
[47:19] God held its understanding back unto the
[47:25] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[47:27] when he began to sound the mystery of
[47:30] God would be finished we look here at
[47:32] this revelation 5 and we also understand
[47:35] that there is also another portion of
[47:39] its opening and that is by revelation it
[47:43] is by revelation that it is given to a
[47:46] prophet and then finally there will be a
[47:50] that will
[47:51] a literal taking of the book because the
[47:55] believers are that book and will be
[47:57] raptured so it's all symbolic and in
[48:00] speaking of what God will do here in
[48:03] this endtime process and it begins with
[48:07] one sitting on the throne and there is a
[48:10] book that is being held by this one on
[48:13] the throne that is sealed with seven
[48:14] seals it is a book of title but none can
[48:19] claim it it is a deed to an inheritance
[48:22] but there is no man that is worthy who
[48:25] can take it and so we find then that the
[48:29] one up on the throne becomes the Lamb of
[48:32] God to take away the sin of the world
[48:35] and becomes a man and as being a man he
[48:40] will be the worthy one that will step
[48:42] forth to claim the book he's the only
[48:44] one that is worthy because every other
[48:48] man was born in sin and under the curse
[48:52] of sin and so he could not redeem his
[48:54] self so therefore no man was worthy to
[48:57] be able to redeem or claim what Adam
[49:01] lost at the beginning because this is
[49:03] what this book contains is the title to
[49:06] everything that Adam lost in the fall
[49:09] Adam once controlled the earth he was
[49:11] the dresser of the garden he did it all
[49:14] by the word as a son of God
[49:16] now he said to this mountain be thou
[49:20] removed he spoke to the trees and moved
[49:23] them by the word he controlled the winds
[49:25] there was no storms because he
[49:29] controlled the atmospheres we find that
[49:32] Jesus did the same when he came to
[49:34] second Adam and so that kind of gives us
[49:37] a portrayal of what the first Adam was
[49:39] before the fall of course when men fell
[49:42] Adam a forfeit did the title deed to the
[49:45] earth but Satan couldn't take it and so
[49:51] because he couldn't take it then the
[49:54] title deed went back in the hand of
[49:57] Almighty God and and the title is the
[50:01] whole evidence that gives rise to
[50:03] legal right of possession our control
[50:07] and so when man lost and forfeited the
[50:11] title deed the earth he forfeited even
[50:15] the right are the title to his own body
[50:17] which was made of Earth and Satan took
[50:21] the body the spirit and the soul of man
[50:23] and corrupted him and man was robbed of
[50:26] his faith and and began to live in a
[50:30] cycle of fear and man's body was made to
[50:34] be in the image of God and it fell from
[50:37] an immortal state to be in mortal and
[50:41] subject to thorns and thistles just as
[50:44] the earth is and of course we're subject
[50:47] to disease and sickness his body never
[50:50] needed medicine never was sick never had
[50:53] a headache never a stomach problem had
[50:56] become the target then of demons and the
[50:59] evil spirits could now come and take
[51:01] residence in the body that wants only
[51:04] house a son of God and and it was now -
[51:09] the body was now to decay and turn gray
[51:13] and old and feeble until it was brought
[51:16] back to the dust and God came down
[51:20] looking for his son and found him in
[51:23] this sad and deplorable condition he was
[51:27] beaten and deformed and robbed of his
[51:30] inheritance but of course Satan couldn't
[51:33] put a claim on the predestinated seed
[51:36] that was in him a man because that was
[51:40] God and those names were in his book so
[51:43] the book of title deed was now in
[51:46] question as to who owned it and Satan
[51:49] had a claim on it because Adam subjected
[51:52] his self to him and became subservient
[51:54] and God had a claim because he was the
[51:58] original owner and had the first claim
[52:01] and so it goes back in the hands of the
[52:04] of the original owner which is God which
[52:08] will wait until a man who is worthy who
[52:12] can come and take it and claim it back
[52:14] for man
[52:15] and and of course um God was determined
[52:20] is he as he looked upon his fallen
[52:23] creation and he said Adam you have been
[52:25] robbed that you have been cast into
[52:27] Satan's prison house you were born to be
[52:31] free but now you're in bondage to Satan
[52:35] but I'm not gonna let it be that way
[52:37] forever but I'll provide an attorney
[52:42] someone someone who can mediate for you
[52:46] before the court and and can get the
[52:50] book of title back but until then the
[52:54] book is going to be held in escrow which
[52:57] is um in the hands of a third party
[53:00] which is God because the escrow is some
[53:03] money and property a deed or bond put in
[53:06] the custody of a third party for
[53:08] delivery to a grantee only after the
[53:12] fulfillment of the conditions specified
[53:14] so in this case the title deed was then
[53:18] given back into the hands of the king on
[53:21] the throne for delivery to a man who was
[53:26] worthy a man who was without sin
[53:30] so this disputed title we find remains
[53:34] in the hands of God until a worthy man
[53:37] takes the book and there isn't a man
[53:40] that is worthy so as we said God steps
[53:44] out of eternity to become a man in order
[53:48] to take the book but the book is sealed
[53:51] and it cannot be open until the seals
[53:54] are removed and every claim against it
[53:57] must be taken off and the removing of it
[54:01] seals are the given of an abstract now
[54:05] an abstract of course is a brief history
[54:08] of the transfers of of a piece of land
[54:11] including all claims that could be made
[54:14] against it so someone must come and pay
[54:19] all the debt that man owes in order for
[54:24] men to take it so cuz there are those
[54:27] claims that are
[54:28] against it and so once the book is open
[54:32] it will give an abstract of title it
[54:36] will show that the claims are now taken
[54:39] off now we wanna pose the question how
[54:44] did the seals get on there to close the
[54:47] book if you notice brother branham tells
[54:50] us in souls in prison now he said it it
[54:53] wasn't for the Old Testament it was this
[54:56] was only for the new because we know
[55:00] that Jesus paid the death of all the Old
[55:03] Testament believers and they were
[55:06] released from sins bondage and the body
[55:10] of corruption to to move from um into it
[55:15] from from the the condition that were as
[55:20] a men who were of the dust who had died
[55:24] and that were changed and transformed
[55:27] that they were raptured if you're if you
[55:30] want to just think about it for a moment
[55:31] this is not going to be the first time
[55:34] that a body changes taking place because
[55:38] the saints of God rose from the dead
[55:41] amen of the Old Testament because Jesus
[55:45] completely and totally claimed the book
[55:49] and he paid the death of all the Old
[55:52] Testament believers and they were
[55:54] released from the holding place of
[55:58] Abraham's bosom to come into the
[56:00] presence of God and so they were
[56:02] raptured what a wonderful thing that is
[56:05] that Jesus his blood has are paid and
[56:10] redeemed all of the Old Testament
[56:12] believers he didn't evil one of them in
[56:16] that holding place there was no sin that
[56:20] was underneath the Old Covenant that was
[56:23] not that was not paid for every one of
[56:27] them had sinned and fallen short of the
[56:29] glory of God every one of them had
[56:32] transgressed the law all the way from
[56:35] from Adam all the way down to the teeth
[56:38] on the cross
[56:39] every one of them was transgressors but
[56:43] Jesus paid it off a man and to prove
[56:46] that the price of his blood was
[56:48] sufficient it lifted him all of those
[56:51] from paradise and change them in a
[56:55] moment in a twinkling of an eye and
[56:57] there they appeared unto thee unto the
[57:00] believers that was there according to
[57:02] the book of Matthew and and so we know
[57:05] that Jesus paid the debt and completely
[57:09] end-to-end totally and and when the book
[57:13] was on when the book of title was was to
[57:17] be given to there we know that Jesus sat
[57:21] down to become the mediator to atone for
[57:25] every name that was in the book because
[57:29] it was still more to be manifested on
[57:31] the earth and so he would dare be the
[57:34] mercy seat he would be the approach to
[57:38] God he would be our way of salvation for
[57:41] every man down through every age and
[57:45] Jesus would remain on that seat of mercy
[57:49] and he does until the last predestinated
[57:53] seat of God is dipped in blood and
[57:57] retained a man and then the rapture
[58:00] takes place and all the dead in Christ
[58:02] from the past 2,000 years will rise from
[58:07] the grave and in a pen again appear to
[58:10] one another and to the living and we
[58:13] will be all changed and be caught up to
[58:15] meet the Lord in the air aren't you
[58:18] dived with that promise this morning
[58:20] what a beautiful redemption story but
[58:24] now when when Paul read the will and the
[58:29] testament remember that every every
[58:32] promise of God was open to us there was
[58:37] nothing that was clouded on the deed
[58:40] there was nothing clouded on the
[58:42] understanding on the revelation every
[58:45] bit of it was open and plain and
[58:48] revealed Paul would read from the way
[58:53] he would actually read from this open
[58:56] book to us he would read it you have
[58:58] been chosen before the foundation of the
[59:02] world you are accepted in the beloved
[59:05] you are predestinated to adoption of
[59:09] children by Jesus Christ to himself and
[59:13] those are the disciples they were as I
[59:16] said they were reading from an open book
[59:20] there was water water baptism it wasn't
[59:23] shrouded as to whether you immerse or
[59:26] whether you dip or whether you just
[59:29] going to pour little water on their head
[59:31] or sprinkle something and some little
[59:34] holy water from a rose or something you
[59:37] know it wasn't it wasn't no question
[59:39] about it
[59:40] there was no question over the formula
[59:42] of baptism everyone was baptized in the
[59:47] name of the Lord Jesus Christ hey man it
[59:50] wasn't a mystery it wasn't hidden it
[59:53] wasn't shrouded it wasn't sealed the
[59:57] understanding was clear and precise and
[59:59] it was open all the early believers
[1:00:02] believed in one God not a trinity of
[1:00:05] gods a man they there was nobody
[1:00:09] confused on whether it was one Lord or
[1:00:12] two Lords they all knew there was one
[1:00:14] Lord a man they could trace the
[1:00:17] Serpent's trail all the way from Eden
[1:00:20] right to their present time and as Paul
[1:00:22] revealed as a serpent beguiled Eve I
[1:00:25] fear that you will be beguiled and lose
[1:00:28] your virginity as he did and of course
[1:00:32] we can now see that his fears were not
[1:00:35] unfounded as the Bible exposes the
[1:00:39] organized Church as the horror of
[1:00:41] sitting upon many waters with multitudes
[1:00:44] of people ruling over them and so in the
[1:00:49] first stage the Anti Christ though he
[1:00:51] would begin to ride and he would come as
[1:00:55] an impersonating spirit and he was
[1:00:59] posing as Christ on a white horse but it
[1:01:04] was in Christ at all it was a
[1:01:06] spirit of nickel Anthon ism a man and he
[1:01:10] would go to conquer the church and
[1:01:13] subdue it and to close the promises of
[1:01:17] God up through the believers and seal it
[1:01:20] away were that understanding wouldn't be
[1:01:24] there and then the Antichrist would seal
[1:01:27] more truths from the church by changed
[1:01:30] him from the white horse to the red
[1:01:32] horse now I'm quoting all of this
[1:01:35] referring to the seven seals of the book
[1:01:37] of Revelation and the Antichrist would
[1:01:40] seal more truths away from the church
[1:01:43] changing from the white to the red with
[1:01:46] and with the sword he would go out and
[1:01:49] use them with his power the support of
[1:01:53] governments and kings and then he would
[1:01:55] go and stamp out the truth by putting
[1:01:58] them putting people to the sword and
[1:02:01] according just to UM just such as some
[1:02:05] of the smallest estimates out there
[1:02:07] there were 68 million that were
[1:02:10] slaughtered during that time and we're
[1:02:13] that any light of truth and any ray of
[1:02:16] truth on that was opposing the Roman
[1:02:20] Church would would actually be put to
[1:02:23] death and so again that it would be it
[1:02:27] would be using that to sequester and to
[1:02:30] seal the truth away somebody with me now
[1:02:35] and then the Antichrist would seal more
[1:02:37] truths away as he morphed over and he
[1:02:41] changes from what from red now to black
[1:02:44] and then the black horse rider would
[1:02:47] represent the dark ages and where that
[1:02:51] the priesthood of Roma would even sell
[1:02:55] offering for money a measure of wheat
[1:02:58] for you know their measure of barley
[1:03:01] representing the the staff of life the
[1:03:03] bread of life and then doing so the
[1:03:07] church would sell indulgences which
[1:03:10] means permission to sins if you notice
[1:03:14] this great thing what they call here of
[1:03:17] Mardi Gras that's going on
[1:03:19] around you and that just means a grand
[1:03:21] party and what it is is before the fast
[1:03:26] begins sub it commemorating I think it's
[1:03:29] son I forget to ask Wednesday or
[1:03:31] whatever and they're they're getting
[1:03:34] ready now for Easter to come in so you
[1:03:37] know all the Catholics how throw a big
[1:03:39] party where you going to be and you just
[1:03:43] celebrate and you you you know if you're
[1:03:46] giving up chocolates for Lent well then
[1:03:48] you've been jumped Auklet you're giving
[1:03:50] up alcohol for a few days you binge on
[1:03:53] alcohol and you do this binge before you
[1:03:56] go on a fast
[1:03:57] sounds real spiritual doesn't it but you
[1:04:01] see they made that something very
[1:04:03] spiritual and so they they begin their
[1:04:07] party you know because again they're
[1:04:10] praying they offer prayers on foreign to
[1:04:14] pray your loved ones out of purgatory
[1:04:17] and then and of course all of these
[1:04:20] things was given given freely by Christ
[1:04:25] but now the church under that nicholae
[1:04:29] in his spirit is charging charging money
[1:04:33] for what Jesus paid for and gave us
[1:04:37] freely and man and so again finally the
[1:04:42] the last horse rider rides and he that
[1:04:45] rides on him is death and he'll follows
[1:04:49] as a church plunges into the Great
[1:04:53] Tribulation now sealed also what's the
[1:04:57] truth of the salvation of the Jews as
[1:04:59] shown in the fifth seal and then finally
[1:05:02] was to be a tribulation were under the
[1:05:05] sixth seal God's judgment would be
[1:05:08] poured out leaving only the seventh seal
[1:05:11] represented by silence which holds the
[1:05:14] mystery of the unfolding of all the
[1:05:16] endtime events and it unleashes
[1:05:22] something here because it breaks the
[1:05:24] silence what has been silenced and held
[1:05:28] back
[1:05:29] and the revelation of truths that have
[1:05:31] been held back to the end time gets
[1:05:34] released under the Seventh Seal which is
[1:05:37] which begins the very process of the
[1:05:40] coming of the Lord now we often think of
[1:05:42] the rapture as a moment in a twinkling
[1:05:45] of en't that's the change of the body
[1:05:47] but the rapture is a process it begins
[1:05:51] with the shout of voice and in a Trump
[1:05:53] and these are three things the Lord does
[1:05:55] as he descends so he does these things
[1:05:59] by bringing a shout which is a message
[1:06:02] and that message is to turn the hearts
[1:06:04] of the children back to the faith of the
[1:06:06] fathers and then it is a voice of the
[1:06:10] Archangel we which culminates in the
[1:06:13] resurrection of the dead in Christ and
[1:06:16] then the change of the body and then
[1:06:18] we're caught up to meet the Lord in the
[1:06:21] air all of that is part of the great
[1:06:23] rapture event that we're talking about
[1:06:26] so when we speak about rapture there's
[1:06:29] there's phases to the things that God is
[1:06:32] doing and I believe that we are in a
[1:06:34] very rapturing moment it's an hour of
[1:06:38] restoration where God is turning the
[1:06:41] hearts of the children back to the faith
[1:06:43] of the fathers where he is bringing the
[1:06:46] barren Church to life a man that she
[1:06:50] will she's been who's he been wanting to
[1:06:53] bring forth Christ back to the earth for
[1:06:55] 2,000 years remember today we are really
[1:07:00] under expectation because we see the
[1:07:04] signs that are that are taking place and
[1:07:07] the birth planes that are coming around
[1:07:08] and even the earth is going into travail
[1:07:12] of birth as it's getting ready to birth
[1:07:14] a world and by the burning of it and go
[1:07:17] into a millennial reign where Christ
[1:07:20] will rule well rule and reign with his
[1:07:22] bride for a thousand years but as we
[1:07:26] were saying the seventh seal it breaks
[1:07:28] the silence it unleashes a chain of
[1:07:32] events until the bride is raptured and
[1:07:34] the tribulation sets in where the false
[1:07:37] churches judge and the deceived church
[1:07:40] is given white
[1:07:42] that's the church that goes to the
[1:07:44] tribulation and then the the 144,000
[1:07:49] although Israel let me correct that
[1:07:52] they're not given white road but they
[1:07:54] wash the rugs in the blood of the Lamb
[1:07:55] and then the hundred and forty-four
[1:07:58] thousand of Israel is sealed in and
[1:08:00] finally the Millennium begins bringing
[1:08:03] the fullness of the title possession
[1:08:05] back to man again as the man Christ
[1:08:08] Jesus and his bride will rule for a
[1:08:11] thousand years so this is why the book
[1:08:16] was sealed although it was open to the
[1:08:20] early church and they wrote a book of
[1:08:22] Acts it became closed off and his truth
[1:08:25] and his mysteries and power was lost but
[1:08:31] I want you to to understand and let it
[1:08:35] get cemented in your heart this morning
[1:08:38] now what we are preaching is not another
[1:08:41] gospel it is the gospel of Paul being
[1:08:46] restored back to the church
[1:08:48] you say brother tm1 the Bible became a
[1:08:51] new book to brother Branham when the
[1:08:53] seals was opened that is because he now
[1:08:55] understood things as it was originally
[1:08:58] taught it was not a new understanding it
[1:09:02] was not a new Bible it was not a new
[1:09:06] doctrine it was not a new truth other
[1:09:08] than the symbols in the book of
[1:09:10] Revelation were now made plain and
[1:09:12] revealed as to who the white the red the
[1:09:14] black the pale horse riders were and so
[1:09:17] on but now you remember you remember
[1:09:20] Paul said the world will be judged
[1:09:24] according to my gospel and he said if an
[1:09:28] angel come from heaven and he said if I
[1:09:31] or even an angel he said I can't change
[1:09:34] the word of it and he said an angel EB
[1:09:37] comes from heaven and he goes to change
[1:09:40] a word of this gospel let him be
[1:09:43] accursed
[1:09:45] and man it is not something that can be
[1:09:47] added to or taken away from it is
[1:09:51] something that must be believed as it
[1:09:53] was revealed and opened unto the Apostle
[1:09:56] Paul when he separated love and grace a
[1:10:00] man so the world will be judged by my
[1:10:04] gospel and when brother Branham went
[1:10:07] beyond the curtain and he too was told
[1:10:09] he would be judged all he wanted to know
[1:10:11] all he want to know is Paul is Paul will
[1:10:15] he be judged the same way because I
[1:10:18] preached the same thing he did a man and
[1:10:23] I know if Paul is accepted then I will
[1:10:27] be accepted hallelujah Amen so you see
[1:10:32] what we have today is is is not a new
[1:10:35] gospel but it is a restoration of the
[1:10:39] same gospel among that Jesus said this
[1:10:43] gospel of the kingdom must be preached
[1:10:45] in all the world and then saw the income
[1:10:49] and today I am so glad to be able to say
[1:10:53] that we're living in the time the day
[1:10:56] the hour were the gospel that according
[1:10:59] to st. Paul is preached again and the
[1:11:02] Holy Spirit is going behind it
[1:11:04] confirming the word with signs following
[1:11:07] hey man now so before the book of title
[1:11:12] could be opened by the lamb its seals
[1:11:15] would have to be removed so there had to
[1:11:18] be a title search so the lamb works on
[1:11:22] earth through his agent that Elijah the
[1:11:24] prophet to make a brief history of the
[1:11:27] transfers of the property including all
[1:11:30] the claims that were made against it so
[1:11:34] we can see it then it was taken and it
[1:11:37] was handed down from from Paul to
[1:11:40] Iranians to Martin to Columba to Luther
[1:11:43] - Wesley and then finally to the last
[1:11:46] age and the last messenger brother
[1:11:48] Brandon so you see the again he starts
[1:11:53] with Ephesus and does a title search all
[1:11:56] the way down
[1:11:57] Laodicea I'm looking for the claims that
[1:12:01] Satan had against the church a man the
[1:12:07] first organization Rome the Trinity of
[1:12:10] gods of three gods folks baptism of
[1:12:13] Father Son and Holy Ghost trailing the
[1:12:16] serpent right down a man and of course
[1:12:19] we know the call was for a worthy man
[1:12:22] and we know brother Branham couldn't
[1:12:25] open the book he wasn't worthy it would
[1:12:30] be the armor that would open the book
[1:12:33] because only Christ is the one that is
[1:12:36] worthy and so the call goes forth o
[1:12:39] worthy man and there there is much work
[1:12:43] and much effort of the devil today to
[1:12:47] try to render ineffective this worthy
[1:12:51] man and just trivialize him now actually
[1:12:57] the Church of Rome has been doing this
[1:12:59] for years they trivialize Jesus by
[1:13:03] making you pray to Mary and they
[1:13:07] absolutely did away it's somebody with
[1:13:09] me that did away with the father himself
[1:13:12] a man and made him justice angry
[1:13:16] something that was in the back that
[1:13:18] we're trying to appease but but I want
[1:13:21] you to understand again this is what the
[1:13:24] church has done through the ages has
[1:13:27] tried to trivialize and to and to and to
[1:13:34] to take away the glory of Jesus Christ
[1:13:38] and render ineffective this worthy one
[1:13:42] now I want to talk about that for a
[1:13:44] little while because brother Branham
[1:13:46] said in Daviess in church age he said
[1:13:48] see what was getting back there that
[1:13:50] false vine was getting a hold and it was
[1:13:54] teaching that rulership by man was right
[1:13:58] he had taught that the church had to be
[1:14:01] governed it taught of control over the
[1:14:04] people but instead of doing it God's Way
[1:14:07] they simply took a
[1:14:09] Ardi invested all the spirits of power
[1:14:12] in their own hands and came out with the
[1:14:15] holy priesthood standing between God and
[1:14:18] the people they went right back to the
[1:14:21] old Arabic system they became analyze
[1:14:25] now listen they became analyzed for they
[1:14:29] dispose of his me notorious ship and
[1:14:33] impose their own and God hated that and
[1:14:38] the Ephesians hated that and any true
[1:14:41] believer will hate it too how many true
[1:14:45] believers we got so we will hate
[1:14:47] anything that man will do to try to
[1:14:51] dispose them mediatorial ship of Jesus
[1:14:55] Christ and then we must recognize him as
[1:15:00] the only intercessor between God and man
[1:15:04] and man our only approach to God
[1:15:07] remember it is the spirit of Rome it is
[1:15:09] the Roman spirit that is supposed to
[1:15:12] mediate or a ship and impose their own
[1:15:14] and the same is true you can watch that
[1:15:18] same nickel and in spirits even in other
[1:15:22] movements even those with message titles
[1:15:26] on them claiming to believe the message
[1:15:29] because in doing so they try to make it
[1:15:33] that Christ is no longer interceding and
[1:15:36] they only interceded for the ignorance
[1:15:39] of the ages and that once the word is
[1:15:42] coming he no longer intercedes well he
[1:15:46] did intercede fragrance but in fact
[1:15:49] there's still a lot of need for
[1:15:52] interceding for ignorance because it's
[1:15:55] pretty ignorant to believe that that's
[1:15:58] all that he interceded for because he
[1:16:02] didn't just intercede fragrance he
[1:16:05] interceded for sin he interceded for
[1:16:09] your healing
[1:16:11] not just the in their ignorance of the
[1:16:14] ages and as long as their sickness we
[1:16:17] need an intercessor as long as their sin
[1:16:19] we need an intercessor and as long as
[1:16:23] there's revelation need to come to you
[1:16:25] individually you need an intercessor
[1:16:27] because you're not going to get a
[1:16:29] revelation except by the Holy Spirit
[1:16:32] that's the only way revelation can come
[1:16:36] heals by the Holy Spirit but the problem
[1:16:39] today is we have men are not led by the
[1:16:42] Holy Ghost but it is carnal minded man
[1:16:45] who are pretending to be experts in the
[1:16:48] message the self imported man are
[1:16:51] masquerading as preachers and they're
[1:16:54] really men without the Holy Ghost and
[1:16:56] they have no true calling a man but are
[1:17:01] inspired of Satan oh yeah I'm talking
[1:17:04] very strong inspired of Satan to say
[1:17:07] that Christ has left the mercy seat and
[1:17:10] that there's and let me just define it
[1:17:13] that is nothing more than a spirit of
[1:17:16] the Antichrist a nickel alien spirit
[1:17:19] that is trying to take away the role of
[1:17:22] the worthy one now let me qualify this
[1:17:28] because you might find an isolated quote
[1:17:31] that seems to say this but when you
[1:17:34] examine the subject of all that the
[1:17:37] Prophet said you can only come to the
[1:17:40] conclusion that Christ is still the seat
[1:17:43] of mercy and the only intercessor
[1:17:47] between God and man and that we need him
[1:17:51] there to intercede on the behalf of us
[1:17:53] as sinners not only from the loss but
[1:17:57] those of us today because of our
[1:18:00] doubting because of our disbelieving and
[1:18:05] Men because of us floundering on the
[1:18:07] promise that he makes up for our
[1:18:11] mistakes
[1:18:12] I'm so glad to say that there is an
[1:18:16] intercessor a man be close as long as
[1:18:19] you are in these mortal bodies you're
[1:18:21] going to need somebody there to help you
[1:18:24] with your carnality a man you're gonna
[1:18:28] need Jesus you're gonna be able to have
[1:18:30] to call on him you're gonna have to have
[1:18:33] them intercede for you a man now again
[1:18:38] let's get the facts right to be the
[1:18:41] mercy seat is to be the intercessor and
[1:18:45] that means you are the sacrifice and
[1:18:48] there is no preacher there is no group
[1:18:52] of believers whether we call them bride
[1:18:54] of church or whatever that can be the in
[1:18:56] assessor aren't the mercy seat now let's
[1:19:01] just go to Romans chapter 3 and verse 25
[1:19:04] I want to go through some of this and
[1:19:10] I've already taken longer on my review
[1:19:12] than what I wanted to so we're kicking
[1:19:15] over time be prepared Romans 3:25 whom
[1:19:23] God has set forth to be a propitiation
[1:19:25] now that word perpetuation is also
[1:19:29] translated in many versions mercy seat
[1:19:33] so God set forth Christ to be the mercy
[1:19:39] seat the place of mercy are the blood of
[1:19:44] mercy through faith in his blood to
[1:19:49] declare his righteousness for the
[1:19:52] remission of sins that are past through
[1:19:55] the forbearance of God now we know in my
[1:19:59] definition we first find out about the
[1:20:02] mercy seat by Moses constructing one in
[1:20:07] the wilderness the mercy seat in the
[1:20:10] wilderness Tabernacle was the lid to the
[1:20:14] Ark of the Covenant were the tablets of
[1:20:16] stone were put in and it was carried out
[1:20:21] throughout the wilderness for years and
[1:20:22] finally have found a home in the temple
[1:20:24] in
[1:20:25] Jerusalem blood of Mercy was sprinkled
[1:20:28] on the mercy seat or the place of
[1:20:31] satisfaction our appeasement this was
[1:20:35] done yearly on the Day of Atonement
[1:20:38] which covered the sins of the people
[1:20:40] until Jesus sprinkled his blood on the
[1:20:43] mercy seat in heaven so what I want to
[1:20:46] get you this talk to you that that again
[1:20:49] that the this mercy seat is the place of
[1:20:55] satisfaction is where the penalty of sin
[1:20:59] is met and the way that is met on this
[1:21:05] mercy seat now remember without blood
[1:21:08] it's a judgement seat but when the blood
[1:21:12] of mercy is put on it it becomes a seat
[1:21:15] of mercy and it would make an approach
[1:21:18] to God for the children of Israel now
[1:21:21] again I just want to bring it down now
[1:21:25] though then if a bride because people
[1:21:28] are saying today well you know there's
[1:21:30] no mercy as he Christ nothing on the
[1:21:32] seat of mercy anymore he he left that
[1:21:35] seat of mercy because the seals were
[1:21:37] revealed but let me just make something
[1:21:40] very plain to you and bring it down in
[1:21:44] the morph it down so you see what it is
[1:21:47] the bride now is the seat of mercy so if
[1:21:51] the bride a group who calls themself
[1:21:54] names of sub bride is now the mercy seat
[1:21:57] or the place of appeasement then where
[1:22:02] is her blood shed for without the
[1:22:08] shedding of blood there is no remission
[1:22:10] of sin so then what then has here to
[1:22:14] offer as an atonement knowledge will
[1:22:18] never make an atonement come on fruits
[1:22:22] will never make an atonement it's only
[1:22:25] Cain's children that tried to make an
[1:22:27] altar without blood
[1:22:31] Amanda the true seed of God recognizes
[1:22:35] it takes the blood of someone innocent
[1:22:38] to pay the price for my guilt in order
[1:22:42] that I can have an approach to God this
[1:22:46] is why Abel brought a lamb he realized
[1:22:50] something had to die in my place because
[1:22:53] the day we eat there of that day we die
[1:22:55] and death now has been ruled upon us all
[1:22:59] and the only way that I will not die is
[1:23:02] far is for me to offer a lamb in my
[1:23:06] place and that has to be my approach to
[1:23:09] God because without the shedding of
[1:23:12] blood there will be no approach to God
[1:23:15] now turn with me to verse similarly to
[1:23:18] invite for there is one God and one
[1:23:22] mediator between God and men the man
[1:23:27] Christ Jesus so I want you to understand
[1:23:32] it never was the bride
[1:23:34] that was a mediator never was the church
[1:23:38] Church of Rome that was the mediator it
[1:23:43] isn't your little private group or some
[1:23:47] preacher that is the mediator come on
[1:23:51] amen there is but one God these are
[1:23:54] they're trying to be God that's trying
[1:23:57] to remove his deity mm but there is one
[1:24:00] God and one mediator between God and men
[1:24:05] the man Christ Jesus no room for a group
[1:24:10] of people there to be the mediator
[1:24:12] there's no no no no room for three
[1:24:16] billion Catholics to be the mediator
[1:24:18] there and of course you know it's not
[1:24:20] the three billion Catholics that are the
[1:24:22] mediator it's their priesthood that's
[1:24:24] the media and neither is it the bride
[1:24:26] that they're saying is the real mediator
[1:24:28] is this preacher in the pulpit that
[1:24:31] becomes a mediator because he wants to
[1:24:33] be able to dispense mercy are
[1:24:35] withholding mercy
[1:24:38] and this mercy is dispensed and withheld
[1:24:42] on whether or not you line up with my
[1:24:45] beliefs now let's get it clear brother
[1:24:50] branham said the only thing that will
[1:24:52] back off God his blood and there's only
[1:24:56] one blood he'll back from and that's his
[1:24:58] own son and when he sees that's his sons
[1:25:02] sons blood he'll back off in other word
[1:25:05] the wrath of God will not come upon you
[1:25:07] if you have the blood of the Lamb again
[1:25:11] speaking of the center brother Branham
[1:25:13] says and in 1963 in April he says he's
[1:25:17] looking away now to to Calvary where the
[1:25:22] only only the blood of Jesus Christ can
[1:25:25] cleanse him only one blood can make that
[1:25:28] leap across the chasm and that's the
[1:25:32] blood of Jesus it flows within the chasm
[1:25:34] and puts him next to God so he's saying
[1:25:36] there's only one boy a man that that
[1:25:40] will bridge the gap between you and God
[1:25:43] the chasm between you and God that
[1:25:45] brings you back into fellowship but got
[1:25:47] only one blood now to deny that blood
[1:25:51] you are you are dead that you are
[1:25:53] eternally separated from God because
[1:25:58] there is no hope of salvation without
[1:26:01] the atonement of Jesus the blood of
[1:26:04] Jesus
[1:26:04] Hebrews 9:15 for this cause he is the
[1:26:08] mediator of the New Testament
[1:26:10] so notice he is the mediator of this
[1:26:13] book of Testament a man that by means of
[1:26:17] his death for the redemption of the
[1:26:19] transgressions that were first under the
[1:26:22] first Testament that they which are
[1:26:25] called might receive the promise of
[1:26:27] eternal inheritance the me reading again
[1:26:30] for this cause he is a mediator of a New
[1:26:33] Testament that by means of his death
[1:26:36] notice his mediatorial ship is by means
[1:26:40] of him dying in your place and then this
[1:26:44] is why you can approach to God boldly
[1:26:47] because Jesus
[1:26:49] paid your price in full so you can come
[1:26:53] to the throne of grace and find help in
[1:26:56] your time of need
[1:26:58] notice it is a throne of grace our
[1:27:01] throne of mercy it is not a throne of
[1:27:04] judgment hallelujah but without the
[1:27:08] blood is be a throne of judgment and
[1:27:10] without the blood you can find Grace in
[1:27:13] the time of needs
[1:27:14] there's no favor without the blood what
[1:27:18] can wash away my sins nothing but the
[1:27:22] blood of Jesus so some group calls
[1:27:25] himself the bride as a man say they are
[1:27:28] the mercy seat then she is the mediator
[1:27:30] or she is the mediator so what heaven it
[1:27:35] or what Testament is he the mediator of
[1:27:41] so what is this new a recently developed
[1:27:47] covenant if the bride is now the
[1:27:49] mediator because she would have to have
[1:27:53] a new covenant so now we don't have an
[1:27:57] Old Covenant in a new covenant but now
[1:28:00] we got the new New Covenant the third
[1:28:02] covenant the only thing that makes the
[1:28:06] mercy seat not a judgement seat is that
[1:28:08] there's blood on it
[1:28:09] atoning so where then where then does
[1:28:15] the bride have blood to offer the blood
[1:28:18] of a thousand saints can save us the
[1:28:23] blood of a million bride members cannot
[1:28:27] save us
[1:28:28] in fact the blood of every human that's
[1:28:31] ever been born except for Jesus Christ
[1:28:34] will not save you
[1:28:37] there's only one blonde by which we're
[1:28:40] saved we are saved by the blood of
[1:28:43] Christ
[1:28:44] we have forgiveness of sin through his
[1:28:48] blood now so again so who is worthy it
[1:28:53] would take somebody worthy
[1:28:55] well so what preacher is worthy and what
[1:28:58] group that names a sub bride is so
[1:29:01] worthy they can take us away our sins
[1:29:03] and I'm going to come tell you right now
[1:29:05] I don't even want their righteousness
[1:29:08] [Music]
[1:29:10] amen but this one this one he becomes
[1:29:13] our sin and he gives us his
[1:29:15] righteousness the others they the day
[1:29:20] they may claim to take away our sin but
[1:29:23] they but again they cannot give us
[1:29:26] righteousness because only righteousness
[1:29:30] comes from Jesus himself and man Jesus
[1:29:34] alone is our approach to God remember
[1:29:39] the book is in the hands of one no man
[1:29:42] is worthy until the one on the throne
[1:29:44] becomes the land it is wrote
[1:29:47] symbolically as a lamb so we're not
[1:29:49] confused with two persons of the Godhead
[1:29:51] but rather this is symbolic of his work
[1:29:55] that he is doing of redeeming now so
[1:29:58] again Jesus alone is approach to God go
[1:30:01] with me to John 14 and 6 jesus said unto
[1:30:04] him I am the way the truth and the life
[1:30:08] and no man cometh unto the father but by
[1:30:11] me
[1:30:12] so therefore nobody else sees he
[1:30:15] approach to God only through Jesus
[1:30:18] somebody with me now
[1:30:20] Amen Muslims cannot to bring you
[1:30:23] approach to God Buddha cannot bring in
[1:30:26] approach to God and may even the Jews
[1:30:29] cannot bring you an approach to God with
[1:30:33] all their forms and religious rituals
[1:30:36] and everything else they cannot bring
[1:30:38] you to God there is only one that can
[1:30:42] bring you to God and that Jesus Christ
[1:30:45] and he is the way he is the truth he is
[1:30:48] the life and no man comes to the Father
[1:30:50] except by him he is the only approach to
[1:30:55] God he would leave the throne to make an
[1:30:58] approach back to him when we could not
[1:31:02] go into heaven because of our sins then
[1:31:05] heaven came down to us hallelujah
[1:31:11] now if you go with me to Ephesians 1 so
[1:31:15] I don't have this verse here but in whom
[1:31:17] we have redemption through his blood the
[1:31:19] forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:31:22] riches of His grace
[1:31:23] a man so Jesus makes it clear he's the
[1:31:27] only approach to God so how can a group
[1:31:31] of sainted believers sinners like all
[1:31:34] mankind be the life that men comes to
[1:31:38] God by how can the bride be the way that
[1:31:42] sinners come by how can she be the truth
[1:31:46] that sinners are saved by now I'm asking
[1:31:50] this how can she do it alone without
[1:31:55] Jesus it is only through Christ we can
[1:32:01] offer salvation it is only through
[1:32:05] Christ we can remit sins it is only
[1:32:09] through Christ we can heal diseases
[1:32:12] there's not any power in any of us on
[1:32:15] our own to heal diseases amen but there
[1:32:19] is redemption in his blood there is
[1:32:22] healing in his blood there is power in
[1:32:26] his life by man so again I'll conceive
[1:32:30] me the truth that sinners are saved by
[1:32:33] it's not her truth is his truth so how
[1:32:37] can we do away with his meat authorial
[1:32:39] ship and man become the mediator we
[1:32:42] can't do it there's only one mediator
[1:32:45] between God and man that's the man
[1:32:48] Christ Jesus a man the bride is the
[1:32:52] truth by being given the truth she is
[1:32:55] life by being give
[1:32:57] life a man she is the way by being given
[1:33:03] the way but without Jesus she is not the
[1:33:06] way she is be rest she is but a corpse
[1:33:10] she is just a useless thing a prostitute
[1:33:13] like the rest of the systems on
[1:33:15] Nicolaitans spirit come on
[1:33:18] remember with Jesus with Christ sin
[1:33:20] Hermits
[1:33:21] a man then there is redemption to his
[1:33:24] blood there is forgiveness of sin then
[1:33:27] his mercy and there is grace hallelujah
[1:33:31] a man and back to the matter is she only
[1:33:35] points to the way she's not the way
[1:33:37] Christ is a man and so again she
[1:33:41] receives his way his truth and his life
[1:33:44] it's all of Jesus hey man now I'd like
[1:33:49] you to turn with me to Romans 8 and 38
[1:33:52] for I am persuaded that neither death
[1:33:56] nor life nor Angels nor principalities
[1:33:59] nor powers nor things present nor things
[1:34:03] to come nor height nor depth nor any
[1:34:07] other creature shall be able to separate
[1:34:10] us from the love of God which is in
[1:34:12] Christ Jesus our Lord
[1:34:16] hi ma'am now how wonderful is this
[1:34:20] nothing can separate you from him but
[1:34:24] I'll tell you you just leave some of
[1:34:25] these preachers assembly or their church
[1:34:27] group that they called the bride and you
[1:34:29] find out how quick right quickly you're
[1:34:32] damned and going to hell told you can
[1:34:33] never make the rapture without belonging
[1:34:35] to them because you know just a little
[1:34:38] disagreement will separate you from
[1:34:40] their love you find you fall out of
[1:34:46] favor real quick with man you can find
[1:34:51] out you can even find fall out of favor
[1:34:54] with me but you can't fall out of favor
[1:34:58] with him
[1:35:01] come on a man no man can put you out and
[1:35:06] no man can save you and put you in so no
[1:35:11] man can make your bride and no man can
[1:35:13] put you out of the bride salvation is
[1:35:16] totally of the Lord it's not a man mile
[1:35:19] all so you don't have to walk on
[1:35:24] eggshells wondering what day you're
[1:35:26] gonna make brother Jim mad and he's
[1:35:28] gonna put you out the bride cuz he don't
[1:35:30] have the power to put you out of the
[1:35:32] bride and no other preachers got the
[1:35:35] power to put you out of the bride only
[1:35:38] God called you and he elected you and he
[1:35:41] chose you and before the foundation of
[1:35:43] the world and what's more he can't
[1:35:45] change his mind about him hallelujah
[1:35:52] man you will never fall out of his favor
[1:35:55] you'll never fall out of his grace
[1:35:57] you'll never do anything to separate you
[1:36:00] from his love his love for each bring it
[1:36:02] down his graceful reach downward man can
[1:36:05] offering his mercy will endure forever
[1:36:08] because he's a God that is rich in
[1:36:11] Nursing
[1:36:12] I remember seeing you run out of mercy
[1:36:15] and man run out of mercy and court
[1:36:18] system run out of mercy but God never
[1:36:20] runs out of mercy his mercy endures
[1:36:23] forever he'll never run out of mercy for
[1:36:32] one of his own God's children play some
[1:36:38] worship brother Branham says they say
[1:36:41] today I heard people tell me a man
[1:36:44] called me not long ago in Beaumont Texas
[1:36:47] he said mr. Branum if your name is not
[1:36:51] on our church book you can't go to
[1:36:52] heaven would you ever think of that
[1:36:56] don't you believe such a thing as that
[1:37:00] they think you have to belong to that
[1:37:02] certain church so you cannot go to
[1:37:04] heaven that's wrong to believe that is
[1:37:08] Antichrist and I'll say this if you
[1:37:10] believe such a spirit you're lost that's
[1:37:13] a good sign you're lost because it's
[1:37:15] taking away from what God did you see
[1:37:21] it's lost people who want to remove
[1:37:24] Christ mediatorial ship and put it on a
[1:37:28] group any man God never put his name in
[1:37:35] any Church I'm finishing the quote he
[1:37:38] put it in his son Christ Jesus when he
[1:37:41] and his son became one that's the
[1:37:43] genuine place of worship no other
[1:37:45] foundations was laid no other rock now I
[1:37:50] wonder if some self-described group who
[1:37:54] calls herself the bride how easy it
[1:37:58] would be to separate yourself from her
[1:38:02] love the moment you disagree with a
[1:38:05] little Pope of that group you'll be
[1:38:08] separating ostracized and put out of the
[1:38:11] group but look at Romans 8 and verse 27
[1:38:18] the Bible said him he searches he that
[1:38:21] searches the hearts knoweth what is the
[1:38:24] mind of the Spirit
[1:38:26] because he maketh intercession for the
[1:38:29] saints according to the will of God so
[1:38:33] he he makes intercession the spirit
[1:38:38] makes intercession now so who who else
[1:38:42] can search the heart but Jesus and who
[1:38:47] else is the Holy Spirit but the spirit
[1:38:50] of Jesus a man and who can know the mind
[1:38:54] of the Spirit but Jesus a man so if a
[1:38:59] group is Ammar is the mercy seat then
[1:39:03] she makes intercession according to the
[1:39:06] whim of some preacher this is as cultish
[1:39:10] as cultish can be anything that would
[1:39:15] take away from Jesus Christ but there's
[1:39:21] something a deed his spirit in this
[1:39:23] message that wants to remove the deity
[1:39:25] from Jesus and put the deity on a man or
[1:39:30] some other little group Hebrews 8 and 6
[1:39:35] but now has he obtained a more excellent
[1:39:38] ministry by how much also he is the
[1:39:43] mediator of a better covenant which was
[1:39:46] established upon better promises
[1:39:49] so again if some group is the mercy see
[1:39:54] what better covenant is she extended
[1:39:58] mercy by in fact I just want to ask you
[1:40:01] what better covenant do we need what can
[1:40:07] somebody offer me that Jesus hadn't
[1:40:09] already offered what greater salvation
[1:40:14] can somebody offer me than Jesus offered
[1:40:17] what greater healing Kinjo can be
[1:40:20] offered that what Jesus offers amen so
[1:40:25] what better promises could she give than
[1:40:28] Jesus gave the Bible said in 2nd
[1:40:32] Corinthians 5:21 for he had made him to
[1:40:35] be sin for us who knew no sin he was
[1:40:39] sinless one but he became sin that we
[1:40:42] might be made the righteousness of God
[1:40:44] in him so in order to be the mercy seat
[1:40:47] Jesus had to be made sin for us
[1:40:51] churches are groups who claim the power
[1:40:54] to remit sin they in order to do that
[1:40:59] they will have to die and become sin and
[1:41:02] die and pay the penalty of sin and I'm
[1:41:06] just gonna say I don't need him because
[1:41:08] mine has already been paid a man for the
[1:41:13] bride to be the mercy seat then she has
[1:41:16] to be the perpetuation she has to be
[1:41:19] able to turn away God's anger to be the
[1:41:22] mercy seat she has to be the giver of
[1:41:24] blood because that's what Christ had to
[1:41:27] do to be the mercy seat was give his own
[1:41:30] blood the blood is a set of all the
[1:41:34] every member of every bride member that
[1:41:37] way if it could all be said of the whole
[1:41:38] world could not save not one sinner
[1:41:41] there's no power in her blood there is
[1:41:45] only power in his blood there is no
[1:41:48] salvation and her name hallelujah I mean
[1:41:54] you can belong to evening like
[1:41:56] tabernacle as long as you're have breath
[1:41:59] in your life but it won't save you you
[1:42:03] can never miss a service but it won't
[1:42:05] save you there is no salvation in our
[1:42:09] name or the name of a local assembly
[1:42:13] there's only salvation in his name it is
[1:42:17] him you have to belong to you can belong
[1:42:20] to this church and still split hell wide
[1:42:22] open
[1:42:23] [Applause]
[1:42:25] Amen but if you belong to Jesus the
[1:42:28] rapture is yours the Millenium is yours
[1:42:31] the new heaven and earth is yours
[1:42:33] everything God has is yours because you
[1:42:36] are a receiving heir
[1:42:39] from him hallelujah
[1:42:42] his name is the only name given among
[1:42:45] heaven whereby men must be saved brother
[1:42:51] Branham told us in God's chosen place of
[1:42:53] worship he never said anything about a
[1:42:55] sheep he said him in fact he talks about
[1:43:00] that he said notice it was not a sea
[1:43:02] lamb
[1:43:03] it was a he lamb he said it's never her
[1:43:07] it is him
[1:43:09] a man him is the meeting place the lamb
[1:43:13] not the church not her name but his name
[1:43:16] he didn't put her name anywhere he put
[1:43:19] his name in him that's why all we do
[1:43:23] must do in word or deed we must do it
[1:43:27] all in the name of Jesus Christ if we
[1:43:30] pray we got to pray in the name of Jesus
[1:43:33] if we petition we got a petition or ask
[1:43:36] in the name of Jesus name if we walk we
[1:43:39] walk in Jesus name if we talk we talk in
[1:43:42] Jesus name if we baptized we got to
[1:43:44] baptize in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:43:47] all that we do in word or deed do it in
[1:43:50] the name of Jesus Christ again
[1:43:54] same message God's chosen place of
[1:43:56] worship he says death cannot strike
[1:44:00] where this provided place of God is and
[1:44:03] that's in the lamb note is this only in
[1:44:07] the lamb is where death can strike so
[1:44:10] while they eat lamb the Lord then you
[1:44:12] ain't got a heart to safety there's only
[1:44:15] one place where their safety and that's
[1:44:19] in the lion a man notice he was
[1:44:23] forbidden Asst he he wasn't he was
[1:44:27] forbidden Asst - he was forbidden to
[1:44:30] strike on Israel or the Hebrew priest or
[1:44:34] any of their denomination all must be in
[1:44:36] God's chosen provided place or death
[1:44:40] struck church wherever you are whatever
[1:44:43] you belong to makes me no difference but
[1:44:47] there's one thing you must know
[1:44:49] you've got to be in Christ or your debt
[1:44:54] you can't live outside of him your
[1:44:58] church might be alright as a building
[1:45:00] your fellowship might be alright as man
[1:45:04] but when you deny the body the blood or
[1:45:07] the word of Jesus Christ you're dead the
[1:45:10] miniature do it it's God's chosen place
[1:45:12] of worship that's where his name is
[1:45:14] exactly that's where he chose him but
[1:45:17] his name not in the church but in the
[1:45:20] son Jesus Christ hey man now of course
[1:45:26] you know men's mind is a begin to work
[1:45:29] in contemplating they begin to pose
[1:45:32] questions like well then but we're
[1:45:35] justified we never did it in the first
[1:45:38] place so we don't need an attorney
[1:45:42] we've been declared righteous and
[1:45:45] justified we no longer need an
[1:45:47] intercessor we don't need even a mercy
[1:45:50] seat in this age we've been declared
[1:45:52] righteous that we are the pure sinless
[1:45:56] virtuous bride of Jesus Christ we never
[1:46:01] did it in the first place the case is
[1:46:04] dismissed for the tenth so we don't need
[1:46:07] an attorney you know you know why don't
[1:46:12] you know what the Prophet said brother
[1:46:14] Branham said this we are perfectly the
[1:46:17] case is dismissed there's no more sin to
[1:46:21] the believer Oh God have mercy if people
[1:46:24] can't see that there's no more case he
[1:46:26] that was heareth my word believeth on
[1:46:29] him that sent me has eternal life and
[1:46:31] shall not come into the judgment but
[1:46:34] it's passed from death to the life
[1:46:36] there's the case case is dismissed
[1:46:39] no more case to it a man and I say amen
[1:46:44] to that and and of course you know the
[1:46:48] case is dismissed
[1:46:50] but here's half
[1:46:54] hey man you said what we don't need a
[1:46:56] mediator because my case has been
[1:46:58] dismissed we don't need a minute says we
[1:47:00] don't need an attorney no more we're
[1:47:02] beyond all of that we don't need that
[1:47:04] well listen here's how on the wings of
[1:47:07] us no I dove happen to be present when
[1:47:09] brother Brandon preached this one he
[1:47:11] said did you know a real Christian
[1:47:13] doesn't have any sin at all imputed to
[1:47:16] him David said blessed is the man who
[1:47:20] God will not impute sin to when you're
[1:47:23] washing the blood of the Lamb
[1:47:25] not by make-believe but really the blood
[1:47:27] of the Lamb God does not impute to you
[1:47:31] anything that's done because you're
[1:47:34] under the blood and he doesn't see it
[1:47:38] there is a blood sacrifice the only
[1:47:44] thing he can see you in is the way he
[1:47:48] saw you before the foundation of the
[1:47:51] world when he put your name on the
[1:47:54] Lamb's Book of Life that's all he can
[1:47:57] look at because you're redeemed from
[1:47:59] everything else that was done and you're
[1:48:01] washed in the blood of the Lamb so the
[1:48:04] case is dismissed because I'm under the
[1:48:08] blood man the case is dismissed because
[1:48:13] I got a mercy seat the case is dismissed
[1:48:16] because Jesus is my sacrifice hey man
[1:48:20] and what was against me is dismissed
[1:48:22] because he paid the price and the only
[1:48:26] way God can see me now is the way he had
[1:48:29] me in his mind before sin ever entered
[1:48:32] the picture hallelujah because Jesus
[1:48:36] hallelujah I turn it did away with the
[1:48:40] evidence that was against us hallelujah
[1:48:43] he didn't do it by crookedness he did it
[1:48:46] as a legal attorney and he did it by
[1:48:49] paying the price himself
[1:48:53] I say what an attorney I say what am i
[1:48:57] turning a man we don't we we were
[1:49:01] criminals if you're a criminal in our
[1:49:03] court you're not gonna get some attorney
[1:49:06] to take your place hey man you're not
[1:49:10] gonna get some attorney to pay your fine
[1:49:13] you'll find millions of dollars he's not
[1:49:16] gonna pay it you'll pay it or you go to
[1:49:19] jail hey man and we would have went to
[1:49:22] hell because it wasn't none of these
[1:49:26] self-made wannabe attorneys in religion
[1:49:30] that could pay I sit down there was no
[1:49:33] church group could be a mercy seat and
[1:49:35] paid the debt against us but I Got News
[1:49:40] for You Jesus did hallelujah and what he
[1:49:46] did is he not only did that but he had
[1:49:48] sponge so the evidence that was against
[1:49:50] you cuz he hallelujah he didn't just
[1:49:55] coverton but he acknowledged it by the
[1:49:57] blood and said you never did it in the
[1:50:00] first place well I see you now is what
[1:50:03] you were if my mind before the world
[1:50:06] began that's how I see you now and
[1:50:08] that's how I always see you when you
[1:50:11] pray that's the way that let us see you
[1:50:13] you might have made a mistake you matter
[1:50:16] you might have had some doubt or
[1:50:17] unbelief
[1:50:18] you might iron some nonsense you know
[1:50:21] that you shouldn't have said that no
[1:50:23] maybe I'm not healed maybe I didn't do
[1:50:25] right maybe I maybe I'm not just you you
[1:50:28] could've met you can set any kind of
[1:50:30] nonsense five minutes ago and dip it in
[1:50:35] the blood and he doesn't see what you
[1:50:38] did five minutes ago
[1:50:44] hallelujah
[1:50:45] everybody sees you the way you were in
[1:50:49] his mind before the foundation of the
[1:50:52] world
[1:50:53] his brother dilates in it knowledge the
[1:50:57] guilt it knowledge the same there's no
[1:51:00] saving me Amen honey believers this
[1:51:05] morning and say there's no shame on me
[1:51:07] he took my safe he took my penalty
[1:51:10] he took my sin and there's no save on me
[1:51:16] he became me
[1:51:24] brother Brandon said therefore there's
[1:51:27] no call in you there's no unclean habit
[1:51:31] in you because that the blood of the
[1:51:34] Lamb that Dez did this and God cannot
[1:51:37] impute sin to you after you've got a sin
[1:51:40] offer and laying there waiting for you
[1:51:43] what you say well that gives me plenty
[1:51:45] of room brother branham I can do what I
[1:51:47] want to you said I always do I mean I'm
[1:51:51] talking to a group of people to smoke
[1:51:53] all I won't drink all the won't lust all
[1:51:55] they won't
[1:51:55] what's pornography all they won't come
[1:52:00] on why because the work too has been
[1:52:03] changed the desire of sin has gone
[1:52:06] hallelujah and I got plenty room to do
[1:52:09] what I want to what I want to do I want
[1:52:12] to serve Him I want to love him I want
[1:52:14] to keep his Commandments I want to be
[1:52:16] true to him hey man I want to be in
[1:52:19] fellowship with him that's what I want
[1:52:21] to do
[1:52:23] halleluyah gives me plenty around a
[1:52:27] mount but when a man can really see what
[1:52:31] Jesus done for him and turn around and
[1:52:35] do something contrary to him it shows he
[1:52:37] never received Christ you ever receive
[1:52:40] him once a man sin is finished you don't
[1:52:45] want anymore hey man so this is why God
[1:52:49] can only see us like we were before the
[1:52:52] foundation of the world is because he is
[1:52:56] our mercy seat he is our comforter he is
[1:53:01] our advocate
[1:53:03] he is our propitiation he is our
[1:53:06] sacrifice and his sin clintus and his
[1:53:10] blood cleanses us from all sin Alleluia
[1:53:15] so that means the Covenant is yours the
[1:53:18] land is yours the book is yours hey man
[1:53:24] the Covenant is the deed do it in the
[1:53:26] enemy that possesses is claims here must
[1:53:29] be struck off a mound so here we are as
[1:53:35] believers here's what we stand we have a
[1:53:38] mercy seat and Christ is that seat of
[1:53:42] mercy
[1:53:43] he is that approach to God you cannot
[1:53:46] approach him through a church you must
[1:53:49] approach it to the man Christ Jesus
[1:53:52] hallelujah a man and then when you find
[1:53:56] that worthy man and he takes your place
[1:53:59] as a man remember it was man that lost
[1:54:02] it and he was not taking the book as God
[1:54:07] it did not look for a God that was
[1:54:11] worthy I mean when the sound went out it
[1:54:15] didn't say is it is there a God worthy
[1:54:18] is that is there man worthy there has to
[1:54:23] be a man worthy now once that man takes
[1:54:30] it God becomes a man to take for us what
[1:54:33] we couldn't Hey
[1:54:35] to pay the debt what we couldn't pay
[1:54:38] somebody with me now a man now then as
[1:54:41] God does this and takes on the sins of
[1:54:45] man then he takes the book in his hands
[1:54:48] and he loses the seals I want you to
[1:54:53] know he doesn't give you the book which
[1:54:55] still claims against it he doesn't give
[1:54:59] you the buff and they're still seals
[1:55:01] that are unopened that you're not worthy
[1:55:03] to open because it will take a lama to
[1:55:08] take the book and to open the seals not
[1:55:12] just take the belt but to open the seals
[1:55:14] nobody nobody else could do it but the
[1:55:17] worthy man now I want to get into you
[1:55:20] because it is God as a man taking man's
[1:55:26] place and winning back the title that
[1:55:30] was lost for man not so he can go back
[1:55:35] to sit back on the throne with it no he
[1:55:42] didn't want it for herself he had it is
[1:55:44] gone look in the Bible I mean there was
[1:55:48] one sitting on the drowning as God he
[1:55:50] has the book but it's a man that needs
[1:55:54] the book but man is sand and gain take
[1:55:57] the book so God becomes a man and takes
[1:56:00] the book and then God opens a man this
[1:56:03] man as God as man tastes the book and
[1:56:06] opens the seals and as he does oh
[1:56:10] brother
[1:56:11] he doesn't leave it in the heavens he
[1:56:14] rips it off and he hands it down to the
[1:56:16] seventh angel on earth
[1:56:18] I meant to reveal the mystery to the
[1:56:21] entire church so that you would know
[1:56:24] your debt has been paid
[1:56:27] and the sin-debt of the ages have been
[1:56:30] paid and the glass that have been there
[1:56:33] the death you couldn't go in director
[1:56:35] with the false baptism you couldn't take
[1:56:38] come on I'm talking about alive and
[1:56:40] remain at the coming of the Lord
[1:56:42] a Boreas church without spot or wrinkle
[1:56:44] you couldn't go and take a rapture and
[1:56:47] be the alive and remain would send that
[1:56:49] on you loser couldn't take it
[1:56:52] Wesley couldn't do it and they couldn't
[1:56:55] have a resurrection in a rapture in
[1:56:58] their age but hallelujah in this day in
[1:57:01] this time o God has made it possible to
[1:57:04] take the seals off the book and ever
[1:57:07] claim that's been against the church you
[1:57:10] had baptism wrong you've had you had the
[1:57:13] Godhead wrong you had the original sin
[1:57:16] wrong you had predestination wrong you
[1:57:19] had all the marriage and divorce you had
[1:57:21] it all wrong hallelujah but I'm not
[1:57:26] gonna leave you in that condition with
[1:57:28] depth on the church you can't go in the
[1:57:31] rapture with the debt I've got to pay
[1:57:34] the price of redemption and I've got to
[1:57:36] take the blood and apply it there and
[1:57:39] get rid of the sin debt the false
[1:57:44] doctrines and has kept the book closed
[1:57:46] to the believer because when I handed to
[1:57:50] them it's going to be an open book
[1:57:55] hallelujah now let's read revelation 10
[1:57:59] 8 and here we are here's the book that
[1:58:06] John couldn't even look on that he
[1:58:09] wasn't worthy to take now John
[1:58:11] represents in the symbols here he
[1:58:15] represents the church so now he hears a
[1:58:20] voice from heaven notice if we would go
[1:58:24] back to Revelation 10 one you would see
[1:58:26] my angel come down and his description
[1:58:30] verse 2 and they had in his hand a
[1:58:33] little book what open so the book now
[1:58:39] that was close
[1:58:40] is now open and an anointing is coming
[1:58:44] down now this is not the physical return
[1:58:49] this is not a 900 foot tall Jesus
[1:58:53] putting his foot on the land and on the
[1:58:55] sea this is this here is represented as
[1:58:59] an angel of the Covenant where God
[1:59:02] becomes his own his own messenger or
[1:59:07] angel of the cabinet and here he comes
[1:59:10] down now and he's got a book and it's
[1:59:13] all back
[1:59:16] Alleluia he puts his feet on land and on
[1:59:19] the sea and all the powers there of the
[1:59:23] cub what's in the sea multitudes nations
[1:59:25] kindred tongues and people that's what
[1:59:27] sea means in the Bible though many
[1:59:30] waters and then upon the land were that
[1:59:32] there was not many people right here in
[1:59:34] America it puts there his foot on the
[1:59:36] land and on the sea a man his feet are
[1:59:40] as pillars of fire amen Holy Ghost
[1:59:44] filled individuals his body notice it
[1:59:48] only shows his head when and when it's
[1:59:50] displayed in the in disguise and and the
[1:59:53] sign comes it's only his head there's no
[1:59:55] body
[1:59:55] where's his body it's on the earth and
[1:59:58] you are his feet right here overcoming
[2:00:02] Satan right here in his this evil age
[2:00:05] put your feet come on Joshua and I never
[2:00:09] wear that the soles of your feet tread
[2:00:12] that I have given to you footsteps mean
[2:00:15] possession I give you possession over
[2:00:18] ever spirit whether it comes out of the
[2:00:21] land or on the sea ever spirit upon the
[2:00:23] earth I give you possession and
[2:00:26] authority and power over it a man in a
[2:00:30] kennel act it cannot break loose and
[2:00:32] hell cannot break loose until those feet
[2:00:35] is the earth and a brad goes
[2:00:37] NACHA then all hell breaks loose on the
[2:00:41] earth but as long as you are here hell
[2:00:43] cannot break loose the tribulation
[2:00:46] cannot come
[2:00:48] the plans cannot all come we may be
[2:00:51] seeing pre-tribulation plagues but them
[2:00:53] true plans of the tribulation cannot
[2:00:55] come until a bride is raptured and when
[2:00:58] she's raptured then Satan comes down and
[2:01:02] he becomes a king and he possesses the
[2:01:05] nation's but now notice he has in his
[2:01:11] hand a little book and it's open go back
[2:01:14] to verse 8 and the voice which I heard
[2:01:19] from heaven spake unto me again and he
[2:01:24] said go and take the little book which
[2:01:30] is open in the hand of the angel which
[2:01:32] tended upon the sea and the earth notice
[2:01:36] how perfect this is now you go take the
[2:01:39] book you a man no man was worthy John
[2:01:45] said I wasn't worthy to even look on it
[2:01:48] much less to loose the seals or to take
[2:01:51] it but now after it's been done through
[2:01:55] the mediator you say mediatorial ship is
[2:01:58] over with well then who is this mediator
[2:02:01] coming down the women open book and
[2:02:05] mediating between God and man and
[2:02:07] bringing it down to man again it is a
[2:02:14] mediator a man and he comes down now the
[2:02:18] mighty angel as a messenger of his own
[2:02:22] covenant he comes and he reveals herself
[2:02:24] to the seventh angel on earth revelation
[2:02:27] 10 7 that's where he reveals herself in
[2:02:30] the days of the voice of the seventh
[2:02:32] angel he reveals himself so the mystery
[2:02:35] of God would be finished but then in
[2:02:38] verse eight I want you to understand
[2:02:40] that comes a transfer of the title from
[2:02:44] from Christ to man again
[2:02:47] now let me tell you what it's a title
[2:02:50] for it is a title to your new body now
[2:02:56] really you're not really that concerned
[2:02:57] about going out here and moving this
[2:02:59] tree and all of that

[2:03:05] body change that's really where I want
[2:03:09] the earth to move I mean this is where I
[2:03:12] want the trees to move around this is a
[2:03:14] garden
