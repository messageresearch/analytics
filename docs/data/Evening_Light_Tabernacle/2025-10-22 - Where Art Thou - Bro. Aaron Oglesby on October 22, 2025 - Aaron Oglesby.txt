God, give us hearts that turn quickly to you, casting aside any idol, anything that we've let come close to us that would interfere our worship. Lord, as we bow our hearts and slip a hand up to you this evening, would you, Lord, as we reach out to you, would you reach back tonight, Lord? Even maybe if you're not looking our way, we could reach out and touch the hem of your garment. Something that's been troubling us for years would God, it would just be taken away in a moment. Lord, we'd realize that in your presence, we're clean. In your presence, Lord, you've made us holy. Lord, there's been sacrifices made [Music] just to be in your house tonight. There's people that have struggled today, but they've made it. They're asking you, maybe like Samson, they've placed their hands on the pillars. They can't see their way out, but they're saying, "Once more, Lord, would your presence come this evening? Lord, not only here but maybe in an airport or an airplane somewhere between here in Europe as our pastor. He's looking to you for a word to speak to a group of people that he's not around every day. Maybe not the sheep of his pasture, but they're your sheep, Lord. Give him words to speak and be with our brother Timothy, Lord, as he travels. Give him comfort, Lord, and peace in his heart. Put words in his mouth, Father. Lord, as brother Aaron comes this evening, Lord, may we not look at a man, though we love the man of God, but may we look beyond the badger skin this evening, Lord, and pull from the holiest of holies what our need is, what the cry of our heart is, Lord. Maybe one needs to know you more. Maybe one's holding up a cup and saying, "God, just give me a drink." Maybe one's hungry this evening and they're asking for the bread of life to come and fill their hungry soul. Lord, we're all at different stages in different degrees, but we're all on that narrow path. Lord, we want to make it to heaven. We want to sit in your throne, Lord, in a place where you've called us to be. So Lord, don't let our we don't want to get our eyes so focused on the future that we fail in the present. But Lord, help us to worship you in spirit and in truth this evening. Those that have come with needs and burdens, Lord, you're the burden bearer. Lift their needs this evening, we pray, committing this service to you and the specials that'll be sung. We love you tonight. Maybe you just want to express that from your heart just for a moment. How we love you, Lord. Lord, allow us to be worshippers. True worshippers, Lord. Could set aside our own feelings and set aside our own doubts and our own misunderstandings and realize that you're the great King of glory that has desired that we would come and gather in your house of worship this evening and worship you in spirit and in truth. We love you Lord. [Music] Hallelujah. Give F. [Music] I'm coming back to the heart of worship. Just start playing that if you could. Amen. The brothers wouldn't mind receiving the offering this evening. Give us unto the Lord is he's given to you. [Music] Amen. Brother Sam and the girls have a special tonight. So if they can get ready, we'll just sing a little bit of this. When the music fades, all is stripped away. And I simply come, [Music] longing just to bring something that's of worth that will bless your heart. I'll bring you more. I'll bring you more than a song. Cuz the song in itself is not what you have required. Can you change the verse? You search much deeper within way things appear. You're looking into my heart. I'm coming back. &gt;&gt; And it's all about you. &gt;&gt; It's all about you, Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the things I've made it. It's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. King of endless world. No one could express how much you deserve. [Music] Though I'm weak and cold, all I have is yours. Every single breath. [Music] I'll bring you more than a song. for a song in itself is not what you have required. He's searching. You search much deeper within through the way things are. You're looking into my heart. I'm coming back. to the heart of worship where it's all about you Lord. It's all about you Jesus [Music] where it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. I'm coming back to the heart of worship. It's all about you. [Music] It's all about you, Jesus. I'm sorry for the things I waited. And it's all about you. &gt;&gt; It's all about you, Jesus. God bless you tonight. [Music] Well, Abraham prayed for the day [Music] God would give him a son. Blessed Isaac was his name. The greatest gift he'd ever known that came the day. Who would have dreamed? God would say, "You got to give him back to me." And on this mountain, you must prove that it's you and Isaac. For it's me and you. When I lay my eyes down &gt;&gt; with a broken heart, but my father's round [Music] and on this where he lay just to find that it wasn't him. God wanted me. Now most of us, I dare to say we've got an Isa [Music] standing in God's way. But it's on this altar you too can prove that it's not your Isaac that God wants. He wants you. When I lay my eyes down with a broken heart, but my father's proud and on this where he lay just to find that it wasn't him. God one with me. [Music] &gt;&gt; All to Jesus I surrender all to him I freely give. I will ever love and I'll trust him in his presence daily live. I surrender all. I surrender all [Music] to thee my blessed savior I surrender. [Music] When I lay my eyes down with a broken heart, but my father's crown and on this altar where he lay just to find that it wasn't you God wanted me on this altar where he lay just to find that it wasn't him. God won't be me. [Music] Amen. Why don't we stand together this evening? Key of G, if you could, as we invite Brother Aaron to come tonight. I give myself away. [Music] I give myself away so you can use me. I give myself away. [Music] I give myself away so you can use me. Here I am. Here I say all my life is in your hand. Lord I want [Music] to see your desire in me. I give myself away. [Music] I give myself away so you can use me. I give myself away. I give myself away so you can use. Lord, take my heart. Take my life as a livinging sacrifice. All I dream. All my plans, Lord, I place them in your hands. I give myself away. [Music] I give myself away so you can use me. I give myself away. [Applause] I give myself away. So you can use my life is not my own. To you I belong. Hallelujah. Oh my life is not my own. To you I belong. I give myself I give myself to you. I give myself away. [Music] I give myself away so you can use me. I give myself away. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I give myself away. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many's willing to do that tonight? to just give yourself away to his will and his purpose so that you can be used. Amen. Let's pray together. Father, Lord, how grateful we are for this opportunity, Lord, to be in your presence, Lord, another opportunity to gather, Lord. I pray we not take it for granted, but may we just, Lord, use every moment of it, Lord, to glorify you, draw closer to you, Lord. May we lock in just now and allow you to speak, Father. Lord, I recognize my own inabilities, Lord. And Lord, have nothing that I could say or do that would benefit your people. But Father, if I can step aside tonight and allow you to speak, Lord, I believe tonight, Lord, that we can be blessed in your presence and touched by your word. And Lord, may your word take its effect tonight, we pray. Father, Lord, I pray you'll be with Brother Joe, Brother Tim, Brother Timothy, Lord, as they're out tonight, Lord, use them for your glory. I pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you this evening. It's good to be in the house of God. And if you have your Bibles and you'd like to turn with me to Genesis 3 and verse 7. Genesis 3 and verse 7. And Amen. I appreciate your prayers. I know some of you, you know, I've been dealing with a some things. I have a a surgery scheduled for Tuesday. I have four four stones in my right kidney. One really large one about a half inch that they're going to go in and uh and hopefully take care of. and we're just believing everything's going to go well. Amen. But we're just going to we're here tonight trusting the Lord to give us strength and be with us and and we'll give you all we got tonight. Amen. Amen. If we see here Genesis chapter 3 and verse 7, I want to speak to you on a little a question tonight. Where art thou? Where art thou? The Bible says here, "And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked, and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?" And he said, 'I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself. We also want to read from Matthew chapter 14 verse 22. Matthew 14:22. We're going to read down through verse 31. It says, "And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitudes away. And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray. And when the evening was come, he was there alone. But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves, for the wind was contrary. And in the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went unto them walking on the sea. And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit. And they cried out for fear. But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer. It is I. be not afraid. And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. And he said, Come. And when Peter was come out of the ship, he walked on the water to go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him, "Oh, thou of little faith, wherefore did thou doubt?" Amen. I just pray that the Lord will add his blessing to the reading of the word as you take your seats tonight. Where art thou? Where art thou? As we look at this tonight, I I want us to to recognize that that is an applicable question to your life, regardless of where you're at tonight. It's not a condemnation. It's not an accusation. It's just an opportunity to be honest with yourself and with God. No matter how far we've come in our journey, no matter where you're at on the ladder, how low, how far, how high, we all still have farther to go. And a lot of times in order to recognize where we need to go, we need to recognize where we're at. Where are we as an individual? Even even born again and and sealed with the spirit, there are moments and times in our life that we need to stop. We need to look and we need to listen and and take account and take inventory and answer the question that God asked tonight. Where art thou? Where are you? And it's a call to an honest heart, for an honest moment. Am I allin? Uh is my life lining up? Where am I? Born again and on fire. Born again and in a slump, justified, sanctified. Am I stagnant? A am I walking with the Lord tonight? Do I do I have wrong feelings towards people? Do I have excuses? Am I progressing? A am I am I free tonight? &gt;&gt; Am I free how I'm supposed to be? And I ask it again, where art thou? Where do you find yourself tonight? And and even going beyond the individual as a church tonight, we should take inventory. And what are we producing? Uh what what are we patterning after? Are are we fulfilling the role that God has called us to fulfill at Evening Light Tabernacle? Are are the works of Christ being manifested? Is the new birth being preached? Um are lives being changed? &gt;&gt; Evening Light Tabernacle, where art thou? You know, and it's not my job to preach to the entire message community tonight. I'm here to preach to you. But but I would ask that question worldwide. Where are we? &gt;&gt; Where are we? What what are we doing? And and and if we if we look back before the beginning, before man and even before Eden, there there was God and God dwelt alone. And and I I guess we would say he, Brother Brandon would tell us he wasn't even God then because God is an object of worship. He was just a great eternal spirit. and and at some point he creates the angels that that worship him every day. But but there was more that God wanted to do there. There was attributes of himself that he wanted expressed. Amen. And he wanted manifested and and he begins to create the earth and and eventually he'll he'll create sons and daughters and and he'll place them on that earth so that he could have a relationship with them. &gt;&gt; Amen. God wanted a family. He wanted someone to love him and and someone that loved to be with him and and somebody that he could fellowship with and have relationship with. And the prophet of God would say that the earth was nothing but a complete chaos. &gt;&gt; He says right here, he says, "And then this world was was in that condition. The the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water and the entire picture was changed from a total chaos to a garden of Eden." That is transforming power of God that can take something that's nothing and make something wonderful out of it. God's transforming power. I love that tonight. Don't you? The the the the the transforming power of God that when something looks hopeless or something looks out of control, all it takes is is the transforming power of God to move on that situation tonight. Amen. And the scripture says it was dark and without form and void and and the spirit of God moved and God said, "Let there be." &gt;&gt; And that mass of nothing began to come subject to the word that God spoke. And it moved and and that mass began to come and and move around the sun. And it began to to orbit around the sun. and and out of that chaos comes an Eden because of God's power to transform. And I'm thankful for all that tonight. I I I marvel at the power of creation and and the creation story. And and it's amazing that that God did that and he created the earth and he brought the chaos into a perfect Eden and earth. But I'm also thankful tonight that it's that his transforming power wasn't all just for for this earth, but it was for this earth right here. It was It was for this chaos right here. It was for this trouble that was going on right here. God's power to transform works in this earth tonight. Amen. Amen. This mess, no matter how messed up it is and how out of control it seems, it doesn't matter how dark, it doesn't matter how far it's wandered. What we need is for the same thing that happened there in Genesis. We need the spirit of God to move tonight. And one moment in his presence, one moment in your situation can take all of that chaos and produce an Eden out of it in just that amount of time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we would just yield our thinking and and yield our hurts and and let go and let God begin to move off across the face of our lives tonight. Let him move tonight because when God moves, things don't stay the same. When God moves, things take place. When God moves, things happen and he can restore order and he can bring deliverance and he can bring the peace that your heart desires. Wherever you're at tonight, what do I need, brother? You need God to move in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he can bring you in in into an Eden again where you have fellowship with God. You mean Eden, brother Aaron? Everything's going to be perfect. No, no, no. I don't mean that. But an Eden condition where you and God once again can have fellowship. An Eden condition where you and God can walk together in the cool of the heen evening and and you can love him and he can love you and there's nothing between you and your God. That's an Eden condition tonight. &gt;&gt; Once again in relationship with God where he comes down and walks with you where where you share your heart and he shares his love and wisdom and leadership. That's what made it Eden. It was God's presence that made it Eden. It was the fact that he was there and the presence of God and the ability to fellowship with him. He says in the beginning when God made the man to worship him and live, God taken care of him and fed him. Man had a perfect fellowship with God. There was nothing wrong. God came down in the evening and talked to Adam and Eve. What a beautiful picture. They was in the presence of the omnipotent powers of God which which held them in control and guided them by his spirit. There was nothing could harm them. Now in the beginning when God come down in the evening and talked to Adam and Eve in the cool of the day, his great voice whispered to them and they had fellowship loved one another. How the moving of the spirit went through the bushes, the lions come up, the tigers, all of them, and they worshiped the Lord. Man was conscious at all times that his presence was with him. &gt;&gt; Conscious at all times. And that's something that was lost down through the ages as the atmosphere has become clogged with demons and and and this world has been given over to Satan's Eden that even though we know and even though we have faith that consciousness that God is always there was robbed away. But notice what he said there. He says they had fellowship. That's what God had longed for all along was that fellowship. Perfect fellowship. That's what he wanted. Someone to love. Someone to walk with and talk with. Someone to share all of this with. Relationship. Listen tonight. This isn't about theology. It isn't about knowing the scriptures better than other people. If that's all you get out of out of your Christian walk, then you've missed it completely. It is about relationship. It's about fellowship. It's about God once again having somebody that he can commune with on a daily basis. &gt;&gt; That was the desire of his heart and that's what he still wants tonight. He He doesn't want you here out of duty even though it is our duty. But that's not the only reason you should be here out of a law. He doesn't want your prayers out of a have to. What kind of relationship is that? What kind of relationship is it really? or a friendship. If if when your friend drops by, you look out the front door and you're like, "Oh, honey, they're here again." Or when they call, you you you answer about every third one and you talk to them because you have to and you try not to get trapped by them after service. What kind of friendship is that &gt;&gt; if you only talk to them because you have no other choice? What kind of relationship is it if your spouse only spoke to you out of a have to? Or what if we spoke to our spouses and each other the way we speak to God sometimes and just make him an errand boy? Think about how much you talk to God. And what is it you say to him? How much time you telling him? How do you spend telling him how wonderful he is, how lovely he is, how mighty he is, how awesome he is, how much you love him. the same way it should be in a spousal relationship. &gt;&gt; But what if we talk to each other the way we talk to him sometimes? Lord, watch over and keep us. Lord, provide for us. Lord, take care of us. I pray you give us traveling mercies. Lord, bless this food. Do this. Do this. Do this. Y'all try that in the morning. Go make me some biscuits. You know how I like my coffee. Go do this. Go do that. What kind of relationship would you have? just take it and not even to be comical and realize sometimes how we speak to God to where everything is Lord do this do this do this instead of taking time to say Lord I'm so thankful I appreciate you so much I love you so much you've been so good to me you've been better to me than what I even deserve Lord Lord you're wonderful you're awesome you're mighty you're the deliverer you're the way maker you're my everything and I just want to come tell you Lord that I love you He wants that relationship and that fellowship. That's why he made in Eden. That's why he wanted sons and daughters. They were on speaking terms with God. And we know how that eventually the serpent came and and he began to twist the word of God. He began to talk to Eve and and bring questions on what God had said. And and young people, old people, everybody listen to me. The serpent always comes with a question. It always starts with a question and it always starts with a twist. But but did he really mean that? Surely that was for a time gone by and well maybe that quote means this and surely a loving God wouldn't do that. And yay hath God said. Listen it once again. It's evening time. This isn't time to be fellowshipping with the ser serpent. It's not time to be arguing with the serpent. It's not the time of day to be constantly feeding on on the things of the tree of knowledge of good and even evil. It's evening time. What's that mean? That's when God has come down once again. This is the time we should be fellowshipping with him more than ever. Listening to his word more than ever, feeding with him more than ever, walking in relationship and in prayer more than ever. &gt;&gt; It's not time to be fellowshipping with the serpent. Think about if if Eve would have recognized, not that there was ever a good time to be talking to the serpent, but what if she had recognized what time is it? Where am I? Where art thou? Oh, it's almost evening time. I I should be walking with Adam and God through the garden right now. &gt;&gt; Why am I here? Why am I having this conversation? Look, a lot of doubts and worries and the gossip of unbelief can be avoided if you'll just avoid the conversations that go with it. &gt;&gt; If you'll just avoid those conversations of doubt and lending your mind to those things. It's time to cast down imagination. It's evening time. Let's get our mind back on the word of God and fellowshipping with him and walking with him and talking with him. &gt;&gt; If you're fellowshipping with him and walking with him, you don't have time for the serpent to get your ear. He don't have opportunity to get you get your ear. And we but we know how that they fail by listening to the lie of the serpent. But really tonight, what I want us to really focus in on is the failure after the fall. The failure after the fall. Because I I don't care how big of a fall it is, how little of a fall, how if it's backsliding, I if it's just a little lukewarmness or or just you got yourself into a situation you shouldn't have because you failed to seek his leadership. No matter what it is tonight, no matter where you are, he is the answer. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that's simple, brother Aaron. We all know that." No, but listen, he is the answer. Because even though we all know that, we never turn to him. &gt;&gt; Our first instinct is to always run away from him. &gt;&gt; Genesis 3 and8 tells us here says, "And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. And the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him, "Where art thou?" He said, "I heard thy voice in the garden. and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself. He was the only one that could truly help them. And yet, he's the only one that can help us. And yet, in those moments of our greatest need, we're afraid of the one thing that can save us. &gt;&gt; The one thing. This is the one that made you. This is the one that formed you. This is the one who loves you. This is the one who wants to help. And he's going through the garden. He's crying, "Adam, Adam, wherefore art thou, Adam? I'm here to fellowship, Adam. It's the cool of the evening. I'm I'm here to bless you tonight, evening light tabernacle. I'm here for you like I've always been. I'm here. Where are you? I'm here to fellowship." And Adam runs and from him and he hides from him. He begins trying to cover up instead of exposing it. church. That's a hard thing to do. But if you'll expose it right when it happens, &gt;&gt; if you'll deal with it right when it happens, then it doesn't have the opportunity to grow and get worse and compound and take a stronghold in your life. &gt;&gt; But in that moment, he he runs away from it. Why do we do it? He brought us out of chaos and he gave us life and he gave us fellowship and and as soon as we begin to struggle and we begin to fail, we try to hide it and we begin rejecting his cause. And the first thing we do is we begin to break off fellowship. We get bitter about something and we let it take root. We say or do something that we shouldn't have and we let some things slip in unchecked. And the first place that it shows is in your fellowship with him and with his people. You used to love to come to church to worship him and to commune with him. And you talked to him during the day and you listened to messages on your way to work. You prayed during the day. You prayed at night. You had communion. And then something happened and some root somewhere got in that wasn't dealt with. some besetting sin or some cycle that haunts you and you start to cut him out of your days. The only one that can save you. &gt;&gt; The only one that can help you. &gt;&gt; The one that's literally searching for you going, "I'm right here. I'm right here. I'm here to forgive you. I'm I'm here to help you. I'm here to deliver you." And we're hiding from it and we're running from it and we're cutting him out. And you start to draw back from him and you give him less. and he moves in a service and you hide and he asks for fellowship and prayer and communion and you don't give it and he misses that communion. He longs for it and he misses your worship and he misses that relationship and he cries out, "Where art thou? Didn't I save you? Didn't I die for you? Where art thou? &gt;&gt; What have I done? Why am I being cut off? Why won't you fellowship with me? Why won't you talk with me? Why won't you worship me? &gt;&gt; Where art thou? We do the exact opposite of what we should be doing. In those moments, as hard as it is, and I know I've been there, but those are the moments to press in more, to cry out more, to worship more, to pray for more, to seek for more, to press the battle harder, not to hide, but to acknowledge where you are. To have an honest heart with God and seek for more of God. Adam should have been running through the garden saying, "Father, Father, Father, where are you? I need you. I've fallen and you're the only one that can help me. I need you, Lord. I failed and you are my only hope. &gt;&gt; He says, "And here he was. Here was the searchings of God walking, running up and down through the garden, screaming for his lost boy. The father hunting, searching for the son. It should have been the son searching for the father. &gt;&gt; Don't make him come looking for you in a service. &gt;&gt; He shouldn't have to come looking for him. You should come here seeking him. &gt;&gt; God, I need you in this service. God, here's where I'm at. I'm not hiding it. You know my failures. You know my flaws. You know my struggles. And I'm here for you to deal with it in my life. But I'm going to worship you tonight. I'm going to praise you tonight. I'm going to open up all the things that have been hidden. And I'm going to allow you to fix me. He's the only one that can fix you. Willpower won't do it. Rules won't do it. Religion won't do it. But Jesus Christ can do it tonight when the spirit of God begins to move on your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We should show up looking for him, seeking after him, being honest with him. Lord, I'm right here and here are my problems. I'm right here, Lord. Listen, all he's looking for is an honest heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just an honest heart. I always look at Ananiah and Safh, you know, when and they came in and y'all know the story in the book of Acts and they had sold a piece of land and instead of coming in and saying you you got to understand, it's an interesting situation. They gave to the Lord and were killed. &gt;&gt; They would have been better off not giving. But the reason is because they wouldn't be honest. See, those before them came and gave all. They came and they became great men through the book of Acts. But then they came and for whatever reason, they wanted to keep some of it or needed to keep some of it. And if they had just came and said, "Peter, I sold some land. We kept this much because we had some things, but I want to give you this offering. Let me tell you what God hates is he hates when you pretend you've given everything. &gt;&gt; God, I've given you my all. I've given you my everything. Why am I going through this? Why am I struggling with this? I completely repented. I gave you my everything. And he's sitting there going, "No, you haven't. No, you haven't." God would rather you say, "Lord, I'm struggling with this and I'm struggling to give you this and here's where I'm at and I got this problem and God, I'm being honest with you. I need you tonight. I haven't given you everything. I recognize that. I need you to move in my life. I need you to help me. Don't pretend you've given everything when you haven't. That you haven't laid everything down when you're holding some of it back. This isn't It's an interesting thing because when you start talking about repentance, people automatically think that means you've fallen away and backslid. This isn't taking your Holy Ghost away at all. This isn't taking your experience away at all or taking your victories away at all. We got to get past that thinking that every little mistake and every little failure, I'm serpent seed. I knew I didn't get it. I guess I didn't get nothing. Listen to admit need and to admit shortcomings to make things right. To acknowledge error to acknowledge I didn't consult him before I made this decision. Those things do not disqualify your testimony. &gt;&gt; That does not disqualify you as a Christian. It doesn't mean you didn't get it or you don't got it. You're listening to the whisper of the serpent because that's his message. You don't have it. Look at your failure. God don't say that. He says, "I see your failure and I got some blood for you. I see your failure and I got something to help you. I see your failure and I'm lifting you up tonight because you're mine. Because you're called, because you're chosen. I know you can't make it, son. That's why I'm here to give you my spirit. Because through me, you can overcome. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You are a child of the living God. You are made to fellowship. You You are made for relationship. You're made to overcome and Satan's trying to keep you hiding in the trees like Adam and Eve with with a covering instead of running to Jesus and repenting. Repenting, listen, repentance is not a one-time thing that you do. Repentance is part of your Christian walk. Listen to your prophet. And God, I repent of everything and knowing that we could not live in ourselves, Lord. But we're sinners to begin with. And daily, somebody say, daily. &gt;&gt; Daily I trust in thee, knowing that daily I sin. &gt;&gt; Knowing that daily things happen to me and in my life that you would not be pleased with. and I confess my wrong and accept thee, my Lord, as my own soul lays at the altar this morning at this little tabernacle prostrate here, Lord. He says, now we was talking on the word backsliding this morning. When you do that, you're backslid. Yes, sir. You've got to repent. Is that right? Now, I don't mean to say you went out in the world and you did this and that, but you done something. I don't care how holy, how pure, how perfect you are. I'm going to put it in his words. You done something. &gt;&gt; We've all sinned and fall short of the glory of God. I'm not making excuses for you to live in sin. And when he says he's sin, we're not talking about you. You you you know what I'm talking about. We're not talking about out smoking, drinking, committing adultery. We're talking about the everyday failures of a human being in life. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "You've got to repent and die daily to live in Jesus Christ." So every daily, every day, you've got to die every day to live in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So quit letting the devil tell you that because you got some things that you need to repent of that you aren't saved and filled with the Holy Ghost. He's keeping you from the freedom and the liberty that comes when you make things right and lay those burdens down. &gt;&gt; I know you've been there where you carried something and it beat on you and it beat on you and it beat on you and you carried it and you carried it and it wore you down and you didn't feel good enough and you didn't feel right. You felt condemnation and all the time that was the devil just trying to get you to hold on to it cuz all you got to do is step out from the bushes. Quit hiding and say, "God, I'm right here. Here it is. I'm giving it to you." And then there's freedom that comes with that. There's rejoicing that comes with that. The burden is taken away from you. He's saying, "Quit hiding tonight. Just admit where you are, and I'm here to take care of you. I'm here to forgive you tonight." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Genesis 3 and8 again they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves. The one thing that can help us. The one thing that can break us out of this slump. Maybe you're in a slump. The one thing that can get us right and here we are hiding covering with religion. hiding ourselves from what? The presence of the Lord. The thing they had longed for, the thing that they had fellowshipped with, and here they are hiding from it. Oh God, I don't want to hide myself tonight. I don't want to hide in my goodness. I don't want to hide in anything I've ever done. Or I'm a preacher. I'm a deacon. I'm a singer. I never miss a church service. You better not be hiding in any of that tonight. You better not be hiding in family name or past works or even anything other than the blood of Jesus Christ, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. If you're going to hide in anything, you better be hid in him tonight. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hide ourselves in him. The scripture says, "Keep me as the apple of the eye. Hide me under the shadow of thy wings. Not I'm hiding myself from him, but Lord, I'm running to you tonight so you can hide me. For in the time of trouble, he shall hide me in his pavilion. In the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall set me upon a rock. Deliver me, oh Lord, from mine enemies. I flee unto thee to hide me. Oh Lord, let your presence surround me. &gt;&gt; Let me be hid in your presence. Not hiding from your presence tonight. Hide me from my enemies. Forgive me of my trespasses. set me upon a rock. You know, we read the story sometimes and and we get it so twisted and we think that God was looking for Adam and Eve to punish them. You don't think God knew where they were? You don't think God knew what they had done? But just as they had sinned on free moral agency, they had to come to him on free moral agency. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you not think he could have carried out the punishment of death without ever seeing them and just saying dead? &gt;&gt; But the reason he was looking for them, the reason he was calling them was because he wasn't looking to judge them. He was looking to provide a lamb for them. And he's saying, "Where art thou? I know the punishment. I know what's about to happen. The sentence is death. Where are you, Adam? Where are you?" He was seeking him in love so that he could kill a lamb and wrap him in those bloody garments. Why is he calling to you tonight? Not to condemn you, not to judge you, but he's looking to wrap you in the blood of Jesus Christ. And he's saying, "Where art thou? Where are you?" I say, "Lord, I'm right here, Lord. I've stumbled and I've struggled and I failed over and over again, but I'm here to accept the blood of the lamb. Wrap me in it, Lord. Wrap me in your forgiveness tonight." Hallelujah. He knew the penalty of it and he was seeking Adam so he could provide a lamb for Adam. Don't he Don't you think he knows where you're at tonight? Don't he think he knows your failures tonight? He just wants you to step out with his honest heart and and say, "Lord, I'm right here. Lord, this is how far I've made it. Maybe I should be farther. Maybe I should be up there. Lord, I but this is where I'm at." &gt;&gt; Amen. This is where I'm at and I'm asking you to come, Lord, and wrap me in your love and restore me back to that fellowship. This is how I'm struggling. He doesn't want to judge you tonight. He wants to give you mercy tonight. He knows what the judgment's coming. &gt;&gt; But this isn't that tonight. He's still on the mercy seat. He's still calling. He's still drawing. He's calling you so that he can forgive you, that he can wrap you in his arms, wash you in his forgiveness. And he wants to pour more of his life into you so that you can progress, so that you can overcome. Brother Aaron, I was filled with the spirit years ago. That's wonderful. Be filled again. Seek more tonight. Lord, I listen. I never take people's testimony away from them. I never do. If they say, "Brother Aaron, I thought I I thought I had it, but then I did this." That don't mean go back and say, "I didn't have nothing." Just say, "Lord, thank you for what you did, but tonight I need more. Lord, thank you for what you've done in the past, but tonight I need a refilling. Thank you for that, but I need another step, Lord. I'm struggling in this area of my life. Pour out more tonight, Lord, and fill me fresh and a new once again. &gt;&gt; It's our only hope, and it's our only approach. It's our only way to overcome. It's our only way to rapture is through the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's the only thing. The life of that blood coming back on us is the only thing that'll take you out of here. He says here, "And God provided an approach there for Adam in the Garden of Eden and through the shedding of the blood of the innocent to appropriate an approach to him. Then Adam could once more come through the shed blood of the lamb to the approach and talk face to face again with God through the blood through the approach that God provided for him." Amen. Now, notice the shedding of blood brought Adam back in fellowship to talk face to face with God once again. That was the whole point originally, relationship, fellowship. God's bringing that back around. And that's what he wants once again in this day. He wants the life of that blood to come into you and to restore fellowship and relationship with you and God. But too many times instead of the life of that blood, we begin hiding behind our religion. And we actually get comfortable there in our religion. And we hide from the presence of God so long that it becomes the norm for us. &gt;&gt; No fellowship, no worship, no communion. I didn't say you wasn't at church. I didn't say you didn't tell people you was a believer, but no fellowship, no worship, no communion, just duty. I'm there every Sunday and Wednesday, but do you fellowship between Sunday and Wednesday? Do you worship when you're here? Is there relationship in your life? But we feel safe because we come to church. We feel hidden and covered and wrapped up in the traditions of church. But I'm going to tell you something and you know this and I know this from my own personal experiences. There is no victory as a church member. There is no overcoming power as a church member. Amen. And because you're hidden and not exposed, then the failures begin to stack up and they stay hidden and they grow and they compound and you get more issues and more bitterness and more coldness. Listen, he's inviting you tonight to step out from behind that covering. &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, I'm right here and run to him with all of your might and try to fight to get to him because we got to have the power. We got to have God's power to transform, not man's power to reform. Your reformation will not keep you." I'm thankful if you're trying to do better. I'm thankful that you're trying. Listen, I'm gonna go ahead. I'm always open and honest. I tried and tried and tried for years and failed and failed and failed for years. And I'd come to an altar and I'd do good for three months. And then I'd come to the altar and do good for six months. And then sometimes I'd come to the altar and do good for a day. But I was trying and I wasn't laying things down and I was pretending I gave all and I was acting the part. But if you ever get to the place that you say, "Lord, I'm a failure. I'm no good. I'm nothing. And without you, I can't make it." and you lay it all down and you surrender everything and his life comes into your life and you experience the new birth. Then there's no devil in hell can stop you. There's nothing can stand before you. There's nothing can keep you from overcoming because your nature has been changed. &gt;&gt; There's power in the new birth. There's no power in being a church member. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would deal with this over and over and over again throughout his ministry. You can you can just type in two words afraid of and go through that search. How that humans are always afraid and they run from the very thing that can bring them salvation. They're always afraid of what they need. Three scriptures here. One we've read several times. I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid. The voice of God. Matthew 14, we'll just read 26. And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, "It is a spirit." And they cried out in fear. And when even was now come, his disciples went down into the sea, and entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernium. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them. And the sea rose by a great wind that blew. And when they had rode about five and 20 or 30 furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea drawing nigh unto the ship and they were afraid. Listen to me. Don't ever let yourself or your family or this church become a place that is afraid when Jesus comes calling. &gt;&gt; Afraid when the spirit of God begins to move. Listen, I I I know it's something that we deal with often and it's not to call anybody out. It's not to correct other churches or other ministries. That's not our job. But as we travel and we see certain movements and we see certain spirits trying to creep in and and we see ministry going a certain way and doctrines begin to take hold and what we understand is is that eventually you're going to come in contact with it. Whether it be through streaming or visiting or meetings or whatever or just because it's the spirit of the age and spirits aren't contained by walls. &gt;&gt; It's the spirit of the age to be okay with being a church member and not going all the way to the new birth. &gt;&gt; It's the spirit of the age and it's a spirit that moves exactly like those denominational spirits that operates under the guise of protecting you. Every denomination that was ever formed formed to protect the word of truth they had. &gt;&gt; And they formed and said, "We're we got to protect this." And they wouldn't move on. &gt;&gt; And we got to protect this. And they wouldn't move on. And under the guise of protection, walls are built. And they're not your protection, but they entrap you. &gt;&gt; Protect you from fanaticism, protect you from being deceived as to what the Holy Ghost really is. Well, we don't want you to shout and jump and dance and and be deceived and think you got the Holy Ghost because that's not the Holy Ghost. So, in order to protect you from that, we're just not going to shout and jump and dance. Wh What's wrong with it? We're protecting you. We're protecting you from fanaticism and protecting you from worship that is out of order. So, we would do away with freedom of worship and the moving of the spirit to protect you &gt;&gt; so that you don't get out of order. we're going to protect you. And the spirit tries to move in and it uses fear as a reason to tamp down on the moving of the spirit. And it does so to keep people from the one thing that can save them in this day, the Holy Ghost, the new birth, the token. You must have it. And in order to get it, you need to be in the right atmosphere to receive it. And I'm not going to tamp down on anything that's going to keep people from receiving the new birth. But what I'm afraid of is that more and more people are just message believers and not born again believers &gt;&gt; hiding behind God sent a prophet covered behind by by a belief system no real fellowship no real relationship no birth and then we see Jesus there in Revelation 3 20 and he's standing outside the door and he's knocking and he's looking for somebody to suffer. with him. You ever noticed that? To sit down with and fellowship, somebody to break bread with, somebody to have a relationship with, &gt;&gt; somebody to fellowship with him, but they're hiding inside the house with the door locked and he isn't welcome. And this is a where art thou moment in the New Testament. Think about it. I You go back to the very beginning and you can see him running through Eden searching and he's saying, "I've done so much. I I I've made an Eden out of the chaos. I created sons and daughters to fellowship with me and to have relationship with me and and now they're hiding from me. Where art thou? And then he goes through all the trouble in this day and restores all the truth so that you can have the true new birth from the book of Acts. And he's done so much and he brought a bride out of chaos and he's restored everything that was lost. And he brings a people back to a place of fellowship. And many have abandoned that relationship in that true fellowship of the birth for I believe the message. And they've become ashamed of his presence. They're ashamed to have him in their midst. And so they've locked the door and he's having to stand there knocking. Where art thou? &gt;&gt; Why am I not welcome in your churches? They don't want to see him come walking on the water. They don't want to see him walking up to their ship. They're afraid of him as he runs through Satan's Eden crying, "Where art thou? Will somebody praise me? Will somebody worship? Will somebody let me in? Somebody let me fellowship? Somebody let me have relationship? Somebody let me save? Somebody let me heal. Somebody let me fill you with my precious Holy Spirit. Somebody where art thou?" Don't be afraid of it. Evening like tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's Jesus walking on the water tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh, when he begins to move and joy breaks out and people's hearts and people shout and people dance. That's Jesus walking on their water. &gt;&gt; You wasn't in the boat with them. You don't know the situation. That boat was going under. The sail was broke. But Jesus came walking on the water. &gt;&gt; And they're overjoyed. They were saved. They were delivered. How dare I rob their joy from them? &gt;&gt; Take their shout from them. That's Jesus moving on the people. It's not out of order. Listen, you're a prophet. One night on a storming ocean when all hopes was gone and the little boat was about to sink, the disciples saw Jesus come walking on the water and they got scared because they thought he was a spirit. Isn't that just like people today? He was the only thing that could help him. He was their only hope and yet they were afraid of him. And today, oh listen to me. He says the only hope there is today is a thing that people are afraid of. That's an old time St. Paul's revival and the Bible Holy Ghost back again. &gt;&gt; Pay close attention to this line. Don't think it'll make you misbehave yourself. That's the devil's business to keep you afraid of Christ. &gt;&gt; But it's the only salvation left for any nation is the Lord Jesus and the power of his resurrection. But people are afraid of it. Oh, but they run and they dance. What? Why are you taking up the devil's business? That's the devil's business. He says, he says, "What are they afraid of? The new birth. That's the reason we got grandchildren in the church. Afraid of the new birth. Afraid of the Holy Ghost. Afraid of the power of God. Afraid it'll make them wash some of the makeup off of you or something. That's what's the matter. God sent us an old time revival. Bring forth the Holy Ghost. And there's plenty of it. &gt;&gt; I'm just leaning on the authority of a prophet right now. Oh, all of a sudden they heard the sound of a rushing mighty wind. Here comes the inoculation. He inoculated 120 brother. They went into a fit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They went into a fit when he inoculated them. fell out in all kinds of shines. They jumped and danced and spoke in tongues and run through the streets, but they was inoculated. That's why they're afraid of. You're afraid of the serum. It'll make you act funny, but oh my, what a feeling. What a safety it gives you when you're inoculated. I just want to be inoculated. I just want to have the serum in my body, in every fiber of my being. If it makes me act like a fool, if it makes me act like a drunk, I don't care. What a feeling. What a feeling to know you're inoculated in this day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Afraid of it. I ask again, where are we? We've rejected him and accepted theology and psychology. He made us to be filled with the spirit, not filled with theology. He made us to move in the winds of the spirit. And we're letting old spirits and old ideas that the devil's used for thousands of years repackage itself as message theology and sit it out there and we're swallowing it. We're allowing it to be preached as the truth. Listen, you must be born again just like they were on the day of Pentecost. Jesus himself said, "You must be born again. You must be." That's the main place the devil's attacking this message. Maybe he hasn't moved you on the doctrine. Maybe he hasn't moved you on the message. Maybe you'll stand up for this message with all your heart. That's awesome. That's commendable. But if he can back you off the new birth, if he can get you right there, then he has you in a place that you cannot rapture. &gt;&gt; Let's be clear. You will not rapture without the new birth. &gt;&gt; You will not rapture without the token. And you can't get the token outside the message. But just because you're in the message doesn't mean you got the token. &gt;&gt; It means you got access to it. But he needs an honest heart. He needs somebody to go, "God, I got to have it. I don't care what I got to do, where I got to go. I just got to have you tonight, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. It's just like in Samuel when God said to Samuel, he said to him, he said, "Don't worry, Samuel. They haven't rejected you. They've rejected me. They're not denying the doctrines of the message. They're not saying William Brandon wasn't a prophet. They're not saying those things, but they're rejecting the life of Christ." &gt;&gt; And he can sit there and say to the seventh angel, "It's not your fault. They're not rejecting you. They're rejecting me. &gt;&gt; They're rejecting my life. They're rejecting the leadership of the Holy Spirit. Prophet of God says they're ashamed of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. They're ashamed of the moving of God's Holy Ghost. They're too classical. That makes them join the church. They do that because they're afraid of the new birth. Afraid. Where art thou? They're hiding behind their religion. just another set of religious values and message theology. And in that place, we feel safer, hidden, covered. But I'm telling you tonight, that won't work. &gt;&gt; Your religion is no better than anybody else's religion. &gt;&gt; The only thing that makes you above anybody else is the grace, unmmerited grace of God that has given you access to the new birth, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And until you receive that, brother Aaron, I'm a believer. I said it before and I know it sounds harsh, but all that does is put you on the same level as the devil. &gt;&gt; He is a believer. He's a believer of this message. &gt;&gt; There ain't no way you could convince him it ain't the truth. &gt;&gt; Well, I I believe it with all my heart. So does he. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you what's different is he has no future. He can't be born again. He's going to hell. and he thinks he's taking you with him. But I got news for him tonight. You are bloodbought. You are bloodwashed. You are a predestinated seed. You are a seed gene of God. That's the difference. You're not going to stop at believing. But you're going to say, "Lord, I believe and I receive and I want everything that you have for my life. I'm opening myself up tonight with an honest heart saying, "Fill me fresh and a new Lord Jesus." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. These quotes kind of shocked me because it made me realize it's a lot more serious than what we think. It's not as simple as, well, they just see it different and we're all under the same glorious message, so we're all going to be there. They all left under Moses's message, too, following a pillar of fire and they all went through the Red Sea and they all ate mana in the wilderness. They all looked on the brass serpent and they didn't all get there. But these quotes, I'll just be honest, they were mind-blowing to me. He says, "Why? He's the same Christ yesterday, today, and forever. His power cannot fail because he's God. God's divine order of the earth, the Holy Spirit today is just the same as he was." To reject Jehovah was a penalty. To reject Jesus was a penalty. And to reject this, now what's he talking about? What people call fanaticism. And what people call foolishness is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; He said to speak a word against it would never be forgiven in this world to come. This right here, it's more of a penalty to reject what people call fanaticism. To reject the Holy Spirit today than it would be to reject Jesus Christ or the Father. That's right. Now, if a man rejected God in the days of the fatherhood under Moses and the law, well, he was put to death. If he disobeyed God, broke his command. When Jesus came, he said, "Now, whosoever speaks a word against the son of man, it shall be forgiven him. But whosoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will never be forgiven him in this world, this world or the one to come." So, to reject the Holy Spirit tonight is more serious than to reject God the Father in the days of Moses or to reject Jesus Christ when he was walking in flesh. Think about that. So I say this very solemnly and humbly and not to pick on anybody. So even if you're unsure and you look at people the way they worship and the way they react and the way they do things in service when if I were you even if it's not for you I would keep my mouth shut about it. That's all That's all I'm saying. &gt;&gt; But I would also encourage you to accept it. &gt;&gt; Accept the jump. No. Accept the shout. No. That's the way they're worshiping. And if God leads you to do that, great. Accept what's making them jump. &gt;&gt; Accept what's making them shout. &gt;&gt; Except that we're never all going to worship the same. This ain't even a sermon about worship. It's about receiving God when he moved through the place. That's what it's about. About being open and honest with God when he's calling on your heart and drawing you. But to stand there and to mock or make fun or knock down the moving of the spirit is a very serious thing. Brother Brandham says he was the word and when they rejected him, they rejected the word. And when they did reject him, they finally crucified him. And that's what they done today. rejected the word of God and accepted their creeds and has crucified publicly before their congregation the working of the Holy Spirit and they're guilty. And I indict them in the name of Jesus Christ. They mock the praise. They criticize the shouting. They criticize the rejoicing. They criticize the altar cause. Why? They're afraid. They're afraid that it might not be him, that it might be a workup, that it might be an emotion. He says, "And today, the Methodists, the Baptist, the Luther, the Pentecostal everywhere around, if you don't watch out, friends, the real cornerstone, you'll reject it. And the cornerstone in the building of this supernatural house is the Holy Spirit. You're afraid of it. You're afraid of fanaticism." I know we got a lot of old scarecrows in mockery. In other words, he says, "I know there's a lot of it." I'll just use this word, fake. I don't think there's anybody in this ministry or this church that don't acknowledge that. There's a lot of it. Fake. I won't use the word fake. That's harsh. Emotion. Worked up. Got excited. You went because they went. I read in the Bible where all the ladies went because Miriam went. Moses didn't have a problem with it. She went and says and they all followed her. &gt;&gt; So that's I'm fine. But what I'm saying is I understand. But how many of y'all are going to refuse a paycheck this week because you know there's fake money out there. &gt;&gt; I'm not taking a $100 bill from you because somewhere somebody's got fake ones. &gt;&gt; That's stupid. I'm not willing to tamp down the ones that are fake or emotional or however you want to say it because I don't criticize people's worship. &gt;&gt; Whatever word you want to use, I'm not willing to get rid of that and lose the real too. &gt;&gt; I ain't willing to do it. &gt;&gt; I'll take a little wildfire if it means there's some real fire moving in there. &gt;&gt; Every single time I'll take it. He's trying to give us the token and people are worried about the reaction of the person receiving the token. He's trying to bless and heal and deliver and we're worried about how they might act when they get healed and blessed and delivered. Afraid of what might come with it. Afraid of a fake. Afraid of a workup. Just like when they saw Jesus coming, and I'm not going to read the whole thing, but straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, "Be of good cheer. It is I. Be not afraid." And how many times have we seen that? Lives changed, people healed, people delivered. And that's God saying, "It's me. Oh, that was me. Don't be afraid." And yet still there's that Peter in the back going, "If it's you. I wonder what he was going to do if it wasn't him." I guess just go back to being afraid. I don't know. It's me. It's Jesus. I'm walking on water. I'm delivering. I'm healing. I'm saving. I'm filling with the Holy Ghost. Yeah, but them people shout, "Lord, if it's you," they're worried it might not be him. He says, "It's me. Look at the lives that are being changed. Look at the victories." But they're afraid of him. Afraid of what service might look like if they let the people get free. I'm afraid of what services look like when we don't get free. All right. &gt;&gt; I'm afraid of what life looks like without the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; All I know is the storm didn't cease until he got in the boat. &gt;&gt; So, quit being afraid and say, "Jesus, come get in the boat. Come on. I may not understand it. I don't know how you're walking on water. This is kind of scary. I don't know why you're doing what you're doing. I don't know why they're dancing the way they're dancing. I don't know why they're doing all that, but I want you in the boat. If it's you, Lord, come on in. I want the storms to cease. I want a body change. I want a rapture. So I will accept you tonight however you come to me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Church, I ain't after a workup. I I ain't after a run and a jump with no life behind it. But I know that that that if it's fake or it's a workup or it's just emotion that there's some real there, too. And the bogus is only there to scare you away from the real. And if we tamp down and say, "Well, there's no more of that." Then you lose the real two. He says, "We're stopping too much for little social things. We're stopping too much intolerant with the world. We're stopping too much. We're stopping too much to see if we don't get a little too fanatically. I'm scared of He says, I love this quote. I'm more scared. I'm more afraid of a person that's afraid than I am the person that's a fanatic. I'm more afraid of the person that's afraid than I am the person that's a fanatic. That's right. I'd rather have a little wildfire than no fire at all. Sure, I would. I'd rather be around a fire that's popping and jumping anytime if the world's cold. Why would he say that? I'm more afraid of the people that are afraid. Why? because he knew what people who are afraid would do with worship. &gt;&gt; He knew what people who were afraid would do. They'll go formal and they'll attack worship and they'll try to return it to a box, a denominational box that is dead. And he knows that they'll try to control it. Listen, I want the fire of God to burn through this place every single service. And if that means a little wildfire breaks out in here, so be it. We'll deal with that. But I'm not going to put out the fire of God. I can study the church down through the Bible and see what happens when there's no fire. &gt;&gt; I can look at churches around the country and see what happens when there's no fire. I can read the Bible and see what happens when there's no fire. People aren't changed. The church becomes a habitation of every unclean and hateful bird. Demons go unchecked. But I can also see what happens when the fire of God's in the place. Brother Brandham says when God shows up, he usually shows up in fire. &gt;&gt; So I see when the lions tried to eat Daniel, the fire held him back. When the Red Sea tried to stop the children of Israel, the pillar of fire parted it. When they tried to burn up the three huboo children, the fire of God came in and pushed back the fire of the enemy. Why? My God is a consuming fire. I want him to consume this place. I'm not afraid of wildfire, but I'll tell you what, animals are afraid of the fire. Demons are afraid of the fire. Sickness is afraid of the fire. Your trouble tonight is afraid of the fire. I say, "Welcome the fire of God. Don't run from it. Don't be afraid of it. Say, "Pour it out, Lord. Let your fire consume me tonight. Consume this congregation." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, you say, "Brother Aaron, I've drifted and I'm cold. I'm going the wrong way." that same fire met Saul on the road down to Damascus. And in a moment coming in contact with that fire, he went from a persecutor &gt;&gt; to an apostle. &gt;&gt; He went from one going to try to kill the gospel to the first messenger of the age. One moment in his presence can change your life forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What are you saying, brother Aaron? I'm saying run to him tonight with all your heart. Don't run from that fire. Don't run from that voice calling you tonight. Where art thou? Run to him with everything you've got. Fight to get to him. Push through every hindrance. Run through every complex. Run through every besetting sin tonight. And say, "I got to get to Jesus. Where art thou? I'm right here, Lord. I'm right here. And I recognize I need you." &gt;&gt; Let him in your boat tonight. &gt;&gt; You want victory in your life? Let him in your boat tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm closing. Brother Brown says, "Someone said not long ago, I'm afraid to receive the Holy Ghost. I'm afraid it would make me speak in tonesues like them others. I don't care if I spoke in tonesues, talk in tones, crowed in tonesues, or anything else. I want the Holy Ghost. That's the main principle. I don't care what level it is. I'll meet God on his level. What he wants to say is right. There's where I want to stand. The new birth that changes a man, changes a woman, changes their desires, changes their appetites. We can't keep it from the people. We can't encourage them to hide from it. We've got to fan the flames. Musicians, you can come. Just want to read this last quote to you. It's so powerful when you go through the message of the hour and recognize where he stood on these things. These aren't our opinions at Evening Like Tabernacle. He says, 'We've bound the Holy Spirit with our organizations and traditions. We can't have Holy Ghost revival. I know that's scorching hot with the weather, but it's the truth. How can we have a Holy Ghost revival when you're so bound and starchy? Form of godliness. The Bible said they have form of godliness, but deny the power thereof. The power of what? The power of the organization, the power of the world, the power of the church, the power of the Holy Ghost. That's the secret place in the church. And when the church adopts educated preachers, big buildings and finery instead of the old-fashioned Holy Ghost, they better be in the mission again. Amen. Truth. How you going to have a revival of the Holy Ghost and people quench it and bound it and are afraid of it? That's where the trouble lies. The Philistines is on thee. But the one blessed hope we have. While Samson was in jail, here's the only hope that I have this morning to wind up my message is this. While Samson was bound, a new shock of hair grow out. &gt;&gt; God sent us another church just before the end time that the power of the Holy Ghost can come into her &gt;&gt; in the denomination in the demonstrations of the spirit. Mark 16 can follow the church. Acts 2:4, Acts 2:38, all of it will be following right along with the church. Signs, wonders accompany the apostles. Great signs of his resurrection accompany them. while we're in prison. Surely God's growing a crop somewhere for the last great kill. &gt;&gt; Oh, what's he talking about right there? In Samson's death, he took out more Philistines than he did in his whole life. &gt;&gt; He's saying there's going to be one more kill. Every devil of hell has been gathered into Leodysia. And Satan thinks it's for your destruction. And he says, "I got a church. I got a crop. I got a people." They're not afraid of the Holy Spirit. They're not running from it, but they're embracing it. And they're here for the final kill. We're taking them out. We're taking them out. We're leaving here with every devil defeated, every devil under our feet. We will conquer more devils in our departure than we did the whole time we were here. We're at the point of the last great kill. &gt;&gt; Oh, run to him tonight with all of your heart. &gt;&gt; Say, "I'm right here, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm not hiding from you, &gt;&gt; Lord. I've failed. I've struggled. I've got bitterness. I've got unforgiveness. But I'm laying that aside and I'm saying, "It's me, Lord. &gt;&gt; It's me standing in the need of prayer. &gt;&gt; Where art thou? &gt;&gt; Where art thou? You're going to ignore him? You're going to hide from me? Or you just going to acknowledge, I'm right here? &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm right here. &gt;&gt; And I know you're the only one that can help me. &gt;&gt; You're the only one that can save me. You're the only one that can deliver me. Father, Lord, we're not going to hide from you. We're not going to make excuses, Lord. Lord, but we're just standing here tonight going, "Lord, we need you, Lord. I'm not hiding in the garden no more. I'm not hiding behind religion. I'm not hiding behind I believe this message, but Lord, I got to have you. Lord, I've stumbled. I got to have you. I've failed. I got to have you. Lord, I've come short. I got to have you. I'm not going to hide and let this build and compound and get worse and worse and worse. I'm here right now saying, "Lord, it's me. You called and I've answered. Where art thou? I'm right here, Lord. I'm right here." What's he calling you for? To judge you? No. Just to wrap you in his forgiveness. &gt;&gt; Just to say, "I love you. I made you for relationship. And all I'm trying to do is bring you back into relationship. All I'm trying to do is bringing you back into fellowship. All I'm doing tonight saying, "Come back. My arms are open. I got a bloody lamb. I'm going to wrap you in the robe of righteousness. I'm going to trade your sins for my righteousness. I'm going to fill you with the spirit. I'm going to refill you. I'm going to pick you up where you fell down. Oh, hallelujah. Quit listening to the devil. You're not defeated. You're not defeated. Just get up. I'm going to tell you right now. I've said it before, but I just feel it right now. Nobody remembers that fighter getting punched in the seventh round. &gt;&gt; They remember who won. They remember whose hand was raised. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother. And I got punched. I got knocked down. I got hit in the first round, second round, third round, fourth round. I keep getting hit. Oh, praise the Lord. But you keep getting up. You keep coming back to the middle of the ring. You keep answering the bell. Why? You're called to overcome. I don't remember who got punched. I remember who the champion is. I remember who won the fight. Who's the winner? You are the winner. You're the overcomer of the age. You're called. You're chosen. You're forgiven. And you're going to rapture. &gt;&gt; Quit listening to the lie of the devil. Oh, I can't make it. You're going to make it. You're going to be there. You and your offspring with you. Just press the battle. Fight to get to him. He's calling you tonight. What's he calling me to? Relationship. You mean he doesn't He's not calling me cuz he's angry. No, he knows where you're at. He knows what you did. He knows your struggle. He's calling you cuz you're a free moral agent. You got to be willing to say, "I'm right here, Lord." &gt;&gt; And he says, "Yeah, you are. I knew where you were. &gt;&gt; I just wanted you to love me. &gt;&gt; I just wanted you to fellowship. I just want to love you tonight." &gt;&gt; Church, keep pressing the battle. Have an honest heart. Be open with God. And don't be hindered by your own failures and fears and complexes. God loved you and died for you knowing those things. He knew every mess up. He knew every failure. And he said, "Yeah, that one's mine. That one. That one." Do you see how often he messes up? Yeah. He's going to need some mighty strong blood. But I know somebody. There's a lamb slain before the foundation of the world for me in my mess up and my failures. And tonight he says, "What sin? What sin? Where art thou?" I can tell you where I'm at. I'm in the Lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; That's where I see myself tonight. I see myself in eternity. I know one thing I don't see. I don't see myself going down. I don't see myself giving up. Where art thou even like tabernacle? We're right here. We're still standing. We're still fighting. We are the victors of the age. Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the Lord. God bless you tonight. You alone are all I need. For you are my [Music] You alone all I need. Glory. I am complete. I say [Music] I'll come running at you. Oh, draw me, draw me home. I'll come running.

He did not have the Holy Ghost, friends. We do. And God said, "That's a man after my own heart." Because he turned completely. Amen. May we be that kind of people. Amen. Have a wonderful week.
