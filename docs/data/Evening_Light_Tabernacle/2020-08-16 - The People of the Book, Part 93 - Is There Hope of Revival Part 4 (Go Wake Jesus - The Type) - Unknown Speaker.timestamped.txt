[43:27] me and you know he's got your number
[43:29] you're coming to
[43:30] i'm sending out a message you can't stay
[43:33] out there in the big slot very much
[43:35] longer

[43:41] hallelujah
[43:46] we're here in the end time where
[43:48] prophecy is being fulfilled
[43:52] today i'm going to baptize brother mike
[43:54] here at the end of the service
[43:56] in the name of the lord jesus as he does
[43:58] his first voiceover
[44:02] gives a public witness
[44:05] that the old man is truly dead and he's
[44:09] rising up in the newness of life
[44:12] to serve the living god
[44:15] amen lord we thank you today
[44:19] we glorify your name because
[44:26] you're the only one could ever reach
[44:28] down
[44:29] and find us but you won't leave one of
[44:32] your children out there
[44:36] love us god
[44:39] so loved the world
[44:43] god so loved me and he gave his own life
[44:47] on my account
[44:49] that i could have life and life more
[44:51] abundantly
[44:53] and that old teeth that came to rob and
[44:56] to steal
[44:57] and destroy we are coming here today to
[45:01] claim back everything the devil stole
[45:03] from us
[45:04] souls of men and women who is he is
[45:07] taken
[45:07] out is it's an hour of restoration
[45:11] and we believe god and we believe his
[45:13] word
[45:14] and we thank you lord for your blessing
[45:16] to us today and as we look into the word
[45:19] will you just speak to hearts
[45:22] speak to lives amen
[45:26] just deal with them lord wherever they
[45:28] are right here in this building there
[45:29] are those that need satan right here in
[45:32] this building there are those that need
[45:33] healing
[45:35] maybe someone needs a spiritual healing
[45:38] a revival on the inside and they can
[45:41] have
[45:42] an old-fashioned pentecostal revival
[45:45] they can have it in themselves even
[45:47] though the world won't see a worldwide
[45:49] sweep and revival we can have it
[45:51] in ourselves we thank you for it father
[45:55] asking that you bless us now as we look
[45:58] into your word lord may you just help us
[46:00] in these things we pray in jesus name
[46:04] amen amen god bless you good to see
[46:08] each one of you today that are here
[46:10] visiting with us
[46:11] and those that are always so journey
[46:14] together with us the bride around the
[46:16] world
[46:16] that is um streaming here today
[46:20] god is here to meet your need and we
[46:22] know that
[46:23] because he's he's god
[46:26] amen he cares for his people matthew
[46:29] chapter 8 verse 23
[46:31] we're going to read from um here
[46:35] and um i'm going to be speaking on today
[46:39] part 4 of is their hope of revival
[46:44] and we're going to be using go wake
[46:47] jesus
[46:48] the type because this is a type there's
[46:51] actually two of them we'll speak about
[46:53] it a moment but i've only used this part
[46:55] as a title
[46:56] um but there's another another one that
[46:59] brother branham would use
[47:01] to foreshadow the day that we're living
[47:04] in
[47:05] how many know that all the word that was
[47:08] spoken in the groom has to be fulfilled
[47:10] in the bride
[47:11] amen so matthew 28 i mean chapter 8
[47:15] verse 23 and when he was entered into a
[47:18] ship his disciples followed him
[47:21] and behold there arose a great tempest
[47:24] in the sea
[47:25] in so much that the ship was covered
[47:27] with the waves
[47:28] but he was asleep and his disciples came
[47:32] to him
[47:33] and awoke him and said lord save us
[47:36] we perish and he said unto them
[47:40] why are ye fearful o ye of little faith
[47:44] and then he arose and rebuked the winds
[47:47] and the sea and there was a great calm
[47:51] but the men marveled saying what
[47:54] manner of man is this
[47:57] that even the winds and the way and the
[48:00] seas obey him
[48:02] and when he was come to the other side
[48:04] into the country
[48:05] of the gurgaons there met him to
[48:09] possess with devils coming out of the
[48:11] tombs exceeding fear
[48:13] so that no man might pass that way
[48:16] then matthew chapter 14 and verse 22
[48:21] i'd like to read here this is actually
[48:24] the other one brother branham would use
[48:26] as a type of the end time type of the
[48:29] last days if he would preach on this
[48:32] many times after the seals he would
[48:35] preach on these subjects
[48:37] from these scriptures and straightway
[48:39] jesus constrained his disciples to get
[48:41] into his ship and to go before him to
[48:43] the other side and he sent them
[48:45] while he sent them multitudes away and
[48:48] when he had sent the multitudes away he
[48:50] went up to a mountain
[48:51] apart to pray and when even was come he
[48:54] was there alone
[48:56] but the ship was now in the midst of the
[48:58] sea tossed with waves
[49:00] for the wind was contrary in the fourth
[49:03] night of the
[49:04] fourth watch of the night jesus went
[49:06] unto them walking on the sea
[49:09] and when the disciples saw him walking
[49:11] on the sea
[49:12] they were troubled saying it is a spirit
[49:16] and they cried out for fear but to stray
[49:19] away jesus
[49:20] spake unto them be of good cheer
[49:24] it is i be not afraid
[49:27] and peter answered him and said lord if
[49:30] thou
[49:31] if it be thou bid me come unto thee
[49:34] on the water and he said come and when
[49:38] peter was come
[49:39] down out of the ship he walked on the
[49:41] water to go
[49:42] to jesus and when he saw the wind
[49:46] butchers he was afraid and began to sink
[49:49] and he cried
[49:49] saying lord save me and immediately
[49:52] jesus stretched forth his hand and
[49:54] caught him
[49:55] and said unto him o thou of little faith
[49:58] wherefore didest thou
[50:00] doubt and when they were coming to the
[50:03] ship
[50:04] the wind ceased then they that were
[50:08] in the ship came and worshiped them
[50:10] saying of truth
[50:12] thou art the son of god amen god bless
[50:16] you
[50:16] as you are seated now brother branham
[50:20] often talked about two classes of people
[50:24] and they were the fundamentals and the
[50:27] pentecostals
[50:29] and he said in my travels i find two
[50:32] classes of people and i
[50:34] i just want to say that you know spirits
[50:37] don't die
[50:38] and and you know things just move right
[50:41] forward and so you just you can see them
[50:45] in
[50:45] maybe in one move or one time and they
[50:48] will resurface
[50:50] right on down into the end time
[50:52] prophecies
[50:54] and he said one of them in these classes
[50:56] is a fundamental positionally
[50:58] they know by the mechanics that they are
[51:01] to be
[51:02] sons and daughters of god then he said i
[51:05] find the nexus of pentecostals and they
[51:07] with the baptism of the holy ghost
[51:10] or the holy spirit now i want to say
[51:12] this
[51:13] this baptism there in that time
[51:16] era was rarely upon the soul but
[51:20] just on the flesh realm and you know
[51:23] just screaming
[51:24] and shouting and with worked up emotion
[51:26] and brother branham
[51:28] of course told him you know you you've
[51:30] got where you can whoop up the music as
[51:32] long as the music's going where you're
[51:33] shouting and whatever
[51:35] but he said how are you living after all
[51:37] the shout is gone
[51:40] and so you know we we know
[51:43] of course that everywhere that jesus is
[51:46] there is noise amen
[51:49] but there can be noise in jesus not
[51:51] present anywhere
[51:54] and brother branham would say we can get
[51:56] noise confused
[51:58] with the anointing he said noise isn't
[52:00] the anointing no no
[52:01] i've seen where there's a lot of noise
[52:03] and not enough faith to cure a toothache
[52:06] you've got to come solemnly to the
[52:08] father
[52:10] and so again you know he said i and i'm
[52:12] just giving a couple of these quotes but
[52:14] he said i've seen people shout and
[52:15] praise the lord not enough faith to heal
[52:17] a toothache
[52:18] now some some and especially
[52:22] in the seven thunder group under brother
[52:24] joe coleman there that they were trained
[52:26] to give a response
[52:28] and it was a trained response because
[52:31] they had to show this
[52:33] that they now had the token it was their
[52:35] evidence they were filled with the holy
[52:36] ghost because they said amen to the word
[52:40] and so they gave a trained
[52:43] response of running to the platform and
[52:46] standing and shouting and screaming to
[52:48] the preaching
[52:50] noise um that has sometimes been
[52:53] confused
[52:54] for the true anointing uh you know but
[52:57] much of it is no different from the
[52:59] priest of
[53:00] baal who elijah mocked as they tried to
[53:03] scream down the power of god and you
[53:05] cannot
[53:06] scream down his power you cannot work
[53:09] it up you can work up a motion but not
[53:12] the power of god and
[53:14] and and many times you know pictures are
[53:17] shown
[53:17] and even films and snippets are shown to
[53:20] this
[53:20] and you see and and it's touted as the
[53:23] bride's revival but it's just noise
[53:27] now the evidence of the holy ghost is
[53:29] not noise
[53:31] the evidence of the holy ghost is a
[53:33] surrendered
[53:34] life to god amen a life
[53:38] that that is worthy of the gospel that
[53:41] lives for christ
[53:42] that daily walk with god it's shown not
[53:45] in a
[53:46] an instance of a tongue or a shout or
[53:49] on a sunday but it's a life that
[53:53] must be manifested an everyday
[53:56] walk with christ obedience to the word
[53:59] of god
[54:00] no no denial of any promise of god
[54:04] now you know as a result we've it's sad
[54:06] but those
[54:07] under this umbrella of the message in
[54:10] this
[54:11] group their leaders have been in jail
[54:13] for ponzi scheme which built
[54:15] thousands of dollars from other
[54:16] believers
[54:18] and along with you know them are you
[54:21] know
[54:21] some of their high favored deacons
[54:24] like in europe or one of them molested
[54:28] his granddaughters while
[54:29] the elders blamed the underage girls
[54:32] rather than the man who did the naughty
[54:34] deed
[54:36] and this is what happens you know when
[54:37] you go out on a motion
[54:40] and you leave the word of god now
[54:43] brother branham said in all things he
[54:45] says oh you say i went down there and
[54:47] there was a lot of power
[54:49] brother the whole floor was dancing in
[54:51] the spirit and
[54:52] not enough faith to heal a toothache you
[54:55] call that power that's not power that's
[54:57] blessings
[54:58] there's a lot of difference between
[55:00] blessings and power
[55:02] god makes his blessings to upon the
[55:05] righteous and the unrighteous
[55:06] and and we got to get back to truth
[55:09] friends he said we've got to come back
[55:10] to what god means
[55:12] so a lot of difference between blessings
[55:14] and power so we have these two
[55:16] groups you know some are fundamental and
[55:20] it's word word word word word and and
[55:23] then of course the pentecostal side of
[55:25] the message were
[55:26] uh where they're you know where their
[55:28] own feelings and
[55:30] and sensationalism and you know numbers
[55:33] and
[55:34] you know emotion that goes with it you
[55:36] know of of water and they got a lot of
[55:38] faith but they don't know who they are
[55:41] and so brother branham said it's uh like
[55:43] money a man had money in the bank that
[55:46] and but couldn't write a check and one
[55:48] who had to write a check
[55:50] but had no money in the bank he said if
[55:52] you can just get them together so
[55:54] i think we got to see there's a third
[55:56] group out there
[55:58] amen there's got to be a third troop not
[56:00] just over here in fanaticism
[56:02] and not just word word word word where
[56:04] we become scholars and intellectuals but
[56:06] somewhere
[56:07] that have the word with faith and power
[56:12] amen now so again
[56:15] he said that that he said he was asked
[56:18] about the pentecostal so what makes him
[56:20] act like that he said
[56:22] well they were you know they just got
[56:25] some steam and they're having to get
[56:27] some bent somewhere
[56:29] you know but but if you they could
[56:31] direct it fundamentally in the word
[56:34] then the big regime of god would start
[56:37] moving on
[56:39] so he said there's where satan got in to
[56:41] make it all mechanics
[56:43] and no dynamics are back all dynamics
[56:47] and no mechanics and so we got to put it
[56:50] together we got to get the spirit of god
[56:52] but we got to come back to the with the
[56:54] word to feed this machine
[56:57] we can't feed it on creed that's man's
[57:00] ideas and self-interpretations to the
[57:02] message
[57:03] it won't burn it chokes up the flues it
[57:06] will not burn it it was
[57:07] made for the word of god and man shall
[57:11] not live by bread alone but by
[57:13] every word not just a part of it but
[57:16] every word that proceedeth out of the
[57:18] mouth of god
[57:19] so you know again it's it's not
[57:23] as brother branham said this is the
[57:25] resurrection
[57:26] power is not about ceremonies and easter
[57:29] bunnies and
[57:30] fictions and jumps and shouts
[57:33] and imaginations and and and all of that
[57:36] but he said all of that will fail and
[57:39] pass away
[57:41] until the church becomes both the
[57:44] dynamics
[57:45] and the mechanics and the spirit of god
[57:48] that moved him to do the same
[57:49] the things that he did if he hit on 16
[57:53] cylinders so will the bride amen for he
[57:56] said john 14
[57:57] 12 he that believeth on me the what
[58:00] shall i do
[58:01] shall he do also amen i'll give him a
[58:04] charge of my dynamics and his mechanics
[58:07] that the world will not be able to
[58:09] withstand
[58:10] it and i'll raise him up at the last day
[58:13] that's the easter message how many knows
[58:16] we have the easter message
[58:19] it is the rising of the sun amen shalom
[58:22] there's a
[58:23] new day about to dawn amen the first one
[58:27] from the dead
[58:28] out of all the dark denominationalism
[58:31] now there's a bride standing on her feet
[58:34] are you with me who is in the power of
[58:37] his resurrection
[58:39] showing forth resurrection signs he says
[58:42] that's the eastern message the dynamics
[58:45] and the mechanics
[58:46] together amen the mechanics without the
[58:49] dynamics
[58:50] no good i just want to say today
[58:55] across the nation and right here
[58:57] mechanics
[58:58] without the dynamics no good
[59:02] and he said neither is that dynamics
[59:04] without mechanics
[59:06] you can scream and shout and jump up and
[59:08] down all you want to
[59:10] and then deny this word it won't do any
[59:12] good you're just cranking around on the
[59:14] pistons
[59:15] got the spark there to fire but no
[59:17] gasoline to fire it by
[59:20] it'll only work as they come together
[59:24] so one will sit still and the other will
[59:27] go
[59:27] up well i don't know about you i don't
[59:30] want to be in the one the body that sits
[59:32] still
[59:33] i want to see it drive as it did in
[59:36] brother brennan's ministry
[59:38] and drive you down to healing and drive
[59:40] you down to salvation
[59:42] and drive you to a resurrection and
[59:44] drive us to a rapture
[59:48] amen but it'll take dynamics and
[59:50] mechanics
[59:52] we can't get out of balance in this age
[59:55] it only works as they come together yet
[59:58] both he said
[59:59] um they might look alike both claims to
[1:00:01] be churches both claim to be the bride
[1:00:04] but one has a mechanic and the dynamics
[1:00:06] it brings it to pass
[1:00:08] of what he said is the truth it just
[1:00:10] won't move no matter how
[1:00:11] good the mechanics is and we've tried it
[1:00:15] you know we got the greek and we we got
[1:00:18] seal one and seal two and seal ten
[1:00:20] and seal up 15 and still 115 and
[1:00:24] and on and on and on you know all of
[1:00:26] this teaching teaching teaching teaching
[1:00:29] it is about the time to preach the
[1:00:30] gospel
[1:00:32] to preach it means to demonstrate it
[1:00:35] [Applause]
[1:00:37] preaching this and just jumping out and
[1:00:38] down and hollering and screaming
[1:00:40] preaching is demonstrating
[1:00:42] the gospel
[1:00:46] it ain't how we deliver the message it's
[1:00:48] how it works
[1:00:51] god's got different ways of delivering
[1:00:52] it depending on how he made the man
[1:00:55] but he said well but again he says it
[1:00:58] just won't move no matter how good the
[1:01:00] mechanics is
[1:01:01] until the dynamics come when the
[1:01:04] dynamics come the fire is made to
[1:01:06] connect with that octane
[1:01:08] in the gasoline and when that explodes
[1:01:11] it causes a
[1:01:12] combustion and combustion moves every
[1:01:15] motion
[1:01:16] every move for he's the same yesterday
[1:01:19] today and forever that's the
[1:01:20] resurrection
[1:01:21] that's the real power of god mechanics
[1:01:25] with the dynamics notice it's the spirit
[1:01:28] that quickens
[1:01:29] it's the spark the fires it's not the
[1:01:32] gas that fires
[1:01:33] it's the spark that fires the gas
[1:01:36] amen as he says and once more there
[1:01:39] ought to be a holy power
[1:01:41] surrounding and in that church that will
[1:01:44] make demons flee
[1:01:46] instead of that it's become a
[1:01:48] laughingstock what is it
[1:01:50] mechanics instead of dynamics
[1:01:56] amen now
[1:01:59] you know he said why the church again
[1:02:02] when their eyes were open
[1:02:03] 64 why the church ought to be white
[1:02:05] ought to be in its most
[1:02:06] glorious stage now and the power of his
[1:02:10] resurrection
[1:02:11] great signs and wonders so if you're
[1:02:13] wondering
[1:02:14] what's prophesied for this hour there it
[1:02:16] is
[1:02:17] amen testimony on the sea he said
[1:02:20] we can begin to find out miracles isn't
[1:02:23] taking place anymore
[1:02:25] like they were and the sick goes home
[1:02:27] sick
[1:02:28] it isn't because of god it's because of
[1:02:31] the lack of revival among the people
[1:02:34] there's no revival to sit and listen and
[1:02:36] go home and say well
[1:02:37] guess that was pretty good uh-huh and
[1:02:39] there's not that zeal
[1:02:42] and there's not that something in the
[1:02:44] people that should be there
[1:02:48] amen now there are these truth thoughts
[1:02:52] that brother branham wove back back and
[1:02:55] forth and in her wove
[1:02:57] um after the seals and actually he
[1:02:59] touched on it some even in his own
[1:03:01] church
[1:03:02] but one thought was that of samson which
[1:03:05] we preached about last week
[1:03:07] and the others were the other thought
[1:03:10] was in
[1:03:10] be not afraid and testimony on the sea
[1:03:13] go awake jesus
[1:03:15] then jesus came and called different
[1:03:17] sermons like that
[1:03:20] and and so he
[1:03:23] these were these were types because
[1:03:26] remember
[1:03:27] they were foreshadowing another age to
[1:03:29] come what was done in the groom
[1:03:31] must also be done in the bride so
[1:03:35] we we can see some of these things there
[1:03:38] as as um that he dealt with
[1:03:41] where the disciples were between
[1:03:44] revivals
[1:03:46] there had been a great revival and they
[1:03:48] were testifying
[1:03:50] of the past some had
[1:03:53] jesus asleep in the boat
[1:03:56] and others had gone off without him
[1:04:00] so you had two groups of people some
[1:04:02] actually had
[1:04:03] jesus but he was asleep
[1:04:06] and the others didn't have him at all
[1:04:09] but had went off without him
[1:04:12] amen as i read this text and i'm hearing
[1:04:14] him tell him
[1:04:15] go there you know go and leave me here
[1:04:18] and go and i'd say
[1:04:19] i ain't never leaving you jesus
[1:04:23] if you ain't in this boat i ain't
[1:04:24] getting in it
[1:04:28] and that's the way we got to look in
[1:04:29] this hour you know if you're not in my
[1:04:31] life
[1:04:31] i don't want another moment if you're
[1:04:34] not really in my heart
[1:04:36] deep in my soul amen that seal under the
[1:04:38] day of redemption
[1:04:40] i don't want another moment without it i
[1:04:42] must have it
[1:04:46] amen amen and of course there was the
[1:04:50] thought of samson crying
[1:04:52] just once more lord brother branham
[1:04:56] preached the sermon on samson
[1:04:58] as the present state of the church i
[1:05:00] didn't aim at that he did
[1:05:02] said this is where we're at amen
[1:05:06] and he said and he preached that to his
[1:05:08] own church as
[1:05:09] a deceived church by the world
[1:05:12] and the and he warned his own church
[1:05:15] about being
[1:05:16] blinded and defeated and becoming scared
[1:05:20] of the new birth
[1:05:23] and he would say in the world is falling
[1:05:26] apart in 63 of november
[1:05:28] it seems like a drying out of the
[1:05:30] churches can hardly find a church
[1:05:32] anymore
[1:05:33] that's alive with the word with the
[1:05:36] spirit and the spirit of god
[1:05:38] and great things taking place like it
[1:05:40] was not long ago
[1:05:43] think of that he's looking
[1:05:46] at the church and he says i hardly can
[1:05:49] find one
[1:05:50] that's got both
[1:05:53] i mean i i'm not i'm not standing here
[1:05:55] with my chest out
[1:05:57] i'm not standing here as a bracket i am
[1:06:00] approaching this just like this god
[1:06:02] i want both of them i'm not satisfied
[1:06:06] with one or the other
[1:06:09] i want to see this word and the spirit
[1:06:12] work together
[1:06:13] the dynamics and the mechanics
[1:06:16] amen i i'm not standing here and
[1:06:19] gloating and saying we're the only ones
[1:06:20] that got it we're this and without i'm
[1:06:22] not
[1:06:23] i need to put off your bracket we have
[1:06:25] no right to brag
[1:06:26] if we got anything at all it's the grace
[1:06:28] of
[1:06:31] but god tell you what you ought to have
[1:06:33] an utmost desire in your heart
[1:06:35] god in my life i want it i want that
[1:06:39] revival in my soul
[1:06:41] i don't want to be left here in
[1:06:43] lethargic
[1:06:44] dead hopeless laodicea
[1:06:48] that's just lukewarm about it
[1:06:56] you know brother bratton would look at
[1:06:58] it
[1:06:59] and he could say i see one hope
[1:07:06] this is what he said to his own church
[1:07:08] deceived church by the worlds where he
[1:07:10] first preached us at
[1:07:12] you say oh this don't apply to brother
[1:07:14] branham's movement in the brother
[1:07:16] brandon's church oh yes it does
[1:07:18] he preached it first there and he says
[1:07:22] he says there is here's the only hope
[1:07:25] that i have this morning to wind up my
[1:07:27] message while
[1:07:29] simpson was bound a new shock of hair
[1:07:31] growed out
[1:07:34] who wants to be that new sock of hair
[1:07:38] amen not blinded and defeated but a
[1:07:41] people with renewed power
[1:07:43] who are restored church like what's
[1:07:46] promising the word to be
[1:07:48] and he says that the power of the holy
[1:07:51] ghost can come in her
[1:07:52] into demonstration of the spirits and
[1:07:55] mark 16
[1:07:56] will can follow the church acts 2 4 acts
[1:07:59] 2 38
[1:08:00] will all of it will be fallen right
[1:08:02] along with the church
[1:08:03] signs and wonders accompanied the
[1:08:05] apostles great signs of his resurrection
[1:08:08] accompanied them
[1:08:09] and while we're in prison surely god's
[1:08:11] growing a crop somewhere
[1:08:13] for the last great kill
[1:08:18] i mean he's ready for a final blow to
[1:08:20] the devil
[1:08:22] well it's going to take a complete dine
[1:08:24] out on our part
[1:08:27] amen and he said i trust
[1:08:30] message will will help bring the vitamin
[1:08:33] to your system
[1:08:34] that'll grow as spiritual power back in
[1:08:36] your life again
[1:08:40] now again you know
[1:08:43] as he would say in testimony on the sea
[1:08:46] another 64
[1:08:47] sermon i'm saying this on purpose
[1:08:49] because of those who say
[1:08:51] well we can't accept nothing after 63
[1:08:53] well here's 64.
[1:08:55] we've gone off without the old-time
[1:08:57] prayer meetings
[1:08:59] and the baptism of the holy ghost coming
[1:09:01] back until the fire
[1:09:02] has burnt low you just can't
[1:09:06] point back to the denominations there we
[1:09:08] got to look inward
[1:09:11] all of us around the world you cry out
[1:09:14] and
[1:09:14] try to get people to the altar and no we
[1:09:16] don't do that no more we don't have
[1:09:18] altar calls
[1:09:19] that's even worse it shows ichabod is
[1:09:22] wrote over me
[1:09:23] i'll read you the quote in a minute they
[1:09:25] just woke up and they were almost
[1:09:27] dead a dread to come and and and then
[1:09:30] ask ministers to come pray with them and
[1:09:32] oh why did he ask me for ministers
[1:09:35] and they get down you can't hardly get
[1:09:37] them and then they stand there for a few
[1:09:39] minutes and look up at you and go back
[1:09:41] to
[1:09:41] sit down to their seats to me the fire
[1:09:44] has gone out
[1:09:46] something has happened look what we need
[1:09:48] is a revival
[1:09:51] that sinners looking upon christ repent
[1:09:54] and run to the altar with their hands up
[1:09:56] and screaming for mercy
[1:09:58] and the whole church is a flame of fire
[1:10:00] with the glory of god
[1:10:03] again in jehovah jireh he was he
[1:10:07] he would talk about the altar calls i
[1:10:09] said i believe god's going to do some
[1:10:11] great things and that's the reason i
[1:10:13] have altar calls
[1:10:14] and do everything i can to find favor
[1:10:16] with him now watch
[1:10:18] remember this title god's provided way
[1:10:21] for this day
[1:10:22] 1964 sermon god's provided way for what
[1:10:28] this day hear it
[1:10:31] for this day amen he says
[1:10:35] they have never found a better way for a
[1:10:37] baby to give what it wants
[1:10:39] than to cry for it would you give him a
[1:10:42] bell and say junior you're only three
[1:10:44] days over them
[1:10:45] now when you want to do it when you want
[1:10:47] your bottle
[1:10:48] raise this bell up and ring it it just
[1:10:50] won't work
[1:10:52] the baby cries for what is won't that's
[1:10:55] what god's provided away
[1:10:57] the louder you cry he said don't whip
[1:10:58] the little fella he's the only he's only
[1:11:01] following god's provided way
[1:11:03] he wants something that's right it's the
[1:11:05] only way he knows
[1:11:06] is to call his mother scream for it cry
[1:11:10] for it
[1:11:10] that's right remember god's provided way
[1:11:13] for this day
[1:11:14] god recommends this for his children
[1:11:20] hallelujah god recommends this for his
[1:11:24] believing children
[1:11:26] [Music]
[1:11:28] he did not not in a he
[1:11:31] not intellectual speeches not some great
[1:11:34] theology to
[1:11:35] theology that treats he wants you to cry
[1:11:38] for your needs
[1:11:40] that's right cry for it you're too stiff
[1:11:42] and starchy
[1:11:43] you'll never get it if you if you see if
[1:11:46] you're ready to limber yourself
[1:11:48] up for a little a little and cry god
[1:11:50] will give it to you he likes
[1:11:52] to hear his children cry
[1:11:55] cry your needs to god god wants it
[1:11:58] that's his provided way
[1:11:59] cry out for it that's the way the baby
[1:12:01] cries that's the way he wants
[1:12:02] you to cry cry how long how long does a
[1:12:06] baby cry
[1:12:07] till he gets satisfied and that's the
[1:12:09] way the believing christians should do
[1:12:11] god's child if you see god made a
[1:12:14] promise
[1:12:15] don't give up on it cry till it's
[1:12:20] answered
[1:12:23] amen roger you see god vindicates this
[1:12:26] word
[1:12:26] and when god vindicates his word and
[1:12:28] proves it here then you don't have to
[1:12:30] cry no more
[1:12:32] amen you got it you walk away and thank
[1:12:34] him for it but until you do scream out
[1:12:36] till you get it
[1:12:38] i like that persistent holding on not a
[1:12:41] hybrid plant not one that has to be
[1:12:42] babied and petted and packed around
[1:12:44] christians are real genuine born again
[1:12:47] articles of god
[1:12:48] they fight for their position
[1:12:51] and that's what all this crying is about
[1:12:53] you're fighting for your position
[1:12:56] brother brother of jesus rather likened
[1:12:59] us
[1:12:59] liking himself that god is the unjust
[1:13:02] judge which is not unjust
[1:13:04] but he likened it and the and the
[1:13:06] approach
[1:13:07] to him and how to approach him
[1:13:10] hey man she and he said she cries
[1:13:13] day and night and he said because of her
[1:13:17] continual coming
[1:13:19] [Applause]
[1:13:21] i'm going to answer her
[1:13:24] and if you want something from god you
[1:13:26] got to be persistent
[1:13:28] you cannot ever give up on it you begin
[1:13:31] to cry you can
[1:13:33] knock and keep on knocking and you ask
[1:13:35] and you keep on asking
[1:13:37] and you seek and you keep on seeking
[1:13:39] [Applause]
[1:13:42] remember remember the very sign of those
[1:13:45] that are sealed which brother branham
[1:13:47] said you
[1:13:47] you can't preach this you hurt your
[1:13:49] church but he said one of the greatest
[1:13:51] signs of people being sealed
[1:13:53] is they're signing crying for the
[1:13:55] abominations
[1:13:59] that are being done yes
[1:14:02] i wonder if today if we hadn't become a
[1:14:05] bit
[1:14:06] calloused with all that we hear
[1:14:12] i don't know who she is but we're right
[1:14:15] here
[1:14:17] you know where the vice president rising
[1:14:19] up
[1:14:20] could be rising up in america
[1:14:25] she's not black she's an indian
[1:14:28] on her mother's side on her daddy's side
[1:14:31] she's haitian which is white and black
[1:14:34] and she identifies as an afro-american
[1:14:37] and she's not
[1:14:42] are you with me i remember but she's an
[1:14:44] evil woman
[1:14:47] she's a cruel woman and here she's
[1:14:51] coming up
[1:14:53] i don't know what our next election will
[1:14:55] be
[1:14:56] but don't think things are going to get
[1:14:58] better
[1:15:02] it's all playing in the hands of god
[1:15:06] we're right here on the fulfillment of
[1:15:08] prophecy
[1:15:11] and you you've got to fight for your
[1:15:14] position
[1:15:15] and when i begin the year out with
[1:15:18] joshua you know what joshua
[1:15:20] said it was told you know put your feet
[1:15:22] on the promise
[1:15:24] i won't fail you i won't leave you i'll
[1:15:27] be right there like i was with moses
[1:15:31] like i was with the messenger i'll be
[1:15:33] with you
[1:15:34] you're going to take this land you're
[1:15:36] going to go into the rapture
[1:15:40] but you got to be persistent
[1:15:45] that was another sermon that he kept
[1:15:47] preaching
[1:15:48] perseverance don't give up
[1:15:53] lay hold on it that's why jacob you know
[1:15:56] was known as
[1:15:57] jacob he he come out as the heel grabber
[1:16:00] he had a hold of his brother's heel
[1:16:03] my mind from the first floor as he came
[1:16:05] out his hand
[1:16:06] was wrapped around that's the way you've
[1:16:08] got to be a heel grabber
[1:16:10] amen i'm going to get a hold that
[1:16:12] promise i don't care how
[1:16:15] amen i'm going to get it come on and
[1:16:17] that was jacob no matter what he had to
[1:16:19] do no matter
[1:16:20] what what kind of things he had to go
[1:16:22] through he was going to get it
[1:16:29] so you have to come with determination
[1:16:33] come until you know you just stay there
[1:16:35] till you know it's over
[1:16:37] amen if you knock and you come once well
[1:16:40] i've been to the altar before well come
[1:16:43] again
[1:16:44] amen and don't just wait for church find
[1:16:47] an altar wherever you're
[1:16:48] at amen if you're in the woods if you're
[1:16:52] at work if you're in school
[1:16:54] wherever you are you seek that altar
[1:16:57] until your life is changed
[1:16:59] can be in the jail wherever it is you
[1:17:02] find an altar
[1:17:07] you cry till you get it i was so
[1:17:10] overjoyed the other day when some come
[1:17:12] down to the altars and
[1:17:13] i didn't even ask and sisters came and
[1:17:16] prayed with the sister and brother came
[1:17:18] and prayed with the brothers it
[1:17:20] overjoyed me to see
[1:17:22] those who joined with those seekers
[1:17:26] and brother branham said in jehovah
[1:17:27] jireh he says
[1:17:29] he said i want to say this about you
[1:17:31] people here that proves what you're made
[1:17:33] of i went to places
[1:17:35] even and people who's supposed to be
[1:17:37] spirit-filled people
[1:17:39] and see altar calls made and while you
[1:17:41] couldn't get people to go in and pray
[1:17:43] with anybody
[1:17:44] to pray with me it shows it's ichabod
[1:17:47] the spirit of the lord has departed but
[1:17:50] when you see that zeal and fire
[1:17:53] and longing and long for human souls
[1:17:58] so i want you to say something if it's
[1:18:01] ichabod
[1:18:03] for people you know let a soul come to
[1:18:06] the altar
[1:18:06] and nobody want to pray with him and
[1:18:09] that shows the zychabot
[1:18:11] then wouldn't it also be ichabod when we
[1:18:13] got preachers who won't make an altar
[1:18:15] call
[1:18:20] amen isn't it it kebab when an
[1:18:23] atmosphere isn't made in the church
[1:18:27] where sinners get out of their sheep and
[1:18:29] weep their way to calgary
[1:18:32] isn't that ichabod the glory has
[1:18:34] departed
[1:18:36] that's what ichabod means
[1:18:42] you remember it was in the it was in the
[1:18:46] in the in the days
[1:18:48] of samuel where eli had sent out the ark
[1:18:51] with for the battle
[1:18:53] against the philistines and the ark was
[1:18:55] taken
[1:18:56] that represents the word is taken down
[1:18:59] the camp of the enemy
[1:19:02] and there his daughter-in-law was giving
[1:19:04] birth about that time
[1:19:06] and she gave birth she died and as she
[1:19:09] died she named the child that was born
[1:19:11] ichabod
[1:19:12] the glory of the lord has departed
[1:19:15] because the ark of the lord is taken
[1:19:19] and when the word in his power leaves a
[1:19:22] church
[1:19:23] leaves a movement come on amen it shows
[1:19:27] the glory of the lord has departed
[1:19:29] when there's no more zeal no and there's
[1:19:32] no more desire to see a soul say
[1:19:34] when they're not people calling on god
[1:19:38] then you can see the glory of the lord
[1:19:40] has departed
[1:19:44] and he said we've gone off without the
[1:19:46] old-time prayer meeting the baptism of
[1:19:47] the holy ghost coming back to the fire
[1:19:49] that went low until there's this dread
[1:19:56] dread for even people to come up
[1:19:58] ministers won't even pray
[1:20:01] and he said there there again
[1:20:04] he says as an evangelist
[1:20:07] he talked about it in spiritual amnesia
[1:20:10] he said we actually get enough god about
[1:20:12] us
[1:20:13] till we come up the platform said yeah i
[1:20:15] better come up and
[1:20:16] you know now this is experience of
[1:20:18] worldwide he said this is not unique to
[1:20:21] this one place in birmingham but he said
[1:20:24] i better go up and stand well i don't
[1:20:26] know here i am
[1:20:27] um what a place to be in there's no fire
[1:20:30] burning there's no enthusiasm
[1:20:32] there's no go into it and as an
[1:20:35] evangelist
[1:20:36] that it kills me to see god's people in
[1:20:38] that shape but we're supposed to be on
[1:20:40] fire
[1:20:42] but you see what it is exactly what i
[1:20:44] told you revelation 3
[1:20:45] you're lukewarm and he said because
[1:20:47] you're lukewarm i'm gonna spew out my
[1:20:49] mouth that's right
[1:20:50] what do you what that's what he said and
[1:20:53] if he said that's what he's gonna do
[1:20:55] let's not be in that crowd you're here
[1:20:58] needy let's get it or die right here
[1:21:01] that's right let's get it or die and
[1:21:05] that's got to be the
[1:21:06] the attitude of every one of us and
[1:21:09] every repentant sinner
[1:21:11] i must get it or die
[1:21:18] as vernon winters died here the other
[1:21:21] day
[1:21:22] with cancer and he said i know what i
[1:21:24] got this cancer
[1:21:26] he said the reason why is because i
[1:21:29] wouldn't surrender my heart to god
[1:21:31] and i'm so thankful for this cancer
[1:21:34] because in it god has given me an
[1:21:36] opportunity to come back and i would
[1:21:38] rather die
[1:21:39] with this cancer than to die an
[1:21:42] alcoholic
[1:21:45] i'd rather die with this cancer a
[1:21:48] christian
[1:21:49] than die an alcoholic a sinner
[1:21:54] god's to catch you amen
[1:21:59] you know there are truth thoughts
[1:22:04] that he presents he presents go away
[1:22:07] jesus or be not afraid to
[1:22:11] true condition one of them
[1:22:14] is a person or church who has jesus in
[1:22:18] the boat
[1:22:19] but just needs to rouse him with their
[1:22:22] faith
[1:22:25] and then the other is a person or church
[1:22:28] who has gone off without jesus
[1:22:33] and he's he's a he's afraid of the
[1:22:36] he's a very thing they need and they're
[1:22:38] afraid of it
[1:22:40] are you with me now again this is what
[1:22:43] brother branham said in 63
[1:22:46] in august he said he says what people do
[1:22:48] about coming to christ they lay the
[1:22:50] foundation
[1:22:50] of believing on the lord and accept him
[1:22:52] as a personal savior
[1:22:54] and going on to christian baptism but
[1:22:57] when it comes on to fallen through to
[1:22:58] the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:23:00] somebody explains them away from that's
[1:23:04] the reason it's seed that fell by the
[1:23:05] wayside or
[1:23:06] fell on stony ground or shall i say fell
[1:23:09] among thorns
[1:23:12] now we re we read
[1:23:15] and we shared with you from the deceived
[1:23:17] church by the world and brother branham
[1:23:19] told his church
[1:23:20] you are afraid of the new birth
[1:23:24] and i'm just saying this is what has
[1:23:26] happened seemingly around
[1:23:28] around the the whole movement the
[1:23:30] message community
[1:23:31] they got to where they're afraid of the
[1:23:33] new birth
[1:23:35] amen they're afraid of the gifts of the
[1:23:36] spirit
[1:23:38] they want nothing to do with that wow
[1:23:40] they might be called pentecostal
[1:23:43] i hope i am called pentecostal
[1:23:46] because somebody's going to be a true
[1:23:48] pentecostal
[1:23:50] they're going to be the acts 2
[1:23:51] pentecostal
[1:23:53] amen not this latter day azusa street
[1:23:56] but the one whose hearts have been
[1:23:58] turned back to the original faith of the
[1:24:01] fathers
[1:24:02] and brother branham sent himself in the
[1:24:04] laodicean church age i want to be that
[1:24:06] kind of pentecostal
[1:24:07] from the top of my head to the soles of
[1:24:09] my feet
[1:24:11] and there ought to be a people here
[1:24:12] today that said god
[1:24:14] make me like that original branch
[1:24:17] let me be a part of that not an
[1:24:20] impersonator but a part of that
[1:24:22] where there's a branch is a part the
[1:24:24] offshoot from the mind the original root
[1:24:27] and i'm bringing forth the life of
[1:24:29] christ as the apostles did
[1:24:32] and write another book of acts behind us
[1:24:36] and let me remind you the book of acts
[1:24:38] that we're writing is not all the
[1:24:39] quarrels and the fussing and the
[1:24:41] fighting and the failures
[1:24:42] the book of acts that is promised to us
[1:24:45] is the
[1:24:46] very things that jesus did you shall do
[1:24:49] also
[1:24:50] that the life that was in jesus is in
[1:24:53] his bride are you with me
[1:24:54] amen oh yeah they're afraid they might
[1:24:57] speak with tongues
[1:24:58] what paul said i would that you always
[1:25:00] speak with tongues
[1:25:02] but rather that you prophesy but then
[1:25:05] of course i prophet told us he said some
[1:25:07] people won't receive it unless they do
[1:25:09] speak with tongues
[1:25:10] and he said god's a good god he'll give
[1:25:12] you what you want
[1:25:13] but you can have tongues without the
[1:25:15] holy ghost why don't you just get the
[1:25:16] holy ghost and then he'll give you
[1:25:18] everything else you need
[1:25:21] amen amen
[1:25:25] and then become afraid of the anointing
[1:25:29] because
[1:25:31] we might be branded as the anointed ones
[1:25:34] at the end time
[1:25:37] well i hope i'm branded as that
[1:25:44] i didn't say i want to be branded as
[1:25:47] the anointed false ones but i want to be
[1:25:50] one of those that's anointed
[1:25:53] because the bride is the anointed one to
[1:25:55] this day
[1:25:56] hold on amen again in the shame brother
[1:26:00] brandon said
[1:26:01] this is in 65 before he parts he said
[1:26:04] instead
[1:26:05] of accepting the fatherhood of the word
[1:26:07] now he
[1:26:08] he says recognizing the word is our
[1:26:10] father
[1:26:12] and he said it would be a shame you know
[1:26:14] if your boy walks in and you say
[1:26:16] hey this is my son and you say my son
[1:26:19] huh no you're not my dad something that
[1:26:22] ugly can't be mine
[1:26:25] how would you feel as a father your
[1:26:28] daughter deny you right in the face of
[1:26:31] your company your friends
[1:26:34] strangers and he said when it comes to
[1:26:37] accepting the fatherhood of the word of
[1:26:39] god
[1:26:39] christ no they're embarrassed
[1:26:43] they don't want to say yes i have spoken
[1:26:46] tongues
[1:26:48] yes i have seen visions
[1:26:51] yes i believe in divine healing yes
[1:26:54] i praise the lord i was with brother ron
[1:26:58] here
[1:26:58] in a meeting back june of a few years
[1:27:01] ago and
[1:27:02] and and he talked about seeing the
[1:27:04] vision and whatever some woman come
[1:27:07] running up to him after that only
[1:27:08] brother branham could have visions
[1:27:12] and i thought we
[1:27:16] we supposed to be in the message 40 50
[1:27:19] years and we're so immature
[1:27:22] that we don't know that sons and
[1:27:23] daughters of god shall see visions old
[1:27:25] men shall see dreams
[1:27:27] and young men see visions and i pour out
[1:27:31] my spirit upon all flesh
[1:27:36] amen and ashamed of him he said but let
[1:27:40] me say this a man who has once come in
[1:27:42] contact with god
[1:27:43] which is the word and the word has been
[1:27:45] made plain and manifested
[1:27:47] there's no shameless about it you're not
[1:27:49] embarrassed
[1:27:50] it don't embarrass me to say i believe
[1:27:52] every word of god
[1:27:53] it don't embarrass me to say when the
[1:27:55] lord says say
[1:27:56] any say anything you go and say and do
[1:27:59] it it don't embarrass me to say i've
[1:28:01] been filled with the holy ghost
[1:28:02] it don't embarrass me to say that i have
[1:28:04] spoke with other tongues
[1:28:06] it don't embarrass me to say that our
[1:28:08] lord has shown me vision
[1:28:09] it don't embarrass me to say he's the
[1:28:12] same yesterday today and forever
[1:28:21] we don't like this title
[1:28:25] that i'm fixing to share with you and we
[1:28:28] want to deny it and spit it out as a
[1:28:31] as a movement as a message community
[1:28:36] but listen your prophet in 63
[1:28:41] november 30th the sickest
[1:28:45] body i know of
[1:28:49] is the so-called body of jesus christ
[1:28:55] it needs spiritual healing
[1:28:59] and there's only one bomb that i know
[1:29:01] that will heal
[1:29:02] and that's the word and that's the sick
[1:29:05] body that we want to stand up and
[1:29:07] strengthen the vitamin power of the
[1:29:08] gospel
[1:29:10] and that's why i use much of the time
[1:29:12] now trying to strengthen the church
[1:29:14] by the word and that's exactly where
[1:29:18] we're at today remember there's too many
[1:29:21] sick among us
[1:29:23] because they have not discerned the
[1:29:25] lord's body
[1:29:26] are you with me now as we as we speak of
[1:29:29] it as he says
[1:29:30] you know he says i'm not trying to
[1:29:32] support my ignorance he goes on to say
[1:29:34] by saying this
[1:29:35] but what we need now more that we need
[1:29:39] that we do the intellectual side to know
[1:29:41] how to put the word together
[1:29:43] and how to make it masterly fit is god
[1:29:46] we need god see it doesn't come
[1:29:50] always come through rightly formed words
[1:29:53] it comes through dedicated heart and
[1:29:55] that heart dedicated god
[1:29:57] and doing the will of god now you've got
[1:29:59] to know the will before you can do the
[1:30:01] will
[1:30:01] but find out what you're here for and
[1:30:04] that's the whole thing come to yourself
[1:30:06] realize what you're here for amen what
[1:30:10] is the church
[1:30:11] raised up for what would samson raise up
[1:30:13] to destroy god's enemy
[1:30:15] [Applause]
[1:30:16] and what have we been raised up for to
[1:30:18] defeat the enemy
[1:30:20] that the gates of hell cannot prevail
[1:30:22] against us
[1:30:24] to be a church who stands in this last
[1:30:26] day
[1:30:28] and not fall for anything and everything
[1:30:32] now
[1:30:36] i'll spend enough time on that
[1:30:40] i want to go into my thought
[1:30:47] here they're out on the sea
[1:30:51] they just had a great revival
[1:30:54] i'm just referencing what brother
[1:30:57] branham preached
[1:30:59] and he said it might have been the young
[1:31:01] john
[1:31:03] that hadn't had his heart so scarred
[1:31:07] with so much theology
[1:31:14] you know i think it's going to take some
[1:31:15] young john's in this day
[1:31:18] whose hearts ain't so scarred
[1:31:21] with so much theology
[1:31:25] you know well until we've explained the
[1:31:27] power of god away and
[1:31:29] we've expanded flame divine and healing
[1:31:31] we don't need it's a minor you know well
[1:31:34] hey you can't have the major without the
[1:31:36] miner
[1:31:38] what we you know we the gifts will be
[1:31:40] that that's pentecost so you know
[1:31:42] jumping down jumping up and down and
[1:31:44] trying to speak with tongues
[1:31:46] is over with now brother tim and i agree
[1:31:50] jumping up and down and trying to speak
[1:31:52] with tongues is over with
[1:31:54] trying to manufacture a gift and trying
[1:31:56] to work up a motion
[1:31:58] is over with i agree wholeheartedly
[1:32:01] well you know we got the divine now
[1:32:04] perfect interpretation of the word
[1:32:07] and when when that which is which is um
[1:32:11] which is perfect has come then that
[1:32:15] which in part is done away with
[1:32:18] and i want to say i so concur and i so
[1:32:21] agree that we're here at a time that
[1:32:24] when just
[1:32:24] having part is over with
[1:32:28] and you cannot have the perfect and a
[1:32:30] part left out
[1:32:32] so in the perfect has to be gifts of the
[1:32:35] spirit
[1:32:36] tongues interpretation divine healing
[1:32:38] the power of god come on
[1:32:41] amen it's got to be there
[1:32:44] to have that which is perfect because
[1:32:48] when that which is perfect it's come
[1:32:49] then then
[1:32:50] just having part is done away with
[1:32:54] you get a man sealed with the holy ghost
[1:32:56] down on the inside of the inside
[1:32:59] he might have lived with part as a
[1:33:01] justification
[1:33:02] he might have had another part with
[1:33:04] sanctification
[1:33:05] but when are you with me amen when he is
[1:33:09] filled in his soul
[1:33:10] and is redeemed come on and that seed is
[1:33:13] quickened on the inside of him
[1:33:15] then just having part of salvation is
[1:33:19] over with
[1:33:20] now the fullness has come and love
[1:33:23] his fullness we have received grace for
[1:33:26] grace
[1:33:31] you know your heart gets scarred with
[1:33:34] theology you're only concerned with
[1:33:37] theology
[1:33:38] i believe the message we believe the
[1:33:40] thunders
[1:33:42] we got the seals we do the book is open
[1:33:46] oh we believe in his coming the epiphany
[1:33:49] the perugia
[1:33:51] we believe this we believe that but when
[1:33:53] your heart isn't scarred
[1:33:56] then instead of thinking oh i'm so glad
[1:33:59] and i've got this comfort
[1:34:01] oh that i've got the certain theology
[1:34:04] and i got this certain
[1:34:06] knowledge of this revelation but you're
[1:34:09] thankful instead for his life
[1:34:11] and his power within you
[1:34:14] are you with me amen and he said john
[1:34:17] hadn't had
[1:34:18] his heart so scarred with so much
[1:34:20] theology he must have said something
[1:34:22] like this
[1:34:23] think of it right here in the ship
[1:34:28] this one that is identified by jehovah's
[1:34:31] word
[1:34:31] to be jehovah's service and servant in
[1:34:34] whom he is pleased
[1:34:36] is right here in this ship with us
[1:34:41] come on somebody amen there ought to be
[1:34:44] some of us not so scarred with theology
[1:34:47] until they're still rejoicing we can
[1:34:50] still
[1:34:51] shout and rejoice and say there's god in
[1:34:54] this ship
[1:34:56] it's not just theology there's really
[1:34:59] god in this ship
[1:35:00] i know he changed me he made me
[1:35:04] different
[1:35:05] amen oh there'll be a church so we can
[1:35:08] say
[1:35:08] we got god in this ship
[1:35:10] [Applause]
[1:35:12] not just theology but god's in this ship
[1:35:18] the great creator the almighty
[1:35:23] and you're thankful for his life and his
[1:35:25] power
[1:35:27] because as brother branham said and who
[1:35:29] is this not to know theology is life
[1:35:32] not to know the bible is life but to
[1:35:36] know him as life
[1:35:37] to know him as your personal savior as
[1:35:40] the one
[1:35:41] who has filled you with his presence you
[1:35:43] were there when it happened
[1:35:46] hallelujah how many can say this morning
[1:35:48] i was there
[1:35:49] when it happened amen and there's nobody
[1:35:52] can take it away from you
[1:35:53] there's no one can explain it away from
[1:35:56] you when that experience has
[1:35:58] happens to you you know who he is to me
[1:36:01] he's
[1:36:01] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:36:04] and forever
[1:36:08] as brother branham said god called
[1:36:10] ministers ought not to be stuffed
[1:36:13] so stuffed out with theology but have
[1:36:15] visited the land
[1:36:16] to where we're going bringing back the
[1:36:19] evidence of
[1:36:20] the divine love and the power of jesus
[1:36:22] christ
[1:36:23] to make it known to their congregation
[1:36:26] that there
[1:36:26] is a land beyond the river
[1:36:31] so jesus is in our boat how many
[1:36:34] glad this morning jesus is in your boat
[1:36:38] amen my they they could look around
[1:36:41] and they could talk and say you know
[1:36:43] here he is
[1:36:45] the messiah here he is the anointed word
[1:36:49] here it is we saw the sign come down we
[1:36:52] heard the forerunner say
[1:36:53] this is my beloved son we heard
[1:36:57] the message that is john the baptist was
[1:37:00] sent before run the first coming
[1:37:02] you're sent with a message before run
[1:37:03] the second coming and that message is in
[1:37:06] the boat
[1:37:08] the very creator it created
[1:37:11] amen it resurrected fish come on
[1:37:13] somebody
[1:37:14] it created squirrels somebody helped me
[1:37:17] hey man it vanished tumors
[1:37:20] are you with me is say the young people
[1:37:23] come on somebody hey many calm storms
[1:37:27] i mean what was that the word was in our
[1:37:32] mix
[1:37:40] brother bradham said they had seen him
[1:37:43] out there healed the sick raise the dead
[1:37:44] for no
[1:37:46] things tell people the secrets of their
[1:37:48] hearts
[1:37:49] and believe they were on their road to
[1:37:51] another revival but then trouble
[1:37:53] set in and they forgot all about it
[1:37:58] they forgot when trouble came
[1:38:01] that jesus was really in their ship
[1:38:06] they began with every kind of
[1:38:07] self-effort they could
[1:38:09] they used their oars they pulled down
[1:38:11] the sails they did this they did that
[1:38:13] they
[1:38:14] they they hung onto the rudder till it
[1:38:16] breaks
[1:38:20] they do everything humanly possible
[1:38:24] and he said you know when trouble come
[1:38:26] in they forgot all about and he said
[1:38:28] that's the way we do
[1:38:29] he's still as great as he ever was
[1:38:32] hey man he's just still as great as he
[1:38:34] stood in space and said let there be
[1:38:37] and created the world he's just as great
[1:38:40] as he was when he was in the days of
[1:38:42] moses and open up the red sea
[1:38:44] he's as great as he was and so that the
[1:38:46] grave of lazarus
[1:38:48] when he said lives was come forth and if
[1:38:50] he hadn't said lazarus all the dead
[1:38:52] would have come forth
[1:38:53] he's as great as he was when he healed
[1:38:55] the leper when he raised up the
[1:38:57] when he opened up the eyes of the blind
[1:39:00] his power is not diminished his glory is
[1:39:04] not diminished
[1:39:06] amen his holy ghost still has
[1:39:08] omnipotence in it
[1:39:10] that can change your world in a second
[1:39:15] amen he's just as great as he was in the
[1:39:18] welsh revival
[1:39:19] he's as great as he was in azusa street
[1:39:22] he's as great as he was
[1:39:24] in the divine healing movement and he's
[1:39:26] still great
[1:39:27] right now this morning in 2020
[1:39:31] where we are seeing marijuana's
[1:39:41] but there's troubled waters the winds
[1:39:44] and the waves are blowing there's fusses
[1:39:46] and churches
[1:39:48] splits over nothing
[1:39:54] hurts and divisions and wounds
[1:40:03] fusses in the church some like this way
[1:40:06] somewhat that way something's divided
[1:40:09] over the music
[1:40:10] somebody divided over this and
[1:40:12] something's abided over that
[1:40:15] you know what your problem is you lost
[1:40:17] the vision
[1:40:19] the vision is jesus is in our ship
[1:40:24] but yet you're looking out here at all
[1:40:26] and letting satan blow you over
[1:40:28] and rock your boat with all kinds of
[1:40:30] various
[1:40:31] opinions
[1:40:35] come on now and instead of staying
[1:40:37] straight on the word and saying
[1:40:39] i know he's the same yesterday today or
[1:40:42] forever
[1:40:42] and he can calm this storm he'll get us
[1:40:45] through
[1:40:45] because he's in our ship and there ain't
[1:40:49] enough devils
[1:40:50] in hell can destroy the ship that jesus
[1:40:52] is
[1:40:53] in
[1:40:56] hallelujah the gates of hell shall not
[1:41:00] prevail against her they ain't enough
[1:41:03] demons
[1:41:04] there ain't enough sickness there ain't
[1:41:06] enough trouble
[1:41:07] that can destroy and take down the ship
[1:41:10] that jesus is in and if you've got the
[1:41:13] holy ghost this morning
[1:41:14] there's not enough trouble not enough
[1:41:17] devils not enough sickness
[1:41:19] that can take you down and defeat you
[1:41:23] you're coming through the storm
[1:41:28] hope jesus is in your boat
[1:41:40] let him blow he knows
[1:41:44] he knows we're headed for him
[1:41:47] we're on our way
[1:41:51] we're on our way to find
[1:41:54] a legion a son of god
[1:41:57] a daughter of god who has been bound by
[1:42:00] devils
[1:42:01] and pulled down by hell
[1:42:04] but we're on our way because there's
[1:42:07] deliverance coming for god's children
[1:42:10] and god's people are going to be free
[1:42:17] every devil ever sinned
[1:42:20] every disease ever affliction
[1:42:33] hallelujah
[1:42:36] a prophet saw your coming and he said
[1:42:39] satan be careful there's somebody
[1:42:44] that is headed across the troubled sea
[1:42:47] and they're going to make it through to
[1:42:48] the other side
[1:42:50] because they got jesus in their ship
[1:42:59] and we're going to see delivered for all
[1:43:00] the seven ages
[1:43:02] and the dead and cracks arise and we
[1:43:05] shall be changed
[1:43:06] in a moment and a twinkling of an eye
[1:43:09] it's god's promise and his promise never
[1:43:12] fails
[1:43:13] [Applause]
[1:43:20] she can only catch that vision
[1:43:24] god's still god
[1:43:28] he's not changed a bit he divided
[1:43:31] himself on the day of pentecost
[1:43:33] and part of that division is in me a
[1:43:37] portion of deity
[1:43:38] lays on the inside of me come on
[1:43:40] somebody
[1:43:41] amen the holy ghost with all this fire
[1:43:44] is right on in here and it's omnipotence
[1:43:47] and omnipotence can speak against sin
[1:43:50] against the seed
[1:43:51] against trouble hello hallelujah because
[1:43:54] we're not nebulous speaks
[1:43:56] all things happen because believers
[1:44:00] are believing
[1:44:11] each has a portion i got a portion of
[1:44:14] god you got a portion of god
[1:44:17] but in that portion is omnipotence
[1:44:22] i'm talking to a bunch of devil
[1:44:23] defeaters
[1:44:25] hey man bunch of mountain moosers movers
[1:44:28] satan bruisers amen
[1:44:32] some this morning's gonna rise up and
[1:44:34] crush the head
[1:44:35] of that serpent that's been bothering
[1:44:37] you for way too long
[1:44:41] you'll be able to break those cycles in
[1:44:43] your life
[1:44:44] of up and down and in and out it's
[1:44:48] something like that they need to wake
[1:44:49] jesus
[1:44:51] but sadly there's others that don't have
[1:44:53] jesus to wake
[1:44:58] some churches cannot say it
[1:45:02] some churches i only speak in from 50
[1:45:04] years of experience
[1:45:06] not speaking as a novice here slinging
[1:45:09] out some words everywhere
[1:45:10] i'm just saying some of you don't have
[1:45:12] jesus to wake
[1:45:15] he ain't been in your church in so many
[1:45:17] years you wouldn't even know him if he
[1:45:18] came
[1:45:20] there's not been an amen or a hallelujah
[1:45:22] or glory to god
[1:45:26] come on amen you went off without and
[1:45:29] there's individuals
[1:45:31] that are sitting just as cold in their
[1:45:33] heart because jesus has never been in
[1:45:36] their boat
[1:45:40] oh they heard the word and they went
[1:45:44] off without him they went out on mission
[1:45:47] they went out to do this they went out
[1:45:49] to do great things they went out to
[1:45:50] fulfill a commission
[1:45:51] but they didn't have jesus
[1:45:59] and then the winds begin to blow and
[1:46:02] trouble comes
[1:46:05] and they ain't no jesus in the ship to
[1:46:08] awake
[1:46:11] but all hope isn't lost because he's not
[1:46:14] going to lose
[1:46:14] one of his and in the darkness of the
[1:46:18] night
[1:46:19] in the darkest hour jesus comes along
[1:46:24] walking on the water that's trying to
[1:46:26] destroy you
[1:46:30] because every devil is under his feet
[1:46:34] [Applause]
[1:46:34] [Music]
[1:46:36] hallelujah and you know what that did
[1:46:38] that gave peter faith to say
[1:46:40] if that's you lord you know they began
[1:46:42] to cry that might be a spirit
[1:46:45] oh and they were afraid
[1:46:48] some were afraid of the new birth some
[1:46:50] are afraid of the new movement of the
[1:46:51] spirit
[1:46:52] some are afraid they might be called
[1:46:53] pentecostal to have
[1:46:55] all the word
[1:46:58] hello oh we got the perfect word
[1:47:01] not without the gifts of the spirit you
[1:47:03] don't you just got a portion
[1:47:08] i'm gonna rest a minute
[1:47:12] water and let you think
[1:47:15] gotta water the camel
[1:47:19] now as we think about it
[1:47:22] they don't have jesus he ain't there
[1:47:25] why he never been there and so long
[1:47:29] they can't even remember when
[1:47:32] they got the commission to go and they
[1:47:35] went without him
[1:47:37] they thought they got a commission to go
[1:47:39] they got a great message
[1:47:41] they thought god sent a great message
[1:47:43] and the seal was open here they go
[1:47:45] running here they go sailing away
[1:47:49] we're going to tell everybody
[1:47:53] and jesus is not in your boat
[1:47:57] but he ain't losing one of his
[1:48:00] and he's up watching from a high heel
[1:48:04] and he sees the trouble that you're in
[1:48:07] and he ain't going to leave none of his
[1:48:08] children out
[1:48:10] even though you did a stupid thing to go
[1:48:12] without him
[1:48:14] amen he ain't going to leave you out
[1:48:16] he's coming to you
[1:48:18] hallelujah amen and he's not a spook and
[1:48:22] he's not a
[1:48:23] spirit obie is but not a bad one he's a
[1:48:26] holy spirit
[1:48:28] and if you look if you just cry out to
[1:48:30] him he'll make you walk on your waters
[1:48:35] peter said if that's you didn't become
[1:48:38] well it's me
[1:48:39] come on well he gets out there and he
[1:48:41] walks on the waters
[1:48:44] but jesus still isn't in his boat
[1:48:49] and you might have great faith and be
[1:48:51] able to do great things and
[1:48:52] have great things happen and this and
[1:48:55] that
[1:48:55] but unless jesus gets in your boat
[1:48:58] you're still in trouble
[1:49:01] because any time you get your eyes off
[1:49:03] of him you're going to sink
[1:49:05] but he's the god of second chances he's
[1:49:08] the god of third chances
[1:49:10] he's the god of four chances he's the
[1:49:13] god of many
[1:49:14] chances he's the god that's calling on
[1:49:16] your heart this morning
[1:49:17] because he's a god rich in mercy
[1:49:19] [Applause]
[1:49:22] and all peter had to do is get his eyes
[1:49:24] back on jesus and say
[1:49:26] lord help me i perished
[1:49:29] and he lifted him out and immediately
[1:49:32] they were in the boat
[1:49:37] isn't it wonderful when one finally gets
[1:49:39] jesus
[1:49:40] in their boat you know then their storm
[1:49:43] begins to cease
[1:49:45] they can sail through troubled waters
[1:49:49] i mean drug women popularity money
[1:49:51] whatever it is will never drag you down
[1:49:54] again
[1:49:54] it'll never seek your boat
[1:49:58] because you got jesus in the boat
[1:50:00] [Applause]
[1:50:05] amen you get jesus in the boat you have
[1:50:09] the birth of the word
[1:50:11] you can have a tongue speaking acts 2 38
[1:50:13] blabbering screaming shouting experience
[1:50:16] that will make you walk on the very
[1:50:18] waters that was about to drown you
[1:50:21] and jesus will lift you up and let you
[1:50:23] walk on the waters again
[1:50:26] even after you've fallen isn't he a god
[1:50:28] reaching mercy
[1:50:30] even after you got your eyes off of him
[1:50:32] he'll reach right down there for you
[1:50:33] once again
[1:50:34] and then you'll have jesus in your boat
[1:50:37] because immediately
[1:50:40] he'll come to the boat with you
[1:50:42] [Music]
[1:50:44] and when he gets in the boat the storm
[1:50:50] ceases
[1:50:52] peace a wonder
[1:50:56] for peace oh now coming down
[1:51:01] from the father above don't want to sing
[1:51:06] too much because
[1:51:07] you'll think i'm quitting preaching i
[1:51:08] ain't
[1:51:11] i just now started to fight
[1:51:14] i'm just getting my second win
[1:51:17] [Applause]
[1:51:19] the disciples found himself at the end
[1:51:21] of the road
[1:51:24] you know we're having trouble covert 19.
[1:51:32] so i'm i'm not even going to repeat
[1:51:34] their gossip
[1:51:37] it ain't worthy of talking about they
[1:51:40] can't handle the word they
[1:51:41] i can't rightly divide it so they mess
[1:51:43] it all up
[1:51:44] but let me just say it this way cold at
[1:51:47] 19 don't mean you don't have the token
[1:51:51] that's a lie from the pits of hell and
[1:51:54] you can tell them jesus said it through
[1:51:56] tim pruitt
[1:52:02] we get sick we get cancers we got
[1:52:04] troubles
[1:52:06] yet we're still christians it has
[1:52:09] nothing to do with the soul
[1:52:14] but brother branham talks about it they
[1:52:16] were having a rest between revivals
[1:52:21] and there you know jesus was taking a
[1:52:23] rest
[1:52:24] and they were resting and they were
[1:52:26] testifying oh you remember
[1:52:28] oh my that mighty story about that
[1:52:31] little colored lady down there in
[1:52:33] memphis
[1:52:34] tennessee where she called elijah down
[1:52:37] out of the skies
[1:52:40] to come to her need because god was
[1:52:44] trying to show you you don't have to be
[1:52:46] rich and
[1:52:46] affluent and a big somebody
[1:52:50] you can be the poorest of the poorest
[1:52:52] but your prayer can move
[1:52:53] jesus where elijah will come to your
[1:52:57] door
[1:53:01] or his servant whatever it is
[1:53:06] oh we've testified my overseas you know
[1:53:10] why you know that boy he's dancing on a
[1:53:13] chain and thinking he wants to do tricks
[1:53:15] and he's all crippled up
[1:53:16] and everything else and and in one
[1:53:18] moment's time
[1:53:20] he jumps up and all his bones cracked
[1:53:22] and he's healed and has a right mind
[1:53:26] god can still heal the the
[1:53:31] not popular to use that word why they
[1:53:33] call that
[1:53:34] now handicapped he can god can heal and
[1:53:38] restore it all
[1:53:45] a man takes one moment of believing him
[1:53:48] it can be a newborn christian just lays
[1:53:50] their hands over on their little child
[1:53:51] and here and comes back
[1:53:57] amen it doesn't take the great and the
[1:53:59] mighty just takes one believer they're
[1:54:01] the great and almighty
[1:54:03] because the humblest of god's believers
[1:54:12] so well brother tim i don't know if god
[1:54:15] will even hear
[1:54:16] my prayers i just don't know well
[1:54:19] you know sometimes we get it so we get
[1:54:23] so
[1:54:23] out of touch with how this god responds
[1:54:26] to the need
[1:54:28] of humanity
[1:54:32] if i don't tell this right menthon you
[1:54:34] forgive me but
[1:54:35] i'll just tell it as i've been told we
[1:54:38] got a doctor in town that
[1:54:40] was not well let's just put it this way
[1:54:43] he had a filthy mouth he was uh
[1:54:48] he was a a pain management doctor and
[1:54:50] back surgeon
[1:54:52] and he didn't have good bedside manners
[1:54:54] and was rude
[1:55:00] he got coveted 19 they put him
[1:55:04] down finally in a respirator
[1:55:07] how many days was that 41 days 41 days
[1:55:14] when he finally got come out and got
[1:55:15] loose of it
[1:55:17] he looked over to the attendant
[1:55:18] physician
[1:55:21] he said you know something very strange
[1:55:23] happened
[1:55:24] six times
[1:55:27] i went into a very very dark room
[1:55:31] and he said my father-in-law an old
[1:55:32] doctor he was a heart surgeon there
[1:55:34] noted man in shreveport
[1:55:39] when i did some of the first heart
[1:55:41] surgeries and things i understand
[1:55:43] in our area he's deceased
[1:55:47] and he came to him six times
[1:55:51] and said when you go back
[1:55:55] you get your life right
[1:55:59] six times he went in that dark room six
[1:56:01] times he's told that
[1:56:03] he comes up and he tells us a tendon
[1:56:05] physician
[1:56:06] and the doc says six times your heart
[1:56:10] stopped beating
[1:56:11] and six times i brought you back
[1:56:23] and he turns and he says and while i was
[1:56:26] on the ventilator
[1:56:28] there was a time i could see and i could
[1:56:30] look around and
[1:56:31] i thought it was angels but it was
[1:56:33] people and they were praying
[1:56:36] and that's because there was a prayer
[1:56:37] chain going around
[1:56:39] for this man that would god would heal
[1:56:42] him
[1:56:44] because god hears prayers and today he's
[1:56:47] come out of it
[1:56:49] and some of our church members whose
[1:56:51] visit to office says
[1:56:52] now there's gospel music playing in the
[1:56:54] office
[1:56:57] now he prays with them and says god
[1:56:59] bless you
[1:57:06] and you think that i've got to only do
[1:57:08] something for you
[1:57:09] and me no god's a god who's got a great
[1:57:11] big heart
[1:57:12] who'll reach out to the church to the
[1:57:14] bride to the lust to the dying
[1:57:19] because he's a god-rich and mercy
[1:57:22] you may think the day of grace is over
[1:57:25] that's because you become
[1:57:26] so great and mighty in your own way in
[1:57:28] your own thinking you think you can
[1:57:30] close the door but god says i still got
[1:57:32] it open
[1:57:41] listen i'll take it i don't care what
[1:57:43] denomination he belongs to today i'll
[1:57:46] take it
[1:57:48] there's going to be some of them that
[1:57:49] will be part of the church
[1:57:51] and they're the redeemed they're in the
[1:57:52] book of life
[1:57:55] you know what i mean by redeemed they're
[1:57:57] in the book of redemption
[1:57:59] that's what i mean that's all i mean
[1:58:03] now but he's been taking a rest
[1:58:06] between revivals
[1:58:10] and and there there's another revival
[1:58:14] coming you know again you know and he
[1:58:18] says
[1:58:18] brother branham says that we're resting
[1:58:21] between revivals
[1:58:23] could remind the people around the world
[1:58:26] that's what we've been doing we have
[1:58:30] been
[1:58:30] resting between revivals
[1:58:36] you know brother brandon said we are
[1:58:38] looking for another stir where there's
[1:58:40] got to be something happen that
[1:58:42] calls the church that will gather the
[1:58:44] church together
[1:58:46] he he says there's there's another
[1:58:50] surge that is coming and of course we
[1:58:52] can look back at the revival past
[1:58:55] oh there was miracles and other and let
[1:58:57] me just remind you
[1:58:58] there's not going to be another
[1:58:59] worldwide sweeping revival like that
[1:59:03] it's over
[1:59:07] this next revival this revival that
[1:59:10] we're in is taking the bride home to
[1:59:12] glory
[1:59:15] that's why brother adam would say i am
[1:59:17] looking for another surge of the spirit
[1:59:19] the coming of the lord
[1:59:21] he said again in the token he said i'm
[1:59:23] looking for a break forth
[1:59:25] time of break forth there's the spirit
[1:59:26] of god in these last days that we're
[1:59:28] living in
[1:59:29] for another surge of the holy spirit
[1:59:31] into the church for rapture and faith
[1:59:33] just before it comes and everything is
[1:59:36] sitting straight in order
[1:59:37] and i believe we're at the time now that
[1:59:39] the word should have preeminence
[1:59:43] and we've had 50 plus years
[1:59:47] and of course there's been a lot of
[1:59:48] storming hours
[1:59:50] but i want to remind you he says again
[1:59:52] there will be an outboard this is after
[1:59:55] 63.
[1:59:55] there will be a big outpouring of the
[1:59:57] spirit yes to grab that church
[2:00:00] and take her in the skies exactly see
[2:00:02] because the church the word the bride in
[2:00:04] christ's ministry is
[2:00:06] is it is in his bride which is his body
[2:00:09] and let me just paraphrase it this way
[2:00:11] the supernatural body the spiritual body
[2:00:13] abuse here on the earth
[2:00:15] his spirit is in there living his life
[2:00:18] right out until
[2:00:19] him and the church becomes one for the
[2:00:21] wedding
[2:00:24] that's what he says and what shall i do
[2:00:26] with jesus called christ
[2:00:28] god's little flock that believes the
[2:00:30] word is mechanics is ready too it's
[2:00:32] ready for the dynamics to set it
[2:00:34] forth with the holy spirit
[2:00:38] so i'm looking for another shaking
[2:00:41] god's gonna send another shaken this
[2:00:44] chapter 63
[2:00:46] in jeffersonville for those of you that
[2:00:49] like it to be there
[2:00:52] by the way he said go compel him to come
[2:00:54] in
[2:00:56] there's still room
[2:01:00] they may be in the highways and the
[2:01:02] byways
[2:01:04] but there's still room at the table
[2:01:08] you say brother to him as why is a
[2:01:10] rapture waiting so long hey i wanted it
[2:01:13] when i was a 15 year old boy preacher
[2:01:16] 50 years ago but god has made it wait
[2:01:19] for you and you and you
[2:01:22] and you and you and you because he's not
[2:01:26] going to leave a hook
[2:01:27] behind
[2:01:29] [Applause]
[2:01:32] there's still room
[2:01:35] and i believe maybe in the next few
[2:01:37] months or something a year or whatever
[2:01:39] it is
[2:01:40] god is going to send another shaking
[2:01:42] across the country
[2:01:43] for there's still somebody out there
[2:01:45] somewhere that's a predestinated seed
[2:01:48] that the light has to fall on somewhere
[2:01:51] in the world
[2:01:55] it might be someone like philip who
[2:01:57] tried and tried and tried to do this on
[2:01:59] his own
[2:02:00] but one day the light struck the seed
[2:02:04] come on somebody and my one day you know
[2:02:07] a child of god can go a long time the
[2:02:10] prophet of god said
[2:02:11] before that seed germinates but god's
[2:02:14] got an
[2:02:15] hour god's got a time god
[2:02:18] does these things to give a hope for
[2:02:20] somebody else
[2:02:22] hey man he'll listen he'll let my wife
[2:02:25] have a brain bleed
[2:02:26] to give hope for somebody else that god
[2:02:28] can still heal brain bleed
[2:02:30] he'll let another have cancer and heal
[2:02:32] to sow and give hope to somebody else
[2:02:35] that they're still a god of miracles
[2:02:40] and god will god will let one come in
[2:02:44] and there to come this way in that way
[2:02:48] and just make partial steps
[2:02:49] and make a big mess out of everything
[2:02:52] and then turn around and make
[2:02:54] be god rich in mercy and take a guy like
[2:02:58] philip
[2:02:58] who had time after time and youth camp
[2:03:01] after youth camp
[2:03:02] and altar called after alzheim but one
[2:03:04] day in the presence of god
[2:03:06] a she germinated something he always
[2:03:09] wanted in his heart
[2:03:10] and it's never been the same
[2:03:20] yeah the same with you sherman
[2:03:24] gave you another chance vicki because
[2:03:26] he's of god reaching
[2:03:28] mercy
[2:03:31] i could have him pop up all over this
[2:03:32] building
[2:03:34] a god who cares
[2:03:38] he'll get you some way come on amen you
[2:03:41] say oh brother tim i'd like to have that
[2:03:43] i'd like to have that experience like
[2:03:44] that doctor did
[2:03:46] you don't have to have that experience
[2:03:48] you got a preacher to preach to you
[2:03:51] you got an angel in the pulpit to bring
[2:03:53] you a message
[2:03:54] to tell you today is the day of
[2:03:56] salvation
[2:03:57] and you can turn from darkness to life
[2:04:04] and brother branham said god is going to
[2:04:06] send another satan
[2:04:08] across the country where there's
[2:04:10] somebody still out there
[2:04:12] somewhere that's a predestinated seed

[2:04:19] and say you know i've been and i went
[2:04:21] off without jesus

[2:05:18] that's going to come back and say my
[2:05:21] hair's growing out
[2:05:24] everything the devil robbed from me the
[2:05:27] power is coming back
[2:05:29] i'm making seven locks out of it now for

[2:05:34] and i'm clothed with a nazarite vow
[2:05:37] oh just once more lord
[2:05:42] just once more send your power
[2:05:52] brother branham said we find in every
[2:05:54] walk of life
[2:05:56] salesmen that claim to be salesmen
[2:05:57] they're not electricians
[2:05:59] claim to be electricians they're not
[2:06:02] mechanics who claim to mechanics and not
[2:06:05] we find men who claim to be christians
[2:06:08] and are not
[2:06:10] jesus plainly stated what a christian
[2:06:12] was
[2:06:13] these signs have followed them that
[2:06:14] believe what they would do what the
[2:06:17] believing church
[2:06:18] would do we can claim we're bride
[2:06:21] and not be it because if the signs don't
[2:06:24] follow it
[2:06:25] we're just making an empty statement and
[2:06:28] an empty claim
[2:06:30] but the signs must follow them that
[2:06:32] believe
[2:06:33] the signs of a believing church there
[2:06:35] will be miracles
[2:06:38] there will be healing there will be a
[2:06:40] genuine
[2:06:41] atmosphere of the holy ghost there will
[2:06:44] be gifts of the spirit
[2:06:46] there will be genuine christians living
[2:06:48] and overcoming life
[2:06:50] [Applause]
[2:06:54] that's what will be in a believing
[2:06:56] church
[2:06:58] these disciples they've been bragging
[2:07:02] some are bragging on this theology wow
[2:07:05] man when he poked us
[2:07:06] broke the seals and man that seventh
[2:07:09] seal
[2:07:10] man i've got part one and part two and
[2:07:12] part 10 and part 27
[2:07:14] seal a seven seal is seventh seal this
[2:07:16] and seven seal this
[2:07:18] and you can see their titles seven seals
[2:07:20] and they're trying to convince you they
[2:07:21] really believe in the seventh seal
[2:07:24] but they never had the coming
[2:07:28] they're preaching about the coming but
[2:07:30] never had the coming
[2:07:38] they're over here in the ship
[2:07:41] they're talking about all of these other
[2:07:44] things they know there was a revival
[2:07:47] we have the seals the thunders we
[2:07:49] understand predestination
[2:07:51] the difference between that and free
[2:07:54] moral agency and we've been back and
[2:07:56] we've talked about it and you know like
[2:07:59] i said the big one the seventh seal
[2:08:01] we're we're not we're not first and
[2:08:04] second paul believers
[2:08:05] we got the word so we're third paul
[2:08:08] believers
[2:08:10] oh well where's the signs of that
[2:08:16] where is the power of salvation that
[2:08:18] brings conviction
[2:08:19] to young center boys and girls and they
[2:08:22] fall on their knees
[2:08:23] to repent and give and then live an
[2:08:26] overcoming life
[2:08:28] why is porn still a problem with them
[2:08:32] why are they so caught up in video games
[2:08:35] they have no appetite for the word and
[2:08:37] they're born again
[2:08:39] where's the power to change atmospheres
[2:08:43] to speak to the storms
[2:08:46] so divorces aren't happening in our
[2:08:48] churches
[2:08:50] amen where where's the power of healing
[2:08:54] where the word goes forth and remove
[2:08:56] tumors before the doctor's hands
[2:08:58] touch them if you're not the third pull
[2:09:00] word then let's see it manifest
[2:09:06] oh we've had a great revival and then
[2:09:10] a great cooling off
[2:09:14] oh yeah resting between revivals
[2:09:18] we can remember some remembers the
[2:09:20] miracles
[2:09:21] the dead baby that was raised down in
[2:09:23] mexico and
[2:09:24] man man what a prophet
[2:09:28] what a miracle what a what what a mighty
[2:09:30] god worked through that man
[2:09:33] oh my those days those days what a what
[2:09:37] am
[2:09:38] what a man other over here what a great
[2:09:41] doctrine
[2:09:43] what a great truth we got today and oh
[2:09:46] my
[2:09:46] we dissect it and trisect it and
[2:09:49] we splice it up and jam this quote with
[2:09:52] that one and jam that one until we got
[2:09:54] something that the brother branham
[2:09:56] didn't even say and
[2:09:57] we become so great we can interpret now
[2:10:01] what's between the line that we can got
[2:10:04] something new
[2:10:05] and say things that ain't even on the
[2:10:07] line
[2:10:10] are you with me amen amen
[2:10:14] but that's when trouble starts when the
[2:10:17] church
[2:10:18] forgets about the presence of jesus
[2:10:21] christ
[2:10:22] when we forget and begin to stew and
[2:10:25] fast
[2:10:26] and make little denominations that are
[2:10:28] tighter
[2:10:29] than uh than even the denominations out
[2:10:33] there
[2:10:34] till it becomes us four and no more
[2:10:37] that's where the trouble starts
[2:10:40] but as long as christ is there and the
[2:10:42] holy spirit is blessing the people
[2:10:44] you know we don't care what color or
[2:10:46] creed that it is you know we're all one
[2:10:48] great
[2:10:48] pool of god's blessing we're just
[2:10:50] fellowshipping on the blood
[2:10:52] but when we begin to think we're the
[2:10:54] biggest church
[2:10:55] my ministry's got more views than yours
[2:11:00] well i've had more hits on facebook than
[2:11:03] you have
[2:11:05] all the other things you know we got
[2:11:08] intellectual trained men
[2:11:10] that can bring a script bring out a
[2:11:12] message you can hardly lay a finger on
[2:11:14] it
[2:11:16] but brother brandon said what i want to
[2:11:18] know is where is that manifestation
[2:11:21] see intellectual sermons and we're tired
[2:11:25] of intellectual sermons
[2:11:27] [Music]
[2:11:28] we're tired of preacherettes with
[2:11:31] sermonettes
[2:11:33] that produces christianettes
[2:11:36] we want real things not the intellectual
[2:11:40] giants
[2:11:40] who know the greek and put it together
[2:11:42] intellectually and yet
[2:11:44] their heart has never really been
[2:11:46] changed
[2:11:49] but jesus said lo i'm with you always
[2:11:54] let's talk about that for a moment
[2:11:56] there's so many things
[2:11:59] that we can speak about just for a
[2:12:01] moment
[2:12:02] but what did he say
[2:12:06] what did he say why don't we try
[2:12:09] hebrews 13 5. let's just look at that
[2:12:13] for a moment
[2:12:15] let me just bring this up
[2:12:18] let me just try this for a minute
[2:12:22] let your the way you live
[2:12:26] be without covetousness be content with
[2:12:30] such things as you have
[2:12:33] for he has said
[2:12:36] i will never leave thee not for safety
[2:12:42] does he keep his promise is he true to
[2:12:45] his word is somebody with me yet
[2:12:48] amen what does he say in matthew let's
[2:12:51] try to say
[2:12:52] matthew is it 2820
[2:12:56] right there where where he says
[2:12:59] or yes that's good he says lo
[2:13:03] i am with you always
[2:13:06] even to the end of the world
[2:13:09] right down here to the end of the end of
[2:13:11] the end to the end of the end
[2:13:14] i'm with you always
[2:13:17] amen jesus is in the ship
[2:13:21] even unlike tabernacle i want you to
[2:13:24] know jesus
[2:13:25] is in the ship we can talk about things
[2:13:28] oh yes
[2:13:29] oh my that day atlanta run around the
[2:13:32] church that day
[2:13:33] this happened that day when the holy
[2:13:35] spirit swept
[2:13:36] through my room and my wife's blindness
[2:13:38] went away
[2:13:39] and little drew got up out of the floor
[2:13:41] and never walked at 18 months old and
[2:13:43] ran around the house
[2:13:48] when trouble comes to your house
[2:13:51] when the doctor says your daughter's got
[2:13:53] cancer
[2:13:54] your wife your child you you've got
[2:14:05] then you get fearful and afraid

[2:14:15] happening in the dexter's house and
[2:14:17] happened over here and there
[2:14:20] when it happened over in the oglesby's
[2:14:22] house and kidneys were restored and
[2:14:24] i believe that i i knew it can happen
[2:14:27] for you god bless you brother but when
[2:14:29] he comes to your house
[2:14:35] that's when you're going to want to wake
[2:14:36] jesus
[2:14:38] that's when you're going to have to
[2:14:39] reach over there and say
[2:14:43] i don't need a rest anymore i need a
[2:14:45] revival
[2:14:47] that's when you need another shaking and
[2:14:49] say shake me lord
[2:14:51] amen and where your faith begins to rise
[2:14:54] up come on
[2:14:56] are you with me church amen will you

[2:15:27] to jesus in your life to cognates and
[2:15:31] recognition
[2:15:32] and back to the forefront again and
[2:15:34] that's your faith

[2:17:56] there's storms on every side
[2:17:59] kobet is raging through the country
[2:18:04] it's only the first precursor
[2:18:07] of plagues that are coming they're only
[2:18:10] going to get worse
[2:18:12] financial crisis on the horizon there's
[2:18:16] nothing sure
[2:18:18] there's storms everywhere and your
[2:18:22] marriage ain't going to hold together
[2:18:23] without
[2:18:24] god don't matter who you are
[2:18:29] you gotta have jesus
[2:18:32] and your children gonna stray unless you
[2:18:35] get an old-fashioned altar back in your
[2:18:36] home
[2:18:39] and make it the very goal of your life
[2:18:41] to raise children for god
[2:18:43] instead of your stupid career but one
[2:18:46] day you're going to look and say how
[2:18:47] stupid was i
[2:19:00] you cannot remain
[2:19:04] where you're at we're in a time
[2:19:07] where he's sending another shaking
[2:19:11] everything that can be shaken will be
[2:19:12] shaken
[2:19:14] the only thing that's built on the word
[2:19:16] of god is what's going to
[2:19:17] survive it
[2:19:22] oh yeah we got trouble satan
[2:19:25] blows his poisonous breath
[2:19:31] until days and miracles are passed
[2:19:34] and ain't no such thing as divine
[2:19:36] healing
[2:19:40] and the church by and large sits in a
[2:19:41] backslidden condition
[2:19:45] and maybe that's where you're at this
[2:19:47] morning
[2:19:51] why does god let these things happen
[2:19:54] why does it happen like that why does he
[2:19:56] let
[2:19:57] trouble come to your door and it will
[2:20:00] you can sit back and smuggle
[2:20:02] oh hallelujah i got the token and ain't
[2:20:04] nothing coming oh yeah it will
[2:20:07] because you're human that's why it comes
[2:20:10] not because you're a christian that
[2:20:11] ain't why it comes it comes because
[2:20:12] you're human and all humans get it
[2:20:15] you're corporal
[2:20:17] and your body and is immune to
[2:20:19] everything but did you know
[2:20:21] that just as your as the winds and waves
[2:20:25] had to obey
[2:20:26] his will your body has to obey his will
[2:20:31] hallelujah that when his word speaks to
[2:20:33] your storm in your life come on
[2:20:35] your body will obey cancers will leave
[2:20:38] you you know why
[2:20:39] because greater is he that is in you
[2:20:42] that he that's in the world and there is
[2:20:45] in your life
[2:20:46] and he's there to rise up but your faith
[2:20:49] has to call him back to the forefront
[2:20:58] you may be sitting here with heart
[2:20:59] trouble
[2:21:01] god don't heal you might be dead before
[2:21:03] the morning
[2:21:08] why we let the sick lay when we were
[2:21:11] told to cast out devils
[2:21:15] how come youth camp we cast out ten
[2:21:17] demonic manifestations
[2:21:19] why is it that our youth aren't getting
[2:21:20] the holy ghost instead they're getting
[2:21:22] full of
[2:21:23] devils that we're dealing with in prayer
[2:21:27] lines
[2:21:32] why is it he's proved over and over
[2:21:36] again
[2:21:36] that he really gives the baptism of the
[2:21:38] holy ghost
[2:21:40] he proves again and again he cast out
[2:21:42] devils he
[2:21:43] he told us you know our official
[2:21:45] commission
[2:21:46] is to cast satan out and a church
[2:21:49] that is not casting satan out is not of
[2:21:52] god
[2:21:57] because how satan sinners are saved you
[2:21:59] cast out satan
[2:22:01] people are healed
[2:22:04] it's all casting out the devil
[2:22:08] it must have dawned on some of them that
[2:22:10] the creator
[2:22:11] was still with them i hope they're
[2:22:14] coming dawning to you this morning
[2:22:17] that the creator is still with us
[2:22:20] because he said i'll never leave you or
[2:22:22] forsake you
[2:22:24] amen they awakened jesus they called him
[2:22:26] on the scene they'd seen many things
[2:22:28] done
[2:22:28] and the words words vindicate him and so
[2:22:31] we
[2:22:32] and he was not hard to call
[2:22:35] into action you know why because our
[2:22:38] faith brings christ into our presence
[2:22:43] what a promise that is amen when your
[2:22:47] lips begin to move
[2:22:48] and you begin to call on god
[2:22:52] when you begin to knock when you begin
[2:22:55] to seek
[2:22:56] when you begin to ask and when the
[2:22:58] church begins to call and seek and ask
[2:23:02] it awake the jesus that's in the midst
[2:23:06] amen and he'll cause you a man to walk
[2:23:08] on your waters
[2:23:10] he'll cause the seeds that were
[2:23:12] boisterous and the winds that were
[2:23:13] blowing to become steel
[2:23:15] and sickness will begin to leave and
[2:23:17] diseases will leave your body
[2:23:19] and while the word is preached hands
[2:23:22] won't even have to be
[2:23:23] laid on you but you can be healed or
[2:23:25] saved or delivered
[2:23:28] or you can find a place at an altar
[2:23:30] where it can happen but it's going to
[2:23:31] happen
[2:23:36] the revival the rest i want to say this
[2:23:39] the rest is about over
[2:23:44] it's time to wake him he's rested long
[2:23:47] enough
[2:23:49] between the revivals we're about to have
[2:23:52] another revival don't you miss it
[2:23:54] it'll be the last revival it will not be
[2:23:57] a worldwide sweeping known revival
[2:23:59] it'll be a revival where the holy spirit
[2:24:02] surges through the church
[2:24:03] and we're changed in a moment and a
[2:24:06] twinkling of an eye
[2:24:10] and we caught up to meet the lord in the
[2:24:12] air why don't we bow our heads together
[2:24:17] his ministry has never ceased
[2:24:21] brother branham was asked the question
[2:24:22] how do you wake christ
[2:24:24] by believing his word faith brings him
[2:24:26] on the scene
[2:24:28] that's what brings him on the scene
[2:24:29] faith then call on him to confirm his
[2:24:31] word
[2:24:32] and don't doubt and fear don't do it
[2:24:34] don't do that
[2:24:35] just believe him as it's written and let
[2:24:37] it be done
[2:24:38] and god will prove to you that jesus
[2:24:40] christ
[2:24:42] he is the same yesterday today and
[2:24:43] forever
[2:24:45] i wonder while our heads are bowed and
[2:24:47] our eyes are closed and we're thinking
[2:24:49] about it
