Lord is a beautiful atmosphere to step into knowing Lord that this is only a foretaste of Lord that City to come and that world to come that perfect place that is calling us I pray Lord Jesus as we're

Hearts we love you from the bottom of our hearts and we just ask Lord that you'll bless us now in thine divine presence in Jesus Christ's name amen amen thank you very much let's turn in our Bibles this evening we appreciate it you all let's turn to Zachariah chapter 4 and we'll start with verse 1. Zechariah chapter 4. appreciate the worship tonight everybody there and the angel that talked with me came again and wake to me is a man that has awakened out of his sleep and he said unto me what seeth thou. a and I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick all of gold and with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof and I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my Lord and the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be I said no my Lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord undeserubbable saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts who art thou o great Mountain before zerubbabel thou shall become a plane and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house and his hand shall also finish it and that and thou shall know that the Lord of hosts has sent me unto you for who if despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubbabel with those seven and they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole Earth praise the Lord I want to preach this evening on the day of small things God bless you may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his word Matthew chapter 11 verse 25 could you pull that up on the screen are you able to thank you brother are we able to pull that up Matthew 11 25 Jesus said at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father so it seemed good in thy sight it was this scripture that brother Branham uses to open God revealed in Simplicity which opened the series of the Seven Seals and brother Branham built the entire seers uh the seal series upon God hiding himself in Simplicity and revealing himself in the same way and he used this scripture that he said it would be strange that the Lord would hide himself from one group and reveal himself to another he said and the wise miss it by a million miles praise the Lord you won't hurt me at all if you just say praise the Lord amen let's enter in if you can help me tonight and he and he and he said this he said I thought that we might study this before the great teaching of the Seven Seals he said now many miss him by the way that he reveals himself we know that that the church is built upon Revelation he said but the people miss him by the way that he reveals himself he said because men have their own ideas what God ought to do and how he ought to do it and he said and because they have maybe a preconceived idea in their mind or or unscriptural expectations that when he comes and reveals himself in a simple way or in a different way or in an unusual way it goes right over their head and he said notice it is it's the way it's always been been looking for what God will do and what he did but missing what he's doing he said the reason that they're missing what he's doing is because he is so simple in the present tense praise the Lord and then he told about the the the Infidel that that was up in the uh Utica area that saw the little girl going from Sunday school and he said where are you going she said I'm I'm I believe I'm going home from Sunday school and he said you said honey you're so wrong to believe that there was a god like that and the girl under the inspiration of the Lord picked a flower and said Mr Dorsey how did this get here what makes this live and it was there the Holy Spirit came upon Mr Dorsey and and brother Branham said at 86 years old he was gloriously converted he said because man can go to the moon but he does not understand how God can make a blade of grass Hallelujah and he said it pleases God to hide his power and His glory in simple things Hallelujah he said God is so great but he makes himself so simple that we stumble over Simplicity Jesus was The Stumbling Stone and they stumbled over the Simplicity of the Messiah can you say Amen now this is where I'm taking us this to get us a platform he says here in God hiding himself in Simplicity he said now you study it remember he's going into the seals he said you study it when you go to your motel rooms and those things you ponder over we don't have time to break it down like it should be broke down he said but I want you to do it get to your hotel wherever you're staring gather together and study this he said we miss him by the way that he reveals himself and how he reveals himself to the least he said we can expect the unusual when we're dealing with God if you know God you know God works in mysterious ways and if you're dealing with God you know if God is going to do something it will be unusual because God works in the unusual Hallelujah and this will always be God's principle theme because he said I am the Lord thy God I change not what he was he is and always will be and God will reveal himself to the simple in an unusual way in a mysterious way but a glorious way hallelujah hallelujah just like brother Tim was preaching on Abraham and Sarah and he's typing it with the church and how Sarah just did not have strength to conceive seed God comes to Abraham in a sovereign way in a glorious way because Abraham did not deserve it and he said I am going to make something great out of you I'm going to make you a father of Nations I'm going to make you I'm going to make you like a like a Son of God exalted in the Earth you would have thought if God was going to make a holy nation that he would have chose at least a young man or a young woman you would have thought that he would have chose someone fertile but God's choice was unusual it was mysterious because he chose an old man and an old woman and one that was Barren at that because God works in mysterious ways but see this is what makes God this is what displays his grace and His glory when he takes someone that can't and he does something with them Hallelujah see Abraham and Sarah were married and infertile but God said now I am making you a father of Nations not to make you something but to make me something it's not Abraham it's God who made Abraham the father of many nations and he said I'm gonna name you Abraham I'm gonna put my own name in your name and then he walked around just as Barren as ever I'm a father of Nations doesn't God move in mysterious ways every day it gets darker and more impossible and more impossible but something on the inside of Abraham is growing more faith and higher faith and because it wasn't Abraham looking to his own ability he was looking to the ability of almighty God it is a greater America it is a greater miracle Hallelujah God's working something out of the life of the Father Abraham and Abraham was a man of mistakes he wasn't a perfect man God put that in the Bible to let you know his children make mistakes but God's grace is greater because it's what God is doing in your life that is great and so Abraham makes a blunder it gets messed up with amblic hamblick says oh that's a beautiful woman he said you tell me you tell him you're you're my sister she said I'm gonna kill you when we get home he said just do what I say you're gonna get me killed that man said I have been looking all these years for in all my kingdom there ain't a woman as pretty as that girl man you got a pretty sister and we're going to be brother-in-laws that night he washed his brother Brandon said he put on his sleeping cap and stuck his big feet up at the end of the bed wiggling his toes think of it tomorrow that that man's sister is going to be my wife the spirit of the Lord came to him in a dream and said you are as good as a dead man he knew the Lord was angry in the dream he said Lord that man told him that he was his sister he said he said I wouldn't have sinned against you I'm a I'm a man of integrity God said that's why I haven't destroyed you but the Bible says he said if you do not give that man back his wife and have him pray for your sinful Soul I'll wipe out your whole nation you know what God was doing there was a word that placed upon the life of Abraham and that word had to be fulfilled and nothing would block that Sarah must bring forth Isaac in order to bring forth the genealogy of Christ it was God defending his own words [Applause] Hallelujah God closed up all the wombs that's why brother Branham said oh The Sovereign Grace of God it wasn't Abraham it was God's word he was defending and he bound himself into Abraham I think you'll be seeing something soon Hallelujah Isaac is born and God placed a word over Isaac's life now I'm talking about God is unusual and and he's I mean this is as brother Tim was saying on Sunday this is the apple of his eye I mean he and Sarah watching this 12 year old boy look at him look at look at that boy he he excels better than anybody you know how daddy does and the spirit of the Lord came to Abraham said now take him up to Mariah and sacrifice that boy what a challenge no he does not give him any answer Lord no no what will Sarah will kill me wow Lord but he had learned the trust The Voice I want you to think about how much do why would God do it and so he goes three days journey and he tells the servants he said stay here while me and the boy go worship and the Holy Spirit brother said the grace of God it speaks out of Abraham and I and my son will come back why because they knew God placed the word upon Isaac and not even if he did die God would raise him up again because God had put a word upon the life of Isaac Hallelujah Hallelujah God's ways are mysterious now we can see in Clarity what God was doing looking back at it it was a perfect type of Jesus Christ but at the time you don't know what is happening but it's perfectly orchestrated God is in every detail God is in every detail of your life he absolutely is don't you think anything is an accident it is when God becomes too common is when we lose our faith is when we go off the road is when the things of God become common become a trend Hallelujah brother random said God is in the unusual he appears at unusual times he said but when we get into a trend then we miss God Hallelujah so in order to serve God we must serve him by faith and brother Branham describe Faith like swimming if I went into the water and if my feet can touch then I'd say look at me I'm swimming no you're not you're still EarthBound but if you can plunge out into the deep and you can't touch bottom then you are swimming and as long as you can see taste feel smelling here and you rest your experience upon an Earthly thing then your feet are still on the ground but when you can Plunge in by faith and begin to live by faith then God has you swimming Hallelujah Hallelujah that's what he said in Ezekiel water to the ankles water to the D water and then Plunge in waters to swim in that's the age we live in is that age of Faith where we are swimming in the glory of God [Applause] by faith the Bible said by faith Moses when he was born they hit him for three months Hallelujah his parents they knew he was a proper child brother Branham said he was when he was born the parents knew divinely that he was an instrument of God now this is amazing once again God is moving in simplicity so he is the son of Levi amram and Djokovic a son and a daughter of Levi they are slaves and God is going to pick the slave out of the mud pit and out of him is going to come forth a deliverer and a perfect type of Jesus Christ Hallelujah so the boy is born and they know he is the one in other words God has tied his Word of Promise into Moses and the Holy Spirit reveals to jacobit this is the man now they don't know anything and the Bible said that because she believed in faith they were not afraid of the king's commandment and when you believe you are not afraid your fear will fall away you know God will take care of his word She's Not Afraid Of The King's commandment she is not intimidated by the witches that are looking to kill her baby she's not intimidated by none of that God will keep his word God placed his word over him they hit him for three months the Bible said they could hear hide him no further and brother Branham dramatizes in an incredible way he said that that uh uh his daddy was praying away wakes up at three in the morning tells jokobed he said let's get down to the river and he said that that God had given amram the Divine instructions of the Ark and she built the ark accordingly and at night at three in the morning and he says this he gathered Aaron and marry him and they all secretly go down to the river and he describes how Miriam is like Daddy you're not going to get rid of her baby brother Daddy he said now you've got to be soldiers now and he tells he said nurse the baby she nurses the baby and then he said now put him in the ark and it looks like a little coffin and chocolate is weeping the children are crying and it's ripping her heart out they don't understand this God moves in mysterious ways but they trust that God's word is in this child Aaron and Miriam they kiss him and amram tells them to be of Courage this is so unusual now something amazing takes place all of a sudden God anoints jock a bed with faith is she hot she puts that baby her little baby her prince into that little coffin the Bible said that she took that and she put that that Ark into the river and by faith she pushes this little Ark and everything that's within it she pushes it out into a to a crocodile infested waters the place is swarming and Tails are flapping babies have been eating in here and brother Brandon said this is a type of jocka bed putting her baby by faith into death into the Waters of death but now faith has taken over how can a mother against her own nature send her child on a death trip but it isn't that she sees gloomy clouds but she knows that the sun is still Shining even in your trials even in your hard times the sun is still shining and it wasn't a woman doing this it was eyes of faith that was looking to The God Who made a promise I will deliver my people [Applause] Hallelujah Sun's always Shining John saw him in the church ages he shine like the sun shining in its strength but even when the clouds cover it he's still shining tonight if you're sick he's still shining tonight Hallelujah behind those gloomy clouds was a living God she pushed it out by faith out into the water and when she left when it left her hands it went into the hands of God and as it went out into the waters every Angel is watching over this little Ark it's under the protection of the word of God do you love the Lord jacobit is moving by revelation now brother Branham said because jochebed put this baby in the Water by faith it proved the power of faith is greater than death because the waters were death and by faith she placed her baby there and God gave that baby back he said furthermore she nursed that baby furthermore he said he made the devil pay for his education made the devil feed him and make the devil clothe him he was making the devil raise his own deliverer if you will trust God God will hang the devil on his own Gallows but you've got to have faith you've got to get your feet off the ground and get it into faith in the Living God Hallelujah God put a a word over that child brother Benham said God knows how to do things God knows how to Humble you he sometimes does things in different ways he knows how to take the starch out of you he knows how to make you the man you ought to be he knows what's inside you God does things in great ways God does things in different ways and we know the story Moses was a man of problems and issues and he makes an attempt he falls on his face it don't look right backslides for 40 years and then think about it God decided to use him as an old man you would think that God would use a young man but God uses an old man sometimes God uses young fellas sometimes he uses old people I know the world forgets about you but God doesn't and so God meets him in a burning bush and this is so unusual God never did it before God never met Abraham in a burning bush this was Abraham this is Moses day and he said I'm sending you down now against every Chariot against all the spears of Egypt against the armies a one-man invasion I am sending you down as an old man to deliver my people Hallelujah and he did it God moves in mysterious ways the Bible said my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways and as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts higher than your thoughts we many times we fall into a pit by reasoning you can't reason God you've got to believe God it is a beautiful Faith walk and every individual needs his own faith brother random told a story about his mother-in-law her clock had quit working and she was a poor woman and she said Lord I need this clock to work with you fix it and it started working fine does God does God is he a clock Master is he does he fix clocks he did that one you know why because she was simple enough to believe it wasn't complicated she was simple enough to know if God can move a red sea or Raise A Man from the dead then he can fix my clock I imagine and brother Branham said a few days later her refrigerator went out and she said I can't afford another refrigerator Lord you fix my clock how do you do refrigerators and brother random said it started running again how many sisters believe in that I believe with all my heart that we could have faith like that brother Branham said believe him believe him for a husband believe him for a wife believe him for a job believe him for everything [Applause] I think that's the kind of Faith we're supposed to have in the kitchen young people brother men have said pray over your tests you're supposed to pray God I want a good grade healthy Lord and no matter who you are brother Benham said God is interested in you he's interested in everything our churches no matter how little or how large every lay member if you're a housewife God is interested in you Hallelujah you believe that God is so strange that we talk about Israel how they murmured and they died and they wandered in the wilderness for 40 years and you think my goodness what what Joshua had to go through but then as soon as they get into the land Rahab is there and Rahab is a predestinated seed she comes into the family of Israel and out of all the women God puts her as a mother in the genealogies of Christ this is so strange and we could just go on and on that the nation of Israel was made of barren women God is showing I have done this I wouldn't have put Bathsheba in there I mean how did Bathsheba get in there that blow it's beyond what I can grasp I have no answer and then when God calls Mary to bring forth the Redeemer God comes out of a controversial name who is going to believe this she's got to Bear the reproach of her revelation and she's walking around with a and and she testifies I am innocent and nobody is going to believe her and not even Joseph would have believed her he wanted to I can imagine after six months at Elizabeth's house and he sees her and he says no Joseph Joseph leave me alone thank you God no no she says Joseph I'm innocent I'm innocent and look God moves in mysterious unusual wait and Joseph's like Mary hit you and he goes home God I don't know what to do I don't want to see her stoned I I don't have that in me no doubt he falls asleep stressed and an angel comes that says fear not Joseph for that which is in hers born of the Holy Ghost I am all over this Joseph stay strong he comes out of it and instead of putting her away he becomes her Shield he becomes her protector because God put a word on the inside of that girl and God raised him up to protect that word Hallelujah unusual yes God works in mysterious ways his wonders to perform his footsteps are in the sea and he rides upon the storm deep in unfathomable binds of never-ending skill he works out his treasures and works his Sovereign will Hallelujah Hallelujah God invested something into her God's now he don't care about her reputation he cares about his reputation Hallelujah but now she has a revelation and she can stand there in the face of scoffers she can stand there in the face of it and say I knew whom I believed because she's walking by faith I met an angel and if I've got a standalone I'll Stand amen this Revelation this message ought to be a revelation from heaven that even if you stand alone you'll stand for God because it come from heaven hallowed [Applause] God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound those things that are mighty the base things of the world the things that are despised hath God choose yeah the things which are not to bring to not the things that are that no flesh will glory in his presence God always takes nothing and makes something out of it Hallelujah so it's not man's working it's God's working everybody see that it's God's nature to do it God takes stinky fishermen that's my bride tax collectors oh yeah pluck some from Ohio pluck some from Louisiana we're all in the same pot brother Joe you know why so he can show his glory amen you know 1946 brother Branham launches a healing campaign that the world has never seen the world has never seen what we have witnessed in this day how many believe that and brother Branham said when the angel told him you will pray for kings and monarchs and so forth and the angel tells him and he said I will be with you he said I'll go the angel vanishes and he does not tell brother Branham how he's going to do it he just said you're going to do it brother Brandon said I believe it and he did not tell him how and so we know that it was launched from the supernatural Billy Graham was launched from a public publicity but brother branham's was launched by Supernatural can you say Amen and so brother Benham tells the story he said when I launched the healing campaign he said I did not even have my own suit and he said my brother had gotten in a wreck and tore the suit up and he said so I brought it to meet up media went down to a 10 cent store and ironed iron uh the iron patches on the suit and he said it looked okay he said but then the pocket was torn it might have been here and he said I tried to sew it up and he said I'm not very good and he said so it looks so bad and this is his direct words he said I was pretty well ashamed of it he said so when he went out in the public he would keep it covered with his hand and he would shake with his left hand he said because I was ashamed of that coat he said but when that blind girl from Memphis her eyes came open and the men began to charge him and a man said I know you you're William Branham he said ask God to heal me he said Do you believe it he said I do he said give me your stick he said before my eyes that crippled leg came straight and the people began to rush him he said they were reaching for that jacket he said it was not the jacket it was not the man in the jacket it was Christ that they had faith in and the very thing he was ashamed of was the very tool that God was using to bring forth his glory Hallelujah Hallelujah God is revealed in foolishness even brother Branham as humble as he was he's missing what God is doing brother Branham said we can't get that low brother Tim was talking about the third poll and brother random is fishing on the water and the Holy Spirit comes over that boat said call that little fish to life that fish was a minnow that fish was a bait fish none of us have feeling for baked fish I'm glad that was not my lot life but God knew it he stood up and said little fishy Jesus Christ gives you your life and that that fish that laid there for a half hour come back to life and swam down to the water he said God was showing he cares about the littlest things he knows what you were praying brother he knows every one of you many times we feel like we can slip through the cracks but the youngest of us God knows our needs and God answers our prayers because God cares about the widows God cares about the old people they're losing their health and losing their hair and and people they kind of move on life is Fast and the old get left behind but God is watching God restores that little fish to show his resurrection power on the least we can experience his resurrection power tonight anyone in this building can experience his resurrection power my brother Bradham said we must yield ourselves to the spirit of God he said we must yield ourselves every one of us he said that's God's heroes or those that are weak and God will make them strong out of the weakness of humility God chooses his people to build his kingdom he said if we ever get to heaven if we ever stand in the presence of God with his church we'll stand in a bunch of people that has been weak rejected cast out by the worlds and know it nothings and God molds himself into the helpless this is why Hannah when she prayed and God opened her womb she goes you raise us out of the dunghill how many have been raised out of the dunge Hill some of you sitting in a bar somewhere would have been out of your mind on crack cocaine but God has restored your mind God did not forget you Hallelujah out of weakness our weakness is God's opportunity I'm getting to the heart of my thought Israel God could do no more with them he had become common they had prospered so much that they had fallen into sin and God sent Prophet after Prophet trying to pull him back they would not listen God raised up Jeremiah and said God is finished 70 years you'll go into captivity Babylon will take over he said but after 70 years God in his grace he placed a word over Israel I will bring you back Hallelujah he was left up to Israel they never would have got back but God placed a word over them and after 70 years God anointed Cyrus and we could spend a long time on Cyrus amazing person in the Bible but God stirred the heart of Cyrus and Cyrus is pressed to perform the word of the Lord because there was a word that God placed upon Israel and he'll make even his enemies to be at peace and he calls Cyrus to have a burden to see Israel go back to her Homeland and worship and so in 536 BC a Remnant returns and zerubbabel is with him and zerubbabel begins to build the foundations then under great opposition from the enemy the work was postponed for seven years and then God stirred them up again to finish their work can we pull up Zechariah Chapter 4 Verse 8. uh eight through ten if you can praise the Lord everybody love the Lord he said and this is our opening scripture he said moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house and His Hands shall also finish it and thou shall know that the Lord of hosts has sent me unto you for who hath despised the day of small things this signifies the poor beginnings of the rebuilding of the Temple the Small Beginnings they were they were weak they had no friends that's why they were taunted by their enemy what will these feeble Jews do will they resurrect the temple out of the ashes and they're taunting them but there was a word placed over them and the devil is in opposition trying to slow them down and he said who hath despised the day of Small Beginnings who has despised even though it's small and insignificant God was involved in its beginnings and that's what's going to make it a success and then he said and he shall see like who is despised verse 10 who is despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubbabel with those seven they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro the whole Earth now is the ruble they're saying now they're despised because of their slow Small Beginnings God working in simplicity God using nobodies just people look like they're just barely scratching it but then they shall rejoice to see the plummet in the hand of zerubbabel who was the architect under God and they're watching he's saying these Small Beginnings will develop into the Fulfillment of the restoration of my temple and the Fulfillment of my word Hallelujah not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord brother random said this was prophetic of our hour brother random had used this scripture to preach the message of Grace and he said now we know that this was the preparation and the restoration of the Temple and zerubbabel was a great Prince among the people who had laid the foundation of the building he said now I want you to put on your spiritual thinking he said notice he was determined the great Prince to rebuild the house of the Lord and when he did he laid the foundation stone but then he went on to say zerubbabel laid the foundation he shall also bring forth The Headstone he said now think of this for a few minutes everyone stay with me he said the Sabbath Church age messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers in other words he would rebuild the church in the power of God not by power not by might by my spirit saith the Lord he said the holy spirit will bring forth a church in the last days zerubbabel the prince with Joshua was to bring forth The Headstone he laid the foundation he took the people back to the foundation in type now the candlesticks we read about represented both Jewish and Gentile churches he said now he said just like the pyramid they worked that pyramid up he said Enoch must have built it but they did not have a headstone he said that's a type of the body of Christ he said that every one of those stones came together you could not run a razor blade in between those stones he said it is a type of the body of Christ that every stone in the body is caught by the holy spirit in Precision God has a place for you in the body of Christ it is the work of almighty God and we are drawing this one to this one this one to this one this one to this one and God is bringing his body together bringing his church together Machinery cannot do it it takes God to do that it is by the power of the Holy Spirit and the and the headstone is Christ now brother Branham said according to the prophecy there will be a headstone and that headstone when it comes the prince will cry Grace Grace to it it is not by works it is by the grace of God the message of Grace has been attacked by the devil he said but there is a Grace that has been sent to this hour and brother Branham said look at David built a temple and he said now I am living in a house and my Lord is out there under skins and he told Nathan I want to build him a house and Nathan prophesied to David and said David I took you from the sheep goat you were nothing nothing you would have been forgotten but I chose you and I set you as a king over Israel and it was David that had a desire to build a temple a Dwelling Place for almighty God brother brainer said these are types that are pointing to this day when the messenger of the hour would cry not by power not by might not by Man's power not by denomination but by the spirit of God it is the spirit of God that heals his people it is the spirit of God that leads his people it is the spirit of God that places you into the body of Christ it places me into the body of Christ and brother Branham said it takes the Simplicity of believing the Simplicity of believing God that brings us into this body Hallelujah if I love the Lord he bypassed Caiaphas he bypassed the Sanhedrin and he poured his Spirit upon a bunch of fishermen and tax collectors who hath despised the day the small things brother banham had in in the breach quoted this scripture he said who it despised the day of small things God revealed in simplicity God took us seventh grade a man with a seventh grade education and manifest the son of man on a level even the Bible don't record the Miracles that have been recorded in what has taken place in our day and it's so simple and so humble that you say how can't the people see it because it's too ridiculous it's the truth they're stumbling over something so small Hallelujah but I love the Lord God has sent us a simple message a simple gospel and brother Branham said now he said the angel that spoke to Zachariah said not by power not by might you will not accomplish anything in yourself but it's God's work in you it is the holy spirit that is revealed this message to you it was never you it was always God and the same God that put a word in Abraham that put a word in Sarah that put a word as put a word in his church the same God that put a word in Moses has put a word on you God has started his work in you and now God will bring it to completion brother random said God brought us from justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost now coming to the cap where that bunch is honed out and it can fit a Ministry like he had when he went away it'll catch us into the rapture we are Justified Sanctified baptized with the Holy Ghost the house of God will live again Hallelujah by grace are you saved through faith not of yourselves it is the gift of God you are his workmanship how many believe that how many believe that God has started to work in your life how many know that with all their heart how many know I'm not where I want to be but I'm not where I used to be it's because God started the work but we should not be getting discouraged as the hour is darker and darker it is a faithless generation it is an adulterous generation but God has placed a word over this bride and it don't matter how dark it gets God has started a work in this church it's God in you it's God that has done it and God will complete it God has laid your foundation God has set your pillars God will bring forth the Capstone in your life Hallelujah it was never you in the beginning you're not holding on to God God is holding on to you I don't believe in loose living I believe in holy living but I believe it is the Holy Ghost In You I don't believe you're living your own Holiness I believe it is the Holy Ghost living through you Hallelujah if I love the Lord seven golden candlesticks that's what Zachariah Saw made of pure gold John said it was beaten work the True Church of Jesus Christ is likened unto pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes is his glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is we are to reflect what he is she is to manifest there is no fault in her she is all glorious within and without from beginning to end she is the work of the Lord how many believe you're the work of the Lord [Applause] Hallelujah all of his works are perfect in fact in her is summed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God in her summed up the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God that means god deposited his word everybody catch that how can one fathom it how can one understand it though we cannot do it we can accept it by faith because God has spoken it he said now she is beaten like beaten gold she is handcrafted according to the blueprints that our spirit given according to the blueprints that has been Spirit given have you been baptized in Jesus Christ's name have you come under the revelation of the hour and walked and delighted as God has given you the light Hallelujah God has done something great among us all brother Branham said outside her Lord and Master Jesus Christ was there ever a people so beaten and purged as the Bride of Jesus Christ God takes nothing and make something beautiful God has raised us up out of the ashes of laodocia rainbow flags are flying everywhere infidels are ruling the church as the government is utterly corrupted the world is falling apart and God goes in and deposits a word in this Dark Age and it has nothing to do with you has everything to do with God how many believe it what you got to do you're not swimming until you jump in and accept it amen I want to believe it I want to believe it come on Jump On In Jump On In you'll find you are born to swim You Are Born to Fly God make you to do it Hallelujah brother random said we have the earnest and our spirit is groaning for the full adoption we have the earneston of it now it is the earnest of our adoption or our complete salvation we are waiting for the fullness of adoption that will take place at the resurrection the same holy spirit that saved the lutherans that Sanctified the methodists that baptized the Pentecostals is Now setting in order the coming of the Lord Jesus when it will be so powerful that body will come into this group of church that'll draw the rest of them from the grave there will be a resurrection that is what the Holy Ghost has given for what is the Holy Ghost without us they cannot be made perfect when the enemy comes in like a flood the Lord will lift a standard God will lift a standard it's God pouring his spirit it's God moving God is waiting on you God is waiting on adoption time when he can pour His fullness his power his resurrection and the church becomes so close to Christ that Christ becomes visible among us and we go in the rapture God placed a word in you in the Book of Revelation it says in the seventh age he that saith thee amen he said what does the amen mean it means the so be it it means what God started in Genesis God will finish it in Revelation let it be so what God started God will finish the Bible said God will finish his work how many believe that brother random said now let's hear the cap of it all according to Malachi 4 he promised to send in the last days he has predestinated a church knowing they are standing with a seed that has been sown he said the holy spirit is in the church he said Satan be careful why did he say that Satan be careful because the word has been sown and it has found good ground and and everything we have need of is in the seed and the seed will bring forth of itself I know we try our best but that's what not what it's about it's believing God will fulfill his work healing does not come from you it comes from believing God will fulfill his word coming out of the strongholds of the Mind battles and depression anxiety and fear and nervousness does not come from your overcoming so much as believing that God will bring you up it is overcoming but it's believing in the overcomer and we are more than Overcomers how many believes he does all things well the Bible said as Heaven is higher than the earth so my ways are higher than your ways and my thoughts higher than your thoughts so shall be my word that cometh out of my mouth it will not return void it will accomplish that where I sent it yeah praise the Lord now watch this Zechariah cries who art thou oh Mountain before it's a rubable then he placed a word against that mountain that mountain shall become a plane we are up against mountains of opposition we're in the most unbelieving Dark Age the world has ever seen false doctrines isms are everywhere they're on the increase worldliness a worldlyism and materialism is on an increase it's it's just mind-blowing even among our own the spiritual climate is in a decline the world is getting darker crazier and time is running out living in a total Dark Age we are going against the current but God has placed a word in The Darkest Hour in the weakest generation how is God going to pull out his masterpiece out of something like this who art thou whole Mountain before zerubbabel what is it that stands before your victory what is it that stands between you and the promise God has promised peace God has promised victory God has promised an answer why can't we get an answer why can't I get peace why can't I reach my healing why can I not receive what I'm looking for who art thou o mountain that stands before zeroopable who art that enemy that will try to defy God's word they will try to stand in the way of your victory that God has promised you who art thou old mountain before is Aruba it don't matter how great they are me how great the opposition how big Goliath the word has been placed against our enemy thou shall be made a plane I will make your way clear how many believe that brother Branham said we are coming over to the promised land and every Mountain must crumble every sickness must crumble every demon must crumble every obstacle must crumble every lion Spirit must crumble who art thou Old Mountain before zeroopable I want you to say it to your mountain tonight who are you that'll stand up for me God has made me God has a purpose in me some of us need to be like jock a bed that you gotta let go of it and commit it to God committed to death and God will bring the resurrection we have got to let go of our children put them in God's hands and watch God bring them back we've got a place on our trials in the hands of God then quit trying to hold on to it ourselves come on jock a bit sit on out there alligators and towels are switching but God is greater God sends the Holy Spirit to escort you through they don't see a

can imagine she goes in Jesus name all the crocodile smell starts swarming she could have panicked and run back out there and grabbed it but she didn't she said Lord into thine hands I come in this

comes the queen I've just got to get a bath baby and Angel fans her heart flutters and she falls in love she picks him up and draws him from the water just like God true you are he said I have a predestinated plan because I'm going to raise up delivers in the last age that will deliver people from bondage of sickness and unbelief that will be lights in the darkness and will fulfill my Great
