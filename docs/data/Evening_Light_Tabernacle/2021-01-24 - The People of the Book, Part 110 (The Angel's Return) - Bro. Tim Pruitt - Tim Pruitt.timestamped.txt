[1:00:35] for me right now this moment
[1:00:39] i wanted to mention to the church that
[1:00:42] on
[1:00:43] thursday i believe it was brother john
[1:00:46] belk
[1:00:47] slipped away to be with the lord and
[1:00:51] he will have a graveside service on
[1:00:54] tuesday
[1:00:55] at 2 p.m at welcome cemetery just north
[1:00:59] of spring hill
[1:01:01] on highway 371 it's on the left side
[1:01:04] just across the state line
[1:01:06] so that'll be 2 p.m tuesday
[1:01:11] brother john come to us
[1:01:14] many years ago now probably
[1:01:18] it was after building the new church
[1:01:22] and then after the uh there on white oak
[1:01:25] when we built it back in
[1:01:27] 96 and then somewhere around 2000 we
[1:01:32] we did a fellowship hall and and at that
[1:01:35] time
[1:01:37] i had baptized brother john in the name
[1:01:41] of the lord jesus christ and god had
[1:01:43] delivered him from
[1:01:44] a cigarette habit other things that was
[1:01:48] in his life
[1:01:50] and did a miracle in his life and we're
[1:01:52] thankful for that
[1:01:54] and through the years he was um
[1:01:57] custodian of the church out there and
[1:02:00] um he was a real blessing to us
[1:02:03] we want to thank the lord for his life
[1:02:06] and his testimony and the blessing that
[1:02:08] he was to us
[1:02:09] but he slipped across the curtain a
[1:02:12] couple of months ago now he had a stroke
[1:02:14] and
[1:02:15] left him paralyzed on i think his right
[1:02:18] side
[1:02:20] and um he didn't want to live like that
[1:02:23] so
[1:02:23] the other day the lord granted his
[1:02:25] desire and let him slip across the
[1:02:27] curtain
[1:02:28] where that there is no crippled
[1:02:31] condition
[1:02:31] you're not prisoner in your own body
[1:02:34] amen with his complete and total healing
[1:02:37] and we thank the lord for that we also
[1:02:40] have
[1:02:40] ma ingram that is on hospice and
[1:02:44] i understand could go anytime so you
[1:02:47] know some of our elders are slipping
[1:02:49] away from us
[1:02:50] brother john wasn't really that old
[1:02:52] about 74 i think
[1:02:54] but um anyway he slipped away and
[1:02:57] he's on the other side waiting now and
[1:02:59] we just want to just take a moment
[1:03:01] just thank god for this life and for his
[1:03:04] testimony
[1:03:06] and i know the blessing that he was to
[1:03:08] you
[1:03:09] many of you and to the church
[1:03:12] body here amen let's just power heads
[1:03:15] for a moment
[1:03:16] [Music]
[1:03:32] lord as we just stop and reflect for a
[1:03:34] moment
[1:03:36] of a life that was among us
[1:03:39] a soldier that journeyed with us for a
[1:03:42] time
[1:03:44] it seems like lord in life's journey
[1:03:49] different ones get on the train and down
[1:03:52] the
[1:03:53] down the journey somewhere they get off
[1:03:58] and it's their time to go
[1:03:59] [Music]
[1:04:04] and we've had many lord that you've come
[1:04:06] for
[1:04:07] as i've said the lord is coming
[1:04:10] he may come for you today
[1:04:14] lord we know you came for brother john
[1:04:17] the other day
[1:04:20] as i sat in a and talked with him in his
[1:04:24] nursing home room and he was so animated
[1:04:28] and he beamed
[1:04:29] with joy to have our company
[1:04:33] and tried to tell me something though i
[1:04:36] couldn't understand
[1:04:37] anything he's had but lord now
[1:04:41] he's in a place where there is no
[1:04:44] inhibitions there's no complexes
[1:04:47] there's no hurts and injuries along the
[1:04:50] road and
[1:04:51] things that warps us in our mind and our
[1:04:54] character
[1:04:55] that makes us different and eccentric
[1:04:59] but lord oh god a place where there's
[1:05:01] just
[1:05:02] purity and holiness and goodness
[1:05:05] and kindness and where that we're all
[1:05:08] dressed alike
[1:05:09] in that old great white flowing robe
[1:05:12] of immortality lord
[1:05:16] he's joined the ranks of those that are
[1:05:19] now waiting on the other side
[1:05:21] who will soon come to us and then once
[1:05:24] we gather together we'll meet the lord
[1:05:27] in the air
[1:05:28] i pray lord that you'll comfort his
[1:05:31] family and give strength to them during
[1:05:33] this time
[1:05:34] his loved ones lord as many friends that
[1:05:36] he left behind
[1:05:38] lord i pray also from all ingram

[1:05:56] angels come for her
[1:05:58] that she not suffer long in this body

[1:06:05] what
[1:06:05] measure for what purpose when
[1:06:08] when they still gonna have to die if
[1:06:11] time carries
[1:06:12] and they would be here in these old
[1:06:14] decrepit bodies
[1:06:16] for you would not make us young again
[1:06:17] though you would heal us you would just

[1:09:23] of man
[1:09:24] they did eat they drank they married
[1:09:26] wives they were given in marriage
[1:09:28] and to the day that noah entered into
[1:09:30] the ark
[1:09:32] and the flood came and destroyed them
[1:09:34] all
[1:09:35] likewise also as it was in the days of
[1:09:38] lot they did eat they drank they bought
[1:09:40] they sold
[1:09:40] they planted they built it but the same
[1:09:44] day that lot went out of sodom it rained
[1:09:46] fire and brimstone from heaven
[1:09:49] and destroyed them all even thus shall
[1:09:51] it be in the day
[1:09:53] when the son of man is revealed
[1:09:56] and that day which he which shall be
[1:09:58] upon the house topped up in
[1:10:01] the house let him not come down to take
[1:10:03] it away he that is in the field let him
[1:10:06] not
[1:10:06] let him likewise not return back
[1:10:09] remember
[1:10:10] lot's wife whosoever
[1:10:13] shall seek to save his life shall lose
[1:10:17] it and whosoever shall lose his life
[1:10:20] shall preserve it i tell you that in
[1:10:22] that night there shall be two men
[1:10:24] in one bed the one taken and the other
[1:10:27] left two women shall be grinding
[1:10:28] together the one shall be taken the
[1:10:31] other left two men shall be in the field
[1:10:33] one taken
[1:10:34] the other left and they answered and
[1:10:36] said unto him
[1:10:38] where lord and he said unto them
[1:10:40] wheresoever the body
[1:10:42] is therefore there will the eagles
[1:10:46] be gathered amen and then also
[1:10:50] in genesis chapter 18 and verse
[1:10:53] 1 we'd like to read from there
[1:10:56] we've been reading this portion but i'm
[1:10:59] going to read
[1:11:00] several verses from chapter 18 this
[1:11:03] morning again
[1:11:04] and the lord appeared unto him in the
[1:11:06] plains of mamrie
[1:11:08] and he sat in the tent door in the heat
[1:11:10] of the day
[1:11:11] and he lift up his eyes and looked and
[1:11:14] lo
[1:11:15] three men stood by him and when he saw
[1:11:17] them he ran to meet them from the tent
[1:11:19] door
[1:11:20] and bowed himself toward the ground and
[1:11:23] he said my lord
[1:11:24] if now i have found favor in thy sight
[1:11:28] pass not away i pray thee from thy
[1:11:30] servant verse 10
[1:11:32] and he said i will certainly return unto
[1:11:35] thee according to the time of life
[1:11:38] and lo sarah that's wife will have a son
[1:11:42] and sarah heard it in the tent door
[1:11:44] which was behind him
[1:11:45] now abraham and sarah were old and well
[1:11:47] stricken in age and it ceased to be with
[1:11:49] sarah
[1:11:50] after the manner of women therefore
[1:11:53] sarah laughed within herself
[1:11:55] saying after i am waxed old shall i have
[1:11:58] pleasure my lord being old also
[1:12:00] and the lord said unto abraham wherefore
[1:12:04] did sarah laugh
[1:12:05] saying shall i of surety
[1:12:08] bear a child which emold
[1:12:11] is anything too hard for the lord at the
[1:12:15] time appointed
[1:12:16] i will return unto thee according to the
[1:12:19] time of life
[1:12:21] and sarah shall have a son may god bless
[1:12:24] you you can be seated
[1:12:26] we're going to be speaking this morning
[1:12:28] on the angel's
[1:12:29] return i sincerely believe that
[1:12:33] this is the day of the angel's
[1:12:36] visitation
[1:12:38] and all these players of this scene that
[1:12:41] we have
[1:12:42] looked at of abraham's day is a prophecy
[1:12:45] of the end time
[1:12:47] and even jesus would use this and
[1:12:50] prophesy of when the son of man is
[1:12:52] revealed when the word is revealed
[1:12:55] that it would be a time as it was in the
[1:12:59] days of lot and of course you can't have
[1:13:00] the days a lot without having the days
[1:13:02] of abraham
[1:13:04] but all of these are all of these
[1:13:06] characters are
[1:13:08] and players of this scene and abraham's
[1:13:11] day
[1:13:12] is a prophecy of the end time
[1:13:16] i i hope that you will always look at
[1:13:18] your bible
[1:13:19] as a prophecy when you read your bible
[1:13:23] remember it's more than just a story
[1:13:25] it's more than just
[1:13:26] a a historical account
[1:13:30] um or in the details of um
[1:13:34] of jewish people in the jewish race
[1:13:37] but it actually is god was writing a
[1:13:40] prophecy
[1:13:41] in their lives that is to be fulfilled
[1:13:44] in this end time
[1:13:46] now in the bible these men and women
[1:13:48] were playing out
[1:13:49] of a prophecy to be fulfilled
[1:13:52] and and there's hardly a character that
[1:13:55] is
[1:13:56] listed without a direct relation
[1:14:00] to our day you see we are in the seventh
[1:14:04] seal
[1:14:04] now that may sound a little strange but
[1:14:07] you know when we say the seventh seal
[1:14:10] and everybody knows it's a half hour of
[1:14:12] silence it is a time where
[1:14:15] god silenced something and it was to be
[1:14:18] for a space of time and that space of
[1:14:22] time
[1:14:22] actually was um you know would go into
[1:14:26] several thousand years and church ages
[1:14:29] where god would
[1:14:30] hold on secret a great
[1:14:33] mystery where god would hold
[1:14:37] on secret a great mystery
[1:14:40] and and it would be the mystery of the
[1:14:43] end time when you look at the seventh
[1:14:45] seal it is synonymous with the coming of
[1:14:47] the lord
[1:14:49] and it is it is of course i'm opening up
[1:14:53] the
[1:14:53] end time process it's the beginning
[1:14:56] of the end and it's where that god
[1:14:59] reveals what he's been doing to the ages
[1:15:03] to make it plain to us in this last day
[1:15:05] of why we are here and how we got here
[1:15:09] and then where we are going and what is
[1:15:12] our day
[1:15:12] and our hour in our visitation so we're
[1:15:15] in a very special time
[1:15:17] where it is no longer silent but where
[1:15:20] the silence has been broken
[1:15:23] where now the mysteries of god have been
[1:15:25] finished
[1:15:27] and god has let you in
[1:15:30] on things that other generations only
[1:15:33] long to see and understand now
[1:15:37] when we speak of this as prophecies in
[1:15:39] these lives
[1:15:40] you know abraham was not let in on
[1:15:42] knowing that there was going to be
[1:15:45] um four or five thousand more years of
[1:15:48] world history and he was only a player
[1:15:51] on the
[1:15:52] scene and prophesying of another
[1:15:54] generation he was not told
[1:15:56] now when you're doing this i want you to
[1:15:58] understand why you're taking isaac upon
[1:16:01] this mountain and
[1:16:02] why you're going to sacrifice him and
[1:16:05] your only son
[1:16:06] and why you're why he's carrying the
[1:16:08] wood on his shoulders and
[1:16:10] why he's acting he did not realize he
[1:16:13] was
[1:16:13] acting out something or prophesying of
[1:16:17] event
[1:16:18] that would happen with the seed of
[1:16:20] abraham
[1:16:21] some thousands of years later and but
[1:16:24] you know god did lady man on the clue he
[1:16:27] said
[1:16:27] he said this is jehovah jireh or in the
[1:16:30] mount of the lord it shall be seen in
[1:16:33] the same mountain
[1:16:34] this scene will repeat again one day and
[1:16:37] so
[1:16:37] it was you know little revelations and
[1:16:40] things but they couldn't quite
[1:16:41] see the picture you know there were was
[1:16:44] a veil
[1:16:45] over their eyes because brother branham
[1:16:48] said god will hold us
[1:16:50] blind to things until the time that we
[1:16:52] have need of it
[1:16:54] and so we must be in great need in this
[1:16:57] last age
[1:16:59] in order to be a people who has faith
[1:17:01] for god to unveil
[1:17:03] so many things to us because this is a
[1:17:06] time
[1:17:07] of the unveiling of god not the cover
[1:17:10] up or the hiding of the secret of god
[1:17:13] this
[1:17:13] is where a people is brought into the
[1:17:16] very secrets of god because
[1:17:18] she is a pride of marriage age of whom
[1:17:21] he is
[1:17:22] drawn up next to himself to whisper the
[1:17:24] love secrets to
[1:17:26] isn't that amazing that god would let
[1:17:29] you in
[1:17:30] on secrets that other ages only
[1:17:33] long to see and yet he would say
[1:17:36] blessed are your eyes for they see and
[1:17:39] blessed are your
[1:17:40] ears for they hear for prophets and wise
[1:17:43] men and sages
[1:17:44] have longed to see your day and has
[1:17:48] not seen them what an hour we're
[1:17:51] privileged to live in
[1:17:53] now so god that you know again
[1:17:57] brought us now to this space of time
[1:18:01] in fact of the matter is you know the
[1:18:04] seventh seal would begin
[1:18:05] with the angels of god and we'll come
[1:18:07] into that maybe in a later sermon
[1:18:10] that uh that in my studies if god will
[1:18:12] permit it
[1:18:13] but here there he but the seven angels
[1:18:15] would come and
[1:18:16] and um and break open the seventh seal
[1:18:20] and when it's happened and
[1:18:21] he would send it back you know to reveal
[1:18:24] um
[1:18:25] all the other seals because it's the
[1:18:27] time
[1:18:28] of the breaking of the silence and so
[1:18:31] um this breaking of the seal or the
[1:18:34] silence
[1:18:34] god had a silent hidden mystery
[1:18:38] in almost every character of the bible
[1:18:41] you see the characters of the bible
[1:18:43] would actually
[1:18:44] live out the plan of redemption
[1:18:48] and you know whether it be the coming
[1:18:50] redeemer or his bride
[1:18:52] or the church for example you know david
[1:18:55] would there
[1:18:56] get in a straight as a as um reflecting
[1:18:59] the son of david and
[1:19:00] he would say my god my god why hast i
[1:19:03] forsaken me and
[1:19:04] my bones they stare at me and they
[1:19:07] parted my garments and
[1:19:08] and they they pierced my hands and my
[1:19:11] feet and
[1:19:12] all kinds of things that he would
[1:19:13] prophesy under the spirit
[1:19:15] actually groaning speaking of it as if
[1:19:18] it was himself
[1:19:20] but he was actually experiencing things
[1:19:23] that would cause him to prophesy
[1:19:26] out of his life things that would happen
[1:19:29] in the son of david so you would see
[1:19:32] characters in the bible that
[1:19:34] are that explicitly um live out and
[1:19:38] portray
[1:19:39] the end time prophecies in other words
[1:19:42] they would be speaking of you this is
[1:19:45] why
[1:19:45] in revelation 19 that he has granted us
[1:19:49] to be arrayed in whiteland and clean and
[1:19:52] white
[1:19:52] which is the righteousness of the saints
[1:19:55] so their
[1:19:56] righteous acts the things that they were
[1:19:58] doing we are now being dressed in it
[1:20:01] are you with me so we are now wearing
[1:20:04] this very scene or in other words we are
[1:20:06] the character
[1:20:07] wearing abraham and sarah's close and
[1:20:10] been living in this time
[1:20:12] now it's not a prophecy now it is a
[1:20:14] fulfillment of prophecy
[1:20:17] because they prophesied and you are the
[1:20:20] fulfillment
[1:20:22] amen so therefore we can say this day
[1:20:25] this scripture is fulfilled or is in the
[1:20:29] process of being fulfilled
[1:20:31] amen now as we look at this
[1:20:35] you know god purpose to do this to a
[1:20:40] purpose this to prophetical class of
[1:20:42] people
[1:20:43] to reveal the bible as a prophecy
[1:20:48] not as just a history the opening of the
[1:20:51] seals and the breaking of the silences
[1:20:54] reveals the mystery that is hidden in
[1:20:57] every bible character so whether it be
[1:21:02] whether it be isaac and rebecca and the
[1:21:04] elies are going together and
[1:21:06] all the other different scenes of the
[1:21:08] bible you know ruth and
[1:21:09] and boaz and and and the kinsmen
[1:21:12] redeemer and that whole
[1:21:14] story and esther or whoever it is
[1:21:18] unknowing to themselves they were
[1:21:20] prophesying
[1:21:22] of another age now i would say
[1:21:26] that you are not prophesying you are
[1:21:30] fulfilled
[1:21:32] because there's not another age to come
[1:21:36] to fulfill the prophecies so we are not
[1:21:39] typing out another age but well yeah
[1:21:43] rather we are fulfilling all the types
[1:21:46] that has been spoke of this age now
[1:21:50] of course you know as we see that
[1:21:53] much of the bible speaks of the groom it
[1:21:56] speaks of the bride because they're all
[1:21:57] one person
[1:21:59] so therefore he will prophesy christ in
[1:22:01] a prophesy of his bride but although
[1:22:04] either way is it's prophesying of the
[1:22:06] same person
[1:22:07] and his plan of redemption now
[1:22:10] in christ a mystery brother adam tells
[1:22:13] us that
[1:22:14] god had a purpose and a hidden mystery
[1:22:18] and the hidden mystery that he had in
[1:22:20] his mind before the world began
[1:22:22] and he said how that has unfolded itself
[1:22:26] down to this present hour that we're
[1:22:28] living
[1:22:29] and he said then you will understand
[1:22:31] clearly or you see
[1:22:33] on i believe what is being done
[1:22:36] he said god's great mystery of how it's
[1:22:39] a secret he kept it a secret
[1:22:41] nobody knew nothing about it even the
[1:22:44] angels didn't understand it
[1:22:46] and i can imagine the angels watching a
[1:22:49] lot of the events
[1:22:50] and saying god why did you do it this
[1:22:53] way
[1:22:54] because it wasn't it wasn't revealed to
[1:22:57] the angels
[1:22:58] of what god was doing it was kept
[1:23:01] secret until the time of his coming and
[1:23:05] i want to
[1:23:06] get something in your heart this morning
[1:23:08] that we are
[1:23:09] living in the time of his coming
[1:23:13] and that time of his coming is not a
[1:23:16] singular event
[1:23:18] see we often have looked at the rapture
[1:23:20] as being a singular event
[1:23:22] it is not it is a it is a um
[1:23:26] an explosion of events one thing will
[1:23:28] happen
[1:23:29] cause another happen this will happen to
[1:23:31] cause another and this will happen
[1:23:32] another
[1:23:33] and another another another until it's
[1:23:35] all fulfilled
[1:23:37] now so you see as he said
[1:23:40] um god's great mystery even the angels
[1:23:43] didn't understand it
[1:23:45] he didn't reveal it that's why the
[1:23:47] reason under our
[1:23:48] seventh mystery when the seventh seal
[1:23:51] was open
[1:23:52] there was silence you see because god
[1:23:54] held it a mystery
[1:23:56] and jesus when he was on earth they
[1:23:59] wanted to know
[1:23:59] when he would come and he said even the
[1:24:02] son himself
[1:24:03] don't know when it's going to happen see
[1:24:06] god has all this to himself
[1:24:08] it is a secret so even jesus as a man
[1:24:12] was not privy to knowing his return
[1:24:16] amen he would be after his death burial
[1:24:18] and resurrection when he goes back
[1:24:21] into the form of the pillar of fire he
[1:24:23] comes back to john
[1:24:25] on the isle of patmos to reveal to him
[1:24:27] his coming
[1:24:29] are you with me now but it would be
[1:24:31] written in mysteries
[1:24:35] because it wasn't for the other ages
[1:24:39] god haven't reserved the last book of
[1:24:41] the bible for you
[1:24:46] hallelujah if you just stop and think of
[1:24:48] it the book of acts was
[1:24:50] written of a people two thousand years
[1:24:52] ago matthew mark luke and john was
[1:24:54] written of a people
[1:24:55] two thousand years ago but the book of
[1:24:57] revelation has been written about you
[1:25:01] it is actually your book a prophecy
[1:25:06] now as we think of this
[1:25:11] he says god has all this to himself it
[1:25:14] is a secret
[1:25:15] that's the reason there was silence in
[1:25:16] heaven for space of half hour
[1:25:18] and seven thunders under their voices
[1:25:20] john was even forbidden to write at sea
[1:25:23] the coming of the lord and that's one
[1:25:25] thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he
[1:25:27] will come and when he will come and it's
[1:25:29] a good thing he doesn't
[1:25:30] no he has shown it or revealed it
[1:25:34] in every type that's in the bible
[1:25:37] so now there of course there is that
[1:25:39] portion
[1:25:40] of that seventh seal that we won't know
[1:25:42] until we are
[1:25:44] changed till the dead and christ rise
[1:25:47] but yet there are other portions of it
[1:25:50] he said it was in three different parts
[1:25:52] it was that third pull
[1:25:54] which is his message it was so seven
[1:25:56] thunder sounded right in a row which was
[1:25:58] the opening of the seventh seal
[1:26:00] and he said the last part of it went
[1:26:02] forth and in tongues and he said
[1:26:04] i couldn't understand what it said and
[1:26:07] of course
[1:26:08] that's the day and hour of when he
[1:26:10] returns
[1:26:11] and god holds that great mystery i'm
[1:26:13] glad he did
[1:26:15] that he held it a mystery because you
[1:26:17] know i have been preaching
[1:26:19] like you know with fervency and
[1:26:21] diligence
[1:26:22] since i was a 15 year old boy because i
[1:26:24] looked for jesus to come that year
[1:26:27] amen brother and but god held that part
[1:26:30] bail to me and to you
[1:26:34] amen because if satan would have got a
[1:26:36] hold of it
[1:26:37] he'd have done great damage with it if
[1:26:39] the church would have been
[1:26:40] dilatory and lazy and said well we got
[1:26:43] 50 years to go
[1:26:45] you know we so we we can just kind of
[1:26:47] rest on our laurels and
[1:26:49] and twiddle our thumbs and wait and you
[1:26:51] know it'll come in it's time 50 years
[1:26:54] down the road and if i ain't ready yet
[1:26:56] i've got 50 years to get ready
[1:26:59] but god holds that part a great secret
[1:27:03] amen so that you will be
[1:27:05] continue did you remember timothy's
[1:27:07] sermon the other night
[1:27:09] the the one of the very key words
[1:27:12] of jesus coming and his return
[1:27:16] is watch
[1:27:19] watch over and again this word is
[1:27:23] associated with this coming
[1:27:24] watch watch watch
[1:27:30] because god wants us to have a watchful
[1:27:32] attitude
[1:27:35] amen he doesn't want us falling asleep
[1:27:38] he wants us doing our work work while
[1:27:41] it's day
[1:27:44] amen he said because the night's coming
[1:27:45] when no man can work
[1:27:47] so you see only only time we can do the
[1:27:50] work for god is right now while we're in
[1:27:52] this flesh
[1:27:53] this is what brother branham said this
[1:27:55] is the only time i preach the gospel is
[1:27:57] immortal
[1:27:58] i know people are expecting him to come
[1:28:00] back and do this and that well
[1:28:02] he said the only only time i'll ever
[1:28:04] preach is as a mortal it's my only
[1:28:06] opportunity
[1:28:08] this is our opportunity to preach this
[1:28:10] is our opportunity
[1:28:11] to spread the good news this is the
[1:28:14] opportunity to be the sign
[1:28:16] before the world that jesus christ is
[1:28:19] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:28:21] now but but he said you know it
[1:28:24] said that this one thing yet he hadn't
[1:28:26] revealed yet how he will come when he
[1:28:28] will come
[1:28:29] and it's a good thing he doesn't know he
[1:28:31] has
[1:28:32] showed it or revealed it and this is
[1:28:34] what i want to get to you
[1:28:35] in every type that's in the bible
[1:28:39] therefore the entire bible is a
[1:28:41] revelation of god's mystery in christ
[1:28:44] the entire bible is an expression of one
[1:28:47] goal
[1:28:48] that god had one purpose that he wanted
[1:28:52] to achieve
[1:28:53] in the entire bible and all the acts
[1:28:56] of the believers in the bibles has been
[1:28:59] in type
[1:29:00] expressing what god's great goal is and
[1:29:03] now in this last day
[1:29:04] he has revealed it and shows it
[1:29:08] so there is abraham that we see in this
[1:29:11] scene
[1:29:12] this prophecy he is the father of our
[1:29:15] faith
[1:29:16] he is sarah is his wife who is one with
[1:29:19] abraham
[1:29:21] and she is included with the promise
[1:29:24] although
[1:29:24] she can't quite believe that she's in
[1:29:27] the promise
[1:29:29] now brother branham told us that in
[1:29:31] abraham's journey
[1:29:32] that he had met god in all different
[1:29:34] forms
[1:29:35] and and he said we could they didn't
[1:29:37] show it because just we are abraham's
[1:29:39] seed if we're in christ and
[1:29:41] and isaac was really his lesser son he
[1:29:43] was his son
[1:29:44] sexually but spiritually christ was
[1:29:47] abraham's seed
[1:29:48] his royal seed his faith
[1:29:51] now we find this royal sea travels us
[1:29:54] the journey
[1:29:55] the same journey that the bride of
[1:29:57] christ travels the same journey
[1:30:00] that abraham did and the last sign that
[1:30:03] abraham seen before the promised son
[1:30:05] came
[1:30:06] was when god was manifested in a human
[1:30:10] body
[1:30:10] and two angels came down now
[1:30:14] luke 17 30 we read it said as it was
[1:30:17] in the days when the son of man is
[1:30:20] revealed
[1:30:21] now he comes in three sons name which is
[1:30:25] son of son of man which is a prophet son
[1:30:28] of god
[1:30:29] which uh through the church ages and
[1:30:32] brother branham always depicted that as
[1:30:34] the holy spirit
[1:30:35] god be in the spirit and he said then
[1:30:37] the son of david so he said in between
[1:30:40] the son of god and son of david
[1:30:42] according to his own word in malachi 4
[1:30:45] many scripture he's returned back into
[1:30:48] his church
[1:30:49] in a physical form in the people
[1:30:52] in human beings what's now in the way
[1:30:56] of being a prophet
[1:30:59] now noted not only is there to be a
[1:31:02] messenger who is to be a prophet
[1:31:04] that the son of man christ will manifest
[1:31:07] himself through but there will be a
[1:31:08] special
[1:31:09] class of people a super
[1:31:13] church now we have to be
[1:31:16] a prophetical class of people because
[1:31:20] the book
[1:31:21] the of the bible that specifically our
[1:31:24] book the book of revelation
[1:31:26] is the actual revelation of jesus
[1:31:29] himself in the church and his future
[1:31:32] work
[1:31:33] in the future ages and to understand it
[1:31:36] will take the holy spirit now
[1:31:40] so it will take a revelation
[1:31:43] and i want to just get this to you it'll
[1:31:45] have to come by an angel
[1:31:49] amen because it was revealed to john by
[1:31:52] an
[1:31:52] angel he said i i jesus have sent
[1:31:56] mine angel to testify these things
[1:32:00] so again it won't take just ordinary
[1:32:04] study
[1:32:05] and thinking to make the book of
[1:32:07] revelation real to us
[1:32:09] it's going to take the operation of the
[1:32:11] holy ghost
[1:32:13] that means there's got to be a
[1:32:14] prophetical class of people
[1:32:17] who can be moved by the spirit of god
[1:32:20] and that means that this book cannot be
[1:32:23] revealed to anyone but a special
[1:32:25] class of people let me just tell you
[1:32:28] right now the people of the book
[1:32:30] that's who it's written to it wasn't
[1:32:33] written to be
[1:32:33] understood by all the other other ones
[1:32:37] but the people of the book amen
[1:32:40] and it will take a people with
[1:32:42] prophetical
[1:32:43] insight that will require an ability to
[1:32:47] hear from god
[1:32:49] let me tell you in this age there has to
[1:32:53] be somebody
[1:32:54] with years to hear what the spirit is
[1:32:57] saying to the church
[1:32:58] there's got to be a people that is
[1:33:00] spiritually can spiritually discern
[1:33:03] the day and the hour that they are
[1:33:05] living in
[1:33:07] i want you to understand real clearly a
[1:33:09] people that can hear the voice of god
[1:33:11] of people that can discern the voice of
[1:33:14] god from
[1:33:15] all the other millions of voices that
[1:33:17] are in the world today
[1:33:19] and it will require instruction
[1:33:23] and not just a student comparing verse
[1:33:25] with birth so that's good but a mystery
[1:33:27] requires
[1:33:28] that teaching of the spirit or it never
[1:33:30] becomes clear
[1:33:32] so how we need to hear from god and lay
[1:33:34] ourselves open
[1:33:35] and become yielded to the spirit to know
[1:33:38] to hear
[1:33:38] and know and yeah i did read some of
[1:33:41] that from the churches book
[1:33:43] i paraphrased it now saw super race
[1:33:48] a super supersede a super sign
[1:33:54] a super prophecy with a super
[1:33:56] fulfillment
[1:33:58] a super race remember god would put it
[1:34:02] on the pen of the prophet
[1:34:04] of god to write in these last days the
[1:34:07] bride of christ
[1:34:09] the true bride christ or bride church
[1:34:11] christ seed
[1:34:12] will come to the headstone and she will
[1:34:14] be a super church
[1:34:16] a super race as she nears him they in
[1:34:19] the bride will be
[1:34:20] so much like him that they will even be
[1:34:23] in his
[1:34:24] very image this is in order to be united
[1:34:27] with them they will be
[1:34:28] one they will be the manifestation
[1:34:32] of the word of the living god so the
[1:34:35] word
[1:34:35] that's written in the bible they will
[1:34:37] manifest it
[1:34:39] whether it be of abraham of esther or
[1:34:42] rebecca or write down the
[1:34:43] you know through through any of the
[1:34:45] characters elijah elijah
[1:34:47] the double portion all of these things
[1:34:49] they are prophesied
[1:34:54] and you can look in the bible and you
[1:34:56] can read
[1:34:57] and we can say these search the
[1:35:00] scriptures
[1:35:01] for they are they that testify of me
[1:35:05] they tell of what i am to be
[1:35:08] in this end time and i want to remind
[1:35:10] you you may look at some of this
[1:35:11] and say i'm not that yet i'll tell you
[1:35:14] don't look at that
[1:35:15] look at what he said because you're
[1:35:17] going to be everything
[1:35:18] god said in his word you that you would
[1:35:21] be come on
[1:35:22] if he said you'll be a bride without
[1:35:24] spider-wrinkle
[1:35:25] and you say i've got some wrinkles and
[1:35:27] i've got some spots
[1:35:28] just know this this this god ain't gonna
[1:35:31] leave you
[1:35:32] and abandon you this god will continue
[1:35:35] working on you till he irons out all the
[1:35:37] wrinkles and he
[1:35:39] takes every spot and puts it in his
[1:35:41] blood
[1:35:43] because god's not about to abandon the
[1:35:46] work
[1:35:47] that he has started
[1:35:50] i'll tell you god has went through some
[1:35:52] tremendous efforts in this end time
[1:35:55] visit this age with an angel
[1:35:58] the angel of the covenant no less
[1:36:04] god's done some mighty things and let me
[1:36:08] just remind you
[1:36:09] he's abandoning his plan he's been
[1:36:12] waiting for this moment
[1:36:15] you think you're waiting for rapture
[1:36:17] he's been waiting for this moment
[1:36:20] for thousands of years before that in
[1:36:22] eternity
[1:36:23] when he had this plan in his mind and
[1:36:26] he's only now just opening up his heart
[1:36:28] and let you see in the back part of his
[1:36:30] mind what he had planned for you
[1:36:36] lord of god i thank god when he even
[1:36:38] when brother branham come down to the
[1:36:40] trumpets
[1:36:41] and him thinking there was going to be a
[1:36:43] squeeze and a persecution
[1:36:45] and all these things are rude about a
[1:36:47] squeeze and a persecution
[1:36:49] and i think and i think but god come
[1:36:51] down and say i got a greater plan
[1:36:53] and he shows the trumpets and when the
[1:36:55] trumpets are opened up he said it's not
[1:36:57] even to you at all the gentiles
[1:36:59] amen you'll go through none of that but
[1:37:01] the rapture
[1:37:02] that's the next thing for you he said
[1:37:06] his grace is
[1:37:07] so great upon you
[1:37:09] [Applause]
[1:37:15] the things that we're seeing are minor
[1:37:18] to the tribulation's coming
[1:37:23] it's time you make your call in an
[1:37:24] election sure
[1:37:27] because you're going to fit in one of
[1:37:28] these characters in this
[1:37:30] prophecy that we're going to be speaking
[1:37:32] about this morning
[1:37:35] the super sign brother branham said
[1:37:39] that he chose to come as abraham seed
[1:37:42] abraham's supersede said he could have
[1:37:44] come as an angel
[1:37:45] could have come you know um many
[1:37:47] different ways but
[1:37:48] whatever way he wished but he chose to
[1:37:50] come as abraham's supersede
[1:37:54] and that the way he chose to come to
[1:37:57] show in this last day
[1:37:59] god supersign and is super racial yes
[1:38:02] not what you call a super race
[1:38:04] but what god calls the super race
[1:38:08] because he got what supernatural power
[1:38:10] with supernatural
[1:38:11] signs to a supernatural belief in a
[1:38:14] supernatural word
[1:38:16] from a supernatural god in a
[1:38:18] supernatural body in a supernatural
[1:38:21] people
[1:38:22] giving him supernatural signs hallelujah
[1:38:25] of super race they that know their god
[1:38:28] shall do exploits great exploits
[1:38:30] and show supernatural signs of people
[1:38:33] abraham's seed
[1:38:34] a sign of the supernatural christ
[1:38:37] risen from the dead supernaturally
[1:38:42] now notice remember
[1:38:46] he come to get abraham to come to get
[1:38:49] sarah to believe him
[1:38:52] that was sarah her faith
[1:38:55] had drifted so far from the initial
[1:38:59] promise
[1:39:00] that she couldn't believe the news that
[1:39:03] she was going to bring forth the
[1:39:04] promised son
[1:39:06] it looked impossible after all of these
[1:39:09] years
[1:39:11] god still got a plan god still got a
[1:39:14] purpose for me
[1:39:16] god's still going to do something with
[1:39:18] this
[1:39:19] old bride
[1:39:22] come on that was sarah her faith had
[1:39:24] drifted away she she
[1:39:26] could think back over god's promise and
[1:39:28] she could not
[1:39:29] remember a time not even one
[1:39:34] specific occasion where that god said to
[1:39:36] her that she was to bear seed and
[1:39:38] that would inherit this land they only
[1:39:40] said that to abraham
[1:39:43] you see so many times we look in
[1:39:46] promises and
[1:39:47] we see that it's to christ or it was to
[1:39:50] the early church or it was to abraham or
[1:39:53] it was elijah and we can't hardly
[1:39:56] believe it's
[1:39:56] for me
[1:40:02] one problem was sarah had never met
[1:40:05] elohim herself
[1:40:08] amen she only heard of other occasions
[1:40:11] where god had come down to abraham
[1:40:13] and she believed that she had a faith
[1:40:16] for abraham i mean sarah had been
[1:40:20] promised and disappointed so many times
[1:40:25] and now she had come to terms with life
[1:40:27] by now
[1:40:28] she's 90 years old and she
[1:40:32] you know come on now you know how it
[1:40:34] would be
[1:40:35] she she would think oh maybe it's this
[1:40:37] month
[1:40:39] and then there would come another
[1:40:40] showing she wasn't pregnant
[1:40:43] and then maybe it's next month and then
[1:40:46] she'd hear of a special
[1:40:48] uh visitation with a maybe because he's
[1:40:50] come it'll be this month
[1:40:52] she'd be disappointed again you know
[1:40:56] and then then she gets in the time of
[1:40:59] life and
[1:41:00] you know maybe skip cycles and so on
[1:41:04] you know surely maybe maybe oh it's it's
[1:41:07] happening in the change of life only
[1:41:09] to be disappointed again
[1:41:12] do you know what i'm talking about we've
[1:41:15] had movements down to the age and it
[1:41:17] looks like
[1:41:18] this is going to be it it was luther
[1:41:21] and it looked like it was going to be in
[1:41:23] this movement and
[1:41:25] come on and then wesley and pentecost
[1:41:28] and
[1:41:29] the divine healing meetings and then
[1:41:32] we've even had
[1:41:33] little different false rises that's been
[1:41:36] in
[1:41:36] in in the the messaging on the seventh
[1:41:39] thunder movement
[1:41:41] and and and perusia movement and two
[1:41:44] lord movement seven thunder movement and
[1:41:46] and and and perusia movement and two
[1:41:49] lord movement and that surely it's gonna
[1:41:51] be
[1:41:52] gonna be here all of these things only
[1:41:54] to be disappointed
[1:41:57] only to see it just bring forth another
[1:42:00] wild child
[1:42:03] another child of a denomination some
[1:42:06] man-made system
[1:42:08] help me preach now i know i'm meddling a
[1:42:11] little bit but you're gonna have to
[1:42:13] hold tight this morning and then we're
[1:42:15] talking about a prophecy
[1:42:17] and from the first time that you know
[1:42:21] abram had come in from the fields where
[1:42:23] he was keeping the flocks and
[1:42:25] reported hey him honey elohim
[1:42:29] has spoken to millions promised me a
[1:42:31] seat
[1:42:32] you know sarah my love don't worry about
[1:42:35] your baroness
[1:42:37] don't worry that we've been married
[1:42:38] since you were 16 years old and
[1:42:41] we've been together you know i i was 26
[1:42:45] and you were 16 and god is promised me a
[1:42:48] son
[1:42:49] well you're gonna bring forth a child
[1:42:51] but you know
[1:42:53] now she's up in age and she is no longer
[1:42:57] looking for the fulfillment
[1:43:00] of the promise she's discouraged
[1:43:03] it'll never happen you know
[1:43:08] oh yes she believed it would all be
[1:43:11] fulfilled but
[1:43:12] just not by her
[1:43:16] and you know this kind of attitude even
[1:43:18] becomes with people
[1:43:21] when it becomes a delay of the promise
[1:43:25] even to delay that we are experiencing
[1:43:28] of the coming of the lord
[1:43:30] because that's another thing that's
[1:43:32] associated with his coming
[1:43:34] is delay that men will say
[1:43:38] the lord have delayed his coming that's
[1:43:40] coffee
[1:43:41] it gives and makes room for scoffers to
[1:43:44] rise and
[1:43:44] make fun and you know sarah you've been
[1:43:47] thinking this for
[1:43:48] since she was 16 and it ain't happened
[1:43:51] yet
[1:43:53] you've been looking a long time for it's
[1:43:55] coming in and you find people
[1:43:57] getting laughs and lazy and people
[1:43:59] becoming
[1:44:00] a deletory and slothful
[1:44:04] and and maybe a little bit down and out
[1:44:07] and
[1:44:07] depressed and you know
[1:44:10] the fervency isn't there and if you
[1:44:13] can't get them to come to church you
[1:44:15] know
[1:44:16] you just barely get them to clap their
[1:44:18] hands or praise the lord
[1:44:20] or whatever because they're
[1:44:23] they're just so weary of waiting
[1:44:34] and for too long sarah the church
[1:44:38] has not truly looked for the coming of
[1:44:40] the lord
[1:44:42] she has just been satisfied
[1:44:46] with letting hagar do it
[1:44:49] and hagar and her denominational child
[1:44:54] you know we just we'll just perpetuate
[1:44:58] the ages and be content
[1:45:01] with a child of our unbelief
[1:45:04] that's what denomination is it's a child
[1:45:08] of unbelief it's where people
[1:45:11] settle down instead of move on
[1:45:16] oh i'm preaching to a lot of
[1:45:17] denominational camps around the message
[1:45:20] right now
[1:45:21] did you just settle down and you've not
[1:45:23] moved in years
[1:45:25] i hear preachers sometimes brag and say
[1:45:27] i preach the same thing i have for 40
[1:45:30] years and i say shame on you there would
[1:45:32] have been
[1:45:33] some new inspiration down along the road
[1:45:35] somewhere
[1:45:36] there should have been a revelation from
[1:45:38] god how come you're going back to 40
[1:45:40] years
[1:45:41] and what about a church that states
[1:45:43] backslidden
[1:45:44] and cold and formal and not moving in
[1:45:48] the spirit
[1:45:49] [Applause]
[1:45:50] well we're back where we we're still
[1:45:52] where we were 40 years ago we're hanging
[1:45:55] on
[1:45:55] well i'll tell you why don't you turn
[1:45:57] loose once in a while
[1:45:59] and let god move you a little further
[1:46:01] than what you've been
[1:46:06] you know we just perpetuate the ages and
[1:46:09] be content with the child of our
[1:46:11] unbelief
[1:46:13] for years every movement where god moved
[1:46:15] with the promise
[1:46:17] only resulted in sarah giving up and
[1:46:19] offering her bonds made
[1:46:22] and form the denomination and bring
[1:46:24] forth the ishmael a wild man
[1:46:28] who won't be subject to the word
[1:46:32] i think some of the products of
[1:46:35] some of this preaching in the message
[1:46:38] that is produced
[1:46:40] backslidden offspring
[1:46:44] to don't have a zeal of fervency
[1:46:48] a desire their grandchildren of the
[1:46:52] message
[1:46:55] they're little ishmael lights and they
[1:46:58] show their rebellion you know they'll
[1:47:00] wear their makeup and theirs cut their
[1:47:01] hair and paint their face and
[1:47:03] do all their things you know because
[1:47:05] they're wild
[1:47:08] somebody gonna help me preach this
[1:47:10] morning don't hang up on me yet
[1:47:12] i got a lot of things to say amen now
[1:47:15] you see again in this prophecy
[1:47:19] there there is a hagar remember there's
[1:47:22] a lot of different characters and just
[1:47:24] what we're seeing abraham and sarah
[1:47:26] that make up this whole story and this
[1:47:28] whole prophecy there's a hagar
[1:47:30] she is a bones woman a man whose trial
[1:47:33] will
[1:47:34] never be air with the free woman
[1:47:38] did you hear me she will never be asked
[1:47:41] she is not a child
[1:47:42] ishmael never was a child of faith it
[1:47:45] was she
[1:47:46] he was a child of abraham's self efforts
[1:47:49] and works
[1:47:51] remember when isaac come on the scene he
[1:47:54] was a miracle child
[1:47:56] abraham's body was now dead
[1:47:59] and sarah's womb was dead
[1:48:03] and god had to do a new creation
[1:48:07] and every true child of god will be
[1:48:10] a new creation they will not be
[1:48:13] the works of human expression of
[1:48:16] the laws of do's and don'ts and this and
[1:48:20] that and conforming
[1:48:21] to a message society or to a message
[1:48:25] of god this is not a law this is the
[1:48:28] grace of god
[1:48:29] poured out where he is bringing forth a
[1:48:32] new creation where he makes anew
[1:48:36] and creates a child of creation
[1:48:41] not a child of works and human efforts
[1:48:47] when you get people you gotta beg and
[1:48:50] pamper and baby to come to church
[1:48:52] amen you might get them to come but
[1:48:54] they're children of your efforts
[1:49:01] now again
[1:49:06] again that's why i don't go chase after
[1:49:08] you
[1:49:10] you either want to come or you don't
[1:49:12] want to come
[1:49:15] amen you know there was a lot let me
[1:49:18] just stop and talk about him for a
[1:49:20] minute
[1:49:21] god called abraham but abraham called
[1:49:23] lot
[1:49:25] and he wasn't nothing but what brother
[1:49:27] branham described but as a hair in the
[1:49:29] biscuit
[1:49:32] until he separated himself you say
[1:49:35] brother tim you're just one you just
[1:49:37] want us to leave right you just want us
[1:49:39] to separate i want you to separate from
[1:49:41] sin
[1:49:42] and the world and the darkness of this
[1:49:45] world and come to christ
[1:49:47] amen get born again and become abraham's
[1:49:49] seed
[1:49:50] and not a lot amen you do not have to
[1:49:54] identify yourself
[1:49:56] with lot you don't have to identify
[1:49:59] yourself with an ich bill
[1:50:04] you make your own choice there
[1:50:16] but the bonds woman brought forth a
[1:50:18] child
[1:50:19] who is a wild man bible said in genesis
[1:50:22] 16 12
[1:50:23] he will be a wild man his hand will be
[1:50:26] against
[1:50:27] every man and every man's hand against
[1:50:30] him
[1:50:32] well you know that's true today look
[1:50:34] what's going over there
[1:50:35] in in israel now with the palestinians
[1:50:38] trying to claim the same land so we're
[1:50:40] seed of abraham too
[1:50:43] but you see this is also why the great
[1:50:45] battles between the denominations
[1:50:48] and their scholars and their differences
[1:50:50] that separates them from others
[1:50:52] and that same thing that's happened
[1:50:54] around the message
[1:50:55] these ishmael movements
[1:50:58] amen they're wild as a donkey that won't
[1:51:01] be
[1:51:01] they want i'm just quoting scripture
[1:51:03] they won't be subject
[1:51:05] to to the word of god their hand is
[1:51:07] against everybody
[1:51:10] amen you they can't fellowship with
[1:51:12] nobody
[1:51:13] you know they you know you you ain't in
[1:51:16] my true lord camp or you ain't in my
[1:51:18] perugia camp or you ain't my thunder
[1:51:20] camper
[1:51:20] you ain't in this camp or you ain't that
[1:51:22] come on
[1:51:24] all of them are just ishmael moves
[1:51:27] that that is where they're just fighting
[1:51:30] and turmoil and
[1:51:31] you know you're fighting over the
[1:51:33] message come on the message wasn't the
[1:51:35] fight over
[1:51:36] the message was for you to live out of
[1:51:38] your life
[1:51:39] [Applause]
[1:51:40] [Music]
[1:51:46] in fact all of these great battles
[1:51:50] through the years in christianity permit
[1:51:52] for
[1:51:52] tradition for uh producing all of these
[1:51:55] ishmaelite moves
[1:51:57] results in splitting up the body of
[1:52:00] christ
[1:52:01] in the 40 000 different denominations
[1:52:03] today
[1:52:05] everyone the gateway to heaven
[1:52:10] everyone the way the truth and the life
[1:52:18] and i'll tell you what try to weed your
[1:52:21] way through the merit of all of them to
[1:52:22] try and
[1:52:23] try to find truth
[1:52:28] because ain't none of them got any truth
[1:52:32] they're all based on men's ideas
[1:52:35] so well what about you and following
[1:52:37] this message i'll tell you
[1:52:39] ours was not william branham's thoughts
[1:52:44] [Music]
[1:52:45] it came by an angel the angel of the
[1:52:49] covenant the one who
[1:52:50] made the covenant came down to vindicate
[1:52:53] his own word
[1:52:54] in this day to bring you a message
[1:52:59] that you are chosen the chosen
[1:53:01] generation
[1:53:02] to bring forth the promised son
[1:53:05] hallelujah
[1:53:07] [Applause]
[1:53:09] now don't get me wrong sarah had faith
[1:53:11] her faith was that
[1:53:12] abraham could do it but not her it's you
[1:53:15] know
[1:53:15] agar could do it but not her you know
[1:53:19] you see the church has long given up on
[1:53:22] the promise
[1:53:24] that the promise is to be fulfilled
[1:53:25] through her she she believes in jesus
[1:53:28] she believes in his power that he can do
[1:53:31] anything
[1:53:33] but not through her
[1:53:36] some message believers have sunk down
[1:53:38] into this same kind of
[1:53:40] unbelief they instead have substituted
[1:53:43] brother branham for jesus
[1:53:45] and their faith is a historical faith
[1:53:49] to them it all lays in the prophet
[1:53:53] brother branham tried to keep people
[1:53:55] from putting their faith in him
[1:53:57] as no true servant of christ we will
[1:54:00] point to himself but to jesus and that's
[1:54:03] why we see it falling away is because it
[1:54:05] made brother branham infallible
[1:54:08] that made him god and now they see his
[1:54:10] humanity they lose their faith
[1:54:15] amen now as we as we
[1:54:18] look at this you know i mean come on
[1:54:22] there's a lot of things that that are
[1:54:24] listed here in different direction we
[1:54:26] could go
[1:54:27] but as we see this scene open must have
[1:54:31] been a very hot day abraham's sitting in
[1:54:33] the tent of the door
[1:54:34] he getting out where he can get a little
[1:54:36] breeze sitting in the shade
[1:54:39] maybe there had been a lot of complaints
[1:54:41] of the herdsmen
[1:54:42] that the grass was all gone the economy
[1:54:45] was dying
[1:54:48] at 401k is gonna crumble
[1:54:51] it'll vanish in the night and it could
[1:54:54] very well
[1:54:56] well i'll cash out the dollars
[1:54:59] that's all i say what's your money gonna
[1:55:02] be worth
[1:55:06] amen well you know you think of a way to
[1:55:10] save yourself
[1:55:13] i'm going to remind you there's only one
[1:55:15] way of salvation and that's through
[1:55:18] the angel
[1:55:22] all your self preservation will not work
[1:55:28] well we'll store up food for hard times
[1:55:31] yeah and your beans have turned hard and
[1:55:32] go rank
[1:55:37] you know somebody wrote me the other day
[1:55:38] and said you know there's some
[1:55:40] some rich friends there i forgot how
[1:55:43] much so i'll make up something bought
[1:55:45] fifty thousand dollars with the beans
[1:55:47] and i said
[1:55:48] uh well by the time you eat all these
[1:55:52] beans
[1:55:54] they will all turn rank weevils
[1:55:58] they won't last you'll be throwing them
[1:56:00] out
[1:56:02] don't prepare to stay here
[1:56:07] let me just tell you you're not even fit
[1:56:09] to live here
[1:56:10] until you're ready to go from here
[1:56:22] and if you're not ready to go you're not
[1:56:24] even fit to stay
[1:56:32] and i tell you what if we're waiting on
[1:56:34] you you do me a big favor to get in
[1:56:39] i've been waiting on you a long time
[1:56:44] but anyway maybe they'd found the water
[1:56:47] holes in the land the water got low and
[1:56:49] they go dig out and find where water was
[1:56:51] seeping
[1:56:52] and the water and the cattle just didn't
[1:56:53] have enough to supply them
[1:56:57] you know sometimes things get difficult
[1:57:00] in the promised land
[1:57:03] that makes you want to leave the
[1:57:05] promised land
[1:57:08] it happened to abraham he went down to
[1:57:10] egypt
[1:57:11] and he learned a big lesson down there
[1:57:14] come on
[1:57:16] and and and so there again
[1:57:19] you know trouble was on every hand
[1:57:21] because he he went down to egypt i think
[1:57:23] this is one reason
[1:57:24] he didn't turn go down the sodom he'd
[1:57:26] already been down to egypt
[1:57:30] and he didn't find anything of comfort
[1:57:32] down there
[1:57:34] but you know things go wrong we we know
[1:57:37] by nature that
[1:57:38] that it's the darkness just before the
[1:57:40] day and
[1:57:41] and quoting brother branham here he said
[1:57:43] many times we see
[1:57:44] disastrous things happening especially
[1:57:47] to believers
[1:57:48] we must bear this in our mind that is
[1:57:50] satan trying to block
[1:57:53] the blessing that is on this road
[1:57:58] amen so you ought to look at all of this
[1:58:00] all of this
[1:58:02] uh this this adversity that we're facing
[1:58:05] and saying
[1:58:06] look here satan i don't got a clue on
[1:58:09] you
[1:58:10] you're only trying to block a blessing
[1:58:13] that is on its way
[1:58:16] hallelujah because one of the greatest
[1:58:19] blessings of sarah's life
[1:58:20] would happen in the next few minutes
[1:58:25] in the darkest hour in the worst time
[1:58:28] in the the time where it looked the
[1:58:30] least possibilities
[1:58:43] and he said satan was trying to tempt
[1:58:46] him
[1:58:47] to feel they had done wrong
[1:58:52] satan trying to tempt them to think
[1:58:55] they had done wrong
[1:58:58] and was trying to block off the oncoming
[1:59:01] visitation that god was going to give
[1:59:03] abraham and sarah
[1:59:06] our church ain't nothing out of order
[1:59:12] amen nothing's out of cater
[1:59:16] everything that you're seeing going
[1:59:17] around you say well this cobia this
[1:59:20] and then the worst diseases and the more
[1:59:22] contagious one's coming and
[1:59:24] you know and and and things that are
[1:59:26] fixing to happen in our government
[1:59:28] and troubles don't every hand by the tim
[1:59:30] you know
[1:59:31] he what did we do wrong we didn't do
[1:59:34] nothing wrong
[1:59:36] amen god's god has given us a promise
[1:59:40] and and no matter how bad it seems i
[1:59:43] want you to remember
[1:59:44] it's just working for your good
[1:59:47] i i know maybe you're disappointed maybe
[1:59:50] you're the man you thought
[1:59:51] who would give us a couple of more years
[1:59:53] or whatever else
[1:59:55] but tranquility and peace and better
[1:59:57] things in
[1:59:58] america first and all of this you know
[2:00:01] he didn't get elected
[2:00:03] amen if he did they didn't recognize the
[2:00:06] election
[2:00:08] whatever happened they stole it
[2:00:16] you can't convince a true american
[2:00:18] otherwise
[2:00:22] it is a repeating of history
[2:00:27] and i'll bring it down in a minute
[2:00:30] but anyway he says satan's been after me
[2:00:33] all day so i believe there's a blessing
[2:00:35] in store here in this city somewhere and
[2:00:38] i know when he chimps and tries to block
[2:00:40] out what he's trying to do
[2:00:42] get you to disbelieve and the worst
[2:00:44] thing that you can do is
[2:00:46] disbelieve god and as soon as you get a
[2:00:49] little scared
[2:00:50] well maybe i haven't done this and i
[2:00:52] haven't done that
[2:00:54] right then satan's got the blessing
[2:00:56] conquered for you
[2:00:57] you can't get to it as long as satan
[2:00:59] makes you think that
[2:01:00] and i'll tell you if you do have things
[2:01:03] in your life
[2:01:04] that you're wondering about repent
[2:01:08] get it under the blood like the woman we
[2:01:10] spoke about
[2:01:11] last sunday you know where she was the
[2:01:14] last
[2:01:14] wheelchair the last one in a wheelchair
[2:01:19] hallelujah and the angel of god the
[2:01:22] pillar of fire
[2:01:23] would come down on her but be driven
[2:01:25] away by her thinking

[2:01:30] i've been in this condition too long my
[2:01:32] case is too hard
[2:01:34] my case is worse than others

[2:01:41] something else i
[2:01:42] i'm just not worthy i i'm just not good
[2:01:45] enough
[2:01:47] the only way you can be good enough is
[2:01:50] come by the way of the blood
[2:01:53] you think you're going to live in this
[2:01:54] flesh and perfection
[2:01:56] this flesh isn't perfect it takes a
[2:02:00] repentance and
[2:02:01] continually walk into the spirit and
[2:02:04] keeping your body subject
[2:02:06] to the word of god bringing your flesh

[2:02:42] visitation coming
[2:02:44] amen and when we know things are rising
[2:02:47] things are wrong
[2:02:48] and troubles on every hand if we would

[2:02:54] sarah was missing it
[2:02:56] you know she was kind of fussy you know
[2:02:59] why is it that we got to be
[2:03:01] so different how come we got to be the
[2:03:03] oddballs around
[2:03:05] you know the messy people did not use
[2:03:07] the oddballs or the eyeball of the
[2:03:09] eyeballs of the oddballs
[2:03:16] why you know the other day i went to the
[2:03:19] city and miss lots she had on one of the
[2:03:21] cutest little dresses and her her hairdo
[2:03:24] was
[2:03:25] this way and that and it was styled by
[2:03:28] the egyptians yeah
[2:03:30] so you got the new styles and you know
[2:03:32] they learn to
[2:03:33] twinkle your eyes and you know make them
[2:03:36] larger and bigger and
[2:03:38] you know and and you know where we could
[2:03:41] kind of wink and
[2:03:42] seduce men
[2:03:46] and then you know they they got all the
[2:03:48] new styles well why can't we just be a
[2:03:51] baptist
[2:03:51] come on come on what's all this stuff
[2:03:54] about angels and prophets and
[2:03:57] you know messengers and
[2:04:01] you know what why can't we just be like
[2:04:02] the rest of them
[2:04:05] and it's as simple as this
[2:04:08] there's an abraham group and there's
[2:04:11] lots
[2:04:16] and they went through different
[2:04:17] directions both of them were going to
[2:04:20] the same land
[2:04:21] but one got sidetracked you saw the
[2:04:24] glamour and the glitter
[2:04:26] and the gold and the big lights and oh
[2:04:29] the worldly placers
[2:04:31] you know where you could kind of live a
[2:04:33] highway life and be accepted
[2:04:36] even looked on his righteous among them
[2:04:40] because they were so evil
[2:04:42] [Music]
[2:04:44] you know and and but it's you know sarah
[2:04:48] now she's all out of out of tune with
[2:04:50] what god's doing and i
[2:04:52] i just say you know god's doing some
[2:04:54] wonderful things right now
[2:04:56] in this end time process don't get
[2:04:59] distracted
[2:05:01] don't get pulled another direction amen
[2:05:05] you know if sarah had only known there
[2:05:08] was more than a caravan from egypt
[2:05:10] coming by
[2:05:12] hallelujah there was a host of the lord
[2:05:14] headed her way
[2:05:15] [Applause]
[2:05:18] hallelujah and i want you to know it's
[2:05:20] more than a new president
[2:05:22] or vice president for us it's more than
[2:05:24] our new society
[2:05:26] and the ideas of man it's more than that
[2:05:29] there's a host of angels on their way
[2:05:34] hallelujah and abraham looked up and he
[2:05:37] said
[2:05:37] oh honey sarah today is our day of
[2:05:41] visitation
[2:05:42] right now and i believe that's what the
[2:05:45] holy spirit is trying to tell
[2:05:47] evening like tabernacle today is your
[2:05:50] day
[2:05:50] of visitation right now this time
[2:05:54] this hour this place
[2:05:59] we are getting our visitation and every
[2:06:02] time he comes something good happens
[2:06:07] hallelujah
[2:06:11] this may be the day you get up and push
[2:06:14] your wheelchair around
[2:06:15] of your complexes and the things that
[2:06:18] sins that are so easily beset you
[2:06:20] instead of them pushing you around you
[2:06:22] push them around
[2:06:25] hallelujah this is the day where that
[2:06:27] all
[2:06:28] that you're a reality comes even that
[2:06:31] god hasn't forgotten his people
[2:06:34] that he's never too late though you may
[2:06:36] be 90 years old sarah
[2:06:38] god is never too late he's always on
[2:06:40] time
[2:06:41] he's right there at the right moment at
[2:06:44] the right time
[2:06:45] to speak through your life
[2:06:46] [Applause]
[2:06:52] amen oh but the preaching of the gospel
[2:06:57] can blind the unbeliever
[2:07:00] god says they have eyes they can see in
[2:07:02] ears and they can't hear
[2:07:05] but god if anything i wanted him to do
[2:07:07] for me
[2:07:08] is open my spiritual eyes didn't i say
[2:07:12] there was to be a bride with us
[2:07:13] that's a spiritual class of people
[2:07:16] supernatural
[2:07:17] who have eyes and ears to see and hear
[2:07:22] i want to see him get so acquainted with
[2:07:25] him
[2:07:26] that i know him on the very first sight
[2:07:28] i'll recognize it's god
[2:07:31] amen you know be like abraham was isn't
[2:07:33] that your desire
[2:07:35] i can recognize him you know his first
[2:07:38] moves now i don't want to miss him
[2:07:42] [Music]
[2:07:45] amen come on because when these angels
[2:07:47] come down to sodom
[2:07:49] they miss him they only saw men
[2:07:53] they didn't see angels
[2:07:56] they missed him and i'll tell you you
[2:08:00] can be
[2:08:00] right in the same spot amen that's why
[2:08:04] one will be taken another left one will
[2:08:06] be taken and another left
[2:08:09] it'll even happen it'll happen in the
[2:08:11] service sometimes one will be taken
[2:08:13] crapped up into the spirit another right
[2:08:16] beside them
[2:08:17] left behind i'll tell you i don't want
[2:08:19] to be left behind at any church service
[2:08:21] and i shouldn't be left behind in the
[2:08:23] rapture
[2:08:24] [Music]
[2:08:24] [Applause]
[2:08:27] but a true eagle will gather where the
[2:08:29] body is
[2:08:35] now
[2:08:38] another character in this prophecy we've
[2:08:41] already touched on his lot
[2:08:45] the nominal church who just followed
[2:08:49] abraham but he never had a true
[2:08:52] revelation
[2:08:55] he eventually set his tents towards
[2:08:57] sodom
[2:08:58] that's where worldly church i guarantee
[2:09:02] you the
[2:09:03] the the early fathers of the methodists
[2:09:05] who started down their land
[2:09:07] as they began to get cold and you know
[2:09:11] the methodist move used to be a revival
[2:09:15] my john wesley would preach and they
[2:09:17] would fall out in the spirit until they
[2:09:20] would take water and wash them in the
[2:09:22] face and wake him up
[2:09:25] have to revive them they're so lost in
[2:09:27] the spirit
[2:09:30] and you know then it became it as
[2:09:33] the move went on a little more starchy
[2:09:36] and
[2:09:36] you know we don't want those times
[2:09:38] anymore
[2:09:40] you know somebody running the aisles and
[2:09:42] shouting and
[2:09:43] whatever we we don't want them kind of
[2:09:46] service
[2:09:46] you know that that ain't dignified and
[2:09:49] they begin to
[2:09:50] get an educational program and
[2:09:53] and they want it moved away from those
[2:09:56] holy ghost meetings
[2:09:58] you know they started down towards sodom
[2:10:00] but they didn't intend to go there
[2:10:04] you know a lot didn't probably intend
[2:10:07] to go all the way it was going to get
[2:10:09] close where it was convenient
[2:10:12] you know uh he was just he just
[2:10:16] making some moves you know uh they kind
[2:10:19] of getting a little
[2:10:20] uh in his choice he didn't know it but
[2:10:23] it was moving him
[2:10:24] away and his eyes had been caught the
[2:10:28] glamour of sodom and he couldn't
[2:10:31] see the burning that was going to come
[2:10:34] he couldn't see members of his family
[2:10:37] perishing in the flames
[2:10:41] he couldn't see his wife turn into a
[2:10:44] pillar of salt because she
[2:10:45] loved sodom better than she did to obey
[2:10:47] this angel's voice
[2:10:56] you know lot is a nominal church
[2:11:01] like i said methodists they never
[2:11:04] dreamed
[2:11:04] when they started this when they started
[2:11:07] edging down
[2:11:08] towards sodom and this past they never
[2:11:10] dreamed their leaders would be
[2:11:12] homosexuals
[2:11:18] they never dreamed the immorality that
[2:11:22] would come in the church they never
[2:11:23] could see
[2:11:24] they couldn't see women in their pulpits
[2:11:28] because of the perversion that was
[2:11:30] happening in the church
[2:11:34] are you with me amen you know they
[2:11:37] couldn't see
[2:11:38] and and that's the way it is a lot of
[2:11:39] times you know
[2:11:41] choices that you make and young people
[2:11:44] you're one of the you're the one that's
[2:11:47] some of the most
[2:11:48] vulnerable there is because you are
[2:11:50] making choices
[2:11:51] it's a time where choices are made that
[2:11:54] sets your life a certain direction
[2:11:57] your choice of mate your choice of
[2:11:59] education your choice
[2:12:03] of friends
[2:12:11] you know this this cool kid
[2:12:15] we've had some of the cool kids
[2:12:20] hey man some of the cute cool kids i
[2:12:22] listened to brother andrew
[2:12:24] you know singing a while ago he followed
[2:12:26] a cool kid
[2:12:33] until one day
[2:12:37] god opened his eyes
[2:12:42] amen what did he do he picked him up and
[2:12:44] he turned him around
[2:12:46] and he put his feet on solid ground
[2:12:49] [Applause]
[2:12:50] hallelujah and there's no going back no
[2:12:53] more
[2:12:55] no going back no more you say well
[2:12:56] brother tim what about the cool kids
[2:12:58] you're talking about
[2:12:59] i pray for every one of them prodigals
[2:13:01] that god will get a hold of them
[2:13:04] wherever they are eating the slop of the
[2:13:07] world
[2:13:07] amen the angel of god that we're talking
[2:13:10] about
[2:13:10] visiting us the angel of god will go by
[2:13:13] their way
[2:13:14] and wake them up in this late hour
[2:13:16] [Applause]
[2:13:22] not ought to be the cry of every parent
[2:13:28] the lot never had a true revelation
[2:13:31] himself
[2:13:34] the worldly church set their tent
[2:13:36] towards sodom
[2:13:38] but even lot in his backslidden
[2:13:40] condition when those
[2:13:41] two angels there's messengers those
[2:13:43] evangelists
[2:13:45] the lord was sitting in the gate and and
[2:13:48] a little spark was still
[2:13:50] it was still left in his heart and he he
[2:13:52] recognized
[2:13:54] that was that it was angels
[2:13:57] it was messengers from god and and
[2:14:00] he wanted to hear what those angels had
[2:14:02] to say
[2:14:03] he invited him to his house
[2:14:10] do you know even the nominal church
[2:14:14] they are desirous of some of the
[2:14:16] anointing
[2:14:21] amen i'll get to that more in a minute
[2:14:26] there's another thing it's a city it's a
[2:14:29] people their character
[2:14:31] in this whole thing is sodom it
[2:14:34] exemplifies the world condition
[2:14:37] and our churches have given over to
[2:14:38] sodom
[2:14:40] women homosexuals in the pulpit lesbians
[2:14:43] women wearing men's apparel
[2:14:47] men wearing women's apparel
[2:14:50] hey man women cutting their hair and men
[2:14:53] growing theirs long
[2:14:56] amen when the great apostle paul who
[2:14:59] preached the gospel of jesus christ
[2:15:02] has revealed him said it's a shame
[2:15:05] for a man to wear long hair
[2:15:08] and and share a short hair on a woman is
[2:15:12] dishonorable
[2:15:14] amen by bible standards that's true
[2:15:18] amount that's not something brother
[2:15:20] branham made up that's something the
[2:15:22] bible teaches
[2:15:24] amen our schools and our colleges are
[2:15:27] now teaching
[2:15:28] sodom curriculum
[2:15:33] you know it was one of the first things
[2:15:35] that mr biden did was roll back mr
[2:15:37] trump's executive order
[2:15:39] of teaching history in in school
[2:15:43] that told about god and the pilgrim
[2:15:45] fathers and the founding fathers and
[2:15:47] what our nation was founded on he rolled
[2:15:49] it back right there
[2:15:50] to do away with that anything about god
[2:15:53] in our curriculum to put it down cram it
[2:15:57] down our kids
[2:16:00] of a religion of a nation that is
[2:16:03] has freedom from god
[2:16:10] our schools were teaching a sodom
[2:16:12] curriculum
[2:16:14] you better have the holy ghost before
[2:16:16] you go there
[2:16:20] you know no matter you know teaching the
[2:16:23] youth that no matter what
[2:16:24] god created you to be i'm just talking
[2:16:26] about the sodom condition they're a
[2:16:28] player in this
[2:16:30] so bear with me just a moment amen but
[2:16:33] you know i
[2:16:34] i are they're teaching to you that no
[2:16:36] matter what god created you to be
[2:16:39] male or female and that's what he did he
[2:16:40] created a male
[2:16:42] or thin female is that right
[2:16:46] you don't get to choose it god does
[2:16:50] amen you can do but they're teaching you
[2:16:53] can choose whatever
[2:16:54] sex you want to be and our government
[2:16:57] has given over to sodom
[2:17:00] and sodomy you know headlines are
[2:17:02] screaming that
[2:17:04] biden is reshaping gender and
[2:17:06] reproductive rights
[2:17:09] you know their their transgenders can
[2:17:11] now play as girls on girls sports teams
[2:17:14] and
[2:17:14] all this being advocated transgenders
[2:17:20] you know there is fire and destruction
[2:17:24] that's another thing that's in the scene
[2:17:29] fire and destruction representing the
[2:17:31] atomic age
[2:17:34] and the destruction of the world by fire
[2:17:38] and i want you to know we're right now
[2:17:40] here at that place
[2:17:45] i forget what year it was but it's out
[2:17:47] in the national geographic right now
[2:17:50] brother doug bacon told us a special
[2:17:52] testimony he was one year old his father
[2:17:55] was at that base in north uh was it
[2:17:58] north carolina i think
[2:18:00] anyway it was there a little sleepy base
[2:18:02] but they had become
[2:18:04] uh one of the places where the b-52s
[2:18:07] were
[2:18:07] flying into and there on a certain day
[2:18:12] i get all the dates and all of that but
[2:18:14] that's not important for this sermon
[2:18:16] on a certain day back there in the in
[2:18:19] the early
[2:18:20] 60s i think it was 61
[2:18:23] and the seals had not been opened i want
[2:18:25] you to know that's key
[2:18:28] and and the seals had not been opened
[2:18:31] the book had not been revealed and
[2:18:33] and these loaded bombs two atomic bombs
[2:18:38] they would this b-52 would disintegrate
[2:18:43] in the sky there would be men
[2:18:46] that would actually um eject from there
[2:18:50] and some of them were found dead hanging
[2:18:52] in the trees others never
[2:18:54] never could their ejector didn't work
[2:18:56] one one black man
[2:18:58] he was um an air force man
[2:19:01] that was on that mission and he was not
[2:19:04] in a jump seat and
[2:19:05] and when they ejected out of that hole
[2:19:08] he he ejected out and pulled his string
[2:19:12] and and and there you know his
[2:19:15] his his um parachute opened
[2:19:20] and and he was drifting slowly down and
[2:19:23] all of a sudden it explodes
[2:19:25] on the ground and a great great thing
[2:19:28] happening
[2:19:29] and it brings his um his his um
[2:19:33] parachute together and and he's
[2:19:36] falling now and he said well i'm a child
[2:19:39] of god he was a christian man i'm a
[2:19:41] child of god and
[2:19:42] if this is what god wills and about that
[2:19:45] time
[2:19:45] another blast goes open and a blast of
[2:19:47] air comes back opens his chute
[2:19:50] and he's heading down right now toward
[2:19:52] the wreckage to land in the fire
[2:19:54] and he said well if this would be the
[2:19:56] will of my god and let it be the will of
[2:19:59] my god
[2:20:00] and a wind blew him about a mile or so
[2:20:04] from the wreckage
[2:20:10] this ain't funny but because he was a
[2:20:13] black man and he shows up at the base
[2:20:14] with a parachute
[2:20:17] and it gives us this fantastic story
[2:20:20] they arrest him for stealing a parachute
[2:20:25] par for the courts huh you think brother
[2:20:28] l
[2:20:28] par for the course so you know
[2:20:33] anyway two atomic bombs
[2:20:37] that is large enough to destroy every
[2:20:40] city
[2:20:41] in the east coast
[2:20:44] and they're designed at that moment the
[2:20:47] moment they see
[2:20:47] radiation come up and signal on that for
[2:20:50] them to drop the bombs
[2:20:52] those planes that are close to russia
[2:20:56] and in one moment's time the world was
[2:20:59] that close to going up
[2:21:03] into atomic fodder but the angels
[2:21:08] that holds the four winds of the earth
[2:21:11] say wait a minute amen
[2:21:14] the seals aren't open i got a call of
[2:21:18] bride
[2:21:19] amen the gospel got to turn to the jews
[2:21:22] and god held off that nuclear
[2:21:24] destruction that was coming on the earth
[2:21:26] but that's how close we've already came
[2:21:29] to it and it would
[2:21:30] already happen except god held it back
[2:21:36] they said there are seven triggers on
[2:21:38] those atomic bombs
[2:21:40] and it got down to the last one
[2:21:44] and it didn't detonate
[2:21:47] it went down with such velocity they
[2:21:50] went down 175
[2:21:52] feet into the earth
[2:21:58] but let me tell you there's fire and
[2:22:01] destruction
[2:22:03] representing the atomic age and the
[2:22:05] destruction of the world
[2:22:07] by fire and we are in the sixth vision
[2:22:13] do i need to remind you mussolini would
[2:22:16] invade ethiopia and the nation
[2:22:18] followed his steps the rise and the fall
[2:22:22] then of adolf hitler was shown
[2:22:24] the isms of nazism and fascism would be
[2:22:28] swallowed up by communism and the voice
[2:22:29] admonishment
[2:22:31] watch russia watch russia keep your eye
[2:22:33] on the king of the north
[2:22:35] the fourth vision advances in science
[2:22:38] that was headed up by a vision
[2:22:39] of an egg-shaped car
[2:22:43] the word aerial dynamic was not invented
[2:22:48] yet
[2:22:51] it would be guided by somehow without a
[2:22:54] steering wheel
[2:22:56] showing advances in science where are we
[2:22:58] on that
[2:23:01] we're already hearing them in our
[2:23:04] driving on our
[2:23:05] our our highways
[2:23:08] come on we're already hearing of laws
[2:23:12] being passed that permits them to be
[2:23:14] there
[2:23:15] we're hearing of remote trains and
[2:23:17] promote this and that or wow whatever
[2:23:19] way that they do it
[2:23:21] remote may not be the right word but
[2:23:22] anyway whether they are
[2:23:24] whatever way that they do it remote may
[2:23:27] not be the right word but anyway
[2:23:29] we're that they are self-guided
[2:23:33] and then it showed them the fifth was
[2:23:35] the moral problem of our age
[2:23:37] centered mostly around women and i'm
[2:23:39] going to tell you women
[2:23:40] don't be a part of this vision
[2:23:46] you make it up in your mind and heart
[2:23:49] i'm not going to fulfill that vision
[2:23:51] because there is another vision not of
[2:23:54] an immoral woman
[2:23:56] [Applause]
[2:23:57] but of a woman of bride who is walking
[2:24:00] instead with the word of god
[2:24:03] and when the others go down she goes up
[2:24:12] and brother branham said then you can
[2:24:14] like it or lump it
[2:24:16] you can say it's out of date and out of
[2:24:19] step
[2:24:19] and it is
[2:24:23] because we're not going their direction
[2:24:29] it is out this what i'm fixing to tell
[2:24:31] you is out of date
[2:24:32] it is out of step with what the rest of
[2:24:36] the world and the way society thinks but
[2:24:38] it's the word of god
[2:24:39] anyhow it doesn't change the word
[2:24:45] and he showed me women began to be out
[2:24:47] of their place by with the granting of
[2:24:48] the vote
[2:24:50] and they cut off their hair which
[2:24:52] signified they were no longer under the
[2:24:54] authority of man
[2:24:56] but signified instead of but insisted on
[2:25:00] either equal rights or in most cases um
[2:25:04] more than equal rights let me stop right
[2:25:06] there
[2:25:07] paul also taught that the man is the
[2:25:10] head
[2:25:10] of the woman and the man's head is
[2:25:14] christ there's a family structure
[2:25:18] that message people must not forget
[2:25:20] [Music]
[2:25:22] amen god made men to be a leader man
[2:25:26] step up
[2:25:30] amen be real men be real fathers
[2:25:35] exemplify the father of heaven in your
[2:25:38] relationship with your children
[2:25:40] be a husband to your wife be true be
[2:25:43] honest
[2:25:44] be right
[2:25:48] that's what makes helps make happy homes
[2:25:51] it's only one half
[2:25:54] the other half of it is she
[2:25:57] it comes to the woman's side but anyway
[2:25:59] in this
[2:26:00] she adopted men's clothing and went to a
[2:26:02] state of undress
[2:26:04] until the last picture i saw was a woman
[2:26:06] naked except for a little fig leaf type
[2:26:08] apron
[2:26:09] with this vision i saw the terrible
[2:26:10] perversion and moral plight in the world
[2:26:13] and i want to just say to you
[2:26:14] we are in the sixth vision
[2:26:18] and that sixth vision now we've seen
[2:26:20] them all they're
[2:26:21] you know the car is on the scene the
[2:26:24] women's situation is on the scene
[2:26:30] i know i know we don't like it women
[2:26:32] given the right to vote women should
[2:26:33] have
[2:26:34] the right to vote listen if they were
[2:26:35] all holy ghost field we wouldn't have a
[2:26:37] problem
[2:26:41] amen but when they are led when they're
[2:26:44] led by society and
[2:26:46] ideas and emotions hormones
[2:26:52] and the desire to to to conquer
[2:26:56] and be more than equal oh i know you're
[2:26:59] on the tangent brother tim you're way
[2:27:01] out there

[2:27:28] different ambition

[2:28:25] a great woman will rise up and be
[2:28:27] president or something like that in the
[2:28:28] nation

[2:40:40] [Music]
[2:40:46] now sarah
[2:40:52] the next thing you know there's a
[2:40:55] character in there
[2:40:59] and he's got to be in there it's kind of
[2:41:02] a strange story why would this even be
[2:41:05] in there
[2:41:07] abimelech
[2:41:10] why go down to gurir 40 miles after the
[2:41:13] visitation of the angel
[2:41:16] and go down and have this whole deal
[2:41:19] with
[2:41:19] abimelech you know why why is this such
[2:41:24] an
[2:41:24] important part to go in the bible when
[2:41:26] every part of the bible is important
[2:41:29] so why is this important why is it
[2:41:32] important that
[2:41:34] this young king
[2:41:39] gets google-eyed
[2:41:48] over a 90 year old woman
[2:42:01] come on boys
[2:42:05] let me find me a 90 year old woman bring
[2:42:08] up here and see if you google eye
[2:42:12] you'd run baby run
[2:42:17] that's the way it was sarah hunchback
[2:42:22] old wrinkled
[2:42:39] come on and all of a sudden
[2:42:45] she's the cat of the walk
[2:42:49] a young king looks out
[2:43:02] is she married no no that's my sister
[2:43:10] my lucky day
[2:43:14] that's just just what i needed a
[2:43:16] beautiful young brother
[2:43:18] i just maybe he had already 40 in the
[2:43:21] hiram but
[2:43:22] this one was better than all of them
[2:43:26] so i'll just add her to my collection
[2:43:33] but god comes with a in the middle of
[2:43:35] the night in a dream now now i'm going
[2:43:37] to tell you some things
[2:43:39] i personally look at hagar who gets two
[2:43:42] visitations by an angel
[2:43:44] she's a slave girl a bonds woman
[2:43:48] she is the mother of a wild race
[2:43:51] she is an egyptian but she gets an angel
[2:43:55] visitation twice
[2:43:57] then i look over here and i see
[2:43:59] abimelech
[2:44:00] and he has the spiritual dream and in
[2:44:03] this dream
[2:44:04] god speaks to him and says i know the
[2:44:06] integrity of your heart you wouldn't
[2:44:08] have taken taken this woman
