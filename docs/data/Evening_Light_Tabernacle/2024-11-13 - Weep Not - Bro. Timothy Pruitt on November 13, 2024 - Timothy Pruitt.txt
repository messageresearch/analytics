Commit This service to you for your glory in Jesus name amen amen let's turn to Revelations chapter 5 amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen looking forward to the weekend coming up Saturday having the Fall Festival and time of Fellowship together believe believe it'll be a wonderful time for the being PR to be in as well and his family so looking forward to fellowshipping with them as well amen Revelations 5 and verse one and said I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a normal angel or a weak angel no a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and the loose the seals thereof it didn't even say I saw an angel he said I saw a strong Angel and no man in Heaven Nor on Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on and one of the elders said to me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him the S of the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vows full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and H has been redeemed and has redeemed us to God by their blood out of every Kindred tongue people and nation and it made unto us un made made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth and I beheld and heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them 10 was 10 times 10 thousands times 10 thousands and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice Worthy is a lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing to every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the Earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard I say in blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sth upon this throne and the lamb forever and ever and the four beasts said a man and the four and 20 Elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever amen we'll let you be seated been on thinking about this thought for some time and I I don't know hopefully can bring it out i' like to speak to you on weep not weep not as I as I read there as we kind of made a point of a strong Angel it was a strong angel that was crying with a loud voice proclaiming who is worthy worthy for what who's worthy to take the book and and I got to looking at this word strong it's one of great strength a warrior or one of great Authority a master and mighty and strong and I was reading in Psalms chapter 103 and verse 20 it says bless the Lord ye his angels that excel in strength amen so these angels excel in strength they Excel they excel at being Warriors they excel at being masters of every circumstance and we can also see the same word used for the mighty angel that came down from heaven Revelations 10 it's a forcible or boisterous mightier powerful stronger Valiant so in other words we're not in the hands of someone who is incapable of handling any situation that we're in he is in control and he's always been in control and he always will be in control amen you know we can read through the scriptures of of the of the of how that the Bible would try to Define this mighty one it says in zephani 3 and verse1 17 it says the Lord your God he is the one that's in your midst and he is a mighty one who will save who will save he will rejoice over you with gladness he will qu You by his love but he is a mighty one that will save amen Deuteronomy 10 verse1 17 says for the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords the great the Mighty the awesome God who's not partial and takes no bribes hey amen Psalms 145 says great is the Lord and he's greatly to be praised and his greatness is unsearchable amen Hebrews 1 would say he is the radiance of the glory of the God and he ex he's the exact imprint of his nature and he upholds the universe by the word of his power so just by the word his word has power and it's upholding the universe today as we think about just that thought along as we think about all that's going on in our world and and and not not even the political world but just the world itself and how how how the how the world is sitting here in this great Universe and Everything perfect time and Perfect Harmony it is held there by the word of his power and it's a sign for us to look at every day of our life that if God's word holds that world God's word holds your world Amen that is nothing out of cader there's nothing out of out of whack but it's all working according to his plan amen for he is a great God and he's in control amen Psalms 147 says great is our Lord and he's abundant in power and his understanding is beyond measure amen Jeremiah 32 says oh Lord God it is you that has made the heavens and the Earth by your great power and by your outstretched harm nothing is too hard for you amen so we're looking at a great God that amen that holds the world in his hand hands and blew it off of his fingertips as it were and created the stars and created the Sun and created this little Dot and all of this that we're living in and then all of this Great Dot there's a little dot called you on there and you are in his mind and he's not forgotten about you that's how great this God is he said how could he said not even natat could bad desire or a flea could flicker or a bird could fall to the ground see God was trying to show you the express uh uh how how how how Mighty he is and how great he is that he's he's on every little situation he's watching every little detail there's nothing that's getting by him amen he's not like a man that can be in a room and may not notice this or that or whatever but God notices every detail of Our Lives he notices everything that we go through job says that he's a wise God and hard and and mighty and strength and amen he said so who can Harden thems against him and succeed so if God if you're a seed of God I love that scripture because if you're a seed of God yeah you may harden yourself and you may harden yourself and become hard but you will not succeed because if there's a seed on the inside of you that God's going to go down to where it's at and bring it to life amen so that ought to give us confidence even about our own children and things that we're dealing with in everyday life that God has these things in control that every seed will will bring forth of its kind amen there's not a seed that God has planted that will not come up but it's been predestinated to life amen 1 Chronicles 29 says yours oh Lord is the greatness and the power and the glory and the Victory and the Majesty for all that is in heaven and all that is in Earth is yours yours is the kingdom of Lord and you are exalted as head above all amen so I'm here to remind the devil again he's not in charge he's not in charge of your life he's not in charge of your situation he's not in charge of your body he's not in charge of your children he has no nothing to say Amen well butless God gives him the ability or the the moment to do something only God can do that but he has nothing he can do or say without the permission of almighty God and God has not walked off the job but he's still standing here in complete control and he's watching watching over us even now he's watching over your children he's watching over your life he's watching over your body he's watching over your finances God is in control amen so we find here amen that there was something that was lost we know the book the book that was in that was in in limbo so to speak it was it it was back to its original owner but because it had been forfeited by a son and the first son of God's race Adam and forfeited that rights to that book what did he do he accepted Satan's wisdom instead of God's word amen this is where we get off track is when we accept Satan's wisdom that's why the Bible says we need to cast down every imagination and every thought that would ex exalt itself against the things of God Amen he said sons of God sometimes will take seminaries idea about it instead of the word of God see same thing Abra Adam did he forfeited his rights to that when he did it it went right back to where it was right back to God again it went right back to the original holder but John as we heard I thought this is wonderful I already had this quote and John in the spirit yeah we heard about getting in the spirit if you want to see what God is doing you're going to have to get in the spirit amen the world is getting in the spirit amen we're going to have to get in the spirit as our our pastor so eloquently said us on Sunday but amen he got in the spirit standing up here in heaven looking lifted up amen saw those things he said he said there in chapter four come up higher he said here was John he got in the spirit amen here he was in his church age here he was in his flesh but he was caught up to see those things right amen and here we are in our church age here we are in our in our flesh but somebody's going to be caught up to see the things of of God the presence of God Among Us that is more than a man that is dictating these things is more than a man that's in control well I'm so happy Trump got elected well I'm here to tell you Trump's not in control amen if the other one who got elected she would not been in control God is in control of this thing and he's bringing it down to an end time amen there's prophecies that's got to be fulfilled and they are being fulfilled what we got to be careful of is we're seeing it happen amen we're seeing the word [Applause] fulfill but here's the book of redemption here's the Plan of Redemption the only way you'll ever re be redeemed is there's a titled deed of the whole heavens and earth and someone must come forward to redeem it someone must come forward and he said it couldn't be an angel all right it had to be a Kinsman Redeemer had to be someone like us oh my Hallelujah cuz what good would the the word be just in God's hands he wanted it back in man's hands again amen so he said look at it's like this oh my now speak or forever hold your peace but let him come forward and claim this book who's worthy and John said there's no man in heaven and no man on Earth that was worthy and was found worthy no man beneath the Earth that ever lived or died that was found worthy no man was worthy the Angel's call was for a kinsman redeemer amen that as God said I have a law a kinsman redeemer can be a substitute where is that King kinsman redeemer who's able to do it and it came from Adam all the way down through the apostles and the prophets and everyone that already died nobody in heaven nobody in Earth nobody had ever Liv Elijah Moses didn't matter all the angels and there was no one found worthy that's right cuz he asked for a Kinsman and he said John said no man was worthy so it wasn't like there wasn't world world worthy people like an angel for instance would you know he'd say you know a worthy beings he said like Gabriel or or Michael or but it had to be a Kinsman not an angel not a seraphim they had they hadn't sinned but they had they were in a different category because they had never fallen before before amen so it had to be a kinsman redeemer no man because there was none of them had been redeemed so no man no man was worthy to take it he said it looked it took a Kinsman he asked for it and he wasn't there nobody my he said that's pretty strong but there was nobody available so the Bible said John wept cuz he knew if nobody come then everything was lost there would not be no Resurrection ction there would not be no change of the body there would not be anything like this take place if he didn't step out and John wept and he said here's what I think he wept for because no one was worthy and could open the book of redemption and if no one was worthy the whole creation was lost here's the book here's a little title D but it would be offered to the Kinsman that can meet the qualifications he said but John looked and he looked this way and he looked that way he looked that way and no one was worthy and he be to weep he said but his crying didn't last for just a minute oh I got to thinking about that when you realize there is a worthy one when you realize there is somebody that has taken your case that has taken what you have done and wiped away your sins amen amen it'll take away your Gloom it'll take away your doubt it'll take away your unbelief when you see it's not me that's worthy but I have a worthy lamb Hallelujah absolutely and you'll realize all the crying that's taken place in 6,000 years 6,000 years of crying crying at grav sides crying at lost loved ones crying about this crying about the Gloom yeah when you you look at it in the grand scheme of things 6,000 years of human little little little Drop In The Eternity Circle 6,000 years and then you add all of eternity to it you won't be crying long amen 20 if you live 60 80 years 100 years you're not going to be crying long amen because all of these things are going to be made right I think about brother Brandon as he talks about a mother's day he said he said when those Majestic hands come down and begin to untangle all the knots that's in your mind and he'll tell you don't weep no more don't cry no more it's all over now amen we won't be crying long oh my where is the man I want a man that's able to do it I want a man that can redeem and John just broke loose everything was lost and he wept bitterly he was sad seemed like it was lost rights of redemption the rights of eternal life the right to live all these rights would be forfeited and John started crying because no one was worthy no one could even look at the book it took a human being and John wept and there came a voice from one of the elders standing in the midst of the throne and said that great host of Heaven said don't weep John he said oh my the grace of of God don't be brokenhearted John don't weep for the line of the tribe of Judah the root and offspring of David he has prevailed yes he and I'm here Proclaim it again he has prevailed brother Timothy what about my situation he has prevailed what about my children he has prevailed what about the situation that I got to face tomorrow he has prevailed what about my sickness he has [Applause] prevailed prevailed means he wrestled with it and he overcame it hallelujah amen oh my The Garden of Gethsemane when the Bloods dropped down of his face sweat turned into blood he was overcoming the line and the root of David overcame he prevailed like Jacob the supplanter amen when he got in contact with the angel and he held on the angel tried to pull away and said I'm not going to let you go he held on until he got what he wanted and his name was changed from supplanter which means deceiver to what a prince with God why because he prevailed and the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed so we don't have to weep about it John for the lion has prevailed the root of David has prevailed he's already overcome it he's already done it it is finished what do you say about cancer brother Timothy he have prevailed Hallelujah he's already overcome he's done it's over John he prevailed he produced a bleach that sins sin sins sin back to the GRE hands of the devil hallelujah what what I got to do to get some of that bleach repent it's that simple just say I'm talking about not just not not true repentance is not repenting because you're sorry you got caught true repentance is repenting amen because there's great sorrow of your heart that you did wrong and you know you did wrong so you just say Lord I'm sorry yes amen I love how how I believe it brother John Andes used that example one time at Youth Camp if I remember at all he he talks about how there was brother Bron was having a a a line a healing line he said now if you got something in your heart step out of the line and say Lord I'm sorry step back into the line get back and [Music] step it's that simple when when you do wrong and we all have done wrong how many's ever done wrong in this building we all have done wrong but when you repent and you say God I'm sorry then get back in L and March on in Victory amen march on that God has taken your case and he took that that bleach and he put it upon your sin and he wrote it right back down on your accuser and it's not your sin no more it's back on who it belongs to Hallelujah never somebody say never never to be remembered again that's right amen he said I see the artist that painted his picture you know they make uh sculptures of it or we used we got one hanging up there of his crucifixion you know we always put a cloth around it he says and they wrap him with a bunch of cloths he said brother they did every deg graceful thing they could do to him they stripped him they beat him they done everything they could to him why for you for me he had to pay the penalty for our sins he had to pay the full penalty but there but that's where he conquered amen that sin that's where he conquered death that's where he conquered hell that's where he conquered the grave that's where he conquered your peace why can I be at peace brother timoy when it seems like all is going on cuz the lion has prevailed the lamb has prevailed God is on the SE and he hasn't walked off but he's still in charge of your situation on Amen he's he's conquered you for your peace that's where he conquered for your healing yes your healing is already done it's time we latch on to that amen like Jacob did that angel and not let go until we get what we come for amen hang on to that promise God said it's done so if he said it I believe it amen that's where he conquered your healing that's where he paid the price that's what God's Pro requirement was he he took the blister and stained out of sin for you Hallelujah wow I love that he took the blister and the stain out of sin for you Jesus at the age of 33 had conquered Devils they knew him they knew him they said we know who you are the Holy One Of God that's funny the Ministerial Association that day didn't know him they they called him a b above they called him a illegitimate child but Devils knew who he was yes so I guess that sounds funny I don't know if I should say that you know I always say this brother this not this is not what I was going to say okay we had I said I've said it before and I'll say it again we had all those manifestations of demons Our Youth Camp my son Andrew said you know the Devil he's really stupid he said he showed up and showed us that he's real he showed us that he can actually take a body and make it become manifest and a voice speak out that ain't that girl's Voice or ain't that boy's voice and he said in doing so he showed me that if he's real God's real Hallelujah what should the things that you face show you the sicknesses that you face show you the situations that you face show you it ought to show you that God is real that God is even now when you don't see him working he's still working when you don't know how he's going to do it you don't know how it's going to come together got to do it anyhow and go right beyond what you think or could even ask I was going okay I'll say it I it gets pretty bad if you want to know if God's real you got to ask a devil you you ask the Sadducees they couldn't tell you Pharisees they couldn't tell you through our day they couldn't tell you they call they call the working of God all kind of ugly names and today they're doing the same amen they call all kind kind of stuff but I tell you what when the devil sees it they know it's real amen why why did that girl laying in that in that that demonic possession in that room began to scream out no when brother Aaron come walking in the room it wasn't because of brother Aon it was because of the life that was in brother Aon amen cuz we know that cuz the seven sons of ska they tried to do the very same thing and them Devils tore them in pieces amen because they didn't know God the god that they proclaimed to no but you get somebody filled with the Holy Ghost the devil's going to scream no it's going to scream and holler cuz it knows that's a real life inside of there it met him 2,000 years ago it met him there when he stepped out of a boat when there was a maniac out of his mind and he come running up to tear him apart and he realized uhoh I done come to the wrong guy because inside of there's the same one that was in the Garden of Eden it's the same one one who was there in heaven it's the same one standing right here before me and they begin to scream and holler and ask for plea deals yeah why because there was somebody there that was in charge over them that's saying God is here still yet you know we know who you are the Holy One Of God why do you come to torment us before our time knowing that they had a future punishment coming hello somebody if a devil can believe he's got an end how come you can't believe you got a beginning they had a future punishment coming he conquered sickness at the touch of his hand fevers departed at the touch of his hand he conquered everything well you said you know a woman came to me not long ago said brother Mr brandom said I like to hear you speak there's one thing that you do have that's wrong I said well sister I I'd be very glad to be straightened up if I got anything wrong that's what I'm here for and she said she belonged to a church that does not believe in the Supreme D of to of the Lord Jesus Christ huh and they think he's a prophet and he's just a prophet just a man he I don't say this to hurted feelings anyone knows it and I don't take up for anybody's religion to condemn anybody's she was Christian Science and they believe in healing and so forth but they believe that Jesus was virgin born they didn't believe that Jesus was a virgin born son of God they didn't accept his blood and and he said if you do that it takes all the cream amen that's the very Lifeline of Christianity he said but she said Mr Brandon you said he was he was a fundamentalist as far as I know I believe every word the Bible says and if you'll prove it by if I prove it by your Bible there was nothing but a man you make him God I said he was God he was a God man she said I can prove that he wasn't Divine by your Bible I said lady do it if you can do it she said all right it's in St John the 11th chapter when Jesus was going to the grave of Lazarus and the Bible said he wept Mr brandom could you believe he'd be divine and weep he could not be divine and then weep I said lady you failed to see who he was he was a man on the outside but on the inside he was Jehovah God Amen see there was a time for weeping but then there came a time to speak amen and the life that was inside of him conquered death why because he said I am the resurrection of the life he said he was a man when he was weeping but when he stood at the grave and those skin worms were crawling through their body and he straightened that little figure up and he said Lazarus come forth and man had been dead 4 days stood to his feet and lived again I say that was more than a man that was a conqueror and who was speaking out of him she said if you don't believe that I'll go a little better than that he was a man when he come down off the mountain hungry looking for a fig to eat he was hungry but when he took five little biscuits and two fish and fed 5,000 that was more than a man that was God speaking through human lips true it's true he was a man when he's laying in the back of a boat out on a stormy sea and the boat was tossed up up and down 10,000 Devils of the sea had swore they drown him that night he was tired he was man tired he was laid in the back of boat as a man but W once he was aroused and walked forward and put his foot on the bread of the boat and looked up towards heaven and said peace be still the winds and the wave obeyed him that was more than a man speaking there that was God the mighty conqueror he spoke to the wind and it went to the cave like a puppy dog in the sight of a lion he spoke to the waves and they folded their hands and perfect rest upon the Sea's bosom he was more than a man he was the mighty God the Conqueror he could conquer n nature he could conquer death he conquered waves he conquered air there he is there's never been one like him I know you think I'm excited maybe I am but let me alone you may think I'm crazy I'm a lot happier this way than I was the other way Hallelujah I'd rather be this way oh my when I think of who he is he cried for Mercy like a man at a cross but on Easter morning on Easter morning the Roman seal had tried to seal him in the Tomb amen I put a stone but what happened on that morning when the word came flesh the prophecy came manifestation amen out of that tomb came Jesus that's right I don't know who had who said this or who said it first but I'll say it again he didn't roll away the stone for his good he rolled it away for yours that's right cuz he could go through walls he did it he can eat fish and break bread like he did before and will vanish and go right through a wall he didn't need that stone rolled away for his own benefit he did it for your benefit hallelujah amen and that stone that had kept him in there was trying to be sealed by Roman seal it all bursted forth that morning that great Easter morning and all the Gloom was rolled away at the rolling away of that stone and that stone was rolled down and an angel descended and sat upon that stone what was he showing he was showing I have power over death hell and the grave and when it's time for my word to be fulfilled there ain't enough Romans there ain't enough decrees there ain't enough man there ain't enough anything in this world that'll keep my word from being fulfilled and he's sitting upon the throne showing you up on that stone throwing you showing you that he has dominion over everything amen and he's also got had showed in this day in your life you once were Bound in a tomb somewhere dead is Darkness but a voice called your name and the stone was roll away amen and God showed you he still has dominion over everything he has dominion over everything the devil ever tried to keep you bound with Hallelujah he tried to keep you bound with cigarettes or alcohol or pornography or whatever amen whatever gloom and doubts and worries and fears suicide whatever it is but God rich in Mercy when it's time for his prophecy to be fulfilled you can line every devil up believe me they tried when you came to Christ they tried to line up they tried to stop it but they couldn't they tried to make it not happen but they couldn't but God spoke why because he has prevailed he has prevailed and he has the book in his hand who's in the book I'm in the book you're in the book you're in the book and when I John saw my name when I saw that book and it had been opened by the one who prevailed everything in heaven everything on the earth everything of the earth heard me John shouting listen we are not living in the time of weep and mourning and our heads down and we're all tore up about situation we're living in the time of conquerors we're living in a time where people are walking out with their victory over cancer they're walking out with their victory over sugar diabetes they're walking out with their victory over high blood pressure hall hallelujah they're walking out with their Victory flag I once was a sinner I once was lost but now I'm saved I once was bound and they sang a new song that's [Applause] right you can take your old songs of Gloom they ain't my songs you can take your old songs of I'm a sinner I'm a this I'm a no ain't who I am I'm a Child of God I'm a friend of God he bought me he paid for for me he he he put his his he put me in the in the palm of his hands right he took my scars so I didn't have to take them the lion the lamb that's amazing he said the lion has prevailed said but when he turned around and looked it was a lamb it was God coming down and in flesh taking on human battles walking and dealing with everyday things he dealt with Wednesdays he dealt with Mondays he dealt with every day he dealt with friends leaving him he dealt with church splits come on now he dealt with it all he was tempted in all things that's right but he prevailed that's right Lord Hallelujah he went through church splits but he prevailed he went through sicknesses but he prevailed come on now he had friends walk away but he prevailed why cuz it wasn't him it was what was on the inside of him so shall it be in this day there's going to be somebody to him that overcometh in the lean Church to him him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my Throne just as I overcame and sat down with my father in his throne so just as he overcame there's somebody upon this Earth that's going to get the Same Spirit that's right and if they got the same Spirit they'll have the same power they'll have the same anointing they have the same God living on the inside of them and they too shall [Applause] Prevail he cried for mercy mer at AC cross but he broke the seal and rode away the stone and came out the mighty conqueror poets would be so inspired to they say live and he loved me die and he saved me buried he carried my sins far away but Rising he justified freed me forever someday he's coming oh glorious day oh the mighty conqueror he died as a witness to the Earth to the W to a witness to the prophets that 33 years old he conquered the cross he conquered shame he conquered every devil I want to say that again for some hard-headed Devils he conquered every devil he conquered every devil and when he was dying Jehovah God turned his face on him and he died alone forsaken by God and man in the midst of it all but he was more than a conqueror he said oh I feel pretty religious right now he was more than a conqueror in face of every difficult death itself a forsaken of God he walked to the front like a conquerer he died in such a way to even people who stood by had to witness that he was truly who he said he was the moon and stars testified they refused to shine the Centurion said truly that was the son of God pilate says I ought wash my hands from him good luck Judas said I betrayed innocent blood everything had to recognize him and he's been prophesied since the Garden of Eden the woman's seed and here he was it spoke forward to that time when the greatest conqueror when he would come and Conquer everything that Adam lost in the fall he redeem it back to man again there was no King no Monarch no potentate no nothing that could take that place it had to be Jesus Christ Al and when he died the the Bible said he descended into hell and preached to the souls that were in prison and repented not for the longsuffering days of Noah I can see him after he bowed his head and the Earth shook I can see him descending down into the regions of the lost and he knocks on the door yeah and the doors of hell open and if there in there were tens of thousands millions of young ladies and men they walked the streets all fixed up and thought there were something but failed to to hear the message of their day stiff necked church members who turned their back he said I am the one that Enoch said would come I am he that Enoch said would come you failed to hear my Prophet oh they began to scream oh mercy but there was no mercy the door was closed and down on past the the demons that had already recognized the very doors of Hell the doors open and there stood Satan oh you finally arrived did you I thought I had you when I had Abel I thought I had you when I killed the prophets I thought I had you when that seed that was promised was killed there in Abraham Satan has always looked for that seed he knew that seed would be the Conqueror but now here you are in hell I got you just as John didn't weep long the devil didn't laugh long thank you Lord that was good amen just as John didn't weep long the devil didn't laugh long and I'm here to tell the devil his laughing days are just about over you want to laugh at this one and make fun of that one and post this and post that your laughing days are just about over with the door is going to shut your faith and mercy will be over with oh now I got you he said I can see him walk over to the devil put his hand to his face say Satan you've been in Authority a long time but I am the Virgin born son of God my blood still W on the cross and I've come here to take over and I can see him reach on Satan's side and jerk the keys of death and hell and hang them on his own side and Satan would have tried to fight and push back but he slammed the door in his face and he took over he conquered hell yes sir my God can you imagine fighting from a conquered place that's what the devil's doing he's fighting from a conquered position look how much he fights from a conquered position position how much more should we fight from a position that cannot be conquered from a place that'll never lose from a place that God has come and set his own presence in and his own presence is now abiding in people once again and you're fighting from a place that can't lose doesn't matter what happens you can't lose Hallelujah it doesn't matter if this one walks away or that one walks away you can lose it doesn't matter if your body's riddle with sickness you cannot lose cuz God has conquered it already you've already won he conquered every enemy that Satan had he conquered everything what did he do he set out and he conquered sickness there's there could be no sickness around him wherever sickness was he conquered it what did he do when he conquered it he gave us the keys hello somebody you need to remind the devil you got the keys to his own house amen he doesn't have dominion over you come on he doesn't have dominion over you he does not have power over you he doesn't even have the keys of the power of his own house he's a bluff he's a bunch of noise yeah and he's say he's he's going about as a roaring lineon not a roaring line as a roaring line he's trying to impersonate a real lion he's trying to impersonate it and act like he's in control and act like he's a conqueror he is not a conqueror he's already been conquered that's right but there is a conqueror in this building tonight yes hallelujah amen it's the same yesterday today and forever it's the one that called you by name and brought you to this place where you're at he has not lost you he didn't bring you this far to leave you he didn't teach you to swim to let you drown no but he the one that called you he's the author he authored your life he'll also finish it he's the one with a pen in his hand and it's up to him how he writes the chapters of our life he conquered every Temptation he conquered it all so we could resist the devil and he will flee from you he conquered sickness he conquered Temptation he broke down the gates he took the key and he handed it over to every believer of Abraham's seed and he said if he tempts you resist him and he will flee hello don't sound like a real strong dude does it comes against a little child daughter of God in her mind mind begins to try to torment her and she begins to put the word of God in her mind resist and he flees what's he scared of 110 PBS no you're not scared of that he's scared of what's on the inside he conquered everything he conquered hell he conquered the grave he conquered Temptation he's and now we are more than conquerors to him that loved us and he gave his life for us be in Royal seat of Abraham with the same spirit of God that was in him now in us we're more than conquerors every gate has been conquered the only thing we have to do is possess it because it's already been conquered sicknesses are conquered death is conquered health is why you keep saying this cuz I want the devil to hear it and I want you to hear it hell is conquered the grave is conquered everything and we hold the keys by his grace by his grace listen we're we're past the time of gloom and doubt and worry how is all this going to end how is all this going to be how is this day going to go it's going to go as God has decreed it to go just walk in faith and not by sight because if you walk by sight you'll see all kind of things around you and you'll start sinking as PE Peter did on the waves why he was standing right before the one who had conquered all this we're talking about but he started looking at all this because he thought it was greater apparently he thought that the waves around him was greater than the one standing in front of him and when you begin to think that the waves that Satan makes in your life and the situation he makes a riseon your life is greater than the one who's called you he will conquer you but if you'll keep your eyes on Jesus wipe those tears away and say the lamb has prevailed he's in control of this situation and no matter what happens I know he is in control that's B our hearts got a ton more we could go through but I just feel to just stop weep not quit crying quit don't moan about it groan about it look to your lamb that's prevailed Look to Him brother Phil can you sing that song Look to Him I know I'm springing one on you but that song been on my heart should have asked you before maybe do you play that Andrew Look to Him that's what we got to do brother Timothy what about the waves look to Jesus what about the situation look to Jesus what about the problems around look to Jesus Keep Your Eyes on him keep your eyes on him how many we just say Lord let me turn my eyes away from the things of this world turn them on you Lord with my whole heart
