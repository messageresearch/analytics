different sort of service and outdoors and [Music] sleeping outdoors camping outdoors you know i i told them i think it's good you know you get out of your comfort zone and comfortable places where you've been comfortable and just get away from that get away from a certain building and just realize it's truly between you and god doesn't matter where you're at it's between you and him you can have church no matter where you're at amen and so the church is not a building the church is the people amen and so we we were able to have a wonderful time of of just rejoicing in the things of god and god brought many deliverances there as you can see my voice has been weak from that because it was a very damp environment from the fog and things that would settle in in the evenings but amen god was so good to us we're thankful to him for all that he'd done amen we just i don't think we have any prayer requests here maybe something that was emailed in asking for prayer for a family the cherry family needing a situation taken care of in their home how many would have a need you want to make known to the lord today amen brother joe could you come and open our service in prayer i know there are others around that are sick and even in our midst for the tim winters not able to be here this morning amen this wednesday night i believe when the little conroy girls broke in fella broke fell and broke her arm and so we want to remember her this morning she's facing surgery looks like but we know the great physician he can put it all together when the doctors came and he's the one that does the healing anyhow so we just ask the lord to move on there's on the scene for her god bless you today let's just take these knees to him this morning the bible says that his mercies are new each and every day as we start this new year out we have plenty of days ahead to tap into the mercies of god may this be one of those days this morning may this be your morning where god comes down expressly to you and ministers to your need to your heart's desire because his mercies are new lord i'm reaching out to you this morning in touch of some mercy father in need of your grace this

find help in our time of need lord we've spent much time in preparation for this moment and i'm sure there are many o god that have even spent their own personal time and preparation lord anticipating the moment of this service and oh god we are here today as a witness as a testimonies that the devil can't stop our hallelujahs the enemy cannot stop our rejoicing that there's nothing that he's done though all hell has assailed us we will not be moved for we're anchored in the rock of ages and we're here today as a children of god gathered in your name asking lord that you'll bless us that you'll minister to us speak to us lord to the word as we read it together may you just burn in our hearts and i pray dear god you'll just help me to get out of the way today and let the holy spirit speak lord as we give the testimony of jesus christ and the testimony of jesus christ is the spirit of prophecy when a man of god gets in the anointing of the spirit he prophesies unto the spirit may my words today be more than the words of a human being that fails but oh god may the holy spirit take over this vessel and i speak as an oracle of god i realize lord my own human inability is my own human weakness but i know how great a god you are and that the spirit will speak expressly to the church lord let him speak today your god for you said the words that i speak they are spirit and they

personality cult if i could do anything let me point them to you lord that you become their leader and you're they're guided lord i pray it would be not just for them out there but also for this local assembly may they make you the king of their lives you speak to their hearts today every need supply now lord they're sick among us heal them they're sick that are not able to be here heal them lord there's coping ravaging through the land and we meet in the face of all of that and we defy every enemy because we come in the name of the lord we are coming obediently lord as you commanded us to to forsake not the sibling of ourselves together so now we're asking lord you just put a wall of fire about us so there'd be nothing now to fear may there not be one fear among us but let perfect love cast out all fear i ask it in jesus name thank you for your promises they are to us yes yes they're true and amen we have to agree to it lord so we say an amen back to the word lord today let the amen

[Music] amen thank you praise god turn with me to joshua chapter one and many of you i i just wonder how many of you got to listen to either one or two or both of those services brother branham said i raise your hand let me just see you you got to listen to it god bless you thank you for doing that i if you if you did that you recognize that was a stanza of one of the songs that he's saying and and uh in in those services i've got peace like a river amen we was asking the church here preparing for this service to listen to the two sermons on the rejected king and if you haven't done your homework well you know hope you can do it amen i know it'll bless you amen joshua chapter 1 and verse 1. now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of nun moses ministers saying moses my servant is dead now therefore rise and go over this jordan thou and all this people unto the land which i do give them even to the children of israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that i have i given unto you as i said unto moses from the wilderness and this lebanon even unto the great river the river euphrates all the land of the hittites unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your coast there shall not be any man there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee be of strong and of good courage for unto this people shalt thou divide for inheritance the land which i swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observed to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that's written therein for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success have not i commanded thee be strong and of good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee that's shouting grounds right there whether so ever thou goest amen what a word for the new year to come amen god bless you you can be seated actually one of the last sermons on 2019 in december was taken from this chapter and now we have just um finished um 2021 and we start out a new year i'm back here at the same place in the scripture and today we're going to be speaking on possessing the land and i have a a subtitle for this that we'll get into more this evening i hope you're prepared for two services today amen there is not going to be a light fair a light fair today it's going to be a full spread amen so you know we're going to be given all that we have today as we look into this but the second part will be more on bringing forth the king but today we're in this part we're going to be uh setting the platform for that making preparations to bring forth the king now so as we as we look at this as i said one uh one of the things is we heard the song a moment ago that the devil doesn't have enough that god's a mighty conqueror and we're here today standing here by the grace of god i think of a dream that i had in march of 20 uh 2020 as we were beginning the year and the early part of that year that i had a dream that i was i was straightening out a highway and i was making the preparations for a road and and um you know straightening out its curves and pulling down its heels and making a a a a a real highway for to to ride upon and um and so as i as i did um someone stopped and and came a very angry a group of men and one of them pulled a pulled a pistol and pull it out and aimed it straight at me point blake was in about within you know seven or eight feet away and just point blank and shot shot me and as it did i woke up with the sound of the pistol but i was i was totally unharmed you know it never touched me and i i you know it totally missed and that's exactly what i say to satan i've been shot at but you missed i'm still standing here and we're still going to make the preparation for the coming of the lord prepare a people in their hearts for his coming and i believe that i'm a part of the forerunner ministry who was to make straight that path for the coming of the messiah and of course we know the message started as with john the baptist as he forerunned the first coming of christ and um and then of course then we we hear of the same thing being told in this last day that there had to be a highway prepared for the lord to come and we're still in the very phases of his coming and so there still must be preparations made to receive the king so now as we thought i think of this um you know joshua of course as you remember he was a one of those two spies he went to spy out the lamb he was a forerunner going into that land no one had ever been there before and go and and moses would send 12 men and they would go in as forerunners to come and tell them about this land that none of them had ever seen and it was a land that moses had never seen none of israel had ever seen it you would think you know moses meets the pillar of fire and he said you're to take him to that land that moses would have went down and scouted it all out and said you know is it really is it really there you know where is it i'm taking them to but no moses has never been there nobody none of them had ever been there and they had left egypt to go to a land unseen that they'd only heard of that was only written in the word before them and spoken of by prophets before them yet no one had ever been there before and there were two of them that went that were of a different spirit than the rest of the spies i mean they they had a different spirit they had a spirit about them of we're going to this land and we're going there to bring back the report of what kind of a land it is and we're going to testify of what god's word said no matter what we see we're going to testify what god's word said because even if we see desert lands we know the transforming power of god can turn it into a land flowing of milk and honey it really doesn't matter what our eyes are going to see we're going to bring back witness of what the word said amen and joshua and caleb would return back with the evidence of the fruit of that land oh i love thinking about it they come back with three fruits three pools of his of it bearing the fruit of that lamb they brought back clusters of grapes that two men had to pack they they brought back pomegranates and figs and they brought back the fruit of the land that they'd never seen and they could come back and say the land is really there i've been on it i've seen its mountains i've seen its valleys i've seen its waters i all influenced with milk and honey amen the land is real it is there in other words it's a fertile land and there's lots of room for cattle to get milk and and there's lots of grass there what they can eat and lots of lots of blossoms so there's so much that the bees can have sweet nectar to make honey it flows with milk and honey it's a goodly land let us go up at once and possess it joshua his name meant jehovah's savior two thousand years later there would come another joshua yeshua yeshua is we call him jesus because in our translators in the king james it would to differentiate between the joshua of the old testament they would they would use the greek form of the name joshua to call his name jesus but he is joshua or yeshua which means jehovah the savior you see joshua the old testament was only it was only portraying and speaking of the greater joshua that would come amen and jesus there would he was also a forerunner the bible said he was the forerunner that went into the veil the bible calls him a forerunner and he went into the realms of the blessed and he brought back evidence of the land and he showed us there is life after death hallelujah there is resurrection power promised to the believer amen he brings back the fruit of that other land and it shows there's an empty tomb come on somebody amen there's a resurrected saints i didn't raise the lawn but with me came all the saints of the old testament hallelujah not one left in paradise not one left there in a holding place but every one of them brought back and glorified amen here's the evidence of glorified saints and here's the evidence of a glorified body amen because here i am thomas feel my hands feel my feet put your hands in my sight i'm real it's true it's a real land there is life after death come on church amen i've been to that round and i conquered death and i conquered hell and i rose up on the third day and i'm alive forevermore hallelujah but more than that i want to give you an evidence i want you to taste of it i'm going to pour out resurrected life on the day of pentecost and on that day of pentacles you will be filled with the evidence of that lamb [Applause] it will be it will be the deposit amen this this taste this taste of the holy ghost will be a deposit until you get the full inheritance it's not all of it it's a forechase this is what joshua and caleb would say the grapes are this big two of us had to pack it the pomegranates are this sweet hey man the the pigs are this this wonderful here is all of this and it's proof the land exists and jesus brings back proof of that land and it gives us an abstract title d to the land a deposit the baptism of the holy ghost now 2 000 years later seven church ages god is not leaving us without a witness we're here now as a fulfilling of all the types now i'm just going to digress a minute and i'll pick up the stock because i want you to kind of get an overview of where i'm going because in my in my own personal devotions i have just finished all of the chapters of the book of joshua then i was going to go to the book of judges which follows judge which follows joshua but instead my finger hit as i was listening to a bible app my finger hid upon the book of ruth so i listened to the book of ruth then i go back to the book of joshua and then i go through the book of samuel now as we're looking at this we're going to be today as i as we're looking at this we're going to be looking at going into the land of promises that we're at with the purpose of bringing forth the king so i'm laying some background here and as i do i want you to see a forerunner has already went and he comes to take you into a realm that has been previously unknown and and it's been written about in the scripture but it's not known until a personal witness goes over is just when caleb brings back report and it's jesus the second joshua goes over into and gets the report now 2000 years later here we are again we're now here in the in another place where god is not leaving us without a witness but once again god sends a messenger he sends a forerunner i mean he even wants to make it so plain that he will actually have a bible come out from out of the ceiling and come down like this and appear there as brother branham will watch this and then the scriptures unfold to joshua chapter one and then the first fingers there of his finger go down verses 1 through 9 right here joshua chapter 1 through 9. and so as it does as it does you know he's telling him as i was with moses so will i be with you just don't do not do not move from the word you got to stay on the promise don't let nothing move you off of that amen i give you a promise you can take the land take it all take every bit of it amen and so with you know in that land that we would be able to see things through the prophetic eye amen as a forerunner allowed us to look through his eyes and brings that back to us jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and with the first pull of his ministry he would show us the fruits of the land and there would be the power of healing because there's healing in this land hallelujah the power of healing and the land is miracles and the blind would see and the death heard the dumb spoke and the lame walked come on church amen what was god doing he was showing you evidence i'm a living god the land is real amen what i said in the word is true i'm the healer of ever disease amen i am there for you i am to be god over you come on church and this is your land in it is miracles and it is healing and it is deliverance and it is salvation every bit of it lays within this land and he would show it and let us all taste of it and hear of it hey man i'm sure the elders would get to take it but maybe there wasn't enough to go to every other but everybody could hear the elders report it's good it tastes wonderful it's real here's fruits of it you know in fort wayne indiana when praying for a child with polio and was unable to walk the pianist was playing the great position now is near the sympathizing jesus and he took a a child in his arms that was a afflicted with polio and he began to pray over this hideously crippled child whose limbs were useless and as he began to pray a bright light appeared over him shining brightly in his face and and he looks up thinking it's the custodian in the auditorium who is rudely just showing on bright lights upon him and he opens his eyes to to say to say please uh whoever that is don't put that light on me and as he does he sees this huge star coming down from from from up above whirling above him and it's so surprised until he drops the child and the child hit the ground running and began to run to his mother and the mother joyfully reaching out to her son saw the light and fainted and at that moment the pianos jumped up dancing with the spirit speaking of singing in an unknown tongue while the piano kept right on playing hallelujah amen the great position now is near the sympathizing jesus hallelujah what was that showing us fruits of the unseen tangible fruits that the land is real amen oh you remember something similar happened last year's brother timothy was preaching at brother ron spencer's and his he was declaring that god had come down then his ipad which he was about eight feet away from it without a without a watch on that would that would um be programmed with it without any wait for it to happen and the ones on the stage would watch it close out the program of this of his notes open up another program where he never played tapes on or sermons of brother branham select a sermon and start playing there on his ipad and and brother branham began to speak and as he began to speak he was talking about him now timothy's preaching down how he has come down how he is here among us and he's telling about the hymn brother branham is talking about to him there down from his glory and he said it expresses the extreme deity of the lord jesus and especially in a day like this when they try to make him just a prophet he was more than a prophet he was god what was god doing once again declaring he has come down am i more than just sending a prophet but christ has come down and is in our midst and he's opening up the land of the supernatural and he says it's all real for you i want you to know the land it's there that you can possess it all am i whatever it is maybe the enemy has held back something from you you have been there with your complex or you've been there with your heartache or you've been with with your problem let me tell you the land there is flowing with milk and honey it is enough for your marriage it's enough for your home it's enough for your children it's enough healing in it for your sickness it's enough timothy and i would go to his mom's bedside at the icu she'd not spoken in 17 hours when he told her god has come down mother mom god's come down he's here she started singing down from his glory ever living story my god and savior came and jesus was his name born in a manger to his own a stranger a man of sorrow tears and agony and she broke out into the course she started weeping and crying and and singing oh how i love him how i adore him my breath my sunshine my all in all what was it is god showing us he was present in our situation and that the supernatural god is real amen just later just before my wife crossed over brother derek paris who he and his family have now moved here from washington state it was about 6 30 in the morning when he awoke and he awoke too and was awake when a man started walking into his room and he was holding an official document like this holding official document in his hand and trying to hand it to him and he saw him there and he's looking at the paper there and he saw it was an official document and and he was holding it out for him to take and said and he said karen pruitt is being ushered to the other side you see what is that it's god's showing us hallelujah that nothing's out of control that's why i could rejoice the other night when philip sang oh i know if his eyes on this peril that he i know he was watching over her and welcomed her home into a land flowing with milk and honey hallelujah daryl mouth is the fourth she slipped over into the other side and the old ship a zion carrier over hallelujah and she joins the voices of those on the other side brother branham heard saying keep pressing on just beyond the river there's a better land keep pressing till we meet in that land brother branham as as a joshua crossed the river jordan that barrier between the dimensions of earthly mortal life and the dimensions of the heavenly immortal life with just one breath one breath away moving into another dimension of about 12 feet above his head he by looking back could see his mortal body laying on the bed yet he was alive he had all of his senses except they were greater that and and there he could he could sense a great feeling of of that fundamental element of the nature of god divine love the holy ghost now totally surrounded him in his fullness and he could look down at his hands and he could tell they were young and new he could he looked there at his body and any complete control of his senses he could see he could and back to the matter is not only could he see but he said i had a greater sense of sight there than what i even have here and he said our senses are magnified and he said i i hear i i looked and there were hundreds that were greeting him and they were young and his senses were greater as i said and with one breath he had slipped into the present intermediate heaven of the angelic realm around that is distinctly separate from earth yet having more physical qualities than than you might assume you see he he met thousands of people who who were who are dwelling in tangible physical bodies amen yet in some ways unlike us because they're yet spiritual amen in fact to the matter is he would use the word theophany to describe their condition which means an appearance of god because now they were not just as men but they were now in another form in a spiritual condition yet a physical condition and yep yet in that realm there they could feel and they could be felt they were white robes and he could see at the same time the dimensions of the mortal and the immortal he could look back at his himself laying on the bed and he could look around and see a land a man filled with bluegrass and thousands upon thousands coming waiting to greet him and one's coming to say clapping him on the back and say we've been waiting for you to come amen we knew you were coming and as he did they were wearing clothes of white and women with beautiful long hair and men with theirs probably to you know around their shoulder their teeth were all straight and they shone like pearls their eyes were bright and glistened to stars on the darkened night and with one great big joy they embraced him amen clapping him on the back and loving him and saying we're so glad you are here amen you see we have had a joshua a forerunner bringing back report of that land that the land is real and it flows with milk and honey there's no dying there there's no sickness there there's no yesterday or tomorrow there's no regrets hallelujah it's all one great big joy i think a brother a brother duplicitous in south africa he went to brother willie retice church in johannesburg he died during surgery and he tells of his story of his experience now before the surgery and this is important before his surgery there was a believer's child in israel that kept asking his mom to pray for brother duplicitous and he could be this child could be heard praying at the in at the table in other times asking god to be with brother duplessis no one's in israel and the others in south africa brother sydney jackson a a a a a man who brother madam talked about and who was a spiritual man he had a word from the lord saying brother depresses hospital operation pray another church in cape town south africa and their service their sunday service they all got down and they started praying and the spirit spoke he said brother duplicitous and they felt a compelling urge to pray for him and got down again because the spirit urged upon them calling his name brother duplicitous they all got down to pray you know it's it's so important that we be a people that can hear his voice amen not just the people who talk about something in the past but where god is acting among us and there are men and women that can say i pray from god god spoke to me i hear brother branham say it and hear his voice the prophet spoke of those days when they were for teaching return teach men's doctrine not god's doctrine and we've seen so much of that it's gone on so long and today the word of the lord is a rare thing that someone can come and say thus saith the lord now we've had a lot of impersonations of that and there's a lot of the problem because of the impersonators we want to throw away the real because they have impersonated tongues we don't want nobody speaking in tongues because they've impersonated a misused prophecy and interpretation we don't want that in our church no more so we throw out god because of the impersonators now listen to it he said we've had a lot of impersonations on that satan's really on the job and many years have gone by where people were afraid to say that unless it was the lord but today they don't care but it's a rare thing to hear the voice of the lord and to find a person that can say the lord spoke to me you notice that among the people anymore that they hardly hear a time when they say the lord spoke to me when men and women used to pray all night and their homes were set in order by the book of the lord and god was first in their home amen now you know the bible is very clear like first thessalonians 5 19 says wherefore brother covet to prophesy and forbid not to speak with tongues it says since first corinthians 14 39 wherefore brothers come to prophesy for forbid not just and forbid not to speak with tongues and first thessalonians 5 19 quits not the spirit despise not prophecy and but but you see it's come to a point that nobody wants to hear the voice of god they can hear voices of theology and argue the scripture but to say i heard from god god spoke to me god revealed himself it's hard for people anymore to even have that experience in their lives but there is hope revelation 10 11 he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and people there's going to be a people in the last days can i say it this way there is a people in the last days amen that prophesies that speak the word of god amen and they're doing it before many people and nations and tongues or languages and kings brother duplesses after surgery on his stomach he was transported back to the ward and he found that he as he was coming back that he was choking he couldn't breathe they had what he called pipes or tubes down his throat and he tried his his wife came uh to him there as he was pushed back into the ward and he tried to mount to his wife who's standing near him i can't breathe and she recognized the problem and got the nurse's attention and and and he died there on the table and suddenly he lifted from his body about as high as the door but there as he was there out of his body he said i was in full control of all my senses i could see i felt fine i wasn't sick i wasn't hurting amen here i am outside of my body and i'm looking down on my body that they're working over and said i saw the nurses there um there they were trying to revive my body working over my body and he said i had no pain there was no distress there was no anxiety i was in complete control of this rejoice and he said he watched the doctors as they rest him back to surgery and suddenly he saw a bright light and that moment he was right back into his body again you see god's showing us once again the proof of another land the proof of another land now with the second phase of the fruits the next through the land it showed us the power of the word to discern the thoughts and the intents of the heart that we are known of god amen and it showed us if god could go back 40 years in our life amen he could show a prophet before the foundation of the world what was in god's mind and what god was thinking amen and so so therefore it showed that we were known of god that your name is so-and-so you came from a certain place this is your house number that god is a personal god come on church amen he's not just a distant god teach yourself and wake up do not go to sleep on me this morning i have to come down and preach in your face i'll do it i've spent too much time before the lord to let you miss this amen they're in the presence of god are you with me amen god was making us known i'm a personal god i know your name i know your disease i know your affliction i know your future [Applause] i know your past i know your presence situation and i know your future [Applause] i'm not a distant god i want to be known in this last age as a person of god now it showed us also the word had come down because only the word the son of man discerns the thoughts in the intents of the heart so in the ministry of the son of man which would have to be you know as it was in the days of lot so shall it be when the son of man is revealed where the word is revealed so god would know and and let us know i know your thoughts and i know my thoughts i have to you jeremiah says it well he said i know the thoughts that i have of you they are a peace and not of evil and brother branham says in the message of desperation when he quotes that scripture he said to bring you back to your appointed place and he said that place is pentecost hallelujah because that's exactly the expected year to bring this bride back to the original condition this is what joshua was doing he was bringing them back to abraham's lab to a land of faith to land the promise to a land of change hallelujah where he would change and serve a tree to a land to bring him the seed there's so many parts of this i'm trying to bring it all in to you where you can as i gather together into one vein of possessing what abraham had what he walked over possessing what the apostles had what they walked over possessing what brother branham saw come on church amen possessing complete possession of a new body of a glorified state amen hallelujah amen taking us all the way to bringing forth the king and finally on the third pole the secret mystery truce were restored back to the church the seals taken off open of the book given us the pure message of paul's gospel bringing us back to the gospel of jesus christ so this gospel could be preached into all the world so the end could come now joshua would come to to flood stage of the river i'm going to take my jacket off because we're going to cover a lot of territory today as we go through these parts of the book of joshua as we're heading over in now to the days of samuel and eva and eli we'll get to some of that in the second service but joshua would come at the time of a flood stage of the river jordan where it looked like it was impossible to cross god did not bring them in a time where it was a trickle but where the river now is in blood stage and the people crosses over following the ark and the word had to be placed upon the shoulders of the levites now this is god's ordained way for the ministry to shoulder the word amen for the people to follow the ministry as they carry the word not just follow the ministry but follow the word as the ministry carries the word that's what brother bradham said when you know we we hear it all the time stay with your pastor you know which was said to brother neville but let me say you know it's it's more than that if you hear a prophet saying also if a man leaves the word then you leave the man never leave the word come on joshua is instructed to take this laugh don't turn to the right don't go to the left stay balanced stay right in the center don't get off track follow just that word as i was with moses i will be with you i will not tell you you will possess this land but you got to put your feet on it amen you got to step up my faith for your healing for your salvation for the need that you have you just can't stand back here in your easy chair you're going to fight for every possession of this word this is god's ordained way the ministry shoulder in the word later israel tried something different a man-made ox-cart trying to bring the word but no ox-cart can do it come on church hey man you you know enough of brother branham preaching about this as he preached on trying to do god a service without his will how that in the days of eli when the ark was taken during the battle and then and taken by the philistines and then plagues broke out upon them and finally they returned the ark of the covenant back to israel you see it was the philistines that put the ark on a new ox-cart amen now when david tried to do the same he failed to consult the lord about it and and how to bring it back to jerusalem or bring it to jerusalem and a good man elsa tried to steady the ark come on tried to steady the ark when the odds stumbled and god slew him showing death will happen when someone not ordained to handle the word touches the ark it causes spiritual death amen we got to have god called men god anointed men amen men who are really born preachers born preachers i in your in the world my force saw you and i would change your prophet to the a man who want to try it out for a vocation or a man who goes to school or man who gets smart enough they think i'm a business leader i can lead the church it won't work you go in there and the art and the ox will stumble at some point and you try to steady it you'll be struck dead amen that doesn't matter how anointed they are and how great a desire they have to bring the word back out of false doctrines and out of the wrong place these newfangled man-made ox-carts with their agape tablets it won't do it amen to deny the ministry to shoulder the word the ark of the covenant and put it on the oscar of some man-made system will only cause death remember david's failure is he tried to do god a service without consulting his will he failed to consult the prophet come on amen you got to consult the prophets about this jesus the god prophet said go into all the world and preach now there's no higher authority than that amen he said go into all the world and preach come on church preach he wants the word preached namely he wants men called levites called of god men ordained not men appointed not men that are smart and intellectual but men that are there because god placed them in that position amen for the more the prophet paul said preach the word the last prophet to the gentile ordained ministers to carry the word over and over saying god doesn't use machinery god uses men to preach the gospel amen in the message the ark brother brandon said he talks about the end time and what science has done in the last few years um and just the things that's done nearing the end time assigned to all believers he said ministers in the pulpit should be preaching it with all the force they got amen now listen i'm consulting the prophet amen i'm consulting the prophet how do we carry it amen with god called men ministers in the pulpit preaching it with all the force they got showing to the people we're passing milestones all things put the end the scriptural verse god's bible that we read and the and believe today is pointing to the end not much farther the great scientific world says ian's inside another great milestone the zodiac calendar so forth astronomy everything says he ends in sight the pyramid says he ends in sight and every great point in place says the end is in sight we are at the end time amen in the seven church ages he would he would pray remember the needy of god the poor of our land the poor in spirit and those that are hungry i wonder if there are those today that said i'm hungry then he said god raise up ministers everywhere fill them with the holy spirit send them forth preaching lord like firebrands anointed men god called men god separated man amen of people there who have been there as a forerunner across the river and they themselves have got a deposit of the holy ghost on the inside of them and they know the land is real they're not preaching about somebody else who crossed over and somebody else had got the holy ghost and what they had back there 40 years ago they have experienced himself they know he's a healer they know he's the deliverer they now he's a savior [Music] said we'll only pass this way once we're only mortal once and thanks be to god for that in the next life will not preach the gospel in the next life that is to come that throws your return ministry out the door right there but we rejoice in the gospel with them of the ages who has accepted it with the head captain our lord jesus who's all worthy and all praise be to him forever and ever oh we like to quote from the absolute and here's what is the absolute sermon said no matter what your experience is then if something in you tells you that the bible isn't true that the power of god apostles prophets teachers and pastors and gifts of the spirit isn't just the same as it was when it flowed to them apostles at pentecost there's something wrong with your absolute it has to tie to a denominational creed instead of the bible and that's the problem we're trying to we you know we want to bring the prophet's voice but we want to bring it through some mechanical device because you can't find ordained god called god knowing it man to carry the word but god's got them and they're going to preach it with force we like firebrands i'm not staying here long we're just coming on down but brother branham said now to bring up this faith in christ there are ministers and that's the most important thing of the day is a good god-sent preacher i admire them and their gift is far beyond anything can be done and anything else is a preacher a man who knows how to rightly divide the word of god amen the most wonderful gift in the world is to be a minister which is a new testament modern day prophet a preacher prophesy meets the foretell or tells some personal things in other words you read the bible and and tell then that's a teacher but a prophecy is to to prophesy is to tell or foretell and that's the spirit of christ is prophecy now let me just tell you i mean david now making his ox cart like the denomination did trying to bring the word back you know trying to do well you know they messed it up and they they've done wrong with it and it's in the wrong place and we'll put it in the right place and and all of that but he didn't consult the prophet so he brings it in the way denominations did are you with me amen and of course that's with men that are not called of god on an ox collar and they reach out and try to in good faith study it and it brings spiritual death now i don't care how excited they get they danced on david's day i don't care how anointed they sing i don't care the whole congregation gets up and shouts and they get us emotional it'll cause spiritual death you will never get the word back into position any other way than the bible way of first chronicles 15 15 and the levites carried the ark of god with the poles on their shoulders as moses had commanded in accordance with the word of god brother branham said him trying to do god of service and levi's shoulders was god's original way to do it and they put it on a new ox cart or a new card it'll never work they didn't consult the right thing they got out about it went about it the wrong way and that's what happened when men no matter how sincere try to do a service outside of his provided way of revealing it they always mess up god sends it his way men no matter how sincere you try to do it outside of that you'll mess it up so don't be influenced by these new fang dangles and things they got today i don't care how good a man they are how sincere they are if they don't speak according to the law and the prophets the bible said there's no life in them so tonight now i'm just going to spend just a few more minutes on this we're moving on but to deny that preachers or god's ordained way to carry the word is to deny mark 16. for jesus said preach the word and when you preach it signs will follow even brother branham brought it down he said he didn't say teach the word he said preach the word and to preach the word is to demonstrate it to bring back evidence now preach the gospel the word and souls are saved you know why demons are cast out you don't get a soul saved without casting out devils preach the word to sick you're healed you know why amen demons are cast out amen and you have prayer lines for you lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and anyone who is taking medicine better be praying over it that when you take deadly things it won't hurt you are you with me so brother branham talks about this in the church age book he said paul said the word came in power as well as voice the word preached actually demonstrated itself like a flaming cut and sword it went into the consciousness of man like a surgeon's knife it cut out the diseases it set captives free and everywhere those early believers went they went preaching the gospel the word and god confirmed that word was signed following the sick were healed the devils were cast out they spoke in new tongues that was the word in action and the word has never failed in the mouth of believing christians and in this last age are you with me and this last age that is here stronger and greater than ever in the true word bride so a little flock you little minority hold on the word fill your mouth and heart with it and someday god will give you the kingdom the king will come now so they got across the river they saw the miraculous is what got them into there you don't cross dimensions from the wilderness and to the promised land of the holy ghost the holy ghost it is represent the promised land represents the holy ghost you don't do it without the supernatural only he can make the way through it come on and the first thing that happened when they crossed over jordan was the circumcision of the new generation and that day the reproach of egypt was rolled off of them and i tell you the reproach of denomination will never be rolled off of you until you are circumcised by the holy ghost and enter into covenant with god amen amen that's the only way to roll the approach away you see the reproach of denominational slave life slave mentality is to be circumcised by the holy ghost cut off amen i'm no longer a slave to fear i'm a child of god i'm no longer a slave to sickness i'm a child of god i'm no more a slave come on to habits and sin complexes i'm no longer a slave amen there there oh my in every church there ought to be a hill of foreskins right there pile after pile where the flesh is cut off come on church what sin is done away with and men and women have been filled with the holy ghost entered into covenant with god and i'll tell you if there's never been a time that that the new generation must have it like this generation many of you came out of egypt but you never were circumcised think of it we need a heel of foreskins but before trying to conquer jericho people want the seals broken to them before sin is broken off of them you got to deal with sin first and get the revelation of the holy ghost god's seal on your life first before you get the revelation of the seven seals you need the revelation of christ revealed personally to you you cannot possess the land without being in covenant with god amen so no matter how much you want to claim it you cannot possess it amen it's not yours unless you entered into covenant and the covenant the seal of the covenant is the baptism of the holy ghost which is our circumcision now so there again there's never been a time that the baptism of the holy ghost has been so important as this time remember when moses went down to deliver them and he hadn't circumcised his own son god like to kill him amen but the woman there realized his wife realized you know what was going on and circumcised the child and threw it at him and said here you're a bloody husband to me and and what happened the plague left and if we want the pledge to leave our young people some of you young people are 40 years old because you ain't never had an experience with god but if you want if you want the plug of the plague to leave you you're going to have to be circumcised because you're outside of the covenant and there's too many today around the message have never received the baptism of the holy ghost in his power they've never tasted the new land they don't know it's real they heard other people talk about it and they read about it in the bible and they hear about the prophet but they've never tasted it joshua is looking at them daunting walls of that city of jericho he's wondering how to open up those sealed walls now jericho is sealed closed up and is key to the entrance of the land we in order to take the land we got to first take jericho the seals have got to come off of it the walls has got to come down so it is key to the inheritance and you see the book the book is our land the possession come on somebody amen with people of the book what we've been preaching on for almost four years now we're the people of the book but notice here here again it was sealed with seven seals men had tried to probe into it look at it and guess at it and wonder about it and one thing you see it thinks it means this and another says it means that but it was all speaking in tongues without an interpreter just like in the days of daniel many many tickle your farce and we see it and it's symbolic but we don't know what the symbols mean and we had symbols in the book of revelation and we didn't know what they meant amen but they were key to opening up the rest of the book are you with me amen because these were things that were sealed up white horse rider black a red or black pail had went forth and sealing the book the antichrist moved to close up the contents of the land and so it's all walled up and joshua is standing on the outside looking at that city it's night and he's walking out among the people and he's thinking how am i going to break get in them walls you know maybe he has studied some of the books that moses had brought along on how to win campaigns how to be an egyptian general maybe he studied you know and he looks at some of them and he goes back and and he and he says i i i don't know what i'm going to do i don't know how to get into it there there's got to be a way to that that this book comes open that this land comes open that the walls come down we've got to get into the land amen we we're receiving the holy ghost but there's there's promises that are laying there that belong to us and if we don't get the seals open we're not we're not going to fully see and conquer the rest of the land we're just standing on the edge of it and he's out praying during the night and there he sees a man who has a sword drawn oh i'm glad he's got his sword drawn it's not in his sheath he's a mighty warrior and this is his battle and he comes out against him he said are you forced against us he said no i'm not not either one i have come as the captain of this army i am the leader and i'm going to tell you how to get into that wall you can throw away your books of the egyptians all your past theology amen as brother breton said i hope people are spiritual i would have made a horrible mistake if it hadn't been about 12 o'clock today when the holy spirit came in the room and corrected me on something i was writing down to say i was taken from an old context and i had nothing on it i didn't know this what i don't know what the second seal is no more than nothing it's about i had some old context of things i something i spoke on several years ago and wrote it down and i gathered the context and dr smith and many great outstanding can i in in interject the word and the egyptian teacher and i i'd gathered and uh and all them and what they believed that and i wrote it down i was speaking to say i'll study from that standpoint and there about 12 o'clock in the day the holy spirit just swept down into the room and the whole thing just opened up to me and there it was of this first seal being opened hallelujah what was it he was getting instructions now on how to to bring down the walls amen and he's told what to do as the captain said this is my battle it's the lamb's rights to open the seals and i'm taking charge this won't be william branham taking the seals off the book this won't come by his understanding this is not man's theology come on this is not a seventh grade kentuckian and his ideas amen this is not are you with me this is this is not something that is his intellectual property hallelujah it's not his intellectual property it's not his children's to inherit come on it's not their message it's god's message it don't belong to the branhams come on it don't belong to jeffersonville amen it belongs it comes from the hand of the chief captain it's his message and he said this is my battle i am the lamb and i am opening the seals and i am taking charge hallelujah you'll get a revelation today of who's in charge of this pride it ain't some man-made system it's the lord jesus christ amen the king of kings and the lord of lords hallelujah i said hallelujah those walls will come down those seals will be open tell you what i want you to do i want you to march around at seven days in silence and we did for seven church ages marched around and around you know every day didn't know what to say about it didn't know how to open it amen didn't know the mystery we were we just had to remain silent amen when mighty what this one whispered this and that one whispered that john what was it um matthew henry wrote this and scofield wrote that but nobody knew what they were talking about marching around longing to get in but still sealed out but in the seventh church age on the seventh day on the last day of the march the last day of the journey i want you to march around it seven times as a memorial so we did the first day was ephesus second day seminar third day pergamos third fourth day satire fifth day sardis sixth day fellow philadelphia seventh day laodicea amen and then we then we learned as we went around in the memorial seven times in the last age amen that the messenger of ephesus was paul and then there was irenaeus and martin and columba and luther and wesley hallelujah and prison on the scene was the seventh angel the last messenger come on now amen and so there they were we learned about it as we as we went around observing the walls now amen but there now as we come to that seventh round in laodicea where the restorations of what the fathers had were to be had the silence was broken [Music] with a shout out amen with the sound and the wiles came down come on church what was it it was the shot of the king what was it the lord had descended from heaven with a shout with the message the word had come remember with that shout with that message the walls fell down [Applause] hallelujah say brother tim they're not all down cursed is he that tries to raise up jericho again amount then the seal walls are broken and they were commissioned to possess the land and drive out the inhabitants see we're still in joshua within those walls and the breaking of those seals there was a woman by the name of rahab who had to be redeemed there was a people come on amen right in the middle of the opening of the seals that were going to be redeemed two spies that went over the city and got this gentile woman under the token hallelujah under the token of the scarlet robe and this woman was redeemed as the seals was broken hallelujah and she had been a harlot hallelujah but now when the city falls all of her lovers are dead [Applause] all her past lovers are dead oh you can't marry an israelite you were a harlot where are my accusers where are my accusers my accusers were not dead hallelujah you were justified you were sanctified your name was in the book of life before the foundation of the world and he couldn't leave in sin hallelujah hallelujah she had been a harlot she had lived in sin but now she's washed by the washing of the water by the word and the seals breaks in off of her life and her accusers are dead all her lovers are dead did you notice rahab could not bring seed from the old men of her past as hard as we tried to be a good baptist or methodist or presbyterian or catholic
