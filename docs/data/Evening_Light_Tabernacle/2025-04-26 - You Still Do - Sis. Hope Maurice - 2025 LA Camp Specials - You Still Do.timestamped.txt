[0:01] [Music]
[0:08] Well, I
[0:09] [Music]
[0:11] remember when I danced at the altar. I
[0:16] don't care if it cost me a friend or
[0:21] two.
[0:24] I
[0:27] remember getting baptized in cold water,
[0:32] then rising with the fire in my
[0:38] soul. Same
[0:40] power now and forever. No, you're not
[0:45] through. Same words can speak to the
[0:49] mountains and make them move. I know the
[0:56] God of the old is the God of the new. I
[1:01] know that you did it then and you still
[1:06] do.
[1:10] Do do you
[1:14] remember the roar of the choir as they
[1:19] praise him for hours and he'll fill the
[1:24] room? Well, I
[1:28] remember when they told her she had
[1:32] cancer and we didn't have the answer.
[1:36] the word through you
[1:39] too. Same
[1:41] power now and forever. No more not
[1:46] through. Same words can speak to the
[1:50] mountains and make them move. I know the
[1:56] God of the old is the God of the new. I
[2:02] know that you did it then and you
[2:08] still mighty and strong, faithful and
[2:12] true. You'll make a way cuz that's just
[2:15] what you do. You're the breaker of chain
[2:18] beginning and end. I'll sing it over and
[2:22] know we're the same.
[2:27] power now and forever. You're not
[2:32] through. Say words can speak to the
[2:37] mountains and make them move. I know the
[2:43] God of the old is the light of the new.
[2:48] I know that you did it in and you still
[2:54] do the same
[2:56] power now and forever. No, you're
[3:01] not. Same words can speak to the
[3:05] mountains and make them new. I know the
[3:11] God of the old is the God of the new. I
[3:16] know that you did it then and you still
[3:22] do.
[3:23] Still do.
[3:26] [Music]
[3:26] [Applause]
