the liberal we look to him today expecting him to move because he promised he would not because we're worthy not because we're good because he said he would amen where two or more are gathered i'll be there in the midst and i believe he's in our midst today so let's speak to him through the word today and may he speak to you through the word father in the name of jesus that we come it's the name that is above all names how we love you today we thank you lord that you have redeemed us forgiven us cleansed us from sin purged us made us white as snow healed us of our diseases saved us when we

of darkness will see a great light lord that you'll just illuminate us in your presence may none of us go out of here unless we're changed a little closer to you from glory to glory as we view the word as we look clearly into the promises lord mayo god you step out of the pages of this book called the bible step out of it walk here among us reveal yourself lord in a real and living way heal and deliver your children father we're looking to you but we know we come in your name and at the name of jesus every knee has to bow and every tongue confess we know when we speak that name and we pray these prayers demons scatter they cannot stand in the presence of the mighty name of jesus for at the mention of that name they have to bow and fall and no he's lord he has dominion over everest every disease sickness troubled problem that there could be [Music] what's so wonderful about it lord you are now our king you may come king one day reign in the millennium and us with you upon your throne

the inside let's just worship the lord together just for a moment before we turn to the word well it's jesus on the inside working on the outside oh what a change in my life it's jesus on the inside

[Music] [Applause] oh [Music] amen praise the lord amen will you turn with me to john chapter 14 and verse 12 for our scripture reading this morning and as we as we read this you will notice that it speaks singular to he that believeth on me but brother branham tells us clearly in christ the mystery that it's just not one person is speaking to it's talking to the entire bride of jesus christ so verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than thee shall he do because i go to my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that i will do that the father may be glorified in the son if you ask anything in my name i will do it if you love me keep my commandments and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth in the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you see me because i live ye shall live also what wonderful words of life that is you can be seated god willing after the service today brother timothy and i will be traveling going down to um first to destin florida um brother joe winters and his marion sister becky weeb and uh they're having a little wedding down there actually they have been um she's canadian so they they've already done the legal part of the ceremony but we will be doing the uh religious side as if you want to call that that way down there in destin and we'll move on from there down to brother danny stevens and uh it's their church anniversary meetings and so brother timothy and i'll be ministering there this next weekend and uh while we're away you've got we are away you've got wonderful ministry here brother joe and brother but aaron will be ministering to you so you will be tremendously blessed i know amen so um you know i i i just as i reminisce for a moment going back uh maybe four or five years ago now i i met um a little little sister anderson down there and she said brother tim said i've been wanting to see you again said i i met you many many years ago back in the well it was in the 70s and said i wanted i want to share with you a testimony she was the the wife of a pastor and he's already gone on to be with the lord but she said i wonder i want to share with you a testimony he said i was i was a little girl and uh was only uh four years old four to five years old and um i uh had been taken to the doctors by my parents because um i i just you know didn't was very handicapped and and i did not have uh my my mind i just had very little brain function was severely and um she um she said that as uh when she went uh to the doctor the doctor told her said of course this was back in then they must have been the 1940s um late 40s that um you know where she uh was taken to the doctor and she said um um the doctor said you know there's no no hope medically there is absolutely no hope for for this little girl we can't do anything for her and you know there's many things that are still out of the reach of modern medicine right amen they they have no solution for it but anyway in this situation um they had told him that there was just really no hope medically so he the the doctor said um if i were you i would find somebody who believed in prayer and i would take her to what he said i would take her to some pentecostal somewhere and let them lay hands on her and pray for her and and um so the parents said well we are pentecostal and we we certainly will take our child for prayer well they heard over in the quincy louisiana which is kind of close to the where we had the youth camp down into ritter said down into quincy louisiana we have heard that that there is a prophet of god william branham who is um preaching meetings down there and holding divine healing services so they took the the little girl to the meetings and as they went there and they went through the prayer line and brother branham prayed for her and she was completely and totally healed the retardation gone restored completely and served as a pastor's wife for many years and you know god's still god and he's not just god of the past amen i brought you even to present tense to our age but listen it didn't die with the prophet of god amen when brother branham died jesus didn't die he died two thousand years ago and he rose again and come to show us and prove to us his resurrection power so god is still god and he is able to do exceeding abundantly above that which we're able to think or ask now let's go to romans chapter 8 and verse 11 as we look into the scripture romans 8 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you how many believe you have that spirit then he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken or make alive your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you so we have a promise those of us who possess his holy spirit in our life that he will quicken our mortal bodies by his spirit and and of course there are many many quickenings of the spirit there will be quickenings from sin and to and to life there be quickening from sickness and to health there is quickening of course for the resurrection because i believe when you receive the holy ghost it is god's claim on your body for the resurrection now then i turn to philippians chapter 3 and verse 7 as we read this together but what things were gain to me i counted loss for christ yea doubtless and i count all things but lost for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i've suffered the loss of all things and to count them but dung that i may win christ and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through faith the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith and then he says these notable words that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his suffering being made conformable unto his death so today we're going to be speaking about resurrection power in a resurrected people now paul said these words that i might know him and he also said these words that if um the spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised christ from the dead shall also make alive your mortal bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in you and then jesus said these wonderful words that yet a little while the world will see me no more but you will see me because i live you live also so he promised that the church would continue to see him even though physically he wouldn't be with us but he would be with us in it by by the spirit of god not leaving us comfortless so as we as we know and speak and we walk in the resurrection power sin loses its hold on us and sickness and disease must leave resurrection power is the spirit of god it is the life of god and and we will not be defeated by anything in this life you need to you need to write that down we will not be defeated by anything in this life amen the resurrection of jesus shows us that the greatest power is god's power and nothing can overcome it and so as i speak today we know the world is rocking now with the news of a new baron of the covet viruses this gorgeous south african travel bans are put there and governments of the nations tried to stop it and our vaccines are now considered ineffected or at least thought ineffective and and more death is coming because we are on the eve of the tribulation we can already feel the hot winds blowing we see the clouds coming in we see darkness coming upon our nation upon our world and in our families remember you know it's it's like in revelation 9 where that where where that um that hell is opened up and the smoke from the from that place comes and and to the earth and blocks the light of the sun and we're we're seeing the darkness coming that is blocking the light of the son of god off of so many lives today all from our nation we just stopped for a moment for thanksgiving but i wonder i wonder how many real believers that there are even left in the world today you know people are giving you know a lip service to thanksgiving but really you know is there is a real reality where they can say that i know him that i know him that i have experienced him that i i know who he is i've made it myself but here we are it's on the eve of tribulation and as i said the smoke permeating like smoke does it's it it it saturates every fiber of humanity it gets into every crack in and corner of humanity it's in our schools it's in our colleges it's in the fabric of of home life it's everywhere that it's getting in there and i'll tell you what as that death angel comes in you gotta have a token the holy ghost it must be applied to your life and this cannot be just as a cliche that we use i've got to talk and you must possess the holy ghost in your life and apply them in every situation plague's coming modern science will curse and they'll curse god because there's nothing they can do now paul says that i might know him it's a very important thing especially in this hour it was imported in every hour but now we're coming down to the end not merely know about him but to know him in the power of his resurrection when when a person is healed that's the power of the resurrection when a person is saved that is resurrection power at work and that's what this church must have in this hour because not only did jesus need a resurrection to prove his claims just think of it he said i lay my life down and i'll raise it up again destroy this temple i'll raise it up in three days you know he made claims but had he not raised and all of his claims would have proved how falsely he was amen so he had to have the resurrection to prove that he was really the lord over the dead the lord over hell the lord over the amen every demon power that there was because he had to prove he was truly lord ruler and the resurrection proved his claims but you know it's not just jesus that needs a resurrection the church needs the resurrection you see as brother branham said it in the easter seal and see in the hour that we're living in we need an easter egg in the church resurrection we need a resurrection listen now to power faith a resurrection to power faith notice amen men and women to stand out for what god for that which is god's vindicated word so we need a resurrection to power faith because for far too many faith is dead so how do you know it's dead what faith without works is dead and the works have ceased with too many amen when they should be doing the works of jesus the works have ceased amen so their faith is dead and it is but it is not a time to be faithless this hour calls for resurrection and rapture in faith brother branham said in the evening messenger he said bring back the church to the word now what is this messenger of malachi for to do restore back the original faith the resurrection faith amen that they see jesus after he was raised from the dead seen him working among them it must restore resurrection faith you see as i said it's a time of great trouble upon the earth it's a time of diseases and viruses that mutate and come again and again it's the scourge of the world and it's unstoppable and uncontrollable you get one vaccine you got to have another you get that one you got to have another booster and you get that one and they want another booster and and because it's unstoppable and uncontrollable new ones now coming that vaccines have no defense against so you can see already the winds and and you can tell the signs of the oncoming judgment we are closer than we've ever been but i want to just remind you there's something else that is coming hallelujah amen is something else that is coming besides besides tribulation and viruses and and and terrible diseases and plagues there's something else that is coming as brother adam would say in the token i'm looking for a time of a break forth of the spirit of god in these last days that we're now in it for another surge of the holy spirit into the church for a rapture and faith just before it comes hallelujah amen so not only can we feel that wind blowing but there's another wind blowing i can feel a bit of mighty wind blowing amen and it's moving through our lives it's turning our lives and our hearts around everything somebody rushing well as he pours out his spirit upon his church [Applause] and i believe we're now at the time that the word should have preeminence i believe it's time to lay aside our creeds and our thoughts and come back to the word come back to the word not to a dead creed but a word with resurrection power with anointing with life amen something that is more than mechanics mechanics brother branham said doesn't run the automobile it's the dynamic that runs it mechanics don't run the church it's the dynamics the holy ghost gets into that that gets into this word is not a seminary oh god i think of how you know for you for now it seemed like almost 50 years we have educated ourselves into the message we have made seminary and lectures and ministers instead of being preachers you know what makes a preacher signs following when you preach amen he demonstrates the power of god and we have become lecturers educated in the message are you with me amen discerning all our theology and greek interpretation but he said it's the dynamics of the holy ghost and there to set that of fire and bring it to pass and to make it live just exactly what the word promised for is for this hour not the mechanics the dynamics it takes the mechanics and dynamics the word and the spirit they are the one that gives life can be one without the other it seemed like we went down through times you know where it's like clipping the wings of a chicken you clip one wing and he just flops around he can never get over the fence so we'll clip off the dynamics and favor the mechanics or we'll clip off the mechanics and favor the dynamics it takes both it takes both spirit and in truth it takes a balanced walk one can't be out of balance are you with me amen you can't just get on the emotional side and there's no life to go with it amen you can't just get over on the word word word side and there's there's no joy there's no emotion there's no no no enthusiasm there's no come on somebody hey man you know what i'm talking about i'm talking about dynamics and i'm talking about what brother branham talked about the stimulation of revelation we get so revelated we call it but our wine ain't got any stimulation in it amen he's done lost his fears lost to juice what we have ought to make us happy it ought to make us rejoice in ought to make you want to shout hey man you say brother tim but you know where we're studious with our with our horn and glasses on and we we've got it all down and you know we're we're we're nerdy message believers and the word laying there without life in it now i want to just remind you that this end time requires more of the holy ghost not less amen the dynamic the dynamics of this church brother brandon said will be a refilling of the holy ghost that we have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when that head and body unites together the full power of the holy ghost would raise her up just exactly like that even the dead that's dead in christ for hundreds of years will rise in the beauty of his holiness and take a flight to disguise the dynamics is the holy spirit again brother bradham talks about this and world falling apart that he spoke right here in shreveport i more than likely was there i was a little bit younger then and don't remember particular this service but nevertheless you know it it's his promise for this hour we look in the bible we see it everywhere through the bible anointed ones come and make that word live again let's stop just for a moment anointed one said well brother tim we don't want to be these anointed ones at the end time yes we do yes we do the anointings never sent for the terror they just happen to be in the same field and because they're shouting we can't shout because they're rejoicing and get moisturized by the rain we can't rejoice what do you mean it was for us the rain was not set for the unbeliever it was not sent for the tares the raid was sent for the wheat and it ought to make the wheat raise their hands up and say hallelujah thank you jesus this is what happened when the seals were opened to john he didn't sit there with his horn round glasses on and say i've got more understanding now than you do and then something more to argue about and fuss about and fuss with remember what was it he said when i saw the lamb had taken my place and brother paid my debt and opened the book i couldn't take hey man it was an intercessor for me everything heard me shouting praising god [Applause] it ought to make you want to shout anointed ones come on and make that word live again right in the hour for that hour and we've got the messiah this is him the word in the beginning was the word the lord was with god the word was god and the word remains god hebrews 13 8 the same yesterday today and forever we know what's supposed to take place in this day we're wanting a messiah and god gave us the messiah his promised word to anoint it and to make it live again yes sir real messiah it's the word of god and both heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away said jesus so what is the word waiting for he said it's waiting for somebody i don't believe that's just one person don't try to make another messiah don't make her your favorite preacher the messiah that's going to do it you know we've we've already had the apostle and we've already had the teacher and we've all had all of these and these are all greater than even the prophet god sent and they made messiahs at them and had their little camps and their little groups that followed and rallied around their messiah and what it bring another little denomination amen another death camp are you with me amen but but let me tell you something here the word is waiting for somebody can we be one of those somebodies amen somebody with faith to anoint it and to make it live again hallelujah now again three kinds of believers and i read this quote last sunday and i'm not having to mention i know what i did but the reason i believe that when the bride is called out and elected and said in the book of life there will come a sound from heaven that it takes such a baptism of the holy spirit into that bride that had taken from the earth in a rapture and grace god promised it now a sound from heaven that it takes such a baptism of the holy spirit into that bride then that should be the inoculation we're looking for not from some something by j and j or something from pfizer or whoever else remember the real inoculation amen that'll inoculate to you from unbelief that's sin that's a lot worse disease than coveted are you with me amen but now brother branham tells us it's the same holy spirit that saved the lutherans now they were justified you know that sanctified the methodists that baptized the pentecostals is sitting in order the coming of the lord jesus when it will be so powerful that that body will that body will come into this group of church that would draw the rest of them from the grave there will be a resurrection what the holy ghost is for hallelujah that's why we need him in this hour to be so powerful amen that that it will come in this group of church that would draw the rest of them hallelujah can you imagine something that comes so powerful in the living those that are alive and remain it'll draw the rest of them from the grave hallelujah a people then with resurrection life with a resurrection power in them question answers on the holy ghost jesus said say to this mountain you've heard about what's been taking place that's the ministry we're entering into we're way up the road now soon to come into the lord jesus and we've got to have rapture and faith in that church that can be changed in a moment a twinkling of an eye to go out or will not go but don't worry oh i love this it'll be there hallelujah don't worry it'll be there amen and when the power of this church rises it'll bring its brethren and the power of that church rises will bring its brethren and the power of that church will bring the other brethren and there'll be a general resurrection hallelujah the power in this church rising don't look for less power look for more power resurrection power hallelujah amen now in the message paragraphs brother branham said for me to live is christ hallelujah i believe the same god that fell on the day of pentecost upon his church as a pillar of fire divided himself with cloven tongues among his people is here tonight it's the same god and he was then he is today with the same holy ghost i know it's a paradox it cannot be explained emotions screaming crying and so forth cannot be explained but it is a paradox how god does it it's the unseen god dwelling in the human heart making himself visible by vindicating his word that he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah now what wonderful words are that look at what's promised look at what is happening because i can just tell you it's not something that is in the future amen it's something that's already present hallelujah i mean come on we look over here and we can see the plagues coming and when you see some of them already present pre-tribulation plagues coming up on the earth can't you see all of that well then what about the believers they ought to be able to see more than the demon powers that are spreading out they ought to see the life of life amen is here among us jesus christ who is alive who's not dead but alive i love this quote here because brother branham speaks about it in god's covenant with abraham and his seed he said jesus constantly was fear not fear not remember we've been reading revelation chapter 1 for the last couple of services i didn't read it this morning but i'm still preaching on it fooled you didn't i fear not that was the words that he said to john fear not amen i like what he said in the church age book he said i have not come to bring you i have not come to bring you fear and failure but i have come to bring you love and courage and ability hallelujah fear not i am with you always to the end of the world didn't we just read that i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you fear not and the christian keeps sitting back oh i just wonder oh my he said turn loose get all the things away from you and say mr satan you are defeated jesus christ stripped you of every power you had when he died at calvary and you're nothing but a bluff and you can't bluff me amen i'm made out of that stuff that don't bluff that's what come from calvary hallelujah don't bluff it go receive it amen how many can say this morning you've been made out of stuff that won't bluff you've received a word you've received a promise you've received an experience you've received the indwelling christ you know him and because you know him because he's appeared to you hallelujah don't you know church we're right here in the emmaus walk again and he's walking among his church even now jesus christ showing himself the same yesterday today and don't you know the emmaus walk is going on and he's walking along with you and he's expounding the scriptures and he says but that was me there in moses and that was me back there in elijah and that was me back there in jeremiah and that was me are you with me amen that was me all the way down through that was me i was there and he opens up the scripture and opens up their understanding and makes them know i've never left you i'm right here i'm not dead i'm the risen christ hallelujah i'm the same yesterday today or forever amen i won't fail i didn't fail back deal i won't tell you now amen it's similar swap where he's revealing himself stepping out of your shadows walking down along with you and showing you he's christ the same why he got to have a people in this day that's made out of different stuff stuff that won't bluff but oh there is a church that is bluffing they pretend to be the bride of christ remember that's how the antichrist started his ride he was on a white horse pretending pretending impersonating christ i think today you know there's a lot of pretension going on you don't we'll pretend he comes down when we push play and we pretend we turn the ministry or the the message over to brother branham and we pretend that he's serving us communion and we put prayer close in front of the of the speakers and we pretend that he's praying over the prayer class and we turned the whole thing into pretension too many are just pretending to be christians pretending to really believe and they're bluffing that's why the antichrist come out he come out with a blow and no arrows he had a claim you know and he had a profession but he had nothing to go with it as he said in the first seal he's a bluff he has no power you say the power of the church he said where's it at i'm just quoting your prophet what do they do we're the original church the original church cast out devils it healed the sick it raised the dead it saw visions and everything else words of that now see he's a bluff a bow with no arrow and that's exactly the pretentious that that we we've come down to around the message we're presenting a christ who has no arrows he did it 50 years ago he did it in the past but he don't do that today you see that was only for his ministry john 14 12 was only for william branham you see um you know we're not to have divine healings we we shouldn't have prayer lines there shouldn't even be altar calls anymore you see what is it we we want to we're presenting a christ that has a bow but no arrow and that's not jesus that's the antichrist amen because the real jesus don't just have a bow come on hallelujah there's a sword comes out of his mouth when he speaks demons flee amen when he uses the word amen there are healings there are deliverance there's salvation in the rising of the sun brother bradham tells us the very message of the gospel itself and let me remind you about the gospel i want you to remember about the gospel just for a moment let me deviate just a second because it is only until this age that we've come back to the pure gospel of christ jesus said this gospel not the methodist gospel the presbyterian gospel and but this gospel must be preached preaching all the world and then the end shall come now the message of the gospel then has not returned until this day when god turned us back to the original faith well we got things that old paul didn't have you better not certainly we understand the symbols in the book of revelation the book of revelation wasn't written until paul left after he was gone then the book of revelation was written paul didn't know the book of revelation he didn't need to know it it wasn't sealed to him the book was not sealed to him it was the antichrist spirit to come forth to begin to close the book on the promises and on the truths of the word and begin to seal it up amen but you see it's in this day there's been a clearing of the deed hallelujah amen in the debts and the liens that was against us a false doctrine has been lifted off the church amen that's why we can take a rapture luther couldn't take a rapture because you see the accuser could say but you got my baptism a trinitarian baptism but you've still got my catechism you see wesley couldn't take a rapture same thing come on zoos the street couldn't take a rapture the same thing but you're living in a day and hour where the lamb has taken the book and he's loosed the seals and he's opened up the title deed of redemption to make you the people of the book this is your land and in this land here it's defining here this is the land this is our borders from genesis to revelation amen do you know that's from eden to eden if you ever looked at it do you realize that it starts out with eden and it ends with eden and i john saw the new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven amen he will bring heaven back down on the earth and god again will dwell with his people and walk with man again come on somebody amen everything in between is a story of redemption but brother we can look with our eyes set on the end hallelujah there's coming a day where heaven will come back down upon earth it was lifted back when sin entered into eden and god said you can't live here and he closed eden's gates and the entrance to there was forbidden to man but we're coming back to his entrance again hallelujah makes me want to shout hallelujah thank you jesus amen your plan of redemption the very message of the gospel itself is to prove to the people that he's risen go tell my disciples i'm risen from the dead i'll meet with them to confirm this to them oh god how in this last day there shall be light again across the earth and i'll prove to my disciples go tell them i'm not dead i'm not a tradition i'm a living christ i'll meet them take this message to my disciples that i'm risen from the dead that's our message today they tried to seal him in a baptist tomb in a methodist tomb in a pentecostal tomb remember the seals were broken off of it come on somebody and then he raised their showing he's christ alive the same yesterday today and forever that's the good news of the gospel that's what's going to be preached you say is that right hebrews 13 8 said he's the same yesterday today and forever we his beneficiaries are to prove his life is in us [Music] now the beneficiaries of this life notice we are to prove his life is in us the life there was never a life like it lived like it he was the son of god and he died and that shut it out but when he raised again from the dead on easter morning then we as his servants are commissioned by him to go into all the world and bring this good news to every person that he's a living and how can we do it by word only see that's what we've tried to do too much of our mission work has been just changing their philosophy showing them you know some mysteries that's been revealed and then go baptize them in the name of jesus christ that's a good step it'll get you as far as the tribulation are you with me amen you've got to have the token to get out of here the holy ghost must come amen it it is more than just believing the message that is baptist theology we have treated you you know we we have been so afraid of pentecost and they're pushing you to some gift or tongues or or emotion or whatever else until we went all the way the other way until we become baptists [Applause] lutherans just say i believe jesus my savior okay you're saved we believe when you in the words of joel osteen we believe when you prayed that simple prayer lord jesus come into my life forgive me of my sins i accept you as lord and my savior okay now everybody clap your hands because we believe when you did that you were born again he wasn't born again that's not the new birth that that that is that is just the first stages of justification where you confess that he's your lord and you confess and ask forgiveness of sin that's justification you ain't incentified amen you got a lot of them justified people that are still smoking drinking drugs everything else and you know well one day you know you're going to just grow out of it you won't grow out of it hey man it's it's got listen you gotta die to sin in order for there to be a new birth you've got to die to sin people want to come along even in the message and say well you know yeah i know i got drunk last week but you know hey uh you know i didn't lose the holy ghost no you didn't lose it because you never had it i promise you you didn't lose nothing i mean you never got anything you ever god said the holy ghost in your life no more drinking anymore amen sin is dead as midnight come on church your old lust devil is dealt with your pornography is out the window it's never returning again you are walking in victory when the spirit of god comes into you i'll give you a new heart and a new spirit and i'll put my spirit in you and i'll cause you to walk in my statute and do them people want to live filthy lives and claim the holy ghost you're not you don't have the holy ghost that's a filthy spirit not the holy spirit amen amen let me repeat it again god does not come to save you in your sins but from your sins now that makes people uncomfortable it needs to what are you going to do when we stand there at rapture day and you're left behind amen you don't have a ticket a token and some preacher has preached you happy satisfied just to warm up you of a message church and you belong to the clique and the clown and you can recite the creeds and says well i believe this and i believe that i believe god sent a prophet so does the devil he knows it so i believe god is one well the devil does too and he trembles amen you don't have to convince the devil of serpent seed he's the one that did it come on amen well you know you you hey you got there you've got as far as the devil gets go a little further get sanctified get them more habits out let's see them be burned out of your life be filled with the spirit hallelujah [Applause] how can we do it by word only for it's written the gospel came not by word only but through the power and the manifestation of the holy spirit to prove that he's alive you see what we have today is another gospel jesus or actually paul would be the one to say that there would be one who would come that would so impersonate christ that he would sit in the temple of god and proclaim himself as he was as if he was god and so you see in the beginning god created man in the last day men are creating their own god so you know you have a catholic god who has to mind his mother right the catholics have their own god they got their own jesus they made a jesus that has to mind mama so if you really want something from him don't talk to him because you know he's got this hard heart you know and he's not going to listen but if you can get his mother to listen to you she can appeal to the heart of jesus who will appeal to the heart of the father and i don't know who he appeals to and father is really delinquent he's really don't really care about you it's the heart of mary who gets the heart of the son who really cared about you who and somehow another but the baptists have their own methodists have their own their halls of theologies have crafted their own jesus and paul told us that there would come this fallen away and he and he said actually that god would be worshipped or this satan would be worshiped as god but in the last day the mask would be taken off of him and we would see who it really was that people are worshiping amen now so as you if you look at it just for a moment i want you to understand you see where it's they've turned another gospel and if we're not careful in this message we'll make another jesus in fact if you're not careful you make brother branham jesus or equal to him or you'll demote jesus until he's just another man and really you know he ain't no different from any of us and just our elder brother and what kind of spirit is in this that was once to try to attack this message that would try to make brother branham god and jesus less than god if there's another gospel as paul spoke to one of the groups i'm so surprised you have turned to another gospel which there is no other but a make belief to a denominational fiction churning from that good news and because i live you live also and i live in you and the works that i do john 14 12 the works that i do will identify myself in you what a message no wonder we had a dark world of theology but in the evening time there shall be light again there is a resurrection in the evening time did somebody hear that amen it shall be lied in the evening time and the very essence of the of the message that was sent is that he has risen from the dead and we his beneficiaries we who share the resurrection with him draw benefits from this by proving to the world that he is alive we cannot do it by word only we cannot do it by some tradition of man we only reflect exactly what we are pointing to and i'm afraid today that too many of us are not getting people to christ we're getting them to a church to a theory but we must listen here we must get them to christ he's the only one and the only one that has life he that has the son has life and if the life of a dead a man that's dead and being projected in you you'll live the same life he lived if the blood there was a certain type you took that blood from a man change the blood from one man to another you'd absolutely be that type blood and if your spirit that's in you is wrecking dead and you're anointed with the light that was in christ is upon you romans 8 11 if the spirit that raised christ from the dead dwells in you it will also quicken your mortal body that same life them same powers and same benefits that he had here on earth from god he redeemed you a seed that was foreknown by god whose names was put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world hallelujah so i'm going to announce today there has to be a bride who are the people of the resurrection who are prepared amen to meet the bridegroom god has left it for this last age for there to come a bride without a spot or wrinkle or blemish that he can present to himself not an immature girl like in the days of luther not a preteen like in the days of wesley that's why this is bride time this is time when she puts on the full word and walks down the aisle becomes one with him takes on his name somebody help me preach amen not a not a not a teeny bopper like the like the azusa movement infatuated and dazzled with gifts and not the giver come on but a mature elect lady ready and willing to take on his name one who has his identity there's a people of the resurrection who have received a name change hallelujah you know at a wedding there is a name of change the girl completes her name as for the last time saying in a paper where she becomes in union with a husband and she signs her name that way the last time let's say you're one of these modern females which reflect in the modern church that won't take on his name right amen because as as a modern female don't want the name or she wants to keep her own name she wants her own identity we've got the pentecostal people today he said too many rickey's too many elvises that word elvis and ricky you never heard of that in other days it's a word it's the name for this day it goes with it it means something say a name means nothing then why did he change abram's name to abraham what he changed saul's name to paul simon's name to peter why did he change his own name why did he change jacob to israel not until he wrestled with the lord not until he overcome and when jesus overcome death hell in the grave the bible said he had a new name and when jacob overcome now listen and if the church can overcome she will stop saying a methodist baptist and presbyterian hallelujah you see you see we must stop saying that because these are defined and the bible as blasphemous names or names of blasphemy because to be listen to me now to be called anything besides the name of your bridegroom is the mark of a headless rebellious woman can i say it plainly oh harlot and brother branham said when she can overcome her creeds and the world that's drawn into there she'll come back to being the bride of jesus christ miss jesus christ hallelujah hey man we've done the same thing around oh i'm two souls i'm perusing i i tell you we we're seven thunderers we're well listen church you've got to die to that name amen when you overcome you will die to that name and overcome the creeds that that throw her in there and come back to the bride of jesus christ miss jesus christ miss jesus mistress jesus wife amen amen see church we we we are actually in a day we're excellent today and i don't want to make a doctrine out of this because we can say we're the bride of christ that's fine but we're actually because a man's wife is always his bride remember we've actually transitioned beyond that amen we are the lamb's wife a bride has a certain right she has a certain certain ring she has certain identities she is a bright elect but when she becomes a wife she becomes coheir with him amen when they get married he takes on her debt amen amen hallelujah aren't you glad i owe the debt i could not pay he paid the debt he didn't know i needed someone to wash my sins away amen and when he took me as his bride and mother claimed me as his wife he paid every day of mine and i'm free [Music] not only sin that but the unbelief death of seven ages piled up from misconceptions of ages past liens that the devil had against us he took the book and did a title search and searched it all the way back to the beginning tell me what age tell me what day that could tell us who the seven stars of revelation are amen tell me what other age could say these are more than cities there these are ages and here's the spirits that dominated them and here's where we are in the last age hallelujah amen you see the there again we we're people who have come within to marriage rights whatever he owns we own whatever we bind he binds whatever we lose he loses we are become his representation we are not truly another person we have been made one with him though we don't lose our individuality we still have been made one and connected with another we are no longer single we are one we do not act independently we act as one now these people who are the resurrected out of sin and recreated as they are recreated as a new creation out of the decay of sin and death resurrected into a new life there is no smell of death upon them there is no creed no smell of a creed no smell of a dogma somebody help me preach now i i want you to understand to to know jesus that i may know him said you know it's impossible to understand his ministry and who he is without understanding the the larger view of redemption sweeping salvage plan you see his miracles that are wrought today are the same miracles as he wrote back there amen they are miracles of restoration restoration to health restoration to life restoration to freedom from demonic possession amen jesus miracles are 2 000 years ago and his miracles today provide us with we it provides us with the meaning that they're just samples of of them of his of his redemption power amen freeing a creation from shackles of sin amen sickness from evil from and and a reinstatement of her being the bride that she was at pentecost [Music] so the resurrection is a re-introduction that's also what resurrection means re-introduction of a bride without spot or wrinkle or blemish a virgin bride they are pure without spot they walk with him in white and they are worthy amen it's the bride of the book of acts reintroduced come on church you see this bride of this last day she has not only been seen in review but she's been seen in preview hallelujah you you see again that that's exactly what it means to take the title is to review all the transitions from the original owner and you review every one of them and then the debts that was incurred uh during the time they all had to be paid and reconciled i'm so glad we had a prophet in this day and hour who did it through the holy spirit of title search listen george if he could go back in your life 50 years he could go all the way back to the days of paul irenaeus martin luther wesley come on to azusa street he can go right back to all of them and search the title amen okay i see right here now here it was handed down to this age from wesley and this now with this handed down from wesley it was handed from luther and from luther is another messenger and that was columba or and then and then there was martin and ireneus and then paul and here's where it started out the church the original owner now coming back and now we've got to clear all the deed so all the debt is paid yes because it's rapture time will remind you when i started a series on the people of the book i started out with with the discovery of of the um the actual discovery of uh of the the scrolls the dead sea scrolls were a little simple shepherd boy took a stone and threw it down into a dark cave and he heard something break and he went down to investigate and he comes back out with the books of isaiah the books of the prophets the sacred scrolls this was 1948 the same time that israel became a nation and it would now give proof amen they would give proof this book once it had been brought to light once it had been unsealed come on church once it had been brought to light and unsealed it proved through the world that israel was headed first they were there before the palestinians they were there before the arabs they were there before the english they were there before any other nation amen the book gave them the right to the land don't you know what god has given in this day he gave you the right to every divine promise right to healing right to miracles right to salvation right to the baptism of the holy ghost right to true doctrine why a little shepherd boy a little kentucky almost up but better when you know coming down little ignorant boy took him through the rock of revelation down into the dark cloisters that has been his word hidden in darkness for 2 000 years and the seals were broke hallelujah we heard the noise of the thunder amen and that thunder there was the voice of god speaking out amen and the book is no longer closed it's an open book amen it's open and then there is mine here and there is my land and the devil ain't taking one bit of my land away i will have healing i will have miracles i will have oh hallelujah through salvation i will have every divine promise of god i no longer have to walk in darkness amen because the light of light is here [Applause] hallelujah glory hallelujah hallelujah we've been both seen in review and preview he saw the review of the original bride i don't know about you but this is even better than bill dow going down i'll meet you at the blue board restaurant gasping his last breath under a tent 90 something years old see god can still heal you when you're 90. you live again for many more years healthy amen as a 92 year old can be we shouldn't give up on any divine promise it's for the old it's for the young it's for the middle age it's for all of us when israel left egypt it wasn't just the young people that went that's right oh grandma oh grandma laying on the cot drawing her last breath right she was getting ready to leave uh how am i gonna go i don't know granny maybe we can take a maybe we can take a a and and make a cot maybe you know your two biggest grandsons can take and the other grandsons can trade out and we'll do it no no god provided a lamb go and eat the lamb this is your communion here's your passover amen apply the blood eat the lamb come on amen drink a little of that wine with that communion amen you're going to be leaving here amen and what did she do little granny got over there well i i don't know boys i tell you what you know i you watch some of these old people sometimes in a birthday party and they go to blow their uh their

that mmm well i'll tell you i feel that oh my goodness there says that that's that crook in my back is straightening out amen oh give me one more bite boys and out of that she comes and say i'm on my way to canaan's land amen if you don't don't don't hinder me i'm going hallelujah and i got some news for you this morning we ain't leaving a hook behind we're not leaving our children we're not leaving our grandchildren we're not leaving our mothers we're not leaving our daddy we're not leaving a hook behind we're all going we're going hallelujah i said hallelujah [Applause] don't you think god provided the lamb for us in this day yes he did he saw a review of the original bride he saw the church pardon me for a moment but he saw the church as it degraded degenerated into a horus lewd stripped naked harlot dancing to the tune of rock and roll and after that he saw the preview remember first he was given a review then he was given a preview and like i said this is more than bill dallas amen i'll meet you in front of the build from front of the blue board restaurant and shake your hand that was enough for bill dowell to get out of bed amen to me to have maybe four or five while he actually lived past the prophet he would live for all three or four more years i i i'd not even cognitive when he really passed away but he lived for four to four to five years after brother branham passed but nevertheless he saw the preview a display of the bride before she's fully revealed that's what a preview is amen it's a display of the bride before she's fully revealed or manifested so he said when this bride she was looking at me as i was standing there together her eyes she was the cleanest sweetest looking people i'd ever seen in my life oh god message people don't lose that you don't fit the vision that means when it's fulfilled you're not a part of it when you're dressing like a harlot when our girls or my clothes are melted and poured into can't move without sinning when you're when you're when your skirts are above your knees when you're standing or sitting when you gotta slid up to the gates of hell oh god amen you don't fit the vision i mean you got to fit the vision you say brother brother tim said i i said i just kind of conformed no don't conform be changed be transformed by the renewing of your mind where you look at sin the way god looks at sin like your husband looks at sin we want to streak our hair this and we can blend them there and we can just keep one step in the world and cleanest sweetest looking people i ever seen in my life looked like they could have been a dozen or more i don't know remember they're just representing it i don't know how many was the breasts but there was just a group of them and she passed by sweetly with an air her eyes up watching hello as she passed by and she was beautiful and i looked at her and she as she passed by and he says now that's the bride now we'll con we'll we shall review the churches and when they come i noticed them coming up and when they come up each one looked like got worse and i've never seen such a filthy bunch in my life and when i said next i heard a noise and here comes the american group and he said they were totally naked except for something gray that they were holding in front of them and she danced to the tune of rock and roll and when they passed by there was nothing it was totally naked and that fits the scripture revelation chapter 3 because revelation 3 to the laodicean age she is naked let me stop just for a minute that nakedness is nothing like even the nakedness that we're talking about and and there's too many that are are naked the nakedness you can see you can see there's no modesty anymore but that nakedness is nothing comparison to the nakedness of going there and hadn't appeared to god in the sinful body you sinned in are you listening to me now you don't want to try to take this body you do not want to die in the condition you're in with a body that has not been claimed for the resurrection amen because you have never known nakedness like that nakedness now i watched her this american group dancing to the tune of rock and roll and then he said i heard that real sweet music come again and here come that little bride coming again and and he says this is what comes out though and she walked by and she was exactly like the one in the first place walking to the step of the music of god's word marching on by and when i saw it i stood there with both hands up crying like that and when i come to i was standing on my porch out there looking across the field what she's got to be the same bride the same kind built out of the same kind of material that she was in the first place now read malachi 4 and see if we're not supposed to have a message in the last days that will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers back to the original pentecostal message word by word brothers we are here amen that's my announcement to you this morning brothers we are here amen the same original pentecostal message word by word you see it was this age of laodicea there would be the age that the church would return to be in the bride she was at pentecost so we know there must be an of necessity be a return of dynamic power this is what's expected you see now as in the vision of the preview of the bride the one at the beginning was reintroduced at the end now brother branham tells us and what does it take to make a christian life he said now if the church of the living god which is the pillar of truth god intended this church to be a powerful church a glorious church a church that the whole world could look upon as a bride of christ well expected in the spouse and to live in such an atmosphere and conduct itself in such a way that god would be proud of this church to present it to christ at the coming of the lord it should live in that characteristic in the church it should be living that way hallelujah think about that what he said amen a glorious church a powerful church notice as he said in the message pardon this is after the seals god hates a powerless religion it's got to be power certainly it's a power to save a man from sin it's a power that can do signs and wonders and miracles as jesus promised they zeroed in on the word of god back there and believed it and hit the target you zero the same way on the word of god it'll hit the target again it's got to because he's the same yesterday today and forever god don't like a powerless religion god does not want that god wants to perform god wants to show himself alive our very hopes is a resurrection is that right our hopes of life is a resurrection and the resurrection of jesus christ you see god wants to work in his church jesus said i'll be with you always even to the end of the world the what should i do shall you do also john 14 12. now god's relationship with his church and i'm running out of time now but let me just wind down and just get you a few points god's relationship i may cover this again but his relationship with his church is to be like a loving marriage paul likens it to marriage he says husbands love your wives ephesians 5 25 love your wives even as christ loved the church and gave himself for it that he may sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water of water by the word that he might presented to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without now we know god is love that's what god is that's his nature amen that's the essence of his great being it's a substance that determines his character that's why brother branham believed that the baptism of the holy ghost is divine love amen now love is not his evidence he told us that neither is shouting or speaking in tongues it's evidence amen but it's he that can receive the word of god not just as a creed or a dogma but as a life-changing experience that causes you to walk in his statutes and do his judgments amen now so again in contrast to the bride there is a woman who is claiming to be his queen and she's a wicked woman she has no love for him she hates what he stands for and she tries to change him into a creature of her own liking but there is a people that he said the bride will love him listen god wrote it about you pick up your pen and write this amen come on church and then god's thoughts about you the bride will love him and have his potentials she will be like him because they will be one hallelujah can't you see can i just get it just for a moment can i let let's just let's just roll down just for a moment i want to try to get down to this thought of this revelation chapter one i've been hitting that in service after service and as we as we speak at it for a moment i want to just clench the nail as we go into this but let's get this thought real clear you know that that brother what brother branham was talking about this oneness do you know when he looked at revelation 1 at this mighty one he first would see that as instead of christ it'd be being his bride in revelation 1 this mighty one this one that was said i am he that was dead but i'm alive forevermore brother branham would look at that and he said i see more than jesus standing there he said i actually see his bride amen this is from the seven church ages he said when one likened to the son of man he said what was it his bride can you imagine brother branham is looking at jesus and he sees more than jesus he sees you in there are you with me church he sees a people that are one with him amen that when that when you see her you've seen the father when you see her you see jesus because she is his living representation of him upon the earth she was covered with a with a garment down to her foot you remember we were reading it revelation 1 a man a garment down the foot he said that's the holiness of jesus christ governor amen and she was girded about uh the paps and he said with a golden girdle he said see i see a a man not a man i see a woman here the gospel that held the power and the glory of god over the body of christ that's what has he heard girded about with a golden girdle it's the gospel with power and glory of god over her body the body of christ he said i see more than jesus i see his body i see his people there revelation 1 no wonder when he said i am he that was dead but behold i am alive forevermore amen and don't just speak of the groom it speaks also of the bride because we were dead but this message brought us resurrection life oh he said his head and his hair was white like well the white is of righteousness and holiness and his eyes like flames of fire he can look right through you don't try to hide from him he knows who you are what you are what you've done he sees everything his feet were like fine brass brass also is also his judgment his feet then the church of jesus christ uh is set upon the divine judgment christ dying in our stead the just one paying for our judgments here up there before before god died there as a sinner on the cross his soul descended into hell and god not suffering his holy one to seek corruption raise him up on the third day for our justification who sits his right hand now as a high priest and can be touched with the feelings of our infirmity which i returned in like manner as he went into heaven to receive a glorious church that's made herself ready blood washed and second born amen hallelujah see amen he called him the firstborn she's second born amen he was the come on church the firstborn out from the dead amen but because i live you will live also thank you lord amen the voice of many waters his sound of his voice was the voice of many waters it was like a roar it comes roaring out of every scripture out of every prophecy out of every true minister even out of your life his voice speaks out of you are you with me amen what does the waters represent if you want to mark it down revelation 17 15 you'll find the bible the waters without source of thickness multitudes and people in tongues all right voice oh he says what a horrible thing for a drifting soul on the sea of life no pilate to guide him loose and floating with the tides to hear the roars of the great cataracts the falls what a horrible thing it would be to a soul-drifting voice of many waters what is his voice it's the judgment the voice of the ministers hallelujah my voice is in there amen i'm not the only voice in there but my voice is mixed in there your voice is in there come on church amen every son and daughter of god your voice is his voice the voice of many waters cried out thickness and multitude the voice of those seven stars in his hand every church preaching oh my goodness what we're doing preaching the baptism of the holy ghost the baptism in jesus name speaking in tongues the power of god the resurrection of christ the second coming divine judgment the voice of many waters came forth from the one that was like the son of man hallelujah brother branham said his voice christ and his church as the bride in christ being one like husband and wife as one christ in the church being molded together with one person same holy spirit hallelujah think about it we have his same spirit not another spirit the same spirit the things that christ did the church does also do you see it that beautiful church there in holiness in power in majesty with sea and visions signs wonders everything just like he did here on the earth giving all praise to god christ molded in to one amen hallelujah amen resurrecting power in a resurrected people you're not dead church after 2 000 years you've risen from the tombs sealed in a baptist tomb a catholic tomb a methodist tomb and sealed down and bound down with every kind of dogma but death couldn't hold you because you were predestinated to life you had to come forth you couldn't stay there amen you've been changed into his image until you become his voice here upon the earth and now his voice is in his people what almighty god we serve let the musicians come right now i want you to just reflect on this for a moment i want you to think about it oh you don't want to be there that day like a drifting soul out on the sea of time and your time is up here on the earth you're caught in between you can't go there and the judgment isn't yet and you can't come back to earth and you're caught a wandering spirit waiting for your time for judgment you don't think brother branham taught that go listen to present stage of my ministry listen to sermons like that i can give you some other references i think it's even in countdown there's several of them he mentions it a drifting soul you know why you didn't make an anchor here you got to make your anchor here it's got to be your anchor troubled waters are coming stabilizers are going to be on the ship brother timothy read that the other day and said here's one of my favorite quotes i can remember back in 1981 1981 in anniston alabama i was struggling to find something to preach to a little congregation of people that lost their pastor he died in a drowned in accident i went and helped bury him and then would pastor his church just is temporarily just to try to help them his intern there that morning as i struggled with what to preach god had me to preach stabilizers on the ship and there was a young hippie boy there with hair down his shoulder a shirt that wouldn't meet his belly or his pants and showed his belly button a boy who had come to church there smoking marijuana you know him vernon winters and that day in the presence of god god sanctified him he cried out to god and his wife at that time reached and grabbed him she was just a young worldly girl sister gina grabbed him and held him there and tried to comfort him but he couldn't be comforted he kept praying and crying out until god sanctified him threw his marijuana out the window as he left the church he would come and be a part of the church and even though he had his struggles in his time god would never let go of him he always would be the stabilizer that would anchor him back again and when he left from here he left here anchored but god wants to put stabilizers on your ship i've anchored my soul in the haven of rest god wants to do it for you where you become his voice will you become one with him well i don't think i don't think this about i don't think of this about it doesn't matter the message you can be saved and believe anything i don't even know what they they present jesus too they talk about jesus also [Music] it don't matter i'll keep my own identity i'll live my own life i'll do my own thing i i don't have to take his name oh yeah i can take it informally and get baptized maybe that'll make my parents happy get them off my back ah maybe i'll get a few little pats on tobacco people recognize me you see that baptizes you into the fellowship of believers but they don't baptize you into christ there's only one by one spirit we're all baptized into the body of christ baptism will baptize you into the fellowship of a local body but the baptism of the holy ghost it baptizes you into the fellowship of christ because now he is in you and you are in him [Music] wouldn't it be wonderful that somebody could look at you and see jesus well it's it's not exactly him but the way he sees acting sees his wife she just looks like the way she behaves the way she talks the way she addresses the way she loves she loves like jesus any time to have a stabilizer put on your ship we're coming into some rough waters it ain't getting better don't wait until this smoke binds your eyes [Music] because it'll get right down into that where you you just can't see and you'll be your vision will be clouded and you'll be like seeing things just like the rest of the world they'll lead you off down a path come on here come on come on come walk with me some little girl at school or some boy or this or that or some comrade at work come on come walk with me you get pulled down along the path until their real identity is shown and they're not your friends and they begin to tear you to pieces take away your virtue your holiness take away your identity as a child of god pull you down a path of unrighteousness to where you're just in pieces your ears are gone you can't hear the spirit your eyes are gone they're plucked out until you can't see what is really going on in the world darkness overtake you and they leave you like a piece of garbage on the floor because that's the way the devil does he'll use you for a moment first pleasure and trash you and leave you crumpled in a pile and every time you move he'll just pull you a little closer into the depths of despair [Music] i want to talk to you just a moment if you bow your head just with me just a moment you know your life is unstable you know you've been pulled in every direction you know exactly [Music] but you hear you hear there's an exodus you're just like a little bite of the lamb this morning maybe that bite will only get you to justification just where your sins of pastor gone but that would be a wonderful start got to start somewhere [Music] so well everybody in the church is full-fledged christian know they're justified ones there are sanctified ones there are some people just been anointed with the holy ghost and they jump and shout and ran the aisle but there are some that are really sealed to the day of redemption [Music] but i'm asking you today with the things that are coming on the land [Music] there's this push to become vaccinated and a push to be inoculated and a push all of them government decrees and oh we'll not force you and we're not and then turn around and find ways to force you and all of this and americans are standing up it's my american right i will not be vaccinated you will not push me around you got all this fight what good does it do it's all for nothing no matter whether you are end if you're not inoculated with christ i'll tell you what i've got a vaccine today that will inoculate you from sin that inoculates you and make you a real child of god change you in his presence i want to ask you if you receive that it's a divine vaccine it was a prescription given by an ancient prophet by the name of peter who gave a divine prescription that's unchangeable because god don't have to change it sin may mutate sin may come a different way sin may come and now in the way of your cell phone and pornography and all kinds of things and ways and gates is open it may change it it may have variance you may be faced with variants that other ages have never faced but this inoculation is against everything that satan could do no matter how much it mutates evolves or changes sin may get worse but this inoculation is even better for the promises unto you and to your children and to them that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall come call peter what shall we do what shall we do how can we get inoculated repent everyone you see it starts with repentance maybe if i can just get you there today if i can just get you there if we can just begin there repentance would you just lift a hand toward god say lord i need to cleanse him today i need a real purging lord i need forgiveness of my sins i really do i need forgiveness i want your forgiveness if if you just lift a hand up toward him that's a start that's right you already got your hand up you'll just raise it a little higher just read it to him say jesus you see the bible said he that calls on the name of the lord shall be saved so you call on him and you say jesus pardon me lord pardon me i want to cleanse him maybe maybe it's more than that you see but i got these symptoms of sin brother tim i got these habits i i i know they're not right and i know i gotta i gotta have the symptoms of this red disease caused sin off of my life i want to be free from it today you know that you've got to wait that so easily but section you want to say god remember me this morning remember me would you raise your hand to him remember me lord [Music] you say brother tim it can't happen like that listen listen i i can go back to a young man sitting in my meetings sitting in my meetings a chain smoker couldn't quit wanted to quit but he couldn't right in the middle of my preaching he screamed out i'm delivered i delivered i'm delivered and he never went back to smoking again gone forever you may not be a smoker but what about it what about it is there some temper is there something is there some habit is there some complex is there something you just like to yield to god right now in his presence he sees you he sees you he sees you what about you people are so confused about the baptism of the holy ghost some claim they got it and some don't know what to have and some well why don't we just go in for a real refilling of the holy ghost today why don't we just start right there and say lord i need a refilling i need a refilling i'd just like you to i just
