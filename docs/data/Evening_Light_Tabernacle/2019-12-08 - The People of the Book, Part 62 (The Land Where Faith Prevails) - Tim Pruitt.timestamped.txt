[16:59] believe we've been taught that the Lord
[17:01] Jesus keeps all of his appointments and
[17:04] if he predestinated this moment he's
[17:05] here this morning so let's treat it like
[17:08] he's here and let's give ourself away
[17:10] and give him everything let's take these
[17:13] needs before the Lord gracious Heavenly
[17:16] Father Lord that's the greatest desire
[17:18] of my heart Lord is that I could see
[17:20] more of myself laid down and laid aside
[17:22] and put aside and more of you manifested
[17:25] in my life Lord Lord I want to see less
[17:27] of me and more of you and I thought
[17:29] that's why we gather to hear your word
[17:31] Lord and allow it to changes in order to

[18:46] Jesus Lord we speak those things because
[18:49] we are believers Lord were a believer in
[18:51] the never failing Word of the Living God

[18:54] believer because you have never been
[18:56] defeated you have never once come into a
[18:58] battle father that you didn't leave
[19:00] packing the victory Lord and we were
[19:01] arrayed this morning for battle nor were

[26:52] a man will let you be seated this
[26:56] morning you know I believe every ever
[26:59] baby is a miracle
[27:01] amen I believe the life as mayor is a
[27:04] miracle
[27:05] I mean that's just waking up this
[27:06] morning as a miracle another day to live
[27:09] and but you know we have this baby here
[27:11] this morning that's the Lord's done
[27:13] really something special in our midst
[27:16] and I just like to to tell about it for
[27:18] a moment before we call for the baby
[27:21] dedication but just it was after four
[27:24] miscarriages and hemorrhage in the
[27:27] uterus at six weeks 12 weeks they
[27:30] couldn't find the heartbeat until we
[27:32] prayed 19 weeks they discovered a to
[27:35] vessel cord instead of three of course
[27:39] this could caused a lot of concern with
[27:41] doctors and also us that the baby
[27:44] wouldn't develop normally but but about
[27:47] nine and then about twenty nine weeks
[27:50] stomachs and legs was too small and so
[27:52] there's a lot of concern about that and
[27:54] the normal growth but you know right
[27:58] after the fall meetings Bethany was to
[28:00] go for another checkup and on that
[28:03] Saturday brother Ron had prayed for her
[28:05] and you know and she went back to the
[28:08] the meet the checkup there at the doctor
[28:11] and they were amazed just how quickly
[28:13] her stomach and legs and their nearly
[28:16] doubled in size and at birth you know
[28:19] she was a proportionate healthy baby and
[28:21] passed every test in her exam by the
[28:25] pediatrician that's a mighty God
[28:34] you know what the devil means for our
[28:36] harm God means for a good it just builds
[28:39] our faith that much more and this
[28:41] morning I'd like to sing maybe a
[28:43] different song that we normally sing for
[28:45] baby dedication but we just sing the
[28:47] course our God is awesome
[28:49] how many can say that this morning he
[28:52] man I like to sing it right in the face
[28:54] of every devil of Hell ever doubt her
[28:57] every spirit that would try to raise up
[28:59] and say God don't heal God don't deliver
[29:01] God don't save our God is awesome
[29:05] amen he's mighty he's a wonderful God
[29:09] amen our God is awesome
[29:14] [Music]

[29:40] also mounted
[29:48] ha

[29:57] broken straight where I've been when he
[30:01] can river

[30:13] a man and declare that he's the same
[30:16] yesterday today and forever amen what a
[30:21] wonderful thing to bring this family and
[30:24] their new little addition little Brook
[30:28] Kirsten Dexter to be dedicated to the
[30:32] Lord and this is some part of the very
[30:36] prayer that I prayed in Shiloh and we
[30:45] just see this is the first of many a man
[30:50] a man and it's also assigned to us that
[30:53] a barren church is going to give life a
[30:56] man and barren souls are gonna come to
[30:59] Christ
[31:00] a man so we certainly serve an awesome
[31:03] God here today I'm gonna ask my wife to
[31:06] join us today and also matthan Mary
[31:11] Dexter are here from from Arizona I'd
[31:14] like them to come and stand here with us
[31:17] today man is part of the family and
[31:21] extended family and we're the proud
[31:26] grandparents certainly amens the Pruitts
[31:29] and the Dexter's you know I just think
[31:32] of Michael many many years ago giving up
[31:37] his scholarships and heading out to
[31:39] Louisiana to find a place where he could
[31:45] raise his family and to be under a
[31:47] ministry that he felt that would that he
[31:50] could grow under and Michael has been a
[31:55] man of faith and of course as time went
[31:58] on he wound up marrying my daughter
[32:00] Bethany and have this wonderful family
[32:03] mother Michael is a tremendous addition
[32:07] to our church as he operates as a deacon
[32:12] the song leader technician you know a
[32:16] lot of the behind scenes that you see
[32:19] you don't understand
[32:21] that even goes on hours and hours this
[32:23] man spends - to make sure that the
[32:27] things are broadcasted around the world
[32:29] and many technical issues his dad also
[32:33] is has come over and helped us with
[32:36] sound and other Internet is used as well
[32:39] and so it's been a blessing
[32:40] so the Dexter family has blessed us
[32:43] tremendously and we're so thankful for
[32:45] them and of course we have David and
[32:48] Courtney here - that's a pardon
[32:50] Michael's brother and sister-in-law so
[32:53] you know we're a blessed people aren't
[32:56] we and then to hold this little miracle
[32:59] my god he's awesome a man to bring us
[33:04] through the valleys and through the rain
[33:06] and through difficult times and to bring
[33:09] us to this wonderful moment today and a
[33:12] little Brook um we don't have to explain
[33:16] what a brook is we all know what that is
[33:18] a small stream but Kirsten is it means a
[33:22] Christian a follower of Christ and and
[33:25] that's what our aspirations and our
[33:29] goals as for our children is that they
[33:31] would follow the Lord with all of their
[33:34] hearts a man and so may they follow in
[33:37] the footsteps of their parents and
[33:39] grandparents and follow the Lord and as
[33:42] we point them to Jesus and then as a
[33:44] congregation a church family you have
[33:47] responsibilities also of being examples
[33:50] in pointing these little ones to the
[33:53] Lord so we're are in all this together

[47:11] as I just step here for a moment Lord I
[47:16] I don't know how to explain it but I'm
[47:19] just looking Lord like a child looking
[47:22] at the swinging of the rope for that
[47:24] right moment just to jump into the
[47:26] anointing Lord and then to move with
[47:29] that anointing Lord that may it be today
[47:33] that we not just be bystanders looking
[47:36] on but ever one of us become ones that
[47:39] put our faith into action I ask God did
[47:42] you'll speak to us now I know it's lord
[47:45] the needs of your people Lord the things
[47:48] that we we deal with around the world
[47:50] Lord your precious ministry Lord and
[47:53] their burdens around the world does God
[47:56] call them men that stands for truth my
[48:00] lord they stand in their pulpits today
[48:03] without fear or favor and preach the
[48:06] unsearchable riches of Christ I pray
[48:09] Lord that you'll do it today and then
[48:12] and then our service here today anoint
[48:15] us bless those that are around the world
[48:18] Lord oh god is it reaches globally today
[48:22] into the far-reaching lands
[48:26] Lord there are many burdens are many
[48:28] situations but may God they look they
[48:32] quit looking with the eyes of their own
[48:35] understanding and begin to look with
[48:37] eyes of faith and see things from a
[48:39] different perspective today I ask it in
[48:42] the name of Jesus I know what the words
[48:45] we speak for God's glory a man a man god
[48:49] bless you we love you in the Lord good
[48:53] to be in the house of the Lord together
[48:54] numbers chapter 33 verse 53 we're going
[48:58] to read this again these words given to
[49:01] Israel and then I would like to look at
[49:05] John 15:7
[49:07] as we worship the Lord together this
[49:10] morning
[49:11] amen
[49:15] alright numbers 33 verse 53 and ye shall
[49:20] dispossessed the inhabitants of the Lamb
[49:23] and well therein for I have given you
[49:27] the land to possess it how doesn't that
[49:31] just sound wonderful
[49:32] then I would like you to turn with me to
[49:35] John chapter 15 and verse 7 and these
[49:38] are the words of our precious Lord and
[49:41] Savior Jesus Christ whom we alone
[49:45] believe in for our salvation a man John
[49:49] 15 in verse 7 if you abide in me and my
[49:54] words abide in you you shall ask what
[49:57] you will and it shall be done to you and
[49:59] hearing as my father glorified that you
[50:03] bear much fruit and so shall you be my
[50:07] disciples a man god bless you you can be
[50:10] seated hey man what a wonderful words of
[50:13] life we're gonna be speaking today on
[50:15] the end the Lamb of the lamb where faith
[50:18] prevails Amen I believe that there is a
[50:22] prevailing faith for this day you know
[50:26] and and we preach some things like this
[50:28] because we are trying to get the church
[50:31] into the place that we can really see
[50:33] apostolic times moving among us I
[50:36] believe that's what we all hunger
[50:39] or is is that and of course I believe
[50:42] we're in the our fart we see it but we
[50:45] want more of it a man and I we wanted to
[50:49] flow we wanted to flow like the little
[50:52] baby's name was Brooke we want it to be
[50:54] a flow and Brooke a man and and we
[50:58] wanted to flow and help us and flow out
[51:00] to others so this is our desire to be a
[51:05] channel for that faith that God can move
[51:08] through now when we speak about the land
[51:13] we know the the land that the Israelites
[51:16] would leave from as we could look into
[51:21] the this time was as a time of
[51:25] redemption as they were redeeming God
[51:27] was redeeming Israel from Egypt and
[51:30] bringing them back into their land of
[51:32] promise and the book of Exodus is a book
[51:37] of redemption and of course in our
[51:39] Exodus this is the the the hour of
[51:43] redemption and I believe that we're in a
[51:45] time of full redemption this is why
[51:49] seven angels would appear to the prophet
[51:52] of God because it shows completion and
[51:54] that we are we're in the hour of full
[51:57] redemption and if so Egypt would be a
[52:02] land full of unbelief and bondage and
[52:06] slavery but we have left the land of
[52:10] unbelief and we've entered into the land
[52:13] of faith a man then this is a land where
[52:16] faith prevails because without faith you
[52:20] cannot please God and so to please God
[52:24] is to of course possess the promises
[52:28] that he gave you in his word to possess
[52:31] and and of course then we read from john
[52:37] the words of our Savior where he says if
[52:41] you live in me and my
[52:42] words live in you and then you shall ask
[52:46] what you will and it shall be done and
[52:49] so again we are to bide in that land
[52:54] because it's only in that land were that
[52:57] we can be blessed that's where our
[53:00] inheritance lays our inheritance does
[53:03] not lay out of the promises of God our
[53:06] inheritance lays in the Holy Ghost in
[53:09] the Word of God and so we are to bide it
[53:13] and be blessed in the promised land
[53:15] but the land that was given to Israel
[53:18] was given to you know was subject to one
[53:21] little word yes and that Judah Romani 20
[53:25] and 28 15 it lists all the blessings
[53:29] ahead of this but then it says but it
[53:33] shall come to pass if now this is a very
[53:36] very um this is a clause in the Covenant
[53:41] if you would say in other words it makes
[53:43] it conditional on on this if and and
[53:49] this if that will not hearken to the
[53:51] voice of the LORD thy God to observe to
[53:54] you'll do all of his Commandments and
[53:56] his statutes which I command thee this
[53:59] day that all of these curses shall come
[54:02] upon thee and overtake thee so again if
[54:05] they did not observe the commandments in
[54:09] his statues and listen to the voice of
[54:12] God then all the curses that were listed
[54:16] in the book would come upon them then
[54:19] them when we look at ours you know they
[54:23] I would like you to say the word to the
[54:27] spiritual Israelites is contingent upon
[54:30] the same if now I understand when I say
[54:34] that that we have an unconditional
[54:37] covenant and it's not based on what we
[54:41] do but about what God does and so again
[54:46] but I want to look back at verse 7 of
[54:52] chapter 15 and we're going to see the
[54:54] same word here
[54:56] if you abide or if you live in me and my
[55:00] words live in you you shall ask what you
[55:05] will so again I'm though it is an
[55:10] unconditional covenant and we have no
[55:12] argument about that that yet it is
[55:16] conditional
[55:18] it is only unkissed conditional if we
[55:21] live in the land if we dwell in Christ
[55:25] and that to dwell in Christ is to be
[55:29] filled with the Holy Ghost
[55:31] so the promises of God are continued can
[55:35] you know it's required upon this one
[55:39] thing this requirement that you must
[55:40] have the Holy Spirit to dwell in this
[55:44] land and then of course then abiding in
[55:48] him and he abides in us then we ask what
[55:51] we will and it shall be given to us in
[55:55] other words the whole land and
[55:57] everything in the promises of God belong
[56:00] to us because we are dwelling in Christ
[56:04] I mean with me now so if you abide now
[56:07] you said but how do we abide in Christ
[56:10] now the Reformers have a and there's
[56:13] many many books that they've wrote great
[56:16] books and men like him drew Murray um
[56:18] who wrote for he was a man from South
[56:24] Africa and he wrote for a movement there
[56:28] that was and wrote some many wonderful
[56:31] books on abiding in Christ and and many
[56:35] many of these were talking about how you
[56:38] abide in Christ and to bide in Christ
[56:41] was you know so much the reading of your
[56:43] Bible and so much study in the books and
[56:46] and and feeding on the word and here's
[56:49] how you abide in Christ that's not how
[56:52] you abide in Christ that's the
[56:54] understanding of the reformers but that
[56:57] is not our revelation the way that we
[57:00] abide in Christ is that the Spirit of
[57:03] Jesus abide in us you see is a
[57:08] oneness a unity if you abide in me and
[57:12] my words abide in you you shall ask what
[57:16] you will it's a oneness between you and
[57:19] God
[57:20] so how do you dwell in Christ there's
[57:22] only one way to dwell in Christ and that
[57:26] is being baptized into his body
[57:29] all right and that means that we are
[57:32] filled with His Holy Spirit for by one
[57:35] spirit we are all baptized into that
[57:39] body and so to be filled with the spirit
[57:42] means that you are living in Christ and
[57:45] you are your flesh of his flesh and your
[57:50] spirit of his spirit in other words
[57:51] you're the body that he's living and
[57:54] operating in so if you if my words live
[57:59] in you you shall ask what you will and
[58:01] the word will drive out the inhabitants
[58:04] of the land
[58:05] you know God would say even to Israel
[58:09] you know I will go before you and I will
[58:11] be a hornet and I will drive them I will
[58:15] I will drive them out of the lamb before
[58:19] you and this is what the Holy Spirit is
[58:22] saying to you that the Holy Spirit that
[58:24] you have within you will drive out every
[58:28] enemy in that is trying to possess a
[58:31] promise of your property that the Word
[58:35] of God clearly gives to you in his Holy
[58:38] Bible now so but again if you will not
[58:42] drive out the inhabitants of the land
[58:44] before you then it should be come to
[58:47] pass that those things which you let
[58:49] remain of them shall be pricks in your
[58:51] eyes and thorns in your sides and so vex
[58:55] you in the land where you dwell so
[58:57] that's number 33 50 55 so he tells you
[59:00] if you let things stay there if you if
[59:04] you don't take some action then then
[59:08] you're gonna be vexed you're gonna be
[59:10] troubled there be pricks in your eyes
[59:12] and thorns in your side
[59:14] and so again we know that we're in a
[59:18] battle today and the battle is set array
[59:22] setting right in every heart of every
[59:25] person that's in this building this
[59:27] morning and he said he's sitting there
[59:30] saying well I've tried before or I've
[59:33] heard that before or we have made
[59:37] efforts before but you see you don't
[59:41] need to argue with the devil our job is
[59:44] to cast him out hey man so what the
[59:48] Bible say he said to cast him out in my
[59:51] name you shall cast out Devils amen we
[59:55] have been trained to do that and brother
[59:58] Branham would ask the question what's
[1:00:00] the matter with us preachers I wonder
[1:00:02] what kind of training that we've got the
[1:00:05] Gulf's training us for this great battle
[1:00:08] and Daniel 12 shows us that there be a
[1:00:12] troublesome time like never before but
[1:00:15] but in that hour Michael shall stand up
[1:00:19] in Revelation chapter 9 shows us a
[1:00:24] belief that would permeate the world and
[1:00:27] it would be like a smoke that has been
[1:00:29] let out of a pit and it would get an
[1:00:32] every crack and crevice of humanity and
[1:00:35] every kind of demon power would operate
[1:00:38] under that cloud of unbelief that would
[1:00:42] be released into this hour disease you
[1:00:45] read it in the Bible is a time where the
[1:00:47] bottomless pit is open and every kind of
[1:00:51] smoking and the spirit of unbelief is
[1:00:54] coming out and under that cloud of
[1:00:57] unbelief it allows every kind of demon
[1:00:59] power to take a hold of people a man but
[1:01:03] I want you to remember revelation 10:1
[1:01:06] begins like this if you just put it up
[1:01:09] on there it begins with the conjunction
[1:01:11] because it's a continuation of the
[1:01:14] chapter before and the chapter before is
[1:01:17] told us of a great smoke in a great
[1:01:20] darkness and all worshiping the Beast
[1:01:22] and all falling down
[1:01:25] to today and worshipping and idolizing
[1:01:28] the spirits that are coming out of this
[1:01:31] this spirit of darkness but I want you
[1:01:34] to notice as it concludes that chapter
[1:01:37] it opens up into revelation 10 and it
[1:01:40] says that I saw another mighty angel
[1:01:45] now the other one describes a polygon
[1:01:47] the other describes a horrible devil the
[1:01:51] other and the other chapter describes
[1:01:53] the trouble sometime
[1:01:55] it describes a time where where where
[1:01:59] there's all kinds of spirits can you
[1:02:01] imagine the spirits that's got upon
[1:02:03] people today that they'll kill their own
[1:02:06] babies in the womb
[1:02:08] whether we're praying for the safety and
[1:02:10] the life of a child in the womb that
[1:02:12] they are actually taking the lives of
[1:02:15] their own babies as they're being born
[1:02:18] what an hour what a terrible day that
[1:02:21] we're living in a manner and so apollyon
[1:02:25] is there and he is there ruling like a
[1:02:29] lion but I want you to notice that he's
[1:02:32] not the only one on the scene and that
[1:02:36] we're not here by ourselves but he said
[1:02:39] and I saw another and he was a mighty
[1:02:43] angel I wouldn't say that at the name of
[1:02:46] Jesus apollyon hats of all the name of
[1:02:50] Jesus every demon that comes out of the
[1:02:53] pit that is destroying our families that
[1:02:56] is destroying the moral fiber of this
[1:02:59] country that is wrecking the world I'd
[1:03:02] say that's the name of this mighty angel
[1:03:05] this
[1:03:12] [Applause]
[1:03:23] everything at this morning
[1:03:36] [Applause]
[1:03:49] hallelujah
[1:03:52] hallelujah
[1:03:54] hallelujah
[1:03:55] [Applause]
[1:03:58] let's pop my eyes were pawned because
[1:04:02] I'm not binded by the unbelief of the
[1:04:06] smoke out of the out of the pit now the
[1:04:14] battle is here it depends on which one's
[1:04:18] your captain and the Goliath is here his
[1:04:23] name he's a lot worse than the Goliath
[1:04:26] back there David's time he's the polygon
[1:04:30] man yeah he's evil he's the one that
[1:04:34] deceived Eve from the beginning he's ill
[1:04:37] he is that old serpent called the devil
[1:04:40] and Satan a man but who will be a David
[1:04:44] in this hour take that little slingshot
[1:04:49] of faith and take it against the enemy
[1:04:52] but I want you to know God's army is
[1:04:55] moving forward we are not retreating but
[1:04:59] yet God has called men and women of
[1:05:01] faith men of power and men and women of
[1:05:05] understanding not that they're smart in
[1:05:08] this world not that they're educated but
[1:05:11] they but there are channels through whom
[1:05:15] the Spirit of God can flow down through
[1:05:18] [Applause]
[1:05:20] if we would look at this mighty angel in
[1:05:23] Revelation 10 we will see he conquers
[1:05:26] with his feet because he puts his feet
[1:05:31] upon the two beasts and the powers that
[1:05:33] are there that arising out of the land
[1:05:35] and the sea so he conquers with his feet
[1:05:40] and these feet are as it were pillars of
[1:05:43] fire so where he touches the earth man
[1:05:48] where where he has his boots on the
[1:05:51] ground and money his feet is his church
[1:05:56] with his church he is triumphant fire
[1:06:03] because why he divided himself on the
[1:06:06] day of pentecost 120 in the upper room
[1:06:10] and he's came in spirit within the
[1:06:14] church that every one of you that could
[1:06:17] have a look at the pillar of fire you
[1:06:21] could possess in your temple the holy
[1:06:24] one the almighty the King of Kings the
[1:06:28] Lord of lords within you is no less than
[1:06:33] his power but we have to be channels we
[1:06:43] all desire to be channels for this
[1:06:45] prevailing faith but in order to have
[1:06:49] prevalent faith we must be people who
[1:06:53] live and dwell in the word of the Bible
[1:06:57] in order to know their God and do
[1:07:02] exploits amen and of course by God
[1:07:06] dwelling in them they're God's sons and
[1:07:08] daughters and because his life and
[1:07:12] dwells them in this this makes them to
[1:07:14] live by faith and and of course they are
[1:07:18] marching if you remember in Revelation
[1:07:21] 19 for example there's an army coming
[1:07:24] out of heaven which is a future event
[1:07:26] but I just want to use it for a moment
[1:07:28] that that the armies of heaven follow
[1:07:31] they follow the word and I want you to
[1:07:36] stir I just want to just touch on it
[1:07:38] just for a moment because that that is a
[1:07:40] future application but I just want to
[1:07:42] take it right now that even on earth
[1:07:44] that there's an army and we're following
[1:07:47] the word amen
[1:07:50] we're following the word and of course
[1:07:52] we're we're exactly like him he was on a
[1:07:55] white horse we're on white horses if he
[1:07:58] comes and power the word we come and
[1:08:00] power the word a man that weirder if he
[1:08:02] yes and holiness we're dressed in
[1:08:04] holiness whatever he is we are a man and
[1:08:09] together we're NAR me
[1:08:11] hey ma'am so you see our captain is we
[1:08:15] want to just look at him for a moment we
[1:08:17] want to see that he upholds all things
[1:08:19] by the word of his power remember we saw
[1:08:24] in the scripture he would cast out
[1:08:26] devils with a word that's what he
[1:08:30] expects you to do with the word the word
[1:08:32] isn't to give you a diploma in knowledge
[1:08:35] the word is given to you to cast out
[1:08:37] devils with a man to push Satan out of
[1:08:42] your life to be an overcomer so you see
[1:08:46] in Hebrews chapter 1 in verse 3 who
[1:08:48] being the brightness of his glory and
[1:08:50] the Express image of his person and
[1:08:53] upholding all things by the word of his
[1:08:56] power he by himself purged our sins and
[1:09:00] sat down at the right hand of the
[1:09:02] Majesty on high so Jesus is not only the
[1:09:06] Creator but he holds dominion over his
[1:09:09] creation every Son of God that is born
[1:09:14] of the new creation is also one who has
[1:09:18] dominion if we look back and Eden and we
[1:09:22] we talk about the Adam
[1:09:24] the way that he was the one with God
[1:09:27] made him he gave him dominion now we can
[1:09:34] all come in the sonship and not how
[1:09:36] Dominion the Bible said he made us unto
[1:09:40] our God kings and priests and a man so
[1:09:44] you can't be a king unless you're ruling
[1:09:46] over something so a real son of God that
[1:09:50] is born of the Spirit of God is people
[1:09:53] who rules by the Word of God are you
[1:09:57] with me now so every son of God is born
[1:10:05] of the new creation and they have
[1:10:07] dominion in other words they have
[1:10:10] prevailing faith they have bait that
[1:10:13] will
[1:10:13] dominate in every situation you see
[1:10:17] everything Jesus did for needy humanity
[1:10:21] during his earthly ministry is a direct
[1:10:24] revelation of the perfect will of God
[1:10:26] for the human race
[1:10:27] so Jesus operated with perfect faith and
[1:10:31] that faith dominated it prevailed over
[1:10:34] every circumstance Jesus
[1:10:38] ruled the winds and the waves of the sea
[1:10:41] by faith hey man now now listen Jesus he
[1:10:47] didn't just have this plan for himself
[1:10:49] but he also had this plan for his
[1:10:51] children it was not only him that walked
[1:10:54] on water but he bade disciples to walk
[1:10:56] on water
[1:10:59] hey man and then Matthew chapter 8 verse
[1:11:03] 26 he said to them why are you fearful
[1:11:06] and you have little faith and then he
[1:11:09] arose now he uses prevalent faith and
[1:11:13] rebuked the winds and the Seas and there
[1:11:16] was a great calm so we see he ruled the
[1:11:19] winds he ruled to see he had dominion
[1:11:24] over his creation his authority then
[1:11:29] dumbfounded those that was around him
[1:11:31] they had never seen a son of God operate
[1:11:35] and the Son of God was now operating in
[1:11:38] his faith and they marveled in verse 27
[1:11:41] saying what manner of man is this that
[1:11:43] even the wind's and the sea obey Him
[1:11:46] this was this was the character of Jesus
[1:11:50] it was a characteristic of his ministry
[1:11:54] now the reason I'm bringing this out is
[1:11:57] because the works that I do shall you do
[1:12:00] also these are the things that he
[1:12:03] cemented in the gospel to make sure that
[1:12:07] you understand that you are not to be
[1:12:10] the downtrodden
[1:12:11] you are not to be the weak
[1:12:14] you are not to be running from your
[1:12:16] enemy you are to be people who are
[1:12:19] overcomers and you are rising up above
[1:12:22] things and you expect the miracles that
[1:12:25] are promised in the Word of God are you
[1:12:29] with me
[1:12:29] my man so as I said you know the
[1:12:33] trademark of Jesus even his doctrine his
[1:12:37] that marveled at his doctrine because he
[1:12:40] didn't preach as a Pharisee or as sad
[1:12:42] you see but he had authority with his
[1:12:45] words this is the difference of real
[1:12:50] disciples of Jesus the real doctrine of
[1:12:55] Jesus come on now is because there is a
[1:12:59] party that is that is given with the
[1:13:02] word that is preached and that authority
[1:13:06] is over unclean spirits that authority
[1:13:09] is over sickness that authority is over
[1:13:12] diseases it is over sin are you with me
[1:13:17] now now when the word is preached
[1:13:20] correctly it will have a party with it
[1:13:23] that's why there's so many that are
[1:13:26] preaching and they're using quotes and
[1:13:28] the prophet of God but the message that
[1:13:30] they have is weak and it will not save
[1:13:33] and it will not heal and it will not
[1:13:36] deliver and it will not produce even joy
[1:13:39] or a rejoicing it is dead because their
[1:13:42] faith is dead the faith of Jesus is a
[1:13:48] living faith it is a prevailing faith it
[1:13:52] is more than just a doctrine but it is
[1:13:55] of the doctrine with authority
[1:13:58] people who know their God and they do
[1:14:01] exploits Jesus ruled the fish in the sea
[1:14:09] for the Book of Luke it tells of him
[1:14:12] saying the Peter put your net on the
[1:14:14] other side and Peter's could say now
[1:14:17] I'll tell you what I know I'm a
[1:14:19] fisherman there's not a fish around
[1:14:21] I've already fished all night and I
[1:14:22] didn't catch anything but nevertheless
[1:14:24] it that word I'll let down the net you
[1:14:29] see that's where the nets were filled
[1:14:31] instantly and because that's where faith
[1:14:34] prevails and the same was true after his
[1:14:38] resurrection Jesus had bread and fish on
[1:14:41] the fire bread that was never first
[1:14:43] wheat and then ground into bread and
[1:14:47] fish that had never been in the sea and
[1:14:51] yet he could say children have you hit
[1:14:54] him eat a man catch their net on the
[1:14:57] right side of the boat and cuz he had
[1:14:59] rule over the fish hey man there was a
[1:15:04] hundred and fifty three that they caught
[1:15:06] and they got so many until their nets
[1:15:08] begin to break is that right
[1:15:12] everybody already it showed he had
[1:15:14] Dominion he had a prevailing faith about
[1:15:20] Jesus and you said but that was Jesus
[1:15:24] Jesus was only demonstrated what God he
[1:15:28] gets to be in your flesh by man now in
[1:15:33] marker 132 when the Sun did set and they
[1:15:37] were brought in to him they brought unto
[1:15:39] him all that were diseased and them that
[1:15:42] were possessed with devils and all the
[1:15:45] city was gathered together at the door
[1:15:47] and He healed many that were sick of
[1:15:50] divers diseases and cast out many devils
[1:15:54] and suffered not the devil's to speak
[1:15:57] because they knew him you see Jesus
[1:16:02] ruled over Devils days demons had to
[1:16:05] recognize his Lord
[1:16:07] yep because he gave them or he had
[1:16:10] dominion over them and he commissioned
[1:16:13] his church to do the same and I'll tell
[1:16:16] you what today we ought to make it up in
[1:16:18] our minds in our hearts today I am gonna
[1:16:22] declare war on the devil I'm not gonna
[1:16:28] allow him live here on one piece of my
[1:16:31] property I have been told to drive him
[1:16:35] out I know the Lord will go before me
[1:16:39] with Hornets I know that God will
[1:16:42] torment Devils on my sake
[1:16:45] Amanda he'll go before me and the pillar
[1:16:47] fire moves before us is somebody with me
[1:16:50] now amen and because we must declare war
[1:16:55] on the every form of sickness and take
[1:16:59] authority over ever demon power through
[1:17:02] the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah now
[1:17:06] the book of John illustrates that Jesus
[1:17:10] is Lord over the grave I'll tell you
[1:17:13] we're gonna need some of that we're
[1:17:16] gonna need to be able to exercise that
[1:17:18] lordship even for at the tomb of Lazarus
[1:17:21] Jesus was master of the dead and no
[1:17:24] matter whether the circumstances wonder
[1:17:27] what they said Lazarus is dead he looked
[1:17:31] dead the doctor declared him dead he
[1:17:34] felt dead he smelled dead but Jesus had
[1:17:38] dominating faith over death anyway
[1:17:41] regardless of what the census said come
[1:17:46] on
[1:17:46] he had dominating faith over every bit
[1:17:49] of that he had dominion over the trees
[1:17:52] he would walk by three and say to that
[1:17:57] tree commanded to die no fruit come
[1:18:00] forth forth from you from this day on
[1:18:02] and by by his own faith it dried up from
[1:18:06] the roots
[1:18:07] he had prevailing faith hey man it was
[1:18:12] my faith he made the world's and it was
[1:18:16] by faith that the righteous are to live
[1:18:19] by come on now the just are the
[1:18:25] righteous shall live by faith we're
[1:18:30] we're not listen jerks we're not just a
[1:18:33] half faith we are to live by that faith
[1:18:36] we are the exercise of faith we're to
[1:18:40] move in that faith and we are to prevail
[1:18:43] with that faith now Galatians chapter 2
[1:18:49] verse 20 this says I am crucified with
[1:18:52] Christ therefore I am I am dead to sin
[1:18:56] and unbelief right if we're crucified
[1:19:01] we're dead to sin and unbelief
[1:19:02] nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ
[1:19:06] liveth in me and the life which I now
[1:19:08] live in the flesh I live by the faith of
[1:19:12] the son of God here again we live by
[1:19:16] faith whose faith his faith you seem to
[1:19:24] be born of God is to be born and his
[1:19:27] attributes and God believes he believes
[1:19:32] his own word this is how he created the
[1:19:35] world he said let there be and he
[1:19:38] believed it
[1:19:39] a man he proclaimed and he stood behind
[1:19:44] it believing it that's exactly right and
[1:19:47] there's nothing such as for Balaam power
[1:19:50] as a revelation of the word it's a
[1:19:52] revelation of God than to give you a
[1:19:54] party of the devil and you wonder what
[1:19:56] kind of Revelation is that it's a
[1:19:59] revelation I am
[1:20:00] God and if I'm his son then I'm in his
[1:20:04] image and if we prevail empower and
[1:20:07] prevail in faith I have that same phrase
[1:20:09] that will prevail with my life that will
[1:20:13] defeat ever devil that will help me to
[1:20:16] overcome that nothing could stop us all
[1:20:22] right now so again that is our
[1:20:25] revelation by first birth when we were
[1:20:28] born as this little baby was born and we
[1:20:32] talked about it when we were born all of
[1:20:35] us like the same we used to live but and
[1:20:38] we were by our feet our five senses but
[1:20:41] you see our new birth we do not live by
[1:20:45] see taste smell feeling here it has
[1:20:49] nothing to do with this round it has
[1:20:53] nothing to do with God
[1:20:56] it is only things that you contact the
[1:20:58] earth it is not what you contact heaven
[1:21:02] with amen so again it is only faith is
[1:21:08] the only thing that contact centered
[1:21:10] around faith is the only thing that can
[1:21:12] see that other round faith can see what
[1:21:15] you cannot feel what you cannot see
[1:21:18] naturally what you cannot hear with your
[1:21:20] ears what you cannot feel with your
[1:21:23] hands what you teach smell with your
[1:21:25] nose what you gain taste with your mouth
[1:21:27] and man faith sees what your senses
[1:21:31] cannot declare
[1:21:34] and with how did you bind to all that
[1:21:36] heaven is this is why without faith you
[1:21:43] cannot please God
[1:21:45] now our first merchants have said it
[1:21:49] caused us to be born blind we were born
[1:21:53] in sin and so we were blind to the
[1:21:55] supernatural we were blind to to the
[1:21:58] rounds of things of God and the promises
[1:22:00] of God
[1:22:01] we were only since bound people we had
[1:22:06] no true faith the only mental faith our
[1:22:09] second birth the Holy Ghost gives us the
[1:22:12] faith for what was otherwise impossible
[1:22:16] when we when we look here today I'm
[1:22:20] looking at both men and women that it
[1:22:22] was impossible their situation was
[1:22:25] impossible to save impossible to be
[1:22:29] delivered on things that I couldn't help
[1:22:33] you with things that medicines that the
[1:22:36] doctors would give could not cure but it
[1:22:40] gave you the ability to do that which
[1:22:42] was impossible to believe far the
[1:22:46] impossible because those who believe all
[1:22:50] things are possible to them that believe
[1:22:54] a man but but you see too often
[1:22:59] we do not have real faith we have mental
[1:23:02] faith and that's the problem is the
[1:23:06] faith the people have requires feeling
[1:23:10] it requires seed it requires hearing and
[1:23:15] the biggest part of our faith today is
[1:23:18] mental of faith by hearing the Word of
[1:23:24] God it brings us into a mental
[1:23:26] recognition and acknowledgement of God
[1:23:29] we mentally agree mental fades is based
[1:23:34] on the five senses this is this is why
[1:23:38] brother madam would try to tell us in
[1:23:40] our new birth don't be dependent on
[1:23:42] emotion or a sensation or a tongue or
[1:23:47] dance don't let that be what you're
[1:23:51] looking for depending upon your your
[1:23:54] place and your faith in the unsalables
[1:23:59] Unsinkable Word of God and that's where
[1:24:02] your foundation is when you don't feel
[1:24:05] sane I mean when you're not feeling it
[1:24:10] anymore you know what God said and you
[1:24:14] can see the evidence were called down to
[1:24:18] the Bible and it works right here
[1:24:20] plumbers and it's worked in my life and
[1:24:23] today when I feel it or not I know I'm
[1:24:26] saved I'm where the outward man perishes
[1:24:31] then it's depressed not worried it's
[1:24:35] confused there is something that holds
[1:24:37] within the veil and everstorm it's an
[1:24:41] anchor but the soul but mental faith is
[1:24:46] based on the five senses it looks so
[1:24:50] much like real faith
[1:24:52] they're so deceiving that most people
[1:24:56] don't know the difference
[1:24:58] mental faith is a mental acknowledgment
[1:25:02] that the Word of God is true mental
[1:25:05] faith will see it mental faith admires
[1:25:09] it mental faith you know acknowledges it
[1:25:14] by all of this but although I'll saying
[1:25:17] is true but it's not my case
[1:25:22] you see mental faith agrees that the
[1:25:26] Word of God is a revelation then it
[1:25:28] comes of God and and the word is true
[1:25:31] yet when a crisis comes it don't work
[1:25:34] it simply recognizes the truthfulness of
[1:25:38] the wonderful promises that it contains
[1:25:41] but it
[1:25:42] acts upon it mental fades its
[1:25:47] intellectual fades it's a dead faith
[1:25:50] because real faith is alive and real
[1:25:53] faith acts the Bible tells us clearly
[1:25:57] that faith that doesn't act is dead says
[1:26:01] faith without works but it's the same
[1:26:02] thing if it has no action if it doesn't
[1:26:05] work it's dead we can say I believe in
[1:26:11] miracles but we must act upon that and
[1:26:14] my weekend we can say I believe is a
[1:26:16] healer but we must act upon that we
[1:26:19] might we can say well I believe the Holy
[1:26:21] Ghost is ever generation but we must act
[1:26:24] upon that and man we must believe we
[1:26:27] must profess it we must confess it we
[1:26:30] must hold it as our own and we must
[1:26:32] prevail with it now well this is what
[1:26:37] many people have received is just a
[1:26:39] mental faith an acknowledgment that the
[1:26:42] message is right and the glory of what
[1:26:45] it was done in the past but they know
[1:26:47] nothing of his power mental faith will
[1:26:51] not heal it will not see miracles I'll
[1:26:57] just show you a little quotation from
[1:27:01] God's only provided place the branham's
[1:27:04] was saying this just before he departs
[1:27:07] him this life in fact I probably was
[1:27:10] there when he when he spoke this I was a
[1:27:13] young boy but he says I believe the
[1:27:15] church is beginning to hear the message
[1:27:17] and beginning to understand it but
[1:27:20] Fritz's friends listen we've got to lay
[1:27:23] in the presence of the Sun we've got to
[1:27:26] be ripened I'm right intellectually
[1:27:32] we're hearing the message that God has
[1:27:35] given us and we're seeing the signs that
[1:27:37] he showed us and proven it by the Bible
[1:27:40] it's there but all how the church needs
[1:27:42] to lay in his presence till it tenders
[1:27:45] up you know and get Sweden
[1:27:47] the spirits I can just bathe down
[1:27:50] sometimes speaking the message you get
[1:27:52] hearts and you have to break it in like
[1:27:54] that because you got a cleansing nail to
[1:27:56] make it whole but once the church when
[1:27:59] the church once gets it the elected is
[1:28:02] called out and separated then in the
[1:28:05] presence of God I know it will be like
[1:28:07] it will be something like those people
[1:28:10] were beyond the curtain of time was was
[1:28:13] when it takes a rapture now you see
[1:28:17] beyond the curtain of time they don't
[1:28:19] question whether God is true beyond the
[1:28:24] curtain of time you know all doubts
[1:28:26] yourself
[1:28:27] the word is not argued there's no R
[1:28:31] within them I'm a beyond the curtain of
[1:28:36] time the word is settled eternally in
[1:28:39] heaven beyond the curtain of time then
[1:28:43] there's no doubt among them they're full
[1:28:46] of the Holy Ghost they never doubt they
[1:28:49] rest of them the fact that Jesus is
[1:28:52] coming back a man they rest upon knowing
[1:28:56] that this message is what Paul preached
[1:28:59] and there's no murmuring or
[1:29:02] second-guessing what they believe and
[1:29:05] we've got to be in that same state
[1:29:08] before the rapture comes that our faith
[1:29:12] is secure then it is settled that it is
[1:29:15] anchored and that is ripe and a mature
[1:29:19] faith a faith that prevails now again
[1:29:27] this is this is the hour that we're out
[1:29:29] you see we must know our position
[1:29:33] because even brother Branham would say
[1:29:36] once the church knows its position it
[1:29:39] when they realize who they are when you
[1:29:42] realize what the blood is done for you
[1:29:46] people don't even realize what's in the
[1:29:49] atonement they don't even realize that
[1:29:52] it's God's will for you to be healed
[1:29:56] that jesus paid it all that it's already
[1:30:00] paid for that he doesn't have to do one
[1:30:02] more thing to provide it for you it's a
[1:30:05] finished work man it's a finished
[1:30:10] working and you're under the blood and
[1:30:13] he has taken your sins and he has
[1:30:16] pardoned your transgression oh I want to
[1:30:19] say he's more than pardoned it he's
[1:30:21] removed them he's annihilated ever since
[1:30:27] and you stand justified
[1:30:29] let's do you never did it and yet you
[1:30:33] know you did it
[1:30:35] hey man but in his sight you've never
[1:30:38] done it because he's not looking at what
[1:30:42] you were as a child of the devil he's
[1:30:45] looking at who you are as a son of God
[1:30:48] and he sees you he didn't see you deform
[1:30:57] decrepit and your spirit he didn't see
[1:31:00] you weary and worn down he's sorry
[1:31:03] Josiah
[1:31:05] he said where were you when the sons of
[1:31:08] God were shouting for joy man what was
[1:31:11] he doing Eva's already seeing you shout
[1:31:14] right here in this layout of Oh
[1:31:17] [Applause]
[1:31:34] faith prevails but positionally people
[1:31:42] don't know who they are they don't even
[1:31:44] know what they don't they don't even
[1:31:46] sometimes there's been so much confusion
[1:31:48] that people don't even know he's still
[1:31:51] on the mercy seat that he's still the
[1:31:54] high priest that he still can be touched
[1:31:56] by the feelings of your infirmity they
[1:32:00] know they become so educated until God's
[1:32:04] out of the picture your sons and
[1:32:10] daughters of God that's who you are not
[1:32:14] will be the Bible declares snap you are
[1:32:20] the sons of God and a lot of times
[1:32:23] you're looking for something great to
[1:32:25] come but you've already got it you've
[1:32:30] got the greatest thing that can get me
[1:32:32] given to you to your body change and
[1:32:34] that's the Holy Ghost a man and you
[1:32:38] right now you are seated with him in
[1:32:40] heavenly places and if you're with him
[1:32:43] then you you can sit with him and expect
[1:32:46] every enemy to come under your feet
[1:32:50] because that thought he does on his
[1:32:53] throne he sat down expecting every enemy
[1:32:57] to come bow down before him and when
[1:33:01] you're sitting with Christ you're doing
[1:33:04] the same thing you are sitting there
[1:33:06] expecting that you're a son of God by
[1:33:13] the blood and have the authority to cast
[1:33:15] him out we're right now seated with him
[1:33:22] now when faith gets like that in the
[1:33:24] church the devil moves away from the
[1:33:27] church I want you to know and we're
[1:33:32] going to be speaking on this and
[1:33:33] services to come but Satan has no legal
[1:33:38] rights
[1:33:41] everything that he does to you is ill
[1:33:44] legally done God does not allow a dead
[1:33:52] guy you said well God he allowed this
[1:33:54] that listen God allowed man to sin in
[1:33:57] the beginning he didn't make him a robot
[1:33:59] God allowed him to make a choice hey man
[1:34:04] but friends don't go to talk about that
[1:34:06] choice hey man let's go back to this
[1:34:09] choice he chose me
[1:34:12] what about that choice we want to point
[1:34:15] back to man's choice and his choosen
[1:34:18] failure what about God choosing you to
[1:34:20] be one with prevalent faith and an
[1:34:22] overcomer he chose you to be a peculiar
[1:34:26] people to be a different somebody that
[1:34:29] he owns somebody that's his bride
[1:34:32] something that buddy Dennis he can say
[1:34:34] that's flesh of my flesh and right for
[1:34:36] my life I chose you to Pisa let's just
[1:34:46] go over just a simple simple thing let's
[1:34:50] go back to Ephesians 1 and verse 1 I'll
[1:34:54] have them bring it on the screen cuz I I
[1:34:56] can't I didn't have this in my notes but
[1:35:02] Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
[1:35:05] will of God one cent one cent that's
[1:35:10] what an apostle yes by the will of God
[1:35:12] to the Saints which are in Ephesus and
[1:35:16] not just to him but to the faithful in
[1:35:19] Christ Jesus grace be to you and peace
[1:35:26] from God our Father and from our Lord
[1:35:29] Jesus Christ hey man this is him saying
[1:35:33] like he did to Mary you're highly
[1:35:35] favored of the Lord that's got a lot of
[1:35:38] great cities upon your life you're
[1:35:40] highly favored grace be to you and peace
[1:35:44] from God our Father blessed be the God
[1:35:47] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[1:35:49] has blessed us with some blessings oh

[1:36:03] throw me over in with a bunch of this
[1:36:04] even preachers well you got some of them
[1:36:08] but we're right here spiritual blessings
[1:36:16] where where it does these blessings vote
[1:36:19] in our position in the Holy Ghost a man
[1:36:24] will be his blessed us if we're in the
[1:36:28] Holy Ghost it with his word abides in us
[1:36:31] if we abide in him if we have his spirit
[1:36:34] that he has blessed us with all
[1:36:37] spiritual blessings in our position so
[1:36:43] our position comes with blessings
[1:36:46] so we're blessed everywhere you look no
[1:36:50] harm can come come on hey man we we're
[1:36:54] blessed
[1:36:55] look at it next look at what he said
[1:36:57] according as he hath you didn't choose
[1:37:03] him he told you oh man when did he
[1:37:09] choose you ah
[1:37:12] when Oh them before you sinned
[1:37:18] [Applause]
[1:37:20] before you did anything wrong before you
[1:37:24] had that past he chose you he chose you
[1:37:32] in spite of everything that people tried
[1:37:35] to do to you
[1:37:36] he told you it how where did he choose
[1:37:40] you not at the altar but before the
[1:37:43] foundation of the world
[1:37:50] and to think about this God he can never
[1:37:53] [Applause]
[1:37:55] change his mind about you
[1:38:04] [Applause]
[1:38:07] get a new thought he can never change
[1:38:15] his mind he said well I wasn't that
[1:38:22] brother Tim but he chose you to me and
[1:38:26] because he chose you to be look what he
[1:38:29] did he didn't chose you because you
[1:38:31] because you were holy look at the Bible
[1:38:37] or without blame cuz you know good and
[1:38:40] well you were not holy and you were not
[1:38:43] without blame right but that's not what
[1:38:47] it said he chose you to be holy he chose
[1:38:53] you to be without blame he chose you to
[1:38:57] be a spotless bride and you said well I
[1:39:01] wasn't dad and brother timber but you
[1:39:05] see him God's chose you to be that and
[1:39:08] he said you would be that and that was
[1:39:10] in his mind and the devil did something
[1:39:13] to you that he's gonna do the work of
[1:39:15] redemption
[1:39:17] to do everything in all of his God ship
[1:39:22] and his lordship to bring you to this
[1:39:24] very place to bring a word that'll wash
[1:39:27] you to bring a black devil save you
[1:39:30] cleanse you and praise you and make his
[1:39:34] blackness because he said you're gonna
[1:39:37] be that now this is a God that demands
[1:39:43] perfection and when he was on earth he
[1:39:47] said be you therefore perfect
[1:39:55] how perfect lord as even my father in
[1:40:01] heaven is perfect
[1:40:07] well let's close up and go home ain't
[1:40:10] none of us can do that but that's only
[1:40:13] one side of the coin hey man if he
[1:40:18] thought if he said you got to be that
[1:40:20] and you can't and I couldn't and you
[1:40:26] couldn't and no man could then he came
[1:40:31] down into your sin so you can be his
[1:40:34] righteousness so you can be as perfect
[1:40:38] as your father in heaven is perfect
[1:40:43] hallelujah that's who I'm preaching to
[1:40:45] this lauren the men that there's no
[1:40:48] shame on you
[1:40:49] [Applause]
[1:41:06] that was the problem with the law he
[1:41:09] told him what he wanted done but they
[1:41:11] had no power to do it so Jesus came to
[1:41:13] give us the power and it's all in the
[1:41:22] atonement he paid it all get the next
[1:41:28] verse he predestinated you unto the
[1:41:34] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:41:37] himself do you know you were
[1:41:39] predestinated to become a son before you
[1:41:43] were known as a son he predestinated you
[1:41:47] to adoption he predestinated you to the
[1:41:52] Holy Ghost he predestinated you to the
[1:41:56] body change
[1:41:57] he's predestinated you all the way do
[1:42:01] you know what predestinated means it
[1:42:03] means he determined your destiny
[1:42:09] so do you know I'm talking to this
[1:42:11] morning I'm talking to people whose
[1:42:13] destiny has been determined
[1:42:20] come on I'm out if God enough stop this
[1:42:24] for me
[1:42:25] if God told David and He pours him on
[1:42:28] and oil over David and he anoints him
[1:42:30] there with oil and there it pours it
[1:42:33] upon that little loom God David and said
[1:42:36] you're gonna sit on the throne
[1:42:40] now the Goliath could come around and
[1:42:43] kill him God's Word isn't true
[1:42:46] so David could come up against the
[1:42:48] Goliath and know he had been anointed
[1:42:52] our prophet had anointed him with oil
[1:42:55] and told him you're gonna sit on the
[1:42:59] throne and so no Goliath could stand
[1:43:03] before him so when he looked at glad he
[1:43:08] already knew he's defeated
[1:43:11] hallelujah you can look at every
[1:43:13] obstacle you can look at every problem
[1:43:16] cause God sent a message in this day
[1:43:19] prophet has anointed you with the oil of
[1:43:23] the holy girls and poured out the
[1:43:25] anointing oil of all the people in the
[1:43:27] same time and you are invited to sit on
[1:43:32] the throne read your Bible read what it
[1:43:36] said about Laodiceans overcometh will I
[1:43:41] grant to sit with me in my throne now
[1:43:47] you're gonna do it without a battle but
[1:43:49] even as I overcame and I said that was
[1:43:53] my father in his throne you're gonna
[1:43:55] overcome I'm trying to tell you this
[1:43:58] morning you are going to over come I'm
[1:44:04] trying to tell you you're not in the
[1:44:07] winner's circle you're the winner
[1:44:17] hallelujah how are you gonna do this by
[1:44:20] the prevalent faith that's in me so he
[1:44:24] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:44:26] children by Jesus Christ to himself just
[1:44:30] because of the good pleasure of his on
[1:44:33] will not cause what you did or didn't do
[1:44:38] because of his good pleasure of doing
[1:44:41] what he wanted to do cuz he wants to
[1:44:48] bless you because he wants to empower
[1:44:50] you because he wants you to walk in
[1:44:53] victory because he wants you to defeat
[1:44:56] that sickness in your body that cancer
[1:44:59] that heart trouble that disease that
[1:45:00] what because he wants you because he
[1:45:04] wants you to rise up over sin do you
[1:45:09] know the victory that Jesus has in you
[1:45:12] you know this is why he wears many
[1:45:14] crowns because it's not just his victory
[1:45:18] that he's wearing where he rose up over
[1:45:21] death head of the hell in the grave but
[1:45:23] here upon his head are many crowns
[1:45:25] because really he's the one that had
[1:45:28] victory in your life my life in our life
[1:45:30] come on man so therefore a man he is the
[1:45:34] one who is crowned with our victory this
[1:45:42] is what heaven laughs did somebody hear
[1:45:46] me heaven laughs when one sinner repents
[1:45:50] [Music]
[1:45:53] so it rejoices well okay I laugh when I
[1:45:57] rejoice I shall die scream I cry I laugh
[1:46:00] and heaven laughs haha you covered her
[1:46:14] up with
[1:46:15] haha
[1:46:36] [Applause]
[1:46:45] [Applause]
[1:46:55] and he knows nothing you've been through
[1:47:00] nothing the devil can do no matter how
[1:47:04] many trips he's tried nothing can stop
[1:47:09] his plan I'll take you from your destiny
[1:47:17] well that ought to give us or something
[1:47:20] to shout about your chosen elect
[1:47:28] precious valuable something he would
[1:47:33] leave all of heaven far and give up give
[1:47:38] up the very throne to come down and be
[1:47:41] one of us to take on our burden to
[1:47:49] prevail now let's think of this chosen
[1:47:57] us in him before the foundation of world
[1:47:59] hope your mind they didn't mind that
[1:48:01] little sachet right there
[1:48:06] Satan hadn't got any legal right on you
[1:48:11] everything he does to you is illegal he
[1:48:18] has no right to put sickness on your
[1:48:20] disease he doesn't have any right to do
[1:48:23] anything to you and man we got every
[1:48:26] promise in the Word of God what God said
[1:48:28] he would do come on now in circles in
[1:48:32] there the other people have no right to
[1:48:35] that land they cannot say they cannot
[1:48:39] stay on any piece of the property every
[1:48:42] bit of it belongs to Israel are you with
[1:48:46] me
[1:48:46] oh man the Golan Heights belong
[1:48:49] and the West Bank belongs everything
[1:48:51] that God said in his word belongs and
[1:48:55] ever devil there is was going to get off
[1:48:58] man he's gotta get in he's a squatter on
[1:49:01] your yield he's got to get off if he's a
[1:49:04] squatter on your joy he's got to get off
[1:49:06] if he's a squatter on the Indian to the
[1:49:09] promise of God he's got to get off and
[1:49:12] you have the right when you were born
[1:49:31] again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:49:34] come into your heart everything you have
[1:49:36] needed for the journey is in you right
[1:49:38] then it's in the Holy Ghost and all you
[1:49:42] got to do is start drinking and push out
[1:49:44] just like a little little little apple
[1:49:47] seedling it's got ever Apple that will
[1:49:50] ever be in it in the seedling man it's
[1:49:54] got ever Apple it's got a belief it's
[1:49:56] got every branch all of it is in the
[1:49:59] seed and when God gives you the Holy
[1:50:01] Ghost and everything's in the Holy Ghost
[1:50:03] and all you got to do is just put your
[1:50:07] roots down in the Word of God and drink
[1:50:09] on the Holy Spirit those nutrients that
[1:50:13] are in the soil of the word and bring
[1:50:15] them up and push out and the more you
[1:50:20] drink the more and the more you push out
[1:50:22] the bigger your happen the more fruits
[1:50:25] you have now that's the problem though
[1:50:31] yram oh I remain a little dwarf apple
[1:50:35] when we can be a big fruit tree
[1:50:39] this is a father's wheel that you bring
[1:50:42] forth much fruit and that fruit shall
[1:50:46] remain this is what we found in in the
[1:50:50] in the book of John
[1:50:53] but since bound faith is dependent on
[1:50:56] feelings or seeing but you must act on
[1:51:00] the word
[1:51:01] as your probably as your as your
[1:51:04] personal property you know let me just
[1:51:07] share some thoughts of this when a man
[1:51:10] can have an intellectual faith and
[1:51:14] that's what most people get today
[1:51:16] calling themselves Christian the reason
[1:51:18] you're carrying on as you do under the
[1:51:20] name of Christianity is only
[1:51:21] intellectual faith this is why this is
[1:51:23] why people can call herself Christian
[1:51:26] and smoke and drink and when they're
[1:51:28] just Church donors and they they just go
[1:51:30] right on and because they have
[1:51:33] intellectual faith you see you said but
[1:51:40] what do you mean by intellectual faith
[1:51:43] well men believe it on the salvation and
[1:51:45] faith cometh by hearing here in the Word
[1:51:47] of God and we can preach the word and
[1:51:50] you can accept it and you say well
[1:51:52] that's right I believe it but if that's
[1:51:54] all the Varia far as you go you'll never
[1:51:56] get very far with God you see that's
[1:51:58] very that's just an intellectual faith
[1:52:01] that is an acknowledgment that the word
[1:52:03] is right and this is a reason that a lot
[1:52:06] of people don't get healed is because
[1:52:09] they're only taking an intellectual view
[1:52:11] of it what their mind conceived but the
[1:52:15] mind can't will reason and say it can't
[1:52:17] be I'm no better my sense of sight says
[1:52:21] my arm is no straighter than it was
[1:52:23] yesterday or my sense of Eden said I
[1:52:26] don't feel any difference then I used to
[1:52:28] have never felt before reasoning and
[1:52:31] mental theology will reason it out and
[1:52:33] say well wait a minute I got it that's
[1:52:36] got to be foolishness then you see and
[1:52:38] the moment you start reasoning you know
[1:52:41] it's it's it's showing that your faith
[1:52:43] was only intellectual but what's the
[1:52:47] faith comes from the mind
[1:52:50] the intellect down into the heart
[1:52:53] it'll never questioned it anymore it's
[1:52:57] absolutely a fact it'll agree with the
[1:53:00] Word of God and that's the reason people
[1:53:03] don't get where they should be is
[1:53:04] because they have a mental conception of
[1:53:07] God you believe in by the intellectual
[1:53:10] faith but that'll never work
[1:53:12] it'll never prevail it's a dead faith
[1:53:16] it's a faith that is scared that is
[1:53:18] dependent on how I feel today or my
[1:53:22] circumstances or something else you know
[1:53:24] but when your faith is brought down into
[1:53:27] the compartment of the heart wounded
[1:53:29] resident within the soul and that
[1:53:32] revelation is the gaudiest and that he
[1:53:37] rewards those that diligently seek Him
[1:53:39] then faith says it so it no matter what
[1:53:44] our feeling says no matter what I think
[1:53:46] it says no matter what our side the
[1:53:49] class Amen face says it so anyhow God's
[1:53:53] Word is true no matter what I see what I
[1:53:56] feel what I what the circumstances are
[1:53:59] now there must be a people with eyes of
[1:54:03] faith who can see beyond what the five
[1:54:06] senses declare they cannot be just
[1:54:10] blinded Laodiceans now Laodicea
[1:54:15] their faith is blinded by the glamour of
[1:54:18] what they see around them and they see
[1:54:22] the you know the success of Laodicea and
[1:54:26] and and they see that is God's blessings
[1:54:29] God's blessings is not I mean I think
[1:54:33] God could bless you with riches that's
[1:54:35] that's fine but there are the times
[1:54:36] riches is a curse
[1:54:38] I mean there's nothing more valuable
[1:54:40] than being a Christian
[1:54:43] a man your wealth a lot of people look
[1:54:48] for a lot of things but the value what's
[1:54:51] really value is being a son or daughter
[1:54:54] of God if you live in a pole barn or
[1:54:58] whatever you Olivia you know that
[1:55:00] doesn't matter you know that does he
[1:55:01] make who you are whatever it is the word
[1:55:04] must live now of course you know we can
[1:55:10] have generations that would start maybe
[1:55:13] maybe they would start with their eyes
[1:55:15] and they would bind them up and you
[1:55:17] start for generation after generation
[1:55:19] every child is born and you make them
[1:55:22] well you know where they can never see
[1:55:23] you know a baby when it's born it has
[1:55:27] the eyes but it can't focus it can it
[1:55:32] can there's a lot of things that it's
[1:55:34] not discerning and it's not focusing and
[1:55:38] it's not seeing clearly and it's only
[1:55:39] seeing do and it's not doesn't have the
[1:55:42] perception but through use that sense is
[1:55:48] developed a man and the older he gets
[1:55:51] the more he begins to see and becomes
[1:55:54] alert to what's around and begins to see
[1:55:56] further and further and further because
[1:55:59] his since is exercised now as we were
[1:56:05] saying that if you don't use your senses
[1:56:08] they become dormant they won't act at
[1:56:11] all it is said that if you bind up the
[1:56:14] tile for this generation and never let
[1:56:17] him see never learns to see and then the
[1:56:20] next generation after a while children
[1:56:22] well that the lineage will be born
[1:56:25] unable to see now because if we don't
[1:56:30] use our senses they become dormant that
[1:56:35] won't act at all and that's what the
[1:56:38] church has done to the sixth sense of
[1:56:40] faith that God put in him he played you
[1:56:44] know we placed faith off you know that
[1:56:47] we we don't have miracles no more we
[1:56:49] don't have healing we don't have
[1:56:52] and we set our eyes to faith until we
[1:56:55] refuse to see that science or to follow
[1:56:58] them that believe and we did we disk
[1:57:02] with this phantom and we become
[1:57:05] sightless and I'm being able to believe
[1:57:07] it's miracles and I just want you to
[1:57:10] understand this is all things we've had
[1:57:12] generations generations of chirps
[1:57:16] religion that is foot blinders on the
[1:57:21] eyes of the people
[1:57:22] Jason miracles are passive it was only
[1:57:26] for them and it ain't for now and God
[1:57:29] can but not God will all of the other
[1:57:32] mirrors and generations of unbelief
[1:57:35] until we got Christians who are born
[1:57:38] blind and faithless because they're only
[1:57:43] born with intellectual faith but God
[1:57:48] wants his children to have prevailing
[1:57:50] faith he wants them to have his faith
[1:57:54] amen to live by the faith of the Son of
[1:57:57] God a man so again we we begin to have
[1:58:01] things and and and first thing you know
[1:58:04] it's we know that a lot of it is because
[1:58:07] there's a lack of faith that is priest
[1:58:10] you can I just say something the reason
[1:58:13] they're not miracles that are happening
[1:58:15] in the Lutheran Church is because
[1:58:17] they're not taught it's not preached
[1:58:24] it's not preached Jesus is the saying
[1:58:27] I'm not picking on the Luther Jews any
[1:58:29] denomination you want to the reason it's
[1:58:32] not happening is because they have
[1:58:35] generations of black preachers who
[1:58:39] passed on their blindness
[1:58:46] and they passed out and the children
[1:58:49] born in those churches are born blind
[1:58:51] and they don't know the god of miracles
[1:58:57] they don't know God who heals a God who
[1:59:01] delivers kind of bring it down just a
[1:59:05] little more this is a problem around the
[1:59:08] the message today is we got too many
[1:59:11] blind preachers who are raising
[1:59:14] generations of blind people that can
[1:59:19] only talk about they could see back in
[1:59:21] the prophet's day but that was only for
[1:59:23] the prophet
[1:59:24] it can only be back there there's not
[1:59:27] now you know oh don't try to be the
[1:59:29] Prophet I'll tell you what Elijah wanted
[1:59:33] to be Elijah except he wanted a devil
[1:59:36] portion
[1:59:37] I mean what's wrong with us saying we
[1:59:42] want to be everything we saw what a son
[1:59:45] of God could do and what God could do
[1:59:48] suffer God in this generation why can't
[1:59:51] we be a son just like that son a man if
[1:59:56] he was a sheep that was wave saying
[1:59:59] there's more to come then there's gotta
[2:00:01] be a people ride that straight just like
[2:00:03] he had faith that believe just like he
[2:00:06] believed and preachers who are not
[2:00:08] binding their children it's a lack of
[2:00:15] faith being preached into the people
[2:00:18] faith has to be preached into the people
[2:00:22] that makes them let that sixth sense
[2:00:27] which is faith and it must not lay
[2:00:32] dormant it has to be preached and active
[2:00:36] faith so I'm preaching on these things
[2:00:39] brother Taylor couldn't you preach Ilsan
[2:00:41] brother Branham preached on perfect
[2:00:43] faith this is what we must have so you
[2:00:49] know again we can have preaching that
[2:00:52] actually neglects faith yet we can pre
[2:00:55] so hold my flower these sermons of great
[2:00:58] mysteries and oh my we don't even have
[2:01:02] the basic element of faith can't even
[2:01:05] see because you're to walk by faith but
[2:01:11] if you won't buy me you'll fall in the
[2:01:12] ditch this is Bible teaching hey man so
[2:01:17] we must we must have faith preached so
[2:01:21] you see the preaching of faith um Kenda
[2:01:24] can bring faith or the the priam
[2:01:27] preaching that neglects faith will cause
[2:01:30] blind children and the word preached
[2:01:33] without faith is a letter that kills and
[2:01:38] it does not bring to life but if the
[2:01:44] Bible said the word preached did not
[2:01:46] profit them it dude
[2:01:51] it didn't do them any good to hear the
[2:01:53] seals are open the mysteries revealed
[2:01:55] and oh these great wonderful truths and
[2:01:58] look at them in marvel it doesn't do any
[2:02:01] good to preach it unless we mix it with
[2:02:03] faith you know what I preached the other
[2:02:11] day about the opening of the seals and
[2:02:14] the title deed of redemption and the
[2:02:17] clearing of the deed let me ask you
[2:02:20] something brother Johnny did that give
[2:02:21] you faith man did that give you faith
[2:02:24] they give you faith and gave us all
[2:02:27] faith to know our deed is clear that's
[2:02:31] what the word preach has got to do it
[2:02:34] must produce faith faith to want to know
[2:02:38] who you are to know your position not
[2:02:41] just to know your enemy but to know who
[2:02:44] you are
[2:02:46] hey Matt but I want you to just stop for
[2:02:52] a moment we've got a lot of preaching
[2:02:53] today that that binds faith sometimes
[2:02:56] preach this preaching declares that the
[2:03:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost is only a
[2:03:02] temporal gift but that's only true if
[2:03:04] you're Balaam our seller KF is's and
[2:03:06] you're just anointed and ain't nothing
[2:03:10] temporary about the Holy Ghost it's
[2:03:14] eternal
[2:03:14] how could we call it temporary for us
[2:03:17] it's an eternal gift and when it's a
[2:03:20] gift he can't get he's not the Indian
[2:03:22] giver he never touched it back Oh
[2:03:25] somebody help me preach there man he
[2:03:28] God's not an Indian giver if he gave you
[2:03:31] the Holy Ghost he's not gonna take it
[2:03:34] back
[2:03:35] [Applause]
[2:03:37] I'm on notice notice again you see again
[2:03:43] the holy ghost our buys it dwells within
[2:03:46] them and it seals them until the day of
[2:03:50] redemption I want you to know the Holy
[2:03:53] Ghost you received is not temporary I
[2:03:56] stood I sat in a congregation I heard a
[2:03:59] preacher preach and he's the one the
[2:04:00] Holy Ghost we got today won't keep you
[2:04:02] and I looked at him and said huh well
[2:04:05] who wants it what good is it if it won't
[2:04:12] keep me I want you to know it will not
[2:04:15] only save you
[2:04:16] it'll keep you it not only cleanses you
[2:04:20] it fills you it not only feels you it
[2:04:22] sells you how long to the day of
[2:04:25] redemption to the day your body has
[2:04:29] changed Alleluia
[2:04:32] a man but more this faithless preach and
[2:04:36] say well the word develop the day of
[2:04:38] Pentecost will work today and when you
[2:04:40] take that out of context it's used to
[2:04:42] blind people and make them faithless hey
[2:04:47] man I want you to know this is the same
[2:04:50] doctrine that Paul preached this is the
[2:04:53] same word backward teaching by teaching
[2:04:56] line by line letter by letter we have
[2:04:59] returned back to the land of Pentecost
[2:05:01] back to the book of Acts and somebody
[2:05:04] here to help me preach we have returned
[2:05:06] wait a minute
[2:05:08] the book of Acts means the book of
[2:05:09] actions
[2:05:13] but we're the only up society in this
[2:05:17] people it wasn't the Acts of the
[2:05:19] Apostles laxa the Holy Ghost said the
[2:05:21] Apostle a man that we pray you know oh
[2:05:26] he go we want to preach and talk about
[2:05:28] all of the failures and all the problems
[2:05:31] and all the things they had in the book
[2:05:33] of Acts that's not what's being restored
[2:05:36] God ain't bringing us back to the
[2:05:38] bitterness and the problems and the
[2:05:41] failures of the book of Acts he bringing
[2:05:43] us back to the victories now
[2:05:53] you're the vine he's the vine we're the
[2:05:57] branches that's the doctrine of the vine
[2:06:00] the first vines the second branch has to
[2:06:03] produce the same doctrine if he's the
[2:06:04] mind with the branches whatever the
[2:06:06] doctor was and them in the in the in the
[2:06:08] vine has to be in the branch and the
[2:06:11] branch comes on the vine it'll do the
[2:06:13] same thing that the mind did
[2:06:14] a mind and you say well brother deal
[2:06:17] what about that and what word won't work
[2:06:19] but we don't have to we don't have to
[2:06:21] wait in the city of Jerusalem we don't
[2:06:23] have to make a trip back to Mecca or to
[2:06:25] Jerusalem to be endued with power from
[2:06:28] on high we don't even have to wait for
[2:06:30] the Holy Ghost anymore it's already here
[2:06:33] you can receive it today and then the
[2:06:36] reason why they had to wait is because
[2:06:38] the sacrifice had just been made and he
[2:06:41] was a sinner in heaven to make the
[2:06:43] presentation on what the blood is done
[2:06:46] so he can send back the Holy Spirit the
[2:06:49] life of the blood to come live in the
[2:06:51] church and that's why they had the way
[2:06:52] but we don't have to wait anymore we're
[2:06:56] not waiting on the atonement to be
[2:06:58] complete the Tollman is complete
[2:07:01] it is a bullet time and we can receive
[2:07:05] the holy up oh my you can receive it
[2:07:07] right in your seat you can receive it
[2:07:09] right this moment you do not have to
[2:07:12] wait on it any longer now you know there
[2:07:22] again unbelief blind in faith lambs left
[2:07:26] the mercy seat because the only atone
[2:07:30] fragrance why he certainly did atone for
[2:07:33] ignorance but it's ignorant to say
[2:07:35] that's all he atoned for
[2:07:38] that's pretty ignorant a man Heath he
[2:07:42] atoned for unbelief sin of every kind he
[2:07:47] atone for sickness every sickness there
[2:07:50] he is a man he took those tracks in his
[2:07:54] body
[2:07:55] Amen oh my when we just realized that's
[2:07:58] why there's healing and communions amen
[2:08:02] because the blood saved us but the facts
[2:08:05] healed us a man the bread that the body
[2:08:08] that was broken heals us come on man
[2:08:11] that's why that's why we're healing
[2:08:13] because it's in the atomic a man oh you
[2:08:17] know again again we were he's not off
[2:08:21] the mercy seat he's right to here and
[2:08:23] will remain until the physical return of
[2:08:27] Jesus Christ and he today the Bible's
[2:08:30] clear he ever liveth to make
[2:08:33] intercession this is a reason he lives
[2:08:37] he limps listen what he lives for
[2:08:41] you know sometimes people oh man I I
[2:08:44] just have to live for another by the
[2:08:46] Mamas chocolate cake I just live for my
[2:08:53] first cup of coffee but Jesus lives
[2:09:01] he ever lives he can't wait
[2:09:06] it seems delight to intercede on your
[2:09:10] behalf for you to take your burden and
[2:09:15] cast it upon him now he's got the cure
[2:09:18] for your cancer for your sickness for
[2:09:21] your pornography for your sin for
[2:09:23] whatever he's got the cure that you can
[2:09:29] cast your cares on him for he lives to
[2:09:33] do it I know this is not a repeat of
[2:09:40] Pentecost no never again where the Holy
[2:09:42] Ghost
[2:09:43] fall upon 100 Jews 120 Jews in the upper
[2:09:46] room and speaking mirrors of languages
[2:09:48] as as it did there but it'll fall on
[2:09:50] individuals it'll feel them and these
[2:09:54] signs shall follow them that believe and
[2:09:56] in my name they shall cast out devils
[2:10:00] and they will speak in tongues
[2:10:02] they'll prophesy they'll cast out devils
[2:10:05] but any message that blinds the people
[2:10:08] from a Living Christ is a perverted
[2:10:10] message of Satan and that's what's being
[2:10:14] offered into many churches today is a
[2:10:17] dead religion it's a dead religion of
[2:10:22] cold creeds saying the days of miracles
[2:10:27] are past now you know I I don't know
[2:10:30] about you know but I I like my food hot
[2:10:35] if my wife fixes me a bowl of soup and
[2:10:38] it ain't hot enough I said look get some
[2:10:41] more heat on this I can't eat this cold
[2:10:45] man I've never been a fan of cold
[2:10:49] sandwiches
[2:10:50] now you may like them that's okay but I
[2:10:53] won't mine throat in the griddle and I
[2:10:56] wanted heated from top to bottom and
[2:10:58] toasted on both sides I don't like cold
[2:11:02] food and when he so told us to serve the
[2:11:06] lamb he said don't
[2:11:08] serving cold rusev on fire ooh I haven't
[2:11:15] let the fire go out in the churches ever
[2:11:19] serving cold Creed's it will not satisfy
[2:11:22] the hunger of God's children they have
[2:11:26] their food hot
[2:11:27] they gotta bed gotta be sure with fire
[2:11:31] the Holy Ghost get out over what good is
[2:11:34] a sermon if it's cold what good is a
[2:11:38] message images a better cold theology it
[2:11:41] ain't no good
[2:11:42] get the fire the Holy Ghost warming that
[2:11:45] food moving in the church moving in the
[2:11:48] people who warm their bellies fire the
[2:11:53] energy to go out and meet the devil
[2:11:59] what is the message well it's not a
[2:12:03] gospel different from what Paul preached
[2:12:06] brother Branham was told when he went
[2:12:08] beyond the curtain of time that he'd be
[2:12:10] judged as to how he compared with Paul's
[2:12:12] gospel Romans 2:16 says God should judge
[2:12:16] the secrets of men by Jesus Christ
[2:12:19] according to my gospel Paul would say to
[2:12:27] the Galatians I'm surprised you've
[2:12:29] turned another gospel which there is no
[2:12:32] other but rather a make-believe gospel
[2:12:35] just such a nomination of fiction you
[2:12:39] turn from the good news of our
[2:12:41] resurrected Lord Jesus and I want to say
[2:12:45] today who has bewitched us that we obey
[2:12:48] not the truth what kind of spirit would
[2:12:51] want to get in I'm on the stair that
[2:12:54] would would pull our focus away from who
[2:12:57] Jesus is because it's in who he is as to
[2:13:01] who we are man it's because of his
[2:13:06] atonement it's the reason we can stand
[2:13:09] where we stand a man we cannot turn from
[2:13:13] the good news of our resurrected Lord
[2:13:15] that good news of a resurrected Christ
[2:13:18] says it because I live you shall live
[2:13:20] also John 14:12 said the words that I do
[2:13:24] will identify you and the works that I
[2:13:28] do you son do all so I took by a church
[2:13:31] today on the way not picking on them you
[2:13:34] know I'm trying to not try to go with
[2:13:36] them as far as I can understand but it
[2:13:39] was a church said and they put a sign we
[2:13:41] preach Christ and him crucified well
[2:13:44] that's the problem as we're preaching
[2:13:46] and dead Christ we're preaching Christ
[2:13:52] and him dead and I say that's the fault
[2:13:56] that's the problem
[2:13:58] oh man that's the crux of the matter I
[2:14:01] want to declare today
[2:14:05] he was crucified these are living Christ
[2:14:13] I'm not preaching this they crucified
[2:14:15] Christ but I'm preaching a resurrected
[2:14:18] Christ a living Christ with a living
[2:14:21] faith and a fate that prevails and
[2:14:25] that's what our focus has got to be on a
[2:14:30] prevailing faith a faith that will
[2:14:36] overcome in the worst of crisis of faith
[2:14:41] that will overcome when everybody around
[2:14:45] you falls when the contemporaries around
[2:14:50] you are in every kind of evil thing and
[2:14:53] yet you keep living
[2:14:57] why because I live by the faith of the
[2:15:03] Son of God who loved me and gave His
[2:15:07] life for me god bless you that the
[2:15:11] musicians come
[2:15:19] you can find the key for that old song
[2:15:22] we used to sing we should still sing it
[2:15:25] I care not today what tomorrow may bring
[2:15:30] weather sunshine or shadow or rain the
[2:15:35] Lord that I know he rule is over
[2:15:37] everything and it's useless to worry all
[2:15:45] my worries in vain
[2:15:48] [Music]
[2:15:50] how many wants to be a church today that
[2:15:53] lives by faith the just shall live by
[2:15:58] faith I'm crucified with Christ
[2:16:04] nevertheless I live yet not i but I live
[2:16:08] by the faith of the Son of God who loved
[2:16:13] me and gave his life for me
[2:16:15] Amen let's stand together I care not
[2:16:19] today what the morrow may bring your
[2:16:24] shadow or sunshine or rain
[2:16:29] the Lord I know ruler or
[2:16:33] everything and all of the worry is back
