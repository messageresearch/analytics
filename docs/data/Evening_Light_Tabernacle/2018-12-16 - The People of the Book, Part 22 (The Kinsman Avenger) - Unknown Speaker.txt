a present God to meet that man if you're the Bride of Christ don't be afraid to step forward say Lord this is what I need from you this morning as we all stand together as brother team comes whatever that need is whether it's physical spiritual maybe a loved one just come to the Lord there's nothing between and say father I come before you bodily Lord she told me to do it and Here I am [Music] yes [Music] this is our heads together or Jesus today as we bow before your throne of grace we thank you for mercy we thank you that your mercies aren't new every morning and today is a day full of new mercies and we believe as you would tell the Apostle Paul that your grace is sufficient for us just to have your favor Lord that's sufficient Lord we thank you for that grace upon our lives in that grace has provided salvation Lord salvation of our souls salvation for our bodies and a promise for the redemption the salvation the complete salvation of our bodies will be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and Lord no matter how many different ways that you we see you manifest yourself nor do spiritual applications of that we still look forward to that corporal return because there is nothing there is nothing that can be a substitute for that Lord we look today for this new morning may this be the day that the dead in Christ rise may this be the day that we see our loved ones that are changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye may this be the day Lord that is maybe just another ordinary day but becomes a very supernatural day as supernatural things begin to happen and Lord if this is not the day for that and still then we wait patiently for that coming with our hearts fervent and believing but Lord today in this service we know we can ask for this that there would just be another handful on purpose that you would drop among us until the day that we receive our full and complete Redemption Lord we look to that today and ask that the Angels Lord would just come among walk these pews and drop in front of every believer ever believed in child even those that are struggling with unbelief Lord thinking of their own unworthiness morn Lord may they today just see right dropped in from the mahem full on purpose of the grace of God moving in their lives we ask it in Jesus name amen amen god bless you man what a joy it is to serve the Lord today amen and be in the presence of the great King of glory amen good to be in the house of the Lord and see each one that has assembled with us we just prayed the Lord's blessings upon your life and in a very wonderful way today I just going to let you have your seats this for a moment as you know many times in long life's journey we we will turn into new pages into our book of life and there's a a couple of individuals today that have turned a new page in their book of life and they have decided to join one another in holy matrimony and to go forward together and I'm going to ask that couple to come here today brother mica and sister Amy bless you they plan a wedding in the coming spring well and I think that's good and appropriate spring weddings ISM is a renewal and we just pray Lord for a great renewal in their life as they face this the wonderful moment that's laying out in the future for them may their future be bright and glorious amen god bless you and congratulations to you both god bless you amen it's wonderful when we see our young people and you know to to grow up in the church and then find their their mates and be a part of the assembly here and we love brother Micah he's been a real gentleman real servant of the Lord and sister Amy we know her testimony as well and what a what a wonderful couple amen we certainly think thank the Lord for them amen now we of course still have our brother Amos layin there and of course the doctors their report is they give him really no hope I present chance of surviving and but of course we know believers can't die right we know that and so we of course are as believers we always do what the Word of God says and that is we just keep praying and believing and expecting until God tells us no and then if he says no well then we like it we love his nose as well as we do his yeses a man and so right now it is you know as it was with Abraham against hope he believed in hope so you know there was no hope for Abraham he was past age as white past age but he just kept testifying and given glory to God and and so we today we continue just given God the glory God prays in everything even that the Lord takes away well then blessed be the name of the Lord we can't lose we're winners either way amen and so our brother name is just think about it last Wednesday night here standing on his feet rejoicing and just you know now just right close to the very edge of crossing over and and we don't know from one time to the next you know just even from one service to the next you know what will happen or what kind of curves that lives life will bring but you know the main thing of it is is we be prepared to meet the Lord and we also need to realize the how precious one another is and to make every moment that we have together count you know when when you come to moment like this little doctrinal differences they don't make any difference you know little ideas a little feeler all of that all is gone you know now you focus on what's important why don't we just do that to begin with Amen just instead of waiting for a moment like this let's just focus right now on what's important a man and each one of you are important to him and a man god bless you it's good to be together this morning let's stand as we read the word I'm gonna get right into the message this morning we got lots of things going on today and just just trust the Lord will speak to you in a very very positive way and cause our minds to turn upon him numbers chapter 35 and verse 9 and and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speaking to the children of Israel and say unto them when you become over Jordan into the land of Canaan then you shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you that the Slayer may flee thither which killeth any persons at unawares and they shall be under you cities for refuge from the Avenger that they men's lair die not until he stand before the congregation in judgment and of these cities which he shall give six cities shall how you have for refuge and and ye shall give three cities on this side of Jordan and three cities shall you give in the land of Canaan which shall be cities of refuge and these six cities shall be a refuge both for the children of Israel and for the stranger and for the Sojourner among them that everyone that killeth any person unawares may flee thither and if he smite him with an instrument of iron so that he die he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death and if he's might him with throwing a stone wherewith he may die and he die he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death or if he smite him with a hand weapon of wood wherewith he may die and he die he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death the revenger of blood himself shall slay the murder when he meeteth him he shall slay him but if he thrust him of hatred or hurl at him by laying of weight that he die or in enmity smite him with his hand that he die he that smote him shall surely be put to death for he is a murderer the revenger of blood shall slay the murder when he meeteth him but if he thrust him suddenly without enmity and have cast upon him anything without layin of weight or with any stone wherewith a man may die seeing him not and cast it upon him that he died and was not his enemy neither sought his harm then the congregation shall judge between the Slayer and The Revenge of blood according to these judgments and the congregation shall deliver the Slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge whether he was fled and he shall abide in it until the death of the high priest which was anointed with the holy oil but if the Slayer shall at any term come without the border of the city of his refuse whether he was fled and the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of refuge and a revenger of blood killed the Slayer he shall not be guilty of blood because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priests but after the death of the high priest the Slayer shall return into the land of his possession so these things shall be for a statute of judgement unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings a man god bless you can take your seats we're going to speak this morning on the kinsman avenger the law of Reaper retribution is also called the law of retaliation it was a part of the Old Testament law that was given to Israel by Moses retribution was one of the cornerstones of israel's penal code and the punishment was always to mirror the crime the principle of the law is is found and you can look at it at a later time in Leviticus 24 that it basically says anyone who injures their neighbor is to be injured in the same manner fracture for fracture i for eye tooth for tooth the one who has inflicted the injury must must suffer the same injury and it even went right down to the livestock that was on their farms or the property that they owned such as animals whoever killed an animal had to make restitution but whoever would kill another human being was to be put to death and of course um you know under this penal code that would be monetary damages that would be paid for killing an animal belonging to someone else but like we said if a person is murdered then the murderer must forfeit his life in return so it was I 494 tooth life for life nights and Israel part of the law enforcement fell upon the family of the murder victim because they didn't have a police force in that ancient time so kids a kinship posses were were called on to enforce the law and so according to what we read in numbers that in some cases the Avenger of blood which would be the next of kin would be charged with carrying out the death sentence and even sometimes tracking down the murderer if the murder had fled so this is why that God would put into Israel these cities of refuge because there would be a place where the offender who had killed someone would run to this city and then it would be judged by the judges of that city and and find out if it was murder or manslaughter if it was just simply an accidental slaying well he can his life could be spared as long as he lived in that city if he was an intentional murderer had a nod in his heart and this could be proven that he had intentionally murdered his fellow brother within the Kinsmen would then put him to death without mercy now so the near kinsman had a righteous charge I want you to get this this this was a part of their honor the part of their the charge that they had as being a kinsman and that righteous charge would be to avenge I repay vengeance for harm done to his kin or it would even include redeeming his fellow brother from slavery or even the land that he had lost to buy it back and to bring a restoration now in order for there to be redemption redemption has to begin with a loss all right so looking at the Old Testament law on the new near kinsman and and that he would many times if he had the wealth and was willing to do so he could pay for that unfortunate kin that had fallen so far into poverty and and and been sold as a slave and and so he would redeem him and and also his property even though he had lost it all that God provided in his law a way that the Lamb could not be sold forever and even he was not to be sold forever but he provided a way for redemption now of course this all looked back to the Garden of Eden where a man lost and he lost his possession he was king of the earth he was lord over the earth and the earth was for him to subdue and to maintain and to make into a Garden of Eden and God would look back all the way to Eden and and know that even though his son was lost that that would have to come a next-of-kin to provide a redeemer to redeem man from the horrible fall in the slavery under sin now of course with Israel the Lord promised that his people would obey the commands of the Covenant they would retain the land and that never again would they be captives or slaves to another nation as he had been down in Egypt and the land itself would be to them a daily reminder of the freedom and the blessings that God had bestowed on them and the continued possession over each family's allotted portion of land was really really important in that day to maintain their social structure so that God would then he would see to it that there were laws that were set into place so that no family could permanently lose their land forever I think this is should be a very heartening to us today that no matter how long it's been we already know that the kinsman is at work to bring us back to where we fell from and that he's very conscious of this now and because it is his honor it is his righteousness which compels him to do this now the Hebrew word for this kinsman redeemer would be called the go el which means to redeem to act as kinsman redeemer to avenge revenge to to to ransom to do his part is a kinsman and as a next to kin act as a kinsman redeemer and in the case of Ruth that we spoke on last time you know was he where there would bow as being the near kinsman would marry his his brothers are his relatives Widow to beget a child for him in order to restore and keep that land in the family name and and to have an inheritance it would also make reasons to redeem from slavery to redeem land and then to finally to exact vengeance now we know that mankind was lost and he needed redemption and redemption is the purchase of that which has been lost or sold into slavery this is why he come to say the son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost so that which was lost from him that which was his in the beginning is why that he came in order to be a kinsman to seek and to save that which was lost now so um you know in the Exodus we remember that in the Old Testament there the blood of the Lamb would purchase or redeem the life of the firstborn Hebrew children and and delivered Israel from bondage down in in Egypt and of course it was it was foreshadowing and telling of a greater lamb that would come and this Lamb of God would purchase us with his own blood from the bondage of sin and death and delivered us to a new spiritual life in him so the the the lamb symbolically represented the Redeemer and his work as kinsman and so when we see the book of Revelation and it protray ins symbolically the different symbols it it would represent this whole story of redemption by showing a lamb a lamb that had been slain and this lamb would would symbolically represent the kinsman redeemer and his work now remember as I said when we look in Revelation 4 and 5 and these are not these are not a moment twinkling eye events these are events that begins with one sitting on the throne happened the questioned book in hand then the call for a kinsman and that and then there to do that the one on the throne would have to become the lamb a man and paid the price of redemption and then he would be slain and there intercede and then he would go forth and he would take the question book of title in order to restore that which was lost back to mankind and finally it would conclude with all creation worshiping God now so the book of Revelation four treys how that he would come and would take on flesh you know God had said the soul that sinneth it shall die so there was a death sentence that was passed over all of us and the end um and it's he said that soul is separated from me and I'm just gonna share some quotations from the church age book and you know that I'm sharing this from the church's book and you can go back and look at it um where brother Branham would talk about this on page 136 and I'll just share this pardon we won't show it on the screen this morning but you know God looked down and declared the soul that sinneth it shall die it is separated from me it can't approach son to me we know that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God that meant all died and all were separated and one day a time would come that when even that bit of life would be snuffed out and it would be all over but God in love hallelujah took an animal and took his life and the place of the sinners life so you go right back and you see the first thing when man sinned it required the taking of another life life for life hey man so in the Old Testament the sinner would bring a lamb and he would place hidden hand of the lamb or his hand on the lamb while the priest cut the lambs throat and he felt the bleeding and they heard the bleeding felt the body stiffen and death and he saw the smoke of the sprinkled blood as send to God and he knew that that lamb had taken his place he knew that the Lambs life had been forfeited for his but the life of that lamb was animal life and it could not come back up on the sinner making him clean so he left with the same desire to sin and he would go out with sin in his mind and would come back with a sacrifice for the same thing a year later but in the New Testament it is not so hallelujah our dine lamb is the son of God who gave his blood as a ransom for many by faith now listen to this church you see by faith we walk up and place our hands upon that land and we see him with his bloody wounds and the lacerated back the cruel thorns carried his brow we feel his pain and hear him cry my God my God why hast thou forsaken me and what happened to life that left that broken blood cell came back upon the repented one and that life that was in him came back upon us and we go back with no more desire to sin and we now possess a hatred for the works and the lusts of the flesh now let me just say to you if what is being preached does not result in that kind of as experience if your doctrine or your faith doesn't allow you to walk up and put your hands of all that Lamb amen and see his bloody wounds and his lacerated back and the cruel thorns in his tearing his brow if your faith doesn't allow you to touch a high priest with a bloody sacrifice but just acquaint you with a doctrine you're just offering in a bloodless sacrifice hey man this is this is a this is just a cane offering the Bloodless worship this is why that you know that people today are filled with such murder in their hearts and they try to kill those who really do worship in the spirit this is why the murder spirit is in the hearts of some men who wants to take away inspirational songs that bring people back to the heart of worship and when the heart of worship should be about a love relation with Jesus Christ hey man it's a if your faith doesn't take you first to Calvary hey man let me day any revelation that's what I'm calling faith if your revelation if this great mystery doesn't take you first to Calvary where you're crucified on the cross with your sacrifice until sin nature is dead you'll always be like King and then attracted murdered those who have spiritual worship now this is why there's no miracles in the churches this is why the signs don't follow them that believe they believe in a lie they're worshipping under a bloodless worship even the foolish virgins brother Evan said they go through the tribulation because they think they're under the blood but they're not but I'll tell you what we want we want blood in our worship a man what is the blood it's the spirit it's the life that was in the blood and we want we wanted to float down and cleanse it and take starchiness out of us and unbelief out of us and put a real worship back to God we're the holy life with a dedicated life hey man now it's the evil of denomination that offers atonement without blood remember this we must have blood with our atonement nothing else will do it and as I said you can have a doctor you can have the great mysteries you can know many many things about the Bible but until your revelation brings you to the point what that you see a bloody sacrifice when you lay your hands upon him and your sins are transmitted from you to him and his righteousness flows back to you all of your great revelation is in vain it's just a Cain offering now in the Sermon smyrnaean church eh brother batam explains about that blood cell he said look at us he said what is our life just one little sale that came from our Father the female doesn't have the hemoglobin she produces eggs he's an incubator but the blood comes from the male that's why the woman takes the man's name the children take his name the mother is the incubator for the children she bears him and this is what has happened for our Redemption the Holy Ghost came upon Mary and she bore a son and called him Jesus the Great Creator came down and became a sacrifice for our sin his blood was the blood of God happens with me this morning man that's exactly what it was that blood of God was shed and the spirit left him as he died in agony then the same life spirit came back to indwell the repented sinner and set him free and that sinner did not have to come back year after year sacrifice have to sacrifice but there was no knee but by one sacrifice once overall he has been set free from the Dominion of sin and has received the life of Christ whereby he raised in victory over sin the world the flesh and the devil Oh glory to God I'm glad to be speaking to a victorious church this loony God did it he did it all he cried out to the world Kirsten sealed I will give you a side of birds and sabira child a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and this will be your sign it will be an everlasting sign what she brings forth will be Immanuel God with us hallelujah God came down in a blood cells don't you ever forget this don't you ever forget how he became kin to you God came down in a blood cell not through man but by the Holy Ghost and in that birds in womb in that virgin womb a tabernacle for the purpose of death was built the seed of the woman came in order that he be bruised to bring us our salvation and when the Holy Ghost came upon Mary he created within her womb the cell that would multiply and become the body of our Lord and that cell was created it was the beginning of the creation of God that's who Jesus is and that Holy One was filled with holy blood even the blood of God the tabernacle came to birth he grew to a man he went to Jordan and there that sacrifice was lost of John in the river court called Jordan and when that acceptable sacrifice rose up out of the water God came and dwelt him filling him with the spirit without measure and when he died and shed his blood the perfect life of God was liberated to come back upon the sinner who would accept Christ as his Savior amen what a wonderful plan oh how striking it is Jehovah born crying over a manure pile Jehovah born in a manger of straw that's your everlasting sign to the proud and puffed up pseudo-intellectuals that have evolved their own theology and denied the truth of God Jehovah God a crying baby in chicken barn and then we think we have a right to be proud holding up our noses criticizing and acting as though we're somebody here's your real sign this is the right one jehovah playing as a boy jehovah working in a carpenter shop jehovah watching the feed of fishermen I'll give you a sign said God not the sign of a white colored priesthood not the sign of wealth and power but there's nothing in a sign you would or think is suitable but it is an everlasting sign it's the greatest sign of all Jehovah standing in the courtyard bruised and bleeding with thorns on his brow and spit on his face and locked and said it not Jehovah despised and rejected hanging naked upon the cross while hypocrites jeered and dared him to come down off the cross Jehovah dying to over prayin and nothing happening did you over died that is the sign for all men now there's not another like it it's the great one hallelu you may not be our banner may that be the everlasting sign we're under today Amen is that we have a sacrifice Amen yeah we we may have faults and we may have failures there may be sickness in our body that may be diseases that come but we have a sacrifice we have an atonement we have someone we can go and lay hands upon it hallelujah receive of those virtuous that's what our revelation ought to include this morning here not include that righteous one who laid down his life so we could become righteous then he said after his death and darkness came on the earth they put him in a tomb there he laid there three days and nights until an earthquake shattered the gloom of night and he came forth jehovah came forth jehovah send it on high then Jehovah return to in flawless Church amen to hold him back with a rushing mighty wind that flames of fire Jehovah came back to walk in the midst of his church and empower his people once more Jehovah came and this time to stay in his people and man again again Jehovah heals the sick raises the dead manifests himself by the spirit Jehovah came back speaking in tongues and given the answer back an interpretation Jehovah came down oh don't you remember when he came down to you and a man Jehovah came down and he raised the prostitute to sin no more he came down to the drunkard with flat blows on his face as he lay unconscious in the gutter yester OVA came to manifest in the flesh and manifest through flesh Jehovah came God in us the hope of glory yes Jesus came and said his blood led the captives free he came and redeemed his lost sheep he gave them eternal life and they will never perish he will not lose a one of them but will raise him up at the last day hallelujah the second death cannot hurt them and then it has no power it has no power over them but they are the Lambs and they follow him wherever he goes hey man all aren't you glad you belong to the lamb and get ready to switch programs for me man now notice here hid it was God came down to dwell in flash among us it was God that would come to becoming kinfolks to take away our sins and at the redeeming church he took the death that we could not pay and that he did not make that we had foolishly done and a wasted life and wasted years and he took it there and paid your sin debt I say what a savior that is what a kinsman that is that God would come down among us hey ma'am oh that's not something of 2,000 years ago he's right here in this people this morning Tuoba coming down to heal the sick to raise the dead to confirm his word one more time this is our God now there's a question book when we seem in Revelation 5 coming down to this question book and he comes to claim the book but to claim the book is only begin the beginning releasing seals is is only given faith revelation to his people that this book is theirs it's all a process of his Redemption it is not the ceasing of redemption it is the continuation of redemption it isn't that redemption is over it is that redemption is being finalized a man being fulfilled now brother Branham would say in the breech he hasn't claimed it yet you see he hadn't claimed it see if he took the book of Redemption everything that Adam had and everything that he lost Christ redeems back and he's already redeemed us were needy redeem us at the cross by one offering he paid for all the sins of all the seven ages he redeemed us the cross is that right buddy hasn't taken possession yet hey man oh no take it even the book is not him taking possession it is only taking possession of its title and his claim for redemption all right now he cannot notice he cannot what's his words now he hasn't taken really hasn't taken possession yet he cannot until the time appointed so there's a time appointed he's going to take possession hey man but notice when it happens then we'll come the resurrection and then the earth will be renewed again that's for the millennial reign and then he will take the possession his possession which he got when he redeemed us but we'll do it at the appointed time so the appointed time includes the resurrection it includes the rapture of the church it includes even renewing the earth a man a man and then he will take possession of the earth and be the king of the earth and I word that the first matter man Adam lost the kingship of the earth the second man Adam will regain the kingship of the earth he'll take control now because why of his redeeming works so he will claim in his claim at work he will claim both the living and the dead hallelujah aim at the living and the dead so the claiming work isn't over until the resurrection hallelujah amen sue so you see it's all a part of his great work as kinsman redeemer this is his process this is what he's doing now a man finishing up Redemption given faith to the elect getting them ready for a resurrection that's what this message how to do for you it ought to get you ready for a resurrection hey man now we're going to look at revelation 5 and 6 when the call rang out for a man who was worthy it's a lamb that stepped forth why because God became a man the kinsman to purchase us with his own blood so if you look here in Revelation 5 and and any and he tells us in Revelation 5 and and 6 and behar beheld and lo in the midst of the throne in the end of the four beasts and the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes notice he was a lamb stood a lamb I want you to notice this a lamb step forth this is not a lion he's not coming as a king he is coming as an Assessor he has to take the book as an intercessor as a kinsman redeemer yes he is lying he is a king but he's not yet king of the earth he is our king he's king of saints and we have a kingdom and that kingdom is within us it's not of this world come on somebody a man says not an earthly Kingdom yet but there's going to be an earthly Kingdom and everything that can be seeking is going to be shaken oh yeah he had it was a lamb as it had been slain so notice what took the book it would be the lamb taking the book now he is not changing roles he hears he is in the process of becoming king of the earth but he first has got to do and finish his work of kinsmen before he reigns on the earth he's got to do the role of kinsman-redeemer and that also includes the role of kinsman avenger now so we see in verse eight and when she the lamb had taken the book the four beasts and the four twenty elders now that four and twenty elders represents the entire bride of old and new testament the twelve patriarchs representing Israel the Twelve Apostles representing the bride the church come on and there they fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of the Saints why is this they had been praying all of these years for his coming for the resurrection and here they hold them and then they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals for that was slain and has redeemed us to God by blood I want you to understand that book is redeemed by blood the people of the book I redeemed by blood it took blood to redeem us no other price could do it a mound nothing less than the blood of God and here God would become the kinfolk in order to make a bring a blood that could make a proper atonement because the blood of bulls and goats could never take away sin now so you have redeemed us by thy blood out of every kindred tongue that's nation and people and nation notice from all languages people and nations and it would tell us in verse 12 that the lamb is the limit is worthy notice they are not singing worthy is the king or worthy is the lion because they're not crowning him as king the crowning of him as king of kings and Lord of lords a place until the dead to Revelation 19 and man will do when he comes back with his saints are you with me then he comes back as a crown king taking over the earth but right now he's not king of the earth a man Satan is the Prince of the power of atmospheres he is the prince of this world he is the god of this evil age he is the Satan is the one that is worship here except by a few of us thank God we got a different God than Satan hey ma'am but notice he is our King but notice they're not saying worthy is the king who were thee is the lion but they're saying worthy is the lamb and it's the Lamb that was slain and he's worthy to receive power riches wisdom strength honor glory and blessing he is unworthy to receive the kingship he is the man worthy to pick up where Adam he is a man worthy to become the king of the earth but he does this he does this as the lamb in order to do to become king he has to become kinsmen and without becoming kinsmen he can't take possession of the earth now notice he is king but he hasn't taken the millennial throne yet revelation 5:13 this this process of redemption continues in this scene and remember this is a scene of his Redemption and the na8 continues until every creature which is in heaven on the earth under the earth such as I'm to see and all that are in the heard I sayin blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and upon the lamb for ever and ever then the four beasts said amen and the four living four and twenty elders fell down and worship Him that liveth for ever and ever notice this so we can see here that it continues to all creation worships and the groaning for the earth is over with and as long as the world is in a groaning condition are you with me under the reign of Satan there under the groaning condition and as long as they're under a groaning condition that then he's not king over the earth yet but when he comes all the groaning will be over and it will all turn to a worship and all creation will worship it will cease his groaning the trees will quit dying the animals will cook killing each other the lion will lay down by the lamp the King was said about his throne with his bride and together man will rule the earth for a thousand years hallelujah oh my I think he you know John when he wants this brother branham thought he got so carried away told everybody everything even though I was in the sea was hearing John say it because he can just imagine himself being there hallelujah he can imagine himself being placed there what would I do I'll ask you what would you do when all the groaning is over what callus shouting are we gonna do what kind of praise is gonna go forth what kind of worship you think we get a little wild here hey man wait till we step there oh well I dance for you Jesus I don't know we'll run around while I shot what I'm kneel down I'll probably do it all hey man when I make him the king of this earth when his Saints shall crown him lord over all no I want you to see revelation 6:1 it is the lamb that opened the seals it was not him doing it as king as king he held the question title deed but the earth was made for man in order for for it to come to back to his rightful owner then God would have to become a man and this lamb is representing his kinsmen work now remember he is not I will alam he's not this funny-looking odd-looking thing with seven horns seven eyes and he's not some weird-looking creature with wool on him and hooves there and he walks up there standing there with his wit on his back hooves and taking his front hooves and and then taking the book that's not him it's only symbolic of when the King laid aside his majesty and his ropes and robed himself in a pauper's robe like ours one that could have a headache one that could get sick one that could die one that could bear you infirmities one that he could be tempted in a man where he could face everything you face as a kinsman as what have you and this lamb is representing his kinsman redeemer work this is what he did to become one of you when you couldn't become God and you couldn't go up to heaven heaven came down to you aren't you glad heaven opened for you arching up God descended a man he didn't send a second person or third person he came himself created a body in the womb of Mary and stepped into that body Jesus who says not me that does this work as a human I can't do this but it's my father that dwells in me it's a turtle spirit that has come to Tabernacle of man there's nobody else could ever say that did you hear me and then there was nobody else could ever say that a man ray was in all the fullness of God dwelt in him a man notice notice now as we look but he's not just the kids 'men Redeemer he is also sins man Avenger now I want to show you here in revelation 6 16 and he's in the end this is in the sixth seal and they said to the mountains and the rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the what wrath the wrath of the Lamb now you know many times we get two we get a picture of the Lamb and in being just a little meek lowly little little baby and like a goat kid or a suckling lamb in your arms and they can be so gentle and so sweet but this is not portraying a gentle lamp this is per Dib this is showing the wrap and this lamb this Ram has seven arms are you with me amen and this how many has ever heard of a battering ram well because you know we think of many times of a lamb being defenseless and certainly Jesus laid down his he was he went before the shearers is dumb he portrayed all the part of the innocence II and the meekness and the loneliness and the submissiveness and the dying and the bleeding and the cried the man despised and rejected he pro trade all of that but here is not that same portrayal this is the other side of the RAM are you with me and this is he's got rats now you know if you know you you have that different animals however ever animal can defend its its its babies in its own ways maybe some have long legs and they together can outrun their the Predators and they have different ways but you know we're there with a goat with a goat would you walk into the hill where a goat ears were a bucky as' he won't he won't get up on his back hoods he will come up and bring his head up like this and he'll bend it down and ran with his whole body force knock you to the ground that's a goat but a ram his own no defenseless animal when old Ram comes let's say he weighs 300 pounds he's got his horns and when he is threatened and his flock is threatened and I in fact of the matter is many Shepherds have to actually put a blinder only on the Rams on their very heads to keep them from seeing a head they can only see sideways that way you know when they they run they're only running this way and and the cake get a good aim because when a Rama comes at you and there have been a many a farmer that has been hurt by his own Rams but they won't put their head down and run with her full force right toward their target and bama with their 300-pound force and bam and bam and bam until they shattered their enemy so what the battering ram was far it was taking a big-block head of a of a log and manma eight or ten men get on it back up and run forward and with all of their weight and force ram ram and ram and hit that gate until it would be crushed well let me tell you the wrath of the Lamb is no small thing to deal with well he gets that to you when this kinsman gets him on a trail they nothing gonna stop him because ain't no binders on this one Amen he's got seven eyes seven horns oh he comes with his whole full power the wrath of the Lamb and it's in the tribulation he still lamb notice he still lamb but he's Adventure he's changing roles hey man he's going to start avenging bringing revenge of honor those who know not God who have despised his word who have rejected him who have persecuted his Saints are you with me he's the kinsman and let me just tell you friends let me just tell you your enemy the devil has no chance against him hey man wonder when the lamb releases his wrath things begin to happen here with me now hey man that's what we're wanting today the wrath of the lamb on our enemies upon our sickness upon the plague upon the things that is troubling our brothers or sisters or whatever we want that wrath of the lamb to come against our enemy now this dish would be called the revenger a bud remember numbers 35 20 but if he thrust him with hatred or hurled at him of by by laying it weighed on that he died or or in enmity strike him or smite him with his hand that he died he that smote him shall surely be put to death for he's a murderer the revenger blood shall slay the murder when he meeteth him is somebody with me now a man the revenger of blood this is what is called this is also girl kinsman redeemer that kinsman redeemer is also no revenge our blood shall slay the murderer well the murderer Satan through mankind and enslaved him back many years ago but I tell you the process of redemption oh brother there's many kinsmen on his trail egg man that will all go take him Manny doing so will restore you will buy back the property will buy you out of slavery come on somebody but he's also gonna be after your enemy hallelujah Satan there's a kinsman on your trail this morning [Applause] hallelujah now and let me just tell you Satan there's no city of refuge for you he knows every time you put out an eye he knows every time you put a cancer on God's people he knows every time you plant them with a brain bleed with this situation or this sin or this problem and it's hard for now and it's too far to it's his honor to take your battle own that you can't fight Christ our kinsmen is on the trail of that murderer and he'll get him man let me read you let me tell you about his plans he'll get him and he's gonna bind him for a thousand years and then and then he's gonna let him loose for just a little while there and bring him to judgment and when he brings him to judgment he will finally cast him into a lake of fire and everything that you did to you will be retributive back to him one day you'll be able to look down in that pit and say is that the thing that bothered me hey man is that the worm is doctor the lowdown skunk of a nothing look at him and you will be able to rejoice and laugh because you had a kinsman because a redeemer Rick team to the revenger of blood and let me die he has no place to hide [Music] now let me read Bible for you second Thessalonians one-in-six seeing it is a righteous thing what's now what's the wording here a righteous thing you see the work of a kinsman is his own righteousness these are my kinfolk and it's my own righteousness it's it's it's why it's my honor I mean it's a righteous thing with God to recompense that means to payback tribulation to them that trouble you what do you think the earth is going to go through three and a half years of tribulations come on somebody why you're why are they gonna go through three and a half years of tribulation cause God's gonna be paying back amen brother it ain't gonna be no picnic for the devil it ain't gonna be no wonderful Kingdom they will howl they will cry they will cry for the rocks and the mountain because of the wrath of the Lamb amen Satan will be judged though the church system will be judged the Beast will be judged just don't be there hey man cuz there's gonna be an awful time the earth is gonna is about to go that some of the worst calamities has ever went through we're on the border right now seeing pre-tribulation plagues already coming we're right on the border of it all taking place hey man but he said glob of paper tribulation to them that trouble you and to you who are troubled rest the man what was root doing her stage before he took possession before he took her as his bride and took her in now you say old brother Tim he's already taken the system right no he's in the process when he takes his bride he's taking her to the marriage supper are you with me but right now he's just called her out to himself now so but but right now we are in the resting stage remember Ruth deciding and Ruth working and then finally Ruth rusting and then finally Ruth rewarded amen and our reward is going to get a new home a new body and when we see I'm not going home in this world anymore I don't know about you but I'm talking about this thing too I'm not at home in this anymore but a minute don't mind me the way it used to it hurts me it groans it there's travail then this old house is in decay is it shudders needs repair it's his roof is getting thin on top hey man this weather and in turning gray here it is you know didn't this is this is on this old house but all brother he's gonna recompense trouble to those who had troubled us hey man listen he said rest with us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels hallelujah he said while he house had been revealed with mighty angels yes he revealed himself with mighty angels where in him in Abraham's day he revealed himself with mighty angels in Elijah's day he revealed himself in with mighty angels somebody follow me a man in Jesus day he revealed himself with mighty angels and in our day but he's going to reveal himself with mighty angels and when he does it's gonna be with flaming fire taking vengeance so he's been revealed in many matters but this revelation hasn't fully come yet because he will take vengeance on them that know not God and obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power so this God I want you to see it back first one I've got six rather it's a righteous thing with God this is God's righteousness and work to recompense vengeance now let's just go back to the early scriptures in Deuteronomy 32 and verse 43 let's just see what he says how he places God as the adventure rejoice all you nations with his people for he will avenge the blood of his servants he will do the work of kinsmen as a venture the blood of his service and will render vengeance to his adversary and will be merciful that means he will atone unto his land and to his people that same word is translated as merciful is translated as atonement and many other passages of the scriptures so it's the same thing if he atones his mercy hey man and brother Brendan said never say mercy is over and so we can say mercy is not over never say it then we should never say atonement is over all right Amen but notice he will rejoice o nation with his people for he will avenge the blood of his servants and will render vengeance to his adversaries and will be merciful in other words he will atone unto his land and to his people so you see he brings atonement and vengeance hey man now let's go back to that scripture that I love so much in Isaiah 59 and he saw that there was no man now we already get a clue here in order to be an intercessor he's gonna have to be a man he didn't see that there was no God he saw there was no man he saw there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor so when he looked and he saw the plight of man and he sees there's no man that can redeem them there is no man that can avenge them there's no man that can buy him out of sin slavery therefore his arm brought salvation unto Him amen and his righteousness it's sustained him so therefore that was something when out of God that reach all the way down to the earth remember his arm is not short that he cannot save a man a man who has believed our report to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed and the arm of the Lord is when he comes in his power and here in this case he's taking off human for us so his arm that was there there there was a there was something comes out of God to bring salvation and his righteousness sustained and that word sustained it means upheld him in other words it caused him to do it it wasn't that he had to do it but his righteousness for him to be a righteous God it made him step out it's my honor its my righteousness to do this I gotta do it these are my people that's what my creation lost and they sold him out under a under even Adams foolishness but I'm coming down and taking on their foolishness taking a death I didn't know a man paying the debt that they could not pay and he put on righteousness as a breastplate so you see his right sistahs caused him to do it and here he puts on a breastplate a helmet of salvation upon his head and he puts a garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with zeal as a cloak now wait a minute let's go back to let's see Abraham just a moment here's a here is Abraham and Abraham and has a big church I don't know how many there are but even after the split they had 300 men so they have a pretty big church right you know somebody said here the other day said you know they asked why don't you go to evening lights oh well it's it's too big and God a God dumb-dumb God won't be it with big people or big churches well Abraham's group was 300 plus men and some children women and children and so you know it's one excuse or another right people make up every kind of reasons why they can't come to church why they can't be a part of the work of God I'll tell you stand before they judge one day and tell him this standing before the judge one day and tell him well I'll tell you I didn't like that song they sang stand before they're the righteous judge and say the reason why I didn't support the word of the work of God was because a little petty differences splitting hairs all of your excuses are going to be puny I meant when you stand there on that day and you find all these reasons why and God asks why a man really puts a microscope on people's motives and see it really is because of a backslidden sinful heart don't hang up on me and don't shut off the internet because I'm talking to you now he put on righteousness as a breastplate helmet upon his head look at him dressing this is exactly what Abraham did Abraham had his brother lot that he had coming along his nephew lot they treated him like a son before he had a son sojourned together shared a revelation together sad and sweet harmony together hey man but you know when it seemed to be a delay on receiving the promised son lot got impatient and began to stray away and drift it down to Sodom well down in Sodom of course he wasn't under the blessings of Abraham so he gets out from under the blessings of Abraham and is down in Sodom and there's a there's a the kid the other Kings that comes up against the king of Sodom takes him all away and stems here lot you can imagine you imagine that as he's walking down his hands behind him stripped down maybe nothing even his good clothes taken off of him his daughters there along with him and his wife and he looks back at her I told you we should have stayed with Abraham gets home down you know their walk in the home being beat hurry that dong the way but you see different from everybody else Locke had a kinsman and that reached the Kinsmen seals that you that that Sodom has been taken and your net here is in captivity and he didn't spare a moment it was his righteousness that cinammon a trail and he goes running now he he Gerdes himself I can see he puts on her righteousness as a breastplate a helmet of salvation on his head a garment of vengeance for clothing and clad with zeal as a cloak and here all night long he runs he goes through and he's attacked and again he slaughters the kings and he brings back his nephew that restores him and all his goods why is he he's a Katzman what was acting in Abraham the Redeemer the Redeemer that would come so now according to their deeds according he will accordingly he will reap a fury to his adversaries recompense to his enemies to the islands he will pay recompense listen when we couldn't do it when we could not defend ourselves when we were in since prison already there was one beginning to work and he be said unto us a son is born unto us a child is given and his name shall be called wonderful and his enemy counselor the mighty God what the mighty God and that word means the warrior God that God would become human a son would be born and the mighty God would become a warrior God and he would get on the trail of the adversary they meant to first redeem the sons that were lost hey man that's the first stages of redemption redeeming the earth will come later a man but the first stage the redemption is reserved is saving the soul of man and finally redeeming his earth I thought about his body and we're right here on the verge of that a man now notice in doing this it would be glutes out of righteousness if you'll go with me to second Kings nine and seven you so strike the house away have your master that I may avenge now this is God saying I want to avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the servants of the Lord at the hand of Jezebel so God begin to set things in motion to bring it vengeance because I want to bring vengeance it's a righteous thing with him now even when you go over to the souls in the altar even though they're more of and it cannot call them a more distant kin because they're under the Old Covenant and so they're more of a distant kin but nevertheless they're in the book of life their souls in the altar in revelation 6 10 and these souls are crying and I want you to know they know God's obligation to avenge because they now brother Brennan said these are not Christians because he said if they were Christians they would be saying just forgive them Lord that would take the same attitude that Jesus did that Joseph did come on I did this to save life they do this say you know they they would they would um they would forgive their enemy that would pray that there wouldn't be a harm that would be done that you know all of this but these souls are the altar Jews and they're here then they know God's law of retribution and they know God is righteous so they cry with a loud voice saying how long O Lord how holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth so these souls are the answers they know God as a kinsman therefore they're asking him to avenge a man notice they know him as kinsman so they're asking for him they intercede on their behalf vincent's what about us you said why not wait a minute brother Tim Christians don't ask God to punish people but we can ask God to your vengeance of what Satan has done we've got a right hey man if they would say hello mo God how long when we ought to intercede the same way and say hello mo Lord how long how long O Lord how long were you not avenge the blood of your servants how long will god how long will the sick have to lay and not be healed when we got a kinsman redeemer of kinsmen Abids ER Avenger I just said this enemy you promised by your stripes I am healed you promised deliverance hallelujah oh brother I'll tell your friends I want you just to read what Jesus told us to do he gave us the parable of the unjust judge didn't he and he talked about the winner coming to him over and over and saying it feeds me of mine animus restore to me what I lost I've been afflicted and tormented and everything been taken from me buddies but Jesus would give this example of somebody who would pray and not give up and these souls on the altar were praying and not give up till they got a word and that word was said rest a little season and then give you white robes I'm gonna give you some comfort but rest a little season because I've got some things that happen but I will perform my work kinsmen I will punish them that have brought this upon you listen listen because because it reduce don't mean God wasn't going to Vince them God's gonna make the Jews but let me read this scripture and shall not God avenge his own elect I'm thinkin say I'm elect and Selma God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bare along with them I'll tell you oh listen now I tell you these are the words of Jesus a man if we couldn't ought to be a red-letter I tell you that he will avenge them speedily hey man but nevertheless when the Son of man cometh sally find faith on the earth will he find somebody that knows me as kinsman that knows my power of redemption will he find somebody who will stand there crying out come on kinsman come on Redeemer come on my adventure I bench me of my enemy my enemies take it away my children I want my children back then my enemies taking away my health i want my health back hey man that my enemy is taking away my joy I want my joy back I'm gonna tell you shout out God ugh being his own he left which cry day and night under him of people who will not give up our people who will not stop a people who will say brick farm though our kinsmen dear kinsman to me that's what I needed I need a kinsman today I need a kinsman from my sickness a near kinsman for my children for my grandchildren who mouths I need a kinsman for my Baroness I need a kinsman for this barren church around the world oh let the kidsmas step for Oh hallelujah the call the call in this day was for kinsmen why would we cease calling for kinsmen when the elect Kratt day at night to say a fair just do the work chadzmuth I'm sick lord I need you to come the media I can't help myself the children got snatched away and down in sins bondage down in unbelief you know what if the enemy is done be the Avenger I want you to come and avenge you see he don't do that brother till he does his righteousness even though he wasn't the king of the earth he was still king and he still was Palance was full of power and when he walked on the earth demons had to recognize him and everywhere he went he tormented demons told him to go and they went whatever he said they had to do until they begged him oh I tell you this time we get the devil beggin let us alone leave aloud it's not time yet but we're coming close to time it's coming closer that closer that full Redemption hallelujah Jesus made the triple death Jesus within you will make sacred triple now Alleluia that's why you saw the other night right here at this altar when a devil got a hold of one of our young girls there and he had to grow in the name of Jesus Christ even though he was growling and saying I won't come out I'll tell you had to bow to the name of Jesus Christ hey man because I tell you here's our kinsman wasn't me at work that was our kinsman at work one day he'll lay hold of death that works in our body and he'll strip it from its power deaths will have no power and a grave will have no victory redemption of our bodies let me show you a scripture here Romans 8:23 and not only they the Bible said they're all groaning all the earth is groaning so not only they are groaning but ourselves also that it received the firstfruits of the Spirit we ourselves groan within ourselves you know that Ruth would get the firstfruits he would give her six measures of barley he would give her things to sustain her somebody with me now givers who give her something that would stain her and tell her to rest and God has given us not just handfuls on purpose but he's now given us now he's given us what needs to sustain us all the way until we rewarded all I'm already rewarded brother dear my I've got Boaz know you have the promise you have the promise we have Boaz by the of course by the the the whole spirit and we have that spiritually but but really Church we're still looking for him to come back you know we got all the spiritualizing going on that wants to take place some of the reality and they and they and the Corporal coming and the physical aspects of it there's more to it than just a pie in the sky or some imagination and where you just imagine that you are or revelation that my faith that you you're taking as well I've got a revelation well that's good but I want the substance I wanted to become material where's no more revelation it's reality Andrews was resting and that's what we have done we are here in the time arrests we have the first fruits of the spirit which is the Holy Ghost but we who have that we're still groaning a man I mean even Ruth sit him back there you know can he do it can he do it you don't rest my daughter rest all of the Old Testament says rest he'll come he came to us we waited for him for thousands years but he came to us this rest hold on to the promise don't give up though it Terri Hong don't give up stay right there amen don't go gleaning in another field don't go don't go and leave the message don't go running out for another word is somebody with me now stay right here and glean they man in this field but now here I'm gonna give you provisions I'll give you the downpayment that will sustain you until you're rewarded and so we still groan within ourselves we're still groaning we look at a precious brother like our brother like a brother they're laying in the hospital and here he's what a precious man laying there dying doctor says no hope he's groaning his body's groaning its travailing we travail Lord when will it be this is all over when will it be it's a difficult time that we're in it's a time when many Eagle eyes are getting filmed over and I said well was this the one or shall we look for another it's a time were men that with their unbelief has thrown every kind of microscope on the message to find every flaw they can shouted in your face to take away your hope to destroy your faith it's a time even though that even when there are those who are still trying to hold on I've become more and more faithless you know I just see in pictures of grandparents with their you know and and all of them all the things you know with putting their grandchildren on Santa's knees and I think what blasphemy you know how could we bless that how could we like that how could we think that's cute we received a message but people are losing their way yeah I you know I understand you know I understand that that you know in the way that brother Branham celebrated Christmas there would be many people that would judge him as pagan but he wasn't pagan he knew that there was a true story of Christmas that that was his he said a truth to Christmas there has to be a light shine but long-term do not become like the world don't you mix this with Santa Claus don't you mix this with some other pagan tree like this keep that holy hey man do you hear what I'm saying but you know again it's the delay is where people are losing faith is for people can hardly get a grasp for divine healing and unbelief is coming and the more the more we know about science and you know they they show us they show us all of the different things you know and and if that we're up against and and and you have to become as brother Greg priests like a little child a little child don't understand what the doctor says don't understand all the scientific stuff and it means nothing to them man and they with hope they believe in hope and they pray when the prayers seem like this useless you know it would take a listen it really really would take a childlike faith to stand before mighty mountain and say think that words can make it move but Jesus told us to do this is that right - forget your human thinking and become so simple that you can really believe can you stay with me a little while longer than this Lorna Amanda listen here how can we say redemption is over when we're in the very throes of Redemption the Bible said that we've grown within ourselves waiting for the option that is the what what redemption of that bodies while redemption is over well is your body changed did redemption ain't over as long as I'm here in this tabernacle of humanity redemption is not over as long as I'm still groaning Redemption is not over he's still my hero he's still my Savior he's still my kinsman he's still my bloody sacrifice he's still my atonement he is my mercy so how did we save redemption is over when our bodies are still not yet redeemed us so what my soul is redeemed we'll don't get ahead of yourself there's a redeemer for for the Gentiles there's an intercessor until we're changed that's all the way to the rapture then are you talking about a face of the rapture I'm talking about the fullest unrest so no notice God has not forgot God has not forgotten now what the enemy has done he'd not forgot what the enemy's done to you God's got a memory bigger than an elephant he don't ever forget unless he puts it in his bud then he forgets there's only one thing that can make him forget and that's what he atones for the rest of it he keeps an account hey man I mean even Cornelius do you know his is giving his giving and in the end giving up arms came up before God and God said I remember his arms therefore I'm sending him to you I'm sending Peter to you - to him now notice but notice now God doesn't forget like that but in Revelation 19 - he says for true and righteous I want you to see how righteousness goes with his kinsmen work and mat run from true and righteous are his judgments as he is judge the great which Kurt did corrupt the earth with her fornication and has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand so this is him he has evinced this is a tribulation he will avenge why out of righteousness now even look in the tribulation it's the blood of the Lamb that is saved a multitude without number I'm trying to show you something it's the lamb in the tribulation it is the lamb that will be seen with the multitude without number the church after the bride is gone it is the lamb that will be seen with the 144,000 so you see he doesn't cease to be lamb just because he breaks the revelation of the seals he's still doing the work of kinsman lamb so now notice here in revelation 7:9 you know sometimes we think well only the bride can be saved that's nonsense he's right now saving the souls of the church who are not the bride you think why he'd even among them oh yes he is I'll show you in the tribulation it's shown that he's with them and he didn't just show up because they actually wash their robes in his blood hey man he's been with him all the time Oh monsters he's not just there for the bride he's there for every name that's in the book of life he was there for the souls under the altar the Jews that was under killed in Eichmann and Hitler he was there oh do you know Joseph would say to the attention Benjamin and the whole group and then and he would say well you know he was done the same life but what they didn't realize it had been here oh the time it meant him giving him the provision give him their money back feeding them in the time of favor in a bit Joseph all this time and all the time the lamb has been watching over Israel he was there when I meant in them did that he was there with all them spirits come again he will avenge the devil won't get by with a thing all of his all of his adversary the Eichmann the whole bunch of will be in the lake of fire are you with me man they'll face the wrath of the Lamb and his judgment they will not get by with anything here's somebody out there denomination you hear them believe in God and getting healed and you say well how how in the world did they get healed the lamb didn't the devil don't heal the lamb did it hey man they believed on the Lord and her see forgiveness is him how did they do that the lamb didn't listen we want to get down here and say mercy is over Mercy's atonement atonement is not over atonement is atoning for the foolish virgin out here atoning for the wise virgins atoning for the 144,000 atoning for the father for the Jews we read it to you in the Bible this is this is him listen listen revelation 7:9 and I this I beheld and lo a great multitude which no man could number of all nations and Kindred's and people and tongues stood before the throne and before the lamb clothed with white robes and palms in their hands and what they stood before who the lamb so the lamb even comes and is among them those tribulation Saints he cares even about them look you're God's bigger what you think if he cares about the sparrow that falls well then why would he care about anybody they called on his name and just because they got deceived by false prophets doesn't mean that they're lost forever the gentleman said blood for that and they stood before the throne before the lamb clothed with white robes and palms in her head and they cried with a loud voice saying salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb verse 14 and I said to him cause a this multitude John didn't know him they wasn't his people who are they it was a bunch of Gentiles and guess what guess where they come out of now they were in the tribulation but they was raised from the dead they wasn't resurrected from the dead and they were in the tribulation that means they are alive now and how many a multitude that no man can number I'm innumerable number more than you can guess or as to me you say well only the bride's gonna make it yeah in the rapture but friends there's going to be many more saved and even out of the worst Dark Age that there ever was Laodicea where they got blinded by false prophets that just as the Jews were blinded for our sakes now Gentiles are being blinded for their sakes as the gospel swings back and turns back [Music] and God has a way of provision shall I say who does it the lamb did this so ain't no more lamb he is lamb lookie here the Bible said the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living fountains of water that's eternal life you see in God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes this is a great Redeemer this is a God who has more mercy than you can imagine this is a God who could say the cane cane but if you do right don't you know you'll be accepted yeah you didn't offer blood but if you come the way of Abel come on if you just come the way of Abel you know you're maybe you're always serpent seed that maybe you're always that but don't you know you'll be accepted this God that we paint as being the savior of only the exclusive view it's a God who has a bigger heart than what you could ever imagine that could even say to Cain Cain don't you know if you do right if you cut the way of the blood you'll be accepted even though you don't have a seed in you don't you know don't redemptions on you you don't have to murder your brother but if you don't sin lies at the door cops just overtake you you know what brother Tim that's extreme listen this God is doing some extreme things so we're in another dispensation that's right there's a bride and there's a church and the church is saved as well as the bride the bride just goes in the rapture and escapes emulation but they are saved before the tribulation ah look at all these sincere people out there and they're all lost don't you discount him god no dude without number and they cry with a loud voice got them even shouting salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne to the Lamb verse 14 he won't know who are these either I don't recognize him he said sir thou knowest and he said these are they which came out of Great Tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb brother Branham is clear about this because he said when the bride leaves there's not another Gentile saying the gospel turns to the Jews but as long listen as long as there's atonement for us for one member in the bride to be washed in the blood and to be recognized in the book there is a chance for the foolish virgin don't give up on your loved ones don't discount them all now I mean you know argue with the Prophet he said they are saved people he said who some way because of your fault or mine didn't hear the message or was in some way blinded by these false prophets and there's a binding going on and they would have perhaps believed but because of the blinding is going on has happened with Israel is horribly the Paul said if they would have known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory and if they would have known this was a message that would rapture them that they would get in the ark but they were blinded therefore there before the throne of God and serve Him day and night in his temple look here they're even allowed in the temple and him that sat on the throne said well among them and they shall hunger no more neither thirst neither South Sun light on them nor even any heat and the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them into fountains of living waters you see you already received the fountain of living waters that's why you're going in the rapture because he that truly believeth on me as the scripture has said through repentance baptism in the name of Jesus Christ receiving the Holy Ghost and ments hell out of your innermost being flow a river of living water but these don't have the Living Waters so after after they they come through the tribulation they are led into the Living Waters notice and God shall wipe away their tears now I want you to look at the adventure at work I may go a little long this morning you just have to bear with me it'll be nothing unusual so revelation 12 and 7 because here it is the overthrowing of Satan and remember this is a process it's not a moment twinkling I bent there's been a war that has been going on with Satan to overthrow him and Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels I love this and prevailed not he don't win neither was their place found any more in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world and he cast him out into their earth and his angels were cast out with him now so you can see here's a great battle between between the kinsmen as he throws Satan out of the heavenly places because he is making ready for the bride to ascend as is cast down because the place it is in as principal power the air which is which years of Adams position as he controlled the atmosphere of the earth but he is about to be cast down as a bride as sins to take that place once more are you with me now now in the fourth seal brother branham especially tells you what will happen he says and notice he shall be given a heart of the beast he's talking about the Antichrist the false prophet it would be would be given a heart of a beast at that time and Satan will incarnate himself now notice we've already had a man who the fullness of God dwelt in that was Jesus Christ but we're about we're about to give the world is about to give way to the coming of the Antichrist where Satan will take over a man in whom will be the very heart of a beast where Satan will incarnate himself in a false prophet and I which we believe to be the Pope amen because when the bride goes up notice when the bride goes up when she is she's raptured resurrection music brother Jim the bride's already grown up she's already sitting with him listen the bride isn't there yet she hasn't raised from the dead there's still a large portion of the bride the church that is still in the grave when the church goes up Satan is cast down or out see then it's done then all of his accusin is done a man he can no longer accuse us once we get our body chains but as long as we're in this rest Satan has a right to accuse us what's now the church goes up Satan is cast out notice is done all his accusing is done now it's long yes look as long as intercessors still on the throne Satan can stand there and accused so here it works the same way as long as Satan can accuse the intercessor still on the throne as long as intercessors on the throne Satan can stand there and accuse same way works the same way as long as Satan can stand there and accuse we need an intercessor on the throne he is upon it because he's the attorney on the other side he's the opponent of Christ in Christ he's standing there the opponent is standing there saying but wait Adam fell Adam done this I conquered him I got his wife to believe a lie and use said she would be damned bite I haven't but there here is the mediator standing there notice this is the fourth seal and here's a mediator standing there a man the kinsman redeemer and a man send there with that blood that can take the violence sinners heart and change it the mediator is on the throne see yes sir and Satan said but they're guilty and he said but they're not here's the battle Satan says you're you're guilty he says you're not he said you're justified you never did it in the first place but seasons still stand there and accuses and says but you're not and try to make you doubt what he did for you but he said but you're the pure sinless virgin bride of Jesus Christ you have never did it in the first place that Clorox was invented or manufactured to take stain take the color now to sink or any other stain they got it it'll break them too you'll never find it again it goes back to Casas goes all the way back to cosmic light past molecules and everything else till it turns back to the original where it come from it's a creation how the creation had to come from a creator but all the chemicals that was manufactured and put together they broke up there broke up and that's just all there is to it there's no more of it even the very the very water substant it is blends with the clocks which is Isis a man glory to God it's all clean that's what the blood of Jesus Christ does to the true child of God when he confesses that sin and stands there justified it is mercy goodness even it's so great till God said I can't even remember it anymore and he's absolutely my son hallelujah watch these next word very I say unto you if you say to this mountain be moved now we're not talking about humans now we're talking about redeem sons now we're not talking about being a little silly child and then trying to believe something that ain't can't happen we're talking about a redeemed son that knows it can happen are you with me I'll redeem son that knows his God and can do exploits hey man I'm trying to get somewhere now just a moment I just hang on him it takes me a little time is something like banging on the trail in adventure he's been on it a long time I'm on this trail this morning don't let me catch him now hey man we're gonna overtake him this morning a man who said to you you're a redeemed son he says hey man I know it's true do you know it's true hey man no but right now regardless of how much he says were justified and our sins are gone the accuser is still saying it's not true and he's trying to make you disbelieve what God did for you so I want to show you in the future home where brother Branham says that Satan is still the accuser he said Satan is still here what Satan is still here that's the reason all these things happen he's still here and all his evil forces are still here and now that's why the earth is so filthy that's why the scum and ridiculous things that goes on bloodshed war politics in adultery all kinds of built-in this goes on is because Satan is the ruler of this earth and this atmosphere you say the atmos yes sir both the heavens of the earth now it's contaminated with Devils that can accuse us before God Jesus is there to intercede for us hallelujah oh ma no Church the devil says you did it Jesus says you didn't that is covered with his blood come on that you never did it in the first place now it all depends on who you're gonna believe Satan knows is through what the blood did for you but you but do you know what the blood did for you [Music] do you know the power this but Jesus it is safe to intercede for us hey man I don't care what the scuppers say what the unbelievers want to say what all the theologian around the message say but this prophet said Jesus is there to intercede for us and Wow the accuser keeps pointing the finger they did this they did this they did this the blood still love us he came to redeem that elected that he foresaw and that's why it's so filthy today this is because Satan is still right now prints power the air atmosphere trying to keep your atmosphere under cloaked with unbelief the Jubilee trumpet is sounded and you're still there deciding one of the lay down your hoe or not am I really free but let me tell you the blood still covers did you hear what he said the blood still covers he came to redeem that elected he foresaw that's why it's so filthy today but the blood still covers oh my in the message absolute brother Brandon said you day people talk about Devils and don't even know what they're what they are sometimes that's right but you run headlong into them every day maybe but you will notice and after a while he was accusing me you see brother Branham would even be accused vine and said you have no power with God you're just a buff you have no power can you imagine if brother Branham with thousands upon thousands of miracles signs wonders discernment healings are you with me and man that Satan's come to say and tell him he had no power with God and that you're just a bluff you're a fake in other words what was the devil try to tell you what's the devil trying to tell this this movie oh you know you're just like em all you're just another denominational group here you're just another ISM us ISM your justice listen listen he has been accusing us and say we're just a bluff and we have no power of God and he said I said what do you say come on he's been talking to you this week now what do you say I said Satan you are an offense to me get out of my way in the name of Jesus Christ and he left he can't stay here this morning because there are people [Applause] how can I overcome brother brendensen overcome is to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks hey man look lots of people say there is no devil now you know they want to come well he's not more their toner sees no more the accuser listen they want to say that he's just a thought don't you believe that there is a real devil he's just as real as you are or anybody a real devil and you must recognize him as real you must know he's a devil then the same time that you recognize him and know he's a devil he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that God in you is greater and my here that he is that the one that's in you has already overcome him and by his grace that's favor you are more than a match for him that's real overcome and when you recognize no let's just look at this rapture how are we going to go in this right this is a rapture by blood it's not a rapture without blood look in Revelation 12:10 and I heard a loud voice members Satan's cast out when he's cast down the bride goes up brother branham teaches this in the seals he said when Satan is cast down bride goes he says now so so we can we can safely say that Satan is cast out in Revelation 12 the bride goes up in Revelation 12 it's a scene it's the scene that's a process of time it starts back right in Revelation 12 1 2 this woman were that he were the the red dragon stood before the woman that was going to give birth to the Christ child and he was raptured up into heaven and then then then there was a war in heaven and this war now has been going on for heavenly places then we finally come to the rapture time and when Satan now the picture brother branham tells us gives us a key to this when Satan is cast down the bride goes up so we seem cast down here in Revelation 12 and just read it now in verse 10 you're going to see where the bride is now in heaven because then I heard a loud voice saying where and heaven now I'm just going to go ahead and tell you these are the raptured Saints now and here's what they say now is come salvation remember this no we think salvation came 2000 years ago at Calvary no now comes total deliverance now here comes the fullness that was the initiation now here comes the whole product a man and what and strength and the Kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ here's where the full power is shown by rapture the church amen for here's the reason why is power shown the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night are you with me now and they overcame him is there are they here this moment and they overcame him Amen how by the blood of the Lamb so the labs bad raptures our church without the lambs blood you're not going in the church the labs back gives you the power to overcome hallelujah and they overcame him by the blood the lamb by the word of their testimony confessing that the word was true and they loved not their lives unto the death a man now all will be deceived except those whose are in the Lamb's Book of Life that's revelations 13 and 8 so all that dwell on the earth will be whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain so you've got to belong to the lamb amen now after the bride is raptured Christ is not yet king of the earth but he's still the lamb and redemption is still ongoing let me give guarantee he does not cease being a lamb when the ride is raptured he continues his Redemption work even in the tribulation so now we're going to see him here um when it before that he becomes king of the earth and he's still claiming his subjects that now he goes to claim all that are redeemed and there's a hundred and forty four thousand which is the remnant leftover of the Old Testament Saints and it can I say they are they they are Jews and is why I say that and the lamb stood on Mount Zion and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand so even in the Tribulation Period this is revelation 14:1 to have that alright good so the lamb stood on Mount Zion with him a hundred forty-four thousand having his father's name written in their foreheads and I heard Allah from heaven as the voice of many waters of voice of a great Thunder and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps and his sung as it were a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the and no man could learn that song but the hundred forty-four thousand and the which were redeemed what about Redemption was over these were redeemed from the earth by the lamb redemption was only over for the Gentiles he missed going in the rapture and then the remnant was towed into tribulation haven't had washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb and there's not another Gentile saved but he's still save it and he's still sealing and he's still given the Holy Ghost he's still Reed diamond after redemption is over for the Gentiles he's still the Lamb so they were redeemed from the earth all right these these are they which are not defiled by the women for they were virgins these are they which follow the lamb wherever he goeth these were redeemed what from among men being firstfruits unto God and to the lamb and in their mouth was fine no guile means they were not dishonest they were truthful my names were sincere believers somebody help me preach and I want you to get this next word right here because here's what I want to throw it you know just really throw some weight into it but and they are read it with me without fault before the throne of God look what just look what it did for them oh and it's even more for you you're his bride and if he didn't if the blood did this for them and redeemed them and their first fruits to God your first fruit unto God and whatever the lamb goes you go with it hallelujah and here though there's no guile in their mouth and they are without fault before the throne of God Oh hallelujah look what the blood has done if it's true of them is true the bride now let me give you a scripture for you let's go to Jude 1:24 now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you what faultless before the presence of his glory in that the throne with exceeding joy to the only wise God our Savior I'll am I Redeemer be glory and Majesty Dominion and power both now and ever how many can say Amen proceed you faultless Sabet the power this blood gives you victory over defeat the power this blood puts a man on speaking terms again the power of this blood gives weight to the voice of a man who can say to this mountain it's under the power this blood that Moses was able to create a man brother Branham tells us and God hiding himself in simplicity if the blood of bulls and goats could give power to Moses to go out there by the commission of God and stretch forth that rod what did it the the blood of bulls and goats could give our power to Moses now we have no blood we have no power hey man it was only under that blood that Moses had power brother Brandon would talk about it and he said he said God would put a word in Moses mind God thought it put in Moses mind he spoke it it become a word Moses turn around went back maybe not a fly in the country an hour from there there was one old green fly begin to buzz around half an hour is 10 pounds per square yard what was it it was a creative word god that was spoke by the lips of a mortal man notice what it was under the blood of bulls and goats Oh God uses men God could have used the Sun to preach the gospel God could have used the wind to preach the gospel but God chose men to preach the gospel now brother Branham poses a question what's the matter with the church today my opinion we're not coming to that sincerity to the right thing for that you've got to do that under the blood of bulls and goats that only covered sin and made a perpetuation for the center but sin was there only covered over what can he do to the blood of his son that omits in God is not manufactured but he created a blood that takes away all sin then he said in the fourth seal I believe that blood that sin will be broke up when is confessed of on the basis of the blood of Jesus Christ listen the whole seals brother Branham is talking about what the black has done for you where it is positioned you who you are in Christ hey man and he said that's where the blood of Christ does i'm started trying to get to time now the creative power of God is in him then at least when God can command it to be done it'll be done going on down you stand in the presence as a redeemed son he said I think to now that I see the church is far beyond his standard of living I think too many times we're probing instead of really coming out and facing the issue I wonder if this morning this group of people could face the issue a man of who what the blood is done for you of who you are in Christ amen that you spend thoughtless before the throne a man that you are not standing there is and as a weekend of vigil but as a son of God who know our people who knows their God who can't do exploits Oh brother branham said there's something wrong somewhere in the churches he comes down to the indictment he tells us the only place that God will meet man is under the shed blood and when you turned the blood down your meeting place with God it has been taken away and a man God made his first decision in the garden reading a man but only worship under the shed blood of the sacrifice that's the only place God met man then that's the only place God will meet man now hey man or ever dead I'm reading with man there again and that's the only place he meets this man today today is under the blood shed blood of the sacrifice hey man he'll not meet you he goes on saying he'll not meet you Sam any costal he won't meet you either say in your message believer he won't meet you say oh I got this mystery and I know this and we are to you today we don't need blood we got an atonement my faith he will not meet you he will meet you under one condition and that's under the shed blood when your sins have been confessed and expelled in his presence and then by the blood and that blood is always before him and therefore that he can only see you through that shed blood and you're white as snow see you've done confessor you've can when you confess your sins otherwise you're not there and you can't fellowship and that's the reason listen that's the reason you don't see things happen and in the churches they confess to believe the blood but they reject a very plan to get to the blood the word use there's only one way God will honor that word you'll never honor it that words come say I'm a Roman Catholic I might demand this to be done you can't do it Methodist Baptist Pentecostals you can't do it there only way you can do it is under the mercies of God through His grace is to come through the shed blood of Jesus Christ and say Lord I claim the promise and if you're really under that Blood God is obligated to that word but first you got to be under that blood you see it now no wonder they can't believe in miracles no wonder they can't believe in supernatural no wonder they can they condemn it that's the reason they condemn it and back there is the same reason they condemn it today and there is guilty as guilty of me because it's only this shed blood and those who would dare some little brother dares under humility to take God at His Word walk out there confess his sins forget these dogmas and things and stand there under the blood and believe it they want to call him a fanatic that want to call him there as I say it's not a good word to use it to pulpit so you'll understand he's an oddball you see but there's only one place that he's going to meet us and brother Brandon would say in that next quote he said and God will never meet it till it comes under the care of that blood now the power of this mud it brought squirrels into existence nothing not three squirrels but three times three and then the next one God spoken word is somebody with me how did that happen a simple man standing under the shed blood calling those things that I that are not as though they were and
