[Music] the [Music] and [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I [Music] they must have been the hand of the Lord amen only he can do what he's done hey man we'll let you be seated this morning it's good to be in the house the law a man just wanted to update you on a few things it's been going on as you know brother Tim's not here this morning and yeah went on a mission this weekend last weekend I was up and no Missouri ministering a little church there and brother Eric reeks and and hooves driving left is driving home on Monday morning and just came really strong on my heart to call my father and talk to him about things and about brother Ron in the situation that was taking place there and to tell him you know we just had made the decision not to go to Japan and to the Philippines that right now has been postponed actually it's not canceled but postponed till June so I'll just be praying about that the first of June we're looking to go there still and we're just believing brother Ron's gonna go with us amen that's the kind of god I serve a man and so but Monday morning really feeling the urge and the unction to tell him that I you know I really felt he needed to go be with brother on this weekend and and he would soon thereafter decide to go and to buy tickets to go and and they arrived there on Thursday morning they left out right after you know the Wednesday Thursday left out to go there it was to be a surprise for brother Ron nobody was I think the whole world seemed to know but he didn't know somehow but anyway was able to keep it that way and but he did wake up I think on Monday or Tuesday brother I think it was Tuesday brother Andrew texted me said this guy he said he'd come up this morning told me said I really feel like some of my friends are about to come see me and so he had he kind of had a little unction there himself but you know as they would they would come to the Airport to meet them that was just a very emotional moment as you can imagine he had been getting a lot of bad news in the last few weeks just every week and but they would they would go there to the to the airport and meet my father and sister Karen and they would have a quiet embrace and a moment there together as brother ron was just overwhelmed by what was taking place and he had actually got up that morning and and just as he would pray he would said lord I need a boost I need I need something today that just because he just kept getting bad news after bad news and and he said while what a boost he said when your buddy comes to see you like that and then they would they would get in the car and go home and go to brother Ron's and and the brother there one of the nephews of brother Ron I believe it is or actually sister Connie had opened the door and when they walked in he had let brother Donnie and sister Carol in there so they was in the house waiting on them and they begin to talk about the things of God and God came on the scene and just came into the place and they knelt down and prayed and cursed that devil and I believe the healing is taking place even now a man we got this from Billy Ron today he said this week the doctors have declared that mast mast melanoma cancer is in the lymph nodes in both lungs they're surgical biopsy two different procedures they have asked me to see the oncologist on Tuesday this week coming for treatments treatment recommendations but he said here's God's report on Thursday morning I got down on my knees and I asked God for a boost eight weeks of bad news each week worse and worse but God was already on the move brother Joe Greene was able to come to every surgery very thankful for that but Thursday afternoon I was surprised with two of God's angels by the Tim Pruitt and brother Donny Reagan and wives wow wow wow there's the evening we had a prayer meeting he came in the house he made a doctor's visit he brought us a touch that only he can bring only God can bring peace and calm troubled waters I ask you to continue to pray for us on this journey God is in control I cannot thank them enough for taking the time to share their strength in this battle but we shall see miracles this morning I reported to my wife and brother Tim I feel like a new man amen that's our God this morning amen hallelujah brother Tim which he spoke last night about Ron's church on whose report do you believe also begins to be again speaking tonight but here's a testimony from that service a sister had sent this in this is to me America Lee so amazing how you can't out there I don't have no high words to put this into my into into and the same but you can't out think or outguess God he's got a perfect plan but their sister sent this in she said doctor you is an international correspondent affairs professor and has several PhD titles he's originally from Tokyo Japan but has lived in the United States for 25 years he's an alumni of Penn State who taught three classes I had dear my graduate studies he's a philosopher and has always said you must have scientific evidence to prove anything but the dissertation for English literature had already been accepted I was very thankful and we had year-in-review on Monday and Tuesday and I shared with him that contrary to many opinions the supernatural occurred several times in history without sin scientific understanding I used several examples in the Bible know in the art regardless of scientific proof it rained 40 days and night God shut the door not knowing another example was Joshua and the son standing still and the question was asked how when scientific research says there had to be movement I stated I don't know how God did it I just know it happened he said but before leaving the campus I shared that I would be at J mu which is a college there near by brother on visiting special friends and church family in Elkton I shared the you tink youtube link and expressed you could check out online this out online and you will be blessed and encouraged but let so last night during the service my phone kept vibrating I knew it must be urgent as my family knew I was in church so I checked my phone it was dr. u he had decided to check out the youtube link and brother Pruitt's comments about Joshua and the son standing steel and he's shared that he was so overwhelmed by presents they came in his room that he fell on his knees and gave his heart to the Lord hallelujah he was thankful that the Lord understood him as he had never prayed he had never prayed he asked me what should I do next I replied be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he quickly said that he knew someone who could do that so thankfully so thanks I'm so thankful to share the good news with others we're looking for the last one I'm thankful that our paths crossed who knew I would complete my graduate studies and would encourage him to listen to the truth God knew and I'm so thankful brother Tim writes this this morning he said as you all know I was supposed to be leaving to minister in Japan but God had other plans and he sent me on a mission and a while here God has saved a Japanese professor this is an incredible miracle I just think it's so amazing I forfeited going to Japan to come here and God still saves a Japanese answering his question discerning his hearts and he's experienced salvation what a mighty God whose vision were walking in like Philip leaving a meeting to minister to one man the ministry continues so what shall we say we're writing another book of Acts hallelujah you know when you speak sometimes feeling the anointing of God the devil loves to come and whisper in your ear and just say well you just made all that up you just kind of got a little feeling got a little excited but when God comes behind it and backs it up with healing and salvation that'll shut the mouth of the enemy hallelujah we are writing another book of Acts hey man let's stand together this morning let's just go to him and prayer how many would have a need you don't want to just talk to the Lord for a moment they say God come by my way and speak to my heart let's just all pray together as we thank the Lord for this wonderful testimony of this healing and this salvation amen this is just the beginning God is doing something wonderful Lord Jesus we just come to you today Lord with our hearts open to you Lord just asking fathers there be anything that we've done that you'd forgive us washes cleanses by your blood Lord we're so thankful to hear father this healing that has taken place in our brother Ron no matter what science says what the doctor says but when dr. Jesus comes in the room Lord the angel of God to minister and and to bring met your ministering spirits Lord to raise us up in times of need in situations of our lives God which is so thankful Lord for this this report and we believe this report we're II believe we believe the report of God this morning they said by your stripes he's healing and Lord in the middle of it all the Lord you to bring salvation Lord to a heart and never prayed to you don't know nothing about you but God the presence of God to come into his room and convict him and even fall on his knees what a mighty God we serve Lord it ought to so stir us this morning to realize our God fights for us it may seem like everything's falling apart it may seem like the boats going down it may seem like waves are crashing on every side but God fights for us nor this morning we commit these hands that were raised in this building you know every heart you know ever need you know every situation we just ask that you would come and touch each one we pray move in a mighty way father we invite you to come we invite you to be the most welcome guests here today Lord Lord are not just a guest but Lord somebody that feels welcome Lord part of the family of God we love you and thank you for all those things in Jesus name Amen and amen let's turn to revelations 1 and verse 1 hey man I just like to continue on this thought of the Lord is a man of war the Lord is a man of war revelations 1 and verse 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ was God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John who bare record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth are you blessed this morning blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand and John said to John to the seven churches which are in Asia grace be unto you and peace from him which is which was and which is to come from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness oh my the faithful witness the first begotten of the Dead and the Prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and has made us kings and priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion for ever and ever amen behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all Kindred's of all the earth shall wail because of him even so a man I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending saith the LORD which is which was and which is to come the Almighty and I John who also am your brother and companion companion in tribulation and in kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ which was in the isle that is called Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and behind heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what they'll see us write in the book and send it into the seven churches which are in Asia to Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira unto Sardis unto Philadelphia and the Laodicea and I turned and see it and turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks was one like unto the Son of man clothed in a garment down to the foot and Girt around about the paps with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were like white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass as they were burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and his countless were as the sunshine lethen his strength and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death amen let me let you be seated today as we look at this picture of the Son of Man clothed with a garment down to his foot and Girt about the paps with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were like white wool signifying as a judge representing the judges white as snow and his eyes were as flames of fire and his feet were like unto fine brass in other words it was very heavy they were very big and bold they were they were feet that were ready he meant to stand upon anything that would rise up against it and as they an age they burned in the furnace and his feet and his voice as a sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword so as we will read later on and just full of the angel that stood there and we'd read it here in the last couple of services but the angel that stood there with a sword that was drawn he was showing or signifying that he had come down to be a men to place himself in the battle to place himself a man with you or with Joshua amen as we read here he may send a message to all seven Church ages so we believe that we are in the label to see in the last church age but he showed in this first this first chapter of Revelations showing very Amen significantly significantly and very openly that he was in every church age that it was not you trying to order those to the cert 7 church age he is trying to battle long or trying to war by themselves but he placed himself there with them and he placed himself amen in a in a posture of war in a posture Amen of supreme dominance and a posture of supreme authority amen his authority as a judge Authority as a warrior amen and but not only did he do that he also placed you as kings and priests he meant to have a dominion over something you know and you know and as he would say here I he said it through here many times I am Alpha and Omega I am the first and the last he was showing I'm the one who started the work is the one who's going to finish the work and nowhere in between will I not be present he meant so nowhere where you're at no matter what you're in your trouble your tribulation or your trial just as he showed that the the Israelites as they would come through the wilderness he says he said I'm taking you out and I'm taking you in I'm the first I'm the last I'm the Alpha I'm the Omega a man he was showing he was putting himself in every footstep along the journey he was putting himself in every situation and every day every moment every minute listen this God is not a god somewhere way off somewhere ain't meant so in the far distant land or some other galaxy but he's showing you he's ever-present help right now in the time of trouble and he's saying I am he that was the Fed is the first and the last I am he that liveth was dead but behold I'm alive forevermore all right what was he speaking of I am the resurrection and the life I am the resurrection of the life he come down to show he is a conquering man he's come down to show that he was not to be conquered but he was to conquer now in his life as he lives on here on earth when we would look at him as he would go and he would willingly give himself to Pilate he would willingly give himself to judgment he would willingly give himself to this stripes on his back and the thorns upon his head and the nails on his feet in his hand it looked like he was going down defeated it looked like Satan had cut I was going to take him down into death just like he took any my other man but God has a greater plan and as we've heard even this morning that even though times in our lives it looked like we're going to go down and destruction it looks like our boats about to go down it looks like sickness is about to overtake us God has a plan and God has you from your first breath to your last breath God has you from your first moments of time in life and things you go through and trials and tribulations at your face he has you from the first moment to your last moment hey man you know when he was on here on earth Adams race had many fears you know they had fears and things and they still have them today and brother Brown said they shouldn't have them because Christ won it all at Calvary he won the victory at Calvary you know when he was here on earth he walked up to a sick man and sickness had bound the human race and he said thou spirit about DevOps II come out of the man what was it he came to conquer every devil he came down not to be defeated he came down to be victorious he came down in human flesh to take on human battles to know what you're going through this morning to know the trials of your life to understand what it's like for you to go through what you go through he wanted to be a God of every day he wanted to be a God of every moment he wanted to be a God who can have compassion upon you and know what it's like to have a headache know what it's like for your blood pressure to be you know what it's like when your body's turning against you things are happening he wanted to know about it so he came down to conquer every disease and we see here when he was on earth he would speak not to her he wouldn't save you blood pressure or or use cancer or are you blindness or then he would say thou spirit without devil he meant what was it he was coming down to show us it's not a flesh and blood affair but we were fighting against principalities against powers up against all kind of darkness and high places amen but he came to show us amen that we can beat more than conquerors as he was he conquered a devil when he laid at the grave of a dead man he conquered death for the man or sickness amen are some kind of spirit that would overtake a maniac and just try to destroy him he came down to conquer him he conquered a death everywhere he met him he conquered the devil everywhere he met him and I want you to understand he still does that today he conquers the devil everywhere he meets him if he meets him in a church service or he meets him in the prayer line or it meets him in a living room and then cancer is trying to eat up a body that devil has to be conquered and put under our feet hallelujah he conquered the devil everywhere he met him and he not only conquered in himself but he left the Commission to you the church and said you shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover hallelujah how could he put that in the scripture without backing up what he said and I know they got scholars and social gospel preachers that want to say that that's not ain't been anointed anymore but it's amazing what God can do with a nun anointed Scripture any man if that's not an order that's amazing what God can do with a nun anointed Scripture but I'm here to tell you it is anointed it came from the very voice of Almighty God and even as he would speak out of a flesh by man named Jesus and he would say you shall lay hands I love how I said it he once again as he would use the word all he didn't put a bunch of clauses in there and say a preacher or a minister or an angel this for that or something you gotta have so many px there he said you how many use do we have in the building hallelujah Amen you shall lay hands ask anything in my name and I'll do it so see what he said what what needs to take place is you need to start fighting with what's in your hands do you realize when you have given your heart to God and you lay hands upon there there's actually Amen portions of the Holy Ghost anointing of God that floats from those and begins to move upon a sick person listen to those hands that's been filled with the Holy Ghost it's no different than the hands are stood on a brown the boat and said peace be still hallelujah it's the same power of God because this is word working in his people I know people got now so full of doubt they don't want to do they don't want to believe that all things are possible why because they doubting themselves but I'm here to tell you that it is everything is possible you know I got a call yes your other day from a young man and he called me and he just he just had to move Church because his pastors been began to move away from the message he said I just had to call you said because I I went to Walmart and I was that Walmart getting a few things and I met this lady that was from my former church and he said you know III begin to till we were getting to talk how you doing this setting the other and next thing you know it led one thing led to another and she said well we're just happy other Tim brothers easiest having to get away from preaching the message because you know it's not producing overcoming life and young people you know his brother said yeah I had to stop Reese and I'll pay your gas he said won't you drive to Louisiana they even the light Tabernacle he said I'll show you a church where a message is produced and overcoming life and young people he said if you don't want to go there you go to brother Ron Spencer's brother John spirits go wherever he said I'm telling you this message works hallelujah he said you know you said the reason why I had to leave the same place you're at he said because I thought I was weak side and then convinced myself I was back slid there was no hope for me it was nothing I can do about it he said but then I begin to realize I was hearing the wrong message he said today I can see I can be saved my family can be saved my daughters can be saved my son can be safe because there is a message that works hallelujah I know we're living in the day whether you brother any would call it a social gospel make anymore peace and make any more livable listen this word of God is only livable by the Holy Ghost you won't educate yourself into it you won't get enough degrees to make yourself believe it even you won't you know Matt enough message theology sooner or later somebody else smarter come along and talk to you out of it we're not interested in a social gospel I'm interested in the same gospel Jesus preached hallelujah amen he said what he said what happened he said churches are denying themselves making it a social religion he said it's a terrible day they're trying to take all the deity out of it all the glory away from Christ trying to make him just a prophet if Christ was just a prophet where I ever won lost Liz Lena's going on in message churches right now trying to make Jesus just another man a prophet somewhere listen if he was just a prophet we're all lost he died in vain come on now but he was more than a prophet a woman told him you know brother branham there's one thing that I do not like about your speaking and said what is that he said you try to magnify Christ too much you brag on him too much you try to make him more than what he is I said if I had 10,000 languages I could exhaust them and never explained what he really is he's worthy of every praise that I could ever give him and I want you to understand this message that we preach is not the message of William Branham it's the message of Jesus Christ hallelujah I don't know where people get the idea that we preaches something other than Jesus this message is Jesus he showed himself all the way down through every Church age showing himself that he's in our midst hallelujah she said well I heard you say the platform you know he said if you if you said she said if I explained to you improved you by the word he was just a man you try to make him dear to us that he was deity God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself if he is just a prophet we're all lost he said I prove to you we acceptance is sure with the Bible said it I accepted she said well when we went down to the grave of Lazarus the Bible says he wept if he'd have been deity he couldn't we so that made him nothing but just an ordinary good man I said sister your arguments no good at all I said you failed to see you solve a man but you fail to see the God in the man I said it's the truth when he went down the grave of Lazarus he wept like a man but when he pulled those little shoulders back and he pulled himself together and he looked at the face of a dead man and had been on a journey for four days and he said Lazarus come forward and a dead man stood to his feet again that was more than a man speaking that was the mighty Conqueror what happened God had come down to fight Lazarus battle the dead man stood to his feet that was God speaking through his son he was a man but when it came off the mountain that night hungry had nothing to he looked around with a fig tree to find something he was a man when he was a hungry but when he took five biscuits and two little fish and fed 5,000 that was more than a man that was God speaking hallelujah listen I've heard man speak but I've also heard God speak and God speaking said it's going to be this way and it happened it's still happening our generation in our church truly he was a man when he was on the back of that little boat Ten Thousand Devils the sea swore they'd drown him flopping around there like a little bottle on a mighty seeing the devil saying now we got him but when he woke mm he put his foot on the braille of that boat and looked up and said peace be still and the waves and the winds obeyed him he was more than a man he was a man when he called for mercy of the cross he died like a man but on Easter morning when the seals of the Roman government had tried to keep him in a tomb and he broke every seal and he rose again that he might have died like a man but he raised again like God he was more than a man he was God's mighty Conqueror he said all we should love him how he should praise him how we should love him as he loved us and gave himself for us that we might be made more than conquerors listen either one of just conquering one man he wanted to come conquering many men is here he was he never preached the funeral what a conquer i'm gonna conquer this microphone in just a minute he never preached the funeral death couldn't stay in his presence how could death and life dwell together they can't do it that's the reason today when the church listen this the church is born again of the Spirit of God death and life can't hold together no more something takes place Christ comes in and conquers our passion he conquers our desire he conquers all this ungodly his vitals because he lives we live also I'm the resurrection and the life because he lives we live also he conquers everything that's ungodly he already did it it's laying in our hand just to receive it we see him in his earthly ministry as a conqueror certainly do but let's watch him after he died he still went on conquering even in death he conquered it didn't it at the grave while he was in the grave he was still conquer Bible said his soul sinning in Hell and he preached the spirits that were in prison that represents that we've not Reaper did not repent in the long suffering days of Noah I can see him as heaven and earth turning black rocks belching out the whole heavens giving up and just crying out as he went down descending down to the lost souls and those people who laughed and made fun of Enoch who made fun of Noah I can hear him say I am the one that know Enoch said would come with ten thousand of it says why didn't you believe him why didn't you believe Noah he's gonna ask some people same questions in this day everything I know that had had to know that he conquered when he shut the door on them and the days of Mercy was over and on down the it's pits of hell he went he knocked on those doors of the devil's hell and the devil came to the door and he said well here you are after all sure thought I had you when I killed the prophets I'm sure I had you and John head was cut off but after all now you're here all glory to God the devil's an idiot because they didn't know he was in trouble at the moment he said I can hear himself he straightened himself up and he said Satan I'm the Virgin born son of the Living God my blood still wet on the cross I paid the price I've conquered it and I've come down to take over hallelujah I've come down to take over and to strip you of everything you claim that you had and it reached on his side and he grabbed the keys of death and the hell off of him and kicked him back in the Hillary and blow he conquered hell he conquered the grave and he rose again he said what are you scared about there what are you scared about this he conquered Satan he conquered sickness he conquered death he conquered hell he conquered cancer he conquered every kind of disease he conquered every spirit in hell the spirits that you've been dealing with are conquered spirits the sickness that you've been dealing with is a Concord sickness hollow the depression that times the hold you is a Concord depression come on now that fear that is trying to grab here day after day after day I want you to understand this morning it's a conquered fear it's a conquered anxiety it's a conquered pressure it's a conquered devil it's a conquered spirit the devil doesn't have no party money the devil doesn't have no power this morning he meant his power has been strapped it's a Concord spirit and that's the Concord microphone hey man that Devils to come in their house he wants to he wants to torment you night after night after night you need to realize that's a Concord spirit hollow that sphere will succumb at you day after day after day after day you need to remind them you're a Concord cause the resurrection and the life that's Concord you listen if the king of the king of Shaitan is Satan's Kingdom the king of that kingdom he conquered him Lucifer he conquered him he took him and he stripped him of every power that he had then if the king of that Kingdom is conquered everything under him was conquered your depression is conquered I can't get off of it your anxiety is conquer the spirits of torment are conquered blindness is conquered deafness is conquered sugar diabetes is conquered high blood pressures conquer every spirit in hell this morning is conquer [Applause] cancers caca you are dealing with a defeated enemy you are defeated because I wasn't with a defeated enemy because the Word of God has spoken [Applause] how do you know his Concord because he went from there to paradise and Ezekiel said there yes that's the same one that familiar Daniel said there is that's the same one that coming that lines did I was telling you about Avraham said yep that's him he's the same one that met me under a tree he's the same one that met me after a battle going back to getting Lawton his wife that is the same one Joshua said yep that's the same warning and he's the same one in the building in this morning so what is the church scared about it he conquered Satan he conquered sickness he conquered death he conquered hail he's on his road out remember there's some more faithful ones he went to and we went through him just now real quickly job come to the door said there's my redeemer I saw him back there when the light was flashing and I screamed now I know my redeemer lives and in the last days I will see him there he is oh my the mighty Conqueror as we hear them sick as we hear him said come on children you were faithful over a few things come on we're going out this morning he said may we also hear the same thing come on children we're going out this morning you've been in there long enough some of you been bound in fear long enough some of you been bound and anxiety long enough some of you been bound by sicknesses or depression or spirits whatever it it a man you've been bound long enough you've been faithful now we're coming out Oh God let that be the desire of the church let's go higher this morning Joshua 5 and verse 13 and said it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him and his sword drawn in his hand and Joshua went unto him and said o thou for us or for our adversaries and he said now why wouldn't water Northern Dancer name but as the captain of a host of the Lord am I now come and Joshua Felony's face the earth and did worship him now no he worshiped him just as Moses fell at the burning bush and worshiped him so it wasn't just an angel Amen even they recognized that to be more than just an angel a man I was an angel of the Lord a man you know in the case of the Capitol the Lord host said unto Joshua loose thy shoe what was it he was showing my swords drawn in my hand it's not covered up it's revealed this is the time of Revelation this is a time of revealing and the sword that was representing the Word of God for their moment and that sword was speaking not of their destruction but of Jericho's destruction he was speaking that they were gonna walk out victorious he was saying that a menace he would come down and declare I'm not on your side but you're on my side and I have that'll bring the destruction of Jericho now Jericho is a perfect type of the seals it's typed out in the Bible the seven seals were typed out all through the Bible Jericho was a stronghold it was the key to the rest of the promised land and without him coming hoping the rest of the land wouldn't be open and no doubt others had probed at it they tried to conquer Jericho they tried to have come against it trying to tear the walls down but it was sealed but one day a sword came down transferred from the angel of the Lord to the hand of Joshua hey man a battle plan to bring the walls down why was so God so concerned Warner would open up the promised land another he was concerned about those walls because there was a seat of God on the inside and he'll do whatever it takes to get to that seat he'll cancel trips he'll do whatever it takes he'll take a man tray translate him all the way over to somewhere else to minister to one person my goodness if we're not living in another book of Acts I don't know what's happening a sword came down now we know a sword came down in our generation brother Brandon would speak about he said I was standing in prayer this isn't the first time I mentioned the breach between the seven church ages and seven seals mentions a couple of times afterwards so standing in prayer something happened something fell into my hand he said if you don't understand spiritual things as may seem very strange but something struck my hand and when I looked it was a sword and the handle was made of pearl the prettiest pearl ever seen the guard was gold the sabres blade wasn't too long but it was just razor sharp just right for cutting Devils heads off just right for going in there and cutting darkness off of people's hearts this sword was so sharp in Joshua's day that it would knock the walls of Jericho down beset one house the word is the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart you think the word didn't know where she was at come on now the word knew exactly where she was at knew exactly what house she was in what a dresser was where she was what she was doing and told her you get in that house and you stay in that house because these walls are going to fit God is going to bring us in here and if you ain't in that house with that scarlet cloak cord down Amen you're gonna die but if you do is we have commanded you you live that sword was so sharp he would go in between the brick and the mortar and cut it apart amen to leave one outstanding he's still a discern of the hearts he still knows how to go into where you're at you remember when that sword come here to where you was that and begin to cut off the chains of darkness and the spirits around you and the things that said you would never be anything and you would never make it and it was impossible just quit trying but a sword came in and it beginning to cut it all off Amen what was that it was a sword of God that's been delivered in this hour it was a sword that would cut the seals off a book razor sharp glistening Silver's a prettiest thing ever seen and it fit my hand exactly and I was holding it and I said isn't that pretty but you know he said I was afraid of a sword and I was kind of I was real glad I didn't live in the days when they used them I'm same way and I thought what would I do with that and while I was holding it a voice spoke and said this is the King's sword and then he left me and I wonder what it meant that is the Kings sword and I thought if it was a taking sword it might have been that I would understood it but it said the Kings sword and I thought the only one there's only one the king and that's God and his sword is this sharper than a two-edged sword his word as we read revelations 160 he said in his right hand seven stars and I was mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as a sunshine Athena's in his strength amen in Hebrews 4:12 said the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword and I want you to understand this morning we don't have just a sword we have the Kings sword we don't have just a king sword I was over there in France I saw their swords and the things you were so proud of held by kings of their day and people that held dominion and reign for just a moment but we have not been given a sword of some King gone dead long ago of some perversion of some perverted Kingdom we have been given a sword in this day it is a sword of Almighty God it is a sword of the king and that sword has been brought down not for our destruction but that the walls that had bound you and the walls of things that hold you might crumble around you hallelujah he said as a sharp two-edged sword piercing even dividing asunder the soul and spirit of the joints in marble you know what it feels like for that sword to come on you reach right in there and discern your heart oh I know out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged so now Jay and Joshua was they they was fighting a physical enemy so he'd come down in the hand of a man but now he's saying it's in his mouth because we don't fight a physical winner it'd be really easy sometimes if you could see a devil and grab a sword and go cut his head off go fight but with us sometimes it just sees eeky eeky those things that comes around and thoughts become to come to our mind fear begins to take over us and we begin to wilt and we don't even recognize before too long it's a devil it's a spirit that's attacking you you've been under attack you've been going through things night after night after night spirits haunting here but there's a sordid and it's not just a sword it's the king sword we're not talking about just any man's word we're not preaching any man's word this was this was signifying a word that was coming down to open up the seals to open up the book so we can understand what God was doing through seven Church ages we can understand his love and mercy his grace how he was orchestrating how he's going to be how and brother Brendan sent when those things open to him he said the Bible became a new book it opened the rest of the promised land hallelujah and this is what he's saying here and but in Revelations nineteen eleven and said I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he doth judge and make war oh yeah here you go again he is a lord a man of war and his eyes were flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the Word of God and the armies which are in heaven followed him upon a white horse clothes and fine linen white and clean and out of his mouth goes a sharp sword that with it he would smite the nation's he would rule them with a rod of hide he would tread upon the winepress of the fierceness and the wrath of Almighty God and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written king of kings and Lord of lords and he still King of Kings he's still Lord of lords we met what you need to do is look at when you see your problem before you say he's still King he's still Lord you're still conquered devil you're still conquered it ain't changed this because he's not here as far as visibly and sometimes we can't see him sometimes we can't see it that'll mean he ain't working that'll mean he ain't moving that ain't immediately orchestrating things on your behalf and behind the scene pushing buttons pulling cords doing whatever he's got to do to make sure you make it [Applause] mercy when it comes that word will come against all nations all men and none will be able to stand against it they may make God these social gospel lights and Goliath intellectual Giants might be making a bunch of noise and raising their voices and screaming that ain't so god don't do do anything like that anymore you know and there's no more prayer lines there's no more altar calls there's no more this this is where things are trying to go but this is where he's at he said it will reveal what was in every heart as he did Nathanael the Word of God will show who did the will of God and who didn't it'll make known the secret works of every man and why he did them it would divide asunder that's why it says in Romans 2 3 Oh think it's now this old man that judges them which does such thing and does not the same that thou shalt escape the judgment of God then it goes on to say how God is going to judge men it's hard infinite heart will be judged the works will be judged the motives of Judge there won't be any respect before God but all will be judged by the word no one is keeping it those who heard and what listen will be judged by what they heard those who rested in saying they believed it but didn't live it will be judged every secret will come out and they're hoping to be shout it from the housetops oh we really will we will really understand history then there won't be a mystery left from all the ages he said but how you know how do you know he's revealing the hearts secrets of men and women in the age in which were living who else could reveal the secrets of the heart but the word himself this is what blows my mind wouldn't you Pierre you hear the things that went on in our generation and people don't know who that was it was God speaking through a man only God can know your address no exactly the day you moved know exactly what's going on you can read it time after time never miss why the Word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than two it is so what it is the word it was performing it was performing where unto it was sent for the word for it the word is full of power full of power it's the same spirit that was in Jesus that's present again in the church in this last days as the last sign trying to head the people off from judgment for they that rebec reject him the word are now ready to come into judgment crucifying himself a fretful crucify him fresh again he said but now Paul said that the word came in power as well as voice the word priests actually demonstrates itself how many as witness that the word preached demonstrates herself demonstrations healing salvation cutting us loose from complexes spirits of torment what is it the word going forth demonstrating like a flaming cutting sword it goes to the conscious of meaning like a surgeon's knife to cut out diseases and set captives free everywhere those early believers when they went preaching the gospel God confirming the word with signs following it the sick were healed the devils were cast out they spoke in new tongues that was the word in and if you have any other gospel you don't have the word in action the word listen this the word has never failed in the mouth of believing Christians and in this last age it's here stronger and greater than ever I don't a pump some courage in our hearts this man to face our adversaries this word is greater than stronger and ever in the true word Bride so what does happen this word has been transferred from an angel to a prophet to a people hey man in Joshua it was transferred to Joshua but at some point it was to be transferred to the people we can read about in Joshua 6 and verse 1 he says now Jericho was straightly shut up because the children of Israel none went out and none come in and the Lord said unto John you reckon you reckon Satan was scared oh yeah and the Lord said unto Joshua see I have given unto thee not unto thine hand Jericho and the king thereof and the mighty men of valor so I've given you everything no matter where your feet trod that's your possession I have given you everything this is a promise that came from Abraham down through Israel to George Jacob Israel all the way down to Moses and then to Joshua as I was with Moses so shall be with you and he's telling him I'm gonna give you this land I'm gonna give it to you I'm gonna give you what's in it to give you all of it and ye shall compassed the city all you men of war and go about the city once the south I'll do six days and seven priests shall bear before their heart now notice seven trumpets of rams horn now notice how quick closely these things are tied together and seventh day you shall come pass the city seven times and the priests shall blow with the trumpets and it shall come to pass and when they make a long blast from the ram's horns this is the word this is a sword that's being transferred to Joshua a man and what you follow and when they made a long blast with the ram's horn when they hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall shout with a great shout so sooner or later it's going to go from the angel to Joshua to the people amen and the wall of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall sing upon every man straight before him and Joshua the son of nun called the priest and said take up the Ark of the Covenant let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams horns before the Ark of the Lord and he said unto the people pass on and compassed the city and let him that his arm pass before the Ark of the Lord and it came to pass that Joshua had spoken unto the people that the seven priests band the seven trumpets of rams horn passed before the Lord and blew the trumpets in the Ark of the Lord Oh coming to the Lord followed them and the armed men with and all the ones rearward from the art the priests going don't blow it with trumpets and Joshua had commanded the people saying ye shall not shout nor make any noise why your voice neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I bid you shout then ye shout shout Oh hallelujah on that day you will speak to your mountain and your mountain will obey your voice Oh hallelujah amen what was the seven times around and on the seventh day seven times around and at that last moment shout in that seventh age or that seventh time there was a transfer that took place from a prophet to a people that we have a voice and it's not our voice but it's the voice of the resurrection speaking inside of us we have a force and I call them from the grave we have a voice and I call our children back we have a voice and I speak and the bear give life we have a voice that'll speak to cancer and it'll have to COO we have a voice and I don't say there'd be so much money and it was we have a voice that says build a church and we did and let me tell you he's still the god of miracles he's been through us with us through every step of the journey look around he's been with us and even this week were meeting with a group that's taken over the over the graveyard and they're buying our old church since buildings from us giving us money enough that we'll better finish that building over there dead free [Applause] do we have a voice in her in her church ain't the voice of man is the voice of Resurrection hallelujah in Joshua on the seventh day Joshua rose early in the morning the priest took her put the Ark of the Lord and seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams horns or the Ark of the Lord went on continued and blew the trumpet the armed men went before them but rearward came the Ark of the Lord and priests going on blowing the ark second day all the way down seventh day they rose early the dawning of the day it is the rising of the Sun the dawning of the day and compassed the City after the same manner seven times and on that day that can pass the city seven times and it came to pass at the seventh time when the priests blew the trumpet Joshua said unto the people shout shout for the Lord hath given you the city last winds that we heard he was defending the city but the Nathan de wereld he's giving you the city he's giving you in your inheritance he giving you your Selah he's given you your delivers he's giving you your promise he's giving you your children he's giving you all the things that you have desired and so much more even so great that he doesn't beyond what we could ever imagine or think more abundantly beyond our home in the comprehension he's giving it to you he's later there before you and he saying speak speak the Word of God and see if I don't back it up Oh glory to God it came so strong to me this week that we have to be a people that's real willing to speak quit cowering down quit saying well I just live with it another day quit saying is just going to be another night another night with a frog wing payroll hello and we ain't no descendent of Pharaoh we are descended of Abraham and the God who gave them the city is going to give you the city he's going to give you joy he's gonna give your happiness he's gonna give your peace he's gonna give you your healing he said I'm gonna make you the head not the tail I'm gonna make you from above and not from belief that is his promise that is his work now you have to speak you have to open your voice and speak and let God back it up God will perform what he said he would do this city shall be a cursed but only Rahab the harlot shall live and he goes on he gives them the rest of the command verse 20 so the people shouted when the priests blew the trumpets and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet the people shouted with a great shout and the walls fell flat so that the people went into the city every man straight before him and they took the city and they utterly destroyed it hey man now let's look at the type let's look at nothing but now to our place revelations 5:1 and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written and on the backside sealed with seven seals and I saw a strong angel oh yes a mighty angel warned ready for battle proclaiming with a loud voice who is why they'd hope in the book and the loose the seals thereof no man in heaven nor in earth neither on the earth was able to open the book neither lift their own and I won't much because no man was found worthy to open to read the book neither to look thereon but one of the elders said unto me we've not the time for weeping is over because the line of Judah the root of David hath prevail'd this prevailed it means he has conquered he's carried it off to victory he is victorious Oh hallelujah amen it's any sense of getting in verse six and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and for peace in the midst of the elders stood a lamb that had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which were the seven spirits of God so here it is against seven horns ram's horns the same seven horns as it were and there it went around Jericho it's once again around this word of God seven horse this horn is as as a protrusion amen it's a symbol of strength it's a symbol of courage it's a symbol of a mighty and violent helper is on your side hallelujah and he is the author of deliverance amen you might have met the officer of defeat and the author of failure and the author of sickness and the author of trouble but in the building this morning is the author of delivery he's got a ram's horn and that horn is beating against your enemy back home from God's property take your hands off of God's property it is a protrusion it is a lord he's a man of war and he's fighting your battles he's fighting your hot blood pressure he's fighting your sugar diabetes you asked why I keep mentioning that because sugar does our high blood pressures in my house and I'm sick and tired of him but there's a ram's horn in the building this morning that'll stand between you and your enemy it's a battering ram and it's hitting against the gates of hell give plagues in the name of Jesus give way to the name of Jesus give way there might be walls around your children but there's a ram's horn can't give way to the name of Jesus give way to the name of Jesus there might be a wall around your depression but there's a ram's horn can't give way give way give way to the name of chief and I heard a shout in the halls of Hell begin to pop and plaster begin to come on bars begin to fly why because there's a word that's been transferred from an angel to a people hallelujah are you uh people that's heard the wonderful if I was you this morning I will take a few moments and speak to your wall so wall you're coming down in the name of Jesus there's a laughs hold here for you he's pushing and it's pushing and he'll will give way to the name of Jesus tried it this morning there's nothing neither present no things that come that can stand before the people of God he's the author of deliverance hallelujah just lift her hands and praise it for a moment no weapon formed against you will prosper [Music] praise the mighty name of Jesus showing there was one for every age I'm for no knees against the force spirits of of hell that would torment time after time it was a ram's horn to batter who my goodness senator revelations 3 and verse 21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne that is the same word as prevailed it's the same word to be carried off in victory oh my god I think that went right over our heads there's a people in Laodicea that's going to be carried off in victory picked up by the seagull anointing the Spirit of God for this age to pick us up over the things that we can't handle over our down to the struggles and the spirits that have haunted us night after night after night I'm here against that devil not about just hitting the deck God of heaven he's against that damned there's somebody here

carried off in victory victorious over every foe [Applause] this is speaking of Christians that hold their faiths all the way down against the powers of their foes against temptations against persecutions to win the case whole holiday this is what he said to him that overcometh your case is one revelations 5:6 he said I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne was four beasts and the midst of the elders stood a lamb had him in slain having seven horns seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God is there enough for you and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him the set upon the throne and when he took the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of the saints and they sang a new song now I worthy to take the book hallelujah to open the seals thereof for the hour so when you see this lamb was slain for you you'll begin to sing a new song you may have
