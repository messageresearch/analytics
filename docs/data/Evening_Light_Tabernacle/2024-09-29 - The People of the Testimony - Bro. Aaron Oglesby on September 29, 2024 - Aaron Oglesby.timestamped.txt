[20:09] this morning
[20:11] and man I'm just love the opportunity to
[20:14] Worship the
[20:15] Lord had this scripture on my heart the
[20:19] last few days and David said oh that
[20:21] someone would bring me a
[20:23] drink I believe that what's that's what
[20:25] the Lord wants this morning from each
[20:26] one of us just to bring him a drink
[20:29] Amen to bring him the praise that he's
[20:31] worthy
[20:32] of amen amen we want to remember to pray
[20:36] for Sister Janice Adams this morning
[20:38] she's been in a lot of pain and had some
[20:41] nausea and asked that we'd remember her
[20:44] also we have a prayer request turned in
[20:46] from Sister Marie Middleton she said
[20:49] would the church please pray for a
[20:51] family at Mount Olive they were in a

[20:55] fifth grade daughter were both seriously

[21:00] paralyzed there was also a young son in

[21:12] touch of deliverance
[21:14] [Music]
[21:15] from the loss and the hurt that comes
[21:18] with

[21:22] that is mindful of each one if he's
[21:24] mindful of the sparrow that falls he's
[21:26] mindful of every need no matter how
[21:28] great or small if you have a need you

[55:03] amen we sure love him we love his people
[55:06] love his word amen just ask if you have
[55:09] your bibles if you'll turn with me to
[55:10] the Book of
[55:12] Revelation we're going to read from
[55:14] Revelation 10:7 and then also we're
[55:17] going to read from a place in Revelation
[55:22] 12 you know I was I was a little bit off
[55:24] with my slide work
[55:26] Wednesday night got a little confused
[55:28] and a couple times and I I have a
[55:32] niece Katie I when she runs the uh the
[55:36] words for the songs I like to pick on
[55:38] her afterwards even when she does a good
[55:40] job I'll be like you know if you're
[55:41] going to be that slow I might as well
[55:43] have a song book you
[55:44] know it's not true it's just how I so so
[55:47] she texted me Wednesday after service
[55:49] and said you know the slides were okay
[55:53] but if you're going to be that slow you
[55:54] know I'm might as well keep my Bible
[55:56] but she's picking on me a little bit I'm
[55:58] going to try to I'm going to try to not
[56:01] confuse y'all today with the slides so
[56:03] if you have your Bible let's read in
[56:05] Revelation 10:7 we're going to speak to
[56:07] you today on the people of the testimony
[56:10] the people of the
[56:12] testimony Revelation 10:7 says but in
[56:15] the days of the voice of the seventh
[56:16] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[56:19] mystery of God should be finished as he
[56:21] ha declared to his servants the prophets
[56:24] so however you read this no matter what
[56:26] language no matter what translation we
[56:28] know there has to be a seventh angel we
[56:30] know he's going to sound and we know
[56:31] it's going to fulfill the Mysteries it's
[56:33] going to finish it amen verse eight and
[56:36] the voice which I heard from Heaven
[56:37] spake unto me again and said go and take
[56:40] the little book which is open in the
[56:41] hand of the Angel which standeth upon
[56:44] the sea and upon the Earth and I went
[56:47] unto the angel and said unto him give me
[56:50] the little book and he said unto me take
[56:52] it and eat it up and it shall make thy
[56:55] belly bitter but it shall be in thy
[56:57] mouth sweet as honey and I took the
[57:01] little book out of the Angel's hand and
[57:03] ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet
[57:05] as honey and as soon as I had seen it my
[57:09] had eaten it my belly was bitter and he
[57:11] said unto me thou must prophesy again
[57:15] before many peoples and Nations and
[57:18] tongues and kings and if you'll look
[57:20] with me also in Revelation 12:7
[57:31] and it says here and there was war in
[57:34] heaven Michael and his angels fought
[57:36] against the dragon and the dragon fought
[57:38] in his angels and prevailed not neither
[57:42] was their place found anymore in heaven
[57:44] listen we could close our Bibles right
[57:46] now and be blessed knowing that the war
[57:48] he's fighting he's a loser yes Satan
[57:50] prevails not whether it's in your life
[57:53] whether it's in heaven whether it's here
[57:54] battling against the bride he prevails
[57:57] not amen verse 9
[58:01] says and the great J Dragon was cast out
[58:04] that old serpent called the devil and
[58:06] Satan which deceiveth the whole world he
[58:08] was cast out into the Earth and his
[58:10] angels were cast out with him and I
[58:13] heard a loud voice saying in heaven now
[58:15] has come salvation and strength and the
[58:18] kingdom of our God and the power of His
[58:20] Christ for the accuser of our Brethren
[58:23] is cast down which accused them before
[58:26] our God day and night and they overcame
[58:29] him by the blood of the lamb and by the
[58:32] word of their testimony and they love
[58:35] not their lives unto the death amen I
[58:38] pray that the Lord will add His
[58:40] blessings to the word as you take your
[58:41] seats this
[58:43] morning we're going to focus in a lot
[58:45] today on that last verse and they
[58:47] overcame him by the blood of the lamb
[58:50] and by the word of their testimony and
[58:52] they loved not their lives unto the
[58:55] death I know these are very familiar
[58:57] scriptures that we've read scriptures
[58:59] that we know are applicable to us in
[59:02] this day amen scriptures that have been
[59:04] fulfilled and scriptures that that are
[59:07] being currently fulfilled because we
[59:10] know that that we live in in in in the
[59:13] in the days of the seventh angel a time
[59:15] when the word has been restored to its
[59:17] fullness by the message of Malachi 4
[59:21] amen we believe that's been fulfilled in
[59:23] this day the the Mysteries have been
[59:25] finished
[59:26] and we believe by the word that there
[59:29] there's a people on Earth today that
[59:31] have been and are being prepared for the
[59:34] return of the Lord amen I believe that's
[59:36] what this is all about we're not just
[59:37] Gathering to hang out we're not just
[59:39] Gathering to hear good words sing good
[59:41] songs although we enjoy those things
[59:43] we're Gathering and we're listening and
[59:45] we're feeding on the word to be prepared
[59:47] for the coming of the Lord that's the
[59:50] whole point of everything that we do
[59:52] amen and we are to be a people that are
[59:54] sold out to the the word not to our own
[59:57] ideas we all have ideas you know
[59:59] sometimes I think it gets misconstrued
[1:00:01] and and we say things like well you know
[1:00:03] you're not supposed to have opinions
[1:00:05] right sure you're allowed to have
[1:00:06] opinions sure you're allowed to have
[1:00:08] ideas but if your opinions and your
[1:00:10] ideas don't line up to the word I I
[1:00:12] would say we need to change our opinions
[1:00:14] and we need to change our ideas amen
[1:00:16] this is the thinking man's filter so so
[1:00:19] it's not not not sold out to our own
[1:00:22] ideas and not to what the church says
[1:00:25] but there's a people on Earth today that
[1:00:27] seek to do only his will and what is his
[1:00:31] will his word is his will so there's a
[1:00:34] people on Earth looking to live by the
[1:00:37] word and fulfill the word and do all
[1:00:39] that the word declares of them amen and
[1:00:42] I believe that these people are the
[1:00:45] Overcomers of Revelation
[1:00:47] 3:21 it says to him that overcometh so
[1:00:51] this is right here at the end of the
[1:00:52] church ages when he says this so we know
[1:00:54] that somebody coming out of the leot
[1:00:56] toan age the last age the most wicked
[1:00:59] age somebody's going to overcome
[1:01:02] somebody's going to sit on the throne he
[1:01:03] says to him that I overcometh will I
[1:01:06] grant to sit with me in my throne even
[1:01:08] as I also overcame and am sat down in my
[1:01:11] father's Throne one thing I want us to
[1:01:13] cue in here in this moment is we're
[1:01:16] going to overcome even as he overcame
[1:01:20] not just the exact same result although
[1:01:22] that's what it's talking about but we're
[1:01:23] going to do it the way he did it it
[1:01:26] you're going to overcome even as I did
[1:01:29] you're going to do it the way that I did
[1:01:31] it amen so we're going to get into that
[1:01:33] as we go and I I believe this morning
[1:01:36] that I'm talking to a group of people
[1:01:39] who are a part of these Overcomers and
[1:01:41] we're not all of them there's Overcomers
[1:01:43] from all over the world you don't have
[1:01:45] to go to evening light Tabernacle to be
[1:01:47] an overcomer but you do have to be
[1:01:49] somebody that's sold out to the word of
[1:01:51] God and filled with the spirit they
[1:01:52] overcame him by the blood of the Lamb
[1:01:56] the word of their testimony if you fit
[1:01:58] in that category then you'll fit in this
[1:02:01] category right here as Overcomers of the
[1:02:03] age amen people sold out to the word
[1:02:07] that that that's what we are we're we're
[1:02:08] people who don't who don't give in to
[1:02:10] the pressures of the age people who
[1:02:13] aren't infected with the evil that
[1:02:15] permeates man's thinking today you say
[1:02:18] evil permeates man's thinking of course
[1:02:21] Evil's permeating man's thinking
[1:02:23] thinking that says men can be women and
[1:02:25] women can be
[1:02:26] amen we're not we're not going to be
[1:02:28] affected by that thinking that that
[1:02:30] Biblical teaching and biblical roles are
[1:02:33] bigotry in this day if you believe that
[1:02:36] then you're just you're a bigot thinking
[1:02:38] that the type of thinking that would
[1:02:39] call good evil and call evil good in
[1:02:43] this day there's a group of people who
[1:02:45] have sold out to the word and sold out
[1:02:47] to the Holy Ghost and because of that
[1:02:49] they've been sealed away from that kind
[1:02:51] of thinking that kind of thinking isn't
[1:02:53] dominating your life look want to tell
[1:02:56] you you're crazy and you're odd and
[1:02:58] you're different and I look around and I
[1:03:00] say if this is different and that's
[1:03:03] normal then give me different Call Me
[1:03:06] Odd call me different cuz I don't want
[1:03:08] to be normal if out there is what normal
[1:03:10] is amen I'm thankful that we've been
[1:03:13] sealed away from that kind of thinking
[1:03:16] we we've been vaccinated with a vaccine
[1:03:18] that actually works amen this is a
[1:03:21] vaccine you're going to want to take
[1:03:22] amen the blood of Jesus Christ the
[1:03:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost and I believe
[1:03:28] that that Anchor Holds us this morning
[1:03:31] amen it doesn't matter how much worse
[1:03:33] things get Church it don't matter how
[1:03:35] much crazier things get or how much
[1:03:37] crazy people get it can't get much worse
[1:03:40] but you know what we said that 10 years
[1:03:42] ago we said that 20 years ago so I don't
[1:03:44] know how bad it's going to get but what
[1:03:46] I know for sure is The Anchor Holds I
[1:03:49] know our faith is secure I know the word
[1:03:51] of the Lord never changes and that's
[1:03:53] where our focus is this morning
[1:03:56] amen amen we have a rock this morning
[1:03:59] aren't you thankful that you have a rock
[1:04:01] to Anchor to this morning see that's why
[1:04:03] the world's gone completely mad they got
[1:04:05] away from the
[1:04:06] rock they got away from the Rock and
[1:04:09] that rock was Christ that was the rock
[1:04:12] that held everything and now now
[1:04:14] everything in the whole world is just
[1:04:16] built on sinking sand and it's built on
[1:04:19] what feels good in the moment what makes
[1:04:21] you happy you hear it sometimes be be
[1:04:24] true to yourself
[1:04:27] don't do
[1:04:28] that don't do that well you you've got
[1:04:32] to be be live your
[1:04:34] truth no let's bring it back into
[1:04:36] reality this morning there is but one
[1:04:38] truth there is but one way there is but
[1:04:41] one life and that's Jesus Christ you can
[1:04:44] live your life all you want and be true
[1:04:46] to yourself and you're going to end up
[1:04:48] truly in hell but there is a Salvation
[1:04:50] tonight there is a way prepared there is
[1:04:53] a way provided he said this is the way
[1:04:56] this is the truth This Is The Life Today
[1:05:00] amen it's all built on what feels good
[1:05:02] in the moment I mean come on it doesn't
[1:05:05] matter if you go to this church or any
[1:05:07] other church around town or anywhere
[1:05:09] else in the state I think you'll be able
[1:05:11] to agree that the principles and morals
[1:05:13] of the current state of our world is not
[1:05:15] what it used to
[1:05:17] be it used to be that people had
[1:05:20] principles people had
[1:05:23] morals but over time what happened is is
[1:05:26] homes begin to drift away from
[1:05:29] Christ institutions of school government
[1:05:32] whatever you want to call institutions
[1:05:34] began to drift away from Christ we
[1:05:37] outlawed him in our
[1:05:39] schools we we banned him from the work
[1:05:41] places we ignored him in our homes and
[1:05:44] then you have an entire generation of
[1:05:46] people that that not only do they not
[1:05:48] know God there's always been people that
[1:05:50] didn't know God brother Joe but they
[1:05:52] lived in a world that was influenced by
[1:05:55] God
[1:05:56] that's right okay so now we have a
[1:05:58] generation of people that not only do
[1:06:00] they not know God but they don't even
[1:06:02] have any Godly influences in their life
[1:06:05] to bring some kind of a moral
[1:06:08] compass to bring some kind of balance to
[1:06:11] the evil that's trying to come in on
[1:06:12] every side and the world is operating
[1:06:15] with all Sals and no anchor just however
[1:06:19] the wind blows today however you feel
[1:06:21] about it today well today this is right
[1:06:23] and that's wrong and tomorrow it's vice
[1:06:25] versa and tomorrow you know what I think
[1:06:27] we'll add a new gender to it next thing
[1:06:30] you know you just might as well recite
[1:06:31] the
[1:06:33] alphabet because it's what feels good
[1:06:35] today it's the way the wind blew today
[1:06:36] it's what don't offend this person today
[1:06:39] but I'm thankful today that there is a
[1:06:42] rock that there is an anchor that'll
[1:06:44] hold you when the wind blows when the
[1:06:46] world's going crazy when the world's
[1:06:48] going to destruction we're standing firm
[1:06:50] on the rock of Jesus Christ today he's
[1:06:53] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:06:56] listen I'm thankful he don't change his
[1:06:58] mind I'm thankful that this law ain't
[1:07:00] this is okay and then tomorrow it'll get
[1:07:02] you killed no sir but if he didn't like
[1:07:04] it yesterday he don't like it today if
[1:07:06] it was the way of Salvation yesterday
[1:07:09] it's the way of Salvation today he says
[1:07:12] I am the Lord and I change
[1:07:15] not Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same
[1:07:20] yesterday today and
[1:07:22] forever if he says it that settles it
[1:07:26] there's no debate we're not debating you
[1:07:28] know we debate it down here but in
[1:07:31] heaven it's settled it's a settled issue
[1:07:34] they don't debate the word of God there
[1:07:37] but what I love so much about that is it
[1:07:39] means this also once he has a thought he
[1:07:43] can't change his
[1:07:45] thought because he doesn't have a better
[1:07:47] thought he's a perfect God the first
[1:07:50] thought he has is a perfect thought and
[1:07:53] he thought of you
[1:07:55] thought of you and he can't change his
[1:07:58] mind about you today the Devil comes and
[1:08:01] says but you did this and you did that
[1:08:03] and you failed here God ain't sitting
[1:08:04] there looking going up got him changing
[1:08:06] my mind Angels take his place away he's
[1:08:09] not coming no sir he thought of you
[1:08:11] before the foundation of the world that
[1:08:13] means you were in him before the
[1:08:15] foundation of the world that means you
[1:08:17] were a part of him before the foundation
[1:08:19] of the world that means you are an
[1:08:21] eternal being and no matter what Satan
[1:08:23] does to you here on Earth no matter what
[1:08:25] dirt he puts on you what sin he puts on
[1:08:27] you no matter how he has to break you
[1:08:29] apart you're going to make it you're
[1:08:31] going to be there you're an eternal
[1:08:33] being God's not going to lose one of
[1:08:37] his he can't change his mind about you
[1:08:40] this
[1:08:41] morning hallelujah hallelujah you was in
[1:08:44] the mind of God before the foundation of
[1:08:46] the world and therefore you was a part
[1:08:49] of him why we listening to the devil
[1:08:52] anyway we read there in chapter 12 of
[1:08:54] Revelation he's already been C pass out
[1:08:57] his testimony's already been found to be
[1:08:59] false god he said he was accusing you
[1:09:01] before the throne day and night accusing
[1:09:03] you and accusing you listen that's what
[1:09:05] he does that's his job well the devil
[1:09:08] said this and the devil said that and
[1:09:10] and you know what he was actually kind
[1:09:11] of right about this no no no no no no no
[1:09:14] he ain't right about none of it because
[1:09:15] he leaves out of the equation the blood
[1:09:17] of Jesus Christ that is Sanctified us
[1:09:19] that has given us his spirit that has
[1:09:21] forgiven us of all sins God looks at it
[1:09:24] and says what sin are you even talking
[1:09:26] about it's in the blood of Jesus this
[1:09:28] morning quit listening to the accuser
[1:09:31] he's been cast down it's time you take
[1:09:34] him and cast him down in your life this
[1:09:36] morning amen he hasn't changed his mind
[1:09:39] about you just because you had some
[1:09:42] failures as a matter of fact the great
[1:09:44] thing about Jesus is he's all knowing
[1:09:47] yes he knew you were going to fail he
[1:09:50] knew you were going to fall flat on your
[1:09:51] face he knew you couldn't do it and he
[1:09:54] said I'm coming to die for him he knew
[1:09:57] you were going to drift away he knew you
[1:09:59] were going to struggle he saw your ups
[1:10:01] and downs he said yep that's the one I
[1:10:03] love that's the one he saw you in drugs
[1:10:06] he saw you in pornography he saw you not
[1:10:08] caring about God in his word he said yep
[1:10:11] that's the one I love I'm coming to die
[1:10:13] for that one that's the one that needs
[1:10:16] me the most I'm going to shed my blood
[1:10:18] for him this
[1:10:20] morning
[1:10:22] Hallelujah brother Bram says now it's
[1:10:25] says that he had chosen Us in him before
[1:10:29] the foundation of the world before you
[1:10:31] ever sined one sin that's right before
[1:10:34] you ever told one lie before you ever
[1:10:37] smoked one cigarette or did anything
[1:10:38] that didn't please God it don't matter
[1:10:40] what you want to put
[1:10:41] there you were chosen before the
[1:10:44] foundation of the
[1:10:45] world that means that we were right
[1:10:48] there with him in the mind and thoughts
[1:10:50] of God before the foundation of the
[1:10:52] world that gives an eternal quality to
[1:10:55] the
[1:10:57] elect you can't get away from that I
[1:11:01] don't care how hard you try I don't care
[1:11:03] how hard the devil tries you can't get
[1:11:05] away from that what's the Bible say
[1:11:08] about our bodies from dust Thou Art and
[1:11:10] dust Thou Art will return same thing
[1:11:12] goes for my soul I was in heaven and in
[1:11:14] heaven I'm going to return I was in the
[1:11:16] mind of God I'm going back to God I came
[1:11:19] from God I'm going back to God I can't
[1:11:21] get away from it but I sin I lived a
[1:11:24] miserable life I was a failure get in
[1:11:27] line me too we all failed we were all
[1:11:29] miserable but he said you can't get away
[1:11:32] from it
[1:11:35] [Applause]
[1:11:37] Hallelujah I love that an eternal
[1:11:40] quality it's an eternal word and you can
[1:11:44] rest on that word this morning there's

[1:11:51] day we might as well be part of
[1:11:53] them you ain't going without me sign me
[1:11:57] up if there's going to be people that do
[1:11:59] it I say Lord I feel the pull I want to
[1:12:02] be part of that I want to do whatever it
[1:12:04] takes to be part of
[1:12:06] that in Revelation 10:8 I'm just going
[1:12:08] to go through this quickly we saw that
[1:12:11] there was a book open and we saw that
[1:12:13] there was a taking of the book he said
[1:12:15] take the little
[1:12:17] book it doesn't do any good for the book
[1:12:20] to be
[1:12:21] unsealed for the book to be open the
[1:12:23] mystery finished and we leave it the
[1:12:25] hand of the
[1:12:26] Angel it wasn't for the
[1:12:29] angel and I say this with all due
[1:12:31] respect Malachi 4 wasn't about the
[1:12:35] angel so many years so many people got
[1:12:37] hung up on that on on brother BR I thank
[1:12:40] God God sent a prophet but he said
[1:12:43] behold I send unto you a lot it's about
[1:12:48] you the purpose is you the heart purpose
[1:12:51] of God is you he sent a message for you
[1:12:54] doesn't do any good he knew the
[1:12:55] Mysteries doesn't do any good if your
[1:12:57] pastor knows the Mysteries doesn't know
[1:12:59] any good if he's delg in the depths and
[1:13:01] found out you know that he needs the
[1:13:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost I got to get
[1:13:05] the book I got to take the book out of
[1:13:08] the hand of the Angel it was for me
[1:13:12] today verse n there's a command to eat
[1:13:15] the book so it don't do you no good to
[1:13:17] take it if you're just like
[1:13:23] this we got a lot of people with a lot
[1:13:25] of books on a lot of bookshelves
[1:13:27] collecting
[1:13:29] dust eat the book don't just talk about
[1:13:33] it don't just say I believe it look I'm
[1:13:37] happy if you believe it I'm G to say
[1:13:38] this again that means you've reached the
[1:13:41] level of the
[1:13:42] devil
[1:13:45] congratulations because the Bible says
[1:13:46] he believes and
[1:13:48] trembles I don't want to stay on the
[1:13:50] level of the devil I'm a Believer so is
[1:13:53] he I know it's true so does
[1:13:56] he you got to go beyond just being a
[1:13:59] Believer he says this has to get down on
[1:14:02] the inside of you that's what eating it
[1:14:05] does it takes it and puts it on the
[1:14:08] inside it becomes a part of you and it
[1:14:11] says it's going to be bitter in your
[1:14:13] belly know we're just going to stir up
[1:14:15] some things it's going to change the way
[1:14:18] you think this might be painful you may
[1:14:19] not like this part but eat it anyway let
[1:14:22] it get in there and stir you up you know
[1:14:24] what this going to be a different ult
[1:14:25] choice but eat it anyway eat it all
[1:14:28] don't leave none of it put it on the
[1:14:30] inside of you you got to feed on it let
[1:14:33] it begin to work inside of you and then
[1:14:35] in verse 10 we see John here
[1:14:37] representing the bride he eats the
[1:14:41] book and then verse 11 it says Thou must
[1:14:43] prophesy again before many people
[1:14:46] Nations tongues and Kings so it shows a
[1:14:49] an a taking an eating and then a
[1:14:52] speaking there's a speaking part that
[1:14:55] comes with this no notice the speaking
[1:14:57] doesn't come until after the
[1:15:00] eating we got a whole lot of speaking
[1:15:04] and not enough
[1:15:05] eating a whole lot of people got a lot
[1:15:07] to say but they've never eaten the book
[1:15:10] we get things out of order he said eat
[1:15:12] the
[1:15:12] book then you can
[1:15:15] speak notice it don't come to after the
[1:15:17] eating it's the taking of the book and
[1:15:20] the eating of the book that actually
[1:15:21] gives you something to
[1:15:23] say okay that's what gives us words she
[1:15:25] isn't the bride here isn't speaking her
[1:15:27] own thoughts she she's speaking what was
[1:15:31] in the
[1:15:33] book that's why he says eat the book
[1:15:35] then speak you're actually saying what
[1:15:38] was in the book that's how we're the
[1:15:41] voice listen to brother Brown he says oh
[1:15:42] God oh God still has a voice for the
[1:15:45] people of the world even as he has given
[1:15:48] a voice to the bride the voice is in the
[1:15:53] bride listen there's plenty people in
[1:15:55] this world speaking what they
[1:15:57] think if you want to give up all hope
[1:15:59] for Humanity spend an hour reading
[1:16:02] social
[1:16:04] media it's man I just thought people
[1:16:07] were
[1:16:07] dumb it's revealed to me now that they
[1:16:10] are it's a
[1:16:12] revelation there's a lot of people with
[1:16:14] a lot of pin and speaking a lot of
[1:16:16] things all kind of nonsense all kind of
[1:16:19] propaganda out there speaking what they
[1:16:22] think there there's others claiming to
[1:16:23] be his church that disregard the book
[1:16:26] and speak from their Creeds speak from
[1:16:29] their dogmas but there's only one who
[1:16:32] has taken the book out of the hand of
[1:16:34] the Angel has fed on the contents of it
[1:16:37] and was commissioned or given Authority
[1:16:40] by God to speak what was in that
[1:16:43] book eat the book it's part of your
[1:16:47] commission take it out of the hand of of
[1:16:49] the Angel this morning and begin to
[1:16:51] ingest it and then allow it to begin to
[1:16:53] speak out of your life it's not even
[1:16:55] necessarily that you got to say words
[1:16:57] let it speak out of your
[1:16:59] life let your life be a testimony of the
[1:17:02] power of God let your life be a
[1:17:04] testimony of the grace of God let your
[1:17:06] life say what the word says
[1:17:09] amen we also read in Revelation 12 and
[1:17:12] 11 I'm going to read this again because
[1:17:14] we're going to go down into this it says
[1:17:16] and they overcame him by the blood of
[1:17:17] the lamb and by the word of their
[1:17:20] testimony and they love not their lives
[1:17:23] unto the death
[1:17:25] we see here plainly that there's two
[1:17:28] components that allow Overcomers to
[1:17:31] overcome the blood of the
[1:17:33] lamb and the word of their
[1:17:36] testimony so what I want to do is just
[1:17:38] for a second look here at this very
[1:17:40] first part this wasn't just any
[1:17:44] lamb because we know that millions of
[1:17:46] lambs had been sacrificed since that
[1:17:48] very first one there in the Garden of
[1:17:49] Eden Millions had had been put to death
[1:17:52] but the blood of bulls and goats could
[1:17:54] never pay the debt that we
[1:17:57] owed it could never pay the sin debt
[1:17:59] because the life of one human is more
[1:18:02] valuable than all the Bulls and all the
[1:18:04] goats therefore it's not equal in value
[1:18:08] to pay the
[1:18:09] debt how how many bulls would you have
[1:18:12] to sacrifice for the life of your
[1:18:15] child if I say all right look um you
[1:18:19] know is your child worth 10
[1:18:22] Bulls is your child worth 100 100 it's
[1:18:26] worth a th there hopefully there's no
[1:18:28] number that make you go yeah let's make
[1:18:29] that
[1:18:30] trade because they don't equal in value
[1:18:34] so it could never pay off the death debt
[1:18:36] even though it did take the sinner's
[1:18:38] place it was a temporary thing that the
[1:18:41] animal was a different species and it
[1:18:44] had a different nature I want you to
[1:18:46] think about that for me it's a totally
[1:18:47] different nature in that animal so the
[1:18:49] life of that lamb no matter how innocent
[1:18:51] it was no matter how pure it was it
[1:18:55] could never come back on the believer
[1:18:58] that was an animal life this was a human
[1:19:00] life so so so the center of the
[1:19:02] worshipper would would come in and and
[1:19:05] and sacrifice this animal and he would
[1:19:07] go out of the temple with the exact same
[1:19:10] sin nature that he came in with he came
[1:19:13] in maybe he had a lust problem brother
[1:19:15] Joe I don't know what it is what maybe
[1:19:17] he had a issue with greed maybe he had
[1:19:19] an issue with line whatever his
[1:19:21] issue and he would come in with that
[1:19:23] issue sacrifice a lamb to cover those
[1:19:26] sins and then go back out with the same
[1:19:29] issue
[1:19:30] unchanged same desire to sin still Bound
[1:19:34] By by sin nature nothing had changed on
[1:19:36] the inside of him sin nature was still
[1:19:39] the dominating force that ruled his life
[1:19:42] no matter how much he hated it there's a
[1:19:44] lot of people sitting in a lot of
[1:19:46] churches that hate the way they are with
[1:19:48] no power to change the way they
[1:19:52] are so it doesn't matter how much they
[1:19:55] hated it no matter how much he fought
[1:19:57] against it no matter how many lambs were
[1:20:00] sacrificed those Lambs could only cover
[1:20:03] it it could only cover that person's
[1:20:07] sin that's why it had to be a
[1:20:11] man that's why it was only symbolism or
[1:20:14] it was only a substitute pointing to the
[1:20:16] true Lamb of God because when the true
[1:20:19] Lamb of God came he said Behold the Lamb
[1:20:20] of God that comes to take away the sins
[1:20:24] of the world world that's listen we're
[1:20:26] not operating under the blood of bulls
[1:20:28] and goats that's why we don't sit here
[1:20:30] and say it's okay to sin a little bit
[1:20:32] we're not perfect just forgiven well
[1:20:34] that's the attitude of the Old Testament
[1:20:37] believer because they sin constantly but
[1:20:39] hey they were forgiven if that's the way
[1:20:42] we're going to live our life what good
[1:20:43] was Christ's
[1:20:45] death it was pointless it had to be
[1:20:48] something more and that's why it had to
[1:20:51] be a human life that's why it had to be
[1:20:53] a Kinsman it had to be somebody who was
[1:20:57] like us so that the life that left that
[1:21:00] blood cell when he died on Calvary the
[1:21:03] life of the blood could then come back
[1:21:06] upon the believer that's right it says
[1:21:08] he offered a sacrifice one sacrifice for
[1:21:12] sins
[1:21:14] forever why don't we have to sacrifice a
[1:21:17] lamb every year every year every year
[1:21:20] because the life of that blood has now
[1:21:23] come back on the believer and now I'm
[1:21:25] walking with the power of the life of
[1:21:28] that blood overcoming sin in my life
[1:21:33] amen yes he was God but thank God he was
[1:21:36] a
[1:21:37] man thank God he was one of us he was a
[1:21:39] Kinsman and his blood set us free
[1:21:42] forever now we don't have to come back
[1:21:45] year after year after year after year
[1:21:48] with the exact same sin burden in our
[1:21:50] life the same failures Bound by sin
[1:21:53] nature bound by the fall but I can bury
[1:21:56] that old man I can bury that old man I
[1:21:59] can bury I I can bury those old habits I
[1:22:02] can bury the one who couldn't overcome
[1:22:04] and I can be filled by the spirit of God
[1:22:06] I can be born again by the spirit that
[1:22:08] was released from the blood cell there
[1:22:11] on Calvary so when it says they overcome
[1:22:14] him by the blood of the Lamb brother Joe
[1:22:16] it's not talking about the literal
[1:22:18] chemistry of the
[1:22:21] blood listen we couldn't do it with
[1:22:24] without Calvary we never ever ever want
[1:22:28] to put Calvary in a lesser place or in
[1:22:30] an insignificant role you couldn't do it
[1:22:33] without
[1:22:34] Calvary but you also can't stop at
[1:22:38] Calvary you can't just stop at forgiven
[1:22:40] because the Old Testament saints were
[1:22:43] forgiven you can't stop right there
[1:22:45] because then you'll just go right back
[1:22:47] into the same cycle of sin if you stop
[1:22:50] at Calvary you you with just
[1:22:52] forgiveness then you hadn't you had
[1:22:54] recognize the point of all
[1:22:56] this we got to go on in our experience
[1:22:59] until we're endued with power from on
[1:23:03] high you got to press further in till
[1:23:06] you have power to overcome till you have
[1:23:08] power to cast down Satan you have power
[1:23:10] to live above sin what are you saying
[1:23:12] brother Haron you've got to be born
[1:23:15] again and the reason you can be born
[1:23:17] again is there was a nature that was
[1:23:19] broken from a blood cell that comes into
[1:23:22] your nature and your old nature does
[1:23:24] eyes and you're born again by the life
[1:23:26] of Jesus
[1:23:28] Christ that's what it's all
[1:23:31] about Pentecost was the plan all along
[1:23:33] brother Joe that's right Calvary was a
[1:23:37] preparation for Pentecost because you
[1:23:39] couldn't receive the life until you'd
[1:23:41] been truly forgiven you couldn't receive
[1:23:43] the life until you'd been Justified and
[1:23:46] so Calvary was a preparation because at
[1:23:49] Pentecost couldn't happen if that blood
[1:23:51] cell wasn't loosed there was no life to
[1:23:54] come back on you until he laid his life
[1:23:58] down so we overcome by the
[1:24:02] blood of the Lamb it's not the literal
[1:24:05] blood I don't have a vow of the blood of
[1:24:07] Jesus in my bag back in the
[1:24:10] office it's not the blood literally that
[1:24:13] we're Overcoming By today I don't have a
[1:24:15] secret stash of it
[1:24:17] guys but I do have a NeverEnding supply
[1:24:21] of the life of that blood it's the the

[1:27:34] cheer the life of this blood makes you
[1:27:37] an overcomer they overcame him by the
[1:27:41] life of the blood of the Lamb by the
[1:27:44] blood of the Lamb amen there was a
[1:27:48] second part to this by the blood of the
[1:27:50] lamb and by the word of their testimony
[1:27:53] amen
[1:27:55] I want to look at this next part by the
[1:27:58] word of their
[1:28:01] testimony now I don't want you to get
[1:28:04] confused in all this and think that I'm
[1:28:06] trying to change the definition of a
[1:28:09] testimony just follow me for a minute
[1:28:12] what is
[1:28:14] testimony testimony is to Bear
[1:28:18] witness so these people of Revelation 12
[1:28:21] gave a testimony that was true that they
[1:28:24] bore witness of Truth they bore witness
[1:28:27] of Jesus Christ because they were
[1:28:31] accepted their testimony couldn't be
[1:28:33] false their testimony could couldn't
[1:28:35] have an ounce of untruth in it it
[1:28:38] couldn't even be leaning one way too
[1:28:40] much or one way another their testimony
[1:28:43] was perfect matter of fact it's so
[1:28:45] perfect that it's used in the same
[1:28:47] sentence as the blood of the
[1:28:49] Lamb notice they're not used to
[1:28:51] contradict they're used as like the same
[1:28:53] thing
[1:28:54] the blood of the lamb and the word of
[1:28:56] their test he's putting the word of your
[1:28:58] testimony on equal footing with the
[1:29:01] blood of the Lamb which means your
[1:29:04] testimony is
[1:29:07] perfect your testimony has no flaw your
[1:29:12] testimony has been
[1:29:14] approved and
[1:29:16] accepted so so what's different about
[1:29:19] your testimony Our Testimony these
[1:29:22] people in chapter 12 Who We Are what's
[1:29:24] different about their testimony from
[1:29:26] others because there's plenty of of
[1:29:29] Christians who claim the blood of Jesus
[1:29:31] and have a testimony and testify of
[1:29:33] Jesus Christ so what's so special or so
[1:29:37] different about this trouth that makes
[1:29:38] them the Overcomers of the age While
[1:29:41] others go through the
[1:29:43] tribulation the key to all of it and and
[1:29:47] we're going to be on this for a while
[1:29:48] but the key to all of it and to all
[1:29:51] overcoming is that it's done by the word
[1:29:54] all overcoming is done by the word so
[1:29:57] it's going to be a group of people
[1:29:59] Revelation 12 is a group of people who
[1:30:01] have received the word amen the
[1:30:06] word is it is it that specific brother
[1:30:08] Aaron is is that singular yes I am the
[1:30:11] way I am the truth that means there is
[1:30:13] the word just like there is one Jesus
[1:30:17] although Paul talks about how they're
[1:30:19] you know they've created jesuses of
[1:30:20] their own making so people are out here
[1:30:23] claiming Christianity but living their
[1:30:26] truth there's but one truth and in order
[1:30:29] to be part of the group of Overcomers
[1:30:31] you have to have accepted the word it it
[1:30:33] it's so I want you to understand it's
[1:30:35] not me Overcoming By My Testimony you
[1:30:39] overcoming by your testimony and you
[1:30:41] Overcoming By yours it's speaking to the
[1:30:44] group here as
[1:30:46] singular they overcame him by the word
[1:30:52] of their testimony
[1:30:54] it's not that your testimony is going to
[1:30:55] be different from mine and mine now if
[1:30:57] we tell the story of our life sure I'm
[1:30:59] not talking about that I'm talking about
[1:31:01] how we got
[1:31:04] there he's talking to the group we all
[1:31:07] overcame by the same thing the word of
[1:31:12] their testimony so I want to go into a
[1:31:14] few places in scripture here to find out
[1:31:16] what the word of their testimony is what
[1:31:20] is the word of their testimony well it's
[1:31:23] because I'm I'm I'm testifying of about
[1:31:25] my life and how Jesus saved me that's
[1:31:27] good but that's not what we're talking
[1:31:30] about let's look here Exodus
[1:31:33] 25:21 and thou shalt Put The Mercy Seat
[1:31:36] above above upon the ark and in the ark
[1:31:38] Thou shalt put the
[1:31:41] testimony that I shall give thee
[1:31:44] yes Exodus
[1:31:47] 31:18 this is where he's coming down
[1:31:49] with the Ten Commandments notice what
[1:31:50] the testimony is and he gave unto Moses
[1:31:53] when he had made an end of communing
[1:31:55] with him upon Mount Si two
[1:31:57] tables of
[1:32:00] testimony tables of stone written with
[1:32:04] the Finger of
[1:32:06] God 32:15 and Moses turned and went down
[1:32:10] from the mount and the two tables of the
[1:32:12] testimony the
[1:32:15] testimony were in his hand the tables
[1:32:17] were written on both sides of their
[1:32:19] sides on one side and on the other they
[1:32:20] were written and the tables were the
[1:32:22] work of God and the writing was the
[1:32:25] writing of God Graven upon the
[1:32:28] tables obviously you know we're talking
[1:32:30] about the Ten Commandments here what is
[1:32:32] it it's God's law it was the word of the
[1:32:36] hour it couldn't at that time be written
[1:32:38] on the hearts of men and women so God
[1:32:40] wrote it on Stone The Ten Commandments
[1:32:43] were the current revelation of what he
[1:32:46] wanted it's what he liked what he didn't
[1:32:48] like it bore witness of him it was all
[1:32:51] that could be revealed at that time it
[1:32:53] placed bound boundaries upon their lives
[1:32:55] if you were an overcomer in that day
[1:32:57] it's because you kept the
[1:33:01] Commandments or you kept the
[1:33:05] testimony God Called It the
[1:33:08] testimony and at that time the ark was
[1:33:11] the place that they kept the word but
[1:33:13] that that that wasn't what God wanted
[1:33:15] brother Joe he he didn't want his word
[1:33:18] carved out in stone and and then put
[1:33:20] down in some decorated ornate box it was
[1:33:23] just portrayed PR something he didn't
[1:33:25] want the the the word to stay in an ark
[1:33:27] he he didn't want the word to stay on
[1:33:30] Stone he wanted the word to be put in
[1:33:32] you he wanted you to become that Ark he
[1:33:35] he wanted that word to live in you he
[1:33:37] didn't want tablets of stone he he he
[1:33:40] didn't want stones of testimony he
[1:33:42] wanted people of testimony he wanted
[1:33:45] people that the word was written in
[1:33:47] their lives and their lives is where the
[1:33:49] word was written this wasn't what he
[1:33:51] wanted at the time but it's all that he
[1:33:53] could do
[1:33:54] he couldn't write it in men's hearts at
[1:33:56] the
[1:33:57] time it was his testimony it was his
[1:34:00] will it was his word I'm going to go
[1:34:03] through some more scriptures that would
[1:34:05] show this Psalms 25:10 all the paths of
[1:34:08] the Lord are mercy and Truth unto such
[1:34:10] as keep his Covenant and his
[1:34:13] testimonies yet they tempted and
[1:34:15] provoked the most high God and kept not
[1:34:18] his
[1:34:20] testimonies thy testimonies are very
[1:34:22] sure holy Hess becometh thine house oh
[1:34:25] Lord
[1:34:29] forever blessed are they that keep his
[1:34:32] testimonies that seek him with the whole
[1:34:35] heart remove from me reproach and
[1:34:38] contempt for I have kept thy
[1:34:40] testimonies thy testimonies also are my
[1:34:43] delight in my
[1:34:44] counselors and he says concerning thy
[1:34:47] testimonies I have known of old that
[1:34:49] thou H has founded them
[1:34:52] forever why am I reading this why why am
[1:34:54] i showing you this because the word
[1:34:56] testimony is being used over and over to
[1:34:59] represent the word the Commandments the
[1:35:02] revelation of
[1:35:04] God it says that the idea of testimony
[1:35:08] is intrinsic to the idea of biblical
[1:35:11] Revelation that's right the content of
[1:35:14] biblical Revelation whether general or
[1:35:17] special stands as a testimony to The
[1:35:21] Giver so the Revelation you receive
[1:35:24] is a testimony of The
[1:35:27] Giver amen God's testimony is revelation
[1:35:31] of who he is it Bears witness of who he
[1:35:34] is and what we're talking about don't
[1:35:36] lose track of this we're talking about
[1:35:38] overcoming by the word of their
[1:35:40] testimony in the last days so just hold
[1:35:42] our thought how have Believers always
[1:35:46] overcome by the word Joshua and Caleb
[1:35:50] they were people of the testimony why
[1:35:52] were they people of the testim Tony when
[1:35:54] the other 10 weren't because what they
[1:35:56] said lined up with the
[1:35:59] word they overcame because they agreed
[1:36:01] with the word their testimony lined up
[1:36:04] with the word whereas the other 10 did
[1:36:06] not it didn't matter if if what the
[1:36:08] other 10 had some said had truth in
[1:36:11] it it didn't matter if what the other 10
[1:36:13] said made some sense it didn't matter it
[1:36:16] didn't match what the word said it
[1:36:19] wasn't aligned with the promises of the
[1:36:21] word and so therefore their testimony
[1:36:23] had had no
[1:36:24] credibility I want to look at that for a
[1:36:26] minute and just say this to you if
[1:36:28] somebody spewing ideas or doctrines or
[1:36:30] thoughts and it don't line up with the
[1:36:32] word their testimony has no
[1:36:35] credibility so when the Devil comes and
[1:36:38] says you're not going to make it he has
[1:36:39] no credibility the word says I'm going
[1:36:41] to make it when he says you're going to
[1:36:43] die of this sickness it has no
[1:36:45] credibility the word says by his stripes
[1:36:48] I am healed Satan's testimony has lost
[1:36:51] all credibility today
[1:36:54] he's been a proven liar from the
[1:36:56] beginning
[1:36:58] Hallelujah so Joshua and Caleb overcame
[1:37:01] because their testimony match that of
[1:37:03] the word
[1:37:05] right overcoming is done by the word and
[1:37:09] it has to be present
[1:37:14] truth it has to be present truth I want
[1:37:18] to make this clear so we all understand
[1:37:20] present truth is not new truth
[1:37:25] when we say the word of the hour we're
[1:37:26] not talking about new truth that's
[1:37:29] present truth is exactly what it is it's
[1:37:32] present
[1:37:32] tense it's for right now God's truth is
[1:37:37] eternal but there's a time of
[1:37:40] Revelation okay there's a time for more
[1:37:43] light to shine on the truth and
[1:37:44] therefore more truth can be seen it was
[1:37:47] always
[1:37:48] there it was always truth but now it can
[1:37:53] be sing that's why we call it the
[1:37:55] message of the hour it does not mean
[1:37:58] that we're only supposed to preach an
[1:38:05] hour I was in Louisville and one of the
[1:38:08] lovely stutsman Brothers let me know you
[1:38:10] know this is called the message of the
[1:38:12] hour don't you you know why don't you I
[1:38:15] got you I got
[1:38:18] you that's not what it
[1:38:20] means it means current truth yes it's
[1:38:24] what you need right now amen that's why
[1:38:27] it's the message of the hour what we
[1:38:29] believe is not the only message of the
[1:38:32] hour but it's the only message of this
[1:38:36] hour there's been lots of messages of
[1:38:38] the hour Rahab received the message of
[1:38:40] the hour that's how she was saved Noah
[1:38:43] received the message of the hour that's
[1:38:45] how he was saved right Moses had the
[1:38:48] message of the hour that's what brought
[1:38:50] the people out of Egypt there's been
[1:38:52] lots of messages of the hour for the
[1:38:54] moment but this is the message of this
[1:38:57] hour it's the message of right now it's
[1:39:01] what God reveals for that day to
[1:39:03] overcome in that
[1:39:06] day let me let me use a different
[1:39:08] terminology just to help some of us
[1:39:10] maybe grasp and understand exactly what
[1:39:12] we mean I know most of us do but God
[1:39:15] unfolds
[1:39:17] himself he's the god of an unfolding
[1:39:20] Revelation the the revelation of who God
[1:39:23] is is
[1:39:24] Progressive it moves on and on and
[1:39:28] on so in the Old Testament God unfolded
[1:39:31] himself throughout the Old Testament in
[1:39:34] Revelation to his people by what he was
[1:39:36] named and his name would give them a
[1:39:38] further revelation of his nature of his
[1:39:41] character of who he is of what he wants
[1:39:45] he was called
[1:39:46] Elohim and then in Genesis 17 he reveals
[1:39:49] himself to Abram as El
[1:39:51] Shi it wasn't a new go
[1:39:53] oh I've been serving
[1:39:55] Elohim but wait now there's El
[1:40:00] Shai now wait a minute now which one of
[1:40:03] y'all do I pray to Father Son and the
[1:40:05] Holy
[1:40:08] Ghost it's not three different gods it's
[1:40:10] three different offices of one
[1:40:13] God it's a revelation of who he
[1:40:16] is so then he's revealed as as elai it's
[1:40:20] an unfolding it's a greater
[1:40:22] understanding of the same person and
[1:40:25] each name has a meaning and represents
[1:40:27] his nature and his attributes then look
[1:40:29] Exodus 6:3 he says I appeared under
[1:40:32] Abraham under Isaac and under Jacob by
[1:40:34] the name of God Almighty but by my name
[1:40:37] Jehovah was I not known to
[1:40:40] them I didn't reveal that part of myself
[1:40:43] to them they never knew me in this
[1:40:46] way this is who I am in this
[1:40:49] hour I've always been this but this is
[1:40:51] what you need right now so that's how
[1:40:52] I'm going to reveal myself to you for
[1:40:55] this moment for this
[1:40:57] situation God's testimony to the people
[1:41:00] was his current Revelation to them his
[1:41:04] testimony is I am Jehovah and that was
[1:41:07] his current Revelation to the people I
[1:41:11] am Jehovah his Revelation his testimony
[1:41:15] so he had been known down through the
[1:41:16] Old Testament by names that indicated
[1:41:18] different parts of his nature different
[1:41:20] parts of who he was or how he moved or
[1:41:22] how he provided or how he healed he was
[1:41:24] El elai Elohim Jehovah Jehovah Gyra
[1:41:28] Jehovah
[1:41:29] Rafa all these things one God unfolding
[1:41:34] himself and how wonderful each one of
[1:41:36] these manifestations was each one of
[1:41:39] them was magnificent in and of
[1:41:41] themselves each one of them was amazing
[1:41:43] but they were just a little portion yes
[1:41:46] of who God was that's right it was just
[1:41:49] a part this is a part of me this is
[1:41:52] something that I do but then after that
[1:41:55] he comes in a
[1:41:57] body he comes manifested in a body as
[1:42:00] Jesus Christ and Jesus was all of those
[1:42:04] names all of those attributes all of
[1:42:07] those
[1:42:08] characteristics manifested in a
[1:42:11] body he was all he was elsh he was
[1:42:15] Elohim he was Jehovah he was the son of
[1:42:18] David he he was he was
[1:42:21] Jesus he was all of those things all the
[1:42:25] portions wrapped up into one he is our
[1:42:27] healer he is our Banner he is our
[1:42:30] provider he is our peace he is our
[1:42:32] Shepherd and it wasn't just those things
[1:42:34] in portion anymore but now they had
[1:42:38] received all that he was he was all of
[1:42:41] it he was the fullness of the word it's
[1:42:46] not that the other Revelations weren't
[1:42:47] truth brother Joe those were still truth
[1:42:51] but now you couldn't receive him as just
[1:42:53] one of those
[1:42:55] things Luther's message was
[1:43:00] truth don't ever get the idea that we
[1:43:02] don't agree with Luther's
[1:43:04] message is that now you can't stand with
[1:43:07] Luther's message
[1:43:09] alone that's we agree with Wesley's
[1:43:13] message but it don't stand alone that's
[1:43:16] right it all has been wrapped up in the
[1:43:20] fullness of the word amen amen so it's
[1:43:24] the exact same thing
[1:43:26] that I just want to re reemphasize this
[1:43:30] it's not that the other Revelations
[1:43:31] aren't truth it was still each of those
[1:43:34] things but now a body manifesting each
[1:43:36] of those things in one place and it
[1:43:38] happens again after Jesus goes off the
[1:43:40] scene because down through the church
[1:43:42] ages each age had a message and a
[1:43:45] messenger that revealed as much about
[1:43:48] God as could be revealed at that time
[1:43:52] it's the message of the hour Luther had
[1:43:56] light Wesley had light and it's how they
[1:43:59] overcame Luther's age overcame with
[1:44:02] Luther's
[1:44:03] message Wesley's age overcame they're
[1:44:06] going to be there they're your brothers
[1:44:09] and
[1:44:11] sisters but you can't overcome with
[1:44:14] Luther's message today amen just want to
[1:44:16] give you an example that would make more
[1:44:17] sense if you're processing that we can't
[1:44:19] overcome with Noah's message today we
[1:44:22] can build the biggest boat we want out
[1:44:24] here in this field and it ain't going to
[1:44:25] do nobody it ain't going to fit in the
[1:44:27] pond we ain't going nowhere we're not
[1:44:30] going in a Rapture we're not going to be
[1:44:31] said that was Noah's message though and
[1:44:33] it was truth and it was revealed but we
[1:44:35] can't overcome on Noah's
[1:44:37] message look at
[1:44:39] this Noah was Vindicated word for his
[1:44:42] day do you believe that well his message
[1:44:45] won't work today Moses was Vindicated
[1:44:47] word of his day do you believe that it
[1:44:49] won't work for now John was the
[1:44:52] Vindicated word you believe that it
[1:44:54] wouldn't work in the days of Jesus
[1:44:57] certainly not no sir law and prophets
[1:44:59] were until John since then the Kingdom
[1:45:02] of Heaven the apostles them who set
[1:45:04] forth the Bible here come Luther out in
[1:45:07] Reformation his words his church won't
[1:45:09] work today Wesley won't Pentecostal
[1:45:12] won't it worked for their
[1:45:17] day now God's promise to Noah won't work
[1:45:20] for us today God's promise to Moses we
[1:45:23] couldn't have moses' message Moses
[1:45:25] couldn't have Noah's message can you
[1:45:27] imagine Moses tell Us's build an ark and
[1:45:30] sell it down the now it ain't going to
[1:45:33] work we got the message of the hour he
[1:45:36] says we couldn't have had Luther's
[1:45:39] message we couldn't have had Wesley's
[1:45:40] message this is another time God
[1:45:43] allotted his word to each age so each
[1:45:48] age overcomes by the word for that age
[1:45:54] let's don't get it twisted and think
[1:45:56] well you know the word they had wasn't
[1:45:58] good it's what exactly what God wanted
[1:46:00] them to have so it was perfect it's what
[1:46:03] God wanted them to have for that age to
[1:46:05] me to meet the four horse riders that
[1:46:07] went out it was the anointings that was
[1:46:09] released in those ages but just like in
[1:46:12] the Old Testament how it was
[1:46:14] unfolded in different names until there
[1:46:16] he stood in a body of Flesh once again
[1:46:20] the revelation of the word has unfolded
[1:46:22] until once again here he stands yes in a
[1:46:27] body of
[1:46:31] Flesh me yes you and me and all of us
[1:46:37] with our little portion around the world
[1:46:40] make up the body of Jesus Christ in
[1:46:44] flesh again the body of his bride a
[1:46:47] people who overcome just like he
[1:46:49] overcame by the spirit that was inside
[1:46:52] of him him and by the word of his
[1:46:55] testimony it's a people today if we're
[1:46:57] honest and I don't like to paint a dark
[1:46:59] picture but it's a dark scene that's
[1:47:00] living in the most evil time that
[1:47:02] there's ever been on the face of the
[1:47:03] Earth the most troubled time the world
[1:47:06] has ever known the tree of knowledge of
[1:47:08] Good and Evil has absolutely reached its
[1:47:10] height and reached to full maturity the
[1:47:12] Bible tells us that 200 million demons
[1:47:15] have been released from the river
[1:47:16] Euphrates they're under the Sixth Seal
[1:47:18] in Revelation 9 and I say we can see
[1:47:21] them yes they are being made manifest
[1:47:23] all around us I just want to say this if
[1:47:27] the devil can so possess a people that
[1:47:29] you can walk down the street and see his
[1:47:31] influence on their lives what about a
[1:47:33] god what about a God that can so fill
[1:47:35] you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:47:37] that there's a people walking in the
[1:47:39] world today that the world can recognize
[1:47:42] his influence on their life he say
[1:47:44] there's something different about those
[1:47:47] people some people don't want to stick
[1:47:48] out I want to stick
[1:47:51] out I want them to rec recognize there's
[1:47:53] something different there there's an
[1:47:56] influence on that
[1:47:58] life but we're facing the fullness of
[1:48:01] Satan's Legions he's not come in portion
[1:48:05] in this
[1:48:06] age the fullness of his Legions released
[1:48:09] the fullness of evil so in over in order
[1:48:12] to overcome these people you aren't
[1:48:15] going to be given a portion of the word
[1:48:18] he's not going to send you out to face
[1:48:19] the legions of hell with the portion of
[1:48:22] the word you're facing the fullness of
[1:48:24] Hell he's going to give you the fullness
[1:48:26] of the word he's not going to ask you to
[1:48:28] do it with what evening light Tabernacle
[1:48:30] is or what this church is or this Creed
[1:48:32] or this Dogma he says I'm giving you all
[1:48:35] of me I'm giving you everything I'm
[1:48:37] giving you the full revelation of who I
[1:48:40] am my power my might my strength I'm
[1:48:43] giving it to you to face the enemy and
[1:48:45] oh you can have peace I've already
[1:48:47] overcome all this I'm giving you exactly
[1:48:50] what it took for me to be Victorious and
[1:48:52] by that you yourself are going to be
[1:48:55] victorious amen why is it what's the
[1:48:58] scripture mean when the enemy comes in
[1:49:00] like a flood I'll raise a standard you
[1:49:04] are that standard today you are the
[1:49:07] standard being lifted up by the word of
[1:49:09] God that people can look at and say
[1:49:11] there's a still a standard there's still
[1:49:13] a truth there's still a living God in
[1:49:15] this day hallelujah it's prepared for
[1:49:18] this time it's prepared for this moment
[1:49:23] and in this
[1:49:24] day the fullness of the word has been
[1:49:27] restored that we might overcome by the
[1:49:30] word the same way that he did when he
[1:49:32] was on Earth brother Aaron I'm not
[1:49:35] strong brother Aaron I don't have any
[1:49:37] gifts preachers they have gifts and
[1:49:40] deacons are men of God and singers they
[1:49:42] get annoyed I don't have that doesn't
[1:49:45] matter that's not what it's
[1:49:48] about you have the same Authority I have
[1:49:52] you have the same strength I have you're
[1:49:54] stronger than me no I'm
[1:49:55] not no because it's done by the word
[1:49:59] that's listen here how'd the groom do it
[1:50:02] now in his first battle with Satan he
[1:50:05] officially listen close now he
[1:50:07] officially overcame Satan and all of his
[1:50:10] powers by the word of God it is written
[1:50:16] it is written it is
[1:50:19] written whatever he comes and comes and
[1:50:22] attacks you it is written yes he says
[1:50:24] here he defeated Satan on the father's
[1:50:27] word is that right bringing it to show
[1:50:29] that the weakest Christians I'm not

[1:50:45] time to just raise a hand up and say

[1:50:56] perish save me he's looking tonight you

[1:53:51] Satan he defeated him right there on the
[1:53:52] word of God and brought it down to a
[1:53:55] place this is why he did it that

[1:55:19] Satan on any grounds any place anywhere
[1:55:22] anytime that's the word of God will
[1:55:25] defeat the Devil any place brother Aon
[1:55:26] that's like six in a row yep you're
[1:55:28] going to leave here knowing this if you
[1:55:30] know nothing else you're going to know I
[1:55:31] can overcome by the word it don't matter
[1:55:34] where I'm at today I can overcome by the
[1:55:35] word the word of God will defeat Devil
[1:55:38] any place anywhere any time on any
[1:55:40] condition when Jesus was here on Earth
[1:55:42] the father was in him God was in Christ
[1:55:44] reconciling the world to himself we
[1:55:46] believe that all the fine qualities was
[1:55:48] in him well the father was in him but
[1:55:50] when he met Satan look how he did he
[1:55:53] brought it into your reach and yours and
[1:55:56] yours and all of you see he never used
[1:56:01] his great gift you have the greatest
[1:56:04] gift of all the ability to recognize and
[1:56:06] use the word that's the greatest gift
[1:56:10] amen you can use the word that's greater
[1:56:13] than any preacher gift any singing gift
[1:56:16] you can use the word you can put it on
[1:56:19] your lips and you can be an overcomer
[1:56:22] but what about where I'm at any place
[1:56:25] any condition wherever you are this
[1:56:27] morning turn into a place of Victory
[1:56:30] they overcome him by the blood of the
[1:56:31] lamb and the word of their testimony
[1:56:33] there's victory in the word there's joy
[1:56:35] in the word there's healing in the word
[1:56:38] and the groom showed the bride exactly
[1:56:40] how to overcome by the word how did he
[1:56:44] defeat death the word how did he defeat
[1:56:47] hell the word right how did he defeat
[1:56:50] the grave the word
[1:56:53] why did he rise again because the word
[1:56:54] said he was going to rise
[1:56:56] again the word declared it and he looks
[1:56:59] in there and he sees the word that says
[1:57:02] I'm not going to allow my Holy One to
[1:57:03] see corruption that's right and he
[1:57:05] testifies of that word and it becomes
[1:57:08] the word of his
[1:57:10] testimony destroy this temple in three
[1:57:13] days I'll raise it up again think about
[1:57:16] that he found it in the word put it on
[1:57:19] his lips and then it became the word of
[1:57:22] his
[1:57:23] testimony he says Jesus body was
[1:57:26] quickened after it was dead and in the
[1:57:28] grave Jesus body was quickened by the
[1:57:31] word and transformed from a dead cold
[1:57:34] image to a resurrected glorified Son of
[1:57:36] God because the prophet Psalm 16:10 if
[1:57:39] you want to put it down said I will not
[1:57:41] leave his soul in Hell neither will I
[1:57:43] suffer my Holy One to see corruption oh
[1:57:45] God that word has to come to pass it's
[1:57:48] God's word plant it in your heart if you
[1:57:50] want to go in a Rapture if you want to
[1:57:52] be Christians genuine place this word as
[1:57:55] I believe it was Ezekiel God said take
[1:57:57] the scroll eat it up that prophet in the
[1:57:59] word will become the same and every
[1:58:01] promise in there has to manifest itself
[1:58:04] you want to go in a Rapture he says
[1:58:06] plant this seed you want to be an
[1:58:08] overcomer plant this seed take the word
[1:58:10] and plant it in your life it has to come
[1:58:13] to pass it has
[1:58:16] to listen to this I'm going to read the
[1:58:18] second paragraph he says why it was
[1:58:21] prophecy the word word of God and
[1:58:22] prophecy if it's true word of God can
[1:58:25] not fail and the same Prophecy in the
[1:58:28] word of God that said he raised him up
[1:58:30] here we go says we're already raised
[1:58:33] with him no wonder he said fear not it
[1:58:36] is written that the spirit that is now
[1:58:38] was in him now in us also quickens our
[1:58:40] mortal body fear not the Sun is up this
[1:58:43] morning what are you worried about this
[1:58:45] morning he said the same spirit that
[1:58:47] raised Christ from the dead is now
[1:58:49] dwelling in you to Quicken your moral
[1:58:52] body how are we going to overcome by the
[1:58:55] spirit and the word of Our Testimony
[1:58:57] fear not the Sun is up this morning the
[1:59:00] Sun is up this
[1:59:02] morning we could go quote and quote and
[1:59:05] quote I'm going to move on everything is
[1:59:07] done by the
[1:59:09] word that's why the restoration I'm
[1:59:11] bringing this back down that's why the
[1:59:13] restoration of the word was so
[1:59:16] important that's why it was so important
[1:59:19] that's why we have to receive the
[1:59:20] message of this hour amen we couldn't
[1:59:22] overcome with Noah's message we couldn't
[1:59:24] overcome with just the restoration of
[1:59:26] the gifts there is no
[1:59:29] Victory without the
[1:59:31] Restoration in this day there's no
[1:59:34] Victory without our hearts being turned
[1:59:36] back there isn't a spoken word bride
[1:59:38] without the Restoration in this day
[1:59:40] there isn't a Rapture without the
[1:59:42] restoration of the fullness of the word
[1:59:45] think about
[1:59:46] it so in the days of portions of the
[1:59:50] word you you could only have portions of
[1:59:54] him that's right in the days of portions
[1:59:58] you couldn't even receive the fullness
[2:00:00] of the Holy
[2:00:02] Ghost because that portion wasn't
[2:00:05] revealed it wasn't it wasn't revealed
[2:00:07] you can't have his holy spirit without
[2:00:10] accepting the word these two go together
[2:00:13] I don't want to get them separate it's
[2:00:14] like Dynamics and mechanics you can't
[2:00:17] get the Holy Spirit without accepting
[2:00:19] the word and you can't accept the
[2:00:22] fullness of the word without it leading
[2:00:24] you to the holy spirit amen they go hand
[2:00:27] in hand both of them watch this he says
[2:00:31] now the Holy Spirit
[2:00:34] what is the
[2:00:37] word God is not three he's the same God
[2:00:40] in three dispensations just like the
[2:00:42] names we talked
[2:00:44] about he's he is the same God in three
[2:00:47] dispensations three offices God the
[2:00:49] Father over the law God the son and
[2:00:51] Grace God the Holy Ghost as you call it
[2:00:53] the same God in the Holy Ghost
[2:00:55] dispensation God the father was the word
[2:00:58] God the son was the word and God the
[2:01:01] Holy Ghost is the word brother Aon why
[2:01:05] was it so important for the word to be
[2:01:10] restored because it's
[2:01:12] everything if I'm going to overcome by
[2:01:14] the Holy Ghost I can't even get the
[2:01:16] fullness of the Holy Ghost until the
[2:01:18] fullness of the word has been restored
[2:01:20] by the message of the hour see it's just
[2:01:23] three offices and the Holy Ghost seals
[2:01:26] you therefore you're sealed by the
[2:01:31] word why is it so important that we're
[2:01:33] got the truth why is it so important
[2:01:35] that we're not wondering in darkness why
[2:01:37] did God have to send a prophet brother
[2:01:39] Joe you done a great job on that this is
[2:01:42] why the word has to be right the word is
[2:01:45] the Holy Ghost the word is the Father
[2:01:47] the word seals you there has to be a
[2:01:49] people in this day sold out to the word
[2:01:53] of God not Church ideas and church
[2:01:56] anties and family this and dad this and
[2:01:58] this preacher that preacher it's all
[2:02:00] about the word in this day it's all
[2:02:04] about the word that's Martin had light
[2:02:07] Luther had light Wesley had light what
[2:02:10] was that God unfolding himself Through
[2:02:13] the Ages by his Spirit to The Messengers
[2:02:16] until the last day when a message took
[2:02:19] all those loose sins yes
[2:02:22] all the Mysteries and
[2:02:25] testified there's a living God brought
[2:02:29] him up out of History he took the truth
[2:02:31] from Martin the truth of
[2:02:33] Wesley the truth of Luther the truth of
[2:02:37] all these others that had studied some
[2:02:39] of it true some of it wrong he didn't
[2:02:40] throw it all away he took the truth tied
[2:02:44] it all
[2:02:46] together brought it as a
[2:02:48] restoration and said here it is
[2:02:52] here's what you need to overcome if the
[2:02:54] groom overcame by the word and he wants
[2:02:57] the bride to overcome by the word then
[2:02:59] how can he expect you to overcome by the
[2:03:01] word if he don't restore it all the way
[2:03:03] back for you that's if he don't put you
[2:03:05] in the same position he was in because
[2:03:07] he stood as the fullness on he's not
[2:03:09] going to ask the bride to stand here
[2:03:11] with a
[2:03:12] portion he says no I know what it takes
[2:03:14] to overcome it I'm giving it all back to
[2:03:16] you I'm restoring all the word back to
[2:03:19] you listen
[2:03:22] brother brownon makes a
[2:03:23] statement several places and I'm
[2:03:26] paraphrasing so if I don't get it just
[2:03:27] perfect help me forgive me I mean don't
[2:03:29] help me just forgive
[2:03:32] me where he says the evidence of the
[2:03:35] Holy Ghost is that you can accept the
[2:03:36] word for your
[2:03:38] hour and people want to take that and
[2:03:40] say that means if you believe the
[2:03:41] message you got the Holy
[2:03:45] Ghost they take
[2:03:47] that and so what they're saying is if I
[2:03:49] recognize God sent a prophet
[2:03:52] then I've got the
[2:03:53] whole what brother Brand's saying is if
[2:03:56] you're able to take the message of the
[2:04:00] hour out of the hand of the
[2:04:03] angel you're able to look upon the book
[2:04:07] you're able to eat it that's what accept
[2:04:10] it
[2:04:12] means and let it get on the inside of
[2:04:14] you and then your life begins to
[2:04:16] prophesy what the word
[2:04:19] says He says if you can accept the
[2:04:21] message of the what's the message of
[2:04:22] this hour does anybody want to know all
[2:04:24] of
[2:04:24] it all of it it was a portion in Luther
[2:04:27] it was a portion Martin poron in Wesley
[2:04:29] today the message of the hour is all of
[2:04:32] it it's all been revealed So when you
[2:04:34] say all I got to do is receive the
[2:04:36] message truth you got to receive acts
[2:04:38] 238 you got to receive Mark 16 you got
[2:04:41] to receive John 14:12 that's all part of
[2:04:43] the message you got to be filled with
[2:04:45] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you got to
[2:04:47] have your own Upper Room experience
[2:04:49] that's what the message taught so when
[2:04:51] he said say if you can receive the
[2:04:53] message for your day it's the evidence
[2:04:55] of the Holy Ghost he means all of it not
[2:04:58] just that God sent a prophet what did
[2:05:00] the prophet say what did he tell you to
[2:05:02] do eat the book become the book and if
[2:05:06] you're taking Parts up and saying we
[2:05:08] don't need that anymore then you don't
[2:05:09] accept the message for your
[2:05:11] day because the message for your day is
[2:05:14] the whole
[2:05:17] thing it's all of
[2:05:19] it it's every last bit
[2:05:22] this last day message testified he was
[2:05:24] the same yesterday today and forever it
[2:05:27] took all the portions wrapped them into
[2:05:30] one glorious message so it was no longer
[2:05:33] just a
[2:05:35] portion it was the revealed word in the
[2:05:39] fullness that would be called bride amen
[2:05:43] it would call you out yes and then he
[2:05:47] would say I no longer call you church I
[2:05:49] call you bride and people would take
[2:05:52] that word and eat that word and become
[2:05:55] that word and overcome by that word if
[2:05:59] you'll bear with me we're going to turn
[2:06:01] this towards home and take this take
[2:06:03] this towards home
[2:06:05] now they wouldn't be a people that would
[2:06:07] deny any of it that's right they would
[2:06:10] take all of it even the parts that made
[2:06:12] the belly bitter that's there's parts
[2:06:16] that hurt to eat because we have our own
[2:06:19] thinking
[2:06:22] and sometimes it may be sensible it may
[2:06:24] be sane it may seem
[2:06:25] normal but it's got to line up that's
[2:06:30] it's got to line
[2:06:31] up it makes the belly bitter to lay down
[2:06:34] our will makes the belly bitter to
[2:06:37] accept things we don't understand it
[2:06:39] makes us get frustrated when we don't
[2:06:41] get our way human nature he says eat it
[2:06:46] anyway eat it anyway it's going to make
[2:06:49] the belly bitter and that word would
[2:06:51] once again once you eat it would begin
[2:06:53] to be made flesh it would bring a bride
[2:06:57] to a perfect faith for a perfect rapture
[2:07:01] we Rapture by the
[2:07:04] word he says but the Church of the
[2:07:06] Living God that bride moves right on
[2:07:08] just the same and she'll go in the
[2:07:12] Rapture by the word Listen People Get It
[2:07:15] confused sometimes they think well we
[2:07:17] focus on the
[2:07:19] word not on the moving of the spirit or
[2:07:22] the spirit or the emotions you can't
[2:07:25] separate the
[2:07:28] two we've already made it clear he said
[2:07:30] you overcome there was two things the
[2:07:32] blood of the Lamb which we've already
[2:07:35] went through and found is what Spirit
[2:07:38] you got to have the spirit and by the
[2:07:41] word you got to have the word there's no
[2:07:44] separating when we say by the word we
[2:07:45] mean all that's in the word every part
[2:07:48] of it that's right the word and the word
[2:07:52] will come together who's the
[2:07:55] word Jesus and who's the other word the
[2:07:59] bride he said the word and the
[2:08:02] word will come together if we're a part
[2:08:05] of Christ part of it we have to be his
[2:08:08] word wait did he say we have to believe
[2:08:10] his
[2:08:10] word no he said we have to be his word
[2:08:15] that's why you got to eat it that's why
[2:08:17] it's got to become
[2:08:18] yours it's got to become who you are you
[2:08:22] have to be his word because he is the
[2:08:25] word this take all the way back to the
[2:08:26] baptism of the Holy
[2:08:28] Ghost why did he have to die cuz
[2:08:30] somebody just like us had to die so we
[2:08:32] could have his Spirit he can't be United
[2:08:35] with somebody that's not just like him
[2:08:37] that's right so if he's the word you got
[2:08:39] to be the word in order for there to be
[2:08:42] a uniting amen I want to say this I know
[2:08:46] there's a lot of good people who serve
[2:08:48] God to the best of their ability with
[2:08:51] what they they know and with what
[2:08:52] Revelation they've received I take
[2:08:55] nothing from them and nothing from their
[2:08:58] testimony this this this ain't about
[2:09:00] that God blessed them each and every one
[2:09:03] what whatever level of people are in
[2:09:05] their Christian walk I just wish we had
[2:09:06] more
[2:09:07] Christians I'll take it make the world a
[2:09:09] better place I thank God for every
[2:09:12] person who calls on the name of the Lord
[2:09:13] and it gives us some moral compass or
[2:09:15] something I'm thankful for those
[2:09:17] people but if they aren't part of the
[2:09:19] restoration
[2:09:21] then they aren't part of the Overcomers
[2:09:24] of the age there in Revelation 3 they
[2:09:26] aren't part of the ones there in
[2:09:28] Revelation 12 I'm not saying they're not
[2:09:30] good people I'm not saying they won't
[2:09:32] make Heaven what I'm saying is I'm
[2:09:34] preaching to those that overcome him by
[2:09:37] the blood of the lamb and by the word of
[2:09:39] their testimony I'm talking to people
[2:09:41] that are going to go in a Rapture I'm
[2:09:44] talking to people who are part of the
[2:09:45] restoration whose Hearts has been turned
[2:09:49] by the message of Malachi 4 the people
[2:09:52] that have received the word of their day
[2:09:54] people that have received the message of
[2:09:55] the hour who who have received the
[2:09:57] testimony of Jesus Christ in its
[2:10:00] fullness and by that word they're
[2:10:03] standing I want to ask you today how you
[2:10:06] standing how you still here Devil's been
[2:10:09] telling some of you was going to quit a
[2:10:10] long time ago telling you you wern't
[2:10:12] going to make it telling you you wasn't
[2:10:13] going to come back telling you you was
[2:10:15] going to drift away how you still
[2:10:16] standing it ain't by your willpower
[2:10:19] don't give yourself that much credit

[2:10:22] God's holding you you're still here cuz
[2:10:24] The Anchor Holds you're still here

[2:10:28] and we may be in a weary land but the
[2:10:29] Rock is following us and that rock is
[2:10:31] Christ and out of that rock we get water

[2:10:48] Jesus did he didn't fall you're not
[2:10:50] going to fall
[2:10:52] he was tried in everything and he
[2:10:54] overcame every trial and he did it by
[2:10:55] the word the Bible tells us he he was
[2:10:57] tempted in like
[2:11:00] manner so you take that think of the way
[2:11:03] you're tempted don't share
[2:11:06] it I'm just telling you to think
[2:11:10] it the worst thing the worst thought you
[2:11:14] can
[2:11:15] have the worst
[2:11:18] Temptation according to the word he was
[2:11:21] tempted in like
[2:11:23] manner I don't care if nobody in this
[2:11:25] place understands you he
[2:11:29] does I didn't say he gave into it I said
[2:11:31] he was tempted by it it was presented to
[2:11:34] him yes and he overcame it by the word
[2:11:37] and now there's going to be a bride that
[2:11:38] does the exact same thing quit getting
[2:11:41] upset and downtrodden because you get
[2:11:43] tempted Jesus himself was tempted the
[2:11:46] apostles the disciples they were all
[2:11:48] tempted brother Brandon was tempted
[2:11:50] you're going to be tempted Ed but let's
[2:11:52] finish the sentence and you're going to
[2:11:53] overcome the same way he overcame
[2:11:56] because you've got the fullness of the
[2:11:58] word you're Jesus Christ in a body again
[2:12:00] you are predestinated not to fall I'm
[2:12:03] might fall I'm might fall no you're not
[2:12:05] going to fall you're the word you're
[2:12:07] going in a Rapture you're predestined in
[2:12:10] this day to be the Overcomers of the age
[2:12:14] that's who you
[2:12:15] are that's the testimony We
[2:12:19] Believe Hallelujah Overcoming By the
[2:12:22] word yes sir and since we're overcoming
[2:12:25] in this day it's going to take the word
[2:12:27] of this day to meet the
[2:12:30] challenge
[2:12:31] Hallelujah the restoration gave us the
[2:12:34] fullness of the word and because of that
[2:12:36] we have the fullness of the spirit all
[2:12:39] the
[2:12:40] Dynamics all the
[2:12:43] mechanics and it's our
[2:12:46] testimony this
[2:12:49] message is our testimony yes listen
[2:12:52] brother Brown we know we're at the end
[2:12:54] time and the people need strength Satan
[2:12:58] is charging at them and I'm putting the
[2:13:00] word of God in their hands right now in
[2:13:03] their hearts we defeat Satan with this
[2:13:07] word amen It's the final voice to the
[2:13:10] final age speaking the word yes if he
[2:13:14] was if he was the fullness of the word
[2:13:15] then what then is the BR bone of his
[2:13:18] bone flesh of his flesh power of his
[2:13:19] power she is him so she is the
[2:13:22] manifestation of the word how can we say
[2:13:25] anything else but the word when we are
[2:13:27] the word how can we do anything but the
[2:13:30] word when we are the word that's
[2:13:33] Hallelujah he says the word and her are
[2:13:36] the same as a man and his wife become
[2:13:38] one in Union so does the real genuine
[2:13:40] Church of God when he comes in Christ
[2:13:43] the Bible is punctuated with an amen
[2:13:45] every promise don't make any difference
[2:13:46] what the denomination says the soul
[2:13:48] that's in The Believer punctuate it
[2:13:50] because it it is the word in him
[2:13:53] speaking
[2:13:55] out if we're speaking something what are
[2:13:57] we speaking the word now if we are those
[2:14:00] attributes of God we cannot live by
[2:14:02] Creeds we cannot live by denominations
[2:14:04] we must live by the word because the
[2:14:06] bride is part of the bridegroom like any
[2:14:09] wife is part of her husband therefore we
[2:14:10] must be that word bride and what is that
[2:14:13] word bride the manifestation of this
[2:14:16] hour you talk about responsibility and
[2:14:18] you talk about benefits we are the
[2:14:20] Manifest ation of this hour the bride
[2:14:23] not a Creed or denomination but a living
[2:14:25] Oracle of God a living attribute of God
[2:14:28] displaying to the world the attributes
[2:14:31] of God in the formation of the Bride
[2:14:33] that's to be expressed in this hour that
[2:14:36] we're now living in church that should
[2:14:38] excite you that's who you are that's
[2:14:41] what you are that's what your
[2:14:43] responsibility is that's what he gave
[2:14:45] you the fullness of the restoration of
[2:14:47] the word for and to be attributes of him
[2:14:51] manifested to the
[2:14:52] world we have no other testimony we have
[2:14:56] no other Revelation he says that's my
[2:14:59] message to you Church you that's a union
[2:15:02] spiritual union by the word that you're
[2:15:04] dead to these old husbands you're born a
[2:15:06] new don't try to dig him up he's dead if
[2:15:09] you're a born again Christian that
[2:15:10] little germ that was predestinated to
[2:15:12] you it's word coming on word on word on
[2:15:16] word on word until it comes to the full
[2:15:18] stature of Christ that's right so he can
[2:15:21] come and get his bride how can we speak
[2:15:25] anything else how can we be saying
[2:15:27] anything
[2:15:29] else why couldn't Jesus fail brother
[2:15:31] Aaron Jesus couldn't fail because he was
[2:15:32] the word and the word can't fail and now
[2:15:34] the word is made flesh again and the
[2:15:36] bride is the very Body of Christ on the
[2:15:38] earth I want to tell you again you can't
[2:15:42] fail if Jesus couldn't fail then you
[2:15:44] can't fail he made sure that you weren't
[2:15:47] going to come up short he made sure that
[2:15:49] you weren't going to fail he made sure
[2:15:51] you weren't going to end up in the
[2:15:52] tribulation he sent back everything you
[2:15:54] had need of he sent back everything you
[2:15:57] had need to make it he said I'm going to
[2:15:59] prepare a place for you and I'm not
[2:16:00] doing it for nothing I'm going to make
[2:16:02] sure you're there I'm not making this
[2:16:04] beautiful city for me to hang out in all
[2:16:06] alone but I'm going to have a bride and
[2:16:08] I'm going to make sure she gets there

[2:16:19] Temptation she'll heal the she'll
[2:16:21] deliver the bound Hallelujah she will
[2:16:23] show the attributes of a living God to a

[2:16:42] parts the blood of the Lamb the life and

[2:18:01] I thought I'd gone too far God said nope
[2:18:04] you hadn't gone too far from me how
[2:18:05] frustrating it must be for the devil to
[2:18:08] pour decade after decade after decade
[2:18:10] into a life and say I've got them I
[2:18:13] spent 30 years on this one and then in
[2:18:15] one moment's time God says no that was

[2:20:36] going to hear it anymore he says you're
[2:20:38] done accusing you're done lying my
[2:20:40] blood's already paid for it my blood's
[2:20:42] already settled the debt you are done
[2:20:45] you're the accuser of the Brethren now
[2:20:47] get out get out he's bound up and he's
[2:20:50] cast out of heaven and it says now has
[2:20:53] come salvation and strength in the
[2:20:55] Kingdom of our God Satan has been cast
[2:20:58] down you've been accused for the last
[2:21:02] time he says I found you to be a false
[2:21:04] accuser the witness is a liar and his
[2:21:07] testimony is
[2:21:08] false but then our testimony is
[2:21:14] examined what do we
[2:21:17] say how do we over
[2:21:21] overcome but see
[2:21:23] it's it's a rigged
[2:21:26] court because we were given the
[2:21:27] questions ahead of time and we have the
[2:21:30] answer to the devil's
[2:21:32] question he already told us what to say
[2:21:36] he said just say what I
[2:21:37] said he said take the book we're back in
[2:21:40] chapter 10 take it open it up eat it and
[2:21:46] then when it comes time for you to
[2:21:48] testify you know exactly what to say
[2:21:52] you know exactly what to say our
[2:21:55] testimony is what was in the open
[2:21:58] book and they overcame him by the blood
[2:22:01] of the lamb and by the word of their
[2:22:04] testimony and they love not their lives
[2:22:07] unto the death what's that mean we laid
[2:22:08] our lives
[2:22:09] down we took the book we said let this
[2:22:12] be our
[2:22:13] life and what was in the open
[2:22:16] book the message of the hour was our
[2:22:19] testimony our testimony is the word but
[2:22:22] how could we speak it if it wasn't
[2:22:24] restored and how could it be restored if
[2:22:26] God hadn't sent a prophet so we made
[2:22:29] sure that you had the testimony you
[2:22:30] needed to answer the devil's questions
[2:22:33] Our Testimony we know is true because
[2:22:36] God already spoke it and it's his word
[2:22:39] in our mouth and his word can't lie we
[2:22:43] can say what God said because we've
[2:22:44] already had a Vindicated prophet in this
[2:22:46] day tell us exactly what the testimony
[2:22:49] was he already
[2:22:51] tore it open and said look at it eat it
[2:22:55] we ate it
[2:22:57] up and now we're saying what the word
[2:23:00] said don't be on the side of the
[2:23:03] accuser don't speak what the accuser
[2:23:06] speaks but when you eat that
[2:23:08] book and he says okay what's their
[2:23:11] testimony we begin to say I'm
[2:23:14] saved I'm Healed I'm delivered I'm the
[2:23:18] bride I'm called I'm chosen I was in him
[2:23:22] before the foundation of the world I
[2:23:24] never did it in the first place I'm
[2:23:26] going in the Rapture I'm not guilty
[2:23:28] everything he ever said is false I'm an
[2:23:30] overcomer I'm going to make it I'm
[2:23:32] delivered the blood has Set Me Free the
[2:23:34] blood has loosed me I'm going to make it
[2:23:36] I'm going to Rapture I'm going up what
