[21:31] together in
[21:33] prayer amen we just uh kind of an honor
[21:37] to be here tonight to serve the Lord
[21:39] with you I do have a praise report many
[21:41] of you know that Caroline I called her
[21:43] up Sunday for prayer she had a spot on
[21:46] her neck and she's had it there for
[21:47] about three or four months kind of scaly
[21:50] very uh kind of nasty looking spot on
[21:52] her neck probably about 2 Ines long very
[21:55] red irritated and uh and she asked me
[21:59] the Saturday night she says Papa if you
[22:01] would just pray for my neck uh you know
[22:03] it's just not wanting it there it's a
[22:05] lot of irritation well brother Andrew
[22:08] Glover sent me a a quote which I read to
[22:10] you in uh the night of that Sunday
[22:12] morning he sent it Sunday morning right
[22:14] before I walked out so I slipped it into
[22:15] the sermon into the uh testimony Series
[22:18] right there how that that young boy came
[22:21] up and they cursed that thing and you
[22:23] know he come back the next night and all
[22:25] the the eczema or the soris was gone
[22:28] well we woke up yesterday morning and
[22:30] also this morning in Carolina I said let
[22:32] me look at your neck when you look at
[22:34] her neck right now which was very red
[22:36] and very scaly and only just a little
[22:38] dot that's left everything else is
[22:40] pretty much clear so she's about 99%
[22:42] clear so God's already moved and if he
[22:44] can move on the scene for a young child
[22:46] in that need truly to you that came in
[22:48] the prayer line and you that have needs
[22:50] tonight he's the same God then we took
[22:52] it back to the scripture over and over
[22:54] and over and over on Sunday showing that
[22:56] he is the same if he's ever healed you
[22:59] then he's also got to be a Healer today
[23:01] you know if we can just have the
[23:02] appropriate the right amount of faith
[23:04] and touch God you know touch him of his
[23:06] gourment for whatever your need is need
[23:08] for your family need for your home he's
[23:10] the same God and so we're just going to
[23:12] believe tonight for these needs and also
[23:15] let's special pray for the tager family
[23:18] they dealing with two young boys who are
[23:20] autistic and you know they're maybe not
[23:23] like your kids who are very well
[23:25] obedient can understand things but you
[23:27] know they need a touch God's brought
[23:30] them here for a purpose I don't believe
[23:31] God does any none of us are here by
[23:33] happen stance or mistake God brought
[23:35] them here because there's healing in the
[23:36] house of God and know I believe there's
[23:38] healing is preached Deliverance is
[23:40] preached the Supernatural is preached I
[23:42] believe they're in the right place so
[23:43] let's make sure that we formulate the
[23:45] right attitude that that healing can
[23:47] take place so if you got a need tonight
[23:49] let's take our needs Before the Throne

[39:21] we took a few moments and kind of kind
[39:25] of stole your pastor away for a little
[39:27] bit and got him up into some mountains
[39:29] just with some friends and things just
[39:32] to have a few days away and had a good
[39:34] time but we're always good glad to be
[39:36] back to the house of the Lord you know
[39:38] how it is you can go away and have a
[39:40] good time but that day getting back

[39:44] but we're glad to be here tonight and
[39:47] and um sure thankful um to be serving
[39:52] him today in the time that we're living
[39:53] in it's the closing moments of time we
[39:56] believe we see prophecies that are being
[39:58] fulfilled and and uh so we believe at
[40:01] any moment we'll see the prophecy be
[40:03] fulfilled of the Dead in Christ that
[40:05] arise and we'll be changed to go be with
[40:08] them amen throughout eternity what a day
[40:10] that'll be looking forward to that time
[40:13] just want to look here in Jude chapter 1
[40:16] and verse three and sorry but I'm going
[40:18] to have to read the whole rest of the
[40:20] chapter here but just bear with me
[40:22] beloved when I gave all diligence to
[40:24] write unto you of the common salvation
[40:27] it was needful for me to write unto you
[40:29] and exhort you that you should earnestly
[40:32] contend for the faith which was once
[40:34] delivered into the Saints for there are
[40:37] certain men crept in unawares who were
[40:39] before of old ordained to this
[40:41] condemnation ungodly men turning the
[40:44] grace of our God into Las seriousness
[40:46] and denying the only Lord God and our
[40:49] Lord Jesus Christ I will therefore put
[40:52] you in remembrance though you once knew
[40:54] this how that the Lord having saved the
[40:56] people out of the the land of Egypt
[40:58] afterward destroyed them that believe
[41:00] not and the angels which kept not their
[41:02] first estate but left their own own
[41:05] habitation he has reserved an
[41:07] everlasting chains under Darkness unto
[41:09] the Judgment of the great day and even
[41:11] as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities
[41:13] about them in like manner giving
[41:15] themselves over to fornication and going
[41:17] after strange flesh or set forth for an
[41:20] example suffering the Vengeance of
[41:22] Eternal fire likewise also these filthy
[41:25] dreamers defile the FL flesh despise
[41:28] Dominion speak evil dignities Yet
[41:31] Michael the Archangel when contending
[41:33] with the devil he disputed about the
[41:35] body of Moses D not bring against him a
[41:37] ra railen accusation but said the Lord
[41:40] rebuke thee but they speak evil of those
[41:43] things which they know not but they but
[41:45] what they know naturally is brute beasts
[41:47] and those things they corrupt themselves
[41:50] woe unto them for they've gone the way
[41:52] of Cain ran greedily after the heir of
[41:54] balam for reward and perished in the
[41:56] gain say and of core these are spots in
[42:00] your Feast of Charity when they Feast
[42:02] with you feeding themselves without fear
[42:04] clouds there are without water carried
[42:06] about of winds trees whose fruit
[42:09] wherewith with without fruit twice dead
[42:12] plucked up by the roots Raging Waves of
[42:14] the sea foaming out of the shame
[42:16] wondering stars to whom is reserved the
[42:19] Blackness of Darkness forever and Enoch
[42:22] also the seventh from abam prophesied of
[42:24] these saying behold the Lord cometh with
[42:27] 10,000 of his Saints to execute judgment
[42:30] upon all to convince all that are
[42:31] ungodly among them of all their ungodly
[42:33] Deeds which they have ungodly committed
[42:36] and all of their hard speeches which
[42:38] ungodly Sinners have spoken against him
[42:41] these are murmurers complainers walking
[42:43] after their own lust their mouth
[42:44] speaking great swelling words having
[42:46] men's persons in admiration because of
[42:49] Advantage but beloved remember ye The
[42:52] Words which are spoken before the
[42:54] Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ how
[42:56] that they told you there should be
[42:58] mockers in the last time who walk after
[43:00] the ungodly lust these be they who are
[43:03] separate them separate separate
[43:05] themselves sensual having not the spirit
[43:08] but ye beloved building up yourselves on
[43:10] the Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy
[43:12] Ghost keep yourself in the love of God
[43:15] looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus
[43:17] Christ into eternal life and if some
[43:20] have compassion making a difference and
[43:22] others Sav with fear pulling them out of
[43:24] the fire hateth even the garments
[43:27] spotted by the flesh but now unto him
[43:29] that is able to keep you from falling
[43:32] and to present you faultless before the
[43:34] presence of his glory with exceeding Joy
[43:37] to the only wise God our savior be glory
[43:41] and Majesty Dominion power both now and
[43:44] ever amen amen God bless you you can be
[43:51] seated I don't know uh probably just
[43:55] looking at these scriptures and been
[43:56] pondering on them most of the day and or
[44:00] more than that but just especially today
[44:03] thinking about things may be on the
[44:05] scripture a minute a few Services we'll
[44:07] have to see but I I I'd like to uh speak
[44:11] to you tonight on the lifeline of Faith
[44:14] the lifeline of faith and you know as we
[44:16] read here as Jude was was speaking about
[44:20] two groups of people he was speaking
[44:21] about those who even those who started
[44:24] but fell away and and and the angel that
[44:27] were once Angels were were now reserved
[44:29] and changed and he spoke about Sodom and
[44:32] gomorra and how that you know all of
[44:34] their filth and things and boy if we
[44:36] ain't back to where that is today I
[44:38] don't know where we're at because we see
[44:40] the world that is very quickly going
[44:44] more and more in that direction but you
[44:46] know but he comes all the way down in
[44:48] that and he talks about those that are
[44:49] falling away and those who will fall
[44:51] away and murmur complainers all of that
[44:53] but then he begins to speak about
[44:55] another group amen that had been had
[44:57] heard the word of God the faith of God
[44:59] had been delivered to them and and and
[45:02] they they were they were separated they
[45:04] they wasn't on sensual things or fleshly
[45:07] things their mind was not upon the Earth
[45:09] but it was on the spirit of God and the
[45:11] things of God and and and he says he
[45:14] wanted us to keep oursel in the love of
[45:16] God and and looking for the mercy of our
[45:19] Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life and
[45:22] he speaks about how that we would make a
[45:23] difference on some having compassion
[45:25] others will pull out of the fire at the
[45:27] last moments but then he speaks directly
[45:30] to the Church of God he says now unto
[45:33] him that is able to keep you from
[45:35] falling he spoke about all these others
[45:37] that fail but he says there going to be
[45:39] a group of people that will not fail
[45:42] that will not fall amen amen that will
[45:44] not go down in the same places these
[45:47] others have went now I understand you
[45:49] can fall you can make mistakes and you
[45:51] have to get back up again but there's
[45:53] the but the falling he is speaking about
[45:54] as living in sin amen abiding in sin
[45:58] walking in sin amen I believe that that
[46:00] the word of God speaks that we can't
[46:02] have the Holy Ghost and do those kind of
[46:04] things amen but the god that comes
[46:06] inside of you will keep you from falling
[46:08] into those kind of places amen but he
[46:11] said we are to contend for the faith
[46:13] that was once delivered and this Faith
[46:16] amen as we'll get into it is a Lifeline
[46:18] of the Church of the Living God but
[46:20] we're so a Lifeline is something that's
[46:22] very important and we'll read the
[46:23] definition of that but if it's something
[46:25] that's important you know you don't
[46:27] fight unless there's something forth
[46:29] fighting about you ever heard the saying
[46:31] that's a hill I'm willing to die on you
[46:33] know there's a place I'm willing to
[46:35] stand there other other things you may
[46:37] allow to just go this way or that way
[46:39] and may not may not say nothing about it
[46:41] but there's spots in your life sometimes
[46:43] you have to make a stand you you have to
[46:46] stand there and you're willing to die on
[46:48] that place because you believe it's
[46:49] worth fighting about and and and he's
[46:52] what he was speaking to the Church of
[46:53] God he said this faith that has been
[46:56] delivered is worth fighting for it's
[46:58] worth fighting to keep it's worth
[47:00] fighting to hold on to amen that's what
[47:02] it means it means to fight to struggle
[47:04] to strive to to contend to fight as in a
[47:08] as in a war the the antonym to that is
[47:10] to keep peace or be at peace or
[47:13] reconciliation or or to tolerate
[47:15] something or just be quiet but amen I
[47:17] believe when it comes to the faith of
[47:19] the Church of the Living God I believe
[47:21] we ought to fight for that we ought to
[47:23] fight Amen to have that Faith that's
[47:25] been delivered to the saint
[47:27] now he says one thing brother M I'm
[47:29] bringing this he says one thing I'd like
[47:30] to mention and something that's gone out
[47:33] from our church he says one of the main
[47:35] things is Faith he says people don't
[47:37] have faith today like they used to have
[47:39] in that day he says some kind of worm or
[47:42] something has got in and eat off the
[47:44] lifeline of Faith it's eat off the
[47:47] lifeline of Faith they've changed it
[47:49] today their faith rest upon maybe a big
[47:51] church or a denomination or an idea or
[47:54] you know maybe your faith really rest
[47:56] upon well I believe the message listen
[47:58] it's more than just believing a message
[48:00] it's more than just an intellectual
[48:02] conception of the message amen I know
[48:04] brother brand said that amen that the
[48:06] evidence of the Holy Ghost is accepting
[48:08] every word for your age but he was not
[48:10] talking about an intellectual
[48:12] understanding or intellectual conception
[48:14] because if you if you if you take it by
[48:16] the intellect sooner or later the word's
[48:19] going to come against your intellect
[48:21] you're going to come against what you
[48:22] think or what you want or what your
[48:24] ideas is so it's not accepting it by an
[48:27] intellectual conception but it's a
[48:29] revelation of Jesus Christ on the inside
[48:32] of your heart that was not given to you
[48:34] by flesh and blood but was given to you
[48:36] by the spirit of the Living God Amen
[48:38] that's what we're looking at that is the
[48:40] lifeline but they've changed it you know
[48:42] a Lifeline is a a line such as a rope
[48:45] it's used for saving or preserving life
[48:47] it's a line along the you know out of
[48:50] the on the outer edge of a deck of a
[48:53] boat that you know like a railing that
[48:55] you would go against you know you can't
[48:56] shouldn't go no further than that it's a
[48:58] a line is used to keep contact with a
[49:01] person you know there's they use it in
[49:03] divers or in in astronauts they get out
[49:05] of a ship in in space and they have a
[49:07] Lifeline that is connecting them to the
[49:09] mother's ship or or if they're diving
[49:11] they'll have a Lifeline that's connected
[49:13] them amen because they're going into
[49:15] another they're living in another world
[49:16] and so it's dangerous to be living in
[49:18] that world down there without connected
[49:20] to the
[49:22] lifeline come on somebody also it's
[49:25] dangerous to be living in this world and
[49:27] not connected to the lifeline amen
[49:30] there's a throne of grace up there and
[49:32] there's a Lifeline that's been extended
[49:34] to everyone that can gra by faith grab a
[49:36] hold of it and receive the Holy Ghost
[49:38] you're connected to that throne and
[49:41] therefore you can go through hard times
[49:43] you can go through dangerous times you
[49:45] can go through problems in your life but
[49:47] you're connected not to your feelings
[49:49] not to what you think but you're
[49:51] connected to the lifeline and it's
[49:53] regarded as something that's
[49:55] indispensable for m maintaining
[49:57] protection of Life come on now it's
[50:00] regarded as something that's
[50:02] indispensable for maintaining the
[50:05] protection of life amen and this is what
[50:07] the Holy Ghost is to the church it is a
[50:11] Lifeline hallelujah it's the connection
[50:14] between the natural and the supernatural
[50:16] amen between you and God it is your
[50:19] connection he said I can't be with you
[50:21] always I must go away but I will come
[50:24] again and I will come in the form of the
[50:26] Holy Ghost and he'll be with you even in
[50:29] you to the end of the world so it is a
[50:31] connection it's a lifeline and that's
[50:33] the very Lifeline of the church is the
[50:36] spirit of the Living God no wonder why
[50:38] the devil fights against it no wonder
[50:40] why he tries to tell us we don't need to
[50:42] move in another Spirit we don't need we
[50:44] just need to accept the word and we just
[50:46] you know it just becomes an intellectual
[50:48] conception why because he knows he can
[50:50] beat you on your intellects but he
[50:52] cannot defeat that lifeline
[50:56] hallelujah amen is a Lifeline of the
[50:59] church it is a connection it is
[51:01] connecting us between us and the
[51:03] supernatural you know and so is it's you
[51:06] know so Satan is there to try to direct
[51:09] our faith to a day gone by or or settle
[51:12] in a time in the future and we lose amen
[51:15] because we lose the faith for today and
[51:18] this is what we need we need faith for
[51:21] today amen you know if a guy's getting
[51:24] out of a ship and he's he's getting out
[51:26] into a place that has no oxygen he don't
[51:28] need oxygen for
[51:31] tomorrow he needs oxygen for right now
[51:34] if a guy's diving down into the ocean
[51:36] and he gets down in the bottom he's not
[51:38] needing oxygen tomorrow he's needing it
[51:40] right now amen so we're not needing amen
[51:44] Divine Healing tomorrow or the Holy
[51:46] Ghost tomorrow or signs and wonders
[51:48] tomorrow we're not needing that tomorrow
[51:51] or it ain't just yesterday amen we're
[51:53] needing it right now amen I believe we
[51:56] have a God who can heal right now we
[51:59] have a God who can he can save right now
[52:02] we have a God that can fill with the
[52:03] Holy Ghost right
[52:07] now but Jude told us beloved I give all
[52:10] diligence to write unto you so Jude
[52:13] thought it was important that he wrote
[52:15] this and brother Brandon would bring it
[52:17] all the way down he says he said now
[52:18] this was for all the church ages but I
[52:20] he said I believe it is especially for
[52:23] us okay amen he says he said it is
[52:27] needful for me to write unto you I I and
[52:30] to exhort you that you should earnestly
[52:32] contend for the faith not a faith the
[52:37] faith not a faith the fa faith that was
[52:40] once delivered to the saints that was 33
[52:43] years before the faith was that then
[52:45] when the faith was delivered see there's
[52:46] only one Faith one Lord One Faith one
[52:49] baptism we might have a faith but we
[52:52] want the faith earnestly contend he said
[52:55] that's to argue for it that's to stand
[52:57] up for it that's to that's to rise up
[53:00] and take it for
[53:03] yourself earnestly contend for the faith
[53:06] that was once delivered to the Saints he
[53:09] says when were they called Saints when
[53:11] they were Sanctified and when the Holy
[53:13] Ghost came down and Sanctified they
[53:15] called him Saints now Jude says amen he
[53:19] said I want to ear I want you to
[53:20] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[53:22] once delivered to the Saints and he he
[53:25] says this and he says don't
[53:26] never let that Faith
[53:30] drop don't never let that Faith drop the
[53:33] faith of the Saints is not in Creeds
[53:37] it's not in denominational it's not in a
[53:39] church building it's not in your
[53:43] Association well I associate with people
[53:45] in the message that ain't where the
[53:46] faith lies amen I associate under the
[53:49] name of the of a message believer that's
[53:51] not where the faith lies but it lies he
[53:54] says in the presence of the Living
[53:57] God in the presence of the Living God
[54:00] they in that presence they had Faith to
[54:03] heal the
[54:04] sick come on now it's direct quote they
[54:07] had Faith to cast out Devils they had
[54:09] Faith to do Miracles all the great
[54:12] promises that Jesus made the first

[57:59] listening to I will not compromise amen
[58:02] they're look at what they're feeding on
[58:04] I'm not going to compromise amen I'm not
[58:06] going to compromise on Creeds or prayer
[58:08] books or what somebody else has
[58:11] said hello somebody what somebody else
[58:14] has said there's plenty of other people
[58:17] that has that has a you know brother was
[58:19] it brother Daniel Williams talked about
[58:20] that he said opinions are like noses
[58:22] everybody's got one
[58:26] we all got
[58:28] opinions but we want
[58:30] God's
[58:33] opinion amen you know but he said
[58:36] because why my faith is built on nothing
[58:38] less than Jesus blood with righteousness
[58:42] All Around My Soul gives way but he's My
[58:44] Hope and stay for on Christ the solid
[58:46] rock I stand all of the grounds are
[58:48] sinking say no Creed but Christ no law
[58:51] but love no book but the Bible no Creed
[58:53] books the Bible has to say it the Bible
[58:55] has for because if the Bible does not
[58:58] the Bible has to not only say it but
[59:00] it's to say it every time the same it
[59:02] must say it from generation to Genesis
[59:04] to Revelations it must go in every
[59:07] little web and weave in every part of
[59:08] the word if it doesn't then I got the
[59:10] wrong
[59:13] interpretation amen people want to make
[59:15] the quote say something another what the
[59:17] Bible
[59:18] says come on something somebody if it
[59:21] ain't in the
[59:22] Bible it's not the message
[59:28] hello somebody amen that's what the
[59:30] message came to do it came to bring the
[59:32] revelation of Jesus Christ in this
[59:35] day and he's the same yesterday today
[59:38] and forever so if it's not here and or
[59:41] if it's not there it's not
[59:43] here but if it is the same there then
[59:46] it's the same
[59:52] here got the wrong interpretation
[59:55] because God can not dis dispute his own
[59:59] word if it doesn't say the same thing to
[1:00:02] every little
[1:00:05] fiber he said you know he's talking
[1:00:07] about his shirt he said if it's wo
[1:00:08] throughout with the same fiber it's what
[1:00:10] makes it what it is said what makes it
[1:00:13] white he must have been wearing a white
[1:00:14] shirt I'm wearing a blue one is but it's
[1:00:16] what makes it what it is it's what the
[1:00:18] church is if it's going to be a church
[1:00:21] born again without spot without wrinkle
[1:00:24] it's got to be woven with the same kind
[1:00:26] of fiber that started off on the day of
[1:00:33] Pentecost I know it hurts a lot of
[1:00:35] message theologians feelings they want
[1:00:37] well we got something different now no
[1:00:40] we got the same
[1:00:42] material he said it's the Holy Ghost he
[1:00:45] said it's same kind of fiber that has
[1:00:47] started off on the day of Pentecost the
[1:00:50] Holy Ghost
[1:00:53] experience burning and weaving
[1:00:55] throughout all of
[1:00:57] it hello somebody you can't add a piece
[1:01:01] of rotten good to
[1:01:02] it I want you to understand your ideas
[1:01:05] and what you think it ought to be it's
[1:01:06] rotten Goods God's not going to have
[1:01:09] that in his church he's going to weave
[1:01:11] it with Holy Ghost experiences burning
[1:01:15] and weaving it all the way there you
[1:01:17] can't add a piece of burlap sack to it
[1:01:19] it won't work it'll Mar it
[1:01:26] but some kind of little cankerworm came
[1:01:28] in and it ate that
[1:01:31] Lifeline that Faith
[1:01:34] off and they begin to stand up that
[1:01:36] church what Jud was see seeing he's like
[1:01:39] look he says here I see you falling
[1:01:42] away and I'm going to remind you what
[1:01:44] happened to others that fell this
[1:01:47] way and he reminded them of all the ones
[1:01:49] there walked out of Egypt with a high
[1:01:51] hand but sooner later they started they
[1:01:53] come out with a mental in intellectual
[1:01:55] concern deception and by the time they
[1:01:57] got through they were they wasn't they
[1:01:59] was they was all they was lost and gone
[1:02:02] and died in a
[1:02:08] desert said as he saw them as they begin
[1:02:11] to move and pretty soon they begin to
[1:02:13] say I believe in the holy church the
[1:02:15] Holy Roman Catholic Church this is where
[1:02:18] they went to because they didn't
[1:02:20] earnestly consent for what was brought
[1:02:23] there and it was lost throughout the
[1:02:24] Dark Ages
[1:02:27] but it was brought back in this
[1:02:29] day hello somebody that Holy Ghost that
[1:02:33] Pillar of Fire showed up again in this
[1:02:35] day and now it's under our it's under
[1:02:39] our time and it's under our moment to
[1:02:41] don't lose what we
[1:02:44] got what's been given to us but to
[1:02:47] earnestly contend for he said I I
[1:02:49] believe in Jesus Christ the son of God I
[1:02:52] believe he's the same yesterday today
[1:02:54] and forever and the faith and the power
[1:02:56] of his resurrection lives within me
[1:02:58] today because he lives I will live also
[1:03:02] not because of a Creed not because of a
[1:03:05] denomination but because Christ
[1:03:09] lives and I'm in Christ and I live by
[1:03:12] him and with him and I live through him
[1:03:14] and his life fibers itself through me I
[1:03:16] love that his life fibers itself through
[1:03:19] me if I if it don't then I can call I
[1:03:22] can't call myself
[1:03:24] his he just don't take my head he takes
[1:03:28] everything takes my heart he takes my
[1:03:31] movements he takes everything and he
[1:03:32] weaves himself into every part of
[1:03:37] it hello that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:03:40] wants to do he wants to weave himself
[1:03:43] into every part of your
[1:03:46] body he weaves himself into the word and
[1:03:48] the word can't say one thing one place
[1:03:50] and say something else another aren't
[1:03:52] you glad to have a word like that I'm
[1:03:55] glad no I can read in this side over
[1:03:57] here that God called me before the
[1:03:58] foundation of the world and I can read
[1:04:00] over here and he still called me he
[1:04:03] didn't get over here and it changed his
[1:04:04] mind about me hallelujah amen matter of
[1:04:08] fact it actually it actually if I can
[1:04:10] say it amen what was the Shadows became
[1:04:13] amen became reality because over in the
[1:04:15] shadows of types and shadows you can see
[1:04:17] Abraham who lied Abraham who done wrong
[1:04:20] Abraham went down and things he
[1:04:21] shouldn't have done but when it was a
[1:04:23] changing of the
[1:04:24] Covenant the cross of God the blood of
[1:04:27] that lamb when it came down you can read
[1:04:29] about Abraham in the New Testament you
[1:04:31] can't find one time where he
[1:04:34] lied you can't find one time where he
[1:04:36] went somewhere and he did something
[1:04:38] wrong but the blood covered it
[1:04:40] all Hallelujah the blood said about
[1:04:44] Abraham it said Abraham staggered not at
[1:04:46] the promises of God but was strong in
[1:04:48] the
[1:04:51] faith hallelujah amen the devil wants to
[1:04:54] tell you you're still under the blood
[1:04:56] many times when he's trying to tell you
[1:04:57] you're not worthy you're not worthy
[1:04:59] you're not worthy you know what he's
[1:05:00] telling you you're under the blood of
[1:05:02] bulls and goats but we are not under the
[1:05:03] blood of bulls and goats cuz it's not
[1:05:05] dependent upon our worthiness it's
[1:05:07] depending upon our lamb and the lamb is
[1:05:10] found worthy therefore I am found
[1:05:14] worthy and the life of that lamb can now
[1:05:16] come and weave himself through every
[1:05:19] fiber of our
[1:05:22] body and just as it gave him overcoming
[1:05:28] power come on somebody sir amen it gave
[1:05:32] him overcoming power and he was driven
[1:05:34] into the Wilderness and he withstand the
[1:05:36] devil at every one of his moves amen
[1:05:38] it'll give you the same overcoming power
[1:05:41] if you'll just let him weave himself
[1:05:42] down into your body it'll make you walk
[1:05:45] over every devil it'll make you walk
[1:05:47] over every sin you won't go back why cuz
[1:05:50] you can't go back
[1:05:59] can't say one thing one place and
[1:06:01] something else
[1:06:02] another if it overcome in him it'll
[1:06:04] overcome in
[1:06:08] you amen let's contend for that
[1:06:11] Faith somehow we got a idea of a weaker
[1:06:13] Holy Ghost in This Hour we ain't got no
[1:06:16] weaker Holy
[1:06:18] Ghost you can get the Holy Ghost and
[1:06:20] still be in pornography and still
[1:06:23] baloney you ain't let him come in your
[1:06:25] life
[1:06:30] yet come on now he weaves himself into
[1:06:33] the word the word can't say one thing
[1:06:37] and then another place somewhere else
[1:06:39] Jesus said so thank god with that he hid
[1:06:41] it from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[1:06:44] because it's written that way for a
[1:06:45] purpose but it because it will be
[1:06:47] revealed unto babes that such will learn
[1:06:50] that's God's purpose in doing so now we
[1:06:52] can take our churches today and look oh
[1:06:54] well look look at the pentec Al to
[1:06:55] people look at the Baptist people look
[1:06:57] look at the

[1:07:06] us look that look at even light

[1:07:26] one to get on one side and the other on
[1:07:27] the other
[1:07:31] side is is that contending for the faith
[1:07:33] that wants to deliver to the church does
[1:07:35] that not that that sound does that sound
[1:07:37] like Apostolic Doctrine no sir
[1:07:40] brother he said that's not earnestly
[1:07:42] contending people go out today and say
[1:07:44] well my faith don't teach Miracles and
[1:07:46] they they they teach the days of
[1:07:48] Miracles are past then you're not

[1:08:53] said but oh I know there's a bunch of
[1:08:55] fanaticism but I believe there's a real
[1:08:57] genuine gift of the Holy
[1:09:00] Ghost and we earnestly contend for that

[1:09:08] tongues well I don't believe in Divine
[1:09:10] Healing I don't believe in a but I don't

[1:10:03] God well he said I've seen a lot called
[1:10:05] discernment I don't believe in sure but
[1:10:08] I know there's truly a Discerning spirit
[1:10:10] of
[1:10:11] God and the word is still the discerner
[1:10:14] of the thoughts and intents of the
[1:10:20] heart sometimes you know you decide you
[1:10:23] feel like you need to do something pick
[1:10:25] up a phone call and you call somebody

[1:10:50] something in me to do something and
[1:10:53] before we know it we're walking right in
[1:10:54] the vision of God
[1:10:56] God ordaining things God moving things

[1:11:16] need and I can bring him all the way
[1:11:18] over from over here and bring them all
[1:11:20] the way over here and we think well

[1:12:21] we got a god
[1:12:23] [Applause]
[1:12:28] Hallelujah the word is still the
[1:12:31] discerner he said I know there's truly a
[1:12:33] Discerning spirit of God and Gifts of
[1:12:36] knowledge that calls and
[1:12:38] speaks is perfect every
[1:12:40] time and we're earnestly contending for
[1:12:45] that the faith that was once delivered
[1:12:48] to the Saints he said I know there's
[1:12:50] dreams and stomach fulls of fresh meat
[1:12:53] that or something or another that can
[1:12:54] cause you to have nightmares you jump up
[1:12:56] and call it a vision but there's a real
[1:12:59] genuine vision of
[1:13:02] God that's right God promised
[1:13:07] it well that's just for the prophet well
[1:13:09] ain't what the word said word said old
[1:13:12] men shall dream dreams and young men
[1:13:13] shall see
[1:13:17] Visions amen what are you well I tell
[1:13:20] you what that was just brother Brandon
[1:13:21] that's not what the word says sure I
[1:13:24] understand he was a gift to an age I
[1:13:26] understand all of that nobody's trying
[1:13:28] to be brother
[1:13:33] brandom trying to be Jesus
[1:13:39] Christ and if you got a problem with
[1:13:41] that you need to pack up and go to the
[1:13:42] house that's what we're all about to be
[1:13:46] like
[1:13:47] Jesus to be like
[1:13:51] Jesus amen he said see Jesus Christ is a
[1:13:55] same yesterday today and
[1:13:56] forever he does stuff like that and it
[1:13:59] never fails the Bible said if there be
[1:14:00] anyone among you a spiritual or Prophet
[1:14:03] let him speak and what he says if it
[1:14:04] comes to pass then hear him if I for I'm
[1:14:07] with him if don't then don't hear him
[1:14:08] because he's a false prophet God can't
[1:14:10] lie God tells the truth all the
[1:14:14] time hello somebody well you got people
[1:14:17] that they won't even say they had a
[1:14:18] vision they say well I just believe the
[1:14:19] Lord spoke to me and he said do this and
[1:14:21] this and this and they do it and fail
[1:14:22] and they do it and it don't come to pass
[1:14:24] well that wouldn't God speaking that's
[1:14:26] right many people make God the biggest
[1:14:28] liar there is in the world but God
[1:14:30] doesn't
[1:14:32] lie amen God Don't Lie he tells the
[1:14:35] truth all the
[1:14:38] time come on somebody so if he call me
[1:14:41] his
[1:14:44] son it's the truth all the time if he
[1:14:47] call me his daughter it's the truth all
[1:14:50] the time if he called me saved
[1:14:52] Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:14:55] it's the truth all the
[1:14:57] time cuz he cannot lie and he will not
[1:15:00] change his
[1:15:08] mind he said Paul one night all Hope's
[1:15:10] gone devil laughing on every wave
[1:15:13] jumping up and down screaming at him
[1:15:16] every time the lightning struck he could
[1:15:17] see him seeing I sink you little Old
[1:15:21] Ship water log days in days out
[1:15:25] waves tossing about him walking around
[1:15:27] dragging a chain and preaching the
[1:15:30] gospel he says hallelujah he said we
[1:15:32] can't even let somebody talk about us
[1:15:34] unless we had to blow up like a to toad
[1:15:36] frog eating
[1:15:37] bugshot we're always carrying on about
[1:15:41] something Hallelujah anyhow then say
[1:15:44] we're earnestly contending for the faith
[1:15:46] the brandom tabern the brandom
[1:15:48] Tabernacle needs a whole lot to be
[1:15:50] straightened out
[1:15:52] first he said so does a Pentecostal
[1:15:54] Baptist that's the reason we're not
[1:15:56] getting anywhere we're not honest and
[1:15:57] sincere if we ever came face to face
[1:16:00] with that thing there that makes us
[1:16:01] unmovable that's always abounding in God
[1:16:05] that faith that was once delivered to
[1:16:07] the Saints but he said that old
[1:16:08] caterpillar come in that canker worm and
[1:16:10] eat it off days of Miracles will pass
[1:16:12] you don't have to do this you don't have
[1:16:13] to do that if God brought forth his
[1:16:15] first Branch out of that vine was a
[1:16:18] Pentecostal Branch with power Visions
[1:16:22] Revelations healings sanctification
[1:16:25] justification Holy Spirit the next
[1:16:27] Branch will be the same
[1:16:30] thing certainly will every time that
[1:16:33] vine puts forth a branch it'll be
[1:16:35] exactly like the one in the first place
[1:16:38] as I said last night talking with a
[1:16:39] bunch of Brothers you can't have a grape
[1:16:41] vine bear pumpkins you can't get a
[1:16:43] pumpkin to Bear grapes that's true
[1:16:45] whatever life is in that vine will come
[1:16:47] out in that Branch if it's directly into
[1:16:50] that lifeline and he said of Christ is
[1:16:53] that vine and the life of Christ Christ
[1:16:56] is in that person it'll be like
[1:17:03] Jesus it'll be like
[1:17:07] Jesus it'll bear the fruits of him
[1:17:12] now a Vine can be grafted in I've seen
[1:17:16] it done before you can take and you know
[1:17:18] citrus fruit and graft another citrus
[1:17:20] fruit into the side of that tree it'll
[1:17:22] be a say a a grapefruit tree but this
[1:17:25] this this branch that was grafted in was
[1:17:27] oranges it'll always bear forth oranges
[1:17:30] cuz that's the life that's inside of it
[1:17:32] but if that original tree ever puts out
[1:17:35] another
[1:17:37] Chute it's going to Bear the life that's
[1:17:40] in that
[1:17:42] tree sure there's been a lot of people
[1:17:44] grafted into the life and they they they
[1:17:47] feel it they see it they they they enjoy
[1:17:49] it for a moment but their fruits are not
[1:17:51] bearing what that life
[1:17:52] beared but if that that that life ever
[1:17:56] come that that tree ever comes out again
[1:17:58] and puts out a branch and I believe it's
[1:18:01] done it again in our
[1:18:03] day amen so we cannot say we got
[1:18:06] something different if we're still put
[1:18:08] into the same
[1:18:10] Lifeline how can we change it how can we
[1:18:13] do it amen we can't make it something
[1:18:15] different unless we change the life
[1:18:17] that's inside of there because we're
[1:18:20] pulling from the same source that Paul
[1:18:23] pulled for and pet pulled from and all
[1:18:26] the apostles pulled from and there was
[1:18:28] enough life in there they could walk up
[1:18:30] to a man at the gate called beautiful
[1:18:32] and he's begging for arms and begging to
[1:18:34] be given money say Silver and Gold Have
[1:18:36] I None but such as I have give I unto
[1:18:41] thee they couldn't have done that amen
[1:18:43] they couldn't have had that that thought
[1:18:45] and that that word before Pentecost but
[1:18:47] now they knew the source wasn't just
[1:18:49] walking beside them the source was
[1:18:51] inside of them Hallelujah and they
[1:18:55] reached down and they picked that
[1:18:56] crippled man up and his ankle bones came
[1:18:58] back and he went leaping and praising
[1:19:01] and thanking
[1:19:03] God did I remember that right leaping
[1:19:07] and praising and thanking
[1:19:09] God and today we got something different
[1:19:14] now apparently there ain't been enough
[1:19:16] people healed in your
[1:19:18] church apparently there ain't been
[1:19:19] enough healings take place apparently
[1:19:22] ain't been I ain't talking about
[1:19:23] physically crippled I'm talking about
[1:19:25] spiritually
[1:19:27] crippled if a if a physical ailment on a
[1:19:30] man could cause him to leap and pray
[1:19:32] thank and jump around and thank God how
[1:19:35] much more could a spiritual crippled
[1:19:37] you've been crippled with bitterness
[1:19:38] you've been crippled with this crippled
[1:19:40] with that and all of a sudden the Holy
[1:19:42] Spirit Come Over You Through the
[1:19:44] preaching of the word it ought to make
[1:19:45] you want to shout it ought to make you
[1:19:48] want to praise God cuz you have now
[1:19:50] experiened what it's like to be free
[1:19:58] so they had jumping and shouting in the
[1:20:00] original Church original book of
[1:20:03] Acts somehow we're supposed to have
[1:20:05] something different we come a sensible
[1:20:08] way well there ain't nothing more
[1:20:10] sensible than dying out to your rotten
[1:20:15] self I tell you what ain't sensible a 10
[1:20:18] step program to get over
[1:20:21] pornography I tell you what is sensible
[1:20:23] just a moment in his PR
[1:20:27] it'll be all gone from
[1:20:30] you amen that's what's
[1:20:33] sensible I tell you what ain't sensible
[1:20:36] Amen to go after this herb or that herb
[1:20:38] or this doctor that I understand God
[1:20:39] uses all that but don't let that be your
[1:20:43] crutch don't let that be what you lean
[1:20:45] on what's sensible is when the doctor
[1:20:47] says you're not going to live you can
[1:20:49] look to the word and say God says I care
[1:20:52] God says I can be healed God says I I
[1:20:54] can Rise Again God said it I believe
[1:20:57] [Applause]
[1:20:59] it that's
[1:21:04] sensible if you're in the same life you
[1:21:07] can't produce anything
[1:21:09] else so if you're producing anything
[1:21:11] else you're not in the same
[1:21:15] life what's anything else it'll act like
[1:21:18] him it'll talk like him it'll Walk Like
[1:21:21] Him it'll heal like him it'll see
[1:21:23] Visions like him it'll produce
[1:21:25] everything exactly his life produced
[1:21:27] perfectly every time because it's the
[1:21:29] same
[1:21:34] life
[1:21:35] Hallelujah see you're he said he
[1:21:38] describes it like this you're just a
[1:21:39] shell a man is like a water pipe he's
[1:21:42] not the water but he's the
[1:21:44] pipe and you take the water out of him
[1:21:47] he'll just
[1:21:49] rust yeah that's back when they made you
[1:21:52] know Iron pipes and such you know we
[1:21:55] probably don't have many of them most of
[1:21:56] them are
[1:21:59] rusted now we got PVC pipes then they
[1:22:03] get a little problem coming along and
[1:22:04] they
[1:22:05] bust we want to be made out of the right
[1:22:09] material amen amen so he he he he he
[1:22:13] said but he take the water out of him
[1:22:14] he'll rust and that's what's the matter
[1:22:17] today there's two many of us
[1:22:20] rusting that once had an experience
[1:22:27] hello
[1:22:29] somebody wow I've read that about 10
[1:22:32] times today there's too many of us that
[1:22:35] are
[1:22:36] rusting that once had an
[1:22:40] experience but somewhere the lifeline's
[1:22:43] cut
[1:22:46] off once I had an experience he said
[1:22:49] whatever you do keep the water flowing
[1:22:56] keep the lifeline cuz that's what keeps
[1:22:59] the lifeline
[1:23:03] going Hallelujah this is where you say
[1:23:06] in Ephesians Church age he said you're
[1:23:08] forgetting your first
[1:23:12] love you're doing things that you you
[1:23:15] you wouldn't have done before and you
[1:23:17] know you're you're you're picking up
[1:23:18] things and habits that you wasn't used
[1:23:20] to
[1:23:21] do keep the water flowing
[1:23:27] that's why it's important to come to the
[1:23:29] house of God to get in that
[1:23:31] presence I understand you get in the
[1:23:33] presence of God at home in your car I've
[1:23:35] had it happen many times but there's
[1:23:37] something about the word of God when
[1:23:39] it's fulfilled where two or three are
[1:23:40] gathered in my name there I'll
[1:23:43] be there's something about forsake not
[1:23:46] the assembling of yourself together even
[1:23:48] the much more as you see that day
[1:23:50] approaching what day the coming of the
[1:23:53] Lord but how many we find just this is
[1:23:56] taking them out that's taking them out
[1:23:58] that's taking them out before you know
[1:24:00] they'll be left on the other side of
[1:24:02] Jordan in the
[1:24:07] tribulation keep the water
[1:24:10] flowing even even like Tabernacle keep
[1:24:13] it where the spirit of God can
[1:24:16] move don't ever allow things to come in
[1:24:20] and cause you to just sit back and say
[1:24:22] well I'm just here you know I I
[1:24:24] it's just a Wednesday night it's just a
[1:24:26] Sunday it's I got boy I got so many
[1:24:28] troubles I got this this happened today
[1:24:30] I got and before you know you thought
[1:24:32] about everything in the world and the
[1:24:33] service is over and you rusted a little
[1:24:36] bit
[1:24:38] more keep the water
[1:24:43] flowing it's what keeps the lifeline
[1:24:48] going let's stand together I got a lot
