[54:15] to have us back all right that was a
[54:18] long four weeks for me and I'm glad to
[54:20] be home here back amongst the home
[54:23] church we had some tremendous meetings
[54:24] there in Marius and also in Indiana this
[54:27] past week I'll share some of the
[54:29] testimonies toward the end of the
[54:30] service today uh I want to say thank you
[54:33] for your prayers thank you for your
[54:35] support uh as we go out we're in an
[54:37] extension of even night Tabernacle and I
[54:40] can say that uh God really used us not
[54:43] just me but Brother David Mayer in a
[54:45] very special way for the island there
[54:47] for the Believers they hadn't had a camp
[54:49] meeting in 5 years and uh the pastor
[54:53] made a comment he said we have never had
[54:55] a camp meeting quite like this this is
[54:57] by far the best meeting we've had and
[54:59] I'll share some testimonies at the end
[55:01] of what God did there but you know God
[55:04] still does the same
[55:06] today he doesn't just move in one place
[55:08] that he can't move in another place but
[55:11] he's God and he's God all the time and I
[55:13] want to speak to you by the grace of God
[55:14] this morning brother David spoke on this
[55:17] and it just resonated in my heart he
[55:20] spoke when we were there The Winds of
[55:21] Pentecost still blow and I sent him a
[55:24] text I Saidi still in your title because
[55:26] it just resonated so much in my heart
[55:29] and I want to speak to you today on the
[55:30] Winds of Pentecost still blowing we look
[55:33] here in John 14 and verse 16 and we'll
[55:36] also look here in Acts one kind of start
[55:39] building our foundation this
[55:45] morning John 14 and verse 16 it says I
[55:49] will pray the father and he shall give
[55:52] you another
[55:53] comforter that he may abide with you for
[55:56] forever even the spirit of Truth whom
[55:58] the world cannot receive because it
[55:59] seeth him not neither knoweth him but
[56:02] you know him for he dwelleth with you
[56:04] and shall be in you notice the promise
[56:07] in verse 18 I will not leave you
[56:09] comfortless but I will come to you then
[56:11] we look over here in Acts acts 1 and
[56:14] verse one says the former treaties have
[56:17] I made of the aest of all that Jesus
[56:19] began both to do and teach until the day
[56:22] in which he was taken up after that he
[56:25] through the Holy Spirit had given
[56:26] Commandments unto the apostles whom he
[56:28] had chosen to whom he also showed
[56:31] himself alive after his Passion by many
[56:33] infallible proofs being seen of them 40
[56:37] days and speaking of things pertaining
[56:38] to the kingdom of God and being
[56:40] assembled together with them commanded
[56:42] him that they should not depart from
[56:44] Jerusalem but wait for the promise of
[56:46] the Father which saith he you have heard
[56:49] of me verse 5 for John truly baptized
[56:52] with water but you shall be baptized
[56:54] with the Holy Ghost not many days hence
[56:57] and when they were there come together
[56:58] they asked him saying Lord will thou
[57:00] this time restore the Kingdom of Israel
[57:02] and he said unto them it is not for you
[57:04] to know the times or the seasons for
[57:07] which the father had put in his own
[57:08] power but ye shall receive power after
[57:11] that the Holy Spirit has come upon you
[57:13] and you shall be a witness unto me in
[57:15] both Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria and
[57:18] other most parts of the earth God bless
[57:20] you you can have your seats this morning
[57:27] so again we're going to look here just
[57:29] for a little while this morning and uh
[57:31] to still brother Tim's frases we only
[57:32] have one service a day and I'm not sure
[57:35] exactly how far we'll get into it today
[57:37] I have a lot of material but I do want
[57:38] to share a lot of testimonies toward the
[57:40] end so we can see what God has done here
[57:43] at even light Tabernacle we have many
[57:44] powerful testimonies here but they don't
[57:46] just reside here at even light
[57:48] Tabernacle we serve a living God that
[57:50] has done the miraculous around the world
[57:52] and by the grace of God I want to show
[57:54] that and declare that today but we find
[57:56] the Bible says but you shall receive
[57:58] power in verse 8 after the Holy Ghost
[58:00] has come upon you that word there is
[58:02] dunamis and it means power to perform
[58:05] Miracles right so don't ever get in your
[58:08] mind that the days of Miracles is over
[58:10] because here we have a promise of
[58:12] receiving power and that word power is a
[58:15] power to perform Miracles it's an
[58:17] inherent power a power residing In A
[58:20] Thing by the virtue of its nature notice
[58:23] the power is not your human ability the
[58:25] power power is not your human makeup but
[58:28] the power is a supernatural power that
[58:30] is end doing the people from the
[58:32] receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[58:35] otherwise we're receiving the very same
[58:37] power the very same life the very same
[58:41] ability to perform the supernatural that
[58:43] Jesus did that the apostles did you and
[58:46] I do as
[58:47] well and the Bible tells us in Acts 2 it
[58:50] says when the day of Pentecost was fully
[58:52] come they were in one Accord in one
[58:55] place
[58:56] so I want to just kind of take this for
[58:58] a minute and break this down this word
[59:00] Accord there one Accord that means they
[59:01] were all in one mind right now look
[59:05] there's probably over 120 here today and
[59:07] none of us are all in the same
[59:09] mind we have different ideas different
[59:12] opinions different way we receive things
[59:14] different Revelations that maybe
[59:16] somebody else doesn't receive but the
[59:17] Bible says they were in the same mind
[59:20] the same affections the same desires the
[59:22] same wishes they were concentrated on
[59:24] one object every man having the same end
[59:27] in view none of them were uninterested
[59:30] none of them were unconcerned none of
[59:32] them were lukewarm they were in one mind
[59:34] and one Accord so you're telling me
[59:36] there's 120 men and women in the upper
[59:39] room no doubt they had different
[59:42] ideas no doubt they had different
[59:44] opinions no doubt they had they didn't
[59:46] see everything that Jesus preached
[59:48] exactly the
[59:50] same come on but their differences
[59:54] didn't make them any less C
[59:56] their difference didn't make them any
[59:58] less a brother or sister the difference
[1:00:00] didn't make them any less a Believer
[1:00:02] notice they were all in the upper room
[1:00:04] they all had a purpose for coming they
[1:00:07] all were called and they all went so we
[1:00:10] find they were all in one Accord they
[1:00:12] were concentrated on one thing of being
[1:00:14] endued with power from on high they
[1:00:18] otherwise for a little while they put
[1:00:19] their differences aside and they focus
[1:00:22] on one thing and maybe if we can put our
[1:00:24] differences aside this morning maybe the
[1:00:26] things that you've been going through
[1:00:27] maybe this one rubbed you the wrong way
[1:00:29] but put it aside this morning and be
[1:00:32] concentrated on one thing that the days
[1:00:34] of Pentecost are still here that the
[1:00:36] Winds of Pentecost still blow God still
[1:00:39] moves God still heals God still delivers
[1:00:42] God still sets free God still Saves The
[1:00:45] Lost God still does what God
[1:00:48] does so notice it's not about all of our
[1:00:51] differences it's about being
[1:00:53] concentrated on one thing and I believe
[1:00:55] there's an people who's concentrated
[1:00:57] once again on receiving the same power
[1:01:00] the same anointing that they received on
[1:01:02] the day of Pentecost we should be
[1:01:05] expecting to receive it today we should
[1:01:07] expect the Holy Ghost to move in this
[1:01:09] service this
[1:01:11] morning notice they were under
[1:01:13] expectation of receiving the baptism of
[1:01:14] Holy Ghost though their ideas varied
[1:01:17] though their opinions varied though they
[1:01:18] didn't see everything ey to ey and I
[1:01:20] believe as we as Sons and Daughters of
[1:01:22] God we're not going to see eyol on every
[1:01:24] Doctrine we're not going going to see
[1:01:26] eye to eye on everything that brother
[1:01:27] Brandon
[1:01:29] preached you're going to get a different
[1:01:30] Revelation than what I get a revelation
[1:01:32] and maybe they vary a little bit but as
[1:01:34] long as we're concentrated on one thing
[1:01:36] his
[1:01:37] coming come on we're concentrated on his
[1:01:39] coming and I'm not going to sit there
[1:01:41] and worry about my differences with
[1:01:42] brother Aaron though we don't have any
[1:01:44] but if we did I'm not going to sit there
[1:01:45] and worry about that and get all caught
[1:01:47] up on that look our focus is his coming
[1:01:51] and our Focus this morning should be his
[1:01:53] coming into this service moving upon
[1:01:55] hearts and lives and the Winds of
[1:01:58] Pentecost can blow in here this morning
[1:02:00] and set the backslider straight and move
[1:02:02] in in homes and restore marriages and
[1:02:05] heal the broken bodies he's the same God
[1:02:08] today get your minds off your
[1:02:10] differences and get your minds back on
[1:02:12] Jesus Christ the word made
[1:02:16] flesh and the Bible says when the day of
[1:02:19] Pentecost had fully come notice they had
[1:02:21] to wait until the day of Pentecost fully
[1:02:23] came that means up until the 50th day
[1:02:25] they went into the upper room on day 40
[1:02:27] after Jesus departed right and they
[1:02:30] waited and sometimes we got to wait for
[1:02:32] the coming of the Lord it may not be the
[1:02:35] first service it may not be the second
[1:02:36] service but you keep coming you stay
[1:02:38] long enough and the Bible says and then
[1:02:41] suddenly there came a sound from Heaven
[1:02:44] as a Russian Mighty
[1:02:46] Wind and it filled the house where they
[1:02:49] were sitting and there appeared unto
[1:02:50] them clothing tongues like as fire and
[1:02:53] it sat upon each of them and they were
[1:02:55] all
[1:02:56] filled but wouldn't that be glorious
[1:02:58] this morning if we can all just be
[1:03:02] filled we can all just be filled with
[1:03:04] the Holy Ghost and they began to speak
[1:03:07] with other tongues as the spirit gave
[1:03:10] them
[1:03:11] utterance see not this was not just any
[1:03:14] wind that blew in this was not just the
[1:03:17] little breeze that lulled them to sleep
[1:03:19] but the Bible says it was a rushing
[1:03:21] Mighty Wind It suggested force and speed
[1:03:25] and the word wind here is the Breath of
[1:03:27] Life notice what was coming brother
[1:03:30] Aaron into that building the Breath of
[1:03:33] Life came like a force like a a a a uh a
[1:03:37] force of speed and it came and Jesus
[1:03:39] tells us in John 11 and 25 he says I am
[1:03:43] the resurrection I am I am the life and
[1:03:46] he that believeth in me though he were
[1:03:48] dead yet shall he live then we find in
[1:03:51] John 14:6 Jesus said unto them I am the
[1:03:54] way the truth and the life so we find
[1:03:57] that there was a promise given to them
[1:03:59] of receiving the Holy Ghost and then
[1:04:00] when they got there in the day of
[1:04:02] Pentecost fully came the presence of
[1:04:04] almighty God came not like a gentle
[1:04:07] breeze but like a mighty rushing wind
[1:04:09] and it filled the house wonderful the
[1:04:13] Breath of God be to blow in what did The
[1:04:15] Winds of Pentecost blew down on the day
[1:04:18] of Pentecost and the same wind still
[1:04:20] blow today he doesn't stop being God
[1:04:23] just because of our nature and the AG in
[1:04:26] which we're living in he's still God and
[1:04:28] he still moves and he still blows and he
[1:04:31] still fills with the breath of
[1:04:34] life so I will say it like this we have
[1:04:37] today the blessings of Pentecost not the
[1:04:40] organization but the
[1:04:42] experience it's now that Christ reveals
[1:04:45] himself yes sir it's not in another
[1:04:48] generation it's not in another age it's
[1:04:51] now he reveals himself by the word
[1:04:56] not just by the letter but power and
[1:04:58] manifestation of the word the word
[1:05:00] performing signs and wonders doing what
[1:05:01] it says it'll do and I ask you where is
[1:05:04] he at
[1:05:06] today where is the manifestation of his
[1:05:09] word
[1:05:12] today the prophet of God said deity is
[1:05:15] not in heaven it's in
[1:05:18] you don't look for another Camp don't
[1:05:22] look for a favorite preacher don't look
[1:05:23] for a special meeting
[1:05:26] deity is not in heaven it's in you this
[1:05:28] morning sitting right here on the Pew
[1:05:31] he's here amen not just because we can
[1:05:34] quote the scripture that in them where
[1:05:35] the presence of two or three will be
[1:05:37] there I'll be in their M no it's not
[1:05:38] that we have the physical manifestation
[1:05:41] because we've received the promise of
[1:05:43] the Holy Ghost and if we received the
[1:05:45] promise of the Holy Ghost then shouldn't
[1:05:47] signs and wonders follow our Our Lives
[1:05:50] now I'm going to break a base a
[1:05:52] foundation here and brother uh brother
[1:05:54] Josh kind of hit this at the camp last
[1:05:56] week but I will go ahead and tell you
[1:05:58] before I left macius I was already
[1:05:59] studying this thought and had a lot of
[1:06:01] stuff already put together and it was
[1:06:02] just uh just a confirmation that I was
[1:06:05] in the right chain but he said the
[1:06:06] Keystone of the Bible is the Revelation
[1:06:09] that God never
[1:06:11] changes come on let's get with me this
[1:06:13] morning God never changes he said that
[1:06:15] his ways are unchangeable as he is
[1:06:18] Hebrews 13:8 we quote it's a favorite
[1:06:20] scripture to many of us if not all of us
[1:06:22] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:06:26] and
[1:06:27] forever we believe that Ecclesiastes 3
[1:06:30] and ver14 I know that whatsoever God
[1:06:33] doeth it shall be forever that means he
[1:06:35] never changes nothing can be put to it
[1:06:38] brings him down to Revelations 22 nor
[1:06:41] anything taken from it and God doeth it
[1:06:43] and Men shall fear before him that which
[1:06:46] has been is now notice that which has
[1:06:49] been is now God never changes that which
[1:06:53] he has done he will do again today
[1:06:56] that which has been is now and that
[1:06:58] which is to be ha already been and God
[1:07:00] will require it that which is to pass
[1:07:02] and brother B says here it is an
[1:07:04] unchanging God with unchanging ways what
[1:07:08] he did at the first age he will have to
[1:07:10] keep doing until it is done for the last
[1:07:13] time there will never be a
[1:07:17] change come on church he said what God
[1:07:21] did in the first age is what he wants to
[1:07:24] do in all the age
[1:07:26] ages oh my so we find what did God do in
[1:07:30] the first AG he breathed life into the
[1:07:33] church and if he breathe life into the
[1:07:36] first church won't he breathe life again
[1:07:38] into the last church if he Breathe Into
[1:07:40] The Omega and they perform the
[1:07:43] supernatural won't he breathe into or he
[1:07:45] breathe into the alpha and they perform
[1:07:47] the supernatural won't he breathe once
[1:07:49] again into the Omega Church and provide
[1:07:51] her rapturing faith so that she can
[1:07:54] receive her Lord and be caught away in
[1:07:56] his coming oh I'm telling you the same
[1:07:58] Winds of Pentecost still
[1:08:01] blow the notice now no longer were they
[1:08:04] a powerless
[1:08:05] group no longer were they just trying to
[1:08:08] debate what the what the Messiah said or
[1:08:11] what the great teacher said now they
[1:08:13] were endued with power from the almighty
[1:08:16] the life of the Creator the one who
[1:08:19] spoke the worlds into existence was now
[1:08:21] living and dwelling in the lives of 120
[1:08:24] amen
[1:08:27] notice they were empowered to do the
[1:08:30] same things that Jesus
[1:08:33] did come on I'm looking at some jesuses
[1:08:36] out there you've been
[1:08:39] empowered by the word not by just a
[1:08:42] prophet but by the scriptures by the
[1:08:44] word to do the very same thing he
[1:08:48] did notice
[1:08:50] now what he did then he does today yes
[1:08:55] that's right what he was then he is
[1:08:59] today that's right see men change
[1:09:02] churches change societies change but God
[1:09:05] never changes nor does his word change
[1:09:08] for it ever Remains the Same through
[1:09:10] every age through every generation he
[1:09:12] remains constant and his word remain
[1:09:14] constant he's an unchanging God and when
[1:09:17] you look in the Ephesian Church a
[1:09:19] brother B says the word can't change or
[1:09:21] be changed because it's word the word is
[1:09:24] God and we find here in John 1 he says
[1:09:27] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:09:29] was with God and the Word was God and
[1:09:31] the word can't change and then brother
[1:09:33] brand drops down into Revelations 22 he
[1:09:36] says if any man shall add unto the
[1:09:38] things God shall add unto him the
[1:09:40] plagues that are written there in and if
[1:09:43] any man shall take away from the words
[1:09:44] of the book of this prophecy God will
[1:09:46] take away his part out of the book of
[1:09:48] life so God never changes we're not to
[1:09:51] inject our own understanding we're not
[1:09:53] to pull away and say well this one's not
[1:09:55] used today it was only for that
[1:09:57] generation or that age no God's word
[1:10:00] never changes he is the same yesterday
[1:10:03] today and forever yeah and if his word
[1:10:06] is the same then the then the Miracles
[1:10:09] and then the the expectations and the
[1:10:11] signs and wonders must produce the same
[1:10:14] results that it did then and through
[1:10:16] every generation and through every
[1:10:18] Church age it must be the same because
[1:10:20] why it's the same anointing it's the
[1:10:22] same spirit it's the same power let me
[1:10:25] tell you the same Pentecostal winds
[1:10:27] blowing therefore it must produce the
[1:10:29] same signs and wonders now I'm not
[1:10:32] basing this service just on signs and
[1:10:33] wonders but I'm trying to declare to you
[1:10:35] God doesn't change so don't think that
[1:10:38] oh because we're in leoda and we find
[1:10:41] the society closing in around us chaoses
[1:10:44] all around that God stopped being
[1:10:47] God that's right he is very much God
[1:10:50] today still on the throne still
[1:10:53] interceding that's right notice the
[1:10:55] prophet would tell us the L the C and
[1:10:57] age ends when the bride is taken
[1:11:00] up listen what the prophet says now thus
[1:11:03] what the church was at Pentecost is the
[1:11:07] standard you argue with that and say we
[1:11:09] don't need Miracles we don't need signs
[1:11:11] we don't need wonders I'm telling you
[1:11:13] what a prophet said that the Pentecost
[1:11:15] is the standard what God set up in the
[1:11:18] beginning is the standard through every
[1:11:20] age Until the End Time age that's right
[1:11:22] what he was there he is tonight amen
[1:11:26] amen that is the pattern there is no
[1:11:29] other pattern no other he says no matter
[1:11:32] what the scholars say God has not
[1:11:34] changed that pattern what God did at
[1:11:37] Pentecost he has to keep on doing until
[1:11:40] the church ages closed yes sir and we
[1:11:43] find that the church ages close out when
[1:11:45] the bride is taken
[1:11:47] up when the Rapture of the church
[1:11:49] Rapture of the Bride takes place then
[1:11:51] the leot to C and AG closes out then he
[1:11:53] goes back to the Jews
[1:11:56] so but we find many today that want to
[1:11:58] say and declare that the apostolic age
[1:12:00] is
[1:12:02] over may be over for some but it's not
[1:12:04] over for us come on that's got to be
[1:12:07] your conf your confession it may be over
[1:12:08] for some but it's not over for us what
[1:12:11] you say brother Joe what do you mean by
[1:12:13] Apostolic age well I look that up just
[1:12:16] because I like to do a little bit
[1:12:17] thorough because you know what I'm from
[1:12:19] Mississippi we're not all that bright
[1:12:21] but the word Apostolic age or the
[1:12:23] reference there is related in to the
[1:12:25] seccession of Spiritual Authority from
[1:12:28] the apostles otherwise the same
[1:12:30] Authority that he gave the apostles men
[1:12:33] are declaring today that that is over
[1:12:35] that God doesn't do Miracles anymore
[1:12:38] that it was only for the 12 it was only
[1:12:40] for the New Testament that the works of
[1:12:42] the Holy Ghost that he did in the book
[1:12:44] of Acts cease to exist God doesn't move
[1:12:47] that way
[1:12:48] anymore they declare that the apostolic
[1:12:51] age is over well they too late
[1:12:55] come on even like Tabernacle I said
[1:12:57] they're too late we got testimony after
[1:13:00] testimony after testimony right here in
[1:13:01] this building that proves that they're
[1:13:03] too late that God still moves and the
[1:13:05] Winds of Pentecost still blow he is
[1:13:08] still God they claim that the works of
[1:13:10] the Holy Ghost in the apostles in the
[1:13:12] book of Acts no longer exist men today
[1:13:15] claim that the Miracles are
[1:13:18] passed that God doesn't do them anymore
[1:13:21] some claim that now that we have the
[1:13:23] revealed word we no longer need these
[1:13:25] signs and
[1:13:28] wonders notice now we're going to look
[1:13:30] here in Mark
[1:13:32] 16 I got all day so we're just going to
[1:13:34] take our time this morning Mark 16 and
[1:13:38] these signs we're going to just let's go
[1:13:40] to this
[1:14:13] a there we go now now we got some power
[1:14:16] Mark 16 notice now it says these signs
[1:14:19] shall follow them that
[1:14:22] Believe come turn that down just a
[1:14:24] little bit brother Dave you don't mind
[1:14:26] says in my name shall they cast out
[1:14:27] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[1:14:30] they shall take up serpents and they
[1:14:32] shall drink any deadly thing and it
[1:14:34] shall not hurt them they shall lay hands
[1:14:36] on the sick and they shall shall recover
[1:14:42] now notice that's in the New Testament
[1:14:44] that's what Jesus in my Bible that's red
[1:14:47] letter let me say it nowhere do I find
[1:14:50] an expiration date on this scripture
[1:14:54] nowhere does God say it's going to only
[1:14:55] go through six ages and in the seventh
[1:14:58] age that this scripture is not going to
[1:14:59] be in effect but it says these signs
[1:15:02] shall follow the key here is the
[1:15:06] believer notice if you want to say the
[1:15:08] days of Miracles is pass it shows that
[1:15:10] you're not a Believer but for the
[1:15:12] believer this morning the days of
[1:15:14] Miracles are still present God is still
[1:15:16] moving God is still blowing Supernatural
[1:15:19] is still taking place the sick are still
[1:15:22] being healed demons are still being cast
[1:15:24] out because it's no infallible word of
[1:15:28] God and his word never
[1:15:32] changes notice let's go to John 14:11
[1:15:34] believe me that I am in the father and
[1:15:37] the father in me or else believe me for
[1:15:39] the very Works sake notice he's telling
[1:15:42] Jesus Is Telling if you can't believe me
[1:15:44] that's if you can't believe that I am
[1:15:46] who I say I am then believe the
[1:15:49] works cuz some people have a hard time
[1:15:51] believing the
[1:15:53] preacher but he's saying believe the
[1:15:56] works notice verse 12 verily verily I
[1:16:00] say unto you he that believeth the key
[1:16:03] now in both of these scriptures is
[1:16:07] believing he that believeth me in the
[1:16:09] works that I do shall he do also and
[1:16:12] Greater Works than these shall he do
[1:16:14] because I go unto the father and
[1:16:17] whatsoever you shall ask in my name I
[1:16:19] will do it that the father may be
[1:16:21] glorified in the son if you ask anything
[1:16:24] in my name name I will do it so we find
[1:16:28] in John 14:12 Jesus declaring that this
[1:16:31] is going to continue that's right this
[1:16:34] will continue John 14:12 The Works that
[1:16:37] I do shall you do also will continue if
[1:16:40] you continue to believe but if you don't
[1:16:43] want to believe if you want to give up
[1:16:44] and say well I just got to live like
[1:16:46] this I just got to go through these
[1:16:48] trials and you know there's no hope
[1:16:49] there's no way out there's nothing for
[1:16:51] me and you choose not to believe then
[1:16:53] this scripture doesn't app Li Li to you
[1:16:55] but if you will believe this morning and
[1:16:57] take God at his word this morning then
[1:16:59] the same works the same signs the same
[1:17:02] Miracles the same Supernatural the same
[1:17:04] speaking in tongues the same
[1:17:06] interpretations the same outpouring of
[1:17:08] the Holy Ghost the same winds that blew
[1:17:10] on the day of Pentecost will blow right
[1:17:11] through even light Tabernacle this
[1:17:13] morning will'll blow right through your
[1:17:15] screen this morning it'll blow right in
[1:17:17] there it'll bring healing to your body
[1:17:19] it'll bring restoration to your marriage
[1:17:21] let me tell you it'll heal the church
[1:17:23] it'll take care of situations in a
[1:17:25] church because why because the Winds of
[1:17:27] Pentecost still blow we don't put an
[1:17:29] expiration date on the word of
[1:17:32] God this word will continue on until the
[1:17:35] bride is taken
[1:17:36] up and the L and c and age closes out
[1:17:40] but until then let's have a good time in
[1:17:42] the presence of God until that time
[1:17:45] let's receive and let's let the winds
[1:17:47] blow Upon Us blow upon our church blow
[1:17:50] upon our homes blow upon our children
[1:17:52] blow upon our marriages Let The Winds of
[1:17:54] of the Holy Ghost breathe life into us
[1:17:56] this
[1:17:59] morning see men who believed and
[1:18:01] received the Life of Christ actually
[1:18:04] produced the same results that Jesus did
[1:18:06] right so what we find now we're looking
[1:18:09] today on the Winds of Pentecost and we
[1:18:11] find it in the book of Acts we find a
[1:18:14] lot of the
[1:18:16] Supernatural come on and what the church
[1:18:19] was at in the book of Acts is what the
[1:18:21] church should be in leot deia the true
[1:18:24] church
[1:18:25] okay so what we find in the book of Acts
[1:18:28] is John 14:12 and Mark 16:17 and 18 in
[1:18:33] action we find a people that believe we
[1:18:36] find a people that took God at his word
[1:18:38] we find a people that went to the upper
[1:18:40] room got fill with the Holy Spirit and
[1:18:42] now they begin to do exactly what Jesus
[1:18:46] did the same works that he did while he
[1:18:48] was alive in his Earthly Ministry was
[1:18:50] being now manifested in and through the
[1:18:52] lives of those that were filled with the
[1:18:54] Holy Ghost why because he had breathed
[1:18:56] life into them and This Promise of the
[1:18:59] same works that he did the Bible says we
[1:19:02] would do
[1:19:04] also it would continue to the
[1:19:06] consummation and notice I want you to
[1:19:08] know this morning that it didn't end in
[1:19:10] A New Testament it didn't end with the
[1:19:13] apostles it didn't end with prophets it
[1:19:15] didn't end with the church A's
[1:19:16] Messengers it didn't end with brother
[1:19:18] brandham but what God was he is what God
[1:19:23] did he still does that's right come on
[1:19:26] we got to be in one agreement with that
[1:19:27] this morning what he was he is what he
[1:19:30] did he still does he never
[1:19:35] changes brother B want tell us like this
[1:19:38] he promised a little while the world
[1:19:39] seeth me no more but yet you shall see
[1:19:41] me I as a personal pronoun I will be
[1:19:44] with you even in you even to the
[1:19:46] consummation or the age and that word
[1:19:49] now he goes declares he says now that's
[1:19:51] the end of the world so to the end end
[1:19:54] of the world he will be the
[1:19:57] same he will be the same so look Church
[1:20:01] go read through the book of Acts and
[1:20:02] find out what we're to
[1:20:04] be come
[1:20:06] on go read through the book of I just
[1:20:08] started reading through the book of Acts
[1:20:10] again because I want to see what I'm
[1:20:11] entitled to brother here I want to see
[1:20:13] what I'm entitled to I want to see look
[1:20:16] God if this is in there that I can
[1:20:18] receive just that much I'm not asking
[1:20:20] anything outside of that I'm not asking
[1:20:22] for anything more than that but Lord
[1:20:24] just as long as my life if my family if
[1:20:27] my church as my children if we can
[1:20:29] produce exactly what's in that book then
[1:20:31] I'll be Satisfied why because then I'll
[1:20:33] know that the same signs the same
[1:20:35] wonders the same works that you did
[1:20:38] there you're doing today and I'll be
[1:20:40] pleased with that work and I believe he
[1:20:43] will be pleased with that
[1:20:46] work notice he is the same and promised
[1:20:49] that a little while the world seeth me
[1:20:51] no more the cosmos won't see me but you
[1:20:53] shall see me that's the church that's
[1:20:56] the
[1:20:57] believer you're going to see me for I'll
[1:20:59] be with you even in you to the end of
[1:21:02] the world that makes him the same
[1:21:05] yesterday today and
[1:21:07] forever so St John 14:12 he said he that
[1:21:10] believeth on me and the works that I do
[1:21:12] shall he do also so we see the
[1:21:15] scriptures we can't deny those
[1:21:18] scriptures that's right and what the
[1:21:21] church was at Pentecost is the standard
[1:21:25] look it's not up for
[1:21:27] debate it's not up for debate I don't
[1:21:29] care if you're intellectual it's not up
[1:21:31] for debate I don't care if you want you
[1:21:33] don't have the Dynamics in your church
[1:21:35] it's not up for debate what the church
[1:21:38] was at Pentecost is the standard and he
[1:21:41] never changes therefore what he did then
[1:21:44] is what he's going to do
[1:21:46] today let me tell you if you ain't had a
[1:21:48] move of the spirit in 20 years shame on
[1:21:51] you get into the anointing of the Holy
[1:21:52] Ghost and let that same power that moved
[1:21:55] on you 20 years ago move you again today
[1:21:57] because the Winds of Pentecost are still
[1:22:00] blowing he didn't just stop 20 years ago
[1:22:02] for you in a camp meeting when you gave
[1:22:04] your heart to the Lord or you received
[1:22:05] the initial outpouring of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:07] but he is the same today and there's one
[1:22:10] initial feeling but there's many many
[1:22:12] many refilling and it's high time some
[1:22:14] of us getting L for the refilling of the
[1:22:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost and say
[1:22:19] breathe on me this morning Lord breathe
[1:22:21] the power of the supernatural in my life
[1:22:23] this morning don't let me be lukewarm in
[1:22:25] different cold and form but let me be on
[1:22:28] fire for the things of
[1:22:30] God let the same power that came in that
[1:22:33] day in that room let it come upon me
[1:22:35] this morning let me have a personal
[1:22:38] Revival I'm not looking at my neighbor
[1:22:40] my preacher my pastor I'm looking for my
[1:22:42] own Revival this
[1:22:46] morning
[1:22:47] notice brother said he's the same
[1:22:51] yesterday today and forever don't let
[1:22:54] that just be a
[1:22:56] cliche don't let it be a cliche if he is
[1:22:59] the same then expect the
[1:23:02] same come on young people when you go to
[1:23:04] church or you go to a camp meeting what
[1:23:06] he did there I'm going to share some
[1:23:08] testimonies with you at the end of but
[1:23:09] the power of got in a youth
[1:23:12] meeting and what he was in Marius I'm
[1:23:15] here to tell you he's the same today
[1:23:17] what he was at Ohio he is the same today
[1:23:19] what he was at our Easter Camp he is the
[1:23:22] same today
[1:23:25] infallible proofs that he's still alive
[1:23:29] infallible proofs that he's still moving
[1:23:31] in hearts and lives notice now he's the
[1:23:34] same yesterday today and forever only
[1:23:38] the Corporal
[1:23:40] body notice what the prophet says here
[1:23:43] he uses our
[1:23:45] body Oh my he uses our body he's not
[1:23:50] here in his Corporal body but he using
[1:23:52] your body your hands your feet your
[1:23:55] mouth your
[1:23:57] ears come
[1:23:59] on and I'm not SC you that but some of
[1:24:01] you ain't moved in a long
[1:24:03] time come on let them have access to the
[1:24:06] body let them have access to your mind
[1:24:08] let them have access to your hands let
[1:24:10] them have access to your feet let them
[1:24:11] have access to your
[1:24:13] mouth he ain't coming from bobbleheads
[1:24:15] he's coming from worshippers praisers
[1:24:18] those that will lift up his name those
[1:24:19] that would expect his
[1:24:22] coming notice what he says now he's
[1:24:24] Divine we're the branches then the
[1:24:26] spirit would act again just exactly like
[1:24:28] it act when it was in
[1:24:30] him so we can go through the gospels and
[1:24:33] we can see exactly what the scriptures
[1:24:35] or what the spirit did in
[1:24:37] Jesus and he thought it not robbery to
[1:24:40] be equal with God then why should we
[1:24:42] think of robbery to do the same signs
[1:24:44] and same wonders and perform the same
[1:24:46] word oh come on
[1:24:50] now see brother says that's how Jesus
[1:24:52] was known as a messiah and he's the same
[1:24:55] Messiah today as he was then only
[1:24:58] without a Corporal body here on Earth so
[1:25:01] he sent his Spirit back to you your body
[1:25:04] and my body
[1:25:06] woo yeah some of you getting quiet on me
[1:25:10] sent the spirit back to you your
[1:25:14] body I know some of us when we get in i
[1:25:17] w let me just move
[1:25:19] on cuz I was about to condemn myself and
[1:25:22] I'm like we ain't doing that today
[1:25:26] you know how it is you want to bless
[1:25:27] people off the road in front of you so
[1:25:28] we just we're going to leave that alone
[1:25:31] my wife's looking down like yeah you
[1:25:33] better move
[1:25:34] on but notice notice what he says in the
[1:25:38] rising of the sun he being the groom the
[1:25:41] bride has to come
[1:25:44] forth he being the groom the original
[1:25:46] word the bride has to come forth cuz
[1:25:49] it's part of him it can only be the
[1:25:52] manifestation of the fulfilling of of
[1:25:54] all Revelations any others has spoke of
[1:25:56] the Bride it can only manifest if it
[1:25:59] does something different from the groom
[1:26:01] it isn't the bride but notice she is
[1:26:04] flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life
[1:26:08] of his life power of his power she is
[1:26:13] him so the very same life that lived in
[1:26:17] the groom was manifesting and should
[1:26:19] manifest through
[1:26:22] her if we have received
[1:26:25] if we had the revealed word which I
[1:26:26] believe we do how many of you believe we
[1:26:28] have the real word the Vindicated word
[1:26:29] the restored word then we should also
[1:26:32] have the same evidence we should also
[1:26:36] produce the same
[1:26:38] works that original word produce there
[1:26:41] will be a people notice there will be a
[1:26:43] people whom signs and wonders will work
[1:26:46] through it will follow their lives it
[1:26:49] will vindicate that they really are in
[1:26:51] fact True
[1:26:52] Believers because the Bible says these
[1:26:55] signs shall not maybe not if but shall
[1:26:59] follow the believer notice therefore the
[1:27:02] apostolic age isn't
[1:27:04] over it's only over for those that
[1:27:07] refuse The Works of the spirit it's only
[1:27:09] over for those that refuse to
[1:27:12] believe but for me and my house we're
[1:27:15] going to believe sir for us in the
[1:27:17] church we're going to believe for the
[1:27:19] ministry here even like in the church
[1:27:21] we're going to believe that the same
[1:27:22] signs and same wonders same God God
[1:27:24] still does it brother man says as a man
[1:27:26] and a woman are one the woman taken from
[1:27:28] Messi she had she had taken a spirit the
[1:27:31] femin spirit from him the flesh from his
[1:27:34] side made both mechanics and Dynamics
[1:27:37] the spirit of
[1:27:38] him and the Flesh of him and put it
[1:27:41] together and made mechanics and Dynamics
[1:27:45] until the church becomes both Dynamics
[1:27:47] and mechanics the spirit of God that
[1:27:49] moved him do the same things that he did
[1:27:51] if it hit on 16 cylinders so the bride
[1:27:54] amen for he said John 14:12 he that
[1:27:57] believeth on me and the works that I do
[1:28:00] shall he do also and I will notice here
[1:28:03] listen to this and I will give him a
[1:28:04] charge of my Dynamics in his mechanics
[1:28:08] that the world will not be able to
[1:28:09] withstand it and I will raise him up
[1:28:12] again in the last day and that's what
[1:28:13] we're looking for is a charge of the
[1:28:16] Dynamics to charge your mechanics this
[1:28:19] morning yeah you're a Believer yeah you
[1:28:21] read the scripture yes you believe God
[1:28:23] sent a prophet yes you believe the end
[1:28:25] time message but God send the Dynamics
[1:28:28] Down Let The Winds of Pentecost blow and
[1:28:30] charge that word and make that word live
[1:28:33] out through human
[1:28:36] lives so Scholars may tell you the
[1:28:39] apostolic ages over and I'm coming from
[1:28:41] the Ephesian Church age he says such a
[1:28:43] statement is wrong on two accounts first
[1:28:45] of all it is wrong to suppose that there
[1:28:48] AR any more
[1:28:50] Apostles I'm not saying men calling
[1:28:53] themselves apostles I'm talking about
[1:28:54] God anointing Apostles and sending them
[1:28:56] out just because the original 12 are
[1:28:58] dead and Apostle means one sent and
[1:29:01] there are many sent ones today but they
[1:29:03] are called missionaries he says as long
[1:29:05] as men are being called and sent forth
[1:29:07] with the word of Life there is an
[1:29:10] Apostolic age going
[1:29:12] on now part two of that he says they
[1:29:15] refer to an age of manifested holy ghost
[1:29:18] power is being over since the Bible has
[1:29:20] been completed he said that's untrue he
[1:29:23] says there is not even one scripture
[1:29:25] that suggests that but by many
[1:29:27] conclusively state otherwise here's our
[1:29:30] proof that both of these charges are
[1:29:31] false let's go to Acts 2 and verse
[1:29:34] 38 and we're very familiar with this
[1:29:36] scripture Peter said unto them repent
[1:29:38] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:29:40] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:29:43] of your sins and you shall receive the
[1:29:45] gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise
[1:29:48] notice now for the promise is unto you
[1:29:51] to your children to them that are far
[1:29:53] off even even as many as the Lord Our
[1:29:55] God shall call and the prophet will say
[1:29:57] the promise of the power with which the
[1:29:59] apostles were endued in Pentecost is to
[1:30:01] you the Jews and to the children the
[1:30:04] Jews and to all that are far off the
[1:30:06] Gentiles as to many as the Lord God
[1:30:08] should call both Jew and Gentiles until
[1:30:11] he stops calling the Pentecostal message
[1:30:14] and the power will not cease that's
[1:30:17] right I said until he stops calling I
[1:30:20] didn't say when men stops calling but
[1:30:22] I'm saying when God stops calling then
[1:30:25] the Pentecostal age and his power will
[1:30:27] cease but God is still calling God is
[1:30:30] still moving and the Winds of Pentecost
[1:30:32] are still blowing in
[1:30:35] lives therefore on the basis of Acts 2
[1:30:37] and verse 38 I declare to you that the
[1:30:39] Winds of Pentecost are still
[1:30:42] blowing men and women are still being
[1:30:44] filled with the Holy
[1:30:47] Ghost come on young people are still
[1:30:49] being endued with
[1:30:51] power they come into the meeting one way
[1:30:53] and they lead all together different
[1:30:56] hearts and lives are still being changed
[1:30:57] Supernatural Miracles are still being
[1:31:00] performed see the Life of Christ returns
[1:31:03] in the form of the Holy Ghost not a nail
[1:31:05] scar but the Corporal body is sitting on
[1:31:07] the right hand of God to make
[1:31:08] intercession but the Holy Ghost has come
[1:31:11] to carry on his
[1:31:14] works the Holy Ghost now how many of you
[1:31:16] got the Holy Ghost this
[1:31:18] morning then we should be seeing
[1:31:21] Works cuz the Holy Ghost comes to carry
[1:31:24] on his
[1:31:26] Works Mark 16 in action John 14:12 in
[1:31:31] action there's no way to get away from
[1:31:35] it notice Malachi 3 and verse
[1:31:39] 6 Malachi 3 and: 6 for I am the Lord I
[1:31:43] change
[1:31:44] not so we're declaring again once again
[1:31:47] he's God he never changes I am the Lord
[1:31:51] Brother man says now in the message of
[1:31:52] trial how can you people say that the
[1:31:55] apostolic age cease where do you get
[1:31:58] it how can a Vine come out and bear
[1:32:01] today can go out and bear an orange and
[1:32:04] this bear pumpkin he said it it would
[1:32:06] have to change its life and Malachi the
[1:32:09] third chapter God said I am God I change
[1:32:12] not what he was then he is today he
[1:32:16] always was and always will
[1:32:20] be there it is for all the naysayers for
[1:32:24] all the intellectual Giants that want to
[1:32:25] say that that the movement of the Holy
[1:32:27] Ghost is over it's done with we don't
[1:32:29] have it anymore since a Propet went off
[1:32:31] the scene that's a word that's a seed of
[1:32:35] discrepancy cuz we got Bible proof that
[1:32:37] the word continues to S nowhere did he
[1:32:40] put an explanation or an expiration date
[1:32:42] to it then we find in the message the
[1:32:44] Ephesian Church age he said what the
[1:32:46] church had at Pentecost is her
[1:32:49] inalienable right that means incapable
[1:32:53] of being alien iated surrendered or
[1:32:55] transferred what we received on the day
[1:32:57] of Pentecost is a right that can't be
[1:33:00] surrendered we're not giving it up it
[1:33:02] can't be alienated we're not going to
[1:33:03] abandon it what he was on the day of
[1:33:05] Pentecost he is again today and what the
[1:33:08] church was then we are today Church
[1:33:10] we're not giving it up we're not backing
[1:33:12] down we're not surrendering we're not
[1:33:14] bowing to the the society in which we're
[1:33:16] living in it may be woke up and it may
[1:33:19] be indifferent but there is a people in
[1:33:21] the end time that will stay true to the
[1:33:23] word of God because they're not doing it
[1:33:25] of their own selves they're not doing it
[1:33:27] of some man's Spirit but they're doing
[1:33:28] it because they received the same holy
[1:33:31] spirit that blew in on the day of
[1:33:33] Pentecost it's still blowing today it's
[1:33:35] still moving
[1:33:37] today originally she had the pure word
[1:33:40] of God she had the power of the spirit
[1:33:42] manifested in diverse signs and wonders
[1:33:45] and Gifts of the Holy Ghost that's what
[1:33:47] the church had
[1:33:48] originally so why do we not want that in
[1:33:51] our midst
[1:33:54] you saywell brother Joe Wicked and
[1:33:56] adulterous in generation seeketh after a
[1:33:58] son I'm not seeking it but I'm expecting
[1:34:00] to follow me that's right I'm expected
[1:34:03] because I believe the same word I
[1:34:05] received the same spirit and if I been
[1:34:08] believe the same word in the same works
[1:34:10] and I've received the same Spirit I'm
[1:34:12] not seeking the signs but I'm looking
[1:34:14] back wondering yes there they are yes
[1:34:16] that's evidence yes that's a Vindication
[1:34:18] that I am in fact a True Believer and if
[1:34:21] signs and wonders are not following your
[1:34:22] life then it may be that you don't
[1:34:24] really believe what you think you
[1:34:26] believe but when you believe church I
[1:34:29] say when you believe there ain't no
[1:34:31] devil in hell can stand before you ain't
[1:34:33] no demon of Torment can stand before you
[1:34:35] if you can believe all things are
[1:34:37] possible to them that'll
[1:34:40] believe nothing is impossible with you
[1:34:42] if you can believe the pro why would the
[1:34:45] Prophet come out with only Bel because
[1:34:46] that was a theme song and it's the theme
[1:34:48] of our message believe the word believe
[1:34:51] the signs believe the Wonders believe
[1:34:53] the supernatural believe the
[1:34:56] Miracles believe that he's the
[1:35:01] same Hebrews 2 and verse1 says
[1:35:04] therefore therefore we ought to give a
[1:35:06] more Earnest heed to the things which we
[1:35:09] have heard lest at any time we shall let
[1:35:12] them slip verse four God also bearing
[1:35:15] them witness both with signs and wonders
[1:35:17] and with diverse Miracles and Gifts of
[1:35:20] the Holy Ghost according to his own will
[1:35:24] I'm trying to stack it to you I'm trying
[1:35:27] to show you don't you back off the
[1:35:28] promises of
[1:35:30] God if he bear them witness with signs
[1:35:33] and wonders Miracles and Gifts of the
[1:35:34] Holy Ghost and he's the
[1:35:36] same then shouldn't we expect the same
[1:35:39] signs and wonders and miracles and Gifts
[1:35:41] of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:43] today if he's the same and he cannot
[1:35:46] change I say God here am I let the Winds
[1:35:49] of Pentecost blow on me Let it Blow on
[1:35:52] my church Let it Blow on my family Let
[1:35:54] it Blow on our young matter of fact Let
[1:35:56] It Blow some of these old people that
[1:35:58] got so starching indifferent Let It Blow
[1:36:00] today God let it move us and may we
[1:36:02] Frolic in the wheels of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:04] may we not get starchy cold and formal
[1:36:06] but God may we loosen up and rejoice in
[1:36:09] the Supernatural and rejoice in the
[1:36:11] presence of almighty God may we receive
[1:36:14] the blessings of Pentecost it's a
[1:36:16] promise given to you church it's not a
[1:36:19] by word that's why Jude said I I
[1:36:22] continue to to I contend for the
[1:36:24] original fith that was once
[1:36:26] delivered Jude was contending for that
[1:36:29] same
[1:36:31] experience and if jeude contended for it
[1:36:34] shouldn't we contend for
[1:36:35] it the word contend means to struggle
[1:36:38] for it in defense of he was standing in
[1:36:42] defense of the supernatural he wanted to
[1:36:44] see the same
[1:36:47] display listen what brother Bram says
[1:36:49] here he said the original church was not
[1:36:52] organized by men it was led by the Holy
[1:36:56] Ghost it wasn't very big it was hated it
[1:36:59] was despised it was oppressed it was
[1:37:01] persecuted unto death but it was true to
[1:37:04] God it stayed with the original word
[1:37:06] pattern and the church today the
[1:37:09] believer today is going to stay with the
[1:37:11] original word
[1:37:15] pattern what is the word brother Joe not
[1:37:18] just a preaching of the word not just a
[1:37:20] letter cuz the letter kill it but the
[1:37:22] spirit gives life it's manifestation of
[1:37:26] the word declaring that that word is
[1:37:29] really
[1:37:31] living notice brother say brother Bram
[1:37:34] says now now don't get LED astray here
[1:37:36] when I said that God and his ways never
[1:37:38] changeed I did not say that the church
[1:37:41] and its Messengers could not change the
[1:37:43] church isn't God so she can change but
[1:37:46] what I said was that because of the
[1:37:48] unchanging God with unchanging ways we
[1:37:51] can go back to the beginning and see the
[1:37:54] first and perfect ACT of God and then
[1:37:57] judge by that
[1:38:00] standard that is how it's done the true
[1:38:02] church will
[1:38:04] always all right good you said it I
[1:38:06] didn't have to ask you always try to be
[1:38:09] like the original at
[1:38:11] Pentecost so the true church will always
[1:38:15] try to be like the original at Pentecost
[1:38:17] the true church of today will try to
[1:38:20] approximate the that early first
[1:38:26] one hey I got a news flash for you they
[1:38:29] staggered like a bunch of drunk men and
[1:38:32] women oh so what are we going to do
[1:38:35] today well that ain't my nature brother
[1:38:38] Joe I just don't like all that kind of
[1:38:40] preaching I'm not asking about your
[1:38:42] nature I'm not worried about how you
[1:38:44] feel about it I'm talking about getting
[1:38:46] filled with the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:38:48] cuz brother B said now when you get the
[1:38:50] Holy Ghost you'll act in ways you didn't
[1:38:51] think you would act you would do things
[1:38:54] you didn't think you would do let me
[1:38:55] tell you when I used to go to the bar
[1:38:57] and I got drunk I did some stupid
[1:39:00] stuff and in a clear mind and a sober
[1:39:03] mind I would have never done so what am
[1:39:05] I telling you this morning if you can
[1:39:07] just get South drunk on the presence of
[1:39:09] almighty God you may act in a way this
[1:39:11] morning you never thought you would act
[1:39:13] you may stumble around you may run in
[1:39:16] the spirit you may get up and shout and
[1:39:18] speak in another tongue but let me tell
[1:39:19] you don't worry about how you're going
[1:39:20] to act just start drinking from the
[1:39:22] power of God and let the fountain open
[1:39:25] from the House of David begin to flow
[1:39:27] down and keep drinking and push out and
[1:39:29] drink and push out and drinking push out
[1:39:32] until you're so South struck on the
[1:39:33] power of the Holy Ghost you ain't
[1:39:35] worried about it we're going to carry
[1:39:36] you out of this church don't be ashamed
[1:39:39] of the power of God for what the church
[1:39:42] was then she is
[1:39:44] today and the end time church will try
[1:39:47] to approximate what that first church
[1:39:50] was but I would declare to you it's more
[1:39:52] than just getting drunk on the spirit
[1:39:55] it's more than just speaking in tongues
[1:39:57] it's more than stumbling out of an upper
[1:39:59] room they lived the life behind
[1:40:03] it they liveed the life and signs and
[1:40:07] wonders followed him all through the New
[1:40:11] Testament we're going to get
[1:40:14] there he said now as like be gets like
[1:40:18] the true church will always be the one
[1:40:21] that tries to follow in the steps of her
[1:40:24] Founders at Pentecost and her Messengers
[1:40:27] will all will follow the Apostle Paul
[1:40:29] the first message to the first church
[1:40:31] age it is that simple and that wonderful
[1:40:35] wow it's that
[1:40:38] simple so notice in the beginning when
[1:40:41] God swed his seed upon the Earth he gave
[1:40:44] it in the hearts of his children his
[1:40:46] family to keep that
[1:40:48] word that was their daily defense keep
[1:40:51] the word and here comes the enemy in and
[1:40:53] he broke their barriers by sewing seeds
[1:40:54] of discrepancy contrary to the word of
[1:40:57] God if that was discrepancy in the
[1:40:59] beginning it still is
[1:41:01] today anything that'll add anything to
[1:41:04] the word of God is still a seed of the
[1:41:06] script I don't care where it come from
[1:41:08] if was from an organization if it's from
[1:41:10] a military Source if it's from political
[1:41:12] Powers anything that's contrary to the
[1:41:15] word of God is a seed of discrepancy and
[1:41:18] brother says when man stands and says
[1:41:20] he's the gospel preacher and says that
[1:41:22] the days of Miracles is passed that's a
[1:41:25] seed of
[1:41:27] discrepancy when he says the Miracles
[1:41:29] and the apostolic agees passed he said
[1:41:31] that's a seed of discrepancy when he
[1:41:33] says there's no such thing as Divine
[1:41:35] Healing that's a seed of
[1:41:38] discrepancy when he says well you can be
[1:41:40] baptized in the name of the father and
[1:41:42] the Son and the Holy Ghost that's a seed
[1:41:44] of the Scrapy it wasn't so from the
[1:41:47] beginning he says it's okay for you
[1:41:49] women to put on pants that's the seed of
[1:41:51] the Scrapy it wasn't so from the
[1:41:54] beginning because it says that women
[1:41:55] shall not wear clothes pertaining to a
[1:41:57] man and let me say this it ain't right
[1:41:59] for you men to go around wearing shorts
[1:42:02] either cuz it wasn't so from the
[1:42:04] beginning it's a seed of discrepancy it
[1:42:07] shows you've not received the seed of
[1:42:14] Christ going around we go to these camps
[1:42:16] now we got boys they got bracelets up to
[1:42:19] their arm about like this come on what
[1:42:21] are we doing are we raising a house full
[1:42:24] of women are we raising
[1:42:26] men are we raising our women to be Godly
[1:42:29] sisters are we raising our boys to be
[1:42:31] Godly men or we just going with the
[1:42:34] generation but a people that's receed
[1:42:36] the power of the word they received the
[1:42:39] same anointing and The Same Spirit
[1:42:41] they'll get back to what it was on the
[1:42:43] day of Pentecost men will be men women
[1:42:45] will be
[1:42:47] women come on
[1:42:49] now
[1:42:51] notice he said we can have only one type
[1:42:55] of branch and that's a Pentecostal
[1:42:56] branch in the church with Pentecostal
[1:42:59] experiences woo some of us got to dial
[1:43:02] to our old Methodist belief that old
[1:43:05] Methodist Branch Baptist Branch
[1:43:07] Pentecostal Branch Apostolic Branch then
[1:43:10] we got to have white
[1:43:11] shirts up to our neck can't show no skin
[1:43:16] come on where are we bringing that stuff
[1:43:17] into the message
[1:43:19] for no stay with the word God sent us a
[1:43:22] Vindicated message message line up to it
[1:43:25] I'm going to tell you I don't think they
[1:43:26] had white shirts back in that
[1:43:30] day and let me tell you not all of them
[1:43:33] listen to uh southern gospel music just
[1:43:35] for some of y'all music Fanatics out
[1:43:37] there that think we can't listen to
[1:43:38] anything else but southern gospel shame
[1:43:39] on you I just came from an island in the
[1:43:42] middle of the Indian Ocean they didn't
[1:43:44] play southern gospel you mention
[1:43:47] southern gospel what are you talking
[1:43:49] about they had their own style of
[1:43:50] worship their own style of music but but
[1:43:53] I can tell you one thing it brought down
[1:43:55] the power of the Holy Ghost every
[1:43:57] service so it ain't based on your
[1:43:59] man-made idea what you think the service
[1:44:02] should be how it should go it's based on
[1:44:04] what God has ordained and he's ordained
[1:44:07] the holy ghost in the power of His
[1:44:09] Spirit to come and move on the ministry
[1:44:11] to move into the church to ordain the
[1:44:14] church to flow with the Winds of
[1:44:16] Pentecost and he's the same today as he
[1:44:18] ever
[1:44:19] was he don't need you to stop him and
[1:44:22] and start trying to be God and identify
[1:44:25] what is right and what is
[1:44:27] wrong God does that he knows how to run
[1:44:29] his church let me go on a little bit
[1:44:31] further is this okay this
[1:44:34] morning notice we cannot find him in our
[1:44:38] Creeds we cannot find them in our
[1:44:41] denominations we got to find them back
[1:44:43] where we left them you say well I have
[1:44:47] brother bandam I tell you what I've done
[1:44:48] I've danced in the spirit a lot of us
[1:44:50] want to cling to that especially us
[1:44:52] young people you know we cling oh I had
[1:44:54] a moveing of the Holy Ghost I danced in
[1:44:55] the spirit he goes you know I got it he
[1:44:58] said it wasn't so from the beginning I
[1:45:00] spoke in tongue so I know I got it it
[1:45:02] wasn't so from the beginning that's
[1:45:04] right you say I shouted I got it it
[1:45:07] wasn't so from the beginning he said to
[1:45:09] know Christ is to know the person of
[1:45:11] Christ in the forgiveness of sin and it
[1:45:14] changes your
[1:45:19] life brother B says I've seen people
[1:45:21] dance Shout speak in tongues and so
[1:45:24] forth and live any kind of life so that
[1:45:28] he says so that couldn't be right I've
[1:45:29] seen them join churches shake hands
[1:45:32] baptized go through all kind of Creeds
[1:45:34] and still live like the
[1:45:37] devil it wasn't so at the beginning to
[1:45:40] meet him the person the Lord Jesus is to
[1:45:43] know him as your savior to know him as
[1:45:46] your lover to know him in life but these
[1:45:48] other Creeds and things never at the
[1:45:50] beginning was ever a witness by our Lord
[1:45:54] then he tells them go into all the world
[1:45:55] and preach the gospel to Every Creature
[1:45:58] how far all the world I thought Marisha
[1:46:01] was pretty close to the end of it it
[1:46:04] took us 30 hours to get
[1:46:05] there but we had a great time to every
[1:46:08] creature and these signs shall
[1:46:13] follow them that believe he said that's
[1:46:16] what it was at the beginning and
[1:46:18] anything contrary to that is not right
[1:46:21] you don't find it in Creed you find it
[1:46:24] in Christ he's the only one in my name
[1:46:27] you shall cast out devils and speak with
[1:46:30] new
[1:46:32] tongues and if they take up serpents
[1:46:34] look by all means don't bring any of
[1:46:36] them in here
[1:46:38] please leave your serpents at home if
[1:46:40] you want to handle them that's all fine
[1:46:42] but notice take up serpents or drink
[1:46:44] deadly things it shall not harm them if
[1:46:48] they lay hands on the sick they shall
[1:46:51] recover that that's what the scripture
[1:46:54] said and anything contrary to that is a
[1:46:57] seed of
[1:46:59] discrepancy is that all right so he said
[1:47:02] it takes a personal experience of
[1:47:05] passing from Death unto life and
[1:47:07] becoming a new creature in Christ Jesus
[1:47:10] with Christ in your heart that's the
[1:47:13] Holy Spirit that's where it began but we
[1:47:16] got to get back where we left them
[1:47:19] Church well you say brother Joe we we
[1:47:21] belong to even like Tabernacle brother
[1:47:23] is our pastor he's been laboring behind
[1:47:24] this pull pit for many many many years
[1:47:26] we're good to go but each of us have to
[1:47:28] get back to a
[1:47:30] Pentecost you can't rest on brother
[1:47:32] Aaron he's got a great ministry you
[1:47:33] can't rest on brother Timothy he's got a
[1:47:35] great ministry you can't rest on brother
[1:47:36] Tim even though he's got a great
[1:47:38] ministry a legacy around the world you
[1:47:40] have to have your own
[1:47:43] Pentecost whether you're young whether
[1:47:45] you're old whether you're
[1:47:47] whether you're crazy it doesn't matter
[1:47:49] you must have the same initial
[1:47:51] outpouring that they received on that
[1:47:53] day you got to have it today are you are
[1:47:55] not going
[1:47:57] up understand me you are not going up
[1:48:01] and you don't want to be left here for
[1:48:03] what's about to
[1:48:05] happen brother B tells us now from the
[1:48:08] beginning it wasn't so he says when we
[1:48:10] see men has corrupted the world with
[1:48:12] their traditions and that's the problem
[1:48:13] a lot of it you know message preachers
[1:48:16] now have adopted Dr doson and all this
[1:48:18] psychology and all this intellectual
[1:48:19] stuff and they be they begin to corrupt
[1:48:23] the word of God with their
[1:48:26] Traditions look we don't need Dr doson
[1:48:29] God bless his heart maybe you know you
[1:48:30] can take some good things from there but
[1:48:32] we don't need him to tell us how to
[1:48:34] raise our
[1:48:36] children come on how many you got kids
[1:48:39] that's got the Holy Ghost parents don't
[1:48:42] be afraid to raise your hand they ain't
[1:48:43] that bad I hope I got four kids you know
[1:48:46] what I got great kids Dr doson didn't
[1:48:50] help me and my wife raise our kids
[1:48:53] and nor should he help you and but we've
[1:48:55] gone to Dr dson we've gone to Dave
[1:48:57] Ramsey and look there's some good things
[1:48:59] in Dave Ramsey but Dave Ramsey ain't
[1:49:01] gonna pay your house
[1:49:02] off but you get the Holy Ghost and you
[1:49:05] go operate by the stewardship of the
[1:49:07] Bible and the Bible principles you'll
[1:49:09] take care of the things and one day
[1:49:10] you'll reach that you won't be head over
[1:49:13] your heels in debt you'll live according
[1:49:14] to your means you don't need Dave Ramsey
[1:49:18] you don't need Dr doson we need the holy
[1:49:21] ghost in the church we need need the
[1:49:23] holy ghost in the family we need the
[1:49:25] holy ghost in the soul and then we can
[1:49:27] orchestrate
[1:49:30] correctly notice brother says let's go
[1:49:33] back to the beginning then if we can do
[1:49:37] that then you'll find Christ moving into
[1:49:39] that house that's built upon a solar
[1:49:41] right then these signs and wonders and
[1:49:43] every blessing that God promised will be
[1:49:45] manifested through the
[1:49:47] church Psalms 147 and verse 18
[1:49:56] Psalms 147 Verse 18 it says he sendeth
[1:49:59] out his word and melted them he causes
[1:50:04] his wind that word there is his breath
[1:50:07] to blow he causes his wind to blow and
[1:50:11] the waters to flow so and then we find
[1:50:13] in John 3 Jesus answered and said unto
[1:50:16] him speaking of Nicodemus verily verily
[1:50:19] I say unto you except a man be born
[1:50:21] again he cannot not see the kingdom of
[1:50:25] God then we jump down and we look at
[1:50:27] verse five Jesus answered verily verily
[1:50:29] I say unto unto thee except a man be
[1:50:31] born of water and of spirit he cannot
[1:50:34] enter the kingdom of God that which is
[1:50:36] born of the flesh is flesh but that
[1:50:38] which is born of the spirit is Spirit 1
[1:50:40] Corinthians 12 and verse2 we find for as
[1:50:42] the body is one and has many members and
[1:50:46] all the members of that body being many
[1:50:48] are one body so also is Christ for by
[1:50:51] one Spirit are are we baptized into the
[1:50:55] body so we must be born again how do we
[1:50:58] Born Again by receiving the baptism of
[1:51:00] the Holy Ghost are we baptized into that
[1:51:02] one body and brother B says you cannot
[1:51:05] join the Church of the Living God you're
[1:51:07] born into it by the baptism of the Holy
[1:51:10] Ghost when you're baptized with the Holy
[1:51:12] Ghost these virtues are sealed in it
[1:51:14] goes and the Holy Ghost and therefore he
[1:51:16] that's born of God does not commit sin
[1:51:18] because the seed of God remains in him
[1:51:22] see you can join even like
[1:51:26] Tabernacle some of you moved in you join
[1:51:28] the
[1:51:29] church some of you grew up in the church
[1:51:32] some of you cut your teeth on the pews
[1:51:34] of Evite Tabernacle but you cannot join
[1:51:37] the Church of the Living God you can
[1:51:40] move pack up and come here and leave
[1:51:42] here and go to another church and join
[1:51:44] in but you'll never join the Church of
[1:51:47] the Living God we must be born into the
[1:51:50] church how are you born into it by the
[1:51:53] baptism of the Holy
[1:51:56] Ghost and it ain't about dancing it
[1:51:59] ain't about speaking in tongu and ain't
[1:52:01] about all those things but he said when
[1:52:02] you get the Holy Ghost don't worry
[1:52:04] people will know you got
[1:52:06] it they will know your life will tell
[1:52:09] the story whether you got it or not
[1:52:12] notice brother B tells in Blasphemous
[1:52:14] names he say now the church is the
[1:52:16] mystical Body of Christ born of the
[1:52:18] Breath of God woo did you get it I like
[1:52:21] how he says that
[1:52:23] congregation says amen the Church of God
[1:52:26] is born of the Breath of God God
[1:52:29] breathed breath into its nostril
[1:52:31] spiritually of Adam and he became a
[1:52:33] living Soul did you know that the
[1:52:34] Pentecostals that the true Pentecostal
[1:52:37] church is born of the breath of
[1:52:40] god notice he breathed the Pentecostal
[1:52:44] winds blew in there and it breathe on
[1:52:47] the church breathe life into them he
[1:52:50] said the church the church is born of
[1:52:52] the Breath of God when this stature has
[1:52:54] molded itself up they're in a condition
[1:52:57] God's breath Breeze upon them receive
[1:52:59] the Holy Ghost then you are sons of God
[1:53:02] then he says you can join anything you
[1:53:04] want but you're born into the Church of
[1:53:06] the Living God born by the Breath of God
[1:53:08] God breathe upon them they said receive
[1:53:11] you woo he said the Holy Ghost and and
[1:53:13] and there you are he says now he says
[1:53:15] now not come join put your name on here
[1:53:17] and help us with soup suppers and all
[1:53:19] that join the laws join the Methodist
[1:53:21] laws or B Lodge or a presbyterian Lodge
[1:53:24] or a Catholic Lodge or a Pentecostal
[1:53:26] Lodge and let's just go ahead and put it
[1:53:28] even a mess l or message LOD but when
[1:53:30] you become a child of God you are born
[1:53:33] by the Breath of God Amen he said better
[1:53:36] leave that alone right there and some me
[1:53:38] tell you Church of the Living God if
[1:53:39] you're ever going to be born of the
[1:53:41] spirit of God then you got to let the
[1:53:43] same winds that blew on the day of
[1:53:45] Pentecost blow into your heart and
[1:53:47] breathe life into your life well you're
[1:53:49] no longer the same your desires are no
[1:53:51] longer the same you you no longer want
[1:53:53] to commit sin you no longer want to do
[1:53:55] the things that you used to do but now
[1:53:57] life was blown into you and you become a
[1:53:59] son and daughter of
[1:54:02] God God's life is also in you
[1:54:05] then though you can't believe me Jesus
[1:54:08] said believe the
[1:54:10] works that's how you'll know believe the
[1:54:15] works is I'm the vine you are the
[1:54:18] branches come on don't go to sleep on me
[1:54:20] this morning I'm the vine you are the
[1:54:22] branches he went to Brother sher's house
[1:54:25] and he sat there and he saw a citrus
[1:54:27] tree it was a believe it was a an orange
[1:54:29] tree and it had lemon tangelos
[1:54:31] tangerines grapefruit all on it he says
[1:54:33] how in the world did all these other
[1:54:35] fruit get on that tree he said they were
[1:54:38] grafted in he said so when we pluck this
[1:54:41] Tangerine or we pluck this grapefruit
[1:54:43] from this tree when it puts out another
[1:54:44] fruit will it be an orange he said no it
[1:54:46] will bear the same life that's in the
[1:54:49] branch and so if we don't have the same
[1:54:52] original Pentecostal Branch inside of us
[1:54:55] oh all we will produce is a Methodist
[1:54:58] all we'll produce is a message believer
[1:55:00] but what am I telling you about if that
[1:55:02] Branch if that tree ever puts forth
[1:55:04] another branch and he says every year
[1:55:06] that tree will put forth another branch
[1:55:08] and the same light that's in the vine
[1:55:11] will live out through the branch and the
[1:55:12] fruit that's in that Branch will declare
[1:55:15] exactly what that tree is and what am I
[1:55:17] telling you this morning we want to be
[1:55:19] more than just a message grafted in
[1:55:20] believer we want to have the the same
[1:55:22] life that's flowing in the vine living
[1:55:25] out through US producing the same signs
[1:55:27] producing the same wonders speaking in
[1:55:30] Tong interpretation of Tong oh wisdom
[1:55:32] and knowledge and all the things that
[1:55:34] God declares in his word along with
[1:55:37] signs and wonders Supernatural healings
[1:55:38] and
[1:55:40] miracles that's the sign that life is in
[1:55:44] the branch because it's producing fruit
[1:55:47] see every time that tree gets old he
[1:55:49] said it puts out a new Branch it comes
[1:55:51] forth with oranges
[1:55:52] and if the vine itself puts out a branch
[1:55:56] oh notice now he goes excuse me we tried
[1:55:59] to join members into it to live under
[1:56:01] the name of Christianity because we are
[1:56:03] it's so common of a way of saying that
[1:56:05] the citrus fruit just a Christian Church
[1:56:07] he notice there's no difference today
[1:56:09] with us as
[1:56:10] Believers we don't want to be just
[1:56:12] grafted in
[1:56:14] Christians no when we got a stream we
[1:56:17] got a fountain that's filled with blood
[1:56:20] drawn from emanuel's blame we got light
[1:56:22] Life Giving flow why do we want to be
[1:56:24] grafted in when we can be born into it
[1:56:28] in the same life notice when that vine
[1:56:32] itself puts forth a Vine it'll be like
[1:56:35] the first Vine it put forth it'll be
[1:56:37] like the first Vine it put forth they
[1:56:39] wrote a book of Acts behind that one
[1:56:41] that's
[1:56:43] wo my my my my they wrote a book of Acts
[1:56:46] behind that Branch or that vine and if
[1:56:49] he's the same today won't they write
[1:56:51] another book of Acts
[1:56:54] see if it ever puts forth another one
[1:56:56] it'll write a book of Acts behind it so
[1:56:58] God isn't interested and grafted in
[1:57:01] message
[1:57:02] Believers generational Believers hanging
[1:57:04] on to ideas of man he's looking to put
[1:57:07] forth another Branch whether you're
[1:57:09] young whether you're old he's ready to
[1:57:11] put forth another Branch he's looking to
[1:57:14] breathe the breath of life into
[1:57:16] individuals and bring forth another act
[1:57:19] believer where signs follow where you're
[1:57:21] not a afraid to face the
[1:57:24] devil brother B said the church is
[1:57:26] packing so much with this kind of
[1:57:28] society and that kind of society what
[1:57:30] about the Society of Jesus Christ we
[1:57:32] have all these other things and we've
[1:57:34] been burning the church down but now
[1:57:36] there you are he says you can never join
[1:57:38] the church you join a lodge you're a
[1:57:40] member of a lodge a group of people just
[1:57:42] like a lodge but you cannot join the
[1:57:44] church you join the lodge of members but
[1:57:46] not a church for you are born into the
[1:57:48] church and the vine itself
[1:57:52] then he said God tempered his bride
[1:57:54] together with the spirit tempered his
[1:57:57] bride together with his Spirit then it
[1:57:59] tempers the individual together with the
[1:58:01] spirit then you're born into the kingdom
[1:58:03] of God he said there is a true member of
[1:58:07] the body of Christ no kind of name
[1:58:09] tacked on to it the very works of the
[1:58:11] individual proves where he comes from
[1:58:13] his life
[1:58:14] testifies what he is and when you're
[1:58:17] born of the kingdom of God then the life
[1:58:19] the very life that was in Jesus is is
[1:58:22] living out from
[1:58:24] you you don't have to ask people to come
[1:58:26] to church you don't have to have beg
[1:58:29] people beg you to come to
[1:58:31] church no because when those doors open
[1:58:34] you can't wait to get to church now I
[1:58:36] understand look we got to fight this
[1:58:38] human nature some of you wake up some of
[1:58:40] you woke up this morning didn't want to
[1:58:41] come but you drag this old thing to
[1:58:43] church because the spirit on the inside
[1:58:45] of
[1:58:47] you so notice now let me just go on a
[1:58:50] little bit further we're going to bring
[1:58:51] this down how do we get into the church
[1:58:53] brother Joe you're born what by the
[1:58:55] Breath of God that's a direct quote
[1:58:58] breathe on me brother B says Breathe on
[1:59:00] Me Spirit of the Living God breathe on
[1:59:01] me that's my prayer just let the Holy
[1:59:04] Spirit breathe oh my for the Breath of
[1:59:07] God what is it sealed away in the
[1:59:09] kingdom of God knowing that when I first
[1:59:11] confessed I believe Jesus Christ then to
[1:59:15] my faith I had virtue and godly virtue
[1:59:17] then I add knowledge of the word now
[1:59:19] notice he starts quoting second Peter
[1:59:21] 1:5 and he says beside this give all
[1:59:24] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[1:59:26] virtue knowledge and knowledge
[1:59:28] Temperance and Temperance patience and
[1:59:30] patience godliness and godliness
[1:59:31] brotherly kindness and brotherly
[1:59:33] kindness charity for if these things be
[1:59:35] in you and abound they make you that you
[1:59:38] should neither be Barren nor unfruitful
[1:59:40] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[1:59:43] Christ when in the Blasphemous names
[1:59:45] brother B says so we're adding to
[1:59:47] knowledge Temperance and self-control
[1:59:49] then added virtue and knowledge and
[1:59:51] Temperance now I've got to add patience
[1:59:53] and he says I still ain't got the Holy
[1:59:55] Ghost
[1:59:56] yet then after I had patience I had godl
[2:00:00] you know what that is is to look like
[2:00:02] God or act like God and I add that and I
[2:00:04] don't misbehave and I I go like a
[2:00:07] Christian gentleman art to and I let
[2:00:09] that not be put on but something in me
[2:00:11] the love of God just boiling over not
[2:00:12] say uhhuh boy oh I wish I could do that
[2:00:15] but maybe I better not oh say it's it's
[2:00:17] there anyhow it's a birth I've been
[2:00:19] birthed into this into this into this
[2:00:21] and this and then the love of God Christ
[2:00:24] comes down and seals it up in me for
[2:00:27] service so he's saying add to your faith
[2:00:31] justification you start adding up and
[2:00:32] you go up that pyramid then he comes
[2:00:35] down and seals you with the Holy
[2:00:38] Ghost seals you with the Holy Ghost
[2:00:41] otherwise he gives you your adoption
[2:00:44] robe but that's what we're looking for
[2:00:46] he says then when you meet these
[2:00:47] qualifications and become a full Virtues
[2:00:49] Of God and the things of God then the
[2:00:51] Holy Spirit comes down and seals us into
[2:00:53] the kingdom don't worry everybody will
[2:00:54] know you got
[2:00:56] it come on don't worry everybody will
[2:00:58] know you got it you won't have to say
[2:01:00] well glory to God I know I got it I
[2:01:01] spoke in tongues glory to God I know I
[2:01:03] got it I dance in the spirit you won't
[2:01:05] have to say a word about it everybody
[2:01:07] will know you got it don't worry yes
[2:01:10] it'll testify of itself he will let it
[2:01:13] be known among
[2:01:15] men oh
[2:01:17] Hallelujah otherwise these signs will
[2:01:19] follow people will know that you got
[2:01:21] what you call claim to
[2:01:23] have he says but you're going to have to
[2:01:25] pay the same price have the same
[2:01:26] experience have the same thing moving in
[2:01:28] your life when God when the power of God
[2:01:33] Begin to Fall notice he tells them every
[2:01:36] man will have to pay the same price Mary
[2:01:39] had to go to the upper room the mother
[2:01:41] of
[2:01:43] Jesus so no matter what family you come
[2:01:45] from how
[2:01:47] dignified what kind of family heritage
[2:01:49] you're from no matter who your pastor is
[2:01:51] who your preacher is who the Deacon
[2:01:52] daddy is none of that mom sings the
[2:01:54] greatest specials in all the world it
[2:01:56] doesn't matter you got to come the same
[2:02:00] way yes you got to come the same way
[2:02:03] we're not getting in on Family Heritage
[2:02:05] we're getting in because we're in we're
[2:02:07] join airs with
[2:02:09] Christ but said the Holy Ghost is a real
[2:02:13] product you don't have to receive some
[2:02:15] duplicate or something wait till you get
[2:02:18] a taste of the original Mana that fell
[2:02:20] on the day of Pentecost yes sir he says
[2:02:23] there they there there was receive the
[2:02:25] Holy Ghost you know what's the matter
[2:02:26] with the church it needs a good old St
[2:02:29] Paul Revival and the Bible Holy Ghost
[2:02:31] taught it again that's right takes the
[2:02:33] fire coming down from heaven what's
[2:02:36] wrong with having a good old St Paul
[2:02:37] Revival this morning what's wrong with
[2:02:40] letting the power of the Holy Spirit
[2:02:41] fall in our church this morning do we
[2:02:44] think well it can only happen when
[2:02:45] certain preachers come
[2:02:47] no he's the same
[2:02:50] church let me bring this start bringing
[2:02:52] this down I'm not saying I'm closing so
[2:02:54] don't get
[2:02:56] scared God's characteristics
[2:02:59] characteristics excuse me Delany don't
[2:03:01] you put that on your
[2:03:03] reel put that on Note right
[2:03:06] now she knows what I'm talking about
[2:03:08] don't worry but God's
[2:03:11] characteristics will flow out through
[2:03:13] the Old Testament all the way to the New
[2:03:16] Testament cuz he is the
[2:03:19] same we find here in Psalms 146
[2:03:22] verse 5 we're going to prove this to the
[2:03:25] scriptures right now he never
[2:03:28] changes says happy is he that hath the
[2:03:33] god of Jacob for his help whose hope is
[2:03:35] in the Lord his
[2:03:37] God how many can say
[2:03:40] hallelujah which made Heaven and Earth
[2:03:42] and sea and all therein which keepeth
[2:03:44] truth forever which executed judgment
[2:03:47] for the oppressed and giveth food to the
[2:03:49] hungry now this is characteristics of
[2:03:51] God now the Lord looses the
[2:03:53] Prisoners the Lord openeth the eyes of
[2:03:56] the blind the Lord raises them that are
[2:03:58] bound down the Lord loveth the righteous
[2:04:01] these are characteristics of Christ of
[2:04:03] Jesus of God the Lord preserveth The
[2:04:06] Strangers he relieve the fatherless and
[2:04:08] the widows but the Way of the Wicked he
[2:04:10] turneth upside down the Lord shall reign
[2:04:13] forever even thy God oh Zion unto all
[2:04:16] generations praise ye the Lord now
[2:04:19] Psalms 147 and verse3 let's notice let's
[2:04:22] look at some more characteristics of God
[2:04:25] he Health the broken in heart he bindeth
[2:04:27] up their wounds he tth the number of
[2:04:29] stars he calleth them all by their names
[2:04:31] Great Is Our God and the great power his
[2:04:34] understanding is infinite the Lord
[2:04:35] lifted up up the meek and he castes the
[2:04:38] wicked down into the ground so we find
[2:04:41] these scriptures and we find this
[2:04:43] characteristics being lived out in the
[2:04:45] book of
[2:04:46] Acts Peter heals a man in Acts 3 and
[2:04:49] verse one a crippled man and acts 3: 1-1
[2:04:52] you don't have to put these up I'm going
[2:04:53] to run through them but this man was
[2:04:55] crippled from his birth but yet Peter
[2:04:57] says Silver and Gold Have I None but
[2:04:58] such as I have give I unto thee and he
[2:05:02] immediately jumped up leaping and
[2:05:04] running and praising God so we find also
[2:05:07] in Acts 5 and verse 1-10 ananas and of
[2:05:10] fire are struck dead because they lied
[2:05:12] to the Holy Spirit then we find in Acts
[2:05:14] 512 through6 the apostles perform Many
[2:05:18] Wonders then we find Peter and John
[2:05:21] begin to tell about the Holy Ghost in
[2:05:23] Acts 8 ver verse 14-1 17 then Peter
[2:05:27] heals enus of in I guess that's his name
[2:05:30] enaas I'm gonna say it like that let's
[2:05:32] just do that healed him a pausy in Acts
[2:05:34] 9:33 and 34 then immedately right after
[2:05:38] that Peter raises up Dorcas from from
[2:05:41] Death in Acts 9:
[2:05:43] 36-41 Peter delivered out of prison by
[2:05:45] an Angel in Acts 12 through verse 7-1 17
[2:05:49] then God smites Herod and miraculous and
[2:05:52] he dies in Acts
[2:05:53] 12-21 then Aus the sorcerer was smitten
[2:05:56] with blindness in Acts 13: 6-11 then we
[2:06:00] find Paul on his way to to to Damascus
[2:06:03] is struck down in Acts 9- 1-9 then we
[2:06:06] find Paul heals a in Acts 14 so
[2:06:09] we see a continual progression of the
[2:06:11] characteristics of God Paul cast out of
[2:06:13] the spirit of Divination in Acts 16 and
[2:06:16] we find that Paul and Silas prison doors
[2:06:19] open up just like they did for Peter God
[2:06:22] did it again because God never changes
[2:06:24] he opened the doors in Acts 16:25
[2:06:27] through 26 and then in Acts 19 Paul
[2:06:30] talking to him about receiving the Holy
[2:06:32] Ghost there at Corinth and they received
[2:06:33] the Holy Ghost after laying on the hands
[2:06:36] then Paul heals multitudes in Acts 19
[2:06:38] and verse 11 then we find that the young
[2:06:40] boy that fell out of the window Paul
[2:06:42] goes down and raises him back to life
[2:06:44] the same way Peter raised Dorcas back to
[2:06:46] life then we find Paul says you know
[2:06:48] what the scripture says that if they
[2:06:49] take up CPUs aite harm them then we find
[2:06:52] in Acts 28 3-6 Paul shakes off a Viper
[2:06:55] because he had a word of God declaring
[2:06:57] that he could do it then we find Paul
[2:06:58] heals publ and others so we find the
[2:07:01] same characteristics that was said in
[2:07:03] the Book of Psalms is living out in the
[2:07:06] book of Acts and what am I telling you
[2:07:08] if he's the same in Psalm he's the same
[2:07:10] in the book of act he's going to be the
[2:07:12] same in the loyaly the end time believer
[2:07:15] we can shake off the fiery serpant we
[2:07:17] can be healed in the name of Jesus we
[2:07:20] can Resurrect The Dead by the power of
[2:07:22] Jesus name what he was he is and what he
[2:07:26] did he
[2:07:29] does Brother David mayor made these
[2:07:31] comments when he preached this thought
[2:07:33] he said what's the use of the word if we
[2:07:35] don't use
[2:07:38] it what is the use of the word if we
[2:07:42] don't use it he says don't doubt the
[2:07:45] word just believe it and put it in
[2:07:47] action if you believe in the power of
[2:07:50] the word then you will see the power of
[2:07:54] God notice and I'm about to start
[2:07:56] winding this down getting ready for some
[2:07:58] testimonies brother B says his
[2:08:00] characterist
[2:08:04] characteristics I'm cutting eyes at
[2:08:07] you his characteristics continually
[2:08:10] identify him the same as he was when he
[2:08:13] lived on
[2:08:14] Earth so if the Holy Spirit and the life
[2:08:19] of Christ is living in us notice when
[2:08:21] brother Brown preached the token message
[2:08:23] he said it's the literal Life of
[2:08:26] Christ the literal life that's right not
[2:08:28] some by product not some Seminary not
[2:08:30] some denominational view but the actual
[2:08:32] life of Christ the token has come down
[2:08:35] in full obedience to the word of God
[2:08:38] entitles you to the Token
[2:08:40] life so therefore if that life is living
[2:08:43] inside of you his characteristics
[2:08:45] continually identify him the same as he
[2:08:48] was when he lived on earth he is still
[2:08:50] living here tonight in the form of the
[2:08:52] Holy Spirit he ever lives and his
[2:08:54] characteristics follow him just as it
[2:08:56] always did he is still living He said
[2:08:59] the unusualness of God the character of
[2:09:02] God had to display his characteristics
[2:09:04] in the Supernatural to show that he
[2:09:07] identified himself on the message so why
[2:09:11] does God do the supernatural to identify
[2:09:13] himself on the
[2:09:15] message he said notice the word is still
[2:09:19] the thing that identifies the
[2:09:20] characteristics of God the promise of
[2:09:23] the hour that we're living in every way
[2:09:26] he worked anytime he ever done anything
[2:09:28] he does it the same every time he
[2:09:30] doesn't he goes if he doesn't then it's
[2:09:32] his character has changed and if his
[2:09:34] character is changed and he is not
[2:09:38] God come on
[2:09:40] Church what God was he is in Joel 2:28
[2:09:45] he says I will restore to you all the
[2:09:47] years that the Locust is eating a
[2:09:49] cankerworm the Palmer worm the
[2:09:51] caterpillar he says now we had Luther
[2:09:54] Luther did not restore it was just a
[2:09:55] Reformation we had the wesle age it did
[2:09:58] not restore pentacostal age did not
[2:10:00] restore but God has to restore for he
[2:10:04] cannot deny his word this is not a
[2:10:06] restoration of the church or
[2:10:08] resurrection of the church it's the
[2:10:10] restoration of the church God will take
[2:10:13] the church right back to Pentecost of
[2:10:16] the
[2:10:17] beginning if you don't want it you might
[2:10:19] as well leave cuz that's where we're
[2:10:22] headed back to the same Pentecost back
[2:10:25] to the same sign back to the same wers
[2:10:28] back to the same anointing back to the
[2:10:30] same word same power Same Spirit same
[2:10:32] sign same same God living among his
[2:10:35] people producing the same prison bars
[2:10:38] will wake open why because we're
[2:10:40] operating under the same and I say House
[2:10:42] of Hell won't you give way this morning
[2:10:45] to the name of Jesus Christ and let the
[2:10:47] Winds of Pentecost begin to blow through
[2:10:50] here and heal broken marriages and heal
[2:10:53] broken homes and set the captive free
[2:10:56] and deliver of cancer and heartache and
[2:10:58] sugar diabetes let the power of the
[2:11:00] Winds of Pentecost blow
[2:11:04] through in the message return of Jubilee
[2:11:06] brother Bram says the
[2:11:08] Pentecostal inheritance that's your
[2:11:12] possession not a denomination not the he
[2:11:15] goes Pentecost is your possession not a
[2:11:18] Pentecostal organization your fathers
[2:11:20] came out of such but a Pentecostal
[2:11:22] experience is your
[2:11:26] possession then he says get ready to cue
[2:11:29] that picture up he goes I'm looking for
[2:11:31] a Time To Break Forth for the spirit of
[2:11:35] God in these last days that we're living

[2:11:58] of people that will believe he said the
[2:12:01] church is moving up the holy ghost power

[2:14:23] was disappointed that it didn't but 4
[2:14:25] days later he goes while she was walking

[2:17:45] positioned to speak and just curse this
[2:17:48] thing and curse the root of it and it
[2:17:50] would dry up and he goes and the next
[2:17:52] night that young man came back for
[2:17:53] prayer or was having prayer and he
[2:17:56] started rolling up his sleeves and I
[2:17:58] thought he was coming back for prayer
[2:18:00] but he showed me his arms and he was
[2:18:02] completely healed it was all dried
[2:18:06] up he's the same
[2:18:11] God received this one from brother
[2:18:14] Donnie Reagan how many of you know Colin
[2:18:15] Atkins he's a young boy young boy good
[2:18:18] friends of ours he was diagnosed on
[2:18:20] September second was
[2:18:22] Celiac I'll tell you what that is it's a
[2:18:24] disease that's triggers an immune
[2:18:26] reaction to eating gluten here's some of
[2:18:28] the symptoms eating gluten triggers an
[2:18:30] immune response to the gluten protein in
[2:18:32] your small intestine over time this
[2:18:35] reaction damages your small intestines
[2:18:37] lining and prevents it from absorbing
[2:18:39] nutrients a condition called
[2:18:41] malabsorption symptoms of diarrhea
[2:18:43] fatigue weight loss bloating anemia he
[2:18:46] goes it also can lead to serious
[2:18:48] complications if it's not managed and
[2:18:50] treated in children malabsorption can
[2:18:52] also affect the development in addition
[2:18:54] to Gastro gastrointestinal symptoms
[2:18:58] there is no known cure for
[2:19:01] celiac the doctors have no known cure
[2:19:04] for celiac so his first endoscopy
[2:19:07] endoscopy revealed that he did in fact
[2:19:10] have Celiac on September to 2022 he goes
[2:19:13] back a year later August of 2023 after
[2:19:17] being on a strict gluten-free diet and
[2:19:19] there was no chance change whatsoever he
[2:19:22] still had
[2:19:24] Celiac but in August of 2024 Sunday
[2:19:28] before his third endoscopy Callin went
[2:19:30] up for prayer and brother Donnie told
[2:19:32] him that God had found favor with him oh
[2:19:36] come on church when God finds favor with
[2:19:39] you back up devil you can't hold him it
[2:19:43] may be incurable with God but God has
[2:19:46] found favor with you evening light God
[2:19:48] has found favor with you bride of Jesus
[2:19:50] Christ and can't no Devil stay when the
[2:19:53] god of heavens and earth has found favor
[2:19:55] with
[2:19:56] you he said brother Donnie told him to
[2:19:59] that God has found favor with him no
[2:20:01] matter what the doctor's report said
[2:20:03] keep a good confession that's right that
[2:20:05] following Tuesday morning after doctors
[2:20:07] completed the scope he met me and Ruth
[2:20:09] he goes and I and he told us that he saw
[2:20:12] no
[2:20:15] celiac he saw no
[2:20:19] celiac he he said keep in mind though
[2:20:22] with the other Scopes the Celiac was so
[2:20:24] bad that the doctors could visibly see
[2:20:26] it to diagnose him he said but
[2:20:29] everything looked great appeared
[2:20:30] completely normal but noted that he
[2:20:33] could not confirm this until the
[2:20:34] biopsies come back and a week later the
[2:20:37] the biopsies came back and confirmed no
[2:20:40] celiac so what's impossible with man is
[2:20:43] possible with God what's not curable to
[2:20:46] the doctors is curable with God this
[2:20:48] morning because he's the same
[2:20:54] god brother Jason dear sent me this he
[2:20:57] said there was a woman that could not
[2:20:59] have children for nine years she came
[2:21:02] and I prayed and en cursed her and now
[2:21:04] she's pregnant glory to
[2:21:06] God brother Trevor Eman from Indiana he
[2:21:09] goes we had a sister with malignant
[2:21:11] tumor on our ovaries the doctor had an
[2:21:12] x-ray and we prayed in a prayer meeting
[2:21:15] two weeks later the doctor took another
[2:21:17] X-ray and it was gone the sister has
[2:21:19] born two children
[2:21:21] sense brother Andrew Spencer sends this
[2:21:24] and we're all aware of it but the
[2:21:25] doctors declared that brother Ron had
[2:21:27] cancer in his eye and they were going to
[2:21:28] have to remove one eye in order to save
[2:21:31] the other eye but we prayed and we
[2:21:33] believed and before they did their final
[2:21:34] test they come back that he had no
[2:21:36] cancer in his eyes what am I telling you
[2:21:38] this morning I'm telling you that God is
[2:21:40] the same and what he done in the Old
[2:21:43] Testament his characteristics did they
[2:21:45] lived out through the the book of act
[2:21:47] and throughout the New Testament it's
[2:21:48] the same God with the same
[2:21:50] characteristic and the same anointing
[2:21:52] and the same power
[2:21:54] today not just an even night
[2:21:57] Tabernacle brother Jason Watkins sent me
[2:22:00] this native people in South Pacific
[2:22:01] Islands suffering from skin Affliction
[2:22:03] small poox he said A man was going down
[2:22:06] under water to be he was covered in
[2:22:08] cankerous sores and as he immerged sores
[2:22:11] washed off and he was sealed as
[2:22:13] receiving brand new
[2:22:17] skin brother Sean Kinga many of you may
[2:22:20] may not know him but he's been to our
[2:22:21] special meeting he's a pastor of the
[2:22:23] church there in Hammond Louisiana he
[2:22:26] goes I was complaining in my going to
[2:22:28] the family doctor around September 19th
[2:22:30] of 2023 and he sent me to a specialist
[2:22:33] and the specialist called me after
[2:22:35] running test and declared that I had
[2:22:37] cancer in my
[2:22:38] scrotum he goes I remember the story The
[2:22:41] Express agent bringing the box of snakes
[2:22:43] to to John Doe's address so after the
[2:22:45] specialist hung up the phone I went on
[2:22:47] my knees I told the Lord that I was not
[2:22:49] accepting this box of snakes I refused
[2:22:51] to sign for it and I just sent it back
[2:22:54] and the specialist sent me for blood
[2:22:55] work after three three readings that
[2:22:58] recommended that they were all negative
[2:23:00] I got a call from the specialist office
[2:23:02] that they had found no cancer not only
[2:23:04] but the pain is completely gone and I've
[2:23:07] not felt it since what am I telling you
[2:23:09] over and over and over that Cancer's
[2:23:11] been defeated and Satan's been defeated
[2:23:14] and the head of the serpent has been
[2:23:16] defeated why because the same word is
[2:23:20] here today with the same power the
[2:23:23] Pentecostal winds are still blowing
[2:23:27] Church brother the Sha Martin sent me
[2:23:29] this can I go a little bit longer
[2:23:31] brother sea Martin sent me this he says
[2:23:32] a few years ago I was ministering at a
[2:23:34] church and a brother came up for prayer
[2:23:37] because he had been given six months to
[2:23:39] live due to being ate up with cancer man
[2:23:42] we've heard that word enough had we
[2:23:44] being ate up with cancer he wanted me to
[2:23:46] pray that the Lord would give him Faith
[2:23:48] to receive his healing so I asked the
[2:23:50] church to pray with me he told me after
[2:23:53] service that as he was going back to his
[2:23:54] seat something just told him that he was
[2:23:58] healed and he goes he goes he leaned
[2:24:01] over to his wife and he says I don't
[2:24:03] know what happened but I'm Healed he
[2:24:06] went back to the doctor for his checkup
[2:24:09] and the doctor was totally shocked by
[2:24:11] what he couldn't find did you hear what
[2:24:13] I said what he couldn't find he declared
[2:24:16] that their brother was cancer free and
[2:24:18] that brother is still living today he
[2:24:21] had 6 months to live let me tell you
[2:24:23] they gave Ron spriter 4 months to live
[2:24:26] but the god that we serve the same winds
[2:24:29] that blew on the day of Pentecost blew
[2:24:31] there in Virginia and the same anointing
[2:24:33] and the same result and the same
[2:24:35] Supernatural God moves on the scene for
[2:24:38] those that will believe nothing is
[2:24:43] impossible same from Brother shy says a
[2:24:46] sister in our church had been hurting in

[2:34:44] backslid well he wasn't in the service
[2:34:46] he was actually on his way somewhere
[2:34:48] else and he got into into an accident
[2:34:50] and a car struck him and hit him and
[2:34:52] pushed him into a covert he crashed into
[2:34:55] a cover and they had to cut the top off
[2:34:57] of the vehicle to get this man out of
[2:34:59] the car and the only thing that he had
[2:35:02] was a is a just a little bruise from the
[2:35:04] seat belt he was perfectly well at the
[2:35:07] same time that his wife was up there
[2:35:09] praying for the family and praying for
[2:35:11] his soul he G he comes and God spares
[2:35:14] his life and he comes into that Saturday
[2:35:16] night service and he walks up there and
[2:35:18] he rededicates his heart to God I'm
[2:35:21] telling you that God is still real and
[2:35:23] the Winds of Pentecost are still
[2:35:29] blowing let me give you a few more we'll
[2:35:31] close brother Remy he's another brother
[2:35:34] there one of the minister Brothers in
[2:35:35] the church Saturday was a life-changing
[2:35:38] experience for mostly everyone in the
[2:35:39] camp that day the presence of the Lord
[2:35:41] blessed so many people and brother Remy
[2:35:43] and his family were one of them they
[2:35:45] left the camp meeting after the bonfire
[2:35:47] that night and on their way back they
[2:35:49] were driving about 60 kmet and all of a
[2:35:51] sudden A car pulled right out in front
[2:35:52] of him oncoming traffic looking straight
[2:35:55] at them and he swerved and he I think
[2:35:57] what they C he drifted and got right to
[2:35:59] where they were just face to face and he
[2:36:01] said his wife looked in and all she
[2:36:02] could see was white hair but when he
[2:36:04] looked in he didn't see anybody in the
[2:36:06] driver's
[2:36:08] seat so he begins to pull out and go
[2:36:11] around when he look back and instantly
[2:36:13] he looked back in his rearview mirror
[2:36:15] and that car vanished and was not there
[2:36:18] see Satan has said trap but God God
[2:36:21] intercepted and God still moved and yet
[2:36:23] we find today he says brother Remy
[2:36:25] looked and saw nobody in a driver seat
[2:36:28] the headlights were on he goes it
[2:36:29] wouldn't he goes it wouldn't have been
[2:36:31] possible to him not to have seen who was
[2:36:32] in the driver's seat and the car just
[2:36:34] turned and when brother Remy looked at
[2:36:36] the car it had vanished I'm telling you
[2:36:39] he's the same God today he does the
[2:36:41] supernatural he's the same in power he's
[2:36:44] the same in anointing he's the same in
[2:36:46] every detail Church they had a brother
[2:36:49] sh a young brother who had stopped
[2:36:51] coming to church maybe on occasion but
[2:36:53] his mom got up for Sunday morning she
[2:36:55] was going to catch a bus to come to the
[2:36:56] church to be a part of the service there
[2:36:58] and it was going to take her time and
[2:37:00] she's like well I may be late so she may
[2:37:01] not go but she got ready and started out
[2:37:03] the door anyway and this young boy who
[2:37:05] didn't come to church mother be to pray
[2:37:07] for him because he didn't come to the
[2:37:08] camp meeting and she said he said mom if
[2:37:11] you'll just wait I'll go with you to the
[2:37:13] meeting she still got out there he says
[2:37:16] no she stopped her or she he had stopped
[2:37:18] her he told her if you'll wait I and
[2:37:20] I'll I'll take you to the church he she
[2:37:22] tells me this lady sends me the the
[2:37:24] testimony says brother Shadel came to
[2:37:26] church one way got a whole new person he
[2:37:29] met God personally that day brother he
[2:37:31] goes the next day he called the pastor
[2:37:33] and my dad asked for forgiveness for
[2:37:35] everything that he had done he even sent
[2:37:37] a message into the youth group with
[2:37:38] every young person and deacons and
[2:37:40] preachers on that group he texts and ask
[2:37:42] for forgiveness for every everyone from
[2:37:44] Every brother he goes our family visited
[2:37:46] that brother and his mother he was so
[2:37:48] blessed he told us that from now on
[2:37:50] anything that we need to do for the
[2:37:52] church feel free to contact him he will
[2:37:54] help whatever way possible he joined the
[2:37:56] church cleaning team and he comes to all
[2:37:58] the services and he brings his mama on
[2:38:00] time I'm here to tell you God's still
[2:38:02] able to change hearts and lives you may
[2:38:04] have come into a service one way but you
[2:38:06] can go out a different
[2:38:11] way she says our young people started a
[2:38:13] prayer chain after the Youth Camp
[2:38:15] Devil's been trying to get a hold of
[2:38:17] each of us every one of us brother but
[2:38:18] he's been doing all to tempt us and
[2:38:20] every every day at 9:00 p.m. our young
[2:38:22] people join together in prayer and we
[2:38:24] pray for specific prayers and requests
[2:38:26] and also for personal CH we are we are
[2:38:29] waiting for greater things to come and
[2:38:31] we know all caps we know that there are
[2:38:35] greater things
[2:38:38] coming and I'll end with this musicians
[2:38:42] if you make your way back brother Braham
[2:38:45] says if your life isn't compared with
[2:38:47] the book of Acts if the holy spirit that
[2:38:50] you profess to have is not making you
[2:38:53] live like they did in the book of Acts
[2:38:55] and your life could write another book
