following the word amen the word of god the white horses crown him king of kings and lord of lords for a whole millennium we'll have a whole honeymoon and then the kingdom's gonna come down here on this earth heaven will be here then what a day that will be let's talk to the lord now father we thank you today for your blessings to us oh god what grace you have given what mercies you bestowed upon us asking that you'll speak to our hearts lord one more time lord that you'd minister to the word we're just mortals that's all we are here standing in this flesh but there's an immortal life on the inside of us we have heard from eternity we have come from there and we're going back again i pray lord you'll bless us in a mighty way tonight and as we come to the communion service that you'll bless your people with your presence in the mighty way lord may we remind be reminded in the time of foot washing that we're here to serve to watch the dirt off and of another's foot lord to to encourage one another to serve you with all our hearts we ask it in jesus name amen and amen give me just a little more sound up here let's turn to joshua chapter 24 and verse 12 tonight i want to read from there if you will join with me in this this scripture reading tonight just remain standing for a moment and we always remember you know sometimes we we sometimes rejoice in the word sometimes we jump up and we we stand and we we will clap our hands but i want you to remember that's never to be done to a man that is to be done in honor to the lord jesus amen so just keep that in mind this is not about applauding a man what he said or what he didn't say or how he said it or you know something like that this is about amen giving an amen to the lord jesus and thanking him for the word is an amen that we're given amen so joshua chapter 24 verse 12 and i sent the hornet before you which drayed them out from before you even the two kings of the amorites but not with thy sword nor with thy bow and i have given you a land for which you did not labor and cities which you built not and you dwelled in them and of the vineyards and the olive yards which he planted not do you eat now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in egypt and serve ye the lord amen god bless you as you are seated my we thank thank the lord for his goodness to us and what what mercy and grace that he has given i think in there as we was reading we have things that the lord has given to us that we didn't even work for i look at looking out over a carpet that was put out in the and the flooring in the fellowship hall and the different things that we didn't work for and we didn't pay for that it was paid for and and even the labor was given and the pews that you're sitting on a man that was given to us and the equipment that we use here for our um our audio here in the service and even even the cameras that we have and that the whole thing we didn't pay for them they were paid for by a man who's a christian man but a man i've never met even yet yet he's donated a couple hundred thousand dollars to the ministry and and sending out mission work and so on like that and he's a baptist believer but he loves jesus and so we we we certainly appreciate that very much and and i i think of things that we did not pay for that we did not have to do or work for at all with our hands and god has given it to us we're a blessed people amen even as i said the cameras for the internet and everything else you know it's god that that provided aren't you glad for a wonderful provider is our lord amen he provides as i said when we dedicated this building he's more than enough and he showed himself to us more than enough now as we're looking tonight we're going to continue our thought on possessing the land and and um bringing forth the king and i hope that you know where we got today that we can take on from here and i still got a ways to go so i hope that you still brought an appetite amen if you go to sleep i'll wake you up but i hope you don't go to sleep but as we just uh look you you you pull on the on the gift of god if you will now as we think about god in his provisions and what he's given us as um as we can look and say that we have been so blessed but yet we can't say like laodicea i'm rich and increased and with goods and i have everything but but joshua you know is is saying here um you know you you've been blessed and you've been given a lot of things and you've got a great land here but uh but there's still a lack and that luck is that you must you must come and really come in with sincerity and truth if you're going to completely possess this land and you know even sometimes though we might have thought we've already given our all i think we ought to examine ourselves tonight and look one more time a little deeper in our own selves get down to the depth of the soul because whatever i don't want to miss being a part of what god's doing and i do believe that he is finalizing a great work in this last day as the plan of redemption has rolled up right down to this very hour and it takes a sincerity it takes an honesty and a genuineness and honesty and and and um expression that should be sincerity is an honesty in the expression of a true or deep feeling and this is what joshua admonished the people who were inherited in the land saying it is truly it is truly a land that is flowing with milk and honey it is abundant in the blessings of god they all lay in that land and we we often just take a mere glance at the land and you know we think of it oh it was a land that had grass and places for cattle and there were farms and communities and towns and vineyards but it was much more than that laying in the land as we ended this morning on was the burying places of abraham isaac and jacob and there was a resurrection that was promised to them and this was the greatest milk and honey that is possible you see that there would be a resurrection and that the messiah would stand there this is the ultimate this is greater than places for cattle to to grow fat with plenty of food and peaceful lands an abundant wealth but oh what a wealth that laid in this land for in this land the messiah would come in this land the king would come forth the redeemer that would bring full redemption hallelujah i'll tell you we're living in the age as i feel the holy spirit move upon me amen that is that we're living in the age not a partial redemption but a full redemption amen of a resurrection where there will be an ascension where there'll be a people alive and remain at the coming of the lord who will not hinder those that are asleep we're living in one of the greatest hours that there's ever been on the face of the earth and you need not look back and say oh i wish i'd have been back there because i tell you you are in the greatest hour of this world's history right now they had disentered in here and they were inherited and then too often we look at the surface oh ah this is a great soil here to grow corn here a great olive trees and olive groves that have been planted and we can have oil and we can have peaceful fields for our cattle to grow and what would be a nice place to raise the children and and so we can have nice families and a nice church and we can offer sacrifices here but god was one to give them something much greater than that and i wanted to say you too have been blessed by receiving this message amen the word that we have inherited has given us great blessings you have wonderful things that god has blessed you with natural blessings that lay in this world there are natural blessings just that come just by following god's word you can have happy homes amen you can have good marriages you can have well-behaved children it's milk and honey that's what this word will produce amen it will produce uh uh you know a good church it'll produce lovely people it'll produce good singing come on it'll produce wonderful worship and man all of these things are wonderful and they're desirable and they're great and they're oh it's milk and honey but even in possessing all of that that's really not what god's wanting to give you hallelujah he's wanting to give you the resurrection of all the saints he's wanted to give you the change of your body he's wanting to bring about an ascension and that there be a rapture that'll take place in this age god wants to give you more than a good church amen a good community of believers among good nice people to be around and nice families to have and good children and i'll tell you the message produces all of that but god wanted to give more than that i heard a song the other day that just flashed back in my mind a gospel song that i don't know i think it was mark bishop that sang it i don't really know his singing but anyway i took note of it and was talking about lazarus where jesus wept and he said you know in the song the way that he brought it he didn't weep when he'd heard that lazarus died he didn't weep when he when he um walked even even just to see the tomb that he laid down in and and that that's what made him cry but in this song that it brought it out and i never thought of it like that and said but when he wept he wept because he had to bring him back amen really what god wants for us are you with me amen is to take us to his home to be with him forever to take us out of this old wretched life of mortality and take us into a life of immortality that's what god wants for his children all these things as i said are wonderful but god wants to give more it's a feast of milk and honey and there are more aspects of it it will help you with your finances i mean just the blessings of tithing those blessings that follows just that little principle the little simple things that god's word said about conducting your business and your finances just being a christian amen those things are wonderful but to achieve that is not to achieve the goal i hope you can see the picture that i'm trying to paint here amen i hope you can begin to see where my heart is today that's why i cannot be satisfied with having a good church a nice building plus pews like i said there are gifts of god that were given to us amen i have carpet on the floor and i have a nice building and all of that that that is dear god if that's our reward we're not rewarded very much do you hear what i'm saying amen that's not what we want you see uh i'm not just satisfied with someone reforming somebody and then being good to their wife or learning to be to live right or to treat their family right or be a good daddy to their children now all of those things are part of the land i mean they're part of the milk and honey that they're that we eat of but there's something that is beyond that it is the goal of the ages that our sight is set upon amen we are here in this land we are here to bring forth the messiah the king to bring jesus back to earth again is somebody with me amen that's really why the word has come not to give you a good family and a good home and a good church or a little healing campaign or a temporary healing god wants to do more than that he wants a people whose heart instead of one thing let us bring back the king in the greek this word sincerity means purity and it means to serve with a pure heart and so but as as he was saying let's serve the lord with sincerity and truth that means completely holy entirely in accord with truth now you're in this land and you're you who are now inheriting this remember what he wanted them to inherit was the resurrection and the messiah that's what they were coming back to the land for amen they were coming to meet the messiah so the redeemer could come amen and they were there to come to that land to build to prepare a place to get a place ready for the messiah to come amen that's what we've been called back for amen is to to the promised land of the word is so that we can bring we can bring forth the king amen the reason is not to start a new church that we can call them message churches amen that's not what this and if this is what it's about i quit amen i i don't want any more of it if that's what it's about just to have another group of people that are a little different from the baptists and the methodists and the presbyterian and they got a little different philosophy and you know they meet in a little different building and they dress in a little different way amen if that's all it's about i quit but i want to tell you it's more than that amen it's more than that it is that redemptive promise will be fulfilled in a people in this last day amen partial redemption given away to full redemption joshua 23 verse 14 he would tell them i am going away this day of uh go in the way of all the earth and you know in your hearts and in your souls that not one thing has failed of all the good things which the lord your god spake concerning you all are come to pass on you and not one thing has failed thereof listen god's true to his word amen he promised us good homes we got him he promised us good marriages that will last till death do us part amen we got them they made promises good children we have them he promised us wonderful churches we have them he promised us divine healing we have it amen not one good promise has ever fallen to the ground he keeps all of his word but i want you to notice in order to possess it then it's going to have to go back to the commission of joshua 1 and 3 every place that the soul of your foot has tread shall tread upon that i give to you you're going to have to possess it amen the forerunner the forerunner's job was to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers and i just want to say god has kept his part of the bargain malachi 4 has been fulfilled luke 17 30 revealing of the son of man all that many many scriptures have been have been fulfilled and god has kept his part of the bargain by bringing us into this word but i wonder sometimes have we kept ours have we kept our part because you see it required it required some people moving in faith and putting their foot on a divine promise now in the book of judges it kind of breaks my heart as it starts out after everything that god promised to do and yet in judges 9 is 119 it says judges 1 19 and try to follow these scriptures if you can and the lord was with judah now that ought to be enough to shout about and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountains but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley now first of all the lord was with them amen well look like if the lord was with them they could have driven out those in the valley but they couldn't do it because you see they were cherries of iron because because they had a greater army more equipment because the obstacle was greater and so therefore they did not drive out them in the valley then we find out in judges 1 21 and the children of benjamin did not drive out the jebesites that inhabited jerusalem but the jebusites dwelt with the children of benjamin in jerusalem unto this day the holy city the city of the king and yet they failed to possess it and then in verse 27 neither and this is how it goes into it neither dead and neither dead and neither did as it talks about the failures of those who were given the land i'll tell you church it's time that somebody breaks the cycle come on there are parts of the word we want to fulfill there are parts of the word we don't want to fulfill and i'll tell you what when it comes down to the book of judges where it says neither we don't want to fulfill that part we want to possess every bit of what's been given to us come on church amen verse 31 said neither did i answer and then it says you know but in verse 32 but the asteroids dwelt among the canaanites and the inhabitants of the land for they did not drive them out then verse 34 in the amorites and they forced the children of dan into the mountain for they would not suffer or allow them to come down in the valley now here we go again the enemy the devils demons standing on the promise of god on land that is our inheritance given us to god that god swore i bring you to and yet not enough faith to go down into that valley and possess that that and so they have to remain in the mountain couldn't go down in the valley and they're hiding among the rocks there now you see the first generation served the lord but the grandchildren did not and remember this god doesn't have any grandchildren he only has sons and daughters of god but you know we wind up having you know in our churches we wind up with church full of grandchildren they're just come along because well i was born in the message and i'm born in this church and i'm born in this movement and i'll tell you you know i will tell you if you've been born here you are blessed people you're a blessed person i dedicated the little winter's child i dedicated that daddy i dedicated that mama amen they were they were raised up here on the pews of this church but i'm just going to tell you again maybe they cut their teeth here and they were raised up here in this church but i'm telling you god doesn't have any grandchildren every person has to be born again of the same spirit of the almighty god every generation has to have their own revival now as we looked at that in chapter 2 and verse 11 and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and served balaam hardly a generation has passed since the forerunner and they pursued the lord god of their fathers which brought them out of the land of egypt and followed other gods the gods of the people that were round about them and bowed themselves to them and provoked the lord to anger and they pursued the lord and served baal and asteroth and the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he delivered them into the hands of the spoiler that spoiled them and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about and that so that they could not stand any they could not any longer stand before their enemies this is a sad plight for a people that god had given the promise to a people who would have the faith of abraham are people who were to bring forth the king who had been brought back to this land for the the express purpose of the redeemer to come and what happens to them they get to where they can no longer stand against their enemies there's no longer any faith to stand against cancer no longer faith to stand against diseases no longer faith to stand against sin whether or so ever they went out their hand the lord was against them for evil as the lord said and as the lord has sworn unto them and they were greatly distressed nevertheless the lord raised up judges which delivered them out of the hands of those that spoiled them and yet they were not hearkening to their judges and they went whoring after other gods and bowed down themselves to them and they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in obeying the commandments of the lord but they did and they did not sow so over and over the cycle of revival failure and death begins a vicious cycle a revival of failure and a revival and then failure and then from failure to death and another judge will rise up and again lead them in a revival and a move of god only for them to fail is somebody with me amen and then go down to the death again you see this is the very type of our church ages are you with me amen here god gave the holy ghost opened up the land on the day of pentecost but what happens is somebody with me now what happens to them they start in this cycle of revival failure death revival failure and death and god will raise up another messenger and bring another revival and then there will be failure the next generation and then death and then he'll start again and send another judge and he'll send and another move of the spirit and another revival and then failure and then death looks like pretty bleak but as i was reading the book i started to read the book of joe the judges actor joshua the lord that directed me right over into the book of ruth because right there in the book of ruth while the church ages are going on while the judges are doing their work i mean there there is somewhere in the midst of the judges here comes a ruth amen here comes a book outside of the judges the story of another people hallelujah another woman and this woman is ruth and she's a gentile come on she's a gentile woman but she was a woman there who said i'll leave things behind i'll leave my people behind i'll leave my life behind and my god's behind but i want to go to that promised land because there was something down on the inside of her that said i want that seed for a woman in my womb i want to bring forth the king now maybe she couldn't verbalize it but there was a drive down on the inside of that little gentile woman hallelujah amen while the others are going through this vicious cycle here comes another woman out amen leaving her people leaving her god's behind to become one of the people of the book to be a womb to receive the king's seed from the tribe of judah amen like rahab her womb never carried the seed of other men are you with me but her womb was reserved so she could be one of the mothers of the king messiah hallelujah she went back and then she would begin there ruth deciding justification a man's way back there in luther's day to to wesley's day of ruth serving works sanctification somebody with me now to ruth resting the baptism of the holy ghost a deposit hallelujah when the promise was given to her of the deposit remember he said open up open up your your your um open up your veil i want to just pour some measures down in there and then she filled or full and said you i'm not sending you home empty i'm giving you the deposit and there's more to come oh if you've got the blessed holy spirit today amen i say that's wonderful and that's good but it's a deposit and it only says there's more to come hallelujah there's more to come of it she would dare finally come to the point where she was rewarded and her reward was a whole lot more than handfuls on purpose amen her reward was boaz amen she received the land and the seed life of the king for from her would come would come from boaz and ruth would come over and from all the jesse and jesse david who would be the the the very prototype of the king of kings the lord of lords so now ruth had come a gentile bride and as i said boy as it started his work of redemption already the kinsmen redeemer is heading toward opening up the inheritance amen boaz started his work with justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost unto bringing forth a child to lay in the lap of naomi the jewish church so now but while there is a move of god and god's got a plan the ages the church ages are cycling on the judges are cycling on and there you know it winds up with the last judge was eli who allowed corruption in the priesthood and the ark of the covenant was lost amen the word was captured by the enemy and taken out of the land of promise amen now so again there was no open vision in the days of samuel therefore where there's no vision the bible say the people perish we must have vision that visions comes to profit and it's the word of the lord that has spoken to them but now eli wasn't a prophet eli was a priest and he was getting old and his eyes were going dim and he couldn't see around and he was a great heavy man and he began to let the work of the lord go undone that's the condition as we end the church ages the work of the lord being undone miracles and signs and wonders gone the a living god is not present it's a historical god and when the resurrection is not preached in power the work is being left undone and and i just want to say if we're not careful we will find ourselves in that same groove perpetuating the ages somebody with me now amen let's look at this for a minute because we cannot afford to perpetuate the ages there's got to be some cycle breakers hallelujah i'll tell you this age will go down into death like all the other ages this age will go into corruption like all the other ages are you with me but there is a people in this age that will be a cycle breaker amen because it says the those that are alive and remain that somebody's still going to be alive [Music] a people who know their god and who can do exploits oh oh you know i think of what we have been given and we settle down as if we're another church age and maybe maybe you know you say well the work of the lord's not being undone brother tim we're still printing books we're still printing books we're still distributing gospel material so are they and i just want to say this church evening like tabernacle threw a burden in this in the hearts of the brothers here moving out there went in japan where there was not a message church at all whether there was no no group of believers there where there was no not one sermon that was translated into the japanese language and i want to say that by god's grace today evening like tabernacle has translated somebody with me 134 sermons of brother branham's right now that's the count that we have put upon the message hub where it can be read around the world amen and plus you know i've written three books for outreach on water baptism and on the on the cummins of elijah and then on the serpent seed and they have been translated now into many languages we just recently helped in uganda print thousands of copies in differently in several different languages to be a part of that revival there to establish them on the word of god amen they're now in norwegian and they're down in three different languages listen this is not to puff me up it's not about me it wasn't even my message i wrote these things for outreach not even for believers to reach out to new people and but let me just say but if we're not careful we're only changing people's opinion from one philosophy to another giving them a better knowledge of the word and baptizing them with water and i want you to say i'm all for that i rejoice in every baptism and i rejoice for every book published amen and we have helped we have helped build a church building i just finished one inside um i think it was zambia the country of zambia i just finished one where they just had a little shock couldn't stay out from under it because it it was just a a leafy the things money from your pocket help do that and we just finished a building for those saints to be able to worship in a little building that they killed fired out of made handmade bricks and made their own and put sheet metal on top of it and they got a place to worship and i want to say i'm thankful for every one of those church buildings and especially when i look out here and see what god's given us and see over that there somehow we lifted the burden of some little group but don't stop there where's the feeling of the holy ghost you know it's a false assumption to think that because they received church occur the current correct theology that they have the holy ghost that's not the holy ghost that's a baptist philosophy just receive this doctrine just say christ is my savior and this is what the message in large has done around the world they have brought a badness theology of just accepting god's sent a prophet and we have a message you receive that you got the holy ghost that ain't the holy ghost the holy ghost is an experience it's where god comes down in a life and changes him forever no it's not tongues and it's not a jump and it's not a shout we know all of that but i'll tell you when it comes there is something that moves on the inside and it's more than a reformation it's a power of transformation and the quote brother branham and when we try to educate the church to fellowship when we try to educate the people to christ we're just batting the air we're getting nowhere there's only one way that man or woman can come to christ and that's through the blood of jesus christ and being born again and you're not born again until you receive the holy ghost as he would say in in this message in 1965 i'm afraid that too many of us are not getting people to christ we're getting them to a church to a theory but we must get him to christ he is the only one and the only one that has life he that has the son has life and finally the judge is in like our church ages we're the priesthood and his corrupt sons and god raising up a prophet amen in that day it was by the name of samuel but can you imagine can you imagine here you know the corruptness that is happening with with religion as some man told brother our our lady actually told brother wayne on the plane brother wayne lawson was talking to her and she said i don't have an interest in church well all it's about in our lutheran church is a bunch of old people arguing over the money and that's about the way it ends you know running by committees and we'll get this preacher in and you know it's kind of like it just minutes when they were when they were were had to have a bigger larger building and they they got out of there into a little gymnasium of another church and and then they were beginning to preach and because there were more room people came and because and then the the movement of the holy spirit was taking place and there was rejoicing and shouting and they they tried to buy the building from the from the to the denominational church so let's let's just buy it you're you're just a handful of people said oh no we know what you've done we can see what you've done we we know you you y'all just got you a young preacher and with some new songs and things and and brought an enthusiasm in we're going to do the same thing we're going to fill this building up you see that's what they think they think it's a it's just about singing and worshiping and jumping or or some enthusiastic young preacher but it's more than that amen where the carcass is the eagles will gather amen but what is it that judges in as our church agents did with a corrupt priesthood corrupt sons can you imagine some like the methodist with homosexuals in their pulpit those who le and those ministers that lay with women adulterers preachers who divorced and married two or three times you got double married preachers in the pulpit can you imagine you know there they they they they get so in need of preachers that put women up to preach can you imagine they get in such a condition there in the in their whole ministry until there's drunks in the pulpit and they're getting arrested for drunk driving are you with me amen you know again what is it it's the corrupt ending of the church ages but in the middle of that god was sending a prophet hallelujah that was samuel he would have been a he was a just man a good man honorable reputable true honest with the people never deceiving them telling them that nothing but straight thus saith the lord and out of the thousands of visions it never failed can't you follow my parallel can't you see what we're talking about where we're at god's sending a prophet in this day with thousands upon thousands of visas never failed he wasn't a compromiser he wouldn't compromise on a holiness he wouldn't compromise for sin he would not compromise for money or popularity he could not be bought he could not be bribed he could not be coaxed so you know i'll give you we'll give you an airplane and we'll we'll get you out here among the who who's and we will give you a great ministry and we'll promote you but you just got to leave your your teaching behind you see eli was blind and israel was led by blind judge and a corrupt priesthood what a sad way to end the ages sons of eli laying with the women who came to worship stealing them stealing and taking by force the meat of the sacrifice and these abuses were just overlooked just swept under the rug by the priesthood but the bible said that the boy samuel ministered to the lord before eli and the word the lord was rare in those days and there was no widespread revelation i say god don't ever let us get that where the word the lord is rare god's speaking to his people like we were hearing this morning well when brother du plessis testimony it's got to be where the saints of god are in tune with god and can hear his voice men and women led by the spirit of god and it came to pass while eli was laying down in his place and his eye had begun to grow dim and he could not see then before the uh the lamp of god went out in the tabernacle of the lord where the ark of god was and that's about the way it is in the churches today sin is not rebuked it's not dealt with churches become rich sins become rampant a form of godliness but denying the power thereof and there is no vision and the word of god is rare the judge is in with eli blind and dying and the ark the word of the lord shaken and children birthed out of that called ichabod meaning the glory of the lord has departed brother branham said and let people shake themselves tonight and flee from the route that is to come for ichabod is written over the doors and over the nations a black checkmark has come across it the spirit of god has grieved away from it and there weighed in the balances and found warning you see even among the churches that claimed to be free claimed to be in the truth claimed to break in this broken the cycle they don't have any desire to see a soul saved it's all about what's in our four walls it's all about us for and and no more you know and and brother branham would you know would talk about a man because you see they have no burden to see souls saved and you even hear preachers say i don't want to see any souls snapping around at my altar brother branham said i've been to places and people supposed to be spirit-filled people see all their calls made and why you couldn't get anybody to pray with them it shows that it's ichabod the spear the lord has departed but when you see that zeal and fire and longing and long for human souls and he said any religion that hasn't got the blood life of jesus christ behind it the death angel is on it right death angel separated from god yes indeed ichabod is wrote on every bit of it that hasn't got the blood you say well i'm glad the blood but he said it the blood hasn't taken effect if it hasn't taken effect and you see it in your life as a consecrated child of god with what jesus said would they take place then be careful you might have something else besides the blood you might have a little injection of theology in there or something or a little injector injection or some sensation or say i quivered i shook i danced i did this be careful see you can go to either extreme do it don't just talk about don't just pick on the emotional side amen but also realize there are some that's all they got is an injection of theology and that's just as wrong as going to the other side it's a balanced walk that we must have said if the if the medicine ever strikes you it's good for every human being it'll save from sin it'll clean up from the life of sin it'll make a different person out of you it'll take the doubt away it'll make you a new creation in christ jesus and that's the spirit of this nation big time somebody television program lots of jokes to be cracked why that makes a real christian sick at his stomach to hear of such things a man or woman can look at that kind of stuff that we have on tv today and some of them programs and enjoy it shows that ichabod is right over the top of your heart the glory of the lord has departed and when the church loses its attraction when it comes to time do you have to sign cards and things to come to church i think it's time for a prayer meeting or something to take place in the church amen and in the church christ ought to be the attraction amen you know a church should be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water it don't wither i don't care if it comes dry season or wet season or this season or that problem or that problem or whatever its tree its roots are in the rivers of living water its leaf it doesn't wither amen you know that brother branham talked about this in planting divine he said it's like david said again in psalms and blessed is the man that will not join up with the scoffers and ungodly people remember that's one of the signs if you listen to the rapture one of the very signs of the rapture is more than the shout voice and the trump one of the signs that scoffers rise in the last days you see there's some fulfilling that other part and i just want to say be real careful about your scoffing when you want to scoff at the baptism of the holy ghost when you want to scoff at somebody weeping their way to calvary when you want to scoff at the tears rolling down their face and something more than a dried-eyed confession and you want to scoff at it it's because the ichabod is written over you your leaf has withered it's got verses say days of miracles have passed and the baptism of the holy ghost is just make belief i'm quoting brother branham blessed is a man that'll not do that blessed is a man that stand forth from such a thing they don't want to mix those together you can't mix those things together blessed is a man who want to assemble himself unto one of those that denies the power of the lord the bible said come out from among such for the day will come they'll be heady high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away blessed is a man that will not assemble himself with these scoffers making fun call in the true church a bunch of fanatics amen oh brother raven said blessed is the man who will not who will not assemble himself with those cattle scoffers he will be like a tree planted by the rivers of water god put him in a choice spot his fruit shall not wither he will bring forth his leaves and his fruits and his season watch how david worded that this man is blessed he will be planted not just set out you know i see anything planted israel and egypt was not planted they were set out but it wasn't their original home ground and that's a christian that rested eternal destination upon um some domino creed denominational creed he's not in his right place he was born to be free a child of god to worship god but he's under a creed and he can't bring forth his fruits yet something in him is longing to do it he shall be like a tree that's planted by the rivers rivers plural waters singular many rivers coming from one channel in other words he'll be like a man in the scripture that believes all the word of god where the power and the nine spiritual gifts that flow through one god and to his inner most being people don't believe in shouting the thing of it is they haven't got spiritual joy and the joys of the water of life can flow through that's what's in my home what's matter with branham tabernacle because that unbelief the cares of the world has bound the people until it cannot produce spiritual growth and that's what's the matter with our nation that's what's the matter with our churches they have no joy and the joy of the lord is departed as it's written one time in the scripture the hebrew word of ichabod which means the presence of the lord has departed that's over our churches because we left off for the original foundation and he even said branham tabernacle a message church now the people want a king god has sent him a prophet but they want a king notice the desire the people god is about to give him a king he's already been working there's ruth of moabitus deciding working serving somebody help me meeting the kinsmen redeemer amen and she see there gets bow eyes and she receives the seed life and it's on its way it's about here and just before the king comes the people want one of their own choosings now you're seeing where i'm going now here this picture comes in god's about to give him king one after his own heart one that he can be king through and i'll tell you what god is about to give us the king the messiah the lion of the tribe of judah his advance in heaven is moving the king is coming the title is being handed to a bride as he calls for his queen to come stand by his side but before the king can come before the rapture can consummate the people select assault of the wrong tribe are you with me at the wrong lineage oh he's an israelite but he's of the tribe of benjamin and the word of the lord has been that out of judah will the scepter come and he will rule my people i'm going to be giving you a king but he'll come out of judah but before he can come out of judah they select a man of their own choosing a son of kiss and i want you to listen to me the son of kiss he only perpetuated the judges it was only a continual cycle of revival hope disappointment and failure and death now when i'm preaching this i'm not i am not pointing to one certain son of kiss because there are thousands of them there are men with the spirit of organization the denominational mindset that rules laodicea is the organizational life that people want you know i just go to church when i feel like it maybe sometimes if i'm a good christian two or three times a week and do my religion but don't have a personal everyday walk with christ i heard of a man here the other day was told of a young man that was boasting i'm blessed everything i tell touch turns to gold but i don't read my bible every day and i don't pray every day and yet god still blesses me what is it it's an organizational life and it's an organizational life that people want amen you know again you know you see a life a life of a believer must follow jesus every day you've got to be just as real of a christian on monday as you were on sunday and on tuesday as you were on monday and on wednesday as you were on tuesday and all the way through it's an everyday walk brother branham is your life where the gospel he said israel walked day and night by the pillar of fire when the pillar of fire moved they moved with it and remember it was a fire at night in the cloud by days it might come day or night any time but whenever it was there was a perpetuation made that they would not fail to see it it was the light at night the cloud in the daytime and they followed it yes sir same thing martin luther saw it what did he do he came out of catholicism but what did they do they built a little fence around and said we're lutherans this is it wesley come along moving from there and he went what'd they do built a little fence around and said this is it what the light do moved right on pentecost saw it and what they do moved out of the west with the nazarenes and so forth what'd they do they built a little fence around and said we're oneness we're trinity and we're united and what'd he do god moved right out of it we cannot do that we got to follow every day every hour the day every step of the way we got to be led by the lord jesus christ if we don't we take an organizational life and a life that doesn't follow christ daily is not worthy the real king was to be the holy spirit leading and before but before the people could bring on a man who would allow god's leadership and be king through him they rejected the king that's where we are the king is being rejected i'm talking about the holy spirit i am not talking about some man i'm talking about holy spirit leadership in individual life and the king has been rejected and the intellectual men are chosen instead sons of kiss rising up now sons who kiss are good israelites they're handsome and their head and shoulders above all the others but you is never to be led by intellects recently just recently i heard a son of kish defending the use of psychology and stated that the holy spirit is the greatest psychologist psychologist that ever was saying i think psychology has its place when it's used by the holy spirit and i want you to say the holy spirit has never used psychology you know to think of it given a description of the holy spirit as the greatest psychologist think of that if that isn't a son of kiss polished educated smart intellectual and that's the kind of ministry that wants to rise up you're showing you that showing they don't know the power of god you see psychology has no place in the ministry it has no place in our literature we never needed dr dobson before and we don't need him now we don't need their books of psychology then and we don't need them now we got one book that we need and that's the bible the word of god are you with me psychology has no place in the ministry god doesn't need it and god doesn't use it and if you think that the holy ghost is the greatest psychology there ever was then you don't know the holy ghost you've never known this power you've never known it's life-changing abilities see psychology is the study of the mind how it works how it affects behavior psychology is man's attempt to fix a spiritual problem by education it's man fixing another man without the spirit of god trying to do what only god can do without god fixing the people you see psychology is just changing the mind trying to change the behavior amen that's not what we preach amen we preach preaching nature change what the old man of sin is dead and you're risen in christ we preach a resurrection a psychologist treats a patient through psychotherapy help or you know hoping to relieve the symptoms through behavioral change the role as a psychiatrist is is a medical doctor focusing more on practice and medication and other inventions to manage the mental health conditions but i i want you to know that you see the holy spirit is not a psychologist and he's not the greatest psychologist everyone he's the greatest discerner of the heart the deliverer of the bound the deliverer of the tormented amen the gospel does not relieve fear by behavioral change fear is an evil spirit it's a tormenting spirit and the holy spirit casts out devils amen that's mark 16. amen it did not say we'll use psychology on them said in my name we'll cast out devils [Applause] the holy spirit was not performing psychology on someone when discerning the cause of their sickness he was showing where the demon of fear had attached himself to that person and started causing their illness and that's why we don't need sons of kiss in the pulpit we need god called men who know the power of god amen that aren't trained to use psychology but are trained by the holy ghost to cast satan out brother branham said in israel in the church and by the way i've been listening to that series too he said i believe we're on the borderline tonight oh god where are we now this is 1953. maybe we're maybe we're in there i was wondering all about my meetings and things how i had to cancel them out i truly believe before the church can have the rapture it's got to have rapture and faith we can't have faith for divine healing let alone alone rapturing faith got to have faith that would change and quicken this body and be taken away i believe there's a church on this road tonight a power of the living god that men will speak the word here and there and it'll flash like lightning and a church is coming out not a psychologist not something that's put on make-believe but a real true genuine anointing holy ghost called out church hallelujah that's what's here tonight amen that's what we want an evening like tabernacle a holy ghost to knowing it called out church not putting out some behavioral change and changing your mind and causing you to take this philosophy and trade it for another it's more than that it's the power of transformation that makes and turns a center into a child of god the baptism of the holy ghost the king is rejected laodicea is chosen rejected and the intellectual conception allowed to be king and you can never live an overcoming life with an intellectual son of kiss as king oh they want something they can call sane and sensible where you just embrace a doctrine but there's never been a visitation from the presence of the lord in invisible union he said neither can you bear god's son word god's word son neither can the church bring forth they don't want one of them screaming children shouting speaking in tongues and all them things yeah they you can't do that in a denominational church you can't do it in a kiss church either they won't have you they won't bring them like that they'll take them up and shake their hands and say i believe you got it as long as you put your name on the book that's all you have to do see it's illegitimate children do the word and still claim religion as he said satan don't care how religious you are or how right you are in your doctrine amen if you miss that life you won't come up anyhow no matter how religious how good how many churches you belong to or will belong to it doesn't matter one thing unless you've been born again it says the enemy tries to say that age of miracles are past there's no such thing as a baptism of the holy spirit that this is only emotion it's only a workup so the enemy is challenged and his challenge must be met this end-time evangelism and the day the scientific theory of the modern so-called religious group has tried to prove that this blessed thing that we have called the holy spirit is only emotion that's what the scoffers are saying now it's just emotion you know and they don't stand up according to their scientific theory well i'd like to ask them this what makes them change what makes the drunkard stop drinking amen what makes a prostitute cease or evil life amen what makes the cancer and diseases depart from the people and the death to dumb the blind of the dead to raise up explain that is that emotion it has emotion with it certainly certainly certainly anything that's alive has emotion and anything that doesn't have emotion is dead excuse expression but i think we ought to bury some of our emotions religion then because it's dead it has no emotion in it in religion that has not emotions should be buried aha because it is emotional hallelujah amen you can't tell me the presence of christ comes down and you're and you just stand there and oh well i didn't ever know it even happened you see they might come as studious intellectual educated man or in some cases now here's where it is in some cases even come disguised as a move of god with much fanfare and with shoutings and great expressions of emotion and great worship but watch it it's a move it's a anointing of a son of kish not with the anointing of god but the anointing of man to build up a kingdom now this message started with divine healing and the power of god it will end with a massive move of total divine healing it'll be so glorious that hair will come back the right color amen it'll be so glorious that wrinkles will fall off and the skin becomes glorified cripples will run and blind will see and death will hear and old age will fade away in a miraculous movement and a moment in the twinkling of an eye this message started out with the visitation of an angel and healing faith and it will end with a climax of rapturing faith the king will come are you with me it started out casting out devils for salvation not a 12-step aaa meeting where you learn to cope with your problem amen will you learn to cope with your problems so you don't reach for the bottle when you're having a problem when you get up and you still declare i'm an alcoholic i'll always be an alcoholic but i've learned that that behavior is not healthy and that sounds like a lot of so-called christians i'm a sinner i'll always be a sinner but i've learned you know that some of that behavior just ain't healthy so i try to be good it's not a learned behavior it's a deliverance a deliverance from the demons of hell that's pulling through your appetites salvation then becomes with people and the intellectual approach to changing behavior that's what sons of kiss will do shining army higher head and shoulder above the head of all that's around him his words are polished with education i was in a men's meeting and they called on a man to testify of how he overcame how he overcame pornography you know he had a bad pornography habit and he was a married man and he said what i've done brothers i've learned to associate pornography with pain the pain that was causing my wife and family and the harm it was doing and so now that's how i've overcome pornography that is not overcoming now i'm not even talking about i'm not even talking about brother's keeper program what was that called promise keeper program i'm talking about message people talking about their deliverance in such a way that's not deliverance overcoming pornography is recognizing that it's sin and i need a savior i need a holy ghost baptism that i take away and deal with a sin nature that's on the inside of me that has an appetite that's pulling through my body pornography the holy ghost takes away the desire of sin we want something besides the holy ghost to be king over us we'll adopt psychology we'll adopt some other system of man rather than have an outpouring of the holy ghost because we don't know snotting over in our altars we don't want no tears we don't want no dying out we we want you to become insane and sensible saying unsensible we want a king what we want is somebody to tell us what to do you know today we already got like the baptists as a baptist preacher told me one time he said i don't know how you do it you get up and preach two hours at a time i could never do that i've been a preacher for years and i could never do that said well i'll tell you what all i do is i get this little letter here from the church and i get up and i i read my sermon to them and said it's over in 15 minutes i don't know where you where you got all of that stuff that you're preaching i don't know i don't know where all that comes from how do you preach like that you see we they what the baptist got to do they had so many sons of kiss that all they did was send them a program here is what you're to preach on this week and we're doing the same thing here's the tape we want you to play we don't want you to preach we want you to play this tape and all your churches it ain't nothing more than a than a summer kiss rising up trying to be king when the holy spirit has to be king come on now amen but that's what people want they want somebody to do your religion for you where you don't pray where you don't ask god for leadership are you with me amen you know you want someone else to tell you what to do so you'll have somebody else to blame when you fail you know you hear sometimes you hear people and they just go on and on the deacons did this and the preacher did this and they didn't handle that right and they did well what about you what about you failed parents what about you backslidden daddy and you want to blame it because why you are trying to make saul your king would you ever get the holy ghost as your king you quit blaming preachers but while you turn out the way you are you quit blaming the deacons you quit blaming the other church members and they let us down you'll save god it stops right here the buck stops right here i know i need the holy ghost in my life to lead my family and it hadn't been led by the spirit of god you want to sit backslid and then your kids turn out bad and the deacons have to turn them out of the church and then you blame them your own behavior turn them out of church your own backslidden ways turn them out of church you need the holy ghost you got saul as your king you've rejected the king oh i know that's cutting hard go listen to the tape brother branham didn't cut no slack and i'm not playing games i'm i'm serious amen i'm very i'm serious as i can be about this you know the rejected king they would brother branham told us they looked upon the philistines the malachites the amorites are hittites they want to pattern like these kings they want to be like these you know you know just give us a place to come to church and tell us what to do and you know we'll do our religion we'll go home and and chaos is in the home santa's in the home no prayer meeting in the home he's not king christ is not king though but you got a saul you got a son a kiss that'll tell you what to do just believe this creed learn this greek word you're going in the rapture you're all right you're going to hell is what you're doing or into the tribulation but there's you know never been an age in any time that god's intention was for us to act like the world you know god's people are to be a peculiar people a different people are called out people are separated all together in their actions their ways their manner of living than what the world has and brother branham warned us over and over hear me across the nation and across the world and in this church only god's only provided place of worship he said now you notice every three years after a great meeting what takes place a denomination and this has been 20 years and no denomination dear dying lamb may it never do that if i go in this generation may the people who believe this message never stand still for a denomination you'll die right in your track remember the very hour you mentioned denomination among you i don't care how sincere you are take man for your leader instead of the holy spirit to confirm this word that's the hour you die the genuine seed cannot because there's nothing left after the seed you see it's the same thing that was back at the beginning it's the pride that fell at the ground to bring forth the corn of wheat again and there's nothing past the grain we're at the end of the cycles oh brother tim ah we're no denomination you can have an organizational life sitting right in the evening like tabernacle remember like divorce is not the paper god hates it's the behavior you can behave like a divorced couple no love no respect possessive controlling hateful mean and still be married and you don't have to have the paper organization to be denominated in fact to the battery is brother brandon said i indict these denominations and many of the independents when you behave like a denomination with pastors controlling like a king and king and kingdom building and no miracles no moving of the spirit binding them down to slavery even let me let me just say even making brother branham you're king he let me tell you he's not god he's not the holy ghost he's not to be your king god didn't send brother branham to be the head of a personality cult amen god don't want his son joseph branham to be a person not that he called the leader either but that's what they made him just as it did with lee vale and joseph coleman and a myriad of others and i could keep calling names because there's big sauls and little sauls with big kingdoms and little kingdoms nicolette and spirits the spirit of denomination as paul brother branham said paul knew that it would implement a way of worship that excluded the people from any part of a holy spirit ministry and even right today among those who claim to be free and full of the spirit there's not too much freedom in the laity and the best we can see is a few preachers with inspired preaching while the flop just sits there and tries to absorb it this is far cry from paul who said all came together and all had the leading of the spirit and all participated in spiritual worship but what happened the people got caught up we want a king we want a man that we could say about him this is our guide we follow this we're in this movement this is our we're in this group we we got the corner on the market here and you know we're the ones going in the in the rapture we we're the we're the only ones with the truth son's a kish now sons of kisha reputed among men many times honorable man so all of us he suited the people just right he was tall noble good-looking you know statue of a man head and shoulder above all the rest of them in the israel he could even listen he could even sometimes get anointed and preach a good sermon but he wasn't called of god to do it he was of the tribe of benjamin he never was god's choice he was the people's choice people aren't satisfied with god placing in his church then to be governed by the holy spirit and controlled by him they want somebody to tell them what to do they want some man some denomination some certain people to govern the church that they're not able to throw themselves completely into god's hand to be spiritual to be led by the holy ghost they and i'm quoting brother branham they want somebody to do their religion for them somebody that i tell them just how to do it and all about it that's what people want today they want somebody to do their religion for them well you know we give brother tim our tithes let him do the studying let him do the praying we you know we we make sure you know that he doesn't have to work out in secular work he can devote himself so why do i need to pray what do i need to be a spiritual man how come how come i need to listen to the tapes how come i got a witness to people out of my job and wherever you know we pay the preacher to do that you see god sent on the day of pentecost the holy ghost to rule in men's hearts and rule in their lives it was never meant for man to rule over man amen you said brother tim you mean to tell me that a pastor is not to lead his church oh yeah he is he is to lead the church by feeding them the word he's not to be king nor to claim claim to be the husband of the church and especially not the husband of individuals in the church amen but man wants to rule and that man loves to be ruled he didn't want to have god to rule him but still you see they chose a great man but it still wasn't god's way of doing him god wanted his faithful old prophet to to direct him and speak his words to them and remember in this today in the church age that we live in he said i think i believe this with all my heart we've gone exactly vice versa from what god ordained us to do the last words of our savior was mark 16 go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they will speak with new tongues and if they should take a serpent or drink deadly things it will not hurt them they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover and there's not a man there's no son of kiss no other one else can produce that outside of the leadership of the holy spirit our churches have gone so corruptive on the basis we're choosing our shepherds to lead us we've gone to the seminaries we've selected men with great intellectual giants men who are brilliant in their minds men who have scholarships or great mixers among the people great men in their neighborhood which i have nothing to say against men who are kind in their ways of walk careful in their ways of life how they conduct themselves among other men and among people great men in their fields which i do not speak evil of god forbid that my spirit would ever be that evil but still it isn't what god called chose for us it's the leadership of the holy spirit christ in the heart of man many of those intellectual men stand in our pulpit and they deny the real existence of the holy ghost many of them deny the existence of divine healing to the power of the spirit i'm ashamed to say we're not just talking about baptist methods presbyterian we're talking about message churches now a man sends a kiss of god in the pulpit chosen by men and and they've got they've done good things they can do great print works they can build churches they can they they can organize great movements and things like that you know even as i said be said to put to saul you will also prophesy and many of them can become great mighty preachers and can preach like archangels but still it isn't god's will god was to be their king and brother sister you let the holy spirit lead you amen he sent the holy spirit but he said god sent the holy spirit and he's to be our guide he's to be our leader but when they see the holy spirit moving they get scared of it it's a stranger to them because they've never been taught in that line they're taught just a certain church what it believes and go through life calling themselves christians and going with the things of the world and and when they die they say well my faith saves me said i said to a man one time sir don't the lord ever condemn you for that smoking say oh no no no wait a minute you think oh this is baptist methodist i know of trustees and officials in churches that are smokers message churches he said oh oh no he said i've seen you drink myself but he said look here preacher i want to tell you something i visited another man in the room he said my face saves me i said but mister let me tell you something now faith without works is dead no holy spirit don't live a life like that and i said you may be disappointed i said now the faith is all right but the works don't follow that faith your faith is no good and when you die remember it doesn't change your spirit it only changes your dwelling place and whatever type of sphere you go in you that's a place it will it will um it'll that's a place it will go to and sin can never enter heaven you say well i confess mine every night that's where people are i'm just in the flesh you know i've got this flesh and i can't help it this this whole flesh and besides that you know i confess my sins every night we've got a prayer book and when we go to church we confess all our sins and turn it right back around he said and do them again turn right back the next day and say god forgive me for drinking forgive me for committing adultery forgive me for lying forgive me for stealing and turn right back around do the same thing forgive me for getting drunk last week i didn't mean to drink that much and turn right back around and drink again well that shows something hasn't changed inside you're trying to paint the outside kind of whitewash it but what needs done is put on the blood of jesus christ and wash white instead of white wasps amen now this is what brother branham said many people want him as savior to keep them from going to hell but they don't want to be the lord of their lives to be the governor to be the ruler they don't want him meddling in their private business well you know with israel they get a message i don't remember now was it from the amorites who sends out and said well i tell you what we're going to do we're going to put out the right eye of every one of god's people we're going to go you're going to serve us and we're going to put out every one of your right eyes and brother brethren said that's the one that's spiritual if he can put the spiritual side out of your eye where you see the natural and not the spiritual things he's got your whip right there as long as you can have churches and big places and find intellectual dressed people and some more as long as your eye looks like that and you don't see the don't see the spirit inside the enemy's got you under control because you don't know where you're going and i'll tell you that's the problem today because of a lack of an old-fashioned sin killing backwoods religion sin killing revival amen bible holy ghost back in the church you've got a lot of people with a right eye out they don't have a spiritual eye all they can see is natural things well god's blessing me here and god's blessed me there and god gave us this beautiful church and we got a great ministry but it's got to be something that brings the power of god back in the church amen the spirit of god moving on the audience people filled with the holy ghost and remember the first time not the second time but the first time that saul reached up and decided he was going to offer the sacrifice are you with me and he moves on out of his position out of this place come on and the first time that he got you know that the people started being led by man instead of god the holy ghost goes right away from you and god left saul right there amen and you know what you know they become just like a bunch of confused people now they're living a defeated life they're still perpetuating the church ages just start going down into failure brother branham liking it to like an old gander that led a bunch of geese out of canada he wound up over there in england somewhere you know and they they were they've never been able to come back they'll just circle around and around and honk and honk and it comes time to to go back to their lands and that nobody knows where to go and he said it puts me in mind of some of these former marbs these formal cold formal morgues i hope that don't describe your church amen get so far back away from god you don't know how to get back you you can't come back by creeds you've got to have inspiration to lead your brother and that inspiration comes by the holy ghost let of the spirit sons of daughters of god are led by the spirit of god they love the spirit they don't try to say no wait a minute my church don't say amen that describes a lot of message churches now my church they never raise their hands they're very quiet why we'd give our pastor chills and fever if somebody hollered amen well brother brandon said you ought to chill him up every once in a while amen he said what we need today is a good old heartfelt religion let me tell you something if a baby's born the baby don't cry if it don't whine but don't open his little mouth and say a thing nothing happened you know what's the matter with the baby he's born dead he's i think we got too many still births today in the church oh you say brother tim that was back in the 50s brother branham was preaching that after the seals in the tree and the easter seal brother madam uses the same analogy he said we got too many stillborn babies in the church he said why he said you have one born like that he said what do you do a good doctor he'll take and spat him on the rear like that until he gets him screaming out he called that a good gospel protoplasm stimulation amen that's what he call it amen a good paddling once a while amen to where sin is preached so hard against and people realize i need jesus and their conviction in the house of god and people weep their way to calvary we're talking about old-time religion now we don't want it no more well the next thing he says you know he sends out a proclamation and he says follow me whoever don't follow me and samuel well you heard brother branham say that well you see they want to still identify with the true prophet of god but but saul did it to get them to follow him so therefore using a few select quotes from a true prophet they deny anointed preachers they deny gifts of the spirit they deny genuine experiences they deny speaking in tongues well everybody who speaks with tongues aren't saved well it's true some of them are just sounding brass and tinkling symbols amen but some are true and there is a genuine holy ghost speaking in tongues it's always supposed to be in the church that's from standing in the gap amen brother branham which uh brother branham tells us that but but let me just tell you don't just go on one side of this say well everybody that you know you know we got to have love brother tim you know we'd rather have love and because you could speak in tongues like men and angels yeah but you could also know all the mysteries you could also know all the mysteries come and preach the other side of it too so if you want to preach against speaking in tongues preach against some mysteries too come on amen i believe that we ought to have the mysteries but you can know all the mysteries and still lack the love of god that's his basic nature so they said let all the people follow me and samuel see he used the prophet's reputation to deceive the people do you know to go around and can you imagine using the prophet's own words to try to make him support two gods two lords two jehovah's two jesus using the prophet's own word to try to make him say the seven thunders are the seven virtues that's what sons of kiss do amen that's that's what they do but then when it comes around to genuine experience they don't want nobody to have that no sir you know the evidence the holy ghost is receiving what i preach and the first thing you know he's kicking christ is kicked out of the church the king is rejected now i'm going over time right now and i know you've been hearing all day and this you're tired but i preached this morning you listened you know john watson wesley he was preaching divine healing you know and now now today the methodist church denies it here's a here's a page from john wesley's diary in the late 1700s sunday morning may the 5th i preached and said saint ann's was asked not to come back again sunday p.m on may the 5th i preached to saint john's and deacon said get out and stay out sunday evening or sunday morning on may the 12th i preached the saint jews can't go back there either sunday p.m may the 12th the priest at saint george's and was kicked out again sunday am may the 19th and preached it saint somebody else's and the deacons called a special meeting and said i couldn't return sunday p.m i preached on the street and i got kicked off the street sunday 8 a.m may the 26th i preached in a matter and chased out of the matter as the bull was turned loose during the service sunday a.m june the second i preached on the edge of town i was kicked off the highway 70 p.m june the 2nd the afternoon service i preached in the pastor 10 000 people came to hear me somebody's going to hear the word and a real gospel preacher ain't going to give up amen he's going to keep preaching the word no matter how many times the king is rejected now brother branham talked about billy graham he calls him by name he said he's the son of kish you see he was never called of god he was never out of the right tribe he was educated head and shoulder above all others a fine man a challenger of evangelism and a child challenged him and when the challenged him and said if your god is god let him heal the sick like he said he would do and the son of kiss with the rest of the army quaking himself left the country defeated amen it's a disgrace our god is god one of the sons of kiss head and shoulders above all the other evangelists called by muhammad and the other day challenged to the word of god trembled in his shoes and left the ground what's the matter it's something besides theology it has to bring the supernatural power of god and do it he knew nothing about it same as in the days of saul and i wonder today even ain't the same we got good churches we got lots of people and big crowds and lots of money and you know we we can we can uh evangelize and we can send books out and we can build churches but i say where's the power of god where is divine healing amen where is salvation for the soul where is the power pouring out of the holy ghost where is it that the king is king lord of lord and king of kings his word remains supreme but all in this time while saul was building his army while saul was trying to establish his kingship when he was trying to get ready to pass it on down to his sons and he was grooming his sons we're going to be the king over israel and out of our lineage and we'll have an intellectual kingdom that i'll be greater than the others while all of that is going on i want you to know what happened an evil spirit from the presence of god came on the man god sent an evil spirit because if the you won't let the holy spirit lead he'll send an evil spirit to lead you come on amen and when we see the same thing an evil spirit that'll say days of miracles are passed an evil spirit that says well you know we just believe the message and we're we got the holy ghost an evil spirit scoffers in the last days souls rising up somebody with me amen led by an evil spirit that would say evil about the movement of the holy ghost that will condemn a youth camp like ours said well i'll tell you it's changed brother tim i'll tell you how it started it started out amen in our meeting there at clara springs louisiana let me tell you how it started out it started out with the move of the holy ghost donnie reagan preaching in the pulpit and he's preaching the word and the power of god hit young people and the thousands were full and they wept their way to calvary and they shouted and they danced up and down the aisles and their lives were changed and many of the men and women are still change lives today wasn't no intellectual meeting we're not going to have an intellectual meeting and i'll tell you if that's what you want and that's what you call insane and sensible keep your kids home we're going to have the holy ghost move we're going to have the king we're going to have the power of god we're going to have the holy ghost poured out we're going to see young people transformed by the power of god we're not going to teach psychology we're going to teach them some neology where they cut down and meet god and their lives were changed and not reformed but transformed but all while this were happening there was a little david out there with the sheep unnoticed his daddy didn't even recognize him he's just out there among the sheep but while he was out there among the sheep a lion of a cancer come on hallelujah a lion of a cancer came but you see little david was not assault he had been anointed he oh as he was singing it the anointing was on his songs the lord is my shepherd i shall not want i will not fear the arrows by day or the arrows by night i i will not fear even though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i'll fear no evil here comes roar of a cancer comes get one of his flock amen david didn't run and hide like saul amen he wasn't no coward he said god sent me and there ain't no devil going to take no child of god out on my watch amen the prayer of faith shall save the second god shall raise them up amen hallelujah a little david has said when the enemy comes in tasked one of our young people and pull them down in pornography and sin we're not gonna let that happen on our watch hallelujah there's gonna be a praying church there's gonna be a people with a slingshot of faith there's going to be a people that knows how to put the name of jesus in their slang and let it go hallelujah hallelujah in the middle of all this god's bringing forth the king and i'll tell you in the midst of laodicea in the midst of the confusion god's bringing forth the king the lord of lords the king of kings leading them by still waters and green pastures mindful of father's sheep and he knows the power of god to deliver them god's still got david somewhere he got men of god somewhere oh i'm thankful i know many of them are many a little david's that are out there they may be overlooked but they're true shepherds that feeds them jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and if the enemy comes and grabs one of them he knows the power of god there's one thing i'll tell you i may not know the philosophy i may not know psychology i don't care one bit about all of the man's ideas but there's one thing i know when the enemy come in after one of our sheep we took the slingshot of faith against it and we'll do it again and again and bring them safely back to health again we need the leadership of the holy ghost and i just want to warn every son of kiss that is out there throwing your spears throwing your javelins at the anointing of god you're doing this because you received an evil spirit instead of the holy spirit because when a man rejects the leadership of the holy spirit god gave him an evil spirit to lead him so when a man rejects the leading of the holy spirit a person rejects the leading of the holy spirit you've got a devil on you and i just want to bear witness if you hear one lashing out and dancing in the spirit or this emotion calling it pentecostalism i will tell you why they are throwing the spears because they have taken on an evil spirit and become a part of the scoffers in the last day instead of a part of the shout brother branham said this notice that when his presence is near certainly it brings emotion anything without emotion is dead and any religion that hasn't got some emotion to it you better bury it is dead it brings emotion everywhere jesus is there's a lot of noise where god is it makes a lot of noise i don't know why it is but to do but anything without noise without emotion is dead that scientific is your religion and got a little emotion to it you better bury it because it's certainly dead god hates a powerless religion it's got to have power it's a power to save a man from sin and we've seen it i could call him by name those that were out in horrible sins and trespasses amen but it's a power to save from sins it's a power to do signs and wonders we've seen epilepsy cast out amen we've seen demons have to flee we've in tormented spirits have to leave amen we've seen cancers go we've seen eyes be healed we've seen thy beat is healed we've seen miracles we've seen signs because we serve a living god because god wants to perform god wants to show himself alive god wants divine healing among his people but yet we tell those days pass it's not the season for it i got a video of a man who played who is a good man he's a great son of kiss saying you know well it's just not the seal of season for divine healing and we get a miracle hope for one now and then but just think the season for it well when's it going to be when did god quit the healing business i'll tell you when same time you quit the saving business if you don't save you don't heal salvation on the body is the same as salvation on the soul once it's the soul around the others the body realm amen so there's going to be salvation on the soul there has to be salvation for the body amen you see but it comes down to the point well we don't want that no more we want something more reformed is he sane and sensible and you know just really down pat and you know we're teaching our people to dress the finest and god will bless your finances and we come in there and you know we're we're we're going but they don't want an upper room experience and they want to teach sons of kiss will teach they'll teach that you receive the holy ghost like mary did when she concede after the message of the angel she got it without sensation and that's the way we get the holy ghost today where'd you get that lie of the devil you don't have a quote for it the very things that the prophet said he said if you have if you will ever get to heaven you'll get to heaven just like mary did with the 120 in the upper room acting the same way they did getting the holy ghost the same way they did staggering and speaking in other towns and dancing in the spirit and acting like a fanatic [Applause] son's a kiss if you ever get the holy ghost your couple run over you ever get full of the holy ghost should be like a drunk man some of you can you imagine can you imagine that the king has been rejected they don't want him we're no longer talking about baptist methodist presbyterian we're talking about church members don't want the king i want to be one of the lineage that brings back the king amen amen i'm part of a group of people that still believes he's the same yesterday today and forever i'm a people believes that knows that he's god i'm a people that knows he's the same yesterday today and forever i know they know his power they felt his power they've experienced him and they want others to experience it they're going to bring forth the king quicken to life now brother branham preaches the rejected king and then he breaks into his vision because in bringing forth the king is going to bring us into the kingdom and i went one breath away and there they were white robed beautiful no yesterdays are tomorrow everyone perfect one great big joy and all filled with perfect love the holy ghost right here on the edge of the king being rejected is the kingdom coming let's welcome the king let's prepare our hearts for the king the king is coming the king is coming amen he's coming to be lord over somebody's life let him be lord of mine he's going to be king over a church let him be the king over this church no bishops no popes amen no man made leadership no man called preachers god bless you brother edic over there in south

lord we'll be worshiping you as we take the communion [Music] lord a little couple over in alabama they don't have a church to go to the elderly up in years while we're here tonight they've said we're preparing the bread we're going to take it when you take it brother tim [Music] lord you see those shut-ins there the longing of their heart will you meet with them lord as they take the communion to around the world lord wherever your people are bring them into that communion with you i ask it in the name of jesus do the work of grace and hearts and lives lord if there's sin in our lives forgive us may we not be like that man to just say i repent of my sins only to go back again but let us leave them behind serve the living god with all our hearts in jesus name [Music] amen amen now listen very carefully some of you have never taken communion with us maybe this is the first time in our communion service we don't believe in a closed communion it's for all believers so you're welcome to come to the table the lord tonight but your heart should be right with god and you should have received of his precious gift of his spirit and you can commune with him what you're doing tonight is taking the bread and you're testifying i'm part of a body a loaf you're taking of the wine and you're saying you're proclaiming before the audience from before god i have drunk of the wine the life from the grapevine was squeezed out for me and his life has been poured out i'm taking now that life by symbolic i'm showing i have taken that life into me and i am taking this anew i am coming down to the day of the lord to proclaim before this congregation my sins are under the blood and i am serving the lord and i'm part of this loaf and i take part of this loaf to become a part of me because i'm a part of that body i'm drinking of this wine because it's symbolic of the holy spirit and i have drank of it but i asked oh god in the filling of it make me realize i'm more than ever part of this word part of this body and i more than ever want to drink of that cup lord till i'm so drunk on it to the world and all this is there just fades away amen till i i go in from this day on with christ as the king of my life proclaiming the world he's the same yesterday today and forever now what we're going to do is i'm going to read the scripture i'm going to bless pray over the bread and the wine we will be forming a couple of lines the deacons will come by the row they will call your row you will walk down here whichever side the building you're i believe we come from from this way and you meet here we have we have the the trays we have the the bread is all from one loaf [Music] it was made with holy ghost hands is not some store-bought something we have the wine that is the kosher wine for passover represents the god the blood of jesus christ it's not grape juice and light bread it's not someone's sanctified or unholy thing we're going to dedicate it to god and you dedicate yourself as you take it now as you take it you will walk right down toward those devil doors to the right hand side will be the men over in this hall there's chairs set up with basins for you to wash one another's feet over here the ladies will do it now i know there's sometimes there's elderly in the handicapped and you can't get down and wash feet we understand god understands don't try to make this a law we're under grace god knows your heart he knows you would be right down there doing it if you could but i pray tonight that you'll realize there's healing in the cup and in the communion and as you take it that you'll claim your healing for your body or even for your wounded spirit or healing wherever it's needed now i'm going to go down now and i'm going to read the scripture in a moment we'll put on a different type of music let the musicians take a part in this service in fact i'm going to dismiss them now i'm going to ask the brothers if they'll come down to me right now as we come to the table of the lord and as we we bring this i'm going to read the scripture to you and then i'm going to let you have your seats first corinthians 11 23 for i received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take heed this is my body which is broken for you it's due in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup which he had sept say in this cup is the new testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you just show the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord and worthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body not realizing we're not here playing church this is serious business for this cause many are sick and weakly among us are weak and sickly among us and some are dead for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged for when we are judged we are chastened to the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat carry one for another god bless you you can have your seats if you were taking just turn on this soft music just for a moment i'm just going to prepare the table of the lord i know [Music] there's a lot of different questions a lot of different ideas brother branham used the tray when his church was small he used the cup but this all came from one vessel it represents a multi a multi-membered body you can even see on the tape where brother branham used to tray i realize that some people get very very legalistic they say we must all drink out of one cup to be doing this scripturally but if that's so then we must all wash in one foot washing pan and use one towel for everybody here this is not about legalism this is about a sacred service to the lord now we're going to pray father i want to thank you for this that represents your breath your body and your blood i want you to thank you lord for the blood of christ that forgives us of all sins and that our sins are under the blood i want to thank you lord for this wine and this bread i want you to tonight lord to come in that marvelous way and reveal yourself personally to each one and as they take the communion for them to resolve in their heart this day starts a new communion with you a new fellowship a greater love than i've ever had before that you be king of my life in jesus name amen and like i said the deacons will be calling first the musicians because they'll be coming back for the for the service what you will do is when you come from foot washing you come right back into the auditorium together for the dismissal so it works just really perfectly as we come you come expecting the lord to meet you here as you fulfill his word okay [Music] everyone tarry one for the other just pray as you're in your seat just prepare your heart for this moment in time [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] do [Music] [Music] do [Music] do [Music] do [Music] [Music] do do
