[17:46] prayer. Father, we love you so much and
[17:48] we thank you for your grace, Lord. We
[17:51] thank you for your mercy in our lives,
[17:53] Lord. And Lord, as we look around and
[17:55] see the things that you're doing,
[17:57] Father, Lord, the great and mighty works
[18:00] that we're laying again before your
[18:01] throne and saying, "Come, Jesus, come."
[18:04] Lord, move upon lives this evening.
[18:07] Father, you see the needs that are
[18:08] represented tonight. Those that are sick
[18:11] and body, Lord, this need Sister Phyllis
[18:13] turned in for the pain in her leg.
[18:15] Lord, the different ones, Father, that
[18:17] would love to be here tonight and are
[18:19] unable, Lord. Those that have strayed
[18:22] away, I pray that you'll bring them back
[18:23] to you, Father. Lord, those that are
[18:26] sick and body that are, Lord, suffering
[18:29] these terrible conditions, cancer, Lord,
[18:31] and Lord, chronic pains and debilitating
[18:35] diseases, Father, none of them are
[18:37] anything to you, dear God. And we put
[18:39] them back into your hands, Lord. Lord,
[18:41] we thank you that you came and you paid
[18:43] the price on Calvary for each one, Lord.
[18:46] Lord, for healing, for deliverance,
[18:48] Lord, for life, for salvation, for the
[18:52] Holy Ghost, we give it all to you,
[18:54] Father. Lord, every need supply
[18:56] abundantly. We pray, Lord, I ask that
[18:59] each one that's lifting their hands to
[19:01] you, Father.
[19:03] Lord, that they'll ask big things of you
[19:05] tonight, Lord, and that you'll repay
[19:06] even bigger than they could imagine.
[19:10] Lord, we look to you, Father.
[19:14] Where else could we go?
[19:17] We thank you for your words of eternal
[19:19] life. Lord, we thank you for this
[19:20] opportunity we have. Pray you'll bless
[19:23] the ministry of the word tonight. Lord,

[19:33] to travel tomorrow. Lord, touch each
[19:36] one. Lord, we pray. Lord, have a mighty
[19:40] move across your bride. We ask, Father,
[19:43] each one that's gathering tonight, I
[19:45] pray it won't just be out of a
[19:46] tradition, Lord, but a yearning and a
[19:49] desire in each one's heart, Lord. It
[19:51] says, "I've got to have more of you."
[19:54] Lord, that's our desire tonight. We love
[19:56] you. We thank you for the opportunity we
[19:58] have, Lord. We give ourselves to you in
[20:02] Jesus name.

[25:23] light. And no more in darkness,
[25:28] no more in night. Oh, now I'm so happy.
[25:34] No sorrow.
[25:37] Oh, praise the Lord. Yes, I saw the
[25:42] light. I wonder so aimless. Life filled
[25:48] with sin.
[25:50] I wouldn't let my dear Savior in. Oh,
[25:56] that Jesus came like a stranger in the
[26:01] night. Oh, praise the Lord. Yes, I saw
[26:07] the light.
[26:09] I saw the light. Oh, I saw the light and
[26:16] no more in darkness
[26:19] no more.
[26:21] Oh, now I am happy. No sorrow.
[26:28] Oh, praise the Lord. Oh, I saw the light
[26:34] and I was a fool to walk through and
[26:39] stray. Brother Sam, if you could bring
[26:42] your special. Oh, and Pharaoh's the way.
[26:48] Now I have traded the wrong for the
[26:52] right. Oh, praise the Lord. Yes, I saw
[26:58] the light.
[27:00] I saw the light. Oh, I saw the light.
[27:06] And no more in darkness.
[27:10] No more in.
[27:13] Now I'm so happy. Sorrow.
[27:19] Oh, praise the Lord.
[27:22] I one more time.
[27:26] I saw the light. Oh, I saw the light.
[27:32] No more in darkness.
[27:35] No more.
[27:38] Oh, now I'm so happy. No sorrow is. Oh,
[27:44] praise the Lord.
[27:48] I saw the light. Let's just give the
[27:50] Lord a hand of praise tonight as you
[27:52] take your seat. Amen.
[28:16] A woman in the Bible days, her last meal
[28:22] almost gone.
[28:25] God sent Elijah
[28:29] to make his word known.
[28:34] He said, "Loman, don't you worry.
[28:39] For God sent me today."
[28:43] And before he even ask him,
[28:48] help was on the way.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; Just hold on a little longer.
[28:59] Help is on the way.
[29:04] A brighter day is coming
[29:08] for those who believe and pray.
[29:13] Help one help tomorrow.
[29:18] If you give up today, just hold it on a
[29:24] little longer.
[29:27] Help is on the way.
[29:34] Troubles of this life come by and
[29:38] burdens
[29:40] get you down.
[29:43] You think no one is listening.
[29:48] You think no one's around.
[29:52] Just remember what his word says.
[29:57] Trust him and obey.
[30:01] Keep your eyes towards the heavens.
[30:06] Help is on the way.
[30:12] Just hold on a little longer.
[30:18] Help is on the way.
[30:23] Brighter days coming.
[30:27] And those who believe and pray,
[30:32] help won't help tomorrow.
[30:36] If you give up today,
[30:40] just hold on a little longer.
[30:46] Help is on the way.
[30:52] Just hold on a little longer.
[30:58] Help is on the way.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; A brighter day is coming
[31:07] for those who believe and pray.
[31:12] Help all help tomorrow.
[31:16] If you give up today,
[31:20] just hold on a little longer.
[31:26] Help is on the way.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; Help on help tomorrow.
[31:38] If you give up today,
[31:41] just hold on a little longer.
[31:47] Help is on the way.
[32:08] Hallelujah. Do you believe that?
[32:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:14] He's got it all
[32:18] in control.
[32:22] Amen. and you believe help is on the
[32:24] way. He's got it all
[32:26] in control.
[32:29] Can you just hold on a little longer? He
[32:31] put that reassur
[32:36] way down in my soul.
[32:43] He's got it all in control.
[32:52] He's got it all in control.
[33:01] He's got it all in control.
[33:09] And he put that reassur
[33:14] way down in my soul.
[33:21] He's got it all
[33:24] in control. You just put your needs in
[33:26] his hands. Why don't we just sing that
[33:28] one that says, "I put my love ones in
[33:33] his hands.
[33:38] I put my love ones in his hand.
[33:46] So every road they walk down,
[33:50] I'm sure it's in his way.
[33:56] Oh,
[33:58] I put my love ones in his. My father
[34:03] knows what I need. Say,
[34:06] my father knows what I need.
[34:15] My father knows what I need.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, he knows what's best for me.
[34:35] My father knows.
[34:41] How could you explain?
[34:50] Oh, how could you describe
[34:58] a love that goes for me?
[35:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, just think about it. runs as steep.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is right.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[35:16] you know all our hopes
[35:23] and you know all our fears.
[35:32] And words cannot express the love
[35:38] we feel.
[35:40] But we long for you to hear.
[35:47] Oh, and listen to our hearts.
[35:55] Oh, hear our spirit sing.
[36:04] Oh, a song of praise that flows.
[36:11] Yes. From those you have redeemed.
[36:19] And we will use the words we know.
[36:25] Oh, to tell you one.
[36:29] and awesome
[36:31] God you are
[36:35] when words are not enough
[36:39] to tell you of our love.
[36:43] Oh listen to all. Amen. If words could
[36:47] fall like rain. Let's stand and sing it
[36:49] now. Amen. If words could fall like
[36:53] rain.
[36:57] Yes. from these lips of mine.
[37:05] Oh, and if I had a thousand years,
[37:12] I would still run out of time.
[37:20] So if you listen to my heart,
[37:27] Lord,
[37:28] every me.
[37:32] Oh, can you thank him tonight? Say, I
[37:35] thank you for the life, Lord. I thank
[37:39] you for the truth.
[37:42] Yes, I thank you.
[37:46] Oh, listen Lord.
[37:49] Won't you listen to my heart?
[37:56] Oh, hear our spirit sing.
[38:03] Oh, a song of praise and voice.
[38:10] Yes. for those you have redeemed.
[38:18] And we will use the words we know
[38:24] to tell you what an awesome
[38:29] God you are.
[38:33] Words are not there
[38:37] to tell you.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:49] Let's just go to him in prayer. Father,
[38:51] come to you tonight, Lord. Just once
[38:53] again asking you to come and take
[38:56] control, Lord, of our lives, our body,
[38:58] our words, our thoughts, Lord.
[39:02] Lord, we just ask sometimes we don't
[39:04] have the words to speak. We don't have
[39:06] the words to say. And Lord, our heart,
[39:09] Lord, wants to say how much we love you
[39:10] and appreciate you. And thank you for
[39:13] all the things you have done for us,
[39:15] Lord. We're so thankful.
[39:18] So thankful for the call of God in our
[39:20] lives and the grace of God and things
[39:23] you've done for us so many times, Lord,
[39:25] and stepped in, Lord, when we would have
[39:27] made a mistake or we would have
[39:29] destroyed ourselves. but your mercy and
[39:31] grace stepped in. We're so thankful for
[39:33] that. We just ask Lord you'll just come
[39:37] this evening and touch our hearts by
[39:39] your grace in Jesus name. Amen.
[39:43] Amen. Turn to James chapter 2 if you
[39:46] would
[39:48] verse 14.
[39:55] It's good to be in the house of the
[39:56] Lord.
[40:00] says, "What do it profit my brethren,
[40:03] though a man say he hath faith and have
[40:06] not works? Can faith save him? If a
[40:10] brother or sister be naked and destitute
[40:13] of daily food, and one of you say unto
[40:15] them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and
[40:18] filled." Notwithstanding you give them
[40:21] not those things which are needful to
[40:23] the body, what doth it profit? Even so
[40:27] faith if it hath not works is dead being
[40:29] alone. Yay man said a man may say thou
[40:33] hast faith and I have works. Show me thy
[40:36] faith without works and I will show thee
[40:38] my faith by my works. Thou believest
[40:41] that there is one God. Thou does well.
[40:45] The devils also believe and tremble. But
[40:47] wilt thou know, vain man, that faith
[40:50] without works is dead? Was not Abraham
[40:53] our father justified by works when he
[40:55] had offered Isaac his son upon the
[40:57] altar? Seeest thou hath seeest thou hath
[41:01] how faith wrought with his works and by
[41:04] works has faith made perfect. And the
[41:07] scripture was fulfilled which saith
[41:09] Abraham believed God and it was imputed
[41:11] unto him for righteousness and he was
[41:14] called the friend of God. You see then
[41:16] how that by works a man is justified and
[41:19] not by faith only. Likewise also was not
[41:22] Rahab the harlot justified by works when
[41:26] she had received the messengers and has
[41:28] sent them out another way. For as the
[41:31] body without the spirit is dead, so
[41:34] faith without works is dead also. Amen.
[41:38] We let you be seated.
[41:46] Brandon would speak it speak about this
[41:49] like this. He said, "Abraham believed
[41:51] God." That's what God saw him in him
[41:54] that he really believed. But then he
[41:57] went to acting as though it was already
[42:00] done and that's what man saw in him. I
[42:04] want to speak on faith and action. He
[42:06] said that's the same it is with us
[42:08] because our works express what faith we
[42:11] really have. But if we're afraid to act
[42:14] on what we believe, then we really don't
[42:17] believe it.
[42:18] Amen. Abraham's works was expressed his
[42:21] faith. It expressed his faith he had in
[42:23] God's promise. Now remember, Abraham was
[42:26] maybe a hundred years old. Sarah was 90
[42:28] years old. And they were well stricken
[42:30] in age, way past childbearing, been
[42:33] many, many years. And they had lived
[42:34] together as husband and wife since they
[42:36] were young and no children. But yet God
[42:38] told him when he was 75 years old and
[42:41] Sarah was 65, you're going to have a
[42:43] baby. And he believed God's promise. He
[42:45] believed it. But he also did something.
[42:48] He made ready for every everything ready
[42:51] for this baby. See, that's what God saw.
[42:54] He saw that he believed, but man saw
[42:56] what he did to express what he believed.
[42:59] That's the same thing that works tonight
[43:01] the same way it is with us. Now, there's
[43:04] many that think that Paul and James was
[43:06] at war with each other on on works. But
[43:09] actually, it actually paints a full
[43:11] picture because Paul speaks about it
[43:13] Romans Romans chapter 3 and verse 28. He
[43:16] says, "A person is justified by faith
[43:19] apart from works of the law." In other
[43:21] words, another one placed in Ephesians
[43:22] 2, he says, "By grace you have been
[43:25] saved through faith, not by works." Paul
[43:28] is actually saying that people cannot
[43:30] earn salvation.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. By obeying a law or a certain
[43:35] circumcision or a ritual or some moral
[43:37] effort. But he's actually confronting
[43:40] religious legalism and you know and
[43:43] people and and the problem he's
[43:45] addressing that people are trying to
[43:47] earn salvation trying to earn it and
[43:50] make it a thing of works a performance.
[43:52] Listen, we do not have a
[43:54] performancebased salvation. I'm so
[43:56] thankful for that. Amen. Our salvation
[43:58] is not performance-based, but it's by
[44:01] accepting the grace of God that he has
[44:03] given to us in our lives. And therefore
[44:05] we are made righteous when with God by
[44:08] trusting in what he's already done. Not
[44:11] by performance of rules, not by
[44:13] performance of regulations. But Paul
[44:15] also is saying that true faith will also
[44:18] lead to obedience. He does not leave
[44:20] that out. But he goes on in the same
[44:22] chapter in Ephesians 2, he speaks about
[44:24] it. He says we're created in Christ
[44:26] Jesus for good works. He just said that
[44:29] we're not saved by works, but he said we
[44:31] are created in Christ Jesus for good
[44:34] works. And so Paul does not reject good
[44:37] works. He rejects trusting good works to
[44:40] save you.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. He rejects that trusting that is
[44:44] going to save you. So faith by itself,
[44:46] as James said, is if it does not have
[44:49] works, it is dead. James is correcting
[44:52] people who claim to have faith but show
[44:54] no changed life.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. They claim to have the Holy Ghost,
[44:59] but they don't show anything's ever
[45:01] changed.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; He's speaking about an empty belief. He
[45:04] said the devils also believe and
[45:06] tremble. Amen. Amen. People claiming
[45:08] faith, but having no evidence that their
[45:11] faith is true or their faith is genuine.
[45:14] It's meaning of works is a is actually a
[45:17] visible action that demonstrates you
[45:20] have genuine faith. Amen. Real faith
[45:23] always produces results or produces a
[45:26] fruit. Amen. James is not saying works
[45:29] earn salvation. He's saying that faith
[45:32] that he's saying that faith that never
[45:34] produces action is not real faith at
[45:37] all. Amen. So Paul speaks then again of
[45:40] justified by faith apart from works.
[45:43] James comes around and he says a person
[45:46] is justified by works and not by faith
[45:48] alone. you know, they're actually using
[45:50] them justified in a different manner.
[45:52] Paul again is how a sinner is declared
[45:56] righteous to God. Amen. How God sees him
[45:59] and how how he's declared righteous
[46:01] before God. And James is coming around
[46:03] speaking about how faith is shown to be
[46:06] genuine before others in your life.
[46:09] Amen. So Paul is talking about the root
[46:12] of salvation. James is talking about the
[46:15] fruit of salvation. Amen. So Paul again
[46:18] is as he speaks about Abraham was
[46:20] counted righteous when he believed God,
[46:22] but he also had an action to prove what
[46:26] he really believed.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. So James comes back around again.
[46:30] I know we're going back and forth, but
[46:31] bear with me for a moment. Abraham's
[46:33] faith was proven genuine when he offered
[46:36] up Isaac.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. He could have said, "I believed
[46:39] all he want to. I believe is I believe."
[46:41] But if he would not have taken those
[46:42] steps or that action, it would not it
[46:44] would have showed he truly did not
[46:46] believe. Amen. Amen. So there's
[46:48] different moments in Abraham's life.
[46:50] There's a faith that saved him, but
[46:52] there's works that proved his faith was
[46:55] real. Amen. We We are saved by faith
[46:58] alone. But I want you to catch this. We
[47:00] are saved by faith alone.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; We are saved by faith alone. But the
[47:05] faith that saves us is never alone.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on now. We're saved by
[47:12] faith alone, but the faith that saves us
[47:15] is never alone. There's an action to it.
[47:18] There's something that takes place.
[47:20] Amen. There's an evidence to it. It's
[47:22] not just I believe. Amen. It's have you
[47:25] received the Holy Ghost since you
[47:26] believed.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; There's an there's an evidence. This is
[47:29] where Jesus would even come and he would
[47:31] speak about his works. He said, "If I do
[47:33] not the works of my father, believe me
[47:36] not. But if I do, though you believe not
[47:38] me, believe the works, for you may know
[47:41] and believe that the father is in me and
[47:43] I in him. In another place he said,
[47:45] answering answering them that said in
[47:48] him, Abraham is our father. Jesus said
[47:50] unto them, if you are Abraham's
[47:52] children, you would do the works of
[47:54] Abraham.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. You would have the same actions.
[47:57] You wouldn't just say, I believe, but
[47:59] there would be something inside of you
[48:00] to respond. There would be something
[48:02] inside of you, Amen, to put that faith
[48:05] into action. And I believe we ought to
[48:07] be a people not only that has faith and
[48:09] say I believe. But there ought to be an
[48:11] action to our faith.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can say, "Well, I believe the
[48:15] words that said repent and be baptized."
[48:17] But if there's never a an action to
[48:20] that, if you never come to repentance
[48:22] and you never come to and to the action
[48:24] of being baptized, there will never be
[48:26] the the filling of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[48:28] There has to be an action. It has to be
[48:31] something applied to your faith. Now
[48:33] Noah, you know, his works expressed to
[48:35] man what his faith was in God's promise.
[48:38] God met with Noah and Noah said, you
[48:41] know, told Noah's going to rain and I'm
[48:43] going to destroy the whole earth. What
[48:44] if Noah said, "I believe you, Lord." And
[48:46] he just continued on.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Well, I believe that's that I believe
[48:49] that's going to happen. But he just
[48:50] continued on. Amen. What it's the same
[48:53] difference if we say, "Well, I believe
[48:54] in a rapture, but we're not preparing
[48:56] for it. We're not getting ready for it.
[48:58] We're not making oursel ready." Amen.
[49:00] The bride has made herself ready.
[49:03] There's an action taking place.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Noah, Noah's, you know, it's
[49:08] going to rain. I'm going to destroy the
[49:10] whole earth. It was an impossibility as
[49:11] we know there. But him being a carpenter
[49:14] and and having that in him and he
[49:16] believed what God had said, he went to
[49:18] work and he be to take his he did begin
[49:21] to take his footage and cut the boards
[49:23] and and find the right wood and put the
[49:25] pitch in and do exactly what God told.
[49:28] Could you imagine what people thought of
[49:30] that man in that day? That man is crazy
[49:32] because he said he's going to bring
[49:34] waters out of the heaven. There's no
[49:35] waters up there. But Noah didn't think
[49:37] about that. His works was expressing to
[49:40] people what his faith was and what God
[49:42] said.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he wasn't a a man who was just
[49:47] happy filling a pew.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. And well, I believe.
[49:53] I believe. No, we got to have something
[49:54] more than I believe.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the reason he says the
[49:59] genuine Christian separates himself with
[50:01] anything but God's word. No matter what
[50:03] people think, what anybody else says,
[50:05] you separate away from it. If you if you
[50:08] don't, it won't be long till his works
[50:10] will be made known. He'll fall back and
[50:12] he'll slip away and he'll join this one.
[50:14] He'll start this one. He'll show what he
[50:16] really is. But if he's a genuine, if the
[50:18] word of God is bedded into him, it's
[50:21] going to bring forth the seed that's on
[50:23] the inside. And there's going to be an
[50:25] ACTION THAT TAKES PLACE in his life.
[50:27] Yeah,
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Moses, he he he had a stick in his hand
[50:31] and he he was out there in the
[50:32] wilderness and he was watching over some
[50:34] sheep and he catch sight of this bush
[50:36] that was burning and and and this voice
[50:39] speaks out of and says, "Moses, take
[50:41] that stick in your hand and go down to
[50:43] Egypt and bring my children out with
[50:46] that little switch you got in your
[50:47] hand." It might as well been a switch
[50:48] compared to Pharaoh's army. Just lick
[50:51] the whole thing with this switch. What
[50:53] if Moses would have said, "Well, here
[50:55] just a moment. I I thought I was talking
[50:57] to an intelligent being and the great I
[50:59] am that you say you are. But here the
[51:01] world, how in the world will I ever take
[51:04] over with this little switch I got and
[51:07] this hand and I I take over an army of a
[51:09] million men and armed with spears and
[51:11] fighters and I'm not a fighter. I'm a
[51:13] shepherd and how can I ever do that?
[51:15] There wasn't no question why there was
[51:17] something caught in his heart. He was a
[51:19] predestinated person for a predestinated
[51:21] moment. Amen. Gifts and callings were
[51:24] out. Repentance. God had told Abraham he
[51:26] was going to do it. Here was a GROUND
[51:28] PREPARED. AND BROTHER BRANDON SAID, "OH,
[51:30] I'm hope I'm preaching to ground that is
[51:32] prepared this evening." Amen. I hope
[51:34] that I'm preaching to ground that's
[51:36] prepared. Amen. Not not A PEOPLE THAT'S
[51:39] A PREPARED PEOPLE FOR A PREPARED MOMENT.
[51:42] AMEN. THAT ARE CATCHING A REVELATION
[51:43] THAT IT MIGHT BE CRAZY TO THE WORLD, BUT
[51:46] I BELIEVE HE'S COMING BACK LIKE HE SAID.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THE TRUMPET'S GOING TO SOUND
[51:51] AND THE DEAD IN CHRIST ARE GOING TO
[51:52] RISE. YES.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Before there's an action, amen, to our
[51:57] belief. So Moses, what if he just sat
[51:59] there in his tent the rest of his life
[52:01] and twiddled it with no action? Well, I
[52:04] believe. I believe I've met an angel. I
[52:06] I believe. No, it caused an action to
[52:08] take place.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Caused something to happen. So Moses
[52:12] took his switch and went down there and
[52:14] took the nation out of a nation. And
[52:17] when he came with this stick in his hand
[52:19] and he told Pharaoh, "Let my people go."
[52:21] Pharaoh seen in Moses the works,
[52:25] &gt;&gt; but God saw in Moses the faith.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT GOD SAID TO DO, WHAT GOD
[52:33] PROMISED HE WAS GOING TO DO. HE HAD
[52:35] FAITH IN THE PROMISE OF GOD THAT GOD
[52:38] THAT MADE THE PROMISE WAS GOING TO BACK
[52:40] UP HIS WORD.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; So he went down and took over. No other
[52:44] man could have done that. No other man
[52:45] could could have done what Moses did.
[52:47] Moses was prepared for that moment.
[52:51] Noah was prepared for the I've said this
[52:53] many times. I'm thankful God didn't call
[52:54] me to be Noah.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Especially after I saw that boat, that
[52:57] replica. I was like, "Thank God I
[52:59] didn't. This was not my job."
[53:01] &gt;&gt; But it had to be a man that was prepared
[53:03] for it.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; It is no different than God preparing a
[53:07] people for this moment.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:11] SOMEBODY THAT'S GOING TO HAVE MORE THAN
[53:13] JUST a belief, BUT SOMETHING ANCHORED
[53:15] DOWN on the inside OF THEIR HEART.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; THAT'LL PUT WHAT THEY BELIEVE INTO
[53:20] ACTION.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[53:26] Here he was.
[53:29] He says, you know, he goes on, brother
[53:30] Brandham, go listen to faith expressed.
[53:33] It's a wonderful sermon. David with a
[53:35] sleepp a shepherd's sling expressed to
[53:38] the whole Israelite army the faith that
[53:40] he had in his God.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Now he could have said I believed. I
[53:44] believe I believe. I believe. I believe.
[53:47] But he began to express what he really
[53:49] believed when he got down into that
[53:52] valley and started picking out some
[53:53] rocks.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; That's what that's why they say it's
[53:58] more than just saying it, right? More
[53:59] than just words.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; This message is more than just words.
[54:04] This is what this is what James was
[54:06] saying. What if somebody come to you
[54:07] needing needing food, needed needed
[54:09] clothing, and you say, "Well, go be warm
[54:11] and be fed." But you don't do anything
[54:13] to give them warmth. You don't do
[54:14] anything to give them something to eat.
[54:16] You know, go just go be warm and be fed.
[54:18] Well, that sounds really good. And
[54:20] words,
[54:21] &gt;&gt; but words ain't doing me no good during
[54:23] that moment.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Amen. Saul, he had all kind
[54:28] of words. Yeah,
[54:29] &gt;&gt; his brothers had all kind of words. But
[54:32] David didn't come in word only.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; But he come in manifestation.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; HE COME IN ACTION. HE COME IN LOOKING
[54:40] AND SAY, "LISTEN, I JUST DON'T JUST know
[54:42] the God that I serve. I don't just
[54:44] believe the God I serve, BUT THERE'S
[54:46] SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF ME THAT SAYS
[54:48] IF I GO DOWN TO THAT VALLEY, THE GOD
[54:50] THAT I SERVE WILL MEET ME THERE." AMEN.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; It was revealed to David.
[54:59] And here this giant, this Philistine,
[55:02] this giant
[55:04] David may may have been just a little
[55:05] run of a guy. May apparently he wasn't
[55:08] much to look at. Wasn't much to think
[55:10] about. Wasn't much to him because even
[55:12] his daddy passed him over. Didn't even
[55:13] call him when it was time for to be for
[55:15] the prophet to come to their house and
[55:17] to anoint a man for to be a king. Right?
[55:19] Remember the story?
[55:20] &gt;&gt; He didn't even call him.
[55:23] He looked out at all the sons and said,
[55:25] "Well, what? I know God sent me to your
[55:28] house. Do you not have one more boy? Do
[55:30] you not have another son?" "Well, I got
[55:32] this guy, this young guy. He he ain't
[55:34] much. He's out there tending." Well,
[55:36] call him on up here. And he's anointed
[55:39] and he's poured the oil over him and and
[55:41] and he and but that's he needed it was
[55:43] more than that.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; It ain't just It ain't just It ain't
[55:48] Well, I'm anointed. Well, I've got this.
[55:49] I GOT NO, IT'S PUTTING it into action.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; IT'S STEPPING OUT IN FAITH AND BELIEVING
[55:55] WHAT YOU SAY you believe.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is where he was at. Now,
[55:59] DAVID, IT WAS REVEALED to him. And here
[56:01] this boasting uncircumcised Philistine
[56:04] out THERE WAS CALLING HIM OUT.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; HE also had words.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "Brother B said, we'll call him
[56:12] CANCER TONIGHT. WE'LL CALL HIM
[56:13] PARALYTIC. You can call him whatever YOU
[56:15] WANT TO." DAVID WAS NO MATCH FOR HIM
[56:18] WITH ANY kind of weapon.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; With any kind of weapon, HE WAS NO
[56:22] MATCH. THIS MAN'S SHOULDERS WAS SO BIG.
[56:25] HE WAS STANDING SO TALL. BIGGEST MAN you
[56:27] could ever imagine. A spear like a
[56:29] weaver's ne beam. And here he is. You
[56:32] know, it looks LIKE AN INVINCIBLE FORCE.
[56:34] BUT DAVID WAS NOT looking at the giant.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; HE WAS LOOKING AT THE PROMISE THAT GOD
[56:40] HAD PUT IN HIS LIFE. AND GOD HAD
[56:42] ANOINTED HIM TO BE KING.
[56:45] GOD HAD POURED HAD A PROPHET COME AND
[56:48] ANOINTED HIM FOR THE MOMENT.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; COME ON. BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. HE
[56:54] DIDN'T SEND A PROPHET FOR NO REASON. HE
[56:56] SENT A PROPHET TO ANOINT A BRIDE FOR A
[56:58] CERTAIN MOMENT.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; I remember being down in South America.
[57:09] I've used this phrase a time or two, but
[57:11] I remember brother Danny Steamman
[57:13] speaking about Goliath and the brothers
[57:15] and he says he said they had all the
[57:17] quotes. He said matter of fact, he said
[57:18] they was in their tents with their
[57:19] laptop popped up and they was trying to
[57:21] find a quote how to defeat this guy.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; He said but God didn't need a quote.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; He needed a live voice.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; It's got to become more than quotes.
[57:36] It's got to become a lived voice.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; A voice that's willing. Amen. A body
[57:41] that's willing to walk down into that
[57:43] valley.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WILLING TO PICK OUT FIVE STONES
[57:46] AND SAY, "HEY, TODAY I'M GOING TO CUT
[57:49] YOUR HEAD OFF."
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Little David standing there with just a
[57:54] little piece of leather, goat skin,
[57:55] sheep skin, two pieces OF STRING TIE,
[57:58] BUT SOMETHING HAD BEEN REVEALED.
[57:59] REVELATION HAD STRUCK HIM. THE GOD THAT
[58:02] TOOK ME OUT OF THE PAW OF THE BEAR, THAT
[58:04] TOOK ME OUT OF THE PAW OF THE LION, HOW
[58:06] MUCH MORE CAN HE DELIVER ME FROM AN
[58:09] UNCIRCUMCISED FELISTIC?
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Come on, SOMEBODY. AMEN. THE GOD THAT
[58:17] SAVED YOU AND SAVED YOUR LIFE AND FILLED
[58:19] YOU WITH THE HOLY GHOST. HOW MUCH MORE
[58:21] CAN HE HEAL YOUR BODY? His
[58:28] brothers, they were well more than way
[58:30] more able to do it. Saul, he was head
[58:33] and shoulders above the rest of the
[58:34] army, but it wasn't revealed. It wasn't
[58:36] a revelation. They believed it could be
[58:38] done.
[58:40] They believed that God could do it. They
[58:44] just didn't believe God could do it in
[58:46] them.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it was revealed to David.
[58:49] There's a difference. Amen. He says, he
[58:52] says, see, it's just like this right
[58:54] here. In that moment,
[58:56] he said, God could take that little boy
[58:59] and drop a seed of faith into his heart.
[59:01] That same God in this moment could take
[59:04] that woman from a wheelchair. This man
[59:07] from this situation, when that little
[59:08] grain of faith is revealed to you, he
[59:11] said, "I don't care how long it takes."
[59:12] Notice the giant on the other side
[59:13] didn't believe it. Neither will the
[59:15] cancer believe it. He'll laugh at you.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm a dog. Am I a dog? YOU SEND A
[59:20] KID OUT HERE TO FIGHT ME, I'LL PICK YOU
[59:22] UP AT THE END OF MY SPEARS and let the
[59:24] birds eat your flesh. You see, that
[59:26] didn't shake DAVID AT ALL. IT WAS
[59:28] REVEALED TO HIM.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; HE HAD FAITH IN WHAT HE WAS DOING. BUT
[59:32] HE ALSO HAD AN ACTION TO THE FAITH TO
[59:34] CARRY HIM DOWN TO FACE HIS GIANT
[59:37] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT WAS REVEALED TO HIM. HE
[59:38] KNEW WHERE HE WAS STANDING. AND IF GOD
[59:41] WOULD JUST SPEAK RIGHT DOWN IN YOUR
[59:43] HEART TONIGHT, AND YOU'LL SEE HE'LL
[59:45] SPEAK, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE LAYING IN
[59:46] THAT SITUATION NO LONGER. YOU'RE NOT
[59:48] GOING TO BE SITTING IN THAT CHAIR NO
[59:50] MORE. YOU'RE GOING TO GET WELL. THERE
[59:52] AIN'T NOTHING GOING TO CHANGE YOUR MIND
[59:54] FROM THAT MOMENT ON.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:00:05] He goes on down to Samson. He said,
[1:00:07] "Here's Samson caught out off guard and
[1:00:10] out there in the prairie and here come a
[1:00:12] thousand Philistines. He looked down on
[1:00:13] the ground. And there was a old mule
[1:00:14] that died and he picked up a jawbone dry
[1:00:17] as it can be and took out after those
[1:00:18] Philistines, beating them over the head
[1:00:20] with this old dry bone of a mule. As far
[1:00:22] as I know, not a tooth ever fell out of
[1:00:24] it.
[1:00:26] And them Philistines held it maybe an
[1:00:28] inch thick, beat one end after another.
[1:00:31] Amen. But he took the jawbone of that
[1:00:33] mule and he beat down a thousand
[1:00:35] Philistines and the jawbone never broke.
[1:00:38] He just kept beating them. And I've
[1:00:41] always said, how dumb were they?
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; It just blows my mind. You think about
[1:00:47] it and that kind of, you know, how
[1:00:48] stupid were they? I mean, 501,
[1:00:53] let's get out of here.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; No, they waited till a thousand of them
[1:00:56] dead.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Dumb old devil.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; He just keep beating them. They stood
[1:01:03] up. He'd beat another. Rest of them took
[1:01:04] off the rocks. THEY WERE GETTING AWAY.
[1:01:06] HE BELIEVED IT. WHAT? HE SAID, "I WANT
[1:01:08] TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. WORK ON THAT
[1:01:10] PULSATION
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; THAT SPUR THE MOMENT LIKE JOSHUA DID,
[1:01:15] MARY MAGDALENE, ALL THOSE JUST THAT
[1:01:16] MOMENT WHEN SOMETHING IS REVEALED TO
[1:01:19] YOU, GRAB A HOLD OF IT.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YES, IT WAS REVEALED TO HIM AND HE
[1:01:24] WENT AND MET THOSE THOUSAND PHILISTINES.
[1:01:26] NOW, you think about it. Ah, look at
[1:01:28] here. That old shrimp, he's coming
[1:01:29] again. Look at a little boy.
[1:01:31] What's he got there? Just a jawbone
[1:01:32] whack.
[1:01:36] DOWN GOES ONE. WHACK. DOWN GOES ANOTHER.
[1:01:39] WHAT WAS IT? HE WAS REVEALING TO THEM.
[1:01:41] HE WAS EXPRESSING TO THE PHILISTINES
[1:01:44] WHAT GOD HAD PUT IN HIS HEART to do.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I HOPE SOMEBODY GOD HAS PUT
[1:01:51] IN YOUR HEART TONIGHT TO WHOOP SOME
[1:01:52] DEVILS.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. MAYBE YOU CAN'T FIND BUT ONE OLD
[1:01:57] DRIED UP PROMISE SOMEWHERE, BUT IT'S
[1:01:59] STILL A PROMISE. IT'S JUST WAITING FOR
[1:02:01] SOMEBODY TO GRAB A HOLD OF IT AND START
[1:02:04] EXPRESSING TO THAT DEVIL WHAT GOD HAS
[1:02:07] PUT IN YOUR HEART.
[1:02:11] MAYBE YOU AIN'T SEEN THAT PROMISE
[1:02:12] FULFILLED IN A LONG TIME. IT'S STILL A
[1:02:15] PROMISE.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; There has to be an action.
[1:02:23] You know, there was lepers one time that
[1:02:24] sat at a gate
[1:02:26] said, "Why are we going to sit here till
[1:02:28] we die?
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Let's do something about this." and they
[1:02:32] got up and they put action to their to
[1:02:34] their words
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; and they begin to make an effort
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; and with four lepers, God caused
[1:02:42] confusion in the enemy.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; With four lepers,
[1:02:47] he said, "See what we need to do? You
[1:02:49] need to make an effort.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Get up."
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Get up. Well, the doctor's done all he
[1:02:58] can do. Get up anyhow.
[1:03:01] Everything's done, all they can do. THE
[1:03:03] NEXT STEP FOR GOD HAS DONE ALL HE CAN
[1:03:05] DO. THE NEXT THING TO DO is the next
[1:03:07] thing to do is FOR YOU TO ACT AND LET
[1:03:09] YOUR FAITH GO TO WORK IN GOD'S WORD.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Come on, somebody. Well, not
[1:03:18] just sit on your on your hind end and
[1:03:20] say, "I believe."
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; No, it's like Brother Tim said,
[1:03:24] sometimes you got to kick yourself in
[1:03:26] the hind end
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; and keep going, RIGHT? AMEN.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; KEEP MOVING.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; IT AIN'T ALWAYS EASY. IT AIN'T
[1:03:33] SUNSHINING ROSES. THIS THIS WALK THAT
[1:03:35] WE'RE ON. IT AIN'T ALWAYS A BUNCH OF OH,
[1:03:38] HALLELUJAH. Praise God. Everything good.
[1:03:40] ALL NO. THERE'S A LOT OF WARS AND RUMORS
[1:03:42] OF WARS.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A LOT OF DEMONS OUT THERE THAT'S
[1:03:45] GOING TO JUMP TRY TO JUMP YOU AND TRY TO
[1:03:46] MOVE. BUT I PROMISE YOU, WHEN A DEMON
[1:03:48] COMES, THERE'S A PROMISE LAYING THERE.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; That's already THE ANSWER FOR YOUR
[1:03:53] SITUATION. ALL IT NEEDS IS A HAND OF
[1:03:55] FAITH TO REACH OUT AND GRAB IT AND START
[1:03:58] EXPRESSING TO THAT DEVIL WHAT GOD HAS
[1:04:01] PUT IN YOUR HAND.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; SEE, we've been planted. He says in the
[1:04:09] in Christ Jesus, the inexhaustible
[1:04:11] fountain of life. Somebody say
[1:04:12] inexhaustible.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Inexhaustible.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; What we have to drink.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; That's right. You
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; ever heard the saying, you can lead a
[1:04:21] horse to water, but you can't make him
[1:04:22] drink.
[1:04:28] go a lot of places with that. But
[1:04:30] anyway,
[1:04:32] he says we have to start drinking. And
[1:04:34] the more you drink,
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; the more you're going to push out.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; It brings out these elements. The gift
[1:04:42] that God has called you to, well, the
[1:04:44] trouble of is you don't drink.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; You don't drink.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; You don't. This is a direct quote. You
[1:04:51] don't drink. Amen.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Don't you believe he's the inexhaustible
[1:04:54] fountain of life? Come to me all ye ends
[1:04:56] of the world and drink. The devil don't
[1:04:59] care how much you come as long as you
[1:05:02] don't drink.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; HE DOES NOT CARE HOW MANY TIMES YOU SIT
[1:05:08] ON THIS PEW.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T CARE HOW MANY TIMES YOU
[1:05:13] LISTEN TO A TAPE.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T CARE HOW MANY TIMES YOU READ
[1:05:18] YOUR BIBLE AS LONG AS YOU DON'T DRINK.
[1:05:25] THAT'S WHAT THE MEETING is for now.
[1:05:28] That's what this meeting is for now is
[1:05:30] for you to drink.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:35] You know I that's why God put it he put
[1:05:38] us here on free moral agency. So we have
[1:05:41] a choice to make.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; You have a choice.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Well, as you get older, you have choices
[1:05:47] you have to make. Do I keep going or do
[1:05:49] I just sit down and quit?
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Because it don't get no easier. I
[1:05:54] promise you.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; It doesn't get any easier. I know some
[1:05:59] of you young bucks are looking away. Ah,
[1:06:01] whatever. It's all easy. I can run up
[1:06:03] down that court and I don't hardly break
[1:06:04] a sweat. Just keep running.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Tim, myself, we used to run up
[1:06:09] down that court, too. Maybe not that
[1:06:11] one. Wasn't worse than that one.
[1:06:15] We would run, too. There would be things
[1:06:17] that happen. Now, we have a choice.
[1:06:20] Do we quit or do we keep moving?
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; And sometimes things inside of you want
[1:06:26] to just say, you know, just back off.
[1:06:28] Just stop a little bit. Just quit. And I
[1:06:31] want you to understand, I'm speaking
[1:06:32] more than just natural life here.
[1:06:34] Because there's so many times the
[1:06:36] devil's trying to get you to JUST STOP.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; JUST BACK OFF A LITTLE BIT.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; HE DON'T care if YOU COME TO CHURCH.
[1:06:42] JUST, YOU KNOW, DON'T DRINK. DON'T DON'T
[1:06:44] GET ALL INVOLVED in that. DON'T GET ALL
[1:06:46] CAUGHT UP IN WHAT HE'S REALLY SAYING.
[1:06:48] GET GET YOUR MIND OVER here and over
[1:06:50] there. Just, you know, DO YOUR CHRISTIAN
[1:06:51] DUTY. COME TO CHURCH. YOU KNOW, BE THERE
[1:06:53] ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT. I JUST GO make the
[1:06:56] effort, but just sit there and enjoy
[1:06:57] yourself and have a good time. Just, you
[1:07:00] know, just enjoying the presence OF GOD,
[1:07:01] BUT DON'T DRINK.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; You know, this is we've used this
[1:07:08] analogy before, but it's worth using
[1:07:10] again. When you have animals, you can
[1:07:12] see situations in their life. You can
[1:07:14] see, you know, they have anemas from
[1:07:16] from having parasites in their body.
[1:07:18] Their eyelids are pale. Brother Tim was
[1:07:20] very good at diagnosing them. He tell me
[1:07:22] to go get a certain drug, certain
[1:07:23] wormer, and to put it down. Listen, I'd
[1:07:25] go out there and I'd grab that goat
[1:07:26] around the neck. It didn't have a
[1:07:27] choice.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; It was taking the medicine,
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; right? It was going to take it. Whether
[1:07:34] it wanted it, whether it balled, whether
[1:07:36] it threw a fit, whether I had to wrestle
[1:07:37] it and throw it on the ground, it was
[1:07:39] going to take the medicine.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes,
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; we had to do that sometimes. You had to
[1:07:43] grab THAT THING AND THROW IT ON THE
[1:07:45] GROUND. GET ON TOP OF IT, STICK IT AND
[1:07:46] PUSH IT DOWN HIS THROAT. BUT IT WAS AN
[1:07:48] ANIMAL. GOD GOD DID NOT MAKE YOU AN
[1:07:50] ANIMAL. He made you somebody that has a
[1:07:53] choice.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Now, we can look at you AND WE CAN SEE
[1:07:56] THINGS, you know, that you need to
[1:07:57] tighten up or you need a you got a
[1:07:59] parasite, YOU GOT THIS. BUT WE CAN'T WE
[1:08:01] CAN OFFER YOU THE MEDICINE, BUT YOU HAVE
[1:08:03] TO DRINK.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; There has to BE AN ACTION TO YOUR FAITH.
[1:08:09] AND I BELIEVE WHAT BROTHER Timothy said.
[1:08:11] No, it's more than just believing. Take
[1:08:12] it and receive it.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; There's a fountain open fro flowing
[1:08:17] freely. Just drink till you can't drink
[1:08:19] no more. The tree of it drink to what?
[1:08:22] It's what is a lotment. What was it? It
[1:08:25] you know here he said what's what's the
[1:08:26] matter with Christians? They don't drink
[1:08:28] enough. We want to drink till you can
[1:08:30] spread out and you can let somebody else
[1:08:32] see it.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; They see your works. See some say
[1:08:36] somebody else see it. Push out. give a
[1:08:38] testimony. Commit it to God. STEP ON
[1:08:40] OUT. CLAIM GOD'S PROMISE. Just commit IT
[1:08:42] TO GOD. COMMIT THY WAYS to the Lord.
[1:08:44] He'll bring it to pass. Whatever you
[1:08:45] want. But he can't do it as long as
[1:08:47] you're holding it and say, "Well, I'll
[1:08:49] see if I get any better. I'll see if
[1:08:52] THIS WORKS." YOU COMMIT IT TO HIM AND
[1:08:54] FORGET about the rest of it AND GO
[1:08:56] TESTIFYING OF THE THINGS YOU DON'T EVEN
[1:08:58] SEE, but yet YOU BELIEVE IT. IT'S NOT
[1:09:00] WHAT YOU SEE, IT'S WHAT YOU BELIEVE.
[1:09:03] IT'S NOT WHAT YOU FEEL, IT'S WHAT YOU
[1:09:05] BELIEVE. AMEN.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; That's how you're saved is by faith.
[1:09:10] That's how you're healed is by faith.
[1:09:12] Faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:09:14] for.
[1:09:16] He said, "Now all you with faith, you're
[1:09:17] afraid to put it to work.
[1:09:20] It won't do any good. Why not just lay
[1:09:23] aside everything that's unlike faith?
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Believe and act on what you believe.
[1:09:29] What you believe, not what you feel, not
[1:09:31] what your senses say. That's right.
[1:09:34] Not what they bear witness of, but what
[1:09:36] your faith bears witness of.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; You have faith in God, then act like you
[1:09:41] have faith in God.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Come on. If Abraham says, "I got faith
[1:09:47] in God, but was afraid to offer his son
[1:09:49] Isaac," then his faith was no good.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Now, Paul justified Abraham by faith.
[1:09:55] Paul was talking about what God seen in
[1:09:56] Abraham. James justified him by works.
[1:09:59] James was talking about what man seen in
[1:10:01] Abraham. FAITH. GOD SEES YOUR FAITH. Man
[1:10:04] sees your works. And if you say you have
[1:10:06] faith and you're afraid to step out and
[1:10:09] make works out of it, then it don't do
[1:10:10] no good. It'll never do you any good.
[1:10:13] You've got TO BELIEVE IT. BUT YOU ALSO
[1:10:15] got to accept IT AND THEN YOU'VE GOT TO
[1:10:17] ACT UPON IT.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; God can do nothing for you until first
[1:10:24] by faith you accept it and believe and
[1:10:27] confess it and act upon it. Amen.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; The only way God can act now is when you
[1:10:33] act first.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Direct quote. The only way God can act
[1:10:42] now is when you act first.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Cuz he's a high priest making
[1:10:48] intercessions on your confession of your
[1:10:50] faith in his finished work.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; He said, "I don't believe anyone can
[1:10:54] find fault with that. That's the basis
[1:10:56] of divine healing." He said, 'You people
[1:10:58] here that's real sick. I want you to
[1:10:59] look listen close now. He said that 25
[1:11:02] cents is your faith. Your faith is the
[1:11:03] purchasing power of your healing. If I
[1:11:05] had 25 cents, I I could not eat the 25
[1:11:07] cents. The 25 cents is not the bread,
[1:11:09] but it's the power that purchase it. But
[1:11:11] when you receive the faith, faith is the
[1:11:13] purchasing power of your healing. Now,
[1:11:15] if you get me, give me the 25 cents and
[1:11:17] maybe the grocery store is 5 miles away.
[1:11:19] I can rejoice as much as the 25 cents in
[1:11:22] my hand as I have with a loaf of bread
[1:11:24] because I have the possession in my
[1:11:26] possession to purchase the power of the
[1:11:27] bread. Now, listen friends, when you
[1:11:29] receive faith, if you really believe it,
[1:11:31] you're just as good as healed right
[1:11:33] then. Though you might not be able to
[1:11:35] move right then.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Now, it's not something that you
[1:11:39] imagine. It's something that you It's
[1:11:40] not something that you work up to. It's
[1:11:42] something that you possess. You have it.
[1:11:45] YOU GOT YOU COULD SHOW YOU HAVE MY 25
[1:11:47] cents. That's the purchasing POWER OF
[1:11:49] THE BREAD. AND WHEN YOU GOT THE FAITH,
[1:11:52] YOU PROVE IT BY THE WAY YOU ACT.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; By the way,
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; BY THE WAY,
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; YOUR ACTIONS PROVE REALLY WHAT FAITH YOU
[1:12:08] REALLY HAVE.
[1:12:13] NO MATTER how sick you are, what about
[1:12:15] it?
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; No matter how sick you are, what about
[1:12:20] it?
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; I love that. You got to first believe he
[1:12:24] does it, then confess that he's done it
[1:12:25] before he can even go to work. How many
[1:12:27] knows that when you come to the altar,
[1:12:29] you pray to be forgiven of your sins. It
[1:12:31] isn't because you cry. It isn't because
[1:12:34] you confess. It's because you believe.
[1:12:37] And when you believe, you stand up and
[1:12:40] testify.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; There's an action.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; You go outside after you accept Christ
[1:12:48] and that old crowd says, "You ain't no
[1:12:49] different. There's nothing different."
[1:12:50] But you believe you're different. But
[1:12:52] what what if you say, "I guess I didn't
[1:12:54] get it." Well, you got another trip to
[1:12:57] the altar coming.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. But when you
[1:13:00] believe you have, you say, "Yes, I am."
[1:13:02] Then you believe you're a Christian. You
[1:13:03] can show nothing that you are, but you
[1:13:05] believe you are. You believe with all
[1:13:07] your heart, then you confess that you
[1:13:09] are. And when you confess him and he
[1:13:11] confesses you, he's a high priest
[1:13:13] working on that. Not on your crying, not
[1:13:15] on your repenting, not on your faith,
[1:13:18] not but on your confession. No matter
[1:13:19] how much faith you got, it'll never do
[1:13:21] you no good TILL YOU PUT WORKS WITH IT.
[1:13:24] FOR FAITH WITHOUT WORKS IS DEAD.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; THE BODY WITHOUT THE SPIRIT IS DEAD. AND
[1:13:32] WHEN YOU SAY, "I BELIEVE CHRIST AND
[1:13:34] ACCEPT IT AND GO SAYING SO.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; I ACCEPT WHAT HE DONE FOR ME. I ACCEPT
[1:13:40] THAT I'M HIS.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; But as soon as you start confessing,
[1:13:45] well, I don't know if this message is
[1:13:47] even for me.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; I don't know if I'm even a real
[1:13:51] Christian.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; I don't know." What are you You're
[1:13:54] starting to confess all your doubts and
[1:13:56] things Satan's put in your mind and all
[1:13:58] that nonsense and you'll go right back
[1:14:00] the other way. That's right.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; No, no.
[1:14:05] I believe Christ,
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; then accept it and go saying so.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; He met me here.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; I know he met me here.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; He answered my questions.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; He promised me he would be here. He
[1:14:20] promised me he'd never leave me or
[1:14:22] forsake me. Amen. Then you associate
[1:14:24] with those who are Christians. You act
[1:14:26] like a Christian. You say you're a
[1:14:27] Christian. You believe you're a
[1:14:28] Christian. Then you associate those that
[1:14:29] are Christian. It works righteousness.
[1:14:31] AFTER A WHILE, EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU'RE A
[1:14:33] CHRISTIAN BECAUSE YOU HOLD YOUR
[1:14:35] CONFESSION. YOU ACT LIKE IT.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; YOU ACT LIKE IT. YOU GO DOWN THE STREET
[1:14:41] SAYING, "I may," you don't you maybe I'm
[1:14:43] a Christian. Maybe I'm not. NO, YOU GO,
[1:14:45] "I AM A CHRISTIAN."
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; I AM A DAUGHTER OF GOD. I AM A SON OF
[1:14:50] GOD.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; IT MATTERS NOT WHAT MY DOUBTS SAY OR MY
[1:14:53] FAULTS MAY SAY OR WHATEVER. I AM A
[1:14:55] DAUGHTER OF GOD. AMEN.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; He can only do as you say because he's a
[1:15:01] high priest of what you confess.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; He was wounded for your transgressions.
[1:15:06] He was bruised for your iniquity. And
[1:15:08] with his stripes, you were already
[1:15:10] healed.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, any of those things,
[1:15:13] now listen, any of those things, if
[1:15:15] you're weary, upset, fretting, nervous,
[1:15:19] sick, sin, whatever it is, when you
[1:15:23] accept from your heart, God has taken
[1:15:25] care of it, go confessing it's done.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Say it right until you believe it right.
[1:15:34] He said, "But if you're afraid to say so
[1:15:36] and afraid to act upon your confession,
[1:15:38] no matter how many times YOU'RE PRAYED
[1:15:40] FOR, YOU WILL NEVER GET WELL."
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; You've got to believe it. But then YOU
[1:15:48] HAVE TO ACT UPON IT. HOW MANY
[1:15:49] UNDERSTANDS that now? Raise your hands.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Only what? ONLY WHEN YOU SAY SO. IF
[1:15:55] YOU'RE PRAYED FOR AND you say, "Now I
[1:15:57] believe." Yes, sir. Now, you can't say
[1:15:59] you believe until you really do believe.
[1:16:01] But if you do, you do something not
[1:16:03] right. You can't say you believe until
[1:16:04] you are really in your heart you
[1:16:05] believe. BUT WHEN YOU FIRMLY HAVE PRAYED
[1:16:07] THROUGH AND REALLY believe and you can
[1:16:09] say I believe then you accept it.
[1:16:11] Remember he's there. He'll make anything
[1:16:14] good that you believe in your heart he
[1:16:16] has done and will confess it. THEN
[1:16:18] EVERYWHERE YOU GO TESTIFY I AM HEALED.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; IT IS DONE. GOD DID IT.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT NERVOUS NO MORE. I'M NOT UPSET
[1:16:29] NO MORE. RIGHT.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; WELL, BROTHER TIMOTHY, I STILL FEEL THAT
[1:16:34] WAY. IT DOESN'T HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH
[1:16:36] YOUR FEELING. IT HAS TO DO WITH THE
[1:16:38] FAITH THAT GOD HAS PLACED ON YOUR HEART.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; It's time to LET OUR ACTION OF FAITH
[1:16:45] BECOME GREATER THAN OUR ACTION OF OUR
[1:16:47] FEELINGS.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; We act out our feelings really good.
[1:16:52] It's time we start acting out our faith.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:59] He said, "It'll never fail." I tell you,
[1:17:02] it'll never fail.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; It'll never fail. That's right.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "I've seen cancer healed with
[1:17:08] it." You know, sarcomus cancer. We got
[1:17:11] dozen piles of letter, doctor
[1:17:13] statements, lame, halt, blind, cancer
[1:17:15] ridden, everything that can be thought
[1:17:17] of the way the way of diseases have been
[1:17:19] healed. Faith.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; I love this one right here. Uh,
[1:17:30] listen how brother Brandham puts this so
[1:17:31] simple.
[1:17:34] Said, "Of course I see you hopping
[1:17:35] along, lady. There's something wrong
[1:17:38] somewhere. You got arthritis.
[1:17:42] Throw that thing down and pick up Jesus
[1:17:44] Christ in your heart and say, "Get out
[1:17:46] of here, Satan, and get off of my body."
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; And then walk off the platform normal
[1:17:52] and well. Do you believe it? Will you
[1:17:55] accept it? Will you act upon it?
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Did you hear what he said? Do you
[1:18:01] believe it? Will you accept it? Will you
[1:18:04] act upon it?
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Remember, she's hopping along. Got
[1:18:06] arthritis, crippled up. Will you believe
[1:18:09] it? Do you believe it? Will you accept
[1:18:10] it? Will you act UPON IT? OKAY, STOMP
[1:18:13] YOUR FEET ON THE FLOOR.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; STOMP YOUR FEET ON THE FLOOR AND WALK
[1:18:19] ACROSS THE PLATFORM AND GO OUT OF HERE
[1:18:21] THANKING GOD WITH YOUR HANDS HELD UP IN
[1:18:23] THE AIR SHOUTING.
[1:18:25] AND PRAISING GOD.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; PUT SOME ACTION TO YOUR FAITH. YOU BE
[1:18:30] BELIEVE IT, PUT SOME ACTION TO IT.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; BELIEVE THAT IT'S ALREADY DONE. STOMP
[1:18:35] YOUR FOOT.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; OH, come on. Let's have a stomping party
[1:18:40] this evening. Amen. I want some dust
[1:18:42] flying up in the air from people
[1:18:43] stomping their feet over that devil's
[1:18:45] head. They've been trying to tell you,
[1:18:46] you'll never get well. Never get over
[1:18:48] it. Never rise above IT. NEVER. NEVER.
[1:18:50] YOU won't see your children say stomp
[1:18:52] your foot.
[1:18:54] PUT IT DOWN ON THAT DEVIL AND SAY,
[1:18:56] "DEVIL, I'M WALKING OUT OF HERE. I'M
[1:18:59] WALKING OUT OF HERE DELIVERED. I'M
[1:19:00] WALKING OUT OF HERE WITH THE NAME OF
[1:19:02] JESUS CHRIST FIRMLY AND PLANTED IN MY
[1:19:05] LIFE, CONFESSING it's already done."
[1:19:10] Oh, DO YOU WANT THE SAME THING, BROTHER?
[1:19:12] THEN YOU TAKE OFF AND DO IT IN THE NAME
[1:19:14] OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Because the same Jesus the same
[1:19:21] yesterday, today, and forever. He's the
[1:19:24] same one. Can't you get that soak
[1:19:26] through you? That's Jesus Christ, the
[1:19:28] son. Can you hear? Can you recognize?
[1:19:31] Then act on it.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Every sick person that's in here, God
[1:19:36] has already healed you.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you,
[1:19:44] Lord Jesus.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; I just felt it right there.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Every sick person in here, God has
[1:19:50] already healed you.
[1:19:54] He's already healed you.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Oh God, help me, Lord. Can you recognize
[1:20:00] it? Then act upon it.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; EVERY SICK PERSON THAT'S IN HERE, GOD
[1:20:05] HAS ALREADY HEALED YOU WHEN HE DIED AT
[1:20:08] CALVARY.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; YOU BELIEVE THAT? THEN STAND TO YOUR
[1:20:12] FEET AND ACCEPT HIM AS YOUR HEALER.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; ACCEPT HIM AS YOUR SAVIOR. RAISE YOUR
[1:20:17] HANDS UP. GO INTO ACTION.
[1:20:20] GO INTO ACTION. GET OUT OF THE
[1:20:22] WHEELCHAIRS. GET OUT OF YOUR MAIN
[1:20:24] POSITION. GET OUT OF YOUR SITUATION. GO
[1:20:27] INTO ACTION.
[1:20:32] Everyone in HERE THAT'S BEEN BOUND BY
[1:20:34] FEAR AND NERVOUSNESS AND DEPRESSION, GET
[1:20:37] UP.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; RISE UP AND SAY, "DEVIL, I AM NOT
[1:20:41] TOLERATING THAT NO LONGER. I AM A
[1:20:43] DAUGHTER OF GOD. I AM A SON OF GOD. I
[1:20:46] HAVE BEEN BOUGHT WITH A PRICE. HE'S
[1:20:48] ALREADY HEALED ME. IT'S ALREADY DONE.
[1:20:51] IT'S ALREADY FINISHED.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; No one could have come back and
[1:21:08] said, "God told me it's going to rain.
[1:21:11] That's enough. That settles it."
[1:21:13] So, that's just what's going to happen.
[1:21:15] It's going to rain.
[1:21:17] What you going to do about it? No. All
[1:21:18] right. It's God's word. He says it's
[1:21:20] going to rain.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; It's the word of the Lord. Thus says the
[1:21:24] Lord. What are you going to do about it,
[1:21:25] Noah? Just walk around and preach about
[1:21:27] it?
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; No, sir. I'm going to make ready for it.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, that would be a miracle. Days of
[1:21:36] miracles is passed.
[1:21:40] So say they that believe that. I happen
[1:21:42] to be one that don't believe that
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; because I also believe what the prophet
[1:21:47] of God said. He said God is the day. He
[1:21:49] is a day of miracles.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; And if God with the day of miracles
[1:21:52] exist cease to exist, then God ceases to
[1:21:55] exist.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, that'd be a miracle. The days of
[1:22:02] miracles has pass. Oh, just hold on.
[1:22:06] You'll see it after a while.
[1:22:11] Well, what you going to do? I've been
[1:22:13] commissioned to build an ark for rain.
[1:22:15] And he built the ark before the rain
[1:22:17] fell. What was he doing? Acting on the
[1:22:19] promise.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Acting on the promise.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Ah. He said, "I feel kind of Pentecostal
[1:22:25] right now, right? Real religious. Take
[1:22:27] God at his word. Act upon the promise.
[1:22:30] Regardless of what takes place, it's up
[1:22:32] to God to fulfill his word.
[1:22:36] That's right.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; JUST START KNOCKING THE CLOUDS. OH MY.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. THAT OLD CLOUD THAT
[1:22:45] WANTS TO HANG OVER YOU, JUST START
[1:22:46] KNOCKING THE CLOUDS. HE SAID, "LAY ASIDE
[1:22:48] EVERY WEIGHT THAT WAS SO EASILY BESET
[1:22:50] YOU. LAY ASIDE YOUR DOUBTS. LAY ASIDE
[1:22:52] YOUR FEAR. LAY ASIDE YOUR GREED. LAY
[1:22:54] ASIDE EVERYTHING THAT'S CONTRARY TO THE
[1:22:57] WORD OF GOD. JESUS CHRIST IS JUST THE
[1:22:59] SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER. LAY
[1:23:01] ASIDE ALL YOUR DOUBTS, ALL YOUR
[1:23:03] FRUSTRATION, AND JUST KEEP ON KNOCKING
[1:23:05] AWAY THE CLOUDS. THE LAST CHUNK'S GOING
[1:23:08] TO COME OFF, AND HE'LL BE STANDING THERE
[1:23:10] READY TO MEET YOU.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. NO, IT SAID WHEN
[1:23:17] I GET THE ARK BUILT, HE WILL COME AND
[1:23:19] THE RAIN'S GOING TO START FALLING.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Moses again had to believe him. He had
[1:23:27] to act upon it. He had to act upon what
[1:23:30] God's word said. He wanted to see
[1:23:31] whether he was God or not. He said,
[1:23:32] "Well, Moses, act upon what I tell you."
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; We got all kind of wonderful words here.
[1:23:40] Start acting upon them.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; So, listen here. He said, "If you want
[1:23:45] to know who God is, then act upon what
[1:23:48] he says here.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Repent, be baptized in the name of the
[1:23:54] Lord Jesus Christ, and you'll become a
[1:23:56] miracle." That's his promise. Amen.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. Act on his word.
[1:24:02] And you shall receive the gift of the
[1:24:03] Holy Ghost. For the promises unto you
[1:24:04] and your children. Oh, that's just for
[1:24:06] the apostles. That's for the No, that's
[1:24:08] for them that are far off. As many as
[1:24:09] the Lord shall our God shall call.
[1:24:11] That's where the promise is too. Act
[1:24:13] upon his word and you'll see a real
[1:24:15] miracle.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Something will take place when you act
[1:24:19] upon his word like Gideon did. He acted
[1:24:21] on what God told him to do and God did a
[1:24:24] miracle.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; He defeated the Midianites. huge army
[1:24:28] with 300 people.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; That not sound like a miracle?
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; And they didn't have to do nothing but
[1:24:33] break some cl some pots and blow a
[1:24:35] trumpet.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; They didn't have to pick up a sword.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what kind of God we
[1:24:43] serve?
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; If you'll take him at his word, you
[1:24:48] don't even have to pick up a weapon.
[1:24:55] You just got to believe and start acting
[1:24:56] upon what he said for you to do
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; like Moses did. He did what he told.
[1:25:04] Throw down your rod.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; In other words, get rid of everything
[1:25:08] that's around you.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Let me have it.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Well, that's what he was telling Moses.
[1:25:15] Let me have it. You said, "Well, I got
[1:25:17] an offer, an awful temper, BROTHER
[1:25:19] TIMOTHY." GIVE IT TO GOD.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS HOW TO quieten it.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Well, I got a lot OF LOT OF LUST,
[1:25:27] BROTHER TIMOTHY. HE KNOWS HOW TO TAKE IT
[1:25:29] AWAY.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; JUST PUT IT IN HIS HANDS AND WATCH WHAT
[1:25:32] A MIRACLE CAN HAPPEN IN YOUR LIFE. GOD
[1:25:34] HAD TO MOSES HAD TO WORK ON THE WORD OF
[1:25:37] GOD AND OBEY THE WORD OF GOD BEFORE HE
[1:25:39] COULD SEE GOD'S MIRACLE. AND AFTER HE
[1:25:41] SAW IT, BROTHER, THERE WAS NOTHING GOING
[1:25:44] TO STOP him then. Amen.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Next day, we know the story. Zapora was
[1:25:49] sitting out on the mule. Little Gersham
[1:25:51] on his on her hip, whiskers hanging down
[1:25:54] Moses' face, face smiling, skies
[1:25:57] dancing. Sheep herder turned from a
[1:26:00] sheep herder to a mighty man of God, a a
[1:26:03] backsliding preacher to a man of valor
[1:26:06] going down to deliver. Look at Gideon.
[1:26:07] What happened? Yes, sir. Took down.
[1:26:09] Look, exactly what happened with him.
[1:26:11] Going down here, Moses again going down
[1:26:12] with a crooked stick to take over a
[1:26:14] nation. He did it. Sure, he did it. God
[1:26:16] told him to. No matter how unreal it
[1:26:18] seem, you just do what God tells you and
[1:26:20] you'll find out that his word is still
[1:26:21] the same today. Just get the clouds
[1:26:24] back. The sun is already shining.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Just get the clouds back. The sun is
[1:26:29] already shining. Joshua, oh, that great
[1:26:31] conqueror, the successor of Moses, a man
[1:26:34] that God loved, a mighty warrior, a man
[1:26:36] God loved. He said, "As I was with
[1:26:38] Moses, so I'll BE WITH YOU. BUT BEFORE
[1:26:40] THE WALLS FELL, JOSHUA MARCHED ACCORDING
[1:26:43] TO THE ORDERS OF THE CHIEF CAPTAIN
[1:26:45] AROUND THE WALL. BEFORE THE POWER OF GOD
[1:26:47] STRUCK A THING, HE MARCHED WITH BLIND
[1:26:50] WITH THE WORD. WHAT DID he do? HE ACTED
[1:26:52] UPON THE WORD before he saw the miracle.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, we want to see the miracle and then
[1:26:59] we're going to act good. Boy, we're
[1:27:00] going to jump and shout. No, you got to
[1:27:01] do you got to act before the miracle
[1:27:03] comes.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Where's your miracle?
[1:27:09] act on his word.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; If God be for us, where are the
[1:27:15] miracles?
[1:27:16] Really, what he's saying is where's the
[1:27:18] people acting on his word?
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Because if people are acting on his
[1:27:24] word, there will be miracles.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; If people are acting upon they shall lay
[1:27:32] hands upon the sick, they shall recover.
[1:27:34] There will be miracles, there will be
[1:27:35] healings, there will be deliverances. If
[1:27:37] people are acting upon the promises unto
[1:27:39] you and to your children and them that
[1:27:41] are far off, there's going to be people
[1:27:42] that are receiving those miracles.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; If people are acting upon by his
[1:27:49] stripes, I am healed.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Already healed, already done, there's
[1:27:53] going to be miracles taking place.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; We could go through many of them. Hebrew
[1:28:04] children. Daniel had to act upon the
[1:28:06] word.
[1:28:08] He said, "If you're sick,
[1:28:10] act upon his word. See if he heals." If
[1:28:12] you're a sinner, want to be filled with
[1:28:14] the Holy Ghost, come repent. Be baptized
[1:28:15] in the name of But upon the word and see
[1:28:18] what happens. If you still got the world
[1:28:20] in you, you women still wear short hair
[1:28:21] and you're still wearing makeup. You men
[1:28:23] still with tempers and fussing about
[1:28:24] your denom.
[1:28:26] That's how we get into this message. And
[1:28:28] we have people that say, "I believe the
[1:28:29] message." And they still wear makeup and
[1:28:31] they still cut their hair.
[1:28:33] because there's no actions to their
[1:28:35] faith.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, I believe. Well, so the devils
[1:28:39] believe.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; If you want to find out if he's still
[1:28:48] God, act upon it. Lay yourself on the
[1:28:50] altar and see what takes place. But you
[1:28:52] have to act upon his word first. Amen.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Daniel before he saw the miracle of God,
[1:28:57] before he was ever delivered from the
[1:28:58] lion's den, the first thing he do had to
[1:29:00] do was act upon the word of God. He said
[1:29:03] that for no one man to pray but only to
[1:29:05] the king. But he turned his eyes towards
[1:29:08] his God and begin to what was he doing?
[1:29:09] He was acting upon the word of God.
[1:29:11] Solomon had dedicated a temple and said,
[1:29:13] "Lord, if the people be in trouble
[1:29:14] anywhere, they look to this holy temple,
[1:29:17] you will hear FROM HEAVEN." DANIEL ACTED
[1:29:19] FIRST
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; AND THEN THE MIRACLE FOLLOWED.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's right.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Thing of it is you have to take it
[1:29:31] first. The word.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; The word is the action that you want,
[1:29:35] not your feelings.
[1:29:38] The feeling is not the action we want.
[1:29:41] As I said, we're so good about acting
[1:29:44] out our feelings.
[1:29:47] I want maybe sometimes people just want
[1:29:48] sympathy because of their sickness or
[1:29:50] sympathy because their trouble and
[1:29:52] they're real good about acting out their
[1:29:54] feeling, how they feel. It's time we
[1:29:56] start acting out our faith.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; We don't come to church based on our
[1:30:02] feelings.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Cuz I promise you, most of you probably
[1:30:05] wouldn't be here if you came on your
[1:30:06] feelings,
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Be honest. Well, I wouldn't have been
[1:30:11] here if I'd have been here on my
[1:30:12] feelings.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; I came here on my faith. Amen.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Believing that the God they said where
[1:30:19] two or three are gathered in my name,
[1:30:21] he'll be here.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; So I came by faith not to see you, not
[1:30:25] to see me, but to see JESUS
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE PROMISED HE WOULD BE HERE
[1:30:30] TONIGHT. He promised that he would come
[1:30:32] IN THIS BUILDING. AMEN. BY HIS WORD. HE
[1:30:34] HE PROMISED AND WE HAVE ACTED OUT. AMEN.
[1:30:37] WE PUT INTO ACTION BY GATHERING OURSEL
[1:30:39] EVEN THE MUCH MORE AS WE SEE THAT DAY
[1:30:41] APPROACHING AND COMING TOGETHER AND
[1:30:43] UNITING OUR FAITH TOGETHER. WHY? NOT TO
[1:30:45] SEE EACH OTHER. NOT TO HEAR JUST PRETTY
[1:30:47] SONGS AND PRETTY MUSIC. NOT TO HEAR
[1:30:49] SOMEBODY JUST SAY A FEW WORDS. BUT TO
[1:30:51] SEE JESUS,
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; TO SEE HIM MANIFESTED AMONG US. AMEN. TO
[1:30:57] SEE HIM DOING THE MIGHTY WORKS THAT HE
[1:30:59] DID 2,000 YEARS AGO, THAT HE DID 60
[1:31:02] YEARS AGO, THAT HE STILL DOES TODAY.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Because there's somebody that's standing
[1:31:08] upon his word and putting it into
[1:31:11] action.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you,
[1:31:14] Sister Atlanta did not go around this
[1:31:16] building on her feelings.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; She went around on her faith.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; And because she acted upon that faith,
[1:31:25] then she saw a miracle.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's real easy to run around a
[1:31:29] building when you got a clear cancer st
[1:31:32] cancer scan, right?
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Run around, shout, have hallelujah. I
[1:31:37] got it. But what about before?
[1:31:41] What about before you ever see a rock
[1:31:43] fall off the wall?
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; You start shouting
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; praising God and giving him glory and
[1:31:50] honor
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; and hallelujah and thank you God you
[1:31:54] brought me here. Thank you God you're
[1:31:55] with me. Thank you God you promised
[1:31:57] you'll never leave me or forsight. I
[1:31:58] might be in the darkest valley I've ever
[1:32:00] been in. I might be in the hardest trial
[1:32:02] I've ever been me. But I'm not here by
[1:32:04] myself. I'm here because you led me
[1:32:06] here. Yes.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; I'M HERE BECAUSE YOU HAVE BROUGHT ME TO
[1:32:09] THIS PLACE. AMEN. THAT YOU CAN SHOW ME
[1:32:12] WHAT A TRUE MIRACLE IS. YOU CAN SHOW ME
[1:32:14] WHO YOU REALLY ARE.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; We can see a God who's ready to act when
[1:32:30] we act.
[1:32:33] You can watch it. We can follow this
[1:32:34] pattern all the way through the
[1:32:35] scriptures.
[1:32:37] had to be an action. He's looking for
[1:32:39] somebody to believe him. Looking for
[1:32:41] somebody to take him at his word.
[1:32:43] Looking for somebody to step into the
[1:32:45] water.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Looking for somebody to to reach and
[1:32:51] grab a hold of what he promised and and
[1:32:53] hold on to it.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Not just I believe. It's so easy to say
[1:32:58] that
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; I believe.
[1:33:02] Sometimes it's a whole lot harder. It is
[1:33:04] a whole lot harder to actually step into
[1:33:06] that water before you see it open.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you feel like you're right up
[1:33:12] to your nose and you're about to go
[1:33:14] under.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; There's a hand of mercy. He's been
[1:33:20] watching for you and waiting. He waited
[1:33:23] till they got into the fire.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; He didn't show up when they was talking
[1:33:28] to the king.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, three children. Oh, king live
[1:33:32] forever.
[1:33:34] But we're not going to bow.
[1:33:36] Cuz you know why? Fourth man is here.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; We see him. No, they ain't see nothing.
[1:33:42] They just believe God's word.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Thou shall have no other graven image
[1:33:46] before me. It was not going to bow to
[1:33:48] anybody but their God.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; The true one living God. Amen. But he
[1:33:53] didn't show up till they came into the
[1:33:55] fire.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; He's good at that.
[1:34:01] He allowed you to go right into it and
[1:34:02] then boom, there he is.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; And you realize that fire was only for
[1:34:07] your good
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; only killed your enemy and burn and burn
[1:34:12] off your bands.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; And set you free that you can have
[1:34:16] fellowship with the fourth man.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; It takes a fourth a fire to produce a
[1:34:20] fourth man. It takes a red sea to
[1:34:22] produce a God who can open it up. It
[1:34:24] takes the walls of Jericho to produce a
[1:34:26] God who can tear them all down.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Come on. It takes a man WHO'S WILLING TO
[1:34:31] STAND UPON THE WORD OF GOD AND WILLING
[1:34:33] TO ACT UPON IT AND NOT BE SCARED ABOUT
[1:34:35] IT. AND YOU KNOW, WELL, I don't know. I
[1:34:37] JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND. I DON'T
[1:34:38] UNDERSTAND. LISTEN, FORGET ABOUT WHAT
[1:34:40] YOU DO OR DON'T UNDERSTAND. FORGET ABOUT
[1:34:42] YOUR INTELLECTUAL KNOWLEDGES OR OR WHAT
[1:34:44] YOU THINK OR WHAT YOU DON'T THINK.
[1:34:46] FORGET ABOUT ALL OF IT.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Devil whoops some of our young ladies
[1:34:55] around upon their feelings. I don't feel
[1:34:58] worthy. I don't feel like I I'm a part.
[1:35:00] I don't feel And some of our young men,
[1:35:03] I just don't feel loved.
[1:35:05] You don't feel loved.
[1:35:08] How much more could he do to show you
[1:35:09] that he loves you?
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; He died for you.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; He gave his life for you.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; So, you got to change that. We want to
[1:35:20] say, read the scripture because God so
[1:35:23] loved the world, you need to change it
[1:35:24] to God so loved Timothy
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Puit. Yes, that's right.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; God so loved Joshua Buts.
[1:35:32] God so loved Delaney. God so loved
[1:35:35] Jackson. Put your name there.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; God loved me.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; That's why he came.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; And I love him. That's why I believe and
[1:35:46] I confess and I act upon what he said.
[1:35:50] And I know that he's going to bring it
[1:35:51] to pass. No matter what my feelings say.
[1:35:54] That's right. No matter what I see
[1:35:55] around me, know what I No matter how
[1:35:57] dark it may seem, and no matter how bad
[1:35:59] it may look, and it may look impossible,
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; so it was for Noah, and so it was for
[1:36:05] Moses. And so it was for every person
[1:36:06] through the Bible, impossible. But we
[1:36:08] serve a God of impossibilities.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; And I believe he's in this building this
[1:36:13] evening. Amen. To make somebody believe
[1:36:15] that THERE'S STILL A GOD HERE WHO DOES
[1:36:17] THE IMPOSSIBLE.
[1:36:21] Let's
[1:36:24] buy our hearts.
[1:36:27] Tons of more pages.
[1:36:47] He says here, he said, "I might not have
[1:36:49] just the time for everyone at the
[1:36:51] platform, but everyone can benefit by
[1:36:54] it.
[1:36:57] If God can prove himself here to be God
[1:37:00] and what has confirmed
[1:37:04] what I've said to be the truth, then
[1:37:06] believe God. But then act on your faith
[1:37:10] and put your faith as a living action
[1:37:14] and God will go to work on you right
[1:37:16] there and will make you well then.
[1:37:24] What was his
[1:37:26] what are you getting at, brother
[1:37:27] Timothy? Brother brother brother
[1:37:28] Brandham's time on earth ran out. He
[1:37:31] didn't have time to pray for everyone.
[1:37:33] He didn't have time to reach everyone.
[1:37:36] But he showed us over and over what will
[1:37:38] work, what does work.
[1:37:42] It ain't faith in a man. Ain't even
[1:37:45] faith in a gift. It's faith in God's
[1:37:47] word.
[1:37:50] That God will perform what he said he
[1:37:52] would perform. God will do what he said
[1:37:55] he would do.
[1:37:57] God will move the mountains if you
[1:38:00] believe.
[1:38:01] God will open the seas. God will tear
[1:38:04] down the walls.
[1:38:06] God will set every captive free.
[1:38:09] He saw you bound down with that
[1:38:12] depression.
[1:38:14] He saw you in that anxiety.
[1:38:17] He saw you with those hormonal problems.
[1:38:19] He saw you with all the whatever issue
[1:38:21] you came to church with tonight. He saw
[1:38:24] you.
[1:38:27] Now, do you want to get well?
[1:38:33] Well, brother Timothy, I I ain't been
[1:38:35] prayed for. I I I ain't got nobody to
[1:38:37] take me to the water. That ain't what
[1:38:39] Jesus asked the man. He asked him, "Do
[1:38:41] you want to get well?"
[1:38:45] Then what did he tell him to do? There's
[1:38:47] an action you got to do. Rise up and
[1:38:50] walk.
[1:38:57] Rise up and walk.
[1:39:02] take up your bed and go home.
[1:39:09] Yes, Lord.
[1:39:13] Maybe you feel like this is my night
[1:39:16] or do you want to get well?
[1:39:20] You want to move past it? Rise up and
[1:39:23] walk.
[1:39:25] Leave it behind.
[1:39:29] Lord, I come to you
[1:39:32] to be changed, renewed.
[1:39:38] He's looking for your actions.
[1:39:43] God, change my speech.
[1:39:45] Lord, I always express my doubts, my
[1:39:47] fears, and my unbelief. But Lord, change
[1:39:50] my thoughts and my thinking and how I
[1:39:53] speak. I can just speak your word, Lord,
[1:39:55] and I can say yes.
[1:39:59] to all your promises.
[1:40:02] I can say yes, I believe. But it's more
[1:40:05] than just words.
[1:40:07] It's an action to it. Put it into action
[1:40:11] in my life.
[1:40:14] You notice he didn't tell that man to go
[1:40:16] get somebody else and pick up his bed
[1:40:17] and walk. He told that man to pick up
[1:40:20] his bed and walk.
[1:40:25] He told that man to rise.
[1:40:27] He told that woman to stomp her foot and
[1:40:30] walk off well.
[1:40:33] He's telling you tonight, "Rise and be
[1:40:37] healed. Rise and be delivered. Rise and
[1:40:41] be set free.
[1:40:43] Let God do his perfect work in you. And
[1:40:46] act upon his faith that's inside of you,
[1:40:52] Father.
[1:40:55] or just a little thought you put on my
[1:40:56] heart.
[1:40:58] I believe this is a year of action
[1:41:02] not resting upon our law laurels and
[1:41:05] well
[1:41:07] bride's going to be raptured dead in
[1:41:09] Christ is going to be going to rise.
[1:41:12] It's going to happen.
[1:41:14] Lord, the bride is making herself ready
[1:41:17] in anticipation and looking, believing,
[1:41:21] but not just believing, but acting upon
[1:41:23] your word,
[1:41:25] receiving what you promised,
[1:41:28] confessing you, Lord, to be the healer
[1:41:31] and deliverer.
[1:41:33] Oh God, there's so many voices that's
[1:41:35] going out in this world, in this land,
[1:41:37] even around message circles, Lord,
[1:41:39] claiming that you're not a God of
[1:41:41] miracles anymore. not no signs and no
[1:41:43] wonders, no no manifestations. Oh God,
[1:41:47] they can say what they want to say. They
[1:41:50] can believe what they want to believe.
[1:41:51] They can sit in their tents with their
[1:41:53] quotes and they can argue back and
[1:41:55] forth, but Lord, there's got to be
[1:41:56] somebody that's willing to face giants.
[1:41:59] There's willing has to be somebody
[1:42:01] that's willing to face the giant of
[1:42:03] cancer and the giant of unbelief and the
[1:42:05] giant of death and overcome it, Lord.
[1:42:09] Not not not be not die, Lord, but be
[1:42:11] changed in a moment, in a twinkling of
[1:42:13] an eye.
[1:42:15] Oh Jesus, help us, Lord, to be that
[1:42:18] bride that makes herself ready. Help us
[1:42:21] to be a church of action. Lord, not just
[1:42:24] believe only resting upon that, but
[1:42:26] Lord, more than just a belief,
[1:42:30] but there's a life inside of us that's
[1:42:32] demonstrating the very power and works
[1:42:35] of Almighty God.
[1:42:38] Oh God, bless your people tonight. Lord,
[1:42:40] you see those, Lord, responding in their
[1:42:42] faith. I ask God, you just show yourself
[1:42:45] so real to them that they'll never back
[1:42:47] up. They be begin to confess, I'm
[1:42:50] healed. I'm delivered. I'm set free.
[1:42:54] Oh God, it's over. It's finished.
[1:42:57] It's already done because you promised
[1:42:59] it.
[1:43:01] Lord, I want to stand on your promise
[1:43:04] in Jesus name.
[1:43:08] and touch the Lord
[1:43:12] as he
[1:43:14] go.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; How many wants to just reach out and
[1:43:16] touch him tonight?
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Reach out
[1:43:20] and touch the Lord.
[1:43:24] As he passes
[1:43:28] by,
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; you you will find
[1:43:32] he's not
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; he's not too busy.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, he heard your heart. Your heart
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; and he is passing
[1:43:45] by.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord.
[1:43:48] your needs to
[1:43:51] survive.
[1:43:54] Reach out
[1:43:56] and touch the Lord
[1:44:00] as he
[1:44:03] goes by.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, reach out. I'm reaching out to you,
[1:44:09] Jesus. Oh.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Oh. As he passes
[1:44:15] by.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, you'll find
[1:44:20] he's not too busy
[1:44:24] to hear
[1:44:32] by this moment.
[1:44:35] your needs to
[1:44:39] supply.
[1:44:41] Reach out
[1:44:43] and touch the Lord
[1:44:47] as he
[1:44:49] goes by.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, reach out
[1:44:55] and touch the Lord
[1:44:59] as he passes
[1:45:02] by.
[1:45:05] You'll find
[1:45:07] he's not too busy
[1:45:11] to hear your heart's cry.
[1:45:16] Glories passing by this moment.
[1:45:23] your knees to
[1:45:28] reach out
[1:45:31] and touch the Lord
[1:45:35] as he
[1:45:38] goes by.
[1:45:42] It is so sweet
[1:45:47] to trust in Jesus.
[1:45:52] just to take
[1:45:56] him back at his word.
[1:46:01] Just to rest
[1:46:05] upon
[1:46:07] his promise,
[1:46:10] just to know
[1:46:14] the savior, the Lord.
[1:46:19] Oh Jesus,
[1:46:22] Jesus.
[1:46:24] How I trust him.
[1:46:29] How I prove
[1:46:33] him more and more.
[1:46:37] And Jesus,
[1:46:40] Jesus,
[1:46:43] preious
[1:46:44] Jesus.
[1:46:47] Oh, for grace
[1:46:50] to trust.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so glad. Say, I'm so glad
[1:46:59] I learned to trust him.
[1:47:04] Preious
[1:47:06] Jesus.
[1:47:09] Oh savior friend
[1:47:12] and I know
[1:47:16] that thou
[1:47:19] art with me and will be with
[1:47:25] me to thee.
[1:47:29] And Jesus
[1:47:32] Jesus
[1:47:34] how I trust him. How I prove
[1:47:42] him all and
[1:47:47] Jesus.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Oh preious
[1:47:53] Jesus.
[1:47:55] Oh for grace
[1:47:59] to trust.
[1:48:01] Oh see it again. Say Jesus,
[1:48:06] Jesus,
[1:48:08] how I trust him. How
[1:48:14] I prove
[1:48:16] him more
[1:48:18] and more
[1:48:20] in Jesus.
[1:48:23] Jesus,
[1:48:25] preious.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Oh, for grace
[1:48:32] to trust
[1:48:35] him more.
[1:48:40] I know who I am.
[1:48:45] Cuz I know who you are.
[1:48:51] The cross of salvation
[1:48:56] was only a start.
[1:49:02] And now I am chosen.
