Remember brother James Hollis having cataract surgery on Wednesday. As for prayer also uh Sister Felicia Liddell's dad is sick, very sick in the hospital. They're with him this morning. Remember them today. Also want to pray for sister Loretta. She's home from the hospital but still needs help getting around. Needs complete healing. So just ask the Lord to touch her. Also remember the Joe Adams is the way preaching this today. And so ask the Lord to be in her service and to minister the needs there. Ask brother Aaron if he'd come and pray over these prayer requests. Let's just pray together for these needs. Amen. Let's bow our heads together. Our gracious heavenly father, Lord, we just enter into your presence this morning humbly. Lord, recognizing today, Lord, that your word cannot fail and that your word promised that you would be here in our midst, Lord. You said that where two or three gather, you would be there. And we're coming today trusting that, Lord. And we can trust that. We can trust every part of your word, Lord. Your word said you'd never leave us or forsake us. Your word, Lord, said that you were the healer. By your stripes, we are healed. It says that you are the same yesterday, today, and forever. Lord, we praise you today, Lord, and we thank you and we stand upon that solid rock, Lord. As we heard our brother Timothy minister on Wednesday, it's a solid, sure foundation. It will not be shaken, Lord. So, we just thank you today that we have that rock to stand upon, Lord. We read in the scripture where the rock followed them in the wilderness. So it doesn't matter what situation we're in, how dark our day is, how dismal it is, and Lord, how dry it may seem. There's water and the rock is right there with us today. And we just want to say thank you, Lord. We've come to praise your name and lift you up, Lord. Cuz yours truly is the name above all names. It's the only name that deserves worship and praise and glory and honor, Lord. I pray today as we lift up your name that it'll please you, Lord, and that your spirit will just begin to move in this place. It'll deal with hearts and deal with lives, Lord. Lord, regardless of where we find ourselves today, every one of us need more of you. Every one of us need a refilling of the spirit. Every one of us need to draw closer. So our prayer today, Lord, is draw us closer to you today, Lord. Lord, that we can truly fulfill your will in our lives, Lord, and lay aside our ideas and our stubbornness and just come subject to you today, Father. Lord, you saw every need and heard everyone read across this desk, Sister Loretta and Sister Felicia's dad. And Lord, I just pray that you'll heal her sister and and touch Sister Felicia's father and sister Linda Buts and the pain she's in. Lord, Lord, you knew each one and you died on Calvary and took stripes, Lord. Lord, for our healing, Lord, our salvation, Lord, for all of it. And we come and just, Lord, ask you to move and be with our our brother Hollis, Lord, as he has this surgery and see him through it, Lord. Lord, I pray, Lord, every other need gathered here today. Lord, I know deep in the heart of of these men and women, there's there's needs, there's situations, and Father, I'm just asking that you minister to them today. Speak directly today by your word so there be no question, no doubt, Lord, that it's you moving on their behalf. Lord, we commit this time to you. I just ask that Lord, you'll anoint our brother Tim to speak today that he can step aside and allow the Holy Spirit to use him. Lord, I pray you'll anoint every one of us. Lord, may we Lord, get give worship today from an anointed life and a filled heart and a heart that recognizes, Lord, how much we have to be thankful for because you have been so good to us, Father. And we just want to say thank you. We love you. We invite you into this service now. Lord, we ask you to have your way in this service and and there with brother Joe where he's ministering. May you have your way there as well. Use him in a mighty way. Father, we look to you now. We ask you to move and that you alone receive glory today from this service. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Won't you turn around, shake one of his hand, welcome each other to the house of the Lord. We have some visitors here today. We want to make you welcome. God bless you. Glad you could be with us today. And Amen. May you just feel the presence of the Lord. Amen. I'm redeemed by love divine. Glory. Glory. Christ is mine.

When the morning comes, when all the saints gather together home, we will tell the story how we overcome better by [Music] break out a old one if we can remember. We are always facing battles and it's hard to keep the pace cuz Satan never lets up in his fight for winning place. But I have the Lord to guide you every step along the way. So when Satan comes against me, you will always hear me say, "That's no heel for a climber. It's no battle for a child of God. Satan's already been defeated and the victoryy's been won. Jesus won the fight on Calvary when he died for you and me. So now Satan, get behind me. For I claim the victory. Every time I try to do a little something for the Lord, Satan tries to block my path and keep me from my goals. But I don't care how high the heels seem to be today. I'll take my Savior by the hand and he'll help me when I say, "Oh, that's no heel for a climb. No battle for a child of God. Satan's already been defeated and the victories been won. Jesus won the fight on Calvary when he died for you and me. So now Satan, get behind me for I claim the victory. And that's no heel for a climber. It's no battle for a child of God. Satan's already been defeated and the victory's been won. Jesus won the fight on Calvary when he died for you and me. So now Satan, get behind me for I claim the victory. So now Satan, get behind me for I claim the victory. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. How many's claiming the victory this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen.

As we go to prayer this morning, I want all the young people that are going to be going to Ohio camp and they got meetings there coming up this weekend to be traveling. We didn't get a wasn't able to get a bus this year for them all to go in. So, they're going individually. I want you to step out of your seat. Won't you stand right up here in the front and let me pray with you? You won't be here Wednesday night and so we'll just have a moment of prayer. We're very proud of our young people, those of you that are going, those that can't go. And I know there's some of you that will not be able to go, but you know, the Lord will provide and be with you and every step of the way. I believe these meetings will be lifechanging for many and uh bring deliverance, salvation, and a closer walk with God. Amen. So that is the whole motive for meetings like this that we might draw nearer to the Lord. So let's pray. Father, in the name of Jesus, we want to say thank you for your blessings to us. We want to say thank you for this service, for this time of of worship where we can come and praise the name of our creator and savior where you left all of glory and became one of us, Lord, and paid the price of redemption. Thank you, Lord. Thank you for these young people that you've entrusted us with. Those that are here that, oh God, that will remain here. those that will be able to travel. Lord, I I pray that you'll be with those on their journey. May your hand of grace be upon them. I ask for the power of the Holy Spirit to move in the meetings ahead. Lord, not only there, but here at home and let your Holy Spirit just reign supreme for every need. And oh God, let our young people here be a light and a testimony to others and show forth the evening light as we love you and we give you praise and glory in Jesus' name. Thank you now for the word today. I pray that you'll bless it to our hearts and you anoint it to our lives. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. It's good to be in the house of the Lord today. We pray God's blessings upon each one of you and it's a very special way and he'll speak to you and in a very real and living way today and manifest his glory in your life. Amen. And as you remain standing now for the reading of the word, we want to just um read a couple of scriptures. First of all, we're going to be speaking today. Um if you can get my my um keynote up. Today we're going to be speaking on um the mountain movers. We're here in the age of Leoda. It is the bride age. &gt;&gt; It is the age where the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost. And we're not speaking of Isuza Street there. We're talking about the original Pentecost. Amen. And so we um as we are looking at that, we're going to be speaking on our theme that we've been on on the mountain movers. We're in Zechariah 4:7. It says, "Who art thou, oh great mountain? Thou shalt become a plain, and the headstone shall be brought forth with shoutings, crying, grace, grace unto it." and and I believe we're in the days of the great capstone, the coming of the Lord Jesus where we will meet him in the air. He'll cap off the church um and and finish it off. And I believe we're some of the finishing stones that are being added to to the building to the kingdom that he has. Now this morning we're going to be reading from Revelation chapter 3 and verse 18 where he said I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raignment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with thyself that thou mayest see. As many as I love I rebuke and chasten. Be zealous therefore and repent. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him and will s with him and he with me. To him that overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me in my throne. Even as I also overcame, and am sat down with my father in his throne. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. Amen. God bless you. You can be seated. May the Lord add his blessings to the reading of his word and here we are today and it's already August. God's blessed us with a couple of days of of cooler weather and we're thankful for that. We have a wonderful day ahead of us with a communion service to follow this and foot washing for those that will participate in this. Now we, you know, we um combined two services into one. So the service today will be a little longer uh and a little bit more lengthy than maybe some are accustomed to, but you know we do this um many travel in from different places. We have we have some folks right here that travel up three three and a half hours all the way from down in South Texas to be with us today and and here regularly. So, you know, they come a long ways and and um they expect to get a full meal while they're here. Amen. So, we appreciate the Wiggins family coming up and not only them but many others that are here that come in from different places. We're made up from all from Arkansas that drives in here all the way from you know, Bojer, Shreport, Homer, Mendon all the way down in different other parts of Louisiana. So we just want you just to enter in today and receive from the Lord. We have um you know something very special I want to make mention of. We have um today um another family has been added to the church and uh we have brother Joe and sister Stephanie Green that have moved here from Oklahoma and we want to welcome them to our assembly today and pray that God will bless them as they journey towards us toward the or with us toward the rapture. Amen. Will you stand brother Joe, sister Stephanie, so everybody can see you. Amen. We welcome you today in the name of the Lord. Praise the Lord. Amen. God bless you. Amen. It's great to be in the house of the Lord. See the von Brontton's here all the way from Belgium still with us today. So, you know, I think they're plan on traveling on um from today, but they've been in the area for a week or so. And so, we're just been happy to to to have them have fellowship with them. We got to hear a little bit about their conversion and what God did and his glorious deliverance. And um we're you know part of it was climatic when brother Timothy was there ministering um in in the Belgium youth camp and he was there in those services and God gloriously saved him and delivered him from a life of of alcohol when their marriage was on the brink of of divorce and God rich in mercy turned their lives around. Now, if he'll do it for them, Amen. If you got loved ones out there, he'll do it for them, too. &gt;&gt; He's a God rich in mercy. Amen. And I'm glad to know that he's still saving. He's still delivering. And he's still setting people free. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, today as we go into the word, you know, I I you know, there are a lot of things as we minister and uh kind of feel led on our heart to do. And yet sometimes we kind of secondguess ourselves and and um you know uh maybe sometimes uh wonder why the Lord is leading us this way and and if it's really something that is pertinent and important because we just don't want to waste time. We want to really put um our efforts into these last few hours that we have. And um and so I I just received a a um an a text today, a WhatsApp t from from South Africa, one of the pastors there that has a little group there in South Africa and he was just um you know encouraging me today to bring these things forth. He said in last Sunday's service toward the end you made us write you made this remark and asked us to write it down. spiritual truths must never be used to cancel out literal promises. And he said, "This is still lingering with me because this is what we have been taught by ministers. It's caused us problems to live and to live below our God-given rights." And it was it's so profound and been such a liberating thought. And you know it's for reasons like this that we do this is is to take the chains off. Amen. To enlighten us to where we are and and encourage us to take our inheritance. Now I have read from this um um today where we read from Revelation chapter 3 concerning the Leodysian church. Now, we believe that this is more than just seven churches over in Asia, but this was symbolic as the book of Revelation is symbolic of um of of things that would happen in the end time. Now, God could not tell them, "It'll be 2,000 years or seven Gentile church ages before I come back because he had it in he had to to know that Satan would get a hold of that and would do great damage with it." So, he would do damage with it by causing every age to be um lazy and lethargic and and not uh ready for his coming. So he wanted every age, you know, fulfilling his words that Jesus said about his coming. Most common words he uses about the rapture is watch. So he wanted everybody on a state of watchfulness. Now if people go down prepared in their age, whether it be the Ephesians or the Smyrnian or Sardis or Philadelphiaian or or even here in the Leodysian age, if they go down ready, they're going to come up ready, &gt;&gt; right? prepared to meet the Lord. And so this is uh very very important. Now, as we're speaking of that, I'm going to be titling this Leoa, the bride age. Now to some this is going to be incredulous because if had we read the whole message to this church age which we did last Sunday um that we would have read how that Christ was on the outside of the church. He wasn't even on the inside. He was already been pushed out by the religious systems and he was knocking on the doors and then he was given an invitation. If any man hear my voice and will open the door, I will come in and s with him and he with me. So it wasn't that mercy was over, but now God was now through with the denominational system. He would no longer send another revival to them. and and another reformation for them to go and continue on in organized religion. He would call out and pride a people for his name. And so when we look at this, you know, there that is described as wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked. Now that would be the the spiritual condition of the church in the last age. And that's where we are is in the last age. And so you so to call this the bride age you you would question and say well then how could anyone call Leodysia that Christ rejecting lukewarm church the bride age and and because that is certainly not a description of the bride. The bride is without spot or wrinkle or blemish or any such thing. But it is an accurate description of the false vine. And that Christ rejecting system as described in Revelation 3 is not the bride. &gt;&gt; You see, it is the shuck or it is the outer husk that once served its purpose. But the but in the end it releases the grain. It it had the form of life for a season. You see, but it refused the continuation of the word. And in doing so, it rejects Christ himself. And what does the Lord say of her? Because you are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I will spew you out of my mouth. Now that word spew actually means to vomit. It's a graphic and final expression of divine disgust and rejection. There are no words in the scripture that are more that more bitterly denounce a people who arrogantly claimed Christ while denying his present truth. And so this is not the bride, but all of Leodosa, not all of Leodosa has rejected him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we must not miss on this important truth that that not all within Leodosa rejects Christ. That there's somebody, as brother Phil sang this morning, going to be victorious. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's somebody going to be an overcomer. So you see, even in the darkest hour, you see there's a remnant that hears his voice. Behold, at the I stand at the door and I knock. And if any man hear my voice and will open the door, I will come into him and suck with him and he with me. So no, the door of mercy is not closed. Amen. I I want to get this, you know, because even as brother Brandham says in one of his last sermons, one of his very last sermons, I think today the hearts are becoming stony, filled with the world, indifferent church members, lukewarm like the rich young ruler, and don't know that the great Holy Spirit is standing knocking at the door in this Leodysian age. He that will hear my voice, the word, and will open his heart, I will come into him and will s with him. So, you know, this shows us several things. It shows us first the door of mercy is still open. &gt;&gt; Amen. Secondly, it shows us where he's at. He's still standing in the Leodysian age knocking. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this is this is where he is because this is the last sermon now before the communion service that he had just before he departs. And he's he and he's humming as he as he says these words he's actually humming the invitation song just as I am. And and what does it tell us again? Door of mercy is open. The Holy Spirit is still here. And three, there are people in this age within Leodysia who does not conform to the lukewarm spirit. &gt;&gt; They answer his knock. They receive his counsel. They they are the they receive of the gold tried in the fire. They are w receive white raignnt. Amen. And isab so they can see. and they commune with him in intimacy. These are the overcomers and they are the bride. Now the terrors who are maturing very fast today under corrupt teachers and and they are already turning people away from the word and and of course this continues right on to this day. But the wheat also must mature. I want you to understand the age produces two people. &gt;&gt; Amen. It produces tears and it produces wheat. &gt;&gt; The grain that will be taken into the garner. Now, so again, the the wheat must also mature. And to her, God has sent a prophet messenger with a vindicated message and ministry that he might be accepted by the elect. And they will hear him as the first word. First church heard Paul and will m she will mature in the word until becoming a word bride and the mighty works will be found in her that are always attended upon the pure word and faith. So you see the bride age is an era of time within this leodyian age. The bride in this age is, you know, is is until the until the consummation, until the finishing of the age, she is its light. She is the flame of its lampstand. And she is absolutely not of this present darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, now the bride age as we speak about is not a new age apart from Leodysia. Now, if that was true, we would need another angel messenger. And and the scripture only gives us seven, &gt;&gt; right? Seven. And so, as seven, you see, are um speaks of seven lampstands and seven flames of fire and seven stars to the seven ages. And those stars were the angel messengers in his hand to reveal his word for the age. Are you with me? And so there are only when we get a picture of the lamb in Revelation 5, there are only seven horns on the lamb and it has seven eyes. So there's not another age to come there. We are in the last age. &gt;&gt; We have come to the climax. And I want you to understand that that the bride age is the climax of Leodysia, &gt;&gt; the weak coming to full maturity and being separated from the shock. &gt;&gt; Now, so this is where we are. To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne. You see, somebody somebody is going to be raptured in this hour. Now, of course, these words were not spoken to Isuza Street or to the early Westlands or even to the shack of Pentecost. They were spoken to the final overcomers, the bride of this age that are triumphant. They are exalted to the throne of God with the highest honor ever conferred upon any group of people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So you see though there are there are those that will go into chaos. They will go into the tribulation and face the wrath of God. But yet I I want you to understand the bride of Christ does not end in failure but in a raptured victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. So yeah the nominal church ends in apostasy. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the true church, the bride does not end in defeat. &gt;&gt; Amen. She is raptured, glorified, and enthroned. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So this is this bride age then is the capstone of the ages. It's what God wanted to produce when he said, "I will build a church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it." So you see here again the seven ages end with the coronation of the bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The selecting of a queen &gt;&gt; and the crowning. Hallelujah. This is a crowning moment that all ages have been looking for. And you have been called to the marriage supper of the lamb. &gt;&gt; What an age that we are living in. So you see you see the this is where the grain returns to the original word. This is the last call and the spirit and the bride speak the same thing saying come. Amen. And the false vine of course will be spewed out. The true vine will be caught up. And as the Bible said they that were ready went within with him to the marriage and the door was shut. Amen. Now, as we as we look at this, I want you to understand of the false vine, it is said that no words ever spelled out a more bitter denunciation, and no proud and arrogant religious people ever deserved it more. Now, that's said of this age. but of the true vine which is also said of this age that we we find the true vine, the true spirit, the true church people exalted to the very throne of God with the highest compliment ever paid to humble steadfast spiritual group. &gt;&gt; Amen. One gets a bitter denunciation that because God is sickened by him. &gt;&gt; He is sickened by religion without a true experience. &gt;&gt; He is sickened with a with a because of confession without a poss possession. Are you with me? He is sickened by just lukewarm membership. &gt;&gt; Amen. He spews them out of his mouth and said they don't speak for me. But at the same time in the same age to the bride age he says he says that that we find the true vine the true spirit true church people exalted to the very throne of God. The highest compliment ever given or paid to a humble group of people. My goodness, church, that ought to put something in you this morning. Cause you to lift your head up high and re and receive a compliment. &gt;&gt; This is what he said to me. Amen. He He ex He is exalting me to have dominion. &gt;&gt; What does he take you when you were a sinner and and he saved you from sin? He exalted you. to have dominion. &gt;&gt; To have dominion over cigarettes and alcohol and and and sex spirits and and and anger and every kind of other thing that you had in your life and and broke the family trees of your past. Amen. And there made you put you in a position, exalted you to a place of dominion where that Satan is under your feet. Hallelujah. Now, so this is the highest honor ever paid to a group of people ever promised to sit with him on his throne. Notice, not beside him, not under him, but with him, &gt;&gt; sharing his dominion. &gt;&gt; Amen. His authority, his eternal victory. And this promise is not made to every churchgoer. Even if you go here, it's not made to every church go to evening like tabernacle. It's not it's not given to the casual believer or to the lukewarm professor. It is given to the overcomer. &gt;&gt; So what am I telling you? Take your sword and fight &gt;&gt; against the lukewarm spirit of the age. &gt;&gt; Amen. that would just want to make you a cold formal Christian &gt;&gt; and not fervent and on and on fire for God. &gt;&gt; Now, so you see this is again not the reward of the other ages. Amen. Although there will be a bride out of every age. I'm not discounting them. I'm talking about those that are here churches, grandchildren and great grandchildren of previous movements. You see though that movement was once filled with God's life and played a role even they like the Isuza movement you know it it played a role in restoring the gifts but it was just another stage of the wheat plant. It was the sh it was a stage in the maturing process and and in the end it becomes dead and dry and without life. the life that was there moved out into the grain. &gt;&gt; So the promise is for the grain, the elect, the wordborn bride, those who have come all the way to the full maturity of the word in this last hour. So yeah, we call this the bride age, but not as a separate dispensation. It is not a new church age that requires a new messenger. No, the the the bride age is the prophetic fulfillment and the climatic conclusion of the Leodysian age. It is the portion of Leodysa where the wheat or the grain is separated from the chaff. Now Jesus promised and in fact if you go back and you look at the first forerunner in the Bible that would forerrun and he said when when when Christ come when the Messiah would come what would he do? He would thoroughly purge his floor. Then he would separate the chaff from the grain. And he would take the grain into the garner and the rest would be burned with unquenchable fire. &gt;&gt; Right? Now remember again, you know, it's fire that cannot be quenched because in the tribulation period, they go through the purging of the tribulation that wind up at the great white throne. Judgment there just for the deeds done in their body. Not all of them are lost. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the great grace that we've received in this day is to know that not all of them that are lost. &gt;&gt; Amen. There are many of them will be purged in the tribulation hour. But not the bride. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because you have been accounted worthy to stand before the son of man, the word, and be judged by that word and judged now by that word. separated from the sin of unbelief of the prior ages. Come on, somebody help me preach now. Amen. And you have stood before the word and he has discerned your heart. He has judged you. He has separated the unbelief from you and he makes you without spot or wrinkle or blemish or any such thing. A rapture ready people prepared for the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I look into the mirror of that and I say, "Mama, that's me." &gt;&gt; Right? Amen. So you see we are the prophetic fulfillment the climatic uh conclusion of the Leodysian age where the wheat is separated from the chaff where the bride breaks free from denominational systems and steps into her prophetic identity. A chosen people a pure virgin prepared to meet the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we've come, the church has come through Luther's justification. That was a move of God. Through Wesley's sanctification, that was a move of God. Through the Isuza Street, the Pentecostal and their gifts. But now she is to return to the original Pentecostal life and power, not in part, but in fullness. You see, the church began as a bride, spotless. This is how she began. Her beginnings on the day of Pentecost was a spotless bride, full of the Holy Ghost, rapture ready. &gt;&gt; And now in this last portion of time, she returns to what she was. It's like planting a grain and you end up with grain. in between is the life that passed through, but it wasn't the grain. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's only harvested or raptured when it returns back to grain form again. Now, so because he made a promise and listen church, when I get discouraged, I go right here to this promise. When I look around and I see people fail and failures around me, I look at his promise. He said, "I will present to myself a glorious church, not having a spot or wrinkle or any such thing." &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I don't know, sometimes don't know how God's going to do it. But I'll tell you, the capstone is called coming crying grace, grace, &gt;&gt; the favor of God, the double favor of God to a people of this last day because God will not be defeated. He will have a people, a bride in his image. &gt;&gt; There be a people return right back to the faith of the fathers. Now, I want to review this quote right here. The whole of the gent of the church ages is God dealing with the Gentiles and calling out a gentile bride to himself. And that makes the church ages and the fullness of the Gentiles a one and the same thing. So it is the bride age when the Gentiles reach their fullness. All right. Now again as we look at this I want to to establish that when the last member now remember this this book this seventh sealed book that God had that the lamb had. It had names in it. And when that last name is manifest on earth, &gt;&gt; and that person has been dipped in blood, &gt;&gt; filled with the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; are you with me? And is added to the body, then the rapture comes. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's why we're interested in outreach. &gt;&gt; That's why we're interested in youth meetings. &gt;&gt; That's why we're interested in old people's meetings. Because there's many people that have sat on the pew for years and years and years who have not been recognized in that book. &gt;&gt; Their name may be there, but it hadn't been recognized yet. They hadn't been dipped in blood. Now, so the when the last one comes in, the rapture will come. Now each age has received a portion of the word and the spirit but in the last notice fullness of the Gentiles. This is actually from Romans um is it 9 or 12? But anyway it's the book of Romans. And and the fullness of the Gentiles, I want you to get it. That when the fullness of the Gentiles comes is not that they just simply, you know, the last one is saved, but also when the word at and the spirit at last comes to its full measure. So he said in the last days, the last 2,000 years, I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh. &gt;&gt; This is the day he empties it out. &gt;&gt; Each other age got a portion. They got a dip of the spirit, you know, a little bit of the spirit. Luther had it. Wesley had it. That was the Holy Ghost moving in those ages, but not in the fullness that it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not in the fullness. Just in the in the in the in the in the first early stages of justification or sanctification, same thing. Restoration of gifts, more of the spirit poured out. It was the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. But now God comes to pour out his fullness &gt;&gt; in the last church age. And the bride leaving here will not leave here a weak a disbelieving unbelieving group of people but a people who are full of faith full of power full of the Holy Ghost baptized aresh having a new and upto-ate experience not dependent on yesterday's &gt;&gt; but alive &gt;&gt; not a dead church but a living church &gt;&gt; now so the entire span of the church ages is God's redemptive work among the Gentiles. Ever since that Israel stumbled at that stumbling stone, you find in in Romans 11 that God turned to Gentiles to call out a people for his name. That's Acts 15:14. And that means the church ages and the fullness of the gentiles are not two separate events or dispensation. They are they are one and the same prophetic timeline. Now this is the bride age al which is also called bride time is the final phase within le oysia which we're here at the very end of the age when the gentile bride receive reaches her completion her fullness when the last predestimated member is washed in the blood of the lamb filled with the holy y sealed in the body of Christ and then the rapture takes takes place and that's when the gentile dispensation closes and God turns back to Israel. That's when the church ages close. You see, throughout the seven ages, each generation, as we've said, has more uh received a portion of the word in the spirit. But in this final moment, the bride receives the full measure. Amen. Not just a portion but the fullness of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Matched by the fullness of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Now in this union the revealed word joined with the indwelling spirit. It produces a people who will not see death but will be changed in a moment and twinkling of an eye and be translated just like Enoch was &gt;&gt; into the very presence of Christ. Oh, I hope you're ready for it because we're right here on the cusp of the rapture. I want to just bring you right now to what the Apostle Paul said in Romans 11:25. Paul would write and he says for I would not brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery and that the blindness in this in part is happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles come in. So they will be blind. They will not recognize their Messiah until the fullness of the Gentiles come in. Now, this statement draws a prophetic boundary around the church ages. You see, Israel as a nation was temporarily set aside. If you read Romans chapter nine, and that'd be good homework for you to do. Read your Bible. Romans chapter nine, the Bible tells you that she she was set aside. She was actually cut off because she stumbled over the stone Jesus Christ and he was the rejected cornerstone. All right. So again, as we look here the next we're going to Romans nine. But Israel which followed not after or which followed after the law of righteousness had not attained to the law of righteousness. Wherefore, because they sought it not by faith, but as it were, by the works of the law, for they stumbled at that stumbling stone. And it is written, "Behold, I lay in Zion." Look, Zion represents the church. It represents Israel. Israel is our natural the natural church. The the church is the spiritual church. I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and a rock of offense, and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. Now, as brother Timothy brought that out Wednesday night, will not be twisted, will will not be like a rope that's in a mass of tangles. He that believeth on him, you know, the mysteries of God will be made known, the truth, the revelation. So you see her blindness, the blindness of Israel opened the door for the Gentiles. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Who were like wild olive branches. Now this is the way it's described in Romans chapter 11. And they were like wild olive branches and they were grafted into the root of God's covenant. And the church ages are the times of the Gentile. And God does not deal with the Gentiles for redemption purposes outside of these seven ages. So the seven church ages found in Revelation 2 and three are God's specific dealings with the gentile bride. But the season is not indefinite. It comes to an end. Right? There is, let me just tell you, there is a divine countdown that is ticking &gt;&gt; because what did it say? Until the fullness of the Gentiles come in. &gt;&gt; So that is a divine countdown. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, it wasn't so in the first stage. Wasn't so in the second age. It wasn't that close in the third. But the further we get to it, the closer we get. And we're right here. &gt;&gt; Ju come on, church. I mean, ju just like our nation is and and the and the world today. The atomic clock says that we're 3 minutes to midnight and now they moved it over to just seconds before midnight. And here we're right here on the verge of nuclear destruction. And you say, "Oh, it can't happen." The Bible said it would. The it will burn with a fervent heat. &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. Malachi 4 said we'll walk out on the ashes of the wicked. &gt;&gt; It'll burn with unquenchable fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. Th this is this is where we are at. &gt;&gt; And just like the the the the clock is ticking right down to the midnight hour. Even so, there's another clock that is going on that we can look at right now. And it's called the fullness of the Gentile. And we are nearer now than any other age has ever been because we are here in the last age at the very end of it. &gt;&gt; So you see this divine countdown is ticking and that is when the last predestinated gentile soul is baptized into the body of Christ. Then the bride will be complete and the rapture will take place. Now at that moment, at that moment, just as Israel was cut off because of unbelief, so will the Gentile nations be cut off. Why? For the same reason. They have rejected the headstone. Christ is on the outside of the church, right? Amen. Because they rejected the capstone or the headstone, the final revelation of Jesus Christ, the very capstone of the gentile dispensation. Now Jesus said this even in his day because this is what Israel did. And Jesus in Matthew 21:42 said, "The stone which the builders rejected, the same has become the head of the corner." &gt;&gt; So the very one that they rejected, the Jews became the head of the corner and he became the foundation stone which the church is built upon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because as Paul said, no other foundation can any of man lay other than Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Is that right? So you see Zachchariah prophesied also that we read at the beginning you know he prophesied that the capstone the finishing stone will come with a shout. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; With a shout and and that shout is a message. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do do you realize even the coming of the Lord is with is in stages of shout voice and trump. It begins with a shout, a message &gt;&gt; to turn our hearts back to the original faith. &gt;&gt; And it comes crying, shouting. Oh my. It's not weeping. It's shouting. It's a shout. This is And it's crying grace. Grace, &gt;&gt; brother. If we ever need a grace, it's this. It's this hour that needs grace. We not only need a rapture in faith, we need a rapturing grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it comes with such grace that in the most wicked evil age where Satan's Eden is all around you and where Satan is the god of this evil of this evil age, it comes with such grace that a bride is raptured out of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You think back over with Eve, you know, they couldn't keep one word of God and they were in a perfect Eden. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. In a perfect Eden and Satan deceived her. But here in this last day, the second Eve is coming forth and she will not be deceived. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She's walking right back into Eden again. Right back into the kingdom, right back in the full power of the Holy Ghost, going in a rapture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As I concluded last Sunday, who is that I see leaning on the arm of her beloved? &gt;&gt; Not a defeated church, a redeemed church, &gt;&gt; an overcoming church. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I'm struggling." Brother Tim, you are an overcomer. You can't overcome it without struggling against it. Fight against it. Resist the devil. He'll flee from you. You were predestined for this moment. You were called and ordained for this very hour. &gt;&gt; As he said about Esther, for this moment have you come into the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now I want to just go for a moment and I just want to speak about it just a moment. And all we all know what happened in our generation. We know when you know when when brother Brandham for example received the the vision of the coming of the seven angels and they were to reveal the seven thunders of Revelation 10. Those voices of thunders revealed the mysterious symbols contained in the seven seals. It was not something outside the Bible. It's something written in the Bible. But as Jesus said, I speak in parables. And he wrote the whole book of Revelation in symbolic terms. And it couldn't be revealed by theologians. It would take a prophet. &gt;&gt; And so as we as we see this happen, you know, in doing so, these seven angelic messengers came from glory to reveal these mysteries. And these seven angels swept Brother Brandham up into the vision. And as it concluded, as it concluded, he was left sitting in the corner of his room reading his Bible. Now, I want to go to this right quick, and I'll just give you the reference. This is this is this a sign of the insurers. I found myself over in a corner. I could hear my wife somewhere trying to shake the door. The door in the bedroom was locked. I had a Bible open. I was reading. I don't know what but it was in I believe Romans 9th chapter the last verse. Behold I lay in Zion a cornerstone a stumbling stone a precious stone. And whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. And I thought it's strange I'd be reading that. The spirit's still packing me in the room. And I I closed up the Bible and stood there and I went over the window. It was about 10 o'clock in the day or better. I raised up my hands and I said, "Oh," I said, "Lord God, I don't understand. This is a strange day to me and I'm beside myself almost." And I said, "Lord, what does that mean? Let me read it again if it let me read it again if it be you." Now, sounds juvenile, but I took up the Bible and just flipped it open. And it was there again. Same place. Paul telling the Jews try tell the Romans that the Jews tried to accept it by works but it's by faith that we believe it. Now I this this is a very very important thing that we understand because history repeats itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just as the Jews rejected the outpour of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost, turning away from the living Christ for tradition and for their temple worship, the Gentile in this final age repeats the same era. She becomes entangled in religious systems in in with lukewarm and rich in goods and yet fiercely bankrupt. You see, just as the Jews were blinded to the first coming of the word made flesh, the Gentiles stumble over the capstone revelation. &gt;&gt; The word again made manifest in bride form. &gt;&gt; So, I want you to get it. Remember, there's seven mighty angels that came in this that caught him up in this constellation of of themselves and told him to go back to the east and and preach and reveal those seven seals that are there in the book of Revelation. Now, we know they're revealed by the lamb, but there has to be somebody on earth that receives it, &gt;&gt; right? So you you see as he as he receives this climatic vision and and I don't have time to go into all the symbolics symbols of it and and and share with you the whole event but just catch the the the top of it when when here the angels came and here he's now left by the departure of the angels reading the scripture. And the scripture is that he's reading is Romans chapter nine where that the Jews had received Christ and rejected him. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And they stumbled at that stumbling stone. And it shows now the Gentiles will do the same thing. Revelation 3 shows you they will &gt;&gt; outside his own church &gt;&gt; knocking &gt;&gt; rejected. &gt;&gt; Oh, they're still singing about him. They're still going through church motions, but they have neglected the word. &gt;&gt; They've turned him down. &gt;&gt; And when the Gentiles reject the final move of the spirit, the call and the ceiling and the adoption of the bride, God turns back to Israel. That's where we're at. That's when the two prophets of Revelation 11 will appear. That's when the 144,000 will be sealed in of the remnant of the Jews. And that's when the bride will have already been taken in the flight and the glory. So, as we're talking about this fullness of the Gentiles, it's not about just numbers. It's about rightness and readiness and revelation. Because once the grain is matured and the shuck has served its purpose, the sickle is thrust in &gt;&gt; and the harvest is taken and a bride goes into the garner. &gt;&gt; A rapture ready people. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when the times of the Gentiles reach their climax, then history repeats itself and they reject their Just as Israel stumbled over their stumbling stone, over the cornerstone, rejected Christ as his first coming. So the gentile church stumbles at the return of the headstone. Now hold this thought. He is the author and finisher of our faith. &gt;&gt; So he was the cornerstone and he's the capstone. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so again, it's in our day that the headstone comes. Now, it's it's it's in our time that the word comes to cap off the ages. It's it's the same cry that was rejected before is now repeated. Grace, grace to it. And it was grace when he came to Israel. How many believes that was his grace? walking on the shores of Galilee bringing the gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. And his grace now in this hour of restoration. &gt;&gt; But when but the church, the Leoian church is blind just like Israel, wretched, naked, and does not know it. and she puts Christ on the outside shutting the door on the final light of the final age. &gt;&gt; Now, so the Gentiles are now repeating the era of the Jews. &gt;&gt; They have having received the early and the latter reign. They now reject the capstone which is the full revelation of Christ and his word. Because of this rejection, God cuts off the Gentiles and the gospel turns back to the Jews. We're right here in a transition moment. But in that moment when God turns from the Gentiles, he has a remnant. &gt;&gt; For even within the failing Leodysian age, there is an overcoming bride. a people who hear the knock, open the door, and receive the word in its fullness. &gt;&gt; And they are those that are called out by the message of the seventh angel. Revelation 10:7 says, "In the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall sound his message, the mystery of God will be finished." And they are called out to receive the token of his life. And they're raptured to sit with Christ. They are separated from the shock. They are gathered into the garner and they do not stumble but they receive the headstone. &gt;&gt; Some stumble at it. &gt;&gt; Others receive it. And because of this they do not face judgment but enter to glory with their bridegroom. &gt;&gt; So the bride age or bride time is within le oysia. So yeah, right here in this last age, there is an elect lady. She rises within the age and her emergence marks this as the bride age. But let us be clear, it's not a a separate dispensation from Leodysia. If it were, it would require as I said another messenger. And and and scripture and prophecy make no such provision for that. So but the bride age rather is the climax is the ripened fulfillment of Leodysia itself. Now the age began with great potential. &gt;&gt; It did. &gt;&gt; It opened with powerful &gt;&gt; stirrings of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; of the Zuza Street Pentecostal revival. It was it was a move of God. Don't ever think it wasn't. &gt;&gt; That was God back there. That was him working among his people. It was a move of God that brought a further light than what the Methodists had. &gt;&gt; It was a past It was another move past sanctification. It was a baptism of the Holy Ghost being poured out. It was a move of God that brought it into a further stage of the wheat plant, the shuck stage, close in form, but yet not the grain itself. That was a glorious phase. But let me just say it this way. It was still immature adolescence. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Now in this final portion of Leodysa, the shuck is peeled back and the grain, the true bride emerges. She is mature, ripened and ready for the garner. So the last of this age is the bride age where the wheat sown in tears returns in joy, ready for the harvest. It's the climax of all church history. You're what every one of them were prophesying of and pointed to. &gt;&gt; You would be justified like the Lutherans, sanctified like the Westlands. &gt;&gt; Have the gifts of the spirit like the Isuza Street. &gt;&gt; Amen. But even more, the bride age is not just the end of Leodysia. It's the crown, the culmination of all the ages. It is the final product of the gospel seed planted at Pentecost 2,000 years ago. Think of that. From Luther's justification, the blade to Wesley's sanctification, the tossel to Pentecostal's gifts of the spirit, the shock. You see, um, the life pressed forward through the stalk, but only now in the closing of the age does a return to what it was at the beginning, a mature, wordfilled, spiritquickened bride, &gt;&gt; just as she was in the upper room. Now I want to say this. This is not the first bride age. The first bride age was Pentecost. 2,000 years ago &gt;&gt; when the church was born in power was a pure golden seed of wheat. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was it was it was the culmination of all the scriptures of the Old Testament encapsulated in a body called the bride. And she was rapture ready. I want you to get this. She should have been in the rapture. She was as rapture ready then just as she is to be now. But as Eve fell before the wedding, the early church fell to the nickelan doctrine and denominationalism. And she went from a chase virgin to look at her in the Bible in Revelation 17 called a She polluted her womb with men's ideas. &gt;&gt; But now in the evening time, there's light again and the bride is restored to her original condition. Not something new, but a restoration. Not another age, but a ripened fulfillment of the seventh. And she is now ready. The grain is ga being gathered. The trumpet is about to sound. and the garner is awaiting us. This is where we're at in time now. So, let's talk about this for a moment. The birth of the church at Pentecost. As Adam was given a bride fresh from the hand of God and was undefiled for a free brief time, so was Christ, the last Adam, given a pure bride, pure and fresh at Pentecost. And she remained separate and undefiled for some time. and the and of the rest does no man join himself to them. And the Lord added daily such as should be saved. Right? How long this continued, we don't know. But one day, even as Eve was tempted and seduced by Satan, so the church was contaminated by the entrance of the Antichrist spirit. And as John said, 1 John 4:3, "And that this is that spirit of the antichrist whereof you all have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world." So here he's already recognizing the antichrist is moving. And Jesus said concerning his bride in that first age, he said, "I have somewhat against thee because you left your first love. And remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, repent." I want you to get something. In the first church age, they had already began a fall. It went from a rapture ready state to a fallen church. Think of that. Now, you see, she was a bride once before. She was a pure bride. She was born in power. Oh, yeah. She was clothed in glory. She's filled with with not a portion of the spirit, God's fullness. The Bible, the Bible said in the book of John, of his fullness we have received. &gt;&gt; Grace for grace. &gt;&gt; Come on. That's why when grace grace comes again, it's fullness time again. So you see as Eve came fresh from the side of Adam and so a bride came fresh from the sight of Christ and she was washed in the blood and she was baptized in the spirit and and and look the church was in that first age already a fallen woman as Satan had got to Eve before Adam. Even so, Satan seduced the church and the bride of Christ before the marriage supper of the lamb. And what specifically was in her midst that caused the fall? What? But Revelation 2:6, the deeds of the nickelans, something went out to conquer the leoty, the church already that first age had turned from following the pure word of God. They turn from God's demand of a church uh absolutely dependent upon him dependent entirely upon God to fulfill his word from start to finish apart from human government to nickelanism which is organizing a human government within the church which is all governments do legislate for the people and that's what every organization does is legislate for its people. And God never intended for a denomination to rule over us. &gt;&gt; Come on. Which one did God ordain? Which one does the scripture ordain? Never. They're moves of men. &gt;&gt; They're when men rise up and they have this little fear within them. Oh, we're going to lose what we have, but we got to we got to we got to keep these truths. So, they organize around them and they put a period to what God's doing. And what happens when they organize? They die. The life leaves. Oh, they may still have a form, but let me tell you something. This is what Paul realized when he wrote and he says, "I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy. I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chase virgin to Christ." This is what he wanted in his age to present to Christ a chasteed virgin. But I fear, lest by any means a serpent begile Eve through his subtlety, so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that's in Christ. For if he cometh, he that cometh preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or if you receive another spirit which you have not received, or another gospel you which you have not accepted, you might bear with him. I'm I'm afraid you'll receive another Jesus. &gt;&gt; Now, he may be called Jesus, but let me just tell you, the Jesus of Rome is not the Jesus of the Bible. &gt;&gt; Come on. The Jesus of many churches today, the Bible said he would sit in the church, the man of sin, claiming to be God. So he would actually hide himself in the church and and there be enthroned in the church and be worshiped in God as God and he ain't even God. It's the devil when you take the mask off of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I'll just take Rome for a minute. I mean, come on. Their Jesus that they have manufactured, they have made in their image, in the image of the church is a Jesus that has to obey his mama. &gt;&gt; Is a Jesus that you have to say so many Hail Marys. &gt;&gt; Is a Jesus that cannot save you, but one day when you get over there after somebody's prayed you out of purgatory, you can might be saved. You see, it's a Jesus they have made. Now, friends, that's just the mother. What about her harlot daughters? &gt;&gt; Come on. Look, look what look what look what this last move did. You know, get people down the altar, shake their chin up and down, pat them on the back, and say, you know, until they get a confusion of language. That's not what happened at Pentecost. &gt;&gt; It wasn't manufactured tongues. It was the Holy Ghost giving utterance. &gt;&gt; It wasn't a confusion of words of Jesus to you until you're stammering and just saying things that are incoherent. That's not speaking in tongues. That's manufactured &gt;&gt; impersonations. But that gets in the church creeds and they put out the real Holy Ghost. And let me tell you, this Holy Ghost will make you live right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Paul is talking about this and he said, "I'm jealous." He recognized this threat of corruption, the same satanic subtlety that deceived Eve in the garden. He feared the church would also fall from the simplicity of Christ into a into doctrinal deception. So he said, "I fear less by any means as a serpent begal Eve." So you know how would it happen? By receiving another Jesus, another spirit and another gospel. Counterfeits watch that look and sound like the truth but are perversions of the original. So the fall came just as he discerned as Paul feared it happened. The early church who was once spiritfilled pure began to compromise lose their first love. The antichrist spirits crept in through during that first age and by the time of the third and fourth century the nian um na formalized the fall and and the church left her espouseed husband and committed spiritual fornication adultery with the kings and the systems of the world. And by the time we reach Revelation 17, this fallen church is no longer described as a virgin, but the great &gt;&gt; full of blasphemy, &gt;&gt; clothed in scarlet, drunk with the blood of saints. &gt;&gt; Come on. And that's why this message to this final age is so urgent. Because the same serpent that beguiled Eve in the beginning there in Eden and later crept out into the church with subtle corruption is still working today. He's doing everything he can to pull us away from the original faith. His tactic hadn't changed. You know, only faces has. He still slithers in with with whispers. Yayath God said. Of course, you know, he wasn't a he wasn't a snake in a tree. He was a he was like a man. He stood upright. He had he was able to talk. He was able to reason. &gt;&gt; Right. But you see, he comes in. Yeah. As God said, and he questions the word and then twist it. adding a little here, removing a little until what is left is no longer truth, but a perversion of the truth. &gt;&gt; Now, here's the tragedy. Deception works. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Yeah, it works. The modern church, like Eve, listens too long to the wrong voice. She ends up rejecting the voice of God, the real Jesus of the word. And she receives an impostor, a man-made Christ that has been shaped by creeds and and dogmas and traditions of man and stripped of deity, divorced from his word, and powerless to save or deliver. So what road? Going out in the first stage, a white horse, an impostor, a deceiver, looked like Christ, but it wasn't him. And I saw, and behold, a white horse, and he that sat on him had a bow, and a crown was given to him, and he went forth to conquer and to conquer. Notice this. This is prophetic symbols in the Bible where this writer goes forth and and at first glance it is on white, you know, it's dressed in white. It has a bow. It he's a mighty conqueror going out. Oh, that's got to be Christ. It suggests purity because he's wearing white, but it isn't. It's deception. How many is with me? &gt;&gt; This is not the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; This is a a usurper. It's a false Christ. Is a religious impostor. Is the Antichrist that rides out in the very first age. Listen, he didn't start just finally show up in our age. &gt;&gt; He's been working in every age. &gt;&gt; He just changes tactics. It's the same writer, but he'll be on the on the next one. It turns bloody red as he gets the power of the state and a sword to kill. And now he begins to wipe out everything that don't agree with him. He gets the power of governments behind him. And they begin a huge persecution where 68 million are slaughtered down through the ages. And then wipes out the true remnant that to where they're just such a small number until he can ride out now with a with a black horse and very sell the very source of life. A measure of wheat for a penny, a measure of barley for a penny. selling the very things that Jesus paid and gave freely his life for and prayed for it. &gt;&gt; And now you have to buy your salvation and buy a candle to pray your your your lost ones out of purgatory in paying for what Christ died for and paid freely. And he winds up as an amalgamation of all three of these as a pale horse. And his name now is revealed by the last living creature of the lion, the ox, the man, and the eagle. The eagle screams out. His name is death. &gt;&gt; But before he's not identified and people think it's Christ. until the last age and his mask gets pulled off of him. &gt;&gt; The man of sin is revealed, the son of predition. &gt;&gt; And we trail that serpent all the way from Eden all the way down to the end. And we see him in the last day. Why? Because he's going to have a bride that will not be deceived. her eyes will be will receive the eyesight and be open to the truth in the last day. This is God's word. Now, I want you to notice he has a bow. The Bible says no, this says nothing about arrows. He's symbolizing dominion. No arrows meaning he had no real power. &gt;&gt; Just the appearance of it. &gt;&gt; You know, that's what churches have come down to today. No real power, just the appearance of it. &gt;&gt; And he was then given a crown, not earned by victory on the cross like Christ. Come on, but by given by men, a political religious authority given by councils, not by Calvary. And he went forth conquering, but not by truth, but by deception, not by spirit, but by dogma, &gt;&gt; taking parcels truths, organizing on it, and then making bodies of believers. And this was that Antichrist spirit appearing religious, writing within the church, blending in with the wheat. But at the heart he was a deceiver. He had religious profession. Oh yeah. Very religious. Lots of forms there. Beautiful lithogy rituals. My goodness. You know uh a claim to divine authority but no indwelling spirit. He could quote the quotes. &gt;&gt; Oh he can today. &gt;&gt; But he couldn't produce life. He wore a crown but not the scars of Calvary. He held a bow but no arrows of deliverance of truth. &gt;&gt; It was all a show. &gt;&gt; Come on somebody. A religious system that mimicked Christ but denied his power. Amen. &gt;&gt; As Paul said, having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away. And the same spirit rides on through the ages culminating in the final leodysian age where Christ is pushed outside a system of religious rules in his name. But without his person, his presence or his power church, it ain't going to be as one bit of good to symbol. And Jesus ain't here. A church without the spirit is a church that is powerless. And she is a church that is rejected her husband and is an adulterer. And the final call to the bride is receive ass. And that's not optional. It's vital. You got to have it. It's not just revival. this restoration back to the original word, the original life, to the original Jesus Christ is the only way to escape the great deception of this age and be joined to Christ, the the true Christ, not the impostor. The spirit and the bride say, "Come." And the bride is crying out in this hour in unison with the spirits. same urgency that the prophets and apostles had that said, "Come out of her, my people." &gt;&gt; And I'm looking at men and women that are sitting here today. You heard that call &gt;&gt; and that's why you are here. &gt;&gt; You came out of false religion and you came out of lukewarm system and you came out to be joined to the word of God made flesh in this hour. Christ in you, the hope of glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sister Gy, that's why you left the Hutter rightites. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why you lift left it all behind your loved ones, your K folks, and everybody else and walked out. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you didn't. You heard the call that said, "Come out of her &gt;&gt; and you responded to that vine divine call." &gt;&gt; And Christ is now still calling out a bride, a true word bride. And she won't fall like Eve. She will not compromise like the early church, but she will stand unblenmished, filled with the spirit, clothed in the pure word. He said to that first age, I have somewhat against. And that age would fall before the marriage could take place. And the original bride who was meant for the rapture was diverted and not raptured to the garner but was planted. Look at your neighbor for a moment. Say they were she was planted because God would not leave his church in that condition. And his work of redemption began to even restore the church to original glory as he himself instead of coming back sat down to intercede on her behalf. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, you say, "But brother Tim, he was there and he was he sat on there for for ignorance sake." And now ignorance is over. Not for everybody. &gt;&gt; There's still members of the bride of Christ whose names are on the book &gt;&gt; that the light hasn't dawned on yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me? Amen. So, they ain't all come to the knowledge of the faith and to the unity of the spirit. And until that happen, he's still knocking. Until that happen, he's still seeking. &gt;&gt; Until that happens, there are people that are still respond to him. He's still saving. He's still delivering. He's still setting free. He's a God rich in mercy. &gt;&gt; More grace than ever. It's double grace. &gt;&gt; The caps don't come and crying. Grace, grace, &gt;&gt; grace that will pardon and cleanse within. &gt;&gt; God's word never fails. The wheat that was planted at Pentecost went down in the ground during Na, but it's come back again. Word for word, life for life, the corner weed has returned to its original. And we're not going out as a weak church, &gt;&gt; but a victorious church. &gt;&gt; To him that overcometh, like I always say, and I say it again this morning, he could not say to him that overcometh unless somebody's going to overcome. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The very word of God prophesied over you and spoke of your coming that you will overcome. &gt;&gt; So whatever sin, whatever problem, whatever unbelief, no matter what it is, you will rise above it. &gt;&gt; You are not of the fallen world, you're not of the fallen church. You are of a rising church, &gt;&gt; a triumphant church. said, "Well, Brother Tim, I got a few wrinkles this morning." But he didn't worry about the wrinkles. He said, "When I get through with you, &gt;&gt; you'll be without a wrinkle." &gt;&gt; Well, I got a few blemishes this morning. Well, confess the thing and put it under the blood. It'll be white as snow. &gt;&gt; Amen. Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow. You don't have to live with that. You don't have to live in that unbelief. Come on. applied the blood to it. Repent of it. Move on. Let it wash you white. &gt;&gt; He said your garment would be without a spot. &gt;&gt; You look at yourself and you say, "I'm not what I ought to be." I'll tell you what, let the word of God wash you this morning. Let it cleanse you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my goodness. We're not a defeated church. We're queen to the king. We're standing with him in this final hour. Just as he overcame and sat down. Remember, he went through it himself and overcame, we will overcome and take our seat with him. Glory. For he has said he hath made us kings and priests. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we suffer with him, we will also reign with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the same life that was in the seed of Pentecost is right now back to the grain gathered into the garment restored to original form passed through the blade, the tsle, the shut. And now the word bride stands full and mature and prepared to meet her bridegroom. Leodysia is the age of maturity, the adoption age where a bride is exalted to the throne. they become co-regent with him to reign with Christ to the millennium. Now, I'm just going to take the next few minutes and we'll bring this down to a close, but I I got to get to at least a portion of this today. And and this is the words of Jesus. Now Jesus told us that the kingdom of heaven or the realm of the Holy Ghost would be like this. He said as the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade then the ear after that the full corn in the ear. So Jesus likens us to a grain of wheat that is planted. And he says the church will come forth in in stages &gt;&gt; that she after her planting that into the earth that it would bring fruit. The earth would bring fruit of itself and it would bring first the first the blade, the ca the the the ear and then the full corn in the ear. Now, so as we start right here, I want you to look at what was original. As you see up top, you see the golden grain ripe and ready for the garner. That was the early church, the seed at Pentecost, the original word bride. In Acts two, she is born in power and unity and pure doctrine. She's filled with the spirit and walking in the full revelation of Jesus Christ. Oh yeah. Oh, I I know there I know people want to argue with me and say, "Oh, we got things today they didn't have then." No, we're just understanding things of symbols that was written in mysteries that was pertinent to our age. &gt;&gt; But what has been restored is the original message Paul had. &gt;&gt; So therefore we are walking they were walking in the full revelation of Jesus Christ. And the same life that was in the early church was now in that early or that was in Christ rather was now in that early bride. So the life of Christ, the full measure, the Holy Ghost was poured into the church. All that God was, he poured into Christ. And all that Christ was, he poured into the church. &gt;&gt; And that church was the original grain. And she was ready. But now I want you to look at the the bottom picture there. You see decay and a move away from the original had started. Now anybody knows if you're going to take a grain into the garner, you cannot take it when it sprouted. &gt;&gt; It's too late. It has already started to decay. &gt;&gt; And this is what happened. You know, it was ready for the garner. It was ready for the rapture. It was the bride age. It was marriage time. But she got deceived like Eve. Now then she gets polluted little by little and the seed breaks down until finally you will find in the plant there is absolutely no remnant of this original seed. Nothing left of it. It's totally decayed. But the life of it has went into a little Now it's working right here underground. You can't see it yet, but it's there in the darkness. A little chute putting down some roots and and and and as some will argue with me about this early church said, "Well, they didn't know the seals." It wasn't sealed to them. &gt;&gt; The book was open. It slowly became closed because of the Antichrist spirit that rode out to conquer and the seed deteriorated in the soil and the life moved from grain to a blade. And that blade had the life of the grain in it but was no longer like the original grain of wheat at Pentecost. Now it was still the seed but it could no longer be taken into the garner. It was underneath the soil and the church entered the dark ages. But even as the spirit of life was still moving, it would emerge now in a different form that would even be like the original. &gt;&gt; Nothing like the original seed, but bearing his his life in a different form. Now I want to show you now as we come now to this to this to the the blade. it emerges out of the dark ages and it comes up you know with these little fingers of blades and we will just really talk about one which is Luther and but I mean and there there's also other leaves like the Baptists the Anabaptist movement they come back to water baptism by immersion and not baptizing babies but you know but but adults and you know they got that revelation and Luther gets a a revelation of truth of salvation by grace through faith. And not only that, guess what? After all these years of coming out of the dark ages, they didn't even have a Bible. &gt;&gt; And Luther under that man age, you know, the ox, the man, the lion, the ox, the man, and eagle. Now we're in the man age. And here he with the intelligence of a man invincutenberg press. The first thing that they're printing is the Bible. &gt;&gt; And they print the Bible and they get it in the language of the common people because before now it's all written in Greek or Latin and is hidden away in the courses of Rome. But now it's brought out into the light. So here now the church emerges from the darkness into the light. And now Luther restores the truth of salvation by grace through faith. This is all he he kind of, you know, the book is sealed, but he kind of cracks it open enough to to look in there and say, "Ah, but the just shall live by faith." &gt;&gt; Now, you don't see the full revelation. &gt;&gt; He just gets a portion. And with the portion of truth comes a portion of the spirit. And as the Holy Ghost is poured out, they are justified by his faith. Now, let me tell you, these Lutheran people that really believe will be in the great resurrection, &gt;&gt; and they're part of the bride of the seven ages. &gt;&gt; But there comes a time in the harvest. This blade no longer has life and it's all dry and it's left behind when the grain is raptured. See? Now watch. So we come right here is with a return to the authority of the scripture and then we have the pollination age, the tassel. Now, if you look right there, you'll see little golden slivers there. And I I don't know what they're called. I I forgot to look it up, but it's it's pollen. And it it as a plant begins to mature, John Wesley is emphasizing, but yet Luther's revelation was good, but we're an advancement of the Lutheran age. And so he said, "We got to have some holiness and a sanctified life to go with it." &gt;&gt; I wish they believe that today, but they're dead on the vine, &gt;&gt; right? They lost all of their holiness. &gt;&gt; I mean, they're embracing every kind of thing. And you know during this age revival and missionary uh spreads like pollen and and and there and a deeper personal commitment is restored. And so yet it was reformation yet there was restored truths. And then I I want to take you one right on down to the next one. And of course, now we come to another age, which is the Isuza Street Revival, the Pentecostal movement with restoration of the gifts. And the plant now looks close to the grain, but it's still not the original seed. Now, this is different, but it's like, you know, when you go out and you uh you pick regular corn and you pull back the shock and you look in there and you can see um little tiny, you know, if you get it really early, you you'll see where it's beginning to form, but it's not there. Amen. It's not ripe. &gt;&gt; Now, if you make a mistake as a farmer and go out there and and and harvest your crop, you ain't got nothing to eat but chucks. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this exactly what this is that spiritual gifts return to the church speaking in tongues healing prophecy and the outward appearance resembles Pentecost but it's not yet the full word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now this is I want you to get this. This is one and this is going to be important when I I'm going to teach you on the Holy Ghost. The evidence of the Holy Ghost. We're going to we're going to speak about adoption, all of these things in in some of the things that I have that I want to teach to the church. But this produces the most deceptive time that the church ever known. And it's not because of open rebellion and blatant atheism, but because of imitation and impersonation. Look at it. It looks like it's grain, &gt;&gt; but if you take it in the harvest now, you'll have nothing. So the Enusa movement bore the outward resemblance to the original Pentecostal outpouring. And they even called it Pentecost, but it wasn't. It was just another stage of the life on the way back to Pentecost. Now watch. The Isuza street bore outward resemblance to the original outpouring, but it lacked the full manifestation of the word made flesh. It looks like grain. It talks like grain. It shouts like the grain, but it's not the grain. &gt;&gt; It's the shock. And it's a twin. Get this now. It's a twin to the real Pentecostal church even though it bears the same name. And that's what makes it so deceptive. It's not Antichrist outside the church. It's Antichrist in the guise of the church. A shuck wrapping itself around the life of the grain. It has all the externals of Pentecost, gifts, music, emotional expression, tongues, gifts of the spirit, healing, miracles, but it lacks the quickened seed of the word that brings that that brings a life into full maturity and and its churches are full of grandchildren and great grandchildren of those who once had life but failed to move with the light. Did you hear me? &gt;&gt; And that, you know, that's what we're looking at when we when we examine them, even the membership of these churches today. They're filled with grandchildren or great great grandchildren or great great grandchildren of what was once a move of God, but they're lacking the same life that they had and the same power they had. That's why that we must not produce grandchildren cuz God has no grandchildren. He only has sons and daughters. That's why everybody must have a new birth, a personal experience with God. It can't be handed down secondarily from somebody else in another generation. and you're wearing grandma's religion &gt;&gt; and you're trying to walk around with daddy's religion on you. You've got to be clothed with the Holy Ghost yourself. &gt;&gt; Now, as the grain ripens, the truck pulls away. Now, this is Bible church. We're not going on hearsay. This is Bible we're basing this on. When he comes, he will thoroughly purge his floor. He will separate the wheat from the chaff. He will gather the g grain into the garma. The shock will burn in the tribulation with unquenchable fire. The wrath of God will be poured out. The seven vials will be poured out of stored up judgments in the tribulation to come. So this is the hour when the word bride is forming and Christ and his bride the hope of glory. And as the full grain appears, the husk begins to dry. Now, that which once looked alive is now dead. Now, wait a minute. The grain isn't dead. That's where the life is. It's mature. It's ready for the garner. It's ready for the harvest. But look at the blade. Life is lifted. It's no longer there. Where is the life? Do you see any life there? Yeah, there's some life. It's in the grain. That's where the life is. &gt;&gt; It all left the other stages of the plant and comes into a form that can be raptured. &gt;&gt; Now watch. Here's the deception. People are still worshiping in the shock. mistaken the outer revival with his emotion and church structure is for inner life. But the real bride, friends, she's not just dancing or shouting in the spirit. She's feeding on the hidden mana. &gt;&gt; Amen. She's ripening under the sunlight of this evening time and she's becoming one with the word. See, the the true grain must be identical to the original seed that was sown at Pentecost. Not just in gifts, but in life, in doctrine, in purity, in power, &gt;&gt; it must be the word made flesh again. &gt;&gt; Where? In a people, &gt;&gt; Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. The manifestation of the son of man, Christ in bride form. &gt;&gt; And when that grain is fully formed, there's no more use for the shock. It separates. The shuck cannot follow the grain into the harvest. It has served its purpose. It had a purpose, but it served its purpose. Everything of the stalk, the shuck, the blade, the pollen is left behind. None of it goes in the garner. Only the original bride word goes back in a rapture. And this age is not going to be planted. We're not going to go through seven more ages. &gt;&gt; Read your Bible. There's not 14. &gt;&gt; There's only seven and we're at the last one. &gt;&gt; So, we're not going to perpetuate the ages. This is the bride age where a bride receives her bridegroom is changed in a moment of twinkling eye and goes to the rapture. That is the age we're in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So therefore, you see, yeah, that Pentecostal shock was that movement. It was a significant part of God's redemptive cycle. My goodness, great men of God. Smith Wigglesworth, Frank Bartleman, you know, uh, all all of all the different ones, you know, that that that you could think of. You could call her names, you know, uh, FF Bosworth and great men of God. John G. Lake, men, men of God. That's where the life was. &gt;&gt; And I want you to say, if you wanted to be saved in that hour, that's where you had to find salvation. &gt;&gt; That's where the life was. Amen. Now, but now the life had moved out of the Methodist age. And when it moved into the shuck, it was now manifested in a fresh outpouring of the spirit. But according to the cycle of wheat, after the shuck comes the grain. &gt;&gt; What did he say? The not the immort, the full corn. of the ear. And when the seventh angel sounds his message, remember Goliath delivered the final message to the final age. The life left the shock. &gt;&gt; And from that point on, it was no longer the Pentecostal age or the Zuza Street age. It now was the bride age where a bride was called out &gt;&gt; not out of leodyian age or the seventh age or under out from under the seventh angel but it was called out of the lukewarmness. It was called out of religious systems. It was called out of the ship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But it only way out of the seventh age is a rapture. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's why we're not merely in the Pentecostal age or the era of the Zuza Street movement anymore. We are, although we're still in the seventh age, we are now in the bride age, bride time, bride era, a prophetic time of union, maturity, where the life has now moved into the grain. This is the time of the marriage of the lamb. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Revelation 19:7 says that now listen you don't look you don't take you don't take that and harvest it. You will just have bailed hay straw. You don't take that and harvest it. It's not harvestable. You just have bail's bail. Hey, animal fodder. You know, you know, you don't even take that. &gt;&gt; It will not keep. You know, in that in that stage, it's it's still in the milk stage. It will not keep. It won't last for eternity. Most time it won't last from one revival to the other. They're right back at the altar trying to get the Holy Ghost again. &gt;&gt; Come on. It's only in this stage that you can take in the garner &gt;&gt; where it is laid in the presence of the sun, the word of God, and is ripened and come fully matured like the bride was at Pentecost. Then it can be taken in the gardener. Now, let me bring it to another illustration. Now he types it as a marriage, right? The marriage of the lamb has come. You don't take a child to be married. Luther's age was like a little girl at let's say eight or 10 years old. Wesley brought her into adolescence at Isuza Street. She reached the a the stage of a young woman, but she still wasn't ready for marriage. And now under the reveal in the word, she comes to full maturity. Just like the church began 2,000 years ago at Pentecost with the people filled with the spirit, fully married to the word. So the bride finishes as a mature woman clothed in the righteousness of Christ, full of oil, ripened by the sun of the evening light. And she is now the grain, the part that is gathered into the garner. As James said, be patient, therefore, brethren, to the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth. And he has waited now for seven ages. And he is about to throw in the sickle. And this is where we are where the same life that was in the seed has now returned. Not just gifts, but the full mature revealed word. Although it has ever divine promise in it, healing gifts, miracles, signs, wonders, it can't be the full word without having it. Come on, somebody help me preach. Amen. The bride is pure, mature, and ready for the harvest. Amen. She is a bride that has made herself ready. And guess where the grain appears? She appears in the last age where the book is revealed. And that's where we are in this very time in the fullness of the word. ready to be gathered into the garner. I'm going up. &gt;&gt; I'm part of those that are rising. &gt;&gt; I'm not a part of the fallen church and I'm one of those that are communing with him. I've opened the door for him to break the bread, &gt;&gt; reveal himself, make his word known, and me eat it and become one with it. Can't you see why I'm happy? &gt;&gt; I've accepted the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let the musicians come. Oh, I' I'd have loved to been able to go on. I'd love to taken you and maybe maybe I will, but I'd love to take you on and into into you know what happens next. You know what where where we go from here? We go into the garner. were there at the marriage supper and from there we come back with him in Revelation 19 and and and we could discover all the wonderful truths of the battle of Armageddon of of of the the the final rebellion of Gog and Magog and and then we could we could come and see what happened to Jews and what happens to the false prophet and the beast and all of these things and where Satan is bound for a thousand years. It's there's so many things laying here in the word, so many truths that God wants you to see. &gt;&gt; One thing he wants you to see that you're not a part of the tribulation ahead. &gt;&gt; You see why this had to be revealed. Otherwise, you'd be trying to be the the that multitude without number that washed the robes in the blood of the lamb and made them white in the tribulation. You be trying to be that. But God is showing you, you are not that people. That's the church going through the tribulation, but the bride is raptured out before that. He's showing you, you're not the 144,000. That is not your message. Don't try to take that part. &gt;&gt; Amen. He He expire He unveils and shows the whole inner system where where he can say, "Here is that Antichrist system and you are outside of it. You're not a part of it. &gt;&gt; You are redeemed. You are washed by the blood. You are the bloodwashed church. You're ready for rapture. Amen. You are the grain return. You are the people of the bride age. You are the people of the book. You are the overcomer in the age. You are the weak. You have token life. You have God on life in you. You are sons and daughters of the great king of glory. You are the overcomer in this age. Let's stand together and let's rejoice. Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Why don't you just raise your hands and worship God right now as you love him with all your heart? [Music] I'm so happy I've accepted the word of the Lord. The revealed word that was spoken by the prophet Malachi. Oh, can't you see? Oh, why I'm so happy. Oh, the word of the Lord. [Music] The revealed word that was spoken by the prophet of man. Oh, can't you see? Can't you see [Music] why I'm so happy? I've accepted the word of the Lord.

We're going to be having um communion and foot washing and um and then of course after that we will gather here in the fellowship hall for a fellowship meal that we will enjoy together. So no one has to leave. you know, you are welcome to stay even if you're not taking the communion. You can just remain at your seat and uh let me give you a little instruction of what we're going to do. The ushers will come and they will call you by row and they will bring you up two sides. You'll meet here at the table. You'll take the communion. You go out these doors. the men go to the right, the women go to the left, go to foot washing. If you're up in age, elderly, or got a situation that you you you don't take the the foot washing, well, then you just go right back to your seat. You wait and we'll be coming back for the dismissal and dismiss the audience then all together as we just worship the Lord. Now, we want to make this really a time of worship just for a moment. Before I read the scripture, I want to sing the song, He Was Wounded for Our Transgressions. And after that, I'm going to dismiss the musicians. We'll turn on a some music so that they can come to the line first so they can be back here for the conclusion of the service very very soon. So our personnel will be going through the line first and then out to foot washing and then back. So right now I want you just to consecrate yourself. We don't have a closed communion here. Communion is open to any believer. You don't have to belong to our church. If you profess Christ as your savior, you're living a a life that is sanctified and you receive that portion of his spirit, then you're welcome to the communion table. And today we are doing this to observe the last things that Jesus did and he commanded us to do them. [Music] And he took bread that was unleaven representing his own body free from sin and he broke it and he said take eat. This is my body which is broken for you. And then he would take of the blood of the grape. That was the life squeezed out. And he says, "This is my life that was squeezed out for you." [Music] When you take this, do this in remembrance. I want you to remember what I did for you. I want you to remember Calvary. Now as we will take this bread, it came from one loaf but we have taken it and we have torn it into hundreds of people pieces representing people because now his body on earth is his church. She's the corporate body of Christ. [Music] And when we take of this communion, we are confessing that we're part of Christ and part of his church. And we're confessing that we have drank of his blood, his spirit, the life that was in him. and we have received his spirit and we are making that profession before this congregation. Now, if we do that unworthily with sin in our lives, we're we are telling a lie before the church of God. And the Bible said because of this, many are weak and sickly among us. And many are asleep because they have not discerned this is the Lord's body. [Music] So today when we're coming here, we want to come consecrated ever sin under the blood, our lives cleaned up before him. We should have done it before we come to the church. But if we've done something to someone else, mistreated them or offended them, we should have made that right. This is a time of healing. It's not only a time of healing for the the spiritual healing, but it's a time of healing for the body. That as you come through this communion line and you take of this, it is symbolic just like when we anoint you with oil, it is symbolic of the Holy Spirit that we're placing between you and that sickness. this you are confessing. I'm a part of this body. I'm receiving of his spirit. I've received of his spirit. I have a right to the divine covenant. And therefore, in eating this, I am partaking of everything Christ has to offer. Healing, deliverance, salvation. And when you come through, I want you to believe for the healing of your body. It's afforded to you. Let's sing this together. He was wounded for our transgressions and he was bruised for our iniquities. He took all your punishment. Surely he bore our sorrow and with his stripes now his stripes we are healed. One more time. He was wounded for ruins transgressions. Make it personal. He was bruised for my iniquity. [Music] And surely he bore him sorrow. And by his strip is
