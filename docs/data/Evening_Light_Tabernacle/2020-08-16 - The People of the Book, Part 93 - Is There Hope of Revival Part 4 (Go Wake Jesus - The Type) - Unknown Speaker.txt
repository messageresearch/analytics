come by our way speak to us today and reveal yourself reveal yourself in your omnipotence because you reveal yourself where faith is where people believe amen amen some years ago you know i i prophesied as i preached when it came to himself you remember sister denise has strayed away from god and i had been several years and i was over in overseas in germany laying in bed just as i was preaching the convention there and the holy spirit woke me up i heard his voice saying denise is about to receive her last call and i looked up and i saw i don't know how you explain this when it's dark but i saw a dark shadow pass across a line and i thought god i'm the messenger what do i do now and got rich in his mercy turned her life around and saved her and brought her back to him he's that kind of god he's that kind of god that cares for us amen i told you dan we need to get ready for celebrations and i don't say that i didn't build this building for coverage so we could kind of separate ourselves although it's useful for that i built it so prodigals could come home [Music] hallelujah are you ready for celebration amen i got brother mike price here right here on the front seat with us standing by another former prodigal amen what happened god reaching mercy reached out and got him brought him back to him [Music] hey my god is that kind of a god he says welcome home children come on i've got a bloody calf i've been waiting i've been waiting for this moment hallelujah let's have a celebration bring out the room put on the ring put it give him authority over the demons of what's held in bounds [Applause] [Music] i don't know about you but i got my dancing shoes on this morning i'm ready for a celebration because this god is a god rich in mercy rich in grace he's rich in love [Music] his arms reaches out to reach right down to your place some of your prodigals have been writing me and you know he's got your number you're coming to i'm sending out a message you can't stay out there in the big slot very much longer you're coming home hallelujah we're here in the end time where prophecy is being fulfilled today i'm going to baptize brother mike here at the end of the service in the name of the lord jesus as he does his first voiceover gives a public witness that the old man is truly dead and he's rising up in the newness of life to serve the living god amen lord we thank you today we glorify your name because you're the only one could ever reach down and find us but you won't leave one of your children out there love us god so loved the world god so loved me and he gave his own life on my account that i could have life and life more abundantly and that old teeth that came to rob and to steal and destroy we are coming here today to claim back everything the devil stole from us souls of men and women who is he is taken out is it's an hour of restoration and we believe god and we believe his word and we thank you lord for your blessing to us today and as we look into the word will you just speak to hearts speak to lives amen just deal with them lord wherever they are right here in this building there are those that need satan right here in this building there are those that need healing maybe someone needs a spiritual healing a revival on the inside and they can have an old-fashioned pentecostal revival they can have it in themselves even though the world won't see a worldwide sweep and revival we can have it in ourselves we thank you for it father asking that you bless us now as we look into your word lord may you just help us in these things we pray in jesus name amen amen god bless you good to see each one of you today that are here visiting with us and those that are always so journey together with us the bride around the world that is um streaming here today god is here to meet your need and we know that because he's he's god amen he cares for his people matthew chapter 8 verse 23 we're going to read from um here and um i'm going to be speaking on today part 4 of is their hope of revival and we're going to be using go wake jesus the type because this is a type there's actually two of them we'll speak about it a moment but i've only used this part as a title um but there's another another one that brother branham would use to foreshadow the day that we're living in how many know that all the word that was spoken in the groom has to be fulfilled in the bride amen so matthew 28 i mean chapter 8 verse 23 and when he was entered into a ship his disciples followed him and behold there arose a great tempest in the sea in so much that the ship was covered with the waves but he was asleep and his disciples came to him and awoke him and said lord save us we perish and he said unto them why are ye fearful o ye of little faith and then he arose and rebuked the winds and the sea and there was a great calm but the men marveled saying what manner of man is this that even the winds and the way and the seas obey him and when he was come to the other side into the country of the gurgaons there met him to possess with devils coming out of the tombs exceeding fear so that no man might pass that way then matthew chapter 14 and verse 22 i'd like to read here this is actually the other one brother branham would use as a type of the end time type of the last days if he would preach on this many times after the seals he would preach on these subjects from these scriptures and straightway jesus constrained his disciples to get into his ship and to go before him to the other side and he sent them while he sent them multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up to a mountain apart to pray and when even was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary in the fourth night of the fourth watch of the night jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but to stray away jesus spake unto them be of good cheer it is i be not afraid and peter answered him and said lord if thou if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and he said come and when peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to jesus and when he saw the wind butchers he was afraid and began to sink and he cried saying lord save me and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him o thou of little faith wherefore didest thou doubt and when they were coming to the ship the wind ceased then they that were in the ship came and worshiped them saying of truth thou art the son of god amen god bless you as you are seated now brother branham often talked about two classes of people and they were the fundamentals and the pentecostals and he said in my travels i find two classes of people and i i just want to say that you know spirits don't die and and you know things just move right forward and so you just you can see them in maybe in one move or one time and they will resurface right on down into the end time prophecies and he said one of them in these classes is a fundamental positionally they know by the mechanics that they are to be sons and daughters of god then he said i find the nexus of pentecostals and they with the baptism of the holy ghost or the holy spirit now i want to say this this baptism there in that time era was rarely upon the soul but just on the flesh realm and you know just screaming and shouting and with worked up emotion and brother branham of course told him you know you you've got where you can whoop up the music as long as the music's going where you're shouting and whatever but he said how are you living after all the shout is gone and so you know we we know of course that everywhere that jesus is there is noise amen but there can be noise in jesus not present anywhere and brother branham would say we can get noise confused with the anointing he said noise isn't the anointing no no i've seen where there's a lot of noise and not enough faith to cure a toothache you've got to come solemnly to the father and so again you know he said i and i'm just giving a couple of these quotes but he said i've seen people shout and praise the lord not enough faith to heal a toothache now some some and especially in the seven thunder group under brother joe coleman there that they were trained to give a response and it was a trained response because they had to show this that they now had the token it was their evidence they were filled with the holy ghost because they said amen to the word and so they gave a trained response of running to the platform and standing and shouting and screaming to the preaching noise um that has sometimes been confused for the true anointing uh you know but much of it is no different from the priest of baal who elijah mocked as they tried to scream down the power of god and you cannot scream down his power you cannot work it up you can work up a motion but not the power of god and and and many times you know pictures are shown and even films and snippets are shown to this and you see and and it's touted as the bride's revival but it's just noise now the evidence of the holy ghost is not noise the evidence of the holy ghost is a surrendered life to god amen a life that that is worthy of the gospel that lives for christ that daily walk with god it's shown not in a an instance of a tongue or a shout or on a sunday but it's a life that must be manifested an everyday walk with christ obedience to the word of god no no denial of any promise of god now you know as a result we've it's sad but those under this umbrella of the message in this group their leaders have been in jail for ponzi scheme which built thousands of dollars from other believers and along with you know them are you know some of their high favored deacons like in europe or one of them molested his granddaughters while the elders blamed the underage girls rather than the man who did the naughty deed and this is what happens you know when you go out on a motion and you leave the word of god now brother branham said in all things he says oh you say i went down there and there was a lot of power brother the whole floor was dancing in the spirit and not enough faith to heal a toothache you call that power that's not power that's blessings there's a lot of difference between blessings and power god makes his blessings to upon the righteous and the unrighteous and and we got to get back to truth friends he said we've got to come back to what god means so a lot of difference between blessings and power so we have these two groups you know some are fundamental and it's word word word word word and and then of course the pentecostal side of the message were uh where they're you know where their own feelings and and sensationalism and you know numbers and you know emotion that goes with it you know of of water and they got a lot of faith but they don't know who they are and so brother branham said it's uh like money a man had money in the bank that and but couldn't write a check and one who had to write a check but had no money in the bank he said if you can just get them together so i think we got to see there's a third group out there amen there's got to be a third troop not just over here in fanaticism and not just word word word word where we become scholars and intellectuals but somewhere that have the word with faith and power amen now so again he said that that he said he was asked about the pentecostal so what makes him act like that he said well they were you know they just got some steam and they're having to get some bent somewhere you know but but if you they could direct it fundamentally in the word then the big regime of god would start moving on so he said there's where satan got in to make it all mechanics and no dynamics are back all dynamics and no mechanics and so we got to put it together we got to get the spirit of god but we got to come back to the with the word to feed this machine we can't feed it on creed that's man's ideas and self-interpretations to the message it won't burn it chokes up the flues it will not burn it it was made for the word of god and man shall not live by bread alone but by every word not just a part of it but every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god so you know again it's it's not as brother branham said this is the resurrection power is not about ceremonies and easter bunnies and fictions and jumps and shouts and imaginations and and and all of that but he said all of that will fail and pass away until the church becomes both the dynamics and the mechanics and the spirit of god that moved him to do the same the things that he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride amen for he said john 14 12 he that believeth on me the what shall i do shall he do also amen i'll give him a charge of my dynamics and his mechanics that the world will not be able to withstand it and i'll raise him up at the last day that's the easter message how many knows we have the easter message it is the rising of the sun amen shalom there's a new day about to dawn amen the first one from the dead out of all the dark denominationalism now there's a bride standing on her feet are you with me who is in the power of his resurrection showing forth resurrection signs he says that's the eastern message the dynamics and the mechanics together amen the mechanics without the dynamics no good i just want to say today across the nation and right here mechanics without the dynamics no good and he said neither is that dynamics without mechanics you can scream and shout and jump up and down all you want to and then deny this word it won't do any good you're just cranking around on the pistons got the spark there to fire but no gasoline to fire it by it'll only work as they come together so one will sit still and the other will go up well i don't know about you i don't want to be in the one the body that sits still i want to see it drive as it did in brother brennan's ministry and drive you down to healing and drive you down to salvation and drive you to a resurrection and drive us to a rapture amen but it'll take dynamics and mechanics we can't get out of balance in this age it only works as they come together yet both he said um they might look alike both claims to be churches both claim to be the bride but one has a mechanic and the dynamics it brings it to pass of what he said is the truth it just won't move no matter how good the mechanics is and we've tried it you know we got the greek and we we got seal one and seal two and seal ten and seal up 15 and still 115 and and on and on and on you know all of this teaching teaching teaching teaching it is about the time to preach the gospel to preach it means to demonstrate it [Applause] preaching this and just jumping out and down and hollering and screaming preaching is demonstrating the gospel it ain't how we deliver the message it's how it works god's got different ways of delivering it depending on how he made the man but he said well but again he says it just won't move no matter how good the mechanics is until the dynamics come when the dynamics come the fire is made to connect with that octane in the gasoline and when that explodes it causes a combustion and combustion moves every motion every move for he's the same yesterday today and forever that's the resurrection that's the real power of god mechanics with the dynamics notice it's the spirit that quickens it's the spark the fires it's not the gas that fires it's the spark that fires the gas amen as he says and once more there ought to be a holy power surrounding and in that church that will make demons flee instead of that it's become a laughingstock what is it mechanics instead of dynamics amen now you know he said why the church again when their eyes were open 64 why the church ought to be white ought to be in its most glorious stage now and the power of his resurrection great signs and wonders so if you're wondering what's prophesied for this hour there it is amen testimony on the sea he said we can begin to find out miracles isn't taking place anymore like they were and the sick goes home sick it isn't because of god it's because of the lack of revival among the people there's no revival to sit and listen and go home and say well guess that was pretty good uh-huh and there's not that zeal and there's not that something in the people that should be there amen now there are these truth thoughts that brother branham wove back back and forth and in her wove um after the seals and actually he touched on it some even in his own church but one thought was that of samson which we preached about last week and the others were the other thought was in be not afraid and testimony on the sea go awake jesus then jesus came and called different sermons like that and and so he these were these were types because remember they were foreshadowing another age to come what was done in the groom must also be done in the bride so we we can see some of these things there as as um that he dealt with where the disciples were between revivals there had been a great revival and they were testifying of the past some had jesus asleep in the boat and others had gone off without him so you had two groups of people some actually had jesus but he was asleep and the others didn't have him at all but had went off without him amen as i read this text and i'm hearing him tell him go there you know go and leave me here and go and i'd say i ain't never leaving you jesus if you ain't in this boat i ain't getting in it and that's the way we got to look in this hour you know if you're not in my life i don't want another moment if you're not really in my heart deep in my soul amen that seal under the day of redemption i don't want another moment without it i must have it amen amen and of course there was the thought of samson crying just once more lord brother branham preached the sermon on samson as the present state of the church i didn't aim at that he did said this is where we're at amen and he said and he preached that to his own church as a deceived church by the world and the and he warned his own church about being blinded and defeated and becoming scared of the new birth and he would say in the world is falling apart in 63 of november it seems like a drying out of the churches can hardly find a church anymore that's alive with the word with the spirit and the spirit of god and great things taking place like it was not long ago think of that he's looking at the church and he says i hardly can find one that's got both i mean i i'm not i'm not standing here with my chest out i'm not standing here as a bracket i am approaching this just like this god i want both of them i'm not satisfied with one or the other i want to see this word and the spirit work together the dynamics and the mechanics amen i i'm not standing here and gloating and saying we're the only ones that got it we're this and without i'm not i need to put off your bracket we have no right to brag if we got anything at all it's the grace of but god tell you what you ought to have an utmost desire in your heart god in my life i want it i want that revival in my soul i don't want to be left here in lethargic dead hopeless laodicea that's just lukewarm about it you know brother bratton would look at it and he could say i see one hope this is what he said to his own church deceived church by the worlds where he first preached us at you say oh this don't apply to brother branham's movement in the brother brandon's church oh yes it does he preached it first there and he says he says there is here's the only hope that i have this morning to wind up my message while simpson was bound a new shock of hair growed out who wants to be that new sock of hair amen not blinded and defeated but a people with renewed power who are restored church like what's promising the word to be and he says that the power of the holy ghost can come in her into demonstration of the spirits and mark 16 will can follow the church acts 2 4 acts 2 38 will all of it will be fallen right along with the church signs and wonders accompanied the apostles great signs of his resurrection accompanied them and while we're in prison surely god's growing a crop somewhere for the last great kill i mean he's ready for a final blow to the devil well it's going to take a complete dine out on our part amen and he said i trust message will will help bring the vitamin to your system that'll grow as spiritual power back in your life again now again you know as he would say in testimony on the sea another 64 sermon i'm saying this on purpose because of those who say well we can't accept nothing after 63 well here's 64. we've gone off without the old-time prayer meetings and the baptism of the holy ghost coming back until the fire has burnt low you just can't point back to the denominations there we got to look inward all of us around the world you cry out and try to get people to the altar and no we don't do that no more we don't have altar calls that's even worse it shows ichabod is wrote over me i'll read you the quote in a minute they just woke up and they were almost dead a dread to come and and and then ask ministers to come pray with them and oh why did he ask me for ministers and they get down you can't hardly get them and then they stand there for a few minutes and look up at you and go back to sit down to their seats to me the fire has gone out something has happened look what we need is a revival that sinners looking upon christ repent and run to the altar with their hands up and screaming for mercy and the whole church is a flame of fire with the glory of god again in jehovah jireh he was he he would talk about the altar calls i said i believe god's going to do some great things and that's the reason i have altar calls and do everything i can to find favor with him now watch remember this title god's provided way for this day 1964 sermon god's provided way for what this day hear it for this day amen he says they have never found a better way for a baby to give what it wants than to cry for it would you give him a bell and say junior you're only three days over them now when you want to do it when you want your bottle raise this bell up and ring it it just won't work the baby cries for what is won't that's what god's provided away the louder you cry he said don't whip the little fella he's the only he's only following god's provided way he wants something that's right it's the only way he knows is to call his mother scream for it cry for it that's right remember god's provided way for this day god recommends this for his children hallelujah god recommends this for his believing children [Music] he did not not in a he not intellectual speeches not some great theology to theology that treats he wants you to cry for your needs that's right cry for it you're too stiff and starchy you'll never get it if you if you see if you're ready to limber yourself up for a little a little and cry god will give it to you he likes to hear his children cry cry your needs to god god wants it that's his provided way cry out for it that's the way the baby cries that's the way he wants you to cry cry how long how long does a baby cry till he gets satisfied and that's the way the believing christians should do god's child if you see god made a promise don't give up on it cry till it's answered amen roger you see god vindicates this word and when god vindicates his word and proves it here then you don't have to cry no more amen you got it you walk away and thank him for it but until you do scream out till you get it i like that persistent holding on not a hybrid plant not one that has to be babied and petted and packed around christians are real genuine born again articles of god they fight for their position and that's what all this crying is about you're fighting for your position brother brother of jesus rather likened us liking himself that god is the unjust judge which is not unjust but he likened it and the and the approach to him and how to approach him hey man she and he said she cries day and night and he said because of her continual coming [Applause] i'm going to answer her and if you want something from god you got to be persistent you cannot ever give up on it you begin to cry you can knock and keep on knocking and you ask and you keep on asking and you seek and you keep on seeking [Applause] remember remember the very sign of those that are sealed which brother branham said you you can't preach this you hurt your church but he said one of the greatest signs of people being sealed is they're signing crying for the abominations that are being done yes i wonder if today if we hadn't become a bit calloused with all that we hear i don't know who she is but we're right here you know where the vice president rising up could be rising up in america she's not black she's an indian on her mother's side on her daddy's side she's haitian which is white and black and she identifies as an afro-american and she's not are you with me i remember but she's an evil woman she's a cruel woman and here she's coming up i don't know what our next election will be but don't think things are going to get better it's all playing in the hands of god we're right here on the fulfillment of prophecy and you you've got to fight for your position and when i begin the year out with joshua you know what joshua said it was told you know put your feet on the promise i won't fail you i won't leave you i'll be right there like i was with moses like i was with the messenger i'll be with you you're going to take this land you're going to go into the rapture but you got to be persistent that was another sermon that he kept preaching perseverance don't give up lay hold on it that's why jacob you know was known as jacob he he come out as the heel grabber he had a hold of his brother's heel my mind from the first floor as he came out his hand was wrapped around that's the way you've got to be a heel grabber amen i'm going to get a hold that promise i don't care how amen i'm going to get it come on and that was jacob no matter what he had to do no matter what what kind of things he had to go through he was going to get it so you have to come with determination come until you know you just stay there till you know it's over amen if you knock and you come once well i've been to the altar before well come again amen and don't just wait for church find an altar wherever you're at amen if you're in the woods if you're at work if you're in school wherever you are you seek that altar until your life is changed can be in the jail wherever it is you find an altar you cry till you get it i was so overjoyed the other day when some come down to the altars and i didn't even ask and sisters came and prayed with the sister and brother came and prayed with the brothers it overjoyed me to see those who joined with those seekers and brother branham said in jehovah jireh he says he said i want to say this about you people here that proves what you're made of i went to places even and people who's supposed to be spirit-filled people and see altar calls made and while you couldn't get people to go in and pray with anybody to pray with me it shows it's ichabod the spirit of the lord has departed but when you see that zeal and fire and longing and long for human souls so i want you to say something if it's ichabod for people you know let a soul come to the altar and nobody want to pray with him and that shows the zychabot then wouldn't it also be ichabod when we got preachers who won't make an altar call amen isn't it it kebab when an atmosphere isn't made in the church where sinners get out of their sheep and weep their way to calgary isn't that ichabod the glory has departed that's what ichabod means you remember it was in the it was in the in the in the days of samuel where eli had sent out the ark with for the battle against the philistines and the ark was taken that represents the word is taken down the camp of the enemy and there his daughter-in-law was giving birth about that time and she gave birth she died and as she died she named the child that was born ichabod the glory of the lord has departed because the ark of the lord is taken and when the word in his power leaves a church leaves a movement come on amen it shows the glory of the lord has departed when there's no more zeal no and there's no more desire to see a soul say when they're not people calling on god then you can see the glory of the lord has departed and he said we've gone off without the old-time prayer meeting the baptism of the holy ghost coming back to the fire that went low until there's this dread dread for even people to come up ministers won't even pray and he said there there again he says as an evangelist he talked about it in spiritual amnesia he said we actually get enough god about us till we come up the platform said yeah i better come up and you know now this is experience of worldwide he said this is not unique to this one place in birmingham but he said i better go up and stand well i don't know here i am um what a place to be in there's no fire burning there's no enthusiasm there's no go into it and as an evangelist that it kills me to see god's people in that shape but we're supposed to be on fire but you see what it is exactly what i told you revelation 3 you're lukewarm and he said because you're lukewarm i'm gonna spew out my mouth that's right what do you what that's what he said and if he said that's what he's gonna do let's not be in that crowd you're here needy let's get it or die right here that's right let's get it or die and that's got to be the the attitude of every one of us and every repentant sinner i must get it or die as vernon winters died here the other day with cancer and he said i know what i got this cancer he said the reason why is because i wouldn't surrender my heart to god and i'm so thankful for this cancer because in it god has given me an opportunity to come back and i would rather die with this cancer than to die an alcoholic i'd rather die with this cancer a christian than die an alcoholic a sinner god's to catch you amen you know there are truth thoughts that he presents he presents go away jesus or be not afraid to true condition one of them is a person or church who has jesus in the boat but just needs to rouse him with their faith and then the other is a person or church who has gone off without jesus and he's he's a he's afraid of the he's a very thing they need and they're afraid of it are you with me now again this is what brother branham said in 63 in august he said he says what people do about coming to christ they lay the foundation of believing on the lord and accept him as a personal savior and going on to christian baptism but when it comes on to fallen through to the baptism of the holy spirit somebody explains them away from that's the reason it's seed that fell by the wayside or fell on stony ground or shall i say fell among thorns now we re we read and we shared with you from the deceived church by the world and brother branham told his church you are afraid of the new birth and i'm just saying this is what has happened seemingly around around the the whole movement the message community they got to where they're afraid of the new birth amen they're afraid of the gifts of the spirit they want nothing to do with that wow they might be called pentecostal i hope i am called pentecostal because somebody's going to be a true pentecostal they're going to be the acts 2 pentecostal amen not this latter day azusa street but the one whose hearts have been turned back to the original faith of the fathers and brother branham sent himself in the laodicean church age i want to be that kind of pentecostal from the top of my head to the soles of my feet and there ought to be a people here today that said god make me like that original branch let me be a part of that not an impersonator but a part of that where there's a branch is a part the offshoot from the mind the original root and i'm bringing forth the life of christ as the apostles did and write another book of acts behind us and let me remind you the book of acts that we're writing is not all the quarrels and the fussing and the fighting and the failures the book of acts that is promised to us is the very things that jesus did you shall do also that the life that was in jesus is in his bride are you with me amen oh yeah they're afraid they might speak with tongues what paul said i would that you always speak with tongues but rather that you prophesy but then of course i prophet told us he said some people won't receive it unless they do speak with tongues and he said god's a good god he'll give you what you want but you can have tongues without the holy ghost why don't you just get the holy ghost and then he'll give you everything else you need amen amen and then become afraid of the anointing because we might be branded as the anointed ones at the end time well i hope i'm branded as that i didn't say i want to be branded as the anointed false ones but i want to be one of those that's anointed because the bride is the anointed one to this day hold on amen again in the shame brother brandon said this is in 65 before he parts he said instead of accepting the fatherhood of the word now he he says recognizing the word is our father and he said it would be a shame you know if your boy walks in and you say hey this is my son and you say my son huh no you're not my dad something that ugly can't be mine how would you feel as a father your daughter deny you right in the face of your company your friends strangers and he said when it comes to accepting the fatherhood of the word of god christ no they're embarrassed they don't want to say yes i have spoken tongues yes i have seen visions yes i believe in divine healing yes i praise the lord i was with brother ron here in a meeting back june of a few years ago and and and he talked about seeing the vision and whatever some woman come running up to him after that only brother branham could have visions and i thought we we supposed to be in the message 40 50 years and we're so immature that we don't know that sons and daughters of god shall see visions old men shall see dreams and young men see visions and i pour out my spirit upon all flesh amen and ashamed of him he said but let me say this a man who has once come in contact with god which is the word and the word has been made plain and manifested there's no shameless about it you're not embarrassed it don't embarrass me to say i believe every word of god it don't embarrass me to say when the lord says say any say anything you go and say and do it it don't embarrass me to say i've been filled with the holy ghost it don't embarrass me to say that i have spoke with other tongues it don't embarrass me to say that our lord has shown me vision it don't embarrass me to say he's the same yesterday today and forever we don't like this title that i'm fixing to share with you and we want to deny it and spit it out as a as a movement as a message community but listen your prophet in 63 november 30th the sickest body i know of is the so-called body of jesus christ it needs spiritual healing and there's only one bomb that i know that will heal and that's the word and that's the sick body that we want to stand up and strengthen the vitamin power of the gospel and that's why i use much of the time now trying to strengthen the church by the word and that's exactly where we're at today remember there's too many sick among us because they have not discerned the lord's body are you with me now as we as we speak of it as he says you know he says i'm not trying to support my ignorance he goes on to say by saying this but what we need now more that we need that we do the intellectual side to know how to put the word together and how to make it masterly fit is god we need god see it doesn't come always come through rightly formed words it comes through dedicated heart and that heart dedicated god and doing the will of god now you've got to know the will before you can do the will but find out what you're here for and that's the whole thing come to yourself realize what you're here for amen what is the church raised up for what would samson raise up to destroy god's enemy [Applause] and what have we been raised up for to defeat the enemy that the gates of hell cannot prevail against us to be a church who stands in this last day and not fall for anything and everything now i'll spend enough time on that i want to go into my thought here they're out on the sea they just had a great revival i'm just referencing what brother branham preached and he said it might have been the young john that hadn't had his heart so scarred with so much theology you know i think it's going to take some young john's in this day whose hearts ain't so scarred with so much theology you know well until we've explained the power of god away and we've expanded flame divine and healing we don't need it's a minor you know well hey you can't have the major without the miner what we you know we the gifts will be that that's pentecost so you know jumping down jumping up and down and trying to speak with tongues is over with now brother tim and i agree jumping up and down and trying to speak with tongues is over with trying to manufacture a gift and trying to work up a motion is over with i agree wholeheartedly well you know we got the divine now perfect interpretation of the word and when when that which is which is um which is perfect has come then that which in part is done away with and i want to say i so concur and i so agree that we're here at a time that when just having part is over with and you cannot have the perfect and a part left out so in the perfect has to be gifts of the spirit tongues interpretation divine healing the power of god come on amen it's got to be there to have that which is perfect because when that which is perfect it's come then then just having part is done away with you get a man sealed with the holy ghost down on the inside of the inside he might have lived with part as a justification he might have had another part with sanctification but when are you with me amen when he is filled in his soul and is redeemed come on and that seed is quickened on the inside of him then just having part of salvation is over with now the fullness has come and love his fullness we have received grace for grace you know your heart gets scarred with theology you're only concerned with theology i believe the message we believe the thunders we got the seals we do the book is open oh we believe in his coming the epiphany the perugia we believe this we believe that but when your heart isn't scarred then instead of thinking oh i'm so glad and i've got this comfort oh that i've got the certain theology and i got this certain knowledge of this revelation but you're thankful instead for his life and his power within you are you with me amen and he said john hadn't had his heart so scarred with so much theology he must have said something like this think of it right here in the ship this one that is identified by jehovah's word to be jehovah's service and servant in whom he is pleased is right here in this ship with us come on somebody amen there ought to be some of us not so scarred with theology until they're still rejoicing we can still shout and rejoice and say there's god in this ship it's not just theology there's really god in this ship i know he changed me he made me different amen oh there'll be a church so we can say we got god in this ship [Applause] not just theology but god's in this ship the great creator the almighty and you're thankful for his life and his power because as brother branham said and who is this not to know theology is life not to know the bible is life but to know him as life to know him as your personal savior as the one who has filled you with his presence you were there when it happened hallelujah how many can say this morning i was there when it happened amen and there's nobody can take it away from you there's no one can explain it away from you when that experience has happens to you you know who he is to me he's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever as brother branham said god called ministers ought not to be stuffed so stuffed out with theology but have visited the land to where we're going bringing back the evidence of the divine love and the power of jesus christ to make it known to their congregation that there is a land beyond the river so jesus is in our boat how many glad this morning jesus is in your boat amen my they they could look around and they could talk and say you know here he is the messiah here he is the anointed word here it is we saw the sign come down we heard the forerunner say this is my beloved son we heard the message that is john the baptist was sent before run the first coming you're sent with a message before run the second coming and that message is in the boat the very creator it created amen it resurrected fish come on somebody it created squirrels somebody helped me hey man it vanished tumors are you with me is say the young people come on somebody hey many calm storms i mean what was that the word was in our mix brother bradham said they had seen him out there healed the sick raise the dead for no things tell people the secrets of their hearts and believe they were on their road to another revival but then trouble set in and they forgot all about it they forgot when trouble came that jesus was really in their ship they began with every kind of self-effort they could they used their oars they pulled down the sails they did this they did that they they they hung onto the rudder till it breaks they do everything humanly possible and he said you know when trouble come in they forgot all about and he said that's the way we do he's still as great as he ever was hey man he's just still as great as he stood in space and said let there be and created the world he's just as great as he was when he was in the days of moses and open up the red sea he's as great as he was and so that the grave of lazarus when he said lives was come forth and if he hadn't said lazarus all the dead would have come forth he's as great as he was when he healed the leper when he raised up the when he opened up the eyes of the blind his power is not diminished his glory is not diminished amen his holy ghost still has omnipotence in it that can change your world in a second amen he's just as great as he was in the welsh revival he's as great as he was in azusa street he's as great as he was in the divine healing movement and he's still great right now this morning in 2020 where we are seeing marijuana's but there's troubled waters the winds and the waves are blowing there's fusses and churches splits over nothing hurts and divisions and wounds fusses in the church some like this way somewhat that way something's divided over the music somebody divided over this and something's abided over that you know what your problem is you lost the vision the vision is jesus is in our ship but yet you're looking out here at all and letting satan blow you over and rock your boat with all kinds of various opinions come on now and instead of staying straight on the word and saying i know he's the same yesterday today or forever and he can calm this storm he'll get us through because he's in our ship and there ain't enough devils in hell can destroy the ship that jesus is in hallelujah the gates of hell shall not prevail against her they ain't enough demons there ain't enough sickness there ain't enough trouble that can destroy and take down the ship that jesus is in and if you've got the holy ghost this morning there's not enough trouble not enough devils not enough sickness that can take you down and defeat you you're coming through the storm hope jesus is in your boat let him blow he knows he knows we're headed for him we're on our way we're on our way to find a legion a son of god a daughter of god who has been bound by devils and pulled down by hell but we're on our way because there's deliverance coming for god's children and god's people are going to be free every devil ever sinned every disease ever affliction hallelujah a prophet saw your coming and he said satan be careful there's somebody that is headed across the troubled sea and they're going to make it through to the other side because they got jesus in their ship and we're going to see delivered for all the seven ages and the dead and cracks arise and we shall be changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye it's god's promise and his promise never fails [Applause] she can only catch that vision god's still god he's not changed a bit he divided himself on the day of pentecost and part of that division is in me a portion of deity lays on the inside of me come on somebody amen the holy ghost with all this fire is right on in here and it's omnipotence and omnipotence can speak against sin against the seed against trouble hello hallelujah because we're not nebulous speaks all things happen because believers are believing each has a portion i got a portion of god you got a portion of god but in that portion is omnipotence i'm talking to a bunch of devil defeaters hey man bunch of mountain moosers movers satan bruisers amen some this morning's gonna rise up and crush the head of that serpent that's been bothering you for way too long you'll be able to break those cycles in your life of up and down and in and out it's something like that they need to wake jesus but sadly there's others that don't have jesus to wake some churches cannot say it some churches i only speak in from 50 years of experience not speaking as a novice here slinging out some words everywhere i'm just saying some of you don't have jesus to wake he ain't been in your church in so many years you wouldn't even know him if he came there's not been an amen or a hallelujah or glory to god come on amen you went off without and there's individuals that are sitting just as cold in their heart because jesus has never been in their boat oh they heard the word and they went off without him they went out on mission they went out to do this they went out to do great things they went out to fulfill a commission but they didn't have jesus and then the winds begin to blow and trouble comes and they ain't no jesus in the ship to awake but all hope isn't lost because he's not going to lose one of his and in the darkness of the night in the darkest hour jesus comes along walking on the water that's trying to destroy you because every devil is under his feet [Applause] [Music] hallelujah and you know what that did that gave peter faith to say if that's you lord you know they began to cry that might be a spirit oh and they were afraid some were afraid of the new birth some are afraid of the new movement of the spirit some are afraid they might be called pentecostal to have all the word hello oh we got the perfect word not without the gifts of the spirit you don't you just got a portion i'm gonna rest a minute water and let you think gotta water the camel now as we think about it they don't have jesus he ain't there why he never been there and so long they can't even remember when they got the commission to go and they went without him they thought they got a commission to go they got a great message they thought god sent a great message and the seal was open here they go running here they go sailing away we're going to tell everybody and jesus is not in your boat but he ain't losing one of his and he's up watching from a high heel and he sees the trouble that you're in and he ain't going to leave none of his children out even though you did a stupid thing to go without him amen he ain't going to leave you out he's coming to you hallelujah amen and he's not a spook and he's not a spirit obie is but not a bad one he's a holy spirit and if you look if you just cry out to him he'll make you walk on your waters peter said if that's you didn't become well it's me come on well he gets out there and he walks on the waters but jesus still isn't in his boat and you might have great faith and be able to do great things and have great things happen and this and that but unless jesus gets in your boat you're still in trouble because any time you get your eyes off of him you're going to sink but he's the god of second chances he's the god of third chances he's the god of four chances he's the god of many chances he's the god that's calling on your heart this morning because he's a god rich in mercy [Applause] and all peter had to do is get his eyes back on jesus and say lord help me i perished and he lifted him out and immediately they were in the boat isn't it wonderful when one finally gets jesus in their boat you know then their storm begins to cease they can sail through troubled waters i mean drug women popularity money whatever it is will never drag you down again it'll never seek your boat because you got jesus in the boat [Applause] amen you get jesus in the boat you have the birth of the word you can have a tongue speaking acts 2 38 blabbering screaming shouting experience that will make you walk on the very waters that was about to drown you and jesus will lift you up and let you walk on the waters again even after you've fallen isn't he a god reaching mercy even after you got your eyes off of him he'll reach right down there for you once again and then you'll have jesus in your boat because immediately he'll come to the boat with you [Music] and when he gets in the boat the storm ceases peace a wonder for peace oh now coming down from the father above don't want to sing too much because you'll think i'm quitting preaching i ain't i just now started to fight i'm just getting my second win [Applause] the disciples found himself at the end of the road you know we're having trouble covert 19. so i'm i'm not even going to repeat their gossip it ain't worthy of talking about they can't handle the word they i can't rightly divide it so they mess it all up but let me just say it this way cold at 19 don't mean you don't have the token that's a lie from the pits of hell and you can tell them jesus said it through tim pruitt we get sick we get cancers we got troubles yet we're still christians it has nothing to do with the soul but brother branham talks about it they were having a rest between revivals and there you know jesus was taking a rest and they were resting and they were testifying oh you remember oh my that mighty story about that little colored lady down there in memphis tennessee where she called elijah down out of the skies to come to her need because god was trying to show you you don't have to be rich and affluent and a big somebody you can be the poorest of the poorest but your prayer can move jesus where elijah will come to your door or his servant whatever it is oh we've testified my overseas you know why you know that boy he's dancing on a chain and thinking he wants to do tricks and he's all crippled up and everything else and and in one moment's time he jumps up and all his bones cracked and he's healed and has a right mind god can still heal the the not popular to use that word why they call that now handicapped he can god can heal and restore it all a man takes one moment of believing him it can be a newborn christian just lays their hands over on their little child and here and comes back amen it doesn't take the great and the mighty just takes one believer they're the great and almighty because the humblest of god's believers so well brother tim i don't know if god will even hear my prayers i just don't know well you know sometimes we get it so we get so out of touch with how this god responds to the need of humanity if i don't tell this right menthon you forgive me but i'll just tell it as i've been told we got a doctor in town that was not well let's just put it this way he had a filthy mouth he was uh he was a a pain management doctor and back surgeon and he didn't have good bedside manners and was rude he got coveted 19 they put him down finally in a respirator how many days was that 41 days 41 days when he finally got come out and got loose of it he looked over to the attendant physician he said you know something very strange happened six times i went into a very very dark room and he said my father-in-law an old doctor he was a heart surgeon there noted man in shreveport when i did some of the first heart surgeries and things i understand in our area he's deceased and he came to him six times and said when you go back you get your life right six times he went in that dark room six times he's told that he comes up and he tells us a tendon physician and the doc says six times your heart stopped beating and six times i brought you back and he turns and he says and while i was on the ventilator there was a time i could see and i could look around and i thought it was angels but it was people and they were praying and that's because there was a prayer chain going around for this man that would god would heal him because god hears prayers and today he's come out of it and some of our church members whose visit to office says now there's gospel music playing in the office now he prays with them and says god bless you and you think that i've got to only do something for you and me no god's a god who's got a great big heart who'll reach out to the church to the bride to the lust to the dying because he's a god-rich and mercy you may think the day of grace is over that's because you become so great and mighty in your own way in your own thinking you think you can close the door but god says i still got it open listen i'll take it i don't care what denomination he belongs to today i'll take it there's going to be some of them that will be part of the church and they're the redeemed they're in the book of life you know what i mean by redeemed they're in the book of redemption that's what i mean that's all i mean now but he's been taking a rest between revivals and and there there's another revival coming you know again you know and he says brother branham says that we're resting between revivals could remind the people around the world that's what we've been doing we have been resting between revivals you know brother brandon said we are looking for another stir where there's got to be something happen that calls the church that will gather the church together he he says there's there's another surge that is coming and of course we can look back at the revival past oh there was miracles and other and let me just remind you there's not going to be another worldwide sweeping revival like that it's over this next revival this revival that we're in is taking the bride home to glory that's why brother adam would say i am looking for another surge of the spirit the coming of the lord he said again in the token he said i'm looking for a break forth time of break forth there's the spirit of god in these last days that we're living in for another surge of the holy spirit into the church for rapture and faith just before it comes and everything is sitting straight in order and i believe we're at the time now that the word should have preeminence and we've had 50 plus years and of course there's been a lot of storming hours but i want to remind you he says again there will be an outboard this is after 63. there will be a big outpouring of the spirit yes to grab that church and take her in the skies exactly see because the church the word the bride in christ's ministry is is it is in his bride which is his body and let me just paraphrase it this way the supernatural body the spiritual body abuse here on the earth his spirit is in there living his life right out until him and the church becomes one for the wedding that's what he says and what shall i do with jesus called christ god's little flock that believes the word is mechanics is ready too it's ready for the dynamics to set it forth with the holy spirit so i'm looking for another shaking god's gonna send another shaken this chapter 63 in jeffersonville for those of you that like it to be there by the way he said go compel him to come in there's still room they may be in the highways and the byways but there's still room at the table you say brother to him as why is a rapture waiting so long hey i wanted it when i was a 15 year old boy preacher 50 years ago but god has made it wait for you and you and you and you and you and you because he's not going to leave a hook behind [Applause] there's still room and i believe maybe in the next few months or something a year or whatever it is god is going to send another shaking across the country for there's still somebody out there somewhere that's a predestinated seed that the light has to fall on somewhere in the world it might be someone like philip who tried and tried and tried to do this on his own but one day the light struck the seed come on somebody and my one day you know a child of god can go a long time the prophet of god said before that seed germinates but god's got an hour god's got a time god does these things to give a hope for somebody else hey man he'll listen he'll let my wife have a brain bleed to give hope for somebody else that god can still heal brain bleed he'll let another have cancer and heal to sow and give hope to somebody else that they're still a god of miracles and god will god will let one come in and there to come this way in that way and just make partial steps and make a big mess out of everything and then turn around and make be god rich in mercy and take a guy like philip who had time after time and youth camp after youth camp and altar called after alzheim but one day in the presence of god a she germinated something he always wanted in his heart and it's never been the same yeah the same with you sherman gave you another chance vicki because he's of god reaching mercy i could have him pop up all over this building a god who cares he'll get you some way come on amen you say oh brother tim i'd like to have that i'd like to have that experience like that doctor did you don't have to have that experience you got a preacher to preach to you you got an angel in the pulpit to bring you a message to tell you today is the day of salvation and you can turn from darkness to life and brother branham said god is going to send another satan across the country where there's somebody still out there somewhere that's a predestinated seed i pray it'll be someone will look around and say you know i've been and i went off without jesus and i'm shaken because of all of this but i see one coming walking on the water that i want in my boat so i can walk on my waters too hallelujah it might be some of you huh sitting in a message pew been in a backslid lukewarm condition for years and your jesus is asleep in your life in your soul oh yeah you really got the holy ghost but it's been so long since you've made real contact with it and you need to shake it just shake that jesus wake up that jesus wake up that holy [Applause] spirit some are going to be like samson you know wake up they're pinching me this my strength has gone from me and i'll go as loud as i did before but there's going to be others that's going to come back and say my hair's growing out everything the devil robbed from me the power is coming back i'm making seven locks out of it now for all the ages are finished and i'm clothed with a nazarite vow oh just once more lord just once more send your power brother branham said we find in every walk of life salesmen that claim to be salesmen they're not electricians claim to be electricians they're not mechanics who claim to mechanics and not we find men who claim to be christians and are not jesus plainly stated what a christian was these signs have followed them that believe what they would do what the believing church would do we can claim we're bride and not be it because if the signs don't follow it we're just making an empty statement and an empty claim but the signs must follow them that believe the signs of a believing church there will be miracles there will be healing there will be a genuine atmosphere of the holy ghost there will be gifts of the spirit there will be genuine christians living and overcoming life [Applause] that's what will be in a believing church these disciples they've been bragging some are bragging on this theology wow man when he poked us broke the seals and man that seventh seal man i've got part one and part two and part 10 and part 27 seal a seven seal is seventh seal this and seven seal this and you can see their titles seven seals and they're trying to convince you they really believe in the seventh seal but they never had the coming they're preaching about the coming but never had the coming they're over here in the ship they're talking about all of these other things they know there was a revival we have the seals the thunders we understand predestination the difference between that and free moral agency and we've been back and we've talked about it and you know like i said the big one the seventh seal we're we're not we're not first and second paul believers we got the word so we're third paul believers oh well where's the signs of that where is the power of salvation that brings conviction to young center boys and girls and they fall on their knees to repent and give and then live an overcoming life why is porn still a problem with them why are they so caught up in video games they have no appetite for the word and they're born again where's the power to change atmospheres to speak to the storms so divorces aren't happening in our churches amen where where's the power of healing where the word goes forth and remove tumors before the doctor's hands touch them if you're not the third pull word then let's see it manifest oh we've had a great revival and then a great cooling off oh yeah resting between revivals we can remember some remembers the miracles the dead baby that was raised down in mexico and man man what a prophet what a miracle what a what what a mighty god worked through that man oh my those days those days what a what am what a man other over here what a great doctrine what a great truth we got today and oh my we dissect it and trisect it and we splice it up and jam this quote with that one and jam that one until we got something that the brother branham didn't even say and we become so great we can interpret now what's between the line that we can got something new and say things that ain't even on the line are you with me amen amen but that's when trouble starts when the church forgets about the presence of jesus christ when we forget and begin to stew and fast and make little denominations that are tighter than uh than even the denominations out there till it becomes us four and no more that's where the trouble starts but as long as christ is there and the holy spirit is blessing the people you know we don't care what color or creed that it is you know we're all one great pool of god's blessing we're just fellowshipping on the blood but when we begin to think we're the biggest church my ministry's got more views than yours well i've had more hits on facebook than you have all the other things you know we got intellectual trained men that can bring a script bring out a message you can hardly lay a finger on it but brother brandon said what i want to know is where is that manifestation see intellectual sermons and we're tired of intellectual sermons [Music] we're tired of preacherettes with sermonettes that produces christianettes we want real things not the intellectual giants who know the greek and put it together intellectually and yet their heart has never really been changed but jesus said lo i'm with you always let's talk about that for a moment there's so many things that we can speak about just for a moment but what did he say what did he say why don't we try hebrews 13 5. let's just look at that for a moment let me just bring this up let me just try this for a minute let your the way you live be without covetousness be content with such things as you have for he has said i will never leave thee not for safety does he keep his promise is he true to his word is somebody with me yet amen what does he say in matthew let's try to say matthew is it 2820 right there where where he says or yes that's good he says lo i am with you always even to the end of the world right down here to the end of the end of the end to the end of the end i'm with you always amen jesus is in the ship even unlike tabernacle i want you to know jesus is in the ship we can talk about things oh yes oh my that day atlanta run around the church that day this happened that day when the holy spirit swept through my room and my wife's blindness went away and little drew got up out of the floor and never walked at 18 months old and ran around the house when trouble comes to your house when the doctor says your daughter's got cancer your wife your child you you've got then you get fearful and afraid well i could really believe when it was happening in brother tim's house and happening in the buttz's house and happening in the dexter's house and happened over here and there when it happened over in the oglesby's house and kidneys were restored and i believe that i i knew it can happen for you god bless you brother but when he comes to your house that's when you're going to want to wake jesus that's when you're going to have to reach over there and say i don't need a rest anymore i need a revival that's when you need another shaking and say shake me lord amen and where your faith begins to rise up come on are you with me church amen will you begin to say jesus don't you care that we perish yeah he cares he's been waiting for you to care for you to start caring hey there's cancer in the church and they've been laying there sick and not be healed but now they're here in my house amen there's this problem but now i'm faced with it i want jesus to come alive and i'll tell you there's only one thing that will bring jesus to jesus in your life to cognates and recognition and back to the forefront again and that's your faith and when your lips begin to move and you begin to call on him with faith that jesus begins to rise up and face your storm and say why did you doubt you've had me all the time i've been there all the time i filled you with the holy ghost i put my life in you call me anytime no i'm with you always [Applause] even to the end of the world you need a revival it doesn't matter whether you got him in your boat or he ain't in your boat you need a revival right here sitting people jesus ain't in your boat and right here there's people jesus is in their boat but right here there's people no matter which condition you're in you need to recognize your need of him in the forefront of your life again and get your eyes off your storm and get your eyes back on jesus there's hydrogen bombs atomic bombs whatever they are there's bombs with our name on it korea's got them they're working on them over here in the arab countries supposedly israel's got them it's a secret yeah they got them secret's pretty well out the united states has got russ has got them everybody's got them they can blow this world to bits politics rotten to the core whether you're dim a rat or somebody that should be canned you're in a mess the world's in a mess there's storms on every side kobet is raging through the country it's only the first precursor of plagues that are coming they're only going to get worse financial crisis on the horizon there's nothing sure there's storms everywhere and your marriage ain't going to hold together without god don't matter who you are you gotta have jesus and your children gonna stray unless you get an old-fashioned altar back in your home and make it the very goal of your life to raise children for god instead of your stupid career but one day you're going to look and say how stupid was i you cannot remain where you're at we're in a time where he's sending another shaking everything that can be shaken will be shaken the only thing that's built on the word of god is what's going to survive it oh yeah we got trouble satan blows his poisonous breath until days and miracles are passed and ain't no such thing as divine healing and the church by and large sits in a backslidden condition and maybe that's where you're at this morning why does god let these things happen why does it happen like that why does he let trouble come to your door and it will you can sit back and smuggle oh hallelujah i got the token and ain't nothing coming oh yeah it will because you're human that's why it comes not because you're a christian that ain't why it comes it comes because you're human and all humans get it you're corporal and your body and is immune to everything but did you know that just as your as the winds and waves had to obey his will your body has to obey his will hallelujah that when his word speaks to your storm in your life come on your body will obey cancers will leave you you know why because greater is he that is in you that he that's in the world and there is in your life and he's there to rise up but your faith has to call him back to the forefront you may be sitting here with heart trouble god don't heal you might be dead before the morning why we let the sick lay when we were told to cast out devils how come youth camp we cast out ten demonic manifestations why is it that our youth aren't getting the holy ghost instead they're getting full of devils that we're dealing with in prayer lines why is it he's proved over and over again that he really gives the baptism of the holy ghost he proves again and again he cast out devils he he told us you know our official commission is to cast satan out and a church that is not casting satan out is not of god because how satan sinners are saved you cast out satan people are healed it's all casting out the devil it must have dawned on some of them that the creator was still with them i hope they're coming dawning to you this morning that the creator is still with us because he said i'll never leave you or forsake you amen they awakened jesus they called him on the scene they'd seen many things done and the words words vindicate him and so we and he was not hard to call into action you know why because our faith brings christ into our presence what a promise that is amen when your lips begin to move and you begin to call on god when you begin to knock when you begin to seek when you begin to ask and when the church begins to call and seek and ask it awake the jesus that's in the midst amen and he'll cause you a man to walk on your waters he'll cause the seeds that were boisterous and the winds that were blowing to become steel and sickness will begin to leave and diseases will leave your body and while the word is preached hands won't even have to be laid on you but you can be healed or saved or delivered or you can find a place at an altar where it can happen but it's going to happen the revival the rest i want to say this the rest is about over it's time to wake him he's rested long enough between the revivals we're about to have another revival don't you miss it it'll be the last revival it will not be a worldwide sweeping known revival it'll be a revival where the holy spirit surges through the church and we're changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye and we caught up to meet the lord in the air why don't we bow our heads together his ministry has never ceased brother branham was asked the question how do you wake christ by believing his word faith brings him on the scene that's what brings him on the scene faith then call on him to confirm his word and don't doubt and fear don't do it don't do that just believe him as it's written and let it be done and god will prove to you that jesus christ he is the same yesterday today and forever i wonder while our heads are bowed and our eyes are closed and we're thinking about it how many that would be out there where whichever condition you're in that you need to you need to you need to call jesus you need to call jesus to your boat you know you're sinking maybe there's others that says i know i got jesus he's been in my boat i didn't leave without him but today i need an awakening i needed awakening how many people around this place would say i need a revival i need a revival i need a revival here's one of our elder deacons here kneeling at the altar today that might be you today that needs to be at an altar too i remember the place i remember the time when he was a young man 30 years old had a little family the holy spirit moved when i was preaching the church age series and god that filled him with the holy ghost took things out of his life but today he's wanting a revival today he's wanting a renewing of the spirit well what about you

gonna fall apart your home's gonna fall apart satan's gonna strike your home things are already happening you can see the signs but you want right now you want to awake that jesus in your ship a jesus with a faith can calm troubled waters that can move your mountains they can heal all diseases oh he's here this morning he said i'll never leave you or forsake you but i'll be with you even to the end of the world amen i know i know i'm still speaking but it don't hurt you to call out to him the bible said that those that call on the name of the lord they shall be saved you just call out upon him
