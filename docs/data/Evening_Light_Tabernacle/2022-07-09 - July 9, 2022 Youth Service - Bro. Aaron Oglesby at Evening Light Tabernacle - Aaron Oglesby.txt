the Great [Music] foreign [Music] I'm so thankful that he did that for me because I had plenty of faults and plenty of failures but One Moment In His presence can take care of all those things amen I I believe that we may just call this a youth Service as it were tonight but I've learned to not take any opportunity in his presence for granted you've made the effort and you've come so put everything you've got into it put everything you've got into it and recognize that this is an opportunity to draw closer to him this is an opportunity at eternal life that these aren't just gathering for the sake of gathering but that our God wants to speak to you for a little bit tonight and I I believe he will if you have your Bibles with you we want to turn to the book of Acts the fourth chapter and it may be a little different I was talking with brother Timothy in the back and I and I wasn't looking a certain way but then in my studies I came across a certain thing which led me down a certain path and then I was like well we're just going to go down all these paths and and get it done um so it may there may be a transition where it seems as if we we shift gears and that is that is the case with this and I just want to be real with you tonight let's just uh shake off the awkward feelings and just you know these are the same people that we gather with every Sunday there's the same people that we fellowship with at youth Gatherings these are the same people so we can just relax and be ourselves and talk genuinely tonight and just ask the Lord to come and have his way uh acts 4 32 says in the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul neither said any of them that alt of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things in common and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them all neither was there any among them that lacked for as many as were possessors of lands and houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold and laid them down at the apostles feet and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need and Joseph that's also translated Joseph who by the apostles was surname Barnabas which is being interpreted the son of consolation a levite and of the country of Cyprus having land sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet amen let's talk to the Lord real quick Lord Jesus Lord in this moment I just asked you to come take control of me Lord settle my nerves Lord you see the things that laid him before us Lord the seriousness of them I just pray that you had helped me to deliver Lord exactly the way it was given Lord I pray right now that you would help each one of these young people to push through and enter in Lord and recognize their need of you Lord in the in the day that they're living in Lord each one of us each day in our own personal lives need more of you father Lord I just pray that you'll help us to recognize that and just to press in Lord for there's more of you that is available to us tonight Lord I pray that you take control now bless the reading of your word Lord and just take control of this vessel in Jesus name we pray amen amen you may have your seats tonight foreign right here in chapter four of Acts we're getting a look into the early church there at Jerusalem in Chapter 2 we have just seen the The Upper Room experience we've just come through that that portion of history as it were we see 120 there filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost on that exact same day we see 3 000 that are added to the kingdom as Peter stands up and begins to preach and says they were pricked in their hearts so there's 120 filled with the Holy Ghost and then that same day three thousand are added to the kingdom early on in chapter four we see 5 000 who believe and are and are added to the kingdom there are amazing things taken place here in the early days of that first church in the book of Acts Jesus is being preached by the apostles and many are believing and the gospel is spreading like wildfire it was an amazing time to be a part of the of the church and to be a part of this movement resurrection power is being manifested amongst the Believers it's being demonstrated in a mighty way and and healings are taking place and there's deliverances taking place there are Mighty prayer lines that are happening in one place brother Brownell makes the statement he says the prayer lines were so big that they ended up just laying the sick people out in the street and the scripture says they line the streets with the sick and with The Afflicted it says that sick folks and Afflicted folks and people with unclean spirits were being brought to the apostles and every one of them were being healed and every one of them were being delivered it's a it's a wonderful time as we're coming up to even this scripture reading that we just read in in chapter four in chapter 3 we've just seen the lame man at the gate called beautiful and he has just been healed and they come up to him and he's a beggar and he has need of something he just doesn't recognize that there's more available to him than what he's even willing to ask for how many times do we in a church service sit there and not realize there's more Force available than what we're even asking for maybe we're looking just for some rejoicing or for a shout or I hope this special goes good and I hope the preacher preaches good but there's a lot more available to you tonight than maybe you even realize when you came in the door and that's the situation that the beggar finds himself in he's wanting money he's wanting something temporary he's wanting something from them that might buy his next meal that might pay a bill he's wanting something but there's much more available to him than what he realizes in that moment and he's sitting there and he looks at him and his eyes fall upon him and then maybe he sticks his cup up or whatever it is that he has and Peter says to him Silver and Gold Have I None but what I have I give unto thee I wonder how many of us tonight are in a situation that we can give somebody Jesus how many of us are in a condition tonight that we can actually offer them Jesus because we have Jesus to give you know if you don't have Jesus you can't give Jesus you might can tell somebody about Jesus you might can tell them about a Doctrine but if you don't have Jesus in your heart if you don't have the Holy Ghost for yourself you can't give somebody Jesus notice he didn't begin to teach him a Doctrine about the resurrection notice he didn't he didn't begin to explain why the man's current belief system in the Jewish religion was wrong and he didn't launch into a sermon about the revelation of the godhead this isn't how Peter responded to him but Peter has just come from an upper room experience Peter has just come from a place where Jesus the one he used to walk with the one that used to talk to him he used to travel with and fellowship with where that one has now come to live on the inside of Peter and he is in a position to not just tell this man about Jesus he's in a position to give this man Jesus he's in a position to pass on what it is that's been given to him that's the place we got to get to to where the one that we've heard about the one we've talked about the one that's been preached to us becomes so real on the inside of us that it's something that we can give to other people it's something we can share with them Beyond a correct Doctrine Beyond we got this lined up and this lined up but there is a living God there is a real God there is a Deliverance for you there is a healing for you there is a real Jesus and you can share him because you yourself possess him that very one was now living on the inside of Peter pardon me while I looked for some water and because of that he could share Jesus it's got to be more than stories to us tonight young people it's got to be more than we live different we have a different lifestyle we have correct Doctrine it's got to be more than that to you this is a Dying World that you're living in this is a hungry world that you're living in this is a thirsty world that we're living in and listen it's good to tell somebody about the message it's good to tell somebody that there's a living God but can we demonstrate a living God to them because a living God is living on the inside of us can you do more than tell them can you demonstrate it two of the world you know before this moment before the upper room Peter was a coward Peter was afraid of what he believed before this Peter would deny what it is that he believed but now because of the upper room experience there's a boldness on the inside of him there's a courage on the inside of him we see him over in chapter five and he's actually he's leaving and he's actually rejoicing because he's been beaten and scourged and he's rejoicing that that he's been found worthy to suffer shame for Jesus the very thing he ran from the very thing he was afraid of the very thing he couldn't stand and take the shame he couldn't stand and take the criticism and now a little bit later we see he's rejoicing because of this because it's not Peter anymore it's not Peter trying to overcome anymore this is a new guy this is a new person it's now Christ Living on the inside of him it's not just stories anymore but there's somebody living the life through him listen if you haven't been to the upper room yet you got to get there if you haven't had your own Upper Room experience you have to have it it'll change everything about the way you live about the way you talk about the struggles you have it won't be a struggle anymore it won't be hard to give things up anymore it won't be hard for you to come to church and worship God anymore or put down your filthy movies and your filthy music and the things that you struggle to lay down it won't be anymore because it won't be you doing it but Jesus Christ on the inside of you will overcome those things in your life when you have your own Upper Room the devil has no Authority in your life anymore that Upper Room experience is a game changer it changes everything about the situations and the way you deal with them and how you struggle or don't struggle with the things of the world anymore you know the book of Acts is it's such an incredible read I encourage you to go and read it and if you haven't and if you have read it again because we preach that we're part of another book of Acts we preach that a repeat of the book of Acts and yet many times we don't know what all's in the book of Acts but if you're going to repeat something and you're going to be something and brother Branham would say that that's the mold that's the model that's the pattern then we ought to know what's in there we ought to know what's in there and I encourage you to get into it and as I was reading through in chapter four there was something here that jumped out to me as I was looking at this in verse 32 where we started it says and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul now here's where we're just going to talk real for a little while to our youth group I began to look through and I went back to Acts 2 and it says they were all in one Accord it says they had singleness of heart chapter 5 verse 12 they were all in one Accord just before it begins to tell all about all the healings and all the deliverances and I began to see a pattern that when God moved and when great things happened and when people were healed and when these things would pour out they were always in one mind one Accord singleness of heart singleness of mind it even said in that one place of one soul this is kind of hard to Fathom for a group of human beings because I I understand that you don't have to read too much further you get over into chapter seven and Beyond and you do begin to see some of the humanity and you do begin to see some of the disagreements amongst the Believers but early on in the book of Acts this is this is a theme that they have the same goal they have the same mindset they're striving for the same thing and what happens when we have the same goals and when our goals are the same then what we do is we don't focus on our differences when our goals are the same and when our focus is the same we're not noticing every little thing about people around us that we may not like or we like this about this and then we don't like this and this one gets on my nerves you're not focused on the same goals your vision has become clouded by Humanity instead of getting your eyes on the goal those little things and those differences are no longer your focus when everyone is focused on the same thing and I began to think about our youth group and not in a negative way I begin to think about how incredible our youth group really is how awesome it is that we have this group of young people and I thought about how the devil would love to get in how the devil would love to get in amongst this youth group and began to call strife and begin to cause Petty differences and begin to cause us to not be able to let go of this little thing that we took as a slight or this little thing was said or I wasn't invited to this and begin to allow strife and things to build up in our life how the devil would love to come in and cause division amongst friends cause some to feel that they have no friends cause us to draw up tight and not let others into our group or to cause some little disagreement or some little personality conflict to come between what should be strong relationships Now understand I'm not even saying these things from the standpoint of this is what's going on I'm saying these things from the standpoint of don't let these things happen don't allow these things to begin to creep into our lives and to allow Division and things to push to some degree these are all natural things that you're going to deal with in life whether it's at work whether it's at school whether it's within your own family whether it's I don't want to go to the family reunion because I don't like ants so and so let's be honest these are all real things brother Aaron ain't walking around just loving everybody just trying to get it out there that I'm not putting this off on you I understand I get it we don't just want to be best friends with everybody in the world or let's bring it down with everybody in our church can we be honest we're not always going to be best friends with everybody that's not how life works I keep looking over here like there's somebody sitting there but there ain't that's just not how things work these are real things that you're going to deal with I get that but the devil has a real interest in working more amongst churches specifically amongst youth to cause bickering to cause infighting to cause trouble I've seen entire families turn against each other because a kid in this family and a kid in this family have issues families that used to be best friends families that were super close but because of infighting amongst the youth turn against one another and then the youth has to choose sides and then the church has to choose sides and then oh but you didn't hear the whole story oh girl you don't even know what I heard about it dude listen I was there I saw it next thing you know everybody saw it these are real things hey 15 years Middle School I get it saw it every single day so I know how these things can come in oh yeah but I heard and then the church begins to choose sides and it's all over something that the devil would like to do to come in to tear apart and at the root of it it's usually nothing but what happens in the course of the whole situation is it causes all of us to get our eyes off of our same common goal get our eyes off of our same common enemy we begin to forget that we're in a battle and that your brother and your sister is not will not will never be your enemy we have but one enemy is the devil and we have but one goal and it's a Rapture it's the change of our bodies but you can't get there until you have your own Upper Room experience and once you get that and you get full of the Holy Ghost and you get focused on the Holy Ghost and then your concern becomes seeing your friends get the holy ghost seeing the others in the youth group get the holy ghost seeing your family on fire with the Holy Ghost when your goal becomes the Holy Ghost those other things fall away from you those other things are no longer your focus and I realize that we're human and where there are humans there will always be differences where there are humans there will always be times of not seeing eye to eye the reality is in a group this big we're not all going to be best friends those are just facts however what I see here in the early church is that their common goal was their focus in other words their differences were no longer their focus the fact that this one just really annoyed Peter isn't listed in the book of Acts don't tell me people didn't annoy Peter he strikes me as somebody that was easily annoyed but it's not recorded there in the book of Acts oh this one just really got on Andrew's nerves I know right it happens but it's not recorded because it wasn't there Focus you don't read anywhere where yesterday on Facebook juicy well they couldn't have posted that but let's bring it tired yesterday on Facebook you see what so-and-so posted and then you spend so much time talking about the person that posted something stupid on Facebook that you're no better than they are listen when you talk about the people doing the gossiping you're a gossiper it's true stuff it's real talk these things they were able to lay aside because they had one Focus Jesus Jesus was their focus they'd been in the upper room they received the Holy Spirit and they wanted others to receive the same Holy Spirit that's all they cared about their focus was on the holy ghost that is being poured out in the early church and not just that they could have more of it and they wanted it but their focus was how can I get others to it how can I spread this gospel how can I show someone how can it be demonstrated we want the world to know he's risen he's resurrected he is a living God and that was their focus the fact that this one was too dramatic and this one over here was too loud that wasn't their focus the fact that this one well that one she just likes to act so grown up well that's just because you're so immature so of course I seemed growing up to you that wasn't their focus and see the thing is we have to stop and realize raise your hand in here if you're 13. I know I got one I got two raise your hand in here if you're you're 21 or older age difference in our youth group we go from 13 to well you don't ever really get kicked out you got a big age group you're going to have all kind of differences there's going to be things that get on your nerves but your focus is I want them to get Jesus I want to get them to the Holy Ghost I want to pray through with them at the altar I want to be there for them when they need somebody to talk to this is the youth group this is who we are this is what we are laying aside our differences laying aside the fact maybe we don't hang out all through the week but when the opportunity comes I'll be there for you when the opportunity comes I'll pray with you I'll pray for you I want to see you get the same thing I got and that is their focus they laid aside these things so that the common goal could be reached I'm gonna say it again we're not all gonna be best friends we're not all going to be invited to every event we're not all going to be invited to every birthday I don't need to be invited to your house let's bring it down to what I'm really saying you invite who you want to spend the night with you that ain't what this is about you invite who you want to your birthday party I do yeah no yep nope yep no it's being honest that's not what this is about you have who you won't go shopping with you please don't ask me I don't like shopping but you get my point we all do those things I'm not asking you to not have your circle of friends that's natural but when we are at church come on now with me or when we're at a youth meeting or when everyone gets together to play volleyball or whatever the case may be listen that's not the time to be cliquish that's not the time to gather up in the corner with your little group of friends that's not the time to go stand over here with your little group of friends that's not the time to be excluding people it's not the time to make someone feel awkward and unwanted here now I'm not trying to control your life at home that's not what this is about but here this is the time that we are all best friends we have gathered for a common cause and a common purpose to let each other know we're not alone and we're standing together and we're fighting together and we have one common cause we have one goal when we get here that's how we treat each other this is the time in these few hours in the gym or here in the church where we move beyond our personal likes we move beyond our funny feelings about this person or our funny feelings about that person which we all have but we moved beyond that for a few hours and we hug the neck of somebody that maybe we don't usually hug or we go out of our way to say something kind to someone that we don't usually speak to these times these moments is when everyone should know I am loved I am wanted I am a part I'm not trying to be funny I can't necessarily help it what you do on Tuesday or Thursday I'm not telling you to invite the youth group over for a sleepover I know wouldn't work I'm not trying to control your friend group I'm saying when we're together as the evening like Tabernacle youth every one is apart everyone is our friend everyone is on the same side everyone should have the same goal everyone should feel wanted everyone should feel loved everyone should feel like they are apart one thing I've seen for years in the school system and how easy it is for someone to fall through the cracks to be forgotten about reach out to that person let them feel noticed or cared about even if it's just for a little bit we all have that group that we're close to me too I have my group of friends we all have friend groups that's fine we're not looking to break those up but when we come together let's be together one heart as it says there in the book of Acts One Soul one goal yeah brother Aaron our group is so varied in age and different families different ideas different backgrounds it's easy you know it's hard to hang out with that person and it's hard it's hard for this and listen I want to read something that they wrote about that first church it says they were all of one heart they were all of one's Soul though there were many very many of different ages tempers and conditions in the world who perhaps before they believed were perfect strangers to one another yet when they met in Christ when they met in Christ they were as intimately acquainted as if they had known one another for many years perhaps they had been of different sex among the Jews before their conversion or had had discords upon civil accounts but now these were all forgotten laid aside and they were unanimous in the Faith of Christ and being all joined to the Lord they were joined to one another in Holy Love they had become so dedicated to the cause of Christ that all those other things were set aside and now as we begin to move from this point because we're staying in the same scripture but there's going to be a little bit of Shifting Gears here they became so dedicated to the cause of Christ that they begin to sell off their goods they began to sell off their homes they begin to sell off their lands and they began to give the money to the apostles for the purpose that the that the cause of Christ might go forward that the gospel might be preached that those in need might might be taken care of they begin to sell their houses and brother Brown said God would use this in a mighty way because when persecution came they didn't even have a house to go back to so because of that they had to run from place to place to place to place spreading the gospel everywhere that they went they gave everything they had they gave all for Jesus Christ they were so taken up with the hope of an inheritance in another world that they cared little for the things of this world their focus was on things of another world now here we are young people and here's where I want to get focused in they were so focused on the next life that giving up things in this life was very easy for them but brother Aaron I'm struggling to give this up it's because your focus isn't on the next life yet brother Aaron I'm struggling with this type of music or I'm struggling with this issue or I'm struggling with this lust your focus isn't on the next life your focus is too much on this life your focus is on a temporary life when your focus gets on that and it gets on that reward and it gets on eternity it's easy to give things up here it's easy to lay things down here well I'm just struggling to give these things up it's because your focus isn't on the right life yet your focus is on this life you're still seeing the pleasure of sin in this life your focus hasn't shifted yet there in our scripture reading we see a man named Barnabas whose sole Focus was on the Holy Ghost his Focus was on getting others to the Holy Ghost so he sold his land he laid the money at the apostles feet Barnabas would become a very renowned man in the early church a man looked up to not because he sought it but because he was a man that lived what he preached he was a man that had a testimony he was a man that didn't just tell people about the Lord Jesus but he demonstrated it and even became a man that was renowned he was an example he was one to follow after he gave everything for the cause he became a colleague of Paul and traveled and ministered the the apostles they respected him he had titles such as son of Prophecy son of exhortation son of consolation he was one known to walk in and live in and be full of the Holy Ghost we see him all throughout the Book of Acts here's one example Acts chapter 11 verse 22 then Tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem and they sent forth Barnabas that he should go as far as Antioch who when he came and had seen the grace of God was glad and exhorted them all that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord for he was a good man and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith and much people were added unto the Lord we see these Works in barnabas's life we see his rewards we see a fruitful Ministry coming out of his life but the first thing we saw with Barnabas was in our scripture reading before we saw the rewards and before we saw his big name and this big Ministry and in full of the Holy Ghost and going around doing these things we saw that he gave all we saw that he gave everything and he laid it down that's the First Act we see in barnabas's life it's not a prayer meeting it's not Healing The Sick it's not the power of God father it's born of his coming and given everything he had now would be a good time to tell you what we're going to preach on since we're about halfway through pretending you gave all pretending you gave all Barnabas didn't have to pretend he laid everything he had down at the feet of the Apostles and listen with Barnabas we're talking about money Barnabas was giving money from selling a piece of land but that's not what I'm talking about with you here today today we're talking about being willing to die out to sin giving up the things of the world giving up your own personal Ambitions surrendering all that you are to him not holding back a little bit for yourself but everything you have I'm going to come and I'm going to lay it down at the feet of Jesus that you might receive a greater reward that you might receive the greatest reward and that is eternal life that you might receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost I hadn't got the Holy Ghost Yet brother Aaron have you given him everything have you laid everything down have you turned your back on everything of the world in all the pleasures is there anything you're holding back Barnabas didn't he laid everything down you have to lay it all down tonight you can't play games young people and expect to make it you can't pretend and expect to make it you can't hang out with those that aren't sold out and claim you are sold out you can't do it oh I'm just trying to influence my friends that is a lie that is not truth it got real quiet if you hang out with people not sold out it's because you're not sold out fact supposed to shun them no nobody said anything about shunning anybody I literally just spent 30 minutes explaining to you how you're supposed to be one same heartbeat Same Soul but there's time and there's place there's plenty of opportunity to show that person Your Love without running all over town with them by yourself foreign thank you as truth anyhow you must be willing to lay those things down you must be willing to lay aside relationships lay aside friendships lay aside your desires lay aside your wants give all of yourself so you can be all that he has called you to be you've got to give everything to Jesus brother brother Tim made such an incredible point the other day when he was preaching about the ceiling Angel going about into towns and he says if the sealing Angel can't seal that movie you're watching kill it if the ceiling Angel can't seal that relationship kill it if the sealing Angel can't seal that friendship kill it let me get one that's more a little bit more modern that a lot of people don't talk about if the ceiling Angel can't seal those reels you're watching kill it listen it's funny to me how you may would never turn a radio on you might never turn it to a rock station country station rap station whatever station that would draw you you might never look at those things and yet you know more hit songs than most people in the world because you watch reels and 75 young people nodded because they know it's true I ain't listening or seen a real yet that didn't have a soundtrack and I ain't come across one yet that was amazing grace it's true if the ceiling Angel can't seal it you better kill it you better quit playing with things that are designed to catch you designed to trap you designed listen the devil I mean in some ways we say that dumb Old Devil but in some ways he ain't a dumb old devil in some ways he's a lot smarter than you think because he's been studying you and studying Humanity for so many years he designs things to make you think they're okay and yet you are ensnared most of you have have good heart good intentions you're fighting the battle and so you would never intentionally do those things and yet the next thing you know all you do is walk around bebopping some tune some four or five lines from a song that maybe those four or five lines are innocent but do you know what that song's about do you know what their intentions are and now okay that's fine you're walking around doing whatever saying some lines that may seem innocent some of us need to go back and listen to the sermon identification because what you're doing is you are identifying yourself with that music identifying yourself with that cause identifying yourself with the message in that song and you were saying this is who I am this is what I stand for this is what I believe listen here's a simple example I always use we know good and well that the rainbow is sent from God it's a covenant but we also knew good and well that the homosexual movement has hijacked the rainbow and it's assembled today of homosexuals how many of you are going to go get you a nice big giant rainbow and put on the back of your car and say but it's for Jesus anybody want to because why it identifies you with something I don't care what your intentions are I'm sorry but your intentions in the matter are pointless your innocence in the matter is pointless they look at it and immediately you are identified with their cause and I don't even know how we ended up here but here we are be careful what you had look I'm not saying anything I'm not trying to tell you you're evil you're bad you're I'm trying to tell you be careful what you allow to ensnare you be careful what you identify yourself with be careful who you're running around with who you're hanging out with because you're identifying yourself if I hang out with somebody all the time all the time now look I realize it's a blanket statement and you can take it to an extreme but let's have a little bit of Common Sense here in what I'm saying but if you constantly hang out with somebody it's because you identify and you can Fellowship around the same stuff around the same thoughts so if I'm with you all the time I willingly can identify that I agree with you be careful where you identify yourself we'll move on God wants all it's all of you he wants you to lay everything down and the problem that we run into as young people you know what let's forget young people as human beings as people fighting this fight the problem we run into is honesty we run into a problem of honesty honesty with ourselves and honesty with God have you given every thing and if you haven't tonight just be honest about it that's where we run into the issue is the lack of honesty God wants all of you look we serve a God who is loving we serve a God who is kind we serve a God who is merciful we serve a God that loves us so much that he came and he took on flesh he took on human battles he died for your sins and he knows that the blood works he knows the power of a surrendered life he knows the blood Works he knows it will cleanse you from sin he knows you'll overcome if you surrender to him and yet even though he paid such a price even though he knows that if you'll just surrender you'll overcome even though he knows these things he still has Amazing Grace for you when you stumble and fall short he still has Amazing Grace for you when you stumble and fall but in order to obtain that Grace there takes honesty in your heart that says Lord I've fallen short Lord I didn't give you everything Lord I didn't surrender everything I'm here to repent it takes honesty there must be honesty to receive Grace there must be an admittance Lord I fell short because I held back because I didn't give enough because I didn't surrender enough Lord I know I can give you more Lord I know I can surrender more you can't just go around falling short every day go around living in sin living lukewarm never Measuring Up and yet pretending that you gave God everything that's not how it works because if you lay it all down at his feet if you repent and there's a true repentance and you've been baptized you'll be filled with the Holy Ghost and when you're filled with the Holy Ghost you won't fall all the time you'll never you'll never stumble into sin on purpose you'll never willingly sin you'll never live a life in sin and that right there a life filled with the Holy Ghost is what happens when you lay it all down when you give him everything but a life that is pretending to give him everything will fall short Time After Time After Time After Time but I'm telling you tonight you don't got to stay in that condition you can lay it all down tonight you can put it all at his feet tonight you can say God this is everything do with it what you will and he promises to fill you with the Holy Ghost I know I can have more Lord there's an honesty I know there's more for us you see a Barnabas in the church 2022 so they're probably not named Barnabas but if they are you see a Barnabas in the church and we see that brother and we see that sister and they're so full of the Holy Ghost it's evident in their life there's fruits there there's Victory there and we want that we want that for ourselves and so maybe we emulate how they act in service we emulate the way others around us are acting when they're rejoicing and you know there's Victory there you know it's not a show but you emulate it because you want it or maybe we try to do what they did I saw them go to the altar maybe I'll go to the altar and maybe we even sacrifice some things we give up some things we go to the altar we give some worship during the service but the difference is between you and Barnabas or you and that brother and you and that sister is they gave all they gave everything they were willing to lay it all aside to receive the reward that they have and yet we want that reward and yet we want to hold on to some things we want to hold on to some of the world we want to hold on to some of those pleasures and why am I not getting it you're not going to get the same reward because you're not giving him everything you're not laying it all down they were willing to surrender and you still got those few things you want to hold on to those few things you want to hold back brother and you're saying I'm lost are you saying I'm lost no I'm saying it's time to be honest I'm saying don't put it off another day I'm saying you come to the Altar and you say Lord forgive me Lord I need more of you and because I know I need more of you Lord I've given up more of me I'm giving you everything that I've held back I'm going to lay more of myself on the Altar and I know you promised that more of you would come on the inside but you got to be willing to lay it down notice the very next verse after Barnabas has sold and given everything he's given us all wants the act of imitation because they're Desiring the same thing that Barnabas has a name he's got a Ministry it's a fruitful Ministry he's filled with the Holy Ghost they want these things they're warning that that same renown or let's just say it's it it's a a good honest desire you want that same victory you want that same Holy Ghost you want a healing you want a Deliverance there's a sacrifice made but there's also an intentional withholding look with me in Acts 5 verse 1. this is the very next verse after Barnabas has given on but a certain man named ananias with Safara his wife sold a possession they did the exact same thing Barnabas did and they're going to come and they're going to do a good thing they're going to give to the cause of Christ as a matter of fact they do give to the cause of Christ they give that the gospel might go forward they give so that the gospel can reach the world verse 2 and kept back part of the price his wife also being privy to it and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles feet but Peter said ananias why has Satan filled that heart to lie to the Holy Ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land while as it remained was it not to thine own and after it was sold was it not in thy own power why hast thou conceived this thing in that heart thou has not lied unto men but unto God and ananas hearing these words fell down and gave up The Ghost and great fear came on all them that heard these things and the young men arose and wound him up and carried him out and buried him and it was about the space of three hours after when his wife not knowing what was done came in and Peter answered unto her tell me whether you sold the land for so much and she said yay for so much in other words let me interpret this is all we have to give this is all there is she's pretending that they gave everything then Peter said unto her how is it that you have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the Lord behold the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door and shall carry thee out then fell she down straightway at his feet and yielded up The Ghost and the young man came in and found her dead and carrying her forth buried her by her husband and great fear Came Upon all the church and upon as many as heard these things what was their sin let's think about this together for a minute what was their sin not that they didn't give everything to Peter that wasn't the sin they actually gave an offering they did a good thing it's that they pretended to give everything it was a show of reverence did they give yes they gave they gave did they worship Wednesday night sure they worshiped did they give everything they could when the spirit was moving and asking for a fresh drink did they give everything or do they pretend to give everything I was thinking about that myself this week think about yourself go back to that service Wednesday night now this is a little bit different because I'm focusing on an actual specific service versus on your life but think about in those moments when the power of the Holy Spirit sweeps through this place and there's a cry coming out from God himself I just want your worship did you withhold anything or did you pour out every bit of worship you possibly could as I thought of that I wept because I was guilty I worshiped I gave a sacrifice I gave some but was there more I could have given did I give a pretense of reverence that I really do the part that was easy or was I willing to fight through all the hindrances that we heard about was I willing to fight through the Philistines for miles and miles and miles to get him a real drink or was it yes Lord I love you thank you Jesus did I withhold something did I pretend to give all did you give everything you had and so ananias and Sapphira have put on a show to have sacrificed as much as everybody else did we did just as much as Barnabas did we gave just as much and this is what we do many times at this church man people worship people really worship so I better worship too who everybody's on their feet I better stand up too I I'm sorry here we go soapbox that whole clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap to eventually that last person's like I better clap everybody else is clapping to me this is Aaron so just throw it away if you're like that's not worship that's clapping because everybody else is clapping you know I I never want to be that person that's stubborn and it's like I ain't standing up I don't care if everybody stood up I I don't want to be that person but I also don't want to be that person that's just doing stuff because everybody else is doing it because it's a show of worship be real be spontaneous don't hold anything back if you're going to worship worship give it your everything when the spirit moves be ready to do it be ready to worship worship because the spirit moves because he deserves to be worshiped praise him because he's almighty God praise him because he died for you praise him because he sent back the Holy Spirit praise him because he sent a message in this day we got a million reasons to praise him so just praise him with your whole heart give him everything that you got because he is God he deserves our worship he desires our worship just give it to him holy and when there's a love affair on the inside of you with God you don't have to force it you don't got to clap because everybody clap you don't got to stand up because everybody else stood up there's something on the inside of you ready to explode you're looking for a moment you're looking for an opportunity to say yes Lord thank you Jesus I love you Lord to stand to your feet and be identified with the weather worshiper identified with the word you're looking for that because there's a love affair on the inside of you because you've laid down yourself you've played down your ideas and it was a show of worship because of what Barnabas had done in chapter four oh so if I worship like this or I act like this or if I never miss service or if I sing with all my heart nobody's going to know that I'm lacking if I shout a little bit nobody's gonna think that I'm the one struggling no one's going to know that I really have great need of a change in my heart that I need more of God in my life there's a struggle going on between life and death it's real listen young people there's no shame in saying I need more there's no shame in saying I have fallen short there's no shame in the only real shame is continuing in a life live below your privileges do it due to being unable to admit I didn't give enough I didn't give all and so I'm going to continue this charade I'm going to continue pretending and living below my privileges and never overcoming and always falling short that's the shame there's no shame in coming to an altar young or old there's no shame in coming and saying Lord I need more of you I'm laying more of myself down tonight but we sit in service and the word speaks to our heart and you know you need more and the spirit moves and you know you should make your way to the altar Hey listen I believe in Rising above the altar but don't try to rise above the altar when you still got Junk in your life it ain't time to rise above the altar when you ain't settled it at the altar yet but you know you need to make your way to an altar don't be telling yourself that you don't need a place of repentance don't tell yourself that you don't need a place to die out as long as you've got things in your life that you haven't been able to get rid of yet you need to die out you need an altar you need to lay those things down maybe in church or youth service or Wednesday night or a Sunday an invitation is given and maybe maybe sometimes the minister just asked for a raising of hands maybe it's something that simple but in the presence of the Holy Ghost and in the presence of his people you say I'm okay and you pretend that you gave all I'm a message believer I'm a good kid I'm a Christian and you pretend you've given all you know this is just me and if it's wrong I'm sorry but I really believe in my heart all they had to do was come and say brother Peter we sold it for this much and we've got some real issues going right now and we need some of it I'm going to give you this half because it was an honest heart they were given an offering it was the pretending they were giving all just be honest with God God I know I'll follow him short I know I didn't give you everything I know that I'm not in the place I'm supposed to be and God respects an honest heart Peter I'm sorry that I can't give more right now this is all that I can give at the moment but they wanted to look like Barnabas they wanted people to think they were okay they wanted people to think they had the Holy Ghost they wanted to look like those that had given all that had surrendered everything and we get afraid of what is everybody else going to think if we admit it we get afraid of what other people are going to think if we struggle who cares what they think this is eternity we're talking about who cares what somebody thinks if they got a problem with you coming to the altar they need to be right there at the altar with you it's time to quit playing games it's time to quit pretending no amount of pretending is going to get you there no amount of pretending is going to make you miss out on tribulation brother Brown says would you raise up your hand and be honest say I've never been born again God bless you young lady That's mighty fine for you too God bless you back there sir another I'm just going to ask you so you be honest before God listen you must be you've got to be if you ever expect to make Heaven your home you must be honest with God make a stand for him come out and Show Your Colors don't be afraid do you want him do you really want him friend be sincere God bless you my brother no matter how long you've been professing if it's not in you why not be honest with God oh but what's people going to think I can't speak for around the world but I believe I can speak for evening like Tabernacle when you come to the altar they Rejoice with you that's what we think that's just them taking another step that's them wanting to draw closer to God that's them wanting to go into a Rapture that's our church being strengthened right there it's rejoicing it's Joy it's happiness I love to see you come to the altar well I came last service amazing you have the courage to come again how wonderful be honest with God who won't God be mad at me after all this time that I'm not where I need to be don't you think he knows the only people you may be fooling are people that don't matter in the grand scheme of things he's the only one who matters and guess what he knows he knows right where you're at tonight he knows right where you're sitting and all he desires is an honest heart let me show you an example of this in Mark 9 17 and one of the multitude answered and said master I have brought unto thee my son which hath the dumb spirit and wheresoever he taketh him he teareth him and he foameth and Nash with his teeth and pineth away and I spake to that disciples that they should cast him out and they could not and he answered him and said oh faithless generation how long shall I be with you how long shall I suffer you bring him unto me and they brought him unto him and when he saw him straightway the spirit tear him and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming and he asked his father how long is it a go since this came unto him and he said of a child and oftentimes it had cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him but if thou can't do anything have compassion on us and help us notice he tries to put it off on Jesus if you can do anything how many times do we do that Lord why can't you take this from me why can't you take this Spirit off my life I've asked and I've asked and I've asked and the spirit say why can't you take this Spirit why can't you deliver me from this lust why can't I be filled with the Holy Ghost God can't you do it and Jesus he doesn't get angry but he turns it right back around where it's supposed to be and Jesus said unto him if thou can'tst believe all things are possible to him that believeth and straightway the father of the child cried out and said with tears here's his altar moment Lord I believe in an honest heart help thou mine unbelief Lord I want to believe you but I'm not all the way there yet there's still some doubts lingering in My Heart Lord I do believe that our Christ I do believe that you can do but will you help my unbelief Lord I've tried I've come to the altar but but I hadn't given up everything I need to will you help me tonight Lord will you help me to quit pretending will you help me to surrender everything that's really on the inside of my heart it's an acknowledgment of his unbelief an acknowledgment that he just hasn't got there yet it's an honest heart I want to be Lord I believe Lord but I'm lacking something I admit it tonight Lord I don't have the Holy Ghost like I thought I did or maybe maybe I do and I'm just not achieving what you want me to be I'm not I'm not flying in the heavenlies like I'm supposed to be there's something holding me back lord I admit it tonight Lord won't you help me and in that moment the Lord meets his need because he finds an honest heart that's where we have to be at tonight young people as we begin to bring this down we must be willing to be humble enough in his presence to say I haven't given you everything there's more that I could give I know I can be more I know I can give more I know I can surrender more listen I don't know I don't want you to take this and run with it per se but you don't have to be perfect could be willing to admit you're not Lord I know I've fallen short Lord I know I haven't given it my hall Lord I know there's more Lord forgive me and help me to be what it is you want me to be instead of hiding it instead of pretending that you've given all be a pretender don't pretend you got it that's so hard for for many because they have a real experience they experience a move of God and they say I've got the Holy Ghost and they tell everybody which you should you should but then you have those moments of failure or something happens along the way and you realize maybe you didn't get what you thought you got and now there's a shame what do you think's gonna be harder to face you coming back saying I didn't have what I thought or facing him on that day going I knew but I was embarrassed there's no shame there's no condemnation being honest before God admitting it before God that's why Time After Time After Time We may seek deliverance and we fall short what time after time we fall into the same traps what time after time we can't find Freedom we want God to take things away from us and we pretend we want them gone but we won't lay them down and when you're really ready for something to be gone you'll lay it down brother Brown says so many says if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or from line or stealing I'll serve him but that's up to you see you got to do something too they that overcome shall inherit all things they that overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down see she has made herself ready I like that you see God could not push us through a little pipe pull us out on the other hand and then say blessed is he that overcometh you had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you've got to make decisions for yourself I have to make decisions for myself we show our faith and respects to God in doing that young people we live in a world full of pretend we live in a world where boys pretend they're girls and girls pretend they're boys they got so many letters for it now the lgbtq elemental p community and we live in a world that promotes pretend it promotes pretend you're something you're not it promotes pretend that you're this listen one day and I'm not trying to scare anybody I'm just being so I'm trying my best to be so real your pretend will be made manifest your pretend will be found out this the Rapture isn't something you can pretend and this isn't to de-christianize you that this is for you to answer the question in your heart tonight before God have I given all have I given all brother Brown says in you beat just what you are and if you're not a Christian don't say you are who if you're a sinner admit it God knows it and now your sinful condition just because you belong to church that won't help you one bit you might have a confession your name on the book living a righteous life you're still a sinner you've got to be born again not with a mental mind but by something that's happened in your heart see it's got to be friends don't never let the devil blindfold you to that it doesn't come by intellectual conception it comes by birth and your life copes right with that you must have it what are you saying tonight brother Aaron I'm saying if you don't got it admit it repent tonight and lay it all at his feet I'm not calling you bad not calling you a failure I'm not saying you ain't saved I'm saying don't pretend that you've laid it all down at his feet when there are things that you haven't given him don't expect Barnabas reward when you haven't done what Barnabas had to do don't blame your lack on him when you're the one who held back be honest with God I'm not asking you to be honest with me you're the best young people in the world I love each and every one of you you coming up here at the altar saying I've been wrong I've been in sin that doesn't change how we it's not about being honest with us it's about being honest with God who already knows he already knows where you're at be honest with yourself be willing to find an altar he says if you're here without Christ tonight if you haven't got a real genuine experience I want to ask you there's too many church members today there's too many people trying to pretend to be Christians if you're not really deeply in love in your heart with Christ there's no Christ there um we gotta be honest some things sometimes it's hard to be honest with ourselves but we got too many people that we've got rock and roll in their heart but they're pretending they got Hollywood in their heart but they're pretending they got lust in their heart but they're pretending there's lies in their heart but they're pretending listen young people no amount of church no amount of jumping and shouting no amount of Youth Services no amount of running around the building no amount of religious expression is going to get you in a Rapture the only thing that's going to get you into Rapture is the token the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you can't pretend your way to that it's got to be something real it's got to be a dying out you've got to lay yourself down and say Lord I give it all to you tonight I give you everything tonight you pretend so long and you pretend so long I hate to tell you on that day you won't be able to pretend that mama ain't there you won't be able to pretend that Daddy ain't there you won't be able to pretend that all your friends are gone it'll be a reality to you you won't be able to pretend that away lay it down tonight be honest tonight quit pretending you've given everything for there and you're trying this guy I'm not trying to scare you I'm trying to be honest with you tonight and say it's not too late the door's still open Mercy's still here Grace is still here laying it down at his feet tonight everything and we're not going to name names but every one of us know that we got friends and loved ones who we believe had real experiences with God who aren't sitting here real outpourings of the Holy Spirit upon their flesh you're upon their on their Spirit but they're not sitting here tonight they're not amongst us anymore what happened they didn't go all the way and they knew it but they weren't honest I'm telling you got to be honest because the feet of those that carried others out from your midst is at the door and it'll carry you out too if you're not real if you don't lay it all down if you're not honest before God the same spirits that carried them out will carry you out too oh I can play with this thing it'll carry you out too I can play with this thing you'll find yourself in a tribulation I don't have to lay this thing down at something little that little thing is going to keep you out of the rapture the feet is at the door to carry you out too but it's a moment of honesty There's an opportunity at repentance be real tonight and say I need to surrender more there's more for me to give tonight listen these brothers and sisters are here they're not here to judge you tonight they're here to pray for you they're here to support you they're here to lift you up it's okay to say God I'm not there yet God I need more of you tonight but there's real danger in pretending there is real danger in Time After Time coming into his presence and saying I've got it I've got everything I got need of Lord I gave you everything did you I'm right where I need to be are you brother Aaron are you trying to say I'm going to drop dead no but there is a judgment coming that no amount of pretending is going to get you out of no amount of pretending is going to help you to escape but tonight in his presence be willing to admit I need more I haven't laid it all down brother Brown says in one of these days when I come to the end of the road I didn't fix it up with the Lord a long time ago I said Lord I don't want no trouble when I come down there that morning if there's anything wrong in my life let me make it right right now for I won't have time when I come down to the river I don't want no trouble down there I'm gonna close you know at the very beginning I said I don't take these opportunities lightly y'all all know the story but we were just in Ohio youth service like this and I preached a sermon and at the end of that sermon a young girl come running to the altar I mean a lot a lot of people came to the altar but they tell me she was the first one there I'd been dealing with something heavy like this maybe people thought I was trying to scare people but I was telling them you're not promised tomorrow lay it down today get right with God today she was the first one at the altar and the last one to leave and days later her and her husband were gone their house just exploded and they were gone and and her parents reached out to me and said it's been such Comfort no one that she told us by all accounts like I said she was a Christian but she came and rededicated her life she said God I want to give you everything I can never take one of these Services lightly I can never take it for granted because every time we gather my mind goes what if it's somebody's last chance pretend don't pretend will you bow your heads with me I want to give you an opportunity right now to come to this Altar and just have a time of repentance time of prayer a time of laying it all down brother Brown says does any of the rest of you want to come the holy spirit's telling me there's several more people [Music] be honest with God won't you what you're going to lose to walk up here at the altar and pray a little he says you're going to pray somewhere if you don't pray here you're going to pray in hell [Music] the rich man lifted up his eyes now if you believe God's word and believe that I tell the truth if God's Vindicated it's true there's men and women in here that ought to be at this altar right now the Holy Spirit speaking saying so now with our heads bowed now check real close real real close and then be real real sincere that's all it takes you check your sincerity be real careful as you're checking now say search me Lord Try Me Lord is there any evil in me if there is Lord let me lay it down right here right now this place where I'm bowed is your altar I lay it down right here now and I put my feet upon it when I walk away it's going to still be laying here the power of your blood will consume it I want to be an overcomer I have something that's bothering me Lord and I want to overcome it and I can by you I've been told by your word that I lay it down now Lord I lay my feet upon it and as I pass out of this building this morning to know that it's been put in the tub of God's bleach it'll never be remembered no more I now confess it and I ask for mercy with our heads bowed and our eyes closed our hearts thinking as the door to the soul now is there something that you want to lay aside this morning something you want to overcome and you've tried it so hard but this morning you're going to quit trying you're just going to accept what he did that's once you raise your hand say Lord I want to overcome this thing that bothers me [Music] you've been honest before God you say Lord there's things I need to lay down there's more on me I need to surrender I've withheld certain parts of myself [Music] there's things I didn't want to give up there's things that I didn't want you to have but tonight Lord I'm opening every door Lord every little bit of entertainment every friendship every relationship every phone call every text message the way I treat my friends the way I treat the brothers and sisters in my youth group Lord I want to lay every bit of that down tonight I want to surrender all that I am to you Lord if you're seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's for you

me of a couple of years ago a youth camp brother Donnie Reagan spoke on the danger of an unsurrendered heart it's a good one to go back and listen to if you ain't heard it in a while just to make sure every part of your life is surrendered to him and to his will amen I'm gonna let you be seed unless Brother David turn on some music you don't have to be in no hurry to walk out just thinking about those that are on the road to Emmaus and he walked with them and talked with him he had your time around the altar maybe this will be a moment that you can just compel him to just stay for a little bit let me fellowship with you and talk with you once you invite him into your house for a moment just let him reveal his heart to you amen of course we have service two Services tomorrow amen and as you feel to go out your can be dismissed just go out as quietly as possible reverently as possible just take a few moments as long as you would like to just talk to the Lord personally for yourself and just say Lord I want to invite you personally into my life come into my house break the bread for me Amen in my life God bless you tonight [Music] foreign foreign foreign
