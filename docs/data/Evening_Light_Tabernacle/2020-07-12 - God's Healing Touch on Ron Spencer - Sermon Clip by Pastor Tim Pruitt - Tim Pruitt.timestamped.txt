[0:01] just wanted to tell you a little bit
[0:03] before we go into the message this
[0:06] morning
[0:07] what we've been through in the last
[0:08] couple of weeks as you know the last two
[0:10] sundays i
[0:12] i have not been in the pulpit we um
[0:15] we have of course had some situations in
[0:19] at home where my wife had a complete a
[0:22] tremendous brain bleed there and was
[0:25] sent to
[0:27] the hospital into lsu where they did
[0:29] surgery on her
[0:31] um you may not know and i understand the
[0:35] severity of where we were
[0:37] but um the doctors gave us very grim
[0:39] news said that
[0:41] you know she could live five minutes or
[0:43] five years but
[0:44] she would not have any quality of life
[0:46] if she did
[0:47] and they came out and and told me just
[0:50] to prepare for death
[0:52] that that's how severe that it was even
[0:55] when i got the call from lsu
[0:57] i knew by the way that they um asked me
[1:00] about the surgery that they wasn't given
[1:03] much hope for her recovery and
[1:07] as you know today we're we're here on
[1:10] the other side of that and we can
[1:12] rejoice
[1:12] because there's no loss of limb no loss
[1:15] of memory
[1:16] that means she's complete
[1:22] amen we thank god for that
[1:25] and god has answered prayer
[1:28] just to kind of go back over some of
[1:30] these things just for a moment
[1:33] week before last you know brother ron
[1:36] spencer was here
[1:37] he was kind of a surprise visit um
[1:41] most of you didn't know about it because
[1:43] we kept it secret brother ron
[1:45] spencer is a pastor friend of ours from
[1:48] over in virginia and um he is a
[1:51] muslim friend of of mine and and
[1:54] someone that i love very much and
[1:58] he has had um stage
[2:02] four melanoma cancer
[2:05] it spread from his lungs and jumped into
[2:08] his brain
[2:09] just right after that he got it he had a
[2:12] first aid clear
[2:13] brain scan and then you know uh
[2:17] and i just thankful well it's not in his
[2:19] brain it's just in his lungs well
[2:21] he jumped right immediately into the
[2:23] lungs
[2:24] from the lungs into the brain but um
[2:28] you know he has steadfastly believed and
[2:30] we've been praying and believing with
[2:32] him
[2:33] and by the way brother timothy caught
[2:34] the wind of the spirit this morning
[2:37] as we as as i just had it on the tip of
[2:40] my tongue
[2:41] to tell you don't go and pray for your
[2:43] mom don't go and pray for brother ron
[2:45] you go and thank god for their healing
[2:48] that's what i want you to do i want you
[2:50] to thank god
[2:51] it's already done amen we're confessing
[2:54] it and we're believing it
[2:56] but he had preached at his own home
[2:58] church um
[3:00] just um a bit prior to him coming
[3:03] the weekend before he was coming i must
[3:05] get to jesus
[3:07] and in reference to the queen of the
[3:10] south
[3:10] uh who came to hear the wisdom of
[3:13] solomon
[3:14] he noted that you know that people would
[3:18] would drive 17 18 hours to get
[3:21] into brother branham's meetings to get
[3:23] in the presence of jesus and
[3:25] would be healed and it struck him
[3:27] afterwards that he must do the same
[3:30] and so he wanted to drive over here to
[3:32] louisiana
[3:33] and spend some time with me and for me
[3:36] to pray for him
[3:37] now of course you know i'm not a healer
[3:40] the lord is a healer but
[3:42] um it's there's gifts in the body and
[3:45] gifts of healing is one
[3:47] let me explain it like this uh just
[3:49] sharing this from
[3:51] looking under jesus and said you know
[3:52] what the gift of healing
[3:54] is faith in healing you just release
[3:57] your faith to pray for somebody
[3:59] that's all the gift of healing is every
[4:01] minister should have it
[4:02] everybody you see should have a gift of
[4:05] healing the power
[4:06] that heals you is on the inside of you
[4:09] the holy spirit
[4:10] you just have to let it work its way out
[4:13] so brother ron wanted to come and
[4:15] and we were excited about him coming i
[4:17] started praying
[4:19] and fasting in the preparation for his
[4:22] coming here
[4:23] he was going to leave um his after
[4:26] church on
[4:26] sunday and drive here and would arrive
[4:29] on monday
[4:30] which he did but after making the
[4:33] decision to come
[4:34] he told his family now you just watch
[4:38] the devil try to stop this and
[4:42] and of course he did but the devil don't
[4:45] have enough
[4:48] amen my wife karen was excited about him
[4:51] coming
[4:52] she was gonna make his favorite german
[4:54] chocolate cake and
[4:56] went shopping on thursday to get all the
[4:58] supplies for
[4:59] his arrival and and um and then
[5:02] that night at about 11 p.m she woke me
[5:06] up by going to the
[5:07] bathroom turning on the light and i
[5:09] asked her if she was okay
[5:11] and she said i've got a terrible
[5:13] headache and she mentioned she was going
[5:15] into another room and
[5:17] and take her blood pressure and i
[5:20] followed her in there
[5:22] and found her with her head on the table
[5:24] groaning
[5:25] and um i said we we've got to go to the
[5:29] hospital now
[5:30] and she said she protested no i don't
[5:33] want to go i don't need to go
[5:35] i just threw a robe around her and made
[5:37] her get in the car
[5:38] and we were you know on her way she was
[5:40] just groaning and
[5:41] moaning and there would be moments that
[5:43] i was
[5:44] thought she had passed out and she
[5:46] became nauseated throwing up
[5:49] and uh i was going to drive all the way
[5:51] to shreveport because that's where the
[5:53] neuro
[5:54] unit is in the trauma unit in freeport
[5:57] at the lsu
[5:58] ostrich and the doctors but i
[6:01] i couldn't make it that far because of
[6:03] her throwing up and the pain level
[6:05] and so i whipped into menden medical
[6:08] center and
[6:09] there they um intubated her and she
[6:13] was totally unconscious doctor's report
[6:16] from the scams was she wasn't going to
[6:18] make it
[6:19] yeah she had a huge brain bleed it was
[6:21] pushing the right side of her brain
[6:23] out of position and the damage would
[6:26] cause her
[6:27] to die and if she lived the doctor said
[6:30] she would
[6:31] only be a vegetable well friday morning
[6:35] sister karen had emergency brain surgery
[6:38] where they relieved the pressure they
[6:40] cauterized the vessels
[6:42] and you know i
[6:45] as i was just praying and assessing the
[6:48] situation
[6:49] i just began to realize that she was
[6:51] there in the nicu
[6:53] that and and i stood beside her there
[6:57] immediately i watched her when she was
[6:59] wheeled out of surgery and
[7:01] stood there by our bedside on friday and
[7:04] saturday morning i was there again and
[7:06] as i was praying there i just said you
[7:08] know
[7:09] i'm not going to let this stop brother
[7:11] ron from coming
[7:13] and so i made arrangements for him for
[7:15] my daughters to
[7:17] um to go to the icu room since their
[7:20] mother was
[7:21] really you know out of it didn't didn't
[7:24] know
[7:25] really what was going on and so i made
[7:28] arrangements for them to go and
[7:30] i called brother ron and i said um i i
[7:33] you come on
[7:34] i said we'll meet over at our camp there
[7:36] at haven's rest and
[7:38] and uh so he he
[7:41] he came they left right after church on
[7:44] sunday he ministered they drove
[7:46] all the way to birmingham from
[7:48] birmingham they came
[7:50] here to louisiana monday night we had a
[7:53] prayer meeting together
[7:55] and i guarantee you when you're in a
[7:56] moment like this you just don't just say
[7:58] god bless so-and-so and so
[8:00] it's a moment of desperation and
[8:04] you know it was a great time in the
[8:07] presence of the lord but i just felt
[8:08] like there was
[8:09] more and i knew i would have another
[8:12] opportunity and tuesday evening
[8:14] we spent the evening speaking of the
[8:16] exploits of faith
[8:18] and creating as i tried to
[8:22] channel the conversation because i
[8:24] wanted to generate a
[8:26] an atmosphere of faith and we just began
[8:29] to talk about
[8:30] exploits of faith and different
[8:32] testimonies of god's healing power
[8:35] and i i began to feel the atmosphere get
[8:38] more and more
[8:39] charged and uh brother aaron
[8:42] and and of course brother timothy
[8:44] brother michael dexter
[8:45] was there and and brother aaron was
[8:48] about to leave and i said don't leave i
[8:49] said
[8:50] you know i want we want to pray we want
[8:53] to have another time of prayer
[8:55] and this time there was a breakthrough
[8:57] to the anointing
[8:59] and then the then as as we seen the holy
[9:03] spirit just come
[9:04] down it was just things that was you
[9:07] know had been on brother
[9:08] ron's heart he had desired to come back
[9:11] to louisiana again
[9:13] the devil told him he would never be
[9:14] here again and then he wanted to be in a
[9:17] prayer line with me again
[9:18] and the devil told him you'll never have
[9:20] another prayer line with brother tim
[9:22] but right there in that in that camp we
[9:24] had a prayer line and prayed for
[9:26] luke and andrew and adam frazier
[9:29] connie's nephew and
[9:31] god just moved upon them in a tremendous
[9:33] way
[9:34] filling them with the holy spirit of god
[9:36] and and um
[9:38] you know what a presence that was and we
[9:41] saw the holy spirit
[9:42] move and then wednesday night we come to
[9:45] church and brother ron and i
[9:47] spent time together in my office where
[9:50] as you know
[9:51] the testif he testified of seeing the
[9:53] angel of god and together
[9:55] we prayed again right in that very same
[9:57] spot
[9:58] and since that time god has given
[10:00] brother ron some amazing strength
[10:03] and he has preached with such anointing
[10:06] such anointing and
[10:08] such power since that time and
[10:11] i checked upon him as he arrived home
[10:14] leaving wednesday night
[10:15] and let me just stop here for a moment
[10:17] because that wednesday night service
[10:19] went right on over to
[10:20] brother timothy's house and followed
[10:22] them into the house
[10:24] that anointing and the holy spirit fell
[10:26] upon his children
[10:27] the girls there adriana and katie and
[10:30] god did some amazing things in their
[10:33] life and
[10:34] adriana was testifying to me that she
[10:36] got what she needed
[10:37] to be able to testify i have the holy
[10:40] spirit in my life
[10:42] what a wonderful thing god's moving
[10:45] amen what he did he'll for them he'll do
[10:48] for you
[10:50] amen but um brother ron of course the
[10:54] next day
[10:55] uh getting home on thursday i called him
[10:58] to check on him
[10:59] he's already gone down on three hours to
[11:01] see his dad and has to come three two
[11:03] hours back and
[11:04] the next day he's gone again doing a
[11:08] route with
[11:08] with his son and and different things
[11:10] and he ain't stopped
[11:13] and today today in his home church he's
[11:17] preaching a convention meeting where the
[11:19] service is going to be sent to brother
[11:21] harold hildebrand and brother
[11:22] brother hammermeister there in edmonton
[11:25] where they're going to be playing it in
[11:26] their convention
[11:28] so he's already back to preaching
[11:30] conventions again
[11:38] hallelujah my god is unstoppable
[11:44] his people are unstoppable and the devil
[11:47] don't have enough
[11:50] but god is more than enough
[11:53] i said he's more than enough
[11:56] you'll meet your need this morning
[11:58] whatever it is because this
[12:00] god is thou shalt i and he's more than
[12:03] enough to meet your need
[12:06] to fill you with his spirit to give you
[12:08] a repression from his presence
[12:11] to give you another feeling of the holy
[12:13] ghost to take out the lukewarmness
[12:15] and put in there the power of the living
[12:17] god the power of his resurrection
[12:22] hallelujah hallelujah that's a general
[12:26] standing there brother ron spencer
