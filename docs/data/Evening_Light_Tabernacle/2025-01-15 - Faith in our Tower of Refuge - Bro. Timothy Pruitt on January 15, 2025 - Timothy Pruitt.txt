the Lorden amen Proverbs 18 and verse 10 says the name of the Lord is a strong tower and the righteous runthe amen just read it again the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run into it and is safe amen God bless you and be seated actually was looking at some other things um I guess this is one my my first time preaching this year and I was looking for some at some other things but just this week I believe it was Sunday night or Monday night can't remember now but I had a dream and most of it I don't remember but I remember being in a a block building of some sort or a stone like just you could see things lapping upon another like blocks or stones and I was there with brother Tim brother Ron Brother Kelly just some some faces that stood out my wife Ruth and there were some others there many of you and out of nowhere a storm hit us and it was very high winds it was terrifying and the building was shaking and and things were happening you could hear screams all around but that building was not moved I mean it was it was shaking in the cist but it it did not move it off its foundation it was terrible outside but you know we came through that storm unharmed and I remember as I was waking up remarking as we were talking and different ones gathered around and admiring this building how it was the roof was attached and I remember seeing Nails nailed in certain places and and and and things put in a certain way and we were marveling how bad the storm was but how well this building did and how we were protected and we were okay and I got to thinking about that has been on my heart this week as I I know a lot of folks are in storms of life we're all in one great storm called Leo DEA uh it's the Winds of hell that are blowing around and you know in the storm is not getting any less but it's getting greater uh the storms of sin are pushing harder the storms of sicknesses are coming harder but I'm thankful that we have a place of refuge and it's not just a place place that we can we have to worry about with this hold or with this this be able to stand the storm but it is proven throughout history that it can stand the storms of life and it's a strong tower it is the greatest defense that we have to fight against Satan is the name of the Lord amen and we know the name of the Lord is Jesus Christ and there's no name that is higher there's no name that is greater there's no name that is more powerful than the name of Jesus Amen and the scripture here is describing the name that name as a strong tower other translations for strong tower are a place of protection a a a fortified Tower a strong Fortress a tower of strength it means actually to be set safely and securely on high in other words too high to be captured or in other words too strong to be accessible by the enemy it's a place that is elevated above the trouble now you say how can that be we're in a time of trouble sure but it's a place though we're in trouble and it may be all around you it cannot grab you and take you down Amen in other words it's around you that that that trouble that's around you may scream it may holler it may make threats but it cannot capture you because you're in a place of safety and what what we need for our Victory is inside of that tower inside of that Tower is every word we need for healing for deliverance for salvation inside of that Tower the name of Jesus Christ is everything that we have need of between here and the Rapture I believe in that Tower there's enough there's enough power Amen in that Tower to set every sinner free to heal every sick person Amen to bring back every person that's backsliding in a way from God I believe there's enough power in that name amen there may be other names that have been been powerful upon the Earth amen names of kings and names of conquerors but there's no greater name than the name of Jesus at the very mention of that name every demon trembles every demon backs up because it he knows the power that is represented in that name and I I was looking at the different scriptures as we go through this and I was looking at a scripture in Judges chapter 9 and verse 50 it was a king that came against the city and he began to begin to go encamp about it and he took it but inside of this city in verse 51 was there was a strong tower in the city thither fled all the men and women and all they that were of the city and shut it shut it to them and got them up to the top of the tower and a bimc came into the tower now I I was doing a lot of study on this actually and me in almost every city in that in that culture there was always a strong tower to run up into to amen so they would run up into this place because they knew if they could get up in there so high place is a strong place and the enemy cannot just easily come up to where you're at without you being a defendant so here aimc comes against the tower and he comes against and he fights against it and he comes hard to the door and he's trying to burn it with fire but inside of that Tower was something for their Deliverance inside of that Tower amen was a a stone that was there and this woman actually grabs his Stone and comes up to the window and she looks over the tower and there's aimc coming against the door and she just gets this Stone and she just drops it down and it lands upon his head and it crushes him down and he says to his sword Bearer he says please will you just stab me cuz I don't want to be told about me that I was killed by a woman and I thought about that you know as as we're pushed into this Tower or we run into this Tower amen as the Bible says a bright just run in and are safe and we get inside of this Tower I want you to understand when you're inside this Tower you're not helpless when you're inside this Tower there's something there already provided for your Victory if you can see it and you can grab a hold of it and you can just place it upon your hands and you can look out the window as it were and drop it upon your enemy maybe it's a word of of of God that has been ministered to you over this pull pit or or a word that has been given to you in this Bible there's power that is there to defeat your enemy amen and so as we look at this thought Amen in in Psalms chapter 20 and verse one the Lord hear thee in the day of trouble and the name of God of Jacob defend thee now if you look at that word defend thee you wouldn't think of it as being a tower but this actually this word defend the how they used it it actually means to be raised or to be exalted to be put higher to defend it refers to the physical size indicating great height City walls in a figurative sense it indicates a high impregnable City or habitation so God has put you in a place in his habitation in his word where the enemy can come against it but they will not Prevail they can come against it but it will stand they can come against it but it will not fall to the ground sir amen amen hallelujah Psalm 61 says the end of the Earth will I cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I for thou H has been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy and I will abide in thy Tabernacle forever I will trust in the covert of thy Wings saah Psalm 18 and verse 2 says the Lord is my rock and my Fortress and my deliverer my God my strength in whom my trust my Buckler and the Horn of my salvation and my high tower almost every one of these you look at it describes it not just as a to Tower but as a high tower as a place of elevation that the enemy cannot get to you we can read in Psalms 91 and I I know personally this brother Ron Spencer's favorite scripture Psalms 91 and verse one he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high I shall abide under the shadow of the almighty and I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God in him will I trust amen I I I guess the Lord wanted y'all to hear this because he gave it to you in the song now he's given to you in scripture right I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God in him will I trust surely he will deliver thee From The Snare of the Fowler and from the noise of pest he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor the arrow that fth by day nor the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor the destruction that waits to that noon day a thousand may fall at thy side and 10,000 at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee Only With Thine Eyes shall thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou Hast made the Lord Which is my Refuge even the most high thy habitation amen there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come now thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways and they shall bear thee up in their hands lest they thou Dash thy foot against a stone Thou shalt tread upon the lion and the adder and the Young Lion and dragon shalt th trample under feet because he has set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him notice that changes from from David speaking to God speaking because he set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him and I will set him on high and I will set him on high because he has know my name amen because he has known my name who I am what's in my name the power that's there amen the victory that's there the the peace that's there therefore since he knows who I am I will set him in the place of safety he shall call upon me and I will answer him I will be with him in trouble and I will deliver him and honor him with long life will I satisfy him and show him my salvation I don't know about you but I believe eternal life is long life you can live 90 years old 95 100 years that's not very long in the grand scheme of things amen but eternal life that's long life amen you know and so we look at it in 1 Corinthians 10 now you say well brother Timothy I'm going through a lot of things I got a lot of Trials I got a lot of things things are going on in my family situation 1 Corinthians 10:13 says there is no temptation taking you but such as common to man in other words you're not dealing with things nobody else has ever dealt with and the same God that was faithful for them is the same God that's going to be faith faithful for you amen but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that's right you hear that above that which you're able in other words he's not going to allow the temptation to get above you he's not going to allow it to get over you and rule over you and rule over your life and it's everything that it just dictates everything you do the Temptation doesn't and the trial does and the devil over your life he's not going to allow it to get above you but as the Temptation gets higher he's going to lift you higher as the Temptation gets greater he's going to lift you up greater come on somebody amen God is not going to allow you to be bent over to Satan's Temptation and Satan's trial and be subject to it he's already set you free that's right therefore he's not going to allow you to come under his subjection any longer amen he may try to put sickness on it but he's not going to allow that sickness to rule you that's right amen he may put trials upon you but he's not going to let those trials rule you but he's going to lift you up above them that's right she's not going to let suffer you be tempted above that you are able God always makes a way of Escape always look to the Bible it's always though Satan May pin you in a corner he says with cancer God Will Make A Way of Escape amen well I mean maybe you ain't never dealt with cancer but those who have maybe you can say Amen pretty good at that cuz he made a made a way of Escape Satan May pin you under a car God Will Make A Way of Escape Satan may have taken your family away from you but God Will Make A Way of Escape God always has a way God is never out of ideas that's he's never having to come up with new ideas amen he's never he's never worried about a situation he knows exactly how it's going to work out and it's going to work out for your good you know Moses and Israel was in the line of duty one time and they came right up in in the pillar of Fire was leading them here they were the prophet was with them the pillar of fire was leading them and it led them right down into a trap he said he said see God likes to get his people in a trap to see what they'll do yeah Hallelujah anyhow God likes to get his people in a trap to see what they'll do every Su they come of the God must be tried he gets them there he brings you here he puts you in between a pin opions amen he brings you here he puts you in between opinions well that could just be this that could just be he put you in a trap to see what kind of decision you're going to make right see that's right search the scriptures God let it get that way he brought Israel right down into a trap mountains and deserts on both sides Pharaoh's Army behind and the Red Sea right in front of them that's they were trapped on all sides it look like God was a terrible military General he left his people with no retreat you see that's a that's a that's a thought many times in military you always got to look for a way out if the Fire gets too bad if the fight gets too rough you're looking for a what well can I can I move this way and can I back out this way you're always looking for that but sometimes God allows it he lets the doctor walk away and say just said to you you can't live you're going to die the cancer is going toat eat you up you'll never get out of that chair he seems to leave you with no retreat because why you know why because he is your [Applause] retreat Hallelujah medical science is not our Retreat we thank God for medical science and what God's allowed men to learn but that's not what we depend on our depending is upon the word of almighty God he said by my stripes is I'm he so therefore I can I can depend on what he said I can Retreat into that word and be lifted up in the word of God above my enemy he is your retreat you climb into his arms oh God I wish I could I wish I could get the feeling I had in that dream to you tonight to know that while all that storm was going on I knew we were safe didn't matter how bad it was going to get I'm safe it could kept it just kept getting worse and worse and worse but I was safe that's a lot of Peace in that ain't it amen you live in a home and you can live in a brick home and a tornado's headed your way you don't feel safe get make it even worse getting in a trailer house or something else hey you don't feel safe but to be in a place place that no matter how bad it's going to get I'm safe it just takes a worry out of your heart that no matter how this is going to be I'm safe no matter how this situation is going to work out I am safe cuz I am in his name I I have come into I've been buried in his name I have risen in his name I have accepted his name into my life so it doesn't doesn't matter what's going on around me God is my refuge he's the mighty tower the name of the Lord is a mighty tower the righteous run into and are saved the tower is a refuge he is our refuge there's no other Refuge I want to have but him listen this world is trying to find Refuge right now that's right all over the place they're trying they're looking they're looking for a savior the United States is looking for a savior they're looking for a refuge and a place of safety they want to know is is my family safe is my money safe is my house safe is is things around is safe you know we we got different degrees of how how we judge things that you know just hearing about those terrible FL fires in California and most of the folks are like well least I know I I have my family I had a lot of stuff you lot a lot of the rich people say they're just a bunch of stuff did did you hear me rich people they got all kinds of things but now they're saying it ain't nothing but a bunch of stuff they worked all their life to get it great big uh uh expensive arts and and things they had collected and all this stuff burn up in the fire now it's just stuff at least I have my family but then what's going to happen as the as it gets worse and things begin to go worse and it turns from just a natural fire into a nuclear fire and they begin to scream about their family and the loss that they've gone through listen this is coming upon the Earth it is coming upon the Earth there's no place safe in this world Earth you can dig a hole as deep as you want to get it you can pour as much concrete as you want to pour you'll never be safe from the Judgment that's coming upon this Earth unless you run into the name of Jesus Christ brand said I remember the first time I ever spoke in tongues I was preaching at miltown Baptist Church he said I got all wound up you know Baptist sitting there looking at me and Holy Ghost came down on on me and I jumped out in the middle of the aisle and I began to speak in tongues and I thought well what is happening to me I never knew anything about it when I started back I heard my lips say this I'm a rock in a weary land a refuge in the time of storm oh how I wondered everyone look look at at one another like geese in a yard looking at each other looking like that and I felt the same way because I didn't know but something had happened to me I had found the [Music] tower come on somebody it makes a difference when you have found the tower when you have found the place of safety you tried to find it you tried to find it in drugs or alcohol or whatever else Amen to try to appease your life and to make peace with your enemies but all of a sudden one day I found the tower and I realized when I got inside of that the devil couldn't get to me no more hallelujah amen that spot is a blessed hiding place if you ever come to Christ if God it's God's provided place of safety the name of the where he said the name of the Lord is a mighty tower the righteous run into and are safe in the time of sicknesses when stri when sickness strikes the doctor says there's nothing else I can do about it you don't got to build up a lot of pressure just let off the pressure yeah let off the pressure a lot of pressure in these days we're living in ain't it pressures of all kinds coming from every direction it's what happens when a storm comes the pressure changes if I if I remember correctly they used to talk about in school when I was in school he said if a tornado was to come you're supposed to let up the windows a little bit fire if it was a fire you close the windows and why it's because of the pressures and they're trying to allow for those pressures because when a tornado comes it changes the pressure of a building to where actually it can just explode it looks like it just blows apart why because of the pressure and this is what we're seeing people do in this day they're they're exploding because of the pressure they tried on their own they tried by their own achievements they tried by their own knowledge and and they listen it doesn't matter how much money you got you can still commit suicide it doesn't matter how good you got it you can still give yourself to every devil in hell amen why because of the pressures and Satan has designed this world to be full of pressure yes and the storm comes it seems like the pressure pressure is about to just blow you up wonder how am I going to stand this tell you how you going to do it he's going to just lift you up a little higher when you're in this Refuge you got a right to anything that's in the Refuge direct quote when you're in this Refuge you got a right to anything that's in the Refuge Christ is our refuge and everything you have need of is in him amen it's it's sickness don't build up pressure let off pressure what do you mean let off pressure quit worrying about it people can get a little stomach virus get so tore up because why the devil's got it in their mind that they got something worse or they going to have this problem they going to have just let off the pressure so he's the Lord God that heals all my diseases by his stripes I'm Healed and just walk on Amen see see you say well I'm so worried what you worried about he said while you're in this Refuge you got a right to everything that's in Refuge so what you worried about well I wonder I worry you don't have to wonder you don't have to worry commit your case to God and go on as if it's already over with amen see well I'm so worried in the City of Refuge he took your worry so you don't have to worry about it Hallelujah so you just cast your cares upon Him for he careth for you don't worry about your cares that's his business listen if he said not a little Sparrow could fall to the ground without my heavenly father knowing about it not one there's Millions not one can fall to the ground and he not know about it think about that just for a minute just for a minute not one can f fall to the ground and he not know about it so how much more you than a little bitty bird as we heard we was the Capstone of his creation he's not thinking about birds more than he's thinking about you you are the Capstone of his creation he created the birds for you not you for the birds but the birds for you amen he created it so so so so what he showing you that if I can see this little bird fall to the ground don't you know I know when you're sick don't you know I know about it when somebody in your family walks away or this happen or that goes right don't you know I know about your everyday Affairs I know about your situation and I care for you and I love you and I will not let it fall to the ground and it not get my attention he's a City of Refuge but R said now listen to this brother R said I met a woman in a 10 cent store one day she was about 60 years old and she looked about 30 pretty good pretty good jeans Ain it yeah I said well how did you do it sister she said well brother brandom I got two sons that are doctors that's older than you are honest to goodness she didn't look over 30 years old and when I she said when I come to Christ I was about 12 years old and I sat down and thought about it and I studied religions but when I found the true one and I come to Christ and I took my case my soul my all to him and I've never had a worry sense Hallelujah said why cuz he promised he would take care of me that's right he promised he would take care of all my troubles and if he's not big enough to do it I know I'm not big enough amen so once you some worrying about it anyhow God promised he would take care of you so cast your cares on him what are you worried about if you keep worrying about it you're going to blow up cuz it builds pressure I just had to ask this dumb question has anybody ever felt relaxed while worrying just chill worrying no no start ringing your hands Sweating Bullets Crossing Bridges all kind of stuff happening you ain't chill you ain't relaxed no you're Fring you're tore up your stomach starts getting tore up and T tied up in knots come on oh my quit worrying well that's easier said than done well maybe so but quit worrying turn to your neighbor right now and just tell them quit worrying God's got it we can name every trouble everyone's facing in here tonight God's got it we can name every sickness in here that everyone in this building or online is facing tonight God's got it we can face every heart trouble every disease every Temptation every situation every devil in hell God's got it God's got the answer for your situation before you even get to it that's right and so why ises it help when you get to it to start worrying about it if he's already got it figured out before you get there and he's already made a way of EXC it might not look like a way but God has a way it might look like a Red Sea but God has a word that'll split the Red Sea and you'll walk across on dry land shouting the victories of God why cuz God's got it Hallelujah makes me want to shout to know God's got it he's got my family he's got my body he's got my mind he's got the church He's got everybody he's got got every young person he's got every family He's got everybody God's got [Applause] it you said how do I do that just trust in your Refuge now if you're outside of the Refuge I don't blame you for worrying I don't BL blame you for sweating bullets I don't blame me for getting all tore up and anxiety all over you but if you're in the Refuge what's the use in worrying devil can't come up to where you're at we're seated together in Heavenly places how do I do it just trust his promise he made the promise even in the time of death when the death Angel's coming through well you so I I'll be nervous Oh no you're in a refuge you're not maybe you're going to die and you you got to go some way but just you're in the Refuge so feel safe that's right you're safe as long as you're in the Refuge CU God cares about you you say well you mean when the death Angel's knocking at the door I don't have to get all steamed up about it no not a bit well wait a minute let's take Israel for a moment when they were down in Egypt and the Death Angel started coming through but they they were in a place of Refuge if they done what the word said they could be in a house and still the death angel could enter but if they had done what the word said and took his faith and dipped it in the blood and put it over their door then their house became a place of Refuge it came a place that the death angel could not enter in amen and so when death was coming to the door and maybe this little boy looking out the window he could see that dark SP Dark Angel and says daddy do you love me sure son I love you Daddy I I I'm your firstborn I I'm you are son that's right look here Daddy the Angels got that little boy I knew him down the street I played with him and he's coming he's coming toward the house daddy you you what but son do you see that doorpost Daddy will he give me no he can't get you that's right why can't he because I have done what the prophet said I have applied it as he said when I see the blood I'll pass over you amen go back and get your toys and just start Play Israel was relaxed hello Israel was relaxed what some of y'all look at me like a mule looking at a new gate relaxed you must not be what I'm dealing with no and you're not dealing with what I'm dealing with so there yes but we can be relaxed not relaxed in a sense that we put our armor down and we don't fight no we can rest in his promises that's we can rest in the assurance that The God Who made the way through through the through the to the promised land is the same one that's going to take a group into this Promised Land he's the same God Amen so death can come to your door as long as God's requirement the blood's been placed on the lentil h post of your heart what difference does it make can't bother me if the doctor says you're going to die tomorrow what difference does it make the blood is on the post you got to die sometimes anyhow but if that blood's been applied I have a Resurrection coming amen that's right Israel could be calm they didn't have to build up a lot of steam for they know that the death angel could not strike them behind the blood all that is in Jesus is safe that's hello now if you're in a if you're in a movement whether it be a Pentecostal movement or a Baptist movement or a message movement that's why you're not safe but if you're in Jesus the word the message of this hour and you've allowed his life to come inside of you you are safe that's it there ain't nothing the devil could ever do to destroy you well you say well he could kill me so so what you have a body that is awaiting you listen we got to get to the point that we really believe that's what's over there is over there come on we got to get to there we got to believe that that land is more real than this land it's got to become more reality that land has to be more of a reality than this land he said I brand said one time over in the orient I was riding in a jeep with a minister friend and uh there was somebody there tended some sheep I said out there with sheeps and donkeys and different things I said well what do you call that fell he said a Shepherd I said well I thought a Shepherd just hurted sheep he said oh no Shepherd hurt sheeps goats cattle donkeys camels whatever more I said well I didn't know that he said here's something I want you to know brother brand when the Sun starts setting the she goes out amongst all the animals and he hunts until he finds the last sheep and he brings them into the Corral and he puts them in the Corral at night but the rest of them stay outside though he herds all of them and I thought come to me oh God let let me not be as a donkey let me be a sheep that when my flame is diming and the son of my life is setting take me safely to the crowd when my eyes are closed and I don't want to be left out there and just so be a so-called Christian I want to be a real sheep amen amen because listen a place a place of Refuge is only for those who will accept it that's there's many that heard about a place of Refuge amen Noah how long did he preach 120 years of an ark a place of Refuge but how many rejected it right well I build my own boat what do you know about boat building you ain't never built a boat no I build my own it wasn't the time to build your own boat it was the time to get on the ark that was a place of safety amen this is what he's saying amen there's many out there there's many in every Church brother brand preached three kinds of Believers much as we want to believe that all are believers amen there's three kinds of Believers come on True Believers made Believers and unbelievers amen sheeps donkeys camels yes I hate that I said you was looking at me like a mule looking at a new gate I don't want you to be a mule I want you to be a sheep but I can't make you a sheep brother Tim can't make you a sheep none of us can make you a sheep only God can give you that nature change amen so you know he said but they out on they said they EA in the same pasture other words they come to the same church the rain falls on the just and the unjust people sit together crowds of people some of them are some of them are not they all fall they all fall on The Same Spirit The Same Spirit blesses the same crowd if the rain will fall on a conck bur and it'll straighten up rejoice and that same rain will fall on a we and it'll bring forth rejoicing out of their lives Christians bear Christians lives he said but God's safety is on God's place of safety when we're in here in this Refuge we have a right to the healing power of God if God will forgive his enemy and take him into a refuge how much more will he take care of him and after he got him in there there is healing power so when Christians get sick there's no need of being all steamed up about it remember this by his stripes I'm Healed it's a promise and it's in my refuge amen it's a place of Refuge for our sicknesses for our worries and we can cast our cares upon Him it's a refuge We Trust in his word his promises every promise that he made belongs to you you as long as you're in the Refuge as long as you come to him for refuge and you have the right to every promise that he made every Christian in here or anywhere else has a right to everything that Christ died for and when you're in Christ you possess the whole thing it's all yours that's right Hallelujah his name is a tower it's a great Refuge is a tower that we can come in to give us assurance that if I ask anything if I ask the father anything in this great name of of the tower this great name Jesus it'll be given to you watch it come into it be born into it then ask the father anything you want to be in that name and watch him honor his name watch him honor his name Isaiah described him as a rock in a weary land this land that we're in is a weary land it's a tiresome land amen we're living in a weary time when people are trying to dig holes under their houses amen for Escape Routes and Escape Routes and the ability to live and stood instead of trying to come to the true Refuge the true place where they can be safe don't you know a nuclear bomb is going to fall and it's going to blast every one of them bunkers to Smither Rines it'll break every bone in those bunkers why some of them bombs will blow a hole 1502 200t deep now this is this is back in the 60s when he's speaking this now what do we got today and I get I just have to laugh at people who think they hiding stuff they hiding from the government you ain't hiding from nothing you're not neither are you hiding from God well I I just my refuge is my family I no your Refuge needs to be God that's where your Refuge has to be my refuge is my job no your Refuge needs to be God your Refuge needs to be a place that has never failed right because we're going through unprecedented times yeah I don't look for the storm storm winds to get less well I'm so glad we made it through 2020 so glad we made it through 20 and it just gets worse and it gets worse and it gets worse and the world gets worse that's what the world's going towards worse and worse and worse is not going to get better right if it goes 100 years it's not going to get better it's going to get worse so there's only one place of safety There's No Escape there's no getting away from it there's there's only one escape and that's Jesus Christ there's only one place of safety and that's Jesus Christ it'll hold it's held through every time in the Scriptures it held held held held held all the way through and it's getting worse but it's still holding it's getting worse but it's still holding is going to hold it will not fail that's right brother BR was talking about being up in Kentucky and I this is one of my favorite stories that he tells as far as the Prelude to this you understand a minute one time up in Kentucky in a Mountain Country I came from I was preaching early in the afternoon he said I was preaching on Hellfire and brimstone for the unbeliever there was those old loggers sitting back there and I said all you drunkard and he was one you better repent get right with God there been a fell come to the night in the night before that was cutting corn he had a big nail sticking his overalls he said well I I'm going to go up there we'll throw that little preacher out the window so he came to the door and someone told him that's the roughest Bunch someone told me he said that's the roughest Bunch that's around here standing there great big barly looking Fell's arms crossed beard hanging down on his face about 30 years old he was a mean looking man he kept looking at me and I just kept looking at him preaching repent or perish and he said I guess he stayed a little too long the Holy Spirit got a hold of him he fell on the floor he couldn't get to the altar quick enough he came up with his hands over his head crying God be merciful to me the next night his little daughter came down little girl handed me a bunch of flowers came when I came to the door she said brother Bill I have a new daddy at home I want to show you that I love you for coming here and preaching the gospel and letting Jesus make me a new daddy Hallelujah he said but this old drunk sitting there and I said all you drunkers all you Sinners repent and he got angry and out the door he went and he went home and he went to bed I was staying down at my grandfather's house and said while he was having the meeting going across those Hills with a lantern in your hand so then long midnight just saw the same old fell come down he started beating on the door and open he said brother brand I want you to pray for me I had the awfulest dream a while ago I just can't stand it through the night I what's the matter I he said I dreamed I was a rabbit and I was sitting out in the field just eating Clover having a good time and doing as I pleased and I said after a while I heard a ball of a hound and the Hound was right on me and I took out the run but the Hound was faster than I was and it said I happened to turn and look and there was a big rock and I heard about I heard about in that rock was a hole and I knew if I could only beat that Hound to the hole I'd be safe but if I couldn't beat it he'd have me and brother brand I was running for all that I had know at any minute I'd be gobbled up because I could feel the hot breath of the Hound as he jumped on my heels and all at once he made a grab and I slipped in the hole and when I got in there I could relax there I said that's right that is God you dreamed about he's a rock in a weary land he's a cliff in the rock for Sinners just run into it and be saved Christ is our Rock he said they'll run after everything but Christ but if you run after him amen you will find peace and safety Hallelujah Psalms 46 and verse one says God is our refuge he's our refuge and strength a very present help and trouble therefore we will not fear though the Earth gives away though the mountains be moved why cuz I'm in The Refuge y though the waters Roar and flam though the mountains tremble that is swelling there is a river whose streams make glad the city of God do you catch that in the middle of all of this confusion in the middle of all this trouble there's a river yes sir the streams whereof shall make glad and the City of God and the Holy place of the Tabernacles of the most high God is in the midst of her and she shall not be moved why because there's a fortress around you it's hidden Against The Fortress and my dream
