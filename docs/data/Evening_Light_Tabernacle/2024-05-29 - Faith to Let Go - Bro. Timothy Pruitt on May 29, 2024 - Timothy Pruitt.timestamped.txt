[41:46] 14
[41:50] amen it's good to be in the house of the
[41:54] Lord amen says when the the disciple
[41:57] verse 26 said when the disciples saw him
[42:00] walking on the sea they were troubled
[42:03] saying it is a spirit and they cried out
[42:06] for fear but straightway Jesus spake
[42:08] unto them saying be of good cheer it is
[42:11] I Be not Afraid and Peter answered him
[42:15] and said Lo Lord if thou if it be thou
[42:17] bid me come unto thee on the water and
[42:20] he said
[42:21] come and when Peter was come down out of
[42:24] the ship he walked on the water to go to
[42:27] to Jesus but when he saw the wind
[42:29] boisterous he was afraid and begin to
[42:31] sink he cried saying Lord save me and
[42:35] immediately Jesus stretched forth his
[42:37] hand and caught him said unto him oh
[42:40] thou of little faith wherefore didst
[42:42] thou doubt and when they were come to
[42:44] the ship the wind ceased then they that
[42:47] were in the ship came and worshiped him
[42:49] saying oh a truth Thou Art the Son of
[42:53] God Amen we let you be seated tonight
[42:58] i' like to speak to you tonight on faith
[43:00] to let go amen Faith to let go you know
[43:04] as I thought about this event that took

[43:10] amazing deal for a man to walk on water
[43:12] I I don't know if any of y'all know that
[43:14] but that's not really possible as far as
[43:16] humanly speaking and uh but you know
[43:20] here here they're out in the middle of
[43:22] this o this sea and they're they're
[43:24] being tossed about as we spoke about
[43:26] last Wednesday day and they see what
[43:29] they think is a Spirit come walking on
[43:31] the water because they didn't think any
[43:33] man could do this but this was more than
[43:36] a man this was God veiled in flesh and
[43:39] we can read the script he uses the seed
[43:41] he walks upon the sea and and those
[43:43] things that's in the Psalms and reading
[43:45] over them today amen that there's
[43:48] nothing impossible with God God's ruler
[43:50] over every element whether it be the
[43:53] ground or the sea or or or the air it
[43:55] does not matter he rules over that but
[43:58] could you imagine as they're watching
[44:00] this take place and they they begin to
[44:02] become fearful and they hear a voice and
[44:05] maybe they recognized this voice because
[44:07] they had heard it before and it said be
[44:09] of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid and
[44:12] and you know and Peter he he just puts
[44:15] himself out there as it were he said
[44:17] Lord if it be thou bid me come and you
[44:20] know he didn't say it is me or yeah I'm
[44:23] I've been with you I've done this and
[44:24] done gave him proof or anything and he
[44:27] didn't give him details he just says one
[44:29] word come and that's not a lot to rest
[44:32] on but one word of God is a lot to rest
[44:35] on Amen When God Says something you can
[44:38] believe it amen and it's going to work
[44:41] amen to walk on water you know maybe he
[44:43] started having by mind battles though as
[44:45] he begin to take that first move and to
[44:48] put his foot over that that that bow of
[44:51] the boat you know that's a that's a big
[44:53] deal when you do that to step from
[44:55] something that you feel comfort in you
[44:56] know he was a seaman he he was a
[44:59] fisherman he he knew how to handle ores
[45:01] but you know there was in this moment
[45:03] but yet still yet in this moment there
[45:05] was comfort in this boat cuz this boat
[45:08] was built to float it was not built to
[45:09] go down it was it was built to go across
[45:12] waves it was built to do this so there
[45:14] was something inside of them that still
[45:16] had Comfort being in that place because
[45:19] I don't read in the scripture where any
[45:20] of them had jumped out I don't read in
[45:22] the scripture where any of them had left
[45:24] the boat but they were still there even
[45:26] though the waves were very bad and it
[45:28] seemed like all hope was gone but here
[45:30] here in his mind as he begins to put his
[45:32] first foot out you know he didn't get
[45:34] God Jesus didn't give him details he
[45:37] didn't tell him how it was going to
[45:38] happen or how he could do it he just
[45:40] said come and but as long as he had a
[45:43] hand on the ship maybe he felt just to
[45:45] still a little bit safer but God has a
[45:48] way of getting us to places where we
[45:50] don't have anything to hold on but
[45:53] him amen letting go is just simply
[45:57] letting God Amen letting go is getting
[46:00] out of the way so that God can work his
[46:03] work in you amen it's not a weakness to
[46:05] let go but it's actually a strength and
[46:08] to let go letting go is to experience a
[46:11] power beyond ourselves amen because this
[46:14] was not Peter's power he didn't have the
[46:17] power to do this but it was letting go
[46:19] to experience something that he could
[46:22] not do himself Letting Go means you are
[46:25] not in control any longer
[46:27] a lot of times that's hard as human
[46:29] beings because we like to be in control
[46:31] we we like to you know have an element
[46:33] of control we like to control certain
[46:35] situations if we can but God loves to
[46:38] get us in places where we lose control
[46:41] amen you know there's some people that
[46:42] you call them overthinkers or or they
[46:45] think about things too much because they
[46:47] like control they like to have certain
[46:49] things a certain way and for it to be a
[46:51] certain thing but God many times comes
[46:54] against our humanism if I can say it
[46:56] that way and he takes us and puts us in
[46:58] a place where no matter what we do or
[47:01] how we do it we're going to fail if we
[47:03] depend upon our own our own senses our
[47:05] own abilities amen God got Peter out
[47:08] into a place amen where he couldn't grab
[47:11] a hold of anything he couldn't do
[47:13] anything on his own the only thing he
[47:15] could do is look to him amen and that is
[47:18] what God wants in our lives see he wants
[47:21] us to let loose and let God brother Bram
[47:23] said I used to preach this sermon quite
[47:25] a bit let loose and let God God just let
[47:28] loose and let God but as long as you got
[47:31] yourself into it you're in the
[47:34] way amen you know the he said the
[47:36] biggest enemy I got is William brandom
[47:39] he's always in God's way if I can just
[47:42] get him out of the way then God can go
[47:44] to work that's your worst enemy is
[47:47] yourself just get yourself out of the
[47:49] way let go he said I've often said the
[47:52] greatest enemy I got is William brandom
[47:54] he's the one that gets in God's way he's
[47:56] the the one that gets lazy he's the one
[47:58] that gets to a place sometimes he thinks
[48:00] he can do something about it but when he
[48:03] does that shoves God right out of the
[48:05] picture amen right out of the picture
[48:07] but when I get rid of that guy when I
[48:09] get to a place that he is out of the way
[48:12] then God can come over and do things
[48:15] that William brandom knows nothing about
[48:18] Hallelujah that's the way it is with a
[48:19] minister of any sort of any kind whether
[48:22] you whether whether it's the prophet or
[48:24] a pastor or evangelist amen it's getting
[48:27] ourself out of the way do you know how
[48:29] hard it is Amen to get up in front of
[48:31] people and just let go Amen Let Go of
[48:34] what you think or let go of your what
[48:36] you way way you normally act or let go
[48:39] of who you think you really are and just
[48:41] get yourself out of the way and let God
[48:44] take over amen that's what we want in
[48:46] every service amen but it ain't just the
[48:48] preacher that needs to do that we need
[48:50] to do that out there in the audience as
[48:52] well get to a place that we get our
[48:55] worst enemy out of the way
[48:58] amen our worst enemy is not the one
[49:00] sitting next to you or the one standing
[49:02] before you or the one sitting behind you
[49:04] or somewhere in the building or
[49:05] somewhere out on the street what you
[49:07] need to do is take a mirror and look
[49:09] inside of it that's your worst enemy
[49:12] that's what stops you many times from
[49:14] getting blessings from God that's what
[49:16] stops you from receiving something from
[49:18] God is that enemy that flesh that wants
[49:21] to hold on to that boat he wants to hold
[49:23] on to that safety net and not step out
[49:26] and walk to Jesus but we want to get to
[49:29] Jesus he said when when William brandom
[49:31] can get out of the way that's when God
[49:34] can use him the best he said that's when
[49:37] God can use you that's when he can use
[49:39] any of you he can use anybody when we
[49:42] get ourselves out of the way but as long
[49:45] as we got ourselves in the way then he
[49:49] can't amen as long as you go to doing
[49:53] that so you know somebody talks about
[49:55] you you know well I'm just I tell you
[49:57] what I'm going to say God can't fight
[49:59] your battle you're fighting it
[50:03] yourself amen you're fighting yourself
[50:06] he said just let loose and let him do it
[50:10] just commit it to him the greatest
[50:12] weapon I know in a Christian today is
[50:14] committing to God committed to God you
[50:16] when you can't do nothing about it just
[50:19] commit it to God and God will take care
[50:21] of
[50:22] it but you know it's our natural uh
[50:25] human uh
[50:27] want to a reaction to be want to be in
[50:30] control we want to control but you know
[50:33] how much control do you actually
[50:36] have think about it how much control do
[50:40] you actually have you did not choose
[50:42] when to be
[50:44] born anybody in here choose what day you
[50:46] wanted to be born no no you did not
[50:49] choose what gender you was going to be
[50:51] neither can you choose that
[50:54] now amen you don't you didn't choose how
[50:58] you would
[51:00] look well I want I wouldn't want to be
[51:03] 6'4 and this and God chose
[51:07] you amen God is in control of your life
[51:12] you did not choose how you were going to
[51:13] look you didn't choose what household
[51:16] you would be born in you didn't choose
[51:18] what parents you would
[51:21] have come on somebody you did not choose
[51:24] your DNA
[51:26] you didn't even get to choose what
[51:28] country you would be born in or the
[51:30] culture you would be born in you did not
[51:32] get to choose the day the month or the
[51:35] year you was going to be born in you did
[51:38] not choose whether you would be healthy
[51:40] or not or your strength is or your
[51:42] strengths or choose your weaknesses you
[51:44] didn't get to choose none of that you
[51:46] didn't even get to choose your
[51:48] personality you didn't even get to
[51:50] choose your temperament in reality we
[51:53] had nothing to say in who what where or
[51:57] when of the beginning of our resistance
[52:01] was but we want to be in
[52:06] control well I you know I would but I
[52:08] that's just not me no we're still in
[52:10] control that's that's that's you putting
[52:12] on the brakes amen that's you grabbing
[52:15] back a hold of the boat and trying to
[52:16] get one in and one leg in and one leg
[52:18] out God wants you all the
[52:23] way amen it's easy to you know to say
[52:27] well I I I I I I just want to give God
[52:29] everything and we still got one leg in
[52:31] the boat and one leg Out on the Ocean
[52:33] testing the
[52:35] waters come on somebody we we want to
[52:38] test the service and see how it's going
[52:40] to be we want to test the sermon and how
[52:42] it's going to be no God wants you all
[52:45] in he wants you you're not we are not as
[52:49] human beings we are not really in
[52:51] control of
[52:54] anything Amen in reality
[52:57] we had nothing to say who we were what
[52:59] we
[53:02] were I'm sorry to put this on you but if
[53:05] God would have chose he could have made
[53:06] you a
[53:08] giraffe or whatever but he chose you to
[53:11] be born in a certain family with certain
[53:15] characteristics about you to look a
[53:17] certain way I I get amazed I really get
[53:19] amazed at the greatness of God you want
[53:21] to think about the greatness of God
[53:23] think about how many ways of face a
[53:25] human face can be
[53:27] made they ain't a person in this little
[53:30] bit of what 150 200 people whatever is
[53:33] here tonight that looks the same you
[53:35] might even be brothers and sisters but
[53:36] you still don't look the
[53:39] same now I know there's identical twins
[53:41] I understand all of that amen but what
[53:43] what I'm talking about is God is is in
[53:46] control of what you are who you are
[53:49] where you are sure I'm not trying to say
[53:52] you don't have choices I understand all
[53:54] that but God is ultimately ly in control
[53:57] of your life you did not choose God God
[54:01] chose
[54:04] you do you know the percentages that it
[54:08] would take for you to be born you young
[54:10] people to be born in a message beli in
[54:13] home you could have been born out there
[54:15] in the world and and and you may have
[54:18] found your way one day as many others
[54:20] found their way Amen to the truth and
[54:22] not even born but you got the you got
[54:24] the chance to be born in a believer's
[54:27] home to be be raised up in a believer's
[54:31] atmosphere am man what a blessing that
[54:33] really is we shouldn't cha at that and
[54:36] get upset oh I wish I was this i w no
[54:38] God made you who you
[54:40] are what you are and where you
[54:50] are so there is only one who chose that
[54:53] for us that's God he chose what day you
[54:56] was was going to be born what month you
[54:58] was going to be born year you was going
[54:59] to be born he chose where you was going
[55:02] to be born he watched your lineage all
[55:04] the way down through making sure you was
[55:06] going to come exactly at the right
[55:09] time Hallelujah you are not here by
[55:14] accident come on somebody quit letting
[55:17] the devil tell you you're an accident
[55:20] you are not here by accident you're here
[55:22] by the plan of almighty God
[55:26] God put you here and he placed you here
[55:29] and he put something inside of you to
[55:31] want to go to
[55:33] him do you understand how many people
[55:36] the percentage of this world that don't
[55:38] even want to go to him if they saw him
[55:40] they wouldn't even speak to him they
[55:41] don't even want to acknowledge Him but
[55:43] God put something on the inside of you
[55:46] to want to go to where he was where he
[55:51] is many times when in our greatest
[55:53] struggle we're trying to stay afloat
[55:56] we're trying to stay above the problems
[55:59] he's just wanting you to let he's just
[56:01] wanting you to let
[56:02] go Letting Go means turning those fears
[56:06] over to God and learning to trust him
[56:08] more Letting Go does not mean that fears
[56:11] do not exist in your life but it means
[56:14] that your trust in God is greater and
[56:17] stronger than any
[56:20] fear he said well let loose let go how
[56:23] do I do it just let go that's all you
[56:25] have to do take God God's
[56:27] word well he only said come well that's

[56:37] a man walk on water one word made a man
[56:41] walk on water and defy nature and defy
[56:44] gravity one word how much more will the
[56:47] words of almighty God do for you amen
[56:50] it'll do more than just walk on the
[56:52] water it'll make you walk over your
[56:53] trials it'll make you walk over the head
[56:55] of every devil it'll make you walk over
[56:58] your situation it'll make you rise above

[58:33] out the boat well let me just get up
[58:35] worked up enough where I can dance in
[58:37] the spirit and speak in tongues in this
[58:38] boat then I'll step out no he took God
[58:41] at his word he let loose and let go and
[58:44] God took him through amen he said see
[58:47] that's exactly what happened to the
[58:48] woman that was out there picking up a
[58:50] few sticks and it was a big de dry
[58:53] desert and it was a a famine in the land
[58:56] there hadn't been no rain a drought that
[58:58] was going and she's picking up the last
[59:00] few sticks to make a last meal for her
[59:02] and her her son and she hears a voice
[59:05] and it says make me one
[59:07] first she had to let go of a lot of
[59:10] things right
[59:12] then cuz she knew that she only had she
[59:14] only had enough meal and enough oil for
[59:17] one cake and she was going to eat make
[59:18] that and her and her son was going to
[59:20] eat it and die and she hears a voice
[59:23] make me one first first
[59:27] and she let go of her natural instinct
[59:30] to
[59:32] survive her natural instinct to provide
[59:35] for her son and and and and to allow him
[59:38] to maybe he's going but she knew that
[59:40] this was not just any
[59:42] voice she recognized who that was that
[59:45] was the prophet of Israel and she knew
[59:47] that he had was something behind that
[59:50] voice and she went in there and she made
[59:53] for one first she said what was it see
[59:55] there seek ye first the kingdom of God
[59:58] in his righteousness not the kingdom of
[1:00:00] God in a little noise not the kingdom of
[1:00:02] God in a little motion not the kingdom
[1:00:04] of God this and that but God and his
[1:00:06] righteousness and everything else will
[1:00:09] be added to
[1:00:10] you the Widow heard faith comes by
[1:00:13] hearing and hearing the word she said
[1:00:16] that's the word of the Lord that's the
[1:00:17] prophet of Israel I know it's the truth
[1:00:20] that's the word of God she didn't run to
[1:00:22] her neighbor and ask what do you
[1:00:24] think the preacher said this but what do
[1:00:26] you
[1:00:29] think honestly God's not even concerned
[1:00:32] about what you think or anybody else
[1:00:34] thinks we are only the ones that are
[1:00:37] concerned about what everybody else
[1:00:39] thinks she wanted to get in to get it
[1:00:43] all out she let go she let go of what
[1:00:46] she had that she might get
[1:00:51] more come on somebody she let go of what
[1:00:55] she had that she might get more that's
[1:00:58] what the world needs today is a good
[1:01:01] oldfashioned letting go of what you
[1:01:03] got amen she dumped out so she could get
[1:01:06] filled up she dumped out all the oil she
[1:01:09] had she dumped out all the meal she had
[1:01:11] and when she dumped it all in there God
[1:01:13] came down and he filled it back up
[1:01:16] again Hallelujah every time she dumped
[1:01:19] it out he filled it up every time she
[1:01:22] what does he say every time she let go
[1:01:24] God gave her more
[1:01:26] more listen God wants to give you more
[1:01:29] than yesterday's experience he wants to
[1:01:32] give you more than last camp meeting or
[1:01:34] our next camp meeting he wants to give
[1:01:36] you an everyday upto-date
[1:01:39] experience but it takes letting go so
[1:01:41] you can get
[1:01:44] more God's not a unjust judge or or some
[1:01:48] some evil father that you know
[1:01:51] you you ask for bread and he's going to
[1:01:53] give you a stone
[1:01:56] that's not God if God is asking you to
[1:01:59] let go that means he's got something
[1:02:01] better in
[1:02:04] store amen if God's asking you to
[1:02:08] release some things he's got something
[1:02:10] better for
[1:02:12] you well you know well I got I got I got
[1:02:15] this issue brother Timothy I got this a
[1:02:16] in my heart and I got I got this
[1:02:18] bitterness and I can't forgive over do
[1:02:20] you understand that that's just a bunch
[1:02:21] of cheap

[1:06:36] dumped it out again in the preacher's
[1:06:38] plate and it came down again direct
[1:06:41] quote he dumped it out again and he
[1:06:43] filled it up when you say you got faith
[1:06:46] for Divine Healing something strikes you
[1:06:47] it says move out that's a confirmation
[1:06:49] that God has received your faith for
[1:06:51] Divine Healing that's right when you got
[1:06:53] courage to put your faith in action
[1:06:55] that's when you say you got faith but
[1:06:56] you're afraid to let it go your faith is
[1:06:58] dead but when you got faith and willing
[1:07:00] to let it go then God's confirming it
[1:07:03] with signs following and you will see
[1:07:05] your
[1:07:07] healing you will see your healing what
[1:07:10] if Peter stopped that night to figure it
[1:07:12] out now Lord you told me to walk you
[1:07:15] said come but let me see now I'm
[1:07:17] strictly I got some scientific
[1:07:19] background I know this formula of water
[1:07:21] it's H2O why no man can walk on hydrogen
[1:07:24] and oxygen there's there no need to me
[1:07:26] even tried you ask me something
[1:07:27] impossible Peter would have never walked
[1:07:30] on
[1:07:31] water he would have never figured out
[1:07:33] how it was he he would have just took
[1:07:35] God at his but he just took God his word
[1:07:37] with walking on that's what we got to do
[1:07:39] don't try to figure out how God is going
[1:07:41] to do these things how God's going to do
[1:07:43] this how God's going to do that just
[1:07:45] accept it and go on what if Moses turned
[1:07:48] aside to see the burning bushes well let
[1:07:50] me let me take some of them leaves off
[1:07:52] and see what what really burnt this let
[1:07:53] me check it in the chemical lab let me
[1:07:55] check it out but he never that was he he
[1:07:57] had never approached God he would have
[1:08:00] never got
[1:08:01] anywhere but he just settled his heart
[1:08:04] took off his shoes of what he said and
[1:08:06] God sent him down there to deliver amen
[1:08:09] Peter if he was doing you know he he was
[1:08:12] doing all right though he stepped out of
[1:08:14] the boat he's doing real good but he got
[1:08:20] scared it's real easy to get scared when
[1:08:23] you realize you have no control
[1:08:28] that's why we got backseat
[1:08:32] drivers they get scared cuz they don't
[1:08:35] have a lick of
[1:08:39] control Hallelujah
[1:08:43] anyhow I mean you parents knew how it
[1:08:46] was when you was teaching your young and
[1:08:47] how to how to drive you didn't have you
[1:08:51] hit the
[1:08:52] break stomp a hole in that
[1:08:56] do you not see that car it's a police
[1:08:58] car in front of you for goodness
[1:09:03] sake one guy said he said they had so
[1:09:07] many miracles on the way to church from
[1:09:09] his son driving he said how'd that tree
[1:09:10] move out of the
[1:09:14] way but you don't have no control when
[1:09:16] you don't have control then you get
[1:09:19] afraid when you lose control it's it's
[1:09:22] hard to stay stay focused and stay
[1:09:25] looking at the right
[1:09:27] things when you lose control of a
[1:09:30] situation when the doctor says there
[1:09:32] ain't nothing you can
[1:09:35] do there's nothing there's no hope it's
[1:09:38] over
[1:09:39] with fear wants to come in and things
[1:09:42] wants to go a in your mind and this is
[1:09:45] where Peter was when he got out way from
[1:09:47] that boat he realized I don't have no
[1:09:49] more
[1:09:51] control I forgot to put the life vest on
[1:09:55] yeah
[1:09:56] and he's about halfway to Jesus and he
[1:09:58] realized he's looking he said man need
[1:09:59] some big waves I thought they was big in
[1:10:02] that boat but now I'm standing on them
[1:10:04] they're they're huge look at him and he
[1:10:06] starts looking at all around him and
[1:10:08] what's going on and he ain't got no
[1:10:10] control of the situation no more and he
[1:10:12] starts
[1:10:14] sinking and people and and I I've used
[1:10:17] it too and just used it just then of
[1:10:19] Peter getting his eyes off of Jesus and
[1:10:21] getting but listen he wasn't the one
[1:10:24] that was a failure that night
[1:10:25] night the ones that were a failure was
[1:10:28] the ones that was still in the
[1:10:30] boat they never they would never get out
[1:10:34] of their comfort zone or or their
[1:10:36] ability they would never come to that
[1:10:37] place where they would completely let
[1:10:44] go it's not it's not a fun place to be
[1:10:47] when you do can't grab a hold of
[1:10:49] something your world's twirling around
[1:10:52] could you imagine this wasn't no just
[1:10:54] platform he was standing the winds and
[1:10:56] the waves were blowing he's up and down
[1:10:58] he's he's got all kinds of things his
[1:11:00] equilibrium was all messed up no doubt
[1:11:02] probably getting dizzy and things around
[1:11:04] him and but if he could have just stayed
[1:11:08] focused the White Caps are man they're
[1:11:11] biging them heels the phones breaking
[1:11:16] my Jesus just said
[1:11:18] Come Peter said well if it's you Lord
[1:11:21] I'll just walk what a
[1:11:24] man but but when he got his eyes on the
[1:11:26] waves he got
[1:11:28] scared I'm going to walk because the
[1:11:30] word said I was F the next thing though
[1:11:33] he started looking at his symptoms he
[1:11:34] started looking at the waves he he
[1:11:36] started looking at the issues he started
[1:11:38] looking at the circumstances and he got
[1:11:41] scared and he began to
[1:11:44] sink but that ain't the end of the
[1:11:47] story even in a scared condition and out
[1:11:50] of control he said God help
[1:11:53] me Jesus I'm I'm about to drown and
[1:11:56] Jesus reached down and he picked him up
[1:11:59] and he made him walk on the water
[1:12:01] again amen listen God he sees you out
[1:12:04] there and he sees you in your struggle
[1:12:06] and he realizes he's not he can't
[1:12:08] control this it's over his head it's
[1:12:10] over his pay grade he can't do nothing
[1:12:13] about it but if he'll just look to me
[1:12:15] I'll take care of him if he'll call on
[1:12:18] me when he's in trouble I'll be there to
[1:12:20] answer him I'll be there to move on his
[1:12:23] behalf and he'll make you walk on water
[1:12:26] the second
[1:12:32] time Peter just took God at his
[1:12:36] word left everything he could to get to
[1:12:39] a place that only God
[1:12:41] could it's easy to criticize ones who's
[1:12:44] dared take God at his word and looking
[1:12:47] like they're about to
[1:12:49] fail well when the one has taken God at
[1:12:52] his word it's not up to their own
[1:12:54] ability ities anymore it's up to God's
[1:13:02] abilities brand used this story he said
[1:13:04] like the good old brother colored
[1:13:06] brother down
[1:13:07] south said he was packing a Bible and he
[1:13:10] couldn't even read his name said Moses
[1:13:12] why you packed that Bible he said
[1:13:13] because it's the word of
[1:13:15] God said what do you believe it he said
[1:13:17] well sure I believe it I believe it from
[1:13:20] cover to cover I believe the cover also
[1:13:22] because as God's holy Bible wrote on it
[1:13:26] well how do you know it's a Holy Bible
[1:13:27] how do you know it is I believe it
[1:13:29] that's
[1:13:30] all well you know you can't even read it
[1:13:32] but I still believe it that's that's all
[1:13:34] he had to have just believe it Moses
[1:13:37] would you do anything that Bible said to
[1:13:39] do yes sir and the Bible said so I'd do
[1:13:43] it there you are he said all right MOS
[1:13:47] now what if that stone fence there if
[1:13:48] the Lord told you to jump through that
[1:13:50] stone fence how would you jump through
[1:13:53] that fence he said does the Bible say
[1:13:55] for Moses to jump through the stone
[1:13:58] fence he said well what if God would
[1:14:02] speak to you and just tell you to jump
[1:14:04] through the stone fence he said if it
[1:14:06] was God and he told me to jump I'd
[1:14:11] jump well how you going to get through
[1:14:14] that fence without a hole in it he said
[1:14:16] if it was God he'd have a hole there
[1:14:18] when MOS got
[1:14:22] there amen that's how you believe the
[1:14:25] word of God of God's word said it I
[1:14:27] believe it that settles
[1:14:29] it I can run through a troop and leap
[1:14:33] over a wall they ain't enough armies of
[1:14:35] the devil can hold a child of God when
[1:14:38] they realize the power that is calling
[1:14:40] them to the other
[1:14:42] side amen when God is calling you to do
[1:14:45] something and God is calling you to do
[1:14:47] to move out of your comfort zone and the
[1:14:50] place that you're in and the situation
[1:14:52] you're in there ain't enough Devils that
[1:14:54] can keep you from from it if you believe
[1:14:56] what is spoken about
[1:14:59] you you dare take God's word and stand
[1:15:02] there and say it
[1:15:05] so he said like this poor little nervous
[1:15:07] woman here thinks she's going to die and
[1:15:10] everything else is wrong with her you're
[1:15:12] not
[1:15:14] dying how can I do it brother bradam
[1:15:17] just take his word and step on it once
[1:15:19] one time once stand on the word see what
[1:15:21] happens and when you stand there tell
[1:15:23] the Devil he's a liar
[1:15:26] tell the Devil he's a liar amen you've
[1:15:29] been and he said you've been in
[1:15:31] menopause all these years about 57 years
[1:15:33] old get away from the thing it's the
[1:15:35] devil take God's word and say by his
[1:15:38] stripes I'm
[1:15:41] Healed watch what takes place then
[1:15:43] you'll quit thinking you got heart
[1:15:45] attacks and everything you don't have no
[1:15:47] heart attacks and all that stuff it's a
[1:15:48] lie you don't have it just believe God's
[1:15:51] word and tell the Devil he's a liar
[1:15:55] but it takes you stepping out and
[1:15:57] standing upon the word of God cuz I want
[1:16:00] you to understand something what Peter
[1:16:02] was really standing on was not just the
[1:16:04] water he was standing on the
[1:16:06] word the word said come so if the word
[1:16:10] said Come Peter could
[1:16:12] come and if the word said you could be
[1:16:14] healed amen you're not standing on
[1:16:16] anything but you're standing upon the
[1:16:18] word of God you're not standing upon
[1:16:20] your symptoms you're not standing upon
[1:16:22] the sickness you're standing upon the
[1:16:24] word word the word said you could be
[1:16:27] healed
[1:16:33] come but if we say we have
[1:16:36] faith and afraid to step out and claim
[1:16:39] our faith and put it to work then our
[1:16:41] faith doesn't do much
[1:16:44] good the Bible said that faith without
[1:16:46] works is dead just without just as the
[1:16:49] body without the spirit is dead so is
[1:16:52] faith without works we must believe
[1:17:00] him brother Timothy I don't know how I'm
[1:17:02] going make we must believe
[1:17:05] him brother Timothy it's so dark we must
[1:17:10] believe
[1:17:12] him well you have you seen what's going

[1:17:17] believe
[1:17:21] him well what about my sickness we must
[1:17:25] believe
[1:17:27] him come and as we believe we must act
[1:17:31] on our confession we can't say it we
[1:17:35] can't even say it unless we really
[1:17:37] believe it and then what if we really
[1:17:38] believe it then we can say it with all
[1:17:40] our hearts and know that God answers our
[1:17:42] prayer and will give us the desires of
[1:17:43] our heart brother when you got a courage

[1:21:06] word it was a blind man we've talked
[1:21:09] about him many times blind bartus
[1:21:11] screamed out Jesus thou son of David
[1:21:13] have mercy on me he was two squares away
[1:21:16] city blocks maybe away but he realized
[1:21:19] this was the only chance he was ever
[1:21:21] going to
[1:21:22] have he must get his attention he must
[1:21:25] get an audition with him or he'd be
[1:21:27] blind
[1:21:29] always well then how would you act if
[1:21:31] that was
[1:21:33] you I wish he said I wish that would be
[1:21:35] an attitude of every person
[1:21:38] tonight if you can only get the
[1:21:41] attention of
[1:21:45] Jesus you said well brother Brown how
[1:21:47] how do you how do I know I get this
[1:21:49] audition when something begins to tell
[1:21:51] you in the heart this is the truth
[1:21:54] that's Jesus talking to you so just
[1:21:57] remember when you attract his attention
[1:21:59] he begins to talk back then raise up and
[1:22:02] begin to thank him thank him like this
[1:22:05] blind man
[1:22:06] did well I feel so bad when people try
[1:22:09] to make God something of history and he
[1:22:11] I want to ask you something what good is
[1:22:12] a god of History if he isn't a God today
[1:22:14] what good is the Bible of something
[1:22:16] yesterday if it ain't the same today
[1:22:17] what good is a god of Moses if he ain't
[1:22:19] the same today what good is a god of any
[1:22:21] Prophet if he ain't the same today but
[1:22:23] he is the same today he's the same God
[1:22:25] today yesterday and forever you say well
[1:22:28] I have faith to believe but you're
[1:22:29] afraid to Let it Loose what good does it
[1:22:31] do a bird to have wings if he isn't out
[1:22:34] of the cage if he don't ever get out of
[1:22:36] the cage he don't ever stretch out of
[1:22:38] what good is those wings he got to get
[1:22:40] out and throw his wings into the air in
[1:22:43] this church tonight there's enough Faith
[1:22:45] to heal every person
[1:22:48] here can I say it present tense in this
[1:22:52] church tonight there's enough faith in
[1:22:54] this building to heal every person
[1:22:58] here amen he said but what is it you're
[1:23:00] afraid to get out of the cage get out of
[1:23:02] the cage don't feed your bird no more
[1:23:05] food if you're not going to let him
[1:23:07] loose if you don't let him out of the
[1:23:08] cage what good is it going to do with it
[1:23:10] but turn him
[1:23:14] loose oh god he's a god he's not just a
[1:23:18] god of History he's the same day to data
[1:23:20] and forever when did our God lose power
[1:23:23] when did he ever do anything different
[1:23:25] when did he stop healing when did he
[1:23:26] stop delivering when did he stop setting
[1:23:29] people free turn him
[1:23:34] loose Pharisees read the same
[1:23:38] Bible but they didn't have enough Faith
[1:23:41] to put into practice what they
[1:23:43] read every denomination today reads the
[1:23:46] same Bible but they'll tell you God
[1:23:48] don't heal Matthew Mark 16 is not you
[1:23:52] know inspired
[1:23:57] I love that story about that woman he
[1:24:00] found a little church that to pray for
[1:24:01] she got real sick got prayed for her she
[1:24:04] got healed and her son come home from
[1:24:05] Cemetery I me sem
[1:24:10] Seminary come home from that she he said
[1:24:13] I I heard you was real bad you look good
[1:24:14] and she said yeah got healed said what
[1:24:17] do you mean said well I found this
[1:24:19] church that believed in Mark chapter 16
[1:24:21] they shall lay hands upon the sick and
[1:24:23] they shall recover and I went down there
[1:24:24] and ask him to pray for me and God
[1:24:26] healed me he said well Mom we we learned
[1:24:29] up there in the Seminary that that ain't
[1:24:31] inspired no
[1:24:32] more she started
[1:24:34] shouting bless God hallelujah said well
[1:24:38] if God can do that with an uninspired
[1:24:40] scripture what can he do with the
[1:24:46] inspired but I'm here to tell you it's
[1:24:48] not uninspired it's the inspiration of
[1:24:52] God it still works
[1:25:05] but you got to be willing to let
[1:25:07] go somebody's got faith enough that'll
[1:25:10] step out and take the word that's what
[1:25:13] we need somebody to practice what they
[1:25:15] believe faith without works is dead
[1:25:19] doesn't do you any good to have faith
[1:25:21] you say well I believe that's the Bible
[1:25:23] Well if it's the Bible it's got
[1:25:26] promises and if you believe that's true
[1:25:28] the only thing you have to do is let
[1:25:30] your faith loose and practice what you
[1:25:41] believe I felt it
