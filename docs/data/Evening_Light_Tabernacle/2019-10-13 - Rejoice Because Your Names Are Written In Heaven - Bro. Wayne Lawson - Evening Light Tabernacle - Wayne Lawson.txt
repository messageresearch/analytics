was like to be the overcomers of that dark wicked agent loud to see what was it like how did you get through that without getting any sin on you they've been that's like a mechanic changing the motor not getting any grease on his hands and the Church of the Living God goes through this kind of an age and don't get sin on them not even one spot or wrinkle I'll tell you what a blessing amen to know that God has prepared something for us amen it's been really a certain privilege to be here with you in these meetings I'll tell you what a blessing what a day amen to rejoice in the Lord and sister Kimberly said this morning we come in the room there she says but when you gonna preach us happy I said well I'm going I want to try and she said well you should have answered me by saying if you ain't happy about now you're probably ain't getting there I said that's pretty good if this meeting stirs you up a little bit man you get this you would sweat a man I'll tell you what a blessing hey man what a meeting [Music] man a good place to get the holy ghost I'll tell you a man it's a good place to get get get a revival in your heart and amen what a blessing we want to thank brother Tim a man and his work here and you that are behind him and all of you that's come so far to to make these things possible I know some of you have invested a lot of money in that seat that you're sitting in amen that you know God will reward you greatly amen for all the sacrifices that you've made and we won't appreciate my brother Tim this morning I do want to say that we greatly appreciate him making this kind of meeting possible [Music] [Applause] [Music] I know that he's got musicians and ministering teams brother Timothy here is an associate these men of God undo audio the Deacons and trustees and all these things are made possible but you know it's written in the scripture and the random tells that he said that the Holy Ghost was bound about treats and doggies for 2,000 years he said but in the latter days that would be let loose now what does that really mean there was nothing wrong with the Holy Ghost but Creed's and darkness and traditions had bound it but there's going to come some people in the end time it's going to take the traditions and the creeds and the binds and they're going to throw them away and say holy spirit have your way and gods give us some elders that believe that and thank God for our elders who believe these kinds of things remain and belong in the Church of the Living God because the intellectuals would take these things away from you if you'd let them but God does give us elders that says no these things belong in the church this is the property of the bride of Jesus Christ amen and we think want for them today and I want to say that it's been a great privilege to share the platform of these men that have preached this message with without favor but with power amen and I know that many of you gonna go home with stories and testimonies all these things surely it's a great honor amen and we have my father-in-law mother-in-law and Vernon DD with us they go to brother Jason Jackson's good to have him here from Arkansas and man and you know it's always a blessing some of you I know that you heard the curses of in-laws well it's not all truth because I got good in-laws so it tells you that that that is possible that you can have a tremendous relationship and and my family here with me my wife Karissa she's a tremendous lady and we sure appreciate her traveling with us and it's a lot of sacrifice but she's done it for years and I know there has to be a special crown in heaven for her amen for all of her sacrifices and we want to just for a moment to balance and let's just speak to the Lord father it has been such a tremendous time Lord a vibration of praise and honor to be your children just runs through our veins to think that we could be the children of God like you a great God of heaven whether far to get powering when the enemy would do is hurt Lord you have rose up and put your hand against it and what we're so thankful to be able to come here and gather with children and my precious faith and the Lord to cry on the altars and to share our tears and our hearts and Lord and then to rejoice together and to feel the victories of one another's over Cummings and father what an hour that it is even this morning but it's only a reflection of what it would be someday when we stack up our arms and the battles are all over and we set down in heaven and Lord we'll sit there and talk it over for ten thousand years of the victories and what you've done in our midst O Lord and we pray this morning father as we have gathered in this building that Nord that you will rebuke every spirit of unbelief and fear and ungodliness that holds your children I pray that the spirit of Liberty would so strike this building God that there not be one left without liberty this morning but father may ever woman man child may ever tradition and creep be broken from their mind that they would have a Liberty to rejoice and move into the glories that you have prepared for them I ask you this morning that you would bless them bless the audience that is visible and them that are invisible father I pray that you bless each one of them today father we ask these things now in the name of Jesus Christ we pray a man and a man and may God bless you as you have your Bibles today from the Book of Luke we want to read here the Book of Luke from the tenth chapter certainly want to say that we want to say God bless you and from brother ray Erikson and the church there in Bluffton amen I'm here I'm supposed to be giving greetings sometimes I forget it I have all these things and if I talk very long I forget so much and but I want to definitely say God bless you from the church there Luke chapter 10 and the 20th the verse of course this is Jesus speaking you know I was saying the 20th first let's just back up and read here from the 17th verse and the 70 returned again with joy saying Lord even the Devils are subject unto us through thy name and he said unto them I beheld Satan as lightning falling from heaven for behold I give unto you power to tread upon the serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you notwithstanding in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are written and have in that hour Jesus rejoiced in the spirit I don't know if you remember last year brother brother Ronald being pointed that out that Jesus rejoiced in spirits the first time I've noticed that in the scripture actually all these years because I've just never thought about Jesus shouting to be honest but if you want to go read the Greek it actually means to leap with joy now I know that don't go well with Baptist theology but it's in the Bible that Jesus leaped with a joy kind of got to be careful how you think about it now aren't you Jesus did that rejoiced in the spirit and said I thank thee O Father the Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and thou has revealed in that amazing brother mem uses this a lot in the message has revealed them unto babes even so the father for it seemed good in thy sight and all things are delivered to me of my father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and to whom the son will reveal him and he turned again unto his disciples and said privately blessed are the eyes which see these things that you see we ask the Lord to bless his word as you may be seated I want to speak to you just for a minute this morning rejoice your names are written in heaven rejoice your names are written in heaven it did amazing that the the book is actually in heaven the prophet uses this scripture in Luke chapter 10 the church age book is very got a got a tremendous riding on it and you'll have to go read it because there's much more than I could cover in this service this morning but one thing that we know for sure according to Jesus that the names were written in the book was in heaven now one thing we want to make sure of is that in the scripture Jesus is not saying that we don't have power over the devil's because he's actually said I've beheld Satan fallen from heaven as lightning so he's actually telling us that Satan has actually fell from his position as the son start taking their positions and he has given us power over the devils now there actually is a couple Commission's on the church there's the first Commission and then the last Commission is that right and both of them Commission's had to church with power over the devil amen so one thing we got to be sure of this morning that we don't let someone take that scripture and turn it around to mean that the church wouldn't have power over the devil of course we have power over the devil the very the very origin of your life the very thing that you were created for was actually to bruise the head of the serpent that's that's in the scripture for the woman seed should brew the head of the serpent and that woman seed turned out to be Abraham seed and the scripture says that you that are dead in Christ are Abraham's seed and heir according to the promises then every devil is actually subject under the Church of the Living God amen and I'll tell you it's a powerful thing when you start recognizing your authority over the enemy and over the devil amen but Jesus is saying that there's a there's a level here amen that is a little higher in understanding and he's telling you that that's where your real rejoicing are to be him because of course even the Antichrist spirits was going to manifest portions of the word and and and they was actually a Judas was here right in the ministry at this time casting out Devils amen but but but Jesus is letting them know that there is a separation here and there are some of these names that are actually written in heaven and men that are written in a portion of this room we'll just pick the way the prophet takes it in the Lamb's Book of Life now there's one thing that's for sure is that everything is actually pre-planned by God do you know that there was a time that you actually knew these things but brother M says you're darkened to it now he said there's only been one man on the earth that actually knew what happened before that's right he said father glorify me with the glory I had before you before the foundation of the world he was the Incarnate God and he could move back there and know what it is but our minds are blackened to that in other words we can't remember but we don't have any knowledge of what it was before creation or back before I burst but Jesus did have knowledge of what it was before the world ever even began amen you know the prophet of God says that we're actually ordained and predestinated and predestinated means the destination of anything that was pre saw by God he says now that's not still milk hey man that's not skim milk anything that is pre solved by God has predestinated or ordained he says now if we go over and in the book of Ephesians in the first chapter he said I'm afraid that we're missing it they said that you maybe you think that I'm just saying this but I want you to listen closely and we'll get down to the church in a few minutes Paul is actually addressing in Ephesians 1 directly to the shoulder of the church and that's what we're doing tonight for this is not for babies this is for grown-ups this is not for babies and fission chapter 1 and verse 4 said according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love you say in love now according to the Bible it says we're in that loved us segment marina style of this been in the book of Romans Paul answers in Romans chapter 9 for Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated and both of illness before they were ever even born but God by his foreknowledge understood the nature's of them to children and told us before they were born one I love and the other I hate but the man says in the message of hearing acting recognizing he actually says that this is a picture it meant of the end time and of two groups in the end time of the carnal pigment and the spiritual churches and before they ever come into existence God already wrote that he's going to love one and he's going to hate the other just like he knew he would love Jacob in Haiti so he knew he would love the spiritual and he would hate the carnal he meant God could actually for know this and see it having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will he meant in that beautiful having predestinated us unto a place of an option Amen go back to Ephesians 1 in 4 according as he has chosen us in him he now according as he who is that he that's God chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having done this before the foundation amendment I think that's a key point this morning having done this before and meant before the earth was created having done this before the angels are created he done this before anything was ever created so before the devil was in existence God already has and chose a men that would be greater than the devil before the devil ever got there to think before the devil before the earth before sin before time before that would see anything God already chose this before it can ever happen you saw but by the way you don't know what's happening but I know before that happened that God already made a choice you said when this happened and that happen in this situation but enough before that situation that before that and before the altar that before the devil before there was a star before there was a earth before that was an angel before there was any faint god he meant close us in him before the foundation of the world that means to tell me that barring the devil there ain't no circumstance there ain't no situation there's nothing I'm doing what God in eternity God is already having sewed up before you ever got here God already decided that you were gonna be in victory this morning no devil can do anything about it because before before now that's a powerful thing to me amen before Amen I tell you this a man before amen you see a man that this actually brings something beautiful Amen according to the Lamb's Book of Life brother BAM says this he said a believer he said have you got your joy shoes on these are my joy shoes have you got you toys shoes on sister joy you got your shoes on you got some joy shoes on amen you know what I think I've been watching some people with their joy shoes I've been seeing some people this weekend with her choice shoes huh I saw people cutting up and running and dancing inside and rejoicing amen they were wearing their joy shoes listen if you're a Christian you are truly a God's child then the Bible says now that's not a preacher of the Bible said he said your names were actually written in the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundation of the world the same time that Christ that God sent Christ to be slain he wrote your name with his there you are your name is actually written all he deceived all great and small church members pretended Christians he deceived the whole whose names were not written he said now not in the church book or in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world God wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life amen bleh the spoken word now imagine this have you got your joy shoes on because brother man's going to tell you something amen that is actually ain't meant been given to the church for a sake of rejoicing he's saying that if you want to if you really want to rejoice now here it's a place you can rejoice Amen that God put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundation of the world and he did it by the spoken word I always wondered how'd he write our name on the book there before there was books before there was anything how did he do it up there but the prophet of God told us how it happened he said he wrote it by the spoken word Amen can you imagine that God actually spoke your name before the found a the work that God has spoke your name before that was anything God knew that was going to be a believer in this thing God me that would be an overcomer in this thing and he actually spoke your name to think that that name was actually spoken before the world ever began that God before Adam and Eve was in the Garden of Eden he spoke that night then when Eve was actually falling in the Garden of Eden as the first Eve God already knew that he had a second Eve who was going to not fall but she was going to stand now the puppet of God said do you see that first he fail she failed because she failed from the word he said but did you see the second II she can not fall because this one will be the word do you see we're not falling from the word because we're actually the word that was spoken before the world's ever even began do you see that word he cannot return unto the Lord Boyd for whatever God has spoken it shall accomplish that one it is set out to do what God speaks a word it will be fulfilled that's God has already spoken it then you're a part of the word now I don't know about you but sometimes I read the scripture in Revelation 13 and revelation 17 and I read about the Beast and and I read how he deceived the whole world and how that heel heel caused all these troubles and the scripture said that everything upon the earth shall worship the image of the Beast except those whose names are not written I think I think it's amazing that in the middle of revelation 13 in the middle of revelation 17 when God is describing the revelation of the beast and his deception that it just in case as a believer reading that scripture see what happens when you start reading about all that deception you start reading about all of that the devil starts putting it in the minds of the people well maybe that you're going to that maybe you're gonna be caught now how do you know but right in the middle that there's a little space in there that says except those whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life soul just in case a part of that bride is reading the Bible about deception God let John put a little something there and said that don't forget now I want you to remember I have not forgotten that I have spoken a name and they will not be deceived in the hour of deception but they're going to stand Amen according to the Bible that false Christ shall rise the boy we've seen that Henry basquiat shall arise make man false prophets shall show great signs and so much if it were possible they would deceive the very elect brother and said that word elect comes from election they meant then that would be a deception if there wasn't an election but because there has been an election God isn't elected amen then God will not allow Satan to touch that life with deception do you know that's a people on this earth right now who cannot be deceived I know I thought sometimes fear wants to grip your mind and the Saints as well and this is going to happen and this is going to happen but you've got to recognize hate men that God has already spoke something concerning ain't bride in the last days but in the time of deception she can not be deceived because she's been elected to not be deceived but to standing that they sent my to think that he spoke your name mother and said see he spoke your name he meant now in perfection mother man said not only Christ was slain to take away sin but your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundation of the world that God wrote your name associated with years before the foundation of the world now Satan make them get scared now get them to doubt that in that something make them scared out so a prophet is teaching us something that will take all of the feeder out of the church he's teaching us something that will take all the fear out of your life do you see if you put things based on your abilities based on what you can think and what you can do and what you can say then saying will always keep you under the fear that maybe you didn't do enough maybe you didn't say enough maybe you wasn't just able to do that hate men but with you moving off of you and you put it on to God then God has given us more than enough to conquer every devil every power the blood was more than enough to take ever sin and his word is enough to defeat every devil it's alright the Word of God would defeat Satan anywhere any place any time in any form so you can only see when you start recognizing that you are the Word of God then the Bride of Christ would defeat Satan anywhere any place any time under any condition because she's already been written in heaven as the victorious church now Satan make them get scared make them that bat for them before the world ever began God called your name you were Christians and wrote in the Lamb's Book of Life before the world ever started that's God's Word he spoke it back there and revealed it through his servants now what is you soul brother Wayne what's actually going on now but the RAM says it like this then your name was put in the Lamb's Book of Life God spoke the word it was in his thinking and in his thought he spoke the word and everything happened at that time this is just God's seed materializing and then this is his seed materializing his word is coming down the line of God is flashing across quickly and the cedar recognizes it because it's born of God it's Abraham's seed is four-note by God that's why the light flashes it's to catch the sea do you see that he actually now is materializing something that he saw before the world's ever began amen to think of this that God ordains you and called you before the foundation of the world see but it never happened until 4000 years later that's right you see then this is where Joel here's the question in job 38 hey man he's asked my god job where were you before the foundations of the world amen 11:00 don't you amen and when the sons of God shouted for joy amen I don't think there's a mistake in the scripture I don't think it said Sun some accident I don't think that it meant to say service and accidentally sent sons but it said where were you with the sons of God was shouting for joy I tell you this not just a servant anymore but there's somebody coming to sonship and God already solid before the world ever began the prophet of God said what was they shouting about he said they were shouting because they realized that lamb had been being slain for them and they were coming to perfection back there in the mind of God do you see a menu already shouting in the mind of God that's why we're shouting here because we're shouting there we're only doing now what God saw back man he's just materialized him the mind of God amen he's solid breakdown he saw the revelation strike your life and there you shouted amen it asked you where were you before the foundation of the world well I tell you something tonight I read this morning I believe we had to answer I believe we have to tension we were fed we were in the mind of God amen until the seventh angel come we did not have that answer but tonight but this morning by the grace of God were able to know the answer that was here from job was hid from the prophets but has been revealed to you that before there was anything God already had a church I was gonna tell the Saints and he was going to take over because their names were written on the Lamb's Book of Life o Lord of God you similarly what are you so excited about I tell you sometimes Amen I think about the grace of God and what he does to get us where we are what a powerful thing you know I was just watching brother Ronald Spitzer preached last night I knew where I was going this morning and I kept thinking Lord how's that going to tie together how you gonna put that together and write on the end of the service you remember him he starts preaching about restoration take it back and and what do you do he said y'all make yourself the list but all you stuff on the list make that listing and you put it down what you you know what you put on that list things that was important to you and then people that are important to you he meant you made it lives right what's you highly went back there hey man he's got a beguiling brought her back down heck man I guarantee you had Miguel son brother Tasha's list hey man hey man and when he brought sister Abigail up here hey man what'd she do she started shouting she started to rejoicing why because she was on the list and then she was being restored back hey man she wasn't shy to come she was emotional she was shot because she was coming back she didn't become a daughter itas minute she was a dog sitting back there but but something called a servant women she was [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] a possessive victory devil can never take away from me you can never repossess that I'll tell you hey man we were talking in the back room how Josh was feeling brother Ron said well Josh he said I bet you were feeling a bit like David when Abigail was returned josh says you mention it and I was thinking but hey man or maybe Tim but Jim said I don't remember but brother and sister Abigail might have been thinking the same thing can you imagine Abigail on the camp for that bunch of malachite down there not this one that one in the Bible hey many of that Amalekites took that child that world from her husband and had her down there in that place don't you know when David's army started rising over that hill [Applause] it's ungodly talents and you put you on that list before you ever left Hammond he already had you on that list and this message is coming into the earth to call them o sons and daughters have got a land by the Spirit of God is that right it's a lady sitting little brother manage meetings there's a woman sitting there with a little sick baby and she's standing there and brother man said a woman sitting on a men and shears saw the prayer card saw the baby saw the sickness and something coming her heart I need to go pray for that child I need to give that woman my seat and all of a sudden something else said to her yeah but she's got a prayer card brother bands gonna pray for and this is gonna happen in this gonna happen and while she was sitting there thinking that out after a while kept coming so she just got up and went over there and said to the lady I got a burden I can't get away from can I pray for you can I pray for the baby and the woman says sure go ahead she pray for the baby pray for the woman she said here sit in my seat and she left and went up in the balcony amen so she didn't even have the seat she was supposed to have according to wouldn't she come in the house but she went I'm sit in the balcony and when the prayer line come the little woman come in the prayer line with the baby and the prophet under inspiration looked at the baby and said listen amen there's nothing wrong with the baby that baby was sequence she come in but that woman sent them the can you write their kind of leadership to pray for the child and she's already healed is that right sister Charlotte oh hey man I wasn't finding that when God laid it on your heart come and pray for the girl fee halter and you said all know let this one pray let this would pray and some said but I give you your children hey man you go pray for somebody else's children and she come out of there have the seat back there and coming later hands and we saw the power of God listen church we are not just a bunch of preachers in the pulpit with an anointing but there's an anointing on every son and daughter of God that's an anointing there because you're on the list of God we are not be seen by this intellectual spirit that says you got to shut up and sit down and take whatever the devil has but I'm on the list of God everything or overcomers of this lab to see an age I thought we wasn't social shock because we got power no we're shouting because I named us on the list but everybody has got a power over the devil every devil is subject ever powder subject ain't no but it's not just any subject yes he can't get away from you miss said preacher Amen are you sure about this there's only one that had pre creation knowledge and that was the one that met Abraham told him what his name was told him what his promises was and his name was Melchizedek he knew his name didn't he Abraham Melchizedek knew its name do y'all know the Bible said in Matthew the first chapter that Jesus was both the son of David and the son of Abraham and it was the only two men in the Bible that spoken of Qasr dick was both Abraham and David and he was attributed to be the son of both of him that's why amen that brother Ram Sedna Cassidy became Jesus Christ who is the son of David who is the son of Abraham and then he is Melchizedek amen he is the word he is the all-knowing God and Jesus stood in John 17 and said I had acknowledged before the world ever began and he actually included his disciples in his free creation knowledge and let them know that God gave me you before the world ever began and was so powerful that he challenged the devil and said that the devil Peter wants to sift you as sand but don't you worry I've already pray for you and that's a powerful point in my heart that God's already prayed but they will desire to deceive you but don't worry I already played for you now Lord when did you pray for me before the foundation of the world he spoke your name in victory now the prophet of God said see this is where the book of life comes into view is used to smoke a sermon because that same Jesus Christ amen returns in the form of the Holy Ghost in the last days and actually visits this generation in a name-calling but the bride of Jesus Christ who has their remains on that lands book of life see Jesus had that pre creation knowledge y'all recognize that we have Branham didn't even have one a seventh grade education and he's telling you what happened before the world ever began he's telling you about your names and how that was written he was said Amen a man without a seventh grade education said come and go with me and let's stand on the banisters of time right into eternity and said see what it was there was nothing there wasn't even a god he said he was hello healed self-existent one he said that because there was nothing to rejoice or nothing to worship he said he wasn't even God at that time he said it was a great all of a sudden he said a great fountain of a rainbow began to spew up out of eternity he said then that rainbow was formed to a theophany and how did that feed off and he beginning to create and he said that was the earth and the Sun the moons you see what he's doing he's taking you back I'm telling you before the earth before the Sun before all these things there you were all the way back there in that great rainbow back there God favored you back there that's why he favors you up here do you imagine that great pre creation knowledge coming to us hey man and the theologians saying this one way and the doctors say it's another way and here's a little prophet saying this is the way it happened your schools tried to teach you that you come from an ape or you're from some Big Bang or you come from some situation and I'm always wondering how they know so much because none of them was there just to be honest I never was there just like a guy told me here while back he said well Alain brother branham missed it on that that boy being raised from dead over in Finland he told me how brother battle didn't have all that right and all that man was maybe in his mid-50s I don't know after he told me about that a while look right at him I said well hey man well how did he go then he said what do you mean I said well of course you must have been there and have all this obvious of what happened he said well you know I wasn't there I said well then pound the tarnation do you know what happened now the hillbilly if you wasn't there you probably don't know what happened but why don't you hear the guy that was there they meant william branham wasn't there but Jesus Christ was there and fact Jesus is a spirit that took over a man's body and pronounced in this age but that was a pride back there before the world ever began and he's coming to this age you see what brother Ram did he said well that that cameras Hornsby 42 inches he said he said that they'll be a grizzly bear they'll be a boy in a green check her church he said oh and then the place he said will cost couple screams want to be mighty want to be clear who catch fish the first two days won't catch the Lord then we'll catch this little bit now you say why would he do that why would he do that to let you know but he knew what he was talking about he was telling them things that happened before because he was showing them that the same God that's telling you about these fish and he's counting these bear is the same God that's telling me what was going on back back before the foundations of the world that there actually was a people there now do you see God actually ordained some unto eternal life amen to Biotest that he actually prayed he actually prayed for Peter that he would not a man be sitting as saying of course we know a man that Peter did fail greatly amen but the failure of Peters life did not become the identification of Peters life after Peter fell the Lord three times he actually became the spokesman of the day of Pentecost and is reported to opening the door in acts the second chapter to the by baptism of the Holy Ghost the man that had that lets failure became a man who was key in the scripture that carried the keys of the kingdom of God binding and loosing amen that was a reason why because God knew the devil was going to throw everything he had at Peter he knew because of Peters position in the church everything the devil honey was going to throw at Peter remember that God also me that before Peter failed before Peter had problems he knew that God already ordained him before the world to begin to stand where he was going to stand admit that wasn't enough Devils you think about this it meant sometimes you look around you see the devil folks everything he's got I know this for sure brother Tim devil throw everything he's got into church he's through everything he's gotta chew through everything he's got to chew he's through everything he got him have you ever been through anything the devil folks everything he's got at you don't meet anybody wasn't there now see whatever the devil through that she wasn't enough and if it was everything that he had then it tells me the devil just don't have enough the devil didn't have a enough to keep Peter from being the spokesman on the day of Pentecost amen that makes me believe that the devil don't have enough to keep this bride from standing in her position in the last days buried enough Devils in hell to keep this pot out of her adoption fair enough powers give the hell but keep this church from fulfilling what God and state were doing this last things no sir not enough tell somebody there ain't enough no sir you know what before the world began where were you the sons of God that was shouting for joy that doesn't say servants that doesn't say angels because you know what we've had a prophet among us who said you were never an angel you were never an angel and you will never be an angel but you always were a son and that's why you are a son then you've got to quit thinking then adoption means you're an angel amen that you're an angel an angel an angel you see how the devil is trying to twist up the idea of the Church of the Living God to put this way out on the future somewhere but this is not a future event this is a part of the Bride of Christ in the last days my often say it like this devil got everybody in his place nobody's arguing that are their Sodom's in their place homosexuals are in their place denomination is in their place and the devil's got power to put all of them in their place then you're telling me God don't have the power to put this bride in the place she belongs in not one I tell you as a bunch of people gotta hold this message and twist it enough to put adoption somewheres out in the future when God give it with the Holy Ghost to bring the church in authority come on Church that take us back to the mind of God before the world began I'm not trying to get into doctrine I'm trying to get into a place to say the devil has tried to put this away from you and God has brought it to you but say there ain't enough Devils to keep the church no sir not enough I'll tell you this the scripture said for we know that all things work together for the good of them that love God to them that are called that says they called according to his purpose for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren for moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called been he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified that's right amen then for the children not yet being born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to the election might stand not of works but of him that calleth before I formed thee in the belly Jeremiah said even before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee and I ordained me to be a prophet of the nations before he was ever even born can you imagine that everything God does is pre-planned now I think it's amazing when you start talking about the pre plans of God because I'm I'm gonna forgetful fella I used to not be so much but it's getting worse all the time I forget things there's probably people mad at me right now but I don't why it's the truth I've had people if anybody's watching here in you're upset at me forgive me okay I forgot I have you know sometimes do you see God actually pre plans but knowledge now his knowledge it's an infant no jar knowledge is a finite knowledge okay to find that knowledge but even in finite knowledge there is pre-planning you think about the knowledge of a man wants to build a house he builds it for certain size he now we got Planning Commission's and they think about the things we don't think about you know the road and CERN they think it's a pre-planning it's a it's an infinite mind amen in God but in man it's a finite mind but look at how far they're moving towards planning knowing that it makes a difference to plan before something happens see before the rain comes let's get the right culvert before the problem let's get the right amount of sewage before you get get everything planned out good because it's a pre plan of God now now I just took a little a little maybe a little example today to prove that there is pre-planning now to be honest with you I pre planned the meeting in the back room I was sitting there thinking about this and I thought I thought isn't it amazing that man can do this if man can do it why can't God do it you think about a brother brother Luke Pruett will yet with Luke he just walked out of the room he's just up top can you come here minion brother Luke I don't know brother Tim could you had something maybe you could just come right with him brother look you see there's a there's a there's actually a way to pre-plan something in a fine mind but there's like I just called Luke Pruitt by name I just called Tim winters by name but the only reason I could do that's because I knew them before this so if I didn't know him before the sermon I could never say to them look her to improve our team winners I couldn't call their name because I would have no knowledge of them now another thing I had to know is if I call them they'd actually come because there's something huge that don't know now the other thing is I knew they'd had to come and another thing I knew is I knew they'd have to know I'm wasn't bringing them up here to embarrass some say got your name on forget your name on a man god bless you you see they would have to know the reason I brought him there was for a purpose other than to embarrass them or to hurt them but they were answering a call because I asked them by name and they knew my nature in my calling he's not gonna shoot this he's nothing part us he's not what embarrasses he must have something in mind it's gonna be a blessing to our lives or he never would cause but because of their knowledge of me and my knowledge of them they came into the call and now they're an example to the rest of the combination of my knowledge of him there's somebody in the spirit against them do I know them of course I know him you saw me call them my name amen and God has called you and made you an example of his full knowledge of before the world began that he put you on your god bless you then he put you on the list amen and then he in this age would call your name because he's proving by that calling that he actually knew you before him is that right hey man there's one more I want to call here hey sister I was thinking can you come hey man I tell you what this lady right here puts in enough prayer amen she prays for me all the times you know you can feel people's prayers if y'all know that amen and this lady god bless her sister Barbara Amen how many loves sister Barbara god bless you see this couldn't happen if we didn't know one another they meant you didn't know I was gonna do this did you ain't meant but you know now cuz I brought you in when I called you he meant now she's an example that I didn't normally just call what I didn't just call too but I could call three male or female and make an example of something I wanted to you all to see god bless you says amen there's a scripture in there for you do you see God actually plans things and writes them out and then at a certain time he will actually show a favor to a certain name by the calling of that name now God in this age has actually favored the Church of the Living God and meant to call you by name and to bring you in a great plan plan of God and in this plan you're not destroyed in this plan you are not in Paris in this plan you're not you're not defeated you're not lukewarm amen but jesus said you should be rejoicing in the plan of God when you heard your name you would rejoice knowing that God called you by name I'll tell you something today I believe this is the hour of the favor of God upon the church and I believe this is me and you can rejoice I believe this is the time I believe this is the hour where God is let the church feel what it is to be called therefore we are pre-planned of God it's all pre plan but gene of God you see there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's life only one form and that's God then that was there to be a son of God you had to always be in him a gene of his life you saw brother Wayne I don't remember it does that matter does that mean you're not there if you don't remember it you got to be careful because hey man I don't remember my mama hey man what day I was born in the howl of the day and I don't remember what the weather was like I don't even remember getting my first diaper changed or my bottles I don't but my mother does my mother can tell you the whole story because she was actually there amen and when I begin to get a little older she begin to tell me stories about things that happen to me when I was a child and she began to bring me in her understanding of what I was when I don't even remember and God before you remember before you do anything about it you were already in him but this word is actually bringing out the manifestation of what you were in God before the world began come on you saw brother Wayne did you exist before you were born sure I existed before I was born you say how did you exist that's my father come on there was a little boy run around with my dad I was in him I was in my father until I was expressed in this age and I was in God until I was expressed in this age but this expression has come come on amen if you take a grain of corn and you bring forth the seat from that what is it if you bring a cat and it has a cat it has a baby what is it if you have a dog and it has a baby what is it if God has a child then what is that child but child as a child of the Most High God with the very attributes but Almighty God is still the church right now supreme power supreme authority there ain't no damage no power very nothing that can revoke that child you see my name what's on the Lamb's Book of Life I was a part of you before before you said are you sure brother Branham said Amen that when you heard this message when you heard this message you recognized it as legal food he said say you heard from your theophany before you were ever left the eagle's nest that little baby eagle remember something with mama was brought down to the chicken yard but one day the Eagle came out Amen of the nest with an expression and begin to scream like an eagle give me just a little bit alarm scream like an eagle you see when that Eagle begin to scream he didn't sound like no chicken hello church you'll never get a bride call to this our preacher no denominational message you'll never do it hide the truth from them if there's an eagle in them they was eagle to begin with and they're sitting there wondering right now why am i different than this bunch of chickens up in with Amen there's something there that is hungry and thirsting for the world of quarter back to the blind but sender aids let the holy ghost begin the car if there's a scene of lie down on the inside of you you won't fall a platinum chicken you will begin to rise but Anika that's an authority that begins to come into you oh I'll tell you and that Eagle begin the screen but can you imagine when it's pretty straight wings and begin to fly over that not forgive me but I believe the son must have been rising the son must have been coming up amen and that Eagle begin to foul amen it's the land of the rising of the Sun in that land of the rising of the Sun that was a couple chickens amen a couple eagles over there in a bunch of chickens hey the Eagle come back and the Eagle tongue bath epic in the fowl of Japan can you hear it can you hear it Japan the eagle is calling you you'll see often he is calling you Oh Lolita god that's right the Sun is up the Sun of righteousness has arisen the eagle is flew out brother he wasn't a son but they you heard that eagle you wasn't a son these preachers come over there and started preaching they didn't make you a son you was already an eagle he was already a son this message only told you you don't have to live in that chicken barn you don't have to live under traditions and ideas of and spread your wings eagle you can fly you can fly higher than any other bird well I feel that wind can I feel that wind coming again home the day of Pentecost there was a rushing wind and when they come out of the upper room the revelation had struck them the revelation had come to them and they actually were staggering under the influence of the revelation that they had recreates and knowledge that they come from God somebody said y'all drunk with the wine no not like you think no not like you think you bunch of preachers act like a drunk people but not like you think you see we're not drinking Jack Daniels and brandy and all these things you see the wine that we're drinking comes from the grapes of Canaan that come from the land of promise and a prophet went over and brought a revelation back and then it's been squeezed down into a ministry that is preaching a divine revelation but the power of God and when you start drinking the bar amen it'll bring something in you I was telling the church shell - and you get a bunch of drunks together and the decibels of the other of the room changes they're sitting right right next to one another and they start hollering they're offering back and forth Amen because they're losing their ability of senses their senses start losing listen when you get drunk enough Amen you lose that ability and say oh that's just too much that's just too much left that's too much this and that's too much oh I'll tell you what we need we need the pastor of the stimulation of Revelation they have a child and daughter of God get so trip from the presence of pain to drink you are already sons take the trait your name what's written on the lens but come on take the train ain't no ain't no pound Mary I got on my choice shoes I got on my John Cena's Halloween you see these come on shoes these are these are gravity less shoes I can walk in the outer space and these shoes come on the astronaut power is lifting the church above the gravity but Laodicea and the age of the time and the people she's being blasted out but the power of the Holy Ghost but a power of God that's what's wrong in this in town that's what's wrong with all these dead churches they took the fire I've gone off for the altar and they're trying to get the people under a bad idea man but you let the fire of God come in the church lock the church on fire and watch it burn the Holy Ghost begins to move think about a fire brothers it catches think about a fires it catches you ever seen a fire kids brother Timothy Amen you let a fire start burning and let her win start blowing at the same time I feel the fire on the anvil of the holy ghost burning in the church I hear are we uncommon twice they put this fire out he's a pain in the flames of the place [Applause] [Applause] before the foundations of the world new countries answer the fire of God came upon them and made an answer that could not be refuted when the fire of God begins to learn oh yeah I'm absolutely sure but many men are inviting people to altars and they're saying we don't believe in all these you know why they don't because they got no fire on the altar and their altars are useless and they're ineffective and then they don't preach enough of the gospel to even call somebody to an altar and if they happen to get somebody hungry enough that wants to come there's nothing there to satisfy so why have an altar why have a service like that but if you've got some preachers but a fireboard son of God Amen that believes on the Holy Ghost please some powdered peanut balls until hearts will play and say I want some of that how about some of that had a little boy come to Braille I'm one day but early on from over North Carolina and sisters here look what coming to prey on brother Brad you were there we've down in Tennessee comes he separately he said I want some of that my daddy's got I said now that's a Christian if your kids want what you got that's a Christian atmosphere that's a Holy Ghost fine I know the world has produced such a religion kids don't walk back but you let a mom and daddy get on fire with the Holy Ghost and them children desire amen they desire that kind of life they desire that kind of Holy Ghost Oh remember where thou has come from remember when you were instead and sins and trespasses and all you have is a form of religion that God came in by the Holy Ghost and filled you in st. about you then why wouldn't you want others to get the same thing God give you you know I was a boy hey man I was able to tell that boy it's lucky for you that Apostle Peter said this promise his son to you and that's Linnaeus oh Lord I got your car and we watch the Holy Ghost come down in that meeting and feel a little more you don't have to be [Applause] [Applause] [Music] Sandin the flame I see that I see that brother man said the Rising Sun said you know he said the thing about it is there's a mechanics and dynamics and he explains that a couple of ways the eagle in the chickens then he comes to the car remember he said have a perfect car full of gasoline he said perfect everything's in its ordered he said but without a fire he said that Carlos said steal there's no moving in it you ain't going the worst-hit steel is setting there he said now if it's that way you would be better off with water it's gasoline that's right but what's when the fire comes its what proves if it's gasoline you put the fire on that you see if it burns ain't maybe you take a bunch of this Inlet you'll teach you we're getting down the churches Amen you can put the fire the Holy Ghost the engines fizzle out it'll fizzle out to nothing else and only then throw against it and resent in their spirits and set down and lock up on you amen but if it's a teaching of this message with power and you begin to preach the fire of God it's like a bonfire you poured a bunch of guys up and all the sudden lights up and it begins to burn amen and then Timothy gets up behind the preacher with a gas can oh we might as well kick that old Bibble while we're here he's working for God's filling station and they're not certain water down there they're passing out dance clams and he stands up here and bounces that far because he knows he knows it for fire of God starts burning but odds are gonna change hearts are going to change we can't change it but got to change it the Holy Ghost in the church until the such a fire begins to rise up in you that you can feel the glories of the embers of the Holy Ghost amen you know what happens under that all the stuff of that fire starts burning like that Amen things start dying amen unbelief starts dying spirits start dying fading scotland's and their power over you you begin to feel the unction of the Holy Ghost that Eagle anointing starts rising up in you you begin to say I can I can believe for this I can trust this I can do this I can do all things right you know you know this is the age right now when the Prophet actually said God open that book and started calling the names off of that Lamb's Book of Life you don't know what that really means to us that means there's millions of names probably on that book would you agree that's probably millions of names and all the way from Adam all the way up to how they those things are in that book but this is the first people who knew their name was in that book nobody else ever saw their name in that book but in the last days God but bring a message that would put your name he would reach your name to you in the message of the hour and it would call you it would call you to retention you see what he was doing he was calling you back to what he saw you ask before you wasn't always a slave in Egypt you mustn't always a slave down there before you were there you're Abraham's son but what slowly sure initial Egypt you're nothing different than Israel region Amen but the minute that message came and called him out and started taking him over it took them over but they hit that red see brother hit that red see last night and they come and hit that red sing right but God did not let the Red Sea stop them right but by the power of the spoken word he opened up the Red Sea and they walked across dry-rot is that right now I want you to look at the power of that believe in church do you know how much power you have you actually control the Seas your type is the moon right but moon the tide starts coming in on the earth but then said the moon turns and faces the tide and it has to slip away the tide has to reverse its order when the bride looks at it the moon brother Ben said see as long as the bride's on the earth he said see the tribulation can't take place because the enemy's trying to come in like a flood but there's a bride standing there saying I got family not yet devil I got children not yet devil you see it you watch it but I will start coming in and it looks like our young people is going to be swallowed it looks like the revival is going to be over but all of a sudden and Elmer somewheres begins to pray and they say God you promised us our children you promised us a revival for our children and they turn and look at that devil devil let's not be alone in a God get back to your banks I think it's time for you to turn the tide on the devil I think it's time for you to turn the tide in your home it's time for you to say devil that's as far as you're going in my house of God you are not servants your sons and daughters of God Israel has sons is the last daughters in fact when you go what's the top of the scripture Miriam and and all the Israelites to me them cross that Red Sea you know that tide could not come in on them as long as Israel was in that trench now water can move on it had to stand up and actually defy gravity holding this place but the minute that Israel got out of that trench the minute that bride got out of that that's what happened all of a sudden the waters started flowing in and the whole thing was destroyed one of these things this Brides going to leave this earth and the waters of judgments going to spread across it you think about this in a type the prophet of God said it like this he said we're marrying them gotta cross they look back in that red sea and actually saw their enemies in the lottery but them said which was a type of the blood of Jesus Christ it's a powerful thing gunney tambourines in here this morning amen now I want you to think of this right here because I was studying this the other day and I realized that there was actually about 2 million people crossed that Red Sea do you mean into them do you know what actually happened when they got across that I mean you can use it you know what actually happen they got across it when they got across that sea they turned around and looked and when they look they saw their enemy was dead now yeah we might have we might have 200

heard two hundred what did it sound like pull the weights of that red seat twenty six hundred thousand women the dental exhaust they begin to place God through miles away but miles away they can see that the storm rising off of that sanctuary they can hear the roar of the Holy Ghost power that's it loop down the banks of that well the leader of the bunch Moses he stood saying like y'all clap that down I got a different Bible my Bible said Moses stood up and begin to sing in the spirit bin y'all know in the Bible in the Book of Revelations it says that in the day amen in the great overcoming in heaven they will actually sing the same song in heaven that they sail the banks of the river down there within the Red Sea Moses wrote a song on the Red Sea that's gonna be Sun up in heaven one of these things another little thing about that it's the first song they wrote in the Bible before David Moses wrote this song of the overcoming and historians to believe it's the first song actually ever written then I could say it was contemporary sorry it's in the Bible and they sung a new song you know like a headlight that song Chris nobody ever saw a bunch of Pharaoh is Egypt down in the middle bottom of a scene [Applause] [Applause] I'll tell you what a prophet of God said he said it's actually time to worship he said do you see when that book is open it is the time to worship this is the time when the elders worship this is the time with the rapini worship this is a time when everybody worships not just the preachers not just the Deacons not just the trustees but this is when the young people the elders the mothers the wives the husbands it's when every it's when everybody begins to say worthy is the lamb you said brother Wayne I think all this stuff y'all talking abouts a little out of water let me read the profit I've seen jumping spells and joy spells but that wasn't nobody hurt mountains run out and the Sun went down and everything still took place nobody was hurt I've seen meetings where the power of God was revealed to the people that they were free from the world and the things of the world and the joy of the Lord filled the congregation they stood and screamed and cried and shouted to the top of their voice for the glory of God I never did see anything disorderly I see them shout I've seen them scream I sing them look I see them dance but I ain't see nothing disorderly I've seen the house of God a fire with Holy Ghost warship this weekend but we sing now the water misses the outlet for it this is the time to worship books often how can she hold her peace God call her name he spoke my name but for the world before heaven I've heard my name it was cold I never seen anything disorderly it's right in order because that they recognized that their name has been written in the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundation of the world it's not out of order it's in order because they saw that their names was written in the Lamb's Book of Life now don't you leave this meeting of them critics it's out there on their ways don't y'all watch this and so well that's just a bunch of emotion but your workup and they're just trying to work all them people up and all that I want to tell everybody listening everybody watch it he meant that what this is is in order because when God revealed the names of this church Jesus said in the Bible that

crazy I'm free free and free from the fear of man I'm free from the fear of denominations and creeds and reputation you don't like keep people from worshipping they're afraid of what somebody's going to think about when I tell you this ah quit worrying what the world thought and started thinking about what God thought and God sent you the virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ and brother when I heard him say you've never done it in the first place rose up in me and I begin to say glory to God I'm free I'm free for my parents I greet them against - and three from every part of the world go

that at this time stand up Jordan have little Jordan through it here that wants to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he is repented of his sins he's asked the Lord to come into his heart amen to be as Savior and so we're so thankful for that that start that he's made with the Lord and he wants to take on his name and he said you know I asked him I said what do you what do you want to be baptized for he said because I want to have the Holy Ghost and I want to go in the rapture and then well the promise is under you it's all your children is for them that are far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call and we remember the very promise that was given there when Peter gave us the eternal prescription they asked what must we do and when they asked him you know how do we receive this Holy Ghost what should we do and these any answer the question repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so this is our promise for us and our children and for those that are far off right down to the last age amen I believe that God will have those that are filled with His Holy Spirit this is what has promised us in this last day so we're thankful to God that we can testify that he he's still God he's still saving mercy is still open grace is still provided for us amen and so we're here today to proclaim the Word of God now remember there was nobody ever baptized in the Bible except in the name of Jesus Christ amen you're gonna look through all the Bible and every time when they went and applied what Jesus said they knew who the who Jesus was that he was a manifestation of the father's word and we are here today to testify it to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ because he said whatever you do in word or deed do it all in the name of Jesus Christ amen so we baptized in his name amen because there we are identified with him and man we're following exactly what they did in the days of the Apostles because down to the ages the denominational world took and it with Tudor lien and change the baptism of from then from into from the name of Jesus Christ down into Father Son and Holy Ghost which is not a name in his titles he is certainly father he's everlasting father a man of course he was manifested in his sonship as a very human purpose to to pay the price of redemption and he is the Holy Ghost amen because there is one Lord one faith one baptism one God and Father of us all so today we're going to obey the Lord today in baptized Jordan in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Jordan the Lord Jesus sent me an ordained me to preach the gospel into all the world and baptize those that believe in the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost and so therefore in obedience to that divine command i baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ thank you Jesus thank you Oh Rosalie [Music] Hey [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hey man while we have just seen heaven come down and bless a service after service after service we're so thankful to the Lord for what he has done for us and then we started out with the word being ministered about the conflict between God and Satan and realize this is not our battle it's God's battle Amen that he's a leader here in this last day leading us to victory Amen we know already he's the victor because he overcome death hell in the gray a man you say well brother Tim weren't you afraid of Hell no because he went there for me Amen he's already overcome it and I'm more than a victorious one through Christ amen what a privilege we have today knowing that a man and then we heard we heard that we were armed and dangerous and I'll just tell you just for the record if you think this is just all thunder and no lightning we've had lightning with our thunder amen is this not a bunch of noise well we seen demons cast out just stick that been healed come on touch walk a man we know the power of our garden and we have seen solos delivered a man and we've seen those baptized taking on the name of Jesus Christ so it's not just all all the thunder and no lightning Amen there's a power of God unto salvation it brings deliverance and then how many can testify right in this building you've been healed delivered set free and a man liberated Alleluia hey man we we have heard the word accept your your Liberty because we have received our Liberty in this day an hour a man and we heard a glorious sermon on house house Israel no sons and I say yes Israel has some sons some mighty warriors that are rising up in this last day an invincible army hallelujah now we are the sons of God a man so therefore since we are sons take it back I'm just going to say don't stop pursuing when you leave this meeting you can take every progress claim your inheritance now the land is open the book is unsealed the mysteries are revealed don't take your land now stand fast therefore in the Liberty wherein Christ hath made you free Alleluia and then rejoice not just because we're noisemakers and we get happy and whatever but because our names are written in heaven hallelujah amen we have seen our name in the Lamb's Book of Life and that's why we're rejoicing amen my just mighty mighty mighty things that God has spoke to us and we want to thank you all for coming and just being with us this weekend and from Wednesday through Sunday we just had that glorious time together I didn't get to shake your hand or speak to you I will be available after the service we won't slip right out will I've done that on the on the nights to try to get get back and try to get prepared for the next day and so on but we won't be doing that at the end of the service I'll be happy to speak to you shake your hand hug your neck if you're man and man your sister I'll give you a a hug with a handshake amen so god bless you we're so happy to be together with God's people and it's great when we get together and we appreciate all the different churches that has come and shared this moment with us we had different ones from all I I saw from all kinds of states all the way far north is Connecticut on the American side Canada and all the way down and start south is you can get down in Florida and so you know and then then Texas and Mississippi and Missouri and I go to go to name and I'm gonna miss somebody cuz we know all the Arkansas you know was here because it's all the part of Louisiana Purchase anyhow so a man and so you know I'm that that that includes a whole bunch of you that are from Louisiana it goes all the way from from from the Gulf of Mexico all the way up in the Canada that's all Louisiana so we might have divided you up and put you in a few other states and let's you call yourself something else but that's okay you're Louisiana and we're happy that you were here and man and being a part and my brother Donny Reagan sent his greetings he wished he could have been here we had some represent representatives from his his church that would have been here and I won't call all their names but we're happy that you came to be with us of course we were delighted to have all our representatives from Japan to be with us amen hallelujah I want to say I really appreciate the ministry that we have had this week amen what a blessing you know sometimes we're human so you know sometimes we hear another preach and we say oh what am I going to preach after that but you know if we just remember this is not a competition amen so we don't have to compete we just relax and let God use us for his glory a man I'll just tell you this you know I preached around the world I've never been intimidated by anybody amens I'm not gonna start anything now I heard and or later you know well I'm going to stand right there in the gift and the calling that God gave me Amen cuz nobody can preach like I can you can take that any way you want to [Music] amen praise the Lord is so good to be together as we said and I would just want to thank evening like Tabernacle for hosting families and providing food and a lunch sacks or and after service snacks there that they passed out and and you know the meals that were providing the hospitality that was given even a night Tabernacle you made me proud god bless you I think it was brother wrong that said that you know you have indication of a call of God as God places men around the ministry that God sins and I'll just tell you I couldn't do what we do without the the the help the Deacons trustees the musicians the sound technicians all of them and their part and you in every one and every member here of this church you're a very very important and I'll tell you what if you just realize you've got a job to do you'd never let your seat sit empty but you'd be here every service pulling on the gift of God doing what you could to further this gospel and man I just saw a man raised his hand just a moment ago both hands to the Lord as I said that and and that's my cousin there Victor Middleton he has come back to the Lord he's one of the sons that have returned oh yeah and I'm just gonna make his apology public he said brother Tim I come down here to apologize for not coming to church for the past 20 years and I'll tell you what I figure it takes a man to come up somebody that's really repented to make that kind of apology so I want to be right and with this God's gonna heal his family and you'll turn right back around and look there you'll see as young as daughter go to run and do his arms and I'll tell you what is because a pratical is come home [Applause] I say let's kill the fatted calf let's have a party let's have a celebration but I did not just one miss Kevin ho that's many more than you comin home hello you say brother Tim why did you build such a big church so every prodigal would have a seat we're not hallelujah and if you can squeeze under icy tree just come on it's big enough for all amen god bless you it's been good to be together with you and have this time of fellowship one with another and you know as as I said the many ones that have come yet got brother Jason Jackson that left his home and his Pope Evan and he's a pastor he's coming that's a big sacrifice to do that and come be a part of the service appreciate that and very very much and then we have other representations brother Joshua goth came for had to go back home this morning but he was here for all the others and so and yet he he left representation to be with us this morning and we appreciate that a little group down in Warren and what God is doing there thank God for that I'm glad that there are there is a light in every in every community I've never never believed in just having one mega church and everybody goes to that but I believe that God wants a light in every community so they're there for we try to encourage and help and strengthen and whatever we can and we we have given tens of thousands of dollars you know just right right here in the United States to help other churches build churches God not only provided ours debt-free but he also has provided where that we can help others and we have done it amen and we're thankful because we believe that God has a bride around the world and that's why we went to Japan is because we we had a burden in our hearts there was a burning desire to see somebody else saved a man to get this glorious message in their heart and so you know that's our desire and to choose so that the end can come because this gospel must be preached into all the world and then shall the income so therefore how will they hear without a preacher and how can they preach unless they be sent a man so we're earth who we're thankful to God for His grace to us amen less of our hips together Lord Jesus service after service what can we say you have met with us supernaturally your your presence has been felt it's been seen it's been witness lord we sing spirits that had the bow to the name of Jesus we saw those who were lost saved and those that needed filling filled we saw so many

neighboring state of Texas or over in Tennessee whether it be way up in Connecticut or over in Canada whether it be way down in Florida or wherever it is Georgia Alabama God so many other places that have been represented here we just thank you for every one of them Lord and we just ask now that you'd bless your little bride everywhere let him see father that there is a balm in Gilead if there is

today may they long remember even in the times of weariness when in the midst of trials may they just think back Lord and remember Lord is the psalmist David would say when I remember that faithfulness maybe remember these meetings where the Holy Spirit came and they are dealt with harps and brought deliverance may this be a milestone for many of them they'll be able to look at this marker and point back to it it was that day that day I was different that day I was delivered that day I was free Lord we love you and we thank you for your many blessings as we go may your Holy
