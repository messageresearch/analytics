[42:52] and we know we know there's dangers
[42:56] we know there's a devil going to the
[42:59] land

[43:04] put a squeeze on
[43:05] on churches or meetings just like this
[43:09] with some of you that are here today i
[43:11] understand hadn't been in church for two
[43:13] years because of it
[43:15] fear drives a lot of things
[43:19] but we're not afraid
[43:22] we were told be not
[43:24] afraid the words out of jesus mouth was
[43:28] fear not
[43:31] that's his words to us tonight
[43:33] we're not going to fear we're going to
[43:34] believe
[43:36] a man a couple of months ago some of you
[43:39] then some of you that came and some of
[43:41] your hearts were here with us
[43:43] as um we had a memorial service for
[43:45] sister karen
[43:47] and we had 500 people gathered from 14
[43:50] different states in canada
[43:52] not one incident of kogit
[43:54] came out of that
[43:56] so we're believing the same thing for
[43:57] this meeting

[54:04] your mercy would be upon us be upon this
[54:06] assembly upon each and every person
[54:08] father lord you have said that we're
[54:12] that where two or three are gathered in
[54:14] your name that you would be in the midst
[54:15] of them
[54:16] the lord jesus we invite you tonight we
[54:19] ask you for your holy spirit to come and
[54:21] take this meeting lord
[54:23] use it for your glory father let the
[54:25] anointing of the lord come upon your
[54:27] word and father that it would move in a
[54:29] special way
[54:31] lord we invite you to the platform
[54:33] tonight before these people before
[54:35] everyone we admit our inabilities lord
[54:38] our inability to say or do anything lord
[54:41] but if you would just come by
[54:43] there'd be such a special thing done in
[54:45] these meetings lord
[54:46] we're inviting you tonight throughout
[54:48] these meetings but father right now
[54:51] while these believers had their hands
[54:53] laid one on the other
[54:54] we pray father that every spirit unlike
[54:57] you would be bound in this building
[54:59] right now
[55:00] lord by the authority
[55:02] of the bride of jesus christ
[55:05] we bind satan on every hand that he'd
[55:09] not be able to lift his head that he'd
[55:10] not been able to do one thing to hinder
[55:13] but father tonight in the name of jesus
[55:16] may the grace of god move over this
[55:18] meeting
[55:19] taking hearts and lives lord bringing
[55:21] such a freedom to your people father now
[55:24] lord we commit this meeting in thy
[55:26] faithful hands
[55:28] in the name of jesus we pray
[55:31] amen
[55:32] and amen god bless you tonight amen if
[55:36] you have your bibles we would like to
[55:38] look into the word of the lord
[55:40] amen we'll be looking in the book of
[55:42] mark the 11th chapter and i want to read
[55:44] here uh from the 12th verse mark chapter
[55:47] 11
[55:48] and verse 12.
[55:51] it's a very powerful
[55:53] portion of the scripture and i think
[55:55] very pertinent to the day that we're
[55:56] living in
[55:58] knowing that the season and the times
[56:01] are set by the the word being vindicated
[56:04] in the age that it's meant to live amen
[56:07] in mark chapter 11
[56:09] and verse 12 and on the morrow when they
[56:10] were come from bethany he was hungry
[56:14] and seeing a fig tree far off having
[56:15] leaves he came
[56:17] if happily he might find a thing thereon
[56:19] and when he came to it he found nothing
[56:21] but leaves
[56:23] the time of the figs was not yet
[56:27] and jesus answered and said unto it no
[56:30] man eat fruit from thee hereafter
[56:32] forever and his disciples heard it
[56:35] now i'm going to skip to the 20th verse
[56:37] and in the morning as they passed by
[56:39] they saw the fig tree dried up from the
[56:42] roots
[56:43] and peter calling to remembrance saith
[56:45] unto him master behold the fig tree
[56:46] which thou cursed us
[56:48] is withered away
[56:50] and jesus answered him saying unto them
[56:52] have faith in god
[56:54] for verily i say unto you that whosoever
[56:56] shall say unto this mountain be thou
[56:58] moved
[56:59] and thou be cast into the sea shall not
[57:02] doubt in his heart but shall believe the
[57:04] things which he saith shall come to pass
[57:07] he shall have whatsoever he saith
[57:10] therefore i say unto you what things
[57:12] soever you desire when you pray believe
[57:14] that you receive them
[57:17] and you shall have them
[57:19] now in john the 14th chapter let's look
[57:21] in the eighth verse of course these two
[57:24] scriptures are connected john 14 and
[57:27] mark chapter 11.
[57:28] amen these these two are actually work
[57:32] right hand in hand in the end time john
[57:34] chapter 14
[57:36] we want to look in the eighth verse
[57:38] philip saying unto him lord show us the
[57:40] father and it sufficeth us
[57:43] and jesus saith unto him
[57:45] have i been so long time with you and
[57:47] yet thou has not known me philip
[57:50] and he saith unto me has seen
[57:53] he that hath seen me have seen the
[57:55] father
[57:56] and how sayeth thou then show us the
[57:59] father
[58:00] believeth thou not that i am in the
[58:02] father and the father in me
[58:05] and the words that i speak unto you i
[58:07] speak not of myself but the father that
[58:09] dwelleth in me
[58:11] he doeth the works
[58:13] believe me that i am in the father and
[58:15] the father in me or else believe me for
[58:18] the very work's sake
[58:20] for verily i say unto you he that
[58:22] believeth on me the works that i do
[58:24] shall he do also and greater works than
[58:27] thee shall he do
[58:28] because i go unto my father
[58:31] and whatsoever you shall ask in my name
[58:33] that will i do
[58:35] that the father may glorified in the son
[58:37] if you
[58:38] ask anything in my name
[58:41] i will do it
[58:43] amen we ask the lord to bless his word
[58:45] tonight as you may be seated
[58:47] i want to speak to you just a little bit
[58:48] tonight amen on the faith of god
[58:51] perfectly expressed the faith of god
[58:55] perfectly expressed amen these specific
[59:00] scriptures are very common
[59:02] into the church of the living god in
[59:03] this season as they should be uh we're
[59:06] thankful that these are common readings
[59:08] that these are things that are very
[59:10] known unto the church because this is
[59:12] the basis of where we take our faith
[59:15] these are the basis of why we teach the
[59:17] things we teach why we believe in the
[59:19] supernatural we believe in is because
[59:22] we're not just
[59:23] pulling these things out of the air or
[59:25] just imagining that some great thing
[59:28] could be done or that we're in some
[59:30] imaginary world but this is a reality
[59:33] that god is laid in his scripture and
[59:35] these scriptures are laying here as a
[59:37] promise tonight now i i believe in the
[59:41] perfect faith brother brown is going to
[59:43] read mark chapter 11 and and he'll he'll
[59:45] begin his a text and talk about perfect
[59:47] faith a little bit
[59:49] and he'll say but remember now
[59:51] that perfect faith needs the holy ghost
[59:54] and he'll talk about how the disciples
[59:56] in the beginning didn't have the perfect
[1:00:00] faith he said actually what they
[1:00:01] possessed is they possessed a power but
[1:00:04] they didn't possess a perfect faith and
[1:00:06] he'll actually use a case where they
[1:00:08] wasn't able to take care of the case and
[1:00:11] then the lord was asked why wasn't this
[1:00:13] case amended and jesus said because of a
[1:00:16] lack of faith so he showed them that
[1:00:18] they certainly had the power to do it
[1:00:21] but now whether they had the faith to
[1:00:23] operate it and he was showing this was
[1:00:25] the very case and this and brother
[1:00:26] branham will take it like this and say
[1:00:28] now branham tabernacle he said there's
[1:00:30] the bride today the holy spirit is here
[1:00:32] with power but you haven't got faith to
[1:00:35] move it do you see it'll take faith to
[1:00:37] move that and then he starts out to say
[1:00:39] it like this if i got a shell that i
[1:00:42] hand loaded and i'll know what it'll do
[1:00:44] by ballistics i like the word but i've
[1:00:47] got the gun i've got to fire the gun the
[1:00:50] fire has to get to the powder and the
[1:00:52] powder's got to get to the power but
[1:00:54] it's got to have the fire to light it
[1:00:56] off
[1:00:57] and the same thing the powder's in the
[1:00:59] shell but it needs faith to charge it
[1:01:01] and to throw it out that's what it takes
[1:01:03] a perfect faith to ignite the power of
[1:01:06] the holy spirit which we have now
[1:01:10] since he has come upon us faith to
[1:01:13] ignite these great things faith
[1:01:16] something that presents it to you see
[1:01:18] something to ignite it and brother brahm
[1:01:20] describes the faith he describes the
[1:01:22] word as such as a ballistics now
[1:01:25] there's a there's a lot you could study
[1:01:26] in this but of course ballistics is
[1:01:28] talking about mostly about rifle
[1:01:30] shooting and one thing that we have
[1:01:32] found out about rifle shooting is that
[1:01:34] you can study the ballistics and they
[1:01:36] can give you a dope you know uh in
[1:01:38] modern times now they've got rifles set
[1:01:40] down to the place where people are
[1:01:42] shooting elk at a thousand yards away
[1:01:44] one shot or two shots and they're
[1:01:45] killing their elk a thousand yards it
[1:01:47] almost didn't fare
[1:01:48] but what they've been able to do is
[1:01:50] they've been able to scientifically keep
[1:01:53] nailing down the ballistics and they get
[1:01:55] the barrels better they get the gun
[1:01:57] better they get the bullets better and
[1:01:59] what they're able to do is by doing that
[1:02:01] they're able to keep reproducing the
[1:02:03] same thing over and over again they're
[1:02:06] able to tell you before you ever pull
[1:02:08] the trigger exactly what that gun is
[1:02:12] able to do and they do it by ballistics
[1:02:14] and they have proved it around the world
[1:02:16] you can take 270 maybe begin to shoot it
[1:02:18] and if you'll set that thing maybe inch
[1:02:20] or two high at 100 yards it's dead on it
[1:02:22] 200 then it starts dropping a few inches
[1:02:25] maybe 18 inches at 300 and and so on
[1:02:28] until it gets way out in a thousand
[1:02:29] yards it may be dropping 10 feet or
[1:02:31] whatever according to the velocity of
[1:02:32] the bullet but if you can know the
[1:02:34] velocity of the bullet and you can know
[1:02:36] that you can know the weight of the
[1:02:38] bullet and you can know the charge
[1:02:39] behind it you can accurately pinpoint
[1:02:42] what that bullet's going to do at a
[1:02:44] certain place at a certain time and what
[1:02:46] it's able to do so what that is is a
[1:02:48] ballistics it is a potential of what
[1:02:50] something could do but that gun cannot
[1:02:53] do nothing till you pull the trigger
[1:02:56] you can carry that 270 around you can
[1:02:58] say well am i going to do this or am i
[1:03:00] going to do this i actually have a 28
[1:03:02] nosler brother matt mclaren built and he
[1:03:04] says it'll do a lot of things but amen
[1:03:06] since all this uh since all this uh the
[1:03:09] the hikes and the rates of all the ammo
[1:03:11] and things i hadn't pulled the trigger
[1:03:12] on it one time in a while because it it
[1:03:14] it just but yet they it'll do that it'll
[1:03:17] do exactly what it'll do but i i know
[1:03:20] one thing's for certain is that that
[1:03:22] translates when brother brahm talks
[1:03:24] about it he moves it into the spiritual
[1:03:26] realm and begins to say that the word is
[1:03:28] a ballistics of our faith and that the
[1:03:31] word can be told exactly what it will do
[1:03:34] in a certain season so so faith is
[1:03:36] something that talks about long-range so
[1:03:38] the word all the way back in the days
[1:03:40] when the apostles was writing it was
[1:03:43] telling us what it would do in other
[1:03:45] ages to come and how that they're able
[1:03:47] to do it now i know for sure that the
[1:03:49] word will do exactly what it did in that
[1:03:52] day it will do it again that's brother
[1:03:54] brahman's point in ballistics that it'll
[1:03:56] do it again now abraham see brother
[1:03:58] brahm said the thing is he said maybe
[1:04:00] you've got a gun and you'll say it'll
[1:04:02] shoot it's a true shooting gun i have to
[1:04:04] hang it up on the wall he said oh sure i
[1:04:06] got a gun he said but what do you do
[1:04:08] with it see if it just hangs on the wall
[1:04:11] and that's the faith of the people you
[1:04:13] say well i'm a christian and i believe
[1:04:14] god can but what are you going to do
[1:04:17] about it you've got to put it to work
[1:04:19] you've got to turn it loose you've got
[1:04:21] to do something with it now here's what
[1:04:23] brother brown said he said you've got to
[1:04:25] get out and hunt up the devil where he
[1:04:27] says
[1:04:28] you're still hurting or and you just say
[1:04:31] he's a liar you put a beat on him you
[1:04:33] get a scope on him and don't be afraid
[1:04:36] to pull the trigger because it'll go off
[1:04:39] as sure as anything
[1:04:41] amen he's saying to us what we need to
[1:04:43] do is hunt up the devil and where the
[1:04:46] devil is saying well you're still
[1:04:48] hurting or you still got this same
[1:04:49] problem or this same situation he said
[1:04:52] if you put the bead right on him and
[1:04:54] pull the trigger amen this gun will do
[1:04:57] the same thing in this day that it done
[1:05:00] in the days of the apostle one thing
[1:05:02] that we're certain about tonight is that
[1:05:04] jesus christ remains to be the same
[1:05:07] yesterday today and forever amen it does
[1:05:10] not matter the age of the time of the
[1:05:12] church he is an unchanging god with
[1:05:15] unchanging ways and whatever he did he
[1:05:18] is still doing tonight because he is a
[1:05:21] mighty god and the word is still going
[1:05:24] to do it amen i think of the prophet
[1:05:26] talking about pulling the trigger and
[1:05:27] it's going to hit a target amen i'll
[1:05:30] tell you something tonight i've got
[1:05:31] something in my target amen i've got an
[1:05:34] old devil that's running around the
[1:05:35] churches of the living god trying to
[1:05:37] bring fear and havoc and trouble amen we
[1:05:40] got that old devil right in our target
[1:05:42] tonight and we're saying to that devil
[1:05:44] you're not going to get away with it
[1:05:46] you're you're not going to get away with
[1:05:48] these things in the church of the living
[1:05:49] god because there is a bride on the
[1:05:52] earth that knows who she is what she's
[1:05:55] doing here and what this word can do
[1:05:57] amen this word will defeat satan
[1:06:00] anywhere any place anytime under any
[1:06:03] condition you can put this word in any
[1:06:06] form whether it's bridegroom form or
[1:06:08] whether it's in bribe form it's still
[1:06:10] just as powerful tonight as it's ever
[1:06:13] been because it is the word is god i
[1:06:16] believe tonight we ought to we ought to
[1:06:18] be able to pull the trigger amen and get
[1:06:20] the same results it was got in the days
[1:06:23] of the book of acts because there's one
[1:06:25] thing for certain no matter what satan
[1:06:27] is saying no matter what he's doing in
[1:06:30] this generation amen there is another
[1:06:32] book of acts church that's on the scene
[1:06:35] today i'm not just making that up
[1:06:38] friends amen but the prophet said that
[1:06:40] if there is ever another original shoot
[1:06:43] off of the tree of life it will be
[1:06:45] another book of acts written right
[1:06:48] behind that church and i believe tonight
[1:06:50] that there is a book of acts church on
[1:06:52] the scene
[1:06:54] i'm not one that believes that it's
[1:06:55] coming i'm not thinking it's on the road
[1:06:58] somewhere tonight but i believe we're
[1:07:00] setting right here tonight i believe we
[1:07:03] have come together and then to get
[1:07:05] together against the devil and release
[1:07:08] the power of god in the church of the
[1:07:11] living god
[1:07:12] my goodness amen won't you go ahead and
[1:07:15] give him some praise amen he's a
[1:07:17] powerful god isn't he
[1:07:20] is that powerful god
[1:07:24] i know the devil fought me yesterday all
[1:07:26] they said well it'll be the first night
[1:07:28] after a while i finally said well it
[1:07:29] might be the first night but this ain't
[1:07:31] the first meeting we've had
[1:07:33] it man it might be the first night of
[1:07:34] this meeting but it ain't the first
[1:07:36] meeting you've been in and it ain't the
[1:07:38] first service you've been in and i tell
[1:07:40] you what i believe some people come to
[1:07:41] this meet with expectation in their
[1:07:43] heart i mean we come expecting god to do
[1:07:46] something we come expecting miracles in
[1:07:49] the house of god
[1:07:50] i tell you i don't know what you come
[1:07:52] for but i come to see the god in heaven
[1:07:55] perform a miracle in the church of the
[1:07:57] living god i want to see miracles in
[1:07:59] this meeting you say brother amen i
[1:08:02] don't know if you're if you should wish
[1:08:03] for those things i'm not wishing i'm not
[1:08:06] hoping i'm standing on bible-based
[1:08:08] doctrine that jesus said whenever two or
[1:08:11] three have gathered in my name i will be
[1:08:14] in the midst of him and he is a
[1:08:16] miracle-working god if he worked
[1:08:18] miracles he went 2000 years ago he's
[1:08:22] still working miracles tonight he but
[1:08:25] let us get an atmosphere of the holy
[1:08:27] ghost with the power of god to perform
[1:08:30] miracles and work many things in the
[1:08:33] church of the living god i believe
[1:08:35] healings come i believe revival comes i
[1:08:38] believe the holy ghost comes i believe
[1:08:40] people are saved and people are
[1:08:43] delivered when the angel of the lord
[1:08:45] comes in the camp of god there's a shout
[1:08:49] that comes in the camp as the power that
[1:08:52] comes in the camp amen you don't have to
[1:08:54] feel sorry for us tonight we are not a
[1:08:56] helpless hopeless people we are people
[1:08:59] that have been armed with a ballistic
[1:09:02] missile i must say of the lord we know
[1:09:05] what it will do we know what will happen
[1:09:08] when the church of the living god begins
[1:09:10] to turn loose as the power that comes
[1:09:13] from the house of god
[1:09:17] well go ahead and shut that deadlock
[1:09:23] [Applause]
[1:09:33] devil i'm not gonna give him one meeting
[1:09:35] i'm not gonna give me one sermon i'm not
[1:09:37] gonna give him one song i believe the
[1:09:40] church of the living god can put that
[1:09:42] devil on the run right now
[1:09:45] if one can make a thousand and two can
[1:09:48] make ten thousand look what a church of
[1:09:51] a living god anointed armed
[1:09:55] dangerous on fire for god look at what
[1:09:58] we're able to move to that
[1:10:01] people say to me all the time why in the
[1:10:03] world why the world
[1:10:05] you preach about people shouting and
[1:10:07] praising god i tell you why these people
[1:10:09] get healed when they praise god
[1:10:11] miracles happen when they praise god god
[1:10:15] comes in the room
[1:10:17] know the spirits are conquered while
[1:10:20] people are praising god
[1:10:25] depression leaves when you're praising
[1:10:28] god you can't be depressed with your
[1:10:30] hands up amen amen you can't be
[1:10:33] depressed while you're praising amen so
[1:10:36] if you've been fighting depression just
[1:10:38] stop praising the lord there ain't no
[1:10:41] devil can hold you there in
[1:10:44] [Applause]
[1:10:45] this is the church of the living god
[1:10:48] it's time to remind the devil who you
[1:10:50] are what you have come here for we
[1:10:53] didn't come here just for another
[1:10:55] meeting we come here to ring the heavens
[1:10:59] with waves and power of the pride of
[1:11:02] jesus christ

[1:11:19] holy ghost that has been given a message
[1:11:21] of deliverance and power i've been told
[1:11:24] i've been led to believe that the angels
[1:11:27] of the lord will be in the building
[1:11:30] tonight i've been led to believe that if
[1:11:33] i preach the message heaven will back up
[1:11:36] what's being spoken in the house of god
[1:11:41] i billion believe
[1:11:43] god led me to believe this message will
[1:11:46] create an atmosphere
[1:11:51] if we can believe right now the
[1:11:52] atmosphere that's going on in this
[1:11:54] building they might not be one sick
[1:11:56] person leave the meal

[1:12:12] grace of god

[1:15:24] god made you to worship i can't help how
[1:15:27] i am
[1:15:28] i can't help what i do i can't help it
[1:15:30] no more than a grasshopper can help me
[1:15:32] in a grasshopper or a butterfly being a
[1:15:35] butterfly or a deer being a deer there
[1:15:37] is something made them what they are and
[1:15:40] there's something made you who you are
[1:15:42] and it was god that made you
[1:15:45] and when he made you he didn't just make
[1:15:47] a human brother kenny he put a part of
[1:15:49] deity that on the inside of that human
[1:15:52] being that's why that you're another
[1:15:54] kind of creature that's why you're a
[1:15:57] believer
[1:15:58] that's why you believe when there's
[1:16:00] nothing else to believe but you believe
[1:16:02] anyhow
[1:16:05] that's why
[1:16:08] well glory to god
[1:16:10] amen i think we come to have church
[1:16:15] i believe it if you recognize your
[1:16:18] position do you know that ain't nothing
[1:16:19] can hold you if you only recognize your
[1:16:22] position tonight hey nothing can stop
[1:16:24] you amen if you only recognize because
[1:16:27] one thing you'll find out
[1:16:29] god
[1:16:30] christ and the word are all the same
[1:16:33] amen and then brother bram said and you
[1:16:36] and christ and god and the word are all
[1:16:39] the same thing amen you become the word
[1:16:42] when you receive the word and when the
[1:16:44] word of god came into you i hope you're
[1:16:46] hearing me when the word of god came
[1:16:48] into you amen do you know that it is an
[1:16:51] unfailed word what is coming to you it's
[1:16:54] not the words of a man but it's the
[1:16:56] words of god what you've received from
[1:16:59] the lord is something you can stand on
[1:17:02] it's something that you can stand do you
[1:17:04] know you're not anointed to come here
[1:17:06] tonight to fall
[1:17:09] you wasn't anointed to come to this
[1:17:11] place tonight to stumble and fall
[1:17:14] but god anointed you to rise
[1:17:17] god anointed you to stand when
[1:17:19] everything else was fallen
[1:17:22] that's why you're still standing
[1:17:26] in the most wicked age that ever was
[1:17:28] you're standing in the most terrible
[1:17:30] time that ever was you're still standing
[1:17:33] you know why you're standing because you
[1:17:35] can't fall
[1:17:39] eve fell from the word but the blood is
[1:17:43] the word
[1:17:45] you can't call because you are the word
[1:17:47] and heavens and earth can pass away but
[1:17:50] my word it shall never fall you have
[1:17:54] been ordained and predestinated of god
[1:17:57] to stand in this wicked age
[1:18:00] oh understand
[1:18:02] what an hour at a time
[1:18:06] by the way how could you say with a word
[1:18:09] because before you were you were thought
[1:18:12] and you're not just the thought of a man
[1:18:13] you're the thought of god
[1:18:15] and god's thoughts are eternal
[1:18:17] [Applause]
[1:18:19] come on now god starts your eternal he
[1:18:21] said by the way now i can't see that if
[1:18:23] you see that you will see many things
[1:18:26] if you see his thoughts or eternal
[1:18:28] you'll see why you feel the way you do
[1:18:30] tonight
[1:18:31] if you'll see his thoughts are eternal
[1:18:33] you'll understand the predestination
[1:18:35] behind your life there is nothing that
[1:18:37] can change in time what god did in
[1:18:40] eternity
[1:18:41] [Applause]
[1:18:44] there's no buttons the devil don't have
[1:18:46] any buttons in time to change what god
[1:18:49] did in eternity and we have come from
[1:18:52] eternity in a place called time but god
[1:18:55] has activated a gene that's on the
[1:18:58] inside of us and has anointed us to go
[1:19:01] back to the eternal realm and we come
[1:19:03] out of and there ain't no devil can
[1:19:05] change what god did there here
[1:19:14] he said by the way what are you saying
[1:19:15] i'm saying you're out of his reach
[1:19:19] hey man your your body's not out of his
[1:19:21] reach your spirit might not be out of
[1:19:23] his reach
[1:19:24] but your gene seed is outside of the
[1:19:28] reach of the devil that gene comes from
[1:19:31] god amen who sent it into your soul to
[1:19:36] stabilize you in an unstable world in an
[1:19:39] unstable time that there would be a gene
[1:19:41] of life on the inside and when the holy
[1:19:44] ghost begins to quicken that you you
[1:19:47] will never be that word unless first you
[1:19:50] were thought
[1:19:52] is that right
[1:19:53] unless you were thought you can't be
[1:19:55] that word
[1:19:56] now what kind of thought were you to
[1:19:57] begin with
[1:19:59] a premeditated thought of god and being
[1:20:01] a premeditated thought then that means
[1:20:04] that god had you in him before the world
[1:20:06] began
[1:20:08] yes
[1:20:09] amen you'll be seated if you won't stand
[1:20:10] tall that's okay i don't want to make
[1:20:12] you feel uncomfortable
[1:20:14] you ain't me i'm i hey we'll preach like
[1:20:17] this all night i love this
[1:20:21] you see what it is it's the very thought
[1:20:23] of god that has come down on the inside
[1:20:25] of you and the whole thing is only god
[1:20:28] materializing
[1:20:31] ain't nothing out of cater
[1:20:33] ain't nothing going wrong
[1:20:35] it's god materializing
[1:20:38] but he's materializing in the season he
[1:20:40] planned to materialize him
[1:20:42] then you know you say you say well
[1:20:44] brother wayne how in the world are you
[1:20:45] living that kind of life i'll tell you
[1:20:47] how i'm living it's by the faith of the
[1:20:48] son of god
[1:20:50] it's not our life we are living it is
[1:20:53] the life from the faith of the son of
[1:20:56] god
[1:20:57] you see you've got to have faith in what
[1:20:59] the word says you are
[1:21:01] now that's what jesus relied on
[1:21:04] he didn't rely on whether he was hungry
[1:21:06] or whether he was full he didn't rely on
[1:21:09] whether the devil was tempting him or
[1:21:11] not he relied on what god made him
[1:21:14] and you've got to have faith in what the
[1:21:16] word says you are
[1:21:18] amen and when the word of god comes into
[1:21:20] you it's made manifested because you are
[1:21:23] a believer
[1:21:25] and the believer is
[1:21:27] i love this quote and the believer is
[1:21:29] the faith of god that moves you
[1:21:33] the faith of god is what a believer is
[1:21:36] in other words you're not just here amen
[1:21:38] by yourself the faith of god is in you
[1:21:42] the faith of god that created the world
[1:21:46] is in you the faith of god that spoke
[1:21:49] when there was nothing and created a
[1:21:52] world is what's inside you tonight it's
[1:21:55] not a different faith it is the faith of
[1:21:58] god that said i will have a bride
[1:22:00] without spot a wrinkle and he spoke it
[1:22:03] but here it says tonight
[1:22:06] it's not something coming
[1:22:08] this is not something on the way this is
[1:22:11] the faith of god expressed
[1:22:15] this is the word
[1:22:17] made manifested
[1:22:19] when you think about what is a bride she
[1:22:22] is the manifestation of the word
[1:22:24] she is a living oracle of god what is
[1:22:28] that word bride well just look around a
[1:22:30] little if you want to see the face of
[1:22:32] god you're looking at the face of god
[1:22:35] when you look at the bride of jesus
[1:22:38] christ
[1:22:39] you see where it's at tonight that's why
[1:22:41] things cannot move you
[1:22:43] because you have been tied to an
[1:22:44] absolute of word that made you the faith
[1:22:48] of god
[1:22:49] i think of paul in acts 20 and 24 when
[1:22:52] he said none of these things move me
[1:22:56] well there was a lot going on in paul's
[1:22:58] day but paul wouldn't be moved by none
[1:23:00] of it
[1:23:01] because paul was a prisoner
[1:23:05] paul was a prisoner how many times you
[1:23:08] ever hear paul start out a sermon and
[1:23:10] say i paul a prisoner of jesus christ
[1:23:13] an apostle under the gentiles
[1:23:16] in a couple of the books he starts it
[1:23:17] out that way i paul a person brother man
[1:23:19] preaches a whole message on me i paul a
[1:23:22] prisoner
[1:23:22] well do you know before you can ever
[1:23:24] really have power you've got to become a
[1:23:26] prisoner
[1:23:27] before you can ever really have power in
[1:23:30] your life you have to become a prisoner
[1:23:32] to that faith of god that is on the
[1:23:35] inside of you it has to become a
[1:23:37] prisoner to that or a time post amen as
[1:23:40] paul was a man a prisoner of theology
[1:23:45] but when the light of god come over him
[1:23:48] it broke the shackles of theology
[1:23:51] and enacted a spirit or a gene that was
[1:23:54] in him that tied him to the vindicated
[1:23:57] word of the age he was living in do you
[1:24:00] see he was a powerful man once you
[1:24:03] become a prisoner of god
[1:24:05] i think of the scripture when joseph was
[1:24:08] in the scripture you see joseph before
[1:24:10] he ever went into any kind of a trouble
[1:24:12] before he ever had any kind of problems
[1:24:14] god showed joseph he would reign in
[1:24:16] power
[1:24:17] but before he could ever reign in power
[1:24:20] he had to first become a prisoner
[1:24:22] it looked like he was going down but
[1:24:25] truly the way up is down the more humble
[1:24:28] you can become to the word the more
[1:24:31] exalted god can put a man amen joseph
[1:24:34] because of him becoming a prisoner was
[1:24:37] exalted in the kingdom of pharaoh to
[1:24:40] where he was able to exercise authority
[1:24:43] and power because of being a prisoner
[1:24:47] hey man i think of this often i think of
[1:24:49] oh
[1:24:49] brother paul i think of his i think
[1:24:51] about his testimony and how paul was
[1:24:54] when when uh when he was walking that
[1:24:56] road you know it must have been a shock
[1:24:58] to paul when he got saved and realized
[1:25:01] that he had been persecuting the very
[1:25:03] thing
[1:25:04] that he that the thing that he thought
[1:25:05] was the worst actually was the thing
[1:25:08] that was the salvation of his life
[1:25:11] when he realized he was persecuting
[1:25:13] jesus christ which was that pillar of
[1:25:16] light how paul must have felt
[1:25:18] it meant when the when the shackles
[1:25:20] dropped off of his eyes and and he
[1:25:22] became as paul would call it he moved
[1:25:25] from being the prisoner of gamalia to
[1:25:28] being a prisoner of christ
[1:25:31] now i i was i was looking at this the
[1:25:33] other day and i was thinking about poor
[1:25:34] old paul amen when he become when he
[1:25:37] become a prisoner and he had to show
[1:25:38] back up and preach and he had to go back
[1:25:40] over and all the other apostles and and
[1:25:42] their other clean lineages and where
[1:25:44] they come from and i think about old
[1:25:46] paul you know sometimes i tempered felon
[1:25:49] he meant he was guilty of killing the
[1:25:50] very people that he was now going to go
[1:25:52] preach
[1:25:53] i mean i imagine it must have been some
[1:25:55] long nights for paul it must have been
[1:25:57] some some agonizing times for paul to
[1:26:00] come to grips with who he had been and
[1:26:04] what god had made him
[1:26:06] do you realize what kind of prisoner he
[1:26:08] was to even admit that he was an apostle
[1:26:11] of jesus christ what kind of prisoner
[1:26:14] had he become what did he have to master
[1:26:17] before he could acknowledge that he was
[1:26:19] an apostle of jesus christ he had to
[1:26:22] master everything in his life to be able
[1:26:24] to acknowledge to what god had made and
[1:26:27] sometimes what god makes you amen it
[1:26:30] seems big but it's hard to acknowledge
[1:26:32] what god makes you because sometimes
[1:26:35] people assume that that's some kind of a
[1:26:37] puffed up maybe they didn't deserve it
[1:26:39] or something you know but paul was a a
[1:26:41] powerful man with a powerful revelation
[1:26:44] i i was just uh i was just thinking
[1:26:46] about him the other day when brother
[1:26:47] adam would say things like he never done
[1:26:49] it in the first place
[1:26:52] how many likes that quote
[1:26:55] well if you don't like that quote you
[1:26:57] ain't read it
[1:26:59] hey man he said but but you ever notice
[1:27:01] brother philippe said as though you've
[1:27:03] never done it
[1:27:05] in other words justification is though
[1:27:07] that you've never done really you've
[1:27:08] done it but you're getting treated like
[1:27:11] you've never done it
[1:27:13] hey man i've heard stories about men who
[1:27:16] spent their lives in prison who were
[1:27:18] completely innocent
[1:27:19] i've heard stories where people were put
[1:27:21] in jail nearly went to the death row and
[1:27:24] come to find out they wasn't guilty of
[1:27:26] nothing and one day they just turned
[1:27:28] them loose hey man i i've heard that i
[1:27:31] was i was on the airplane the other day
[1:27:33] and i was sitting here thinking over
[1:27:34] some of these things i i was just
[1:27:36] sitting over there writing you know how
[1:27:37] you do on the airplanes i'm just sitting
[1:27:39] alone thinking about some of these
[1:27:40] quotes brother brown said you never done
[1:27:42] it in the first place i was thinking
[1:27:44] about it like that and about these men
[1:27:46] who get out of jail because they was
[1:27:48] innocent and this and that and i just
[1:27:50] sitting there contemplating my life
[1:27:52] where i come from and what i had been in
[1:27:54] a minute i just stopped and
[1:27:56] the people around me probably thought i
[1:27:57] was crazy because i just talk it out
[1:27:59] loud you know i just stopped myself lord
[1:28:02] i i i i just don't fit that description
[1:28:05] very well
[1:28:06] because i wasn't innocent and somebody
[1:28:09] turned me loose
[1:28:10] amen i'm guilty i i deserve all the
[1:28:13] punishments that i get i've done
[1:28:14] everything that they said that i did i
[1:28:17] went all the places they said i went i i
[1:28:19] was exactly who i was supposed to or who
[1:28:22] i was being at that time and i was
[1:28:24] sitting there contemplating that the
[1:28:25] lord got to thinking about it hey man
[1:28:27] the more i thought about it the worse i
[1:28:29] felt and i said after washable lord
[1:28:32] how in the world then can a prophet
[1:28:34] announce it's as though as i never done
[1:28:36] it i said you're going to have to help
[1:28:38] me see it in the scripture because i
[1:28:39] just don't understand i don't really
[1:28:41] don't from my own personal experience
[1:28:43] lord i don't understand how that you
[1:28:46] could that you could give me the grace
[1:28:48] and the pardon that you give me with a
[1:28:50] man that i was i'm sitting here
[1:28:52] discussing it with the lord and it was
[1:28:54] almost an audible voice brother aaron i
[1:28:56] heard him say to me he said you
[1:28:59] are a barabbas
[1:29:01] i was sitting on that plane
[1:29:03] and i could hear that i literally could
[1:29:05] hear a voice he said you
[1:29:08] are a barabbas
[1:29:10] and i thought for a minute i thought
[1:29:11] barabbas
[1:29:13] oh i don't know who barabbas was
[1:29:16] y'all know who barabbas was
[1:29:18] barabbas was a prisoner
[1:29:20] he was a prisoner for different reasons
[1:29:22] he was a prisoner because of his sins
[1:29:24] and he was a prisoner because of things
[1:29:26] he'd done wrong he was a prisoner from
[1:29:29] the problems that he done a thievery and
[1:29:32] murder he was he was a really bad man
[1:29:35] and they put him in prison brother joel
[1:29:37] they put him in prison and you know that
[1:29:39] barabbas was scheduled to be executed
[1:29:42] the very day jesus was being crucified
[1:29:45] how many knows he was going to be he was
[1:29:46] executed he was already under judgment
[1:29:50] he had already had an executioner
[1:29:52] sentence upon him he was already in the
[1:29:55] prison waiting execution and while he
[1:29:58] was up there laying in the cold i love
[1:30:00] how brother branham says it he said that
[1:30:02] he said that a roman jailer come walking
[1:30:04] up the the sidewalk that morning he said
[1:30:07] that bartimaeus is laying over there
[1:30:09] cold and shivering hungry scared he said
[1:30:12] he's worried about today he's trying to
[1:30:14] prepare himself for a cross no way to do
[1:30:16] it at all knows he deserves it he said
[1:30:19] he's laying there in the corner and he
[1:30:21] can hear a soldier coming up the the
[1:30:23] sidewalk there the walk and he said he
[1:30:25] could hear the clink of the armor and
[1:30:27] the slap of the sword he said when that
[1:30:29] big roman soldier come to the door and
[1:30:32] looked over and he said barabbas was
[1:30:33] kind of shuttering and he laid there the
[1:30:36] big door began to open brad was raised
[1:30:38] up off of the ground he said i guess i'm
[1:30:40] ready i guess i'm ready to go and the
[1:30:43] man took a hold of him and got his hands
[1:30:46] and started taking the the shackles off
[1:30:48] his hands
[1:30:49] and built down and started taking the
[1:30:51] shackles off his legs and bravo said
[1:30:53] what are you doing why why are you
[1:30:55] taking these things off i'm supposed to
[1:30:57] go die
[1:30:58] and that roman he put his arm around
[1:31:00] barabbas and he said come here i want to
[1:31:02] show you something
[1:31:03] and he walked him over to the side
[1:31:06] he said you see down there
[1:31:08] you see them three crosses down there
[1:31:10] that can only be three men today that
[1:31:12] will be crucified
[1:31:14] and we have a law here in israel you
[1:31:17] know very well that there's called a
[1:31:19] passover pass and on the day of passover
[1:31:22] amen they give him one free person that
[1:31:25] can go completely free in the honor of
[1:31:27] the passover and he says he said well
[1:31:30] what's that got to do with me sir he
[1:31:32] said well do you see that man hanging in
[1:31:34] the middle down there his name is jesus
[1:31:37] and he's an innocent man and he never
[1:31:39] done nothing to nobody i i said in his
[1:31:41] trial the other day he had nothing
[1:31:44] against him at all but they they decided
[1:31:46] to crucify him and he's going to take
[1:31:49] your place up there on that cross and
[1:31:52] bravo said but what does that mean to me
[1:31:54] sir he said i'll tell you what it means
[1:31:56] to you it means you're free
[1:32:01] listen wait a minute
[1:32:03] you mean i'm free he said so i'm telling
[1:32:05] you
[1:32:06] you're free to go
[1:32:09] but but i don't have i don't have to do
[1:32:11] anything i don't have to i don't have to
[1:32:12] do anything there's nothing required of
[1:32:14] me at all he said no sir you're not
[1:32:16] understanding that man's paying your
[1:32:19] penalty
[1:32:20] the penalty is being paid but that man's
[1:32:22] paying it and when barabbas realized
[1:32:25] that he was completely free he walked
[1:32:28] off of that hill amen i don't know what
[1:32:30] first church he started but i would
[1:32:32] imagine he was a preacher and i was a
[1:32:35] preacher of grace and mercy he probably
[1:32:37] had a jailhouse ministry he probably was
[1:32:40] effective among all the other prisoners
[1:32:48] brother
[1:32:49] later on i sat there on that i sat there
[1:32:52] on that plane i started i just
[1:32:54] immediately got my computer up and typed
[1:32:56] in i am barabbas and sure enough brother
[1:32:59] branham said i am a barabbas i said well
[1:33:03] praise god the prophet was a barabbas
[1:33:05] too
[1:33:07] and i started reading that story of the
[1:33:09] roman soldier setting it loose and when
[1:33:11] i was sitting and reading that story it
[1:33:13] just dawned on me
[1:33:15] that the power
[1:33:17] of the gospel
[1:33:18] is so powerful
[1:33:20] that even when a roman soldier was
[1:33:23] preaching it
[1:33:24] it still gave liberty
[1:33:27] even when a man who wasn't called to
[1:33:29] preach was telling the story that there
[1:33:32] was people still went free well let me
[1:33:34] tell you something nice amen this
[1:33:36] message of the cross this message of the
[1:33:39] resurrection has got so much power and
[1:33:42] it will set every person at liberty
[1:33:44] it'll set every child free it'll set
[1:33:47] every heart free you don't have to be
[1:33:49] bound and imprisoned with lust and
[1:33:52] undrivingness and drugs and alcohol
[1:33:55] there's a god here tonight amen
[1:33:59] [Applause]
[1:34:00] but let me tell you as
[1:34:04] god has liberated you
[1:34:06] he took your place at the cross
[1:34:11] no needs you to be bound tonight you can
[1:34:13] be completely free right here in the
[1:34:15] house of god you can be free to rejoice
[1:34:19] you can be free to dance you can be free
[1:34:22] take your liberty and enjoy god
[1:34:29] come on
[1:34:31] and i'm not trying to put nobody up i'm
[1:34:33] trying to give somebody enough liberty
[1:34:35] to shake loose i've been so loyal to
[1:34:38] seeing spirit it's so heavy thing that
[1:34:41] you got to carry around all the time but
[1:34:43] we don't have to carry ain't that
[1:34:46] anymore we have bear the name of jesus
[1:34:50] christ
[1:34:55] i'm a barabbas
[1:34:57] and i am a free man
[1:34:59] i've been freed by the holy ghost but i
[1:35:02] have become personal to another
[1:35:08] but as a prisoner of jesus christ
[1:35:10] healing is mine
[1:35:12] joyous mind love is mine peace is my
[1:35:17] deliverance is mine as a prisoner of
[1:35:20] christ holy ghost feelings and power has
[1:35:24] been given to the church
[1:35:26] [Applause]
[1:35:27] you know paul paul being a prisoner i
[1:35:30] thought about poor paul i thought about
[1:35:32] him and i thought about his writings in
[1:35:35] the book of romans can you imagine when
[1:35:37] paul who was a seed of abraham the stalk
[1:35:40] amen he said he was born on the eighth
[1:35:42] day amen he actually was circumcised he
[1:35:45] was a very he was a very eloquent man
[1:35:48] taught very eloquently and was humbled
[1:35:50] down
[1:35:51] to follow this message
[1:35:53] and while he was following this amen he
[1:35:55] had killed me and
[1:35:57] and he had persecuted the church
[1:35:59] and i imagine long nights
[1:36:01] but when god inspired the man to write
[1:36:03] the book of romans
[1:36:05] it's a powerful thing
[1:36:07] in romans 4 7 when paul begins to pen
[1:36:10] and saying blessed are these whose
[1:36:12] iniquities are forgiven and whose sins
[1:36:14] are covered for blessed is the man to
[1:36:17] whom the lord will not impute sin
[1:36:20] he's writing about the seed of
[1:36:22] abraham paul is writing about the seed
[1:36:25] of abraham have you ever thought about
[1:36:27] this paul is the seed of abraham
[1:36:30] and he's writing about himself
[1:36:32] concerning his former life and he was
[1:36:36] saying god has blessed me and the
[1:36:39] blessing on me is he has forgiven my
[1:36:42] iniquities amen and he's covered my sins
[1:36:45] and he will not impute my iniquity
[1:36:48] against me do you know what that means
[1:36:51] that means god didn't have a book
[1:36:52] marking down paul's wrongs but under
[1:36:55] paul's conversion his book was thrown in
[1:36:59] the sea of forgiveness and deliverance
[1:37:02] come to paul's life
[1:37:03] amen he was able to write that blessed
[1:37:06] is the man whom the lord will not impute
[1:37:08] sin he was speaking of what david said
[1:37:11] concerning the seed of abraham who could
[1:37:13] have preached that better than david
[1:37:16] who could have preached it better than
[1:37:18] david king david who failed his family
[1:37:20] who fell his life with all of his
[1:37:23] struggles and all the troubles that were
[1:37:24] there remember that remember that king
[1:37:26] david amen who was exposed under the
[1:37:29] ministry of nathan and had to be
[1:37:31] repented he even himself said he
[1:37:33] deserved death but god rich in mercy had
[1:37:36] a prophet say back to him david you'll
[1:37:39] surely not die remember the grace that
[1:37:42] was extended and david wrote a disgrace
[1:37:44] in the book of psalms which which paul
[1:37:47] would be speaking of psalms 103 and
[1:37:50] psalms 32 i'll tell you it's a secret
[1:37:52] and a powerful thing i know you know the
[1:37:54] scripture but i'd like to quote it to
[1:37:55] you psalms 103 and 1 said david bless
[1:37:58] the lord o my soul
[1:38:01] and all that is within me
[1:38:04] bless his holy name
[1:38:05] bless the lord o my soul and forget not
[1:38:08] all of his benefits who forgiveth all
[1:38:12] that iniquity and who healeth all thy
[1:38:16] diseases he blessed the lord him that
[1:38:19] don't forget the benefits now amen he's
[1:38:21] a healer of diseases but he forgiveth
[1:38:24] all
[1:38:25] hey can you say it with me he forgiveth
[1:38:27] all
[1:38:28] thine iniquity you say preacher what are
[1:38:30] you saying i'm saying there's a reason
[1:38:33] to bless the lord tonight
[1:38:34] i'm saying that david was instructing
[1:38:37] you on the way to praise god no matter
[1:38:39] the circumstances of your life no matter
[1:38:42] the situation no matter the troubles
[1:38:45] there is a secret coming from david
[1:38:47] having unstoppable worship have an
[1:38:49] unstoppable praise david knew how to
[1:38:52] praise god anywhere anytime under any
[1:38:55] situation if there was a man who should
[1:38:58] have quit praising the lord it was david
[1:39:00] but david said i'll bless the lord
[1:39:03] because of the goodness of the lord not
[1:39:05] because of the goodness of david not
[1:39:07] because of what david could do or what
[1:39:10] david couldn't do he blessed the lord
[1:39:12] because the goodness of god and let me
[1:39:15] tell you if we would start blessing the
[1:39:17] lord because of his goodness if we would
[1:39:20] start praising the lord because of his
[1:39:22] goodness i tell you what would happen
[1:39:24] that would be an eruption of a
[1:39:26] stimulated praise from the house of god
[1:39:29] because god is so good that you can
[1:39:32] never praise god enough to make up for
[1:39:36] what he's done for you and i
[1:39:39] there ain't nobody like jesus
[1:39:41] there ain't nobody done anything for us
[1:39:43] like jesus he said preacher amen i i
[1:39:46] think i think uh that you're a little
[1:39:49] bit crazy well you think i'm crazy if
[1:39:50] you want to
[1:39:52] amen but i am a free man
[1:39:54] amen i might be what people think i'm a
[1:39:56] fanatic but i'm not i have found a
[1:39:59] channel to worship god in every
[1:40:02] circumstance of my life i have found a
[1:40:05] way to put the lord before me and
[1:40:07] worship god at all times amen what is it
[1:40:10] it's something that can deny the natural
[1:40:14] senses and receive the holy spirit
[1:40:17] i'll tell you what it is it's a super
[1:40:19] sense that god gives you do you know
[1:40:21] that god gave you the same sense in you
[1:40:24] that he created the world with
[1:40:27] the same thing he created the world with
[1:40:30] is on the inside of you
[1:40:32] then that god that stood there when
[1:40:34] there was nothing
[1:40:35] and said let there be
[1:40:39] and it came forward out of nothing
[1:40:41] indivisible light
[1:40:43] the same god that did that
[1:40:45] the way he did that is on the inside of
[1:40:49] every believer here tonight that has the
[1:40:51] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:40:54] that supersense is god it's the faith of
[1:40:56] god in you that's the part of god that
[1:40:59] comes into you
[1:41:00] and gives you a super sense
[1:41:03] super because it is able to go over all
[1:41:07] your natural senses
[1:41:11] it moves past all your natural senses
[1:41:14] look at this amen when we look at this
[1:41:16] tonight amen the prophet of god said in
[1:41:18] looking to the unseen he said what we
[1:41:20] need to do is not think for ourself but
[1:41:23] let our mind amen and let the mind of
[1:41:26] christ come into us
[1:41:28] we are not to think for ourself
[1:41:30] and we're to call to contrary to
[1:41:32] anything
[1:41:33] except what he said
[1:41:35] as though it was not
[1:41:37] no matter what our eyes claim to be
[1:41:40] we do not live by what we see
[1:41:42] we live by what we believe
[1:41:47] that's how the church is alive
[1:41:49] by what we believe
[1:41:51] that's how we live it's not what we see
[1:41:54] but by what we believe
[1:41:56] amen it is there in ii corinthians when
[1:41:58] paul said for this cause we faint not
[1:42:00] though our outward men perish the inward
[1:42:02] man is renewed day by day for our light
[1:42:05] affliction is but for a moment but it
[1:42:07] worketh far more exceeding an eternal
[1:42:09] weight of glory while we look not at the
[1:42:12] things which are seen
[1:42:14] but we are at the things which are not
[1:42:17] seen for the things which are seen are
[1:42:19] temporal but the things which are not
[1:42:20] seen are eternal
[1:42:23] so there is a way to break the sound
[1:42:26] barriers of this world the prophet of
[1:42:28] god said we can break the barrier we can
[1:42:30] get past the barrier he said but we're
[1:42:32] going to do it he says see we can shout
[1:42:35] the victory of a living god once we pass
[1:42:38] the barrier by looking to the unseen the
[1:42:42] way to get past a barrier in your life
[1:42:45] is to look to the unseen
[1:42:46] [Applause]
[1:42:48] whatever barrier comes up in your life
[1:42:50] whether it's a sin barrier whether it's
[1:42:52] an unbelief burial whether it's a
[1:42:54] reasoning or a doubt or some feeling
[1:42:56] that's come upon you
[1:42:58] there is a way to get past the bearer
[1:43:01] and it's by the unseen world
[1:43:04] now when you look at this you'll find
[1:43:06] out that god has a way to get it by but
[1:43:08] natural man is bound to the senses of
[1:43:11] man but the spirit of god amen gives you
[1:43:14] a super sense
[1:43:16] now really you can't really believe
[1:43:18] until you're regenerated
[1:43:21] you can't really believe until you've
[1:43:23] been filled with the holy ghost
[1:43:25] see he sees people say well brother
[1:43:27] wayne i think i did but listen what a
[1:43:28] prophet said he said listen you're only
[1:43:31] taking what somebody else said what
[1:43:33] you've learned by intellectual what
[1:43:35] you've learned by the natural senses but
[1:43:37] when the sixth comes in the holy spirit
[1:43:40] it takes away all the reasoning these
[1:43:42] six senses of these five senses and you
[1:43:45] lift up into the sixth one
[1:43:47] amen it'll take it'll make you believe
[1:43:49] things that you can't see
[1:43:52] that you can't taste you can't smell it
[1:43:54] you can't hear it it does something for
[1:43:58] you
[1:43:59] then you can say jesus christ amen
[1:44:02] because you have witnessed it it's not
[1:44:04] an intellectual teaching it's what you
[1:44:07] have experienced
[1:44:09] you see the faith of god produces an
[1:44:12] experience in your life to believe god
[1:44:15] regardless
[1:44:17] to believe god whatever's taking place
[1:44:20] you said brother wayne the situations
[1:44:22] around me are so dark that you've got
[1:44:24] something in you that you can literally
[1:44:27] create a world and go live on it if
[1:44:30] there was not a law that possessed to
[1:44:33] keep you from doing it the authority and
[1:44:36] power to create a world is in you right
[1:44:39] now
[1:44:40] you don't have to go somewhere and get
[1:44:42] it if you're a believer you don't have
[1:44:43] to go somewhere and store it up you
[1:44:45] don't have to go somewhere and collect
[1:44:46] it from a certain guy in a certain place
[1:44:49] as a believer who has received the holy
[1:44:52] ghost the same sense that was in god
[1:44:56] that created the world is in that
[1:44:58] believer and the power that could create
[1:45:01] a world is in you right now
[1:45:06] you say right now i said right now man
[1:45:09] is omnipotent
[1:45:11] man is all-powerful man is unlimited
[1:45:14] when he comes in contact with god you
[1:45:16] say well i know some powerful things but
[1:45:19] there is nothing more powerful than a
[1:45:21] believer who is in contact with his god
[1:45:24] a believer in contact with god has the
[1:45:27] ability to create by the spoken word a
[1:45:31] believer who comes in contact with god
[1:45:33] has a faith on the inside of them that
[1:45:36] can believe every word that god has
[1:45:39] spoken
[1:45:41] do you know there's things anointed for
[1:45:43] this aid that other ages have not been
[1:45:45] able to express
[1:45:48] do you know that there are words that
[1:45:50] are anchoring in you that could not
[1:45:52] anchor in any other generation
[1:45:56] even when brother branham was preaching
[1:45:57] the message perfect faith go look it up
[1:45:59] he's preaching along and he comes to
[1:46:01] mark the 11th chapter and he talks about
[1:46:04] jesus they've been cursing that victory
[1:46:06] and then he turns around he says and if
[1:46:09] you say unto this mountain
[1:46:11] he said then that puts you
[1:46:13] right back in the scripture see he says
[1:46:16] now it's pretty deep he said and he's
[1:46:19] passing right over you because it can't
[1:46:21] anchor
[1:46:22] and i thought isn't that something
[1:46:24] because that's exactly what happened in
[1:46:26] the days of isaiah when isaiah was
[1:46:29] prophesying to a congregation and he
[1:46:31] said a virgin shall conceive
[1:46:34] brother brother said that word that come
[1:46:36] out of that prophet's mouth circled the
[1:46:38] earth for 600 years
[1:46:40] waiting for our heart to anchor into and
[1:46:44] when it found that little woman mary the
[1:46:47] word anchored in that heart now i want
[1:46:49] to say something maybe some of them are
[1:46:51] sitting there that day maybe it did
[1:46:53] anchor in a few but that word was being
[1:46:56] spoke right then and a prophet maybe
[1:46:59] didn't know it but god knew that there
[1:47:01] was a future generation coming that that
[1:47:04] word of mark 11 was going to anchor in
[1:47:07] their souls
[1:47:09] it cannot anchor everywhere
[1:47:12] you said brother wayne if it's a word
[1:47:14] why couldn't it anchor jesus explains it
[1:47:16] he said the word was put in as a seed
[1:47:19] and it fell into ground he said and some
[1:47:22] were some were ground of thorns and
[1:47:24] thistles and some with rocks it shows
[1:47:26] you that the word is broadcast over a
[1:47:29] great big area
[1:47:31] he said but sure as it fell among them
[1:47:34] he said it also fell among good ground
[1:47:37] and brother man said what is good ground
[1:47:39] he said that's
[1:47:40] pre-prepared ground
[1:47:43] he said that ground was prepared before
[1:47:47] the foundations of the world do you
[1:47:50] recognize something tonight that god for
[1:47:53] ordained you
[1:47:55] before the world began to believe this
[1:47:58] word
[1:48:00] as sure as god spoke it he knew that
[1:48:03] there would be a bride it would fall
[1:48:06] into in the last days you said brother
[1:48:08] wayne how do i know i'm that bride
[1:48:11] because there's something in your heart
[1:48:13] that's expressing it and believing it
[1:48:16] and it's falling on the inside of you
[1:48:23] it's expressing and falling on the
[1:48:24] inside of you it's a seed in a good
[1:48:26] ground now if you like that in the bible
[1:48:30] i can show it to you in the book of
[1:48:31] romans brother bram said romans 8
[1:48:33] 28-34 ephesians 1
[1:48:36] 1-5 and that's what works his faith
[1:48:37] expressed
[1:48:38] it falls into that ground
[1:48:40] of the bride says she's pre-prepared and
[1:48:43] ordained before the world begin to
[1:48:45] actually come into the church amen now
[1:48:48] you say preacher what are we supposed to
[1:48:50] do i think it's powerful because brother
[1:48:52] branham turns around and says to us he
[1:48:54] said and i believe there's a church on
[1:48:56] this road tonight
[1:48:57] now he's saying that in perfect faith
[1:49:00] there's a church on the road you say how
[1:49:02] could he be saying it back there there's
[1:49:04] a church on the road because he was
[1:49:06] creating it right there
[1:49:08] he was he was sending forth a word that
[1:49:11] would bring a church in the future
[1:49:14] that would be a church of the faith of
[1:49:17] god it would be a spoken word seed bride
[1:49:22] you wouldn't just be another church you
[1:49:24] would be the word of god spoken into a
[1:49:28] generation and activated by the power of
[1:49:31] the living god you didn't just show up
[1:49:34] you didn't just crawl into the church
[1:49:37] but the god of all heaven foreword
[1:49:40] danged you and sell you and brought you
[1:49:43] into the house of god
[1:49:48] no man come to me except my father draw
[1:49:51] him is that what he said is that what he
[1:49:54] said amen then jesus said i do nothing
[1:49:57] unless i see it with my father
[1:50:00] and my father worketh and i worketh to
[1:50:03] it
[1:50:04] are you hear me no man comes unless my
[1:50:07] father then worked it out and god has
[1:50:10] already worked it out of how you was
[1:50:12] going to get here and how you would be
[1:50:14] sitting in the seat tonight
[1:50:17] are you hearing me barnabas
[1:50:19] god worked it out
[1:50:23] he worked it out so you can shout
[1:50:26] and you can preach so you can believe
[1:50:29] but you can have faith
[1:50:33] while that devil all better ready to get
[1:50:35] out of here
[1:50:38] i feel like it's a really bad night for
[1:50:40] the devil
[1:50:43] a really bad night for the devil amen
[1:50:45] because see a prophet was showing us
[1:50:47] she's on the road
[1:50:49] people say on the road that that bride's
[1:50:52] been on the road the whole time but
[1:50:54] what's this prophet now stepping in
[1:50:56] position identifying the season and the
[1:50:58] people for this promises of this age you
[1:51:01] said prove it by the bible i'm glad you
[1:51:03] asked go over to the book of joshua and
[1:51:06] look in the sixth chapter and see if
[1:51:08] there wasn't some walls around a little
[1:51:11] woman named rahab
[1:51:12] [Applause]
[1:51:14] a bride type
[1:51:17] come on she was a gentile being redeemed
[1:51:21] under joshua's ministry
[1:51:23] she never even come up in the first two
[1:51:25] polls she never even intended across the
[1:51:28] jordan she wasn't even in the scripture
[1:51:31] but when the jordan was crossed and
[1:51:34] joshua went dividing the land there was
[1:51:36] a gentile for an adoption anointing
[1:51:43] come on church
[1:51:46] y'all know the law she didn't deserve it
[1:51:48] she was a prostitute she was a gentile
[1:51:52] she was in a walled city law said she
[1:51:54] couldn't even come out under the jubilee
[1:51:57] but god worked it out
[1:51:59] god worked it out with joshua
[1:52:03] he said joshua you march around these
[1:52:06] walls
[1:52:12] and they walked around the walls but on
[1:52:15] the seventh day
[1:52:18] amen on the seventh time
[1:52:20] all the trumpets sounded together and
[1:52:23] with one voice
[1:52:25] the walls begin to come down listen if
[1:52:28] you can't come out from behind the wall
[1:52:31] and you belong to god he'll tear the
[1:52:33] wall down
[1:52:37] god worked it out with joshua turn out
[1:52:40] the wall and bring my people out of
[1:52:43] there
[1:52:45] you're in a jailhouse of sin god will
[1:52:47] tear down the jailhouse
[1:52:51] i know you'll do it as paul
[1:52:54] as barnabas they were locked away but
[1:52:57] they got to please him like you're
[1:52:58] praising tonight
[1:53:01] and the walls got to shake it
[1:53:08] i got all my shouting shoes
[1:53:14] the walls started coming down the earth
[1:53:16] started quaking
[1:53:18] the gentile in the story began to say he
[1:53:21] was going to kill himself didn't say it
[1:53:23] out loud paul never saw him paul he was
[1:53:26] out of the reach inside of paul but in
[1:53:29] the middle of that dark jail he screams
[1:53:31] out to a roman soldier soldier boy
[1:53:34] [Applause]
[1:53:36] don't take your life
[1:53:38] believe on jesus christ
[1:53:41] and that same voice that was in the days
[1:53:43] of paul has sounded out in this day and
[1:53:46] right up there amen in washington or bc
[1:53:49] there was a soldier coming the back of
[1:53:51] brother man's meetings remember that
[1:53:53] soldier boy don't take your life believe
[1:53:57] oh jesus christ and the walls will come

[1:54:08] was walls he said what was wrong with a
[1:54:10] man he had had a homosexual relationship
[1:54:12] with a man one time and was confused
[1:54:15] whether he was homosexual or not and the
[1:54:17] devil was telling him you're not normal
[1:54:19] you'll never be normal but when he got
[1:54:22] under the presence of that ministry of
[1:54:24] the son of man he looked back to where
[1:54:28] he come from and he said you're a real
[1:54:30] man son you're not that kind of person
[1:54:32] at all turn around and go home to your
[1:54:35] family and the man started coming down

[1:54:41] i'm free
[1:54:42] well let me tell you if that man could
[1:54:45] sing in that day

[1:55:11] red sea she didn't but she believed it
[1:55:14] all the same
[1:55:16] she never saw the battles but she
[1:55:18] believed it all the same you know why
[1:55:21] because she was a believer amen and she
[1:55:23] was your type
[1:55:26] come on bride you might not have been
[1:55:28] there when the bridge fell but you

[1:55:47] been being worked out to come to this

[1:55:53] things amen to get you to the position

[1:56:11] angel that accompanies this message i
[1:56:14] have led to believe that that angel is
[1:56:16] right here in the building tonight
[1:56:21] i'm led to believe it's the same angel
[1:56:24] that was in the deal of lines with
[1:56:26] danger
[1:56:27] that was at the red sea crossing with
[1:56:29] moses
[1:56:30] that was the same angel that was with
[1:56:32] joshua at the walls and he's sitting in
[1:56:35] the building tonight to deliver the
[1:56:38] children of god from sicknesses and
[1:56:41] diseases

[1:56:47] miracles i am led to believe that there
[1:56:50] is no weapon born against us that little
[1:56:53] hospital
[1:56:56] i'm not going to give satan an inch
[1:56:57] around i'm not going to give him one

[1:57:55] circumstances abraham was 25 years and
[1:57:59] he couldn't have a child but he did not
[1:58:01] stagger he meant he didn't stag her you
[1:58:04] know i didn't stagger because he was
[1:58:07] persuaded
[1:58:09] he was persuaded that god was more than
[1:58:12] able to work it out he could give him a
[1:58:15] new body he could change his life
[1:58:18] circumstances
[1:58:21] oh come on church you're not a people

[1:58:36] i won't even measure it i won't believe
[1:58:38] it i won't ask for to let any faith
[1:58:40] because circumstances is not what i'm
[1:58:43] talking about i'm talking about the
[1:58:45] faith of god expressed perfectly in a
[1:58:48] bride who stands in the evilest age it
[1:58:51] ever was and defies satan on every inch
[1:58:54] of ground and he tries to take
[1:58:57] [Applause]
[1:58:58] we got nurses sitting here to find satan
[1:59:00] in his hospitals we've got policemen to
[1:59:02] find satan in in the cars aiming out on
[1:59:05] the streets even what are we doing
[1:59:07] there's a people of god that are defined
[1:59:10] that old devil you know you know what
[1:59:12] we're really dealing with amen i know
[1:59:14] satan wanted to put it on circumstances
[1:59:16] but somebody's going to ignore them
[1:59:18] because they have a different report to
[1:59:19] believe
[1:59:20] [Applause]
[1:59:22] if that's the only report we had was a
[1:59:24] medical one we'd just have to shut up
[1:59:26] and sit down
[1:59:29] but we got a different one
[1:59:31] we got another report we believe we have
[1:59:33] been delivered of god a report that has
[1:59:37] been paid for in the blood of jesus
[1:59:39] christ
[1:59:40] [Applause]
[1:59:41] oh i know the devil don't like this one
[1:59:44] if you can watch a pressure come these
[1:59:46] days you kill this one brother man said
[1:59:47] he went into a hospital room with a
[1:59:49] young man dying of diphtheria
[1:59:52] and that young man's name was bob
[1:59:54] bosworth
[1:59:55] it was brother bosworth's son and he was
[1:59:58] dying of diphtheria and brother adam
[2:00:00] went and prayed for him at the request
[2:00:02] of the mother and father natural brother
[2:00:03] and pray he said the boy is healed
[2:00:06] that's the safe the lord and the woman
[2:00:09] raised up and started hugging my husband
[2:00:12] and they started hugging one another and
[2:00:14] saying thank god thank god our boy is
[2:00:16] going to live and the nurse began to say
[2:00:19] what are you doing praising god at this
[2:00:22] kind of moment amen everything says
[2:00:24] they're dying amen but he says oh but
[2:00:27] wait a minute honey
[2:00:29] you have been trained to only look at
[2:00:31] your instruments but i have been trained
[2:00:35] to look at the word of
[2:00:38] god the word says he's healed
[2:00:42] the word says he's healed
[2:00:44] he said preacher i know about somebody
[2:00:46] that claimed that i know about this and
[2:00:48] i feel this and i in those channels of
[2:00:52] reasoning in those channels of memory
[2:00:54] you will be a defeated being but if
[2:00:57] you'll step out of your reasoning and
[2:00:59] get back into the word of god there'll
[2:01:02] be a faith that'll come into your heart
[2:01:04] there'll be no devil there'll be no
[2:01:06] power there'll be nothing that can
[2:01:08] defeat you because there's a victory
[2:01:11] there's a victory in the word of god
[2:01:14] faith is your victory it masters every
[2:01:18] circumstance it is the conqueror have
[2:01:21] everything of your life you are not a
[2:01:23] helpless hopeless group of people god
[2:01:26] has so fixed this up
[2:01:30] but the devil is defeated before he ever
[2:01:33] got started
[2:01:37] i'll shout that devil down
[2:01:45] not here satan
[2:01:47] not an evil light tabernacle not in the
[2:01:50] house of the lord amen there's a group
[2:01:52] of people that believe
[2:01:53] [Applause]
[2:01:56] it's a preacher
[2:01:58] i'll tell you we've been having some
[2:01:59] hard times around here
[2:02:01] all right i got that
[2:02:04] come on
[2:02:06] it's a hard time
[2:02:08] it's a hard time for everybody
[2:02:11] this is the darkest evilest
[2:02:13] corruptest age it's ever been
[2:02:15] there's more trouble going on right now
[2:02:17] than in the history of mankind
[2:02:19] according to daniel the 12th chapter be
[2:02:21] greater trouble since the days of
[2:02:23] beginnings according to matthew 24 it'll
[2:02:26] be brother ramsey and it's in its fruit
[2:02:28] now
[2:02:29] and it's in his fulfillment now and it
[2:02:32] ain't done nothing but got darker since
[2:02:34] 1960
[2:02:38] but somehow satan has tried to convince
[2:02:40] you
[2:02:41] that if he can get it dark enough he can
[2:02:43] whip you
[2:02:44] if he can get the valley low enough he
[2:02:46] can defeat you
[2:02:48] he is a dumb devil
[2:02:51] because god has already fixed this
[2:02:53] meeting up
[2:02:54] god's already fixed some things and put
[2:02:56] it together and he's already got a
[2:02:58] miracle in the making right here in the
[2:03:01] church of the living god
[2:03:07] he said by the way in these kinds of
[2:03:09] times this is where god really likes to
[2:03:11] work
[2:03:12] god really likes ask them hebrew boys
[2:03:15] god don't even move till it's a very
[2:03:17] mass moment but when he moves
[2:03:22] he moves
[2:03:23] [Applause]
[2:03:26] i tell you this i i'm a bible reader and
[2:03:28] that's why i find something i think is
[2:03:30] pretty good
[2:03:32] the other day i was reading along there
[2:03:33] in the bible and i got to reading about
[2:03:35] a battle that happened with ahab and he
[2:03:38] whipped about i believe there's a bunch
[2:03:39] of syrians he whipped amen and they was
[2:03:41] way high on the mountain whipped all
[2:03:43] these syrians after the bible was over
[2:03:45] they was all putting their stuff up and
[2:03:47] they thought man this is all done we're
[2:03:49] going to pack up everything's good amen
[2:03:51] and here comes along the prophet
[2:03:53] and he begins to prophesy and he says to
[2:03:56] ahab he said look now don't put up all
[2:03:58] your weapons he's coming another battle
[2:04:02] don't put up your weapons they come in
[2:04:03] another battle
[2:04:05] he said what do you mean is coming
[2:04:06] another battle well the lord heard your
[2:04:09] enemy as it went off of the mountain
[2:04:11] and while it was going off of the
[2:04:13] mountain it said that israel was only
[2:04:16] strong on the mountain
[2:04:18] and their god is only the god of the
[2:04:20] mountain
[2:04:21] but if we could get them in the valley
[2:04:24] that we could whip them down there
[2:04:27] and the prophet said to him because they
[2:04:29] have said this
[2:04:31] because they have spoken this
[2:04:34] amen i will be the god in the valley the
[2:04:38] same as i am the god on the mountain
[2:04:46] god's gonna do it again
[2:04:49] let me prophesy to you god's gonna do it
[2:04:51] again
[2:04:53] the same god that with that devil when
[2:04:55] you were a mile high he's the same god
[2:04:58] and with that devil when you're in the
[2:05:00] bottom of the lowest valleys of your
[2:05:02] life
[2:05:11] i heard him i heard that old devil he
[2:05:14] said well i'll tell you what evening
[2:05:15] light something else when they're up on
[2:05:17] the mountain
[2:05:18] but you let letting kobed come along you
[2:05:20] let a few trials come along you let them
[2:05:23] miss a few services and have a few hard
[2:05:25] times we'll get them in the valley they
[2:05:27] won't be so strong then we'll get them
[2:05:30] then we'll just destroy them at that
[2:05:32] moment amen and because the devil has
[2:05:35] said that
[2:05:36] and because the devil has thought that
[2:05:38] amen i can hear the word of the lord
[2:05:41] coming back to the church of the living
[2:05:43] god and i am not just the god of even
[2:05:47] light when she's on the mountain
[2:05:51] but i'm the god of eating in life even
[2:05:54] when it's in the valley
[2:05:58] listen to me believers you have maybe in
[2:06:01] a hard time in your life maybe you don't
[2:06:04] go to church here maybe you're visiting
[2:06:06] here but the devil has decided in this
[2:06:09] age that he could destroy the church but
[2:06:12] god has chosen this age
[2:06:15] to put the devil in his place
[2:06:20] put the devil in his place
[2:06:23] do you know where that is actually you
[2:06:25] know the place the devil belongs
[2:06:28] according to ephesians the first chapter
[2:06:31] and the second chapter that satan has
[2:06:33] been put under the feet of jesus christ
[2:06:37] and if satan is not under your feet he's
[2:06:41] out of place
[2:06:42] so i think it's time for the church
[2:06:47] to put satan back in his place tonight
[2:06:51] put him back where he belongs
[2:06:53] stomp on the head of that devil and say
[2:06:56] i'm a serpent stopper i'm a servant
[2:06:58] loser i'm a holy ghost field child i'm
[2:07:01] the living god i may be in the valley
[2:07:04] but i can still whip to them
[2:07:09] i may be in the valley but i can still
[2:07:12] look for them
[2:07:15] who are you you're the church of the
[2:07:18] living god
[2:07:20] [Applause]
[2:07:35] let our musicians come tonight
[2:07:37] i think we ought to give that devil a
[2:07:39] weapon
[2:07:43] i think our singers already seen him out
[2:07:45] of here
[2:07:46] i think our worshipers
[2:07:48] are to pull out their pull out for
[2:07:51] instance and begin to clap our hands and
[2:07:54] begin to open the lips and begin to
[2:07:56] worship and praise until the devil can't
[2:07:59] even stand the sound
[2:08:03] satan if you're going to attack the
[2:08:05] church you're going to have to hear our
[2:08:07] testimonies you're gonna have to hear
[2:08:09] our praise you're gonna have to hear our
[2:08:12] rejoicing you're gonna have to hear our
[2:08:14] praise
[2:08:16] you can't whip this bride she's already
[2:08:19] conquered she's already over the devil
[2:08:22] tonight
[2:08:23] [Applause]
[2:08:28] glory to god
[2:08:31] i know we ought to be sounding retreat
[2:08:32] but i don't know the sound
[2:08:35] i know we ought to be saying back up and
[2:08:37] sit down but i don't know the sound only
[2:08:40] thing that i was taught
[2:08:42] i was trained by a prophet and the only
[2:08:45] thing he taught me to say was charge
[2:08:48] take this land
[2:08:50] you're more than able to do it no giant
[2:08:53] no weapon no water no territory no
[2:08:57] circumstances no devils can take the
[2:09:00] church of the living god
[2:09:14] challenge
[2:09:22] the devil don't know what to do with you
[2:09:24] he's through everything he's got at you
[2:09:27] [Applause]
[2:09:30] he don't have anything else
[2:09:32] [Music]
[2:09:35] i'm still here
[2:09:40] i want him to see it
[2:09:42] i'm still here
[2:09:45] whether i'm in the valley
[2:09:47] or whether i'm on the mountain i am the
[2:09:50] nightmare that the devil wakes up and
[2:09:52] thinks about
[2:09:56] even the weakest christian
[2:09:59] when it begins to play
[2:10:02] hell begins to tremble
