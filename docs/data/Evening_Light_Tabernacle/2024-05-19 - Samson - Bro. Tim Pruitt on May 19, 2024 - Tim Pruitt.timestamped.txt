[49:24] ago did this we took our two services
[49:26] and put together in one so we sing a
[49:28] little longer and preach a little longer
[49:30] and and we don't come back in the
[49:32] evening but we we do uh Worship the Lord
[49:35] together and so let's give him our all
[49:37] this morning amen God bless you thank
[49:39] you for the music today and the worship
[49:41] to the Lord and we so appreciate our
[49:44] musicians and their dedication to the
[49:47] Lord none of them are paid they just do
[49:49] it as a service to God and we're so
[49:52] thankful and and so appreciate them amen
[49:56] if you're turn with me to John chapter 5
[49:59] I'm going to read from verse 32 and
[50:02] we'll go down through um the 39th verse
[50:06] and then we'll let you be seated there
[50:09] is another that beareth witness of me
[50:12] and I know that witness which he
[50:13] Witnesses of me is true you sent unto
[50:18] John and he bear witness unto the truth
[50:21] but I receive not testimony from man but
[50:24] these things I say that you might be
[50:26] saved
[50:27] he was a burning and Shining Light and
[50:30] you were willing for season to rejoice
[50:33] in his light but I have a greater
[50:35] witness than that of John for The Works
[50:38] which the father hath given me to finish
[50:41] the same works that I do bear witness of
[50:44] me that the father has sent me and the
[50:48] father himself which has sent me has
[50:52] borne witness of me you have neither
[50:54] heard his voice at any time nor seen his
[50:57] shape and ye have not his word abiding
[51:01] in you for whom he has sent him you
[51:05] believe not search the scripture for in
[51:09] them you think you have eternal life and
[51:13] they are they which testify of me God
[51:17] bless you can be seated and if you will
[51:19] be turning to the Book of Judges we're
[51:22] going to read a second reading from
[51:24] there Judges chapter 13
[51:28] verse1 and looking into the word of God
[51:31] as the Bible said Jesus saying search
[51:35] the scriptures for in them you think you
[51:37] have eternal life they are they that
[51:39] testify of me so we're going to look
[51:43] into the scripture to see it bear
[51:46] witness of Christ and his manifestation
[51:50] of himself in our day so if you'll look
[51:53] with me to Judges chapter 13 and and
[51:57] we'll read from verse one and the
[51:58] children of Israel did Evil again in the
[52:01] sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered
[52:04] them to the hand of the Philistines 40
[52:08] years and there was a certain man of
[52:10] Zora of the family of the danites whose
[52:13] name was manoah and his wife was Baron
[52:16] and bar not and the angel of the Lord
[52:19] appeared unto the woman and said unto
[52:22] her behold now Thou Art Barren and beest
[52:26] not
[52:27] but Thou shalt conceive and bear a son
[52:31] now therefore beware I pray thee and
[52:33] drink not wine nor strong drink nor eat
[52:37] any unclean thing for Lo Thou shalt
[52:40] conceive and bear a son and no razor
[52:44] shall come on his head for the child
[52:47] shall be a Nazarite unto God from the
[52:51] womb and he shall begin to deliver
[52:54] Israel out of the hands of the
[52:57] Philistines and then the woman came and
[53:00] told her husband saying a man of God
[53:03] came unto me and his countenance was
[53:05] like the countenance of an Angel very
[53:09] terrible but I asked him not whence he
[53:11] was neither told me his name but he said
[53:16] unto me behold Thou shalt conceive and
[53:20] bear a son and now drink no wine nor
[53:23] strong drink nor eat any unclean thing
[53:27] for the child shall be a Nazarite to God
[53:31] from the womb to the day of his death
[53:35] amen my I tell you I just love to read
[53:38] the word of God and I'd like to read in
[53:41] the Bible about
[53:43] angels appearing to men and women as he
[53:46] has down through time the Supernatural
[53:50] is always something that is of so vital
[53:53] importance that we experience in our
[53:56] Christian walk and and of course um it's
[54:00] not just an Old Testament occurrence for
[54:03] angels to appear but Angels appeared in
[54:06] the New Testament they appeared into
[54:08] Zachariah to Mary to Jesus to um Mary
[54:14] Magdalene and those at the Tomb of Jesus
[54:17] they appeared unto Peter when he was in
[54:20] prison and set him free they they
[54:22] appeared unto Cornelius at his house
[54:26] there and and told him to send after one
[54:30] Simon called Peter and he would tell him
[54:33] the way of life he appeared unto Phillip
[54:36] and uh instructed him in his
[54:39] Evangelistic work appeared to Paul when
[54:43] he was out on the sea and about to be
[54:45] destroyed and the angel of the Lord came
[54:48] and stood by him and told him that he
[54:51] would not perish and of course he
[54:54] appeared to John the angels of the Lord
[54:57] appeared to John the Revelator it's
[55:00] happened many times down to the ages and
[55:03] of certainty in our day it was a
[55:06] frequent occurrence to brother brandham
[55:09] and the appearing of angels should be
[55:11] happening today and and of course Even
[55:14] in our personal life that we should have
[55:17] Angelic
[55:18] visitations um and of course you say
[55:22] well the Holy Spirit has come and and
[55:24] yeah he had already came and and he
[55:26] appeared to Paul and he also appeared to
[55:28] Peter and to Phillip and all of that so
[55:30] there even though the holy spirit is
[55:32] here and is our guide and our leader we
[55:35] also can receive uh instructions and
[55:39] direction from from Angelic spirits of
[55:42] God now Samson was chosen to be a
[55:46] deliverer he was a gift of strength that
[55:49] was given to him ministered by an Angel
[55:53] and I'm going to speak about him today
[55:55] as I look at Samson as a a type of of
[56:00] Christ he's a type of the believer as
[56:02] well the beli in church and um Samson's
[56:07] mother of course might have told him
[56:10] when he was but a little bitty boy he
[56:12] said right now you may just seem to be
[56:15] an ordinary boy but you were born to be
[56:19] a Nazarite to the lord and there are
[56:22] just things that you cannot do if you
[56:24] want to keep your strength
[56:26] right for the Lord before the foundation
[56:30] of the world has ordained you for this
[56:33] ministry and so God identified himself
[56:37] with this boy that was chosen to be a
[56:41] Nazarite now you know again he would he
[56:45] would show this even in the Book of
[56:46] Revelation as he holds seven stars in
[56:49] his hands and these Seven Stars are
[56:52] seven Messengers that with seven um men
[56:56] that are sent out by God for down to the
[57:00] ages that God would use them to bring
[57:02] the church back to the truth and so he
[57:06] he again is identifying himself with man
[57:10] as he as as he's depicted in Revelation
[57:13] 1 walking among the seven golden
[57:16] candlesticks and these are God's
[57:19] Messengers and they may be repudiated
[57:22] they may be questioned but and and maybe
[57:25] in human Minds it may not seem to
[57:28] qualify and maybe that's even what the
[57:31] world would think about you or me this
[57:33] morning but nevertheless they were God's
[57:36] men and God's stars to the age and so
[57:40] God would use in in his time and Abraham
[57:43] and he lied and he used to Moses and he
[57:46] rebelled and he used to Jonah and he
[57:49] disobeyed and a Samson and he sinned and
[57:52] a David and he murdered and he used
[57:56] Joshua and and a Joseph and and even
[57:59] though that many of these we would we
[58:01] would pick out some very severe
[58:04] blemishes you know um and and and maybe
[58:08] these with blemishes in the Bible that
[58:10] are spoke of men with blemishes out
[58:13] outnumber those whose whose lives seem
[58:16] to be perfect but all were his none can
[58:21] deny that he used them and by his holy
[58:24] spirit that he put put within them to to
[58:27] defeat the Devil in their age and to to
[58:30] their own messenger they stood or they
[58:33] fell or to their own master I meant they
[58:36] either stood or fell and in them was
[58:39] accomplished The Sovereign will of God
[58:42] and so when we look at a man like Samson
[58:45] we know his story we know where where he
[58:49] he faltered and he failed but yet at the
[58:52] same time he was a man used of God in
[58:55] his time and in his place because he was
[58:59] a man called for a purpose and you two
[59:03] are called for a
[59:05] purpose you see everything is going to
[59:08] work for your good you that that to see
[59:12] that you will achieve God's purpose your
[59:16] job is to defeat Philistines Philistines
[59:20] of unbelief and sin and doubt and to
[59:23] deliver God's people from bondage you
[59:26] have been called for a purpose and every
[59:29] child of God that is born of the spirit
[59:32] of God is a Samson you too are a
[59:37] Nazarite unto God you don't have to be a
[59:40] Samson that floats with the world though
[59:43] and finds the prostitute women like
[59:45] Samson did because Samson would give his
[59:48] strength to God but his heart to Delilah
[59:51] but you can give your strength and your
[59:53] heart to God in fact those who are were
[59:56] sealed by the holy spirit of God do just
[59:59] that every every child of God is a
[1:00:02] Samson you are an earthshaking devil
[1:00:06] slaying devil defeating
[1:00:10] Overcomer amen and you are here sent and
[1:00:13] predestined for this age and this time
[1:00:16] to be a deliverer to stand up for Truth
[1:00:20] for righteousness in your day and your
[1:00:23] hour every Church movement has been a
[1:00:26] Samson down through his time is the
[1:00:29] church um you know is um or the Samson
[1:00:33] is a type of the Holy Ghost Church
[1:00:36] laughed at so peculiar but not realizing
[1:00:40] his
[1:00:41] peculiarity is it power with God and
[1:00:44] that's what makes us special amen is
[1:00:47] that we are set apart set aside
[1:00:52] chosen amen God called God sent
[1:00:56] and and and and called To Be A peculiar
[1:01:00] people a holy nation a righteous people
[1:01:04] set apart to God now of course you know
[1:01:07] as we spoke about him in Revelation 1
[1:01:11] Jesus walking in the middle of the seven
[1:01:13] golden candlesticks and he says the in
[1:01:16] Revelation 2:1 these things said he that
[1:01:19] holdeth the Seven Stars in his right
[1:01:22] hand who walketh in the midst of of the
[1:01:26] seven golden candlesticks you see what
[1:01:29] he was in the first age he is in all
[1:01:33] ages so this is why we will pick about a
[1:01:36] man by the name of Samson and we will
[1:01:39] look at his life because we're searching
[1:01:41] the scripture to see that it's just more
[1:01:44] than
[1:01:45] stories but that it is actually a
[1:01:49] prophecy prophesying and we want to look
[1:01:51] in the scripture and see ourselves in it
[1:01:54] and and see the manifestation of God in
[1:01:57] the hour so what God was in the first
[1:02:00] age he is in all ages to every believer
[1:02:03] he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:02:06] today and forever what he did once he is
[1:02:09] still doing and he will keep on doing
[1:02:13] I'm glad to know that aren't you amen
[1:02:17] like like he said of these seven
[1:02:18] Messengers held in his hands they speak
[1:02:21] and they act upon his authority he
[1:02:23] stands behind them with all power of God
[1:02:26] head he's saying I walk amongst the
[1:02:29] church I am here among you it doesn't
[1:02:32] matter whether we look back to a man
[1:02:34] called Samson thousands of years ago and
[1:02:37] we come forward to our age he's still
[1:02:40] walking among his children for he says I
[1:02:43] am with you always and I will be with
[1:02:46] you to the end of the consummation amen
[1:02:49] so they are full of the Holy Ghost full
[1:02:52] of faith on fire with the fire of God
[1:02:55] stand in there with a purpose amen with
[1:02:58] with a call in their lives and I want
[1:03:00] you to understand that every believer is
[1:03:04] that a people that is called set apart a
[1:03:07] Nazarite unto the Lord and you don't
[1:03:10] have to think oh my you don't have to
[1:03:13] think oh and cry in your heart oh oh if
[1:03:16] I could have just been back there if I
[1:03:18] could just been there when angel came
[1:03:21] down to manoah and his wife and and set
[1:03:24] apart a man oh if I could have just been
[1:03:27] there when God would come with Mighty
[1:03:30] strength upon the church and in another
[1:03:33] age he moved by the power of God oh if I
[1:03:36] could only be there there's no need to
[1:03:37] look back amen you can look up amen but
[1:03:41] and you can see him that is walking in
[1:03:44] the midst of the seven churches through
[1:03:47] all the ages of what he was in the first
[1:03:49] days here he is in the last days so what
[1:03:52] you seen him working there in that day
[1:03:55] in Samson you'll see the same power
[1:03:58] working in individuals today in the
[1:04:01] Church of Jesus Christ he's standing
[1:04:04] there expressing
[1:04:06] himself what he is his life as a
[1:04:10] sustainer and The Giver of all give good
[1:04:13] gifts so we think about that of course
[1:04:16] without
[1:04:17] Jesus without his strength and this is
[1:04:20] what we find about
[1:04:22] Samson my he he would be moved upon on
[1:04:25] by the spirit of God but when the spirit
[1:04:28] left
[1:04:29] him without him he was just a puny
[1:04:32] ordinary
[1:04:34] man overcome so
[1:04:36] easily are you with me so that's exactly
[1:04:40] the way it says in the Bible Christ is
[1:04:43] our life and without him we're just a
[1:04:47] religious Society we're just a club a
[1:04:50] meaningless Gathering of people you know
[1:04:53] it's like a corpse that is bejweled and
[1:04:55] dressed is still a corpse amen the
[1:04:58] church no matter what her programs are
[1:05:01] or what her gracious efforts might
[1:05:04] achieve without Christ she's a corpse
[1:05:07] also amen but with him in her midst with
[1:05:11] him motiv in her she becomes the
[1:05:13] Wonderman of all amen and his body the
[1:05:17] fullness of him that filth all in all so
[1:05:21] what he was when he worked in the First
[1:05:23] Ages he is even now in this
[1:05:26] te Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:05:30] and
[1:05:31] forever so this is the way that we want
[1:05:33] to look at it because let me remind you
[1:05:37] when we look at Samson's life you see a
[1:05:39] man who with the spirit of God could
[1:05:41] defeat enemies but without the spirit of
[1:05:44] God was
[1:05:47] powerless you see even with Israel there
[1:05:50] was one difference between Israel and
[1:05:52] the rest of the Nations and that was God
[1:05:56] you put God to one side and Israel was
[1:05:59] like any other nation and when Samson
[1:06:02] cut off his hair he was like every other
[1:06:04] man when you put the leadership of the
[1:06:07] Holy Ghost aside the church is nothing
[1:06:10] but the world with God's name attached
[1:06:12] to
[1:06:13] it so the world and all and the church
[1:06:16] are all of the same luck just like Jacob
[1:06:18] Esa Esau the same parents but the spirit
[1:06:22] of God is what makes the difference I
[1:06:25] want you to remember we must have his
[1:06:29] spirit so we search the scriptures in
[1:06:33] them we think we have eternal
[1:06:36] life we see what the Holy Spirit did in
[1:06:40] the Bible here he is doing the same
[1:06:43] thing today so I want to say to you
[1:06:47] again you are the Samson
[1:06:51] today you are called to
[1:06:54] Triumph to defeat the enemies of God and
[1:06:59] to deliver his
[1:07:01] people this is why you're called every
[1:07:03] age you know would seem to start out
[1:07:05] like Samson with power and that's the
[1:07:08] way the church would do the church would
[1:07:10] start out with power with determination
[1:07:13] I'm going through Jesus I'm going
[1:07:16] through only to lose strength to some
[1:07:21] Delilah and who is that
[1:07:23] Delilah it's anything or anybody that
[1:07:27] Woos you away from the power of
[1:07:30] God that's who it is every age this is
[1:07:34] repeated as a cycle of Revival and death
[1:07:37] never fails you you see it in the last
[1:07:39] day a complete departing from the
[1:07:42] faith Samson was born to be a Nazarite
[1:07:46] it was his Covenant with God that gave
[1:07:49] him his
[1:07:51] power and in this case the angel appears
[1:07:54] to his wife and she receives the promise
[1:07:58] of a child that would deliver Israel and
[1:08:01] instructions are given to her how to
[1:08:03] raise his child he was to be a Nazarite
[1:08:07] set apart consecrated that's what
[1:08:11] Nazarite means it means a consecrated
[1:08:14] one the Bible says we are to be
[1:08:18] nazarites where do you find that in the
[1:08:20] Bible well let's go to 2 Corinthians
[1:08:24] 6:14
[1:08:25] and he says be ye not unequally yolked
[1:08:30] together with
[1:08:31] unbelievers for what Fellowship ha
[1:08:34] righteousness with
[1:08:36] unrighteousness and what communion have
[1:08:39] light with
[1:08:42] Darkness so what does it mean to be
[1:08:44] unequally yolked it means to be in a
[1:08:47] situation that binds you to the
[1:08:50] decisions and actions of people who have
[1:08:53] values and purposes incompatible with
[1:08:56] Jesus values and
[1:09:00] purpose and what communion had light
[1:09:03] with Darkness you see light and darkness
[1:09:07] cannot be in
[1:09:09] Fellowship Christ and Satan cannot work
[1:09:12] together Believers and unbelievers
[1:09:14] cannot work together they cannot
[1:09:17] Fellowship together and as a Nazarite we
[1:09:21] are God's temple on Earth since it's
[1:09:25] Spirit lives in
[1:09:27] us that's why we must separate ourselves
[1:09:30] from any kind of formal binding
[1:09:33] relationship with
[1:09:35] unbelievers be careful in business
[1:09:38] relations because you know you you got
[1:09:41] to know those you're are joining with
[1:09:43] have the same
[1:09:45] values amen this is why it's so
[1:09:47] important for believers to marry other
[1:09:51] believers you must never marry an
[1:09:53] unbeliever because it bind you to
[1:09:56] decisions and actions of people who are
[1:09:59] have incompatible values and
[1:10:03] purposes so he goes on to say what
[1:10:07] Concord had Christ with B that is the
[1:10:13] devil or what part hath he that
[1:10:16] believeth with an
[1:10:18] Infidel stay away from those things he's
[1:10:21] letting you know stay away from those
[1:10:22] things that you know that the gossip of
[1:10:26] unbelief watch out and guard yourself
[1:10:28] who who are always negative toward the
[1:10:32] Church toward the ministry watch out for
[1:10:34] bites that are always looking on the
[1:10:37] backside trying to find a flaw and to do
[1:10:39] this they're they're just trying to
[1:10:41] justify their own behavior don't listen
[1:10:44] to
[1:10:45] gossip amen you you are
[1:10:48] Nazarite don't spread gossip you are a
[1:10:53] Nazarite yeah you hear someone say
[1:10:55] something hurtful about somebody else
[1:10:57] don't go run and tell that person and
[1:11:00] hurt them with it stop it in his
[1:11:03] tracks shut the gossip up and if you
[1:11:06] just got to if you just have to repeat
[1:11:09] it then get that on your knees and
[1:11:11] repeat it before the Throne of God and
[1:11:14] let God deal with it you see we are to
[1:11:17] live holy and to be
[1:11:19] Sanctified like the priest who went
[1:11:21] behind the holies of holies and the
[1:11:23] world was shut off of away from them we
[1:11:26] are to live a a Sanctified holy life
[1:11:31] where the world is shut off amen we need
[1:11:35] we need to realize we need to be like
[1:11:37] Isaiah was in the temple and say Lord
[1:11:39] cleanse my
[1:11:41] lips amen even cleanse my ears that I
[1:11:44] only hear what the spirit is saying amen
[1:11:47] for you are the Temple of the Living God
[1:11:49] listen for verse 16 says what agreement
[1:11:52] hath the temple of God with Idols for
[1:11:54] you are the Temple of the Living God as
[1:11:58] God said I will dwell in them and walk
[1:12:02] in them and I will be their God and they
[1:12:05] shall be my
[1:12:07] people amen
[1:12:10] wherefore wherefore since I'm going to
[1:12:12] be God they're going to be my Holy
[1:12:15] Temple I'm going to dwell in them then
[1:12:19] come out from among them and be ye
[1:12:22] separate say the Lord and touch not the
[1:12:24] UN clean thing and I will receive you
[1:12:27] and will be a father to you and you will
[1:12:30] be my sons and daughters sayeth the Lord
[1:12:33] God Almighty amen this is this is him
[1:12:36] saying you're a Nazarite you are to live
[1:12:39] a separate
[1:12:41] life amen you you are nazarit unto God
[1:12:45] Amen because any man that is
[1:12:48] born born again when he becomes a
[1:12:52] Believer he becomes a Nazarite where he
[1:12:55] separates himself from anything contrary
[1:12:58] to the word of God this is this was
[1:13:00] Samson what the angel saying your son is
[1:13:03] going to be a
[1:13:04] Nazarite no razor will come on his head
[1:13:08] he is going to look different there's
[1:13:10] going to be distinctive qualities about
[1:13:13] him that are different he's not going to
[1:13:14] be able to touch anything that is dead
[1:13:17] he will not touch anything that is
[1:13:19] unclean he is Holy unto the Lord his
[1:13:23] life is going to be separate from from
[1:13:26] touching the the the the The Grapes of
[1:13:29] the Vine and Wine he he's going to be
[1:13:32] holy separated unto me you see that's
[1:13:35] exactly where God calls us to be a
[1:13:38] church that is Holy
[1:13:41] separated separated from unbelief from
[1:13:44] sins and and and the things of the world
[1:13:48] a church separated from anything that
[1:13:51] would be uh that would be wrong that
[1:13:54] would be contr to God's word you as a
[1:13:57] Nazarite are to live separated life unto
[1:14:02] the Lord now you may have lived a dirty
[1:14:07] sinful rotten
[1:14:10] unconsecrated life you may have smoked
[1:14:12] drank defiled your body but let me tell
[1:14:15] you that's your first
[1:14:17] birth I want to get this to you amen
[1:14:21] that's your first
[1:14:23] birth but you have a new birth
[1:14:26] Earth now just as Samson's parents were
[1:14:29] visited by the by an Angel at the moment
[1:14:33] of your new birth a portion of the
[1:14:36] pillar of fire came into you so where do
[1:14:39] you get that brother Tim listen The
[1:14:40] Upper Room amen what happened the the
[1:14:43] fire of God came and separated himself
[1:14:46] and a lick of fire Came Upon each one of
[1:14:49] them amen and it come that Holy Spirit
[1:14:53] came in you and it burned out without
[1:14:55] sin nature and you were born again and
[1:14:58] and at that moment
[1:15:00] consecrated as one set apart from God
[1:15:04] let me tell you this this visitation of
[1:15:07] the Angel to separate you from the from
[1:15:09] the rest of the world make you a
[1:15:10] Nazarite is not unique to Samson that's
[1:15:12] you
[1:15:13] too I want to get it to you that's you
[1:15:16] too you have been called selected
[1:15:20] ordained of God to be separated and an
[1:15:23] angel of God by the pillar of fire
[1:15:27] came into you to make you the Temple of
[1:15:30] the Holy Ghost and you are a clean
[1:15:32] vessel not an unclean vessel and you're
[1:15:35] not to defile your body come on you are
[1:15:38] to live holy righteous because he said I
[1:15:41] am Holy now so you see you're set apart
[1:15:45] you know a maybe it's not like what
[1:15:48] happened at Jesus baptism where a
[1:15:50] prophet witnessed it and said I saw a
[1:15:52] Dove came down I saw this here it came
[1:15:55] down like a dove and and Here It Came
[1:15:58] Upon him and I saw the Spirit abide
[1:16:01] maybe a prophet didn't witness it but it
[1:16:03] happened anyway maybe you didn't see it
[1:16:06] but it it happened anyway amen you may
[1:16:09] not have seen it or experiened it but it
[1:16:12] was an Angelic Heavenly present that
[1:16:15] Vindicated you and called you out as a
[1:16:18] set apart one you have been set apart
[1:16:23] for a purpose
[1:16:28] now Samson was to have a sign signifying
[1:16:32] this
[1:16:33] vow for him it would be his uncut
[1:16:38] hair and a fe forbidden to touch wine
[1:16:42] neither was to he eat anything
[1:16:45] unclean every Christian is to be
[1:16:48] separated as a
[1:16:50] Nazarite he is not to partake of strong
[1:16:53] drink of course he takes communion but
[1:16:56] not to excess and to keep himself from
[1:16:59] the world he is certainly not to drink
[1:17:01] the wine of
[1:17:02] fornication that is offered by the
[1:17:05] harlots spoken of in the Bible in
[1:17:08] Revelation chap 18- 21 we we are
[1:17:13] Nazarite we are ones that are separated
[1:17:16] unto God having heard God's clear voice
[1:17:20] saying come out from among them be you
[1:17:23] holy for I am holy amen for without
[1:17:27] Holiness no man shall see the
[1:17:31] Lord now there have been many nazarites
[1:17:35] or separated ones throughout the Bible
[1:17:38] we're just going to talk about them just
[1:17:40] very very briefly because in a sense
[1:17:44] Abraham was a
[1:17:46] Nazarite meaning that he was separated
[1:17:48] unto God that's for a purpose do you
[1:17:52] know that every child of a Abraham is a
[1:17:55] Nazarite with a vow that go that God
[1:17:59] swore by himself you've been called
[1:18:03] selected just like Abraham Abraham was a
[1:18:07] separated person God called him at 75
[1:18:09] years
[1:18:10] old and separated him from his from his
[1:18:14] uh family and pulled him out and said
[1:18:17] here you walk with me that's right amen
[1:18:20] come out and separate yourself and from
[1:18:22] anything contrary to what you believe
[1:18:25] you remember they they were believed in
[1:18:27] multiple gods and Abraham come out and
[1:18:30] God showed him I'm one
[1:18:32] Lord here he comes and he reveals
[1:18:35] himself as the one true and living God
[1:18:38] and it separates himself from his his
[1:18:40] family that were Idol
[1:18:42] worshippers you know and and then he
[1:18:45] would hold on to a promise of a son and
[1:18:48] this would set him apart is a man of
[1:18:50] Faith who would believe the Word of
[1:18:53] Promise
[1:18:55] regardless of what the circumstances was
[1:18:58] even when it got worse he kept believing
[1:19:01] he was a
[1:19:02] Nazarite Amen in his own way Aaron was a
[1:19:07] Nazarite unto the Lord he was separated
[1:19:09] among his Brethren to Bear the
[1:19:11] birthstones and to be the high priest
[1:19:14] Paul was a Nazarite and the Lord he was
[1:19:17] separated from his Orthodox Church to
[1:19:19] the word of the Living God even Jesus
[1:19:22] was a Nazarite not in the s
[1:19:25] of the vow of touching something from
[1:19:27] The Grapes but in a sense he was wholly
[1:19:31] separated under God for a
[1:19:34] purpose there were other nazarites in
[1:19:36] the Bible like Samuel and John the
[1:19:39] Baptist and even today with with brother
[1:19:42] Brandon we mentioned him a moment ago
[1:19:44] remember the angel told him Never Smoke
[1:19:48] never drink don't defile your body in
[1:19:50] any way I have a work for you to do when
[1:19:53] you're older
[1:19:56] when he was in Europe a lot of the
[1:19:57] religious Elders tried to share with him
[1:19:59] the German beer and he said no I'm a
[1:20:02] Nazarite un the Lord I'm separated and I
[1:20:06] want you to know you are a separated
[1:20:08] people sir from your new
[1:20:12] birth you are separated called to be a
[1:20:16] Nazarite unto the Lord now before before
[1:20:19] Samson was born God sent an angel to
[1:20:23] identify his coming
[1:20:25] Israel had gotten away from God and they
[1:20:27] cried to God and God gave them a
[1:20:31] deliverer now Samson didn't have
[1:20:34] shoulders like a barn door he was no
[1:20:37] Goliath he was a shorty he was described
[1:20:41] as a little curly-headed shrimp with
[1:20:43] Seven
[1:20:44] Locks everybody probably thought he was
[1:20:47] a just a mama's boy no doubt the
[1:20:49] Philistines wonder where does that
[1:20:52] hidden power come from
[1:20:56] amen I want you to know we have the same
[1:20:59] Seven Locks that he
[1:21:01] had it's the seven spirits of God that
[1:21:05] manifest itself through seven Church
[1:21:08] ages and I just want to say ain't no
[1:21:11] Delilah going to take that away from me
[1:21:14] like Samson it's our covenant with God
[1:21:17] it's the secret of our power the holy
[1:21:20] spirit in every
[1:21:21] age and we must have him because without
[1:21:25] him we are
[1:21:27] powerless we are
[1:21:29] defeated you know our sisters are given
[1:21:32] a Nazarite vow the sign of a Nazarite to
[1:21:35] show they are separated from the world
[1:21:37] and identified with
[1:21:39] Christ amen this is why Paul in 1
[1:21:42] Corinthians 11 will just list it right
[1:21:45] down and tell you know of the of the
[1:21:47] Covenant of the man and the Covenant of
[1:21:49] the woman and the man is to show of his
[1:21:52] headship with Christ with his cutting
[1:21:54] hair and a woman is to show that she is
[1:21:57] under the submission of her husband
[1:22:00] which is her head and the head of the
[1:22:02] man which is Christ so she is under
[1:22:04] Christ subjection by her uncut
[1:22:07] hair this is
[1:22:10] Bible amen how important this identity
[1:22:14] is people unashamedly today wears every
[1:22:17] kind of tattoo there is identify with
[1:22:20] this or that maybe some rock group some
[1:22:22] some Idol some Stars something some
[1:22:24] sentimental something that means
[1:22:26] something to them but what about this
[1:22:29] identity amen a man looking there
[1:22:33] standing there as a cleancut individual
[1:22:36] representing God to his age a woman
[1:22:39] there standing there representing the
[1:22:42] Bride of Jesus Christ showing a sign the
[1:22:46] Bible said is a sign that shows power on
[1:22:49] her head with by by the
[1:22:52] angels with uncut hair
[1:22:56] this is a Bible the Bible the world
[1:22:58] identifies with the woman Jezebel with
[1:23:00] her pain and her hair do but the Bible
[1:23:02] said If a woman cuts her hair she
[1:23:05] dishonors her head which is her husband
[1:23:08] and her husband is a head with God so
[1:23:10] she dishonors God and her husband so you
[1:23:14] see again we realize that when they cut
[1:23:17] off their hair they deny the Nazarite
[1:23:20] vow that I am subject to every word of
[1:23:23] God who who we we'll be subject to that
[1:23:26] but not that we we will do this but not
[1:23:29] that God wants a people wholly separated
[1:23:32] to him you see a woman that is a child
[1:23:35] of God lets her hair grow to show she is
[1:23:39] consecrated to every word of God not
[1:23:43] just some of it but we believe it all we
[1:23:47] believe the whole Bible and so this is
[1:23:49] the word of God the Bible tells you
[1:23:51] exactly that we exactly in 1 Corinthians
[1:23:55] 11 he identifies it very clearly you
[1:23:58] know about the Nazarite vow you be it as
[1:24:02] a man with with cut hair you women
[1:24:05] buried as a woman with uncut hair this
[1:24:09] is Bible this is this is exactly what
[1:24:12] it's t it shows you're separated unto
[1:24:15] God under the sign of a covenant that
[1:24:18] she is under the headship of the word
[1:24:22] amen the same thing with the church The
[1:24:24] Church Must Believe every word we're not
[1:24:27] going to let one word be cut off not one
[1:24:31] lock a
[1:24:32] promise amen not one word of God we're
[1:24:36] going to believe every word of God Amen
[1:24:38] because Jesus Christ is the same
[1:24:41] yesterday today and forever and every
[1:24:44] word of God is his is of his is truth so
[1:24:48] sisters God has chosen you to bear in
[1:24:50] your body the mark of Jesus Christ with
[1:24:53] uncut hand
[1:24:55] you're identifying yourself with the
[1:24:57] bride of Christ who is subject to every
[1:25:01] word on the other hand Brothers there's
[1:25:04] a sign on your head of cut hair and it
[1:25:06] says I'm the head of my home and Christ
[1:25:09] is my
[1:25:10] head amen now so you see it's a total
[1:25:16] separation here we are as Nazarite
[1:25:19] totally separated from the Fashions of
[1:25:23] this Modern Age
[1:25:25] it doesn't matter what the rest of the
[1:25:27] world is doing we are a Nazarite unto
[1:25:30] the Lord amen as a husband and wife are
[1:25:33] one so is the Bride In Christ is one and
[1:25:36] the word of God lives through her and
[1:25:38] that's her real identity and that is her
[1:25:42] credentials so you see the only true
[1:25:45] credentials is that a Believer has is
[1:25:48] the word of God is living in them
[1:25:51] declaring that Jesus lives in them that
[1:25:55] person amen now so as we as we look
[1:25:59] about this we we want to remember that
[1:26:02] every promise of God is true and not One
[1:26:05] Word of Promise not one truth is to be
[1:26:10] shaved off we dare not let anyone know
[1:26:14] our secret or to lay in the lap of the
[1:26:17] world and shave off our
[1:26:19] power amen it seems that every church
[1:26:23] every move of God began with high
[1:26:27] aspirations they start out with the
[1:26:29] depth of God and that actual personal
[1:26:32] experience of the spirit of God dwelling
[1:26:35] in them where his mind is illuminated by
[1:26:39] the wisdom and knowledge of God through
[1:26:42] a fresh revelation of the word but
[1:26:45] lurking around is that attraction some
[1:26:48] Philistine girl some persuasion to make
[1:26:53] a sub stitute for this reality of God
[1:26:57] how does Satan do this he takes away the
[1:27:00] knowledge of the truth of God and
[1:27:03] destroys the word by putting for forth
[1:27:06] his own yeah hath God
[1:27:09] said so using quotes to fight quotes he
[1:27:13] makes the word of God
[1:27:17] ineffective amen for example the church
[1:27:20] started out strong and everybody knew
[1:27:24] knew to be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:27:26] Christ everybody knew
[1:27:29] it Peter did it with the keys on the day
[1:27:33] of
[1:27:35] Pentecost at the house of Cornelius they
[1:27:38] were baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:27:41] Jesus amen in later on in the scripture
[1:27:45] again at Samaria they were baptized in
[1:27:47] the name of the Lord Jesus in Acts
[1:27:50] chapter 19 they were commanded to be
[1:27:52] re-baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:27:54] Jesus Christ so everybody knew and
[1:27:58] that's how all the apostles baptized all
[1:28:01] the disciples believed in one
[1:28:04] God there's no was no such thing as
[1:28:11] trinitarians amen not until three
[1:28:14] centuries after the church when when got
[1:28:17] deceived by
[1:28:19] Delilah amen the word had come they
[1:28:22] rejoice in his truth
[1:28:25] But Then There Rose up factions who cut
[1:28:27] God into three and made a trinity of
[1:28:30] gods but originally
[1:28:33] everybody everybody knew to that to be
[1:28:38] baptized in his name when you're married
[1:28:41] you take on the name of your husband
[1:28:43] when you're born you take on the name of
[1:28:45] your father when you're born in the
[1:28:47] kingdom of God you take on the name of
[1:28:50] God Amen not a title but the name of God
[1:28:55] Amen your name isn't when you get
[1:28:57] married your name isn't husband you
[1:28:59] don't go take on the name husband you
[1:29:01] take on the name of whoever you
[1:29:04] married amen when you when you're born
[1:29:07] you don't take on the name of Father
[1:29:09] well well you know what what's the name
[1:29:11] what's his child's name father no his
[1:29:13] name isn't father he takes on the name
[1:29:15] of his of his father don't take on a
[1:29:19] title takes on his name everybody knew
[1:29:23] that to start out
[1:29:26] with everybody knew to be identified
[1:29:29] with Jesus Christ they also realize that
[1:29:32] salvation is not passed on by natural
[1:29:36] birth and let me just say to you again
[1:29:38] this morning you we cannot pass on the
[1:29:43] new birth just because you're born in
[1:29:46] the
[1:29:48] church so well I believe the message
[1:29:51] well so does the devil
[1:29:55] that's right amen no the new birth is an
[1:29:58] experience and everybody knew it was an
[1:30:02] experience amen nobody wondered at the
[1:30:05] birth of the church on the inauguration
[1:30:07] on the day of Pentecost nobody wondered
[1:30:11] did somebody come up and join the
[1:30:13] church did they shake hands with the
[1:30:15] pastor and say we're going to say the
[1:30:17] Apostles
[1:30:18] Creed did they come down to the Altar
[1:30:20] and say stick out your tongue we'll put
[1:30:22] a a wafer on it and the priest drink
[1:30:24] your wine did he do any of that no what
[1:30:28] happened on the day of Pentecost what
[1:30:29] happened an
[1:30:31] experience an experience of what the
[1:30:33] pillar of fire come gave a lick a
[1:30:36] portion gave birth that's right gave a
[1:30:39] lick of himself and came and dwelt in
[1:30:42] them so the nobody was confused about
[1:30:47] church
[1:30:48] joining or just being born into the
[1:30:51] church I was raised in the m so I
[1:30:54] believe
[1:30:55] it nobody had I got the Holy Ghost cuz I
[1:30:58] believe the message you don't have the
[1:31:00] Holy Ghost cuz you got to believe the
[1:31:01] message you get you have the Holy Ghost
[1:31:03] cuz he the person came down into you and
[1:31:09] burned out sin and made a child of God
[1:31:12] out of you that's how you believe the
[1:31:16] truth amen and that's how you're born
[1:31:19] again but you know we laid in the lap of
[1:31:21] Delilah and played with harlots until
[1:31:24] its thought because your parents raised
[1:31:26] you as a
[1:31:27] Believer and you embraced its thoughts
[1:31:30] that you just automatically feel with
[1:31:32] the
[1:31:33] spirit because you believe the
[1:31:35] fundamentals of the message and you'd
[1:31:38] receive the Holy Ghost the thought is
[1:31:40] that by natural birth you were born into
[1:31:42] the family of God and accepted in the
[1:31:44] church and that's why listen carefully
[1:31:48] that's why we have people who are
[1:31:52] unfamiliar with the super
[1:31:54] natural because they've been born
[1:31:56] without
[1:31:58] it nothing happened supernaturally when
[1:32:01] they were
[1:32:02] born I got born again nothing
[1:32:07] happened spirit of God came into me but
[1:32:10] nothing
[1:32:12] happened that's not the way it was in
[1:32:15] Acts
[1:32:17] 2 that's not the way when it originally
[1:32:19] come that's not the way at House of
[1:32:22] Cornelius that's not the way it was in
[1:32:24] Acts 19 there's no example in the
[1:32:28] scripture that anybody ever got the Holy
[1:32:30] Ghost and didn't know
[1:32:35] it you
[1:32:37] see you know so therefore you know when
[1:32:41] when when we have churches that come
[1:32:45] about I hesitate to say born but
[1:32:49] born and they were born without
[1:32:52] Supernatural then the gifts of the
[1:32:54] Spirit and the signs of the Supernatural
[1:32:57] are
[1:32:58] trivialized belittled and deemed as
[1:33:03] unnecessary altar calls become
[1:33:06] mocked prayer lines
[1:33:09] ridiculed amen casting out Devils
[1:33:13] replaced with psychology with man's
[1:33:16] reasoning of how to restrain wrong
[1:33:20] Behavior like Samson the church sought
[1:33:24] out strange women women not of the
[1:33:27] Covenant for comfort for consolation for
[1:33:31] company you see the seeds of unbelief
[1:33:33] start out small and innocent and it
[1:33:36] sounds good and reasonable like like
[1:33:39] taking John
[1:33:41] 14:12 and planted is only as in a
[1:33:44] prophet's Ministry and yet that truth
[1:33:48] became
[1:33:49] distorted because indeed it was a
[1:33:51] description of a prophetic Ministry yeah
[1:33:54] amen The Works of Jesus Christ worked in
[1:33:57] that Ministry amen we undeniably saw
[1:34:02] John 14:12 work in that Ministry we saw
[1:34:07] the ministry of Jesus Christ repeat as
[1:34:10] the son of man revealed himself and was
[1:34:12] identified among us but well don't we
[1:34:15] realize that Jesus said this not of
[1:34:18] himself but of the book of Acts that
[1:34:20] would
[1:34:21] follow amen and that William Brandon for
[1:34:24] example certainly lived out the ministry
[1:34:26] of Jesus Christ as we saw Jesus on
[1:34:30] display amen we and if we saw Jesus on
[1:34:34] display in brother Brandon's Ministry
[1:34:36] then that follows that there must be a
[1:34:39] book of Acts follow that Ministry that
[1:34:42] the same works that Jesus did through
[1:34:45] the prophetic Ministry works in the
[1:34:48] bride
[1:34:51] amen so look what he does he takes there
[1:34:54] with this smooth talk think of think of
[1:34:58] the Perfection that is Promised in 1
[1:35:00] Corinthians
[1:35:02] 13 that when that which is perfect has
[1:35:04] come then that which is in part is done
[1:35:08] away the Glorious Perfection brother
[1:35:11] that's a glorious
[1:35:12] Perfection which will one day be
[1:35:15] achieved by the
[1:35:17] church and it'll be in glorified
[1:35:20] bodies think of that amen where we will
[1:35:24] no longer need prophecy to know the
[1:35:28] future we will need no longer need to to
[1:35:32] know the future because there's no
[1:35:34] yesterdays or tomorrows
[1:35:37] there Amen in the Heaven's Perfection no
[1:35:39] one will uniquely speak in a Heavenly
[1:35:48] tongue think about that you know if if
[1:35:52] if unknown tongues to your ears that
[1:35:55] spoke in the church you automatically
[1:35:57] know that's speaking in tongues but when
[1:36:00] you go to heaven they ain't going to be
[1:36:02] you hearing speaking in tongues
[1:36:03] everybody will be speaking in
[1:36:07] tongues they will everyone be speaking
[1:36:11] in a Heavenly language they won't be
[1:36:13] speaking English and Dutch and Hebrew
[1:36:16] they'll be speaking in Heavenly
[1:36:19] language are you with me so all will
[1:36:22] speak with tongues so you see we will
[1:36:24] all have it'll never it won't be unique
[1:36:27] in heaven it's Unique here but it won't
[1:36:30] be unique there however while we're
[1:36:33] waiting for that glorified body of
[1:36:35] perfection as Immortals right now yet
[1:36:38] mortal and imperfect in truth we have we
[1:36:42] already have the perfect word by Divine
[1:36:45] in
[1:36:46] interpretation amen that and that should
[1:36:48] mean to us then that having just part of
[1:36:51] it is done away
[1:36:54] with and that no promise of God is
[1:36:59] excluded amen that means the word is not
[1:37:02] perfect and complete unless it has
[1:37:05] working of Miracles Gifts of healing
[1:37:08] faith and tongues and interpretation and
[1:37:11] prophecy it's not complete nor perfect
[1:37:14] in operation without Holy Spirit
[1:37:16] leadership of spiritual dreams and
[1:37:19] Visions that's but Samson the church
[1:37:24] has sunk down in the arms of a spirit
[1:37:27] who offers false
[1:37:30] Comfort she has but one aim and that is
[1:37:33] to take away your
[1:37:35] power like Delilah she Sues and she
[1:37:38] Comforts us for not having the
[1:37:41] supernatural working you know she
[1:37:43] Whispers In Your Ear you don't need
[1:37:48] it Samson you don't need the strength
[1:37:53] give give your strength to me you don't
[1:37:55] need it give me the secret of it give it
[1:38:00] up you have me and the deceiver wants to
[1:38:04] take prophecies and visions and means of
[1:38:08] God communicating his thought and plans
[1:38:11] to us and make them
[1:38:14] obsolete because he can replace it with
[1:38:17] a new way of just in elction the message
[1:38:20] and that now is the perfect way
[1:38:23] therefore the supernatural power is not
[1:38:25] needed anymore you see it's like the
[1:38:28] serpent saying yeath God
[1:38:30] said oh yeah God said the time will come
[1:38:35] when the church won't need its strength
[1:38:38] you you see you just have this concept
[1:38:41] of the word you you really don't need
[1:38:43] the strength you don't really need the
[1:38:46] power you you don't need your strength
[1:38:49] Samson give me your secret you you see
[1:38:53] you won't need you no longer need a
[1:38:56] Heavenly language of prayer where
[1:39:00] intercession is done through the spirit
[1:39:03] speaking things which cannot be
[1:39:05] uttered you won't need Divine Healing
[1:39:08] and laying on a hands and sick to follow
[1:39:11] those that believe every gift has now
[1:39:13] been laid on the
[1:39:14] shf and Delilah Whispers these words
[1:39:18] these sweet
[1:39:21] nothings like True Believers now listen
[1:39:25] Samson True Believers are without
[1:39:29] signs because we now have the
[1:39:32] word knowledge is all you
[1:39:35] need not
[1:39:37] power so lay your power down Samson just
[1:39:40] give it over to me
[1:39:42] relax lay your head in my lap and
[1:39:49] sleep you see the devil doesn't want our
[1:39:52] salvation to have
[1:39:55] power so he convinces the church you got
[1:39:58] salvation without
[1:40:01] power you're saved but you still
[1:40:06] fornicate you you're saved in the Holy
[1:40:09] Ghost filled got the token ready to go
[1:40:12] to heaven and you're still a porn
[1:40:15] addict you're saved but there is no
[1:40:18] prayer
[1:40:20] life no consecrated walk you see but no
[1:40:25] spiritual dreams or
[1:40:27] visions you you see never but never mind
[1:40:30] it it it just shows you you're
[1:40:33] perfect because you got great knowledge
[1:40:36] and the proof of you're so mature you're
[1:40:39] so grown
[1:40:40] up is because you don't need the
[1:40:45] Supernatural cuz grown-ups don't need
[1:40:48] those baby
[1:40:50] things see you look like a baby Samson
[1:40:53] with that
[1:40:55] hair you look like a mama's
[1:40:58] girl or Mama's
[1:41:01] Boy you know you don't need that you
[1:41:03] don't need speaking in tongue you don't
[1:41:05] need prophecy you don't need healings
[1:41:08] Miracles are only for the
[1:41:11] immature tongues are baby
[1:41:13] talk signs you don't need them you're
[1:41:16] wise what I have gives you great
[1:41:21] wisdom I say wake up
[1:41:25] Samson I say isn't Christ the
[1:41:29] same come on wasn't the apostolic age
[1:41:32] never to
[1:41:33] cease amen wasn't it for as many as our
[1:41:37] Lord God shall
[1:41:39] call wake up
[1:41:41] Samson amen the the world wants to take
[1:41:44] away your
[1:41:46] power no you don't need that strength
[1:41:49] you don't give it to me just give me
[1:41:50] your secret give up that hidden power
[1:41:53] power you see the days of that are
[1:41:57] passed since we have the word now the
[1:42:00] other is not needed it was only to
[1:42:02] vindicate a prophet that's all his
[1:42:04] ministry but once the word is Vindicated
[1:42:07] we don't need
[1:42:10] Vindication well well then what about
[1:42:12] the ministry of our Lord Jesus he
[1:42:14] brought the gospel and it was Vindicated
[1:42:17] how many can say he had a Vindicated
[1:42:19] Ministry God vindicating Jesus needed no
[1:42:23] further Vindication especially when he
[1:42:26] raised up over the over the out of the
[1:42:30] death into out of the Tomb you know
[1:42:33] Jesus need no further Vindication but
[1:42:36] true believers
[1:42:40] do Jesus don't need anymore but you
[1:42:44] do we don't have to have another sign to
[1:42:47] vindicate William brandham but you need
[1:42:51] Vindication amen True Believer
[1:42:53] because he said these signs
[1:42:56] shall follow them that believe and will
[1:42:59] vindicate them so you see this smooth
[1:43:03] talk it seems so
[1:43:06] inefficient just let you guard down lay
[1:43:09] your head in my lap like that Spirit of
[1:43:12] error that was allowed to grow in the
[1:43:14] Ephesian age and started as a seemingly
[1:43:18] in offensive seed of a tear and would
[1:43:22] choke out the wheat it's a seat of
[1:43:25] discrepancy so the church he wants to
[1:43:29] make you lukewarm formal cold and
[1:43:35] Powerless remember that's the whole
[1:43:37] thing he wants to take your power
[1:43:40] away somebody wants to try to add to the
[1:43:43] word or take from it you see you don't
[1:43:46] find those things in the prophet's
[1:43:48] message
[1:43:53] you don't see those things of no altar
[1:43:55] calls and no prayer
[1:43:57] lines you you you hear the prophet
[1:44:00] saying I want an
[1:44:02] oldfashioned alter call cuz God still
[1:44:04] works in
[1:44:06] them you don't hear the prophet saying
[1:44:08] those thing it's men who have taken with
[1:44:11] the spirit of Delilah to twist it to
[1:44:15] smooth talk you to take away your
[1:44:19] power cuz he don't want the power
[1:44:21] working in the church
[1:44:27] so it comes under cover with one little
[1:44:30] deviation from that word is a step away
[1:44:32] from Christ I want you to never forget
[1:44:36] your strength comes because of your
[1:44:40] Covenant between you and
[1:44:43] God it was made at your
[1:44:46] birth not so much your natural birth but
[1:44:49] through that through that which was
[1:44:52] pre-planned by God God Amen and so it's
[1:44:56] you are Covenant to him and Samson was
[1:44:58] God's deliverer for Israel his name was
[1:45:01] feared among the
[1:45:04] Philistines and so we ought to lift up
[1:45:07] the name of Jesus above our
[1:45:10] enemies amen they won't have nothing to
[1:45:13] fear if we don't use
[1:45:15] it amen there ought to be a church today
[1:45:18] on the rise that says we are the Samson
[1:45:21] of the Lord man and we have the name of
[1:45:24] Jesus that we're lifting and that name
[1:45:27] is feared by every demon power because
[1:45:30] in the name of Jesus Christ every demon
[1:45:33] has to P bow every Spirit has to flee
[1:45:37] Samson if he could just feel those Seven
[1:45:39] Locks he would know he was in the
[1:45:43] Covenant now Samson took a
[1:45:47] wife and was robbed of her and they gave
[1:45:50] her to another man
[1:45:53] now all of this happened so that he
[1:45:54] would have an occasion against the
[1:45:58] Philistines and Samson didn't found
[1:46:00] another occasion against the Philistines
[1:46:02] and and and they made him
[1:46:05] angry and I'll just tell you
[1:46:08] this I'd like to see the church get
[1:46:12] angry I'd like to see the church get
[1:46:15] angry when the devil steals our
[1:46:19] joy when the Devil comes and take away
[1:46:22] our PE
[1:46:24] I'd like to see the church get
[1:46:26] angry something rise up within them when
[1:46:30] we see the devil come in and and break
[1:46:32] apart marriages of young men and women
[1:46:35] and drag them out into the world I'd
[1:46:36] like to see people get
[1:46:39] angry angry enough to call Heaven down
[1:46:43] angry enough to rise up against sin and
[1:46:46] unrighteousness and rebuke it standing
[1:46:49] for truth
[1:46:53] I'd like to see the church
[1:46:55] angry I'd like to see an emotion rise of
[1:46:58] anger when the sick isn't
[1:47:01] healed God you made a promise I'm not
[1:47:04] angry at God but I'm angry at this
[1:47:06] stubborn devil that won't turn
[1:47:10] loose amen there needs to be somebody
[1:47:13] angry enough as brother Brandon one time
[1:47:16] yelled yelled there when he was casting
[1:47:18] out a devil he said now I'm not yelling
[1:47:20] at you but he said you know sometimes
[1:47:22] you just have to get mad at the Devil
[1:47:24] that's
[1:47:25] right and something Rises up in me I get
[1:47:29] a a letter from a little lady said I
[1:47:31] want to meet you brother Tim in Ohio
[1:47:34] when you're when you're there here in a
[1:47:35] few weeks I want to bring my daughter
[1:47:38] she she's possessed she got a terrible
[1:47:41] dis learning uh a learning disorder and
[1:47:45] she can't function and she's being
[1:47:47] bullied and everything else and she's so
[1:47:49] defeated and she's crying all the time I
[1:47:52] need some help I tell you what I get
[1:47:55] angry I think God what if that was my
[1:47:58] little girl what if that was my
[1:48:00] granddaughter what if that was my loved
[1:48:02] one when we hear of Elders being
[1:48:06] attacked by the devil when we hear of
[1:48:08] Ministers of the Gospel who have given
[1:48:11] their lives like brother Ron and there
[1:48:13] the devil is attacked him with a blow
[1:48:16] after blow after blow it ought to make a
[1:48:18] church angry
[1:48:25] angry enough to start tormenting
[1:48:28] Devils angry enough to start calling
[1:48:30] fire down out of Heaven angry enough to
[1:48:34] start moving against the powers of the
[1:48:36] of
[1:48:39] Darkness or the
[1:48:42] church oh that the church would once
[1:48:46] again make Satan
[1:48:49] tremble rather than trembling because of
[1:48:52] the
[1:48:55] devil the name Samson
[1:48:59] Samson that name would spark fear
[1:49:03] Samson's
[1:49:04] here that name would spark Terror in the
[1:49:09] hearts of the enemy Samson oh no
[1:49:12] Samson's
[1:49:16] come that's the way it ought to be with
[1:49:19] the Church of Jesus Christ she ought to
[1:49:22] spark Terror in the heart of Satan and
[1:49:27] all of his fallen angels in Hell there
[1:49:31] ought to be something rise up amen of
[1:49:33] fear within them you talk about us fear
[1:49:36] and and I see young people under the
[1:49:38] spirit of fear and the spirit of bondage
[1:49:40] let me tell you we ought to be making
[1:49:42] the devil the one to
[1:49:44] fear that he fears the Church of the
[1:49:47] Living God who realizes their power who
[1:49:50] realize their calling Who real eyes they
[1:49:53] have been sent in this last day to
[1:49:57] torment the

[1:51:03] have to ask
[1:51:05] him
[1:51:07] amen but nevertheless Samson Samson here
[1:51:12] he he went and caught 300
[1:51:16] foxes now I've heard of Trappers before
[1:51:20] but this was a Trapper
[1:51:23] and I don't know how he caught them all
[1:51:24] alive but he tied two of them tail to
[1:51:26] tail and put a fire brand on their tails
[1:51:29] and let them go through the Vil sign's
[1:51:30] corn and it burned up their shocks of
[1:51:32] corn their standing corn their Vineyards
[1:51:35] and their Olive Groves brother he did
[1:51:39] it he was
[1:51:41] angry he was enough angry that he
[1:51:44] actually tore down the Philistine
[1:51:47] Kingdom and took away their
[1:51:49] food I tell you what we ought to take
[1:51:51] away the things that are feeding the
[1:51:53] devil in our
[1:51:56] lives amen he went and caught three
[1:51:59] under foxes tied them together let them
[1:52:01] loose burn it up i' say burn up hell
[1:52:06] burn up sickness burn up unbelief burn
[1:52:09] up the spirits of Darkness we are the
[1:52:12] sons and daughters of the most high
[1:52:15] God the samsons called in this age
[1:52:23] Philistines came after Samson and
[1:52:27] Israel and guess what Israel turned
[1:52:29] against him ain't that about
[1:52:33] right here the here the Philistines come
[1:52:36] after Samson for burning up their corn
[1:52:38] burn you know setting their fields on
[1:52:39] fire so now they all gathered against
[1:52:43] them and they come up and say we want
[1:52:47] Samson and Israel says we'll give him to
[1:52:51] you now is that something here's a man
[1:52:54] who's standing there destroying their
[1:52:59] enemy and they want to take sides with
[1:53:01] the
[1:53:02] enemy is it something you preach Divine
[1:53:05] heal and the gifts of the Spirit and the
[1:53:07] moving of the Holy Ghost and people want
[1:53:09] to blast
[1:53:12] you amen they they they want to mock you
[1:53:15] and make fun of you they want they want
[1:53:16] to they want to join with the
[1:53:19] Enemy against the moving of the Holy
[1:53:22] Spirit
[1:53:23] you know so but you see Samson's People
[1:53:26] Israel betrayed him to the
[1:53:30] Philistines I tell you what that's an
[1:53:32] awful Judas when it comes from your own
[1:53:35] people that's what happened that's why
[1:53:37] Judas was so bad he came from jesus'
[1:53:39] Inner
[1:53:41] Circle amen the Judas was one of his own
[1:53:45] Deacon
[1:53:46] trustees one of the in the very Inner
[1:53:49] Circle in this biblical account of
[1:53:53] Samson you see Israel wanted peace at
[1:53:56] any
[1:53:58] cost they were content with false peace
[1:54:01] under
[1:54:02] Philistine dominion and they said to
[1:54:05] Samson knowest thou not that the
[1:54:09] Philistines are rulers over us how come
[1:54:16] Israel how come that ain't the Bible
[1:54:20] that ain't the promise of God that ain't
[1:54:23] what he was told by Joshua to do you go
[1:54:25] take the land and dispossess
[1:54:27] them amen you're to rule over them
[1:54:30] they're not to rule over you but Samson
[1:54:32] don't you know don't you know the
[1:54:34] Philistines are rulers over us how
[1:54:38] come how
[1:54:40] come are we happy with pornography
[1:54:43] ruling over our
[1:54:45] kids how come we're happy and satisfied
[1:54:50] to live with less than what God
[1:54:55] provided come on
[1:54:57] somebody amen why in the world isn't it
[1:55:01] amazing that many of God's people are
[1:55:03] content to be ruled by the
[1:55:07] Philistines they're too happy to be a
[1:55:09] slave to their lust to their flesh to
[1:55:11] the world to the
[1:55:14] devil God's people should want to be
[1:55:18] free it ought to burn in Freedom ought
[1:55:21] to burn in the hearts of of every not
[1:55:23] just Americans every child of God Amen
[1:55:26] they a freedom ought to burn in your
[1:55:29] heart amen we want God we want real
[1:55:33] peace because real peace and deliverance
[1:55:36] would come when the church like Samson
[1:55:39] fulfilled God's plan to deliver Israel
[1:55:42] from the Philistine rule but instead all
[1:55:45] of a
[1:55:46] sudden all of us said well you've done
[1:55:48] broke Church order you've done this
[1:55:50] you've done that and so you know they
[1:55:53] bound
[1:55:56] him they bound
[1:55:58] him you
[1:56:00] see there can only be peace real peace
[1:56:04] in the
[1:56:05] land when the
[1:56:07] church is
[1:56:10] Victorious our Victory is through the
[1:56:13] Lord Jesus Christ there is no Victory
[1:56:16] otherwise he is our peace don't settle
[1:56:18] for a false peace don't compromise with
[1:56:21] the Enemy
[1:56:23] don't surrender your faith as Israel
[1:56:25] surrendered Samson to the Philistines
[1:56:28] don't surrender your
[1:56:29] hope don't let the devil steal your
[1:56:33] health amen don't let him take your
[1:56:35] peace or your
[1:56:37] joy amen don't lay down your
[1:56:40] Bible don't swap God's word for
[1:56:43] something
[1:56:44] inferior amen don't settle for anything
[1:56:47] less than the Lord Jesus Christ and for
[1:56:50] every promise of his
[1:56:53] look the land is ours it is Satan that
[1:56:56] is the
[1:56:57] Invader do you hear me don't give up
[1:57:00] your land to the enemy there you know
[1:57:03] even even today there is no such thing
[1:57:07] as a Palestine that's right there's a
[1:57:10] place called
[1:57:13] Israel amen there's no such thing as
[1:57:15] Palestinians just
[1:57:17] Arabs Arabs who are Invaders who want to
[1:57:20] steal the land of promise from
[1:57:23] God's people who are the legal owner
[1:57:26] that's
[1:57:28] right amen the president of Israel just
[1:57:31] said recently in his Memorial Day speech
[1:57:35] we never forget that there is no greater
[1:57:39] commandment than redeeming
[1:57:42] captives think of that no greater
[1:57:47] commandment than redeeming captives that
[1:57:50] ought to be the motto of the
[1:57:53] church no greater
[1:57:55] commandment like I said you know that
[1:57:58] every Church ought to cast out
[1:58:02] Devils amen we should cast them out out
[1:58:06] of lives out of hearts for salvation to
[1:58:09] come it comes by casting out
[1:58:12] Devils come on somebody amen and there's
[1:58:15] no greater commandment than redeeming
[1:58:18] captives the entire nation is with you
[1:58:20] we must Summit summon courage and choose
[1:58:23] life not to rest not to stop until they
[1:58:27] all return home and I say how can we
[1:58:31] forget those who are
[1:58:34] captive how can we forget those who are
[1:58:37] captive by
[1:58:39] cancer a hostage with horrible
[1:58:43] struggles how can we forget those that
[1:58:46] are
[1:58:48] bound
[1:58:50] tormented sick or
[1:58:53] lame how can we forget all of those that
[1:58:57] are being held
[1:58:58] hostage I think I think there in the
[1:59:02] Bible in in Isaiah 61 where the Bible
[1:59:05] said he came to set the captive free and
[1:59:09] he did it by opening the eyes of the
[1:59:11] Blind by Healing The
[1:59:14] Sick amen from delivering from those who
[1:59:17] were in prison and and setting people
[1:59:19] free let me tell you when you have
[1:59:22] salvation in a church it's setting
[1:59:25] captives free salvation can be on the
[1:59:28] body realm or the spirit realm amen
[1:59:30] whatever it is it's it is setting the
[1:59:33] captive free it should be our highest
[1:59:36] calling no greater Commandment that set
[1:59:39] captives
[1:59:41] free so how can we
[1:59:44] forget how can we forget it's time to
[1:59:47] set captives free the world wants us
[1:59:50] wants to keep us from rough
[1:59:53] those demonic strongholds of unbelief
[1:59:55] that's what the devil wants to do he
[1:59:58] wants he don't want us hunting down
[2:00:00] those demons that are holding our people
[2:00:02] captive and destroying and and and
[2:00:05] destroying our our
[2:00:07] friends they want they want they don't
[2:00:10] want
[2:00:11] us they don't want us destroying the
[2:00:13] enemy they want him to live to fight
[2:00:15] another
[2:00:17] day and I just tell you like Samson
[2:00:20] sometimes you have to stand
[2:00:23] alone Samson was alone and you may be
[2:00:26] standing alone today you you may have
[2:00:28] battles and struggles and difficulties
[2:00:30] like Samson did and Samson was just a
[2:00:33] fallible human being like every one of
[2:00:36] us but let me tell you the key is not in
[2:00:38] yourself the key is not in your power
[2:00:40] your strength but it's in putting forth
[2:00:43] your hand and taking the Jawbone of an
[2:00:48] ass that doky that Jawbone that God Prov
[2:00:53] fighted here he was now 3,000 men of
[2:00:58] Judah came and bound
[2:01:01] him and a thousand men of the
[2:01:04] Philistines come to take
[2:01:09] him took 3,000 to bind him and 1,000
[2:01:13] Philistines thought they would liberate
[2:01:15] him I and take him I
[2:01:18] mean hold him captive
[2:01:24] and Samson took him burst those
[2:01:26] bands and he steps out and he looks and
[2:01:30] he has no
[2:01:32] weapon and he looks down and he sees a
[2:01:40] Jawbone I want you to think of this
[2:01:43] because we can all identify with Samson
[2:01:45] one way or the other capable of such
[2:01:49] strength yet such weakness
[2:01:52] Victorious One Moment defeated the next
[2:01:56] it's a true picture of the church
[2:01:58] Victorious and defeated the cycle of
[2:02:00] Revival and death has never failed but
[2:02:03] somebody's got to defeat the
[2:02:05] enemy and the Bible said in judges 1515
[2:02:08] he found a new jaw bone of an ass and
[2:02:12] put forth his hand and took it and slew
[2:02:14] a thousand men with
[2:02:18] it I don't know when the first man got
[2:02:21] killed with it why they didn't all start
[2:02:23] running and especially the dummies after
[2:02:26] 10 20 30 40
[2:02:28] 50 a Jawbone how in the world would you
[2:02:31] face a thousand men armed in dangerous
[2:02:34] with a
[2:02:36] Jawbone Samson faces a thousand
[2:02:39] Philistine on his own without Israel's
[2:02:43] help and he prevailed using something
[2:02:46] that
[2:02:47] is a humble almost seemingly stupid
[2:02:59] weapon this is more than a neat story of
[2:03:02] a
[2:03:05] superhero this is a
[2:03:07] prophecy this is speaking of the church
[2:03:11] it's talking about the hidden power of
[2:03:13] God it's talking about what lays in your
[2:03:18] hands it's talking about a feeble what
[2:03:21] seem ly is a feeble
[2:03:23] weapon but in the hand of a man of
[2:03:27] God Amen under the strength of God can
[2:03:30] defeat the enemy taking the word of God
[2:03:33] and defeating the enemy anywhere any
[2:03:35] place at any
[2:03:37] time amen you see our prayers also seem
[2:03:42] weak and feeble against demon
[2:03:47] powers they look weak when they spoke
[2:03:49] against demon cancers
[2:03:52] the word of God looks fragile against
[2:03:54] modern science the jawbones seemingly
[2:03:58] would shatter with Splinter or break
[2:04:01] apart in the face of
[2:04:03] critics but the weapons of God that God
[2:04:06] provides they they many times look
[2:04:09] ridiculous to the human
[2:04:11] mind you know it was Moses that had a
[2:04:14] staff in his
[2:04:16] hands riding on a mule or a donkey
[2:04:19] heading back to Egypt
[2:04:22] with a staff in his hand and he would
[2:04:25] take said Moses what are you doing I'm
[2:04:26] going to go and defeat the mightiest
[2:04:29] army in the world what are you going to
[2:04:32] use this
[2:04:36] Rod come on shamgar had an ox goat which
[2:04:41] which he killed 600
[2:04:44] Philistines Samson had a Jawbone and
[2:04:48] slew a thousand
[2:04:50] Philistines David had a
[2:04:53] sling a
[2:04:55] string with a piece of leather and a
[2:04:58] stone that he killed a mighty Giant
[2:05:01] Goliath
[2:05:04] with you see that's what it is that
[2:05:07] where you see a Jawbone what about it
[2:05:09] what about that jaw bone the Jawbone
[2:05:11] represents any promise of the word of
[2:05:13] God it represents Jesus The Living Word
[2:05:17] the Bible the written word our victory
[2:05:20] over the pH in our lives come when we
[2:05:23] use the
[2:05:26] Jawbone of a donkey to defeat them these
[2:05:30] things look
[2:05:32] insignificant until it's wielded in the
[2:05:35] hand of
[2:05:37] Faith the Jawbone of Promise is
[2:05:40] ineffective against those who dominate
[2:05:43] us even those besetting sins the Bible
[2:05:48] tells you in Ephesians 6:12 we wrestle
[2:05:51] not against against flesh and blood but
[2:05:53] against rulers against principalities
[2:05:56] against Powers against the rulers of the
[2:05:58] darkness of this world against spiritual
[2:06:01] wickedness in high places and we got the
[2:06:04] victory we got the Jawbone but we have
[2:06:07] to take our hand take it in our
[2:06:11] hands you're surrounded by a thousand
[2:06:15] Philistines but there is a job on there
[2:06:18] don't don't disregard
[2:06:20] it you got the most powerful weapons
[2:06:23] there is right at your
[2:06:26] disposal amen you've got prayer and
[2:06:28] you've got the word of God Amen you you
[2:06:32] may know the message of the Bible but
[2:06:34] unless you take what it's saying and lay
[2:06:36] hold on it somebody somebody's got to
[2:06:39] take hold of a
[2:06:40] promise somebody's got to take hold of
[2:06:43] Mark 16 somebody's got to take a hold of
[2:06:46] John 14:12 somebody got to say the
[2:06:49] spirit of God's in the bride of Christ
[2:06:51] and she knows what to do with the word
[2:06:55] somebody's got to take a hold of
[2:06:58] it the jaw bones laying there is for you
[2:07:01] to take a hold
[2:07:03] of it's a promise laying there in the
[2:07:08] word what is it is it a heart belief or
[2:07:11] a head belief is it a head knowledge
[2:07:13] that even Devils have or do we have a
[2:07:16] heart
[2:07:17] knowledge have we as our hearts been
[2:07:19] turned back to Faith again somebody's
[2:07:22] got to realize we are the Malachi four
[2:07:25] Believers whose Hearts have been
[2:07:27] restored back to the faith of the
[2:07:29] fathers somebody got to stand up for
[2:07:31] righteousness in this day and call Sin
[2:07:34] Sin and wrong wrong and right right
[2:07:36] somebody's got to stand for truth
[2:07:39] somebody's got to take a hold of the job
[2:07:41] B that's right it may look ridiculous it
[2:07:44] may look stupid it may look it may me
[2:07:46] look crazy but somebody's got to be
[2:07:48] crazy for
[2:07:50] God most was crazy for God going down to
[2:07:53] Egypt with a
[2:07:54] stick amen David was crazy for God going
[2:07:58] out with a slingshot amen you got to be
[2:08:01] crazy for God come on taking any promise
[2:08:04] of the word and and taking against the
[2:08:06] the heart of the
[2:08:09] enemy the Jawbone represented God's
[2:08:12] appointed weapon and I'll tell you God
[2:08:15] gave us a weapon it's the message of the
[2:08:19] hour amen the Bible said Samson found
[2:08:23] it it was crude rude let me say
[2:08:27] sometimes it came in Kentucky
[2:08:30] English but God provided
[2:08:32] it amen we're predestinated to it and
[2:08:36] like Samson we just have to take
[2:08:40] it take it Samson didn't refuse it he he
[2:08:45] saw the Seas this JW bone and put forth
[2:08:48] his hand and took it just like we do we
[2:08:50] we have to take it forth with our hand
[2:08:52] put forth our hand and take hold of our
[2:08:54] deliverance we have to receive what God
[2:08:56] has done for
[2:09:00] us amen those of you seeking the spirit
[2:09:04] of God you know there again you can cry
[2:09:07] day and night and day and night until
[2:09:09] I'm old and totally feeble but you got
[2:09:12] to take
[2:09:14] it you got to take the Word of Promise
[2:09:17] You cannot just say oh well it's there
[2:09:20] you must say it it's
[2:09:22] mine if it's Divine Healing you must say
[2:09:25] it's
[2:09:26] mine amen if it's a struggle that you
[2:09:29] have in the world with the lust of the
[2:09:30] flesh or the lust of the eye or the
[2:09:32] pride of life you got to say I've got a
[2:09:35] a
[2:09:36] weapon I am not
[2:09:39] defenseless but I've got a weapon amen I
[2:09:42] want victory in my life over Satan the
[2:09:45] World the Flesh then I'm taking putting
[2:09:48] forth my hand and I'm taking the word of
[2:09:50] God and I'm saying it's mine it's mine
[2:09:53] to defeat the enemy with and I know if I
[2:09:57] pray according to the word I'm praying
[2:09:58] according to his will and I'll have
[2:10:00] answered
[2:10:02] prayer it's the word yes sir you say
[2:10:05] well brother Tim how do we pray with the
[2:10:06] word well it's the word I would that
[2:10:08] you'd prosper in health as your soul
[2:10:10] prospers that's the word it's the word
[2:10:13] that he is our peace it's the word that
[2:10:15] he will Champion our
[2:10:17] cause amen did you did you notice the
[2:10:22] jaw bone was
[2:10:27] new you know brother Bram always
[2:10:30] referring to the Jawbone we say it's an
[2:10:32] old
[2:10:34] Jawbone was he de disagreeing with the
[2:10:36] Bible no I don't think he
[2:10:39] was I'm saying I think it was old in
[2:10:43] that the promises are
[2:10:45] Eternal and from
[2:10:47] Everlasting but when we pick them up
[2:10:51] they are
[2:10:54] new pick up that new jaw
[2:10:58] bom let the word become flesh and
[2:11:01] anointed to you the Bible said he would
[2:11:04] give us the sure mercies of
[2:11:07] David you see they were old mercies but
[2:11:11] when given to us they are new
[2:11:14] mercies come on the mercies of David are
[2:11:19] old but when they're given to you
[2:11:21] they're new so what does it mean a new
[2:11:24] Jawbone it's kind of like the Mana that
[2:11:27] was fresh every
[2:11:29] day the Jawbone the word of God is
[2:11:32] living and written is always flesh is
[2:11:34] always alive because Jesus is
[2:11:38] Alive and his body didn't corrupt in the
[2:11:40] Tomb and he raised from the dead and he
[2:11:42] passed in the heavens and he seated at
[2:11:44] the right hand of God and and the words
[2:11:46] of Jesus never get stale that's right
[2:11:50] amen
[2:11:54] the Bible tells us in of Israel in
[2:11:57] numbers
[2:11:59] 21 how that they spoke against God and
[2:12:04] against
[2:12:05] Moses saying why have you brought us out
[2:12:07] of Egypt to die in the wilderness here
[2:12:10] there's no bread there's no water and
[2:12:13] our soul
[2:12:16] loatheth this light
[2:12:19] bread this angel food
[2:12:22] this Mana from heaven was new every
[2:12:24] morning but it had become old to
[2:12:28] them I'm taking examples even this
[2:12:31] morning I'm taking examples and promises
[2:12:34] that are old an ancient story of a man
[2:12:37] by the name of Samson and bringing to
[2:12:40] you them
[2:12:43] fresh this morning old mercies the
[2:12:46] mercies of David the mercies of Abraham
[2:12:48] the mercies of Jesus become new
[2:12:51] every morning when taken in the hand of
[2:12:55] faith I wonder sometimes are we weary of
[2:12:58] the Mana of God's word or you know
[2:13:00] Wednesday night and and then back to
[2:13:02] church Sunday and I've heard that before
[2:13:04] and I you know I just read Facebook
[2:13:06] forget the old book of the Bible and
[2:13:08] you're too bound up with daily life to
[2:13:10] read
[2:13:12] it I I say shed shred those bounds and
[2:13:17] find something new the things that had
[2:13:20] bound s and he had to shred them and
[2:13:24] reach down to something new it was it
[2:13:27] was a new job
[2:13:29] B you know maybe you should just get
[2:13:33] right with
[2:13:34] God maybe you've fallen out of
[2:13:36] fellowship with him maybe because of
[2:13:38] some unconfessed sin that's separating
[2:13:40] you from your God you have forgotten
[2:13:42] where your power comes from maybe you've
[2:13:45] lost your first love and God calls for
[2:13:47] repentance you should ask for it and God
[2:13:50] is faith ful to forgive and to cleanse
[2:13:52] us from all unrighteousness and his word
[2:13:54] is life to the believer and God's word
[2:13:57] is a living oh is living
[2:14:00] water in Psalms
[2:14:03] 46 it says there is a
[2:14:06] river and the streams whereof shall make
[2:14:10] glad the city of God the holy place of
[2:14:14] the
[2:14:15] Tabernacles of the most high so you see
[2:14:18] we are the we are the city of God we are
[2:14:22] the Tabernacles of the most high the
[2:14:25] spirit of God dwells in us who have been
[2:14:28] really born
[2:14:29] again and I just say never ever stray
[2:14:32] from that River Jesus is the source when
[2:14:35] you leave Jesus you leave the source
[2:14:38] when you leave the Holy Spirit when he's
[2:14:41] no longer in the life when he's no
[2:14:43] longer in the church when he's no longer
[2:14:45] in the songs when he's no longer in the
[2:14:47] preaching we've lost everything
[2:14:53] Jeremiah 2:13 said my people have Comm
[2:14:56] committed two evils they have forsaken
[2:14:58] me the Fountain of Living Water and
[2:15:01] they've shwed Out Sister broken sistens
[2:15:03] that can hold no water you know too many
[2:15:06] worship god of their own
[2:15:08] imagination a Jesus of their own
[2:15:11] creation a Jesus that will excuse you of
[2:15:14] sin and a sinful lifestyle that
[2:15:18] justifies your Li Your Lust and your
[2:15:20] your covetousness your greed and your
[2:15:22] envy and the Bible speaks about another
[2:15:26] Jesus another gospel and I wonder today
[2:15:30] have we as a church forsaken the gospel
[2:15:34] the true Gospel of the Lord
[2:15:37] Jesus and he heed out their own
[2:15:41] sisters and this is exactly the
[2:15:43] indictment that came from the prophet of
[2:15:45] God they are broken sisters that hold no
[2:15:49] water
[2:15:51] but you see he tells you return to the
[2:15:54] Fountain of Living Water yes sir amen
[2:15:58] think about that Jawbone as we type it
[2:16:00] with the written word of God God's word
[2:16:03] the Bible is a the Jawbone may seem
[2:16:05] stupid and and and offensive to Samson
[2:16:09] and so the Bible will seem stupid and
[2:16:11] offensive to so many it's foolishness
[2:16:14] the Bible said the preaching of the
[2:16:16] Cross is foolishness to the unbeliever
[2:16:19] but to us it's the power of
[2:16:23] God hey man here they look down whip us
[2:16:26] with what a stupid J come on get real
[2:16:30] Samson he was for
[2:16:33] real amen he was for real there he
[2:16:37] reached down and gets this Jawbone
[2:16:40] something that seems impossible but all
[2:16:43] things are possible to them that believe
[2:16:46] oh if we could get the church believe
[2:16:49] it nothing would stand before our
[2:16:51] prayers if we get to church believing
[2:16:55] act two happens again amen if we get to
[2:16:58] church beli the spirit of God begins to
[2:17:01] move out doubt fear unbelief darkness
[2:17:03] and demons go to running when the church
[2:17:07] begins to
[2:17:08] believe the Jawbone was from a donkey
[2:17:11] you know the donkey is an humble simple
[2:17:14] servant animal it's
[2:17:17] taken for
[2:17:19] granted like being so reliable and able
[2:17:22] to carry so many burdens they use them
[2:17:24] over in the
[2:17:27] East over there one day there was a
[2:17:30] Prophet by the name of
[2:17:34] balum and there was a donkey that saved
[2:17:36] his
[2:17:38] life he was a greedy prophet he was on
[2:17:41] his way down to curse
[2:17:43] Israel Bayo was paying him lots of
[2:17:48] money and on his way he would have
[2:17:52] died but God opened the mouth of his
[2:17:55] donkey which he was Mercy beating him
[2:18:00] and it stopped and the donkey donkey
[2:18:03] stopped right in the way and fell down
[2:18:06] because it saw the angel of the Lord
[2:18:08] with his sword drawn standing the way
[2:18:11] and Bam couldn't see it his eye was too
[2:18:14] much on the success he was going to have
[2:18:17] and the money that he would get and the
[2:18:19] the price he was being given and God
[2:18:22] opened a donkey's
[2:18:24] mouth and the Bible said that dumb
[2:18:27] donkey rebuked balum for his
[2:18:31] Madness the donkey saw the angel of Lord
[2:18:34] while balam could not see because of all
[2:18:36] of his greed and the donkey spoke the
[2:18:41] truth she had been loyal to balam all
[2:18:43] his life and the donkey saved the about
[2:18:45] balam's life and and and got for the
[2:18:50] wrath of his
[2:18:52] anchor let me tell you God's word is the
[2:18:56] Jawbone of a
[2:18:57] donkey don't take the donkey for for
[2:19:00] granted like balum did the donkey does a
[2:19:04] lot for you and you may not realize it
[2:19:07] God's word saves us from
[2:19:09] death God's word speaks the truth God's
[2:19:13] word is faithful and loyal God's word
[2:19:16] Bears the ridicule the scoffing the
[2:19:18] mockery God's word is humble
[2:19:22] and God's word Bears witness of Jesus
[2:19:25] Christ who himself took on the form of a
[2:19:29] servant and bear our sins in his own
[2:19:31] body on a tree Who Bore the sins of the
[2:19:35] world and by whose stripes we are
[2:19:39] healed think about
[2:19:42] that we have the truth today and the
[2:19:44] truth has always been persecuted this
[2:19:46] message is always unwelcome it's a it's
[2:19:50] it's
[2:19:51] it's light rejected and yet it carries
[2:19:54] such Authority it it gives such
[2:19:58] Victory and and the it's it is our faith
[2:20:01] in the word of God that gives us victory
[2:20:03] over the world it's there we forsake our
[2:20:06] opinions we forsake our thoughts our
[2:20:09] imaginations our devices our and we
[2:20:11] submit to God's humble
[2:20:14] word and we fall at his feet is dead
[2:20:18] realizing how worthless the praed and
[2:20:21] incapable we
[2:20:23] are the
[2:20:25] donkey the donkey the job on a donkey
[2:20:29] will save your
[2:20:31] life it's God's
[2:20:33] word it saved balam's it save Samson
[2:20:38] it'll save
[2:20:41] you I'm telling you the word of God will
[2:20:44] save you the word of God sees like the
[2:20:47] donkey sees what we don't see it reveals
[2:20:50] what we can't see is a mouthpiece for
[2:20:52] God it carries God's message and when we
[2:20:55] read it it's God's word to
[2:20:57] us amen it's the written word but you
[2:21:00] got to take
[2:21:01] it it looks old but it's
[2:21:06] new amen it's from
[2:21:08] Everlasting it's ageless but when you
[2:21:11] take it it's
[2:21:13] new it's new Mercy this new word it's a
[2:21:17] word there against your enemy that you
[2:21:20] can take
[2:21:22] today but you know what
[2:21:27] Samson after he finished fighting his
[2:21:31] enemy you know what he
[2:21:34] did he threw the job on his
[2:21:41] side
[2:21:47] Victorious thousand
[2:21:50] he writes a poem about his victory you
[2:21:52] can read it in the
[2:21:55] Bible he writes a poem about it and he
[2:21:59] forgot it was the spirit of the Lord and
[2:22:02] the provision of a job bone that had
[2:22:05] given him the
[2:22:08] victory he Cast Away the job on
[2:22:12] thinking I'm done with
[2:22:17] it and the Bible said immediately he he
[2:22:20] was sore of thirst
[2:22:23] that's I I'll tell you what friends you
[2:22:26] never need to throw away the jaw
[2:22:29] bone amen you you may have a great
[2:22:32] victory in your life and be victorious
[2:22:34] but it wasn't
[2:22:36] you you didn't defeat cigarettes you
[2:22:40] didn't defeat that alcohol you didn't
[2:22:42] defeat that porn you didn't Fe come on
[2:22:46] you didn't Fe defeat that fornication
[2:22:48] and that adulterous Spirit you didn't do
[2:22:50] it he did it we got to remember where
[2:22:54] our strength came
[2:22:59] from but he threw it
[2:23:02] away he's done with it well I've had my
[2:23:06] victory I'm a Christian
[2:23:08] now I'm a
[2:23:10] Believer look at all the GI the giants
[2:23:13] look at all the Philistines I killed I
[2:23:16] don't need it and the Bible said
[2:23:20] he was sore at thirst let me tell you
[2:23:23] there's never a time we're done with the
[2:23:29] word we are never independent of
[2:23:33] God we need him every
[2:23:38] moment he is strong when we are
[2:23:42] weak the Jawbone was a source of Living
[2:23:45] Water oh yes and so is Jesus amen he's a
[2:23:51] source of Living Water oh I remember him
[2:23:54] standing there you know sometimes when
[2:23:56] Jesus preached he was quiet and he
[2:23:59] taught other times he
[2:24:02] preached and when he did he screamed out
[2:24:05] and
[2:24:06] said If any man thirst let him come to
[2:24:10] me and
[2:24:13] drink he is the thirst quencher for the
[2:24:16] Thirsty
[2:24:17] Soul you see the soul there that is deep
[2:24:21] in sin and and doing every kind of wrong
[2:24:23] things why they're doing it because
[2:24:25] they're
[2:24:26] thirsty thirsty human beings trying to
[2:24:30] satisfied with the world with sin with
[2:24:32] the with
[2:24:34] Darkness they're
[2:24:36] thirsty but God comes and he's The
[2:24:39] Thirst
[2:24:41] quencher but how easily we cast the
[2:24:43] Jawbone away in the moment we get
[2:24:45] Victory is easy to forget we get so
[2:24:48] proud of ourselves
[2:24:51] we don't you know people get so proud
[2:24:52] they don't need
[2:24:55] Church they get so proud they don't need
[2:24:57] a pastor no
[2:24:59] more they don't even need other
[2:25:02] Christians pride is so
[2:25:05] stupid pride is so deceitful it raises
[2:25:08] up its ugly head in so many way it's
[2:25:09] just hard for people to let it
[2:25:12] go we have nothing and we are nothing
[2:25:15] just like Samson was Samson's an
[2:25:18] ordinary man
[2:25:20] he has no
[2:25:22] superpowers he had no big muscles he
[2:25:24] didn't have shoulders like a barn he was
[2:25:26] a whiy little
[2:25:27] kid curly-headed
[2:25:30] shrimp a nothing you're nobody you're
[2:25:35] nothing and this the way Samson was he
[2:25:38] had no power on his own it was when the
[2:25:41] spirit of the Lord came upon him don't
[2:25:44] we realize church that's the way it is
[2:25:48] unless the spirit comes what good does
[2:25:51] it do to even assemble unless the spirit
[2:25:54] comes what does it do to sing the
[2:25:56] fanciest song and play the most
[2:25:58] beautiful music unless the spirit
[2:26:03] comes amen we got to have him that's
[2:26:07] what about your own life you may claim
[2:26:09] oh I'm a Believer I tell you I've been
[2:26:11] in many many years but without the
[2:26:15] spirit lukewarm cold and
[2:26:18] Powerless what is the church oh we're
[2:26:21] we're mess we received the mightiest
[2:26:23] message the greatest word I tell but
[2:26:25] without the
[2:26:27] spirit what's it going to
[2:26:30] do so you see he had no Spirit no
[2:26:33] superpowers he had no
[2:26:37] strength except by the
[2:26:40] spirit so don't Cast Away your
[2:26:44] confidence don't Cast Away Your
[2:26:46] god-given
[2:26:48] Weapon It's also the source of Living
[2:26:52] Water the words are living water why why
[2:26:55] am I saying this because when when this
[2:26:58] happened here you know Samson after
[2:27:01] fighting this battle he became so
[2:27:04] thirsty and he was about to
[2:27:07] die and he cried out to God and God
[2:27:10] opened up a hollow in the
[2:27:13] Jawbone and out of there came
[2:27:17] water and it revived his thirsty soul
[2:27:21] I'll tell you that's exactly what it is
[2:27:23] in the
[2:27:24] promises don't cast it away because
[2:27:27] you're going to need it to revive
[2:27:30] yourself to get strength again to go on
[2:27:33] to fight another
[2:27:36] battle amen drink from it Jesus
[2:27:39] commanded us to keep his word to keep
[2:27:41] his
[2:27:45] Commandments both to obey them
[2:27:47] physically and spiritually and we're not
[2:27:49] just
[2:27:50] surrender the sword of the spirit we're
[2:27:53] not surrender the
[2:27:54] word and God caved a hollow in the
[2:28:00] gelon say well brother
[2:28:03] Tim we're great message
[2:28:06] Believers we don't need
[2:28:08] refreshing we don't need
[2:28:10] Revival we don't need nothing from the
[2:28:13] presence of God we got it all we've
[2:28:15] received it I'll tell you what you know
[2:28:17] we we are
[2:28:18] mature and anointed people that are you
[2:28:22] know with Anointed with this great
[2:28:24] knowledge that we have
[2:28:27] received we don't need
[2:28:30] refreshing I tell you what we can go out
[2:28:32] and fight devils and we're strong as
[2:28:34] ever oh
[2:28:36] really Jesus needed
[2:28:40] refreshing after he faced the devil on
[2:28:42] the Mount of Temptation the Bible said
[2:28:44] Angels Came and strengthened
[2:28:46] him I'll tell you what that's what we
[2:28:49] need today
[2:28:50] we need the Heavens to open we've been
[2:28:53] in a great battle against the God of
[2:28:55] this evil age and we need the heavens
[2:28:58] are open and angels to send and descend
[2:29:01] upon the son of man and the and the
[2:29:03] glory of God to come down and stength in
[2:29:08] us it was Elijah when he got under a
[2:29:11] juniper tree he had had a great Victory
[2:29:14] and then ran for his life and was found
[2:29:17] under a juniper tree and it was there in
[2:29:20] that place that an angel refreshed
[2:29:23] him is it time we get a
[2:29:26] refreshing any it time we're the church
[2:29:29] we may be Samson we may be strong we may
[2:29:32] do the do the Lord's battles we we may
[2:29:34] have had great victories but we need a
[2:29:38] refreshing I'm looking at men and women
[2:29:40] that I know are stward Christians but I
[2:29:42] also know they need a
[2:29:44] refreshing I know they need to take the
[2:29:46] very thing that they slew the enemy with
[2:29:49] and be refreshed and a fresh eye pouring
[2:29:53] of the Holy Ghost come down upon them
[2:29:55] and make them alive in the spirit of God
[2:29:58] once
[2:30:01] again Samson was so thirsty of famished
[2:30:04] about to die but it thrown away what he
[2:30:07] just
[2:30:08] needed I think about
[2:30:11] Jesus Jesus is one who life given water
[2:30:14] came from when he was pierced and from
[2:30:17] his side and blood and water came forth
[2:30:20] from him and said my God my God why has
[2:30:22] I forsaken me what was that that was the
[2:30:26] shepherd being
[2:30:27] smitten that was the one who was given
[2:30:30] his life for the sins of the world where
[2:30:32] he would abolish the the sacrificial
[2:30:35] systems in the sacrifice of
[2:30:38] himself and as a perfect sinless
[2:30:40] sacrifice for sins uh uh there he
[2:30:44] enabled the the Waters of life to flow
[2:30:48] freely and everything we are and all the
[2:30:53] strength we have is because what he did
[2:30:57] that's why we must never forget
[2:31:03] Calvary the fountain was open that day
[2:31:06] at Calvary and it washes away our sins
[2:31:08] it saves us and keeps us
[2:31:10] clean for
[2:31:12] Samson that
[2:31:14] Jon was both an instrument of death and
[2:31:17] an instrument of
[2:31:18] life so is what we
[2:31:21] have what will you do with this Jesus
[2:31:24] called
[2:31:25] Christ for
[2:31:27] some it carries a message of judgment
[2:31:30] and
[2:31:31] condemnation but for others that will
[2:31:34] take it it's the good
[2:31:37] news amen it's life to everyone we ought
[2:31:40] to take forth our hand this morning and
[2:31:43] take a hold of the
[2:31:45] promise here here again in this great
[2:31:50] Victory we ought to stand today and say
[2:31:53] it doesn't really matter how much the
[2:31:55] devil has beat us down with every kind
[2:31:57] of
[2:31:58] sickness we take the promise of the word
[2:32:01] of God and say that we believe and and
[2:32:03] we hold on to that promise and when we
[2:32:06] pray we present the token with our
[2:32:09] prayer amen this this token is a
[2:32:12] powerful weapon it's the holy ghost that
[2:32:15] you have to present that I am a blood
[2:32:18] wash bloodb son of the daughter of the
[2:32:21] Living God Amen if Satan tries to hand
[2:32:24] you something like sickness you just
[2:32:27] take your token and apply
[2:32:29] it but you know
[2:32:31] Samson Samson kepts
[2:32:34] playing with
[2:32:40] harlots he got in the lap of
[2:32:43] Delilah the devil determined to know her
[2:32:47] strength know his strength
[2:32:50] where did your strength come
[2:32:52] from tell me your
[2:32:58] secret Samson types the church it got
[2:33:01] bound with cords broke them Luther came
[2:33:04] out Bound Again Wesley come out Bound
[2:33:09] Again hereza
[2:33:15] movement finally in that last zza
[2:33:18] movement
[2:33:20] they cut off his
[2:33:23] hair the power was taken
[2:33:26] away the devil began to
[2:33:28] afflict and he was just like any other
[2:33:34] man and there he
[2:33:37] was the devil's no friend of
[2:33:40] yours he'll take you and you'll
[2:33:43] grind he'll blind you and you will grind
[2:33:46] at the devil's
[2:33:48] meal he will take you out and promise
[2:33:51] you every kind of thing in there is in
[2:33:53] the world but you'll wind up Drive
[2:33:55] grinding food for the devil round and
[2:33:59] around and
[2:34:02] around but I want you to remember Samson
[2:34:04] was a type of the real
[2:34:08] church and in that moment in that time
[2:34:11] where that he was in this horrible
[2:34:16] condition his hair started growing
[2:34:21] there is a promise that says I will
[2:34:23] restore sayeth the Lord a new crop is
[2:34:26] going on that that is the very hope of
[2:34:29] the
[2:34:30] church if there's ever going to be a
[2:34:32] Rapture it'll be because there is a
[2:34:35] church who is
[2:34:37] restored of people who have the power
[2:34:41] again a people who know their God and do
[2:34:46] exploits I want you to know there they
[2:34:49] took him out began to make fun of
[2:34:54] him Samson now becomes a name of
[2:34:58] derision Samson oh Samson they afflict
[2:35:02] him they beat him they make him do
[2:35:04] tricks they do all things and finally
[2:35:07] they got enough from
[2:35:08] that and let him alone for a minute and
[2:35:12] he said to his little boy that was
[2:35:14] guiding him around said take me to where
[2:35:16] the two post are that holds up this
[2:35:18] building
[2:35:24] putting my hands on each
[2:35:27] post and he said oh
[2:35:31] God remember your
[2:35:33] Covenant look down and see your word
[2:35:37] your word says I'll have a bride without
[2:35:40] spot or wrinkle or blemish or any such
[2:35:44] thing your word it says that they that
[2:35:47] are alive and remain
[2:35:50] it will not hinder those that are
[2:35:53] asleep look here look the mahar's
[2:35:56] growing
[2:35:57] out my Covenant is coming
[2:36:00] back the seals have been taken up off
[2:36:03] and the whole book is
[2:36:04] open and the Bible is ours and every
[2:36:08] promise
[2:36:09] is and there he begin to say Lord avin
[2:36:13] me of my eyes and what my enemy has done
[2:36:17] and I tell you we ought to say Satan you
[2:36:20] have defeated the church all the way
[2:36:22] down to the ages and to the time and
[2:36:24] they turn back into systems and
[2:36:26] denomination and whatever else but
[2:36:28] you're going to get paid
[2:36:30] back amen because the last defeat there
[2:36:33] will be more die of the Philistines and
[2:36:36] what all that what all the rest of the
[2:36:38] church did we're going to have the
[2:36:40] greatest victory in the last
[2:36:43] day Hallelujah the greatest Victory
[2:36:47] comes at the end time but we will not
[2:36:51] see death but we shall be changed in a
[2:36:53] moment in a twinkling of an eye and
[2:36:56] defeat death
[2:36:59] itself
[2:37:01] Hallelujah and he began to
[2:37:05] feel and he said
[2:37:07] Lord avenge me of my
[2:37:10] enemies and he began to cry out just
[2:37:15] once more
[2:37:18] Lord other
[2:37:22] that's the
[2:37:24] church do it
[2:37:27] again you moved in the past move

[2:37:34] you delivered God's people in the past
[2:37:36] deliver again just once more Lord amen
[2:37:40] and the Samson there begin to scream out
[2:37:43] just once more Lord and he and he said I
[2:37:47] he realized he was going to have to die
[2:37:49] in order to receive this and you're
[2:37:50] going to have to die to your pride to
[2:37:53] your ambition to your own ways you're
[2:37:55] going to have to surrender your all give
[2:37:57] up that lukewarmness and that coldness
[2:38:00] that you have Lord God and cry out to
[2:38:02] him and say just once more God let me
[2:38:06] feel your spirit amen and all of a
[2:38:09] sudden the fibers of his being began to
[2:38:12] swell something begin to happen I tell
[2:38:15] you here's a fiber here and there's a
[2:38:16] fiber there and there's a fiber there
[2:38:19] and there's of fire oh if it would all
[2:38:21] get filled with the Holy Ghost and the
[2:38:24] fire of God move in the church again and
[2:38:27] you would see the spirit of God deliver
[2:38:30] God's people amen we ought to be crying
[2:38:33] out this morning like the church just
[2:38:36] once more Lord that's our cry let us
[2:38:40] receive of your spirit why don't you bow

[2:39:02] down let me Lord today defeat my enemy
[2:39:06] before he defeats
[2:39:08] me I realize I got to be a church that
[2:39:11] is calling out to God just once
[2:39:15] more that's willing to take what is
[2:39:18] foolish

[2:39:22] nothing the word of God the
[2:39:25] promises and take them and defeat our
[2:39:34] enemy he made you to be a
[2:39:42] Nazarite it's those things that are
