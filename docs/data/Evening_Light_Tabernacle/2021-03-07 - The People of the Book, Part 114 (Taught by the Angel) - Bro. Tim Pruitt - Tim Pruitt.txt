praise the lord god bless you man my we've had a wonderful time already today singing the praises of god and enjoying the blessings of redemption the psalmist would say redeemed how i love to proclaim it redeemed by the blood of the lamb redeemed by his infinite mercy his child and forever i am amen aren't you glad to be his child today amen to be here in the presence of god where he can speak to us we're going to read from the book of exodus chapter 3 and verse 1 today and i'm going to read um most of this chapter this morning as we look into the scripture at least 15 15 verses of this chapter and uh we want to just look back in the bible and look at it as a prophecy of this end time where we are in this end time amen may god bless you as you stand as we read the word of god exodus chapter 3 verse 1. now moses kept the flock of jethro his father-in-law the priest of midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of god even to horeb and the angel lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed and moses said i will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt and when the lord saw that he had turned aside the sea god called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses and he said here am i and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground moreover he said i am the god of thy father the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob and moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon god and the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their task masters for i know their sorrows and i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good lamb and a large a large into a lamb flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites and therefore behold the cry of the children of israel is come unto me for i have seen the oppression wherewith the egyptians oppressed them come now therefore i will send thee unto pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt and moses said unto god who am i that i should go into pharaoh that i should bring forth the children of israel out of egypt and he said certainly i will be with you and this shall be a token unto thee that i have sent thee when thou has brought forth the people of out of egypt ye shall serve god upon this mountain and moses said unto god behold when i come unto the children of israel and say unto them the lord god or the god of your fathers hath sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall i say unto them and god said unto moses i am that i am and he said thou shalt say unto the children of israel i am has sent me unto you and god said moreover unto moses thus shalt i say unto the children of israel the god of your fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac the god of jacob has sent me unto you this is my name forever and this is my memorial unto all generations and here we are at the last generations amen god bless you you can be seated amen we trust that you'll just uh enjoy the presence of the lord today as we look into the word of god it's just good to see everybody that has assembled with us and if you're a visitor here here with us today we hope that next time you come you won't feel like a visitor amen but you'll feel very comfortable in the presence of god he is here to transform lives and that's what we have seen him do and that's what he will continue to do and um you know we are we're going to be speaking today on being taught by the angel and we have been speaking on the angel of the lord that has been down through scripture and in in the old testament and even in the new testament and um and of course where we are in this time in this generation as i believe we are to be a people that are led by the angel of the lord amen now what sets us apart is that this message is not heralded by or from some denominational headquarters but it actually descended from heavenly dimensions dimensions beyond as an angel stepped out into light much like he did at the first exodus now this scene that um we see in moses time was with me today among most christians kind of a foreign thought or foreign scene it's something that was of yesterday but not of today it would um it would be though something that would the angel lord would be in his pre-incarnate condition because it was a pre-incarnate christ as the angel of the covenant would come down through time all the way until it became incarnate in jesus christ and then after jesus death burial and resurrection and ascension into glory the apostle paul who had never met the lord physically would meet him on the road to damascus and at this time he had returned back to again the the same light that he was as he would meet the children of israel in a pillar of fire in a in a cloud by day and a fire by night and it would it would be that paul would would ask this great light as it spoke to him and who art thou lord and he would say i am jesus and and so we know then that jesus has returned um in the presence of his pillar of fire in the same way that he was in the the uh in his pre-incarnate condition now the message that we're preaching about today it descended from those same heavenly dimensions and um i i think you know when god does something up on the earth he announces it by the angels and and you would see this when john the baptist would come that there would be the angel of god would appear to zacharias his father and tell him about a child that was coming and then there would be again the angel gabriel coming to mary and telling her of how that god would become incarnate and he would borrow her womb to do it in and it would be by the overshadowing of the holy spirit without her knowing any man and and so this is this is god's pattern and god's way even if it is far into the mind of most christians today this was the early church this was the original pattern this is bible doctrine now again you know if john the baptist was announced by the angel and he was the forerunner of the first coming of christ that we know that if we're looking for his second coming which we are then there should be a forerunner to forerun his second coming and would not we expect then that that forerunner to be announced by an angel now we're going to speak just for a moment as i bring some things into review and maybe some here will be the first time you ever heard about this but 75 years ago on may the 7th 1946 there was the angel lord appeared in person to william branham he had been seeing visions he had been hearing the angel's voice since a child he had seen him as a whirlwind in the tree that and a voice that spoke and said never smoke or drink or defile your body in any way for um i have a work for you to do when you're older you see the angel cares about what you do you see you some say well it's just what we believe if we just believe it in our heart you know then we we don't have to have actions that matches our belief no the angel cares about what you do he don't want you drinking smoking defiling your body amen he wants you to live a clean sanctified life that has been a work of the holy spirit the angel of god in your life amen because the holy spirit is that same angel of the covenant that appeared to moses there in a burning bush of fire so the angel cares about you he cares about what you do he cares about us in this generation in this time he cares that our hearts is turned back to the faith of the fathers he cares that we come back to the original doctrines that paul taught he cares what we believe about scripture any way is not going to do amen the angel of god is very concerned about the people of this generation of your time he's concerned about you he'll come to your seat he'll deal with your heart he'll speak to you as a prodigal amen where he will come right to you and warn you even in the night or when you're right there in the very slop of sin and he will stir your heart and he will move upon you to come into his presence to return back to the father to come home you see you if homer for you is not the world home for you is not sin hope for you is not a devil's child home for you is god's kingdom amen he chose you before the world began and you fell from him because of sin but he's here to restore you back to where you fell from what he had in his mind of you to restore you back to that original condition where god saw you in his plan before the world began i want you to know this morning we are not happen to sense people we are not accidents that have just happened a long life sway but we are predestinated and called and ordained and set out for a purpose for this moment and this time have we come [Applause] and that means that he is a messenger of the of the second coming bringing a message to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers god's concerned about what you believe he wants you on the right track and man you say well you know brother timmy didn't find me in sin he found every person in sin i was raised up in a christian home but he found me in sin he found me as a sinner he found me needing redemption amen and if you have not received redemption no matter how good you've been how holy that you've acted how how close that you've walked the dress code and done everything was just exactly right let me tell you you still need a savior you still need a redeemer some of the worst things we've got around the country is a bunch of message brats on the pew who have never come to know jesus [Applause] now the angel had appeared on the ohio river before perhaps hundreds of people it was like a star that appeared over william branham and said the voice said as john the baptist forerunned the first coming of christ you're sent with a message to forerun the second coming of christ this would also be witnessed in some of the great healing campaigns that would take place as as brother branham would carry a message of divine healing to the sick and the afflicted and he would become known among the pentecostals as a prophet of god he would be they would write books about him that says a man sent from god and they would testify of him as a prophet who visited south africa they were they would have to testify of the divine gift and what god was doing and those very books they would testify and they would say it was it was more than just that that that what happened at the river but men and women who didn't even know it wouldn't know anything about it who had never heard of the prophecy would rise up in the congregation and began to speak in other tongues and interpretations would come to those tongues and a prophecy would come out and say that's john the baptist what sentiment run the first coming of christ you're sent with a message to forerun the second coming of christ amen now again t.l osborn would say the same thing as he was a man who carried that message down into argentina down into africa down into many many places in his mission work but it was there that he saw the the very thing happening he said it wasn't a voice i heard it wasn't i knew and knew of others that said it but something rung up within my heart as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of christ you're sent with a message to forerun the second coming we're here in that time we are men and women of the second coming amen the rapture lays ahead the ascension lays ahead the chains of the body lays ahead but we are still men and women of the second coming we still preach funerals it says and we will use the scripture that comforts us that says we which are alive and remain shall not hinder those that are asleep but the trump of god shall sound and then the lord shall descend with a voice this with a with a shout and a voice and a trumpet we read those scriptures but i want you to know and i want to reaffirm it to you today that's not just a funeral scripture that's not just something when we bury somebody i want you to know that's a prophecy that is of this last day amen that somebody's going to fulfill and it ought to be men and women today in a hunger than their heart god let your word be fulfilled in my life i want to see that fulfillment that resurrection life hallelujah amen amen now talking about resurrection life i'll tell you what i told my wife on the uh on the way to church today i said karen if brother kenneth's in church today i'm just gonna have a run away jubilee amen yeah i'm gonna have a runaway jubilee brother kenneth amen because why here's a man that was struck down and was in a dying condition in the icu come on thirty percent of tens of printed thirty percent of his heart working it was giving up on him blood clots in the lungs uh cancer in the bones i don't know how many strikes he gets the devil gets to hit at somebody amen by the way laying there i said and i told him the other day i said you know we're going to have to name you lazarus because he doesn't come up from that condition so many times why because jesus christ is still the same yesterday today and forever and the other day when cloven thought he would take him down kobe didn't have enough to take a 70 year old man down come on the devil ain't got enough because why the resurrection power of jesus christ is still in the church he's the resurrection in the life oh you know brother branham coming up it was in a time where nobody believed in divine healing nobody believed in visions nobody believed i mean days of miracles were passed and being told that these visas and voices were of the devil because god no longer did those things the age of it was passed he finally went into a a a place behind an old cabin and you know he he began to pray about it asking god to take away these visions and and and because the theologians and the fellow ministers were saying it was all the devil to hear the voice of god's peak and so he went to ask god to take it away and somewhere about midnight a light came into the room and in that light he could see a man's feet and it materialized the rest of the body and out of that light stepped a man he was about six foot tall about 200 pounds solid complexion dark eyes a smooth face with no beard but hair writing down about down to his shoulders and he said fear not and when he did he recognized it was the same voice that he had heard since he was a boy and he said i am sent from the presence of god now notice it was the presence of god he said didn't feel the same it was like when the holy spirit comes around and makes you feel happy but it was different it was a sacred august feeling amen but it was the presence of the lord he was like a man and he had walked out of this fire this whipping milling light and yet he was like a man yet he was a supernatural being that walks right out of that light that it entered the room and that light was like a whirling pulsating fire it milled about churning uh hanging in the air pulsating with the energy glow growing bigger and brighter and then as the light spread out on the floor getting larger and larger spreading on the floor he could hear footsteps and squinting into the light he could see a barefoot and then a robe and out of there walked a man now the amber light continued hanging over his head still whirling pulsating with energy and this this this supernatural being would look at him with kind expression was a face that brother branham would never forget although he could never find words to describe it fully see it was so gentle and peaceful and yet with a sense of power and authority he said no it wasn't jesus but he said it was an angel from his presence and and as he as he spoke he said i am sent from the presence of almighty god to tell you that your peculiar birth and misunderstood life has been to indicate you're to take a gift of divine healing to the people of the world and if you'll be sincere when you pray and get the people to believe you remember that the report must be believed somebody's going to believe it then he said nothing will stand before your prayers amen not even cancer oh my amen you you'll go into many parts of the world and pray for kings and rulers and potentiate you preach the multitudes the world over and thousands will come to you for counsel you must tell them that their thoughts that they speak louder in heaven than their words do on the earth amen this is a god who who said the word discerns the thoughts and the intents of the heart now we're reading from the account of exodus is where we read from this morning and that's the second book of and moses in the presence of this pillar of fire and the theophanic angel of the covenant he would receive a commission with signs of deliverance he would be given two signs right one he would thrust his hand into his bosom it would come out white with leprosy throw it back in and it would come out it would come out clean this is a very type of salvation leprosy is a type of sin let me go down this line just for a moment you see leprosy would make a person unclean or that they couldn't even live in their home where they couldn't even live in their town they would have to live on the outside and everywhere that they would go they would have to keep their mouth covered and they would have to scream out i'm unclean i'm unclean i'm unclean i'm a leper i'm unclean you know what that's what sin does to you amen it'll speak right out of the life amen you don't even have to tell nobody you don't even have to say you know i'm unclean your life will tell it the spirit about you will tell it hey man he'll scream out i'm unclean i'm unclean i'm unclean i'm unclean but you know there was a when leprosy was cured there was a sacrifice given for that and that was they took two turtle doves and they took the one and they would take the head off of it and they would sprinkle its blood on the living mate and then they would set that living mate free come on and he would go for it sprinkling the blood of the dead meat and of course it was it was safe clean and clean and spreading cleansing everywhere went come on that's exactly what jesus did his life the dove was poured out upon us the unclean sinner a man poured out upon you have set you free you're no longer in prison you're no longer bound you're no longer a sinner you are a child of the most high god and your life is unclean and clean before the life of my mate has made me clean the other of course it would be a sign it would be a sign of his rob turn into a serpent a cobra which would be which would be the replica very symbol of the pharaoh of egypt the highest power in the land and moses was shown by that i have the power to loose you or the power to bind you and anything that comes and opposes me like your snakes will be swallowed up [Music] now so we're reading from this account of exodus moses in the presence of this pillar of fire and this theophanic angel of the covenant he would receive a commission and with signs of deliverance and later he would come to mount sinai as he's told about here you will bring them again into this mountain is remarkable to realize but it would be actually 50 days um or seven weeks after the the slaying of the lamb and the passover and the coming out of egypt and they would go and for after 50 days it would come to mount sinai it would be on mount sinai that the law was given the jews would say of that event it was when god married israel and took her for a bride because he was making a covenant with her is that right amen how many knows we got a covenant this is our covenant amen come on you get married and you make your vows you say i will i will i will be true i will be honest i will i will obey you know all the vows that are being made and when you take god's covenant to be his bride you vow amen you vow to keep this word you vow to esteem that day holy and your life to be holy and when you vow to take on his great name and to spread to represent that name because now everything that you do in word or deed you are doing representing the name of jesus christ your bridegroom so whatever he says in the holy scriptures you believe it you accept it and you act upon it to do otherwise breaks your marriage vow you're married now there as i said 50 days later upon mount sinai moses would would actually go into the presence of god and in the presence of the angels of god as as it would be revealed to him by the hand of the angel he would actually write to five first books of the old testament wherever we got you know genesis account you know maybe moses had heard from the egyptians how the beginning was and the creation and how it taken place perhaps you'd heard from from his his mother the short time he was there in her home how the creation was and how it all began but he would have to forget all of his knowledge and he would come into the presence of that angel and he would write out the first five books of your bible was given by the angel of god to a prophet now moses would write in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth now again we come to the last chapter or the last book rather of the bible and the last book of the bible is the book of revelation and the book of revelation john would actually hear again um as the bible said he sent it and signified it or or brought it by the a by his angel so again the last book of the bible is written and given by the angel to john it is the testimony or the revelation of jesus christ are you with me now amen and john would hear the voice of god and it said in revelation 1 11 saying i am alpha and omega the first and the last now notice he was the first he was the first expression of god he was the first of god that could be seen it was this theophanic messenger that was the word the logos of god the pillar of fire that was the first thing that would go forth from god think of this then he says in revelation 3 14 to the angel of the church he says these things saith thee amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god so again he has searched to the last age i'm not only the beginning but i'm the end i'm not only the first of the book it is it is the last of the book from genesis to revelation i am alpha and omega and what did you see in the old testament is still the same god working in the new testament not a different god the same god now he is the beginning of the new creation now notice this he's the beginning of the creation of god notice said now so notice this the beginning of the creation so how could god be created if he was a spirit see how could he be he's eternal he never was created he will never be created because he's god at the beginning he always was god amen any but here's the beginning of the creation of god and that was jesus christ when he was made manifest in the flesh when god lived in him he is god's creation the first and the last amen so again when god created himself a body he come down and lived in it that was beginning of the creation of god this is where god created himself a body in the beginning he created the heavens and earth but the beginning of the new creation he created himself a body to come and live in it now revelation 1 8 i am alpha and omega i'm the beginning and the ending saith the lord which was or which is which was and which is to come the almighty so i want you to get it he is he is he is the same yesterday that's which was which is today and which is to come forever he's hebrews 13 8 right amen the same yesterday today and forever the almighty not a junior god the very god amen notice here the almighty to the church of evidences he says this three times on the almighty he comes right over to laodicea and he says i am the amen i was the first back here i'm the last over here at the beginning of the creation of god through the church ages that we were we're to have you you'll learn i am god god created in a man-form i'm the beginning of the creation of god we're speaking about jesus now amen oh that ought to make anybody shout amen to think about it the beginning of the creation of god and when god was created when god was made flesh in jesus christ can you imagine god now becomes a part of his own creation now multitudes of people get the idea when jesus that jesus was the first creation of god that makes him lower than godhead that would then that first creation would create all the rest of the universe whatever it contained but that's not right that don't match with the rest of the bible because how could god be created when he himself is the creator is that right the eternal logos god was manifest in the sun and in jesus dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily and that eternal one was the father manifest in the flesh and thereby gained the title of son this is how he became the son is the father created himself a body to come and live in it and because it came out from him it is called the son of god now notice and in him the bible said but dwell the fullness of the godhead bodily that's why in the new testament genesis account of how the world was created john 1 1 says in the beginning was the word now this word here word means logos in the beginning was the logos that is the pillar of fire that's the theophany christ in the beginning was the word and the word was with god where was he with god he was there as the lamb slain before the foundation of the world come on so this was in god's mind that man was the word and the word would be expressed the thoughts of god would be expressed and become the word of god and this projection of god was god now so again the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by the word and without the word was not anything made that was made john 1 14 and the word the low gospels made flesh and dwelt among us the logos become flesh in jesus christ and we beheld his glory as the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth i'm trying to show you who this theophany christ is i'm trying to show you who this angel of the covenant is you see the beginning of it all was when god released himself from his thoughts to become the word and that expression of his thoughts was the word and now the word became the form of god amen it was it was represented as a sacred light because god is light is that right it was a pillar of fire that started moving as it moved toward manifestation in a theophanic form now first of all in the beginning god dwelt alone with his attributes that's his thoughts there was nothing just god alone in his thoughts how many you know god's eternal so i mean you can't count years of how long that existed like that is that right amen you know and he was just as if a great architect would sit down and begin to make a plan you begin to draw out uh you know something you know exactly when i when we started building this building i had a thought in mind i had a thought in mind and you know of what i wanted and about the size i wanted and what kind of rooms were out and the style of building all of these things we had something in mind we projected it to a skilled architect and he would write it out he said you want it like this i said yes but more like this and you want it like this but yes i want this included here and there and finally what was in my mind became on paper you see but it had to be spoken at an architect or shall i say a prophet would write it down and said here's what come from god's thoughts the word that was spoke to me and now i've got it manifested on the paper amen now then finally what was what was in my thoughts became on paper and it went from paper into manifestation so god in his beginning he had a plan and he had a family in mind amen he speak it out through the prophets he would write it out in the blueprint come on church oh man he would write it out on the blueprint and then once he wrote it out on the blueprint it's got to come in the manifestation in flesh god will have a bride of people without spock or blemish [Music] now in the beginning god dwelt alone now he was dwelt along with his thinking and that thought when is expressed is a word it's a thought expressed as a word but it has to be a thought first so it's god's attributes that then it becomes a thought then a word now notice first of all god is invisible go with me to first timothy 1 17 now unto the king eternal immortal invisible the only wise god be glory forever and ever so he is eternal he's the king eternal immortal invisible and the only wise god there's no other god beside him hebrews 11 27 by faith moses forsook egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured as seen or rather taken heed to him who is invisible and then in colossians 1 14 we see in jesus whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in the earth of visible and invisible uh whether that be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers or all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist so we see that jesus now is the image of the invisible god he was made to portray god in his fullness now john 1 18 says no man has seen god at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom or the heart which is the father's heart and when he have declared him so again no man has seen god at any time but the only begotten of the son has made him visible the invisible god was made visible in jesus that's why when philip saw said show us the father turn with me to john 4 23 and we'll we'll get it here um and hear that our father is a spirit and i want to start right there with that and then we'll talk about philip but he said in john 4 23 but this but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seek as such to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth so god is a spirit he is an invisible spirit jesus would say it was like the wind he said you know you it blows where the list is but no one knows where it come from they don't know where it went all you can see is the effects of it now so in john 14 8 when philip said because he said that he was the image of the invisible god that in john 4 23 but the hour cometh oh excuse me john 14 8 philip said to him lord show us the father and it'll satisfy us because he said i'm going to the father i'm going back to fatherhood again i'm leaving here walking the shores of galilee but i'm going back to the form i was before i came here and jesus said unto him have i been so long with you and yet thou has not known me philip he that seen me has seen the father and how sayest thou then show us the father believeth thou not that i am in the father and the father in me and the words that i speak unto you are not of my i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works believe that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work's sake if you can't believe me for what i'm saying just look and see the signs amen now the same thing that he's saying but how do you say philip show us the father when you see me you've seen the father because why he had the son had declared the invisible god amen he put on god the invisible and put on a body that would declare god amen that we can see exactly what his attitude was toward the sick toward the loss come on church amen all you got to do is look at the image of the invisible god the likeness that is jesus christ the full expression of god you'll know what he thinks about the sick you'll know what he thinks about the lust amen you you'll be like that woman who was caught right in the midst of her sin and he would say neither do i condemn thee go thou in sin no more thy sins be forgiven this is the kind of god we serve now what god did now listen closely wake up your neighbor so that he hears what i'm talking about amen what god did was he fathered himself a body to live in and in that form he was the son because the body was fathered by creation in the womb of mary that's right amen now god came down in a blood cell think of this mary knew no man it was the overshadowing of the holy spirit there was a creation that took place on the inside of her god placed the egg and the sperm some someone would say well he's a jew he's not a jew someone would say well he's a gentile for all of us no he's not a gentile somebody say well he's he's black he's not a black you want to say he's white he's not a wife he's the creation of god amen now he didn't come down to join your race he came down to start a new race so that you could be of a new blood and a new bloodline by the spirit are you with me now the god came down in a blood cell not through a man but by the holy ghost into that virgin womb of mary you see a tabernacle was built for the purpose of death now he would taste death god couldn't do that god can't die so he would make and design a body that he would come and dwell in so that that body could be offered as the lamb sacrifice now watch now to see the woman came in ordered that he would be bruised to bring our salvation this is an ancient prophecy all the way back when when when mary not mary went even and adam was walking out of the garden and here they were in that where sin had come in death was now upon them changes were taking place they were moving from immortality into mortal condition they were dying he said the day you eat there of that day you die and they begin to die from that very moment and here they're walking out of the garden remember even to have that conference with god god would slay a lamb and he would take those garments and put them on adam and put them on eve and here they are going down along the trail and that bloody garment is slapping down along them they've been dripping with blood because god is seeing there's going to come a time that there will be the lamb of god who will slay who will be slain for the sins of the world and i'll take him and i'll take away your sins and give you his righteousness and i won't be able to see your sins anymore because all i can see is the righteousness of jesus christ [Applause] now then he is a walking out amen god saying you have sinned you've done wrong get out of my presence you're walking out of the gate of the garden of eden out of paradise they may never never to ever be able to come back again and as they do when the heart of god moves toward his children so but you know you're going but you're not going along [Music] i'm going with you because i'm going to be a seed and as a seed i'm going to give it to a woman and in that woman's seed i'm going to bruise the head of this serpent and i'm going to correct what she did to mankind so the ancient prophecy said thy seed shall thy seed shall bruise his head and the serpent seed would bruise his heel where he touched the earth where he walked upon the earth it would be when he walked upon the earth when he become flesh there jet would bite him but in doing so he would crush the head of the ancient serpent i want you to know because of calvary amen the old serpent that called you to sin to be born in sin shape and iniquity come to the world speaking life god crossed your head at calvary hallelujah and even though the death right now works in your mortal body it true will be championed over but you will not lay in them pray forever but you will rise again and if you're alive and remain at the coming of the lord you will be changed in a moment in a twinkling the holy ghost came upon mary he gave her a seed the woman has no seed god gave her a seed and and he created within that womb the cell that would multiply and become the body of our lord amen now let me just take a moment i've been a farmer most of my life i was i've been an animal lover all of my life when i was a young boy it was dogs that were my passion when i come into teenagers it was purebred goats that were my passion i have today registered angus they're not so much my passion i'm getting too old for it all and i'm about to let everything go but let me just talk about it for a moment you see we have science has developed in this time where used to be that all we could have was we had to own the male and then the female and there had to be a physical breeding science learned that they could take the seed of the male and they could freeze it way down into way down below i think it's like not under 200 degrees below freezing in the nitrogen and it would and that life would live there for for a long time there in fact i had reproductions from animals that were where that sperm had been put up for 30 plus years and i could go back in a pedigree and i could bring that animal forward and i would cause him then to be this great great grandson and i bring his genes forward into my breeding program and you know because we we bred champion goats and was known all over the united states for that national competitions and so on but now you know then they learned that you know but it was kind of a poor thing that one one female could only produce so many offsprings so many times you would not just want the the male you would want the females offspring also to come so they learned with embryo transplants where they would take and super ovulate the the woman they would taken or shall i say the animal the female super oblate her because they do this in humans too and then they would take and match the sperm with the egg and then they'd take that fertilized embryo and they would take it and freeze it this too would have um we don't know it's an indefinite amount of years of life that would be held down in that nitrogen and and so you know it would it would be that way for animal reproduction we found that here locally we had a a cow that was on the lakabi dairy farm i don't know that they were totally successful with their breeding plum program but they had a cow a jersey cow she gave a phenomenal amount of milk that was way over the records for the state and for most of the united usa and they wanted her genes well you know they could get sons of her but if they could get you know if they could reproduce more of her hundreds of her so what they would do is they would super oblate this lockaby dairy cow and jesus jersey and they would super ovulate her they would get and and harvest the um the eggs from her they would mix it with the best bulls of the country and they would then take those embryos and they would just find a surrogate mother so it might be a black angus she could be a scrub cow should be an old white face with long horns may not look like anything like a jersey whatsoever but they would take that egg and and sperm and they would insert it into the this surrogate mother now when this calf was born it was full blood jersey it had no characteristics whatsoever of its surrogate mother though that mother would give birth to it that mother would lick it that mother would move to it like it was her baby it was her baby in all sense but not one speck of her blood was in this offspring amen now god's been doing this a long time before man ever thought about doing things and what god did is he didn't borrow from the womb of mary an egg he created it do you have to get the sperm and he took any place right there in mary's body and mary gave birth to it and mary nurse that impressed into her bosom but there wasn't one speck of mary's blood in it amen you're not saying this morning by jude's blood you are saved by the blood of god it was god who gave that blood it was god who has redeemed you [Applause] now as we look into this for a moment i want you to think of that this blood cell would multiply it would become the body of our lord it was it was the beginning of the creation of god that's who jesus is he was the one that was filled with the holy blood he was that holy one with holy blood even the blood of god that tabernacle came to birth he grew to be a man he went down to jordan and down in jordan is where the sacrifice was washed on of of john in the river called jordan and with that when that acceptable sacrifice rose up from out of the water god came and then dwelt him filling him with the spirit without measure and when jesus died and shed his blood the perfect life of god was liberated everybody remember it was first wrapped up in a blood cell but then when he died it liberated the life of god not just to be bring cleansing for you but so that the life of your sacrifice could come back about you the worshiper amen amen thanks be to god oh now i want to stop just for a moment what a blood this is let's just go down this uh avenue in just a moment let's think of it along this line in the old testament god would tell them to bring a lamb and that lamb was to be without blemish that lamb had been had to be examined and that makes sure there was nothing wrong no infirmities no mars it couldn't be they couldn't offer a crippled lamb they couldn't offer a a blemish lamb it had to be perfect a perfect lamb and i want you to know that you know when the when they brought the lamb that to the priest the even for the for the token there in exodus 14 where the blood was to be a token a sign so the death angel would pass over it was the lamb that was kept up for so many days and examined that and then once it was examined then it was taken the priest and if it was up without blemish it would be accepted for the worshiper amen now i want you to notice a man could come in he could be a sinner maybe he had done wrong maybe he had committed adultery maybe he had lustful passions but he was a sinner he had done wrong maybe he had done his neighbor wrong he he needed redemption he needed he needs something to die in his place because he wasn't worthy to meet a god who who looked for for someone without a blemish and when he comes into the priest's presence and he brings he bringing out his lamb the priest never ever looks at the man to see if the man is worthy to see if he's been good to see if he's never made a mistake to see that he's without blemish he don't pay any attention to the man he is his eyes are on the lamb and if the lamb is accepted no matter how without believers or how much blemish the man is but if the lamb is accepted then the worshiper is accepted hallelujah i want you to know our lamb that we present this morning it's jesus christ the lamb of god from the foundation of the world are you with me now and we can present him as the blemish spotless lamb and god is not even looking at you as you come to him but to see if you've accepted the blood sacrifice of the lamb there god came and indwelted him filling him with the spirit without measure at the river jordan he died shed his blood that the perfect life of the lamb could be liberated now that's another thing you see the life of the sacrifice of that lamb the wooly lamb it could not come back the innocency of that lamb could not come back on the worshiper so the worshiper after slaying the lamb and his sins cleansed he would walk out still sinning same desires that he had before he had afterwards maybe he was a drunkard he would still be a drunkard amen the habits that he had the old sinful nature was all still there because the innocency of that lamb could not come back upon him somebody with me now but i'll tell you it's different with this line because this lamb did not die just to take away your sin this lamb died so his life could come back on you so that the very innocency of the life of the lamb of god can come upon your life and change you forever where your desires are no longer the same desire sin is gone and dead is midnight hallelujah i'll tell you what it's tracking when we get to look at it amen because what we saw there was jehovah come down crying over a manure pile they're born in the stable amen born in a mangerless trial and this is an everlasting sign to us amen it is a sign of of the the seed of the woman that was given by god to take away sin when god will become created in flesh just like your flesh it's called the condescension of god or god in morphe god changing form he was god but he would morphe he would change forms he would take leave the form of god to take on the form of a servant what was he doing he was coming a servant to take away your sins and he would come not in a king's palace but he'd come so the very lowest of us could identify with him he didn't come just to save those who were royal blood in our opinions belonged to the children of the king of israel of each uh of england no he came that the lowest of us the lowest of the lowest the armpit of humanity the dreads amen he came down to to save you to save me to find us no matter what condition we're in hallelujah oh he didn't come looking for the high mighty he even said i didn't even come to call the righteousness to repentance i called to call the sinner to repent this is him a friend of sinners and publicans amen that's still him today he's the friends of the junker he's the friends of a dope head he's the brand of the prostitute he's the friend of the effeminate he's the friend of sinners but he don't leave you in your sins he comes to save you from your sin and lift you up out of sin [Applause] that's a sign to this puffed-up and pseudo-intellectuals those who think they know something their nose up in the air and they're the goody-goody because they've got a degree behind their name because they've been successful in life they've evolved their own theology and deny the truth of god jehovah god crying a crime baby in this tinking and barn we think we got a right to be proud and hold up our nose and criticize and acting as though we're somebody he became a nobody so you can become a somebody [Applause] amen come on he would actually go to cross and become a sinner taking on your sins and become lost and go to hell in your place amen so that you can be saved i want you to know this lab took the penalty that you deserved now this is the things the angel was teaching he was teaching us by the sacrifice he was teaching us by the commandments that he gave by the words that he gave now notice god said that he would give us a sign this everlasting sign and this sign would be jehovah despised to reject it jehovah's standing in the courtyard bruised and and bleeding with thorns on his brow and spit on his face mocked and said it not while hypocrites would jeer and and dared him to come down off the cross that was jehovah dying jehovah praying and nothing happening so that you could pray and something happened amen did you overdied it's a sign for all men it's a great sign darkness came up on the earth then they put him in a tomb very late three days and nights until an earthquake shattered the gloom of the night and it came forward jehovah came forth jehovah sent it on high and then jehovah returns to indwell his church that's the holy ghost we have today it all became like a russian mighty wind amen oh flames of fire as it settled over 120 and jehovah was giving birth to more sons i'm glad to be a son of his today i'm glad to say i have the same life that he had the same light that was in him has also been given to me by a new birth amen jehovah came back to walk in the midst of his church to empower his people amen this time he came to stay in his people saying i'll never leave your versation and right now again jehovah heals the sick amen he raises the dead he manifests himself by the spirit jehovah came back speaking in tongues and giving the answer back in interpretation that's our jehovah amen jehovah came down and he raised a prostitute to sin no more he came down to the drunkard with the fly blows upon his face amen as he lays unconscious in a gutter and when he came to manifest himself in flesh and through flesh christ in you the hope of glory he came to shed his blood now we're bringing this right down now i'm not going to be as long this morning because i want to bring this down to you as as a gospel message i want you to realize the first thing was god this was god and then jesus came as god in the form of a man now that's hard for people to wrap their mind around that god would be so caring about you that he would leave his throne in glory for one sinner come on john 3 16 is about god so loved me that he gave his only begotten son because of his love that he had from me he would leave all of glory to come down the earth the love that he had for you amen and god now the creator of his own creation he would come down in the as a creator himself so much that he was god that he was a being on earth a being of time therefore he created himself a body to live in god himself created a body to live in for himself and he would start a new creation a creation of himself for god was created in human form jesus christ his son god dwelt he built a tabernacle flesh and bones and lived in that tabernacle it would be god emmanuel god with us he built himself a house to live in so he could reflect his word to his subjects through that you know what god is when you see christ now listen church god has done something for us in this generation that is absolutely marvelous because the gentiles worshiped hundreds of gods so that when they brought that into to christianity it was hard to see god in in different manifestations without believing in three persons of god so you can't hardly get it for a heathen to to accept there's only one god or there there's only one person it's of god amen now there's many forms of god come on because he would take on another form he would take on the form of el shaddai he'd take on the form of elohim he would take on the form of melchizedek amen not melchizedek would then become jesus christ now jesus christ the man the flesh was not melchizedek but melchizedek was jesus christ amen because as as jesus he did listen as a man he there he had a father he had a mother he he had beginning of days he had ended up life but not melchizedek but melchizedek come to dwell in this time being called jesus in order to give his life for redemption oh how wonderful that is to realize that that god would make himself manifest in human flesh and in human form now god so loved the world now let's take him for a moment let's go back at what he would do he would come down to israel a people who were slaves a people who their lives were thought nothing of they were lower than dogs they were mistreated they were abused they were there was a mixed multitude that went out with them because there were many of them that were were a mixed race because of of the the things that was happening to them as slaves down in egypt it was a horrible condition but god said i have heard the cry by reason of your taskmasters i have seen your sorrows and i have come down to deliver you this is the care of the angel of his presence that he sees every heartache that he sees every problem he sees every sinner and he comes down to say to seek and to save that which is lost i say what a redeemer what a caring savior that would come down to the insignificant the nobody that forgotten and say i have remembered a promise to you amen for i have come down to deliver are you with me now amen i'm going to try to bring this right on down to the end now as we as we bring this to a close today where you can see what i'm talking about the angel cares the angel is concerned the angel is concerned about your need you might be a parent today that's got a lost child a man that has grieved your heart that has offended your soul that has wounded you in every kind of way that has disappointed you in every kind of way but i want you to know god he cares he's still the angel who cares amen he cares so much that a little black insignificant woman would cause a storm there in tennessee as she would as she she began to pray god god i'll be your cinematic woman you gave me a child i didn't deserve it i tried to raise him right but here he is dying with this venereal disease and here he's gasping his last breath and he's out on a dark ocean somewhere and he's rowing and i'm lost and i'm lost oh i'm lost i can't find my way i'm lost that's the way you are this morning sinner you can't find your own way amen you can't clean yourself up you might be like the leopard a lick is pot but it only makes it brighter amen you might try to clean yourself up only to fall right down in the mud again but i want to tell you there's a god who cares there's a god who is concerned about your lost condition he is concerned about your lost children your lost sons and daughters amen and when the saints of god begin to pray and begin to expect god to move that's when god starts moving that's when the angels start starin this little woman began to cry out god god i'm your shooting my woman you gave me a child i tried to raise him right in he went astray but oh where's your elijah i need an elijah hallelujah i know i want you to know he didn't send oral roberts he didn't send billy graham he sent elijah she asked for elijah and man and the next morning here comes elijah walking down her street i tell you what god is about to do the same thing come walking down your street and to speak to your heart to save your soul to set you free from sin he's that kind of god that cannot reach down further once you can look up hallelujah brother brown would say that he said the faith of that woman the prayer and the faith that that woman created a storm hallelujah amen i want you to know right now you may take your child in a storm you may think your situation is in a storm but it's your own prayer that is creating a storm a man that's moving in the night that's moving in the heart that's speaking to a life and saying sinner you can't stay there sinner love you can't stay lost prodigal you can't stay out there and sin because i am god the redeemer hallelujah say my life has been a wreck my life has been a ruin i've been in a storm well let me tell you guys let you get in that storm so you can get a visitation from the angel of his presence wake up and come home

listen when i was a 16 year old boy preacher in a home meeting i was there one night and i had to preach and there a barber brought up him a couple of men and they were drunk they were fresh out of the bar you could smell it when they opened the door to alcohol it reeked throughout the place throughout the home it was there you know me being a young kid never been around alcohol myself i knew exactly what it was there was an old an old brother or old man there is i began to preach and conviction fell in that little living room that day this is the early days of this church in the in the that living room that day this man walked up and got on the other side of the pulpit just like this and stared me in the face and he said preacher i have been i have been the war and i killed men and i killed many many men i was in world war ii i had to fight and i had to defend our country could god would god save a man like me and there his breath was was in my my face as i was smelling his alcohol where he had tried to drown out his his his sorrows and his shame and his sin i want you to know alcohol will never drowned out your problems it'll only make them worse but it would get a hold of this man made himself he couldn't even drive more no more he he had hit somebody and killed the boy and they've taken his license away from life he was he was there stripped down a poor mortal in a horrible condition looking at me face to face in my eye and i said yes my god is big enough to save a soldier well i don't care what you've done even if you've murdered even if you've been in sin even if you've been a drunkard you tried to cover your sins with your alcohol and your sorrows away i want you to know my god can save you amen we prayed with that man that day and took him down to the watery grave and baptized him in the name of jesus christ he rose up from there never to drink another drop in his life amen because i've got saved amen because the angels of god are concerned about his children he comes to seek and deceive that which is lost brother branham said at an altar call when those sinners accepted christ angels raised up from their seats if you could see in the invisible world right now you would see angels directing this message directing it right to your seat and angel's right there up your seat and it's saying here come on boy let me get up from out of there get out of that sin get down to an altar there is an altar there is a place of mercy there is a place of grace we would pray we pray that you'll sacrifice this building which in which this

happen kind of got our minds off track of some things but we're still planning on doing our having a meeting here in the here the next month and inviting some folks to come we we have around there's probably around right now we have 15 about 25 30 young people that are coming that we've invited thus far we'd like to invite a few more but we need homes for that for them to stay in so if you have not done so please let the librarians know so we can kind of start moving we need to very fastly move that direction and get people into places also we experienced a lot of damage around our building from that storm and so we're having to deal with the insurance company to get some things taken care of the gutters the outside stucco the roof big gashes were torn the roof and things from that storm and got a lot of repairs to do and so we want to take care of that so we will be calling them a couple of work days in between now and easter as well so if you could prepare yourself for that we'd sure appreciate it to kind of get this place back and i don't know about you but i'm ready to have some meetings and the church and god gather together and let the holy ghost fall amen and so we want to invite some more people but you know we have limited space and things and so but if you could let us know how many you could hold and and take care of that we would sure appreciate it would be further announcements concerning that and and we'd like to also uh you know have maybe a meeting about that in a very very short time so god bless you today as you go amen may you go in the fear of the lord go thanking him for his saving power that god could save a sinner like me if he can save me he can save anybody amen thank god for his work in our lives god bless you today as you go in the
