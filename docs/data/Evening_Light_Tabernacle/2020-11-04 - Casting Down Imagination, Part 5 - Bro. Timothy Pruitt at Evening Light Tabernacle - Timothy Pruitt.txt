service to your hands lord everybody everything be said and done for your glory and for your honor lord we just want to say how much we love you father thank you for your grace thank you for your mercy thank you for your love thank you for all that you've done in jesus name amen [Music] amen it's good to be in the house of the lord amen let's turn to second corinthians 10. amen second corinthians 10 and verse 3 it says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ amen we let you be i'd seated to speak to you again on casting down imaginations looking at this strongholds strongholds or arguments or reasonings by which someone tries to fortify maybe their opinion or what they believe or defend and defend it against their opponent or someone else these strongholds are thoughts or arguments or reasonings and we might tonight we could call them the fiery darts of the enemy that would come against our mind and against our our peace amen and against our against our our mind in this world that we're living in because the devil uses thoughts he uses arguments he uses reasonings to to be to bring confusion either to try to complicate or hinder or destroy our faith or our trust in god and our trust in all that god is and all that god promised that's that's his goal is to try to destroy our trust in that and strongholds are targeted at our mind or our and our real problems you know or not our real problem is not the trial or the temptation that we go through but what we believe and where we put our faith and trust in the middle of our problems amen it ain't our pride ain't the problem or the trial you're going through that's really the real problem the real problem is where your trust is while you're going through the trial or where your faith is while you're going through the trial what you allow to capture your mind while you're going through the trial what you allow to capture your heart and your mind what you allow to take over or to build a stronghold or it will determine your outcome in these situations but we know faith defends both our mind and our heart against the strongholds and the imaginations of the enemy therefore we must have a stable place to put our our faith upon and that faith can only rest upon the word of god and that word of god is the only thing in this hour that is a stable place amen there's only in the world that we live in and you know the time that we're in even tonight and through this week and through the elections and all that kind of thing that's going on the whole world is holding their breath it's very unstable thing that people don't know what to do some are liking it some don't like it some of this that and the other but satan is there to try to grab a hold of minds during this time and you know uh we must realize that we're always going to have trials we're always going to have temptations it doesn't matter who you know would would win the election or who would would be in power or this that and the other that does not change it one thing we're always going to have trials and tribulations there's always going to be things that we have to uh fight against there's always going to be things that we have to conquer in the life that we're living but you know james would say it like this he would say my brethren counted all joy when you fall in the diver's temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience and let patience have a perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all men liberally unabradeth not and it shall be given to him but let him ask in faith nothing wavering amen that's a key nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave on the sea driven with the wind and tossed for let not that man think that he has received anything of the lord a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways or otherwise other words he's prone to change he's prone to fail he's prone in the middle of temptation to give way because one day he believes it the next day he daunts one day he's up the next day he's down therefore double man is unstable this in in all of his ways let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he's exalted but the rich that he's made low because of the flower of the grass he passes away the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat and it withers the grass and the flower thereof falleth and the grace of the fashion of it perish so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways but blessed is the man and that endureth temptation for when he has tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord has promised to them that love him how many loves him tonight amen i want to read this for a moment as we look at some things here in the amplified it says consider it nothing but joy when you fall into various trials when you have trials consider it joy i knew that was going to be like a pen that would drop amen you know when you're in the middle of your trial consider it joy nothing but joy be assured that the testing of your faith through the experience produces an endurance that leads to spiritual maturity and inner peace and let endurance have its perfect result and do a thorough work in you so that you may be perfect and completely developed in your faith lacking nothing if any of you lacks wisdom to guide you in the decision or a circumstance you're to ask of our wonderful god who gives to everyone generously and without rebuke or blame and it will be given to you but you must ask for wisdom and faith without doubting god's willingness to help for the one who doubts it is like a billowing surge of the sea that is blown about and tossed by the wind for such a person ought not to think or expect they will ever receive anything at all from the lord amen at all from the lord for being a double-minded man unstable and restless in all his ways and everything he thinks feels or decides a double-minded man let the brother in humble circumstances glorify glory in his high position amen as a born-again believer called the true riches to be an heir of god and the rich man is to glory and being humbled by trials revealing human frailty knowing true true riches are only found in the grace of almighty god for the sun rises with the scorching wind and it withers the grass the flower will fall the beauty will fade away so too will the rich man in the midst of his pursuits fade away but blessed are happy and spiritually prosperous and favored by god is the man who steadfast under trials who will hold the line who will persevere when they're tempted but when he has passed the test and been approved he will receive the victor's crown of life which the lord has promised to those who love him hallelujah so we can be happy in the middle of our trials we don't have to be depressed in the middle of our trials we don't have to be weary or down i don't understand there's there's human emotions and things but amen there has to be something greater than your human emotion they're asking you know i know people go on their emotions you know they get sick and they go on their emotions for a while but the only thing that will produce a healing is not an emotion the only thing that will produce a healing is faith in almighty god's word amen so many times we work on emotions we go out on emotions and we're up or we're down we're this way we're that way but that's unstable that's a double-minded man there's only one person that can have stability in this life is to take these imaginations and cast them down and exalt the word of god and say the word of god is true no matter who's in power the word of god's and true is true no matter how bad the world gets the word of god is true no matter how terrible things may seem around me the word of god has not failed it's not faltered it's not lost one one iota or fact or it's not lost the truth it's still the truth of the hour hallelujah you know i you know people and somebody i think actually brother tim sent me this i thought it was pretty good you know people were worried about the donkey and the elephant you know there's probably a lot on your mind tonight who's going to win the donkey or the elephant well to be honest with you i'm not worried about the donkey and the elephant i'm worried about the lamb let's think about the lamb tonight amen let's lay all these other things aside you know brother branham was talking to a man one time i was actually called it the atheistic doctor i think that means that my my my dictionary just timothy pruitt dictionary means an idiotic atheist doctor amen anyway atheiatic doctor in louisville i was down after coming back from africa and was giving me an examination for amoeba and and he began to rebuke brother branham said you don't believe in all that foolishness he said yes sir i believe in it he said you mean to tell me you mean you believe a man rose from the dead he said yes sir i believe it how can you prove he rose from the dead i can i said i can prove he's a resurrected christ he said i said he lives in my heart that's how i know it's here in here he changed me from a sinner to a christian he changed my nature he changed my attitude oh hallelujah can't have a nature change without an attitude change he changed my attitude he changed all that was in me and he made me a new creature therefore i know personally he rose from the dead he said well i believe he died he said well i do too but he but he died yea more than that he rose from the dead and he said and today he lives in our hearts that's why we're happy and can sing amen that's why we can rejoice no matter what's going on around us because he still lives hallelujah he still lives that's why we can notice him here not long ago jesus christ the son of god he said done such a great miracle for me in my own life he's done miracles for you he walks with you daily he walks with every believer hello i'm with you always to the end of the world no matter what comes or goes christ still lives no matter what comes or goes he still reigns in the human heart that's why he says the story said you watch every morning he said you get up grouchy and you get up and say well i just about got half the sleep i needed he said so forth no wonder we got high blood pressure and diabetes and everything he says no wonder he says look look at the little robber and he'll raise up the morning first thing he'd throw that little head back towards heaven and go to singing at the top of his voice he said you've never seen any of them with high blood pressure come on now you never seen them walking around on crutches and with diabetes no and little robin one time said to another said wonder what's the matter with people they're always got their head down they're always worried about this or word about that he see maybe they don't have a heavenly father that takes care of them come on somebody amen they're always concerned about everything going on around them maybe they don't have a heavenly father that takes care of them like we've got amen listen he takes care of every bird he takes care of everything around us he takes care of it all listen this whole world is still in his hands it's only producing an atmosphere amen for people to get in the atmosphere of an end time everything that we're seeing right now is only producing an atmosphere for an end time it's only producing an atmosphere for the antichrist to come it's only producing an atmosphere for the tribulation to take place it's only producing the right climate the right atmosphere the right everything for a rapture let's don't forget we got a heavenly father amen let's don't forget i got a god who owns the cows on the thousand he's he's owns the cows on a thousand hills he's more than able for any need any situation any problem that i go through amen he says see how many here are christians tonight all right i felt like i probably could get a minority here knowing you're christians there's something that you said that says you're a christian all right you say why you should be the happiest people in the world a christian should be the happiest people in the world not a democrat not a republican a christian ought to be the happiest people in the all in all the world you should just believe that he said that's easy take god's word for it we ought to be the happiest people in all the world why you can't lose hallelujah matters not what happens in this world you can't lose the christian has not one worry they should be the most freest happiest people in all the world why you can't lose all things can somebody say all things all things work together for the good to them that love god how many loves god and are they called according to his purpose who are they called in the house tonight [Music] i've heard the call of god in my life have you heard his call if you heard his call and you love him and yeah everything's working for your own good it's working for my leaving here hallelujah there's nothing to lose well what about this one there's nothing to lose we're anchored in jesus christ we are going home to glory well i thought i might get a few shouts on that one right there this is where our minds should be this is where it ought to be i'm on my way to glory and whoever is elected next is only just another pawn i'm on my way to glory amen settle your minds that'll settle your mind in a moment when you realize i have an ambition my ambition ain't a 401 k my ambition ain't to have the most the best house and the best and most land and most things and the most this that and the other that's not my ambition my ambition is i'm on my way out of here i'm leaving this whole world i'm ready to leave this place amen there's nothing worth staying here for and he said if you got that in your mind you might as well have a good time while you're going along hallelujah just like you were singing a while ago he'll take you through the fire again realize he's still in the fire he's still on the throne he's still able more than abel he's still here to meet needs according to his riches and glory hallelujah this god has not lost a battle god's providing everything he would say in another place and you know in people's minds or that's why i talked about stability unstable this is the most unstable time we've ever lived in i mean think about this year i don't know everybody's all about this year 2020. like i said before who says next year is going to be any better as far as you know earthly speaking maybe the greatest year this still may end up being the greatest year ever hallelujah he said in this great hour of darkness and chaos over the earth we should be the happiest people you know brother brother lafontaine used to say it like he said it best he's going on the glory i'm pretty sure he's a happy man right now amen but he used to say are you happy i mean he's happy well notify your face don't you look at your neighbor and say hey i'm happy i'm happy amen we should be the happiest people in the whole earth but i don't have this brother timothy what well i just read the scripture it talks about the man who's not news news who's lowly he said he ought to rejoice because he's been given the kingdom amen ought to be the happiest people in the whole earth to rejoice to know all the time and and all the time people are being doctor documented all kinds of isms things in the earth and yet today right here in the middle of all this darkness and all this chaos is a real living god and his real word and he's here by his visible evidence and he shows us he's we're we're with us working moving living acting just exactly as he always did what a privileged people we are i say it again what a privileged people we are hallelujah i i just was receiving a text from over in singapore from a man i met actually over in uh uh uh switzerland there just by chance met him and we exchanged numbers and he's a lutheran he sends me messages all the time of standing knocking on the door where luther had nailed the theses up and he's a and he's all about you know the the the roman catholic church and all this and being against it and all that you know i'm thinking well i've tried to show him down through the scriptures and all these things you know and trying to show him where he's even it and where he's even at and all these things you know and he's texting me what about the election what about this what about that and people are worried and they're stirred up their minds are tore up even over in singapore china all over the world they're tore up unstable what a privileged people we are i told the man i said i don't know what i would do if i wasn't a christian hallelujah to know that this world is not my home hallelujah i mean you can elect george washington and it'll never go back to what it was again this world is not my home i'm just a passing through but while i'm passing through i might as well have a good time cause i'm on my way home he said this in 62. he said he said i don't know how the canadian people are feeling now but the americans are putting on one of the biggest bluffs i've ever seen just like the rest of the world they're acting like they're not afraid but they're scared to death they're hiding in the hiding in the government all kinds of places digging down the ground reminds me of a little boy passing the graveyard at nighttime whistling saying he's awful brave he just whistle in the dark actions speak louder than words because the time has come where we'll not need military forces anymore just one fanatic to pull the trigger and the whole world will blow up i do not believe amen he said god cannot defeat his own purpose the earth was put here and there will be a millennial reign upon the earth for a thousand years that the church has done taken home amen he said but when those sights begin to come to pass lift up your head redemption draweth nigh don't look down and be weary we're just coming to the place for the coming of our lord jesus this is where we're at we're just coming to the place of the coming of our lord jesus that's nothing to be sad about unless you're not ready to go but i am in tonight if you find yourself worried and stressed out listen there's time to get ready lay aside every weight lay aside everything that's both so easily beset you and run the race we're just about home we're coming to the place for the coming of our lord jesus instead of being weary we should be the most happiest people in the whole world why and he says and we are why because we're not afraid of bombs bombs don't bother us i said the other day he said i said you can't dig far enough to get away from them this is a 62. you sure can't dig far enough away now blow your bones you can get down and concussions bones blow it apart 150 you know feet deep i mean you dig all you want to you're not going to get away from it but you know one good thing science can work out all kinds of things but god was way ahead of that we have a bomb shelter and it's not made out of steel it's made out of feathers hallelujah under his wings were resting and before it explodes we'll be out until going into a land where there's no sickness no sorrow no old age and will be forever renewed back to youth again and it will be that way forever therefore we ought to be the most happiest people on the face of this earth because my trust is not in a government it's not in what i can do i'm under some feathers shielded from the fiery darts of the enemy and when it comes cast them down cast them down cast them down well what what do we got to lose nothing what have we got to win everything we don't know how long it's going to last maybe gone by morning maybe our last time together listen this is how we ought to take every service it may be our last time together we have may have had our last youth camp together we may have had our last meetings big meetings together i don't know what the future holds but whether it is or whether it isn't we can't lose so therefore our minds don't have to get all worried and stewed up and stirred up amen no there's no way for a christian to lose you just can't lose no matter what there's no loss in a christian if i live i gain if i die i gain hallelujah there's no loss amen he talks about another place he said just to build the faith of the people just to get them built to a place where it gets all the scare away from them he said a christian has not one worry in the world hello somebody that's quite a statement how many count i wonder how many we could count of worries today that we had today maybe in the last five minutes one worry in the world we should be the most freest happiest people in all the world you can't lose all things work together for the good to them that love god how can we lose there's nothing too loose we're anchored in jesus we're just at the point of going home you know he would say at another place and i'm just going to lay a few of these things in to the covenant people he said whatsoever things you desire as a christian when you pray believe when you receive it and hold right on to it and it'll be given to you it will be given hold right on to it because god said it would do it i'm here as a confirmation i'm going away going back to the father the holy ghost will come and he will confirm everything i've said he will be with you he will continue this ministry till i return again and here we are sitting in the building tonight feeling the same holy ghost that fell on the day of pentecost the same holy spirit that led abraham the same holy ghost that performed the miracles in the early church the same signs the same wonders the same baptism the same results what we got to worry about god swore he'd do it you can't lose god said so it don't make any difference what anybody else says or what anybody else does we can't lose you know satan has spent his time taking the things of god and perverting them into evil things beginning to pervert things into evil instead of good when satan first done that god as soon as it was first done out of his great treasure trust of love he had a plan of redemption that quick he didn't have to sit down and think it all over and how it would be and how am i going to make this work and how am i going to get this back i mean how in the world satan he's done messed me up i i hear i had a wonderful evening and and and and i just out of nowhere here he comes and he just pulled the wool over my eyes no uh before it ever happened he knew how it would be he's infinite he had in his great heart how he'd bring all this about how if he foreknew the church he foreknew christ he foreign to the plan and he set it all in order and all the world turning around just according to his plan amen and you being dead yourself dead in christ alive after your dead yourself alive in christ god is working all things together for the good to them that love him so how can we lose when the infinite god who started all this is still here and he made this plan of redemption and it worked out perfectly according to his plan he foreshadowed it all through the scriptures he brought this one for this type and this one for that type and there ain't no way in the world we can sit there and make all that up god did it in his infinite knowledge bringing out of this one out of this one out of this and pre-planning you to be here by his foreknowledge amen god was so i mean so designed that he would bring you to this place for this certain age to live here and have a certain thing about you to do a certain way to have a certain nature to be a certain way amen to make you this or that or whatever his gifts he would give you or whatever he would like for you to be on the earth god had already planned it all out and therefore god knew exactly exactly how all of this was going to play out nothing is surprising god but there's only one loser in this whole thing you can't lose but satan will and everything that's under him will the devil will lose god will always win amen if you're on the wrong side sure you're going to lose but if you're on god's side which is the right side you will win you cannot lose hallelujah you know you take your sickness doctors are giving you up to die just say go home you know hospice just got a prayer request for a friend of mine who's just an acquaintance his mother's been given up to die to go home to hospice with ovarian cancer lee fox mother prayer request asking god to be merciful but you can't lose by trusting god you know he would he would brother talk about we know the story in the bible of of the of the of the lepers that sat by the gate there and said why do we sit here till we die let's go into the city and we know the story samaria was being seized by the syrians and they're so hungry they're starving them to death until they'd eat the bark off the ground off the off the uh a tree and grass off the ground and boil one another's children to eat lepers couldn't come in the city they were they were contagious why what they said we're going to die here or we can die there why sit here until we die let's go down the syrians if they kill us whatever we're going to die anyhow they had to take a chance but you know what that story was all about it was about faith they started down towards assyrians and just because they began to move under that faith and that inspiration god amen began to send a big rumble through the desert all the way down to the whole midst of them syrians so they got so confused by it all they ran away and left their tents and all their food and they found plenty to heat not only did it save their own life but the leopard saved the city's life i mean look what a chance they had to take and you don't even have to take that chance all you've got to do is trust god and you can't lose by trusting god you're not asked to go down to the camp of the enemy you're invited to the house of god who's waiting for you and there's no losing whether you be a leper whether it be sick whether it be this whether you be that there's no losing you are invited to the house of god [Applause] and god is here to perform his word there's no losing the only way you'll lose if you sit still and don't act amen but you're invited how many says it's true that if you sit there when the spirit of god's moving and you don't react you lose i mean think about the loss that the woman would have had who ended up touching jesus's garment when he come by if she'd just sit there or blind as we talked about last weekend about last wednesday about blind bartimaeus what if it says oh okay that's that's just somebody somebody trying to be somebody and he just let him go on by and and next thing you know he's out of sight out of earshot and it's over he'd have died a blind man he had a lot to lose by sitting there god won't fail us heavens and earth will pass away but his word won't fail god will not fail us you know he would it would going back to the greatest battle ever fought brother branham went to a
