lord and our hearts just burned within us or there be anything that we've done we just ask you to forgive us lord and wash us by your blood cleanse each and every heart lord draw us all closer to you fill every fiber of our bodies we ask it in jesus name amen let's turn to judges 6 and verse 7. amen judges 6 and verse 7 and it came to pass when the children of israel cried unto the lord because of the midianites that the lord sent a prophet unto the children of israel which said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel i brought you up from egypt i brought you forth out of the house of bondage and i delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of all that oppressed you and drove them out from before you and gave you their land and i said unto you and i said unto you i am the lord your god fear not the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but you have not obeyed my voice and there came an angel of the lord and set under an oak which was an oprah and pertained unto joash and his son gideon threshed wheat by the winepress and hid it from the midianites and the angel of the lord appeared unto him and said unto him the lord is with thee thou mighty man of valor and gideon said unto him o my lord if the lord be with us why then is all this befallen us and where be all his miracles which our fathers told of us saying did not the lord bring us up from egypt but now the lord hath forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the midianites amen we'll let you be seated we spoke just a couple of sundays ago on the days of miracles are here like to speak to you on the god of miracles the god of miracles and the god of miracles and god being a miraculous god and a god who does miracles is all through the scripture and of course you couldn't touch this tonight as far as the vastness of all of all the things that are in the in the bible that we can pull from but you know looking at this as as we see a people that had walked away from god and and forgot that who god was and forgot what he had told them to not fear that when the things they begin to fear begin to come upon them but the word was sent to them by the prophet and it was spoke if you read it there as we read the prophets came unto the children of israel and his words were this thus saith the lord god of israel i brought you out from egypt i brought you out of the house of bondage i delivered you from the egyptians and now the hand of those that oppressed you and i drove them all out from before you and i gave you the land and i said unto you i am the lord your god fear not the gods of the amorites and so it's amazing that he began to immediately tell him who he was and to remind them of who he was and what who he was and what god had done for them in that moment of the of their time of life and because what who god was is who god is and so what god done is what god does and this is what he was trying to show them i did this there but i'm also the same god today don't forget who i am god was reminding them to not forget that he is the god of miracles he wanted the he wanted his people to know he works miracles because if we look at the miracles that god done in the in what he was talking about and delivered them out of egypt and and and out of out of the house of bondage my just how many miracles did the children of israel see time after time god moving on the scene and and god producing miracles it was a miracle of how that he would take a river system and turn it into blood it was a miracle that he could take the dust of the earth and turn it into gnats or or to bring frogs to be so thick as they were miracle after miracle sign after sign after sign and then he brings them out of egypt and then the angel of god and a pillar of fire a pillar of cloud and fire guarded them or stood between them and the egyptians and then a strong wind made a path for them to go through the red sea and walk across on dry land that was what i consider a miracle amen and then the same deliverance that brought they were brought amen the egyptians tried to follow them and their chariot wheels were made to come off and the army the whole army was drowned in the sea right there before their very eyes and this is what he's telling them don't forget what i'd done for you when i delivered you from egypt because what i was is what i am and what i've done is what i do amen bitter waters were made sweet and drinkable manna rained down from heaven as bread quail were sent to provide meat water came from a rock time after time and followed them through the wilderness amen moses would raise his hands and the israelites would prevail over amalek god would speak lift to ear they would hear his voice from the mountain at sinai the winds would once again bring quail down into their midst you know miriam's rebellion and leprosy and god coming on the scene and healing her and then you know the ground opening and swallowing korra and all those that were with him the budding of aaron's staff the water amen from the rock the bronze snake on a pole the crossing of the jordan river that was a lot of miracles they witnessed amen you know just today as me and sister ruth were reading the bible together reading to once again how they came across jordan in the flood stage and how he told the priest to go out and walk out and stand in the middle of the jordan and god roll back one one side went down and the water continued because you know the red sea was pretty much a steel body but now we're working with a flowing river as it would continue to flow and and imagine how that wants to look to the kings of the of and the people of that land that the scripture said their their hearts melted within them when they saw what god had done and god took that and he and he let the the one side just went completely dry and the other side walled up water all the way back to a city and a miracle that god would work on the scene and here he was trying to remind them again i still do that i'm still a worker of miracles i'm still can move in impossible situations in other words these midianites are not too much for me all god needed was someone that he could work through amen and so we would look and we were acquainted with how amen how what what what was going on the philistines and the midianites and the amorites all the different ones that would come in and steal the blessings of the children of israel and the fear that would become upon them but did you notice they could not do that until israel first fell away from god or they lost their faith in god or they they lost that what god had told him he said don't fear them because i'm greater than they are but they forgot about how great he was how quickly and you know you've seen this the precursor of their lives so pretty much as they would go down through the through the wilderness and and they just very quickly how for how quickly they would forget how he opened the red sea how quickly they would forget how he gave him victory here and how he opened this and he done this and he went and he fed him here and he gave him how quickly they forgot and sometimes we get in the middle of a battle we get in the middle of situation and how quickly we forget who he is and we forget what god can do he said see when you can remember he said see remember this the devil can't set a foot on you to hurt you he said until first you get away from god now that may not be sin that maybe it's forgetting who he is or letting your faith waver or falling away just for a moment amen and pulling back and forgetting who he is and getting away from god but you first must remember this he said check it when it happens he said when the devil comes in see if you're in the faith or not see if you're right with with god or not and if you are then remember the devil cannot harm you hallelujah why you are in christ and anyone that's born again is in christ that does not mean that sickness won't come against you but it cannot harm you spirits will still come against you but they cannot harm you things will come against you and your body and your and your spirit and try to attach themselves to you but if you're in christ they can not harm you hallelujah and this place you know a few few years before we could read how how the prophetess deborah and and and bayrack would come and endeavor would prophesy and bayrock bayrack the great army the great warrior would triumph over the enemy but soon as they would get out of that he said they would get into a little twist again and right back into the rut they went again he said if that isn't the picture of our church today he said as soon as it gets out of one twist it goes into another hello somebody this is what we've seen the message do it get out of one twist and go into another twist get out of one thing go into another he said but the time had come for action the time had come is the same now it is a time for action it is a time it's come that play in church has come to a halt hello somebody playing churches come to a hall there's no more play in church we must get down to business with god and i trust that the same god will place us upon the heart of you tonight that in the time for his time for a halt to put play in church to quit playing religious quit playing righteousness and it's now time for action it's time to see god living in flesh it's time to see god's working as he did 2000 years ago not just an idea of theology and and be able to quote scriptures i better quote this the devil can quote scriptures the devil can quote quotes i'm talking about a life lived in front of the devil and when the devil comes you say not today satan no i'm a blood-bought son of god and this is not my voice you're hearing the voice of the creator you're hearing the voice of god speak back to you he knows he's heard it before but it's time to quit playing religious you know hey you know we live in a time that everybody's playing they're acting a lot of acting going on and and people have played and played the part of the message long enough sat on our own pews and played the part of the message played the part of religious play the part of righteousness and and playing along and he says but see when people god's people get in trouble god has sent them a prophet and it'll bring them back to the word again it's never a time that god's people ever got in trouble unless god sends them his word and his word is here for our deliverance once again hallelujah he said find out if it's a woman we said how do you know if it's the word tested according to the word then god's word becomes alive you say well you know i got we got this prophet in our church and we got this one as prophesied listen if it's a prophecy that's being prophesied and it don't come to pass you don't hear him if he's speaking words that don't happen or a life that can't be lived you don't listen to him but if that word has a life to back it up hallelujah a god called life to back it up that'll walk there and speak to the devil and cast him out and watch god move on the scene and watch god do the miraculous people want to call themselves prophets and yet they only get their prophecy right a few times and they got most of them wrong they prophesied this and they prophesy that and half the time or more is wrong well you're not you're a prophet all right it's called a false prophet but a true prophet of god will take you back to the word again you know get right in your place he'll get right right where you're living he'll get right down where the rubber meets the road and it don't always feel good and it all don't always i you know i you know it hurts but it's time to quit playing listen we're in a time that is time to quit playing you played long enough to come to church and you played long enough to have a certain dress code and you're playing and you tinker with things of the world and their dress code and you're right on the line it's time to quit playing it's time that we go in and we have a good house cleaning and we move all these things aside if we want to see god do the miraculous in our house get your house ready for the miraculous [Applause] amen if you want to see god do the miraculous in your own life get your life ready for the miraculous you don't come fill a dirty vessel amen god's people gets in trouble but he always sends them a prophet he always comes according to the word he said in every case he sends people a true servant a true prophet that will bring a true word of god a true word of god and the word of god is what delivers the people hallelujah now we can look back in the read there in 7th verse to the 10th verse and we find out that israel had turned away from god at the beginning of this chapter turned away from god and going back to the world again and out of nowhere came this prophet it don't even really give him a name i guess you know it wasn't it wasn't that wasn't the important part the important part was he spoke what god said amen he was anointed by god and he had a message on his heart and he called the people back to repentance to an understanding that their god was a god of might that their god was a god of deliverance that their god was a god of miracles and any true prophet will say the same thing today listen he's a god of miracles that snatched them out of the hands of the egyptians that opened up the red sea that failed have had them there in the wilderness a god of might that can take the land from somebody else and give it to them he's a god of might he's a god able yet more than able and these midianites and and amorites and so forth had come up to eat their land the enemy had challenged had set forth a challenge and this challenge must be met the armies couldn't meet it their priests couldn't meet it churches couldn't do it so the word of god came to meet the challenge amen he said the enemy may speak today and the enemy tries to say the days of miracles are passed the enemy tries to come and say there's no such a thing anymore as a true baptism the holy ghost it's only a motion it's only a work of the enemy has challenge and his challenge must be met there's only one way we can meet that challenge he said brother ryan said you don't meet him you know with it with with with your pl ds or llds or or being their trustee or deacon or a pastor no there's one requirement to meet this challenge wait in jerusalem until you're endued with power from on high that will meet the enemy's challenge hallelujah amen it ain't coming to this church going to meet the enemy's challenge it ain't listening to a certain amount of tapes that's going to meet the enemy's challenge or singing enough songs or do it it is being born again that is what's going to meet the enemy's challenge and once you're born again then church playing days are over with righteous playing days are over with hallelujah amen there'll be a power on the inside of dunamis a power on the inside that when you go out and you meet that devil he ain't got no right over you no more he can't come inside of you and take over you no more he can't take over your voice and your actions he can't take it over no more why there's somebody greater there hallelujah and when somebody's greater there the devil can't take over your dress no more he can't take over your hairdos no more and the way your actions no more he can't take over none of that no more he's lost his power that's the greatest miracle that could ever be done in your life it's the baptism of the holy ghost he didn't come with some man-made theology he come and said i am the lord that brought you out of egypt and showed my mighty hand and showed my power i am the god that did this saying i can imagine gideon listen to that prophet i've done all this yet you've not obeyed my voice and all this i've done it he said i want he said i want to tell you another thing that might encourage you immediately after that prophet's message the lord appeared on the scene hello somebody i want you to understand we've had a prophet visit our generation and the lord is on the scene hallelujah as soon as he gave his message the lord appeared and the lord came down and the message of the prophet amen as he spoke and sat under a tree all people had fallen away people had went into their isms but god had sent his prophet and the lord followed the prophet's and it was a message for deliverance oh hallelujah this is what this message is church it ain't a message of your rules and regulations and how to's and why not to it is a message for your deliverance it is a message for an exodus it is a message for getting you out of here it is a message for breaking off the chains of slavery not putting slavery on you breaking slavery off of you here we see though gideon scared out in the wine press thrashing out enough wheat before the philistines or midianites found him little grove had a little had ordered a little grub for the winter thrashing it out secretly so they wouldn't find him because they would come in like grasshoppers and take everything they had you know it's just the way the devil does get a little something started in the church and here the devil comes in and tries to take it all away tries to tear it all down listen he said see it comes in like grasshoppers taking away what had been given gideon being a scriptural man now listen how he puts this being a scriptural man when the angel of the lord appeared to him and he said the lord capital l o r d it was not an angel it was god a theophany in the form of god appear like it appeared to abraham and looked like a man acted like a man but it was something greater than a man and it came down to bring a message of deliverance and gideon asked the scripture because he was a scriptural man that kind of man that god comes to somebody who knows what he's talking about gideon said if god be with us if you're truly a messenger where are the miracles because he knew if he was god he was a god of miracles how far away us message people have gotten away from that we don't want to we don't accept these a god of miracles for some reason we we want to act like it's some other day past or some other day in the future listen it's today what he did is what he does what he was is what he is hallelujah if we can say it we're gonna we have to deny the scripture hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever to not believe god is a god of the miraculous right now that if he's a god of the miraculous what's wrong with me expecting him to be what he is [Music] he said because if you how can you expect god today to work among people this is a direct quote who doesn't even believe in miracles but he says it's a good way he said gideon had a good way to trust whether the messenger was right or not if he has a form of godliness he will deny the power to do those miracles but if he's a messenger from god he'll not only speak it he'll produce it hallelujah to show that the god that he talks about is with him and in him hallelujah listen how scriptural listen he said listen how scriptural gideon was and otherwise he said we understand that god is a great god of mighty workings he's a god of miracles and if he's for us if he's with us if he is the same yesterday today and forever where how can i see his miracles where can i see this god in action i want to see him in action and i believe that ought to be our desire every service every day of our lives god i want to see you in action and i believe we have seen him in action god moving on to miraculous and changing lives and changing the direction of someone changing things in a moment and twinkling of an eye he is the god of miraculous wherever a supernatural being is he will do supernatural signs because the supernatural is in him you can't get away from it how can you stand in the wind without the wind blowing how can you get in the water without being wet and when you get in the presence of god the supernatural is going to be there the supernatural signs the supernatural workings of a supernatural god if god's there the supernatural is present then all things are possible then the sick can be healed the death can be raised you know that's what they said about the disciples said they they they could they could see that they had been with jesus how because they was doing the works jesus did things were being produced out of them because the life jesus was was now living on the inside of them and the miraculous was following him signs and wonders follow them that believe it just happens that's the way it goes it's a word of god you can't do nothing about it devil hallelujah he said where is the working where's the miracles of god be with us oh hallelujah that's it where god is miracles are right here hallelujah how many miracles we got in the house today where god is miracles are where god is healing is where god is deliverance is where god is salvationist gideon didn't realize that the man sitting there was just a man all he knowed he was just a man that's all he could see was a man but he said if you're if god's with us then there's going to be miracles how scriptural that is for where the supernatural god is his sign will be with him where god is the sign of god is with god we know that if he is in his people they will do his signs hello somebody if he is in his people they will do his signs what is his signs they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover they shall tread on serpents and shall not harm them what was the signs the dead were raised miracles so everywhere he went miracles took place and we get to this point and we say well we know we you know we're not going to major on that that's a minor well i want everything god has and quit making that an excuse for your lack of faith believe if he's here he can do what he said he would this is where gideon was if he's here then he's going to do what he said he would do that was the whole point of his question that he wasn't questioning if god could do it he's just asking if you're god then there has to be miracles this is what he was asking he said then where is his miracles if the supernatural god is here where is the supernatural works of god that could be easily said tonight he said amongst our churches where is the god that wants to live did he die ask that question did he die 50 years ago 60 years ago no people's faith got away from him and they got into theology and got into you know into intellectualism and learning and and got all puffed up and and couldn't hardly do nothing when it come to the spiritual works of god and to believe that anything god could do god will do i understand there's been all kind of people impersonate somebody said maybe brother tim the other day i i believe they ought to be impersonating us hello i believe as a church of god and as a people of god we ought to have something they want to impersonate that they see something real on the inside of that church they they see a life there and they see god moving on the scene they see god in action and people today don't want you to testify because they say well you're just puffing yourself up i'm not puffing myself up it wasn't me that done it [Music] i'm telling you who he is it was god that come in this house and healed a young woman of cancer it was god who come in this place and put hair back on a little girl it was god who come in the hospital room and gave my mom her life back and how dare you tell me i can't testify he is the god of the miraculous he is a god and what he did he will do and what he wants he still is today if he healed cancer 50 years ago then bob we ought to go ahead and believe him he'll do it again nothing too hard for this god i'm going to ask some people who who left and left you in charge tell us we can't testify we can't tell what god has done we can't lift up a god out of history to let a dying world know he's still god he's still the same yesterday today and forever let me tell you something you out there critics you get cancer one time you're gonna want this god people say well i ain't gonna believe in no miraculous as long as a doctor was involved that's a bunch of nonsense shows just how far your intellectual has taken you down here you say are you angry brother yeah i'm angry people there's a challenge out there but there's a people here to arise to the challenge and there's a god here to back it up he said he's the same he said did he die is he gone is he off on a trip somewhere no sir he's the same yesterday today and forever and if we say we're of god then let's see where god is let's see the signs of god if this tabernacle stands for god let's see god moving among us let's see souls being born into the kingdom of god let's see lives being straightened up let's see the sick being healed and the blind being brought back to sight the death here and again let's see his mighty works perform if god is in our midst if god is with his people and in his people that person can't help but do the same thing god did i know that choked some of them intellectuals out there but that was a quote let me read that again if god is with his people and in his people they cannot help but do the same thing that god did that's right because it's not the person anymore it's god living in a people oh hallelujah that's what jesus would say if you don't believe me believe the signs that i do they was told there would be a prophet like moses raised up and he would be a messiah and he said if you cannot do if i do not the works of my father then don't believe me i'm wrong but if i do the works of my father and you don't believe me then believe the works what does the works do they tell you who i am they testify me they're my witness not my credentials that i belong to a certain religion or i belong to a presbyterian pentecostal message i can show my fellowship card with the works that i do the signs of god the signs of messiah they are the ones that testify of him and jesus said he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also if god be for us where are the miracles if god be in us what's the matter with us then something's wrong somewhere yes jesus said if i if you can believe me what i say watch what testifies with me for they're the one that gives witness of me the lord your god said there'd be a prophet raise up and here i am but you don't believe me but believe the works and they could see him do the things only god could do and yet they could not believe that's the word of the blind man where he created the eyeballs that's one of my favorite moments where jesus moved in in a miraculous way the creator once again working in creation taking some mud and spitting on it and putting it in his eyeballs i wonder how many would have stayed in that church service we got a lunatic hello we got a lunatic spitting in some clay putting in some man's eyes he says go wash and he came back to see him and then begin to question him and and and come against him for testifying of what who are you to come against the blind man's testimony when he was the blind one but now you can see these are his parents and they're like well don't ask us ask him it happened to him and the man makes one of the most astounding statements that should have shook them to their roots and down into their very soul he said never before the world has ever been that a man been born blind been given his sight yet you don't know who he is 30 minutes ago i didn't even have eyeballs but yet now i got elbows and i can see you and i can see my family for the first time and you don't know who he is and we've seen the miraculous done in such a phenomenal form in this age that we're living in and people are casting it down and making fun of it amen god have mercy on the hearts get in standing there oh if that big god that's with us i want to see the sign of god and he goes get an offer and he brings it there and he lays it before him and the angel said go i'll wait he said what was he doing he was testing it gideon come with some broth and bread with meat and the angel said now you understand by this this will prove it and he poured the ground the broth out on the ground for a drink off and he took the bread and meat and laid it on a rock where he was thrashing that and took a stick from his hand like an old man a stab and touched it and when he touched it the smoke went out and the sacrifice was consumed what was it he took him back to the scriptures to prove who he was hallelujah and he said if god still remains god if god is the same god he wasn't a days gone by you don't have to go up and shake hands with a preacher you don't have to go put your name on a book them things are alright nothing against them but of god big god lay yourself on the altar and see what he'll do with your sacrifice lord spoke to me very plainly said ask those young people ask them if god be god where is your miracle where's the life change in your life you say oh god's god i'm here to worship me where's your miracle at if god be god to you why are you still cutting your hair why are you still wearing makeup why are you still doing the things that god's word declares you shouldn't do you hadn't seen the miracle oh i've seen him heal cancer i've seen him but where's the your miracle at that's the miracle we need [Music] oh that's all you're talking about is a god of somebody else or a god of history but god wants to be your god he said well god's my god what not the god of the bible because if the god of the bible was your god then you would do what the god of the bible said then the miraculous would be worked in your life hallelujah he was the god of the old testament he's the god of the new testament he's the god today same yesterday today and forever and you know when down in your heart that supernatural work that's been done by a supernatural being you know when that happens oh yeah well you once drank you want smoke you once lied you you women once loved the world you kept wearing your makeup and short hair doing other things you did you find out that something else has happened and when that happens all the devils in hell couldn't make you do it again amen hello somebody because something has happened there was a one time some of you couldn't help yourself you couldn't help smoking a cigarette you couldn't help drinking a drink you couldn't help doing the things of this world but then a life change come on the inside and the devil come again to try to but he couldn't make you do it not one more time why because something happened there was an experience that took place it was a life-changing moment a miraculous a miracle was performed what happened he changed your vile heart he changed your desires he changed your nature a supernatural word by a supernatural god made a creature of time into a creature of eternity he took the world out of you and put christ in you and now it's the hope of glory filled with the spirit and ready to meet him if god be in you where is the sign of the messiah if god be god where is his miracle in you if god this is what he said with the methodist church why is if god be god in the methodist church he says why is all the women still wearing bobbed hair he said if god be god in the baptist church why does pastors still smoke cigarettes why do they still deny the power of god to heal the sick to raise the dead to speak in tongues to interpret tongues the gift of prophecy why do they still desire deny it if god of the old testament the god of the new testament is still the same god if god of the new testament the holy ghost is still the god the pentecostal claim why do they break down their walls and petition and fuss them and become born-again christians oh my they go through all kinds of sensations you see they go through all kinds of things but still have creeds and dogmas and fussing popularity contests devils of the world blind is from the real truth of god people fall blindly around it against some sensation and come right back up with an arrogant spirit indifferent fussy high tempered that's not the spirit of god still continue right on out of water but of god be god uses this example that's so wonderful he says if the clouds are hanging over the sun that doesn't mean the sun is shining or isn't shining the sun is always shining the only thing that keeps it from shining on you is clouds and if you get rid of the clouds the sun will shine he said brother get away from your sin get away from your doubts get away from your frustrations the sun has been shining since the day of pentecost hallelujah it rose in such a manner and it's still shining the s-o-n the holy ghost is just as great today as it ever was he said but denominations and men's creeds comes and try to smother out that sun and smother out the word of god say it's for another day miraculous for another day divine healings for the millennium divine healing is back there it doesn't pertain to that how can it be the same yesterday today and forever and still divine healing be gone how can the power the bible that once said it in order amen first apostles prophets evangelists pastors vindication and vindication that the gospel still lives and god sends them right among us and we turn our back on it god doesn't fail it's the people that's failed the night and they said where are the miracles where are they at he said they're still there just get the clouds out of the way get the doubts out of the way get the things out of the way that's hindering the sun from shining amen the sun by command of god shines every day it's there because god commanded it to be there not not all the time do you see it why he said clouds come in fog comes in and it begins to cover it up and you wonder am i going to make it another day and you get all down in your frustrations and you get all down in your aggravation and things and mind battles and you wonder is it still shining yes it's still shining god still does some miraculous god still changes lives god's still to move that thing off of you in a moment if you'll let him you want to see the miracle of god move your doubt out of the way move your creed out of the way move your denomination out of the way the sons are still shining it's a commandment of god he's the same yesterday today and forever and as long as he's to be there forever he's there no question about it where are the miracles what's happening in the miracles god sent christ christ is alive forevermore and wherever two or three are gathered in my name i'll be in their midst lo i'm with you always to the end of the world there's this problem what's the matter then it's we've let clouds of doubt and greed and temper and selfishness and other things break in on us and take us away from the word he said but the sun is still shining he said they're denying the true baptism of the holy ghost but the sun is still shining they're denying the days of miracles are here but the sun is still shining oh hallelujah they're denying that he's the lord god that heals all our diseases but the sun is still shining they're denying that that they're saying mercy's over but the sun is still shining oh hallelujah amen they're saying that ain't no such a thing as a move of the holy spirit no more but the sun is still shining the power of god is still here because he's still here and if he's still here the miraculous is still here healing is still here deliverance is still here it's all here everything in this book is here for you tonight what's happened to your joy you've allowed clouds to come over right you've allowed something to come and hinder you why ain't i felt the mood why ain't i felt the sun because you've allowed clouds to come over why hadn't they not seen the miraculous because they allowed the midianites to take over all god was waiting on was one person to grab something and go to work and god was going to answer he showed it already many times all through the scripture he just needs one person but clouds of doubt and selfishness break in on us and it takes us away from our position but that don't mean the sun ain't still shining it's still shining for you so brother timothy i've been in a real moment of just a a real rut and it just seemed like i can't get my head out of the sand it seemed like i can't move forward anymore it seems like the sun's still shining just move the doubt back go to praising god anyhow say god you're still god you're still the same yesterday today and forever this is this little thing i'm going through that doesn't mean that you're not god it doesn't mean you're not the same it doesn't mean you don't work the miraculous you're still there for me you're still there for my family oh yeah you start thinking along that line it'll change your whole thought pattern then it'll change the realm around you and all of a sudden the clouds will start breaking back and you'll see the sun again oh hallelujah that's what's the matter things begin to come upon us as christians and we begin to deny and we begin to move back we begin to let satan take this part and that part the sun's still shining the miraculous is still moving i don't care how many message preachers say it ain't so it's still moving things are still happening healings are still taking place why it can't help but take place because god's still here they can deny the christian baptism they can deny that the movement of the spirit they can admire deny them altar calls they can deny all they want to the sun's still shining god is still moving god is still working and if anybody ought to know it we ought to know it hallelujah in the face of it all and it ain't a strange thing you know a real miracle is this bible that in the face of it all the face of all denominations in the face of all the critics the bible still remains the same how did it ever weather the storm god determined it would be so he determined this word would stand that's why he would have such faith he said heavens and earth may pass away but this word will never pass away hallelujah he says see you take the clouds away what happens the sun is still there amen it's not saying oh jesus come and heal me oh jesus give me the holy ghost just move the clouds away it's still there you are still there why are you still here some of you this week even thought about giving up but why are you still here some of you this week the thought well you know this is gonna be my last time to go to church why are you still here because you were declared to be here there was a word that was spoke about you and god is so sure that you won't fail and you will come to pass because it's not you that liveth it's he that liveth on the inside of you and the devil's trying to cloud you over and the devil's trying to put the pressure and the devil trying to put all kinds of things upon you but just keep moving it back just keep fighting through it the sun is still shining god is still working the miraculous and he'll work one for you if you could just brush the clouds back the sun's already there the sun remains the same and christ remains the same we move away from him sometimes but he remains the only thing you have to do is turn yourself back and face him and see what takes place face christ face his word and see what takes place it'll be no more one day you're saved the next day your backslid that one day you're up one day you now know it'll be something has taken place it won't be well i spoke in tongues i danced in the spirit i don't know something took place god came and he brought a stability in my life and he said when that happens you will never turn to darkness hallelujah you know god is wanting somebody in this age as he had in every age you can read it we ain't got time to go through and all of them but just go through the scriptures very quickly in your mind he just needed somebody that would act upon his word and then if he could get somebody to act upon the word the word would come to pass all he needed was nowhere to act upon build an ark it's going to rain and when noah began to build an ark and began to act upon it before he even seen god's miracle he never seen rain before he didn't even science didn't even couldn't even prove it was there nothing but he began to act upon the word of god and god is once again looking for a people to act upon it he said i don't feel like it well noah didn't always feel like hammering another nail in the ark he didn't get up every day feeling like building an ark but he just acted upon it he began moving one day at a time one day at a time another board here another board there another tree here another tree there one day at a time moving all the way down acting upon what god had spoke because he knew if god spoke it god would bring it to pass hallelujah and this is what he's looking for us in our day it's somebody to act upon it you don't always feel it you don't always feel like a miracle you don't always feel the miraculous gideon didn't feel it but the miraculous was sitting right next to him right there and he didn't feel it just you know yesterday i was able to welcome my mom home after being almost four weeks in the hospital from a terrible brain bleeding taking just incredible things you had to go through i can remember the night we got the news i didn't feel a murmur i didn't feel a miracle i i didn't feel all supernatural i didn't feel i it just hit me like a weight of the world all of a sudden now i'm looking at maybe looking you're you know the thoughts go every kind of direction and you're trying to gather them back and trying to hold them together and trying to hold yourself together you don't always feel miraculous when the miraculous is right there hit my knees and begin to call out to god grabbed my stuff out of the motel room in there a couple of hours grabbed it walked out the door handed my key said i got to go didn't even start of say a word to the person there at the desk and we just left driving home probably i know i scared my wife happy to have to death one moment you're crying one moment huh one moment were you crying one moment when you're angry angry at the devil and mad and driving mad the miraculous was taking place riding who didn't even know it carter was staying on the highway wiping tears and wife saying you want me to drive let me drive i'm all right i'm going down and i'm not feeling the miraculous but yet the miraculous is happening the miraculous has taken place things are getting going in order in god's order and i know i'm looking at it i'm thinking god where are you at god's saying i'm not here [Applause] you might be tonight you don't mind you might have come to church and you ain't felt a bit of the miraculous but the miraculous is sitting right next to you the power of god is in the building to change your scene forever [Applause] i can remember my mom sitting over in germany in a meeting and the night before had been she'd been going through the change of life and the night before been up all half the night because my dad was in conference with some of the brothers there and discussing things and she was all worried and tore up and and she wasn't feeling the miraculous she was feeling worry and dread and fearful but right there was a miraculous and right there in that meeting the next night but ron spitzer walks down and calls her out says sister karen god saw you ring in your hands and he said the one who started the work is going to finish it and i'm going to tell you that lady come back home a different woman god came on the scene in a miraculous way hallelujah amen and i saw him in just these last couple of weeks the miraculous yes we started seeing the miraculous we started seeing but it took something to act upon it i talked to my dad just yesterday as we sat there in that living room again and i said dad you remember just a few days ago about three weeks almost four weeks ago we sat in them two chairs wondering what the next steps was wondering what the our future was wonder what mom's future i said look at us now look at us now as we rejoice over over what god has done for us but i'll never forget because that moment when i was talking to him on the phone it just welled up in me as i said don't forget you had that dream when that man come on shot you point blank and he missed the devil is missed and we saw amen the effects of his miss he tried his best but he lost he tried to do everything he could but he lost he tried to take her life but he lost he tried to take her voice but he lost he tried to take her actions but he lost he tried to take her dance but he lost hallelujah holy needs is one person to act upon us amen the devil is trying to destroy you and destroy your marriage and destroy your life and destroy your children he needs somebody to act upon it and say no sir devil i'm standing upon the word of god god is in our midst i see it moving among us i see the miraculous taking place and god is the same yesterday today and forever we ought to be like this this duck i trust we got some real ducks in the house tonight oh mercy i ain't got time go read the bible there's all kind of people who acted david jonah daniel three hebrew children all the way down and jonah he said when he seen god's miracle somehow there was oxygen in that fish and he breathed normally for three days took a nice little rest and a ride so he could take his 40-day journey across to a wicked city to preach the gospel he said what was it he said it was some oxygen out of heaven and that fish he said oh same god tonight he said oh breathe on us lord tonight the oxygen of the word of god and the power of his resurrection that we can stay alive in this last wicked day breathe on us oh holy spirit that's it brother breathe lord fill us with that heavenly oxygen he said like a duck he said soon as he smelt water there wasn't nothing could keep him from it all the cluckings of the hens and everything else he went straight to the water why he was a duck he said if any of you got duck nature when you get a big pool if you smell it you get a whiff you'll jump right in it he said if you are of god and you get a whiff that god remains the same you get a wealth and god is still doing the miraculous that god is still a miracle working god amen if you hadn't received the holy ghost yet and would you smell that water the first thing he'll do is he'll repent from the bottom of his heart he'll lay himself on an altar and he'll until he consumed to the holy ghost and been baptized in the name of jesus christ and he'll fill you but he said you got to be willing to go to the water oh hallelujah he said what happened he said gideon after his visitation sitting there he had been questioning but now he saw god was god he said god was the same god as he was there in the days of abraham as he was in jacob as he was in israel as he was and now he's he's acting and living in a present tense right now he said oh brothers and sisters when you realize he ain't a god of past tense no more he ain't a god of uh back then somewhere he ain't a god of history he's a god of today he says when you that when you realize that he said you'll be like that old duck i smell the miraculous i said i was born for the miraculous he mean why's the duck go to water because he's born for the water hey man you don't see a deer
