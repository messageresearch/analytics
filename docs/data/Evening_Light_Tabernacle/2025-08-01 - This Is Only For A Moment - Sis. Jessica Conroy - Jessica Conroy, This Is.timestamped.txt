[0:01] [Music]
[0:16] When I can understand my father's
[0:20] leading
[0:24] and it seems to be a hard and a cruel
[0:28] fate.
[0:31] Still I hear that gentle whisper
[0:35] pleading.
[0:38] God is working. God is faithful. Only
[0:43] wait.
[0:45] I am with you. I will never leave you.
[0:52] This is for my glory.
[0:55] You are a testimony.
[1:00] of my power,
[1:03] of my love. Oh my sweet, sweet life.
[1:09] Lift your head up high
[1:13] and one day you'll see.
[1:17] Why it had to be this way.
[1:21] This is only for a moment.
[1:26] [Music]
[1:29] If my eyes are on the sparrows and I
[1:33] make the flowers grow,
[1:37] trust me when I tell you it's all in my
[1:42] control.
[1:44] For you are my beloved. I do all things
[1:48] for your good. Oh my child.
[1:53] Oh my child,
[1:56] I am with you. I will never leave you.
[2:03] This is for my glory.
[2:06] You are a testimony
[2:11] of my power,
[2:13] [Music]
[2:14] of my love.
[2:17] Oh my sweet sweet.
[2:20] Lift your head up high and one day
[2:25] you'll see
[2:28] why it had to be this way.
[2:31] This is only for a moment.
[2:35] [Music]
[2:39] Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
[2:44] look full in his wonderful ways and the
[2:47] things of this world will grow strangely
[2:50] dim in the light of his glory and grace.
[2:54] I am with you. I will never leave you.
[3:00] This is for my glory.
[3:03] You are a test. Don't know me.
[3:08] Of my power, of my love. Oh my sweet,
[3:12] sweet, I lived your head of mine. And
[3:16] one day you'll see why it had to be this
[3:20] way.
[3:22] And I'll hold you in my arms and wipe
[3:26] your tears
[3:28] [Music]
[3:29] away.
[3:35] This is only for a moment.
[3:42] [Applause]
