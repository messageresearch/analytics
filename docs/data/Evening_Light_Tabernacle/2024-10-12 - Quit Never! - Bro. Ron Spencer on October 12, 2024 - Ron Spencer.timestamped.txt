[1:06:09] spotless you know we are living in a day
[1:06:12] and an hour where many things are
[1:06:17] happening and even recent developments
[1:06:20] that are taking place we all know of the
[1:06:22] seven visions that brother Bram had in
[1:06:25] 19
[1:06:26] 1933 and we know three of them has
[1:06:29] already been fulfilled it led up to
[1:06:31] World War II that was concerning mellan
[1:06:34] and Hitler communism and so on like
[1:06:38] that and it was prophesied exactly to
[1:06:41] the dot these have been
[1:06:43] [Music]
[1:06:44] fulfilled and
[1:06:46] um and now we're right here on the verge
[1:06:50] of the fourth one that is happening
[1:06:52] right now that shows great advances in
[1:06:56] science that would come after the second
[1:06:58] world war it was headed up in the
[1:07:01] vision something he called an egg shaped
[1:07:04] car the word AO Dynamics was probably
[1:07:07] not even
[1:07:09] known and you know
[1:07:12] we this
[1:07:13] week Tesla who leads the way at hands
[1:07:17] off driving with more than 9 billion
[1:07:22] miles have been driven with autopilot
[1:07:26] engaged Elon mus come out and said by
[1:07:31] 2026 he will have this on the
[1:07:34] road and it will be without a steering
[1:07:37] wheel set un an unsupervised full
[1:07:41] self-driving future is what we
[1:07:45] want we're talking about just a little
[1:07:48] over a year from
[1:07:50] now you know he saw women rising in
[1:07:53] power and and and the great immorality
[1:07:57] that would happen in the world and the
[1:07:58] perversion that has taking place and we
[1:08:02] are in that hour where it is now Total
[1:08:06] [Music]
[1:08:07] Insanity and brother brandham said and I
[1:08:10] saw a great woman stand up beautiful
[1:08:13] looking dressed in high highly Royals
[1:08:18] light
[1:08:19] purple and I got little parentheses down
[1:08:23] here she's a great ruler in the United
[1:08:25] States for perhaps the Catholic Church a
[1:08:27] woman some woman I don't know her to be
[1:08:29] the Catholic church I don't know I can't
[1:08:31] say that only thing I've seen I've seen
[1:08:33] the woman that was all that she would
[1:08:35] lead our
[1:08:36] nation to complete ruination well we
[1:08:40] have
[1:08:41] both we we have the one as he said she
[1:08:45] would be either president or vice
[1:08:47] president she's already vice president
[1:08:50] this is her inauguration described
[1:08:53] exactly Royal purples
[1:08:56] and Mr Biden the first Catholic
[1:09:00] President since
[1:09:03] Kennedy and so they're already there
[1:09:05] it's already in place I'm just telling
[1:09:08] you things are in
[1:09:11] position and and maybe she won't even
[1:09:14] have to become
[1:09:15] president maybe this election will it
[1:09:18] won't even be
[1:09:20] her but I I just maybe it's they've
[1:09:25] already done the
[1:09:26] damage to bring us into
[1:09:30] ruination what I'm trying to tell you is
[1:09:32] we're closer than what you
[1:09:35] think and that we're nearer now than
[1:09:37] when we first
[1:09:39] believe whatever the next Vision shows
[1:09:42] smoke bombs craters all over the land of
[1:09:46] America and I want to tell you you must
[1:09:48] get in the presence of the pillar of
[1:09:51] fire like Moses did and meet God by the
[1:09:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost it may not be
[1:09:59] something visible you see you know uh
[1:10:02] because ever occurrence in the scripture
[1:10:04] when the Holy Spirit come they didn't
[1:10:06] always see tongues of fire or pillars of
[1:10:10] fire but he was still
[1:10:13] there because the same lifechanging
[1:10:16] results took place you remember and I'm
[1:10:20] quoting now from why Christ speaks
[1:10:22] brother Bram said when Moses met this
[1:10:24] Burning Bush
[1:10:26] that word was Vindicated exactly it was
[1:10:29] the word Moses didn't have to worry
[1:10:31] what's this voice all about what does
[1:10:34] this being here because God had already
[1:10:36] wrote in scripture in Genesis your
[1:10:39] people will so Jour in This Strange Land
[1:10:42] and they'll be brought back after 400
[1:10:44] years will come back into the country
[1:10:46] again for the iniquity of the amorites
[1:10:48] is not yet fulfilled now hundreds and
[1:10:52] hundreds of years before God had said
[1:10:53] that Israel would so J
[1:10:55] and be mistreated in a strange country
[1:10:58] and would stay there 400 years but God
[1:11:02] with a mighty hand would bring them
[1:11:04] out and Moses knew this intellectually
[1:11:07] and I I I just want to say about this we
[1:11:10] can look and see Israel's in her
[1:11:13] Homeland we can see she is the
[1:11:16] burdensome Stone of the world we can see
[1:11:20] demonic Powers rising up coming against
[1:11:24] her to D destroy her we see we see
[1:11:29] alliances being made with with with
[1:11:33] nuclear uh threats that is being made
[1:11:36] from Russia and China I'm just telling
[1:11:38] you you know you know you can connect
[1:11:41] the
[1:11:42] dots you you can look and see where
[1:11:45] we're at in time and the vision has
[1:11:49] already spoke about where we would be
[1:11:52] here in this last day Sodom and gamar
[1:11:55] around us perversion
[1:11:58] everywhere and so he said you know in
[1:12:01] this he said he tried to the ECT though
[1:12:04] intellectual experience with the word to
[1:12:06] try to bring them out to deliver them
[1:12:09] because he knew he was born for that
[1:12:11] purpose he knew the time and the
[1:12:13] scripture said it' already been 400
[1:12:15] years and he said just as now as a man
[1:12:19] asked me about to come in the Rapture
[1:12:21] we've lived the time
[1:12:23] out at the time of the Rapture is at
[1:12:26] hand and we're looking for a Rapture and
[1:12:29] faith that have pulled the church
[1:12:30] together to give it some Supernatural
[1:12:34] strength that can change these bodies
[1:12:36] that we live in when we see a God that
[1:12:39] can raise the dead off the floor and out
[1:12:42] of the yard and bring him back to life
[1:12:44] again and present him before us when we
[1:12:47] see a God that can take a cancer that's
[1:12:51] eat a man to Shadow and raise him up to
[1:12:54] his strong strong healthy man that ought
[1:12:57] to give rapturing Faith to the people
[1:13:00] that when that light flashes from the
[1:13:02] sky and the trumpet sounds the body of
[1:13:05] Christ will be quickly gathered together
[1:13:08] and changed in a moment in a twinkling
[1:13:11] of an eye and taken into the
[1:13:13] heavens now when Moses saw he'd been
[1:13:17] raised up for this purpose and he had
[1:13:19] met face to face this God who had made
[1:13:22] the call and anointed him and identified
[1:13:25] him said this is your call Moses I'm
[1:13:27] sending you I'm going to show you my
[1:13:29] glory and here I am in a bush burning go
[1:13:33] down there I'll be with you he didn't
[1:13:35] need a stick he had the word the
[1:13:38] Vindicated word and it anointed the
[1:13:40] faith that was in him and it anoints us
[1:13:44] when we see that we're living in the
[1:13:46] last days to find out all these signs
[1:13:49] that we've been seeing taking place as
[1:13:51] spoken the scripture would take place in
[1:13:54] the last day all the way from Heaven to
[1:13:56] the political Powers the nature of the
[1:13:59] people the demoralization of the world
[1:14:01] and among women and how they would do in
[1:14:03] the last day and how men would do and
[1:14:05] how churches would do and how nations
[1:14:07] would do and how God would do and we see
[1:14:09] it laying right here on us oh it anoints
[1:14:13] our faith it moves us out in great
[1:14:16] Cycles it separates us from other things
[1:14:19] of the
[1:14:20] world and I want to say
[1:14:23] tonight that but here we are and I just
[1:14:26] want to
[1:14:27] say you know where wherever you are in
[1:14:30] life cycle it's time to move into that
[1:14:34] Rapture realm into the cycle of the
[1:14:37] Rapture where that you are changed first
[1:14:40] from the inside
[1:14:41] out and where that Faith rises in your
[1:14:45] heart to believe every Divine promise
[1:14:49] you know it's a shame anymore where
[1:14:51] people don't even know what a prayer
[1:14:53] line is people people never hear
[1:14:55] speaking in tongues or manifestations of
[1:14:58] the spirit it's all gone it's all passed
[1:15:01] we just become theologians and
[1:15:04] intellectual it's a shame when the
[1:15:06] supernatural is no longer made manifest
[1:15:09] among the people but I want to tell you
[1:15:11] the Rapture will be a supernatural event
[1:15:15] it will not be an event done by
[1:15:17] theologians it'll be the power of the
[1:15:20] Living God and it'll take another
[1:15:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost that will just
[1:15:25] search within you and change you in a
[1:15:28] moment in the twinkling of an eye I'll
[1:15:30] tell you what we need to get ready for
[1:15:32] an outpouring of the spirit and say God
[1:15:35] one more time fill this Temple move in

[1:26:03] thank you guys for being with us this is
[1:26:06] a this is an anniversary of sorts for us
[1:26:10] as a
[1:26:11] family last year my daughter was here
[1:26:14] sister Whitney and she had brought Zoey
[1:26:17] with us and Zoe was born with a
[1:26:20] condition that was called a aaia and
[1:26:23] aaia is a condition to where that
[1:26:25] there's a disconnect between the brain
[1:26:27] and the vocal cords and the and the
[1:26:30] tongue and she would just be mumbling
[1:26:32] and and we had prayed for her many times
[1:26:35] and beli for the promise of the Lord and
[1:26:38] and uh she was seeing some of the best
[1:26:41] Specialists that there was and they were
[1:26:43] telling us that she would be in her 20s
[1:26:46] before she would be able to develop
[1:26:49] sentences and develop words and and uh
[1:26:53] brother Tim he had prayed for her and
[1:26:56] and he one time in a call he told me he
[1:26:58] said put your tongue put your finger on
[1:27:00] her tongue and she hated that whatsoever
[1:27:05] and and so she came through the prayer
[1:27:08] line last year that this might be a
[1:27:10] courage to you she came through the
[1:27:12] prayer line with her mother last year
[1:27:14] and she left this
[1:27:16] meeting and when she left this meeting
[1:27:19] she be to develop words and then devel
[1:27:22] phrases and
[1:27:24] and they were we were told that she'd
[1:27:27] never be able to go to school and she's
[1:27:29] in her first year of school and doing
[1:27:31] really well
[1:27:41] and the other day I was uh I had her I
[1:27:45] was babysitting her and her brother
[1:27:47] Isaac both them are Supernatural babies
[1:27:49] and and so anyway
[1:27:51] there she was they had been in my office
[1:27:55] and I was studying for this meeting and
[1:27:57] they had toys all over the floor and uh
[1:28:00] that's the greatest trophies that I have
[1:28:02] as them playing there and so they had
[1:28:04] toys all over the floor and they had
[1:28:06] covered the floor and so I told them I
[1:28:08] said now it's time to clean
[1:28:10] up uh you can't put no more toys down
[1:28:12] there's not enough room and so that she
[1:28:14] they begin to clean up and I went into
[1:28:17] the I went into the uh kitchen and was
[1:28:19] getting a drink getting ready to go back
[1:28:21] to study and she came in and got herself
[1:28:23] up on the bar stool and was sitting
[1:28:26] across the bar like this and she said
[1:28:29] POA I I don't like to clean
[1:28:36] up I walked over and I put my arms down
[1:28:40] on the bar in front of her like this and
[1:28:42] I said you know I've got people at
[1:28:44] church that are just like you Zoe they
[1:28:48] don't like to clean up either
[1:28:55] you know our it's a great joy to enjoy
[1:28:58] serving the lord and one of the greatest
[1:29:01] joys of our life and forgive me for
[1:29:03] taking a minute but one of the greatest
[1:29:04] joys of our life it is this message
[1:29:09] works and it's not just good for you but
[1:29:12] it's good for your marriage and and it's
[1:29:15] good to raise your children in and you
[1:29:18] watch your grandchildren grow up in an
[1:29:20] environment to where that there's love
[1:29:23] and peace they don't know what a fight
[1:29:25] is all about and and they don't know
[1:29:27] what all the world's anxiety is and all
[1:29:30] the nonsense of the world and and you
[1:29:32] know they begin to grow up in this and
[1:29:34] they know what prayer meetings are and
[1:29:36] they know what singing and and they know
[1:29:38] how to come to church and get ready and
[1:29:41] they're ready for what God has for them
[1:29:43] and I I'd like to say this to you it
[1:29:48] works it absolutely works tonight I
[1:29:52] would like to to take a thought
[1:29:55] on

[1:31:05] on and God threw it back and said wipe
[1:31:08] your face
[1:31:10] off there's more work to
[1:31:22] do statement says courage is not having
[1:31:25] the strength to go on it's going on when
[1:31:28] you don't have any
[1:31:30] strength I want you to understand
[1:31:33] tonight that we must fight for
[1:31:37] life I don't know if you get it or not
[1:31:40] but we're at the end of the battle and
[1:31:41] we're living in total darkness according
[1:31:44] to the world and according to the
[1:31:46] message but we're living in a spot to
[1:31:48] where there's Total light but you got to
[1:31:51] fight for life

[1:33:14] Rapture he knows that once the Rapture
[1:33:17] happens you you're not no more in his
[1:33:20] crosshairs but while you're in his
[1:33:22] crosshairs he's doing everything that he
[1:33:25] can to kill to steal and to
[1:33:29] destroy and whether you realize it or

[1:42:01] the
[1:42:04] pressure and being with your grandfather
[1:42:07] was contemplated going there and stay
[1:42:11] it even to the point till God had to
[1:42:14] have a conference with
[1:42:16] him and on his trip back home he had to
[1:42:19] talk to him and and tell him and even
[1:42:23] show him a man depleted in his body to
[1:42:27] where that you know he looks so old and
[1:42:30] and even remind him if you carry out

[1:54:41] you God has dispatched angels to watch
[1:54:44] over

[1:55:18] pitch it with
[1:55:20] tar and they place that baby baby in a
[1:55:22] crocodile infested
[1:55:25] water and God dispatches angels 10,000
[1:55:30] of them to line up and down the mile and
[1:55:33] then he says DAV you get on you get on
[1:55:36] this
[1:55:38] basket and as he goes down through there
[1:55:40] and the crocodiles come up against him
[1:55:42] you take your foot and push him back
[1:55:44] down and when he gets in Whirl poles you
[1:55:47] get him out of those whirl Poes of
[1:55:49] life God is no respector Purp
[1:55:54] and when you get in trouble whether you

[1:56:30] on the wall that has always struck
[1:56:33] me and it said
[1:56:37] this it's not the size of the dog in the
[1:56:44] fight it's the size of the
[1:56:48] fight that's in the dog

[1:56:56] a big dog and you're just a coward
[1:56:58] you'll get whipped
[1:56:59] anyway but if you're a little puppy and
[1:57:01] you got a lot of
[1:57:03] grit you could put the enemy running
[1:57:06] anytime it's a size of God the god of
[1:57:10] Heaven that's in the heart and he's a
[1:57:13] big God

[2:12:20] weakest one here I got a quote for

[2:12:44] most gladly therefore will I rather
[2:12:45] glory and mind and firmness that the
[2:12:47] power of Christ May rest upon me Isaiah
[2:12:50] chapter 40 and verse 29 he giveth power
[2:12:53] to the
[2:12:56] faint and to them that have no might he
[2:12:59] increases
[2:13:01] strength this is your
[2:13:05] shot all
[2:13:07] right he giveth power to
[2:13:11] you he giveth you the strength and to
[2:13:14] you that have no
[2:13:16] might he increaseth your strength
[2:13:21] [Applause]
[2:13:30] stupid
[2:13:34] devil but they that wait upon the
[2:13:37] Lord shall renew their strength yeah
[2:13:40] they shall Mount up on wings like an
[2:13:42] eagle that's they shall
[2:13:46] run and not be weary they shall walk
[2:13:52] and not
[2:13:55] faint don't forget to walk don't forget
[2:13:59] to run and definitely don't get forget
[2:14:02] to
[2:14:06] fly they say that there is only a couple
[2:14:10] of birds that picks on
[2:14:16] Eagles and these birds will come and
[2:14:18] land on their backs and peck on their
[2:14:22] head now an eagle can either take
[2:14:25] it or fly into the
[2:14:29] heavens because those birds are not
[2:14:33] built to fly where like an eagle can
[2:14:38] fly that's the reason we come to church
[2:14:40] and you feel that little gritty Spirit
[2:14:42] trying to get around you just start
[2:14:44] [Applause]
[2:14:46] flying just start setting your wings a
[2:14:49] little bit just start lifting up into a
[2:14:52] Heavenly
[2:14:53] [Applause]
[2:14:58] atmosphere when I fall he lifts me
[2:15:01] up when I fail he forgives me when I am
[2:15:05] weak he is strong when I am lost he is
[2:15:08] my way when I'm afraid he's a he's my
[2:15:12] courage when I Stumble he steadies me
[2:15:15] when I hurt he heals me when I am broken
[2:15:18] he mends me when I am blind he leads me
[2:15:22] when I'm hungry he feeds me when I face
[2:15:24] trials he is with me when I face
[2:15:27] persecution he Shields me when I face
[2:15:29] problems he comforts me when I face loss
[2:15:32] he provides for me when I face death he
[2:15:34] carries me home he is my
[2:15:37] [Applause]
[2:15:45] god brother Brandon was standing one
[2:15:48] time
[2:15:49] and there was a a dead little boy on the
[2:15:53] side of the
[2:15:57] road he was
[2:16:00] mangled by a car run over him by a
[2:16:08] bicycle it was a horrible scene but
[2:16:12] brother brandom had seen this scene
[2:16:16] before he'd seen
[2:16:18] it and he tried to walk away a couple of
[2:16:22] times and the Lord would turn him
[2:16:25] around and he you know he he knew
[2:16:28] something was recognizable about the
[2:16:33] situation and he asked them said has he
[2:16:35] been in the meetings has he been in the
[2:16:38] prayer
[2:16:40] line no
[2:16:43] no says there's just something about it

[2:16:56] him
[2:16:59] before and he's seen
