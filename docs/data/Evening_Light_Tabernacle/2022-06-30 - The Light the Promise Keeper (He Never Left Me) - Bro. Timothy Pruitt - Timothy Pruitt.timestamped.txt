[44:21] amen is

[44:25] your notes
[44:27] amen so
[44:28] what do you do
[44:30] you find the scripture
[44:32] amen
[44:37] i want to just key in on that song he
[44:39] never left me
[44:41] i mean thankful he never left you
[44:44] he could have walked away
[44:46] but he never left you
[44:50] i just believe it's just the lord
[44:51] tonight
[44:52] amen be strong
[44:55] and courageous
[44:57] be not afraid
[44:58] or terrified because of them
[45:01] for the lord your god
[45:05] goes with you
[45:08] he will never leave you
[45:11] or forsake you
[45:14] amen you can be seated
[45:25] he's never left me
[45:29] he's never left you he's always been
[45:31] there with you
[45:33] every step of the way you know god asks
[45:36] for confidence in him to trust him and
[45:39] it's easy to trust him when you're going
[45:41] through on top of the mountain and
[45:43] you're having a wonderful day and
[45:44] everything's been going very good and
[45:46] all's rosy and singing the songs and
[45:49] shouting the victories but he also wants
[45:51] you to trust him when you're going
[45:53] through your darkest valleys
[45:55] truly that's where trust is really built
[45:58] is when you don't feel him you don't
[46:00] know he's there you maybe can't see see
[46:02] him anywhere around you but you know
[46:04] he's there how do you know he's there
[46:06] because his word says he's there
[46:09] and you know it's very it's very
[46:10] important to believe in him especially
[46:12] in the day we an hour that we live in
[46:15] you know and so to do that you got to
[46:17] understand who you are and also
[46:20] understand who he is
[46:22] because he will not let his word go
[46:24] unfulfilled he will fulfill it he will
[46:26] promise it he promised to keep it and
[46:28] that was going to be my title tonight
[46:30] the promise keeper but he promises that
[46:32] he will keep his word he will not let
[46:35] one jot or one tittle go unfulfilled in
[46:38] other words he will not even let a dot
[46:40] that goes over an eye be unfulfilled but
[46:43] even the smallest portion of his word
[46:46] god is concerned about and i'm thinking
[46:48] about that tonight because if you feel
[46:50] to be the least in the kingdom of god
[46:52] then you also have this confidence that
[46:55] god is concerned about you god knows
[46:57] about you he knows your needs he knows
[46:59] your struggles he knows exactly what
[47:02] you're going through and he knows on a
[47:03] wednesday night that you're down in the
[47:05] valley but he wants to come and tell you
[47:07] again he's never left you but he's
[47:09] walking with you and he's leading you
[47:11] and he's guiding you know i know right
[47:13] now that we're living in a very dark
[47:15] time and it seems impossible and
[47:17] possible situations are going on around
[47:19] us just hearing of all the deaths that
[47:21] are taking place just brother brother
[47:23] erickson's church was seemingly facing
[47:25] death after death four in the last few
[47:28] weeks and and brother david kegley had
[47:30] told me about his dad and that was mom
[47:32] he found her on the floor and it seems
[47:34] like in those moments that you're all
[47:36] alone it seems like that's the darkest
[47:38] times and it's around you and there's no
[47:40] help for you there's no no no nothing
[47:42] that can go on maybe you've done
[47:44] something wrong but you have not done
[47:46] something wrong god is wanting to show
[47:48] you that in your darkest moments he
[47:50] won't leave you amen he's allowing the
[47:53] bride of christ to come to the darkest
[47:55] time that there's ever been amen even
[47:58] even the dark ages was dark but it's not
[48:00] been as dark as it is now to where
[48:02] there's not even hardly a hope or or a
[48:04] glimpse of of righteousness or or a
[48:07] glimpse of holiness anymore so dark
[48:10] around us and so he would allow it to be
[48:12] in this valley that he could prove his
[48:14] word over and over again i'll never
[48:17] leave you but i'll be with you amen and
[48:20] he would build a society you know the
[48:22] society would live in amen the bar is
[48:24] set on how much you can earn or how much
[48:26] you can accumulate and your
[48:28] accomplishments and what you do and you
[48:31] they're lauded you know above everything
[48:33] about what you've done and how you've
[48:35] done it it's put above amen even the
[48:37] god-ordained purposes in our lives very
[48:40] often people have a hard time taking god
[48:43] at his word and if god's but if god says
[48:45] it that settles it if god says it it
[48:48] doesn't there's no need to ever doubt it
[48:51] because he will bring it to pass amen so
[48:54] we read here he promised them that
[48:56] they're going to go into this place and
[48:57] it's going to be battles they're going
[48:59] to go in there there's going to be high
[49:00] walls they're going to go in there
[49:02] there's going to be giants they're going
[49:03] to go in there and there's going to be
[49:05] impossible situations there's going to
[49:07] be high mountains with giants that have
[49:09] lived there for years and years and
[49:11] they've been happy living in that land
[49:13] but you have been commissioned to go in
[49:15] there and cast them out and you're not
[49:18] going alone but i'm going to go with you
[49:20] and i'm going to be with you in a trial
[49:22] i'm going to be with you in the fire i'm
[49:24] going to be with you in your trouble i'm
[49:26] going to be with you when you face that
[49:28] giant of cancer
[49:30] was he not with you sister atlanta hey
[49:32] remember that giant would step out with
[49:34] those priestly robes and try to scare
[49:36] the liver out of you but he couldn't
[49:38] scheme i could scare you but he could
[49:40] not scare the god that was in you but
[49:42] the god that was in you would rise up
[49:44] and begin to pulsate in your life until
[49:47] you can call i mean come with assurance
[49:50] that god is with me i might have cancer
[49:53] god is with me i might have every kind
[49:55] of sickness god is with me i might not
[49:58] have a dollar in my account but god is
[50:00] with me i'm not looking at me looking at
[50:02] an impossible situation but god is with
[50:05] me
[50:07] walls may be thick all around me and it
[50:09] seems impossible but god is with me
[50:12] [Applause]
[50:13] hallelujah you might be one of those
[50:15] seeds like rahab that was calling that
[50:18] wall and there seemed to be no self for
[50:20] her and there seemed to be no hope for
[50:22] her her life was wrecked and her life
[50:24] was shot and it was no hope for her but
[50:27] one day a messenger came to her and
[50:29] began to tell her the good news
[50:31] amen it wasn't just a god of history but
[50:34] it's a god of today and he gave her a
[50:36] token a covenant and said if you put it
[50:38] in your door you and your family will be
[50:41] saved
[50:43] amen it gives me courage to know that
[50:45] even rahab god didn't leave her god
[50:47] didn't forsake her it was only one or
[50:50] maybe maybe two or maybe three but god i
[50:53] tear the walls down to go get his
[50:56] children that gives me so much
[50:57] confidence in the hour that we're living
[50:59] in we know of some ray halves we know of
[51:02] some people that have sold their
[51:03] birthright but they ain't enough big
[51:05] enough walls that god won't knock it
[51:08] down and go to where they are
[51:10] and prove again over and over i never
[51:14] left you
[51:17] to my tonight they might be saying god's
[51:19] left me he's a million miles away i
[51:22] ain't felt them in years but i'm here to
[51:24] tell you once again god's never left you
[51:27] [Applause]
[51:32] but in this time we have a hard time
[51:34] taking god at his word you know why
[51:36] because we're relying so much on this
[51:38] right here
[51:39] or this right here in our minds and it's
[51:42] the world has been built to where the
[51:44] standards are are are the earthly
[51:47] accomplishments and the worldly
[51:49] standards and all these things are
[51:51] placed above amen the call of god
[51:54] you know because he would say it again
[51:56] in hebrews 13 5. he says keep your lives
[51:59] free from the love of money
[52:02] oh yeah
[52:04] and be content with what you have
[52:07] because god has said
[52:11] amen why does he want you to get away
[52:13] and not be have a love of money because
[52:16] if you have a love of money then money
[52:17] is your god
[52:19] and money becomes your everything
[52:21] therefore it doesn't hurt to miss what
[52:23] miss church on sunday because you got a
[52:25] greater god
[52:28] come on now hey man you got someone some
[52:30] money in the bank and you got confidence
[52:32] in in something more than but listen god
[52:35] does not want you to have confidence in
[52:37] something that's temporary
[52:41] because we know goodwill the money that
[52:43] we have today is temporary
[52:45] you can have it stacked up to the
[52:47] ceiling in every room in your house and
[52:49] he'd never sock in your drawer but it's
[52:51] temporary
[52:54] amen one day maybe i won't even be able
[52:55] to buy anything amen money can become
[52:58] worthless overnight
[53:01] but people get so involved and chasing
[53:03] after it and that's their god and
[53:05] they'll destroy friendships over money
[53:10] amen
[53:11] amen over money they'll destroy
[53:13] friendships and then they'll have it to
[53:15] in their heart but why because they love
[53:17] it so much because it's their god but he
[53:20] said don't do that because i have said i
[53:23] will never leave you
[53:25] when money leaves you i'll still be
[53:27] there
[53:28] hallelujah when troubles come i'll still
[53:30] be there listen you serve a god amen
[53:33] that can get you out of a trouble that
[53:35] money can't get you out of
[53:41] listen well steve jobs was talking about
[53:43] the other night he had that uh pancreas
[53:46] cancer
[53:47] listen if there had been a cure
[53:49] he had enough money to buy it
[53:53] but money couldn't get him there
[53:55] amen no doubt he spent a lot of his
[53:57] wealth searching after it and wanting it
[53:59] and desiring it wanting to live wanting
[54:01] to go a little further wanting to be a
[54:03] little more i wanted to go another month
[54:04] another day whatever another hour
[54:06] whatever money was worthless to him in
[54:08] those moments amen but see this god can
[54:12] get you out of trouble amen where money
[54:15] can't get you out
[54:17] it'll get you healing when money can't
[54:19] get you healing
[54:21] amen this god will get you joy when
[54:23] money can't get you joy it'll get you
[54:26] happiness when happy that when when this
[54:28] world can't get you that
[54:31] hallelujah amen this god he promised us
[54:34] he promises no matter how long we go we
[54:37] may go 10 more years five more years i
[54:39] don't know how far we're going and it's
[54:41] going to get harder and it's going to
[54:43] get harder and it's going to get harder
[54:45] but his word will remain the same
[54:48] he will never leave you he'll be with
[54:51] you he'll guide you he'll hold you he'll
[54:55] keep you
[55:05] deuteronomy
[55:07] 31 6 was written to encourage the
[55:09] children of israel as they're getting
[55:11] ready to go across
[55:13] into some great battles
[55:16] into some great wars
[55:18] and some really hardships
[55:20] some big trials
[55:23] through some difficult times
[55:26] through loss of loved ones
[55:29] amen through tragic tragedies and and
[55:32] through
[55:33] killings and all kinds of things
[55:36] and he was trying to show them right at
[55:37] the beginning you're going to go through
[55:39] some things but i'm going to be with you
[55:42] you're going to go through things but
[55:43] i'm going to be there
[55:45] you're going to go through a valley but
[55:47] i'm going to be there amen you're going
[55:49] to go have you're going to have problems
[55:51] and situations you know he would also
[55:53] tell it he would tell it to joshua amen
[55:55] in joshua 10 and verse
[55:57] let me go let me go down and see we go
[56:00] it would go to tell him to joshua
[56:01] because joshua would begin to fight
[56:04] and joshua would go and he would come
[56:07] against five kings and he would come
[56:08] against
[56:09] all the walls and he would come against
[56:11] ai and he he would face defeated ai but
[56:14] he knew when he faced defeated ai
[56:17] something was wrong because god promised
[56:19] him i'll be with you
[56:26] he went through all kinds of things
[56:29] he told it to solomon
[56:32] he told it to solomon
[56:36] in first chronicles 22 and verse 13 says
[56:38] you will have success
[56:40] if you are careful to observe the
[56:43] decrees and laws that the lord gave
[56:45] moses
[56:47] be strong and courageous
[56:50] do not be afraid or discouraged
[56:56] david would say it again in 28 20 said
[56:58] be strong and courageous do the work
[57:01] or play the man do not be afraid or
[57:03] discouraged for the lord god my god
[57:07] is with you
[57:09] he will not fail you or forsake you
[57:12] until all the work for the service of
[57:14] the temple of the lord is finished
[57:19] hallelujah we can take that scripture
[57:20] for us tonight because there's a
[57:22] building that's taking place right now
[57:24] it's the building of the body of christ
[57:26] and his word will remain to say all the
[57:29] way to the last support the last stone
[57:32] is put in position
[57:34] to the last part is there whatever it is
[57:37] if it's a stone if it's a piece of
[57:38] timber whatever it is it's going to hold
[57:40] there and it's going to remain i will
[57:43] not forsake my bride
[57:46] i'll be with her when she needs healing
[57:48] i'll be with her when she needs
[57:49] deliverance i'll be with her when she
[57:51] needs comfort
[57:53] i am the comforter
[58:05] the old testament is full of
[58:07] insurmountable
[58:08] challenges
[58:11] but god wanted them to know
[58:13] that no matter how big the challenge
[58:16] you could
[58:17] trust him for complete victory
[58:25] it was a call
[58:29] for trust
[58:31] and i feel like we're hearing that same
[58:33] call
[58:35] we're going through some really
[58:37] tough times economically things are
[58:39] happening situations we don't know what
[58:41] tomorrow holds
[58:47] he would tell it again to hezekiah
[58:50] and ii chronicles 32 said be strong and
[58:53] courageous
[58:55] do not be afraid or discouraged because
[58:58] of the king of assyria and the vast army
[59:02] with him
[59:04] for there is a greater power with you
[59:08] than there is with him
[59:12] if you can understand that tonight boy
[59:14] you would go out here shouting a victory
[59:17] because no matter what you're facing it
[59:19] may seem to be an insurmountable odd but
[59:22] there's a greater power with you
[59:29] amen sister sister ruth you have been
[59:31] facing a very dark trial but there's a
[59:34] greater power with you
[59:38] amen you may be facing something in your
[59:41] family and you don't know the answer to
[59:43] but there's a greater power with you
[59:46] than all that surrounds you and all the
[59:49] problems around you and everything
[59:51] around you
[59:53] even if that enemy begins to begin to
[59:56] say and mock you and make fun of you and
[59:58] say see i told you he's just the god of
[1:00:00] the hills and he's not the god of the
[1:00:02] valleys
[1:00:03] i told you he's only god when you're
[1:00:05] singing the praises and you're up on top
[1:00:08] of the mountain and you got up this
[1:00:09] morning and nothing went wrong and you
[1:00:11] checked your bank account and it slammed
[1:00:13] full
[1:00:16] amen you got it overflowing coming out
[1:00:18] your ears money in the bank and no jobs
[1:00:21] lined up for days oh it's so wonderful i
[1:00:23] told you he's god there but now you're
[1:00:25] in the valley now you're in a dark time
[1:00:28] now you're going through a trouble now
[1:00:30] deaths have hit the church now problems
[1:00:32] is all around you see i told you he's
[1:00:34] only a god at youth camp he's only a god
[1:00:37] at meetings he's only a guard at special
[1:00:40] services but on a wednesday night i told
[1:00:42] you you're going to go there and you're
[1:00:44] not going to get nothing because you're
[1:00:45] in a valley
[1:00:47] but the lord heard your enemy tonight
[1:00:53] he said you tell their enemy i'm not
[1:00:56] just the god of the mountain
[1:00:58] i'm also the god in the valley
[1:01:03] hallelujah i'm not just a god when
[1:01:07] you're singing my praises i'm still god
[1:01:10] when you can't say a word
[1:01:13] i'm still a god when you're all down and
[1:01:15] you're all depressed and you don't know
[1:01:17] which return i'm still god
[1:01:27] i'm not just god when your family's
[1:01:30] sitting on the front row and they're all
[1:01:32] serving god but i'm still god when one's
[1:01:35] in a bar room one's lost over here one's
[1:01:37] lost over there i have not forgot them
[1:01:40] but i am a god in your valley
[1:01:52] be strong
[1:01:53] and courageous
[1:02:07] i'm not just a god when you've been
[1:02:09] dancing around in youth camp and you
[1:02:11] guessed the victory over that devil and
[1:02:13] you he lost his victory over you but i'm
[1:02:16] also the god when you're going through
[1:02:18] your hallways at school or you're riding
[1:02:20] by yourself in the car or you don't know
[1:02:22] where your next job's coming from i'm
[1:02:25] still the same yesterday today and
[1:02:28] forever i will not chase i have no
[1:02:31] chance
[1:02:40] i was gone on this sunday morning when a
[1:02:42] little friend woman got out of that pew
[1:02:45] and she ran around that building and she
[1:02:47] gave god praise leaning on me
[1:02:49] everlasting odds but tonight
[1:02:52] in your valley i'm still a god you can
[1:02:55] lean on i'm still a god you can trust
[1:02:58] i'm still a god it's a victory it's
[1:03:00] tonight for you
[1:03:06] you don't have to be afraid
[1:03:08] you don't have to be discouraged
[1:03:12] god's promises
[1:03:14] are always or never
[1:03:17] [Applause]
[1:03:21] therefore he can be fully trusted
[1:03:28] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:03:31] the bible says god is not human
[1:03:34] that he should lie
[1:03:36] he's not a human being that he should
[1:03:38] change his mind
[1:03:40] does he speak
[1:03:41] and then does he not act does he promise
[1:03:45] and not fulfill
[1:03:49] you know i need some answers to that
[1:03:50] tonight
[1:03:52] god is not human
[1:03:53] that he should lie
[1:03:58] we had a human being he full of lies
[1:04:03] can't hold some some of them can't even
[1:04:04] hardly tell the truth
[1:04:06] because the truth ain't in them
[1:04:12] a human will lie to you tell you you're
[1:04:15] his best friend the next day hate you
[1:04:17] like you was a murderer
[1:04:22] sad to say that's even in church
[1:04:27] but we got
[1:04:28] but god's not a human
[1:04:31] thank you god
[1:04:33] he became human but he's not a human
[1:04:36] therefore god don't change his mind
[1:04:39] thank you god
[1:04:40] so therefore if god chose you before the
[1:04:42] foundation of the world he cannot
[1:04:45] unchoose you
[1:04:47] [Applause]
[1:04:48] even though you tried to walk away
[1:04:51] even though you took the wrong road even
[1:04:54] though tonight you might be on the wrong
[1:04:56] road he can't un-choose you
[1:05:03] even though you're going the wrong
[1:05:05] direction
[1:05:08] even though you've posted stupid stuff
[1:05:11] on facebook
[1:05:13] we're gonna get it where we live at
[1:05:17] even though you've done all kinds of
[1:05:20] things he can't unchoose you
[1:05:27] know to give some shouting shoes to
[1:05:28] somebody tonight
[1:05:30] god cannot unchoose you
[1:05:33] he cannot say you're my child one day
[1:05:35] and the next day or the next hour or the
[1:05:37] next minute or the next second say
[1:05:39] you're not my child but if he chose you
[1:05:41] before the foundation of the world
[1:05:43] [Applause]
[1:05:45] you will be chose until there's no more
[1:05:49] until we step into eternity
[1:05:52] and all through eternity
[1:05:55] god cannot unchoose you he cannot change
[1:05:59] his mind therefore when you go down the
[1:06:01] wrong road he's not going to turn and
[1:06:03] walk away
[1:06:06] oh my god
[1:06:08] how many times have you realized in your
[1:06:10] life you were walking down the wrong way
[1:06:13] but somehow he still touched you
[1:06:18] that's because he didn't turn around and
[1:06:20] walk the other way and say i give up on
[1:06:22] him i'm tired of him i don't want him no
[1:06:25] more i hear i've told him i tried i've
[1:06:27] done everything but i give up on him i'm
[1:06:29] walking away he's like no he sees you
[1:06:32] walking away and he just still follows
[1:06:34] you
[1:06:35] he's still walking with you he's still
[1:06:38] talking to you he's still guiding you no
[1:06:40] don't get that far over there come on
[1:06:42] back over here
[1:06:44] not not that far get back over here
[1:06:46] and you keep feeling these you think
[1:06:48] it's rather just me it's just my who i
[1:06:50] am no god is still choosing you
[1:06:53] there he cannot say i don't want him no
[1:06:56] more
[1:07:06] yeah y'all don't understand
[1:07:08] i have tried
[1:07:10] all day long
[1:07:12] i have tried
[1:07:13] all week long i've tried in the last few
[1:07:16] days to get something to preach tonight
[1:07:18] and i thought i had it and my ipad said
[1:07:20] nope

[1:07:27] all i know is it deleted it
[1:07:29] and i was back there
[1:07:32] what am i going to do
[1:07:34] what am i going to do
[1:07:35] and these words been rolling through my
[1:07:37] head all day
[1:07:38] he never left me
[1:07:43] can i be real honest with you
[1:07:46] just this week driving down the road i
[1:07:48] said lord i'm ready to give up
[1:07:54] i'm done
[1:07:57] he never left me
[1:08:01] he was still there
[1:08:02] he was still there all the time
[1:08:07] he's still moving
[1:08:08] still coming on the scene still
[1:08:10] operating still touching still directing
[1:08:13] still doing things when you've given up
[1:08:19] you probably gave up this week yourself
[1:08:21] and though i'll never go back to the
[1:08:23] service but he was still directing
[1:08:25] he was still nudging and he was still
[1:08:26] pushing and here you are tonight
[1:08:32] i think about it i i i listen i heard
[1:08:34] that song so many years ago and it
[1:08:36] touched me i sent it to brother phillip
[1:08:37] he never sang it but i guess god was
[1:08:39] saving it for tonight
[1:08:41] so i sent it to him today i said look
[1:08:43] man you got sing this song i've been
[1:08:45] listening to it over and over and over
[1:08:47] and i i i just need to hear it and i
[1:08:50] believe you're the man for it
[1:08:52] because i remember a time in his life he
[1:08:55] went the wrong way
[1:08:56] he'd went down the wrong path he'd went
[1:08:59] down the wrong place but god never left
[1:09:02] him
[1:09:04] he might have thought he had he might
[1:09:06] have given up on him he said i'll never
[1:09:07] go back but god was still nudging god
[1:09:10] was still pushing god was still coming
[1:09:12] god was still every angle god was
[1:09:14] directing god was orchestrating that
[1:09:17] life until one night on a wednesday
[1:09:19] night he was sitting there and he looked
[1:09:21] at his families they're about to walk
[1:09:22] out the door and he said if you'll wait
[1:09:24] for me i'll go with you
[1:09:26] [Applause]
[1:09:28] what was it god never left him he may
[1:09:31] have left god but god didn't leave him
[1:09:36] every one of us can testify the same
[1:09:38] thing we all had moments in our life we
[1:09:41] pulled away but god didn't leave us god
[1:09:44] was right there for us
[1:09:51] he came to that church service on a
[1:09:53] wednesday night and guess who was
[1:09:54] preaching
[1:09:58] guess who was raised up with him all his
[1:10:00] life
[1:10:02] guess who fought with him in the
[1:10:04] backyard
[1:10:09] god's doing something nowadays man back
[1:10:11] in our dark days we had fights every
[1:10:13] service
[1:10:17] i ain't talking about just me and
[1:10:17] brother phillip i'm just talking about
[1:10:19] fights
[1:10:23] i'm thankful we ain't got some kind of
[1:10:24] kids no more
[1:10:36] he's sitting back there
[1:10:38] he's discouraged
[1:10:40] and he's aggravated
[1:10:42] he's like
[1:10:44] brother timothy's preaching
[1:10:46] why did i come
[1:10:48] can't they say anything i'm just trying
[1:10:50] to remember his own testimony i think i
[1:10:52] got it pretty close
[1:10:53] he said
[1:10:54] he said
[1:10:55] can't they say anything new anymore i've
[1:10:57] heard this before
[1:10:59] but see god was orchestrated
[1:11:02] god was moving because here i am i just
[1:11:04] went through a situation in my life
[1:11:07] and on a saturday morning i was studying
[1:11:10] again trying to come up with something
[1:11:11] like on a four sunday night communion
[1:11:13] service and i couldn't i had a thought
[1:11:15] on the god we could rely on but i
[1:11:16] couldn't i couldn't get it together i
[1:11:18] couldn't
[1:11:20] it wasn't nothing to delete
[1:11:28] so the kids went out to play some disc
[1:11:30] golf out the state park and i told ruth
[1:11:32] i said let's go get some hamburgers and
[1:11:34] some buns and let's go cook them
[1:11:35] barbecue out there and let's just get
[1:11:36] away from here i i ain't doing no good
[1:11:38] here anyway so we went out there
[1:11:40] and uh some of my youngest i think it
[1:11:42] was andrew and it was pretty young at
[1:11:45] that time
[1:11:46] and grabbed the rip sticks and throw
[1:11:47] them in the car and we get there
[1:11:49] do you realize what's going on the whole
[1:11:51] time god is nudging
[1:11:53] god is moving
[1:11:55] god because if i don't get there and go
[1:11:57] through this situation i'm not going to
[1:11:59] be preaching what i'm going to preach on
[1:12:01] wednesday night
[1:12:03] and it wasn't an easy situation it was a
[1:12:05] terrifying situation my little girl
[1:12:08] adriana goes down a hill the wrong way
[1:12:11] down the wrong path
[1:12:13] thinking she's trying to snowboard
[1:12:16] on asphalt
[1:12:18] and she don't make a curve and she goes
[1:12:20] down a parking lot ends up flying 30
[1:12:22] feet through the air smacks into a brick
[1:12:25] into a steel pole with her head
[1:12:27] and just goes flying dirt and stuff all
[1:12:29] over and i come down to her and she's
[1:12:32] out of it and she's just got this rattle
[1:12:34] in her throat and her eyes are rolled in
[1:12:36] the back of her head and i just ease her
[1:12:38] onto her back just make sure her airways
[1:12:39] are clear and i'm talking to her adriana
[1:12:41] talk to me baby talk to me talk to me
[1:12:43] talk to him and then she she go daddy i
[1:12:46] can't see
[1:12:48] and i look at her eyes across from
[1:12:50] hitting her head and her head's all
[1:12:51] swolled out and i said lord
[1:12:53] i'm here on this place not by
[1:12:55] happenstance i don't believe i said i'm
[1:12:57] just like that man that was with your
[1:12:58] prophet who got the bit on the foot with
[1:13:00] a snake
[1:13:02] so we're not out here doing anything
[1:13:03] wrong we're out here enjoying nature
[1:13:05] enjoying some time of fellowship i'm
[1:13:06] asking that the same god that took that
[1:13:09] poison out of that life will take the
[1:13:12] the hurt and the pain and the call all
[1:13:14] the things that it's causing away from
[1:13:16] my little girl in jesus name amen and i
[1:13:19] looked down and then my eyes uncrossed
[1:13:21] and she said daddy i can't see you and i
[1:13:23] bowed my head and i prayed again i said
[1:13:25] father she can't see you you uncrossed
[1:13:28] her eyes well you now give her a sight
[1:13:30] and she goes daddy i see you now
[1:13:34] but she couldn't remember nothing for 20
[1:13:36] minutes she couldn't remember what had
[1:13:37] happened and she's screaming why am i
[1:13:39] here what's up with this what's wrong
[1:13:40] with my feet do i still have feet
[1:13:47] she had been wearing flip-flops
[1:13:49] and they'd tore off some yards back and
[1:13:52] her feet was skinned up

[1:13:57] ambulance her mind starts sparking again
[1:14:01] and she remembers what she had done

[1:14:05] so we let her go sister ruth jumps in

[1:14:10] ladies were there and took some of our
[1:14:12] kids brother james sister jeannie sister
[1:14:14] jenny and then brother matthew was there

[1:14:18] and he told brother tim brother tim

[1:14:22] the phone and says hangs it up and says
[1:14:24] lord let there not be one broke bone

[1:14:31] messed up

[1:14:50] one sign of a concussion
[1:14:53] there's nothing there
[1:14:59] hallelujah well on the way to the
[1:15:00] hospital i was praising god for what i
[1:15:03] just saw i saw a little girl going down
[1:15:05] the wrong path and seemingly go down to
[1:15:08] our destruction and in a moment god turn
[1:15:11] it around and her come back to herself
[1:15:13] and i'm still got my hand in there and
[1:15:15] i'm praising god tears are coming down
[1:15:16] my eyes and all of a sudden i hear my
[1:15:18] voice speak and it says what you see in
[1:15:20] the natural you'll also see in the
[1:15:22] supernatural
[1:15:26] hallelujah that's sunday night i get up
[1:15:28] and i give the testimony she spent the
[1:15:30] night saturday night in the hospital
[1:15:32] they dismissed her right after the
[1:15:33] sunday service i brought her to church
[1:15:35] said that very next service and i'm
[1:15:37] giving thou i don't need notes
[1:15:40] i've witnessed a god i can rely on and i
[1:15:43] could say he never left me
[1:15:46] but he was right there on that shore
[1:15:48] with me as i was knelt over my daughter
[1:15:51] the angel of god was right there
[1:15:55] and not only was he there he was some
[1:15:57] miles over in athens louisiana had a
[1:16:00] little house where a man had went down a
[1:16:02] wrong path and he found himself in
[1:16:05] amnesia and he found himself lost
[1:16:09] but he found himself on a wednesday
[1:16:12] night in a church service and i'm
[1:16:14] speaking on spiritual amnesia
[1:16:18] spiritual identity crisis i'm speaking
[1:16:21] on that and i was saying she's saying
[1:16:23] well i've done heard all this and heard
[1:16:25] all this and i come down to the end of
[1:16:26] it and i talk about the french soldier
[1:16:28] who got off the got off the train and
[1:16:31] he's looking around he's seeing a few
[1:16:33] things familiar around there
[1:16:35] and the guard is watching him as he
[1:16:37] begins to walk and he walks over a
[1:16:38] little no he said what was it he said
[1:16:40] there was a little water tower there
[1:16:42] that got us attention
[1:16:46] and there happened to be the same thing
[1:16:48] that was going on at brother phillips a
[1:16:50] water tower outside of his house
[1:16:53] and god was getting his attention
[1:16:56] god was moving on him and here he
[1:16:59] thought god left me i left him a long
[1:17:01] time ago you may have left god but god
[1:17:04] never left you
[1:17:06] he's been walked with you every mile of
[1:17:08] the way he was with you in every
[1:17:10] conversation he was with you in every
[1:17:12] trial he was with you in every trouble
[1:17:18] and that night he found himself in an
[1:17:20] altar
[1:17:23] but the best thing is
[1:17:25] god never changed his mind about it
[1:17:30] ought to give hope to anyone tonight
[1:17:32] any prodigal
[1:17:34] doesn't matter if you've been gone five
[1:17:36] months five days or five years or 10
[1:17:38] years or 100 years it don't matter
[1:17:41] whatever you are tonight god has never
[1:17:44] left you
[1:17:47] he never left the prodigal son he was
[1:17:49] right there nudging him when he was even
[1:17:51] in the hog pit
[1:17:52] [Applause]
[1:17:53] what gave him the unction to come to
[1:17:55] himself and say hey there's better food
[1:17:57] in my father's house i'm going to go
[1:17:59] home
[1:18:01] and be a servant
[1:18:05] but the father
[1:18:06] hasn't changed his mind about him
[1:18:10] i'll tell you what if he ever comes back
[1:18:11] he's going to be a servant
[1:18:13] i'm going to put him he's going to wash
[1:18:14] the dishes and he's going to make up for
[1:18:16] all the amends and he's going to make up
[1:18:18] for this and he going i'll tell you what
[1:18:20] that low down sorry no good for nothing
[1:18:22] joker
[1:18:23] that wasn't a father's attitude
[1:18:29] i'll tell you what it done something to
[1:18:30] me the other night brother gabriel told
[1:18:32] that part about why the father ran
[1:18:36] because he had to get to him before the
[1:18:38] townspeople did
[1:18:41] i'm so glad he got to me
[1:18:43] before anyone else did
[1:18:46] that he threw that robe of adoption
[1:18:48] around me that robe of of a royalty
[1:18:51] around me his robe and said hey
[1:18:54] get the party started
[1:18:56] kill the fatted cast one that's been
[1:18:59] lost has come home again
[1:19:06] hallelujah listen if you're out there
[1:19:08] and you're wondering well people they're
[1:19:10] gonna think i'm crazy they're gonna call
[1:19:12] me a bunch of low down nothing for all i
[1:19:13] know we're not we're ready to put a robe
[1:19:16] around you we're ready to welcome you
[1:19:18] back to the father's house we're ready
[1:19:20] to say welcome home
[1:19:23] why can you say that because i'm saying
[1:19:26] what the father said
[1:19:36] it was a call
[1:19:38] to trust
[1:19:40] amid great adversity
[1:19:47] a few verses later he would say again
[1:19:49] the lord himself goes before you
[1:19:52] and be with you
[1:19:54] he will never leave you nor forsake you
[1:19:57] don't be afraid
[1:19:58] don't be discouraged
[1:20:02] when we promise
[1:20:03] we promise always or never
[1:20:07] most of the time we can't keep it
[1:20:10] things happen humanity humans
[1:20:13] something called being a human that's
[1:20:14] why the saiyan would say never say never
[1:20:20] because just as soon as you say never
[1:20:25] i'll never marry somebody younger than
[1:20:27] me
[1:20:31] i'll never never marry a bald-headed man
[1:20:37] these are some i've heard and it
[1:20:39] happened
[1:20:45] i'd never marry him anyone that's got
[1:20:47] ugly feet
[1:20:50] i ain't heard that one but just in case
[1:20:55] you never say never
[1:20:56] because you're human
[1:20:59] but god can say never and it be never.
[1:21:04] or he can say
[1:21:05] therefore he can say i will never
[1:21:08] forsake you
[1:21:10] and he don't kind of come back and say
[1:21:12] well i shouldn't have said never
[1:21:14] man what was i thinking
[1:21:18] i messed up big time
[1:21:20] no god doesn't matt it doesn't matter
[1:21:22] where you go
[1:21:23] his word remains the same
[1:21:26] if you're his child it will never
[1:21:29] forsake you
[1:21:31] you can say well i'm just going to go
[1:21:33] out and i'm going to make my own life
[1:21:34] and i'm going to be my own person and
[1:21:36] but if you're a child of god
[1:21:38] you're going to be one of the most
[1:21:39] miserable people on the face of the
[1:21:41] earth because this word will never leave
[1:21:44] you
[1:21:45] you go to drink something it'll be in
[1:21:47] your ear you go to smoke something it'll
[1:21:50] be in your ear you're going to cut your
[1:21:51] hair off it'll be in your ear
[1:21:56] it will never
[1:21:57] leave you
[1:22:02] god's promises are always and never
[1:22:05] therefore he can be fully trusted
[1:22:07] to honor his word
[1:22:11] he can be fully trusted he would say it
[1:22:13] even to
[1:22:14] abraham he said behold i'm with you
[1:22:16] and will keep you wherever you go
[1:22:19] and bring you back to this land and i
[1:22:21] will never leave you until i've done
[1:22:24] what i've promised to you
[1:22:30] god stands with his word
[1:22:33] therefore he stands with his children
[1:22:37] therefore you can go through the
[1:22:38] roughest waters of your life
[1:22:41] he'll be there
[1:22:42] you can go through cancer he'll be there
[1:22:45] you can go through troubles of life that
[1:22:47] it seems like there ain't no way this is
[1:22:50] gonna ever work out that ain't what god
[1:22:53] says god says there is a way
[1:22:57] i am the way
[1:22:58] i will make a way where there seems to
[1:23:00] be no way
[1:23:01] therefore he's the waymaker he's a
[1:23:04] miracle worker he's a promise keeper and
[1:23:07] even when you don't see him working
[1:23:10] i wonder this move this even in this
[1:23:12] week or maybe this month you said lord i
[1:23:15] don't see you working
[1:23:17] i mean he said that lord i i just don't
[1:23:19] see you working even when you don't see
[1:23:22] me
[1:23:23] i'm working
[1:23:27] even when you don't feel me i'm working
[1:23:31] i'm thankful for that because we don't
[1:23:33] always feel him
[1:23:35] [Applause]
[1:23:36] listen you're not you're we're we're not
[1:23:39] in a place to where we always feel him
[1:23:44] you're not always in a an electric
[1:23:46] service or in a church service period
[1:23:52] you're at work
[1:23:53] you go through trials
[1:23:55] go through troubles you go through
[1:23:56] tribulations you go through deaths
[1:24:02] you don't feel him
[1:24:05] maybe you ain't felt him in a week
[1:24:07] a month
[1:24:08] maybe a year
[1:24:11] but he's never left you
[1:24:15] really what you ought to do if you
[1:24:17] hadn't felt him
[1:24:19] is see where you're at
[1:24:23] because many times
[1:24:25] feelings are based on where you're at
[1:24:29] if you're walking through grass you can
[1:24:30] feel grass if it comes up to your ankles
[1:24:32] to your knees
[1:24:33] if you're walking in the heat you can
[1:24:35] feel the heat if you're walking in the
[1:24:37] cold you can feel it
[1:24:40] so feelings many times are based on
[1:24:42] where you're at
[1:24:43] so if you have yourself in a in a real
[1:24:45] dry time you need to start looking where
[1:24:48] am i
[1:24:50] am i in a desert
[1:24:52] and am i in a desert because i walked
[1:24:54] into a desert
[1:24:57] am i in a hard moment in my life because
[1:24:59] i walked there because i my footsteps
[1:25:03] led me there amen
[1:25:05] am i here where i'm at because
[1:25:07] of where i walk to
[1:25:10] then if you find that self
[1:25:12] in that place
[1:25:14] turn back and walk towards him
[1:25:19] get closer to him
[1:25:21] listen in these times of trials
[1:25:23] they ain't the one thing to do
[1:25:25] get closer to him that's why they come
[1:25:34] you can read the bible and have enough
[1:25:36] evidence of times when things were
[1:25:38] plentiful
[1:25:39] and things were good
[1:25:40] and things were just
[1:25:42] all so hunky-dory
[1:25:45] they started bowing after other idols
[1:25:48] they started going after other things
[1:25:50] what had god have to do he'd have to
[1:25:52] send plagues he'd had to send trials
[1:25:55] he'd have to send the armies and what
[1:25:57] would they do they would pull closer to
[1:25:59] him
[1:26:03] we're not going to go through the
[1:26:04] tribulation but that does not mean we're
[1:26:07] not going to go through trials
[1:26:09] that does not mean we're not going to
[1:26:11] have hardships of life and face deaths
[1:26:17] brother erickson's church is just phase
[1:26:18] four
[1:26:20] and just the last few moments
[1:26:28] i'm sure there's some soul searching
[1:26:29] going on
[1:26:33] i may not have all this testimony
[1:26:34] exactly right but the gist of it is this
[1:26:36] brother wayne was telling me
[1:26:38] so there was a
[1:26:40] family that had left the church previous
[1:26:43] in two days
[1:26:45] two days
[1:26:47] before that fire
[1:26:48] the boy in that family
[1:26:51] dreams of charlie and his wife in a fire
[1:26:55] and out of the fire charlie screams at
[1:26:58] him and says get yourself to that summer
[1:27:00] camp
[1:27:04] brother wayne said you talking about
[1:27:05] expectations
[1:27:09] if god would be merciful to some
[1:27:10] backslidden people
[1:27:12] to give them a dream
[1:27:14] that in the middle of a trial in the
[1:27:15] middle of a trouble middle of a
[1:27:18] house exploding and a voice of mercy
[1:27:21] could scream out and say get yourself to
[1:27:23] that camp
[1:27:28] he never left them
[1:27:32] he never left them
[1:27:34] he was there with them even in their
[1:27:36] backslidden conditions
[1:27:38] you may find yourself tonight in a
[1:27:40] backslidden condition but i'm here to
[1:27:42] tell you god has not left you
[1:27:48] but he's with you
[1:27:50] even in a fire
[1:27:52] i've said it
[1:27:54] reminded of it this week
[1:27:56] as i would say that to god
[1:27:59] god would say back to me
[1:28:02] have i left you
[1:28:05] i promised you i was with you in the
[1:28:07] fire
[1:28:09] i haven't left you
[1:28:11] so don't leave me
[1:28:16] that's why the scripture would hit me
[1:28:19] as i would read it at the beginning
[1:28:22] i'll never leave you
[1:28:26] go through trials of our life we go
[1:28:28] through situations
[1:28:30] and you want to just give up
[1:28:33] god hasn't left you
[1:28:36] so don't leave him
[1:28:40] let's power it
[1:28:55] i feel if you can just come sing that
[1:28:57] song again for me
[1:29:10] i wonder
[1:29:17] all this
[1:29:20] she would say just off the cuff
[1:29:24] unplanned unrehearsed
[1:29:26] [Music]
[1:29:32] god would just give a scripture
[1:29:38] [Music]
[1:29:44] maybe you find yourself in the desert
[1:29:48] [Music]
[1:29:50] maybe you find yourself in a trial
[1:29:53] maybe you find yourself backslidden away
[1:29:55] from him
[1:29:55] [Music]

[1:30:05] hands go up all over the building
[1:30:07] [Music]
[1:30:12] but i want to ask for more than that
[1:30:13] tonight
