[34:57] Lord and no matter where we have been

[35:05] sin mistakes the shame you've always
[35:08] been there Lord
[35:09] father you have watched over that seed
[35:13] he brought in a connection with this and
[35:15] then that one Lord to to bring it to
[35:17] this place that it set today Father
[35:20] [Music]
[35:21] and so father we're so thankful that
[35:23] you've been faithful
[35:25] faithful to your promise faithful to
[35:27] your word faithful to your children and
[35:30] we just invite you to come tonight
[35:32] God that you would be the guest speaker
[35:34] you would take these notes lower these
[35:36] stalks tonight that I have set aside and
[35:38] studied and Lord and you would just
[35:40] begin to project him but Lord not only
[35:43] protect him but may they hit their
[35:44] intended purpose their intended Mark
[35:46] tonight may you just give life to the
[35:48] word father now you're anoint our hearts
[35:50] that we can receive our ears to discern
[35:52] Lord the right spirit in which the word
[35:55] is coming forth and father I pray that
[35:57] you will just anoint my lips to bring
[35:59] forth your word Not My Thoughts not my
[36:02] Humanity not Lord our mistakes and our
[36:05] failures Lord and our complexes or any
[36:07] of those things Lord that we as humans
[36:09] deal with but God will stand by on this
[36:11] sacred desk tonight to project Christ to
[36:14] display Christ to give evidence to the
[36:16] life that you have projected in this
[36:18] hour Lord Lord you have a purpose father
[36:21] we want to declare that purpose tonight
[36:22] to your children we ask that you just
[36:24] have your way now Lord in Jesus name
[36:27] amen if you have your Bibles tonight
[36:28] [Music]
[36:30] we're going to look here in Genesis 1
[36:31] and verse 26.
[36:39] I'd like to speak to you again tonight
[36:41] on the word we'll bring forth after his
[36:43] kind
[36:44] this will be part five of that series
[36:46] but I also want to give it a subtitle
[36:48] tonight
[36:49] evidence of the original life
[36:53] so just trusted
[36:55] you come expecting tonight we just bring
[36:57] our greetings to you we look here and
[36:59] the Bible tells us and God said let us
[37:01] make man in our image after our likeness
[37:04] and let them have dominion over the fish
[37:06] of the sea and over the fowl of the air
[37:08] and over the cattle and over all the
[37:10] Earth and over every creeping thing that
[37:12] creepeth upon the Earth so God created
[37:15] man in his own image
[37:17] in the image of God created he him male
[37:20] and female created heed them God bless
[37:22] you you can have your seats tonight
[37:26] so we know from our previous studies
[37:28] that God had a purpose in the very
[37:30] beginning and that purpose was to have a
[37:33] family that purpose was to have a people
[37:35] that would be after his own kind or his
[37:37] own specie people after God's likeness
[37:40] and God was and God is determined to
[37:44] reproduce himself down through every age
[37:46] into the finality which is Us in this
[37:49] hour and we find her in Psalms 1 and
[37:51] verse 1 we're just going to pick up a
[37:53] few scripture readings this evening the
[37:55] Bible says blessed is the man that
[37:57] walketh not in the counsel of the
[37:59] ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[38:01] Sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the
[38:04] scornful but his Delight is in the law
[38:06] of the Lord and in the his law doeth he
[38:09] meditate day and night
[38:13] notice where this man is going to be
[38:15] planted the Bible says and he shall be
[38:17] like a tree that's planted by the rivers
[38:20] of water many rivers but one water one
[38:22] source so we find that bringeth forth
[38:24] his fruit in his season his leave also
[38:29] shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth
[38:31] shall prosper let's look also in Isaiah
[38:34] 43 and verse 5.
[38:37] if you can take some of the highs out
[38:39] and put me some bass in this would be
[38:41] great the Bible says fear not for I am
[38:44] with thee I will bring thy seed that
[38:46] word seed there is Offspring descendants
[38:49] children I will bring thy seed from the
[38:52] East and I will gather thee from the
[38:54] West I will say to the north give up and
[38:57] to the South keep not back bring my sons
[39:00] from afar and my daughters from the ends
[39:02] of the Earth even everyone that is
[39:04] called that word called there is chosen
[39:06] and notice we've read from our previous
[39:09] studies that we were chosen in him and
[39:12] he's telling us everyone that is chosen
[39:14] by my name for I have created him for my
[39:18] glory and I have formed him yea I have
[39:20] made him
[39:23] so we want to look again now we're
[39:24] looking tonight evidence of the original
[39:26] life and this word evidence means
[39:28] confirmation
[39:30] it means verification affirmation
[39:32] documentation declaration manifestation
[39:35] authentication and vindication
[39:38] so we're going to look at that as far as
[39:41] being applied to the original life in
[39:43] Isaiah 43 and verse 21 it says this
[39:45] people have I formed for myself and they
[39:49] shall show forth my praise
[39:52] so this now the people that God chose
[39:54] the people that God created the people
[39:56] that that God has determined they're
[39:57] going to bring forth notice they're not
[39:59] going to bring forth their own effort
[40:01] they're not going to bring forth of
[40:02] their own thinking but they're going to
[40:03] bring forth of my will of my word of my
[40:06] my likeness and everything that God has
[40:09] designed God has declared that he's
[40:11] going to bring forth his life his
[40:13] manifestation through his sonship and
[40:16] he's going to bring it all the way down
[40:17] through seven Church ages and we're
[40:19] going to be the final voice to the final
[40:21] age he's going to have the culmination
[40:23] and we are the culmination and what is
[40:26] God looking for he's looking for
[40:28] evidence of that original life evidence
[40:30] that was in the first seed that he
[40:33] planted and we notice in the end time
[40:35] that same life that was projected there
[40:37] in that seed is the same life that has
[40:40] to manifest in the end time in this seed
[40:44] see he's saying they're going to
[40:45] manifest his attributes and his desires
[40:48] through their lives they're going to
[40:50] bring praise to his name think about it
[40:53] all your failures all your mistakes
[40:55] through your life you're going to bring
[40:57] God praise
[40:58] when you overcome that test when you
[41:00] overcome that trial when you overcome
[41:03] that complex you're not bringing a
[41:05] victory to yourself though you are but
[41:07] yet you're bringing praise to the name
[41:09] of the Lord the one who's called you the
[41:12] one who's chosen you the one who put his
[41:14] own life inside of you what is that it's
[41:16] evidence that you have the Life of
[41:18] Christ
[41:19] [Applause]
[41:21] so let me just go on record to say
[41:22] tonight you're not an accident
[41:26] you're not a mistake
[41:29] God has watched over your seed
[41:33] he has put this one with this one two
[41:36] unlikely sources but brought them
[41:38] together and watched over that seed
[41:40] through Civil Wars through world wars
[41:42] through all kind of accidents and
[41:44] trouble and fire and God is watched over
[41:47] that sea to bring it right down to even
[41:50] like Tabernacle this evening God has
[41:53] watched over that sea you're not a
[41:55] mistake that you're here it's not a must
[41:57] take that that you're a believer of this
[41:59] message it's not a mistake that you're
[42:01] standing in this hour for this present
[42:03] truth you're not a mistake you're the
[42:05] predestinated seeds of God
[42:08] and wonder we're here to do in this hour
[42:10] is a show forth evidence of the original
[42:13] life
[42:16] so God has called you by name
[42:20] he's brought some of us from some of the
[42:21] most
[42:22] craziest places
[42:26] and I'm not talking about different
[42:27] states I'm talking about different
[42:29] places in life
[42:30] some of you are at the bottom of the
[42:32] bottom of the bottom and yet God has
[42:35] established you because he planted a
[42:37] seed inside of that vessel remember the
[42:40] prophet of God said it's not the person
[42:41] that comes predestinated it's the seed
[42:44] so we find so this message is more than
[42:47] just God's sin and the prophet
[42:50] it's more than us just following a bunch
[42:53] of ideas of a man
[42:54] come on church but no this message is to
[42:58] call it's God calling for the evidence
[43:00] God is calling for life to come out of
[43:03] that seed and to begin to manifest who
[43:06] he is
[43:07] that yet I will have a son I will have
[43:10] daughters of God they will be in my
[43:13] likeness they will be in my very image
[43:15] they will manifest the very life that I
[43:19] have
[43:21] so I will say tonight is a predestinated
[43:23] moment
[43:26] I would say it's not by accident that
[43:28] you are here
[43:29] you may just think well I'm just
[43:31] visiting an evening like Tabernacle no
[43:33] you're not visiting just visiting even
[43:35] like Tabernacle God is bringing
[43:37] everything together watching over those
[43:39] seeds
[43:40] and notice what he said in Isaiah 43 and
[43:42] verse 6 he says I will say to the north
[43:45] give up otherwise you can't retain you
[43:48] can't keep my children back you can't
[43:50] keep those seeds dormant any longer
[43:52] they're going to bring forth evidence of
[43:54] their original life Satan you have to
[43:56] take your hands off of God's promise
[43:59] he's going to say to the South keep not
[44:02] back let me tell you the time of Sons
[44:04] and Daughters of God are staying in the
[44:06] wings is over it's time for Sons to come
[44:09] forth It's time for daughters to comfort
[44:10] it's time for the elect to manifest
[44:13] Christ we can't just sit back in a
[44:15] closet and just say whatever we'll be
[44:17] will be it's time that we display the
[44:20] same signs the same wonders the same
[44:23] power the same Authority the same life
[44:27] and God is calling for it Satan take
[44:30] your hands off of my children it's time
[44:32] for them to come forth and bring forth
[44:34] of the same life
[44:38] see Satan Can't Hold Back God seed
[44:41] though he's tried
[44:43] so he's kept some of us in sin so he's
[44:47] kept you covered up and maybe failures
[44:49] and mistakes
[44:50] but when the season comes
[44:53] it's going to be like a tree that's been
[44:55] planted
[44:57] a tree that's been planted by the rivers
[45:00] of water
[45:01] and they're going to do what bring forth
[45:03] his fruit
[45:05] in his season
[45:07] so it's not our fruit
[45:10] it's not our Humanity it's not our or
[45:13] anything that we have to do with it but
[45:15] it's God's fruit and the prophet of God
[45:17] will take from this thought right here
[45:19] from Psalms 1 and verse 1 to verse 3 and
[45:23] he will preach the restoration of the
[45:24] Bride tree you realize that he had never
[45:27] made mention of the Bride tree up until
[45:30] 19 and and 1962 when he preached a
[45:33] restoration of the proprietary but he
[45:35] continued to reference this tree because
[45:38] this tree laid in this tree laid
[45:40] valuable valuable valuable valuable
[45:43] resources
[45:45] and he preached this tree all the way up
[45:47] until 1965 when he preached a Rapture
[45:50] message he was again referencing this
[45:53] broad tree and Satan has done everything
[45:55] that he can to cut this tree down to
[45:57] whack this tree down to keep this tree
[45:59] from produced but I'm here to tell you
[46:01] God has already sent a word out Church
[46:03] he's already sent a promise out you
[46:05] can't keep them back I already told you
[46:07] say take your hands off of those Sons
[46:10] and Daughters will come forth
[46:13] notice he was saying the restoration
[46:15] laboratory he shall bring forth his
[46:18] fruit in his season now watch each his
[46:21] he says the personal pronoun there it's
[46:24] his fruit God's fruit in the season
[46:28] that the prophet is bringing it now
[46:30] brother Timothy preached the message a
[46:32] while back on the season of the bringer
[46:34] so just hang tight because that's where
[46:36] we're headed see God's fruit In God's
[46:38] Time by The Prophet season he shall
[46:41] bring forth his fruit in his season if
[46:44] there isn't to his or he says bring
[46:46] forth his God's fruit see in the season
[46:49] that the messenger is ordained to come
[46:52] he will bring forth those now remember
[46:54] that the messenger that brings the fruit
[46:57] of God will bring it in God's season
[47:00] in the season of the bringer and some of
[47:04] you so stressed out about your love was
[47:05] so so worried about your prodigals but
[47:08] yet God is saying I will bring forth my
[47:10] fruit in my season in the season of the
[47:14] bringer you can't make them a son you
[47:16] can't make them serve God but in the
[47:18] season of the bringer he can't and I'm
[47:21] here to tell you I'm declaring to you
[47:22] tonight we are in the season we are in
[47:25] the season of healing when not even
[47:27] cancer can stand before the believer's
[47:29] prayer we're in the season of
[47:30] Deliverance we're in the season of
[47:32] tongues and interpretation wisdom and
[47:34] discernment we're in the season of the
[47:36] supernatural we are in the season of the
[47:38] bringer church and what is he bringing
[47:41] he's bringing sons of God Daughters of
[47:43] God he's bringing forth the original
[47:45] life
[47:46] [Applause]
[47:48] so we're we're not living in a day when
[47:51] the seed was planted
[47:53] but we're living in a day when the seed
[47:55] is to bring forth
[47:57] his fruit
[47:59] not your own human desires your human
[48:02] efforts but you're to bring forth his
[48:04] fruit
[48:05] what is his fruit these signs shall
[48:08] follow them that believe
[48:12] same signs same wonders same promise
[48:15] same God same power same Authority same
[48:18] manifestation if it was good enough for
[48:20] him shouldn't it be good enough for us
[48:23] if we're made in his likeness Made In
[48:25] His Image and he's wanting us to
[48:27] manifest that and declare that life we
[48:30] should not be ashamed of it people don't
[48:32] want you to talk about the Miracles that
[48:34] God has done shame on us
[48:36] God wants you to bring forth God wants
[48:38] you to make that declaration the
[48:40] evidence is a declaration it's a
[48:42] manifestation it's the Vindication that
[48:45] the life is still here and I'm here to
[48:47] tell the devil there's life on planet
[48:49] Earth
[48:50] come on their sons and daughters of God
[48:52] that has been born again of the spirit
[48:54] and the seed has been quickened and the
[48:56] life is coming forward and they're
[48:58] producing the same size the same wonders
[49:01] the same word with the same results
[49:04] oh come on Church get behind it tonight
[49:07] this is God's promise to you you've got
[49:09] every reason to rejoice and by who God's
[49:12] made you what God's called you to be I
[49:14] know we go through troubles in life but
[49:16] this ain't a time of trouble this is the
[49:18] season of the bringer
[49:22] so we're the Barefoot fruit
[49:26] notice this ain't apples and oranges
[49:29] put the bread for bring forth fruit and
[49:32] the word fruit here is offspring
[49:35] that's what God is looking for
[49:37] he's looking for one thing offspring
[49:41] he's looking for his own
[49:43] so he's bringing forth his sons and his
[49:45] daughters in his season and God sent us
[49:48] a message
[49:49] and God sent it in the season
[49:53] of a prophet
[49:55] what was that message sent for to
[49:57] Quicken the seed
[50:00] it was it was sent to turn the hearts of
[50:03] the other children back to the faith of
[50:05] the fathers
[50:07] that's the purpose
[50:09] of the Prophet that's the purpose of
[50:11] Malachi 4 excuse me and we look here in
[50:13] Revelations 10 7 in the days of the
[50:16] voice of the seventh angel
[50:18] we look here in the days of the voice of
[50:20] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[50:22] sound the mystery of God should be
[50:25] finished as he has declared unto his
[50:27] service the prophets
[50:28] it's probably a lot worse than
[50:32] I'm not going to struggle tonight
[50:38] so we find here in the days of the voice
[50:41] of the seventh angel the mystery of God
[50:43] should be finished the mystery of what
[50:46] of life
[50:49] then we find also that that uh that we
[50:52] find it is Christ in you is the hope of
[50:54] glory
[50:55] and we look here it's the season are the
[50:58] days of The Voice or the season of The
[51:00] Voice we're living in that day where the
[51:02] voice is already spoke
[51:04] sons and daughters are already becoming
[51:06] the manifestation and we look in
[51:08] Ephesians 1 and verse 3 the Bible would
[51:10] tell us blessed is the god and father of
[51:13] our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[51:15] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[51:18] places
[51:20] in Christ according as he has chosen Us
[51:22] in him before the foundation of the
[51:24] world that we should be holy Without
[51:26] Blame before him in love having
[51:29] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[51:31] children by Jesus Christ according to
[51:33] the good pleasure of his will
[51:35] in whom we have Redemption through his
[51:37] blood the forgiveness of sin according
[51:39] to the riches of his grace wherein he is
[51:42] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[51:43] Prudence having made known unto us and
[51:47] that phrase or having made no means to
[51:50] give to understand
[51:52] so he's given to you to understand the
[51:55] mystery of his will or the hidden
[51:58] purpose of his desire and it's according
[52:01] to his good pleasure or his choice
[52:04] that he has purposed or that he has set
[52:08] forth to bring
[52:10] so here we find God has made known to us
[52:13] not everybody gets this revelation
[52:17] not every seed that lay in the Earth is
[52:19] going to be quick and only the
[52:20] predestinated or to be quickened but the
[52:24] Bible tells us blessed is the man that
[52:26] walketh not in the counsel of the
[52:28] ungodly
[52:29] and brother Brandon will use this and he
[52:31] would preach the restoration of the
[52:32] Bride tree and we find that something is
[52:36] in this tree that we must speak about
[52:38] there's something in this tree why would
[52:40] God be so determined to restore this
[52:43] tree
[52:45] see this tree was to bring forth fruit
[52:49] yeah it was to bring forth fruit in
[52:51] God's season and we find here listen
[52:53] what the prophet of God says in the
[52:55] restoration of the broad tree could you
[52:57] please take out some of the highs
[52:59] because I'm still very tingy up here
[53:01] therefore it was predestinated fruit in
[53:05] the root of this tree
[53:08] predestinated fruit in the root of this
[53:11] tree and this tree could not wither
[53:14] because it was holding predestinated
[53:17] fruit
[53:18] that's the tree that Joel spoke about
[53:20] see it cannot die the worms eat it down
[53:23] but it could not die in its root it had
[53:27] predestinated truth it's God's word this
[53:30] tree otherwise Satan has tried to
[53:32] destroy this tree from the very
[53:34] beginning he's done everything he can to
[53:36] keep this broad tree from coming forth
[53:38] he doesn't want her to come to her full
[53:40] potential he doesn't want her to reach
[53:42] her full maturity he doesn't want her to
[53:44] recognize her full power and authority
[53:46] that lays in her he doesn't want this
[53:49] broad tree to bring forth Pride fruit oh
[53:52] but God has already spoken I will
[53:55] restore what does he restoring the same
[53:58] life that was in the root of that tree
[54:00] is going to manifest in Sons and
[54:02] Daughters of God today
[54:05] that's why this broad tree couldn't be
[54:06] destroyed that's why we're here today
[54:08] believing God sent a prophet and what a
[54:10] glorious message is because the original
[54:12] life that was been trying to be attacked
[54:15] through seven Church ages well the devil
[54:17] is trying to get it but God's been more
[54:19] determined to to bring forth sons and
[54:21] daughters in this hour
[54:22] [Music]
[54:24] notice
[54:26] he sent four destroying insects
[54:30] the locusts ate the fellowship man we
[54:32] can't even have Fellowship in the
[54:33] message anymore
[54:37] canker worms ain't to cover in the bark
[54:39] or the religion the caterpillar sucked
[54:41] the life out of it go to some Churches
[54:43] they're not an ounce of life in them
[54:45] sing a couple of songs invite you up a
[54:48] couple more invite you out
[54:52] there's no life
[54:55] and the problem what's the problem do
[54:57] eats the fruit
[55:00] but God said I will restore
[55:02] and we find that in the seventh Church
[55:04] age
[55:05] something begins to happen restoration
[55:07] begins to take place and we find that
[55:09] now these predestinated Seas have been
[55:11] quickened by predestinated messes
[55:13] because it's the prophet season and they
[55:16] begin to bring forth evidence of the
[55:18] original life
[55:19] not their own life not William branham's
[55:22] life not a prophet's life but they're
[55:23] bringing forth evidence of the original
[55:25] life and we look here he said this tree
[55:27] though it's been persecuted it's been
[55:30] made fun of since the very beginning of
[55:32] the Garden of Eden Eden it cannot die
[55:35] it's predestinated it's been clubbed
[55:38] it's been beat and everything done to it
[55:40] and what happened it cannot die he will
[55:43] not die he can't because he's holding in
[55:46] him the predestinated word of God that's
[55:49] what's laying within you that's the
[55:52] importance of this bride tree it has to
[55:54] come forth it see it's his fruit in his
[55:57] own season the predestinated season
[56:00] and Joe said I will restore saith the
[56:03] Lord
[56:04] for the predestination of God lays in
[56:06] the roots of the tree
[56:09] see God could have started with another
[56:11] tree but he didn't he use the same tree
[56:15] and he got down to the root got down to
[56:18] the stump but he didn't start over no He
[56:20] restored from that stump the very same
[56:22] life
[56:23] that was in the beginning is the very
[56:25] same life that's now in manifestation in
[56:27] Sons and Daughters of God the brother
[56:29] man will tell us now in the restoration
[56:30] of the Bright Tree he says now he set an
[56:32] order on the day of Pentecost the tree
[56:36] so on the day of Pentecost you find what
[56:39] Davis how they responded how they acted
[56:42] was the evidence of the original life
[56:46] okay I don't know about you but when I
[56:48] read about Pentecost and I hear about
[56:49] how they acted when they came out they
[56:51] come out stumbling they come out
[56:52] staggering they come out speaking in
[56:54] unknown languages and tongues and
[56:56] different things like that and they
[56:57] thought they were drunk that was the
[56:59] evidence of the original life and yet
[57:02] brother bams would tell us now he said
[57:04] the predestinated was established right
[57:07] there those predestinated Seas was
[57:09] established on the day of Pentecost and
[57:12] it bloomed out on the day of Pentecost
[57:14] and he says what is it doing it's
[57:16] bringing four Sons and Daughters of God
[57:18] the same word through the same Authority
[57:21] through the same power through the same
[57:23] manifestation the things that he did we
[57:25] are to do also
[57:28] so what kind of fruit are we to bring
[57:30] just like he says in John 14 12. he that
[57:33] believeth on me and the works that I do
[57:34] shall you do also
[57:36] Play Hands on the sick we shouldn't be
[57:38] fearful of laying hands on the sick I
[57:40] think our pastor did an excellent job
[57:42] speaking about that on Sunday but don't
[57:44] be afraid you should expect God to do
[57:47] the miraculous before you stretch your
[57:49] hand out you say oh God I believe this
[57:52] is the word and I'm a Son of God and I
[57:54] got the authority through the scriptures
[57:56] to lay my hands on my brother lay my
[57:58] hands on my sister in the same life that
[58:00] you that that projected from you when
[58:02] you walk the shores of Galilee is the
[58:04] very same life that's here in this
[58:06] building tonight and it'll produce the
[58:08] same results with the same Faith every
[58:10] time Church
[58:11] [Music]
[58:13] notice I'm so glad brother bam says now
[58:16] I'm so glad that I believe that God
[58:18] planted a holy ghost seed on the day of
[58:20] Pentecost
[58:21] that hybrided into a denomination but
[58:24] after a while it's going back to its
[58:27] original again back to the real Holy
[58:29] Ghost back to the gospel message back to
[58:31] Acts 2 again back to the former where
[58:34] Back to Where it All Began
[58:38] so why because there's fruit in the root
[58:42] there's life in the stump
[58:45] God's not going to throw the stump away
[58:47] because there's life there what am I
[58:49] telling you you were in the stump
[58:53] you were in the stump the life was in
[58:56] the tree and those Satan's tried
[58:58] everything he can to destroy your life
[59:00] to destroy your seed and destroy your
[59:03] grandparents and great grandparents God
[59:05] still watched over that because he says
[59:07] I'm going to restore
[59:09] I'm going to restore the predestinated
[59:12] fruit and they're going to come up in
[59:14] the last age and they're going to
[59:16] manifest they're going to bring forth
[59:18] evidence of my life of that original
[59:20] life
[59:21] so he would tell us now the Holy Spirit
[59:25] transforms the seed word into its
[59:27] likeness it's like a pear tree it brings
[59:30] forth a pair in an apple tree it brings
[59:33] forth an apple and he said and the word
[59:35] will bring forth Sons and Daughters of
[59:37] God that's what it's supposed to do
[59:40] so if you claim to be a son and daughter
[59:42] of God and yet you don't believe the
[59:44] word that the days of Miracles has
[59:46] passed or you believe that the days is a
[59:48] miracle in the past and it was only for
[59:50] brother Branham but then you don't
[59:51] believe the word of God
[59:54] something is missing the life is missing
[59:56] so we find here in Romans 8 and verse 29
[1:00:00] I think I spoke on this just briefly
[1:00:02] before in the last service from the
[1:00:04] emphatic dog lot
[1:00:07] he said because because whom he foreknew
[1:00:10] he before marked out copies of the
[1:00:13] likeness of his son to himself
[1:00:15] otherwise this word copper is a
[1:00:17] duplicate
[1:00:19] it's a reproduction it's a reprint it's
[1:00:21] a replica the thing that is made to be
[1:00:24] similar or identical to another so we
[1:00:26] are a replica a similarity we are
[1:00:29] identical to God
[1:00:33] how many of you feel like that every day
[1:00:34] you get up man I feel identical to God
[1:00:36] today praise God who I'm going to
[1:00:38] overcome no
[1:00:40] that's why you got to come back to the
[1:00:42] word and look at what the word says
[1:00:43] about it this is what the word tells you
[1:00:46] you who you are because Satan is trying
[1:00:48] to destroy that predestinated seed he
[1:00:51] doesn't want the fruit to come forth
[1:00:53] from that seed and we find here in the
[1:00:55] Bible that it would tell us and you that
[1:00:57] were sometimes alienated alienated and
[1:01:00] enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet
[1:01:02] now hath he reconciled First Corinthians
[1:01:05] 6 and verse 9 know you not that the
[1:01:07] unrighteousness shall not inherit the
[1:01:09] kingdom of God
[1:01:11] be not deceived neither fornicators nor
[1:01:14] idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate
[1:01:17] nor abusers of themselves what mankind
[1:01:19] Northeast nor Covetous nor drunkers no
[1:01:21] rivalers no extortion or shall inherit
[1:01:23] the kingdom of God
[1:01:25] and the Bible says in such were some of
[1:01:27] you
[1:01:29] but that was the first birth
[1:01:31] but thank God God doesn't leave us in
[1:01:33] the first birth condition but God said
[1:01:36] but you are washed
[1:01:37] come on you know where we're going with
[1:01:39] this you were a wash you are Sanctified
[1:01:41] you are justified in the name of the
[1:01:43] Lord by the spirit of God God knew that
[1:01:46] there was another life laying on the
[1:01:48] inside of it and though Satan tried to
[1:01:50] cover it up with adultery and idolatry
[1:01:52] and all this other stuff to keep you
[1:01:54] from Reaching Your Potential but you are
[1:01:56] watching that word watch this you are
[1:01:58] loose today church you've been loosed by
[1:02:01] the power of God sons of God come forth
[1:02:03] in the name of Jesus same can't hold
[1:02:05] over you any longer you've got a promise
[1:02:07] I will restore I will bring forth fruit
[1:02:11] in my season and it's the season of the
[1:02:14] bringer it's to see the first Sons and
[1:02:16] Daughters of God to manifest his life
[1:02:20] and it's a perfect blood that's loosed
[1:02:23] us therefore it's the perfect Lucy
[1:02:25] but you find Satan
[1:02:28] he couldn't dig up those Seas the
[1:02:30] prophet would tell us but he he sprayed
[1:02:33] them
[1:02:34] and he deformed the seed and
[1:02:37] he said he sprayed him with unbelief and
[1:02:39] doubt and science filled this place
[1:02:41] where the cavity is and he went into the
[1:02:44] seed and Satan filled that cavity with
[1:02:45] knowledge and Science and civilization
[1:02:48] and it's deformed a whole entire
[1:02:50] creation of God
[1:02:53] and see Satan tried to spray Jesus
[1:02:55] he tried to spray him but he fell see he
[1:02:58] he had a repellent on him
[1:03:00] you want to know what that repellent was
[1:03:03] it was a repellent of predestination
[1:03:07] see they couldn't take him they couldn't
[1:03:09] make him a Pharisee or a sad to see they
[1:03:11] couldn't make him belong to some
[1:03:12] organization he was God's predestinated
[1:03:15] spoken word see Satan couldn't throw his
[1:03:18] unbelief on him he had a repellent on
[1:03:20] him and brother will say God spray us
[1:03:22] with the repellent is my spring my
[1:03:25] prayer
[1:03:25] well I say God's praying me today with
[1:03:28] so much going on in our society so many
[1:03:30] people walking away so much unbelief and
[1:03:33] doubt that surrounding this message
[1:03:34] God's pray me with that repellent of
[1:03:37] predestination Lord let me be filled
[1:03:39] with the Holy Ghost the keeping power to
[1:03:41] keep me from giving in to the lives of
[1:03:43] the enemy
[1:03:46] he said they tried to get him to do
[1:03:47] everything one night he was laying on
[1:03:48] the back of the ship seen him asleep and
[1:03:50] he said I'll destroy him but he couldn't
[1:03:52] he tried to tempt him into doing
[1:03:53] something wrong but he couldn't see he
[1:03:55] tried to spray him with the repellent
[1:03:57] but he had a repellent of predestination
[1:03:59] see they can't be deceived no the word
[1:04:01] said that he would be here amen there
[1:04:04] ain't no devil going to bother him nor
[1:04:06] any other Son of God did you hear that
[1:04:09] no devil going to bother him nor any
[1:04:12] other Son of God why because you have
[1:04:14] been sprayed with a repellent of
[1:04:16] predestination Satan can't get to that
[1:04:18] life because God's got a promise over I
[1:04:21] will bring forth
[1:04:24] oh Hallelujah
[1:04:26] that's why you can't be deceived because
[1:04:28] the elect can't beat himself
[1:04:31] because it's not your life it's his life
[1:04:33] that's why you don't belong to a
[1:04:35] denomination that's why you haven't
[1:04:36] walked away from this message when so
[1:04:38] many have
[1:04:39] it's because you're the spoken word seed
[1:04:41] with the repellent of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:44] that's who you are so when you wake up
[1:04:46] in the morning just let the devil Know
[1:04:48] Who You Are I am been sprayed Satan with
[1:04:51] the repellent of predestination I got
[1:04:54] the Holy Ghost on the inside of me you
[1:04:56] may make my life a living hell but you
[1:04:58] can't get down to the Sea you can't get
[1:05:01] down to the bottom of it because right
[1:05:03] there it's already been quicker it's
[1:05:05] already been made alive say you can't do
[1:05:07] nothing but make my life happy but I
[1:05:09] want you to know you can't get the life
[1:05:11] on the inside and I'm here to declare
[1:05:13] I'm going to produce evidence that it
[1:05:15] ain't me but it's him if it was my
[1:05:17] desires I'd be gone but it ain't my
[1:05:19] desires
[1:05:21] I'm not walking by my own efforts I'm
[1:05:23] walking by faith
[1:05:25] so many people have been sprayed with
[1:05:27] Satan's reasons his lies is unbelief his
[1:05:30] doubts
[1:05:31] people that used to sit Among Us
[1:05:33] people used to be in some of the
[1:05:35] meetings where you said 10.
[1:05:37] they claim but they're free
[1:05:40] that they're no longer in bondage
[1:05:43] I still haven't figured that one out
[1:05:46] they're no longer in bonnet's first
[1:05:48] thing that happens the wife cuts her
[1:05:50] hair
[1:05:51] starts putting on makeup
[1:05:53] wearing pants drinking
[1:05:55] they Venture completely out toward they
[1:05:57] don't even not only do they not believe
[1:05:58] God's in a prophet and they believe the
[1:06:00] message is wrong they believe the Bible
[1:06:01] is wrong and they end up in complete
[1:06:04] apostasy
[1:06:05] atheists or agnostics
[1:06:07] and they claim that they're following
[1:06:09] the Bible and Bible teachings yet
[1:06:10] they're breaking every scripture to fit
[1:06:13] their own selfish desires
[1:06:16] and the reason being is because they
[1:06:18] have not received the repellent
[1:06:21] a predestination
[1:06:22] the repellent of the Holy Ghost they
[1:06:25] have not become inoculated with the
[1:06:26] power of God to overcome Satan poisonous
[1:06:29] spray of unbelief and doubt
[1:06:32] but we have
[1:06:35] but you young people have
[1:06:37] that's why we can act the way we Act
[1:06:40] don't get shallowed out that's fine we
[1:06:42] can act the way we are we're going to go
[1:06:43] down that road here in just a minute see
[1:06:45] brother Bama would tell us now don't
[1:06:46] stumble
[1:06:48] at this word predestination
[1:06:50] he goes if you are a Christian now
[1:06:52] genuine predestinated seed you was in
[1:06:55] God before you always was in God the
[1:06:58] germ of life which is an attribute of
[1:07:00] God which was a thought he says if how
[1:07:02] many of you are here tonight
[1:07:06] so in order for you to be here you had
[1:07:07] to be in the loins of your father
[1:07:10] and your great-grandfather and great
[1:07:12] great great great and we can keep on
[1:07:13] going down you had to be somewhere
[1:07:15] before you came here right the only
[1:07:17] thing you were needing was a bedding
[1:07:19] ground to bring forth that life and so
[1:07:21] we find the prophet of God say if you
[1:07:23] wasn't in your father then you wouldn't
[1:07:25] be here and if you wasn't in God if you
[1:07:28] believe the message of the Bible and the
[1:07:30] present messes of the day it's a
[1:07:32] Vindication of it the reason you are
[1:07:34] sitting here is because you were
[1:07:36] predestinated to sit here
[1:07:39] come on somebody I say glory to God the
[1:07:41] reason that I'm here tonight and I
[1:07:43] haven't give up and I'm still pressing
[1:07:45] the battle it's because I'm
[1:07:47] predestinated to be here I'm
[1:07:49] predestinated to push to battle I
[1:07:51] predestinated to stand when so many have
[1:07:53] given up and walked away oh that's who I
[1:07:55] am I'm a predestinated son and daughter
[1:07:58] of God
[1:08:00] projecting the evidence of the original
[1:08:03] life
[1:08:05] notice you're predestinated
[1:08:08] he goes you wouldn't have been here
[1:08:09] otherwise you'd been out on the street
[1:08:10] maybe drunks some of you may be out
[1:08:12] there running around with some man's
[1:08:14] wife or some wife's husband and you know
[1:08:16] so forth but you are predestinated to be
[1:08:18] here you can't help it you have a father
[1:08:21] he is God and you are his seed
[1:08:25] oh praise the Lord Church
[1:08:28] man look over your genealogy look over
[1:08:30] your family tree that family tree is
[1:08:32] pretty ugly
[1:08:33] got a lot of sin in that tree got a lot
[1:08:35] of mishaps in that tree but if you look
[1:08:37] over in his tree you look over in that
[1:08:39] original tree you look over there and
[1:08:41] you say oh fat every fat tree ever puts
[1:08:44] forth another branch
[1:08:45] oh when it puts forth it ain't gonna be
[1:08:47] denominational it ain't gonna be drunk
[1:08:49] it ain't gonna be a druggie it ain't
[1:08:51] gonna be a prostitute it's going to be
[1:08:53] like that original and it's going to
[1:08:55] protect the original life and it's going
[1:08:56] to bring forth the original Fruit and
[1:08:58] it's going to lay hands on the sick and
[1:09:00] they gonna recover it's going to believe
[1:09:02] in prayer lives and altar calls and
[1:09:04] young people coming to God I'm here to
[1:09:06] tell you we're in a day Church of the
[1:09:08] branch praying forth more fruit
[1:09:13] notice what he says
[1:09:15] predestinated as he was makes the word
[1:09:18] seed flesh
[1:09:20] and All Sons and Daughters of God are
[1:09:23] predestinated
[1:09:27] man I'm looking at a bunch of
[1:09:28] predestinated sons of God
[1:09:32] though you woke up you didn't feel
[1:09:33] predestinated
[1:09:35] oh you woke up and all you saw was
[1:09:37] heartache and shame and difficulty but
[1:09:39] oh you're predestinated
[1:09:41] oh Hallelujah notice God foresaw and
[1:09:45] predestinated a world of sons and
[1:09:47] daughters
[1:09:49] he predestinated him to be there but we
[1:09:52] find that disbelieving God's word caused
[1:09:54] High breeding but God has put it right
[1:09:56] back again that you don't have to hybrid
[1:09:59] anymore you can come right back to the
[1:10:02] original word and be a Son of God just
[1:10:05] like you were supposed to be at the
[1:10:07] beginning
[1:10:11] oh Hallelujah
[1:10:13] you think about family strains and I've
[1:10:15] mentioned this before
[1:10:17] family Stranger Family attributes
[1:10:20] and there's attributes in our kids that
[1:10:23] are yours
[1:10:25] like my daughter Rebecca you know I was
[1:10:28] going there
[1:10:29] he doesn't look like me she's beautiful
[1:10:30] I'm not
[1:10:32] she's blonde-headed I'm not
[1:10:34] she can sing I can't
[1:10:37] but I'll tell you what she can do
[1:10:39] she can bring forth the same fire and
[1:10:42] passion that I can because it's an
[1:10:44] attribute though she didn't want it she
[1:10:47] didn't ask for it it was bread in her
[1:10:50] and if that can be in the natural what
[1:10:52] about our heavenly father the same
[1:10:55] attributes of Love of joy and peace of
[1:10:58] gentleness and all that and you know
[1:10:59] what it's okay to have a little bit of
[1:11:01] fire too because God can direct that
[1:11:03] same fire and that same passion and that
[1:11:05] same temper he can Channel it so you can
[1:11:08] be a Satan Destroyer
[1:11:11] don't worry about oh I'm so high
[1:11:13] temperate oh what am I going to do with
[1:11:14] this I'm never gonna make it no you just
[1:11:16] give that temper to God and let God make
[1:11:18] out of what he will God can take that
[1:11:20] temper and Destroy Satan's kingdom and
[1:11:22] set you as a testimony to show you that
[1:11:25] that life surrendered to God can bring
[1:11:27] forth praise to his name
[1:11:30] because why it's not your life it's his
[1:11:32] life that he's wanting to protect
[1:11:36] he says in John 15 and verse 4 I say he
[1:11:39] this is in red letter in my Bible so
[1:11:42] it's he
[1:11:43] about in me and I and you as a branch
[1:11:45] cannot bear fruit of itself except it
[1:11:47] abide and divine no more can you accept
[1:11:49] you abide in me I am the vine and you
[1:11:52] are the branches he that abideth in me
[1:11:54] and I in him the same bringeth forth
[1:11:55] much fruit for without me you can do
[1:11:58] nothing
[1:11:59] and the message perseverance he said
[1:12:01] I've seen the other day a tree with nine
[1:12:04] different citrus fruits
[1:12:07] they had a pomegranate they had a great
[1:12:09] fruit of lemon and orange but the
[1:12:11] original tree wasn't orange and he said
[1:12:13] Mr shared he said well how is this being
[1:12:16] that it's an orange tree he said you
[1:12:17] just split the tree
[1:12:19] and you graft it in there
[1:12:24] right he says well then if it brings
[1:12:25] forth will it bring forth an orange he
[1:12:27] said no it'll bring forth after his
[1:12:29] count or after it's kind he says there
[1:12:31] you are brother when I tell you when
[1:12:33] churches are grafted into Christ such as
[1:12:36] they try supposed to be just slid in
[1:12:38] there by name calling themselves the
[1:12:40] Churches of Christ and when they do what
[1:12:43] do they bring to nominational fruits
[1:12:46] but if the branch ever brings forth
[1:12:49] another limb it'll be like the first one
[1:12:51] was and then another message the
[1:12:53] anointing ones at the end time he says
[1:12:55] you can graft it in there you see every
[1:12:57] grapefruit lemon tangelo Tangerine
[1:12:59] whatever the citrus fruits they are
[1:13:01] every one of them can live in that tree
[1:13:03] but they're bearing false witness of the
[1:13:07] tree
[1:13:07] living by the tree they're living and
[1:13:10] thriving on the genuine life of the tree
[1:13:13] but they're bringing or they're they're
[1:13:16] manifesting a false witness of the tree
[1:13:19] because it ain't the original life
[1:13:21] that's living out from them
[1:13:26] so denominational fruits
[1:13:29] denominational seeds can cannot bring
[1:13:32] forth spoken word offspring
[1:13:35] denominational seeds will bring forth
[1:13:37] denominational children that have
[1:13:39] produced denominational fruit
[1:13:41] they will bring forth hybrid children
[1:13:42] who can't breed themselves back to the
[1:13:45] word
[1:13:46] oh they can see it God was a Healer
[1:13:49] yesterday but that's not who he is today
[1:13:51] see they have a form of godliness but
[1:13:53] they deny the power of God they will
[1:13:56] bring forth notice now this
[1:13:57] denominational fruit they're going to
[1:13:59] bring forth great teachers who will rely
[1:14:01] on their education and their human
[1:14:02] intellect and their human abilities and
[1:14:04] what have they done they substituted
[1:14:06] classes for the Holy Ghost experience
[1:14:10] we have churches now even in the message
[1:14:12] that's having classes that teach our
[1:14:14] young boys how to overcome pornography
[1:14:17] we don't need a class
[1:14:20] come on church we don't need a class on
[1:14:22] how to overcome pornography what we need
[1:14:24] to do is preach the power of the Holy
[1:14:26] Ghost back in the church get behind the
[1:14:28] pulprit preach God alive not dead not a
[1:14:31] god of yesterday but a God all right now
[1:14:33] with same signs same ones the same
[1:14:36] keeping power I'm here's a testimony
[1:14:38] right here that God can give you the
[1:14:40] overcoming power young men and young
[1:14:42] women to overcome pornography and lust
[1:14:45] devils and drink it or any other thing
[1:14:47] we can't just go around and substitute
[1:14:49] the power of God for some class we don't
[1:14:52] need a class we got the original life
[1:14:55] it's put the original life back behind
[1:14:57] the pulpit and let him preach
[1:15:01] if they can't handle the word they ain't
[1:15:03] of the word
[1:15:05] before we find notice they have
[1:15:07] intellectual jobs they preach or they
[1:15:09] teach psychology
[1:15:10] now you got to cope with your issues
[1:15:13] they'll have prayer lines
[1:15:15] you just got to go figure it out
[1:15:17] you got kids out of trouble they give
[1:15:19] you a Dr Dobson tape figure it out
[1:15:21] listen to him he'll help you with your
[1:15:22] kids

[1:15:26] he never stepped foot in my house I
[1:15:28] ain't giving Dr Dawson credit for my
[1:15:30] kids
[1:15:31] nor shall you give Dr Dobson or any Dave
[1:15:34] Rams or anybody else credit for
[1:15:36] something that God's already done for
[1:15:37] you
[1:15:38] [Applause]
[1:15:40] oh but what we've done we've taken great
[1:15:42] great intellectual Giants and they begin
[1:15:44] to explain the supernatural way
[1:15:48] they explain to you why we don't need
[1:15:50] tongues why we don't need why God
[1:15:53] doesn't heal like he used to the days of
[1:15:54] Miracles has passed wrong it was only
[1:15:56] for brother Branham or you can receive
[1:15:57] the Holy Ghost without a sensation
[1:16:01] you can receive the Holy Ghost without
[1:16:03] sensation I guarantee you know what you
[1:16:05] may not know when you got it but if you
[1:16:07] ever get it you're gonna you're gonna
[1:16:08] know that you got it how many of you
[1:16:10] mothers are are have been or your mother
[1:16:13] hey how about that
[1:16:14] you done brought forth the child right
[1:16:16] you may have not known the exact date
[1:16:18] that you got pregnant
[1:16:19] but in nine months there was no deny
[1:16:22] that you were bringing forth life and
[1:16:23] what am I telling you the same way with
[1:16:25] the Holy Ghost you may have not known
[1:16:26] what service you may have not known what
[1:16:28] a day you may have known known whatever
[1:16:30] but eventually you begin to realize that
[1:16:33] there was something on the inside of it
[1:16:35] because you begin to respond to the word
[1:16:37] you begin to move by the word and the
[1:16:39] word begins to move inside of you and
[1:16:41] the word begins to come out Hallelujah a
[1:16:43] word begins to protect itself that
[1:16:45] there's a life on the inside no longer
[1:16:48] am I walking by myself but I'm walking
[1:16:50] with Christ and he's walking with me and
[1:16:52] he's projecting forth his life
[1:16:57] they want to explain why
[1:16:59] you can be healed just in your seat I
[1:17:02] believe that
[1:17:04] you can be healed just in your seat
[1:17:06] there's no sense of having a prayer line
[1:17:08] that's just a Jewish tradition
[1:17:11] well your Prophet did it
[1:17:13] and if it was good enough for a prophet
[1:17:15] it's good enough for me
[1:17:16] because I'm staying with the prophet
[1:17:18] message
[1:17:19] I had a brother tell me I'll preached
[1:17:20] some meetings a while back had a brother
[1:17:22] tell me I had an altar called young
[1:17:23] people all over the altar for hours they
[1:17:26] kept coming
[1:17:27] and they kept moving the church said we
[1:17:30] have never had an altar call like that
[1:17:32] in this entire time we've been in church
[1:17:34] and I had a predominant Pastor come up
[1:17:36] to me at the end of it he said the
[1:17:38] miracle of it is is that they
[1:17:40] acknowledged
[1:17:42] that they just acknowledged by lifting
[1:17:44] up their hand
[1:17:45] we have made the word of God just so
[1:17:48] watered down that we can just not show
[1:17:50] forth
[1:17:51] we could just do it in our and not
[1:17:53] believe we can do it in our seat but I
[1:17:54] also believe you've got to respond to it
[1:17:57] and if there's a real life on the inside
[1:17:58] of you you're not worried about your
[1:18:00] neighbor you're not worried about who's
[1:18:01] looking at you you're not worried you're
[1:18:03] just worried about one thing I got to
[1:18:04] get there I got to get in his presence I
[1:18:06] got to get this seed on the inside
[1:18:07] quickened by the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:09] but you find great intellectual jobs
[1:18:11] they begin to explain the word away from
[1:18:15] you
[1:18:17] he goes when you explain away the
[1:18:19] supernatural out of the Bible you're
[1:18:21] explaining away the very God that you
[1:18:23] worship
[1:18:24] he's a supernatural God
[1:18:28] so denominational Seas bring forth to
[1:18:31] nominational branches which produce
[1:18:33] denominational fruit and they rely on
[1:18:35] Traditions Creeds their interpretation
[1:18:37] are their churches interpretation of the
[1:18:39] word their psychology
[1:18:41] and they can never breed themselves back
[1:18:44] to the original life
[1:18:47] see but God didn't plant denominational
[1:18:49] seeds God planted spoken word see and
[1:18:53] that's why you're here tonight because
[1:18:55] you're not some denominational see
[1:18:56] you're not some Baptist walking in even
[1:18:58] like Tabernacle trying to project your
[1:19:00] Baptist ideas or your Pentecostal ideas
[1:19:02] or your Episcopalian ideas or whatever
[1:19:04] ideas your own Humanity ideas no but
[1:19:07] you're here to project The Life of
[1:19:08] Christ
[1:19:10] because you are of that Original Seed
[1:19:13] program says now
[1:19:15] he said the nominational cities of the
[1:19:17] churches had been planted the
[1:19:18] Pentecostal seeds have been planted into
[1:19:20] the Pentecost organizations by great men
[1:19:22] like Oral Roberts and Tommy Hicks and
[1:19:24] Tommy arms and great men and I believe
[1:19:26] that the word of God has been planted
[1:19:29] unadulterated away from any of those
[1:19:31] organizations
[1:19:33] God has planted a word
[1:19:36] and the man that's been planted or the
[1:19:38] tree he's going to be a man is going to
[1:19:40] be planted like a tree that's been
[1:19:41] planted by the rivers of water you don't
[1:19:44] plant a tree when it's full grown you
[1:19:45] plant it when it's in seed form
[1:19:47] but you got to put it in the right
[1:19:48] atmosphere
[1:19:49] you got to put it where the waters are
[1:19:51] flowing over it
[1:19:53] oh when you do he's going to bring forth
[1:19:56] his fruit
[1:19:57] in his season it's going to manifest can
[1:20:00] we look at that just for a little bit as
[1:20:01] we start trying to wind this down
[1:20:04] notice he would tell us now and it
[1:20:06] wasn't so from the beginning he goes you
[1:20:07] hear people say I'm Presbyterian and I'm
[1:20:10] Methodist and I'm Baptist and I'm this
[1:20:12] and I'm that
[1:20:13] and you got it around our ranks I'm
[1:20:15] seven Thunders and I'm Perugia and I'm
[1:20:17] two Soul no soul three Soul however many
[1:20:20] Souls I'm look I got one
[1:20:22] man lucky you you got all three of them
[1:20:25] well you find we got all this I'm this
[1:20:26] I'm that I'm all this he says that's the
[1:20:29] way that he says now in the beginning
[1:20:30] that's the way God said in his church up
[1:20:32] on the day of Pentecost that's the way
[1:20:34] it is to Forever remain if you cross
[1:20:37] anything else up in it in the
[1:20:39] denominations and all these other things
[1:20:41] and sprinkling and all the forms and
[1:20:43] things in your hybrid it you may get a
[1:20:45] better look in church but it ain't got
[1:20:46] no life
[1:20:49] oh it may be a beautiful Church it may
[1:20:51] be packing 500 people they may be
[1:20:53] preaching the message of the hour using
[1:20:55] a very saying quotes but the church is
[1:20:57] dead
[1:20:58] and the people are dead because why
[1:21:01] because there is no life being preached
[1:21:03] in the church
[1:21:07] but if you
[1:21:10] have met God on the backside of that
[1:21:12] desert
[1:21:13] and you know that you know that you know
[1:21:15] that you know that you know that you met
[1:21:16] him
[1:21:18] you didn't meet a denominational idea he
[1:21:20] didn't meet a man's idea but you met him
[1:21:23] and that seed on the inside of you
[1:21:25] become quickened you can't help but to
[1:21:28] bring forth the evidence of his life
[1:21:33] program says that we need to breathe in
[1:21:35] the Holy Ghost religion holy ghost power
[1:21:38] where is God God is in his church God is
[1:21:40] in his word God is in his people God is
[1:21:42] in his Universe he's everywhere but we
[1:21:44] can't hybrid him into something because
[1:21:46] he won't cross up with nothing he's God
[1:21:49] and God alone you can't breed him into
[1:21:51] five or six different things four or
[1:21:53] five different gods he's God and God
[1:21:55] alone and he won't hybrid it he's God
[1:21:59] and God said let me or let us make man
[1:22:02] in our image and he sends the spirit to
[1:22:05] do what to Quicken the word to life
[1:22:09] so he sends the spirit and he says in a
[1:22:12] spoken word is the Original Seed the
[1:22:13] seed plant must have seed water before
[1:22:16] it can grow it must have water to fall
[1:22:19] before the seed that's been planted can
[1:22:21] grow so don't be afraid of the spirit
[1:22:23] father
[1:22:25] that's not so much for you guys here but
[1:22:28] that's for those on the stream don't be
[1:22:29] afraid of the seed falling it's just
[1:22:32] seed water that's been sent to Quicken
[1:22:34] the seed plants
[1:22:36] see the spirit is sent to bring those
[1:22:38] predestinated Seas to life if you're
[1:22:41] going to be afraid of anything be afraid
[1:22:43] when there is no spirit
[1:22:44] be afraid where there is no anointing be
[1:22:47] afraid where there is no life be afraid
[1:22:49] where they don't believe in the
[1:22:51] Supernatural and then they got cold
[1:22:53] formal and then different toward the
[1:22:54] message of the hour
[1:22:56] though yet they're under the auspice we
[1:22:58] believe God sent a prophet but we've
[1:23:00] gotten so revelated we've got the reveal
[1:23:02] word now that we don't need all that
[1:23:04] nonsense
[1:23:11] the nominations were hatch denominations
[1:23:14] but the word will bring forth the word
[1:23:19] their word will bring forth the word we
[1:23:22] find in Joel 2 as we start wrapping up
[1:23:25] he says be glad all you children of Zion
[1:23:27] rejoice in the Lord your God for he has
[1:23:30] given you the former Reign moderately
[1:23:31] and he will cause a come down for you
[1:23:34] the rain the former rain and the latter
[1:23:36] rain in the first month this word former
[1:23:39] Reign is the teaching reign
[1:23:42] and brother Bob says the nominational
[1:23:43] teaching Reign has gone forth a million
[1:23:46] more and 44 Baptist so-and-so members
[1:23:48] and Oral Roberts and them brothers with
[1:23:50] the Pentecostal move economic great
[1:23:51] Pentecostal move and they moved up into
[1:23:53] the millions and the seed has went forth
[1:23:55] and the word he said for the for the
[1:23:57] minority of the little group but he says
[1:23:59] the menorah Reign or the teaching rain
[1:24:01] the teaching rain went forth Billy
[1:24:03] Graham has struck the world of
[1:24:05] Pentecostals has struck the world and
[1:24:07] the word has struck the world
[1:24:11] notice all these seeds have been planted
[1:24:13] at the same time
[1:24:15] the teaching Reign has gone forth and
[1:24:18] we've had a great teaching Ministry on
[1:24:19] the brother Branham
[1:24:21] it's absolutely placed us where we
[1:24:23] needed to be it's put you in position
[1:24:25] you as a Son of God but what he said now
[1:24:28] now she is waiting for the latter rain
[1:24:32] and what is that he says that's when she
[1:24:35] produces her fruits
[1:24:38] see then the kind of seed that you
[1:24:40] planted in your field will be the same
[1:24:41] kind of crop that you'll reap if the
[1:24:43] denominations want more members that's
[1:24:45] what they're going to get Pentecostal
[1:24:47] want more Pentecostals that's what
[1:24:48] they're going to get but the word is
[1:24:51] going to produce Sons and Daughters of
[1:24:53] God and that's coming too
[1:24:56] so we're living in the day Church of the
[1:24:59] latter rain
[1:25:01] that's why some of you act the way you
[1:25:03] act
[1:25:04] you can't help it
[1:25:06] when the latter rain falls on that seed
[1:25:08] and you begin to act beside yourself
[1:25:10] doing things you didn't think you would
[1:25:13] do listen we're living in the day of a
[1:25:15] lot of rain we're living in a day of the
[1:25:16] outpouring of quickening power or the
[1:25:18] seed that had been laid dormant for so
[1:25:20] many ages has now come to rapturing
[1:25:23] Faith under a rapturing message and it's
[1:25:25] quickened that seed and Satan can't keep
[1:25:28] that bright tree down any longer why
[1:25:30] because she's manifesting the very Life
[1:25:33] of Christ
[1:25:36] see it's gonna Bloom out in the evening
[1:25:38] time
[1:25:40] oh my
[1:25:42] and I'll say this for those that are on
[1:25:45] the stream and those that may get the
[1:25:46] archive if brother Branham did not
[1:25:48] fulfill Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 Revelations
[1:25:50] 10 7 then where's the man at
[1:25:54] you tell me where is he at you walked
[1:25:56] away from a Vindicated message
[1:25:59] and you said that oh he's a false
[1:26:02] prophet
[1:26:03] but you tell me if he didn't fulfill
[1:26:05] Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 Revelation is 10
[1:26:08] then where is the one that has to
[1:26:10] fulfill these scriptures because our
[1:26:12] hearts have to be turned back the son of
[1:26:15] man has to be revealed and the Mystery
[1:26:18] of God has to be made known
[1:26:20] oh Church don't let them scare you
[1:26:22] anymore they just not see but the reason
[1:26:25] why you can believe it the reason why
[1:26:27] you do believe it is because your heart
[1:26:29] has been turned back and because the son
[1:26:31] of man has been revealed to you and the
[1:26:34] Mystery of Life of your life has been
[1:26:37] made manifest and you're what are you
[1:26:39] doing you're producing you're
[1:26:41] manifesting you're the Vindication that
[1:26:44] his life is once again on Earth today
[1:26:46] and is projecting forth and Sons and
[1:26:49] Daughters of God
[1:26:52] see this was umbrella Brandon's messes
[1:26:54] but it was God's message to the elect it
[1:26:58] was God's voice to Quicken a seed but so
[1:27:01] many
[1:27:02] had put their attention on a man
[1:27:04] and they missed a voice
[1:27:07] they put their attention on a man and
[1:27:09] they missed a supernatural power they
[1:27:11] missed the latter rain they missed the
[1:27:13] quickening of the seed and today we
[1:27:17] don't need prayer lines
[1:27:18] today we don't eat Arthur calls today we
[1:27:21] don't need all that nonsense speaking in
[1:27:24] tongues blabbering
[1:27:33] notice now
[1:27:36] he says our Traditions our church Creeds
[1:27:38] will never satisfy our heart that's
[1:27:40] being called by God
[1:27:42] you cannot make him say the Apostles
[1:27:44] Creed or be sprinkled or something like
[1:27:46] that and be satisfied with it when the
[1:27:48] hunger of God is in his soul he will go
[1:27:50] back to Pentecost to the beginning to
[1:27:52] find the real holy ghost that sets his
[1:27:55] heart aflame
[1:27:56] so no Pentecostal
[1:27:59] so listen
[1:28:00] let me go back real quick every church
[1:28:02] that rises up out of the vine will be a
[1:28:04] Pentecostal Church
[1:28:06] and people don't want it they don't want
[1:28:08] that I mean every church that rises out
[1:28:11] of that Pentecostal Vine is going to be
[1:28:13] a Pentecostal church and now you say you
[1:28:16] don't want it
[1:28:17] you don't want the supernatural you
[1:28:19] don't want the size you don't want the
[1:28:21] same thing they had there what are you
[1:28:23] doing you're rejecting the life
[1:28:27] you're saying you don't want to but yet
[1:28:29] when he established his church when he
[1:28:31] set forth that broad tree he did it on
[1:28:34] the day of Pentecost
[1:28:36] because what was he doing he was placing
[1:28:38] his life in his body
[1:28:41] and that life is going to manifest down
[1:28:43] through every age
[1:28:45] so we find here the very if every church
[1:28:48] that rises out of that vine will be a
[1:28:50] Pentecostal church with the same signs
[1:28:53] notice what he says the same Wonders
[1:28:55] that the first Vine produce or the first
[1:28:57] Branch produced it'll be like Pentecost
[1:29:00] every church that rises out of the vine
[1:29:02] will be a Pentecostal Church
[1:29:08] yeah that's your prophet
[1:29:11] deal with it
[1:29:13] when you deny the power of God you're
[1:29:16] denying this word
[1:29:17] you deny signs and wonders you're
[1:29:19] denying the word you're been you're
[1:29:21] denying the life of God
[1:29:25] so let's just look let's look just real
[1:29:27] quick
[1:29:29] I'm gonna pass over some things because
[1:29:30] I want to just drive it home right here
[1:29:32] we find here the vine is always
[1:29:34] energizes the branch and the branch
[1:29:37] Bears the fruit if the vine cannot bear
[1:29:39] fruit is depending on the branches and
[1:29:40] the branch cannot bear fruit until it's
[1:29:42] energized by the vibe and if a Christian
[1:29:44] Church is divine or the branch that's in
[1:29:46] Christ they'll do the works of Christ
[1:29:48] and bear The Life of Christ but there
[1:29:50] are fruits you shall know them
[1:29:52] that's why you scream
[1:29:54] that's why you respond to the word
[1:29:56] that's why you say amen that's why some
[1:29:58] of you catch the anointing and you run
[1:30:00] around or some of you dance you get
[1:30:01] excited you get emotional you tear and
[1:30:04] you cry it's because a life in the vine
[1:30:06] is being projected through your life
[1:30:11] but notice
[1:30:13] they don't want that
[1:30:16] can I give you some description of the
[1:30:17] modern Church
[1:30:19] this is what brother Brown says in the
[1:30:20] invisible Union of the bride of Christ
[1:30:21] let me a true picture of the modern
[1:30:24] church today neither does the modern
[1:30:26] Church want any of these here screaming
[1:30:30] shouting tongue speaking Acts 2 38
[1:30:34] youngers around her she don't want any
[1:30:36] of them whooping
[1:30:38] I like that whoop there it is
[1:30:42] she don't want that whooping carrying on
[1:30:44] screaming shouting oh hollering amen
[1:30:47] hallelujah such a child would
[1:30:49] immediately put her out of her
[1:30:50] denomination they had one like that in
[1:30:52] one of our churches they had Thor out
[1:30:53] right quick notice the evidence
[1:30:56] this was the modern Church didn't want
[1:31:00] this evidence in their church so if they
[1:31:02] didn't want this what is it it must be
[1:31:05] the evidence of the original life what
[1:31:07] is original life producing signs and
[1:31:10] wonders screaming whooping and hollering
[1:31:12] amen glory to God they believe in laying
[1:31:15] on hands they believe in healing the
[1:31:16] same they believe in the power of the
[1:31:18] Supernatural and yet the moderate Church
[1:31:21] don't want it
[1:31:27] they don't want that original life
[1:31:29] notice he says now the modern church is
[1:31:31] pregnated with something because she's
[1:31:33] bringing forth members all the time but
[1:31:36] she don't want none of them screaming
[1:31:38] hollering blabbering Acts 2 38 miserable
[1:31:41] creatures
[1:31:42] that she thinks they are
[1:31:45] it was certainly embarrass her
[1:31:47] well there's a lot of embarrassed
[1:31:49] pastors today
[1:31:50] a lot embarrassed churches around this
[1:31:51] message they don't want what we got
[1:31:54] let me just it ain't what we got it's
[1:31:55] what the word is
[1:31:57] they don't want it let me just say and
[1:31:59] don't ever Harden your heart and get so
[1:32:01] critical that you don't want this
[1:32:04] he says it was certainly embarrassing it
[1:32:06] would ruin her and her educated ethical
[1:32:09] scientific Society Church that she
[1:32:11] belonged to there they would throw her
[1:32:13] out at the next Council she can't have
[1:32:15] it she don't want to be pregnant with
[1:32:18] the word
[1:32:19] because that's the only kind that the
[1:32:22] word can bring forth
[1:32:25] oh did you hear what he said the only
[1:32:27] kind that the word in the beginning was
[1:32:29] the word the word was with God the Word
[1:32:31] was God and the Word was made flesh
[1:32:34] that's why you screamed that's why you
[1:32:36] shout that's why you dance that's why
[1:32:38] you respond to her because you are the
[1:32:40] word that's been made flesh in this hour
[1:32:44] oh but now that's so-called bride
[1:32:46] pregnant with all kind of tummy right
[1:32:47] disgrace and what is she doing oh she's
[1:32:49] bringing forth members all the time but
[1:32:51] she ain't bringing forth the word
[1:32:54] see born of the spirit of God it has to
[1:32:56] bring forth the spirit of God in it no
[1:32:58] intellectual Church John Creek going
[1:33:00] bobbed hair pain and Faith there's no
[1:33:02] such a thing as that in all of it you
[1:33:04] don't find that in the word of God you
[1:33:06] find notice what you find in the word of
[1:33:08] God in the original life
[1:33:10] you find an old-fashioned Sanctified
[1:33:13] holy ghost-filled child born of the
[1:33:16] spirit of God
[1:33:18] screaming
[1:33:21] oh did y'all hear that
[1:33:23] screaming hollering shouting praising
[1:33:28] God
[1:33:30] he didn't say nothing about being cold
[1:33:31] dead formal snoring in church falling
[1:33:34] asleep can't stay awake he said no what
[1:33:37] you find in that old
[1:33:38] old-fashioned church is old-fashioned
[1:33:41] Holy Ghost Field child born of the
[1:33:43] spirit of God screaming when they hear
[1:33:45] the word that's good hollering when they
[1:33:47] were hear the word that's good shouting
[1:33:48] when they hear the good word praising
[1:33:50] God because he's there and he's
[1:33:52] projecting their life he said she don't
[1:33:54] want it no indeedy what does she do then
[1:33:56] she brings all forth a pair of painted
[1:33:59] face short wearing Jezebel Society
[1:34:01] illegitimate cancer they called it oh he
[1:34:03] goes I think that's what it is look like
[1:34:05] a cat going on there
[1:34:07] but the word can only bring forth the
[1:34:10] word
[1:34:12] he says her sons are born out of her
[1:34:14] they rely on education school and some
[1:34:15] Bible schools so-called some great
[1:34:17] College that's supposed to be a long
[1:34:19] time ago hatching them out some sort of
[1:34:21] income Baker Style
[1:34:23] denominational Seekers religious came
[1:34:25] like just illegitimate to the word as
[1:34:27] Cain was just as illegitimate God never
[1:34:30] did recognize denomination he's always
[1:34:33] been against it his word is against it
[1:34:37] but if Christ is in the church musicians
[1:34:40] can come if Christ is in the church
[1:34:42] it will bear a christ-like spirit
[1:34:46] christ-like works christ-like faith if
[1:34:49] it's properly connected a good healthy
[1:34:53] Vine not cut off hanging down withering
[1:34:55] away but real good healthy Branch
[1:34:57] connected into the vine will bring forth
[1:35:00] the fruits of the spirit The Works that
[1:35:03] I do shall you do also see the true
[1:35:06] church
[1:35:07] the True Church of Jesus Christ the
[1:35:10] bride is like in a pure gold
[1:35:13] her righteousness is his righteousness
[1:35:16] her attributes are his own glorious
[1:35:19] attributes her identity is found in him
[1:35:21] what he is she is to reflect
[1:35:25] what he has she is to manifest there is
[1:35:28] no fault in her she is all glorious
[1:35:30] within and without from the beginning to
[1:35:32] the ending she is the work of her Lord
[1:35:34] and all his works are perfect
[1:35:37] in fact in her is summed up and
[1:35:40] manifested the Eternal wisdom and
[1:35:43] purpose of God in God's Eternal purpose
[1:35:46] was to bring forth a family
[1:35:49] to make Man In His Image
[1:35:51] and you are that word
[1:35:54] you are the fruit that is being made
[1:35:57] manifest today
[1:35:59] and the prophet of God will say there is
[1:36:01] no fault in you
[1:36:04] and if he doesn't find fault and you
[1:36:06] don't worry about all these naysayers
[1:36:08] don't worry about all these other ones
[1:36:10] finding fault in your jumping your joy
[1:36:12] and your Victory and everything of that
[1:36:14] and try to keep you suppressed and keep
[1:36:16] down and beat down notice what he says
[1:36:18] as I close and brother Timothy would
[1:36:20] come
[1:36:24] let me just get there brother Graham
[1:36:26] says in Christ the mystery God revealed
[1:36:28] we are his victory
[1:36:32] you and all your failures
[1:36:35] all your complexes all your mishaps all
[1:36:38] your mistakes
[1:36:39] you are his victory
[1:36:43] the church is his victory we come forth
[1:36:45] in this last days with this glorious
[1:36:48] gospel showing his victory he died for
[1:36:50] this purpose and we are the proof of his
[1:36:53] victory
[1:36:55] what do you mean the proof of his
[1:36:57] victory because it's his life
[1:37:00] that's now manifesting through you
[1:37:02] you young people the world's enticing
[1:37:05] you with everything it can throwing
[1:37:07] everything on the websites and
[1:37:08] billboards and everything else
[1:37:10] everything to gratify this flesh but
[1:37:13] your proof
[1:37:14] of his victory you're proof that this
[1:37:16] word Works your proof that the life that
[1:37:19] was deposited on the day of Pentecost is
[1:37:21] the very same life that's on display
[1:37:23] tonight
[1:37:24] the same power same word he says notice
[1:37:27] he died for that purpose and we are the
[1:37:29] proof of his victory when we see him
[1:37:31] coming down living among the church
[1:37:32] that's his victory shows that they
[1:37:35] couldn't keep him in the grave neither
[1:37:37] can they keep us that's right we're
[1:37:39] bound right we're already potentially a
[1:37:41] raise because we raised from the dead
[1:37:43] unbelief in the word from denominational
[1:37:46] creatures to the Eternal Word of an
[1:37:48] eternal God which is him himself working
[1:37:50] through US manifesting himself that he
[1:37:53] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:37:56] he said then the word moves on down into
[1:37:59] the body from the head what is it the
[1:38:02] same word nothing can be added to it or
[1:38:04] taken from it so the same word moves
[1:38:07] from the head as a date as a day comes
[1:38:10] to close down into the body down into
[1:38:12] the body vindicating that they are
[1:38:17] what he is
[1:38:19] you are to project
[1:38:22] [Music]
[1:38:24] same word same power same life same
[1:38:27] signs flesh of his flesh bone of his
[1:38:29] bone life of his life she is him
[1:38:34] and brother Brown will say the biggest
[1:38:36] problem that I find with the church
[1:38:37] today is they fail to recognize who they
[1:38:39] are
[1:38:41] I told you I was going to keep preaching
[1:38:43] you until you realize who you are
[1:38:45] you are the Vindication of his life
[1:38:50] you're the victory
[1:38:52] his sole purpose for going to Calvary
[1:38:54] and going down the hill and raising
[1:38:56] again was so that you could be here
[1:38:58] today so that you could be the evidence
[1:39:01] of his life would you buy your heads
[1:39:03] just for a minute
[1:39:09] as we bring this to a close
[1:39:11] maybe you've been struggling with
[1:39:13] questions maybe you've been struggling
[1:39:14] with who you are and maybe there's been
[1:39:17] a desire on the inside for something
[1:39:18] more I want you to know
[1:39:21] I want you to know tonight there's more
[1:39:23] for you
[1:39:24] there's a life that goes beyond Mama's
[1:39:27] life daddy's life preacher's life
[1:39:30] pastor's life there's a life
[1:39:33] your home may be destroyed right now
[1:39:36] Satan may have come in and try to divide
[1:39:38] the family and divide the home and bring
[1:39:40] in all kind of persecution
[1:39:42] but I want you to know he can't touch
[1:39:44] the life
[1:39:47] he can't touch the life that's in that
[1:39:50] seed
[1:39:53] had been beat down has been clubbed has
[1:39:55] been persecuted
[1:39:57] the leaves have been ate off of it life
[1:40:00] has been stripped out of it the fruit
[1:40:02] has been eat off of it
[1:40:04] but there's a word I will restore
[1:40:08] because there's predestinated fruit in
[1:40:10] the root
[1:40:10] and I'm looking at predestinated Sons
[1:40:12] and Daughters of God tonight
[1:40:16] if you've got a knee just slip your hand
[1:40:17] up say God I got a need I want to be
[1:40:19] exactly what this word is called me to
[1:40:21] be
[1:40:23] I want to be the very manifestation I
[1:40:25] want to be the evidence
[1:40:27] of that original life that you can take
[1:40:30] someone maybe from a broken home
[1:40:33] maybe who have been adopted and it seems
[1:40:35] like I was you know wasn't loved and
[1:40:38] wasn't cared for
[1:40:40] but God you have washed over that seed
[1:40:42] and put it in the right home in the
[1:40:44] right family to come in contact with
[1:40:46] this word
[1:40:50] if that's you till I just lift your hand
[1:40:51] before God and say God I need a touch
[1:40:53] from you today
[1:40:54] God sees your hands
[1:40:57] God sees your hand but more importantly
[1:40:58] God sees your heart
[1:41:01] father you see every hand that was
[1:41:02] lifted tonight Lord
[1:41:04] every heart every need behind the heart
[1:41:07] the hand that was lifted father we just
[1:41:09] believe that your word is the same Lord
[1:41:12] we don't have to look at you as a god of
[1:41:14] History
[1:41:16] that Lord you did something yesterday
[1:41:18] but yet you're not able to do it today
[1:41:20] Lord you did many mighty Miracles two
[1:41:24] thousand years ago Lord when you were in
[1:41:27] your human form and you walked on those
[1:41:28] Shores Lord and you heal blinded eyes
[1:41:31] and you raised from the dead and God you
[1:41:33] healed the cripples and you Lord you
[1:41:36] deliver the lepers you've done so many
[1:41:37] marvelous and mighty works
[1:41:39] and yet Lord 60 years ago there was a
[1:41:42] mighty move of God I went through our
[1:41:44] country and around the world through a
[1:41:46] prophet Ministry
[1:41:47] and Lord and you replicated the very
[1:41:49] same things that you've done in your own
[1:41:51] Ministry Lord you repeated it in the
[1:41:53] ministry of a prophet but God you didn't
[1:41:55] intend for those things to die with the
[1:41:58] prophet but God you intended to produce
[1:42:00] more Sons more Daughters of God that
[1:42:02] would take you at your word and have
[1:42:05] that same life living on the inside
[1:42:07] so when we come face to face with a
[1:42:09] demon and we have the authority through
[1:42:11] your word Lord to cast it out
[1:42:14] Lord that when we come and we lay hands
[1:42:16] on the sick we have the authority
[1:42:18] through your word father because we've
[1:42:19] seen it perform we see how the life
[1:42:22] responded before and we know how to act
[1:42:24] today and I just asked today God every
[1:42:27] hand that was lifted that you
[1:42:28] administered to the need
[1:42:30] he will speak to their Heart Lord
[1:42:32] he'll move on those that are here
[1:42:34] locally those on the archive father to
[1:42:36] strength may just have your way Lord in
[1:42:38] every heart and every life maybe they
[1:42:40] not be ashamed of the moving of the
[1:42:42] spirit
[1:42:43] when the rain begins to fall
[1:42:46] we have every reason to Rejoice however
[1:42:50] that is Lord whether it be tears of joy
[1:42:52] that stream off our faces
[1:42:55] whether it be emotion that maybe
[1:42:56] overtakes us God and we get excited and
[1:42:58] jump however whenever whoever God our
[1:43:03] desire is to let the Life of Christ
[1:43:05] be made manifest
[1:43:07] so we just Commit This service to you
