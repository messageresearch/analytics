[53:45] this time we're living in in Jesus name
[53:48] amen
[53:50] amen let's turn our Bibles First
[53:52] Corinthians 10. and verse 12 it's Amen
[53:56] good to be back home with you again and
[53:59] and uh as I said it's you know you enjoy
[54:02] going to other places and seeing other
[54:04] people but there's still no place like
[54:06] home
[54:07] and uh we're glad to be home and and
[54:10] glad to be able to be a service today I
[54:13] actually had a bit of a sometimers or
[54:16] Old-Timers moment
[54:18] um I was studying this out on first of
[54:22] last week up to about Wednesday about 2
[54:24] 30 and then I was actually my sister
[54:26] Lydia called me and she said are you
[54:28] preaching today I said what are you
[54:30] doing to some studying she said you're
[54:31] preaching today I said yes she said I
[54:33] thought brother Joe was preaching
[54:35] tonight
[54:36] I said well he sure is
[54:38] and so uh I went closed my stuff up went
[54:42] took a nap
[54:44] amen and so uh but anyway the Lord saw
[54:48] fit that we would speak it this morning
[54:49] and so amen he knows how to orchestrate
[54:52] things and and what to do it's all in
[54:55] his hands and his control and we're just
[54:57] glad to be a vessel used of him amen
[55:00] First Corinthians 10 and verse 12 says
[55:03] wherefore let him that thinketh he
[55:06] standeth take heed lest he fall
[55:09] there has no temptation taking you but
[55:12] such is common to man
[55:14] but God is faithful aren't you thankful
[55:17] he's faithful who will not suffer you to
[55:20] be tempted above that you're able but
[55:22] will with the Temptation also make a way
[55:25] of Escape that you may be able to Bear
[55:29] it amen we let you be seated this
[55:32] morning
[55:34] I'd like to speak to you on the late
[55:37] determined to fulfill
[55:40] amen I I believe we ought to be a people
[55:42] of determination
[55:44] because God is a god of determination
[55:47] and you know uh this determined means
[55:51] having reached a decision or firmly
[55:54] resolved it's synonyms for it is
[55:57] decisive it's purposeful it's Resolute
[56:00] it's resolved it's single-minded it's
[56:04] steadfast it's tenacious
[56:06] is decided firmed firm fixed persevering
[56:11] set settled buckled down
[56:14] constant Earnest meaning business solid
[56:18] strong-minded unfaltering unflinching
[56:21] unhesitating and unwavering I think
[56:25] that's some wonderful descriptions of
[56:27] Our Lord amen because I believe he is
[56:30] decided and he he doesn't change his
[56:33] decisions but what he has decided to
[56:35] amen about us he's going to continue on
[56:38] is not going to change and I I really
[56:40] appreciate a god like that because how
[56:43] difficult it would be to serve a God
[56:45] that you didn't know if one moment he
[56:47] loved you and the next moment he didn't
[56:49] or one moment he was his and the next
[56:51] moment you wasn't but if you were his
[56:53] before the foundation of the world you
[56:55] will always be his it doesn't matter
[56:58] what you're going through or what you're
[56:59] going the circumstances of life because
[57:02] he does not change it's what he said in
[57:04] his word he said I the Lord do not
[57:06] change therefore o children of Jacob are
[57:09] not consumed in other words if I change
[57:12] my mind about you amen you would not
[57:14] exist amen but I I I do not change my
[57:19] mind if I called you it says in the
[57:21] place God is not a man that he should
[57:23] lie or this or son of man or son of man
[57:26] that he should change his mind in other
[57:28] words he'd what he what is in his mind
[57:30] or what is in his thoughts is constant
[57:33] it it remains he's not double-minded
[57:35] amen he's single-minded and it says as
[57:39] the grass from another place says it's a
[57:40] grass wither and the flower Fades but
[57:42] the word of our God will stand forever
[57:45] in other places said oh of old you laid
[57:48] the foundations of the earth and the
[57:50] heavens are the work of your hands they
[57:52] will perish but you will remain they
[57:55] will all wear out like a garment you
[57:57] will change them like a robe and they
[57:59] will pass away but you are the same and
[58:03] your years have no end in other places
[58:05] it says heavens and Earth will pass away
[58:07] but my words will not pass away so God's
[58:11] word is firm it's a firm foundation it's
[58:14] a firm place you can stand upon and he
[58:16] has a determination to fulfill this word
[58:19] amen so he does not change his word
[58:22] according to the circumstances but he'll
[58:24] change the circumstances according to
[58:26] his word amen it says in Hebrews 13 and
[58:29] 8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[58:32] today and forever amen a few places
[58:34] brother Randall would say it like this
[58:35] he said God is determined and when God
[58:38] makes us up his mind to do anything it
[58:42] will be
[58:44] Hallelujah God is determined and when
[58:46] God makes up his mind to do anything it
[58:49] will be for God is determined that his
[58:52] table will be will be set and there will
[58:55] be somebody there God will have his
[58:57] table full amen God has never changed
[59:01] he's just the same today as he was he
[59:03] always been and God when God is
[59:05] determined to do something he will do it
[59:08] and nothing will stop him he will do it
[59:11] so this God does not what does not allow
[59:14] circumstances to change his mind this
[59:17] God does not allow pressures of the
[59:20] world or the things of this world to
[59:22] change his word or to change his mind
[59:24] God does not allow sin to change his
[59:26] word God does not allow the how great
[59:30] the sin gets and how bad it gets Amen to
[59:32] change his word but his word will remain
[59:35] the same no matter what the
[59:37] circumstances are no matter what the
[59:39] situation is amen no matter what the
[59:41] problem is no matter what's going on
[59:43] around him he's going to remain the same
[59:45] and I I believe as Believers if we are
[59:48] truly Born Again of the spirit of God we
[59:51] also have those attributes in US amen
[59:53] therefore we can have a determination we
[59:56] can have a stability about us we can
[59:58] have amen our settleness about us we can
[1:00:01] buckle down and press through the hard
[1:00:04] times of life and and be constant and
[1:00:07] and Earnest and mean business and
[1:00:09] strong-minded and also be unfaltering
[1:00:12] and also be unflinching and unhesitating
[1:00:15] and unwavering I believe that don't you
[1:00:18] if you have amen the seed of God on the
[1:00:21] inside of you then you also have his
[1:00:23] attributes
[1:00:25] and if God has the attributes of being
[1:00:28] unchanging we should also have the
[1:00:30] unwavering or whatever we should also
[1:00:33] have those same attributes inside of us
[1:00:36] amen he would say it like this in James
[1:00:38] 1 and verse 5. it says if any of you
[1:00:41] lack wisdom let him ask of God that
[1:00:44] giveth to all men liberally and
[1:00:46] unbraideth not and it shall be given him
[1:00:49] and let him ask in faith nothing
[1:00:52] wavering amen have faith not wavering
[1:00:55] not not deciding well he's not going to
[1:00:58] hear me he's not going to understand me
[1:01:00] you know many times we talk ourselves
[1:01:02] out of it before God's even gave the
[1:01:04] answer amen many times we've talked
[1:01:06] ourselves out of it amen before God has
[1:01:09] been given the chance to come on the
[1:01:11] scene and move on our behalf amen it's
[1:01:14] just like the man one time I heard the
[1:01:16] story of a man who had to blow out and
[1:01:18] he was out in the middle of nowhere and
[1:01:20] he sees one little light up there you
[1:01:22] know on the hill and you probably heard
[1:01:23] the story see one little light on the
[1:01:25] hill an old farmer out there and he he
[1:01:27] said well maybe I don't have a jack I
[1:01:29] don't have a tire tool I don't have
[1:01:30] nothing maybe he can help me but it's
[1:01:32] midnight and he he said but maybe he
[1:01:34] won't care and he starts walking up
[1:01:36] there but his mind began to do battles
[1:01:38] with him and he's like man this man is
[1:01:40] going to be upset he's going to be mad
[1:01:42] he's going to be mad I woke him up he's
[1:01:44] going to be mad because he didn't get no
[1:01:46] sleep he'd been out there doing this and
[1:01:48] doing that got the bed late going to get
[1:01:50] up early and he's probably gonna pull a
[1:01:52] gun he's probably going to and four and
[1:01:54] what boy got up there he almost had
[1:01:55] talked himself out of it but his mind
[1:01:58] just kept saying kept pushing in this
[1:02:00] way and he gets up and actually goes and
[1:02:02] knocks on the door but he's done talked
[1:02:04] himself into the place to where this man
[1:02:06] has going to be mad at him and he's
[1:02:09] going to tell him no and and he's going
[1:02:10] to he's going to rebuke him and he then
[1:02:13] the man the farmer gets out of his bed
[1:02:15] he comes answers the door and the man
[1:02:17] says keep your old Jack anyhow
[1:02:21] amen why because he was unstable he he
[1:02:25] done talked himself into a situation and
[1:02:28] the man didn't even have a chance to
[1:02:30] help him without him already being
[1:02:32] talked out of it many times we come to
[1:02:34] God the same way amen before we can give
[1:02:37] Before the Throne of God we begin to
[1:02:40] flavor in our faith when we begin to
[1:02:42] waver and say well God doesn't love me
[1:02:44] God doesn't care about me God doesn't
[1:02:46] understand what I'm going through and
[1:02:48] he's not going to he's got he's too busy
[1:02:50] for me he's got this going on just keep
[1:02:52] your own promises anyhow listen we got
[1:02:55] to have faith and without wavering amen
[1:02:58] we got to have faith to walk up to the
[1:03:01] door and knock and keep on knocking that
[1:03:04] God's going to answer me that God will
[1:03:06] not change his love towards me that I am
[1:03:09] his son and he won't deny himself and
[1:03:12] God's going to answer what I have need
[1:03:14] of
[1:03:16] amen I ask him in faith nothing wavering
[1:03:19] for he that is waver he that waverth is
[1:03:23] like a wave of the sea driven with the
[1:03:26] wind and tossed for let not that man
[1:03:28] think that he shall receive anything of
[1:03:31] the Lord a double-minded man is unstable
[1:03:34] in all his ways so it's not just in the
[1:03:37] way of the law of truth but it's also
[1:03:40] unstable in every part of your life
[1:03:42] you're unstable in what you do in your
[1:03:45] work you're unstable in how you operate
[1:03:46] in your family you're under unstable in
[1:03:49] every part and it starts with faith
[1:03:53] amen James writing of the double the
[1:03:55] doubting person is he that's like a wave
[1:03:58] of the sea and is blown and tossed by
[1:04:01] the wind that man should think he should
[1:04:04] that man should not think he will
[1:04:05] receive anything from the Lord because
[1:04:08] he's a double-minded man unstable in all
[1:04:11] that he does he says a doubter is a
[1:04:13] double-minded person Jesus had in mind
[1:04:16] such a person when he spoke of one who
[1:04:18] tries to serve two masters therefore he
[1:04:21] is unstable one day he's wanting to
[1:04:23] serve this one the next day he's wanting
[1:04:24] to serve that one he's unsteady he's
[1:04:27] wavering in both his character and
[1:04:29] feelings amen a double-minded person is
[1:04:32] restless and Confused in his thoughts
[1:04:34] and his actions and his behavior such a
[1:04:37] person is always in conflict with
[1:04:39] himself
[1:04:42] amen one torn by such inner conflict can
[1:04:46] never lean with confidence on God and
[1:04:48] His gracious promise amen the term
[1:04:51] unstable is as a drunken man unable to
[1:04:54] walk a straight line
[1:04:56] he is so defined that he he is no
[1:05:00] defined Direction and as a result he
[1:05:02] never gets anywhere such a person is
[1:05:06] unstable in all that he does
[1:05:09] this is what Jesus would talk about a
[1:05:11] double-minded man he said in Luke
[1:05:13] chapter 9 and verse 57 said it came to
[1:05:16] pass that as they went though in the way
[1:05:18] a certain man said unto him Lord I will
[1:05:21] follow thee weather thy goeth and Jesus
[1:05:23] said on him foxes have holes birds have
[1:05:26] air that have out there have nests but
[1:05:29] the son of man hath not where to lay his
[1:05:31] head and he said to another follow me
[1:05:33] but he said Lord suffer me first to go
[1:05:35] and bury my father and he said let the
[1:05:38] dead bury their dead but go down and
[1:05:40] preach the kingdom of God and another
[1:05:42] said Lord I will follow thee but let me
[1:05:44] go bid them farewell which are at my
[1:05:46] home at the house and Jesus said unto
[1:05:49] them no man having put his hand to the
[1:05:52] plow looking back is fit for the kingdom
[1:05:55] of God Amen so when you put your hand to
[1:05:58] the gospel you never look back
[1:06:01] amen it doesn't matter if this one goes
[1:06:03] with you or that one goes with you or
[1:06:05] families walk away or this or that and
[1:06:07] the other my mind is set on Jesus Christ
[1:06:10] my mind is set upon his promises and I
[1:06:14] will fulfill the word that is spoke
[1:06:16] about me I will fulfill what God has
[1:06:20] ordained me to fulfill in this hour
[1:06:25] well the brand I'm going to say it like
[1:06:27] this he said if you have if you need any
[1:06:29] need whatsoever that God is Promised in
[1:06:31] his Bible he's here tonight to meet that
[1:06:34] need no need seeking further his
[1:06:36] presence is here his spirit is here and
[1:06:39] he's willing now
[1:06:41] Hallelujah and ready and longing to give
[1:06:44] you what you've been seeking for but
[1:06:46] when you come to him don't come as a
[1:06:49] floater
[1:06:51] don't come as a floater and I you know I
[1:06:55] go up there and try it and see if it
[1:06:56] works you'll never get nowhere
[1:06:59] he said when you come come with this
[1:07:02] kind of determination
[1:07:05] this kind of determination that you have
[1:07:08] sold out locked Stock and Barrel and
[1:07:11] when you you're tired of the world the
[1:07:13] sin and unbelief and frustration and
[1:07:15] doubt and you're coming to a living God
[1:07:18] with an anchor surely tied to the Rock
[1:07:20] of Ages and the Holy Spirit is here to
[1:07:23] pull you into the presence of the Living
[1:07:25] God that will give you a faith that'll
[1:07:27] overcome anything ever sickness ever
[1:07:30] disease and even death itself
[1:07:34] if you'll come with that kind of
[1:07:36] determination
[1:07:39] not just floating around and floating up
[1:07:42] here and now come with a determination
[1:07:44] that tonight this is going to end today
[1:07:47] this is going to be the finish at this
[1:07:50] moment I'm going to receive something
[1:07:51] from God Amen he said another place he
[1:07:53] said they have never found a better way
[1:07:55] for a baby to get what it wants and cry
[1:07:58] for it
[1:07:59] he said if you give them a bail and say
[1:08:01] junior you're only three days old but
[1:08:03] now when when you want it when you want
[1:08:05] your bottle raise up this Bell and ring
[1:08:07] it see if it works it won't work a baby
[1:08:10] cries for what he wants that's God's
[1:08:13] provided way amen he said don't whip the
[1:08:16] little fella he's only following God's
[1:08:18] provided way he wants something that's
[1:08:20] right it's the only way he knows how to
[1:08:23] call his mother scream for it and cry
[1:08:25] for it he said God recommends this for
[1:08:29] his children
[1:08:31] how many children we got here in the
[1:08:33] building this God recommends us for his
[1:08:36] believing children
[1:08:38] he did not intellectual speeches not
[1:08:40] some great theology amen he wants you to
[1:08:43] cry out for your need that's right cry
[1:08:45] out but if you're too stiff and start
[1:08:47] you you'll never get it if you're ready
[1:08:49] to limber yourself up a little bit and
[1:08:52] cry out gotta give it to you he likes to
[1:08:55] hear his children cry cry your needs
[1:08:58] unto God God wants it that's his
[1:09:00] provided way amen that's the way he
[1:09:03] wants you to cry cry how long how long
[1:09:05] does a baby cry
[1:09:08] until he gets what he wants
[1:09:11] until he gets satisfied he said that's
[1:09:14] the way of believing Christians should
[1:09:16] do God's child if you see God made a
[1:09:19] promise don't give up on it cry until
[1:09:22] it's answered
[1:09:23] Hallelujah cry to you see God Vindicated
[1:09:27] his word and prove it right here you
[1:09:29] don't have to cry no more you got it

[1:09:33] that scream out till you get it

[1:09:37] scream out to get it you said you know
[1:09:39] he said but you got to be persistent
[1:09:41] about it he said not a hybrid plant not
[1:09:44] one that has to be babied and petted and
[1:09:46] packed around Christians are real
[1:09:48] genuine born articles of God they fight
[1:09:51] for their position

[1:09:59] finished on this Earth every move of
[1:10:01] theirs is a fight

[1:12:18] with that determination that I'm going
[1:12:21] to get something from God then we
[1:12:22] wouldn't worry about all the other
[1:12:24] nonsense around us we wouldn't worry
[1:12:26] about all the other stuff going on
[1:12:28] around us but we'll say God I got to

[1:12:43] and you're ready to push through all the
[1:12:45] doubts and all the worry and all the
[1:12:48] discouragement and all the problems
[1:12:50] around you
[1:12:51] well you said well I got a lot of
[1:12:53] disappointments well God lets
[1:12:55] disappointments happen
[1:13:01] direct quote
[1:13:04] God lets disappointments happen to show
[1:13:08] victory
[1:13:11] Hallelujah if you could only see that if
[1:13:15] you could only see these things that
[1:13:17] seem to be burning you and upsetting you
[1:13:20] and trials that are going on they are
[1:13:22] things to stand still and focus your
[1:13:25] glasses on the word of God and speak the
[1:13:28] word of God and just walk forward that's
[1:13:31] all there is to do
[1:13:39] he says
[1:13:42] he said you believe that these things be
[1:13:44] of God well it depends on what you think
[1:13:46] what you think about it if you believe
[1:13:48] it to be the Lord Jesus what he said he
[1:13:50] would do the same things that I do you
[1:13:52] say he did that sure and look he looked
[1:13:55] into this audience perceiving their
[1:13:56] thoughts told them different things is
[1:13:58] that right the Scripture it read that it
[1:14:00] reads that way in the Blessed Bible that
[1:14:02] we know that our lord Jesus is raised
[1:14:04] from the dead and he visited his people
[1:14:06] and called the Gentiles out just before
[1:14:08] he calls the Jews and rejects the
[1:14:10] Gentile church that were they were under
[1:14:12] inspiration flee that that was the
[1:14:15] inspiration Fleet of Christ as quick as
[1:14:17] you can don't be double-minded
[1:14:22] amen he says another place he said after
[1:14:24] death Faith sees the resurrection a god
[1:14:27] of Resurrection That's The Power of
[1:14:29] Faith to believe he said when he's
[1:14:31] standing over there behind the Dark
[1:14:33] Cloud that you can't see with your
[1:14:34] natural eyes but Faith he and he said
[1:14:37] let me back up he said he is standing
[1:14:39] over there behind that dark cloud that
[1:14:41] you can't see with your natural eyes but
[1:14:44] Faith standing by right by you directs
[1:14:47] you to him
[1:14:49] hello
[1:14:50] amen the God of all wisdom who is
[1:14:53] ordained your path he's standing just
[1:14:56] behind every trial
[1:14:59] yeah
[1:15:00] to know that Peter said that every trial
[1:15:03] is worth more to us than gold for its
[1:15:05] working every son that comes to God must
[1:15:08] first be tried and scores and chastised
[1:15:10] and if you'll get a little heartache
[1:15:12] after you get born again a little trial
[1:15:14] that upset you somewhere and you run
[1:15:16] back to the world again it shows you
[1:15:18] wouldn't a child to begin with and you
[1:15:20] become an illegitimate child and not a
[1:15:22] child of God he said but if a man once
[1:15:24] anchors his heart in the heart of
[1:15:26] Calvary all devil is in hell will never
[1:15:29] Shake him out of it no more he's there
[1:15:33] he's there for amen for he that cannot
[1:15:36] stand chastise me he's an illegitimate
[1:15:38] child he claims God to be his father
[1:15:40] when he's not just tossed about by ever
[1:15:43] when the doctor not stable don't know
[1:15:45] where you're going double-minded and a
[1:15:47] lot of times double tongued
[1:15:52] and don't know where you're standing or
[1:15:54] what you're talking about then a man
[1:15:56] that's born the spirit of God knows
[1:15:58] exactly where he's at nothing phases him
[1:16:02] because something inside of him has
[1:16:05] already witnessed somebody is just on
[1:16:07] the other side of that cloud
[1:16:10] Hallelujah somebody is on the other side
[1:16:13] of that cloud so you know whether
[1:16:15] Brandon would preach perseverance
[1:16:18] preaching a lot of places
[1:16:20] many different ways many different times
[1:16:22] referred to it some some in different
[1:16:24] places
[1:16:26] he said I love this word perseverant
[1:16:28] he said it means to be persistent in
[1:16:31] making a goal
[1:16:35] yeah
[1:16:36] and there's only one goal we're really
[1:16:38] truly worried about as a Christian
[1:16:40] that's the rapture
[1:16:42] that's Eternal things and eternal things
[1:16:45] of Eternal benefits he said but to be
[1:16:48] this you must be fully persuaded
[1:16:51] and persistent and then you can be
[1:16:53] perseverant he said I think that's the
[1:16:57] attitude that all Christians should be
[1:16:59] in at all times
[1:17:03] yep got my heart burnt too
[1:17:07] amen I think that's the attitude that
[1:17:10] all Christians should be in at all times
[1:17:12] be perseverant a man through all ages
[1:17:17] that has faith in what they're trying to
[1:17:18] achieve has always been perseverant
[1:17:22] electric electricity is here because a
[1:17:25] man was persevered
[1:17:27] Carr you
[1:17:28] jump it's here because a man
[1:17:30] 's a variant
[1:17:34] think about anymore in your daily life
[1:17:35] is here upon this Earth because somebody
[1:17:38] was perseverant they tried this and it
[1:17:41] wouldn't work they tried that and it
[1:17:42] wouldn't work and try this over here and
[1:17:44] it wouldn't work but finally they found
[1:17:46] something that would work
[1:17:48] amen you fly an airplane because
[1:17:50] somebody was perseverant it was somebody
[1:17:53] bold enough to say hey I believe as we
[1:17:56] watch those birds man can do that also
[1:17:58] and so they tried this and it would
[1:18:00] crash they'd try that and it would crash
[1:18:02] and they finally tried something it
[1:18:04] would die for a little while and they
[1:18:05] would Tinker with this and Tinker with
[1:18:07] that why because they were perseverance
[1:18:11] so now today you're in getting a tube
[1:18:13] and go all over the Earth in just a few
[1:18:15] moments what used to take months
[1:18:18] and sometimes even over almost years to
[1:18:22] get over to the other side at one point
[1:18:23] was never thought thinkable it was never
[1:18:25] even thought of
[1:18:28] but now this Earth is so small because
[1:18:31] man and their perseverance has found
[1:18:34] ways to make it smaller
[1:18:36] you know it's amazing I I I'm sorry I I
[1:18:39] live in this age and I still get amazed
[1:18:40] that I can pick up my phone and even
[1:18:42] talk to my daughter and just down in
[1:18:45] Florida
[1:18:45] and I can see your face and she can see
[1:18:48] mine and we can have a conversation or
[1:18:50] you can do that anywhere around the
[1:18:51] world it's incredible
[1:18:53] but it was because somebody was
[1:18:55] perseverant it was because somebody amen
[1:18:58] had the faith to believe it was possible
[1:19:02] there was somebody that had that had the
[1:19:04] faith to believe that we can have
[1:19:06] electricity we don't have to have a
[1:19:08] candle all the time and just light it by
[1:19:10] fire a little dim light no we can have
[1:19:12] better in that so somebody had the faith
[1:19:15] to believe in that Faith gave them a
[1:19:18] persistence to continue until they found
[1:19:21] what they were looking for
[1:19:24] Hallelujah he said if you can be
[1:19:27] persevering and have faith in what
[1:19:29] you're trying to achieve you will
[1:19:31] achieve it
[1:19:33] you got the first have faith before you
[1:19:36] can be perseverance so faith and
[1:19:38] perseverance Works hand in hand together
[1:19:41] they are brothers
[1:19:45] you know I was going to say this to the
[1:19:47] end but I I believe right now because I
[1:19:49] just seeing what he said right there
[1:19:51] this whole start this whole thing
[1:19:53] started because Sunday night me and
[1:19:55] sister Ruth and sister Katie and sister
[1:19:57] Rebecca that was with us would travel
[1:19:59] part way home and I'd in a motel and I
[1:20:02] was studying for Wednesday night
[1:20:05] and somebody I don't even know who it
[1:20:07] was I don't I don't even think I know
[1:20:09] just some random email sent me some
[1:20:12] group sent me this email and I just I
[1:20:14] don't know I normally I just hit delete
[1:20:16] and send them to the delete file but I
[1:20:18] got to reading it
[1:20:20] faith
[1:20:24] Works hand in hand
[1:20:26] with persistence
[1:20:29] but you got to have faith to be
[1:20:31] persistent
[1:20:33] amen
[1:20:34] so the God would have to give us
[1:20:36] something to have faith so we can be
[1:20:38] persistent
[1:20:40] so he had placed in his word and he'd
[1:20:42] show his word does not change so
[1:20:44] therefore we have a firm foundation that
[1:20:47] we can stand upon as we just read the
[1:20:49] word the word said he will not put more
[1:20:51] on you than which you can bear but he
[1:20:53] will make a way of Escape so when you're
[1:20:55] going through a trial that word gives
[1:20:57] you the persistence to take another step
[1:21:00] to keep going because you know at any
[1:21:02] moment there's a way of Escape
[1:21:05] [Applause]
[1:21:07] you know at any moment the door is going
[1:21:09] to open and God's going to change the
[1:21:11] season that you're in God's going to
[1:21:13] change the moment that you're going
[1:21:15] through but this this right here was
[1:21:16] just I sent a joke though me and about I
[1:21:19] want to tear the motel room apart but
[1:21:20] during a study a heart in Harvard
[1:21:23] Harvard University in the 1950s Dr Kurt
[1:21:26] Richard placed rats in a pool of water
[1:21:28] to test how long they could tread water
[1:21:31] on average they'd give up and sink after
[1:21:34] 15 minutes but right before they gave up
[1:21:37] due to exhaustion he would pluck them
[1:21:40] out the researchers would pluck them out
[1:21:42] dry them off let them rest for a few
[1:21:45] minutes and put them back in the water
[1:21:46] for a second try on the second try how
[1:21:49] long you think they lasted any guesses
[1:21:52] some of y'all told the story so I don't
[1:21:54] want to know y'all guess
[1:21:56] I mean how long do you think they might
[1:21:57] have last William how long
[1:21:59] 10 15 minutes a good guess that's what
[1:22:02] he said how long do you think 15 minutes
[1:22:04] 10 minutes five minutes no
[1:22:08] 60 hours
[1:22:12] yeah that's not an error that's right 60
[1:22:16] hours of swimming and the conclusion
[1:22:19] drawn from this study at Harvard
[1:22:22] amen was sin as it was now this clear
[1:22:26] this conclusion drawn was that since the
[1:22:29] rats believed
[1:22:31] they would eventually be rescued they
[1:22:34] pushed their bodies way past what they
[1:22:36] previously thought possible
[1:22:40] and he said I want to leave you with
[1:22:42] this thought if hope can cause exhausted
[1:22:46] rats
[1:22:48] to swim long and then why he said what
[1:22:51] could faith give to a son of God
[1:22:55] to realize before you go down God's
[1:22:58] going to pull you out
[1:23:03] Hallelujah before you go down and defeat
[1:23:07] brother Johnny God's gonna pull you out
[1:23:09] before you go down God's going to make a
[1:23:12] way of Escape I thought oh God if God if
[1:23:15] God could place something on the inside
[1:23:17] of a rat to believe in a Fickle human
[1:23:19] being was going to reach down in time to
[1:23:22] pick them up how much more so the Church
[1:23:24] of the Living God will live we're going
[1:23:26] to press to the mark of the High Calling
[1:23:29] amen why because before we can go down
[1:23:32] and defeat God's going to snatch us out
[1:23:35] [Applause]
[1:23:37] but this church will not fail
[1:23:45] remember who you are
[1:23:47] and why you're here
[1:23:49] keep swimming
[1:23:56] amen
[1:23:58] well I hope you got the faith of a rat
[1:24:04] Mercy
[1:24:05] we think faith is some big thing off
[1:24:07] there a rat can obtain it
[1:24:12] did it not done I'll just read it to you
[1:24:14] a belief
[1:24:16] that if I just continue somebody's gonna
[1:24:19] pull me out again
[1:24:22] what a what a God we serve what a great
[1:24:26] God we serve
[1:24:27] amen so that's why we have a
[1:24:29] determination about us because we have a
[1:24:31] word that has ignited our faith
[1:24:36] we have events through scripture that we
[1:24:38] have watched and we have witnessed amen
[1:24:40] that God's not it's not just a book of
[1:24:42] history or a book of the past or you
[1:24:44] know Moses is not just somebody in the
[1:24:46] history and somebody in the past but
[1:24:48] that same God is still doing things
[1:24:50] today as he did Moses Joshua Caleb all
[1:24:53] those down through there and we watch
[1:24:55] God moving a very wonderful way he would
[1:24:59] allow them to get down to a red sea and
[1:25:01] then he would snatch them out
[1:25:04] come on now amen then we would watch as
[1:25:07] they would go through a desert he let
[1:25:09] him get to a bitter Waters then he would
[1:25:10] snatch him out of that situation he
[1:25:12] would let him get down to no water no
[1:25:14] food he'd snatch him out he let him get
[1:25:16] to the Jordan River where there was no
[1:25:18] way to cross and he would make a way of
[1:25:20] Escape snatch them out amen us and we
[1:25:24] have if we have truly placed our faith
[1:25:27] in that word then we know the same God
[1:25:29] that moved on their behalf it's also the
[1:25:31] same God that'll move on our behalf he's
[1:25:34] the same one that is pulling us out of
[1:25:36] our situation and out of our struggles
[1:25:38] and out of our torment out of our mind
[1:25:41] battles out of our Pro come on somebody
[1:25:44] amen out of our sicknesses out of cancer
[1:25:47] out of every kind of unclean Spirit it
[1:25:49] is God that is snatching us out
[1:25:52] and the devil thinks he's got you
[1:25:54] surrounded and he thinks you got your
[1:25:56] last moment I have I ain't got my last
[1:25:59] moment I got my moment to go through my
[1:26:01] door of Escape
[1:26:03] and listen this Rapture is going to come
[1:26:05] down to that
[1:26:07] it's like a trap
[1:26:11] it's a snatching away it comes as a
[1:26:14] thief in the night
[1:26:17] well we've heard it before I don't
[1:26:19] believe a thief comes up to your picture
[1:26:20] window grabs a rock and chunks it
[1:26:22] through in the middle of the night said
[1:26:23] hey I'm a thief
[1:26:26] I'm coming to take what's yours
[1:26:29] no no he comes and gone you don't even
[1:26:31] know it
[1:26:33] it's what his ambition is anyway to come
[1:26:35] and get what he wants and leave and you
[1:26:37] don't even know it to sometimes months
[1:26:39] later or weeks later or a year later you
[1:26:41] go check a drawer and hey that money you
[1:26:43] put there is gone or this is gone you
[1:26:45] realize hey I've been robbed this is
[1:26:48] what he's going to do with the rapture
[1:26:50] that's why he's allowed the waters to
[1:26:53] get so rough
[1:26:55] come on now he's allow things to go the
[1:26:59] what we would think impossible and what
[1:27:01] we would think unconseen conceivable and
[1:27:03] halfway he was in control we wouldn't do
[1:27:05] it this way but God is in control and
[1:27:08] God knows the end from the beginning
[1:27:10] therefore he allows things to get to
[1:27:12] where they're at and the conditions to
[1:27:14] be where they're at you know what your
[1:27:16] job is to do keep swimming
[1:27:19] keep pushing keep pressing keep going
[1:27:21] forward because God is going to make a
[1:27:24] wave Escape
[1:27:25] God's going to snatch his bride off the
[1:27:28] face of the earth and the world won't
[1:27:30] know nothing about it
[1:27:35] so it has to put a perseverance in US
[1:27:39] to have that you've got to have faith of
[1:27:41] in what you're trying to achieve you've
[1:27:44] got to have faith amen before you can be
[1:27:47] perseverance so faith and perseverance
[1:27:49] Works hand in hand together they're
[1:27:51] Brothers You Must Believe or you won't
[1:27:54] have no confidence
[1:27:57] amen if you lose confidence in a
[1:27:59] preacher you're not going to hear what
[1:28:01] he says
[1:28:02] I don't care who you are if you lose
[1:28:04] confidence in each other you're not
[1:28:05] going to want to know what they say
[1:28:07] you won't you know and then when you're
[1:28:09] looking to talk about the word now if
[1:28:11] you have no confidence you don't know
[1:28:13] you won't know whether you're right or
[1:28:14] whether you're wrong
[1:28:17] this is why we see these people that's
[1:28:18] that's lost their confidence in a profit
[1:28:21] and now lost their confidence in the
[1:28:22] Bible they don't know whether what's
[1:28:24] right and what's wrong
[1:28:26] they've lost it they're bearings they
[1:28:28] they're they're double-minded
[1:28:31] because believe me it ain't left them
[1:28:34] the Bible says train up a child in the
[1:28:37] way they're going it'll never leave them
[1:28:38] it ain't left them there's moments in
[1:28:41] their life as this Maniac could gather
[1:28:43] would come to himself and say Lord I
[1:28:45] need help and that cry would bring the
[1:28:48] master across the sea amen what was it
[1:28:50] he was something on him that how he was
[1:28:52] raised what he went through he knew that
[1:28:54] there was had to be a Deliverance for
[1:28:56] him and knew there had to be something
[1:28:58] that God could move so listen those out
[1:29:01] there in the world those that have
[1:29:02] walked away those that are saying
[1:29:03] whether they want to they may have
[1:29:05] blasphemed God they may not be no hope
[1:29:07] for them but it ain't left them
[1:29:11] amen that's what's causing the torment
[1:29:13] that's over their life amen because why
[1:29:16] it places something but when they lose
[1:29:18] their confidence then they don't know
[1:29:20] what's right or what's wrong when you
[1:29:21] have but when you have reached a place
[1:29:23] that you have faith in what you're doing
[1:29:26] then you can be perseverant
[1:29:30] so that's why Satan is always trying to
[1:29:33] break the confidence of the ministry
[1:29:38] come on now that's exactly what he's
[1:29:40] trying to do whether it be the prophet
[1:29:42] whether it be the father listen when
[1:29:43] brother Brandon was here what did he
[1:29:44] have to constantly hammer on God still
[1:29:47] uses Prophets
[1:29:49] that was a lot of a lot of times you'd
[1:29:51] hear him don't you believe God still
[1:29:53] uses prophets don't you God's not still
[1:29:55] uses it he does nothing until he reveal
[1:29:58] it to a service of prophets and then we
[1:29:59] get to our day what do we got to do God
[1:30:02] still uses 5-4 Ministry
[1:30:04] Satan is always trying to and to deter
[1:30:08] or to break down the confidence that God
[1:30:11] wants you to have
[1:30:17] as we heard brother Aaron the other
[1:30:18] night
[1:30:20] speak on the uh the church age book and
[1:30:23] the Nicolaitans spirit
[1:30:25] and he talked about Ministries that's
[1:30:27] built on negativity
[1:30:30] you know and
[1:30:31] as he was he went down he's not even
[1:30:34] just talking about preachers he's
[1:30:35] talking about individuals that your
[1:30:37] whole concept the whole thing is about
[1:30:39] negativity everything's negative
[1:30:45] and he talked go listen to us a
[1:30:47] wonderful it's in the church age book
[1:30:50] and he and he says you know he says you
[1:30:52] know what way he says if it calls you're
[1:30:54] you're you you think you're right and
[1:30:56] other people agree you're right don't
[1:30:58] mean you're right
[1:31:00] Satan deceived two-thirds or third of
[1:31:02] the Angels
[1:31:04] amen preaching the preaching and
[1:31:06] thinking he was right listen that's why
[1:31:08] we have to bring our confidence back to
[1:31:10] what the word says it ain't what I say
[1:31:13] or what anybody else says if the
[1:31:15] preacher is not preaching the word then
[1:31:16] they don't have you don't have to have
[1:31:18] confidence in it but if he's speaking
[1:31:20] what the word says then if you don't
[1:31:22] have confidence you ain't just lost
[1:31:23] confidence in the ministry you've lost
[1:31:25] it in the word of God
[1:31:28] and this is where Satan is trying to to
[1:31:31] deteriorate and to pull that and to make
[1:31:33] it to where hey that's just brother
[1:31:35] Timothy that's just brother Tim that's
[1:31:37] their own ideas that's just brother
[1:31:39] Branham he had all kind of ideas
[1:31:42] they're old they're old
[1:31:44] fogy ideas anyhow who wants to believe
[1:31:47] that anymore
[1:31:48] I am God and I change not
[1:31:53] God's word does not change with the
[1:31:56] decree the the the
[1:31:57] degree of sin
[1:32:01] you get what I'm saying just because sin
[1:32:04] is worse does not mean God just moves
[1:32:06] over a little bit and says you know what
[1:32:08] well it used to be wrong to do this but
[1:32:10] now it's not
[1:32:11] you see what I'm saying no God stays
[1:32:14] there he wants somewhere you can put
[1:32:15] your confidence on he said I was
[1:32:17] thinking about the history of our nation
[1:32:18] and a handful of soldiers on a cold
[1:32:21] winter day and odds all against them
[1:32:23] American soldiers
[1:32:25] he said when I read it it made me want
[1:32:27] to cry in my in my heart but their
[1:32:29] leader was a Christian George Washington
[1:32:31] the Delaware was froze over ice gorgeous
[1:32:33] in it and I understand about half the
[1:32:35] American soldiers didn't even have so
[1:32:37] shoes on their feet stuff just stuff
[1:32:39] wrapped around their feet them old they
[1:32:41] were the American soldiers obstacles was
[1:32:43] great the odds was against them but yet
[1:32:45] after prayer all night until he's wet up
[1:32:49] to his hips and snow where he knelt and
[1:32:51] prayed their great leader became
[1:32:53] perseverance for he had assurance that
[1:32:56] God was with him and he crossed to
[1:32:59] Delaware anywhere he was persevering
[1:33:01] although bullet holes went through his
[1:33:03] clothes he heard from God and no matter
[1:33:06] what the odds was he was going to
[1:33:08] continue the course
[1:33:11] amen he was persevering he had heard
[1:33:13] from God and he believed what God Said
[1:33:16] therefore it didn't matter if the river
[1:33:18] the river was frozen or the ice was
[1:33:20] breaking would break the boats it didn't
[1:33:22] matter what the obstacles was it
[1:33:25] mattered I'm going to stay the course
[1:33:27] because I have heard from God and God is
[1:33:30] with me
[1:33:32] come on bride of Jesus Christ we're not
[1:33:34] here to try to take another Nation we're
[1:33:36] not here to try to try to establish a
[1:33:38] nation that's not why we're here but we
[1:33:41] have heard from God
[1:33:43] and it doesn't matter how icy the river
[1:33:45] is or how danger it is or how bad it is
[1:33:48] amen God we've heard from God in this
[1:33:50] message and he said I am with you
[1:33:56] and I'll never leave you or forsake you
[1:34:04] Noah had to have that same perseverance
[1:34:07] I went and I told this before but I went
[1:34:10] and visited that boat and Noah built
[1:34:12] that one that replicated if it's
[1:34:14] anywhere close to what they built
[1:34:17] I'm glad I wasn't chosen to be Noah
[1:34:22] it took a special man for that
[1:34:26] I mean 120 years nailing nails and
[1:34:29] cutting logs and says hey what happened
[1:34:31] he had heard from God
[1:34:33] said no I found Grace in the eyes of the
[1:34:35] Lord
[1:34:37] Hallelujah in the middle of all that
[1:34:39] wickedness in the middle of all that
[1:34:41] nonsense around there Noah found Grace
[1:34:43] in the eyes of God and he was given a
[1:34:46] vision and he was told how to build it
[1:34:48] what to do you know all the rooms of it
[1:34:50] how many levels how length I mean
[1:34:52] detailed
[1:34:55] because God knew what it was going to
[1:34:57] take to get across the flood he knew
[1:34:59] that there was no other boat was going
[1:35:01] to be able to stand to stand the storms
[1:35:03] that were coming
[1:35:05] come on now I don't know is a type of
[1:35:08] the tribulation Saints the ending said
[1:35:10] also but these are also doing beings and
[1:35:12] dual purposes because brother Branham
[1:35:14] used it as the ark being the Ark of
[1:35:16] Safety and the Ark of the Covenant
[1:35:18] bringing it on down listen God knows
[1:35:20] exactly what it's going to take to go
[1:35:22] through every storm
[1:35:24] God knows exactly how to build this ship
[1:35:27] of Zion
[1:35:29] he knows exactly she goes how whatever
[1:35:32] wave is going to come and how bad it's
[1:35:34] going to be and how hard it's going to
[1:35:36] be and how difficult it's going to be he
[1:35:38] knows all about it he did not get the
[1:35:41] 2023 without a plan
[1:35:43] [Applause]
[1:35:45] but he has not got the 2022 or 23 and
[1:35:49] changing his plan God had a plan at the
[1:35:52] beginning and he's about first class was
[1:35:54] always the good plan it was the Gospel
[1:35:57] of Jesus Christ it was a gospel of
[1:35:59] Salvation it was the Gospel of the Holy
[1:36:01] Ghost it was the Gospel amen putting
[1:36:04] everything back in his order and God
[1:36:06] knows exactly where the nail ever bored
[1:36:09] Hallelujah he put the godhead back in
[1:36:12] this place and he put this one back in
[1:36:14] his place what was he doing building a
[1:36:16] ship
[1:36:17] because there was a little ship aside
[1:36:19] because there were some Believers that
[1:36:21] was going to step on that ship one
[1:36:23] morning between six and nine and take
[1:36:25] their body chains and leave this place
[1:36:27] he knows exactly how to build a ship
[1:36:34] it made it through one flood it'll make
[1:36:37] it through another
[1:36:41] but you had to have a determination
[1:36:45] took a lot of determination a lot of
[1:36:47] nails a lot of boards a lot of work
[1:36:49] a lot of Heartache a lot of critics
[1:36:53] a lot of men saying he's mad and lost
[1:36:55] his mind
[1:36:56] a lot of them walking away maybe there's
[1:36:58] a few others that would help him at the
[1:36:59] beginning
[1:37:03] well there and again preaches a
[1:37:04] wonderful sermon on that you can go back
[1:37:06] and listen to it on I think on the fence
[1:37:09] sitting on the fence
[1:37:11] about Noah
[1:37:15] well where's the rain coming from
[1:37:18] I don't know where the rain coming from
[1:37:19] I just know God said it's going to rain
[1:37:24] how's this all going to work out in this
[1:37:26] end time we're living in brother too I
[1:37:28] don't know how it's all going to work
[1:37:29] out I just know what it is because God
[1:37:31] said so
[1:37:33] amen I I just know judgment's coming
[1:37:36] and I know before judgment there is an
[1:37:38] Enoch that's going to leave here
[1:37:41] because ain't it was persistence
[1:37:44] amen the Bible says and it was a certain
[1:37:46] age and he walked with God now there was
[1:37:48] a certain time in his life that he
[1:37:49] didn't walk with God or he he didn't
[1:37:51] have the persistence or he didn't have
[1:37:52] the love I don't whatever you want to
[1:37:54] play but then as a certain part of his
[1:37:56] life the scripture breaks into it and
[1:37:58] says from here on he walked with God
[1:38:01] so this morning if you find yourself on
[1:38:04] the other side of the fence on this
[1:38:06] situation listen God can change it
[1:38:10] God can change it very quickly amen and
[1:38:13] he walked with God and it became very
[1:38:15] persistent and it became a very loyal
[1:38:17] and it became very uh I just all the
[1:38:20] time walking with God and communing with
[1:38:23] God until one day the scripture said God
[1:38:25] took him
[1:38:27] snatched him out
[1:38:30] reach down in that old stormy water and
[1:38:33] reached out and said this one I'm going
[1:38:35] to take
[1:38:36] why did he do that
[1:38:39] why did he take note in Enoch
[1:38:41] why did he put that in scripture why did
[1:38:44] he show Enid walk with God and was not
[1:38:47] the seventh from Adam
[1:38:50] why because the seventh from the second
[1:38:52] Adam was going to have to have a place
[1:38:54] they could put their foot on
[1:38:56] a faith to believe and to keep on
[1:38:59] swimming a faith of believing when all
[1:39:01] things are going against them I can look
[1:39:03] back and said he did it one time and
[1:39:05] he's going to do it again because his
[1:39:07] word said he would
[1:39:10] and he put a faith to keep on no matter
[1:39:13] what the difficulties no matter what the
[1:39:15] struggle no matter what the Temptation
[1:39:17] no matter who walks away who says this
[1:39:20] or says that I'm walking with God
[1:39:27] and God took him
[1:39:32] he said he's exactly
[1:39:34] he said let me go back he says right
[1:39:35] after Noah had called the voice of God
[1:39:37] the great thing God's program he says
[1:39:41] there's a great thing that so many is
[1:39:43] missing seeing is God's program there's
[1:39:45] nothing running out of line
[1:39:47] hear that there's nothing running out of
[1:39:49] line it's exactly right exactly on time
[1:39:52] he is never behind
[1:39:57] Hallelujah the coming of the Lord will
[1:40:00] be just perfect the church will be just
[1:40:01] exactly in order when he comes he's just
[1:40:05] exactly on time all are stewing worrying
[1:40:08] will do nothing just be persevere with
[1:40:11] the word of God and move on God Is Right
[1:40:13] on Time be perfect every time like all
[1:40:17] things the Sun and the Moon everything
[1:40:18] that God's created has worked on time
[1:40:20] for thousands of years no after he heard
[1:40:23] this though he not being a scholar
[1:40:25] perhaps laughed at as the Bible said
[1:40:27] they were mockers full of them he knew
[1:40:29] all the lay ahead of him in a great
[1:40:31] scientific world he was sure that nobody
[1:40:34] was going to believe him
[1:40:37] but for 120 years he was perseverant and
[1:40:42] he laid one timber on another Timber One
[1:40:45] Nail and another nail one piece and
[1:40:48] another piece people laughing making fun
[1:40:51] all the while but it didn't stop him why
[1:40:53] he had faith in what he had heard
[1:40:58] hello Noah's he had faith in what he had
[1:41:01] heard and Noah was very persevering with
[1:41:04] his message and he was Fearless no
[1:41:06] matter what any of them said they might
[1:41:08] have called him anything that didn't
[1:41:09] stop him he had Faith to believe God's
[1:41:11] word and went right on building a heart
[1:41:13] no matter how scientific they could
[1:41:14] prove his message was wrong
[1:41:19] man does he not does he not sound like
[1:41:21] he's preaching today
[1:41:24] Mercy we've got all kind of scientific
[1:41:27] things
[1:41:29] well so did they did in Noah's day
[1:41:32] but where are them scientific things
[1:41:34] today
[1:41:38] there's a lot of scientific things and
[1:41:41] intellectual thoughts you can put
[1:41:42] together and try to prove this and this
[1:41:44] this and that and the other and this
[1:41:45] would be wrong that'd be wrong all this
[1:41:51] you know I I actually have a little bit
[1:41:53] more grace for those in Noah's day
[1:41:55] that could prove things scientific
[1:41:57] because they was actually there
[1:42:01] they could actually take the instruments
[1:42:03] and shoot them up or do whatever
[1:42:05] improve it ain't never rained before
[1:42:09] why you think it's going to rain now
[1:42:12] brother Brian talked about him being a
[1:42:13] very Advanced age
[1:42:16] even many times Advanced beyond what we
[1:42:18] are
[1:42:19] I have more grace in my mind for them
[1:42:22] than some of these today that want to
[1:42:24] take these scientific things and try to
[1:42:26] prove this message wrong and they wasn't
[1:42:28] even there
[1:42:32] come on now he said no matter how many
[1:42:35] tried to prove him wrong he kept going
[1:42:38] anyhow that's the way with a True
[1:42:40] Believer no matter how much they say
[1:42:42] this is not the holy spirit it's
[1:42:44] psychology some kind of Illusion it's
[1:42:46] telepathy whatever it is that don't stop
[1:42:49] God's people a bit they know God made
[1:42:51] the promise that in this day it would be
[1:42:53] here so they persevered and press on
[1:42:55] with the message Jesus said as it was in
[1:42:58] the days of Noah so shall it be at the
[1:43:01] coming of the son of man
[1:43:04] perseverant
[1:43:08] so many through the scriptures Moses
[1:43:10] had to be persevering but what caused
[1:43:13] his persistence
[1:43:15] he tried on his own it killed one
[1:43:17] Egyptian he feared for his life ran and
[1:43:20] he forgot all about it
[1:43:22] so it wasn't his own intellectual
[1:43:23] ability that gave him perseverance
[1:43:26] it wasn't his own theology that gave him
[1:43:29] perseverance it isn't what he thought
[1:43:31] about it gave him perseverance what gave
[1:43:33] him perseverance is a burning bush
[1:43:38] he met God for himself the god that his
[1:43:41] mama talked about and his daddy talked
[1:43:42] about and told him how angels of God had
[1:43:46] kept him on the river now and brought
[1:43:48] him to Pharaoh's house and raised him up
[1:43:50] in his house to know the ins and outs of
[1:43:52] how Pharaoh were that God was planning
[1:43:55] him to be a deliverer but no matter how
[1:43:57] much his mom and daddy told him it
[1:43:59] couldn't give him perseverance
[1:44:04] they could try to instill it in them all
[1:44:06] they wanted to he couldn't do it
[1:44:09] the only thing that could give him the
[1:44:11] perseverance he needed was me God for
[1:44:14] himself
[1:44:18] and that's the only thing that'll give
[1:44:20] you perseverance
[1:44:22] is when you had your moment with that
[1:44:25] Pillar of Fire
[1:44:26] and here he goes up and he finds himself
[1:44:28] on the backside of a desert
[1:44:30] and he finds himself
[1:44:38] thinking it's got to be somebody else
[1:44:40] it's got to be somebody else's do this
[1:44:42] and the Bible says the voice spoke and
[1:44:45] said Is You
[1:44:46] perseverance stepped into the place of
[1:44:50] his excuses
[1:44:52] did you hear that
[1:44:54] it's perseverance stepped into the place
[1:44:56] of his excuses nothing was going to stop
[1:44:59] it then Anything could happen but it'll
[1:45:02] never take you you can be persevering
[1:45:04] because you can't die you're already
[1:45:05] dead we have the earnest of our
[1:45:07] Salvation right now because we're risen
[1:45:09] with him raised with him setting
[1:45:10] Heavenly places right now with his
[1:45:12] assurance
[1:45:13] amen you go down to Joshua and Caleb
[1:45:15] what gave them perseverance because they
[1:45:18] saw the god that Moses talked about
[1:45:21] become reality and open up the way
[1:45:24] through the Wilderness and through the
[1:45:26] Red Sea that when they got to their
[1:45:28] inheritance they said hey we're more
[1:45:30] than able
[1:45:31] what do you mean we can't take it God's
[1:45:34] already showed us he's with us
[1:45:36] three sodas he'll snatch us out when
[1:45:39] we're about to go down so why would we
[1:45:41] doubt him now
[1:45:43] him now
[1:45:46] and that gave them Faith to stand on
[1:45:49] because of their experience in the word
[1:45:52] of God
[1:45:54] you know David had to have perseverance
[1:46:01] he had to have a place he could stand on
[1:46:04] you know what gave him perseverance
[1:46:09] he had some experience for one out on
[1:46:11] the backside of a desert with a line and
[1:46:13] with a bear
[1:46:16] he'd been practicing what he believed
[1:46:19] and he saw what he believed worked and
[1:46:22] not only that he'd been called in by the
[1:46:25] prophet
[1:46:26] and he had the anointing oil poured over
[1:46:28] his head
[1:46:30] El Albright of Jesus Christ been called
[1:46:34] in by the message of the prophet and the
[1:46:36] anointing of the Holy Ghost poured over
[1:46:38] their head
[1:46:39] and it gave him a Persistence of
[1:46:42] perseverance to believe that when he
[1:46:45] went out there and he heard that Giant's
[1:46:46] cry he said this man will be just as
[1:46:49] dead as that bear or that lion
[1:46:53] listen David didn't go down amen into
[1:46:56] the battle because he fought well he
[1:46:59] went down into the battle because he
[1:47:00] believed well
[1:47:02] he believed that God was able to snatch
[1:47:05] him out because God had put the oil over
[1:47:08] his head and God had anointed him for
[1:47:11] this moment
[1:47:13] come on little Davis who's here this
[1:47:15] morning that has also had those
[1:47:17] experiences I saw God heal this and I
[1:47:20] saw God do this and this God that did
[1:47:22] that is the same God today and he's able
[1:47:24] to take this Goliath's head off
[1:47:28] I'm not going to fight him cause I fight
[1:47:30] well I'm gonna fight him because I
[1:47:33] believe well I believe in the one who
[1:47:36] said it could happen
[1:47:39] and I'm going to stand upon his word he
[1:47:41] was the smallest out of all his family
[1:47:45] actually the least thought of
[1:47:48] because when when the prophet came
[1:47:52] his daddy called everybody else
[1:47:55] let's read the scripture he called
[1:47:56] everybody else and this one came by nope
[1:48:01] nope nope
[1:48:03] nope
[1:48:04] nope
[1:48:06] nope however many sons down
[1:48:09] finally there ain't no more sun staying
[1:48:11] in line
[1:48:12] Samuel stopped and he says
[1:48:14] do you have any more
[1:48:17] yeah yeah I got another
[1:48:19] well where is he he said he's back there
[1:48:22] attending to the Sheep he said go get
[1:48:24] him
[1:48:25] he said we're not going to sit down and
[1:48:27] eat till he comes
[1:48:29] amen this Prophet had a belief in what
[1:48:32] God had told him
[1:48:34] he didn't send him down to down to
[1:48:37] Jesse's house for nothing
[1:48:39] he sent him down to Jesse's house to
[1:48:42] anoint someone and the spirit of God
[1:48:44] would come by every time nope nope nope
[1:48:46] and when he ran out he knew there had to
[1:48:49] be another so he was persistent
[1:48:51] he's like hey you got another son yeah I
[1:48:54] got one we'll call it we're not going to
[1:48:56] sit down and win this little sheep heard
[1:48:58] her taken from the Sheep coat which
[1:49:00] means out of nothing
[1:49:03] a nobody God said this is a man after my
[1:49:07] own heart
[1:49:09] because he saw something on the inside
[1:49:11] of him David wasn't going to be unstable
[1:49:14] David was going to fight and be
[1:49:16] persistent
[1:49:18] and he anointed him and he went and
[1:49:21] killed a giant and killed many others
[1:49:23] for the glory of God
[1:49:27] he said if you can find the place
[1:49:29] in the plan of God
[1:49:31] if you can find that spot that word even
[1:49:34] though you may be sick and nearly dead
[1:49:38] you say well I'm a Christian how could
[1:49:40] that be in the plan of God it might be
[1:49:42] in God's plan to heal you
[1:49:45] and give you a testimony that will shake
[1:49:48] souls to the kingdom of God certainly he
[1:49:50] lets those things happen maybe you've
[1:49:52] had your ups and downs the enemy
[1:49:54] scorching you from every side it might
[1:49:57] have been that way that is all in God's
[1:50:00] plan
[1:50:02] might not be in your plan but it's in
[1:50:05] God's plan
[1:50:06] might not be how we would have planned
[1:50:08] it but that's the way God planned it
[1:50:10] because Allah promise you my plans would
[1:50:12] be a lot different
[1:50:14] but God has the ultimate saying
[1:50:18] just like in Joe's life when he was
[1:50:20] afflicted soars all over him that was
[1:50:23] all in the plan of God but job had to
[1:50:26] come to a point of being persevering
[1:50:28] because he knew he had kept God's word
[1:50:31] and he had offered the sacrifice and
[1:50:34] there was a sacrifice over his life
[1:50:37] therefore he knew God was not judging
[1:50:40] him because of his sin because he had
[1:50:42] offered a lamb
[1:50:45] so when the comforters would come
[1:50:48] and boy you go I listen to him here a
[1:50:49] while back and they go over here they
[1:50:51] pick his life apart and they look at
[1:50:54] this part and they look at this part and
[1:50:55] they look at this part and look at this
[1:50:57] part
[1:50:58] and job's like no I didn't do none of
[1:51:00] that no this is not true no I did not
[1:51:03] sin no there isn't sin in my life I have
[1:51:06] done things right I have offered desire
[1:51:07] and Joe's answer and answering all these
[1:51:09] comforters
[1:51:11] but then there's one comes
[1:51:14] he don't tell him he don't even really
[1:51:17] talk to him so much about his current
[1:51:18] situation he takes him back before
[1:51:23] he said job where were you
[1:51:26] before the Morning Star shouted for then
[1:51:28] the sons of God shouted where were you
[1:51:31] and then he takes him from where he was
[1:51:33] to where he was going to be
[1:51:38] and he lifted him up off that ass sheep
[1:51:41] to where he could look past 6 000 years
[1:51:44] or thousands of years and he could see
[1:51:48] the resurrected Jesus Christ and he said
[1:51:50] although the skin worms destroy my body
[1:51:52] yet in my flesh I will see God
[1:51:59] he knew
[1:52:00] I was there and I'm going to be there
[1:52:04] so what's happening here is not relevant
[1:52:08] to these
[1:52:10] that's that's what you got to get your
[1:52:12] mind to What's Happening Here is not
[1:52:14] relevant to these as far as your
[1:52:16] salvation you know you go through things
[1:52:18] in life you think well God doesn't love
[1:52:20] me now that don't change here here
[1:52:24] no no and they don't he still loves you
[1:52:26] you're just going through something but
[1:52:28] don't worry he's gonna make a way of
[1:52:30] Escape
[1:52:32] foreign
[1:52:33] Hallelujah got to be persistent got to
[1:52:37] push through the hard times
[1:52:39] and there's plenty of them
[1:52:42] you know Samson had to had to do that he
[1:52:45] had to be persistent
[1:52:47] and God would use him
[1:52:50] he would talk about it
[1:52:52] he said when he come down and grabbed to
[1:52:53] hold one of them skulls and killed a
[1:52:55] thousand Philistines single-handed
[1:52:58] didn't scare he didn't scare him he felt
[1:53:00] them Seven Locks
[1:53:02] they were hanging there and it gave him
[1:53:04] a perseverance to fight through anything
[1:53:10] it wasn't until that Covenant was cut
[1:53:12] off
[1:53:13] that he lost his ability to do what he
[1:53:16] is doing
[1:53:17] because he had given his secret he said
[1:53:18] as long as a Christian can know I'm
[1:53:21] living above sin there's a lamb that's
[1:53:23] been offered for My Sacrifice I'm
[1:53:25] perfect because the Lamb's perfect the
[1:53:28] holy spirit is blessing me and I'm
[1:53:30] standing with him I'm going to be
[1:53:31] persevered and pressed toward the mark
[1:53:33] of the High Calling amen Christians
[1:53:35] should every Christian should be that
[1:53:37] way very persistent in their way with
[1:53:40] God
[1:53:42] determined to fulfill
[1:53:46] he said well what if so and so says
[1:53:48] something this well you know there was a
[1:53:49] Greek woman
[1:53:52] she had a lot of difficulties
[1:53:55] a lot of problems to press through
[1:53:57] a lot of issues
[1:54:00] a lot of critics
[1:54:02] a lot of ones that told her you do you
[1:54:04] go brother go go listen to the servant
[1:54:06] go do this we're going to cut you off
[1:54:14] there was something in her heart I have
[1:54:15] a need
[1:54:18] I got a need from God
[1:54:22] and she wasn't out of the word of God
[1:54:23] she wasn't out of the will of God it was
[1:54:25] the will of God to heal
[1:54:28] but God was testing her faith
[1:54:31] and she pushes through all her
[1:54:33] disappointments and all of her struggles
[1:54:37] and she walks up and says Lord
[1:54:40] called him
[1:54:43] but what the Jews should have called him
[1:54:44] and
[1:54:45] he looks at her
[1:54:47] he said Lord I have this need my
[1:54:49] daughter he looked at her and you know
[1:54:50] he didn't give her a pat on the back
[1:54:54] didn't say you're doing a good job
[1:54:56] he said I wasn't even sent to your race
[1:55:01] in other words he called her a dog
[1:55:06] I wasn't even sent to you
[1:55:08] and he turns back around
[1:55:11] and brother Brandon said something rose
[1:55:13] up on that little faith
[1:55:15] rose up to a place and said yay Lord
[1:55:19] but even the dogs get the crumbs from
[1:55:22] the master's table
[1:55:26] he said her persistence and her attitude
[1:55:28] turned him back around and said you can
[1:55:31] have what you have what you say because
[1:55:33] I have not found Faith like this in
[1:55:34] Israel
[1:55:36] why because he was she was willing no
[1:55:39] matter what it took didn't matter what
[1:55:40] somebody's going to say what somebody's
[1:55:42] going to do what was going to go on it
[1:55:44] didn't matter I'm doing this for one
[1:55:46] reason it's for him
[1:55:49] and I'm doing it according to his word
[1:55:55] now you can do be doing things for him
[1:55:58] and be out of his word
[1:56:01] go listen to the tape doing God a
[1:56:02] service without his will his will is his
[1:56:05] word
[1:56:06] amen but when you're in his will and
[1:56:08] you're in his word you can be persistent
[1:56:14] and it doesn't matter what people say it
[1:56:16] doesn't matter what goes on in the
[1:56:18] church it doesn't matter what somebody
[1:56:19] says from the pulpit it matters not
[1:56:22] all that matters is him
[1:56:28] she had many hindrances but her faith
[1:56:31] didn't have any hindrance you might have
[1:56:32] many hindrance I have plenty of them
[1:56:33] lots of hindrance but what about your
[1:56:36] faith if you can't be persistent if
[1:56:38] you're going to let everything hinder
[1:56:40] you now physically you might feel bad
[1:56:42] physically you may not feel well
[1:56:43] otherwise you may not feel like going to
[1:56:45] church you may not feel like doing
[1:56:46] anything but your faith doesn't have no
[1:56:49] hindrances it'll move you anyhow maybe
[1:56:52] your pastor prayed for you anointed you
[1:56:54] with all that's what he's supposed to do
[1:56:55] and you go back and say Pastor I don't
[1:56:57] feel no better oh my you're ought not
[1:57:00] come up in the first place you're going
[1:57:02] by your feelings but start going by your
[1:57:04] faith
[1:57:06] God's gonna answer me God's going to
[1:57:08] meet me God's going to touch me
[1:57:12] [Music]
[1:57:13] he said your faith in the word of God
[1:57:15] call the Elders of the Elders of the
[1:57:17] church let them anoint you with oil and
[1:57:19] pray over you and the prayer of faith
[1:57:21] shall save the sick
[1:57:23] if you got faith in God faith and prayer
[1:57:25] then go on anyhow but nothing's going to
[1:57:27] stop it you've got faith you believe it
[1:57:30] Faith doesn't have any hindrance but
[1:57:33] this woman had plenty of hindrance
[1:57:35] you have plenty of hindrances physical
[1:57:37] and spiritual but if your faith believes
[1:57:40] in God there's no hindrance in your
[1:57:42] faith
[1:57:43] doesn't matter who you are it doesn't
[1:57:45] matter what you believe if you believe
[1:57:47] God's word and have faith there then you
[1:57:49] have something you can stand on
[1:57:54] Mercy we're going down
[1:58:03] she admitted what he said was the truth
[1:58:05] I'm not worthy Lord
[1:58:07] I'm but I'm here for the crumbs
[1:58:09] it's true children eat your right Lord
[1:58:11] your word is true every one of them I'm
[1:58:13] not worthy sit at the table with the
[1:58:15] children but Lord
[1:58:16] let me call something to your attention
[1:58:18] the dogs are willing to eat the crumbs
[1:58:21] and if I can just get a crumb
[1:58:24] because she knew why did she ask for a
[1:58:27] crime because she knew everything that
[1:58:29] was in the loaf of bread was in that
[1:58:31] crumb
[1:58:35] man God may not give you the whole loaf
[1:58:37] he may not at all at once just put the
[1:58:39] whole loaf in your hand he may just give
[1:58:41] you a crumb here and a crumb there and a
[1:58:43] crumb here but if you're just willing to
[1:58:45] take the crumbs
[1:58:46] God's able to fulfill what you have need
[1:58:49] of in your body what you have need of in
[1:58:51] your spirit what you have need of in
[1:58:52] your heart what you have need of and
[1:58:54] around you God is able
[1:58:56] because everything that was in the loaf
[1:58:58] is in the crumb
[1:59:01] we ought to be Chrome Seekers
[1:59:03] because God has promises he's the bread
[1:59:06] of life he's the bread that came down of
[1:59:09] Heaven if all I can get when I come is a
[1:59:11] crumb
[1:59:13] I want what God has for me
[1:59:18] this is what he would say and being
[1:59:20] persistent he says you can have 25 cents
[1:59:23] the purchase and power of a loaf of
[1:59:25] bread we need about five dollars and 25
[1:59:27] cents a day
[1:59:30] he said but you can be as happy with
[1:59:32] that because you know it will buy what
[1:59:34] you have need of
[1:59:36] and he said we have the blood of Jesus
[1:59:38] Christ it has purchased everything that
[1:59:40] we have need of from here to Glory
[1:59:43] so we can be persistent and we can hold
[1:59:46] on and we can stand there when all hell
[1:59:49] is against us and it will be
[1:59:53] amen we can have courage in the middle
[1:59:56] of the devil's howling the devil wants
[1:59:58] to howl and he wants to howl and he
[2:00:00] wants to howl and say I'm going to tear
[2:00:01] this down and I'm going to tear this
[2:00:02] church up and I'm going to do this and
[2:00:04] I'm going to do this there ain't going
[2:00:05] to be no bride let him how
[2:00:08] you know when he's howling you know why
[2:00:09] he's howling because he's about to be
[2:00:11] exposed
[2:00:13] amen when he begins to scream out and it
[2:00:16] begins to curse and it begins to he
[2:00:18] knows you're right at the moment of your
[2:00:20] victory
[2:00:21] and he's trying everything he can do to
[2:00:24] keep you from grabbing a hold of the
[2:00:26] whole loaf
[2:00:34] wherefore
[2:00:37] let him that thinketh he stand
[2:00:40] take heed lest he fall
[2:00:43] there has no temptation taking you but
[2:00:46] such is common to man
[2:00:48] but God is faithful
[2:00:55] God is faithful
[2:00:57] who will not suffer you to be tempted
[2:00:59] above all that you're able but will with
[2:01:01] the Temptation also make a way of Escape
[2:01:04] a word that he's given us to have faith
[2:01:09] to finish to fulfill

[2:01:49] deal with the consequences if I talk you
[2:01:51] off the cliff somebody else will talk
[2:01:53] you back on the cliff but this word will
[2:01:56] give you strength to stand
[2:02:00] being off different dismayed fear not

[2:02:16] of my righteousness John 10 and verse 27
[2:02:19] says my sheep hear my voice and I know
[2:02:22] them and they follow me I give them
[2:02:24] eternal life and they will never perish
[2:02:30] you may feel like you're about to go

[2:02:36] like you're about to Bubble for the last
[2:02:38] time they will never perish come on
[2:02:41] Peter he's got enough hand to reach down
[2:02:43] on that water and pick you up and make
[2:02:46] you walk on water again
[2:02:51] you'll never perish
[2:02:52] Philippians 4 19 he says my God Will

[2:06:08] talking about Jacob you ever heard of
[2:06:10] Jacob's pillow with stone
[2:06:13] it's more than just a good story
[2:06:16] you know that stone if you'll begin to
[2:06:18] study it it's the same rock that
[2:06:21] followed the children of Israel
[2:06:25] Hallelujah I'll show you he lighted upon
[2:06:28] a sergeant I'm giving you Faith to stand
[2:06:30] to keep swimming
[2:06:32] he lighted upon a certain place and
[2:06:33] teared there all night because the sun
[2:06:35] was set and he took of the stones of
[2:06:37] that place and put them for his pillow
[2:06:38] and laid down in that place to sleep and
[2:06:40] he dreamed and behold a ladder set on
[2:06:42] the earth top of it reached to the
[2:06:44] heaven and behold the angels of God
[2:06:45] ascending and descending
[2:06:49] you know we I've seen a lot of drawings
[2:06:51] or some drawings of this pewter
[2:06:52] beautiful paintings you ever seen him
[2:06:54] how many ever seen a painting of this
[2:06:55] jacob laying at the ladder Angels but
[2:06:58] that's more than just a painting what
[2:07:00] were their Angels what was the Angels
[2:07:02] doing it was going in delivering
[2:07:04] messages snatching people out of
[2:07:06] situations going back up
[2:07:12] if you'll get past it being more than
[2:07:14] just a story
[2:07:15] more than just a painting brother Adam
[2:07:17] said where was that ladder tied to he
[2:07:20] said that ladder was tied on one end to
[2:07:23] the throne of God and the other end to
[2:07:25] the Rock Jesus Christ
[2:07:27] he said why did he do it that way so
[2:07:30] those promises that he was sending up
[2:07:32] and down off that ladder they wouldn't
[2:07:34] slip
[2:07:36] oh Hallelujah but they was going to be
[2:07:38] constant and they was going to be there
[2:07:40] for you in your darkest trial an angel
[2:07:43] was going to come down and give you a
[2:07:45] piece of bread an angel is going to come
[2:07:47] down and give you a promise of God and
[2:07:49] God was going to minister to you in your
[2:07:52] time of struggle
[2:07:54] hallelujah amen this is more than just a
[2:07:57] beautiful picture this is thus saith the
[2:07:59] Lord God's will for you that you have a
[2:08:02] place that you can rest upon
[2:08:06] oh it might be hard it might be all kind
[2:08:09] of things all hell might be against you
[2:08:11] but you can rest in the middle of the
[2:08:13] storm why because you're sleeping and
[2:08:16] resting on the Rock of Ages
[2:08:20] Hallelujah
[2:08:24] because listen to this
[2:08:26] he comes down in verse 13. and behold
[2:08:30] the Lord stood above it and said I am
[2:08:33] the Lord God of Abraham thy father
[2:08:36] he wanted to Jacob know who he was thy
[2:08:40] father and the god of Isaac and the land
[2:08:43] were on thy lies to thee will I give it
[2:08:46] and to thy seed and thy seed shall be as
[2:08:49] the dust of the earth what was it this
[2:08:51] is the same promise he told Abraham
[2:08:54] it was the same promise it was now being
[2:08:57] moved over to Jacob
[2:09:01] he said Jacob I'm going to give you a
[2:09:02] reason to keep swimming
[2:09:05] keep moving because I seed shall be as
[2:09:07] the dust of the earth and thou shalt
[2:09:09] spread abroad to the West the East and
[2:09:11] North the South and in thee in that seed
[2:09:13] shall all families of the earth be
[2:09:15] blessed and behold
[2:09:17] I am with thee
[2:09:21] he didn't say I'm with I was with
[2:09:23] Abraham he said I am with thee and will
[2:09:26] keep thee and all the places whether
[2:09:28] thou goest and will bring thee again to
[2:09:30] this land for I will not leave thee
[2:09:33] until I've done that which I've spoken
[2:09:35] of thee and Jacob woken up out of sleep
[2:09:38] and said surely the Lord is in this
[2:09:40] place
[2:09:42] and I knew it not
[2:09:45] God maybe that'll be yours your thoughts
[2:09:49] today maybe you've been a been a kind of
[2:09:51] in a disarrayed delusion but today you
[2:09:54] can be woken up and realize hey God is
[2:09:58] in this place
[2:10:00] God is
[2:10:01] God is Among Us
[2:10:03] entering these God is touching Hearts
[2:10:05] God is ministering God is dealing with
[2:10:08] the needs of his people
[2:10:10] and angels are ascending and descending
[2:10:13] and moving back and forth amen because
[2:10:16] it's a ladder that's still existing
[2:10:18] today
[2:10:21] it's still there today listen he says
[2:10:23] look look at Jesus to identify himself
[2:10:25] with a stone that would never let the
[2:10:27] promises slip this stone that would
[2:10:29] anchor forever
[2:10:31] can somebody say forever anchor forever
[2:10:34] and forever God's coveted and promised
[2:10:36] people he said does thou believe what
[2:10:38] I've told you these things Thou shalt
[2:10:40] see greater things in this you shall see
[2:10:42] the heavens open and the angels of God
[2:10:45] ascending and descending upon the Son of
[2:10:47] God up and down Jacob's Ladder
[2:10:51] because he's God's anchor as long as I'm
[2:10:54] in Christ Jesus I'm Anchored In God the
[2:10:57] Angels ascending and descending going up
[2:10:59] first and coming down what are they
[2:11:00] doing they're taking messages up and
[2:11:03] bringing messages down taking messages
[2:11:04] up taking messages down he was that
[2:11:07] anchoring place for Jacob's Ladder Jesus
[2:11:09] was where the promised seed would come
[2:11:11] from he was God's Eternal promise see he
[2:11:14] was that sure Stone he was that perfect
[2:11:17] Foundation that God's truth can anchor
[2:11:20] in and all devils in hell and everything
[2:11:22] else will never move it God has anchored
[2:11:25] it forever in him
[2:11:29] so you can take the word of God and just
[2:11:32] keep swimming
[2:11:34] because God's going to move
[2:11:36] somehow I don't know how
[2:11:39] I don't know how God's going to do it I
[2:11:41] just know he's going to do it
[2:11:43] how do you know he's going to because he
[2:11:45] said he was
[2:11:48] therefore it gives me the strength to
[2:11:51] just keep swimming
[2:11:57] brother Brown tells us a story
[2:12:00] being up in Colorado
[2:12:02] so standing on a mountain is watching
[2:12:04] old mother Eagle as she brought her
[2:12:05] little ones from The Nest on her wings
[2:12:08] and set them down in a grassy pasture
[2:12:12] people won't say ah don't happen Eagles
[2:12:14] don't do that well the Bible said they
[2:12:16] do
[2:12:19] he said as an eagle beareth her Young on
[2:12:21] his wing her wings
[2:12:24] so however you want to look at it you
[2:12:27] got scientific proof it don't happen
[2:12:28] that's up to you I just know what the
[2:12:30] Bible said
[2:12:31] and I got confidence in this prophet and
[2:12:33] he said he watched them as they come
[2:12:35] down and she flew back up to the very
[2:12:37] highest peak on a rock she could go and
[2:12:39] she began to watch
[2:12:41] and as I was watching through my
[2:12:42] binoculars my horse hissed to a tree and
[2:12:45] I was just watching
[2:12:48] he said my you told me you ever been
[2:12:50] around the Eagle's Nest he said they
[2:12:51] make all the sharp sticks and things and
[2:12:53] more poor little Eagles Walk around
[2:12:54] those thick sticks and Thorns they never
[2:12:57] knew anything else but one day the
[2:12:58] mother spread her forth her wings
[2:13:00] and she stepped out on the wings and
[2:13:02] went down they stepped out on wings went
[2:13:04] down I looked at those little fellas
[2:13:05] they was having themselves a Pentecostal
[2:13:07] Revival down in that little field they
[2:13:10] were running down that soft grass
[2:13:12] picking here chirping there jumping
[2:13:14] around I thought well that's right now
[2:13:16] that's just like a man in an old mess of
[2:13:19] the world knows nothing but what the
[2:13:20] devil can give him but one day God picks
[2:13:23] him up sets him down on some shady Green
[2:13:25] Pastures and how he rejoices and he's
[2:13:28] free there's nothing no harm I thought
[2:13:30] why why ain't those little fellas afraid
[2:13:31] wonder if they realize there's coyotes
[2:13:33] around here try to pick them up but all
[2:13:35] at once in a while they would just look
[2:13:37] up
[2:13:39] and they would see the old mother Eagles
[2:13:40] sitting up there I thought well praise
[2:13:42] be to God he's taking me out of the
[2:13:44] nests of the world and he's climbed to
[2:13:46] the ramparts of glory and he's sitting
[2:13:49] High watching over his Heritage and if a
[2:13:52] coyote would ever start towards one of
[2:13:54] us Little Eagles she would flog him to
[2:13:56] death
[2:13:58] come on somebody he said that's right
[2:14:01] let Satan take after a Believer he's got
[2:14:03] Jesus Christ on his hands
[2:14:07] Hallelujah the devil ain't just dealing
[2:14:09] with you he's dealing with God
[2:14:13] she was watching with her great Majestic
[2:14:15] head looking around she was on the
[2:14:17] highest Rock because she could see her
[2:14:18] so she could see after a while seeing
[2:14:20] her raise her head up and I'd look
[2:14:22] through my 10 power binoculars I said
[2:14:24] what is it way back over in the north a
[2:14:26] northern the storm is coming thunder
[2:14:28] began to Roar and lightning began to fly
[2:14:30] and she let out a scream and down
[2:14:32] through there she went with those big
[2:14:34] old Wings right on that grassy parrot
[2:14:36] Prairie every one of them little Eagles
[2:14:37] ran over real quick they were instructed
[2:14:39] perhaps before leaving the nest and they
[2:14:42] caught their little feet right in the
[2:14:43] feathers throwed that little mouth down
[2:14:45] hooked their little Bill across the
[2:14:47] feather she raised up with a bunch of
[2:14:49] eaglets and on his wings and went just
[2:14:51] straight through that wind as hard as
[2:14:52] she could go right back to the cleft of
[2:14:55] The Rock he said I sat there and cried
[2:14:57] like a baby I thought some glorious day
[2:14:59] when this Revival's over he's going to
[2:15:01] come from glory and he's going to spread
[2:15:04] forth those wings of power and Us Little
[2:15:06] Eagles are going to hook our beaks in
[2:15:08] there and fly to Glory with him
[2:15:12] Hallelujah God is determined to fulfill
[2:15:16] his word therefore we must also be
[2:15:19] determined to fulfill
[2:15:23] God is going to take care of you
[2:15:27] some of you just need to say that God's
[2:15:29] going to take care of me
[2:15:31] he's going to Watch Over Me
[2:15:34] he's going to see when that old coyote
[2:15:36] slick-headed fella is going to show up
[2:15:39] he's going to see it
[2:15:41] and he's going to be there for you he's
[2:15:43] going to watch When Storms gather
[2:15:45] he knows when they're coming he knows
[2:15:48] they're coming before you even do
[2:15:52] so how you feel like you're going to be
[2:15:54] able to prepare when you don't even know
[2:15:56] it's coming
[2:16:00] but all God already has a preparation
[2:16:03] flee to him
[2:16:04] get to the Rock
[2:16:07] catch a hole on the wings
[2:16:09] of faith
[2:16:10] and Rise Above It All asparians

[2:17:35] he's a God that has a plan
[2:17:38] and his plan will never fail
[2:17:45] foreign but Lord
[2:17:48] if God could put something in a rat
[2:17:52] to just have one moment of being pulled
[2:17:54] out of water
[2:17:56] dried off a little bit and put right
[2:17:58] back in

[2:18:34] of how he rescued and he moved and he
[2:18:37] touched

[2:20:39] Lord that could be such a deposit in our
[2:20:41] hearts Lord
