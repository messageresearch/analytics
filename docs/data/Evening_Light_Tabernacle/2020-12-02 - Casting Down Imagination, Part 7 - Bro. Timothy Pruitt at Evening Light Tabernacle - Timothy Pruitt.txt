[Music] is [Applause] [Music] bless me today [Music] oh amen let's turn our bibles to isaiah 55 and if you would this evening amen it's good to be in the house of the lord amen also john chapter 13 as well i'd like to continue on casting down imaginations amen casting down imaginations says chapter 55 and verse 8 says for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts praise the lord for that amen also john chapter 13 and verse 27 and it says after the soph satan entered into him then said jesus unto him do that thou doest do quickly amen we'll let you be seated today i've been pondering thinking about no doubt am i trying to imagine the mind battles that judas must have had the imaginations that would run through his mind the thoughts that satan was constantly coming at him time after time after time you know as he did with eve you know i'm sure it wasn't the first time that the serpent would take talk to eve that the act was committed that caused the fall it was no doubt days years who knows how long that it would take for him to win the confidence of eve and this is how even satan would even come to judas's mind as he would come and he would begin to interject thoughts into his mind and you know and the miracles he had to witness and all the things he had heard and saw and no doubt the mind battles and the things that were taking place inside of him yet when it came down to it his thoughts overtook him his reasonings and his imaginations became bigger than his faith to where instead of healings and miracles and the word made flesh he only saw money in popularity amen satan got a hold of his head and from there and his thinking and from there entered into his heart and into his soul the or in other words his thoughts became his belief see judas had it in his mind but he refused to go all the way now we know brother branham would speak about how he he'd come right up to pentecost but he refused the baptism of the holy ghost he would get to thank to sanctification and justification all those places but he wouldn't go all the way and you know the bible would also would also speak of this in proverbs 23 and verse 7 it says for as he thinketh in his heart so is he now you know the heart does not think there's no place in the heart amen that physical heart to think but it's speaking of a spiritual place and you know when brother brandon would talk about this place that there was actually a young lady that brought him an article that was put out by science it was in a newspaper article and she said brother branham i'll show you something i heard you say about a man thinking in his heart he said i read it in the bible she said now today they've they found it and proved it it's not there's not it's not in no other heart but the human heart it isn't even in an animal heart anywhere but there's a little compartment in the heart that science says is the place where the soul abides therefore god was right when he said a man think as a man thinketh in his heart there is a mental faculty in the heart it's called the soul amen and in all all of you he has he said has had this times when you would think something you'd say well i don't know whether it could happen or not and all of a sudden something would begin to speak out or once something would begin to happen he said we've all had those kind of experience he said when regardless of what any all of a sudden something says it's going to happen regardless of any what anybody says he said we all had that he said that's when your heart is thinking and when it's dropped from here down into your heart it becomes a settled thing you know amen you can't as we've been talking about imaginations you can't stop thoughts from coming to your mind you can't keep that from happening but what you want to be careful is that thought don't drop down into your heart because when that thought drops down into your heart amen it becomes your belief amen now we know we know that the seal of god changes everything that that all no matter what kind of thought comes it can never get into that place amen but see thinking and thoughts as you begin you know i thought about it with homosexual thinking amen maybe it starts out very subtle and very easy and very light you know and very basic thoughts but against to get deeper and deeper until it can finally fall into that heart towards no more a thought of homosexuality it's a belief that that's who i am and this is where even judas would come to that he would no longer just think about it he would actually begin to pull it would fall from here into his soul realm to where he would actually walk and walk there and deny the very jesus called christ and we're seeing men and women this hour that we're living in that has thought about it they thought about the message they've had it in their mind they're thinking about it they've kept it there it's been an intellectual revelation amen this never came into their heart it's never fell down to where it actually became what they believed no matter what anybody says amen we can see people that actually say i believe the message but then somebody can say something contrary or bring some kind of thing up here over here and all of a sudden it destroys their whole their whole thought process because it wasn't really what they believed because once it gets down into the heart there's no change in it once it gets down into that realm of the soul amen when you realize it's not my what i think in my mind but it's what i believe in my heart that it's over with the devil can come the devil can question the devil can bring whatever he wants to bring up it does not matter no more it's there it's placed inside of you amen and he said see the mind reasons but the heart doesn't reason it just believes he said if i could ever drive home to my audience i am into he said to have a real amen a real healing service if i could ever get my audience to see that it's not what your head thinks at all that's where the devil comes but he'll reason it all out i'm sick i can't get well i'm saved i can't get i can't i'm sin i have full of sin i can't be saved i've done too much see that's reasoning but you've got to cast down those reasonings and believe with your heart amen amen if you're not careful what you think will become your belief that ain't that what that'll be no longer be i think i can't be saved but you'll become i you'll believe it and then it's impossible to get to get anywhere with god that's what happened in the garden of eden man was divided in two parts the devil took his head and god took his heart the devil makes him look at things and say well it just can't happen it'll reason it all out but god took his heart to dwell in his heart to make him believe things that his head don't even know anything about i don't know yet that's right so it's your heart it's in your heart you think down here that's where the real certain sound comes from it's from the heart when where god talks is in the heart but up here is where the devil talks but let's cast down what the devil says and take what god says let's cast down the uncertain sound and can take the certain sound what god is saying in our heart amen he said a man thinks with his head but he believes with his heart the devil thinks through his mind to show him something with his eye but his heart will make him believe something that'll be impossible to ever see you may not ever see it with your eye but you'll still believe it why you're not believing with this right here you're believing with your heart amen you may not ever feel it you may not ever see it you may not ever taste it you may not it has nothing to do with it because it's not connected with this brain mentality anymore it's fell from here down into your heart and this is what he says we said we've got to get from our head into our heart hallelujah amen our walk with christ has to get from our head into our hearts a service has to get from our head into our hearts every day with god has to get from our head into our heart to where it becomes our belief not what i think but what i believe those two different things people mix those up they think what they think is their belief but no it's got to go deeper than that because many people have thought the message is right but today they don't believe it amen why because it never fell into their heart amen something was always there as a question he said if we could ever get away from our head knowledge and head religion to a heart religion where god could go to work amen out of our head and into our heart a man believes in his heart and he but he thinks with his head the mind reasons the heart never reasons it just believes what god says but you see today we're so scientific we got to have it proved we got to have this but you know in the old days when somebody said the lord did a miracle they just believed it they thought that's right thank the lord for it but today it's got to be scientifically proven are we not seeing that in the message now now all of a sudden the message has to be scientifically proven listen you can't scientifically prove god it's impossible i mean men have blown their brains out trying to scientifically prove god there's always an attribute of god you'll never be able to scientifically prove you'll never be able to prove it with this brain amen it's impossible god so far his thoughts are higher than our thoughts as high as the heaven is above and so is his heart thoughts higher than our that's that's in that's an innumerable amount amen they're still looking into the skies and they found the end of it and he's trying to tell you my thoughts are this much higher than your thoughts i'm thinking if i'm thankful his thoughts are higher than my thoughts in other words what he thought of me overrides what i think of me amen what he thinks of me overrides what you think of me hallelujah amen what he thinks of me overrides what the devil thinks of me but it's got to fall into the heart if it does not get to the heart amen the devil can talk you out of it amen if somebody talked you into it somebody talk you out of it amen this is not what the message is about it's a belief amen it was just like mary amen mary one time was trying to figure it out she was trying to reason the scriptures and and the prophet isaiah said that said this and i heard the the fair the the preacher said this and what am i going to do about it all of a sudden she has a visitation and she says she sees all the things laid out before what happened she didn't respond with her mind she responded with her heart her heart said be it unto me according to thy word amen that's why we got to make sure our thinking is lined up with the word of god because your thinking will become your belief you know but people's got to have everything proved you know we're we're in the time of proving everything you know and they're trying to prove today what happened 40 50 60 70 80 even almost 100 years ago and they're and they're willing to take amen what somebody else says or what somebody else's questions uh somebody had talked to me about a man that was coming to him question the message and said i need you to answer these questions the man looked at him gave him a real good reply he said those ain't my questions those are your questions i don't have to answer them because i ain't question i don't have those questions amen what is it the devil tries to put things in your mind constantly i know he does even as young people or even older people and thoughts are constantly bombard and that's why it's important you you filter them out you realize is this thought lined up with the word of god nope cast it down amen is this with the word of god nope put it aside that's not who i am that's not what i believe amen you know what if moses would have said wait a minute here let me stop what kind of chemical spray has been put on that tree what kind of leaves are all that's on fire but they're not burning that must be some kind of synthetic and try to figure it all out that wasn't what it was about he said oh wait you know maybe i need to pick up some of them leaves and take them to a laboratory and get it all analyzed and try to analyze it all you know we want to analyze everything and everything's got to match up just right listen you you can't even get the there's let's just be honest there's things in this bible as far as humanly thinking you'll never match up altogether right because god is trying to tell you something it's not about how you can put it together with your mind it's to him that says yes lord i believe it no matter what it says i believe it he said if he would have had any of those kind of thoughts if if moses would have had those kind of thoughts god would have never said take off your shoes mercy think about that one for a moment if it had any of those kind of thoughts about the moment god come down in that burning bush and he'd had those kind of thoughts god would have never said take off his shoes he would have never spoke to him well what did he do he walked up humbly he didn't care what the fire was if it was burning how is burning whether a tree burned up or not he was searching for god he needed god and every child of god will believe the same way he'll hear the same voice take off your shoes you're on holy ground amen i'm here to visit you i'm here to touch your heart i'm here to change your life you know i mean yeah as he said it goes on he said you know people can come anywhere and they can pick apart anything they can analyze every anything you know people make too much noise the preacher preaches too long uh i can scientifically tell you there's there's people there that's weary they all not stay up that long you know and listen to all that go ahead but those who come with their shoes off come on now those who come with their shoes off and their knowledge left behind and a heart opened up to god you'll hear them say i am the resurrection in life those that are willing to lay aside their pride and say yes lord i it's not what i think anyhow i i don't even know how it's gonna be it's not how i think anyhow it's how you are lord it's your thoughts god it's your word god it's you lord that's all that matters he said that's the reason the little compartment's in your heart god mowed you that way a little place in your heart satan will come to the mind but the heart belongs to god god made himself a little room there it could he could sit in the controlling tower that he could guide you oh blessed be his holy name we could let him be the pilot the holy ghost of col the co-pilot he'd be got we we would be guided over the sea of life in this control room well what did man do he listened to his fellow man and he accepted the devil there and the devil came in and begins to guide him no wonder people came to believe in divine healing with the devil sitting there saying don't you believe it no wonder why people they can't believe in in a prayer line when the devil's sitting there saying it ain't so no more no wonder why people can't believe it and then the supernatural move of god when people are saying it's a day gone by listen what people are saying are actually what spirits have said come on somebody amen the words that comes out of our mouth but no man can serve two masters we either serve in one or the other amen words are thoughts expressed where are the thoughts coming from people don't understand when they hear a thought that says you can't get up or you can't get well that's actually a spirit talking to you that's a devil talking to you that's a spirit that's trying to keep you in that condition and keep you bound and keep you down and keep you uh uh you know bound in sin and unbelief that is a spirit there but there is another there is another voice hallelujah amen just like those voices in that chicken yard of that chicken barking this and back and forth remember there was another voice and it caught that little eagle's attention amen and it turned his eye somewhere else hallelujah listen the further we go along the more the chickens are going to squawk say days of miracles are passed and it's impossible and and you know brother brandon made this mistake and he had hello somebody brother branham was a man how many men in here women in here don't has never made a mistake in your life i don't see no hands if i do i'm going to call you a liar right from the pulpit amen we've all made mistakes but somehow men are now the jury and the judge on a prophet and saying well he made this mistake and he made that mistake and he made this mistake he that's without sin cast the first stone the chickens are going to squawk they do what chickens do squawk just let them squawk that ain't who we are eagles fly and they're about to witness the greatest eagle migration ever when the eagles lift up out of this old barnyard this whole world is so tired of it i don't know about you but i'm tired of it this whole world that's over this side this voice and this side this boy negativity here negativity there negativity and chickens are squawking and this one over here squawking we're about to leave here yeah you know people don't realize how many times right in the service i mean a thought can come in and they think well i just thought no that's a spirit that's talking to you that's a spirit that's interjecting things and trying to get you distracted and trying to get your eyes off of what's really important trying to get you amen over on some other thing somewhere amen it may be seemingly very harmless and maybe and maybe it ain't all you know a bunch of sin and much ungodliness that you're thinking i hope not but i mean things are awful way over here what is it spirits are trying to hinder you they're trying to keep you from what's really important this is why it's important to cast down imaginations amen and say no they don't line up with the word of god amen i'm holding the line i'm i'm holding right here what is the word of god i'll believe what ain't the word of god i cast down i lay it aside that's what abraham had to do god told him he's going to have a child ridiculous it sounded pretty ridiculous at a 65 year old and 75 year old man and woman walking downtown to buy some bobby pins and bird eye diapers pretty ridiculous to the human mind abraham have you ever had a baby before no how old are you sarah 65 how old are you abraham 75 what are you doing with all those things for a baby we're going to have one well i i i can scientifically prove you she's 25 20 years 25 years past menopause you're you're a bunch of ignorant people but abraham called those things which are not as though they were why because god said so god had placed it in his heart and it wasn't going to make making him move away from it 25 years 30 years whatever it was he was going to hold to the line the line is the word of god oh come on now amen we've been we've been in this message now 50 something years what a 60 years since the prophet left nearly so the chickens are squawking so people are making fun so people are denying and walking away i can't help it judas did that why because they allow the thoughts to become their belief it don't matter yet time does not matter to god amen yeah you know a minute a second you know years that matters a lot to us you know especially if you get older you're used to 20 years matter now 10 years matter five years matter one year matters one day matters depends on how old you are but to god it don't matter he could care less of his 20 years 30 years 100 years thousand years time is is irrelevant to god it does not determine his word thankfully is not determined by time allotments we put time to god but god doesn't put time to himself god speaks the word and it comes to pass amen no matter how it's said or what how long it takes how difficult it becomes when god says it it comes to pass and when he said i have a bribe without spot with rent without wrinkle he said it that's his thoughts it's not my thoughts i don't know how he's going to do it i see him possibilities i do i mean as far as humanly speaking you say god how's it going to be i don't know how is it going to be he just said it was going to be a body change how's that going to happen that's impossible for a human body to go back to a young body young bones young organs young everything how is that possible i don't know how it's possible god said so that's all that matters didn't matter if sarah was feeling good or bad she felt pregnant or not didn't have one thing to do with it god said so it didn't matter if if if she felt it or not no different don't matter we're going to have it anyhow why because it had come from here into here i mean it went beyond a human ability to think and to comprehend and to put it all together abraham obviously was not relying on this little p brain or he gave up a long time ago but he was holding on to it with his heart 20 years past didn't matter god said so it wasn't in his head it was in his heart god don't speak in the head he speaks in the heart that's where god lives if god is on the throne he stirs you to believe for the impossible oh my hallelujah he makes you go and see things that he wants you to go and see oh my he turned your eyes from what the the things that the devil talks about and you stay right with god the bible said it i'm going to believe it no matter what takes place i'm going to hold on i'm a child of abraham just like abraham did i will do hallelujah but the devil is constantly trying to get through that channel of the mind he did it with brother branham he did it with it did it with all the people through the bible he did it with jesus i mean goodness he done it he does it with everybody that's where he comes to the channel of the mind you know he would make this statement he said i've made many mistakes and still make them and we'll always make them so for you negative message people out there he admitted he made mistakes just like any real man would do we all make them still make them and when i make them the holy spirit tells me that i'm wrong and then i repent right there lord forgive me didn't mean to do it you help me now and i walk right on the same thing because no sooner than it goes from my lips the devils will say no sooner than it goes from my lips if we confess our sins he will forgive him is that right but no sooner it goes from my lips the devil says you know what i'll tell you you were supposed to do a certain thing and you didn't do it he said you know what i tell him i confessed it already it's already under the blood don't talk to me about it i confess my wrongs and he forgive me how do i know he said he would and i don't talk to him about it no more i just keep moving on come on now that's where you got to stop the devil in this tracks many of you young people in different ones he's come at you and said well look what you've done look at your past look at your mistake i've now confessed it already it's in the blood of jesus christ and he don't even know what you're talking about and you walk on and ignore him cast down imaginations he says he goes on another one he says he said i see a crutch sitting back here by a lady if the devil can make her believe she's going to have to use that crutch to go out of here on it's whipped how does he make her believe thoughts if the devil can make her believe she's going to have to use that crutch to get out of here it's whipped but when she won't look at that crutch but she'll look at god's promise it'll be left at the seat praise the lord i pray a lot of crutches can be left at the seat tonight amen it don't have to be a physical crutch we can talk about spiritual crutches complexes and fears and all that just leave it at the seat look at the promise of god and say yes lord your promises are yeah and amen your thoughts are higher than my thoughts i can't figure it out so i'm just going to leave it here at the seat hallelujah you have the ability to walk out of this building a free person by changing your look and your thinking and begin to think on the word of god and deny that imagination it says you have to stay bound you don't have to stay bound but if she'll say i've been crippled for years that don't have nothing to do with it it's what god said see satan he said satan did this to me a while ago he says he told me while coming up here to preach you're too hoarse to preach satan now we would have thought that's just a thought really and you know you know what i'm saying with that's just me thinking because i mean i am hoarse and you know i it's hard to preach when you're horse got sore throat it's almost impossible i mean singers they don't like singing when they got horse throats right any singers like to sing with a bad throat no preachers don't like preaching with a bad but we'd have thought that's just a thought but he said satan said that to me you know what he said to satan you're a liar and he said i could hardly whisper when i came to the door but i walked in anyhow because god is going to do something here tonight maybe save some soul or heal somebody and my duty is to stand here whether i can whisper or grunt god will do something anyhow because he said he would do it's our duty to take our stand it's god's duty to back us up [Music] but first you got to realize that's a devil talking to you and say devil you're a liar i wonder how many people thinks is just thoughts well if i feel like i need to stay home from church tonight you know i could be a devil i'm pretty sure it ain't god amen well i just think in that way brother no something's influencing thoughts we better move on now you know god had told the children of israel down in egypt he said i give you the land but he didn't say i'm gonna go and sweep it all out garnish the houses and we'll hang up the curtains just everything you all just move in no no they had to fight for every inch of ground they took he said fighting taking possession everywhere the soles of your feet land that is possession footsteps of possession he said the same thing today divine healing belongs to us the holy spirit belongs to us it's our property but you'll fight for every inch of it amen brother it says footsteps is possession keep fighting but the devil will come and try to put a thought it says the days of miracles are passed you say you're a liar you want to know how you talk to the devil don't debate him don't try to just you know you talk you're a liar it's all you got to say you're a liar he's because god said he's the same yesterday today and forever and if he told me i could have it it's mine hallelujah we know this know this quote brother danny used it here some time ago at one of our meetings brother brandon walking down the street going down the street turned on the radio and the broadcast wanted to talk about creation had come from just some ashes blowing together some phosphate a few chemicals and warm sunshine created the german life and brought out life he said how ridiculous he says you know when the sunshine will kill it lay it out there to just kill it out there in the sun there's no such a thing but satan was trying to punch at me and after i'd taken my little rebecca to school this morning on the road back i started to turn the radio on again and i thought i'd get back into that stuff again so i just turned it but i thought no i just turned it back off and as i was going up the street satan said to me he said do you know that this man you call jesus was just a man like one day in his day like billy graham or robert just a man began to let me know lead a few people gather around him and they begin to cry out he's a great man it became greater and then he became a god to them and now scattered all over the world and that's all there is to him what from something that he had listened to and the devil found a little entrance and it began to work in his thoughts hello somebody he'd do it to a prophet he did it to jesus you know i i i i don't know if you would if you would see it back there when jesus when he went up to the mountain to be tempted and he took himself he took him up to the high place into the temple told him if you'd have looked up there i don't think you'd have saw the devil in jesus you saw jesus but the devil was speaking to him in his mind now jesus and his being been in the realms that he could be in no doubt he could have saw him standing there you get what i'm saying if you could see that you can probably scare you to death how many spirits come by you and talk to you i mean think about it come by and haunt at you and and put these weird feelings over you and things that worry little it's spirits thoughts are influenced by spirits and they find avenues something you listen to something that you watch something that was talked about it tries to come in and it tries to bring an avenue to get down in there into that heart because if it knows it can get to the heart it's no longer a thought it's what you believe amen and he said i thought devil how a liar you are and i turned his house crossing graham street i said satan you're talking to my conscience but i'd like to ask you a few things things who was it that the hebrew prophet spoke that would come who was the anointed messiah what was upon these men who foresaw him and told his life thousands of years before he got here who wasn't foretold it just took a letter and when he called me said he was number with the transgressors and he was he was wounded for our transgressions and he was he made his grave with a rich and on rise on the third day and he did and then he promised the holy ghost and he gave it whose words was that that was written in the bible and every word is true and when i began to speak the word of god he left hallelujah just give him the word this is exactly what jesus did he didn't try to give him his thinking and his thoughts and all what he could come up with and how to argue the devil he could not argue the devil he could take him back to the word because the word that thought is higher than your thoughts oh hallelujah he can't stand the word but he's coming to try to bring you down to try to bring you down into defeat this is what even goliath would do he tried to get into the imaginations of the the children of israel and he became even greater than what he really was in their minds just as it just you know it even happened you know when caleb and joshua went into the promised land and and they come back and they said they said they everyone everybody over there is giants and and we're grasshoppers in their sight who told them that i i don't know but i have a hard time believing that one of those giants walked up to that one those one of those ten spies and tapped him on the shoulder and said hey i'm bigger than you are matter of fact you know what you look to me you look like a grasshopper no that wasn't the way it was it was in their minds it was a thought that they they began to think i bet i look like a grasshopper that dude's so big that's impossible and it became bigger than what it really was because in god's thinking it wasn't big it wasn't an impossibility well i mean and man's thinking the walls looked too great looked impossible it was no way we're gonna and god's thinking it's like what are you waiting on it's yours don't take the land this is god's thinking he's saying it's yours healing is yours deliverance what are you waiting on it's yours go take it amen it ain't oh it's so big it's so great cancer is so terrible that's our first thoughts what's given you that thought the devil goliath just he would sit there and he'd pound his chest and he would throw out his spear and look how big my spirit is boys they'd go in their tents at night and they would dream about it and in their dreams it would get bigger and bigger and taller and taller and greater and greater and for 40 days and 40 nights he stood there but there came a different set of ears into the camp he looked at that and he cast down imaginations he said my god gave me that land i don't have to bow down to that goliath and his threats how long has he been here 40 nights are you kidding me give me i'll go kill him david you're trying to make yourself into somebody you're trying to be somebody you ain't called to be you ought to go back and what do you mean i am a son of abraham i'm a god called man i'm a son of abraham and i have a right to this land he don't have a right i'll go kill him i'll trust god to back me up that's what david did he come to the place he knew where he was at and if ever david's sitting here tonight we realize you're positionally placed in christ god has confirmed it by the holy ghost i mean he has a holy ghost election calling anointing placing he elected you and confirmed it he called you he collected and called you he anointed you with the holy spirit he placed you in the body of christ each one of these davids and if you were a david where's the goliath who's the goliath brother branham that cancer that's eating you up that tumor that's hanging on them cataracts on your eye that crippled arm you know just let you in on something talking to brother ron brother tim was talking to him i might be spilling the beans i don't know but it's too good not to let go to another service you know we had the testimony of the day if he he went to the doctor here sometime get back and they told him the cancer was in his eyes we had the testimony the other day you went and there wasn't no cancer there anymore but do you know not only that he had had cataracts in his eyes the doctors said we'll have to come out when they went back in the cataracts are gone too that's our god hallelujah let me tell you when that chief of that tribe of demons falls every devil under it has to fall this is what we're witnessing the chief had made his challenge goliath of cancer made his challenge but he lost his head and when he lost his head then philistines took for the woods hallelujah and david said come on boys let's go get him amen we got some david's in the house tonight and said i'm tired of the devil coming in my mind and beat me up time after time after time i'm casting down my imagination i'm standing on the word of god and i'm holding the word of god it's truth it's gay it's amen it'll never fail he said cancer that's seeking you up those tumors that's hanging on them cataracts on your eyes that crippled arm everything looks at it and everyone looks at it and says it can't be done the devil will say you might as well quit believing how many you ever heard that thought oh guess what it wasn't you it was the devil you might as well quit believing you might as well settle down because you can't no more get well your doctor said so all the rest of them said so you can't get there but the same christ that stopped you from your drinking you're smoking you're lying you're stealing savior from a life of drunkenness and sin and the devil's grave if god can do that for you the same one can save you from your tb from your cancer he's a goliath don't take his boat stand in the name of jesus and challenge him to a showdown and he will fall oh hallelujah listen brother listen he backed him up on a sore throat cancer is nothing but a toothache spirits that comes and haunts you it's nothing to god it gets big in our own imagination but there's nothing to god it all depends on where you're looking from and how you're looking at something those 10 spies they were looking at walls like this wow you know you looked at something so high you felt like you're going to fall over backwards that's how they were they felt like they're just going to fall flat of their back it's so big it's so huge how am i going to get how are we going to caleb joshua it's impossible i think the way god looks at your problems he's got a different perspective he looks down on your adversary that mountain that you've made or you think's a mountain ain't nothing but a moe hill to god a little dust pile he can just kick it over with his feet or blow it down with his breath however he wants to do it and whatever you're dealing with is nothing to god he just needs you to believe he said when you come up for prayer listen this one you come up for prayer you need to get away from every superstition everything that i'll try to tell you the devil try to say to you will say to you well if i get called up on the platform i might get healed you see where the devil did it i might get healed get that devil away from you it doesn't matter whether you come up or not it's whether you come up with faith or not have faith in god amen when god comes on the scene all these other things don't even matter amen see you know he talks about i ain't got time to go into it but he talks about shamgar and how shamgar amen would come to those moments and his imaginations and he let his imagination go so wild until he let the enemy come year after year after year and the whole time he could have killed them on the first day the first time they came he could have took them out goliath's first sentence could have been a rock between his eyes just needed someone to believe amen he said that's he says what happens he said finally he got angry with the devil got tired of listening to him got tired of him putting it on him he said you know maybe you don't want to call it anger maybe you want to call it his righteous indignation god up he said that ought to happen to you that's on cots and stretchers and any condition this afternoon just get a little mad at the devil and say you old lying rascal you're a liar amen christ has made me free i don't have to sit like this no more whoa hallelujah listen you don't have to come service after service bound you don't have to leave bound amen christ has set you free you need to tell that devil he's a liar he tried to lie to you and tell you it's impossible for you to be saved it's not impossible he's trying to lie to you and tell you you've crossed the line no you haven't or you wouldn't even be here tonight he's trying to tell you that there's no mercy for you and there is he trying to tell you there's no grace for you and there is he's a liar amen that is the devil's thinking cast down the imagination and take the thoughts of god and say yes lord i accept it in the name of jesus don't matter what you go through what's what's going on let me go down to another find it here in the absolute pray in a prayer service he says good he said last night we had a great prayer service laying hands on the sick that's a good thing that's all it takes sometimes that's in 63 for those who want to know that's a good thing then there's some of some that there is something back there that say they didn't catch you got to get that person and find out what it is there's something hindering them something laying in the way one little shadow of vibrated away so now the little lady in there a few minutes ago she was so nervous so upset poor thing she couldn't even call to catch a breath he does a gasping sound just carrying on he said the thing you have to do here is just a little you got to catch that is catching her spirit then you're projecting to her the very thought and you change your thinking you change their thinking and when it does that you can center her back on christ from there she can go on this is what a service is for the words of god to come across the pulpit to change your thinking amen how many remembers a day your thought changed from never being saved till i am a son of god amen when your thoughts change from i can't get well till i'm healed amen it's catching your spirit amen something trying to block it there he said but it's the change of thinking and when it does that you can center him back on christ you've got to change your way of thinking she can't change it herself she's running in the world you got to pick that up now there's just something that he said don't try to study it don't do it just believe it and go home he said how could that little baby laying on that mother's arm been dead since nine o'clock that morning just to wait in the night where the where where was that little spirit you have to find it and bring it back and when you see it coming back you can rise in the name of the lord and call it and then it'll happen but till you do that you're just wasting your breath there's nothing mysterious about it it's finding god and getting yourself out of the way and let the holy spirit use you to whatever he wants to do it's only a gift it's getting your own ideas your own thinking and let christ become manifested let christ become amen move in your body hallelujah he said just as he told moses he'd give him the land he told joshua i'll give it to you but what happened their thinking had to turn towards the promise to where it wasn't just their thinking no more it became their belief and this is where caleb and joshua would come out and you could tell it wasn't what they thought no more it's what they believe caleb said we're more than able to take the land because it didn't matter what was in the way no more their thoughts have been centered on the promise that's what we have to do bring our thoughts back to the promise if your thinking is against the word of god and you don't have the seal of god you're in a dangerous position because that thinking will become belief but if there's a seal there that thought would come but that seal override that thought and cast it down you can't keep thoughts from coming you can't keep it they can't help it it's like they said birds flying over your head it just happens but you need to we need to be more cognizant and realize what's influencing that thought it's not just a thought there's a spirit behind it we want to be tuned in to that other realm to where that thinking becomes our thinking his thoughts are higher than my thoughts his ways are way past what i can come up with i wonder tonight if we could just look at it for a moment and say you know maybe i need to think about some things i've been dwelling on the wrong thing brother timothy i need to cast it aside i people can say things people can do things people can hurt your feelings people can hurt you in all kinds of ways and if you stay on that thought it'll take you down into bitterness and unbelief you'll get to a place if you stay on if somebody puts a real hurt on you and you stay on that long enough you'll get to a place that you'll believe nobody is good you'll believe nobody can help you negativity breeds negativity we want positive and what's positive it ain't just happy good luck good luck good luck thoughts that's not what i'm talking about positive is the word of god let that word be what you dwell on if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things think on these things think on the word of god you say well brother timothy i i'm trying to believe for the promise but i hadn't felt it i it doesn't matter don't put your thinking on your feelings put your thinking on the word the word promised it that's all that matters the word said it that's all that matters it's his word let's bow our heads i wonder if there be somebody here honest before god say i need my thinking changed i need my thoughts changed lord yes lord lord help me to realize what's influencing these thoughts help me to realize lord when something comes and i begin to dwell and stew and worry and fret it's a spirit cast it down yes lord hands lifted all over this building if you need to get right with god tonight tonight's the night to do it you don't have to stay in that condition you don't have to walk back home with that crutch you can leave it at the seat yes lord let our thoughts line up to your word lord your thinking is higher than our thinking your ways are higher than our ways yes lord father you've seen the hands that were lifted all over this building lord help us to turn our eyes on you completely lord to look full into your face father to your word lord god how much more sincere we need to be about the things of god as we see that time approaching lord lord we know we're very close we see judas taking the
