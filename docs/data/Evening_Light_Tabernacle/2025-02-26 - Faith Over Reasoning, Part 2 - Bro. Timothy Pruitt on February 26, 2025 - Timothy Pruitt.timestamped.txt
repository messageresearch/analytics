[31:35] commit this time to you everything to be
[31:36] said and done for your glory in Jesus
[31:40] name
[31:42] amen amen you turn to Romans chapter
[31:46] 8
[31:49] amen amen it's good to be in the house
[31:51] of the
[31:52] Lord God is so good not only is he good
[31:56] he's good all the time amen hallelujah
[31:59] it's more than just a a saying or a
[32:01] cliche it's a it's the truth amen that
[32:04] no matter what you're going through
[32:06] matter of fact you can read in Romans 8
[32:08] that all things work together for the
[32:10] good amen so whatever you're going
[32:12] through tonight or today he's he's good
[32:15] amen and he's mindful of our needs
[32:18] Romans 8 and verse 6 it says for to be
[32:21] carnally minded is death but to be
[32:24] spiritually minded is life and peace
[32:27] because the carnal mind is enmity or in
[32:30] other words at war against God for it is
[32:34] not subject to the law of God neither
[32:36] indeed can be amen we let you be
[32:46] seated just want to continue with a
[32:48] thought on faith over reasoning we spoke
[32:51] on last
[32:52] Wednesday uh just looking at this
[32:54] thought and I I loved a lot of what the
[32:58] things that brother Nathan brought on
[33:00] Sunday Kind of along these same lines
[33:02] about the ridiculous because God to the
[33:06] carnal mind is
[33:08] ridiculous uh to you know the carnal
[33:10] mind has wared with it for thousands of
[33:13] years over if there even is a God and
[33:16] and and and argue different thoughts and
[33:18] philosophies and different things but
[33:21] amen we know it takes Faith to believe
[33:23] in him and to believe his word and and
[33:25] to believe what he said is going to come
[33:27] to pass
[33:28] and we know that reasoning is brother
[33:31] brandwood said it like this he said
[33:32] reason is what started the ball of sin
[33:35] rolling in the first place reasoning
[33:38] what reasoning against the word of God
[33:40] so it wasn't just taking a thought and
[33:43] thinking about it as we do thing you
[33:44] know we think about maybe what we going
[33:46] to wear today or we reason all of that
[33:48] out or we think about that's not what
[33:50] we're talking about but reasoning that
[33:52] we're talking about is this enmity or
[33:54] this war against God and his word and
[33:57] there reasoning against the word of God
[33:59] and when God told Adam and Eve that day
[34:01] you eat thereof that day you die that
[34:04] settled it that should have been all to
[34:05] it and he fortified them against the
[34:08] enemy because he told them his word he
[34:10] said if you do this this is what's going
[34:12] to happen so so if they would have took
[34:15] him at his word they would have never a
[34:17] mean they would have never come to the
[34:18] place that they they that they came to
[34:20] and cuz he fored fortified them with his
[34:23] word but Eve by listening to Satan's
[34:26] reason and he said you know seek cult
[34:27] culture and understanding and the
[34:29] education and advancement she stepped
[34:32] behind out from behind the word and
[34:34] started listening to what Satan had to
[34:37] say and she did the very thing that God
[34:40] said don't do and if one reasoning or
[34:43] listening to One Reason against the word
[34:45] caused all this chaos one reason against
[34:48] the word again won't take you back to
[34:50] the place they were before they fell and
[34:53] so because how foolish it would be for
[34:55] God to bring back man Amen to the same
[34:58] place on the same basis he sent him out
[35:01] from he said it's got to be because you
[35:03] come by the shed blood of Jesus Christ
[35:07] amen our denominations our Creeds our
[35:09] reasonings amen it's the blood it's the
[35:11] birth it's the what produces you in you
[35:14] the new creature Christ after the
[35:16] fashion of Christ you live because the
[35:18] toxin that you take shows it kills the
[35:22] sin of unbelief against anything but the
[35:25] word of God Amen amen I I I'm thankful
[35:29] for that toxin tonight amen the word
[35:31] that or the blood that can come into
[35:33] your life amen and kill everything that
[35:36] has anything against the word of God
[35:39] Amen that's your nature your sinful
[35:41] nature your flesh amen I I just want to
[35:43] I was going to leave this out but I I
[35:45] this fits in really good here I I just
[35:47] want to read a different translation for
[35:49] a moment of Romans 8 it says now there
[35:52] is now no condemnation to those who
[35:55] belong to Christ Jesus how many belong
[35:57] to him to tonight and because you belong
[35:59] to him the power of that lifegiving
[36:02] Spirit has freed you freed you from the
[36:05] power of sin that leads to death amen so
[36:09] it's freed you he said the law of Moses
[36:11] was unable to save us because of the
[36:13] weakness of our sinful nature so God did
[36:16] what the law could not do he sent his
[36:18] own son in a body like the bodies we
[36:21] have and in that body God declared an
[36:24] end to sin's control over Us by giving
[36:27] his son as a sacrifice for our sins he
[36:30] did this so that just requirement of the
[36:32] law may be fully satisfied for us who no
[36:35] longer follow our sinful nature but
[36:38] instead we follow after the spirit this
[36:40] is Romans 8 those those who are
[36:43] dominated by the sinful nature think
[36:46] about sinful things amen those that are
[36:49] dominated by a sinful nature think about
[36:51] sinful things but those who are
[36:53] controlled by the Holy Spirit thinks
[36:56] about those things which pleases the
[36:58] spirit so letting your sinful nature
[37:01] control your mind that leads to death
[37:04] but letting the spirit control your mind
[37:07] that leads you to life and peace amen
[37:09] for the sinful nature is always hostile
[37:13] or at war with God Amen it never did
[37:16] obey God's laws and it never will that's
[37:19] why those who were under who are still
[37:21] under the control of their sinful nature
[37:23] will never please God Amen will never
[37:27] please God God and if you and but you
[37:29] are not controlled by your sinful nature
[37:32] you're controlled by the spirit if you
[37:34] have the spirit of God living on the
[37:36] inside of you I love how it just simply
[37:38] puts it amen and remember that those
[37:41] things who do those who do not have the
[37:43] spirit of Christ Living in them do not
[37:45] belong to him at all and Christ lives
[37:48] live lives lives within you so even
[37:51] though your body will die because of sin
[37:53] the spirit will give you life because
[37:55] you've been made right with God the
[37:57] spirit of God who raised up Jesus from
[37:59] the dead lives in you and just as God
[38:02] raised Christ Jesus from the dead he
[38:04] will give life to your mortal bodies by
[38:07] The Same Spirit living within you
[38:09] therefore dear brothers and sisters we
[38:11] have no obligation to do what your
[38:14] sinful nature urges you to
[38:17] do Hallelujah aren't you glad to not be
[38:20] under obligation to sinful nature no
[38:22] more amen we are not under obligation to
[38:26] do what your sinful nature urges you to
[38:28] do for if you live by its dictates you
[38:31] will die but through the power of the
[38:34] spirit you put the death the Deeds of
[38:36] your sinful nature you will live for all
[38:39] who are led by the spirit of God are the
[38:41] children of God so you have not receive
[38:44] the spirit that makes you fearful
[38:48] slaves come on now you are you have not
[38:51] received the spirit that makes you
[38:53] fearful slaves instead you receive God's
[38:56] spirit when he adopted you as his own
[39:00] children amen you received God's spirit
[39:03] when he adopted you as his own children
[39:05] now we call him Abba Father for his
[39:08] Spirit joins with our spirit to affirm
[39:11] that we're God's children and since we
[39:13] are his children we are his hirs in fact
[39:16] together with Christ we're Heirs of
[39:19] God's glory but if we are sh to share
[39:21] his glory we will also share in his
[39:24] suffering amen but it's showing very
[39:26] clearly amen men to have Amen to not
[39:29] have this sinful nature controlling you
[39:31] and controlling your thoughts and
[39:33] controlling your mind there must be a
[39:35] death to sinful nature there must be a
[39:38] death to sinful man so the spirit of God
[39:41] can live inside of you I believe that's
[39:43] what we all want amen that's what we all
[39:45] desire amen that God's spirit makes the
[39:48] dictations of our life amen a man you
[39:51] know that's in Christ Jesus walks or
[39:53] desires spiritual
[39:56] things amen the world to the world it's
[39:59] a in it's carnal mind it's a spiritual
[40:01] things are foolishness they're crazy as
[40:04] we heard on Sunday they're ridiculous
[40:06] but to those that believe them they're
[40:08] everlasting
[40:10] life how many how many believes in
[40:12] Supernatural things to those that
[40:14] believe them they are everlasting
[40:17] life you know as we go along this
[40:19] thought of foolishness or and kind of
[40:22] build a little bit on what brother
[40:23] Nathan was even speaking about on
[40:25] ridiculous when God told Noah to build
[40:28] an ark and Noah was out there building
[40:30] away on this Ark and sitting out in the
[40:32] middle of a big dry field and it would
[40:35] not been one drop of rain that had fell
[40:37] out of Heaven never been anything out of
[40:39] the heavens as rain never been a cloud
[40:40] in the sky yet Noah out there building
[40:43] away on the ark could you imagine how
[40:45] silly that looked could you imagine why
[40:48] the carnal mind that to the carnal mind
[40:50] that man was
[40:52] insane he had lost his mind he had as we
[40:55] say fell off his Rock
[40:57] yeah he he he he's done went he's he's
[41:00] he's drank something he he's done
[41:02] something he's crazy that's what they
[41:04] call he's crazy he said brother I could
[41:06] hear people coming on from work and
[41:08] they'd hear a hammer nailing the Ray on
[41:10] that Ark and say you really believe in
[41:12] that rain story they're telling out
[41:14] there what do you think about that old
[41:15] crank over there that's nailing away on
[41:17] that Ark why why he's the craziest guy
[41:20] you ever seen out there building away on
[41:22] the ark and that water's going to fall
[41:23] from Heaven that man's crazy there's
[41:26] nothing up there God 's always watered
[41:29] it a different way down here upon the
[41:30] Earth there's no such a thing as rain
[41:32] but God told him that so he can make him
[41:35] a way of Escape amen he put his word
[41:38] there for his protection and as long as
[41:41] he stayed with his word he was going to
[41:45] live amen amen as it was in the days of
[41:48] Noah so it will be in the coming of the
[41:50] son of man this is red letter words amen
[41:53] so if that's going to be so there's
[41:55] going to be a program on Earth that will
[41:57] seem crazy to a lot of people that's
[42:00] right they're going to think you're
[42:01] crazy for walking a certain way or
[42:03] living a certain way or dressing a
[42:05] certain way or having a certain mindset
[42:08] they're going to say you're crazy you
[42:10] lost your mind but it was God's program
[42:12] then it's God's program
[42:17] now and he said those same people will
[42:19] still be just building away on the ark
[42:23] that Ark is now Jesus
[42:25] Christ he amen amen people think you're
[42:29] crazy for even going to church on a
[42:30] Wednesday

[42:45] do they think you're nuts you know when
[42:48] God told Moses to speak to the Rock how
[42:51] foolish did that
[42:54] sound how crazy I mean not even the he
[42:57] told a said a rock one of the driest
[43:01] places there is and it was not only a
[43:03] dry rock it was laying in a dried
[43:06] desert
[43:08] amen we we Moses we there's no water
[43:12] around what do you mean speak to a rock
[43:14] that's the way they think they thought
[43:15] well this a bunch of craziness bunch of
[43:17] Fanatics if God's going to do something
[43:19] dry as places look like he would find a
[43:21] place that maybe had a hint of water but
[43:25] that ain't the way God works
[43:27] amen The Rock brought the waters anyway
[43:30] and it saved a perishing people that's
[43:33] right amen why because they stayed with
[43:35] the word sir amen and today that rock of
[43:39] je is Jesus Christ he has been smitten
[43:42] for you and you can also speak to him
[43:45] maybe you've been somewhere and things
[43:47] have not went right but you can today
[43:49] speak to the Rock and it'll bring forth
[43:51] Waters of Salvation it'll bring forth
[43:54] Waters of healing it'll bring forth
[43:56] Waters of deliver
[43:57] if you'll just speak to the
[44:00] Rock so well it sounds ridiculous but
[44:04] it's
[44:05] true it sounds crazy but it's real it's
[44:09] reality you know when Ahab and
[44:11] Jehoshaphat you know they was in need of
[44:14] water and they went to find the prophet
[44:15] you know they got in trouble Ahab ain't
[44:17] wanted to hear what the prophet said but
[44:19] he got in trouble then that's when he
[44:20] wants to hear what the prophet got to
[44:21] say a lot of people's that way you know
[44:23] they're okay as long as everything's
[44:24] okay but once it goes wrong then they
[44:26] want to see a preacher they want to see
[44:27] a church they want to see somebody Amen
[44:29] to give them a little
[44:31] Comfort but when they got to their
[44:33] comfort he wasn't too comfortable he was
[44:36] angry he was mad he he why you coming to
[44:38] me for anyhow why are you going to come
[44:41] now you you You' you've got 400 prophets
[44:43] down there why don't you go ask
[44:46] them and he said the prophet of God In
[44:49] Our Generation said his righteous
[44:51] indignation was up he's a little angry a
[44:54] little little tiff that morning wasn't
[44:57] happy wasn't in a good mood so you know
[45:00] he said well you going to have to we got
[45:01] to change the atmosphere bring me a
[45:03] minstral and and so he brings a minr and
[45:05] begins to play and he got in the spirit
[45:07] of God and when the spirit of God begin
[45:10] to move God begin to show him some
[45:11] things he said that's way it is you have
[45:13] to get into a spirit if you want to see
[45:17] something amen what good does it do to
[45:20] come to church if we're not going to get
[45:21] in the spirit of it if you want God to
[45:24] show you something tonight get in the
[45:26] spirit of it amen we sing the songs we
[45:28] Rejoice we we felt his presence so amen
[45:31] God ought to start showing somebody
[45:33] something if they'll get into the spirit
[45:35] of it and allow God to move through
[45:37] their lives the first thing you know
[45:39] when he got up in the spirit all of a
[45:41] sudden he raised his hands and he said
[45:43] thus sayth the Lord I want you to go dig
[45:45] a whole valley full of
[45:47] ditches what oh what valley that right
[45:51] out there in that
[45:55] desert Elisha
[45:57] I I came to get
[46:00] water amen but what happened they had
[46:03] enough sense to listen to what the
[46:04] prophet said yeah and they went and be
[46:07] to dig amen he said because if you dig
[46:10] the more the ditches that you dig will
[46:12] be filled by water in the
[46:14] morning so if they stayed with the word
[46:17] then they was going to get their
[46:18] Deliverance but if they had just
[46:20] reasoned about it and say well this is
[46:22] nuts I mean I I've heard of a lot of
[46:24] things but I we got all kind of wells
[46:26] around around here we got other but out
[46:28] in the
[46:30] desert he's lost his
[46:33] mind and I'm going to dig a hole that's
[46:36] going to be F how is it going to be fil
[46:38] it ain't up to me how it's going to be
[46:39] filled it ain't up to me how it's going
[46:42] to happen it ain't up to me how it's
[46:43] going to come to pass it's up to me to
[46:45] follow the word it's up to me to do
[46:48] exactly what he said do that's
[46:51] right it looks ridiculous to the carnal
[46:54] mind well Elisha surely if you want get
[46:57] some water surely you could tell us
[46:59] maybe a little better place to drill
[47:01] somewhere got a little Machinery we can
[47:03] come and get maybe up down close to a
[47:05] pump
[47:06] somewhere no go right out there in that
[47:09] desert cuz what was God trying to show
[47:11] them this ain't got nothing to do with
[47:14] you I'm the one that's going to produ
[47:17] you come asking me for water I'm going
[47:19] to produce the water all you got to do
[47:22] is dig a few
[47:24] ditches amen you don't have to produce
[47:27] the miracle all you got to do is prepare
[47:29] for
[47:31] it amen it ain't up to you to produce it
[47:34] it ain't up to you to bring it to pass
[47:36] it's up to you to prepare for it
[47:39] yes and say God said it I'm going to dig
[47:42] a
[47:43] ditch and you'll get to digging
[47:45] sometimes and there'll be all kinds of
[47:47] stuff in there to try to stop you he
[47:48] said he said there'd be some 10 cans
[47:50] down in there that'll rattle around and
[47:52] say days of Miracles are passed or God
[47:54] don't operate like that no more kinds of
[47:57] things reason is that try to come up he
[47:59] said what you need to do is get your
[48:01] shovel and get that tin can out and
[48:03] throw it out of the
[48:06] ditch come on somebody how many of us
[48:09] have had the same old tin cans we hit
[48:11] against service after service or time
[48:13] after time but tonight I got the shovel
[48:16] of the Holy Ghost and he's commissioned
[48:18] me to dig a ditch and where I dig he's
[48:20] going to feel it where I dig he going to
[48:23] come with his
[48:24] blessings that's right Hallelujah
[48:27] I'm doing what the prophet said tonight
[48:29] I got my shovel and I'm digging ditches
[48:33] I'm digging enough for healing I'm
[48:35] digging enough for Joy I'm digging
[48:37] enough for the Holy Ghost I'm digging
[48:39] enough for somebody to get
[48:41] [Applause]
[48:45] saved and he said after a while you're
[48:48] going to hit a rock down
[48:51] there what rock the same rock that they
[48:53] spoke to
[48:59] had been covered up by
[49:01] theologies had been covered up with
[49:03] sands of time and it seemed like it
[49:06] wouldn't happen no more and just a
[49:07] miracle we talk about or a miracle we
[49:09] used to
[49:11] see but all the problem was we got to
[49:14] get the the unbelief out of the way
[49:16] that's right come on church it's what
[49:19] we're going to do tonight we're going to
[49:20] get their unbelief out of the way and
[49:22] those Sands of Time those Sands that
[49:24] wants to blow in and say God doesn't
[49:26] still give babies to those who are who
[49:29] can't have babies God doesn't he doesn't
[49:31] heal those that are so sick and
[49:33] incurable amen we're going to dig all
[49:35] that out all those 10 cans we keep
[49:38] bumping up against and says hey you you
[49:41] know you prayed for this one and and
[49:42] they got sick and died you pray for that
[49:44] it doesn't matter we're digging it out
[49:47] cuz I know down below all that unbelief
[49:50] is the Rock of Ages and if I can ever
[49:52] get to that
[49:54] rock water spring out of it
[49:56] [Applause]
[50:00] he said we need to dig down enough so we
[50:02] can get us an old rock down there he
[50:04] said because they got those rocks out
[50:06] and they took those rocks and they went
[50:08] and stopped up the enemy's
[50:11] Wells come on now that enemy's been
[50:14] stopping up your well it's time you dig
[50:16] down enough to get something to stop up

[50:43] Ages and I'm going to grab that rock and
[50:46] I bring it into your house Satan and I'm
[50:48] going to plug your well
[50:52] up this is why you got to testify and
[50:55] thank God for all the things he done why
[50:58] is it we constantly rehearse over in our
[51:00] mind what he did for sister l or what he
[51:03] did for this one or what he did for
[51:04] somebody in another church why do we do
[51:07] that cuz it's a
[51:08] rock it's a rock of
[51:13] testimony don't you dare let the devil
[51:15] blow sands over
[51:21] it lay aside every weight and sin that's
[51:24] so easily beset you what sin
[51:27] unbelief that little thing that says it
[51:30] can't be done that little thing that
[51:32] says my well my doctor says this or that
[51:36] doctor may be right as far as he knows
[51:38] but God said
[51:41] different if thou cast believe all
[51:44] things are possible throw that out of
[51:46] the way then give a chance for the Holy
[51:48] Ghost to make his way down through the
[51:49] building tonight no matter what you've
[51:51] done though your sins be like Scarlet
[51:54] they can be made white like snow make a
[51:56] way for dig the ditches dig the ditches
[51:59] the next morning God moved in and filled
[52:02] all the ditches and they each one had
[52:03] got water the other alien Army was
[52:06] pursuing run down they took rocks in
[52:08] their hands went over to them enemies
[52:09] stopped up all their Wells wasn't that a
[52:11] wonderful Victory not only won all the
[52:14] victory but stopped up the wells them
[52:16] old stagnated ponds they was drinking in
[52:18] anyhow what we need tonight is a people
[52:21] somebody that'll dig down deep enough
[52:25] get a little salvation in the the soul
[52:27] get a victory down in there get healed
[52:29] there get saved get filled with the Holy
[52:31] Ghost and stop the mouth of some critic
[52:34] that says days of Miracles are
[52:37] passed throw the stone of faith into it
[52:41] and stop That Thing
[52:47] Up Just prayed for another young lady
[52:49] with
[52:50] alipa you know what gave me Faith to
[52:53] pray for her is because God gave us a
[52:55] stone
[52:58] right sure I mean yeah I gave me I got
[53:01] faith to believe his word that's not
[53:02] what I'm saying but I mean to have that
[53:04] stone that testimony and to tell her hey
[53:07] you're not the first person with this
[53:09] disease that's right and God healed It
[53:11] Before He'll heal it
[53:14] again that's why we keep lifting sister
[53:17] Atlanta's testimony up cuz cancer is a
[53:19] very prevalent thing apparently in the
[53:21] day that we're living in amen why it's
[53:23] showing God did it before God to do it
[53:26] again
[53:28] again that's why we keep lifting brother
[53:30] Justin's testimony up amen of a prodical
[53:33] son that came back if God did it before
[53:35] God will do it
[53:38] again amen that's why we always lift up
[53:40] the it's not about Lifting me up or
[53:42] lifting brother Tim up we didn't do it
[53:44] anyhow that's right but we did prepare
[53:47] for
[53:48] it we did preach the word of faith we
[53:51] did preach God the same yesterday today
[53:53] and forever we did preach he still heals
[53:56] he's still saved he still brings a
[53:58] prodal we still preach it we will always
[54:01] preach
[54:04] it Hallelujah we prepared for it but
[54:08] somebody
[54:13] dug Hallelujah Abraham was fully
[54:16] persuaded that God was able to keep that
[54:19] which he promised if God makes a promise
[54:22] got to keep that
[54:23] promise being fully persuaded that he
[54:27] that he would would do what he said he
[54:28] was able to perform God keeps his
[54:30] promises no matter how ridiculous it may
[54:33] have looked to the carnal mind it looked
[54:36] all right to
[54:38] Abraham cuz Abraham never looked so much
[54:41] as what the promise was or how
[54:43] ridiculous it was he looked at who gave
[54:46] the
[54:48] promise that's a big key right
[54:50] there hey man if it's your government
[54:53] giving the promise
[54:54] hey I I ain't got no problem with you
[54:57] doubting
[54:59] it you know some politician gave you the
[55:02] promise I ain't got no problem with you
[55:03] doubting
[55:04] it even if a if a preacher made the
[55:07] promise preacher is a man he can fall he
[55:10] can fail right might have reason to
[55:13] doubt
[55:14] it but we ain't the one who made the
[55:18] promise I preach it but I ain't the one
[55:20] who made it I speak it but I ain't the
[55:23] one who said it
[55:26] you understand what I'm saying I ain't
[55:28] the one who declared it in the
[55:30] beginning he said
[55:34] it come on now I mean if y'all can't see
[55:37] that even the songs were lined up
[55:38] tonight I don't know what to tell you
[55:41] stop reasoning about it just go ahead
[55:42] and believe it God's in this service and
[55:44] God's going to do something amazing yes
[55:46] sir I believe Hallelujah he said
[55:50] it he said it he said it in his word he
[55:55] declared it was there all I am is a
[55:57] microphone saying it
[56:03] yes when he told the disciples to let
[56:05] down the net and take up for the drought
[56:09] or for the big
[56:11] catch they've been fishing they were
[56:13] fishermen they had this figured out from
[56:15] a long time ago it was foolish uh hello
[56:20] there's no fish
[56:23] there I got my lives scop
[56:30] they didn't even have Liv Scopes in that
[56:32] day but they they knew enough about
[56:33] fishing they done fished
[56:35] it but you just know it's kind of funny
[56:38] how Technologies Advance kind of along
[56:41] with the
[56:41] reasonings yeah and unbelief you know
[56:44] today we got what's called a Liv scope
[56:47] it's incredible you can actually go up
[56:49] to a a bush somewhere find this bush in
[56:52] the middle of the lake with this
[56:54] livescope it show you all the branches
[56:56] it'll show you all the little limbs
[56:58] coming out it'll show you the fish
[57:00] swimming around it and then you can drop
[57:03] your little bait down in there and it'll
[57:06] show you drop it right down on that
[57:08] fish's nose now you can't make that fish
[57:11] bite of course that fish got his own
[57:12] mind but if you just twitch it a little
[57:14] bit and if he's hungry enough he going
[57:16] and you'll see it grab it and then
[57:19] you'll feel it pull it and then you'll
[57:21] pull that fish up well that's quite a
[57:23] deal ain't it that's the way we we want
[57:26] our
[57:28] religion we want to see
[57:31] it we see the problem we see the issue
[57:34] we see the devil sitting there we see
[57:36] all these things and we know exactly how
[57:38] to go around this way or going we ain't
[57:39] got that
[57:42] ability amen we don't have that ability
[57:45] all we can do in this hour is depend on
[57:48] what he said and I don't mean to say
[57:50] that in some kind of light manner amen
[57:52] that's a lot there it ain't just all we
[57:55] got it's it's everything we have amen
[57:59] it's to depend on what he has said and
[58:02] if he said it he's going to bring it to
[58:06] pass well there's no fish there but God
[58:10] had put fish there for his word spoke it
[58:15] there what they failed to realize is
[58:17] when he said put down your net for the
[58:20] drought that was a creative Force
[58:26] hello can we we enough faith in the
[58:29] building to believe for that right now
[58:30] it was a creative force that spoke and
[58:33] they didn't realize by the time they'
[58:35] taken up the net before and he spoke
[58:37] there was fish created there and not
[58:40] just one
[58:42] fish come on somebody not just two not
[58:46] just 10 enough to sink their
[58:50] boat I love how it said Sunday he's the
[58:53] god of the
[58:54] ridiculous and me not would he just give
[58:57] them enough for their food or for a meal
[58:59] he gave them more than enough he was
[59:02] showing them Jehovah Gyra is standing in
[59:05] front of
[59:07] you and I have the creative word and I
[59:10] speak it and it comes to
[59:15] pass but
[59:17] nevertheless thankfully had somebody had
[59:19] enough reason or sense or mind or faith
[59:23] whatever whatever it was that said
[59:25] nevertheless
[59:26] at your word we're going to cast it
[59:30] down I mean to me looking at it it
[59:32] doesn't sound real faith faith building
[59:35] sentence God I believe
[59:38] you you said it I'm going to throw it
[59:40] down well nevertheless at Thy word see
[59:44] even in your doubt God has still come
[59:47] through if you'll just do what he said
[59:50] to do and you may not can fully
[59:52] comprehend it you may not can fully put
[59:54] it all the numbers together and make it
[59:56] all add up but if you'll just do what he
[59:59] said you to do God will fulfill his
[1:00:08] word sometimes God's way are so hard for
[1:00:13] the human mind to comprehend you just
[1:00:15] think that it's ridiculous faith is
[1:00:18] ridiculous to the carnal mind it's crazy
[1:00:21] to anything except God and the one who
[1:00:24] has the faith that's one of my favorite
[1:00:27] quotes it's crazy to anyone except God
[1:00:31] and to the one who has the
[1:00:34] faith then by faith we see we believe
[1:00:37] things that are with our eyes our mind
[1:00:40] does not declare just because but we
[1:00:42] believe it anyhow reasoning well it
[1:00:45] would never reason to be right so we
[1:00:48] can't reason it out study it out we
[1:00:50] can't just it'll just only muddle our
[1:00:52] minds up
[1:00:54] more hello does that not happen to
[1:00:57] anybody I don't know about maybe I just
[1:00:59] speak for myself I when I get to
[1:01:01] thinking about
[1:01:03] eternity you talking about muddling your
[1:01:05] mind up trying to get to the end of
[1:01:09] Eternity that's what our human abilities
[1:01:11] are we got you know we got the end of
[1:01:13] something it's the end of the service
[1:01:14] coming up it's the end of the month
[1:01:16] coming up it's the end of that ain't no
[1:01:18] end so this mind cannot comprehend that
[1:01:22] and if you're not careful all of a
[1:01:24] sudden you'll realize I'm doubting it
[1:01:27] trying to reason it all out and figure
[1:01:29] it all out all I know is I want to be
[1:01:32] there there you
[1:01:35] go I mean men have searched for the
[1:01:37] Fountain of Youth we've read about in
[1:01:39] the history books we we've read about
[1:01:41] great uh great men that have searched
[1:01:43] all over for the Fountain of Youth and
[1:01:44] they wanted the Fountain of Youth and
[1:01:46] still live in this
[1:01:48] world could you imagine somebody that
[1:01:51] was live that had founded somehow in in
[1:01:53] the 1600s and was still living to David
[1:01:55] because they took some mystical drink
[1:01:58] boy they said man I messed
[1:02:03] up but think about it that we're not
[1:02:06] going to be living in these bodies or in
[1:02:09] this world come on I don't know about
[1:02:12] you but I wouldn't mind 10 minutes
[1:02:14] without anxiety or just 10 minutes
[1:02:16] without fear can you imagine what it's
[1:02:18] going to be like when fear and anxiety
[1:02:21] and all of that's gone forever
[1:02:27] Hallelujah can you imagine we would not
[1:02:29] have another prayer request for somebody
[1:02:32] with cancer or somebody's son that's W
[1:02:34] away Somebody's Daughter that's went out
[1:02:36] we'll never have that again nothing but
[1:02:39] perfect love and peace Hallelujah I
[1:02:42] don't know about you but I plan on and
[1:02:44] living there I am looking forward to it
[1:02:47] even though I can't explain
[1:02:52] it I want to be there
[1:02:56] I would miss it for the
[1:03:00] world some of y'all catch that Monday or
[1:03:04] somewhere reasoning well just figure
[1:03:08] this out you look think about it we got
[1:03:10] and it just muddles everything
[1:03:13] up listen there's some things in our
[1:03:15] mind that'll never be fixed until we get
[1:03:18] over there there's some questions
[1:03:20] that'll never be answered till you get
[1:03:23] over there
[1:03:25] we want qu we want questions answered
[1:03:27] right you know we're we're in a a time
[1:03:30] of right away kind of mentality we yeah
[1:03:33] if we can't come up with it by talking
[1:03:35] to brother Joe or brother Aon and Google
[1:03:38] it we got to have
[1:03:40] answers Google it got to have knowledge
[1:03:44] Google it and it's under this
[1:03:47] mentality constant force of knowledge
[1:03:51] and thoughts and thinking and we're
[1:03:54] thinking about this and we're thinking
[1:03:56] about we think about stuff in 10 minutes
[1:03:58] most people didn't think about in 10
[1:04:01] hours it's the way our mind and our our
[1:04:03] our our our our our world that we live
[1:04:05] in is so
[1:04:06] Advanced that people used to enjoy just
[1:04:09] sitting out on the porch for a little
[1:04:10] bit or going out and tending their cows
[1:04:12] or cabbage or whatever they was doing
[1:04:14] and that's all their mind was on their
[1:04:16] mind was not on somebody even five miles
[1:04:18] generally away from them unless they
[1:04:20] heard about some trouble or or something
[1:04:21] they definitely wasn't thinking about
[1:04:23] anything going on around the world
[1:04:25] exactly but today in five minutes of
[1:04:28] getting up and drinking your coffee you
[1:04:29] can get this news update that news
[1:04:31] update this over here and that over here
[1:04:32] and this over and we're all stirred up
[1:04:34] and
[1:04:37] worried well how is this all going to
[1:04:40] happen how is this all going to take
[1:04:42] place ah I thought I thought that woman
[1:04:44] was going to I thought Trump he's going
[1:04:46] I
[1:04:48] thought what are you worried about it
[1:04:51] for why don't you just start singing the
[1:04:53] song this world is not my home
[1:04:56] yeah I'm just passing through that's it
[1:05:00] my treasures are laid up somewhere
[1:05:03] beyond the
[1:05:04] blue the Angels beckon
[1:05:08] me come on now but our minds are so tore
[1:05:12] up because we're thinking he says well
[1:05:14] we're we're living in a modern time he
[1:05:16] said keep that out of your
[1:05:18] mind wow that one kind of struck me
[1:05:21] today we're living in a modern time keep
[1:05:24] that out of your mind don't even take
[1:05:26] the second thought thought well how
[1:05:28] could this be how the just take him at
[1:05:31] his
[1:05:32] word that's what God says got to keep it
[1:05:35] it's not my business to figure it out
[1:05:37] because if I do I'm working then in
[1:05:39] intellectual Realms and God doesn't move
[1:05:42] in the head he moves in the
[1:05:48] heart we get so many things in our mind
[1:05:51] and we want questions answered right
[1:05:53] away and there's going to be some
[1:05:55] questions I said won't be answered till
[1:05:57] we get on the other side but there's a
[1:05:58] quote in Mother's Day that I I listen to
[1:06:00] and I look at a lot brother Brown talks
[1:06:03] about one day he said we're going to be
[1:06:04] sitting there and those tender hand of
[1:06:06] Jehovah will come by with those tender
[1:06:08] hands and he'll unravel all the knots in
[1:06:10] our
[1:06:15] mind why didn't this happen why ain't I
[1:06:18] been able to do this why ain't this went
[1:06:20] down the way I thought it would why
[1:06:21] ain't that God's Got A Plan do you trust
[1:06:24] in his plan or you're not trust in his
[1:06:27] plan the carnal mind doesn't get it but
[1:06:31] where the carnal mind lacks the
[1:06:33] spiritual mind can pick it up it can
[1:06:36] pick up the word of God it's what he
[1:06:38] said he said be not conformed to the
[1:06:40] world but be you transformed by the
[1:06:43] renewing of your mind what is the
[1:06:45] renewing of your mind 1 Corinthians 2
[1:06:47] and6 how be it we speak wisdom among
[1:06:50] them that are perfect not the wisdom of
[1:06:51] this world nor the princes of this world
[1:06:53] that come to not hello their wisdom that
[1:06:57] they thought they had everything figured
[1:06:59] out it's nothing today is what he's
[1:07:00] saying and we speak the wisdom of God in
[1:07:03] a mystery even the hidden wisdom which
[1:07:04] God ordained before the world unto our
[1:07:06] Glory which is none which none of the
[1:07:08] princes of this world knew for had they
[1:07:10] have known it they would not have
[1:07:13] crucified the Lord Of Glory so their
[1:07:16] reasonings crucified the Lord Of Glory
[1:07:19] their wisdom and their thoughts actually
[1:07:21] brought forth the crucifixion of our
[1:07:24] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:26] and so it's happening today men's
[1:07:29] reasonings towards the word and towards
[1:07:32] the things of God is actually crucifying
[1:07:34] Christ
[1:07:37] again he said but none of the princes
[1:07:39] would have knew for had they known they
[1:07:40] would not have crucified the Lord Of
[1:07:41] Glory but as it is written I hath Not
[1:07:44] Seen Nor Ear heard you want to think
[1:07:47] about eternity think about this eyes
[1:07:49] have not seen nor ears heard neither
[1:07:51] have entered into the heart of man the
[1:07:53] things which God has prepared for them
[1:07:56] that love
[1:07:58] him did you tell did you see where he
[1:08:00] put that he put it in the heart of man
[1:08:03] he didn't saying the mind of man he said
[1:08:05] the heart of man he said so the things
[1:08:07] that are re already up there and look
[1:08:10] and waiting on us that eyes have not
[1:08:11] seen nor ears have heard have not even
[1:08:14] been fully understood by a spiritual
[1:08:17] Heart by the heart of man much less the
[1:08:20] mind of
[1:08:24] man but God hath revealed them unto us
[1:08:28] by his spirit for the spirit searches
[1:08:30] all things yay the Deep things of God
[1:08:33] for what man knoweth the things of a man
[1:08:34] say the spirit of man which is in him
[1:08:36] even so the things of God knoweth no man
[1:08:38] but the spirit of God but now we have
[1:08:41] receive not the spirit of the world but
[1:08:43] the spirit which is of god that we might
[1:08:45] know the things that we are freely given
[1:08:47] to us of God which things also we speak
[1:08:50] not in the words of man's Wisdom teach
[1:08:52] us but with the Holy Ghost teach us
[1:08:54] comparing spiritual things with
[1:08:55] spiritual but the natural man receiveth
[1:08:57] not the things of the spirit of God for
[1:09:00] they are not are they foolish unto him
[1:09:02] neither can he know them because because
[1:09:04] they are spiritually discerned but he
[1:09:07] that is spiritual judges all things yet
[1:09:09] he himself is Judge of no man for who
[1:09:12] hath known the mind of the Lord that he
[1:09:14] may instruct him but we have the mind of
[1:09:19] Christ let this mind be in you which was
[1:09:22] also in Christ Jesus
[1:09:26] amen so be
[1:09:28] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:09:33] let the mind of Christ take over and you
[1:09:35] can only let the mind of Christ taken
[1:09:36] over by having the spirit of
[1:09:39] Christ God is so easily though to be
[1:09:42] misunderstood by
[1:09:45] unbelievers by those who can't
[1:09:48] understand or maybe don't even want to
[1:09:50] understand many people try to understand
[1:09:52] but many don't even want to they just
[1:09:55] shut themselves up and say well there's
[1:09:56] no such a thing I don't believe in such
[1:09:59] that then then they'll never understand
[1:10:00] it but a man that's willing to
[1:10:03] understand that's willing to sit down
[1:10:05] Bible says come let us reason together
[1:10:07] now that man is on the line of learning
[1:10:10] something from the Lord but people who
[1:10:12] are always associated with God and God's
[1:10:14] power you can hardly be associated with
[1:10:16] god without being associated with his
[1:10:18] power because when you're associated
[1:10:19] with him you're acquainted to him or
[1:10:21] you're a relative of him then you have
[1:10:23] his power in you that's the reason
[1:10:25] reason that people cannot believe in
[1:10:27] miracles today because they don't have
[1:10:29] anything in them to believe
[1:10:32] with well we're not in the season of
[1:10:34] Miracles no you're in the season of not
[1:10:40] believing you're in the season of doubts
[1:10:44] you're in the season of not being filled
[1:10:45] with the Holy Ghost that's what he said
[1:10:49] you're in the season of not being filled
[1:10:50] with the Holy Ghost cuz you can only
[1:10:52] know him by a spiritual understanding
[1:10:57] ing you can hardly be Associated I love
[1:11:00] that without with god without being
[1:11:01] associated with his power that's the
[1:11:04] reason people cannot believe in miracles
[1:11:06] because they don't have anything to
[1:11:07] believe with they haven't got something
[1:11:09] here to believe with and when the spirit
[1:11:10] of God is in a man he'll say Amen to
[1:11:13] every word of God and every miracle of
[1:11:16] God hello but as my mother used to say
[1:11:19] you can't get blood from a turnup
[1:11:21] because there's no blood in it that's
[1:11:23] the same way you can't get belief of
[1:11:27] unbeliever that's just what he is he's
[1:11:29] an unbeliever is what he said a man came
[1:11:32] to us I don't believe in Divine Healing
[1:11:33] no matter what you say certainly is not
[1:11:35] for you right I could try I could show
[1:11:39] you every case that's ever been done and
[1:11:41] you still wouldn't
[1:11:44] believe how many
[1:11:46] miracles did they did Jesus do and they
[1:11:49] still wouldn't believe
[1:11:51] him what what calls them their unbelief
[1:11:53] reasoning
[1:11:55] well I mean you know hey you know if
[1:11:57] this this was this can't be God God
[1:11:59] wouldn't come in a a form of a man he's
[1:12:02] holy he's righteous he's he wouldn't
[1:12:05] come we know where he was born I mean he
[1:12:08] was born in a did you hear he was born
[1:12:10] in a cattle stall there's no way God
[1:12:13] would come that way these people are
[1:12:16] lost their minds they're crazy if God
[1:12:18] would have come he would have rolled out
[1:12:20] the carpet and red carpet purple carpet
[1:12:23] some kind of carpet and come right down
[1:12:24] into Caiaphas High Temple and said here
[1:12:27] I
[1:12:28] am that ain't the way God come and he
[1:12:31] was misunderstood he was missed because
[1:12:34] God why man was looking at him with his
[1:12:36] own intellectual understanding when when
[1:12:40] when when Nicodemus come to him he tried
[1:12:42] he he was trying to understand but then
[1:12:45] Jesus said a man must be born again what
[1:12:48] did he go to to his intellectual
[1:12:51] understanding well I mean you mean he's
[1:12:54] got to go back in his mother's womb and
[1:12:56] go through all that again this don't
[1:12:58] make
[1:13:00] sense intellectual understanding trying
[1:13:04] to make it all add up trying to make it
[1:13:06] all just figure it all out get all the
[1:13:09] ones together and all the twos together
[1:13:11] and all the threes together you know I'm
[1:13:13] I I'm just going to put this out I'm
[1:13:15] sorry if somebody here is like that but
[1:13:18] I have a hard time with people that's
[1:13:19] got to have all those things all dotted
[1:13:22] and put together and everything's got to
[1:13:24] be perfect I see smes happening already
[1:13:27] God bless
[1:13:30] you takes all kinds to make the world go
[1:13:34] around got to have it all figured
[1:13:37] out what they call it ad HD or something
[1:13:43] OCD lld DS or something
[1:13:50] phds got to have it all just
[1:13:54] perfect there's Deliverance for that too
[1:13:56] they got to have it all just
[1:13:58] right they got to have it all you know
[1:14:01] if one little picture is off a little
[1:14:03] bit just drives them
[1:14:05] crazy I know there's I don't even know
[1:14:07] why I'm on this line but there's some of
[1:14:08] y'all that look at this platform and all
[1:14:10] you see is what's wrong with
[1:14:13] it instead of what's being right with it
[1:14:17] that's what I'm trying to say Amen
[1:14:18] people get so in their minds about and
[1:14:21] that's where Satan gets them all muddled
[1:14:23] up he wants to point out all the negativ
[1:14:25] ity and all the wrong and all this and
[1:14:27] this is out of order and that's this
[1:14:28] that the other and he gets them all mled
[1:14:30] up and the meanwhile Jesus is walking
[1:14:33] through the room oh man that's right and
[1:14:36] they get all tore up cuz he didn't come
[1:14:38] like he thought he was going to come and
[1:14:39] he didn't do what he thought they
[1:14:41] thought he said he was going to do he
[1:14:42] was going to Deliver Us from the Romans
[1:14:44] that's what he said he was going to do
[1:14:45] and meanwhile that ain't why he came he
[1:14:47] came to deliver him from the power of
[1:14:50] sin and death it was a greater death
[1:14:53] than the Romans could ever give them
[1:14:55] [Applause]
[1:14:56] and if it was a greater death that he
[1:14:58] delivered him from it was a greater
[1:15:01] [Applause]
[1:15:02] Victory and he could ever do by
[1:15:05] delivering them from some Romans because
[1:15:07] listen he could have delivered them from
[1:15:09] the Romans and he could have died and
[1:15:12] went away and it have been somebody else
[1:15:14] that rose
[1:15:15] up it wasn't about being delivered from
[1:15:19] Romans it's about being delivered from
[1:15:21] sin and
[1:15:22] death and being able to put his own life
[1:15:25] into somebody so they could also know
[1:15:27] what it's like to be able to walk above
[1:15:29] it to be able to talk above it to be
[1:15:32] able to live above sin and death people
[1:15:35] are misunderstood no as we said
[1:15:38] misunderstood what do you mean rain
[1:15:41] crazy lost your mind we may not can
[1:15:44] comprehend that today because we live in
[1:15:45] the place we get plenty of rain but not
[1:15:48] in that
[1:15:49] day wasn't just an area that didn't get
[1:15:52] rain the world didn't get rain
[1:15:57] Elijah
[1:16:00] misunderstood Daniel
[1:16:03] misunderstood Shadrach mesach and
[1:16:05] Abednego
[1:16:07] misunderstood all the prophets in the
[1:16:09] Old Testament rose up and prophesied and
[1:16:12] would speak the word
[1:16:15] misunderstood the the Magi that came to
[1:16:18] see Jesus were
[1:16:20] misunderstood Jesus when he walked here
[1:16:22] on the earth he was misunderstood
[1:16:26] amen Paul was misunderstood and all the
[1:16:29] all the ones down through the Dark Ages
[1:16:31] misunderstood why won't you just say
[1:16:34] deny him and you can
[1:16:39] live can't you just reason that can't
[1:16:42] you but they knew if they did it was a
[1:16:45] greater
[1:16:46] death but if they didn't it was a
[1:16:49] greater
[1:16:51] life this is where Satan's trying to get
[1:16:53] us through a swap amen a greater death
[1:16:56] for a greater life this is what he did
[1:16:58] to Heath she swapped a greater life for
[1:17:01] a greater
[1:17:03] death this is what he tries to do he
[1:17:05] tries to make young people swap out
[1:17:07] something that that's so insignificant
[1:17:09] for something amen that that that was so
[1:17:12] great they could have had right and they
[1:17:15] swapped it out and they took things
[1:17:17] something that was so
[1:17:19] insignificant that generally caused them
[1:17:21] more problems and more heartaches more
[1:17:24] pain and more suffering if they wouldn't
[1:17:26] have just swapped that moment with Jesus
[1:17:29] and for Jesus to come into their heart
[1:17:32] and to change them forever that had just
[1:17:35] took
[1:17:36] that and took it to their heart and said
[1:17:40] God whatever it takes let me just die to
[1:17:43] my ways and to what I've done let me
[1:17:46] live for you but they swapped it for
[1:17:49] just a few moments of
[1:17:51] pleasure and it leads to Greater
[1:17:53] heartache and leads to to Greater
[1:17:55] troubles leads to Greater problems and
[1:17:57] leads to Greater issues and they had a
[1:18:05] chance but people get
[1:18:12] misunderstood brother Brown was talking
[1:18:14] about a woman that was in a in in in in
[1:18:16] a hospit doctor's office he actually
[1:18:18] happened to be in the room next door and
[1:18:20] she didn't know it and the doctor didn't
[1:18:21] either but she had been in one of his
[1:18:23] meetings and been pray for for a a big
[1:18:26] Gorder or something on her big tomb or
[1:18:28] something that was out out of her you
[1:18:30] know growing out of way out very
[1:18:33] noticeable and the doctor he wanted to
[1:18:35] know what become of the growth she said
[1:18:38] well there's a man by the name of
[1:18:39] brother brandham who prayed for me and
[1:18:41] the Lord healed me he said well I don't
[1:18:43] believe that I could never believe
[1:18:45] anything like that tell me who took it
[1:18:47] off she said you show me the
[1:18:52] scar so what did you put on it to get
[1:18:54] rid of the scar she said nothing at
[1:18:57] all he just called me out in a meeting
[1:18:59] and the thing
[1:19:01] left and he said I was sitting in the
[1:19:03] Next Room that's right sitting right
[1:19:04] there listening she didn't know I was
[1:19:05] there and he didn't know I was there
[1:19:07] because he didn't even know me anyhow
[1:19:09] and anyway take you know going down he
[1:19:13] says he said well I don't believe one
[1:19:15] word of it said I I've never seen
[1:19:16] anything yet that could do anything like
[1:19:18] that I just don't believe it I I I got
[1:19:21] to see it before I believe it she said
[1:19:23] well what about my growth
[1:19:25] he said I'd have to see it Le before I
[1:19:27] believe it but see seeing is not
[1:19:29] believing faith is a substance of things
[1:19:32] you don't
[1:19:32] see so you believe it first and then it
[1:19:37] happens amen so a man was not a Believer
[1:19:40] so therefore it was all mystery to him
[1:19:42] he didn't know what he was talking about
[1:19:44] because he couldn't understand it it was
[1:19:46] nothing but a riddle people to say
[1:19:48] people today say well I don't believe in
[1:19:49] Divine Healing I don't believe in the
[1:19:51] Holy Ghost I don't believe in speaking
[1:19:53] in tongues I don't I don't believe in
[1:19:55] shouting I don't believe in all of that
[1:19:57] I don't believe in it why it's a mystery
[1:19:59] to them it's just you're just
[1:20:02] misunderstood and but it's God here in
[1:20:05] in his Bible is what it says here is
[1:20:07] bringing the same results that the Bible
[1:20:09] spoke of bringing then it's got to be
[1:20:11] God you just misst understanded that's
[1:20:14] all God is always
[1:20:19] misunderstood his disciples couldn't
[1:20:21] understand his miracles what manner of
[1:20:23] man is this that even the winds and the
[1:20:25] waves obey him they misunderstood he
[1:20:29] wasn't just a man he was
[1:20:32] God he that's what's a matter with a lot
[1:20:34] of lot of people they wanted to make him
[1:20:36] a little M mascot boy something that
[1:20:39] maybe carries a bad every once in a
[1:20:41] while they wanted to make him just a
[1:20:42] little fellow around the camp he wasn't
[1:20:44] just a little fellow around the
[1:20:46] camp I like that brother brand had a way
[1:20:49] of putting stuff said he was Jehovah God
[1:20:52] they misunderstood it they expected him
[1:20:54] to be just one of them he wasn't just
[1:20:56] one of them he was God among them he was
[1:20:59] more than a man as I've often said he
[1:21:00] was a man when he's hungry but he was
[1:21:02] God when he fed 5,000 he was a man when
[1:21:05] his tired in the back of a boat but he
[1:21:07] was God when he ceased the winds and
[1:21:09] waves what manner of man is this he
[1:21:11] wasn't a manner of man he was God
[1:21:13] manifested in a
[1:21:16] man but they misunderstood it they
[1:21:18] thought him to be just Mary's son a
[1:21:19] carpenter but he was God manifested in
[1:21:22] flesh the Roman soldiers they
[1:21:24] misunderstood it for sure they would not
[1:21:26] have crucified him or spit on him or hit
[1:21:29] him or or lashed him with 40 Lashes they
[1:21:32] misunderstood amen they misunderstood
[1:21:34] him all through his whole life amen
[1:21:37] every one of them trying to find a spot
[1:21:40] here go on down he said even the devil
[1:21:44] misunderstood
[1:21:46] him surely that that cannot be the Son
[1:21:49] of God he wouldn't stand there and be
[1:21:52] mistreated like that them cussing him
[1:21:55] and disciples treating him and walking
[1:21:57] away that can't be God he said if he
[1:22:01] would not have misunderstood that he
[1:22:03] would not have allowed him to go to the
[1:22:07] Cross cuz he knew if he
[1:22:10] died all was lost for
[1:22:14] Satan but the
[1:22:16] thief on his left misunderstood him but
[1:22:18] the thief on his right understood said
[1:22:21] we've done evil we deserve what we get
[1:22:24] what what we're getting but this man has
[1:22:26] done nothing Lord remember me when you
[1:22:29] come in your
[1:22:31] kingdom watch that voice come back and
[1:22:33] say today Thou shalt be with me in
[1:22:36] Paradise he understood that God was
[1:22:39] dying for our sins that was the only way
[1:22:41] he could die he had to be put to death
[1:22:44] amen he understood it people have been
[1:22:46] misunderstood all all all through
[1:22:49] time he said watch you watch how when
[1:22:53] the word comes into the Church in the
[1:22:55] day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost was
[1:22:58] misunderstood and he said he's
[1:22:59] misunderstood
[1:23:01] today misunderstood today people
[1:23:03] misunderstand today May misunderstand
[1:23:05] the power of the Holy Spirit they call
[1:23:07] it a bunch of Holy Rollers they call it
[1:23:09] a bunch of people that ain't in the
[1:23:10] right mind they misunderstood they
[1:23:12] misunderstand that you have to lose what
[1:23:14] you call your right mind that to call
[1:23:17] yourself Christ because you have to have
[1:23:19] the mind of Christ in
[1:23:21] you you have to have it amen one's
[1:23:25] carnal the other's spiritual one walks
[1:23:27] after the flesh one walks after the
[1:23:29] spirit it's not you they misunderstand
[1:23:32] it's the Holy Spirit that's in you they
[1:23:37] misunderstand they might call you
[1:23:39] somebody they might say something about
[1:23:41] you speaking in his tongues or or or
[1:23:42] dancing in the spirit or or or whatever
[1:23:45] amen but it's not you they're
[1:23:46] misunderstanding it is God their
[1:23:51] misunderstanding we get on we get to a
[1:23:53] place
[1:23:55] we got to have it all figured out we got
[1:23:58] to have it all you know just
[1:24:02] right but the thing you got to come to
[1:24:04] is
[1:24:05] Lord I can't get it all figured out
[1:24:09] that's but one thing I can do is trust
[1:24:14] you one thing I can do is say God you're
[1:24:19] in
[1:24:20] control I don't know how it's going to
[1:24:22] happen I don't know how it's going to
[1:24:24] work out I just don't want to go by my
[1:24:27] own thinking no more that's right I got
[1:24:29] myself in a lot of trouble going by my
[1:24:31] own thinking and what I thought I ought
[1:24:33] to be and what I thought I ought to do
[1:24:35] but today God I want it to be your mind
[1:24:37] than me that's right let's bow our
[1:24:50] hearts brother brandom said like this he
[1:24:53] said we wasn't nothing but but a
[1:24:55] knead there was nothing to us we were
[1:24:59] all dead in sins and trespasses we were
[1:25:02] in all kinds of conditions but then we
[1:25:06] now can prostrate ourselves and give
[1:25:08] ourselves up until God takes his
[1:25:11] transfusion tube the name of Jesus
[1:25:14] Christ because there's not another name
[1:25:16] under Heaven whereby men can be saved
[1:25:18] and transfer the Life of Christ into us
[1:25:22] then we can have this kind of faith the
[1:25:25] same Faith Christ
[1:25:28] had Christ's Faith was not based on
[1:25:30] those Pharisees or sades on their pots
[1:25:33] or kettles or pans or washing feet and
[1:25:36] this that and the other was based on the
[1:25:38] word of God so much un Christ was the
[1:25:40] word the word was made flesh and then
[1:25:42] when we can get so transfused by his
[1:25:44] power that we die to our own thinking
[1:25:47] and our faith becomes that genuine faith
[1:25:49] in the Life of Christ is transfused into
[1:25:52] us and we become living creatures of God
[1:25:54] a dwelling place for the holy spirit
[1:25:56] that they now send his radiant blessings
[1:25:58] down through every part and we are the
[1:26:01] statue of
[1:26:03] Christ that's what we
[1:26:07] desire I'm going to me to say Lord
[1:26:09] tonight I want the mind of
[1:26:10] Christ I don't want to lean into my own
[1:26:13] understanding I I don't want to lean
[1:26:15] into my own
[1:26:17] thinking way I think it ought to be or
[1:26:19] way I think it ought to happen but Lord
[1:26:22] I want your life I want your peace I
[1:26:26] want your joy I want to dig out that old
[1:26:29] sand that has moved over that promise
[1:26:31] dig it out tonight get back down to that

[1:26:51] trouble doing my own thinking and my own
[1:26:52] mind and relying on my own ability
[1:26:54] abilities but Lord if we could just let
[1:26:57] go and let God have his
[1:26:59] way let the mind of Christ let there be
[1:27:01] a renewing of the mind of Christ in our
[1:27:05] hearts Lord that you can come and take
[1:27:07] complete
[1:27:09] control move through every fiber the
[1:27:12] every
[1:27:14] being Lord you saw each hand Lord we're
[1:27:17] all humans Lord we we get so we're so
[1:27:21] frail sometimes but sometimes we think
[1:27:24] was so big that we could figure you out
[1:27:26] or figure our own life out or figure out
[1:27:29] how we're going to do this or that just
[1:27:32] get all muddled up tore up and Tangled
