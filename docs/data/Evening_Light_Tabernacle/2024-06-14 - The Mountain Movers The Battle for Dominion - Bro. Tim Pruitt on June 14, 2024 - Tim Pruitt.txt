ours amen we're people of of God's blessings aren't we and we're thankful for him amen turn with me to Matthew 17:14 and one day had come to the multitude there came to him a certain man kneeling down to him and saying Lord have mercy on my son for he is a lunatic and sorely vexed for often time he falleth Into the Fire and often into the water and I brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure him then Jesus answered and said oh faithless and perverse generation how long shall I be with you how long shall I suffer you bring him hither to me and Jesus rebuked the devil and he departed out of him and the child was cured from that very hour then came the disciples to Jesus apart and said why could we not cast him out and Jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verely I say un to you if you had Faith as the grain of mustard seed you shall say unto this mountain remove hint To Yonder place and he shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you amen so God bless you as you're seated I also want to read another scripture here to preface the one that we did from Matthew chap 10 verse 5 and I I want to read this one because it will give you the setting a little bit for this scripture that we have just read where the disciples here were in a battle and they were in battle with demonic powers and they they uh failed to cast out the devil that had been there that had opposed them and Jesus of course came and and he cast him out but let's look at Matthew chap 10 and verse 5 and I want to read from there that these 12 that Jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go not into the way of the Gentiles or into any city of the Samaritans enter you not but go ye go rather to the lost sheep of the House of Israel and as you go preach saying the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand watch what he tells them now heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the Dead cast out devils and as freely as you re received freely give so you know as we read the scripture today I'm going to be taking a text on the mountain movers the battle for Dominion because the disciples here were in the battle for dominion over powers of darkness and yet Jesus had given them a word and given them the power and gave them the commandment and said go preach go demonstrate the gospel and declare that there's a kingdom coming now of course in order for one king om to come there has to be the overthrow of another and so there would be a Clashing of Kingdoms and the clashings of power so there would be battles that would go on in order to possess um and to set in the kingdom of heaven and of course the Kingdom of Heaven um understand is the Holy Ghost it's the believer's realm in the Holy Ghost and so he was saying the Holy Ghost is coming but even as a precursor to its coming as it is pressing down you we we're going to see Satan's kingdom interrupted and we're going to see it Disturbed and we're going to do it by Healing The Sick we're going to do it by cleansing the leopard by raising the dead by casting out Devils we're going to go into Satan's dominion and we're going to take control and and exercise power over his realm and so the disciples had been given Dominion by Jesus himself and had battled this demon and could not cast him out now in Mark chapter n the same story is told with more details and in verse 14 it said when the disciples he came to his disciples he saw a great multitude around them and the scribes questioning him now these scribes were the ones who were the the the writers of the law they knew the law they knew the the scriptures and now they were using scriptures to challenge what they were doing and and I want you to notice this and and the Bible says and straightway all the people when they beheld him they were greatly amazed and running to him saluted him and he asked the disciples or asked the scribes what question ye with them now apparently this multitude who Jesus would rebuke calling them a perverse a twisted bent generation were standing there and with unbelief and they were questioning the disciples Authority and even had qu caused the the disciples to begin to doubt now and when you doubt of course you know you're sighing in with the devil you're no longer agreeing with the word you are agreeing with the devil and so when the devil didn't immediately come out then I I can hear some in the crowd saying now now boys you're you're now facing a devil that's bigger than you you know you you don't have the power to cast him out and what was it now Satan had got into that crowd and unbelief overflowed and the disciples started doubting now you know God speaks of these this crowd and um and even of the Jews as a faithless and perverse generation I this these words actually come from the words of Moses that would be found in Deuteronomy 32 and8 and and first God speaks of them as a people I have chosen now this is what God had done with the disciples he had chosen 12 he had commissioned them he had empowered them he had sent them out and he had given them a word of authority and now they're attempting to use this word of authority and in a battle they are defeated now Jesus is dealing with a situation because he's got disciples now who are who have been defeated and they're wondering what was the cause how did we lose how did how did we lose this battle and of course Jesus will tell him it's because of your unbelief but where did that unbelief come from it came from the questioning of the crowd it came by men taking the word taking the Law taking the word and using it against them and so therefore doubts began to ensue and when doubts came oh you see then then they were powerless against the devil now so if you look at Deuteronomy 32 and 8 you're going to see again God choosing a people like he chose the disciples and like he chose you because you're a chosen people the Bible said you're a chosen generation a royal priesthood that means a kingly priesthood and and so in Deuteronomy 32 and8 he said when the most high divided the Nations their inheritance when he separated the sons of Adam he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel for the Lord's portion is his people Jacob is the lot of his inheritance so he said I chose Jacob I chose Israel amen I chose the seat of Abraham and they are the lot of my inheritance everything that I have is theirs now I want you to see where God has placed you because every promise of the book is yours amen you are the lot of God's inheritance and he found him in a desert land in the waste Howen Wilderness he led him about he instructed him and he kept him as the apple of his eye I want you to know God says of you you are my pride and joy you're the apple of my eye and as an eagle stirs up her nest and fluts over her young and spread abroad her wings and taketh them and bear them on her wings so the Lord alone did lead him and there was no strange god with them so God just this did alone it wasn't by any other power it was by God's power so he provided them with everything he supplied all their need and verse 13 says he made him ride on the high places of the earth he that he might eat the increase of the fields and he made him to suck honey out of the Rock and oil out of the flinty Rock and butter of kind and milk of sheep and the fat of lamb and the RMS of the breed of Bashan and goats with the fat of the kidneys of the wheat and and thou didst drink the the pure blood of the great but Jiran now this name for for Israel meaning the blessed one but the blessed one the blessed one wax fat and kicked Thou Art wax and fat Thou Art grown thick Thou Art covered with fatness and then he forsook God which made him and which had made him and lightly esteemed the rock of his salvation they provoked him to jealousy with strange Gods with Abominations provoked they him to Ang they sacrific to devils and not to God to Gods whom they knew not to New Gods that newly come up whom your fathers feared not of a of the rock that begat thee thou AR mind or or art unmindful and has forgotten God that formed thee and when the Lord saw it he abhor them because of the provoking of his sons and of his daughters and he said I will hide my face from them I will see what what there in shall be for there are very forward generation children in whom is no faith so I want you to notice here God said I have provided everything I you're the apple of my eye you are the lot of my inheritance I've given you blessing after the blessings you've sucked honey out of the rock you know I've given you abundance I've given you blessings but you're a forward generation of children who have no faith so this is the kind of people that Jesus was dealing with with this crowd of people who supposedly knew the word who supposedly had all the quotes all together and here they here in this moment they were throwing the quotes here at and using the word against the disciples and causing unbelief to where they had no Dominion now you know I tell you what if anyone should have believed it should have been that crowd of Jews I mean come on for what other people had the Red Sea opened for whatever what other people had had had the the power of God been shown and they and they were fed bread out of Heaven amen give power over serpents they were they were lad and got water from a rock I mean who else why who else should have believed you see but they would there but they had made their religion powerless with their Traditions you see they had word they had the law of God they had its promises and no power and no faith to make that word work their God was one who had plagued the Devils of Egypt who had read the Red Sea they drank water from the rock they were healed of serpent bites man that came down from heaven and yet they still didn't believe and neither did they have dominion they didn't have the power over this devil and neither now when their when their unbelief comes and hinders the disciples Faith neither do the disciples and this doubt this doubt stemmed from from a belief of a god of the past who wasn't able today and it caused Jesus to become exasperated as it as Jehovah was in in Moses day for they lightly esteemed the rock of Salvation they didn't regard that he was able you see here generation after generation had been turned to Faith by seeing the miraculous you know this was a people who had an Elijah with power oh who could call fire down from heaven and and Destroy 50 men at a time this was a man with power that fire came down from heaven consumed the sacrifice this was a man with great power with great Authority with God they had seen all of this they had been witness this was written in their Bible it was in their quotes you see but but you see you know here generation after generation had been turned to Faith by seeing the miraculous only Devol back into unbelief they they had a a long history of exasperating God Jesus seeing this unbelief exhibited instead of Faith he once again once again God got exasperated the doubt expressed by the crowd had taken root as as unbelief and the disciples and now they were wavering now they were doubting you know they were they were listening to the ridicule of the crowd of you know you you've cast out Little Devils but you can't cast out this one your power it just isn't great enough it it isn't enough see you don't have what it takes maybe one day when the Messiah comes when there comes a great made Messiah when a move of God comes it'll be but not now and there the Messiah was standing among them and they were exhibiting the power of that that Messiah but they were hindering it now with their unbelief yes you see in in their minds the word of the crowd became bigger than the words of Jesus now I want you to remember you must never let anything whether it's the doctor whether it's science whether whe whether it's people around you whether it's your own thoughts become bigger than the words of Jesus Amen his word must have preeminence in your life you see that to them the problem was too great The Devil was too big they were too powerless and the devil became greater in their minds than the words of Jesus and the power that he had given them cuz I just read you in the Bible where he gave them the power and sent them out to do this work and now they are out doing this work and and here they meet with failure you know I can almost hear some of the things saying You cast out devil through devil Powers through beyb you're you're one of those many who say Lord Lord have we not cast out devils in your name have we not done many marvelous Works listen let me tell you the bride must be able to say the same thing amen she must too must be able to say we are Mark 16 in action we have signs because they follow the word everything that of course it has that has signs are not the word but every time the true word is preach then signs follow amen so you know we we can hear the Roar of the C Crow and the scorn and the laughter and the scoffing as the crowd ridicules if you're anointed you must be false you see because only the aults are anointed because the Devil deceives by Miracles so we better not have Miracles because that's the way the devil deceives if you got miracles you must not be on the word your emphasis should should be on the word anyway and not Miracles so you hear the Roar of the crowd you know of of all of this and certainly I would say our emphasis for certain should not be on Miracles without word but neither should it be on word without Miracles the right emphasis is the word with Miracles if God be with you where are the Miracles Mark 16 and2 the Bible said and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them confirming the word with signs following that's what happened when the message and the commission was given by Jesus Christ they went forth and preached amen they demonstrated the word and the Lord was working with them and confirmed the word with signs following so Jesus now comes to his disciples find them in this dilemma that can't defeat the enemy and Jesus uses the same power that they are doubting that he has given to his disciples and he has that same power come on Amen and and he proved that the power he had given his disciples was enough amen that the devil could not resist the power when it was accompanied with faith there was nothing wrong with the word of power that Jesus gave they had lost their faith in the word and beginning to allow the devil a place in their minds I want you to get this you're don't allow the devil a place in your mind so while it's the Battleground brother Tim he's got a right to come there well you got a right to kick him out amen the Bible said cast down reasoning and every High thing that exalts itself against against the word of God you got a battle you got the right he's going to be an Invader just because you possess a land like Israel don't mean you don't get invaded on October the 7th it showed that they were vulnerable and open to attacks and the enemy attacked amen and they had to fight to possess and to hold their land and so are you God gave you a land but you're going to fight to possess it amen God Gave You promises in the book but you but it's a battle it is something where you cast out the inhabitants of the land now the only way of course you don't today you know the the devil many people are allowing him a place in their minds so well I can't help it yeah maybe you can help it you can't help that he comes and flies over but you don't have to let him Nest amen now you you've got a weapon you got a double barrel shotgun and an Acts 2 and 38 amen you've got the word of power in Old and New Testament you can fire away use the word against him amen you you know you've got to look at the promise of God and realize it is mine and it is worth possessing you see the and of course you know today that's the issue there nothing wrong with the word is that many have lost confidence in his power the only way to change this is through birthing a new generation who can believe but that but that's the problem every remove of God began with a renewed Faith only for one generation later to sink back into un belief again and this word perverse that Jesus uses refers to the disciples straying from the instructions that he had given them on account of their lack of faith in the truth and it wasn't that they didn't have the truth it wasn't that they didn't have the power it was when they had to fight against the questions of doubt that was posed by the crowd that their faith wavered causing them to disbelieve and this frustrated Jesus he called him a faithless and perverse generation and said how long will I put up with you how long will I put up with your unbelief I I won't be with you always you're going to have to learn to fight and repel unbelief and not yield to it you see in some cases even Jesus could not do himself he could not do great Miracles because of their unbelief not his unbelief but their unbelief but you see you see that's why he would have to put the Whalers out of gyrus his house you know who was weeping over gyrus his daughter who was dead their unbelief would hinder even the power of the Resurrection so you know brother Brandon preached a sermon called perfect faith and and the and the crowd will say now listen we have a whole crowd of Christian them today and that's what I'm talking about this perverse generation who takes the Word and questions it who takes the word and renders it powerless who who throws all the philosophy and thoughts of man and and Creeds and dogmas of man to try to hinder and to block you from believing now brother brandham preached a sermon called perfect faith and the crowd will say no one can have it but but a prophet but let me just tell you God wouldn't have sent a message if it was UN unattainable he don't just send a message to tickle our ears he sends a message for you to obtain to it amen so in perfect faith brother Ram said now at first the disciple didn't have this perfect Faith they didn't have it because they' had Christ walking with them but then afterwards Christ was in them now I want to ask you where are we is Christ is Christ with us or is he in us that's right amen now so he said it so it's hard to have this perfect faith without the Holy Spirit it has to bring it it does you say the disciples didn't have perfect Faith No they had that elep epileptic child there that they were trying to cast this devil out of him and they couldn't do it and the father seen Jesus coming and said we have brought my son to your disciples and they could not cure him see and afterwards the disciples asked Jesus saying why could not we cure him he said because of your un of your the lack of faith of your unbelief and he said now remember they had the power I want you to get it they had the power Jesus had given the power to heal the sick that's the word he had given it his word and the word had commissioned them he had give them power to raise the dead to cast out Devils just a few days before that they had the power but not the faith to use that power now that's the brandham Tabernacle there's the church the bride today the holy spirit is here with the power but you don't have the faith to move it see what I mean it takes faith to move it now we're going to get to that in a little bit because God has the power and it's there but you got to have faith to move that power now Jesus had given the word and this word had plenty of power his word has power his word spoke the world into existence when he walked here on the shores of Galilee he he stilled the waters with his word amen he broke bread and multiplied it by his word he took water and turned it into wine by his word come on he raised the dead by his word he did all kinds of things with the word he showed us the power that lays in the word now he had given his word and the word has plenty of power but Power can be hindered Ed by doubt and unbelief only faith and confidence and Trust in his word can release its power now when brother Brandon's talking about this he tell he reaches down in his pocket and he pulls a shell out I don't have one this morning but he has a bullet and he says I got a shell that I hand loaded I know by ballistics now he would put so much you got one no when nobody you know by ballistics like the word but he says I have to fire the gun and the fire has to get to the powder the powder has got the power but it's got to have the fire to light it off and the same thing the powder is in the Shell but it needs Faith to charge it and throw it out and that's what it it takes the perfect Faith to ignite the power of the ho H Spirit which we have now since he's come upon us Faith to ignite to see great things the faith something that presents it to you so brother brandham tells us this over again he uses many any illustration there's power in the word when he uses the illustration of the two cards and one both of them are filled with power one don't have spark he says that about this bullet it can't do anything it's got power in it but unless there's something to strike it now so Jesus commissioned us these signs shall follow them that believe and Jesus as the second Adam what he spoke happened Jesus showed us what life in the Holy Ghost is to be you hung up on me I don't know where you went but come back here Jesus showed us what life in the Holy Ghost is to be he was God's example son that every other son is made like amen so he showed us what life in the Holy Ghost is to be then the book of Acts of the Holy Spirit shows us men who were reborn to be just like Jesus they were Jesus men they were God men filled with the Holy Ghost the same Holy Spirit Jesus had that came on him at the River Jordan was the same holy spirit that was poured out on the b in the book of Acts not a different Spirit not a lesser Spirit The Same Spirit now Jesus as the second adom that that he he would commission us and he would show us what it was shows us shows us even in the book of Acts what men who are reborn are to be like and in Romans 8:29 Paul will say for them he forew he also predestined are you predestinated what are you predestinated to be on am me to be conformed to what so that's your destiny if you for knew you he set a Destiny for your life and that was to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many so he you see he's the first of a new race he's the head of a new race he's the first born of many so every other son born like him's going to be like him amen so he would be the firstborn among many Brethren yes that means you now in Hebrews chapter 2 and verse 10 the Bible said it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bring in many sons into Glory so I want you to see you know he who made all things and by him are all things that in bringeth many sons into glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings for both he that Sanctified and they who are Sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them Brethren saying I will declare my name unto his unto my brethren in the midst of the church will I sing praise to the quoting Old Testament scripture and again I will put my trust in him and again behold I am the children which God hath given me so he goes and shows us we are the children of God by the new birth and if we are that we are brothers we're just like Jesus we're of the same genus we're of the same species we have the same life amen now when Jesus came the Earth that he tread upon as the second item was uh much different from the one that the first Adam lived upon there was no curse in Eden it was not a cursed Earth there was no thoughts of doubt in Eden there was no conflict over whether or not I in position with Dominion Adam never battled a thought about moving a mountain or never never questioned whether he had faith enough to pluck up this tree and move it over there he just did it there was no battle against unbelief there was no doubts to contend with so he was in a in a perfect vacuum as a it was where that there was no evil no no sin no unbelief and he could operate in this perfect vacuum without any question without any doubt without any fear without any unbelief but the moment he moved out of Eden now then he is now the now he is subject to the very things that he once controlled now he will have to do things very differently he will have to move trees by the sweat of his brow now other things what was not impossible before becomes impossible because again he is in a fallen condition and the world Falls with him and I want you to think on it the Earth becomes cursed and brother bandam tells us in the messages um in several messages right right around the sermon the future home he he tells us and reim reemphasize it and proven his word and a couple other sermons right there how that Jesus came and he dwelt upon the Earth and he was Spirit born he was supernaturally born he was born of a virgin but wrapped around the blood cell was cursed Earth he he is B body was formed out of dust and it was corruptible and there would be even corruptible thoughts that would come to him he would have to battle against his own Humanity amen now so here here again I want you to see something here but Jesus would take his cursed Earth Down To The River Jordan amen make it and Obey him are you with me bring it down to the river Jordan and there God would would come and so so saturate curs Earth with a baptism of the Holy Ghost until now that cursed Earth was obeying God instead of the devil and he did the same thing to you in your new birth he came down and your cursed Earth and your hands which used to serve the devil now glorifies God your mouth that used to speak lies and curse and use evil word now speaks truth and Holiness and righteousness Hallelujah Why by the power of the Holy Ghost within you making curse Earth obey God by the way if heed redeemed you on the inside one day he's going to get the outside too and he'll redeem this Earth and change every molecule of it flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God he'll change you in a moment when CL of an eye when Jesus came he operated upon an earth that had been cursed where Satan was King Jesus acknowledged him as the Prince of this world the prince of the earth and where Satan Reigns unbelief Reigns and takes Dominion through the fiery darts that that wound Faith now before men sinned the Earth was in an Eden condition as the king of the earth and Adam spoke he dressed the garden nature obeyed his commands God had given him Dominion I want you to say the word dominion God had given him dominion over the Earth and when man sinned the F the the Earth fell with him and Adam lost his dominion and Satan become the prince of the power over atmospheres and man sold himself to S to sin and became subservient to the devil to sin to disease and to sickness but you see that's not the end of the story amen Jesus came and wrapped himself in cursed Earth and and they're paid the penalty of sin that was poured out upon his flesh upon the cursed Earth so that out of his life would come resurrection power to give back to the Believers where you could be filled with the same spirit that was in Jesus now Jesus Paid It all but he didn't stop there he gave you dominion over sin on over unbelief and over the devil saying in my name you will cast out Devils you will speak Heaven's language so well that's it says speak one speak with new tongues that's Heaven's language you will speak the language of Heaven you will take up serpents and cast them out you know I give you authority over every deadly thing the purchasing power is there the money is in the bank Jesus Paid It all but the way to reach it is out or to obtain it is out of the reach of too many they don't know how to write it to check now I want you to understand this is dilemma brother bradam found out as he he would tell this over and again I find two classes of people but he believed that God has sent a message that was to bring those two people together check riters who knew what they had now so he tells us and I'll just read this one again four uh Jesus um Jesus speaking the father seeking such that will worship Him in spirit and Truth his word is the truth the spirit and the truth many have the spirit no truth other has the truth no spirit and he said it's like a man that's got money in the bank don't know how to write the check the other know one knows how to write a check and got no money in the bank if you could ever get those two together spirit and Truth now that's what the message is to bring us back to is true worship where the two comes together looking under Jesus brother Bram talks about this again and he says I found two classes of people one the fundamental positionally he knows where he is in Christ because of the word but he doesn't have any faith in what he's doing he hasn't received the Holy Spirit then I find the Pentecostals many of them has received the Holy Ghost but don't know who they are just like a man who's got money in the bank can't write a check and the other can write a check got no money in the bank if you could get get those two together if you get the Pentecostal to realize who he is and come back to the real full word of God with the baptism of the Holy Ghost it would set the world of fire again with a new Pentecostal Revival in other words right a book of Acts so now as a whole the message people have the full word restored but they like the Dynamics to make it work and they're listening to the crowd that tells you it's not your season yet it's not the hour for it we we we don't have it yet it's coming but we don't have it this was exactly the same thing the crowd was telling them one day the I come and we'll have that kind of power but he ain't here yet and there he was but they were doubting it they were rejecting it now as a whole as I said the message people have have the full word restor but lack the Dynamics to make it work we have resource in the bank Jesus made the deposit and he sent a message of restoration but too many don't know how to write a check some have the word without Spirit other have Spirit no word one is word word word no spirit and they study the scripture and so well we're sons of God and and they believe that but they don't have any faith with the other has a lot of faith and they don't know they're sons of God one's like a man that has money in the bank but can't write a check others one can write a check got no money in the bank if we could ever get those the thing together till men and women will realize you that's been truly baptized in the holy spirit that and you have the token to display you have a right to every Redemptive blessing that God promised everything that he promises yours hold your token over your unwavering Faith as you pray and over his word faith in his word Now by and large we have failed to get it together you see we have allowed Satan to either make this all mechanics and no Dynamics or and become a bunch of powerless people whose only weapon is argument that won't stand up against Satan and he can out argue anytime he can beat you on an argument let me tell you the devil he is wise and he can beat you in an argument with half of his brains tied behind his back you'll never get anywhere debating with the devil don't even try use the word against him amen you you are no match for the devil and neither I want to say this neither is your sword which is the word of God a match until you get it out of the Scabbard and use it in the hand of Faith against him and I want to ask you how long are we going to be on the defensive and when are we going to take the offensive let me give you a scripture Jesus said the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against us those who have received the revelation of who Jesus is the divine revelation from God he said the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against that now what does that mean does that mean we're on the defensive and we're within the wall protected and Satan is just battering against our gates that ain't what it said it said it says that it means if the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against us it gives us a different picture than that it means we have Satan surrounded and he's under siege and the Gates of Hell come on cannot stand against us and that we are here on the offensive to overthrow Satan's kingdom for we are kings taking dominion over Satan over his kingdom and over his power it does not mean we're on the defensive it means we're on the offensive we're taking back what he has walled off from us a promise he has held back and it's time for the children of God to take offensive against the devil Amen to take your sword and March against it and say it's thus sayith the [Applause] Lord now either it becomes either all Dynamics and no mechanics all mechanics and no Dynamics but let me just share a quote with you from the great warrior David first thing you was elected and called and then when God elected you then he called you you heed it his called and he poured the anointing oil on you the Holy Ghost and when the cruise of oil what's the oil represent in the Bible the Holy Spirit and when he poured the oil upon him he baptized him with the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit and a symbol I hope you get get that and that just come fresh he poured oil upon him and it just went all over him a whole horn full of it amen not sparingly and that's the way God pours out the holy ghost on a man not sparingly just baptizes him with it amen anointing him with the spirit notice right then when that anointing struck him he was positionally placed as king amen you are positionally in Christ Jesus as priest and Kings amen the moment you receive the Holy Spirit God places you in the kingdom and air what a beautiful picture there you are amen so I want you to understand when the anointing come on David he was already King position by God ain't no Goliath going to kill him ain't nothing standing between him and that Throne going to stop him he is Anointed for a reason for a purpose and that is to sit on that Throne to take Dominion now he'll fight Civil Wars till it happened but he'll get it because he has to have a battle for Dominion now in the message the ark brother Brandon says we miserable wretched from all the lowest of all insects lowest of All Creatures morally polluted spiritually dead can be lifted from that place by the Ark of the blood of the Lord Jesus to be sons and daughters and Kings and Priests unto God that's what the new birth does it takes you as he said miserable wretched the lowest of all insects lowest of All Creatures morally polluted spiritually dead and lifted out of there Amen to be sons and daughters and Kings and Priests unto our God that's what Redemption does it elevates you come on yes praise the Lord think think about it just think it in Union with Christ it elevates us you know the new birth is the same as as a marriage where you are united with Christ so in the and the and that's other type it's a marriage you so you're the new birth of the Holy Spirit coming God uniting with you is a marriage so what did it do it took a RAB who was a harlot and elevated her by marriage to be the mother of the Messiah it took Ruth a despised woman a moabitas and by marriage to Boaz elevated her to become the mother of kings and even the Messiah your marriage to Christ elevates you into position of royalty Hallelujah royalty that's why he said you're a royal priesthood you're a holy nation you're a chosen Offspring generation Offspring so you see brother bradam said in his prayer and where I think Pentecost failed he said make these ladies here Lord an example of Womanhood in their neighborhood where they live where they dwell make these men anointed light so granted father right in this Bunch stands young men oh God lay your hands upon them for the ministry give them a call and may they live such lives until you separate them from out from among the people and set them and adopt them into thy family father and anoint them as Kings and Priests to rule in your kingdom give them Ministries and things to bring to do to bring others to Christ but notice what he said anoint them to be Kings and Priests to rule Dominion in the message Messiah he brings it again God called us and we become Kings and Priests unto God Like Jesus was God's high priest we become a lesser priest Jesus was God in fullness dwelt in him to to Shine for the expression of God to the world for God was in Christ reconciling the world to him and as God was in Christ reconciling the world to him God comes in his church and anoints him some Messiahs do you see it the same thing he's did in his church the same power he had is in his church and his church becomes his dominion and he's King over this dominion and we are Kings and Priests offering spiritual sacrifice to God and the fruits of our lips given praise to his name there are Messiahs little Messiah little anointed ones anointed what off of what the main one anointed off the great one so let's get some Bible for this turn with me to Revelation chapter 1 verse4 and we'll read these words from the Holy Scripture and the Bible said and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince the chief ruler the commander the leader of the kings of the earth think of this so he here again he's the first begotten of the dead and the prince can you say he's your commander and chief he's your leader he's the chief ruler of what peons no Kings you see unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood so who are these kings that he's commanded o Commander over the next verse says and he have made us Kings and Priests and unto God and his father to be to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen so now according to the Bible he is Prince of kings and he made you one of them why else is he called King of Kings and Lord of lords Lord is a ruler people with Dominion people with a kingdom people Bor into the kingdom of God that's the Holy Ghost that's the realm we have been born into is the realm of the Holy Ghost in the kingdom of God the kingdom of the Holy Ghost and there you are a king Lord of lords king of kings and notice what he said and he hath made us that's something we want to emphasize right there because he hath made us salvation is his doing I didn't make myself a king I didn't say here am and this is my authority and I'm taking this position God placed me here God placed me as a ruler God Place me as a king with a domain come on a King Without a domain is no King at all he gave you a Dominion so we we we are Kings We Are Spiritual Kings oh yeah we're going to be Kings upon the Earth with him when he sits on the throne and in the Millennium but right now we are Kings and we Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom that's and this is what he said you Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom you speak Heaven's language you have Heaven's Authority and when you in this realm of spirits when you tell a devil to go he's beneath you he has to mind what you say so in my name you will cast out Devils you will heal the sick cuz that's casting out Devils you will speak Heaven's language and if you if you drink any deadly thing it won't hurt you he gave you a Dominion now why else like I said would he be called king of kings and Lord of lords because he is King he has Kings under him and as Supreme Lord he has Lords or rulers beneath him a and so a a king can't be a king if he has no Dominion he can't make you King and all right you're a king but you don't have a Dominion no you have a throne a king has a throne a king has a domain so right now we reign with Christ and I'm quoting this from Brother bradam the church Age We reign with Christ having dominion over sin the World the Flesh and the devil so don't tell me you don't have dominion over your flesh don't tell me you know porn and all that lust and everything else has to rule over you you rule it amen you see we have dominion over sin the World the Flesh and the devil amen so you see we are priests and Kings un God and no wonder he said the world does not appeal to us we are peculiar people zealous and the good works we have been recreated in him to be children like our father so let's just read some B more Bible Colossians chapter 1:3 the Bible says who hath delivered us from the power of Darkness how many believes you have been delivered from the power of darkness and have translated us into the kingdom or the reign of his dear son so you you were in darkness you were sometimes Darkness you were lost and out in sin but Redemption he delivered you from the power of darkness and now you are reigning with him in the Kingdom of his dear son notice in again it says in Romans 5:17 if by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which received abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness shall reign in life look at that word reign in life rule in life they will have dominion in Life by One Jesus Christ now let me read this from The Way Mount um New Testament translation for you through the transgression of one individual that was Adam death made made the use of the one individual to seize the sovereignty all the more shall those who receive God's overflowing Grace and gift of righteousness reign as kings in life through one individual Jesus Christ amen so we are here to Reign Amen to reign as kings in life through that one individual death by Adam caused us to fall and we lost our sovereignty amen but with our new birth we are now back into sovereignty again amen we reign as kings in life through that one man Jesus Christ so Paul is saying through that transgression of Adam one individual brought death now Satan Reigns over man and therefore the Earth but through death sovereignty and Rule uh it was taken and power was taken from men but those who receive of God's overflowing abundant grace and favor and the gift of righteousness all the more through Jesus Christ we reign in life as kings and when you receive the Holy Ghost you receive the gift of righteousness Hallelujah that means the moment you accept Jesus Christ and are born of his Spirit God becomes your righteousness amen that is the gift of righteousness it means that everyone of us that have been born again become into a kingly and a queenly state and we're accepted by God to reign as kings and queens in the realm of life in the realm of death death you were a peon you are insect you were the lowest of the lowest but here you have been translated into the kingdom of his dear son and you have been elevated to kingship with a Dominion amen and you have his [Music] righteousness this is why brother brandom said if the blood of bulls and goats could put a man in position to speak into existence what about the blood of Jesus that's more powerful and that can take away every sin see under an inferior blood of bulls and goats Abraham spoke and a ram appeared how' they get there Abraham spoke it a ram tied in the thicket by its horns God provided a sacrifice it's why he's called Jehovah Gyra the Lord provides Moses spoke flies were created and frogs and lice and boils rang down upon Satan Kingdom Joshua spoke and the Sun and the Moon Stood Still but we're but we are now under the blood of God and not just under it but I want to say you're born of it Hallelujah it ain't just something between you in God you are now born of that blood Hallelujah you you are the blood by the spirit when the spirit of God enters into you the blood of God came into you you were born of his genus you were born of his blood you were born of his life and yet we question the Greater Works we doubt it being ours we unbelief unbelief the crowd says it's only for great men only prophets such as brother brandham can do the Greater Works only brother brandham could have perfect faith and we we look at ourselves as unworthy I'm not worthy for that as if the blood was inefficient we can't believe it takes away every St of sin and gives us God's righteousness but you you have been born again by receiving the Holy Ghost are Kings and Priests with dominion and you have the righteousness of Jesus Christ and you're standing before God Amen without a trace of sin let me read it to you from the Bible 2 Corinthians 5:21 he hath made him to be sin for us do you believe that amen do you believe that on the cross Jesus Jesus became your sin amen he took your sins he paid for your sins he went to hell for with your sins he took them all the way down to Hell and throw them on the devil Hallelujah say no don't belong on my sons and daughters Hallelujah I'm taking their sins what's now I'm paying the price that we might become the righteousness of God in him he became your sin that you might become his righteousness Hallelujah you are the very righteousness of God himself no wonder you have access Before the Throne you're a king priest with Dominion in Union with Christ you been made the righteousness of God uh I I know I know when when preaching this there comes up a wave of unbelief from all the crowd screaming at you and for some it came from years where you you've sat under false teaching religion has taught you that to be humble you have to say you're a sinner that you're no good that you don't amount to anything we're all Sinners we just can't make it we Have No Dominion over it you God just forgives us but we have to live in this decrepit condition and we sing songs like I'm just a sinner saved by grace we're not Sinners we were Sinners but not now not now come on no Holy Ghost no Holy Ghost filled believer willfully sins we are Sons filled with God's righteousness if you're born again you are God's son or daughter Hallelujah you're as righteous as he is righteous amen you the requirement that Jesus said be as perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect is accomplished by God passing on to you his rightous nness therefore you stand before God as perfect as he [Applause] is amen we might just have a runaway for it's over with don't go before God denying your sunship and placing yourself in the realm of death and telling God you're just so dirty and unclean that's an insult to God telling him that the sacrifice of his blood was not enough to cleanse you and put you in right standing before him that his life has not delivered you that's a slap in his face amen you know here is our position through Christ you know God God has or we have become God's righteousness and his blood was sufficient therefore therefore comes to pass the scripture in Isaiah 54:17 no weapon no devil no demon power no epileptic whatever the name of it no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue every tongue every lying tongue everything the devil says against you that rises against you in judgment you will condemn it Hallelujah this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and their righteousnesses of me sayeth the [Applause] Lord you claim weakness you sing unbelief you talk weakness you pray weakness and you go out and live it I'll never get well I'll never overcome this this is a family trade had handed down from generations and nobody has ever been able to break it well listen I'm not expecting you to break it like that amen and that birth you're subject to it you're going to fall to it you're going to be aired to it you it's in your jeans and you're going to get it but I'll tell you there is only not just that birth there is a new birth and when we are born again it cancels out all the C all the generational curses no matter what your daddy did and how evil he was or your granddaddy or that one and this generational curse stops it stops with the [Applause] blood well my parents wasen righteous my my grandparents and they were evil and they did this and they had all kinds of illegitimate things and things going on bad things it stops the blood stops IT the blood cleanses it the blood washes the blood does away with it it bursts you new and you're no longer that creature you're a new creation a brand new species somebody that the devil don't know what to do with you Hallelujah when Jesus come he saw a brand new species that had never been seen before amen he tripped Moses up he he would he would trip Elijah up he would come up on there and bring bring bring all kinds of of things on him he'd run for his life and and he come with all kinds of horrible depression that would come upon him and all of that but Jesus was a different species amen Moses failed Elijah would fail all the prophets would fail the law would fail all of them come on but Jesus no matter how he tempted him he wouldn't fall that's right and through death he took Dominion he gathered death into his body and took it and took the Dominion went down to the king's kingdoms of hell and says I've taken the keys and guess what he rose up on the third day and he gave you the keys some will glory in weakness to justify themselves well brother Tim you know I believe when I would do good evil is always present with me so I just can't help doing what I do I just can't help from sinning well Paul did say that about himself being a sinner under the law but he didn't leave you there he defined exactly how you were under the law how you were under sin and death and how you couldn't live it but he didn't stop there amen for he says in Romans 7:24 he sums it up and he said oh Wretched Man that I am because that's what a man is he's wretched in his first birth he can't live right he can't do right he can't make it oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from this body of this death I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord who will do it I think God Jesus does it it yes therefore there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus that's the next verse by the way uh Romans 8:1 who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus have made me free from the law the Dominion of sin and death for what the law could not do and that it was weak to the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and part sin condemn sin in the flesh that the righteousness required by the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit Hallelujah the righteousness he required under the law that they couldn't keep Hallelujah you can keep it why because the righteousness of Jesus Christ has been imputed to you let me just say the blood of Jesus is not weak our God is not a puny punching bag he's all powerful within us Psalm 78 and verse 40 how often did they provoke him in the wilderness and grieve him in the desert yay they they turned back and tempted God and limited the Holy One of Israel they remembered not his hand nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy how he wrought his signs in Egypt and his wonders in the field of Zorn look here what they did they limited the Holy One of Israel by and remembered not what he had done they forgot his power and so they Li lied him and this is what this crowd was doing they were they were limiting you can't do this you don't have the power to do this it ain't the hour for it it's not the time we you know you know we're we're all kinds of excuses days of Miracles are passed this is not the age of the Apostles the crowd screaming out and they limit the Holy One of Israel the limit God and when you limit God you limit yourself amen you limit his grace you limit his word until our God becomes a little bitty God we magnify failure and deify it until for some the devil is bigger than God right now there's people in this church right now the devil is bigger than God you make him bigger in your minds than God on you worship that Spirit you won't turn it loose you won't admit you want you w allow Faith to take root in your life to say you know to say my God is able my God's A Healer my God's a deliverer I am not going to be a failure I'm rising Above This I have been predestined to be conformed to his IM I have been made like him I'm going to believe like him I don't care what the crowd is saying I don't care what the psychologist and the psychiatrist and the doctors are saying I believe what God's word said my God Is Bigger he's bigger than cancer my God Is Bigger than any disease name a sickness name any problem it has to bow to the name of Jesus for at the name of Jesus every knee has to Bow and every tongue confess that he's ruler sickness comes along we just say well we're human and we accept it as something normal sickness is something everybody gets and we and we forget that sickness is not natural in fact it's unnatural in fact it's supernatural what yeah sickness is Supernatural it's a demon amen it's beyond the realm of natural it's a demon and we were given dominion over it we don't ra rule so much in the realm of the flesh we rule rule in the realm of the spirit look look at brother brandom and I brought this out before you know when when to hear the he was um uh a Man shows up in I think it was Houston Texas or no it was up in Portland Oregon in Portland Oregon a Man shows up the meeting he has been one who has threatened preachers he has not only threatened them he is he's taken them and literally tore them apart pulled them out of the pull pit and beat him and he comes to the meeting and he's string striding down the the aisle with a determined look headed toward brother brandham and he he's got a scowl on his face and he's angry and he's threatening and he says you deceiver you deceiver you know you're claiming all of this this power and this healing and I'm going to show you you ain't got any power I'll throw you out in the middle of this audience I'll break every bone in your body brother Brandon said I think he called himself a pugilist anyway he had trained you know how to fight he knew a little bit about how to lay a punch he was standing there and he says then the then the man stood in his face and he was breathing out these threats and calling him names and everything else and and then he just haed down spit in his face what was he trying to do get him in the flesh realm the devil can beat you in the flesh amen come on Amen your flesh is weak it'll never defeat the devil that is not where your spirit realm is your realm is over spirits and brother Bram said Satan had made a challenge he said now God made a challenge and he spoke out of him and said because that you have defied the servant of the of God you will fall at my feet and said the man said I I'll show you now you can you can get on YouTube you can watch Daisy osbor tell about how it was you can hear you can hear people who was Witnesses we don't just have to take brother brandom's words but his word's good enough for me but he said they they testified that as he reached back to slug brother brandom it was like he hit an invisible wall and crumbled down on top of brother Brandon's feet and lay there and the policeman come up and said uh is he delivered he said no he worships that Spirit he said but I I would appreciate if you would roll him off my feet and he steps back up to the pulpit he' been preaching on faith and he steps back and he said now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen faith is an unseen reality and and you just seen in other words Faith work in an unseen realm amen bring nature even subject a m a mad man subject amen you've seen that and he said as he began to speak and just say th those words he said uh you know all throughout the building he said men and women rose up out of cck throwed away their crutches come out of wheelchairs and he said in just a few minutes every person in the building was healed let me quote his word he said when the chief of that tribe of demons fell everything beneath him fell with it hallelujah hallelujah I'm talking to a people who are Kingdom ARS I'm talking to people who are Sons and Daughters of the king I'm talking to people that will resist the devil in this generation Hallelujah until the chief of the tribes of demons of this world fall to the name of Jesus Christ and we are changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and the dead in Christ of 2,000 years will rise Hallelujah we have been given Dominion we have given been given a commission but we will Embrace sin as something normal you don't think of dominion is like the devil's bigger than God and that was still under his Reign and yet his word says by his gift you are righteous his word said you are healed by his stripes you dare to declare your possession as a king and say I'm done with sin I will re over with I am done with sickness you dare to stand as a Believer and say I have the commission as a Believer amen from Jesus Christ the King of Kings cast Satan out to take up this serpent it'll not harm me but instead I will cast it out we reign as kings in the realm of life God is not simply a life insurance company that pays premium at death that all our rewards we get when we die we Reign now as kings in this realm of life too often we don't realize that through our new birth we are in Union with God we don't realize the new birth is a real Incarnation that as his bride we his body through which he does his work through which he takes Dominion you see they they don't know that they are sons and the daughters of God as Jesus is the great body of the Christian church today literally has no Dominion the crowd that I'm talking about they have the the most befog concept of what God has done and what God is to them and what they are to God I just ask you this this morning which of us don't need tree killing faith I don't need to kill a sic ofine tree and pluck it up and put in the sea but what about those cancers with roots grow through your body what about those roots of arthritis Wrecking havocs in your joints what about the disease in your liver the words of Jesus dried trees up from their roots well you see brother Tim here's a problem we don't have today we just don't have enough Faith well what was Malachi 40 do turn our hearts back to believing well we don't have enough Faith so the disciples in Luke 175 they the apostles said to the Lord increase our faith and the Lord said you don't need very much if you had Faith as a grain of mustard seed the tiniest seed if you had just the tiniest seed of Faith you could say to this sick of mine tree be PL up by the root and be planted in the sea and it should obey you it don't take much that's right Jesus said faith is a grain of mustard seed would move Mighty tree pluck them up cast them in the sea you have faith I want to say you have faith it was born in you come on you were born of faith you wasn't born of unbelief that's how you got here through the first time you were born of unbelief through Eve sin but now through the new birth you're born of Faith somebody help me preach you have faith it was born in you that's what the message came to do turn your your faith back to turn you your heart back to believing again so quit making excuses for not having faith now brother bradam said time tested Faith he challenged the church there he said if the church would put more faith to work you'd see more things taking place in the church the pastor might stand on Sunday morning Sunday evening whatever preaches hard on faith and a mighty message but if the members don't take that message and start putting it to work it'll fall right back the birds of the air will pick it up just take it out put it to work God wants you to do it and Faith always an experience accompanies fath faith and he says then he gives the illustration he said you ladies you got you got a canary bird or parakeet or whatever it is little pets and you what goodes it do giving them vitamins you know Make Them Bones strong strong bones and fine Wings if you keep him in a cage he said there's no need of giving him that if he's going to stay in the cage and he said what does good does it do to preach a Bible of a God that heals the god that has power and tell the people days of Miracles are passed in other words keep them caged this is what the crowd was doing caging the disciples keeping their faith from working unbelief now becoming greater than what the promise of God was and he said it's like a man freezing to death you show him a painted fire and he said you nice big picture of with with a fire that someone painted man can't get warmed by it he's freezing he's got to have warmth and a man that's thirsting for God can't satisfy be satisfied till something happens there an experience and that kind of experience will G bring forth great faith you'll never know what it is you cannot trust God who you never met amen so let me just say it to you the real message doesn't bind the spirit amen it Rel releases the holy spirit this Dominion was given to us by the new birth it comes with being Godlike or children of God he's given you a realm to rule over as a preacher as a la member as a dad as a mother as a youth a young person God has given you given you a realm in his kingdom of the Holy Ghost where you are to rule you are to make Master let me just say it you don't have to believe F you're not waiting on it you have it it was provided Faith was provided to you by the new birth you don't have to believe for it you have it it's an unseen spiritual reality amen you've been given them you have been given a Measure of Faith it was provided by the new birth you have it you don't have to claim it by faith that you have it you don't have you don't have a right you don't have a right to have it you have it it's a spiritual unseen reality you don't have to believe for any of it you simply need to act on it the moment you believed I'm telling you when you truly believed God filled you with the Holy Ghost and you become a possessor of eternal life and everything connected right right amen what does that include it includes righteousness literal sunship peace Joy Authority love Health Redemption freedom from bondage and the and Dominion of sin it includes a freedom from sickness lack from Satan from Death that's what it includes amen now we've got to take our place and we got to act theart we got to enjoy our right and our privileges as Sons and Daughters United in the life of Jesus Christ so we know why can you move mountains why can you kill fig trees because you have great faith no because you are a literal son or daughter of God who have authority why he can do it cuz he got better Faith than me no he can do it cuz he's a son you can do it too amen we have been authorized by the Lord Jesus to exercise his authority upon the earth when Jesus went away he said all power in Heaven and Earth is given to me in heaven and earth and he said now you go with this Authority that I'm given you and you teach All Nations baptizing them name of the father Son and Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I've commanded you and lo I am with you always I'm here to back you up all Heaven's Authority is behind you even how long to the end of the world take that devil even right now in Le oia through the union with Christ at the new birth we have the same Authority that he had when he lived on the earth now the Bible said in John 20 and verse 21 Jesus said unto them to them again peace be unto you as the father has sent me so send I you and when he had said this he pred on them and said unto them receive you the Holy Ghost now watch look at this he says as the father sent me so send I you amen and then he said so receive ye the Holy Ghost so what was he say it when you receive the Holy Ghost then just as the father send him he sends you how did the father send him by coming in him come on God was incarnate in Christ somebody help me preach amen and when God fills you with the Holy Ghost it is God living in you God dwelling in you God possessing you amen and you're born of the Breath of God just like Adam was at the beginning Hallelujah but this time into eternal life not just mortal Life as a father sent me so send I you Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 5 I'm going to I'm going to quit sometime today I will but in Ephesians 2 and verse 5 even when we were dead in sins he had quickened us that means made us alive together God when you were dead in sin he made you alive with Christ by Grace you are saved and he didn't just leave you there just bring you to life he raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that means he positioned us with Dominion with Kingdom power with him amen now watch now what he said Ephesians 1:22 and he had put all things under his feet can we say amen and he gave him to be had over all things to the church amen which is his body the church which is body the fullness of him that filth all and all Hallelujah the church is his fullness and is his his body and he put it under his feet and if he put it under his feet he put it under the church's feet he gave you Dominion hallelujah amen sin is under your feet sickness is under your feet demons are under your feet amen they're all beneath you you are rulers you are Kings you are his [Applause] righteousness Hallelujah and the Bible said let you know one once again it isn't the question of your great faith but of his great power that's why brother randam said when you get this prayer cloth don't think about how your faith is and how little it is and how weak it is and what your faith is like think about how big your God is amen how able he is you get focused on the wrong thing you're looking at your faith and said is it enough it's just some Mustard Seed that's all it takes to move a mountain that's all it takes to move a tree that's great faith Mustard Seed Faith now so first John says verse four chapter 4 verse 17 herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment and watch and I'm going to key on this because as he is so are we in this world that is a power pack scripture right there Hallelujah here in is our love made perfect that he may have we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world as he is so are we as he is so are we as he is so am I [Applause] did Jesus tell you put faith in your ability put faith in your human power put Faith in what you can do Mark 11:22 Jesus said to them have faith in well why is it hard to have faith in God come on that should be easy he opened Red Seas he brought curses down on the Demons of Egypt come on somebody amen he brought water out of the rock he showed us with multitude after multitude Open the Eyes of the blind raising the Dead come on casting out Devils doing
