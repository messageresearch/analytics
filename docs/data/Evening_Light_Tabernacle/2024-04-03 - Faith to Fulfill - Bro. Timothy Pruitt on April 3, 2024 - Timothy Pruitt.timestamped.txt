[36:11] need to be baptized of thee and comest
[36:14] thou to me and Jesus answered unto him
[36:17] saying suffer it to be now so now for
[36:20] thus it becometh us to fulfill all
[36:24] righteousness and then he suffered him
[36:27] and Jesus when he was baptized went
[36:29] straight way out of the water and lo the
[36:31] heavens were open unto him and he saw
[36:33] the spirit of God descending like a dove
[36:35] and lighten upon him and L a voice from
[36:38] Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in
[36:41] whom I am well pleased amen God bless

[37:23] successful camp and so you know all the
[37:26] sound and video team the musicians the
[37:29] gator Patrol Those that could could be
[37:32] counselors and you know even like I said
[37:34] those that were unseen and maybe nobody
[37:37] saw what you did but thank you anyhow
[37:39] and we sure appreciate it it was a great
[37:41] camp and I believe it had a great
[37:43] outcome I believe we ended up baptizing
[37:46] four souls but U then one went home to
[37:48] be baptized but there was many that were
[37:51] touched amen including myself and I'm
[37:53] thankful for that and but it could not
[37:55] have happened you know without everyone
[37:58] involved and you know I'd like to say

[38:02] appreciate you for that uh we heard some
[38:04] wonderful Services preached you know by

[39:33] there to fulfill the scriptures that are
[39:35] written about this day now you know I
[39:37] know we we look at all the other
[39:40] examples in the Bible and those that

[39:45] scriptures but we also have scriptures
[39:47] to fulfill amen the critics have
[39:50] scriptures to fulfill amen those who uh
[39:54] uh uh like Judas would go and and and
[39:57] and do what what he did There's also
[39:59] those that have to fulfill those
[40:01] scriptures and and and you know as we
[40:03] read this as Jesus is coming to be
[40:05] baptized John was like wait a minute you
[40:08] know I shouldn't be baptizing you but
[40:10] you should be baptizing me and Jesus
[40:12] said no suffer it to be so for it
[40:15] becometh us or it is in other words it
[40:18] is fitting or it is proper or it is the
[40:21] right thing to do to fulfill uh to bring
[40:24] to completion or reality something
[40:26] that's desired or promised and a and to
[40:30] fulfill all righteousness and brother
[40:31] Brandon would talk about this many times
[40:34] about the righteousness he is speaking
[40:36] of was the word of God Amen to fulfill
[40:39] the word of God that was spoken of him
[40:41] amen as a as a priest that would have to
[40:44] be washed before he could go into
[40:46] service and and he had to fulfill that
[40:49] part and you know and you can look like
[40:51] I said through the scriptures about even
[40:53] Abraham you know when in Hebrews chapter
[40:55] 6 and verse 13 it said when God made a
[40:58] promise to Abraham because he was could
[41:00] swear by no greater he swear by himself
[41:03] saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee
[41:06] and multiply it I will multiply thee but
[41:09] after he had patiently endured he
[41:11] obtained the promise so it wasn't just
[41:14] something that was easy or something
[41:15] that was uh you know just a walk in the
[41:19] park but he had to endure things before
[41:21] he was able to obtain the promise and we
[41:24] we know his life story we've went
[41:26] through it many times been preached
[41:27] about many times that it wasn't just the
[41:29] first day or the first year or the first
[41:31] 10 years that it took place but it took
[41:34] place in his life because he had Faith
[41:36] to fulfill what was spoken of him amen
[41:39] and he held on to it and he he he walked
[41:42] with it he he kept on as at at what God
[41:45] had promised him and I I believe that
[41:47] God also has a people in this day that
[41:49] has that same same kind of Faith amen
[41:52] you wonder why people can continue on
[41:54] like they're walk like like they're
[41:56] going because God has deposited that
[41:59] faith on the inside of us by the Holy
[42:02] Spirit and and that's what gives us the
[42:04] faith Amen to stand in the day that
[42:06] we're living in to stand in the day of
[42:09] critics to stand in the day of naysayers
[42:11] or name callers to stand in the middle
[42:13] of all of it is because God has put a
[42:16] deposit of faith on the inside of us to
[42:19] believe what has been spoken of us now
[42:21] there's many in this time that we're
[42:23] living in that's walking away from the
[42:25] faith as the scripture talks about the
[42:27] falling away that would take place and
[42:29] they're fulfilling the scripture that is
[42:30] spoken of them but amen I believe that I
[42:33] I'm I'm not talking to a people that's
[42:35] that's fulfilling that scripture but
[42:37] they're fulfilling the scripture of the
[42:39] Rapture they're fulfilling the scripture
[42:41] of the body chains they're fulfilling
[42:43] the scripture amen that spoken in the
[42:45] about the leoan church age of uh there
[42:48] are those that are filling the naked and
[42:51] blind and don't know it but there's also
[42:53] those that are accepting the eyes s of
[42:55] the word and and the eyes myself of God
[42:58] to be able to see things Amen to be able
[43:00] to O be an overcomer in this day and and
[43:03] I I believe that's who I'm speaking to
[43:04] tonight amen you know I I was looking at
[43:07] this and I ran across this again and
[43:09] it's a wonderful uh uh uh um thing in
[43:12] the in the church age book of of pick up
[43:14] my pen and write and brother brand talks
[43:16] about this and he he writes this all out
[43:18] and he says here he was one night
[43:20] seeking the Lord and the Holy Spirit
[43:22] told me to pick up my pen and write and
[43:24] I grabbed a pen and wrote begin to write
[43:26] and the spirit gave me a a message for
[43:27] the church and I want to bring it to you
[43:30] so amen it's for us amen that God would
[43:33] would anoint the prophet to write these
[43:34] things down he says here's what I'm
[43:36] trying to say to you the law of
[43:38] reproduction is in each species brings
[43:40] forth of its own kind even according to
[43:42] Genesis 1:1 God said let the Earth bring
[43:45] forth grass and the herb yielding seed
[43:48] and the fruit tree yielding fruit after
[43:49] his kind who seeds in itself upon the
[43:52] Earth and it was so whatever life was in
[43:55] the seed came forth in the plant then
[43:57] into the fruit and the very same law
[43:59] applies to the church today whatever
[44:02] seed started the church it will come
[44:04] forth and be like the Original Seed
[44:06] because it is of that seed in these last
[44:09] days the true bride Church Christ seed
[44:12] will come to The Headstone and she will
[44:14] be a super Church a super race as she
[44:17] nears him they and the bride will be so
[44:20] much like him that they will be in his
[44:22] very image amen this is an order to be
[44:25] United with him they will be one they
[44:27] will be the very manifestation of the
[44:29] word of the Living God denominations
[44:32] can't produce this wrong seed they will
[44:34] produce their Creeds and their dogmas
[44:36] and mixed with the word this mongolz and
[44:38] brings forth a hybrid product but he
[44:41] said the first son Adam was a was a
[44:43] spoken word seed of God and and he was
[44:46] given a bride to reproduce himself and
[44:48] that's why the bride was given him to re
[44:51] reproduce and and to produce another son
[44:53] and he goes through and he speaks about
[44:55] how the serpent got to her before he did
[44:57] but he he then he comes all the way over
[44:59] to Mary and he say then the word came to
[45:02] the promise of of Mary the Virgin and
[45:05] and that word that was promised was he
[45:07] himself was to be made manifest God was
[45:10] to be made manifest acted at that time
[45:13] and fulfilled his own Word of Promise in
[45:16] the Virgin it is the angel that brought
[45:18] it but it's the Angel's message was the
[45:20] word of God it was what was spoken of
[45:23] him amen Isaiah 9:6 and he fulfilled at
[45:27] that time all that was written of him
[45:29] because she accepted the word for her to
[45:32] be fulfilled in her and he said the
[45:34] members of the Virgin bride will love
[45:37] him they will have his potentials for he
[45:40] is their head and all power belongs to
[45:43] him they are subjects to him as members
[45:46] of our bodies are subject to our heads
[45:48] notice the harmony of the father and the
[45:50] son Jesus never did anything until it
[45:53] first showed him by the father excuse me
[45:57] John 5:9 this harmony is now to exist
[46:01] between groom and his bride and he shows
[46:04] her his Word of Life she receives it she
[46:07] never doubts it therefore nothing can
[46:09] harm her not even
[46:12] death amen for if it it if the seed to
[46:15] be planted and the water will raise it
[46:17] up again here is the secret of this you
[46:20] ready for the secret the word is in the
[46:22] bride as it was in Mary the bride has
[46:25] the mind of Christ where she knows what
[46:28] he wants done with the
[46:30] word hallelujah she performs the command
[46:34] of the word in his and his name for she
[46:36] has thus sayeth the Lord then the word
[46:38] is quickened by the spirit and it comes
[46:41] to pass like a seed that is planted in
[46:43] water it comes to full Harvest serving
[46:46] his purpose those in the bride do only
[46:48] his will none no one can make them do
[46:52] otherwise they have thus sayith the Lord
[46:54] or they keep Still They Know that it was
[46:57] has to be God in them doing the works
[47:00] fulfilling the word he did not complete
[47:02] all the work while he was here in his
[47:05] Earthly Ministry so now he's working in
[47:08] and through a
[47:10] bride Hallelujah she knows that for it
[47:14] is she knows that for it is not yet time
[47:16] for him to do certain things that he
[47:19] must now do amen but he will now fulfill
[47:23] through the bride that work which he
[47:25] left for this specific spefic time amen
[47:28] so he couldn't fulfill all the scripture
[47:31] in Groom form amen he had some of the
[47:34] scripture that had to be fulfilled in
[47:36] Bride form amen that the bride had to
[47:39] fulfill it amen it wasn't a tape that
[47:41] was going to fulfill it it wasn't one
[47:43] man that was going to fulfill it it was
[47:45] the bride that was going to fulfill it
[47:48] amen and nothing can make her do
[47:50] anything else I I like that statement
[47:52] because what that tells me the devil
[47:54] can't make me do anything amen because
[47:56] because the word has been deposited
[47:58] inside of me by the holy spirit amen and
[48:01] is moving inside my life and it's giv me
[48:04] Faith to stand no matter what I'm going
[48:06] through no matter what trials I'm in no
[48:09] matter what sickness I'm in no matter
[48:11] what trouble I'm in I have faith to
[48:13] believe the word of God hallelujah amen
[48:16] and my faith is not dependent upon
[48:19] whether things are good or not or
[48:21] whether there's money in the bank or not
[48:22] or whether I'm well or not or whether I
[48:25] feel good or not it has nothing to do
[48:27] with that my faith is depending upon
[48:29] what his word said and my faith is
[48:31] standing upon the word that word that
[48:34] will never pass away amen your feelings
[48:37] will pass
[48:38] away you'll have good feelings one day
[48:41] and they'll pass away and there'll be
[48:43] bad feelings the next day then they'll
[48:45] pass away and you'll have good feelings
[48:46] another day amen but the word of God
[48:49] will not pass away it will stand there
[48:52] no matter if you feel it if you see it
[48:55] if anything's everything's around you
[48:57] cloudy and dismal and dull it has
[48:59] nothing to do with it his word is still
[49:02] there his word is still declaring amen I
[49:05] am the same yesterday today and forever
[49:08] Hallelujah it doesn't matter what we're
[49:10] going through I that's why I love that
[49:12] song sister amen sister lar saying amen
[49:16] I've never walked alone he's always been
[49:18] what gives me Faith to continue to walk
[49:21] why how why can I have this Faith cuz I
[49:24] am not walking alone amen I am not by
[49:28] myself you are not by yourself you've
[49:30] been through a lot of Trials you've been
[49:32] through a lot of problems but never one
[49:34] time have you been through one sickness
[49:37] without him never one time have you been
[49:39] through one trial without him never one
[49:42] time have you been in one battle without
[49:44] him he is there why can I say that cuz
[49:47] his word says he
[49:50] is that's why we're not concerned about
[49:53] whether we got a full church or a half
[49:55] empty church it matters long as we got
[49:57] one or two people that come in the name
[50:00] of the Lord Jesus Christ he said I will
[50:03] be there amen it has nothing to do with
[50:05] me it has to do with his word and he
[50:07] will fulfill his

[50:23] father one when you see me you have seen
[50:25] the father he said says when you see the
[50:27] word made manifest you see the father
[50:31] because the word is the Father the word
[50:35] is God the word made manifest is God
[50:38] himself taking his word and making it
[50:40] manifest among Believers and nothing can
[50:44] make the word live but

[53:54] see Jesus Christ so we have the spirit
[53:57] of Christ right what the holy spirit is
[53:59] the spirit of Christ so if we have the
[54:01] spirit of Christ then we must have the
[54:03] same
[54:06] attributes amen right have the same
[54:09] attributes Jesus Christ no matter if he
[54:11] was in the storm or a gale and it was
[54:13] knocking the boat from one side to the
[54:15] other or he was standing in the face of
[54:17] a mess of demons if if he if he was
[54:20] hanging they was hanging everywhere it
[54:22] never moved
[54:25] him it never moved him he walked right
[54:29] on just as calm and quiet as he could be
[54:32] he was simply unconscious of fear or
[54:35] anything around
[54:39] him amen whether it was going to happen
[54:41] or whether it wasn't going to happen he
[54:43] knew it was going to happen because God
[54:46] said it was going to happen he didn't
[54:49] say oh I pray have I prayed through
[54:51] wonder if I fasted long enough wonder if
[54:53] I did this enough he just walked right
[54:55] on and CAU that's right he believed what
[54:58] God had said that was a truth the words
[55:01] must be
[55:04] fulfilled and he knew what his life was
[55:06] sent here for was to fulfill the word
[55:09] spoken of
[55:11] him and you are here to fulfill it
[55:18] too so if we got we understand the word
[55:21] spoke of me and what do you got to
[55:25] fear
[55:26] the word said I was going to
[55:30] overcome so what do you got to
[55:33] fear amen you know brother brand
[55:36] actually brother brother Eddie excuse me
[55:38] Eddie bisc was telling about the the
[55:40] story of the blind man in India being
[55:42] healed and brother brandom I believe
[55:43] talked with him about it I've been
[55:45] listening to some found some of the
[55:47] testimony brother Ed just going through
[55:49] him and and he said he said he said you
[55:52] know he saw him this man was a worshiper
[55:55] of the son lost his eyes we know the
[55:57] story he said but he saw him standing
[55:59] there healed in a but he said I and he
[56:04] he said actually I believe it was if I
[56:05] remember the story and the details
[56:07] exactly right but he saw this man was
[56:09] dark-headed but he saw a man this man
[56:11] heal but he had gray up coming up his up
[56:14] his around his ears like that so
[56:17] obviously you know you'd think well
[56:18] that's down the road he said brother
[56:21] random said I had to use my faith to
[56:23] believe that was going to happen right
[56:25] now
[56:27] he had to believe it no matter what
[56:29] anybody said any critics whatever I'm
[56:32] sure you know the devil was whispering
[56:33] in his ear cuz he was making a challenge
[56:36] between before their gods and the Living
[56:38] God but he had to believe that it's
[56:41] going to happen right now Jesus also had
[56:44] to believe the word spoken about him
[56:46] because it when he talked about his body
[56:48] not being broken and Bones not it didn't
[56:50] say Jesus it didn't mention his name he
[56:52] just spoke about it but he had to
[56:54] believe that is talking about me it
[56:57] don't talk they don't say Timothy was an
[56:59] overcomer Le to se or air or Tim PR or
[57:02] whoever but we have to believe that is
[57:05] talking about me and I must have the
[57:07] faith to fulfill that
[57:15] word I tell you I just while I'm here I
[57:19] I was listening to him talking about the

[57:36] hear he' F fell in some water and went
[57:37] to go find something and he said I
[57:39] opened my bag and he said there was
[57:42] that he said there was that crazy shirt
[57:46] and he said I started grumbling like my
[57:48] wife don't even listen to me I told her
[57:50] to throw it away and I wanted a new
[57:51] shirt for this hun I I wanted you know
[57:54] he said I wanted a red one or something
[57:55] he said and here she just fixed it
[57:57] mended it all up and he said here I am
[58:00] grumbling while I'm fulfilling a
[58:05] vision he said here I am complaining
[58:08] while the vision's being
[58:10] fulfilled amen that's what happens to us
[58:13] many times we get in life do you realize
[58:15] you're fulfilling a vision what the word
[58:18] has spoken about you and meanwhile you
[58:20] Grumble and you complain you're like why
[58:22] am I going through all this why is this
[58:24] happening meanwhile you're f fulfilling
[58:26] a

[58:31] care of it he's going to fulfill it and
[58:33] it's going to come to pass he'll go past
[58:36] your grumbling he'll go past your
[58:39] complaining cuz God's word will be
[58:44] fulfilled so we're here to fulfill it
[58:46] too so you walk unconscious of fear you
[58:49] walk unconscious of
[58:51] criticism that's a hard thing to
[58:53] do but walk unconscious of it walk
[58:57] unconscious to the world walk with
[58:59] Christ walk with him not paying any
[59:01] attention to the right or the left hand
[59:02] just keep moving on if something comes
[59:04] up to the church walk with
[59:07] God Amen if sickness strikes you walk

[59:58] God he says you'll have your ups and
[1:00:00] downs don't worry you'll go through your
[1:00:02] Brier patches and your sharp rocks and
[1:00:04] Bluffs and down over hillsides and up a

[1:00:23] seem to us when we step into that new
[1:00:25] body

[1:00:31] going to look when we step into that new
[1:00:33] body he has no more no more power to
[1:00:35] give us a mind battle or any disease and
[1:00:38] he's going to look so little we're going

[1:00:55] can't quit you can't give up you got to
[1:00:57] take another step and you keep walking
[1:00:59] this is the one that made me say the
[1:01:01] things I said and do the things that I

[1:01:12] general of of the Satan Lucifer

[1:01:25] different Tri tries we know that by the
[1:01:27] scripture we know that by the message of

[1:01:38] charge we're talking about the greatest
[1:01:40] of the greatest of their tribe we're

[1:01:59] amen when we see him kicked over into
[1:02:01] hell never to be no
[1:02:05] more we this was the
[1:02:17] one it becometh us to fulfill all
[1:02:24] righteousness in in other words it must
[1:02:27] be
[1:02:30] fulfilled he cannot allow one jot or one
[1:02:32] turle to not be fulfilled or otherwise
[1:02:35] he's told a
[1:02:37] lie God doesn't lie now man will make
[1:02:41] God lie I've heard many men or many
[1:02:42] women say God told me this and God told
[1:02:44] me that never come to pass they God's
[1:02:46] the biggest liar if you listen to men
[1:02:48] and women but if you listen to his word
[1:02:50] he don't lie that's amen it must be
[1:02:53] fulfilled all the word that God is
[1:02:55] spoken it must be fulfilled God cannot
[1:02:59] say anything somebody say anything
[1:03:02] anything without having it fulfill when
[1:03:04] he spoke it's a finished work it's
[1:03:07] already finished when God speaks
[1:03:10] it so take courage tonight ladies and
[1:03:13] gentlemen he said to him that
[1:03:17] overcometh it's
[1:03:19] finished it's as good as finished
[1:03:22] somebody's going to take that
[1:03:24] scripture somebody's going to be that
[1:03:27] one somebody or two or three or 100 or
[1:03:30] 100 th000 whatever it is amen somebody's
[1:03:33] going to become
[1:03:36] that cuz it won't go
[1:03:39] unfulfilled it's already finished God
[1:03:41] never speaks until he's ready for it to
[1:03:43] be when he speaks it's just as well has
[1:03:46] already happened amen if it wouldn't
[1:03:48] give us he said now if that wouldn't
[1:03:50] give us a basis to put our faith on this
[1:03:53] morning when God speaks a word it's
[1:03:59] finished he said why he said when he
[1:04:01] came 2,000 years ago he said why did he
[1:04:04] heal he said he healed not to show his
[1:04:07] power he healed to fulfill his
[1:04:10] word amen he's saved not to show his
[1:04:13] power he's saved to fulfill his word
[1:04:17] amen see God is concerned amen not so
[1:04:20] much about displaying his power but when
[1:04:22] his word is made manifest it will
[1:04:24] display his power
[1:04:26] amen it'll heal it'll deliver it'll set
[1:04:28] free it'll do all kinds of things but
[1:04:31] God cannot say anything without it being
[1:04:37] finished every one of us mortal men
[1:04:40] mortal women we can all say something we
[1:04:43] probably said it already down in our
[1:04:45] life and we ain't finished it
[1:04:48] [Music]
[1:04:49] yet yeah that was the
[1:04:52] truth yeah I got some things I ain't
[1:04:54] finished
[1:04:56] we all
[1:04:58] do God has some things that ain't
[1:05:00] finished but they will be you may not
[1:05:04] ever finish what you got going on or
[1:05:06] what you want to do or whatever but God
[1:05:08] will God's going to finish every part I
[1:05:11] I'm trying to drive that home because
[1:05:12] he's going to finish this
[1:05:15] bride he's not going to fall off at the
[1:05:18] end and and you know leave her here and
[1:05:20] oh well I couldn't get you out of here
[1:05:21] so you just got to go through the
[1:05:22] tribulation no God's going to get her
[1:05:24] out of here cuz he promised he would
[1:05:26] he it's written there so he has to do it
[1:05:29] or he's not God everything he said he
[1:05:32] will finish therefore when we receive
[1:05:34] the L word into our heart it's already
[1:05:38] done it's completed amen it's finished
[1:05:41] that's why when he said he said if this
[1:05:44] doesn't answer the question if that's
[1:05:45] why he then said be baptized many he
[1:05:47] said well why he was baptized because he
[1:05:49] was our example that's true in a certain
[1:05:52] State certain place true but that ain't
[1:05:54] all that wasn't all to the truth of it
[1:05:56] was he was the
[1:05:58] antitype now I looked up the definition
[1:06:01] of the antitype something serving as a
[1:06:04] model for what comes
[1:06:07] later so he came as an antitype amen
[1:06:11] showing that there's going to be more of
[1:06:13] me doing exactly what I'm doing coming
[1:06:17] later if I stay here as one man that's
[1:06:20] not my desire I have words to be
[1:06:23] fulfilled amen I have sayings to be
[1:06:25] filled I have I have something to be
[1:06:27] fulfilled in other lives and other
[1:06:29] people it can't just be in me therefore
[1:06:32] I must go that the comforter can come
[1:06:34] back and fill you with the faith to
[1:06:37] finish the
[1:06:39] word and this is where Peter was he
[1:06:42] couldn't finish it in his own self he
[1:06:44] tried he with all of his his grit and
[1:06:47] his tenacity that he had amen I'm going
[1:06:49] to do it I'm going to finish it I'm
[1:06:51] going to be the one I'll not go I'll go
[1:06:53] with you all the
[1:06:54] way
[1:06:56] he said you go before the crows
[1:06:57] three times you'll deny
[1:07:00] me before the crows through once
[1:07:03] you'll deny me
[1:07:06] Thrice no I ain't going to deny you
[1:07:08] ain't going to happen he spoke it Peter
[1:07:12] I'm sorry it's got to be
[1:07:14] fulfilled all your best intentions all
[1:07:17] you wanted all your flly desires you try
[1:07:20] to do everything you could you took a
[1:07:22] sword and I promise you he wasn't aiming
[1:07:24] for no ear
[1:07:27] not Peter he's going to take his head
[1:07:29] off cuz he's the man he's the
[1:07:32] leader but that wasn't way God wanted
[1:07:35] things he didn't want us to be leading
[1:07:38] by our fleshly desires and our wants no
[1:07:41] matter how good some of the attributes
[1:07:43] of our flesh can be that's not where he
[1:07:45] wants us to be led he wants us to be led
[1:07:47] by the spirit that's right let the
[1:07:50] spirit lead as it led him amen and so
[1:07:53] here he comes and he and he denies
[1:07:55] Christ and and he no doubt worded and
[1:07:57] like man I done did it now but when he
[1:07:59] when God when Jesus rose again he said
[1:08:02] go tell my disciples and Peter and he
[1:08:05] calls them all together amen he said
[1:08:07] because I need you to be in a place
[1:08:09] because I'm going to come back again not
[1:08:11] as who you see but as a spirit of God
[1:08:14] and I'm going to Endo you with
[1:08:17] power I'm going to Endo you with Faith
[1:08:20] from on high the same faith that got me
[1:08:22] to the Garden it got me through the
[1:08:24] garden they got Me to the Cross they got
[1:08:26] me to the Grave they got me out of the
[1:08:28] Grave I'm going to give you that same
[1:08:32] Faith to fulfill the word of
[1:08:37] God so he's the antitype he was the high
[1:08:40] priest that could be that before he
[1:08:43] could be anointed he had to be
[1:08:45] washed and we can go through it in air
[1:08:47] and how they had to wash him and then
[1:08:50] they could anoint him with the
[1:08:52] oil and will save time but here he was
[1:08:54] the very type of he said then he said
[1:08:58] even types the priest of the day we must
[1:09:00] be first baptized confess our sins and
[1:09:03] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:09:05] washing away our sins washing away all
[1:09:07] the old man going down a dead man and
[1:09:10] coming back up
[1:09:12] alive Hallelujah that we might receive
[1:09:15] this anointing the gift of the Holy
[1:09:17] Ghost wash first then anointing for
[1:09:19] service so he was showing us what it was
[1:09:22] to be amen and he was to fulfill all
[1:09:25] righteousness amen that righteousness
[1:09:27] was his word and and and he goes on he
[1:09:30] says see John you know who I am I'm the
[1:09:32] high priest that's true John I need to
[1:09:34] be baptized of thee you got to ful we
[1:09:37] got to fulfill our righteousness I need
[1:09:39] to be baptized of thee so I can fulfill
[1:09:42] the word of God because all the word has
[1:09:44] to be
[1:09:49] fulfilled all right we are and he said
[1:09:52] therefore we are also the lights of this
[1:09:54] day and it's up to us to fulfill all
[1:09:59] that's written of this
[1:10:03] day why do you think the devil's been
[1:10:05] after
[1:10:07] you because he's trying to make the word
[1:10:09] of no
[1:10:10] effect let just one drop fall to the
[1:10:13] ground one dot one tit that's what he's
[1:10:15] trying to do but he's not going to be
[1:10:17] successful because there's going to be
[1:10:19] some people that's going to fulfill the
[1:10:22] word amen he said the light of every age
[1:10:24] should do the same thing thing we know
[1:10:26] what is to be fulfilled You Are
[1:10:27] Spiritual and know the word of God you
[1:10:29] see what God has promised and the word
[1:10:31] will not come to pass just
[1:10:33] easy it won't be just easy amen you got
[1:10:37] but he said but you got to press your
[1:10:39] way into it to do it sometimes see it
[1:10:42] behooveth us it becometh us to fulfill
[1:10:44] all God's righteousness we must do it
[1:10:47] and he said if the Church of the Living
[1:10:49] God could only get that in their hearts
[1:10:52] and into their heads and their hearts
[1:10:54] that the church will not be separated by
[1:10:56] some denominational barrier that
[1:10:58] differences in Creeds and colors and so
[1:11:00] forth but that we might come together in
[1:11:03] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ not
[1:11:05] having anything to Bear us away from the
[1:11:07] true word of the Living God and walk
[1:11:09] straight down the line of scripture to
[1:11:12] fulfill all of God's
[1:11:15] righteousness of
[1:11:19] today why did Noah build an
[1:11:22] ark because it becometh him to fulfill
[1:11:25] feel he heard the word of God therefore
[1:11:28] he was commissioned to build an ark and
[1:11:31] he had to do what God's word said no
[1:11:33] matter how crazy it sounded how Wild it
[1:11:37] sounded how it was against science and
[1:11:39] everything that they had and all the
[1:11:41] stuff and the knowledge that they had he
[1:11:43] knew the plan of God and he was going to
[1:11:46] fulfill it because there was something
[1:11:47] on the inside of him to fulfill the word
[1:11:50] amen he got past all the education and
[1:11:53] all of his thoughts and all of his ideas
[1:11:55] and he started hammering on this Arc
[1:11:57] sure critics come cuz they had to
[1:12:00] fulfill their
[1:12:02] part that's why we have
[1:12:06] critics they have to fulfill the
[1:12:08] part we must pass through the Hall of
[1:12:12] critics they have to fulfill their
[1:12:16] part it's I mean I ain't trying to put
[1:12:19] anybody in the Hall of a Critic being a
[1:12:21] Critic they just are who they
[1:12:23] are just like Judas was who he
[1:12:27] was amen but Peter was also just who he
[1:12:30] was you are also just who you are amen
[1:12:34] you're fulfilling it why amen because
[1:12:37] God's word will come to pass and this is
[1:12:39] where he was this is where he was at he
[1:12:41] says brother you know he said he said we
[1:12:43] look at this and he said we know what we
[1:12:46] have we that are born again of the holy
[1:12:48] spirit of God we see his works right
[1:12:51] among us just like it was in the Bible
[1:12:53] times if you believe in that same Holy
[1:12:55] Spirit then why isn't he doing the same
[1:12:57] thing in your
[1:13:01] church well that's just a bunch of I'm
[1:13:03] just reading quote here it's just a
[1:13:05] bunch of mental workup it's just a bunch
[1:13:06] of emotion it it we can prove that that
[1:13:10] ain't really what it is no matter what
[1:13:11] scientific proofs are they can prove is
[1:13:14] just
[1:13:16] emotional quote that we're just mentally

[1:13:49] ark but this Ark is not for the
[1:13:53] tribulation that's right this Ark is for
[1:13:55] a

[1:18:45] and now start adding up a little bit
[1:18:48] amen but come on it becometh us to
[1:18:50] fulfill all
[1:18:53] righteousness
[1:18:56] those critics he said remember it's
[1:18:59] becoming to them to fulfill
[1:19:02] that because that also must be
[1:19:07] fulfilled but the word will remain the
[1:19:10] same when they're all
[1:19:14] gone Hallelujah and even churches will
[1:19:17] be no more God's word will ever remain
[1:19:21] the same and it becometh us to fulfill
[1:19:24] that
[1:19:26] righteousness amen so we must have the
[1:19:28] faith to fulfill it Noah it bothered him
[1:19:30] not he went right ahead with him because
[1:19:32] he knew God's program he knew what God
[1:19:34] was going to do he knew God's layout
[1:19:36] because he talked to God and it was
[1:19:37] according to the word of God he went
[1:19:39] right on done it anyhow whether science
[1:19:41] or criticism could prove otherwise
[1:19:42] matter not he stayed with God's word and
[1:19:44] he pounded right away why it was
[1:19:46] becoming of him to him because Noah was
[1:19:49] a prophet and it was it was ways
[1:19:51] becoming to him that he kept the word of
[1:19:54] God and he stayed with it it's becoming
[1:19:56] to any Prophet true prophet of God that
[1:19:58] he stays with the word and it's becoming
[1:20:02] to any Christian any Holy Ghost spirit
[1:20:04] filled Christian to stay with the word
[1:20:07] everything else may look easier it may
[1:20:09] look brighter and shinier this that and
[1:20:12] the other but beyond all of that stay
[1:20:14] with the
[1:20:17] word it's becoming to every Christian to
[1:20:19] Stand By God's word heavens and earth
[1:20:22] will pass away but it'll never pass away
[1:20:26] Enoch was a prophet Enoch knew that he
[1:20:29] was a
[1:20:30] type and he knew that before the floods
[1:20:33] came that he had to give an example so
[1:20:36] one afternoon it was becoming of him to
[1:20:39] take a
[1:20:41] walk it was becoming of him that he
[1:20:43] would take his walk with God and somehow
[1:20:46] that day he just changed path instead of
[1:20:49] going around that same side of the Hill
[1:20:51] he all of a sudden stepped on the King's
[1:20:53] Highway
[1:20:55] and he just kept on walking and they
[1:20:57] found him not why because it was
[1:20:59] becoming to him and he said oh God let
[1:21:02] me be like Enoch when the hour comes
[1:21:04] that I must take the path let me just
[1:21:07] step on to the King's Highway Hallelujah
[1:21:10] he said I can see Enoch as he knew it
[1:21:12] was becoming to him for he was a prophet
[1:21:14] and he knew what was going to happen he
[1:21:17] said see I can see him kiss his wife
[1:21:19] goodbye and say darling I'll see you
[1:21:21] later take up his children kiss them
[1:21:23] goodbye and go down to his marriage son
[1:21:24] his married daughter kissed him goodbye
[1:21:26] said where you going father you going
[1:21:28] out for a little walk yep just a little
[1:21:30] stroll but he never took that old
[1:21:32] familiar path that day he took the
[1:21:34] King's Highway and he went on to Glory
[1:21:37] it was becoming of him to do so he
[1:21:39] didn't want to leave but yet it was
[1:21:40] becoming of him to fulfill all
[1:21:42] righteousness because he was a type of
[1:21:45] the church today he was a type of the
[1:21:47] church that's going to take an afternoon
[1:21:49] stroll one of these days and one of
[1:21:51] these afternoons amen and they're going

[1:24:12] conviction don't let the devil push you
[1:24:14] off here or there you're always mudded
[1:24:16] up you're always off the main road
[1:24:18] you're always in and out you're always
[1:24:20] where you can't stand nowhere you can't
[1:24:22] have confidence in yourself much less
[1:24:24] any body else you can't no one can have

[1:24:32] stand
[1:24:34] therefore because it's becoming to you
[1:24:37] behooving you to do
[1:24:40] so it's becoming up to us to fulfill all
[1:24:48] righteousness we have some musicians to
[1:24:50] come he said old brandom Tabernacle what
[1:24:54] what kind of word would we give on the
[1:24:55] day of judgment when we've seen his
[1:24:57] mighty hand we've seen his power we've
[1:25:00] watched his glory we've seen what he
[1:25:02] said and it never fails we've seen his
[1:25:04] person the great Pillar of Fire the
[1:25:06] light hanging in the room here we've
[1:25:08] seen it Yonder science has taking his
[1:25:10] picture we hear the message go forth
[1:25:12] right straight to the line separate
[1:25:14] yourself don't ass associate with the
[1:25:16] unbelief it's becoming us that we
[1:25:19] fulfill all
[1:25:21] righteousness Abraham professed he was a
[1:25:23] pilgrim and a stranger Angy he had
[1:25:24] nothing to do he knew nobody on Earth he
[1:25:27] walked with God because it was becoming
[1:25:28] to him for he had seen him it was
[1:25:30] becoming to Abraham for when all the
[1:25:33] kings are out there you know and make
[1:25:34] him this great big guy and all this
[1:25:36] Abraham would have got this great
[1:25:38] Victory and the Kings would have met him
[1:25:39] and all the domination of barriers and
[1:25:41] all the things that could have take
[1:25:42] place but it was becoming for to him for
[1:25:45] he knew that God swore him swore to him
[1:25:48] I'll give you everywhere you look East
[1:25:52] North West South what did difference
[1:25:54] does it make whether we got a nickel or
[1:25:56] a
[1:25:59] dime whether we got something to eat or
[1:26:01] whether we have it whether we live in or
[1:26:04] whether we die and God promised the meek
[1:26:06] shall inherit the earth it behooveth us
[1:26:09] it becometh us that we live like it act
[1:26:11] like it must fulfill our righteousness
[1:26:14] God wants men and women who will stand
[1:26:16] and fulfill our righteousness of course
[1:26:18] righteousness is his word as I said at
[1:26:21] the beginning of the sermon that sermon
[1:26:23] Jesus would baptize the reason Jesus was
[1:26:25] baptized no matter how it was if he
[1:26:27] claimed to be the Son of God then he was
[1:26:28] baptized for the remission of sins he
[1:26:30] had none but he had to be washed because
[1:26:32] he was a high priest he had to fulfill
[1:26:34] all righteousness suffer it so John we
[1:26:37] must fulfill it we must we must do it we
[1:26:40] must suffer this to be
[1:26:43] so what was he saying I know if I do
[1:26:45] this I may
[1:26:47] suffer I may go through hard times I
[1:26:50] know I will but I must fulfill the word
[1:26:53] of God
[1:26:57] he said then I'll take the way with the
[1:26:59] Lord's despised few it's becoming to me
[1:27:02] to do so it's becoming to you as
[1:27:05] Servants of God that we take the way
[1:27:07] with the Lord's despised few we walk
[1:27:09] Godly righteously holy in this present
[1:27:13] life laying aside every weight that so
[1:27:16] easily beset us looking to the author
[1:27:19] and the finisher of our faith Jesus
[1:27:22] Christ it was becoming Abraham when he
[1:27:25] walked up there talking about Isaac and
[1:27:28] he took him up there and God showed him
[1:27:31] that he was going to that he was Jehovah
[1:27:33] Gyra but it was becoming to Abraham to
[1:27:35] fulfill all righteousness he knew what
[1:27:38] he was talking about he knew his God he
[1:27:40] knew what God Said God is able to
[1:27:42] perform what God's made promise God has
[1:27:44] made God is able to bring to keep to
[1:27:46] bring to pass no matter what he said
[1:27:48] it's becoming it was becoming to the
[1:27:50] disciples to go to that Upper Room
[1:27:54] why it was becoming because they had met
[1:27:58] a man a carpenter known to the
[1:28:00] World by a bad name
[1:28:05] illegitimate
[1:28:07] yub but they had seen this man heal the
[1:28:11] sick raise the dead cleanse the leper go
[1:28:15] to the calvary go to a grave and rise
[1:28:18] again and they seen him Ascend and it
[1:28:22] was becoming to do what he said go to
[1:28:26] Jerusalem T there and I'll send you
[1:28:28] power from on high it was becoming how
[1:28:31] long until how long will it be Lord just
[1:28:34] until until you're endued with power
[1:28:36] from on high then you will be my witness
[1:28:38] how long will it last under this
[1:28:40] generation under that generation as many
[1:28:43] as the Lord Our God will
[1:28:48] call I love that so it's becoming to us
[1:28:51] to still believe in
[1:28:53] Mercy amen amen it may not be becoming
[1:28:56] to you but it's becoming to me to still
[1:28:59] believe in Mercy and Grace and God's
[1:29:02] mercy and Grace in this hour it was
[1:29:04] becoming to them they went to the upper
[1:29:05] room because they had seen this power
[1:29:08] displayed they knew that he died and
[1:29:10] dead and they saw him put in the grave
[1:29:12] and they saw the Rocks belch out and
[1:29:14] they saw all these things plac but they
[1:29:16] they knew he was Messiah they saw him
[1:29:18] was
[1:29:20] sined and they said we got to go where
[1:29:22] he said go
[1:29:24] now there was there was a group there
[1:29:26] that
[1:29:28] didn't well the scripture say about 500
[1:29:31] that watched him sin there was only 120
[1:29:34] in the upper room according to scripture
[1:29:36] so what happened to the rest of them
[1:29:38] 380 it wasn't be coming to them but
[1:29:41] those 120 caught a revelation they
[1:29:44] caught something on the inside to go
[1:29:46] there he said unto a man and woman
[1:29:48] experiences what was becoming to them
[1:29:51] the Holy Ghost then they'll know what
[1:29:53] they they're talking about and they'll
[1:29:55] and they'll know what they're living
[1:29:57] about and you'll know that you that it's
[1:29:59] not just excitement it's not just the
[1:30:02] power but it's the power of God into
[1:30:03] salvation it's the Holy Ghost I know
[1:30:05] what I'm speaking of it behooveth the it
[1:30:08] was behooving to the disciples it was
