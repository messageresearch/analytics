[57:20] bless you this morning isn't it good to
[57:21] be in the house of the Lord amen and I
[57:25] know we had expected brother at Tim to
[57:27] be ministering this morning but he came
[57:29] down Sick and asked me to to fill in so
[57:32] so here we are so let's just all get
[57:34] into the word together and and and enjoy
[57:37] the word of God together amen we're
[57:39] going to turn to the scriptures this
[57:41] morning into the book of Colossians the
[57:44] first chapter Colossians the first
[57:46] chapter and once again I have a a
[57:48] PowerPoint that I put together just
[57:50] because I do have a lot of of of
[57:53] scriptures and quotes and I just felt
[57:54] like the quotes were necessary to really
[57:57] drive home the points that I was trying
[57:58] to make and hopefully help you to to
[58:01] stay with me and follow it so so we'll
[58:03] be using that this morning and I'll also
[58:05] make it much easier on those in in the
[58:09] in the booth
[58:11] so I don't know if you can read that or
[58:16] not me neither so while they're working
[58:19] on that I'm just going to go ahead and
[58:21] we'll just read we'll read the scripture
[58:22] together Colossians 1
[58:24] and13 it says who hath delivered us from
[58:27] the power of darkness and hath
[58:29] translated us into the kingdom of his
[58:31] dear son in whom we have Redemption
[58:34] through his blood even the Forgiveness
[58:36] of sins verse 15 who is the image of the
[58:41] invisible God the firstborn of every
[58:44] creature for by him were all things
[58:47] created that are in heaven and that are
[58:48] in Earth visible and invisible whether
[58:52] they be Thrones or dominions or
[58:54] principalities or powers
[58:56] all things were created by Him and for
[58:59] him and he is before all things and by
[59:03] him all things consist I want you to
[59:06] look there in verse 15 again at the
[59:09] beginning and it said who is the image
[59:11] of the invisible God we're also going to
[59:15] read one verse in in 1 Timothy 1 and
[59:18] 17 it says now unto the king Eternal
[59:22] Immortal
[59:23] invisible the only wise God God be honor
[59:27] and Glory forever and ever amen amen I
[59:31] pray that the Lord will add His
[59:32] blessings to the reading of the word as
[59:34] you take your
[59:35] seats I'd like to speak to you for a for
[59:38] a moment on the
[59:41] Unseen becoming
[59:43] manifest the Unseen becoming manifest
[59:46] another way we might could put this
[59:48] would be the invisible being made
[59:51] visible amen so the word makes it plain
[59:55] here and I believe that we all
[59:56] understand that God is a spirit and and
[1:00:00] being a spirit he is invisible John 4:24
[1:00:04] tells us that that God is a spirit and
[1:00:06] we just read here in first Timothy that
[1:00:08] he's invisible so so we worship an
[1:00:12] invisible God we worship an invisible
[1:00:14] God today and and if we were to if we
[1:00:16] were to go back in in in time as it were
[1:00:18] and look at the beginning of the Bible
[1:00:20] we would see there in Genesis the first
[1:00:23] chapter that it starts out as he begins
[1:00:25] to create the heavens and he begins to
[1:00:28] create the Earth but if we would go back
[1:00:31] before that if we would go back before
[1:00:34] time began one one place brother
[1:00:36] brandham actually says let's take a trip
[1:00:39] a hundred million years before there
[1:00:41] ever was a star a moon or anything we're
[1:00:45] up and running all right let me get to
[1:00:48] where we
[1:00:51] are we already read the scriptures
[1:00:53] didn't we all right so that's where
[1:00:54] we're at he says let's go back a 100
[1:00:57] million years before there was time or
[1:00:59] or before there was a star a moon or
[1:01:01] anything because see there was a time
[1:01:04] and we use the word time there Loosely
[1:01:06] because it's Before Time began but just
[1:01:08] for our understanding there was a time
[1:01:10] where there was nothing that there there
[1:01:13] was a time where where nothing existed
[1:01:15] and it's hard for us to wrap our minds
[1:01:17] around that because we have always known
[1:01:20] time to exist we we we Mark time we Mark
[1:01:24] birthdays we Mark anniversaries we mark
[1:01:25] Mark years we Mark days we Mark hours we
[1:01:28] were born we die we've always known time
[1:01:31] to exist we've always known the world to
[1:01:33] exist we've always known things to be
[1:01:36] tangible something that we can touch and
[1:01:38] so it's hard for us to wrap our minds
[1:01:40] around the fact that there was nothing
[1:01:44] there was nothing but what we're talking
[1:01:46] about is is before there was anything
[1:01:48] but before any of this and even before
[1:01:51] God was God you say well God's always
[1:01:54] been god well not not really because if
[1:01:56] you go back before creation God being an
[1:01:58] object of worship there was nothing to
[1:02:00] worship him so God wasn't God he he was
[1:02:05] because he he dwelt alone he was by
[1:02:07] himself he was in this nothingness in in
[1:02:10] this great big vastness of Eternity and
[1:02:12] he was invisible but I want you to know
[1:02:15] that all that God
[1:02:18] was all that God was ever going to be
[1:02:22] all of his word which is himself he
[1:02:26] wanted
[1:02:27] manifested he wanted it to be manifested
[1:02:30] and and even in that that I just said
[1:02:32] all that he was all of his attributes
[1:02:34] all of his thinking this great eternal
[1:02:36] spirit wanted it to be manifested so
[1:02:38] that he would become God it was in him
[1:02:41] to be a Healer it was in him to be a
[1:02:43] savior it was in him to be a father it
[1:02:46] was in him and he wanted this to be
[1:02:49] manifested so even then when he dwelt
[1:02:52] alone he wanted you manifested he wanted
[1:02:56] you on the earth he wanted you to come
[1:02:58] forth out of him he wanted to be
[1:03:01] manifested so going back now to that
[1:03:04] place before there was anything brother
[1:03:06] brandham says and there that great space
[1:03:10] where no one can fathom I can amen that
[1:03:13] right now I I can't I can't understand
[1:03:15] it but he says where no one can fathom
[1:03:18] in their mind beyond that that space
[1:03:20] eternity that's Jehovah God out there he
[1:03:24] says and we're taught in the beginning
[1:03:26] that the logos or the Son of God went
[1:03:30] out of God so we got to get this clear
[1:03:34] today so the
[1:03:35] logos was a part of God that went out
[1:03:38] from God so so it comes out of God and
[1:03:42] and brother brandham says it was his
[1:03:43] first body form he said the Loos was his
[1:03:48] first body form he would describe it as
[1:03:50] a as a little white light or as a Halo
[1:03:54] it's incredible you know I was was
[1:03:55] thinking about this as I studied how how
[1:03:57] people read and guess and wonder and
[1:04:00] Ponder and yet we had a prophet says it
[1:04:02] was like a little white light it was
[1:04:04] like a Halo who else can say hey let's
[1:04:06] take a trip a hundred million years
[1:04:08] before there was anything and you don't
[1:04:10] say well he's making this up you say
[1:04:11] yeah I'm going with this guy I'm going
[1:04:14] with him because I know we're fit we're
[1:04:15] taking a trip and we got a tour guy that
[1:04:17] knows what he's talking about but he
[1:04:19] says it was like a little white light or
[1:04:22] a Halo and it was the son of God it was
[1:04:27] the word of God the logos that would
[1:04:30] become flesh do we all understand that
[1:04:32] amen so as the logos comes out of God
[1:04:35] this light would be the first time that
[1:04:38] you could describe God as visible right
[1:04:42] it's the first time that you could use
[1:04:44] that to describe him because we know the
[1:04:47] spirit of God is invisible but this
[1:04:50] light this logos this part that was of
[1:04:53] him was a visible manifest ation of God
[1:04:57] it was the Unseen becoming manifest the
[1:05:00] invisible becoming visible it's the word
[1:05:03] of God the Son of God it's what became
[1:05:06] flesh and dwelt amongst us and brother
[1:05:08] brandham says so he first was god
[1:05:12] Jehovah and out of him let's just
[1:05:14] picture now as a little drama so you can
[1:05:17] get it let's see coming out of space
[1:05:19] where there's nothing let's make it a
[1:05:21] little white light like a Mystic light
[1:05:23] like a Halo and that was the low go that
[1:05:26] went out of God in the beginning that
[1:05:27] was the son of God that came out of the
[1:05:29] bosom of the father that was what was in
[1:05:32] the beginning was the
[1:05:33] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:05:36] Word was God and the Word was made flesh
[1:05:39] and dwelt Among Us in the beginning was
[1:05:41] God and then out of God came the logos a
[1:05:45] part of God that went out of God he says
[1:05:48] sitting way back in eternity that was
[1:05:51] God and then going out of God or God
[1:05:53] unfolding himself and we're going to use
[1:05:56] that term more unfolding himself come to
[1:05:58] logos which was the son of God or the
[1:06:01] word of God in the beginning was the
[1:06:03] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:06:05] Word was God and the Word was made flesh
[1:06:07] and dwelt Among Us the
[1:06:10] logos amen so so I want I want to make a
[1:06:12] point here that the word of God will
[1:06:16] always be
[1:06:17] manifest the word of God will always be
[1:06:21] manifest the word will always produce
[1:06:24] the word will not remain unseen the word
[1:06:28] will not remain unfulfilled in other
[1:06:31] words it can't be sent out from him and
[1:06:33] then return back empty it won't be sent
[1:06:35] out and then return back is nothing if
[1:06:37] it said that the logos went out of him
[1:06:40] and there's nothing well there was
[1:06:42] nothing and his word went forth and
[1:06:44] there was still nothing but that can't
[1:06:46] happen the logos went out of him and
[1:06:48] suddenly it made manifest and there was
[1:06:51] a visible manifestation when the word is
[1:06:54] released it will become manifest it will
[1:06:59] be
[1:07:00] fulfilled when the logos came forth
[1:07:02] immediately we have visibility we have
[1:07:05] manifestation we can we have something
[1:07:08] that we can see and say that's
[1:07:11] God we can see it John
[1:07:14] 1 now as we're still dealing with the
[1:07:17] logos John
[1:07:19] 1 and one it says in the beginning was
[1:07:21] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:07:24] the word was God now we we take this
[1:07:29] scripture and we go right down to verse
[1:07:31] 14 and it says and the Word was made
[1:07:33] flesh and dwelt among us and we connect
[1:07:35] those two it just makes sense the word
[1:07:38] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:07:39] was with God the Word was God and the
[1:07:41] Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:07:43] that doesn't confuse us at all we see
[1:07:46] who Jesus was we see who that flesh was
[1:07:51] but some read that in the nominal world
[1:07:53] trinitarians and they read that part
[1:07:55] that says was with God and they make it
[1:07:59] two separate things like Joe was with
[1:08:03] Aaron so the word was with God and they
[1:08:07] read that and they see oh well there's
[1:08:08] two there we see that that there's two
[1:08:12] but and they make it two different
[1:08:14] persons that are co-equal and co-eternal
[1:08:16] but this language doesn't indicate
[1:08:19] another person being with God it is an
[1:08:22] indication that God has changed forms
[1:08:26] okay that's what it's saying the logos
[1:08:28] has come forth from God and that logos
[1:08:31] is now visible he is gone from visible
[1:08:35] to invis excuse me from invisible to
[1:08:38] visible or simply simply put there's
[1:08:41] another expression of
[1:08:43] God it's still one but there's another
[1:08:46] expression of him he is manifested as
[1:08:50] I'll bring it up to our terminology the
[1:08:52] pillar of
[1:08:53] fire he is manifested Ed himself when
[1:08:56] Moses met God in the burning bush what
[1:08:59] what did he see this
[1:09:00] logos the pillar of fire it was a
[1:09:03] visible form the invisible the Unseen
[1:09:06] had become manifest the word didn't come
[1:09:09] forth out of him and nothing
[1:09:11] happened oh come on now start thinking
[1:09:14] about the word that you're holding on
[1:09:15] for think about the promises that you're
[1:09:18] holding on for God's word always brings
[1:09:22] forth God's word always manest to to the
[1:09:26] human eye the promise may still be
[1:09:29] invisible it it's just a promise if I
[1:09:31] say I promise I'm going to do this until
[1:09:34] I do it it's still
[1:09:36] invisible it it's just a word it's only
[1:09:39] a word but the Fulfillment of the
[1:09:41] promise makes it become visible the
[1:09:44] Fulfillment of the promise is what makes
[1:09:47] it become visible brother Bram says here
[1:09:49] and now I can see him as he moves over
[1:09:52] here and draws his memory draws into his
[1:09:56] memory or his mind a picture of what the
[1:09:59] world should be now there's not a star
[1:10:02] or
[1:10:03] nothing and I read this quote and it
[1:10:05] just it was it was so awesome to me as
[1:10:07] he he's sitting there talking about
[1:10:09] drawing a picture and I just thought
[1:10:10] it's the master
[1:10:12] architect it's the master architect
[1:10:15] sitting there drawing up the plans he
[1:10:17] he's drawing it up in his mind and at
[1:10:19] this point right here it still says
[1:10:21] there's not a star or nothing but at
[1:10:24] this point it's all already done because
[1:10:27] he's already thought it and his thoughts
[1:10:30] are perfect and so at this point it's as
[1:10:33] good is done he's thought it the the
[1:10:35] Earth has been thought of and guess what
[1:10:38] you was in the earth why' he even make
[1:10:40] the Earth he made the Earth to take you
[1:10:43] out of the earth so at this point as he
[1:10:46] thinks that it's already done the Earth
[1:10:48] is done you are there in the earth he
[1:10:52] made the Earth to take you out of so so
[1:10:54] you're an attribute that was in his
[1:10:56] thinking and so is this Earth that's why
[1:10:58] he redeems the Earth the Earth was part
[1:11:01] of him Satan don't get this Earth God
[1:11:04] redeems this Earth you're part of this
[1:11:06] Earth Jesus Christ's body was part of
[1:11:09] this Earth so he redeems the Earth the
[1:11:11] same way he redeems you but in his mind
[1:11:14] right here at this point the Earth all
[1:11:16] of creation you Redemption it's all
[1:11:19] finished it's all over with It's Already
[1:11:22] Done why why can we sing that because
[1:11:25] was already done right here before the
[1:11:27] first star was ever
[1:11:29] created he say I can hear him say let
[1:11:32] there be light and an Adam bursted
[1:11:34] Yonder and the Sun come into existence
[1:11:37] deity oh yeah she began to whirl
[1:11:40] millions of years rolled by and after a
[1:11:43] while a piece flew off of I love this so
[1:11:46] much you can just visualize a piece flew
[1:11:48] off of it star and he stood out there
[1:11:52] and watched it and it went all down and
[1:11:54] he stopped it over here after it fell a
[1:11:55] few million
[1:11:58] years off went another one he let it
[1:12:00] fall near a certain place and he stopped
[1:12:02] it what's he doing he's got it in his
[1:12:05] mind
[1:12:06] now that someday there'll be an earth
[1:12:10] there'll be a mankind on the earth he
[1:12:14] said let there be it didn't matter how
[1:12:18] long it
[1:12:19] took it was going to be made manifest
[1:12:22] the invisible was going to become
[1:12:24] visible it didn't matter if it took
[1:12:26] millions and millions or billions and
[1:12:28] billions of years once he said let it be
[1:12:31] those thoughts were in his mind they
[1:12:32] were invisible only thought but once he
[1:12:34] released that word once he said let
[1:12:38] there be and even still it was had you
[1:12:40] been there to hear it it would have
[1:12:42] still been
[1:12:43] invisible it would have still been
[1:12:45] invisible but the Unseen was going to
[1:12:48] become manifested the invisible was
[1:12:51] going to become visible the word was
[1:12:53] going to take on the form of what it was
[1:12:56] spoke to be let there be light nothing
[1:13:00] could stop it it was going to be light
[1:13:03] it might have taken a long time but it
[1:13:06] was coming stars were coming the Earth
[1:13:09] was coming man was coming the promises
[1:13:12] are coming it's already been spoken the
[1:13:15] healing is on the way Deliverance is
[1:13:17] coming the Rapture is coming your
[1:13:19] Victory is coming Joy is coming
[1:13:22] overcoming power it's coming the visible
[1:13:25] will be made
[1:13:27] visible the Unseen will be made manifest
[1:13:30] the word's been released it's on its
[1:13:33] way it may take a long time but it's on
[1:13:37] its
[1:13:38] way Hallelujah it will manifest what it
[1:13:42] was spoken to
[1:13:44] manifest your Victory is coming
[1:13:48] Hallelujah you know the thing is I know
[1:13:50] it's written down in the Bible and
[1:13:51] that's good I know it it's in our hearts
[1:13:54] in that that's
[1:13:55] good but I would begin taking that
[1:13:58] word and putting it on my lips for my
[1:14:02] situation and I would begin releasing
[1:14:05] that word out of my mouth the prophet of
[1:14:08] God told us that when you take the word
[1:14:10] on the lips of a born again son or
[1:14:12] daughter of God and they release that
[1:14:15] word it's the same as deity speaking he
[1:14:19] said every Mountain's got to move he
[1:14:21] said Satan can't stand before that man
[1:14:23] and if that word released from the lips
[1:14:25] of deity created galaxies created worlds
[1:14:29] and I can take the same word and put it
[1:14:31] on these lips it's the same is don't
[1:14:33] tell me depression won't crumble don't
[1:14:36] tell me anxiety won't flee don't tell me
[1:14:38] homes can't be restored don't tell me
[1:14:41] relationships can't be created galaxies
[1:14:44] formed by the word take the word release
[1:14:47] the word speak what you have need
[1:14:51] of Every Mountain has to move
[1:14:55] release the word and when you release it
[1:14:57] it'll be
[1:14:58] invisible but watch it create a visible
[1:15:01] victory in your
[1:15:03] life hallelujah oh yes
[1:15:07] manifest what does manifest
[1:15:11] mean manifest means clear to the eye to
[1:15:15] make evident or certain by
[1:15:19] showing or
[1:15:23] displaying a promise isn't
[1:15:26] manifest until it
[1:15:30] happens now if I'm speaking about the
[1:15:33] past I just want to differentiate the
[1:15:35] two and I tell you something happened
[1:15:38] that did not happen that that's just a
[1:15:40] that's a flat out lie not only is it not
[1:15:43] true it's a lie lie has a lot to do with
[1:15:48] intention I tell you this happened this
[1:15:50] happened this happened it didn't that's
[1:15:51] a lie we know everything that God has
[1:15:54] said happened has happened it is the
[1:15:57] truth but when we're speaking of
[1:16:02] future anything that I tell you is going
[1:16:05] to happen the truth of that is yet to be
[1:16:09] determined you can't tell me if it's a
[1:16:11] lie or the truth till we get to the
[1:16:13] appointed time the appointed day and
[1:16:16] whether or not I told you what was going
[1:16:17] to happen happens or not no matter what
[1:16:20] it it it doesn't happen then it wasn't
[1:16:23] true regardless of my intention I don't
[1:16:27] mean I was lying but if I tell you
[1:16:29] because it may have been in man I'm
[1:16:30] going to come help you do this on Monday
[1:16:32] and then I'll my car breaks
[1:16:36] down I didn't show
[1:16:38] up now I was going to but I did not
[1:16:42] therefore the statement was not true do
[1:16:45] you follow what I'm saying it wasn't
[1:16:47] truth because truth is found in the
[1:16:49] manifestation truth is found in
[1:16:52] fulfillment do you understand so so so
[1:16:55] it's not truth if it doesn't happen
[1:16:58] physical words spoken or written have no
[1:17:00] truth to them until it happens in other
[1:17:04] words the the manifestation of those
[1:17:06] words have to come into something
[1:17:08] tangible they have to come into
[1:17:10] fulfillment that's what makes them truth
[1:17:13] and that goes for everyone that goes for
[1:17:17] god brother Bram tells us God is only as
[1:17:20] good as his
[1:17:21] word he says if God made a promise Pro
[1:17:25] God's got to keep his promise if he
[1:17:28] doesn't he isn't
[1:17:30] God he says that's the way you do with
[1:17:32] healing throw yourself at his Mercy he
[1:17:35] promised it it's his word he's got to
[1:17:39] he's got to fulfill his word if he isn't
[1:17:42] he isn't
[1:17:45] God he says in no man's word no man is
[1:17:48] any better than his word if I don't keep
[1:17:51] my word I'm not much and if God doesn't
[1:17:54] keep his word word he isn't God but if
[1:17:56] God does keep his word how many can
[1:17:59] testify that God keeps his word but if
[1:18:02] God does keep his word then he ever
[1:18:05] remains God in order to be God he's got
[1:18:07] to keep his word you see he's got to
[1:18:10] keep his word I'm trying to drill that
[1:18:12] into you today he's going to keep his
[1:18:14] word he's going to see you through he's
[1:18:16] going to do what he promised to do he's
[1:18:18] never not kept his word he's always
[1:18:21] going to keep his word he's God he's
[1:18:23] trustworthy he's a faithful and true
[1:18:27] witness he's going to keep his
[1:18:30] word see I can tell you like I said that
[1:18:33] I'm G to I'm going to come help you do
[1:18:35] something on
[1:18:38] Thursday and I can mean it with all my
[1:18:41] heart and every intention can be perfect
[1:18:44] and
[1:18:45] pure and yet due to unforeseen
[1:18:47] circumstances I'm unable to come through
[1:18:49] on my
[1:18:53] promise but what makes God different and
[1:18:56] I love this as I was
[1:18:57] studying is his promise can never be
[1:19:00] derailed by
[1:19:01] circumstances circumstance can derail
[1:19:04] what I want to do or what I plan to do
[1:19:07] but circumstances can never derail what
[1:19:11] God's plans are because he isn't
[1:19:14] confined by time he isn't confined by
[1:19:17] space then his promises are not subject
[1:19:20] to circumstance because he speaks them
[1:19:22] from a place of already
[1:19:25] happened think about it he doesn't say
[1:19:28] I'm going to heal you so there's a
[1:19:29] chance it can be derailed he says you
[1:19:32] are healed I have saved you I have
[1:19:35] delivered you I have come down he's not
[1:19:38] even speaking of I will he's telling you
[1:19:40] what I've already done the promise can't
[1:19:43] be broke he's already fulfilled it he
[1:19:45] already took the stripes he already
[1:19:47] healed you he already delivered you it's
[1:19:50] already
[1:19:52] done how can circumstance derail
[1:19:54] something that's
[1:19:55] finished hallelujah hallelujah you're
[1:19:58] already saved you're already going to
[1:20:00] Rapture you've already been healed the
[1:20:02] work's already finished it can't be
[1:20:05] derailed you can't fall away You're
[1:20:07] predestinated to it
[1:20:12] Hallelujah he says I healed you I saved
[1:20:14] you I delivered you I was the lamb slain
[1:20:18] before the foundation of the world by
[1:20:21] whose Stripes you were
[1:20:25] healed he's already fulfilled the
[1:20:27] promise that he's given
[1:20:29] you even if it still is invisible to
[1:20:32] your eyes but the invisible is going to
[1:20:35] become
[1:20:36] visible
[1:20:38] Hallelujah it may be unseen right
[1:20:41] now it may still be be somewhere you
[1:20:44] can't quite see it it may be blurry off
[1:20:46] in the distance but the Unseen is going
[1:20:49] to be manifest because the word has been
[1:20:51] released and it has already accomplished
[1:20:54] its goal go right
[1:20:57] Hallelujah what's that mean brother
[1:20:59] Aaron that means you're dealing with a
[1:21:01] defeated
[1:21:02] enemy he's already fought the War he's
[1:21:06] already defeated the War I mean how
[1:21:08] silly would it sound if I came to you
[1:21:10] and said guys listen we really got to
[1:21:12] defeat the Nazis in World War
[1:21:16] II I I'm worried about this brother Joe
[1:21:18] we got to stop them if we don't guys we
[1:21:21] done fought that war they're already a
[1:21:24] defeated enemy there may be imagery and
[1:21:26] there may be hate speech and things that
[1:21:28] linger from it and come and try to rise
[1:21:30] its ugly head up again but they have
[1:21:33] been defeated I'm telling you Satan's
[1:21:35] defeated death is defeated sickness is
[1:21:38] defeated depression is defeated the
[1:21:40] grave is defeated It's Already Done he's
[1:21:44] a defeated enemy this morning and now
[1:21:47] you're just waiting for the Unseen to
[1:21:49] become manifest in your life which it
[1:21:51] will
[1:21:58] Hallelujah we can Rejoice today that the
[1:22:00] Unseen will be made manifest
[1:22:04] yes
[1:22:07] hallelujah what good does it do
[1:22:09] us what good does it do is to talk about
[1:22:13] the Miracles if he isn't still a miracle
[1:22:17] worker he's an eternal god with an
[1:22:19] eternal word what good is it to talk
[1:22:21] about the blood if the blood's lost its
[1:22:23] power
[1:22:25] what good is it to to re to recount the
[1:22:27] promises if they aren't any good
[1:22:32] anymore I need God
[1:22:34] today I mean don't get me wrong I'm
[1:22:36] super thankful that the Red Sea opened
[1:22:38] for the
[1:22:39] Israelites I I'm happy for him man I'm
[1:22:42] super thankful for every person that
[1:22:44] that received a touch in the prophet of
[1:22:46] God's meetings I'm I'm happy you it
[1:22:49] showed God alive it manifested the
[1:22:51] invisible but I need God today yeah it
[1:22:55] it's something to me that the very theme
[1:22:57] of our message was Jesus Christ the same
[1:23:00] yesterday today and forever and yet we
[1:23:03] want to change him well he's the same
[1:23:05] yesterday today forever except for the
[1:23:07] way he manifest himself in the
[1:23:09] services except for the fact that we
[1:23:11] don't need prayer lines no more well I
[1:23:13] just look at like feels good enough for
[1:23:15] the prophets good enough for
[1:23:16] me I mean maybe you've risen above his
[1:23:19] level I'm just saying if it was good
[1:23:20] enough then it's good enough now if God
[1:23:22] healed then God heals now if God
[1:23:25] manifested in gifts then he'll manifest
[1:23:27] in gifts now God is God in every single
[1:23:31] way brother Brown would tell us in every
[1:23:33] single detail except his Corporal body
[1:23:36] nothing's changed then what's
[1:23:39] changed not
[1:23:43] him not
[1:23:45] him he's the same and we need him to be
[1:23:48] the same he he's still God his word is
[1:23:51] still true every promise will come to
[1:23:53] pass exactly as he said it will now
[1:23:56] here's the thing I want you to get I'm
[1:23:58] not telling you that that this is what
[1:24:00] brings
[1:24:01] Faith it's faith in the
[1:24:04] Unseen that makes it
[1:24:07] seen do you understand what I'm saying
[1:24:09] I'm not saying we have to see in order
[1:24:10] to believe it's faith in the invisible
[1:24:13] is what's going to make it visible it's
[1:24:16] faith when you don't see faith comes by
[1:24:19] hearing but we hear and we believe and
[1:24:22] therefore we will see
[1:24:25] it manifests itself it doesn't remain
[1:24:29] invisible brother brandham tells us he
[1:24:31] says now if God makes a promise in the
[1:24:33] Bible and then if you receive that the
[1:24:36] supernatural promise will make a
[1:24:38] supernatural manifestation
[1:24:41] Hallelujah because God will vindicate
[1:24:44] his word
[1:24:46] absolutely Hallelujah he will vindicate
[1:24:49] it absolutely we can stop and rejoice
[1:24:51] right there whatever you're holding on
[1:24:53] to whatever piece of that word he's the
[1:24:55] Lord God that Health thee you're holding
[1:24:58] on for the Holy Ghost the promise is
[1:24:59] unto you you're holding on for a prodal
[1:25:02] he will vindicate his word absolutely
[1:25:06] it's a supernatural promise you hold on
[1:25:09] and a supernatural manifestation will
[1:25:11] take place I don't know how it's going
[1:25:13] to happen me neither because it's
[1:25:15] supernatural if you could figure it out
[1:25:17] it wouldn't be it's all Supernatural
[1:25:19] Well I don't see how this is going to
[1:25:21] happen this is going to happen me
[1:25:22] neither don't have to it's a great point
[1:25:24] don't got to figure it out all I got to
[1:25:26] do is have faith in the Unseen and the
[1:25:28] Unseen will become visible and manifest
[1:25:31] itself in a victory in my
[1:25:35] life his word is always made
[1:25:43] manifest we know faith comes by
[1:25:46] hearing we know that and we believe that
[1:25:48] we do not have to see the Bel but we're
[1:25:51] going to see because we have heard and
[1:25:54] we believed that's the reason why and we
[1:25:58] have example after example in the
[1:26:01] scriptures of those who would look to
[1:26:03] the Unseen with faith and therefore the
[1:26:05] Unseen became seen Noah saw the waters
[1:26:09] Fallen by faith before they ever fell
[1:26:12] never seen a cloud
[1:26:14] before nothing but blue
[1:26:17] skies I'd like about a week of
[1:26:20] that I'm sure it's coming in August and
[1:26:23] I'll be like where's the clouds but I'm
[1:26:25] just talking about right
[1:26:26] now never seen rain before nothing but
[1:26:30] blue skies but God released a
[1:26:33] word that said it's going to rain now at
[1:26:35] that point there's no turning
[1:26:37] back that word has been
[1:26:40] released and it didn't matter that it
[1:26:42] took 120 years brother Aaron I've been
[1:26:44] battling this so long that's part of it
[1:26:48] I told you at the beginning we're time
[1:26:50] creatures we're dealing with time how
[1:26:52] many days have I been sick how many
[1:26:53] weeks how how long have they been out of
[1:26:55] church how long has this marriage been
[1:26:57] in this Con time no the word's been
[1:27:00] released wait for the manifestation and
[1:27:03] hold on and expect
[1:27:05] it it was a word that that remained
[1:27:08] invisible for 120 years but at the time
[1:27:12] appointed it became
[1:27:14] visible and because Noah believed that
[1:27:17] God's word must come to pass then he was
[1:27:20] prepared for it now that's the thing I
[1:27:22] want to stop and say something about
[1:27:24] about real quick is how much action you
[1:27:27] go into after you receive the promise
[1:27:29] shows whether or not you truly believe
[1:27:31] the promise Noah could have said for 120
[1:27:34] years I believe it's going to rain and
[1:27:36] he could have preached it but had he not
[1:27:38] buil the ark it would have proved he did
[1:27:41] not believe it was going to
[1:27:44] happen how much you're preparing to
[1:27:47] receive what you're asking for shows how
[1:27:50] much you
[1:27:51] believe you think about Zachariah and
[1:27:54] the Temple when when the angel came and
[1:27:55] told him about John's birth do you
[1:27:58] realize that that's what Zachariah had
[1:27:59] been praying for they'd been praying for
[1:28:02] it and the angel comes and says well
[1:28:03] you're going to get it and he goes can't
[1:28:07] be think about are we expecting to
[1:28:11] receive what we've asked
[1:28:14] for I you know how it
[1:28:16] is maybe I'll take guys men and women if
[1:28:20] you got company coming over a big thing

[1:29:02] don't believe yes I can your action on
[1:29:04] the promise tells me whether or not you
[1:29:07] [Music]
[1:29:09] believe do you get prepared to receive
[1:29:12] it are you expecting not hoping
[1:29:16] expecting to receive it I'm not hoping

[1:29:31] putting my all into it I believe you
[1:29:34] Lord he's coming back just like he
[1:29:37] [Applause]
[1:29:43] said expectation means to believe that
[1:29:46] someone or something will arrive
[1:29:52] soon this word don't don't fail we ought
[1:29:55] to be under expectation every single day
[1:29:58] every single service today is the
[1:30:00] Fulfillment today is my Deliverance
[1:30:03] today is the manifestation of what I've
[1:30:05] been praying for didn't happen that's
[1:30:07] okay today is you wake up the next day
[1:30:10] today I'm under
[1:30:12] expectation we should live under
[1:30:15] expectation thus far it's unseen by my
[1:30:18] natural eye but I'm expecting because I
[1:30:21] know the word will bring the promise
[1:30:23] into manifest estation for 25
[1:30:26] years the the promised son was only
[1:30:29] visible in a
[1:30:31] confession it was only visible by faith
[1:30:34] but there was coming a time where
[1:30:37] Abraham would hold that confession in
[1:30:39] his
[1:30:41] arms it had to be made manifest he would
[1:30:45] hold the confession in his arms listen
[1:30:48] that's what I'm preaching to you this
[1:30:49] morning the promises must have an actual
[1:30:53] fulfillment
[1:30:55] the promises must actually come to pass
[1:30:58] God is God he keeps his word if he made
[1:31:00] a promise it's going to happen brother
[1:31:02] Aon that's so simple I know we've lost
[1:31:04] the Simplicity of it it's going to
[1:31:07] happen it's going to be fulfilled it's
[1:31:09] going to manifest one day I'm going to
[1:31:12] hold in my arms the Fulfillment of the
[1:31:14] promise one day I'm going to have a new
[1:31:16] body one day I'm going to Rapture one
[1:31:19] day it's going to happen and I'm looking
[1:31:20] for it
[1:31:22] today expectation
[1:31:25] not because why do they have to come to
[1:31:27] pass not because I said so because he's
[1:31:30] God and he said
[1:31:31] so therefore it must happen he's a
[1:31:35] faithful he's a true witness and his
[1:31:37] word cannot be released and forever
[1:31:39] remain in the state of
[1:31:42] promise it can't remain forever just as
[1:31:45] a
[1:31:46] promise or it's not
[1:31:48] true there has to come a fulfillment it
[1:31:52] can't forever remain in the form of
[1:31:54] spoken
[1:31:56] word it has to manifest itself but the
[1:31:59] spoken word will always culminate in the
[1:32:02] actual manifestation of what was
[1:32:05] spoken Mary said be it unto me and we
[1:32:09] celebrate that we celebrate Mary saying
[1:32:12] be it unto me but what if the child had
[1:32:14] never
[1:32:16] come what if nothing came from that be
[1:32:20] it unto me well be what unto me
[1:32:24] but what was it according to Thy word
[1:32:28] and that word was released and even
[1:32:30] though she didn't feel
[1:32:32] anything even though she didn't see a
[1:32:35] change he never leaves his word
[1:32:38] unfinished unsettled or unfulfilled and
[1:32:41] it says she didn't wait till she was
[1:32:43] positive of this she didn't wait till
[1:32:45] she felt life or some kind of a
[1:32:48] sensation to prove that she was to be a
[1:32:50] mother she just took his word and that
[1:32:53] was a enough said that's the way
[1:32:56] Miracles are performed Let me back up
[1:32:59] what happened she took the word that was
[1:33:01] enough brother Aaron I want to see a
[1:33:03] miracle I want to see amazing things
[1:33:07] that's the way Miracles are
[1:33:10] performed when God is took by his word
[1:33:14] The Impossibles Are Made
[1:33:18] Real it's impossible brother Aaron
[1:33:21] Hallelujah I got the Cure it's possible
[1:33:24] today you don't understand I got the
[1:33:25] remedy take him out his word take him
[1:33:28] out his word anchor down on that word
[1:33:30] today and watch The Impossible be made
[1:33:33] manifest in your life I can't I can't
[1:33:36] okay he can I can't do it well let me
[1:33:38] ask you this all I need you to do is by
[1:33:41] faith believe his word oh brother Aon
[1:33:44] but my Faith's so weak it's so tiny I'm
[1:33:46] glad you brought that up because you
[1:33:47] only need the faith the size of a grain
[1:33:49] of mustard seed so you are in business
[1:33:51] prepare for victory prepare for the
[1:33:54] mountain to move you are a candidate for
[1:33:55] the miraculous this
[1:33:57] [Applause]
[1:34:03] morning I just want to drive that home
[1:34:05] to you this morning God's word will
[1:34:08] always be made manifest because he is
[1:34:13] God his word is truth and in order to
[1:34:17] remain God he must always keep his
[1:34:20] word now when we reach this time that we
[1:34:24] just spoke about here with Mary we come
[1:34:26] to a place where God becomes flesh and
[1:34:30] we spoke earlier about his manifestation
[1:34:32] in the
[1:34:33] logos but now he further unfolds
[1:34:37] himself and he F unfolds himself into
[1:34:41] flesh once again vindicating that the
[1:34:43] word will always be manifested there was
[1:34:45] word promising
[1:34:47] this everything that had happened till
[1:34:49] now had pointed to this coming there had
[1:34:52] been promise after promise there had
[1:34:54] been scripture stacked upon scripture it
[1:34:56] said that the woman's seed shall bruise
[1:34:58] the Serpent's head Behold a virgin shall
[1:35:00] conceive he he will bind up the
[1:35:02] Brokenhearted he will Proclaim Liberty
[1:35:03] to the captives and there comes a day
[1:35:06] where all those scriptures that were
[1:35:08] ever spoke about him every promise every
[1:35:12] word all the Old Testament all the word
[1:35:14] is fulfilled in the man Christ
[1:35:18] Jesus or can I say manifested or can I
[1:35:21] say made visible
[1:35:24] in the man Christ Jesus and at this
[1:35:27] point at in time God has further
[1:35:29] unfolded himself from the logos into the
[1:35:32] man Christ Jesus and Hebrews 1 tells us
[1:35:36] that he was the express image of God
[1:35:41] Colossians 1:15 said he was the image of
[1:35:43] the invisible god brother Bram tells us
[1:35:46] and Jehovah God the logos who brewed
[1:35:50] over the Earth and brewed the first man
[1:35:52] Out of the Dust of the Earth
[1:35:53] overshadowed Mary and brewed over her to
[1:35:56] fulfill his word and created the blood
[1:36:00] cell that brought forth the sun of the
[1:36:02] Living God I believe in a body he was
[1:36:06] man I believe in his soul he was God and
[1:36:10] he was God's
[1:36:13] manifestation here on the earth God come
[1:36:16] in flesh Jesus Christ the
[1:36:19] logos the
[1:36:21] logos that went out in the beginning how
[1:36:24] back in the beginning no one could see
[1:36:26] God then the logos came out then God
[1:36:29] manifested himself down in man and when
[1:36:34] this happens Jesus begins a Ministry
[1:36:37] that does what it's a Ministry that
[1:36:39] makes God
[1:36:41] visible his ministry makes God visible
[1:36:45] he begins a Ministry that unveils what
[1:36:46] was hidden that manifests the Unseen the
[1:36:50] invisible God walking up in a body on
[1:36:53] the Earth just like you and I and still
[1:36:57] people couldn't see it think about that
[1:37:00] they could see it but they couldn't see
[1:37:02] him so he still wasn't visible to
[1:37:06] everyone but he's the representation the
[1:37:08] body is the representation of the Unseen
[1:37:10] God and people looked right at him and
[1:37:13] couldn't receive
[1:37:14] it we have to be willing to recognize
[1:37:22] fulfillment because we can all see the
[1:37:24] same thing and not see the same
[1:37:27] thing we have to be willing to recognize
[1:37:29] fulfilling because it doesn't uh doesn't
[1:37:32] always come the way we expect it to come
[1:37:34] sometimes the invisible becomes visible
[1:37:37] and it doesn't match what we've been
[1:37:39] taught or the visible becomes the
[1:37:42] invisible becomes visible and it isn't
[1:37:44] in our comfort
[1:37:46] zone it's not where we're real
[1:37:48] comfortable because before it was made
[1:37:51] visible we had already figured it all
[1:37:53] out in our head well God is like this
[1:37:55] and God's like that and this is how he's
[1:37:57] going to operate and this is how he's
[1:37:58] going to move and then we set up
[1:38:00] parameters and then when he becomes
[1:38:02] visible we expect him to fit inside
[1:38:04] those parameters and everything that
[1:38:06] don't fit inside those parameters we
[1:38:07] just throw away and we don't accept the
[1:38:10] Fulfillment of it because it wasn't
[1:38:11] fulfilled the way we expected it to and
[1:38:14] that's exactly what happened with the
[1:38:16] religious leaders uh in that day because
[1:38:18] in their mind it had to come a certain
[1:38:20] way it had to come to their group it had
[1:38:22] to come to the Pharisees or it had to
[1:38:24] come to the Sadducees or surely he's
[1:38:26] going to come down to caiaphus and and
[1:38:28] surely it's going to be this
[1:38:30] way it has to be exactly the way we
[1:38:33] taught it it has to be in perfect order
[1:38:35] the way we expect it and here he comes
[1:38:39] the word the logos made
[1:38:43] flesh and they look right at it and said
[1:38:46] you're of illegitimate
[1:38:48] birth look right at the Fulfillment and
[1:38:51] fail or choose not not to recognize the
[1:38:55] Fulfillment of
[1:38:56] it and because of their Traditions they
[1:38:59] couldn't see what was made visible right
[1:39:01] in front of them edting like Tabernacle
[1:39:04] let's don't let our ideas our traditions
[1:39:07] and what we think make us fail to
[1:39:09] recognize what stands right before
[1:39:12] us when something happens in a service
[1:39:14] and we can't recognize it's God moving
[1:39:17] because it's way easier to say well
[1:39:18] that's just
[1:39:20] emotion because I don't worship that
[1:39:24] way and if they do and that's God then
[1:39:27] that makes me
[1:39:29] uncomfortable or somebody does a certain
[1:39:32] thing or acts in a certain way or a
[1:39:34] certain healing is testified of when God
[1:39:36] moves and manifests who he is be willing
[1:39:39] to recognize and accept the
[1:39:41] manifestation of God because their
[1:39:44] Traditions wouldn't let them see it even
[1:39:47] though as he testified to John's
[1:39:48] disciples the blind could see the lame
[1:39:51] can walk the lepers are cleansed the
[1:39:53] deaf here the dead are raised and the
[1:39:55] gospel is preached to the poor listen it
[1:39:58] wasn't just visible
[1:40:00] flesh it wasn't just flesh walking
[1:40:03] around going I'm the Son of God I'm the
[1:40:05] Son of God can't you see me no he was
[1:40:07] manifesting God on the earth he was
[1:40:10] doing the works of the Father the
[1:40:12] invisible was becom invisible right in
[1:40:14] front of them and he said if you don't
[1:40:17] believe me look at the works look what's
[1:40:19] happening
[1:40:24] he brought God visible because the works
[1:40:26] were of God he did what only God could
[1:40:31] do and some there began to recognize but
[1:40:34] why did they recognize it's because they
[1:40:36] began to compare it to the
[1:40:38] word they began to compare it to the
[1:40:40] word he says one of them would say you
[1:40:42] know I never thought of it so much until
[1:40:44] I began to read the
[1:40:47] scriptures
[1:40:49] hello it's time we begin to read the
[1:40:51] scriptures again well I never heard of
[1:40:54] that and I never seen I it's time we
[1:40:56] begin to read the scriptures says I
[1:40:58] began to read the scriptures what
[1:40:59] Messiah was supposed to
[1:41:02] be you know there's so many people that
[1:41:05] don't know how the spirit is supposed to
[1:41:07] move in a church service because they
[1:41:08] don't read the
[1:41:12] scriptures because he was to be that
[1:41:14] prophet and then I understand that
[1:41:16] another thing when I see him break that
[1:41:18] bread and feed those people who could
[1:41:20] create but God himself so that that has
[1:41:24] to be
[1:41:25] Messiah no one can create but God God is
[1:41:29] the only Creator there is and here he
[1:41:31] took five little biscuits and two fishes
[1:41:33] and fed 5,000 taken up seven baskets
[1:41:36] full the piece is left over when nothing
[1:41:38] could do that but Jehovah the same one
[1:41:41] that red brain breed down out of the
[1:41:43] Skies that's the only one that can do it
[1:41:47] you know if people today would just take
[1:41:49] their questions back to the word
[1:41:53] right instead of to a message board or a
[1:41:56] text group chat and and spread their
[1:41:59] questions and their doubt and their
[1:42:00] unbelief if you really have an honest
[1:42:02] heart you'll find the answer right
[1:42:05] here I've always said no Christian Minds
[1:42:09] people having
[1:42:12] questions but are they honest
[1:42:14] questions because when you give someone
[1:42:17] the answer and their response is yeah I
[1:42:19] see that but they never wanted the
[1:42:21] answer
[1:42:23] their mind was made up before they ever
[1:42:26] asked you yeah I see what you're saying
[1:42:28] but what they don't want the
[1:42:31] answer their mind's made up but if
[1:42:34] they'll just take it back to the word if
[1:42:37] they'll take it back to this to settle
[1:42:38] it compare it to the word we'd have a
[1:42:40] lot more testimonies and a lot less
[1:42:44] debates he goes on and says and here he
[1:42:47] is known Among Us in a humble form of a
[1:42:50] carpenter an ordinary man here here is
[1:42:53] the Jehovah that lived in the heavens no
[1:42:55] one could see him the invisible God is
[1:42:58] made visible here Among Us for we know
[1:43:00] him he does the same works that Jehovah
[1:43:03] did Messiah was supposed to be Jehovah
[1:43:05] Emanuel God With Us and if I don't do
[1:43:08] the works of Emmanuel if I don't act
[1:43:10] like Emanuel my works is not like the
[1:43:12] Emanuel then I'm not Emanuel but if you
[1:43:15] can't believe me just watch The Works
[1:43:18] that I do they testify of who I am
[1:43:22] listen nothing's changed changed your
[1:43:24] works better still testify of who he
[1:43:29] is your Works must testify of who he is
[1:43:34] he was the very manifestation of the
[1:43:36] invisible he was the word in the body
[1:43:38] doing the works of Jehovah and he's
[1:43:40] saying if you don't believe that's who I
[1:43:42] am just look at the works I'm
[1:43:45] doing look at what's being manifested
[1:43:47] before
[1:43:49] you it says in John 14:11 believe me
[1:43:53] that I am in the father and the father
[1:43:55] in me or else believe me for the very
[1:43:57] Works sake oh you can't see me who I
[1:44:02] really am because of my
[1:44:04] birth you can't see who I really am
[1:44:06] because I didn't go to the same College
[1:44:08] you went to or get educated under the
[1:44:10] same sect of religion that you did so if
[1:44:12] you can't receive me because of those
[1:44:14] things then just look at the works that
[1:44:16] I'm doing look at how he's being
[1:44:18] manifested look at how the invisible is
[1:44:21] being made visible
[1:44:23] they testify of who I
[1:44:26] am but as blind as the religious leaders
[1:44:29] were and as blind as the majority of the
[1:44:31] people in that day were there were
[1:44:33] people who began to recognize there were
[1:44:36] people who began to see there whose eyes
[1:44:39] began to come open there were people who
[1:44:41] who began to catch glimpses and say
[1:44:44] that's right listen there's always
[1:44:47] always going to be a people who catch it
[1:44:49] when it comes there's always going to be
[1:44:51] a people that recognize the word word in
[1:44:53] their midst that recognize the works in
[1:44:55] their midst and they say that's God
[1:44:58] that's Jehovah others can cast it aside
[1:45:00] and say that's nothing but emotion
[1:45:02] that's nothing but workup we don't need
[1:45:04] this we don't need that he's just a
[1:45:06] carpenter but there's others going I see
[1:45:08] it that's God that's God that's him
[1:45:11] right there I see the invisible being
[1:45:14] made visible in our midst I see
[1:45:20] it there's always someone who catches it
[1:45:23] someone who recognizes that that that
[1:45:25] the life and the works and how do they
[1:45:28] recognize it because they have the same
[1:45:31] DNA of deity on the inside of them they
[1:45:36] recognize those family traits those
[1:45:39] family traits make sense they're an
[1:45:41] attribute of the same
[1:45:42] Source the woman of at at the well had
[1:45:45] her eyes come open how she recognized
[1:45:48] the works we know when Messiah comes he
[1:45:51] will do
[1:45:53] these things she recognized The Works

[1:46:16] something struck that's my testimony I
[1:46:19] was filthy look how filthy I was but
[1:46:21] something struck amen she seen the word
[1:46:25] of the promise from the Garden of Eden

[1:46:29] Serpent's head she seen the Messiah that
[1:46:32] had been born a virgin she heard he was
[1:46:34] to be born a virgin but they heard that
[1:46:37] man was on Earth she heard there was a
[1:46:39] young Rabbi Prophet who healed the sick
[1:46:41] she believed that and there she come
[1:46:43] down the street walking around looking
[1:46:45] around she looked over there and seen
[1:46:47] that great party going on she slipped up
[1:46:49] to the fence looked through and there he
[1:46:52] was there he was about how easy that is
[1:46:56] when you come into a service and he
[1:46:57] moves there he is she didn't say that
[1:47:00] just looks like that
[1:47:02] Carpenter Ah that's that's the son of
[1:47:04] Joseph and Mary you know what I've heard

[1:47:08] said there he is something said that's
[1:47:12] him see that's all she needed to be
[1:47:14] inspired see what happened she seen the
[1:47:17] word of God made flesh she had heard
[1:47:19] with her ear and now she saw with her
[1:47:23] eyes and what she do she fell down at
[1:47:26] his feet and she begin to worship and
[1:47:28] she began to let the oil flow a type of
[1:47:30] the Holy Ghost and she began to cry and
[1:47:32] wash his feet with her hair that's how
[1:47:34] we should all act when we seem in our
[1:47:37] midst oh I just want to fall down at
[1:47:39] your feet and worship I want to praise
[1:47:41] you you've done so much for me you've
[1:47:43] saved me you've fed me you've healed me
[1:47:45] you've been there every step of the way
[1:47:47] I just want to praise you
[1:47:53] but too many times we act like the
[1:47:57] Pharisees what gives her the
[1:47:59] right she's disturbing the
[1:48:03] service why is it always the same people
[1:48:06] that do the shouting brother Joe you
[1:48:08] know how come we don't turn that
[1:48:10] question around you tell
[1:48:13] me why is it always the same
[1:48:16] people why is it never

[1:48:24] dancing I'm sorry that's your fault not
[1:48:26] hers that's your fault not his why can't
[1:48:30] you worship a living God why can't you
[1:48:33] praise him for what he's done why can't

[1:48:37] Praises why is it always the same
[1:48:40] [Applause]
[1:48:48] ones well she's out of order
[1:48:54] could that really be
[1:48:56] him what if that isn't his Spirit making
[1:48:59] them act that way what if it's just
[1:49:01] emotion what if he's just a
[1:49:06] carpenter but the whole time you're
[1:49:08] asking your questions and criticizing
[1:49:10] somebody's washing his
[1:49:12] feet somebody ain't wasting time they're
[1:49:15] there praising their lord they're there
[1:49:17] praising their savior they're there
[1:49:18] giving them everything they don't care
[1:49:20] what you think they don't care what I
[1:49:22] think she she didn't care what anybody
[1:49:23] in there thought this was her salvation
[1:49:26] this was her ticket to a new life this
[1:49:28] was her her her her token to Eternity
[1:49:32] and she was going to give it
[1:49:35] praise while you're wondering with all
[1:49:38] your questions and all your criticisms
[1:49:40] he's being made visible and you're
[1:49:42] missing
[1:49:43] it and then you say I just want to see
[1:49:45] God no you
[1:49:48] don't you want to see a God that you've
[1:49:50] constructed in your mind that fits in
[1:49:52] your pattern and you want that God to
[1:49:54] show up you want that God to fit in your
[1:49:57] box well listen I'm going to tell you
[1:49:58] God's going to blow the walls out your
[1:50:00] box and blow the doors wide open he
[1:50:02] don't fit in your box he moves how he
[1:50:04] wants to move and he's looking for
[1:50:05] people that'll receive him when he moves
[1:50:07] the way he wants to
[1:50:09] [Applause]
[1:50:13] move recognize him when he's in our
[1:50:17] midst know your God enough to know his
[1:50:20] ways
[1:50:23] know him enough to recognize his
[1:50:27] presence commune with him enough to know
[1:50:29] his voice spend enough time with him so
[1:50:32] that when he moves and when he does the
[1:50:34] same things that he's always done when
[1:50:37] he does something that makes himself
[1:50:39] visible you can recognize
[1:50:43] him when he heals the sick that's
[1:50:47] him when he brings the power to deliver
[1:50:50] that's him when he saves a sinner that's
[1:50:52] him
[1:50:53] when he discerns the thoughts and
[1:50:54] intents of the heart and repeats your
[1:50:56] conversation right back to you from the
[1:50:58] pull pit that's
[1:51:01] him but the Pharisees says somebody told
[1:51:05] him he knew I was at church
[1:51:09] today I didn't even know I was preaching
[1:51:12] I sure didn't know you was going to be
[1:51:18] here that's
[1:51:20] him and when we see something like that
[1:51:23] happen and we see and move in a way that
[1:51:25] we recognize let it be just like it was
[1:51:27] with Copus and those walking on the road
[1:51:29] to Emmas when he did something just like
[1:51:31] he had done before he was
[1:51:33] crucified when they when when they saw
[1:51:35] him move they said that's him they
[1:51:38] recognizing they said that that's him
[1:51:40] he's here he's alive he's moving amongst
[1:51:43] us and what did it cause him to do well
[1:51:46] they got up and in order they began
[1:51:48] their walk back to Jerusalem
[1:51:52] no it lit a fire on the inside of him
[1:51:55] and they saw him moveing they said he's
[1:51:56] here he's alive brother Joe he's moving
[1:51:59] and even like Tabernacle and to their
[1:52:01] feet they went and they ran they had to
[1:52:03] tell somebody they had to Rejoice they
[1:52:06] had to let it out there was a fire lit
[1:52:08] on the inside of him recognize him in
[1:52:10] your midst recognize his manifestation
[1:52:13] and let him light a fire in your
[1:52:15] life Welcome
[1:52:18] him the Pharisees saw what they wanted
[1:52:20] to see you see what you choose to
[1:52:24] see others saw a man with a illegitimate
[1:52:26] birth but others saw
[1:52:29] God you got to lay aside your ideas this
[1:52:31] morning and see God today lay aside your
[1:52:35] preferences and see God
[1:52:37] today when he moves here I asked you an
[1:52:39] honest question when he moves here and
[1:52:41] people shout and people jump and people
[1:52:43] dance and people scream what do you
[1:52:48] see I'm going to tell you right now you
[1:52:50] see what you choose to see
[1:52:56] and then I'm going to show you what the
[1:52:57] prophet said it was using those exact
[1:53:00] same
[1:53:01] words what do you see what do you judge
[1:53:05] it
[1:53:06] as what do you call
[1:53:10] it because when that happens no matter
[1:53:13] who it is I choose to see God moving in
[1:53:16] the hearts of men and women and them
[1:53:18] responding to
[1:53:20] it that's what I see
[1:53:23] just like those on the road to Emmas
[1:53:25] they ran they shouted they told
[1:53:28] everybody listen but what do you
[1:53:30] see the prophet of God says I believe
[1:53:33] that the same God that fell on the day
[1:53:34] of Pentecost upon his church as a pillar
[1:53:37] of fire and divided himself with
[1:53:39] clothing tongues among his people is
[1:53:40] here tonight amen it's the same God he
[1:53:44] was then he is today with the same Holy
[1:53:46] Ghost I know it's a paradox it can't be
[1:53:50] explained now everybody stop
[1:53:53] quit
[1:53:56] reading because when I read this it kind
[1:53:59] of shocked me that he used this exact
[1:54:01] wording 1963 after the seals the word is
[1:54:05] open and this is what he
[1:54:07] says emotions oh he's about to blast
[1:54:10] that all that emotions screaming yeah
[1:54:13] can't have that that's out of order what
[1:54:15] good does it do anybody anyway crying
[1:54:17] and so forth so forth is a lot of
[1:54:21] stuff there's all kind if I say and so
[1:54:23] forth I mean all kind of stuff went
[1:54:27] down cannot be
[1:54:29] explained but it is a paradox how God
[1:54:31] does it it's the Unseen God wait no no
[1:54:36] that's not God you just argue with him
[1:54:39] when you get there if you get there it's
[1:54:42] the Unseen God dwelling in the human
[1:54:46] heart and what is all that emotion
[1:54:48] screaming shouting and so forth making
[1:54:51] himself
[1:54:52] visible by vindicating his word that he
[1:54:56] is the same yesterday today and
[1:55:00] forever don't you worry about what
[1:55:02] anybody thinks your worship makes God
[1:55:05] visible your worship manifested
[1:55:08] invisible God you can shout you can
[1:55:10] scream you can do whatever you want to
[1:55:13] do in the worship of an invisible God
[1:55:16] and it makes my God visible it manifests
[1:55:20] him
[1:55:25] that's just emotion yep and it manifests
[1:55:28] my
[1:55:32] God I say God make me more emotional so
[1:55:35] I can manifest you
[1:55:37] better make me more free so I can
[1:55:40] manifest your your body better here upon
[1:55:42] the Earth Let My Worship make you
[1:55:45] visible to others whether they choose to
[1:55:47] see it or
[1:55:50] not don't let anybody any anybody make
[1:55:52] you afraid to
[1:55:55] worship it don't matter if they see it
[1:55:57] as just a workup it don't matter if they
[1:55:59] see it as just emotionalism it makes God
[1:56:05] visible
[1:56:06] Jesus let me see what time it is oh
[1:56:09] we're
[1:56:10] good thank
[1:56:12] you Jesus was the word made
[1:56:16] flesh we know that and his ministry in
[1:56:19] that body made the invisible God
[1:56:25] visible the fullness of a godhead in a
[1:56:28] body but there came a time after he
[1:56:30] finished everything that he was supposed
[1:56:32] to
[1:56:34] fulfill in the body of the groom that
[1:56:37] he's taken up and that he leaves return
[1:56:41] to what we would call
[1:56:44] invisible but he
[1:56:46] promised that there are certain people
[1:56:48] that would still be able to see him
[1:56:49] brother
[1:56:50] John he wasn't going to be be invisible
[1:56:53] to
[1:56:54] everybody he's still going to be visible
[1:56:57] he tells us in John 14 and I will pray
[1:56:59] the father and he shall give you another
[1:57:00] comforter that he may abide with you
[1:57:03] forever even the spirit of Truth whom
[1:57:06] the world cannot receive because it
[1:57:08] seeth him not he's invisible to them it
[1:57:13] seeth him not neither knoweth him but
[1:57:15] you know me for he dwelleth in you and
[1:57:17] shall be and shall be in you I will not
[1:57:20] leave you comfortless I will come to you
[1:57:22] you yet a little while in the world
[1:57:25] seeth me no more he's
[1:57:27] invisible but
[1:57:30] yet you see
[1:57:32] me because I live you shall live also at
[1:57:36] that day you shall know that I am the
[1:57:38] father and and ye and me and I and ye
[1:57:40] and you he that hath my Commandments and
[1:57:43] keepeth them he it is that loveth me and
[1:57:46] he that loveth me shall be loved of my
[1:57:48] father and I will love him and
[1:57:50] will manifest
[1:57:54] myself to him I'm GNA make myself known
[1:57:57] I'm G make myself visible you shall see
[1:58:01] me he's not invisible to us this morning
[1:58:04] amen he's not invisible to you and me
[1:58:06] although he's still the invisible God
[1:58:09] he's still the invisible God yet we see
[1:58:11] him we see him through the
[1:58:13] manifestations of his promises in the
[1:58:16] Fulfillment of his word and the
[1:58:17] unveiling of his word and now we can say
[1:58:21] that the word being made flesh isn't
[1:58:24] just a 2,000 year ago thing brother
[1:58:27] Joe we're bringing this down now how is
[1:58:30] the Unseen going to be manifested in
[1:58:32] this
[1:58:33] day because word made flesh isn't just
[1:58:36] something from 2,000 years ago but in
[1:58:38] our day the invisible God has been made
[1:58:42] visible once again in this day in our
[1:58:45] day in our age the logos that Pillar of
[1:58:48] Fire the same logos that met Moses in
[1:58:51] the burning Bush the same logos that met
[1:58:55] Paul on the road that same logos came
[1:58:58] down and met a prophet in this day in
[1:59:00] Houston
[1:59:01] Texas that same Pillar of Fire is made
[1:59:03] visible not just to one person but to
[1:59:05] thousands in attendance and the millions
[1:59:07] who have seen that picture around the
[1:59:09] world brother Aaron I want to see the
[1:59:10] pillar of fire okay walk back there look
[1:59:13] on that wall and he made sure that we
[1:59:15] could always and forever see the pillar
[1:59:18] of Fire
[1:59:22] he became visible in this day and he
[1:59:25] began to further unfold
[1:59:28] himself he unfolded from the logos into
[1:59:32] Jesus and now once again he's unfolding
[1:59:36] in this day and he begins to
[1:59:38] unfold because see there had been a
[1:59:40] groom that made him
[1:59:42] manifest there had been a groom that
[1:59:45] manifested to those that could receive
[1:59:46] it and then after 2,000 years he comes
[1:59:49] again in the fullness of his word
[1:59:51] through the through the promised message
[1:59:53] of Malachi 4 which unveils him once
[1:59:56] again to the elect or to the
[2:00:00] bride he says they believe but they
[2:00:03] never broke into this yet I'm glad I've
[2:00:06] broke into
[2:00:08] this to see that great shika light both
[2:00:11] spiritual and physical both spiritual
[2:00:14] and
[2:00:15] physical in so much that a mechanical
[2:00:18] eye of the camera keeps taking the
[2:00:20] picture just two weeks ago caught it
[2:00:22] again you're revealing yourself Lord the
[2:00:24] Mighty God unveiled to the believer
[2:00:29] still veiled the world shall not see me
[2:00:32] still veiled to the unbeliever but
[2:00:35] unveiled to the believer you're a
[2:00:38] Believer this morning you have the
[2:00:39] opportunity to see him you have the
[2:00:41] opportunity to look upon him what was it
[2:00:45] what was this message that came it was
[2:00:46] the word coming of Christ it was the
[2:00:50] word coming of Christ and it was for the
[2:00:52] purpose that the elect might see him
[2:00:54] once again that that that all that had
[2:00:57] been hidden would now be revealed and
[2:00:58] that and that all that had been
[2:01:00] invisible would now be visible it would
[2:01:02] now be
[2:01:03] seen and once again many couldn't
[2:01:06] receive it many couldn't see it even
[2:01:09] though they testified that the works
[2:01:11] were of God you ever thought about all
[2:01:14] those books that we know those titles
[2:01:16] you know a man sent from God and a
[2:01:18] prophet visit South Africa and all all
[2:01:19] the books that we know of from back in
[2:01:22] that time period and they would have
[2:01:24] headlines and say things like Bible days
[2:01:26] are here
[2:01:28] again do you realize that message
[2:01:32] churches didn't
[2:01:35] exist brother brandham didn't preach the
[2:01:37] message churches he preached to
[2:01:39] denominational
[2:01:41] people mostly in Pentecostal circles but
[2:01:43] denominational people so what's my point
[2:01:47] this wasn't message
[2:01:50] propaganda this wasn't us saying these
[2:01:54] things this was
[2:01:56] them the ones that say well he got off
[2:01:59] he was this oh cult oh this oh false
[2:02:02] prophet well your discernment was uh on
[2:02:05] pretty good for a little while because
[2:02:07] they were the ones saying it's a manent
[2:02:09] from God Bible days are here again
[2:02:11] nothing like this has happened since
[2:02:13] Jesus walked on the shores of Galilee
[2:02:15] that wasn't us saying that that was them
[2:02:17] saying that they testified that the
[2:02:20] works were of God
[2:02:22] think about it brother brandom could
[2:02:24] have said you don't think I I'm a
[2:02:26] messenger for God okay but believe me
[2:02:28] for the work's
[2:02:30] sake they testified that the works were
[2:02:34] from
[2:02:37] God but those who had
[2:02:40] Isa those who had the ability to see
[2:02:43] those that were that were out of the
[2:02:45] that that came forth out of the same
[2:02:46] logos word
[2:02:48] DNA from before the foundation of the
[2:02:51] world this message made God visible to
[2:02:54] them it made him plain it it brought the
[2:02:58] Unseen World into Plain View and it
[2:03:00] didn't come in word only that's it
[2:03:03] didn't come in word only it came in
[2:03:05] power it came in
[2:03:08] demonstration the gospel was put before
[2:03:11] the people and shown that this gospel
[2:03:13] has power yes we need to make sure we
[2:03:15] get the mechanics lined up right yes we
[2:03:17] need the doctrines lined up right yes
[2:03:20] those things are important but with
[2:03:21] without the Dynamics it's no good and
[2:03:24] brother brandham knew that and brother
[2:03:26] brandham taught that and he stood there
[2:03:27] and he corrected Doctrine and then he
[2:03:29] demonstrated the Dynamics that would
[2:03:31] come with a word properly
[2:03:37] placed it didn't come in word only but
[2:03:39] our eye our ears have heard but we can
[2:03:43] also say brother Joe that our eyes have
[2:03:46] seen he says did did he do it just
[2:03:49] exactly the way he said he would do it
[2:03:52] now how many believes he's the same
[2:03:53] yesterday today and forever sensing his
[2:03:55] presence now you've seen his
[2:03:59] presence now you've seen his presence
[2:04:02] now your eye has seen your ears have
[2:04:05] understood and God has confirmed before
[2:04:08] your eyes his presence and that what you
[2:04:12] feel all the time that condemns you when
[2:04:15] you're wrong and tells you not to do
[2:04:18] that that same God has become visible
[2:04:21] ible to you here this afternoon where
[2:04:25] where is he visible well brother Aaron
[2:04:27] he's visible in just in it's in his
[2:04:31] word well in
[2:04:32] 1965 brother Bram makes clear that the
[2:04:35] reason he's become
[2:04:37] visible and how he's become visible is
[2:04:40] where in his Works believe if you can't
[2:04:45] accept what I'm telling you you should
[2:04:47] at least believe it for the work's
[2:04:50] sake in his
[2:04:52] works and yet that wasn't the end of his
[2:04:54] unfolding that word coming as mighty and
[2:04:56] as wonderful it was that wasn't the
[2:04:58] purpose the purpose of the word coming
[2:05:00] wasn't just for the word coming kind of
[2:05:02] like we say this the purpose of God sent
[2:05:04] a prophet wasn't just so God could send
[2:05:05] a
[2:05:06] prophet there was a purpose for the word
[2:05:09] coming there was a further unfolding
[2:05:11] that had to take place the word coming
[2:05:14] was to produce the bride
[2:05:17] coming a further unfolding and the bride
[2:05:20] coming that the word coming came to
[2:05:22] produce the bride coming to produce a
[2:05:24] bride for Christ a match piece for him
[2:05:27] something that matched him perfectly
[2:05:30] well I'm getting ahead of myself here
[2:05:31] but if he In the Flesh manifested the
[2:05:35] invisible God in his day and the bride
[2:05:39] matches him perfectly bone of his bone
[2:05:41] flesh of his flesh power of his power
[2:05:43] then what are we here to do we are here
[2:05:46] to make the Unseen manifested we're here
[2:05:50] to make the invisible become inv visible
[2:05:52] we're here to do the works of Jesus
[2:05:54] Christ we're not just here to say I
[2:05:56] believe a message I'm following a
[2:05:58] prophet but we're here to manifest
[2:06:00] Christ to a d World manifest his Works
[2:06:04] to a d world and say there is a living
[2:06:07] God look you can see him in his works
[2:06:10] the same works that I do shall you do
[2:06:14] also why to make the invisible God
[2:06:17] visible here amongst us
[2:06:20] hallelujah a match
[2:06:23] piece because it's God's desire to be
[2:06:31] manifested that his life be visible he
[2:06:34] doesn't want to remain where nobody can
[2:06:39] see he wants his life
[2:06:41] manifested he wants his life
[2:06:50] portrayed that's a that's the desire of
[2:06:52] his heart even from the beginning when
[2:06:54] there was nothing if we go back to that
[2:06:55] he wanted all those
[2:06:57] attributes he wanted them displayed he
[2:07:00] he wanted them manifested that his life
[2:07:02] would become visible and it was
[2:07:04] manifested in different ways down
[2:07:06] through the Old
[2:07:07] Testament all culminating in the groom
[2:07:11] Jesus Christ and when he came forth it
[2:07:14] it manifested God in a body but here we
[2:07:17] are like I said 2,000 years later and
[2:07:19] God once again is in a
[2:07:23] body God once
[2:07:25] again is in a body and it's made up of
[2:07:29] all the
[2:07:30] attributes that he had in him before the
[2:07:32] foundation of the world all those
[2:07:36] attributes which were
[2:07:37] invisible think about it you were
[2:07:39] invisible but just like all of God's
[2:07:42] word they came to manifestation in due
[2:07:45] time what are you telling me brother
[2:07:47] Aaron I'm telling you you're right on
[2:07:49] time you're right where you're supposed
[2:07:51] to be doing exactly what you're supposed
[2:07:53] to do he said I choose you to go into
[2:07:56] Satan's Eden and manifest my life in the
[2:07:59] worst day in the darkest day I want you
[2:08:01] to shine a light that says there's a
[2:08:03] living God when they say there's no
[2:08:05] healer I want you to manifest the Healer
[2:08:07] when they say there's no Deliverance I
[2:08:09] want you to manifest the Deliverance
[2:08:11] when they say I don't move that way
[2:08:13] anymore I want your worship to make me
[2:08:15] visible and see that the Holy Spirit
[2:08:18] still operates the way it always
[2:08:20] operated said you're right on time now
[2:08:24] do what you were called to do and
[2:08:26] manifest the invisible
[2:08:29] God
[2:08:32] hallelujah your job is to make God
[2:08:35] visible manifesting the Unseen God he
[2:08:39] says then what does that you being a
[2:08:42] part of God's Gene a part of the word
[2:08:45] other men a part of God's word seated
[2:08:47] together manifested the entire body of
[2:08:50] Christ because there's no leaven among
[2:08:53] you amen no leaven among you just the
[2:08:56] word only seated in Heavenly places in
[2:08:58] the door where he put his name Christ
[2:09:01] Jesus no leaven among you that brings
[2:09:05] come on now that brings the entire
[2:09:07] fullness of the godhead bodily among you
[2:09:11] couldn't do it in Luther's age couldn't
[2:09:13] do it in Wesley's age couldn't do it in
[2:09:15] the Pentecost AG if you'll look closely
[2:09:17] while we're reading this this is
[2:09:18] adoption but in the day when the son of
[2:09:20] man will be manifested revealed brought
[2:09:23] back to the church together with the
[2:09:25] entire deity of God amongst his people
[2:09:29] showing the same visible signs
[2:09:31] manifesting himself like he did at the
[2:09:33] beginning when he manifested on the
[2:09:34] earth in the form of prophet God Oh
[2:09:36] Glory promised by Malachi 4 promised by
[2:09:40] the rest of the scriptures who are we we
[2:09:44] are Christ

[2:09:48] are the works of Christ being done in
[2:09:50] you and you and you and you and you and
[2:09:53] you and you and you and you and
[2:09:55] you the full godhead the full deity
[2:09:58] everything couldn't be done in Luther
[2:10:00] couldn't be done in Wesley but he
[2:10:02] unfolded it in this day to make himself
[2:10:05] visible amongst
[2:10:07] you you Tabernacle the
[2:10:13] logos you manifesting Jesus you making
[2:10:18] the invisible God visible it he shows

[2:10:47] manifestation Satan is being manifested
[2:10:50] on every hand
[2:10:52] that tree is coming to maturity it's
[2:10:55] bearing its fruit his works his lies his
[2:10:59] anointing until there's a people on
[2:11:01] Earth who are physical
[2:11:04] representations of
[2:11:07] hell but there's another
[2:11:10] group I'll call him the bone of his bone
[2:11:12] group The Flesh of his flesh group The
[2:11:15] Power of his power group The be it unto
[2:11:17] me group and they have gisen to a point
[2:11:20] to where they're manif in his works his
[2:11:22] truth his anointing his healing they're
[2:11:25] manifesting Jesus Christ here upon the
[2:11:27] Earth hell is being manifested and
[2:11:29] Heaven's being manifested and let me go
[2:11:31] ahead and tell you which one wins Heaven
[2:11:34] is more powerful than hell our groove
[2:11:36] conquered death hell and the grave we're
[2:11:39] the winners our manifestation Will
[2:11:41] Conquer that manifestation hell is being
[2:11:44] manifested Heaven's being manifested a
[2:11:46] Rapture is going to be manifested Jesus
[2:11:49] Christ walking on Earth in body again
[2:11:52] doing what he's always
[2:11:54] done
[2:11:55] [Music]
[2:11:57] hallelujah
[2:12:02] hallelujah doing the same things he did
[2:12:05] because he is manifested in
[2:12:10] her he says then at the end of the
[2:12:12] messages see the action of the great
[2:12:14] Holy Spirit see him come down visible
[2:12:17] before people even taking pictures of it
[2:12:20] see it working and showing that it's not
[2:12:21] a man it's not a preacher it's not a
[2:12:24] certain congregation it's the Holy
[2:12:26] Spirit showing the same thing it did
[2:12:28] when it was embodied in the body of
[2:12:30] Jesus Christ now it's embodied in the
[2:12:35] body of his bride it should throw us
[2:12:39] into
[2:12:41] desperation and what kind of people
[2:12:43] ought we to be what type of ministry
[2:12:44] ought we we're to be his match piece
[2:12:46] we're to be living like he lived
[2:12:48] overcoming like he overcame Conquering
[2:12:50] the way he conquered doing exactly what
[2:12:52] it is he did it should throw us into a
[2:12:55] desperation what type of life should I
[2:12:57] be
[2:12:58] living because the promises of God
[2:13:00] cannot and will not remain invisible
[2:13:03] scripture cannot remain invisible it
[2:13:05] must come to pass it must be fulfilled
[2:13:08] the scriptures about Jesus eventually
[2:13:10] had to have skin on them John 14:12
[2:13:14] eventually got to have skin on it Mark
[2:13:16] 16's eventually got to have skin on it
[2:13:19] the scriptures about a church without
[2:13:20] spotter wrinkle eventually has to have
[2:13:23] skin on it and I believe I'm looking at
[2:13:25] people with skin on them that manifest
[2:13:27] that scripture in this day am man all
[2:13:30] the word coming with skin on it again
[2:13:34] manifesting the truth bearing the same
[2:13:36] fruits that he
[2:13:38] bore he said if I do not the works of my
[2:13:41] father so what are we supposed to look
[2:13:43] at the
[2:13:44] fruits look at the
[2:13:47] life I'm
[2:13:49] obviously no farmer or any such thing
[2:13:53] but I'll give a simple illustration the
[2:13:54] way brother brandham would if you if you
[2:13:56] take a look at an orange
[2:13:59] tree that tree isn't the
[2:14:03] life it's just a visible manifestation
[2:14:06] of the
[2:14:08] life just like my body is the visible
[2:14:10] manifestation of my soul of who I am
[2:14:13] it's a visible manifestation of the life
[2:14:16] and when it puts forth a branch you can
[2:14:18] see the life of that vine in the fruit
[2:14:23] of the branch the orange that grows on
[2:14:26] that orange tree tells me there's life
[2:14:30] there and I see a manifestation or a
[2:14:33] representation of that life I can see it
[2:14:36] with my eyes the orange lets me know
[2:14:38] that the Unseen life of the vine is
[2:14:41] there there's life in that
[2:14:44] tree there's life and I want to say that
[2:14:48] there's life in the bride because what
[2:14:51] are we connected to we're connected
[2:14:53] we're connected to the vine we're the
[2:14:56] branches but I see the fruit I see
[2:14:58] changed lives I see Life there to
[2:15:00] overcome I see Life there to change I
[2:15:03] see Life to bring Victory I see Life to
[2:15:06] overcome I see Life to Rapture your life
[2:15:09] the fruit that you Bear shows me that
[2:15:11] the life is
[2:15:12] there because the life is shown forth in
[2:15:15] the fruits him living the same life
[2:15:17] through her fulfilling his word through
[2:15:21] her he said Jesus did the works of his
[2:15:23] father because the father was in him
[2:15:26] that is why the works was done because
[2:15:27] the father was in the son do you believe
[2:15:30] that that in him he was the Incarnate
[2:15:33] God do you believe that that God the
[2:15:35] Father which is the father of Jesus
[2:15:37] Christ the great spirit dwelt in the
[2:15:40] fullness of his power in Jesus Christ
[2:15:43] which was the Tabernacle of God made
[2:15:45] flesh and dwelt on the earth
[2:15:46] representing going back to the logos the
[2:15:49] word representing the word word Jesus
[2:15:52] was the word the Bible said so St John 1
[2:15:55] Chapter and the Word was invisible now
[2:15:58] listen close the word was invisible
[2:16:01] until it was made flesh and when the
[2:16:03] word become visible and through his
[2:16:06] sacrificial death at Calvary and his
[2:16:09] resurrection positionally placed his
[2:16:11] church in that realm that the same
[2:16:15] invisible God could come into the
[2:16:17] individual that's right could come into
[2:16:20] the individual idual and make the
[2:16:23] word
[2:16:25] visible oh my I wish my church could get
[2:16:30] that we're going to read it again
[2:16:32] because if brother brandham thought it
[2:16:33] was that important through his
[2:16:35] sacrificial death at Calvary and his
[2:16:37] resurrection positionally plac his
[2:16:39] church in that realm that the same
[2:16:41] invisible God could come into the
[2:16:43] individual and make the word visible oh
[2:16:47] my I wish my church could get that if
[2:16:49] you could see friends the invisible God
[2:16:52] made visible hallelujah what are we
[2:16:56] doing here brother Aaron do you see God
[2:16:58] I see him all around me this morning I
[2:17:00] see God manifested in flesh I see
[2:17:03] Overcomers just like Jesus I see people
[2:17:05] walking through Satan's eaten stomping
[2:17:07] on this devil stomping on that devil
[2:17:09] Victory here Victory there overcoming
[2:17:12] each and every day I see Jesus I see God
[2:17:18] made manifest here amongst us
[2:17:22] Hallelujah he say gracious God who
[2:17:24] brought again the lord Jesus thy son
[2:17:26] from the dead and has presented him to
[2:17:28] us after 2,000 years we see him day
[2:17:32] after day and night after night in The
[2:17:35] Invisible body of his working in the
[2:17:38] visible body of his church what is this
[2:17:42] body it's a restored body this body of
[2:17:46] this church it's a restored body a true
[2:17:50] representation ation of Jesus Christ
[2:17:52] upon the earth a body that has come as
[2:17:55] it were a toddler or or or baby toddler
[2:17:59] under
[2:18:01] Luther and then there was growth as it
[2:18:03] went into Wesley
[2:18:06] childhood there was growth but it didn't
[2:18:08] reach maturity then Aza came there was
[2:18:11] growth there was a greater portion
[2:18:13] unfolded but it was still only an
[2:18:15] adolescent
[2:18:17] body it had not come to maturity but
[2:18:20] then the fullness came the full maturity
[2:18:24] and the shook separates from the seed
[2:18:29] and he says adoption time when God can
[2:18:32] pour out his fullness his power his
[2:18:36] resurrection that when the church and
[2:18:38] Christ become so close together till
[2:18:40] Christ becomes visible Among Us and
[2:18:42] raises the dead and we go into a
[2:18:47] Rapture think about it there wasn't one
[2:18:50] thing that Jesus didn't fulfill that was
[2:18:52] said about him there isn't one promise
[2:18:55] given to you or about you that you're
[2:18:58] not going to
[2:18:59] fulfill can you believe that can you
[2:19:02] accept that this morning can you begin
[2:19:04] to recognize who you are and what you're
[2:19:06] called for just bear with me for about
[2:19:09] five minutes as we're going to bring
[2:19:10] this down to a close because the
[2:19:14] invisible the Unseen is becoming
[2:19:17] manifest in our day and you're a part of
[2:19:20] that
[2:19:22] prophet of God says well how can the
[2:19:23] Bride come and fail to manifest

[2:19:40] manifest everything that was promised of
[2:19:42] him and the groom come and he wouldn't
[2:19:44] be the bride but when he did everything
[2:19:46] even to proving it by raising himself up
[2:19:49] from the dead afterwards then don't the
[2:19:52] bride have to do the same thing have to
[2:19:54] be exactly what the word said she would
[2:19:56] be in these last days don't she have to
[2:19:59] return through Malachi 4 don't she have
[2:20:02] to be manifested like it was in the days
[2:20:04] of Sodom don't the world have to be just
[2:20:06] exactly like it is isn't these things a
[2:20:09] perfect identification of the word of
[2:20:12] God made known unto us the invisible God
