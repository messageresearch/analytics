yourself among us tonight Lord help us to move out of way I pray in jesus' name amen amen let's turn to Matthew chapter 14 amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen says when the the disciple verse 26 said when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid and Peter answered him and said Lo Lord if thou if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to to Jesus but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and begin to sink he cried saying Lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him said unto him oh thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt and when they were come to the ship the wind ceased then they that were in the ship came and worshiped him saying oh a truth Thou Art the Son of God Amen we let you be seated tonight i' like to speak to you tonight on faith to let go amen Faith to let go you know as I thought about this event that took place is quite an amazing quite an amazing deal for a man to walk on water I I don't know if any of y'all know that but that's not really possible as far as humanly speaking and uh but you know here here they're out in the middle of this o this sea and they're they're being tossed about as we spoke about last Wednesday day and they see what they think is a Spirit come walking on the water because they didn't think any man could do this but this was more than a man this was God veiled in flesh and we can read the script he uses the seed he walks upon the sea and and those things that's in the Psalms and reading over them today amen that there's nothing impossible with God God's ruler over every element whether it be the ground or the sea or or or the air it does not matter he rules over that but could you imagine as they're watching this take place and they they begin to become fearful and they hear a voice and maybe they recognized this voice because they had heard it before and it said be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid and and you know and Peter he he just puts himself out there as it were he said Lord if it be thou bid me come and you know he didn't say it is me or yeah I'm I've been with you I've done this and done gave him proof or anything and he didn't give him details he just says one word come and that's not a lot to rest on but one word of God is a lot to rest on Amen When God Says something you can believe it amen and it's going to work amen to walk on water you know maybe he started having by mind battles though as he begin to take that first move and to put his foot over that that that bow of the boat you know that's a that's a big deal when you do that to step from something that you feel comfort in you know he was a seaman he he was a fisherman he he knew how to handle ores but you know there was in this moment but yet still yet in this moment there was comfort in this boat cuz this boat was built to float it was not built to go down it was it was built to go across waves it was built to do this so there was something inside of them that still had Comfort being in that place because I don't read in the scripture where any of them had jumped out I don't read in the scripture where any of them had left the boat but they were still there even though the waves were very bad and it seemed like all hope was gone but here here in his mind as he begins to put his first foot out you know he didn't get God Jesus didn't give him details he didn't tell him how it was going to happen or how he could do it he just said come and but as long as he had a hand on the ship maybe he felt just to still a little bit safer but God has a way of getting us to places where we don't have anything to hold on but him amen letting go is just simply letting God Amen letting go is getting out of the way so that God can work his work in you amen it's not a weakness to let go but it's actually a strength and to let go letting go is to experience a power beyond ourselves amen because this was not Peter's power he didn't have the power to do this but it was letting go to experience something that he could not do himself Letting Go means you are not in control any longer a lot of times that's hard as human beings because we like to be in control we we like to you know have an element of control we like to control certain situations if we can but God loves to get us in places where we lose control amen you know there's some people that you call them overthinkers or or they think about things too much because they like control they like to have certain things a certain way and for it to be a certain thing but God many times comes against our humanism if I can say it that way and he takes us and puts us in a place where no matter what we do or how we do it we're going to fail if we depend upon our own our own senses our own abilities amen God got Peter out into a place amen where he couldn't grab a hold of anything he couldn't do anything on his own the only thing he could do is look to him amen and that is what God wants in our lives see he wants us to let loose and let God brother Bram said I used to preach this sermon quite a bit let loose and let God God just let loose and let God but as long as you got yourself into it you're in the way amen you know the he said the biggest enemy I got is William brandom he's always in God's way if I can just get him out of the way then God can go to work that's your worst enemy is yourself just get yourself out of the way let go he said I've often said the greatest enemy I got is William brandom he's the one that gets in God's way he's the the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometimes he thinks he can do something about it but when he does that shoves God right out of the picture amen right out of the picture but when I get rid of that guy when I get to a place that he is out of the way then God can come over and do things that William brandom knows nothing about Hallelujah that's the way it is with a minister of any sort of any kind whether you whether whether it's the prophet or a pastor or evangelist amen it's getting ourself out of the way do you know how hard it is Amen to get up in front of people and just let go Amen Let Go of what you think or let go of your what you way way you normally act or let go of who you think you really are and just get yourself out of the way and let God take over amen that's what we want in every service amen but it ain't just the preacher that needs to do that we need to do that out there in the audience as well get to a place that we get our worst enemy out of the way amen our worst enemy is not the one sitting next to you or the one standing before you or the one sitting behind you or somewhere in the building or somewhere out on the street what you need to do is take a mirror and look inside of it that's your worst enemy that's what stops you many times from getting blessings from God that's what stops you from receiving something from God is that enemy that flesh that wants to hold on to that boat he wants to hold on to that safety net and not step out and walk to Jesus but we want to get to Jesus he said when when William brandom can get out of the way that's when God can use him the best he said that's when God can use you that's when he can use any of you he can use anybody when we get ourselves out of the way but as long as we got ourselves in the way then he can't amen as long as you go to doing that so you know somebody talks about you you know well I'm just I tell you what I'm going to say God can't fight your battle you're fighting it yourself amen you're fighting yourself he said just let loose and let him do it just commit it to him the greatest weapon I know in a Christian today is committing to God committed to God you when you can't do nothing about it just commit it to God and God will take care of it but you know it's our natural uh human uh want to a reaction to be want to be in control we want to control but you know how much control do you actually have think about it how much control do you actually have you did not choose when to be born anybody in here choose what day you wanted to be born no no you did not choose what gender you was going to be neither can you choose that now amen you don't you didn't choose how you would look well I want I wouldn't want to be 6'4 and this and God chose you amen God is in control of your life you did not choose how you were going to look you didn't choose what household you would be born in you didn't choose what parents you would have come on somebody you did not choose your DNA you didn't even get to choose what country you would be born in or the culture you would be born in you did not get to choose the day the month or the year you was going to be born in you did not choose whether you would be healthy or not or your strength is or your strengths or choose your weaknesses you didn't get to choose none of that you didn't even get to choose your personality you didn't even get to choose your temperament in reality we had nothing to say in who what where or when of the beginning of our resistance was but we want to be in control well I you know I would but I that's just not me no we're still in control that's that's that's you putting on the brakes amen that's you grabbing back a hold of the boat and trying to get one in and one leg in and one leg out God wants you all the way amen it's easy to you know to say well I I I I I I just want to give God everything and we still got one leg in the boat and one leg Out on the Ocean testing the waters come on somebody we we want to test the service and see how it's going to be we want to test the sermon and how it's going to be no God wants you all in he wants you you're not we are not as human beings we are not really in control of anything Amen in reality we had nothing to say who we were what we were I'm sorry to put this on you but if God would have chose he could have made you a giraffe or whatever but he chose you to be born in a certain family with certain characteristics about you to look a certain way I I get amazed I really get amazed at the greatness of God you want to think about the greatness of God think about how many ways of face a human face can be made they ain't a person in this little bit of what 150 200 people whatever is here tonight that looks the same you might even be brothers and sisters but you still don't look the same now I know there's identical twins I understand all of that amen but what what I'm talking about is God is is in control of what you are who you are where you are sure I'm not trying to say you don't have choices I understand all that but God is ultimately ly in control of your life you did not choose God God chose you do you know the percentages that it would take for you to be born you young people to be born in a message beli in home you could have been born out there in the world and and and you may have found your way one day as many others found their way Amen to the truth and not even born but you got the you got the chance to be born in a believer's home to be be raised up in a believer's atmosphere am man what a blessing that really is we shouldn't cha at that and get upset oh I wish I was this i w no God made you who you are what you are and where you are so there is only one who chose that for us that's God he chose what day you was was going to be born what month you was going to be born year you was going to be born he chose where you was going to be born he watched your lineage all the way down through making sure you was going to come exactly at the right time Hallelujah you are not here by accident come on somebody quit letting the devil tell you you're an accident you are not here by accident you're here by the plan of almighty God God put you here and he placed you here and he put something inside of you to want to go to him do you understand how many people the percentage of this world that don't even want to go to him if they saw him they wouldn't even speak to him they don't even want to acknowledge Him but God put something on the inside of you to want to go to where he was where he is many times when in our greatest struggle we're trying to stay afloat we're trying to stay above the problems he's just wanting you to let he's just wanting you to let go Letting Go means turning those fears over to God and learning to trust him more Letting Go does not mean that fears do not exist in your life but it means that your trust in God is greater and stronger than any fear he said well let loose let go how do I do it just let go that's all you have to do take God God's word well he only said come well that's enough do you realize you can walk on water with one word with one word from his lips it made a man walk on water one word made a man walk on water and defy nature and defy gravity one word how much more will the words of almighty God do for you amen it'll do more than just walk on the water it'll make you walk over your trials it'll make you walk over the head of every devil it'll make you walk over your situation it'll make you rise above it all we ain't got just one word we got every word so just let go that's all you have to do take God's word we ain't trying to work up nothing it ain't get down the Altar and beat and holler Lord give me this give me that give me the Holy Ghost just beating the altar ain't going to make him come amen don't do no good that ain't the way he comes it's taking him at his word Peter looked like he was going to die but he seen the Lord walking and he said Lord if it be you bid me come the Lord said come what now what what Peter said now wait a minute Lord let me go on a 40-day fast let me go out there and test and see if I can walk on the water or not yeah Peter wouldn't like that fell that got challenged to eat a 5 pound watermelon he said let me go home first he went home and he came back and said okay I'm ready and he ate the watermelon he got I said wow that's amazing here's your $5 or $10 said what what' you need to go home first he said well I had one of them at home and I want to make sure I could eat it first that ain't Peter he's God said come and he just went all right come and he just stepped out well let me see if I can walk on it first or not let me see if I can over if I can really do this or not see we're wanting control let me see let me look look at it and see if I can do this or not that wasn't Peter Peter said okay you said come I'm going to take you at your word and he steps out the boat well let me just get up worked up enough where I can dance in the spirit and speak in tongues in this boat then I'll step out no he took God at his word he let loose and let go and God took him through amen he said see that's exactly what happened to the woman that was out there picking up a few sticks and it was a big de dry desert and it was a a famine in the land there hadn't been no rain a drought that was going and she's picking up the last few sticks to make a last meal for her and her her son and she hears a voice and it says make me one first she had to let go of a lot of things right then cuz she knew that she only had she only had enough meal and enough oil for one cake and she was going to eat make that and her and her son was going to eat it and die and she hears a voice make me one first first and she let go of her natural instinct to survive her natural instinct to provide for her son and and and and to allow him to maybe he's going but she knew that this was not just any voice she recognized who that was that was the prophet of Israel and she knew that he had was something behind that voice and she went in there and she made for one first she said what was it see there seek ye first the kingdom of God in his righteousness not the kingdom of God in a little noise not the kingdom of God in a little motion not the kingdom of God this and that but God and his righteousness and everything else will be added to you the Widow heard faith comes by hearing and hearing the word she said that's the word of the Lord that's the prophet of Israel I know it's the truth that's the word of God she didn't run to her neighbor and ask what do you think the preacher said this but what do you think honestly God's not even concerned about what you think or anybody else thinks we are only the ones that are concerned about what everybody else thinks she wanted to get in to get it all out she let go she let go of what she had that she might get more come on somebody she let go of what she had that she might get more that's what the world needs today is a good oldfashioned letting go of what you got amen she dumped out so she could get filled up she dumped out all the oil she had she dumped out all the meal she had and when she dumped it all in there God came down and he filled it back up again Hallelujah every time she dumped it out he filled it up every time she what does he say every time she let go God gave her more more listen God wants to give you more than yesterday's experience he wants to give you more than last camp meeting or our next camp meeting he wants to give you an everyday upto-date experience but it takes letting go so you can get more God's not a unjust judge or or some some evil father that you know you you ask for bread and he's going to give you a stone that's not God if God is asking you to let go that means he's got something better in store amen if God's asking you to release some things he's got something better for you well you know well I got I got I got this issue brother Timothy I got this a in my heart and I got I got this bitterness and I can't forgive over do you understand that that's just a bunch of cheap junk it has no Eternal value when it comes to a Christian anything that has Eternal value is true riches anything that does not have eternal value is cheap junk but how many times we will keep all this cheap junk when God's wanting to give us true riches God's wanting to give us more than what we could ever think or ask for he said ask and it shall be given to you abundantly but we hauling around all this cheap junk well can't even meet with your family because you got some all in your heart that's cheap junk is what it is L let me ask you this how many right here would give $5 for a for a Heart full of bitterness 50 cents it's going to go to the highest bidder tonight A Heart pull of bitterness how much you going to give do I got any takers any buyers anything how about it free I'll give it to you free you know it's some cheap junk if somebody won't take it for free you can put out some junk on the side of the road and people grab it but I'm talking about some cheap junk but how how many would take un a Heart full of unforgiveness tonight for $5 any takers no it's cheap junk you w't you won't even take it for free but how many would pay pay if you could pay for eternal life what would you pay come on we're talking about eternal life amen as men that would gave their lives for Eternal to for the thought of the Fountain of Life or the Fountain of Youth and they gave everything they had to try to find it but it's not here to be bought it's here to be freely given something that you can't afford to pie on your home you couldn't do it if you bought if you sold all your houses your land if you had cows if you had cars whatever you had and you sold everything you had you could not buy it why cuz it's here to be freely given she dumped out so she could fill up more oh that's my last bit what if she had that attitude she' have died well it's my last few dollars this my last few dollars I I can't spare that I got to keep that in my pocket for tomorrow and God's wanting to give you more I mean it's just a it's a it's a law of God what you sow you're going to reap I know people have preached the Prosperity Gospel and and you know well if you give you all your money then you going to become millionaires no if you give you God's going to give back that's just the way it is amen God is proving it Time After Time After Time he took slaves you know what he did with slave he said if you'll let go of what you got I'll give you more and he said you're going to pay tith we're talking about slaves we're talking about somebody didn't have nothing and today there're some of the richest people on the face of the Earth Earth why because it was a law of God established in their hearts and that law is still today people get all clammed up and worried about it well I don't know I ties you know I give my ties the church got enough money what about your offerings amen what you going to do when we can't pay the light bill we can't do this amen what is it we got to let go so we can get more yes sir she dumped out so she could fill up God came down when she dumped it all in there God came down filled up the meal Barrel filled up the old jug she dumped it out again in the preacher's plate and it came down again direct quote he dumped it out again and he filled it up when you say you got faith for Divine Healing something strikes you it says move out that's a confirmation that God has received your faith for Divine Healing that's right when you got courage to put your faith in action that's when you say you got faith but you're afraid to let it go your faith is dead but when you got faith and willing to let it go then God's confirming it with signs following and you will see your healing you will see your healing what if Peter stopped that night to figure it out now Lord you told me to walk you said come but let me see now I'm strictly I got some scientific background I know this formula of water it's H2O why no man can walk on hydrogen and oxygen there's there no need to me even tried you ask me something impossible Peter would have never walked on water he would have never figured out how it was he he would have just took God at his but he just took God his word with walking on that's what we got to do don't try to figure out how God is going to do these things how God's going to do this how God's going to do that just accept it and go on what if Moses turned aside to see the burning bushes well let me let me take some of them leaves off and see what what really burnt this let me check it in the chemical lab let me check it out but he never that was he he had never approached God he would have never got anywhere but he just settled his heart took off his shoes of what he said and God sent him down there to deliver amen Peter if he was doing you know he he was doing all right though he stepped out of the boat he's doing real good but he got scared it's real easy to get scared when you realize you have no control that's why we got backseat drivers they get scared cuz they don't have a lick of control Hallelujah anyhow I mean you parents knew how it was when you was teaching your young and how to how to drive you didn't have you hit the break stomp a hole in that do you not see that car it's a police car in front of you for goodness sake one guy said he said they had so many miracles on the way to church from his son driving he said how'd that tree move out of the way but you don't have no control when you don't have control then you get afraid when you lose control it's it's hard to stay stay focused and stay looking at the right things when you lose control of a situation when the doctor says there ain't nothing you can do there's nothing there's no hope it's over with fear wants to come in and things wants to go a in your mind and this is where Peter was when he got out way from that boat he realized I don't have no more control I forgot to put the life vest on yeah and he's about halfway to Jesus and he realized he's looking he said man need some big waves I thought they was big in that boat but now I'm standing on them they're they're huge look at him and he starts looking at all around him and what's going on and he ain't got no control of the situation no more and he starts sinking and people and and I I've used it too and just used it just then of Peter getting his eyes off of Jesus and getting but listen he wasn't the one that was a failure that night night the ones that were a failure was the ones that was still in the boat they never they would never get out of their comfort zone or or their ability they would never come to that place where they would completely let go it's not it's not a fun place to be when you do can't grab a hold of something your world's twirling around could you imagine this wasn't no just platform he was standing the winds and the waves were blowing he's up and down he's he's got all kinds of things his equilibrium was all messed up no doubt probably getting dizzy and things around him and but if he could have just stayed focused the White Caps are man they're biging them heels the phones breaking my Jesus just said Come Peter said well if it's you Lord I'll just walk what a man but but when he got his eyes on the waves he got scared I'm going to walk because the word said I was F the next thing though he started looking at his symptoms he started looking at the waves he he started looking at the issues he started looking at the circumstances and he got scared and he began to sink but that ain't the end of the story even in a scared condition and out of control he said God help me Jesus I'm I'm about to drown and Jesus reached down and he picked him up and he made him walk on the water again amen listen God he sees you out there and he sees you in your struggle and he realizes he's not he can't control this it's over his head it's over his pay grade he can't do nothing about it but if he'll just look to me I'll take care of him if he'll call on me when he's in trouble I'll be there to answer him I'll be there to move on his behalf and he'll make you walk on water the second time Peter just took God at his word left everything he could to get to a place that only God could it's easy to criticize ones who's dared take God at his word and looking like they're about to fail well when the one has taken God at his word it's not up to their own ability ities anymore it's up to God's abilities brand used this story he said like the good old brother colored brother down south said he was packing a Bible and he couldn't even read his name said Moses why you packed that Bible he said because it's the word of God said what do you believe it he said well sure I believe it I believe it from cover to cover I believe the cover also because as God's holy Bible wrote on it well how do you know it's a Holy Bible how do you know it is I believe it that's all well you know you can't even read it but I still believe it that's that's all he had to have just believe it Moses would you do anything that Bible said to do yes sir and the Bible said so I'd do it there you are he said all right MOS now what if that stone fence there if the Lord told you to jump through that stone fence how would you jump through that fence he said does the Bible say for Moses to jump through the stone fence he said well what if God would speak to you and just tell you to jump through the stone fence he said if it was God and he told me to jump I'd jump well how you going to get through that fence without a hole in it he said if it was God he'd have a hole there when MOS got there amen that's how you believe the word of God of God's word said it I believe it that settles it I can run through a troop and leap over a wall they ain't enough armies of the devil can hold a child of God when they realize the power that is calling them to the other side amen when God is calling you to do something and God is calling you to do to move out of your comfort zone and the place that you're in and the situation you're in there ain't enough Devils that can keep you from from it if you believe what is spoken about you you dare take God's word and stand there and say it so he said like this poor little nervous woman here thinks she's going to die and everything else is wrong with her you're not dying how can I do it brother bradam just take his word and step on it once one time once stand on the word see what happens and when you stand there tell the Devil he's a liar tell the Devil he's a liar amen you've been and he said you've been in menopause all these years about 57 years old get away from the thing it's the devil take God's word and say by his stripes I'm Healed watch what takes place then you'll quit thinking you got heart attacks and everything you don't have no heart attacks and all that stuff it's a lie you don't have it just believe God's word and tell the Devil he's a liar but it takes you stepping out and standing upon the word of God cuz I want you to understand something what Peter was really standing on was not just the water he was standing on the word the word said come so if the word said Come Peter could come and if the word said you could be healed amen you're not standing on anything but you're standing upon the word of God you're not standing upon your symptoms you're not standing upon the sickness you're standing upon the word word the word said you could be healed come but if we say we have faith and afraid to step out and claim our faith and put it to work then our faith doesn't do much good the Bible said that faith without works is dead just without just as the body without the spirit is dead so is faith without works we must believe him brother Timothy I don't know how I'm going make we must believe him brother Timothy it's so dark we must believe him well you have you seen what's going on in the world and the situ we must believe him well what about my sickness we must believe him come and as we believe we must act on our confession we can't say it we can't even say it unless we really believe it and then what if we really believe it then we can say it with all our hearts and know that God answers our prayer and will give us the desires of our heart brother when you got a courage enough to step out and Toe to Toe the line with the devil and Scat him off I like that just scat him off if I went to my house tonight I got a legal Deed from my house and I've went there somebody was laying there drinking and carrying on doing wrong I'd say you got to get out of here well this house is for human beings I got a right to be here you do not I possess this house it is mine well I got a right just let sickness enter the body or sin or whatever what the other one drink the other one does this other one he has no legal rights amen well I could take my abstract deed go down the court say look here someone's moved to my house doesn't belong there this is mine it belongs to me the law will come and put them out do you notice what is happening in the political world right now squatters have more right than the legal owners do you notice what's happening in the world right now policemen are put down the law they're put down and criticized and made fun of and thought belittled and all kinds of things to the point if you're not careful you'll drive back I wanted to have an attitude towards them oh yeah it happens cuz all the nonsense you hear well there's so many bad cops and there's so many and there's so many and you hear all this nonsense and before you know it starts infiltrating into your mind into your thoughts towards the law and towards them amen I know there's some bad but there's a lot of good also and without them what would this world be like if there wasn't somebody that would say no you can't do that what would this world be like but the the natural types of spiritual and the devil is also trying to belittle the Holy Ghost the law he's trying to belittle amen the one the enforcer that can come and kick that Spirit out of your house and he's also trying to make you think squatters got more rights than Believers got but that's not the truth we have the rights that devil has no legal rights over any child of God in any part of their house in any part of their body it has no rights Hallelujah and if you just let go and let God God to come in and he'll clean that devil out he'll put him back where he belongs when somebody's moved here and it doesn't belong here this is mine it belongs to me the natural's trying to say it don't belong to you no more squatters it belongs to them no it don't it belongs to me I have a written deed brother and sister we have a written deed to Salvation and Divine Healing the devil has no right the devil has no rights trust God in the Holy Ghost will put him out oh he said I feel religious God promised it God obligated to take care of it God will perform his word it was a blind man we've talked about him many times blind bartus screamed out Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me he was two squares away city blocks maybe away but he realized this was the only chance he was ever going to have he must get his attention he must get an audition with him or he'd be blind always well then how would you act if that was you I wish he said I wish that would be an attitude of every person tonight if you can only get the attention of Jesus you said well brother Brown how how do you how do I know I get this audition when something begins to tell you in the heart this is the truth that's Jesus talking to you so just remember when you attract his attention he begins to talk back then raise up and begin to thank him thank him like this blind man did well I feel so bad when people try to make God something of history and he I want to ask you something what good is a god of History if he isn't a God today what good is the Bible of something yesterday if it ain't the same today what good is a god of Moses if he ain't the same today what good is a god of any Prophet if he ain't the same today but he is the same today he's the same God today yesterday and forever you say well I have faith to believe but you're afraid to Let it Loose what good does it do a bird to have wings if he isn't out of the cage if he don't ever get out of the cage he don't ever stretch out of what good is those wings he got to get out and throw his wings into the air in this

it but turn him loose oh god he's a god he's not just a god of History he's the same day to data and forever when did our God lose power when did he ever do anything different when did he stop healing when did he stop delivering when did he stop setting people free turn him loose Pharisees read the same Bible but they didn't have enough Faith to put into practice what they read every denomination today reads the same Bible but they'll tell you God don't heal Matthew Mark 16 is not you know inspired I love that story about that woman he found a little church that to pray for she got real sick got prayed for her she got healed and her son come home from Cemetery I me sem Seminary come home from that she he said I I heard you was real bad you look good and she said yeah got healed said what do you mean said well I found this church that believed in Mark chapter 16 they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover and I went down there and ask him to pray for me and God healed me he said well Mom we we learned up there in the Seminary that that ain't inspired no more she started shouting bless God hallelujah said well if God can do that with an uninspired scripture what can he do with the inspired but I'm here to tell you it's not uninspired it's the inspiration of God it still works but you got to be willing to let go somebody's got faith enough that'll step out and take the word that's what we need somebody to practice what they believe faith without works is dead doesn't do you any good to have faith you say well I believe that's the Bible Well if it's the Bible it's got promises and if you believe that's true the only thing you have to do is let your faith loose and practice what you believe I felt it twice practice what you believe they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover our pastor has been under it it's time for the Church of the Living God to practice what we believe we're going to lay hands upon this servant of God who's been under
