and he said let the God that answers by fire he restored an altar he restored the word for that generation and the God that answered by fire was the God that came down and licked up the offering so I

William Meade ever need we pray who your children and have gathered in your name now and asking that you'd minister to hearts in Jesus name a man a man god bless you we're gonna let you have your seats right now amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord together today isn't it amen my we appreciate the Lord for His goodness amen appreciate you being here being in the service of the great king of glory and and we got a little something there that we want to make mention of course as you know our our annual meetings are coming up and we got lots of plans for that that will be coming up the second weekend of October starting on Wednesday through Sunday and six great services that I believe the Lord will really speak to hearts and lives amen and so we have that we have brother David mayor that will be coming in a little early to the meetings and and so actually we'll be speaking for us the Sunday before the meetings began he says he's from Switzerland France area and then I never know where he's from because you know he's he I think he lives in in and Switzerland has a church in France and and I usually meet him somewhere else you know so it's always it's always hard for me to tell exactly where he's from but he's from Europe a man and he speaks English so you'll enjoy him he'll be a blessing to you I believe that he's a real servant of the Lord and also I want to thank you for your prayers as we were just visited with brother Kelly Hildebrandt in their annual meeting but there on Spencer and I spoke debt together we just saw the Lord do some awesome things as he just spoke to the people revealed itself through the word and just broke down barriers and opened up understandings of God as God is still God I was just seeing God worked so greatly among that congregation in years past then and this year was no different as we seen the Holy Spirit move and we flew from there directly to Tulsa and went to brother Wendell Martin's and there they were having their church dedication and there the pews that we gave them look really nice there and the ceilin that I think brother Joseph helped them with god bless you for that brother Joseph that helped make this for this building I also carried it right on over there it looked just awesome and they they were just so happy so we we got to be with them in that celebration brother Andrew Glover but there Josh Bennett brother Jonathan Martin brother Shawn Martin brother Wayne Lawson ministered there in the church and then Sunday night that we had a flood and unfortunately they didn't quite get the gutter out where it needed to go and you know they didn't have the the Baxters and Mitchell's here and and everything to put all of that in a dream pipe and get it away from the building and so it they just put in new flowerbeds and it will all look just really really nice and they were just ready for the Sunday morning and here comes a gully washer and and feel their building about that deep with water and and but you know they were resident people and just grab their things and took it over to community center and we had Church and I just reminded them that morning I said well you know what it's it's really not about dedicating a building it's about dedicating the people and so this is more important than even dedicating a building is to have the people dedicated so we had a great time in the Lord also wanted to show you something that's real special you know the other day we did something and showed you what they've been working really really hard on and that was sister Alana but Sue's testimony and we're hearing back from all over the world literally people whose faith has been inspired and lifted up and and they're believing for their own healing and deliverance and and you know but these brothers brother Michael Dexter of course and and others have have worked on I don't know his whole team has worked on it but after getting it done we did it just a little clip and we're going to show you this morning what our brother David Dexter did working with the church down in Florida and brother Danny Stephens daughter-in-law had to try to get it down into the Spanish language and I wanted to share that with you just just right now where you just kind of see and I want you to hear some time ago brother David Dexter said brother Tim what can I do to serve the Lord more I said learn Spanish so you're gonna hear him now put to work and to into use what he has learned in order to get this done were that this gospel can be preached in all the world and so it's in a language now that the video will be released today in the Spanish language for the spanish-speaking people around the world and I want to say to those that are would be listening in today god bless you and God bless you and brother David Dexter and those that worked with him on this go ahead and show it real quickly assistant program instead of a 1 a 0 ez 3 mi primer acid II am a parent or a Burmese Intimus Indian resistance ie its implemented hijo no creo getting at constable moon be hey you know the opposite of Acosta developer or a in the analysis are they missing any person Oona's semana santa lucia vera 13 i constantly made some new DNA they were chosen by me [Music] a blue I bet you didn't know sister Lana and I could speak Spanish [Laughter] all right you know as chapters in our lives one will close and another will open and mean we have many changes in life as years go by and times go by and today we have something very exciting we want to share with you about a young couple here in the church breast and brother Justin ware and sister Lillian petter solely have pledged to be married and they're going to consummate those wedding vows on January the 11th 2020 so we're going to invite them to come here right now as we welcome this new couple here that the Lord has joined together and we just thank God for their their lives and their testimony I think it's wonderful when we have young people in our church that fall in love with one another and get married and a man and put their roots down in that wonderful amen so we certainly appreciate Justin and Lillian and their testimony once wouldn't seem like no time ago the Lord reached out on a service when when Justin's sister asked for for her the salvation of her brother and we were in the prayer line we prayed and while we were praying God moved up on Justin's heart and bring him brought him to church in his pajamas down to the altar and he gave his heart to the Lord and he's never looked back hey man that's a miracle gods feel that mighty miracle working God stand over here just open here I want you to turn around here a man what a wonderful couple this is you know I'm Williams one of my my cousin's my cousin's granddaughters and so that makes a whole Justin here because so you know he's part of the family and so on now he has he's in double trouble he has to not only you know stand up you know for her as far as to me as a pastor but also as a relative so now you know we want to just ask the Lord's blessings upon them today father we want to thank you for this young couple that has pledged to be married and Lord as they enter into this time of engagement we treat this so seriously Lord because we believe that a promise that is made it should be binding and that it should be meaningful and so Lord they have prayed over this and they've talked with me about it and and and Lord now today they've come to announce to the church their decision that they have made and we're asking Lord for your blessings upon their lives that you would just follow them with that mercy and grace all the days of their life may the Holy Spirit Lord just continue to guide them the same one that would go to the bed and bring Justin to church and he'd surrenders heart to the Lord may that he always yield to that voice of the Lord and turn to you with all of his heart for guidance and leadership on the other hand we thank you for Lillian and her testimony and her love for you and Lord as we no doubt would would offer these little ones to you as young children now they're adults we're asking now that your blessings would go with them and that your spirit would follow everywhere they go and then lead them and give them that gentle nudge in every direction they should take for we ask it in the name of Jesus as we bless them in your name amen amen bind us together Lord bind us together congratulations to both of you amen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Lord bind us together [Music] hey ma'am well it's just something about it you know when a man and a woman loves together and pledges to one another we believe that they are to be eternal mates in glory and we believe that you know that there should not be any kissing and touching and and so on before that day where they stand before the church and make that public and give witness and I want to thank Philippi thankful to the Lord for witness enough of seeing young people who serve God diligently and practice that very thing and we just are expecting that of Justin and Lillian that they will continue with diligence the very goal that they set before them a man well I'm about ready to read the scripture but I want us to sing that song in you can help me with it Andrew I've got peace like a river a man I've got peace like a river I got peace like a river in my soul how many's glad for that peace a man let's stand together as we worship the Lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] my I've got door I got joy like a fountain my soul I love I got [Music] [Music] hey man aren't you clap for that love that piece Amen I mean say I've got peace hey man I've got peace like a river it just bubbles up under eternal life hey man I tell you I want you to sing it with just a little more fervor this morning hey man and just say it to the Lord I get that peace like a river not thankful for that I'm clap for the Holy Ghost put lit up and eternal life hey man come on let's sing it now I've got peace [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] these are long blessed be the name of the Lord let's turn to Exodus chapter 15 and verse 26 we want to read from there this morning a man so good to be back with you again after being gone for some time we saw appreciate the brothers who had ministered while we were away and they just didn't want all some jobs so we appreciate the Lord for that amen Exodus chapter 15 verse 26 and said if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God and do that which is right in his sight and will give ear to His commandments and keep all his tattoos I will put none of these diseases upon you which I have brought upon the Egyptians for I am the Lord that healeth thee amen god bless you can be seated we have been speaking on the people of the book have returned to the land of the book and today we're going to be speaking on the return to the land of healing and and of course we have returned to this land of promise and in this land there is healing that's truly a land that flows with milk and honey now of course the land that we have returned to is not the the land of of rocks and soil and rivers and streams that is over there in the Land of Israel today but our land use of the promised land of the Bible and we have been returned back to our homeland and I just want to say how dare how dare we not believe in healing when brother branham often said how can I get you to have faith for a rapture when you won't even believe for divine healing now we we know that's true I mean when you go to and thinking about this a you know that if we can't believe even for God to heal one thing in our body how can we believe her body change amen so we're gonna have to be a people who believe and believe God and take him at his word and accept his divine promises and yeah we know we have doctors and medicine and we thank God for all of them but that does not replace healing they can't heal only God is the healer and so because of that you know one thing that I feel like that we must do in preaching the full gospel we must preach about a goddess heals a God that delivers and and of course no matter what situations arise you know and one may get healed we know that the Satan will come and attack in another way and there's always gonna be needing for healing in the church and deliverance and sums 105 and verse 36 I want to remind you of the scripture that I spoke of some time ago on the in Passover word then he smote all the firstborn in their land the chief of all their strength and he brought them forth were also with silver and gold and there was not one feeble person among their tribes so this is what happened in that Exodus and so we are expecting the same thing in this Exodus a man that there not be one feeble one among us but we see God continually as a Lord God that healeth all diseases now we shared with the world Sunday September the 8th where just before I left the last sermon that I preached here was on that and we showed the testimony of sister lana butts that we just gave you another clip that is now translated into the Spanish language and I just thought I would just stop for a moment as I kind of reminisce during those times of as when reflected back upon that great healing that is now going across the world and people are taking encouragement from it and and as I as I thought about that you know not only was she healed that day but there was also another little couple from Africa South Africa that had written me and said that you know the brothers said I am a minister and I hadn't had a job in several years and we're in a desperate situation and and my wife is rectal cancer and and she's in the fourth stage of the Adhan and it just it just moved my heart you know there's something ought to do I know compassion maybe doing the will of God but compassion is also mercy heaven mercy and I believe in sobriety Christ we ought to be a people that that show mercy and that mercy sometimes may come by us calling on the name of the Lord so that there can be delivered in that name and so I took a prayer cloth that day to the pulpit and prayed over that at the end of the service and and sent that to South Africa we got a report back that the man said I got a job that's unbelievable he said has been waiting for me for several years and he said they've held it open for a couple of years until I came and he said God provided me an incredible job and he said my wife went back to the doctor and don't have a trace of the rectal cancer anymore so I just want to tell you you know I've heard reports from around the world of people with with the insulin-dependent type 1 diabetes who who was facing actually amputation and and was healed by the power of God right while they're just listening to a service so you think God still working and he'll respond to anywhere that he finds faith and that's what God is looking for now you know when we've come with sister Atlanta you know we I did not send her daily encouragement but just only as I was moved by the Holy Spirit her you know and and of course as you know that her healing was verified by the PET scan on February the 19th 2018 when she went to the doctor for her scan that was that was right after the February 18th service where that the Holy Spirit moved that was preaching on the revealing of sons and you remember what happened that day as I was preaching on God doing some extreme things to cause us to believe and and so as I ministered along that line and we come to the end of the service and and and we saw the Holy Spirit just moving and new he began to sing the song leaning on the everlasting arms which became the the name of her or her film and she jumped up from the mezzanine back to the air and ran around the building a couple of times there a woman that was very sick very weak had no energy you know couldn't hardly make it through the day sometimes she had taken for treatments that chemo which the doctors would later admit that he thought the treatments with killer as she was already so sick and underweight and fragile that the treatments themselves would kill her but um you know it was it was during the month of January this took place in February but in the month of January on the in January the 16th just about a month before we would have that service on the 18th of February IRA I just was in prayer that morning and the Holy Spirit just spoke to me to write her and I just wanted to kind of reminisce and show you some of that site and I in my and what I wrote her I said you're continually in our prayers daily and through the night and it's true you know through the night every time every waking moment I would just I would just awake and I just call her name and prayers of God you've got to move we need you on the scene and and I said there's not a day that we neglect to pray for you that your faith will be lifted so the healer names of the Holy Ghost can sweep over you with this healing touch responding to your faith and of course that was in reference to what happened with sister Karen when she was there in the bed unable to see out of her I lost her peripheral vision and and we can that went from a brain bleed and unable to hardly go to the bathroom by herself and laying there and reflecting upon her life in the condition and and feeling sorry for herself and Bethany comes in and puts a little Dru who had never walked at 18 months old undeveloped hip you know they they he was not able to pull up or to walk around a piece of furniture well just stand and tottery hold on to the edge you know just a little but not able to really take steps and what never crawled and there that day as we as as we were there in the house and sister Karen laying in the bed and Bethany my daughter took the little baby true there 18 months old set him at the end of the bed went over to talk to her mama and about that time the Holy Spirit swept through the and took away her blindness and she began to see clearly and a praise went forth out of her lips and it swept all over the end of the bed and swept over a little drew that was layin are sitting there and he raised up out of the middle of the floor not grabbing on to the bed just raised up out of the middle of the floor and ran all over the house he may sweep over you this morning wherever you are even either here around the world if you're a part of his people God's concerned about you and your knee to a man and as I wrote her you know I said that so that your faith might be lifted so that the heel and Angel can sweep over you with this healing touch responded your faith I said we know that faith is a gift to God that each of us possess it is his faith and we are rising to the occasion with you God is not on your side you are on his side and I think sometimes that's what we forget we get to thinking you know um you know that that we you know that God is on our side and I need him to come by our side I want you to understand and man that's not really the way it is God is not on your side you are on his side he's the leader in this this is what he would tell Joshua when he was looking for a way into the city of Jericho and then God would say I'm you know we come there with his sword drawn the captain of the Lord's hosts and and he would declare he would declare to him I am the captain because Justin would say you know are you for us or against us and he would say nay neither Amen I I'm not on your side you're on my side and I want you to understand this morning it is God than his own and that is working on your behalf and you are on God's side but this is not your battle it's the Lord's battle whatever you're going through it's his battle now so I wrote her you know that's where raise the rice into occasion with you God is not on your side you were on his side the battle is not ours it's the Lord's second Chronicles 2015 and he said hearken ye all Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem and not King Jehoshaphat just saith the Lord unto you be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great mustard multitude for the battle is not yours but gods now that's why I want you to start thinking about your battles you're going through and your healing may be on any round it may be on the physical realm it could be in the spirit or the emotional realm it may be in the soul round that is all healing and the battle is not yours but gods sister lana would respond back to me that day in the text and she said I believe that when I was given my diagnosis I told the Lord I was already so weak and tired and I felt like I could not face what was ahead of me and he reminded me that in my weakness he is strong and many times in this journey I've had something to come up that I just had to put on his shoulder because I could not do anything about it and it's such a relief to give it to him I think about the scripture he said cast all your cares upon him for he cares for you she continues said I know he's waiting and ready to do for me more than I could ask or think I am in expectation I only I know it only takes a moment and I'm praying that the channel will be open when it's my moment I've already seen him lovingly caring for me in this situation I know it's a simple matter to him to complete the work I feel like Caleb give me my Mountain so we're so encouraged when someone says they're praying and I know God hears ever one and it does not come back void and the hard times it comforts me greatly later that evening she would write me again and she would say sister Mary Catherine which is sister Mary Catherine Joyner here a godly little sister said send me a card and I received it today and it had the same scripture on it that you sent us this morning as David said out of the mouth of two or three witnesses you know when you're in the situation you got to look for every sign along the road and you got to recognize God in every situation and I responded back and I said okay this of course there's no coincidence this was predestinated and preordained as I was in prayer for you this morning and as I prayed for you this word came to me that I sent you of course I did not even know sister Mary Katherine would send your card but no doubt she too was moved by the Holy Ghost no doubt it was quickened to her that it said just the right thing let me tell you this is not even this morning by chance meeting you're not here by chance you're here because God wants you to know I'm the here whatever your situation is whatever the problem is in your family whatever it is whether it's a mind situation it doesn't matter if you were born with it no matter if it's in your genes this is a God who is a creator this is a God who knows exactly how to create cells you know to remove that cancer he would also have to create new sales so not only did he can remove the from the lungs just there in an answer but he also gave her a whole new set of lungs that would testify of the healing power of God Wow because God is a creator then you've been talking about missing limbs coming back and you've been talking about the power of the spoken word we are already seeing it begin to happen hey man we ought to be under expectations to see God move now I went on and told her because as I reflected on that on that verse I thought you know what are the odds what are the odds that sister Mary Katherine and I would sin the very same Scripture at the very same time and God would move it upon our hearts you know her her receiving that inspiration me receiving that inspiration it coming to her on the very day there to start causing her to believe for something greater than just a healing are you with me and I began to look at it then I realized as I looked I first looked at the King James Version has an even number of verses there's thirty one thousand one hundred and two so you know the chances of us getting it was here one out of thirty one thousand and two chances have sinned in the same verse and I said God sent you two witnesses today by giving you the same verse confirming that he indeed is the leader this battle against Satan for the battle is not yours but the Lord's and then you know as I went on to say realize and this was very significant that sister Mary Katherine and I would send you the same Scripture in the same day I looked at the number of verses that we have could have chosen from the number as I said was thirty one thousand one hundred two and all these pictures there are over 7,000 promises similar to the one that we sent so we picked the same one out of 7,000 the Holy Spirit did and so what are the odds one one out of thirty 1002 that's divine providence and i said while looking up the number of verses i found out another interesting fact the two middle verses of the King James Bible are the first two verses of Psalms 103 1 let's read it together because I want you to see what's in the center what is in the center of God's Word sons 103 1 bless the Lord O my soul I love it when inserts out glorifying God I had of anything a man any before anything happens we're already praising it bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless His Holy Name bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits this is right here in the very center of the Word of God who forgiveth all thine iniquities amen and who healeth all thy diseases I want you to notice in Redemption there is both healing for the soul forgiven of the iniquities and healing of diseases come on now who redeemeth the life from destruction a man so that that mouth is renewed excuse me who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowns you with loving-kindness and tender mercy who satisfies the mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the Eagles the Lord executors righteousness and justice for all that are oppressed hallelujah his righteous justice went out and men condemned that devil declared him dead she went back to the doctor on the next day amen and there a complete clean free scan come on amen this is a scripture that's in the center of God's Word it's to be kept in the center of your focus as he leads you to meet raghava speak that'ss serious voice mr. Lana responded to this and and I just actually pondered on this and I'm just gonna quote her from the video that we just released how can the battle be his if I'm the one fighting it I'm the one down here fighting how can this battle be gods but I saw in the Old Testament that Israelites dealt in the physical realm things that we deal with in the spirits around and I thought how they had to call on God and say look what they've been saying about us God would say go to sleep I got this don't worry about it in the next morning they got up and their enemy was dead and she said she said God I believe if you're gonna fight my battle I believe you're gonna have to do something supernatural for me and for that moment own I didn't just believe for a healin I started believing for something over and above something miraculous [Music] hallelujah oh man and I think that's a way where the church body we in unison ought to be even this morning we're looking for more than just a healing and a gradual thing to happen we can look for the miraculous to take place remember cuz that's God we serve it's who goes to extreme to do extreme things to get his people to start believin a man and that's what I preach on that morning February the 18th that God had gone to the extreme to get us to believe and then we had returned to Bible doctrine with Bible faith with and Bible days are here again I wanted to clear that again this morning don't you ever to forget it we are here in the brides revival come on my way we shouldn't have to be encouraged by the song leader to worship our God to come out of our doldrums a shake of Laodicea where's the private Christ that this is I revival we ought to be here putting everything we got into a worshipping with everything Jimmy prays forgetting life his benefits this is a day of adoption of sons the manifestation or exhibition of the sons of God when true sons born sons filled sons will speak and their words are backed hey man William Branham would say that more than this more than sixty years ago he says I believe we're on the border of it right now yes sir say to this mountain so let it be so we're on the border back there 60 years ago I say where are we today we're advanced we can all see us advanced into the hour of darkness ma'am but shouldn't we also be advanced in the in the faith hey man and seeing God move as he said he would do come on I'm out of quartz in the last year of brother branham's ministry he would declare bad vision the bride in preview and he would see the religious world of America first he would see you know them them coming back and ungodly bunch that would come in to preview from Europe and then he and then then he would see you in a vision he saw and remember William branham's visions were were accurate they were I've every one of them in detail are you with me what I'm not one of them ever fell to the ground my names addresses where they come from and then what their situation was and their whether it whether or not they would be healed every kind of thing was was known I mean even sometimes standing there I'd say one two three four five different surgeries the man who did it is a tall man you know did too many odds what's the guess it was God going to extreme things to get you to believe so that you'd have confidence in the word a man so now it would have this vision of the preview of the church and he would see her can rising up of a Europe of filthy ungodly bunch in morally dress and then then he said now we'll see that the Church of America and he saw the Church of America coming up as a group of women and they were naked from the waist up and of course she's naked as spiritually as well right hey man you did you know here in recent days Colorado is doing five other states legalizing the right for women to go topless in public you didn't hear what I said did you you're still sleeping maybe it's just shocking yeah but now six states have joined together saying it's legal for women to go topless in public and brother branham already saw her religious america dancing to the tune of rock and roll holding some little something in front of like great newspaper with fringes in front of her butt naked from the waist up and he said you know when she passed by there was nothing and leo to see is prophesied to be this way naked wretched miserable blind and don't know it but you realize we're right here in the very fulfilling of Scripture look we we live in a democracy and I'll tell you as much as we love democracy and talk about our freedom and let me tell you it is no substitute for a righteous godly king like Jesus we'll be in the millennium ahead hey man but you see democracy is all sales in the Lanka so that now in the name of freedom and rights they have the freedom to go topless ah you say what brother team not just secular women brother Jim now they're just as religious as they can be and I'm winning when they're when they're with the gays went and done their prophets there their protests here some time ago and then they wouldn't went down there we're children of God too we're God's children too now listen you can't be God's child except you'd be born into his family and that takes a new birth come on now hey man soon you will we're not children of God just because we're Americans or we say we believe Christ it's a bad back we become the child of God but then wait further the more you know their their religious is religious can be and yet and yet they're you know they're demanding the rights well men men can one you know is not a sex symbol and they we go we want to be an equal with man we're we're gonna go out on the streets just like men furthermore they have the right to kill their unborn children divorce for Mary as often as that will fulfill in the days of Noah marriage and given in marriage and that of Sodom and Gomorrah full-blown perversion we're living in the last days Jesus would tell us and give us these these very days of knowing the days of Sodom as examples of what it would be before the judgment strikes but notice in all of this he also solved the bride now the church he saw her naked dancing to the tune of rock and roll and then on the other hand now he sees the bride coming by a man and as he saw her coming to him to preview the second time because he first saw her as a bride a godly little group of women walking down and stepped with the gospel a man and then he then he sees again Europe and then America and then he comes back and it comes into peer preview the second time trying to get something here comes in preview the second time and it showed that the church that was in the beginning of the day of Pentecost will come again at the end time and this time she'll be in step with the word matching to the tune of onward Christian soldiers hallelujah I like it onward Christian soldiers not retreat not looking back not going back to another age not repeating the sins of the ages past but a people is going onward because when we leave this seven days we're going in a rapture onward onward in a rapture outward to a marriage supper I'll do millennium our new heavens and a new earth never backwards that's the reason the bride came in to preview the second time there has to be a church called out of the latter-day like there was in the first day just exactly the three has to come from its roots up to the bride tree like it did that time God's masterpiece again birth pains he would tell the vision again and he would say she is to be the same bride the same time build out of the same kind of material that she was in the first place now read Malachi fuller and see if would not to have a message in the last days that a turn the hearts and the children back to the father's back to the original Pentecostal message word by word and I love this little next citizen he says brothers we are here [Music] hallelujah we're not waiting another age we don't have to wait even Brett another ministry to come remember we have received a message that turned our hearts back to the father's back to the original Pentecostal message word by word brothers we are here but I wonder today sometimes what kind of voice the church has been listening to can you imagine rejecting the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and accept it instead and easy believe ISM just accepting the creeds and doctrines of the message and people never know in his life the god of this evil age brother Branham this is one of this last sermons that he will preach to his home church and I just want to quote a few things from it he says you know it's like when he Satan came to Eve you know he comes they're questioning the Word of God why as long as you go to church and thou believe us the devil believes not make believe but he actually believes and he's not safe if thou believest can you imagine you're rejecting divine healing or you let me just say it to neglect it is to reject it the church has through neglect it preaching faith and preaching healing and preaching deliverance are you with me and to neglect it is to reject it so he said Satan tells the second Adams bride the same as he told the verse such as now divine heal and there's no such a thing we can prove that there's never been a case of it proved and that's what people want to say today in the face of everything that has happened ah it wasn't really so you see Satan's trying today to convince the church to fill her with unbelief why again if we can't believe for divine healing how are we going to ever believe for a complete change of the body and the resurrection of the Dead as brother Branham goes on to say he says you know a quoting what is being said there's no such thing as the baptism of the holy ghost from these days that was only for the Apostle it's past no such thing as prophets even not is not even known as miracles they're unscientific Malecha for that was for another a John 14:12 Jesus didn't mean that Luke 1730 that's just the myth it's misinterpreted wasn't in the original such tommyrot when God comes down in our myths and proves it when he says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he proves that so I don't care who says well not about it God interpreters of word he said he would do this in us last day there will be light in the evening time and there is light for the manifestation of the Son of God it's sad but she sure fell for it again Christ's bride fell for it and she took in the next and intellectual knowledge of some seminary preacher instead of believing the pure vindicated Word of God let me just say this seminary preacher that they may not actually been to college he may just have an education and a degree in the message so to speak and not know supernatural experience let me tell you you got to have a supernatural experience to preach this message and I'll just tell you furthermore if he don't come in and knowing it is this worthless worthless can be it ain't God's Word unless God anoints it so you see again nice announces cause the whole world except scientific leadership the educational program that good Satan has given to her under the name of a church the leadership of an education scientific program I'm picturing you the god of this world when she has Eve had the very filling of God's Word in her hand she could have taken God's Word but what sin did she do to that instead of tearing for the baptism of the Holy Ghost she let science prove to her that the Holy Ghost was only for the disciples instead of keeping divine healing going when she ought to be now is that body on board she ought to be now raising the dead doing great miracles she's let Satan under his leadership a religious man take the Word of God and try to say that that was for another age and she's believed it well you know another age well that was for the divine healing aids and and that was for Laodicea that was just to vindicate the word that was just to prove that God and vindicate that God was sending a prophet and so it did vindicated but it's more than vindication that God sent a prophet it was it was dedicating a message and if the message is preach again he'll also have the same vindication the signs follow those that believe and man Jesus said the things that I do so you do also he said the Bible said go into all the world preach the gospel to every creature these signs have followed them every one of them that believes he denies ever bidden she denies on the supernatural she swapped it for his intellectual conception of the Bible where theologians have put their own interpretation to it and God left them set their dead it's 12 o'clock midnight you see it's a time where there's a another seed has been planted to crowd out the true wheat this is what brother Branham said would talk about and see the discrepancy also in the last year of his ministry he talked about harvest time and he said there's been two seeds so the Son of Man has went forth that's Christ the word has went forth so in his seed the enemy has went forth so in his seed so to see the discrepancy contrary to the Word of God and and he says and then he goes to describe in this just discrepancy when a man stands and says he's a gospel preacher and sin since the days of miracles has passed that is cedar discrepancy when a man stands and says he's a minister pastor of a church somewhere and does not believe that Jesus Christ is the same in every detail except the physical body same yesterday today and forever that see the discrepancy when he says miracles and apostolic ages past that is see the discrepancy when they say there's no such thing as divine healing that is see the discrepancy and the world is full of it and it crowds out and chokes out the wheat so see the discrepancy now I want to talk just a moment I I'm gonna bring you back into some review which I can do not just cause I'm old but because I'm also the pastor here I want to just bring something back to your memory again because you know as I have studied long time for years and pondered and wondered how did the divine healing movement die God didn't change his attitude didn't change his word didn't change so what happened you know the divine healing died because of men's ego and kingdom building not because it God quit healing let's just get it straight God still heals God would send an angel to a man of God send him out with a gift to divine healer - and and even the Pentecostals would stand up in his meetings and prophesy not knowing that had been said on the river on the Ohio River in 1933 that as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of christ here sit with a message to vote run his second coming and then the Pentecostals would do the same thing down here down in Houston Texas a man recall cowboy boots would speak in tongues and another man would jump up and interpret it and it would be the same thing that the man coming to the platform is as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of christ he is sent to forerun the second coming then it would be honest Raider and Kalyn Kansas who is stand up and prophesied the very same thing his brother branham came to the poor but what I'm trying to tell you tell you is the Pentecostals knew they knew it was it was for running the second coming that God was doing some extreme things get a people ready for his coming to turn their hearts back to believing again now before then the majority of Christians didn't know that sickness was from the devil hello before then the majority of Christians believe that sickness was from God and they believed as many do yet today that God placed sickness upon people to discipline or refine them or to bring glory to himself by allowing sickness and suffering and that has been preached that lie has been preached over and over and over again until it's ingrained and so many people today that it's God's will for me to be sick how could i how can I be healed unless I know his will and here's the will of God saying over and over and over I'm the Lord God that healeth thee of all thy diseases and he can't change his mind so he can't change his will and then you're still wondering is it God's will you know that was a condition that the church world was in after seeing the miracles and the crowds and the potential for money and popularity there was many impersonators searched to the to the field now many of them maybe start out with sincere desires to help you helps people but they didn't stay with the pure goals and the purpose that William Branham had and this brought about an AIDS of impersonations has been prophesied in the Bible this has brought us to perilous times and we're going to look at it in the Bible and compare it with the first Exodus but look here in 2nd Timothy 3 and 1 notice always also that in the last days perilous times shall come now we're gonna see the condition men be lovers of their own selves that's Laodicean self lovers rich increase me good have need of nothing god i don't even need you lovers of them own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent whether that means without sexual restraint fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god having a form of godliness oh yeah religious churchgoers come on that believe Jesus I love Jesus having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof now what power we're talking about denying the power to live for coming life hey ma'am and he said from such turn away for this sort are they which will creep in the houses and lead captives silly women laden with sins let away with divers lust don't you know that women are today our prey of the devil going out into our society convincing them that of equality and freedom to go topless and public to kill their babies tor doing silly women laden with Sam's come on now and the same thing today you know goes right down silly women women who won't be subject to the word of God amen let away with divers lusts he said it would be in this deceitful age and we come right down to it it's not just women but it's the churches who are women also silly women laden with daggers lost we want a million more and 44 we we want more names we want more membership with and first thing you know that the trucks is a cage full of every unclean and hateful bird and every kind of evil spirit is sitting on the pews churches leading away with sins with divers lusts ever learning huh more why you you you could feel this whole church with religious literature today written by theologians of all kinds more books than ever come on ever learning never able to come to the knowledge of the truth then it comes down and says now as Jenison jamberries withstood Moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the faith but deysa proceeding further for their folly shall be made manifest shall be manifest unto all men as there's also where now notice he names them Janus and Jeffries not even written in the Old Testament but in the New Testament is written what their names are Janice and Jambres withstood Moses and we know what they did here comes Moses out with the sign any man and his sign was he had a staff in his hand and he would throw it down it would become a snake a Cobra right and then then the house as it was crawling crawling over he'd go over there pick it up and would come to the snake again he was showing the power that was in the message to bind Pharaoh's kingdom under the signing of Cobra hey man you know that the chief of demons and he had the power there and he walks into Pharaoh's court and said I've got the power to bind you loose you hey man but what happened a couple of midgets magicians come out Janice and Jen briefs they're gonna they're gonna imitate what he did to hardened the heart of Pharaoh to keep them in bondage now God has a desire for his people to be free free from organization free from men's ideas come on I've been free to serve him with all her heart that's what God wanted for Israel but there was certain men Jenison jamberries who was inspired to harden the hearts of a rotor to keep him from to cause him to not let the people go what to keep them in Egyptian bondage are you with me keep him if we would bring him today in the organization and denomination a man and band that Mike reasoned darkness rather than being free to serve the Living God hey man now you say how did they do it you said brother Tim they did that by Satan's power Satan can't create and Satan can heal is that right they were they were using that we're using God's power I meant to imitate Moses gift you see that's what people don't understand the Bible tells you that there will be anointed ones in the end time and they would have true anointing yet defaults seed so there are no any ones at the end time the Bible said the Bible said in Mathew 24:24 that that that there would arise false Christ's plural in other words that would be many saying I'm anointed a man saying I am anointed but they're false and they're false prophets of course you talk about brother Branham being a Providence verse scripture they want to point you to this don't identify brother Branham this identifies the false prophets that are out there in the world today and men that are saying I'm anointed and even show great signs and wonders so that to do what if it were possible to deceive the elect but there's something about it the elect will not be deceived now so again janus janus means he vexed he was there two vets to vet C Israelites to vex Moses man he was there Janus meaning foamy healer voet my foamy healer in other words blowed up with a lot of air and these were the two Egyptian magicians who were in the presence of Pharaoh who imitated the miracles of Aaron and Moses and in order to destroy his influence with the King and it worked and the Bible tells you to work in the end time because in Revelation 13:8 said that all will worship the Beast and His image except those whose names are in the Lamb's Book of Life so you see it's gonna be a whole several deception in the last day when you think about a rapture it's not going to be billions of people going it's gonna be the Oh God going in a rapture yeah they'll be built there maybe billions by the time the resurrection but out of this age a handful in comparison are you with me this is a time of darkness upon the earth a time war impersonators abound Jenison jamberries who withstood Moses with their impersonations who are able to convince many not to get under the blood don't apply the token don't take a lamb you know some Jewish scholars say it was only one in fiber Israelites that left Egypt with Moses meaning that nearly 20% only 20% of the Israelites left Egypt and of course this was demoralize the others you think about how how its hurt you for so many of your friends and loved ones and and relatives too to be pulled away and I had to send some secular religion and lastest loss can be and of course this would cause many to go back to Egypt in their heart as they were there along the journey but let's just go back for a moment as I have said God was doing some extreme things in our generation an angel would come in 1946 he would come there as brother branham was there in prayer about his misunderstood life because preachers were saying that it was a devil that was upon him and he kept hearing the voice of God speak and telling of situations and so on and his pastors and that's the devil man you better get away from that and he said I don't want to be a devil so there he when he felt it as the Spirit of God moved over on him he went into his cabin there near a cave and there he went into prayer and the angel Lord visited that night a little Kentucky preacher and it's heralded one of the greatest divine healing moves I'm going to say it's been the greatest divine healing movement ever God waited to this generation to do it to display before the Gentiles the same thing that he did when he walked the shores of Galilee to sell himself the same healer the same deliver the same Savior and then to get you to stop believing hey man it was two four run the second coming of Christ as I said to get you to start believing again to return us back to the faith anybody ought to know when we look at it I mean yeah look at we got 40,000 different denominations and every one of them call in the South to faith and yet there's only one Lord one faith one baptism one God one father of us all is that the Bible amen so how do we get 40,000 of one there's only one and they can't all be right so God would have to show us what is right the coming of the angel to brother Branham would start the divine healing movement which would inspire asleep in church and awaken their faith trying to help spread the word there were men that rose up to help brother Branham and you know while he's praying for the sick and and fasting and talking to the Lord and in having visions they would they would do the the groundwork and setting up meetings and purchasing a tent and you know doing things to help whatever they could and they organized so the voice of healing with a magazine with the same name and virtual is use exclusively to inform the public of brother Bradley's meetings that testimonies and miracles and so was to inform the people but you know brother Branham wanted nothing to do with with the money or the popularity derivative that was derived from the angelic visitation and from the result miracles so he allowed men like Gordon Lindsay Jack mower here from life Tabernacle in Shreveport to take over the day and make a little organization in a magazine because he was a man too sincere to dedicate it to God service to desire a big organization in the kingdom for himself and and then and just a little later on it you know just he said it's too much it's too much for me I I I got kid I don't believe in organization and and my this was organized just so tight I want to be free where God can lead me and he just would give up the voice of healing give up his magazine I don't want it I don't want the money I don't want nothing another battle all I want to do is help God's people let's say thank God for somebody that sincere a man so sincere that they would come and offer him a half a million dollars or more at a time to take and he would return it down said I don't want it listen he wasn't too simple or too illiterate or too naive to build the kingdom for himself but he wasn't that at all he was capable you know he could have surrounded himself with men and been a Multi multi multi-millionaire but he just wanted to introduce Jesus Christ to the world and show to the people that God still cares for his people I think that's what our message is gotta be about today and we really are preaching the message it ought to be a message God still cares about his people he's still concerned about the sick no matter what the situation is it would be a decade later 1955 that brother Branham would take a careful examination of his ministry and by this time the fields was crowded with competitors you know men who had run you know say been inspired that God would heal but now and it turned into who can have the biggest - that's the biggest ten who has the most subscribers to the magazine and it all began to be about preachers and the ego I'm trying to tell you why divine healing movement died he didn't die cuz God died he didn't die because God quit the healing business it is it didn't die just because it got Ben Decatur the messenger never and then quit quit quit doing that anymore no it's his word but yet the man with the angel who came to him and was the most gifted had no magazine no tent no ego just a sincere desire to help God's people on the other hand all Roberts who came to see what was going on and said would God hear my prayer brother Branham and he goes out and he builds a university named it after himself of are you and he joins the United Methodist Church because they offered more leniency and doctrine and moral issues and Pentecostal Holiness Church and so he positioned himself as a mainstream denomination to be more accepted and then you know you remember I told you and it's on the tapes 1955 brother Branham will abruptly quit and go home because it was not enough money to cover the campaigns and he had promised god I'll never beg the people for money we take up an offering but I'll never beg him for money and and and there was the the men there was saying to let us let us beg the people you know for some money they'll give more he said no I promise God will pass the plate if that doesn't do it you know then and then way you know we we won't do anything I'll quit I'll go home we've got to pay the bill he was $15,000 in debt this is equivalent to about a hundred and thirty thousand dollars and our money today and during the Dern subsequent investigations it was found that his manager Gordon Lindsey of the the voice of healin was taken most of the money for his own use it says in wikipedia tells us that Lindsey made $80,000 to manage brother branham's campaigns what brother branham made the equivalent of sixty-two thousand dollars so you know again you know what ones making excuse me let me let me read this verbatim said brother Branham had the salary of seven thousand where Lindsay made eighty thousand to manage his campaigns in today's money brother Branham made a salary of sixty-two thousand while Lindsay pocketed seven hundred and fifty thousand for the year and all of this went to the voice a healing Foundation which he later changed her name to Lindsay's Christ for the nation in Dallas Texas built a Bible School you see it's just like Elijah you know when Elijah went here when the lights are refused the money from naming the leper you don't get haze' the servant took it in becoming a leper you know brother Brown didn't want the money well Lindsey did and he building kingdom with it and I'm an complete with a Bible School so you see it wasn't at all that God had failed to provide it was that men with their own greed and agendas was misusing the funds and again now the the field was crowded with impersonators telling the biggest tip the most miracles that the most on the television and television programs to exploit them and the man who had been visited by the angel with the real message was pushed aside by the masses he's the only one with a real gift only one met by an angel the others are running off of his reputation like I said I spoke to you about Jaco he came to see he was a simile God preacher he came to brother branham's meetings he was a skeptic he didn't he he just didn't believe all the reports that God was healing and doing what he was doing and he thought that was a sham so he went out there to to it to watch it and see and find out there was a sham for herself there was a man that was blind with no eyeballs brother Branham told him on the platform in three days it will be eyeballs form in your head and after that you'll see and brother Jack Jack Kui he scoffed said anybody could say that's and you know yeah I mean he's gonna disappear into the crowd and and and and go out we'll never know we'll never know whether or not they're ever eyeballs ever formed we'll never know this so he was a skeptic and he's sitting on the platform and his brother branham exited the platform he stopped by stopped and he touched jack on the knee and prayed softly and said jack he's already said that sir you're not sick you're just worn down from preaching meetings and don't be skeptical you were doubting whether this was of God I want to tell you this is of God and we're both fighting the same devil go and continue a revival for you were also called to pray for the sick Jack said he left a meeting that day he said on cloud nine you know he was gonna have a he's called to pray for the sick too but I he he come back on the third day to see if that man should back up who knew who was prayed forward no I boss said that he found him found him in the crowd there and he had found him that eyeballs had formed in his head and by evening the blind man was seeing and he's satting all over the place man because he said William Branham was raised up for dispensational purposes hey man no but then you know it would turn out to be who has the biggest ten who has the most subscribers who's the most popular on television you'd have oil Jagger's another man who would get inspired a similar God preacher inspired by the miracles and started our prior tribes humbly but seeing that he could be enriched with the crowds not having gifts or an angelic visitation he got he's got sort of promoting the sale of blood and oil and and that he sold for the purpose of healing and vitamins from the Dead Sea and baptizing people into eternal life claiming they would never die all kinds of fanaticism and the same thing that would happen the oral would turn and clean the power of God in his right hand and then turn off to a prosperity gospel you know planning the fee to see the faith in my ministry and send me money and God bless you and you know financially in return he joined the more liberal Methodists and song deny his Pentecostal roots you know here give this since their folly what's being made manifest and I'll tell you what is even going to be worse than that I mean when God takes this bride up and takes you in a rapture and the rest are left behind for the tribulation come that's when the folly of all of this other nonsense will be made manifest but I'll tell you what once you just stay true to the Word of God amen because God's gonna have a rapture for a church now I just want to cover some things and I'm trying to hurry but in 1955 brother Branham has a tenth vision he's shunned at third Pole I throw that which is third phase of his ministry three phases first he's shown the managers are mishandling there's money misusing the funds that their emphasis was of money saw them taking an offering but no altar call was given and brother Branham said when did they offering become more important in souls and they said well we dismissed the meeting we took the operon and and the end he said what you know they said so they've come again so whenever when will they be here well what time does the next service are anytime he said there won't be nobody here you the the campaigns are mismanaged you there won't be nobody here and one of them turned over to me and said well what in Christ left foot twelve when he told him the truth identifying what would happen if you stay with the truth the masses are gonna leave and this was a fall of the divine healing campaigns it became about money prestige popularity and you know and nobody nobody who wanted to attract crowds and the masses would preach the truth so now holiness is a priest righteousness isn't preached you know yes God's gonna bless him give me money and god bless you and here here it goes right on down a prosperity gospel believe anything you want to turns right out into the charismatic movement let me let me tell you friends God's gonna have a people who will walk with the word who believes a Bible faith of Bible doctrine a Bible truth who preached Bible holiness hi ma'am there are people who stand for God in this last day who will do exploits in trouble about the impersonators brother branham was seeking the Lord and he had this vision of the tenth vision the third poll were miracles were performed in a little room away from the eyes of the impersonators the third poll is to open the word to greater deliverance it was to open the seals does open the mysteries that close that he closed the promises of God to us in the tenth vision part of the third poll he he saw the working of miracles that couldn't be impersonated there were miracles and healings and delivers that were brought on by the word being released under the influence of the mighty angel now I want you to think of this for a moment because he would see out of the eyes of the impersonators he said this one will not be impersonated and he saw a piece of canvas and behind a piece of canvas in the tent was a was a was a little room about a 20 by 20 and he said that went through that little room and he said I watched him and there was a prayer line I've got a point for all of this there was a prayer line that went out around the building and down the street to come into this little room and he said I there the angel of God told me I will meet you in there and he said the things he told me in there I'll take it to my grave it will not be impersonated but I want you to get it he said I also saw that there was a prayer line that had been made our altar call rather that had been made and he said people were weeping and crying everywhere come into Christ and he said oh that looks better now won't you get something we preached about the opening of the word we preached about the seals being open we preached about the mighty angel that has revealed his word and the mysteries of God have been revealed don't we preach that but with that third pole comes an altar call are you with me you cannot be preaching the truth on this message and it don't bring people do announcer hey man and let me bring out the next point I want to bring up you cannot be preaching the third pull of this message don't have a prayer line [Applause] where miracles are happening you know today people want to claim that they're preaching the the third pull of brother branham's ministry and there's no miracles there's no sign there's no prayer line we don't even want a prayer line today we don't even pray for the sick you know you know God God you did that to vindicate a prophet same same hope Church of Christ spirit then followed there and then come up and said well that was in the days of Jesus and the possible God don't do that anymore I want you to know Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah have we really preach the message we will be bringing people to an altar took me Christ parsley and we will pray Braille up to a place where in a prayer line they can have deliverance and I I don't care how the compare line is conducted Amen I don't care which way it happens it matters not to me whether when we're preaching that someone gets healed and jumps out of their seat and runs around the building without hands being laid on them amen I think our whole church ought to be a prayer line hallelujah I think a whole church ought to be an altar I think it ought to be an atmosphere the Holy Ghost what songs were saving sinners with the later Christ that's a sick are healed the people are delivered brother branham would see it again just before preaching on the seven seals and he said a sword dropped into his hands and he said this is that third pull it's the Kings sword and I want you to know where God keeps his sword he don't keep it in a sheath God's sword is in his mouth and the sword the message God gave you is not for decoration we walk out in the parade we got this big sword oh we we're the man we're the bride or we are the people daddy what is for the sir is to be in your mouth because that's where God holds the sword hey man you are to speak to your Mountain you want to claim your promised brother branham would show us the power of that and he said it's five times has been vindicated and I don't have time to really go into all the details of it but but but it would be squirrels that were spoken to existence God supplying the need it would be it would be winds and storm that was spoke to and sit back for where it came from man it would be Hattie writes to children there that would come to Christ as the word was being spoke fell on their knees and repent right there are you with me and man it was feet the word and there a tumor would leave sister Brandon's body about 2,000 miles away show it the word has no limitations man it'll go right over to India right over into Africa no matter wherever you are today it'll go right there and it'll cut out diseases healing heal the sick in a rage sedan provide for the needs of God's people because it's a where the comes for the power Alleluia he'll speak to the storms in your life we should not be the tormented we should be the torment or come on now if we're like Jesus Jesus said the devil said what do you torment us before our time hey man I just want to say the devil what are you doing trying to be the Tormentor where's the Tormentor oh my we have been sent here the tear Satan's Kingdom down we have been sit here hallelujah spit against a devil children walking freedom [Applause] of Christ brother branham would say the world is supposed to be in our mouths - now we know that the church is his body come on somebody if the word the Bible said the soulard is in his mouth out of his mouth goes a sharp two-edged sword all right come on now let's bring it right down so the church is his body hey man so it's here the church is here taking his place and what will be in the mouth of the church the word quit using it for decoration put it in your mouth the Patmos vision he said Paul said that the word came in power as well as voice the word preach actually demonstrated itself like a flame and cutting sword it went to the consciousness of men and like a surgeon's knife it cut out the diseases it set captives free and everywhere those early believers went that were preaching the gospel the word and God confirmed the word with signs following the sick were healed the devils were cast out they spoke in new tongues that was the word in action Oh hallelujah Oh today we don't believe in speaking in tongues no more we we don't believe in the sick men healed and devils being cast out how that was that's in the past that's the word in action a man in the word can you hear me now the word has never failed in the mouth of believing Christians and in this lesson how many believes were in the last scenes in this last age it is here stronger greater XANA get the true word bride Oh little flock you little Minari hold on to the word fill your mouth and your heart with it and someday God will give you the kingdom hallelujah glory to God hallelujah the impersonators are know nothing about it but let me hear let me just read you a few things as we try to bring this to a close this morning but in the Dyckman message brother Brennan said may there come forth a revival of the just how many how many years are just today the righteous and may may there come forth a revival of the righteous the just and a great power come among the church just before it's going and it's not how listen it's not hard to pray that because you promised it and we're looking Lord for that third pole that we know will do great things for us and I mixed and why Christ speak he would take Moses standing there having been commissioned and sin and rather than taking the word and use it he began to cry to God you know what must I do what must I do he said it's just like humans we get into a situation you know one day we're on the mountain glory to God look all our enemies dead we we left out of Egypt triumphantly then we get him down and we're back down in the doldrums Brotherhood victory was great there it's gonna be greater here come on God doesn't change his mind he said you're going through the promised land and I'm telling you God hasn't changed his mind either about his word there's going to be a people inherit the entire promise of God so I cried in me Moses why are you crying to me when I proved I'll be with you haven't I healed your sick haven't I told you that which had happened just exactly your posture can't do that mean he can't he's a man it's me the Lord he would say I'm the one that did this I'm the one that tells him these things to say it's not him it's my voice and I'm the one that raises up your dad when they drop down I'm the one that heals the sick I'm the one that foretells these things I'm the one that does the saving I'm the one to give the promise God give me courage to take that sword of the word that he put in my hand about thirty-three years ago and hold it and march forward to the third pole that's my prayer hallelujah he would preach the sermon called spirits of food and due season and he would tell us there's a food for a season in Asus perience of food and he said he gave the illustration there about if he's the same yesterday today and forever he run prayer lines he people come to him in great lines multitudes he touched them and blessed him come on people people are there today we don't need prayer lines we don't need laying hands on this thing sure I get it you can get it in your seat sure I get it but I'll also get it that the Bible said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover we believe in the four Gospels don't we yeah there are times out and depends on how the inspiration of the Lord comes times were the word he just spoke and it happens are you with me said the woman there came there that and that touched him Center any center but bloody she was gone her faith it made her whole so what did she do turnaround said well I don't know Lord I've had this a long time and that's what we do we get prayed for or we get a touch well you know I've had this a long time I've been waiting her this is serious now brother Tim you know if she had done that it wouldn't have happened you see that's an expression of out what have you told the symphonies and woman you know because this word that you said your daughter the devil is going out of her ass and what if she said when I Lord I wanted you to do it this way the devil would have still been in the girl but she expected to find her child the way he said she would find him are you with me hey man so he said now he told us now here again this is what he told the woman with the blood issue this is what he told us sirrah Phoenician woman by the way let me just get something straight he tells us here Phoenician woman who is crying after him since she's a Gentile and he says I'm sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel and said is it right for me to take the children's bread and give it to dogs and of course the little woman that didn't change her didn't matter what God called her a man she just admitted the word was true and man and she just accepted it for herself but yeah even dogs get the crumbs that are under the master's table right but here's what I want you to get out of that whole saying is that he said is it right to give the children's bread divine healing so let's get it straight then if you're a child of God divine healing is your breath it's your valuable right the devil has no right to steal your bread and you've got it right through that Fred he's got a right and say by His stripes fire beautiful Apple child of God peasants a child of God this is my bread provided by my father now he said the man who preaches a social gospel don't believe that at all he woke up the door stand there and so well just another bunch of holy rollers and walk away he don't know that this is the hidden food he don't know this is a secret thing that's hid from him he doesn't know it it's pitiful a mind that's naked miserable blind and don't know it that's a bad thing Oh amen but oh tell me it's not hid from us this is our food this is the hidden food that God allowed for the last day say to the mountain hey man be moved don't doubt in your heart when you pray believe you receive it it shall be given to you and brother bread and said it's a pitiful thing a mind that's naked miserable blind don't know it that's a bad thing but Oh God let me die first don't let me get like that I'd rather die yes sir than to do that and I think every one of us would wouldn't we hey man but you see God we're great the yoke of sickness I'll be your life now I'm trying to bring it out to you I don't care if it's old sickness I don't care if it's emotional healing listen they're people that get bruises in life and they carry about a bunch of baggage because of their past but I'm telling you there's even healing for that that you do not have to continue taking the sins of your past because this is a Lord God that forgive all of your iniquities and equities was with you even knew better than to do it you did it happen God will even forgive that he's here to heal the body the spirit and the soul he will broke him break the yoke of your sickness you don't have to be bent over by the weight that the devil puts on you you are not the devil slave he said in Exodus 15 that we read I am the Lord that healeth thee he said in Exodus 23 25 I will take sickness away from the midst of thee oh yeah hey man notice he says let's just read it I've just got just a little more time I was gonna quit early today I have good intentions Exodus 23 25 you wouldn't be sure it was me and you shall serve the Lord your God and he shall bless thy bread somebody say Amen and thy water and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee and then so nothing cast their young nor be barren in thy land and the number of thy days I will fulfill are you with me now number one I will take sickness away from you number two the number of your days I will fulfill yeah we got a number of days yeah we got a number of days let me just say somes 139:16 and this is another translation but your eyes saw my unformed substance in your book were written every one of them the days were formed for me when as yet there was none of them he was saying Joe but chapter 14 and five since his days are determined and the number of his monsters with you and you have appointed his limits that he cannot pass Joe 14 one through six man who's born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble he comes out like a flower and withers he flees like a shadow and continues not and do not open your eyes on such a one and bring it me into judgment with you who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean there is not one since his days are determined and the number of his monsters with you and you have appointed his limits that he cannot pass - God knows yeah you say well brother Jim I tell you I'm sick I'm gonna die we're not necessarily well he knows my days yeah he does and their number yes they are but I'm gonna tell you I'm not gonna be cheated of any of them you remember a man in the Bible by the name of Hezekiah and the Prophet told him your time is up amen you've come to your allotment of days and has the concert had given up and curling up and dying he set his face to the wall and he asked God for more time a man God said there's an appointed time and it was an appointed time but when a man turned to his God and says I need an extension of my life yeah I've got a sickness unto death but I don't have to die when I got a God like I got who is it either of all diseases hallelujah the Providence said thus saith the Lord set the house in order and thou shalt die not live now that's the words of a prophet and yet he turned his face to the wall and prayed unto the Lord and said I beseech you O Lord remember how I've walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and he wept sore and God's in His Prophet and turned him around to go back and tell him I heard his prayer and I'm extending his days hey man you remember the children of Israel they were faced with death at the time of their Exodus and there they were they were they were have a spiritual deliverance there from Egypt coming under the blood and as soon as they were accepted and become believers and children had accepted God then the enemy physical death took after him and so he had him cornered up right there on the desert side the Red Sea on one side mountain on another Pharaoh's army coming in pursuing with millions of soldiers coming in to march to overcome them now God had already shown them he could deliver him by the blood of the Lamb man but now he's going to show them physical Redemption see both for salvation and healing for the natural man and the spiritual man right so he saves him spiritually down in Egypt there from death come on he brings him right down and now he's going to bring in the physical deliverance and the Death Angel passed over knowing God had made a way of escape through the offering of the blood and they accept it now he's going to make a way of escape from physical death says like the believer as soon as he gets saved maybe a cancer has eaten him up or some disease God has redemption also through power the same that he has tension for the Soul he has redemption for the body they were saved they were sanctified they were under the blood but yet Pharaoh the enemy was going to destroy them kill them all in the wilderness this God showed his power of redemption for the body Redemption by power and then the enemy was really right and nearly on them that great pillar of fire supernatural pillar of fire raised up over Israel come and stood that between them and death did anybody hear that the great supernatural Cloud of God listen this cloud that came a man suing seven angel soon there all dangers were complete it is not just for display on your wall it is a wall of fire about us it is the pillar of fire to stand between you and your enemy stand

would walk just as normal as they could be they do refuse to know anything else you're scared you're afraid to make the start you're waiting for God to come down and pull you out God doesn't do that way you're the one that has to make the step it gives you the promise that says come on and then you follow a man now you said notice the children of Israel God came and stood between them and the danger the power Redemption Redemption by power Redemption by blood Redemption by power there they're all the enemies their chariot wheels have been taken off their horses spooked in the middle of the river and amazing on the wires wheels might down in the mud and fell off a bunch of men frantically running the enemy and the Israel climbed up on the bank to seek God stretched forth his hand and destroy all the enemy a beautiful type the believer under the blood been healed then by the go-between the power of God sparing his life prolonging it for time that everyone been killed right there he had been massacred there in the wilderness if God hadn't stood between them and he said univis dead a long time ago if God hadn't stood between you and death every one of you so God in His sovereignty
