[0:01] [Music]
[0:04] Lord, you brought
[0:07] me through
[0:09] sorrow and
[0:13] shame and you were
[0:17] there. Every time that I
[0:24] call, you reach down and lifted
[0:30] me out of sin
[0:34] shame. But today,
[0:38] Lord, just
[0:40] let me
[0:45] fall. Let me fall.
[0:48] fall in love with
[0:51] you all
[0:53] over
[0:55] again. Just let me know
[0:58] you as
[1:01] never before.
[1:05] Oh, let me
[1:09] hear your tender voice saying let
[1:14] me come in and let me
[1:19] willingly
[1:22] open the door.
[1:27] I've been
[1:29] traveling this road
[1:32] now for
[1:34] many long
[1:36] years. I've been
[1:39] watching and listening for your
[1:45] [Music]
[1:47] call. I've crossed
[1:49] many
[1:51] rivers. I've climbed
[1:54] mountains so tall, but still my prayer,
[1:59] Lord, is to have a greater fall. Y'all
[2:04] sing it to him
[2:05] now. Just let me
[2:09] fall in love with
[2:12] you all
[2:14] over again.
[2:17] Just let me know you like
[2:21] never
[2:26] before. Let me
[2:29] hear your tender voice saying let me
[2:35] come in and let me
[2:39] willy
[2:41] open that door. Sing it to him again now
[2:44] with all your heart.
[2:45] [Music]
[2:47] Let me
[2:49] fall in love with
[2:51] you all
[2:54] over
[2:56] again. Just let me know you like
[3:01] never
[3:06] before. Let me
[3:09] hear your tender voice sing. Let me come
[3:16] in and let
[3:19] me
[3:21] open the
[3:25] door. Now I've been
[3:29] traveling this road
[3:31] now for
[3:34] many long years.
[3:37] I've been
[3:39] watching and listening for your
[3:46] call. I've crossed
[3:49] many
[3:51] rivers. I've climbed
[3:53] mountains so tall. But still my prayer,
[3:58] Lord, is to have a greater fall.
[4:06] Let me
[4:08] fall in love with
[4:11] you all
[4:13] over
[4:15] again. Just let me know you like
[4:21] never before.
[4:26] Let me
[4:28] hear your tender voice saying, "Let me
[4:34] come in and let me
[4:43] [Music]
[4:45] willingly. Just let me
[4:48] willingly
[4:50] open the door.
[4:54] [Music]
[4:58] [Applause]
