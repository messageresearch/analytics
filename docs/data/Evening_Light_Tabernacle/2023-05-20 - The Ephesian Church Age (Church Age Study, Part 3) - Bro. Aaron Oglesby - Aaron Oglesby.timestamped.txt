[13:16] here from the second chapter
[13:23] we'll read verses one through five
[13:27] and it says unto the angel of the Church
[13:30] of Ephesus write these things saith he
[13:32] that holdeth the Seven Stars in his
[13:35] right hand who walketh in the midst of
[13:38] the seven golden candlesticks I Know Thy
[13:41] works and thy labor and thy patience and
[13:45] how thou canst not bear them which are
[13:47] evil and thou has tried them which say
[13:50] they are Apostles and are not and has
[13:53] found them liars and has borne and has
[13:57] patience and for my name's sake has
[14:00] labored and has not fainted nevertheless
[14:02] I have somewhat against thee because
[14:05] thou has left thy First Love remember
[14:08] therefore from whence Thou Art fallen
[14:10] and repent and do the first works or
[14:13] else I will come unto thee quickly and
[14:15] will remove thy Candlestick out of his
[14:18] place except thou repent amen let's pray
[14:23] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're just
[14:25] thankful for this opportunity to gather
[14:26] together with this group of young people
[14:28] and and those that have gathered to
[14:30] support Lord not just pray that you'll
[14:32] come and that you'll speak and that
[14:34] you'll just help us Lord not to
[14:35] necessarily just look at some slides and
[14:38] read some things but Lord I pray that
[14:39] you'll just unveil yourself to to Hearts
[14:42] tonight Lord and that you'll just show
[14:43] us father and allow us to see them even
[14:46] the mistakes not just the glories of the
[14:48] past but the mistakes of the past so
[14:50] that we Lord won't make those same
[14:52] mistakes I pray you'll just come now and
[14:54] move and speak to hearts in the name of
[14:56] Jesus we pray amen amen you can have
[15:00] your seats
[15:02] it's good to be with you all again for
[15:04] another church age study we're going to
[15:06] be looking tonight at the chapter three
[15:07] not all of chapter three because it is a
[15:09] quite a long chapter and I just had you
[15:11] to read um half of the chapter and yet
[15:15] still that half was longer than most of
[15:17] the other chapters that we have done
[15:19] and so we're looking at chapter three
[15:21] the Ephesian age now this age is is
[15:25] important to us because we we point back
[15:28] to it so often because that's where the
[15:31] the church began there on the day of
[15:33] Pentecost so this is the age of Paul and
[15:37] the age of Peter the age of Stephen the
[15:40] age of the Apostles this is that First
[15:43] Apostolic age and
[15:46] brother Branham begins to talk and he as
[15:48] he begins to to look at this he says
[15:51] that I sought God for many days for the
[15:55] inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[15:58] he says then only did I read the
[16:00] scriptures on the church ages and delve
[16:03] into the many Church histories
[16:06] and as I read this I thought that this
[16:08] was an awesome thing because if we go
[16:09] back to early one of our first studies
[16:11] he tells us how that you can never pray
[16:15] too much for Revelation he tells us you
[16:17] know that you should always be praying
[16:19] for Revelation seeking and it encourages
[16:22] my heart when I see the prophet of God
[16:24] that he does exactly what he tells us to
[16:27] do he doesn't just take it upon himself
[16:29] and think well I'll be able to read
[16:30] through this and understand these things
[16:32] but he begins to seek God for Revelation
[16:36] and I want to remind or remind you and
[16:39] encourage you again not to just come to
[16:41] church services and just think you know
[16:43] I'm just going to sit there and the
[16:45] preacher is going to say some good
[16:46] things and we're going to enjoy it but
[16:48] come seeking Revelation come seeking
[16:51] more from God and and not just a head
[16:53] knowledge but come seeking that God will
[16:55] reveal himself to your heart amen and he
[16:59] says he says I was enabled by the Holy
[17:03] Spirit to see unfolded a pattern so as
[17:07] you go through the church age book it's
[17:09] not just brother Branham studying
[17:11] histories and look we could all go study
[17:13] histories and I promise you we wouldn't
[17:14] have been able to come up and write the
[17:16] church age book but what it is is there
[17:18] was things revealed to him the Holy
[17:20] Spirit allowed him to see a pattern that
[17:23] that unfolded and I say Lord reveal
[17:26] yourself to me tonight open yourself up
[17:29] to me tonight and he says that he was
[17:31] able to find a key he says that the lord
[17:34] gave him a key by which to discover the
[17:37] messengers for each age because if you
[17:39] think about it there were a lot of Great
[17:41] Men of God in every age there was great
[17:44] Ministries I mean even in Paul's day
[17:46] even though it's very clear by the
[17:48] scripture there were a lot of powerful
[17:50] Ministries it's very clear that Paul is
[17:52] is the messenger but you could look at
[17:54] it as a man and go well this ministry
[17:56] was just as powerful in this ministry
[17:58] and and down through the different ages
[18:00] there were always very powerful God
[18:03] called God anointed ministers but
[18:05] brother that Branham says I was given a
[18:08] key to by which I could tell and
[18:10] discover the messengers of the age and
[18:14] that key is the scripture that it's at
[18:16] the very core of everything we believe
[18:18] tonight as message Believers Jesus
[18:21] Christ the same yesterday today and
[18:25] forever he said it is the Revelation
[18:27] that God never changes and that his ways
[18:31] are as unchangeable as he is in other
[18:35] words what he did at the very very first
[18:37] he's going to keep doing all the way
[18:39] until the last time if he ever did it
[18:42] one way God Don't Make Mistakes so if he
[18:44] ever did it one way he's going to keep
[18:46] doing it until it is done for the last
[18:49] time and so what brother Branham
[18:50] realizes through Revelation is the kind
[18:53] of man that God chose in the very first
[18:56] age which is what we're studying the
[18:58] Ephesian age and how he operated and
[19:02] manifested through that Ministry
[19:04] he says will be how God does it in every
[19:07] age so once he receives who the
[19:09] messenger is in the first age and how
[19:12] God manifests himself in that messenger
[19:15] that's how God's going to operate in
[19:17] every messenger down through every age
[19:21] amen he says the word can't change or be
[19:26] changed because the word is God
[19:30] he says thus what the church was at
[19:33] Pentecost now look as you go through the
[19:35] church age book hopefully you're
[19:37] starting to recognize why we preach what
[19:39] we preach hopefully you're starting to
[19:41] see oh this isn't brother Tim's opinion
[19:43] or brother Aaron her brother Joe's
[19:45] opinion these things are coming right
[19:47] out of the message this is this is the
[19:50] message of the hour as you read this and
[19:52] and what you're going to find is I know
[19:54] even myself as I go through it is that a
[19:56] lot of the quotes that you hear every
[19:58] Sunday and every Wednesday come out of
[20:00] the church age book you're reading that
[20:02] you're going yep I've heard that before
[20:03] yep I've heard that before yep I've
[20:05] heard that before and that's all in here
[20:07] he says thus what the church was at
[20:09] Pentecost is the standard that's not a
[20:14] Tim Pruitt Doctrine
[20:15] all right we find that right here what
[20:17] the church was at Pentecost is the
[20:19] standard that is the pattern there is no
[20:24] other pattern no matter what the
[20:26] scholars say God has not changed that
[20:29] pattern what God did at Pentecost he has
[20:32] to keep on doing until the church age
[20:36] closes that's why we preach the New
[20:38] Birth the way we do church that's why we
[20:40] preach you have to be born again because
[20:43] if we preach anything else we're taken
[20:45] away from the pattern we have to preach
[20:48] it the way we preach it we can't take
[20:50] away from the word we're commanded in
[20:52] revelation 22 18. it says for I testify
[20:55] unto every man that heareth the words of
[20:57] the prophecy of this book If any man
[20:59] shall add unto these things God shall
[21:02] add unto him the plagues that are
[21:03] written in this book and if any man
[21:06] shall take away from the words of the
[21:07] book of this prophecy God shall take
[21:10] away his part out of the book of life
[21:12] and out of the holy city and from the
[21:15] things which are written in this book
[21:18] so in other words we have no choice but
[21:20] to preach it the exact same way it was
[21:23] preached on the day of Pentecost we have
[21:25] no choice but to preach it that way
[21:27] because if God ever did it that way he
[21:30] still does it that way today he says the
[21:34] promise of power which with the apostles
[21:37] were endowed at Pentecost is to you
[21:39] that's Jews and to your children that's
[21:42] Jews and to all that are far off
[21:45] Gentiles that's where we come into it to
[21:48] as many as the Lord Our God shall call
[21:51] both Jews and Gentiles and he says this
[21:54] until he stops calling the Pentecostal
[21:57] message and power will not cease
[22:02] let that settle in tonight because
[22:04] there's going to be people that tell you
[22:06] that's for a day gone by that's for
[22:08] another age brother Branham says the
[22:10] Pentecostal message and power will not
[22:14] cease so I can tell you tonight that he
[22:17] still heals the same way he still
[22:19] delivers the same way he still fills
[22:22] with the Holy Ghost the same way he
[22:24] still operates within the body the same
[22:27] way as he did at Pentecost because that
[22:30] is the standard amen he says you he he
[22:34] says what the church had at Pentecost is
[22:37] her inalienable right
[22:40] he says originally she had the pure word
[22:42] of God now a lot of people want to stop
[22:45] right there it's back to the word back
[22:47] to the word I couldn't agree more with
[22:49] you he says it was the pure word of God
[22:52] originally she he says she had the power
[22:55] of the spirit manifested in diverse
[22:58] times and wonders and Gifts of the Holy
[23:03] Ghost Church it is your right to have
[23:05] gifts operate in an evening like
[23:07] Tabernacle it is your right to have the
[23:10] spirit moving in our services those
[23:12] things that other people say well I'm
[23:13] not so sure about I don't know if we
[23:16] need that I'm telling you that it is
[23:17] your right to have those things it is
[23:19] your right to have an experience at the
[23:22] altar in your seat where the Holy Ghost
[23:24] sweeps down and fills your life and
[23:26] changes you forever it's not an option
[23:28] it's not something somebody can tell you
[23:30] you can't have it is your right and I'm
[23:33] telling you especially as Americans we
[23:35] ought to know what it's like to fight
[23:37] for our rights there's people telling
[23:39] you you don't have to have it that has
[23:40] gone by and I say we're not going to
[23:42] stand for it it's my right I'm going to
[23:44] fight for it Whatever It Takes listen
[23:46] you're going to come sometimes on a
[23:48] Wednesday or sometimes on a Sunday and
[23:50] it's not going to be easy
[23:51] but you're gonna have to fight for it I
[23:54] have a right to the spirit moving
[23:55] tonight I have a right to be touched by
[23:57] the Holy Ghost I have a right to be
[23:59] refilled tonight and it's something that
[24:01] you have to be willing to fight for amen
[24:05] I believe that we're a church that that
[24:07] has experienced it but I want to warn us
[24:09] not to take it for granted
[24:12] not to let it become common to you don't
[24:15] just let it be we're going to evening
[24:17] like Tabernacle again and maybe we'll
[24:19] have a good time you gotta it should be
[24:22] so precious to you it's something that
[24:24] you come and you want to fight for and
[24:26] and fight for it for for your generation
[24:29] other Generations have experienced it
[24:31] we've experienced it but will you
[24:34] continue to fight for it will you
[24:36] continue to stand for it to where we
[24:37] don't let it slip away because what
[24:40] we'll find as we go on is it's so easy
[24:42] to let these things slip away
[24:46] the pattern he says that is how it is
[24:50] done
[24:51] the true church will always try to be
[24:55] like the original
[24:57] at Pentecost
[25:00] he makes it to where it is an actual
[25:03] effort
[25:04] the true church will try
[25:08] to be like the original at Pentecost he
[25:13] says the true church of today will try
[25:15] to approximate that early first one
[25:19] so if you're putting off on those things
[25:21] and you don't want to see those things I
[25:24] would never say this but I say when I
[25:26] read that
[25:27] if you're not trying to be like that
[25:30] original Pentecost
[25:32] you're not the true church
[25:35] the true church will
[25:38] sometimes
[25:41] the true church will always
[25:45] try to be like the original at Pentecost
[25:48] now going a little further because we're
[25:50] getting now to talk about The Messengers
[25:52] he says and The Messengers to the
[25:54] churches having the same spirit of God
[25:57] in them will try to approximate
[26:00] the Apostle Paul now he tells us they
[26:03] won't be carbon copies they're not going
[26:05] to be somebody that's walking around
[26:07] just trying to imitate him but it's
[26:09] because it's the same spirit of God in
[26:12] them back to the church it's not that
[26:14] we're trying to manufacture why are we
[26:17] like the church at Pentecost because
[26:19] it's the same spirit that fell there and
[26:22] moved in that first age that's moving
[26:25] once again unhindered in this age
[26:28] he says
[26:33] all the Ministries are Mighty gifts in
[26:36] an age
[26:37] he looks through and he says all the all
[26:39] the different Ministries all the mighty
[26:40] gifts and age the Messenger will be the
[26:42] one most like Paul in other words it's
[26:46] not going to be a carbon copy but this
[26:48] is back to the key that he found how
[26:49] does he know which one which messenger
[26:52] which Ministry is the messenger and
[26:54] he'll look and he'll compare and the one
[26:57] that comes out most like Paul free from
[26:59] denomination
[27:01] um sold out pure word manifestations of
[27:04] the power of the Holy Spirit the mess
[27:06] the ministry that fits this mold is the
[27:09] one that's going to be the messenger of
[27:12] the age and he says as the light begets
[27:15] light the true church
[27:18] will always be the one that tries to
[27:21] follow in the steps of her Founders at
[27:23] Pentecost
[27:25] listen I've gotten to the point where
[27:27] it's not something that we have to
[27:28] debate with people anymore
[27:30] it's not up for argument it's just right
[27:34] there the true church will always be the
[27:37] one that tries to follow in the steps of
[27:39] her Founders at Pentecost and her
[27:41] Messengers will follow the Apostle Paul
[27:44] the first Messenger to the first age he
[27:47] says it's that simple
[27:49] and that wonderful
[27:52] and that's why it tells us that if the
[27:54] vine were to ever put forth another
[27:55] Branch it will write another book of
[27:58] Acts because it's just like the founders
[28:00] there at Pentecost we don't have to work
[28:03] it up nor should we ever
[28:07] we should never work something up
[28:10] our worship should be from the depths of
[28:13] sincerity if we come out of our seek to
[28:16] worship it's because there was something
[28:18] within us that we could no longer stay
[28:20] there it was something that that pulled
[28:22] us out bubbled us if we dance it
[28:24] shouldn't be just because everybody's
[28:26] dancing it's because something on the
[28:28] inside of you begins to dance and you
[28:30] can't contain yourself
[28:32] it's a true worship it's it's not a
[28:35] workup we don't have to work it up but
[28:38] if we see ourselves falling short of
[28:41] what they have
[28:43] if we look at what we are and compare it
[28:46] to what they are and we see that we
[28:48] don't measure up or that we're falling
[28:50] short
[28:51] to where how the spirit moved there it's
[28:53] not moving here we have to be willing to
[28:56] take account and say why
[28:58] we have to be willing to measure
[29:00] ourselves against the standard against
[29:02] the pattern every Church
[29:05] and maybe we won't be carbon copies
[29:08] but we have to be willing to put
[29:10] ourselves up against the the pattern and
[29:14] it's and it's important
[29:15] it's very important that we're able to
[29:18] recognize who the true church is and
[29:20] able to recognize the true word because
[29:23] there is a false
[29:26] that's going to be a theme as we go
[29:27] forward in in every Church age from this
[29:30] point forward there is a true church
[29:33] and there is a false there is a True
[29:35] Vine and there is a false and so it is
[29:39] important that we know what the pattern
[29:41] is
[29:42] that way we could compare that way we
[29:45] can determine what is the false Vine
[29:49] we know there's two Vines it tells us in
[29:51] Matthew 24 24 for there shall arise
[29:54] false Christ and false prophets and
[29:57] shall Grow Show great signs and wonders
[30:00] in so much that if it were possible they
[30:03] shall deceive the very elect
[30:08] now sometimes I can remember even as a
[30:10] kid and sometimes even in sermons how
[30:12] how this comes across almost as a scary
[30:15] scripture
[30:16] it comes across almost as a oh be
[30:19] careful it's so close
[30:21] be careful it's so close but I don't see
[30:25] it as a scary scripture at all this is
[30:27] one of the most uplifting scriptures
[30:29] that I can find anywhere in the Bible
[30:31] because it tells me that no matter what
[30:34] I will not be deceived no matter how bad
[30:38] things get no matter how difficult no
[30:40] matter the situation no matter the false
[30:42] doctrines no matter what I'm told no
[30:44] matter what people try to say the elect
[30:47] will not be deceived and tonight I did I
[30:51] identify as the elect I'm not going to
[30:53] put myself somewhere so I know I'm gonna
[30:55] make it I'm not going to be deceived my
[30:58] soul is not going to be led astray this
[31:00] is an uplifting and wonderful verse in
[31:03] the Bible you're gonna make it you're
[31:06] not gonna be deceived you're not going
[31:07] to fall short you are the elect God put
[31:10] that seed on the inside of you man
[31:12] didn't do it man can't take it away
[31:14] Satan didn't do it he has no right to it
[31:17] you are going to overcome because it's
[31:20] him his seed on the inside of you being
[31:23] drawn back to him
[31:25] he says there is a true church and a
[31:28] false Church there is a True Vine and a
[31:31] false Vine
[31:33] but of course that false Church false
[31:36] Vine body will always try to assert the
[31:39] position of the true church and contend
[31:42] that she and not the elect are the real
[31:46] and authentic the false will try to kill
[31:51] the truth
[31:52] the false has been trying to take that
[31:54] position and stomp out the True Vine
[31:57] from the very beginning you can find it
[31:58] right there in the Book of Genesis but
[32:00] I'd like to tell the devil we're still
[32:02] standing we're still here and he can try
[32:04] whatever but what I know is the elect
[32:06] shall not be deceived we see the two
[32:10] Vines throughout the scripture like I
[32:12] said even from the very beginning
[32:14] we see two trees in the garden
[32:17] one brings life and one brings death
[32:20] two children Cain and Abel both worship
[32:24] both bring sacrifices
[32:27] listen to this he says and the Lord had
[32:29] respect unto Abel unto his offering but
[32:32] unto Cain into his offering he had not
[32:34] respect
[32:36] now this is one thing
[32:38] and we'll deal with Cain and Abel a lot
[32:39] as we go forward in the church ages but
[32:41] just to hit on a point that we've
[32:43] already mentioned
[32:44] brother Branham says that Abel knew what
[32:47] to offer and what to sacrifice because
[32:49] of what does anybody know
[32:51] revelation
[32:53] we need Revelation Even in our worship
[32:58] we need Revelation in everything Cain is
[33:00] rejected here in this sense because he
[33:03] doesn't have the revelation
[33:06] God even tells him don't you know if
[33:08] you'll do what your brother in other
[33:10] words you did it wrong because you
[33:11] didn't have Revelation it is important
[33:14] that we seek Revelation brother Bradham
[33:16] says here one was the elect of God and
[33:19] the other was reprobate both worshiped
[33:23] God
[33:25] in every single case there was worship
[33:28] of God involved he's talking about the
[33:30] two Vines he's talking about the twins
[33:33] down through through the Bible the
[33:35] worship of God involved in every case
[33:37] the evil hated the righteous and
[33:40] persecuted the righteous in some cases
[33:43] the evil destroyed the righteous but
[33:45] notice they were planted together
[33:49] they lived together
[33:53] they both made claims upon God and
[33:56] worshiped God
[33:59] we see twins of Isaac and Rebecca Jacob
[34:02] and Esau
[34:03] let me tell you one way
[34:05] to tell the difference
[34:07] in the true and the false
[34:10] the true will never despise the
[34:12] birthright
[34:14] Esau despised the birthright but Jacob
[34:17] believed in the birthright let me tell
[34:19] you this ain't exactly the same angle
[34:21] but I'm gonna tell you this the true do
[34:23] not despise our inalienable right to
[34:25] Pentecost
[34:26] we do not despise those rights we
[34:28] believe in those rights and we fight for
[34:30] those rights but the Esau's just as they
[34:33] despise the birthright despise the fact
[34:35] that we stand for those rights that seed
[34:38] despise the fact that we still believe
[34:40] and fight for the for those rights in
[34:43] our lives
[34:44] but the vines are planted together they
[34:47] grow together
[34:49] and for many for a long time especially
[34:51] when they're young they look identical
[34:54] they can grow together and early on it's
[34:56] hard to tell the difference
[34:58] it's hard to tell
[35:00] you know I was having a conversation
[35:01] with the brother today about he was
[35:03] asking me about another brother and his
[35:06] testimony and I said
[35:08] I I don't know us I'm not inside the
[35:11] brother's heart
[35:12] I said in reality
[35:15] do any of us
[35:17] really know
[35:19] outside of us
[35:22] I I I know that y'all are wonderful
[35:24] people I know that you come to church I
[35:28] believe every one of you is going to be
[35:30] saved Ah that's how I choose to believe
[35:32] I don't ever believe to or preach to you
[35:35] like I think you're going to hell I
[35:37] believe but but but you are the only one
[35:39] that knows
[35:40] you're the only one
[35:42] only one you're ahead on your pill at
[35:43] night you may fool mommy and daddy you
[35:49] make you know exactly where you at and
[35:52] this kind of went sideways for just a
[35:54] second but let's stay there for just a
[35:55] second
[35:56] we're at that we're at the end time I
[35:58] know right now we're starting on the
[35:59] very first church age but this ain't
[36:01] where we're living we're living at the
[36:03] end of the end at the very end of
[36:05] laodicea and then I I was listening to a
[36:07] minister today saying people keep asking
[36:09] me what has to happen before God for
[36:12] Jesus can come back and he said
[36:14] absolutely nothing
[36:18] he said he can come back right now
[36:20] he can come back before this service is
[36:22] dismissed
[36:24] I don't believe any of your tears I
[36:27] believe you're all weak but what I'm
[36:29] saying is right now you know where
[36:30] you're at you know that if if Jesus were
[36:33] to come during this service whether or
[36:36] not you'd be sitting on the Pew when we
[36:38] were all gone or not
[36:40] hold that in your heart as we continue
[36:41] you know where you're at I believe
[36:44] you're wheat
[36:45] but you know where you're at in your
[36:46] relationship
[36:48] the wheat and the tares
[36:51] he says another Parable put he forth
[36:53] unto them saying the Kingdom of Heaven
[36:55] is likened into a man which sowed good
[36:57] seed in his field now remember what
[36:59] we're dealing with here we're talking
[37:00] about two Vines two seeds growing up
[37:02] together from the very beginning we saw
[37:05] it with Cain and Abel
[37:07] he says but while men slept
[37:10] well he says the Kingdom of Heaven is
[37:12] likened into a man which sowed good seed
[37:13] in his field but while men slept his
[37:15] enemy came and sow tears among the wheat
[37:18] and went his way but when the blade was
[37:22] sprung up and brought forth fruit then
[37:24] appeared the tares also
[37:28] notice God didn't plant the tears
[37:31] it says Satan planted those tares right
[37:33] Among The Good Seed of God the two kinds
[37:37] of plants and in parentheses brother
[37:38] Branham says people
[37:42] two kinds of plants people
[37:44] from two different seeds grew up
[37:48] together and I just want to emphasize
[37:49] again this is something that we're going
[37:51] to study more and more as we go down
[37:53] through the church ages the two seeds
[37:55] side by side growing up together the
[37:58] true church and the Falls Church are
[38:01] intertwined
[38:02] especially early on as it comes to
[38:06] maturity the differences become more and
[38:08] more plain but early on it's so
[38:10] intertwined it's hard to tell one from
[38:12] the other which is true which is false
[38:14] planted together
[38:17] but of different seeds
[38:20] we turn now and began to look at how is
[38:22] it that God began to deal
[38:24] with the Gentiles we know that that
[38:27] God's chosen people all down through the
[38:29] Bible were the Jews and at some point
[38:32] though it turns to the Gentiles as he
[38:36] begins looking into the church ages
[38:38] the seven churches that we deal with are
[38:40] all in Asia Minor and he does not speak
[38:43] there's another church there's many
[38:45] other churches but the biggest major
[38:47] church is in Jerusalem
[38:49] but the reason he doesn't speak to that
[38:52] church is because it's made up mostly of
[38:55] Jews and at this point the gospel has
[38:58] turned from the Jews and it has turned
[39:00] to the Gentiles so the church there at
[39:02] Jerusalem isn't even addressed
[39:05] he says the reason for this is that God
[39:08] has turned from the Jews to the Gentiles
[39:10] thus the whole of the church ages the
[39:14] entire book of the church is that from
[39:16] from when it starts all the way till now
[39:19] God is dealing with the Gentiles and
[39:23] calling out a gentile Bride for himself
[39:26] that is something that we can rejoice in
[39:28] because had he not turned from the Jews
[39:31] had he not turned to us what chance
[39:33] would we have but he said I'm going to
[39:35] have a gentile Bride for my name's sake
[39:38] and I'm so thankful that he called my
[39:40] name I'm so thankful that he called your
[39:42] name
[39:43] he says that makes the church ages and
[39:47] the term the fullness of the Gentiles
[39:49] one and the same thing so these ages and
[39:54] these churches that we're talking about
[39:55] these are Gentile churches
[39:59] acts 13 and 45 says but when the Jews
[40:02] saw the multitudes they were filled with
[40:05] Envy so the Jews see the multitudes of
[40:07] of Gentiles and they're filled with envy
[40:10] and spake against those things which
[40:12] were spoken by Paul
[40:14] contradicting and blaspheming then Paul
[40:17] and Barnabas wax bold and said it was
[40:20] necessary that the word of God should
[40:23] have first been spoken to you he's
[40:25] talking to the Jews first been spoken to
[40:28] you
[40:29] but seeing you put it from you and judge
[40:33] yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life
[40:36] Lo we turn to the Gentiles in other
[40:39] words the Jews had opportunity at it
[40:41] Jesus came to the Jews the word himself
[40:45] made flesh came to the Jews and they
[40:47] crucified it and he says you didn't want
[40:49] it so now we're going to give others an
[40:52] opportunity I'm so thankful tonight
[40:53] listen others may want to throw this
[40:55] aside others may not want the message of
[40:57] the eye where others may not want the
[40:59] Holy Ghost I say I'll take it I'm so
[41:01] thankful I have the opportunity at it
[41:03] when others turn it down God doesn't
[41:05] just give up he doesn't just say oh well
[41:08] I guess anywhere he said I'll find
[41:09] somebody somebody will accept it
[41:11] somebody will take this word somebody
[41:13] will be born again
[41:15] verse 47 he says for so hath the Lord
[41:18] commanded us saying I have set thee to
[41:22] be a light of the Gentiles that thou
[41:24] shouldest be for salvation unto the ends
[41:27] of the Earth and when the Gentiles heard
[41:29] this they were glad that's us when the
[41:31] Gentiles heard this they were glad come
[41:34] on somebody we got to get glad tonight
[41:35] about this and glorify the word of the
[41:39] Lord and as many as were ordained to
[41:42] eternal life believed so the gospel has
[41:46] turned to the Gentiles and these are the
[41:48] Gentile
[41:49] Church ages
[41:52] brother Branham teaches us about the
[41:54] characteristics of the ages and he says
[41:57] here at these seven churches located in
[41:59] Asia Minor contained certain
[42:03] characteristics within them at that
[42:06] ancient date which became mature fruit
[42:09] of later ages so these characteristics
[42:12] if it becomes mature fruit later we can
[42:15] conclude that these characteristics are
[42:17] seeds
[42:18] they are seeds that are become mature
[42:21] fruit later they were just little things
[42:23] maybe hard for most historians maybe
[42:26] didn't pick it up most of us as we read
[42:28] through maybe didn't pick it up but a
[42:30] prophet seeking Revelation reads these
[42:33] things and he sees these little seeds
[42:34] and he recognized what these
[42:36] characteristics are and what it's going
[42:38] to become so these little things these
[42:41] little seeds these little
[42:42] characteristics they're so small but
[42:45] hundreds and even thousands of years
[42:46] later when that age
[42:48] that that church had represented comes
[42:51] into fruition then those seeds become
[42:54] manifested as fruits of that age the
[42:58] seeds in other words would come to
[43:00] harvest
[43:03] we know and brother Brown tells us that
[43:05] the messenger of the Ephesian age that
[43:07] we're studying is the Apostle Paul
[43:10] he says Paul founded the church at
[43:13] Ephesus about the middle of the first
[43:14] century this enables us to set the date
[43:18] of the beginning of the Ephesian Church
[43:20] age about 53 A.D
[43:24] he says he was the prophet Messenger to
[43:27] the Gentiles his prophetic office by
[43:29] which he received the full revelation of
[43:31] the word for the Gentiles authenticated
[43:34] him as the apostolic messenger
[43:39] and just as we said that the the first
[43:41] age was the pattern or Pentecost was the
[43:45] pattern for all other ages so was Paul
[43:46] the the first messenger the pattern for
[43:49] all other Messengers but it goes beyond
[43:51] that brother Branham says that Paul is
[43:54] the pattern for every God called
[43:57] Minister he says every God called
[44:01] Minister should be patterned after Paul
[44:05] amen so we're looking here at Paul and
[44:07] if we're going to pattern after Paul if
[44:09] we should know what a god-called
[44:11] Ministry is like we're going to look at
[44:13] what Paul's was like and he says Paul's
[44:16] Ministry had a three-fold quality he
[44:19] says first he was true to the word he
[44:23] was not tied to organization not sent by
[44:26] the Council of Jerusalem not afraid to
[44:29] stand up to the religious leaders and as
[44:31] I read that I say you could have just
[44:34] easily described brother Branham right
[44:36] there he wasn't afraid to stand up to
[44:38] the organizations of the day he didn't
[44:40] matter if it cost him we heard the other
[44:42] day how how he was offered one and a
[44:44] half million dollars one time for one
[44:46] healing think about the kingdom he could
[44:49] have had
[44:50] think about the money he could have had
[44:52] the planes the Jets the churches and yet
[44:54] he lived a humble life why because he
[44:56] was A God Called Ministry amen Galatians
[45:00] 1 and 8 describe this is Paul now says
[45:03] but though we are an angel from heaven
[45:06] preach any other gospel unto you then
[45:08] that which we have preached unto you let
[45:11] him be accursed I'd say he wasn't afraid
[45:14] to stand up to other people he says not
[45:16] only is what I'm telling you the truth
[45:18] if you preach anything different you're
[45:20] going to be accursed
[45:21] that's why we got to preach it just like
[45:24] it was at Pentecost I ain't trying to be
[45:26] accursed
[45:28] I'm going to preach it just like they
[45:30] preached it in the first stage I don't
[45:31] care what you can show me what you
[45:33] think's a better idea he said preach it
[45:36] like I preached it exactly like I did
[45:39] first Corinthians 14 36 says what came
[45:42] the word of God out from you now these
[45:45] people are challenging Paul
[45:46] and so I don't know in terms maybe young
[45:50] people might understand he's almost
[45:51] talking trash to him a little bit
[45:53] he's like oh what are you the messenger
[45:55] no I didn't think so
[45:57] I'm the messenger
[45:59] he says what did the word of God come
[46:01] out from you or came it unto you only if
[46:04] any man think himself to be a prophet or
[46:06] spiritual let him acknowledge that the
[46:08] things that I write unto you are the
[46:10] Commandments of the Lord he was bold
[46:13] sometimes we listen to to brother
[46:15] Bradham because it's something we
[46:16] understand it's more in our language
[46:18] it's not old English and sometimes we're
[46:20] like ouch that was harsh
[46:22] ouch that was bold and Paul's standing
[46:25] in here telling people y'all shut up and
[46:26] sit down I'm telling I'm laying it down
[46:28] here you just agree with me or be
[46:30] accursed
[46:31] you talk about boldness
[46:33] Galatians 1 1 Paul an apostle not of men
[46:37] neither by man but by Jesus Christ and
[46:40] God the Father who raised him from the
[46:43] dead in other words I am an apostle I am
[46:46] telling you I'm an apostle he wasn't
[46:49] afraid to stand up he wasn't tied to
[46:52] organization or the council at Jerusalem
[46:55] second
[46:57] his ministry was in the power of the
[47:01] spirit
[47:03] when Ministry is in the power of the
[47:05] spirit it brings about a demonstration
[47:08] and not just a telling
[47:11] now hear that when a Ministry has the
[47:13] power of the spirit it doesn't just tell
[47:15] you about things but there is a
[47:17] demonstration remember it is the pattern
[47:20] of all true ministers
[47:23] his ministry was in the power of the
[47:25] spirit acts 14 Lamer healed Acts 20 the
[47:27] dead are raised acts 28 all diseases are
[47:30] healed
[47:31] second Corinthians 12 12 says truly the
[47:34] signs of an apostle were wrought among
[47:36] you in all patients in signs and wonders
[47:40] and mighty deeds and this is the pattern
[47:43] of all God called Ministry
[47:47] so how then will a Ministry stand up and
[47:51] say these things are no longer needed or
[47:53] no longer applicable
[47:56] you are disqualifying yourself
[48:00] I don't have to do it you're doing it
[48:03] you're going
[48:04] me right here
[48:05] I'm not God called
[48:09] you're doing it yourself
[48:12] when you lay these things aside First
[48:14] Corinthians 2 1-5 and I Brethren when I
[48:17] came unto you came not with Excellency
[48:20] of speech or of wisdom
[48:23] declaring unto you the testimony of God
[48:25] for I am determined not to know anything
[48:28] among you in other words he's not there
[48:29] to try to blow your mind with fancy
[48:31] words and fancy doctrines and and make
[48:33] things sound right and just fit just
[48:35] perfect he says save Jesus Christ and
[48:38] him crucified I was with you in weakness
[48:40] and in fear and in much trembling and my
[48:43] in my speech and my preaching was not
[48:46] with enticing words of man's Wisdom but
[48:48] in demonstration of the spirit and power
[48:52] that your face should not stand in the
[48:55] wisdom of man but in the power of God
[48:59] this is the pattern
[49:02] this is the pattern why do you all
[49:05] preach on this so much why do you harp
[49:07] on this so much we're not we're just
[49:09] lining up to the pattern we're just
[49:12] doing exactly what Paul said to do what
[49:15] the word said to do amen
[49:19] and finally
[49:20] evident fruits
[49:25] First Corinthians 9 and 1. am I not an
[49:28] apostle
[49:29] Here We Go Again think of all the things
[49:31] that has happened in his ministry
[49:35] am I not an apostle
[49:38] am I not free have I not seen Jesus
[49:41] Christ Our Lord
[49:43] are not ye my work in the Lord
[49:47] if I be not an apostle unto others yet
[49:50] doubtless I am to you for the Seal of
[49:54] mine apostleship are ye
[49:57] in the Lord
[49:59] now what I want you to understand from
[50:00] this real quick young people is
[50:02] it is not uncommon
[50:06] for the messenger of the age
[50:10] to come under attack
[50:13] oh but they're saying this about brother
[50:15] Brown and and they found this and they
[50:17] said this right here and they said and
[50:19] half the scriptures I've read as Paul
[50:21] having to defend himself
[50:23] because people are attacking him and
[50:25] saying he's false
[50:26] that ain't real he's not really that
[50:28] he's not really a messenger he's not
[50:30] really an apostle
[50:32] and he's constantly coming under attack
[50:34] he's under reproached false Brethren or
[50:36] questioning his apostleship
[50:39] says and we're very industrious to
[50:41] lessen his character and sink his
[50:43] reputation particularly here at Corinth
[50:46] a place to which he had been
[50:48] instrumental in doing so much good
[50:51] some among the Corinthians questioned if
[50:54] they did not disown his apostolical
[50:57] character
[50:58] here at Corinth where he's done so much
[51:00] they've seen so much and they're trying
[51:02] to ruin him
[51:03] they're trying to to disown him and
[51:06] trying to ruin his character
[51:08] and he says am I not an apostle
[51:11] am I not free
[51:13] he says it was Paul's Ministry to that
[51:15] age that was preparing these people to
[51:18] be presented to Christ it was by his
[51:21] ministry that so many Gentiles had come
[51:23] to know the Lord and been added to the
[51:26] kingdom he's saying
[51:28] are you not my work in the Lord
[51:32] he says the Seal of my apostleship is
[51:35] that you even know the Lord
[51:38] and here they are attacking don't think
[51:40] it's strange when people attack the
[51:41] messenger of this day
[51:43] it's what's been happening it's the
[51:45] pattern from the very first age they're
[51:48] always finding something wrong they're
[51:50] always finding something to point to
[51:52] but these converts here that he's
[51:55] pointing to are the evident fruit he's
[51:57] saying
[51:58] you are
[52:01] the Seal of my apostleship fruits
[52:04] of his ministry he said Paul had been
[52:06] the means of bringing in multitudes of
[52:09] the Gentile sheep he fed them and cared
[52:12] for them until they brought forth
[52:14] righteous fruit and were prepared to
[52:16] meet the Lord as a part
[52:18] of the Gentile bride
[52:22] then we get to this city of Ephesus
[52:24] there's actually some very
[52:27] um very neat looking for lack of better
[52:30] word ruins that are left behind at the
[52:31] city of Ephesus these are just a couple
[52:34] small pictures and it was it was
[52:36] considered one of the greatest cities of
[52:38] all of Asia all of Asia full of wealth
[52:41] full of influence
[52:43] very prominent in the early church it
[52:45] was I actually often referred to as the
[52:48] third city of the Christian faith with
[52:51] the first being Jerusalem the the second
[52:54] being Antioch and then the third being
[52:56] Ephesus Paul would actually Pastor here
[52:59] for three years he spent three years of
[53:01] his life pastoring here at Ephesus and
[53:04] now as we get into this some of the
[53:05] things that that we know
[53:07] but things that we need to take to heart
[53:09] because this age
[53:11] is the age that mirrors our age in so
[53:13] many ways
[53:16] the meaning of Ephesus is aimed at
[53:19] and relaxed
[53:21] he says the high and aspirations of this
[53:25] age that had begun with the fullness of
[53:27] the spirit the depth of God whereby they
[53:30] were aiming at the High Calling of God
[53:32] began to give way to a less watchful
[53:37] attitude
[53:39] remember young people this is the age of
[53:42] the upper room
[53:43] we talk about this all the time oh Upper
[53:45] Room experience Upper Room experience
[53:47] The Upper Room the the apostles and here
[53:50] this is the age of Paul Peter Stephen
[53:52] and they're beginning to drift no not
[53:55] Paul Peter and Stephen but the age that
[53:57] they were in
[53:59] the age that they were in slowly it
[54:01] begins to drift and we can never let
[54:04] that be our testimony
[54:06] never let that be your Testament where
[54:07] are you at tonight
[54:10] where are you at in your experience or
[54:11] are you still there with the same fire
[54:13] that you had when you met the Lord do
[54:16] you have the same fire right now as you
[54:18] had on say Saturday night at Youth Camp
[54:20] let's just go back that far
[54:23] is that the same firefits if it's not
[54:26] it's time to check up right now don't
[54:28] slide too far don't relax too much too
[54:31] many times we drift too far and relax
[54:33] too much and then we got a war to get
[54:35] back through to get to where we were but
[54:37] if we'll be willing to admit tonight
[54:39] maybe I've taken a step in the wrong
[54:41] direction maybe I've slid a little bit
[54:43] maybe I'm not where I'm supposed to be
[54:44] maybe it's not burning in me right now
[54:46] like it was when I was in that prayer
[54:48] line
[54:49] come on Church you can't live in a
[54:51] prayer line
[54:53] you know I'm all for it but it's time
[54:55] that we take some of the fire and some
[54:57] of the things we get in those services
[54:58] and it goes with us on Monday and
[55:00] Tuesday and Wednesday and do it all the
[55:03] way through a calendar year it's time to
[55:05] that it's not just that you can't
[55:06] experience or an altar experience you
[55:09] know I love those things but it's time
[55:11] to take those things into every day
[55:13] overcoming life
[55:15] where are you at
[55:17] this age was aimed at
[55:19] and relaxed they had so much fervor
[55:23] listen this youth group
[55:25] this youth group has been one of the
[55:27] most
[55:28] full of fervor and fire youth groups
[55:31] we've ever had
[55:32] you have set this church on fire you
[55:34] have turned it on its ear
[55:36] we love you but there is no age that was
[55:40] on fire like Ephesus
[55:42] there was no age that experienced things
[55:45] like the upper room
[55:47] but things began to slip in
[55:51] what will be the testimony of this youth
[55:53] group five years from tonight
[55:57] what will be the testimony of this youth
[56:00] group 10 years from tonight
[56:05] because that's what happens when little
[56:07] things begin to come in
[56:09] I'm not even talking about you're going
[56:11] out into full-blown sin or leaving the
[56:13] church I'm talking about the little
[56:13] things
[56:15] the little seeds that eventually have a
[56:17] harvest
[56:20] things began to slip in
[56:22] little ideas
[56:24] listen you got to guard the door
[56:27] guard the door of your heart guard the
[56:29] door of your mind guard the door of your
[56:31] eyes those things are seeds that will
[56:34] have a harvest you feed on the things of
[56:37] Hollywood long enough
[56:39] your mind begins to think I was just
[56:41] talking to this lady that cuts my hair
[56:43] the other day and she was talking about
[56:45] how things have gotten so crazy and she
[56:47] said it's so crazy because things have
[56:48] become normal that just 10 years ago
[56:50] were insane
[56:53] and the thing is that first time you
[56:55] watch something you shouldn't you know
[56:57] you shouldn't and it's almost hard to
[56:59] get through it but then the next time
[57:01] you do something you're not supposed to
[57:03] it gets a little easier
[57:05] and the next time it gets a little
[57:06] easier
[57:08] you use those words you shouldn't use
[57:10] and say things you shouldn't say and at
[57:12] first you know but after a while it gets
[57:14] easier and easier to wear the things
[57:15] that 10 years ago you would have never
[57:17] done become normal
[57:21] guard the door
[57:23] don't let the little things in because
[57:26] it was in these little things that the
[57:27] Antichrist came in shapeless
[57:30] not fully manifested not openly but in
[57:33] small seeds and attitudes
[57:37] we talked about how
[57:40] each City had characteristics
[57:43] characteristics that that would show how
[57:45] the age would go we spoke about the
[57:48] characteristics of the city and how they
[57:50] were seeds and how they foreshadowed a
[57:52] later Harvest
[57:53] so brother Branham goes into great
[57:55] detail breaking down how the Pagan
[57:57] worship at the Temple of Diana
[57:59] symbolized and showed forth what would
[58:01] happen in the age
[58:03] so we kind of got this in stages the the
[58:05] priest of the Temple of Diana were
[58:07] eunuchs
[58:09] they were incapable of reproducing life
[58:13] and brother Branham says this symbolized
[58:15] how when you get away from the word you
[58:17] begin to drift from the word that you
[58:19] have become barren
[58:23] he says that he says there was virgin
[58:24] Priestess who performed the religious
[58:27] Acts
[58:28] of the temple he says this showed forth
[58:30] the day that ceremony and form and
[58:34] ritual and works would take the place of
[58:36] the Holy Spirit and no longer would
[58:39] charismatic manifestations fill the
[58:43] temple of God
[58:46] we are to want charismatic
[58:48] manifestations to fill the temple of God
[58:52] he said this is just a sign he says when
[58:55] you depart from the word going back to
[58:58] the eunuchs you depart from life when
[59:01] you depart from the word many times we
[59:04] find we find it to where when it's when
[59:06] it's all about the lip Services word
[59:09] word word word word and how long has it
[59:12] been since you had a baptism or somebody
[59:13] born again or some when you depart from
[59:15] the word you depart from new births you
[59:18] depart from Life coming out
[59:21] Beyond this he says the high priest was
[59:23] a man of political power
[59:26] and although not fully manifested yet
[59:28] this showed that the church very soon
[59:29] would no longer be under the leadership
[59:31] of the Holy Ghost but would soon be
[59:34] ruled over and led by man
[59:37] and then there were Temple slaves
[59:41] no choice but to do exactly what they're
[59:43] told
[59:45] and that's okay if you're a slave to the
[59:46] Holy Spirit
[59:48] but these weren't slaves to that these
[59:49] were slaves to man
[59:51] and what this represented was the laity
[59:54] the people in the congregation
[59:57] no longer having a say but being ruled
[59:59] over by a clergy no longer served by the
[1:00:03] church
[1:00:04] but serving the church no longer led by
[1:00:08] the spirit but the laity were Bound by
[1:00:10] Creeds Bound by tradition and in so
[1:00:12] doing it bound up their worship
[1:00:16] what started
[1:00:18] as the age of the upper room aimed at
[1:00:21] higher high aspirations we're going to
[1:00:24] take a Rapture those of us who are alive
[1:00:26] and remain
[1:00:28] aimed at
[1:00:30] and relaxed
[1:00:31] and the next step slaves
[1:00:35] slaves to Creed slaves to Dogma slaves
[1:00:38] to denomination no life no freedom
[1:00:42] aimed at But realize Church we've been
[1:00:44] set free
[1:00:46] young person if you've ever been set
[1:00:48] free from an addiction or you've ever
[1:00:49] been set free from a spirit or you've
[1:00:51] ever had an experience with God don't
[1:00:53] ever go back to the slavery that you
[1:00:55] were set free from listen we've come to
[1:00:57] a place where we've been pulled out of
[1:00:59] denominations as a church and we're no
[1:01:01] longer bound by that don't don't ever
[1:01:03] allow our worship and our thinking to go
[1:01:05] back into a denominational box don't
[1:01:08] ever allow yourself to go back beyond
[1:01:10] your last experience that's why we say
[1:01:11] drive down a stake
[1:01:14] listen I was I was telling somebody the
[1:01:15] other day
[1:01:16] there are times I know where young
[1:01:18] people haven't experience
[1:01:21] and they feel like in their testimony is
[1:01:23] I got it I got it
[1:01:25] but then somewhere along the way they
[1:01:27] realize they might not have got what
[1:01:29] they thought they'd got
[1:01:32] and the devil says see you didn't get
[1:01:34] nothing that is a lie
[1:01:38] that is a lie maybe you didn't get what
[1:01:40] you thought you got but don't ever let
[1:01:43] him Rob from you the fact that you had
[1:01:45] an experience that God did something
[1:01:47] from you don't go back beyond that point
[1:01:50] say okay maybe that wasn't it but I'm
[1:01:52] gonna build on this experience and I'm
[1:01:54] going to go from experience to
[1:01:56] experience to experience never go back
[1:01:59] Beyond or behind the last place God met
[1:02:02] you don't ever let him talk you out of
[1:02:04] something that God did for you maybe
[1:02:06] just because you didn't get what you
[1:02:08] thought you did maybe you stumbled maybe
[1:02:11] you're like you know for sure I couldn't
[1:02:13] have got it that's fine but don't let
[1:02:15] him say see it was just emotion
[1:02:17] see it was nothing no God did something
[1:02:19] for you now build on what God did take
[1:02:22] another step seek more of God and grow
[1:02:25] and grow more and more and mature and
[1:02:28] quit backing off what God has done for
[1:02:30] you in your life
[1:02:33] don't ever relax
[1:02:38] Revelation 2 and 1.
[1:02:41] the heading here was Jesus in the church
[1:02:43] ages
[1:02:45] it says these things saith he that
[1:02:47] holdeth the Seven Stars in his right
[1:02:49] hand
[1:02:50] who walketh in the midst
[1:02:53] of the seven golden candlesticks now if
[1:02:55] you'll remember we talked about what the
[1:02:57] seven golden candlesticks were they were
[1:03:00] the seven churches
[1:03:02] and so that's why this scripture here is
[1:03:03] so important because once again it shows
[1:03:05] us that he will never leave us and never
[1:03:08] forsake us it didn't show him in the
[1:03:09] midst of the first three candlesticks it
[1:03:12] didn't show him in the first couple of
[1:03:14] churches it shows him in the midst of
[1:03:17] the seven golden candlesticks in other
[1:03:20] words he's still here tonight he's still
[1:03:22] moving he hasn't left us he hasn't
[1:03:24] forsaken us it may be getting dark we
[1:03:26] may be in the seventh Church age but the
[1:03:29] scripture plainly shows him in the midst
[1:03:31] of the seven golden candlesticks you
[1:03:33] don't have to be afraid tonight he's
[1:03:35] still here he's still moving the god of
[1:03:37] Miracles you don't have to look back to
[1:03:39] find the god of Miracles I'm telling you
[1:03:41] the god of Miracles is still here
[1:03:43] tonight the god that heals is still here
[1:03:45] tonight the god that will save you and
[1:03:47] fill you with the baptism of the Holy
[1:03:49] Ghost you don't got to look back he's
[1:03:51] still here tonight we see him in the
[1:03:53] word walking in the midst of the seven
[1:03:55] golden candlesticks
[1:03:58] what he was in the first age he is in
[1:04:02] all ages because he is in the midst and
[1:04:05] it's not and notice it's not him and
[1:04:07] somebody
[1:04:08] it's not Jesus and the Pope
[1:04:11] it's not Jesus and a preacher
[1:04:14] it's not even Jesus and a word prophet
[1:04:18] it's Jesus
[1:04:20] he alone died for you he alone can save
[1:04:22] you he alone deserves your worship
[1:04:24] listen after what he's done for you and
[1:04:27] he's fought for you and he's still
[1:04:28] standing you for this age how dare us
[1:04:30] give our worship to some movie star
[1:04:32] how dare us give our worship to some
[1:04:35] ball star or something like that listen
[1:04:36] I'm not against that you want a love
[1:04:38] ball I've always loved Ball but that
[1:04:40] ain't where our worship goes that ain't
[1:04:42] where our heart goes that ain't where
[1:04:43] our desires and our affections go our
[1:04:46] desires and our affections are to him
[1:04:47] he's the one standing for us in the last
[1:04:50] day he's the one still fighting for you
[1:04:52] he's the one pulling on your heart
[1:04:54] tonight because he's not back in Ephesus
[1:04:56] he's not back at Azusa Street he's here
[1:04:59] right now in the midst of the church
[1:05:02] he alone deserves Our Praise
[1:05:07] Seven Stars in his right hand we covered
[1:05:09] some of this before but we know that
[1:05:11] these are the seven Messengers
[1:05:15] but showing that he they're in his right
[1:05:18] hand
[1:05:19] is showing a symbol of power
[1:05:22] and Authority the very power and
[1:05:25] authority of God are with the messengers
[1:05:28] of each age
[1:05:30] I believe that we can say that we have
[1:05:33] witnessed that in in this generation
[1:05:35] we can hear it on tape as night after
[1:05:37] night
[1:05:39] the messenger would come forth and not
[1:05:41] make himself known but he would make God
[1:05:43] known to the people night after night he
[1:05:46] didn't build something for himself but
[1:05:48] he pointed people back to Christ he
[1:05:50] pointed to you that Jesus is the same
[1:05:52] yesterday today and forever he pointed
[1:05:54] to you that Jesus is a living God he
[1:05:56] pointed to you that Jesus is coming
[1:05:58] again he moved in the power and the
[1:06:01] authority of the Lord Jesus Christ he
[1:06:04] held out the word of Truth and God came
[1:06:06] night after night and backed it up
[1:06:08] that's the same thing that happens here
[1:06:11] it's the same thing that happens in all
[1:06:13] God called Ministries they hold forth
[1:06:15] the truth and God comes behind it and
[1:06:17] backs it up why do miracles happen why
[1:06:20] do these things happen God's coming down
[1:06:22] behind the truth and backing it up
[1:06:23] saying that's true what they said is
[1:06:26] true this is the truth I'm still alive
[1:06:28] I'm still here I'm still in the midst of
[1:06:31] the churches and he still moves that way
[1:06:34] we don't have to look back
[1:06:36] he's still here he's here now and in
[1:06:39] this very hour he's walking in the midst
[1:06:42] of the last ages golden candlestick
[1:06:45] he says what he was as he walked in the
[1:06:48] first age he is even now in this last
[1:06:51] stage Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:06:55] today
[1:06:57] and forever I'm so grateful for that
[1:06:59] don't ever let that become a slogan
[1:07:03] you know there's many times
[1:07:07] as many times that we don't understand
[1:07:08] how things turn out
[1:07:10] you know there's many times that we
[1:07:11] maybe we pray for people and they go by
[1:07:13] the way of the grave
[1:07:16] but I was just thinking this was just on
[1:07:17] my heart the other day I said you know
[1:07:18] we believe
[1:07:20] for so much more than other people
[1:07:23] believe for
[1:07:25] we believe so far beyond for things that
[1:07:28] other people don't even
[1:07:30] attempt to believe for
[1:07:32] and I said sometimes in that
[1:07:34] now we're never disappointed we're never
[1:07:36] left ashamed we've heard that we're
[1:07:38] never ashamed to be Believers but
[1:07:41] sometimes in that people you pray for go
[1:07:43] by the way of the Grave or people you
[1:07:45] pray for but but I said
[1:07:47] look at all the things we get because of
[1:07:50] the things we believe for sometimes we
[1:07:52] look at the well this one died and that
[1:07:54] one died I want to say but look at this
[1:07:56] one that was healed and look at this
[1:07:57] when that was saved and this one that if
[1:07:59] we hadn't held on for if we hadn't
[1:08:01] believed four but he's the same
[1:08:03] yesterday today and forever I still
[1:08:05] believe brother Brown said if I pray for
[1:08:07] ten thousand a day and they die tonight
[1:08:09] I'll pray for ten thousand tomorrow
[1:08:11] because it's his word he's the Healer he
[1:08:14] is the same and I say that we have not
[1:08:16] been left ashamed because of our
[1:08:18] testimony we have not been left ashamed
[1:08:20] because of what we believe for but we
[1:08:22] have gained great rewards because of
[1:08:24] what we have stood for in this day
[1:08:26] I say it's worth standing for though
[1:08:29] there's disappointments along the way
[1:08:30] you don't think there's disappointments
[1:08:32] for people that don't believe
[1:08:34] but think of the things we've won
[1:08:35] because of the high calling and the
[1:08:37] things we hold on to I believe it's
[1:08:39] worth it
[1:08:41] the seven golden candlesticks
[1:08:45] are to be made of pure gold
[1:08:47] we're likened here
[1:08:49] to pure gold
[1:08:51] I know sometimes we don't feel like pure
[1:08:53] gold
[1:08:54] but it's because
[1:08:56] our attributes
[1:08:58] are his attributes
[1:09:00] they're they're credited to us because
[1:09:03] our identity is found in him
[1:09:05] so we're found to be pure gold
[1:09:09] says in fact in her is summed up and
[1:09:12] manifested the Eternal wisdom and
[1:09:13] purpose of God I want you to hear that
[1:09:15] again because it's talking about you the
[1:09:17] next time you don't feel like you're
[1:09:19] very much you feel like a failure and
[1:09:20] you don't know which way to turn which
[1:09:21] way to go he says in fact in her is
[1:09:24] summed up and manifested the Eternal
[1:09:27] wisdom and purpose of God how can one
[1:09:31] fathom it how can one understand it
[1:09:33] though we cannot do that we can accept
[1:09:35] it by faith for God has spoken it I
[1:09:39] accept it tonight I accept what the word
[1:09:41] said about me tonight
[1:09:44] not only are we gold but according to
[1:09:46] Exodus 25 it says
[1:09:48] and thou shalt make a Candlestick of
[1:09:50] pure gold
[1:09:51] of beaten work shall the Candlestick be
[1:09:54] made uh oh
[1:09:56] these candlesticks are made by people
[1:09:58] taking the gold and they beat it
[1:10:01] and they beat it and it gets burned and
[1:10:03] they beat it till it gets all the draws
[1:10:05] out it's not going to be easy thing they
[1:10:07] don't just take a block of gold and all
[1:10:09] of a sudden it's a candlestick
[1:10:10] no it says it's a beaten work
[1:10:13] what is it this church has been hunted
[1:10:15] this church has been persecuted people
[1:10:18] have been in this bride have been killed
[1:10:20] and murdered down Through the Ages by
[1:10:22] the millions beaten and molded and made
[1:10:27] and as gold is malleable brother Branham
[1:10:29] says whereas brass will break with the
[1:10:31] beating this gold of God will bear her
[1:10:34] suffering for the Lord not bowed not
[1:10:36] broken not destroyed but formed as a
[1:10:39] thing of beauty and a joy Forever by the
[1:10:42] trials and testings of this life listen
[1:10:44] to me
[1:10:46] you're going to get knocked down in life
[1:10:50] let's be real you probably haven't
[1:10:52] experienced hardly any of the
[1:10:55] disappointments and hardships of life
[1:10:56] that you're going to experience
[1:10:58] and Satan tells you I'm going to break
[1:11:00] you you're not going to make it make it
[1:11:02] and God's saying all the time you're
[1:11:03] just molding them you're just making
[1:11:05] them into the golden lampstands that you
[1:11:07] can't you can't break these young people
[1:11:09] you can't break this bride because
[1:11:10] they're not made of brass they're not
[1:11:12] going to break but they're malleable
[1:11:13] they're filled with the Holy Ghost they
[1:11:15] know who their God is and they they're
[1:11:17] going to stand and they're going to be
[1:11:18] made and they're going to be molded not
[1:11:20] broken take that in mind the next trial
[1:11:23] you get hit with no I know it's not easy
[1:11:25] to celebrate in a trial but if you can
[1:11:26] find purpose in the trial if you can
[1:11:30] recognize this is a molding this is a
[1:11:32] making then it makes it easier for you
[1:11:34] to get through that trial when you find
[1:11:36] purpose in it
[1:11:37] Revelations 2 2-3 Christ Praises his own
[1:11:42] we're going to start to bring this to an
[1:11:44] end as we're getting closer to the end
[1:11:45] here it says I Know Thy works
[1:11:50] and I labor and thy patience and how
[1:11:53] thou can'tst not bear them which are
[1:11:54] evil and thou has tried them which say
[1:11:57] they are Apostles and are not and has
[1:12:00] found them liars and has borne and has
[1:12:03] patience and for my name's sake has
[1:12:05] labored and has not
[1:12:09] feigning young people many times the
[1:12:12] devil wants you to think that God's just
[1:12:13] a judge and every time you mess up and
[1:12:15] every time you fall he's just there to
[1:12:17] whip you and judge you until you're not
[1:12:19] good enough and the word says right here
[1:12:21] he notices the good that you've done he
[1:12:23] notices the fact that you overcame
[1:12:25] yesterday he saw the situation that you
[1:12:27] faced and you stood the test he's not
[1:12:29] just sitting there going yep you messed

[1:12:39] he's not he is like a proud parent right
[1:12:41] here and he's saying I see what you've
[1:12:43] done I see how you've stood and many
[1:12:46] times the devil wants to make it so hard
[1:12:47] for you to come back because you mess up
[1:12:49] you say this is all that God sees God
[1:12:51] ain't looking at that stand up repent
[1:12:53] and come back to God
[1:12:55] just get up from where you're at get up
[1:12:57] from where you're falling from it if you
[1:12:58] fall and you get discouraged don't stay
[1:13:00] down get up he's not sitting there
[1:13:03] keeping a tally of all your mistakes he
[1:13:05] says I know it's hard out there I've
[1:13:07] seen you stand I've seen you fight I've
[1:13:10] seen your victories he's not just
[1:13:12] keeping up with your defeats he's not
[1:13:15] just keeping up with your stumbles he's
[1:13:17] keeping a tally of all the times you've
[1:13:20] won

[1:13:27] you're so bad you're so he's going look
[1:13:28] at all the good you've done look at all
[1:13:31] the things that you have done he points
[1:13:32] out all the good things that they've
[1:13:34] done in the age
[1:13:38] persecution always has been a part of
[1:13:41] the church
[1:13:42] and the church always will be persecuted
[1:13:45] brother Brown says the children of this
[1:13:47] world controlled by the devil hate the
[1:13:51] children of God who are controlled by
[1:13:54] the spirit
[1:13:55] Cain persecuted Abel Esau hated Jacob
[1:13:58] Judas betrayed Jesus and the list goes
[1:14:01] on and on and on you can be the nicest
[1:14:05] guy in the world you can treat everybody
[1:14:07] with kindness
[1:14:09] you cannot have a blip on your life but
[1:14:11] let people find out that you believe in
[1:14:13] being filled with the Holy Ghost that
[1:14:15] you believe in signs and wonders and
[1:14:16] gifts and that your life surrendered to
[1:14:18] the Lord Jesus Christ and see if there
[1:14:20] ain't some mocking and things that'll
[1:14:21] start to come your way
[1:14:23] see if little jokes and things and
[1:14:25] persecution won't begin to come your way
[1:14:27] in the world Listen we're sheltered
[1:14:29] sometimes from a lot of it because we
[1:14:30] live in What's called the Bible Belt and
[1:14:32] as crazy as the world is where we live
[1:14:34] you just don't even know
[1:14:38] just Drive West a little ways or drive
[1:14:41] to the Northeast a little ways you know
[1:14:42] it's getting to where just drive to
[1:14:43] Walmart it's getting pretty bad here too
[1:14:46] but it still ain't what it was there is
[1:14:48] real persecution against people who hold
[1:14:51] to the testimony
[1:14:53] he says let him confess Christ as his
[1:14:55] Savior and acknowledge the operation of
[1:14:57] the gifts of the holy spirit in tongues
[1:14:59] prophecy healing Miracles and he will be
[1:15:03] condemned the spirit of this world hates
[1:15:06] the spirit of God
[1:15:09] but trials always have been and they
[1:15:12] always will be
[1:15:14] maybe you've been persecuted maybe at
[1:15:15] school maybe you have a hard time
[1:15:17] holding your testimony amongst friends
[1:15:20] maybe you struggle
[1:15:21] maybe you feel like you can't keep going
[1:15:27] I don't know where all of y'all are at
[1:15:29] tonight but don't give up
[1:15:31] don't give in
[1:15:34] I know some days you feel like you've
[1:15:35] reached the breaking point sometimes you
[1:15:37] feel like I just can't take another step
[1:15:38] some days you feel like I'm just so sick
[1:15:40] of it all just get up and take another
[1:15:43] step
[1:15:44] just keep fighting just listen I promise
[1:15:47] you the reward is great the struggle may
[1:15:50] be hard but I promise you the reward is
[1:15:52] great and it's not that far away it's
[1:15:54] not listen we're at the end of the end
[1:15:55] just keep fighting another day one of
[1:15:57] these mornings one of these days your
[1:16:00] reward will be Eternal every struggle
[1:16:02] and every battle and every depression
[1:16:03] and every anxiety and everything that
[1:16:05] came and fought against you all those
[1:16:06] days you felt all alone will feel like
[1:16:08] nothing every fear you won't even
[1:16:10] remember them because the reward is
[1:16:12] going to be so great keep pressing the
[1:16:15] battle keep pressing the battle do not
[1:16:17] give up where you are so you're
[1:16:18] persecuted so you're in a trial remember
[1:16:20] you're being made into pure gold don't
[1:16:22] give up now we're so close we are so
[1:16:25] close I'm just telling you just to keep
[1:16:27] fighting and keep pushing the the reward
[1:16:29] is right at hand we're right there at it
[1:16:33] he says Thou cannot bear them which are
[1:16:35] evil and thou has tried them which say
[1:16:38] their Apostles and are not and has found
[1:16:40] them Liars
[1:16:44] and I want to deal with something here
[1:16:45] for just a minute
[1:16:46] these people had come out of the world
[1:16:49] they had worked so hard and fought so
[1:16:51] hard for Truth Listen being a Christian
[1:16:53] in the first age was not an easy thing
[1:16:58] I'll just put like this Christianity was
[1:16:59] a very new religion
[1:17:01] this was a world where there was
[1:17:03] thousands upon thousands upon thousands
[1:17:05] of gods normal people had a God for
[1:17:07] everything they had a God for everything
[1:17:09] and here comes Paul saying no there is
[1:17:11] one God all your gods are false
[1:17:13] there is one God for everything listen
[1:17:15] Christians were a hated people because
[1:17:18] it wasn't just that they believed
[1:17:20] something different is that what they
[1:17:21] believed cast down everything everybody
[1:17:23] in the world believed
[1:17:25] it was not an easy time and these people
[1:17:28] had come out of the world and they had
[1:17:29] fought so hard for truth fought so hard
[1:17:32] for the life that they had they had
[1:17:34] endured so much
[1:17:36] it says Thou cannot bear them which are
[1:17:39] evil what's this saying they weren't
[1:17:41] about to let the world
[1:17:43] come in amongst them
[1:17:47] come on young people
[1:17:48] listen we shouldn't ostracize anybody
[1:17:51] who's struggling
[1:17:52] we shouldn't make anybody feel like an
[1:17:54] awful sinner
[1:17:55] but we got to have the courage look we
[1:17:57] fought too hard
[1:17:59] we've come too far
[1:18:01] we've got Godly homes we've got a Godly
[1:18:03] church we got Godly youth groups you
[1:18:06] ought to have enough backbone about you
[1:18:07] to say hey we don't talk like that here
[1:18:12] hey we're not going to listen to that
[1:18:14] kind of music you ought to have enough
[1:18:15] Christianity about you to be able to
[1:18:18] stand up and say we fought too hard and
[1:18:20] we've come too far we're not going to
[1:18:22] let that stuff come in here
[1:18:24] we're not going to allow that stuff in
[1:18:26] you got to be willing to say no not on
[1:18:28] my watch
[1:18:29] I've fought too hard to allow to come in
[1:18:31] Jesus Praises them
[1:18:33] for for these things and it says he says
[1:18:36] you have found talking about false
[1:18:38] Apostles now you have found them to be
[1:18:40] Liars
[1:18:42] how do they find these false Apostles to
[1:18:44] be Liars
[1:18:45] he's praising them for identifying false
[1:18:48] Apostles for being able to pick out the
[1:18:50] wolves in sheep's clothing as it were
[1:18:52] because what it is we're going back to
[1:18:54] the key at the very beginning of
[1:18:56] tonight's lesson what was the key
[1:18:58] Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same
[1:19:01] yesterday today and forever
[1:19:03] and Paul had come and he had warmed and
[1:19:05] they recognized that what Paul preached
[1:19:08] was the truth what Paul preached was the
[1:19:11] Revelation what Paul was was the
[1:19:14] messenger and so what they did is they
[1:19:16] took that key the same key brother Brown
[1:19:18] told us about and they applaud it to the
[1:19:20] doctrines that were being taught they
[1:19:22] applaud it to these false Apostles they
[1:19:25] knew that the Revelation that God had
[1:19:27] given to Paul was the only revelation
[1:19:30] so if someone came preaching something
[1:19:32] different from Paul they said you're
[1:19:34] false
[1:19:35] that is false and that's not true you
[1:19:37] talk about boldness you know today we
[1:19:39] pet things and we got well we should
[1:19:41] draw our Circle bigger and fellowship
[1:19:43] and in that day they said you're Liars
[1:19:46] I'm not advocating that I'm just telling
[1:19:48] you what the pattern is
[1:19:53] they said you're Liars
[1:19:55] well that's because they got up and they
[1:19:56] were just preaching totally off no
[1:19:59] that's not what the word says
[1:20:01] matter of fact brother Branham and tells
[1:20:04] us that it was so subtle
[1:20:06] so close to exactly what Paul preached
[1:20:09] that they didn't see it coming in
[1:20:12] but they were willing to stand up and
[1:20:14] say
[1:20:15] y'all are liars
[1:20:17] stand for what the truth was he says
[1:20:20] they looked at these false prophets in
[1:20:22] the eye and said you are not saying what
[1:20:24] Paul said you therefore are false he
[1:20:29] says oh that sets my heart on fire
[1:20:32] that would set a lot of us offended
[1:20:37] but for brother Branham it set his heart
[1:20:39] on fire
[1:20:40] get back to the word oh wait I thought
[1:20:42] it was I don't know listen get back to
[1:20:45] the word it is not that you that really
[1:20:48] tries the apostles and the prophet and
[1:20:51] the teacher it's the word that tries
[1:20:54] them it's not for us to say well I think
[1:20:57] I don't necessarily agree and you know
[1:20:58] what he says just take it to the word
[1:21:00] if what they're preaching lines up with
[1:21:02] the word it's true but if it don't line
[1:21:05] up to the pattern
[1:21:07] they're Liars
[1:21:09] they're false
[1:21:11] or his brother Timothy was preaching
[1:21:12] that he said you traitors
[1:21:15] because we know what the pattern is
[1:21:19] anti-word
[1:21:21] is Antichrist
[1:21:24] he said already they were denying the
[1:21:26] word and setting up their own Creeds and
[1:21:28] philosophies instead of the word
[1:21:32] now we know that Jesus is the word
[1:21:35] so if your anti-word
[1:21:37] you're Antichrist if you argue with the
[1:21:41] word
[1:21:42] you're Antichrist
[1:21:44] he says these people are not blatantly
[1:21:48] deniers
[1:21:51] seed
[1:21:52] it starts
[1:21:54] real
[1:21:55] small
[1:21:56] the original trick of Satan in the
[1:21:58] garden
[1:21:59] he didn't come tell even though
[1:22:00] everything he told you is a lie
[1:22:03] no no he changed one word
[1:22:05] he says that in Ephesus it was just the
[1:22:07] same just a word added just a word taken
[1:22:13] away and the anti-word
[1:22:16] Antichrist Spirit began
[1:22:19] to flourish
[1:22:22] it's just a seed
[1:22:23] but it begins to grow a little more in
[1:22:26] every age a little more in every age
[1:22:28] until that Antichrist system eventually
[1:22:31] takes over complete control and and then
[1:22:33] it gets to a point toward the truth of
[1:22:35] the word is actually fought against by
[1:22:37] the false prophets
[1:22:40] just to see
[1:22:44] if I can bring it down tonight to your
[1:22:46] relationship
[1:22:47] but brother and it's just a small thing
[1:22:50] it's just a song
[1:22:52] it's just a this it's just a that it's
[1:22:55] just a it's just a it's just a seed
[1:23:01] but seeds hear me young people
[1:23:04] seeds will have a harvest
[1:23:08] I'll tell you there's not one person
[1:23:10] that is backslid away from God
[1:23:14] I'll bring it right here there's not one
[1:23:16] young person that used to be amongst us
[1:23:18] that has went out into the world that
[1:23:20] when they were sitting here at the age
[1:23:21] of 12 13 14 15 16 thought
[1:23:24] I'm gonna be a sinner
[1:23:27] I can't wait
[1:23:30] I want to get on the road to hell
[1:23:33] I want to be a druggie
[1:23:36] I want to get to the place where I can't
[1:23:38] even hold a job and I'm worthless and
[1:23:39] I'm no good and I'm reprobating
[1:23:42] promise you that ain't nobody's thought
[1:23:44] their thought is what's wrong with that
[1:23:46] song
[1:23:52] their thought is
[1:23:53] that's just Mom
[1:23:57] that's just brother Tim he's a little
[1:23:58] bit old-fashioned
[1:24:00] no that's the pattern
[1:24:03] and that seed
[1:24:05] in and of itself
[1:24:08] might not can do much
[1:24:10] but that seed has a harvest
[1:24:15] you will reap what you sow what's that
[1:24:19] mean most of us probably know but
[1:24:22] whatever seeds you throw in the garden
[1:24:25] that's what's coming out of your garden
[1:24:27] you sow righteousness
[1:24:30] you'll reap righteousness
[1:24:32] you sow Rebellion
[1:24:35] you'll reap Rebellion
[1:24:37] these things were small in Ephesus
[1:24:42] they come in unawares
[1:24:45] but this church
[1:24:47] Falls so far that in the Book of
[1:24:49] Revelation she's the cage of every
[1:24:52] unclean and hateful bird
[1:24:55] she falls that far because of seeds that
[1:24:58] come to harvest
[1:25:01] the name of Christ
[1:25:03] as we said a while ago it was a time of
[1:25:05] idolatry and there were so many gods and
[1:25:08] so many different things
[1:25:10] but the Lord commends them
[1:25:12] because they stood for the name of
[1:25:14] Christ
[1:25:15] he says there that you have stood and
[1:25:17] labored for my name they stood for the
[1:25:20] name
[1:25:22] he says these people weren't only giving
[1:25:24] lip service to that name
[1:25:26] all they did they did in the name these
[1:25:29] Ephesians were Christians they bore a
[1:25:32] name and that name was Christ who was
[1:25:35] the spirit of God within them and which
[1:25:37] was one of the threefold names
[1:25:40] of their lord they knew the power in
[1:25:43] that name they knew the righteousness of
[1:25:45] that name they bore the name so much
[1:25:47] until it became their identification and
[1:25:49] Antioch and they became known as
[1:25:51] Christians because they followed Christ
[1:25:55] now you don't get that name because you
[1:25:56] went to church on Wednesday they got
[1:25:59] that name because everything they did
[1:26:00] the way they lived the way they acted
[1:26:02] the way they conducted themselves was
[1:26:04] after the spirit of Christ
[1:26:06] and it became who they were and it was
[1:26:08] something that they bore and the Lord
[1:26:10] commends them for this because in this
[1:26:12] age as we said there's so many other
[1:26:13] gods there's so many other names but
[1:26:15] they were willing to Bear up the name of
[1:26:17] Christ they were willing to hold it up
[1:26:18] they were willing to say no we're
[1:26:20] Christians and they held up the name of
[1:26:22] Christ
[1:26:25] then we get to the the very end of the
[1:26:27] age
[1:26:29] or towards the end of the age here it
[1:26:31] says the complaint of God
[1:26:33] Revelation 2 4 nevertheless now he's
[1:26:36] listed all the good things
[1:26:38] but there isn't nevertheless
[1:26:40] I have somewhat against thee because
[1:26:42] thou has left thy first love
[1:26:45] when he says this he
[1:26:47] he's not necessarily speaking of the
[1:26:49] original Christians that they're at the
[1:26:51] very beginning of Ephesus but he's
[1:26:53] speaking to the entire age so all the
[1:26:55] generations that live within this 120
[1:26:57] year age
[1:27:00] it's the exact same thing that we see
[1:27:02] all through the Old Testament as God
[1:27:04] would move in Israel
[1:27:06] and they would be on fire and they would
[1:27:08] repent and they would come back to God
[1:27:09] but then the next Generation would be a
[1:27:11] little less fervor than the Next
[1:27:13] Generation a little less fervor and then
[1:27:15] he said by the fourth generation the
[1:27:17] Revival fires would be nothing but a
[1:27:18] little bit of Embers
[1:27:21] they've left their first love
[1:27:24] that doesn't mean they're out sinning
[1:27:25] and doing awful things that means Jesus
[1:27:27] isn't coming first in their life
[1:27:31] I like to try to bring it down to things
[1:27:33] we can relate to there's more reals than
[1:27:35] scriptures
[1:27:40] more movies than messages
[1:27:43] whatever however I can get it to relate
[1:27:45] to you your first love has now been
[1:27:47] replaced by things of the world
[1:27:50] notice it doesn't even say they don't
[1:27:51] love Jesus
[1:27:54] I'm not saying you don't love the Lord
[1:27:55] I'm asking is he still your first love
[1:27:59] is he still your first love
[1:28:02] because that's what he had against the
[1:28:03] entire age you left your first love
[1:28:07] you left the one the the passion that
[1:28:09] you had for me the Zeal that you had for
[1:28:12] me when you left from Youth Camp and you
[1:28:13] said I'll never go back to that
[1:28:14] lukewarmness again
[1:28:19] the first love where is it he says I
[1:28:21] have somewhat against you
[1:28:24] he says the fervent desire to please God
[1:28:27] the passion to know his word the cry for
[1:28:29] the reaching out and the spirit all
[1:28:31] begins to fade and instead of that
[1:28:34] Church being on fire with the fire of
[1:28:36] God it has cooled off and become a bit
[1:28:39] formal
[1:28:41] it's the cycle of Revival and death and
[1:28:43] we've heard it many times from here the
[1:28:45] cycle of Revival and death has never
[1:28:46] failed
[1:28:47] until now
[1:28:49] the cycle of Revival and death has to
[1:28:51] fail because it's been Revival and death
[1:28:53] Revival and death Revival and death but
[1:28:56] we're coming to a place where it's
[1:28:57] Revival and rapture
[1:29:00] there's going to be a people willing to
[1:29:01] fight for their inalienable rights
[1:29:03] willing to say I have a right to that I
[1:29:05] have a right to what they had at
[1:29:06] Pentecost I have a right to what they
[1:29:08] had in the first age I have a right to a
[1:29:10] body change I have a right to a Rapture
[1:29:12] but you're gonna have to be willing to
[1:29:15] fight for it because what happened in
[1:29:17] the first age it wasn't something big
[1:29:18] they began to care what the world
[1:29:20] thought
[1:29:22] think about it they begin to care what
[1:29:25] the world thought instead of caring only
[1:29:27] what God thought
[1:29:29] and they began to cool off
[1:29:31] and to try to tame down their services
[1:29:36] young people we can't leave our first
[1:29:38] love
[1:29:39] it's the history of the church
[1:29:41] he says oh Ephesian Church something's
[1:29:44] happening to you
[1:29:47] take the take the word church out of it
[1:29:49] put your name there tonight
[1:29:51] put your name between the commas where
[1:29:54] it says Ephesian Church put your name
[1:30:00] Oh Aaron something is happening to you
[1:30:04] he says but they're doing it so subtly
[1:30:05] that you can't see it
[1:30:07] go back to Pentecost before it's too
[1:30:09] late
[1:30:11] go back to your first love before it's
[1:30:13] too late
[1:30:14] go back
[1:30:20] he says remember therefore for once Thou
[1:30:22] Art Fallen
[1:30:24] and repent
[1:30:26] and do the first works
[1:30:28] or else I will come unto thee quickly
[1:30:30] and remove that Candlestick out of his
[1:30:31] place except thou repent
[1:30:34] God says remember
[1:30:36] where they are fallen in other words no
[1:30:38] is he didn't tell them you didn't have
[1:30:39] nothing
[1:30:40] he didn't say what you had wasn't real
[1:30:46] it was remember the passion remember the
[1:30:49] Zeal remember what I've done for you
[1:30:50] remember the passion that I had for you
[1:30:52] remember the relationship we had
[1:30:54] remember what it was like when you was
[1:30:55] on fire remember what it was like when
[1:30:57] you were serving me wholeheartedly
[1:30:59] remember
[1:31:00] where you have fallen from
[1:31:02] he says in repent
[1:31:05] and do the first works
[1:31:09] he says get back to the origin
[1:31:12] back to The Wonder of Pentecost
[1:31:14] how do you get back there
[1:31:16] Pentecost was the origin of the church
[1:31:18] your Pentecost your new birth is the
[1:31:21] origin of your of your life
[1:31:24] they had forgotten the glory of it all
[1:31:25] had just become church services it had
[1:31:27] become Wednesday it had become Sunday it
[1:31:28] had become rules it had become a
[1:31:30] lifestyle no different than the Amish
[1:31:33] he says get back to the glory of it I'll
[1:31:35] get back to the Wonder of it all repent
[1:31:37] before your light goes out
[1:31:39] he says don't hesitate
[1:31:42] he says the glory of God decreased ever
[1:31:44] so rapidly it was not long until the
[1:31:46] city was in Ruins its glorious Temple
[1:31:49] became a shapeless Mass the land became
[1:31:51] a marsh inhabited by waterfowl the
[1:31:54] population was gone except for a few
[1:31:56] unbelievers in a squalid Village there
[1:31:58] was not even one Christian left
[1:32:02] think about this
[1:32:05] oh Peter James John
[1:32:08] the disciples the apostles the great
[1:32:10] there wasn't one Christian left
[1:32:14] because he said don't hesitate
[1:32:16] repent
[1:32:17] but apparently they hesitated
[1:32:22] will you bow your heads with me tonight
[1:32:29] had no intention to take it this way but
[1:32:31] I just want to give you an opportunity
[1:32:32] to search your soul right now
[1:32:37] things come in so quick they come in so
[1:32:39] easy and they seem so harmless
[1:32:43] don't hesitate
[1:32:46] repent
[1:32:50] don't hesitate
[1:32:53] repent
[1:32:57] what are you asking me to do brother
[1:32:58] Aaron I'm asking you to search your
[1:32:59] heart right now
[1:33:03] I'm asking you right where you're at I'm
[1:33:05] not even calling you here
[1:33:07] I'm asking you right where you're at
[1:33:12] to be real honest with yourself
[1:33:17] have you forgotten your first love
[1:33:24] age of all ages it was Ephesus
[1:33:28] the pattern
[1:33:31] and he says remember where you're
[1:33:33] falling from
[1:33:35] remember what I called you to
[1:33:37] and call you to be some denomination and
[1:33:40] call you to be a church member I didn't
[1:33:42] call you to be lukewarm I called you to
[1:33:43] be the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:33:46] remember the joy of the Lord
[1:33:51] remember the Deliverance you had
[1:33:54] [Music]
[1:33:55] remember what it was like to be in love
[1:33:57] with me
[1:34:01] do you remember
[1:34:03] or have we slid too far
[1:34:06] have we slid so far
[1:34:10] it's not too late
[1:34:14] I want to remind you of something that
[1:34:16] right now he's not looking at a list of
[1:34:18] your failures
[1:34:20] he has a list of all the times you stood
[1:34:24] he has a list of all the times you
[1:34:25] fought
[1:34:26] he has a list of all the times that you
[1:34:28] overcame
[1:34:30] but he says I have somewhat against thee
[1:34:35] what is it that came in and put out the
[1:34:37] light
[1:34:39] what is it that came and stole the joy
[1:34:42] and he cries out to Ephesus repent
[1:34:45] and had she done so
[1:34:48] I would have been forgiven all would
[1:34:50] have been restored that's the place you
[1:34:52] sit in right now
[1:34:53] maybe you haven't gone far maybe it's a
[1:34:55] step maybe it's a little slide maybe

[1:35:22] crush tonight
[1:35:24] will you come lay them down at this
