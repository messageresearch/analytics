========================================

[Music] I've been through heartbreak, through trials of many kind. Running on my own, but running out of fight. The enemy had me, thinking I would lose. I called on my savior. My savior came through. Through Jesus I have overcome. Through Jesus all my change. By his power I stay in victory. The Lord has washed my sins away. His presence is my hiding place. The devil know if he's ever going to get to me. You got to go through Jesus. Through Jesus. His arms around me. There's no place I'd rather be. What can come against me in the shadow of me? I know the battle's coming, but I won't be afraid. Oh no, I know the God who defeated the grave. Through Jesus I have overcome. Through Jesus all my chains are gone. By his power I stand in victory. His blood wash my sins away. His presence is my hiding place. know if he's ever going to get to me. He's got to go through Jesus. Through Jesus. He is on my side. He gives me what I'm needing. I can do all things. Do all things through Jesus. He is on my side. gives me what I needed. I can do all things. Do all things through Jesus. My change are gone. By his power, I stand in victory. and wash my sins away. His presence is my new Jesus. [Applause] Jesus through Jesus. I go through Jesus. [Applause] [Music]
