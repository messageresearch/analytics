[22:09] as brother Tim comes and as they make
[22:10] their way amen let's sing this song
[22:13] bring them
[22:16] in bring them
[22:19] in bring the little ones to
[22:25] Jesus bring them in
[22:29] bring them
[22:31] in bring the little ones to
[22:37] [Music]
[22:48] Jesus wow what a treasure you have
[22:51] here Michael
[22:54] Paul that's a strong name Michael who is
[22:58] like
[22:59] Jehovah we are we are thankful for the
[23:03] blessings of the Lord's Upon Our Lives
[23:05] and truly children are a gift of God and
[23:09] and God has entrusted a gift to your
[23:13] life uh it's a blessing that God has
[23:16] bestowed upon you and um today as we
[23:21] think of that blessing I I go back to
[23:24] the the thought when the parents brought
[23:27] Jesus to the temple to be to be um
[23:32] offered and dedicated to the Lord and
[23:35] and here we are at this moment in time
[23:37] and holding a little gift of God in our
[23:40] hands today to offer to God back what he
[23:44] gave us what a blessing it is life is
[23:48] such a blessing but with it of course
[23:50] comes a
[23:52] responsibility and it's not only these
[23:54] parents responsibility but us as a whole
[23:57] church family
[23:59] to provide support and loving care and
[24:03] guidance to a little child like this to
[24:05] be here for it to be a beacon an example
[24:09] for this child to follow and of course
[24:13] all of the work that we could do whether
[24:15] it be in Sunday school and and
[24:18] admonitions and preaching from the
[24:20] pulpit does very little good unless it's
[24:23] also at
[24:25] home and so you know it starts with a
[24:28] Godly home it starts with parents that
[24:30] are consecrated to God dedicated to God
[24:35] and today when we hold this
[24:37] responsibility then we know that God has
[24:42] empowered us and entrusted us with this
[24:46] and that he is more than able to give us
[24:49] the wisdom and the guidance the
[24:51] leadership a long life's journey and so
[24:55] today God has given you an awful
[24:57] wonderful gift it's
[25:01] precious value it thank God for it and
[25:06] then don't mess up with what God gave
[25:09] you by living a life that is
[25:14] fruitful that is one that is worthy of
[25:17] following that we can say to this child
[25:21] follow me as I follow Christ let's pray
[25:25] today as we offer this little child to
[25:28] do the Lord father we want to thank you
[25:31] for this little couple Lord standing
[25:33] here oh God it speaks of Grace it speaks
[25:36] of redemption it speaks of the love that
[25:39] you have for us Lord we thank you for
[25:43] the work that you're doing in their
[25:44] lives and you have done and we're asking
[25:47] for your blessings to be upon this
[25:50] family upon the union Lord upon the
[25:53] mother and the dad that they would
[25:55] follow you with all their hearts and
[25:57] give a loving caring example for this
[26:01] child to follow to point it always to
[26:04] Jesus Christ now today I hold this child
[26:09] in my hand and I bless it oh God in your
[26:13] name I ask the angels of God I know

[57:33] our hearts make yourself known God I'm
[57:37] here there's fragments of thoughts that

[57:52] can Lord as a human

[59:20] today come to my Pew and speak to me in
[59:25] Jesus name
[59:26] amen amen God bless
[59:30] you as always it's wonderful to be here
[59:35] thank you for being here today and some
[59:37] of you have driven a long way and made a
[59:41] lot of sacrifices to be here Jesus knows
[59:45] and he knows exactly what your need is
[59:47] the desire in your heart and the longing
[59:50] in your soul he's here to speak to you
[59:54] in a very real way let's look to John
[59:58] chapter 4 and we'll read from verse
[1:00:01] three and it's a little bit lengthy
[1:00:03] scripture reading this morning but I I
[1:00:06] love the word of God and I I think um
[1:00:09] it's Eternal I know it is and so because
[1:00:13] it is an eternal word I believe that it
[1:00:15] is applicable for the day that we're
[1:00:17] living in and as I've been pointing out
[1:00:20] to you it is a prophecy of the last day
[1:00:24] and so as we look at the scripture and
[1:00:27] we realize it is prophesying of a people
[1:00:31] in this last day who is the Fulfillment
[1:00:34] of the word of God then you know we want
[1:00:37] to just look into it and and search the
[1:00:40] scripture because it speaks of us John 4
[1:00:43] and verse3 he left Judea and departed
[1:00:48] again unto Galilee and he must needs go
[1:00:52] through Samaria then cometh he to a city
[1:00:55] of Samaria area which is called sikar
[1:00:58] near the to the parcel of ground that
[1:01:01] Jacob gave to his son Joseph now Jacob's
[1:01:05] Well was there and Jesus therefore being
[1:01:08] wearied with his journey sat thus on the
[1:01:11] well and it was about the sixth hour and
[1:01:14] there cometh a woman of Samaria to uh
[1:01:19] draw water and Jesus said unto her give
[1:01:22] me to drink for his disciples were going
[1:01:26] away into the city to buy meat then SE
[1:01:29] the woman of Samaria unto him how is it
[1:01:33] that thou being a Jew askest drink of me
[1:01:37] which am a woman of Samaria for the Jews
[1:01:40] have no dealings with the Samaritans and
[1:01:43] Jesus answered and said unto her if thou
[1:01:46] knewest the gift of God and who it is
[1:01:49] that said to thee give me to drink thou
[1:01:52] wouldest ask of him and he would have
[1:01:55] given thee living water and the woman
[1:01:58] said unto him sir thou H has nothing to
[1:02:01] draw with and the well is deep from
[1:02:04] whence then hast thou that Living Water
[1:02:07] art thou greater than our father Jacob
[1:02:10] which gave us this well and drank
[1:02:12] thereof himself and his children and his
[1:02:15] cattle and Jesus answered and said unto
[1:02:18] her whosoever drinketh of this water
[1:02:21] shall thirst again but whosoever
[1:02:24] drinketh of the water that I shall give
[1:02:27] him shall never thirst but the water
[1:02:30] that I shall give him shall be in him a
[1:02:34] well of Living Water of water springing
[1:02:37] up into everlasting life and the woman
[1:02:41] said unto him sir give me this water
[1:02:45] that I thirst not neither come hither to
[1:02:48] draw and Jesus said unto her go call thy
[1:02:52] husband and come hither and the woman
[1:02:56] answered and Saidi have no husband and
[1:02:59] Jesus said unto her thou has said well I
[1:03:01] have no husband for thou Hast had five
[1:03:04] husbands and he whom thou Hast is not
[1:03:08] thy husband in thou this in that said us
[1:03:12] thou truly and the woman said unto him
[1:03:15] sir I perceive that thou art a prophet
[1:03:19] our fathers worshiped in this mountain
[1:03:21] and you say that in Jerusalem is the
[1:03:24] place where men ought to worship and
[1:03:27] Jesus said unto her woman believe me the
[1:03:30] hour cometh when ye shall neither in
[1:03:33] this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem
[1:03:35] worship the father you worship ye know
[1:03:39] not what we know what we worship for
[1:03:42] salvation is is of the Jews but the hour
[1:03:47] cometh and now is when the true
[1:03:50] worshippers shall worship the father in
[1:03:53] spirit and in truth for the father
[1:03:56] seeketh such to worship him God is a
[1:03:59] spirit and they that worship Him must
[1:04:02] worship Him in spirit and in truth the
[1:04:06] woman said unto him I know that the
[1:04:08] Messiah cometh which is called the
[1:04:10] Christ when he is come he will tell us
[1:04:12] all things and Jesus said unto her I
[1:04:16] that speak unto thee am he and upon this
[1:04:20] came his disciples and marveled that he
[1:04:23] talked with the woman yet no man men
[1:04:26] said what seekest thou or why talkest
[1:04:29] thou with her the woman then left her
[1:04:32] water pot and went her away into the
[1:04:34] City and said to the men come see a man
[1:04:38] which told me all things that I ever did
[1:04:42] is not this the Christ God bless you you
[1:04:45] can be
[1:04:47] seated as I said we are once again
[1:04:50] searching the scriptures today we are
[1:04:53] looking for their testimony
[1:04:56] and their witness of us and the day and
[1:04:58] hour that we're living in we are drawing
[1:05:02] comfort from the scripture to know you
[1:05:05] know exactly what time we are in and
[1:05:08] where we are in this journey as Daniel's
[1:05:11] searched the books to see if it was time
[1:05:14] to go back to the Homeland we are also
[1:05:18] searching the book is this the time of
[1:05:21] the Rapture of the church you know we
[1:05:23] want to know exactly
[1:05:26] the day and the hour that we're living
[1:05:28] in as brother BR preached to us of the
[1:05:31] importance of recognizing our day and
[1:05:34] his message it would be to Jerusalem
[1:05:38] that Jesus would say as he wept over
[1:05:41] them oh that you would have known this
[1:05:44] and and this thy this thy day that the
[1:05:49] the the things concerning thy peace if
[1:05:51] you would have just known it but because
[1:05:54] you didn't know because you turned a
[1:05:56] blind eye and was insensitive to what I
[1:06:00] was doing and could not discern the time
[1:06:03] and the hour then judgment has come upon
[1:06:06] you and knowing that this is a day of
[1:06:10] trouble we are searching the book to
[1:06:13] find rest and and this unnamed woman the
[1:06:17] one we call the woman at the well
[1:06:19] contains the way into the entrance of
[1:06:22] the Supernatural and brother bram's me
[1:06:25] readings it was the most told story to
[1:06:29] contact the human spirit and to open the
[1:06:33] door to the supernatural he would he
[1:06:36] would tell this and and this would as he
[1:06:39] would begin to tell it it would begin to
[1:06:41] unfold as he and then he would step into
[1:06:44] that door of Supernatural and do the
[1:06:47] same things that Jesus did Discerning
[1:06:50] the the thoughts and intents of the
[1:06:52] heart and it was here through this
[1:06:55] dialogue that Jesus contacted and opened
[1:06:58] up This Woman's Spirit to in order to
[1:07:02] receive Redemption now her sin was
[1:07:05] exposed but also the questions of her
[1:07:08] heart was answered and and and of course
[1:07:13] it was here that we learned from this
[1:07:15] discourse what is the source of true
[1:07:19] worship So today we're going to be
[1:07:21] speaking on true worship in spirit and
[1:07:24] in truth
[1:07:26] because we we Ponder and it's been
[1:07:28] questioned and it always will be asked
[1:07:32] and thought of and promoted um of one
[1:07:35] place or another to be the place where
[1:07:38] God will meet a man or a woman and so
[1:07:42] here again you know what is the source
[1:07:44] of true worship was it a place was it on
[1:07:48] a mountain or was it at Jerusalem you
[1:07:51] see the Samaritans believed that Jehovah
[1:07:55] was to be worshiped on on Mount uh
[1:07:58] Garrison while the Jews believed that
[1:08:01] God was to be worshiped in Jerusalem and
[1:08:05] at that moment in time while Jesus was
[1:08:08] talking to the woman he declared to her
[1:08:11] you worship you know not what we know
[1:08:15] what we worship for salvation is of the
[1:08:18] Jews and of course at that moment that
[1:08:22] was where where God uh where salvation
[1:08:26] was was under the blood of bulls and
[1:08:29] goats and and yet Jesus points at the
[1:08:33] same time to the end of that worship and
[1:08:37] and he says um to her in verse 21 woman
[1:08:41] believe me the hour cometh when you will
[1:08:45] neither in this mountain nor yet at
[1:08:48] Jerusalem worship the father but the
[1:08:51] hour cometh verse 23 the hour cometh and
[1:08:55] and now is when the true worshippers
[1:08:58] shall worship the father in spirit and
[1:09:01] in truth for the father seeketh such to
[1:09:05] worship him God is a spirit and they
[1:09:08] that worship Him must worship Him in
[1:09:10] spirit and in truth so this tells us
[1:09:13] that God has a chosen place of worship
[1:09:18] and of course that is always where he
[1:09:20] put his name he would it would be where
[1:09:24] he placed his name would be where that
[1:09:27] he would command men to worship if
[1:09:30] you'll look with me to Deuteronomy um 16
[1:09:33] verse two thou shalt therefore sacrifice
[1:09:36] the Passover unto the Lord thy God and
[1:09:39] of the flock and the herd in the place
[1:09:42] which the Lord shall choose to place his
[1:09:45] name there so you can see God would have
[1:09:48] a place that he wanted to be worshiped
[1:09:51] and he would put his name in that place
[1:09:55] so it was very important to know the
[1:09:58] name of God and know where he chose to
[1:10:01] put his name and of course the Jews
[1:10:04] believed that Jerusalem was where God
[1:10:07] had chosen to put it place his name and
[1:10:10] they had good reason to believe that
[1:10:12] because the glory of the Lord had come
[1:10:15] down and filled Solomon's Temple and had
[1:10:19] accepted the sacrifice there and while
[1:10:22] at the same time the Samaritans who were
[1:10:25] foreigners um into the land of of Israel
[1:10:28] they were brought there and by the
[1:10:30] Assyrians the Babylonians from other
[1:10:33] nations and some had mixed with the Jews
[1:10:36] and and they were produced kind of a a
[1:10:40] hybrid race and a hybrid religion and
[1:10:43] and they insisted that mount gism was
[1:10:47] the true place of worship and they had
[1:10:50] built a temple there to rival The Temple
[1:10:53] at Jerusalem and the Samaritans accepted
[1:10:57] now they believed parts of the word and
[1:11:00] which is why they built their Temple
[1:11:03] there they they read in the first five
[1:11:06] books of Moses um of how that God's
[1:11:10] blessing where the blessings of God came
[1:11:13] down as he as they when they entered the
[1:11:15] land he had some of the people to stand
[1:11:18] upon Mount garam and the other people to
[1:11:22] stand upon Mount eel and one was
[1:11:24] pronounced curses and the other was
[1:11:27] pronounced blessings and here upon Mount
[1:11:30] gsam was the blessings had been
[1:11:33] pronounced uh here upon this mountain
[1:11:36] and the Samaritans based this on the
[1:11:40] first five books of Moses but they
[1:11:43] rejected the rest of the Bible you see
[1:11:46] so their claim was based on some
[1:11:49] scripture but not all the scripture and
[1:11:53] so they would refuse to act actually see
[1:11:56] the progression where that God did
[1:11:59] indeed pronounce blessings here but now
[1:12:02] he had a place where he had chosen to
[1:12:04] put his name and they refused to see the
[1:12:07] progression how that the kind of Glory
[1:12:11] came down into Solomon's Temple and they
[1:12:14] only would point back to the blessings
[1:12:17] upon Mount GIS now so Jesus would say
[1:12:21] you worship what you know not what you
[1:12:23] don't take all the scripture you don't
[1:12:26] see the progression you refuse to see
[1:12:29] part of the word you worship what you
[1:12:32] you know not what we know what we
[1:12:35] worship for our Salvation is of the Jews
[1:12:39] but then Jesus said he pronounced
[1:12:42] something very stunning he said that
[1:12:45] Jerusalem was
[1:12:47] ceasing that it would no longer be the
[1:12:50] place of worship and so he was saying
[1:12:54] the hour com
[1:12:56] and yet now is you know you see when
[1:12:59] true worshippers shall worship the
[1:13:01] father in spirit and in truth for he
[1:13:04] says the father seeketh such to worship
[1:13:08] Him and of course today that's the
[1:13:11] problem that we have around the world
[1:13:14] today every denomination and religion
[1:13:16] claims to be the Jerusalem that God has
[1:13:20] chosen to put his name and then every
[1:13:23] cult including message calls wants to
[1:13:26] believe their mountain of truth that
[1:13:29] they are piled up like a mountain of
[1:13:31] evidence is God's chosen place of
[1:13:34] worship but there is only one place that
[1:13:38] God has chosen to put his name and it is
[1:13:41] only there that you can have true
[1:13:44] worship all other worship is for nothing
[1:13:47] it is in vain and it is true worship
[1:13:51] that God wants and only true worship
[1:13:54] will God accept it's the kind God seeks
[1:13:58] and that he wants now it was true that
[1:14:02] there were blessings pronounced on Mount
[1:14:04] Garrison and that that's where God was
[1:14:07] but that was not where he was at present
[1:14:10] and Jesus said Jerusalem as a place of
[1:14:14] worship would also become obsolete that
[1:14:18] it would no longer be the place where
[1:14:21] you were required to go and worship and
[1:14:24] it would was true that Solomon's Temple
[1:14:27] in Jerusalem once held the Shina Glory
[1:14:31] that upon that spot upon that hill now
[1:14:34] of course that Temple had been
[1:14:36] demolished of course now we have herod's
[1:14:39] Temple and it is built up and it's a
[1:14:41] beautiful edifice and and it's a great
[1:14:43] Memorial and it's a great church but
[1:14:47] there's no spirit in
[1:14:49] it amen there never comes a kind of
[1:14:52] Glory to fill that Temple that was never
[1:14:55] there but there had been a time in the
[1:14:59] past on that spot on Temple rock where
[1:15:03] the spirit of God came down and dwelt
[1:15:06] and and there kind of Glory went behind
[1:15:09] the holiest of holies but the day Jesus
[1:15:13] was crucified while hanging on the cross
[1:15:17] a lightning boat from Heaven ripped the
[1:15:20] veil from the of the temple from top to
[1:15:23] bottom and it revealed and showed there
[1:15:26] was no God there there was absolutely
[1:15:29] nothing there no sh kind of Glory no
[1:15:33] power of God no anointing of God no God
[1:15:36] there at all just a empty
[1:15:43] elice a religion without
[1:15:46] power a religion without life a worship
[1:15:51] that could not change a life
[1:15:55] I want you to
[1:15:56] think where was that glory of God
[1:15:59] now where did he
[1:16:02] dwell where had he chosen to put his
[1:16:05] name we look away from there right down
[1:16:08] the hill from there on Mount Mariah and
[1:16:11] they're hanging at the near the same
[1:16:14] place that Abraham would offer Isaac was
[1:16:17] the son of God hanging upon a cross and
[1:16:20] he was the sacrifice received by God as
[1:16:23] Jesus cried into thy hands I command my
[1:16:27] spirit and it's proof that he was
[1:16:30] received on the third day he rose from
[1:16:33] the dead you see it was the proof it was
[1:16:38] the proof of the sh kind of Glory of the
[1:16:41] power of Resurrection it was the proof
[1:16:45] of the spirit of God that was there in
[1:16:48] Jesus Christ and as Jesus said the hour
[1:16:52] cometh when you will neither in this
[1:16:54] Mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship
[1:16:58] the father you see Jerusalem was ceasing
[1:17:02] it would no longer be a place where God
[1:17:06] would meet his people it would no longer
[1:17:09] be a all the all the sacrifices the
[1:17:12] offerings that were made the the worship
[1:17:15] the fastings the prayers would no longer
[1:17:18] be accepted now we do know they were
[1:17:21] accepted just a little bit earlier
[1:17:23] because Zachariah met an angel
[1:17:26] there amen and they and as he offered
[1:17:30] the incense and his prayers went up the
[1:17:32] angel comes and answers to prayer and
[1:17:35] says I'm going to I'm going to send the
[1:17:37] Messiah but but before I do I'm sending
[1:17:40] Elijah the prophet and he's going to
[1:17:42] he's going to be the Forerunner for this
[1:17:45] Messiah to come you see God had had
[1:17:49] actually spoke in that Temple but now in
[1:17:53] this moment now all of a sudden it
[1:17:57] changes it changes from that that
[1:18:01] edifice on on that heel to a man hanging
[1:18:05] on a cross now I want you to understand
[1:18:09] brother Brandon picks this up in the
[1:18:11] message indictment let me share it with
[1:18:13] you he said now Christ is God's provided
[1:18:17] lamb now notice how appropriate it was
[1:18:20] showing that Jerusalem was ceasing it
[1:18:24] was an effect until that
[1:18:29] hour amen it was an effect to that hour
[1:18:32] remember remember this I want you to
[1:18:35] stop and think brother randam said you
[1:18:37] know that that there will come a time
[1:18:39] where they will scream this is in the
[1:18:41] seals they will scream and cry and it
[1:18:44] and they will get nothing it will be
[1:18:46] revealed in the
[1:18:50] Thunders to think about this the day
[1:18:54] before
[1:18:55] the day before they could come to that
[1:18:58] altar they could offer a lamb it would
[1:19:02] be
[1:19:03] accepted but suddenly it changes and you
[1:19:06] can bring the same lamb that Moses said
[1:19:09] bring the same thing and go through the
[1:19:12] same rituals that had been said for
[1:19:14] hundreds and thousands of years and had
[1:19:16] worked and had interceded and prayers
[1:19:19] were received and all of a sudden they
[1:19:22] changes
[1:19:29] yeah there's no God
[1:19:31] there he is
[1:19:34] left I want you to think as brother
[1:19:38] randam
[1:19:39] said they will scream and cry and get
[1:19:44] nothing can you imagine coming to the
[1:19:47] same
[1:19:48] altars that Moses
[1:19:51] instituted the same set up copying
[1:19:56] mirroring everything that he saw in
[1:19:59] heaven and now
[1:20:01] come and offer the same kind of
[1:20:04] prayers that had worked days before
[1:20:08] months before years before and now
[1:20:14] nothing you see it was an effect under
[1:20:16] that hour the blood of the Lamb was all
[1:20:19] right we're talking about the animal
[1:20:21] lamb was all right until that day but
[1:20:24] but at the crucifixion it changes the
[1:20:28] old system is
[1:20:31] done amen there's a new one and the lamb
[1:20:34] was at the sacrifice the lamb the
[1:20:38] sacrificial lamb was on the grounds and
[1:20:40] they were condemning and doing the very
[1:20:43] same things there that they had to do
[1:20:45] that's right and then he goes on and
[1:20:47] brings it forward to our day and God be
[1:20:50] blessed for this wonderful Heavenly
[1:20:52] light in this last day because that
[1:20:54] churches is doing the same thing until
[1:20:58] the hour that organization religion is
[1:21:00] condemned and proved to be sacrificing
[1:21:04] Christ's word from then on comes the
[1:21:06] word and the word only from the Pascal
[1:21:09] lamb passed away and the Christ become
[1:21:12] our lamb at the day of crucifixion at
[1:21:15] the day that the denomination crucified
[1:21:18] the word of God and accepted a greed
[1:21:21] instead of the word that's the day that
[1:21:24] the word came into full effect that's
[1:21:28] right I'll tell you what we're living in
[1:21:31] a day where the word has full
[1:21:34] effect that's right that's why we preach
[1:21:36] a Full Gospel a full word full power
[1:21:40] full
[1:21:42] anointing that's now you
[1:21:45] see you can look away from this empty
[1:21:48] edifice this holy worship the
[1:21:52] rituals hear the the splitting of the
[1:21:54] veil had unveiled there was no God
[1:21:58] there but where was their God he was
[1:22:01] hanging on a
[1:22:03] cross and Jesus was shown to be the
[1:22:06] temple the place where God receives true
[1:22:09] worship gears might have been the place
[1:22:12] of blessings Jerusalem may have been and
[1:22:16] was the place where thousands Came To
[1:22:19] Worship and the glory of God had once
[1:22:22] filled the temple and they could talk
[1:22:24] about how God answered prayer here and
[1:22:27] what God did here and how he acted there
[1:22:31] and how his presence felt and and had so
[1:22:33] overcome the priest till they were
[1:22:35] unable to even Minister and and the the
[1:22:38] singers and everything the glory fi the
[1:22:41] temple they could talk about what was
[1:22:45] passed but they couldn't point out and
[1:22:48] identify a present tense God
[1:22:55] understand this our worship must have a
[1:22:58] present tense
[1:23:02] God God without a
[1:23:05] doubt once moved in denominational
[1:23:09] systems that's why they built an altar
[1:23:12] there the methodists built an
[1:23:14] altar the Lutheran built an altar each
[1:23:18] one had their Jerusalem or their gism
[1:23:21] you know there had a place God met me
[1:23:23] here here's where here's where he moved
[1:23:27] here's what he
[1:23:29] did and and it was a truly a move of God
[1:23:33] it wasn't fake it wasn't false it was
[1:23:35] God that's where he
[1:23:39] was but that was not where he
[1:23:43] is and that's why they built an altar
[1:23:46] but that day brother bradam said that
[1:23:49] denominations crucified the word of God
[1:23:52] and accepted a Creed instead of the word
[1:23:55] that's the day the word comes into full
[1:23:59] effect now all must come to God's only
[1:24:03] provided place of worship and that's in
[1:24:06] Christ he is seeking those to worship
[1:24:10] him both in spirit and truth remember
[1:24:12] it's the place where God has chosen to
[1:24:14] put his
[1:24:16] name amen and he play he chose to put
[1:24:19] his name in Jesus Christ so therefore it
[1:24:23] is in that name by putting his name in
[1:24:25] Christ it designated him to be the
[1:24:28] specific place of worship choosing to
[1:24:32] meet with and be worshiped by people in
[1:24:36] Christ
[1:24:38] alone now I want you to notice something
[1:24:42] here Christ is represented by a male
[1:24:48] lamb the lamb had to be a male not a
[1:24:52] female
[1:24:54] God's chosen this this shows us God's
[1:24:57] chosen place of worship is not in a
[1:25:02] church but it's in Jesus
[1:25:06] Christ God did not put her name
[1:25:10] anywhere but put his name in
[1:25:13] him and this signifies that salvation is
[1:25:17] found only in Jesus Christ and not in
[1:25:20] any church or any Creed or person our
[1:25:24] holy
[1:25:26] place now God did not choose a church
[1:25:31] represented as a she but
[1:25:34] rather but rather him remember he chose
[1:25:37] a place to worship be worshiped as not a
[1:25:40] she but rather him him being the meeting
[1:25:44] place the lamb this male lamb is
[1:25:46] significance because it must be without
[1:25:51] blemish however you see Christ embodies
[1:25:55] his Pur Purity and even his Pilot his
[1:25:58] enemy testified that he could find no
[1:26:00] fault in him and brother bradam
[1:26:03] Illustrated this point saying can a
[1:26:06] church can a group can a denomination
[1:26:09] can it
[1:26:11] bleed he asked us to illustrate the
[1:26:14] point that denominations cannot provide
[1:26:17] the same lifegiving sacrifice that Jesus
[1:26:20] did he emphasized it a denomination like
[1:26:23] a bill in our organization cannot bleed
[1:26:27] because it does not possess the essence
[1:26:29] of life that the blood represents so
[1:26:33] brother Brandon and God's chosen place
[1:26:35] of worship he talks about this he said
[1:26:38] notice here the type of Passover
[1:26:41] foreshadowed Jesus we notice that here
[1:26:45] the sacrifice of Blood by death the
[1:26:48] sacrifice of blood was the place that
[1:26:51] foreshadowed Christ can a denomination
[1:26:53] BL bleed could you think of a church
[1:26:55] bleeding a denomination bleeding
[1:26:58] certainly not it took blood to bleed
[1:27:00] from a life and the life here Jesus
[1:27:03] comes in view by the lamb the lamb was a
[1:27:07] type of Christ and foreshadowed Christ
[1:27:09] because he was the Lamb of God that John
[1:27:12] introduced that takes away the sin the
[1:27:14] world and Jesus coming to view here in
[1:27:17] Exodus chapter 12 notice it was the only
[1:27:20] place death could not strike When Death
[1:27:23] was was about to strike the land there
[1:27:25] had to be a certain place all from under
[1:27:29] this died only one place I didn't mean
[1:27:32] it was one house but there was one place
[1:27:35] where the lamb was killed where the
[1:27:37] Lamb's blood was the death angel could
[1:27:39] not strike because it was the one place
[1:27:43] God had put his name and that lamb was
[1:27:46] named back Yonder in beginning a lamb
[1:27:48] notice it was the one place he could not
[1:27:52] strike so now what we learn from this
[1:27:55] your church is a collective body our
[1:27:59] group of churches like of like
[1:28:01] Fellowship might be great people in
[1:28:05] it but if you deny the body the blood
[1:28:08] and the blood is the spirit are the word
[1:28:11] you're dead the minute you do it you see
[1:28:14] this is what happened when they denied
[1:28:16] and crucified the the word and what it
[1:28:19] did it only caused the word to come into
[1:28:21] full
[1:28:22] effect but it also cast out the other
[1:28:26] places as place of worship so you see
[1:28:29] Jesus Christ is where he chose to place
[1:28:32] his name not not in a church but in his
[1:28:37] son Jesus Christ notice it was a maale
[1:28:41] lamb a he not her not a church she but
[1:28:45] his name not her name where was he going
[1:28:48] to meet the people was not in her name
[1:28:52] but in his name him the lamb notice now
[1:28:57] we say the church the Great Mighty
[1:29:00] Church she did this she did that she's
[1:29:02] weighed the storms we picked up in
[1:29:04] population we're great in numbers we're
[1:29:06] a mighty Church she's a great thing but
[1:29:09] God never said anything about a
[1:29:12] she said him him is the meeting place
[1:29:16] the lamb not the church not her name but
[1:29:20] his name he didn't put her name anywhere
[1:29:24] he put his name in
[1:29:28] him so today the only place of worship
[1:29:33] is in Jesus
[1:29:34] Christ and God chooses that place of
[1:29:37] worship puts his name there and I
[1:29:39] remember it was God's choice not man's
[1:29:42] Choice man cannot choose the place to
[1:29:45] worship that is God's chosen place and
[1:29:49] some today want to insist I'm going I'm
[1:29:51] dealing with something for a minute
[1:29:53] because some sometimes people today want
[1:29:55] to insist that God's place of worship
[1:29:58] today is in the
[1:30:00] bride and then they labeled that group
[1:30:04] that supports their preferred Doctrine
[1:30:06] to be the bride so that means they
[1:30:09] believe that she and not he is the place
[1:30:13] of
[1:30:14] worship now you see here again he did
[1:30:19] not put Worship in her name but in his
[1:30:23] name it doesn't lay in
[1:30:26] her I don't care we can form message
[1:30:29] groups or have a message Church it
[1:30:31] doesn't matter that's not where his name
[1:30:33] is his name is in
[1:30:36] Christ you can come here and never enter
[1:30:39] into worship but if you can get into
[1:30:42] Jesus Christ by one Spirit you're
[1:30:45] baptized in that body filled with the
[1:30:47] Holy Ghost what is it that is the place
[1:30:50] where you really worship that's where
[1:30:52] worship is accepted
[1:30:54] nothing outside of
[1:30:56] [Applause]
[1:30:58] that but how is it that Christians
[1:31:00] started worshiping in her name and not
[1:31:04] his
[1:31:05] name how is it that many are called by
[1:31:09] her
[1:31:10] name and not his name why is it even
[1:31:14] that baptism is that act of claiming a
[1:31:17] soul for Christ is not done in his name
[1:31:22] in marriage the bride takes on the name
[1:31:24] of the groom in birth the child takes on
[1:31:26] the name of the father and Ephesians
[1:31:28] 3:15 said of whom the whole family in
[1:31:31] Heaven and Earth is named so you see the
[1:31:34] original Church started out with true
[1:31:36] worship they they had truth and they had
[1:31:39] spirit with
[1:31:40] it amen look look here they had they had
[1:31:44] the double portion they had spirit and
[1:31:47] in truth they did not have Spirit
[1:31:50] without truth neither did they have
[1:31:51] truth without Spirit but wasn't long
[1:31:55] before men who arose who took elements
[1:31:59] of Truth and distorted them much like
[1:32:02] the Samaritans had done ignoring parts
[1:32:06] of the word and esteeming other parts of
[1:32:10] the word in the sardan age in the first
[1:32:14] uh in the first step back toward
[1:32:16] restoration you remember God gave us
[1:32:19] gath and rebuke now you young people
[1:32:21] were privileged the other night to hear
[1:32:23] one wonderful message on the church ages
[1:32:26] from from our brother Aaron those of you
[1:32:29] that was not here or didn't stream it
[1:32:31] I'm going to go back over some of those
[1:32:32] points for you if you were here I'm
[1:32:35] going to just make sure you got
[1:32:38] it so you know you know yeah I'm I'm
[1:32:42] going to I'm actually going to repr
[1:32:43] preach some of his sermon not because he
[1:32:45] didn't do it good because you didn't
[1:32:47] hear it
[1:32:48] good so in Revelation 3 and 1 unto the
[1:32:52] angel of the church start is right these
[1:32:55] things saith he that hath the seven
[1:32:58] spirits of God and the Seven Stars I
[1:33:00] Know Thy work that thou Hast a name that
[1:33:04] thou livest and are dead Be watchful and
[1:33:07] strengthen the things which remain that
[1:33:10] are ready to die for I have not found
[1:33:13] thy works perfect before God so here
[1:33:16] Jesus addresses now this church which is
[1:33:20] actually making the first step toward
[1:33:24] toward
[1:33:25] restoration they are not restoration
[1:33:28] they are re in reformation and Jesus
[1:33:31] says of her of them said I know your
[1:33:34] works that you got a name that you're
[1:33:36] dead in verse two he said I've not found
[1:33:38] that works perfect before God and we
[1:33:41] find that that in most ages the spirit
[1:33:44] has praised the true church so that
[1:33:46] would be that would be praise and then
[1:33:49] he would tell them things he was
[1:33:50] displeased with for example he would say
[1:33:53] say to the first days um you know he
[1:33:57] would praise them you've tried those
[1:33:59] apostles who said they were uh who said
[1:34:02] they were true and you found them liars
[1:34:03] and and that they're not true Apostles
[1:34:06] and you you stood there right in their
[1:34:08] face and said you're not saying what
[1:34:09] Paul said therefore you're false and he
[1:34:13] he praised him for that but then he
[1:34:14] turns around but I got somewhat against
[1:34:16] you but in this age this entire age is
[1:34:21] an age of complete condemn Nation that's
[1:34:24] right there isn't you've done some good
[1:34:27] works and you you know you you've done
[1:34:30] well here or there he says nothing of
[1:34:33] good works there's there's no praise
[1:34:35] it's only
[1:34:37] condemnation and brother brandham talks
[1:34:40] about that he said one the leadership of
[1:34:42] the spirit is superseded by human
[1:34:45] hierarchy to the poor pure word of God
[1:34:47] and it's free benefit to all men was put
[1:34:49] aside for Creeds and dogmas and politics
[1:34:52] and and he says three Worship in spirit
[1:34:56] and gifts of the Spirit were cast aside
[1:34:58] for mariolatry and was was assuming a
[1:35:02] greater place in the Christian worship
[1:35:04] notice as he says the woman the woman
[1:35:08] Mary became the preeminent
[1:35:11] one even the one that you must you must
[1:35:15] approach that you know he she only could
[1:35:18] T turn the Heart of Jesus that God was
[1:35:22] mad at you and the father would kill you
[1:35:26] but this loving mother would turn the
[1:35:28] Heart of Jesus to intercede on the
[1:35:30] behalf of his father so you could be
[1:35:34] saved can you imagine that now so you
[1:35:38] see in that time there were there was
[1:35:41] begin to be you know the the the church
[1:35:44] begin to worship and you know the Mary
[1:35:47] then become the principal figure of the
[1:35:49] church and during this time in history
[1:35:52] there was a lot of
[1:35:54] technological advancements uh many many
[1:35:58] things that began to happen you know
[1:35:59] there was great advances like the
[1:36:01] Gutenberg printing press there in
[1:36:03] Germany and and that there was travel
[1:36:05] that increased and ideas began to spread
[1:36:09] and there would be Scholars who come
[1:36:12] with with the word I want you to get it
[1:36:13] they're bringing word they're bringing
[1:36:15] the Bible nobody's ever seen the Bible
[1:36:19] nobody's been able to open his precious
[1:36:21] pages and read it I want you to remember
[1:36:25] when you read your Bible or you don't
[1:36:26] read your Bible men
[1:36:31] died burned a steak for putting it in
[1:36:34] your
[1:36:35] language for making it
[1:36:38] available it was given with a great
[1:36:41] cost and you know where there there they
[1:36:44] had brought Greek manuscripts of the
[1:36:47] word which would be you know the purest
[1:36:50] form you know you could get Latin and
[1:36:51] translate it from Latin but somebody
[1:36:53] translated that from Greek into Latin
[1:36:56] and so they they would bring the the
[1:36:58] closest thing the closest language that
[1:37:00] they could could get and they would they
[1:37:03] would then translate it from that purest
[1:37:06] form into the languages of Germany or
[1:37:09] languages of of England and and so um
[1:37:14] this this be to push the the Reformation
[1:37:17] so strongly books and tracks were
[1:37:20] spreading with great FY and the Bible
[1:37:23] was being put in the hands of of the
[1:37:25] common people and in that day and it
[1:37:28] wasn't too many years ago that even in
[1:37:31] Catholic Nations to be caught reading a
[1:37:33] Bible would send you to
[1:37:36] death that's exactly right it was not to
[1:37:39] be read by you because you couldn't
[1:37:44] understand it therefore we'll tell you
[1:37:47] what we want you to know and so this but
[1:37:52] with all of this word coming I mean the
[1:37:57] Bible for the first time and we read it
[1:38:01] and Men starts getting different
[1:38:05] opinions and from these opinions sprung
[1:38:12] denominations you know you would think
[1:38:14] how is that more word yet there's more
[1:38:17] sex and more Splinter groups that makes
[1:38:20] more denomination you see because true
[1:38:23] trth without
[1:38:25] spirit makes
[1:38:30] denominations it makes the the the
[1:38:34] temples on Mount garison it makes the
[1:38:37] temples in
[1:38:39] Jerusalem where that no God is there but
[1:38:43] God was
[1:38:45] here God once
[1:38:48] moved this is what God one time did
[1:38:52] listen church we can m must never get
[1:38:54] into the place where that our God is a
[1:38:57] god of History that's alone but that a
[1:39:01] prophet in this day came to raise him up
[1:39:03] out of History to show him as a present
[1:39:07] tense God Amen not a god of the past but
[1:39:11] the god of the present and out of there
[1:39:14] many men got inspired and begin to rise
[1:39:17] up and would see parts of the scripture
[1:39:20] and Calvinism would would would go take
[1:39:22] off and it would out there would come
[1:39:24] his his teachings would come
[1:39:25] denominations and then Armenian ISM took
[1:39:28] an opposite sight to that no it means
[1:39:30] this and so they built their their
[1:39:34] temples and this is the Jerusalem and
[1:39:36] this is where all men must come to
[1:39:38] worship and then of course their minds
[1:39:41] are so still so tainted with the
[1:39:43] hierarchy of Catholicism they use they
[1:39:46] were so used to Bishops and archbishops
[1:39:48] that was supposed to rule over them they
[1:39:50] just didn't see any need to get away
[1:39:52] from it so they brought that form right
[1:39:55] on in with them and the next thing you
[1:39:58] know you know again they were built on
[1:40:02] the ideas of man and not the inspiration
[1:40:05] of the Holy
[1:40:08] Ghost it was truth without spirit and
[1:40:12] truth without Spirit becomes
[1:40:18] hybridized it becomes
[1:40:21] unbalanced now instead of a Reformation
[1:40:24] or restoration it was a Reformation it
[1:40:26] was just reforming trying to reform and
[1:40:29] fix the problem and the errors of the
[1:40:31] church because it recognized the errors
[1:40:35] of the teaching of Rome so here they're
[1:40:36] going to fix
[1:40:39] it but this Reformation would only lead
[1:40:42] to more
[1:40:43] denominations more
[1:40:46] daughters to the great now
[1:40:49] remember now you know sometimes people
[1:40:52] get offended because you use that term
[1:40:54] but that's a Bible term and she is a
[1:40:57] because she was untrue to her
[1:40:58] husband she took in seeds of other men
[1:41:02] and gave birth to men's
[1:41:05] ideas and produced out of them instead
[1:41:08] of Christians Baptists methodists
[1:41:10] Presbyterians
[1:41:12] Catholics and if you're not careful
[1:41:18] message let's remember friends when we
[1:41:22] when we see men rise and and and lives
[1:41:25] produced that are in the
[1:41:27] image of the woman instead of the image
[1:41:31] of
[1:41:35] Christ then you see that there there's
[1:41:37] something you can't see nothing of
[1:41:39] Christ in it but you see the woman
[1:41:41] because there's some man somewhere who
[1:41:44] is brought in other seeds and so you see
[1:41:47] that the Bible talks about the Judgment
[1:41:50] of the great and we're living in
[1:41:52] the day where judgment Jud is being
[1:41:53] poured out upon the and her
[1:41:55] daughters and part of that judgment
[1:41:59] included this word come out of her my
[1:42:03] people which is why you are here today
[1:42:06] because you are seeking a place of true
[1:42:12] worship because you've seen The
[1:42:14] Emptiness of religion that's right now
[1:42:18] instead of reformation it was a
[1:42:21] restoration it was a Reformation
[1:42:23] information is about having correct
[1:42:25] Doctrine it's about getting Church order
[1:42:29] correct it's about the clergy
[1:42:32] positioned it's about you know
[1:42:34] Reformation comes as men who are leaders
[1:42:38] arise and reform the Church and adjust
[1:42:40] the
[1:42:42] doctrines but as but restoration comes
[1:42:46] and returns to the church by the power
[1:42:48] of Pentecost that's right I want you to
[1:42:52] get it the power Pentecost I'm not
[1:42:54] talking about a move I'm not talking
[1:42:56] about a Zeus street I'm talking about
[1:42:58] the holy spirit amen where it came on
[1:43:01] the day of Pentecost you see so again
[1:43:04] it's truth balanced with spirit and it's
[1:43:07] Spirit balanced with truth it follows
[1:43:11] Jesus all the way it's a double portion
[1:43:14] of John 14:12 where where the true
[1:43:17] church with true worship does the
[1:43:19] Greater
[1:43:22] Works but instead of becoming true
[1:43:24] worship with spirit and Truth they got
[1:43:26] snared in that as one began to jockey
[1:43:30] for who's got the greater Ministry and
[1:43:32] which church is right and which group of
[1:43:35] reformers is right and who is the most
[1:43:38] influential and they begin to fight over
[1:43:40] members and splitting hairs and worship
[1:43:43] be is becomes a PL becomes a worship of
[1:43:46] Pride as F pet doctrines and ideas
[1:43:49] become exalted
[1:43:54] and brother Aaron wedes tonight or
[1:43:56] Friday night he he U he spoke of that
[1:44:01] that essay that commenius wrote of one
[1:44:04] thing
[1:44:05] needed and and I'm just going to quote a
[1:44:07] few things out of there each Church
[1:44:09] reckons itself as the one the true one
[1:44:12] or at least as the purest truest part of
[1:44:15] it while among themselves they persecute
[1:44:18] each other with the bitterest
[1:44:21] hatred and
[1:44:23] and of course we know this is a shame
[1:44:26] because these people have just come
[1:44:28] together out of the Roman Catholic
[1:44:29] church and and now their persecution is
[1:44:32] on each other you know it doesn't take a
[1:44:36] movement very long they're not very far
[1:44:39] removed until men rise up with little
[1:44:42] isms and
[1:44:43] schisms and pet doctrines and form their
[1:44:47] groups and call their place the
[1:44:51] Jerusalem and that we're the one got it
[1:44:53] right but I want you to understand God
[1:44:57] called a halt to all
[1:45:00] Jerusalem oh mount gism it has all been
[1:45:04] called at halt it is over with in the
[1:45:08] only place of worship is in spirit and
[1:45:12] in truth by meeting in Jesus Christ
[1:45:16] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:45:18] it's the only entrance it is the door
[1:45:21] into Christ
[1:45:27] this is a
[1:45:28] shame it's happened Sal too familiar
[1:45:33] because the cycle of Revival and death
[1:45:36] it never
[1:45:37] fails you see out the Bible they forg
[1:45:40] their different Creeds they these are
[1:45:42] their fortresses their bulwarks there
[1:45:44] behind which they entrench themselves
[1:45:46] and resist all attacks and divine
[1:45:49] service the words of men are usually
[1:45:51] heard more than the word of God the new
[1:45:53] birth how man must be changed in the
[1:45:55] likeness of Christ to become a partaker
[1:45:57] of the divine nature scarcely anything
[1:45:59] is said the faith has been split into a
[1:46:03] thousand little
[1:46:05] parts and I just want to say it's
[1:46:09] incomprehensible how men can take a
[1:46:14] message and split it into so many
[1:46:17] different
[1:46:19] ways until we have a thousand different
[1:46:22] views
[1:46:23] and then we disfellowship because you
[1:46:25] see it a little different
[1:46:28] way and some of them become worse than
[1:46:34] Rome you'd be better off having your son
[1:46:37] married to a Catholic girl and be
[1:46:39] married into some of these
[1:46:45] Cults and that would be
[1:46:49] horrible but as Comedia said there's one
[1:46:52] thing need it return to Christ look to
[1:46:56] Christ as the only leader walking in his
[1:46:58] footsteps setting aside all other ways
[1:47:01] until we all reach the goal and have
[1:47:03] come to the unity of the
[1:47:05] faith but you see it's that Corinthian
[1:47:08] attitude of I'm a Paul and I'm
[1:47:12] Apostle amen I'm a sephus I you know I'm
[1:47:16] I'm third pull or I'm uh two Soul or I'm
[1:47:19] seven Thunder or I'm uh I'm Coleman I'm
[1:47:22] a follower of he's the Apostle or here's
[1:47:25] the here's the veil he's the the teacher
[1:47:28] you know here here's all of this and and
[1:47:30] the next thing you know we have one
[1:47:32] thing raising up in another and it
[1:47:34] causes the body to be
[1:47:36] fragmented and the spirit of God finds
[1:47:38] it
[1:47:40] deplorable it offends
[1:47:42] him because not one of them died for you
[1:47:46] that's and brother Brandon said they are
[1:47:48] living a name but they're dead
[1:47:53] you see certainly they were dead they
[1:47:54] died the minute they organized that's
[1:47:57] what happened with Luther we're talking
[1:47:59] about reformation the you know the the
[1:48:02] beginning of the restoration that died
[1:48:04] the minute they organized the great
[1:48:06] groups tied themselves in matrimony to
[1:48:09] the state and that did it actually they
[1:48:11] would get the power of politics behind
[1:48:13] them so not not just with Luther rising
[1:48:17] up but he would also have men you know
[1:48:20] that were um uh Governors or Kings over
[1:48:24] different cities and they would go to
[1:48:26] war for
[1:48:28] him and they were
[1:48:31] persecutions and there were many
[1:48:34] killed from Protestant and
[1:48:37] Catholic amen even uh you know going
[1:48:40] against the other ones you know one one
[1:48:43] might fight against the tendel move or
[1:48:45] one might fight against the zland move
[1:48:47] and and you know there were millions
[1:48:49] they were they were bloody
[1:48:52] now you
[1:48:54] see they here were these people who had
[1:48:58] criticized the Roman Church they knew
[1:49:00] the unrighteous political and and
[1:49:03] spiritual unions yet Luther as when
[1:49:05] Peter was overbalanced by the judaizers
[1:49:08] went straight ahead and made the state
[1:49:10] instead of God the defender of the Faith
[1:49:14] remember that who is our Defender who is
[1:49:17] the defender of the
[1:49:19] faith only God it ain't it ain't our
[1:49:23] place to to correct
[1:49:25] everybody it isn't our place to to run
[1:49:28] everybody else down and we're right and
[1:49:30] we're to
[1:49:31] Jerusalem it's our place to make a place
[1:49:34] of worship that where we come and honor
[1:49:37] Jesus Christ somebody with me this
[1:49:39] morning amen notice he he's this this
[1:49:42] first denomination of repute that came
[1:49:45] out of the Harlot when Luther died it
[1:49:48] wasn't long until they had a hierarchy
[1:49:50] like the one they fought
[1:49:53] and then this is the reason God was so
[1:49:55] unhappy by the second generation they
[1:49:58] they're they're right they're actually a
[1:50:00] daughter they're just they're just an
[1:50:03] image a smaller a smaller image of the
[1:50:06] Roman system they had gone back and they
[1:50:09] didn't know it and how did this happen
[1:50:12] so quick it don't take
[1:50:14] long amen the second generation and
[1:50:17] doing so they showed they were the
[1:50:19] daughter of the great they defiled
[1:50:21] them themselves became harlot just like
[1:50:23] their mother same ill repute and you
[1:50:26] know how is it because instead of living
[1:50:29] the name of Jesus instead of making his
[1:50:32] name and his word great they took on the
[1:50:35] name of their new churches they begin to
[1:50:38] say we're Lutheran we're Calvinists
[1:50:42] we're we're this one or that one and you
[1:50:44] know it was a name that said we're alive
[1:50:47] you know I'm a Lutheran we're alive you
[1:50:50] know we're we're calvinist we see we've
[1:50:52] got life look at look at our growth look
[1:50:54] at people coming everybody's coming our
[1:50:57] Direction you see see how God is
[1:51:00] blessing look at our huge numbers look
[1:51:02] at our great man but what God was
[1:51:05] looking for was Christians that's
[1:51:08] right amen that's what he's looking for
[1:51:11] today not I'm in the message he's
[1:51:13] looking for sons of God people been
[1:51:15] bored by the spirit people that don't
[1:51:18] just have a name and yet are
[1:51:20] dead but people who have in them people
[1:51:24] who know the true place of worship and
[1:51:27] they have entered into Christ and and
[1:51:29] they're entering into Christ they get
[1:51:31] their prayers
[1:51:35] answered
[1:51:37] Hallelujah you
[1:51:39] see we can look today and say well we
[1:51:41] got a mighty message you know what men
[1:51:43] have done with it in just a few
[1:51:45] Generations they've splendored it into a
[1:51:47] thousand
[1:51:49] pieces it's been a great move of God but
[1:51:52] you see the cycle and Revival of death
[1:51:54] it never fails and some of them must
[1:51:57] become the daughters of the
[1:52:01] you
[1:52:03] see they were living a name that wasn't
[1:52:08] his it a warning to Revelation three
[1:52:12] those in the starting age Be watchful
[1:52:14] and strengthen the things that which
[1:52:16] remain for you're ready to die have not
[1:52:18] found thy Work perfect before God
[1:52:21] brother brandom says of that I wish it
[1:52:24] could be
[1:52:25] said that the sardan age was a
[1:52:28] restoration instead of a
[1:52:30] Reformation I cannot say that the word
[1:52:33] does not call it a restoration it calls
[1:52:36] but certainly calls it a Reformation had
[1:52:39] it been a restoration is everybody
[1:52:42] here ke in right now had it been a
[1:52:46] restoration that age would have been
[1:52:49] another Pentecostal age
[1:52:53] now you know you can't make the word of
[1:52:55] God
[1:52:56] lie amen if we're truly restored we're
[1:52:59] restored back to the faith of the
[1:53:02] fathers how many hundreds of times did
[1:53:05] Brother brandom tell us of why Elija was
[1:53:09] being
[1:53:10] sent to bring a
[1:53:13] restoration a restoration not reform the
[1:53:17] past
[1:53:21] movements not to try to straighten him
[1:53:23] up but to become what was lost that's
[1:53:27] right to be restored back to the
[1:53:30] original Faith again to come back to
[1:53:34] Truth where we can worship God in
[1:53:39] spirit you see had it been a restoration
[1:53:41] that age would have been another
[1:53:43] Pentecostal age but it was not the best
[1:53:45] could say of it could be said of it
[1:53:48] strengthen that which remains that is
[1:53:50] ready to die there was something missing
[1:53:52] my yes it was certainly was that age had
[1:53:54] justification but miss sanctification
[1:53:57] and the baptism with the spirit that's
[1:53:59] what God's original plans was that's
[1:54:02] what they had at Pentecost they were
[1:54:04] Justified they were Sanctified and they
[1:54:07] were filled with the Holy
[1:54:09] Ghost amen so you see that's the reason
[1:54:12] that there is a church it's the it's the
[1:54:15] temple of God filled with God even the
[1:54:17] Holy Ghost The Same Spirit that was in
[1:54:20] Jesus while he was here on the earth
[1:54:21] causing them to do him to do Mighty
[1:54:24] works that he did come back on the
[1:54:25] church at Pentecost so they did the
[1:54:27] works that he did this age did not have
[1:54:29] those works oh they had the written
[1:54:33] word but not the revealed
[1:54:37] word notice revealed words come
[1:54:40] supernaturally that's right it is a
[1:54:42] revelation it comes from God it it's a
[1:54:45] supernatural
[1:54:48] experience but he said this was a
[1:54:51] Reformation but fear not little flock
[1:54:53] God said I will restore that's the
[1:54:55] Comfort we have today I will restore and
[1:54:58] this reform was going to be the start of
[1:55:00] it he according to his promise was to
[1:55:02] take the church from the depth of Satan
[1:55:04] to in the dark ages to the depth of God
[1:55:06] they had at Pentecost and and in the
[1:55:09] first few years of the existence of the
[1:55:11] church so can you
[1:55:14] see why that
[1:55:17] many many will go through the same cycle
[1:55:22] of Revival and death you're blind if you
[1:55:26] can't see the difference if it was a
[1:55:29] restoration it would be another
[1:55:32] Pentecost sure the age had justification
[1:55:35] but it missed sanctification that's
[1:55:37] right it missed the baptism of the Holy
[1:55:40] Ghost and brother brand tells us that
[1:55:42] was his original plan and that's what
[1:55:44] they had at Pentecost they were
[1:55:45] Justified they were Sanctified they were
[1:55:47] filled with the spirit and that it was
[1:55:49] the very reason he sends justification
[1:55:52] that's
[1:55:53] right and I want to just say to you
[1:55:55] today you know if you have been
[1:55:57] justified by faith in other words you
[1:55:59] have repented of your sins that's
[1:56:03] wonderful and that's great that you've
[1:56:05] had that experience and it's real and
[1:56:08] it's true but it's not the stopping
[1:56:10] place that's right it is the place
[1:56:12] you're are starting that's right you're
[1:56:14] going to have to Journey on from there
[1:56:18] amen and and then you go on to
[1:56:20] sanctification and the Very the
[1:56:22] reason for sanctification where you get
[1:56:24] rid of alcohol and tobacco and you live
[1:56:28] true to your your mate and that's
[1:56:30] wonderful you see we we thank God for
[1:56:33] those
[1:56:35] works and I just tell you many of those
[1:56:38] sanctified people who have washed their
[1:56:40] robes in the blood of the Lamb like that
[1:56:42] will find yourself in Great Tribulation
[1:56:44] and give their
[1:56:46] lives they miss a
[1:56:50] Rapture you know they're not true
[1:56:54] worshippers they're partial worshippers
[1:56:57] and God in his grace still gives them a
[1:57:00] away am through
[1:57:03] tribulation but I'm looking for the
[1:57:07] escape the Bible said we're going to
[1:57:09] escape the things that are coming on
[1:57:10] this Earth that's right because we've
[1:57:12] been accounted worthy to stand before
[1:57:14] the son of man Christ and let him judges
[1:57:17] you see God never allowed justification
[1:57:20] just just for justification he never
[1:57:23] allows sanctification just for the sake
[1:57:25] of being Sanctified those are steps that
[1:57:28] God really wants to fill you with his
[1:57:30] spirit is it's to give you it's to give
[1:57:33] you his goal is to give you the baptism
[1:57:36] of the Holy Ghost and that's what all of
[1:57:39] these things these other steps are far
[1:57:42] remember and and we're going to get to
[1:57:44] it in a minute but that's the way it was
[1:57:45] with Elijah and Elisha they would go
[1:57:47] from one place to the other to the other
[1:57:50] but the ultimate goal was to get the
[1:57:52] double
[1:57:53] portion and and you see there there's
[1:57:56] the same things that you know in in
[1:57:59] Ephesians 3:16 he talks about the depth
[1:58:02] the depth of God he said that he would
[1:58:04] Grant you according to the riches of his
[1:58:07] glory to be strengthened with might by
[1:58:10] his spirit in the inner man that Christ
[1:58:13] might dwell in Your Heart by faith that
[1:58:16] you be rooted and grounded in love may
[1:58:19] be able to comprehend with all s what is
[1:58:22] the breath the length the depth and the
[1:58:25] height and to know the love of God which
[1:58:27] passes knowledge and that you may be
[1:58:30] filled with all the fullness of God
[1:58:32] here's the depth of
[1:58:34] God here's what God wants you to have he
[1:58:37] wants you to be able to
[1:58:40] comprehend amen who he is what he is
[1:58:44] what the truth
[1:58:46] is amen but it only comes by him
[1:58:49] dwelling in your heart that's right amen
[1:58:53] amen amen now so when a man experiences
[1:58:56] the depth of God in his life is an
[1:58:59] actual personal experience of the spirit
[1:59:01] of God indwelling in him his mind's
[1:59:04] illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge
[1:59:06] of God through the word but the depth of
[1:59:08] Satan will be that he will attempt to
[1:59:11] destroy this he will always attempt to
[1:59:13] make a sa substitute for this reality of
[1:59:16] God how will he do it he'll take away
[1:59:18] the knowledge of the truth of God
[1:59:19] destroy the word putting forth his own
[1:59:22] yeah ha God
[1:59:24] said remember it's never a complete
[1:59:28] denial and then he will substitute the
[1:59:30] personal Christ in our Spirits he will
[1:59:33] do it as he caused Israel to do the same
[1:59:36] by a human being reigning as a King
[1:59:39] instead of God the Born Again experience
[1:59:41] will be rejected in favor of church
[1:59:44] joining just say I believe the
[1:59:48] message and the fruit of the depth of
[1:59:51] Satan
[1:59:53] which are lies murders and horrible
[1:59:55] crimes came from it so as we look at
[2:00:00] this and try to sum up this part of it
[2:00:03] you know you know as Believing on the
[2:00:05] Lord what one must seek God for the gift
[2:00:08] of the Holy Ghost that's a starting
[2:00:12] Place amen and and let me just say that
[2:00:15] these are all dramatic intense exciting
[2:00:19] nature changing experiences and the book
[2:00:22] of Acts it's a definite overwhelming
[2:00:26] experience with God and among Mage
[2:00:30] Believers too many times they had just
[2:00:32] grew
[2:00:33] up and they embraced the doctrine they
[2:00:35] made a profession of Faith they were
[2:00:38] baptized in water correctly but never
[2:00:41] received the Holy
[2:00:43] Spirit and if you have not the spirit of
[2:00:45] Christ you're none of
[2:00:47] his for by one Spirit you're all
[2:00:51] baptized in one body and we're made to
[2:00:53] drink of one spirit so we got Jesus
[2:00:56] Christ as a chosen place of worship His
[2:00:59] worship is not on a mountain it's not in
[2:01:02] a physical building it's not a group of
[2:01:04] people who assembl under the structure
[2:01:06] of certain doctrines the only place of
[2:01:09] worship is in Jesus Christ for that's
[2:01:12] where God chose to put his name you see
[2:01:15] you cannot offer an acceptable sacrifice
[2:01:19] an acceptable worship unless you are in
[2:01:22] in Christ Jesus for he is the only place
[2:01:26] of
[2:01:28] worship only in Christ is a Redemption
[2:01:31] for sin there is no salvation in any
[2:01:33] other name a person cannot worship
[2:01:36] correctly unless they're in that place
[2:01:39] of worship who is Jesus Christ and you
[2:01:43] get into him how do you get into him by
[2:01:47] one Spirit baptism the baptism of the
[2:01:50] Holy Ghost you are born into him into
[2:01:54] the body of Christ into that place of
[2:01:57] worship sure you going to worship God on
[2:02:00] any mountain you can stack your Stones
[2:02:03] you can make your altars you can make
[2:02:05] your Creeds and your tenants of Faith
[2:02:08] anywhere you want you can offer a
[2:02:10] prayers you can burn incense but Jesus
[2:02:13] said in vain or for nothing do they
[2:02:16] worship me their Doctrine is not the
[2:02:18] word it's the Commandments of men the
[2:02:21] real word is spirit and
[2:02:24] life the real word is spirit and
[2:02:28] truth you see Jesus is that only place
[2:02:32] so when the way a person comes into him
[2:02:35] is by one Holy Spirit if you haven't
[2:02:39] received the the gift of the Holy Ghost
[2:02:41] you are not a worshipper yet you are not
[2:02:45] in that place of worship you're still
[2:02:47] outside the gate
[2:02:52] through this baptism a person's baptized
[2:02:56] into the body of Jesus Christ and
[2:02:58] there's no other way to get into it not
[2:03:01] by Church joining not by getting
[2:03:03] baptized in water not by reciting Creeds
[2:03:08] not by professions of Faith or of any
[2:03:11] other act except by one Holy Spirit
[2:03:18] baptism that's why the holy spirit is
[2:03:21] such an important element of true
[2:03:24] worship without it you're not truly
[2:03:27] worship it you haven't entered yet
[2:03:30] there's this two elements of true
[2:03:32] worship spirit and truth you know pilate
[2:03:34] would ask the question what is
[2:03:36] truth and there's a lot of arguments
[2:03:39] about what truth is that ain't the truth
[2:03:41] this is the truth we have the truth you
[2:03:42] don't have the truth the word is
[2:03:45] truth and truth itself is
[2:03:49] Spirit and the two are in
[2:03:52] Inseparable you cannot have real truth
[2:03:55] without having the spirit you cannot
[2:03:58] have real Spirit without having the
[2:04:01] truth John 16:13 how be it when he the
[2:04:05] spirit of Truth is come I want you to
[2:04:07] understand truth is a person truth is
[2:04:11] not a Creed truth is a person truth is
[2:04:15] not a certain set of sermons truth is a
[2:04:19] person and that person is Jesus Christ
[2:04:22] when he the spirit of Truth is come he
[2:04:25] will guide you into all truth he will
[2:04:28] not speak of himself but whatever he
[2:04:30] shall hear shall he that shall he speak
[2:04:32] and he will show you all things to come
[2:04:35] John 14:16 and I will pray the father
[2:04:38] and he will give you another comforter
[2:04:39] who might how many knows who the
[2:04:41] comforter is that's the Holy Ghost is he
[2:04:44] that he may abide with you forever I
[2:04:46] like that because he doesn't come and go
[2:04:49] he abides he dwells with you you are
[2:04:52] sealed to the day of redemption you're
[2:04:54] not in and out and up and down you're
[2:04:58] solid amen your Nature has been changed
[2:05:01] you can no longer go back and eat the
[2:05:03] dung of the world anymore your your life
[2:05:06] has changed you're no longer a dung
[2:05:08] beetle you're a son or daughter of the
[2:05:10] Living
[2:05:11] God Amen that's where you find life and
[2:05:14] he said I'll give you another comforter
[2:05:16] that may abide for you forever even the
[2:05:18] spirit of Truth so the holy GH ghost is
[2:05:22] the spirit of
[2:05:24] Truth and without the spirit you don't
[2:05:28] have
[2:05:34] truth the world can even the spirit of
[2:05:36] Truth in the world cannot receive
[2:05:38] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[2:05:40] him but you know him for he dwelleth
[2:05:42] with
[2:05:44] you and shall be in
[2:05:47] you because there he was truth standing
[2:05:51] what is
[2:05:53] truth actually pilate was looking at
[2:06:01] truth John 15:26 but when the comforters
[2:06:04] come who will I send I will send to you
[2:06:08] from the father even the spirit of Truth
[2:06:10] which proceedeth from the father he will
[2:06:13] testify or bear witness of me so when
[2:06:17] you get the Holy Ghost it's going to
[2:06:18] Bear witness of Jesus
[2:06:23] now brother bam said in the a message to
[2:06:25] see Jesus I'm thankful that this Spirit
[2:06:29] of Truth was to be with us to the end
[2:06:31] the spirit of Truth is none other than
[2:06:33] the Lord Jesus himself in spiritual form
[2:06:35] he said a little while in the world
[2:06:37] seeth me no more yet you will see me for
[2:06:39] I'll be with you even in you to the end
[2:06:41] of the world and and that means tonight
[2:06:43] wherever you are we are we have the
[2:06:46] comforting words of Jesus knowing Jesus
[2:06:48] will be with us so truth is a spirit it
[2:06:53] is not a Doctrine a certain set of
[2:06:57] teachings it's not a Creed is not an
[2:07:00] academic or educational intellectual
[2:07:04] exercise and only through the spirit can
[2:07:07] you receive true
[2:07:10] Revelation now it would it will require
[2:07:15] the Holy Ghost to understand the word of
[2:07:18] God the Bible said no one can know that
[2:07:20] Jesus is the Christ except by the Holy
[2:07:23] Ghost this is when you know the other
[2:07:26] times is when you
[2:07:28] heard but you will know he is the Christ
[2:07:31] when you receive the Holy
[2:07:33] Ghost amen so truth is a spirit now
[2:07:37] that's a main thing in spirit in in
[2:07:40] that's a main thing as brother Bram
[2:07:42] again says in the power of his
[2:07:44] resurrection not some fundamental
[2:07:45] Doctrine or of something or other that's
[2:07:48] all right brother but the truth without
[2:07:51] spirit is dead that's right you've got
[2:07:53] to have Spirit behind it now we go back
[2:07:58] to the earliest
[2:08:00] worshippers and there was Cain and Abel
[2:08:04] Came To Worship building an altar a
[2:08:07] place to worship at the gates of
[2:08:11] Eden and Cain would offer a worship that
[2:08:15] was unacceptable to God he came to
[2:08:19] worship and God did not honor
[2:08:22] that tells us something God does not
[2:08:25] receive all
[2:08:28] worship Abel comes and he also
[2:08:31] worships his truth and revelation of
[2:08:34] offering of lamb was recognized by God
[2:08:37] God's acceptance of his
[2:08:40] sacrifice how did Abel know what to do
[2:08:43] in order to offer a proper sacrifice to
[2:08:47] God by
[2:08:49] Faith by supern natural divine
[2:08:53] revelation he received Revelation it's
[2:08:57] the
[2:08:58] blood and Cain didn't get a revelation
[2:09:01] even though he had the Commandment so he
[2:09:03] couldn't offer the right
[2:09:05] sacrifice so but you see but through his
[2:09:09] academic human
[2:09:12] reasoning he brought the works of his
[2:09:15] hands however it was a supernatural
[2:09:18] Revelation from God that made the
[2:09:20] difference that gave Abel eternal life
[2:09:25] so both Cain and Abel offered what they
[2:09:28] called
[2:09:29] Truth and when God recognizes worship
[2:09:33] the fire
[2:09:35] falls there is Dynamics to go with the
[2:09:39] mechanics there is healings and miracles
[2:09:41] and signs and
[2:09:43] wonders somebody help me preach brother
[2:09:46] RAM and God's provided place of worship
[2:09:48] he would bring it and show the Dynamics
[2:09:50] in the mechanics and how that we would
[2:09:53] have to have both of them he said now
[2:09:55] we've had great schools of theologies
[2:09:58] nothing against it certainly not but you
[2:10:01] see when you got a School of Theology
[2:10:03] Jesus said the time is coming and now he
[2:10:05] is when God being the spirit will be
[2:10:07] Worship in spirit and in truth that that
[2:10:09] may have been a great move of God in the
[2:10:12] past but that ain't what God honors now
[2:10:15] so now people have Spirit no truth
[2:10:19] others have truth no spirit
[2:10:22] so he like he said we have two cars we
[2:10:24] have a cad both of them are Cadillacs
[2:10:27] and both of them are look alike and both
[2:10:29] of them are we fill up with gasoline and
[2:10:32] both of them you know have all of it the
[2:10:35] seats are right the steering wheels
[2:10:37] pretty it's got diamond studs it's plush
[2:10:39] it's got all of this but one of them's
[2:10:41] got the right mechanics and one of
[2:10:43] them's got mechanics and
[2:10:45] Dynamics you see you might know the
[2:10:47] mechanics he said but it takes the
[2:10:49] Dynamics to start mechanics to make them
[2:10:52] work what am I trying to tell you truth
[2:10:55] without Spirit won't work you'll never
[2:10:59] get off the ground in the Rapture unless
[2:11:02] the spirit of God is permeating the
[2:11:05] lives of the people and making the word
[2:11:08] to
[2:11:09] work Hallelujah that Cadillac's got to
[2:11:12] drive down to Healing to miracles to
[2:11:15] signs to
[2:11:16] wonders it's got to drive to the body
[2:11:19] change to rapture
[2:11:22] amen amen oh he said what's the matter
[2:11:25] with the church today we're full of
[2:11:27] theology without Dynamics in it I say
[2:11:29] God help us not to repeat
[2:11:32] that amen he said I think what's the
[2:11:35] matter with the church today we're
[2:11:37] lacking the dynamical power to press
[2:11:40] this word and make it live for this
[2:11:43] day amen you know I want you to say I I
[2:11:47] don't believe we're lacking
[2:11:49] word I think we got plenty of word amen
[2:11:53] but there's got to be a spark there's
[2:11:56] got to be the life of the spirit that
[2:11:58] makes that word work and brother B said
[2:12:01] Luther had mechanics and Dynamics for
[2:12:04] his day he would make he would make that
[2:12:06] just shall live by faith work Wesley had
[2:12:10] it on his day Pentecost had it with
[2:12:12] their day what about our
[2:12:14] day I'm reading this is another time the
[2:12:18] church should be fully grown now ready
[2:12:20] to meet Christ with the
[2:12:23] manifestation of every blessing that he
[2:12:26] promised in the Bible operating in that
[2:12:28] one great body where he promised that he
[2:12:32] would meet the people and be worshiped
[2:12:34] in this great church of his so notice
[2:12:38] what he says we now what about our age
[2:12:41] we can talk about Pentecost oh they were
[2:12:43] moved oh we can talk about Wesley oh
[2:12:46] they fainted under the power we can talk
[2:12:48] about Luther you know all of these
[2:12:50] things but here what about our day this
[2:12:53] is another time I'm repeating that the
[2:12:56] church should be fully grown now we
[2:12:58] ought to be a mature group amen ready to
[2:13:02] go to meet Christ with the
[2:13:05] manifestation of Every
[2:13:09] Blessing amen of Every Blessing we we're
[2:13:11] not just trying to emphasize one part
[2:13:14] and not the other we want all the word
[2:13:16] to
[2:13:18] work amen every promise in the book is
[2:13:20] mine
[2:13:21] M Hallelujah every blessing is mine amen
[2:13:25] oh brother Jim we we don't want it to
[2:13:28] blow out the whistle well I do I wanted
[2:13:31] to shout the glories of God I want to
[2:13:33] give praise to his name but I wanted to
[2:13:36] do more than that I want it to run down
[2:13:38] the track I want to hear it as it runs
[2:13:41] down Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[2:13:44] today and forever and it drives me right
[2:13:47] down to Healing to Deliverance to the
[2:13:50] baptism of the Hool go that's what I
[2:13:52] want to
[2:13:54] see Hallelujah I want to see deliver
[2:13:58] young people I want to just deliver the
[2:14:00] old I want to see it spark fa in the
[2:14:03] hearts and lives of men and women I want
[2:14:05] to see the dynamic power of the Holy
[2:14:08] Ghost make that train move down the road
[2:14:11] blow it out the whistle say glory to God
[2:14:14] but let's put it in the gear let's move
[2:14:17] on to let's see God in his work
[2:14:23] we're fully grown now ready to go meet
[2:14:26] Christ with the very manifestation of
[2:14:29] every
[2:14:30] blessing that he promised in the
[2:14:36] Bible
[2:14:38] Hallelujah Cain's worship is a
[2:14:42] powerless
[2:14:44] religion Cain's worship requires
[2:14:48] psychology man's efforts to adjust
[2:14:52] sinful nature
[2:14:55] impulses Abel's worship brings death to
[2:15:02] self where you die with your sacrifice
[2:15:06] on the
[2:15:08] altar amen and the life of God comeing
[2:15:11] down replacing sin
[2:15:15] nature amen I I don't care what
[2:15:18] experience you had if it didn't replace
[2:15:19] sin nature it's not much
[2:15:23] value if it didn't change your life if
[2:15:26] it didn't make you into a son or
[2:15:28] daughter of God if it only reformed you
[2:15:31] for a time but didn't restore you back
[2:15:34] to the original thought that God had in
[2:15:36] his mind of a
[2:15:37] people you see Cain's worship will give
[2:15:41] you a new face and the pretense of a
[2:15:44] good heart with sin nature still Abiding
[2:15:48] and then things don't go your way you
[2:15:51] kill your brother
[2:15:53] that's Abel's worship will give you a
[2:15:56] new heart and a soul that's free and
[2:15:59] clean of sin
[2:16:02] nature brother brandham says in the
[2:16:05] message this is 1961 mark of the beast
[2:16:09] you got a soul in there that's worth
[2:16:12] 10,000
[2:16:14] worlds so he said you let the devil cram
[2:16:16] anything down into it and call it
[2:16:18] righteousness and religion instead of
[2:16:21] taking God's right way about it that's
[2:16:23] right your soul is worth 10,000 worlds
[2:16:26] your own body is worth only 84 Cent you
[2:16:30] drag it around sure make sure take care
[2:16:32] of it or you shave it up and you fix it
[2:16:36] upright might dress it up but that's so
[2:16:40] you sure won't dress that just let
[2:16:43] anything drag into that you wants to
[2:16:45] give you a spider in that you'd sue the
[2:16:47] restaurant that gave it to you but a
[2:16:49] church can tell you shake hands with the
[2:16:51] Pastor say you believe in God worship
[2:16:54] that's all you have to
[2:16:56] do if that's right then kanaine was
[2:16:59] right but remember God said to Cain
[2:17:02] worship like your
[2:17:05] brother and you'll do well that's all I
[2:17:08] want I want you to be able to worship
[2:17:11] like they did in the book of
[2:17:13] Acts like they did in the upper room I
[2:17:16] want you to be able to worship like that
[2:17:18] I see what God accepted
[2:17:21] I want you to be able to worship like
[2:17:23] that in spirit and in truth but he says
[2:17:27] Cain didn't want that he didn't want to
[2:17:29] do it that's the way it is today they
[2:17:31] don't want to worship God in spirit and
[2:17:32] Truth they want to go to church and
[2:17:34] worship the way the church says worship
[2:17:37] worship What God Says worship Jesus said
[2:17:40] God is a spirit and they that worship
[2:17:42] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[2:17:44] truth that's right put them together the
[2:17:46] word and the spirit together and if the
[2:17:48] spirit is in the word the word will
[2:17:51] manifest
[2:17:52] itself amen and he said that's exactly
[2:17:56] the reason you see discernments and
[2:17:58] healings and things it's the word made
[2:18:03] manifest now you see you know you want
[2:18:06] to keep a bird in prison unable to fly
[2:18:10] you don't just clip either
[2:18:14] way it don't matter if it's the right
[2:18:16] one or the left one a bird unbalanced is
[2:18:20] unable to fly
[2:18:22] amen so clip either one you know you you
[2:18:26] can you some will clip the
[2:18:29] truth and don't have it they only have
[2:18:33] part of it and a little bit enough of it
[2:18:34] you can just flop around in a circle
[2:18:36] maybe they got a lot of
[2:18:39] Spirit and the other will have will will
[2:18:42] have truth and let that grow out but
[2:18:44] they'll clip the wings of the
[2:18:46] spirit it takes two wings to fly
[2:18:51] there's two elements to the worship it's
[2:18:54] you see it's supernatural two wings to
[2:18:56] fly they they're not clipped with them
[2:18:58] we can fly in the heavenlies and we can
[2:19:02] get Supernatural Revelation it's a place
[2:19:04] where all things are possible amen when
[2:19:08] you see a church when you see a person
[2:19:11] with unclipped wings they can soar into
[2:19:16] the Realms of the
[2:19:18] supernatural amen they can see
[2:19:22] by the spirit of Revelation the end that
[2:19:24] has coming into this world and know that
[2:19:27] he's made a way of
[2:19:29] Escape what is our way of Escape we are
[2:19:33] eagles amen a eagle don't have to worry
[2:19:36] about crossing the river he flies right
[2:19:39] over it we are a people that will fly
[2:19:42] right over death into the arms of our
[2:19:45] beloved amen but you have to do that
[2:19:48] with two wings and must be
[2:19:57] balanced you want to keep a bird pin
[2:20:00] clip a
[2:20:03] wing combining human reasoning and
[2:20:05] quotes of Truth together without
[2:20:07] considering the whole matter can clip
[2:20:11] Wings you stack them up and make you a
[2:20:14] mount
[2:20:16] gism make make you a you stack them up
[2:20:19] make your Mountain I here's where it's
[2:20:22] got to be if your Scholastic conclusion
[2:20:26] caus you to teach Mercy is over then
[2:20:30] there will be no burden for the
[2:20:33] Lost no altar call
[2:20:39] given come on that may be built on parts
[2:20:43] of truth but the spirit of it is
[2:20:47] wrong the real spirit is is Lord I don't
[2:20:52] want to see nobody
[2:20:54] lost so I sure ain't going to try to
[2:20:56] close the door of
[2:20:58] Mercy amen some guy told me you know one
[2:21:01] time he said now I'll tell you what
[2:21:03] brother Tim he said I had a personal
[2:21:05] revelation I said you did yeah he said I
[2:21:09] had a revelation you know brother Bram
[2:21:10] talked about a time in souls in prison
[2:21:12] now you know there be a time without
[2:21:14] Mercy well it wasn't then but in the
[2:21:17] year
[2:21:18] 2000 in the year 2000 God revealed to
[2:21:22] me this is a pastor of 300 people two
[2:21:26] 300 God revealed to
[2:21:31] me that Mercy now
[2:21:34] over I said oh he
[2:21:37] did I said why would you want to believe
[2:21:41] that I said don't you realize what that
[2:21:43] would do I would damn your children damn
[2:21:47] your grandchildren it damn people that
[2:21:49] was out don't you realize what that does
[2:21:52] that kind of Doctrine does that kind of
[2:21:55] teaching don't you realize oh oh no no
[2:21:58] everybody I
[2:21:59] love and that loves me is going to be
[2:22:03] there so in other words if they love
[2:22:07] me I can get them in so now salvation
[2:22:11] comes in a man and you know what I said
[2:22:14] I said oh you know what I'm going to do
[2:22:17] glory to God I'm going to start loving
[2:22:19] everybody
[2:22:22] I'm going to love everybody I see and
[2:22:24] I'm going to tell them Jesus saved Jesus
[2:22:26] is deliver I'm going to let them know
[2:22:28] there's still a baptism of the Holy
[2:22:30] Ghost there's the power of God in the
[2:22:32] Salvation I'm going to love him that
[2:22:37] much so I just I'm just going to love
[2:22:40] more than what I ever did cuz I want
[2:22:42] everybody to make
[2:22:46] it if your academic knowledge cause you
[2:22:51] to believe days of Miracles are passed
[2:22:53] it was only for the Divine Healing
[2:22:56] movement so only for brother
[2:22:59] brandham there will be no faith when we
[2:23:02] pray for the
[2:23:05] sick this turns us into a powerless
[2:23:07] group of people whose only weapon is
[2:23:12] argument now let me just tell you about
[2:23:14] this message this message of Truth began
[2:23:19] in the spirit
[2:23:21] right how can you end without the
[2:23:25] spirit if it began with the spirit how
[2:23:28] can you end without it the mysteries of
[2:23:31] God that we hold dear of seven Thunders
[2:23:35] utter their
[2:23:36] voices revealing things other ages
[2:23:39] didn't know of the church ages of the
[2:23:42] mysteries of God of of of of
[2:23:47] understanding that we have had in this
[2:23:48] day these mystery
[2:23:51] did not come by academic scholar
[2:23:55] Scholastic learning it came by the
[2:23:59] Supernatural That's right so how then
[2:24:02] can we accept it today as just being a
[2:24:05] fleshly intellectual gospel I'll tell
[2:24:08] you what that is that is a bewitching
[2:24:13] spirit turn with me to Galatians 3 and
[2:24:15] verse one oh foolish Galatians who hath
[2:24:19] Bewitched you that you should not obey
[2:24:22] the truth you see it's a bewitching
[2:24:25] spirit it's a spirit of
[2:24:28] divination it's not the holy ghost at
[2:24:30] all it's leading you to different
[2:24:33] conclusions amen listen listen who has
[2:24:36] Bewitched you that you should not obey
[2:24:38] the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ
[2:24:41] has been evidently set forth crucified
[2:24:44] among you only this only what I learn of
[2:24:46] you I want to know this did you receive
[2:24:49] the Spirit by The Works of the Lord law
[2:24:50] or by the hearing of
[2:24:52] Faith are you so foolish having begun
[2:24:55] the spirit are you now made perfect by
[2:24:56] the flesh have you suffered so many
[2:24:59] things in vain if yet be in vain he that
[2:25:02] ministered to you the
[2:25:04] spirit and worth Miracle among you do he
[2:25:07] by The Works of the law or by the
[2:25:09] hearing of Faith so here again how can
[2:25:12] you say how can you begin with the
[2:25:15] spirit and then end without
[2:25:17] it you we begun in this Spirit we begun
[2:25:21] with the
[2:25:22] supernatural this message is the most
[2:25:26] Supernatural message that has ever been
[2:25:29] given since the
[2:25:31] restoration amen the restoration all the
[2:25:34] way back to the first church it is the
[2:25:37] most Supernatural message was was that
[2:25:41] message Supernatural back there Jesus
[2:25:43] born of a virgin
[2:25:45] Supernatural amen raised from the dead
[2:25:48] Supernatural ascended in Glory
[2:25:51] Supernatural Holy Ghost set back
[2:25:54] Supernatural was it a supernatural
[2:25:56] gospel then amen then there got to be a
[2:25:59] supernatural in the end time if it began
[2:26:02] if the gospel began with a supernatural
[2:26:05] it has to end with the
[2:26:12] supernatural how in the world you think
[2:26:15] by the flesh or by our thinking or by
[2:26:18] our rationale are we going to change our
[2:26:20] body the change of our body will come by
[2:26:24] a supernatural sweep of the Holy Ghost a
[2:26:28] dynic infilling of the spirit of
[2:26:35] God it will not come by the reasoning
[2:26:38] and the intellect of man or figuring out
[2:26:40] or stacking our quotes it'll come by the
[2:26:43] moving of the Holy Ghost
[2:26:51] we have received the word and it's in
[2:26:53] full effect I say it's in full effect it
[2:26:56] will heal it will save it will
[2:27:00] deliver amen it will Rapture it'll
[2:27:03] change your body it will deliver you I
[2:27:06] don't care how long you've been in sin I
[2:27:08] don't care the habits that you had I
[2:27:11] don't care how long you've been a slave
[2:27:13] amen it comes in full effect the word we
[2:27:17] have received is in full effect
[2:27:23] it's denominations that are ceasing
[2:27:26] we're not ceasing no we have been pled
[2:27:29] in the full effect in the full
[2:27:32] effect this message began with an angel
[2:27:35] preaching the gap between the natural
[2:27:37] and the supernatural when he broke
[2:27:40] through the
[2:27:41] Realms of of the supernatural in the
[2:27:44] form of a sual of Supernatural life a
[2:27:48] light
[2:27:51] I don't care how ridiculous it may
[2:27:53] seem how foreign it is to the
[2:27:57] intellect there is another
[2:28:01] realm and it's where God
[2:28:05] dwells we know the realm of demons it's
[2:28:08] manifesting people on the Earth but
[2:28:11] there's also a people manifesting the
[2:28:13] realm of Heaven the perfect love that is
[2:28:16] there has come into their heart by the
[2:28:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost and they have
[2:28:21] that basic element of God and I just say
[2:28:23] release
[2:28:25] it release it Let It
[2:28:29] Go amen allow the spirit to work allow
[2:28:32] it to bring forgiveness to bring
[2:28:37] pardon cause you to love one
[2:28:41] another standing was it a cave was it a
[2:28:45] room a cabin I don't really care
[2:28:48] probably happened in both places
[2:28:52] multiple
[2:28:53] incidences where a light comes
[2:28:58] in where light comes
[2:29:03] in two feet come out of that
[2:29:07] light then legs then a body then a man
[2:29:11] six foot
[2:29:14] tall from that other realm from the
[2:29:17] supernatural
[2:29:21] God still sends things
[2:29:24] supernaturally I defy that spirit that
[2:29:26] says he doesn't in the last days I'll
[2:29:29] pour out my spirit upon All Flesh my
[2:29:33] sons and my daughters shall
[2:29:35] prophesy that's from that realm that's
[2:29:38] supernaturally my sons and daughter they
[2:29:40] will see old men will dream dreams young
[2:29:43] men will see Vision that's
[2:29:49] Supernatural and out of that form of the
[2:29:51] supernatural light stepped a
[2:29:54] man started with the
[2:29:56] supernatural it will end with a
[2:30:00] supernatural with a light coming for you
[2:30:04] to step
[2:30:08] into
[2:30:10] Hallelujah Hallelujah with a light
[2:30:13] coming from
[2:30:14] you and out of that light will step your
[2:30:18] theophany body
[2:30:20] you look and said that's me you'll take
[2:30:23] a step toward it and it'll step toward
[2:30:25] you and you will Embrace each other and
[2:30:27] you'll become one and chain in a moment
[2:30:30] in a twinkle it began with the
[2:30:32] supernatural it will end with the
[2:30:35] [Applause]
[2:30:46] supernatural the ministry of Elijah
[2:30:49] began with super
[2:30:50] natural it ended with a charot of fire
[2:30:59] Supernatural Elis began with the
[2:31:01] supernatural it ended with the
[2:31:03] supernatural the resurrection of a man
[2:31:06] throat on his bones yes
[2:31:11] sir all the way through Jesus life was
[2:31:15] Supernatural it began in the
[2:31:17] Supernatural it ended in the
[2:31:19] Supernatural
[2:31:21] what am I trying to tell you friends I'm
[2:31:23] telling you God did not bring this in
[2:31:26] word only but in power in much
[2:31:30] Assurance amen it will not end without
[2:31:33] power we must have that power it is that
[2:31:36] Holy Ghost Power amen amen I think about
[2:31:41] brother brandham as he stood there after
[2:31:43] the angel came to him and he would Shock
[2:31:46] the World by ripping the thin veil
[2:31:49] between science and the
[2:31:52] Supernatural and his ministry didn't
[2:31:54] Bless but in many instan it it actually
[2:32:01] terrified there standing in Los Angeles
[2:32:04] is account of a man with cancer he
[2:32:07] stands in the line for hours waiting for
[2:32:09] his
[2:32:10] turn and he Witnesses every kind of
[2:32:13] healing
[2:32:14] imaginable so now he knows it can be
[2:32:18] done however when his his time for
[2:32:21] prayer the Evangelist
[2:32:25] says no I won't pray for
[2:32:28] you well he was angry he demanded to
[2:32:32] know
[2:32:33] why brother brandham said you don't want
[2:32:37] me to tell you and he demanded angrily
[2:32:41] refused to leave I'm not leaving here
[2:32:43] I've come I waited in my turn and I'm
[2:32:45] now I demand an
[2:32:47] answer said you're sleeping with your
[2:32:52] secretary with that is the man dropped
[2:32:55] his head and rushed out of the
[2:32:57] meeting this happened over and
[2:33:00] again brother brandham was the answer to
[2:33:03] the desperate prayer and the
[2:33:05] act of the love of God in the
[2:33:09] Pentecostal meeting movement was now
[2:33:12] fragmented
[2:33:14] infighting dying because of immorality
[2:33:18] and because of infight
[2:33:21] it had fallen into
[2:33:22] disrepute many other meetings was just
[2:33:25] fraught with emotionalism and charlatans
[2:33:27] whipped up the audience into frenzies
[2:33:29] and and and most healing testimonies
[2:33:32] were sketchy at
[2:33:35] least things were bad outside the
[2:33:38] church it was a time when America was in
[2:33:41] the grip of Fear of a nuclear war oh
[2:33:44] we're closer now than we ever
[2:33:46] was thing about it is psychiatry was
[2:33:50] replacing
[2:33:52] Faith whole generation was racing away
[2:33:55] from God as it continued to do today
[2:33:58] preachers were at loss as to what to do
[2:34:00] about it and in that
[2:34:03] moment in that moment in a time of
[2:34:08] 1946 enters William brandom onto the
[2:34:13] stage his atmosphere was all together
[2:34:16] different he didn't come out with the
[2:34:18] Fanfare of or Roberts who would come out
[2:34:22] of his tent from a little box in the
[2:34:24] back and he comes tring out with his
[2:34:26] Bible being pronounced as the man of the
[2:34:30] hour oh
[2:34:32] Roberts he didn't come out as AA Allen
[2:34:37] often times
[2:34:39] drunk with the excess of
[2:34:43] alcohol he came out totally different
[2:34:46] without Showmanship or fanfare
[2:34:50] made no attempt to manipulate the
[2:34:54] people but when he tells the audience
[2:34:57] he's
[2:34:58] here the angel of Lord is
[2:35:01] present that would be a statement so
[2:35:04] posos so
[2:35:06] stunning
[2:35:08] so yet it
[2:35:10] was then that astounding things started
[2:35:13] to happen Miracle after Miracle all
[2:35:17] Roberts would testify of them and these
[2:35:19] are public
[2:35:20] documentations that you can find said
[2:35:22] there was no hard cases for brother Bram
[2:35:25] while he was enveloped with the by the
[2:35:27] anointing growth vanished limbless limbs
[2:35:31] lifeless limbs awaken and blind eyes
[2:35:34] open what was we
[2:35:37] seeing we were seeing an Elijah Ministry
[2:35:41] stepping
[2:35:42] forth not to bring another
[2:35:46] Reformation that's why he never joined
[2:35:49] one of the their churches he wasn't sent
[2:35:51] to reform them that's
[2:35:55] right amen he was sent for the purpose
[2:35:58] of
[2:36:01] restoration and there's a huge
[2:36:03] difference between Reformation we've had
[2:36:05] re reforms down to The Times They
[2:36:08] reformed the Catholic church and
[2:36:09] produced Lutheran they reformed the
[2:36:11] Lutheran and produced Wesley and they
[2:36:13] all one who is reforming this and
[2:36:14] reforming that and adjusting this
[2:36:16] Doctrine and that and make all of their
[2:36:20] Mount
[2:36:23] gism but God wasn't
[2:36:26] interested in reforming and
[2:36:29] remaking and may taking one of them and
[2:36:31] making it the Great Mighty place of
[2:36:35] worship because that was never God's
[2:36:38] place of worship His place of worship
[2:36:41] was in Christ
[2:36:46] Jesus so a restoration was beginning
[2:36:50] the Pentecostals didn't want to accept
[2:36:52] him as having the Elijah
[2:36:55] anointing because they only wanted to
[2:36:57] reform and grow their denomination that
[2:36:59] was their goal it was never an interest
[2:37:02] of them to be a
[2:37:05] restoration but a
[2:37:08] reformation and yet the prophecy said as
[2:37:11] John the Baptist and and you know it was
[2:37:14] said again and again even by theusa
[2:37:17] Pentecostals themselves they would speak
[2:37:18] in tongues and brother bradam could come
[2:37:21] and stood at hou Houston Texas Man rises
[2:37:24] up he's dressed like a cowboy he rises
[2:37:27] up and he speaks in a tongues and
[2:37:29] another guy you jumps up and he he
[2:37:32] interprets it and his interpretation is
[2:37:35] as John the Baptist was sent to forun
[2:37:39] the first coming of Christ you're sent
[2:37:40] with a message to forun the second
[2:37:44] coming it would be asked do you know
[2:37:47] each other no we've never met you spoke
[2:37:49] tell you and do you know no we don't
[2:37:52] know have you ever met this man never
[2:37:54] heard of him till today and I come to
[2:37:56] this meeting and hear the spirit of God
[2:37:59] spoke what was he saying that there was
[2:38:02] a way to be prepared for the
[2:38:06] Messiah amen and we can say it this way
[2:38:09] but not just for the total fulfillment
[2:38:12] of the coming of Christ but the word to
[2:38:15] be restored Christ the word the truth to
[2:38:19] come
[2:38:22] back it would be a
[2:38:25] restoration not a
[2:38:28] Reformation he would not be the creating
[2:38:31] of another Harlot daughter that's never
[2:38:33] been his
[2:38:34] intentions God's intentions is to get a
[2:38:37] bride a spotless
[2:38:42] bride time after time this would happen
[2:38:45] an
[2:38:46] aater who was in the meetings that I was
[2:38:49] in as a boy there and her name was known
[2:38:52] all through the Pentecostal circles she
[2:38:54] had the same prophecy stood up in the
[2:38:57] meetings and prophesied as John the
[2:39:01] Baptist stood right there Tommy Osburn
[2:39:05] he said it in his witness he said I
[2:39:07] heard it deep down within my soul as I
[2:39:09] sat and listened to brother brandham in
[2:39:11] those first Services there in in
[2:39:14] 19467 and he said I heard it down deep
[2:39:16] in my soul it was a voice resonating
[2:39:19] with my bosom as John the Baptist was
[2:39:23] sent to forun the first coming of Christ
[2:39:26] I want you to know this message came
[2:39:30] Vindicated by the supernatural God
[2:39:32] himself that's right amen and he and he
[2:39:36] and so you say well you know they would
[2:39:38] later say well that was his fault that's
[2:39:40] why he died he made himself Elijah they
[2:39:43] said he was Elijah that's
[2:39:46] right their prophecy said he was
[2:39:50] Elijah they said how do you say that
[2:39:52] they said he was John the Baptist
[2:39:54] because Luke 1:17 and he shall go before
[2:39:57] him in the spirit and power of Elias
[2:39:59] this is John the Baptist to turn the
[2:40:01] hearts of the father their children to
[2:40:03] Disobedience uh to the wisdom of the
[2:40:05] just to make ready a people prepared for
[2:40:08] the Lord that's what God has done in
[2:40:10] this
[2:40:12] generation Hallelujah all we need to do
[2:40:15] is look at Elijah and realize as a
[2:40:17] prophecy what we must do he turned and
[2:40:20] rebuilt the place of
[2:40:23] worship and gathered the stones that had
[2:40:26] been scattered the Loose Ends that had
[2:40:29] been left out and abandoned truth that
[2:40:32] had been neglected and built an altar
[2:40:35] and laid Jesus Christ the sacrifice as
[2:40:38] the focal
[2:40:41] point Hallelujah are you with me and
[2:40:43] what happened the fire
[2:40:45] fell how did we know how did they know
[2:40:49] how do they know that God had answered
[2:40:51] fire fell that's how do we know God
[2:40:54] answered in this day fire
[2:40:56] fell amen sign after sign and wonder
[2:41:00] after wonder and it was never wrong
[2:41:03] never wrong never wrong it showed it was
[2:41:06] the spirit of
[2:41:12] Truth the stones must be in altar be in
[2:41:15] order the altar rebuilt
[2:41:19] we must preach a Bible
[2:41:22] Jesus a Bible Holiness and a Bible
[2:41:26] Doctrine but I want you to understand
[2:41:29] when the fire fell it consumed all the
[2:41:33] stones it did not leave a place in
[2:41:38] Jeffersonville for everybody to
[2:41:41] worship it didn't leave a place in
[2:41:44] Tucson it didn't leave an altar here or
[2:41:47] there it consumed it all and all was
[2:41:49] left was the
[2:41:52] fire Hallelujah there it is that's where
[2:41:56] our place of worship is is where he
[2:42:00] is where he is where the fire is that's
[2:42:04] our place of
[2:42:05] worship hallelujah amen God did not
[2:42:08] leave us a bunch of things there for us
[2:42:11] just to fuss and fight over but for us
[2:42:13] to see one thing the fire is here the
[2:42:17] Holy Ghost is here and that light is
[2:42:19] here to take a pride in a
[2:42:24] Rapture hallelujah amen this is his
[2:42:28] [Applause]
[2:42:31] promise this
[2:42:33] morning in the we hours of the
[2:42:36] morning I was awakened by the Holy
[2:42:40] Spirit and he brought me to this
[2:42:44] place right here of Elisha standing at
[2:42:49] the
[2:42:53] River School of prophets were there
[2:42:56] watching they're scoffing ridicule
[2:42:59] wondering doubting that God was with the
[2:43:05] Elisha I wouldn't have time to go into
[2:43:08] it maybe it'll be subject for another
[2:43:10] day I have probably another as long a
[2:43:14] time to spend on Elijah and
[2:43:17] Elisha and following them
[2:43:21] taking them through the steps of their
[2:43:24] Journey from Dothan to the school of the
[2:43:28] prophets to the Jordan brother brandham
[2:43:31] types it with justification and
[2:43:35] sanctification Aus a movement and they
[2:43:37] said then into the supernatural into the
[2:43:40] new
[2:43:43] land and I just want to say as I waken
[2:43:48] this morning
[2:43:49] I awakened and I thought what is the end
[2:43:53] of all of
[2:43:54] this where does it all come down
[2:43:58] to and Elijah of course would tell
[2:44:01] Elisha if you see me go
[2:44:04] away that's the only way you're going to
[2:44:06] get the double
[2:44:08] portion and you see it was in Jesus
[2:44:11] going away that he sent back the double
[2:44:13] portion which is the baptism of the Holy
[2:44:16] Ghost which allows the church to do the
[2:44:19] Greater Works or have the double
[2:44:25] portion
[2:44:29] now I thought how did it all end
[2:44:34] up it all ended up with a chariot of
[2:44:41] fire horses of
[2:44:43] fire something breaking from The
[2:44:47] Immortal realms
[2:44:49] coming into this
[2:44:52] Dimension and Elijah stepped into that
[2:44:56] Whirlwind and went
[2:44:59] up I want you to
[2:45:06] know I want you to know the charot
[2:45:08] fixtion to come for
[2:45:13] us this
[2:45:15] time it will be Jesus
[2:45:19] and we will meet him in the
[2:45:21] air and we will step into the realm of
[2:45:24] where he is and be chased in a moment
[2:45:27] and a twinkling of an
[2:45:31] eye true worship is not in a place true
[2:45:36] worships in a man Christ Jesus and he is
[2:45:40] the spirit and if I can get you in the
[2:45:43] spirit with the truth that you have you
[2:45:47] will have true worship and the fire will
[2:45:50] come down and consume your sacrifice
[2:45:53] answer your prayer and deliver
[2:45:56] you that's his promise it is the hour of
[2:46:01] true worship other worships are counted
[2:46:04] over with but we have entered into
[2:46:10] worship
[2:46:14] Hallelujah and as we
[2:46:17] stand this this time that's right as we
[2:46:21] stand this time it will not
[2:46:26] be Elijah going
[2:46:29] up but it'll be the Elisha given the
[2:46:32] double
[2:46:34] portion who will go up
[2:46:38] chain from Mortal to immortality
[2:46:50] friends don't stay at these other
[2:46:53] places they might be great things of
[2:46:57] justification where you receive pardon
[2:46:59] for your
[2:47:00] sin they may be great works of
[2:47:03] sanctification where you got cleansed of
[2:47:06] habits you might get it on your spirit
[2:47:08] and you shouting down the
[2:47:10] aisle but
