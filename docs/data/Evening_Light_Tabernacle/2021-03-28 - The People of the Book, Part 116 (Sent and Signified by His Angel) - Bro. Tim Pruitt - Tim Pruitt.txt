in the house miracles in this house deliverance for your people lord that the chains of darkness will be taken off of lives and there will be a deliverance among your people everywhere even those that are under the sound of my voice that'll be streaming in those that can't be here for one reason or another lord those that are in outline areas those that are are elderly among us that aren't able to come and they're shut in lord i pray that you'll meet their need i pray that you'll speak to them in a very special way lord they're they're not doing this because of on their own pleasure or their own likings but because of their age because of of ailments in their body and i just pray god you'll reach out lord you'll reach out to those outlying areas down in manning where the stankies are up in arkansas where the hollis's are lord the different other places around the world wherever they are the shut-ins are sick the needy lord may have message come to them today that you're here among us delivering your people and i pray lord that we'll see that satan like lightnings falls from heaven you'll give us triumphant triumph and power over every enemy to tread upon every serpent in jesus name amen amen god bless you let's turn to revelation chapter one and we read from verse one this morning revelation chapter 1 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave to him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john who bear record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw amen god bless you you can be seated amen last week i was at a wedding isaiah pruitt got married to melody green and they're now happily married and we was able to go and perform that wedding i want to thank you those of you that were with me and who attended service with us and blessed us with your presence there as we spoke to the group there um brother bryce collins and in claremore oklahoma we had a wonderful time in the lord together there some really great time of fellowship and we certainly appreciated the presence of god coming down we had literally saw prodigals come home amen and we saw others that reconsecrated their life to god and others who received a miracle of healing or deliverance god was with us and then of course i listened to the service sunday and i tell you wouldn't want to miss that for the world amen we were blessed abundantly by brother aaron's ministry and this week coming up we'll have some very special guests as we will have um brother um brother danny steeman brother andrew spencer that is the ones that we have announced that will be here to minister here and and we're just looking for a great time in the lord and believing god's going to do miraculous things amen so we won't have a wednesday night service but we will have um starting friday at 7 and then 11 and um what time we making that five is it on on on saturday and um and then we'll have it eleven again on sunday so got some just some power pack meetings coming up and i'll tell you what if you'll just empty yourself out god will fill you up amen just find a little more of yourself and your own will and your own pride and your own ambitions your own any kind of sin any kind of darkness let the lord just deal with you amen empty up so that you can receive a lot amen i believe that we're going to receive something very packed down and filled up and overflowing and speaking of that we are expecting an overflowing crowd and so um we have tried to keep this median not not really announced because we are just trying to keep the numbers limited but the good news is before all this even came into materialize in the meeting kim we had the governor uh lift all the restrictions on religious meetings so we can have as many as we can get in here amen and i just pray that the lord will send those who he for for ordained amen we're not asking for any more to come but we are saying that those that come we're we're hoping to accommodate them amen and we're looking for a good time in the lord my what a mighty god we serve when i think of what he's doing when i think about his healing power and how he's healing and the expectation of his people rising and when i think about the satanic forces and the evil that is coming to our country and to our land and the increase of darkness upon the earth it means that the holy spirit is lifting from the earth the bible said he that now let us will let until he be taken out of the way and of course he be in the holy spirit which brother branham said he even translated that is he or she be taken out of the way speaking of the bride because when the bride leaves she leaves as the holy spirit leaves you don't want to be left here you want to be a part of the ascending amen as we see a world that is falling a falling world of fallen nature fallen man we want to be a part of those that are ascending amen in your experience you should pray lord help me to rise up a little higher amen to you know to to um to move into realms beyond word that you've ever walked before and let god um take you on an enoch's walk where you take another step higher another realm higher this is a walk and so it is a step by step and wherever you are don't be don't be happy where you're at and some of you maybe came to repentance just the other day i'm looking out here seeing christian amen come to repentance the other day it's a great move wonderful thing good great move that you made toward god but don't stop there amen wherever you are in your walk don't stop there it's not a stopping place don't put a period keep moving amen and asking god to do more in your life amen i don't care if you've been a holy ghost field person for 50 years been in the message for 50 years and embraces truth asked god for a renewal of the holy ghost amen i have a greater expectation for more than what you've ever received the experience that you had to be a greater experience expect to see the angel of god expect to witness his presence expect to see the pillar of fire expect to receive the pillar of fire amen expect him to come and move over your life and separate you from darkness or sickness or disease or whatever it is come with a great expectation and we do that with every service ain't no telling what would happen amen and i believe that people are i believe our level of expectation is rising you sure realizing it's not time to play church anymore but it's time to really get serious with god amen and so you know i i we just had a man here this week that drove all the way up from indiana and came when the services with us because he's hungry and then he sees that there's something that that that you have that he doesn't have and he's a pastor of a little church but he wants more of god and i say glory to god for that amen may god move on the hungry hearts no matter where they are and stir those hearts and bring that bride to attention as i said you might have been in the message for 40 years 50 years whatever it's been you know that you don't get any gold medals for that be many of them left behind that started out and they they they relaxed and got cold and got indifferent got indifference toward god and that shows up in your your attendance to church your attitude toward christ your it shows up in every aspect of your christian walk so i'm just i'm just encouraging you to step up today and to look into the promise today we're going to be speaking on sent and signified by his angel if you noticed in the book of revelation it told us that he sent and signified or made it known by his angel unto his servant john if you look at that word signified you see part of it is sign is the first part of that word signified so that words it means that that it that there is a sign that is sent by his angel he sent and signified it by his angel you see it wouldn't do moses any good to go down and say an angel appeared to me in a burning bush unless he had a sign proving it it wouldn't do any good for william branham to come and say god met me when an angel of god stepped out of a light unless that there were signs that followed that proved that the angel was present now and so again it was is he sent and signified it by his angel and and the book of revelation was brought to john by the angel it was the revelation of jesus christ of sent and made known by his angel this is very important that you look at this because throughout the bible it was the angel that brought the word of god to the prophets the bible is god's inspired words sent and signified by his angel the bible would say um that the scriptures were written as the men of god were moved by the holy ghost so we have returned to the homeland this is what we have been speaking about for some time now the return back to the homeland and in this homeland of the bible it is a place where the word of god is revealed by the angel to the prophet amen how different we are from denominations who look to their headquarters and their schools of divinity as their alma mater you know almanac module is a latin word for blessed mother the thing that provides nourishment and so unlike denominations our alma mater is the bible and if we're going to understand the symbols in the book of revelation it will have to be made known to us by the same angel that brought it to john are you with me amen now we're not able to ask john what was it that the thunder's uttered we need to know we're here in the end time and john we need to know we're not able to ask him that because john we know has been dead long ago and so again but but the angel that brought the message is still here amen the mighty angel swore in revelation 10 that it would not always be shrouded in mystery in fact the angel has been seen in that scripture of revelation 10 is viewed with his hand raised toward the heavens and he is swearing with his hands raised up making a sworn declaration as he swears by himself for he can swear by no one greater and he's invoking by doing this he's invoking all the powers of heaven saying all of heaven is behind this that he himself is the guarantor of the promise that the time of the lame of this mystery is now finished isn't it wonderful we can announce today that we are no longer in the half an hour of silence with the time of silence where god held back mysteries of seven thunders and mysteries of those seals and its symbols and the mysteries of the church ages and the journeys of the church and god held back all of these mysteries but now the time of silence is over amen but we're in a time now where the prayers are being answered where all the prayers that were has been released by the pouring out of the incense and under the seventh seal when the seventh seal is open the incense is poured out upon the altar and mixed with the prayers of the saints no longer are they being held up about his coming john would say even so come lord jesus the prayers of the saints down to the ages have asked for his coming but we're in a day where they are now mixed with incense even when you pray for his coming today they are mixed with the incense off of the altar and they ascend immediately into god's presence because we're living in the age and the time we're not not being held up amen but it's a time where the prayers are now being answered hallelujah he is answering that prayer by reaching out and calling in the prodigal he is reaching out to prayer and answering that prayer by reaching out and finding the last predestinated seed he is answering that prayer by bringing an atmosphere of faith that will heal our bodies so we can believe in the chains of our bodies and god is answering prayer like he's never done in any other generation this is a solemn hour this is a serious time and he says he shows that all of heaven is now behind this promise he swears by him that liveth forever and ever a declaring an oath not going to stop there's not going to be any more delay i'm not going to hold this back for another age i'm not going to withhold from this generation the mysteries of god i'm going to make them known there's going to be a people that know their god and do exploits are you hearing me it means that there's no more delay you're holding back of the finishing of redemption i and the tearing off of the seals that held the book of title closed it's all over having a sealed book is finished amen we're in the day of the unsealed book amen i a promise closed off to us is over with amen because we are now the age we are now the generation for all the mysteries of god to be fulfilled in the people now this message did not come from seminaries or from the guesswork of men it didn't come by probing in the book his brother branham would illustrate it is not the mastermind of theologians instead god is his own interpreter it is being sent and signified by his angel now in the godhead explained brother branham talks about this because we we have come to a time where there's all kinds of what looks like contradictions and one man says us this and another says it that and they're built they have built denominations over every little frivolous things may not realize it but you know there is actually a denomination of the of the of the of the you know over whether adam had a naval or not all kinds of denominations have been formed sex pulling away ideas of man claiming to have the revelation are you with me but these contradictions come up and brother adam said but then i go before god to find out and the same angel that meets me in the meeting in the night is the same one who taught me the godhead all of these contradictions things that are in the bible things that are made known have been sent and signified to us by his angel so that you would not be wondering was this just another man's idea well is this just another man we are following no it is sent and signified by his angel you know why so why come back to the bible is taught by the angel of the covenant because it is the time for the mysteries to be made known in daniel 12 and 9 he said go thy way daniel for the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end many shall be purified and be made wide and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand so he tells us there is an understanding that will come in the last day that will purify the believers are you with me amen not only that but they're closed up and sealed until the end time because it's at the end time that this is all to come to pass and to be made known now you can figure it out how you want to but there has to come an end time there has to come a fulfillment of the promises amen you know he would come crying real slow but sure but they finally it had to come all of the old testament had to head up and that one man jesus and it's ground slow but sure through seven church ages but all the promises has got a head up in a bride are you with me now and down to the old testament it was always the word of god sent and signified by his angel daniel understood by books the number of years that jerusalem would be desolated he could go and read the bible and he could see that the time was near but yet even though he had the book he still needed the touch of the angel in daniel 9 21 yeah while i was speaking in prayer even the man gabriel whom i'd seen in the vision at the beginning caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening oblation and he informed me and talked with me and said oh daniel i am comfort to give thee skill and understanding now notice he had he had books he had the books of jeremiah he had a bible come on amen he can read the bible but he wasn't getting the full understanding he wasn't getting the full purpose of god until he got touched by an angel and when the angel touched him he said i have come to bring you this touch to give you skill and understanding this understanding would come not from the schools in babylon not from the chief of the nebuchadnezzar's team that ruled his ministry and his government and governors it wouldn't come from his educators it would come by the angel this church would illuminate daniel's eyes to things so he would write the book of revelation of the old testament the book of daniel he would record what the angel said now even in the days of jesus it was a logos revealing the word amen i said in the days of jesus it was still the logos the pillar of fire revealing the word the angel of covenant became jesus christ amen for the father the eternal spirit dwelt in the flesh body of jesus christ and it was the father the creator of his body that dwelt in him that taught him he was a man who can say i have been taught by my father my teaching was not a man he said in john 7 16 my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me in john 8 28 but as my father had taught me i speak these things he would speak things not of what he learned from his mother's knee not what wisdom he learned from man even they would marvel and say where did this man get this wisdom he didn't learn this from us it's obvious he don't agree with what we're teaching so he didn't get it from us but where did he get all of this knowledge and jesus answered that my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me as my father taught me i speak these things so the word the logos the pillar of fire the eternal spirit the father gave the message he was the same one who gave the word on mount sinai to moses he was the one who taught doctrine to jesus he's the one who gave it to paul as we've been through it in galatians 1 11 but i certify i guarantee you brethren that the gospel which was preached to me is not after man for neither was i neither i received it a man neither was i taught it but by revelation of jesus christ there in the presence of the pillar of fire in the body form that jesus is now because he's not here on earth in the body form of the man of galilee in that human form but he's here in the form he was in before he became flesh and that is he is here in the form of a pillar of fire and that pillar of fire would meet paul and teach him and he says i got this by revelation this man had never met jesus personally he had never been taught of him on the sea of galilee he had never entered into a fishing boat with him and learned of parables and understanding he had never heard from the lips of jesus like that but he received the gospel pure and true from a pillar of fire and he would write the new testament and he would say i certify you brother i did not even confer with the disciples i didn't learn this from them i learned this in the presence of a pillar of fire and you have a bible today that is written by the pillar of fire [Applause] in the presence of the pillar of fire that light who identified himself as jesus paul wrote these epistles of the new testament and it would be there he would divide law from grace it wasn't that circumcision was done away with it was that the type was fulfilled by the antitype amen that the true circumcision would come of the heart instead of the flesh it wasn't that the sabbath was done away with but that it was no longer a day of the week that you meet but it was now it was now a sabbath rest that you enter into by the baptism of the holy ghost it again it was not that the lamb and the blood of the lamb was no longer needed but now the greater lamb had come amen and so you know it would be paul who would write and he said this is better this is better than what they had there this is a greater prophet because this is the god of the prophet this is a greater than aaron because this is melchizedek this is greater than the law and the priesthood in the arabic priesthood because now we have a priesthood that i never die whoever liveth to make intercession on the behalf of those that seek him now that same pillar of fire that gave the message to moses on mount sinai taught doctrine to jesus and revealed truth to paul and he's the same one who restores the message to the last church age amen now we know there's been a fallen away the scripture bears that there would be a fallen away paul said it he said i fear that the church will do like eve and she will be deceived and beguiled through her subtlety through his subtlety and there she will be she will lose her virginity and john would pick this up and he would see her as a great a fallen woman come on a man who rejected her marriage and and being true to her husband and took in the seeds of other men somebody with me this is the great horror in the book of revelation because the book of revelation is really about two women right when you sum it all up it's really about two women the who started out the first eve who started out a man who fell away and amen god's bride who is a virgin bride a people without spider wrinkle and the marriage of the lamb has come for his wife has made herself ready to women we're in the times of restitution of all things peter would declare this when he would say jesus cannot return until the times of restitution of all things it's the time of restoration to bring us back to the faith that was once delivered to the saints now why not just allow it then to come through a trained revered theologian i mean you know they they have their skills they have their knowledge they have their ideas you know why not just let it come to a train revered theologian because they are the ones who mess it up with human understanding this is why we got the confusion today amen and it didn't take long when the disciples were all gone for them to take in and distort the gospel they were doing it even when paul was there and in fact he would say to the galatians he said who hat be with you amen that you depart from the truth to another gospel who has bewitched you he actually saw it as a bewitching evil spirit that had taken over the church of galatia he would see it already even even john would say ah the antichrist is already among you now paul would see it coming he said i see it as a man of sin sitting in the church in the temple of god and he's showing himself that he is god he's telling everybody that he's god and he's sitting in the temple of god he's a man of sin instead now now of course you know why why not give it to a trained revered theologian because it would break god's design and program of the way he does things amen he never has done it with the theologian ever he sins and signifies it through his angel amen now you know you can argue whether it's angels or not or whether angel ministries or not everybody knows that william branham was was a man who was accompanied by an angel he was set apart from all the other divine healers that he come along as impersonators after him he was set apart because this man had an angel with him amen this man every service the angel would show up this man every service the angel would heal the sick the angel would discern the hearts the angel would tell their addresses and their names and where they come from the angel was present in every meeting because while god was sending and signifying it by his angel amen yes william branham was an earthly angel but that was a greater angel that was with him that said that made him an angel or a messenger you cannot explain it any other way than there was an angel you can take his thoughts and say well they're distortions you can take his thoughts and say they were imagination but when you discern the thoughts of the entrance of heart like no man can do and only the word can do all of that goes out the window all your arguments fade away amen no you know it would break god's design and programming the way he did things that god used a theologian he sends it and signifies it by his angel now so you know it was theologians that turned baptism from the name of jesus to titles it was a gatling church theologian tertilian that changed the truth of the godhead into three persons that god that jesus was one that was in the godhead not as the bible said the fullness of the godhead was in jesus as brother branham said in the first seal i wanted to share this with you brother caylen singh shared this with me last sunday or last week after i preached here he said as we study this chapter we're referring different places but even the old and new testament alike because the entire book is the revelation of jesus christ that is altogether the revelation of the lord jesus the revelation of jesus christ it's god revealing himself in the book revealing himself to christ in the book and christ is the revelation of god he come to reveal god because he and god were the same god was in christ reconciling the world himself in other words you'd never know just what god was until he revealed himself to through christ then you can see i used to think years ago that maybe god was angry with me but christ loved me i'll come to find out it's the same person see christ is the very heart of god now can't you see then why there is a need because we have 40 000 different interpretations of the bible upon which men have denominated all of them taught by man and not one of them not one of them teaching paul's gospel amen so if we're going to have paul's gospel restored again it must be restored by the angel amen by jesus the pillar of fire come on the purify himself it can't come to human understanding of the bible it can't come by simply sitting down and doing a verse by verse study is gonna take a revelation from the angel or it will never become clear are you with me and brother brethren said it's by the help of the angel that the truth of this message was given amen speak to this mountain he said one time i written the bible about hell and i'm beginning to read the word hell comes from the word hades which means the grave and i was about three or four years i wouldn't preach on the subject of hell because one place it looked like a burning fire the next place was the grave until i found the truth of it and then when i got to know exactly what it was and by help of the angel of the lord that revealed it to me because i didn't get any schooling and i just hold on to a scripture and pray and search the scriptures until he comes and reveals it to me when he stands before me in that light that you see on that picture and reveals it it every time is perfect with the scripture through and through that's the reason i know it's the angel lord because he bears record of the word come on now church they made it don't bear record of a denomination but he bears record of the word [Music] amen it agrees with the bible it doesn't matter what it is what we believe comes from the book written by the angel amen this is where it comes from this is where our message amen this was shown to the prophet of god in the bible he didn't use quotes of william branham to prove what he believed amen he used the bible words that were spoken by an angel the prophets down through the ages and that's how he proved what he believed somebody with me now and he said the reason i know his angel of the lord because he bears record of his word and if the angel told me one thing that wasn't scriptural i wouldn't believe him amen it has to be with the word first god's word is eternal it has er because an angel could come pre preach something else paul said it wasn't right but if it's the word of god the angel of god will verify that word every time to be the truth if it's a true angel of from the lord if it's something off of color then don't listen to it but if an angel comes and speaks and says just exactly what the word says then that angel is from god amen now so you see that's why he could talk about he said in the in revelation he said uh series he said what was being revealed what is the revelation of redemption how was we redeemed just look at the past few years and what happened the revelation of the name of the jesus in water baptism is that bible isn't it yes it is the only way anybody ever baptized was in that name amen the revelation of no eternal hell now there is an eternal fire because god is a consuming fire and he's eternal amen but no one will have eternal life in the fire in the lake of fire eternal life is only for believers it's god's own life immortal life so no one can burn eternally in hell they might burn a thousand years ten thousand years there probably will be degrees in health i mean there will probably be some that burn just ten minutes they didn't do much there may be some that burns a thousand years they'll suffer a long time there may be others until the last enemy is destroyed that's death and death and hell will find its place as hell is the grave there death and the grave will find his place in the lake of fire amen and the last enemy will be destroyed and that is death so you see there again he will he will watch he will be there watching all his subjects all his children all the ones that he deceived every to ever all of his kingdom come right down to the end come on you know it's well it's like manasseh in the bible who rebelled against uh babylon and king the king there took him and incarcerated him but he did something else he did and killed all his children all his wife everybody all his all of his leaders he took them and killed them before his eyes then he put his eyes out and the last enemy is going to be destroyed is satan himself and he'll watch every one of his subjects destroyed all of his children burn he'll see everyone that he deceived annihilated the soul that sin of the bible said shall die but he's going to die too he'll be the last he'll burn the longest he'll be tortured the most like manasseh there there they're watching his children die you'll be the last that's right let's go to isaiah 12 just for a minute i wouldn't go and go here but go to isaiah 12. i mean loves the word of god you believe it amen well the book of isaiah tells us of this very same thing isaiah chapter 12 read with me we find hero of lucifer this is the enemy coming down to his end is that isaiah 12. what's what scripture am i looking for hang on just a minute sometimes sometimes you need your glasses hey i'm going to get this hang on just a second i'm going to get it i hope you love the lord today amen because his word is the truth amen isaiah 14 13. here we are isaiah 14 13 for thou hast said in thine heart i will ascend unto heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit upon the mount of the congregation and the sides of the north now here's what he says i'm going to sit in the church the church will be my church the the i'll be be in the mountain of the congregation besides the north in mount zion and the sides of the north is the city of the great king the psalmist said and satan says i'm going to take the church and i'm going to rule from there i'll sit on the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north next verse i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high you see this one you see the self-exaltation you see this one rising up trying to put itself above everything look at him now this angel who does it who falls from his estate because this rising causes fall to become a devil the next verse he said yea thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit amen next verse and they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the earth to tremble that did shake the kingdoms look back at that verse again they that see thee some gnarly look upon me i'm going to be there that devil that is called sickness that devil is caused pain that devil that caused divorces and families and ruined her and her family that that took and pushed alcohol and joke and every other filthy things and prostitution and all the evil in the world that devil of politics amen that devil that caused all the strife and all the trouble in the world one day you're going to stand on the prank and look down upon him and look gnarly and consider and say is this the man is this the one that caused the sickness and this trouble and separated children about sin and wickedness is that's the one [Applause] that made the earth to tremble that did shake the kingdom that made the world a wilderness that destroyed the cities thereof and all the kings listen is this the one you see we're gonna have the last life might as well go to laughing now because you're going to have the last one too come on now amen the revelation of no eternal hell he said never was known before thinking your loved ones would be would be for eternal you can't have eternal life unless you're saved you've got eternal life then you can't be burned in hell for eternal you you can be punished you'll be punished for your sins with your natural life but you're not you cannot have eternal life in hell you've got eternal life then you cannot burn forever because there's only one form of eternal life and i'm sure the church understands that now what is it what other things a plan of redemption just look what's been given to us lately by the holy spirit see abraham seed what the revelation meant the serpent seed see the book of revelation watch when we get to it how it just peels off and i proved it by the scripture that's exactly the truth i go plumb back in genesis and pick it up and show when that seal opened it come right back through the bible from genesis to revelation and just think from genesis to revelation there was nobody baptized in the name of father and son and the holy ghost is a false baptism we're talking about things that was revealed by the angel it's not hard to see about water baptism even brother branham even said in the church these books don't require revelation it's so written plainly in the bible how to baptize because there's not one example in the bible where anyone was ever baptizing titles of father son and holy ghost every person that was baptized in the bible where baptism was obliged was baptized in the name of jesus christ and the serpent seed has been from genesis people want to talk about the serpency what we believe let me tell you that was taught by an angel come on and the angel was there he knew what the sin in the garden was exactly right when he said i'll put enmity between you and the serpent seed you can't deny that there's a serpent see the bible said there is one i'll put enmity between you eve at the woman's seed and the serpent seed is that right amen so if the serpent seed was a myth so is christ a myth because he was at seed amen and so so is the church a myth see it's you can't separate the serpent out of seed and that's the one that really staggers them why they can't understand it because they don't have the revelation of it and he said why won't they come and argue with me pulpits open all the time i'd meet anybody i wouldn't argue with them but i sure discuss it with them if they want i i've asked them to come before the association i i i asked him right there before the association i want some of you to tell me where it's wrong don't stand off in the corner and talk about me about it come up to my face and stand let's have it real let's come up here and let's see who's right and wrong on but they won't tackle it frankly he says they know better cause not me but it's the holy spirit that very angel of god that you see what about these days here when all these things taken place and this age of the lord standing near i wouldn't know these things but it's the hour it's here and when we get through those seven spirits of seven horns and things today if the lord will and you'll see where it's at it's the hour that we're that these revelations are supposed to come it's the book of revelation the revealing of jesus christ and we find out the very first chapter he revealed who he was he's getting those seven seals revealing how he redeemed the earth one of them was by the name of jesus christ the other was taking the fear out of the people like eternal redemption um justification by faith the sanctification the baptism of the holy spirit amen like we sang today there's a name written in glory and it's mine but when was it wrote come on amen not when you come down the altar but before the foundational world he wrote your name there amen god chose you then i'm glad he did it because you see something i could have done might have got his disfavor and he would unchoose me but god did it before the world began he chose me knowing i was a sinner he chose me knowing my fault he chose me with my situations that i had to go through he chose me before the foundation of the world for i breathe the first breath he chose me and he ordained me to be an overcomer [Music] so therefore we're eternally secured hallelujah amen taking all the doubts away from the people god wants you to be sure of your salvation if you've got the earnest of your salvation god has already sealed you to the day of redemption amen ephesians 4 30 says grieve not the holy spirit of god where you're sealed unto the day of redemption now listen many many things that we could talk about the angel the angel the angel the angel the angel revealed but let me tell you something even after this list of things that he just went through god wasn't finished that's right in the book of revelation there are seven spirits of god or seven manifestations of one holy spirit represented by the seven spirits of god there would be in our day are you with me supernatural things that would happen this is a time that heaven is opened that things from that from the dimensions there are happening in these dimensions here that heaven is coming down amen to bring a bride out of here so the seven mighty angels would come from glory representing the seven spirits of god notice when john saw the book it was a closed book it was sealed tight with seven seals but the lamb in heaven has moved by taking the book and loosened the seals in order to bring about the fullness of redemption so that there could be a rapture so you're living in a day where the angels of god are concerned about this generation about you living here in this time and he's come to touch your life amen in some ways every one of you have been touched by the angel maybe maybe not you personally but your family that's why you're here your mama your dad your brother your sister somebody was touched by that angel and came back and witnessed to you i have been touched and i have been given wisdom and understanding that i could not get from a denomination hallelujah amen the seals being opened in order to bring the fullness of redemption now what if we just had another theologian with another chart or just a book written by a smart educated man well first of all if he was from yale then harvard wouldn't receive any man if he was from this one loyola did at vinity college then he wouldn't be received by the methodist and if he had if he come from this and and god didn't choose any of them look at what he did he bypassed even in jesus day pharisees sadducees kings herod pilate all of these great dignitaries he bypassed them all and was born in a little shepherd home amen instead of kings like that witness in his birth which kings would come from the east but instead of herod and and pilate and all the other different ones and caesar's recognizing here he's recognized by the angels of heaven now but what if we'd add another theologian with just another chart drawn or another book written by a smart educated man in services is this at the end is this a sign the answers he said if if it says they believe jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever but deny his signs and wonders that the whole realm of nature believed on him and all the church believed on him by this how will we know how to prepare somebody has come forth with the chart and drew it all out and somebody has come forth another thing and drew this all out contrary to this one did you ever go into a bible book store that's well stocked and see thousands of books and this one's got his ideas on that and this has got his ideas on that and this is contrary to that and you got book up on book and shelf upon shelf of books to go through and then you have the charts of the end time charts of of how things are to be and this is our idea of how the seals are to be laid out in this idea idea of all of this we got it all done and this is contrary the other wrote books and then he writes another and it's contrary to that one but god comes in the power of his resurrection and who's going to speak against it amen and jesus christ is the same yesterday today on forever he does the same thing that he did yesterday today and forever and that's what the angels to do is to take them mysteries and turn them loose sins that then people run out on so again you see it was it's not another chart it's not another book to add to the libraries it's not another good man in his thinking it is sent and signified by his angel amen now again in the breach brother branham talks about this he said you talk about a jubilee you talk about a time when the lamb walked forth see the book's even sealed in heaven the mysteries are is my name there i don't know i hope it is but if it is it was put on the book before the foundational world but the first thing that's represented that redemption come along that had been slain from the foundational world and he took the book glory and he opened the book and he tore off the seals and he sent it down to the earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to the people there you are oh my what happens the screams the shouts the hallelujahs the anointing the power the glory of the manifestation hallelujah do you realize what we're talking about am i not a theologian not a man's idea not another chart but the lamb [Music] trump the book and loose the shields and handed it down through the seventh angel on earth hallelujah and when they saw that happening in heaven amen what happened they began to scream and to shout and rejoice and if that's what they're doing in heaven what are we to be doing you're saying the lamb has opened the book the lamb has loosed the seal it ought to cause somebody to rejoice amen to worship god in the days gone by the voice of god thundered from mount sinai as the word was administered by an angel in daniel's day the man gabriel came from glory to reveal the divine plan in jesus day angels descended and announced in the heavens that this day in the city of david there is a child a baby born wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger amen in our day our day is no less phenomenal i know days of miracles have passed i know days of angels is over i know it's all finished and it's all closed up that's what they tell us but that ain't what god says come on church if the word has got to be restored it has to be vindicated by god it'll have to be signed and signified by an angel in our days seven angels come from glory revealing the seven sealed book of mysteries feast of the trumpet brother branham says it this way the angels of the lord appeared and told about the seven seals that i was to return back here to jeffersonville and preach the seven seals and there if i ever said anything that was inspired it was that there where the angel of the lord met us and the bible became a new book wasn't the angel wrote a new book amen but the revelation of it made the bible a new book amen not the same old thing that come out of denominations and their ideas come on somebody but the angel lord met us and the bible became a new book there it opened up and revealed all the things that the reformers and things had left out it was complete revelation of jesus christ altogether new to us but perfectly with the scripture that was the word which has always been and i was so inspired and directed as he approached the first seal he didn't know what to meant he had preconceived ideas that he had learned of other men oh he was only a seventh grade kentuckian but he had read some he had thought you know that sounds really good that sounds plausible and he preached sermons on amen he talked about you know about that white horse rider he preached as christ coming that's what they all were preaching that was the understanding till the angel came we all had a lot of understandings until the angel came he was a man just like anybody else with understanding as a man as daniel said i heard but i understood not he was in the same boat as daniel was till the angel came somebody with me amen and he said i was there i would well i would absolutely today and i hope the people are spiritual but i would have a horrible i would have made a horrible mistake on that if it hadn't been about 12 o'clock today when the holy spirit came in the room and corrected me on something i was writing down to say i was taking it from an old context i had nothing on it i don't know what the second seal is no more than nothing but i had some old context that i drew of something i just spoke on several years ago and wrote down and i gathered this context and dr smith and many great outstanding teachers i'd gathered and all of them believed that so i wrote it down that was the best people know they were probing at the book they were it was sealed with seven seals but they were trying to get a glimpse amen they were like they were like it was in daniel's day come on amen there was something was written but they didn't understand it i mean god had wrote it but they didn't understand it and then the chancellors and the great men and the teachers and and the wise men all come out and everybody guessed but they didn't understand it until a prophet came and when a prophet came what was written come on in mystery symbols now became known by the prophet to the people oh man now he can say exactly what these symbols were that was written by the finger of god god had wrote it with his finger but they didn't know what it meant till the prophet came because god was sending it and signifying it by his angel so then he would say here's what these strange symbols mean thou art weighed in the balance and found wanting now we know what it said because the prophet came amen because it was revealed to him by the angel it didn't come from his knowledge he was no smarter than the rest of them come on and brother branham same way you know everybody's guessing and he says about 12 o'clock in the day the holy spirit swept right in the room and the whole thing just opened up to me there was this first seal being opened and i'm as positive as i'm standing here that this is the gospel truth that i'm going to tell you about i know just know it is because if the revelations conjure the word then it isn't revelation and you know there's some of the stuff can look so absolutely true and yet it isn't truth it looks like it is but it isn't amen but because the time is near because we're in the end time god makes sure the end time people understand what do you say the wise shall understand there's going to come an understanding by the angel now brother branham would foretell this event by recounting a vision showing angels coming from heaven it came so fast that there were like a blink of the eye that was so fast he couldn't even count him were there five no seven mighty angels in the vision he he would he would see himself somewhere um close to tucson there in the desert and he would reach me reaching down and picking up a cockapoo from the cuff of his pants at that time there would come an explosion that shook the earth causing the rocks to roll down the mountainside remember when the first seal is open i heard as it were the voice of a thunder amen so it thundered there when john wrote about it it thunders again when it starts opening up amen and he said the blast sounded like thunder overhead maybe a supersonic airplane breaking the sound barrier we were breaking the sound barrier we were breaking the barrier of tradition the barrier of man's ideas we were breaking into realms unknown that had been previously unknown before and my god was breaking a people into a supernatural age into a supernatural time to make a supernatural people for a supernatural rapture now looking to the west he would see come in a pyramid shaped constellation of angels that were growing larger and larger as though they were coming at him at speed beyond his comprehension angels powerful beings with wings swept back heads turned slightly clothed in white armor and and he said and and trust him rushing for him from the edge of eternity they come at him so fast that he didn't have the time to count them accurately they were at least five no more than seven before he could blink his eyes they surrounded him and lifted him into their midst this is something that you only read about in the bible this is not something denominations tell you their leaders had this is something only duplicated or replicated in the bible this is biblical way this is biblical doctrine this is biblical pattern if it comes the other way now men would accept it more easily but it's not god's way you see men want to take it because it came with the accolades of dr so-and-so and studied bishop so-and-so and study and everybody with their robes on and their tassels on and their caps and whatever and they're going to give you the the the graduate party but that's not the way god does it god sends it and signifies it by an angel in the seventh seal brother branham comes down he said he said you notice one angel was was very notable to me he said it was the seventh angel he's to my left in the constellation the form of a pyramid in other words there were there were seven angels you know as as they were going up and and he said this one angel the angels took me into the pyramid of themselves the mysteries of god only known to them and they with the messengers that come with the messengers that come to interpret that pyramid or the message and the secret of these seven seals that lays inside the pyramid now i know that sounds like jargon but if you if we were reading in context it wouldn't because junior jackson had had a dream and had a dream that brother branham had been coming up the side of a mountain it was shaped like a pyramid coming up to an apex and he said as he was coming up on it he was he was identifying and you know and reading and interpreting the mysterious symbols on the side of that mountain and brother branham had been doing that he had preached the church ages we know now who the messengers were we know now they were ages we now know what they that that those uh some of them of desolate or distinct or unknown unmentionable places now today in time they have no meaning of time laodicea you might find some remnants of it some of the others a few remnants of it some of you can't maybe find anywhere of those seven cities are you with me they have no significant earthly significance today they were representing the ages and we come here to the last age and we can see now as he he was coming up inside the mountain in this dream and he was explaining all these mysteries and he gets up and there's something given to him from heaven some kind of tool put in his hands from heaven now let me tell you again i have to come from heaven no man could give this to him and he said on the top was this the capstone and he said it had to be opened up and a tool was given to me and my hand from heaven and he said i took it and i ripped off the top of that mountain and i looked in there and he said light had never shown this before and then it was a white rock with nothing written on it so it was a revelation but we don't know what it means it's a mystery but it's never been revealed light had never shown on it well there were seven thunders in the bible somebody helped me preach now that light had never shone on it had never been revealed to the church amen but those angels he said took me into that pyramid or that message of the secret of the seven seals that lie within that pyramid so he said there in that dream that was showing there i came to the place where light had never shown it but i'm telling you that's not our day light has now shown on that what was once obscured what was once held back what's what's what silence once which was unknown has been made known it was set and signified by an angel [Applause] now so the silence is now broken i'm so glad we don't have more days of silence there are those you don't want to go on said brother tim we're in the seventh seal in silence no we're in the seventh seal where it's opened and when you open it you open up the silence it used to be quiet don't what don't write this john seal it up it used to be that it was for seven ages until you had need to know it you know why because god was letting you know where you are where you are here in time let me explain it this way you walk into a park you look up here up on the side and you see the mouth well it's just anybody's guess is as good as yours as to where you're at you see a map but where am i at on this map is that right hey man this is this way it was i i went with brother george sometimes years ago we went down to florida and we was we were looking you know going down to his his mom and dad's place missed the highway he asked me get the map brother tim when we come to stop in the middle like get the map then you know tell me where we are i said we can't this map won't tell me where we're at what you have to do is go in that store and ask them where am i when you get the answer to that question of where i am i'll find that place on the map then i can get us to florida we were lost we didn't know what age we were in we didn't know what age what time what day what hour we didn't know we got 2 000 more years ago we didn't know but what happened god sent a messenger and he put his finger on the map and he said you are this is where you're at you have now arrived at the last thing welcome to the last these little children because in the last days it ain't no mysteries anymore in the last range you'll know you're in the end time in the last age you know you're part of the coming year right in the fifth seal brother branham said i want to give thanks to him who's omnipresent and that today not knowing one thing about that fits seal it came in that same mysterious way this morning about an hour before daybreak when i was out in prayer he continued that just a little later and said dim revelations in the presence of that ball of fire hanging there in that room oh brother although i've seen it since a child every time it comes near me it alarms me it almost puts me in an unconscious condition you never get used to it you can't it's too sacred and the seventh seal as he's winding up the preaching of those seals he says now you notice the mysterious parts of this week that's what it is that's what it's been it's been not a human being a man it's been those angels of the lord again he said what it is it's been the holy spirit sending down these messengers and they've been revealing it to us and then notice how it's dovetailed with the word exactly and then he says again in the seventh seal to let you know this the truth he foretold it about two months or more before it was ever happened but that when i went west not knowing it come back here with the interpretation as he's given it now remember in the in the um vision he never told me one thing in uh in the vision when he took me up i was scared afraid i was going to die be killed in an explosion you see they could not do it the interpretation came just as i had need of it that was in the room i gave it out just as he give it now friends visions don't fail they're perfect they're just exactly truth now the vision plus the word plus history plus the church ages and all blended together so i could truly say to the best of my understanding and according to the word of god the vision and the revelation and interpretation thereof it is thus saith the lord what a blessed people you are that's heard from god not from man god in the unveiling of god he said and think of it the same pillar of fire they come there come upon those men that wrote the bible is the same pillar of fire today here today interpreted in the bible amen and i'll tell you we thank him for that same what a comfort what an identification i'm so glad to be identified in that i don't know what i do i i'd rather be identified in that than all the baptists methodists presbyterian lutheran all the rest of them identified in that word where that's your kind of glory and revelation rays hallelujah that's why we're not identified in baptist methodist presbyterian pentecostal any of them we're identified in the word amen where that's the kind of glory and revelation ladies where that same pillar of fire that came up on those men that wrote the bible is the same pillar fight here interpreting the bible you say well i think well wait a minute is your wisdom greater than the angel well i believe well what do you believe if they don't agree with this angel it ain't the word that's right well i don't think it matters brother tim but what did the angel say you see what's the problem is is there's too many people around that hadn't been touched by the angels you got to get away from your traditions you're hearing tradition you're hearing them you're hearing these voices it don't matter oh that that ain't the way the world does i mean come on that's archaic oh look at this you know you're stupid to believe like that i mean come on you know the educated and the smart and the intelligent the girls at work and all of this and everybody else and your peers and so they got all of this understanding and all this knowledge where did they get it from it's a tradition it's their ideas say brother them these are your ideas no they're not you say they're william branham's idea no they're not these came from an angel now you've got to get away from your traditions of i'm a methodist or presbyterian or oneness brother branham would say he said let the angel get a hold of you one time the angel of the lord that'll bring you the truth of the message let it get ahold of you one time and you'll humble down to the baptism in jesus name you'll humble down to right to all the rest of it yes you will you shall you'll forget all of these intellectuals and i'll tell you what if you ever get touched by the angel you will never be the same the bible will be a new book to you and what you believe will not be your own ideas it will have come from the angel amen because only the angel is right god is his own interpreter you know what god means this and i don't think god listen but what did god say about it amen the bible said he cannot deny himself second timothy 2 13 if we believe not yet he abideth faithful he cannot deny himself doesn't matter whether you believe it or not god's going to be faithful to his word you can disagree and fall away and do whatever he's going to have a rapture anyhow he'll have a people without spot or wrinkle without a blemish come on he'll have a people who are chains he'll have a people who are touched by the angel a people who know their god who does exploits this is why you know you can't have the holy ghost and do things contrary to the word you know you you can't you argue against holiness you argue against bible doctrine bible principles and you know and if you argue you know against assembling yourselves together you make all of these arguments and that's the very evidence you don't have him amen because because again if you ever get touched by the angel you will humble yourself down to its truth are you with me now am i now brother branham would he have to do the same thing he had to lay down his own ideas he had to lay down previous sermons he couldn't just say now i'm just going to stick with what i've always known he had to change and you have to change too about any argument anything that comes up against the word of god you gotta you gotta change to fit the word because you've got to determine the word is right maybe i don't understand it maybe i can't put it together maybe it even goes against science may it goes against knowledge of man maybe it comes against what men's ideas are about this what the learned scholars said and this and that but if god said it you can stick your soul on hey mouth now brother branham himself would talk about things that he thought sounded real good to him and he said he tells about a conversation that he had with a man he calls dr lee vale and he said he asked me one time what i thought the initial evidence of the holy ghost was and wasn't speaking in tongues and this has been many years ago and i said no i can't see that and he said neither do i though i've been taught that so what would you think would be an evidence and he said the most perfect evidence i can think of his love and we got talking about that and i thought that sounded pretty good so i just held to that if a man's got love but one day in a vision the lord in a vision straightened me out and he said that the evidence of the spirit was those who could receive the word neither love nor speaking in tongues but it's receiving the word and he says dr vale said well that's scriptural because john 14 when he the holy ghost is come upon you he will reveal those things to you that i've taught you and will show you things to come that's john 14 26 this is the evidence of the holy ghost according to jesus himself but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send it by name he will teach you all things and will bring to all things he remembers whatsoever i said unto you this is the evidence of the indwelling spirit of god amen amen what will he do he will teach you all things amen he'll be your guide he'll be your leader he'll tell you when you're wrong he'll correct you when you're wrong amen he will convince you of sin when the holy ghost comes he will not let you live in sin he will convince you of sins and that's wrong repent of it amen that's the evidence of the indwelling spirit and he'll bring all things do you remember whatever thing i've said unto you in other words when you face the temptation you'll bring the word right up front so it's receiving the word now some men have taken that and reduced the baptism of holy ghost to just a mere confession of the word i've received the message i embrace his truth i receive the holy ghost when i believe the message now that's not message doctrine is taught by the angel that's baptist doctrine baptist doctrine is will you receive the holy ghost when you believe no wonder people can lie still do people dirty amen pull dirty conniving calculating unfair business deals all the while claiming to be filled with the holy ghost because they've embraced the doctrines of the message because they would say well i received it i say it's true and yet you see they have never received the holy ghost since they believed they believed and they say the message is true but it's never changed their life no wonder then we have people claiming to have the holy ghost in the message who can look in pornography they claim they're receiving the word while they're receiving pornography also now well but we receive the holy ghost when we believe the message i wonder if you have received this word then let's go to acts 19 1. paul having passed through the upper coast came to ephesus finding certain disciples he said unto them have you received the holy ghost since you believed now so so again in verse 2 he says we have not so much as heard that there be any holy ghost and he asked him well how was he baptized and they had been baptized in the name of jesus christ the sacrificed lamb they wasn't identified with him at all they just believed like the medicines being there but they hadn't took it and paul commanded them to be baptized over again in the name of jesus christ right verse 6 and when paul laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came on them and they what they spake with tongues and prophesied so i wonder if you've received this word as brother branham said in the token and when he did this the token came upon them and they were identified by the works and signs of the holy ghost speaking in tongues through them and prophesying and magnifying god they were identified as with their sacrifice this is why he was like don't just come this far and say i believe the message you obey the messenger coming to christ that's the obedience god wants you to obey the messenger coming to christ amen well i believe every word said brother brandon that's good but that's just being able to read that take the message drink it in your heart that you must have the token the very light that was in christ be in you when i see that i will pass over you amen it's the evidence of the holy ghost is he who can believe the word you can receive it amen now if you believe the word like they did come on and receive it like they did you'll do with the supernatural happening in your life amen it may not be a tongue it may not be interpretation it may not be prophecy but it'll be the supernatural god moving in your life changing you transforming you are you with me amen it's the evidence of a holy ghost is he that can believe the word you can receive it then i want to ask you then can you receive this word question answer 64. now the baptism with the holy spirit is a definite experience that a person must receive amen so again did you get a different experience if you didn't need to go back and get your first works done over again hey man if the supernatural doesn't take place there's something still lacking amen now you don't shout to get it but you will shout because you have it [Music] come on somebody it isn't sensation but it is sensational as brother branham said in the god hiding himself in simplicity god unfolded himself not in sensation but you know sensations yet with it but you say but that was before the day before the seals was open okay and in the sixth seal he says hear it all it is it is it is an emotion though emotion accomplishing it amen now again it is the evidence of the holy ghost is he who can believe the word you can receive it then can you receive this word and the mighty god unveiled he said now it's right to bring him back exactly like he was in the beginning the same ministry the same jesus the same power the same holy ghost the same one that came down on the day of pentecost is the same holy ghost as manifested today from glory unto glory to glory and is back again it's in its in its original seed with the baptism of the holy ghost with the same signs same wonders same baptism same kind of people acting the same way with the same power the same sensation it's from glory unto glory and the next glory will be changed from this glory in the body like his own glorious body where we shall see him well but it's the evidence of the holy ghost is he who can believe the word you can receive it well then can you receive this word in time evangelism the scientific theory of the modern so-called religious groups has tried to prove that this blessed thing that we have called the holy spirit his only emotion see it just don't stand up according to their scientific theory i'd like to ask them this what makes them change i can hear it sometimes brother tim you know your youth camps and your youth services and my the young people they get free why every generation has to have their own revival you had yours why would you not them but theirs let them out their revival and get revived with it get the search out of your collar again and remember how it was to be filled with the holy ghost to be optionalized by the angel remember how it was for the power of god to move over your life and change you and move there come on give somebody else an opportunity to have that amen he said well i said the thing said these religious groups have tried to believe this blessed thing we have called the holy spirit his only emotion now they wouldn't accuse many churches of that today the holy ghost has just been able to re receive the read you know you come down you confess god sent a prophet or jesus as savior and you got the holy ghost and it's just a dried confession you just go back on there and live in your sins and do the best you can that's not the gospel amen the scientific theory of this modern-day so-called religious group should try to believe prove that this blessed thing we have called the holy spirit's only emotion see it won't stand up to their scientific theory well i'd like to ask them this what makes them change come on amen you know i look around here what made them change amen what took men who were drunkards or alcoholics or or dope or womanizers come on and all kinds of them what made them change amen what makes the drunkard stops drinking what makes the prostitute see cease our evil life what makes the cancer and diseases depart from the people and the deaf and the dumb and the blind and the dead to raise up so well i ain't never seen a deaf person here here we've had them happen right here in the church come on amen we've had it happen right overseas where women come around with a hearing aid in their hands and i don't need this anymore i can hear the shower running in my bathroom i can hear the children out there playing i don't need hearing aids anymore because i've been changed in the presence of the angel amen don't tell me amen i know black eyes have come open i know the death is heard i know cancers have been healed i mean you can call it just emotion it's more than emotion amen it's a power of god into salvation amen it has emotion with it certainly brother branham said certainly certainly i wonder do you believe that part of the word those who say well i just believe the message i just listen what do you believe them that it has emotion with it certainly certainly stop me amen are you ashamed of the emotion that goes on in your church by the deal no it happens certainly every time the angel comes every time the power of god comes down every time the holy ghost moves every time that the healing begins every time salvation happens every time the prodigal comes home amen we get emotional certainly certainly i hear a prophet say anything that is alive has emotion and anything that doesn't have emotion is dead excuse the expression but i think we ought to bury some of this of mostly religion because it's dead it has no emotion to it any religion that has not emotion should be buried because it is emotional certainly certainly oh man and if you've got the holy ghost you know that certainly amen it's the evidence of the holy ghost who can believe the word can you believe that word certainly get the promises unto you and to your children to them that are far off and as many as the lord our god shall call certainly hallelujah and they got drunk in the upper room certainly and they shouted and not spoken other languages certainly they may have been prophesied they may have spoken of their language certainly [Applause] that's why brother branham could say i've seen jumping spells and joy spells but there wasn't nobody hurt this is the last sermon the one last sermon is in 64. the mountains rung out the sun went down everything took place but there was nothing nobody heard i've seen meetings where the power of god was revealed to people and they were freed from the world and the things the world and the joy of the lord filled the congregation they stood and screamed and cried and shouted to the top of their voice for the glory of god i never did see any disorderly there was always writing order because they had recognized that their name had been written on the lounge book of life before the foundation of the world they recognize jesus is mine jesus is mine he's not going to bear it he's mad we're not dreary he's mad when i'm sick because my name is written he said don't rejoice because devils are subject to you but your name is written in heaven hallelujah hallelujah it's the evidence of the holy ghost it's he who can believe the word can you can receive it i'm talking to people who can receive it amen i still got a ways to go amen keep on with me amen he said there on the day of pentecost i want to know can you receive this word then there that day on pentecost that 2x4 preacher he stood up there named peter and he said you meant a judea you that dwell you men of jerusalem you that dwell in judea let this be known to you and hearken to my words these are not drunk but let me tell you what the scripture said it'll be this is the light this is the word being manifested hallelujah what you see happening here is the word being manifested because it's been set and signified by his angel amen amen same thing that happens today they do just like they did then they walk away they shake their heads let them alone the blind leads the blind they'll all fall in the ditch amen oh it takes christ eternal life to bring the word of god word of life to the vindication and made flesh oh my goodness takes the holy ghost to operate the word of god amen when jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature now look mark 16 is last commission all the world all the world it has never got there yet all the world preached the gospel to every creature he that believeth in all the world and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe they shall shake hands with the preacher no they'll be good church members no in my name they will cast out devils they will speak with new tongues they will take up serpents or they drink deadly things it won't harm them if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover how far every creature how much all the world truly comes again these signs shall he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and even greater than me shall he do for i go to my father hallelujah you go back in the bible moses was sent and signified by an angel amen every person born of the spirit must meet the angel come on not as a hand-me-down not as a second-hand doctrine but as an experience the purifier had what moses liked amen until that moses was a coward until that moses ran from the call up until that moses made excuses and remember one moment in the presence of the pillar of fire hallelujah he came out anointed with the mighty angel set and sanctified by the angel he walked up with a stop in his hand and said i'm gonna take why he had become anointed by the angel in the fire and until you're anointed by the angel in the fire you're just a dead stick in the water remember the moment the angel comes it'll transform your life it'll empower you as a believer it will give you overcoming power to rise up again against the things of the world somebody help me preach now amen it'll give you a power and option [Music] oh my moses could walk down there at that time a call of god oh he knew he was called to be a prophet since he was a child he had been told oh you you know you're not of the world little children you you belong to christ and you know give your heart to jesus in the sunday school you know joy is the flag flowing high from the castle of my heart that the king is in residence there make yourself a place there you're you're a temple for god to come and dwell you've been told that since a child moses amen you've been called to be the bride of christ you're told that you've told your name is on the book of life before the foundational world you've been told that moses hey man you understand all of that but in order to really come into his place he had to meet god face to face he had to talk with the angel in the burning bush and get anointed by that angel and get set and signified by the angel no man has a right to call himself thus or until he's talked with god face to face on the backside of the desert somewhere where he talked to god himself all the atheists in the world can't explain it away from him he was there he knew what happened [Music] amen amen i want you brother joe you graduated from college stand up brother aaron you graduated from college stand up brother david butts you graduated from college stand up here you you graduated from college stand up get that college empower you atheists tried to discourage you and tell you wasn't right and not to believe on this jesus but you was not at the mercy of him that just had an argument the man's atheist because he never met god but you met him and nobody can talk you out of that angelic visitation no devil no no no argument no persuasion could ever move you away why you met the angel yourself that's what made the difference amen you can have your seats now now no man has a right to call himself a christian till he's met the angel i'm not talking you saw a little bit of pillar fire i'm not talking you saw a six-foot man walk out of a fire i'm talking about you come in the presence of almighty god amen and all the atheists in the world can never explain it away from you why every christian has to have that experience amen because they be before they can say anything about being a christian do you know we've had those who are 40 years in the message trying to preach the message and have never met god can you imagine we have generations that are raising up that that have never come into his presence when that's what the angel was sent to do because they have been denied that by because they have taken comfort in i've just received the doctrine and they become just a methodist believer or baptist believer or just like any kind of nominal denominational belief but i'm going to tell you friends there's an awakening going on moses had been 80 years so i've been 40 years in the message by the dead hey hey moses had been 80 years he had long forgotten god's promise amen it looked like god had forgotten him but god never forgets his promise let me tell you when god sends a message the word will never return unto him void it's going to accomplish what he sent it to do if he said i'll have a bride and she'll be without spot or wrinkle if he said i have a supernatural pride a supernatural race he's gonna have everything he said he would have he never forgets he never forgets oh i know discouraging words come and people will say uh now brother brad has been gone as long as he was alive he was here 56 years and this year he'd be gone 56 years he'd been gone just as long as he was alive you know all things remain as it was from the beginning but god never forgets a promise his word never returns to him void his holy spirit hovers over that word to make it come to pass and he's going to find oh hallelujah that predestinated elect seed somewhere and then send an angel to them touch it with that angel amen sent him out with a sign i have met god i am no longer the same i have not to say i don't have a methodist bible no more i don't have a baptist bible no more i don't have a pentecostal bible no more i've got a bible a new book a man that has been revealed sent and signified by the angel moses could then say i met the angel i've had an encounter with him i've been sent and signified by this angel i'm going to tell you this we have met the angel that's what makes us and sets us apart from all the rest that's why there's a stir going on and people who travel for hundreds of miles to come to a meeting say i gotta have what you got amen i'm missing something in my life i've preached it a long time but i don't have what i need and i'm coming because i want to meet that angel i want to come into that prison i want to see me set back signified by the angel of this presence hallelujah oh wonderful amen brother bradham said this is good for my nephew 1965 he talked about his his nephew a catholic boy i believe his name was melvin and he come to brother branham he said i've been having dreams oh i've been having dreams i've been having dreams of coming to the church running the altar where you're preaching making confession i've been wrong let me tell you got to get them somehow you hear them down in islam and different other places in the foreign countries where that where that in the middle of the night the angel of god comes to them and causes an awakening amen it happens right here amen the angel of god come in stern hearts you never came on your own come on the bible said no man seeketh after god no not one god sought after you hallelujah and he didn't give up on you even though that you'd run from him for 80 years like moses did he didn't give up on you that word kept chasing kept chasing moses it was there when he was in the sheep it was there in the tents of the media it was there everywhere that he went the angel of god moving moving moving moving until the time and god's got an appointed time [Applause] your time's different from my time but we all have our time amen and dear god reached out oh hallelujah come down to a backslidden man by the name of moses who had been whipped out who said i can't do it who said i'll never be able to conquer who said i forgot it and god's forgot it and god has given up on his plan but god did never give up on his plan because he will his word will not return to empire amen he said i watch over my word i water it day and night amen i'm gonna make sure it happens in its time in its season melvin he said been having these dreams he said melvin no matter how how many hail marys you say how many blessings you get from man you've got to be born again and the spirit of god is the only thing that will substitute that will satisfy the human heart he said i know they got a substitute today of being born again just shake hands with the preacher and put your name on the book but friends that's a dogma it's not the truth if it were the actual apostle in the second chapter would have read like this when the day of pentecost was fully come the pastor walked out and shook hands with the preacher can you imagine us coming down to that kind of backslidden condition around the message where we just shake hands with somebody and say well if you believe the message you got it amen but said when the day of pentecost was fully come do you know where we're at amen this is the day of all the fully comes fully coming so that don't make sense well let me tell you it was 50 days of pentecost where that god married israel upon mount sinai 50 days after the passover amen come on then the passover comes 50 days after jesus died at calvary here comes the day of pentecost they'll have the feast of weeks seven of them amen seven weeks since uh since the passover but when the day of pentecost was fully come but now we're in another day before he comes because dave we're only typing this day come on amen the new testament speaks of a bride in this end time is that right i mean since the passover since calvary we have had a feast of weeks of seven church ages but we've run out of ages we're here at the end time and this is the time when the day of pentecost again has fully come hallelujah there came a sound from heaven hey man here it comes out oh my this time what's it doing revealing all the mysteries showing yourself where we're at in the book about revealing the plan of redemption seven mighty angels stepping out amen in a pyramid form and revealing himself to prophet catching himself up giving him revelation you know why that this is pentecost this is the jubilee that's why heaven began to rejoice when they see the lamb had moved in heaven to take the book that's why we're rejoicing in this church that's why we're gathered like we are because we know the book isn't closed anymore we cannot meet with baptist methodist and presbyterian who preached from nicole's book we preach from an open book where all the mysteries of god are revealed amen this is the day of pentecost amen this is a time where all of the other acts of the scripture have been pointing and for running and speaking of our day and our hour there's somebody with me now amen he said there when the day of pentecost was fully come the inauguration of the church there came a sound from heaven like a rusty mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting that's how the holy spirit came the first time that's how it comes every time since that time he's god and he changes not and that stumbles of people they say that was for another day but he said he's the same yesterday today and forever and every time the church ever received the holy ghost it always come like he did the first time under the same prescription acts 2 238 never has changed never will change like a doctor's prescription for a disease he'll write it out for a prescription for disease the doctor does and then they're taking some quack drugs and he puts too much antidope in it and it's so weak it won't kill won't do you any good if it's too much poison and it'll kill you it's got to be wrote just according to the doctor and the doctor's prescription on how received the holy ghost is given to us by simon peter dr simon peter on the day of pentecost i'll give you a prescription repent and be every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin amen forever and you shall receive the gifts of the holy ghost for the prescription is to them that is fall and even as many as our lord our god shall call that's the eternal prescription hallelujah i wonder if the holy ghost that we we receive will agree that this right brother brandon talked about it he said a church this is birth pains he said when a little baby is born if you don't start breathing you spank him a little he yells out he said maybe in unknown tongues i never understood what idioms said i remember when i was when they were born i wasn't allowed to be in the hospital room with my wife but i was standing right outside the door listening for that first squeal amen it was always unknown tongues i guess to himself anyway he said he's making a noise and i think if a baby is born just by still birth no sound no emotion that's a dead baby that's what's a matter with the church today the system we got too many stillborn children that's right they need a gospel spanking you see so to wake them up and to bring them to their self so that god can breathe the breath of life into them amen now he said that's crude theology but it's the truth this is where we're at church listen the early church was led by pillar of fire if the pillar of fire is what brought the gospel in then the pillar of fire has to be here to take us in the rapture come on now amen now the in the bible the angel of the lord would show himself as a cloud by day and a light by night wherever the pillar of fire moved israel made sure their tent stakes wasn't driven down so far they couldn't move with it this has been the problem down to the ages hey man the pillar of fire moving people build a camp that might the pillar of fire would move on come on everybody closer it's trying to get them to the homeland of the bible so what they would do they had driven their stakes down so far they couldn't pull them up and move on so they made an encampment called badness or methodist or presbyterian or pentecostal are you with me amen so the same thing you see when the thunder had a fire it was a pillar fire where they stopped where it stopped they stopped where it moved they moved the priests will watch for it i think there needs to be some preachers today watching for the move of the pillar of fire hey man wave it was three o'clock they moved even moved at 12 midnight they moved they packed up when they saw it moving they packed up and went with it and they followed that pillar of fire they kept the will of god by doing that now but what happened luther organized his church drove his tent states down so far and the pillar of fire wouldn't hang over that come on so way it went and so luther and his followers they couldn't follow it and so it just weakened right down into an encampment are you with me now pillow if fire moved away from the lutheran church amen luther couldn't go because he had all his rituals and everything else and a little fella by the name of john wesley saw it move amen it was a holiness move he was there he watched a revival that saved england saved the united states let me tell you the values that we have in america came from seeing the pillar of fire amen and the holy spirit moved are you with me amen but what happened they would have george whitefield and george whitefield different ones that would stand up and they would preach the gospel circuit writer preacher they had a great revival but they got organized amen until they got the you know until finally it just becomes as cold and starchy as it can be and the pillar of fire listening to god's prophet will not hold over starchy and coldness amen it will not stay overnight when the when the pillar of fire moves you got to move the old song says when the lord gets ready you got to move you got to move you got to move come on hey man the pillar of fire won't hold over that he said then the bunch of people called the pentecostals got it they've seen it and the way they went but the sad part of it they so organized until the pillar of fire is moving out again and they can't go hallelujah but he said tonight here at god's house what that same pillar of fire is here in the house right here because it was the angel of heaven the lord jesus christ when he died he rose again he lives forever more he promised things he would do we would do also and greater and he went to the father is that right amen so again the pillar of fire is now in the house the next place is going to be the rapture [Music] hallelujah and i want to send notice i can see the pillar of fire moving again it's gathered the elect it's called the calling in the protocol it's healing the sick it's casting out devils come on now i see that cast out devils i know it cast out devils amen i've had a bow to me ten seven times and falling claps in the floor and the person never go back out in the sin again i know the power of this word i've seen it at youth camp when a demon there would confront me as i laid my hands on and anointed with oil and began to slap at me and snarl and snap and slap and whatever and could not do could not make contact with my body because there was somebody greater that was present than little tim pruitt a man who was trying to hold a bottle of oil like this and keep it from spilling while i'm trying to lay hands on somebody and they're a demon growling and speaking in a beast-like condition but i saw the power of jesus christ bring that thing down to its knees and valley deliver that world and set her free to serve the living god amen i see that happen when peace was spoken i know the power of this gospel i know it healed the sick i know what it means for the angel to visit my home and then the passover a woman there with a brain bleed and her psyche back don't tell me god don't heal sight her sight came back don't tell me god don't heal blindness her blindness was done away with don't tell me god don't heal a crippled child and bring visions to pass god did it it happened he said and he signified it by his angel and that angel is in the camp this morning because he's the same yesterday today and forever lead the people into their promised land hallelujah do you believe that i believe it let's stand together worship god hallelujah hallelujah you don't
