[41:43] let's turn to numbers chapter 33 and
[41:47] we'll read from the third verse for our
[41:50] scripture reading this morning
[41:52] appreciate each one of you that has come
[41:54] out to be in the service of the Lord
[41:56] today numbers 33 verse 3 and they
[41:59] departed from ramiz's in the first month
[42:04] on the fifteenth day of the first month
[42:06] on the morrow after the Passover the
[42:10] children of Israel went out with a high
[42:13] hand in the sight of all the Egyptians
[42:16] for the Egyptians buried all their
[42:19] firstborn which the Lord had smitten
[42:22] among them upon their gods also the Lord
[42:26] executed his judgement man god bless you
[42:30] can be seated we're going to be speaking
[42:33] this morning on the night of the Exodus
[42:36] as we just look further into the Word of
[42:40] God and there's some things here that I
[42:43] want to bring out in the service today
[42:45] that has to do with this evening time
[42:48] that we're in and it's certainly a great
[42:53] hour that we're living in yet it's also
[42:55] a time of darkness yet at the same time
[42:58] as Paradoxal it's a time of a great
[43:01] light because the scripture said in the
[43:03] evening time after day of darkness and
[43:07] dismal time it shall be light now Israel
[43:10] had received a prophet vindicated with
[43:13] the pillar of fire with signs
[43:16] proof that he had a message from God
[43:19] you can't imagine God sending Moses down
[43:22] there and that haven't not yet met with
[43:25] him no pillar of fire no vindication no
[43:29] sign no nothing that he was truly son of
[43:32] God ah you know this would have never
[43:35] worked because they had to be sure that
[43:39] this was God because this would bring on
[43:41] some times of great persecution even and
[43:45] great trouble and tribulations because
[43:48] of the message that of deliverance that
[43:51] they had received and so it would take
[43:53] the vindication of God first of all to
[43:57] show that Moses was truly sent from God
[44:00] now as the Exodus were approached they
[44:03] were told as we have been going through
[44:06] it to take a lamb without blemish and
[44:09] applies blood upon the doorpost and upon
[44:12] the lentil and I think it's a wonderful
[44:15] parallel because we too have received
[44:17] the message that the Holy Ghost must be
[44:21] applied even as Israel applied that the
[44:24] blood the token sign of the Holy Ghost
[44:27] the literal life of Jesus Christ must be
[44:31] on display and I don't think these
[44:34] things can be overemphasized because as
[44:37] brother Branham would say you're the
[44:39] token message is the highlight of my
[44:41] ministry my entire ministry so I think
[44:45] if it's a highlight you know that's the
[44:47] focus this is what God wanted to
[44:49] highlight in this day that there would
[44:52] be a people that would have his own life
[44:54] and to have his own life would have his
[44:57] own attributes his own his own signs his
[45:01] own power now so the token sign of the
[45:06] Holy Ghost the literal life of Christ
[45:08] must be on display and that we as
[45:12] believers are in Passover as we went
[45:16] through last week the Passover is not
[45:19] just a feast that um that we would
[45:22] partake of but it would be it would be
[45:25] something that we are in
[45:27] continually they're eating the lamb
[45:31] taking of the unleavened bread preparing
[45:35] for the journey until the summons to
[45:38] come out now
[45:41] I want to review again first Corinthians
[45:44] five and seven because this scripture
[45:47] has been popping out to us as we have
[45:50] gone along remember this is a scripture
[45:52] that would open up to brother Branham
[45:55] there after seeing the vision of the
[45:57] binding of the of the the the deadly
[46:01] snake if he said if you bind this one
[46:03] you bind everything underneath him and
[46:05] so this is of something very key to us
[46:09] being able to bind the Death Angel in
[46:12] this day and that is that we are in a
[46:15] continual communion or Passover with the
[46:19] Lord that it's not a as was often
[46:23] thought if I just get the Holy Ghost you
[46:25] know but just get that initial
[46:27] experience i if I just if I just you
[46:31] know feel the presence of God if it just
[46:33] comes down on my flashing if it just
[46:36] sebade over my spirit you know I error
[46:39] everything's okay I can be I can be done
[46:41] with it I can come just sit back and
[46:44] rest on my laurels and and you know sit
[46:47] back at my pew and just pretend you know
[46:50] that everything is is okay but it's not
[46:54] that way at all because it brings you
[46:57] into a time of Passover into a
[47:01] fellowship with God and it is a
[47:03] continual fellowship it's not something
[47:07] that that just is one initial experience
[47:10] and I want to encourage every person in
[47:13] here who's have an experience with God
[47:15] to seek for another one to seek for a
[47:19] fresh and up-to-date experience with God
[47:22] that it's not just just something you
[47:25] got at the altar twenty forty years ago
[47:28] but it's a renewing of the Holy Ghost
[47:31] and a constant refreshing in his
[47:34] presence and I think this is very
[47:36] important
[47:37] and that we understand that that we
[47:39] cannot none of us can allow our
[47:43] ourselves to get in a place of doldrums
[47:45] at lukewarmness and the end where we're
[47:48] dilatory and slothful and lazy and
[47:51] Laodicea like but we must be a people
[47:54] where you said if any man will open the
[47:57] door I will come in and I was sucked
[48:00] with him and he with me that there will
[48:02] be the Lord's Passover this is a
[48:05] fellowship meal with the Lord that you
[48:07] enter into a relationship with God so
[48:12] it's not just an experience but it's a
[48:15] relationship that you enter into so he
[48:18] said purge out therefore the old leaven
[48:20] that you may be a new lump as you are
[48:24] eleven for even Christ our Passover is
[48:28] sacrificed for us therefore let us keep
[48:32] the feasts notice keep the feast it that
[48:36] Paul is not saying this is a day this is
[48:39] one once a week this is something that
[48:42] we do once a month this is something
[48:45] that we do once a year as Israel would
[48:48] do but let us keep the feast it is a
[48:51] continual feast all right not with the
[48:55] old leaven neither with the leaven of
[48:58] malice and wickedness but with the
[49:00] unleavened bread of sincerity and truth
[49:04] this hour recalled in for transparency
[49:09] it is calling for dedication and
[49:12] sincerity notice on this night in in
[49:16] Egypt I just imagined among the the
[49:22] encampment of the Jews down in Goshen
[49:25] there is not anyone out on the streets
[49:28] there is has been no curfews that's been
[49:32] imposed by the Egyptians but there's no
[49:34] parties going on there's no drinking
[49:37] there's no carousing there's no going in
[49:41] and out is not running to the neighbor's
[49:43] house and back and forth but all the
[49:46] Israelites have applied
[49:49] the blood and have closed the door they
[49:52] have entered into a time where there's
[49:56] no go in the in and out no up and down
[49:59] no no you know in the is someone but
[50:03] their foot it's still out in the world
[50:05] and their heart out in the world and
[50:08] maybe part of them in a Passover but no
[50:11] everybody shut inside a man the Passover
[50:16] lamb has been accepted and is in there
[50:19] being eaten leaven which is a type of
[50:22] sin has been removed now let me explain
[50:26] this to our young people you wonder what
[50:28] Lebanese lemon is it's like a sourdough
[50:31] is a yeast that is put in in their in
[50:35] the meal in the in the flour and you put
[50:39] it in there and it starts expanding and
[50:42] growing and growing and it puffs up the
[50:44] bread and makes it you know pleasurable
[50:47] and light what we call light bread and
[50:51] you know it can be if it makes something
[50:54] instead of being a flat bread which is
[50:57] seemingly real plain it becomes a real
[51:00] puffed up and easy to eat and and it's a
[51:04] type of sealing that's what it is it's a
[51:07] type of sin and it don't take much
[51:09] leaven or much sin to leaven the whole
[51:13] lump because what happens is is that it
[51:17] begins to grow you let sin come in in
[51:20] one form it just continues to grow and
[51:23] expand and gets bigger and a bigger now
[51:26] it's kind of like brother branham a
[51:28] described um the the maniac there at
[51:33] Gadara
[51:33] and he said he he done one little sin
[51:36] maybe he told a lie and then that in the
[51:38] led to another
[51:39] that would led to another until he was
[51:42] now had legions of demons he get invited
[51:46] him one at a time to come in until he is
[51:49] now totally possessed so you see a
[51:53] little bit of leaven starting out with
[51:55] just a little devil may open the way for
[51:57] another devil and it opened up another
[52:00] devil until he became he became not even
[52:04] known by who he was a meant but but
[52:07] known by the devil's that had possessed
[52:09] him his name became a legion right hey
[52:14] man
[52:14] but anyway again you know there there
[52:17] was no eleven that the word is nothing
[52:21] added to it
[52:22] there's no Creed's to puff it up no
[52:25] man's wisdom added to it no schools of
[52:28] theology putting their own ideas into it
[52:31] and and making it a easier gospel to
[52:35] swallow but just the plain simple gospel
[52:39] of Jesus Christ in its saving power and
[52:43] its life-giving measures are you with me
[52:46] hey man so again you know no leaven the
[52:50] type of sin is removed the stop is in
[52:53] the hand the shoes are on the feet
[52:56] you're ready to lead preparations being
[52:58] made now brother branham said this and
[53:02] who do you say this is we're in a
[53:04] critical hour how many would agree with
[53:06] that the world is but the church the
[53:10] real church not the denomination but the
[53:13] church itself is ready for the greatest
[53:17] triumph it ever made
[53:19] the coming of the groom to the bride so
[53:23] here we are you know in a critical hour
[53:26] but what an hour we are from are in for
[53:29] the church it's the greatest triumph it
[53:33] ever made my every age has been waiting
[53:36] for this time as Israel would have been
[53:39] talking about no doubt when they when
[53:42] they arrived there in Egypt again and
[53:44] then that taskmasters came and the
[53:46] people begin to long oh that we had a to
[53:49] go back to our homeland
[53:50] oh that we can return back you know that
[53:53] we could go you know here again we're at
[53:56] a point where we're looking at this
[53:58] world and we're beginning to say Lord we
[54:01] want out of here we're getting what we
[54:03] want to leave this place we believe
[54:06] there's a homeland that we heard about
[54:08] that Abraham saw a city whose bill
[54:12] maker is God and whirring dwelleth
[54:15] righteousness and we want to go to that
[54:17] land we're tired of the sickness and the
[54:20] sorrow and the death and perpetuating
[54:24] the ages and man we want to see it all
[54:26] finished up and there's a longing in our
[54:29] hearts that to hear that we are in an
[54:33] exodus Mallen now this time a Passover
[54:38] is where we're at and you must have the
[54:41] presence of the Lord in your dwelling
[54:43] that's a church in your home and in your
[54:47] body we are in Passover and we're not to
[54:50] leave it until we're called out of this
[54:52] dimension into that great exodus when
[54:55] the trumpet of sounds but I want you to
[54:58] know it's a very dark night and we can
[55:02] hear the sounds and the screams coming
[55:05] from every level of society and it's
[55:09] trying to come in and permeate it's like
[55:12] like a you know what's a demon has been
[55:15] cast out of a person even sickness you
[55:18] know he still wants to come back knock
[55:21] on the door with fear or weed out or
[55:25] some kind of a fresh - frustration you
[55:28] know what I'm talking about and then man
[55:30] he comes back and announced but you got
[55:32] to keep the good man of faith they're
[55:35] holding the door shut and men standing
[55:38] behind the token and saying no I was
[55:41] delivered of that and I'm not taking
[55:43] that thing back hey man I'll never
[55:46] receive that thing again I know what it
[55:48] means to be free and I'm not going back
[55:52] to his slavery and it's bondage again
[55:55] how many feels that way this morning I'm
[55:58] I now of course in this hour of darkness
[56:01] it was a great hour of darkness that
[56:04] Moses when he came to Israel it was in
[56:07] their darkest hours and there was a
[56:10] Jennison Jamboree the Bible said that we
[56:14] stood Moses and I want you to realize
[56:17] why they withstood Moses they came to
[56:21] try to produce
[56:24] to make years look like it meant nothing
[56:29] they come along with with signs
[56:32] themselves to try to devalue the voice
[56:36] of God they came along and Dennis and
[56:40] Jambres were there impersonation
[56:42] remember they're the ones that would
[56:44] threw down their rod and it would become
[56:46] a serpent - hey man and they were they
[56:50] were there would be ones who would
[56:51] imitate or impersonate what Moses was
[56:56] doing to try to detract from the message
[57:00] that God had sent and calls a hardness
[57:04] of heart among the Egyptians amen but it
[57:08] not only caused the hardness of heart
[57:10] among the Egyptians it even caused the
[57:12] Israel to doubt it even caused them to
[57:16] fear it even calls them to wonder and I
[57:21] just want you to understand that we're
[57:23] in a time where where where there's a
[57:26] lot of things that are going on because
[57:29] the message of God has been whispered by
[57:34] every kind of thing you can imagine a
[57:37] man and the enemy has come in in every
[57:40] way he comes in through every time a
[57:42] voice to try to discredit the messenger
[57:46] and his message a man it causes and as
[57:51] we're right here on the birds of the
[57:53] Exodus and and Peter would tell us Peter
[57:56] would tell us it right here at the
[57:58] exodus golfers would arise hey man
[58:02] and these golfers would arise saying
[58:04] where is the sign of his coming you see
[58:07] causing people to doubt the sign and
[58:11] then to doubt the voice and the doubt
[58:14] the message but I'll tell you there is
[58:17] no greater message than a message that
[58:20] will bring you in the fellowship with
[58:22] Christ in the Passover and put silicide
[58:26] a man bring you in love with Jesus
[58:29] Christ and with his word there's no
[58:32] greater message than that
[58:34] hey man now I want you to as we look at
[58:37] this because remember they had their
[58:40] impersonations and they were able to
[58:43] convince many not to get under the blood
[58:48] think about it
[58:51] Jamison jammers were able to convince
[58:54] many not to really get under the blood
[59:00] this is a time of darkness when
[59:04] impersonators will abound what an hour
[59:09] to be living in I just want to go over
[59:12] just a little history as we relate to
[59:15] this age and this night that we're in
[59:20] we'll talk about that in a minute
[59:22] because some will disagree with me that
[59:25] this is night but I just want to make
[59:27] you understand mourning doesn't come
[59:30] till the Sun rises and until Jesus comes
[59:34] mourning ain't here yet so we're in the
[59:39] time of darkness it's a time of great
[59:42] darkness upon the earth now we're not of
[59:44] that darkness and we do have light come
[59:50] on
[59:50] amen Israel is there with light in their
[59:53] dwellings and they're eating the
[59:55] Passover but outside on the other side
[59:59] the blood is all darkness everywhere is
[1:00:03] that right it's a dark night and there's
[1:00:05] every kind of hoodlums and every kind of
[1:00:08] eerie spirits and every kind of creepy
[1:00:11] thing and let me tell you it's only
[1:00:13] worse in this day because the Bible
[1:00:16] speaks of coming out of the river
[1:00:18] Euphrates in Revelation 9 that are
[1:00:21] released given permission supernatural
[1:00:25] demons you can read it in the Bible 300
[1:00:28] million of them more coming in this age
[1:00:31] the what there's ever been so all the
[1:00:35] sin and doctors heaped up plus things
[1:00:39] that have been bound loosed God
[1:00:42] permitted them to come to bring about
[1:00:44] this end time
[1:00:47] to bring about this evil age that
[1:00:50] wetland and Satan now has a Satan's Eden
[1:00:54] now every kind of thing is right at your
[1:00:57] fingertip for every sin every kind of
[1:01:00] darkness every kind of evil is right
[1:01:03] there it permeates your mind you're
[1:01:06] thinking your attitudes and you are
[1:01:10] having to wrestle you are having to
[1:01:12] wrestle with things that are being said
[1:01:14] in the world today that science is
[1:01:18] saying that education is saying that
[1:01:20] society is saying every time of darkness
[1:01:26] trying to get in your doors come on you
[1:01:30] got to have the blood applied hey man if
[1:01:33] you don't have that blood applied let me
[1:01:35] tell you you young people going to
[1:01:36] college you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:01:38] it'll sweep you right away you'll get in
[1:01:41] these liberal arts and they'll change
[1:01:43] your thinking change your attitude and
[1:01:46] Mark you Mark you into a demon yourself
[1:01:50] it'll happen without the Holy Ghost
[1:01:53] you'll become a legion now not only that
[1:01:59] in school wherever you are it's part of
[1:02:02] the society that we're living in now
[1:02:06] it's the time of Darkness impersonations
[1:02:09] abound but I want to go back to this
[1:02:11] walk in our to be delivering it to be to
[1:02:16] be living in a time of deliverance the
[1:02:20] angel of the Lord we have had in this
[1:02:23] generation have visited a little
[1:02:27] Kentucky preacher and held heralded one
[1:02:30] of the greatest divine healing moves
[1:02:32] ever to forerun the second coming of
[1:02:37] Christ to prepare a people for an exodus
[1:02:42] hey mom
[1:02:44] now this would happen and God would
[1:02:48] saying and sound out of heaven as john
[1:02:52] the baptist was sent to forerun the
[1:02:53] first coming of christ you're sent with
[1:02:56] a message to forerun the second of
[1:02:58] second coming of Christ
[1:03:00] this would be resounded there among the
[1:03:03] the Pentecostals and the meetings there
[1:03:05] in 1946 1947 on and on and on Pitts
[1:03:10] there these prophecies would break out
[1:03:13] and announce that this man was coming
[1:03:17] with a message that would four-run the
[1:03:20] second coming of Christ that would
[1:03:23] prepare a people for an exodus now 1955
[1:03:30] and I'm going back on a little bit of
[1:03:32] history but I I want you to understand
[1:03:34] this because I've pondered a lot I've
[1:03:37] pondered a lot about what happened in
[1:03:39] the divine healing movement and wide
[1:03:42] that it died why that it just went out
[1:03:46] to nothing and Men went right back out
[1:03:48] into organizations worse than what they
[1:03:51] were most time it didn't help a bit it
[1:03:54] made him worse than what they were they
[1:03:57] want to talk about William Branham
[1:03:59] getting off it in let you know because
[1:04:01] of him bringing the word to us let me
[1:04:04] tell you about all Robertson him getting
[1:04:06] out on the end
[1:04:08] maa ala then with him getting off at the
[1:04:11] end I'm an attack Co and him getting off
[1:04:14] at his end I'm there and oil Jagger's
[1:04:18] and him getting off in his office and
[1:04:20] they they don't talk about that I
[1:04:23] remember because that brother branham
[1:04:26] wouldn't go with the fluid denomination
[1:04:28] he got off wonder what happened they a
[1:04:31] Alan who died a drunk or are all Roberts
[1:04:35] who God was threatening with his life
[1:04:37] you know to build a with to raise
[1:04:39] millions of dollars for him before he
[1:04:42] left and make it pleas for money and
[1:04:44] died in disgrace impersonators that
[1:04:50] Follies have been made known none of
[1:04:55] them had a message every one of none of
[1:04:58] them have a message I'm an only there of
[1:05:02] the one the man who the angel came to
[1:05:05] wound up with a message and that message
[1:05:08] is going to turn somebody's heart
[1:05:11] I believe is turning our hearts back to
[1:05:13] the faith again are you with me
[1:05:16] now in 1955 brother Branham was taken
[1:05:20] consideration of his ministry divined
[1:05:24] the healing campaigns by this time in
[1:05:27] less than a decade had turned into who
[1:05:30] has the biggest hint or who has the most
[1:05:32] subscribers to their magazine or you see
[1:05:35] it become all about preachers eagle and
[1:05:39] kingdom building yet the man who had the
[1:05:42] angel come to to him and was the most
[1:05:46] gifted William Branham had no magazine
[1:05:49] he had no tent and he had no he had no
[1:05:53] tip he had no magazine and he had no
[1:05:56] organization I want you to think about
[1:06:02] this now because this man was set apart
[1:06:07] from all the others every one of them
[1:06:09] even Jack Cole when he'd talk about it
[1:06:11] in the meat he said now tomorrow night
[1:06:13] brother Brandon will be here he was
[1:06:15] revered and honored among all of them as
[1:06:18] being the man who were inspired the
[1:06:21] whole movement brother Branham talked to
[1:06:27] Bobby he said I had a magazine he said
[1:06:30] you know when I started out I you know
[1:06:32] that they'd come to me and said be good
[1:06:34] to take some of the money races in the
[1:06:36] campaigns and start a little magazine to
[1:06:39] publish what God is doing and let people
[1:06:41] know and he said one day while I was
[1:06:43] praying God gave me the name voice of
[1:06:46] healing and he said in a rank right with
[1:06:49] my ministry the voice of one crying in
[1:06:51] the wilderness and so forth and I gave
[1:06:53] it the name voice of healing so he said
[1:06:57] God gave me the name for that voice of
[1:06:59] healing it coordinates with my ministry
[1:07:01] as the voice of one John the Baptist who
[1:07:05] was pride in the wilderness outside
[1:07:07] ended on the denominational ranks and
[1:07:10] saying come out of her a man come to the
[1:07:14] Lord yet William Branham would actually
[1:07:17] he had signed his paper over to Gordon
[1:07:21] Lindsay and even gave his organization
[1:07:23] the
[1:07:24] it's a healing away he signed it over to
[1:07:27] Gordon Lindsey along with his tent and
[1:07:30] and he would actually actually have to
[1:07:32] rent his own tent from the voice of
[1:07:36] healing this is actually true this is
[1:07:40] history brother Branham said himself and
[1:07:44] I'm just quoting him he said I started
[1:07:46] in I organized a little paper called the
[1:07:48] voice of healing and and they still have
[1:07:52] it here well I found out in it that then
[1:07:54] there was a lots of finances and things
[1:07:57] hooked up to it and I'll wash my hands
[1:07:59] of that stuff a long time ago
[1:08:01] so the voice in healing is not my paper
[1:08:03] I have nothing to do with it not at all
[1:08:06] that belongs to brother Lindsey and at
[1:08:09] Shreveport Louisiana and come to find
[1:08:12] out I got into that and I thought I was
[1:08:14] getting out of organizations and I got
[1:08:16] into one and it was just almost just
[1:08:19] organized down to every one of them in
[1:08:22] there and I belong to and hey but he
[1:08:24] said I belong to just the Lord Jesus and
[1:08:27] then I can come and go where I wish to
[1:08:29] and where he leads to me I can be free
[1:08:32] so this man William Branham was so
[1:08:35] humble and so sincere too sincere and
[1:08:39] too dedicated to God to manage a big
[1:08:44] organization they thought and the
[1:08:48] historians look back on his life and and
[1:08:50] they talk about him being too ill
[1:08:53] illiterate or too naive or perhaps they
[1:08:57] even insinuate he was too stupid to
[1:09:00] build a huge Kingdom for yourself and
[1:09:03] you you know if you just look at it in a
[1:09:05] way here's a man more gifted than all of
[1:09:09] them can build the biggest Kingdom the
[1:09:11] greatest have the greatest name out
[1:09:13] there had the biggest following had the
[1:09:16] most money and he refused to build it up
[1:09:22] because he wants to be true to God in
[1:09:25] his message and he don't want to build
[1:09:29] another Kingdom and he's not looking for
[1:09:32] a following and he's not worried about a
[1:09:36] news
[1:09:36] and ambien having the most subscribers
[1:09:39] and the most famous because he knows
[1:09:43] what a get a preacher is money women and
[1:09:45] popularity and so he shuns at all the
[1:09:51] man gave up his own paper to voice of
[1:09:53] healing that God gave him the name of
[1:09:55] gave his tanner to Gordon and the voice
[1:09:58] of heal and then paid rent on his own
[1:10:00] town I'm telling you the truth
[1:10:02] 1955 he would actually abruptly quit and
[1:10:06] go home because there was not enough
[1:10:08] money to cover the campaigns he was out
[1:10:11] in California and was fifteen thousand
[1:10:13] dollars in debt that's equivalent to a
[1:10:16] hundred and thirty thousand dollars in
[1:10:19] today's money now wikipedia reports that
[1:10:24] during this subsequent investigations it
[1:10:27] was found that his manager Gordon
[1:10:29] Lindsey was accident skimming off most
[1:10:32] of the money for his own use you know
[1:10:33] brother branham didn't want it so I'll
[1:10:35] put it to use so it was reported that
[1:10:39] brother Branham had a salary of seven
[1:10:41] thousand dollars while Lindsay made
[1:10:43] eighty thousand to manage the campaign
[1:10:46] today's money brother Brandon would make
[1:10:49] a salary of sixty-two thousand a year
[1:10:51] while Lindsay pocketed seven hundred and
[1:10:53] fifty thousand a year and when all of
[1:10:57] this went to build the Christ for the
[1:10:59] nations in Dallas Texas in its Bible
[1:11:01] School
[1:11:02] because then Lindsay would change the
[1:11:04] name of it from voice of healing to
[1:11:06] Christ for the nations now it wasn't at
[1:11:10] all that God had failed to provide it
[1:11:13] was that men with their own greed and
[1:11:16] agendas were misusing the funds and by
[1:11:19] now the field was so crowded with
[1:11:22] impersonators each one of them touting
[1:11:24] who had the biggest tent and the biggest
[1:11:27] magazine with the most subscribers to be
[1:11:29] you know the and the and the man with
[1:11:34] the greatest gift
[1:11:36] who was visited by the message or by the
[1:11:39] angel with the real message was pushed
[1:11:43] aside by the masses and the masses
[1:11:47] followed the impersonators rather than
[1:11:51] the real one that went out first and the
[1:11:55] rescue only copied I'm getting somewhere
[1:11:59] I'm gonna try to bring something down to
[1:12:01] you about this
[1:12:02] these impersonators are rows you know
[1:12:05] Oral Roberts had come to Brother
[1:12:07] Brennaman in brother branham's Tim
[1:12:10] brother Brandon would tell about it
[1:12:12] the Ministry of Oral Roberts first time
[1:12:14] I remember the first time I met all
[1:12:16] Roberts a little ragged Tim sitting on
[1:12:19] the other side I was in I was in Kansas
[1:12:22] City Kansas and he was in Kansas City
[1:12:25] Missouri we met around behind the stage
[1:12:27] and he shook hands with me said brother
[1:12:30] branham do you think God would answer my
[1:12:31] prayers for the sick and I said he'll
[1:12:33] answer anybody's prayer for this thing
[1:12:35] we got her pictures together it's an old
[1:12:37] copy of the voice of healing if many of
[1:12:40] you have it and that's how oral got
[1:12:43] started out look how his ministry growed
[1:12:45] and now into millions and millions and
[1:12:47] millions of dollars now building a big
[1:12:50] school of theology an oral would go out
[1:12:54] and impersonate as you know God gave
[1:12:58] brother Branham a sign in his left hand
[1:13:00] well oral comes out claiming the power
[1:13:03] of God in his right hand and turn it you
[1:13:06] know and of course at the power of God's
[1:13:08] in anybody's hand it takes away from the
[1:13:10] virtue of Christ the power of God is not
[1:13:13] in a man the power of God is he is in
[1:13:16] the world a man now so again you know
[1:13:21] then then of course oral would turn off
[1:13:24] to a prosperity gospel promoting the
[1:13:26] plan and must see the faith in his
[1:13:28] ministry sending him money God will
[1:13:30] bless you financially and return it he
[1:13:33] would join himself to the Methodists and
[1:13:35] deny his Pentecostal roots and finally
[1:13:38] finally he would end his ministry with a
[1:13:41] with a false vision of a 900 foot tall
[1:13:44] Jesus telling him to build a great
[1:13:48] building in Denver and then later God
[1:13:50] would would tell him supposedly tell him
[1:13:53] that if you didn't raise three million
[1:13:55] dollars that he he
[1:13:58] life would be taken and and so you know
[1:14:01] he began to you know move on his
[1:14:04] subscribers to to put ascended money to
[1:14:07] keep him from dying in the magnons in
[1:14:10] disgrace Jaco we've talked about him his
[1:14:16] meeting a brother branham bruh he would
[1:14:19] have to admit William Brandon was sent
[1:14:21] here for dispensational purposes Jack go
[1:14:25] with his big ego starting out a little
[1:14:28] humble man but then his ego grew and his
[1:14:32] quest to be the best he would go and
[1:14:35] measure all roberts10 and built one one
[1:14:38] foot bigger so he could boast of having
[1:14:42] the biggest tent in the biggest magazine
[1:14:45] with the most subscribers and in 1956 he
[1:14:49] would die he would get sick over here
[1:14:54] and in Hot Springs Arkansas and go back
[1:14:56] to Texas and died just a young man 38
[1:15:00] years old and died of about of a
[1:15:04] Harville disease and in his ministry
[1:15:07] would in and and just go into shatters
[1:15:12] started out a little Pentecostal
[1:15:14] preacher Assembly of God another another
[1:15:18] minister hey Alan an assembly God began
[1:15:22] with his tenth began being arrested for
[1:15:25] drunkenness finally found dead at the
[1:15:28] age of 59 the police found his body in a
[1:15:32] room stru strung with peels and empty
[1:15:34] liquor bottles and so they they
[1:15:37] concluded after 12 day investigation an
[1:15:41] autopsy the coroner's report was Alan
[1:15:43] died from the liver failure brought on
[1:15:46] by acute alcoholism he had enough blood
[1:15:50] alcohol content of point 36 which was to
[1:15:53] ensure a deep coma this is how he comes
[1:15:57] to the end the Bible said their folly
[1:16:00] will be made known now if this wasn't
[1:16:05] enough now the pinnacle so started
[1:16:09] manufacturing tongues
[1:16:11] and impersonated the gift of tongues by
[1:16:13] confusing the language rather than
[1:16:17] having the experience a Pentecost they
[1:16:20] begin to have where they would teach you
[1:16:23] how to speak in tongues and you sink
[1:16:25] your chin and say Jesus over and over
[1:16:27] again real fast and do you had a
[1:16:29] confusion of language this is no
[1:16:31] Pentecost this was an impersonation now
[1:16:37] remember we're talking about the
[1:16:38] impersonations are rising and
[1:16:41] impersonators
[1:16:42] oh well Jagger's he was another Assembly
[1:16:46] of God preacher was so inspired by the
[1:16:48] miracles that he saw and brother Brad
[1:16:50] was meeting no doubt these amendments
[1:16:52] start off humbly but see him that he can
[1:16:56] be enriched by the crowds that were
[1:16:57] attracted not having an angelic
[1:17:00] visitation or the gifts he starts
[1:17:02] promoting the sale of blood and oil that
[1:17:05] he got from a woman's body and sold it
[1:17:07] for the purpose of healing next he's
[1:17:10] selling and marketing vitamins from the
[1:17:12] Dead Sea and then baptizing unto eternal
[1:17:15] life claiming that those he would
[1:17:17] baptize would never die that they they
[1:17:20] were dead they could never physically
[1:17:22] die there was that would be not baptized
[1:17:25] into eternal life now brother Randleman
[1:17:29] entice and spirits talks about this and
[1:17:31] he's dealing with all of these
[1:17:33] impersonations and this is 1955 that he
[1:17:36] mentions this he said people can jump up
[1:17:39] and down and shout on mine and speak in
[1:17:42] tongues like pouring Peas on a dry
[1:17:45] cowhide and walk out in the morning with
[1:17:47] enough temper to fight a buzzsaw and go
[1:17:50] right on and tell something in the
[1:17:52] church that it caused the whole church
[1:17:54] to be broke up is nothing in the world
[1:17:56] but enticing demon spirits oh did you
[1:18:02] hear that that's what we're we're out of
[1:18:04] the face in this in this time of
[1:18:06] darkness enticing spirits seducing
[1:18:10] spirits and doctrines of devils that all
[1:18:13] come out in the night of this Exodus he
[1:18:18] said they go out right out and tell us
[1:18:20] something that brings up the whole
[1:18:21] church and nothing in the world but in
[1:18:23] Tysons the
[1:18:24] the spirits want to come back to the
[1:18:26] word for its God is pure da man that's
[1:18:29] right in Tyson spirit and that verse in
[1:18:32] the Word of God there's a man not long
[1:18:34] ago got a little woman this was o L
[1:18:36] Jagger's he's talking about he said the
[1:18:38] Catholics got a dozen over there in the
[1:18:40] time of her menopause she comes out in
[1:18:42] her hands and in her forehead and if a
[1:18:45] good Holy Ghost preacher I thought that
[1:18:48] man that had a bottle of that stuff out
[1:18:51] of her hands going around and knowing
[1:18:53] people with it
[1:18:54] mercy its Antichrist I don't care the
[1:18:58] blood comes from her nose her head or
[1:19:00] where brother it's not blood that will
[1:19:03] take the place of Jesus Christ the Son
[1:19:05] of God that's the only blood I know she
[1:19:09] may have had oil in it pour out of one
[1:19:12] hand and wine out of the other but you
[1:19:14] use it in a form of religion it's the
[1:19:16] devil just see our preachers will fall
[1:19:20] for such as that what we need is to come
[1:19:22] back to the guidebook back to the Word
[1:19:25] of God this is the Word of God this
[1:19:27] blessed old Bible so well I'm afraid to
[1:19:30] become that brother branham I'm afraid
[1:19:32] I'll lose some of my joy he said what's
[1:19:34] the matter you don't know what joy is so
[1:19:38] then this is what brother Brennan said
[1:19:39] I'm not trying to take away your joy I'm
[1:19:42] trying to get your joy in a real
[1:19:45] experience with God
[1:19:47] and in Tison Spirit says hey you said I
[1:19:50] don't condemn a drunkard for going out
[1:19:52] and getting drunk he's all Moody and he
[1:19:54] don't know he gets that in the morning
[1:19:56] he's got the blues a hangover and goes
[1:19:58] out and gets him two or three bottles of
[1:20:00] beer and goes out gets him some whiskey
[1:20:03] and all kinds of stuff little cigarette
[1:20:05] suckers head back and smoke and bullet
[1:20:07] to his nose like he was a freight train
[1:20:09] I don't blame him that's all the joy he
[1:20:12] knows that's all he knows about he's a
[1:20:14] pig by Nature but shame on you but
[1:20:17] profess to be a Christian and rely on
[1:20:19] such things for joy when the Holy Ghost
[1:20:22] is nothing but one great big powerhouse
[1:20:25] of joy the Holy Ghost is a perfect
[1:20:28] intoxication for every man that's got
[1:20:30] the booze you can take a you'll drink a
[1:20:33] drink of the gospel of Jesus Christ I'm
[1:20:36] filled be filled with the whole
[1:20:37] goes you're drunk until you leave this
[1:20:41] world a man joy unspeakable and full of
[1:20:45] glory that's a constant stimulation it's
[1:20:48] a constant intoxication drunk day and
[1:20:52] night Amen that's the Word of God I'll
[1:20:56] tell you it's time some of us that are
[1:20:58] in this Passover take another good drink
[1:21:01] of the wine of the life the blood of
[1:21:04] Christ and get a new free filling of the
[1:21:06] Holy Ghost and stay drunk on that where
[1:21:11] it changes your vision of the world
[1:21:12] changes our vision about sin and
[1:21:16] iniquity and the things that are going
[1:21:18] on it gives you a view like God has
[1:21:21] because you're influenced by the wine
[1:21:23] that you're drinking now because of the
[1:21:30] impersonators now brother branham is
[1:21:34] ready to quit the ministry he has a
[1:21:37] vision of the third pole the tenth
[1:21:42] vision we're not going to go and cover
[1:21:44] it all of that but I want you to
[1:21:46] remember that when it comes into that
[1:21:48] third pull of his ministry he sees a
[1:21:52] place a little room where miracles are
[1:21:56] being performed in this little room out
[1:21:59] of the view in the eyes of the
[1:22:01] impersonators so he's telling us the
[1:22:08] third pull when you really come into
[1:22:10] this world when you really get into
[1:22:12] Christ nobody can impersonate that said
[1:22:19] they've impersonated these other gifts
[1:22:21] but this they will never impersonate
[1:22:24] Satan we'll never get it now but he also
[1:22:28] saw the church had come away that had to
[1:22:32] come away from the carnal impersonating
[1:22:36] the Holy Ghost because now this is what
[1:22:38] was happening they were impersonating
[1:22:40] the gifts and they were impersonating
[1:22:43] the Holy Ghost and Pentecost had turned
[1:22:46] into a huge a huge Rauh of just him
[1:22:49] person Asians they're impersonating the
[1:22:52] Holy Ghost down at the altar
[1:22:54] bringing and bringing about a forced
[1:22:57] confusion of language you know hitting
[1:23:01] them on the head and saying Jesus over
[1:23:03] again then taking their their chanting
[1:23:06] and jiggling that until he gets a
[1:23:08] confusion of language and call that the
[1:23:11] Holy Ghost and yet they don't have that
[1:23:13] hip life yet they never enter into
[1:23:17] Passover brother Brendan said meaner
[1:23:21] something mean to come out there you
[1:23:24] know meaner that and with a temper of
[1:23:27] the fight a buzz saw there's no nature
[1:23:29] change that's what he's trying to say
[1:23:32] but in this brother Brandon began to
[1:23:34] preach on what Pentecost failed he would
[1:23:37] look at the whole thing to hold divine
[1:23:39] healing healing movement and he said
[1:23:41] here's why I failed and I like I said I
[1:23:46] pondered I looked at it a lot of times
[1:23:49] how come in how come it came up and and
[1:23:52] then died how come it rose up and just a
[1:23:56] little short time they all melt back in
[1:23:59] organizations why is it that the great
[1:24:04] campaigns would just you know go out and
[1:24:09] he would see it that they would have
[1:24:10] more emphasis on on money than the altar
[1:24:14] call and then he see began to preach on
[1:24:18] why Pentecost fail and in this message
[1:24:21] he's preaching about adoption and he
[1:24:24] says it wouldn't grow up into Christ but
[1:24:27] we're just perpetuating their babyhood
[1:24:30] I want to get something to you this
[1:24:32] Passover is not perpetuating your
[1:24:34] babyhood it's not just remaining an
[1:24:38] infant Christian immature all the time
[1:24:41] it's growing in Christ is maturing in
[1:24:45] Christ it's it's gotten straight from
[1:24:47] the lamb if you know you're not staying
[1:24:50] in the weakened condition remember I
[1:24:53] talked about the little woman the 90
[1:24:56] year old laying in the bed granny this
[1:24:58] time
[1:24:59] need a bite of this lamb she didn't
[1:25:01] remain the same drink came into her for
[1:25:05] the journey and I'm trying to tell you
[1:25:07] you know you cannot remain a weak
[1:25:10] Christian with a stunted growth in your
[1:25:13] life my man but it must be a constant
[1:25:18] fellowship and a strengthening and
[1:25:21] growing going from strength to strength
[1:25:23] and from glory to glory remember that
[1:25:27] Paul said it that way he didn't say you
[1:25:29] looked in the word you get weaker and
[1:25:31] weaker
[1:25:32] he said you look in the mirror of this
[1:25:34] word and you are changed from glory unto
[1:25:38] glory well I'm trying to tell you you
[1:25:41] know all of us we need to reach out for
[1:25:44] another glory the glory of yesterday was
[1:25:47] great remember it's time for another
[1:25:50] glory is that what bloody Tim you know
[1:25:53] you you told me the other day and
[1:25:55] convinced me oh I'll have the Holy Ghost
[1:25:57] that was him working there and whatever
[1:25:59] listen I'm trying to I'm not trying to
[1:26:02] convince you of anything I'm trying to
[1:26:04] tell you you've got to have a consert
[1:26:07] fellowship with Christ not a
[1:26:10] one-and-done experience
[1:26:16] you see Ephraim wanted to he would
[1:26:18] explain it he from wanted to plant corn
[1:26:20] in manassas field in other words
[1:26:22] everybody wanted a healing ministry for
[1:26:25] the money and the fame that went with it
[1:26:27] but what they needed was to grow up into
[1:26:31] the fullness of the Holy Ghost he
[1:26:34] preached I'm not a message one of my
[1:26:36] favorite sermons you want to go to it
[1:26:39] it's not my most favorite but one of the
[1:26:41] greatest ones that I have fed over and
[1:26:44] pondered over and wrote out notes on and
[1:26:47] just bathing all through the years is
[1:26:50] the impersonation of Christianity and
[1:26:52] their brother branham would tell us that
[1:26:55] the Christian life was being
[1:26:58] impersonated by claims of sinking the
[1:27:01] preachers hand her easy believe is amore
[1:27:04] some kind of fanatical sensation yet
[1:27:07] lives were not changed instead there was
[1:27:09] a cheap impersonation of the gospel
[1:27:14] now remember everybody's not going in
[1:27:17] the Exodus
[1:27:18] it's only for the elected I realize in
[1:27:24] that Exodus that was a mixed multitude
[1:27:26] that win but that is the way it's going
[1:27:28] to be in this Exodus only the elect of
[1:27:32] God is going in the rapture hey man now
[1:27:36] this is what brother Branham said in in
[1:27:38] the rapture message he said now so were
[1:27:41] you if you got eternal life
[1:27:42] you weren't God before there ever was a
[1:27:45] world you're a part of son of God an
[1:27:47] attribute of God he knew that very easy
[1:27:50] were coming he predestinated you to that
[1:27:53] age somebody ought to take comfort in
[1:27:54] that a man to take that place and no one
[1:27:58] else can do take it care how many
[1:28:00] impersonation and things you got to be
[1:28:03] there because he knew you would be there
[1:28:04] now you are made manifest and now you
[1:28:07] can fellowship with him and that's what
[1:28:09] he wants he's longing for fellowship to
[1:28:12] be worship but if your life that did not
[1:28:15] always was an attribute in God you're
[1:28:17] just a mimic of Christianity and there
[1:28:20] will be millions and billions of them
[1:28:22] that are just being mimics of
[1:28:25] Christianity and I'll tell you we got
[1:28:28] millions who are claiming Christianity
[1:28:31] today and they're just mimics sheep
[1:28:36] reproductions imitations impersonations
[1:28:42] but I read of a rapture or somebody's
[1:28:46] going to be real and that's what gives
[1:28:50] me some hope for you and you and you and
[1:28:53] you and you they're there somebody gonna
[1:28:56] be real in this age there's somebody
[1:28:59] gonna be like Enoch whose name was
[1:29:01] dedicated who walked with God
[1:29:04] hey man now
[1:29:07] some brother branham with treats they
[1:29:08] hidden life with Christ the same the
[1:29:11] same thing he'd he would name it a lot
[1:29:14] of different things he would show why
[1:29:16] the people why some can't keep the
[1:29:19] victory that's another title Nene in
[1:29:22] explain that matter isn't lasting there
[1:29:24] you know what they're eating oh they're
[1:29:27] running out of it it's going to stay
[1:29:29] open breeding worms right and he says
[1:29:33] they're light they're light it keeps
[1:29:35] going out and because he said you know
[1:29:38] it hasn't it just has to have a constant
[1:29:41] care to the lampstand and it keeps going
[1:29:44] out but he said you know but come he
[1:29:47] said into the holiest of Holies notice
[1:29:50] into the secret place coming to the
[1:29:54] house cut there behind the token come
[1:29:59] and buy and shut the door and the world
[1:30:02] sealed off the veil closed combine the
[1:30:06] veil and there there's a pot of manna
[1:30:09] that is the same manner that was there
[1:30:12] on the day of Pentecost and this manna
[1:30:15] never runs out and it never grows old
[1:30:19] it never gets failed it's always fresh
[1:30:25] coming through the inside come into this
[1:30:28] inside with Christ because in here the
[1:30:31] light doesn't go out it's a Shekinah
[1:30:34] glory and it never fades
[1:30:37] it never dims out it never grows even
[1:30:40] they'd never have Saba a refilling you
[1:30:44] know of oil to keep it going it's always
[1:30:46] constant delight the holy ghost a mile
[1:30:52] in there behind the veil as he would
[1:30:55] explain it even a dead stick had come to
[1:30:58] life and blossom and boom and you can
[1:31:01] come there dead a man in your sins and
[1:31:05] trespasses and come through the washing
[1:31:07] of the water of the word and then there
[1:31:10] behind the veil and once you come in
[1:31:12] that veil you can't remain dead remember
[1:31:17] to god you're gonna be like Aaron's rod
[1:31:19] your blossom and bear fruit and that's
[1:31:24] what God's warning in this hour of
[1:31:26] people that are producing his life this
[1:31:29] is the age
[1:31:30] the literal life of Christ this shows
[1:31:38] that we must be in Passover sealed away
[1:31:41] with Christ where you're sealed in
[1:31:44] Satan's sealed out where the constant
[1:31:47] fellowship with Jesus my man this shows
[1:31:51] that the hidden life where one is in
[1:31:54] Passover will not be impersonated and
[1:31:59] you might impersonate one or two little
[1:32:00] things but you can't live the hidden
[1:32:03] life now the life of Christ must be
[1:32:09] present
[1:32:11] now the commandment was you stay in the
[1:32:14] house and don't leave you don't allow
[1:32:17] under the protection of the blood until
[1:32:20] you're called out in the rapture this
[1:32:22] must be eating and the state of
[1:32:24] preparedness and ready to go and from
[1:32:28] the slaying of the lamb of the Passover
[1:32:30] lamb at Calvary now I want you to take
[1:32:33] it back the impulse said Christ is our
[1:32:35] Passover so now from password from
[1:32:41] taking the lamb slain until he comes
[1:32:45] back we are in Passover a man going back
[1:32:53] again all the way from there till now
[1:32:56] we're not to eat we're not to eat 11
[1:32:59] bread come on we're not to partake of
[1:33:02] sin we're to be in fellowship with
[1:33:05] Christ we're to drink of His Holy Spirit
[1:33:10] this would happen from Calvary to now
[1:33:13] every member of the bride of every age
[1:33:17] had to come in this relationship now so
[1:33:22] you see Anne from Calgary to now from
[1:33:26] the time of the slaying of the lamb and
[1:33:29] the and the sending of Christ and him
[1:33:31] going away it has been night and we must
[1:33:36] say and pass over until the trumpet
[1:33:39] sounds in the morning now look the next
[1:33:45] Exodus 12 and verse 22 and you shall
[1:33:49] take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the
[1:33:51] blood that's in the basin strike the
[1:33:54] lentil and the two side posts with the
[1:33:55] blood the Sun that's in the basin and
[1:33:58] none of you none of you kind of say it
[1:34:01] again none of you shall go out at the
[1:34:04] door of his house on the morning so
[1:34:07] notice shall the blood
[1:34:09] you don't need snake oil I mean you
[1:34:12] don't need an impersonation we have the
[1:34:16] blood and if you don't have the blood
[1:34:18] get out of that and find somewhere that
[1:34:20] the blood is mine we have the Holy Ghost
[1:34:23] and it must be applied strike the
[1:34:27] doorpost the two side posts strike the
[1:34:30] lentil a man with the blood that's in

[1:35:57] and none of you said none of you shall
[1:36:02] go out of that door of his house until
[1:36:04] morning
[1:36:05] now watch this is important
[1:36:08] brother branham would preach the sermons
[1:36:10] Watchmen water the night he would do
[1:36:13] this from Isaiah 21 11 the burden of
[1:36:17] Douma he called it to me out of Seir
[1:36:21] watzmann what are the night watchmen
[1:36:25] what are the night the watchman said the
[1:36:29] morning cometh and also the night if you
[1:36:32] inquire inquire ye return come brother
[1:36:36] Branham would preach from this sermon or
[1:36:38] this this passage in Isaiah watzmann
[1:36:42] what are the night because he's
[1:36:44] established and we're in the night but
[1:36:48] there's a morning coming and that's
[1:36:51] where I want you to look out today is is
[1:36:54] you know no matter how dark it is no
[1:36:56] matter how many impersonation demons run
[1:36:59] into the street and the Death Angel is
[1:37:01] howling everywhere but oh brother the
[1:37:04] night will not last all the time there's
[1:37:09] a morning coming and we're right here in
[1:37:13] the last watch before the morning Dawn's
[1:37:18] Oh hallelujah we're in a time it meant
[1:37:25] dawn is a time where it's morning yet
[1:37:27] it's night it's morning yet it's not
[1:37:29] it's morning yet it's night you get up
[1:37:33] early in the morning for the Sun is up
[1:37:36] you say it's morning good morning
[1:37:37] everybody well you know you know it's
[1:37:41] not light outside The Sun ain't up it's
[1:37:44] still dark but yeah this morning and
[1:37:50] we're in the wee hours of the morning
[1:37:55] well that bright and cloudless morning
[1:37:58] when the dead in Christ shall rise and
[1:38:02] where in the morning we're in the dawn
[1:38:09] hadn't yet broke yet the dead in Christ
[1:38:12] ain't here yet he hadn't come yet but
[1:38:19] he's announcing his coming and he's for
[1:38:22] running his coming and he's telling you
[1:38:26] the day is about to dawn be awake it's
[1:38:32] not a time to sleep Watchmen
[1:38:37] what of the night now the Jews had three
[1:38:38] watches they would last respectfully
[1:38:41] from 10 p.m. from sin sunset to 10 p.m.
[1:38:45] from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. from 2 a.m. to
[1:38:48] sunrise so that would be the third watch
[1:38:51] from 2 a.m. to sunrise and then with the
[1:38:57] establishment of the Roman supremacy the
[1:38:59] number of watches including an increase
[1:39:01] two to four and this is what you read
[1:39:03] about in the in the New Testament when
[1:39:05] you hear about the case of the fourth
[1:39:07] Watson Matthew 14 25 and are the terms
[1:39:11] even of midnight crowing in morning
[1:39:14] and these would terminate respectfully
[1:39:17] at 9:00 p.m. and then at midnight 3 a.m.
[1:39:20] and 6 a.m. so their mornings or their
[1:39:23] watches was different and I want to get
[1:39:27] it to you I watched the watts of this
[1:39:30] night is different it is seven watches
[1:39:37] because each age had a watch and a
[1:39:43] watchman and each messenger of every age
[1:39:50] would bring a message of the condition
[1:39:53] of the night the rapture message brother
[1:39:58] Branham tells us notice inna the type of
[1:40:01] the church here he's also typed in the
[1:40:03] 7th church age can you think of that the
[1:40:05] 738 notice that the sounding
[1:40:08] how many believes are seven messengers
[1:40:11] so the four the seven churches or we
[1:40:14] will all believe it if we believe the
[1:40:16] Bible if we don't believe the Bible
[1:40:17] course we don't believe it but there has
[1:40:19] been and we're living in the seventh
[1:40:22] church age and when the Bible said this
[1:40:25] seventh church age when the messenger
[1:40:27] the seventh church age begins the
[1:40:28] sounders message that the mysteries all
[1:40:31] these things that's been twisted up all
[1:40:33] down to the age would be revealed in
[1:40:35] that time and here we see it the Son of
[1:40:38] man coming among his people doing
[1:40:40] exactly kin and confirming his message
[1:40:44] as he said he would do and here we find
[1:40:47] it in this last age and the seven
[1:40:49] watches notice seven watches like the
[1:40:52] seven watts of one come he didn't come
[1:40:55] into first watch second watch third
[1:40:57] fourth but come in the seventh watch
[1:40:59] that was Enoch the seventh which was
[1:41:02] translated Noah being a type of the
[1:41:04] remnant of the Jews is to be carried
[1:41:06] over now in the Bible times talking
[1:41:08] about the watches and there were nights
[1:41:10] were not delivered in two hours in in
[1:41:13] Bible time the night was not that was
[1:41:15] not divided in the hours in Bible time
[1:41:17] he was divided it watches and there were
[1:41:19] three watches but in ours there's seven
[1:41:23] it's night but morning comes none of you
[1:41:30] go out of the door till morning until
[1:41:35] morning finally gets here until the
[1:41:38] trumpet sounds don't get out from behind
[1:41:42] the bug stay in Passover eating the lamb
[1:41:47] I Passover and keeping the leaven out
[1:41:50] but it's not morning yet the world is in
[1:41:55] darkness and we've got light because of
[1:41:57] the seventh the seventh star in the
[1:42:00] seventh golden candlestick now I know
[1:42:04] there's something that are getting a
[1:42:05] hurry saying well the nights already
[1:42:06] over we're no longer even in the church
[1:42:09] ages but that's not true
[1:42:10] someone to pretend they've already been
[1:42:12] raptured also that the lamb has let the
[1:42:15] mercy see because the seals are open but
[1:42:17] are they true
[1:42:18] that's impersonators
[1:42:20] we're stealing in the night of the
[1:42:23] church ASIS we are as morning stars
[1:42:27] reflecting and announcing the coven day
[1:42:31] man the morning isn't fully here until
[1:42:34] the dead in Christ Rises some just tell
[1:42:36] you we don't leave the seventh angels
[1:42:39] message and we stay in the house under
[1:42:42] the token until the trumpet sounds and
[1:42:45] my watchman was like a morning star his
[1:42:50] for running and announcing the coming
[1:42:52] Sun so so this message was a afar
[1:42:56] running of the coming of the morning of
[1:43:00] the Resurrection and the literal coming
[1:43:04] of Jesus Christ oh my that's why this is
[1:43:09] why there are stars and lampstands
[1:43:12] how many remembers in Revelation chapter
[1:43:15] one and remembers that in the Bible
[1:43:17] where that rule one and two it tells
[1:43:20] about seven golden candlesticks seven
[1:43:23] stars right hey man we know that reply
[1:43:28] word that speaks of seven church ages
[1:43:31] seven lamps of fire right all of these
[1:43:35] things that that are speaking up and
[1:43:37] brother Branham would tell us in the
[1:43:39] pathless vision he stands amidst the
[1:43:41] lamb stands with the stars in his hands
[1:43:44] remember seven stars in the hands of
[1:43:46] Jehovah his night but that's when we use
[1:43:51] lamps for light and that is when the
[1:43:55] stars are seen shining and reflected the
[1:43:58] light of the Sun and it's dark and the
[1:44:01] church is walking by faith in the
[1:44:03] darkness her Lord has departed from the
[1:44:06] earth but the Holy Spirit still shines
[1:44:09] through the church you see the Sun left
[1:44:12] the Son of God has sended and we went
[1:44:16] into a time of the absence of the Sun
[1:44:19] and in his absence he would send seven
[1:44:22] stars seven messages come on he would
[1:44:26] send seven lampstands all of us to give
[1:44:30] a light in his apps
[1:44:33] so as long as he's not here and then
[1:44:37] we've got to have the stars for light
[1:44:40] till the Sun rises until Jesus comes
[1:44:43] back so now he said her Lord departed
[1:44:47] this earth but the Holy Spirit is still
[1:44:49] shines out to the church giving light to
[1:44:52] this old cinders world and these stars
[1:44:55] reflect his light also the only light
[1:44:57] they have is his life how dark it is how
[1:45:00] spiritually cold yet when he comes into
[1:45:03] the myths it's light and warm and the
[1:45:06] church is empowered and through him does
[1:45:09] the works that he did he would say again
[1:45:12] in the fees in church age he is there he
[1:45:15] is with seven stars in his right hand
[1:45:18] the right hand or arm signifies the
[1:45:21] power and authority of God sums 44 and
[1:45:24] 3/4 they got nothing but the land in
[1:45:27] possession by their own sword neither
[1:45:29] did their own arms save them but thy
[1:45:32] right hand and I'm armed and the light
[1:45:35] of the countenance because thou has
[1:45:37] favored unto them in that in that right
[1:45:41] hand of power seven stars we who
[1:45:44] according to revelations 120 or seven
[1:45:48] church messengers they're angels to the
[1:45:51] church messengers Angelo's earthly
[1:45:54] messengers this signifies that the very
[1:45:56] power and authority of God are behind
[1:46:00] his messenger to every age and they go
[1:46:03] forth and fire and power the Holy Ghost
[1:46:06] with the word and their stars because
[1:46:08] they reflect light and the light they
[1:46:11] reflect is his light and they have no
[1:46:13] light of their own that Kendall not
[1:46:15] their own fires that man may walk in the
[1:46:18] light of their sparks Isaiah 51 it is
[1:46:21] our 11 it is night for that is when the
[1:46:25] stars come out it is that it is night of
[1:46:28] the blackness of sin for even the whole
[1:46:31] world has sinned and are constantly
[1:46:33] falling short of the glory of God there
[1:46:36] you are so watchman what are the night
[1:46:40] and he said the Holy Spirit is that
[1:46:43] watchman
[1:46:43] now I want you to notice
[1:46:45] spirits of God anointing seven
[1:46:48] messengers and man one Holy Spirit
[1:46:52] manifests himself in seven different
[1:46:54] ways to seven different Church ages a
[1:46:58] man we have been under the watchman of
[1:47:01] the Holy Ghost God using his messengers
[1:47:05] to tell us and warn us of the dangers of
[1:47:08] the night are you with me hey man Luther
[1:47:13] would do that and tell him that I see a
[1:47:15] dark horse coming and he's selling
[1:47:18] novenas and he's selling this and he's
[1:47:20] selling that don't go fallin after him
[1:47:22] his death
[1:47:23] hey man I read his for sale I seemed
[1:47:27] coming out and he's got a sword in his
[1:47:29] hand and his slaughter sixty-eight
[1:47:31] million because of the are they there

[1:49:22] lives when you see the people becoming
[1:49:26] desperate for his touch the source of
[1:49:35] life I being safe in his presence man
[1:49:39] that ought to give us something to
[1:49:41] rejoice about when we see the Holy Ghost

[1:50:06] man that's what we've been looking for

[1:50:34] and they're given in marriage just that
[1:50:36] God said to be in no way of stopping

[1:55:31] thief in the night the morning comes
[1:55:42] that's the Comfort wherefore comfort one
[1:55:46] another with these words
[1:55:49] the Lord Himself the light will come
[1:55:53] again The Sun will come
[1:55:56] he'll descend from heaven with a shout
[1:55:59] with a voice with a drop look at perfect
[1:56:07] harmony with the scripture that Isaiah
[1:56:10] was in the regular course of nature
[1:56:12] always that the approaching of the Sun
[1:56:15] congeals the darkness together makes it
[1:56:17] dark
[1:56:18] he's darkened before the day than any
[1:56:20] other time in the night why it is
[1:56:22] approaching light that's making it dark
[1:56:24] and it's approaching of the Lord Jesus
[1:56:27] now that's a bringing this gloom upon
[1:56:30] the earth did not he say when these
[1:56:32] things become they come to pass lift up
[1:56:35] your head for your Redemption draweth
[1:56:38] nigh Palestine is a nation the Jews of
[1:56:41] life returned from all over the earth
[1:56:43] and her place there to seem come as God
[1:56:46] said they would learn the parable of the
[1:56:48] fig tree when he put forth his buds he
[1:56:50] said so will it be and that this
[1:56:52] generation shall not cease shall not be
[1:56:55] done away with it shall never end until
[1:56:57] all these things be done now it's today
[1:57:00] that we're living in the watzmann what
[1:57:03] of the night he said it would be a time
[1:57:05] like it wasn't sodom and gomorrah tell
[1:57:08] me aren't you coming out in the night
[1:57:10] aren't to beating on the door everywhere
[1:57:13] aren't they demanded their rights aren't
[1:57:16] they trying to push right down on
[1:57:18] righteous lots around to try to force
[1:57:21] themselves
[1:57:22] even into his into his home to defile
[1:57:25] the very angels of God isn't Sodom and
[1:57:31] Gomorrah I've never had internet in our
[1:57:35] schools isn't it be puts in our colleges
[1:57:39] isn't it been priests in our society
[1:57:45] what of the night its Sodom out there
[1:57:48] just before the fire burns now the Sun
[1:57:58] leaving the earth that leaves the moon
[1:58:01] to take care in the moon shines in the
[1:58:03] absence of the Sun because the light
[1:58:06] that we walk in the light of the Sun
[1:58:08] reflected from the moon now that's what
[1:58:11] the church is supposed to do reflect the
[1:58:13] presence of this of God while the Sun is
[1:58:15] gone and then when the Sun comes up and
[1:58:19] the moon is gone just before day did you
[1:58:22] notice the moon gets real pale and it
[1:58:23] goes out and I'm telling you the church
[1:58:26] has already paled it's anemic it's got
[1:58:29] away from the blood it's got away from
[1:58:30] salvation and the Holy Ghost and the
[1:58:32] teaching of the word and it's become
[1:58:34] anemic my man and just cause we got a
[1:58:38] message sign on our churches don't keep
[1:58:40] it out a man because it got away from
[1:58:44] the blood they got away from salvation
[1:58:47] got away from the Holy Ghost got away
[1:58:49] from the real truth of the word goes
[1:58:53] down what happens the Sun is approaching
[1:58:57] then that doubt darkest hour the night
[1:58:58] is this before dawned salius science
[1:59:01] claims it's the night the Sun is
[1:59:04] approaching pressing coming on pressing
[1:59:05] congealing the night together because it
[1:59:08] knows it's got just a little while and
[1:59:10] the day will break and just before
[1:59:12] daybreak what comes out the morning star
[1:59:15] a man now that morning star means the
[1:59:20] brother to the Messiah he's not the
[1:59:24] Messiah just a brother to Messiah and
[1:59:26] the morning star is a herald of the dawn
[1:59:29] he is saying look
[1:59:32] here and then I'm up here I'm above the
[1:59:34] world I'm up here but I'm where the like
[1:59:37] concern on me
[1:59:38] and I'm signing back to the darkest dark
[1:59:41] a night he's coming somebody with me now
[1:59:46] that's what God did by swinging a
[1:59:49] prophet he was a hell that the down he
[1:59:53] was announcing that the son Jesus Christ
[1:59:57] is coming back to the earth and that's
[1:59:59] why the miracles of science of wonder
[2:00:02] everything else
[2:00:03] it was announcing that Jesus was coming
[2:00:06] with this power it was the Sun of
[2:00:09] righteousness
[2:00:10] shiny with healing in his wings now
[2:00:16] moving the darkness away now for the
[2:00:21] church we tour to be morning stars we're
[2:00:26] to be announcing his coming the light
[2:00:29] shining on us not dark like the world
[2:00:32] the light shining on us reflecting back
[2:00:34] to the world that there is a greater
[2:00:36] light coming and you are to be a
[2:00:39] reflection of that light that's what her
[2:00:42] to be doing in this Passover is
[2:00:44] reflecting the literal life of Jesus
[2:00:46] Christ a man now oh he said all morning
[2:00:51] stars rise and shine it's time to say
[2:00:54] the coming of the Lord is at hand
[2:00:57] reflecting his presence reflecting the
[2:00:59] uncommon Sun given the same signs jesus
[2:01:02] said it was as it was in the days of
[2:01:04] Sodom it'll be the same thing in the
[2:01:06] coming of the Son of Man the same
[2:01:08] ministry the Sun went down in the same
[2:01:11] light he went down in his coming in the
[2:01:13] resurrection power and the morning stars
[2:01:15] reflecting that light and we cry what
[2:01:18] ceman what are the night the morning
[2:01:20] cometh and the night also and now we're
[2:01:23] in the dark time the Laodicean Church
[2:01:26] age man is lukewarm not able to stand
[2:01:28] the things of God that pull themselves
[2:01:30] off separating like it was in the days
[2:01:33] of Noah but the morning star signs right
[2:01:36] on them just the same the power of God
[2:01:40] the Holy Spirit though jesus said the
[2:01:42] what should I do shall you
[2:01:44] also and greater than these say you do
[2:01:47] for I go to my father he promised the
[2:01:49] power little while world will not see me
[2:01:52] no more but you'll see me there God's
[2:01:55] light will be reflected in his church
[2:01:57] and more powerful than ever just before
[2:02:00] the coming of the Lord Jesus watzmann
[2:02:03] what are the night hey man
[2:02:06] oh ma listen now I'm gonna try to bring
[2:02:10] down a few more points now just hang on
[2:02:12] but in the Laodicean age he says yes
[2:02:15] this age boast see they're just like the
[2:02:19] spirit of these impersonators boast of
[2:02:22] these tremendous doors of worldly goods
[2:02:25] but the people are less happy than ever
[2:02:28] this Saints blows of its spiritual
[2:02:31] attainments but people are less sure of
[2:02:33] themselves than ever
[2:02:35] this ain't Bruce a better moral values
[2:02:38] and more corrupt than any age since the
[2:02:40] flood it talks about its knowledge and
[2:02:43] its science but it's fighting a losing
[2:02:45] battle in all fields for the human mind
[2:02:48] and soul and spirit cannot comprehend or
[2:02:51] keep abreast with all the changes that
[2:02:54] are come up on the earth in one
[2:02:56] generation we've gone all the way from
[2:02:57] horse and buggy Age to the species we
[2:03:01] are proud and boastful about it but
[2:03:03] there's a dark void a cavern that is
[2:03:07] crying out in torment and without a
[2:03:09] known reason men's hearts are failing
[2:03:12] for fear and the world is so darkened
[2:03:14] that this age could be well called the
[2:03:17] age of neurotics and it's only getting
[2:03:21] crazier it boasts but it cannot back it
[2:03:25] up in Christ peace and there is no peace
[2:03:27] it cries great aptitude of all things
[2:03:30] and it keeps burdened with a desire like
[2:03:33] an unsatisfied fire there is no peace
[2:03:36] saith my god to the wicked they are
[2:03:39] miserable that means their objects to be
[2:03:41] pitied pitied they scorn pity they're
[2:03:45] full of pride they've want what they
[2:03:47] have but then what they have will not
[2:03:49] stand the test of time they are built
[2:03:52] upon quicksand
[2:03:53] rather than the rock or the revelation
[2:03:55] of God's Word
[2:03:57] come at the earthquake soon that will
[2:03:59] come the storms or the wrath of God in
[2:04:01] judgment then come a sudden destruction
[2:04:03] and in spite of all their common
[2:04:06] preparation they're still unprepared for
[2:04:08] what comes on the earth and I'll just
[2:04:10] tell you they can't prepare you for this
[2:04:13] Exodus and let me just give a message to
[2:04:17] all the Preppers out there that are
[2:04:19] preparing for all the terrible times
[2:04:21] coming you can't build a wall tall
[2:04:24] enough you can't dig a hole deep enough
[2:04:27] you can't provide enough food enough
[2:04:29] weapon you cannot do it there's only one
[2:04:33] thing that have prepared you for what's
[2:04:35] coming there and that's the escape that
[2:04:38] God comes provided it's called a rapture
[2:04:41] the coming of the Lord Jesus I know I
[2:04:48] know all about Preppers because my
[2:04:50] family was Preppers before it was
[2:04:52] popular they knew they leave they went
[2:04:56] out there got him a hundred and twenty
[2:04:57] acres where the bride could come and
[2:04:59] write we can escape tribulation and
[2:05:01] trouble that's coming in and all of this
[2:05:03] and it's not a place of safety
[2:05:11] everything we learn you know running
[2:05:14] after armadillos and how to cook them in
[2:05:16] meat and opossum and raccoon and living
[2:05:19] off the land and nature and all of that
[2:05:21] is nonsense means nothing it amounts to
[2:05:27] nothing there's only one thing to
[2:05:31] prepare you and that's this preparation
[2:05:33] I'm telling you about get in that secret
[2:05:37] place with Jesus you can't fortify your
[2:05:44] family except behind the blood you can't
[2:05:48] protect them listen you can try to
[2:05:51] protect them or you want to but you
[2:05:53] can't protect them from you right you
[2:05:56] can't protect them from demons there's
[2:05:59] only one thing they'll protect him and
[2:06:01] that's the blood
[2:06:03] that's why ever house must come under
[2:06:06] the blood vii watch for the seventh

[2:15:10] God dealing with the Gentiles and
[2:15:12] calling out a Gentile bride to himself

[2:15:17] makes the church ages in the fullness of
[2:15:19] the Gentiles the one of the same thing
[2:15:21] so when the church age is over the
[2:15:23] fullness of the Gentiles is over the
[2:15:26] Gentile dispensation is to be finished
[2:15:28] with the church age the church ages are
[2:15:31] represented by seven golden candlesticks
[2:15:33] who walketh in the midst of the candles
[2:15:36] seven golden candlesticks
[2:15:37] Christ is in their midst one should
[2:15:41] understand Oh a lever Church aids crisis
[2:15:43] in the myths Christ walks in the midst

[2:15:55] present behold him is even now walking

[2:16:04] the midst of the last ages candlestick
[2:16:08] oh he's still here how is he here in the
[2:16:12] form of his Holy Spirit not in his
[2:16:15] corporal coming now he stands in the
[2:16:18] midst of the church as he stands there
[2:16:20] revealed who he is in this last age with
[2:16:25] him in her myths with him motivating her
[2:16:28] she becomes a wonderment of all his
[2:16:31] party and the fullness of him that
[2:16:34] filleth all in all somebody say a man
[2:16:37] that's why he could look right down to
[2:16:40] the last stage we'll all would be over
[2:16:42] and see himself still in the midst of
[2:16:45] the church as the author of this new
[2:16:47] creation he predestinated them to the
[2:16:51] adoption of children according to the
[2:16:53] good pleasure of his will by his a
[2:16:56] missus an up nipping it he brought it to
[2:16:58] pass how else could he know that he
[2:17:01] would be standing the midst of the
[2:17:03] church receiving glory from his brethren
[2:17:05] if he did not make sure what he was as
[2:17:10] he walked in the first days he is even
[2:17:14] now in this last age Jesus Christ the
[2:17:17] same yesterday today and forever for
[2:17:21] seven out of seven ages I said I've seen
[2:17:25] nothing but men esteem in their own word
[2:17:27] above mine and certainly that happened
[2:17:29] among the impersonators so at the end of
[2:17:32] this age I'm spilling you all out of my
[2:17:34] mouth it is all over I'm gonna speak
[2:17:37] alright yes I'm in the midst of the
[2:17:39] church the a man of God faithful and
[2:17:42] true will reveal himself and it will be
[2:17:45] by my prophet in this last day there is
[2:17:50] to be a prophet there is but one prophet
[2:17:53] messenger to this age there is what this
[2:17:56] one in Revelation 10 7 is a seventh age
[2:18:00] messenger
[2:18:01] and in the days of the voice of the
[2:18:03] seventh and messenger when he said
[2:18:05] beginning the mister of God to be
[2:18:08] finished as he hath declared his
[2:18:10] servants of prophets notice revelation
[2:18:12] 10 107 all the mysteries are to be
[2:18:15] revealed to the bride by the messenger
[2:18:18] of the Laodicean church we stand in the
[2:18:22] Laodicean Church age the Prophet
[2:18:24] messenger of revelation 10 7 must
[2:18:27] already be in the land the seventh
[2:18:30] messenger and it is a man and he's going
[2:18:33] to be is to bring a message from God and
[2:18:36] his message and ministry is going to
[2:18:38] finish the mystery of God as he declared
[2:18:41] to his servants the prophets in the days
[2:18:43] of the Laodicean age the messenger will
[2:18:47] reveal the mysteries of God as revealed
[2:18:49] to Paul and now in this age we'll come
[2:18:52] back to the capstone revelation the most
[2:18:55] important revelation of Godhead in the
[2:18:58] whole Bible in this days of Laodicean
[2:19:01] age that messenger will reveal the
[2:19:03] mysteries as revealed to Paul he will
[2:19:06] bring back the elect of the last day and
[2:19:08] they will hear vindicated prophet give
[2:19:10] the exact truth as it was with Paul
[2:19:13] listen to the earth indicated prophet of
[2:19:16] God who appears in this last day what he
[2:19:19] says from God the bride will say the
[2:19:22] spirit and the prophet and the bride
[2:19:24] will be saying the same thing and what
[2:19:27] they say will have already been said in
[2:19:29] the word and neither can the word climb
[2:19:32] above any Laodicean Church age we're in
[2:19:36] the last stage not back in the
[2:19:38] Pentecostal age there we are over here
[2:19:41] in the last eight and the first stage
[2:19:43] began with the word which was Christ and
[2:19:45] the last ages to end with the word which
[2:19:48] is Christ those electrodes him and that
[2:19:51] day will be the ones who truly manifests
[2:19:54] the Lord and be his body and be his
[2:19:57] voice and perform his works the people
[2:20:01] of God are being made ready by the word
[2:20:03] of truth by the messenger to this age
[2:20:06] those who receive that prophet and
[2:20:08] become a bride of the last day the
[2:20:11] spirit and the prophet and the bride
[2:20:13] will be saying the same thing
[2:20:15] but it's also fact that the profit for
[2:20:18] the last days must be bringing an
[2:20:20] important message from God that will
[2:20:22] forerun the second coming of the Lord
[2:20:24] for by His Messenger were the hearts
[2:20:27] other by his message we're the hearts of
[2:20:29] the children be turned back to the
[2:20:32] Pentecostal father's and with the
[2:20:34] restoration of the word will come the
[2:20:37] restoration of power thus this church
[2:20:46] beginning in acts is God's blueprint for
[2:20:50] all ages
[2:20:51] until she closes out in the Laodicean
[2:20:53] age what sit carefully let every age
[2:20:56] take heed for what is going on is only
[2:20:58] the start that little tree that is
[2:21:01] what's planet is going to grow
[2:21:03] it's going to grow through the ages then
[2:21:06] this then is a message for every
[2:21:09] Christian through every age until Jesus
[2:21:12] comes the seventh age a very short one
[2:21:16] very short age gathers itself and
[2:21:20] gathers up and do itself for one quick
[2:21:23] work yet all the reality of Pentecost in
[2:21:26] the last days there will be a group
[2:21:29] raise up the true bride of the last day
[2:21:33] and she will listen to the Spirit that
[2:21:36] word has never failed in the mouth of
[2:21:39] believing Christians and then this last
[2:21:42] age is stronger and greater than ever in
[2:21:45] the two word bride it rare will be the
[2:21:49] fullness of Pentecost for the Spirit
[2:21:52] will breathe bringing the people right
[2:21:54] back to where they were at the beginning
[2:21:56] that is thus saith the Lord God isn't
[2:22:00] going to plan a new church but it's
[2:22:02] going to bring his original planning
[2:22:04] back to original seed this is the age of
[2:22:07] restoration it is age of the Venice
[2:22:10] cycle the Pentecostal age speaking of
[2:22:13] Azusa Street did not restore but God has
[2:22:16] to restore because he cannot deny his
[2:22:19] word this is not the resurrection of the
[2:22:22] church it is the restoration and God
[2:22:25] will bring take the church
[2:22:27] back to Pentecost of the beginning the
[2:22:30] age of the restoration by another
[2:22:33] outpouring like in the beginning in that
[2:22:35] day of gross darkness the light will
[2:22:38] return by the pure word and we will
[2:22:41] return to the power of Pentecost to
[2:22:43] welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ for
[2:22:46] in this this last season is going to go
[2:22:50] back to manifesting the pure word bride

[2:22:58] were spoken about right here this aids
[2:23:01] is 7 watts hey man now coming down this
[2:23:05] is a 45th snippet now so we come to this
[2:23:08] last stage the Laodicean age that is our
[2:23:11] age amen
[2:23:14] we are living on up here to the bride
[2:23:17] age that called it out of the church and
[2:23:19] getting it together for the rapture
[2:23:21] that's age we're now living we are
[2:23:24] living in the Laodicean age we are in
[2:23:28] the seventh church age before the king
[2:23:30] Texas throne we are worshiping now under
[2:23:33] the Feast of Tabernacles the seventh
[2:23:36] church age we are at the end of the
[2:23:39] seventh church age when I say them that
[2:23:41] doesn't mean it's this very hour this
[2:23:44] very minute this is the bride age this
[2:23:48] is evening light this is when Malachi 4
[2:23:51] must be fulfilled to follow God's
[2:23:53] pattern this is Luke 17 30 to be
[2:23:56] fulfilled
[2:23:57] the age in which the true church would
[2:24:00] be returned to be in the bride she was
[2:24:02] at Pentecost the first time there will
[2:24:05] come forth for the bride age for
[2:24:08] resurrection out of duck
[2:24:09] denominationalism will be a message that
[2:24:12] the full maturity of the word has
[2:24:14] returned back again in his full power
[2:24:17] hey man what a message I said what a
[2:24:20] message found that that there's a
[2:24:23] message a message that what that the
[2:24:26] full maturity the word has returned back

[2:24:34] grant to sit with me in my throne even
[2:24:36] as I overcame and sat down with my
[2:24:38] father in his throne we find the true
[2:24:40] vine true spirit true church people
[2:24:44] exalted to the very throne of God with
[2:24:47] the highest compliment ever paid to a
[2:24:50] humble steadfast spiritual group to be

[2:25:15] last of the seven Church ages what began
[2:25:18] at the first of vision age must and will
[2:25:20] come to full fruition and harvest in the
[2:25:23] last or Laodicean age the two vines
[2:25:26] where you'll define fruit both the true
[2:25:28] and the false find the corner wheat the
[2:25:31] bride wheat that fell into the ground
[2:25:33] and I see has come back to the original
[2:25:34] word grain again the Laodicean age comes
[2:25:38] in quickly bringing the rate wheat to
[2:25:40] harvest just at the end of the Laodicean
[2:25:44] age just before Jesus come the church
[2:25:46] would go back to go being a word seed
[2:25:50] bride being a wheat seed bride again and
[2:25:55] now we're right back like all nature
[2:25:57] acting right back to the original see
[2:26:01] right from one church to another and
[2:26:03] then this last stage here here we are
[2:26:06] right back to the original thing that
[2:26:09] fell in the day of Pentecost to fulfill
[2:26:11] every scripture the bride the church
[2:26:14] will mature and her ripeness will be an
[2:26:17] identification with the Lord by the
[2:26:20] means of the word in her head who will
[2:26:22] come to her in some mystery of godliness
[2:26:24] which indeed is Christ the original
[2:26:28] wheat seed a Pentecost was to come back
[2:26:31] in the last age and it's to mature at
[2:26:34] Laodicea this the true seed already
[2:26:37] maturing and then the harvests the
[2:26:41] Laodicean age is the harvest time
[2:26:44] of the gathering of the tears for the
[2:26:45] burning and the binding and the burnin
[2:26:48] and the gathering of the wheat for the
[2:26:49] Lord yet it is the harvest time in the
[2:26:51] wheat was also almost must mature and to
[2:26:56] her God is sending the prophet messenger
[2:26:58] with a vindicated ministry that he might
[2:27:01] be accepted by the elect they will hear
[2:27:04] him as the first church heard Paul and
[2:27:06] she will mature in the word on to
[2:27:09] becoming a word bride and the mighty
[2:27:11] works will be found in her that's always
[2:27:14] attended up on pure word and faith oh
[2:27:18] listen to this is not only that but this
[2:27:21] is resurrection our rapture our it was

[2:31:11] nowhere nowhere but the tribulation this
[2:31:21] is a time that calls for more sincerity
[2:31:23] more dedication more consecration but
[2:31:29] the musicians come because we're
[2:31:34] rejecting the message of the exodus
[2:31:36] there will be many many left behind I
[2:31:42] got said in Egypt there was a mixed
[2:31:44] multitude they left with Israel but not
[2:31:48] this time
[2:31:49] only those that are washed in the blood
[2:31:51] of Jesus filled with the Holy Ghost will
[2:31:55] go in this rapture Exodus you see in
[2:31:58] that time anybody could kill a lamb put
[2:32:01] their butt on the door and get behind it
[2:32:03] and escape the Death Angel it was
[2:32:06] physical so you could be an Egyptian and
[2:32:12] go kill a lamb put this blood you could
[2:32:16] go and you can also eat the lamb the
[2:32:18] Passover do all you can go through all
[2:32:20] the acts but in this time it ain't
[2:32:22] possible it's not a little blood it's
[2:32:26] the Holy Ghost and that Holy Ghost is
[2:32:31] required to go in this rapture to escape
[2:32:34] to come in judgments and those judgments
[2:32:37] will begin at the resurrection of the
[2:32:40] Dead I'm gonna leave you with something
[2:32:48] the Bible tells you they spent all their
[2:32:52] time bearing their dead
[2:32:54] want you to stand with me right now I
[2:33:00] spent their time burying their dead
[2:33:06] there would be mourning and death and
[2:33:09] dying all over the land of Egypt when
[2:33:14] morning Dawn's
[2:33:18] six sealed judgments of God began in the
[2:33:20] spiritual manner when the Church of
[2:33:23] Laodicea rejected a message it'll turn
[2:33:26] physical the things that they did in the
[2:33:30] plagues against the Jewish people
[2:33:34] driving there which simply drove them
[2:33:37] back to their homeland will return in
[2:33:40] vengeance as vials of poured out and if
[2:33:43] you look at the vials and the trumpets
[2:33:45] they parallel each other what happened
[2:33:47] and the water here happened the water
[2:33:48] there and the parallel each one of them
[2:33:51] all the way down to the seventh trumpets
[2:33:53] and the seven vials and what they did to
[2:33:56] God's people in the trumpets the dryer
[2:34:00] that slowly served the drive Israel back
[2:34:03] to their homeland where they murdered
[2:34:05] and killed six million Jews and no
[2:34:08] telling how many other people it'll be
[2:34:13] turned back in vengeance as a wrath of
[2:34:16] God begins to fall on this world and the
[2:34:19] vials of judgment are poured out it'll
[2:34:24] turn physical the rejection of the
[2:34:29] message for their deliverance began the
[2:34:35] judgment on the church in a spiritual
[2:34:38] manner forced out of people out of the
[2:34:42] church to go back to their homeland that
[2:34:44] we've been preaching about it will turn
[2:34:50] physical they'll pay for their rejection
[2:34:54] and the church who thinks they're under
[2:34:58] the blood but didn't really apply the
[2:35:01] blood you see they maybe they just got
[2:35:05] it in one realm or another and they
[2:35:07] never come into Passover and not hidden
[2:35:09] life but went on about just frolic we'll
[2:35:13] go into the tribulation and be punished
[2:35:15] for her deeds of rejecting the atonement
[2:35:17] of the blood that could have saved them
[2:35:22] that's what's happening in this dark
[2:35:24] hour now then Matthew 27:51
[2:35:31] play that song he's coming soon
[2:35:40] involved the tail of the temple was rent
[2:35:43] in twain from top to bottom and the
[2:35:47] earth did quake in the rocks rent and
[2:35:51] the graves were opened and many of the
[2:35:55] bodies which slept arose and came out of
[2:36:00] the grave after his resurrection and
[2:36:03] went into the holy city and appeared to
[2:36:08] mithi this is what happened in that
[2:36:12] resurrection a word appeared e is a word
[2:36:17] in Ponzo which means that showed oneself
[2:36:24] come to view it was seen a beard by too
[2:36:30] many
[2:36:32] came out of the grace
[2:36:35] [Music]
[2:36:38] let me read you a little quotation from
[2:36:40] the sixth seal
[2:36:44] we should have visualized now it's the
[2:36:47] last night it's the last watch of the
[2:36:50] night we eating the Passover staff is in
[2:36:56] our hand
[2:36:59] we're prepared to leave as soon as the
[2:37:03] trumpet sounds
[2:37:08] the sixth seal God let the people be
[2:37:12] quickly awakened Lord
[2:37:17] those who have their names on the book
[2:37:19] of life when this light when this
[2:37:21] flashes across her path they they see
[2:37:24] like the little in fairly old faint
[2:37:26] woman at the well that day she
[2:37:28] recognized quickly and she knew the
[2:37:30] scripture and our Father I pray that you
[2:37:35] receive that all will receive you at
[2:37:37] this time in the hearts and will settle
[2:37:40] it forever in the South that their
[2:37:42] finish was sin that arise and made
[2:37:45] preparations now for public confession
[2:37:48] of the baptism in the name of Jesus
[2:37:50] Christ for the remission of sin to show
[2:37:54] they believe God has forgiven them and
[2:37:55] they take on the name of Jesus Christ
[2:37:57] and father poured down the holy oil
[2:38:00] spirit of Holy Spirit of oil upon them
[2:38:04] that they may be placed into the service
[2:38:06] of the service of the Lord that there
[2:38:09] may be workers in this last day but we
[2:38:11] realize that we have just a short time
[2:38:14] and the church might go at any time
[2:38:17] the lab might at any time leave the
[2:38:20] sanctuary up there in the throne of
[2:38:21] sacrifice come forward from the throne
[2:38:24] of God with his sacrifice Laden and it's
[2:38:26] over there's no more hopes of the world
[2:38:28] she's finished then she goes into
[2:38:32] frustrations of great spasms of
[2:38:35] earthquakes and great shakings like was
[2:38:38] at the resurrection like I just read
[2:38:41] about and as Christ rose from the grave
[2:38:44] when the saints rise the same thing will
[2:38:49] take place lord
[2:38:52] it could be at any minute we're watching
[2:38:59] for that glad day to arrive take your
[2:39:02] children under your arms father now draw
[2:39:06] your little lambs to your bosom granite
[2:39:11] and feed them on the word till they're
[2:39:14] in strength for service I want you to
[2:39:20] think of this the sounding of the
[2:39:24] trumpet but Jesus Rose the dead in
[2:39:29] Christ roots with him appeared to me the
[2:39:33] Bible said it was a great earth brother
[2:39:35] Brent said the same thing will happen
[2:39:38] again
[2:39:41] you realize we've been waiting on when
[2:39:44] prophesy I mean this man this man's
[2:39:47] prophesied accurate time on time and
[2:39:50] time again over and over nope never
[2:39:56] failed one time stood there in 1965
[2:40:01] shoes another bride said there's a bride
[2:40:04] being chosen you gotta have the
[2:40:08] characteristics of Christ he's coming
[2:40:10] for a virgin somebody to recruit
[2:40:16] then he spoke about Los Angeles how long
[2:40:21] you'll that's your hangover like a sand
[2:40:25] bar it's just quaking beneath you now
[2:40:28] the works had been done in Sodom and
[2:40:31] doesn't you you you know their Sodom
[2:40:34] would have repented but you would not
[2:40:36] you don't know what hour you'd be laying
[2:40:38] at the bottom of the sea and right now
[2:40:41] we're just looking they're calling it
[2:40:44] they're calling it the swarms of
[2:40:47] earthquakes
[2:40:49] it's trembling everywhere just hit over
[2:40:52] again in the Mojave devlin desert of
[2:40:54] seven point something the earthquake
[2:40:56] they said the big one hadn't hit we
[2:40:59] don't know what's gonna happen when it
[2:41:00] does but I'll tell you what we know this
[2:41:06] the dead in Christ gonna rise
[2:41:09] this parallels exactly that coming and
[2:41:14] there's an earthquake about to hit the
[2:41:18] world will go into nervous frustrations
[2:41:21] six seal will open with every kind of
[2:41:23] judgment can imagine every seat will be
[2:41:27] cast out of heaven as the bride goes up
[2:41:30] you don't have a short time of darkness
[2:41:32] upon the earth before the Millennium day
[2:41:35] dawns that's when Jesus coming back to
[2:41:44] have you come in the Passover are you
[2:41:47] really in that fellowship I want you to
[2:41:51] think about it God made a desperate soul

[2:42:01] you can't go in Oh mum and dad's
[2:42:03] experience somebody else's you got to

[2:42:25] I'm asking where are you having Christ
[2:42:28] you make your call and election sure

[2:42:42] he said Lord my children are coming
[2:42:45] they'll wake up any moment so just let
[2:42:49] me find the place in the scripture and
[2:42:52] it opened right there the first
[2:42:55] Corinthians that I read
[2:42:57] purge out that old eleven crisis our
[2:43:01] past so far you've got to have that

[2:43:09] realize that even some old timers are
[2:43:11] letting the blood get off the door I'm
[2:43:12] asking you in a time for a fresh
[2:43:14] application of it at that time for a
[2:43:17] renewing of the Holy Ghost in your own
[2:43:19] life won't you ask him to do it would
[2:43:23] you draw nigh to God you know nothing

[2:43:29] can't play with it they're famous
[2:43:32] laughter you you may just be one step
[2:43:34] ahead but he'll get you but he can be
[2:43:39] bound
[2:43:42] there's got to be a church alive and
[2:43:45] remain that can bind that Death Angel
[2:43:49] that can say all God have mercy on my
[2:43:52] brother no they've been given the power
[2:43:55] to buy
[2:43:57] are you ready to walk into that
[2:43:59] sincerity I'm asking this church over
