[43:30] we have been called and chosen for this
[43:31] last day Lord many people would look and
[43:34] talk about how evil it is and things of
[43:36] that nature and yet Lord what we've been

[44:19] service into into your hands now Lord in
[44:22] Jesus name we pray amen amen wonderful
[44:26] to be in the house of God wonderful to
[44:28] be feeling well
[44:30] amen if you if you have your Bibles with
[44:32] me with you tonight if you turn with me
[44:34] over to the book of Jude again the first
[44:36] chapter
[44:37] and as you're turning there
[44:40] just in preparation for this service
[44:42] with my mind heavily leaning towards the
[44:45] youth and and their trip uh coming up
[44:48] this week and recognizing the importance
[44:51] and the opportunity of these kind of
[44:54] meetings and the things that uh that
[44:56] that they're about to be in and I would
[44:58] ask that each one of you be in fervent
[45:01] prayer for the meetings and for our
[45:02] youth and for our children but not only
[45:04] for them but the Youth of this message
[45:06] as they would gather together and there
[45:09] are many that are going to actually have
[45:10] the opportunity to come face to face
[45:12] with the Lord Jesus
[45:14] many are going to have the opportunity
[45:16] at life many are going to have the
[45:18] opportunity at Deliverance men are going
[45:20] to have the opportunity at healings and
[45:22] at the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[45:24] look we don't load up and go on these
[45:26] trips just for a good time
[45:28] all right although we're going to have a
[45:30] good time you know I believe that
[45:32] um but but I'm not getting on a bus with
[45:34] 52 I mean I just quit teaching to get
[45:36] away from these situations I'm not
[45:38] getting on a bus with 50 young people to
[45:40] travel 14 hours for a good time I'm
[45:43] going because I believe that there's
[45:44] going to be things of Eternal value take
[45:46] place there's going to be lives touched
[45:48] there's going to be people delivered and
[45:49] we're just asking that you'll be in
[45:51] prayer for that and and and not only
[45:54] that not only do we want them to have
[45:57] those kind of services there and the
[45:59] young people but we want them for
[46:00] everybody and we want them here and we
[46:02] want them when we come together not to
[46:03] waste an opportunity but we should
[46:06] Endeavor every time we come together to
[46:08] create that atmosphere where lives can
[46:09] be changed and young people I would even
[46:12] ask you I know in a few hours or an hour
[46:14] I know you're thinking a few hours whoa
[46:16] slow down
[46:17] um here in a minute you're wanting to
[46:19] load up on the bus and uh and head to
[46:22] Ohio but just for a few moments let's
[46:24] gather in right here you know don't put
[46:26] off until Thursday night or Friday
[46:27] Friday night an opportunity that you can
[46:29] have right here tonight to be delivered
[46:32] and be set free so as we look to the
[46:34] word tonight the book of Jude third uh
[46:36] third chapter third verse excuse me it
[46:39] says beloved when I gave all diligence
[46:41] to write unto you of the common
[46:42] salvation it was needful for me to write
[46:45] unto you and exhort that you should
[46:48] earnestly contend for the faith which
[46:52] was once delivered unto the Saints and
[46:55] also we want to look in Psalm 60 and
[46:57] verse 4 and as you're turning there I
[47:00] believe what we just read about
[47:01] contending to the faith is is pertinent
[47:03] for everyone here but as time would go
[47:06] on it's going to be even more and more
[47:07] pertinent for you young people because
[47:09] as time goes on you're going to see
[47:11] further and further adrift further and
[47:13] further standards being let down and
[47:15] landmarks being overrun and you're gonna
[47:17] have to contend harder and harder every
[47:20] single day Psalm 60 and verse 4 it says
[47:23] thou has given a banner to them that
[47:27] fear thee that it may be displayed
[47:30] because of the truth Selah amen you may
[47:34] have your seats tonight we just ask that
[47:36] the Lord without his blessings to the
[47:37] word brother Brandon would say God grant
[47:40] it tonight
[47:41] everything has went by May that still
[47:44] Small Voice attract the people tonight
[47:46] to a real Sanctified life a life that'll
[47:49] stand by their God that will stand by
[47:52] their church that will stand by their
[47:55] Pastor that'll stand by the cause of
[47:57] Christ that'll hold up a banner that'll
[48:00] live act dress go and Associate and live
[48:04] in the environment that'll be so salty
[48:07] that it will cause others to thirst to
[48:10] be like them
[48:12] I believe that's the desire for each and
[48:13] every one of us but as I said tonight as
[48:16] I prepared and looked and thought my
[48:17] heart was with the youth but don't just
[48:19] let them let this be to them tonight
[48:21] take it take it for yourself as we're
[48:23] going to minister for a bit on
[48:25] proclaiming the standard or raising the
[48:29] standard we're gonna we're gonna preach
[48:30] tonight on raising the standard and the
[48:33] last time we ministered we were talking
[48:35] about defending the landmarks uh
[48:37] defending the faith as it was once
[48:39] delivered unto the Saints and and to
[48:41] tonight I want to kind of head down that
[48:43] same road that same line of Defending
[48:46] truth of of standing on the Liberty that
[48:49] we have in Christ Jesus and and and
[48:52] defending the land that we as a people
[48:54] that you as a young people has been
[48:56] returned back to in this day and not
[48:59] only to to defend what you currently
[49:02] have and not be satisfied with defending
[49:04] this little portion but being willing to
[49:07] take further steps and to obtain all
[49:09] that God has promised to give you all
[49:11] right because within the landmarks and
[49:14] within the boundaries you are to take
[49:16] everything that God has promised and
[49:18] that God has said that you can have so
[49:20] as we get ready to go to meetings as we
[49:22] sit down for a church service don't just
[49:24] let it be a time where you come together
[49:26] just to worship or just to hear
[49:28] something good but in this moment in
[49:31] this service in this weekend of meetings
[49:33] I'm gonna take more I'm gonna grow a
[49:35] little bit I'm going to take more of the
[49:37] Holy Ghost I'm going to take another
[49:38] step I'm going to overcome that which
[49:41] has been hindering me every time we come
[49:43] together it's not just for a good time
[49:45] what we have to start to recognize is
[49:47] Every Time We Gather it is for war it is
[49:50] for battle it is to drive off the enemy
[49:53] it is to take more of our possessions
[49:55] and he's not just going to give it to
[49:56] you you got to be willing to show up
[49:58] wake up get into the battle draw your
[50:00] sword and fight you understand come on I
[50:03] want you to get with me tonight you can
[50:05] relax and hopefully sleep on the bus
[50:07] later but right now this is about you
[50:09] this is about you raising the standard
[50:11] this is about you come into your
[50:12] position this is about you overcoming
[50:15] tonight amen it's time that we get ready
[50:17] to go to battle and I was thinking about
[50:20] our church and our youth and each and
[50:22] every one of us and the obligation that
[50:24] we have to fight
[50:27] the obligation that we have to defend
[50:30] what God has done in this day
[50:32] generationally speaking to defend that
[50:35] there is a message sent but not even not
[50:38] not so much even just generate
[50:39] generationally speaking but individually
[50:42] speaking you have to defend what it is
[50:45] God has done for you you have to defend
[50:48] your possessions you have to defend your
[50:50] experience you have to defend your home
[50:53] we have to defend personally what it is
[50:56] God has done and not allow the devil to
[50:58] come in and steal for there's a lot of
[51:00] people that'll defend God sent a prophet
[51:02] there's a lot of people that'll defend
[51:04] God sent a message there's a lot of
[51:06] people and yet they won't defend their
[51:07] own homes they won't defend their own
[51:09] Joy their own peace they're living in
[51:11] defeat they got no Victory they'll tell
[51:13] you oh God sent a prophet there's a
[51:15] message isn't it good but they got no
[51:16] victory in their home you got to defend
[51:18] your experience you've got to defend
[51:20] your land you can't just sit there
[51:22] service after service and well God's
[51:24] good God's good while you're being
[51:26] robbed day after day after that you've
[51:28] got to defend the land you got to defend
[51:30] the landmarks you've got to raise up and
[51:32] be willing to fight for what God has
[51:34] given you in this day
[51:38] we got to rebuild the walls around our
[51:40] families
[51:42] push our way back to the landmarks
[51:44] that are there in the word and recognize
[51:46] that those are for us
[51:48] and then using that word we must begin
[51:50] to rebuild the places that we've allowed
[51:52] the walls to be torn down
[51:54] we have to begin to rebuild the places
[51:56] in our in our lives and we all have them
[51:58] that maybe are weaker than other parts
[52:00] of our lives
[52:02] rebuild the parts in our lives that
[52:03] maybe we've neglected
[52:05] parts that we've allowed to go
[52:06] unattended to
[52:08] we have to take the time to nurture our
[52:10] experience into a true relationship
[52:13] because if your experience is just a
[52:15] one-time thing that happened at an altar
[52:17] in a church service that's not a
[52:18] relationship
[52:20] that was just an encounter
[52:22] and there's lots of people in the Bible
[52:24] that had encounters with Jesus and went
[52:26] to hell you can encounter Jesus but if
[52:29] you don't do something with that
[52:31] encounter if you don't go deeper than
[52:33] that encounter if you don't let it grow
[52:34] into a relationship what good has it
[52:36] actually done you
[52:38] so rebuild the walls and and go into a
[52:41] relationship with him we've heard it
[52:43] time and time again that our our
[52:45] relationships or our experiences with
[52:46] God are not to be a one and done thing
[52:50] it is a walk it is a progression to
[52:53] where we walk with him daily where we go
[52:55] from experience to experience to
[52:58] experience ever growing Ever Changing
[53:01] ever maturing ever getting stronger
[53:03] always Allowing God to mold us into his
[53:06] image
[53:07] continually putting one stone upon
[53:10] another Stone building up this part of
[53:12] the wall and building up this part of
[53:14] the wall is something we have to be
[53:15] doing strengthening me God in this area
[53:17] strengthen my life in this place never
[53:20] ever ever allowing yourself to get
[53:22] comfortable and feel like oh I've
[53:24] arrived
[53:25] you know some people get to that place
[53:27] to where you know they recognize that
[53:29] that there is to be a five-fold Ministry
[53:31] and they recognize that there's going to
[53:33] be Evangelistic preaching but that's
[53:35] really not for me I'm beyond that
[53:38] oh I don't get excited about the
[53:39] Evangelist I need the deeper stuff
[53:41] according to that comment you're the one
[53:43] who needs the Evangelistic stuff the
[53:45] most
[53:46] we never get to a point where the
[53:49] ministry of God isn't doesn't have an
[53:51] impact on our life there's always a
[53:53] place of repentance I Die daily there's
[53:56] always a place of I need more I need to
[53:58] cut down more of myself there's always
[54:00] an opportunity for God to stand on us a
[54:02] little bit to mold us a little bit to
[54:04] shape us a little bit continually
[54:07] allowing this
[54:09] not saying oh I'm there I'm good I'm
[54:11] comfortable but praying Lord shake me
[54:13] again tonight Lord shake me again
[54:16] tonight where am I lacking tonight Lord
[54:19] where can I grow tonight Lord do
[54:21] something for me in this service Lord
[54:24] brother Brown says God we we're not so
[54:28] anxious tonight to see the building
[54:30] shook
[54:31] but we would like for you to shake us
[54:34] Lord Shake our understanding Shake our
[54:37] being Shake our emotions our hearts of
[54:41] understanding that we might leave here
[54:42] tonight more determined than ever to
[54:44] serve you that we might feel the
[54:46] presence of a new Fresh Pentecost of a
[54:50] holy spirit pouring out upon us a fresh
[54:52] and Anew like down in those woods and
[54:55] hills in Arkansas 50 years ago when the
[54:57] forefathers come through here in the
[54:59] horses and wagons preaching the gospel
[55:01] dear Lord may we the bearers of this
[55:04] great worthy cause that you sent through
[55:05] here may we not be ashamed of this great
[55:08] thing but may we walk in the footsteps
[55:10] of those who went before us Lord packing
[55:13] the banner of Lord Jesus Christ there's
[55:15] a banner young people that we're
[55:17] carrying there's a standard that's being
[55:19] lifted up before the people
[55:21] we have to come to the place
[55:23] as Christians to where we are solid
[55:27] to where we're solid in our faith and
[55:29] yet we're still seeking
[55:32] many times they feel like that those
[55:33] that are seeking and those that are at
[55:35] the altar and those oh they must not be
[55:37] very strong no they've actually kind of
[55:39] got it figured out
[55:40] you're supposed to be solid and you're
[55:42] supposed to be strong and yet seeking
[55:44] for more Lord where can I Repent where
[55:46] can more of you come into me pour
[55:48] yourself out of me a little bit more I'm
[55:50] strong Lord but I'm seeking for more
[55:53] we have to be strong examples and yet
[55:57] teachable
[56:00] solid and seeking strong examples and
[56:04] yet teachable
[56:06] leaders and yet willing to be changed
[56:12] listen those two things are not
[56:13] exclusive
[56:15] that I'm a solid Christian and yet I
[56:17] need more of God
[56:19] you can be a Godly overcoming Christian
[56:23] and need more from God
[56:26] as a matter of fact that better be where
[56:28] you're at tonight
[56:30] Lord I'm in the battle Lord I'm
[56:32] overcoming Lord I'm walking in Victory
[56:34] and yet I'm very aware tonight Lord I
[56:37] need more of you I need another touch
[56:39] from you I need more of your Holy Ghost
[56:41] tonight Lord yes I'm in the battle yes
[56:43] I'm fighting yes I'm overcoming but I
[56:46] need more of God
[56:51] but see this is the place where the
[56:53] devil gets so many people
[56:56] he'll take somebody with a burning
[56:57] desire for more of the Holy Ghost
[57:00] and turning against them
[57:02] to where they're afraid to come and seek
[57:04] more of the Holy Ghost that's where
[57:06] they're afraid to come and seek more
[57:07] because what are they going to think if
[57:08] they're if you're back at the altar
[57:09] again
[57:11] listen if you ever get to the point to
[57:12] where your desire for the Holy Ghost is
[57:14] quenched you are deceived
[57:18] because if you're not wanting more if
[57:21] you're not wanting another touch if
[57:22] you're not wanting another outpouring I
[57:23] doubt you ever had the first one
[57:27] we got to be to a place where we're
[57:29] continually God I gotta have more God I
[57:31] need more of you pour yourself back out
[57:33] on me again but the Devil comes and he
[57:36] attacks you there and he points to your
[57:37] weakness and he points to your failures
[57:39] and he accuses you day and night
[57:42] and he accused oh yeah oh yeah you're
[57:44] seeking more because you didn't get
[57:46] nothing oh yeah that's why you're so
[57:47] sorry you know you didn't get nothing
[57:48] from but no no you listen that's not the
[57:50] time to back up that's not the time to
[57:52] listen that's not the time to agree to
[57:54] when he starts pointing all that let me
[57:55] tell you what I point him to I point him
[57:57] to my victories I point into what God's
[57:59] done for me I pointed to a life of what
[58:01] used to be and where I'm at now I point
[58:03] into a life where my desires have
[58:05] changed where my Natures have changed
[58:07] yes I mean more of God yes I need more
[58:09] every day but look what he's already
[58:11] done for me look how much he's changed
[58:13] me look where he's brought me from look
[58:15] where I'm at I'm redeemed I'm blood I'm
[58:18] Blood Washed look at that demo pointing
[58:21] back to the victories pointing back to
[58:24] your experiences
[58:26] pointing back to Calvary
[58:29] that's where we laid it all down
[58:35] that doesn't mean I don't got more to do
[58:40] that doesn't mean the Lord isn't still
[58:42] working on me
[58:47] I know I got walls to build up in my
[58:49] life
[58:50] I know I got areas I need to improve in
[58:53] I know I got places I need to mature
[58:56] hopefully we are all at a place where we
[58:59] can recognize that about ourselves
[59:04] that's where I want you at tonight young
[59:06] people
[59:07] that's where I want you at tonight
[59:08] recognizing your need for more of God
[59:11] but praising him for what he's done for
[59:13] you

[1:06:50] our chief Captain you know many times
[1:06:52] you're there
[1:06:53] and in late in the fight if the trainer
[1:06:55] feels like you got a chance to win but
[1:06:57] the fighter you're facing is better than
[1:06:59] you they'll tell you hey there's just

[1:07:13] tonight our captain ain't saying that
[1:07:15] tonight he's saying not only have you
[1:07:16] whooped him in every round not only are
[1:07:18] you still standing take the fight to him
[1:07:20] take the battle to him he's about to go

[1:07:28] the enemy these are the championship
[1:07:31] rounds we're still standing
[1:07:35] Hallelujah
[1:07:42] our God is in our corner
[1:07:46] he says take the fight to him
[1:07:48] take the battle to him
[1:07:51] finish the fight
[1:07:54] he thought so much of you
[1:07:57] and so much of you
[1:07:58] that he made you a standard Bearer
[1:08:01] in the final charge
[1:08:03] of the final battle
[1:08:04] that will ever be fought
[1:08:09] someone who would carry the standard
[1:08:11] someone in the last day that God could
[1:08:14] trust to see this thing through
[1:08:16] someone who would lift up the word of
[1:08:18] God in a world of evil
[1:08:21] he chose you
[1:08:23] brother Brown says but in every
[1:08:24] generation God has always had his agents
[1:08:27] it's got down sometimes to merely one
[1:08:30] but God always had somebody in every
[1:08:32] generation that he could lay his fingers
[1:08:35] on people that he could put his finger
[1:08:37] on and say this is my people and they
[1:08:40] will do as I tell them to do oh I love
[1:08:44] that
[1:08:46] of all the people he could have chose
[1:08:48] think about that God said I need a young
[1:08:51] people
[1:08:52] I need a group of people who won't bow
[1:08:54] down to the pressure of the age
[1:08:57] I need believers who will protect the
[1:09:00] truths in this word
[1:09:02] I need somebody in the worst condition
[1:09:04] that's ever been that will be willing to
[1:09:06] stand and fight when it seems like
[1:09:07] they're completely surrounded
[1:09:11] when it seems there's no hope when
[1:09:12] others are caved into the pressure when
[1:09:14] others are walking away from the message
[1:09:16] who's he going to be
[1:09:19] who's he gonna pick in his great
[1:09:21] Infinite Wisdom down through the ages in
[1:09:23] his eternal mind knowing all things
[1:09:25] knowing the people he could choose from
[1:09:27] no one who could stand no one who could
[1:09:29] take it who are my very best
[1:09:35] and we're talking about like the Navy
[1:09:36] Seals of the ages
[1:09:39] the Eternal Army Rangers
[1:09:42] the very best of the best who can I
[1:09:45] trust to carry the standard into the
[1:09:48] very teeth of the darkness
[1:09:56] me I'm just a
[1:09:58] you're gonna argue with God
[1:10:02] so many times God's sitting there trying
[1:10:04] to bless us trying to give us the Holy
[1:10:05] Ghost trying to give us more and we're
[1:10:06] arguing with him
[1:10:08] I'm just not worthy he made you Worthy
[1:10:11] none of us were worthy he made you
[1:10:14] worthy he chose you he predestinated you
[1:10:17] he placed you here because he knew you
[1:10:19] would get the job done
[1:10:21] he knew you would raise the standard he
[1:10:24] knew you would lift up the banner
[1:10:26] he knew you would stand in the age of
[1:10:28] Darkness
[1:10:30] look sure there's people falling away
[1:10:34] there's people letting down standards
[1:10:37] there's people that are allowing ancient
[1:10:39] landmarks to be overrun
[1:10:42] to be taken by the enemy
[1:10:44] let's don't get our eyes on that we're
[1:10:46] talking about you we're talking about
[1:10:48] where you're standing
[1:10:50] people sit too long with breeches in
[1:10:52] their wall and in so doing the gaps in
[1:10:55] the walls have allowed it's not this it
[1:10:58] doesn't allow the evil to come in and
[1:11:00] then the standards go out
[1:11:03] because the evil can't get in as long as
[1:11:05] the standards are there
[1:11:07] what happens is the standards get let
[1:11:09] down
[1:11:10] the standards flow out and then the evil
[1:11:14] Flows In
[1:11:16] right it's not vice versa but they you
[1:11:19] allow you sit in a place long enough to
[1:11:21] where you don't repair the walls and you
[1:11:24] don't raise the standards and now broken
[1:11:26] down walls as we said that they're not
[1:11:28] only allow the the standards out but
[1:11:29] they allow the enemy to come in
[1:11:35] and Through the Ages the wall has been
[1:11:37] torn down and God began to restore and
[1:11:40] he sent the messages in each age until
[1:11:42] this day it was perfect complete
[1:11:45] but what happens over time is people
[1:11:47] Begin to Fall Away
[1:11:49] people begin to neglect it's not the
[1:11:51] problem of the message
[1:11:54] people allow these areas people begin to
[1:11:56] teach Doctrine drawing people hold the
[1:11:59] things that aren't true
[1:12:00] and in so doing the landmarks move
[1:12:04] and God's calling the people to rebuild
[1:12:06] the wall
[1:12:07] to raise the standard to go fill in the
[1:12:09] gaps oh well not me I'm just a young
[1:12:11] person I can't do those things
[1:12:14] Nehemiah 3 28
[1:12:16] from above the horse gate repaired the
[1:12:18] priest every one over against his house
[1:12:21] and after them repaired Zara the son of
[1:12:24] emmer over against his house and after
[1:12:27] him repaired also shamaya the son of
[1:12:30] shekiniah and The Keeper of the East
[1:12:32] Gate and then verse 30 and after him
[1:12:35] repaired hananiah the son of shalimia
[1:12:38] and Hanan the sixth son
[1:12:41] of zelath
[1:12:43] another piece after him repaired
[1:12:46] meshalum the son of barakaya over
[1:12:49] against the chamber right here in this
[1:12:51] verse
[1:12:52] the commentators will note that in all
[1:12:54] these others it says the son of the son
[1:12:57] of the son of and it gets to Hanan
[1:13:00] and it says the sixth son of
[1:13:03] it's the only one who it does like this
[1:13:05] and what they note is that this is his
[1:13:07] youngest child
[1:13:09] this is the young person in the house
[1:13:11] and it didn't matter to him that the
[1:13:15] five older brothers didn't want to
[1:13:16] repair it
[1:13:17] it didn't matter to him that his five
[1:13:19] older brothers didn't put their hands to
[1:13:21] the work it didn't matter to him that
[1:13:23] the five older brothers were okay with
[1:13:25] cold formal worship it didn't matter to
[1:13:27] him that the five other kids in the
[1:13:30] family were okay letting down the
[1:13:31] standards of modesty it didn't matter to
[1:13:34] him that they felt like they could just
[1:13:35] join a church and believe the message
[1:13:37] and they were going to be saved he may
[1:13:39] have been the youngest one in the family
[1:13:40] and he said but I got a part to play
[1:13:42] there's a standard to hold up you must
[1:13:44] be born again there is a standard of
[1:13:46] modesty there is a standard of Holiness
[1:13:48] there is a standard of conduct there's
[1:13:50] something we believe in and the older
[1:13:52] ones they may not put their hand to it
[1:13:54] they may not worship they may not build
[1:13:56] they may not be interested but I'll do
[1:13:59] it I'll stand up and do it I'll play the
[1:14:01] part I'll rebuild the wall I'm not
[1:14:04] worried that I'm younger there's a part
[1:14:05] I can play and something I can do I'll
[1:14:08] build the wall I'll raise the standard
[1:14:16] foreign
[1:14:17] it doesn't matter
[1:14:19] what this one says I'll uphold the
[1:14:22] standards
[1:14:24] it doesn't matter where this church
[1:14:25] leans or what that church teaches listen
[1:14:28] the standard is the word
[1:14:34] the standard is the word and I'll fight
[1:14:36] to uphold that standard older ones don't
[1:14:39] want to do it fine
[1:14:41] they won't put their hands to the work
[1:14:42] fine they don't want to create the
[1:14:44] atmosphere in the service so that people
[1:14:46] can be born again delivered set free
[1:14:48] fine our youth will do it they'll
[1:14:51] worship they'll stand they'll Rejoice
[1:14:53] they'll give their all they'll go to war
[1:14:55] they're not ashamed they're not afraid
[1:14:57] they ain't got to the point yet where
[1:14:59] they think they've got it all figured
[1:15:00] out they recognize I need you God come
[1:15:04] in this service come in this moment blow
[1:15:07] yourself out in my life
[1:15:10] they'll do it
[1:15:15] let no man despise your youth
[1:15:27] one commentator said
[1:15:29] that's the younger brother if he'd be
[1:15:32] the better man
[1:15:33] and does God and His generation better
[1:15:35] service he is indeed the better
[1:15:38] gentleman
[1:15:39] those that are most honorable
[1:15:42] are those that are most useful
[1:15:46] you can do what you want with that
[1:15:49] hey the older ones wouldn't go kill
[1:15:51] Goliath
[1:15:54] fine get out the way please
[1:16:00] listen
[1:16:02] we got a church full of really wonderful
[1:16:04] middle-aging older people
[1:16:06] so if this don't apply to you don't take
[1:16:07] the medicine
[1:16:09] all the medicine in the cabinet ain't
[1:16:10] supposed to be for you to take
[1:16:13] but if it does apply to you dose on up
[1:16:19] get you some it'll do you good
[1:16:24] there's a generation that's been called
[1:16:26] to be the final
[1:16:28] standard bearers
[1:16:30] and they will stand
[1:16:32] and they are standing
[1:16:34] in the face of everything that the enemy
[1:16:36] can throw at them
[1:16:37] and their cry is we will not let down
[1:16:40] the standard
[1:16:42] brother Brown says no wonder
[1:16:43] Christianity can't even lift up a
[1:16:45] standard it's because it's not because
[1:16:47] Christ is not able but because the
[1:16:49] people won't do it
[1:16:51] said the message is ready the power of
[1:16:53] God is sufficient men and women are
[1:16:55] scared to break out yonder into the
[1:16:56] spirit spheres before God and dare to
[1:16:58] trust him and take him out his word
[1:17:01] he says so Faith isn't built upon the
[1:17:03] shifting Sands of emotional Concepts but
[1:17:06] faith is built upon the standard God's
[1:17:08] Eternal Word the Rock of Ages that's
[1:17:11] where Faith takes its solemn resting
[1:17:13] place and it never moves when it's built
[1:17:15] right there
[1:17:17] a people called to raise the standard of
[1:17:21] the word we talked about it last time
[1:17:23] how we can't dare to give an inch you
[1:17:26] can't give up even a little bit
[1:17:28] we can't let down the bars oh listen we
[1:17:31] can't be willy-nilly and wishy-washy
[1:17:33] about things and expect overcoming lives
[1:17:36] we can't let down standards in our home
[1:17:38] and expect overcoming children
[1:17:40] the world that we live in presents a
[1:17:42] very very dangerous I'll say all for
[1:17:48] or uh
[1:17:50] what's the word I want it has escaped me
[1:17:54] but a way for us to negotiate as it were
[1:18:00] just give up a little bit and we'll back
[1:18:02] off
[1:18:03] just give up a little bit
[1:18:06] just compromise a little just why can't
[1:18:09] you be willing to say things a little
[1:18:11] softer
[1:18:13] why you gotta be so harsh
[1:18:16] just be willing to baby things a little
[1:18:18] bit for the sake that we can all just
[1:18:20] get along
[1:18:22] when in reality that's never the end
[1:18:24] game of the enemy
[1:18:27] that's not what he wants he doesn't want
[1:18:30] that inch he doesn't want that peace
[1:18:32] once you move a little bit listen to me
[1:18:34] young people we've seen it Time After
[1:18:35] Time After Time you give a little bit
[1:18:37] and it is a bottomless pit Straight to
[1:18:39] Hell
[1:18:40] many times there's no turning around
[1:18:42] next thing you know it's not just a
[1:18:43] standard here and a standard there next
[1:18:45] thing you know you're in a life of Filth
[1:18:46] you're in a life where you don't even
[1:18:47] believe God exists all because you gave
[1:18:50] a little bit don't let him fool you into
[1:18:53] thinking he wants just a little bit you
[1:18:55] compromise a little and you're going to
[1:18:57] be overrun you compromise even a little
[1:18:59] and you're going to be overtaken look
[1:19:01] that's why I'm thankful for a ministry
[1:19:03] here that'll tell it like it is that'll
[1:19:05] stand on truth that ain't worried about
[1:19:07] your feelings that's willing to offend
[1:19:10] in order to stay true to the word as
[1:19:12] I've heard it said before the truth
[1:19:14] don't care about your feelings
[1:19:20] it's okay I'm leaving here in a minute
[1:19:21] anyway
[1:19:28] you can't give an inch listen all this
[1:19:31] lgbq RSVP stuff that's running all over
[1:19:35] our nation and trying to overtake and
[1:19:37] down throw every standard that we've
[1:19:38] ever had in this world in this in this
[1:19:40] nation running and says listen 1996 Bill
[1:19:43] Clinton the liberal of all liberals
[1:19:46] signed the marriage protection act
[1:19:49] this is where the Liberals were in 1996
[1:19:51] when I was 16.
[1:19:53] marriage protection act that declared
[1:19:56] marriage was between a man and a woman
[1:19:59] that's where the Liberals were
[1:20:03] you you think it don't go quit Bill
[1:20:05] Clinton outlawed gay marriage
[1:20:09] or upheld the fact that it was outlawed
[1:20:11] however you want to look at it
[1:20:13] the marriage protection act
[1:20:17] and for years they cried oh we just want
[1:20:20] to be treated this we just want the
[1:20:22] right demand
[1:20:27] we just want the right to marry
[1:20:30] why all the hate
[1:20:32] we don't want to interfere with the way
[1:20:34] you live you're like we just want to
[1:20:35] live our life what a lie that turned out
[1:20:37] to be
[1:20:40] what oh love love love the liberal
[1:20:44] rallying cry love
[1:20:48] wow that we just want to get married
[1:20:52] we just love each other
[1:20:54] we want to be married like everyone else
[1:20:56] you won't even hear from us
[1:20:59] skip a little
[1:21:03] but from well not this Pulpit because we
[1:21:05] wasn't here but in the other Pulpit at
[1:21:08] evening like Tabernacle I can
[1:21:09] specifically remember brother Tim
[1:21:11] preaching they don't just want to get
[1:21:13] married he said this is the attack point
[1:21:15] they want to move the standard and make
[1:21:18] a mockery of anything that is an
[1:21:19] institution of God
[1:21:23] it was just their point of attack it was
[1:21:26] just where they wanted to get started so
[1:21:28] in 2015 the Supreme Court overruled the
[1:21:30] marriage protection act giving them to
[1:21:32] write the right to marry and from that
[1:21:34] time it has been a flood
[1:21:37] an absolute unraveling of the standards
[1:21:40] of society that once was one nation
[1:21:42] under God
[1:21:46] how far how far that will they take how
[1:21:48] far will my life spiral out of control I
[1:21:50] just want to do some small things
[1:21:52] I just want to be normal
[1:21:54] if they did too they wanted to get
[1:21:55] married and be normal
[1:22:01] how far has it gone until now there is a
[1:22:03] movement
[1:22:04] you don't believe and if you want to get
[1:22:06] sick to your stomach look it up but
[1:22:08] there is a movement
[1:22:09] to no longer use the term pedophile to
[1:22:13] describe those who want sexual activity
[1:22:14] with children
[1:22:15] because it gives them too awful of a
[1:22:18] stigma
[1:22:19] it creates a bad reputation for them we
[1:22:21] are now to know them as map or minor
[1:22:25] attracted persons
[1:22:27] foreign
[1:22:29] very common Topic in the news these days
[1:22:31] if you don't believe me
[1:22:33] minor attracted persons we're not
[1:22:34] supposed to you can't be mean to them
[1:22:36] just because they want to be with your
[1:22:37] children
[1:22:40] I'm sorry that's disgusting I know it's
[1:22:41] a bottomless pit
[1:22:44] you can't give an inch you can't back up
[1:22:48] any you gotta hold the standard of Truth
[1:22:50] you got to raise it up high for the
[1:22:52] whole world to see you've got to let
[1:22:54] them know I'm not neutral this ain't
[1:22:55] Switzerland I'm not neutral I'm taking a
[1:22:57] stand I'm going to stand right here on
[1:23:00] the ancient landmarks I don't care how
[1:23:02] long you say gay people can get married
[1:23:03] I don't care how long you say those
[1:23:05] things are normal that's not the
[1:23:06] landmark that's not what God instituted
[1:23:08] I'm gonna stand on God's word I'm going
[1:23:10] to raise the banner I'm going to hold
[1:23:12] the scanner you can be mad you can be
[1:23:14] angry you can hate me that's fine but
[1:23:17] I'm Gonna Stand and raise a standard and
[1:23:19] say this is what God called me to be
[1:23:21] this is eternal truth this is the word
[1:23:25] of God and it's what I'll live by it's
[1:23:27] what I'll die by if I do that's what's
[1:23:29] going to raise me so I'm gonna stand
[1:23:31] right on it
[1:23:34] you gotta hold up the standard
[1:23:39] it disgusts me I'm sorry we've all been
[1:23:42] there when you ain't 100 sold out to God
[1:23:45] you get attracted by worldly things you
[1:23:48] get attracted by this star and this
[1:23:50] movie and these things and it becomes
[1:23:52] something that you want to match up to
[1:23:53] or something that you want to be like
[1:23:55] brother Brown said I don't care if my
[1:23:57] pants match my code or my tie matches
[1:23:59] everything just let my experience match
[1:24:02] this word right here let my experience
[1:24:05] match this word right here let this be
[1:24:07] what I match up to this is what we need
[1:24:10] to emulate this is what we gotta match
[1:24:12] this is the experience we gotta have
[1:24:16] hold the standard let it manifest in you
[1:24:19] until the word becomes flesh and you are
[1:24:21] the standard
[1:24:29] we're not cold
[1:24:31] to be some soft preaching men Pleasers
[1:24:37] we're called to hold a standard of Truth
[1:24:39] and a standard against sin
[1:24:42] and if things need to be addressed they
[1:24:44] get addressed
[1:24:45] if things need to be preached on they
[1:24:47] get preached on
[1:24:48] listen that's funny that's one of the
[1:24:50] parts of the book of Acts people don't
[1:24:52] like to talk about
[1:24:53] but you know that almost every time I I
[1:24:55] won't go there that's almost a
[1:24:57] an exaggeration many times
[1:25:00] when brother Brown would reference the
[1:25:02] book of Acts his reference would be
[1:25:03] ananias and Sapphira
[1:25:05] he'd say we need to get back to the book
[1:25:07] of Acts to where if you walked in the
[1:25:09] church with something in your life it
[1:25:10] got called out publicly right there
[1:25:13] oh we don't want that book of that
[1:25:16] but what if it hurt my feelings
[1:25:21] I tell you what your Prophet said he
[1:25:23] said I've often wanted to come into a
[1:25:25] church
[1:25:26] I've longed to see it
[1:25:29] I guess where I could walk in the back
[1:25:31] door front door wherever it was look
[1:25:33] across an audience and see a perfect
[1:25:34] Church all in order
[1:25:36] sin couldn't stay there no the spirit
[1:25:38] would call it out you see it just
[1:25:41] couldn't stay like ananias and Sapphira
[1:25:43] you just couldn't do it there'd be no
[1:25:45] sin in that group no sir the spirit
[1:25:47] quickly speak it like that he snaps his
[1:25:50] fingers no matter what it was how little
[1:25:53] it would be done see women men sitting
[1:25:55] there under the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:57] the spirit of God moving perfectly
[1:25:59] moving this someone had done something
[1:26:01] wrong in the Congress congregation
[1:26:03] couldn't be they couldn't they come
[1:26:06] quickly and confess it before the spirit
[1:26:07] got a hold to confess it before and come
[1:26:10] tell it because they know right then
[1:26:11] it's going to be called that's right
[1:26:13] that's the Church of the Living God how
[1:26:16] my old poor heart now it's getting old
[1:26:18] now but I've longed to stand and see a
[1:26:21] church like that I may yet I hope to
[1:26:28] I'm just saying
[1:26:30] that's part of the book of Acts we don't
[1:26:32] talk about a whole lot but brother Brown
[1:26:33] did often
[1:26:35] what was he saying there's a standard to
[1:26:38] be uphill
[1:26:39] and many are sitting there not holding
[1:26:42] the standard up but claiming it
[1:26:45] he says I hope to be in a church where
[1:26:46] those things get called out
[1:26:48] and if you read it carefully he didn't
[1:26:50] even say the pastor he said where would
[1:26:51] move on the spirit of somebody else and
[1:26:53] they'd call it out would we get mad
[1:27:03] just all of a sudden in pre-service Mike
[1:27:05] Dexter stands up and I ain't gonna call
[1:27:06] somebody else's name but looks over here
[1:27:08] across the church and says you did such
[1:27:10] and such you need to repent of it
[1:27:14] hopefully that was towards the altar
[1:27:21] we can't be standard bearers and be
[1:27:23] afraid of Correction
[1:27:28] see that's a standard or a landmark that
[1:27:30] people have let down right there
[1:27:32] that the house of God is where
[1:27:34] correction begins
[1:27:36] brother Brown says judgment begins at
[1:27:38] the house of God here's where we are
[1:27:40] judged it isn't a and isn't it a pity
[1:27:42] and when we see that we're wrong and
[1:27:44] doing the wrong thing living the wrong
[1:27:46] kind of Life Associated wrong and
[1:27:48] everything that we're just not big
[1:27:50] enough to walk up and say God I'm sorry
[1:27:51] I'm the one drawing you're right and I'm
[1:27:54] wrong and you forgive me and help me to
[1:27:56] do better the next time it wasn't that
[1:27:58] big a dude that was the end of it
[1:28:00] the big Parts overcoming your pride
[1:28:04] that part's simple he said just help me
[1:28:06] to do better next time
[1:28:09] if we just would be that real about
[1:28:11] ourselves but we don't we hear the
[1:28:14] gospel preach and say well I don't
[1:28:16] believe it that way
[1:28:18] listen the gospel like to tickle our
[1:28:19] ears and I know we slowed down a minute
[1:28:22] I'm just gonna try to pick us back up
[1:28:23] fast enough to land so we don't crash
[1:28:26] but the gospel like to tickle our ears
[1:28:28] it's hard sometimes
[1:28:30] it hurts sometimes
[1:28:32] but I'll take that if it gets me ready
[1:28:36] Lord stomp on my toes preach on my life
[1:28:39] Call My Name whatever it takes but let
[1:28:42] my judgment be right here let me get
[1:28:44] ready right here let me stand correction
[1:28:47] in the house of God do whatever it takes
[1:28:49] let me be humble enough so on that day I
[1:28:53] won't have to be judged let me lift up
[1:28:55] the standard now as one that's willing
[1:28:57] to be corrected willing to be preached
[1:28:59] on willing to be talked to Lord if I
[1:29:02] need it please do it here do it now
[1:29:05] correct me in this place let my
[1:29:08] judgments be here Lord
[1:29:11] thank you
[1:29:15] he's helped me keep my spirit right
[1:29:20] being a standard Bearer is a great
[1:29:23] responsibility
[1:29:24] and it comes with great Danger
[1:29:27] because standard bearers lead the charge
[1:29:30] standards I know we're talking about
[1:29:32] things we live up to but in it's
[1:29:34] interchangeable standards or are the
[1:29:36] colors
[1:29:37] or or they're the flag they're the
[1:29:39] battle flag of your unit
[1:29:41] in ancient times they would be called
[1:29:43] standards or banners
[1:29:45] and somebody's got to lift the standard
[1:29:47] Somebody's gotta lift the banner up huh
[1:29:49] it shows other soldiers young people
[1:29:52] where they are
[1:29:53] it shows where is my unit making a stand
[1:29:56] at where are we fighting at some in the
[1:30:00] midst of the chaos of battle get turned
[1:30:02] around they get wounded they get
[1:30:04] offended they get hurt those things
[1:30:05] happen remember this is a battle we
[1:30:07] talked about that and they get
[1:30:08] disoriented and they're looking around
[1:30:10] and what are they looking for they're
[1:30:11] looking for the banner
[1:30:13] they're looking for the standard where's
[1:30:15] my unit
[1:30:16] where's my group at where's the charge
[1:30:19] at and they look and they look and in
[1:30:21] the midst of all that they can locate
[1:30:23] that they look for the flag of their
[1:30:24] unit
[1:30:25] it says if in the course of a fight
[1:30:28] you're separated from your unit one
[1:30:29] would look around until they would see
[1:30:31] the standard and then they would try to
[1:30:33] get back close to it
[1:30:35] the standard bear in battle is in the
[1:30:37] center of the front line so that all the
[1:30:40] troops know where to go
[1:30:42] but it also shows the enemy where to
[1:30:44] shoot
[1:30:48] it shows where the charge is coming
[1:30:50] young people every gun in hell is
[1:30:52] trained on you
[1:30:54] this isn't for the faint-hearted this
[1:30:57] isn't for the weak in spirit this ain't
[1:30:59] for the ones that's going to run scared
[1:31:01] and that's why he called you
[1:31:03] he knew what you were made out of he
[1:31:06] knew you were made out of stuff that
[1:31:07] don't Bluff
[1:31:08] that's why when the bullets start flying
[1:31:10] and people start saying well we don't
[1:31:12] need all that emotion no more the days
[1:31:14] of Miracles has passed it doesn't matter
[1:31:16] how you dress all y'all's church is just
[1:31:18] old-fashioned oh y'all are just a whole
[1:31:20] whole bunch of Holy Rollers those
[1:31:23] bullets start flying all around you you
[1:31:24] don't turn and run you don't back down
[1:31:26] off your testimony you don't get scared
[1:31:28] you just raise the banner a little bit
[1:31:30] hard yeah that's me that's us that's
[1:31:32] where we stand right here boys this is
[1:31:35] where we're fighting right here this is
[1:31:37] where we're standing we're called to
[1:31:39] carry the standard

[1:31:43] attack listen this bride will not be
[1:31:46] lukewarm about this word she will have a
[1:31:49] passion for truth she will have a
[1:31:51] passion for her Homeland she will fight
[1:31:53] to protect her Homeland if it costs me
[1:31:56] friends if it cost me popularity with it
[1:31:59] bring struggle into my life I don't care

[1:32:03] gospel for the entire Truth for the
[1:32:06] message the way it was presented

[1:32:12] we're gonna preach and live the whole
[1:32:14] message that's the young people in this
[1:32:16] church I believe that with my whole
[1:32:18] heart
[1:32:19] and listen the message preached exactly
[1:32:22] the way it was delivered will produce
[1:32:24] exactly what the message promises it
[1:32:26] will produce
[1:32:28] oh we want to leave parts off and preach
[1:32:30] half of it and preach this part of it
[1:32:31] and then blame the message when it don't
[1:32:33] produce the results you want to see
[1:32:34] you've got to embrace the whole thing
[1:32:37] you've got to preach the whole message

[1:33:27] habits they couldn't overcome it will
[1:33:29] produce what it promised it would
[1:33:31] produce but we got to quit moving the
[1:33:33] landmarks
[1:33:35] quit changing the standards and then
[1:33:37] criticizing those that still hold them
[1:33:44] well maybe we can just let our young
[1:33:46] people do a little of this
[1:33:48] maybe we shouldn't be so horrible
[1:33:52] I'm looking at a group of young people
[1:33:53] that love it just the way the prophet
[1:33:55] gave it
[1:33:57] I believe we got a group of young people
[1:33:58] we can be proud of we got a group of
[1:34:01] young people that's standing in the most
[1:34:02] evil day living the message to its

[1:34:15] yourself quit letting the devil talk
[1:34:16] down to you
[1:34:18] we ain't gotta lower no standards
[1:34:22] I heard a story
[1:34:24] about a standard Bearer in battle and
[1:34:26] they were attacking this enemy position
[1:34:29] and things weren't going so well they'd
[1:34:31] been shot to pieces
[1:34:33] they've been shot to Pieces but the one
[1:34:34] with the standard the one with the
[1:34:36] banner had made it further up the hill
[1:34:38] than anybody else and he was up there in
[1:34:40] the general decided that the battle was
[1:34:42] lost and he needed to retreat we got too
[1:34:44] many of those Generals in the pulpits
[1:34:47] but he decided that the battle was lost
[1:34:49] and that they did they was getting shot
[1:34:51] up and it wasn't a worthy cause enemy
[1:34:54] fire was strong and they were being shot
[1:34:55] to pieces and the general deemed the
[1:34:58] battle law so he calls to the standard
[1:34:59] Bearer and he orders him he says bring
[1:35:02] back the flag and the standard Bearer
[1:35:05] calls back over his shoulder and says I
[1:35:07] will not bring back the flag how about
[1:35:09] you bring up your men
[1:35:11] come on church we ain't got to lower the
[1:35:14] standards how about you bring up the men

[1:37:43] for a minute and hurt you
[1:37:46] some of y'all need to quit siding with
[1:37:48] the accuser of the brethren
[1:37:49] every time somebody gets a shout and a
[1:37:51] dancing Runway I happen to know that
[1:37:53] they shouted in church one time and then
[1:37:54] they had sin in their life
[1:37:57] accused day and night

[1:38:17] in your life and the spirit of God moves
[1:38:19] instead of running the aisles you should
[1:38:20] run to the altar
[1:38:21] 100 percent
[1:38:23] I'm on board with that but I also
[1:38:25] believe those that struggle and fight
[1:38:27] and battle the hardest they worship the
[1:38:29] hardest too

[1:39:05] struggling but they're next to me on the
[1:39:07] firing line I got no problem with their

[1:48:59] standard Bearer right here
[1:49:01] and to draw the sword with me amen I'm
[1:49:05] going to be speaking Lord willing on on
[1:49:07] Sunday morning I've got some things that
[1:49:10] the Lord has been dealing with my heart
[1:49:12] and so I know that it's going to be
[1:49:14] wonderful
[1:49:15] amen for you what we have
[1:49:19] some great services that are laying
[1:49:22] ahead for these young people that are
[1:49:24] going
[1:49:25] and uh we heard we heard tonight the the
[1:49:28] charge the exhortation there and I just
[1:49:32] wanted to kind of re-emphasize some of
[1:49:34] those things as we are gathered and I
[1:49:37] know the bus is already here and you're
[1:49:39] going to be leaving here in just a few
[1:49:40] minutes
[1:49:41] but again you know when when you're
[1:49:44] there there will should be no shame in
[1:49:48] seeking more of God
[1:49:50] absolutely no shame nobody should go to
[1:49:53] Camp saying I got all I need that's
[1:49:55] laodicea laodicea says I have need of
[1:49:59] nothing
[1:50:00] so you know whether it's me or whether
[1:50:04] it's you we uh we need more of Jesus we
[1:50:09] need a greater and a deeper experience
[1:50:11] and God to just reveal himself to us in
[1:50:14] a greater way and so you are you of
[1:50:18] course are the the rallying point in the
[1:50:21] face of attack and we are sending you
[1:50:23] forth there too to to to be a part of
[1:50:26] that meeting realizing we're at War for
[1:50:29] the souls of men and because of that you
[1:50:33] know we want to make sure that our
[1:50:35] Behavior our action and and everything
[1:50:38] that we do will help another Soul find
[1:50:42] Jesus now this is really important
[1:50:44] because a lot of times you know you you
[1:50:47] get together and young people can
[1:50:49] distract one another don't be a
[1:50:52] distraction to each other do what you
[1:50:54] can to encourage one another to press in
[1:50:57] with all of your heart and you raise the
[1:51:00] standard as as our youth will be going
[1:51:02] forth from here to lead the charge I
[1:51:06] have that kind of confidence in you
[1:51:08] we're here in the championship round and
[1:51:11] God has trusted you to to raise the
[1:51:14] standard and um and it doesn't matter
[1:51:17] whether we're young or whether we're old
[1:51:19] listen that scripture brother Aaron read
[1:51:21] uh are quoted you know let no man
[1:51:24] despise our youth I I that was something
[1:51:27] that struck my heart when he when Paul
[1:51:29] told that to Timothy and I said hey I'm
[1:51:32] a I'm a Tim I'm a Timothy and so Paul
[1:51:36] said let no man despise thy youth so I
[1:51:38] took that to heart when I was 15 years
[1:51:40] old nobody was going to despise my youth
[1:51:43] amen I was going to serve God I was
[1:51:46] going to put everything that I had into
[1:51:47] it I was going to lift a standard and I
[1:51:51] was going to encourage others and so you
[1:51:54] know we we went forth to lead the charge
[1:51:56] we're still doing that here at evening
[1:51:59] light Tabernacle we are people that we
[1:52:02] are not we're not so much following what
[1:52:05] others are doing we are leading the
[1:52:07] charge going down the path of
[1:52:10] righteousness toward the Rapture and so
[1:52:12] we're holding the standard here in this
[1:52:15] end time now it is of course wherever
[1:52:19] gun of hell is
[1:52:22] um trained on you and and but I God has
[1:52:26] confidence in calling you from this day
[1:52:28] and this hour for for the purpose now I
[1:52:32] want you to know I love every one of you
[1:52:34] and I think we have the greatest group
[1:52:37] of young people that there is in the
[1:52:40] entire message around the world you are
[1:52:43] the best
[1:52:45] and I I want just to to know I want you
[1:52:49] to know that I know that you will do
[1:52:51] everything to
[1:52:53] um to hold that standard of being the
[1:52:56] best and uh whether you're on the bus in
[1:52:59] your conduct with you know sometimes
[1:53:01] this Close Quarters with male and female
[1:53:04] and sometimes um you know we we want to
[1:53:08] we get in High Spirits and want to
[1:53:11] Heckle and joke around you know and make
[1:53:13] things difficult for other people but I
[1:53:16] know you won't do that I know you're
[1:53:17] that kind of young people that will
[1:53:20] respect one another and respect the
[1:53:24] counselors that are at the camp and
[1:53:26] those that are riding on the bus and so
[1:53:29] I I have ever been a confidence in you
[1:53:32] that you're going to be the best and I
[1:53:34] want to thank you in advance because you
[1:53:37] know you just you show that over and
[1:53:39] over and over that you're that kind of
[1:53:41] young people you show that here at the
[1:53:43] church in the way they that you act
[1:53:46] believe that you behave and conduct
[1:53:48] yourself and I know you will show your
[1:53:50] that that
[1:53:52] um on on the bus and there uh on in the
[1:53:55] camp and come back where we will have a
[1:53:58] reporter brother Tim that you have the
[1:54:00] greatest and best young people that
[1:54:03] there is and and and that's the kind of
[1:54:05] report I got back last time so you know
[1:54:08] why would I expect anything less of you
[1:54:10] than to see that same and I know that's
[1:54:13] what it will be and God's going to be
[1:54:15] with you he's going to do great things
[1:54:18] in your life he's going to give you a a
[1:54:22] recharge some of you he will fill with
[1:54:25] the Holy Spirits others he will refill
[1:54:27] others he will gift you in certain ways
[1:54:30] or reveal something to you you're going
[1:54:33] to receive something from God and God's
[1:54:36] going to speak to you in a very clear
[1:54:39] and direct way and so as you were
[1:54:43] exhorted no don't wait till the last
[1:54:46] service go expecting God to meet me on
[1:54:50] the from the very first service on and I
