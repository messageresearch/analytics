[Music] [Applause] [Music] is amen we're thankful for his grace this evening amen we have several several requests we want to make mention before the lord i want to continue to remember to pray for brother ron during this time as the lord just does a healing work in his body from the cancer also sister erica parker and the different ones that are sick and body around the world with like the covet virus just pray that the lord would heal and protect those and i also have a prayer request that was just sent in through the email from sister carolyn westerfield said please remember sister betty nall from indiana she needs a healing miracle for the lord of the lord in her body we know how god spared sister karen's life and we're asking god to come on the scene for her too please also remember her family in prayer amen so a number of number of needs tonight if you have a need you want to just lift to the lord as brother joe adams opens the service for us in prayer amen let's just take these together to him amen you're glad to be in the house of the lord this evening you believe we serve a living god amen just you know we see all the chaos that's going on around us but yet this year we've probably seen the most miracles that we have have witnessed in one church maybe even in our our church congregation here and those that we affiliate with we've seen god move time and time and time again letting us know that he's not forsaking his children and i believe we should continually be under expectation and i trust tonight when you lift your hands that you got a need that you have an expectation that will meet that need there's a god here he's a living god and he's ready tonight to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can even ask or think tonight and i would just ask i have an unspoken request for sister rachel and for our family just pray that you would bind us and that god knows the need and the situation there and i believe we serve a mighty god and i also just want to interject real quick before we go to prayer you know many times we can believe god for the supernatural of healing and deliverance and brain bleeds and cancer and you know different things of that nature but how many of you have a lost loved one out there and it looks like an impossible case the same god that can heal brain bleeds and deliver cancer is the same god that can bring the prodigal back and i believe sometimes we put more on the impossible and than that than we do the supernatural of healing but yet he's the same god so whatever your need is tonight god does the impossible you got wayward children he does the impossible and i want you to know tonight you found favor with god and god's here to move so let's elevate our faith and trust god to do exactly what he said he will do you ask anything in my name and i'll bring it to pass so father we bow before your throne tonight and lord we do believe that with all our heart lord we believe that you petitioned us as your children we have been taught by the word that we can ask anything from the heavenly father and lord we know that you'll withhold no good thing from us that walk uprightly lord our conscience is clear our motive and our objective is right lord we don't seek these things lord for personal gain but father we're believing for our children we're believing for the wayward father the wayward mother lord whoever it may be we're believing tonight lord for those who are bound by cancer and some other torment and spirit of unbelief we believe that you're a living god and we believe tonight god that we're the recipients of the promise and we're asking tonight that you just move on the scene lord may you bind every hindering spirit that's here tonight god and may the power of the word be released among us may healing and deliverance be released tonight god may salvation be released tonight lord may the word of god lord ministry with faith be released tonight father that the sick can be healed or the torment can be delivered and lord the mother and the father can believe for that wayward son or daughter of god may you just come tonight lord in a special way in a personal way god and begin to minister to his father expressly lord you saw the hands that were lifted and you saw the need that was represented but you also see the expectation lord we came tonight believing tonight we came tonight trusting lord that our need to be met and you'll supply the answer and we're asking tonight father that you'll do that for every hand every heart whether it be here locally or those on the internet father may that hand went up god may the word of god come down and baptize that one lord with the desire of their heart tonight and may you just move lord lord we ask that you move for brother ron you see the cancer now in his eye but we rebuke it in the name of jesus christ the god that's a healer of deliverance of cancer and whatever else form it wants to hide in tonight lord we denouncing in the name of jesus and we're trusting you and we're taking you at your word we also pray the same for sister erica parker lord a young mother lord god who's been through so much already lord in just a few years the lord we just believe tonight that you're gonna use this for a testimony of the power of god in the midst of all the darkness around us in the midst of all the chaos that is going on in our country yet there's a god that heals there's a god that delivers there's a god that sets free and lord god we're the recipients of that eternal blessing then we ask tonight that you

lift up your name and ask you humbly to please come by lord we feel you near already and we give you this time now lord in jesus name we pray these things amen and amen if you'll turn in the word with me tonight to luke the first chapter in the 26th verse luke the first chapter and the 26th verse we're going to read this entire account of when gabriel the angel came and visited mary luke 1 26 it says in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary and the angel came in unto her and said hell thou art highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou has found favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said mary unto the angel how shall this thing be seeing i know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god and behold thy cousin elizabeth she hath also conceived his son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren for with god nothing shall be impossible and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her may god add his blessings now to the reading of the word i you can have your seats i'll tell you as we go along tonight it's not going to be any mystery what i'm trying to get across to you it's not going to be any mystery of what we're speaking about we're going to hammer this point and we're going to stay on this point as long as the lord would lead and the title tonight what i'm going to preach to you about is thou has found favor with god thou has found favor with god what i want you to do tonight right now before we even start is is take that and apply it to yourself i want you to take that favor and accept it for yourself right now for whatever situation you're in whatever you're facing we live in troubled times and sometimes we don't know which way to turn but in the midst of all that i want to announce to you that thou has found favor with god i don't think that there's anything else we need to know tonight there's anything else we need to hear if we can actually get that revelation to drop down into our heart if we could actually get that that true revelation right now to completely compass us about we could leave here so victorious over every situation over every sickness we could walk out as conquerors tonight knowing that i have favor with god almighty it's a wonderful thing to think about and that's what we're going to preach to you about tonight what an awesome account we find there in the scripture that we just read and many times brother brown would dramatize uh what went on the day before and the day of as mary met that angel you find him do it several times he does it in mary's belief and that's a lot of the message that i listened to and studied a lot as i was preparing for this sermon and brother branham would dramatize the account over and over and it just seems to come to life when brother branham takes something and begins to dramatize it i love to listen to him take an account or take a story and begin to put flesh on it and begin to talk about things and and it's not just a story when he tells it because we know the office that he held and and who he was i can hear that story and not think well that was a nice story i can hear that and go that's incredible that's how it was i know when he tells those things i know that that he has he has been able to see and look and and witness what actually went on so so they're not just stories we can take those things and actually apply the things that he says as he dramatizes those events and he talks about how joseph and mary had gone to service that day and how it had been a wonderful service and he said that the the rabbi had taught uh talked all about god bringing the children of israel out of egypt and how he had brought them through the red sea and he talked about how god took them out of the hand of the enemy with miracles and with power and and how by great signs and wonders for 40 years he had fed them in the wilderness he talked about how they came out of the wilderness on a 40-year journey with not a single feeble person among them how even their clothes didn't wear down and he began to proclaim what a great and mighty god that we had what a great god that was leading the children of israel and he goes on and brother branham says it was a wonderful message he said it was a wonderful service all these wonderful truths that the rabbi brought out but brother branham says at the end of it the rabbi ruined the whole thing he says he ruined the whole thing by saying god just doesn't operate like that anymore he said it's not necessary anymore the people have settled in the homeland and they don't need a god of miracles anymore i wonder how many messages today i wonder how many good messages how many wonderful messages today are ruined by that exact same thought process that comes forth over the pulpit wasn't god good wasn't god amazing in the way that he used to heal didn't god do amazing things in the past but god just doesn't do those things anymore he did that to get people's attention he did that so people would recognize there was a prophet but now that the people have been settled in the homeland we don't need that god of miracles anymore now that we've settled down in this place and everything's as it was this is where god was taking us this is what he was trying to accomplish i don't believe that for a minute i believe that god's purpose is yet fulfilled because his purpose was to get a people that could overcome in this land his purpose is to get somebody that's going to take a rapture and until that takes place we need a god of miracles we need a god that's on the scene for every situation we're going to face today and tomorrow and i'm glad i can announce you tonight he's still here he's still moving he is the same yesterday today and forever he is still the god of miracles i think too many times testimonies are told in a way to where they're just some ancient relic some ancient story we're giving this testimony to lift something up that used to happen instead of testimonies being told for the purpose that they were meant to be that is to elevate your faith for the miracles we need today testimonies are to tell you what god can do right now it's not to tell you what he used to do i'm telling you a testimony because today you need him today i need him and if he did it yesterday he'll do it tonight if he did it yesterday he'll do it tomorrow testimonies are to prepare you for the miracles of today not to point to a time pass it's something that we must realize tonight that god wants to move in your situation he wants to move right now in your situation god wants to display his power on your behalf god is willing and god is able to move for whatever it is you're looking into tonight he's willing and he is able to move in that situation but he's looking for somebody who will take him at his word he's looking for somebody that will take him at his word and will believe no matter what the circumstances are listen he's not asking you that has a church to have a church that believes he's not worried necessarily about what the church he's wanting somebody that if the church don't believe it you believe it if the pastor don't believe it you believe it if your family don't believe it you believe it he's looking for somebody that doesn't care what everybody else believes but they take the word of god for themselves for their situation and they say lord i know you love me i know you died i know you took stripes i know you're the same today you can heal me right now you have healed me you can save my children you can save my spouse i believe it right now because you're still the god of miracles and he's looking for people like that you have to take god's word yourself for your situation the rabbi that day believed that the miraculous was a thing of the past brother brown said somehow that didn't satisfy the thirst and hunger of joseph and mary evening like tabernacle i pray that that type of preaching or that type of teaching will never satisfy the hunger that's in your soul may this church never become a place that would stand for or accept that type of thing that would take the power of god and put it in the past that would take the power of god make it a thing of yesterday a relic of the past listen a church or a person that makes god only a god of yesterday and only a god of the past eventually what's going to happen is they're going to dry up right where they're at there will be no progress there will be no altar calls there will be no soul saves you won't see any baptism taking place they may have great theology they may have great teaching they may be able to quote circles all around you and make your head spin but at the end of the day there ain't enough power there to heal a toothache there's not enough power there to get souls to the altar there's not enough power there to save people filled people with the holy ghost preach the deliverance of the bound because they put god in the past but i need god tonight i need god right now i need the god that opened the red sea to open up the seas in my life i need the god that fed the children of israel man in the wilderness i need him to feed my soul right now god i'm hungry and i know you can feed my soul right now there's a c in front of me and i know you can open it right now you did it once and i'm looking to you tonight god say open the sea for me open the sea for my need lord jesus i still believe in hebrews 13 8 i believe in john 14 12 we can't become satisfied with religion too many people are settling down on religion the message has become a religion instead of a personal relationship with the living god instead of he came and called my name and he's my friend and we fellowship and we talk he's there for me and he loves me and i love him and i'm gonna serve him all the days of my life it's become when we go to church on sundays and sometimes wednesdays that's what it's become that is a nominal life at best as a matter of fact there's a lot of good baptist and methodist people that outshine a lot of message people in their religion you can't compare to them they will outwork you they will out church attend you i don't think that's proper to say it that way but we said it church attend you it works you can't let it become about religion it's about you and god and a god that called your name a god that came to save your soul a god that came to heal your sick and save your children and save your husband and savior your wives he came to do all that for you it's not just about religion it's about a love affair with the lord jesus christ we can never let religion satisfy our souls brother branham says mary said you know since i heard the rabbi say that this great god that brought us here and made us what we are that he doesn't have to do things for us now like he did then i've been thinking for a long time that if this god was as great in the days of our fathers as he was in the days of our grandfathers then why isn't he just the same great god today brother brown says that's only good thinking that's only good thinking church it's only good thinking if it says he's the same yesterday today and forever than what we saw in the ministry in the healing revivals of the 1950s and 60s we can still see today if he's the same as he was then there's just as many needs as there was then i guarantee there's more needs than there was then and there's not any less power the power not only that i wouldn't say the power's the same i would say the power is increased as he has poured out more and more of himself into this world yes we see the tree of knowledge of good and evil it's reached his height that doesn't worry me none because there's another tree that's reached its height and it has unleashed its power and it's unreleased all it has for you in this day we have more than enough we have more than enough how dare us look at it and say you don't do that number what we're trying to say really is god can't do that anymore and we say he don't do those things to make excuses for why we don't see them in our home or make or why we don't see them in our church instead of just getting down repenting saying god i was wrong i need you to move i need you to move in our church i need you to move in our home just repent lay your pride down or admit you were wrong and let god move in your life let god move in your family we got people that don't think god moves that way anymore they got lost children lost loved ones i refuse to believe that i'm not going to believe something that would damn my children i'm going to say god go get them you can still do it i know you can i believe you will i'm holding on for them that's how i choose to believe mary wasn't satisfied mary wanted something more and she was not going to be disappointed the prophet would say that mary and joseph read from the scroll of isaiah that afternoon when they read about the coming savior unto us a child is born what a wonderful scripture what a wonderful scripture unto us us a child is born this is what she was dwelling on the next morning as she walked down that little path we find her dwelling on the word of god there's nothing better for you and i to dwell on there's nothing better for you and i to feed on there's nothing better for you now to put our time into i know sometimes we have a lot on our mind i know sometimes work may consume us we may be overwhelmed on the job and we come home with it that's what's on our mind work those are those are all things of life i know sometimes school may consume you you're caught up in school and i got to do this and i got to do that those are things you have to do i get that sometimes entertainment may consume your mind sometimes maybe it may be a video games for young people or social media and that ain't just for young people social media for grownups whatever stuff consumes our mind and sometimes it's things of life that that are understandable and we we have to take care of work we have to take care of school but then sometimes we fill our mind with things that really we have no excuse for at the end of the day we made a choice to fill our mind with that we made a choice to pick that up and consume that all day instead of consuming something that would benefit and edify us so many times it's a choice that we make and not necessarily something that we have to do but the point being you can never dwell on and consume enough or too much of the word of god and that's what we find mary dwelling on and thinking of as she walks down the street and what i want us to think about tonight is it's when we get our mind on him it's when we begin to think about him and it's when our conversation begins to center around him that's when you can have your visitation that's when god can move on the scene for you that's when an angel can come to your home that's when the atmosphere can get right for your need and for your miracle brother branham says he said hail mary you're highly favored before god oh i like that that little woman in the meanest city there was in the world at that time known the meatest meanest city anywhere in palestine and in there she had lived such a life until god chose her for a certain work that he was going to do there she looked into his face and it startled startled her you know it's usually as we were thinking on those things the bible said if there be any praise if there be any virtue think on these things i think the reason we don't see no more of it than we do is we got our minds on too many other things i think the angels would still appear to us if we only kept our minds upon them but we're thinking about something else that's where we're gonna go a certain program we gotta get back to look at or certain shopping that we got to do but our scripture tells us seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these other things will be added unto you and there when we see that he's talking about with mary when we see that in order we see a person who's seeking first the kingdom of god we see a person whose mind is on the lord we see that he said to her thou art highly favored before god i think back to that special day we had there at the lake house at brother tim's lake house there on lake clabor when brother ron came for a visit and we had a wonderful time there visiting and for several days and just talking about different things talking just the way friends talk you know then on that tuesday i believe it was it was a tuesday as the conversation took its course it began to turn towards the things of god we talked about different meetings that different ones had been in our experiences in those meetings we talked about the mighty things that we had seen god do and we talked about how wonderful he is and we talked about how faithful he is and as we begin to talk about these things you could feel him draw near in the room you could feel the atmosphere get right you could tell the waters were troubled you could just tell in that moment that it was the right time it was the right moment and in that moment brother tim recognizing it called everybody together and said we're going to prayer and we had a time of prayer with brother ron that was absolutely supernatural it was an amazing atmosphere an amazing experience really words fail me to describe the power of it brother ron said it felt like the walls of the house were breathing and in that moment because we got our mind on the things of god and because we talked about those things and we created an atmosphere that allowed him to draw near in the waters to be troubled brother ron received the touch and his testimony is he hasn't been the same from that day he's been re-energized he's he's preaching he's working he's doing everything he says i'm a new man and in that moment there as he's receiving that touch from god um andrew pruitt and luke pruitt and brother adam who had come there with brother ron all three of them in that moment when the waters are troubled had an experience with the god and received the baptism of the holy ghost and i'll never forget after andrew was prayed for and luke was prayed for he looks up at brother ron looks at adam and he says adam we drove 17 hours for a miracle while you're standing there you might as well get in while the water's troubled and i'm telling you tonight that when the angel draws near because you're talking about him and you're thinking about him and you're thinking about how good he is don't just stand there and let that moment pass you by don't stand there when the angel's moving through the build and when he's here and you have an opportunity recognize how precious the opportunity is recognize there's people that will go their whole life and not experience that opportunity you can have on a wednesday night or on a sunday here in this church or even in your home but right now in this service as he begins to move and the waters are troubled don't waste the opportunity get in the water allow him to do the work you need him to do how dares have so much disrespect that when the angel moves and the spirit moves through the building we can sit there with our arms crossed and just stare and look around like nothing's going on well i don't feel nothing well you ought to have enough about you to recognize when the presence of god is in the building if you can't recognize his presence in a service that says more about you than it does him if you can't recognize when people are being blessed and poured out it may not be for you that moment but go to prayer for those people begin to worship in god recognizing he's in your presence so that things can happen for other people i've said it before it's a shame that we can be so cold that we can sit there and backslidden people can come sit next to us and go to sleep what kind of atmosphere did you create that they can come sit there and snooze they ought to be terrified to sit next to you they ought to be so uncomfortable how can they drag their devils in and sit next to you and be comfortable they sit there dozing off they ought to be a shout out hallelujah and they go what was that what's going on let your praise and your worship wake up the sleeping virgins wake up the backsliders create an atmosphere where things can take place i'm not feeling anything that's okay it may be somebody else's night but do your part for that person i think it's wonderful how brother branham describes mary's thoughts and her entire life being centered around the coming messiah she's thinking about the coming messiah she's she's talking about she's seeking for a living god and that's what her mind is on and i find this so pertinent to us because of the trouble in the land at the time of mary's visitation with something that somewhat parallels the troubled times that we're living in we oftentimes don't think back in a historical context and i'm gonna do my best not to give you a history lesson but the angel's visit to mary occurred during a truthful a truly dreadful time in a land that was already a troubled land it was a time of religious and political upheaval throughout the land there were very violent rebellions that were taking place there were evil bloodthirsty leaders such as herod that were ruling over the land there was rome influencing everything and the jews themselves were separated into different religious and political factions that couldn't agree on anything even amongst themselves that's a that's a bleak picture yeah but that was the atmosphere and the condition of the world when jesus showed up that was the time that jesus came on the scene was in a time like that listen don't be discouraged by all the things you're seeing around you don't be discouraged by what you're seeing don't let those things get you down there have been end times before this isn't the first end time there have been end times before and every single time that there's an end time we see evil and wickedness and sin we see instability in the world and we see a climate that is not god friendly we see a climate in every end time that rejects god and rejects his people and pushes his people out there was an end time in noah's day genesis 6 5 says and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thought of his heart was only evil continually it was an evil time it was an end time there was an end time for sodom genesis 13 13 says but the men of sodom were wicked and sinners before the lord exceedingly and we're told in luke 17 that we can expect these same things in our day luke 17 26 as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the days of the son of man luke 17 28 likewise also as it was in the days of lot luke 17 30 even though shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed listen we have longed for and preached about and looked for the end time here we are if it doesn't really even take a spiritual person to look around and realize things aren't right there was a time for years i i have a lot of good what i would call nominal christian friends good people and we discussed the end time and it wasn't something they ever thought about they would say things like well we know he's going to come back one day but i don't think it'd be in my lifetime just it was just this one day one day one day but in the last few years you begin to hear them say things like man it's got to be close it's got to be close listen if they're recognizing it what about a people that received a message that told you many years ago that it was close of people that taught that were told exactly what to look for a people that knew the end time was upon us and yet some of us are walking around like the boy whistling past the graveyard acting like nothing's going on we are on the culmination of the wrapping up of all things we are standing on the brink of eternity we are standing where time is blending to eternity you are at the moment of receiving a body change the greatest miracle that has ever taken place on the face of the earth as the power of god's gonna sweep over a people and catch them up in a moment in a twinkling of an eye how can we act like nothing's happening it's all happening everything we've ever lived for everything we've heard preached about everything we've ever sung about it's happening right now [Music] it's happening right now you are in the middle of it we've prayed and long for the end time and what you are experiencing are end time conditions this was the ending of the jewish dispensation right in the middle of a wicked city right in the midst of their world completely falling apart there had been rebellions there had been riots sound familiar as a matter of fact many of the jews most of the jews believe that when the messiah came he was going to take part in these riots and these rebellions that shows you how tumultuous the time was they thought he was going to be a leader that was going to come in on a horse and i don't know maybe their rights are different from our rights he's gonna get spray paint and go put graffiti on everything and run i don't know what they expected they didn't get what they expected though and that's why they missed it there's a lot of people today that had so many preconceived notions of what was going to happen and they're missing it because it's not lining up with their thinking cast away your thinking we had a prophet coming this day and clear up everything so you didn't have to worry about your thinking he told us what to expect he told us what to look for he prepared us and here we are i feel like we're a well-prepared people they believed he would come and rid them of roman government overthrow the romans it was a world of constant unrest and in the middle of all that in the middle of constant unrest and riots and upheavals and this and that going on we find mary's mind is on the lord in the middle of all that her desire is i want a living god i want more than just a tradition i want more of that god i believe you're the same yesterday today and forever i don't think that you're just a god of the past i believe you can that's what her mindset was on not politics not factions not this not that but god i want more of you i want to see you real in my life i believe you've got everything in control and that has to be us tonight church god the world is falling apart around us but you're so good god i love you so much i want more of you tonight lord reveal yourself to me lord lord if i failed you in any way let me lay that aside let me lay my thoughts aside lord i want to draw closer to you i want i want to give you all that i am lord i know the words of evil i'm not worried about right now lord i'm thinking about you lord i'm walking towards you i'm trying to draw closer to you but this is going on impossible i'm not worried about that right now there's a riot i'm not worried about that god i need more of you my mind's on you i'm focused on you and that's how she was and she's walking down this path lord you're wonderful i want to experience more of you lord and all of a sudden flicker flicker oh god let there be a flicker of light in here tonight let somebody's eyes come open to what's going on and what's happening all around us flicker and then a pillar of fire and then an angel steps out of that pillar of fire with a message an angel steps out of that pillar of fire and he says hell thou art highly favored oh my the unrest didn't matter then brother joe the politics didn't matter at that moment brother joe the factions didn't matter at that moment none of those things met the rabbi's opinion of the god not doing the miraculous at this moment i promise you it didn't matter anymore she stood face to face with gabriel those things didn't matter anymore they had fallen away what did we receive in this day church what did we receive in this day a pillar of fire vindicating a message a message that told you you are highly favored a message that came and told you i chose you but i'm no good he didn't ask you if you were good he said i have chosen you you are highly favored church hear that tonight there's a messenger telling you you are highly favored of the lord he has chosen you he delights in you he loves you but what about my mistakes you are highly favored tonight he has chosen you tonight he loves you he's taking you in a rapture quit trying to talk your way out of it he chose you quit running from it he loves you he's taking you home he's going to get you you may go kicking and screaming because for some reason some people just want to bring up all the reasons they can't and he's telling you i love you i don't care quit saying those things just accept my favor just accept my favor tonight every end time has awful conditions every end time it seemed like satan turns the world mad but every end time had something else too every end time had someone that found favor with god abraham found favor noah found favor mary found favor and i would like to remind you tonight that you have found favor with god in the end time of all end times in the most wicked time the world has ever seen you have found favor with almighty god can we let that begin to elevate our faith a little bit tonight can we begin to turn our attention tonight away from the negatives of the end time and begin to acknowledge that if the world is getting in an end time condition there must be a people that are also getting in an end time condition if the world's in end time condition there's a bride in an end time condition if satan has reached his power there is a people with the full power of the living god it has reached its zenith and here we are in our end time condition you say oh i don't want to be in the end time condition i do i want to be in the end time condition for the bride that condition that's going to have him look over the banister and say they're ready they're ready and we get to such a place that our lives it begins to call him back we actually call for the rapture we call for the dead in christ to rise because we are in an end-time condition [Applause] brother tim put it so wonderful sunday we are the anointed ones at the end time in an end time condition there must be people in that condition you are that people you are highly favored there in verse 28 the angel says hell thou art highly favored come that's just in the written part he didn't say that comma thou art highly favored comma the lord is with thee the lord is with thee so what we recognize is that with his favor comes his never failing presence with his favor comes his never failing presence church the lord is with thee if you have his favor tonight the lord is with thee why should i fear then why should i worry what can satan do when the lord is with me when i have his favor upon my life when he has called me when he has chosen me and he is going before me and he is with me i have nothing to fear it's the exact same thing he told gideon over in judges 6 right before he gave him his commission he says the lord is with thee think about that for just a second the lord is with you the angel is about to ask mary to believe something that seems impossible to the human mind the angel is about to tell her that she's going to have a child even though she knows no man and what does the angel tell her to raise her faith to meet the challenge of what it is she's about to hear thou art highly favored and the lord is with thee these are the two things he gives her to elevate her faith so that when she hears these things she doesn't respond like zechariah responded to elevate her faith to a place that she's able to respond in a way that pleases the lord thou art highly favored and the lord is with thee listen church there may be great challenges ahead i don't know what lies just around the curve or just over the men there may be great challenges there may be great storms some of you may already be in the midst of one of the greatest storms of your life i know there are great miracles that lay just ahead i know there's a body change that lays just ahead i know there's a rapture that lays just ahead and what did our message tell us to elevate our faith to the place that we can receive and meet the challenge of the hour thou art highly favored and the lord is with thee listen he told us the lord is with you he said i am not a dead god i am not a god of history i am not a god of the past but night after night service after service time after time he came and he declared i am here i have not left you alone i'm not a god in a history book somewhere but i am with you i am an ever-present help in the time of need time after time i'm here i can hear a prophet of god say he's here he's here because he hasn't left us he's favored us and he will never leave us the never failing presence of almighty god is in this building tonight and he is here to show you favor amen i am with you brother branham says and now we pray heavenly father that you will continue to be with us and help us as we journey on each and every one of us give us thy undergirding power and the faith of knowing that thy never failing presence will be with us in that hour when we cannot help ourselves we know the angels of god are encamped about those who fear him and they will bear us up lest at any time we dash our foot against the stone church it's not a time for us to be dwelling on our favor on our failures it's not a time for us to look at how possible it may seem we've heard two wonderful services from brother joe impossible doesn't mean nothing to god god solves impossible situations it's not a time to question really me but but but i've done so many things wrong but you don't understand my i think god understands your past there's nothing you can tell him that he don't know and yet we seem so intent on telling him all the reasons we can't live up to what he wants us he knows hello that's why he provided a way that's why he provided a sacrifice that's why he made a way for you because he already knows you're not surprising him he's not going i picked you my bad no he don't have my bads he don't make mistakes he's not telling you you're highly favored tonight just to get your hopes up and when you leave he's gonna go yeah they don't stand a chance that's not our god our god is true our god is faithful and if he's telling you that you are highly favored and if he's telling you that his presence is with you it's because it's the truth it's because he's called you and he's chose you and he's gonna see you all the way through there is nothing gonna stop this bride there is nothing gonna stop this bride i'm telling you right now he said i will have a bride that will be without spot and without wrinkle and i don't know how he's gonna do it i look at myself and i go i myself would mess up that whole plan i would be a spot i would be a regal but he says no i already thought about that i provided everything i took away every blemish i took away every sin i took away every failure and now you are highly favored hallelujah i'm so insignificant yes you are so am i but not to him i'm so full of problems i'm so i'm so listen it's not about what you can do this isn't about how good you are this is about you have found favor brother branham says i love this hail mary blessed art thou amongst women thou hast found favor with god o church hail blessed are you among the people for you have found favor with god you've believed for eternal life and gods give you the baptism of the holy ghost hell church you are highly favored you are highly favored quit putting it over there i know that person is you are highly favored tonight it's time that you receive the favor that he's trying to give you if we're going to bring forth the return of the promised son if we're going to produce all the word says that we're going to produce we must respond to god's favor the same way that mary responded to it if we're going to bring these things forth we got to move beyond our self-pity we gotta move beyond woe is me and move a little bit closer to be it unto me we got too many people saying woe is me woe is me i just need you to move over here and say be it unto me is not that much different in words it's not that much harder to say just let it come out of your soul lord whatever it is you have my circumstances aren't perfect my situation isn't perfect but i hear a word tonight saying i'm highly favored and i just want to respond and say lord be it unto me let that be who i am tonight six months before this visitation with mary gabriel visited zacharias in the temple in luke 1 5 it says there was in the days of herod the king of judea a certain priest named zacharias of the course of abia and his wife was of the daughters of aaron and her name was elizabeth and they were both righteous before god walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the lord blameless and they had no child because that elizabeth was barren and they both were now well stricken in years brother branham talks about how zacharias actually had examples in the scripture and he had no reason to doubt whereas mary actually had something harder to believe because it was something that had never happened and when i looked back and i looked at abraham and sarah it's amazing there's literally a scripture that is almost identical to that scripture and it's in genesis 18 11. it says now abraham and sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be sarah to be with sarah after the manner of women luke 1 7 says they had no child because elizabeth was barren and they were both now well stricken in years it's literally almost the same situation and him being a priest you know he knows the story well he knows that this has happened before skip down to verse 11 of luke 1 and it says and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense and when zechariah saw him he was troubled and fear fell upon him but the angel said unto him fear not zacharias for thy prayer is heard now wife elizabeth shall bear thee a son thou shalt call his name john and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth listen to this salutation it's absolutely wonderful you're going to have joy and you're going to have gladness he shall be great in the sight of the lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the holy ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children of israel shall he turn to the lord their god this is wonderful this is powerful and he shall go before him in the spirit and the power of elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the lord listen church this is big this this is good news there has never been a message quite like this delivered to a person what a message and the thing is what's amazing about this look zechariah probably fits and run the house he's fixing to jump and shout and give praise and glory and receive this message and this is all i can't wait to see how he responds here what what a message he says listen you've been praying and asking for a child i don't know if you noticed that in the very beginning he said this is an answer to your prayer zacharias has been praying for this he's been praying oh zechariah your prayers have been heard not only will you and elizabeth have a son but he's going to be great in the sight of the lord not only are you going to have a son but he's going to be filled with the holy ghost even from his mother's womb many are going to turn to god because of your son this is wonderful he will be the forerunner oh praise the lord and zechariah says unto the angel whereby shall i know this for i'm an old man and my wife is well stricken in years church this was his prayer this was what he'd been asking for and now the angel comes to tell him your prayers have been heard and not only that as god usually does he's going above and beyond not only are you going to have a son but look how awesome this is going to be he's the forerunner he's going to turn a nation back to their god can you believe this is that i said i can't no i can't believe that i wonder sometimes if we're expecting to receive the things we're asking for can we accept it when the word pronounces you healed i've been praying a long time for this you're hilton you don't know how i feel right now i'm telling you by his stripes you're healed no you don't understand what i'm telling you i'm hurting can we accept it when the word gives us what it is we've been asking for can we accept it when the word says that your children are going to be saved you don't know my children you're right i probably don't but the word says that they'll be there in their offspring with them so i'm just going to hold on to that regardless of the case regardless of your situation i'm just going to hold on he's given me no reason to doubt him i'm not going to start doubting now can we accept it when the lord says when the word tells us that the promise is unto you i just can't receive the baptism of the holy ghost i've tried it ain't about trying it's about receiving it's about accepting he gave it to you quit arguing with him and accept the favor that he's trying to give you here tonight or do we respond tonight like zacharias instead of like mary one bible scholar says that this was not a humble petition for the confirmation of his faith but a peevish objection against what was said to him as altogether incredible or impossible as if he would have said i can never be made to believe this i can never be made to believe this verse 19 and the angel answered said unto him i am gabriel something tells me that his tone probably changed a little bit after zechariah's response i'm thinking that it wasn't quite so friendly and warm at first it was like fear not you know there are this wonderful thing's about to happen i don't believe you i am gabriel at this point he might have had a little reason to fear oh that's just that's just me his tone changed a little bit i am gabriel that stand in the presence of god and i have sent to speak unto thee and to show thee these glad tidings and behold you shall be dumb and not be able to speak listen doubt and fear are contagious and he was in a situation where he knew mary was fitting to have to receive a miracle he knew these things were in the season of miracles and i'm not going to have you spreading your doubt i'm not going to have you spreading your unbelief i am going to shut your mouth listen it's time to tune out the messengers of doubt it's time to tune out those that will tell you god don't do that anymore god may not shut their mouths but you can shut your ears and tell them i'm not listening to you i don't care if it comes over social media or facebook or across a pulpit if they're a messenger of doubt don't listen to them so he shuts his mouth listen what he said was completely different from what mary said there was a time when i was younger and i'd look at it and mary would said well how will this thing be and then i would read where the prophet says she never questioned anything she and i'm like well i mean i don't know that looks like a question i'm just saying but i'm moving on but the difference is if you actually get into it and look at what mary is saying it's just a question of okay i believe this how are you going to do it's almost inquisitive how are you going to do it she's excited by the news that she has received she's excited by the news she said in other words how would i how can i at this time conceive a child when i know not a man she's asking this because it's it's simply look i know the messiah is going to be virgin born i get it and now i'm the virgin this is good i'm excited now can you can you tell me how it's going to happen in other words this wasn't a language of distrust or a language of that it was simply a request for a little bit more instruction can you just tell me a little bit more can you tell me and i think that's the attitude of every real christian we sit here and the lord begins to speak to us and and we sit there can you tell me just a little bit more can you instruct me just a little bit more i like what i'm hearing you said there's going to be a bride you said there's going to be a rapture tell me a little bit more feed me a little bit more i want to know a little bit more about what it is you're doing lord feed me tell me a little bit more i believe you lord i believe you but i just want a little bit more of it tonight and that's what mary's saying can you just give me a little bit more can you tell me how you're going to do it there's there's an air of excitement about it this isn't a language of doubt it's a language of excitement luke 1 35 and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god listen once she's told that it's going to be done by the power of the holy ghost there ain't no more questions from her i love how she asked this little question and then he answered there's no more doubt it completely sufficed her that's good enough for me how's this going to happen the holy ghost is going to do it perfect that's good enough for me so you're telling me i have his favor i have a promise of a child and you're telling me the holy ghost is going to do it okay i believe i accept it be it unto me lord according to your word that is a perfect recipe for receiving everything you have need of that is the perfect recipe for overcoming anything the devil can throw at you okay lord i have your favor i'm promised joy all right and the power of the holy ghost is going to break this depression off my life i accept it be it unto me lord you said i promise peace i have your favor and the holy spirit's going to come and break this anxiety off of me i accept it lord i have your favor i have the promise of a child how's it going to be the holy ghost is going to overshadow thee and that's how it's going to happen okay i accept it i accept it tonight lord jesus if we can just take that recipe we can overcome anything i have his favor i have a promise and the holy ghost is going to give it to me if it's good enough for mary it's good enough for me it ought to be good enough for each and every one of us here in this building tonight oh my how wonderful that is just tell me a little bit more yes listen i can't stand up here tonight and say i am gabriel i'm not gabriel tonight but i got a message for you those things you've been praying for they're about to come to pass those things you've been asking for they're about to happen the miracles you've been looking for they're about to happen you've been

but you're favored man faces so many troubles so many trials they do but glory to god we face them with the favor of god in our life we face them with a rapture at the end we face them with the faith

every single wave around that ship you talk about torment yeah they knew what it was to have torment but he hung around a little bit too long because one of them looked up and said who's walking this way there's somebody walking this way church i see him walking this way tonight i see him walking this way tonight that storm said it's going to sink you and jesus said here i come here i come he's walked into your ship he's walking to your situation he's walking in your life to set you free to change the situation in a moment in a twinkling of an eye oh he's going to change the situation in
