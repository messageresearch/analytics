[25:53] for her family
[25:54] lost a very close friend of ours in a
[25:56] head-on collision his name was tristan
[25:59] pennington

[26:05] terry roncalli's wife marilyn
[26:08] had put a stint in her leg and there's
[26:09] still very little blood flow
[26:11] i also want to remember
[26:13] uh beverly roncalli
[26:15] prayers she has covered
[26:18] as well and
[26:19] says lord to be merciful on her behalf i
[26:22] also want to remember a very serious
[26:23] need
[26:24] brother mike walls and his church
[26:27] but mike wallace is a pastor there in
[26:29] washington d.c area
[26:31] very wonderful brother in the lord and
[26:34] we've grown to love him very much in his
[26:36] stand for the lord but
[26:39] his song leader's wife
[26:40] [Music]
[26:42] gave birth to their fourth child
[26:44] on wednesday
[26:46] on thursday morning she was having
[26:48] severe headaches and
[26:49] the doctors kept upping the strength of
[26:52] the medication
[26:54] about 1 pm she went into cardiac rest
[26:57] and at that point she's been she's had a
[26:59] severe stroke in the brain

[27:03] to the brain
[27:04] her husband michael is still believing
[27:06] very strongly that the lord will restore
[27:08] her
[27:09] so we appreciate your prayers for this

[1:10:01] you know they'll be marrying young men
[1:10:03] here and perhaps and you'll be putting
[1:10:06] permanent roots down so you want to make
[1:10:08] sure wherever you're going

[1:10:35] closer and our families get larger and
[1:10:38] larger and and we reach out and
[1:10:40] encompass uh even
[1:10:42] more more people
[1:10:44] you at evening like tabernacle you don't
[1:10:47] talk about nobody
[1:10:50] because they're kind to somebody

[1:12:17] just ask the lord's blessings
[1:12:19] father
[1:12:20] in the name of jesus
[1:12:22] we want to say thank you for your
[1:12:24] blessings to us
[1:12:27] that you have brought us to this day
[1:12:31] lord as we
[1:12:33] held andrew in our arms some years ago
[1:12:36] and dedicate him to you
[1:12:38] we didn't know we would be abiding time
[1:12:42] lord to where that we would be
[1:12:44] here at this moment
[1:12:46] announcing an engagement
[1:12:49] planned marriage
[1:12:51] but lord
[1:12:52] you brought us to this day and it's for
[1:12:54] a purpose and a plan
[1:12:56] and we want to thank you lord that we're
[1:12:59] living in that plan and walking out the
[1:13:01] vision that you have
[1:13:03] and no doubt in the mind of god
[1:13:07] back in the before the time would begin
[1:13:11] in the ages
[1:13:14] known only to god and the angels
[1:13:16] you had in your mind
[1:13:20] this very moment
[1:13:22] this young couple coming together to
[1:13:24] pledge
[1:13:26] their engagement to be married
[1:13:29] lord it's a sacred thing a sacred thing
[1:13:33] the world will use this now and say oh
[1:13:35] my fiancee and they're just shacking
[1:13:37] together
[1:13:38] but lord to us it's a holy thing
[1:13:41] and it's a promise that they've made to
[1:13:43] one another
[1:13:44] [Music]
[1:13:45] but i pray lord that they'll keep this
[1:13:47] engagement holy and
[1:13:50] lord
[1:13:51] it's so easy at these moments to let
[1:13:53] feelings get out of out of touch
[1:13:57] but lord i pray that you'll just keep
[1:13:59] them to yourself lord and keep them pure
[1:14:02] and holy
[1:14:03] so that they can be a righteous example
[1:14:06] of jesus christ
[1:14:08] lord like we witness moriah
[1:14:11] and western
[1:14:13] with their first kiss at the altar
[1:14:16] you've taught us to keep these things
[1:14:17] holy
[1:14:19] lord to keep it sacred
[1:14:21] and i pray lord that we'll do the same
[1:14:23] father in these moments

[1:14:30] that reflect your great glory

[1:14:39] trophies of the grace of god i pray in
[1:14:43] the name of jesus bless them
[1:14:45] with your holy spirit and bless their
[1:14:48] plans and their upcoming marriage

[1:14:53] now in jesus name amen
[1:14:57] bind us
[1:15:00] together
[1:15:01] lord blind us
[1:15:04] together
[1:15:06] with chords
[1:15:08] that cannot
[1:15:10] be broken
[1:15:14] bind us
[1:15:16] together
[1:15:19] bind us
[1:15:21] together
[1:15:23] behind us
[1:15:25] together
[1:15:27] with love
[1:15:29] amen amen thank you
[1:15:32] can you stand together with me as we
[1:15:34] turn to the book of genesis chapter 18.
[1:15:38] and we're going to look at the prophecy
[1:15:40] of abraham
[1:15:42] that spoke
[1:15:43] of this end time and end time plans of
[1:15:46] god and
[1:15:48] and
[1:15:50] so let us just look at this today
[1:15:53] as we prayerfully ask god to minister to
[1:15:56] us through the word genesis 18 verse 1
[1:15:59] and the lord appeared unto him in the
[1:16:02] plains of mamrie and he sat in the tent
[1:16:04] door in the heat of the day
[1:16:07] and he lifted his eyes and looked and
[1:16:09] low three men stood by him
[1:16:11] and when he saw them he ran to meet them
[1:16:14] from the tent door and bowed himself to
[1:16:17] the toward the ground and said my lord
[1:16:20] if now i have found favor in thy sight
[1:16:24] pass not away
[1:16:25] i pray thee from thy servant
[1:16:28] then i'd like to turn to
[1:16:31] the gospel of saint luke chapter 17.
[1:16:34] we'll read there from verse 26
[1:16:38] luke chapter 17 verse 26 and as it was
[1:16:42] in the days of noah so shall it also be
[1:16:46] in the days of the son of man
[1:16:49] they did eat they drank they married
[1:16:51] wives they were given in marriage until
[1:16:52] the day that noah entered into the ark
[1:16:55] and the flood came
[1:16:57] and destroyed them all and likewise also
[1:17:02] as it was in the days of lot they did
[1:17:04] eat they drank they bought the soul they
[1:17:06] planted they lo they build it
[1:17:09] but the same day that lot went out of
[1:17:12] sodomite rain fire and brimstone from
[1:17:15] heaven and destroyed them all
[1:17:18] and even thus shall it be in the day
[1:17:21] when the son of man is revealed
[1:17:24] and then i would like you to turn with
[1:17:26] me also to second thessalonians chapter
[1:17:29] 1
[1:17:30] and we will read from verse 4
[1:17:32] 2 thessalonians chapter 1
[1:17:35] and verse 4.
[1:17:38] so that we ourselves glory in you in the
[1:17:41] churches of god for your patience and
[1:17:43] faith and all your persecutions and
[1:17:45] tribulations that you endure
[1:17:48] which is a manifest token
[1:17:50] of the righteous judgment of god that
[1:17:53] you may be counted worthy of the kingdom
[1:17:56] of god for which you suffer
[1:17:58] seeing it is a righteous thing with god
[1:18:00] to recompense tribulation to them that
[1:18:03] trouble you
[1:18:04] and you who are troubled rest with us
[1:18:07] when the lord jesus
[1:18:09] shall be revealed from heaven with his
[1:18:12] mighty angels
[1:18:13] in flaming fire taken vengeance on them
[1:18:16] that know not god and that obey not the
[1:18:19] gospel of our lord jesus christ
[1:18:21] who shall be punished with everlasting
[1:18:24] destruction from the presence of the
[1:18:26] lord and from the glory of his power
[1:18:29] when he shall come
[1:18:31] to be glorified in his saints and to be
[1:18:34] admired in all them that believe because
[1:18:36] our testimony among you was believed
[1:18:39] in that day may god bless you can be
[1:18:42] seated
[1:18:46] but we read some very interesting
[1:18:48] scriptures and
[1:18:50] not only that but prophecies
[1:18:52] of the last day because the bible tells
[1:18:55] us as it was in the days of sodom
[1:18:58] so shall it be when the son of man is
[1:19:01] revealed
[1:19:02] and then we see just before sodom burned
[1:19:05] in genesis chapter 18 and verse
[1:19:08] 1-3 that we read that
[1:19:11] abraham
[1:19:12] received a visitation from the almighty
[1:19:15] god
[1:19:16] and there in this appearing
[1:19:19] here when he looked up and he was
[1:19:21] watching for him to come remember
[1:19:24] he was he was the eyes that was looking
[1:19:26] out the tent representing the church
[1:19:29] because we have had prophetic eyes in
[1:19:32] this day to be able to identify the
[1:19:35] coming of the lord and and the peering
[1:19:37] of christ among us
[1:19:39] and so
[1:19:41] again as he looked there remember he
[1:19:44] could now see another appearing of the
[1:19:47] almighty the god had appeared as as
[1:19:51] elohim and and as revealed himself as
[1:19:55] jehovah and the divine call and then he
[1:19:57] would again once again show himself as
[1:20:01] melchizedek and then come again and and
[1:20:05] identify himself as the almighty god or
[1:20:08] else had i
[1:20:09] but
[1:20:10] regardless of what how many
[1:20:12] manifestations of of god that abraham
[1:20:16] saw he knew always it was the same lord
[1:20:21] so he when he sees
[1:20:24] disappearing he knows even though he
[1:20:26] sees three he knows there is but one
[1:20:30] lord
[1:20:31] and so he i he says my lord if i've now
[1:20:34] found favor in thy sight pass not away i
[1:20:38] pray thee from thy from thy servants so
[1:20:41] it tells us now
[1:20:43] that of course this is god changing his
[1:20:46] mask it's the same god
[1:20:49] all the time he is just changing his
[1:20:52] mask
[1:20:53] now we're going to take this one a step
[1:20:55] further as i spoke on the godhead and
[1:20:57] god changing his mask the last time i
[1:21:00] spoke on this a couple of weeks ago so
[1:21:02] we're going to go we're going to speak
[1:21:04] on the mask and use my dust
[1:21:08] now as we're looking at this luke 17 30
[1:21:12] tells us that as it was in the days of
[1:21:16] lot
[1:21:17] you know god with flaming fire took
[1:21:20] vengeance on the sodomites
[1:21:23] who knew not god and
[1:21:25] and then he said thus he said
[1:21:28] so shall it be when the son of man is
[1:21:32] revealed
[1:21:33] so the son of man we know is the word so
[1:21:36] here in the end time when the word is
[1:21:38] restored or and the son of man christ is
[1:21:42] revealed from heaven with his holy
[1:21:45] angels we know that it's at that time
[1:21:48] the fire is going to fall
[1:21:50] and we're living in the day when of
[1:21:52] course that we're right on the verge of
[1:21:55] the destruction of the earth where that
[1:21:57] the world this time will burn with fire
[1:22:00] remember that just as god takes the the
[1:22:03] um uh
[1:22:05] man through
[1:22:06] through the water the blood and the
[1:22:08] spirit so he did the same thing with the
[1:22:11] earth in redemption of the earth he
[1:22:13] baptized it in water in the days of noah
[1:22:16] and then he
[1:22:17] he shed his blood upon it in the days of
[1:22:20] jesus and then the fire will come upon
[1:22:22] the earth to cleanse it from all sin
[1:22:26] now so you see these these to abraham
[1:22:29] was not multiple deities but it was the
[1:22:32] same god just changing his mask
[1:22:36] now jesus does the same thing when he
[1:22:39] reveals himself in his sonship he will
[1:22:42] come in various different
[1:22:44] administrations
[1:22:46] and in these administration he comes in
[1:22:48] three sons names
[1:22:51] now he comes as son of man that is god
[1:22:54] the god prophet he comes as son of god
[1:22:57] that was him as the holy ghost through
[1:22:59] the seven ages and then he comes as the
[1:23:02] son of david and in the millennium jesus
[1:23:05] will be his with his bride and will
[1:23:08] reign
[1:23:09] with him and he will be the son of david
[1:23:13] so he comes in three sons names that son
[1:23:15] of son of man son of god and then son of
[1:23:19] david now this son of man of course is
[1:23:22] used many times in the old testament
[1:23:25] and and it always is referring to man's
[1:23:28] flesh or the dust
[1:23:31] and god called the prophet ezekiel's son
[1:23:33] of man 93 times
[1:23:36] and this is where it gets so identified
[1:23:39] with the prophetic office
[1:23:41] in this way you see god was actually
[1:23:44] simply calling
[1:23:45] ezekiel a human being it literally means
[1:23:48] son of dust
[1:23:50] man is adam or who came from the dust
[1:23:54] right so when he's saying son of man
[1:23:56] he's saying son of adam or son of dust
[1:23:59] and so it literally means son of dust so
[1:24:03] son of man is an indirect term for human
[1:24:08] god became man or human in jesus christ
[1:24:13] and for he was truly a human being yet
[1:24:16] he was fully man yet he was fully god
[1:24:21] god literally came in the flesh
[1:24:24] his body was a temple for the fullness
[1:24:27] of god for the father to dwell in that
[1:24:31] body
[1:24:32] hence he was called the son so now just
[1:24:35] as god gathered the dust and made a body
[1:24:39] and dwelt in it
[1:24:41] there in the days of abraham think of
[1:24:43] this god came down in human flesh
[1:24:46] he would sit down under the tree he
[1:24:48] would eat a meal with him he would talk
[1:24:50] face to face with abraham as a friend
[1:24:54] are you with me now so in in this to do
[1:24:58] this god gathered dust
[1:25:00] and made a body and stepped in it
[1:25:03] and he came down for just a few hours
[1:25:06] now to visit with abraham and he's
[1:25:09] revealing himself in death
[1:25:12] as son of man
[1:25:14] so he is revealing himself in dust and
[1:25:17] he is he is there explaining to him
[1:25:20] giving him the revelation for the end
[1:25:22] time
[1:25:23] how that sodom would be burned how that
[1:25:26] there would be a people called out
[1:25:28] amen that would be saved
[1:25:30] a matter how there would be an abraham's
[1:25:33] group that would not be a part of sodom
[1:25:35] and they would receive the promised son
[1:25:38] in order to do that their bodies would
[1:25:40] be changed
[1:25:41] and so all of these things were fitting
[1:25:44] in the prophecy as god was using abraham
[1:25:47] to prophesy of end time events
[1:25:51] now so just as god gathered us in the
[1:25:54] days of abraham maim a body and dwelt in
[1:25:58] it even so the dust of the man called
[1:26:02] jesus
[1:26:03] was made for the purpose of god so that
[1:26:07] he could become flesh for redemption
[1:26:11] now so while jesus was here he he he
[1:26:15] seldom referred himself as son of god
[1:26:17] only five times in john's gospel
[1:26:20] throughout the bible did jesus refer to
[1:26:22] himself others did refer to him devils
[1:26:25] referred to him as son of god
[1:26:27] you know see our our pilate would ask
[1:26:29] are you the son of god all of these
[1:26:31] other but jesus only referred himself
[1:26:34] five times as son of god
[1:26:36] but he refers himself as son of man 88
[1:26:40] times in the new testament
[1:26:43] son of man would be the primary title
[1:26:46] that jesus used
[1:26:48] when he referred to himself
[1:26:51] now and of course this this is because
[1:26:54] son of god speaks of the holy spirit for
[1:26:57] god is a spirit
[1:26:59] and to be son of god is the spirit that
[1:27:02] came out of him
[1:27:04] but son of man in contrast it focuses on
[1:27:07] the humanity of jesus christ and his
[1:27:10] work as the god prophet the seer
[1:27:14] so here he would come in a in a
[1:27:17] visitation of god coming down and this
[1:27:20] time not just not just coming down for a
[1:27:23] few minutes and or a few hours and
[1:27:26] sitting there to uh under an oak tree
[1:27:28] but now god would come and tabernacle
[1:27:31] with man
[1:27:32] amen he would he would he would come as
[1:27:35] a baby god gathered again the dust for
[1:27:39] god to come and live in
[1:27:42] and then that baby would come on up and
[1:27:44] there he would reach this point in his
[1:27:47] ministry just before that he would go
[1:27:50] into his ministry he would be baptized
[1:27:52] with the holy ghost and the father would
[1:27:55] come and dwell in him
[1:27:57] heaven and earth there would be united
[1:27:59] together and reconciled together
[1:28:02] because man and god had been separated
[1:28:05] because of sin but in the man christ
[1:28:08] jesus now heaven and earth comes
[1:28:11] together
[1:28:12] again
[1:28:13] this time for the purpose of redemption
[1:28:17] amen so that he could start a new race
[1:28:22] amen that he could start a new race in
[1:28:25] which he would use other dust
[1:28:28] to give praise to his name
[1:28:30] [Applause]
[1:28:31] now
[1:28:32] so again
[1:28:33] just before the before the fire falls as
[1:28:36] it was in the days of sodom so shall it
[1:28:39] be in the day when the son of man is
[1:28:42] revealed now who is the son of man he is
[1:28:46] the word that's who jesus was he was the
[1:28:48] word made flesh
[1:28:51] amen so even thus shall it be when the
[1:28:53] word that is revealed and it would be
[1:28:56] revealed where in human flesh
[1:29:00] amen so now again just as he appearing
[1:29:04] to abraham was the fullness of all his
[1:29:07] previous revelations oh my he had
[1:29:10] received a divine call came out of the
[1:29:13] earth the chaldeans he had received the
[1:29:16] blood offering and and taught how to
[1:29:18] worship and then he would meet the el
[1:29:21] shaddai and all all of these great
[1:29:24] experiences and previous revelations
[1:29:27] was was wonderful but now here was the
[1:29:30] fullness of it
[1:29:32] and in the fullness of it it would would
[1:29:35] be revealed and that's exactly what
[1:29:37] happened with christ there had been many
[1:29:40] appearings of god he appeared in moses
[1:29:43] he would appear in the in joshua he
[1:29:46] would appear down to the ages and he
[1:29:48] would use men he would anoint that dust
[1:29:51] because he couldn't dwell in that dust
[1:29:53] because the blood had not been shed for
[1:29:56] god to dwell in man
[1:29:58] but once but notice he would come and he
[1:30:01] would anoint us to speak his word
[1:30:04] you think you think of this moses dust
[1:30:08] calling using the word of god calling
[1:30:11] out of dust
[1:30:14] creating out of dust flies fleas plagues
[1:30:18] everything else coming because a man was
[1:30:21] so anointed
[1:30:23] his dust became so anointed with god
[1:30:26] until god used the lips of dust
[1:30:31] now this same thing happens in the end
[1:30:34] time
[1:30:35] because again the fullness as it was in
[1:30:39] christ
[1:30:40] becomes now to where we are not in a
[1:30:43] partial revealing of christ
[1:30:46] we are now in the fullness
[1:30:49] of the revealing of christ
[1:30:52] you talk about revival friends there's
[1:30:54] been revivals before but this is not
[1:30:56] just another revival
[1:30:58] this is the fullness of all of the
[1:31:00] revivals
[1:31:02] amen god pouring out his spirit
[1:31:05] so you see the same thing happens as god
[1:31:08] reveals himself the word is revealed the
[1:31:11] mysteries are made known the word
[1:31:13] becomes flesh
[1:31:14] but this time in bright form
[1:31:17] and then that dust becomes glorified
[1:31:21] you can look at your dust this morning
[1:31:24] and you can know that it's going to be
[1:31:27] glorified
[1:31:28] [Applause]
[1:31:30] and then once it's glorified it's going
[1:31:32] to be translated
[1:31:35] amen it'll appear and then it'll
[1:31:37] disappear
[1:31:39] amen so you see the word the word
[1:31:42] becomes flesh in the bright form and the
[1:31:46] and he will be glorified in his saints
[1:31:51] in the same day that is revealed from
[1:31:54] heaven with his mighty angels
[1:32:00] now the revealing of the son of man
[1:32:03] that's christ is god
[1:32:05] god would do that he would reveal the
[1:32:08] son of man
[1:32:09] and it would be a prophet or a son of
[1:32:12] man to reveal the son of man
[1:32:16] and the son of man christ was revealed
[1:32:18] then through a prophet but the revealing
[1:32:21] of the son of man is much more than
[1:32:24] that this is where our mistake has been
[1:32:28] we're we've been able to see the prophet
[1:32:31] and the prophetic office
[1:32:33] but i want to i want to get bring that a
[1:32:36] step further and realize the son of man
[1:32:39] is still being revealed
[1:32:40] [Music]
[1:32:42] amen the christ is now still being
[1:32:44] revealed in dust
[1:32:47] amen now here in this end time before
[1:32:50] the fire fall god's appeared now now his
[1:32:53] appearance not his coming he's coming
[1:32:55] we'll meet him in the air but god
[1:32:57] appears and where he's appearing is in
[1:32:59] bright form
[1:33:02] amen now in his bride that just like in
[1:33:06] abraham's camp there was a seer
[1:33:09] abraham was a prophet
[1:33:12] amen he was the eyes of the body
[1:33:14] and the seer catches the revelation from
[1:33:17] god and reveals a mystery to the bride
[1:33:20] body and the bride has eyes to see and
[1:33:24] ears to hear what the spirit is saying
[1:33:26] because there is a prophet a seer in the
[1:33:30] midst
[1:33:31] i want you to understand you see things
[1:33:34] today that you had never seen except to
[1:33:36] the eyes of that eagle
[1:33:38] [Applause]
[1:33:40] amen except for a prophetic anointing
[1:33:43] and a prophetic office
[1:33:45] unless it changed from reformer
[1:33:49] to profit
[1:33:50] because we've had reformers down to the
[1:33:52] ages but in this day it changes from
[1:33:55] reformer because god's not reforming a
[1:33:58] church
[1:33:59] to prophet because god's stepping into a
[1:34:02] church
[1:34:04] amen so the appearing of the lord
[1:34:06] abraham it would confirm to him the
[1:34:08] coming of the soon coming of the son
[1:34:12] isaac the promised son it would show him
[1:34:14] the salvation of lot the church it would
[1:34:17] show him the destruction of sodom in the
[1:34:20] appearance of jehovah to abraham was the
[1:34:24] revealing of the mysteries
[1:34:28] remember he's not just
[1:34:30] coming he's not just appearing just to
[1:34:34] show up
[1:34:35] he's doing something
[1:34:38] he's bringing a faith to turn our hearts
[1:34:42] toward the revelation
[1:34:45] toward the coming of the promised son
[1:34:47] toward the preparation before the
[1:34:50] firefalls
[1:34:51] come on somebody
[1:34:53] now it's been the dispensation
[1:34:55] of the son of god the holy spirit down
[1:34:58] through the church ages and and that was
[1:35:00] because it was giving portions of his
[1:35:04] spirit
[1:35:05] there would be a portion given of
[1:35:06] justification that was a holy ghost to
[1:35:09] luther and then there would be a greater
[1:35:11] portion of sanctification and gifts of
[1:35:14] the spirit but then in the last day the
[1:35:18] dispensation changes
[1:35:21] amen with the fullness of that same
[1:35:24] spirit
[1:35:26] with power with demonstration and with
[1:35:30] revelation
[1:35:33] now the same holy spirit reveals himself
[1:35:35] in the final outpouring of the spirit
[1:35:38] before the promised son comes
[1:35:41] in the dispensation of the son of man
[1:35:44] christ
[1:35:45] is revealed not just to his bride
[1:35:48] but in his bride
[1:35:50] [Music]
[1:35:51] amen now the revealing of the son of man
[1:35:54] i want to get this to you the revealing
[1:35:56] of the son of man is not the revealing
[1:35:58] of brother branham
[1:36:01] it is the revealing of the word
[1:36:04] the word coming to a prophet
[1:36:08] amen the man who held the office of the
[1:36:10] prophet is gone but i want to declare to
[1:36:13] you the prophet is still here
[1:36:18] oh don't let that go over your head now
[1:36:21] amen you know i want to say it again the
[1:36:23] man who held the office of a prophet
[1:36:26] amen it's gone
[1:36:28] god took him home been gone for nearly
[1:36:30] 60 years
[1:36:32] but the prophet
[1:36:35] is still here
[1:36:39] the son of man is the same holy spirit
[1:36:43] that worked down to the ages
[1:36:46] but now with the prophetic
[1:36:48] administration
[1:36:51] same holy ghost that was in luther
[1:36:54] wesley azuza street but now here in the
[1:36:58] fullness
[1:36:59] with a prophetic
[1:37:00] administration
[1:37:03] and as long as the holy ghost is here
[1:37:07] the prophet
[1:37:08] is still here
[1:37:13] amen
[1:37:14] now the way of a true prophet brother
[1:37:16] branham said this heavenly father speak
[1:37:18] again roar
[1:37:19] forth lord with the holy ghost he is the
[1:37:23] prophet of the hour
[1:37:24] he is the prophet of the day trying to
[1:37:27] find his way into the hearts of men and
[1:37:30] women that he could speak truth and i'm
[1:37:33] sure i'm so glad he's finding some
[1:37:36] aren't you glad he found you
[1:37:38] amen but you see the holy spirit he said
[1:37:41] is the prophet of today
[1:37:44] and he's trying to find his way in the
[1:37:46] hearts of men and women
[1:37:48] that he could speak truth and then again
[1:37:51] he tells us an investment he said jesus
[1:37:53] said in these days he which is a
[1:37:55] personal pronoun he the holy ghost when
[1:37:58] he has come upon you come to you he will
[1:38:01] show you these things
[1:38:02] that i have taught you and will show you
[1:38:04] things to come remains the same thing
[1:38:06] the holy spirit is the prophet among us
[1:38:10] today the holy spirit is the prophet
[1:38:17] anointed one's in the end time the holy
[1:38:19] spirit is the prophet of this hour
[1:38:22] he is vindicating his word proving it
[1:38:26] now of course when brother branham was
[1:38:28] here he held the office of the seventh
[1:38:31] angel
[1:38:32] and as malachi 4 the elijah prophet
[1:38:36] he was definitely in the office of a
[1:38:38] prophet
[1:38:40] but i want you to know that was never
[1:38:41] his revelations
[1:38:43] [Applause]
[1:38:46] that was never his mystery truce
[1:38:49] that was never from the mind of a man
[1:38:52] that was the mind of almighty god
[1:38:55] speaking through a man
[1:38:57] god used his guest
[1:39:01] to be able for us to identify
[1:39:04] god's appearing in this last day
[1:39:08] now so he the holy spirit is the prophet
[1:39:12] of the hour and i just want to declare
[1:39:14] to you again the prophet is still here
[1:39:18] and man he is the holy ghost and his son
[1:39:21] of man he is still
[1:39:24] using flesh to appear in
[1:39:29] now the mysteries of god are revealed
[1:39:33] only
[1:39:34] to a prophetic class of people
[1:39:39] i want you to understand something
[1:39:41] our book
[1:39:42] is the closing book of the bible
[1:39:45] that was specifically to us
[1:39:50] nobody else would understand the
[1:39:52] messages to to ephesus myrna who their
[1:39:55] messengers was and all the way down to
[1:39:57] the end of the church ages
[1:39:59] nobody else would understand the mystery
[1:40:02] of the seven seals
[1:40:04] it was something that was hid
[1:40:07] and the book was closed
[1:40:10] somebody with me
[1:40:12] amen so again
[1:40:14] this is why the book of revelation is
[1:40:17] the bride's book
[1:40:20] and why the understanding
[1:40:22] comes only to her
[1:40:26] i know that sounds exclusive but jesus
[1:40:29] made it pretty exclusive
[1:40:31] he said it's given to her to know the
[1:40:33] mysteries of the kingdom
[1:40:35] jesus said this is why i speak in
[1:40:38] parables this is why he
[1:40:41] made a parabolic book the book of
[1:40:43] revelation
[1:40:45] it would be symbolic
[1:40:47] it would be in parables it would not be
[1:40:50] understood
[1:40:52] until the days of the voice of the
[1:40:54] seventh angel when he should begin to
[1:40:57] sound to the last church age
[1:41:00] amen and then and then then he would he
[1:41:04] he would make it known but until then
[1:41:06] it's just parables
[1:41:08] it's everybody's guess
[1:41:10] that's why we got hundreds of books
[1:41:11] written on the book of revelation and
[1:41:13] every one of them are different
[1:41:15] because why it was god used symbols
[1:41:18] because it wasn't given for everybody to
[1:41:21] know
[1:41:23] god reserved it to an end-time people
[1:41:28] i want you to understand you are a
[1:41:29] special elected group of people
[1:41:34] where god is doing something more than
[1:41:36] what he's done in previous ages for in
[1:41:39] this age is the fullness of god made
[1:41:43] known amen
[1:41:47] where others partly had him
[1:41:50] partly understood him
[1:41:51] partly revealed
[1:41:53] now in the evening time it shall be
[1:41:56] light
[1:41:57] light will shine on scripture that has
[1:41:59] never shown them before
[1:42:01] things that were kept
[1:42:04] kept and made silence don't reveal it
[1:42:07] it'll be made known in the days of the
[1:42:09] seventh angel
[1:42:10] you realize if brother branham did not
[1:42:13] reveal the seven thunders that he could
[1:42:15] not be the the messengers of of
[1:42:17] revelation 10 7.
[1:42:20] come on somebody
[1:42:21] if that was not revealed to him he was
[1:42:24] not the messenger
[1:42:26] amen now then if it's not made known to
[1:42:29] you the right people you're not the
[1:42:31] bride
[1:42:32] [Applause]
[1:42:33] think about it it's your
[1:42:36] mystery it's your revelation
[1:42:39] it's your truth that is given to bring a
[1:42:43] change to your body
[1:42:49] hallelujah
[1:42:51] amen
[1:42:52] so the mysteries of god are revealed to
[1:42:55] a prophetic class
[1:42:59] i'm talking about the bride now she's
[1:43:01] not just any class she's a prophetic
[1:43:03] class
[1:43:04] she's not a justified class or
[1:43:06] sanctified class or gift class she is
[1:43:10] what
[1:43:11] she is wherever
[1:43:14] mystery has been made known to her she's
[1:43:17] a prophetic class
[1:43:22] let's go to matthew chapter 13 verse 10.
[1:43:25] and the disciples said in him why
[1:43:27] speaketh thou to them in parables
[1:43:30] now this is why he said
[1:43:32] why did you why didn't you just write
[1:43:33] this you know why didn't god take the
[1:43:35] book of revelation and say now look i'm
[1:43:38] going to explain this here uh ephesus
[1:43:42] that's a city
[1:43:43] in asia and smyrna but they're all
[1:43:46] representation of ages that will come
[1:43:50] and there's going to be 2 000 years
[1:43:53] between my coming and my return and
[1:43:56] you're going to go through seven church
[1:43:58] ages
[1:44:00] and at the end of those ages i'm going
[1:44:03] to come back
[1:44:04] why didn't god just show out the whole
[1:44:06] plan
[1:44:07] because satan had done a lot of damage
[1:44:09] with it
[1:44:11] you see if he had showed back then that
[1:44:14] it would be 2 000 years
[1:44:16] then what if what the church would have
[1:44:18] been relaxed
[1:44:19] lethargic
[1:44:21] oh well you know we might as well just
[1:44:23] tarry till it comes just just think of
[1:44:26] what the effect that it's made on you as
[1:44:29] you have carried for a while
[1:44:33] and how the emphasis is changing from
[1:44:35] from
[1:44:36] um waiting or looking and with
[1:44:39] expectation for his coming to waiting
[1:44:42] for his coming
[1:44:44] what happens in the wake
[1:44:48] people lose faith
[1:44:51] they get distracted
[1:44:53] they look at other things come on
[1:44:55] somebody
[1:44:56] amen so again satan would have done
[1:44:58] great damage with it so when he wrote
[1:45:01] our book
[1:45:03] he wrote it in mysteries
[1:45:07] and these mysteries could not be
[1:45:10] revealed until a prophetic class came
[1:45:14] who can understand
[1:45:16] them
[1:45:20] and in that day the son of man the word
[1:45:24] would be revealed
[1:45:25] [Music]
[1:45:28] now so he said why do you speak to them
[1:45:31] in parables he said unto them because it
[1:45:33] is given to you
[1:45:35] to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[1:45:37] heaven but to them is not given
[1:45:44] so now i want you to get to stop just a
[1:45:46] minute
[1:45:48] it's not given to everybody and even in
[1:45:50] that day it wasn't given to everybody it
[1:45:52] was abraham and his group
[1:45:55] abraham and sarah their 300 or whatever
[1:45:57] it was you know that little group
[1:46:00] received the revelation
[1:46:03] we're going to get a body change we're
[1:46:05] going to have a promised son
[1:46:07] amen sodom's going to burn
[1:46:10] lot's going to be called out
[1:46:13] the mysteries would be revealed to what
[1:46:15] a little group
[1:46:19] you know why because they were the
[1:46:21] friend of god
[1:46:26] not a friend of the world
[1:46:29] a friend of god
[1:46:31] listen just for a moment
[1:46:33] john 15 15
[1:46:36] jesus even said from now on or
[1:46:38] henceforth i call you not servants
[1:46:41] we're not just slaves of a church
[1:46:44] we're not bondswomen
[1:46:47] i call you not servants for the servant
[1:46:50] knoweth not what this lord doeth
[1:46:53] but i have called you friends
[1:46:57] here's the definition of friend for all
[1:46:59] things i've heard of my father i've made
[1:47:01] known unto you
[1:47:05] and if you look in james chapter 2 verse
[1:47:07] 23 and the scripture was fulfilled which
[1:47:10] said that abraham believed god it was
[1:47:11] imputed
[1:47:13] unto him for righteousness and he for
[1:47:15] and he was called the friend of god
[1:47:20] so i want you to get it he's not
[1:47:23] revealing himself to everybody this is
[1:47:26] an unveiling of god but he's not
[1:47:27] unveiling himself to everybody
[1:47:30] he's unveiling himself to his friends
[1:47:36] amen
[1:47:38] now in the appearing of the lord to
[1:47:40] abraham he had come to reveal the
[1:47:43] mysteries of the end time plan now not
[1:47:46] only was he revealing the end of sodom
[1:47:48] and the end of sarah's baroness and the
[1:47:51] coming son but he was actually using
[1:47:53] that to prophesy
[1:47:56] of the end time
[1:47:59] now
[1:48:01] and he does this
[1:48:03] friend
[1:48:04] to friend
[1:48:08] he comes down and sits with abraham
[1:48:11] under the oak tree
[1:48:12] as a friend
[1:48:14] he reveals things to abraham as a friend
[1:48:18] seeing you're going to inherit all
[1:48:20] things seeing that you're going to be a
[1:48:22] great nation seeing who you are i'm
[1:48:25] going to show you what i'm going to do
[1:48:30] now if you think of this in christ the
[1:48:32] mystery brother brandon said god's great
[1:48:35] mystery what the eternal god had as a
[1:48:38] mystery has now been unfolded in jesus
[1:48:40] christ and then given right down to his
[1:48:43] church what was once in god's mind
[1:48:47] is now in the body of christ
[1:48:50] jesus making love to the church his
[1:48:53] bride whispering secrets to her
[1:48:58] you know how you tell your wife things
[1:49:01] you know the little girl you're going to
[1:49:02] marry you love her so much you just tell
[1:49:05] her the secrets and you get her up next
[1:49:07] to you and love and everything you know
[1:49:09] how it is that's what christ
[1:49:12] god christ is doing to the church he's
[1:49:15] letting her know the secrets
[1:49:18] not these flirters he says i mean his
[1:49:21] wife
[1:49:23] amen now but how by having the
[1:49:26] revelation of his secret made known to
[1:49:28] him by his grace
[1:49:31] i want you to know that's grace that's
[1:49:33] been imparted to you
[1:49:35] that's the mercies of god being imparted
[1:49:38] to you
[1:49:39] amen so what what is it now why won't
[1:49:41] the word outside them receive it because
[1:49:43] they got ears and they wanted he came
[1:49:45] here and they got eyes but they didn't
[1:49:46] see
[1:49:47] because they set him up
[1:49:52] amen isaiah said they couldn't see
[1:49:57] the last church they said they would be
[1:49:59] blind
[1:50:04] now
[1:50:05] let's go to isaiah 29 and verse 10.
[1:50:08] let's just look at this in this bible
[1:50:10] prophecy for the lord had poured out
[1:50:13] upon you the spirit of of deep sleep and
[1:50:16] as close your eyes the prophets and your
[1:50:19] rulers the seers has he covered
[1:50:24] so here is the darkness comes god allows
[1:50:28] the darkness in this end time
[1:50:30] and it will close it'll be a spirit of
[1:50:34] deep sleep upon the people
[1:50:38] and i tell you
[1:50:40] it was the same with you
[1:50:43] just like it was with zachariah
[1:50:46] somebody help me preach now in the book
[1:50:48] of zechariah what was it there were
[1:50:51] things that was already there
[1:50:53] but it took an awakening of an angel
[1:50:58] and when he was he said he awakened me
[1:51:00] as a man is awakened out of his sleep
[1:51:04] that's what god did in this day he sent
[1:51:07] a message to you who was sleeping just
[1:51:09] like the foolish was sleeping
[1:51:12] but god wouldn't let you sleep on come
[1:51:15] on
[1:51:16] there was a midnight cry that said
[1:51:18] behold the bridegroom cometh go you out
[1:51:21] to meet him
[1:51:23] and it stirred you from your slumber
[1:51:25] [Applause]
[1:51:28] hallelujah when zachariah's eyes was
[1:51:32] open he said and i saw seven golden
[1:51:34] candlesticks and he said i saw them all
[1:51:37] feeding from olive trees a direct fly a
[1:51:40] direct line from the olive trees itself
[1:51:44] amen never runs out amen the fire never
[1:51:49] goes out
[1:51:50] the supply is unlimited
[1:51:52] the supply will never end are you with
[1:51:55] me
[1:51:56] hallelujah why it's an unlimited supply
[1:52:00] and he said i'm telling you the supply
[1:52:03] of the oil the holy spirit is unlimited
[1:52:07] it'll do beyond what you can think or
[1:52:10] ask
[1:52:11] it'll cause your body to change and
[1:52:13] great hair go back the right color and
[1:52:16] the wrinkles will fall off your face and
[1:52:18] you'll be changed in a moment in a
[1:52:20] twinkling of an eye
[1:52:23] [Applause]
[1:52:28] but he said the lord has poured out upon
[1:52:31] you the spirit of deep sleep
[1:52:34] close your eyes
[1:52:36] the prophets and your rulers the seers
[1:52:38] has he covered
[1:52:40] this is a condition
[1:52:42] people are trying to understand what's
[1:52:45] happening
[1:52:46] what's happening over here
[1:52:48] in ukraine and why is russia doing that
[1:52:51] and they can't they can't see the
[1:52:53] movement of of rome and what's going on
[1:52:56] here in the condition of the church
[1:53:02] why is it they're seers he have covered
[1:53:05] they're prophets and rulers
[1:53:07] he have covered his closer eyes he's
[1:53:09] allowed a spirit of darkness
[1:53:13] to come out in this last day
[1:53:16] as he gave in revelation 9 said i saw a
[1:53:19] star fall from heaven
[1:53:21] and the hymn was given the key to the
[1:53:23] bottomless pit
[1:53:24] and out of there there was smoke that
[1:53:26] rose out of the bottomless pit
[1:53:28] somebody with me and that because
[1:53:30] they're blinding delusion and the last
[1:53:32] day there is not not just a few people
[1:53:35] following the prophet
[1:53:38] that's going to be deceived the whole
[1:53:39] world
[1:53:41] is going to be the seed
[1:53:43] the bible said every person whose name
[1:53:46] is not on the lamb's book of life
[1:53:50] will be deceived
[1:53:52] [Applause]
[1:53:54] so we're talking about a whole cell
[1:53:57] deception
[1:54:00] even the crowning of satan after the
[1:54:02] bridegroom will be looked on as a good
[1:54:04] thing
[1:54:08] they will actually invite satan
[1:54:11] to have rule over them
[1:54:17] for the lord has poured out upon you the
[1:54:19] spirit of deep sleep
[1:54:21] and close your eyes the prophets
[1:54:24] and your rulers and the seers has it
[1:54:26] covered look what happened down in sodom
[1:54:28] what happened they went bond
[1:54:32] the preaching of the word brother
[1:54:34] branham said
[1:54:35] caused them to go blind
[1:54:39] and the preaching of easy believism
[1:54:42] has put so many to sleep
[1:54:45] [Music]
[1:54:47] but you're not of that
[1:54:50] amen you you are you are there where
[1:54:53] there is a prophetic class of people
[1:54:56] with eyes that can see and ears that
[1:54:59] hear what the spirit is saying to the
[1:55:01] church
[1:55:03] look at verse 11 and the vision
[1:55:06] of all has become to you
[1:55:09] as the words of a book that is sealed
[1:55:14] which men delivered to one that has
[1:55:16] learned somebody that is educated come
[1:55:19] from the seminaries and says read this i
[1:55:22] pray thee and he says i cannot it's
[1:55:25] sealed
[1:55:30] and the book is delivered to him that is
[1:55:32] not learned saying read this i prayed
[1:55:34] and he says
[1:55:36] i'm not learned
[1:55:39] i don't know what this means
[1:55:42] i don't understand what this book is
[1:55:44] saying i don't see i don't see any thing
[1:55:49] i mean you know men said uh john had a
[1:55:52] nightmare
[1:55:54] or he ate something that night it just
[1:55:56] made him made him sick and he had
[1:55:58] illusions we can't understand it
[1:56:02] and to learn it those from a seminary so
[1:56:05] well hey we can't read this we're not
[1:56:07] sure about what it says
[1:56:10] because you know we just don't know
[1:56:12] we're learning we're in the seminaries
[1:56:15] but even we don't understand it
[1:56:19] and those that that are not in the
[1:56:21] seminary that has not learned said i
[1:56:23] can't do it i've never been to seminary
[1:56:25] i have no clue what's in this book
[1:56:29] but it's the bride's book
[1:56:33] and it's given to somebody
[1:56:36] god didn't put it in the bible just for
[1:56:38] it to occupy a little space at the end
[1:56:41] of the bible
[1:56:43] he did it for the end time people
[1:56:46] where there would be an appearance of
[1:56:48] god and his fullness poured out
[1:56:50] and the son of man would be revealed
[1:56:57] so he says wherefore the lord said for
[1:57:00] as much as this people draw near me with
[1:57:02] their mouth their lips do honor me but
[1:57:05] they have removed their heart far from
[1:57:06] me and their fear taught to toward me
[1:57:10] and their fear toward me is taught by
[1:57:12] the precept but man this this is what he
[1:57:14] said here they got ears but they're not
[1:57:16] here they can't they don't have the
[1:57:18] ability here they're not they're not of
[1:57:21] a prophetic class not
[1:57:37] of available who would burn
[1:57:39] he could not see the destruction that
[1:57:41] was going on
[1:57:43] he cannot see the sin that would so
[1:57:45] contaminate his family
[1:57:48] until his daughter's there without have
[1:57:50] this wild idea after it's all over and
[1:57:53] they're saved out of it to have children
[1:57:55] by him
[1:57:56] you know they he could not see it going
[1:57:59] that direction
[1:58:03] but aren't you glad today you can see
[1:58:05] what direction the world is going
[1:58:08] and you don't have to look at cnn or fox
[1:58:10] news to know it
[1:58:13] some of you are worried about looking at
[1:58:14] the news and keeping up with the news
[1:58:16] keep up with the news
[1:58:20] look right into this book
[1:58:22] it tells you who you are where you're
[1:58:25] from and where you're going
[1:58:33] now so brother branham tells us he said
[1:58:36] the book of revelation has more symbols
[1:58:39] than all the rest of the books of the
[1:58:40] bible more symbols because it's a book
[1:58:43] of prophecy
[1:58:44] and you know if it's a book of prophecy
[1:58:46] then it takes a prophet to reveal it
[1:58:50] it is a prophetic book therefore it's
[1:58:52] not un it has to be understood by a
[1:58:54] prophetic class
[1:58:57] this book is not meant for everybody
[1:59:00] there's nobody can understand it hardly
[1:59:03] the book is made for a certain class of
[1:59:05] people
[1:59:07] look at look at them
[1:59:09] look at the world today wow the seven
[1:59:12] seals we don't know what they are
[1:59:13] they're not revealed the seals aren't
[1:59:15] open
[1:59:16] the mysteries are not made known
[1:59:19] as them in any denomination
[1:59:22] are you with me
[1:59:24] amen it's not known it's still a sealed
[1:59:26] book
[1:59:28] but not to you
[1:59:31] the seals have been removed
[1:59:33] and the book is now open to you
[1:59:37] hallelujah and every mystery of god
[1:59:40] pertaining to the bride has been
[1:59:42] revealed to the endtime people
[1:59:44] through an open book
[1:59:47] that's why we preach we are the people
[1:59:49] out the open book not the seal of the
[1:59:52] book but the open book
[1:59:57] so he says this book's not meant for
[1:59:59] everybody there's nobody can understand
[2:00:01] that the book is made for a certain
[2:00:03] class of people
[2:00:04] all and over in deuteronomy he said the
[2:00:06] hidden things belong to the lord that's
[2:00:08] right he reveals him to his children the
[2:00:10] hidden things so if you look in
[2:00:12] deuteronomy 29 29 you'll see where he's
[2:00:15] pulling us from the secret things belong
[2:00:17] to the lord our god
[2:00:21] but those things which are revealed
[2:00:23] belong to us
[2:00:26] and to our children forever
[2:00:28] that we may do the words of the law
[2:00:31] isn't that amazing
[2:00:33] the secret things belong to god
[2:00:35] and he held them in his mind for how
[2:00:37] many years
[2:00:39] until the last day
[2:00:42] and then a disappearing he would come
[2:00:44] and share with his friends
[2:00:48] hallelujah his elect
[2:00:50] also called his bride
[2:00:52] a prophetic class
[2:00:54] he would share with him the mysteries
[2:00:58] and they're no longer mysteries
[2:01:01] that's why i say i hate me to hear
[2:01:03] mystery preachers preach
[2:01:05] because when they get through it's still
[2:01:06] a mystery we don't preach mysteries we
[2:01:09] preach revelation
[2:01:11] [Applause]
[2:01:13] amen
[2:01:14] but jesus said in matthew 11 25 he said
[2:01:18] i thank the o father lord of heaven and
[2:01:21] earth because thou hast hid these things
[2:01:23] from the wise and the prudent and has
[2:01:26] revealed them unto babes
[2:01:30] amen everyone who's been born again had
[2:01:32] to be a baby
[2:01:35] so to the born again is the one he
[2:01:37] reveals them to
[2:01:39] now the carnal mind cannot come back
[2:01:41] come comprehend the great things of the
[2:01:43] scripture it's just foolish to them
[2:01:47] you know but the ones that are the
[2:01:49] lovers of the word
[2:01:51] that's who wrote the book and that
[2:01:53] that's excuse me that's who the book was
[2:01:55] written to to the church those that are
[2:01:58] lovers of the word those that are
[2:01:59] friends of god
[2:02:01] those who say i'm not a bomb slave i'm
[2:02:04] not at the bones woman
[2:02:06] i'm his friend
[2:02:08] and as his friend he reveals all things
[2:02:13] now first corinthians 2 14 but the
[2:02:16] natural man receiving not the things of
[2:02:18] the spirit of god for their foolishness
[2:02:20] unto them neither can he know them
[2:02:23] because they are spiritually discerned
[2:02:26] so the only way you're going to know is
[2:02:27] by the holy ghost
[2:02:29] paul would say in this same thing he
[2:02:31] said they the princes of this world was
[2:02:33] blinded therefore they crucified christ
[2:02:35] because had they known it
[2:02:38] they would have never crucified the lamb
[2:02:40] of glory
[2:02:46] so brother branham tells us in the
[2:02:48] church age book as he starts in on the
[2:02:50] revelation of jesus christ
[2:02:53] he said you remember i mentioned at the
[2:02:55] beginning of this message that this book
[2:02:57] we're studying is actual revelation of
[2:02:59] jesus himself in the church and his work
[2:03:02] in the future ages then i mentioned it
[2:03:04] it takes the holy spirit
[2:03:06] to give us revelation or we fail to get
[2:03:08] it bringing these thoughts together you
[2:03:10] see
[2:03:11] you will see it won't take just ordinary
[2:03:13] study and thinking to make this book
[2:03:16] real is going to take the operation of
[2:03:18] the holy ghost
[2:03:20] that means that this book can't be
[2:03:22] revealed to anyone but a special class
[2:03:25] of people
[2:03:26] it will take one with prophetic insight
[2:03:30] it will require the ability to hear from
[2:03:33] god it will require supernatural
[2:03:36] instruction not just a
[2:03:38] student comparing verse with verse so
[2:03:40] that's good but a mystery requires the
[2:03:43] teaching of the spirit or it never
[2:03:45] becomes clear so how we need to hear
[2:03:48] from god and lay ourselves open and
[2:03:49] become yielded to the spirit to hear and
[2:03:52] to know
[2:03:54] this is why brother branham said we
[2:03:55] ought to call on god for revelation more
[2:03:58] than anything else this is why abraham's
[2:04:01] sitting in the tenth door looking out
[2:04:03] watching for the appearing
[2:04:08] that's what prophets do
[2:04:14] and i'm talking to
[2:04:16] a prophetic class
[2:04:19] they have an expectation
[2:04:22] oh my we we ought to have a more
[2:04:24] expectation of just being a church
[2:04:27] just occupying the pew
[2:04:29] being a denominational member come on
[2:04:32] somebody we ought to have a greater
[2:04:34] expectation than that we ought to be
[2:04:36] expecting him lord come walk with me as
[2:04:38] a friend and reveal the secrets of your
[2:04:42] heart
[2:04:43] whisper the love secrets to me
[2:04:49] i tell you what if you sit with your
[2:04:51] eyes open you'd get a revealing even in
[2:04:53] this service
[2:04:57] amen if you get and shake off the sleep
[2:05:00] of laodicea you'd get an awakening and
[2:05:03] then you would begin to see things
[2:05:08] now
[2:05:09] the same fullness
[2:05:10] of god would be in dust again
[2:05:14] but this time
[2:05:15] not as one man as it was with jesus
[2:05:19] but in the flesh body of his bride
[2:05:23] i want you to understand
[2:05:25] because the son of man will be revealed
[2:05:27] in human flesh
[2:05:29] not just brother branham
[2:05:32] but in the the bride body the flesh of
[2:05:36] the bride i'm going to share with you
[2:05:38] some things today from that but you see
[2:05:40] in the in the in the the prophecy of
[2:05:43] abraham
[2:05:44] god
[2:05:45] gathered potassium calcium
[2:05:48] and cosmic light and clay and all the
[2:05:50] elements needed to made a body and he
[2:05:53] stepped into it
[2:05:55] are you with me
[2:05:56] now we we too have grown up through the
[2:05:59] ages and god has been gathering elements
[2:06:05] to make a mature bride
[2:06:08] that he's going to step into
[2:06:14] amen he found a little justification
[2:06:16] with luther
[2:06:18] a little sanctification with wesley
[2:06:21] it's like the wheat plant growing up
[2:06:23] from seed to stalk into tassel to shop
[2:06:26] and back to seed again
[2:06:28] you see the fullness of the life comes
[2:06:31] back into the seed
[2:06:33] it's where the fullness of god becomes
[2:06:35] revealed one more time at the end time
[2:06:40] the gospel started out with christ as a
[2:06:42] seed and it must end with the brighter
[2:06:45] christ is the seed
[2:06:46] this is why i keep telling you over and
[2:06:48] over again you know we look for the
[2:06:51] coming of christ but he's got to come in
[2:06:52] pride form
[2:06:54] for there to be a people to meet him in
[2:06:56] the air
[2:06:59] so before he can come there he's got to
[2:07:01] come in you first
[2:07:05] so this is where he's pouring out his
[2:07:07] spirit
[2:07:08] is in a bright people
[2:07:11] now watch him proven his word he said
[2:07:12] you believe we're living in the last
[2:07:14] days the son of man was to be revealed
[2:07:16] or manifested that would be all the word
[2:07:18] gathered up through luther wesley
[2:07:21] baptist all of that the pentecostal
[2:07:23] gathered up into the revelation of what
[2:07:25] has been the seventh sea the seventh
[2:07:28] angel was to open the sixth seal mystery
[2:07:30] it's ought to be gathered up into the
[2:07:32] son of man listen all of this gathered
[2:07:35] up into the word all this gathered up
[2:07:37] into a bride all of this manifesting
[2:07:40] christ
[2:07:41] the son of man his time of fullness has
[2:07:44] come to the fullness of his word to
[2:07:46] manifest the fullness of his body that's
[2:07:49] the word then that was spoken the spoken
[2:07:51] word made manifest by the word and again
[2:07:54] he said
[2:07:55] there is no leaven among you in other
[2:07:58] words it's not a mixed-up message
[2:08:01] it doesn't have creeds of man and dogma
[2:08:04] is a man
[2:08:05] you know why you want it that way
[2:08:07] because leaven there makes it a little
[2:08:10] more platable a little more pleasing
[2:08:13] but god said in my communion it's
[2:08:15] unleavened bread
[2:08:17] there's nothing mixed with it it's this
[2:08:19] pure word
[2:08:22] it may be a little more coarse and a
[2:08:24] little harder to get down
[2:08:26] but it's pure word there's nothing added
[2:08:28] to it nothing taken out of it
[2:08:32] unleavened bread
[2:08:34] are you with me
[2:08:35] amen and he said no leaven among you and
[2:08:38] he said that brings the entire fullness
[2:08:41] of the godhead bodily among you
[2:08:46] no leaven
[2:08:47] nothing mixed in it
[2:08:49] and that brings the fullness of the god
[2:08:50] hit body among you couldn't do it in
[2:08:52] lutheran's age couldn't do it wesley's
[2:08:54] age couldn't do it in pentecost but in
[2:08:56] the day when the son of man will be
[2:08:57] manifested revealed brought back to the
[2:09:00] church to
[2:09:01] brought back the church together with
[2:09:03] the entire deity of god amongst his
[2:09:06] people showing the same visible signs
[2:09:09] manifesting himself like he did at the
[2:09:11] beginning when he was manifested on
[2:09:13] earth in the form of a prophet god glory
[2:09:16] promised by malachi 4 promised by the
[2:09:19] rest of the scriptures
[2:09:21] all it has been promised for the last
[2:09:23] day come on somebody what's he doing
[2:09:26] bringing the entire deity of god all the
[2:09:29] word into one body
[2:09:32] luther had a part wesley had a part
[2:09:36] but this isn't a part
[2:09:38] this is the fullness
[2:09:40] and the fullness of his word comes in
[2:09:42] the fullness of his church and what it
[2:09:45] does there it kind of has the same
[2:09:47] visible signs manifests himself like he
[2:09:50] did at the beginning when he was
[2:09:51] manifested on earth in the form of
[2:09:53] prophet god
[2:09:55] so the same ministry
[2:09:57] of jesus christ repeats
[2:10:02] but this time it won't be the man of
[2:10:04] galilee it'll be you you you you and you
[2:10:07] [Applause]
[2:10:09] and but not individually but together as
[2:10:12] the body of christ
[2:10:14] manifested jesus christ to say yesterday
[2:10:18] today and forever
[2:10:19] [Music]
[2:10:21] that's why we can't deny one word
[2:10:26] amen
[2:10:28] now so when when he says
[2:10:30] he said first to reveal himself in
[2:10:33] christ the fullness of the guarded body
[2:10:35] and to bring that fullness of the
[2:10:37] godhead bodily into a people
[2:10:40] look what god's doing his fullness
[2:10:43] not a portion of the word
[2:10:47] come on church
[2:10:48] let me describe it like this sometimes
[2:10:51] an illustration will help
[2:10:53] but it's kind of like
[2:10:54] ten blind man
[2:10:57] ten blind man trying to
[2:10:59] to describe an elephant
[2:11:02] and each one of they're all blind and
[2:11:04] they're all trying to feel you know and
[2:11:06] find out remember it's the age of
[2:11:08] blindness
[2:11:10] and the understanding is not there
[2:11:12] because you can't see the picture
[2:11:15] someone goes over here and he he he
[2:11:18] feels the the the side of the elephant
[2:11:20] and he said i'll tell you boys what the
[2:11:22] elephant is it's a big uh rough leathery
[2:11:27] uh wall
[2:11:31] another oil gets over there and he's got
[2:11:33] to hold the tail
[2:11:35] and last
[2:11:36] that denomination don't have it
[2:11:40] they ain't got the truth
[2:11:43] i tell you
[2:11:44] i tell you it's a rope
[2:11:48] that's what an elephant is it's a rope
[2:11:50] i've got it right here in my hand i got
[2:11:52] that revelation it's a rope
[2:11:56] and they you know the other one comes
[2:11:58] over here and he reaches over he gets a
[2:12:01] ivy tusk he said you all of you other
[2:12:04] denominations you're crazy
[2:12:06] you don't have any truth at all well an
[2:12:09] elephant is a big it's a hard substance
[2:12:13] with a lung and
[2:12:15] and it's got this slick feel and it ends
[2:12:17] with a point you guys don't know nothing
[2:12:22] you see they're all seen apart
[2:12:26] but without eyes they can't see the hope
[2:12:30] so what god did to you was set and made
[2:12:33] you a prophetic class of people and sent
[2:12:36] you a prophet
[2:12:39] and all that blue sin said in the israel
[2:12:43] you know there is baptism but it's got
[2:12:45] to be in the name of jesus christ and
[2:12:47] there is a trust there is a power of god
[2:12:50] in the church and it is a wall and it is
[2:12:52] this it's all of this tied into one
[2:12:54] message
[2:12:56] and that's what god did for you brought
[2:12:59] the fullness
[2:13:01] of the different appearings
[2:13:03] into one message
[2:13:05] [Music]
[2:13:08] so that you can receive the fullness of
[2:13:11] god
[2:13:16] now
[2:13:18] so god
[2:13:20] expressing jesus christ who was both
[2:13:23] father son and holy ghost the fullness
[2:13:25] of the godhead on a bodily
[2:13:26] body
[2:13:28] now
[2:13:29] the now the complete fullness of the
[2:13:31] godhead bodily dwells in his church the
[2:13:34] preeminence
[2:13:35] all that god was
[2:13:38] just look at what he was
[2:13:43] he poured into christ
[2:13:46] he was the psalms of david the wilson of
[2:13:48] solomon
[2:13:50] come on the prophecies of the prophets
[2:13:53] he was all of them
[2:13:55] joseph would type him out abraham would
[2:13:58] type him out
[2:14:00] all of them and he was the embodiment of
[2:14:03] all of those words the fullness of the
[2:14:05] word in one body
[2:14:08] now what i'm telling you that all that
[2:14:11] god was he poured into christ and all
[2:14:13] that christ was he is poured into the
[2:14:16] church
[2:14:18] the believers
[2:14:20] so all the appearings of god in the past
[2:14:23] are now made manifest in one body
[2:14:26] called the bride
[2:14:30] because he's a prophetic class
[2:14:34] because the prophet is here
[2:14:36] the eyes
[2:14:39] now he said in christ it revealed his
[2:14:41] own word see down to the age we start
[2:14:43] out from the foundation when the first
[2:14:45] church age when the seed went into the
[2:14:47] ground the complete sea then it went out
[2:14:49] to the feet and luther come out to
[2:14:51] wesley and then to pentecostal the
[2:14:53] tongues in the lips and now it's in the
[2:14:57] eyes
[2:14:58] the prophetic
[2:14:59] malachi 4.
[2:15:04] malachi 4 not just a prophet but turning
[2:15:08] hearts of the children back to faith
[2:15:11] giving them the vision
[2:15:14] seeing god's plan
[2:15:17] and he said and now
[2:15:19] and now there's nothing else left
[2:15:22] for it to come but for himself to step
[2:15:26] into that
[2:15:29] hallelujah because that's the last thing
[2:15:31] there is listen again i want to just say
[2:15:34] it again the last thing he steps into
[2:15:36] that
[2:15:39] amen we've had malachi 4. we've had the
[2:15:42] prophetic god we've had the tongues
[2:15:44] through pentecost
[2:15:45] somebody helped me preach hey man but
[2:15:48] this is where we're at is now the body
[2:15:51] is complete and what happens god steps
[2:15:55] into a people and glorifies their dust
[2:16:07] he said he's governed the body all the
[2:16:09] way through but then the complete body
[2:16:11] of christ is revealed in the form of the
[2:16:13] bride that was taken out of his side
[2:16:14] like adams was at the beginning
[2:16:18] now
[2:16:19] god in that day had to create a body
[2:16:22] even in the days of jesus he had to
[2:16:24] create a body jesus was the creation of
[2:16:27] god
[2:16:29] god created in the womb of mary a blood
[2:16:32] cell
[2:16:33] live dust collected around that made a
[2:16:36] body
[2:16:37] is that right
[2:16:39] but he doesn't have to create now
[2:16:42] you see
[2:16:43] you see
[2:16:44] why don't have to create because he has
[2:16:46] now redeemed dust
[2:16:51] through his blood through the shedding
[2:16:53] of his blood he has redeemed your blood
[2:16:57] or he has redeemed your flesh
[2:17:00] so he can use your flesh
[2:17:03] in a greater way than he did moses
[2:17:07] he could anoint that but now he can come
[2:17:09] and step into your body
[2:17:12] hallelujah and brother bradley said he
[2:17:14] can now use my flesh the same as he
[2:17:18] could create some because he made me
[2:17:21] anyhow he can use your flesh he created
[2:17:23] and made you don't you think that now if
[2:17:25] you'll just open up your heart and get
[2:17:27] yourself out of the way he'll come in
[2:17:29] and can use you he's the same god he
[2:17:32] gives the same signs
[2:17:35] hallelujah think about that then he can
[2:17:38] come into you
[2:17:40] if you'll open your heart he can come
[2:17:42] into your flesh
[2:17:44] just like he did coming to jesus
[2:17:48] come on somebody amen and he said the
[2:17:51] angel of the lord is here he's jehovah
[2:17:54] god in your flesh he shall hold the god
[2:17:56] in my flesh
[2:17:58] i want you to know brother branham
[2:17:59] didn't just leave it that jehovah is in
[2:18:02] my flesh he was not the fullness of the
[2:18:04] godhead in a body called william branham
[2:18:07] the fullness of the godhead was not
[2:18:09] being poured out in one man it was
[2:18:11] poured out into one body and that body
[2:18:14] is the church the bride
[2:18:16] [Applause]
[2:18:19] now god wants to use your dust
[2:18:25] that's who she appeared in
[2:18:28] he's appearing in his church in this
[2:18:30] last day he's appearing showing the same
[2:18:32] size
[2:18:34] that's the same attitude toward the set
[2:18:36] that he had has the same power
[2:18:39] the same deity the same god
[2:18:43] hallelujah speaks in tongues just like
[2:18:45] they did it sounds just like they did
[2:18:48] hallelujah sees vicious just like they
[2:18:50] did and not why because now he's not
[2:18:53] using that body he's using your body
[2:18:57] and the ministry of christ is here and
[2:19:00] it is on display
[2:19:02] in bride form
[2:19:08] the son of man
[2:19:10] what's now
[2:19:11] in the trial he said i challenge you to
[2:19:14] believe here's the challenge i challenge
[2:19:17] you to believe that jesus christ is
[2:19:19] revealed in this form of son of man in
[2:19:23] human flesh through the bride's body
[2:19:28] where is he going to be revealed son of
[2:19:30] man is going to be revealed where
[2:19:32] through the bride's body
[2:19:34] oh i i thought you know it was only in
[2:19:37] brother branham no it's in the bride's
[2:19:39] body
[2:19:40] this is where he's revealing himself
[2:19:44] sure he revealed himself in that
[2:19:46] prophetic office sure he uses to use his
[2:19:49] voice but that's not where his voice is
[2:19:52] now alone it's in a bright elect people
[2:19:58] amen his earthly ministry continues
[2:20:02] go with jesus brother branham said
[2:20:04] i believe his earthly ministry has never
[2:20:07] ceased
[2:20:09] because he's in his people now
[2:20:14] amen we ought to see him the same in
[2:20:17] every detail
[2:20:19] except his corporal body
[2:20:23] amen because now his body is not here we
[2:20:26] cannot reach out and touch the nail
[2:20:28] scarred one
[2:20:29] amen but god can use your body to heal

[2:23:09] in bride form
[2:23:13] hallelujah
[2:23:17] in acts chapter 10 verse 38
[2:23:19] god anointed jesus of nazareth with the

[2:23:57] christ who
[2:23:59] came here and give me a temporary
[2:24:00] resurrection by my spirit that my spirit
[2:24:03] goes away and his spirit comes down then

[2:24:10] me and my spirit we don't know you but
[2:24:13] he knows you
[2:24:14] watch now but he wants to borrow my body
[2:24:19] to prove he's the resurrected christ
[2:24:22] and he said i'm so happy to loan it to
[2:24:25] him
[2:24:26] give it to him anything he can get out
[2:24:29] of it
[2:24:31] that ought to be the same attitude that

[2:24:52] christ

[2:25:01] preached if a man is truly anointed of
[2:25:04] the spirit of god preaching the word
[2:25:05] it's the same thing is god going forth
[2:25:08] with his own word
[2:25:10] so through the ages
[2:25:11] it's been the dispensation of the holy
[2:25:13] ghost being poured out
[2:25:15] i'd like to review
[2:25:17] the book of acts and then joel's
[2:25:19] prophecy for a moment
[2:25:21] acts chapter 2 17
[2:25:23] for and it should come to pass in the
[2:25:25] last days
[2:25:27] how many knows what last days mean
[2:25:30] so brother tim
[2:25:32] that's just this day now
[2:25:34] last days is the last 2 000 years
[2:25:38] day with the lord's a thousand years
[2:25:41] and the last days in the seven church
[2:25:43] ages god has been poured out his spirit
[2:25:47] and he says i will pour out my spirit
[2:25:50] upon all flesh and your sons and your
[2:25:52] daughters shall prophesy and your young
[2:25:54] men shall see
[2:25:55] those visions your old men shall dream
[2:25:57] dreams and all my servants of my
[2:25:59] handmaids i will pour out in those days
[2:26:02] of my spirit and they shall prophesy
[2:26:06] now this pouring out of the spirit of
[2:26:08] god brings
[2:26:10] restoration
