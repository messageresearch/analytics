[54:11] visitation and wasn't able to stay for
[54:14] the rest of it but uh my goodness we had
[54:17] we were ministered to in so many
[54:19] different ways and of course the
[54:20] ministry that was here brother ron by
[54:23] the donny brother wendell
[54:25] uh brother danny steeman and um also
[54:28] brother wayne lawson that that spoke and
[54:30] then the many others that
[54:32] that um participated in the service it
[54:35] was
[54:35] it was just wonderful brother jeremy
[54:38] shriner was certainly blessed us with
[54:40] his songs and worship to the lord and we
[54:43] had a great time
[54:44] amen it was a great celebration
[54:47] and i was very proud of you because
[54:49] that's what we're to do we're to
[54:50] celebrate and to rejoice in what god has
[54:54] given us we have been blessed
[54:56] beyond measure
[54:57] amen and um
[54:59] you know it's um
[55:01] you know we it's not been revealed to me
[55:04] yet as to what god's purpose and plan is
[55:07] but we know that all things work
[55:09] together for the good of them that love
[55:11] god to them that are called according to
[55:14] his purpose
[55:16] as stated in the church age book he may
[55:18] commit you to death as he did paul
[55:20] he may commit you to suffering as he did
[55:22] job
[55:23] that is his prerogative
[55:25] he is sovereign but it is all with a
[55:28] purpose if he did not have a purpose
[55:30] then he would be the author of
[55:31] frustration and not a peace his purpose
[55:34] is that after we have suffered a while
[55:37] we should be made perfect be established
[55:39] strengthened and settled as job said he
[55:42] puts his strength puts strength in us
[55:45] and i just like to say we're not
[55:47] defeated we're not about to surrender
[55:50] and many of those that were listed in
[55:52] hebrews the 11th chapter which is
[55:55] in the chapter of the heroes of faith
[55:59] they went by the way of the grave yet
[56:01] they did not die faithless they all died
[56:04] in faith that's what the bible said
[56:06] these all died in faith and there's no
[56:08] shame in in death or going by the way of
[56:10] the grave
[56:12] simply because god does not intend us
[56:14] for us to live in these corruptable
[56:16] bodies forever
[56:18] so he actually sets a limit to our time
[56:21] here
[56:22] upon the earth
[56:23] in fact not only god
[56:26] not only that but god does not lead the
[56:28] dead and christ out in fact they are
[56:31] preferred before us
[56:33] for the bible said they will rise first
[56:36] and then we which are alive and remain
[56:38] shall be caught up together with them in
[56:40] the clouds to meet the lord in the air
[56:42] and so shall we ever be with the lord
[56:45] amen we're having some wonderful reports
[56:48] that are coming in from the youth camp
[56:50] and one of our young men
[56:53] you know brother william butts called me
[56:55] the other night after the service to say
[56:57] he and his brother joshua received the
[57:00] baptism of the holy ghost
[57:02] we have asked god for miracles
[57:05] and there's your miracles you've been
[57:06] wanting to see
[57:08] god is still moving these are the
[57:10] greatest miracles amen so god is still
[57:13] moving among us and we thank him for
[57:16] that first john chapter 3 and verse 1
[57:19] as we look into the word of god we're
[57:22] expecting him just to anoint the word to
[57:25] our hearts and reveal himself to us
[57:28] behold what manner of love the father
[57:31] hath bestowed upon us that we should be
[57:33] called the sons of god
[57:35] therefore the world knoweth us not
[57:37] because it knew him not beloved now we
[57:41] are the sons of god and yet it does not
[57:44] and and it does not yet appear what we
[57:46] shall be but we know that
[57:48] when he shall appear we shall be like
[57:51] him for we shall see him
[57:53] as he is
[57:55] and then first john 4 and verse 4 you
[57:58] have
[57:58] god little children
[58:00] and have overcome them because greater
[58:02] is he that is in you
[58:04] than he that is in the world and i have
[58:06] one more scripture that i'm going to
[58:08] read but i'm going to let you be seated
[58:10] as we read that one
[58:13] amen and trust in god will bless his
[58:15] word this morning revelation chapter 10
[58:18] and verse 1 it's a as a scripture that's
[58:21] referring to our day to our hour
[58:24] and i saw another mighty angel come down
[58:27] from heaven
[58:28] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was
[58:31] upon his head
[58:32] and his face was as it were the sun
[58:35] and his feet as pillars of fire
[58:38] and he had in his hand a little book
[58:40] open and he set his right foot up on the
[58:42] sea and his left foot on the earth and
[58:45] he cried with a loud voice as when a
[58:47] lion roared and when he had cried
[58:49] seven thunders uttered their voices
[58:52] and when the seven thunders had uttered
[58:54] their voices i was about to write and i
[58:56] heard a voice from heaven saying unto me
[58:59] seal up those things with the seven
[59:01] thunders uttered and write them not and
[59:04] the angel which i saw stand upon the sea
[59:07] and upon the earth lifted up his hand to
[59:09] heaven and swear by him that liveth
[59:12] forever and ever who created heaven and
[59:15] the things that therein are in the earth
[59:17] and the things that
[59:18] darien are in the sea and the things
[59:20] which are therein that there should be
[59:23] time no longer but in the days of the
[59:26] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[59:29] begin to sound the mystery of god should
[59:31] be finished as he had declared to his
[59:34] servants the prophets and the voice
[59:36] which i heard from heaven spake unto me
[59:38] again saying
[59:40] go and take the little book which is
[59:42] open in the hand of the angel which
[59:43] standeth upon the sea and upon the earth
[59:46] and i went unto the angel and said unto
[59:49] him give me the little book and he said
[59:51] unto me take it and eat it up and it
[59:54] shall make thy belly bitter but it shall
[59:57] be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i
[1:00:00] took the little book out of the angel's
[1:00:02] hand and ate it up
[1:00:04] and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey
[1:00:07] and as soon as i'd eaten it my belly was
[1:00:10] bitter and he said unto me thou must
[1:00:13] prophesy
[1:00:14] again
[1:00:16] before many peoples and nations and
[1:00:19] tongues and kings and you can see by
[1:00:22] this reading here that the bride of
[1:00:24] christ gets has the last prophecy
[1:00:28] amen
[1:00:29] today we're going to be speaking on the
[1:00:32] messiahs
[1:00:33] we of course are living in the greatest
[1:00:37] hour of the world the world has ever
[1:00:41] seen
[1:00:42] it is bride time
[1:00:44] it is the bright age
[1:00:46] where that god has called the people out
[1:00:48] of the tombs of religion
[1:00:50] and is bringing forth a resurrection in
[1:00:53] this hour
[1:00:55] now
[1:00:55] you know you some might object and say
[1:00:58] well surely not brother tim it's you
[1:01:01] know we're living in a time of great
[1:01:02] trouble and it's a time of death it's
[1:01:05] time where horrible things are happening
[1:01:08] and and there are of course or hundreds
[1:01:11] or thousands of people that are being
[1:01:14] slaughtered
[1:01:15] right now even as the u.s disgracefully
[1:01:18] pulls out of afghanistan and we even
[1:01:21] have believers there
[1:01:23] have received the lord and been baptized
[1:01:25] in the name of jesus christ and they're
[1:01:28] stranded there
[1:01:29] and the you know the
[1:01:32] and
[1:01:33] and other places like in myanmar where
[1:01:35] we were building
[1:01:37] a church there it sets uncompleted
[1:01:41] and believers are only able to meet in
[1:01:43] small groups because of the military
[1:01:45] takeover of the of the government
[1:01:48] bringing instability and horrible
[1:01:50] horrible persecution
[1:01:52] there are believers in china
[1:01:55] your brothers and sisters that are in
[1:01:57] prison or for just possessing or sharing
[1:02:01] a king james bible
[1:02:03] you know there are as we look there are
[1:02:07] pre-tribulation plagues that are falling
[1:02:09] and satan's anointing and his fear is
[1:02:13] almost so thick you can almost feel it
[1:02:16] and it's a dark spirit
[1:02:19] everywhere as we see friends ah precious
[1:02:23] friends
[1:02:24] like our brother jim babb that was
[1:02:26] mentioned today a dear friend that is
[1:02:30] dying of code that has died of covet and
[1:02:32] others that are dying of covet and
[1:02:35] diseases and afflictions and
[1:02:37] many others are confused and others are
[1:02:40] falling away
[1:02:42] and yeah there's tremendous suffering
[1:02:44] that's happening right now in haiti
[1:02:47] after a recent earthquake and thousands
[1:02:49] are now dead
[1:02:51] and so there's calamities and there's
[1:02:53] troubles and there's free tribulation
[1:02:55] plagues and there are rights that are
[1:02:58] breaking out there is instability there
[1:03:00] are people that are
[1:03:02] that are that are right daily you know
[1:03:05] asking lor you know please you know just
[1:03:07] for our bread please just send something
[1:03:10] to to give us to eat in india and africa
[1:03:13] and other places that are are just in in
[1:03:17] dire need today
[1:03:19] and it's it's kind of like cleopas and
[1:03:23] his friends
[1:03:24] on the road to emmaus remember jesus had
[1:03:28] died and was now buried and
[1:03:30] and they're on their way to emmaus they
[1:03:33] were told by jesus to go into
[1:03:36] um into the
[1:03:38] into jerusalem and to wait but
[1:03:40] but you know they could not comprehend
[1:03:44] at all the greatness of the hour that
[1:03:47] they were in
[1:03:48] the hour was so dark yet at the same
[1:03:51] time there was so many great things that
[1:03:55] were transpiring
[1:03:57] and these believers their minds were
[1:04:00] filled with the sight of their lord and
[1:04:02] master being spit upon and beaten and
[1:04:05] crucified and then dead hanging on a
[1:04:08] cross
[1:04:09] and sealed into it behind a tomb guarded
[1:04:12] by roman soldiers
[1:04:14] and to them there was nothing that was
[1:04:18] glorious about the present hour
[1:04:21] it was filled with pain
[1:04:23] confusion
[1:04:25] wild stories unanswered questions of why
[1:04:29] why
[1:04:30] why
[1:04:31] you know you know
[1:04:33] there were many prayers that had been
[1:04:35] prayed that were seemingly unanswered
[1:04:38] the anguish of jesus himself upon the
[1:04:42] cross
[1:04:43] crying out my god my god why hast thou
[1:04:47] forsaken me the anguish of the men and
[1:04:50] women
[1:04:51] and disciples who had cried and prayed
[1:04:54] for hours for deliverance
[1:04:57] hoping believing praying that any moment
[1:05:01] the power of god
[1:05:02] would that they had previously seen
[1:05:05] displayed that could open the eyes of
[1:05:07] the blind that could heal diseases could
[1:05:10] make the cripples walk and you know
[1:05:13] yet they seen it displayed and yet they
[1:05:16] were hoping praying believing
[1:05:19] now that
[1:05:20] any moment it would take him off of the
[1:05:23] cross
[1:05:25] and there was terrible disappointment of
[1:05:27] the disciples because things just simply
[1:05:30] hadn't turned out the way they had
[1:05:32] planned it
[1:05:33] things wouldn't happen the way they
[1:05:35] thought it would be
[1:05:37] and and they
[1:05:39] they were wondering and they were
[1:05:41] pondering and they were talking about it
[1:05:43] and they
[1:05:45] as they walked along the road to emmaus
[1:05:49] you know death and disappointments and
[1:05:52] heartaches they all everyone fit into
[1:05:55] god's great program
[1:05:57] why because always he has something
[1:05:59] better
[1:06:00] amen we prayed for healing for sister
[1:06:03] karen but god had a greater healing
[1:06:05] amen we we pray we ask for things but
[1:06:08] god
[1:06:09] he he gives us what we need
[1:06:12] sometimes not what we think we need
[1:06:15] but you see but i want to point out to
[1:06:18] you this is a resurrection hour
[1:06:21] if i could just get it to your heart
[1:06:23] this morning you know that it's not just
[1:06:26] a time of calamity and trouble and
[1:06:29] problems but it is a resurrection hour
[1:06:32] it is where the time as we have been
[1:06:35] dealing with uh in daniel chapter 12
[1:06:38] where the michael the great prince
[1:06:40] stands up on the behalf of god's people
[1:06:44] it is a time when satan this one who has
[1:06:47] brought sorrow and sin and persecution
[1:06:50] and sickness and death is now being cast
[1:06:55] down
[1:06:56] it is a time where satan's accusation is
[1:07:00] over because the blood has justified a
[1:07:03] people and has made them without spot or
[1:07:07] a wrinkle or a blemish
[1:07:09] it is a time where people's faith will
[1:07:12] not fail
[1:07:14] and when they look when they will look
[1:07:16] in the face of adversity and their faith
[1:07:20] will prevail
[1:07:22] i'm speaking to people today who doesn't
[1:07:26] just have faith but they have prevailing
[1:07:29] faith
[1:07:30] that will prevail in the time of
[1:07:33] difficulty it is a time when a people
[1:07:36] rises on the scene and they break the
[1:07:39] cycle of revival and death and instead
[1:07:42] of getting colder and more weary and
[1:07:46] more and more dreary and more broke down
[1:07:49] they will become more revived and
[1:07:51] empowered and rising up in the face of
[1:07:55] adversity
[1:07:56] it is a time where the church rises and
[1:07:59] returns to the power of pentecost
[1:08:02] and prevails and welcomes back the lord
[1:08:05] jesus
[1:08:07] a bride a people who will not go down
[1:08:10] and repeat what the ephesus aides did
[1:08:13] who aimed at the high calling and relax
[1:08:16] their grip
[1:08:17] this is not and i want to get this clear
[1:08:20] to you because many times we are
[1:08:22] mistaken in our preaching thinking that
[1:08:24] we are trying to revive azusa street
[1:08:28] or even that we're trying to
[1:08:30] repeat the day of pentecost
[1:08:33] but i you know the it is not a repeat of
[1:08:36] the day of pentecost the azusa movement
[1:08:39] repeated that when they went back down
[1:08:41] into death again
[1:08:43] they rose up only to fail
[1:08:46] but i want you to know we are in the
[1:08:48] hour of the fulfillment
[1:08:50] of pentecost when the day of pentecost
[1:08:53] is fully come
[1:08:55] it might not come to go down into defeat
[1:08:59] but come to take a people into complete
[1:09:02] and total victory
[1:09:04] now this may be a little over the head
[1:09:06] for some of you but hold tight and we'll
[1:09:09] come back maybe to something more
[1:09:11] more simpler for you but he comes in
[1:09:14] three sons name
[1:09:15] he comes as son of man and he reveals a
[1:09:18] self in prophetic form he comes the son
[1:09:21] of god and reveals himself as the spirit
[1:09:24] of god through the ages and then he
[1:09:27] comes again as we come to the end time
[1:09:31] and reveals itself once more and repeats
[1:09:33] the same thing again revealing himself
[1:09:36] in a prophetic way
[1:09:38] amen but then he will come and reign as
[1:09:40] son of david over in the millennial
[1:09:43] reign
[1:09:44] so we're we're living in an hour where
[1:09:47] there is wonderful marvelous things that
[1:09:50] are taking place
[1:09:51] on the day of pentecost he came as the
[1:09:54] son of god the spirit because god is a
[1:09:57] spirit
[1:09:58] and and this brought in the son of god
[1:10:01] dispensation which is reigned through
[1:10:04] the seven ages but here at the end of
[1:10:07] the ages
[1:10:08] how many blades were at the end of the
[1:10:10] ages
[1:10:11] where it's not another baptist age or
[1:10:13] presbyterian age or lutheran age or
[1:10:16] pentecostally but it is now the bride
[1:10:19] age
[1:10:20] where infancy is passed
[1:10:22] where immaturity is passed
[1:10:25] where it's adoption agents mature grain
[1:10:28] age it is the eagle age it's the rapture
[1:10:32] age
[1:10:33] it's the age of the son of man that's
[1:10:36] why we don't look for another upper room
[1:10:39] where 120 are gathered into churches
[1:10:42] born this is not the birth of the church
[1:10:45] this is the coronation
[1:10:47] of the church
[1:10:49] amen it's when the son of man is
[1:10:51] revealed as in the days of sodom and
[1:10:54] that visitation brings back about a
[1:10:56] change and the long-awaited promised son
[1:11:00] comes
[1:11:02] amen and he says as we read today and i
[1:11:06] saw another mighty angel
[1:11:09] it is a son of man dispensation and it's
[1:11:12] anointing and it's not an azusa street
[1:11:15] anointing upon just the flesh
[1:11:18] and just the spirit realm
[1:11:21] oh we saw many of them you know get it
[1:11:24] and it was a genuine holy ghost even
[1:11:27] sometimes speaking in genuine holy
[1:11:29] spirit tongues but yet not a real change
[1:11:32] to the soul
[1:11:33] and see them go right back out into sin
[1:11:36] and darkness again
[1:11:38] but it's not an azusa street anointing
[1:11:41] just upon the flesh and the spirit realm
[1:11:43] though some may still get it that way
[1:11:46] but there is something greater than that
[1:11:49] we are living in a day where it's not
[1:11:51] just an empty jump
[1:11:53] or an empty shout with no change to the
[1:11:56] life it's upon the soul
[1:11:58] and it seals unto the day of redemption
[1:12:03] hallelujah let me tell you this bride is
[1:12:06] not another church
[1:12:08] who ends up as a failure
[1:12:10] she cannot fall
[1:12:12] she unlike pentecost of 2000 years ago
[1:12:16] is predestinated not to fall
[1:12:20] god predestinated them to go as a seed
[1:12:23] into the ground because there would be
[1:12:25] many more that would come after them
[1:12:27] but god in this day has declared i'm not
[1:12:31] planting this church
[1:12:34] they will not all go by the way of the
[1:12:36] grave
[1:12:37] they will not go into decay
[1:12:39] they will not decline
[1:12:42] remember they will be
[1:12:44] gathered into my barn they will be
[1:12:47] raptured
[1:12:49] hallelujah we are not like pentecost up
[1:12:53] 2 000 years ago like that but we are a
[1:12:56] people who receive the word and instead
[1:12:59] of going into decline
[1:13:01] we keep accelerating we keep rising
[1:13:04] higher we keep moving on we keep
[1:13:08] advancing
[1:13:13] christ the mystery of god revealed
[1:13:15] brother branham talks about this and
[1:13:17] says predestinated
[1:13:19] well we can look back and we can say
[1:13:21] that some in that first days that were
[1:13:24] predestinated
[1:13:25] you know to
[1:13:27] god allowing them to go into the decay
[1:13:30] and decline and break out into the
[1:13:32] church jesus and and into the dark ages
[1:13:36] and and god predestinated the people in
[1:13:39] every one of those ages
[1:13:41] are you with me
[1:13:42] amen but we're predestinated that's the
[1:13:44] mystery see he before christ or anything
[1:13:47] was ever on the earth you see his great
[1:13:50] mystery that he chose the bride
[1:13:53] knowing that eve would fall from
[1:13:56] disbelieving the word knowing she would
[1:13:59] fall but he
[1:14:00] would choose a bride that would not fall
[1:14:05] that would hold to that word regardless
[1:14:08] of what the rest of the world had to say
[1:14:10] about it they would hold to that word
[1:14:13] they are predestinated
[1:14:15] to stand there
[1:14:16] the adoption of children by jesus christ
[1:14:20] predestinated that church to that great
[1:14:22] glorious stand
[1:14:24] how wonderful is that
[1:14:26] do you realize others were destined for
[1:14:30] different things
[1:14:31] some were destined to go down to death
[1:14:34] in the dark ages
[1:14:36] some were destined there to to protest
[1:14:38] the catholic church and bring a
[1:14:40] reformation
[1:14:42] some were destined to preach holiness
[1:14:44] some were destined to preach on gifts
[1:14:46] and see the holy spirit fall
[1:14:49] some were destined
[1:14:50] in in different ways but you have been
[1:14:54] destined
[1:14:56] pre-destined
[1:14:58] not too far
[1:15:01] hallelujah
[1:15:05] what a promise that is
[1:15:07] we're not just simply those who wash
[1:15:09] their robes in the blood of the lamb and
[1:15:11] make them white
[1:15:13] amen like those in revelation 7 who have
[1:15:16] to go through tribulation and miss the
[1:15:18] rapture and they got to go through
[1:15:20] they got to go through further purging
[1:15:24] that we are truly washed by the blood
[1:15:28] and our sins loosed and every stain is
[1:15:30] sin gone i want to just say we are more
[1:15:34] than that
[1:15:36] we are the blood of god
[1:15:38] by a new birth
[1:15:41] hallelujah
[1:15:43] amen every child that is born of human
[1:15:45] parents is born of those parents blood
[1:15:49] and since our parent in the new birth is
[1:15:51] god we are born of his blood
[1:15:54] come on
[1:15:55] amen so we are the blood of god by the
[1:15:58] new birth
[1:15:59] heaven is born again
[1:16:01] well you weren't born a corruptible seed
[1:16:03] peter said
[1:16:05] but you were born again of the word of
[1:16:07] god that liveth and abideth forever
[1:16:10] you are incorruptible seed
[1:16:14] hallelujah excuse me here in just a
[1:16:16] moment that's right
[1:16:20] incorruptible see
[1:16:23] the church he says is the blood of
[1:16:26] christ by the spirit
[1:16:29] because the life is in the blood
[1:16:31] that's the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:16:34] that baptizes us into his body that
[1:16:36] recognizes only his body his flesh his
[1:16:39] word
[1:16:40] denomination won't never touch that
[1:16:43] it's a revelation she knows it so did
[1:16:45] eve know it but she failed but this one
[1:16:48] knows it and won't fall
[1:16:51] she is ordained hallelujah
[1:16:54] she's ordained not to fall
[1:16:58] she won't fail
[1:17:00] she is predestinated to it
[1:17:03] blessed is the man whom god will not
[1:17:06] impute sin
[1:17:10] hallelujah
[1:17:11] a people ordained
[1:17:14] not to fall
[1:17:16] hallelujah
[1:17:18] now the coming of the mighty of the holy
[1:17:20] spirit in the form of this mighty angel
[1:17:23] with the open book
[1:17:25] it brings its people
[1:17:29] into a messianic age
[1:17:32] where there is again a messiah upon the
[1:17:36] earth
[1:17:37] you say well we're looking for the lord
[1:17:39] brother tim we're looking for his coming
[1:17:41] well certainly there is a meeting in the
[1:17:43] air don't ever forget it
[1:17:46] it is the hope of the believer
[1:17:49] believers believe that
[1:17:51] amen but however again you know we we we
[1:17:55] know that there is a messiah now upon
[1:17:59] the earth
[1:18:00] there is a form that christ is in
[1:18:04] that is here in our midst today
[1:18:08] amen not coming but here
[1:18:11] am i not not something that is abstract
[1:18:14] but present
[1:18:16] something that is real
[1:18:18] hallelujah
[1:18:20] amen and and so
[1:18:22] there is a messiah upon the earth he
[1:18:26] said what in the world you mean by
[1:18:27] messiah what do you mean by messiah by
[1:18:30] the time a messiah is an anointed one of
[1:18:33] god
[1:18:36] now
[1:18:38] here's what brother bradham said and who
[1:18:40] do you say this is
[1:18:41] give me a church
[1:18:43] are you ready for this
[1:18:45] that's so completely anointed with god
[1:18:48] till their ever moving action is thus
[1:18:51] saith the lord
[1:18:52] walk in that's your kind of glory and
[1:18:54] i'll show you a messiah an anointed one
[1:18:58] of god standing upon the earth
[1:19:02] hallelujah
[1:19:03] so brother madam tells us that a church
[1:19:06] surrendered to god and anointed to god
[1:19:09] walking in the shekinah glory is the
[1:19:12] messiah
[1:19:14] an anointed one of god standing upon the
[1:19:17] earth
[1:19:19] now friends that's what we saw
[1:19:21] this anointing do to a man our messenger
[1:19:24] it took him beyond anything
[1:19:26] denominations ever experienced
[1:19:30] denominations could never carry you that
[1:19:32] far
[1:19:33] it made him a messiah
[1:19:37] now not the messiah
[1:19:40] there's only one d messiah that's jesus
[1:19:43] christ
[1:19:44] but a little messiah an anointed one of
[1:19:46] god a full-fledged son
[1:19:51] amen now remember as christ descends he
[1:19:54] descends from heaven with a shout
[1:19:58] let's look at first thessalonians 4 16
[1:20:01] for the lord himself shall descend from
[1:20:04] heaven with a shout
[1:20:06] and with the voice of the archangel and
[1:20:08] with the trump of god and the dead in
[1:20:10] christ shall rise first
[1:20:13] so you see here he comes as he descends
[1:20:16] he starts his dissension and he does
[1:20:19] three things as he descends
[1:20:22] right
[1:20:23] he has a shout he has a voice and a
[1:20:25] trump
[1:20:27] now all of these are phases of his
[1:20:29] coming
[1:20:31] amen not one of them
[1:20:33] singularly is his coming
[1:20:35] and one cannot be
[1:20:37] complete without the other
[1:20:39] amen if you miss the shout you're not
[1:20:42] going to be the voice if you don't
[1:20:44] become the voice you'll never hear the
[1:20:46] trunk
[1:20:49] all right so you see the lord himself
[1:20:51] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[1:20:54] now this ain't a funeral scripture
[1:20:57] this was a prophecy for the last day
[1:21:00] that we often refer to to comfort one
[1:21:03] another with these words but that's not
[1:21:05] that's not what it is it's a prophecy
[1:21:09] amen and when god gives a prophecy there
[1:21:11] has to come a fulfillment
[1:21:14] and we're not living in the day of the
[1:21:16] prophecy we're living in the hour of the
[1:21:18] fulfillment
[1:21:20] are you with me
[1:21:22] now so you see he comes with a shout so
[1:21:26] his first phase of his coming is with
[1:21:29] his shout a mighty message
[1:21:32] you know it's got to be saying something
[1:21:34] or it means nothing
[1:21:36] right it's just an uncertain sound
[1:21:39] so you see it's got to have a meaning
[1:21:41] it's got to be saying something if he
[1:21:43] descends from heaven with a shout he's
[1:21:45] got to have something he's saying
[1:21:48] there is a purpose he's gathering
[1:21:51] he uh he is bringing people up to to a
[1:21:55] message they're hearing what the spirit
[1:21:58] is saying
[1:21:59] are you with me
[1:22:00] amen so let's let's look at here as we
[1:22:03] go back to revelation 10 1 and let's
[1:22:06] talk take a look at here because this is
[1:22:09] the scripture of of his coming in our
[1:22:13] day amen
[1:22:15] amen
[1:22:16] this again
[1:22:18] is like pentecost in the sin in the
[1:22:20] sense it's not a physical coming
[1:22:23] it's a supernatural event
[1:22:26] it of course will finally materialize in
[1:22:30] a physical form
[1:22:33] it's important you never get your eyes
[1:22:35] off of his
[1:22:37] his uh of of the the rapture the
[1:22:40] you know sometimes we can explain this
[1:22:42] so what we wait till we don't even
[1:22:45] appreciate anymore the coming of the
[1:22:48] lord jesus
[1:22:52] but as we look at this and i saw another
[1:22:55] mighty angel
[1:22:57] come down from heaven
[1:22:59] clothed with a cloud
[1:23:01] a rainbow was upon his head
[1:23:03] his face was as it were the sun his feet
[1:23:06] as pillars of fire and he had in his
[1:23:09] hand a little book open and his right
[1:23:12] foot was upon set his right foot upon
[1:23:14] the sea and his left foot on the earth
[1:23:17] and he cried
[1:23:19] right
[1:23:22] he what
[1:23:23] he cried that is he shouted
[1:23:27] he wasn't weeping
[1:23:29] we didn't need to hand him a box of
[1:23:30] kleenexes
[1:23:32] he wasn't crying he was shouting
[1:23:37] and he shouted with a loud voice
[1:23:40] and he does it as a lion roar
[1:23:43] hallelujah because when a lion the king
[1:23:46] of the jungle speaks
[1:23:48] and roars
[1:23:50] even the locus and the insects shout out
[1:23:53] why the king has spoken
[1:23:56] amen this lion's lord ceases every other
[1:24:00] voice hallelujah amen you want to talk
[1:24:04] about critics you want to talk about
[1:24:06] unbelievers and what they're saying i
[1:24:08] can't hear it
[1:24:10] oh man it's all been silenced
[1:24:13] by the king's voice
[1:24:15] it's all been silenced by a shout out
[1:24:19] amen the silence has has come upon all
[1:24:22] of them but for us the silence has been
[1:24:25] broken
[1:24:27] hallelujah
[1:24:28] he shouted with a loud voice
[1:24:31] as when a lion roared and when he had
[1:24:33] shouted or cried seven thunders uttered
[1:24:36] their voices
[1:24:38] now all of this is symbology in the
[1:24:40] bible the book of revelation is a book
[1:24:42] of symbols
[1:24:43] and the lion's roar is the king's
[1:24:45] message
[1:24:47] and it comes through a prophet
[1:24:50] because the lord god will do nothing
[1:24:52] except he reveals his secrets to his
[1:24:54] servants of prophets amos 3 7.
[1:24:57] so you see this this is it is a lion's
[1:25:01] lord the king's message
[1:25:04] comes to a prophet and when it does
[1:25:07] the voice of god thunders out
[1:25:09] breaking the silence on things that have
[1:25:12] been
[1:25:13] that have been silenced for
[1:25:15] thousands of years now
[1:25:17] but this time it's not a sealed
[1:25:20] utterance
[1:25:21] it's not something sealed up for another
[1:25:24] generation
[1:25:25] we are the generation
[1:25:27] it was spoken for
[1:25:30] hallelujah amen it is not a sealed
[1:25:33] utterance or a sealed book but this time
[1:25:35] it comes down as an open book
[1:25:38] as a prophetic utterance
[1:25:40] what is it it's the son of man christ
[1:25:43] our lord jesus revealing himself through
[1:25:46] a son of man a prophet
[1:25:50] amen
[1:25:51] now you see christ had the coming word
[1:25:53] for him first
[1:25:57] you got to understand the sequence of
[1:25:58] his coming
[1:26:00] he couldn't just come and appear nobody
[1:26:02] nobody would be prepared for his coming
[1:26:07] they might mentally lost their way
[1:26:09] we got 40 000 different denominational
[1:26:12] denominations out there
[1:26:14] try to wade through all of them
[1:26:16] try to figure figure them all out see
[1:26:19] where they're on or where they're off
[1:26:22] are you with me amen but you see christ
[1:26:25] had to come in word for him
[1:26:28] before he can come and groom for him
[1:26:31] yes we want to meet him in the air
[1:26:33] yes we want the resurrection of the
[1:26:36] saints
[1:26:37] yes we want you know our loved ones to
[1:26:39] appear to us
[1:26:41] amen we want to be changed in a moment
[1:26:44] in the twinkling of an eye don't we
[1:26:46] amen but before he could do that he had
[1:26:49] to send a message to turn our hearts
[1:26:52] back to faith again
[1:26:55] back to the original faith
[1:26:57] amen
[1:26:59] so he's
[1:27:00] so again he would send a preparation
[1:27:03] something to prepare us for that coming
[1:27:07] he would sin as he did in the first age
[1:27:09] of john the baptist to forerun his
[1:27:12] coming an elijah ministry that would go
[1:27:16] forth in the spirit and the power of
[1:27:18] elijah
[1:27:19] and would you and as it would go forth
[1:27:21] than that he would he would bring forth
[1:27:23] a message to to prepare
[1:27:26] to prepare a people to receive a message
[1:27:30] amen prepare a piece of people to
[1:27:33] receive a word a word that would set
[1:27:37] them straight
[1:27:38] that would bring them back into balance
[1:27:41] that would give them understanding as
[1:27:43] daniel 12 said none of the wicked will
[1:27:46] have understanding but the wise shall
[1:27:49] understand
[1:27:51] amen so they had to come and understand
[1:27:54] it and to do that god would send a
[1:27:56] forerunner and this forerunner would
[1:27:59] prepare the way
[1:28:01] it was you know he would make the path
[1:28:03] for the word to come behind
[1:28:06] brother branham would say in the church
[1:28:08] age book it says it this way and and and
[1:28:12] brother kalin who's listening in from
[1:28:14] south africa pastor there god bless you
[1:28:17] and the saints there brother caleb we
[1:28:18] love you
[1:28:19] amen but in the exposition to the seven
[1:28:22] church ages brother caitlyn shared this
[1:28:24] to with me this
[1:28:26] i read it first about two in the morning
[1:28:29] he is some sending someone
[1:28:32] who is so far from organization
[1:28:35] education
[1:28:37] and the world of religion that has john
[1:28:40] the baptist and and eligible he will
[1:28:43] hear only from god because he will have
[1:28:46] thus saith the lord and speak for god
[1:28:50] he will be god's mouthpiece
[1:28:53] and he as it is declared in malachi 4 6
[1:28:57] will turn the hearts of the children
[1:28:59] back to the fathers
[1:29:01] he will bring back the elect of the last
[1:29:04] day and they will hear a vindicated
[1:29:06] prophet give the exact truth as it was
[1:29:09] to with paul he will restore the truth
[1:29:12] as they had it and those elect with him
[1:29:15] in that day are you with me
[1:29:17] ready for this
[1:29:19] amen those elect with him
[1:29:21] in that day will be the ones who truly
[1:29:25] manifest the lord
[1:29:27] and be his body and be his voice
[1:29:31] and perform his works hallelujah do you
[1:29:35] see it
[1:29:36] amen that's exactly right that will be
[1:29:38] his body will be his voice and perform
[1:29:41] his works
[1:29:43] you cannot do that without being a
[1:29:45] messiah
[1:29:47] amen you have to be an anointed church
[1:29:51] hallelujah
[1:29:52] amen this word coming was promised
[1:29:55] a message that would come to turn our
[1:29:58] hearts back
[1:29:59] the spoken words original seed brother
[1:30:01] branham would share with us his mission
[1:30:04] he said my mission i believe that god
[1:30:06] has called me for and i have some say
[1:30:08] some personal things today because
[1:30:10] that's what i told you i would do and
[1:30:12] tell the world my mission
[1:30:14] i believe to the earth
[1:30:16] is what to forerun
[1:30:19] the coming word
[1:30:21] see the coming word which is christ
[1:30:24] now he told us he would he would
[1:30:27] absolutely be son of god to forerun the
[1:30:31] coming word
[1:30:33] and that word would be christ and then
[1:30:35] christ would be in the word and in
[1:30:38] christ in him has a millennium
[1:30:40] everything in there every promise of the
[1:30:43] word lays there
[1:30:45] within that message
[1:30:47] and he did he flew around it he pulled
[1:30:49] around it with divine healings with
[1:30:52] miracles
[1:30:54] thousands of them not one or two
[1:30:56] amen he had them with signs showing the
[1:31:00] presence of the word discerns the
[1:31:02] thoughts in the infants the heart
[1:31:04] he forerun with the vindication of the
[1:31:08] coming word he proved it's the word i'm
[1:31:10] bringing
[1:31:12] because the word is the only thing that
[1:31:14] can discern the thoughts and the intents
[1:31:17] of the heart
[1:31:19] and it would prove that it was the word
[1:31:21] we needed vindication
[1:31:24] now the baptists have their vindication
[1:31:26] from their school
[1:31:28] ever ever presbyterian pastor will have
[1:31:31] his vindication
[1:31:33] that he is sent by them and that he is
[1:31:35] trained by them and he's qualified to
[1:31:38] speak for them because they have a
[1:31:40] certificate from him
[1:31:42] right that is that's the way they do in
[1:31:45] denomination but god was sent a
[1:31:46] forerunner who was uneducated who did
[1:31:50] not use the thoughts of man who would
[1:31:52] have to hear directly from god himself
[1:31:56] and god would certify that his message
[1:31:59] was not a man but it was a god it would
[1:32:02] give witness to it service after service
[1:32:06] telling people where they were from what
[1:32:08] their address was what their sickness
[1:32:10] was
[1:32:11] what their future would be even what
[1:32:13] happened 40 years ago
[1:32:21] god vindicated it
[1:32:23] and there has to be a message first
[1:32:26] remember first things first
[1:32:29] you don't get changed and then the
[1:32:31] message
[1:32:34] you don't become the voice and don't
[1:32:35] know what to say
[1:32:40] there has to become a message
[1:32:43] and and and it's the word
[1:32:45] you say well that's it brother tim see
[1:32:48] it ain't all this hooping and hollering
[1:32:49] it's a word revival you know
[1:32:52] but it's not an intellectual revival
[1:32:57] amen as brother branham said the gospel
[1:32:59] isn't word only but through power and
[1:33:02] manifestation of the holy spirit it
[1:33:04] would produce the signs of mark 16 when
[1:33:07] he said go into all the world preach the
[1:33:09] gospel to every creature these signs
[1:33:11] shall follow them the word itself is
[1:33:14] dead
[1:33:15] until it becomes into an action and
[1:33:18] produces life
[1:33:20] so under understand it's not a it's not
[1:33:23] a a teaching it's not just a doctrine
[1:33:26] with no life in it
[1:33:28] it's a word with power in it
[1:33:32] transforming power
[1:33:34] healing power deliverance power
[1:33:41] but i just want to inform you
[1:33:44] if you think for a moment that there's
[1:33:46] all
[1:33:47] all there is to to the coming is a
[1:33:49] prophet with a message you're sadly
[1:33:51] mistaken
[1:33:53] and if you think that's the summit
[1:33:57] and that's the climax and that's the
[1:33:59] product and that's what god wanted was
[1:34:02] just that you are really mistaken
[1:34:07] you see you know this has been the
[1:34:09] spirit of denomination wants to cabbage
[1:34:12] down on one little part of it
[1:34:15] and say this is it and that's all right
[1:34:18] that you know as brother timothy read
[1:34:20] the quote the other day of reaching the
[1:34:22] summit every one of them believed they
[1:34:23] had reached the summit
[1:34:29] but i want you to know even though
[1:34:32] it was wonderful what god did
[1:34:35] sending a messenger
[1:34:37] sending a message
[1:34:38] and if you haven't heard it you ought to
[1:34:40] be hearing it
[1:34:42] and it's a value it's a worth
[1:34:45] it's a great importance
[1:34:47] hey man you
[1:34:49] again you know unless you get the first
[1:34:51] part you'll never get the second part
[1:34:55] am i but if you think that's all there
[1:34:56] is to it there's a prophet coming with a
[1:34:58] message you're mistaken this message was
[1:35:01] not about just a prophet
[1:35:05] it was not just manifesting the
[1:35:08] the christ in a prophetic form of of a
[1:35:12] man who would be elijah and though he
[1:35:14] was and though he had a great work and
[1:35:16] though he is a great man and though we
[1:35:18] honor that and we appreciate that we
[1:35:20] recognize that
[1:35:23] and we know it's a message from god
[1:35:26] but again i want you just to think of
[1:35:29] this as brother madam told us spoken
[1:35:31] words original seed as the end time
[1:35:34] prophecies repeat i think you ought to
[1:35:37] write that down
[1:35:38] end time prophecies repeat now he's
[1:35:41] going back into the scripture and he
[1:35:43] said these prophecies are repeating in
[1:35:45] the end time
[1:35:47] as the first forerunner came
[1:35:51] from the wilderness and cried behold the
[1:35:53] lamb of god
[1:35:55] the second forerunner will probably do
[1:35:58] the same by pointing the people to a
[1:36:00] word born bride
[1:36:04] so not only would he forerun and prepare
[1:36:08] the way for the word a message to come
[1:36:11] but he would prepare the way for a bride
[1:36:14] to come
[1:36:18] if you would just get it
[1:36:20] he was your forerunner
[1:36:24] he was preparing the way for you to come
[1:36:28] amen he was coming forth and said
[1:36:30] there's going to be more just like this
[1:36:34] amen i'm not the fulfillment of it all
[1:36:37] there's a people there's a bride there's
[1:36:39] a left
[1:36:40] amen who who will be
[1:36:43] the embodiment of the prophecies
[1:36:47] amen
[1:36:48] he said he would point the people to a
[1:36:50] word born bride and then he said the
[1:36:51] bride of christ will be pointed to the
[1:36:53] disguise at the appearance of jesus
[1:36:55] screaming behold the lamb of god will
[1:36:57] come forth from his lips
[1:36:59] god help us to be ready for this near
[1:37:01] event
[1:37:03] but by the way
[1:37:05] talking about behold the lamb of god
[1:37:09] there has to be
[1:37:11] a lamb on earth
[1:37:14] for a marriage to take place with the
[1:37:16] lamb
[1:37:22] i want you to just ponder on that just
[1:37:24] for a moment
[1:37:25] the bible is clear the species must
[1:37:28] marry species
[1:37:30] the kind must must unite with kind
[1:37:35] god cannot just take anything he has to
[1:37:38] have a lamb
[1:37:41] a bride who is the lamb of god upon the
[1:37:44] earth obedient surrendered
[1:37:49] yield to him
[1:37:51] come on now
[1:37:52] amen so there is a bride god there is a
[1:37:55] lamb coming in the skies but there's got
[1:37:57] to be a lamb on earth to match up with
[1:38:00] the lamb coming from heaven
[1:38:02] so in order for jesus to come in order
[1:38:06] for him to be here he has to come in
[1:38:09] word form
[1:38:10] and then in bribe form
[1:38:14] amen amen now we're taking another step
[1:38:19] because again it's not that you do away
[1:38:22] with the other it's just one is the
[1:38:24] advice is advancing the other one
[1:38:28] are you with me now
[1:38:30] so therefore the lamb of god that the
[1:38:32] first forerunner will will the second
[1:38:34] forerunner will probably do the same by
[1:38:36] pointing the people to a word born bride
[1:38:42] i want to say today
[1:38:45] behold the lamb of god
[1:38:55] the bride the elect lady
[1:38:58] not just here and even in like
[1:39:00] tabernacle but around the world
[1:39:03] a people who have been not just washed
[1:39:06] but born of his blood
[1:39:09] a people who who are so united with him
[1:39:14] until he and them are the same
[1:39:16] that they are actually his body upon the
[1:39:19] earth
[1:39:20] amen
[1:39:22] now as he said in christ the mystery
[1:39:24] which you know i've been studying there
[1:39:26] would come a time forth when he could
[1:39:28] express himself in the fullness of his
[1:39:31] godhead deity through his church had the
[1:39:35] preeminence in his church
[1:39:37] what the anointed man now
[1:39:40] the anointed people
[1:39:42] oh my to bring back the anointed bride
[1:39:45] and bridegroom
[1:39:46] anointed by why
[1:39:49] accepting what eve turned down which was
[1:39:51] the word she denied the word of god and
[1:39:54] adam and coming back with the anointing
[1:39:56] of the word because he said my word is
[1:39:58] spirit see anointed with the word what
[1:40:01] even turned down
[1:40:03] we come back
[1:40:05] and accept
[1:40:09] and he believed everything she failed on
[1:40:11] one point that god would keep his word
[1:40:13] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:40:15] forever
[1:40:17] but there is a bride in this end time
[1:40:20] who is going to believe every word of
[1:40:22] god
[1:40:24] amen they're going to live
[1:40:27] by every word
[1:40:28] that proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[1:40:31] these men and women are
[1:40:33] that as that church not not so much
[1:40:36] individually but exact church they are
[1:40:39] anointed
[1:40:41] messiahs
[1:40:44] now
[1:40:45] as he said in perfect faith we become
[1:40:47] anointed with that same spirit anointed
[1:40:50] messiahs
[1:40:51] anointed messiahs of the last day to
[1:40:54] shine forth the resurrection of jesus
[1:40:57] christ to show he's not dead
[1:41:00] but in the form of the holy ghost he's
[1:41:03] in his people he's moving among his
[1:41:06] bride with a love affair to her pouring
[1:41:09] out to her into her himself and they
[1:41:12] become one for the wedding supper
[1:41:15] and the same signs promised by the same
[1:41:18] god in the same word is making the same
[1:41:20] manifestation and there's nothing left
[1:41:23] for us to do but believe it
[1:41:27] hey man how many can say i believe it
[1:41:30] nothing left for us to do but believe it
[1:41:33] amen believe it he said it's a substance
[1:41:36] and that creates a perfect faith oh just
[1:41:38] think how numb we are just think just a
[1:41:41] minute oh and i just say don't be numb
[1:41:45] fools and slow of heart to believe all
[1:41:48] that the prophet has spoken
[1:41:50] this is what he said to them on the mace
[1:41:52] walk
[1:41:52] that's right
[1:41:54] again
[1:41:56] look
[1:41:56] we right now remember
[1:41:58] we are flesh of his flesh
[1:42:00] bone of his bone and as god raises bones
[1:42:03] and flesh out the grave that cannot hide
[1:42:07] the man that has the potentials
[1:42:09] death cannot take him jesus said all the
[1:42:12] father is given to me we'll come and
[1:42:14] i'll raise him up at the last day oh my
[1:42:17] easter why we're right in easter
[1:42:20] when he raised we raised with him he
[1:42:23] sent the abstract back that's the holy
[1:42:25] ghost our deed is clear we hold it as
[1:42:28] the baptism of the holy ghost he's alive
[1:42:31] forevermore the same yesterday today and
[1:42:33] forever hebrews 13 8 proves that he is
[1:42:37] the same
[1:42:39] his messianic anointed ones believe that
[1:42:44] what is the messiah
[1:42:46] messiah is anointed one and now if he
[1:42:49] was anointed by being the anointed one
[1:42:52] for that day to fulfill the word of god
[1:42:54] to be the redeemer
[1:42:56] and and the anointed one and god has
[1:42:58] raised up that body his bride are you
[1:43:01] ready for this his bride is the anointed
[1:43:04] one for this day it's already raised
[1:43:07] with him in the resurrection because
[1:43:09] these two are one
[1:43:14] hallelujah
[1:43:16] i'm looking across
[1:43:17] in this very dark hour and i'm seeing
[1:43:20] resurrection life all over this building
[1:43:24] amen i i went to i went brother tim and
[1:43:27] george winters bro both of them brothers
[1:43:29] they took me and brother timothy up into
[1:43:32] colorado as we're riding along i'm just
[1:43:35] i'm just remembered and i'm just
[1:43:38] thinking again of where jesus found them
[1:43:43] that they were dead
[1:43:45] in sins and trespasses
[1:43:49] they found that they are miracles
[1:43:52] if you never see another miracle they
[1:43:54] are miracles
[1:43:56] amen that god would take them out of the
[1:43:59] life of sin and you see even friends and
[1:44:02] relatives that were around them and the
[1:44:04] kind of life that they live
[1:44:06] and the wretchedness and the condition
[1:44:09] and the death are you with me dying
[1:44:12] condition and god raised their men up
[1:44:16] everybody changed them and made them and
[1:44:18] gave them a new life
[1:44:20] and drugs and alcohol and filthy sex
[1:44:23] things and everything else fell off and
[1:44:26] he transformed and he made them new
[1:44:28] creatures
[1:44:31] i'm talking about resurrected ones
[1:44:34] i'm talking about ones that was dead in
[1:44:37] sins and trespasses
[1:44:40] hallelujah but now they're alive
[1:44:43] forevermore and they truly have the keys
[1:44:46] of death and of hell and there is
[1:44:49] nothing can separate them from the love
[1:44:51] of god in christ jesus
[1:44:55] i'm talking about the power of
[1:44:57] transformation the power of resurrection
[1:45:03] sometimes we see all the darkness
[1:45:06] we see all the fears around we see all
[1:45:08] the troubles and we fail to see a
[1:45:11] resurrection is taking place
[1:45:23] sometimes
[1:45:24] we think about the gates of hell being
[1:45:26] against us
[1:45:28] and jesus said it would be
[1:45:32] but listen what brother bradley said the
[1:45:34] gates of hells are against
[1:45:36] he said watch and see where the gates of
[1:45:39] hell is against
[1:45:41] it isn't against denomination the
[1:45:43] government recognizes that it ain't the
[1:45:45] world recognized our denominations all
[1:45:47] of them we have a right each one of us
[1:45:50] is american citizens
[1:45:52] the rights of denomination which is fine
[1:45:54] we appreciate that but that's not what
[1:45:57] the gate of hell's against
[1:46:00] it is against the spiritual revelation
[1:46:04] of christ being
[1:46:06] here now
[1:46:10] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:46:12] that's what is against the gates of hell
[1:46:14] shall be against it but it shall never
[1:46:16] prevail
[1:46:19] the gates of hell are against christ
[1:46:22] being here now that revelation
[1:46:26] that he's here present now
[1:46:29] that he's here in his church that god is
[1:46:32] in his people
[1:46:33] amen sure god was in his universe
[1:46:36] amen he created the sun and all the moon
[1:46:39] and everything else and you can see him
[1:46:40] in nature god's in his universe god was
[1:46:43] in his son
[1:46:46] but that's not where god is now god is
[1:46:48] in his people i'm not on earth where god
[1:46:52] is
[1:46:52] where he's in now is god is in his
[1:46:55] people
[1:46:56] a people who the word oh god that
[1:46:59] message has went further than books and
[1:47:03] tapes
[1:47:04] it has been transferred into hearts and
[1:47:07] lives
[1:47:10] hallelujah amen and it doesn't take
[1:47:12] years of study to do that it takes one
[1:47:15] moment in the presence of god and he'll
[1:47:17] write his very nature into your life
[1:47:24] the gates of hell shall be against it
[1:47:26] what be against what the revelation that
[1:47:29] christ is here now
[1:47:33] brother branham said in the message
[1:47:34] super sign i'm thankful for a church
[1:47:37] universal

[1:48:00] talking about jesus has come to the and
[1:48:03] jesus said every spirit in your bible
[1:48:05] jesus said every spirit that does not
[1:48:08] confess this is the wrong spirit the
[1:48:10] antichrist every spirit that doesn't
[1:48:13] witness the same thing that christ has
[1:48:16] come
[1:48:17] in our flesh is the antichrist spirit
[1:48:22] now there's where you got to discern and
[1:48:24] withstand the antichrist spirit
[1:48:27] when it says well it was back in brother
[1:48:29] branham's day and it'll be when some day
[1:48:32] in the future but it isn't now
[1:48:35] you see that's your antichrist spirit
[1:48:38] that wants to make the church cold and
[1:48:40] powerless and formal
[1:48:43] amen but let me tell you friend every
[1:48:45] spirit that doesn't witness that christ
[1:48:48] is coming our flesh is the antichrist
[1:48:51] spirit
[1:48:52] hallelujah god is here where is he at
[1:48:56] people are screaming everywhere just
[1:48:57] like they did in his first coming where
[1:49:00] is he king of the jews
[1:49:04] where is he where is he
[1:49:06] here now at the death of jesus and and
[1:49:10] this very hour and you're wondering
[1:49:12] where is he and what happened to him and
[1:49:14] why oh god why oh why did you forsake us
[1:49:18] how come you didn't answer our prayer
[1:49:20] and you hear god was already right there
[1:49:23] in their midst performing resurrection
[1:49:25] and i want to look at every one of you
[1:49:27] here today that have been saved by the
[1:49:30] grace of god and say you are
[1:49:32] resurrection
[1:49:35] hallelujah we're not talking about 2 000
[1:49:38] years ago of jesus rising from the truth
[1:49:41] we're talking about you
[1:49:43] well you were dead in sins and
[1:49:46] trespasses

[1:49:51] alive

[1:50:01] hallelujah
[1:50:04] he would take the wage sheath like a
[1:50:06] forerunner
[1:50:07] the wave sheath is the first of the
[1:50:09] grain
[1:50:10] in israel they would have celebrations
[1:50:13] and god would require an offering to be
[1:50:15] made before they could take the harvest
[1:50:18] and they would go and collect the first
[1:50:20] mature
[1:50:21] grains of wheats and make a sheep and
[1:50:23] they would take
[1:50:24] then and offer that and wave it before
[1:50:26] the lord
[1:50:28] and of course you know it was a
[1:50:31] it was the first fruits
[1:50:33] of the resurrection

[1:50:53] fruits
[1:50:54] because he is the first fruit of the
[1:50:57] resurrection
[1:51:01] amen
[1:51:02] in the in that sense he is the
[1:51:04] forerunner for all of us
[1:51:07] the bible don't get offended in that the
[1:51:09] bible in the book of hebrews said he's a
[1:51:11] forerunner who went before us to enter
[1:51:13] behind the veil
[1:51:15] but in this he was also a forerunner
[1:51:18] and that he would be the first one
[1:51:22] of all the ages
[1:51:24] that would come to maturity
[1:51:27] hallelujah the first grain that was
[1:51:31] planted all the way back with adam now

[1:51:51] prophets he is the manifestation of
[1:51:54] every promise of god and it's all
[1:51:56] embodied in him
[1:52:03] what was in abraham and seed form what
[1:52:05] was in
[1:52:06] in noah in seed form what was in all of
[1:52:09] this seed form here he is
[1:52:11] the fullness of the godhead in a body
[1:52:15] a grain
[1:52:17] and there on the first day of the week
[1:52:21] while in the temple they're offering the
[1:52:23] the wave sheath
[1:52:25] thanking god for the harvest

[1:53:09] those that slept and he he he was waved
[1:53:13] there believing the rest of them would
[1:53:15] come and they did
[1:53:17] the bible said when he rose and many of
[1:53:20] the saints would slept rose with him
[1:53:23] would say they didn't all do it brother
[1:53:25] to him no because a lot of people
[1:53:27] thought some were saints weren't saints
[1:53:31] but all that was predestinated by
[1:53:33] almighty god rose with him
[1:53:36] and ascended and he emptied paradise
[1:53:40] he was the first fruits
[1:53:42] amen and i want to just bring it down so
[1:53:44] was god sent a ministry in this day that
[1:53:48] was a sign a sign of a mature week
[1:53:52] demonstrating to us what the rest of the
[1:53:55] crop would be like
[1:53:58] come on now
[1:53:59] amen all you you wonder what the pride
[1:54:02] should be just look at the forerunner
[1:54:04] what was he like
[1:54:06] the pride will be the same thing

[1:54:11] now because jesus was the first son of
[1:54:14] god that was come to maturity to be in
[1:54:16] god he was plucked up from the earth and
[1:54:19] waved over the people

[2:01:48] it's the full listen for the first time
[2:01:52] for the bright age for resurrection out
[2:01:55] of dark denominationalism
[2:02:01] remember this is a resurrection
[2:02:06] this church is a people of the
[2:02:08] resurrection
[2:02:10] we were once in tombs of man
[2:02:15] bound by chains of darkness seals put
[2:02:18] upon our tomb
[2:02:22] but god didn't leave you that way
[2:02:25] hallelujah he sent an angel come on
[2:02:29] who rolled away the stone who broke off
[2:02:32] the chains of the ideals of man and
[2:02:35] opened it up where you can walk out
[2:02:39] not the same old dead corpse you were
[2:02:41] when you went in but with a new life
[2:02:44] never to die again
[2:02:49] hallelujah and he said because that i
[2:02:52] live you shall live also
[2:02:54] because i resurrected you will resurrect
[2:02:58] also
[2:02:59] he was speaking to his wife when he said
[2:03:01] that
[2:03:02] amen now what a resurrection that was 2
[2:03:04] 000 years ago can you say man
[2:03:07] but what a resurrection this is
[2:03:10] hallelujah to be made alive in jesus
[2:03:14] christ
[2:03:15] amen to be a living church
[2:03:18] to be a people there with the power of
[2:03:20] god
[2:03:21] now listen we can't just be a church in
[2:03:24] name only
[2:03:25] or the bride and name only it's kind of
[2:03:28] like his example of two cars
[2:03:31] coming down out of the assembly line
[2:03:33] both of them filled up with
[2:03:35] 98 octane gas and
[2:03:38] filled to the brim
[2:03:40] and they come out of the assembly line
[2:03:43] you know they've been pushed off this
[2:03:45] assembly line
[2:03:47] they
[2:03:48] they look alike but one don't have any
[2:03:50] spark
[2:03:52] no firing power
[2:03:54] so well we don't need fire and power but
[2:03:56] him there's power in the gasoline
[2:03:58] there's power in the word
[2:04:00] well no
[2:04:01] you see you have to have a spark
[2:04:04] or that or that gasoline might as well
[2:04:06] be water
[2:04:09] right amen in fact you won't know if
[2:04:11] it's gasoline or not until you spark it
[2:04:15] and no matter how much theologians claim
[2:04:18] how well we set our church in church
[2:04:21] order
[2:04:22] how much education we got where we can
[2:04:25] spend the bible and the message to and
[2:04:27] fro and back and forth and quote it and
[2:04:30] know and know everything but until that
[2:04:33] wave she that holy spirit
[2:04:35] comes upon that person to quicken that
[2:04:37] word
[2:04:39] amount without the spirit it will not
[2:04:42] move
[2:04:44] and that's the problem we we fill
[2:04:47] people's tanks with knowledge
[2:04:51] amen with it with word on top of word
[2:04:54] sermon on top of sermon
[2:04:57] until it just spills out
[2:04:59] till it's almost too much
[2:05:02] and the tank is filled up and running
[2:05:04] over a man they have a profession of
[2:05:07] faith but that faithful that car will
[2:05:10] not move down the road to overcoming
[2:05:13] power
[2:05:14] it has no power still over pornography
[2:05:17] or or you know steal social drinking
[2:05:20] wearing your swords
[2:05:23] and man acting like the world looking
[2:05:25] like the world doesn't have any power to
[2:05:28] give you power to rise up above sin
[2:05:31] amen because no matter how much words
[2:05:34] you have and how much truth you know and
[2:05:37] i'll you maybe you can sit on i i know
[2:05:39] young men that could sit on a bar stool
[2:05:42] in a bar and i'd argue anybody in the
[2:05:45] bar
[2:05:47] of their knowledge but that knowledge
[2:05:49] didn't do them any good
[2:05:51] if you can give them overcoming power of
[2:05:54] alcohol or drugs or sex sins
[2:05:58] come on amen to the world are you with
[2:06:01] me you didn't give them any power over
[2:06:03] it
[2:06:04] but i'm telling you friends the holy
[2:06:06] ghost comes upon the word
[2:06:09] amen what will it do it will ignite a
[2:06:11] power
[2:06:12] you can unleash the power of the word if
[2:06:16] you get the holy ghost in you and you
[2:06:18] can overcome any kind of sin that comes
[2:06:20] against you
[2:06:21] amen you can rise up above the sin of
[2:06:24] the world and you can fly like an eagle
[2:06:27] flies
[2:06:31] amen i want you to know something
[2:06:32] friends we didn't we didn't get left
[2:06:35] with a car that wouldn't ride
[2:06:37] it wouldn't run
[2:06:39] when brother branham left that car he
[2:06:41] left it
[2:06:42] running he didn't turn it off and say
[2:06:45] days of miracles are passed he left it
[2:06:48] running
[2:06:49] amen he left it and he showed it would
[2:06:52] drive to by divine healing it would
[2:06:55] drive to salvation it would drive to
[2:06:58] resurrection power
[2:07:00] amen it would take you somewhere
[2:07:03] amen but what we've had we've had men
[2:07:06] come along that fiddle battle and want
[2:07:08] to turn the key off
[2:07:10] don't know how to turn it back on and
[2:07:12] mess with the engine every kind of way
[2:07:14] and as brother branham said we put too
[2:07:17] much stress on the mechanics and not
[2:07:20] enough on the dynamics it needs the
[2:07:22] dynamic power of god the resurrection
[2:07:25] power of jesus christ upon the church to
[2:07:28] manifest and to prove that this is
[2:07:30] gasoline
[2:07:32] oh it's wonderful you're reading your
[2:07:34] bible i'm glad
[2:07:36] it's wonderful that you believe that
[2:07:38] it's the truth i'm glad but you got to
[2:07:41] get the holy ghost
[2:07:43] to come and ignite that word and make it
[2:07:45] live because there is a 10 000 octane
[2:07:50] power
[2:07:50] of the word of god and a holy ghost to
[2:07:53] light it up and to resurrect the power
[2:07:55] of god into a man's life or a woman's
[2:07:58] life or into a church that'll shed the
[2:08:01] cadillac right down the road under the
[2:08:03] dynamic power of god
[2:08:05] amen there we're without excuse
[2:08:08] now listen there's been many divorce
[2:08:11] churches churches brides brides churches
[2:08:14] bridesbrides
[2:08:16] but there's got to come one
[2:08:19] hallelujah there's got to come one
[2:08:22] listen god cannot give up on the project
[2:08:27] god cannot come and do what he's done in
[2:08:30] our age in this stop
[2:08:33] it has to
[2:08:34] progress come on
[2:08:37] amen he cannot do it
[2:08:39] he cannot just abandon the project he's
[2:08:42] got to finish it
[2:08:43] he's got to finish the work that we that
[2:08:45] he started
[2:08:47] now let's just look at this for a moment
[2:08:50] we
[2:08:51] are in an hour of darkness and great
[2:08:53] trouble and problems and it's war
[2:08:57] and it's not a war against flesh and
[2:08:59] blood but against principalities
[2:09:02] and powers in heavenly places in other
[2:09:05] words our word our war is against demons
[2:09:08] of every kind
[2:09:10] if we'd have read that revelation 12 we
[2:09:13] were to see the great battle between
[2:09:14] michael
[2:09:15] and
[2:09:16] lucifer and this was happening in our
[2:09:19] last day
[2:09:21] and so our our war is against demons of
[2:09:24] all ranks
[2:09:26] kinds and authorities
[2:09:28] they're attacking humans everywhere
[2:09:32] amen they and especially the children of
[2:09:34] god i mean come on you you know you've
[2:09:37] been under attack
[2:09:39] we've been under attack
[2:09:41] and we ask how can we defend ourselves
[2:09:44] against them or lead an assault on the
[2:09:47] armies of hell and deliver the captives
[2:09:52] you know the air itself is saturated
[2:09:55] with evil spirits that that seek to
[2:09:58] infest our bodies
[2:10:01] if you look in revelation 9 you would
[2:10:03] see that
[2:10:04] that the
[2:10:05] the gates or the lids of hell is opened
[2:10:08] up and it comes like a smoke out of the
[2:10:11] furnace and it is it is in philip
[2:10:15] infiltrated every crack and corner of
[2:10:19] our society
[2:10:28] it's there it's in the family life
[2:10:31] it's in your schools
[2:10:34] it's in the colleges
[2:10:36] this the demons have taken over
[2:10:39] our
[2:10:40] education
[2:10:42] they're teaching they're trying
[2:10:45] like they did in the days of moses
[2:10:48] you know where the pharaoh who didn't
[2:10:50] know joseph rises up and to kill the
[2:10:53] children
[2:10:55] and they're doing everything they can to
[2:10:57] destroy faith
[2:11:01] so all they you know their classes
[2:11:03] everything are stopped
[2:11:07] it's against our you know it is against
[2:11:10] the fibers of our country
[2:11:12] the morals of men and women
[2:11:17] and you think well brother tim i'm on
[2:11:18] the conservative side can you can you
[2:11:21] imagine you know you've got a guy that's
[2:11:23] supposed to be the conservative
[2:11:25] voice
[2:11:26] now sean hannity of the of the
[2:11:29] television and the conservative voice
[2:11:32] for all of us and for governor he brings
[2:11:34] bruce jenner on and calls him a great
[2:11:36] conservative
[2:11:41] because why it's infiltrated
[2:11:43] conservativism
[2:11:46] it's infiltrated the republican party
[2:11:49] the democrats
[2:11:51] it's infiltrated in fact they're all
[2:11:53] giving their mind to the beast
[2:11:56] they're all beginning to think the same
[2:11:58] way
[2:11:59] and you want to think oh there's some
[2:12:01] differences here and differences there
[2:12:03] but let me tell you it's sin is
[2:12:05] abounding
[2:12:07] like never before
[2:12:10] are you with me
[2:12:11] amen and and let me just tell you it's
[2:12:14] just saturating the air around us
[2:12:18] there's a heaviness
[2:12:20] amen just like they were on the road to
[2:12:22] emmaus you know in a moment when god's
[2:12:25] doing mighty things
[2:12:28] and in that moment
[2:12:30] there's death around
[2:12:32] trouble
[2:12:33] calamities
[2:12:35] seemed like unanswered prayers
[2:12:37] we prayed and prayed and we prayed and
[2:12:40] didn't get answered the way we thought
[2:12:48] are you with me now
[2:12:50] you don't think spirits don't try to
[2:12:52] settle over a crowd or over people
[2:12:55] do you think that the devil won't try to
[2:12:57] use
[2:12:58] current events things that's happened in
[2:13:00] the last little while things that you're
[2:13:02] dealing with and heard about and things
[2:13:04] has happened in your own assembly and
[2:13:06] among your loved ones and even to
[2:13:08] even even to the pastor's wife you don't
[2:13:11] think spirits won't try to settle over a
[2:13:14] crowd of people during a battle like we
[2:13:17] have and don't you don't do do you not
[2:13:19] know that unbelief is going to do its
[2:13:21] best to raise its ugly head
[2:13:25] amen but i want to remind you
[2:13:29] that you can't lose
[2:13:33] even in death you can't lose
[2:13:39] yet some of us will still go by the way
[2:13:41] of the grave
[2:13:42] amen but but that's no lack of faith
[2:13:46] amen the list of the hebrews are the
[2:13:48] heroes of faith in hebrews 11 said these
[2:13:52] all died in faith
[2:13:54] they were believing
[2:14:02] unbelief will try to raise this ugly
[2:14:04] head

[2:14:30] you know that there's no god
[2:14:32] and i just turned back to him and said
[2:14:34] well
[2:14:36] satan
[2:14:37] if there is no god there is no devil
[2:14:41] so you don't exist
[2:14:48] but i know there's a god
[2:14:50] i know he's answered prayer
[2:14:52] i know he's delivered his people
[2:14:55] i know i can see it in lives
[2:14:59] i can see him go out there and take a
[2:15:01] boy that's in his pajamas and drag him
[2:15:04] all the way to the church down to an
[2:15:06] altar

[2:15:30] and a few months ago that was impossible
[2:15:33] but god took a boy who had been a drunk
[2:15:36] all his life and in dope and other
[2:15:38] things and all kinds of sin i don't know
[2:15:40] what all but in a moment's time changed

[2:16:12] and with his stripes we're healed oh god
[2:16:14] i believe that
[2:16:15] i believe these people are reaching
[2:16:18] forward through that misgender
[2:16:21] on beyond that little dark spell
[2:16:24] over that cloud just beyond that star
[2:16:26] yonder
[2:16:27] until their prayers are climbing now
[2:16:29] around the throne of god
[2:16:31] hallelujah
[2:16:33] oh my don't stop now
[2:16:35] and then lord is your prophet standing
[2:16:37] between the living and the dead anointed
[2:16:39] by the holy spirit i go forward to
[2:16:41] challenge any spirit of doubt that would
[2:16:43] be here and that the children of god
[2:16:46] might be healed
[2:16:47] now satan

[2:16:52] question mark across the word of god you

[2:17:24] priest standing between the living and
[2:17:26] the dead i say in the name of jesus
[2:17:29] christ i break your powers and leave it

[2:17:50] cloud of the devil
[2:17:52] sitting right there brian telling you
[2:17:54] this ain't for you that god that don't
[2:17:57] care about you that you prayed many
[2:17:59] prayers and it don't seem like they're
[2:18:01] going to be answered
[2:18:03] but i want you to know amen there is a
[2:18:06] god who answers
[2:18:08] and a god who said you haven't crossed
[2:18:11] the line
[2:18:12] amen that there is still hope and there
[2:18:14] is your mercy and there is still grace
[2:18:17] hallelujah but the holy ghost is for
[2:18:20] everyone the lord our god shall
[2:18:22] call hallelujah you don't have to
[2:18:25] believe the lie of the devil
[2:18:27] you can choose to believe it or you can
[2:18:30] choose to believe god's word i choose to
[2:18:32] believe god's word
[2:18:35] hallelujah i choose not to live defeated
[2:18:38] i choose not to be depressed i choose
[2:18:41] not to retreat or to back up i choose
[2:18:45] life i choose to go forward i choose to
[2:18:48] speak his name i choose
[2:19:00] you know what depression is is a devil
[2:19:02] cloud in your mind
[2:19:03] he lies to you
[2:19:05] he tries to make the words of the
[2:19:07] adversary greater than the words of god
[2:19:11] and you forget
[2:19:12] that more powerful is great or greater
[2:19:15] is he that is in you than he that's in
[2:19:17] the world
[2:19:20] dark spirits
[2:19:23] shadows of worry
[2:19:25] dark spirits of gloom
[2:19:28] veils of depression
[2:19:30] i'll not have none of it
[2:19:33] ephesians 6 12 we wrestle not against
[2:19:35] flesh and blood but against
[2:19:36] principalities against powers
[2:19:39] and rulers of the darkness of this world
[2:19:42] against spiritual wickedness in high
[2:19:44] places
[2:19:46] let me give you one example this is a
[2:19:48] prayer line
[2:19:50] brother branham says to this man i i see
[2:19:52] what's wrong with you

[2:19:56] nearly to get well haven't you

[2:20:02] nerve condition in that right that's
[2:20:04] right nothing can help you you've been
[2:20:06] given up but jesus will help you now
[2:20:08] do you believe me brother you believe it
[2:20:10] will you obey me as a servant
[2:20:12] now you want to be healthy and have that
[2:20:15] weary and gloomy and crazy feeling like
[2:20:17] you've been losing your mind and things
[2:20:19] like that i'll tell you where it started
[2:20:21] on the prostate
[2:20:23] and what really is doing it is a demon
[2:20:26] and it haunts you
[2:20:28] isn't it right you have no peace all at
[2:20:30] all day and night it's after you it
[2:20:32] seems like you just get gloomy feelings
[2:20:34] in there isn't that right yes or worry
[2:20:37] don't sleep nervous getting up at night
[2:20:40] let's bow our heads together our
[2:20:42] heavenly father they aren't here to
[2:20:44] bless my brother o thou son of god who
[2:20:46] is able to reveal the very thoughts of
[2:20:48] our heart
[2:20:49] able to do all things free this poor
[2:20:52] caged mortal
[2:20:53] in a cage now that he can't free himself
[2:20:56] like an eagle in a cage beating his
[2:20:59] wings until his weary eyes fall backward
[2:21:02] oh father be merciful to him
[2:21:05] thou servant knows that what he's
[2:21:06] suffering not demon tormenting this life
[2:21:09] in the name of jesus christ the son of
[2:21:11] god come out of the man

[2:21:17] feel all right now fine wonderful go out
[2:21:20] rejoice and testify now i can tell you
[2:21:22] what happened to you when you was a
[2:21:23] little boy down to the age right down
[2:21:25] where you are now the life that you live
[2:21:27] the things you've done that was true
[2:21:28] wasn't it everywhere true now i tell you
[2:21:31] what will be the results in the coming
[2:21:33] future
[2:21:34] go out of here happy
[2:21:36] singing
[2:21:37] testifying
[2:21:39] telling people god healed you
[2:21:41] forget you was ever nervous 30 days from
[2:21:44] now you'll be a different man altogether
[2:21:48] amen what was it it was an ugly
[2:21:50] depressing spirit that was dealt with
[2:21:54] and the atmosphere was changed
[2:21:58] amen why because if you can get people
[2:22:01] thinking right
[2:22:03] amen the right mental attitude
[2:22:06] you see
[2:22:08] nobody can be saved
[2:22:10] nobody can be saved until
[2:22:13] they believe that he is
[2:22:16] not that he was
[2:22:18] but that he
[2:22:20] is and that he is a rewarder of those
[2:22:24] that diligently seek him
[2:22:28] amen nobody can be saved until they
[2:22:30] believe he is
[2:22:33] that he still says that he still
[2:22:35] delivers that he still heals
[2:22:40] amen you must believe he is and
[2:22:43] that he'll reward me for diligently
[2:22:46] seeking
[2:22:47] what is i'm not going to give up i'm
[2:22:50] going to knock and keep on knocking i'm
[2:22:52] going to ask and keep on asking i'm
[2:22:54] going to seek and keep on seeking i'm
[2:22:57] not backing up
[2:22:59] hey man if the door seems closed i'm
[2:23:01] going to knock again
[2:23:03] amen i'm gonna knock till it's open
[2:23:07] amen god's not gonna get any rest until
[2:23:10] he hears me
[2:23:14] amen that's where he taught us to come
[2:23:18] see your mental attitude has got to be
[2:23:19] right
[2:23:21] unless you believe the promise is for
[2:23:22] you it ain't
[2:23:24] right
[2:23:24] it's only for believers
[2:23:27] when you start believing it's yours
[2:23:30] but as long as you wallow in your
[2:23:31] unbelief and your doubts and whatever is
[2:23:33] never going to be yours
[2:23:35] you've got to confess it
[2:23:37] it's mine
[2:23:38] i want it i want it for myself i want it
[2:23:41] for my life
[2:23:44] so your mental attitude has to be right
[2:23:46] because satan knows even if you start
[2:23:49] believing mentally
[2:23:51] he's got to go
[2:23:53] the bible said in isaiah 26 and 3 that
[2:23:56] will keep him in perfect peace whose
[2:23:58] mind is stayed on thee because he trusts
[2:24:01] in thee
[2:24:02] trust ye in the lord forever
[2:24:04] for the lord jehovah is everlasting
[2:24:07] strength
[2:24:08] second timothy 1 and 7 for god has not
[2:24:11] given us the spirit of fear but a power
[2:24:13] and of love and a sound mind
[2:24:16] you see fear is a spirit of bondage
[2:24:20] and you cannot be a messiah an anointed
[2:24:23] one and be also anointed with fear
[2:24:27] you've got to let the holy spirit anoint
[2:24:29] you
[2:24:31] you see fear is a spirit of bondage it's
[2:24:33] a spirit of control
[2:24:36] you know
[2:24:36] you know as as brother branham would
[2:24:39] often say about this he said i'm trying
[2:24:41] to show people they don't have any need
[2:24:43] of being scared
[2:24:45] the worst thing the devil can put on you
[2:24:47] is fear
[2:24:48] if you had cancer and you didn't fear
[2:24:50] and believe god would heal you you
[2:24:51] wouldn't be in too bad of shape
[2:24:54] god could take care of that if you're
[2:24:55] sick whatever it is if you didn't fear
[2:24:57] so fear is one of the worst things satan
[2:24:59] can place on upon the person
[2:25:02] and i've tried to prove by the scripture
[2:25:04] that man is born again the man that's
[2:25:06] born again and the kingdom of god has
[2:25:08] nothing to fear you're absolutely safely
[2:25:11] secure in jesus christ all that the
[2:25:14] father hath given me will come no man
[2:25:16] can come unless the father calls him and
[2:25:18] the father's got to lead him up to me
[2:25:21] and and he
[2:25:22] he comes to me i will in no wise cast
[2:25:25] him out no man can pluck him out of my
[2:25:27] father's hand no one is man is greater
[2:25:29] than he is
[2:25:32] you say brother tim i'm trying and i've
[2:25:34] tried and i'm trying to find god
[2:25:38] i'll tell you what i'm quit trying to
[2:25:39] find god he's not lost
[2:25:44] i mean you're the one that's lost
[2:25:47] oh man you need to say god find me
[2:25:50] because no man seeketh after god is
[2:25:53] really god's seeking man
[2:25:55] and if there's a hunger in your heart at
[2:25:57] all for god it shows that there's a god
[2:25:59] that is seeking you
[2:26:02] hallelujah and he's not gonna leave you
[2:26:04] alone he'll meet you in the night he'll
[2:26:08] meet you in the morning he'll meet you
[2:26:10] at a car wreck he'll meet you there at a
[2:26:12] funeral he'll meet you in a church
[2:26:14] service he'll meet you anywhere but he
[2:26:17] ain't gonna lose one of his he will seek
[2:26:19] after them and he'll find them surely
[2:26:22] goodness and mercy shall follow me all
[2:26:25] the days of my life and i will dwell in
[2:26:27] the house of the lord
[2:26:29] forever
[2:26:33] just look what the fear of covet did
[2:26:36] it brought to halt mighty economies
[2:26:39] it shut down churches
[2:26:41] it stopped governments
[2:26:43] fear took away freedoms
[2:26:46] fear took a mate stalwart christians
[2:26:48] stay away from church and hide in their
[2:26:50] homes
[2:26:52] governments then use the fear of kobe to
[2:26:54] control populists
[2:26:56] take away their liberty and their
[2:26:58] freedoms
[2:27:00] but there's got to be somebody
[2:27:03] i wonder if you'll be one of those
[2:27:04] somebodies
[2:27:06] someone that the resurrected christ has
[2:27:08] stepped forward
[2:27:09] in their life
[2:27:11] and says fear not
[2:27:13] he the resurrected one saying out of
[2:27:16] your life fear not
[2:27:18] i am he that was dead
[2:27:20] and behold i am alive forevermore and i
[2:27:24] have the keys of death and hell
[2:27:27] it's resurrection our church is where
[2:27:30] michael stands up
[2:27:32] and when he does he finds the names of
[2:27:35] those that are in the book
[2:27:37] amen and he there in that moment in time
[2:27:40] brings a resurrection
[2:27:42] and the wise understand and know their
[2:27:44] god and man it's resurrection our church
[2:27:48] it's a time where god is transforming
[2:27:50] lives moving in his church working in
[2:27:53] his people
[2:27:55] hallelujah bringing deliverance
[2:27:57] everywhere
[2:28:01] he's here
[2:28:03] where is he
[2:28:04] he's got a voice on earth
[2:28:06] what is that voice you're the voice of
[2:28:08] the resurrection
[2:28:12] amen the voice of the archangel
[2:28:15] the voice of the resurrection
[2:28:18] what is it
[2:28:19] you know
[2:28:20] as brother brandon told us for the first
[2:28:23] time for the bride age for resurrection
[2:28:25] out of dark denominationalism will be a
[2:28:28] message
[2:28:29] that the full maturity of the word has
[2:28:31] returned again in its full power being
[2:28:33] waved over the people you talk about the
[2:28:35] message
[2:28:36] what is the message
[2:28:38] a lot of people don't have a clue what
[2:28:39] the message is about that's right
[2:28:42] that the full the message is
[2:28:45] the message hear me out in the in the
[2:28:47] land the message
[2:28:49] is that the full
[2:28:51] maturity of the word has returned in its
[2:28:54] full power with the same signs and
[2:28:57] wonders that he did back there
[2:29:00] that's the message
[2:29:03] amen that's the crux of the whole thing
[2:29:06] that christ is here where
[2:29:09] in his people
[2:29:14] say well
[2:29:16] we're people of the full maturity of the
[2:29:18] word then words of full power with the
[2:29:19] signs and wonders that he did
[2:29:22] now
[2:29:24] let me just bring it down
[2:29:26] and i'm closing with this
[2:29:28] you see the world is doing everything
[2:29:32] to keep christ dead
[2:29:37] churches are producing religions with a
[2:29:40] dead christ
[2:29:42] we preached christ crucified
[2:29:46] he died for us
[2:29:50] and they're trying to keep him in a tomb
[2:29:52] that's right
[2:29:54] they're happy with him dead
[2:29:58] there's a lot of message churches you're
[2:29:59] happy with him dead too
[2:30:02] you don't want him in your service you
[2:30:04] don't want him anointing songs
[2:30:06] you don't want him in worship
[2:30:09] you don't want him even an anointed
[2:30:10] preaching just dry
[2:30:12] you know and even in salvation dried out
[2:30:14] confessions
[2:30:17] man they just wanted dead a dead farm
[2:30:20] we've had enough of dead floors
[2:30:23] we've had thousands of years now of the
[2:30:26] dead funds
[2:30:28] dead creeds
[2:30:29] dogmas of man
[2:30:31] producing dead people
[2:30:35] people still dead in their sins and
[2:30:37] trespasses preachers in the pulpit
[2:30:40] homosexuals dead
[2:30:44] amen perverts dead
[2:30:47] womanizers dead
[2:30:49] deacon boards dead
[2:30:51] church is dead
[2:30:57] why because
[2:30:58] they want to keep him dead
[2:31:02] i got news for you my wife isn't dead
[2:31:06] she's more alive than she ever was
[2:31:09] and not only
[2:31:10] not only what she
[2:31:12] healed she got a greater healing than
[2:31:14] ever
[2:31:20] my last conversation that i would have
[2:31:22] with her
[2:31:23] i would ask her karen are you ready to
[2:31:26] meet the lord i said i believe i know
[2:31:27] that answer but i just want to hear you
[2:31:29] say it she said oh yes tim
[2:31:31] i'm ready to meet him
[2:31:35] i said a year ago we were here karen
[2:31:38] this very same place
[2:31:41] the doctors had given you up and said
[2:31:42] you wouldn't live
[2:31:45] god's given us another year it's been a
[2:31:47] miracle
[2:31:51] i said we had 44 years of marriage then
[2:31:54] and i told timothy as we sat in the
[2:31:57] early morning son
[2:31:59] this is it
[2:32:02] if today is the day
[2:32:05] i have no regrets
[2:32:08] i said karen we're here now a year later
[2:32:10] and we've had 45 years of marriage
[2:32:13] and i still say we have no regrets
[2:32:18] i have none
[2:32:19] no regrets
[2:32:22] what about you she said tim
[2:32:24] i've had a good life
[2:32:26] i've had a wonderful marriage
[2:32:28] yes
[2:32:30] i have no regrets
[2:32:36] but today
[2:32:37] she's a young woman again
[2:32:44] she has escaped beyond
[2:32:47] the powers of death and what sickness
[2:32:50] can do
[2:32:51] into an immortal body
[2:32:53] that can never perish or fade away
[2:32:57] and a world is more real than this world
[2:33:01] and how do you even know that world is
[2:33:03] there because i've heard from that world
[2:33:06] and his transforming power changed my
[2:33:08] life
[2:33:10] you say but this is nothing but just
[2:33:12] another cult brother jim this is a cult
[2:33:14] that's all it is is a cult and a cult
[2:33:17] worship and a cult following well i'll
[2:33:19] tell you what a cult that will change a
[2:33:21] life
[2:33:23] let it take a george winters
[2:33:26] amen to take his little wife trisha
[2:33:28] who's right now both of them are sick at
[2:33:30] home but his wife trisha they're a chain
[2:33:33] smoker
[2:33:34] there couldn't give him up a mother who
[2:33:37] never could give them up
[2:33:39] a chain smoker
[2:33:41] addicted
[2:33:43] held in bondage
[2:33:45] and there one moment
[2:33:48] and god's presence
[2:33:50] took away the desire forever
[2:33:56] what is it we've heard from another
[2:33:58] world
[2:33:59] man can't do that
[2:34:12] what has happened here a.a couldn't do
[2:34:17] the pledges the promises
[2:34:20] the remembrance i you know i'll always
[2:34:21] turn to the bottle for dependence when i
[2:34:23] get in a crisis
[2:34:26] but when god comes he takes away every
[2:34:28] desire of it
[2:34:36] you see
[2:34:37] we were in a horrible condition
[2:34:40] mankind was lost
[2:34:42] men would go down the grave for they're
[2:34:44] never to rise again
[2:34:47] until jesus came
[2:34:51] when he came he said
[2:34:54] because i live you will live also
[2:34:58] you know what a resurrection that was
[2:35:00] but then what a resurrection this is
[2:35:03] listen
[2:35:05] closing with this
[2:35:07] and today they're trying to keep christ
[2:35:09] in a tomb
[2:35:11] and they are
[2:35:13] but oh what an easter morning did and
[2:35:15] easter morning ruined all their theology
[2:35:20] when easter morning came for people here
[2:35:22] a church and 1900 years later and and it
[2:35:26] ruined their theology he's not dead he's
[2:35:29] alive forevermore and they can't keep
[2:35:31] him in nope tomb
[2:35:34] you can put him in a methodist tomb a
[2:35:36] baptist tomb or presbyterian tomb or
[2:35:38] whatever you want to but he raised out
[2:35:41] of that tomb
[2:35:42] and he's alive today he said i had a
[2:35:45] baptist tomb you might have had a
[2:35:47] methodist tube but one day jesus rose
[2:35:50] from there
[2:35:51] from a hysterical god to a living
[2:35:55] present god alive forevermore
[2:36:00] hallelujah and he rose out of there our
[2:36:03] people in this day he we raised up out
[2:36:06] of creeds of man
[2:36:08] out of tombs of religion
[2:36:11] and we will never be sealed back in
[2:36:13] there again
[2:36:22] and because he lives
[2:36:26] i live also
[2:36:30] resurrection life
[2:36:32] is within us
[2:36:36] let me buy let me ask you to bow your
[2:36:38] head for a moment
[2:36:42] maybe you're in a tomb of no religion
[2:36:50] haunted there with doubts
[2:36:52] fears
[2:36:54] unbelief darkness
[2:37:00] the tomb is sealed there's no light
[2:37:05] the casket is locked
[2:37:09] darkness
[2:37:12] maybe satan's locked locked your
[2:37:15] casket
[2:37:17] you're sealed away in a tomb
[2:37:20] maybe every kind of unbelief imaginable
[2:37:24] holding you bound maybe sins of the past
[2:37:28] spirits of darkness of your of your past
[2:37:32] is holding you back
[2:37:36] but i'm here to say you don't have to
[2:37:38] stay dead
[2:37:43] jesus came to give life and life more
[2:37:45] abundantly
[2:37:47] you can have that abundant life today
[2:37:52] maybe maybe your
[2:37:54] maybe your praises that you have is this
[2:37:57] formal and
[2:37:58] it's as cold as a cold hand and a grave
[2:38:02] maybe
[2:38:03] maybe you're maybe you're
[2:38:06] your life your spiritual life oh come on
[2:38:10] don't call yourself a christian and
[2:38:12] you're committing fornication
[2:38:15] don't call yourself a christian you're
[2:38:17] living a life of sin and
[2:38:19] still in alcohol and
[2:38:23] other things drugs and fornication
[2:38:25] filthiness of the flesh don't call
[2:38:27] yourself a christian
[2:38:29] you're not a christian you're still dead
[2:38:37] but you can have a resurrection today
[2:38:41] you don't have to continue in the life
[2:38:43] of sin
[2:38:45] today sin can stop here
[2:38:49] brother tim i didn't understand
[2:38:50] everything you said just understand this
[2:38:52] part
[2:39:00] when the prodigal son came to jesus
[2:39:03] or came to the father
[2:39:07] he said my son which was dead is alive
[2:39:10] again
[2:39:19] what about you
[2:39:26] what about you
[2:39:35] some of
[2:39:36] you right now
[2:39:40] have stepped over into a bottomless pit
[2:39:48] you can't get back
[2:39:51] and you try and you try and you can't
[2:39:53] get back
[2:39:58] so i'm going to do good and you just
[2:40:02] try your best to get up
[2:40:04] again and you just fall again
[2:40:06] deeper and down you go
[2:40:11] you're just turning over and over and
[2:40:13] over
[2:40:16] so then i'm hopeless brother tim you've
[2:40:18] already gotten me into hell
[2:40:20] yeah you are in hell
[2:40:24] but you see right now
[2:40:27] there is that hand of mercy that can
[2:40:29] reach right out
[2:40:31] when you cry out to him lord god save me
[2:40:34] i perish
[2:40:36] and reach out and catch you
[2:40:38] and stop the fall
[2:40:40] and take you and put your feet on a
[2:40:42] solid rock
[2:40:44] on solid ground
[2:40:47] you don't have to continue the fall
[2:40:48] trend
[2:40:50] you can be changed
[2:41:00] maybe the holy spirit just speak into
[2:41:02] your heart today
[2:41:03] there's some little something down
[2:41:06] i believe god is real
[2:41:10] like i told william butts the other days
[2:41:13] when he told me
[2:41:14] tim
[2:41:15] i want to call you
[2:41:17] i want to tell you
[2:41:19] i got the holy ghost i said son is real
[2:41:22] he said yes sir it's so real
[2:41:26] it's not a fantasy it's not a fake
[2:41:30] it's a reality of the living god
[2:41:34] won't you let him change your life today
[2:41:36] in his presence
[2:41:38] while there's still mercy while there's
[2:41:40] still grace
[2:41:43] like when i said to my wife the other
[2:41:45] day honey we don't know when the lord
[2:41:47] might call
[2:41:49] i don't know darling
[2:41:50] he may call me before he calls you i
[2:41:52] don't know
[2:41:55] but here we are in the hospital
[2:41:58] are you ready to meet him
[2:42:01] i know the answer but will you just tell
[2:42:03] me
[2:42:04] how you feel in your heart
[2:42:08] she could look at me
[2:42:09] with a clear mind and say yes tim
[2:42:14] i'm ready to meet him
[2:42:19] are you ready to meet him
[2:42:26] are you ready to meet him
[2:42:28] he's calling your name today
[2:42:31] speaking to you

[2:42:36] would that just be somebody here that
[2:42:38] would just lift a hand to god and say

[2:43:14] and that but i i realized today i need
[2:43:18] a real baptism of the holy ghost in my
[2:43:21] life
[2:43:24] i'm asking jesus to come to me god bless
[2:43:26] you sir he sees your hand
