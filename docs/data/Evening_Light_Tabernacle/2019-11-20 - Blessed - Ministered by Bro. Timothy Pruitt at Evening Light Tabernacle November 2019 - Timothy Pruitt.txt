precious faith and more just have this sanctuary Lord to just worship you and get away from the thoughts of tomorrow and today and yesterday and Lord just think on you to think about your goodness to think about your grace your mercy that's brought us through God where would it be be with it wasn't for you and your love that you bestowed on us tonight father we just commit this service in your hands besides that you would touch us Lord by your grace in Jesus name Amen amen we could turn our Bibles to Deuteronomy 28 amen it's always good to be in the house of the Lord Amen I'd like to echo that what brother James and his prayer city as David said it was I was glad when they said unto me hey man I don't know about you but I wake up happy on the Sunday morning to be able to go to the house of the Lord on the Wednesday to just take a moment to amen to get away from the pressures of this world and just let him go for a little while amen they'll be there tomorrow Amen but let tomorrow take care of itself amen and speaking of tomorrow I'll be leaving to go to North Carolina to preach for brother Josh Bennett this weekend so just be praying for me amen the Lord just help us in those services Deuteronomy 28 and verse 1 he men this is just incredible reading of Scripture and he said it shall come to pass if thou shalt hearken diligently to the voice of the LORD thy God to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day that the Lord thy God will set the on high above all nations of the earth and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee and if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God blessed shalt thou be in the city and blessed shalt thou be in the field blessed shall be the fruit of that body and the fruit of that ground and the fruit of that cattle and the increase of that kind and the flocks of that sheep blessed shall be that basket in our store blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out and the Lord shall calls on enemies to rise up against thee and to be smitten before thy face they shall come out against the one way and flee before these seven ways and the Lord shall command the blessing upon thee and thy storehouses and in all that thou settest on Hanan - and he shall bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee and the Lord shall establish thee holy people unto himself as he has sworn unto thee if thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God and walk in his ways and all people the earth shall see thee see that thou art called by the name of the Lord and they shall be afraid of thee and the Lord shall make the plenteous in goods and the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy cattle and the fruit of that ground in the land which the Lord swear unto thy father's to give thee and the Lord shall open unto thee his good treasure the heaven to the heaven to give the rain unto thy land and it's seasons his season and to bless all the work of thine hand and thou shalt Lindon the many nations and shalt thou shalt not borrow and the Lord shall make thee the head and not the tail and thou shalt be above only and thou shalt not be beneath and if that if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the LORD thy God which I command thee this day to observe and to do them amen god bless you this evening I this subject is so vast it's you couldn't take one service and preach all of the scriptures that contain it and no doubt would take the rest of our lives and I don't know maybe we'll go a few services on it not sure but like to speak to your own blessed own bless you know if we kept reading the scripture here you could actually go home and read this later tonight and you'd find out that the same blessings would come by listening or heeding to the word curses would follow if they didn't follow his word and His commandments and you know after reading all of the blessings you would wonder why they wouldn't heed to the word of God but tonight you know I'm not going to read the curses because I'm not speaking to a curse people hey man I'm speaking to a people who have listened or heated God's Word I believe I'm speaking to those who do what His Word says and as you do you will be overtaken by his blessings that just struck me very deeply to be overtaken as to as one would be you know be chased after or to be to run after these blessings or the God's blessing is to overtake you you know you know and as we know it dealt with Israel you know on a natural or physical basis it was a physical land his brother Tim spoke about even Sunday also had a physical enemy in it and and but with us you know it's a spiritual land it's a spiritual enemy it's not flesh and blood that we face but it's principalities and powers but and you know and and he blesses us not so much in a physical manner although there are blessings that he bestows on us as a and that our physical and and and blessings but I believe that the blessings that we are to desire is not just a physical blessing but also our spiritual blessings amen physical blessings are temporary amen you know you can get a new job you know people post things you know we live in a day of posts you know it's not a fence post but it's a Facebook post or Instagram post or Twitter or whatever you know when they do these hashtags know much about them but you know got a new job and they use the hashtag blessed or got a pay raise bless got a new job or a new house or new car bless but you know Butler Brandon was saying spiritual amnesia said not always prosperity is a sign of a spiritual blessing but sometimes it's contrary said people think maybe you have a lot of old a lot of worldly goods and that shows that God is blessing you he said that's not always true sometimes it's the other way so we know we're not to longer to just look at a temporary blessing but God has something so much greater than that and and although you know these temporary blessings are needful amen and and we're thankful for every blessing that God gives us we're thankful for a car or a house or money to to pay our bills and all those things but to be truly blessed and I I did look up the definition of blessed and it really shocked me what bless really means you know and and if we're not careful we get the idea as we spoke you know speaking about a blessed means you know that just a carnal thinking of the word blessed but even the dictionary you know what the dictionary's definition for blessed is number one made holy consecrating Wow Amen number two one who God extends his benefits to number three endowed with divine favor and protection amen number four those who go to live in heaven with God that's the kind of blessed I want to be a man not necessarily looking for things here on this earth and no those things are necessary some and and you know but I'm talking about a blessed people and listen you don't have to be in the United States to be this kind of blessed people amen you might have to be in the United State you know people there's many people in the world that would trade places with the poorest among us in a heartbeat amen but that's not the blessings that I'm talking about but this definition you can be this kind of blessed person no matter where you live and I believe this is the one we ought to strive after and when we want to long Devoran what we're looking to be is a blessed person wholly consecrated a blessed person one who God extends his benefits to even a blessed person one who's endowed with divine favor and protection that's the blessings I want amen amen a blessed person those who go to live with God in heaven Oh hallelujah and I want to look at some of our blessings tonight in Ephesians one and verse three he says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ so spiritual blessing that's what we're longing for that's what we're looking for according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love have you seen any blessings yet Amen one chosen before the foundations of the world that's a blessing a man is a blessing in other words we are not an accident Amen God has been planning your coming and he's been planning your going your destiny before he ever said let there be light he had already blessed you he met his blessings was already upon you before he ever said let there be light amen he was already Amen planned you're already was there as he told the children of Israel I'll make you the head and not the tail I'll make you had to be the man at the top and our above and not beneath so he already has pretended destinated you to the place where you belong a member for you everything there ever was a let there be he meant God already had you in his mind and number two holy and then placed you there and not to be a a wrecker or not to be a down trodden somebody but to be holy and blameless amen blameless wants something that nobody or anybody no devil can find any fault in it God Himself can't find fault he meant no shame on us amen amen verse 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself amen according to the good pleasure of his will predestinated us to adoption he predetermined or beforehand that we are his mercy that's blessed before the foundation of the world he said you're mine that's enough to walk out of here blessed tonight to realize I've never did belong to the devil he had me in his pawnshop he had me talked into another life but that's not who I was I was predetermined by God before the foundation of the world therefore I'm blessed he already made his decision about you and he cannot change it we're blessed and I he already made the decision amen to the praise and glory of His grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved accepted not rejected not set-aside not abandoned but highly favored examined with grace compassed with favor and honored with blessings mercy are you blessed yet in whom we have redemption through his blood and the forgiveness of sin according to the riches of His grace redemption through his blood our freedom is paid for he said we could go free amen I'm just reading your will tonight I'm reading your blessings they man forgiveness of sin justified as though you never done it in the first place we are a blessed people amen the Bible said it will get too blessed as a man whom God does not impute sin hey man and forgiveness of sin and we have received the riches of His grace not as judgment but its grace unmerited favor abounding grace overflowing running over beyond measure we're in here the bounded towards us in all wisdom and prudence having made known the mystery of his will there's another blessing according to his good pleasure which is purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things into Christ both which are in heaven and which on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance all glory to God you have been given an inheritance amen you know I I'm saying I think I've told this story before but here's some time we've been many years ago when I was doing some remodeling for a lady actually me and brother Joseph wouldn't even and was looking at giving her a bid on a job and and it was during his time of transition when he'd go back to to Canada there before he moved down and so we wouldn't place the bid you know and the lady said oh it looks pretty good I get back with you and he went to Canada and so she called me said I'd like to talk to you something's happened so I know what I don't know I mean we hadn't agreed to anything I don't know what's happened we get there and she says I want to redo the whole place so he's talking about just a kitchen you know or something like that so I want to redo it all and I said okay she says you're not gonna believe what happened since I went to my cousin's reading of the wheel and sitting hi my name was on it so I get called to the to the whatever they could call that and then to the reading of the wheel and and I didn't even know didn't know him I knew him was good friends but I had no clue the man had the money that he has and she said I was left with this sum of money and I want to put it into my house and and she said I just sat there dumbfounded I said yeah I'd like to kind of know how that felt amen but you know III look at that and all of a sudden now all the money's gone in this sentence he may have a new house but one day to get old again and out of date and all this and it's just a temporary inheritance but what he is talking about is an eternal inheritance it's an eternal thing that we're speaking about that's why we can say we're blessed not blessed with a million dollars that'll be here tomorrow and go on the next few weeks but got an eternal inheritance a new body Oh glory to God amen things that don't mouths don't decay don't grow old and don't rot away when eternal inheritance that we should be for the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ and whom he also after that you heard the word of truth so another blessing we heard the word of truth that's a blessing do you know how many years I've heard the truth but yet didn't hear the truth why would he make this statement he that hath an ear let him to hear I mean every person in this building got ears but not every person that comes in this building hears come on somebody a man it's a blessing to be able to hear the word of truth Amen I want to be I mean we ought to be on the edge of our seat this is more than just a temporary blessing how much smarter would be on the edge of our seat we was at a reading of a wheel and somebody was telling us you inherited this and you got that you got two million dollars you got this maybe we build the engine or see what's next come on somebody and we call ourself blessed and we hear the word of truth service after cert we ought to be on the edge of our seats why because I'm blessed because God has given me not just the ability to hear but the ability to receive the word and his word is a light unto my path therefore I'm blessed because I'm not in darkness he has called me out of darkness into a marvelous life therefore I'm blessed and we have sealed us with the holy spirit of promise glory to God which is the earnest of our inheritance it's only the beginning this is only the beginning is that we've had wonderful services I've felt the presence of God and God has come down and healed us he's come down and delivered this is only the beginning [Music] it's just a downpayment of our inheritance it's just the foretaste of glory divine get ready we're gonna receive it all [Applause] hallelujah he meant sealed with the holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance on to the redemption of the purchased possession of the praise of his glory wherefore also after I've heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and loving all the saints cease not to give things making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him blessed and the eyes of you understand him being lightened blessed that you might know what is the hope of his calling blessed and what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance of the saints blessed and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us who believed blessed amen that on the eyes of understanding the hope of his calling the riches of His grace is poured on by the exceeding greatness of his power what kind of power are we talking about we're talking about more than more power than catch you here to church more than the power that gets the airplane off the ground we're talking about the power of Christ that raised a dead cold body out of the grave that power is what's going to change our bodies that power is what heals our sick blessed he means what he says which he wrought in Christ which he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in heavenly places far above principalities and power might and Dominion ever named this name not only in this world but also that which is to come and has put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is body fullness of him they'll fill it all in all and you hath he quickened I mean bless people we got here tonight and you hath he quickened who were dead and such were some of you who are dead in trespasses and sins you know some people come to church and all that's been out in the world and they think they're amongst a bunch of holy people and they are but we wasn't always holy people come on somebody we too were dead in trespasses and sins he said I had never been out there you were still dead you was born in this world speaking lies chapter in iniquity you were dead they met in trespasses and sin but you are not dead no more because he has made us alive in Christ Jesus bless people we're in times past Oh blurring of God I got a pass but it's in the past and the past is not my present nor my future we're blessed amen according to the course of this world according to the Prince of the power of the air of the spirit now I'm not working than the children of disobedience among whom also we had our own conversations in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh of the mind and we're by nature the children of Wrath even as other but God who is rich in mercy whoo hey man he was rich in mercy we found the mighty man of wealth of real well a well that could satisfy our hungry hearts Oh well that could quench our thirst see hearts Amen a wealth that would come and quit you're thirsty beans he's rich and mercy for with his great love wherewith he loved blessed even when we were dead in sins hath quickened anybody quickened us together with Christ by grace are you saved and has raised up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of His grace in his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus blessed beyond measure he has blessed us with all spiritual blessings they said his spiritual blessings not just the Apostles or some to this he said is blessed us with all spiritual blessings he's blessed us at the same Holy Ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost here tonight blessed a man the same Holy Ghost listeners that made merry shouting speaking tongues and have a wonderful time and rejoice and the things that she did is the same Holy Ghost that's here tonight the same Holy Ghost said led Paul on that old ship and the water long looked like it was going down every wave had a devil on it and cleaning his teeth and said I'm going to sink you now and Paul went down and pray and an angel came and said it's going to be all right eat your supper he said what was it Paul was blessed with spiritual blessings and here he comes dragging them changing his little arms dragging him on his feet and said be of good courage man for an angel God has met me this and stood by me and said fear not he said what was it it was the Holy Ghost that same Holy Ghost is here tonight glory to God it's same one that I can look you in the eye and say don't fear don't worry you're not going down I got a predestinated plan for you and it's not for beneath it's for power I'm not make you the tale but I'll make you the head cause you a blast those spiritual blessings he's gonna stop there in heavenly places we'll let's stop there for a moment not just anywhere but in heavenly places we are a simpler than heavily it means that is the position of the believer that if I'm prayed up you're prayed up or the church is prayed up we're ready for the message and we've assembling ourselves together where the called out baptized with the Holy Ghost filled with God's blessings called elected set together in heavenly places we are having the heavenlies in our souls our spirits have brought us into a heavenly atmosphere there your heavenly atmosphere Oh what could happen tonight what can happen tonight if we're sitting in heavenly atmosphere and the Holy Spirit begins to move over every heart that's been regenerated and become a new creature in Christ Jesus our sins from the blood perfect worship and our hands are up to God and our hearts lifted setting together in heavenly places he said what can happen when he's blessed us and he says blessing with what what has he blessed us with divine healing foreknowledge revelations visions is it a direct quote powers tones interpretations wisdom knowledge all the heavenly blessings joy unspeakable and full of glory every heart filled with the spirit of walking together sitting in heavenly places well what a blessed Church we are tonight to realize the Holy Ghost that was on the damned Pentecostals anointing us tonight not just anointing but filling our hearts and supercharged in our lives that we can be blessed with divine healing it's a blessing He bestows on us we can be blessed with foreknowledge well I thought the Prophet did that well that's not what he said he's in the church he says evil no evil thoughts amongest oh I'd be a good one to run out not one cigarette smoke I hope that's taken care of not one short dress hallelujah not one dish without another evil thoughts nobody got anything against another hello somebody do you want to be this you want to receive these kind of blessings you better get rid of what you got against somebody else come on somebody you know I'm a blessed person are you really do you really want to be blessed I'm just reading you a quote speaking of love harmony everybody with one Accord in one place it said everybody how many everybody's we got in here yeah everybody everybody amen a man that we want we want to be blessed he said this is it not one evil thought among us not one cigarette smoke not one short dress or anything others not evil thought not nobody got anything against another no Amen nobody spear buddy speaking in love and harmony everybody one Accord in one place and then suddenly they came a sound from heaven like a rushing mighty wind he went there you are he has blessed us with all spiritual blessings continuation of the quote then the Holy Spirit my fall upon somebody saying thus saith the Lord o go to a certain place do a certain thing watch what happened thus saith the Lord do a certain thing in a certain place watch it happen like that bless us together in all heavenly places a man what is it according as he has chosen us did we choose him or did he choose us he chose you even when you wouldn't choose him when did it uses the night we accepted him no he chose you before the foundation of the world now you would be wholly without playing in love when did God chooses when did God choose you that's got the Holy Ghost when it it's used before the foundation of the world by his foreknowledge II for saw you and knew that you would love him hallelujah he knew I would love him he knew you would love him before the foundation of the world he chose you and then he said Jesus that he might be the perpetuation of your sin and bring him and you together in love bless Psalms 84 and verse 11 said for the lord god is the Sun and shield and the Lord will give Grace and glory and no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly I'm reading our blessings tonight the random said believe it you got to believe it got to be so nice and open that damper open and let it let it come on with you he said what we need today is not pray for more power you got enough power to make a new earth what we need is faith to use that power we need we need us to control that life and live with such a godly life and when you ask God anything you know he's gonna do it and we have confidence in God that we know if we keep his Commandments he'll withhold no good thing from us to walk with him how many's gonna walk with him why God wants to walk with you you know maybe you're in your middle age and you have your last earnings and you want to you know try to invest it I know we got in a guy you can invest with here but Micah hey man but you know you want to make a right decision where to put that investment and if it's your last earnings you don't want to just throw it too you know something that might make you money we won't wanna be wise with it you know where you got these rich quick get-rich-quick things you know invest here and tomorrow you're a millionaire but you wouldn't want to put your money in place like that because it's your life earnings what would you do you with sober and sincerity you'd search for an old reliable firm it's been tested and proved one that's safe and there you divest your money because you you don't want to you don't want it to be some fly-by-night and so if you're you're sincere and concern in your decision about your life earnings how much more sincere should we be about our religion and our salvation our true blessings hey man you know we get all took up about the 401k and stock market this and that that's all fine and dandy but what I'm talking about here be here after all that's gone he said see if you would put that kind of investment in your religion in your salvation you wouldn't go for some of these little fly-by-night ideas or put your name just on a church book or just shake hands with a preacher that won't work he said I would recommend you find an old reliable institution you want to hear about it it was founded on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came down to dwell among men it's the most reliable firm I know of to invest your soul and your future in hello somebody that is an old-fashioned Pentecostal experience [Music] glory God it has been time-tested and has been proven to be the truth hallelujah 2000 years it hasn't changed a bit the same dividends that was paid off at Pentecost it's still being paid off by this firm I don't know you the same gifts of the Holy Ghost the same power of healing to see visions and angels appear to you come on somebody angels to appear to you and the ministry that the Apostles head they carried them safely through it will take your soul to the safe destination just as it took them ha-la-lu we're talking about real blessings we're talking about something that's not just temporary but eternal I wouldn't put myself in some fly-by-night idea how find something that's been time-tested that proved that has the power it proved it on the day of Pentecost it took a man who was a denier and denied Jesus crisis in his

but the blood of the Lamb God does not impute to you anything that's done because you're under the blood and you don't even see it he sees that blood sacrifice and that's the only thing he can see you in is the way he saw you before the foundation of the world when he put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life that's all he can look at because you're redeemed from everything that was ever done and you're washed in the blood of the Lamb we are truly blessed James 1 in verse 12 said blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life which the Lord
