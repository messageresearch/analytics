from Brother Jason Jackson's Church there's a family there some of us know them but they have a two week old little boy they're at the church and the doctor said that they think that he has a disease

people trying to carry it Lord but I think back lord and and I know that over 2000 years ago Lord you carried a cross Lord you carried a burden and you took stripes Lord I think tonight of of sister

enjoying brother Timothy's Ministry the last couple services all right come on now let's do better than that you'll give the man a complex we've enjoyed the word he's done a fantastic job and just yielding himself to the spirit allowing the Lord to use him and you know again I'm just so thankful to be a part of this ministry team to you know we have we have something great here at church just glad to be a part of it put my shoulder to the wheel tonight to be able to minister to you we want to pick back up on where we spoke last time I spoke a couple weeks ago on the word we bring forth I want to speak to you the word will bring forth and we'll do a part two tonight and I have probably several other parts but we're not going to get into all those parts tonight we're going to focus on part two so we look here in John 1 and verse 1. the Bible says that in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth if you turn to Genesis 1 and verse 26 . so we're going to go back to the beginning we're going to see because the Bible says in the beginning was the word in Genesis 1 26 and it said God said let us make man in our image after our likeness then we find in verse 27 so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and notice in verse 28 God blessed them and God said to them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth and invert in Genesis 2 and verse 7 before have you seated Genesis 2 and verse 7 and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and he breathed into his nostrils a breath of life and Man became a living Soul God bless you you can have your seats this evening so from our previous study we realized that man man was made last of all of God's creation God continued advancing his creation until he finally reached the Pinnacle of his creation Now how many have ever been to the mountains and you think wow how beautiful How Majestic how wonderful and you're just in awe of the creation of God and some of you ladies you probably feel that way about the beach but I don't feel that way about the beach but nevertheless you go places and you're in in in wonderment about how beautiful God's creation is and yet you are God's greatest form of creation you're the highest form of creation all the other creatures were created but notice none of the other creatures that were were created were ever created in the likeness of God Man was created in God's likeness in God's image and we find that man is the highest form of God's creation and then in Genesis 2 we find that God took of the Dust of the ground same thing he made all the other creation from and he made you that's here tonight of that creation so notice now that man that creative being he was made on the same day as all animal life but God just kept evolving in his creation because God had a thought in his mind that he wanted to have a family and you are part of that family but in order for God to have that family he had to First create something that was in His image he had to First create something that was in his likeness and the animal like did not match God in that aspect even though they were a creative being they did not have God's image God's formality and God's uh omnipotence everything that God was we're going to find tonight he poured that into his creation So Not only was God's pleased with his creation the Bible says now that he blessed them that word blessed I mean God stepped back and he adored his creation amen it means to adore God stepped back after he made all this that we're seeing tonight and all this the great atmospheres and the great mountains and in wonderful places and all the animal life those are in the sea those in the air those that are on the ground and yet when when God created man and he put man in his own image in his own light as God stepped back and God adored what he'd made and sometimes you wake up and you look in the mirror and you think my look at me I'm just a mess but I'm here to tell you tonight the Bible says you're fearfully and wonderfully made God is adoring his creation again tonight because now that creation that he once created is now just another part of God's continuing of what he did back then but now this creation discretion right here tonight that I'm speaking to tonight is not only Just In His Image but this creation tonight Bears his likeness because now in this hour his spirit is dwelling inside of his creature so we find he says now he stepped back and he blessed him I'll tell you sister Jessica you may have to sing tonight it's the season to be blessed well we're blessed tonight Church you may have a crummy day you may have been hitting everything it seems like the devil's throwing everything you can it's but I'm here to tell you your best because God has stepped back and he stepped and he's looking at you and wondering look at my pride look at my creation there was standing layout us here they're overcoming Satan in his own needing when the world is pushing for for the gay and lesbian agenda they're standing true women are women men are men they're serving me they're not just a denominational creature but they're True born-again Believer and God is adoring you tonight Church notice when he tells them now not only did he bless them but now he tells them be fruitful otherwise bring forth so we're speaking about the word we'll bring forth after his kind so be fruitful bring forth to increase to bear fruit you're not here just to sit on the church pew get out of here just to put money in an offering plea but you're here to be a replica replication of Christ himself of God himself notice he says and multiplying that word multiply there means to become many become numerous to make much to make many now some of us has tried that in our own natural families some of you blinds will get that tomorrow but it's too replenish to make to multiply and the word replenish there means to accomplish what I've set you out to do to replenish to accomplish to fulfill the commission that he's given you it's not to have a house full of kids even though the Bible says that your quiver is full and all that kind of stuff no but it's to bear fruit of his likeness so we call we would call from our last study that we spoke about that life comes from the sea all life no matter where it comes from it comes from the seed and life is in the sea and we find that the spoken word is that Original Seed so when you go to Genesis 1 you find God said God said God said God said and everywhere God said it manifested and manifested and manifested and when he said let us make man in our image I'm going to tell you it's manifesting once again now we find now we we find in Matthew 1 we're going to kind of take our time and look at this tonight brother Timothy looked at my timer I said I'll stop early don't worry Matthew 1 we're going to find that Jesus is the word of God he was the one that was spoken of in the beginning but Eve did not wait to fulfill that portion of the word she jumped the gun or she received another seed instead of waiting to receive from Adam of the spoken word now we found here in Matthew 1 verse 18 says now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with the child notice of the Holy Ghost so here we find let us make man in our image that was that was a decree that was made in Genesis but now we're jumping over into the New Testament the very first chapters of the New Testament and Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example he was minded to put her away probably but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thou wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost so God had already spoke a word and that word was now about to materialize and bring forth what he should have brought forth in Genesis and she shall bring forth the son and thou shall call his name Jesus for he shall save the people from their sins verse 22. now all this was done that it might be fulfilled notice which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet so God already spoke to us and though yet we find that he's representing Isaiah Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth the son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which shall be interpreted God With Us first John 1 and verse 1. that which was from the beginning Genesis 1. which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and we bear witness and we show unto you that that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard and declared we unto you that you also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ so Jesus is the word that was made manifest he is the word he and the word are one they are the same that seed that was spoken in the beginning was now about to be manifested are we fine in Matthew 1 that was manifested in Jesus and brother Brandon would tell us in the message of spoken word is the Original Seed he was that seed that Eve should have produced he was that Offspring now bear in mind c means Offspring descendant it means children so he was at Offspring or that seed that Eve should have produced he was at seed but she hybrid it by disbelieving the word of God see he was that seeding the only way that life could be in the reproduction of life life had to come through the seed and that seed had to die in order to spread out life and that's why the water was given the water to water the seed he said now the holy spirit that was in the Garden of Eden was to water the seed but that seed never came forth in the Garden of Eden in aspect of Jesus Christ now in the message the spoken words original CD said man was not made to die but yet every day you wake up with a new element you wake up with a new sickness a new report from the doctor you wake up with spots on the brain or you wake up with this and that or you have a child and that child has disaffliction and that Affliction and disaffliction but see man in the beginning was not made to die man was made to live but High breeding Eve because she took in another seed she received the LIE of the enemy wanted to do it cost you or it caused you to have all your heartache it's cause you to have all your pain all your aches all your ailments all your the sirens everything that you hear every hospital every doctor everything that was done was done because he did not wait to fulfill the promised word of God which she would had he should have just carried a little longer so brother man will tell us now Jesus is the word may manifest he in the word is one and the same and that's why it was so to be made manifest in him so perfectly that's the reason that God manifested himself so perfectly in Jesus because he was the seed word The Germ word itself The Germ that's inside the seed the life that's inside the seed and that word germ when the prophet of God speaks of that word he's speaking about the life so this is they're they're one of the same germ means life and every seed has a germ in it or it has life in it and whatever you water that seed with whatever's on the inside the light that lays on the inside of that sea will manifest itself so he says now and Jesus had to be broken up there in order for that seed to let forth of its life to order all the other seas that were coming oh man what a beautiful revelation that seed so it necessarily couldn't come in that hour and that moment in Genesis it had to wait for this hour or and when Jesus came and was manifested but that seed couldn't stay alive it had to be broken and so that it could water all the other seas that were coming and the prophet of God will say I'm sending forth the spirit to water it and it will produce just exactly it'll produce Miracles it'll produce the power of God it will produce and it will deny anything or it will not deny anything because it's Kindred with the seed so that's why you can't disbelieve the word because there's a life on the inside of you that will not allow you to disbelieve the word when you hear the word and receive the word you become the word because what the quickening power of the spirit the water it is quickening the seed on the inside and what does it do it it's bringing it forth to life what's already laid inside of you I say Oh Glory to God some of you didn't know that you were C but God came by your way anyway and he broke it open and watered that sea with the one words of life notice now all that God was he pours himself into Christ he emptied himself he kenosed himself into Christ but it didn't stop there because God said I'm going to bring forth replenish multiply replenish the Earth and he said that all that Christ was he emptied himself into his bride I said oh come on little brother what is it it ain't Mama and Daddy's religion you have been quickened for this hour you were seen from the beginning and what you're doing now is only manifesting what you are there [Applause] so though Adam and Eve fell in the beginning and it brought forth death the word had already been spoken let us for they'll make man in our image and God had already blessed it so I don't care what you're going through tonight you're already blessed he's already blessed it well I don't feel like it brother just beside the point the spoken word has already been blessed by almighty God notice now the word that has been spoken it spoke of your coming and you've already been blessed and there's nothing that the devil can do to stop that word from manifesting it may try you with cancer but cancer don't have enough it may try you with Affliction it may try your children it may try your own physical body it may try your finest but I'm here to tell you tonight Satan don't have enough because why the word has already been spoke over your life and what is he doing is quickening to life that's on the inside of the seed and that see God declared will bring forth in his act in its season after his kind God in the beginning blessed his creation and he commissioned his creation to replenish to fulfill my word he's commissioning them to bring forth just like they are because they're in His image in his likeness in his similarity therefore we are to bring forth more Sons and Daughters of God by the spoken word so we find that Jesus was the seed that Eve should have produced but she listened to the LIE and anytime you listen to the LIE complex doubt depression unbelief fear anxiety worry worthlessness anytime you listen to those things you will never produce them for the life that's laying on the inside of you but when you can look away from all those things you can look away and push away Satan's lives and receive what the word says that in there you've been made in my image in my likeness in my similar to you're going to be just like me and when you can receive that word then from your innermost beings whether you know it or not you begin to materialize and you're from your innermost being you begin to become that word come on church amen a little bit louder than that what am I telling you tonight when you respond to the word and I'm not trying to work him get you to respond but I'm telling you when you respond to the word with your amen so be it God that's the word for me they're from the inside it takes through and something begins to break apart all the unbelief breaks the part off your life it breaks apart off that Sea and the life that's laying in the sea but comes to manifest and then you believe the word and then you believe for healing and then you believe the super nice and then you believe the power of God and then you can believe for your lost loved ones I say Oh Glory to God tonight Lord I believe tonight help thou my unbelief [Applause] notice now there was a germ of life that come from the real seed he says but God proved that it was his see because he rose them up again that through that life that's going over the original seat like was given to Eve over his real church is bringing forth life again you're not bringing forth Tim Pruitt's life though we sit under a great ministry he's not wanting a bunch of CopyCat Tim Pruitts or Timothy Pruitts or Aaron oglesby's no he's willing to bring forth of his own self God has a desire to have a family and some of those families are short some of them are tall some are big some of them are skinny we're a bouquet of different types but nevertheless we're of his kind not personality followers but we're the follower of the word of God and I say let that word oh God be it down to me according to your word you want a son in this hour I'll be your son you want a daughter in this out I'll be your daughter I will let the word have its way in my life [Applause] you want to move Lord move through me tonight don't let me hinder the movement of the spirit don't let me push down and stop the flowing of the water coming across the sea it may not be your night but it may be somebody else don't let You Hinder the water flowing up that predestinated seed we have some people they just if it ain't about them they just shut down it may not be about you tonight but don't shut down credit atmosphere so that seeds can be manifested there's times we preach we pour our hearts out we go to the back and we think well that was a flop these brothers will tell you amen they ain't doing it right now but they'll tell you sometimes you just feel like wow that just whoops but what you find somebody come up to you later that's exactly what I needed that helped me so much because it wasn't for everybody it was maybe for one or two or three or four but it was God's word in God's season it fell on good ground and now we finally begins to produce what was already inside of it oh so the germ is the life now notice now I'm gonna get into some stuff tonight and I'm gonna do my best to contain myself to my wife Hi man I've been up shut up you know all but day to day and tell you what it was getting rich up there I had to finally stop say look you can't go no path no further than this stop right here I'd be hey we'll be here three hours a night or more but we ain't gonna do that so let's just move forward let's move forward yeah just let's look in Colossians 1 and verse 12. notice now Jesus is the beginning of the creation of God I'm going to show you something tonight Jesus is the firstborn he's a firstborn and he's also the beginning so we're going to go through some scriptures Colossians 1 and verse 12 we'll start there giving thanks unto the Father which has made us meet to be partakers of his inheritance of the Saints in light who had delivered us from the power of darkness and everybody here tonight should be able to say Amen to that I've been delivered from the power of darkness and he's translated us into the kingdom of his dear son now his son Jesus hold on to that and whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins notice verse 15 who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature you didn't know what God looked like until Jesus walked the shores you didn't know what God was until he came in a Manger you we didn't know what God we didn't we couldn't fathom God all his greatness all his glory and yet he came down and he took on the form of man and many did not believe because why God was so magnificent God was so awe-inspired and yet God created a vessel and he came and dropped down to live in that vessel then when that vessel was here that vessel declared to you the invisible God was now made visible and he was the beginning of the creation of God notice for for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in the earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist everything we do whether it be word or deed we do it in Jesus Christ because that is the name of God so now verse 18. he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead notice he's the firstborn from the dead so let's jump to John 11 verse 25. Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live so he's declared I'm the firstborn from the dead but if you believe in me though you were dead yet you shall live whosoever live with them believeth in me shall never die Acts 26 and verse 23. that Christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead and should show light unto the people and into the Gentiles notice the first to rise from the dead First Corinthians 15 and verse 20. but now is Christ risen from the dead and he has become the first fruits of them that sleep for Since By Man Came Death that's through Adam by a man came also the resurrection of the dead that's through the second Adam for as Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be alive so we finally we go back and we look at this and the Bible tells us that he's the first fruit for all them that slept so all down since Adam's time until Jesus time they all set they all died and they should have all been made in the image of Christ but what happened Eve hybrid and she brought death upon Adam's race or to the human race and now every man that was born he had to go by the way of the great he had to die but when this man came he wasn't born of a man he was born of the Holy Ghost he was birthed by almighty God he was the firstborn of many many brothers he was the first and he is the beginning of the creation of God and I'm here to tell you tonight when he rose again he made a way for you not to die he made a way for you to Break Every curse of sin and he broke it off of you so that the adamic race that would that curse that was on Adam and on his on his kind then was broken off of the second Adam and of his kind and now what he was we are I say Oh Glory to God tonight all that God was I am [Applause] let me slow down a little bit I'm getting excited I apologize so we find here Revelations 1 and verse 18. I am heed that liveth and was dead and behold I Am Alive forevermore amen and I had the keys of hell and of death Revelations 3 and 14 this is to our age and unto the angel of the Church of the laodiceans right these things say at the amen the faithful and the true witness the beginning of the creation of God but bro Brown tells us and wine had to be shepherd He said he started a new creation he Jesus started a new creation what was it a creation of himself God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us was God he said God was created in human form in Jesus Christ his son God dwelt he built his Tabernacle of Flesh and Bones and he lived in that Tabernacle God Emmanuel God With Us he built himself a house to live in so that he can reflect his word to his subjects through that house he said you know what God is when you see Christ so the invisible God was now made visible and the Bible tells in first John 1 and 1 and that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon with our hands and have handled of the word of life now that invisible God is made visible again today not in a one-man Ministry but not in a multi-member body because it's a continuation of the creation of God because he's bringing forth of his kind oh my God oh my notice what he says in laodicean church a how could God be creative if he's a spirit and you're probably wondering that tonight how could God be creative he's the spirit how could that be he's Eternal he never was created excuse me he never will be created because he was God at the beginning but see in the beginning of the creation of God was Jesus Christ when he was made manifest when God lived in him so he became the beginning of the creation of God when he made Jesus and when he came and lived inside of that vessel then he became the beginning of a new creation Church we're not of the old creation we're the new creation so notice see he is God's creation oh my the first and the last the amen the beginning of the creation of God when God created himself a body he come down and lived in it that's the beginning of the creation of God I say God live in this body God live in this body God come and live in me tonight let my life be a continuation of that same life that same spirit that same anointing that same word let it continue to flow forth in this hour though it may be a dark hour dark an hour of apostasy but yet God let that life come and live inside of me and may it manifest not of the old adamic race but of the new creation of that new race of that super church or that super race God let the word be formed in me that I can be a display of your character he says now the Holy Blood that was created by God the blood the life the creation of God Jesus was the beginning of the creation of God you see God made in creation he was the spirit the Bible says he's the beginning of the creation of God how did he begin in the womb of a woman notice Mary's response to the angel be it unto me and when you come to church that should be your response to the angel to the one that's ministering to you to the presence of God it's not a time to block it and shut it back and I don't feel good or preaching me happy no it's be it unto me Lord be it unto me let that word Lord though I may not understand it let it Quicken the sea let it come across my path or don't let me get worried about the music and how loud the speakers are and how bad this one smells or or this one does this God let it be unto me according to Thy word let Thy word be formed to me he said that was the seed The Original Seed when he or when Mary said be it unto me he said that was when the seed came I said Oh Glory to God if the right attitude toward the promise of God will revealed seed then it's going to manifest seed now so you might as well say God be it unto me tonight let the word be formed to me tonight let it come forth from me tonight God that'll be the same see the same Faith a same power a same anointing Lord be it unto me tonight God in his spirit notice he's a spirit so he couldn't be created but he created a body he's got bodies here tonight he created a body that he could live in notice and in that body he ate in that body he slept in that body he talked through that body he walked in that body he healed in that body he preached in that body he performed miracles in that body he cast out devils in that body he walked on water in that body he rose from the grave in that same body he ascended on high in that same body he was the beginning of the creation of God and if that was the beginning what about us now all that he was we are and if he could eat in that body if he could preach in that body if he could walk on water in that body if he could cast out devils in that body what about this body what about the manifesto cheese today we're going to bring forth the same results church I said Oh Glory to God tonight the same word the same anointing the same power a same gospel the same word because the same God oh my notice he was once God above them they didn't know what he looked like and he became god with them through the prophets but now in Christ in that new creation he became God in them that's why he's a new creation at the beginning of the new creation because now God was determined never before had God ever lived in his creation until Jesus and Jesus was the beginning he was the firstborn he was the wave offering that there's more to come there's going to be more seeds coming to life for once God was above him where once he just was with them but now it's the new creation and we're the continuation of that new creation because we're not here because of our own efforts we're here because the holy spirit is now Tabernacle in this hour in this age man again oh come on Church so what he was then he is now he is now he is now you may didn't feel like that this morning or you may have had a rough week but what he was then he is now says Loretta he is now what he was the same power same Authority is what he is now same power same Authority who has more Authority in heaven a sinner saved by grace or an angel he said a sinner that's been saved by grace has more Authority in heaven than the angel who never sinned think about what God has thought of you because not only were you just a sinner God doesn't see that aspect of it he sees the beginning or he sees a continuation of the creation man in my likeness in my image see all that God did in that body as the beginning of the creation of God we are to continue that's why we don't preach another gospel then what Paul preached we preach the same thing Paul priests we preach the same thing all the prophets preach because it's the same word we don't deviate off of it we stay right with it the Bible tells us that Colossians 1 and verse 26 even the mystery which had been hid from the ages and from Generations but now is made manifest in his Saints notice it used to be a mystery where God was who God was but now we find in verse 27 to whom God will make known what is the riches of his glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you come on Christ come on I know you don't feel like it this evening but I'm here to tell you your Christ this evening you're the same creation you're being birthed by almighty God you couldn't stay your sin if you had to because why God had already spoke a word over your life let me just tell some of your moms and dads Satan can't keep your kids but because he's got a word and starting to be spoke over it that they had their offspring they shall be there I say back up devil take your hands off of God's Property tonight we got a word and that word will bring forth hello glory to God tonight the word cannot return void but it will accomplish it will manifest it will produce of its kind I say feel unto me tonight father let me be of that kind that may be of that same spirit [Applause] whoo what was once a mystery is now a manifest what was once a mystery has now been made manifest in the prize Pride notice a little seeing Church age my mama he says to show that he was the first he was the beginning of the creation of God oh do you catch it how could God be creative he's a spirit how could he be he's eternal he never was created he never will be created because he was God at the beginning but he that is the beginning of the creation of God was Jesus Christ when he was made manifest when God lived in him he is God's creation only the beginning oh my only the beginning the first and the last the amen the beginning of the creation of God when God created himself a body he came down and lived in that that's the beginning of the creation of God he says oh isn't that wonderful and now we find he showed his deity right there on the Almighty I am he that was which he is and which shall come be Almighty to the church at Ephesus said it three times is that right comes right on over to the laoda sin and said I am the amen I was the first back there I am the last over here I am the beginning of the creation of God that through the church ages they were to have you'll learn that I am God God created man in form and I am the beginning of the creation of God only the beginning he had Seven Ages to manifest himself he manifested himself down through Seven Ages and now we're here well the Omega God or the alpha God is now the Omega he said one of the same the beginning and the ending he says you see what I mean he said it is the germ that come from the sea he is the word of God made perfectly manifest he is correctly the son from the first Adam was the son that was promised through Adam to continue on the human race and so what you are tonight is the continuation of that Genesis promise knows everything that Adam lost Jesus was oh what did Adam lose Adam lost in Eternal rain Adam could speak and things would move come on are you with me tonight sometimes we wish we could speak things and they move but I'll tell you we're getting back to a place church when we can speak not just of our own willy-nilly self but we can speak under the unction of the Holy Spirit and you can see things move you can speak to that devil and he's got to take his hands off you can speak to that life and that life has to go by because we are back on speaking terms with the father because what it is no longer the Adam race coming down but now hit the beginning has now flowed down through seven churches and we are the culmination of all of it I say Oh Glory to God tonight we are the finality we are the final voice to the final days we are the mouthpiece of almighty God if he is ever going to come he's going to come through you he's got to come through us tonight I say feel I'm coming on according to your word Hallelujah let that word be formed in me he says you can't be seed now can we spin that clock back about 30 minutes Mercy he says he you can't be seized and disagree with the word did you hear that you can't be seized and disagree with the word because the word is the seed and if you are the word how can you disagree with it you'd be disagreeing with yourself and we ain't split personality we ain't uh bipolar people oh God don't create bipolar people we know he don't create split personalities no we believe the word we stay with the word and the nature of our parents how many have ever heard we've talked about it the family strain that follows a family now I got a young son over here and I got a young daughter right here and she goes off to Ohio last year they said we're going to call up Little Joe Adams so why'd they call Little Joe she don't look like me she's beautiful pretty hair talented plays the panel really well but what is it there's something that was deposited in her she didn't question it she had no she couldn't stop it she couldn't hinder it she had nothing to do with it but it manifested itself out but it was the nature of her father and what am I telling you tonight you didn't ask for it but he was there anyway he deposited anyway and in the right time in the right moment it begins to manifest what's manifesting the attributes of the Father the attributes of the word has been taken that's why you say Amen to the work that's why you can dance that's why you can shout that's why you get straight that's why you can Rejoice wow because the attributes of the father is manifesting itself they want to tell you we don't have to get emotional I can't help it I am what I am because the father's nature is manifesting through me and if you had my father you may do the same see we take to Nature nature of our parents the attribute begins to flow out now as we go on a few more services down if I had the opportunity to speak to you I want to speak to your manifested sons that's part five somewhere around there yeah I don't work myself way out there in the future his full time is great study study study but we fine see brother Brown says you can't make yourself anything different than what God intended you to be come on somebody needs to tell their complex I can't make myself nothing but what God intended me to be see anything else is an impersonation therefore if your conversion is only because you're trying to hide behind something or trying to make yourself a better person you're only playing the part of a hypocrite so you can't make yourself bride you're not bribed by your choosing but you're bribed by God's choose of cockle bar can only be a cocoa bar you you can hybrid it you can mix it but in the end it's gonna only be a cocoa butter and as much as I like to be tall dark handsome I'll never be that y'all supposed to laugh right there as much as I would love to be a great singer and the spirit of God just come flooding down and bathe over the people that gift is not in me I'm not going to get up you do huh I'm not gonna get up here and try to manufacture that and impersonate that we'll all be plugging our ears tonight for see I can only be what God's deposited in me seeing if that life is in you you can't manifest nothing but that life he said well brother Joe then why do some people take a long time why is it 40 years 50 years 90 years because of Son of God a seed can lay dormant for a long time but it doesn't mean that the sea will never deposited the sea was always deposited it was put there before the foundation of the world when before God's blew out the planets off of his head God planted that seed inside of you you were a thought of God there and then so he says here now notice we're not bastard-born children I want you to get that tonight you may feel like that sometimes but you're not bastard-born children a meal can never breed itself back to a horse can never breed himself back to a donkey but a meal will always be a mule he's gonna die and he'll never produce Offspring what am I telling you you'll never be a denominational believer because that seed ain't inside of you what's on the inside is the word see and from that word when it comes in contact with that word with the spirit of God and the spirit of God brings you and quickens that see it will manifest of its kind we're genuine wine Sons and daughters of God let me get somewhere where I can bring this start bringing this down all right he said all of God's Sons must be the same to be born of the word and spirit brings us back to the spoken word again like in John 3. to be born of the water and of the spirit what does it do then it brings you right back again unto the place where you should have been at the beginning see that's the reason of Christ's death it brings us right back again to sons of God and he said eve would have brought forth that child she would have finally done it did not God tell her multiply and replenish the Earth now I'm going to go here for a few more minutes all right I'm gonna tap on this I tapped on it last time and I didn't get to get where I wanted to go so just hold on tight will you hold on tight with me tonight we file in Ephesians 1 Paul and the Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us now that word bless their means that means he has prospered us it's a different word blessed than it was in Genesis now he's prospering that sea and he says now with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of his glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved now some of you are looking for acceptance there's your acceptance right there you looking for a click click up with that you look for somebody to fellowship with fellowship with that word right there he have made you accepted in the Beloved so notice we think well I chose God when I did this and it was such a bad thing and you know I chose God I I decided I was going to circle I know you didn't have anything to do with it God chose you he said we were chosen in him and that word chosen that means to pick out God picked you out now I was a fat kid when I grew up I was the last to be picked don't be laughing I was the last one I sit there like this you know how my self-esteem felt but this ain't the case with God God said I was chosen before the foundation of the world where was I chosen not on the volleyball court when I was the last one because I was short because I was stupid couldn't move and unathletic no I was chosen in God's mind but for the foundation of the world God chose me and him I said all glory to God and if God ever chose you tonight he cannot choose you you know sometimes you wish you could unchoose people cause they fall over themselves they stumble they missed the ball there I wish I would have never picked it but it ain't like that with God if God ever chose you he cannot choose you I said Oh Glory to God tonight God told you Church you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world he picked you out there's Millions out there that ain't sitting where you're sitting but God chose you to sit here God chose you to be a part of your family God told you to be a part of this church God chose you tonight hey God will not Choose You what did he choose in himself and what did he do predestinated us unto the adoption of children to bring forth predestination and I'm gonna go in this just for a minute hold on to your seat I may be a little past 8 30. notice now he says Smyrna Church days before there was ever a speck a stardust before God was God God is an object of adoration and no one was there to worship him so he was at that time only potentially God he was known only as the eternal spirit but the bride was already in his mind well I'm having a bad day but you was already in his mind well I don't feel like I'm saved but you was already in his mind well I'm going through a trial but you was already in his mind my finances are bad but you was already in his mind he said yes she was she was existing in his stuff and what about those thoughts of God he says they are Eternal are they not he had chosen Us in him Jesus but for the foundation of the world that means that right there with him in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world that gives an eternal quality to the elect and you can't get away from that now not everyone that is living every human that is living can fit that scripture it's only for the chosen it's only for those that were with Christ that was with the Lamb of for the foundation of her when he was slain it's only for those that was in the mind of God and the thoughts of God and when he was thinking of a family when God desired to have a family God put you there oh my you know when I never thought about having a family I never knew God would give me a beautiful wife and she is beautiful I didn't know he would give me three beautiful daughters and they are beautiful he that he would give me a handsome son I never imagined it but God did and when God needed certain qualities to be a part of that family God thought of you and God thought of you and God thought of you and God placed you there you were chosen in him there because there's something inside of you you may take a little bit different than somebody else but it fits God's family and God was determined that in this hour he's going to manifest the attributes of his family chosen in him predestinated Unto the Sons of God to the children of God that's why you're here tonight what you're doing here tonight you're expressing the quality that was in God's mind the word that was in God's mind you're here tonight expressing manifesting who God is my brother Brandon would go on the spoken word he says now who is it to everybody said no only to the faithful in Jesus Christ now to the faithful in Christ now he's talking to the church now this is not to the outside this is to the church according as he has chosen us did he did you did we choose him he says oh he says no you were according to the word you didn't Jesus said he never or you never chose me I chose you and yea he says when did he choose it when did Jesus say he chose his church before the foundation of the world according as he has chosen Us in him not at the last Revival that Dr so-and-so had no no he says you might read that in the Creed or in a textbook but not in this one according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world when we were chosen at the last Revival tonight we got saved he says he says now listen when there wasn't a world no he said it wasn't a star there was no atoms there was no molecules that's when we were chosen see before the foundation of the world not members we're not members we're born into the family of God God let me tell you church tonight he predestinated you to be there now that word predestination is a strong word and a lot of people push back on it and a lot of people fear it but I'm going to end here tonight with this right here he says notice now it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God it's the word or the seed that comes predestinated eternally from God it's not your physical body but it's the seed that was deposited inside of that body but for the foundation of the world that comes predestinated I said well Joe I got to have some scripture thank you I'll give it to you Romans 8 verse 27. and he that searches the hearts knoweth what is in the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God to them that are called that were called me divinely selected or appointed according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed into the image of his son that word conform there means to be in his similarity in the same form he wants us to be in his likeness notice but he foreknew us so God had foreign that the church should appear before him holy blameless without spot without wrinkle no matter whether you you make it or not God's going to have a church without spot or blemish now he says predestinate it's not a very good word for an evangelist evangelist or a minister to use because it kind of confuses a people when you say predestinate it's kind of like being picked last nobody likes to be picked last well he didn't even pick me God don't operate that way notice God Knows by forek knowledge see there are people that don't believe in predestination even though we find it in the Bible but God being God he's infinite he's all-knowing he knows the end from the beginning therefore God had foreknowledge he knows what will be he knows when it will be how it would be God knows it all he knows the end from the beginning he knows the choices that you will make notice now he knows when you will make those choices good right wrong or indifferent God knows so God says not predetermined evil acts of man nor does God cause those evil acts but rather these acts are permitted Because Why by the foreknowledge of God God knows that man will make the choice that they make and lay him before each and every one of us here tonight is a choice to receive the word or reject the word and I'm here to tell you God already knows the choice that you're going to make and some of you've already made the choice and because of God's foreknowledge and he knows the choice that you would make he predetermines your destiny I say oh glory be to God that's why we're here the foreknowledge of God the predestination under sons of God God knew that you would turn down the world God knew you would quit the drugs God knew you would quit alcohol God knew you would turn things away and receive this word and receive this verse well because of his foreknowledge and because of that he could predetermine your future that's why he could say that I'll give you a new body that's why he can say I got a Rapture prepare for my bride why because the foreknowledge of God has already predetermined that you'll be in a body change you'll be in the Rapture you'll be trashed those streets ago you'll be in a new home it's all based on foreknowledge and if he's God and he is and he's infinite there's nothing that God don't know all right he said that's the reason the entire church every person that will ever be in a Rapture their name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life for the foundation of the world that's right musicians you can make your way back we may have part six now I'm gonna bring this to a close here see God knows he knows your heart the Bible tells us in Romans 8 27 he searches the heart and he knoweth what is the mind of the spirit see God being infinite in the beginning knew the end from the beginning therefore he knew what people would do so he could foretell what would take place he knew what would be therefore before Esau or Jacob was born God could say Esau have I hate it but Jacob have I loved you think man God that's that's wrong you chose one over the other God knew the choice that Esau would make God knew that Esau did not covet the birthright that he saw despised the birthright and when Esau got hungry and when Esau had a need and Esau knew the only way that he would ever get that need met he had to surrender his Birthright and he also knew that in Jacob Jacob wanted the birthright Jacob was willing to do whatever it took to receive that Birthright see he knew the choice and therefore by that choice he can look back and say Esau have I hated he didn't hate Esau the man he hated Esau the choice because he choose to reject the birthright Jacob have I loved he loves this word he loves this message when so many are walking away from it he doesn't hate him well then no man would perish but all will come to everlasting life but he knows the choice he despises the choice he despises a choice but he loves all I'm here to tell you tonight Church the word is bringing forth because there's a people in the land today just play something there's a people that's in the land today like Jacob they want the birthright and because of that choice God's predestination it's not into Hell Fire it's not into the tribulation period he's predestinated you too One Moment In a new body some of us are needing that new body quicker than others but that's our pretty that's what he's determined our destiny to be so tomorrow morning when you wake up and you're feeling all bad sing about a God's predestinated me to me to something greater than this and Satan's doing all that he can to keep that predestinated for ordained seed for manifesting but he don't have enough he's tried alcohol brother Johnny he's tried drugs he's tried homelessness he's tried to spare he tried Suicidal Thoughts he's tried depression he's tried anxiety he's turned your kids against you but he don't have enough [Music] because why are you here tonight because you're manifesting the Eternal thoughts of God we're here and as long as we're here we're going to bring forth and that word is going to water it's going to come down on our services and it's going to water the spirit is going to Quicken the seed he said brother Joe what happens if I go in the grave what happens well you've got a free ticket
