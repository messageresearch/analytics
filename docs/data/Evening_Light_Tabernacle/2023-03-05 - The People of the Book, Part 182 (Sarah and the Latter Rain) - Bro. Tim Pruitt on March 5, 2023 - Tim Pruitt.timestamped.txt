[22:49] him this morning
[22:51] you know you y'all all know we we live
[22:53] right here and I was just thinking about
[22:55] it throughout the weekend is
[22:57] as the storm came over and we you could
[22:59] you could feel the power of it
[23:01] underneath your feet you know because it
[23:02] got underneath the house and you could
[23:05] actually feel the end of the house where
[23:07] you're in trying to lift
[23:10] but when they put those houses in they
[23:12] anchor them in the ground
[23:13] [Music]
[23:14] and no matter how strong the storm was
[23:16] and the things that got tore up those
[23:18] anchors held us
[23:20] and I'm thinking you know we're talking
[23:22] about a trailer house man
[23:26] what about the anchor of Jesus Christ in
[23:28] our life today
[23:29] you know the storms come and then they
[23:31] blow and and sometimes you feel like man
[23:34] we're just fixing to blow away but I
[23:36] promise you The Anchor Holds and if
[23:39] you're not anchored in him this morning
[23:40] find that anchor it'll hold you through
[23:43] every situation in life amen let's go to
[23:46] him this morning

[24:06] morning to lift up your name the name
[24:07] that is above all names Lord and to

[24:14] find the praise and the worship Lord
[24:15] that'll be acceptable in your sight the
[24:18] Lord that you'll just come and fill this

[24:52] receive Lord May there be an anointing
[24:54] that comes and breaks the chains and
[24:56] breaks the Fetters and and bitterness be

[26:04] wind Lord and today we look at the
[26:06] storms of life and we once again declare
[26:09] it's going to take a stronger wind than

[52:34] Lord
[52:36] you are here in this last day to finish
[52:39] the work
[52:40] and we love you and we appreciate you
[52:42] Lord
[52:44] oh God
[52:46] we can never express it enough
[52:49] how great you are
[52:51] what you mean to us
[52:54] you're our bright groom soon coming King
[52:58] you're the Lord of lords and the prince
[53:03] King of Kings
[53:05] you're our King this morning maybe the
[53:08] world don't recognize you yet
[53:11] perhaps before you who recognized as a
[53:14] king of the earth Satan will reign for a
[53:18] little while
[53:19] but Lord You're the coming King and
[53:23] we're preparing our hearts today
[53:26] to receive you
[53:28] your kingdom is already built within our
[53:30] hearts
[53:32] we have received of your spirit Lord
[53:35] and we thank you for your grace Lord
[53:38] thank you for the mighty works that
[53:41] you're doing Among Us
[53:42] but what you promise that you would do
[53:45] Lord oh God as we look toward the end
[53:49] and we know Lord
[53:51] you that have become this race will
[53:53] finish it
[53:54] the battle that you started out the
[53:58] battle that began in the heavens when
[54:00] Lucifer was thrown out
[54:03] Lord it will end
[54:05] it'll end with the casting out of sleep
[54:08] The Binding of him for a thousand years
[54:12] hallucinate
[54:14] loosen and then the final destruction of
[54:18] all of our enemies
[54:20] one day we'll look down into the pit
[54:24] as we see him fall
[54:28] we'll see this one this worm this
[54:32] Destroyer
[54:34] this awful one that has caused so much
[54:36] grief and heartache we see him just
[54:40] forever
[54:42] come to an end
[54:45] Lord for us there's no ending for us
[54:48] there's an eternity ahead
[54:51] Lord we look away from this temporary
[54:54] life with his afflictions with his
[54:56] troubles with his trials
[54:59] with the troubles that are going on in
[55:01] this world
[55:02] we look away from that
[55:04] through the eternities from which we
[55:06] come and we know we're being drawn back
[55:09] to where we come from
[55:12] so Lord let us be like the little dude
[55:14] drop that comes down in the Stillness of
[55:16] the night
[55:17] maybe it don't even know where it came
[55:20] from or how it got there
[55:23] but it's there
[55:25] in the darkness it came
[55:28] but when the sun rose and signed upon it
[55:32] it glistened and shined and shouts
[55:35] because it knows it's being drawn back
[55:38] to where it come from
[55:40] and we know Lord there's a drawing of
[55:42] the holy spirit in our lives today this
[55:45] drawing us back
[55:46] to where we come from and like the
[55:50] psalmist said Lord as the dear that
[55:53] heart patents for the water Brook
[55:56] so thirstus are sold for thee o God
[56:01] oh it's the noise of the water spouts
[56:04] the Deep calling into the deep
[56:07] Lord thank you that there's something in
[56:09] us to respond I pray Lord that every
[56:12] soul today will be touched in your
[56:14] presence and changed let your Holy
[56:18] Spirit just reign in our midst I pray
[56:21] for the anointing of the spirit to
[56:23] strike the word Lord
[56:25] today
[56:27] Lord almost like upon us here scattered
[56:31] thoughts
[56:32] little fragments here and things we
[56:34] picked up there
[56:36] oh God almost like loose ends
[56:41] that will need to be tied into one
[56:43] message and it'll take the Holy Spirit
[56:44] to do it and I just prayed today that
[56:48] you will anoint me by the Holy Ghost
[56:51] to be able to rightly divide the word of
[56:54] Truth to lay it out perfectly where we
[56:57] can see the day in the hour that we're
[56:59] living
[57:00] Lord I pray you'll bless your people
[57:02] those around the world those that are
[57:04] listening in joining us by the way of
[57:07] internet that I hear it even in the week
[57:09] to come for months ahead may you touch
[57:12] their hearts today
[57:14] or you could change them in your
[57:16] presence may you ripen the mostest son
[57:19] would come upon the grain
[57:21] pick all the greenness and maturity out
[57:25] put in there Lord the full matured word
[57:29] of God
[57:31] today
[57:32] we know the plantings
[57:34] almost over
[57:36] we've come to the end of the teaching
[57:39] brain Lord we're here in the Harvest
[57:42] cycle
[57:43] I pray that you'll just move by your
[57:46] spirit now
[57:47] Quicken the words that we speak and may
[57:50] they become spirit in life because that
[57:53] they are Spirit moved
[57:56] and because the Dynamics of the Holy
[57:59] Ghost comes upon the mechanics
[58:02] to make the word live
[58:04] let it live in our hearts we pray in
[58:07] Jesus name
[58:09] amen amen God bless you it's good to be
[58:13] in the house of the Lord today thank you
[58:15] amen we so appreciated the wonderful
[58:18] songs of Zion today and the rejoicing of
[58:22] the Lord and the good things that he has
[58:25] done and and continues to do and our
[58:28] midst and we're looking to him to
[58:30] minister to us today and I want to say
[58:34] as I'm going into
[58:36] the subject that I'm going into today
[58:39] it's um it's it's going to be a little
[58:42] bit
[58:43] um of teaching that we will go into and
[58:46] that um I want to kind of drop back
[58:49] because we've been preaching a little
[58:50] bit evangelistically and Gathering some
[58:53] of these thoughts and now I want to just
[58:54] kind of lay in some things of the word
[58:57] so that we can then build upon them in
[58:59] the weeks to come as God will lead us
[59:03] and
[59:04] um but this is for your edification for
[59:08] your knowledge for your understanding
[59:09] that you can solidly know where we're at
[59:13] in this hour
[59:15] because it's very important to know what
[59:18] God's doing
[59:19] right now
[59:21] you know hindsight as we say is always
[59:23] 20 20 and and yet on the other hand we
[59:26] have a lot of the world today that looks
[59:28] back and they can't see what God has
[59:30] done
[59:31] they cannot see his works and and the
[59:34] manifold Glory of what he's been doing
[59:37] uh and they they don't recognize the
[59:40] spirit of God haven't moved through a
[59:43] message in this last day they have not
[59:46] seen the end time message even though
[59:48] they look back they cannot see it but we
[59:52] can look it back and we can see it
[59:54] but today when we're looking at things
[59:57] we're we're wanting to see clearly now
[59:59] where we're at in this time I think this
[1:00:03] is very important to to understand so
[1:00:07] we're going to be speaking today on
[1:00:08] Sarah and the latter Reigns of our
[1:00:11] scripture we're going to start with
[1:00:13] Genesis chapter 18.
[1:00:15] and we're going to look at verse 10. now
[1:00:19] remember we're using the types in the
[1:00:21] Bible
[1:00:22] to to that are shadows that
[1:00:27] um Can portray what is coming
[1:00:30] so if you'll look at these types A type
[1:00:33] is um a shadow if I could demonstrate a
[1:00:37] shadow which I came properly here right
[1:00:40] now but if you look at a shadow you can
[1:00:43] never see all quite all the details you
[1:00:46] can't see the
[1:00:48] um you cannot see of my the shadow of my
[1:00:50] hand you can't you can see there are
[1:00:52] five fingers you can see one is the
[1:00:55] thumb of those fingers and you can
[1:00:58] identify different parts but you can't
[1:01:00] see the fingerprints you can't see
[1:01:04] um the color you can't there's a lot of
[1:01:07] things there that are in the
[1:01:10] um in the true positive that cannot be
[1:01:13] seen in the negative
[1:01:15] so but however you can get an idea of
[1:01:19] what is approaching by looking back and
[1:01:23] seeing the shadow
[1:01:24] so we're going to be looking here again
[1:01:26] at Genesis I'm just reading one verse
[1:01:28] verse 10 and he said I will certainly
[1:01:31] return unto thee according to the time
[1:01:33] of life
[1:01:34] and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son
[1:01:37] and Sarah heard it in the tent door
[1:01:39] which was behind him something very
[1:01:41] important I want you to understand
[1:01:43] here is the son of man Christ
[1:01:46] in Angelic form standing there
[1:01:49] Discerning the hearts of Sarah in the
[1:01:52] tent behind him this is the last sign
[1:01:56] that will be shown but it's not the last
[1:01:59] appearing
[1:02:01] because he said I will certainly return
[1:02:05] unto thee according to the time of life
[1:02:09] so here he was there manifesting to sign
[1:02:12] the son of man he would be bringing a
[1:02:15] message and we'll go into that in a
[1:02:17] little bit about that and and but then
[1:02:20] he says but I'm going to return
[1:02:22] according to time of life
[1:02:24] so there is every even though that this
[1:02:27] is a manifestation of God that there is
[1:02:30] a return promise turn with me to Joel
[1:02:32] chapter 2 verse 23 these are what Peter
[1:02:37] will refer to on the day of Pentecost
[1:02:39] which actually will cover the last two
[1:02:42] thousand years and again be very
[1:02:44] important for our day so again this is a
[1:02:48] prophecy of our day and and it speaks
[1:02:51] naturally of Israel being restored and
[1:02:55] it speaks spiritually of the Bride which
[1:02:59] is the Royal seat of Abraham who will be
[1:03:02] restored so be glad then you children of
[1:03:04] Zion rejoice in the Lord your God for
[1:03:08] you have given you the former Reign
[1:03:10] moderately and he shall cause to come
[1:03:13] down for you the rain the former rain
[1:03:16] and the latter rain in the first month
[1:03:18] and the floors shall be full of Wheat
[1:03:20] and the fat shall overflow with wine and
[1:03:22] oil so now let's look at that verse 23
[1:03:25] one more time before uh while I want to
[1:03:28] get some thoughts to you right here to
[1:03:30] point out in this scripture that he
[1:03:33] gives you the former Reign and the a lot
[1:03:37] of rain in the first month so here will
[1:03:41] be an unusual time
[1:03:43] because normally the former and latter
[1:03:46] rain don't come in the first month or
[1:03:48] the same month
[1:03:49] but here he said in this outpouring I'm
[1:03:53] going to give you the former and the
[1:03:55] latter rain together
[1:03:57] in the first month now then will you
[1:04:01] turn with me to Luke chapter 21 verse 29
[1:04:04] and I want to point out some things here
[1:04:07] and this also and he spoke to them a
[1:04:10] parable a parable again is a type
[1:04:13] it is a shadow it is a something that
[1:04:18] he's telling to represent something that
[1:04:21] is going to happen so he uses
[1:04:23] figuratively and he says look or behold
[1:04:26] the victory but he don't stop there and
[1:04:30] all the trees somebody say that with me
[1:04:32] all the trees so now we're not just
[1:04:36] going to have the victory restored but
[1:04:39] we're going to have all the trees now
[1:04:42] watch when they now shoot forth you see
[1:04:45] and know of your own selves that summer
[1:04:48] is nigh at hand Harvest time is coming
[1:04:52] and so likewise when you see these
[1:04:54] things come to pass know you that the
[1:04:56] kingdom of God is not hand verily I say
[1:04:59] unto you this generation shall not pass
[1:05:01] away till all be fulfilled God bless you
[1:05:05] you can have your seats we're going to
[1:05:08] now
[1:05:09] um just as I as a set I'm going to lay
[1:05:11] some things out in a very
[1:05:14] um you know trying to uh slowly and
[1:05:17] methodically teach some of this we
[1:05:20] probably will not stick with teaching as
[1:05:22] we go along but and and maybe some of
[1:05:25] this will be somewhat more Evangelistic
[1:05:27] but
[1:05:28] um it'll be toward the end as I try to
[1:05:31] establish some things today that is that
[1:05:34] I have been studying and it's been on my
[1:05:36] heart but it's something that I feel
[1:05:38] like the church should know as to where
[1:05:41] we are in time and what to expect where
[1:05:45] we are now now we know that as the
[1:05:48] victory Israel is firmly planted in her
[1:05:51] promise slam and she's blossoming
[1:05:54] and what is interesting though that in
[1:05:57] this same time frame of Israel's
[1:06:01] founding as a nation the angel of God is
[1:06:06] appearing to brother Branham the prophet
[1:06:07] of God and promising the rest the soon
[1:06:12] return of Jesus Christ and the and that
[1:06:15] starting with the gifts of Divine
[1:06:17] Healing that he was now pouring out his
[1:06:21] Spirit making things ready for his
[1:06:23] coming so what's now things are
[1:06:25] happening simultaneously as Israel
[1:06:28] becomes a nation the angel of God is
[1:06:30] appearing to a prophet and then notice
[1:06:33] then as he as we say in the same time
[1:06:36] frame in 1940 in the 1940s the World
[1:06:40] Council of churches is formed as it does
[1:06:44] the United Nations
[1:06:46] so now you have things that are going on
[1:06:49] Israel becoming United becoming in their
[1:06:51] Homeland a move that starts to to gather
[1:06:55] the bride the elect for the last day it
[1:06:59] also begins with an angel coming
[1:07:01] to uh to a prophet and then we have the
[1:07:05] Nations unit 19 forming in politics a
[1:07:09] United Nation moving toward a One World
[1:07:12] Government
[1:07:14] and then we have the churches you're 19
[1:07:17] coming together in EC communism
[1:07:20] now
[1:07:22] um even and I I want to just say
[1:07:23] something about that just for a moment
[1:07:25] because just because you do not yet see
[1:07:29] maybe a big move in the world Council of
[1:07:32] churches or National Council or that The
[1:07:35] ecumenical spirit is already went
[1:07:37] through the land Gathering many of these
[1:07:41] and brother Brandon would tell us that
[1:07:43] you know that Satan has the mechanics
[1:07:47] together
[1:07:48] and it's only waiting for the Dynamics
[1:07:52] to come upon the mechanics Satan's
[1:07:54] mechanics so he's already got things in
[1:07:57] place to bring about the the persecution
[1:08:01] which the bride will not be a part of
[1:08:03] because there's a Rapture before the
[1:08:05] tribulation but will come upon the world
[1:08:08] and so they're just waiting for Satan
[1:08:11] with the Dynamics now let me just
[1:08:14] explain that for a moment when when the
[1:08:17] bride goes up Satan is cast down
[1:08:21] so you know simultaneously the casting
[1:08:24] out of Satan is the going up of the
[1:08:26] Bride so you are a part of the Ascension
[1:08:30] and Satan of course will fall it'll be
[1:08:33] like the Bible said I saw a star fall
[1:08:36] from Heaven so again we're living in a
[1:08:39] time where it's just about over the last
[1:08:44] member of the Bride is being called I
[1:08:47] believe that as the message goes out
[1:08:50] into the world and when the last member
[1:08:54] of the Bride that comes in the Rapture
[1:08:56] takes place and as she goes up Satan is
[1:09:00] cast down you find out in Revelation
[1:09:02] chapter 12 which we won't look at it but
[1:09:05] anyway we we can see that um there has
[1:09:09] been some things put in place the
[1:09:12] mechanics put in place for the Dynamics
[1:09:15] to come
[1:09:16] now you see as we we are saying here
[1:09:20] that um the the fig tree has made its
[1:09:24] has made its um uh put out its leaves
[1:09:28] and all the other trees are doing it at
[1:09:30] the same time
[1:09:31] and this was this has been the planting
[1:09:35] rain or the former rain where seeds were
[1:09:39] planted for Unity a United Israel United
[1:09:42] Churches United Nations and a bride
[1:09:46] United with the word and ultimately with
[1:09:49] Christ with the median in the air now
[1:09:52] brother Branham tells us in the message
[1:09:54] look he said when you see the Fig Tree
[1:09:57] and all the other trees putting forth
[1:09:59] her buds Israel returning as a nation
[1:10:02] they are a nation we see other trees the
[1:10:04] methodists have put forth put there's
[1:10:07] forth the Baptists having theirs the
[1:10:09] Catholics having theirs all the rest of
[1:10:12] them having theirs the Pentecostals to
[1:10:14] Oral Roberts having theirs and all the
[1:10:17] rest of them having their revivals
[1:10:19] putting forth this Branch then know that
[1:10:22] the time is at hand this generation
[1:10:26] shall not pass until all these things be
[1:10:29] fulfilled now I I will admit you know
[1:10:33] down through time we have been in a
[1:10:35] hurry to see things finished
[1:10:37] and we you know there's been many have
[1:10:40] that have declared well you know Israel
[1:10:43] his inner Homeland so Generations about
[1:10:46] 40 years and and so is surely 40 years
[1:10:50] into 48 and will make 88 and by that
[1:10:54] time by you know that that this
[1:10:56] generation be passed away and and I want
[1:10:59] to just make it clear to you that people
[1:11:02] have thought that because that the
[1:11:05] United Nations recognized Israel being
[1:11:09] in her place and and what that this that
[1:11:12] this generation will not pass away but I
[1:11:16] want you to understand it is not when
[1:11:19] Israel is recognized by the world as a
[1:11:22] nation
[1:11:23] you see as I said United Nations
[1:11:26] recognized her in 1948 but when it but
[1:11:28] it's when God recognizes Israel as a
[1:11:32] nation
[1:11:33] and that's when the gospel returned to
[1:11:36] the Jews when they received their two
[1:11:38] prophets who brings them back to the
[1:11:41] original atonement
[1:11:43] now I know they're making plans of
[1:11:45] another Temple and they're going to have
[1:11:48] the articles of sacrifice and breeding
[1:11:50] over a red heifer area all of this hype
[1:11:53] and hysteria over that you know I I just
[1:11:56] say this the blood of bulls and goats
[1:11:59] will never take away sin
[1:12:02] so you see what will happen is is the
[1:12:06] two witnesses will not return them to
[1:12:09] the Mosaic or Arabic priesthood but they
[1:12:13] will return them back to the Messiah
[1:12:16] that they crucified 2 000 years ago
[1:12:20] because he is the original atonement and
[1:12:24] they will receive of his blood his
[1:12:27] spirit and when they do they are sealed
[1:12:29] in 144
[1:12:31] 000 of them under their two prophets now
[1:12:34] that's when God recognizes Israel
[1:12:38] and that generation will not pass away
[1:12:40] until all be fulfilled
[1:12:43] but first we we got to understand types
[1:12:46] when we are going into this I want to
[1:12:48] talk about types just for a moment we
[1:12:51] have been preaching on Sarah and Abraham
[1:12:53] and we've been typing and foreshadowing
[1:12:55] the end time but the type can be used in
[1:12:59] more than one way and and still be a
[1:13:01] true type understand that it can be
[1:13:05] typed in a in several different ways for
[1:13:07] example you know their brother Bradham
[1:13:10] types the bride as an espouse virgin
[1:13:13] she's engaged and she's going to a
[1:13:16] wedding in the sky
[1:13:18] and uh then there's other times he
[1:13:20] speaks of her is already married uh the
[1:13:24] wife and already married to Christ so
[1:13:28] you say well which one of these are
[1:13:30] right well they're both right it depends
[1:13:31] on how you're typing it in in that
[1:13:34] instance but what you don't want to do
[1:13:36] is mix the types because if you mix the
[1:13:39] types you'll have the bride as an
[1:13:41] espoused woman already pregnant going to
[1:13:43] the wedding so you got all the picture
[1:13:46] confused and clouded so you keep your
[1:13:49] types running in a straight line
[1:13:52] otherwise you get the whole picture
[1:13:54] distorted
[1:13:56] so that's what we want to try to do
[1:13:58] today as we look at this because brother
[1:14:01] Branham would actually use the former
[1:14:04] and latter rain as to type different
[1:14:07] things and if you're a student of the
[1:14:08] message and I'm going to just give you a
[1:14:10] a couple of sermons that you can go back
[1:14:13] and listen to one is uh of course the
[1:14:16] spoken words Original Seed it's together
[1:14:18] it's about a six six and a half hour
[1:14:20] sermon to go through where brother
[1:14:22] Branham is trying to tell us why he has
[1:14:24] done what he's done and why that where
[1:14:27] things are at that moment in time and
[1:14:29] and that he explains his ministry and
[1:14:32] what it has been for and then then
[1:14:36] there's others that he spoke on like in
[1:14:38] the Holy Ghost series that he mentions
[1:14:41] things and also in the in the sermon who
[1:14:45] is this in 1959
[1:14:48] and and so if you want to listen to some
[1:14:51] of this also following that is another
[1:14:54] sermon former and latter rain where
[1:14:56] brother Madam is speaking about the
[1:14:59] former and the latter rain now he is he
[1:15:02] is looking at this
[1:15:04] as um the Reigns let's talk about them
[1:15:07] for a moment the Reigns prophesied of in
[1:15:11] Joel 2 and a Peter on the day of
[1:15:14] Pentecost it identifies the spirit
[1:15:18] falling as the promised rain so when we
[1:15:22] look at foreign latter rain we know it's
[1:15:24] the spirit moving it's the spirit
[1:15:27] watering something is the spirit doing
[1:15:30] something to accomplish a certain goal
[1:15:33] to bring a certain the church to a
[1:15:35] certain growth or to bring it to harvest
[1:15:37] as in the latter rain so now in the
[1:15:40] anointing what's it in time he said that
[1:15:42] rain dropping down from the natural upon
[1:15:46] the natural vegetation of the earth is a
[1:15:48] type of the spiritual Reign which gives
[1:15:51] eternal life dropping down upon the
[1:15:54] church for we call it we call it the
[1:15:57] former rain and the latter rain and it's
[1:16:00] a rain the pouring of God's spirit upon
[1:16:03] his church church so now we know then
[1:16:07] what rain is it's the pouring out of
[1:16:09] God's spirit
[1:16:10] but it's to produce a certain thing
[1:16:13] former rain is for purpose latter rain
[1:16:16] is for another purpose now of course God
[1:16:19] promised in his word a time of
[1:16:22] restoration
[1:16:24] and in one sense or application of the
[1:16:26] type the farmer Reign that fell on the
[1:16:29] day of Pentecost would come again as a
[1:16:32] laddering upon the end time people thus
[1:16:35] the book of Acts was the former reign of
[1:16:39] 2000 years ago and the continuation of
[1:16:42] the book of Acts in our day is the
[1:16:44] lattering that's one use of the type now
[1:16:46] remember we're talking about different
[1:16:48] uses of the same type the latter range
[1:16:51] so we can look at it like that now so
[1:16:54] the latter rain of course would be a
[1:16:56] double portion as it would be the same
[1:16:59] Reign or portion of the spirit that fell
[1:17:02] on the day of Pentecost so we know that
[1:17:05] the end time age is promised to be a
[1:17:08] latter rain for she is a continuation of
[1:17:12] the former Reign that happens in the
[1:17:15] same season or the same 2000 years of
[1:17:18] God dealing with the Gentiles so now but
[1:17:22] let's type it another way call Jose and
[1:17:25] I don't want to confuse you with these
[1:17:26] types but I I want you to get because
[1:17:29] when brother Madam uses them he'll use
[1:17:31] them in different manners depending on
[1:17:33] how he's bringing his sermons or the
[1:17:36] points he's trying to make
[1:17:38] and so brother random looks back to the
[1:17:40] 2000 years ago and he sees the ministry
[1:17:45] of Jesus
[1:17:46] now he sees the ministry of Jesus like
[1:17:50] the farmer ring
[1:17:52] and then the ministry of the Apostles at
[1:17:55] Pentecost was the latter rain
[1:17:59] so that once again in the same month or
[1:18:02] season both Reigns would fall but I want
[1:18:06] to remind you that that first age is the
[1:18:09] alpha age and we are the Omega age and
[1:18:13] they are the same what was in the alphas
[1:18:15] and in the omegas so we would know them
[1:18:18] that the last age mirrors the first age
[1:18:21] as the alpha is the Omega so we are to
[1:18:25] have the former Reign or the ministry of
[1:18:27] Christ and the latter rain the ministry
[1:18:30] of the Apostles in the last age
[1:18:35] so notice this both the minister of
[1:18:38] Christ and the ministry of the Apostles
[1:18:42] in the same age
[1:18:44] this is the age we're living in
[1:18:47] now what happened there two thousand
[1:18:50] years ago of the ministry of Jesus it
[1:18:54] was followed by the ministry of Jesus in
[1:18:57] the form of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:18:59] apostles
[1:19:00] and in a sense again as we look at the
[1:19:02] type that both are the former and latter
[1:19:05] rains if you look back 2 000 years ago
[1:19:08] they had two Reigns Peter on the day of
[1:19:11] Pentecost said that you know this is the
[1:19:13] pouring out of God's spirit this is that
[1:19:16] it was the latter ring coming after the
[1:19:19] former rain had come Jesus had come with
[1:19:22] the teaching Reign and and we're in the
[1:19:26] former Reign and showed the great signs
[1:19:28] and wonders and then he continues on and
[1:19:32] they have a lot of rain on the day of
[1:19:34] Pentecost so two thousand years ago they
[1:19:37] had former latter rain
[1:19:40] and again I want to get back to your
[1:19:42] memory here remember it's the alpha is
[1:19:45] the Omega so what they had back there we
[1:19:49] have again in this last days the
[1:19:51] minister of Christ and the ministry
[1:19:53] Apostle in the same age
[1:19:56] in the same time in the same season or
[1:20:00] as the Bible said in the first month
[1:20:03] now so in this last day the former and
[1:20:07] latter rain fall together
[1:20:09] and the ministry of Christ the the son
[1:20:13] of man and a prophet performing the sign
[1:20:16] of Messiah Discerning the thoughts and
[1:20:19] intents of the heart it showed that the
[1:20:22] full word was coming into manifestation
[1:20:25] and this would be on the former Reign
[1:20:29] followed by the same son of man the same
[1:20:33] Christ but now in Bride form like the
[1:20:37] apostles had in their latter Rain Jesus
[1:20:40] was a former ain't the apostles was the
[1:20:42] latter ring now we looked and we can see
[1:20:44] brother Branham was the repeat of the
[1:20:47] ministry of Christ
[1:20:49] the former Reign and I want to show you
[1:20:51] this morning that he places himself as
[1:20:54] the farmer Reign but there is a bride
[1:20:56] that he introduces who are the people of
[1:21:01] the latter ring
[1:21:04] now at first
[1:21:07] when we in 1959
[1:21:10] brother Branham is still believing at
[1:21:12] this point
[1:21:13] he believes that the Azusa movement is
[1:21:16] the grain he believes they were the seed
[1:21:18] he believes that they were what had fell
[1:21:21] at the day of Pentecost
[1:21:24] um and and even though it was imperfect
[1:21:26] and he said had a lot of fungus on the
[1:21:29] grain that he believed that day indeed
[1:21:31] was the grain but later he would say but
[1:21:34] you know it's like Matthew 24 24 so
[1:21:38] close
[1:21:39] it wanted to see the very left if it
[1:21:43] were possible and he realizes that he
[1:21:46] has misunderstood he has seen a shock
[1:21:50] that is look like the grain but it is
[1:21:54] not the grain but indeed it's just
[1:21:57] another stage of the wheat plant it's a
[1:22:01] move of God it's a work of the Holy
[1:22:03] Spirit but it's not what happened at
[1:22:05] Pentecost 2000 years ago it indeed is a
[1:22:10] shock not the seed
[1:22:13] now of course he realizes this because
[1:22:17] he looks at and says well look what
[1:22:18] they've done they organize what they
[1:22:20] have and when it organizes the life
[1:22:22] leaves just like other movements have
[1:22:24] done since the Catholic church so it's
[1:22:26] been a cycle of Revival and deaths it
[1:22:28] could not be the Original Seed
[1:22:31] hey because it organized
[1:22:36] did Susan Movement we want to get this
[1:22:39] did Susan movement was not the grain
[1:22:43] it was the shock or the husk that the
[1:22:46] grain will come out of
[1:22:48] but the Zeus of Pentecost so resembles
[1:22:52] the grain what the true church is
[1:22:56] supposed to be with signs and wonders
[1:22:58] and genuine tongues and gifts of the
[1:23:00] Spirit and the acts of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:02] that that brother Branham thinks at this
[1:23:05] time that they are the original grain
[1:23:11] now
[1:23:12] if you haven't got it figured out yet
[1:23:15] the message came to brother Branham in a
[1:23:18] progressive manner
[1:23:20] he was not God
[1:23:22] he was not infinite knowing all things
[1:23:25] and upon up to the opening of The Seven
[1:23:27] Seals he views the azusa's Pentecostal
[1:23:31] movement as the Grain and the spirit
[1:23:34] fallen on it as a promised ladder range
[1:23:36] so he even calls that which happened in
[1:23:39] 1906 the latter rains
[1:23:41] and it was commonly thought of all of
[1:23:44] them at that time this is the lottery
[1:23:47] and in one sense it was a lot of rain
[1:23:49] because you know it was the move of the
[1:23:52] spirit for the last day the farmer ain't
[1:23:54] being in the book of Acts and the latter
[1:23:55] ring coming in the last of laodicea and
[1:23:58] age
[1:23:59] but notice it will not be till after the
[1:24:02] seals that he realizes that although the
[1:24:06] Azusa Pentecost are part of the wheat
[1:24:09] plant they are not the grain but the
[1:24:11] shocking and they are the last stage
[1:24:15] of the wheat plant
[1:24:17] before the grain comes
[1:24:22] now if we don't understand that we
[1:24:25] better go try and be Pentecostals
[1:24:28] because
[1:24:29] then we think they're the seed
[1:24:32] but when you realize they're not the
[1:24:34] seed but the shock
[1:24:37] but they look so close to being like the
[1:24:40] seed
[1:24:42] that's what that's what I say a lot to a
[1:24:45] lot of these message churches today
[1:24:46] when's the last time you look like Azusa
[1:24:49] Street
[1:24:52] think about
[1:24:54] when is the last time that you had the
[1:24:56] movement of the spirit and genuine
[1:24:59] tongues and genuine gifts of the Spirit
[1:25:01] of genuine healings and genuine miracles
[1:25:05] it's so much that you look so much like
[1:25:07] the book of Acts the prophet thought she
[1:25:09] was
[1:25:13] right now you know again again in most
[1:25:17] in most cases as we bring it right down
[1:25:19] I I want you to understand the Church of
[1:25:23] this last day will be a book of Acts
[1:25:26] church that's what she is
[1:25:29] now
[1:25:31] the spirit
[1:25:33] moves on them
[1:25:35] and set a real way
[1:25:38] upon the 1906 movement it was a real
[1:25:41] move of the spirit
[1:25:43] but it was moved in such a real way it
[1:25:45] would deceive the elect if it was
[1:25:47] possible
[1:25:48] and and
[1:25:50] um you know
[1:25:52] so they are thought to be the grain
[1:25:55] and the spirit that was fallen on them
[1:25:57] was thought to be the latter rain
[1:26:01] now as we look at this then we want to
[1:26:04] understand if they were not the latter
[1:26:06] rain
[1:26:08] then when is the latter ain't coming
[1:26:17] random tells us what it was given for he
[1:26:19] said the same life was in the tassel
[1:26:22] made the ear it was a Lutheran Church
[1:26:24] that made the Wesley church it was a
[1:26:25] Wesley church that made Pentecost but
[1:26:27] Pentecost what is it it is a restoration
[1:26:30] of the same kind of grain that went in
[1:26:32] the ground at the beginning bringing
[1:26:33] back all the fullness of the power of
[1:26:35] Pentecost by the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:38] Ghost in the last days
[1:26:40] so he looked there at Azusa Street and
[1:26:43] said this Instagram
[1:26:45] I see here the signs of it I see a
[1:26:48] baptism of the spirit I see the fullness
[1:26:51] of power I see the holy ghost moving
[1:26:54] upon them this has got to be the grave
[1:26:57] but I see there's a lot of fungus on it
[1:27:01] there's something ain't quite right
[1:27:02] about it but it's still the grain
[1:27:05] and in the message who is this
[1:27:08] brother Branham again is he is declaring
[1:27:12] what is happening and I want you to
[1:27:14] watch as he ties the latter rain and the
[1:27:17] former Reign together the ministry of
[1:27:19] Christ and the ministry the apostles
[1:27:21] together because it's just beautiful how
[1:27:24] he brings it together and uh in this
[1:27:27] message who is this of he says a few
[1:27:29] years ago the Holy Ghost went forth upon
[1:27:32] the people Believers and it caused him
[1:27:35] to shout and to praise God and separate
[1:27:38] themselves from the things of the world
[1:27:40] and and come out and be a separated
[1:27:42] people now all of that is what the grain
[1:27:45] will be
[1:27:46] a people that are separated people
[1:27:49] a people who shout who believe God the
[1:27:53] Holy Ghost was poured out upon them and
[1:27:55] they spoke with tongues and prophesied
[1:27:57] and did Miracles and signs and he says
[1:28:00] it was a latter rain falling now notice
[1:28:02] he is still thinking this is a latter
[1:28:05] rain
[1:28:06] he's still looking this is the Grain and
[1:28:09] this is a lot of rain and he says now
[1:28:11] but you notice he didn't just leave it
[1:28:14] like that but he said the former rain
[1:28:16] will come with the latter rain and did
[1:28:18] you notice what the first rain was was
[1:28:21] his own rain the reign of Jesus after
[1:28:24] that come the reign of the Apostles and
[1:28:26] in this last days both the reign of the
[1:28:28] Apostles and the reign of the Lord Jesus
[1:28:30] and he said that's what makes
[1:28:35] limits in the name of the Lord and the
[1:28:37] world asks who is it but the Saints cry
[1:28:40] Hosanna to him that cometh in the name
[1:28:42] of the Lord It's the Holy Ghost the
[1:28:45] spirit of God poured out upon the church
[1:28:47] in the last day to show signs and
[1:28:49] wonders the church knows it that born of
[1:28:52] the spirit watch how he did it the
[1:28:54] latter ain't come and then the former
[1:28:56] rain will come with the latter rain to
[1:28:58] confirm the latter ring was true and the
[1:29:00] people said to Peter them people are
[1:29:02] crazy and they went out they're out of
[1:29:04] their mind well they're a bunch of
[1:29:05] Fanatics and that's the same thing they
[1:29:07] said about him that were mixed in their
[1:29:09] opinion they didn't know what to do but
[1:29:11] they knew something was happening but
[1:29:13] watch they called him when he came in
[1:29:16] the form of rain they said he was behold
[1:29:18] of a devil how many times have you heard
[1:29:21] the people say that you that they speak
[1:29:24] in tongues is of the devil haven't you
[1:29:26] heard it them peoples crazy it is up
[1:29:28] their hands shake and speak in tongues
[1:29:30] and Shout they just don't understand it
[1:29:32] that's all scriptures are fulfilled this
[1:29:35] great Gus that is coming now is only
[1:29:38] getting ready for the church ready for
[1:29:41] him when he'll come riding on a white
[1:29:43] horse they'll be assembled together in
[1:29:45] one Accord in one place and then will
[1:29:48] come the Lord Jesus
[1:29:50] so I want you to see the prophet's
[1:29:52] expectation
[1:29:53] of what the latter rain produces
[1:29:57] and even though that he's using the type
[1:30:00] of the latter rain here
[1:30:02] and he's applying it to the Azusa
[1:30:04] Revival and later he'll recognize oh
[1:30:07] that was only the shock and that was not
[1:30:10] the latter rain what is important to
[1:30:13] note is that he is saying that both the
[1:30:16] ministry of Christ and the ministry of
[1:30:19] the Apostles will repeat with both the
[1:30:23] former and latter rain falling together
[1:30:26] in the last age the last age will have
[1:30:30] the ministry of Christ and the ministry
[1:30:33] of Christ in the people in a bride
[1:30:38] are you with me the apostles all in the
[1:30:41] same last age
[1:30:43] now we know already that that brother
[1:30:47] Branham was that Forerunner we already
[1:30:50] know he introduced that Christ we
[1:30:53] already know he had the ministry of
[1:30:56] Jesus Christ and he brought the word
[1:30:59] amen but we know also then if he again
[1:31:05] brought the ministry of Christ then
[1:31:08] there also has to be a display of the
[1:31:11] ministry of Christ in bride's form in
[1:31:14] the last age
[1:31:19] now
[1:31:21] Joel 2 23
[1:31:23] remember they're falling together he'll
[1:31:26] cause he was given you the former aim
[1:31:28] moderately he'll cause to come down for
[1:31:30] you the rain the former rain and the
[1:31:33] latter rain in the first month
[1:31:35] so it's important to note
[1:31:37] that the effects of the spirit
[1:31:40] which makes brother Branham think this
[1:31:43] is a lot of rain
[1:31:45] they are described as this he calls them
[1:31:47] to shout
[1:31:48] praise God separate themselves from sin
[1:31:52] be a separated people come out of the
[1:31:55] world
[1:31:56] and the Holy Ghost poured out upon them
[1:31:58] they spoke with tongues they prophesied
[1:32:00] and done Miracles and signs it was the
[1:32:03] lettering this is what he expected the
[1:32:06] lettering to be
[1:32:10] now notice the farmer Reign the ministry
[1:32:14] of Christ
[1:32:15] which is the ministry of the son of man
[1:32:17] the word comes back with the latter rain
[1:32:20] in the same age to unite with it to
[1:32:22] prove that the latter rain is true
[1:32:25] now any ads that'll take a born-again
[1:32:28] church
[1:32:29] to believe that
[1:32:31] so again he said the holy spirit is
[1:32:34] coming to the church to give signs and
[1:32:37] discernment I want you I want you to
[1:32:39] stop
[1:32:40] for a moment you know things get real
[1:32:42] common to us
[1:32:44] we we look and we we hear Brother
[1:32:46] Branham as brother Timothy Soul
[1:32:49] wonderfully brought out a lot of the
[1:32:51] discernment and things like that and we
[1:32:53] hear Brother Branham you know and God is
[1:32:56] using him in a very specific way
[1:32:59] to discern the thoughts and the intents
[1:33:02] of the hearts
[1:33:03] to call out people's names and tell
[1:33:06] their address and where they come from
[1:33:08] and whatever do you know this was a
[1:33:11] repeat
[1:33:13] of the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:33:17] I want you to understand it's Unique to
[1:33:20] your day
[1:33:23] as it was unique to Christ's day look
[1:33:26] There Was Elijah there was Moses there
[1:33:29] was Jeremiah there was Daniel none of
[1:33:31] them had that Ministry
[1:33:35] they were not listened they were not the
[1:33:38] word they didn't know all things
[1:33:40] but Jesus wants the word and he knew all
[1:33:43] things
[1:33:44] so it goes to show you when the word
[1:33:46] comes again in this day to show you the
[1:33:49] presence of the word
[1:33:52] amen it'll discern the thoughts and
[1:33:54] intents of Hearts like it did Sarah in
[1:33:56] the tent behind him don't let this
[1:33:59] become common to you I mean we get used
[1:34:01] to it
[1:34:03] and we think that that's just the way
[1:34:05] things are no we were seeing the
[1:34:09] ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:34:11] we were seeing the word identified by
[1:34:16] the sign
[1:34:20] that this is a message
[1:34:23] Hallelujah that this is the message
[1:34:26] do you realize in the Leo to see an age
[1:34:28] that he makes us have known as deity out
[1:34:31] the amen it's God putting an amen
[1:34:35] on a message
[1:34:40] that this is the final word
[1:34:43] this is not another message coming
[1:34:46] this is the final message
[1:34:49] to the final age
[1:34:52] and I want you to know we don't need to
[1:34:54] look for another
[1:34:57] no age to age no eighth messenger
[1:35:00] nothing Beyond this this is Christ in
[1:35:03] his fullness revealing himself in his
[1:35:06] word
[1:35:08] now so as we look at it
[1:35:11] that he as he said the holy spirit is
[1:35:14] coming to church to give the signs
[1:35:16] discernment why do we know this right
[1:35:18] because it's the same spirit with the
[1:35:20] same action with the same signs with the
[1:35:22] same wonders with the same power and the
[1:35:24] same all that that was in the early
[1:35:26] churches in this church discernment of
[1:35:29] spirit prophecy tongues interpretation
[1:35:31] Divine healing powers and then he said
[1:35:35] why it'll take a born-again church to
[1:35:37] believe that
[1:35:40] that's all I'm saying let me just repeat
[1:35:42] what he said it'll take a born-again
[1:35:45] church
[1:35:46] to believe that
[1:35:48] now in the sermon who is this
[1:35:51] brother Branham is showing again that
[1:35:53] his his ministry is the farmer rain
[1:35:58] and remember it was the ministry of
[1:36:01] Christ repeating
[1:36:03] It Was preparing the way for Christ to
[1:36:07] come
[1:36:08] in bright form in a book of Acts Church
[1:36:12] now in the message who is this the
[1:36:15] Pharisees said who is he look look let's
[1:36:17] just take it from the context of Matthew
[1:36:20] 21 19. Matthew 21 19 and the multitude
[1:36:24] that went before that followed Christ
[1:36:26] saying Hosanna to the son of David
[1:36:29] blessed is he that cometh in the name of
[1:36:31] the Lord Hosanna to the highest and when
[1:36:34] he was coming to Jerusalem all the city
[1:36:37] was moved saying who is this
[1:36:40] now brother Branham in his sermon is
[1:36:42] answering who this is
[1:36:46] what is all this noise about
[1:36:48] you know what it's it's kind of a
[1:36:51] parallel sermon to the sermon in 65 but
[1:36:54] what is the attraction on the mountain
[1:36:56] you see they knew he was he said this
[1:36:59] question today when you see him come and
[1:37:01] stand in the meeting the Holy Spirit
[1:37:03] give a person enough Faith to speak to
[1:37:06] another and hear and tell them exactly
[1:37:08] all about his life what could do that
[1:37:10] whatever did do it never did until Jesus
[1:37:15] came and never has been since then what
[1:37:19] is it the former Reign coming into the
[1:37:22] latter rain
[1:37:24] now get an understanding not only not
[1:37:27] only did Jeremiah and Ezekiel and all of
[1:37:30] them never have that same Ministry of
[1:37:32] Jesus that would stand there to at the
[1:37:35] woman of the well and said you know
[1:37:36] you've had five and the one that you're
[1:37:38] living with not your husband and and
[1:37:40] tell her all about her life are you with
[1:37:42] me I mean not Not only was it Peter you
[1:37:45] know he he said to your your your your
[1:37:48] peter or your name is Simon you're the
[1:37:51] son of Jonas but I'm going to call you
[1:37:53] Peter
[1:37:54] you know I've never had there been
[1:37:56] another it had never happened before
[1:37:58] when when you were praying on the
[1:38:00] victory I saw you
[1:38:03] never had this ministry even though they
[1:38:05] had been great Ministries let me tell
[1:38:07] you we have had great man like Paul
[1:38:09] ireneus Martin Colombo Luther Wesley all
[1:38:12] the way down to this last age and never
[1:38:15] have we seen until this age the ministry
[1:38:18] of Christ repeat again
[1:38:21] why did he do that to identified the
[1:38:25] word was present
[1:38:26] not that brother Branham was the word
[1:38:28] but he was bringing the word back again
[1:38:32] there's a restoration of the word
[1:38:39] now
[1:38:41] so he says
[1:38:43] and the people called you crazy
[1:38:46] the people that's called you crazy
[1:38:48] sometimes you just had to hold on with
[1:38:51] teeth and toenails as we called it
[1:38:53] trying to hold on what you knew is right
[1:38:55] I think that that kind of describes
[1:38:57] where we've been
[1:38:59] hanging on with teeth and toenails
[1:39:01] remember because you're trying to hold
[1:39:03] on what you knew is right
[1:39:05] now the holy he said now the Holy Ghost
[1:39:08] has come right back around and confirmed
[1:39:10] with the former Reign into the lattering
[1:39:12] to prove it was his move and they're
[1:39:13] both falling together I wish you could
[1:39:15] see that the great move of God that
[1:39:17] started back 40 years ago back Yonder
[1:39:20] when the latter rain began to fall the
[1:39:22] former rain the former power that
[1:39:23] started with Jesus Christ has come into
[1:39:25] this church and proven he is the same
[1:39:28] Jesus Christ
[1:39:30] and then again in this prayer he says we
[1:39:34] know that Jesus is on his road and we're
[1:39:37] beginning to Congress Aid ourselves to
[1:39:39] the gate the Gate of the power of God
[1:39:42] those who believe in God those who are
[1:39:44] born of his Spirit those who have the
[1:39:46] Holy Ghost they know that the Holy Ghost
[1:39:48] is the spirit of God and he's the same
[1:39:50] yesterday today and forever and he
[1:39:52] cannot change his nature and when God
[1:39:56] comes into people
[1:39:57] it makes them believe for the impossible
[1:40:01] it produces the same kind of fruits that
[1:40:04] the former rain produced because it is
[1:40:07] the former rain mixed with the latter
[1:40:10] rain and the world cries out who is this
[1:40:14] so he's identified now who this is
[1:40:17] and what has taken place
[1:40:20] and and so he said he's the same Jesus
[1:40:24] that was back there two thousand years
[1:40:26] ago in the former Reign when a woman
[1:40:29] touched His Garment
[1:40:33] the form of rain was falling
[1:40:36] now
[1:40:38] as he finishes this sermon
[1:40:40] he affirms again that this unique
[1:40:43] Ministry like Jesus had that has not
[1:40:46] been seen in a continuous Ministry since
[1:40:49] the days of Christ
[1:40:51] that it is the former reign
[1:40:55] and with it
[1:40:57] will come the latter rain
[1:41:02] that we're not just going to just have
[1:41:04] the former rain
[1:41:06] and not have a ladder ring to follow
[1:41:09] foreign
[1:41:10] so he he is Discerning now and he said
[1:41:13] here's two men sitting right here and
[1:41:15] looking at me right back to that one
[1:41:17] looking sideways he was sympathizing
[1:41:20] with the prayer line the other was
[1:41:21] looking up like that with his eyes
[1:41:22] closed praying
[1:41:24] your prostate trouble has ceased sir you
[1:41:27] that raised your hand just stand just
[1:41:29] because you believe put your hands on
[1:41:31] the man next to you the elderly man
[1:41:33] there he has a sinus trouble that's
[1:41:34] bothering him that's right sir
[1:41:37] that's right raise your hand and go home
[1:41:40] both of you and be well from your
[1:41:43] trouble in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:41:44] he said what is it it's the former rain
[1:41:48] coming into the Pentecostal move is the
[1:41:50] latter rain being poured out together in
[1:41:52] the last day God said he would do it in
[1:41:54] the same month
[1:41:55] some would you see the prophet's
[1:41:57] expectation
[1:41:58] that with the former rain there has to
[1:42:02] also be a ladder rain
[1:42:06] now again the former Reign is Discerning
[1:42:10] the thoughts and intents of heart
[1:42:12] it's showing the presence of the word
[1:42:16] but it is making the way and we'll get
[1:42:19] into it a minute it is planting the seed
[1:42:22] for a harvest to come
[1:42:26] now so again that you know he goes into
[1:42:29] it he says he said how do you do I'm a
[1:42:32] stranger to you not to him but not to
[1:42:35] him we both know him because you're a
[1:42:37] Christian sister if I could help you and
[1:42:39] wouldn't do it I'd be evil but I cannot
[1:42:41] do no more than surrender myself to the
[1:42:43] will of God and let him speak what he
[1:42:46] says you have an allergy a spasmodic
[1:42:49] intestinal colon the doctor said that's
[1:42:52] right that's your trouble you believe
[1:42:53] with all your heart if you thou cans
[1:42:55] believe all things are possible Miss
[1:42:57] Andrews that's right you're from Oakland
[1:42:59] now go home it's finished Jesus Christ
[1:43:02] makes you well could I do that no
[1:43:04] certainly I could not it's the spirit of
[1:43:06] God and that's the reason the world says
[1:43:08] who is this
[1:43:11] it's the devil
[1:43:12] and that's what they said about him he's
[1:43:15] Beelzebub he's a fortune teller and let
[1:43:18] me tell you that's what the world still
[1:43:19] says about this message
[1:43:23] that brother Brandon was just a fortune
[1:43:25] teller or he was you know so operating
[1:43:28] some some will say it was a real spirit
[1:43:30] of God but he just didn't know how to
[1:43:32] teach and others will say well no it
[1:43:34] wasn't the spirit of God it was the
[1:43:35] devil upon him that's why he got off the
[1:43:37] word and they don't recognize who it is
[1:43:41] because they're exactly like they were 2
[1:43:44] 000 years ago
[1:43:46] some saying he's a fortune teller some
[1:43:48] saying he's you know that he's a beelze
[1:43:51] bomb that's chief of the Devils but then
[1:43:54] there's others saying No this is a
[1:43:56] Christ
[1:43:59] Hallelujah this is the word
[1:44:02] this is a message
[1:44:06] I happen to be speaking to some people
[1:44:08] this morning that no this is the message
[1:44:12] amen and we are saying Hosanna the Lord
[1:44:15] is coming the holy spirit is bearing
[1:44:17] record of his coming by putting the
[1:44:19] former Reign into the latter rain that
[1:44:21] we believe
[1:44:23] so he goes on in these in these things
[1:44:25] and talks in about it you know and and I
[1:44:28] I'm not going to go through all of them
[1:44:30] but he he deals within this again and
[1:44:33] Mary's belief Be not Afraid and after
[1:44:36] and several ones as he does but then
[1:44:40] here comes the book
[1:44:42] and the book is opened
[1:44:46] before
[1:44:48] the book is open he's probing not the
[1:44:50] book like everybody else
[1:44:54] but why
[1:44:58] but when if the seven Thunders revealing
[1:45:01] the Seven Seals to brother Branham
[1:45:02] that's the voice of God reveal them to
[1:45:04] Seven Seals
[1:45:05] if that you know if if that didn't
[1:45:09] happen to brother Branham he was not the
[1:45:11] seventh angel
[1:45:14] in order to be the seventh angel of
[1:45:16] Revelation 10 7 he had to hear the voice
[1:45:20] of God revealing the seals the Mysteries
[1:45:23] that are contained in the book
[1:45:28] and by you being able to receive it
[1:45:30] shows that you are the people of the
[1:45:32] book
[1:45:38] just like Israel being able to recognize
[1:45:40] their place in the Homeland the people
[1:45:42] of the book had returned to the land of
[1:45:44] the book and the same thing has happened
[1:45:46] in our day
[1:45:48] you the people of the book
[1:45:51] that was prophesied in the Bible
[1:45:55] Hallelujah have returned to the land of
[1:45:58] the book
[1:46:00] [Applause]
[1:46:01] and now every promise in this book is
[1:46:06] your promise
[1:46:10] Hallelujah don't matter he's a miracle
[1:46:13] science wonders gifts amen the Mysteries
[1:46:17] revealed whatever it is it's all your
[1:46:20] promise it's your land and it's for your
[1:46:24] taking
[1:46:24] [Applause]
[1:46:31] now
[1:46:33] but when the seals are open
[1:46:36] brother Branham has a different
[1:46:37] Viewpoint of azusa's treat
[1:46:40] because now he sees them
[1:46:42] as a move of God yes
[1:46:45] as a part of the wheat plant yes
[1:46:49] but not the grain
[1:46:51] but a shock
[1:46:54] and they're not the long-awaited
[1:46:56] restoration that has been promised
[1:47:00] so we already know already oh this is
[1:47:03] the street is not the latter rain
[1:47:05] no more than they are the original grain
[1:47:10] now they of course believe they are
[1:47:14] which is why they call themselves
[1:47:16] Pentecostals
[1:47:18] because they believe they are the
[1:47:20] Pentecostals restored
[1:47:23] but I'm looking at you today
[1:47:25] and I'm saying no
[1:47:29] you are the true Pentecostals
[1:47:32] restored
[1:47:33] I'm looking out this morning at a book
[1:47:36] of Acts Church
[1:47:41] now so again he realizes they're not to
[1:47:45] see but the shock
[1:47:47] and that they cannot I want to get this
[1:47:50] they cannot
[1:47:52] carry the restored word forward to the
[1:47:55] rapture
[1:47:57] no more than you can go pick a bunch of
[1:47:59] shots
[1:48:02] and harvest them
[1:48:05] it's the grain that is harvested
[1:48:10] but they cannot carry it onto the
[1:48:13] Rapture but rather they will reject it
[1:48:15] and the seed will not be Heir together
[1:48:18] with the shock
[1:48:21] now yet he saw that the Great Commission
[1:48:24] had to be finished and I want to drill
[1:48:26] this in for a moment the Great
[1:48:28] Commission
[1:48:30] brother Brandon would tell us right to
[1:48:32] the end of his ministry that that the
[1:48:35] apostolic age is not ceased and that the
[1:48:39] Great Commission is in effect
[1:48:42] amen and it has to be finished
[1:48:48] now it was 1965 in November
[1:48:52] and brother Brandon is about to leave
[1:48:56] like I told you I read a book on
[1:48:59] John F uh no Abraham Lincoln by O'Reilly
[1:49:04] and and he would he would take the last
[1:49:07] 10 days of Lincoln's life
[1:49:09] and the man that was to live nine more
[1:49:12] days done this and this and thus
[1:49:14] made me think of brother Branham
[1:49:17] what was God trying to impart to us
[1:49:20] in some of those last messages
[1:49:23] before he would call his Prophet home
[1:49:27] and and he here in 1965 in November he
[1:49:31] preaches a sermon and he said I'm doing
[1:49:34] this this is out of the ordinary for me
[1:49:37] but brother Jack has some you know
[1:49:40] always gave me an open pulpit and said
[1:49:42] preach what you want and I'm really
[1:49:44] going to take my Liberty and I'm going
[1:49:46] to preach to my church today
[1:49:49] the people that believe my message
[1:49:51] and he preaches a sermon the invisible
[1:49:53] Union of the Bride and he said here he
[1:49:57] was as he says the Great Commission had
[1:50:01] not been finished
[1:50:03] and he says it can't be done
[1:50:06] and let me just say it could not be done
[1:50:10] until the original Gospel of Jesus that
[1:50:14] Paul and the apostles preached was
[1:50:18] restored
[1:50:21] you know again when you you have the
[1:50:25] gospel The Gospel According to the
[1:50:27] Baptist The Gospel According to the
[1:50:29] Pentecostals The Gospel According to the
[1:50:31] Methodist but we had to come back to the
[1:50:34] original gospel
[1:50:36] to be restored in order to finish up the
[1:50:41] Great Commission
[1:50:44] because a Baptist gospel is not going to
[1:50:47] do it a Pentecostal gospel is another
[1:50:48] it'll take the original gospel
[1:50:52] to be preached again
[1:50:54] and restored to the church in order to
[1:50:58] fulfill the Great Commission
[1:51:01] and that couldn't happen until a prophet
[1:51:03] messenger came
[1:51:05] because the word the Lord never comes to
[1:51:08] theologians
[1:51:10] the word the Lord comes to prophet
[1:51:14] it is not a reformer it had to be a
[1:51:17] prophet
[1:51:18] and to be a prophet he had to be a seer
[1:51:21] and as a Seer he could see what was in
[1:51:25] the word by divine revelation rather
[1:51:29] than seeking it out in the theology it's
[1:51:32] his theology out in a in in a seminary
[1:51:37] now
[1:51:39] so he saw he he was emphatic now I want
[1:51:41] to go this for a moment
[1:51:43] in Mark 13 10 the gospel must be first
[1:51:48] published among all nations
[1:51:51] published also means to preach
[1:51:54] to be taught to preach in verse in Mark
[1:51:58] 16 verse 15 here's the Great Commission
[1:52:02] and this is what has to be finished
[1:52:06] look at your neighbor and say this has
[1:52:10] to be finished
[1:52:12] all right and he said unto them Mark 16
[1:52:15] 15. go into all the world and preach the
[1:52:18] gospel to every creature
[1:52:21] brother Brandon is insistent in his men
[1:52:24] in his ministry he said it's never been
[1:52:26] done
[1:52:28] they have not yet been able to do it we
[1:52:32] are here in a day an hour where it's
[1:52:34] being done
[1:52:37] understand the Bible tells us at the end
[1:52:40] time that travel and knowledge shall be
[1:52:43] increased and travel will be vastly
[1:52:45] increased right now my voice is going to
[1:52:48] cross the world that in real time
[1:52:49] they're hearing it over in South Africa
[1:52:52] that hearing it over and back have in
[1:52:54] dark Africa they're hearing it in Asia
[1:52:57] they're hearing it around the world in
[1:52:59] other states throughout the United
[1:53:01] States and in you know why how come well
[1:53:04] it is where you know rather than me
[1:53:07] getting on a boat
[1:53:09] and and taking a six-month journey to
[1:53:13] China
[1:53:15] right now it's so vastly increase my
[1:53:18] image my voice
[1:53:20] is going across the Airways of the world
[1:53:24] come on Amen and the gospel is being
[1:53:27] preached around the world so the end can
[1:53:31] come it could not happen until this day
[1:53:34] and God would even make sure this
[1:53:37] message got caught on magnetic tape
[1:53:44] amen so it could be available to the
[1:53:47] whole world
[1:53:49] come on church because God is determined
[1:53:52] that the Great Commission be fulfilled
[1:53:57] and I want to read you the Great
[1:53:59] Commission and he that believeth and
[1:54:01] baptized shall be saved he that
[1:54:04] believeth not shall be damned and these
[1:54:06] signs
[1:54:08] at these signs shall follow them that
[1:54:11] believe in my name they will cast out
[1:54:15] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[1:54:17] they shall take up serpents if they
[1:54:19] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[1:54:22] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:54:24] and they shall recover
[1:54:26] this is the Great Commission the gospel
[1:54:30] priests with power
[1:54:32] with demonstration
[1:54:35] not just a theology passed along
[1:54:42] not to recorded it
[1:54:46] in this way in Matthew 24 14 this Gospel
[1:54:50] of the Kingdom shall be preached in all
[1:54:52] the world for a witness
[1:54:53] unto all nations and then shall the End
[1:54:56] come how many wants the end to come
[1:54:58] we're living here
[1:55:00] understand you in your own way
[1:55:05] are Supernatural people
[1:55:10] things that was science fiction
[1:55:13] 75 years ago
[1:55:15] now our reality
[1:55:20] Dick Tracy with his watch with his you
[1:55:24] know all the other stuff I I never
[1:55:26] followed him but nevertheless you know
[1:55:28] with all the you know the science
[1:55:29] fiction we are now living it
[1:55:33] we Advanced into time and God has
[1:55:37] brought this about allowing knowledge to
[1:55:40] increase so this gospel could go into
[1:55:43] all the world so the end could come
[1:55:49] now let me just tell you it'll reach
[1:55:51] every predestinated seed that's the
[1:55:53] important thing
[1:55:54] it ain't it ain't that every person in
[1:55:57] the world will hear it
[1:55:59] but every predestinated seed will hear
[1:56:01] it
[1:56:02] so brother Branham says an invisible
[1:56:04] Union we know that the modern Church in
[1:56:06] his present condition its present States
[1:56:09] state is in no condition
[1:56:13] to finish up the Great Commission that
[1:56:16] God gave the church forth this day
[1:56:20] so God
[1:56:22] has given for the church and this day
[1:56:25] the job of finishing the Great
[1:56:28] Commission and he said the church can't
[1:56:32] do it
[1:56:34] now he said the reason he said he said
[1:56:37] we're Oneness with twoness with
[1:56:40] threeness with this that or the other we
[1:56:42] fight what is this one is that one is
[1:56:44] the other every one of them are afraid
[1:56:46] to face the word right down to the test
[1:56:50] so he further states that there has only
[1:56:53] been reformers to the last the past six
[1:56:56] ages until the seventh Age and and that
[1:56:59] Revelation 10 said it would change
[1:57:02] for in the days of the voice of the
[1:57:04] seventh angel when he begins the sound
[1:57:06] the mystery of God would be finished and
[1:57:09] it would take a prophet to finish the
[1:57:12] mystery not a reform her
[1:57:16] but a prophet to bring true restoration
[1:57:20] in the sermon invisible union he asks
[1:57:23] the question how many how many of the
[1:57:26] demand denominations or how could the
[1:57:28] denominations finish it up that Great
[1:57:31] Commission the life it left the stock is
[1:57:34] now in the grain God let them die he
[1:57:37] said so he can open his seven seal
[1:57:39] mystery to the undenominational bride
[1:57:44] why did we have to be an
[1:57:46] undenominational bride because
[1:57:48] denominations set up their their fences
[1:57:54] and they set up that book of Creeds and
[1:57:57] they put a period to it and you can't go
[1:58:00] beyond it so it would have to be taught
[1:58:02] whatever the headquarters say
[1:58:05] that's why we answered at no
[1:58:07] headquarters
[1:58:09] amen our headquarters into Inglorious
[1:58:11] it's not in Jeffersonville it's not in
[1:58:14] Tucson it's not in Cloverdale it's not
[1:58:16] in Happy Valley which ain't Happy Valley
[1:58:18] no more it's unhappy Valley because
[1:58:20] they've left become Word of Life
[1:58:27] but it's not there that's not our
[1:58:28] headquarters
[1:58:30] our headquarters are in heaven
[1:58:33] and it had to be given to an
[1:58:35] undenominational bride and he said
[1:58:38] because how
[1:58:39] could a denomination accept the open and
[1:58:42] the Seven Seals when the mystery truce
[1:58:44] of the Bible like serpent seed is
[1:58:47] contrary to their dogmas and their
[1:58:48] articles of faith you know they'd rather
[1:58:51] believe that
[1:58:52] a magic apple is what a evade
[1:58:56] and she got it from a talking snake
[1:59:01] they'd rather believe some fiction story
[1:59:04] come on amen you but but the truths of
[1:59:09] the Bible that we have received
[1:59:12] have been restored is contrary to what
[1:59:15] is taught in their Halls of learning
[1:59:17] that's why God could not send a trained
[1:59:20] theologian
[1:59:23] you people say well brother Brandon was
[1:59:25] uneducated and he he wasn't
[1:59:28] um he wasn't a theologian praise God
[1:59:33] if he was a theologian we'd still be in
[1:59:35] the mess we were
[1:59:37] like the other 40 000 denominations out
[1:59:40] there that have formed on different
[1:59:42] views of forty thousand different
[1:59:44] theologians
[1:59:46] but God sent a prophet
[1:59:49] and he confirmed it with signs following
[1:59:51] with the ministry of Christ that we
[1:59:54] could see that God was saying Amen to
[1:59:57] the word that was being brought so that
[2:00:00] you would know what is the truth
[2:00:03] because how else will you you would
[2:00:06] spend a whole lifetime going through
[2:00:08] forty thousand different denominations
[2:00:10] to discern which one was right
[2:00:12] and God Did It For You by vindicating a
[2:00:16] message
[2:00:17] so that you would be without a doubt
[2:00:21] No Doubt
[2:00:23] this is God Only God can do this and if
[2:00:27] God knows my heart if God knows my name
[2:00:29] and God knows where I come from then God
[2:00:32] can take a prophet all the way back
[2:00:34] to the back part of his mind and show
[2:00:37] Who You Are
[2:00:39] and what is promise for this age
[2:00:43] so that's why God would sin not a chain
[2:00:45] theologian
[2:00:50] it had to be revealed
[2:00:53] also to a bright elect to people outside
[2:00:57] of denominations
[2:00:59] because denominations
[2:01:02] would not
[2:01:03] receive the word
[2:01:06] therefore they could not
[2:01:08] take it to the world
[2:01:10] can you depend on the Baptist Church
[2:01:14] to take baptism in the name of Jesus
[2:01:16] Christ
[2:01:18] and one God
[2:01:19] to the world
[2:01:23] can you depend on the trinitarian
[2:01:25] Assemblies of God to do that
[2:01:31] then who's going to do it
[2:01:33] who's going to take the truth
[2:01:36] that have been restored listen I want to
[2:01:38] get something clear to you
[2:01:40] these are not new truths
[2:01:46] what we believe is not some Mormon
[2:01:50] doctrine that we had to write in another
[2:01:52] Bible
[2:01:54] to be able to work it in
[2:01:56] what we received in this day was the
[2:01:59] Gospel that Paul preached that Jesus
[2:02:01] preached that Peter preached restored
[2:02:04] again and Vindicated by the holy ghost
[2:02:07] that this is the original word
[2:02:10] [Applause]
[2:02:17] they can never take it to the world
[2:02:20] and the Great Commission has to be
[2:02:21] fulfilled
[2:02:22] the gospel had to be restored
[2:02:25] the Gospel of Jesus Christ that Paul
[2:02:27] preached
[2:02:30] The Taking of the of the Gospel though
[2:02:33] is not in word only
[2:02:35] that's only half of it
[2:02:39] it must also have the anointing let's go
[2:02:42] back and look at the original gospel as
[2:02:44] Jesus priesthood Matthew 4 and verse 23
[2:02:47] and Jesus went all went about all
[2:02:51] Galilee featuring in their synagogues
[2:02:52] preaching and the the gospel of the
[2:02:54] kingdom and healing all manners of
[2:02:57] sickness and all manner of diseases
[2:02:58] among the people notice he preached and
[2:03:02] healed
[2:03:05] notice this all men of sickness all men
[2:03:08] are diseases
[2:03:09] so Jesus ministry was not it did not
[2:03:13] just come with a theology
[2:03:16] it came with power this was the original
[2:03:19] gospel
[2:03:20] verse 24 it says in his Fame went
[2:03:24] throughout all Syria and they brought
[2:03:26] into him all sick people that were taken
[2:03:28] with diverse diseases and torments and
[2:03:31] those that were possessed with devils
[2:03:33] and those that were lunatic and those
[2:03:35] that had the palsy and he healed them
[2:03:37] this is the gospel
[2:03:41] this is the Great Commission
[2:03:44] to preach this gospel
[2:03:48] Matthew chapter 9 verse 20 to 33 and
[2:03:51] Jesus went about all the cities and
[2:03:53] Villages teaching in their synagogues
[2:03:55] and preaching the gospel of the kingdom
[2:03:57] and healing every sickness and ever
[2:03:59] disease among the people
[2:04:01] and John would wonder
[2:04:04] if he's truly the Messiah
[2:04:06] are you truly the one
[2:04:09] while he's in jail his old Eagle Eye got
[2:04:11] filled over filmed over
[2:04:14] in Matthew 9 35 and Jesus went about all
[2:04:16] the cities of then the villages and
[2:04:19] teaching in their synagogues and
[2:04:20] preaching the gospel healing every
[2:04:23] sickness and disease among the people
[2:04:26] and then and then the Bible said that
[2:04:29] you know he said go tell John
[2:04:32] he tells he said go tell John listen the
[2:04:36] sick is healed
[2:04:39] amen devils are cast out
[2:04:42] the poor has the gospel preached to them
[2:04:46] come on Church
[2:04:47] this is why he said you know this is the
[2:04:50] gospel being preached
[2:04:52] notice in Mark chapter 1 and verse 27 he
[2:04:56] they were amazed in so much that they
[2:04:59] questioned Among Us themselves saying
[2:05:01] what is this what new doctrine is this
[2:05:04] for with authority he commandeth even
[2:05:07] the unclean spirits and they do obey him
[2:05:12] wow
[2:05:14] his Doctrine had power with it
[2:05:18] it wasn't just a cold Creed
[2:05:21] a powerless gospel come on somebody
[2:05:24] hey man some people are sometimes afraid
[2:05:27] to uh come into the Youth Camp because
[2:05:29] they hear Devils get cast out you better
[2:05:31] you better believe they get cast out
[2:05:34] but that ought not be something strange
[2:05:39] amen that shouldn't be something that
[2:05:42] shocks people oh there's Devil's can't
[2:05:45] stop there we may not want to go to that
[2:05:46] meeting because we don't know about the
[2:05:48] strains that's the gospel
[2:05:55] Hallelujah that's why I say the
[2:05:58] principal's job of the church
[2:06:01] ought to be casting out Devils when
[2:06:04] people are saved devils are cast out
[2:06:07] mind isn't Changed by psychology or by
[2:06:11] some teaching that they can form Devils
[2:06:14] or Castile and their nature is changed
[2:06:19] when people are healed devils are cast
[2:06:22] out when cancers leave devils are cast
[2:06:24] out
[2:06:29] that's the job of the church
[2:06:36] Matthew 27 28 we're talking about the
[2:06:39] gospel
[2:06:40] we're talking about the gospel the Great
[2:06:42] Commission
[2:06:43] the Great Commission
[2:06:46] and it came to pass when Jesus
[2:06:48] ended these Saiyans and people were
[2:06:50] astonished at his Doctrine
[2:06:52] oh wow he he really boy he's really deep
[2:06:56] ain't he he he man he's he I
[2:07:01] I don't know I'm a little more confused
[2:07:03] than I ever was you know I that's so
[2:07:05] deep it's over my head for he taught
[2:07:07] them as one who had Authority
[2:07:10] and not as describes
[2:07:15] who just read quotes
[2:07:22] first
[2:07:23] 32 of Luke 4.
[2:07:26] and they were astonished at his Doctrine
[2:07:29] for his word was with power
[2:07:35] go back to the Great Commission verse 15
[2:07:38] of chapter 16 of Mark
[2:07:41] he said unto them going all the world
[2:07:42] and preach the gospel to Every Creature
[2:07:44] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[2:07:46] be saved that he that believeth not
[2:07:48] shall be down and these signs shall
[2:07:52] follow
[2:07:53] them that believe
[2:07:56] oh brother Tim we're not a seek sign he
[2:07:58] didn't say we would seek signs he said
[2:08:00] they would follow us
[2:08:08] and if there's real Believers Sun's
[2:08:10] going to follow real Believers now let
[2:08:13] me explain something
[2:08:15] just so that you don't get everything
[2:08:18] out you know a skewed or messed up
[2:08:22] brother Branham has asked the question
[2:08:23] by Florence shakarian
[2:08:25] brother Branham
[2:08:28] I fast and I pray and I fast and I pray
[2:08:31] and I still can't cast out devils
[2:08:35] he says sister you wasn't called to cast
[2:08:37] out Devils you were called to fast and
[2:08:40] pray While others cast out devils
[2:08:44] then he answers a question in question
[2:08:46] the answer 64. will every believer do
[2:08:49] this
[2:08:50] or is it among Believers he said I like
[2:08:52] that it's among Believers no ever
[2:08:54] believer doesn't do this
[2:08:56] but it's among believers
[2:08:58] so if we are real Church
[2:09:01] that's gonna be among believers
[2:09:04] maybe you never will have the gift of
[2:09:07] speaking in tongues you may never speak
[2:09:08] in tongues in all your life some people
[2:09:10] never do but I'll tell you the prophet
[2:09:13] of God said if you lay under the altar
[2:09:14] of God long enough sooner or later you
[2:09:16] will
[2:09:18] some of you just hadn't laid on the
[2:09:20] altar of God long enough
[2:09:23] if you did you would
[2:09:27] amen well it's not to sign the Holy
[2:09:29] Ghost no
[2:09:30] but it's one of the signs of the Holy
[2:09:32] Ghost
[2:09:36] is one of the signs that follows and
[2:09:37] believers they will speak with new
[2:09:41] tongues
[2:09:43] they shall take up serpents
[2:09:46] and if they drink any deadly thing it'll
[2:09:48] not hurt them I'll tell you you need
[2:09:50] that scripture more than ever
[2:09:52] every time you take a appeal or even an
[2:09:55] herb or a vitamin
[2:09:59] you're taking some kind of poison into
[2:10:01] your body
[2:10:03] come on somebody and you're gonna you're
[2:10:07] gonna need a lot of faith to go with
[2:10:09] what you're swallowing down
[2:10:12] that's why I say you know oh you you
[2:10:14] take treatment for cancer that's fine
[2:10:16] that's no problem with that the Bible
[2:10:17] said we took something deadly it
[2:10:19] wouldn't hurt us pray over every dose of
[2:10:21] it
[2:10:24] amen now you see they shall take up
[2:10:27] servants they drink any deadly thing
[2:10:29] it'll not hurt them they lay hands on
[2:10:31] the sick so every time Jesus
[2:10:33] commissioned and sent them out even
[2:10:36] before the Holy Ghost came in Luke
[2:10:38] chapter 9 and 6 and they departed and
[2:10:41] went into towns preaching the gospel and
[2:10:43] healing everywhere
[2:10:45] Luke chapter 10 verse 19 behold I give
[2:10:48] unto you power to tread on serpents and
[2:10:51] scorpions and over all the power of the
[2:10:53] enemy and nothing shall by any means
[2:10:56] hurt you
[2:10:57] Paul said in first Thessalonians 1 and 5
[2:11:00] for Our Gospel came not unto you in word
[2:11:02] only
[2:11:04] but also in power and in the Holy Ghost
[2:11:07] and in much assurance
[2:11:09] Romans 5 15 19 by the power of signs and
[2:11:13] wonders by the power of the spirit of
[2:11:15] God so from Jerusalem all the way around
[2:11:17] to uh
[2:11:19] ill there would come I I have fully
[2:11:22] proclaimed the gospel of Christ so to
[2:11:24] fully Proclaim or preach the gospel of
[2:11:28] Christ it has to be not in word only but
[2:11:32] through Mighty signs and wonders by the
[2:11:34] power of the spirit
[2:11:37] I'm trying to get you
[2:11:39] to understand
[2:11:42] there's a bride in this last day that
[2:11:45] has a commission
[2:11:46] to fulfill
[2:11:51] don't be satisfied with just being a
[2:11:54] bench warmer and a denominational church
[2:11:57] member
[2:12:01] that's why that's why sometimes we
[2:12:03] encourage you just get enough steam to
[2:12:05] let it out to whistle at least you got
[2:12:07] some steam
[2:12:09] some people have been dead for years
[2:12:13] they only come to this church as an
[2:12:15] observer they're not a participator
[2:12:18] they're Baxley at dying right on the pew
[2:12:21] oh I know you don't like me to preach
[2:12:23] that way but that's your problem you're
[2:12:24] dead
[2:12:25] you need a filling of the Holy Ghost you
[2:12:28] need the power of Christ to come in your
[2:12:30] life and charge you give me a passion
[2:12:34] give you a drive on the inside of you
[2:12:37] amen give you something that responds to
[2:12:39] the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[2:12:42] I found
[2:12:45] Hallelujah
[2:12:49] First Corinthians 4 and 20 for the
[2:12:51] kingdom of God is not in word but in
[2:12:53] power
[2:12:55] oh
[2:12:57] second Corinthians three and six who had
[2:12:59] made us able Ministers of the New
[2:13:01] Testament not of the letter but of the
[2:13:03] spirit for the letter killeth but the
[2:13:05] spirit giveth life so we are ministers
[2:13:07] of the spirit not Ministers of the
[2:13:09] letter
[2:13:10] I just read it to you
[2:13:13] when we have letter only you kill the
[2:13:17] spirit
[2:13:19] you see Satan wants to get in the church
[2:13:22] and make it all mechanics and no
[2:13:24] Dynamics are all Dynamics and no
[2:13:26] mechanics
[2:13:32] that's what he wants to do with your
[2:13:34] life
[2:13:35] make you just one or the other
[2:13:37] a bird with one Wings can't get off the
[2:13:40] ground
[2:13:41] it takes spirit and Truth
[2:13:45] amen
[2:13:46] now so to fulfill the Great Commission
[2:13:49] cannot be with word only
[2:13:52] well brother Tim we got the message we
[2:13:54] got the theology we got the original
[2:13:56] Doctrine hallelujah amen we do
[2:14:00] but yet the gospel must be taught and
[2:14:03] preached and yet is not truly preached
[2:14:07] until it's demonstrated
[2:14:11] amen Mark 16 verse 20 and they went
[2:14:15] forth after receiving the Great
[2:14:16] Commission they went forth and preached
[2:14:19] everywhere the Lord working with them
[2:14:21] and confirming the word with signs
[2:14:23] following
[2:14:24] hello
[2:14:26] somebody said well we don't need the
[2:14:28] word confirmed anymore it's already been
[2:14:30] confirmed every time the word is
[2:14:31] preached
[2:14:33] it has to be confirmed that this is the
[2:14:36] word
[2:14:37] and that happens with Souls being saved
[2:14:40] come on
[2:14:41] amen with Devils being cast out the sick
[2:14:45] healed the dead raised the blind eyes
[2:14:47] open everything else that the Bible says
[2:14:52] so now
[2:14:55] by the time of the Seven Seals brother
[2:14:57] Branham realizes what he saw in Azusa
[2:15:00] movement though it looked like the
[2:15:02] latter rain was not the latter rain
[2:15:05] and what he saw there that looked like
[2:15:07] the grain was not the grain
[2:15:11] and then he tells us in the resume of
[2:15:13] the ages
[2:15:15] he said this age started just around the
[2:15:17] turn of the 20th century
[2:15:19] as it was to be the age in which the
[2:15:22] true church would return to be in the
[2:15:24] bride she was at Pentecost
[2:15:26] and we know we know there must
[2:15:31] of a necessity Bill return of dynamic
[2:15:35] power
[2:15:36] and so to be the bride she was at
[2:15:39] Pentecost
[2:15:40] there has to be of necessity a return of
[2:15:44] the dynamic power the Believers since
[2:15:46] this in their Spirit begin to cry and
[2:15:48] out for God for a new outporn us as it
[2:15:51] was in the first century back 2000 years
[2:15:53] ago and what seemed to be the answer oh
[2:15:56] they thought this was it
[2:15:58] came as many began to speak with tongues
[2:16:00] and manifest gifts of the Spirit and it
[2:16:03] was then believed that this was indeed a
[2:16:06] long-awaited restoration
[2:16:08] and it was not
[2:16:10] for it but the latter ring could come
[2:16:13] only after the former Reign which is the
[2:16:16] spring or cheating rain
[2:16:20] so it couldn't be the latter rain
[2:16:23] because he said the lattering is a
[2:16:25] harvest rain and how could this be the
[2:16:27] real thing the latter rain when the
[2:16:31] teaching Ray did not come before he says
[2:16:33] the prophet messenger who was sent to
[2:16:35] teach the people and turn the hearts of
[2:16:39] the children back to Pentecostal fathers
[2:16:41] had not come
[2:16:44] thus what was thought to be the
[2:16:46] restoration and final quickening to the
[2:16:48] Rapture had not come and then in it was
[2:16:51] a mixture of unrighteous particular
[2:16:53] spiritual blessings and then to prove it
[2:16:55] wasn't really said for this for the Next
[2:16:58] Generation they organized so this proved
[2:17:01] it was not the grain
[2:17:04] now what a disappointment
[2:17:07] what a disappointment
[2:17:09] but then what a what a revelation
[2:17:12] the latter rain had not come
[2:17:15] because before the lattering could come
[2:17:18] there had to come first the teaching
[2:17:21] reign
[2:17:22] and only after the teaching went forth
[2:17:27] could the latter rain come
[2:17:31] so the latter rain follows the message
[2:17:35] of Malachi 4.
[2:17:39] and can only come after our hearts are
[2:17:42] turned back to the faith or the original
[2:17:44] doctrines of the apostolic fathers
[2:17:47] and once returned to the gospel dim the
[2:17:50] Great Commission has to be finished
[2:17:54] not with just teach him but with signs
[2:17:56] following and God going with him
[2:17:59] confirming the words
[2:18:01] the commission cannot be fulfilled with
[2:18:05] just having correct Doctrine
[2:18:10] a correct theology taught
[2:18:13] it can only be fulfilled
[2:18:18] it can only be fulfilled when signs
[2:18:22] follow the Believers
[2:18:26] notice Let me just read a couple of
[2:18:28] these after a short and Powerful
[2:18:30] demonstration of this spirit this little
[2:18:34] hunted and persecuted group will go to
[2:18:36] be with Jesus
[2:18:39] this is the age in which the true church
[2:18:41] would return to be in the bride she was
[2:18:43] at Pentecost we know there must have
[2:18:45] necessity be returned to Dynamic power
[2:18:48] the original church with the power at
[2:18:51] Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16
[2:18:53] in action is the true church that Jesus
[2:18:56] claims is his own all else's fault
[2:18:58] Christ and the true church is a
[2:19:00] continuation of the book of Acts
[2:19:03] it is also a fact that the prophet of
[2:19:06] the last age must be bringing forth a
[2:19:08] message from God therefore run the
[2:19:10] second coming of the Lord for by his
[2:19:12] message will the hearts of the children
[2:19:14] be turned back to the Pentecostal
[2:19:17] fathers and with the restoration of the
[2:19:20] word will come the restoration of the
[2:19:22] power
[2:19:24] what the church had in Pentecost is her
[2:19:26] inalienable right originally she had the
[2:19:29] pure word of God she had the power of
[2:19:32] the spirit manifested in diverse signs
[2:19:34] and wonders and Gifts of the Holy Ghost
[2:19:38] so the Azusa movement
[2:19:41] although a movement of God
[2:19:45] was just more of a Reformation
[2:19:48] the restoration can only come through a
[2:19:52] prophet restoring the word Amos 3 and 7.
[2:19:54] let's put that up remember this is a
[2:19:57] Cornerstone scripture to understand
[2:20:00] surely the Lord God will do nothing
[2:20:04] but he revealeth his secrets to his
[2:20:07] servants and Prophets never theologians
[2:20:10] never Halls of learning
[2:20:12] never your favorite Bible College
[2:20:16] amen the only place that he reveals a
[2:20:19] secret is to his servants the prophets
[2:20:23] that's why the last messenger had to be
[2:20:27] a prophet
[2:20:29] Revelation 10 7 but in the days of the
[2:20:32] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[2:20:34] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[2:20:36] be finished as he had declared to his
[2:20:39] servants the prophets
[2:20:41] so all the prophets have declared it
[2:20:43] comes today that the mysteries of God
[2:20:45] would be finished
[2:20:46] you see actually Abraham and Sarah were
[2:20:51] prophesying of it Isaac would also and
[2:20:54] Rebecca would prophesy on their time
[2:20:56] Jacob would prophesy we could just go
[2:20:59] down to the Bible whether it be that of
[2:21:02] Enoch or Noah or any of the prophets
[2:21:04] were prophesying of this last name
[2:21:09] so now notice here you see but all of
[2:21:12] them were saying there's come a time
[2:21:15] where the mystery of God would be
[2:21:17] finished right now Abraham would say
[2:21:19] it's only in types and shadows boys but
[2:21:22] one day
[2:21:23] the Real's coming
[2:21:27] now
[2:21:28] so he said I want you to notice
[2:21:30] carefully here God has promised at the
[2:21:33] end time Malachi 4 is going to be
[2:21:36] fulfilled
[2:21:37] it has to be for it is a spirit
[2:21:40] quickened word of God spoken by the
[2:21:43] prophet Malachi Jesus referred to it it
[2:21:46] is just before Christ comes the second
[2:21:48] time by the time Jesus comes all
[2:21:51] scripture must be fulfilled I want you
[2:21:54] to get that down under your fifth rib
[2:21:56] by the time Jesus comes
[2:22:00] every scripture speaking of a bride has
[2:22:03] to be fulfilled
[2:22:04] whether it be extra whether it be
[2:22:07] Rebecca whether it be Mary Magdalene
[2:22:09] whether it be the book of Acts come on
[2:22:11] somebody
[2:22:12] every prophecy come on you got to start
[2:22:16] looking at the Bible it's speaking of
[2:22:19] you
[2:22:21] it's not just our history it's talking
[2:22:24] about you
[2:22:26] [Applause]
[2:22:33] Abraham was the prophecy Sarah was the
[2:22:36] prophecy you're the Fulfillment
[2:22:41] Esther was a prophecy
[2:22:44] but you are here at such a time as this
[2:22:48] Hallelujah to go before the king
[2:22:53] Esther realize who you are you're the
[2:22:55] queen
[2:22:57] you're not going to be rejected go
[2:22:59] boldly before the throne of grace
[2:23:02] Hallelujah go before the king Esther
[2:23:05] you're the queen realize who you are you
[2:23:09] are here for such a time as this
[2:23:11] [Applause]
[2:23:15] he's going to hold out
[2:23:18] the scepter he's going to welcome you
[2:23:20] into his presence you're not going to be
[2:23:23] rejected
[2:23:26] you're not going to be thrown out and
[2:23:27] condemned to die
[2:23:30] come boldly before the throne of grace
[2:23:32] you know who is this Melchizedek he's
[2:23:35] the high priest approach him
[2:23:40] so you see brother Bradham talks about
[2:23:43] all scripture must be fulfilled the
[2:23:45] Gentile dispensation will be in this
[2:23:48] last Church age
[2:23:50] when that messenger of Malachi comes he
[2:23:54] will be right with the word he will take
[2:23:57] the whole Bible from Genesis to
[2:23:59] revelation
[2:24:00] he will start at the serpent seed that's
[2:24:02] all the way in Genesis and carry on to
[2:24:04] the messenger in the latter rain he will
[2:24:07] be rejected by the denominations notice
[2:24:09] he says how could he how could the Azusa
[2:24:13] Revival be the latter rain and final
[2:24:15] quickening to the Rapture when the
[2:24:17] teaching Reign did not come the prophet
[2:24:20] messenger he was sent to teach the
[2:24:22] people and turn their hearts back to the
[2:24:24] Pentecost of fathers had not yet come
[2:24:27] so you you can see he was the Forerunner
[2:24:31] and he said the second Forerunner will
[2:24:34] sow the second Forerunner of Christ will
[2:24:37] sow for the latter Ray
[2:24:40] all the teaching he's doing
[2:24:44] is sowing seeds so when the latter ring
[2:24:48] comes it brings him to harvest
[2:24:52] so brother Brandon preaches a six-hour
[2:24:54] sermon
[2:24:57] I promise not to do that today
[2:25:02] but I may preach a third of it
[2:25:06] but he preaches a six-hour sermon on the
[2:25:08] spoken words of Original Seed
[2:25:11] and explains where he stood and he says
[2:25:13] what my mission is to the world
[2:25:17] and he said my mission I believe that
[2:25:20] God has called me before I have some
[2:25:21] personal things today because that's
[2:25:24] what I told you I would do and tell the
[2:25:26] world my mission I believe to the world
[2:25:28] is what to forerun the coming word
[2:25:31] the coming word which is Christ and in
[2:25:33] him in Christ in him has a millennium
[2:25:36] and everything right there because he is
[2:25:37] the word but I want you to understand
[2:25:39] the word the coming word would not just
[2:25:42] be theology but it would be Christ
[2:25:46] in bright form
[2:25:49] look back two thousand years ago Christ
[2:25:52] came in the groom form
[2:25:54] and he wants to work
[2:25:57] so in the last days Christ comes in
[2:26:01] Bride form
[2:26:03] who is the where
[2:26:06] amen the message ain't books and tape
[2:26:09] folks
[2:26:10] the messages of people they are the word
[2:26:14] made flesh
[2:26:20] they are the ones who prophesy again
[2:26:23] after eating the prophecy eating the
[2:26:27] book
[2:26:29] we've had the coming of the seventh
[2:26:31] angel
[2:26:32] we've had his message
[2:26:35] you're not going to like this some
[2:26:38] people are
[2:26:40] but brother Branham came to forerun
[2:26:42] you're coming
[2:26:50] he come to forerun you
[2:26:54] prepare the way for you
[2:26:57] for Christ to come in Bride form
[2:27:01] listen to me in spoken words for
[2:27:02] Original Seed as the end time prophecies
[2:27:05] will repeat I believe as the first
[2:27:07] Forerunner came from the Wilderness in
[2:27:09] Christ Behold the Lamb of God the second
[2:27:12] form of Honor will probably do the same
[2:27:14] by pointing the people to a word-born
[2:27:16] bride
[2:27:18] so the first one pointed out the groom
[2:27:20] said Behold the Lamb of God come on and
[2:27:24] he turns and and the lastful runner will
[2:27:27] do the same the first Forerunner did but
[2:27:29] this time he will point to a word born
[2:27:33] bride a bride who's been born of the
[2:27:37] word
[2:27:42] so he for run your coming
[2:27:45] he was prophesying there's a bride
[2:27:48] coming after me it's Christ
[2:27:52] but it's in bright form
[2:27:54] don't look for him in nail scars
[2:27:57] don't want to come for him walking down
[2:27:59] the shore to see a Galilee don't look
[2:28:02] for him in that manner come on
[2:28:05] here's what you want to see you want to
[2:28:07] see Christ is the mystery of God
[2:28:09] revealed that all that God was he born
[2:28:11] in Christ and all Christ was he pours
[2:28:13] into a church
[2:28:15] and that the church now is the mystery
[2:28:18] of Christ revealed
[2:28:20] why in the world did God do everything
[2:28:23] he's ever done to get a bride
[2:28:26] why did he make a world why did he make
[2:28:28] the heavens why did he come to Earth
[2:28:30] everything he's ever done is because of
[2:28:33] you
[2:28:33] [Applause]
[2:28:36] and he predestinated you would be here
[2:28:39] at this time
[2:28:42] to fulfill
[2:28:43] all prophecy
[2:28:45] as we stand in the water the word coming
[2:28:48] to the Prophet come on somebody and the
[2:28:51] spirit of God coming down as we declare
[2:28:54] it to cometh us to fulfill all prophecy
[2:29:03] a people who the bride who the word and
[2:29:06] the spirit rest in
[2:29:09] oh well that clock's too busy
[2:29:15] listen brother Brandon would preach the
[2:29:16] six-hour sermon
[2:29:18] the spoken words of Original Seed
[2:29:22] if you'll go back and listen to it
[2:29:24] and just take it paragraph by paragraph
[2:29:26] and listen just pour over it for a
[2:29:28] moment
[2:29:29] he's preaching that the Original Seed
[2:29:32] was Jesus Christ
[2:29:35] he's the word
[2:29:37] so the spoken word is the Original Seed
[2:29:40] and Christ came in order to be the
[2:29:44] original seed that every other seed
[2:29:46] would come through
[2:29:48] and he said there he came he was a seed
[2:29:50] he had the moisture the spirit within
[2:29:53] him he was both spirit and word and
[2:29:57] there at Calvary he poured out his life
[2:29:59] or his Spirit in order to give life to
[2:30:04] the word to ever spoken word of God has
[2:30:07] to come to life
[2:30:09] by the reign of God
[2:30:12] you talk about that Jesus was the
[2:30:14] original word John 1 and 1. so he was
[2:30:17] the original seed and from him came the
[2:30:20] spirit or the word to uh or or the world
[2:30:24] the excuse me came the spirit or the
[2:30:27] water to germinate every predestinated
[2:30:30] word of God
[2:30:32] and he said when he when Eve sinned it
[2:30:36] caused every one of you to be born
[2:30:38] illegitimate
[2:30:41] we look around sometimes that bastard
[2:30:43] child ain't gonna make it Rapture well
[2:30:45] you're the bastard child
[2:30:47] you were everyone born in sin shaping
[2:30:51] and iniquity came in the world in an
[2:30:54] illegitimate manner you were born to die
[2:30:58] every person born in this world will die
[2:31:02] if they were born of the sexual birth
[2:31:04] but Jesus came to breed out that high
[2:31:07] breeding that Eve did and give you a new
[2:31:10] birth and this time you're not born
[2:31:13] another human
[2:31:15] you are born a son or daughter of God
[2:31:18] amen and to be born of the water and the
[2:31:21] Spirit come on now both sight you like
[2:31:24] you should have been at the beginning
[2:31:26] [Applause]
[2:31:27] Hallelujah
[2:31:29] that's what the Holy Ghost did that I've
[2:31:31] done your natural birth
[2:31:36] and you're not a hyper drunch
[2:31:39] you're not a bunch that's gonna die
[2:31:41] you cannot die because you're at the
[2:31:45] Original Seed
[2:31:49] Hallelujah
[2:31:54] and there that Original Seed the spoken
[2:31:57] word God spoke a seed into existence
[2:32:01] Jesus Christ
[2:32:03] so out of him would come to life
[2:32:06] to water every other seed of God
[2:32:11] to birth you like you should have been
[2:32:13] born in the beginning
[2:32:16] so now when you're born again
[2:32:19] you are not born of corruptable seed
[2:32:23] but of the word of God that liveth and
[2:32:25] abideth forever
[2:32:27] you are the spoken word
[2:32:31] you are the original seed
[2:32:37] now that's why the word
[2:32:40] had to be planted
[2:32:41] now brother Branham tells us
[2:32:43] if we want
[2:32:45] the true church
[2:32:48] then he says you have to start with the
[2:32:50] word of God
[2:32:52] you want the light for God you got to
[2:32:54] start with the word of God you accept
[2:32:56] the word in his fullness every
[2:32:58] measurement that's the fullness of God
[2:33:00] in you then the rain
[2:33:02] that's falling will produce what's in
[2:33:04] your garden
[2:33:05] this is what the word had to be planted
[2:33:09] first
[2:33:11] in order to bring forth a word bride who
[2:33:15] is the original seed
[2:33:19] and understand so the word had to be
[2:33:21] planted first so the mystery truths had
[2:33:25] to be restored first
[2:33:28] now in other words the had to come a
[2:33:30] planting of the word before and and that
[2:33:34] would go forth in the former red
[2:33:37] there in the in the form of rain it
[2:33:40] comes there and it comes as as truths
[2:33:45] it comes as the word Vindicated
[2:33:49] but notice then it is only whatever's
[2:33:52] been planted is what's going to come up
[2:33:55] in the latter rain is what's going to
[2:33:57] manifest
[2:33:59] now so if you want the word then you
[2:34:02] gotta if you want a word bribe you got
[2:34:04] to start with the word
[2:34:06] that's why if you started with
[2:34:08] Pentecostalism if you started with
[2:34:10] baptism you're only going to get
[2:34:13] whatever you planted
[2:34:15] that's why the word had to be restored
[2:34:18] because if all we had was a Pentecostal
[2:34:21] word we were just in the latter rain get
[2:34:23] more Pentecostal children
[2:34:27] everybody plant the word that there's a
[2:34:31] word coming forth
[2:34:33] that'll be just like the Original Seed
[2:34:37] which is Jesus Christ
[2:34:39] now you only get what you plan to you
[2:34:43] can't plant you can't plant wheat and
[2:34:45] expect cucumbers
[2:34:47] the word must be planted
[2:34:50] because you can only give a harvest of
[2:34:52] the word if you plant the word
[2:34:55] if you hydrate it
[2:34:57] it's death
[2:35:00] that's why we do not want to mix
[2:35:04] denominationalism
[2:35:06] with the message
[2:35:09] that's why we don't walk
[2:35:13] are you with me we don't want psychology
[2:35:17] preached to fix our problems
[2:35:22] because that's all denomination has
[2:35:26] is the thinking of man of how to change
[2:35:28] the mind of man to how to reform a man
[2:35:31] this is not a Reformation this is a
[2:35:34] transformation
[2:35:36] and when you go and you mix the Creeds
[2:35:38] of man and the methods and
[2:35:40] denominationalism with the message of
[2:35:43] hybrid it and it'll never bring forth
[2:35:45] the original Crop
[2:35:49] that's why you can have all your
[2:35:51] sessions you want to of teaching men how
[2:35:53] to behave themselves sexually it ain't
[2:35:56] gonna do any good
[2:35:59] you've got to have a nature change
[2:36:06] but God's predestinated a bride a people
[2:36:10] they will have the mind of Christ in
[2:36:12] other words they will think like him
[2:36:13] they will agree with the word they will
[2:36:16] not disagree with the word they will be
[2:36:18] like they will be exactly like they were
[2:36:21] those predestinated seeds the apostles
[2:36:24] predestinated seed of God they had been
[2:36:26] taught the word of God somebody help me
[2:36:29] preach the gospel had been taught to
[2:36:31] them by Jesus Christ himself but they
[2:36:33] hauled themselves up into the upper room
[2:36:36] because the seed had been broken open to
[2:36:40] release the moisture the rain to come
[2:36:43] down on them here come the latter rain
[2:36:45] upon them to put in them the very life
[2:36:48] of Jesus Christ to repeat the same thing
[2:36:51] that he did in Bradford
[2:36:53] [Applause]
[2:36:55] so the same thing has to happen to you
[2:36:57] you've got to hold yourself up to the
[2:36:58] upper room so to speak and let the same
[2:37:01] light that was in Jesus come in you amen
[2:37:04] then it will the word of God will
[2:37:06] manifest itself
[2:37:09] now
[2:37:10] let me quickly kind of sum this up
[2:37:14] he said you know we've had a sowing rain
[2:37:19] he said Billy Graham has went forth with
[2:37:21] the Baptist
[2:37:23] for the evangelicals
[2:37:27] and he said he sowed his seed
[2:37:30] he's been a head planter
[2:37:33] and he said now this is kind of come
[2:37:36] into law
[2:37:37] in the Revival
[2:37:39] you don't hear very much of him
[2:37:41] all Roberts he said same thing
[2:37:45] he's been the head planners for the
[2:37:46] Pentecostals
[2:37:49] and he's planted the Pentecostal seed
[2:37:52] you realize out of that little Mission
[2:37:55] work of the Azusa Street Revival there
[2:37:59] are now 0.6 billion followers
[2:38:05] of Pentecost
[2:38:08] what happened the seed was planted
[2:38:12] but then he said
[2:38:14] same thing with me he said Divine Divine
[2:38:17] Healing movement the Revival is dying
[2:38:20] down
[2:38:21] and he said what is it it's been a time
[2:38:24] of planting seed he said
[2:38:26] the word has now been planted
[2:38:30] now
[2:38:31] so you have all kinds of seeds that are
[2:38:35] being sowed
[2:38:36] you know he even talks later about seeds
[2:38:39] of Communism he said this nation has
[2:38:42] been seated over with Communism well I
[2:38:44] guess you're seeing the Harvest
[2:38:50] amen what is it you know why we are in
[2:38:54] the time
[2:38:56] we're in the time where in the pouring
[2:38:58] out of God's spirit that is now
[2:39:00] manifesting what was planted
[2:39:04] so the Baptist right well bring forth
[2:39:07] you know Billy Graham would bring forth
[2:39:09] evangelicals and and the Pentecostals
[2:39:11] under all Roberts would bring forth
[2:39:13] Pentecost but whatever what kind of seed
[2:39:15] do you get
[2:39:17] Billy Graham would come and say hey I
[2:39:19] can preach and I have a thousand people
[2:39:22] come to Christ and and come back and I
[2:39:25] can't find 10.
[2:39:26] he said because denominational planting
[2:39:29] brings forth denominational children
[2:39:34] amen but he said the word is going to
[2:39:37] bring forth the word
[2:39:39] somebody with me now amen and he said I
[2:39:43] I have planted a seed I have planted the
[2:39:47] word for an end time Harvest
[2:39:52] Hallelujah and he said you're actually
[2:39:54] seeing your last sign before the
[2:39:57] promised son comes
[2:40:00] but guess how the promised son comes he
[2:40:03] does not come in the median in the air
[2:40:05] first he comes in Pride for him first
[2:40:08] because there has to be a lamb of God on
[2:40:12] Earth to match the lamb coming from
[2:40:14] heaven
[2:40:16] so that boy is the first Forerunner said
[2:40:18] Behold the Lamb of God therefore on
[2:40:21] herself Behold the Lamb of God because
[2:40:23] now there's a blind people on earth
[2:40:26] [Music]
[2:40:27] who is the wife of the lamb and species
[2:40:32] must marry species in kind after kind
[2:40:34] he's coming for the Lamb of God
[2:40:39] a people who demonstrate the Holy Ghost
[2:40:44] but this time
[2:40:45] this lamb is not going to be sacrificed
[2:40:49] this lamb is going to be raptured
[2:40:52] for a wedding in the sky
[2:40:57] Hallelujah
[2:41:02] we've had all kinds of waters
[2:41:04] had all kinds of revivals we've had all
[2:41:07] kinds of moves of the spirit
[2:41:10] but they have not been the latter rain
[2:41:14] the former rain
[2:41:16] brother Branham said was a teaching ring
[2:41:19] Billy Graham struck the world unto that
[2:41:21] Pentecostal struck the world and the
[2:41:25] word has struck the world
[2:41:28] so what's the matter now
[2:41:30] she's been waiting he says for the
[2:41:32] latter rain
[2:41:33] Pentecostals want more Pentecostals
[2:41:35] that's what they're going to get
[2:41:38] but the word is going to produce sons
[2:41:40] and daughters
[2:41:42] look at that great latter rain supposed
[2:41:44] to be done how they would run over the
[2:41:46] wall leap over they'd be an army coming
[2:41:51] come on he tells us in the churches but
[2:41:53] she's an invincible Army that Satan is
[2:41:57] powerless before her
[2:41:58] but he said she would run and leave over
[2:42:01] the wall and brother Madam talks about
[2:42:04] that wall he said it's a wall between
[2:42:06] the natural and the supernatural
[2:42:09] amen there are people that knows their
[2:42:12] God who does exploits
[2:42:18] no
[2:42:19] as we look like this
[2:42:24] remember
[2:42:25] for years men have tried to manufacture
[2:42:27] a lot of rain
[2:42:30] but he says a lot of rain
[2:42:32] won't be just a little move here or
[2:42:34] there
[2:42:35] it'll sweep the world
[2:42:38] and when Christ has been completely
[2:42:40] rejected and the world has shut their
[2:42:42] doors to it he said that's when he'll
[2:42:45] come
[2:42:46] that's when he'll show that's when
[2:42:48] you'll see a rain
[2:42:50] and we're right here in the final
[2:42:53] rejection in the laodice the rejection
[2:42:56] of Christ
[2:42:57] putting him on the outside of the church
[2:43:00] look at what America has done she has
[2:43:03] rejected Christ
[2:43:05] look at look she's been so communism
[2:43:09] until it's it's everywhere that you look
[2:43:12] Marxism going out in our schools in our
[2:43:15] society in every way that you want to
[2:43:17] look come on Church you know that
[2:43:20] amen why why is it that's what was
[2:43:22] planted
[2:43:24] amen but but you know there again
[2:43:27] 6.6 billion Pentecost 0.6 billion
[2:43:31] evangelicals you know there's a
[2:43:33] multitude without number that goes into
[2:43:35] the tribulation that winds up in the
[2:43:37] great white Throne judgment and God then
[2:43:39] will decide which one of them was really
[2:43:41] foolish virgins and what wouldn't
[2:43:44] at the white throne
[2:43:47] he'll be cast in the tribulation
[2:43:50] but I want to get to you the word has
[2:43:54] been planted
[2:44:00] and the next thing
[2:44:02] and I'm going to leave you right here on
[2:44:04] this
[2:44:05] because I don't have time to bring it
[2:44:07] out
[2:44:07] the next thing
[2:44:11] is the rain coming
[2:44:14] with rapturing faith
[2:44:20] and I'm not talking about
[2:44:23] a theology where we restored we've had
[2:44:26] the teaching right
[2:44:28] now let me just go for a moment
[2:44:31] I just got a couple of more comments
[2:44:34] in fact to the matter is
[2:44:36] we can go ahead and bring the musicians
[2:44:40] and I'll show you that I'm serious about
[2:44:43] quitting
[2:44:47] but here's where we're at
[2:44:49] I want you as a church to know and I'm
[2:44:51] going to be re-emphasizing this
[2:44:53] we've had nearly now since the prophet
[2:44:57] left let's just say since the church
[2:44:59] ages
[2:45:01] many people don't know this
[2:45:04] brother Branham never realizes that
[2:45:06] Elijah is fully realizes that Elijah is
[2:45:09] to come until he sees the last age of
[2:45:12] laodicea and says it'll be Elijah
[2:45:16] only then does he start teaching that
[2:45:18] Malachi 4 will come
[2:45:21] to restore all things
[2:45:24] and so with the beginning of the Elijah
[2:45:27] Ministry he said not in the days of the
[2:45:31] preparations in the healing revivals but
[2:45:34] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[2:45:36] angel when he starts sounding his
[2:45:38] message
[2:45:39] that's when the mysteries of God will be
[2:45:41] finished
[2:45:44] and we have had Now 60 years
[2:45:49] of teaching
[2:45:52] we've been doing what brother Branham
[2:45:53] called resting
[2:45:55] between revivals
[2:45:58] you can go ahead and start playing
[2:45:59] something that'll remind me to quit
[2:46:04] we've had nearly 60 years of teaching
[2:46:07] resting
[2:46:09] between the revivals
[2:46:13] we've been given testimonies
[2:46:15] of the great things that Jesus did in
[2:46:18] the ministry of brother Branham
[2:46:22] you know all the stories
[2:46:26] the possums the squirrels
[2:46:29] storm
[2:46:31] heady Wright
[2:46:32] you know all the stories
[2:46:36] of the blind man
[2:46:37] that is healed
[2:46:40] screaming out extra extra read all about
[2:46:43] it I'm Healed
[2:46:45] you know all the stories
[2:46:49] you we have we've been testifying
[2:46:55] for a long time now
[2:46:57] look what God did
[2:46:59] oh how great Jesus was
[2:47:02] how he moved
[2:47:05] amen come on
[2:47:07] and you know as you go along and the
[2:47:10] orders are going along
[2:47:13] it isn't long until there's a few
[2:47:14] arguments in the boat
[2:47:17] and the oars the doctrines we were to
[2:47:20] use to kind of get us to the shore you
[2:47:22] know to move along we begin to fight one
[2:47:25] another with
[2:47:28] [Music]
[2:47:34] but all the while Jesus
[2:47:38] is asleep in the boat
[2:47:42] [Music]
[2:47:46] it's time to wake Jesus
[2:47:49] I don't know if you looked out your boat
[2:47:51] window lately but there's a big storm
[2:47:54] going on
[2:47:57] laughs
[2:47:58] it's on National strife
[2:48:01] we're about to be bombed of smithereens
[2:48:04] is prophesied come on Church
[2:48:07] amen we know that trouble is on every
[2:48:09] hand look at our educational system
[2:48:12] seeds have been planted
[2:48:14] so much until kids don't even know
[2:48:17] what gender they are
[2:48:19] [Music]
[2:48:22] all of this stuff that's going on in
[2:48:25] this time and like Abraham and Sarah
[2:48:29] they received revelation of the Angel
[2:48:31] the son of man
[2:48:34] of sodom's burning and judgment
[2:48:37] Sarah's promise of restoration The
[2:48:40] Mystery of the promised Sun the mystery
[2:48:42] of lot and his salvation
[2:48:44] through the angel Messengers

[2:48:49] there is a promise
[2:48:51] and that promise is I will return to you
[2:48:54] according to the time of life
[2:48:57] that God is not abandoned his work
[2:49:01] and he has not forgot you where you are
[2:49:03] right now
[2:49:05] But Here There is a promise even like a
[2:49:07] Samson

[2:49:10] return of power
