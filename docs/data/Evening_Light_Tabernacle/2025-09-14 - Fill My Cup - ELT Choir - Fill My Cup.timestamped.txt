[0:12] I've been walking to a city I cannot
[0:16] see.
[0:18] Through the depths of the valley where
[0:20] the sun can't reach.
[0:23] [Music]
[0:24] &gt;&gt; I've been high, I've been low. I've been
[0:28] looking for the river that can fill my
[0:30] soul. Been walking to a city I cannot
[0:33] see.
[0:36] Feel my Lord.
[0:39] Run it over.
[0:42] Give me love. Give me joy. Give me
[0:45] peace.
[0:47] Fill my Lord.
[0:50] Run it over.
[0:54] I am your child in need. Oh Lord, I need
[0:59] you.
[1:00] &gt;&gt; I
[1:02] love
[1:04] it.
[1:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. I need you.
[1:11] I've been walking over lies, standing in
[1:14] my way.
[1:17] They can say what they want. I don't
[1:19] want what they say.
[1:22] [Music]
[1:23] I was born far from home, but I've been
[1:27] thriving in the wonder of the great
[1:29] unknown. Cuz I'm drinking from a well
[1:31] from another place.
[1:35] Feel my cup of
[1:37] [Music]
[1:38] it over.
[1:41] Give me love. Give me joy. Give me
[1:47] my
[1:50] run it over.
[1:53] I am your child in me. Lord, I need you.
[2:01] I have
[2:03] my Yes. Lord, I need you. I have
[2:09] [Music]
[2:12] fill my house up with hope. Fill my
[2:16] plans up with purpose. Fill my world up
[2:19] with
[2:21] [Music]
[2:22] fill my house. Fill my days up with
[2:25] meaning. Fill my dream
[2:31] and provision
[2:34] my house. Fill my house up with
[2:39] my up with
[2:42] my
[2:51] hand.
[2:57] And when I get to that city, I cannot
[3:01] see.
[3:03] I know that even this valley was a
[3:06] golden dream.
[3:09] My castle
[3:12] run it over.
[3:15] Give me love. Give me joy. Give me
[3:21] my
[3:24] run it over.
[3:27] I am your child in me. Oh Lord, I need
[3:32] you.
