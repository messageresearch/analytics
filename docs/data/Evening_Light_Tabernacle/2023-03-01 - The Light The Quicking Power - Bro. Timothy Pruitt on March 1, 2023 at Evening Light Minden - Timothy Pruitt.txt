right now just submit our spirits to you Lord and allow you to work and you to touch and you to minister and you to Lord to come on the scene for these needs we pray in Jesus name amen amen let's turn the Hebrews chapter 4. amen also you could turn to Revelations 1 and verse 16 as well amen it says for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit of the joints in Morrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart I just want to look on that word today uh this evening on quick it means alive I mean the word of God is quick also Revelations 1 and verse 16 says he and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth went sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shining in his strength and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me say it unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I'm Alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death also real quick to Romans 8 11 said but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you amen we'll let you be be seated I'd like to speak to you on the light the quickening power like the quickening power this quick because I said it means to be alive it means to be breathing it means to be among the living in other words not lifeless nor dead but it means to be active it means blessed it means to be endless in the kingdom of God it's also a living as a living water having vital power in itself and exerting the same power upon the soul it also is to be full of vigor to be fresh to be strong to be efficient to be active to be powerful to be efficacious that's what the word of God is to us tonight amen and you know every one of us we find ourselves in life as we were as seeds planted in the ground we were dead and we had to go through a Time of Dying Amen to be birthing but it would take a light that would shine upon our lives that would begin to create a certain a certain atmosphere around us to where we would come to life and that that you know a seed is has no power in it unless unless it comes to life it can never bring forth a fruit it can never bring forth a branch or a leaf it can never bring forth one little blade of grass unless that seed dies and that seed comes to life and God that's God's uh that's God's desire he he wants the Earth to be fruitful and replenished he wants amen seeds that was what he placed in the Earth was to come forth and to come out of the ground amen not to just lay their dormant or not to lay there dead or lay their lifeless but there to be a life that would come upon them and begin to pull them out of the muck and the mire that they were in into the presence of the Sun and we can see that in Ephesians 2 and verse 1 it says you hath he quick him or Made Alive who were once dead in trespasses and since we're in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh and the children of Disobedience among whom also we all all had our conversations in times past and the lust of our flesh or our manner of living is what conversation means and the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath as others but God who is rich in Mercy for with his great love wherewith he loved us I'm thankful that just shows me before we were lovable he loved us amen before we were righteous he loved us before we were amen come to our ourselves and we and we realized who we really was he loved us because of his mercy and his grace even when we were dead in sins he has quickened us together in Christ even when we were laying in that old mud pile and that old muck and that old that old Mary clay God rich in Mercy looked down over where we were laying and he placed a seed on the inside of there and he came looking for that seed he came looking for that life to come forth at a certain time he would pull Paul out in the Ephesian churches and he'd pull out others down to the Dark Ages but he came down to this last age and these last times and he's still looking for seeds to come to life he's still looking for children of God to rise up out of the myri clay and out of the sin and out of the unbelief and out of the I the Gloom as it were and Rise into the into the heavenlies amen even when we were dead in sins and his quickness or made us alive together with Christ by Grace ye are saved and has raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus he would also say in Colossians 2 and verse 13 He said you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh has he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses Hallelujah I haven't forgiven you all trespasses blotting out the handwriting of ordinance that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way and nailed it to his cross and a spoiled principalities and powers and made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it amen oh my that song this is there's no wall he won't tear down there's no lie he won't tear down amen he's going to come after his amen no matter what the devil has tried to fence them in and to cover them up with sin and unbelief that light of God is going to search his seeds out he's going to search and I believe he's still searching tonight amen I believe God is still calling the lost I believe God is still calling the lost to be Sons and Daughters of God Amen I don't believe Mercy is over because God is rich in mercy God is abundant in Mercy and he's got enough Mercy to last all the way down to the very last call amen I don't believe we got down to 2023 and God's dipping weight down and saying you know what angels I ain't got enough Mercy for that one I ain't got enough Mercy for that one no sir if there's a seed of God on the inside God's still got Mercy for that sin because God is rich in Mercy how many is grateful for that I'm thankful that God didn't come in 1975. amen because there was a seed that had to be born in 1976. I'm glad he didn't come in 1980 because that seed still had to come to life come on why did he not because there were seeds laying there why are we still here because there's still Seas laying in the ground that has to come to life amen I believe God is still calling God is still wooing and he's showing he'll spoil principalities he'll spoil Powers he'll spoil hell to go down to where one of his children are he'll break down bars he'll break down walls he'll tear down unbelief he'll he'll tear down every kind of thing the devil will ever try to do to hold one of his why because God is still rich in Mercy and he's still seeking those that are lost okay Hallelujah I just got a call this Sunday afternoon as I stepped out the building there and was speaking to uh uh brother Conroy I believe it was and and I got a call from Brother Kelly said hey I just wanted to call you said I wanted to give you a little update he said you remember even when you came he said brother Reuben came with his wife that had been diagnosed with MS and God came down and touched his heart and how how God has set it all up and and the service that took place and he came down for prayer and he said he wanted to give his heart to the Lord he said he's missed one service or one Sunday they live about two or three hours from church right now but he said he'd missed one serve one Sunday morning since then he said but he was here this Sunday and he said I want to have a moment with you brother Kelly he said I want to tell you what God's doing in my life he said you know you gave me a church AIDS book and he said that book is one of the most powerful books I ever read in my life he said it's beginning today he said I couldn't put it down I read it in a few days I'm reading it again and I'm reading it again he's but I believe God is trying to speak to me he said I want to tell you something he said when I came down to that that prayer line with my wife and and I gave my heart to God he said do you know what he said I don't know more I want to smoke I don't want to drink I don't want no more drugs I don't want nothing more that the world has ever given me I found something better I don't know what was it God rich in mercy God calling out to a sea that was laying on the inside it may have laid dormant for years been out of church for years but God don't give up God still keeps searching God still keeps turning over this Stone calling out to that one calling out to that one why he is looking for his own and he said I will not lose one of mine Hallelujah ought to give you confidence tonight God's not going to lose you he he's not going to give up on you he's not going to turn you down but God's going to be there for you calling and worrying Hallelujah and he'll spoil principalities and powers to make it happen Hallelujah he'll tear down demon horse strongholds that is held a man for 20 years been out and away from God and come on on a service and he'll orchestrate it a certain way to speak to him his heart exactly what he had cried out why because he's gone rich in Mercy Hallelujah Matthew 27 and verse 66 Sue we can read about the resurrection morning we we we know it as a as one of our cornerstones as we would say Amen it's what it's actually the thing that holds the Bible altogether because if he had came and he had died and he had went into a grave I'd have been just an ordinary man but he said I'm going to lay my life down and I got power to raise it up again it proved who he really was and we can read here in verse 62 of Matthew chapter 27 it says the next day this is following the crucifixion that followed the day of the preparation the chief priests and Pharisees came together into pilate saying sir we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days I'll rise again amen they remembered what he said but they couldn't do nothing about him Rising again hey remember what he had said listen the devil listens to the word of God he believed the devil listens he he believes and trembles he knows what the Bible said he knows that there's going to be a bride without spot without wrinkle I remember what his word said but there ain't nothing he can do about it there's going to be a bride without spot without wrinkle he remembers there's going to be a resurrection in this last day but there ain't nothing he can do about it he can plan all he wants to to try to stop it but it'll not stop it [Applause] um amen sir we remember that that deceiver said well if he was really a deceiver why are they worried about what he said command therefore that the Sepulcher be made sure unto the third day unless his disciples come by night and steal him away and say unto the people he has risen from the dead so the last Heir shall be worse than the first pilate said unto them you have a watch go your way make it as sure as you can the devil try to make as sure as he could to keep you from coming to life he tried to make it as sure as he could to keep you sealed in his tomb and sealed in your unbelief and sealed in your doubt he tried to do everything go make it as sure as you can but if there's a seed in there it's going to come out amen so they went and they made disciplical sure sealing the stone and setting a watch amen the devil was sure he was going to hold some of y'all in drugs he was sure he was going to hold you in pornography he was sure he was going to trap you one way or another he was sure that you was going to be down and defeated a long time ago he was sure you would have done gave up by now he was sure you would have said this message name for me I might as well walk away he was sure he would pour it on you and pour it on you and pour it on you and to destroy your finances and destroy your family and destroy everything he was sure by now you would give up but he doesn't realize the quickening power that can come to a seed [Applause] Amen in the end of the Sabbath as it began to Dawn toward the first day of the week Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the Sepulcher and behold that was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the Stone from the door and sat upon it to me I love that right there because he took the stone that sealed him in there they had taken the Roman seal and they'd put it all around there to make sure there was no disciple could sneak up during the night and tear it apart and put a guard around it and everything else but here comes this light and it comes down and it blinds them and it put and there's such a power that comes forth that it breaks the seals off the stone and then he rolls that stone over they see something you think's a great big hindrance is nothing to God Amen he can try to put a great big Stone over your life he can try to seal you in he can try to keep you in he can try to Bow you he can try to do whatever he wants to but when that light begins to come down and begins to pull upon your life it'll break seals it'll pull stones out of the way it'll do whatever it has to and then it'll roll that big old problem over and it'll sit down on it [Applause] what you thought was impossible is nothing but a place for God to sit upon what you thought was impossible is a place God can show you I've got Authority I've got power and I got ability come on somebody we're gonna have church tonight amen because I know amen the devil's been telling you what you're dealing with is impossible what you're dealing with ain't no way there ain't no hell there's nothing can be done about it but the light is coming down and it's pulling a seed out and it's pulling the power of God out and it's breaking sealed and Rolling Stones away come on somebody and all of a sudden he rolled back the stone and sat on it and his countenance was like lightning has a bright light and as Raymond white as snow and for fear of him the keepers the ones that was going to make sure that this wasn't going to happen the one do you see how God did it he said y'all just go make sure but in y'all's making sure it's going to prove who I am hello somebody and you're making sure that the stone is going to stay there and that that the body is going to stay there it's actually going to really truly prove who I am and somebody said this well here a while back it was a powerful thought listen God didn't move the stone away for himself he could walk through walls that body of Jesus could have stood up and walked right through that stone wall right to the outside he didn't need the stone to move away for him to pull come out but he moved the stone for you he moved the stone so you would know amen the power of God came down and it broke the Seal of the Romans and if and it caused the keepers who were going to make sure Mercy Jesus amen those drugs that we're going to make sure that alcohol that was going to make sure that tobacco that was going to make sure that that adultery there was going to make sure whatever it was that the devil had positioned upon your life was going to make sure it actually and and his defeat prove that God has done something for you and the fear of him the keepers did Shake and became as dead men and the angel answered and said unto the women fear not you for I know that you seek Jesus which was crucified he's not here for he has risen did you follow the context of all of that the lightning came down white as Raymond wool sitting on the breaks the seal breaks the stone sits upon it and then he said he's not here his body was already gone he was showing without any doubt without any kind of thing that they could come up with listen the keepers had to say hey something's happened they had to testify amen something they saw amen they came as dead men he made them stand still so they couldn't do nothing about it they couldn't stop the Stone from Rolling away they couldn't keep the seals on there they couldn't put it back if they wanted to put they became his dead man he made them stand still and see the glory of God Hallelujah that's exactly what happened on your Resurrection Day When God came over your life and lightning came down like as as it were from heaven and it struck something on the inside of you the enemy that was holding you and he was holding and he was holding and light fell down and it broke them and they became as dead men what was it they became powerless no more could they hold you no more could they keep you no more could they put you back Hallelujah they didn't get him out and they couldn't put him back come on somebody that devil didn't get you out of where you was God brought you out and if God brought you out the devil won't put you back in he cannot do what God has already done for you quickening power the word of God was spoken many many hundreds of years before his coming of his crucifixion of his death of her suffering but it also spoke of his resurrection all the things that Jesus did and all the all of his Vindication of God's word and what he did for to fulfill it Healing The Sick raising the dead casting out Devils preaching the gospel to the poor fulfilling every word that God said that he would do when he came and then also suffering for our sins and our stead to be the perpetuation for our sin at the cross where no one else could have done it for him but above all of that I think the Resurrection on Easter morning it sealed the whole thing because they've been prophets on the earth before and they had prophesied before they had healed the sick before they had raised the dead before they had done the same signs Jesus was doing but the resurrection proved who he was it proved that the quickening power was there and it sealed the word of God forever for the believer all Gloom and all doubt was shattered on this Blissful morning more hallelujah oh think about it I want you to kind of key on that word Gloom right there because we're going to get somewhere on that man had been shut up as it was in a prison house amen but what happened God came down and he became flesh and and he moved among them and he did signs and wonders and all that's wonderful but he and he died for their sin and he said it's finished and all that's great but it wouldn't have been for that Resurrection morning it had been just as any other man his dying would have been in vain because it would not have done anything for us it was that resurrecting power that sealed it all amen it sealed the word of God forever it settled it when that one came and said I have power to lay my life down and I have power to take it up again and then go prove what he said he would do God purpose to prove his word the truth there's only one man that could do that and that was Jesus and he came and he proved it to be the truth it sealed it that broke the seals of glue it scattered all Superstition where great men had raised up and said great things and done marvelous things but still in the grave today but our Christian religion is the one that has an empty tomb not just a dead man and a grave and died for something for a good cause no but he raised again and he's still living among those it's the quickening power and that's what sets you apart from other religions you can raise the Dead you can do all kinds of things but if that quick and Empower ain't on the inside of you you're just as any other person any other religion come on now our Christian religion is the only one that has an empty tomb it proves to me that he's the god of the dead and he's the god of the living that he could raise up the dead and bring back to life in this quick and Empower is quickening Spirit has proved through the years that he's the one who can Quicken the dead back to life again oh my that's what's going to separate a bunch of people one day is the quickening power of the Holy Ghost amen not only to change their lives but also change their bodies come on now that is what's going to separate one religion from all other religions one belief from all other beliefs is the change of the body that's when he proved he had the pro he was by his promise that great quickening power conquering power he had on Resurrection mourning he proved there he can conquer death hell and the grave and then he said there in Revelation we read I am he that is dead but is alive again come on now and what what good is a dead God what good is a dead man somewhere in the Tomb Muhammad they got a dead man Buddha's got a dead man all these other major religions got dead men amen but we don't have just a dead man somewhere one day he's going to rise and one day he's going to do this and one day is going to come back no sir he is here Among Us he has risen from the dead and it proves to us that he has the keys to death hell and the grave therefore if I go by the way of the Grave he has the power to go across my ashes and raise me up again LeBron will say it like this and I was getting to that point I was making God hasten the day that when we as Christians who believe this Bible can prove what we're talking about when we can prove by our lives and by the Bible that our lives are vindicating that word to be living today that's the day we're looking for God living today not even living 50 60 years ago God living today amen as he said in Romans 8 if the spirit that raised up Jesus Christ being you it'll also Quicken your mortal bodies not only did he prove to him to but he also proved to us that he was Jehovah Redeemer and had power over death hell in the grave but he also gave us the access to the Same Spirit to the same quickening power to the same life The Same Spirit that raised that body up from the grave is the same spirit that quickens you tonight for the spirit of the raised in Jesus from the grave dwells in your body it would also Quicken it or make it alive after death people want the quick and Empower but they don't want the death he can never get to the quickening power unless he went through the death and you will never get to the Holy Ghost the spirit of God unless you're willing to die unless you can come to that part and go Gethsemane it says Lord not my will but thy will be done not what I desire what I think is right but what you think is right not what I want but what you want not what I I'm I'm looking forward what you're looking for in Me God that's what I want oh but we want the power but what about the death I mean it's common sense if you go if you're going to be raised up in the resurrection you're going to have to die right you want to go by the way of the grave same in this in this life if you don't die now you won't raise then amen but see this world has been shut up in doubt but it was proven at that moment not only talked about but proven that Jesus said then and as Jesus said go therefore teach All Nations prove to them how you prove to them well I tell you what I got I got a bunch of degrees on my wall the message and I can tell you and I can bring it up and down one side of the other that ain't what he said by demonstration by demonstrating the power of God to them these signs shall follow them that believe them will promise and say they believe he give a definite understanding of that that these signs would follow them that believed it would be the proof of their testimony signs or wonders are proof that you truly believe well we don't need signs of wondering then you don't believe amen this ain't some crazy uh algebra here it's one plus one equals two well you know we we need greater things we'll start believing first amen it'd be proof of their testimony but until we have the proven sign that he said that would be upon us then we're just confessing to be Believers and not the possession of believers direct quote if you if you don't have that in your midst or in your body working among you then you're just confessing you believe it's one of the most fought after things brother Wayne just sent a quote on that I'm trying to remember it right off it's Mark 16. Go in all the world and preach the gospel preach demonstrate show people a living God well I ain't a preacher well you can do it at your work show them somebody that's died and rose again show them somebody that once was a life of of sin and Disobedience and fulfilling the lust of the flesh but now that old man's dead he don't live no more he don't do the things that you see he might have used to pull some dirty deals and cheap people out of money but that ain't what he does no more he died but now there's somebody else's rose again these signs shall follow them in all the world and every creature these signs shall follow them in my name they shall cast out Devils what do we do to Reuben we cast out devils it was demons there in his life of smoking and demons of of of drinking and demons of doping Demons of unbelief truly that's what happened the demon of unbelief got he got delivered from it for a long time he didn't believe he could be saved for a long time he didn't believe it was for him him and his family walked out years before but all of a sudden he had a need and he said if I can just get to Jesus and Touch the Hem of His Garment then we can be I can find healing for my wife something began to stir or something that caused him to believe and it comes that service and God anoints a man to go right down his life and call out the very thing that was going on bring him right to the same spot and I believe broke off of him he said God doesn't Hear My Cry God does know what I'm going through God does see who I have he's heard me come down that's next night and he said I want to serve a God who has Mercy like that that can come down to my Pew and Hear My Cry and then call out my knee I want to serve that God and we laid hands on him as the Bible said and we cast it off and God delivered the boy he's still in the delivering business that was his last commission to church they shall they shall cast out Devils speak with new tongues um yeah if they taken up deadly things serpents drinking a deadly thing it'll not harm them now I personally look at this this way if you happen to find something deadly I believe God can Overlook that and have mercy on it but I look at the things that we have to do today we have to tell we had to take a vaccine to travel you know what I only reason why I was wanting I would do it was to go to minister the gospel and I said Lord these signs shall follow them that believe if this thing is deadly it will not harm me medicines you have to take sometimes for certain situations Cancer all kinds of things that you got to do amen you can take it but I believe God can anoint that medicine to go to where the issue is amen and it not harm you but harm the sickness amen and they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover they shall recover as his last commission to the church and it's still in effect doesn't matter what some preacher said it's still an effect doesn't matter what critics say it's still an effect it's the quickening power that was handed to the church Paul ordaining it years later in the church Galatians 1 said of angel from heaven preaches to you any other gospel than this which is already received let him be accursed foreign next sentence I believe this is 65. it's just in case you need to know hashtag notice the date next sentence I believe that Pentecost began without an I believe it's to be to every creature at all times at all plays that the Pentecost that Pentecost should always remain the Pentecostal blessing should always be upon the people Hallelujah and now what is this Pentecostal blessing it is the confirmation of the Resurrection so let Pentecost be a dirty word to you if you want to but as for me and my house I believe it ought to go to every mother every father ever son ever daughter every Church it is a confirmation of the Resurrection no wonder the gospel itself means good news good news good news of one he's raised from the dead well I've got cancer well I got good news he's raged from the dead come on somebody I got a son or a daughter out there lost I've got good news he is raised from the dead [Applause] I don't know what are you saying that for because death was the most evil thing and the greatest power that was held against man and God himself came down in human flesh and he put it under his foot and I'm reminded I'm reminded as brother Brandon would pray for that Maniac they're in Portland Oregon and he would cast that devil out and they would ask was he delivered he'd say no he worships that demon but he would say well you roll them off my feet and he would go up and he says as I was saying faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not sin and about that time somebody popped up out of a wheelchair and another one jumped off the car and another one ran screaming he said when about five minutes time every person in the building was delivered he said why he said cause that chief of that tribe of demons had made a challenge but he lost Lord of God but he lost death you lost you lost and when that Chief lost everyone under him fell also Hallelujah there's resurrection power that's among us tonight death you lost therefore cancer you lose lower the sugar diabetes you lose high blood pressure you lose sad you lose he's raised from the dead and because I live ye shall live also oh Jesus ye were who wants dead and sinned and trespasses God has quickened Us Together by the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead we are now sitting in Heavenly places oh what a joy to tell people that story that believes it's the truth do you believe it to be the truth tonight foreign he said but I'm wondering what's really happening this is a very nice quote he said are we getting people to guard are we getting them to a church we must get them to Christ this quickening power oh it's good to go to church and sets as far as you go that's not far enough he said when you come to church that's good but go on to Christ because he must receive you must receive this quick and Empower if we're ever expected to be in that General Resurrection because it's the only one that ever bring us from the dead for if this spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelling you it also Quicken you and bring your life bring life to your mortal bodies what a promise the very essence of their Resurrection is to tell and show and prove Jesus has raised from the dead he's not dead he's living and he lives here and he lives with us and I'll be with you even in you till the end of the world [Applause] as Christians we all claim he's alive well we've been quickened from life from Death To Life by Spirit but if we haven't been quickened then we haven't been made alive notice it's the same spirit that raised him up from the dead that raised him up from the grave that is dwelling in US how could that be the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead is dwelling in us now it's the spirit that quickens it's the spirit as quick and it's not the word that quickens it's the spirit that quickens hello well we got the word we got the word we have to have the spirit too or the word is just dead it's the spirit that quickens the word or gives the word life it gives it wings to fly why does it need wings to fly because it needs to fly over there to where that Devil's sitting on your property and bomb him come on now you can say it all you want to you can say it you can say it you can say it and you say but if the spirit ain't in that word it don't have wings to fly it don't have it gonna fall hit the ground but if there's spirit that comes with that word it's going to fly and listen God had a home and device way before man ever ever invented one he knows exactly where to go to somebody and to something he knows exactly where that Devil's been camping out on your little spot and he's been camping down and he's clamped down on your joy or he's clamped down on your happiness and your peace he's clamped down on on the things of life in your heart and you wonder what amen but if you can just ever get into the spirit of God and let it begin to move on the inside of you amen a little later I've mentioned it last last week but Lord will we'll get there amen this sword is a two-mile sword it's got to be spoke from the word of God from God's lips and then it's got to go on the believer's lips come on now it's got to be you speaking it but not just speaking a letter or speaking something laying there on paper but something become inspired to you and the spirit quickened and say hey that's what I'm going through that's what's happening right now I want to speak it in the name of Jesus and you watch it Wings will come out of there and then start honing in on that devil and then start bombing him and bombing him and vomiting until he's obliterated out of your life [Music] it's the spirit that does that second Corinthians 3 6 says who also hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit given life so it's not just receiving a letter got to receive the spirit otherwise it's just dead Creeds and dullness ideas it's been passed on by traditions of men down through ages and you're just taking it all in no no we we need more than that we need the spirit of God you see a wheat seed is just a wheat seed until the life gets quickened that's on the inside of it then it brings forth other life amen which we were when we were once Dead made in the image of God yet dead dead and sins and trespasses there was some way God had to get this quickening life into our mortal bodies I'm talking about your body now as a promised Messiah he quickened every word that was prophesied that he would do he healed the sick he how he would be born of a virgin it was true he was the word manifested here on Earth but he could not do just that as a as man it took the spirit of God dwelling on the inside of him to Quicken these promises to him he said I hope that we get this real clear Jesus being a man himself the body but it took the spirit in him it's not me that doeth the work but my father that dwelleth in me he's the one that does the work Jesus himself was the word because he was but he was predestinated by the foreknowledge of God how God's plan was to be he was sent a redeemer and this Redeemer only could be his own son and then God's promise all the way from the Garden of Eden that Jesus would be here and he was a man born of a virgin but it took the spirit of God to Quicken the word to him so if it's going to take the spirit to Quicken it to Jesus it's going to take the spirit to Quicken it to you that's why we got to make sure that we don't do anything to hinder the spirit when he moves yes he said he was the word quickened for that hour the time had come when you would have to have a redeemer the law had failed all things other things had failed it takes a redeemer he was quickened to that by the spirit and he said that that same spirit that was upon him to be the Redeemer in that age that we have accepted now the promises of this last day what would take place and you become a part of that word and you're redeemed with him because the same spirit that dwelt in him is now dwelling in you and is quick and in your life to this age it would be nice if some of your lives will get quick into a service but he said he gone quicker to this age Quicken your mortal bodies resurrect you bring them up again and that takes away the Gloom that we're looking at oh God oh my yes brother Timothy the Gloom did you not see what's going on in the world and all the things that are happening what is Gloom Gloom is partial or total darkness it's a dark shadowy place it's a loness of spirit is a dejection an atmosphere of despondency let me read a few on Gloom I kind of just broke into this study right at the last so may the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ move down what he said the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ moved down and settle down and come over this audience and all the glooms of fear and doubt and unbelief be moved all away just a touch of your presence and they will receive it just move the Gloom back enough that our spiritual eyes can be opened to see what's standing in the building tonight Amen to where we can see you and your presence is omnipotent oh Hallelujah and when omnipotence speaks Miracles take place [Applause] hallelujah amen I say God may may be all the Gloom that we've seen around us and the world and things that are going on we're going to get there why what that gloom's there for amen it's there for a purpose amen but let it be just pushed back in the service tonight and all of a sudden we don't see our son that's been sitting out there away from God we see him right here at altar we don't see our body all wore down by sickness and some disease maybe cancer sugar diabetes or something but all of a sudden we see our body well and we begin to walk into it and we begin to move that direction why because it's something quickened to us but all the glooms got to be driven back that's why brother Tim said the other day you've got to fight the Devil comes in every service to try to put down doubt and fear and unbelief and try to say whether this is just a Wednesday night no need to get it to get all worked up or get excited to get enthused about nothing it's work tomorrow and you got bills to pay and you got this to do and you got that to do and you got this going on you got next week and you got next month of what we're going to do next year 10 years around the road where are you going to be settling down with Gloom but if we can let the spirit of God begin to move as it would move over the Earth that we stand at home as they're set in a dark place and it was all in a dark a messed up condition and God said let there be light and the spirit will move down with that word and to begin to woo and they begin to move this direction and woo it'll move over here and it woo then the preacher would go down this road and it would woo and it would come back over here and he would woo what's he trying to do get seeds to come out of the dark get seeds to come out of the light out of the darkness into the light get seeds to rise up above the muck of the world and all the things the devil tries to put if we could just get that enough we could see there's angels of Fire they've come into this place like lightning and they've come into our midst and they said hey that seal that's held you is not going to hold you no more that thing that's kept you in it's not going to hold you there no more that Pride that arrogance that's the that's not going to hold you no more amen but I have an answer come on now oh my I said tonight maybe a cancer has conquered you maybe something else is taking you some disease of sin or whatever it may look dark and gloomy to you now it may look like you'll never recover it may look like you can't get over that prostate trouble or that lung trouble or that TB or that tumor or that condition the doctor May say ever hope is gone but standing right by your side tonight ready to take you in possession stands eyes of Faith who sees a victory Yonder through the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah Hallelujah away with Satan and his glue away with Satan in his glue and up with the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ come on now tune in just for a moment two inches away with Satan in his glue and up with the faith of the Lord faith that can take his stand on the Rock of Ages and Pierce an Eagle Eye whoever's stormy cloud and every wave of death and disappointment and it'll stand there and it'll look right straight and say God Is Right [Music] come on now God Is Right laughs so why are you preaching so hard brother Timothy because I feel the Gloom that's here tonight feel it pressing trying to keep you down trying to keep you in a in a just a a mood well I tell you what it's Wednesday night and I work late I'm tired the more I got to get up and go to work again trying to keep you in a Gloom is trying to keep you from missing your opportunity for the sky to break out wow man look all around me what's happening Angels begin to sing I'll never forget preaching there in Belgium I remember the Isaiah vomber brown as he said here just a few months ago on that Pew right there second row with his wife he was in a lot of Gloom just a few months before his dad had been taken away off the scene the Lord had taken him on the other side and a wonderful Christian man lovely man lovely spirit just sitting there and on the stairwell and just went over gone and Isaiah was out there in the world and his his daddy's one desire to see Isaiah serve God and here Isaiah finds himself on a Friday night at a at a youth meeting of all things and he comes there with his wife and his family and as a preacher all the way from Louisiana who just happens to be preaching on born of the fire and how they say you have to be born in the presence of God Amen you've wanted it all your life but there is a presence that can come upon you that'll change you from a old worthless person and worthless hypocrite into a son or daughter of God and I talked about those redwoods or Sequoia is out there in California how did they drop seeds down to the ground and then it's proven that it takes fire for those seeds to come to life if they don't get that atmosphere that burning of fire they never come and become Mighty trees I said but here tonight some seeds and God's wanting to turn them into mighty trees God's going to want to raise them up and show I am the god over Europe I am the god over European ideas European influence I am the same yesterday today and forever this man finds himself down an altar me and Brother David Mayer begin to pray for him the music wasn't hardly playing I don't believe anybody was even singing and he raises his hands up all at once and begins to scream to the top of his lungs what was he doing he seen past the Gloom [Applause] he's seen past the despondency he's seen past all the doubt and unbelief and he's saying hey God you're not just my daddy's God you're my God too and they began to hear from the most beautiful singing he ever heard in his life and I told Brother Isaiah I said I'll tell you who it was there's rejoicing in the presence of angels God allowed your daddy to look over the banister and say look here son there's your son come to the god tonight here he is amen what was it he got a glimpse beyond the Gloom what do you think Ron Spencer's lasted as long as he's lasted he's gave me permission for this tonight I'll text him a few things and he said he said I remember when I was under a lot of Gloom and so I got diagnosed with cancer and he said fear said over me and Gloom never see my grandkids rugger never see this no more thanksgivings no more things he loves and enjoyed he said I was going down he said God sent two men one from Louisiana and one from Tennessee and came and knocked on his door said we come to cast that spirit of fear out and tongues fell in the room and what was it God pushed back the darkness ain't got a glimpse of another round that God said if you would trust me I'll use you like never before but what happened the Gloom was broke off of his life that's what God is trying to do in this service right now there's Gloom on you and you're trying to hold it down and the devil's pushing and pushing and pushing but if you'll just throw those hands up and start praising the Lord and get a catch on rest on a glimpse of another dementia you realize God is my provider he's my savior he's all I ever had need of away was Satan in his glare away with Satan in his glue I say taste and see taste and see give God a chance see if he'll take and he'll give you glory for your misery he'll give you happiness for your Gloom he'll give you health for your sickness he'll give you the Holy Ghost for your theology taste and see that the Lord is good let's give him a chance on the Wednesday night let's give him a chance and Jason [Applause] that the Lord is good oh he's full of Mercy he's full of grace he's not going to run out but he's got enough for me he's funneled healing he's full of power taste and see get another drink tonight [Applause] see if he won't break that Gloom off your life and those Spirits are trying to hold you down hello oh you can stand you stay on your feet Hallelujah he said it's an awful thing a shadow of Darkness always makes you so upset and you know everybody said keep saying oh get next to yourself he said how can you do something when something's holding you like that don't you believe that sister don't you know that to be the truth oh Father here's some Mother's darling baby perhaps some man's wife some child's mother and she stands here with a lot of glue Satan is making her nervous he would have had her commit suicide hit a sinner to an insane asylum cause her to sit in the Patty sail against the wall but she came forward to confess her love to you whoo Hallelujah and may the Holy Spirit now move down and drive this enemy away and then leave her and never return again and she'd be happy all the rest of her life and free from disease of this disease and affliction in Jesus name [Applause] has it left your sister that's right you feel it's gone now now you can raise your head Hallelujah now you can raise your hand now you can go off the platform happy and rejoicing and praising God come on now the devil said Ronald you're never going to get to yourself you're never going to get Victory you're never going to have joy I'm going to take you down to an early grave I'm going to cause you to give your life take your life but there's a spirit that's moved in this building and it's moving down and it's touching hearts and it's touching life it's ah that ain't for you you're my child you're my son you're my daughter you're mine I'll never forget as I was in Poland one time preaching through a a woman interpreter they didn't have nobody else she was a teacher of English and she was translating the message and God had dealt me with me has a longer store but just a short of it on the on the preacher thought and let my people go and I began to speak about some of these very things of gloom and doubts and unbeliefs and I said some he wants to take all the way down to suicide and he wants to take their life and take them to a early grave and I'm preaching long then I've realized I lost her she ain't she's not translating to look at her tears just coming she's got her head and her hands and her head her head in her hands she's crying and she said give me a minute brother Timothy and she starts mumbling the words and trying to keep back up and I'll just lay my hand over and begin to pray for her and as God began to move in that building she would later testify to me in a car on her way to the pastor's house with a pastor and his wife and she's translating she would tell me in English she said brother Timothy just this very weak I try to take my life I try to end it all I said ain't nothing I got to give for God I said but now it's heard the words tonight that I have been set free and I want you to know brother too and then you came so this Gloom could be broke off my life oh hallelujah hallelujah that's why I'm here tonight I'm here to break blue off of your life Hallelujah the devil's been trying to put it on me I said you devil you're going to pay for it you're going to pay for it you try to put Gloom on me and push me down I'm gonna preach harder I'm gonna go harder and I'm going to tell them hey sister you don't have to be bound by that no more you can now raise your head little blind you can raise your hand you ain't got nothing to be ashamed of cause prayer is he that's in you that he that's in the world you can start to Rejoice right now and you can go home rejoicing [Applause] Hallelujah he was saying another place and I I don't know where it's at he said why is all this Gloom around why is it around he said it's a sign of the coming of the Lord listen let me just bring it down to an individual sense and then we'll go to a global sense individually when you feel on a Wednesday or Sunday morning that the devil's pushing on you that's a sure sign God's got something for you [Applause] when you feel him trying to get everything out of order and how to cater you need to just stop for a minute so wait a minute God's fixing to do something God's fixing to move God's fixing to touch me God's fixing to minister in a very powerful way and then you need to stop not just stop but turn your thoughts say God I'm going to look away from that and I'm going to praise the mighty name I'm gonna Lift You Lord I'm gonna praise you when you feel this world getting more and more gloomy politics are gloomy world wars and rumors of War
