[21:18] just one moment
[21:20] as we get started here I pray that
[21:23] you'll just be patient with me tonight
[21:25] as um
[21:28] I do this
[21:29] I've never done anything quite like this
[21:32] as far as taking and trying to put
[21:35] visuals and things up there just for the
[21:37] uh for the sake of y'all being able to
[21:39] follow along and
[21:41] um
[21:42] yeah
[21:43] um how many and this ain't gonna call
[21:45] anybody out but how many by the raising
[21:47] of hand can say I read chapter one in
[21:49] the church age book
[21:51] okay that's a lot of hands so I'm not
[21:53] going to look at the ones that didn't if
[21:54] you didn't
[21:56] please catch up because uh my heart's
[21:58] desire as we go through these services
[22:00] at the end of it is that you have read
[22:03] the church age book for yourself that is
[22:06] my heart's desire because because I know
[22:08] that there are so many things in that
[22:11] book that that we believe and it's not
[22:14] that we just believe them because
[22:15] brother Brown was a prophet although
[22:17] that's the truth but it's things that
[22:19] are in the Bible and maybe you've been
[22:22] told your whole life we believe this we
[22:24] believe this we believe this and what
[22:25] the church age book can help do for you
[22:27] is place that in the word and help you
[22:30] have an understanding of oh it's not
[22:32] just because mama said or it's not just
[22:34] because daddy said or or just because
[22:36] this is what we believe but it is in the
[22:39] Bible it is the word of God and and
[22:41] that's that's our desire is that you
[22:43] would read the church age book and
[22:46] hopefully by coming to the meetings and
[22:47] we can have the opportunity to maybe
[22:49] break it down just a little bit what we
[22:51] have read and and and maybe bring it
[22:54] kind of like a Sunday school lesson but
[22:56] we also just want to ask the Lord that
[22:58] he would come in an anoint to where it
[23:00] wouldn't necessarily just be something
[23:01] dry of me teaching or going over slides
[23:05] but that you can be be touched in his
[23:07] presence that that is our desire as we
[23:10] go through this our our main theme
[23:12] really is just is a study of the seven
[23:16] Church ages just like brother Brown said
[23:18] but but in this we're going to discuss a
[23:20] lot of major doctrines that we believe
[23:22] from the Bible and like I said I Believe
[23:25] by the grace of God it will help each
[23:27] and every one of us grow in our faith to
[23:30] see the things that we believe lying
[23:32] right there in the word and um your
[23:36] brother Branham says that that the the
[23:38] church Ages come forth with a mighty
[23:41] initial illumination without which there
[23:44] could be no further light he says for
[23:47] out of the ages comes the seals and out
[23:49] of the seals come the trumpets and out
[23:51] of the trumpets come the vowels like the
[23:54] first burst of a Roman Candle the church
[23:55] ate just come forth with a mighty
[23:57] initial illumination without which there
[24:01] could be no further light so so if he he
[24:06] makes a statement of that much
[24:08] importance about an understanding of the
[24:10] ages I believe it's something that we
[24:12] should take heed to if he says that
[24:13] there can be no further light without
[24:16] this then it's something that we should
[24:17] look into and do our best to have an
[24:20] understanding and one thing that we're
[24:21] going to find as we go into this is that
[24:23] it can't just be our best and what we
[24:26] think brother Branham makes it clear
[24:28] that you know even just regular study
[24:31] won't reveal these things to you but it
[24:33] takes a revelation so so my prayer for
[24:37] each of us is that as we go through this
[24:39] that we will all have greater Revelation
[24:42] than when we began he says but once the
[24:45] Brilliance of the seven Church ages is
[24:47] given by divine revelation light upon
[24:50] light follows until the whole of the
[24:53] Revelation opens wide before our
[24:57] wandering eyes
[25:00] so as we go into this I believe that we
[25:01] should all strive to understand all the
[25:04] truths of God many times as young people
[25:06] some of those things seem Out Of Reach
[25:08] you know some of those things brother
[25:10] Tim has talked to me and he says you
[25:11] know he says I I I'm concerned because I
[25:15] don't want to preach things that are
[25:16] just flying right over the heads of the
[25:18] young people you know and he says
[25:19] sometimes I I say things and I see the
[25:22] young people just like
[25:24] you know and he says and so his desire
[25:28] our desire is that we should strive for
[25:31] all of it and if there's things that we
[25:32] can't quite grasp that we we don't just
[25:35] lay it aside and forget about it but we
[25:37] pray that the Lord will open our eyes to
[25:39] those things and help us have an
[25:41] understanding of those things and and it
[25:43] is my desire that his brother Branham
[25:45] says here as we go through this that
[25:47] light upon light will be shed into our
[25:50] lives as we study the church ages
[25:54] so we had you to read chapter one which
[25:56] was entitled The revelation of Jesus the
[26:00] Christ and and if you have your Bibles
[26:03] with you we're gonna
[26:06] turn to Revelation 1 1 through 3. I feel
[26:10] kind of like brother uh Matt Watkins who
[26:13] showed up last week and came to preach
[26:15] for us and didn't bring his Bible and so
[26:17] he had the bar brother Tim's and then I
[26:19] walked out here and set my computer down
[26:21] and went I didn't bring my Bible
[26:24] but I've got the verses right here we're
[26:26] going to read Revelation 1 1-3 if you'll
[26:28] stand with me as we read
[26:31] these three verses
[26:35] says the revelation of Jesus
[26:38] of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him
[26:40] to show unto his servants things which
[26:43] must shortly come to pass and he sent
[26:46] and signified it by his Angel unto his
[26:48] servant John who bear record of the word
[26:52] of God and of the testimony of Jesus
[26:54] Christ and of all things that he saw
[26:57] blessed is he that readeth you've
[27:01] already been blessed tonight
[27:02] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[27:05] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[27:08] those things which are written therein
[27:10] for the time is at hand amen you may
[27:14] have your seats
[27:15] for the time
[27:17] is at hand I believe this is something
[27:19] that we should take very seriously as we
[27:21] look around the world around us and
[27:23] recognize young people the time is at
[27:25] hand the things that that I've heard
[27:27] preach my whole life the things that
[27:29] you've heard preach it's not something
[27:31] that's that's a long way off even if if
[27:33] you follow any news whatsoever and I
[27:36] know as a young person many times we
[27:37] don't because news is for old people or
[27:39] whatever but but even as in the news
[27:41] daily now I'm seeing headlines about
[27:44] World War III I in the last two weeks
[27:47] every single day I'm seeing headlines is
[27:49] this the start of World War III are we
[27:51] being led right into World War III just
[27:53] time after time and I don't say those
[27:55] things to scare you as I've said before
[27:56] as Believers we shouldn't get scared
[27:58] when the things that we've believed for
[28:00] our whole life start to appear in front
[28:01] of us it shouldn't Shake us but it
[28:03] shouldn't be something in us that makes
[28:05] us want to dig a little deeper and and
[28:07] make our calling in election sure and
[28:09] say Lord thank you that you allow me to
[28:11] see these signs thank you that you allow
[28:13] me to recognize it and that it doesn't
[28:15] shake me in the way of fear but it lets
[28:17] me know it's time to look up because our
[28:19] Redemption draweth nigh
[28:23] amen so we read Revelation one through
[28:25] three and that's where this begins and
[28:28] and brother Branham tells us that the
[28:30] Scribe of this book is Saint John the
[28:34] Divine
[28:35] and he says he's not the author but he
[28:37] is the Scribe it is the only book in the
[28:41] entire Bible that is written by Jesus
[28:43] himself through personally appearing to
[28:47] a scribe and and we know that this book
[28:50] is written while John is exiled out on
[28:52] the Isle of Patmos and it is a Greek
[28:55] island where many Christians were were
[28:57] sent for their stand and their stand for
[29:01] for Christianity and for Jesus and I
[29:03] want to tell you today you know many
[29:05] times that we we feel like we have a lot
[29:07] of persecution or what do our friends
[29:09] say and how will people look at us in
[29:12] Walmart if we're holding the standard of
[29:14] Christianity and I'm telling you that we
[29:17] actually have a light burden to bear can
[29:19] compared to what they buried in days
[29:21] gone by because I can guarantee you no
[29:24] matter how many people may Snicker and
[29:25] laugh at you as you walk through Target
[29:28] they're not going to take you and put
[29:30] you in a den of lines okay you're not
[29:32] going to have to pick up swords and and
[29:34] be gladiators by the end of the week
[29:36] you've got it okay okay so we want to be
[29:39] thankful that what happened to John is
[29:40] because of his stand he was put out on
[29:43] the on the Isle of patents by the Roman
[29:45] Emperor domitian is how I pronounce it
[29:48] that's probably wrong I don't speak
[29:49] Latin but but the it says
[29:53] d-o-m-i-t-i-a-n it may be domidian I'm
[29:56] not sure but either way he's placed
[29:58] there and many times what we have to
[30:00] recognize is in in things that we that
[30:03] the devil means for evil God is going to
[30:06] turn and use that situation in your life
[30:08] for good out of this Exile out of being
[30:11] placed out there with the Scorpions and
[30:13] spiders on this Rocky Little Island
[30:15] which is one of the worst things that
[30:16] could have happened to him it probably
[30:18] was intended to bring his death about
[30:20] out of that comes the Book of Revelation
[30:23] an opportunity for God to draw close and
[30:26] to appear to him and speak to him when
[30:28] the devil does things to you don't let
[30:30] that be an opportunity for him to keep
[30:32] you away from God don't let that be an
[30:34] opportunity for him to get you
[30:35] completely separated but when he does
[30:37] his worse to you always recognize it
[30:40] that is an opportunity for you to draw
[30:42] closer to God than ever before it is an
[30:45] opportunity for you to lean into the
[30:47] bosom of God and to draw strength like
[30:49] you never have before it's actually
[30:52] quite typical of humans when things are
[30:54] good not to lean on God when things are
[30:57] good to lean on their own understanding
[30:59] or to lean On Their Blessings as it were
[31:01] And yet when the Devil comes and
[31:03] tightens the screws down many times
[31:05] times that's when we can draw closer to
[31:07] God than ever before and I pray that we
[31:09] don't always just wait till it's the
[31:11] hard times don't just wait till you're
[31:13] on the Isle of patents but tonight take
[31:15] the opportunity and say Lord I want to
[31:16] draw closer to you tonight than I ever
[31:19] have before brother Brown would describe
[31:23] um would describe the Book of Revelation
[31:25] using this same analogy because the
[31:27] Greek word for Revelation is apocalypse
[31:31] which means the unveiling and he would
[31:33] say it's like a sculptor who has a
[31:36] sculpture hidden under a blanket and
[31:38] then he removes it to show it to his
[31:41] audience this is the unveiling The Book
[31:45] of Revelation is the unveiling or the
[31:48] revelation of Jesus Christ
[31:53] how many tonight would like him to be
[31:55] unveiled before your eyes say Lord I've
[31:57] seen bits and pieces I've seen a little
[31:59] bit I I've understood some Lord but
[32:02] tonight Lord what I want is a complete
[32:05] unveiling and as we read this it's not
[32:07] just the unveiling or the uncovering of
[32:10] the person of Christ although that's
[32:13] exactly what it is but it is also the
[32:15] revelation of his Future Works down
[32:18] through the the coming ages and and it's
[32:21] full of Prophecy and it's full of
[32:23] symbols and because of that that's why
[32:25] most the people in the world that probe
[32:27] into this book are a million miles off
[32:30] because that they've not seen it Through
[32:32] The Eyes of a prophet and we have to
[32:34] admit ourselves that if it wasn't for
[32:36] Malachi 4 if it wasn't for Revelation 10
[32:39] 7 we would be in the exact same place
[32:42] that they are it's not for us to get
[32:44] lifted up and oh look at us we
[32:46] understand things but it's the mercy and
[32:48] Grace of almighty God that he sent a
[32:51] prophet in this day and not only did he
[32:53] send them Prophet but he allowed you to
[32:55] recognize that there was a prophet he
[32:57] allowed you to accept it as truth and
[33:00] because of that you see what the truth
[33:02] is because of that you can see it being
[33:04] unveiled and the sculptor pulling it off
[33:07] as we look at this book then we look at
[33:10] it as the revelation of his Future Works
[33:13] in the oncoming Seven Ages and many
[33:18] people look at that and there's no
[33:19] recognition of these churches being a
[33:22] period of time they just literally see
[33:24] them as churches but brother Branham
[33:27] tells us as we read this ordinary study
[33:30] is not going to open it up to you it
[33:32] takes a prophetic class of people with
[33:35] spiritual Revelation to get it and
[33:38] tonight I'd like to tell you that's you
[33:40] that's who you are you are a prophetic
[33:43] class of people because a prophet has
[33:45] come in this day to you and has begun to
[33:48] reveal these things and you as a people
[33:50] are able to sit there and say I believe
[33:52] that I receive that and because you sit
[33:55] underneath the prophet's message that
[33:58] makes you a prophetic class of people
[34:01] and it took a prophet coming in this day
[34:04] to unlock the Mysteries held down
[34:07] Through the Ages
[34:10] one of the major points
[34:12] of Revel of this first book that we had
[34:16] chaptered the revelation of Jesus Christ
[34:18] it deals with the importance of
[34:21] Revelation in your life and I have to
[34:23] admit even as I began to read this
[34:25] it struck me stronger than it ever had
[34:28] before how important Revelation is we've
[34:31] heard it said before but as you read
[34:33] through it the entire thing our entire
[34:36] experience our walk it's all based and
[34:39] rooted and the entire church is built
[34:41] upon Revelation brother Branham says the
[34:45] importance of Revelation by the spirit
[34:48] to a True Believer can never be over
[34:53] emphasized well what's that mean that
[34:55] means we can say at every service we can
[34:57] say it every day we can talk about it
[34:59] amongst our friends and you can never
[35:02] over emphasize the importance of
[35:06] spiritual Revelation to a believer
[35:10] and he says not the book but spiritual
[35:13] Revelation that comes to the belief that
[35:15] comes to the individual and then brother
[35:18] Branham immediately goes into Matthew
[35:21] 16.
[35:22] and Matthew 16 is a place that you're
[35:24] all very familiar with it is a place of
[35:28] personal testimony
[35:30] Matthew 16 is a place of personal
[35:34] testimony
[35:36] and he says
[35:38] and he said unto them but whom say ye
[35:43] that I am
[35:45] now every last one of us in this
[35:47] building at some point in our life have
[35:49] to come to this spot right here
[35:52] I want you to think about it you all
[35:54] have to come to this place that it
[35:56] doesn't matter what your friends say
[35:58] it doesn't matter what Mom and Dad say
[36:01] it doesn't even matter what brother Tim
[36:03] or brother Joe or brother Aaron says
[36:05] this isn't brother Aaron's Revelation
[36:07] but the spirit is coming to you tonight
[36:10] and he's asking you tonight who do you
[36:13] say that I am what is your testimony and
[36:18] it's bringing it down because when he
[36:20] first asked it there well this one says
[36:21] this and this one says this well well
[36:24] brother Joe says this and brother Tim
[36:26] preaches this and brother Aaron and my
[36:28] mom and dad say we believe this and the
[36:30] spirit say no no that's not what we're
[36:32] talking about tonight we're bringing
[36:34] this to a place of personal testimony
[36:36] who do you say that I am
[36:42] and he responds and Simon Peter answered
[36:45] and said Thou Art the Christ the son of
[36:49] the Living God and Jesus answered and
[36:51] said unto him blessed art thou Simon
[36:54] barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not
[36:56] revealed it unto thee but my Father
[36:59] which is in heaven now notice Flesh and
[37:03] Blood didn't do this
[37:04] mom and dad didn't give this to you
[37:09] I want you to understand that as as mom
[37:12] and dads we would love to give it to you
[37:16] it was the greatest desire of our heart
[37:18] that we want to see you get this
[37:20] Revelation that he is my savior that he
[37:22] is my God he is my Lord he is my we want
[37:26] you to have that so bad but I just can't
[37:29] give it to you now it's my job to teach
[37:31] you it's my job to talk to you about it
[37:34] as a dad and as parents that's our job
[37:36] to do but at the end of the day we can't
[37:38] give you that revelation we can't give
[37:40] you that personal experience but there
[37:43] is one who not only can but he wants to
[37:46] give it to you tonight he wants to
[37:48] reveal himself to you he wants to be
[37:50] your savior he wants to fill you with
[37:53] the baptism of the Holy Ghost he says
[37:55] but teachers didn't give this to you
[37:57] Seminary didn't give it to you your
[38:00] parents didn't give it to you but my
[38:02] Father which is in heaven he has given
[38:06] it to you
[38:07] and then he goes on and says
[38:10] and I say unto thee that thou art Peter
[38:14] and Upon This Rock I will build my
[38:17] church in the Gates of Hell shall not
[38:21] Prevail against it I want you to notice
[38:24] something here many times we jump there
[38:26] and talk about the Gates of Hell shall
[38:28] not Prevail and we'll get to that but in
[38:30] recognizing who Jesus is
[38:33] in having a real revelation of who Jesus
[38:36] is that's when you find out who you
[38:38] really are
[38:39] so many times people are searching who
[38:41] am I and I just want to know who I am
[38:43] and I just want to know where I fit in I
[38:45] just want a place to be I want people to
[38:48] love me and I'm telling you if you want
[38:49] to find yourself tonight find yourself
[38:51] in Jesus when you recognize He's Mine
[38:54] He's called me I'm called to be his I'm
[38:57] part of the Bride Jesus Is My Savior
[39:00] that's when you'll find out who you
[39:02] really are that's where you'll find out
[39:04] where you really fit in you may not fit
[39:06] in with this group or that group or this
[39:08] one or that one but you will always have
[39:10] a place in Jesus and nothing else really
[39:13] matters tonight I'm telling you put
[39:15] everything you got into finding him put
[39:18] everything you got into getting that
[39:19] Revelation where you can look at him and
[39:22] say thou art the Christ you're not just
[39:25] daddies but you're mine you're not just
[39:27] mamas but you're mine get to that place
[39:30] and you'll really find out who you
[39:33] really are it's in his recognition of
[39:36] that
[39:37] that he says Thou Art Peter and Upon
[39:42] This Rock I will build my church and the
[39:44] Gates of Hell shall not prevail
[39:47] against him
[39:49] so we see right here that the church is
[39:52] built on Revelation
[39:55] and now let's bring it down Beyond
[39:57] everybody
[39:58] your victories will be built on
[40:00] Revelation
[40:02] your walk will be built
[40:05] on Revelation revelation of who he is
[40:08] revelation of who you are and a
[40:11] revelation of what he's done for you
[40:14] when it has to go beyond teaching
[40:16] because good teaching is just that it's
[40:19] good okay but there there is a human
[40:22] element to that that someone could come
[40:23] along with a better argument they can
[40:25] come along and twist things but whenever
[40:27] you get a revelation of who he is and
[40:30] who you are and what he did for you then
[40:34] the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against
[40:36] that nobody can ever take a spiritual
[40:40] Revelation away from you
[40:44] brother Branham tells us here he says it
[40:46] isn't as the Protestants say that the
[40:48] church is built upon Jesus
[40:50] it was the revelation
[40:53] he says read it
[40:55] the way it's written Flesh and Blood
[40:58] hath not revealed it but my father hath
[41:01] revealed it and Upon This Rock
[41:03] Revelation I will build my church
[41:07] the church is built on Revelation on
[41:11] thus saith
[41:13] the Lord amen
[41:16] revelation
[41:18] brother Brown tells us that Satan hates
[41:22] the Book of Genesis
[41:24] and he hates the Book of Revelation the
[41:28] most now if we get right down to it I'm
[41:30] sure Satan hates all the word of God he
[41:33] hates everything there is about God but
[41:34] brother Branham comes in here and he
[41:36] tells us why these two books he says
[41:39] because he hates to be exposed
[41:44] and he says what these books do is they
[41:46] tell them his true origin
[41:48] they tell of his awful ways and then
[41:51] they tell of his destruction he says
[41:54] Revelation exposes him and his attacks
[41:59] brother Branham goes and he talks about
[42:01] when he's talking about how the devil
[42:02] hates to be exposed and he begins
[42:04] talking about he says I wish you could
[42:06] be with me in the discernment lines
[42:08] he says when when the the faces of the
[42:11] people and he makes it very clear he
[42:12] says I'm not talking about those people
[42:14] he said but the faces the look that
[42:16] comes across their face
[42:18] um during the discernment when the devil
[42:20] knows it's over when the devil knows
[42:24] he's about to be exposed I wish tonight
[42:28] that we could get a good look at his
[42:29] face because I believe with all my heart
[42:31] that there's a group of young people
[42:33] maybe he's tried to hold you down for a
[42:35] long time maybe he's tried to keep you
[42:37] bound and keeping you from coming to the
[42:39] revelation of who you are but tonight he
[42:42] is recognizing that he is about to be
[42:45] exposed he's lied to some of y'all long
[42:48] enough he's kept you from your
[42:50] privileges for some of you long enough
[42:51] but if you could ever just get that
[42:53] Revelation ain't that right sister
[42:55] Lauren if you ever recognize I'm gonna
[42:57] be there then there's nothing that the
[43:00] devil can do there's nothing he can say
[43:02] no doubt no lie no unbelief can come
[43:05] that will keep you from being there once
[43:08] you get that that I'm telling you he's
[43:09] going to lose his grip on your life and
[43:11] he recognizes he's about to be exposed
[43:14] and he hates that tonight Hallelujah he
[43:17] says Revelation exposes him and his
[43:21] attacks so he tries to minimize
[43:24] Revelation and destroy your confidence
[43:27] in the word
[43:30] destroy your confidence in the word
[43:33] whether that be by destroying your
[43:35] confidence in the ministry
[43:37] or whether that be by destroying your
[43:39] confidence because someone can come and
[43:41] say well this didn't exactly happen just
[43:43] like this or or this whatever he does he
[43:46] comes and tries to get you to second
[43:47] guess he comes and he tries to get you
[43:50] to begin to doubt but listen what
[43:52] brother Branham says when the church
[43:55] disbelieves Satan and believes the
[43:59] spirit's revelation of the word the
[44:02] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against her
[44:07] I think it's time for some of you here
[44:10] tonight to start disbelieving Satan and
[44:13] start believing what it is the spirit's
[44:15] been trying to tell you service after
[44:17] service after service you're not
[44:20] worthless you're not gonna fail you're
[44:22] not a sinner you're not bound for hell
[44:24] but you're a Son of God you're a
[44:26] daughter of God you're love the king of
[44:29] kings came he died for you he's calling
[44:32] you tonight it's the spirit speaking
[44:34] expressly to you tonight saying cast
[44:36] down the LIE of the enemy disbelieve
[44:39] Satan believe the spirit what's the
[44:41] spirit saying you are mine tonight he's
[44:45] calling out to you tonight and he's
[44:47] saying cast down that lie and when you
[44:49] begin to do that those chains begin to
[44:51] break off your life but as long as you
[44:53] believe this and you believe well my
[44:55] family's no good and and this and that
[44:57] and your eyes get on all those things
[44:59] you begin to have your confidence in the
[45:02] word destroyed listen it ain't about
[45:04] your family it ain't about me it ain't
[45:06] about brother Joe it ain't about brother
[45:07] Tim it's about what Jesus Christ did for
[45:11] you let's bring it back to that when you
[45:13] get a revelation of who he is in a
[45:16] revelation of who you are and what he
[45:18] did for you then the rest of it doesn't
[45:20] matter oh but Mama this and Daddy got
[45:24] his feelings hurt and this one that and
[45:25] that I said it's about you and it's
[45:28] about Jesus and when you get it back to
[45:30] that the Gates of Hell will not Prevail
[45:33] against you
[45:36] Hallelujah
[45:38] too many times we're walking around
[45:40] speaking the devil's language
[45:42] well I'm just a sinner
[45:44] I'm just a failure I'm just a Judas
[45:48] now the spirit says you're the purchase
[45:50] of My Blood
[45:52] listen don't take and minimize the power
[45:56] of the sacrifice
[45:59] by elevating the power of your flaws
[46:02] you just don't know this family curse
[46:06] you just don't know how often I've
[46:08] fallen to the same thing you just don't
[46:10] know I can never be saved
[46:13] I could never be delivered and what you
[46:15] do when you say those things is you
[46:17] actually minimize the effect of the
[46:20] atonement
[46:21] I'm telling you it's powerful enough
[46:23] tonight I'm telling you it's strong
[46:25] enough tonight I'm telling you it will
[46:27] overcome and defeat any hindering Spirit
[46:30] that's trying to keep you from the end
[46:32] goal and the end goal is a body change
[46:35] and a Rapture and the spirit's telling
[46:37] you tonight it's for you you're gonna
[46:39] make it how does he know he's going to
[46:41] make it because he paid the price for
[46:45] you he knows whose names on the Lamb's
[46:47] Book of Life he knows who you are and
[46:49] tonight he's trying to tell you who you
[46:51] are the devil's going it ain't you it
[46:53] ain't for you it ain't for you I'm
[46:55] telling you it is for you it was for you
[46:58] it's still for you he's still pleading
[47:00] the blood for you even now
[47:02] Hallelujah
[47:05] revelation
[47:08] I love this
[47:12] brother Mike if you're anywhere that can
[47:14] hear me and you could get me some water
[47:16] that'd be awesome
[47:19] brother Brown says let me show you
[47:21] another reason why Satan hates this book
[47:23] of the revelation
[47:25] the revelation of Jesus Christ in the
[47:27] church he knows that Jesus Christ is the
[47:32] same yesterday today and forever
[47:35] and he changes not
[47:38] he knows he knows that a whole lot more
[47:41] than do 90 percent of the theologians he
[47:44] knows that since God is immutable in his
[47:47] nature then he is just as immutable in
[47:50] his ways thus Satan knows assuredly that
[47:55] the original church at Pentecost with
[47:58] the power of God Mark 16 in action is
[48:02] the true church that Jesus claims as his
[48:05] own now that strikes me
[48:07] that almost knocks the socks off of me
[48:10] when brother Branham says Satan knows
[48:15] look we got a lot of people in our own
[48:17] ranks that we can't get to know this and
[48:18] Satan's a million miles ahead of him
[48:22] Satan knows that since God is immutable
[48:25] then he is just as immutable in his ways
[48:28] he knows us surely that the original
[48:30] church at Pentecost with the power of
[48:32] God Mark 16 in action is the true church
[48:36] that Jesus claims as his own all else is
[48:39] false it has to be
[48:44] listen young people as you begin to grow
[48:46] and and and in some ways you are already
[48:49] the the centerpiece of even like
[48:52] Tabernacle in some ways you're already
[48:55] the crown jewel
[48:57] I notice when y'all go to a youth camp
[48:59] and all and this right here is missing
[49:04] you don't even want to be in those song
[49:05] service I'm just saying
[49:07] old people man I know that's me too now
[49:11] but y'all are an incredible at you're
[49:13] more than an asset you you're this
[49:16] you're the future uh pillars of the
[49:20] church
[49:21] and one thing that the devil is going to
[49:23] try to do thank you so much it don't
[49:25] matter I appreciate it not too oh is
[49:27] that a cold versus warm I thought you
[49:29] was asking what brand water I like
[49:31] better
[49:33] perfect thank you
[49:36] as time goes on he more and more and
[49:39] more is going to try to talk you out of
[49:40] the power of a living God
[49:42] and he's going to try to bring you into
[49:44] that formalism because that's his attack
[49:47] that is his attack but brother Brown
[49:49] says now remember this Christ in the
[49:52] true church is a continuation of the
[49:56] book of Acts
[49:58] he says it exposes Satan's attempts to
[50:02] make the church lukewarm formal and
[50:06] Powerless why is Satan so against us
[50:08] preaching that that we're going back to
[50:10] the book of Acts and that we're a repeat
[50:12] and and that we're repeating or a
[50:15] continuation I should say of the book of
[50:17] Acts why is he against that because if
[50:20] you'll go back and see how he was
[50:22] treated in those books if you'll go back
[50:24] and look at what Mark 16 says you're
[50:26] going to do if you'll go back and see
[50:28] how he was cast out in the book of Acts
[50:30] then you recognize he doesn't want a
[50:33] church walking around operating in that
[50:35] power of course he wants you to believe
[50:37] you can't cast him out of course he
[50:40] wants you to believe that Mark 16 17
[50:42] says and these signs shall follow them
[50:44] that believe in my name they shall cast
[50:47] out Devils they shall speak with new
[50:50] tongues they shall take up serpents and
[50:52] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[50:54] not hurt them for they shall lay hands
[50:57] on the sick and they shall recover so
[51:00] he's telling you that's not you that's
[51:02] not who you are that's not what you're
[51:03] going to be of course he tells you that
[51:05] because when you're that then Satan is
[51:08] cast out when you're that then the sick
[51:10] are healed when you're that people are
[51:12] filled with the Holy Ghost so he comes
[51:14] and he says that's not you that's not
[51:16] you that's not you but we want her to
[51:18] tell him tonight you're too late
[51:19] Revelation has already struck our heart
[51:22] and when we read that we say that's me I
[51:25] can cast out the devil I can face deadly
[51:27] things I can overcome anything that
[51:29] comes my way because that's who I am
[51:33] and he hates it because it exposes who
[51:37] he is
[51:40] Hallelujah
[51:42] he says he knows that if the people get
[51:45] the true revelation
[51:48] of the true church and what she is and
[51:51] what she stands for and that she can do
[51:54] the Greater Works she will be an
[51:57] invincible Army
[51:59] well of course he tells you don't preach
[52:02] this
[52:03] he tells you don't believe this of
[52:06] course he says it's for another day what
[52:08] does he want with facing an invincible
[52:10] Army Invincible means you can't be beat
[52:14] he has to keep you from getting that
[52:17] true Revelation because if my equation
[52:19] is right if you get that Revelation
[52:21] you're never going to lose once you get
[52:24] that Revelation he's never going to win
[52:27] so he fights it and brother Brown says
[52:30] yes Satan hates Revelation but there is
[52:35] a people on the Earth that can say but
[52:37] we love it we say Lord pour it out I
[52:40] need more Revelation brother Brown says
[52:42] you asked for Revelation you pray for
[52:44] revelation we love revelation
[52:49] the Revelation that you are that church
[52:51] called to do the Greater Works the
[52:54] Revelation that you are that church that
[52:56] isn't just here trying to learn but has
[52:58] an ear that can hear what the spirit
[53:00] says call to understand called to
[53:03] receive a message called to take a
[53:06] rapture
[53:07] it is the revelation
[53:09] that defeats the enemy brother Brandon
[53:11] would say it is the revelation of God
[53:13] that will give you authority over the
[53:18] devil
[53:18] so of course he fights revelation
[53:22] he hates Revelation and he tries to do
[53:25] away with the supernatural aspect and
[53:27] make it something that you just learned
[53:31] just learn this just just read this and
[53:34] say but no when you read something say
[53:36] Lord
[53:37] reveal this to me May It Go deeper than
[53:40] a head knowledge but Lord May something
[53:42] take anchor on the inside of me that I
[53:46] know beyond any shadow of a doubt that
[53:47] you put there that this is truth open
[53:51] your word to to me Lord
[53:54] Revelations 1 4-6
[53:57] it says John to the seven churches which
[54:01] are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace
[54:05] from him which is
[54:07] which was and which is to come
[54:10] and from the seven spirits which are
[54:12] before his throne
[54:15] and from Jesus Christ who is the
[54:17] faithful witness I love the descriptions
[54:20] of Jesus here
[54:21] the first begotten of the dead and the
[54:24] prince of the kings of the earth unto
[54:26] him that loved us and washed us from our
[54:29] sins and his own blood and hath made us
[54:31] Kings and Priests unto God and his
[54:35] father to him be glory and Dominion
[54:38] forever and ever
[54:40] amen this starts off in verse 4 saying
[54:43] John to the seven churches which are in
[54:46] Asia now when they say Asia what they
[54:49] literally are referring to is what was
[54:51] known as Asia Minor I know you probably
[54:54] can't see all the the small writing
[54:56] there
[54:57] but I just wanted you to to be able to
[54:59] place this in your mind when we talk
[55:00] about these churches where they're at
[55:04] so if you look on the far left you see
[55:06] Italy
[55:08] a little bit more to the east you see
[55:10] Greece
[55:11] and you come a little bit further that
[55:13] big Peninsula this ain't going to show
[55:15] up on there it don't show up on the
[55:17] screen but you see Asia Minor there in
[55:19] the Box
[55:20] it's that large Peninsula right there if
[55:23] you come South you'll see Jerusalem so
[55:25] that area the peninsula specifically
[55:28] over by the the ocean on the west side
[55:30] of that Peninsula is where you find the
[55:33] seven churches
[55:34] of Asia Minor if you look at it it was
[55:39] roughly 290
[55:41] 000 square miles that probably means
[55:43] nothing to you so just so you can place
[55:45] it a little bit that's about the size of
[55:47] Texas Asia Minor would be about the same
[55:50] size as Texas now we're going to zoom in
[55:53] just for a moment so that you can see
[55:55] this a little closer
[55:57] and this is Asia Minor and you see the
[55:59] church as their Ephesus Smyrna pergamon
[56:02] thytera Sardis Philadelphia and laodicea
[56:08] why
[56:09] are these the only churches mentioned
[56:12] surely in an area the size of Texas
[56:14] there were more than seven churches
[56:17] more than that that had sprung up surely
[56:20] there were more than just those and why
[56:22] doesn't it mention Antioch or Earth
[56:24] thessalonica why specifically these
[56:28] seven and what we'll find as we go
[56:30] through the church age book and study is
[56:32] that these cities were specifically
[56:34] picked for their unique characteristics
[56:37] these character the characteristics of
[56:39] these seven churches are exactly the
[56:42] same characteristics that each of the
[56:45] seven Church Ages were going to have
[56:47] down through history so in other words
[56:50] these churches Ephesus Smyrna pergaman
[56:54] thotara Sardis Philadelphia laodicea
[56:57] represent periods of time when we read
[57:01] about them in the Book of Revelation so
[57:04] as we go we're going to see that each of
[57:05] these seven churches represent an age
[57:08] that was to come
[57:11] and each age is going to have a
[57:13] messenger that will speak God's word for
[57:16] that day and now sometimes people will
[57:18] say well isn't God's word always the
[57:20] same what do you mean by God's word for
[57:22] that day and the the most the easiest
[57:25] way to explain this is
[57:28] Moses had a message for his day God's
[57:32] word is always God's word but it was the
[57:34] message needed in that moment for that
[57:36] time Noah had a message for his day
[57:39] God's word never changes but that was
[57:42] the word the portion that was needed in
[57:45] that day to make sure that they escaped
[57:49] and so in each age there would be
[57:51] another portion that was revealed and
[57:53] there would be a messenger that would
[57:55] come in that time for that age
[58:01] and so as we go into this one of the
[58:02] things we're going to focus on for the
[58:04] next few minutes because this is what
[58:06] brother Brown really focuses on in
[58:07] chapter one
[58:10] is the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ
[58:16] now
[58:18] I'm not brother Tim
[58:21] I can't break down the godhead quite
[58:23] like he can
[58:24] or even close
[58:27] but we're just going to try to get us
[58:29] all to the same place that we have no
[58:31] question
[58:33] that God is one
[58:35] that there aren't three Gods now I know
[58:38] you all believe that
[58:41] but we want it to be a revelation we
[58:44] want something to Anchor deep down to
[58:46] where it can't be talked out of us
[58:49] So speaking of revelation we must have
[58:52] the revelation of the Supreme deity
[58:55] of Jesus Christ
[58:59] brother Branham says the greatest of all
[59:01] Revelations is the deity the Supreme
[59:04] deity of our Lord Jesus Christ so take a
[59:07] minute and let's put some things
[59:08] together he says you can never emphasize
[59:11] Revelation too much
[59:13] and then he says the greatest Revelation
[59:15] is the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ put
[59:18] those two things together and I would
[59:20] say it is very important that we seek
[59:21] for the proper Revelation not just on
[59:24] paper not just what Mom and Dad believe
[59:26] but within ourselves of the Supreme
[59:28] deity of the Lord Jesus Christ because
[59:30] brother Branham goes on to say you can't
[59:32] get to first base until you believe that
[59:36] you can't even get started in your
[59:39] Christian walk until you believe in the
[59:41] Supreme deity of the Lord Jesus Christ
[59:45] brother Brown says it's a mighty
[59:47] Revelation and what we see here is is
[59:50] the Revelation that the very first
[59:52] church age had God is one
[59:57] the the Lord Jesus as we read as you
[1:00:00] read through you will find that he has
[1:00:01] many titles that are attributed to him
[1:00:03] to show his greatness there in this
[1:00:05] passage we just read he's Alpha and
[1:00:08] Omega first born from among the dead
[1:00:10] Prince of the kings of the Earth the
[1:00:12] almighty and people recognize these as
[1:00:14] titles
[1:00:15] but then when they see father
[1:00:18] son Holy Ghost all of a sudden it's
[1:00:22] oh wait wait there's three of him
[1:00:24] well all these other titles we attribute
[1:00:27] to one
[1:00:28] we don't say well the alpha omega is one
[1:00:31] distinct person and the firstborn's a
[1:00:33] distinct person and then the prince no
[1:00:35] they're just titles that would describe
[1:00:36] him and that's what we find with Father
[1:00:39] Son and Holy Ghost but many people today
[1:00:42] believe that there are three Gods
[1:00:44] instead of one now they will they'll
[1:00:46] talk to you and they'll say no no we
[1:00:47] believe in one God
[1:00:49] but they believe in three distinct
[1:00:52] persons
[1:00:53] in one God and brother Branham would
[1:00:56] even make the statement he says not only
[1:00:58] is there no Bible for it he says there's
[1:01:01] not even good reasoning there he said
[1:01:03] there's not even Common Sense there so
[1:01:06] so it isn't that there's three Gods but
[1:01:08] there's one God tonight with three
[1:01:11] offices or three titles father son
[1:01:15] and Holy Ghost what we find is there is
[1:01:18] a great error what we would call the
[1:01:20] error of the Trinity and I'm going to
[1:01:22] read these two excerpts here brother
[1:01:23] Brown will put them in the church age
[1:01:24] book he says they came from a Christian
[1:01:26] magazine if you do a little bit of
[1:01:28] research you will find that this is
[1:01:30] pretty standard as far as what most of
[1:01:33] your nominal churches will believe
[1:01:35] this is their belief yet the New
[1:01:38] Testament with equal clearness teaches
[1:01:40] that the father is God
[1:01:42] and the son is God and the Holy Spirit
[1:01:45] is God and that these three are not
[1:01:49] three aspects of the same person uh oh
[1:01:55] but three persons
[1:01:58] standing in a truly personal
[1:02:00] relationship to one another if you've
[1:02:03] ever wondered what do trinitarians
[1:02:05] believe here you go
[1:02:09] they also State God according to the
[1:02:12] Bible is not just one person
[1:02:16] but he is three persons
[1:02:19] in one God
[1:02:23] that is the great mystery of the Trinity
[1:02:27] and brother Branham says it sure is
[1:02:32] he talks about how a woman comes to him
[1:02:34] and says but brother Branham aren't you
[1:02:36] and your wife one
[1:02:39] and he says yes but not like that he
[1:02:43] says do you see me right now she says
[1:02:45] yeah he says do you see my wife
[1:02:49] no but when you saw Jesus he said if
[1:02:52] you've seen me
[1:02:54] you've seen the father
[1:02:57] if you've seen me you've seen the father
[1:03:00] Revelation 1 8 says I am Alpha and Omega
[1:03:04] the beginning and the ending saith the
[1:03:08] Lord which is which was which is to come
[1:03:12] the
[1:03:13] almighty who is Jesus he's deity he is
[1:03:18] the almighty he's not just a a person of
[1:03:21] the Trinity he's not just a person he is
[1:03:24] the person he is almighty God
[1:03:28] so how did it get so messed up
[1:03:31] how did it get so messed up from from
[1:03:33] there at the beginning where they had
[1:03:35] this truth
[1:03:37] men
[1:03:39] we have a supreme talent for messing
[1:03:42] things up
[1:03:44] it amazes me
[1:03:47] even in the Simplicity of
[1:03:51] Church going ons or or a meeting or this
[1:03:56] how things can be announced run thrown a
[1:03:59] screen talked about for weeks and then
[1:04:02] people get it wrong
[1:04:04] Oh I thought it was I thought it was at
[1:04:07] seven
[1:04:09] well that's no big deal just human error
[1:04:11] exactly so now imagine getting Bunches
[1:04:15] of theologians together and this idea
[1:04:17] and that idea and we're not talking
[1:04:20] about simple things the Bible talks
[1:04:21] about what a great mystery these things
[1:04:23] are
[1:04:24] and you start getting well I think this
[1:04:25] and I think that and the next thing you
[1:04:27] know it's all scrupled up it's all
[1:04:30] messed up and then when they get things
[1:04:31] messed up they get together and they try
[1:04:33] to fix it and in so doing they come to
[1:04:36] an agreement and they get all their
[1:04:38] mess-ups and all my mess ups and we
[1:04:40] agree on some of the mess ups and go
[1:04:41] okay that's the truth for now on so what
[1:04:44] they do is they agree to to agree on
[1:04:46] something and yet it's not the truth
[1:04:49] always keep that in mind
[1:04:53] just because people agree with you
[1:04:55] doesn't mean you're right
[1:04:57] I don't know where that's coming from
[1:04:58] but let's just talk about that just
[1:05:00] because you get people around you that
[1:05:02] see it your way
[1:05:04] doesn't make it right I would like to
[1:05:06] remind you that there was a lot of
[1:05:08] angels that agreed with Lucifer
[1:05:12] they weren't right
[1:05:15] you stand on your convictions of what
[1:05:17] the word says the word is what's right
[1:05:20] the word is truth not what your friend
[1:05:22] says not what they think is okay the
[1:05:24] word is where truth is at
[1:05:27] not seeing counsel 325 A.D
[1:05:31] in the beginning brother Brown says they
[1:05:34] didn't believe in three gods in the
[1:05:36] beginning
[1:05:37] of the church
[1:05:39] so they all come together in modern day
[1:05:41] Turkey which was in Asia Minor then I
[1:05:45] see in Council and it was a great
[1:05:46] Council was held to address certain
[1:05:48] doctrinal debates that had risen up in
[1:05:50] the church
[1:05:52] and if you study it all and pay
[1:05:54] attention and all that's how the spirit
[1:05:55] of denomination works it's always done
[1:05:58] to protect truth well this is true so we
[1:06:00] need to protect it this is true so we
[1:06:02] need to protect it and they come
[1:06:04] together and they establish what truth
[1:06:05] is and they and they try to protect it
[1:06:07] and here at this meeting they form the
[1:06:09] dogmas of Catholicism that eventually
[1:06:12] was handed down into the Protestant
[1:06:15] churches this is where the Trinity comes
[1:06:18] into play that we hear about today the
[1:06:20] trinitarian doctrine begins at the
[1:06:23] Nicene Council and it becomes a
[1:06:26] foundational Doctrine here in 325 and
[1:06:28] the reason it happened was you had
[1:06:30] Constantine who was a Roman Emperor who
[1:06:32] had accepted Christianity and yet it
[1:06:35] wasn't something that was
[1:06:37] um being easily accepted amongst the
[1:06:39] Romans because the Romans were
[1:06:41] polytheists which means they had many
[1:06:43] gods they worshiped Venus and Mars and
[1:06:46] Jupiter just just a few of the many
[1:06:48] maybe even hundreds I'm not sure how
[1:06:50] many they have but it was a lot
[1:06:52] and now all of a sudden you have this
[1:06:54] which is which they see is just one God
[1:06:57] and they and they couldn't make it work
[1:06:59] they were used to praying to their dead
[1:07:01] ancestors and they saw a certain truth
[1:07:02] to this and so what they did was they
[1:07:04] took certain truth and they hybridized
[1:07:06] it what you see here is even a type of
[1:07:08] what happened there in the garden where
[1:07:10] truth was mixed with a lie and when
[1:07:13] truth is mixed with a lie what is there
[1:07:14] always the end result death
[1:07:17] and so they began to mix truth with a
[1:07:20] lie and they're used to praying to their
[1:07:22] ancestors so you can see how easy it was
[1:07:24] for them to to blend their Pagan
[1:07:26] religion right over into Christianity
[1:07:28] they split God into three and they
[1:07:31] continued to pray to the dead now it
[1:07:33] wasn't too necessarily their ancestors
[1:07:35] but they made Saints of those that had
[1:07:37] died and and they would pray to Peter
[1:07:39] and they would pray to Paul and pray to
[1:07:41] Christopher and all the different ones
[1:07:42] and and starting right there the
[1:07:46] revelation of one God operated in three
[1:07:49] offices began to be lost
[1:07:52] and the Creed of three persons in one
[1:07:55] God began to be accepted right there
[1:07:59] during that time and
[1:08:02] so we're going to take a second and look
[1:08:03] at some biblical truth
[1:08:09] Matthew
[1:08:12] 1 18.
[1:08:14] it says now the birth of Jesus Christ
[1:08:16] was on this wise when as his mother was
[1:08:18] espoused to Joseph before they came
[1:08:21] together she was found with child of God
[1:08:24] the Father
[1:08:28] it's not what it says
[1:08:30] found with child of the
[1:08:33] I'm gonna make y'all wake up all
[1:08:34] together
[1:08:35] Holy Ghost all found with child of the
[1:08:40] Holy Ghost so we see right here that God
[1:08:42] the father as some would express it and
[1:08:46] God the Holy Spirit have to be the same
[1:08:49] or else we have Jesus with two fathers
[1:08:53] everyone no no no the father is his
[1:08:55] father well that says the Holy Ghost was
[1:08:58] his father now you're going to have to
[1:09:00] explain that and you're probably going
[1:09:02] to get down into things you don't want
[1:09:03] to talk about
[1:09:06] how is this possible because God the
[1:09:08] father as some would Express and the
[1:09:11] Holy Ghost
[1:09:12] are one in the same
[1:09:14] they are the same there is but one God
[1:09:18] because Jesus himself brother Brandon
[1:09:20] would say but Jesus himself claimed that
[1:09:23] God was his father
[1:09:27] so which is it you have to make the two
[1:09:29] go together they have to be the same we
[1:09:32] have to come to the conclusion there is
[1:09:35] but one God
[1:09:37] amen how many believes that he says the
[1:09:40] god that tabernacled above the tents of
[1:09:43] Israel now took on himself a tent of
[1:09:45] Flesh and tabernacled as a man amongst
[1:09:50] men but he was the same God
[1:09:56] we're going to bring this down to a
[1:09:57] point as we begin to the downhill part
[1:10:00] of this as it were and I want us to get
[1:10:02] focused on that Jesus was God not part
[1:10:06] of God not a peace of God not one-third
[1:10:10] of God he was God he says the Bible
[1:10:14] teaches
[1:10:17] that God was in Christ the body was
[1:10:20] Jesus in him dwelt all the fullness of
[1:10:26] the godhead bodily brother Branham says
[1:10:30] he was Christ but he was given a name
[1:10:32] down here among men that outward
[1:10:35] Tabernacle men could see was called
[1:10:37] Jesus he was The Lord Of Glory the
[1:10:41] almighty manifested in flesh he is God
[1:10:44] the Father Son and Holy Ghost he is all
[1:10:49] of that
[1:10:50] God manifested In the Flesh
[1:10:54] First Timothy 3 16 says and without
[1:10:56] controversy great is the mystery of
[1:10:59] godliness
[1:11:01] God was manifested in the flesh
[1:11:03] justified in the spirit scene of angels
[1:11:06] preached unto the Gentiles believed on
[1:11:09] in the world and received up into Glory
[1:11:12] who was God the son
[1:11:15] God the Father
[1:11:17] God
[1:11:19] God was
[1:11:22] he says there is one God and that one
[1:11:26] God was manifest In the Flesh and named
[1:11:32] Jesus
[1:11:34] he's the all-in-all he's the Alpha and
[1:11:38] the Omega he's the Creator he's the
[1:11:40] savior of your soul he's the one
[1:11:42] Knocking at Your Heart tonight he's the
[1:11:44] one telling you that I am God and I'm
[1:11:46] big enough for your problem I am God I
[1:11:48] can deal with that depression I am God I
[1:11:51] can turn your life around there's no sin
[1:11:53] too big there's no there's no mountain I
[1:11:56] won't climb up I am God
[1:12:01] what happens is people get confused by
[1:12:04] titles
[1:12:06] these are just titles
[1:12:10] let them you'll stand up
[1:12:15] are you a brother
[1:12:17] you are are you a son
[1:12:20] are you a cousin
[1:12:23] your nephew
[1:12:25] you can have your seat
[1:12:27] I only saw one person and I saw a son I
[1:12:32] saw a nephew I saw a brother those are
[1:12:35] titles or offices that he holds
[1:12:38] but he's just Lemuel
[1:12:41] he is not a trinity of limules
[1:12:47] he's just living and yet he is those
[1:12:49] things
[1:12:50] Jesus is the Father the Son
[1:12:54] the Holy Ghost brother Brown says he is
[1:12:56] all of that
[1:12:58] these are just titles like our
[1:13:01] righteousness Rose of Sharon our peace
[1:13:04] Father Son and Holy Ghost but none of
[1:13:07] these are his name
[1:13:09] they are offices or we would say roles
[1:13:13] he came in the flesh as son to die he
[1:13:17] came in the flesh To Be Our Redeemer he
[1:13:19] came back in the form of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:22] who you keep saying he he came he
[1:13:25] created he died he went to hell he rose
[1:13:28] again he ascended he came back in the
[1:13:31] form of the Holy Ghost Jesus
[1:13:35] he is all of that the deity of the Lord
[1:13:38] Jesus Christ brother Branham says the
[1:13:40] most important of Revelations
[1:13:42] he says you can't get to first base
[1:13:45] without that revelation
[1:13:50] brother Brown would tell us don't be
[1:13:52] confused because he has three offices or
[1:13:54] that he has a three-fold manifestation
[1:13:59] he that was
[1:14:00] Jesus the prophet he that is the high
[1:14:03] priest making intercession for you right
[1:14:06] now and he which is to come the soon
[1:14:09] coming King on Earth he was a lamb he
[1:14:14] was a prophet and he was a son
[1:14:17] but he was Jesus
[1:14:20] he was all three of those things and yet
[1:14:22] he that didn't make him three they were
[1:14:25] manifestations of one person Jesus was
[1:14:30] the lamb he was a prophet like unto
[1:14:32] Moses and he was the son of God he was
[1:14:35] the sacrifice he is your Redeemer he is
[1:14:38] our all in all that is descriptions of
[1:14:42] the one and only Lord Jesus Christ you
[1:14:46] say You're really belaboring this point
[1:14:48] absolutely brother Branham says it is
[1:14:50] the greatest of all Revelations we could
[1:14:53] never emphasize it enough he is all of
[1:14:56] that brother Branham says
[1:14:58] I love this right here Revelation 15 and
[1:15:00] 3.
[1:15:02] it says and they sing the song of Moses
[1:15:05] the servant of God pay close attention
[1:15:07] to this
[1:15:08] the servant of God and the song of the
[1:15:11] Lamb we're talking about the lamb
[1:15:15] now somebody give me the human name of
[1:15:18] the Lamb
[1:15:20] it's okay we're in church say it loud
[1:15:23] uh one more time
[1:15:24] Jesus
[1:15:26] that's the lamb we know that right
[1:15:29] so we're talking about
[1:15:31] the the serve the song of the lamb and
[1:15:35] what does the song of Jesus the lamb say
[1:15:37] great and marvelous are thy Works Lord
[1:15:42] God
[1:15:44] Almighty just and true are thy ways Thou
[1:15:49] King of saints
[1:15:51] the lamb once slain the high priest who
[1:15:55] is it the Lord God Almighty
[1:16:00] as plain as day right there in the word
[1:16:03] who is Jesus the Lord God
[1:16:08] Almighty and where do we see him at
[1:16:11] his current office is lamb
[1:16:15] the offices change young people
[1:16:17] his current office
[1:16:20] is lamb
[1:16:22] there is the high priest holding his
[1:16:24] blood on The Mercy Seat
[1:16:26] is the Lord God Almighty who is it
[1:16:29] pleading for you the Lord God Almighty
[1:16:32] who is it that died for you the Lord God
[1:16:35] Almighty
[1:16:36] who is it beckoning to your soul tonight
[1:16:39] just come a little bit closer surrender
[1:16:42] yourself to me it's the Lord God
[1:16:44] Almighty
[1:16:46] and why is it that it's so important why
[1:16:48] now what's the hurry wise because at
[1:16:51] some point that's going to change and
[1:16:53] the lamb becomes the lion of the tribe
[1:16:56] of Judah
[1:16:58] and when he takes on that role then
[1:17:00] there's no more intercessor on The Mercy
[1:17:03] Seat and what he's saying to you tonight
[1:17:04] is while he is the Lamb while he's
[1:17:07] pleading the blood he's telling you
[1:17:09] tonight accept me in this role accept me
[1:17:11] as your sacrifice accept me as
[1:17:14] intercessor except the blood tonight
[1:17:16] settle the question tonight settle this
[1:17:19] question that is who do you say that I
[1:17:23] am
[1:17:24] who am I to you tonight
[1:17:27] what is my role in your life tonight
[1:17:30] what is our relationship tonight
[1:17:35] because it won't always be Islam
[1:17:37] you say well isn't he King now
[1:17:41] yes but not King of the Earth
[1:17:44] he's the king of saints
[1:17:46] he's the coming King of the Earth but
[1:17:49] right now he is the king of saints
[1:17:52] because brother Branham would teach us
[1:17:54] here in this first chapter
[1:17:56] that his kingdom right now is not an
[1:17:59] Earthly Kingdom but it is a spiritual
[1:18:02] Kingdom in other words young people
[1:18:04] we're not from here
[1:18:06] that's why we act different
[1:18:10] talk different
[1:18:11] dress different
[1:18:13] feed different
[1:18:16] listen if you're eating out the cattle
[1:18:18] trough if you're a cow
[1:18:21] if you're eating with the pigs in the
[1:18:23] pig slop you're a Pig why do you say
[1:18:27] that brother Aaron you can't claim to be
[1:18:29] one thing but feeding on other things
[1:18:32] you're going to feed on
[1:18:35] look what's the oldest saying people
[1:18:37] said like in in third grade you are what
[1:18:39] you
[1:18:44] well
[1:18:46] let me tell you the devil's children
[1:18:48] feed on Non-Stop Hollywood
[1:18:52] the devil's children feed on the movie
[1:18:54] stars the devil's children feed on the
[1:18:57] slop of the world I'm not calling
[1:18:59] anybody anything I've already told you
[1:19:00] what the spirit's telling you you are
[1:19:02] your sons and daughters of God I'm
[1:19:04] asking you what are you eating
[1:19:08] because if you're part of that Kingdom
[1:19:10] and you've allowed him voluntarily to
[1:19:13] come and be your king then it'll change
[1:19:15] the way you act it'll change the way you
[1:19:17] talk it'll change the way you treat
[1:19:18] others it'll change the way you dress
[1:19:20] it'll change the things it'll change
[1:19:22] your appetite
[1:19:23] I'll never forget brother Joe during
[1:19:25] that the Holy Ghost series that he
[1:19:26] preached there a few years back and he
[1:19:29] just hammered that over and over and
[1:19:31] over again that when you get the Holy
[1:19:34] Ghost your desires will change
[1:19:37] it's not anymore oh I want those things
[1:19:40] but I just can't have them no that's you
[1:19:42] keeping a law
[1:19:45] but when the Holy Ghost comes on the
[1:19:47] inside of you and you allow him to be
[1:19:48] your king then it changes those desires
[1:19:51] you no longer want to feed with the pigs
[1:19:53] you don't want to do those things but
[1:19:55] see it's coming a time where every
[1:19:57] Kingdom of this world is going to be
[1:19:58] torn down and destroyed you don't want
[1:20:00] to find yourself in that Kingdom you
[1:20:03] want to be in his kingdom now because
[1:20:05] he's going to be king whether it's by
[1:20:07] takeover
[1:20:08] or whether it's because you chose to
[1:20:10] serve him
[1:20:11] because when he comes back every other
[1:20:13] Kingdom will be torn down but tonight
[1:20:14] he's offering you a position and a place
[1:20:17] in his kingdom he offers you power over
[1:20:21] the kingdoms of the world he's telling
[1:20:23] you tonight you can be filled with Jesus
[1:20:26] you can be filled with the baptism of
[1:20:28] the Holy Ghost not a third person of the
[1:20:31] Trinity you can be filled with the
[1:20:33] person you can lay it all down tonight
[1:20:35] you know where your struggles oh well
[1:20:37] brother Aaron this ain't really
[1:20:38] Evangelistic that doesn't matter a bit
[1:20:40] we're talking about the word of God and
[1:20:42] the word of God says the promise is unto
[1:20:44] you and to your children and to as many
[1:20:46] as the Lord God shall call even them
[1:20:49] that are far off so I don't care where
[1:20:51] you're at tonight in your relationship
[1:20:52] with God you may be millions of miles
[1:20:55] away you may be so far away but tonight
[1:20:57] the spirit of God is calling you and
[1:20:59] saying you can be in this Kingdom you
[1:21:02] don't have to serve the devil anymore
[1:21:04] you don't have to be here when that
[1:21:06] Kingdom's torn down but you can be in
[1:21:08] the Kingdom of the king of kings the
[1:21:10] king of saints and he's calling you
[1:21:12] tonight to your position within that
[1:21:15] Kingdom
[1:21:16] amen
[1:21:21] revelation of Jesus Christ continued
[1:21:24] John 14 16.
[1:21:27] he says I will pray the father and he
[1:21:29] shall give you another comforter
[1:21:32] that may abide with you forever even the
[1:21:35] spirit of Truth whom the world cannot
[1:21:36] receive because it seeth him not neither
[1:21:39] knoweth him but ye know him for he
[1:21:41] dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[1:21:45] and what he's saying here is he said
[1:21:47] that he would pray to the father within
[1:21:49] another comforter who was with them
[1:21:51] already
[1:21:52] so who was with them
[1:21:55] who was with the disciples
[1:21:58] we can say it again it's his house
[1:22:01] Jesus
[1:22:03] it's Jesus
[1:22:05] he says but ye know him for he dwelleth
[1:22:08] with you
[1:22:09] in other words I'm with you right now
[1:22:11] I'm talking about me he's what are you
[1:22:12] saying
[1:22:14] but I'm going to be
[1:22:18] in you the same one that's dwelling with
[1:22:21] you is going to be the one that is in
[1:22:25] you
[1:22:25] he says and I will not leave you
[1:22:28] comfortless
[1:22:30] I will come to you it's plain as day
[1:22:33] so who's the Holy Ghost going to be ah
[1:22:37] well who's speaking right here Jesus
[1:22:40] he says I'm going to come to you I'm not
[1:22:43] going to leave you comfortless I'm gonna
[1:22:45] be the one that comes yet a little while
[1:22:47] in the world seeth me no more but ye see
[1:22:50] me because I live you shall live also
[1:22:52] and at that day you shall know that I am
[1:22:54] in my father and ye in me and
[1:22:58] the Holy Ghost In You
[1:23:03] I in you I mean you could say the Holy
[1:23:06] Ghost in you because that's who I is
[1:23:10] somewhere my high school English
[1:23:12] teachers went oh
[1:23:15] two we're talking about he's all of that
[1:23:19] he says the spirit is coming The Same
[1:23:21] Spirit that manifested as the father
[1:23:23] then manifested as the son and then came
[1:23:26] back on the day of Pentecost and
[1:23:28] manifested in
[1:23:30] many
[1:23:32] it's all the same it's all the same Lord
[1:23:35] Jesus
[1:23:37] Jehovah of the Old Testament
[1:23:39] is Jesus of the New Testament brother
[1:23:42] Brown says now that is the revelation
[1:23:47] Jesus Christ is God
[1:23:51] the Jehovah of the Old Testament is the
[1:23:54] Jesus of the new no matter how hard you
[1:23:56] try you can't prove there are three Gods
[1:23:58] but it also takes a revelation by the
[1:24:01] Holy Spirit to make you understand the
[1:24:03] truth that he is one it takes a
[1:24:06] revelation to see that the Jehovah of
[1:24:09] the Old Testament is the Jesus of the
[1:24:12] new
[1:24:14] this is why we don't baptize in titles
[1:24:16] this is why that Matthew 28 19 that
[1:24:21] doesn't confuse us
[1:24:23] go ye therefore and teach All Nations
[1:24:27] baptizing them
[1:24:29] in the name of the father and of the son
[1:24:32] and of the Holy Ghost let me tell you a
[1:24:35] little story real quick
[1:24:38] brother Joe and I were baptizing at
[1:24:40] Youth Camp
[1:24:41] you've seen how we do it and they they
[1:24:43] come down everybody's around the
[1:24:44] swimming pool and we're standing there
[1:24:46] and this this brother that was getting
[1:24:47] baptized there at Camp was probably
[1:24:49] around you say about 40 years old
[1:24:50] brother Joe maybe 45 something like that
[1:24:52] he was a middle-aged fella and he comes
[1:24:55] walking out there and
[1:24:56] and and just to be honest with you when
[1:24:58] you're baptized in one after another
[1:25:00] like that you kind of get into a routine
[1:25:02] you know as you're going and and brother
[1:25:05] Joe will baptize one then I'll baptize
[1:25:06] one and brother Joe and this this
[1:25:08] brother Combs and I say
[1:25:10] I say you know the Lord commissioned me
[1:25:12] and sent me into the world
[1:25:14] and told me to baptize those that would
[1:25:16] believe in the name of the father and of
[1:25:18] the son and of the Holy Ghost and right
[1:25:21] there that man he goes whoa whoa whoa
[1:25:25] whoa whoa
[1:25:26] right
[1:25:27] he said you are about to baptize me in
[1:25:30] the name of Jesus ain't you
[1:25:33] me and brother Joe had to kind of hold
[1:25:35] it together for me I said yes sir you
[1:25:36] just give me a minute that's
[1:25:38] it's coming next that's that's where
[1:25:40] we're going but it doesn't confuse us
[1:25:43] because we recognize that the father and
[1:25:46] the Son and the Holy Ghost are not names
[1:25:48] and it says baptize in thee
[1:25:51] name
[1:25:53] now I could Rock right here and I could
[1:25:55] say
[1:25:57] nephew
[1:25:58] son
[1:26:05] cousin
[1:26:07] could have called a lot of people
[1:26:10] but if I say let me know
[1:26:14] you know who I'm talking to don't you
[1:26:16] yeah
[1:26:19] the name what is that name have we got
[1:26:21] that established
[1:26:23] can we say it there we go
[1:26:25] we're getting there
[1:26:27] that's why we can look right here
[1:26:29] at Acts 2 38 then Peter said unto them
[1:26:32] repent and be baptized every one of you
[1:26:33] in the name of
[1:26:35] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[1:26:38] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:26:41] Holy Ghost we obey Matthew 28 19. when
[1:26:46] we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:26:49] Christ
[1:26:50] we do that as you've heard brother Tim
[1:26:52] say in obedience to that Divine command
[1:26:56] I baptize you in the name of the Lord
[1:26:59] Jesus Christ they knew what that name
[1:27:02] was and there is not one place in
[1:27:05] scripture where they baptize any other
[1:27:07] way than in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:27:09] Christ Common Sense would tell you that
[1:27:12] the book of Acts is the church in action
[1:27:14] and if they baptize that way then that's
[1:27:17] the way to be baptized
[1:27:23] up until nasia the church always
[1:27:26] baptized in the name
[1:27:28] of the Lord Jesus Christ brother brother
[1:27:31] Brandon says right up until the truth
[1:27:32] was lost and did not return until this
[1:27:34] last age
[1:27:36] unto this last stage this is from nicaea
[1:27:38] to the turn of the century they baptized
[1:27:40] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he
[1:27:43] says but it has come back Satan can't
[1:27:48] keep the Revelation down when the spirit
[1:27:52] wants to give it I say you are rejoicing
[1:27:55] that tonight because I'm telling you
[1:27:57] that the spirit's here tonight trying to
[1:27:58] give some of you Revelation trying to
[1:28:00] get you to recognize some of you that
[1:28:02] hey Mama this is talking to me I want to
[1:28:04] be a part of that Kingdom and the
[1:28:06] spirits begin to move and he's trying to
[1:28:08] he's been working in your life and he's
[1:28:10] been calling you to a repentance been
[1:28:11] calling you back to the house of God and
[1:28:13] the devil's fighting it the devil's
[1:28:15] saying oh that's not who you are you're
[1:28:17] never going to be an overcomer you're
[1:28:19] never going to be delivered but I want
[1:28:20] to tell what a prophet said Satan can't
[1:28:23] keep the Revelation down when the spirit
[1:28:26] wants to give it so when the Lord's
[1:28:28] working in your life tonight I just say
[1:28:30] thank you Lord Jesus I'm going to accept
[1:28:31] it I don't care what the devil says he
[1:28:34] can't stop it he can't keep me bound
[1:28:36] there's a revelation tonight that says
[1:28:37] you're free there's a revelation a night
[1:28:39] that says you're an overcomer there's
[1:28:41] Revelation going forth tonight saying
[1:28:43] that you are a child of the Living God
[1:28:46] that hell wasn't created for you but
[1:28:48] heaven was created for you and the
[1:28:50] devil's saying it's not you it's not you
[1:28:52] it's not about you but revelation will
[1:28:55] not be kept down when the spirit wants
[1:28:58] to give it I just accept it tonight as
[1:29:00] mine and say Lord I know you're going to
[1:29:02] break through I know it's going to come
[1:29:03] into my heart because the devil cannot
[1:29:06] stop what God is going to do Hallelujah
[1:29:09] Acts 2 36 therefore let all the house of
[1:29:13] Israel know assuredly
[1:29:15] that God
[1:29:17] hath made that same Jesus whom you
[1:29:19] crucified both
[1:29:21] Lord
[1:29:23] and Christ
[1:29:27] he says there he is
[1:29:28] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:29:32] if Jesus is both Lord and Christ
[1:29:36] then he Jesus is and cannot be else but
[1:29:40] father
[1:29:42] Son and Holy Ghost in one person
[1:29:46] manifested in the flesh
[1:29:50] amen do you believe it tonight
[1:29:52] amen just a little bit further
[1:29:58] he says it is not God in three persons
[1:30:01] Blessed Trinity but one God one person
[1:30:04] with three major titles with three
[1:30:06] offices manifesting those titles hear it
[1:30:09] once more he says this same Jesus is
[1:30:12] both Lord and Christ Lord father Christ
[1:30:16] Holy Spirit our Jesus for he Jesus is
[1:30:20] both of them Lord and Christ he said if
[1:30:24] that doesn't show us the true revelation
[1:30:26] of the godhead nothing will Lord is not
[1:30:29] another one Christ is not another one
[1:30:32] this Jesus is the Lord Jesus Christ one
[1:30:37] God
[1:30:39] Hallelujah he says if Revelation is
[1:30:43] beyond you look up
[1:30:45] and seek God for it that is the only way
[1:30:49] you're ever going to get it
[1:30:51] if you feel like you just haven't been
[1:30:53] able to grasp it you feel like things
[1:30:54] are going over your head don't just go
[1:30:56] well I just don't understand he's saying
[1:30:58] if it's beyond you look up
[1:31:01] he says look up and and ask God for it
[1:31:04] seek God for it he says we need to call
[1:31:06] on God for Revelation more than anything
[1:31:09] else in the world he says it's not real
[1:31:14] to the majority of God's children that
[1:31:17] struck me
[1:31:18] it's not real what's that mean it's not
[1:31:21] that they don't believe it
[1:31:23] but it's not real it hasn't become
[1:31:26] revealed to them he says it's just a
[1:31:29] good verse in the Bible but we need to
[1:31:31] have it made alive to us and that will
[1:31:35] take Revelation listen I'm thankful for
[1:31:38] what Mama's done for me I'm thankful for
[1:31:40] what Daddy's done for me I'm thankful
[1:31:41] for the Christian homes and for what you
[1:31:43] have been taught but I'm saying tonight
[1:31:45] if Revelation is beyond you tonight is
[1:31:48] the night that he's calling you just to
[1:31:50] find out who do you say that I am he's
[1:31:53] calling you to know for yourself he's
[1:31:55] calling you to a revelation he's calling
[1:31:58] you to strive for he's calling you to
[1:32:00] seek for it he says we have accepted the
[1:32:03] Bible we have accepted the great truths
[1:32:05] of it but it's still not real to most
[1:32:07] people because the Revelation by the
[1:32:09] spirit is not there the word has not
[1:32:13] been quickened
[1:32:16] and I say maybe tonight before you came
[1:32:18] here you didn't understand I you know I
[1:32:21] didn't
[1:32:21] to the degree that I do now understand
[1:32:23] or realize the importance
[1:32:26] of seeking revelation
[1:32:29] but the prophet says seek more than
[1:32:31] anything else in the world right there
[1:32:36] that second one we need to call on God
[1:32:37] for Revelation more than anything else
[1:32:40] in the world why
[1:32:43] because a revelation given by the spirit
[1:32:45] can never be taken away from you by the
[1:32:48] arguments of man
[1:32:50] a revelation given by God can never be
[1:32:53] stripped away from you by man or the
[1:32:55] devil or by anything because once God
[1:32:57] gives it it's yours once he opened your
[1:33:00] eyes to something and reveals it to you
[1:33:02] it's yours forever First Corinthians 2
[1:33:05] 13 which things also we speak not in The
[1:33:08] Words which man's Wisdom teacheth
[1:33:11] but which the Holy Ghost teacheth
[1:33:13] comparing spiritual things
[1:33:15] with spiritual he says but we need the
[1:33:18] same spirit that gave it to teach it to
[1:33:20] us oh how we need Revelation by the
[1:33:23] spirit we don't need a new Bible we
[1:33:25] don't need a new translation though some
[1:33:27] are very good but I am not against them
[1:33:30] he says and I am not against them but we
[1:33:32] need the revelation of the spirit and
[1:33:34] thank God we can have what we need for
[1:33:37] God wants to reveal his word to us by
[1:33:40] his spirit I got a quote here saying God
[1:33:43] wants to reveal himself to you in a
[1:33:45] quote just while ago that said and when
[1:33:46] he wants to reveal it the devil can't
[1:33:48] keep it down so I believe that we're
[1:33:51] going to come out of this time and that
[1:33:53] in your life as you begin to progress
[1:33:54] and seek Revelation from God you are
[1:33:57] going to Blossom you are going to bloom
[1:33:59] and as you begin to recognize who you
[1:34:01] are and what you stand for and that you
[1:34:03] can do the Greater Works that you will
[1:34:05] become a part of an invincible Army that
[1:34:08] will do terrible damage to Satan's
[1:34:10] kingdom and that's why he's fighting it
[1:34:12] so much
[1:34:16] now we're bringing this down
[1:34:18] I have
[1:34:20] four slides left
[1:34:22] I want you to key in on this
[1:34:27] as I became more aware
[1:34:31] of the importance of recognizing the
[1:34:33] Supreme deity of Jesus Christ
[1:34:38] it's a perfect blood
[1:34:40] those of you who are struggling
[1:34:43] those of you who the enemy tells you're
[1:34:44] not going to overcome you're not going
[1:34:46] to make it but it's not for you that
[1:34:48] you're always going to fall back into
[1:34:49] temptation that you're always going to
[1:34:51] fall back in into your addictions you're
[1:34:53] always going to fall back into your
[1:34:54] failures that you're never going to be
[1:34:55] that you're never going to be because
[1:34:57] your problems are too big
[1:35:00] your depression your anxiety is too much
[1:35:02] you'll never be free from your
[1:35:04] nervousness I'm always going to have
[1:35:05] that I'm
[1:35:06] if you fall into any of those categories
[1:35:08] any doubts right now lock in
[1:35:12] Revelations 1 5.
[1:35:15] and from Jesus Christ who is the
[1:35:17] faithful Witness
[1:35:19] and the first begotten of the dead and
[1:35:21] the prince of the kings of the Earth
[1:35:23] unto him that loved us and washed us
[1:35:27] from our sins
[1:35:29] in his own
[1:35:33] blood
[1:35:34] now listen Revelation is of the utmost
[1:35:36] importance to you
[1:35:39] and the revelation of who he is
[1:35:41] especially as it relates to what he has
[1:35:44] done
[1:35:45] is huge
[1:35:47] especially as it relates to what he's
[1:35:49] done for you
[1:35:50] because the word washed here
[1:35:53] is actually loosed
[1:35:57] why does the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:35:59] as complete deity matter
[1:36:02] foreign
[1:36:03] it was his own blood that loosed us
[1:36:05] completely from our sins it was not
[1:36:08] human blood it was the blood of God
[1:36:11] Peter called it the blood of Christ
[1:36:15] it wasn't just some Prophet that died
[1:36:17] for you it wasn't some blood with
[1:36:19] limited power that it could overcome
[1:36:21] some things but it couldn't overcome
[1:36:23] pornography it couldn't overcome drugs
[1:36:25] it couldn't overcome family curses but
[1:36:27] it was a good man's blood it wasn't just
[1:36:30] a prophet it wasn't just a piece of the
[1:36:32] Trinity he was all of it this was the
[1:36:35] blood of Jesus Christ it was the blood
[1:36:38] of deity it was the blood of God it was
[1:36:41] the blood of the most perfect lamb and
[1:36:44] it was his blood that loosed you not
[1:36:47] just washed you but those chains that
[1:36:49] have held you those fear those anxiety
[1:36:52] those things that you're never going to
[1:36:53] be free from you'll always be fearful
[1:36:55] you'll always have anxiety he said no no
[1:36:57] no this is the blood of almighty God
[1:37:00] this is the blood of God it's greater
[1:37:02] than anxiety it's greater than drug
[1:37:04] addiction it's greater than family
[1:37:06] Cycles it's greater than your sins it's
[1:37:09] greater than the lion devil that said
[1:37:10] you ain't gonna make it because the
[1:37:12] spirit of God is here tonight and he's
[1:37:14] saying that's my blood that's my blood
[1:37:16] my blood is greater my blood is more
[1:37:19] powerful it is my blood that has loose
[1:37:22] you he says the omnipotent Jehovah God
[1:37:25] came down and made himself a body by
[1:37:28] means of the Virgin birth and indwelt it
[1:37:30] that it might be the blood of God that
[1:37:33] would free us loose us entirely from our
[1:37:36] sins and present us spotless before
[1:37:38] himself with exceeding great joy he goes
[1:37:40] on to say hallelujah God did not entrust
[1:37:43] his Plan of Salvation to to another he
[1:37:47] trusted only himself
[1:37:49] God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:37:51] and redeemed us to himself were saved by
[1:37:55] the blood of God the Eternal God and
[1:37:57] throughout the Mortal body in order to
[1:38:00] take away sin
[1:38:03] I'm talking to somebody tonight I'm
[1:38:05] talking to somebody tonight that thinks
[1:38:07] their sin is too great somebody that
[1:38:09] thinks they've gone too far somebody
[1:38:11] that has believed the LIE of the devil
[1:38:13] for too long you are saved by the blood
[1:38:16] of God this isn't just some Prophet this
[1:38:20] isn't just God sent a message I'm so
[1:38:22] thankful for that this message is Jesus
[1:38:24] Christ but right now I'm talking about
[1:38:25] his sacrifice at Calvary it was a
[1:38:28] perfect blood and it has loosed you
[1:38:30] whether you recognize it tonight you are
[1:38:32] free those chains are breaking off your
[1:38:35] life even as we speak because faith is
[1:38:37] coming by hearing and you're recognizing

[1:38:41] make it I am gonna be there I am going
[1:38:43] to Rapture it's a perfect blood for a
[1:38:46] perfect body for a perfect Rapture for a
[1:38:49] body change and it's calling out to you
[1:38:52] tonight

[1:39:01] God it's deity that is called out it
[1:39:03] took your place he says consider this
[1:39:06] since it is the blood of God it is
[1:39:08] perfect blood and if the perfect blood
[1:39:11] is loosing us from the power of bondage
[1:39:14] and defaming of sin then the loosing is
[1:39:17] perfect and complete I say be loose
[1:39:19] tonight I say be free tonight from
[1:39:22] whatever it is that's held you it's a
[1:39:24] perfect blood a perfect loosing there is

[1:39:57] the word you are loosed by the blood
[1:40:01] tonight Hallelujah
[1:40:03] he says don't be led astray by listening
[1:40:06] to those that deny the power of the word
[1:40:08] and deny that Jesus saves heals fills
[1:40:11] with the Holy Ghost and power you are
[1:40:14] God's free men loosed by his own blood
[1:40:17] if your free man stand your feet and

[1:40:21] know that I've been set free I've been
[1:40:23] loose oh I'm not going to listen to the
[1:40:25] devil I'm not going to listen to one
[1:40:27] that tells me I can't have it that I
[1:40:28] can't overcome that I got to stay bound
[1:40:30] he says you are God's free man I want to
[1:40:33] say it to you again you who you talking
[1:40:35] to not me yes you are God's free men
[1:40:40] Loose by his own blood
[1:40:43] Hallelujah I'm talking to you tonight oh
[1:40:47] to the lowest of Sinners to anyone in
[1:40:49] the building you may have been
[1:40:50] backslidden you may have been kept from
[1:40:53] your joy you may have been kept from
[1:40:54] your peace I'm just not what I ought to
[1:40:56] be you are God's free man
[1:40:59] he says in Galatians 5 1 Stand Fast
[1:41:02] therefore in the Liberty wherewith
[1:41:04] Christ hath made us free and be not
[1:41:07] entangled again with the Yoke of bondage
[1:41:09] I say walk out tonight
[1:41:11] walk out tonight you are God's free man
[1:41:14] and never again be entangled by that
[1:41:16] bondage never go back to it because the
[1:41:20] deity
[1:41:21] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:41:24] made it a perfect blood
[1:41:26] that loosed you
[1:41:28] that sets you free
[1:41:30] he closes this chapter by saying he's
[1:41:32] coming soon
[1:41:35] the alpha and Omega
[1:41:38] the prophet priest and King
[1:41:41] the all in all
[1:41:43] Lord God of host is coming soon
[1:41:47] even so Lord Jesus the one and only true
[1:41:52] God
[1:41:54] come quickly
[1:41:56] will you bow your heads with me for a
[1:41:57] moment
[1:42:07] sorry to have kept you as long as we
[1:42:09] have
[1:42:13] but I couldn't leave without getting to
[1:42:15] the perfect blood
[1:42:18] because I know I needed that perfect
[1:42:20] blood
[1:42:22] I set many as Services just like this as
[1:42:24] a young person as others labored and I
[1:42:26] sat there knowing I needed that perfect
[1:42:28] blood and yet that same spirit that
[1:42:30] would speak to brother Branham would
[1:42:31] tell me just wait a little longer
[1:42:33] just wait a little longer and in the
[1:42:36] waiting he does his damage
[1:42:39] and in the waiting he sows his seeds
[1:42:42] in the waiting he brings scars and in
[1:42:45] the waiting he brings more chains
[1:42:47] but in One Moment In The Presence of the
[1:42:49] perfect blood
[1:42:51] there can be a perfect loosing
[1:42:55] oh it's just a youth service brother
[1:42:57] Aaron it's just a Bible study
[1:42:59] it's just we're just going through the
[1:43:00] church age book that's right
[1:43:03] but if you need prayer tonight and you
[1:43:04] need to be loosed
[1:43:06] there's one in the building tonight
[1:43:09] he says I'm the one that created you
[1:43:11] I'm the one that died for you I'm the
[1:43:14] one that went to hell for you I rose
[1:43:16] again and sent my spirit back
[1:43:18] I'm the one that said in my name they
[1:43:21] shall cast out devils
[1:43:22] and he's calling you tonight
[1:43:24] and the devil is trying to keep that
[1:43:26] Revelation held down
[1:43:28] he's trying to keep it held down but
[1:43:29] right now the spirit's wanting to give
[1:43:31] it
[1:43:31] and when the spirit wants to give
[1:43:33] Revelation the devil can't stop it
[1:43:36] so if he's moving on your heart don't
[1:43:38] fight it
[1:43:39] if you want prayer tonight or you want
[1:43:40] to come new at this altar
[1:43:42] as we begin to worship for just a minute
[1:43:44] I want to give you that opportunity
[1:43:47] the desire of our heart in these studies
[1:43:49] is that we would have true revelation of
[1:43:51] what we read about and what we what we
[1:43:54] study and what we talk about not just a
[1:43:56] lesson
[1:43:57] I want you to draw closer to God
[1:44:00] I want all of us to draw closer to God I
[1:44:02] know that
[1:44:04] in the preparation for this it opened my
[1:44:06] eyes to many places where I needed to
[1:44:08] draw closer
[1:44:10] but right now I'll say it again if
[1:44:11] there's a devil lying to you and he's
[1:44:13] saying you can't be free I'm telling you
[1:44:15] the perfect blood is here to lose you
[1:44:17] from whatever the lies of the enemy are
[1:44:20] you can be free tonight you can be
[1:44:23] loosed
[1:44:24] Lord Jesus I just thank you Lord for the
[1:44:26] for the words of life for your for your
[1:44:30] perfect word Lord thank you that you
[1:44:32] came and took on flesh Lord I thank you
[1:44:35] that in this day it's been revealed to a
[1:44:36] prophetic class through a prophetic
[1:44:38] Ministry Lord I give you thanks that we
[1:44:41] can look into the scripture and see how
[1:44:42] it all lines up how it's all just
[1:44:44] perfect
[1:44:45] Lord I know I I can't teach it like many
[1:44:47] others can and I just pray tonight
[1:44:50] something will anchor in in the hearts
[1:44:51] of these young people and they'll see my
[1:44:53] God is one God
[1:44:55] my Lord Jesus is the all and all he's
[1:44:58] all of that he's the everything
[1:45:00] and Lord as the everything you're our
[1:45:02] savior you're our healer Lord you are
[1:45:05] the sole satisfier you are the deliverer
[1:45:07] right now Lord and you see the chains
[1:45:09] that would try to hold your people but
[1:45:11] tonight Lord I believe with all my heart
[1:45:14] that there is a perfect loosing
[1:45:16] available for your people because she
[1:45:18] will be without spot or wrinkle Lord
[1:45:20] this is the purchase of your blood and
[1:45:23] any hold that the enemy has tonight is
[1:45:25] unlawful
[1:45:26] Lord he has no rights he was stripped
[1:45:28] that day on Calvary and we speak freedom
[1:45:30] to the young people tonight
[1:45:32] I pray tonight that each one of them
[1:45:33] will recognize they don't have to stay
[1:45:35] they no longer have to be bound by fear
[1:45:37] no longer a Slave
[1:45:39] but Lord they may they be loosed in the
[1:45:41] name of the Lord Jesus
[1:45:43] Lord and just In This Moment In Your
[1:45:45] Presence as we take a moment I just pray
[1:45:46] that you'll continue to deal and speak
[1:45:49] and Lord that each one will have their
[1:45:50] opportunity that they walked in would
[1:45:52] change they don't have to leave with
[1:45:54] them but they can be free tonight in the
[1:45:56] name of Jesus thank you Lord once again
[1:45:58] for your for your presence and for the
[1:46:00] attention of these wonderful young
[1:46:01] people Lord as they labored with me and
[1:46:04] then was with me all the time I thank
[1:46:05] you for it Lord in Jesus name
[1:46:07] amen

[1:46:27] oh thank you Jesus
[1:46:32] He's Still the Lamb tonight
[1:46:34] [Music]
[1:46:37] I was a hopeless case
[1:46:39] but there was a perfect blood
[1:46:41] there was a loosing blood
[1:46:45] you know I don't talk about it much
