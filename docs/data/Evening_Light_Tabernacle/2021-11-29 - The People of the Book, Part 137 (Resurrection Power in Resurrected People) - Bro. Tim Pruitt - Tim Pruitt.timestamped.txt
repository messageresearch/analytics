[44:43] chapter 14 and verse 12 for our
[44:45] scripture reading this morning
[44:49] and as we
[44:51] as we read this you will notice that it
[44:53] speaks singular to he
[44:56] that believeth on me
[44:58] but brother branham tells us clearly in
[44:59] christ the mystery that it's just not
[45:02] one person is speaking to it's talking
[45:04] to the entire bride of jesus christ
[45:08] so verily verily i say unto you he that
[45:10] believeth on me the works that i do
[45:12] shall he do also and greater works than
[45:15] thee shall he do
[45:17] because i go to my father
[45:21] and whatsoever you shall ask in my name
[45:24] that i will do that the father may be
[45:26] glorified in the son
[45:29] if you ask anything in my name i will do
[45:32] it
[45:33] if you
[45:34] love me keep my commandments and i will
[45:36] pray the father and he shall give you
[45:38] another comforter
[45:40] that he may abide with you forever
[45:43] even the spirit of truth in the world
[45:45] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[45:47] neither knoweth him but ye know him
[45:51] for he dwelleth with you and shall
[45:54] be in you
[45:55] i will not leave you comfortless i will
[45:58] come to you
[45:59] yet a little while and the world seeth
[46:01] me no more but you see me because i live
[46:06] ye shall live also
[46:08] what wonderful words of life that is you
[46:10] can be seated

[47:09] amen so um you know i i i just as i
[47:13] reminisce for a moment
[47:15] going back uh maybe four or five years
[47:18] ago now
[47:19] i i met um a little
[47:22] little sister anderson
[47:24] down there and she said brother tim said
[47:26] i've been wanting to see you again said
[47:29] i i met you many many years ago back in
[47:32] the
[47:33] well it was in the 70s and
[47:35] said i wanted i want to share with you a
[47:38] testimony she was the the wife of a
[47:40] pastor and he's already gone on to be
[47:43] with the lord but she said i wonder i
[47:45] want to share with you a testimony he
[47:46] said i was
[47:48] i was a little girl
[47:50] and uh was only
[47:52] uh four
[47:53] years old four to five years old and um
[47:57] i uh had been taken to the doctors by my
[48:00] parents
[48:01] because um i
[48:03] i just
[48:05] you know didn't was very handicapped and
[48:08] and i did not have uh my my mind i just
[48:11] had very little brain function was
[48:14] severely
[48:16] and um she um she said that
[48:19] as uh when she went
[48:21] uh to the doctor the doctor told her
[48:23] said of course this was
[48:26] back in then they must have been the
[48:28] 1940s um late 40s that um you know where
[48:32] she uh was taken to the doctor and she
[48:35] said um
[48:36] um the doctor said you know there's no
[48:40] no hope medically there is absolutely no
[48:42] hope for for
[48:44] this little girl we can't do anything
[48:47] for her and you know there's many things
[48:49] that are still out of the reach of
[48:50] modern medicine
[48:52] right
[48:53] amen they they have no solution for it
[48:56] but anyway in this situation um
[48:59] they
[49:00] had
[49:01] told him that there was just really no
[49:03] hope medically
[49:04] so he the the doctor said
[49:08] um
[49:09] if i were you i would find somebody who
[49:12] believed in prayer
[49:14] and i would take her to
[49:17] what he said i would take her to
[49:19] some pentecostal somewhere
[49:22] and let them lay hands on her and pray
[49:24] for her
[49:25] and and um so
[49:28] the parents said well we are pentecostal
[49:31] and we we certainly will take our child
[49:34] for prayer well they heard over in the
[49:37] quincy louisiana which is
[49:39] kind of close to the where we had the
[49:41] youth camp down into ritter said down
[49:44] into quincy louisiana we have heard that
[49:47] that there is a prophet of god william
[49:49] branham who is um preaching meetings
[49:53] down there and holding divine healing
[49:55] services so they took the the little
[49:59] girl to the meetings and as they went
[50:02] there and they went through the prayer
[50:04] line and brother branham prayed for her
[50:07] and she was completely and totally
[50:09] healed the retardation gone restored
[50:12] completely and served as a pastor's wife
[50:16] for many years and you know god's still
[50:18] god
[50:19] and he's not just god of the past
[50:22] amen i brought you even to present tense
[50:24] to our age but listen it didn't die with
[50:27] the prophet of god
[50:29] amen when brother branham died jesus
[50:31] didn't die
[50:32] he died two thousand years ago and he
[50:34] rose again and come to show us and prove
[50:36] to us his resurrection power so god is
[50:40] still god and he is able to do exceeding
[50:43] abundantly above that which we're able
[50:45] to think or ask
[50:47] now let's go to romans chapter 8 and
[50:49] verse 11 as we
[50:51] look into the scripture romans 8 11 but
[50:54] if the spirit of him
[50:56] that raised up jesus from the dead dwell
[50:59] in you how many believe you have that
[51:01] spirit
[51:02] then he that raised up christ from the
[51:05] dead shall also quicken
[51:07] or make alive your mortal bodies by his
[51:10] spirit that dwelleth in you
[51:13] so we have a promise those of us who
[51:16] possess his holy spirit in our life that
[51:18] he will quicken
[51:20] our mortal bodies by his spirit
[51:24] and and of course there are many many
[51:27] quickenings of the spirit there will be
[51:29] quickenings from sin and to and to life
[51:32] there be quickening from sickness and to
[51:35] health there is quickening of course for
[51:38] the resurrection
[51:39] because i believe when you receive the
[51:41] holy ghost it is god's claim on your
[51:45] body for the resurrection
[51:47] now then i turn to philippians chapter 3
[51:50] and verse 7
[51:52] as we read this together but what things
[51:56] were gain
[51:57] to me i counted loss for christ
[52:01] yea doubtless and i count all things but
[52:04] lost for the excellency of the knowledge
[52:07] of christ jesus my lord for whom i've
[52:10] suffered the loss of all things and to
[52:12] count them but dung that i may win
[52:15] christ
[52:16] and be found in him not having mine own
[52:19] righteousness which is of the law but
[52:21] that which is through faith the faith of
[52:24] christ the righteousness which is of god
[52:27] by faith
[52:28] and then he says these notable words
[52:32] that i may know him
[52:36] and the power of his resurrection
[52:39] and the fellowship of his suffering
[52:41] being made conformable unto his death
[52:45] so today we're going to be speaking
[52:47] about resurrection power
[52:50] in a resurrected people
[52:52] now paul said these words that i
[52:55] might know him
[52:57] and
[52:58] he also said these words that if um the
[53:02] spirit that raised up jesus from the
[53:04] dead dwell in you he that raised christ
[53:06] from the dead shall also make alive your
[53:08] mortal bodies
[53:10] by the spirit that dwelleth in you
[53:12] and then jesus said these wonderful
[53:14] words that
[53:16] yet a little while the world will see me
[53:18] no more but you will see me
[53:21] because i live you live also
[53:25] so he promised that the church would
[53:27] continue to see him
[53:30] even though physically he wouldn't be
[53:32] with us
[53:33] but he would be with us in it by by the
[53:37] spirit of god not leaving us comfortless
[53:41] so
[53:41] as we
[53:43] as we know and speak and we walk in the
[53:47] resurrection power sin
[53:50] loses its hold on us
[53:52] and sickness and disease must leave
[53:55] resurrection power is the spirit of god
[53:58] it is the life of god
[54:01] and and we will not be
[54:04] defeated by anything in this life you
[54:07] need to you need to write that down we
[54:09] will not be defeated by anything in this
[54:13] life
[54:14] amen the resurrection of jesus shows us
[54:17] that the greatest power
[54:19] is god's power and nothing can overcome
[54:22] it
[54:23] and so as i speak today we know the
[54:27] world is rocking now with the news of a
[54:30] new baron of the covet viruses this
[54:32] gorgeous south african travel bans are
[54:35] put there and governments of the nations
[54:38] tried to stop it and our vaccines are
[54:41] now considered ineffected or at least
[54:44] thought ineffective
[54:45] and and more death is coming
[54:48] because we are on the eve of the
[54:50] tribulation we can already feel the hot
[54:53] winds blowing we see the clouds coming
[54:56] in
[54:57] we see darkness coming upon our nation
[54:59] upon our world and in our families
[55:02] remember you know it's it's like in
[55:05] revelation 9 where that where where that
[55:09] um that hell is opened up and the smoke
[55:13] from the from that place comes and and
[55:16] to the earth and blocks the light of the
[55:18] sun
[55:19] and we're we're seeing the darkness
[55:22] coming that is blocking the light of the
[55:24] son of god off of so many lives today
[55:28] all from our nation we just stopped for
[55:30] a moment for thanksgiving but i wonder i
[55:33] wonder how many real believers that
[55:36] there are even left in the world today
[55:39] you know people are giving you know a
[55:41] lip service to thanksgiving but really
[55:44] you know is there is a real reality
[55:47] where they can say that i know him
[55:51] that i know him that i have experienced
[55:53] him that i i know who he is
[55:57] i've made it myself
[56:00] but here we are it's on the eve of
[56:02] tribulation and as i said the smoke
[56:05] permeating like smoke does it's it it it
[56:09] saturates every fiber of humanity it
[56:13] gets into every crack in and corner of
[56:15] humanity it's in our schools it's in our
[56:18] colleges it's in the fabric of of home
[56:21] life it's everywhere that it's getting
[56:23] in there and i'll tell you what as that
[56:25] death angel comes in you gotta have a
[56:28] token the holy ghost it must be applied
[56:31] to your life and this cannot be just as
[56:34] a cliche that we use i've got to talk
[56:36] and you must possess
[56:38] the holy ghost in your life and apply
[56:41] them in every situation
[56:46] plague's coming
[56:47] modern science will curse
[56:50] and they'll curse god
[56:53] because there's nothing
[56:55] they can do
[56:59] now paul says that i might know him
[57:03] it's a very important thing
[57:06] especially in this hour it was imported
[57:09] in every hour but now we're coming down
[57:12] to the end
[57:14] not merely know about him
[57:18] but to know him in the power of his
[57:20] resurrection
[57:22] when when a person is healed that's the
[57:25] power of the resurrection
[57:28] when a
[57:29] person is saved that is resurrection
[57:31] power at work
[57:33] and that's what this church must have in
[57:36] this hour
[57:37] because
[57:38] not only did jesus need a resurrection
[57:41] to prove his claims just think of it he
[57:43] said i
[57:45] lay my life down and i'll raise it up
[57:47] again
[57:48] destroy this temple i'll raise it up in
[57:51] three days
[57:52] you know he made claims
[57:54] but had he not raised and all of his
[57:57] claims would have proved how falsely he
[58:00] was
[58:01] amen so he had to have the resurrection
[58:05] to prove that he was really the lord
[58:08] over the dead
[58:09] the lord over hell
[58:12] the lord over the
[58:14] amen
[58:15] every demon power that there was because
[58:18] he had to prove he was truly lord ruler
[58:24] and the resurrection
[58:26] proved his claims
[58:29] but you know it's not just jesus that
[58:31] needs a resurrection
[58:33] the church needs the resurrection
[58:36] you see as brother branham said it in
[58:39] the easter seal and see in the hour that
[58:42] we're living in we need an easter
[58:44] egg in the church
[58:46] resurrection we need a resurrection
[58:50] listen now to power faith
[58:53] a resurrection to power faith
[58:57] notice amen men and women to stand out
[59:01] for what god for that which is god's
[59:04] vindicated word
[59:06] so we need a resurrection to power faith
[59:09] because for far too many faith is dead
[59:14] so how do you know it's dead what faith
[59:15] without works
[59:18] is dead
[59:19] and the works have ceased
[59:22] with too many
[59:24] amen when they should be doing the works
[59:26] of jesus the works have ceased
[59:30] amen so their faith is dead
[59:33] and it is but it is not a time to be
[59:36] faithless
[59:37] this hour calls for resurrection and
[59:40] rapture in faith
[59:42] brother branham said in the evening
[59:44] messenger he said bring back the church
[59:47] to the word now what is this messenger
[59:49] of malachi for to do restore back the
[59:52] original faith the resurrection faith
[59:56] amen that they see jesus after he was
[59:59] raised from the dead seen him working
[1:00:01] among them it must restore resurrection
[1:00:05] faith
[1:00:06] you see as i said it's a time of great
[1:00:09] trouble upon the earth
[1:00:11] it's a time of diseases and viruses that
[1:00:14] mutate and come again and again it's the
[1:00:17] scourge of the world and it's
[1:00:20] unstoppable and uncontrollable
[1:00:23] you get one vaccine you got to have
[1:00:25] another you get that one you got to have
[1:00:27] another booster and you get that one and
[1:00:28] they want another booster and and
[1:00:31] because it's unstoppable and
[1:00:33] uncontrollable new ones now coming that
[1:00:36] vaccines have no defense against
[1:00:42] so you can see
[1:00:44] already the winds and and you can tell
[1:00:47] the signs of the oncoming judgment
[1:00:50] we are closer than we've ever been
[1:00:54] but i want to just remind you there's
[1:00:56] something else that is coming
[1:01:00] hallelujah
[1:01:01] amen is something else that is coming
[1:01:04] besides besides tribulation and viruses
[1:01:08] and and and terrible diseases and
[1:01:11] plagues there's something else that is
[1:01:13] coming
[1:01:14] as brother adam would say in the token
[1:01:17] i'm looking for a time of a break forth
[1:01:20] of the spirit of god in these last days
[1:01:23] that we're now in it for another surge
[1:01:26] of the holy spirit into the church for a
[1:01:29] rapture and faith just before it comes
[1:01:33] hallelujah amen so not only can we feel
[1:01:36] that wind blowing but there's another
[1:01:39] wind blowing i can feel a bit of mighty
[1:01:42] wind blowing amen and it's moving
[1:01:46] through our lives it's turning our lives
[1:01:48] and our hearts around everything
[1:01:50] somebody rushing well
[1:01:52] as he pours out his spirit upon his
[1:01:55] church
[1:01:55] [Applause]
[1:02:02] and i believe we're now at the time that
[1:02:04] the word should have preeminence
[1:02:07] i believe it's time to lay aside our
[1:02:09] creeds and our thoughts
[1:02:12] and come back to the word
[1:02:16] come back to the word
[1:02:19] not to a dead creed
[1:02:22] but a word with resurrection power
[1:02:25] with anointing with life
[1:02:28] amen something that is more than
[1:02:30] mechanics
[1:02:34] mechanics brother branham said doesn't
[1:02:36] run the automobile it's the dynamic that
[1:02:39] runs it
[1:02:40] mechanics don't run the church it's the
[1:02:42] dynamics
[1:02:44] the holy ghost gets into that that gets
[1:02:46] into this word is not a seminary
[1:02:49] oh god i think of how you know for you
[1:02:52] for now it seemed like almost 50 years
[1:02:55] we have educated ourselves
[1:02:59] into the message we have made seminary
[1:03:02] and lectures and
[1:03:03] ministers instead of being preachers
[1:03:07] you know what makes a preacher signs
[1:03:08] following
[1:03:10] when you preach amen he demonstrates the
[1:03:13] power of god and we have become
[1:03:15] lecturers
[1:03:18] educated in the message
[1:03:21] are you with me amen discerning all our
[1:03:24] theology and greek interpretation but he
[1:03:26] said it's the dynamics of the holy ghost
[1:03:29] and there to set that of fire and bring
[1:03:32] it to pass and to make it live just
[1:03:35] exactly what the word promised for is
[1:03:38] for this hour not the mechanics the
[1:03:40] dynamics
[1:03:42] it takes the mechanics and dynamics the
[1:03:45] word and the spirit they are the one
[1:03:48] that gives life
[1:03:51] can be one without the other
[1:03:54] it seemed like we went down through
[1:03:55] times you know where
[1:03:57] it's like clipping the wings of a
[1:03:59] chicken you clip one wing and he just
[1:04:01] flops around he can never get over the
[1:04:03] fence
[1:04:07] so we'll clip off
[1:04:09] the dynamics
[1:04:11] and favor the mechanics
[1:04:13] or we'll clip off the mechanics
[1:04:16] and favor the dynamics
[1:04:20] it takes both
[1:04:22] it takes both spirit and in truth
[1:04:26] it takes a balanced walk
[1:04:28] one can't be out of balance are you with
[1:04:30] me
[1:04:31] amen you can't just get on the emotional
[1:04:34] side and there's no life to go with it
[1:04:38] amen you can't just get over on the word
[1:04:40] word word side and there's there's no
[1:04:42] joy there's no emotion there's no no no
[1:04:45] enthusiasm there's no
[1:04:47] come on somebody hey man you know what
[1:04:50] i'm talking about
[1:04:51] i'm talking about
[1:04:52] dynamics and i'm talking about what
[1:04:55] brother branham talked about the
[1:04:56] stimulation of revelation
[1:04:59] we get so revelated we call it but our
[1:05:01] wine ain't got any stimulation in it
[1:05:06] amen he's done lost his fears
[1:05:10] lost to juice
[1:05:17] what we have ought to make us happy it
[1:05:19] ought to make us rejoice
[1:05:21] in ought to make you want to shout
[1:05:23] hey man you say brother tim but you know
[1:05:26] where we're studious with our with our
[1:05:28] horn and glasses on and we we've got it
[1:05:30] all down and you know we're we're
[1:05:33] we're nerdy message believers
[1:05:45] and the word laying there without life
[1:05:47] in it
[1:05:52] now i want to just remind you
[1:05:54] that this end time requires more of the
[1:05:56] holy ghost not less
[1:06:00] amen the dynamic the dynamics of this
[1:06:03] church brother brandon said will be a
[1:06:05] refilling of the holy ghost
[1:06:07] that we have worked in a small measure
[1:06:08] while the headstone is coming down to
[1:06:10] unite with the body but when that head
[1:06:12] and body unites together the full power
[1:06:15] of the holy ghost would raise her up
[1:06:18] just exactly like that even the dead
[1:06:20] that's dead in christ for hundreds of
[1:06:22] years will rise in the beauty of his
[1:06:25] holiness and take a flight to disguise
[1:06:28] the dynamics is the holy spirit
[1:06:32] again brother bradham talks about this
[1:06:34] and world falling apart
[1:06:37] that he spoke right here in shreveport i
[1:06:39] more than likely was there i was a
[1:06:41] little bit younger then and don't
[1:06:42] remember particular this service but
[1:06:44] nevertheless you know it it's his
[1:06:47] promise for this hour
[1:06:49] we look in the bible we see it
[1:06:51] everywhere through the bible anointed
[1:06:53] ones come
[1:06:55] and make that word live again
[1:06:58] let's stop just for a moment anointed
[1:07:00] one said well brother tim we don't want
[1:07:01] to be these anointed ones at the end
[1:07:03] time yes we do
[1:07:06] yes we do
[1:07:08] the anointings never sent
[1:07:11] for the terror
[1:07:13] they just happen to be in the same field
[1:07:17] and because they're shouting we can't
[1:07:19] shout
[1:07:20] because they're rejoicing
[1:07:22] and get moisturized by the rain we can't
[1:07:25] rejoice
[1:07:26] what do you mean it was for us
[1:07:29] the rain was not set for the unbeliever
[1:07:32] it was not sent for the tares the raid
[1:07:35] was sent for the wheat
[1:07:38] and it ought to make the wheat raise
[1:07:40] their hands up and say hallelujah thank
[1:07:43] you jesus
[1:07:47] this is what happened when the seals
[1:07:48] were opened to john
[1:07:50] he didn't sit there with his horn round
[1:07:52] glasses on and say i've got more
[1:07:54] understanding now than you do and then
[1:07:56] something more to argue about and fuss
[1:07:58] about and fuss with remember what was it
[1:08:01] he said when i saw the lamb had taken my
[1:08:05] place and brother paid my debt and
[1:08:08] opened the book i couldn't take hey man
[1:08:11] it was an intercessor for me everything
[1:08:14] heard me shouting praising god
[1:08:17] [Applause]
[1:08:20] it ought to make you want to shout
[1:08:25] anointed ones come on and make that word
[1:08:28] live again
[1:08:29] right
[1:08:30] in the hour for that hour
[1:08:33] and we've got the messiah
[1:08:36] this is him the word
[1:08:38] in the beginning was the word the lord
[1:08:40] was with god the word was god and the
[1:08:43] word remains god hebrews 13 8 the same
[1:08:46] yesterday today and forever we know
[1:08:48] what's supposed to take place in this
[1:08:50] day
[1:08:51] we're wanting a messiah
[1:08:54] and god gave us the messiah his promised
[1:08:57] word to anoint it and to make it live
[1:08:59] again
[1:09:00] yes sir real messiah it's the word of
[1:09:04] god and both heavens and earth will pass
[1:09:07] away
[1:09:08] but my word shall never pass away said
[1:09:10] jesus
[1:09:11] so what is the word waiting for
[1:09:15] he said it's waiting for somebody
[1:09:18] i don't believe that's just one person
[1:09:21] don't try to make another messiah
[1:09:24] don't make her your favorite preacher
[1:09:26] the messiah that's going to do it
[1:09:29] you know we've we've already had the
[1:09:31] apostle and we've already had the
[1:09:33] teacher and we've all had all of these
[1:09:36] and these are all greater than even the
[1:09:38] prophet god sent
[1:09:39] and they made messiahs at them and had
[1:09:41] their little camps and their little
[1:09:43] groups that followed and rallied around
[1:09:45] their messiah
[1:09:46] and what it bring another little
[1:09:48] denomination
[1:09:50] amen another death camp
[1:09:53] are you with me
[1:09:55] amen
[1:09:56] but but let me tell you something here
[1:09:58] the word is waiting for somebody
[1:10:01] can we be one of those somebodies
[1:10:04] amen somebody with faith to anoint it
[1:10:08] and to make it live again
[1:10:11] hallelujah
[1:10:13] now
[1:10:14] again three kinds of believers
[1:10:17] and i read this quote last sunday
[1:10:20] and i'm not having to mention i know
[1:10:21] what i did
[1:10:23] but the reason i believe that when the
[1:10:26] bride is called out and elected and said
[1:10:28] in the book of life there will come a
[1:10:30] sound from heaven that it takes such a
[1:10:33] baptism of the holy spirit into that
[1:10:35] bride that had taken from the earth in a
[1:10:38] rapture and grace god promised it
[1:10:41] now
[1:10:43] a sound
[1:10:44] from heaven
[1:10:46] that it takes such a baptism of the holy
[1:10:48] spirit into that bride
[1:10:53] then that should be
[1:10:56] the inoculation we're looking for
[1:11:00] not from some
[1:11:02] something by j and j or something from
[1:11:05] pfizer or whoever else
[1:11:08] remember the real inoculation
[1:11:12] amen that'll inoculate to you from
[1:11:14] unbelief that's sin
[1:11:16] that's a lot worse disease than coveted
[1:11:20] are you with me
[1:11:21] amen but now brother branham tells us
[1:11:24] it's the same holy spirit that saved the
[1:11:27] lutherans now they were justified
[1:11:30] you know that sanctified the methodists
[1:11:33] that baptized the pentecostals
[1:11:36] is sitting in order the coming of the
[1:11:39] lord jesus when it will be so powerful
[1:11:43] that that body will that body will come
[1:11:46] into this group of church that would
[1:11:48] draw the rest of them from the grave
[1:11:51] there will be a resurrection
[1:11:54] what the holy ghost is for
[1:11:56] hallelujah that's why we need him in
[1:11:59] this hour to be so powerful
[1:12:02] amen that that it will come in this
[1:12:04] group of church that would draw the rest
[1:12:07] of them
[1:12:08] hallelujah can you imagine something
[1:12:10] that comes so powerful in the living
[1:12:14] those that are alive and remain it'll
[1:12:16] draw the rest of them
[1:12:19] from the grave
[1:12:23] hallelujah
[1:12:25] a people then with resurrection life
[1:12:28] with a resurrection power in them
[1:12:31] question answers on the holy ghost jesus
[1:12:33] said say to this mountain you've heard
[1:12:34] about what's been taking place that's
[1:12:37] the ministry we're entering into
[1:12:40] we're way up the road now soon to come
[1:12:42] into the lord jesus and we've got to
[1:12:44] have rapture and faith in that church
[1:12:46] that can be changed in a moment a
[1:12:48] twinkling of an eye to go out or will
[1:12:50] not go
[1:12:51] but don't worry
[1:12:53] oh i love this it'll be there
[1:12:57] hallelujah don't worry
[1:12:59] it'll be there
[1:13:01] amen and when the power of this church
[1:13:05] rises
[1:13:06] it'll bring its brethren and the power
[1:13:09] of that church rises will bring its
[1:13:13] brethren and the power of that church
[1:13:15] will bring the other brethren and
[1:13:17] there'll be a general resurrection
[1:13:21] hallelujah
[1:13:22] the power in this church rising
[1:13:25] don't look for less power
[1:13:28] look for more power
[1:13:30] resurrection power
[1:13:32] hallelujah
[1:13:33] amen now in the message paragraphs
[1:13:36] brother branham said for me to live is
[1:13:38] christ hallelujah i believe the same god
[1:13:41] that fell on the day of pentecost upon
[1:13:43] his church
[1:13:44] as a pillar of fire divided himself with
[1:13:47] cloven tongues among his people is here
[1:13:50] tonight it's the same god and he was
[1:13:53] then he is today with the same holy
[1:13:55] ghost i know it's a paradox it cannot be
[1:13:58] explained emotions screaming crying and
[1:14:01] so forth cannot be explained but it is a
[1:14:04] paradox how god does it it's the unseen
[1:14:08] god dwelling in the human heart making
[1:14:11] himself visible by vindicating his word
[1:14:14] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:14:16] forever
[1:14:18] hallelujah
[1:14:19] now what wonderful words are that
[1:14:22] look at what's promised
[1:14:24] look at what is happening
[1:14:27] because i can just tell you it's not
[1:14:29] something
[1:14:30] that is in the future amen it's
[1:14:32] something that's already present
[1:14:36] hallelujah i mean come on we look over
[1:14:38] here and we can see the plagues coming
[1:14:40] and when you see some of them already
[1:14:42] present
[1:14:44] pre-tribulation plagues coming up on the
[1:14:46] earth can't you see all of that well
[1:14:48] then what about the believers they ought
[1:14:50] to be able to see more than the demon
[1:14:53] powers that are spreading out
[1:14:56] they ought to see the life of life
[1:14:59] amen is here among us
[1:15:01] jesus christ who is alive who's not dead
[1:15:05] but alive
[1:15:15] i love this quote here
[1:15:18] because brother branham speaks about it
[1:15:19] in god's covenant with abraham and his
[1:15:21] seed
[1:15:22] he said jesus constantly was fear not
[1:15:26] fear not
[1:15:28] remember we've been reading revelation
[1:15:29] chapter 1 for the last couple of
[1:15:31] services i didn't read it this morning
[1:15:33] but i'm still preaching on it
[1:15:35] fooled you didn't i
[1:15:38] fear not that was the words that he said
[1:15:40] to john
[1:15:42] fear not
[1:15:44] amen
[1:15:45] i like what he said in the church age
[1:15:46] book he said i have not come to bring
[1:15:49] you
[1:15:50] i have not come to bring you fear and
[1:15:52] failure
[1:15:54] but i have come to bring you love and
[1:15:56] courage and ability
[1:15:59] hallelujah fear not i am with you always
[1:16:02] to the end of the world didn't we just
[1:16:03] read that i will not leave you
[1:16:05] comfortless i will come to you
[1:16:08] fear not and the christian keeps sitting
[1:16:10] back oh i just wonder
[1:16:14] oh my he said turn loose
[1:16:18] get all the things away from you and say
[1:16:20] mr satan you are defeated
[1:16:25] jesus christ stripped you of every power
[1:16:27] you had when he died at calvary and
[1:16:29] you're nothing but a bluff
[1:16:32] and you can't bluff me
[1:16:35] amen i'm made out of that stuff that
[1:16:37] don't bluff
[1:16:39] that's what come from calvary hallelujah
[1:16:42] don't bluff it go receive it
[1:16:45] amen how many can say this morning
[1:16:47] you've been made out of stuff
[1:16:49] that won't bluff
[1:16:51] you've received a word you've received a
[1:16:53] promise you've received an experience
[1:16:56] you've received the indwelling christ
[1:16:58] you know him and because you know him
[1:17:04] because he's appeared to you
[1:17:07] hallelujah don't you know church we're
[1:17:10] right here in the emmaus walk again
[1:17:13] and he's walking among his church even
[1:17:15] now
[1:17:16] jesus christ showing himself the same
[1:17:19] yesterday today and
[1:17:20] don't you know the emmaus walk is going
[1:17:24] on
[1:17:25] and he's walking along with you and he's
[1:17:27] expounding the scriptures and he says
[1:17:29] but that was me there in moses and that
[1:17:32] was me back there in elijah and that was
[1:17:35] me back there in jeremiah and that was
[1:17:37] me are you with me amen that was me all
[1:17:41] the way down through that was me i was
[1:17:43] there and he opens up the scripture and
[1:17:46] opens up their understanding and makes
[1:17:48] them know i've never left you i'm right
[1:17:50] here i'm not dead i'm the risen christ
[1:17:54] hallelujah i'm the same yesterday today
[1:17:57] or forever amen i won't fail i didn't
[1:18:00] fail back deal i won't tell you now
[1:18:03] amen it's similar swap where he's
[1:18:06] revealing himself
[1:18:08] stepping out of your shadows walking
[1:18:11] down along with you and showing you he's
[1:18:13] christ the same
[1:18:21] why
[1:18:22] he got to have a people in this day
[1:18:24] that's made out of different stuff
[1:18:27] stuff
[1:18:28] that won't bluff
[1:18:35] but oh
[1:18:38] there is a church that is bluffing
[1:18:42] they pretend to be the bride of christ
[1:18:46] remember that's how the antichrist
[1:18:48] started his ride
[1:18:50] he was on
[1:18:52] a white horse pretending
[1:18:56] pretending impersonating christ
[1:19:00] i think today you know there's a lot of
[1:19:01] pretension going on you don't we'll
[1:19:03] pretend he comes down when we push play
[1:19:06] and we pretend we turn the ministry or
[1:19:09] the the message over to brother branham
[1:19:11] and we pretend that he's serving us
[1:19:13] communion and we put prayer close in
[1:19:15] front of the of the speakers and we
[1:19:17] pretend that he's praying over the
[1:19:19] prayer class
[1:19:22] and we turned the whole thing into
[1:19:23] pretension
[1:19:27] too many are just pretending to be
[1:19:29] christians
[1:19:31] pretending to really believe
[1:19:37] and they're bluffing that's why the
[1:19:39] antichrist come out he come out with a
[1:19:41] blow and no arrows
[1:19:44] he had a claim
[1:19:46] you know
[1:19:47] and he had a profession
[1:19:49] but he had nothing to go with it
[1:19:52] as he said in the first seal he's a
[1:19:55] bluff he has no power you say the power
[1:19:58] of the church he said where's it at
[1:20:01] i'm just quoting your prophet
[1:20:03] what do they do we're the original
[1:20:05] church
[1:20:07] the original church cast out devils
[1:20:10] it healed the sick
[1:20:12] it raised the dead it saw visions and
[1:20:14] everything else words of that now see
[1:20:17] he's a bluff a bow with no arrow and
[1:20:20] that's exactly the pretentious that that
[1:20:22] we we've come down to around the message
[1:20:27] we're presenting a christ
[1:20:29] who has no arrows
[1:20:32] he did it 50 years ago he did it in the
[1:20:34] past but he don't do that today you see
[1:20:37] that was only for his ministry john 14
[1:20:40] 12 was only for william branham
[1:20:42] you see um you know we're not to have
[1:20:45] divine healings we we shouldn't have
[1:20:47] prayer lines there shouldn't even be
[1:20:49] altar calls anymore
[1:20:53] you see what is it we we want to we're
[1:20:56] presenting a christ
[1:20:58] that has a bow but no arrow
[1:21:01] and that's not jesus
[1:21:04] that's the antichrist
[1:21:06] amen because the real jesus don't just
[1:21:09] have a bow come on
[1:21:11] hallelujah there's a sword comes out of
[1:21:14] his mouth
[1:21:15] when he speaks demons flee amen when he
[1:21:18] uses the word amen there are healings
[1:21:21] there are deliverance there's salvation
[1:21:32] in the rising of the sun
[1:21:34] brother bradham tells us the very
[1:21:36] message of the gospel itself
[1:21:39] and let me remind you about the gospel i
[1:21:42] want you to remember about the gospel
[1:21:43] just for a moment let me deviate just a
[1:21:45] second
[1:21:47] because
[1:21:48] it is only until this age that we've
[1:21:51] come back to the pure gospel of
[1:21:54] christ jesus said this gospel
[1:22:00] not the methodist gospel the
[1:22:01] presbyterian gospel and
[1:22:05] but this gospel
[1:22:08] must be preached preaching all the world
[1:22:10] and then the end shall come
[1:22:14] now the message of the gospel then
[1:22:18] has not returned until this day when god
[1:22:20] turned us back to the original faith
[1:22:24] well we got things that old paul didn't
[1:22:27] have you better not
[1:22:30] certainly we understand the symbols in
[1:22:31] the book of revelation the book of
[1:22:33] revelation wasn't written until paul
[1:22:34] left
[1:22:36] after he was gone then the book of
[1:22:38] revelation was written
[1:22:40] paul didn't know the book of revelation
[1:22:41] he didn't need to know it it wasn't
[1:22:43] sealed to him the book was not sealed to
[1:22:45] him it was the antichrist spirit to come
[1:22:48] forth to begin to close the book on the
[1:22:51] promises and on the truths of the word
[1:22:54] and begin to seal it up
[1:22:57] amen but you see it's in this day
[1:22:59] there's been a clearing of the deed
[1:23:03] hallelujah amen in the debts and the
[1:23:05] liens that was against us a false
[1:23:07] doctrine has been lifted off the church
[1:23:10] amen
[1:23:11] that's why we can take a rapture luther
[1:23:14] couldn't take a rapture because you see
[1:23:16] the accuser could say but you got my
[1:23:18] baptism a trinitarian baptism but you've
[1:23:21] still got my catechism you see wesley
[1:23:24] couldn't take a rapture same thing come
[1:23:26] on zoos the street couldn't take a
[1:23:28] rapture the same thing but you're living
[1:23:30] in a day and hour where the lamb has
[1:23:32] taken the book and he's loosed the seals
[1:23:35] and he's opened up the title deed of
[1:23:37] redemption
[1:23:39] to make you the people of the book
[1:23:45] this is your
[1:23:46] land and in this land here it's defining
[1:23:50] here this is the land this is our
[1:23:52] borders from genesis to revelation
[1:23:56] amen
[1:23:57] do you know that's from eden to eden
[1:24:02] if you ever looked at it do you realize
[1:24:04] that it starts out with eden and it ends
[1:24:07] with eden
[1:24:08] and i john saw the new jerusalem coming
[1:24:11] down from god out of heaven
[1:24:13] amen he will bring heaven back down on
[1:24:16] the earth and god again will dwell with
[1:24:18] his people and walk with man again come
[1:24:20] on somebody
[1:24:22] amen everything in between is a story of
[1:24:24] redemption but brother we can look with
[1:24:27] our eyes set on the end
[1:24:30] hallelujah there's coming a day where
[1:24:32] heaven will come back down upon earth
[1:24:36] it was lifted back when sin entered into
[1:24:39] eden and god said you can't live here
[1:24:41] and he closed eden's gates
[1:24:43] and the entrance to there was forbidden
[1:24:45] to man but we're coming back to his
[1:24:48] entrance again
[1:24:56] hallelujah
[1:24:58] makes me want to shout
[1:25:00] hallelujah
[1:25:02] thank you jesus
[1:25:04] amen your plan of redemption
[1:25:06] the very message of the gospel itself is
[1:25:08] to prove to the people that he's risen
[1:25:13] go tell my disciples i'm risen from the
[1:25:16] dead i'll meet with them to confirm this
[1:25:18] to them oh god how in this last day
[1:25:22] there shall be light again across the
[1:25:24] earth and i'll prove
[1:25:26] to my disciples go tell them i'm not
[1:25:29] dead i'm not a tradition i'm a living
[1:25:32] christ i'll meet them take this message
[1:25:35] to my disciples that i'm risen from the
[1:25:38] dead
[1:25:39] that's our message today
[1:25:43] they tried to seal him in a baptist tomb
[1:25:46] in a methodist tomb in a pentecostal
[1:25:49] tomb remember the seals were broken off
[1:25:51] of it come on somebody and then he
[1:25:54] raised their showing he's christ alive
[1:25:57] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:26:01] that's the good news of the gospel
[1:26:03] that's what's going to be preached
[1:26:06] you say is that right hebrews 13 8 said
[1:26:09] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:26:11] forever we his beneficiaries
[1:26:14] are to prove his life is in us
[1:26:19] [Music]
[1:26:20] now the beneficiaries of this life
[1:26:22] notice we
[1:26:24] are to prove
[1:26:25] his life
[1:26:27] is in us
[1:26:29] the life there was never a life like it
[1:26:32] lived like it he was the son of god and
[1:26:35] he died
[1:26:36] and that shut it out
[1:26:38] but when he raised again from the dead
[1:26:40] on easter morning then we as his
[1:26:43] servants are commissioned by him to go
[1:26:45] into all the world and bring this good
[1:26:48] news to every person that he's a living
[1:26:51] and how can we do it by word only see
[1:26:54] that's what we've tried to do
[1:26:58] too much of our mission work has been
[1:27:00] just
[1:27:02] changing their philosophy showing them
[1:27:05] you know some mysteries that's been
[1:27:06] revealed and then go baptize them in the
[1:27:09] name of jesus christ that's a good step
[1:27:13] it'll get you as far as the tribulation
[1:27:20] are you with me
[1:27:22] amen you've got to have the token to get
[1:27:23] out of here
[1:27:26] the holy ghost must come
[1:27:28] amen it it is more than just believing
[1:27:31] the message that is baptist theology
[1:27:35] we have treated you you know we we have
[1:27:37] been so afraid of pentecost and they're
[1:27:41] pushing you to some gift or tongues or
[1:27:43] or emotion or whatever else until we
[1:27:45] went all the way the other way until we
[1:27:47] become baptists
[1:27:49] [Applause]
[1:27:52] lutherans just say i believe jesus my
[1:27:54] savior okay you're saved
[1:27:57] we believe when you
[1:27:59] in the words of joel osteen we believe
[1:28:01] when you prayed that simple prayer lord

[1:28:06] sins i accept you as lord and my savior
[1:28:09] okay now everybody clap your hands
[1:28:11] because
[1:28:15] we believe when you did that you were
[1:28:16] born again
[1:28:18] he wasn't born again
[1:28:22] that's not the new birth
[1:28:25] that that that is that is just the first
[1:28:28] stages of justification
[1:28:31] where you confess that he's your lord
[1:28:33] and you confess and ask forgiveness of
[1:28:36] sin that's justification
[1:28:38] you ain't incentified
[1:28:40] amen you got a lot of them justified
[1:28:42] people that are still smoking drinking

[1:29:54] that's a filthy spirit
[1:29:56] not the holy spirit amen
[1:29:59] amen let me repeat it again god does not
[1:30:02] come to save you
[1:30:04] in your sins but from your sins
[1:30:15] now that makes people uncomfortable
[1:30:17] it needs to
[1:30:19] what are you going to do when we stand
[1:30:21] there at rapture day
[1:30:23] and you're left behind
[1:30:25] amen
[1:30:27] you don't have a ticket
[1:30:29] a token
[1:30:31] and some preacher has preached you happy
[1:30:35] satisfied
[1:30:37] just to warm up you of a message church
[1:30:39] and you belong to the clique and the
[1:30:40] clown and you can recite the creeds and
[1:30:43] says well i believe this and i believe
[1:30:45] that i believe god sent a prophet so
[1:30:46] does the devil he knows it
[1:30:49] so i believe god is one well the devil
[1:30:51] does too and he trembles
[1:30:54] amen you don't have to convince the
[1:30:56] devil of serpent seed he's the one that
[1:30:58] did it
[1:31:02] come on
[1:31:03] amen well you know you you
[1:31:06] hey you got there you've got as far as
[1:31:07] the devil gets
[1:31:10] go a little further
[1:31:11] get sanctified get them more habits out
[1:31:14] let's see them be burned out of your
[1:31:16] life be filled with the spirit
[1:31:18] hallelujah
[1:31:19] [Applause]
[1:31:25] how can we do it by word only
[1:31:29] for it's written the gospel came not by
[1:31:31] word only but through the power and the
[1:31:33] manifestation of the holy spirit to
[1:31:35] prove that he's alive
[1:31:40] you see what we have today is another
[1:31:42] gospel
[1:31:45] jesus or actually paul would be the one
[1:31:48] to say
[1:31:49] that there would be one who would come
[1:31:50] that would so impersonate christ
[1:31:53] that he would sit in the temple of god
[1:31:55] and proclaim himself as he was as if he
[1:31:57] was god
[1:32:01] and so you see in the beginning god
[1:32:03] created man in the last day men are
[1:32:06] creating their own god
[1:32:10] so you know you have a catholic god who
[1:32:13] has to mind his mother
[1:32:18] right
[1:32:19] the catholics have their own god they
[1:32:21] got their own jesus they made a jesus
[1:32:23] that has to mind mama so if you really
[1:32:26] want something from him don't talk to
[1:32:28] him because you know he's got this hard
[1:32:31] heart you know and he's not going to
[1:32:32] listen but if you can get his mother to
[1:32:34] listen to you
[1:32:36] she can appeal to the heart of jesus who
[1:32:38] will appeal to the heart of the father
[1:32:40] and i don't know who he appeals to
[1:32:49] and father is really delinquent
[1:32:52] he's really don't really care about you
[1:32:56] it's the heart of mary who gets the
[1:32:58] heart of the son who really cared about
[1:33:00] you who
[1:33:01] and somehow another but the baptists
[1:33:04] have their own
[1:33:06] methodists have their own
[1:33:09] their halls of theologies have crafted
[1:33:12] their own jesus
[1:33:16] and paul told us that there would come
[1:33:18] this fallen away
[1:33:20] and he and he said actually that
[1:33:23] god would be worshipped or this
[1:33:25] satan would be worshiped as god but in
[1:33:29] the last day
[1:33:30] the mask
[1:33:32] would be taken off of him
[1:33:35] and we would see
[1:33:36] who it really was that people are
[1:33:39] worshiping
[1:33:41] amen now so as you if you look at it
[1:33:43] just for a moment i want you to
[1:33:45] understand you see where
[1:33:48] it's they've turned another gospel and
[1:33:50] if we're not careful in this message
[1:33:52] we'll make another jesus
[1:33:58] in fact
[1:33:59] if you're not careful you make brother
[1:34:00] branham jesus
[1:34:02] or equal to him or you'll demote jesus
[1:34:05] until he's just another man and
[1:34:08] really you know he ain't no different
[1:34:09] from any of us and just our elder
[1:34:12] brother and
[1:34:15] what kind of spirit is in this that was
[1:34:18] once to try to attack this message
[1:34:21] that would try to make
[1:34:23] brother branham god
[1:34:25] and jesus less than god
[1:34:31] if there's another gospel
[1:34:34] as paul spoke to one of the groups i'm
[1:34:36] so surprised you have turned to another
[1:34:39] gospel
[1:34:40] which there is no other but a make
[1:34:42] belief to a denominational fiction
[1:34:46] churning from that good news and because
[1:34:48] i live you live also
[1:34:51] and i live in you and the works that i
[1:34:53] do john 14 12 the works that i do will
[1:34:56] identify myself in you
[1:34:59] what a message no wonder we had a dark
[1:35:02] world of theology but in the evening
[1:35:04] time there shall be light again
[1:35:07] there is a resurrection in the evening
[1:35:10] time
[1:35:11] did somebody hear that amen it shall be
[1:35:14] lied in the evening time and the very
[1:35:16] essence of the of the message that was
[1:35:19] sent is that he has risen from the dead
[1:35:22] and we his beneficiaries we who share
[1:35:25] the resurrection with him draw benefits
[1:35:28] from this by proving to the world that
[1:35:30] he is alive
[1:35:32] we cannot do it by word only we cannot
[1:35:35] do it by some tradition of man we only
[1:35:38] reflect exactly what we are pointing to
[1:35:42] and i'm afraid today that too many of us
[1:35:44] are not getting people to christ
[1:35:47] we're getting them to a church
[1:35:49] to a theory
[1:35:51] but we must
[1:35:52] listen here we must
[1:35:55] get them to christ he's the only one and
[1:35:58] the only one that has life
[1:36:00] he that has the son has life
[1:36:05] and if the life of a dead a man that's
[1:36:07] dead and being projected in you you'll
[1:36:09] live the same life he lived if the blood
[1:36:12] there was a certain type you took that
[1:36:14] blood from a man change the blood from
[1:36:15] one man to another you'd absolutely be
[1:36:18] that type blood and if your spirit
[1:36:20] that's in you is wrecking dead and
[1:36:22] you're anointed with the light that was
[1:36:24] in christ is upon you romans 8 11 if the
[1:36:27] spirit that raised christ from the dead
[1:36:29] dwells in you it will also quicken your
[1:36:32] mortal body that same life them same
[1:36:34] powers and same benefits that he had
[1:36:36] here on earth from god he redeemed you a
[1:36:39] seed that was foreknown by god whose
[1:36:41] names was put on the lamb's book of life
[1:36:44] before the foundation of the world
[1:36:47] hallelujah so i'm going to announce
[1:36:49] today there has to be a bride who are
[1:36:52] the people of the resurrection who are
[1:36:55] prepared amen to meet the bridegroom
[1:37:00] god has left it for this last age
[1:37:03] for there to come a bride without a spot
[1:37:07] or wrinkle or blemish that he can
[1:37:09] present to himself
[1:37:13] not an immature girl
[1:37:17] like in the days of luther
[1:37:20] not a preteen
[1:37:22] like in the days of wesley
[1:37:25] that's why this is bride time
[1:37:27] this is time when she puts on the full
[1:37:29] word and walks down the aisle
[1:37:32] becomes one with him takes on his name
[1:37:34] somebody help me preach
[1:37:35] amen
[1:37:37] not a not a not a teeny bopper like the
[1:37:40] like the azusa movement
[1:37:42] infatuated and dazzled with gifts and
[1:37:45] not the giver
[1:37:47] come on but a mature elect lady
[1:37:51] ready and willing to take on his name
[1:37:54] one who has his identity
[1:37:58] there's a people of the resurrection who
[1:38:00] have received a name change
[1:38:05] hallelujah you know at a wedding there
[1:38:08] is a name of change
[1:38:12] the girl completes her name as for the
[1:38:15] last time
[1:38:17] saying in a paper where she becomes in
[1:38:20] union with a husband and she signs her
[1:38:23] name that way the last time
[1:38:26] let's say you're one of these modern
[1:38:28] females
[1:38:31] which reflect in the modern church that
[1:38:33] won't take on his name
[1:38:38] right
[1:38:39] amen because as as a modern female don't
[1:38:43] want the name or she wants to keep her
[1:38:45] own name she wants her own identity
[1:38:57] we've got the pentecostal people today
[1:38:59] he said too many rickey's
[1:39:02] too many elvises that word elvis and
[1:39:04] ricky you never heard of that in other
[1:39:07] days it's a word it's the name for this
[1:39:08] day it goes with it it means something
[1:39:11] say a name means nothing then why did he
[1:39:13] change abram's name to abraham
[1:39:16] what he changed saul's name to paul
[1:39:18] simon's name to peter why did he change
[1:39:21] his own name
[1:39:23] why did he change jacob to israel not
[1:39:26] until he wrestled with the lord not
[1:39:27] until he overcome and when jesus
[1:39:31] overcome death hell in the grave the
[1:39:33] bible said he had a new name and when
[1:39:36] jacob overcome now listen
[1:39:39] and if the church can overcome
[1:39:42] she will stop saying a methodist baptist
[1:39:45] and presbyterian
[1:39:47] hallelujah
[1:39:48] you see
[1:39:50] you see we must stop saying that
[1:39:52] because these are defined
[1:39:54] and the bible as blasphemous names
[1:39:58] or names of blasphemy
[1:40:01] because to be listen to me now to be
[1:40:03] called anything besides the name of your
[1:40:07] bridegroom is the mark of a headless
[1:40:10] rebellious woman can i say it plainly oh
[1:40:14] harlot
[1:40:19] and brother branham said when she can
[1:40:21] overcome her creeds
[1:40:23] and the world that's drawn into there
[1:40:26] she'll come back to being the bride of
[1:40:29] jesus christ miss jesus christ
[1:40:34] hallelujah hey man we've done the same
[1:40:36] thing around oh i'm two souls i'm
[1:40:38] perusing i i tell you we we're seven
[1:40:41] thunderers we're well listen church
[1:40:44] you've got to die to that name
[1:40:46] amen when you overcome you will die to
[1:40:50] that name and overcome the creeds that
[1:40:53] that throw her in there and come back to
[1:40:55] the bride of jesus christ miss jesus
[1:40:59] christ
[1:41:04] miss jesus
[1:41:06] mistress jesus
[1:41:08] wife
[1:41:10] amen
[1:41:11] amen
[1:41:13] see church we we we are actually in a
[1:41:15] day
[1:41:16] we're excellent today and i don't want
[1:41:18] to make a doctrine out of this because
[1:41:20] we can say we're the bride of christ
[1:41:22] that's fine
[1:41:23] but we're actually
[1:41:25] because a man's wife is always his bride
[1:41:29] remember we've actually transitioned
[1:41:31] beyond that
[1:41:33] amen we are the lamb's wife
[1:41:39] a bride has a certain right she has a
[1:41:41] certain
[1:41:43] certain ring she has certain identities
[1:41:45] she is a bright elect
[1:41:48] but when she becomes a wife
[1:41:51] she becomes
[1:41:52] coheir with him
[1:41:54] amen
[1:41:56] when they get married he takes on her
[1:41:58] debt amen
[1:42:01] amen hallelujah aren't you glad
[1:42:04] i owe the debt i could not pay
[1:42:07] he paid the debt he didn't know
[1:42:10] i needed someone to wash my sins away
[1:42:14] amen and when he took me as his bride
[1:42:18] and mother claimed me as his wife he
[1:42:20] paid every day of mine
[1:42:23] and i'm free
[1:42:25] [Music]
[1:42:29] not only sin that but the unbelief death
[1:42:32] of seven ages
[1:42:35] piled up from
[1:42:37] misconceptions of ages past
[1:42:40] liens that the devil had against us he
[1:42:43] took the book
[1:42:46] and did a title search
[1:42:50] and searched it all the way back to the
[1:42:51] beginning
[1:42:53] tell me what age
[1:42:55] tell me what day
[1:42:57] that could tell us who the seven stars
[1:42:59] of revelation are
[1:43:01] amen tell me what other age could say
[1:43:04] these are more than cities there these
[1:43:07] are ages
[1:43:09] and here's the spirits that dominated
[1:43:11] them and here's where we are in the last
[1:43:13] age
[1:43:17] hallelujah
[1:43:18] amen you see the
[1:43:20] there again we we're people who have
[1:43:23] come
[1:43:24] within to marriage rights
[1:43:31] whatever he owns we own
[1:43:35] whatever we bind he binds
[1:43:38] whatever we lose he loses
[1:43:42] we are become his representation
[1:43:46] we are not truly another person we have
[1:43:48] been made one with him
[1:43:51] though we don't lose our individuality
[1:43:53] we still have been made one and
[1:43:55] connected with another
[1:43:57] we are no longer single
[1:44:00] we are one
[1:44:01] we do not act independently we act as
[1:44:05] one
[1:44:11] now
[1:44:12] these people who are the resurrected out
[1:44:15] of sin
[1:44:16] and recreated as
[1:44:18] they are recreated as a new creation out
[1:44:21] of the decay of sin
[1:44:23] and death
[1:44:25] resurrected into a new life
[1:44:28] there is
[1:44:30] no smell of death
[1:44:32] upon them
[1:44:34] there is no creed
[1:44:36] no smell of a creed no smell of a dogma
[1:44:40] somebody help me preach
[1:44:42] now i i want you to understand
[1:44:45] to to know jesus that i may know him
[1:44:48] said you know it's impossible to
[1:44:51] understand his ministry and who he is
[1:44:55] without understanding the the larger
[1:44:58] view of redemption sweeping salvage plan
[1:45:02] you see his miracles
[1:45:04] that are wrought today are the same
[1:45:07] miracles
[1:45:08] as he wrote back there
[1:45:10] amen they are miracles of restoration
[1:45:14] restoration to health restoration to
[1:45:17] life
[1:45:18] restoration to freedom from demonic
[1:45:21] possession
[1:45:22] amen jesus miracles are 2 000 years ago
[1:45:26] and his miracles today provide us with
[1:45:29] we it provides us with the meaning that
[1:45:32] they're just samples of of them of his
[1:45:34] of his redemption power
[1:45:37] amen freeing a creation from shackles of
[1:45:40] sin
[1:45:41] amen sickness from evil from and and a
[1:45:45] reinstatement
[1:45:47] of her being the bride that she was at
[1:45:50] pentecost
[1:45:51] [Music]
[1:45:54] so the resurrection
[1:45:57] is a re-introduction
[1:46:01] that's also what resurrection means
[1:46:05] re-introduction of a bride without spot
[1:46:09] or wrinkle
[1:46:10] or blemish
[1:46:13] a virgin bride they are pure without
[1:46:16] spot
[1:46:19] they walk with him in white
[1:46:21] and they are worthy
[1:46:24] amen it's the bride of the book of acts
[1:46:27] reintroduced
[1:46:30] come on church
[1:46:31] you see this bride of this last day
[1:46:34] she has not only been seen
[1:46:37] in review but she's been seen in preview
[1:46:43] hallelujah
[1:46:45] you you see again that that's exactly
[1:46:48] what it means to take the title is to
[1:46:50] review all the transitions
[1:46:52] from the original owner
[1:46:55] and you review every one of them and
[1:46:57] then the debts that was incurred uh
[1:47:01] during the time they all had to be paid
[1:47:03] and reconciled
[1:47:06] i'm so glad we had a prophet in this day
[1:47:08] and hour
[1:47:09] who did it through the holy spirit of
[1:47:11] title search
[1:47:13] listen george if he could go back in
[1:47:15] your life 50 years
[1:47:17] he could go all the way back to the days
[1:47:19] of paul irenaeus martin luther wesley
[1:47:24] come on to azusa street he can go right
[1:47:28] back to all of them and search the title
[1:47:31] amen
[1:47:33] okay i see right here now here it was
[1:47:36] handed down to this age from wesley
[1:47:40] and this now
[1:47:41] with this handed down from wesley it was
[1:47:44] handed from luther
[1:47:46] and from luther is another messenger and
[1:47:50] that was columba
[1:47:52] or
[1:47:53] and then and then there was martin and
[1:47:55] ireneus
[1:47:56] and then paul
[1:48:00] and here's where it started out the
[1:48:02] church the original owner
[1:48:04] now coming back
[1:48:06] and now we've got to clear all the deed
[1:48:08] so all the debt is paid yes
[1:48:12] because it's rapture time
[1:48:16] will remind you when i started a series
[1:48:19] on the people of the book
[1:48:21] i started out with
[1:48:23] with the discovery of
[1:48:25] of the um
[1:48:26] the actual discovery of uh of the the
[1:48:29] scrolls
[1:48:32] the dead sea scrolls
[1:48:34] were a little simple shepherd boy
[1:48:38] took a stone
[1:48:40] and threw it down into a dark cave
[1:48:44] and he heard something break
[1:48:46] and he went down to investigate and he
[1:48:49] comes back out
[1:48:50] with the books of isaiah
[1:48:52] the books of the prophets
[1:48:55] the sacred scrolls
[1:48:57] this was 1948 the same time that israel
[1:49:00] became a nation
[1:49:03] and it would now give proof
[1:49:05] amen they would give proof this book
[1:49:08] once it had been brought to light
[1:49:11] once it had been unsealed
[1:49:14] come on church
[1:49:16] once it had been brought to light and
[1:49:18] unsealed it proved through the world
[1:49:21] that israel was headed first
[1:49:25] they were there before the palestinians
[1:49:28] they were there before the arabs they
[1:49:31] were there before the english they were
[1:49:33] there before any other nation
[1:49:36] amen the book gave them the right to the
[1:49:39] land

[1:49:46] divine promise right to healing right to
[1:49:50] miracles right to salvation right to the
[1:49:53] baptism of the holy ghost right to true

[1:50:10] down into the dark cloisters that has
[1:50:12] been his word hidden in darkness for 2
[1:50:15] 000 years and the seals were broke
[1:50:19] hallelujah we heard the noise of the
[1:50:21] thunder amen and that thunder there was
[1:50:24] the voice of god speaking out
[1:50:26] amen and the book is no longer closed

[1:54:59] don't you think god provided the lamb
[1:55:01] for us in this day
[1:55:03] yes he did
[1:55:12] he saw a review
[1:55:14] of the original bride
[1:55:17] he saw the church
[1:55:20] pardon me for a moment
[1:55:22] but he saw the church
[1:55:25] as it
[1:55:26] degraded
[1:55:28] degenerated
[1:55:30] into a horus lewd
[1:55:33] stripped
[1:55:34] naked
[1:55:35] harlot
[1:55:38] dancing to the tune of rock and roll
[1:55:43] and after that
[1:55:45] he saw the preview
[1:55:48] remember first he was given a review
[1:55:51] then he was given a preview
[1:55:55] and like i said this is more than bill
[1:55:57] dallas
[1:55:59] amen i'll meet you in front of the build
[1:56:01] from front of the blue board restaurant
[1:56:03] and shake your hand
[1:56:05] that was enough for bill dowell to get
[1:56:06] out of bed
[1:56:08] amen to me to have maybe four or five
[1:56:11] while he actually lived past the prophet
[1:56:14] he would live for all three or four more
[1:56:16] years i i i'd not even cognitive when he
[1:56:19] really passed away but he lived for four
[1:56:21] to four to five years after brother
[1:56:23] branham passed
[1:56:26] but nevertheless
[1:56:28] he saw the preview a display
[1:56:32] of the bride
[1:56:34] before she's
[1:56:35] fully revealed
[1:56:38] that's what a preview is
[1:56:40] amen it's a display
[1:56:44] of the bride before she's fully
[1:56:47] revealed
[1:56:49] or manifested
[1:56:51] so he said when this bride she was
[1:56:53] looking at me
[1:56:54] as i was standing there together
[1:56:57] her eyes she was the cleanest
[1:57:00] sweetest looking people i'd ever seen in
[1:57:02] my life
[1:57:04] oh god
[1:57:06] message people don't lose
[1:57:08] that
[1:57:10] you don't fit the vision
[1:57:14] that means when it's fulfilled you're
[1:57:16] not a part of it
[1:57:18] when you're dressing like a harlot
[1:57:21] when our girls or my clothes are melted
[1:57:23] and poured into
[1:57:25] can't move without sinning when you're
[1:57:27] when you're when your skirts are above
[1:57:30] your knees
[1:57:31] when you're standing or sitting when you
[1:57:33] gotta slid up to the gates of hell
[1:57:38] oh god
[1:57:40] amen you don't fit the vision
[1:57:43] i mean you got to fit the vision you say
[1:57:46] brother brother tim said i i said i just
[1:57:48] kind of conformed no don't conform be
[1:57:51] changed
[1:57:53] be transformed by the renewing of your
[1:57:56] mind
[1:57:58] where you look at sin the way god looks
[1:58:00] at sin like your husband looks at sin
[1:58:07] we want to streak our hair this and we
[1:58:09] can blend them there and we can just
[1:58:11] keep one step in the world and
[1:58:21] cleanest
[1:58:23] sweetest
[1:58:24] looking people
[1:58:26] i ever seen in my life
[1:58:29] looked like they could have been a dozen
[1:58:30] or more
[1:58:32] i don't know remember they're just
[1:58:33] representing it
[1:58:38] i don't know how many was the breasts
[1:58:39] but there was just a group of them and
[1:58:42] she passed by sweetly with an air
[1:58:46] her eyes up watching
[1:58:49] hello
[1:58:51] as she passed by
[1:58:53] and she was beautiful
[1:58:56] and i looked at her and she as she
[1:58:58] passed by and he says
[1:59:01] now that's the bride
[1:59:03] now we'll con we'll we shall review
[1:59:06] the churches
[1:59:08] and when they come
[1:59:09] i noticed them coming up
[1:59:13] and when they come up each one looked
[1:59:15] like got worse
[1:59:18] and i've never seen such a filthy bunch
[1:59:20] in my life
[1:59:23] and when i said next i heard a noise
[1:59:26] and here comes the american group
[1:59:30] and he said
[1:59:31] they were totally naked
[1:59:34] except for something gray that they were
[1:59:36] holding in front of them
[1:59:38] and she danced to the tune of rock and
[1:59:40] roll and when they passed by there was
[1:59:42] nothing it was totally naked
[1:59:47] and that fits the scripture revelation
[1:59:49] chapter 3
[1:59:51] because revelation 3 to the laodicean
[1:59:54] age she is naked
[2:00:00] let me stop just for a minute that
[2:00:02] nakedness is nothing like
[2:00:05] even the nakedness that we're talking
[2:00:06] about and
[2:00:07] and there's too many that are are
[2:00:10] naked the nakedness you can see
[2:00:14] you can see there's no modesty anymore
[2:00:18] but that nakedness is nothing comparison
[2:00:22] to the nakedness of going there
[2:00:25] and hadn't appeared to god
[2:00:28] in the sinful body you sinned in
[2:00:36] are you listening to me now
[2:00:40] you don't want to try to take this body
[2:00:42] you do not want to die
[2:00:44] in the condition you're in
[2:00:47] with a body that has not been claimed
[2:00:50] for the
[2:00:51] resurrection amen because you have never
[2:00:56] known nakedness
[2:00:59] like that nakedness
[2:01:02] now
[2:01:03] i watched her this american group
[2:01:05] dancing to the tune of rock and roll
[2:01:08] and then he said i heard that real sweet
[2:01:11] music come again and here come that
[2:01:14] little bride coming again
[2:01:16] and and he says
[2:01:19] this is what comes out though and she
[2:01:20] walked by and she was exactly like the
[2:01:23] one in the first place walking to the
[2:01:26] step of the music of god's word marching
[2:01:29] on by
[2:01:31] and when i saw it i stood there with
[2:01:33] both hands up crying like that and when
[2:01:36] i come to i was standing on my porch out
[2:01:39] there looking across the field what
[2:01:42] she's got to be the same bride
[2:01:45] the same kind
[2:01:47] built out of the same kind of material
[2:01:49] that she was in the first place now read
[2:01:52] malachi 4 and see if we're not supposed
[2:01:54] to have a message in the last days that
[2:01:56] will turn the hearts of the children
[2:01:58] back to the fathers back to the original
[2:02:00] pentecostal message word by word
[2:02:04] brothers
[2:02:05] we are here
[2:02:07] amen that's my announcement to you this
[2:02:10] morning brothers we are here
[2:02:12] amen the same original pentecostal
[2:02:15] message word by word
[2:02:19] you see it was this
[2:02:21] age of laodicea there would be the age
[2:02:24] that the church would return to be in
[2:02:26] the bride she was at pentecost
[2:02:29] so we know there must be an of necessity
[2:02:32] be a return of dynamic power
[2:02:35] this is what's expected you see
[2:02:38] now as in the vision of the preview of
[2:02:40] the bride the one at the beginning was
[2:02:43] reintroduced at the end
[2:02:46] now brother branham tells us and what
[2:02:49] does it take to make a christian life he
[2:02:52] said now if the church of the living god
[2:02:54] which is the pillar of truth god
[2:02:56] intended this church to be a powerful
[2:02:59] church
[2:03:00] a glorious church a church that the
[2:03:03] whole world could look upon as a bride
[2:03:07] of christ well expected in the spouse
[2:03:10] and to live in such an atmosphere and
[2:03:13] conduct itself in such a way that god
[2:03:16] would be proud of this church to present
[2:03:18] it to christ at the coming of the lord
[2:03:21] it should live in that characteristic in
[2:03:24] the church it should be living that way
[2:03:28] hallelujah
[2:03:30] think about that what he said amen a
[2:03:32] glorious church a powerful church
[2:03:35] notice as he said in the message pardon
[2:03:38] this is after the seals god hates a
[2:03:41] powerless religion
[2:03:43] it's got to be power certainly it's a
[2:03:46] power to save a man from sin it's a
[2:03:49] power that can do signs and wonders and
[2:03:51] miracles as jesus promised they zeroed
[2:03:54] in on the word of god back there and
[2:03:56] believed it and hit the target you zero
[2:03:58] the same way on the word of god it'll
[2:04:01] hit the target again it's got to because
[2:04:03] he's the same yesterday today and
[2:04:05] forever god don't like a powerless
[2:04:08] religion
[2:04:10] god does not want that
[2:04:13] god wants to perform
[2:04:18] god wants to show himself alive
[2:04:21] our very hopes is a resurrection is that
[2:04:23] right our hopes of life is a
[2:04:25] resurrection and the resurrection of
[2:04:28] jesus christ you see god wants to work
[2:04:32] in his church jesus said i'll be with
[2:04:34] you always even to the end of the world
[2:04:37] the what should i do shall you do also
[2:04:40] john 14 12.
[2:04:43] now god's relationship
[2:04:46] with his church and i'm running out of
[2:04:47] time now
[2:04:49] but let me just wind down and just get
[2:04:50] you a few points
[2:04:52] god's relationship i may cover this
[2:04:54] again
[2:04:56] but his relationship with his church
[2:04:58] is to be like a loving marriage
[2:05:02] paul likens it to marriage
[2:05:04] he says husbands love your wives
[2:05:06] ephesians 5 25 love your wives even as
[2:05:10] christ loved the church
[2:05:12] and gave himself for it
[2:05:14] that he may sanctify and cleanse it with
[2:05:17] the washing of the water
[2:05:19] of water by the word
[2:05:22] that he might presented to himself
[2:05:24] a glorious church
[2:05:26] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[2:05:29] thing but that it should be holy and
[2:05:31] without
[2:05:33] now we know god is love that's what god
[2:05:36] is that's his nature
[2:05:38] amen that's the essence of his great
[2:05:40] being it's a substance that determines
[2:05:43] his character that's why brother branham
[2:05:45] believed that the baptism of the holy
[2:05:47] ghost is divine love
[2:05:50] amen now love is not his evidence he
[2:05:52] told us that
[2:05:54] neither is shouting or speaking in
[2:05:55] tongues it's evidence
[2:05:57] amen but it's he that can receive the
[2:06:00] word of god
[2:06:02] not just as a creed or a dogma but as a
[2:06:04] life-changing experience that causes you
[2:06:08] to walk in his statutes and do his
[2:06:10] judgments
[2:06:11] amen now so again in contrast to the
[2:06:14] bride there is a woman
[2:06:17] who is claiming to be his queen
[2:06:19] and she's a wicked woman she has no love
[2:06:22] for him
[2:06:23] she hates what he stands for and she
[2:06:25] tries to change him into a creature of
[2:06:28] her own liking
[2:06:33] but there is a people that he said the
[2:06:35] bride will love him listen
[2:06:38] god wrote it about you
[2:06:40] pick up your pen and write this
[2:06:44] amen come on church
[2:06:46] and then god's thoughts about you
[2:06:48] the bride will love him
[2:06:51] and have his potentials
[2:06:53] she will be like him
[2:06:55] because they will be one
[2:06:59] hallelujah can't you see can i just get
[2:07:02] it just for a moment can i let let's
[2:07:04] just let's just roll down just for a
[2:07:06] moment i want to try to get down to this
[2:07:08] thought of this revelation chapter one
[2:07:10] i've been hitting that in service after
[2:07:13] service and as we as we speak at it for
[2:07:16] a moment i want to just clench the nail
[2:07:18] as we go into this but let's get this
[2:07:22] thought real clear
[2:07:23] you know that that brother what brother
[2:07:26] branham was talking about this oneness
[2:07:28] do you know when he looked at revelation
[2:07:30] 1 at this mighty one he first would see
[2:07:35] that as
[2:07:37] instead of christ it'd be being his
[2:07:39] bride
[2:07:42] in revelation 1 this mighty one this one
[2:07:44] that was said i am he that was dead but
[2:07:47] i'm alive forevermore brother branham
[2:07:49] would look at that and he said i see
[2:07:51] more than jesus standing there
[2:07:55] he said i actually see his bride
[2:07:58] amen this is from the seven church ages
[2:08:01] he said when one likened to the son of
[2:08:03] man he said what was it his bride
[2:08:07] can you imagine brother branham is
[2:08:09] looking at jesus
[2:08:12] and he sees more than jesus
[2:08:15] he sees you in there
[2:08:18] are you with me church he sees a people
[2:08:21] that are one with him
[2:08:23] amen that when that when you see her
[2:08:25] you've seen the father
[2:08:27] when you see her you see jesus
[2:08:30] because she is his living representation
[2:08:33] of him upon the earth
[2:08:36] she was covered with a with a garment
[2:08:38] down to her foot you remember we were
[2:08:40] reading it revelation 1
[2:08:42] a man a garment down the foot he said
[2:08:44] that's the holiness of jesus christ
[2:08:46] governor
[2:08:48] amen and she was girded about uh the
[2:08:50] paps and he said with a golden girdle he
[2:08:52] said see i see a a man not a man i see a
[2:08:56] woman here
[2:08:57] the gospel that held the power and the
[2:08:59] glory of god over the body of christ
[2:09:02] that's what has he heard girded about
[2:09:05] with a golden girdle it's the gospel
[2:09:07] with power and glory of god over her
[2:09:10] body
[2:09:11] the body of christ he said i see more
[2:09:14] than jesus i see his body
[2:09:17] i see his people there revelation 1
[2:09:20] no wonder when he said i am he that was
[2:09:22] dead but behold i am alive forevermore
[2:09:26] amen and don't just speak of the groom
[2:09:28] it speaks also of the bride
[2:09:30] because we were dead
[2:09:33] but this message brought us resurrection
[2:09:35] life
[2:09:39] oh he said his head and his hair was
[2:09:41] white like well the white is of
[2:09:43] righteousness and holiness
[2:09:45] and his eyes like flames of fire he can
[2:09:48] look right through you
[2:09:50] don't try to hide from him he knows who
[2:09:52] you are what you are what you've done he
[2:09:54] sees everything
[2:09:56] his feet were like fine brass
[2:09:59] brass also is also his judgment
[2:10:02] his feet then
[2:10:03] the church of jesus christ
[2:10:06] uh is set upon the divine judgment
[2:10:08] christ dying in our stead the just one
[2:10:11] paying for our judgments here up there
[2:10:13] before
[2:10:14] before god died there as a sinner on the
[2:10:17] cross his soul descended into hell and
[2:10:19] god not suffering his holy one to seek
[2:10:21] corruption raise him up on the third day
[2:10:23] for our justification who sits his right
[2:10:26] hand now as a high priest and can be
[2:10:29] touched with the feelings of our
[2:10:30] infirmity which i returned in like
[2:10:32] manner as he went into heaven to receive
[2:10:35] a glorious church that's made herself

[2:11:39] roars of the great cataracts the falls
[2:11:42] what a horrible thing it would be to a
[2:11:44] soul-drifting voice of many waters

[2:13:44] tombs
[2:13:47] sealed in a baptist tomb a catholic tomb
[2:13:50] a methodist tomb and
[2:13:51] sealed down and bound down with every
[2:13:53] kind of dogma
[2:13:55] but death couldn't hold you
[2:13:57] because you were predestinated to life
[2:14:01] you had to come forth
[2:14:03] you couldn't stay there
[2:14:05] amen you've been changed into his image
[2:14:08] until you become his voice here upon the
[2:14:11] earth and now his voice is in his people
[2:14:17] what almighty god we serve
[2:14:20] let the musicians come right now
[2:14:22] i want you to just reflect on this for a
[2:14:24] moment
[2:14:26] i want you to think about it
[2:14:30] oh you don't want to be there that day
[2:14:32] like a drifting soul
[2:14:34] out on the sea of time and your time is
[2:14:36] up here on the earth
[2:14:39] you're caught in between
[2:14:41] you can't go there
[2:14:42] and the judgment isn't yet
[2:14:45] and you can't come back to earth
[2:14:48] and you're caught
[2:14:51] a wandering spirit waiting for your time
[2:14:53] for judgment
[2:14:55] you don't think brother branham
[2:14:57] taught that go listen to
[2:15:00] present stage of my ministry
[2:15:05] listen to sermons like that i can give
[2:15:06] you some other references i think it's
[2:15:08] even in countdown there's several of
[2:15:10] them he mentions it
[2:15:12] a drifting soul
[2:15:15] you know why you didn't make an anchor
[2:15:16] here
[2:15:20] you got to make your anchor here
[2:15:23] it's got to be your anchor
[2:15:26] troubled waters are coming
[2:15:29] stabilizers are going to be on the ship
[2:15:32] brother timothy read that the other day
[2:15:33] and said here's
[2:15:35] one of my favorite quotes
[2:15:37] i can remember back in
[2:15:39] 1981
[2:15:42] 1981
[2:15:45] in anniston alabama
[2:15:48] i was struggling to find something to
[2:15:50] preach to a little congregation of
[2:15:51] people that lost their pastor
[2:15:55] he died in a drowned in accident i went
[2:15:58] and
[2:15:58] helped bury him and then would
[2:16:02] pastor his church just
[2:16:04] is
[2:16:05] temporarily just to try to help them his
[2:16:07] intern
[2:16:11] there that morning as i struggled with
[2:16:14] what to preach
[2:16:17] god had me to preach stabilizers on the
[2:16:19] ship
[2:16:23] and there was a young hippie boy there
[2:16:25] with hair down his shoulder
[2:16:27] a shirt that wouldn't meet his belly
[2:16:30] or his pants and showed his belly button
[2:16:36] a boy who had come to church there
[2:16:38] smoking marijuana
[2:16:41] you know him
[2:16:43] vernon winters
[2:16:46] and that day in the presence of god god
[2:16:49] sanctified him
[2:16:51] he cried out to god and
[2:16:53] his wife at that time reached and
[2:16:55] grabbed him she was just a young worldly
[2:16:57] girl sister gina grabbed him and held
[2:16:59] him there and tried to comfort him but
[2:17:01] he couldn't be comforted
[2:17:03] he kept praying and crying out until god
[2:17:06] sanctified him
[2:17:07] threw his marijuana out the window as he
[2:17:09] left
[2:17:10] the church
[2:17:12] he would come and be a part of the
[2:17:13] church
[2:17:16] and even though he had his struggles in
[2:17:18] his time god would never let go of him
[2:17:21] he always would be the stabilizer that
[2:17:24] would anchor him back again
[2:17:27] and when he left from here he left here
[2:17:29] anchored
[2:17:36] but god wants to put stabilizers on your
[2:17:38] ship
[2:17:41] i've anchored my soul in the haven of
[2:17:42] rest
[2:17:44] god wants to do it for you
[2:17:48] where you become his voice will you
[2:17:49] become one with him
[2:17:52] well i don't think
[2:17:54] i don't think this about i don't think
[2:17:56] of this about it doesn't matter
[2:17:59] the message
[2:18:01] you can be saved and believe anything
[2:18:04] i don't even know
[2:18:07] what they they present jesus too
[2:18:10] they talk about jesus also
[2:18:12] [Music]
[2:18:15] it don't matter
[2:18:16] i'll keep my own identity
[2:18:19] i'll live my own life
[2:18:22] i'll do my own thing i i don't have to
[2:18:24] take his name
[2:18:26] oh yeah i can take it informally and get
[2:18:28] baptized maybe that'll make my parents
[2:18:30] happy get them
[2:18:32] off my back
[2:18:36] ah maybe i'll get a few little pats on
[2:18:38] tobacco people recognize me you see that
[2:18:40] baptizes you into the fellowship of
[2:18:42] believers
[2:18:44] but they don't baptize you into christ
[2:18:50] there's only one by one spirit we're all
[2:18:53] baptized into the body of christ
[2:18:57] baptism will baptize you into the
[2:18:59] fellowship of a local body
[2:19:02] but the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:19:08] it baptizes you into the fellowship of
[2:19:11] christ
[2:19:13] because now he is in you and you are in
[2:19:15] him
[2:19:16] [Music]
[2:19:18] wouldn't it be wonderful that
[2:19:20] somebody could look at you and see jesus
[2:19:24] well
[2:19:26] it's
[2:19:27] it's not exactly him
[2:19:30] but the way he sees acting
[2:19:33] sees his wife
[2:19:37] she just looks like
[2:19:40] the way she behaves the way she talks
[2:19:42] the way she addresses
[2:19:44] the way she loves
[2:19:48] she loves like jesus
[2:19:53] any time to have a stabilizer put on
[2:19:56] your ship
[2:19:57] we're coming into some rough waters
[2:20:00] it ain't getting better
[2:20:04] don't wait until this smoke
[2:20:07] binds your eyes
[2:20:08] [Music]
[2:20:10] because it'll get right down into that
[2:20:13] where you you just can't see
[2:20:16] and you'll be your vision will be
[2:20:18] clouded and
[2:20:20] you'll be like seeing things just like
[2:20:21] the rest of the world
[2:20:24] they'll lead you off down a path come on
[2:20:27] here come on come on come walk with me
[2:20:30] some little girl at school or some boy
[2:20:33] or this or that or some comrade at work
[2:20:37] come on come walk with me
[2:20:41] you get pulled down along the path
[2:20:45] until their real identity is shown and
[2:20:47] they're not your friends
[2:20:49] and they begin to tear you to pieces
[2:20:53] take away your virtue your holiness
[2:20:56] take away your identity as a child of
[2:20:58] god
[2:21:00] pull you down a path of unrighteousness
[2:21:04] to where you're just in pieces
[2:21:07] your ears are gone you can't hear the
[2:21:08] spirit
[2:21:10] your eyes are gone they're plucked out
[2:21:12] until you can't see
[2:21:13] what is really going on in the world
[2:21:17] darkness overtake you and they leave you
[2:21:19] like a piece of garbage on the floor
[2:21:22] because that's the way the devil does
[2:21:24] he'll use you for a moment
[2:21:28] first pleasure
[2:21:31] and trash you
[2:21:33] and leave you crumpled in a pile
[2:21:37] and every time you move
[2:21:39] he'll just pull you a little closer
[2:21:43] into the depths of despair
[2:21:45] [Music]
[2:21:49] i want to talk to you just a moment
[2:21:52] if you bow your head just with me just a
[2:21:54] moment
[2:21:56] you know your life is unstable you know
[2:21:58] you've been pulled in every direction
[2:22:00] you know exactly
[2:22:01] [Music]
[2:22:05] but you
[2:22:06] hear
[2:22:08] you hear
[2:22:10] there's an exodus
[2:22:14] you're just like a little bite of the
[2:22:15] lamb this morning maybe that bite will
[2:22:17] only get you to justification just where
[2:22:19] your sins of pastor gone but
[2:22:23] that would be a wonderful start got to
[2:22:25] start somewhere
[2:22:27] [Music]
[2:22:31] so well everybody in the church is
[2:22:33] full-fledged christian know they're
[2:22:35] justified ones
[2:22:36] there are sanctified ones
[2:22:39] there are some people just been anointed
[2:22:41] with the holy ghost and they jump and
[2:22:42] shout and ran the aisle but there are
[2:22:43] some that are really sealed to the day
[2:22:45] of redemption
[2:22:46] [Music]
[2:22:49] but i'm asking you today
[2:22:51] with the things that are coming on the
[2:22:53] land
[2:22:55] [Music]
[2:22:56] there's this push
[2:22:58] to become vaccinated and
[2:23:01] a push to be
[2:23:02] inoculated and a push
[2:23:05] all of them government decrees and oh
[2:23:08] we'll not force you and we're not and
[2:23:10] then turn around and find ways to force
[2:23:12] you and
[2:23:13] all of this and americans are standing
[2:23:15] up it's my american right i will not be
[2:23:17] vaccinated you will not push me around
[2:23:20] you got all this fight
[2:23:23] what good does it do
[2:23:27] it's all for nothing
[2:23:28] no matter whether you are end
[2:23:31] if you're not inoculated with christ
[2:23:34] i'll tell you what i've got a vaccine
[2:23:36] today
[2:23:37] that will inoculate you from sin
[2:23:41] that inoculates you and make you a real
[2:23:44] child of god change you in his presence
[2:23:49] i want to ask you if you receive that
[2:23:52] it's a divine vaccine it was a
[2:23:54] prescription given
[2:23:56] by an ancient
[2:23:58] prophet by the name of peter
[2:24:00] who gave a divine prescription that's
[2:24:03] unchangeable because god don't have to
[2:24:05] change it
[2:24:06] sin may mutate sin may come a different
[2:24:09] way sin may come and
[2:24:11] now in the way of your cell phone and
[2:24:13] pornography and all kinds of things and
[2:24:15] ways and gates is open it may change it
[2:24:18] it may have variance
[2:24:21] you may be faced with
[2:24:23] variants that other ages have never
[2:24:25] faced
[2:24:27] but this inoculation
[2:24:29] is against everything that satan could
[2:24:32] do
[2:24:33] no matter how much it mutates evolves or
[2:24:35] changes
[2:24:37] sin may get worse
[2:24:39] but this inoculation is even better
[2:24:43] for the promises unto you and to your
[2:24:45] children and to them that are far off
[2:24:48] even as many as the lord our god shall
[2:24:50] come
