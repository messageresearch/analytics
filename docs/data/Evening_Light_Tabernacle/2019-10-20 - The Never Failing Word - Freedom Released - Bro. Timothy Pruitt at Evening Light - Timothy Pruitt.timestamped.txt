[41:08] aside to worship Him and to hear from
[41:11] him Genesis 1 and verse 1 it says in the
[41:14] beginning God created the heaven and the
[41:17] earth and the earth was without form and
[41:20] void and darkness was upon the face of
[41:23] the deep and the Spirit of God moved
[41:25] upon the face of the waters
[41:28] and God said let there be light and
[41:31] there was light
[41:33] also Leviticus 25 and verse 9 then shall
[41:39] that cause the trumpet of Jubilee to
[41:41] sound on the tenth day of the seventh
[41:44] month in the Day of Atonement shall you
[41:46] make the trumpet sound throughout all

[41:58] jubilee unto you and you shall return
[42:01] every man unto his possessions and you
[42:05] shall turn every man unto his family a
[42:08] man will let you be seated this morning
[42:12] just like to speak to you on the
[42:15] never-failing word and then also freedom
[42:19] released amen him and how many's glad
[42:22] that your freedom has been given to you
[42:25] amen just been looking at these things
[42:28] for some time as we had been away from
[42:32] the pulpit for a moment with the team
[42:35] taking a few Wednesday nights and then
[42:36] our meetings and others like to say that
[42:39] some of the best meetings or not the
[42:41] best meetings I've ever been in in my
[42:42] life
[42:43] just seeing God moved for his people and
[42:46] how many of this morning can say God
[42:48] moved for me
[42:49] amen God reached down and touched me you
[42:52] know it's amazing how that you know some
[42:55] meetings I've talked to different than
[42:57] ministers and when you just all agree
[42:59] some meetings you know you have maybe
[43:02] out of five or six services you have a
[43:04] couple of them that were just
[43:05] outstanding but in this meeting I don't
[43:08] know I just think every one of them was
[43:10] outstanding God moving time after time
[43:13] after time and then just to see how
[43:16] everything was orchestrated of the Lord
[43:18] and how God put things in place I mean
[43:21] you know brother Ron preaching that
[43:23] Saturday night and taking it out of
[43:25] there and Zig light was burned and
[43:27] abigail was taken you know I was
[43:29] speaking to brother Josh just this week
[43:31] and he said you know that very week as
[43:33] they was preparing to comb actually the
[43:35] very evening they was leaving and trying
[43:37] to get things done and he's he's in the
[43:39] middle of building a house and got a lot
[43:42] of things going on and on his plate but
[43:43] he's trying to get out and and get out
[43:46] and get out on a good time and as they
[43:48] stopped to meet another family to bring
[43:50] some more young people with them they
[43:52] was eating in a restaurant and sister
[43:54] Abigail his youngest daughter there was
[43:57] started to having a panic attack and
[43:59] just a real fear coming over and she
[44:01] didn't want to come and so you know he
[44:04] said I as a father was just really
[44:06] feeling sorry for her and and thought
[44:09] well you know I'll talked I told her I
[44:10] talked to your mom and we'll find a
[44:12] place for you to stay and maybe with
[44:14] somebody and so he went to talk to him
[44:17] and sister Kimberly and she said no no
[44:20] no she's going with us said this is her
[44:22] time for deliverance and God
[44:24] orchestrating all of that and bringing
[44:26] all that together and and knowing that
[44:28] young lady and how that thing had been
[44:31] on her for her to be able to grab ahold
[44:33] of a man's arm and come out of the out
[44:35] of the mezzanine there and walk down it
[44:38] had to be God and God moving upon his
[44:41] people and and you know just hearing the
[44:44] voice of God speak service after service
[44:47] and it was such power and then not only
[44:51] just power but also vindication and God
[44:54] fulfilling his word and and bringing
[44:57] what he said to pass you know him and as
[44:59] our pastors been on healing and things
[45:01] and bringing that back to our remembers
[45:04] I thought you know Wednesday night was
[45:05] just a wonderful follow-up to that that
[45:08] healing is ours it's ours our possession
[45:12] it's not sicknesses not the glory of God
[45:15] Healing is the glory of God and I
[45:18] believe that's you know a lot of the
[45:19] devil's try to put on us you know
[45:21] through the theologians and things of
[45:23] this day you know an hour days past that
[45:26] that you know we had to bear those
[45:27] things we have to live with those things
[45:29] but he meant we're not amen of children
[45:32] of bondage we're children of freedom and
[45:34] God has brought in perfect Liberty a man
[45:37] in this hour that we're living by a
[45:39] message that was spoken you know as we
[45:41] look here I just thinking on these
[45:44] things as God would begin to speak the
[45:47] very first words that are written here
[45:49] in the Bible that he spoke let there be
[45:51] light and there was light it was a voice
[45:55] that was spoke into the darkness it was
[45:58] a voice that was spoke into nothingness
[46:00] but once that voice was released and
[46:03] most said nothing could stop it and
[46:06] nothing could keep it from coming to
[46:08] pass any man it had to fulfill what was
[46:12] in his mind and and I believe going God
[46:15] speaks in this day it has the same the
[46:17] same power the same vindication the same
[46:20] thing that thing that once it's released
[46:23] nothing can stop it but it will fulfill
[46:27] that which is which is in his mind you
[46:29] know and thinking about the Jubilee that
[46:32] was sounding in in the in the beginning
[46:34] of a creation that God was going to
[46:36] bring a perfect creation and he was
[46:39] going to bring it according to what was
[46:41] in his mind and and you know and then
[46:43] bringing it down into Leviticus as he
[46:45] would begin to tell the children of
[46:47] Israel that on the fiftieth year the
[46:49] trumpet shall sound and when it shall
[46:51] sound a bit Jubilee and every
[46:54] man can return to his possession now it
[46:57] did not hinge on him with whether the
[46:59] taskmaster was there the slave owner was
[47:01] there not or what or if if symptoms was
[47:04] there it didn't matter got none of that
[47:06] when that trumpet sounded Amen it had a
[47:10] voice that was released and that voice
[47:12] went forth into the land and nothing
[47:14] could stop a man nothing could put it
[47:17] back once it was sounded him in it once
[47:19] it was accepted it was over and it went
[47:22] beyond what the slave owner had to say
[47:24] anymore it wouldn't be on what he felt
[47:27] if he went beyond the symptoms that was
[47:29] there a man it didn't matter if the
[47:31] slave owner was still standing there or
[47:33] or shall we say symptoms were still
[47:35] there it had sounded and it was over
[47:38] with and nothing could put it back
[47:40] you know I I've had this laying in my
[47:42] office and I've referred to it many
[47:44] times and and I've got this over in
[47:46] Israel you know this is the ram's horn
[47:48] and this is something similar to what
[47:50] they would have over there in Israel no
[47:53] doubt maybe they'd have some bigger ram
[47:54] horns or whatever that they would play
[47:56] but once that that ram's horn had
[47:59] sounded there was nothing that could
[48:01] take the sound that had lift left there
[48:04] Amen this sound meant something it
[48:06] wasn't just a bunch of air being blowed
[48:08] through a trumpet but it had a meaning
[48:10] Amen and it had something I had a
[48:12] landing place and when it found that
[48:14] landing place there was nothing that
[48:16] could stop it from bring it to pass
[48:19] Amen I'll Bob just blow it if I've been
[48:21] wanting to blow it in church so I'll
[48:22] just do it right now that's our o you
[48:28] now try to take that sound and put it
[48:31] back in here you can't do it it's
[48:34] already been released it's already been
[48:36] spoken and there ain't nothing that can
[48:38] take it and put it back amen and I
[48:43] believe that we have heard messages
[48:45] after messages it was a jubilee trumpet
[48:48] sound and it was Amen the conflict
[48:50] between God and Satan it was armed and
[48:52] dangerous it was all of these sayings
[48:54] down they meant that down through every
[48:56] service God sounding the trumpet and
[48:59] they in a devil in hell that can make
[49:02] you take it back
[49:03] they need a devil in hell they can take
[49:05] the power away from them I don't care
[49:07] how many critics rise up and say it's
[49:09] this or that or whatever don't matter to
[49:11] me they cannot take it been put it back
[49:14] to what's been released to this church
[49:17] amen to the people that are here amen
[49:20] when this rock that was released this is
[49:22] a rock that was fat that I picked up in
[49:24] the very valley that David gathered
[49:26] stones that he meant when that rock was
[49:28] released from that sling and it was let
[49:30] go it wasn't a devil that could stop it
[49:32] goliath couldn't stop it there was
[49:34] nothing that can keep it from hitting
[49:36] his mark because it was released in the
[49:38] name of Jesus Christ and I believe that
[49:41] we have heard service after service
[49:42] after service and I want you to
[49:45] understand the devil can't do nothing
[49:47] about amen he's already released it it's
[49:50] a word that will not fail it will bring
[49:53] it to pass and they don't matter this
[49:55] morning if you still have symptoms we're
[49:57] going to deal with symptoms this morning
[49:58] but if you still have symptoms that
[50:00] means nothing if you still have stuff
[50:02] that's trying to hold on that don't mean
[50:04] nothing the sound has been given and
[50:07] released already amen
[50:11] sometimes a man he says in a vision of a
[50:14] to break forth and he said I'll say thus
[50:16] saith the Lord he said you better watch
[50:18] it then it's already happened thus saith
[50:21] the Lord you're healed in the name of
[50:23] Jesus Christ you're going to be well he
[50:25] said when that happens there ain't
[50:27] enough Devils in hell hallelujah what I
[50:32] want you to know we have thus saith the
[50:34] Lord for healing by His stripes I am
[50:37] healed I'm the Lord God that heals all
[50:40] other diseases we have thus sayeth the
[50:43] Lord
[50:44] so if we have thus saith the Lord ain't
[50:46] enough Devils that can keep her from
[50:48] coming to pass he said the woman will go
[50:51] home she'll feel good for a few days the
[50:54] life has gone out but he said the cancer
[50:56] that was there she'll feel good and
[50:58] going rejoicing the first thing you know
[51:00] corruption will set in he said what is
[51:02] it he said it's that little germ that
[51:04] was in there's cause that cancer he said
[51:07] the devil has went out but that thing is
[51:09] still there but she's healed but she
[51:12] just got to keep going home no matter
[51:14] and no matter how sick she gets she
[51:17] needs to still believe because nothing
[51:20] can change it amen she's bound to get
[51:24] sicker the whole thing begins to swell
[51:27] the first thing you know it gets worse
[51:29] she gets sick she gets a fever she gets
[51:32] down what's happening
[51:33] that thing is dying it is rotting amen
[51:38] congratulations if your symptoms have
[51:40] gotten worse that means that thing is
[51:42] dying hallelujah now either he goes on
[51:47] to say nay he said there are miracles
[51:50] that the thing just disappears he said
[51:52] but healing
[51:53] he said when that spirit is cast out
[51:55] that's that that body of that spirit is
[51:58] still there and it has to rot away and
[52:00] the symptoms may seem to get worse but
[52:03] just hold on a little bit the words
[52:06] already been released say man and they
[52:08] ain't enough Devils that can keep it
[52:10] from coming to pass hey man he says see
[52:15] Jesus said verily verily I say unto you
[52:18] not only this tree but if you say to
[52:20] that mountain be removed and don't doubt
[52:22] in your heart but believe what you said
[52:24] will come to pass these are all glory he
[52:27] said I like these meetings where we
[52:28] could just get together yes sir and say
[52:31] these words in my name they shall cast
[52:33] out devils we witnessed that in my name
[52:38] they shall cast out devils that's what
[52:40] he said that's what I believe that's
[52:43] thus saith the Lord in my name they
[52:46] shall cast out devils they shall lay
[52:48] hands upon their sick and they shall
[52:50] recover there's a devil exposed right
[52:54] there your cancer with that little pet
[52:56] name called cancer he's nothing but a
[52:59] devil and he said that little favor
[53:02] that's been bothering you
[53:03] it's a devil that's what the devil tries
[53:06] to do to all the time burn you up on
[53:08] something make you sicker when you're
[53:10] prayed for make you think you lost your
[53:13] experience with God he's lying to you
[53:16] [Applause]
[53:18] his time comes and when we have to stand
[53:21] on God's Word and we make Stan
[53:24] but when that time comes stand there
[53:26] because it's a never-failing word
[53:30] hallelujah there's got to be a time you
[53:33] got to separate yourself from your
[53:35] feelings in your faith the time is now
[53:40] let me go on he says sometimes when the
[53:43] evil spirit goes out of a person many
[53:45] times they don't realize it right then
[53:47] don't know what to do he said they don't
[53:49] some of them say oh I got sicker he says
[53:52] you're supposed to get sicker hello
[53:58] somebody says you're supposed to get
[54:00] sicker they don't know that he said but
[54:03] that growth that you're dealing with the
[54:04] doctor deals with he cuts it out but
[54:07] we're dealing with the life of that
[54:08] growth it's a devil he said that cancer
[54:11] the cancers are one of our great killers
[54:12] cancers has a life and if other life
[54:15] besides another life besides your life
[54:17] is growing spreading the Bible calls of
[54:20] the devil
[54:21] the cancer is called by a medical name
[54:23] but we know what it is it's a devil a
[54:25] tormentor he said a cancer when there's
[54:28] life was going out of the cancer it's
[54:30] Dan but the growth is still there unless
[54:33] a miracle is performed hey man will the
[54:38] growth hang in there no life in it
[54:40] it's death he said what would a piece of
[54:42] meat he said about that big in your
[54:44] bodies and in plain old southern way of
[54:46] speaking every southern 0kay play no
[54:49] southern way of speaking it about that
[54:51] big begin to rot in your body and that
[54:54] heart begins to beat and your blood
[54:56] things of blood through your bloodstream
[54:57] and it picks up that old dead substance
[55:00] of this cancers body it'll set in a
[55:02] fever
[55:03] you'll be sicker than ever you'll feel
[55:05] good the first 72 hours or so but then
[55:08] the body begins to corrupt he said but
[55:11] just hold on hey man hallelujah hope
[55:17] you're still holding on maybe some of
[55:20] you this morning your symptoms have
[55:21] gotten worse and you're thinking mom
[55:23] what's going on I thought I was healed
[55:25] you were healed and you'll stay healed
[55:28] as long as you'll believe that
[55:30] that's just that old devil Dino body
[55:33] that he was in it's corrupting his dawn
[55:36] it's wilted away why because it's a
[55:39] never-failing word God said so he said
[55:49] if a patient has something like a tumor
[55:51] or something of that order their patient
[55:53] will feel better right away but within
[55:55] about 72 hours they'll get sicker than
[55:58] ever was because the lump or whatever it
[56:00] was a lump that was in that than life
[56:02] that was in that lump is dead but the
[56:04] lump is still there and it begins to
[56:05] break up and the heart pumps the blood
[56:07] the blood / purifies the body it sets in
[56:10] the fever and sometimes they think oh I
[56:12] lost my healing he said why the faith
[56:14] that could take the life out of that
[56:17] tumor unbelief will bring it back again
[56:20] and there they'll lose their healing but
[56:24] he said hold on God will take care of it
[56:30] come on somebody hold on God will take
[56:34] care of it he said little boy here in
[56:36] the wheelchair you're blind sir you're
[56:38] laying on the cotton hold on to God's
[56:40] unchanging hand the devil might have bit
[56:43] you
[56:43] and maybe there's but there's enough
[56:45] drawing power in the Rock of Ages let me
[56:48] hide myself in there the devil can't get
[56:50] you when you're hitting their stick with
[56:52] it hold on to it don't let it away from
[56:55] you no matter how many symptoms appear
[56:57] how many this or that or the other hold
[57:00] on stay there until the healing power
[57:03] has drawn all of that disease away from
[57:06] you he will do it because he said he
[57:10] would but we're not to look at symptoms
[57:14] if you look to symptoms you're sure to
[57:16] be lost any man any time we look to the
[57:21] natural things always lost their victory
[57:25] we're not here where it where we're not
[57:27] even at work we're not to people but
[57:29] we're also a supernatural people hey man
[57:33] he's going to talk about symptoms he
[57:36] said of Jonah and the belly of the whale
[57:38] would have looked at symptoms he the
[57:39] first thing he was back slid and now
[57:42] he's bound hands and feet
[57:43] he was thrown out of the ship on a
[57:45] stormy sea and then a fish swallows him
[57:48] he goes down to the bottom begins to sit
[57:50] there maybe four or five miles deep
[57:53] Jonah back slid running from God hands
[57:55] tied behind him on a stormy sea five
[57:58] miles deep in the sea in a whale's belly
[58:00] if you look this way whales belly that
[58:02] way swells better than right up there as
[58:04] well belly maybe all you've seen this
[58:06] this week is arthritis or you've seen
[58:08] your hands or you seen your feet or
[58:10] you've seen this all you can see is that
[58:12] don't worry about that that's just
[58:14] symptoms there's already been a sound
[58:18] released hallelujah that's the symptoms
[58:22] they meant he reported Jonah said he
[58:25] said they're lying
[58:25] Vanity's and he turned away from what he
[58:28] could see with his natural eyes and he
[58:31] turned his eyes he said once more well I
[58:34] look towards your holy temple what had
[58:37] happened solemnly when he dedicated the
[58:39] temple it was a release of a sound he
[58:41] said when your people are in trouble if
[58:43] we look to this temple and pray they'll
[58:45] hear from heaven and he said if a man
[58:48] who was back slidden and running from
[58:51] God would have the ability to look away
[58:53] from the symptom how much more should
[58:56] have people feel with the Holy Ghost
[58:57] when I look away from the sickness and
[59:00] their trouble and turned their eyes not
[59:02] to a temple made with hands but to a
[59:05] cross hey man he said you'll hear from
[59:11] heaven hallelujah if not people be in
[59:15] trouble anywhere like that and look
[59:17] towards the Holy Temple and pray then
[59:19] hear from heaven and he believed that
[59:21] God heard Solomon's prayer how many
[59:27] believe God heard your prayers weekend
[59:30] or the minister they prayed for you he
[59:35] said if he could look towards the
[59:36] natural earthly temple through a prayer
[59:40] of an earthly man that had been prayed
[59:42] and believed that God heard it how much
[59:45] more ought you and I as Christians that
[59:49] may be bound with diseases look towards
[59:52] heaven where Christ sits on the right
[59:54] hand of God with his own blood making
[59:57] now for anything symptoms yeah you'll
[1:00:04] have them but they're lying vanities
[1:00:07] don't receive don't have nothing to do
[1:00:11] with it if you look at them you're
[1:00:13] looking away from God hey man we look at
[1:00:17] the unseen not what we can see no one
[1:00:20] can look at what they see and be a
[1:00:21] Christian you got to believe things that
[1:00:23] are unseen it's by faith you're healed
[1:00:27] not by sight or by feeling you're not

[1:14:46] was a man we know the story man by the
[1:14:49] name of John Ryan the fellow was blind
[1:14:52] in a meeting there in Fort Wayne coming
[1:14:54] to the meeting several thousand people
[1:14:56] about two nights before the piano played
[1:15:00] the great position now is near the
[1:15:01] sympathizing Jesus by the way when our
[1:15:04] piano went off that wasn't the Lord that
[1:15:06] was somebody hit the button but this was
[1:15:10] the Lord
[1:15:13] he's the sisters playing and she grazes
[1:15:16] her hands the piano continues to play
[1:15:18] the Great Physician now is near the
[1:15:21] sympathizing Jesus in the angel God in a
[1:15:24] world of world down in the room lies
[1:15:26] that and I thought a custodian to turn
[1:15:29] the light on me when I had a little boy
[1:15:31] in my arms and dropped him other girl
[1:15:32] Nazarene girl playing the tenth piano
[1:15:34] she jumped up started running and
[1:15:36] screaming she's seeing that little boy
[1:15:38] walk off the platform normal she had a
[1:15:41] reason to jump up and scream and just in
[1:15:45] case and I know they will critics are
[1:15:47] gonna see our jumping and screaming and
[1:15:48] they're gonna criticize don't criticize
[1:15:51] because you wasn't here
[1:15:54] there was a reason to jump and scream
[1:15:58] [Applause]
[1:16:08] I won't tell you right now they said
[1:16:12] well you're just going back to Pentecost
[1:16:14] well praise the Lord but the problem is
[1:16:18] they get Azusa Street and Pentecost
[1:16:20] mixed up we're going back to Pentecost
[1:16:25] back to the original and as far as I can
[1:16:28] understand and read all about it there
[1:16:30] was a bunch of jumping and screaming
[1:16:31] going on drunk people staggering out and
[1:16:38] people accusing them gonna be in there
[1:16:39] drinking some wine and they said what
[1:16:42] you mean this ain't the third out of the
[1:16:43] day we think the wine you're thinking
[1:16:45] about but this is that that the Prophet
[1:16:47] Joel spoke about and I'd like to tell
[1:16:50] whoever wants to watch it this is that
[1:16:52] that Peter spoke about this is that the
[1:16:56] Joel spoke about and listen I'll take
[1:17:00] that kind of atmosphere I'll take it
[1:17:03] everyday I'll take it every service
[1:17:06] because I seen what that atmosphere
[1:17:08] produces I've taken atmosphere jumping
[1:17:11] in screaming if it produces a little
[1:17:12] girl that was bound by fear so horribly
[1:17:15] she didn't even want to leave her house
[1:17:17] unto where she can be set free I don't
[1:17:19] take an atmosphere and take a hold of my
[1:17:21] wife and take all the redness away from

[1:18:08] that's what I
[1:18:17] it's the same atmosphere that gave a
[1:18:20] black man back his side that didn't
[1:18:26] happen right there but it was said right
[1:18:28] there hello come on somebody

[1:18:45] the Lord had been released the word had
[1:18:48] been spoken and it didn't matter how
[1:18:50] long C word and the Word of God is not
[1:18:53] captured by time he's not in the
[1:18:59] boundaries of time this word goes beyond

[1:21:40] barber who refused to hear God's Word

[1:23:28] this is what Miriam did when she played
[1:23:31] the tambourine she still saw symptoms

[1:23:38] side of the Red Sea God said your enemy
[1:23:40] you'll see no more forever on the other
[1:23:42] side and said they saw them floating in
[1:23:44] the Red Sea but God knew that the enemy
[1:23:50] that they would see wasn't the same
[1:23:52] enemy he's a dead enemy therefore he has
[1:23:56] no power to pick up a whip no more
[1:23:58] he has no unction to say a word no more
[1:24:01] he has nothing left the dirty can't do
[1:24:03] nothing Florida God amen just because
[1:24:09] that you got the symptoms and Miriam saw
[1:24:11] the symptoms but she began to praise God
[1:24:13] but it wasn't too many moments later he
[1:24:19] was at the bottom of the Red Sea and
[1:24:21] there wasn't a sign of him left hallelu
[1:24:28] Amen what happens he says the devil to

[1:26:01] did for you one day he says a devil
[1:26:05] might have tied you up to that thing he
[1:26:07] said but there's a good man Jesus Christ
[1:26:09] who redeemed you who cut every string
[1:26:12] loose from you when you see the rest of
[1:26:16] them rise into your feet and believe it

[1:26:56] symptoms a pastor will pray for them
[1:26:58] they'll go over so I don't seem to be
[1:27:00] any better
[1:27:00] that's not healing symptoms sometimes
[1:27:02] gets worse he said one of the greatest
[1:27:05] scarecrows the devil's got immense
[1:27:07] symptoms just has nothing to do with it
[1:27:09] because God said so that's the Scarecrow
[1:27:11] the symptom
[1:27:12] he said there's anything ever had a case
[1:27:14] of symptoms it was Jonah he had a bad
[1:27:16] symptom back slid hands tied behind the
[1:27:19] belly of the whale deep in the ocean

[1:27:28] belly but he said they're lying vanities
[1:27:30] and I'm not gonna look at them no more

[1:28:01] know who plot like that he's there he's
[1:28:03] a real devil they're there your name
[1:28:06] might be pinned on he might've wrote
[1:28:08] your name there

[1:28:11] anything but refused to say it say by
[1:28:14] his stripes I'm healed testify which
[1:28:18] means say the same thing if I testify in
[1:28:21] court saying and there's something
[1:28:22] another I got to say the same thing that
[1:28:24] I sing testify means to say the same
[1:28:27] thing God said that's what he was doing

[1:29:03] was God God in Christ reconciling them
[1:29:05] self it worked himself but he never used
[1:29:07] any of his gifts he brought the kingdom
[1:29:10] of God so low that the weakest Christian
[1:29:14] could use it when Satan comes he said if
[1:29:16] thou be but jesus said is written if
[1:29:18] thou be jesus said it was written he
[1:29:21] used the word of God to defeat him it's
[1:29:23] written God promised me I could go to
[1:29:26] church and the pastor not me with all
[1:29:28] pray for me and I was pray for that's
[1:29:30] exactly what God would say what happened

[1:29:34] refuse to have whatever the devil said
[1:29:36] it's
[1:29:37] written I'm gonna walk on in my healing
[1:29:40] because it's written it's written in the
[1:29:43] Bible your healing it's written here
[1:29:47] hallelujah it's already written it's
[1:29:49] there as Jesus would take what was
[1:29:51] written and defeat Satan you also take
[1:29:54] what's written the Brandon would talk
[1:30:05] about the young boy that was killed in
[1:30:07] Finland this is one of the things that
[1:30:11] so gripped me as I would ever first
[1:30:13] heard this story said he told about it
[1:30:15] for years
[1:30:16] I thought that was amazing brother
[1:30:19] brother Wayne talking about talking to
[1:30:21] somebody about this very story and him
[1:30:25] saying well it didn't happen like that
[1:30:26] and this and the man wasn't even there
[1:30:28] so how can you testify of something you
[1:30:32] didn't see so anyway by the way he's one
[1:30:37] of them backslidden preachers but anyway
[1:30:40] he but LeBron was say he was hit wrote
[1:30:44] it for two years to put it on the
[1:30:46] Flyleaf or your Bible it's gonna happen
[1:30:48] and before he knew it he was standing in
[1:30:52] the vision and not even realizing it and
[1:30:56] one of the brothers had walked up to the
[1:30:58] accident and he's like come back and
[1:31:00] just crying and just but Brandon who's
[1:31:02] not gonna believe this this boy is just
[1:31:05] mangled it's it's terrible he said it
[1:31:09] just tears me up cuz I also got a son
[1:31:11] over there his man was telling brother
[1:31:13] Brandon brother Brandon walks up there
[1:31:16] and he looks at the little boy and he
[1:31:19] said there was something familiar about
[1:31:21] him he said but I couldn't place and he
[1:31:24] said I turned around beginning to walk
[1:31:27] back to my vehicle and he said a hand
[1:31:29] grabbed a hold of me and he said I
[1:31:32] turned and when I turn I looked and I
[1:31:34] saw those lapping rocks and that
[1:31:36] hillside and all the things he said then
[1:31:38] he hit me I knew I was standing in that
[1:31:40] vision he said when I knew where I was
[1:31:44] standing he said you could lay it line
[1:31:47] ever devil up in hell
[1:31:49] and it could not keep it from coming to
[1:31:51] pass as hearing him this morning and why
[1:32:00] upended why I think Pentecost failed he
[1:32:02] said he said there's a fundamentalist
[1:32:04] and the Pentecost he said one knows they
[1:32:06] both have checks we said one knows
[1:32:08] there's a power there but they don't
[1:32:09] know who they are one knows who they are
[1:32:11] but they don't believe the powers there
[1:32:13] he said if we could ever get those two
[1:32:15] together he said we would see the
[1:32:17] miraculous take place hello somebody
[1:32:21] I thought the miraculous was taking
[1:32:24] place but now we got somebody that also
[1:32:29] knows this is who they are and not only
[1:32:32] do they know who they are they know
[1:32:34] there's power there to bring the pass
[1:32:37] what is spoken and if we could ever get
[1:32:40] those thing that time is now for the
[1:32:43] phenomenal for the miraculous why is the
[1:32:47] time now because now we're standing in
[1:32:49] the vision it's already been written
[1:32:55] I'll have a bride without spot without
[1:32:58] wrinkle it's already being written they
[1:33:00] shall lay hands upon the sick and they
[1:33:02] shall recover it's already been written
[1:33:05] amen we're now standing where the
[1:33:07] prophecy was spoken and you can lie
[1:33:11] never gave up you can let that listen
[1:33:15] Satan is trying to bring his line up the
[1:33:17] best he's got alone brother Wayne said
[1:33:18] it he's trying to bring the best he's
[1:33:20] got into this age he's on capped Hill
[1:33:23] and brought thousand times thousands
[1:33:25] what is he trying to do to keep these
[1:33:27] people from realizing because he knows
[1:33:30] the last time those people realized here
[1:33:33] he'll was shook up on the day of
[1:33:36] Pentecost when there was a people that
[1:33:38] realized hey we're standing in what was
[1:33:41] written he said going to Jerusalem and I
[1:33:44] wouldn't do you with power on high it
