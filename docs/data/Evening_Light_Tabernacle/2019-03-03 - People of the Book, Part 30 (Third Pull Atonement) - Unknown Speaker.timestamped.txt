[44:28] Matthew chapter 17 and we're going to
[44:31] read from the fourteenth verse as we
[44:34] just welcome you today in the name of
[44:37] Jesus Christ welcomed his presence amen
[44:41] Matthew chapter 17 and verse 14 and when
[44:46] they were come to the multitude there
[44:49] came to him a certain man kneeling down
[44:51] to him and saying lord have mercy on my
[44:55] son for he is a lunatic in his vexed for
[45:00] oftimes he falls into the fire and oft
[45:03] into the water and I brought him to thy
[45:06] disciples and they could not cure him
[45:09] and they then jesus answered and said o
[45:14] faithless and perverse generation how
[45:17] long shall I be with you how long shall
[45:20] I suffer with you bring him hither to me
[45:24] and Jesus rebuked the devil and he
[45:27] departed out of him and the child was
[45:30] cured from that very hour then came to
[45:33] the Sipos to Jesus apart and said why
[45:36] could not we cast him out and jesus said
[45:39] unto them because of your unbelief for
[45:42] verily I say unto you if you have faith
[45:44] as a grain of mustard seed you
[45:48] say to this mountain remove hence to
[45:51] yonder place and it shall remove and
[45:54] nothing shall be impossible unto you and
[45:58] Peter callin to remember and saith unto
[46:01] Him master behold the fig tree which
[46:04] thou curses is withered away and jesus
[46:07] answered and said unto him have faith in
[46:10] God
[46:11] verily I say unto you that whosoever
[46:14] shall say unto this mountain be removed
[46:17] to me thou Casson to see then but shall
[46:21] believe that those things which he set
[46:22] shall come to pass you will have
[46:25] whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto
[46:28] you whatsoever things you desire when
[46:30] you pray believe that you receive them
[46:32] and you shall have them and that reading
[46:35] was from mark 11 21 through 24 god bless
[46:39] you you can be seated
[46:43] we'd find here that Jesus is speaking
[46:47] about a greater faith I think this is
[46:51] something that the disciples would often
[46:54] ask of Jesus Lord increase our faith and
[47:00] Jesus is speaking of a greater faith and
[47:03] because it mustard seed faith is a faith
[47:07] that is small but yet grows into a great
[47:10] tree and this last day it's a day of a
[47:14] lot of unbelief and if there ever was a
[47:17] day that we need faith it's this day
[47:20] that we're living in a man we need to be
[47:23] able to believe God for his promises
[47:25] especially when we're looking here at
[47:27] the end time and knowing that the
[47:29] rapture of the church is near in the
[47:32] return of Jesus Christ and it's going to
[47:34] take faith to change us in a moment in
[47:38] the twinkling of an eye as we as we see
[47:42] today that is it's often like it was in
[47:46] that day when Jesus was dealing with a
[47:48] very faithless generation at the closing
[47:52] of the Jewish dispensation and that day
[47:56] was very simpler the symbol too similar
[47:59] to our day
[48:00] where that people have got away from the
[48:02] word and just living by the tradition of
[48:05] the elders and certainly we would hope
[48:09] that we would never get to be that way
[48:11] where we would get away from believing
[48:14] God's Word and - and then just accepting
[48:18] traditions of the elders where we formed
[48:21] dogmas and put in our own doctrine that
[48:23] really isn't in the Bible it's really
[48:26] important to stay with the Full Gospel
[48:28] in this day and men be able to preach
[48:31] the full Word of God as Paul would say
[48:34] to Timothy preach the word be on stannum
[48:38] season and out of season a rebuke and
[48:41] with all long-suffering and doctrine it
[48:44] is very important today that the Word of
[48:47] God is preached or we'll never have
[48:49] faith now so we must keep as our
[48:53] absolute the Word of God and our and of
[48:56] course that's the Bible isn't it hey man
[48:59] we've got to keep that as our absolute
[49:01] it must be what we can put our faith
[49:04] upon is the Word of God that no matter
[49:07] what your experience even if whatever it
[49:11] tells you if it isn't if it tells you
[49:14] that the Bible isn't true that the power
[49:17] of God that was there with the Apostles
[49:20] the prophets and teachers as a pastor
[49:21] the gifts of the Spirit isn't the same
[49:24] as it was when it flowed through the
[49:26] Apostles at Pentecost then there's
[49:28] something wrong with your absolute you
[49:30] have to go back to the type host of the
[49:33] Word of God and stead of tired to a
[49:35] denominational Creed a man because he
[49:38] said heavens and earth will pass away
[49:40] but my word will never pass away so you
[49:45] got to watch what your absolute is and
[49:48] this day an hour we have but one
[49:50] absolute that we must can only trust in
[49:53] and that's the infallible Word of God
[49:56] now we can we can look in our our nation
[50:01] and the natural here around us and see
[50:04] that you know where our pilgrim fathers
[50:07] came here for freedom of religion and a
[50:10] Constitution was formed Gary
[50:13] see our liberties and that Constitution
[50:16] was to be the nation's absolute but
[50:20] today that the Constitution is no longer
[50:23] the nation's absolute as democracy as a
[50:28] democracy America is no longer has its
[50:31] anchor in its constitution today we have
[50:35] elected a leadership who determined to
[50:38] bring a forced equality called socialism
[50:41] and our service today certainly isn't
[50:44] about politics but I'll tell you when
[50:46] you see the desire of the world and you
[50:51] know and the nation that rises in a
[50:54] population now rising among us who does
[50:57] not know the the origins of this country
[51:02] and why that we are here and that is
[51:05] that we can serve God and worship Him
[51:08] and freedom and with liberty we see the
[51:12] rise of this green New Deal that the
[51:14] Democratic Party is pushing and let me
[51:17] just say we're not Democrats neither are
[51:19] we Republicans here we're Christians
[51:21] a man's over this isn't again it's not
[51:25] about politics is about ethics is about
[51:27] what things that are happening in our
[51:29] world today but it's easy to see that we
[51:33] have a world today that is under the
[51:36] Laodicean spirit that they are their
[51:40] Christ rejecters in that crisis on the
[51:42] outside of the church and they that come
[51:46] to the point where we're rich and
[51:47] increased in goods and have need of
[51:49] nothing and yet II would say them yet
[51:51] you are wretched and miserable and poor
[51:54] and blind and naked this is a condition
[51:58] of this last age but Laodicea meaning
[52:01] people's rights or the justice of the
[52:03] people we've never seen an age quite
[52:06] like this where that here in this last
[52:09] church age all nations are rising up
[52:12] demanding equality socially and
[52:16] financially and everybody is to be
[52:19] brought together on the same
[52:22] it's the same plane financially and
[52:24] socially and in every way it's is a day
[52:27] where you know according to our liberal
[52:30] theologians even that Jesus was a
[52:33] socialist and the early church and the
[52:36] guidance of the Spirit practice
[52:38] socialism and thus we ought to do today
[52:41] and so you see it is because there is a
[52:45] complete desire that is in the hearts of
[52:48] a man of man died about one world
[52:51] government for everything to be peace
[52:54] and everything to be equal and everybody
[52:58] have the same well I'll tell you it's
[53:01] not going to happen under politics no
[53:03] matter who you vote in the only way that
[53:06] this is going to happen is far the king
[53:09] of kings and the Lord of lords to the
[53:11] converse Lord of your life and then king
[53:14] of this earth look at the Millennial
[53:16] range and come in and then there will be
[53:18] peace on the earth then there will be
[53:21] justice and equality but nothing that
[53:24] man can do can bring that to pass
[53:26] everybody bit of it is false promises
[53:30] now so yeah but today it's a day an hour
[53:34] where we want to make everything one you
[53:36] know the church the state religious
[53:38] religion and politics coming together it
[53:41] shows you the end time where the tares
[53:44] are all being bound together but it
[53:48] ought to tell us if the terrors are
[53:50] being bound the weed is about ready to
[53:52] be gathered into the garner what a day
[53:56] that will be now you know Laodicea was a
[53:59] city of earthquakes we're speaking of
[54:02] this being replaced in Revelation 3:15
[54:06] were where he tells us of Laodicea being
[54:09] the last Church eh and it was a city of
[54:12] earthquakes and earthquakes
[54:14] finally destroyed it and this age will
[54:18] end in God shaken the whole world the
[54:23] whole world that has gone off to to love
[54:26] in love with the old harlot system in
[54:29] the world
[54:30] some that will all crumble but the very
[54:33] earth will be shaken and then renovated
[54:36] for a millennial reign hey man what a
[54:40] day an hour that is that we're looking
[54:43] for do we realize right here as we speak
[54:47] today as we just deal with this for a
[54:50] moment how close we are in the endtime
[54:52] process do we see America risin up like
[54:57] a lamb in in Revelation chapter 13 and
[55:01] then begin to speak as a dragon do we
[55:05] see the heart of the people begin to
[55:07] change more and more and more evil until
[55:10] there's no conscience left in our nation
[55:12] and in our world where we can we can
[55:14] kill the unborn where we can destroy
[55:18] little babies in the wounds and then
[55:21] people will applaud that how awful that
[55:26] is in our age in our time the people
[55:29] that are supposed to be a nation under
[55:31] God but you know again we we find in
[55:36] this unity and this oneness you realize
[55:38] in February most of us as missus in the
[55:42] news the Pope and the most important
[55:44] even of the Sunni Muslims signed a peace
[55:47] pact together as they prepared for a one
[55:50] world religion in the Pope and the grid
[55:53] the grand Eamon signed its historic
[55:56] declaration of fraternity calling for
[55:59] global peace between nations and
[56:02] religions and races in front of an
[56:05] audience a global audience of religious
[56:08] leaders from Christianity Islam Judah
[56:11] Judaism and other face don't you realize
[56:14] where we're at church we're at the time
[56:16] they're about ready to crown them and
[56:19] out of Christ they're about ready to get
[56:22] that anyone on one world religion and
[56:25] bring it all down to to the endtime
[56:27] prophecies being fulfilled but before
[56:30] that time you've got to be ready to
[56:32] leave here
[56:33] there's a rapture coming for the Church
[56:35] of Jesus Christ and you've got to be
[56:38] prepared for it and that's why we're
[56:40] here today we're not here to talk
[56:42] politics we're not here to talk about
[56:44] about even all this the social evils in
[56:47] the world but we are here talking about
[56:49] how we can prepare to be that people of
[56:53] faith here in this endtime who will have
[56:56] that overcoming faith and overcome and
[56:59] power to rise above Satan burglar and
[57:02] sin and unbelief now the Bible tells you
[57:07] very clearly in the Book of Daniel about
[57:09] the kingdoms of this world he would see
[57:12] it as as a great image that he would see
[57:17] and it would be a head of gold and then
[57:20] go down into lesser-quality metals until
[57:23] it finally comes down to the feet and we
[57:26] would see that it would be babbling and
[57:28] then the kingdom of give away to Medes
[57:32] and Persians and then to the Greek and
[57:34] I'm to Rome and then iron in the clay
[57:37] which comes right down to Romanism and
[57:39] communism together but I want you to
[57:42] remember that when it reached the feet
[57:45] as it comes down to the end the Bible
[57:48] said daniel said I saw a stone that was
[57:53] cut out without hands hey man this is
[57:57] not a man-made government this is not a
[58:00] man-made power amen but this is God's
[58:03] own power
[58:04] striking the feet of that that image and
[58:07] all the kings of the world would crumble
[58:10] and then that stone would become a great
[58:12] mountain
[58:13] oh brother I'll tell you this for this
[58:17] is promised all the wicked and the
[58:19] atheists and the agnostics and the
[58:21] modernists and the Liberals that will
[58:23] all be there to be destroyed here in
[58:26] this end time but there's going to be a
[58:28] people missing that's the bride of Jesus
[58:31] Christ you and I need to be prepared to
[58:35] meet the Lord now of course this there
[58:41] is not just the tears that are being
[58:44] gathered but there is also the
[58:47] that has been gathered and of course
[58:51] that this gathering will be a physical
[58:54] translation out of disease and to do
[58:58] that will require that there be a people
[59:01] who will give the word preeminence and
[59:07] that the word would have the headship in
[59:09] other words it means more to them than
[59:12] what everybody else is saying than what
[59:16] the world is the Korean is is right or
[59:18] wrong in but they give the word of God
[59:21] the preeminence and let the word of God
[59:24] be what is right and call what is right
[59:27] right and wrong wrong hey man now all my
[59:32] friends to do this we got to be returned
[59:34] to the original atomic and that's where
[59:39] we're at to come back to the atonement
[59:42] of the blood to see Christ in his whole
[59:46] power a men took make it word that there
[59:50] is nothing impossible with you a man to
[59:56] bring you into that place of faith
[59:59] whether your faith is operating as a son
[1:00:02] or daughter of God I'd like I'd like
[1:00:05] just to paraphrase Matthew four chapter
[1:00:08] 4 where Jesus ministered from place to
[1:00:11] place throughout all the problems of
[1:00:13] Galilee and he taught in the synagogues
[1:00:16] preaching the hope of the kingdom realm
[1:00:19] and healing every kind of sickness and
[1:00:22] disease among the people his fame spread
[1:00:26] everywhere many people who were in pain
[1:00:30] and suffering with every kind of illness
[1:00:33] were brought to Jesus for their healing
[1:00:36] epileptics paralytics and even those
[1:00:39] tormented with and will by demonic
[1:00:42] powers were all set free than die I like
[1:00:45] the way it concludes it
[1:00:46] everyone who was brought to Jesus was
[1:00:50] healed
[1:00:52] and I don't want to say today all that
[1:00:55] we might get men to Jesus because
[1:00:59] everyone that is brought to Jesus is
[1:01:02] healed this is a God who is a healer who
[1:01:08] can take you out of you your sinful
[1:01:10] state and make you a son of God who can
[1:01:13] take you out of your broken health and
[1:01:15] heal you and bring deliverance oh that
[1:01:19] we can get you to Jesus
[1:01:21] oh that we can have Jesus in our mets
[1:01:24] this morning as a healer I deliver and
[1:01:28] people have a faith that will operate
[1:01:31] and bring down that very presence of God
[1:01:34] into the church where everybody brought
[1:01:38] to Jesus is delivered I can look at you
[1:01:42] I can look at many of you and I can
[1:01:45] remember the day where you were brought
[1:01:48] to Jesus and when you got into his
[1:01:51] presence hey man when you got into his
[1:01:54] presence you were healed
[1:01:57] you were delivered your life has never
[1:02:00] been the same now I'm just gonna go back
[1:02:04] just historically just for a little bit
[1:02:06] as we as we speak about some things this
[1:02:10] morning I just want to speak about some
[1:02:13] things that were that we're at in this
[1:02:16] time in this hour you know in 1946 an
[1:02:21] angel of God came to William Branham and
[1:02:25] and there he told him that he was
[1:02:29] commissioned by God to go and carry a
[1:02:31] gift of divine healing to the world and
[1:02:34] this is part the great divine healing
[1:02:36] revivals and that happened in the 1940s
[1:02:39] and the 50s it would be the same man
[1:02:43] that in his in his meetings that as he
[1:02:46] would preach that there would be men and
[1:02:50] women that would stand up and prophesize
[1:02:52] speak in tongues and say else john the
[1:02:56] baptist was sent to forerun the first
[1:02:58] coming of christ you are sent with a
[1:03:01] message to 4-run the second coming of
[1:03:03] christ
[1:03:04] um you know there he would go out and
[1:03:08] and there would be a divine healing move
[1:03:11] that would be sparked it would be other
[1:03:13] great men that would get inspiration it
[1:03:16] would be all Roberts that would meet him
[1:03:18] after the service one day and then talk
[1:03:21] to him and say do you believe that God
[1:03:23] would hear my prayers it would be if it
[1:03:27] would be men like you know other great
[1:03:30] men of God that in that era of time that
[1:03:32] also would give the spark from that
[1:03:36] meetings and ends where they was seeing
[1:03:38] God do his work in anonymity
[1:03:43] showing his healing power and His grace
[1:03:47] amen but then then we come nine years
[1:03:50] later in the year 1955 it had been nine
[1:03:55] years since the angel of God it appeared
[1:03:57] and since william branham two 4runners
[1:04:00] coming starting out with a gift to
[1:04:02] divine healing and showing the same
[1:04:04] power of the original atonement now to
[1:04:07] begin with the divine healing movement
[1:04:10] was was embraced and welcomed by all the
[1:04:14] Pentecostal denominations and especially
[1:04:16] by the Assembly of God but by 1955 the
[1:04:21] denominations were now withdrawing their
[1:04:23] support mainly due to financial reasons
[1:04:28] because even though William Branham was
[1:04:31] not after money and would make that
[1:04:32] clear would not let them beg or plead
[1:04:34] for money in his campaigns and once he
[1:04:37] took enough offerings to pay for the
[1:04:39] expenses of meeting he could take in
[1:04:40] offerings because he was afraid of three
[1:04:44] things he said that always got a
[1:04:45] preacher which was money women in
[1:04:48] popularity and knowing that he was
[1:04:51] raised support man and that money would
[1:04:54] not be as weakness he wouldn't even look
[1:04:56] at it but he would have his managers to
[1:04:59] take care manage they expense and and
[1:05:01] the men that was helping him in the
[1:05:03] meetings that he paid to go along to
[1:05:06] help set up the meetings and so on while
[1:05:08] he prayed and waited on God for for the
[1:05:11] his for the prayer lines and praying for
[1:05:15] the sick but
[1:05:17] 19:55 now there was so many emulators
[1:05:21] and impersonators that the field was now
[1:05:25] crowded with divine healers and they
[1:05:29] used the promise of healing to lure to
[1:05:32] take money from the people and some of
[1:05:36] them would would report said I know when
[1:05:38] it's God's will for me to move on and
[1:05:40] that's when I'm taking up offerings and
[1:05:43] I begged and I told him and then he said
[1:05:45] I literally take him up and shake him up
[1:05:48] and down until until all the pennies
[1:05:50] fall out of their pocket then I know
[1:05:52] it's time to move on to another meeting
[1:05:54] and that became the emphasis of the
[1:05:59] divine healing movement by and large was
[1:06:03] how much money we can get out of the
[1:06:05] people instead of pointing to the
[1:06:08] atonement and the power of God bringing
[1:06:11] souls to Christ the emphasis changed the
[1:06:15] kingdom building now let me tell you of
[1:06:19] course this would cause the
[1:06:21] denominations to get jealous of this
[1:06:23] money they wanted for themselves and for
[1:06:25] their churches and to build up their you
[1:06:28] know their their little kingdoms of man
[1:06:30] in this age of impersonate this is an
[1:06:34] age of impersonation like as the Bible
[1:06:37] said as Janice and generous wizard Moses
[1:06:40] Janice and Jeffrey's you know would come
[1:06:43] after the true prophet of God and they
[1:06:45] would use gifts for they were gifting
[1:06:48] and I met Moses throw down his rod and
[1:06:51] become a servant they threw down rods
[1:06:53] and they become a serpent they were
[1:06:55] gifted a man and Satan can't create they
[1:06:59] were using gifts of God but their
[1:07:02] purpose was to keep them an Egyptian
[1:07:05] bondage rather than to bring them into
[1:07:08] the freedom amen the key visual as
[1:07:12] slaves this was their purpose it was not
[1:07:15] to bring a Liberty even sassette keep
[1:07:17] them in the same all to bondage that
[1:07:20] there always was a man that God wants
[1:07:23] his people to be free
[1:07:25] a man God wants his people to be able to
[1:07:28] move in the spirit he wants to be able
[1:07:30] to work among them he wants to make them
[1:07:33] into sons and daughters of God he wants
[1:07:36] to equip them with power with an
[1:07:38] anointing a man he wants them to be able
[1:07:41] to live overcoming lives he wants to be
[1:07:44] the Holy Ghost in your life and your
[1:07:46] leader and your guide
[1:07:48] he doesn't want some preacher leading
[1:07:50] and guide you he wants the Holy Spirit
[1:07:52] to be the one with preeminence in your
[1:07:54] life that's what God wants the
[1:07:59] impersonators would crowd the field
[1:08:01] during this divine healing movement
[1:08:03] riding on his coattails they claim the
[1:08:07] biggest tenth the most healings the
[1:08:10] largest crowds the greatest miracles the
[1:08:14] largest magazines with the most
[1:08:16] subscribers and this is what it all
[1:08:19] became about now should we be shocked
[1:08:27] today when we come down here where we're
[1:08:30] at in time and we see even today there
[1:08:34] impersonators rising wanting to be the
[1:08:36] prophet coming with their own
[1:08:38] revelations outdone the Prophet where
[1:08:41] they've become more gifted than he more
[1:08:43] intellectual with better clarity more
[1:08:45] able to bring revelation than the very
[1:08:48] messenger that God would send you see
[1:08:52] Paul would say it once I'm gone there
[1:08:56] are going to be previous wolves that
[1:08:58] will come in and they'll not spare the
[1:09:01] flock once I'm going they'll come and
[1:09:04] they'll claim equal revelation for their
[1:09:07] purposes not to help you but destroy you
[1:09:09] and this became the goal of many that
[1:09:12] would rise up in Paul's day and would
[1:09:15] stand there claiming greater revelation
[1:09:18] than what Paul had can you imagine paul
[1:09:22] the apostle of jesus christ with
[1:09:25] revelation and then even before she said
[1:09:27] i am forced to boast i'm forced to tell
[1:09:31] you I too am an apostle I've met the
[1:09:34] Lord
[1:09:34] many among the road to Damascus III have
[1:09:37] been there in the depths of the sea
[1:09:39] three days a night I've been whipped
[1:09:41] I've been dealt
[1:09:42] ii-i've had miracle in signs and wonders
[1:09:45] of all as he said you're forcing me to
[1:09:48] have to boast to be able to prove my
[1:09:51] Apostleship because why by now there was
[1:09:56] so many rising up impersonating Paul
[1:09:59] bringing revelations until he when he
[1:10:03] would say of Jaime Gnaeus and philetus I
[1:10:06] had turned him over the demo because
[1:10:09] they're saying the resurrection is past
[1:10:11] and Paul it speak to he had preached a
[1:10:14] spiritual resurrection that we are
[1:10:17] resurrected in Christ a man that we are
[1:10:21] that we have risen with Christ and who
[1:10:23] sit with him in heavenly places and he
[1:10:26] preached that but here it comes for
[1:10:28] leaders and high media so long and what
[1:10:30] are they doing they are they are coming
[1:10:33] with a greater revelation and now
[1:10:35] because this has happened to us and we
[1:10:38] are now in the in the resurrection and
[1:10:40] we are now already seen it happen and
[1:10:43] we're risen with Christ that now there's
[1:10:45] not going to be the resurrection of the
[1:10:47] Dead it's all over and it's all finished
[1:10:50] we're beyond it we're past sounds all
[1:10:54] too familiar
[1:10:57] amen
[1:10:59] the Paul would say I haven't shunned to
[1:11:01] declare to you the gospel of God in Acts
[1:11:05] chapter 2 and verse 27 28 now take heed
[1:11:09] therefore unto yourself and all the
[1:11:12] flock over which the Holy Ghost has made
[1:11:14] you overseers to feed the Church of God
[1:11:18] which he had purchased with his own
[1:11:21] blood
[1:11:22] for I know this that after my departing
[1:11:25] shall Grievous wolves enter in among you
[1:11:28] not sparing the flock and also of your
[1:11:32] own selves shall arise men arise
[1:11:34] speaking perverse things which that's
[1:11:37] their own ideas of their own word and
[1:11:39] not God's to dwell away disciples after
[1:11:43] themselves notice this started in early
[1:11:47] hey man you see Satan it was enough for
[1:11:51] him to discredit the resurrection it
[1:11:54] wasn't enough for him to come along and
[1:11:56] say that stole away his body and they
[1:11:59] paid off you know everybody just to say
[1:12:02] that give this report it wasn't enough
[1:12:05] to spread lies upon it deny that he had
[1:12:09] risen from the dead but now here it is
[1:12:11] he comes along and he comes even in the
[1:12:14] church itself many men rising up with
[1:12:17] perverse things and men their own ideas
[1:12:20] and not God's words to draw look at the
[1:12:23] Berbers to draw away disciples after
[1:12:27] them therefore watch and remember that
[1:12:34] I've bought the space in three years I
[1:12:36] ceased not to warn every night and day
[1:12:40] with tears and now brethren I commend
[1:12:43] you to God and to the word of His grace
[1:12:46] which is able to build you up listen
[1:12:49] what is it that is able to build you up
[1:12:51] the word come on a man and to give you
[1:12:55] an inheritance among all of them which
[1:12:57] are sanctified what is it that's able to
[1:12:59] give you an inheritance the word that's
[1:13:03] why we've got to come back to the word
[1:13:05] in his full power my mountain-moving
[1:13:09] faith faith that were that and that is
[1:13:13] tree-killing faith I'm a mountain-moving
[1:13:16] faith a faith that was once delivered to
[1:13:19] the Saints of faith that Jesus said we
[1:13:21] ought to every one possess amount but
[1:13:26] you see these days they all crowd the
[1:13:29] field he's trying to be the greatest in
[1:13:31] their revelatory nonsense
[1:13:34] Menten child a revelation of the Godhead
[1:13:37] and say that Jesus is just a man and not
[1:13:40] even God can you imagine that you know
[1:13:43] the Pharisees accused Jesus of being a
[1:13:46] man who made himself God he was
[1:13:50] crucified for that reason
[1:13:52] him being a man made us have God but it
[1:13:56] wasn't that at all he was God who made
[1:13:58] himself a man a man God came down into
[1:14:02] human flesh and gave His life and
[1:14:05] redeemed us by the blood are you with me
[1:14:08] others have a revelatory non sense of
[1:14:12] the own the mercy-seat saying they're in
[1:14:13] the mercy seat and God's chosen places
[1:14:16] of worship and there's no mercy but
[1:14:18] except of course in their group they
[1:14:21] claim the power remitting retaining sins
[1:14:23] and both to be able to cast those who
[1:14:26] disagree with them in the outer darkness
[1:14:29] my goodness that ain't nothing to brag
[1:14:31] about
[1:14:33] Amen oh my when our attitude becomes
[1:14:36] toward another because of a disagreement
[1:14:39] and we'll cast you into outer darkness
[1:14:41] I'll tell you one thing I'm glad God
[1:14:45] doesn't give power to sinful men because
[1:14:48] that's sinful men amen the desire of
[1:14:51] every true Christian is that all would
[1:14:54] be safe even jesus said it's a set of
[1:14:57] him God so loved the world he gave His
[1:15:01] only begotten Son that whosoever
[1:15:03] believeth on him should not perish but
[1:15:07] have everlasting life for he came not to
[1:15:10] condemn the world but that all the world
[1:15:13] through you might be saying well god
[1:15:16] help us to have the spirit of Jesus then
[1:15:19] will not condemn everybody else we want
[1:15:22] to see every men safe God don't lose a
[1:15:25] one of them that's so that's something
[1:15:28] ought to be a burden of this church his
[1:15:30] Lord helped me to speak to some soul
[1:15:33] help me help me find somebody that I
[1:15:36] just listened just for a moment that we
[1:15:38] can lift their burden that we can bring
[1:15:40] him in the present like I said a while
[1:15:41] ago all that we we might get men to
[1:15:44] Jesus because why today the emphasis is
[1:15:54] on give them to church and church can't
[1:16:01] save you
[1:16:02] and we didn't get to the church but oh
[1:16:06] if we can get you in God's presence and
[1:16:10] that's where the responsibility of a
[1:16:13] group like dancers bring such an
[1:16:15] atmosphere that it welcomes the Lord
[1:16:19] Jesus and he comes down in our midst
[1:16:22] because when he is here darkness leaves
[1:16:25] the light turns old demons or expelled
[1:16:29] darkness leaves Alleluia and people who
[1:16:34] once walked in darkness see a great
[1:16:36] light and blinded eyes come open and
[1:16:39] healing begins makes a man a real man
[1:16:43] and a woman a real lady makes sons and
[1:16:46] daughters out of those who were lost and
[1:16:49] undone this is the gospel and we imagine
[1:16:58] today when things become so
[1:17:01] Spiritualized until the actual rapture
[1:17:05] and the literal and physical return of
[1:17:07] Jesus is even mocked can we imagine a
[1:17:13] day and time where this is no longer our
[1:17:16] expectancy the time of the delay that
[1:17:20] Peter spoke about we said in the end
[1:17:23] time there would be mockers rise
[1:17:25] scoffers Satan where is the sign of his
[1:17:29] coming and people are going on as if
[1:17:34] things are going to continue on forever
[1:17:35] and every every sign every corner when
[1:17:41] God's got warning signs and flagman out
[1:17:44] with waving a red flag saying is coming
[1:17:47] to them and they go right on through it
[1:17:53] now so you see Church we're here in the
[1:17:58] time where were that that we we must
[1:18:02] keep our expectancy on the return of the
[1:18:06] Lord Jesus because that is the greatest
[1:18:09] hope of the hour without that we've lost
[1:18:12] everything so our whole focus ought to
[1:18:15] be on Lord come back for us
[1:18:19] whatever you do don't leave us here
[1:18:23] darkness is coming on the world and evil
[1:18:27] is rising in every way that we can look
[1:18:30] socially economically spiritually it's
[1:18:33] evil give him worse and worse and worse
[1:18:35] the day is getting darker as we go along
[1:18:40] every generation gets worse as I was
[1:18:44] saying even about our Constitution and
[1:18:47] and things you know them the Millennials
[1:18:49] the millennialist they are speaking
[1:18:51] about today you know that they they
[1:18:55] never they never fought a war they don't
[1:18:58] know anything about what it took to make
[1:19:02] this country what it is they have no
[1:19:04] they have no idea of the sacrifices that
[1:19:08] have been made to afford them this
[1:19:10] freedom and now they're ready ready to
[1:19:12] sell it off into socialism into
[1:19:15] communism can you imagine what a day
[1:19:18] that we're living in but over what an
[1:19:20] hour we ought to be friends when we when
[1:19:23] we everyone have the opportunity to meet
[1:19:27] the same Christ you see they cannot and
[1:19:31] we cannot today go back and meet our
[1:19:33] Pilgrim Fathers and we can't go and meet
[1:19:36] a John Quincy Adams or Thomas Jefferson
[1:19:38] or somebody letter tell us what this
[1:19:40] Constitution meant what we stood for how
[1:19:43] we fought for it and our principles but
[1:19:46] I tell you that may not be true about
[1:19:48] right here as Americans but I'll tell
[1:19:51] you as Christians every one of us can
[1:19:54] have that dress and up-to-date
[1:19:56] experience and meet Jesus Christ for
[1:19:58] ourselves and here might be a historical
[1:20:01] God but a present it's God
[1:20:04] [Applause]
[1:20:06] and there's no excuse there's no excuse
[1:20:14] because once you ever meet him then you
[1:20:18] know his deliverance power is what he
[1:20:21] wants to give you know his healing
[1:20:24] powers what he wants to church to have
[1:20:26] you'll know his saving power a man in
[1:20:30] his keepin power a man is what he wants
[1:20:34] to give the church amen
[1:20:36] this is what he wants remember Jesus
[1:20:39] answer to them said have faith in God
[1:20:44] this is a word that we got to have in
[1:20:47] this day have faith in God you cannot
[1:20:51] have faith in politics you cannot have
[1:20:54] faith even in the religions of this
[1:20:56] world there's only one thing our faith
[1:20:59] is gonna be anchored in and that's God
[1:21:02] hey man notice he said for I say unto
[1:21:07] you that whosoever shall say unto this
[1:21:11] mountain he wants to bring a people in
[1:21:14] the mountain-moving faith be removed and
[1:21:20] be thou cast in the sea shall not doubt
[1:21:23] in his heart but shall believe those
[1:21:27] things which he saith shall come to pass
[1:21:30] now Jesus is telling us some very key
[1:21:34] things here first of all he said
[1:21:37] whosoever that means that power is open
[1:21:41] to every one of his children it's not
[1:21:43] just for preachers it's not for bishops
[1:21:46] it's not proposed it's for whosoever are
[1:21:49] you one of them this morning then it is
[1:21:51] for you whosoever whosoever shall say to
[1:21:57] this mountain amen now Jesus was looking
[1:22:04] at a literal mountain but let me tell
[1:22:07] you something you got mountains in your
[1:22:10] life
[1:22:11] there's things that needs to be removed
[1:22:14] things that you've been dealing with
[1:22:16] that you shouldn't have to deal with
[1:22:18] something in your way you can't get
[1:22:20] through but I'll tell you this God wants
[1:22:24] to give people mountain-moving faith a
[1:22:27] man that will move out the hindrances in
[1:22:30] your life I mean we have down too long
[1:22:33] with sickness we've got too long with
[1:22:36] sin we've let them death too long and I
[1:22:39] love demon powers to control our lives
[1:22:42] control our families it's time that we
[1:22:44] realize who we are as sons of God amen
[1:22:48] that God gets given whosoever moms are
[1:22:52] moving faith if I can get you to say if
[1:22:57] you'll start speaking to your mountain I
[1:23:01] mean in your hearts quit letting down
[1:23:04] when yeah I know every time that you try
[1:23:09] to stand up for the word of God that
[1:23:11] begins to come and fight against you but
[1:23:14] I'm trying to say to you this Lord with
[1:23:16] allowing doubt to win and start ahead in
[1:23:20] your faith rise up and when over doubt
[1:23:23] wins it Satan's unbelief ever become
[1:23:26] greater than God's Word my doubt is
[1:23:30] Satan's unbelief when sure that you be
[1:23:33] given more preeminence and in your mind
[1:23:36] in your heart
[1:23:38] Satan's word should never have
[1:23:40] preeminence you're a believer a man
[1:23:44] Satan's word I've no right to have
[1:23:47] preeminence in you you need the Word of
[1:23:50] God is a high preeminence now so
[1:23:55] whosoever shall say to this mountain be
[1:23:57] thou removed and be thou cast in the sea
[1:24:01] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[1:24:03] shall believe that those things that he
[1:24:06] saith shall come to pass in man he shall
[1:24:10] have whatsoever he saith now you're
[1:24:16] either gonna believe this or rip it out
[1:24:18] of your Bible
[1:24:21] we're either going to take it and
[1:24:23] believe it's the Word of God or we're
[1:24:26] just gonna say it's for another
[1:24:27] generation it's not for us take it out
[1:24:29] of my Bible there's got to be a people
[1:24:33] in this day race a rapture an hour
[1:24:35] there's got to be a people with rapture
[1:24:37] and faith hey man
[1:24:40] somebody that I believe is word a man
[1:24:43] that whatsoever things you decide hey
[1:24:47] man you when you pray believe that you
[1:24:50] receive them and ye shall have them hey
[1:24:57] man oh god he's lifting up something to
[1:25:00] us in the word this morning a man that a
[1:25:04] people start believing God because when
[1:25:08] we get into his presence things begin to
[1:25:10] happen are you with me now a man now so
[1:25:14] as we're as we're speaking on this let
[1:25:16] me just go down for a moment because you
[1:25:20] know when when william branham thought
[1:25:22] about this scripture this marked 1122 if
[1:25:27] you say to this mountain if you ask what
[1:25:29] you will it shall be given to you and
[1:25:33] you begin to think about it he and he
[1:25:35] thought first soon as it's out now you
[1:25:38] know because like us all he dealing with
[1:25:41] his own I'm believing his own doubting
[1:25:44] well somebody asked me about the
[1:25:46] scripture I just have to say it was
[1:25:48] before the atonement was given and so
[1:25:53] you know then because of that it's not
[1:25:56] in the atonement and he's sitting there
[1:25:59] thinking about that as he was
[1:26:02] contemplating it as something as he
[1:26:06] began to think about it and he and God
[1:26:09] began to speak to him
[1:26:11] and so what about these miracles and
[1:26:15] things that has happened in your
[1:26:16] ministry you think it was you doing that
[1:26:19] do you think it was your own power
[1:26:21] what no then he was God's power through
[1:26:24] the atonement
[1:26:26] and then he then he spoke out loud said
[1:26:28] if the person now I want you to get this
[1:26:31] if the person through the atonement
[1:26:34] sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:26:37] can live in such a sphere with God so
[1:26:42] close that he can be so wrapped so
[1:26:45] completely in God by the blood of Jesus
[1:26:48] that it wouldn't be him talking it would
[1:26:51] be the Holy Spirit speaking these things
[1:26:56] hallelujah can you imagine a people so
[1:26:59] under the atonement so much under the
[1:27:03] blood Amen that God is just using their
[1:27:06] lips to speak to them because they
[1:27:09] become an extension of his of his power
[1:27:12] through His grace can you imagine how
[1:27:15] two people a person through the
[1:27:17] atonement sanctified by the blood of
[1:27:20] Jesus I wonder do we realize where we
[1:27:23] stand who have received the blood of
[1:27:25] Jesus do we realize that we are
[1:27:28] sanctified we are cleansed that there's
[1:27:31] not one sin a man that we stand before
[1:27:35] him justified there he sees us because
[1:27:40] like we were in his mind before the
[1:27:44] world ever began and he sees us without
[1:27:48] spot or without wrinkle or without a
[1:27:50] blemish so that you through that blood
[1:27:53] can come boldly before the throne of
[1:27:56] grace to find help in your time of need
[1:27:59] how many needs help this smaller man
[1:28:03] well I'll tell you there is a place of
[1:28:04] help and that's before the throne of
[1:28:07] grace were that you can come in boldly
[1:28:12] under the mud under the atonement a man
[1:28:17] and with such a spear so full with God
[1:28:20] so close so wrapped completely in God by
[1:28:25] the blood of Jesus is not you talk him
[1:28:27] any more it be the Holy Spirit speaking
[1:28:30] out of you a mouth now listen when Jesus
[1:28:38] was on the earth
[1:28:40] he walked upon the earth He healed the
[1:28:43] sick he cleanse a leopard he cast out
[1:28:47] Devils by word is that the truth by a
[1:28:52] word he would do that
[1:28:54] everywhere he went he conquered now
[1:28:59] we're saying we're in his kingdom and
[1:29:01] we're sons and daughters of God then
[1:29:04] we're living beneath our privileges
[1:29:06] because everywhere Jesus went from
[1:29:10] Hoonah a man there was deliverance it
[1:29:13] was brought and that's the way it ought
[1:29:16] to be in the Church of God a man than
[1:29:19] ever where his bride goes everywhere his
[1:29:21] church goes there's deliverance
[1:29:24] hey mom now
[1:29:27] I just like to read you some scripture
[1:29:29] here about it Matthew chapter 8 verse 16
[1:29:32] when the evening was come they brought
[1:29:36] unto Him many that were possessed with
[1:29:38] devils and he cast out the spirits with
[1:29:42] his word and healed all that verse it
[1:29:49] let's go back over that again I think we
[1:29:52] may have glossed over it they brought
[1:29:55] unto Him many that were possessed with
[1:29:58] devils and he cast out the spirits how
[1:30:06] with his word now isn't this the same
[1:30:11] thing he did to the victory with his
[1:30:14] word he spoke to the big tree in the
[1:30:17] life left it isn't this what he said
[1:30:20] that would happen to the mountain with
[1:30:22] the word if you say to this mountain be
[1:30:26] thou removed so Jesus not only was
[1:30:31] telling his disciples then that you know
[1:30:35] that day had mountain-moving faith that
[1:30:38] if you just got the faith of a grain of
[1:30:40] mustard seed
[1:30:41] if that mustard see the phasors planet
[1:30:44] it'll grow into a mighty tree man it'll
[1:30:48] be a mighty faith
[1:30:50] and that be the move mountains that prey
[1:30:54] that casts out Devils that faith oh my
[1:30:58] that faith will bring healing to the
[1:31:00] sick that faith will work in God's
[1:31:03] people everywhere that faith is applied
[1:31:07] that peace will even work for your lost
[1:31:09] loved ones
[1:31:10] oh man that faith we'll go out and find
[1:31:13] them where they're at in the darkest
[1:31:16] dungeons of Satan's hell and bring a
[1:31:18] black to Christ that's the power of
[1:31:25] believers prayer words they say he sent
[1:31:33] his word and healed them he cast out the
[1:31:40] demons and spirits with his word and
[1:31:44] healed all that were sick with his word
[1:31:49] not didn't didn't the the Roman
[1:31:52] centurion have a revelation of that hey
[1:31:57] man he come down and said you know my my
[1:32:01] servant is sick and and it's dying come
[1:32:04] and pray for our you know would you
[1:32:07] would you pray for me he said I'll come
[1:32:08] to your house
[1:32:09] he said no there's no need to come to my
[1:32:12] house
[1:32:12] just speak the word now he it might have
[1:32:18] been miles to his place and didn't
[1:32:20] matter how far these words travel and
[1:32:23] spirits on the Holy Spirit every man and
[1:32:27] right there would go right there to the
[1:32:29] very place where his servant was laying
[1:32:32] there dying and the word would rebuke
[1:32:36] the devil that held him bound and be
[1:32:39] healed so he said look I'm a man I'm the
[1:32:43] man of authority I'm a man of authority
[1:32:46] i I know how this works I I don't go
[1:32:49] myself I send this cat this one in here
[1:32:52] and this from there these legions here
[1:32:54] and these there to go out and do do the
[1:32:56] bidding I just speak the word and it
[1:32:58] gets done said I know you're a man of
[1:33:00] authority
[1:33:01] and all you've got to do is speak the
[1:33:04] word and they and my servant Illya now
[1:33:10] that was a Gentile heaven faith it's
[1:33:14] about time we come to realize with the
[1:33:15] gentiles that it was speaking about
[1:33:19] gentiles having faith mark 1:22 and they
[1:33:26] were astonished at his doctrine I want
[1:33:28] you to look at this and we pride
[1:33:31] ourselves sometimes in having the
[1:33:33] correct doctor men will go to great
[1:33:38] extents preaching great sermons great
[1:33:41] depths and great understanding and you
[1:33:44] know that Wow's you with their intellect
[1:33:46] oh how they put this together and put
[1:33:50] that together and most of the time is a
[1:33:52] cow in the top of the tree eating grass
[1:33:54] when they get all their picture drawn
[1:33:57] it's very phenomenal and the Bible said
[1:34:03] and they were astonished at his doctrine
[1:34:06] why for he taught as one that had
[1:34:10] Authority and not as the scribes now his
[1:34:15] doctrine was different wasn't it and
[1:34:18] there was in their synagogue a man and
[1:34:21] with unclean spirit and he cried out
[1:34:23] saying let us alone what have we to do
[1:34:25] with these out Jesus under that Jesus of
[1:34:27] Nazareth are thou come to destroy so I
[1:34:30] know the who thou art the Holy One of
[1:34:32] God and Jesus rebuked him saying hold
[1:34:35] thy peace and come out of him and when
[1:34:38] the unclean spirit had torn him and
[1:34:40] cried with a loud voice he came out of
[1:34:43] him and they were all amazed in so much
[1:34:49] that they questioned among themselves
[1:34:50] saying what thing is this what new
[1:34:55] doctrine is this for with authority
[1:34:59] commandeth he even the unclean spirits
[1:35:02] and they do obey him now this is what
[1:35:07] the doctrine of Jesus anew
[1:35:12] hey man we want to preach true doctor
[1:35:15] knowing doctrine without this Authority
[1:35:18] is not his doctor
[1:35:19] it's just doctor this man made ideas but
[1:35:23] when you get the doctor to Jesus that's
[1:35:27] what we want to preach the doctrine of
[1:35:29] Jesus we've had enough doctor the man of
[1:35:35] Jesus will command even I clean spirits
[1:35:48] do you know people come down to the
[1:35:50] altar and leave with her same old dirty
[1:35:52] lust spirit and their same old drinkin
[1:35:55] spirit and their same Oh cigarette
[1:35:57] spirit and their same old dumb spirit
[1:35:59] going right along with them and it come
[1:36:02] down the altar for prayer go right back
[1:36:04] the same way they are that's not the
[1:36:06] doctrine of Jesus man the doctrine of
[1:36:10] Jesus though your sins be as scarlet
[1:36:12] there will be white as snow though they
[1:36:15] be red like crimson they shall be white
[1:36:18] as wool as far as the East is from the
[1:36:20] West I will remove your sins from you
[1:36:23] that's the doctrine of Jesus Jesus fills
[1:36:31] you with his own holy spirit that
[1:36:34] empowers you to live a life for victory
[1:36:36] and penalize over soon
[1:36:39] that's the doctrine of Jesus man and you
[1:36:44] cannot talk to teach the doctrine of
[1:36:46] Jesus without having and using the
[1:36:48] authority of Jesus too many today we're
[1:36:53] saved we're seeing people saved in their
[1:36:55] sins and not from their sins let me tell
[1:37:03] you when you get in his presence he will
[1:37:06] not leave you the way he found you you
[1:37:12] will be forever changed you can get in
[1:37:16] church and leave out the same old sinner
[1:37:19] you came in but you ever get in Christ
[1:37:22] one time just get in Christ all things
[1:37:26] have passed away and behold all things
[1:37:29] have become new you cannot be the same
[1:37:33] person anymore your chains in his
[1:37:35] presence
[1:37:37] amen so the soui
[1:37:40] he said well they said what new doctrine
[1:37:43] is this for with authority commandeth he
[1:37:48] even the unclean spirits and they do
[1:37:51] obey Him this something is very soon
[1:37:57] that was said of every believer and
[1:37:59] these signs shall follow them that
[1:38:03] believe in my name I'm leaving you in my
[1:38:08] stead for you to act in my name and in
[1:38:13] my name you shall cast out Devils a man
[1:38:17] you will heal the sick you speak with
[1:38:21] new tongues if you take up serpents it
[1:38:24] shall not harm you hey man come on dude
[1:38:28] this is the Word of God this is the word
[1:38:30] the last words that Jesus spoke and he
[1:38:33] taught and his words had authority and
[1:38:37] we are not preaching the words of Jesus
[1:38:40] unless the authority of Jesus
[1:38:42] accompanies the words
[1:38:44] a man was everywhere he went he
[1:38:48] conquered a man everywhere you go your
[1:38:52] to conquer your son of God the daughter
[1:38:55] of God in His image in his likeness come
[1:38:57] on you know that species brings forth
[1:39:00] species it's the law of God that
[1:39:03] everything bring forth of its kind
[1:39:05] humans bring forth humans dogs read more
[1:39:08] dogs cats bring forth cats come on
[1:39:11] but I tell you we're preaching about a
[1:39:13] new birth and when you're born of glob
[1:39:16] God brings forth God's sons of God then
[1:39:22] the image of God people that know their
[1:39:24] God and do exploits they stand on that
[1:39:29] word they declare it to be the truth he
[1:39:34] didn't say you had the power he said you
[1:39:36] had the authority you say it I'll do it
[1:39:41] whatever you bind on earth I'll bind it
[1:39:44] in heaven whatever you loose on earth
[1:39:47] I'll loosen in heaven these are the
[1:39:49] words of Jesus that all will be art
[1:39:51] words today we ought to be taking God's
[1:39:54] words as our word there were sons of God
[1:39:57] we're of his species
[1:39:58] we're of his genis come on of his genis
[1:40:02] of his kind now everywhere Jesus went he
[1:40:08] conquered a man he conquered everything
[1:40:11] that could be conquered he conquered
[1:40:13] passions pride sickness Devils when he
[1:40:18] died he conquered death when he rose he
[1:40:22] conquered hell oh man he went up and
[1:40:25] conquered everything that was against
[1:40:27] mankind and when did the red wine press
[1:40:30] of God and crushed it down and conquered
[1:40:32] death hell and the grave sickness
[1:40:34] formalities everything he overcome it
[1:40:37] and rose again on the third day and
[1:40:39] conquered all the atmospheres above and
[1:40:42] cut that mist between God and man and
[1:40:44] connected heaven together again
[1:40:48] through Christ you have a connection
[1:40:51] back to heaven through Christ you have
[1:40:54] the power to rule older as a son of God
[1:40:58] hey man there is tens of mighty conquer
[1:41:02] since he ripped that veil into he's got
[1:41:05] the keys of death and hell on my side he
[1:41:08] says fear not a man I am he that was
[1:41:12] dead but behold I am alive forevermore
[1:41:15] and I've got the keys of death and of
[1:41:18] Hell hey man there he was he raised said
[1:41:22] don't fear I'm the first and the last so
[1:41:28] therefore he cut ever obstacle between
[1:41:30] God and human beings that they might be
[1:41:33] connected like they were in the Garden
[1:41:35] of Eden a man you there again you know
[1:41:40] this does make chunky but man
[1:41:43] then is omnipotent anywhere his faith
[1:41:49] can work it's all power everywhere that
[1:41:53] he operate as a son of God omnipotence
[1:41:57] goes to work that omnipotence will cast
[1:42:01] out Devils that omnipotence gives you
[1:42:04] power to live an overcoming life usually
[1:42:07] brother Tim I got I'm a Christian and
[1:42:10] I've had this habit and I can't overcome
[1:42:12] it let me tell you friends you ever get
[1:42:14] a real drink to the Holy Ghost overcome
[1:42:18] and power will be on the inside of you
[1:42:20] and because that overcoming power there
[1:42:23] you overcome that thing you'll rise up
[1:42:25] above it it'll come underneath your feet
[1:42:28] you are not meant to be conquered you
[1:42:31] were met and ordained to be a conqueror
[1:42:36] hey Matt a man fully surrendered to
[1:42:40] gardeners omnipotence if he can
[1:42:43] surrender his mind to God let the mind
[1:42:46] that was in Christ be enough he gets a
[1:42:49] render his mouth his mind his body his
[1:42:52] vessel any time he can surrender to God
[1:42:54] there's a nepeta a man sea supreme faith
[1:43:01] makes you omnipotent it would take
[1:43:05] omnipotence to move a mountain
[1:43:09] come on only God can move a mountain you
[1:43:12] know you can't just stand there and say
[1:43:15] that mountain be moved all on your own
[1:43:17] but as a son of God under the influence
[1:43:21] of God under the anointing of God hey
[1:43:26] man
[1:43:26] now remember what brother Branham said
[1:43:28] those words I originally about a moment
[1:43:31] ago about it all being their Toolman and
[1:43:33] and he said when I said that a super
[1:43:37] anointing came over me man brother when
[1:43:42] we begin to agree with the word say what
[1:43:45] the word said declare our super
[1:43:47] anointing comes down a mount now so what
[1:43:54] have you saved with that creative power
[1:43:56] of an appearance knowing God promised
[1:43:59] and he said in a word it creates a power
[1:44:01] that goes out yonder and brings things
[1:44:04] that pass things that is not and makes
[1:44:07] them as though they are because to
[1:44:09] omnipotence is Matt how did to
[1:44:11] omnipotence meet when your faith and man
[1:44:15] rises there to that level of the promise
[1:44:18] that significance and God coming down in
[1:44:21] anointing that faith that significance
[1:44:23] and doing that begin to speak there's a
[1:44:26] power goes out and something happens a
[1:44:29] man this is why he would say to John
[1:44:33] don't fear a little flock
[1:44:34] don't fear John I all that I am your air
[1:44:38] - oh my
[1:44:41] our sewers my nipples is yours as I
[1:44:46] stand in your midst notice if he's not
[1:44:50] in our mitts we're just a dead church
[1:44:53] we're just a dressed up bejeweled corpse
[1:44:57] a man but it's still a corpse no matter
[1:45:01] how pretty you make the building man
[1:45:03] matter how wonderful you make the singer
[1:45:05] if God ain't in it
[1:45:06] we're just a dead church but when God
[1:45:10] comes down diffidence begins to work
[1:45:13] cancers begin to cast out demons we get
[1:45:17] the free hallelujah that's what we want
[1:45:27] to see is an impotent speakin power
[1:45:33] because why faith has been placed in God
[1:45:40] notice he would say my Nipponese is
[1:45:45] yours as I stand in your midst brother
[1:45:50] this is why we declare he's right here
[1:45:53] in this last age right here in the
[1:45:55] middle of this church standing in the
[1:45:58] midst of his golden candlesticks right
[1:46:00] here in the last stage he said I'll
[1:46:03] never leave you and I'll never forsake
[1:46:05] you I say what I promise I say what a
[1:46:09] work that is
[1:46:20] I'll tell you we can feel this spirit
[1:46:22] lift in the world lifting the nice and
[1:46:25] lifting society lifting families lifting
[1:46:28] out the churches but all God when you
[1:46:30] lift up from this earth take me with you
[1:46:34] because I don't want to be here when
[1:46:36] Satan is the king of this earth for in
[1:46:39] rains for that short time in the
[1:46:41] tribulation I don't want to be here all
[1:46:47] my power is given to you and it's yours
[1:46:51] to use
[1:46:52] you speak the word and I'll perform it
[1:46:56] that's my covenant and they can never
[1:46:59] fail it's time we start using the word
[1:47:04] against our enemy time we start standing
[1:47:07] up for what's right speaking against
[1:47:09] what's wrong men he would say we are so
[1:47:14] thankful to be on speaking terms the
[1:47:18] blood of Jesus Christ puts us in this
[1:47:21] condition think about that that's what
[1:47:25] the blood have the blood positions you
[1:47:28] it positions you in a place where you're
[1:47:31] on speaking terms that whatever you ask
[1:47:35] in my name I will do it is that his word
[1:47:40] a man is either the truth or isn't it
[1:47:43] rude somebody's gonna believe it might
[1:47:46] as well be you might as well be you
[1:47:49] listen listen even even brother Branham
[1:47:52] would say himself I'm your brother
[1:47:54] standing as your brother and then a
[1:47:56] saucer try my best to hold you before
[1:48:00] God and I'm standing right here before
[1:48:03] the white throne now and pointing my
[1:48:06] finger to that bloody sacrifice there
[1:48:09] and speaking through his name that is
[1:48:12] done it has to happen
[1:48:15] and that's the way we all stand we're
[1:48:18] pointing to a bloody sacrifice will play
[1:48:21] pointing to one who paid our debt a man
[1:48:25] paid our dues we don't know the devil of
[1:48:28] things Satan has no claim on us we do
[1:48:32] not belong to him we're not his children
[1:48:35] we're not his subjects he's not our God
[1:48:38] he's not our King and we're not his
[1:48:41] slave and I'll tell you it's time we
[1:48:44] quit acting like we're still a slave of
[1:48:46] the devil and realize we're people put
[1:49:07] to the white throne a man toward that
[1:49:11] bloody sacrifice there speak in his name
[1:49:14] is done a man ma that ought to be
[1:49:21] something we do because he's there to
[1:49:26] make the intercession for us he's a high
[1:49:29] priest that can be touched by the
[1:49:33] feelings of our infirmities which means
[1:49:36] he empathizes with you not sympathizers
[1:49:41] he's been through it himself he walked
[1:49:43] the earth with you a man he met the
[1:49:47] devil himself and everywhere that he met
[1:49:50] him he cast him out does that tell you
[1:49:54] what your job is to do a man ever where
[1:49:58] you meet the devil cast him out a man
[1:50:01] because this is where he promised I'll
[1:50:03] be there with you even in you to the end
[1:50:05] of the world now so he is there as a
[1:50:09] high priest that can be touched by the
[1:50:12] feelings of our infirmities our only
[1:50:15] intercessor between God and man is Jesus
[1:50:18] Christ
[1:50:19] now that's according to the Bible you
[1:50:21] might have others to try but there's
[1:50:24] only one that God's hears and that's
[1:50:26] Jesus Christ our prayers go through him
[1:50:30] hey Matt don't you believe a lie that
[1:50:33] Jesus is and I our intercessor anymore
[1:50:35] and it's um now now some group of people
[1:50:37] it is she is him but he is not her I
[1:50:42] hope you heard that she is him but he is
[1:50:47] not her amen don't confuse the roles
[1:50:51] he's the Redeemer where the redeemed
[1:50:54] he's the Savior we're the same hey man
[1:50:57] he's the healer come on we're just we
[1:51:00] dis act in his name hey man you see she
[1:51:04] we cannot do his work his work is the
[1:51:07] atonement her work is faith in the
[1:51:10] atoning so God has a work the bride has
[1:51:14] a work Jesus is saying my father workers
[1:51:17] and I work at hitherto we ought to be
[1:51:19] the same builders say my father worker
[1:51:21] than we work as hitherto hey man how is
[1:51:24] it he paid the price we just go and
[1:51:27] collected everything back from Satan hey
[1:51:30] man we go take the spoils he bound the
[1:51:33] strongman we just go into the house and
[1:51:36] get everything that was ours and take it
[1:51:38] back man that's why the church ought to
[1:51:41] be doing today a man is following Jesus
[1:51:43] our captain who who bound us from one
[1:51:47] someone greater than Satan someone
[1:51:52] greater than Satan someone stronger than
[1:51:55] Satan came up bound his house I'm
[1:51:58] quoting you from the Bible he came and
[1:52:01] he bound his house
[1:52:03] someone beggar someone stronger is your
[1:52:06] Jesus greater is he stronger did he find
[1:52:10] him did he pay the price did he bind him
[1:52:13] better with his death at Calvary
[1:52:16] and then the devil is found and all you
[1:52:19] got to do is go and collect the spoils
[1:52:21] don't get back what the devil stole from
[1:52:24] you three bestowed your joy go get it
[1:52:26] back if he stole your peace go get it
[1:52:29] baby stole your children go get it back
[1:52:32] whatever the devil stole you get it back
[1:52:35] from him trap oh you ever saw a button
[1:52:42] not a slave you don't have to take
[1:52:45] another beating from help you don't have
[1:52:48] to be another time weapon you are free
[1:53:03] [Applause]
[1:53:05] and take problems
[1:53:08] [Applause]
[1:53:22] he's the waterpocket see look all
[1:53:25] diseases that's here to deliver the
[1:53:28] savior hey man your needs supplier
[1:53:35] hallelujah
[1:53:37] sure we're to intercede on the behalf of
[1:53:40] others
[1:53:41] hey man that's what prayin is all about
[1:53:44] believers interceding through prayer
[1:53:48] about a need but the bride isn't the
[1:53:50] intercessor there's only one that God
[1:53:53] hears and that's Jesus Christ and we
[1:53:56] approach God through his sacrifice and
[1:53:59] through him he hears us hey man you see
[1:54:03] you deny the body that's the atonement
[1:54:06] the sacrifice you denied the body the
[1:54:10] blood or the word you're dead the minute
[1:54:13] you do it and that's what Satan wants to
[1:54:16] see it to us to do today is deny the
[1:54:19] body deny the atonement deny who we are
[1:54:23] in Christ deny the the the power of that
[1:54:29] blood that makes us tongue in its
[1:54:31] presence as a son of God so when you
[1:54:35] deny the body the blood the word of
[1:54:37] Jesus Christ you're dead the minute you
[1:54:40] do it Satan's got you you see again it's
[1:54:45] God's chosen place of worship where he
[1:54:47] puts his name not in the church but in
[1:54:50] his son now it was under the power of
[1:54:54] the blood the atonement that Moses
[1:54:58] created let's you think of that per
[1:55:04] minute
[1:55:05] Moses created Moses took with words
[1:55:12] created are you with me hey man he
[1:55:18] called for flies and flies Kings he
[1:55:22] called for frogs and probes came
[1:55:26] any man he called for darkness and
[1:55:28] darkness came he called for light to
[1:55:31] take over the darkness and light came
[1:55:33] whatever Moses folk got back backed it
[1:55:36] up now friends that was not even under
[1:55:41] the atonement of Christ that was under
[1:55:44] the Tollman of blood and bulls of bulls
[1:55:46] and goats hey man so tell me which is
[1:55:49] greater the blood of Christ or the blood
[1:55:52] of bulls and goats so the blood the
[1:55:56] blood of a looking to looking to the
[1:56:02] sacrifice of Jesus put a man named Moses
[1:56:06] on speaking terms
[1:56:07] and Moses created with that word a man
[1:56:14] so now the power above bulls in the
[1:56:17] blood of bulls and goats gave power to
[1:56:21] Moses to go out there by the commission
[1:56:24] of God stretch out his rod and say let
[1:56:27] her come flies you see had the word of
[1:56:31] God he spoke that word when he did it
[1:56:34] came from God's thought forward is
[1:56:37] assault expressed and so God thought it
[1:56:42] and put it in Moses mind now friends let
[1:56:47] me just tell you God taught it and he's
[1:56:50] written it right here in the Bible amen
[1:56:54] and you can read it and it comes in your
[1:56:57] mind a mouth
[1:57:01] now Moses started God thought of me and
[1:57:04] Moses come in Moses mind put it Moses
[1:57:08] mind call for prize
[1:57:11] he called for 5ko for a cover for
[1:57:17] plagues to come and he called him one by
[1:57:19] one Colonel turn to a Nile into blood
[1:57:22] and it would all turn to blood he did
[1:57:26] that under the power of the blood of
[1:57:29] bulls and goats which has no power today
[1:57:33] because it's all fulfilled in Christ you
[1:57:36] sacrifice all the animals you want to
[1:57:38] and it
[1:57:39] not produce anything it was only looking
[1:57:41] to a greater lamb coming so Moses Moses
[1:57:46] there spoke and now it becomes a word
[1:57:48] now what
[1:57:50] once it's spoken it's a word and once it
[1:57:55] becomes a word it's released and once
[1:57:58] it's released
[1:57:59] Moses turn around maybe there wasn't a
[1:58:02] fly in the country and the hours from
[1:58:04] them you know maybe one old green fly
[1:58:06] began to buzz around and a half an hour
[1:58:10] there was maybe ten pounds per square
[1:58:12] yard what was it the creative word of
[1:58:15] god that was spoke by the lips of a
[1:58:17] mortal man and Jesus is saying the same
[1:58:21] thing to you take the word place it on
[1:58:25] your lips you tell me you tell me well
[1:58:29] what is his sword the Word of God you
[1:58:34] tell me what the book of Revelation says
[1:58:36] where it's held it is mouth you see the
[1:58:45] sword cannot stay on your side in your
[1:58:48] scabbard as a decoration you're a
[1:58:52] soldier and it's got to come out of the
[1:58:57] scabbard amen I'm spoken with your lips
[1:59:01] put in your mouth and you begin to speak
[1:59:05] what God said first thing you need to be
[1:59:08] is starting to speak in what God said
[1:59:10] about you I am a son of God I have been
[1:59:14] bought with the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:59:16] amen I am the righteousness of God in
[1:59:18] him amen I have his peace man I have his
[1:59:23] authority he's commissioned me he sent
[1:59:26] me to the earth at this time I'm here
[1:59:28] for a reason and for a purpose I'm here
[1:59:30] to serve God in the service command and
[1:59:33] now I've got a situation here
[1:59:35] I take dominion over it you you need to
[1:59:39] get up in the morning look in the mirror
[1:59:41] and say I'm a blob washed
[1:59:43] black box summer order of the Living God
[1:59:47] and I am here to torment Devils I am NOT
[1:59:51] here to be tormented by Devils I am here
[1:59:54] to get the devil a hard time
[1:59:56] that's lovely as I'm here on this earth
[2:00:01] that's what I'm here for
[2:00:03] I'm here to overcome I'm here to rise up
[2:00:06] above I'm here to meet the challenges
[2:00:09] I'm here to defeat the devil anywhere by
[2:00:12] the word anywhere any place any time
[2:00:16] because that's what God called a people
[2:00:19] to do people that's in his image and his
[2:00:21] likeness now God could use some air you
[2:00:24] know God uses men that's how he uses he
[2:00:27] said I'm the vine you are the branches
[2:00:28] the branches bears the fruit not
[2:00:31] deveined that right when he came here he
[2:00:34] was he was the first branch that came
[2:00:37] out of the mind and he did the works
[2:00:39] through God he said he that believeth on
[2:00:42] me the works said I do shall he do also
[2:00:44] amen so then you become you become the
[2:00:48] the branch now then he's expecting you
[2:00:51] to bear fruit and he said anything they
[2:00:55] ain't bad fruit he said he purchased it
[2:00:57] then I'll bring forth more fruit so the
[2:01:00] very thing the purging that you're going
[2:01:02] through is so that you will bear fruit
[2:01:07] so well I had this problem in my life
[2:01:09] God did it God's given an opportunity
[2:01:12] for your faith to go to work I mean or
[2:01:17] the trial I know or Natalia it's an
[2:01:18] opportunity not a trial it's an
[2:01:21] opportunity for your faith to go to work
[2:01:24] why did this happen to me so my faith
[2:01:27] would have something to work on a mass
[2:01:33] that's exactly right this is this is
[2:01:37] subtly the way you've got to start
[2:01:39] looking at your trials that you're going
[2:01:41] through it is something not to destroy
[2:01:44] me I cannot be destroyed
[2:01:48] a happy turtle life I cannot be destroy
[2:01:51] this is not gonna destroy me I am here
[2:01:54] to destroy it
[2:01:56] Satan your kingdoms coming down no
[2:02:00] weapon that is formed against we can
[2:02:02] prosper I'm the son of God I've been
[2:02:05] bought by the blood
[2:02:06] I know who I am in Christ God uses men
[2:02:10] God I could use the Sun to preach the
[2:02:12] gospel could use the wind to preach the
[2:02:14] gospel but God chose men to preach the
[2:02:17] gospel
[2:02:17] that's his God's Way hey man God's going
[2:02:20] to use you he will use you to try them
[2:02:23] to over the devil hey Matt it'll be your
[2:02:27] prayers that cast him out a man it'll be
[2:02:30] your voice speaking against the enemy
[2:02:33] it'll be you standing there with the
[2:02:36] Word of God amen now but you know but
[2:02:40] you know here here again Moses under the
[2:02:43] blood of bulls and goats you know there
[2:02:46] he spoke a word of creation you know he
[2:02:50] stumbles sometimes you know God could
[2:02:52] speak a squirrel into existence God did
[2:02:54] it God could do let me tell you God was
[2:02:57] using Moses and he spoke flies life
[2:03:01] means he spoke all kinds of things you
[2:03:04] know what he was doing no not to
[2:03:06] tournament God's people but to free
[2:03:08] God's people and he was using the power
[2:03:11] of God to plague the devil does that
[2:03:16] give you any idea what you're to use the
[2:03:18] power God far not to be a puck doesn't
[2:03:20] be a you know a stuffed shirt but to
[2:03:22] plague the devil to make the devil so
[2:03:26] miserable
[2:03:27] then he finally says to you get out get
[2:03:33] out of my country get out of Egypt leave
[2:03:36] here go on and you'll say yeah we're
[2:03:39] going and we're leaving a hook line
[2:03:41] wherever one going listen what's the
[2:03:43] matter with the church today what is
[2:03:46] wrong here brother Brandon would say my
[2:03:49] opinion we're not coming with that
[2:03:51] sincerity to the right thing for if God
[2:03:54] could do that by the blood of bulls and
[2:03:56] goats and bulls that only covered sin
[2:03:59] and made appropriation for the
[2:04:01] Center but the sin was still there only
[2:04:03] covered ever what can he do to the blood
[2:04:06] of his son that omits in God has not not
[2:04:10] a factor but created a blood that takes
[2:04:13] away all sin
[2:04:15] I believe that sin will be broke up when
[2:04:18] it's confessed I've on the basis of the
[2:04:21] blood of Jesus Christ it's like dropping
[2:04:23] a drop of black ink into a bunch of
[2:04:25] Clorox bleach it just breaks it and they
[2:04:28] the chemicals and sends it plumb back to
[2:04:31] where it come from and that's the way
[2:04:33] the blood of Jesus Christ does that
[2:04:35] sends a man across the chasm again as a
[2:04:38] son of God and then why the the creative
[2:04:41] power God is in him and at least
[2:04:44] whenever God can command it to be done
[2:04:47] it'll be done but the blood puts us back
[2:04:52] on speaking terms it's time we hear the
[2:04:55] voice of God the voice of God is
[2:04:58] speaking why are you crying to me speak
[2:05:02] this is what he told him Moses he's met
[2:05:05] with an obstacle he said why are you
[2:05:07] crying to me what is all this moaning
[2:05:10] about you ought to be speaking you ought
[2:05:14] to be looking at your problem and saying
[2:05:16] it's coming down the red seats coming
[2:05:19] open
[2:05:20] hey man and when it does he's gonna
[2:05:23] drown all the Pharoah in this army all
[2:05:25] the devils are gonna be dead behind us
[2:05:26] and we're gonna be like Miriam with a
[2:05:28] tambourine shot into victory because
[2:05:32] we're not believing from here I defeated
[2:05:35] people we are leaving here victorious
[2:05:37] people a victorious church without spot
[2:05:40] or wrinkle are you with me hey man so
[2:05:43] you stand in the presence of God as a
[2:05:47] redeemed son now that's why the church
[2:05:52] is living far below it's privileged and
[2:05:57] instead of instead of coming out and
[2:06:01] facing the issue we're still just kind
[2:06:03] of probing at it wondering if it'll work
[2:06:06] but it's time we realize who we are how
[2:06:10] many's more sermons are we going to have
[2:06:12] to hear that that identifies
[2:06:15] in Christ as who we are is this children
[2:06:17] face the issue face up to it face up to
[2:06:22] the fact that you are under an atonement
[2:06:26] that your sins are forgiven that you
[2:06:31] have no past I'm looking at a people
[2:06:36] today who has a blank past there is no
[2:06:41] charge that the devil can lay on you
[2:06:45] because it's all been dealt with by the
[2:06:48] blood of Jesus Christ come on now and
[2:06:51] you stand guiltless as a son of God he
[2:06:56] never see it doesn't see anymore where
[2:06:59] you faltered where you failed where you
[2:07:01] made a mistake
[2:07:02] where were you equivalent where you had
[2:07:03] disbelieved it's all gone and you stand
[2:07:07] before him as a son of God amen under an
[2:07:12] atonement and because you're under that
[2:07:15] atonement now you can go before the
[2:07:17] throne of grace anytime and find help in
[2:07:21] your time of need
[2:07:22] a man so there's something wrong
[2:07:25] somewhere and brother branham's would
[2:07:27] say I think it's cause the
[2:07:29] denominational system has twisted the
[2:07:31] minds and so forth until they don't know
[2:07:34] how to do it but we promised it would be
[2:07:37] revealed and that's where we're living
[2:07:39] at church we're in the day of the
[2:07:41] revealing where we come back to the
[2:07:43] doctrine of Jesus Christ amen and that
[2:07:47] doctor has power it hey man that's
[2:07:50] that's why we can look around today and
[2:07:53] witness and say we have seen and are
[2:07:56] seeing the power of God we know what did
[2:07:59] you do to cancer we know what interview
[2:08:02] to brain bleeds we know what did it do
[2:08:04] to alopecia we know what they do to ever
[2:08:06] devil come on we're not worthy to do to
[2:08:09] drunkenness and drugs and alcohol and
[2:08:11] then we know what they'll do to
[2:08:13] cigarettes we know what to do for young
[2:08:15] people
[2:08:17] hey man we know what to do two sons of
[2:08:19] God a man rila bait them into position
[2:08:23] where they know who they are
[2:08:24] and they know who their God is so they
[2:08:27] knew exploits hey man that's the thing
[2:08:31] you see we're we're we're living the
[2:08:34] hour where we're no longer just to pray
[2:08:37] a prayer man but command let it be done
[2:08:42] now command God command the devil leave
[2:08:45] God's already commanded us to command
[2:08:48] him in my name you'll cast out metal
[2:08:51] that's a that is a command you've
[2:08:55] already got the command we don't have to
[2:08:57] command God and then we command the
[2:08:59] devil to leave a man resists the devil
[2:09:03] submit yourself to God resist the devil
[2:09:06] he shall flee from you are you with me
[2:09:08] but you see God will never meet anybody
[2:09:12] unless they come under the shed but it's
[2:09:16] the only meeting place of God and when
[2:09:20] you turn to blood down your meeting
[2:09:21] place has been taken away
[2:09:23] you see God made his first decision in
[2:09:26] the Garden of Eden that that man could
[2:09:29] only worship Him under the shed blood of
[2:09:31] his sacrifice and that's the only place
[2:09:34] that God met God that God met with man
[2:09:36] then and that's the only guard place
[2:09:38] that God ever will meet with me so when
[2:09:42] you take the blood away you take your
[2:09:45] meeting place away hey man your faith is
[2:09:49] gotta be placed in the blood in the
[2:09:52] atonement now you see there again that's
[2:09:57] the only place he meets his man is under
[2:10:00] the blood of his sacrifice now he won't
[2:10:02] meet you there as a Methodists or
[2:10:04] Baptists or Catholic or or whatever it
[2:10:08] is said that the denominational claim he
[2:10:10] will not meet you there as that he will
[2:10:14] meet you where wherever you are if you
[2:10:18] Methodist Baptist Catholic Pentecostal
[2:10:20] wherever if you come under the shed but
[2:10:24] he will meet you there amen because that
[2:10:31] is the meeting place so therefore this
[2:10:36] is where that we have our power that's
[2:10:38] where the the power lays is in the
[2:10:41] atonement when we meet there is that
[2:10:44] place under the blood then the power
[2:10:47] that blood goes to work on our behalf
[2:10:49] without it your meeting place is done
[2:10:52] away with you don't have a place to meet
[2:10:53] God he'll meet you under one condition
[2:10:56] where you're on to that blood and your
[2:10:57] sins are confessed and been expelled in
[2:11:00] his presence and he only can see them
[2:11:03] through that shed blood and your wife's
[2:11:07] know when you confess your sins your
[2:11:13] sins are forgiven but outside of that
[2:11:16] you're not there you can't fellowship
[2:11:18] and that's the reason that you don't see
[2:11:22] things happen in the churches they
[2:11:25] confess they believe the blood but
[2:11:26] reject the very plan to get to the blood
[2:11:29] the word and that's the only way that
[2:11:32] God will honor that word you see you'll
[2:11:35] never honored say I'm a Baptist I'm the
[2:11:37] method as I'm a Catholic I demand this
[2:11:39] to be done you can't do it like that the
[2:11:43] only way is through His grace come
[2:11:46] through this shed blood and say lord I
[2:11:49] claim the promise and then you're really
[2:11:52] under that blood and God is obligated to
[2:11:56] his word but first you've got to be
[2:11:58] under the mud and once under the blood
[2:12:01] God's obligated to his word he's
[2:12:03] obligated to back up whatever you say a
[2:12:07] man to stand behind your words a man no
[2:12:11] wonder then they can't believe in
[2:12:12] miracles can't believe in the
[2:12:15] supernatural because they condemned the
[2:12:20] bud let's talk about the blood for a
[2:12:23] moment let's talk about the blood in the
[2:12:28] work of that blood now
[2:12:34] how did the blood come about and how is
[2:12:37] it that we're under the blood you see we
[2:12:41] can always go on and say well we're
[2:12:43] under the blood well into the blood and
[2:12:45] we're talking about those pints of blood
[2:12:47] that came down out of the cross the
[2:12:49] cross and fell down to the ground and
[2:12:50] that's not the blood we're under the
[2:12:54] blood were under is that blood came by
[2:12:58] the creative power of God somebody with
[2:13:03] me
[2:13:03] hey man God took a blood cell by
[2:13:09] creation now you were talking about
[2:13:10] creation and pepper a place in the womb
[2:13:15] of Mary both did the ovum and the sperm
[2:13:20] and out of that came a body for God to
[2:13:26] come and dwell in that's what I was
[2:13:28] saying God became a man that's what the
[2:13:30] mystery was Jesus didn't just didn't
[2:13:34] make himself God God made himself a man
[2:13:36] and God came into all among us through
[2:13:39] the blood cell so therefore Jesus was
[2:13:43] the created blood of God he will not
[2:13:48] have to a nap Gentile no race on this
[2:13:51] earth can claim him as their as as
[2:13:54] coming from them and Men listen Jesus
[2:13:59] didn't come from man Jesus came from God
[2:14:04] and man came from God now so when we
[2:14:10] look at this Jesus once a creative blood
[2:14:13] of God now on the cross are you with me
[2:14:16] now we know we know those elements of
[2:14:20] the blood they went right back down to
[2:14:21] the ground and they were probably a
[2:14:23] sword during the word of the Cross and
[2:14:25] they're on the De Anza now then well
[2:14:27] where is the blood that we can go and
[2:14:29] dub some of it and put on you we don't
[2:14:32] have it because the power is not in that
[2:14:37] chemical of the blood is not in the
[2:14:40] power of of that blood that came down
[2:14:45] what it was was there was
[2:14:47] the blood cell and in the blood sellers
[2:14:51] life and when Jesus died at Calvary out
[2:14:57] of that blood was released the life of
[2:15:00] God amen amen remember that would come
[2:15:07] elements out of his body
[2:15:09] remember this you were in him when he
[2:15:12] died at Calvary because the elements of
[2:15:16] that made his bride was still in him so
[2:15:21] the water the blood and the spirit was
[2:15:23] all in him is somebody with me but
[2:15:25] they're in Calvary the blood cell was
[2:15:27] broke open and released the life of God
[2:15:31] the life of the blood remember even in
[2:15:34] the Old Testament it was freaking don't
[2:15:36] eat the blood because in there is the
[2:15:38] life
[2:15:38] a man in Jesus there in his blood was
[2:15:42] the life of God and there at the
[2:15:44] breaking of that blood cell the life of
[2:15:46] God was released are you with me that
[2:15:50] life would down'n and defeated hell
[2:15:53] defeated the grave it rose again man
[2:15:57] that life raised up his body again I'll
[2:16:01] send it on high and came again on the
[2:16:04] day of Pentecost
[2:16:05] so the atonement was made at the cross
[2:16:08] where Jesus died but the blood
[2:16:11] sprinkling came on the day of Pinnacle
[2:16:14] and they were sprinkled every one of
[2:16:16] them with the blood the life of God
[2:16:19] pillar of fire divided itself and each
[2:16:21] one of them got a lick of the fire of
[2:16:23] God that made every one of them the
[2:16:28] blood by the spirit and they were born
[2:16:30] again not of the will of man nor the
[2:16:32] will of the flesh but of God and they
[2:16:34] were ever one born of the blood of God
[2:16:36] that's how you're born when you're when
[2:16:39] you're born your new path as a son of
[2:16:41] God God is your father you're born of
[2:16:43] his blood you're not only under his
[2:16:46] blood and your sins atone buys but but
[2:16:49] you actually become the bud by the
[2:16:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost dwelling in
[2:16:54] you amen you have the blood life
[2:16:57] god they're for your sons and your hairs
[2:17:00] daughters
[2:17:01] hey ma'am all that ought to make
[2:17:04] something any man we're not talking
[2:17:07] about your human body in your human
[2:17:08] blood but his royal blood now flows
[2:17:11] through my veins I'm a son of God his
[2:17:14] life is in me the power that has in me
[2:17:18] is not my own but it's his power it's
[2:17:20] the blood of Christ living out of me you
[2:17:27] come into his presence now you come
[2:17:29] boldly into before his throne of grace
[2:17:32] remember there in the holiest of Holies
[2:17:36] there was there was some particular
[2:17:38] things that was in there one day was a
[2:17:40] pot of manna and my on the outer courts
[2:17:44] they could go out there and gather manna
[2:17:46] every way they wanted to be if they kept
[2:17:48] it over and you know one day to the next
[2:17:50] it would breed worms and stink but on
[2:17:53] the on the Sabbath there or the other
[2:17:56] Sabbath that would come an extra portion
[2:17:58] and they would take it and they would
[2:18:00] take it in their home so they would be
[2:18:01] no gathering on the Sabbath day
[2:18:04] but then Moses told them go get an owner
[2:18:07] go get up go get a bunch of this and
[2:18:11] take it in the holiest of Holies because
[2:18:15] I want every generation of priests that
[2:18:20] come into this place that they could go
[2:18:24] and get some of that original mana and
[2:18:28] eat some for themselves every month now
[2:18:33] this is exactly what God did for you and
[2:18:36] man he made open he opened the veil so
[2:18:40] you could come into his presence where
[2:18:43] every one of every generation or you as
[2:18:46] priests have you got a right to come
[2:18:48] before the throne of grace come boldly
[2:18:51] there then every generation hallelujah
[2:18:54] has a right to go in there and get a
[2:18:57] bite of that original manner that bread
[2:19:01] out of heaven are you with me this is
[2:19:03] what he gave on the day of Pentecost
[2:19:06] oh man that original
[2:19:07] mana was that every person can have
[2:19:10] their own experience with God not you
[2:19:14] and a priest not you and a password that
[2:19:16] you and God and God alone and there you
[2:19:18] go in the presence of God and you get
[2:19:20] some of that original Pentecostal mana
[2:19:24] that testifies he's still the same
[2:19:27] yesterday today and forever amen
[2:19:32] also that are in the holiest of Holies
[2:19:35] become a question on the priesthood and
[2:19:39] the priesthood would be will was who was
[2:19:43] questioned whether Aaron was truly
[2:19:46] chosen of God he said I'll tell you what
[2:19:48] you go get bring Aaron's rod and put it
[2:19:51] in here bring the others in here and
[2:19:54] place them also and I'll show you which
[2:19:57] one is mine or not my choice and he
[2:20:01] takes of Aaron's there and he put set
[2:20:03] his staff inside come on
[2:20:05] puts it inside the wholeness of Holies
[2:20:08] and it put our almond leaves and bloomed
[2:20:11] and and and made almonds in the presence
[2:20:15] of this Shekinah glory amen and when you
[2:20:19] are chosen of God and brought into that
[2:20:21] holy place amen if God could take a dead
[2:20:25] stick a man a dead stick he can take
[2:20:30] somebody who is dead in his sins and
[2:20:32] trespasses and bring them into his
[2:20:35] presence and I'd come into them and they
[2:20:38] bring forth the fruit of Almighty God
[2:20:40] hallelujah how does that happen under
[2:20:43] the
[2:20:44] [Applause]

[2:20:50] of God the very power of God the very
