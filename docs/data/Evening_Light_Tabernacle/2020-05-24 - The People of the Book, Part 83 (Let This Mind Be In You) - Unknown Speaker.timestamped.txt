[13:24] be here in the house of God to give Him

[41:41] us Amen Philippians chapter 2 and verse
[41:44] 1 we're going to read this today I read
[41:48] it last Sunday as we've preached on the
[41:51] name of Jesus the authority of the name
[41:53] of Jesus I hope that you if you wasn't
[41:55] here he was able to at least um be able
[42:00] to enter in with us but now we're going
[42:03] to look at the scripture again and a
[42:05] little slightly different direct
[42:07] today if there be any consolation in
[42:11] Christ if any comfort of love if any
[42:14] fellowship of the Spirit if any bowels
[42:17] and mercies fulfilled you my joy that
[42:20] should be like-minded having the same
[42:22] love being of one Accord one mind let
[42:28] nothing be done through strife or
[42:30] vainglory but in lowliness of mind let
[42:33] each esteem other better than themselves
[42:36] look not every man on his own things but
[42:39] every man also on the things of others
[42:43] let this mind be in you which was also
[42:45] in Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[42:50] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[42:52] with God but made himself of no
[42:55] reputation and took upon him the form of
[42:58] a servant which was made in the likeness
[43:00] of men and being found in fashion as a
[43:04] man he humbled himself and became
[43:07] obedient unto death even the death of
[43:10] the cross
[43:12] wherefore God hath out our own wherefore
[43:16] God also hath highly exalted him and
[43:19] given him a name which is above every
[43:22] name that at the name of Jesus every
[43:24] knee should bow of things in heaven and
[43:27] things in earth and things under the
[43:29] earth and that every tongue should
[43:32] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the
[43:35] glory of God the Father amen may God
[43:38] bless you you can be seated amen
[43:41] and it good to be in the house of the
[43:43] Lord today a man we just want to enter
[43:47] in with all of our hearts and give us a
[43:49] little bit of time this morning as we
[43:51] look into the word and we share that
[43:54] which is some real to our hearts and
[43:57] what means so much to us and let the
[44:01] Holy Spirit speak to you and reveal it
[44:03] to unum in a real and living way I just
[44:06] wanted to make a mention um as I was
[44:09] mentioning in my prayer about those that
[44:12] are incarcerated for this gospel there
[44:15] in China there's been several believers
[44:18] and believe in pastors and
[44:19] have been arrested for sharing the King
[44:22] James Version Bible that has been
[44:24] translated into Chinese and they judge
[44:30] that to be extremist and anti-government
[44:33] so they put them into prison for that
[44:37] for that reason for sharing the Bible
[44:40] the Word of God also you know that that
[44:44] work was done of course you know by the
[44:47] believers up in up in Canada but the
[44:51] bisca land the Saints there that
[44:53] supported that work many many others
[44:55] that supported at work to get the King
[44:58] James Version Bible into their language
[45:00] and so it's been a real blessing but at
[45:04] the same time it's not without sacrifice
[45:06] then also we've had um you know just
[45:10] recently well it was about three years
[45:14] ago maybe for that very large shipment
[45:18] was sent in from from Jeffersonville to
[45:22] to Russia contained in a lot of the
[45:25] tablets that they that they have and it
[45:28] was investigated it was a very unwise
[45:31] thing to do in a communist country like
[45:34] that but they just you know decided to
[45:37] be really bold and do it and so they did
[45:40] it and and they confiscated the whole
[45:43] shipment and then that began to look in
[45:47] it and and the the went to court because
[45:52] it was a prosecutor had determined that
[45:55] it was extremist literature and so they
[45:59] they they took him tried to ban it and
[46:03] the court rejected it so the prosecutor
[46:07] went ahead and and put it into an a
[46:11] higher court and so now now that Court
[46:16] has judged it as extremism and so
[46:19] therefore the church age book and many
[46:22] many other other sermons of brother
[46:24] branham's are not going to be allowed to
[46:25] be in the nation of Russia you can
[46:28] imagine what this does to many of the
[46:31] believers there
[46:32] as they they are as this has been you
[46:39] know has it has been determined
[46:41] extremist material so in a way if you
[46:45] will be improved for the believers there
[46:47] as they appeal that and try to go to a
[46:51] higher court and get that throat out
[46:53] again we know God can do that
[46:55] Amen but we also know that you know
[46:58] we're living in a time where the Word of
[47:00] God is not wanted and it's not welcome a
[47:03] man in truth is being refused and so you
[47:09] know so as we we look at it you know
[47:13] that today we just want to value what we
[47:16] have and appreciate what God has given
[47:19] us and the opportunities that we have to
[47:22] worship God as we see to fit to worship
[47:26] the Lord and I'll tell you what I
[47:28] believe it is extreme the message is is
[47:31] so extreme it changes lives it makes
[47:33] real good citizens out of people it
[47:36] takes those that were thieves and and
[47:39] those that have done you know evil in
[47:42] their lives and it changes them and
[47:44] transform them into sons and daughters
[47:46] of God so that is pretty extreme any men
[47:50] but I'll tell you we want it we want it
[47:52] to do the same for our lives
[47:53] amen the message of course that we know
[47:56] and we have received it does not it does
[47:59] not make evil people out of us it makes
[48:02] some of the most wonderful people in the
[48:05] whole wide world and the devil hates it
[48:07] a man but we love it and we thank God
[48:11] for the truth that has liberated us a
[48:14] man made us into sons and daughters of
[48:16] God now this morning I'm going to be
[48:19] speaking to you on let this mind be in
[48:22] you that was in Christ Jesus so as we as
[48:26] we look at it today I I want to just
[48:30] speak just for a moment of a certain
[48:33] direction that Paul was using here as he
[48:37] was talking of Jesus humbling himself to
[48:40] the father's wheel and we should also
[48:43] and he said that let nothing
[48:46] done through strife or vainglory that's
[48:49] verse three but in lowliness of mind let
[48:52] each esteem other better than themselves
[48:57] so you know there is some there is
[49:00] certainly your egg truth to this that
[49:03] when we become a Christian it brings a
[49:05] certain humility about us where that we
[49:10] can esteem others better than ourselves
[49:12] I think that's a whole lot of problem
[49:14] with a lot of marriages and so on like
[49:18] that is that many times this is not put
[49:21] into practice the way it should be that
[49:23] we esteem one another they they are mate
[49:27] better than ourselves the Bible said
[49:30] that amounts of love is wife as Christ
[49:33] loved the church and gave himself for it
[49:36] and that so the same thing that eternal
[49:40] life is giving giving are living for
[49:44] others and the same thing that they're
[49:47] giving on the the wife's part to of
[49:51] submission and working together in
[49:54] harmony with each other and so it should
[49:58] not let anything be done through strife
[50:00] or vainglory but in lowliness of mind
[50:05] let each esteem others better than
[50:08] themselves but then Paul points out that
[50:11] Christ though he thought it was not
[50:14] robbery to be equal with God but made
[50:18] himself of no reputation but was made in
[50:20] the fashion of man and while a man he
[50:24] humbled himself to obedience even to the
[50:28] death on the cross so I want you to know
[50:31] they again this is very extreme he
[50:34] humbled himself to obedience even to
[50:37] death on the cross so he would humble
[50:40] himself as a man to obedience to God to
[50:46] his word and let the word have such
[50:49] preeminence so he was even such one that
[50:52] when he when he came yesterday would
[50:56] find you know 2,000 years ago we find he
[50:59] did
[50:59] even have a place to lay his head and
[51:03] the birds he said all of the air they
[51:05] have but Nast and the foxes have got
[51:07] dens but he said I don't have a place to
[51:10] lay my head when it came to the world he
[51:13] would borrow a womb to be born in and
[51:17] they had no cradle turret to lay him in
[51:20] so they put him in a box of straw and
[51:23] when he died they nailed him to a Roman
[51:26] tree unto under capital punishment he
[51:30] had but one robe and had been made for
[51:32] him woven throughout without a seaman
[51:35] and he had the bar than a grave to be
[51:37] buried in so you know none of us are
[51:40] that bad off Jesus the Almighty God
[51:44] would humble himself and become a man I
[51:48] want to just point this out again me he
[51:51] would humble himself to the Father's
[51:53] will and as a man he continued to Humble
[51:57] himself through the Word of God into the
[52:00] Father's will he came to show what God
[52:04] that was anything that's high and
[52:07] haughty isn't God a man God is low and
[52:11] humble and that's what made him God
[52:13] something that comes down low not them
[52:16] that goes high and exalts himself it's
[52:19] always Satan that is exalting himself
[52:22] you know God doesn't dwell in
[52:25] hierarchies and things he dwells in
[52:27] humility and you and I'm you humble
[52:31] yourself and you'll be exalted you exalt
[52:33] yourself and you will be humbled and God
[52:36] knows how to do that so you have to
[52:39] remember you humble yourself before God
[52:41] and don't try to think your own thoughts
[52:44] but to think his thoughts so we are to
[52:49] are to have the mind of Christ now
[52:53] that's what we're speaking about on this
[52:55] morning is let this mind the mind of
[52:58] Christ being you and and humble
[53:02] ourselves to the will of God and it's
[53:06] amazing to think that we as humans now
[53:09] listen closely as we kind of change this
[53:12] now
[53:13] direction I want to take this today
[53:15] because it's amazing to think that we as
[53:17] humans have exalted our own thoughts and
[53:21] our own minds so far about God and His
[53:26] Word until we actually have to humble
[53:28] ourselves down from our high and lofty
[53:32] thinking to accept the higher thoughts
[53:35] of God are you with me now hey man so it
[53:40] did this is this is what we do as humans
[53:43] we as human beings we we we think
[53:46] ourselves is so great and our thinking
[53:49] and our is so great and and our science
[53:52] our education our knowledge and the
[53:56] supreme knowledge that we have and
[53:59] control over the universe and control
[54:02] over the elements and that we think of
[54:05] ourselves and our thoughts are so great
[54:09] until we actually have to humble
[54:12] ourselves down in order to receive the
[54:17] higher things of God now remember Satan
[54:21] has never been higher than God but in
[54:25] his own heart he says I will exalt
[54:28] myself above the sons of God and and sin
[54:33] of course is exalting your own thoughts
[54:36] above the Word of God remember that's
[54:39] where the first sin would begin in
[54:41] heaven where that where that Satan would
[54:45] exalt his own thoughts in his own wheel
[54:49] over the Word of God can you imagine
[54:52] that trying to place himself in a
[54:55] position higher than God he said I want
[54:59] to be like God I want I want to be
[55:01] worshipped
[55:02] I want to me I want to exalt myself over
[55:06] his sons
[55:07] I want a position that is not mine and
[55:11] I'm gonna exalt myself over God and over
[55:15] his word and then of course this is what
[55:18] he did when he comes down to the earth
[55:21] and
[55:22] and walks upon the earth we find and he
[55:25] he gets done in and exalts the serpent
[55:29] takes the serpent right next to man and
[55:32] puts in him a desire to exalt himself
[55:36] you know make himself equal or make
[55:40] himself higher than man himself and so
[55:44] he would then take and and he would
[55:47] begin with even with a reasoning and
[55:50] this reason would be to exalt her
[55:54] thinking her reasoning over God's Word
[55:59] are you with me so instead of humbling
[56:02] down to the word exalt over the word now
[56:07] look with me in Isaiah chapter 55 and
[56:11] verse 6 seek he the Lord while he may be
[56:13] found and call upon him while he is near
[56:16] this is a wonderful scripture isn't it a
[56:18] man while he can be found to call upon
[56:22] him while he's near this time to move a
[56:26] service like this today this is a time
[56:29] to move toward God a man let the wicked
[56:32] forsake his way and the unrighteous man
[56:36] his thoughts notice this the unrighteous
[56:39] has to forsake his thoughts and let him
[56:43] return unto the Lord he will have mercy
[56:46] upon him and to our God for he will
[56:49] abundantly pardon for he says Martin my
[56:53] thoughts are not your thoughts neither
[56:56] are your ways my ways saith the Lord for
[57:00] is the heavens are higher than the earth
[57:02] so are my ways higher than your ways and
[57:05] my thoughts than your thoughts so God
[57:09] says these very things he says my
[57:12] thoughts are higher than men thoughts
[57:15] no matter how high now that we're
[57:17] thinking eye thoughts are Amon - so high
[57:21] - we have to Humble down to get the
[57:23] higher thoughts
[57:25] [Applause]
[57:26] amen amen because Satan exalts it and we
[57:31] have to run back down to come back down
[57:34] in order to receive what is actually
[57:36] higher you've got to Humble down to
[57:41] accept God's Word and what he says and
[57:43] his promise and man you gotta forfeit
[57:47] your own thoughts your own thinking your
[57:50] own reasoning what science says or what
[57:54] doctors say or what - so whatever the
[57:56] situation your reasoning is saying it
[57:59] all has got to be taken and tumbled down
[58:03] and accept the higher thoughts now 1st
[58:10] Corinthians chapter 2 verse 16 tells us
[58:14] aware of believers position is he says
[58:18] for who have known the mind of the Lord
[58:21] that he may instruct him because nobody
[58:25] can tell god what to do but then he says
[58:29] but we have the mind of Christ now this
[58:35] is what a real believer is he has the
[58:38] same mind that Christ had he thinks what
[58:45] Jesus thinks and because he seeks like
[58:50] Jesus takes he he behaves like Jesus
[58:53] behaves all right now so we have the
[58:56] mind of Christ then we have the same
[58:58] attitude toward the word that Christ did
[59:03] they might whatever the work said we're
[59:06] gonna take it and man if the word said
[59:08] by His stripes were healed we're gonna
[59:10] believe we're healed if it says that we
[59:13] can be saved we're gonna believe we're
[59:15] safe I'm not whatever his words said
[59:18] we're gonna accept that over what our
[59:20] thinking is what modern theology is what
[59:24] the society around the self is the high
[59:28] exalted thinking of the day we're gonna
[59:30] take God's Word
[59:32] because God's Word is higher than any
[59:36] other word but you're gonna have to
[59:37] Humble down in order to see it in his
[59:41] right place because as long as you're up
[59:45] here exalting your own taken over the
[59:47] Word of God you're in the place that
[59:49] Satan is this is satanic thinking and in
[59:55] order to come down to God's thinking
[59:57] you've got to come down and humble down
[59:59] and really realize it's higher than what
[1:00:03] your reasoning what your thinking and
[1:00:06] your attitude is gonna have to come the
[1:00:09] same as Jesus attitude I have come to do
[1:00:14] the Father's will I'm not here to do my
[1:00:17] own oil and you realize that you have a
[1:00:21] will and that will has got to be
[1:00:23] surrendered to his will all right so now
[1:00:28] if we have the mind of Christ then we
[1:00:30] have the same attitude toward the word
[1:00:33] as he did whatever he said whatever the
[1:00:37] word says takes preeminence over what I
[1:00:40] thought what I think or what what
[1:00:43] anybody else says what society around me
[1:00:46] says what what the world is saying is
[1:00:49] cool what the world is saying is is what
[1:00:53] we're supposed to be like we humble down
[1:00:57] and we say God's Word is true right
[1:01:00] hey man so turn with me to Colossians
[1:01:02] chapter 3 and verse 8 and I always just
[1:01:05] want to look at some of the things of
[1:01:07] the scripture as we go along because I
[1:01:10] want to establish that the believer has
[1:01:13] the mind of Christ amen
[1:01:16] now Colossians three and eight but now
[1:01:19] put off all these anger wrath malice
[1:01:23] blasphemy filthy communications out of
[1:01:28] your mouth a man although guessing
[1:01:31] vulgar words all the other thing put out
[1:01:34] a man malice
[1:01:37] yeah you know um that's ill-will
[1:01:41] anger get it all out line up to one
[1:01:45] another seeing you have put off the old
[1:01:48] man with his deeds that belongs to your
[1:01:52] first nature a man that belongs to your
[1:01:56] past that's not who you are
[1:01:59] here's who you are and we put on the new
[1:02:02] man which is renewed the watts renewed
[1:02:08] in knowledge after the image of him that
[1:02:12] created him so now you've got you've got
[1:02:15] a new man and he's got a renewed
[1:02:17] knowledge a new knowledge is above the
[1:02:20] knowledge of man it's the knowledge of
[1:02:23] God and we are we are renewed in the
[1:02:26] knowledge of after the image of him that
[1:02:29] created him now so you put on the new
[1:02:32] man a man you must be born again that's
[1:02:36] how you put on the new man there's only
[1:02:40] one way the old man's gonna die it's
[1:02:44] thinking has to die its reasoning have
[1:02:48] to die what do you think is right and
[1:02:50] wrong come on has to die because because
[1:02:56] with the world they got a whole
[1:02:58] different sort of a value system than
[1:03:01] what the Bible does the Word of God does
[1:03:05] you know you you said well it needs
[1:03:07] doesn't matter how I dress it doesn't
[1:03:10] matter what I look like it doesn't
[1:03:11] matter about my makeup it doesn't matter
[1:03:13] about my Maya my high heels it doesn't
[1:03:17] matter about what I do is it doesn't
[1:03:19] matter you are only going by what the
[1:03:24] society around you since that's okay but
[1:03:30] now we have got a different knowledge
[1:03:33] and that knowledge is a higher knowledge
[1:03:37] than what you can get at Notre Dame or
[1:03:41] what you can get at Yale or what you can
[1:03:45] get in the finest schools are the
[1:03:47] colleges of the world
[1:03:49] you haven't seen a higher
[1:03:50] College than all the degrees that you
[1:03:53] can paste everywhere and you can put it
[1:03:56] on and say I've been to school and I've
[1:03:58] got my diplomas and I've got my PhD and
[1:04:01] I've got my doctors I got all of this
[1:04:04] this knowledge is higher the doctors
[1:04:07] PhDs
[1:04:08] man anything that man's God this is a
[1:04:12] high knowledge but you see to be a
[1:04:15] Christian you've got to admit that that
[1:04:18] knowledge of God is a great knowledge
[1:04:21] then your own knowledge now this is a
[1:04:26] danger this is a danger of going to
[1:04:29] school in college and whatever is
[1:04:32] because you know it was a
[1:04:34] self-importance and demand that he knows
[1:04:37] so much that he can't receive anything
[1:04:41] of the Word of God because they got a
[1:04:43] higher knowledge Amen now but it's not a
[1:04:50] higher knowledge it's a lower knowledge
[1:04:56] much lower as high as the heavens is
[1:04:59] from the earth now so the approach to
[1:05:05] the birth you have to go to the process
[1:05:07] just like anything that lives anything
[1:05:10] that's lives again has to got to die
[1:05:12] first you cannot keep your same spirit
[1:05:15] you cannot keep your same habits you
[1:05:19] cannot keep your same thoughts you've
[1:05:23] got to die you got to die like Jesus
[1:05:25] died I mean you got to die on your own
[1:05:29] on your altar like Abel did with his
[1:05:32] llama you got to die with your i'm
[1:05:35] Christ this is where we miss it on the
[1:05:39] new birth because many of them are
[1:05:42] trying to get born again and the old man
[1:05:45] isn't dead yet but in order to be born
[1:05:50] again the old man's got to die first
[1:05:54] because they cannot coexist you cannot
[1:05:57] serve God and Mammon so you see you've
[1:06:02] got to die with your lamb you've got to
[1:06:04] die to your own tinkin to be born to his
[1:06:07] thinking man you let the mind that was
[1:06:11] in Christ being you so when you were
[1:06:14] born you were born with a mind of a
[1:06:17] human that could be developed by
[1:06:20] knowledge when you're born again you are
[1:06:23] born a son or daughter of God you are
[1:06:26] born with the mind of Christ when you're
[1:06:28] born again that is to be developed a man
[1:06:33] by receiving the knowledge of God by his
[1:06:35] word you begin to learn who God is what
[1:06:39] he can do what is power is you learned
[1:06:43] that his knowledge is higher than any
[1:06:46] other knowledge are you with me man now
[1:06:50] so he says you cannot think his thoughts
[1:06:55] and deny his words you see the Bible
[1:07:00] said he cannot deny himself so there is
[1:07:05] none of this word that he can deny a man
[1:07:09] a man he might he must accept every word
[1:07:14] of this to be the truth so in Christ
[1:07:16] comes into you are you with me if Jesus
[1:07:20] comes in your life the Jesus and you
[1:07:23] must acknowledge every bit of this word
[1:07:26] to be true whether you understand it or
[1:07:30] not whether you can reason it out or not
[1:07:33] it mean you take what God said and it
[1:07:36] goes over your own thinking your own
[1:07:39] reasoning your own beliefs the
[1:07:45] Colombians tell you your whole seven
[1:07:48] belief systems came with your first
[1:07:49] birth and you're gonna have to die to
[1:07:52] that what you think is right and wrong
[1:07:59] comes with your first birth what do you
[1:08:02] think is okay and not okay it comes with
[1:08:04] your first birth
[1:08:08] now so you cannot you cannot have the
[1:08:13] mind of Christ in you which is the Holy
[1:08:15] Ghost and deny gimme
[1:08:18] of the word you're gonna have to believe
[1:08:23] it and it's demon over your own thinking
[1:08:27] hey man now this is this is the evidence
[1:08:30] that their old man and his thinking is
[1:08:33] dead mind that he is no longer no longer
[1:08:38] exists anymore you pay him no more mind
[1:08:42] turn with me to Romans chapter 6 and
[1:08:45] verse 4 if you will look here with me
[1:08:48] now I'm just going to establish some
[1:08:49] things and then we'll get into what I
[1:08:51] want to preach about this morning but
[1:08:53] laying this foundation real quickly
[1:08:55] Romans 6 and for therefore we are buried
[1:09:00] with him by baptism into death that like
[1:09:03] as Christ was raised up from the dead by
[1:09:06] the glory of the Father even so we
[1:09:08] should walk in the newness of life so we
[1:09:12] can see here what he said we are buried
[1:09:15] with him we die with him
[1:09:18] so therefore we are buried with him of
[1:09:20] course the problem comes is that we're
[1:09:23] burying too many people that are alive
[1:09:27] my mind they didn't scratch herself out
[1:09:30] of the grave under the water in grave
[1:09:31] and get up you don't go down the drive
[1:09:33] center come up a wet one that's all the
[1:09:36] change there is but you see what it
[1:09:39] requires is a death to your old man a
[1:09:43] complete dying out therefore we are
[1:09:46] buried with him by baptism into death
[1:09:48] that life as Christ raised up from the
[1:09:51] dead by the glory of the Father even so
[1:09:53] we should walk in the newness of life so
[1:09:56] our new life walks in the power of the
[1:09:59] Resurrection verse 5 for if we have been
[1:10:03] planted together in the likeness of his
[1:10:05] death we shall also be in the likeness
[1:10:08] of his resurrection so if we've truly
[1:10:11] been playing
[1:10:12] a man in the likeness of his death will
[1:10:15] raise up to live a new life a different
[1:10:18] life a man knowing this that our old man
[1:10:23] is crucified with him that the body of
[1:10:27] sin might be destroyed that we should
[1:10:29] henceforth we should not serve sin for
[1:10:33] he that is dead is freed from sin and
[1:10:38] here's the thing the Bible's clear sin
[1:10:40] will no longer have dominion over you
[1:10:44] sin is a belief so unbelief will no
[1:10:47] longer have power over and out come on I
[1:10:54] believe all the things that goes with it
[1:10:58] it no longer has power over you so you
[1:11:03] have to power them to walk in faith amen
[1:11:08] you have the power then to walk in truth
[1:11:11] with the newness of life with a new mind
[1:11:15] with a new thinking renewed after the
[1:11:19] knowledge of him hey man now that's why
[1:11:24] we're baptized into his name that we
[1:11:27] might come forth in his name in his
[1:11:29] death and his resurrection that we rise
[1:11:31] again and we testifying that we have a
[1:11:34] new life that the old man is dead and we
[1:11:37] buried that first nature and man that
[1:11:41] first nature is gone and now we have the
[1:11:44] nature of him now remember the reason
[1:11:46] why we got that old nature that old sin
[1:11:48] nature is because that's what Adam
[1:11:50] accepted at the beginning when he turned
[1:11:54] down the eternal life he accepted sin
[1:11:56] nature into his life and the other one
[1:11:59] of us are born with the need to be born
[1:12:01] again we were born wrong so we had to
[1:12:05] have the right birth so he wants to
[1:12:09] cancel out the old birth so that you can
[1:12:12] have a new birth because the only way
[1:12:15] you can go to heaven is to be born again
[1:12:19] so you cannot with the first birth go to
[1:12:23] heaven now that's the problem people are
[1:12:28] trying to get to heaven today and they
[1:12:30] never been born again they're just
[1:12:33] thinking God's going to accept them the
[1:12:35] way they are and God ain't gonna accept
[1:12:37] you the way you are you must die out to
[1:12:41] see him so therefore the first nature
[1:12:45] that you were born with has to be gone
[1:12:48] it has to be dead crucified with him and
[1:12:52] then he lives in us and we don't do our
[1:12:54] own wheel anymore we don't do we do his
[1:12:58] will we don't take our own thoughts the
[1:13:01] mind the mind is what takes the mind
[1:13:04] that was in Christ Jesus isn't every
[1:13:07] believer hey man now listen I mean I'm
[1:13:12] quoting you this to you from souls in
[1:13:14] prison right now where he says the mind
[1:13:17] the mind that was in that was in Christ
[1:13:21] Jesus is in every believer this is what
[1:13:25] Paul said we have the mind of Christ so
[1:13:29] I want you to get it the baptism of the
[1:13:31] Holy Ghost the Spirit of God in you is
[1:13:33] the mind of Christ and man now he said
[1:13:41] so there's the soul that's what we're
[1:13:43] speaking of that's apart I'm thinking of
[1:13:45] now that's within us the soul the mind
[1:13:47] that is in Christ Jesus is now in your
[1:13:51] soul resident there once resided sin
[1:13:55] nature but now resides in there the mind
[1:14:00] of Christ before it was a mind of Satan
[1:14:04] and his works and his deeds you did but
[1:14:08] now you are new creation
[1:14:11] I mean old things are passed away and
[1:14:13] now your son or a daughter of God and as
[1:14:16] a son or daughter of God you can live in
[1:14:19] walk in the newness of life now we are
[1:14:26] to live our life that we live here
[1:14:31] it must be more than just for mortal
[1:14:35] existence in this life and because this
[1:14:41] is where you said man shall not live by
[1:14:43] bread alone but by every word what's
[1:14:49] this now let me delenn even let me just
[1:14:51] kind of shorten it for you man shall
[1:14:53] live by every word that proceedeth out
[1:14:57] of the mouth of God
[1:14:58] so therefore if we're if we are not
[1:15:01] living by every word then what is it
[1:15:05] we're we're walking in depth a man this
[1:15:09] is real important that the word must
[1:15:12] have preeminence because this is what
[1:15:16] brother madam will preach about in stem
[1:15:17] Christ the mystery once that he could
[1:15:20] get preeminence in a people he was going
[1:15:22] to take him back to Eden and so it's
[1:15:26] very important that you give the Word of
[1:15:28] God preeminence in your life amen
[1:15:34] now a man's physical being we wanted to
[1:15:38] try take care of it that's why he said
[1:15:39] man some I've lived by just bread alone
[1:15:41] just my physical existence and taken
[1:15:44] care of of our human body and and what
[1:15:47] our needs are but that's not the only
[1:15:49] reason God put you here on the earth you
[1:15:54] know you know some of you are going to
[1:15:58] school but I want you to understand
[1:16:01] whatever you're going for that's not the
[1:16:03] reason you're here
[1:16:06] the reason you are here is that you
[1:16:09] might live by every word that you might
[1:16:13] live a life in this Satan's Eden an
[1:16:16] overcoming in a dominating life that
[1:16:19] dominates in dominates unbelief that
[1:16:23] lives a Christian like that's why you're
[1:16:25] here these other things are fleeting
[1:16:29] they will pass away but there's one
[1:16:32] thing that's eternal and that's God in
[1:16:34] his life
[1:16:36] hey man sometimes where we're putting
[1:16:38] our emphases on the bread alone
[1:16:43] when our emphases got to be on every
[1:16:46] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[1:16:48] God now because you see that counts for
[1:16:53] varied a little what we're doing with
[1:16:55] our natural life but it's our soul that
[1:16:58] counts it's a inward man that did not
[1:17:00] come from the earth he came from heaven
[1:17:03] and that she turned part of the human
[1:17:05] being we have been born from above we
[1:17:10] have been born of a higher knowledge any
[1:17:15] born again believer I don't care if
[1:17:17] they've got but a third-grade education
[1:17:19] you are got a higher knowledge and a
[1:17:23] higher thinking than the great doctors
[1:17:26] and professors that are in the land
[1:17:29] today you have got a higher knowledge
[1:17:32] understanding a higher thing than all
[1:17:36] that they have they are way beneath you
[1:17:42] and I know they want to look down their
[1:17:45] nose you know how the did for my god you
[1:17:48] don't have the education I got you don't
[1:17:50] have the knowledge I got we got a higher
[1:17:53] knowledge the knowledge we have received
[1:17:58] is a higher knowledge than what the
[1:18:01] world has to offer
[1:18:02] it is so hot it is as high as the
[1:18:06] heavens are from the earth it is a
[1:18:09] higher knowledge than the anything man
[1:18:12] can cover you can look at the greatest
[1:18:14] scientists in the world and maybe he
[1:18:17] understands face and he understands
[1:18:19] rockets and he understands energy and he
[1:18:22] understands gravity and he understands
[1:18:25] and he's a mathematic and he can come up
[1:18:28] with all these equations and you say he
[1:18:30] is a very very smart intelligent man but
[1:18:33] you have received a higher intelligence
[1:18:37] [Music]
[1:18:38] hallelujah you have received a higher
[1:18:40] knowledge you've got a greater mind but
[1:18:45] being born again that what you can ever
[1:18:47] get in college
[1:18:50] hey ma'am you may be looking and they
[1:18:53] may say but I ain't stole the test and
[1:18:55] I've got the 4.0 plus and I've got
[1:18:58] everything I I'm in the what they gotta
[1:19:01] call all the great the Great's of
[1:19:03] societies that they belong to and their
[1:19:06] Honors Society but I want you to know
[1:19:08] you belong to a greater honor society
[1:19:11] than what the world could ever offer you
[1:19:15] may not be able to read or you may not
[1:19:17] even be able to write but I'll tell you
[1:19:19] you if you receive the Holy Ghost you've
[1:19:21] got a higher knowledge then all that the
[1:19:26] world has to offer now I know man
[1:19:35] because his science is education and
[1:19:39] it's an exalted knowledge but in order
[1:19:45] to receive God because they exalted to
[1:19:49] where there is no God they exalted to
[1:19:52] where it just all evolved out of nothing
[1:19:54] that's stupid that's stupidity hey man
[1:20:03] leave you operated on that man you
[1:20:04] wouldn't find a brain in him come on man
[1:20:10] because why he he is he again he's
[1:20:14] showing how senseless and I'm stupid and
[1:20:17] how naive have dumbed I don't know how
[1:20:21] I'm running out of adjectives you know
[1:20:28] because of he is exalted knowledge but
[1:20:32] all he is compared to God is he's not
[1:20:35] even a canary brain and I want you to
[1:20:40] know all your human knowledge is that
[1:20:42] way that's why we have to exalt the word
[1:20:46] to a place that it supersedes everything
[1:20:50] that we ever learned everything we ever
[1:20:53] received every
[1:20:55] we ever had and I think math and we put
[1:20:59] the word in a place of Dominion then
[1:21:02] then it's higher than every other word
[1:21:05] that there is God's Word is higher
[1:21:12] heavens and earth will pass away but not
[1:21:15] one jot or tittle of this will is that
[1:21:19] right you tell me any science it can say
[1:21:22] that hey man why my with the cupboard 19
[1:21:28] we have had or you don't know what to
[1:21:30] believe then change their mind so many
[1:21:33] ways of a scientist the greatest the
[1:21:36] build the one stare at the head I you
[1:21:38] know they've had all kinds of ideas and
[1:21:41] criminai make corrections here and there
[1:21:43] there God never has to make corrections
[1:21:46] he never asked to take a word back he
[1:21:49] don't never change his mind what if he
[1:21:52] said in the beginning is still true
[1:21:54] today man that's why he every shield
[1:21:57] he's still a healer if he ever saved
[1:21:59] he's still a savior a man's he ever
[1:22:02] delivered he's still a deliverer you can
[1:22:04] count on this God because he's got a
[1:22:07] knowledge that is superior to any man's
[1:22:10] knowledge now this is what we don't like
[1:22:17] to hear but man must not think for
[1:22:19] himself now that's what you're being
[1:22:22] told you got to think for yourself but
[1:22:27] man must not take for himself he must
[1:22:30] let the mind that was in Christ being
[1:22:34] him we're not to take for herself we're
[1:22:37] to call everything contrary to what he
[1:22:40] says as though it's not a man no matter
[1:22:44] what our eyes are claiming what our
[1:22:46] senses are saying what our feelings feel
[1:22:50] like what we heard from the highest
[1:22:55] knowledge what we are seeing in our
[1:22:57] symptoms we have to declare God's Word
[1:23:01] over everything we see taste smell feel
[1:23:05] are here because faith says he's healed
[1:23:09] us faith says he's delivered us faith
[1:23:12] says it was done at Calvary faith says
[1:23:15] he paper by his sight I am healed and
[1:23:20] faith gives a greater sense and these
[1:23:25] measly little silly five senses they
[1:23:28] can't see anything further than the end
[1:23:30] of our nose so like a seed we have to
[1:23:41] rot away the old man if the gain of
[1:23:46] corners never planted and go through a
[1:23:48] change where it changes forms it always
[1:23:50] just be a nice polished seed
[1:23:53] it'll never bring forth life some people
[1:23:58] just want to belong to church but they
[1:24:00] never changed I'm gonna tell you some of
[1:24:05] you are still the pretty little grain of
[1:24:07] corn that showed up at church and sat on
[1:24:10] the Pew 15-20 years ago
[1:24:17] hey man you know the day that you belong
[1:24:20] to church but you never change
[1:24:24] it's just Church than just a place to
[1:24:27] socialize
[1:24:28] it's a place I'll just show up new
[1:24:31] clothes and it's not really essential
[1:24:36] you know you can show up late and take
[1:24:38] in as much of it as you want
[1:24:41] hello hey man you can drag in 30 minutes
[1:24:46] late and they get them because it
[1:24:49] doesn't really matter it's not that
[1:24:50] essential it's not that important
[1:24:55] we can take in what service we want to
[1:24:58] and and couldn't Johnson higher
[1:25:02] likelihood so over the Word of God
[1:25:05] somebody help me preach Amen because why
[1:25:09] we just feel a pretty little polished
[1:25:12] green listen listen they found that
[1:25:16] found in the tombs of other Egypt they
[1:25:19] found some grains of wheat that had been
[1:25:23] laying there for over a thousands of
[1:25:26] years they figured four or five six
[1:25:29] thousand years as they found them and
[1:25:31] they never had any manifestation of any
[1:25:35] life in them until they were planted but
[1:25:41] when they were planted in the old seed
[1:25:43] rotted away that 6,000 year old weak
[1:25:46] blossom that moved and I'm telling you
[1:25:50] unless that's you immerse yourself in
[1:25:52] Christ unless you are buried in Christ
[1:25:55] unless the old man rocks away you're
[1:26:00] just gonna be a pretty little seed that
[1:26:02] never has any light only fit for the
[1:26:11] rats to eat okay let me tell you our
[1:26:19] president declared the churches are
[1:26:22] essential but too long Christians have
[1:26:26] treated it as non-essential they skipped
[1:26:30] services they pick and choose which ones
[1:26:32] that want to tend they treat worship
[1:26:34] services not as though it's just
[1:26:36] entertainment
[1:26:37] it ain't entertainment
[1:26:40] oh man it's not about making you feel
[1:26:43] good it's welcoming his presence
[1:26:46] it's about eager to his courts with
[1:26:48] praise so he can growl in the praises of
[1:26:51] his people moving in the spirit get it
[1:26:56] you find the price about it where it
[1:26:59] produces a worship that draws God near a
[1:27:06] man sermons not to be treated as some
[1:27:11] self-help psychology no sir
[1:27:16] you know Church has got to mean more to
[1:27:21] you than that you know people who want
[1:27:26] to come to the altar and and you know
[1:27:28] get up and say well you don't kneel
[1:27:30] there just a minute or two and say well
[1:27:32] I've got the new birth get some preacher
[1:27:35] to pray for you I'm born again you got
[1:27:39] to stay until all your thoughts of your
[1:27:43] own self and your worldly things are
[1:27:45] running away from you and you're dead
[1:27:47] and you're rotten and then it's all gone
[1:27:50] from you in the new birth takes place a
[1:27:52] man dude oh my you might slobber in
[1:27:55] jabber and you might you need but I'll
[1:27:59] tell you you'll come up lately with a
[1:28:01] new condition with a new heart and a new
[1:28:03] birth something is used that's a lie a
[1:28:07] man that makes you different from what
[1:28:09] you want and you see your new birth kid
[1:28:12] come in till there's a death to the old
[1:28:14] man and people don't want to die they
[1:28:17] want to take their own dinky they hear
[1:28:21] the prophet of God preached about make
[1:28:23] up
[1:28:23] well I don't think he knew what he was
[1:28:25] talking about you know why because
[1:28:27] you're exult in your own mind
[1:28:30] and your mind probably came from the
[1:28:34] opinions of the world and not from Bible
[1:28:43] well they really didn't matter this hair
[1:28:46] business don't matter I can cut my hair
[1:28:48] if I I want to sure you can you're a
[1:28:51] sinner and sinners do whatever they want
[1:28:54] to do but those who have the mind of
[1:28:56] Christ think about it like Christ thinks
[1:28:58] about it like the Bible thinks about and
[1:29:01] so you see it's it's very evidence you
[1:29:04] ain't gonna give that just you've got
[1:29:07] the old bag now select the mind that was
[1:29:15] in Christ being you where you think
[1:29:17] God's thoughts and when you think God's
[1:29:20] thoughts that drains God's blessings and
[1:29:23] God's power to you and it'll make a mess
[1:29:26] out of you
[1:29:27] oh man it'll change your life and make
[1:29:29] you a new creature in Christ Jesus you
[1:29:32] won't be the same anymore you you me
[1:29:35] make together all together new you look
[1:29:37] at things different it'll take that old
[1:29:43] dominating female spirit out of a woman
[1:29:46] that's a modern feminine staring at a
[1:29:48] maker into a daughter of God and she'll
[1:29:51] humble herself down to the Word of God
[1:29:53] and man it'll make a man that's not true
[1:29:56] and the great big Oh God you know that's
[1:29:58] burly and mean and you know angry and
[1:30:02] rules as brute strength and it'll make
[1:30:04] him worth it he's sweet and he's mellow
[1:30:06] and he needs his his pants his wife
[1:30:10] weight with a sweet spirit that leaves
[1:30:13] his family and then points them to
[1:30:15] Christ and they can see Jesus in them a
[1:30:19] lot of kids don't want to be a Christian
[1:30:22] cuz they don't be what they see home
[1:30:29] hello I hope you're still here
[1:30:34] some of you hung up let's reconnect you
[1:30:41] you see you stay there till all your
[1:30:45] pride is going until it takes from you
[1:30:49] the desire of seeing the world it washes
[1:30:51] all the fake off of you all the make up

[1:33:32] your rot
[1:33:33] - there's no sense of rejuvenation again
[1:33:38] no chance that that old man will ever
[1:33:41] raise up again no matter what the
[1:33:45] circumstances no matter what the trials
[1:33:47] of life he's dead and he up never rise
[1:33:52] again you stay there until God's word
[1:33:57] means more to you to your own talks
[1:33:58] until you get a hold of God and say I
[1:34:01] believe it and then there'll be
[1:34:03] something that will happen in your life
[1:34:05] a change will come upon you and your
[1:34:08] children will see it in your boss will
[1:34:12] see it in you everybody won't see it in
[1:34:14] you because you're sealed your mark you
[1:34:16] don't live is there in the old lust
[1:34:19] anymore you're dead you're buried your
[1:34:22] new creation in Christ you have a
[1:34:25] thinking man's filter and it gives you a
[1:34:27] holy man's taste filters out the world
[1:34:30] you can't it will come through God's
[1:34:32] word of his filter and man you don't
[1:34:35] live you don't look at what you see with
[1:34:37] your eyes and then the true men of God
[1:34:41] look through the eyes of faith and to
[1:34:44] make you see things different
[1:34:47] are you with me Amen faith enabled Moses
[1:34:51] to choose God's will remember although
[1:34:56] he was raised up as the son of Pharaoh's
[1:34:59] daughter he refused to that to be his
[1:35:02] identity and although we're raised up in
[1:35:06] Saint Eaton come although they you have
[1:35:09] been the product of this society
[1:35:11] remember something about a real believer
[1:35:14] he does identity I don't want to be like
[1:35:19] him I don't want them to see me like
[1:35:21] them come on I remember when I was a
[1:35:25] little boy you know a young man well
[1:35:28] Zane you was there we were in high
[1:35:30] school together and and even is a
[1:35:34] greater two older than me so we didn't
[1:35:36] really didn't see my each other much
[1:35:40] anyway when I was in school you know I
[1:35:44] the Beatles were real popular in that
[1:35:47] time and you know all the boys wear the
[1:35:49] hair with the bangs you know down I saw
[1:35:53] another young Christian I was just a
[1:35:56] young preacher boy myself but I saw this
[1:35:59] young Christian a boy you know he like
[1:36:03] come well he you know he was more of the
[1:36:06] modern kind and he took him he pull his
[1:36:09] hair just down just so much you know not
[1:36:14] not quite all the way but enough child
[1:36:16] in a fire and I looked at that and I
[1:36:22] said hmm I think I'll try that so
[1:36:28] just enough to identify boys he couldn't
[1:36:33] stand me in school come up clap me on
[1:36:36] the back
[1:36:37] Oh Tim that looks really good
[1:36:40] maybe you really fit there you know it
[1:36:44] just pull it down just a little more and
[1:36:46] you got it and I went to the bathroom
[1:36:49] right then I combed my hair because I
[1:36:53] said I don't want that identity I don't
[1:36:58] want anything that would make me
[1:37:01] accepted by the world I'm alive and I
[1:37:06] knew that was not what I wanted to be
[1:37:09] [Music]
[1:37:09] [Applause]
[1:37:13] now so you see he refused to make that
[1:37:18] his activity choosen rather is instead
[1:37:22] to suffer mistreatment with the people
[1:37:26] of God and my Moses preferred face
[1:37:30] certainty above the momentary enjoyment
[1:37:33] of sins pleasure and let me tell you a
[1:37:36] faith hansel certainty and sin has a
[1:37:39] pleasure but it only lasted for a season
[1:37:43] you ever see the Marlboro Man well it
[1:37:46] changed him up for about time because he
[1:37:48] got cancer in his lungs and the last one
[1:37:51] you know was who was suing the Marlboro
[1:37:53] cosmic company because he had cancer and
[1:37:57] he had here yet promoted you tough
[1:37:59] cowboy look you know and smoking a
[1:38:02] marble and all of that and this was a
[1:38:04] man be you know safe we'll show you the
[1:38:09] glass
[1:38:11] [Music]
[1:38:14] Wow but this tough cowboy and right
[1:38:17] marxism oh man this is the tough guy if
[1:38:20] you want to be tough you do this but I
[1:38:26] want to tell you that's not a real man a
[1:38:28] real man laughs Jesus a real man knows
[1:38:34] how to pray a real man's got back to
[1:38:37] this trouser where he kneels down and
[1:38:40] calls on this makeup a real man is a son
[1:38:43] of God that's a real man but we will not
[1:38:48] enter five with waters cool and chicken
[1:38:51] can you know what is tough and what is
[1:38:54] popular and what the world is like and a
[1:39:00] real identity is to be God that's why
[1:39:04] we're here we are to be those kind of
[1:39:07] people when they see you they say I know
[1:39:10] that boy that girl they have been with
[1:39:13] Jesus are you with me hey man and you'd
[1:39:20] rather you would rather choose the the
[1:39:25] that and suffer mistreatment with the
[1:39:29] people of God that then prefer space
[1:39:32] certainty over the momentary enjoyment
[1:39:37] of since pleasure cuz if you know it's
[1:39:41] it's enjoyable
[1:39:42] you know they mate well they tell me I
[1:39:44] never smoked but you know they they tell
[1:39:46] me you know right after you take a meal
[1:39:50] you got to have a cigarette to finish it
[1:39:53] oh and it feels so good but when you're
[1:39:56] gasping for breath and you got it in the
[1:39:59] hole in your throat you see the devil
[1:40:02] don't show you that part
[1:40:05] he shows you the glamour of it hey man
[1:40:12] so you see Moses found true wealth in
[1:40:16] separate abuse for being anointing
[1:40:20] hallelujah hey man that was his real
[1:40:24] wealth he wasn't looking at his own
[1:40:26] riches and what he what he conclude gain
[1:40:29] as being the king's son the son of
[1:40:31] Pharaoh's daughter he looked at the
[1:40:33] riches that he would receiveth for being
[1:40:37] a Titan I wonder you know I wonder today
[1:40:43] if all the favours in the world you know
[1:40:46] what they would do they would love to
[1:40:48] trade places with Moses today hey man
[1:40:54] come on hey you don't think not a
[1:40:57] Christian in this building lesser a
[1:40:59] Christian whether you make me a small
[1:41:01] Christian or a newborn Christian doesn't
[1:41:04] really matter
[1:41:05] they ain't one of you that Elvis
[1:41:07] wouldn't trade places with today are you
[1:41:13] with me a man he would forfeit his
[1:41:16] Cadillacs his weapon his fame his Psalms
[1:41:19] have all the other moods that he made
[1:41:21] and I had everything else he was
[1:41:24] all of that to sit in your place to be
[1:41:29] in this building to be able to hear this
[1:41:31] sermon to be in the presence of God to
[1:41:34] be able experience God in his life
[1:41:46] Moses eyes he would rather he looked he
[1:41:55] would look with Wonder not on the
[1:41:58] immediate what's present tense but on
[1:42:02] the ultimate what faiths great reward
[1:42:06] was Holden face a promise Moses abandon
[1:42:12] Egypt he had no favor of fear of
[1:42:14] Pharaoh's rage because
[1:42:16] he persisted in faith because he seen
[1:42:19] God who is unseen so so again you know
[1:42:23] dad there again this is Moses he look to
[1:42:27] the unseen he saw with the mind of
[1:42:30] Christ he saw what would come to Pharaoh
[1:42:34] and to his armies and they are no more
[1:42:37] but Moses is still alive he was seen
[1:42:41] about Transfiguration with Jesus Christ
[1:42:44] oh man I tell you I know he was glad on
[1:42:47] that day to say I took the mind of
[1:42:50] Christ
[1:42:50] rather than taking the mind of the world
[1:42:55] I've got his infant when God speaks it
[1:42:58] has to be perfect God cannot change we
[1:43:02] cannot all turn God's Word we have to
[1:43:05] alter our thinking to his thinking let
[1:43:08] the mind that was in Christ being you
[1:43:10] then you think like he thinks and this
[1:43:15] is what happened with Moses he took the
[1:43:17] mind of Christ he looked at what is
[1:43:19] temporary realized it would pass away
[1:43:23] but he could see that what had the
[1:43:26] eternal value you see again faith
[1:43:30] stirred Moses to perform the Rite of
[1:43:33] passive and sprinkle the lambs blood to
[1:43:36] prevent the destroyer from harming their
[1:43:39] firstborn you know I want you to get
[1:43:41] this it seems senseless it didn't make
[1:43:47] any reason it sure wasn't medicinal you
[1:43:53] know it boy you know that then the
[1:43:55] Egyptians had their back there maybe
[1:43:58] their antibiotics and they had their
[1:44:00] there thanks to three plagues and they
[1:44:02] had their medicines that we do this and
[1:44:04] you do that and as they were they have
[1:44:07] great maybe you have great knowledge cuz
[1:44:10] it is they had great knowledge for that
[1:44:12] time but Moses had a greater knowledge
[1:44:19] he could see that a laugh could take his
[1:44:23] place
[1:44:24] and died in his place and his black
[1:44:27] would be put over the dark post under of
[1:44:30] the homes and they would be safe under
[1:44:33] the bud and I'm telling you today maybe
[1:44:36] it doesn't make sense what we got maybe
[1:44:39] to the world it doesn't look like
[1:44:41] anything but I want you to know the
[1:44:43] planet Christ hallelujah is greater than
[1:44:47] all the medicinal things of the world
[1:44:49] the blood of Christ is greater than the
[1:44:53] science and the knowledge the blood of
[1:44:55] Jesus Christ opposed hardship and our
[1:44:58] sickness and the Bible is to be our
[1:45:03] ultimate what is an ultimate it's the
[1:45:06] last word it's the a man it's the end of
[1:45:09] strife
[1:45:10] it's your ultimate you may have an idea
[1:45:13] about certain things or maybe about
[1:45:16] holiness you got a certain ideas but for
[1:45:19] you you leave those idea because the
[1:45:21] word is the ultimate hey man you again
[1:45:27] you know today you can't tell her now
[1:45:29] you can't tell her that trim and her
[1:45:31] hair was wrong what what's hair got to
[1:45:33] do with it well it did this Samson make
[1:45:38] a lot of difference and then whosoever
[1:45:42] shall had one word or take one word from
[1:45:44] you got to have an ultimate somewhere
[1:45:47] you said well God won't send me to hell
[1:45:50] for cutting my hair brother Tim no he
[1:45:53] won't because he don't send people to
[1:45:55] hell
[1:45:58] help me Briggs now he not them send you
[1:46:02] to hell for cutting your hair cuz he
[1:46:03] don't send people to help a man their
[1:46:09] own unbelief and insulting their own
[1:46:12] thoughts about God's words shows that
[1:46:16] they refuse to give up their own
[1:46:18] thoughts to be born again and heaven is
[1:46:23] only for the born again
[1:46:26] [Applause]
[1:46:29] hallelujah everybody is going to heaven
[1:46:32] no only those that are falling together
[1:46:34] going to heaven the rest aren't going
[1:46:40] heaven is only for the born-again we
[1:46:43] want to make everybody you in order to
[1:46:47] see the kingdom of God you must be born
[1:46:50] again Jesus words somebody with me man
[1:46:56] so again Jesus won't send a man for hell
[1:47:01] for long hair right he won't send a
[1:47:07] woman to help her cut her hair
[1:47:08] Oprah wearing makeup or for wearing
[1:47:13] shorts or for cross-dressing
[1:47:19] but women wearing men's apparel of man
[1:47:21] whether wearing women's apparel he won't
[1:47:23] send them a handle for that you choose
[1:47:26] hell over heaven because you reject the
[1:47:30] plan of God for a new birth a new birth
[1:47:34] that would change your attitude toward
[1:47:36] God's Word a man that would give the
[1:47:39] word preeminence over y'all thinkin that
[1:47:42] you having solved in effect God's Word
[1:47:45] you see it's more II imparted what the
[1:47:49] people at work think about your school
[1:47:52] thinks about you what society thinks
[1:47:54] about you but what God thinks about you
[1:47:57] oh yeah well I know the opinions of the
[1:48:07] church world and the theologians toward
[1:48:10] holiness and even about water baptism or
[1:48:14] receiving the Holy Ghost he don't mean
[1:48:16] God don't care just as long as you say
[1:48:20] you love Jesus and Jesus said if you
[1:48:23] love me you keep my Commandments
[1:48:28] your love is shown back to God by
[1:48:31] keeping his word
[1:48:33] while I'm understanding that matter what
[1:48:35] you understand it or not what did he say
[1:48:38] what did the won't say well the illusion
[1:48:43] said this and they don't think that yeah
[1:48:45] you can go with the forty-seven thousand
[1:48:49] of them but it doesn't supersede God's
[1:48:53] Word and you can some people what's on
[1:48:56] the line and they just go right on you
[1:48:59] know because they're not gonna accept
[1:49:01] God's Word because they accept their own
[1:49:03] thinking over God's word now but if the
[1:49:13] life of Christ lives in a person they
[1:49:16] become identified with its Christ in you
[1:49:19] you're not just a church member
[1:49:22] you don't just belong just system you
[1:49:24] don't belong to just the society of a
[1:49:26] church but but it's a resurrection power
[1:49:29] it's the Holy Ghost as a token upon yet
[1:49:32] a man that just as Moses would we would
[1:49:35] say um you know you must be under the
[1:49:38] blood of the Lamb as we were as we read
[1:49:40] there just a moment ago about faith
[1:49:43] stirred him to perform the Rite of
[1:49:45] passive in this frequent of the lambs
[1:49:47] blood to prevent the destroyer from from
[1:49:51] bringing death to that home are you with
[1:49:54] me Amen the same thing today we said but
[1:49:57] you must be under the token oh that
[1:50:01] little bit of fanaticism where you know
[1:50:03] you get down and you cry and you repair
[1:50:06] and you get baptized in his name and and
[1:50:09] you come up maybe speak in another
[1:50:11] tongue or maybe you shout or your dance
[1:50:13] or maybe something happened but to
[1:50:15] whatever your changed and I'm going to
[1:50:19] tell you if she always saying that will
[1:50:21] help you to escape the death that is
[1:50:23] coming upon the world
[1:50:25] it's the only saying that I make a
[1:50:28] reality of God in your life and can make
[1:50:31] a real true Christian out of you with it
[1:50:34] you have the peace that surpasses all
[1:50:37] understanding
[1:50:39] but you see again you're not yourself
[1:50:43] anymore
[1:50:44] you're Christ you don't think your own
[1:50:46] thoughts you you don't think your
[1:50:50] thought you said ha I think I say I
[1:50:53] really don't think you don't have any
[1:50:55] thought coming now I know the modern
[1:50:58] world don't like to hear that because
[1:51:01] we're told we've got to think for
[1:51:03] ourselves and you can't if you get the
[1:51:07] mind of Christ you will think for
[1:51:09] yourself you will think just like Jesus
[1:51:12] thinks and Jesus would exalt the word
[1:51:16] over his thinking even to the death at
[1:51:19] the cross now the life that was in
[1:51:27] Christ in his in you the mind that was
[1:51:30] in Christ is in you the works it was in
[1:51:33] Christ is in you and Christ Himself is
[1:51:35] in you and your dead and your life is
[1:51:37] hidden God to Christ and your seal there
[1:51:40] by the Holy Ghost and you're not your
[1:51:42] own well I want to be my own person well
[1:51:46] you're not I said you're not
[1:51:54] well I am my own person no you're not
[1:51:57] you either belong to daughter Satan a
[1:52:01] man in every child I don't care if he
[1:52:04] was born into a message family you were
[1:52:07] born with sin nature having rule over
[1:52:10] your life and you were not your own
[1:52:15] therefore you went against everything
[1:52:17] your mom and your daddy the pastor the
[1:52:19] preaching all everything that word that
[1:52:21] you were taught you won against it come
[1:52:25] on
[1:52:26] hey man why because you're not your own
[1:52:29] st. Onge it from the start and the only
[1:52:34] way that you'll ever be different is
[1:52:37] that sin nature die and when it dies
[1:52:41] then your must have received the nature
[1:52:44] Christ into you and when you have this
[1:52:46] nature in yourself after all you're here
[1:52:58] Satan is a cruel master you say well I
[1:53:10] think again you don't have anything
[1:53:12] coming now we don't want that to hear
[1:53:15] that I tell you we're a free thinker
[1:53:17] you're not a free thinker and then you
[1:53:21] know again and a Christian he is giving
[1:53:25] up his thinking to accept the mind of
[1:53:29] Christ he and he purposed to do the will
[1:53:32] of God in fact don't do the works of God
[1:53:35] then don't believe me you see you see it
[1:53:39] must be him that it's doing the thinking
[1:53:41] you let the mind being you just the same
[1:53:45] and that's just words how are you gonna
[1:53:47] think different he's done expressed his
[1:53:50] thoughts to us but we want to do our own
[1:53:53] thinking I think we ought to do this I
[1:53:56] think this is okay I think it's all
[1:53:59] right what bit but what did the word say
[1:54:03] you see the Holy Ghost will always agree
[1:54:06] that the world is right it will never
[1:54:11] disagree with the world and to do that
[1:54:16] you've got to take the entire gospel a
[1:54:19] man with mouth we every must be
[1:54:22] identified as Full Gospel people that's
[1:54:26] a problem in the message today we don't
[1:54:28] want to be full gospel we'll take a part
[1:54:30] of the word but we don't want this part
[1:54:32] we'll take you you know the mystery part
[1:54:35] should understand in great mystery
[1:54:37] cousin exalts people's knowledge it puts
[1:54:43] them up to where that they've become
[1:54:46] arrogant people but when you're born
[1:54:51] again my knowledge has its right place
[1:54:55] and it's all the word man lives by every
[1:55:00] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[1:55:02] God so now we are invited to be molded
[1:55:06] into his image that we might reflect his
[1:55:09] presence
[1:55:10] we'll share with you a quote here from
[1:55:12] identification and the works that I do
[1:55:15] so you do also the light that I live so
[1:55:17] you so shall you we're invited by God to
[1:55:21] take him as an example and let our
[1:55:23] character be molded like this what if
[1:55:27] they did we when we let his character
[1:55:29] being us then we have become sons by
[1:55:32] having the mind of Christ mind which is
[1:55:36] Hill's character so if you have to find
[1:55:40] the Christ you have the character of
[1:55:42] Christ and the character Christ always
[1:55:44] wants to do the Father's will amen amen
[1:55:50] that we will let his character being us
[1:55:53] and we become sons by having the mind of
[1:55:55] Christ which is his character your mind
[1:55:57] makes your character does somebody get
[1:56:03] that your mind makes your character the
[1:56:09] way you think
[1:56:13] as a man thinketh in his heart so is he
[1:56:16] so your mind makes your character and if
[1:56:19] you have been born again that that mind
[1:56:21] of Christ in you will make your
[1:56:24] character it'll be the character of
[1:56:26] Christ a man
[1:56:28] let the mind whole set of Christ this
[1:56:30] mind that was in Christ being you let
[1:56:33] that mind of Christ being you it molds
[1:56:36] the character of the Son of God and his
[1:56:40] character was that he did everything to
[1:56:42] please God hello he stayed with the work
[1:56:48] he did everything that please go that's
[1:56:51] what he wanted as far we stay with God's
[1:56:54] word with find/replace
[1:56:55] and then we know where we're at we
[1:56:57] stayed with his word and to think of it
[1:56:59] we're invited to save her own character
[1:57:02] he is a man that we're going to find out
[1:57:05] what we've done we save our character to
[1:57:07] his own by his own spirit that we are
[1:57:09] the sons of God just what I've expressed
[1:57:11] by having his mind in us to shape our
[1:57:15] character to here's his mind let the
[1:57:18] mind that was in Christ being you if
[1:57:20] that mind is in you then see then he
[1:57:23] only did that which faced God he knew
[1:57:27] who he was
[1:57:27] and that's the thing do you know who you
[1:57:30] are if you know you're a son of God a
[1:57:34] man did you do that which pleases God
[1:57:37] you extreme that world even above your
[1:57:40] necessary food and then it's the most
[1:57:43] important thing for you in your life
[1:57:46] what the word said you're gonna do it
[1:57:49] a man now the word modes God's character
[1:57:56] to us and anything that tries to mix
[1:57:59] with that character breaks the mold you
[1:58:01] can't mix Creed with the word you can't
[1:58:04] mix the world with the word you can't
[1:58:06] serve God and Mammon that's the world a
[1:58:09] man you can't be one or the other if you
[1:58:13] love the world of the things the world
[1:58:15] the love of God's not even idiot you see
[1:58:18] you can't mix it you can't mix all in
[1:58:20] water it won't mix you can turn it up
[1:58:23] and down do
[1:58:23] you only won't mix and your character
[1:58:26] will not mix with the world if your men
[1:58:28] aren't been loaded and they inform of
[1:58:30] God by letting the mind that was in
[1:58:33] Christ being you hey man that's the
[1:58:37] control tower so now you're not
[1:58:40] controlled by the world
[1:58:41] you're controlled by what's in the heart
[1:58:44] any controls your attitude and you have
[1:58:48] the same attitude towards sin as Jesus
[1:58:52] had hallelujah hey man did that attitude
[1:58:58] in lives out in your life it shows
[1:59:01] itself to the world that Jesus Christ is
[1:59:04] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:59:06] it changes your character it makes you a
[1:59:11] new person in Christ a man now he has
[1:59:17] delivered you out of the authority of
[1:59:19] darkness let me just bring it down Sam
[1:59:22] now has no more dominion over a man he
[1:59:28] has recreated your spirit and now he's
[1:59:32] ready to renew your mind so you can
[1:59:34] understand your privileges and rights in
[1:59:37] Christ it belongs to you you have a
[1:59:40] right to it hallelu so now you take the
[1:59:45] word over your feelings of your thoughts
[1:59:48] over your reasoning over what science
[1:59:50] says over what the PhD the ideal whoever
[1:59:54] they are the doctors say it doesn't
[1:59:56] really matter you take God's Word and it
[1:59:59] has preeminence in your life it means
[2:00:02] more than any other thing and you just
[2:00:05] say take this whole world but give me
[2:00:08] Jesus hey what's a musician's to come
[2:00:18] we're going to take this another step
[2:00:20] forward in our next service I've
[2:00:23] established it now you have the mind of
[2:00:26] Christ
[2:00:27] you have the Holy Ghost in you and the
[2:00:30] Holy Ghost brings your flesh in
[2:00:32] obedience to the Word of God amen
[2:00:36] now then I tell you if you see your life
[2:00:39] is separate from the word and you're not
[2:00:41] doing what the word says then you know
[2:00:43] he doesn't have preeminence and I want
[2:00:46] you just to begin to look at it and say
[2:00:49] Lord changed me to fit that image don't
[2:00:52] let me remain the same a man we just bow
