[43:18] person has come home different they come
[43:20] home changed they come home look they
[43:22] went into a battleground but they come
[43:24] home with a victory and it's up to us to

[44:10] maketh my feet like hein's feet and he
[44:13] setted me upon
[44:14] my high places
[44:16] notice david didn't exalt himself
[44:19] to the high places god set him there
[44:22] he teaches my hands to war so that a bow
[44:25] of steel is broken by my arms thou hast
[44:28] also given me the shield of thy
[44:30] salvation and thy gentleness gentleness
[44:33] had made me great
[44:34] thou hast enlarged my steps under me so
[44:37] that my feet did not slip i have pursued
[44:41] my enemies
[44:42] young person i'm going to be speaking to
[44:44] you tonight
[44:45] this message tonight is directed to our
[44:47] youth and their return from the battle
[44:50] i have pursued my enemies and destroyed
[44:52] them notice they didn't destroy you
[44:55] we destroyed them and turned not again
[44:58] until i had consumed them and i have
[45:00] consumed them and wounded them that they
[45:03] could not arise yea they are falling
[45:05] under my feet for thou has girded me
[45:08] with strength to battle them that rose
[45:11] up against me that i have subdued under
[45:13] me that has also given me the necks of
[45:16] my enemies that i might destroy them
[45:19] that hate me they looked but there was
[45:21] none to save even unto the lord but he
[45:24] answered them not
[45:26] you know you got your enemy in a
[45:27] predicament when he's calling out to
[45:29] your god for help
[45:31] well but i want you to know they didn't
[45:33] your god didn't answer them then and he
[45:35] ain't going to answer your enemy today
[45:37] and he says i beat them down small as a
[45:40] duster of the earth i did stamp them as
[45:42] the mire of the street and i spread them
[45:45] abroad that's what you got to do with
[45:47] your enemy you beat them down and you
[45:50] bring them to dust and you just spread
[45:51] it all over the place
[45:53] [Applause]
[45:54] hallelujah you can have your seats
[45:56] tonight
[45:57] i'm a little excited i'm a little bit
[45:58] jacked up tonight
[46:00] oh my i believe we we i want to speak to
[46:03] you tonight on returning from the battle
[46:06] i don't think we got to return from the
[46:08] battle all down in the wowzy wilds and
[46:10] wolves all defeated and depressed and
[46:12] beat down and beat up no i think when we
[46:14] went to battle i think that's what we
[46:15] did this past week is we sent our young
[46:18] people into battle but i believe church
[46:20] tonight that the young people are coming
[46:22] home they're returning from the battle
[46:24] not beat down not destroyed not forsaken
[46:27] oh they've been persecuted but they're
[46:29] still standing looking young person you
[46:31] have fought a great fight but you're
[46:33] here tonight you're still standing when
[46:35] the devil said you weren't going to make
[46:36] it you're here tonight he said there was
[46:38] no use of crime you're here tonight
[46:43] see we look at these scriptures right
[46:44] here and we find david gives an
[46:46] overwhelming uh resound to the word of
[46:49] god or to god's praise and god's glory
[46:51] because see david knew what it meant to
[46:53] go to battle
[46:54] david didn't have all this to say about
[46:57] god because life was easy and life was a
[46:59] little bit you know he had everything
[47:01] that he wanted it was free from
[47:02] suffering and it was free from from pain
[47:05] but david learned to trust god in the
[47:08] struggles david learned to trust god in
[47:11] each and every battle that he faced he
[47:13] leaned from god he knew that it would be
[47:15] god that would send him out to battle it
[47:17] will be god that will sustain him during
[47:19] the battle and it will be god that would
[47:21] go with him returning from the battle
[47:23] what am i telling you tonight we heard a
[47:25] word last wednesday night it was a word
[47:27] it was it was a precursor it was a
[47:29] battle flag flying look you're going
[47:31] into battle but i want you to know just
[47:33] as well as you're going into battle the
[47:35] same god that's leading you it's gonna
[47:37] be the same god that's gonna meet you
[47:39] there and let me tell you you ain't
[47:40] gonna leave him in ohio camp he came
[47:43] home with you tonight he's here with you
[47:45] tonight you have returned from the
[47:47] battle and you didn't come empty-handed
[47:49] [Applause]
[47:52] see he learned what god was in his
[47:54] suffering he learned that god would
[47:56] sustain him
[47:58] in his battles he found
[48:00] god to be his necessity
[48:02] even in his dangers
[48:06] think about this many times
[48:09] we look at others
[48:10] and we
[48:11] desire maybe to have
[48:13] their testimony
[48:16] i mean who wouldn't want brother tim's
[48:18] testimony right
[48:19] a profound preacher
[48:21] from preaching for over 50 years passing
[48:23] over 50 years
[48:25] but look what it took to get to that
[48:26] point
[48:28] crippled feet
[48:29] when other boys were out playing games
[48:31] he was in there studying the word
[48:34] pouring himself over the word he stood
[48:36] against family he stood he didn't
[48:38] compromise on the things that were of
[48:40] god he stayed true and faithful to the
[48:43] word and now he's lifted up to a stature
[48:46] and look and we find many people many
[48:49] young ministers they idolize they want
[48:51] that but they don't know the struggle
[48:53] that it took to get there
[48:54] and a lot of times we want somebody
[48:56] else's testimony we want somebody we
[48:58] want to be oh a strong christian like
[49:01] that brother or like that system but
[49:03] what am i telling you it took the
[49:04] battles to get there it took the
[49:06] difficult times to get there it didn't
[49:08] just happen god just just didn't throw
[49:10] that on them no they've been in the
[49:12] trenches
[49:13] and they learned to trust god
[49:16] they learn
[49:18] that god will sustain them
[49:20] see it's god that sets man up and sets
[49:23] man down
[49:25] see we find many times we want a great
[49:27] testimony
[49:28] and you will have a great testimony
[49:31] and young people you do have a great
[49:32] testimony and if we're going to be
[49:34] anything in this life it's because god's
[49:36] hand is upon us
[49:38] because you remain courageous in the
[49:41] midst of your storm because you remain
[49:43] faithful in the midst of your battle you
[49:45] trusted god when you didn't see him you
[49:47] trusted god when you didn't hear them
[49:48] you trusted god when you didn't feel
[49:50] them you trusted god and kept marching
[49:52] on
[49:54] well the brother they would ask brother
[49:56] ben a question why do we why why does
[49:58] god allow troubles to come how many
[50:00] would like that answer
[50:02] because a lot of times we don't enjoy
[50:03] trouble zooey
[50:05] come on just get with me a little bit
[50:06] tonight it's okay
[50:08] this is home so let's just have church
[50:09] tonight he said god harnesses trouble
[50:12] put bits in his mouth and makes it obey
[50:15] him and those troubles bring you into a
[50:18] closer fellowship with god
[50:21] and you think you're just being out
[50:22] there it's god punishing you and you
[50:24] know satan's trying to destroy you know
[50:26] god permits these things so that he can
[50:28] bring you into a closer fellowship a
[50:31] closer relationship so god can tender
[50:33] his hand to you and show you that he
[50:35] loves you you know the little story
[50:37] about the lamb or the sheep there in the
[50:39] the shepherd had to break the little
[50:41] sheep's leg so that he can put him on
[50:43] his shoulders and carry him
[50:45] and sometimes god does that for us
[50:48] he allows troubles to come but the trial
[50:51] the struggle the battle that we're in is
[50:53] not for our destruction but it's to
[50:54] bring us into a more intimate fellowship
[50:57] with god
[50:58] and we find david knew god in a great
[51:01] way
[51:02] he knew it was god that girded him with
[51:04] strength for the battle he knew it was
[51:06] god that brought him to each and every
[51:08] victory and subdued his enemies under
[51:10] his feet he trusted and believed that it
[51:13] was god that destroyed every enemy that
[51:16] he faced
[51:18] he wasn't man's idea what man's doctor
[51:21] wasn't man's belief it was god
[51:24] and see
[51:25] and he's the same god for you tonight
[51:28] he's the same god for you young people
[51:30] he's the same god for you older people
[51:32] he's the gangs and god for you
[51:33] middle-aged people he's the same god he
[51:36] girds us for the battle and he gives us
[51:38] our enemies he subdues our enemies under
[51:40] our feet and therefore david could say
[51:42] he is my rock he is my fortress he is my
[51:46] deliverer notice david pakken he's
[51:47] packing one title after another title
[51:49] after another title so david knew that
[51:52] god was a god of deliverance he knew
[51:54] that god delivered from the line and god
[51:56] delivered from the bear and god
[51:58] delivered from goliath and god delivered
[52:00] from saul and god kept him from
[52:01] backslide and god kept him from israel's
[52:03] enemies and god kept him from his own
[52:05] son absalom and god kept him from his
[52:07] own sinful passion he knew what it meant
[52:09] to believe and sin and a living god that
[52:12] would sustain him through every
[52:14] situation
[52:17] and i believe he could easily trust in
[52:19] this god
[52:21] he's my rock he's my fortress he's my
[52:24] deliverer he's my shield he's my
[52:26] stronghold he's my savior
[52:29] oh my when we start looking at god like
[52:30] that it's easy to trust him
[52:33] he start putting accolations on god and
[52:35] start adoring him and and reverencing
[52:38] him and what he is to you you'll see god
[52:40] in a different light
[52:42] hoping many times what we want to do is
[52:44] we want to we want to give praise to the
[52:46] enemy or we want to give give voice to
[52:47] the enemy oh i got this doubt and i got
[52:50] this depression and well we're always in
[52:52] the wowzy wilds it's time that we
[52:54] silence the voice of the enemy and start
[52:56] giving praise to almighty god it's god
[52:58] that is keeping us in the battle
[53:01] see david learned to trust god in his
[53:03] youth
[53:06] he didn't wait till he was older to
[53:07] serve god
[53:09] he meditated on god day and night while
[53:12] he was out hurting the sheep see he had
[53:14] a relationship
[53:16] and he cultivated that relationship when
[53:18] he was on the back side of the desert
[53:20] all alone
[53:21] with nothing but a sling in his hand but
[53:22] yet he thought about god
[53:24] what is god who is god
[53:27] and when the lion came in and a bear
[53:29] came in to take a little sheep david ran
[53:32] after him
[53:34] and snatched the sheep from his mouth
[53:36] and when he rose up against him he took
[53:38] him by the beard and slit his throat and
[53:39] destroyed him why he trusted in god he
[53:43] knew that god called him to that
[53:44] position
[53:46] notice not only that but david believed
[53:49] that the same god that kept him from the
[53:51] line and from the bear is also the same
[53:53] god that would keep him from giants
[53:57] see god was just allowing his servant to
[53:59] be trained
[54:00] now i don't know about you but i don't
[54:02] want to meet a bear i don't want to meet
[54:03] a lion
[54:05] no matter how big or small
[54:07] much less of goliath but many of you
[54:09] have faced lines in your lives your
[54:11] faith bears in your lives your faith to
[54:13] lies in your life and yet you're still
[54:15] here tonight
[54:17] yeah you're still standing tonight yet
[54:19] you're still victorious tonight
[54:21] you can look back over your life and
[54:23] seen where god's hand and his provision
[54:25] has been on you the whole time church
[54:27] and david learned this about god that
[54:29] god that kept me then is the god that's
[54:32] going to keep me now this god will keep
[54:33] me in each and every battle this god
[54:35] will still do each and every enemy under
[54:37] my feet i trusted him then i'll trust
[54:40] him now i trusted him last week in ohio
[54:42] i'll trust him on the wednesday night
[54:44] i'll trust god tomorrow i'll trust him
[54:46] if i have cancer i'll trust him if i had
[54:48] sugar diabetes i'll trust him if i
[54:51] would trust this guy because he's seen
[54:53] me in every way
[54:57] see he experienced battle after battle
[55:01] and he had victory after victory
[55:04] he knew what it was to see casualties of
[55:06] war
[55:08] he felt the agony of disappointments
[55:11] he faced his share of failures
[55:14] he was just like you a man
[55:18] nothing more
[55:19] nothing less
[55:22] actually he was anointed by god
[55:26] but you're anointed with god
[55:30] and that david
[55:31] can stack on all this
[55:33] title after title of what god was him
[55:36] only by an anointing on the flesh what
[55:39] about you and i with the anointing on
[55:40] the inside of us
[55:43] not this flesh being anointed but our
[55:45] souls our lives being in order our lives
[55:47] being changed our homes being changed
[55:50] our jobs being changed everything about
[55:53] us being changed not because man's idea
[55:56] not because of theology not because of
[55:58] psychology but because the word of god
[56:00] has come down and rooted and burned out
[56:03] all
[56:04] darkness and unbelief
[56:07] but david also knew how to rejoice
[56:10] in victory
[56:15] david knew what it meant to bring the
[56:17] ark of the covenant back home
[56:20] and maybe he had some church goers in
[56:22] his church
[56:23] they criticized a little bit all that
[56:25] moving about all that emotion all that
[56:28] can't we just sit there and just bring
[56:30] the ark and put it back in this place
[56:35] and sometimes if we're not careful
[56:38] that's the attitude that we have when we
[56:40] see a little wildfire take place
[56:44] a little bit of fire happened in our
[56:46] young people
[56:48] oh
[56:49] but the problem is you don't know
[56:52] what they know
[56:55] you should have been there
[56:57] on a thursday night
[56:59] when the holy ghost dropped down and
[57:00] started dealing with hearts and life you
[57:01] should have been there on a friday night
[57:04] oh well there's too emotional there to
[57:06] this you should have been there on a
[57:08] saturday when chains fell off and all
[57:10] the heaven came behind him you should
[57:12] have been there on a sunday morning when
[57:15] he said let's make it a real fight let's
[57:17] make it a good fight you should have
[57:19] been there and if you were there you
[57:20] could say like him oh you don't know
[57:22] what kind of what my god done for me he
[57:26] brought me out of darkness he put me
[57:28] into the light he broke complexes off of
[57:30] me he broke fear out from he destroyed
[57:32] depression you don't know like i know
[57:35] i'm free tonight that's what i know
[57:40] i know i'm free to worship i know i'm
[57:42] free to rejoice and david knew how to
[57:45] rejoice in victory
[57:47] the problem is you ain't got enough
[57:49] victory it's time to experience some
[57:52] victory rejoice in your god
[57:56] rejoice in your savior rejoice in your
[57:58] redeemer praise the living god for what
[58:01] he has done for you
[58:09] he was jubilant
[58:11] with praise and thanksgiving
[58:14] when returning
[58:16] from the battle
[58:18] i don't think he came back defeated
[58:20] actually they said david fought 60 66
[58:23] battles and he never lost a one
[58:28] oh come on i'm looking at some davids
[58:32] i'm looking at some davids
[58:34] on the wednesday night in a battle
[58:37] but there's no fear of defeat
[58:40] oh david could say
[58:42] as for god his way is perfect
[58:44] he's all together blameless
[58:46] for who is god saved the lord who is the
[58:49] rock saver god for he is my strength and
[58:53] my power he is my fortress of my
[58:55] strength oh he make my feet like hein's
[58:58] feet otherwise he makes my feet swift in
[59:01] strength and in pursuit of the enemies
[59:03] he teaches
[59:05] my hands
[59:06] to war
[59:09] you don't do these things with the mind
[59:10] of a man but god teaches your hand
[59:13] teaches you how to bend the bow
[59:16] teaches you it's god that teaches us
[59:18] these things see thou has given me thy
[59:20] shield of thy salvation it's god that
[59:22] protects and saves his people he has
[59:24] enlarged my steps
[59:26] under me
[59:28] god has made it your platform so big you
[59:31] don't have to worry about stumbling
[59:34] you don't have to worry about missing it
[59:36] you don't have to worry about falling
[59:38] you don't have to worry about the bus
[59:39] ride back well i ain't going to get it
[59:42] no he made your platform big enough you
[59:44] ain't got to worry about nothing you
[59:46] just keep on walking you keep on
[59:48] stepping be like oh the the prayer of
[59:50] your bed lord increase my borders god it
[59:54] ain't enough room in here tonight i need
[59:56] more victory i need more of the glory of
[59:58] god i need more tonight god enlarge my
[1:00:01] borders lord i believe in you tonight
[1:00:03] god
[1:00:04] [Applause]
[1:00:08] so thou has also given me the next of my
[1:00:10] enemies
[1:00:11] not my neck to them but their neck to us
[1:00:15] then i beat them down small as the dust
[1:00:17] of the earth
[1:00:18] pulverized them scattered them stamped
[1:00:21] them as though they were just mire of
[1:00:22] the street and i spread
[1:00:25] them abroad
[1:00:28] let that sit there for a minute
[1:00:31] let that just set there in your mind
[1:00:32] just for a minute pulverize them
[1:00:35] scatter them
[1:00:37] i did stamp them as a mire of the street
[1:00:41] and i did spread them abroad
[1:00:44] well church if you got an enemy tonight
[1:00:46] that's what your enemy needs to look
[1:00:48] like
[1:00:49] see by these scriptures we can conclude
[1:00:51] that david knew how to trust god
[1:00:54] in battle
[1:00:56] and he gives credit to the lord for his
[1:00:58] going in and is going out
[1:01:01] see he was courageous
[1:01:03] his faith was built on nothing less
[1:01:06] than jesus christ
[1:01:08] and his righteousness
[1:01:10] he believed for victory
[1:01:12] see he was leaning on the everlasting
[1:01:15] arm of jehovah he wasn't leaning on his
[1:01:18] own ability
[1:01:19] and many times that's what man does they
[1:01:22] lean on their own ability
[1:01:24] we're not looking at the ability of a
[1:01:26] man to like we're looking at the
[1:01:27] anointing of the holy spirit
[1:01:30] and david knew what it meant
[1:01:32] to push the sword to the heart of the
[1:01:34] enemy he knew what it meant to allow god
[1:01:38] to teach him how to fight
[1:01:41] and that's why we come to the house of
[1:01:42] god it's why we come to the church
[1:01:44] that's why we feed on the things of god
[1:01:46] because we want to say like david lord
[1:01:48] teaches my hands to war
[1:01:50] teach me to fight help me be skillful in
[1:01:53] battle father the prophet of god will
[1:01:55] tell us we're not on a picnic
[1:01:59] no we're in a battlefield
[1:02:01] so many people just think when they
[1:02:02] become a christian that's all that they
[1:02:04] and they need to do that settles it
[1:02:06] forever he says as they are christian
[1:02:09] and everything's going to come easy he
[1:02:10] says don't never get that in your head
[1:02:14] church we're in a battle
[1:02:16] we're in a battle we've become both says
[1:02:18] i become a christian to fight
[1:02:21] fight the good fight of faith
[1:02:25] come on i should be a little bit more
[1:02:26] amen than that
[1:02:27] i know it's wednesday night i know we
[1:02:29] don't want to talk about fighting in
[1:02:30] trials because oh man if i start talking
[1:02:32] about it i'ma have one tomorrow morning
[1:02:37] so what am i saying i'm saying we can't
[1:02:38] take psychology and expect to defeat the
[1:02:40] enemy we can't take some second-handed
[1:02:43] experience and expect to defeat the
[1:02:45] enemy we can't take some denominational
[1:02:48] view or some man's idea and expect to
[1:02:51] defeat the enemy we must take the word
[1:02:54] and that word anointed by the spirit of
[1:02:57] almighty god and line the two up and
[1:03:00] then when you face your demon when you
[1:03:02] face that enemy when you're in the midst
[1:03:04] of your battle then you can have
[1:03:06] confidence that the word will never fail
[1:03:09] you it has never failed in the mouth of
[1:03:11] a believer if it never failed then it
[1:03:14] won't fail you tonight you can put those
[1:03:16] words on your lips tonight and it's just
[1:03:19] the same as deity speaking it's just the
[1:03:22] same as god saying let there be all that
[1:03:25] you've got to do is find that anointing
[1:03:27] find that word and release your prayer
[1:03:29] lease your faith tonight don't believe
[1:03:31] that whatsoever you ask god said he'll
[1:03:33] do it for you tonight
[1:03:36] well that said you got to fight for
[1:03:37] every inch

[1:23:12] that for you
[1:23:13] but you went to a battleground
[1:23:15] and you fought
[1:23:17] you waged war spiritual warfare
[1:23:20] in the face of the enemy and he was

[1:24:05] and sunday morning after heaven turned
[1:24:07] loose on you god equipped you with
[1:24:09] fighting power we're gonna make this a
[1:24:12] good fight
[1:24:13] and now wednesday we get to return home
[1:24:16] from the battle
[1:24:18] god doesn't make mistakes and last
[1:24:20] wednesday the banner was going before
[1:24:22] you
[1:24:23] god was waving that banner saying i'm
[1:24:25] going not only before you but i'm going
[1:24:28] with you i'm going gonna be in you i'll
[1:24:30] meet you in the prayer line i'll meet

[1:24:38] are the colors right here oh you may get
[1:24:40] down but look up see the colors it's
[1:24:42] still waving we're still winning we
[1:24:45] ain't been beat yet we haven't been
[1:24:46] defeated yet this word has never lost a
[1:24:49] defeat this word will defeat satan
[1:24:52] anytime anywhere on any crowd under any
[1:24:55] condition what does he doing going
[1:24:58] before us tonight telling you you're
[1:25:00] still in the battle keep moving keep
[1:25:02] marching
[1:25:09] for them says
[1:25:11] when a man takes god at his word brother
[1:25:14] that'll kill satan every time
[1:25:17] that's the death stroke
[1:25:19] oh my god
[1:25:23] that's the death stroke anyway he said
[1:25:26] that's the hardest hit that satan can
[1:25:28] get when the man will take god at his
[1:25:30] word he says they tell me when a plane
[1:25:33] really breaks a sound bear there's no
[1:25:35] limit to its speed
[1:25:36] because when you break that traditional
[1:25:38] barrier that jesus was back there then
[1:25:41] he isn't now when you find that he's the
[1:25:43] same yesterday today and forever there's
[1:25:45] no limit to what god can do right here
[1:25:48] in this convention when people get to
[1:25:50] hunger in their heart that the veil is
[1:25:52] ready to be broke you can just depend on
[1:25:54] that rent every veil by the holy spirit
[1:25:57] and he stands here tonight the mighty
[1:26:00] conqueror the same yesterday today and
[1:26:02] forever healing the sick baptizing the
[1:26:05] believers just as he did then he's the
[1:26:08] mighty conqueror now doom devils are on
[1:26:10] the run what am i telling you the same
[1:26:12] god that met you last week is here
[1:26:15] tonight and dude devils were on the run
[1:26:17] then and they're on the run tonight you
[1:26:20] can't lose young person
[1:26:23] oh the bible says if god be for us that
[1:26:27] who can be against us oh you can't lose
[1:26:30] you've got a winning proposition
[1:26:35] first john and four and four
[1:26:37] you are of god little children and have
[1:26:39] overcome him
[1:26:42] already past tense
[1:26:45] because greater is he that is in you
[1:26:47] than he that is in the world
[1:26:50] see matthew 16 and verse 18
[1:26:53] and i say unto thee also the thou art
[1:26:55] peter and upon this rock i'll build my
[1:26:58] church
[1:26:59] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:27:01] against it see the church is not a
[1:27:02] building the church is a people
[1:27:05] and god is building his church
[1:27:08] and the gates of hell cannot prevail
[1:27:09] against you tonight
[1:27:12] oh notice
[1:27:14] we got we can go on and on and on
[1:27:18] see them he's going to come back to some
[1:27:19] of you
[1:27:20] he's going to try to steal away what god
[1:27:22] did for you this weekend
[1:27:25] he's going to lie to you
[1:27:27] but don't entertain his lies
[1:27:29] don't you stop for one second
[1:27:32] he was defeated
[1:27:34] and he is defeated
[1:27:36] and he remains defeated
[1:27:38] but as soon as you open up and entertain
[1:27:41] that lie his defeat is over
[1:27:44] keep him under your
[1:27:46] feet
[1:27:48] but lebron makes a statement here in
[1:27:49] search we receive jesus he says we don't
[1:27:52] back up
[1:27:56] if you don't like fighting
[1:27:57] and you don't like loud noise you don't
[1:28:00] like jubilee you don't like worshiping
[1:28:02] god
[1:28:03] maybe you're in the wrong place
[1:28:06] there's a baptist church about three
[1:28:07] miles down the road
[1:28:10] oh but we ain't backing up
[1:28:14] come on somebody i said we ain't backing
[1:28:16] up
[1:28:17] we ain't stopping
[1:28:19] and we ain't losing
[1:28:22] oh my
[1:28:23] the land belongs to us and we're going
[1:28:26] to get it now how many wants victory
[1:28:29] tonight
[1:28:31] probably god said if you want victory
[1:28:32] then you got to have a battle
[1:28:34] oh i raised my hand too soon
[1:28:37] what was i thinking brother joe that was
[1:28:38] not nice that was trickery
[1:28:40] he said before you can have victory
[1:28:42] there has to be a battle and there if
[1:28:45] there is no battles then there is no
[1:28:46] victory so we ought to be thankful
[1:28:49] for the battles
[1:28:51] and the tryings and it's god given us
[1:28:53] notice given us the opportunities to
[1:28:56] have victories
[1:28:59] see if there was no war then there would
[1:29:01] be no victory and all things are
[1:29:03] possible
[1:29:04] to them
[1:29:06] to them that believe
[1:29:08] see no matter what the odds are
[1:29:11] we believe
[1:29:13] the bible would tell us in romans 8 and
[1:29:15] verse 33 who shall lay anything to the
[1:29:17] charge of god elect it is god that
[1:29:18] justified who is he that condemneth that
[1:29:21] is christ that has died yet rather that
[1:29:23] has risen again who is even at the right
[1:29:25] hand of god who also maketh intercession
[1:29:28] for us who shall separate us from the
[1:29:30] love of christ shall tribulation
[1:29:33] or distress
[1:29:35] or persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:29:38] peril or sword
[1:29:41] he says as it is written for thy sake we
[1:29:43] are killed all the lay long we are
[1:29:45] counted as sheep for the slaughter nay
[1:29:48] but in all things we are more than
[1:29:50] conquerors
[1:29:52] i'm not talking to losers
[1:29:54] i'm talking to conquerors tonight
[1:29:57] see we have nothing to fear god has
[1:29:59] promised that he would never leave us
[1:30:02] he would never forsake us
[1:30:04] and god doesn't pull back
[1:30:06] in the heat of the battle but he
[1:30:08] reinforces
[1:30:10] and reinforces
[1:30:12] if you go back and look at the order of
[1:30:13] the services he was reinforcing
[1:30:16] and reinforcing
[1:30:18] from wednesday till today he was
[1:30:20] reinforcing and reinforcing
[1:30:23] standard lifted
[1:30:25] stirred your remembrance about a living
[1:30:27] god who he was never leaving never
[1:30:29] forsake you
[1:30:30] broke the chains off of you
[1:30:32] all heaven came back behind it
[1:30:34] and turned loose on your behalf
[1:30:37] then he encouraged you the last message
[1:30:40] is to fight
[1:30:42] to fight a good fight to fight a real
[1:30:44] fight
[1:30:45] and when the fight's over then we'll
[1:30:47] return home from battle
[1:30:50] the bible will tell us in romans 12
[1:30:52] that there was war in heaven and michael
[1:30:54] and his angels fought against a dragon
[1:30:56] and dragon fought against his angels and
[1:30:58] they prevailed not
[1:31:00] and neither was her place found any more
[1:31:02] in heaven and the great dragon was cast
[1:31:04] out the old serpent called the devil and
[1:31:06] satan was deceived the whole world he
[1:31:08] was cast out into the earth and his
[1:31:10] angels were cast out with him and i
[1:31:11] heard a loud voice saying in heaven now
[1:31:13] has come salvation and strength
[1:31:17] a loud voice
[1:31:19] i think it was a voice of rejoicing
[1:31:22] now has come salvation
[1:31:24] now has come strength now the kingdom of
[1:31:27] our god and the power of his christ for
[1:31:29] the accuser of the brother is cast down
[1:31:31] which accused him before god day and
[1:31:33] night and they overcame him by the blood
[1:31:35] of the lamb and by the word of their
[1:31:37] testimony and they loved not their lives
[1:31:39] unto death therefore
[1:31:42] rejoice if heaven can rejoice
[1:31:46] because of their victory
[1:31:48] shouldn't we be able to rejoice for our
[1:31:50] victory
[1:31:52] come on grandma
[1:31:53] grandpa
[1:31:54] can't you rejoice for your grand
[1:31:56] grandkids
[1:31:58] mom and dad
[1:32:00] maybe you don't have a kid present but
[1:32:02] you can still rejoice
[1:32:04] in the victory
[1:32:06] because that victory wasn't just their
[1:32:07] victory that's our victory
[1:32:11] it's our victory
[1:32:13] all heaven rejoice shouldn't we be able
[1:32:15] to rejoice
[1:32:17] first chronicles 26 and verse 27 as we
[1:32:19] start wrapping this up
[1:32:21] no i'm not going to be done by 8 30. i'm
[1:32:22] just going to tell you
[1:32:24] maybe 9 o'clock maybe 9 30 maybe 10.
[1:32:30] since out of the spoils won in battles
[1:32:33] did they dedicate to maintain the house
[1:32:36] of the lord
[1:32:38] so out of the spoils
[1:32:41] that are won in battle
[1:32:43] did they dedicate to maintain
[1:32:45] the house of the lord see spoils of war
[1:32:49] are plunder
[1:32:51] loot
[1:32:52] goods taken in battle by the victors not
[1:32:55] the losers the first time this word
[1:32:58] spoils was ever mentioned in the bible
[1:33:00] is in genesis 14
[1:33:02] when those kings came down to sodom and
[1:33:04] gomorrah and took lot and took all the
[1:33:06] solomon all gemara and when abraham
[1:33:09] found out that his nephew was taken
[1:33:13] abraham and 318 men went down let's look
[1:33:17] at this just for a minute could you just
[1:33:19] imagine all these kings they're
[1:33:21] rejoicing they got it they got lot
[1:33:23] they got to see lionel abraham some of
[1:33:26] his offspring here we got it we got all
[1:33:27] the women we got all the children
[1:33:29] everything we got it all here we got the
[1:33:31] entire two cities
[1:33:34] devil's rejoicing and that's the way it
[1:33:36] was with some of you before camp
[1:33:38] he was rejoicing man i got them with
[1:33:40] depression i got them with suicide i got
[1:33:42] them with fear i got them with
[1:33:44] inferiority complexes i got them with
[1:33:47] superiority complexes i got them man i
[1:33:50] got them all right here
[1:33:54] see satan had taken lot of spoil and
[1:33:57] along with the vast herds and wagon
[1:33:58] loads of food and clothing chest full of
[1:34:00] gold silver and precious stone see the
[1:34:02] devil was boasting of his capture of
[1:34:03] abraham's seed look at lot he's bound
[1:34:06] and changed and stripped of all his
[1:34:08] goods and that's exactly what satan does
[1:34:10] to us
[1:34:12] but it ain't over yet
[1:34:15] god has the final saying now we find
[1:34:18] abraham he goes down and he frees and he
[1:34:22] frees and rescues lot and he rescues all
[1:34:24] of them and he returns everything back
[1:34:26] to even to the shoe latch of sodom and
[1:34:28] gomorrah but all the spoils went to
[1:34:31] abraham
[1:34:32] what am i telling you tonight church the
[1:34:34] bible will tell us that what know you
[1:34:36] not that you are the temple of the lord
[1:34:39] and the spoils and victory are used to
[1:34:41] maintain the house of god and every time
[1:34:44] you go forth in the battle and you win
[1:34:46] and you're the victory you come back
[1:34:48] pack and spawn what is that for that's
[1:34:50] to maintain the house of god that's to
[1:34:53] maintain the church that's to maintain
[1:34:55] the believer we don't come back pack is
[1:34:57] false for ourselves but we come back so
[1:34:59] that even the light can rejoice so that
[1:35:01] the world can rejoice that our young
[1:35:03] people they got the victory and here are
[1:35:06] the spoils of war and what they do it
[1:35:09] helps maintain our cause that's why
[1:35:11] we're here that's why we preach the
[1:35:13] gospel that's why we believe because we
[1:35:15] know god is raising up children to
[1:35:18] defeat the enemy
[1:35:21] our trials are not meant just to be our
[1:35:23] survival
[1:35:24] but god is wanting to enrich our lives
[1:35:29] with resources
[1:35:31] and wealth
[1:35:32] and he wants to stockpile
[1:35:34] treasures on your life
[1:35:37] faith
[1:35:38] on top of faith
[1:35:39] on top of faith
[1:35:41] stacking
[1:35:42] lying upon line precept on precept
[1:35:46] victory upon victory
[1:35:49] to build us
[1:35:51] up
[1:35:52] he says i'm going to have a church
[1:35:53] brother without spot without blemish
[1:35:57] how does he do it
[1:35:58] he builds her up
[1:36:00] through victories of war
[1:36:04] as we bring this down to a close first
[1:36:05] samuel 30
[1:36:06] and this is a very familiar scripture
[1:36:09] and it came to pass when david and his
[1:36:10] men were coming to ziglag on the third
[1:36:12] day
[1:36:13] that the amalekites had invaded the
[1:36:15] south and ziglag is smitten and they had
[1:36:17] smitten ziglag and they burned it with
[1:36:18] fire and they'd taken the women captive
[1:36:21] and
[1:36:22] that were therein and they slew not any
[1:36:24] either great or small but they carried
[1:36:27] them away and they went
[1:36:28] on their way so david and his men came
[1:36:30] to the city and they behold it was
[1:36:31] burned with fire
[1:36:32] and their wives and their sons and their
[1:36:34] daughters were taken captive notice this
[1:36:36] was a
[1:36:37] spiritual battle
[1:36:39] not only a physical battle because see
[1:36:42] the sea lion was going to come down
[1:36:43] through david's
[1:36:44] gene
[1:36:46] and now
[1:36:47] the enemy determined to cut that
[1:36:49] seedline off
[1:36:50] so he takes all the women
[1:36:52] takes all the children
[1:36:54] and that's what satan's determined is to
[1:36:55] destroy the seedline
[1:36:58] to destroy the youth
[1:37:01] cut off
[1:37:02] to seed
[1:37:04] see the mickey was going to come through
[1:37:05] david's descendants so taken so satan
[1:37:08] had taken every woman child that that
[1:37:10] seed might come through see he was
[1:37:12] determined to destroy the seat of christ
[1:37:15] and he does it by attacking us
[1:37:17] and we find david and the people that
[1:37:19] were with him lifted up their voice and
[1:37:20] they wept until they had no more power
[1:37:22] to weep and david's two wives that were
[1:37:24] taken
[1:37:25] and we know their names and david was
[1:37:27] greatly distressed for the people spake
[1:37:29] of stoning him because the soul of the
[1:37:31] people was grieved every man for his
[1:37:34] sons and for his daughters but david
[1:37:36] encouraged himself
[1:37:38] in the lord
[1:37:41] you know some of us we just gravitate to
[1:37:43] negativity i used to say negative nancy
[1:37:46] but i got corrected on that you're not
[1:37:48] supposed to say negative nancy you can
[1:37:50] say knock out nancy now
[1:37:53] knock out nancy knows who's i'm talking
[1:37:55] to
[1:37:56] because knockout nancy don't have a
[1:37:58] negative nancy attitude
[1:38:00] but if oh negative nancy was in this
[1:38:01] picture here david would have never
[1:38:03] encouraged himself in the lord but david
[1:38:05] began to think about what had god done
[1:38:08] for him david began to think about how
[1:38:10] good god is and all that god had done
[1:38:12] and how god delivered him from a line
[1:38:14] and how god delivered him from a bear
[1:38:16] and how god did all these great and
[1:38:18] mighty things and david began to
[1:38:19] encourage himself in the power and the
[1:38:21] providence of god in the promises of god
[1:38:23] that was his way he began to encourage
[1:38:26] himself in knowing that i've been
[1:38:27] elected by god i've been anointed by god
[1:38:30] i've been called by god i've been placed
[1:38:32] as a king by god he began to encourage
[1:38:34] himself of the previous battles of the
[1:38:36] previous victories what am i telling
[1:38:38] your church i'm telling you it's time
[1:38:40] that we begin to remember the things
[1:38:41] that you've done that god has brought us
[1:38:43] through you're not here today to feed it
[1:38:45] but you're here tonight more than an
[1:38:47] overcomer you're more than conquerors
[1:38:48] like you've been through one battle
[1:38:50] after another battle after another
[1:38:52] battle but you're still here you're
[1:38:54] still standing he turns yourself and
[1:38:56] what god has done for you
[1:39:00] no matter the odds no matter the
[1:39:02] opponent no matter the battle no matter
[1:39:03] the situation
[1:39:06] david encouraged himself
[1:39:10] and cursed himself in the lord
[1:39:14] and i think if there's ever a church
[1:39:16] that can encourage herself
[1:39:18] in the lord
[1:39:20] we've seen cancer defeated
[1:39:22] we've seen brain bleeds defeated
[1:39:25] we've seen alopecia defeated
[1:39:27] man we've seen prodigals come home
[1:39:30] come on prodigals raise your hands
[1:39:32] man we've seen prodigals come home
[1:39:35] cancer come on cancer cancer
[1:39:38] defeated oh depression defeated
[1:39:42] suicide defeated
[1:39:44] pornography defeated
[1:39:46] what am i telling you we got something
[1:39:48] to encourage ourselves about if god
[1:39:50] thought so much of you then a same god
[1:39:53] that thought of you did it's thinking of
[1:39:55] you now you can't lose tonight you're
[1:39:58] the victor
[1:39:59] i'm telling you you're the victor
[1:40:01] tonight encourage yourself and what god
[1:40:04] has done for you
[1:40:09] notice
[1:40:10] first samuel thirty and seven and david
[1:40:12] said to happen though the priest a
[1:40:13] himalayan son i pray thee bring me hear
[1:40:16] the ephod and abbathar brought
[1:40:18] through that ephod to david
[1:40:21] and david inquired at the lord saying
[1:40:24] shall i pursue after this troop
[1:40:26] shall overtake them
[1:40:29] and he answered
[1:40:30] no you probably should have stayed home
[1:40:32] on wednesday night and streamed that
[1:40:33] service
[1:40:36] brother joe's just a little bit too
[1:40:38] evangelistic for you
[1:40:40] you don't need to go
[1:40:42] no he said and he answered him
[1:40:45] pursue
[1:40:46] yeah
[1:40:48] no no no that was weak
[1:40:51] he answered him this is abbathar the
[1:40:54] priest god speaking to david in his
[1:40:56] darkest moment in his weakest moment in
[1:40:59] his most trying time and yet when he
[1:41:01] asked god god shall i pursue shall i
[1:41:03] overtake shall i recover all the voice
[1:41:06] of god thunderback pursue after the
[1:41:08] enemy you shall surely overtake the
[1:41:10] enemy and you shall surely recover all
[1:41:13] what am i telling you tonight i'll tell
[1:41:15] you that same god that anointed david is
[1:41:18] anointing you tonight don't you give up
[1:41:20] don't you back up you pursue tonight i'm

[1:41:31] tonight you shall overtake them and we
[1:41:33] shall recover we're not going to leave a
[1:41:35] hoof behind

[1:41:48] you wonder if everything is going to be
[1:41:50] all right will you ever change pursue
[1:41:54] you wonder will you be the great mighty
[1:41:55] warrior that you want to be pursue
[1:42:00] see the devils put questions in your
[1:42:01] mind

[1:42:07] am i just getting all caught up
[1:42:09] no the lord's answer
[1:42:10] and the lord's answer will always be
[1:42:12] pursue
[1:42:14] pursue
[1:42:16] pursue
[1:42:18] the same god
[1:42:19] is telling you to pursue
[1:42:21] you went last wednesday night on a
[1:42:24] message from brother aaron that said
[1:42:25] pursue
[1:42:27] overtake
[1:42:29] recover all
[1:42:31] bring home some spoils
[1:42:33] even like tabernacles need some spoils
[1:42:35] we need to see that god is good we want
[1:42:38] to taste it god is good we want to
[1:42:40] experience that god is good and when you
[1:42:42] young people went on that bus we didn't
[1:42:44] just send you off said oh praise god we
[1:42:46] get a break now no we went praying and
[1:42:49] we were with you we were in the midst of
[1:42:50] the battle somebody had to stay back
[1:42:52] with the stuff
[1:42:54] because they won't let all of us old
[1:42:56] people go to youth camps
[1:42:58] somebody's got to tarry with the stuff
[1:43:00] but what am i telling you the bible says
[1:43:02] that david chased after his enemy david
[1:43:04] went after him he said that that when
[1:43:06] they came back david the bible says in
[1:43:09] in first samuel 30 and 17 and david
[1:43:11] smote them from the twilight evening of
[1:43:14] the night into the next evening
[1:43:15] otherwise he got through on a thursday
[1:43:17] night and he began to fight and they
[1:43:19] fought all night thursday all day friday
[1:43:21] all night friday night all day saturday
[1:43:23] all day saturday night all day sunday he
[1:43:26] fought on the way home on the bus he
[1:43:27] fought off monday he fought on tuesday
[1:43:29] and he's here tonight and he's still
[1:43:31] fighting what am i telling david is
[1:43:33] fighting this enemy david ain't giving
[1:43:35] up david ain't backing down no david is
[1:43:37] pursuing
[1:43:39] david's cutting his enemy
[1:43:44] david smoked them
[1:43:46] and they're escaped not a man
[1:43:49] and david recovered all that the
[1:43:50] amalekites had carried away and david
[1:43:53] rescued his two wives and there was
[1:43:55] nothing lacking
[1:43:57] to them neither small nor great neither
[1:43:59] sons nor daughters neither spoiled nor
[1:44:01] anything that had taken from them david
[1:44:04] recovered oh
[1:44:08] see david knew
[1:44:10] what his god was capable of
[1:44:13] he saw the line
[1:44:15] he saw the bear
[1:44:16] he saw goliath
[1:44:18] he'd been in 66 battles
[1:44:20] david didn't know what it mean to lose
[1:44:24] come on david
[1:44:27] the same god that told david is the same
[1:44:29] god speaking to you tonight
[1:44:32] you've returned home from the battle
[1:44:34] notice what he does after the battle
[1:44:39] david came to the 200 men this is verse
[1:44:41] 21
[1:44:42] which were faint that they could not
[1:44:44] follow david
[1:44:45] whom they had made also to abide in the
[1:44:47] brook bazaar and they went forth to meet
[1:44:49] david and to meet the people that were
[1:44:51] with him and david came near to the
[1:44:53] people and he saluted them
[1:44:55] then answered all the wicked men the men
[1:44:57] of alau
[1:44:59] and those that went with david and they
[1:45:00] said because they were not they were not
[1:45:02] with us we will not give them out of the
[1:45:04] spoil that we have recovered save to
[1:45:06] every man his wife and his children that
[1:45:08] they may lead them away and depart i'm
[1:45:10] only going to let you have your family
[1:45:14] david said no
[1:45:15] that ain't how we fight
[1:45:17] that ain't how we fight you got this all
[1:45:19] wrong
[1:45:20] notice what david says then david said
[1:45:22] you shall not do so my brother with that
[1:45:24] which the lord had given us who hath
[1:45:26] preserved us and delivered the company
[1:45:28] that came against us into our hand for
[1:45:31] who will hearken unto you in this matter
[1:45:34] but as his part that goeth down to the
[1:45:36] battle so is his part that tarried with
[1:45:39] the stuff that they shall be part of
[1:45:41] life what am i telling even like

[1:51:03] is
[1:51:08] [Music]
[1:51:17] you can have your seats for a moment i
[1:51:18] think it's good that we can hear
[1:51:20] some of those falls
[1:51:22] feel these testimonies of what god has
[1:51:25] done and neither like tabernacle
[1:51:29] they told me i could tell the long
[1:51:31] version so get ready
[1:51:36] well
[1:51:36] back in march at oklahoma camp i went
[1:51:40] through the prayer line and i said that
[1:51:43] i wanted a refilling of the holy ghost
[1:51:46] and it was brother andrew and my dad
[1:51:48] praying for people up there and um
[1:51:51] brother andrew said
[1:51:52] well first of all you got it
[1:51:54] and i was like well yeah i know
[1:51:57] like i know when i got it i remember and
[1:51:59] everything but
[1:52:01] he was like no the devil's been lying to
[1:52:03] you
[1:52:04] like
[1:52:05] it's all over you
[1:52:07] and
[1:52:08] after that i realized that how much
[1:52:09] doubt i let
[1:52:11] like
[1:52:12] how much i lived with
[1:52:14] and um
[1:52:16] so after oklahoma camp i was able to
[1:52:19] live like i knew who i was
[1:52:21] and
[1:52:24] then at our youth camp
[1:52:26] i was back in the back running the
[1:52:28] projector on sunday morning
[1:52:30] and uh
[1:52:31] brother andrew got done preaching
[1:52:34] and everybody was singing
[1:52:36] and people were dancing and stuff and
[1:52:39] brother andrew looked all the way back
[1:52:41] at the back at me
[1:52:42] like to the back and he pointed he said
[1:52:44] you got it you got it
[1:52:47] and that was just so special that god
[1:52:49] reminded me that i
[1:52:51] had it you know and
[1:52:54] so
[1:52:55] we'll skip ahead to august now and
[1:52:58] wednesday night was like just what i
[1:53:01] needed before camp because
[1:53:03] um
[1:53:04] like i could go into camp with the
[1:53:06] mentality that i'm an overcomer
[1:53:09] and i need more of god like the devil
[1:53:11] had always made me feel guilty for
[1:53:13] needing more of god like if you need
[1:53:14] more like you must not be good enough
[1:53:16] you know but
[1:53:19] it's just the trend of laodicea like
[1:53:21] they have need of nothing and so if you
[1:53:22] go against that trend then he'll make
[1:53:24] you feel guilty but
[1:53:28] so i had this list that
[1:53:31] i had made for ohio camp and
[1:53:34] i wanted a really personal experience
[1:53:37] with god i wanted to be so full of god
[1:53:40] that it was just flowing through me and
[1:53:42] around me
[1:53:43] and
[1:53:44] like i just wanted something really
[1:53:46] personal
[1:53:47] and
[1:53:49] i wanted a refilling because i'm not
[1:53:52] satisfied and um
[1:53:54] so
[1:53:56] um thursday night
[1:53:58] rolls around and this spontaneous prayer
[1:54:01] line formed
[1:54:02] and
[1:54:03] i was like no i'm not gonna go
[1:54:06] it's okay but
[1:54:09] then brother nathan erickson i think he
[1:54:11] had been down praying with people but he
[1:54:13] went back on the platform
[1:54:15] and he was like
[1:54:17] young people if you feel the pull of god
[1:54:19] to go through this prayer line then come
[1:54:22] and a few times they had mentioned that
[1:54:24] night about charlie and rachel and
[1:54:27] how time is so fleeting like you're not
[1:54:29] promised tomorrow
[1:54:31] and
[1:54:32] it just really hit me like even at camp
[1:54:34] like i'm not promised tomorrow
[1:54:36] and i was like if i can picture like
[1:54:39] my life ending
[1:54:41] tonight like not living another day
[1:54:43] after this
[1:54:44] then i'd want it tonight
[1:54:46] and so
[1:54:47] finally i went and got in line and
[1:54:51] i was really nervous
[1:54:52] and
[1:54:54] then i was like hold up
[1:54:56] that's the devil playing with my
[1:54:57] emotions
[1:54:59] because god would never want me to be
[1:55:00] nervous
[1:55:01] he would want me to have peace and he
[1:55:03] would always want me to come to him
[1:55:06] and so
[1:55:07] i finally got up there
[1:55:10] and
[1:55:11] i ended up in front of brother andrew
[1:55:13] and brother aaron
[1:55:15] and i told them i was like i just want
[1:55:17] to know that i've given absolutely
[1:55:19] everything like i'm not holding anything
[1:55:21] back
[1:55:22] i don't want to be caught lacking only
[1:55:24] given 80 or 99 i want to give him
[1:55:27] absolutely everything and i want to be
[1:55:30] like i want to be saturated with god
[1:55:33] and um
[1:55:35] so they started praying for me
[1:55:37] and uh brother aaron prayed even that no
[1:55:41] fear complexes or anything would hinder
[1:55:44] my worship and
[1:55:47] he raised my arm in the air and he said
[1:55:49] this is the message this is the holy
[1:55:51] ghost
[1:55:52] and that was just like
[1:55:54] so meant so much to me
[1:55:56] and um
[1:55:58] then
[1:55:58] i switched back and i heard brother
[1:56:01] andrew and he had quit praying and he
[1:56:04] said
[1:56:05] and my eyes were still closed my hands
[1:56:07] were in the air but
[1:56:08] he said
[1:56:10] it's different this time and you know it
[1:56:12] he said you testify
[1:56:16] and i said
[1:56:17] he's mine and the devil can't take him
[1:56:19] away and my arms were straight up in the
[1:56:21] air just waving in the air and
[1:56:24] after that i felt like i was like three
[1:56:26] feet from my body watching myself praise
[1:56:29] god
[1:56:32] i was saying other stuff i have no idea
[1:56:34] i don't know what but
[1:56:36] um
[1:56:39] and
[1:56:40] brother andrew i could still like hear
[1:56:42] certain stuff and brother andrew said
[1:56:45] man that's powerful
[1:56:47] and then
[1:56:48] he said he told brother aaron he's like
[1:56:50] hurry let's pray for the next one while
[1:56:52] that anointing is still right here and
[1:56:54] so
[1:56:55] they
[1:56:56] led me away all the way
[1:56:58] to the right of the platform
[1:57:01] and
[1:57:04] my foot was against the platform
[1:57:07] and i could hear colby singing really
[1:57:09] close but
[1:57:11] that's the only way i knew i was in that
[1:57:13] building because i was not there
[1:57:16] i was just
[1:57:17] so caught up praising god
[1:57:20] and everything was so clear that it was
[1:57:23] only god's grace that it was all god's
[1:57:26] grace that had done a work in my life
[1:57:28] and the devil was just so tiny like he
[1:57:31] tries to blow himself up but he's not
[1:57:32] that big
[1:57:34] but
[1:57:35] uh
[1:57:38] [Music]
[1:57:39] [Applause]
[1:57:43] but
[1:57:44] about 10 or 15 feet in front of me i
[1:57:46] could see the throne of god
[1:57:48] and he was sitting there in white robes
[1:57:51] and it's like my head was bowed and i
[1:57:54] could only see him out of my peripheral
[1:57:55] vision
[1:57:56] and i couldn't see above his waist
[1:57:59] but
[1:58:00] i was just praising god and there was a
[1:58:02] mass of voices behind me just praising
[1:58:04] god like heaven
[1:58:06] and
[1:58:07] out of the whole crowd
[1:58:09] i could rebecca's voice was distinct
[1:58:13] and
[1:58:15] before
[1:58:16] camp i'd really been praying for her
[1:58:18] that you know she would know she had the
[1:58:20] holy ghost and that she would surrender
[1:58:22] her gifts to god because she's so
[1:58:24] talented she's
[1:58:26] really anointed and
[1:58:28] in that moment i realized
[1:58:30] i'm gonna hear her voice in heaven
[1:58:33] and she's gonna shake the kingdom of
[1:58:35] hell while she's on this earth
[1:58:37] and she's gonna i'm gonna hear her
[1:58:39] praising god in heaven
[1:58:41] and um
[1:58:44] always when i had imagined heaven
[1:58:47] i would always just picture
[1:58:49] god and then me worshiping god and just
[1:58:52] this faceless crowd but it's not it was
[1:58:55] all the faces that i loved
[1:58:58] the people that we know
[1:59:00] people here it's going to be there
[1:59:03] and we all get to praise them they're
[1:59:05] together
[1:59:06] and
[1:59:08] so that
[1:59:10] it was just like the most amazing
[1:59:11] experience my entire life and
[1:59:15] i just held it in my heart and i didn't
[1:59:18] really have the words to tell anybody
[1:59:20] until friday night after church when i
[1:59:22] told the girls in my dorm
[1:59:24] and
[1:59:26] i was just
[1:59:27] i was telling them about it and i was
[1:59:28] just crying
[1:59:30] and crying and i was like god you're
[1:59:33] going to have to be my strength because
[1:59:35] i want to be back there i don't want to
[1:59:37] be here i was like
[1:59:40] you're going to have to be my strength
[1:59:41] to live on this earth because i feel so
[1:59:43] weak
[1:59:45] and
[1:59:48] me and lily were just crying and she was
[1:59:51] praying with me
[1:59:53] and
[1:59:54] i couldn't fall asleep that night
[1:59:56] and
[1:59:57] i ended up only getting four hours of
[1:59:59] sleep but um i turned on the lifeline
[2:00:03] app
[2:00:04] and
[2:00:05] brother brandon was preaching the
[2:00:06] commission
[2:00:07] and he started talking about heaven like
[2:00:10] almost right when i turned it on
[2:00:12] and i heard and i got on the table app
[2:00:14] and i was like i gotta find that and so
[2:00:16] i found it
[2:00:18] and i'll tell you what he said he said
[2:00:22] now just think after the battle is all
[2:00:24] over and the smokes died down we come up
[2:00:27] meet our loved ones and then meet him we
[2:00:29] sat down at the table across from each
[2:00:31] other won't that be wonderful there will
[2:00:33] never be a crutch or a wheelchair around
[2:00:35] the table oh won't that be marvelous
[2:00:38] and then when we see all that setting
[2:00:40] along there i look across the table and
[2:00:43] i say well god bless you brother my
[2:00:46] and then we'll just have to cry a little
[2:00:48] bit don't you believe so if we can we'll
[2:00:50] just cry a little bit for joy
[2:00:53] and then at the head of the table will
[2:00:54] come out our king and his majesty he'll
[2:00:57] walk down along all of us and put his
[2:00:59] arms around us and say you suffered much
[2:01:02] you went through much for me
[2:01:03] he wipes away all the tears from our
[2:01:06] eyes now don't cry anymore it's all over
[2:01:09] oh for that great time that's why we're
[2:01:11] here isn't it i want to be wonderful to
[2:01:13] feel his arm around you and say now
[2:01:15] don't cry enter into the joys of the
[2:01:17] lord you've fought a good fight so while
[2:01:20] we're here and got this opportunity
[2:01:22] let's make it a good fight a real fight
[2:01:26] and after that
[2:01:28] i was
[2:01:29] i felt like i was getting my strengths
[2:01:31] back to go on
[2:01:33] but
[2:01:34] sunday morning brother timothy read his
[2:01:37] opening scriptures and then he read the
[2:01:39] exact quote
[2:01:43] i asked him about it later and he said
[2:01:45] it was already in his notes but
[2:01:47] and he preached that morning on let's
[2:01:50] make it a good fight he could have just
[2:01:52] titled it this is for lauren adams but
[2:01:54] it's okay
[2:01:56] but
[2:01:57] if you haven't heard it you should
[2:01:58] totally go listen to it um because it
[2:02:01] was amazing
[2:02:03] but
[2:02:04] you know usually at camp you're really
[2:02:06] sad to come home because it's like
[2:02:08] amazing
[2:02:09] but after this and i was like no
[2:02:12] it's it's really not sad to come home i
[2:02:14] was like it doesn't matter if i'm at
[2:02:16] camp
[2:02:17] if i'm at home because i'm fighting to
[2:02:19] get back there
[2:02:22] [Music]
[2:02:31] not just for the adams family
[2:02:33] but for even the light family
[2:02:35] for the bride of jesus christ
[2:02:38] that's why we fight
[2:02:41] tonight
[2:02:43] i had a couple of select people to come
[2:02:45] up if we don't get to all of you tonight
[2:02:48] what i'm gonna ask you to do is to uh
[2:02:50] maybe video your testimony and let us
[2:02:52] put it on the facebook page so we can
[2:02:54] keep it as a memorial of what god has
[2:02:56] done
[2:02:57] so please do that some of you have wrote
[2:02:59] it down but let's video it and keep it
[2:03:01] so it triggers back up a year from now
[2:03:03] the devil's still under your feet
[2:03:07] i might have to read this because i know
[2:03:09] it's going to be all over the place if i
[2:03:10] don't
[2:03:12] so going into camp i didn't know what i
[2:03:14] really wanted but i knew i wanted him to
[2:03:16] speak to me personally
[2:03:19] i started i start i'll start by saying i
[2:03:21] don't get offended by any of the jokes
[2:03:23] between us and our friends
[2:03:34] but being the only
[2:03:37] thank you
[2:03:47] [Applause]
[2:03:51] it's my baby here
[2:03:54] mama's staying with you too but being
[2:03:56] the only black kid in church was kind of
[2:03:58] overwhelming and sometimes i felt out of
[2:04:00] place
[2:04:01] i kept it to myself because i thought if
[2:04:03] i did then it would all just go away
[2:04:07] the devil attacked me a lot about it and
[2:04:10] i just never told anyone just kept it to
[2:04:12] myself
[2:04:13] well saturday night i went through the
[2:04:15] prayer line knowing that i would go in
[2:04:17] one way and come out completely
[2:04:19] different
[2:04:20] and sure enough i got that and so much
[2:04:23] more i made it to uncle timothy and he
[2:04:25] said
[2:04:26] you belong here
[2:04:28] and at that moment i just broke down
[2:04:31] fell to the floor just bawling my eyes
[2:04:33] out
[2:04:34] satan had attacked me long enough with
[2:04:36] you'll never fit in or you'll never be
[2:04:38] like them i mean look at you you're
[2:04:40] black in a church full of white people
[2:04:42] i was helped by two sisters to a bench
[2:04:45] where i would just cry and thank god for
[2:04:47] the longest time
[2:04:48] i don't know i stayed there for at least
[2:04:51] a good 30 minutes
[2:04:53] and then i finally got up and there was
[2:04:55] this
[2:04:56] random sister that was there
[2:04:59] and she
[2:05:00] gave me the biggest hug in the world and
[2:05:03] said he's so work he's so real and to
[2:05:06] myself i was like lady you just don't
[2:05:08] even know like i know for real
[2:05:11] until
[2:05:12] af i had finished thought i finished
[2:05:15] crying
[2:05:16] when that happened and then i bawled my
[2:05:19] eyes out on this random lady's shoulder
[2:05:21] and then
[2:05:23] so after that i
[2:05:25] got myself together at least thought i
[2:05:27] did and then katie comes and i was like
[2:05:29] well the floodgates are open again
[2:05:32] and i started crying all over again and
[2:05:35] i had to get myself together because i
[2:05:37] wanted to
[2:05:38] be back to my
[2:05:40] bike
[2:05:41] back
[2:05:42] into myself so i could experience
[2:05:45] everybody else getting blessed in the
[2:05:46] service
[2:05:49] [Music]

[2:07:01] time it's all right let's still only 9
[2:07:02] o'clock man y'all staying up late on
[2:07:04] this watching football or something
[2:07:06] netflix hulu one of them things
[2:07:10] chelan
[2:07:17] these are hand-picked on purpose
[2:07:21] and if i didn't pick you it's not on
[2:07:22] purpose
[2:07:24] it's just these are special that i think
[2:07:26] the world needs to hear about these
[2:07:32] okay so
[2:07:34] i've had touches from god and i've been
[2:07:36] delivered from stuff in the past but
[2:07:39] i've never had anything that i could
[2:07:41] look back on
[2:07:42] and say that i got the holy ghost until
[2:07:45] friday night
[2:07:47] so for around the past year i've been
[2:07:51] basically completely spiritually dead
[2:07:55] and i knew i didn't have the holy ghost
[2:07:57] and i honestly didn't want to give god
[2:07:59] everything
[2:08:01] and i didn't want to give
[2:08:03] up the stuff that i was doing in my life
[2:08:05] that
[2:08:06] i knew a holy ghost person wouldn't do
[2:08:09] or say and so basically i just kept
[2:08:12] walking away from god and god would
[2:08:15] speak to me but i never answered him
[2:08:20] i just turned away and the past few
[2:08:22] months for me had been really difficult
[2:08:25] i felt super miserable to the point
[2:08:27] where i didn't want to do anything and i
[2:08:29] would just feel so
[2:08:32] emotionally and physically drained from
[2:08:34] talking to people because i was just
[2:08:36] pretending
[2:08:39] and just before ohio camp i was so done
[2:08:42] with sin and being depressed that i was
[2:08:45] just like i can't live like this anymore
[2:08:47] something's gonna change and
[2:08:49] i wanted god to change me completely
[2:08:51] because i knew i couldn't do it without
[2:08:53] him
[2:08:55] so thursday was a really great service
[2:08:57] and i enjoyed it but i was kind of
[2:08:59] feeling down because i didn't really
[2:09:00] feel god
[2:09:02] talking directly to me
[2:09:04] and then friday comes and i'm like
[2:09:06] really tired and i'm like i don't think
[2:09:07] i'm really gonna get anything out of the
[2:09:09] service
[2:09:10] but brother timothy starts preaching and
[2:09:12] literally every word of that sermon
[2:09:16] was directly for me
[2:09:21] and i just felt god come down and i
[2:09:24] couldn't wait to get to the altar and
[2:09:26] just give him everything
[2:09:29] and i'm just standing there crying
[2:09:32] and brother wayne comes down
[2:09:35] and
[2:09:37] he says i felt the spirit of god tell me
[2:09:39] to come pray for you and he starts
[2:09:40] praying and i'm just bawling and i start
[2:09:44] giving everything to god and the
[2:09:46] ministers leave and i'm still praying
[2:09:47] i'm just standing there just
[2:09:49] literally
[2:09:51] everything just
[2:09:53] i didn't want anything and the devil
[2:09:56] tried to come and he's like
[2:09:59] if you if you give up this you're gonna
[2:10:01] go have to apologize to some people
[2:10:02] you're gonna go have to apologize to
[2:10:04] parents are you willing to do that and
[2:10:06] i'm like i just i just can't live like
[2:10:07] this anymore i have to i can't i just
[2:10:10] can't
[2:10:11] and
[2:10:12] i as i was praying i just felt the most
[2:10:15] beautiful presence i've literally ever
[2:10:17] felt in my life flow over me i collapse
[2:10:20] and i'm just laying there and i did not
[2:10:22] want to move i'm just like
[2:10:25] laying on the ground and i'd kind of
[2:10:27] wondered before how like mariah did it
[2:10:29] because me usually when i'm praying at
[2:10:31] the altar i'm just like i'm thinking
[2:10:34] about other things sometimes and i'm
[2:10:36] thinking about how my knees are or my
[2:10:38] fear
[2:10:39] or if if people can see the snot running
[2:10:42] down my
[2:10:43] face but
[2:10:45] i was literally just
[2:10:47] i was i was just thinking about god and
[2:10:49] i was thanking him for what he'd done
[2:10:51] for me and they started playing playing
[2:10:54] the song i hear my chains falling and i
[2:10:57] literally felt something propel me off
[2:11:00] the ground and i screamed
[2:11:03] my chains are on the ground
[2:11:05] and
[2:11:07] i i just sat there worshiping god and
[2:11:10] thanking him and telling him i love him
[2:11:11] because i'm free and i have the holy
[2:11:14] ghost and nothing can ever take that
[2:11:15] away from me
[2:11:16] [Applause]
[2:11:21] amen
[2:11:24] since marie you needed that
[2:11:27] your family's been through a battle
[2:11:29] but you got a spoil you got victory
[2:11:30] right here you got victory right here
[2:11:34] you got victory right here we got
[2:11:36] something we point the devil back to
[2:11:39] he lost the soul that he thought he had
[2:11:42] the chains have fallen off and we're
[2:11:44] free at last oh church a living god
[2:11:47] look what god has done for even like
[2:11:49] tabernacles
[2:11:53] we got a couple more we're going to do
[2:11:58] amen i'm so thankful for us being
[2:12:01] allowed to go to ohio camp and all the
[2:12:03] testimonies that have come from it it's
[2:12:05] just been a real blessing
[2:12:07] but
[2:12:08] for the past two years i've been seeking
[2:12:10] the holy ghost and
[2:12:12] after every camp or special meeting i'm
[2:12:15] like lord i want the holy ghost i want
[2:12:17] you to feel me just completely fill me
[2:12:19] but
[2:12:20] after every camper meeting
[2:12:22] that i didn't get it i'd come home real
[2:12:25] down because i'm like well i didn't get
[2:12:27] it this time
[2:12:28] and i was like when am i even gonna get
[2:12:31] it at the next time why go why should i
[2:12:33] try why go to the altar he didn't answer
[2:12:35] me last time i went why would he answer
[2:12:38] me this time but that was just eliza the
[2:12:40] devil speaking to me
[2:12:43] but it's been a real battle
[2:12:45] and
[2:12:46] this year at oklahoma camp
[2:12:49] i was went there asking and seeking for
[2:12:51] the holy ghost
[2:12:52] and the lord touched me he gave me a
[2:12:54] touch of the holy ghost and he did it
[2:12:56] last year at ohio camp too
[2:12:58] but i didn't allow him to completely
[2:13:01] fill me i just lord i said lord you can
[2:13:04] have this but you can't have all of me
[2:13:07] but
[2:13:08] this year at ohio camp brother andrew
[2:13:10] spencer preached about repentance and
[2:13:12] complete full repentance
[2:13:14] and so that night in the prayer line i
[2:13:17] was
[2:13:18] well actually while i was preaching i
[2:13:20] said prayer i said lord
[2:13:22] everything i am i give it to you
[2:13:25] all my dreams all my thoughts all my
[2:13:27] plans god my whole life i gave it to him
[2:13:30] that night
[2:13:31] and so i went down into the prayer line
[2:13:34] thursday
[2:13:36] night and
[2:13:37] i went up to brother wayne and brother
[2:13:40] timothy and i said i want the holy ghost
[2:13:42] i said i've gotten touches before but i
[2:13:44] want it to completely fill me and that i
[2:13:48] just know that i have it well brother
[2:13:50] wayne said you're in the right place
[2:13:52] he said he's already done it for
[2:13:55] youth tonight he can do it again and
[2:13:58] he said all you have to do is open up
[2:14:00] your heart so right then i lifted up
[2:14:03] both my hands and i started praying i
[2:14:04] said lord i've given you my all i pray
[2:14:07] that you'll just come fill me and
[2:14:09] brother wayne said that's it and he just
[2:14:11] started praying for me
[2:14:13] then after he prayed for me he said
[2:14:15] joseph
[2:14:16] it's happening
[2:14:18] he said he's filling you
[2:14:20] and he said i want you to remember this
[2:14:22] song i want you to remember this date i
[2:14:24] want you to remember this sermon because
[2:14:27] this is where it happened
[2:14:29] and brother andrew preached on
[2:14:31] stirred by remembrance the song they
[2:14:33] were singing was nothing but the blood
[2:14:36] and
[2:14:37] i forgot the date but i have it written
[2:14:39] down
[2:14:40] in my notebook but
[2:14:42] i just stood at the altar and i was
[2:14:44] praising the lord for it and
[2:14:46] after that night i was really changed i
[2:14:49] just got to enjoy camp not worry about
[2:14:51] anything just have a good time and enjoy
[2:14:53] the presence of the lord
[2:14:55] and sunday morning brother timothy
[2:14:58] preached on let's make it a good fight
[2:14:59] and at the end it was very powerful and
[2:15:03] during the end
[2:15:05] song service
[2:15:06] they were singing you don't know like i
[2:15:08] know
[2:15:09] well
[2:15:10] i was so done with the devil
[2:15:12] attacking me and
[2:15:15] i knew i got the holy ghost and i know i
[2:15:17] was changed but i just wanted to rub it
[2:15:20] in a little bit
[2:15:21] so i took my shoes off in church which
[2:15:24] is something guys shouldn't do just
[2:15:26] saying
[2:15:27] usually keep them on
[2:15:28] but i took them off and i wrote the
[2:15:30] devil's name on the bottom of my shoe
[2:15:33] and while i was doing that brother
[2:15:35] andrew spencer said i get joy when i
[2:15:37] think about satan under my feet
[2:15:39] well after that i put my shoes back on
[2:15:41] and i started praising the lord and
[2:15:43] dancing and shouting
[2:15:45] and just having a good time in his
[2:15:47] presence praising the lord
[2:15:49] well after that service i looked at the
[2:15:51] bottom of my shoes and the devil's name
[2:15:53] was gone
[2:15:54] and that just proved to me that he's no
[2:15:56] longer around me he doesn't have a hold
[2:15:58] on me any longer
[2:16:06] and you wonder why we shout
[2:16:08] and you wonder why we praise god
[2:16:10] or what if that was your young boy who's
[2:16:13] been in a battle who've been in a
[2:16:14] struggle now he's got the victory i got
[2:16:16] a reason to shout i got a reason to
[2:16:19] rejoice oh we got a reason tonight even
[2:16:22] like tabernacle our young people went to
[2:16:24] battle but they come home packing a
[2:16:26] victory hey come home bring it small
[2:16:30] and now they're sharing we got one more
[2:16:32] tonight sister manny
[2:16:34] oh my don't try to shut me up
[2:16:37] my son got the holy ghost lauren's
[2:16:39] before the throne of god hearing my
[2:16:40] daughter rebekah sing
[2:16:42] i hope i'm in there somewhere
[2:16:45] please lord
[2:16:48] okay so
[2:16:49] it's kind of a mess but i kind of wrote
[2:16:52] it last minute um so like joseph was
[2:16:54] saying i've been seeking the holy ghost
[2:16:56] for some time now i fought from camp to
[2:16:58] camp and nothing ever supernatural
[2:17:00] happened to me i thought i had it every
[2:17:02] time something happened i danced i
[2:17:04] shouted and i just felt refreshed after
[2:17:06] it wasn't and the devil was saying oh
[2:17:09] you danced so you must have it but i'll
[2:17:11] fall right back in the same traps as
[2:17:13] before
[2:17:14] here recently i've just been wanting the
[2:17:17] holy ghost
[2:17:18] so bad like i've never
[2:17:20] wanted something so bad in my life
[2:17:23] so
[2:17:26] i had a desire like it was
[2:17:29] i don't know i can't explain it it was
[2:17:30] just like i had to have him like i can't
[2:17:32] live this life
[2:17:34] without him
[2:17:35] so
[2:17:36] this youth camp i had told myself i'm
[2:17:38] gonna get it i had to get it i can't
[2:17:39] walk away without it
[2:17:41] i i don't want to live without them
[2:17:43] um so i made a list expectations and all
[2:17:47] that stuff
[2:17:48] and
[2:17:49] um
[2:17:51] i had all these scenarios in my head of
[2:17:52] how it would go like thursday night oh
[2:17:54] yeah it'd be great probably be great
[2:17:57] saturday i might get it i don't know i
[2:17:59] might get it sunday it's gonna be
[2:18:01] rejoicing time it'd be great
[2:18:03] well none of that happened
[2:18:05] and so
[2:18:07] i got really discouraged because like i
[2:18:09] felt nothing i felt emotionless
[2:18:12] i had no hope i felt like a failure
[2:18:15] and
[2:18:15] so i actually reached out to brother joe
[2:18:18] on saturday morning
[2:18:20] because i didn't know what else to do
[2:18:22] like i've went through prayer lines i
[2:18:24] went through
[2:18:25] both i went every single night almost
[2:18:27] and i was like lord why can't i get it
[2:18:30] why is it not for me am i not worthy
[2:18:32] enough am i not loved enough
[2:18:35] so
[2:18:35] brother joe
[2:18:38] um
[2:18:39] had sent me a message back he said
[2:18:41] repent and be baptized and you shall
[2:18:43] receive it it's mine
[2:18:44] just claim it i told him that i was
[2:18:46] scared
[2:18:47] that i was gonna go to hell and wouldn't
[2:18:49] make into the rapture
[2:18:51] he
[2:18:52] went on and
[2:18:54] at the end he
[2:18:56] actually prophesied over me he's i'm
[2:18:58] just going to read it for y'all so he
[2:18:59] said god loves you god sees you god has
[2:19:02] heard your hearts cry and let me
[2:19:04] prophesy
[2:19:05] that you will get what you are seeking
[2:19:07] you receive the indwelling of the holy
[2:19:09] ghost you will have joy you will walk in
[2:19:11] victory and you put your foot on the
[2:19:13] head of that thing that's been
[2:19:14] tormenting you and you will be changed
[2:19:17] so
[2:19:18] i went through the prayer line saturday
[2:19:20] night
[2:19:21] no minister said anything
[2:19:24] that stuck out they said nothing so i
[2:19:26] felt
[2:19:28] like why am i here like
[2:19:31] why did god put me on this place and i
[2:19:34] got nothing
[2:19:36] so
[2:19:37] um
[2:19:39] every night everyone would like come and
[2:19:41] tell their testimonies in the dorm
[2:19:43] of
[2:19:44] like what had happened or what they
[2:19:45] experienced like i was happy for them
[2:19:48] but i wasn't happy if that makes sense
[2:19:51] um
[2:19:53] so
[2:19:54] after i text brother joe he'd answered
[2:19:56] um
[2:19:57] rebecca paris actually
[2:20:00] saturday morning i had like let her read
[2:20:03] where brother joe sent because
[2:20:05] i don't know i was like i didn't really
[2:20:06] i cared what he said but like
[2:20:10] i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry
[2:20:13] this is just the devil it's just the
[2:20:15] devil
[2:20:17] i don't care i don't care i promise i
[2:20:19] care
[2:20:20] um
[2:20:21] so anyway
[2:20:23] rebecca paris
[2:20:26] listened and we had a good talk it was a
[2:20:28] really good talk and i'm glad that god
[2:20:30] had put her
[2:20:32] in that moment so she could help me and
[2:20:34] stuff and so
[2:20:37] um
[2:20:38] that night i believe it was saturday
[2:20:40] night after the prayer line
[2:20:42] i had went to my room just reading my
[2:20:44] bible and
[2:20:45] praying like lord
[2:20:47] please like i can't i can't carry on
[2:20:50] so um
[2:20:52] the girls got back in their dorm
[2:20:54] and
[2:20:55] um
[2:20:57] tori was actually saying it's not
[2:20:58] something you have to work up it's a
[2:21:00] gift you just have to take the gift
[2:21:03] i thought that
[2:21:06] hold on lost my spot
[2:21:08] add thought
[2:21:10] okay i had a thought oh wait there's
[2:21:11] still one more service like don't
[2:21:14] don't give up hope there's one more
[2:21:15] service
[2:21:16] so sunday rolled around i prayed for a
[2:21:18] piece
[2:21:20] that i would leave there
[2:21:21] that
[2:21:23] like even though it wasn't coming that i
[2:21:25] had a piece like i know it was coming
[2:21:27] and so
[2:21:28] um
[2:21:31] i left with the piece the service all
[2:21:33] the services were great
[2:21:35] um the piece i just had like a piece
[2:21:37] like lord even though it's not my time
[2:21:39] like i know it's coming you promise it
[2:21:41] to me
[2:21:42] so
[2:21:43] um we had got back on the bus we kind of
[2:21:45] just chilled and hung out for a while
[2:21:48] well everything
[2:21:49] started settling down
[2:21:51] people started giving their testimonies
[2:21:54] and so
[2:21:55] i was i text rebecca paris again
[2:21:58] and i told her that i felt bad for not
[2:22:00] having a testimony
[2:22:01] it's like lord everyone is testifying on
[2:22:04] what you've done this weekend and i have
[2:22:05] nothing to testify of i have nothing and
[2:22:08] so
[2:22:09] um she told me
[2:22:11] that just talk to brother aaron
[2:22:13] of all the seats that could have been
[2:22:14] opened it was a seat right beside me
[2:22:18] so i had a hope
[2:22:20] like just because we're on the bus like
[2:22:21] there's
[2:22:22] you can he can meet you anytime anyplace
[2:22:24] anywhere you don't have to be on the
[2:22:26] campground you don't have to be in a
[2:22:28] special meeting you don't have to be in
[2:22:29] a church service he can meet you
[2:22:31] anywhere
[2:22:32] and so
[2:22:33] um
[2:22:36] like i said i'm a very planned and
[2:22:37] organized person and so i had all of
[2:22:40] these scenarios of how it would go
[2:22:43] well it didn't go that way
[2:22:45] so
[2:22:47] um
[2:22:49] the scenario that i made up was rebecca
[2:22:50] adams was supposed to come and sing and
[2:22:52] i was going to talk to him brother aaron
[2:22:54] while he was while she was singing
[2:22:56] well didn't work out that way
[2:22:58] um brother aaron gave a speech after
[2:23:01] someone had finished their testimony
[2:23:03] and literally said all the things that i
[2:23:05] was thinking he said you know just
[2:23:07] because we left the campgrounds doesn't
[2:23:09] mean we can't create an atmosphere right
[2:23:10] here it's not too late it's never too
[2:23:13] late
[2:23:14] the president can drop right here on
[2:23:16] this bus and we can get and you can get
[2:23:18] what you have been asking for
[2:23:20] just because you didn't get it at camp
[2:23:22] doesn't mean you can't get it now
[2:23:24] i know you've been on your phone while
[2:23:25] the testimonies have been going on which
[2:23:27] is okay i knew right then
[2:23:30] he was talking to me because i was
[2:23:31] texting everyone in our group chat
[2:23:34] [Music]
[2:23:36] that we had
[2:23:38] yes we have a group chat i'm sorry we
[2:23:39] have a group chat
[2:23:41] um
[2:23:45] anyway they
[2:23:47] um i was just telling them like hey
[2:23:50] y'all pray for me because i kind of want
[2:23:53] to talk to brother aaron and i'm kind of
[2:23:55] scared dr brother aaron
[2:23:57] and sorry that i was scared to talk to
[2:23:59] you brother aaron
[2:24:01] um
[2:24:02] he
[2:24:04] lost my place again anyway he was
[2:24:07] i was texting back to the group chat
[2:24:10] um
[2:24:11] i was like y'all pray for me i'm scared
[2:24:13] to talk to him like i don't want to
[2:24:14] leave this bus i don't want to go home
[2:24:16] the same way that i came
[2:24:18] and so
[2:24:19] he
[2:24:22] was um
[2:24:24] giving his little speech i don't
[2:24:25] remember all that he was saying because
[2:24:27] i was kind of crying because he was
[2:24:29] literally saying everything that i was
[2:24:31] thinking
[2:24:32] and
[2:24:33] he had finished his speech
[2:24:35] and he started praying for me and asked
[2:24:38] ask me do you think you aren't worthy
[2:24:40] enough to have it do you think you can't
[2:24:42] receive it because you think he will
[2:24:44] leave you
[2:24:45] which it never really crossed my mind
[2:24:46] when he said that it was spot on though
[2:24:49] my mom had left me
[2:24:50] when i was younger and i guess i was
[2:24:52] scared he would leave me too
[2:24:54] i don't remember a lot of what he said i
[2:24:57] just began confessing and testifying i
[2:24:59] wasn't going to be like my mom and that
[2:25:01] i was going to get the holy ghost i am
[2:25:03] worthy enough he loved me so much that
[2:25:05] he died and took all my sins away i had
[2:25:08] to surrender everything and i was ready
[2:25:10] to surrender everything
[2:25:12] i had to get to a point of you know it's
[2:25:14] either this world or it's him i just
[2:25:16] wanted him and that's all
[2:25:18] nothing else in this world matters
[2:25:20] of all the places that could have
[2:25:22] happened it happened on the bus don't
[2:25:24] you tell me god can't do it he can do it
[2:25:26] anytime any place anywhere
[2:25:34] that's right
[2:25:38] and the devil can't tell me it didn't
[2:25:39] happen either because i had 50 or more
[2:25:41] witnesses right beside me fighting this
[2:25:43] battle along with me this isn't like
[2:25:45] last time i thought i had it before but
[2:25:47] i got the real deal i have never been so
[2:25:50] happy
[2:25:51] let's make this last little bit a good
[2:25:53] fight we got this it isn't going to be
[2:25:55] easy but we are on the winning side we
[2:25:57] can't lose don't ever lose hope he

[2:27:06] spoils returning from the battle
[2:27:09] we got one more
[2:27:10] that i think
[2:27:12] is going to be a very big encouragement
[2:27:14] to the church
[2:27:15] and his brother aaron
[2:27:17] from there and took a burden to preach
[2:27:19] last wednesday get on the bus
[2:27:22] with all these crazy teenagers
[2:27:25] get no sleep
[2:27:27] and we all know that brother aaron's had
[2:27:29] some health issues
[2:27:30] not in his mind
[2:27:33] but he's had some health issues and that
[2:27:35] was a big undertaking
[2:27:37] that was not a
[2:27:38] simple little thing for him to do i mean
[2:27:40] come on he's not five foot six
[2:27:44] he's
[2:27:45] he had bus seats
[2:27:47] they're small so he had to figure out
[2:27:48] how to do that
[2:27:52] how big are they
[2:27:53] okay bus seats all
[2:27:55] i don't ride a bus
[2:27:57] i fly not first class but i fly coach
[2:28:01] next year there you go
[2:28:03] so this was a big undertaking and i want
[2:28:06] to say brother aaron thank you for
[2:28:07] taking the burden to take our young
[2:28:09] people and wave that banner and take the
[2:28:11] colors up there and declare that even
[2:28:13] like standing with you
[2:28:15] we're standing with you
[2:28:17] we didn't send you along
[2:28:22] and god laid it upon his heart to go
[2:28:24] with you and and the lord done something
[2:28:26] very special for brother aaron brother
[2:28:27] and if you've come at this time and give
[2:28:29] your testimony
[2:28:32] um i i do want to take the opportunity
[2:28:34] to also uh thank brother matthew and
[2:28:37] sister elizabeth they did an incredible
[2:28:39] job it was awesome to have them with us
[2:28:42] and so if we give them a round of
[2:28:43] applause as well
[2:28:53] you know i got an
[2:28:55] awesome text from maddie i just want to
[2:28:56] add this she wrote me and said uh
[2:28:59] i know that sister lydia told you i was
[2:29:01] scared of you
[2:29:03] but i'm not scared of you anymore
[2:29:06] she said
[2:29:08] after what happened to me last night why
[2:29:11] would i be scared of anybody
[2:29:13] and i thought that was awesome i thought
[2:29:15] that was powerful
[2:29:17] you have a group of young people that
[2:29:19] you can and should be proud of
[2:29:22] they have an incredible reputation
[2:29:24] around the world um they are spoken of
[2:29:28] glowingly and look you don't have to
[2:29:30] tell us that they have battles and they
[2:29:32] have shortcomings and failures but why
[2:29:34] would you want to be on the side of the
[2:29:36] accuser i'd say we have incredible young
[2:29:38] people that are fighting with all their
[2:29:40] heart to get there and they're awesome
[2:29:41] and god has done some incredible things
[2:29:43] and
[2:29:44] um
[2:29:46] i'll try my best
[2:29:47] to give a short little speech
[2:29:53] 2017 i started having some very odd
[2:29:56] health issues believe it or not it
[2:29:58] started
[2:29:59] with my nose twitching
[2:30:02] and it was crazy how much it would
[2:30:04] twitch for weeks and weeks and like you
[2:30:07] could look at it and you could like
[2:30:08] literally just see it moving it was an
[2:30:10] odd thing and that we didn't know what
[2:30:11] it was and
[2:30:13] that's where it started and it started
[2:30:15] with something with nerves and i ended
[2:30:17] up going to the doctor
[2:30:18] and they found that i had strep
[2:30:20] and they started trying to treat that
[2:30:22] strep and
[2:30:24] for 40 something straight days i had
[2:30:26] strep
[2:30:26] and no matter what antibiotics they gave
[2:30:28] me no matter what they did it wouldn't
[2:30:30] touch it wouldn't go away then over the
[2:30:32] period of the next couple years i don't
[2:30:34] know the exact number but i ended up
[2:30:36] having strep i want to say 19 times
[2:30:39] and it was um
[2:30:43] they believed it had to do with some
[2:30:44] kind of autoimmune long story short they
[2:30:46] couldn't never really pin down what was
[2:30:48] going on why was this constantly
[2:30:49] happening
[2:30:51] things of that nature
[2:30:53] but then it started it triggered
[2:30:55] something i'm just saying what the
[2:30:56] doctor said it triggered something that
[2:30:58] caused
[2:30:59] something in the in the muscular realm
[2:31:01] and that's when they sent me over to
[2:31:03] houston some of y'all may remember that
[2:31:05] they sent me to houston to some
[2:31:06] specialists and
[2:31:08] and i didn't realize that when i was
[2:31:09] there but the doctor actually um she
[2:31:12] never told me this exact word and i
[2:31:14] can't remember it now forgive me some
[2:31:16] people are more detailed than me but she
[2:31:18] gave me a diagnosis and i didn't even
[2:31:20] realize it um because i guess it was
[2:31:22] more her opinion she had wrote i believe
[2:31:24] that if
[2:31:26] you know i believe it's probably this
[2:31:28] and i didn't realize that it happened
[2:31:29] until i ended up at my neurologist the
[2:31:31] last time um
[2:31:33] some tests and things being run
[2:31:35] struggling with with real weakness uh
[2:31:37] just to give you an idea sometimes how
[2:31:39] it could be and and just so some of
[2:31:40] y'all understand my strength has never
[2:31:42] changed in a sense that i can go pick up
[2:31:45] something
[2:31:46] that i always could pick up
[2:31:49] but my i began to lose muscle stamina to
[2:31:51] where i would have to take breaks
[2:31:53] brushing my teeth
[2:31:54] because my arm couldn't last that long
[2:31:57] or washing my hair
[2:31:59] or trying to clap through a song
[2:32:01] not have the the stamina to go all the
[2:32:04] way through and it was it was affecting
[2:32:06] things like i
[2:32:08] couldn't
[2:32:09] safely climb trees to hunt
[2:32:11] you know things of that nature because
[2:32:13] my muscles would give out
[2:32:15] and so i knew something was going on but
[2:32:17] the last time i was there at the doctor
[2:32:19] he made it he made the statement he said
[2:32:21] the doctor in houston
[2:32:23] says you have such and such and forgive
[2:32:24] me for not knowing the big word it's a
[2:32:27] word for a devil and um
[2:32:29] and uh
[2:32:31] and uh and he said i'm not sure that's
[2:32:33] what it is
[2:32:34] he said if it is it would be the second
[2:32:36] time i've ever seen it in my
[2:32:38] 30-something years of practice
[2:32:40] he said you'd be the second case i'd
[2:32:42] ever seen he said but what you described
[2:32:43] to me
[2:32:45] that sounds like it matches that he said
[2:32:48] but what we're going to do is he said
[2:32:49] we'll monitor it
[2:32:51] and over a period of a year or whatever
[2:32:54] he said you come back and then i'll
[2:32:55] build a no you know we'll have a better
[2:32:58] idea of it
[2:32:59] and i'm that person that i kind of
[2:33:01] refuse to google and look into
[2:33:05] the seriousness i just wouldn't if he
[2:33:07] said we can wait a year and monitor it i
[2:33:09] figured it couldn't be
[2:33:11] yeah you know i'm good
[2:33:13] um
[2:33:14] and i know this next part when i say it
[2:33:16] i know you could get this for many
[2:33:18] things you can be turned down
[2:33:20] for things because you have high blood
[2:33:21] pressure i'm not trying to make it um
[2:33:24] more than what it is i'm just saying the
[2:33:26] devil always has a punch coming
[2:33:29] and he knows how to get you with fear
[2:33:32] and he knows how to i've done my best in
[2:33:34] lots of ways to ignore
[2:33:35] a lot of symptoms and just push through
[2:33:37] things you know when i didn't feel good
[2:33:39] but right before we left for ohio uh
[2:33:43] you know when i left my job i lost all
[2:33:44] my insurance
[2:33:45] and stuff which is fine we knew that was
[2:33:47] coming but just because i'm a planner to
[2:33:50] some degree and i want to make sure my
[2:33:51] family's taken care of i wanted to get
[2:33:53] some life insurance
[2:33:54] so when you fill all that out you have
[2:33:57] to give them permission to go through
[2:33:58] your medical records
[2:34:00] and so i just got a letter
[2:34:02] and right there in it it had that
[2:34:04] diagnosis and it said
[2:34:06] due to this you
[2:34:08] you can't get life insurance
[2:34:13] that hit me pretty
[2:34:14] hard because they're saying in other
[2:34:17] words
[2:34:21] you know
[2:34:22] we don't want to give your wife this
[2:34:23] money
[2:34:27] so it hit me pretty hard
[2:34:29] and i was like
[2:34:31] so i went with a real burden on my heart
[2:34:34] that the lord would touch me and do
[2:34:35] something for me
[2:34:36] and we laid down and took a nap one day
[2:34:38] because as he said on the way down i
[2:34:40] fell asleep at five a.m
[2:34:42] after i'd preached i fell asleep at 5am
[2:34:44] finally i was very comfortable actually
[2:34:46] and your kids were amazing by the way
[2:34:48] they're quiet respectful
[2:34:50] i just couldn't sleep fell asleep at 5am
[2:34:53] at about 6 15 the sun started coming up
[2:34:56] and it was time for father abraham
[2:34:58] and every
[2:34:59] other sunday school song you could ever
[2:35:01] imagine
[2:35:03] so i was rolling on one hour of sleep so
[2:35:05] we got the idea i took a nap
[2:35:07] and when i woke up from the nap the lord
[2:35:09] was dealing with me about my healing
[2:35:12] and i
[2:35:13] i i don't know what to tell you i can't
[2:35:15] be very specific i just know in my heart
[2:35:17] i woke up and the thought was playing in
[2:35:19] my soul within my heart that you're
[2:35:21] fitting to see six months of constant
[2:35:23] improvement that's just i don't know
[2:35:24] where that came from but it was just
[2:35:26] rolling over and over and over and i
[2:35:28] said okay lord i'll take it i'll take
[2:35:30] the improvement i'll i'll take it all
[2:35:32] the way and walk into a well body
[2:35:35] and um i'm just gonna fast forward to
[2:35:37] saturday night cause i don't wanna i
[2:35:38] don't wanna keep you
[2:35:39] just know that our god is a living god
[2:35:42] he knows
[2:35:43] um
[2:35:44] and and he's not going to be defeated in
[2:35:46] any situation
[2:35:48] prayer line had started and i had not
[2:35:49] mentioned
[2:35:51] anything about my health i was feeling
[2:35:52] fine it's not something i talk about
[2:35:54] very often so it was not something i've
[2:35:56] been brought up we're praying for people
[2:35:59] we're probably about 15 minutes in the
[2:36:00] prayer line and i'm about the fourth
[2:36:02] person
[2:36:03] down in the prayer line and we just
[2:36:06] prayed for somebody and i looked up to
[2:36:08] look to see who the next person was
[2:36:10] coming
[2:36:11] but over here
[2:36:12] brother andrew was
[2:36:14] not taking the next person he was
[2:36:16] staring at me
[2:36:20] and he caught my eye and he looked at me
[2:36:22] and he said
[2:36:23] your total
[2:36:25] healing
[2:36:26] is here right
[2:36:28] now
[2:36:31] and i'm not basing my healing on on
[2:36:33] andrew spencer the word says by his
[2:36:35] stripes i'm healed
[2:36:37] that's always been there and that's
[2:36:38] always been the promise but sometimes
[2:36:40] when the devil strikes a blow god will
[2:36:42] come right behind it and say i got
[2:36:43] something for that
[2:36:45] i got something for that right there and
[2:36:47] it just sparked the faith in my heart in
[2:36:48] that moment when he spoke to me and it
[2:36:51] anchored in my heart and i can tell you
[2:36:52] it's a finished work that i'm healed for
[2:36:55] the glory of god that it's over with
[2:37:06] and regardless of what name they gave it
[2:37:08] you know even if i ever see that doctor
[2:37:11] again he's going to say
[2:37:13] the doctor in houston was wrong because
[2:37:15] there is nothing there that would
[2:37:16] indicate that this is what you had i
[2:37:19] know it's over with i thank you for your
[2:37:21] prayers i appreciate you
[2:37:23] you are an incredible
[2:37:24] incredible church body
[2:37:26] and you deserve to share in the spoils i
[2:37:29] believe amen god bless you
[2:37:38] amen
[2:37:40] well you know what happens
[2:37:42] when they return from the battle right
[2:37:44] after you divide up all the spoils you
[2:37:46] get to rejoice in it
