about manifested sons and speaking to our mountains and as i spoke to him that day having all the ministry team going with me i think there were five of us including brother craig boehr that went in with us to pray we prayed with him and i just said before he's before he um before we went to prayer i said brother kenneth what is it you want from god what do you want him to do you remember i i was

i said what do you want done and she said cut his head off we prayed that day and that's in that instance it went in to fight to try to find the cancer couldn't find a bit of it because god had done a work then we turned around with brother kenneth and in this situation he said to me he said brother tim our meetings are coming up it's our special meetings i want to be in service on wednesday night

he is a supreme god there's no god like jehovah amen and of course we know jehovah became flesh and his name was he specifically told him how to name the child and that would be jesus which means

come to a manger we came to see jesus here alive today 2020 he's alive glory 2 000 years ago it was a little manger it was just a little baby simeon held him as a little baby like brother tim held brother enoch this morning but when he looked into his face he didn't see a baby he saw a savior he saw the messiah [Music] can we see that today we look and we see things but god go beyond our sight today may the presence of god come into the service and be special today maybe we could pray one more time you would just say lord speak to me personal let's just forget around everyone else and all the shepherds and all the wise men all the noise and invite him lord we just want to open our our hearts to you today this message has gone around the world and it's not a little infant message lord a prophet speaking to denominational people but you're speaking now to people that have been living under this presence the rising of the sun this maturing word for many many years and today we're giving you glory we're giving you praises for your blessed presence and your nearness that we sense in this building the angel of the lord that was present in every meeting the pillar of fire that circled the auditoriums brother branham said in one place if you could see the angels that line these walls oh jesus appear to us today lord if healing is needed with that healing angel pass through the building through the internet go across the state lines oh jesus if salvation is needed it's not a picture of you on a cross that will save anyone it's you today in the building making your presence known to an individual that will say save me lord somebody needs filling you're the filler somebody needs deliverance you're passing by this moment if we could touch the hem of that garment bless this congregation bless the atmosphere they create for you and you would feel comfortable and welcome that nervousness and anxieties could leave that we could all be the gifts that you would desire us to be for 2021 lord this is our first sunday service so we want to consecrate ourselves dedicate ourselves one year ago if we would have known what was hap going to happen in just a few weeks in 2020 oh jesus would we have been more serious would we have leaned forward in our chairs would we have soaked in every moment that we could have had if we would have only known today we stand in your presence speaking to you you are revealing to us your mind and the season we're pondering these things we're meditating on the word of god so come holy spirit minister today to hands that are lifted up and hearts that are open i commit to you the word jesus let it be sacred let it be sacred lord jesus thank you lord in jesus christ's name amen god bless you would you just have your seats for just a moment i greet you this is very um surprise that we're here this morning um it wasn't planned just actually a few moments before uh the service i think your service on thursday we were making the final plan so this is all a surprise to us even those in our church that might be streaming you're probably as surprised as as i am so god bless you today and it's nice to see your faces six months ago we were here on a sunday morning and brother tim wasn't here he was at the hospital with the first lady of the church sister karen but i'm so happy that on this sunday she could come to church with you brother tim she could be in the house of god and we give you glory lord give you praises and brother chris smith i don't know if i've met you very much but it was a wonderful baby dedication for your son wasn't it who enjoyed that i i've got to hear brother chris's testimony and when i drove to church today with brother tim and sister karen there was room for a car seat in the back seat so i'm sure but brother tim uh wasn't joking when he said if you ever but when the little girls the sisters thought about brother tim taking him home i don't think they were very excited about that so god bless brother enoch elijah what a name with a name like that you know i feel like just sliding into the back row somewhere and enoch elijah may the lord bless the family and brother chris god bless you maybe i'll hear your testimony on the way to the airport amen but i think a deacon is going to drive me in a few minutes i've got to leave right away to be back home and right back into where we're supposed to be and so god bless you today and i just wanted to greet you from our hearts and when we come here um [Music] we know you usually from seeing you on the screens because we stream your services and we ask the brothers and the sisters about you and your faces and so i don't want you to ever think that you're just someone that sits in the assembly and no one notices uh there's a cloud of many witnesses that and believers that love you our assembly loves you i bring you greetings from many in our assembly that love you dearly and we've been able to share over the years uh sacred moments uh with your assembly and i want to thank you from the bottom of my heart and from our family and to the thousands i was talking to brother tim and sister karen about the thousands of young people that you have influenced from just your easter meetings and it's gone around the world and just throughout the years you've you have went from a little church in the in the forest in the woods to now god has brought his vision more clearer into the front lines and now there are literally many that stream your services or have been affected by your assembly you're not a little church in the woods anymore but you're an assembly do you all know that god has brought your testimonies and the miracles and the healings and the salvation and the impulses of faith that comes through this assembly it's gone global so whether you realize it or not god has called you to be on the front lines and this morning um speaking from our hearts if you see us with some notepads it's because the the message is so fresh as we were coming through christmas season we spoke a couple messages on christmas one in seattle a church and then one in our camp um a place where we worship on the u.s side of the border and there was just a phrase out of luke chapter one that was where we're going to be reading just a phrase brother johnny just a phrase that caught me and i thought maybe there would be another place or a place that i would minister that and i didn't know i would be here standing today i want to speak this morning on 2021 blessed is she blessed is she and uh is of course blessed is she is mary out of the scripture but blessed is she blessed is the bride blessed are you it wasn't and we're going to read the scripture i want you to notice it wasn't blessed is just the womb but blessed is the fruit of the womb blessed is the life that's going to come out of this womb so from a teenage young lady in the message came a savior hallelujah blessed is she and we can look back and look back but today i want you to we have all arrived to 2021 and if you see me looking in my notes it's because there's been things personal even on the airplane and coming that is very personal for this morning our whole lives have come down to this year all of our lives have come down to this year so blessed is she blessed are you in 2020 god bless you you can stand to your feet if you'd like to turn to the scripture thank you musicians and brother michael into the assembly luke chapter 1 as we have prayed already you're blessed and may the lord open our hearts to that reality today more than uh words on a new year's card or blessed are you or i seen new year's blessings more than a virtual uh something that we would have with our families and everybody would be clapping and smiling and you know sometimes it has to be virtual celebrations have become virtual everyone becomes distancing and they want to cover everything but right in that season of darkness comes a message blessed are you luke chapter 1 verse 26 if you can have some patience to read with me a few words of the scripture in luke chapter 1 verse 26 this was after elizabeth had become expecting and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god into a city of galilee called nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man engaged to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary and the angel came in unto her watch each verse here the angel gabriel came in unto her and said hail saluted thou that art highly favored the lord is with thee he didn't ask her do you feel blessed do you feel favored his brother aaron has been speaking on highly favored he didn't ask her her opinion do you feel special he said the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was just a teenager she was troubled at the same and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not mary or don't have no fear 2021 fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name jesus can we all say that name together he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end so that means it's still alive today does this assembly believe that of his kingdom there shall be no end hallelujah and then said mary i want you to look at verse 34 then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seen i know not a man i'm a virgin i don't know a man and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god and behold my cousin elizabeth oh what a wonderful sister elizabeth an elder in the message a well stricken sister in the church she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren for with god nothing shall be impossible and mary said behold the hands made of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her and mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste into a city of judah and entered into the house of zacharias and saluted elizabeth and it came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leaped in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost wouldn't that be great if that happened today for every believer just as the word was being spoken they were all all all filled with the holy ghost just at the sound of jesus there's so much power not just in those letters or if there's power in his presence blessed is she that would receive this into their womb and when she began to speak about it and talk about it life came power came and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost and she spake out now watch these next few verses and she spake out with a loud voice and said blessed art thou among women elizabeth is speaking to mary blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb whence is this to me that the mother of my lord should come to me for lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears welcome to church today as soon as the word begins to go spoken through your ears something happens inside of a believer as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears the babe leaped in my womb for joy and our last verse and this was the verse that stopped me a few weeks ago and bless it is she blessed is she that believed for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord we read all of these verses for that last verse blessed is she that believed and god bless you that believe today and god bless your 20 21 to you that believe god bless you you can have your seats together she was just a teenager mary was just a teenager and we see the morning sun coming up over the horizon and mary is walking down the road just a teenager as i was kneeling in our chair this morning in this room where i was and had opened the shades and the window was coming across the frosted grass and i i was just kneeling looking at these words of brother branham and the morning sun here is mary just a young lady her mother had passed away we're told and she was being raised by her father so life hadn't always been easy for mary sometimes brother branham would say she was 15 years old and other places maybe 16 and another place 18 but as mary is coming and the sun is rising she's making her way down a pathway she was thinking about what had happened the day before after coming from church see mary was a believer she was a teenager in the message but she was a virgin that was looking to the word as she was pondering as she was thinking about the word that had been spoken at the synagogue and we would say church today she was thinking about the day before and as the priest had took the scroll of isaiah was it isaiah chapter 7 verse 14 that he took a virgin shall conceive and in that service brother branham said the priest read the scripture and then there wasn't a lot of faith being mixed with the word that day she still had a question how's a virgin gonna conceive this has never happened before this has never happened that a virgin would bring forth a child that's impossible that a virgin shall conceive how is this gonna be and so now it's the day after and mary is with her engaged husband his name was joseph and joseph was a carpenter and they were engaged to be married so they were planning they were actually building their house if you read brother branham's message you would brother branham said they were already building on their new home so they were already planning ahead for the future and they came together on the day after the service and they were talking about isaiah and talking about what had been spoken in the service about he said the morning service and they were reading out of the book of isaiah and mary asked the question because they were having devotion that's what brother branham said so these were two believers they were interested about the season they were living in not just about isaiah's day but about their day welcome to 2021 it's not just looking back and describing the manger and describing shepherds and then talking about wise men that traveled two years and came to a little boy in a house that was maybe pulling at the at their uh you know looking at their sandals and he was maybe more excited about their camels than anything he's just a two-year-old boy that maybe got disinterested after a while because these men are giving gold frankincense and myrrh but he didn't understand he's just like any other two-year-old a child of evening like tabernacle we can look back and make dramas and have big plays and see it on a screen and we can talk about it and fantasize about what happened but friends we are living in reality today let's all wake up that it's 20 21. one year ago there was not be any of us that would have known what was going to happen in 2020 it just seemed like the world was going on and money was being made and families were being raised and things were churches were gathering and you were going to work and the hospitals were you'd say just normally feel but now something happened and and it causes a change it causes a global shift so today we're being forced to not just look back and then try to understand why and all of that but here we are this morning our whole life has come down to this year right now and i pray a blessing for you evening like tabernacle that eternity would ring through time this year that if you have been in a fog or been in kind of just going along that the lord jesus would make this season and his presence to you so real that while we are hearing the messages well you have the privilege of hearing the word like you do that we grab ahold of that and say god let this season of our lives be more real can we all agree like that i mean the the reason that brother john is here is because our side of the border cannot have a service today normally there might be a service tonight or we'd be able to gather we haven't been able to gather like that and it's not normal definitely not in canada at cloverdale bible way our church they're just down to the technicians and the speaker and it's down to just having the essential ones for the meeting and people are calling the police and you know there's cars in the parking lot and what's happening this is the climate we're living in the borders are shut down we cannot go to our church we cannot gather with other believers we cannot sing and raise our hands excuse me if we're a little bit kind of rusty this morning it's because we haven't been able to be in a church live service every week like you have i think we said that six months ago didn't we hadn't been in a service for a long time well with six months later and and there's times that we gather and times that we meet but in our certain state you know the governor and it's just like jesus's day when augusta wanted to attacks and it was a not an easy time it was not an opportune time to be a believer the government is saying you've got to go back to your town you've got to go back to city to be taxed and do you remember mary and joseph were from bethlehem but if you just are spiritual you'll find in the scripture so that it might be fulfilled what the scripture had said they didn't even realize when they stopped at the mountain just turning the the corner coming out of the mountain coming overlooking bethlehem and you know mary was just pregnant now with these months and and it's told that joseph just took her off the donkey for just a little rest she's a teenager just a little rest and is it possible that there would be room tonight that i'm just feeling such a heaviness such a burden it was a season they were in and and they could have been talking about politics they could have been speaking about the ruler and he was so mean and nasty to have us all go on the back of a camel and like you know there could have been excuses that you know there could have been billboards of you know the bethlehem eaglets are having a basketball game and they're going against the nazareth pinto lights or whatever and and you know all the designs and the things they could have been attracted to you know the camel races or whatever but their minds was not on the camel races it wasn't on lsu versus arkansas or it wasn't on the local governor what's happening in louisiana what's happening in california who's going to be president in a few days like they didn't talk about that it wasn't the main thing you say how do you know that it's because they were young people that had been birthed in their season they they were totally captivated with i'm trying to understand what would be the mind of the lord and you know the story there was no room in the end jesus was born in a manger and why why did it have to be shepherds we're going to get into that just in a little bit why little bethlehem and if you look at brother branham's last christmas message who do you say that this is 1964. do you brother branham went through the christmas season that and if you just are interested to look back in the month of december in the message you'll find a lot of wise why little bethlehem he preached that twice why little bethlehem why did it have to be shepherds this is his last christmas message and he was saying i spoke the other night in tucson why did it have to be shepherds and a few years ago why was it little bethlehem and he said the lord willing this is his last christmas message in december now he would never see 1965 christmas but the lord willing next christmas i want to preach on why did it have to be the wise men is that incredible he's already he's already projecting out there there was already burdens on his heart there was already inspiration friends we are blessed whatever happened yesterday we're blessed whatever happens today we're blessed whatever is happening in 2021 2021 we are blessed blessed are you that have had an angel interrupt your life praise god you were just going through your life and an angel a messenger a message interrupted you i thank god for that day and you know last six months ago we came here we did not know when we were coming that on the very hours before we would come sister karen would be in the hospital with a brain bleed and we would be standing here and brother tim wouldn't be at the serb we didn't know that and now we talk about it and say that was god just orchestrate today i didn't know but just a few hours ago we would be here but just before coming out i said i wonder if there's somebody here today that when we go through this weekend they will say i was the person that you needed to come lord send angels to come and visit us let the angel of the lord that dealt with so many of our elders in the message and gave them a birth and gave them a revelation of this message deal with us now in 2021 can we unite around that we could i'll get out of the way long enough and say lord send an angel he was already speaking about the next christmas why did it have to be the wise men these wise these wise wise he said they've got answers to them and they're right here in the bible he said here we find ourselves at christmas just about like they did in the first christmas the world's just about ready to fall apart brother joe couldn't have he had preached that this morning the world's falling apart who agrees with that well the world is collapsing don't get caught up in the collapse when they're going down we're going up when all the numbers are trending down and the stress and the nervousness and the sin and the morals is going down i'm glad that god sent a messenger to you and i'm here today to announce blessed is she blessed are you that have a womb to receive the word so that when it's spoken something ignites you and you become jesus in flesh aren't you happy about that mary blessed are you well how is this going to be and i don't understand that was a question how is this going to happen i'm just i'm a virgin and i don't know a man as she's walking down the road this was just what was on her heart she was pondering these things this is mary she's just a teenager we would say that under an inspiration even hearing it this morning when i first woke up and brother bradham said she was just a teenager and i was thinking about that but the world would say she was just a teenager looking down scoffing how could something so great come out of something so young brother branham described it like this her walking down the pathway and all of a sudden the light started flickering this is a teenager just pondering the sunday message and being with her engaged husband and thinking about their new home but it's not like she was all caught up in the coloring and the interior deck and the lighting and it wasn't that she was all caught up in that it was around her we have jobs we we have college we have school we all have finances is that true but mary was pondering the word not that mary was not stressed she was a teenager she was going through changes of life she was looking forward to marriage we we all have stress 2021 may very well have more stress and i'm just being very honest with you today in some of my notes i i mentioned about uh we we want to be personal as a minister that's very positive birth by a token that's very positive and we speak very positive that's even our nature to be positive but 2021 for the world looks very grim it looks very negative in fact what's going to happen in america is not all joy to the world and you might have heard that song in december in your local malls joy to the world but they have no idea they have rejected joy it's not in drugs it's not an alcohol it's not in sexual perversion it's not impartial and we see even it's not just churches that are being under these lockdowns but their whole economies their whole pleasure churches of stadiums full of of cheering roaring crowds even on a saturday even even today when they are still trying to squeeze out a little bit of pleasure from their nfl gods or they're nba gods but if if you look from one year ago the crowds that were cheering and roaring and the tailgate parties and all the enthusiasm now even the world is being squeezed down squeezed down is that true so don't get it in your mind some religious spirits that it's just people in the message that are in a squeeze the world is sensing a change we have come to another season and to you that are spiritual today locally and globally blessed are you they have received the angel in your day and the light started flickering and gabriel the angel was following her hallelujah brother tim if you want to find what brother john is speaking of today it's three messages of brother branham he spoke on mary's belief 1959 in april 1960 in march and 1961 in january here brother branham is coming through the whole year and in all three messages it's bursting into the first few months of the year he's speaking about mary's belief bless it is she it was like he was putting before the people this is the capstone god give us more memories in our lives gabriel the angel standing in front of her and brother branham said the angel was following her lord jesus let this be a blessing on each one of you today and throughout this year that god's angels would be dispatched to your life come on friends that whatever you have need of that it's not just you running to an angel or running to him but it's following you god's grace is catching up to you god's mercy is new every morning and that includes 2021. and we might be in a sunday morning service and kind of here now and it's 12 22 and we're just kind of sensing out the meeting and everything but little do you realize when we just calm ourselves and let our nervous frustration and our anxious hearts and sometimes our upsettingness just begins to kind of melt away brother haven just kind of melts away and we're in his presence but then there's just walking down the pathway of our life we're back to our thoughts and back to our day and back to our living little did we know little did mary know that was the day that god was dispatching to her visible sight an angel that was standing there lights flickering and we don't need hollywood to dramatize it for us she was a believer you're a believer [Applause] god made those angels appear to us and may we have a heart that says i believe that i believe what you're saying i don't even need to see it with my eyes but there's just a confirmation in my heart and there's a vindication something is real there and when you hear that about a brother it was the brother that was coming into the room to put in the microphone the batteries he's 20 years old brother butts and when we just begin to talk a little bit together you could already just sense that vindication in his life i don't need to know drama i don't need to talk to him about what happened since the last youth camp and you couldn't have youth camp last you know year and are we going to have it this year i don't need to know all about his family and his grades or the decisions he's making in his career it's just a few moments because people that are spiritual look beyond the dress look beyond the skirt they look beyond the hair they look beyond the cancer they look beyond the pain they look beyond the frustration of 2020 or whatever happened and they say as for me and this house we are going to serve the lord [Applause] and that's not just for the fathers or the mothers or the elders it's for all of us children and young people you are blessed the angel was following her i trust that 2021 is filled with supernatural events that the friends that i'm around the people that we associate with the circle that is texting or emailing or calling that you make your life around that it is people that is godly that is cheering you on that is encouraging you we have found out very quick how shallow the world is what a degree can do for somebody you know what making six figures meant a year ago and what it means today to someone that has now stayed at home and looked at a screen for the last 10 months and the violence and the domestic violence and the alcoholism that has spiked over 30 percent and the mental things that people are going through and the stress on families and i'm not talking about worldly people only i was just with a couple in the message that are married and have children from europe and i just spent a few hours with them a few days ago and we were just discussing about what this has all had an effect on them and on their families and you know streaming services only or they have little children and how do they connect and how how are they doing with their teenagers in their church and things that this is the very meetings that brother timothy pruitt was at a year ago right now and brother danny steeman they were at these meetings and you know you hear the music and you hear the services and there's hundreds of young people and it's gone global the effects but now today it is silent that room is silent where they had the prayer lines for the gym where they had the he were people that desired salvation that room is silent where people were filled with the holy ghost but i can tell you one thing or more than one thing but one of the young men that gave his heart to the lord in those services is serving god today his wife was baptized this past year they're serving god going on with god blessed is he blessed is that family blessed is that church that though they can't even gather like this in the congregation there are still people going on with god they are blessed so don't let your environment dictate to you your future if brother chris would have allowed his past to dictate his future he wouldn't even have been here today but brother enoch elijah has been given to the lord with a great opportunity to have believers and to have saints that are supportive and are cheering him on and i don't even know the family very well but to know that there's believers and sons and daughters of god that are cheering saying you are blessed and lord we give this little child back into your arms and if you notice brother tim's words in closing that he would be healthy that he would be strong i believe those blessings follow an assembly they follow families do you all believe that here i believe you are part of of that great success you are blessed today i don't know brothers and sisters i'm sure it is with you as the year 2020 ended and the new year of 2021 came in and maybe you've received a lot of well wishes and blessings from many friends family maybe other believers did you all receive some blessings half of you did you all receive blessings people texting emailing cards come in the mail and from from around the world and then locally good messages they're blessings well let me say it like this what if it would have been opposite what if you just would have got a bunch of cursings and swearings what if your circle would have been well just go to and it was a place you don't want to go to what if it would have been a gun in your face what if it would have been under a bridge somewhere that's where you live i drove into seattle it was three o'clock in the morning on friday morning coming to seattle to fly here and as when you come into seattle on the main interstate now now you have tents and you have tarps and you have people living homeless and under bridges and on the side of the road that's where the economy is that's where it's going i i think often a brother branham that saw the vision of his brother-in-law that on this side of the road there was just you know all kinds of little fires and things and he had tried to help his brother-in-law and try you remember that brother aaron he tried to help him and he'd just give up for alcohol in his life he had thrown it away and his wife left him and his children left him and brother branham was looking at that and then he looked to this side there in mount montana and he saw the peaks and he said your name your future is in that mountain do you remember that it had to do with the third pole in his life and all the dips and then the valleys and then the mountains and he had all of that but the voice said to him look on this side that's exactly what you'll be like if you go where you're planning to go and what you want to do in your life that's what you're going to be i thank god today we are surrounded by men and women that love the lord just give me jesus i mean we we kind of so think that oh it goes without saying right we're in church but to have a song leader say that's why we're here today do you just want more of the lord when some of you i know we're in the rock concerts and in the parties and at the places of amusement and you were just so energetic and trying to find your blessing your blessing and it turned to be a curse to know that god has turned that around in 2021 and stopped with an angel [Applause] you have been interrupted by a message that has said you don't need to go that way i know your future i know what lies ahead turn turn you don't belong in the pigpen you don't belong in this place even a believer let me stretch it out a little bit even a believer that goes through a time of sickness and goes to a time of pain and maybe something attacks them they're not called to be like that and they're groaning they're just stretching they're saying why and they're fighting against this something whatever it is say why is that it's a new body it's another place calling to you it's your blessing it's your final blessing one day but now we have trouble now we're in a robe of flesh oh yeah six months ago a year ago i remember brother tim the last sunday night that we were here and it was before your last youth camp and we were speaking about wine and oil and how you had been a blessing to countless many that were coming i think the very next week and you were sharing your wine and you were sharing your your church you were sharing your your ministry you were sharing you were to bless others and you you were to be you were giving that wine that stimulation so that somebody else could receive what you had and what does that create for you a blessing it's more blessed to give than to receive blessed is she have you been blessed gabriel it's while she's meditating and pondering on i don't understand how this could all be happening in my body and in my life that i bring forth a virgin you're gonna bring forth emmanuel an angel is talking to her do we believe the met the bible you know what brother branham said it's usually while you are thinking on these things the reason you don't see more of this we've got our minds on too many other things i just say god help us let's turn let's not just turn a new calendar from the very first sunday let us say lord i am i am consecrating myself this year that my mind not be on so many other things can we all agree on that this is january the very first sunday the reason that angels appeared to mary she was pondering the word she was thinking about the promises and that's when angels we it's usually why we are thinking on these things not following our our feed and our news feed and you know now our lives have changed you got certain time and if you give that to youtube if you give that to certain other things it's just empty it's just there's no power there there's no life there and you and you wonder why your life becomes powerless while you start to lose the joy why do you lose connection with people because you're more connected with a device god help us this year it's just an angel bringing that to our attention it's reality that angels appear to those that have their minds on the word let's go back to luke chapter one i wanted to just bring something to your attention luke chapter 1 verse 7. i want to bring something to your attention and this has to do with relationships zachariah and elizabeth were older ones in the message he was the high priest in verse 7 luke 1 7 they had no child because elizabeth was barren and they were both were now well stricken in years do you in verse 11 up there appeared unto zechariah an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar wow you talk about going to church and an angel is standing right there and he's got your attention and he tells you you're going to bring forth a son is that incredible your wife is barren i i looked it up how old they were and it's not real clear they they they were at least in their 50s or 60s or maybe even older it's incredible these were i'm speaking about the elders and the message and the older ones that have stayed strong and they were stalwarts zechariah was the high priest elizabeth was a believer and now an angel appears and says you're going to bring forth a son now i'm just bridging this over to something very important zechariah is going to ask a question he's going to ask a question and god was not happy with that and he smote him dumb for months until finally john was born or the word came to pass and he was able to take out a little tablet and say his name shall be john and he came his speech came out glory to god he was able to hallelujah and it came hallelujah i want to show you though how a question to one person can cause you to become dumb but a question that mary had a question how can these things be but brother david i don't understand it shows how you can have a question that is skeptical that is coming negative i mean zechariah was a believer but he questioned it in a way that caused him to be dumb here's mary a teenager that was younger that had a similar question how is this going to be i'm a virgin how is how are these things going to be but it brought forth life in verse 18 luke 1 18 and zechariah said unto the angel whereby shall i know this for i am an old man and my wife well stricken in years and the angel answering said unto him i am gaber and it goes on to speak about this wonderful wonderful this is wonderful this is the message this is the bible but what i wanted to bring to your attention is that he became dumb he couldn't speak for months because of a question and as it goes on in verse 26 an angel same angel gabriel appeared verse 27 to mary to a virgin and begins to speak to her verse 28 and the angel came unto her and saluted her and says you are favored you are blessed of the lord and verse 34 this is luke 1 34 then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seen i know not a a man is there a question mark there bible trivia question real open book question it's on the screen there's a question mark there right it's a question did god get angry with her did god strike her dumb did god do something that would cause his sharp rebuke for a teenager that should have caught it in the last meeting or you know the last meeting brother joe took a few weeks ago you should have caught it or the last youth meeting you should have caught it did he rebuke mary i'm asking a question so you can ask a question and it be with something's just not right zechariah could have says i believe you i don't understand it but yes lord this is he could have started weeping and saying that was the desire of elizabeth and my heart for many many years but it came from an unbelief and i'm going to major on that there was something in his heart that even though he was a high priest a minister an elder all of those years when it came to that year how was this going to be and god stroke him dumb but because god was moving in mary's heart and i want to bridge this with elizabeth now being older and well stricken in years mary being a teenager yet they had a relationship and luke chapter 1 verse 39 you'll find after the mayor the angel spoke to mary and mary arose in those days and went into the hill country verse 40 and she entered into the house of zechariah and saluted elizabeth so you have just a teenager heard from an angel coming to an elder in the message 60 years old maybe 70 she she also had had her husband had saw an angel had a pier and she was pregnant but there was there had not been a lot of movement in that season there hadn't been a lot of movement in the season elizabeth had the word she had the promise there had even been an angel up here to her husband but when she went home to talk about it her husband was dumb god help us but now a younger generation was coming up that believed the word they took a hold of that there was life and now they're coming together i'm not speaking anything negative this is actually very positive there was a relationship there was a connection it wasn't like mary ran to her teenage friends she ran to someone that was having the experience of the word at the same time hallelujah god give us friends this year that are spiritual let's rejoice together say i don't have a friend or i don't have a connection well why don't you just ask him on the first sunday of the year you've had a lot of friends break your trust they're not they break your confidence they do thumbs down they might be a christian but when you get around them they're negative they they're talking about you know the politics or the lsu or the camelites or whatever or they're talking about their truck or their car and you just want reality why don't you ask god for a friend like that this year just somebody you can share your heart with do you know what i got a note right here in front of me it's from my wife don't preach too long i got it right here brother tim she's probably streaming she probably just logged off right now but there's a lot of things we could speak about that about a confidant a confidant or a counselor someone you can share a secret or private matters with it you're trusting them not to repeat it to others you say this person was a close confidant of the president or the princes just she had a close confidant a best friend or a close associate and some of you might say where are you coming from do you know this comes right out of the book of isaiah speaking about jesus christ that his name shall be called wonderful he's a mighty god he's the prince of peace but he's also a counselor how many know the bible says that that's right out of the book of isaiah maybe mary wish she had a friend that sunday morning and when he they read out of the book of isaiah that said wonderful and she was saying i want to wonder i wish i had a friend that was wonderful i wish i had peace not as the world gives but i want some peace and then something struck his name shall be called counselor a confidant someone i can talk to and share my innermost feelings with and know that when we walk out of the room or we get out of their car or we leave you know the table that it's not going to be texted to three and five in the chat group and two days go by and you find out half the church knows and in a week you find out everyone in the message knows it's like that is not a confident you have just broke i will never trust you again it was in this season of christmas when god was giving a promise that i'm gonna send you a counselor i i know he wasn't born in december he wasn't born on december 25th but when jesus came he was expressing the counselor has arrived your peace has arrived your mercy has arrived your healing has arrived if you need the holy ghost today he's present in the building do we believe that blessed are you that would open up your womb that an angel could speak to you and you say be it unto me lord i trust you i believe that you're gonna hold these things in your heart it is an intimate partner somebody that is very familiar with you maybe it could be a mentor an advisor a friend you can trust you can tell anything but i just want to end this right here but to break confidence is a bad character someone share something with you or something that you you think if i go to someone else and tell them it's going to win some points or you're going to somehow rise up and no you have just shown that you need more of the life of jesus that's not the nature of christ it's the nature of christ to hold that in your heart pray about that seek and if someone is in danger if there is a need that you go to someone else that is a maybe a senior confidant or someone and you can share that family's in danger that child is in danger that sister there's things going on let's get some help but i'm here to announce to you today it has to do with jesus that might sound shocking but 2021 is a year for you to just open up your heart you say well i do brother john in prayer i open it he's my counselor i i talk to him he knows all about me and he still loves me and we can get all in that realm of god knows all about me and he still loves me when we can get all but there's situations you go through as a believer that you need god with skin on him on her and let me just turn it right away i don't know who this is for the last seven minutes i don't know who it's for but may this year you be a person that you could be jesus to someone else and manifest isaiah scripture and be peace to someone else be a counselor be a confident be quiet and just listen maybe my wife's logged back on now and she can say don't be too long oh don't you want that freshness this year don't you just want to come out of an experience with god where his presence is so near his anointing where it's something that's sweet and smelling savior it's the holy spirit on you that when you begin to talk when you begin your attitude is different your life is different that means mary don't let it just be words on a sunday don't let it just be something you would share with your friend and talk about the word or that you can look to another person and say that's a great man of god that's a great lady that's a real great woman and let it stop there but let 2021 i'm seeking to to minister to you a blessing let 2021 be a year where god can speak to you remember it wasn't just the womb that was being blessed it was the fruit of the womb it was what was going to come inside of that womb it was the life of god that was going to come inside of mary that was going to be the savior the healer the deliverer though it's just in seed form and that is what zechariah did not believe could happen they were old they were well stricken how can this be and god smote him it was a question sometimes you wonder why the holy spirit just maybe pulls back or why he's not maybe we need to just turn and be more like mary where we just believe the word of god well we just say lord for the next 20 minutes i'm going to turn on a message i'm going to read whatever you say to me but don't be all religious and all in some spiritual fanaticism where you just take it and that's not the will of god you say i read my bible i i fasted i prayed be sensitive let it be thus saith the lord i had this on my heart brother tim and we shared it together i know he has spoken to you as your pastor but as i had it for the new year and brother branham in the last christmas message of his whole ministry he said god give me a church that's so completely anointed with god till their every action and move is thus saith the lord now some of us have just we just cut off right there every action i mean brother john every action brother james how can these things be every action every move is thus saith the lord that that's a too high of a bar it's like trying to pole vault and it's 24 feet and you're just no no i'm not even going to try i'm not even going to run that's what a lot of us do we hear the word we hear great preaching we can be in dynamic services and then as for me and then we go out to our van or out to our cars no way brother joe can jump that high brother aaron is really growing brother brother tim brother timothy look at how their ministries have just but when it comes down to you it's kind of like short circuit kind of like the question mark and that is where zechariah failed and become dumb and and the power was lost let's be like mary's that have that quick heart to say i believe and it's not cutting off everyone else and i wish we had more time but i want to say that again about elizabeth and mary they had a relationship and mary went to her elder sister and they were rejoicing if you hear brother branham talk about it they ran to one another and elizabeth looked out her window and saw her cousin cousin mary coming to the house she was so happy she ran out there and hugged one another it wasn't all this you know static and thing but god gave us more relationships like that they believed one another and it's like how can this be mary you're expecting but i didn't know you were married and i didn't even get him uninvited sister adams i didn't even get in i'm your cousin no no it's not like that it's not like that i had an angel appear to me that said you're going to bring forth a child and his name shall be called jesus verse 41 luke 1 41 and while they were speaking some of you just thought a salutation was like i salute you you know i salute you but the salutation has to do with the words that are spoken it has to do with intercourse and a conversation they begin to talk about this his name shall be called jesus she's given her testimony this is what happened nervous nervous i never saw an angel like that before and the lights and the flick and i was trembling well what did you say well i said exactly what the bible says how shall this be i don't know a man i'm innocent i'm innocent you know what elizabeth she's hearing this you know but you're expecting but i i didn't know you were married no we're not married we're not married this was huge i this christmas i have got more respect for joseph than ever if you go to the book of matthew when you got some time math when joseph which was an older man than mary when he heard that his wife was pregnant my beautiful young lady in the message that she's a virgin and she's expecting the bible says he was going to put her away privately not on facebook not on instagram not with a broken heart symbol and send it to the church and to the message chat joseph was a man of character and he just realized i just get my hearts broken we'll just take care of this privately and by the way i'm crushed i'll never marry again that's what's going through his mind do you all know that that's what matthew's talking about he didn't want to make her a public example and embarrass her i'll let her go on and be a believer but i will not embarrass her but while he thought on these things he's pondering how can i handle this she's a believer i'm a believer she's expecting i don't believe you that you've been not been with another person mary how could you be this way and no no that there was a believing hearts there was believing hearts you know we don't have the we don't have the bankrolls of hollywood and we don't have all the millions and billions to make this more real but i pray the holy ghost so make this real the first sunday of the year how blessed you are joseph you're blessed you're handling this with dignity and he's ready to put her away and that very season while he's thinking about this the angel of the lord brother andrew while you're praying about this and lord what should i do what would bring the most glory brother george to your name lord you know my life you know everything lord and i know that i failed you i i'm not the best christian i'm not the most beautiful person in the church i'm not the best singer or the best preacher we all go through that emotion don't we say i'm embarrassed lord 2020 if i look back and you say is your life worthy of the gospel maybe some would say believers would say i'm embarrassed well i hope the the minister don't know or i hope the deacons don't find out we can kind of live under that but let's start out 2021 with a full consecration dedication and say i'm blessed that god's even talking to me like this that in your season of distress little do you know angels are already being dispatched go talk to that sister go talk to that brother let the opening song be this let the minister say something that i know that would be for me do we still believe in the same god that can speak through a dumb animal like a donkey to a person that should have known better a man of god that was going on a mission and and this donkey you all know the bible word for that right the donkey and he was slamming the guy's leg up against the wall there was an angel standing in front of me don't you see this angel he's talking to me the man of god that should have known better now an animal's having to talk to you and tell there's an angel standing in the pathway with a great big sword and saying you step another i'ma take your head off can't you see this angel and and and the prophet probably looked at this animal you and he's beating the poor animal god help us this year god help us we can get so stubborn so hard-headed so seeing it your way my way but the highway until finally god says you're going to walk down the highway then you're going to have that kind of attitude you're going to sow these kind of seeds that's what's going to come up in your garden you know friends only the blood of jesus has the power to cover 2020. only the blood of jesus has the power and authority to say you never did it let's wipe that clean let's go on let's turn not just turn a page but god fill us lord with that kind of character that kind of nature that will say lord be it unto me according into your word whatever you say i'll do that not a man god himself god give us more mary's and joseph like i was saying i was driving into our subdivision these last couple of weeks and joseph just came into my heart i thought my what a man joseph that just held himself in kind of a character that angels could appear to him can you put that up sister abigail matthew 1 20. matthew 1 20 while he thought on these things behold the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her as of the holy ghost wow all this all the churning ends all the wondering all the questions she just lays it all down there and says that's it amen wouldn't it be fantastic if it was all in one verse the whole everything you prayed for there it is it's called a divine intervention it's called being interrupted by an angel it's a teenager that's just taken a walk her life totally changes forever and he goes on to speak in matthew chapter 1 verse 20. verse 24 is exactly what 2021 needs to be for all of us then joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the lord had bid in him and took unto him his wife and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name jesus who would want to bring forth jesus this year blessed are you that you even have this kind of desire as we wind down now at the end of our service now as we come down to 2020 as we come down to us and a prophet says just ending his last christmas message saying lord give me a church that's so completely anointed with god till their every action and move is thus saith the lord where they walk in that shekinah glory and i'll show you a messiah an anointed one of god standing upon the earth does jesus deserve to have a bride like that in 2021 that will say be it unto me lord how many believe he's worthy he is worthy this is what i say to you today for your prayer life for your time alone with the lord and your secret time this year from this moment on may there be a presence of god and an anointing of a sweet smelling savor upon your life may the holy spirit visit you and may a message from god to your hungry waiting hearts be so clear that you would be walk out of that experience and say god spoke to me can we all agree hello everyone you got texts you got cards you got all kinds of blessings i bless you i bless you and all kinds of greetings and things brother john even put it in these notes today we have all kinds of well wishes and blessings from friends family believers but today when we really look into the deep parts of our hearts we are all blessed but when you hear all of these things that i just gone through and they have virtual celebrations and new year's resolutions and all the lights and the whistles and the salutations of people but the bride is going for something much deeper than that something beyond just the surface happy new year sister jessica happy new year and we smile we know oh that's nice thank you we get a text and we thank you we respond and thank you very much happy new year god bless your 2021 maybe two lines or three lines and then it's over god may this blessing be much deeper than that because blessed is more than just a touch to be blessed is more than just a passing blessing i bless you sister anita nice to see you this afternoon now and god bless your family and then we go and we fly away but the blessing that i'm speaking about blessed is she is now god's heart to the bride mary was blessed because she believed but the bride has been declared blessed because she believes the believers of this message are blessed because they believe but this morning that today it's more than a passing blessing it's more than just saying uh here's a good blessing i bless you but it goes then it goes away and it's no more or it's just a visit you know the family visited or jesus visited us today but then he's gone and i'm kind of back to my life i'm kind of back to my thoughts i'm back to my that's not a real blessing you say that song really blessed me that sermon really blessed me but a momentary blessing is not what the bride is craving for just help us now when when let's just turn back to luke chapter one now as we just see what elizabeth was saying in luke 1 41 and it came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leaped in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost and she spake out with a loud voice and said blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb it wasn't just a momentary shout shout o glory to god just like it was like wow mary don't you know how blessed you are that the fruit of your womb is jesus he's emmanuel it means god is going to be with us forever does everybody understand what brother john's trying to say that a blessing is more than god bless you brother and now we can't even hardly shake hands we say you know i can't even see you after service harley to shake your hand and just give me a big hug but it's like you know when we do this you know and it's like really really and the world's saying yeah really in fact we're going to tighten it down more and we don't know what's going to happen at the end of the month or february this is the moment when you hear god say after an angel has spoken to you that the lord has come to your womb and you're blessed for that full realization to become more than just a passing feeling and my the hairs came up on the on my arm or on the back of my it's more than that a blessing this is what elizabeth was saying blessed is the fruit of thy womb not your womb is blessed but the fruit what's inside of you is blessed verse 43 is a humbling verse and when says this to me that the mother of my lord should come to me she's an elder in the message saying this to a teenager it's like i'm blessed that you would even come and tell me about it what god's done for you that's an incredible testimony of how god has healed you right it's incredible it's a blessing like you say god did this for me and now we're through that god healed us from this certain thing and 2020 was a year and i hope 21. yeah i'm glad 2020 is over and now the birth of 21. but unless that revelation really drops deeper and sinks way down how blessed you really are that jesus christ has chosen your womb your life to be born in and to live the rest of your life he wants to live the rest of your life say how long is that for eternity does everyone believe that here eternal life is forever so you might take my body you might destroy it but inside of this womb is a life that is blessed and i'm a male brother saying that and so i'm not talking about physically i'm talking about in my soul in the innermost being in the inner heart of the heart is a life of god that has been birthed in this hour and i'm not ashamed of it we ought to be able to tell the world jesus is alive and others around us ought to see the blessings of god in your decisions they don't need to know all the details it's like wow i can see it on your face i i could just tell that sister she's living in another world because what was in her womb has now become what was private has now become public and you can see she's a great woman and we don't have time to turn to that but that's in first the second kings the bible says in shunam the shunamite woman she was a great woman the bible says that she was a great woman because she made room for the prophet a little bed a little lamp we would say a little light a little torch a little desk right she's a great woman and this year you are a great person when you make room for god's word friends you only have one life 24 hours you can do whatever you want to with 2021 it's like an open calendar and there's just a few exes now you know the first and the second here we are on the first sunday and you've got a few exes when i go home that's what brother john will do and i'll go in my office and i got a calendar from brother harold hildebrant and i'll go x x and i was in louisiana in the third x but now it's monday and you've got a life in front of you you've got a life in front of you don't you want to just just ponder and meditate on the blessing of god and the blessing is not oh i bless you it's not that we want a visitor that's just passing blessings we want more than just a good feeling that leaves but a blessing is to be a touch a touch that lingers it's an influence that stays to stay monday tuesday wednesday morning i'm thinking about what sister karen said this morning or yesterday it's that is a blessing that is mormon a momentary blessing it's a testimony i've been with the counselor on sunday what happened to you i was with the prince of peace when everybody's anxious and upset and don't know if you're gonna get laid off this this month or what's gonna happen with our finances and and what's going to go on in the schools are we going to do it virtual are we going to be at home are we going to go are we what what and we can get so caught up and consumed like that that we forget the blessing the blessing is something that just lingers it's like a hand on your shoulder it's an eternal deposit that brings interest to you that are bankers or interested in that the the blessing that i'm speaking about today is an eternal deposit that brings interest you just look and that just says more then it's more then it's more and it grows and it's like wow that's incredible did you hear what that minister said honey did you know this is what he said that's what the word says it's so great it's so much better than fussing and fighting i have it right here but brother branham said don't fuss don't get in family fusses angels don't appear to people that fuss families that are always fussing and fighting and throwing things and angels won't appear then they wonder why angels aren't following them why why they don't have help why do why is it always an emergency why is it always 9-1-1 lord send angels that follow us this year follow our attitude follow our spirit we try to go to a place that he doesn't want to go in we just feel something grabbing a hold of our belt and yanking us out of there we're like whoa lord you saved me you delivered me and not with some bad attitude i'm going anyway i'm going who are you to talk to me who are you to you know sometimes you need a friend that will tell you opposite than what you want to hear you need somebody that'll be really really strong with you and you're just kind of cringing and kind of like wow and you're wanting to defend yourself but maybe this year you could be a friend that would just be able to take it and then maybe it's something you're not even guilty of and it's being all spread around you know this happened she said this he said that but your character can just be one that you know what that's okay just let it go we're kind of quiet today but do you realize that's the blessing of god on you that's a deposit on you that is a lot more money than you had six months ago because six months ago you would have ranted waved and there would have been all kinds of e-men things that went out and they went back wow their phone lit up after that well now it's just silence because you're blessed you realize god's given you so much more you don't even need to go down that pathway in fact god's got a better friend for you that'll keep your confidence and keep your trust and if you're constantly trying to hold up some relationship where they're backbiting and seeing your hind your parts and telling you you're not a good christian you need another friend you need somebody that'll build you up to encourage you thank you jesus so as we close with these verses luke 1 verse 44 for lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears the babe leaped in my womb for sadness they were such mourning and horrible just so is that what it was john the baptist laying in the womb he's the second cousin to jesus he's gonna be born first he has six months ahead but there's no life it's like he's laying right in the womb of a wonderful lady elizabeth and zachariah it's a wonderful family but there's no life they've heard a lot of things and been down the road but there's no life but as soon as they got in an atmosphere where jesus was let's talk about jesus what's god's done for you does anybody have a testimony on the first sunday of the year has god given you miracles in 2020 did god heal you nobody 20 20 did god heal you then you are blessed blessed is she i have a message for you today from the king you are blessed [Music] say how do you take that well i'm a little embarrassed well not no you are blessed blessed is your womb blessed is the fruit of your womb i'm so happy that you would even tell me oh we need that in the church more from some of the older ones that with joy and happiness and you're hearing these things that's great and what god's doing with the young people what's god's doing over here happiness and joy and it creates a life man as soon as you started talking like that as soon as you started brother tim started talking about angels something started going inside of me it's like tell me more tell me tell me about the brother that's walking down state road number seven and god talking to him my that's incredible tell me brother winters what happened there at your place and you're putting up your walls and it says made in japan why do you have a desire for japan why are the believers from japan so connected to your church why are there people that want to give and you're blessed did you need to hear your name for god to to to for you to know well maybe sometimes we need god with skin on them sometimes we need husbands and wives to look at one another and say we're blessed it's not the diapers it's not the bills it's not the virus god help us it was one of the biggest distractions of 2020 was a global pandemic i believe the bride ought to be rising into 2021 saying we are going forward in the name of the lord it doesn't even need to be talked about every service we're not going to say covent 19 for the next week it's like why does that dominate our conversation why does it dominate our fellowship it's like let's start talking about things where angels are grabbing a hold of our doors our wheels are we just seeing angels appearing to us say brother john you're a fanatic well i tell you what if i hear from somebody this week from this church that say brother john on and give you a testimony an angel appeared to me in my house i'm not going to say oh yeah yeah right who are you and how long you've been serving the message i'm going to say praise be to god lord visit me my who is that person i'm kind of jealous you mean an angel appeared to brother aaron on tuesday at 8 33 where was i doing at 8 33 let me see that's 6 33 i was yes i was hearing a message from brother ron spencer that he was preaching just got over preaching and i want to hear that message that's what i'll be doing at 6 33 on tuesday probably and it's like wow lord you appeared to him appear to me [Applause] brother joe has been talk he stopped all of a sudden in his service talking you know it was january this and he said you know what we were real busy talking about the finances of the hospital we had meetings and all kinds of things but you know what when i got in my car i just felt a presence do you know what that was it was angels following brother joe and you know we can click on the news and what's the news coming out of shreveport what's going to happen or we can just say lord i got 20 minutes come and talk to me as soon as i heard that something began to move and our last verse of the service luke 1 45 and blessed is she that believed blessed is she that believed for there shall there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord not everybody's opinion not what somebody said about you but from what the lord said thank you very much i'll take you whatever god says about it that's what i'll take if god gives me a blessing i'll take the blessing and there will be no curses part of that blessing now the devil wants to keep all kinds of curses on you but it's time to just walk away from the devil and say i have no time to talk your language this time i'm not talking your language say but that's the only language you know for the la no i'm not talking your language an angel talked to me i feel blessed i feel like something's moving inside of me i want to come wednesday night i'm going to come next sunday as long as the church doors are open and they'll let me in there maybe sit way up in the mezzadine somewhere just let me in the place do you understand how blessed you are there's people in south africa streaming this service right now that would love to be in a service like this there's people in canada that would love to be in a church like this and be when brother michael was singing i just raised my hands they don't have that privilege it's been taken away so as long as you have it there ought to be praises hands lifted up not folded and oh preach to me it ought to be glory to god hallelujah i'm not here to receive i'm here to give you i'm not a taker i'm a giver blessed be the name of the lord god was our healer in 2020 he's present in the building 2021 he's our healer [Applause] we pray for a vaccine but it's not a vaccine that's going to deliver us from the virus it's called god's blood and the stripes that were put on him but i will take a virus to get on a plane and come preach to you next time and you can get all quiet all you want to but the lord willing i'll be crossing the border in a few days and if i've got to have a virus one or a vaccine so i have vaccine one day to go and minister i'll do that not for myself but for somebody else if that's what they want if that's what they declare i'm not going to get all stubborn no no no friends god will protect us god protected us before 2020 god still protecting us the lion of the tribe of judah he stands there mighty in battle and it's not in the sheaf it's like lifted out saying onward boys onward girls onward families your miracles in front of you you say i'm believing for a miracle i need a miracle we serve a god of miracles you you believe that regardless of the circumstance and if god takes you and you slip into another body amen then your miracle happened you have a new body with no pain no suffering i looked at a picture of when brother tim and sister ken just when they were just getting to know one another and just knew and it's like that's what they're gonna look like that's what they're going to look like this old grave this whole body ain't going to hold us down you can't hold us down in a moment in the twinkling blessed is she as our musicians come we have been blessed with salvation we are blessed with amazing grace we've been blessed with mercies that are new every morning 2021 we are going to be blessed with a song in the night don't be distracted i'm giving you some last final thoughts here we are blessed with a god that answers prayer we are blessed with thousands of promises we are blessed to receive a message and believe a message no matter how many websites and people walk away or disbelieve you ought to feel a great blessing lord i believe an angel interrupted your life and you said lord i believe that let a thousand walk awake sister kathy just let a thousand friends family and everybody but you're gonna say lord i believe why do you believe an angel met me one day i can do no other take my life just take my life and i know in just a moment i'll be in another place we've been blessed with a new spirit and a new heart maybe you need that as we close receive it in the name of jesus you've been blessed to receive the holy ghost there's no reason why any person in the service or streaming right now or later cannot receive the holy ghost right there where you're at don't disbelieve don't become dumb say lord i receive this as we stand to our feet as they play something as we bow our heads i wonder how many could just receive the message that we heard today we are blessed to re possess rapturing faith we are blessed to see a resurrection we are blessed for a rapture we are blessed for a body change we are blessed for a family of saints we are blessed for heaven we are blessed for a future home we are blessed for a millennium we are blessed for eternity blessed is she god fill my soul right now fill my spirit right now fill my body if there's needs lord may everything that is not of god just believe my body in the name of jesus i claim healing i claim deliverance lord over every sin issue or problem in my family right now i am speaking your name over that lord can somebody believe out there mary are you in the service today mary mary do you really know do you really know how blessed you are [Music] lord we just want to worship you and lift up our hands for a moment blessed be the name of the lord that's why we read in the book of revelation when john saw heaven and earth they saw these things coming to pass in the opening of the word the opening of the book they cried out hallelujah glory to god lord may this not end at the service may this not end at evening light tabernacle here at the service but let it be when we leave here in our cars in our automobiles at our homes they are sisters lord with their hands and their dish water just maybe pause for a moment and say oh jesus i love you with all of my heart maybe there would be another teenager today like was in the welsh revival and the churches were dead the churches were formed on the bars were coming down and the sheep were jumping out and the goats were coming in and they say how can this be how can this be when on a sunday afternoon a teenage young lady lifted up her hands and said lord jesus i love you with all of my heart and the holy ghost fell in that meeting and over a hundred thousand souls were one to christ throughout that whole region because somebody expressed their love for the lord [Music] oh jesus we receive you right now we receive your presence we receive what you have for us in 2021 we stop and pause and say lord god like mary maybe did how can this be how can this be
