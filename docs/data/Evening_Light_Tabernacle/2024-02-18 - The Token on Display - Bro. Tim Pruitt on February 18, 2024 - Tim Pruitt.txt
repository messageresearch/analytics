service on Tuesday you know our sister Helen Williams is been coming here aart here and it's got to be hard having another one of her children pass away and here she's in her 90s we just need to ask God to give Grace during these times you know it really shouldn't be so much a time of sadness when we know the joys that lay ahead man we got a couple that here in our own church that are on hospice and you know may cross over anytime that we don't know when they will cross across the the division line between Time and Eternity but it's close for them so we're just asking God's mercy upon all let's bow our heads father we love you and we thank you Lord along life's journey you have helped us to forge friendships because of a Brotherhood that Brotherhood because comes because of a father and Lord that makes us all brothers and sisters and we thank you Lord for the privilege that we have of having wonderful people in our lives Lord that men and women who have run the raced before us and and left um big tracks for us to walk in and follow and Lord I I feel that way about uh the Dyers I I believe they were just some of the most wonderful people Lord the cream of the crop the

that has uh loved ones that are about to cross over that you just be merciful Lord I I get Mirage just all kinds of prayer requests from different places just because they know that we're people of faith that believe God and and trust him and know his word comes to pass some of them are financial needs some of them are serious physical needs of cancer and trouble uh Lord that that that call on us and and write us sometimes almost daily father you know every situation and I pray that you'll meet the needs of your children and across this land lord May Faith rise in the hearts of people in in spite of the adversity that we're in Lord May something as we look at the adversity swell up within us something rise up that says greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world I pray that you'll give strength to your people across the world across the globe wherever they are some of them already had their services may you just meet their needs Lord Lord I pray dear God for your this part of your elect right here gathered this morning we are in this service but father we have not gathered in vain because you said you would be here and Lord we want you to be them the principal theme of our talking our walking and everything we do or say we want it to be you and we surrender ourselves to you to serve you today Lord may you speak as you never before so clearly so precisely to Hearts may you be here the discerner of the thought and the intent of the heart even repeat back conversations Lord are the thoughts or ponderings of men and women in this church and across the world Lord as they listen in May your name be glorified may you be magnified Among Us and your name lifted high and your people edified and blessed in your presence we ask in Jesus name amen and amen God bless you let's turn to John 4 and verse 19 and as we're turning there I want to thank you for uh your continued Mission offerings that you give and things that um you know we continue to support the little church in Japan with um with uh help every month on their rental facil ities and we have um we have had since the time that you uh gave that nice wonderful Mission offering here some months ago back in 2023 we we've been able to have another 100 nearly 130 more translations um made and put there on the on the web for every Japanese believer anywhere around the world and some of these are are just very very um pertinent sermons that that will be something that will strengthen them and help them and um we we want you to realize um you know that you're part of this ministry and a part of that so you know if you ever have a mission offering you want to give or always just take an envelope and put a missions on it we'll make sure that it goes for that purpose and sometimes it it will be um maybe maybe to uh places in Africa sometimes it will be to Japan sometimes to to the Philippines I can't promise you unless you designate it exactly where it will go but um I will tell you we'll use it try to use it for the glory of God so if you'll turn with me to John 4 and verse 19 we're going to read from there this morning and this of course is a woman at the well who has had a Divine appointment Jesus had a need to go by her way and the woman said to him sir I perceive that thou art a prophet our fathers worshiped in this mountains and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship and Jesus said unto Heroman believe me the hour cometh when you shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father you worship you know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth amen God bless you can be seated we're going to today speak on the um the token on display now we we have come to the hour of true worship where that we have just read today and and I believe it is an hour like that of true worship where we must be worshippers of God in spirit and in truth and of course you know this is a a special hour a day that we're living in because this is the day the hour that the bride must be glorified you remember in the days of Jesus the hour came that he had to be glorified and and um and of course we are in that very same hour now as we have moved from from the calvary now to through seven Church ages um to the last day and it is the hour then that the token must be on display and and and this is such a vital subject uh even brother Bram recognized this to his soul because he and referring to his sermon on the token he said it's the highlights of my entire Ministry and I think what kind of emphasis that he placed on this vital subject that it would be the highlight message of my entire Ministry and so the highlight of course is the highest point or you know or what all of his ministry was pointing to and and and just sharing what he said about it I I know that everything is worked for months and months and months up to that one message and moving to come to that place it was a capping off time of it so he spoke of it as being the height of his ministry the climax the the capping off and he and and of course he uh spoke about that after and then at thinking about the Seven Seals that had been revealed he said with all the messages I ever brought that was absolutely ordained of God outside of course the regular commission like the Seven Seals and things that was directly the word of God I'm talking about a message to preach I believe that was one of it see that that needed to follow those Seven Seals and then he said now what's what came after the seals uniting of the people he spoke on uniting time and signs and United signs and there the red light flashing in the last days the sign of women getting prettier and man what they would do and all these signs of the holy spirit head leading up then come back here to the capping off of all those messages since the seals is kept up in this one thing the token that we're all right just check ourselves to see if we're in the faith and of course I you know I think even in this moment as we go now forward now actually many years from that we I I am convinced we have we have arrived at the zero hour where the death angel of course is in the land and there are screams of death and dying everywhere and and of course there's going to be a people that is going to escape the things that are coming on the earth and they will be like Israel when they left Egypt out that first time that they left out with a high hand and I I believe we're going in a Rapture I I believe there is an escape there is a way out of here that we won't go through the judgments that are coming upon the Earth but we are at that Zero Hour where that you must be prepared and and you said well brother Tim I made that a long time ago it's time to really make your calling an election sure there can't be any guessing any wondering any pondering any any anything there you got to be sure that you know that you know that you know because to leave here you must have a a ticket a a sign a token that your sin debt has been paid and the only token sign that will be accepted is the Holy Ghost when I see the blood I'll pass over you now of course of course you know um Peter would would tell us like this he said you you got to add your faith virtue virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and then of course be capped off with the love of God and of course this is a process of sanctification that caps off a person with the very divine nature of God the Holy Ghost this is the same charity that the same basic quality of divine nature that Paul spoke about charity is not some Meely Meely um we see wasi gooey love charity is the Holy Ghost you see it's the divine nature of Christ it's God's basic nature and and though you speak with tongues of men and angels though you have prophecies though you have all Faith to move mountains and though you give your body to be burned or though you you give away everything you have to feed the poor and though you understand all of the Mysteries and have all knowledge if you lack the Holy Ghost is all for nothing so this is how important is now of course you have the Pentecostal say we speak in tongues that's our sign we have the charismatics that says we move mountains with our faith you know we have the the Catholics will say our nuns our monks take a our poverty the Jehovah's Witness will say we have actually given our bodies to be burned we we believe what we believe so much that we have actually you know been killed and persecuted by it for it and many message people will say well we understand all the Mysteries but I just want to say again if you lack the Holy Ghost it is all for nothing Peter said this in second Peter 1 and8 for if these things be in you and abound it shall make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lath these things is blind and cannot see a far off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure notice what he said give diligence to make your calling an election sure oh I'm elected brother Tim I'm predestinated I I know I'm a predestinated seed and I know that God is has called me and I I'm elected and and whatever he said make sure give diligence to make your call and election sure because if you do these things and he's just talking about adding your faith virtue virtue knowledge knowledge Temper Temper patient patient brother uh brotherly kindness and godliness and so on and he said if you do these things if you have been capped off with the Holy Ghost you will never fall for such an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ this is what we the token is it's an entrance that is ministered to you and God is requiring a token is it's a sign that the lamb has and that the death of the Lamb has been applied so that the death angel can pass you see a token is a sign there there is a train that is Bound for Glory and you must have a ticket a ticket showing that the purchase for your journey has been paid for you cannot just show up you know even to get on an airplane without a ticket that's right with without some kind of proof of purchase that that it is your fair has been paid for you now a a Baptist might present his works and and say you know I've made my profession of faith and I confess with my mouth the Lord Jesus Christ and and yeah if you do that you shall be saved did anybody get that you shall be saved if you you really make a profession with your mouth a confession with your mouth and Believe on the Lord You're Going To You shall be saved you're going to get the Holy Ghost that's right but just a mere confession with your mouth ain't going to get you there a Catholic will present his works I've been baptized since an infant I I pay my pray the Rosary every day I burn a candle every night a Pentecostal will say well I spoke in other Tong s a charismatic will say we have performed Miracles and many marvelous Works in his name and you know the answer to that there'll be many like that that day he'll say depart from me you workers of iniquity I never knew you and some some others will say well I believe every word the prophet said I believe the Mysteries you know I believe but none of this won't work to get on the train so some of you will say depart from me now the first time this word token was used in the Bible was to use to describe the sign of the Covenant with Noah God set a rainbow in the sky and proclaimed it as a sign of the Covenant that God would not destroy the world again with water so again it's a the rainbow is a sign of a covenant the second time it was used USS was when God made a covenant with Abraham that God required a token and that token was a sign of circumcision the penalty of not having the sign of circumcision that token was to be cut off from God and His Covenant God used the word again to Moses giving him a token a sign saying that this will be the sign that I will surely be with you that I'm not only giving you this sign of a pillar of fire but you will bring the people uh from Egypt and worship me upon this mountain now what a comfort that ought have been that no matter what the opposition that he knew that you you know the word of God said you will serve me on this mountain I'm going to give you this mountain as a sign I appeared here on this mountain and you will bring the people right back here oh I don't know how many times Moses must have have looked at it when he felt opposition when he saw the the the the Pharaoh do what he did and hardened of his heart but God you said you would get me to that mountain with his people he gets boxed in with the Red Sea and maybe Moses forgot but God had said and God didn't forget amen I've given you a sign and that sign is is uh you're going to get across this Red Sea I you know makes no difference what's around you how much enemies behind you you're surrounded everywhere there's no way through just go forward because you know the mountains on the other side sometimes I don't know what to do sometimes I don't know how to respond sometimes I don't want know how in the world we're going to get through the the the troubles and the problems that are in this age but I'll tell you God promised amen he gave us a Holy Ghost and he said with this sign I'm going to take you in a Rapture I'm not leaving you here and when I see the calamities when I see death everywhere when I see problems in the world and problems in our nature I know this he said he said I'm going to take you through I'm not going to leave you here I'm going to take you in a Rapture I there will be an escape for the thing that are coming upon this Earth no matter the opposition now in Exodus 12 God you know it was declared that God would judge the people in the land of Egypt and you can be making your way over to Exodus 12 in your Bible we'll read it here from verse 11 here in a moment you can actually put it up and just hold it there but I want to talk about it just for a moment as we as we look at this that there was coming an a death to ever firstborn so it was announced in that Exodus death is coming death is on its way and look all had sinned there was nobody that was Guiltless and I look upon you today that's exactly what you were all of us have sinned and none of us was worthy right every one of us if we got what we deserve let me quote brother brandom said you'd go to hell that's what we're deserving of we don't deserve a rapture we don't deserve heaven we don't deserve to escape death if we've got what we deserve listen listen you say brother Tim I I've been a very very Wicked person every one of us have been there maybe not doing what you did or what you did but just to be if we sinned in one point we were guilty of all of it I was a sinner just like you are a sinner right if I have got what I deserved I'd have went to hell and and I didn't you know May and I you know I've served the Lord since I was a very young boy so I certainly didn't get into a lot of you know horrible sins but that don't make a difference every one of us has to have a token because every one of us you know are in that place look all deserve punishment I want that to be clear all all deserved punishment Israelites foreigners Egyptians everybody in Egypt deserve punishment and death was on the way and a representative of every house of firstborn of every home in the nation would die in that home it didn't matter if it was an Egyptian or an Israelite none words exempt every place had to have death in it it was under judgment death will be in Egypt from the Prest house to Pharaoh's Palace there will be death and Goan in every Israelite dwelling and there too the firstborn will die I want you to understand every one of us without exemption have been under the sentence of death that's right that's right all the way back from Eden the day you eat thereof that day you die but you see in that moment of time there was not just a message that death was coming but there was also a message of Grace that favor was also of all the people who would hear a message that would be brought by a pillar of fire to a prophet and here he would come out of the Wilderness with a message from God and saying listen the death is coming it is a judgment is on the line judgment is everywhere but I tell you what and we're we're all under that message of judgment but I tell you God has a covenant with you amen and in that Covenant God has provided a substitute a firstborn lamb without blemish and he will die in your house and there will be a death take place in your house and with that death there will come an Escape right that's right the Wrath that you deserved would be poured out on the lamb and the lamb would die in your place thank you Jesus a firstborn lamb without blemish its blood would be a token a sign a sign on the door on the lentil a sign on the sides this sign would be would show that a firstborn the lamb had been accepted as a substitutionary death and his blood has been applied and now displayed and this is what we're seeing here the displaying of the blood on the door and this would show it would be a sign that the death angel would pass over here because there's this sign shows the first born's already dead are you with me amen now there were to be seven days of unleavened bread which would represent seven Church ages where nothing but pure unadulterated word was to be eaten the seventh day would of that Feast would be a feast to the Lord of unleavened bread and we come to Zero Hour and we are like Israel in that same time as like Israel when they were leaving Egypt and the Death Angel is going through the land and let me just say again in America our freedoms are dying people are dying spiritually families are dying churches are dying and I I tell you you can see the effect of it that is happening everywhere that you look you can see death happening in the families Death happen in fathers death happening in mothers Parenthood there's death in it motherhood there's death in it in our school RS of learning death in it we have a whole leftist agenda that is there being pumped out and a whole generation of people filled with death our values are gone families are dying churches are going dying there's hardly a there's hardly a thing that is happening you know it's more and more and more going more secular toward just dead religion that's right cycle of Revival and death never fails yeah I'm trying to PL paint a bleak picture because that's what it is I'm trying to get you to see we ain't in haha land this is not a time of of of to be frivolous and you know just having a bunch of gity this is a time of really sincerity if we ever was sincere and we we must be continually and Passover with all the leaven and sin gone and drinking the wine of the Holy Ghost and eating the lamb the word of God and and with the blood the Life of Christ the very life of Jesus the Holy Ghost applied so you see he would tell them you will eat it as a people prepared to leave let that sink in for me a moment a people prepared and I we this journey you don't pack up to go you unpack that's you get rid of the leaven amen amen you get leen's a type of sin come on somebody amen you shall eat it with your loins girded with your shoes on your feet your staff in your hand and and ye shall eat in haste it is the Lord's Passover th this was a required ready us for any moment the trumpet's going to sound and when the trumpet sound you're going to leave Egypt am and I tell you that's exactly where we are in time we have to be in a state of preparedness prepare for the coming of the lord we are in it get ready make sure amen you you got your staff in your hand you're your your loin cted your shoes on your feet you know you're ready you're eating it you're eating in haste come on you're not you're not staying out of church and and just finding excuse after excuse no you're not doing that you're you're eating the lamb in haste you're in a hurry let's get this done let's let's get every word of this let's not miss a thing let's the the Lord is is doing something in this moment of death God's doing something among his people amen and and so therefore let's get ready to leave for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and I will Smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and Beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for a token that's a sign a up on the houses where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt now listen it's not going to do any good to have that blood sitting in a bucket in the house it's not going to do you any good to have a collection of 1100 k and Bible's in every translation imaginable none of that's going to work what he says I've got to see the blood I got to see that the a lamb died for you or otherwise death is coming here and death is coming on churches death is coming on homes death is coming on individuals sir we're in that hour but in that hour there's a people going to escape death The Pale Horse is about to be released for his ride and if you know anything about the horse riders of the Book of Revelation you know it starts out as a white horse and then it becomes red it's same horse same Beast same power same Antichrist and he finally you know it morphs as it was and changes red with the blood of the Saints as it kills and then the Dark Ages it becomes dark and black and then the finally it goes into the pale but this Mars from one to the other and I want to say it's more gradual than instant the first splashes of the red blood of the Saints turning that bloody red would may maybe still had Part White further it went it's all red right then it starts turning dark and it goes in from dark red into black into total darkness and then we're moving now from that and you can see the pale begin to mix right in and the Bible said his name is death so if I'm not right if you don't think I'm right this is the Bible the Bible said in the Book of Revelation that he's coming and his name is death right well it was death all the way in the first age when it was a white horse it was come on it was the Antichrist it was death then it was death and there but now he's coming in his full power and the Bible said hell follows him and I'll tell you what if you want to stick around here for hell you can but I don't want to to do that Hallelujah and I'll tell you this the fourth horse rider cannot go incompletely he cannot turn totally pale until the bride leaves but we're so close you talk about the lamb that rose up in Revelation 13 with freedom of religion with civil and ecclesiastical Powers he looked like a lamb but in the end he started speaking like a dragon and we're hearing him more more speak like the dragon Satan himself this is where we are that's right we're in that hour look at you know we we can we can hear him coming and man we we hear coming we see the precursor of at the forerunning as as the Winds of War and strife are already blowing we look at Israel now we see them there having to cope with the most evil murderous Spirits killing young and old ripping open bellies of pregnant women taking infants and putting them in the oven hideous heinous crimes hate like you've never SE it is not just a war it's a spiritual war I I hope you hear what I'm saying because right now even against you it's a spiritual war and it's a it's a the devil hates you and he's pouring out his Venom everywhere that he can amen and there he comes to Rob and to kill and destroy your life your home your marriage your everything your husband your child he don't care young old you come against the church and come comes there to Rob to kill and destroy comes there murder us with heinous crimes he don't care how he hurts young people he don't care how he hurts the children he don't care how he hurts the old people he don't care there there's there's no mercy with him that's the spirit of the world hates the Holy Ghost the spirit of the world hates Holy Ghost Services the spirit of the world hates Divine Healing yes sir the spirit of the world hates prophecy the spirit of the world hates anything super natural and they will sit there to find some way some justification to kill it they despise the blood I want you to understand this Blood even here was a despised blood it was a despised blood the spirit of the world there in Egypt despised that listen Egypt we Egypt worshiped cats cats is a representation I don't care if you have a cat let me give a dis you know qualification right there have a cat enjoy it but don't worship it you know the difference between a dog and a cat right dog look at you and say you're so adorable you're a God you just provide everything you're whatever and you pet a cat and he says I'm a God pet me e worship cats but they despise sheep and Shepherds hello somebody amen this is why Joseph told his Brethren who by the way were not allowed to eat with the Egyptians because of being Shepherds were despised look down on people and and in and in Genesis um Joseph told them said you say your the servant trade has been about cattle from our youth even to now both we and also our fathers that you may dwell in the land of Goan forever Shepherd is an Abomination to the Egyptians so even to be a cattle Razer you were a a a low class person and and then and then of course Egypt was an agricultural land and their diet according to numbers 115 was mostly fish and cucumbers melons leaks and onions and garlic some say sheep were detestable to them and considered unclean think about Egyptians they were meticulous with hygiene and cosmetics several ancient Egyptian records have been discovered and shows how to take care of one's skin preventing aging does that sound familiar papus has been found that contained instruction for hygienic and cosmetic prod care products like mouthwash and perfume they they were very you know very meticulous about the body they smell whether mouthwash perfume you know hygiene Washings cosmetic care you know show showing yourself younger than than what you were you know there was instructions even on how to get rid of your gray hair they wore fine linen linen is very breathable meaning that they didn't sweat as much in the desert heat you know and pure linen is also has a quality of being odor resistant but Shepherds were low class of people they were not rich enough to afford linen but certainly had access to animal skins which to make their clothes so wool and other animal skins were the most popular materials from the for of them who would come from Canaan you know they were like the the low class they wor like the low class Garment of John the Baptist a cloak made of hair that were stinky they were considered unclean I want you to get it I want you to see there there was a class difference there was different emphasis on dress and how that they did homes of middle class Egyptians were kept to a high standard to an Egyptian Lamb's blood on a door was an would make it an unclean dwelling Lamb's Lamb's offer to God was a high offense and this is why Moses said let us leave it and go to the Wilderness for our sacrifices on our Abomination to the Egyptian the very thing you are offering to God our people hate detest disdain your worship is detestable to an Egyptian the world cannot stand who you are you get oh yeah you get blood all over you you when you worship come on the blood is the life and when when when you listen listen I I I don't want to get too gross here for but for a moment but for you to understand I mean I I raised animals butcher many of them but they would take and just stroke that animal there find this little juggler there and quickly take a knife and it would begin to spurt out blood with awe every heartbeat and you can't do that without getting blood on you and I just want to tell you if you ever get in a church where the blood is Flowing where the holy spirit is moving and you really are a worshipper you can't help it but get spirit all over you and the world hates it but God loves it you get so bloody listen that's the way that an eagle is he is a ripper of the beat amen a a real a real Eagle can be forced not to eat carrying but he will eat the Al and when he rips with the beak the blood flows he gets blood all over his head he gets blood all over his body amen but it shows he has been eating live food and I tell you we got a Living Word and when an eagle begins to eat on it all the life of that gets all over you [Applause] Hallelujah you got Lamb's blood on your clothes and you apply it and I'm going to say and we're going to we're going to take this to a spiritual turn for a moment cuz we're talking about the blood of Christ which is the Holy Ghost understand we don't have a vial of blood we we don't have a cup of his blood so how are you going to be how are you going to be cleansed by the blood well you see at Calvary when his blood flowed the the blood cell broke open releasing the life of God it came back on the day of Pentecost that the holy spirit so you know today when we say when I see the blood we're talking about when I see the Holy Ghost when I see the spirit Jesus God said I'll pass over you this is how the death angel will will pass over you cuz I see the spirit I see there the death of the Lamb has brought his life upon you and that's the sign amen that something died here and paid the penalty for your sin so you apply Lamb's blood on your clothes on your house on your body on your spirit and on your soul in fact you're God the one the world detests is the great Shepherd himself and you are the Sheep of his fold and the world hates you you are in Passover from the moment you get the Holy Ghost the blood applied with his three stripes upon your body three places your body your spirit your soul every bit of that the blood has to be applied that's in three places that is the Gateway into the body through the body through the body comes the the the senses the the gate the doors which is see taste smell feeling here that's how you contact this body through the gates of your senses the inner sense which is which is on the inside of that we is this human Spirit and the human spirit is the intellect so there's there is memory imagination reasoning conscience and affections and all of those are are Gates now into the spirit that's why you got to be careful what you feed on Amen you know and even with what what you look at with your eye that no evil thing before you this is why why we get rid of Television that's why many of you needs to it needs to really apply the token the blood to your internet amen why because you see from there I talked to a dear young girl the first one the first one now we we had evil spirits cast out before but this is the first one that was so demonstrative came up into the meeting and as I anointed her with oil she changed to a grotesque creature crouching down with the aest look on her face swinging her hands and saying I won't come out I won't come out tried to strike me I get just feel like brush of wind come by me but she could never touch me and that prayer line that demon was was cast out I talked to her the next day I said where did this come in you know this just seemed like a little innocent girl an innocent teenager raised up in a Christian home come from a good message Church you know that with with great preachers and she said it was not something I physically did it was things that I was looking at they came into the eye gate into the realm of the mind and now took over her until she was possessed oh she ate lunch just like everybody else she had breakfast while like everybody else she did things like another normal teenager but something was is on the inside of her controlling her that's why the blood has to be applied the Holy Spirit applied to what you look at what you listen to that's why you don't want to just go and listen to the gossip of unbelief because Spirits travel on words come on now and you you are you are we are right now in Passover from the moment you get the Holy Ghost you are in Passover the blood is applied with three stripes on your body your spirit and soul the Bible said they shall take the blood strike it on the two side post and the upper doorpost now so it must be applied to three places let's look at it 1 Thessalonians 5:23 and I pray God your whole Spirit soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ so here's how it's preserved blameless you get the blood on it now without the sign displayed on your door now what sign that the life of Jesus is applied to the body spirit and soul notice the Holy Ghost is the sign that God requires he he's not looking for your how great you speak in tongues and how often you speak in tongues and how much you dancing the floors not looking for you know uh giving your body to be burned or knowing all the mystery he looking for his life so the question comes is the Holy Ghost on your soul has it changed your nature you know you might have put it on your body and you danced down the aisle but did it get beyond the body into the SP Spirit real and cleanse your spirit did it go from there into the soul and put God's nature and seal you to the day of redemption you see the Holy Ghost is a sign that God requires is the Holy Ghost on your soul as it change your nature that's what we want it doesn't matter how much you prophesy and it was right how much you spoke in tongues and they were genuine how much you danced and it was really the spirit that moved on you or how much your dress is Holy and there is nothing anybody could say about the way you dress what he's looking for is the Holy Ghost now is it keeping your human Spirit under control some of you listen some of you don't haven't even had the Holy Ghost on your spirit on your human spirit it's not even got that far it it hadn't ever went past you know it got into your ear and you know maybe in your intellect a little bit but it didn't go any further you know is it keeping it under control what about your temper your affections your desires what are they set on does it keep you from fornication does it keep you from pornography does it keep you you know are your are your affections set on things above that's right that's what you want to ask you know are your affections where are my affections where where is my heart what are my treasures what is it that I desire you know is it upon your body I and I even ask you know does it even show in your dress is there a pull toward the world we've heard a lot about girls and how they're to dress and should be below the knees and not tight and not form fitting don't you know don't use your purse strap you know going down between your breast and and things like you know all kinds of things we've heard but but what about it you know e even even for the even for the boys you know I I'm I'm going to I'm I'm going to get into maybe what you think is a gray area but I want I want to just talk about it for a moment you know you see it a lot of times among our young people you know next thing you know there's a hoodie well that's nice for warmth and there's nothing wrong with wearing that for for for that reason but don't wear the thing to identify yourself with the hip-hop culture so that you can look cool and blend in with sin culture in every way look like a Christian you know there there's nothing wrong with man wearing jeans but for crying out loud don't don't wear skinny jeans men shouldn't look like sissies wearing necklaces and Perms come on you know again you know this this is all has the Holy Ghost been applied to your body is it showing a Holy Ghost taste I want to read you a scripture is from Jude chapter one because there's only one verse 23 and others save with fear pulling them out of the fire and you know if I would do anything even with this any sermon is is to save with fear listen judgment is coming all will will be there amen but what's pull them out of the fire hating what's now hating somebody read it with me hating even the Garment spotted by the flesh that's right or spotted by the carnal mind if apparel has been spotted tainted or defiled by the filthy designers and trends of this age hate it yes now I I know you want me to give you a list of dos and don'ts this is not a law this is something you need to let the Holy Spirit deal with you about if you love the world of the things of the world the love of the father is not in you that's right he should be the Principal theme of our talking our thinking our singing our walks the principal theme of our life if he's the principal theme of The Bible and the Bible's in us then he should be the Principal theme of everything we do or say or think should be Christ so you apply the Holy Ghost is it applied to your prayer life to your Bible reading you know don't don't forget the simple things get the Leon out of your life feeding on social media is not going to Rapture you am man addictive game and of killing and murdering and filthiness and you know where you can pretend to kill and rape and murder is Le get it out of your life it ain't it's filthiness you can't feed on the unclean things well I'm a lamb won't get out of the pig pin that's right you know what I I want to say this who you are in your private life is your real person that's it and if it doesn't produce holy thoughts it's leaven so you know the first part of this whole thing is get rid of the leaven in your life a candle go through everything make sure there's nothing nothing that is 11 you see we are seeing the flashing red lights of the sinist coming everywhere and it's not the time to get in line over here for a worldly bag of peanuts we say peanuts are good but they ain't worth missing the train and some of the things that you're talking about is just PE peanuts compared to a Rapture compared to being on the train and going to Glory it's just peanuts a lot of people come down the Altar and I'll don't have to give up my boyfriend I'll don't have to give up my girlfriend I'll have to give up my my this I I'll have to give up my smoking or my drinking or this or my partying or my friends peanuts compared to eternal life peanuts amen amen you've got to be willing to forsake all follow him with all your heart unreservedly everything get rid of the peanuts forget it don't get in line for peanuts well I tell you what I'm going to hang out with these old friends cuz I want them see the change in me why don't you go to church and bring them here and let them see a change in you that's I don't care what your distraction is any anything distracting you from getting lined up to get on the train for glorious peanuts what will your cute look do for you if you miss the train you'll be sitting there with your cute look and the train left what will your makeup do for you and you missed the train instead of makeup what a what about some Acts 2 and four that gives you a clean heart a clean Spirit and the clean look you know yeah you learned from the Egyptians what to do to look glamorous and look like them I ain't talking about looking like them I'm looking talking about looking like the place where we are from while we look strange and they look at us and we're weird and we're this you know you know that they think I don't really care what the Egyptians think when when I went to Israel here some years ago you know we were getting on the plane and I looked and there's all these funny people you know with their prayer deals and their prayer Shaws and their hats and their their habits and and and all of the stuff that they had and I looked at you know these I'm I'm riding to Israel with these they they're pretty strange looking people they had their you know and they they're Orthodox with their ringlets and whatever and and I I'm looking at them we're getting on the plane you know I get to Israel and when I get in Israel ain't none of them look strange they look like they belong there this way they this is what this is what they look like they they were dressed like the place they were from amen we have a citizenship of heaven we are to reflect [Applause] Heaven come on we're not to change to be like the world we are the representative heaven we dress like this because we are of heaven we live like this because we are of [Applause] Heaven go ahead and worship your cats if you want them I worship the lamb now you know so is brother Brandon said a little Acts 2 and four it washes you up you won't be made up the look glamorous in the eyes of the world Satan is the author of that kind of beauty Acts 2 and4 will put some cosmetic on you that Max Factor knows nothing about see their faces all live lit up but the glory of God is an eternal beauty that won't fade away it's a meek and quiet Spirit that's acceptable to the Lord ma Max Factor was one who you know learned how and invented makeup in these modern times you know because he took and first did it for onscreen people to make up under the lights and whatever but he he take took and began to make products so women could look glamorous all the time and so he said now it ain't pain and scissors that cut your hair that bothers you it's that spirit in you that makes you want to go get it that's what it is Max Factor could make all of it he wanted to and laid over there and if you was a Christian you'd never touch it I mean if you were baptized with the Holy Ghost and living where you ought to live and your pastor preached the truth and let you know about it you wouldn't even care a bit I'm thankful I preach to a church that most of them are like that I don't have to even speak about these things very often why because they're living such a life beyond that but I'm just telling you peanuts you don't have time for it we're to be eating the Passover with haste getting rid of the leaven in the first Exodus there was a physical display of the blood that a lamb without blemish died brother Bram tells us in the message token that he said but in this glorious place under this Covenant there is a difference between the blood and the life so we don't have a physical paint we have the life that was in the blood the token for the believer today is the Holy Ghost not a blood of chemistry but it is the holy spirit of God that is the token that God requires of the church today God must see this token he must see it in every one of us so God must see the Holy Ghost today even as he had to see the blood in that day he must see the blood for the death angel to pass you know why because the evening Shadows are appearing the Wrath is about ready to be poured out from on high upon ungodly Nations you know upon ungodly Believers upon professors without a possession you see and and so you know we are living with the shadows and the Wrath is ready to strike and God In This Moment is requiring a token that you yourself have received his token the Holy Ghost and it's the only way and the only sign that God will ever pass because it is a literal life of Jesus Christ returned back to the believer God's life his Spirit his literal life must be on display on your job at school at home yes listen if it doesn't live at home it ain't worth nothing Christianity has to display its token publicly in your public life at at your office on the street with troubles around in the church and of course most definitely at home you know the blood is the token and the token must be applied you know because without it the coven is not in effect This Promise of a Rapture has no meaning to you this promise to escape the tribulation is not even applicable to you without the token you can talk about it say well I'll tell you what I can't wait for the Lord to come I've seen him do it oh brother Tim I as he draws on his cigarette and he's lit one off of that one smokes another said I'm convinced of my salvation I know I believed on the Lord Jesus Christ and and I am a Christian I know right now you know if if the trumpet would sound I'm ready to go as he drew on his cigarette but no matter how much you say you believed how much without the token without the Holy Ghost it's all for nothing now you're when you receive the Holy Spirit you're absolutely so different from anything thing the world ever saw you know you're you're a creature of a new creation with a new identity are you with me amen Jesus was the first of this new creation and he was so different from the rest of the world hated him religious people hated him everything hated him crucified him is that right yes amen but with with his death he brought forth many brethren and on the day of Pentecost I'll tell you what that's when the that's when Satan went into a nervous panic when he saw not just one Jesus but 120 born of the same spirit that was out the same species come out of the upper room speaking in Heavenly languages oh yeah come on impowered by the Holy Ghost are you with me amen and what was that that was the first of a new race and everyone that is born of that is a brand new species you are not of the old creation you are of the new [Applause] creation put up put up Galatians 2:20 I want you to see this and let me just paraphrase it as we do the old man is dead yes yet I'm living and again it's not me but Christ is living in me and the life that I live by the flesh that I live by the In the Flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God so look what he says the life I now live that old life is dead I'm crucified with Christ we're going to we're going to dwell on that for a moment crucified with Christ now so you see here he says I it's not me anymore but it's Christ Living in me it's the identified token that God requires you know that identified that we're identified with our sacrifice the life of Jesus Christ Our Savior so it's a Holy Ghost is our identification it identifies our our us as Christians now it's not our membership in church you can belong you can go belong to this church all you want to that's right going into a a barn don't make you a horse coming to a church does not make you a Christian right so I would like to get get them in church I I really don't want them in church I want them in Christ now I do believe that church ought to be a gateway to to show them Christ where they can get in the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost I get that but really I'm not wanting members what we want to see is bonafied Born Again Sons and Daughters of God Blood Washed Church who knows who they are who lives by faith the what faith God's faith a living faith because a living Christ is on the inside of them it's not how much you know about the author it's how much is the author living in you you reckon yourself dead and the token is what lives in you it's not your life it's him so we're in a cycle of time a new cycle of time I'll explain yourself him well it's the time of the Holy Ghost it's the time that the literal life of Jesus Christ must be there am well hasn't that always been the case no in the type that were different aspects of the whole process now you bear with me just for a moment the first step a firstborn lamb without blemish was to be chosen and kept up from the 10th day of the month Abid until the 14th day of the month so now from the 14th or the from the 10th to the 14th that would that would be the the first lamb the firstborn lamb without blemish was chosen and kept up examine made sure he was without blemish cuz he's got to be an acceptable lamb now that was Luther's day what a great message you know there there was five days of celebrating the lamb we we have found the lamb the one that die in our place he's without blemish and and we're not without blemish but our lamb is without blemish now remember again let me just go over it I want you to get it they looked for a lamb without blemish not a worshipper without blemish and when the lamb was brought before the priest for the sacrifice never was it that he would look at the worshipper and say is he without blemish is there in him is his nose crooked does one finger Bend out is he crippled is he lame is he halt is he blind you see it had to be an acceptable sacrifice but he wasn't looking at the worshipper than he was looking at the lamb and that's the way it is with you we're not looking at you the worshipper you're a sinner that's what you were a sinner you did wrong you were you were blemished that's right you were damaged goods you are awful you had sinned you were worthy of death but what happens when you take the lamb without blemish you place your hands on the lamb and what happen it transfers your sins to the lamb and the lamb dies for your sins that's all we're trying to get you to do is to recognize that your lamb is without blemish and lay your hands on the lamb and transform transfer your sins on the lamb now the problem with that blood is that the Lamb's righteousness or without blemish could not pass back on the worshipper but in this Covenant it is different in this lamb when you lay your hands on Jesus Christ and accept his dying and death in your place it transfers your sins onto him and his righteousness Onto You Yes hallu Hallelujah so that you become the righteousness of Jesus [Applause] Christ now that won't make you want to speak in tongues I don't know what would I could I could speak in tongues in every language right now over that so therefore you see from the 10th to the 14th was when this lamb was taken a 10th day the lamb chosen 11th day they celebrated the lamb oh he was a perfect savior he went to the Cross he paid the price look what he did 12th Day celebrating the lamb 13th Day celebrating the lamb but at evening time on the 14th day of the month the lamb is slain and it's blood applied get this watch the type the blood the token has to be applied in the evening time it is no longer just talking about the worthy lamb what he did at Calvary how he died on the cross you hear him preaching today it's the cross it's the cross sure it's the cross sure sure he was a righteous lamb you know all of that is true but if that's as far as you go the death angel still gets you to have your lamb kept up is not going to save you from the death angel the blood has to be on display that's right now brother bam tells us the token never came into existence until the evening time and this is the evening time of the age we live in this evening time for the church this is the evening time for me it's the evening time of my message I'm dying I'm going I'm moving out in the evening time of the Gospel we've been to up come up through justification and so forth but this is the time the token must be applied so now the message changes it's no longer just about celebrating the chosen sacrific the cross and how he died for me but the evening time message is to apply the token the Lamb's blood must be applied the blood's been applied the token of life that was in the blood is upon you and you're safe from wrath see the hour is here with the token himself is identifying himself right Among Us and proving he's the same Jesus yesterday today and forever and he's right with the word and it's got to be applied and a man that says he's got the token deny this word and what about it you can't do it the token has got to be there and when the blood was shed the token was sent down on the day of Pentecost it were like a rushing Mighty Wind now that was the theme of every Apostle amen have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe that should be the theme of the bride of Christ have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe you believe the message but have you receiv received the Holy Ghost since that's have you you know repent every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin for it's a token that you pass from death into life when you receive the gift of the Holy Ghost is an hour the token must be displayed so does the message live that's the question is the Holy Ghost being applied there must be the dying of the Lamb I'm going to get this part if I don't get any other there must be the dying of the lamb but how different was that for with us this is much different today then the lamb died blood was applied but with us the old man has to die with our sacrifice understand Galatians 2:20 put it back up again I am crucified with Christ so it's not just the lamb dying but you are dying with your lamb I'm talking about your own man judgment has to come on it amen Jesus spoke of the brass serpent let's just take that type for a minute John 3:14 watch this Moses lifted up he's talking to Nicodemus about you must be born again as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness John 3:14 and even so the son of man must be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life a't that strange put that first verse up ver 14 again Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so the son of man must be lifted up is't that strange that Jesus would liken his death his dying his offering to a serpent a snake why would he liken himself to the serpent that Moses lifted up for all to see as an atonement how in the world could Jesus be represented by a serpent notice the serpent represented sin and it being made of brass represented judgment so when lifting up the serpent it was showing sin has been judged yes now remember them in the wilderness they had been bitten of the serpent they had been bitten of sin and they had sinned against God and had was Dy a snake bite and the antidote was that to lift up a serpent a Brazen brass serpent showing their sin had been judged and anyone who would look on that would live amen somebody with me now Jesus was not sin we know that he was not sinful but he became our sin the Bible said he became our sins that we might become the righteousness of God in Christ so you see the the sacrificing of the lamb as the worshiper laid his hands upon transferred the wor worshippers sins on the lamb and died in his place the serpent was dead there was no life in it notice I want you to notice it was a crystallized Brazen serpent no life couldn't move couldn't breathe he was dead no life amen somebody with me amen when Jesus Jesus died and and there when he died let me just say it he died so dead everything said he was dead no life in him he died completely totally completely for you that when we put our hands on him by faith we transfer our sins to him and yes it's awful but let me tell you Jesus took our sins to hell and when he did he paid it all Hallelujah every sin ever ever sin of pornography fornication adultery drinking smoking whatever it is he took it to hell he paid the penalty are you with me but that's not all when we truly believe on him he not only takes our sins to hell but our own life our old sinful man is crucified with him and not only did he himself go to hell but he took you to hell with him every SE Gene of God come on with me get with me for a minute ever see G of God you were in him when he went to hell no Hallelujah think about it that's why hell is not for you you have already been to Hell you have already conquered it you already raised up on it and that's why hell has no hold on you now Hallelujah so when we truly believe on him he not only takes our sins to hell but our old life our old sinful man is crucified with him and not only did he go to hell but he took you with him now go all the way back to Abel and the first offering of sacrifice Abel died on his altar with his lamb is that right and in order for you to B be born again you have to die on The Altar with your sacrifice you got to become just as dead as he was and you're born again the serpent had no life in and you have no life in you for you are dead and the and the Bible said and your life is hid in Christ through God so you cannot keep your Same Spirit you see this this is this is the problem you say what but brother Tim I've asked God for the Holy Ghost he's not going to come and give you the Holy Ghost as long as you got sin nature still living in you him listen you cannot have two Thrones on your or two two kings on your throne he will not sit there and and coign with Satan in your life and you were born with sin nature as the king of your life and that sin nature has to die and a new king come this is why people don't get born again it all goes back to repentance listen it would make God a liar if you repented and was baptized and in his name and didn't get the Holy Ghost it would make God a liar well I I tell you I asked God and I've asked God nothing's wrong with God nothing's wrong with the formulary it's the Divine vaccine it's Eternal prescription nothing's wrong with the medicine don't go and adjust it go back and look and see if you took it right there's directions on the Battle of Salvation that starts with repentance and repentance is dying from your sins come on now it's turning away you can't keep your same thoughts you got to die you got to die like he died you got to die on The Altar like Abel did with his lamb you got to die with your lamb you got to die to your thinking to be born to his thinking so that the mind of Christ can be in you you got to think God's thoughts how can you think his thoughts and deny his word how can you claim you're born again if you're born again you got his thoughts you got the mind of Christ in you you're a new creature you're new species amen amen the word creature in the Greek has translated a new creation If any man be in Christ he's a new creature he's of a new creation old things are passed away All Things become new now so think of that go back for a moment make sure I covered this repentance nothing wrong with what God said something wrong with your repentance oh God oh God I'll serve you can I just can I you know but but but well kind of like this girl you know going to serve Christ she's interested in a boy in my church so she found out you know I I I I I I want this boy so she gathered all her makeup and all her pants and all her stuff and went and put it in a plastic bag went out and buried it got rid of it all buried it to one his boy well when the boy didn't work up work out she went back and dug up her pants and her makeup and everything else all these Treasures I'll serve you Lord but I I'm not going to give up my girlfriend I I I'm not going to give up this elicit relation I I love her too much well okay you love her more than you love God I well I I'll serve you God but I I'm I'm going to wear my makeup well he not going to give you the Holy Ghost you say well I got the token brother Tim yeah but you got paint that you try to paint over that token and he ain't there see the new birth makes you a new creature of a new creation by the spirit your own thoughts are dead they're so dead they're crystallized like the brass serpent like he died when the heavens and earth and everything witnessed he was dead Jesus died so dead that even his blood and his water separated his body his death was so tremendous till the world had a nervous breakdown the Earth Shook and trembled till rocks fell out of out of the mountains who else could die like that never happened when the pope died that never happened when a a past dies that didn't happen come on when a movie star dies that didn't happen but when God died in the flesh on the cross of the Earth had a nervous breakdown to know the very spoken word of God the Rocks the Rocks the dirt the sticks the clubs the trees on the Earth the Sun turns dark the moon refused to shine why they were products of his spoken word and with they saw their creator poured out sin poured out upon him and as life would leave him and the wrath of God poured out upon him till the sun shut off off its light the moon refused to shine the Earth had a nervous breakdown would have bursted to pieces if there hadn't been a future for us and if his elements of the Earth was so shaken what it ought to do to you and me what ought to do to our soul when we look and we see what God did for me amen it was all for you it was all for me what did it ought to do to us it ought to shake sin all out of our Lives desires of the world totally gone come on now amen how could you continue in sin don't you see what your sin did to him it was your sins that nailed him to the tree amen your sins killed him that's they couldn't have take his life he took the penalty of sin that we might become his righteousness and when the righteousness of God comes to us then sin is dead as midnight it's dead in our mortal beings you know it doesn't matter go back and look and see The Rebirth of a seed to see the birth of a seed what happens it has to die first so how are you going to escape it you got to die first you got to die what die to everything your pride your desires your ambition your thoughts so that you can be born again if you don't die you'll never live again now that doesn't mean don't you know turn a new page but actually die you know he not going to do it I'm going to do better I I don't want you to do better do better is still be the same dirty rotten sinner with a little bit of reformation that ain't going to get you nowhere amen we're not asking you to do better we're asking that the old man die sin is dead as midnight your desires you're Ambitions what you wanted the what you thought was smart and the way you thought was cute all of your thoughts dead and youd rise with Christ become a new creature with a new thinking a new attitude well you got to feel so guilty I feel guilty brother Tim for my sins I'm so ashamed well that's good you got to feel so guilty till when you stand in his presence it killed you you got to reconize yourself so guilty in God's present until the worldly life dies right there and the sin question is totally over so for his token life to come in you you've got to die to your sin in order to be born again that's why it's so short today people aren't willing to die you got to be willing to die so you see again for this token life to come in you your Nature has to change now H how how can you see ladies or you ladies let let me talk to you just a minute you know I'm not much of a Facebook guy if you if you contact me and you send a message please don't use Facebook I may it may be weeks before I find it better not be urgent cuz I won't know it but that but that's okay you know if you want to check in on your grandma every day or your friends your family it's got a purpose but how tell me how in God's name how can you ladies see young girls even girls from this church or who have been to this church stripped off with incent clothes on and painted up like a barn and on social media before the world say you're so beautiful you look so good in that you're so cute in that outfit shame on you that's all I say shame on you for complimenting sin complimenting sinful Behavior shame on you amen you you remember when Elijah challenged baale you remember that there was no answer to the to the gods of Baal or to the priest of Baal to their God there was no answer you see you see when the god of Elijah consumed the sacrifice are you with me and when you just accept a Creed it can be a message Creed or a form of baptism or you might have emotions where you get up shivering speaking in tongues and running all over the floor you get up weeping he but if that offering has been received by God and consumed and the world is dead to you your old life is dead and gone and where we recognize reckon ourselves dead and buried with him in baptism that's what baptism is for it is a sign it is a proclamation it is a testament that the old man is dead rotten and we're burying him that old s life is going under the watery grave but thanks be to God we don't leave them there we raise them up to walk in the newness of Life the Bible said in Colossians 3:3 you are dead and your life is hid with Christ and God Romans 6 And1 what shall we say shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound that's disgrace that's what happens we turn the grace of God into lasciviousness or licens to sin God don't care what I do so when you turn the grace of God into lasciviousness that's that's a license to sin that's what the Bible's talking about you take God's favor and use it for license well God loves me yeah he does but the Rich Young Ruler he loved him and he went to hell I tell you what God loved you so much he provided a lamb but you can decide I don't want Lamb's blood you see I I I I don't want the the the Society of Egyptian to see that stinky blood on my door I don't want to live like that I don't want to life like that I don't want to dress like that I I I I'm I we're of the high society we're a better class Death Angel comes we're talking about salvation from the death angel listen church if the Holy Ghost is applied to marriage you're going to have a wonderful marriage if the Holy Ghost is applied to your children you're going to raise wonderful children if it's applied to your home you're going to see the fruits of it are you with me amen there's going to be things happen but watch now shall we what shall we say that shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound and he says a resounding God forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein know you not that so many of us were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death this is the whole symbology of the whole thing therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we should walk in the newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that are old of man say it with me old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might need to be destroyed that from now on hence forth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freed from sin and that was his whole point of the whole thing he said is a woman as long as her husband is living she'd be married to another man she she is an adulterous she's under the law of that husband so you had your first husband which was sin and you cannot be married to Christ cuz and I live with that old husband he's got to be dead and once he's dead you're free from that law and you're free to be married to another man this is the whole thing that he's talking about and teaching right here in order for you to be married to Christ the old man's got to be dead if you're going to come in Union with him the old life's got to be [Applause] past our souls are placed upon the brass altar of his Divine judgment what was the penalty when you lay yourself on the altar of God which is pronounced death upon the sinner how can you rise from their alive and sin if God's accepted the sacrifice you die you're consumed and you're as petrified as that brass Serpent and just like the brass serpent there's no more left to you but just this form you're standing here you're just like Christ when they took him cold and dead off the cross you're dead why because you're on God's altar of judgment that that's what the altar is for it's an altar of judgment to judge your sins take them and and there bring them there and the sacrifice received by fire and the smoke goes up and you rise with your sacrifice into the heavenlies and you're sealed away from the things of the world then what happens after you have died you're conceived a new he don't leave you dead you you're conceived a new and you were first conceived in iniquity and now you're conceived in the something new The Living Word and what does that mean you're are a new creature in a new creation for the old creation is passed away and All Things become new what is it the word becomes alive in you then and when you once couldn't see the things of God now you do amen and there that makes all the scriptures D tail together that makes all scriptures agree and and now you're dead to the old creature and the creation with all your old thoughts your desires dead and you conceived a new and wash by the washing of the water of the word so when you're conceived a new you're born like you when you were born of your Earthly parents in your first birth you had their nature natur but now that you're born again you have God's nature look back up here Galatians 2:20 and let's focus on this because now your new nature is to believe faith is your nature faith is your life Galatians 2:20 I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life that I not live in the flesh I live by what the faith of the Son of God therefore I can believe for things I previously couldn't believe for because why the life I'm now living I once was this I once was dead but now I'm alive and because that I'm called to be his bride because everyone with the Holy Ghost has is a part of the bride of Christ so you say then your nature is to believe faith is your nature faith is your life then how can you say days of Miracles are passed when God is your father and if God is your father you're born in the family of God you seek those things that pertain to God you're God's child you're go you're you're nature is is God's nature and then when you hear somebody say well our church don't believe uh that we we the days of Miracles are passed well how could you believe the days of Miracles are passed when God is in you how could you say deny any of the word that's what I'm asking you know a lot of times people think oh brother Tim you're all about gifts and and miracles and signs and what I just say We Believe the full word of God you can't deny none of [Applause] it amen your life is a miracle your new birth is a miracle your nature is a miracle so how then could you say Miracles are pass it only happened in brother bram's time that was just for the Divine Healing movement you know it is if you're of the old creation it never was for you but if you're of the new creation then all the word of God is yours every promise for the bride is mine every chapter every verse every line amen and you say well brother d i I believe the message and still sending well you're deceived it can't display nothing but the token the token must be on this play Let The Musicians come now this is a very serious hour very serious

efforts today if you know in whom you have believed if you have experienced his holy spirit sure doubters will come the accuser of the brother lays everywhere to accuse you of the slightest thing always pointing fingers always pointing out your your your your human failures and flaws but if you're a real Christian the moment something wrong come you just take it and plunge it under the blood and say Lord forgive me brother Brandon would pray Lord forgive me of my sins he wasn't out drinking and smoking and committing adultery and you know his life but every one of us grapple unbelief comes and hits us every way storms hit our lives and sometimes even we the strongest of us flustrated and doubt like I said when you're filled with the Holy Ghost you're filled with Divine love so well I I don't that brother hurt me brother timy wounded me so bad I I I don't know if I have that Divine love maybe you hadn't been able to release it yet but it's there it's there you know you know
