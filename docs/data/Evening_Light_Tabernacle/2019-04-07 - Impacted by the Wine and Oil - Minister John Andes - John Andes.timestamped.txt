[19:57] [Music]
[20:23] Heavenly Father that is so true God
[20:25] tonight we've come at it as an assembly
[20:28] to just offer our lives up for these
[20:32] coming days now we believe in
[20:36] preparation Lord for victory and what
[20:39] lies ahead of us is a mission filled
[20:42] with our young people that we're
[20:45] instructed by your prophet to lay up and
[20:48] store for our children for those around
[20:52] us Lord and those you've invited Lord to
[20:56] come and be part of this great feast
[20:58] this love feast Lord would you come
[21:01] tonight and strengthen us on the Sunday
[21:03] night it's unusual there would be a
[21:08] Sunday night service like this and but
[21:11] we've dedicated it for the Assembly for
[21:14] the young people and the workers looking
[21:16] forward to Easter camp pray that you
[21:19] would speak things to prepare our hearts
[21:21] and Lord we believe we are part of a
[21:24] great field Lord you're bringing forth
[21:26] fruit climax our lives by the Holy Ghost
[21:32] Lord Jesus may you give us strength
[21:35] tonight and throughout the day as some
[21:38] of tarried and stayed over I pray that
[21:40] you prosper them and give them
[21:43] inspiration Lord and may they go home
[21:45] tonight saying it was good it was worth
[21:47] it
[21:48] to be in the house of God
[21:50] strengthen the assembly Jesus name Amen
[21:54] amen let's turn to the scripture and
[21:58] Luke chapter 10 I'm gonna go right to
[22:01] the word Luke chapter 10 and then we'll
[22:03] just read a quote after you have your
[22:06] seats just for a moment but Luke chapter
[22:09] 10 verse 29 this is kind of a pre camp
[22:12] service is that okay and this is a
[22:16] preparation for us young people older
[22:18] ones and so it's good for us to prepare
[22:21] you actually get more out of something
[22:24] when you prepare so it's not just the
[22:26] you know Tuesday night before Wednesday
[22:29] night before throw in your sleeping bag
[22:30] in your toothbrush and your Bible saying
[22:33] we're going to camp no it said in
[22:35] yourself aside and preparing you'll find
[22:38] out that your fruit is greater the
[22:41] victories are greater and you get more
[22:44] from it so let's approach it as Luke
[22:47] chapter 10 verse 29 speaking about a man
[22:51] that came to Jesus and said who is my
[22:53] neighbor
[22:54] and Jesus answering said a certain man
[22:57] went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and
[23:00] fell among thieves which stripped him of
[23:03] his raiment and wounded him and departed
[23:08] leaving him half dead and by chance
[23:12] there came down a certain priest that
[23:14] way and when he saw him he passed by on
[23:17] the other side and likewise a Levite
[23:20] when he was at the place came and looked
[23:23] on him and passed by on the other side
[23:27] but a certain Samaritan as he journeyed
[23:30] came where he was and when he saw him he
[23:36] had compassion on him and went to him so
[23:41] he didn't just look at him and too busy
[23:44] didn't just look on the situation but
[23:47] his heart was moved into action and he
[23:51] bound up his wounds pouring in oil and
[23:55] wine and set him on his own beast and
[24:01] brought him to an inn
[24:03] and took care of him and on the morrow
[24:07] when he departed and took out two pence
[24:10] and gave them to the host he said unto
[24:12] him take care of him and whatsoever thou
[24:17] spendest more when I come again I will
[24:22] repay thee which now of these three
[24:25] thinkest thou was a neighbor unto him
[24:28] that fell among the thieves and he said
[24:31] he that show us mercy on him then said
[24:36] Jesus unto Him go and do thou likewise
[24:40] in other words you've seen oil and wine
[24:45] in a situation now it's time for you to
[24:49] go and do likewise god bless you can
[24:53] have your seats tonight and we speak
[24:59] I'll just give a little foundation for
[25:02] tonight service for a little bit we
[25:06] moved to Cloverdale when I was 16 years
[25:09] old with my mother and my two sisters
[25:11] and my father stayed in Jeffersonville
[25:14] working doing the editing of the
[25:19] messages of brother Branham because
[25:22] there was a burden for the children and
[25:25] the young people to be in a good church
[25:26] and as the years went by and we married
[25:29] and and had our first son and we moved
[25:32] back to Indiana to help my father had
[25:36] begun a little Church there then we a
[25:38] pastored in Tennessee for three years
[25:41] just as a young man and then went on to
[25:44] Arizona to help in a church there for
[25:47] three years and then in 2000 we moved
[25:49] back to Cloverdale all really for a
[25:52] reason for our family to be raised in a
[25:55] church that we had confidence in and
[25:58] that the Lord can minister to my
[26:00] children and my young people and to my
[26:03] wife and I it wasn't a ministry decision
[26:05] it was a decision for my family and I'll
[26:08] say after all these years 19-year years
[26:11] looking back and all three of my
[26:13] children being part of your East
[26:16] Camp and Labor's that goes into that
[26:19] camp and the young people and the
[26:21] ministry I can say tonight our families
[26:25] a product of those kind of meetings and
[26:28] I think you'd say the same that you saw
[26:31] oil and wine poured into the situation
[26:34] in your lives and that's why we are the
[26:38] way we are tonight is because somebody
[26:40] poured in wine and they pour it in oil
[26:45] when Satan wanted to rip us up and tear
[26:48] us apart and tonight we stand with all
[26:51] of our children serving God are their
[26:54] spouses serving the Lord we're now
[26:56] grandparents again if you can believe it
[26:58] and being back in Cloverdale we've
[27:01] helped our assembly with the young
[27:04] people and with the mini camps we have a
[27:06] summer camp that we have each year then
[27:10] we have a winter camp that is just for
[27:12] our young people alone and that's
[27:14] usually in February March and it's a
[27:16] winter camp because we have so many of
[27:20] our own young people we just dedicate
[27:22] that and brother Timothy Pruett is
[27:24] spoken at that before and other
[27:26] ministers of the gospel and we
[27:28] appreciate those times we've just gone
[27:30] through a winter camp at our church and
[27:32] over the years it's it's been a
[27:35] privilege of ours to work with the young
[27:37] people of the message and ministered
[27:39] either camps around the world and been
[27:42] part of families and situations as young
[27:45] people go through times like that so
[27:47] coming here this weekend it was a an
[27:51] opportunity possibly to speak from our
[27:54] hearts before your camp services and to
[27:58] just show the success of the Word of God
[28:00] and the wine and the oil that's poured
[28:04] into a situation and how young people
[28:07] when they have wine which you know from
[28:11] the third seal the Bible says hurt not
[28:13] the oil and the wine and the oil is the
[28:17] Holy Ghost a type of the Holy Ghost and
[28:20] wine a stimulation that comes from the
[28:23] word and so
[28:26] sensitive time of a person's life it's
[28:30] very important to have the right word
[28:32] and the right atmosphere to be poured in
[28:36] or it can be devastating for their
[28:38] future and tonight I want to speak a
[28:41] message and in just preparation with you
[28:43] for your Easter youth camp that has not
[28:47] become just a local meeting but it's
[28:50] become globally as I said this morning
[28:53] were young people and families and even
[28:56] pastors have the confidence to send
[28:59] their young people under your care
[29:01] because they've seen the atmosphere of
[29:05] oil and the Holy Ghost
[29:08] and the wine flows freely it's not cold
[29:14] and it's not the programs and it's not
[29:17] for the gangs and it's not for boy-girl
[29:19] things but it's for an atmosphere for
[29:23] there to be new bursts it's an
[29:26] atmosphere for your young people and
[29:29] then you invite other young people to
[29:32] come to be in your cabins and you have
[29:35] the Gator Patrol and you have the
[29:36] internet and the streaming you have the
[29:39] ministers it's you have the brothers and
[29:42] sisters of your church throwing in your
[29:44] efforts together and I want to say God
[29:47] bless you for that thank you for the 30
[29:50] plus years that you've given up your
[29:53] Easter weekend because you've invested
[29:57] into the souls of young people in the
[29:59] message and I'll say now for you on this
[30:03] side but on the other side there will be
[30:06] thousands of lives that will come to you
[30:09] and say thank you for giving of yourself
[30:12] like we read in the Bible about this man
[30:15] that had been stripped and wounded and
[30:18] felling among thieves there's young
[30:20] people that have come to these services
[30:22] that have been influenced by your
[30:25] sacrifices and if you look sister Aimee
[30:29] can you bring up our slides and go to
[30:31] the second slides up I'll just go to the
[30:36] second one and look in verse 33
[30:38] where the Samaritan had compassion so
[30:42] she saw the need but he was willing to
[30:45] do something about it then in verse 34
[30:48] he did what the Levite and what the
[30:51] priest did not do they saw the need they
[30:55] saw the situation but this man actually
[30:58] did something about and you have done
[31:03] something about it this man went to this
[31:07] person bound up their wounds poured in
[31:11] oil poured in wine set him up on his own
[31:16] Beast which in the Bible a beast is an
[31:19] anointing and brought him to an inn and
[31:23] brother Branham so many times said the
[31:25] inn is a type of the church he brought
[31:29] him into a place that he could be healed
[31:31] and took care of him I thank God for
[31:35] evening like Tabernacle that has been a
[31:38] place like a harbor for people that have
[31:41] come to over the years and it seems like
[31:44] this Easter youth camp is really an
[31:47] opportunity for you to really put
[31:50] yourself into action for the sake of
[31:52] many many that have experienced God
[31:56] because you provided oil and you've
[32:00] provided wine now brother Branham talked
[32:03] about something I like to read this
[32:05] quote with you out of what is that in
[32:08] your hand he said Moses had been a total
[32:11] failure and there may be men here this
[32:14] afternoon may be ministers that's been
[32:17] total failures maybe you've been as a
[32:21] housewife maybe you've been as a student
[32:23] at school and maybe you've been as a
[32:26] child to your parents whatever you have
[32:30] been let that be has-been and start from
[32:36] today amen whatever you have been let
[32:42] that be
[32:44] has been and start from today amen
[32:50] no matter what it is maybe you've been a
[32:53] failure as a Christian
[32:55] maybe you failed to go on with God if
[32:58] it's been taken note to what I'm going
[33:02] to say just in a few moments about this
[33:04] Moses failed down in Egypt when he was
[33:07] born to be a deliverer to bring the
[33:10] children of Israel out of Egypt why
[33:12] because he did it in himself he took it
[33:17] upon himself to do it
[33:19] and anytime you take things upon
[33:21] yourself and leave God out then you're
[33:25] going to be a failure like Moses was but
[33:29] can I say tonight when you surrender
[33:31] your life to Christ and God flows
[33:34] through your life it's gonna be a
[33:36] success even if your past has been a
[33:39] failure it's time for all of us to let
[33:42] our past be the husband and we literally
[33:47] need to turn from that and look in
[33:49] another direction and start moving
[33:51] forward now let's stop the approach like
[33:56] maybe some have on the Monday and
[33:58] Tuesday of camp and say oh god we got to
[34:00] go to camp we got to get ready it's time
[34:02] that we prepare ourselves that we look
[34:06] on the situation and then begin to move
[34:09] out as this man did in the scripture now
[34:14] but the Brenham said I'm going back to
[34:16] our opening scripture he said Jesus
[34:19] found a man one time in a parable was on
[34:22] his road from Jerusalem to Jericho it
[34:25] showed she was backsliding he was going
[34:28] from a high going down low he was
[34:31] backsliding and he met him on the road
[34:34] and an enemy had beaten him robbed him
[34:37] and left him half dead that was
[34:39] physically alive but spiritually dead so
[34:43] the priests and the Levites and so forth
[34:46] pass by him but the Good Samaritan as
[34:49] Jesus taught it came picked him up
[34:52] poured oil in and wine
[34:56] and took him to the end now would you
[34:58] agree tonight he had to have wine and
[35:00] oil himself to give it out would you
[35:05] agree with that I felt this afternoon to
[35:07] say something here tonight for whoever
[35:09] it's for I've noticed people over the
[35:12] years that that's like they always live
[35:14] on the edge spiritually they're always
[35:16] struggling with being justified and
[35:18] sanctified and do I have the Holy Ghost
[35:21] they're always struggling to do the
[35:23] minimum and it's time for for that to be
[35:26] the pass it's time now when God really
[35:29] firmly plants you with the real
[35:31] experience for you to say what can I do
[35:34] for God what does God want to do through
[35:41] my life and stop allowing your
[35:44] experience to say Oh God and what was me
[35:47] and I'm always living kind of you know
[35:49] on the edge and I always need every camp
[35:51] and every week like to feel like I need
[35:53] to repent and come back there has to be
[35:55] a ton spiritually that we really nail it
[35:58] down and say god I don't want that no
[36:01] more
[36:02] I want that experience where you can use
[36:05] me you can flow through as brother
[36:08] Timothy lettuce in that song take my
[36:10] hands Lord take my youth Lord take our
[36:14] family Lord in this case take our church
[36:18] God but it takes men and women of vision
[36:23] that are willing to stop thinking that
[36:26] you're just on the back side and realize
[36:29] you're on the front line
[36:31] God's called you for a purpose God saved
[36:34] you for a purpose he wants to feel you
[36:37] and use you companies ever felt this
[36:42] little in your life just like you are
[36:45] just so small how what can God do with
[36:49] me well our little in the hands of God
[36:54] can feed the multitude
[36:57] like the little boy in his lunch if he
[36:59] would have just kept his little loaves &
[37:01] Fishes and whatever that was and his day
[37:04] and went to school he probably would
[37:05] have ate it up and he just would have
[37:07] went on in school but that little boy in
[37:10] the hands of Jesus his little said mm
[37:15] and I wonder how many of us hold in our
[37:18] little complexes and our little lies
[37:21] when really if it was given to God fully
[37:24] how many hundreds and thousands it would
[37:28] bless I want to say tonight we have been
[37:32] impacted by the wine and oil now what
[37:36] are we gonna do about it we're not
[37:38] called to just sit on the Pew we're not
[37:41] called just to go up and down all the
[37:44] time and our spiritual lives isn't
[37:46] always on the mountain the fruit is
[37:51] growing in the valley so we're in the
[37:54] mountaintop I believe it's been said
[37:57] before you're either in a trial coming
[38:00] out of a trial or getting ready to go in
[38:03] a try but we need to stop wearing that
[38:06] on our faces and on our shoulders so
[38:08] much being a Christian is the greatest
[38:11] life there is I think it was David said
[38:14] I'd rather I'd rather live a day in my
[38:16] courts than a thousands with the wicked
[38:19] a thousand that's almost three years I'd
[38:23] rather live one day in the presence of
[38:26] God hello everyone
[38:29] 365 in about three years I'd rather be
[38:33] in God's presence for one day than to be
[38:36] with the wicked for three years and on
[38:39] one place I'm just paraphrasing but
[38:41] brother branham said you know Israel had
[38:43] their hind your parts every Church has
[38:46] their hunger parts every family has
[38:48] their hind parts every
[38:50] ministry has their kinder parts every
[38:54] sister every brother has their hunger
[38:56] parts but God didn't raise you up to
[39:00] just use your hind ur parts he has a
[39:03] gift in your life
[39:04] and the oil and the wine was for you to
[39:07] be used of God to move the body forward
[39:11] [Applause]
[39:12] so can evening light Tabernacle take
[39:16] this service tonight and approach this
[39:18] year differently than other years and
[39:21] say God you gave us wine and you gave us
[39:28] oil but we show our love to God by what
[39:33] we do for others I want you to use our
[39:36] lives this year greater than ever for to
[39:40] be sensitive and give wine and give oil
[39:44] to someone else
[39:45] now brother Branham talked about how
[39:47] this man poured in wine and oil and he
[39:49] said there's the place I want to get you
[39:51] to he taking him to the end and said to
[39:54] the caretaker take care of him he give
[39:58] him a couple of pennies or whatever it
[39:59] was to pay his way he said now if he
[40:02] needs any more just go ahead and take
[40:04] care of him I'll make it right when I
[40:07] come now you Shepherds brother branham
[40:11] said speaking to the ministry God gives
[40:14] you the spirit and the word to take care
[40:17] of these wounded ones that's been
[40:19] brought in if you need any more he'll
[40:23] take care of that when he comes so just
[40:26] feed those sheep how many want to be
[40:30] good tech caretakers God's giving you
[40:33] wine and giving you all it's not just
[40:35] for us to you know just have an
[40:37] excitement ourselves the Monday after
[40:39] camp same I wasn't those great meetings
[40:41] or man I'm so tired or oh my we got to
[40:44] go back now God brings us to these
[40:47] mountaintops and to these sacred sands
[40:50] he's even preaching this message tonight
[40:53] and maybe even a special speaker to let
[40:57] you know that we can come into these
[40:59] times and go through them and come on
[41:02] the other side
[41:03] God can use you greater than ever before
[41:06] you know I feel like I'm speaking like
[41:09] to the championship team in a locker
[41:11] room you say we've won so many times
[41:13] brother John we've went to camps and
[41:15] we've had meetings and we've had
[41:16] services and we've had this we're just
[41:18] going to go in but you know any winning
[41:20] coach isn't just always satisfied with
[41:23] how it's been it's like in our blood
[41:26] it's like in our services it's like in
[41:28] our singing it's like in our preaching
[41:30] it's like I believe there's more titles
[41:33] for us there's more souls to be saved if
[41:37] we're not careful we get in a rut and
[41:39] say oh wow we don't need to do that
[41:41] brother John we bring the wires we bring
[41:44] our sleeping bag we're going to another
[41:46] camp it's gonna be this way Thursday
[41:48] night it's going to be this way Friday
[41:50] Saturday on Saturday nights gonna be
[41:52] this and we're gonna have baptism sunny
[41:55] Maury we're all going to be tired and I
[41:57] hope nobody's throwing oranges and
[41:59] drinking coffee on Sunday morning like
[42:01] there was a few years ago and all all
[42:03] the things that have gone on and you
[42:04] remember is that true and it's like as
[42:08] time goes on we start weighing things oh
[42:11] that was a ten that was a five oh that's
[42:13] an eight well that was a dud or I'm
[42:18] tired or you know that certain preacher
[42:20] you know I don't really get much out of
[42:22] their ministry oh no here we go again
[42:25] it's that person sing in it and we need
[42:28] to move out of that mindset we need to
[42:33] move out of that way of thinking and we
[42:36] need to say God
[42:38] I've been impacted by the wine and oil
[42:42] I'm gonna come into the same God I'm
[42:45] gonna be more sensitive this year do you
[42:47] want to use us so rather than going in
[42:50] backslidden and away from God why don't
[42:53] we go into it with our hearts ready to
[42:56] go
[42:57] preparing our hearts I wrote something
[43:01] in my notes to say after this morning
[43:04] service sometimes God may choose to make
[43:09] your testimony public and to make it a
[43:14] great testimony and make it that's where
[43:17] you're almost embarrassed to say well a
[43:18] lot of people know he makes your
[43:21] testimony public but she may allow your
[43:26] private life to experience a lot of pain
[43:30] and a lot of suffering and a lot of
[43:34] turmoil I said that to help some of you
[43:38] to let you know God may use your
[43:42] sickness or your family trouble or a
[43:45] certain thing you're going through and
[43:47] and make it a great testimony and why do
[43:49] they call my name or why does it seem
[43:52] like this is happening to me my meat is
[43:54] so public do you remember
[43:56] brother Branham sometimes he would talk
[43:58] to people and talk to them about
[44:00] personal things in their lives I do have
[44:02] to say it so publicly it's like the
[44:05] whole world knows I've got this issue or
[44:08] you know you've got a problem with
[44:10] smoking or you've got breast cancer or
[44:12] you're nervous is that right and I see
[44:15] this thing it's like stop it stop being
[44:18] so public about my private life but
[44:21] little do we know God has brought your
[44:23] life to the public but many times we
[44:28] don't know in our private life there's a
[44:31] lot of pain there's a lot of suffering
[44:34] people do not know what people that have
[44:38] great testimonies endure in their
[44:41] private life some of you might think
[44:44] this is a very skim milk service it's
[44:46] actually much deeper than you think
[44:49] there's great testimonies and miracles
[44:52] and things that God has done but the
[44:55] Monday and the Tuesday and what God
[44:58] brings that man or that woman through a
[45:04] lot of suffering
[45:06] a lot of pain I have prayed with
[45:10] ministers wives and older sisters in
[45:13] their 50s and 60s wondering if they've
[45:16] got the Holy Ghost and wondering if they
[45:18] where they stand with God and it's like
[45:21] it's not a young people's issue it's
[45:24] across the board God could use a person
[45:27] mightily like Jonah and then he can use
[45:29] like Elijah mightily and then them go
[45:32] into such a depression where the Branham
[45:36] can be used to the thousands and
[45:38] ministered to the thousands and there
[45:40] and then go through a thing in his own
[45:42] private life and personal life make it
[45:45] so public and humiliate the man and I'm
[45:49] sure some of you've gone through that
[45:50] but I thank God for the wine and the oil
[45:54] let's go to revelations chapter 6 now
[45:57] verse five and six how many's been
[45:59] impacted by the wine and oil hallelujah
[46:06] we've all been thrown to the side or
[46:09] hurt over the years there's always no
[46:12] matter our lives are so like a fish bowl
[46:16] out there that it's like people say
[46:18] things they do things and they email
[46:21] things and text things they might make a
[46:23] website about you but it's time that we
[46:26] haven't enough character and enough
[46:28] something about ourselves
[46:31] where we just keep serving God anyway
[46:35] hallelujah whether we be young people or
[46:38] moms and dads it it's so easy to get
[46:41] weary in well-doing and and bear your
[46:43] cross so much to where someone else
[46:46] might say I don't even know how they're
[46:48] standing but you know it's God that
[46:51] keeps us standing it's because God gives
[46:54] us oil in the Book of Revelations
[46:57] chapter 6 verse 5 and when he had opened
[47:00] the third seal I heard the third beast
[47:03] say come and see and I beheld and lo a
[47:07] black horse and he that sat on him had a
[47:10] pair of balances in his hand and I heard
[47:12] a voice in the midst of the four beasts
[47:15] lion ox man and Eagle brother branham
[47:18] talked about this
[47:19] in the midst of the four beasts say a
[47:24] measure of wheat for a penny and three
[47:26] measures of barley for a penny brother
[47:30] branham stops and says see they were
[47:32] charging for the word they were charging
[47:36] for the word for the meal for the food
[47:40] that the people should have been getting
[47:43] they were charging for it do you know
[47:46] there's going to be young people come to
[47:48] this camp that come from different
[47:50] churches that don't have what you have
[47:54] and they might be a camper or even a
[47:59] counselor or someone that comes to the
[48:01] services their normal church life is
[48:05] imbalanced they're not balanced you feel
[48:10] come uncomfortable around them you you
[48:13] feel uneasy you'd say they got issues
[48:18] they got issues but do you know what we
[48:23] all had issues we all were hurt and it's
[48:28] gonna take an extra measure of grace to
[48:32] be staying focused and say God you
[48:35] provided for us through the year I come
[48:38] from a good church I have good ministry
[48:41] then that should be able to put
[48:43] something in you to give to others so we
[48:48] need to stop our laughing and joking are
[48:50] sane man they got issues man they're
[48:53] full of themselves and instead of just
[48:55] turning it around and saying god help me
[48:58] this year to have the right attitude if
[49:03] you go into it with wine and oil you
[49:06] have something to give you're able to
[49:09] bear along with someone you're able to
[49:10] understand I hope this is helping
[49:15] somebody in verse 6 we find a measure of
[49:18] wheat for penny
[49:19] three measures of barley for a penny
[49:21] colon or semicolon whatever that is
[49:25] and see thou hurt not the oil and wine
[49:32] that's a commandment you can take
[49:35] everything take their health their
[49:38] wealth but you can't take the oil Holy
[49:43] Ghost and you can't take the wine no
[49:46] matter how far a person gets down and
[49:48] low when they start hearing the word
[49:50] they're gonna respond some jump some
[49:54] scream some just sit there and cry I'm
[50:00] preparing you for camp some don't know
[50:03] what to do they look at one another and
[50:05] say how should I be responding to this
[50:09] some are jumping up and down summer
[50:11] running to the altar some are screaming
[50:14] and some are you know look at what's
[50:16] going on no it's time that we begin to
[50:18] understand it's a hospital people need
[50:22] help
[50:24] churches a hospital and what really
[50:27] turns you on another person it might not
[50:30] be ministering to their need wine and
[50:35] oil is for the need as the Bible says if
[50:39] you have no need of a physician than
[50:42] when a physician you might not need that
[50:43] physician but you get in a 9-1-1 crisis
[50:47] you need a doctor you need someone to be
[50:51] saying that say why over the last years
[50:55] has there been ministers talk about
[50:57] pornography when 20 years ago you would
[51:02] have had to look that up on google what
[51:03] does it even mean is that true why is he
[51:07] talking about the internet why is there
[51:09] certain ministers that talk about you
[51:12] know chatting and Instagram and Facebook
[51:14] and they just bring it right down to
[51:16] whatsapp and right down to music and all
[51:18] of that and it seems like other
[51:19] ministers just preach on them
[51:21] revelations and just keep us in the
[51:24] seals brother and just keep us on the
[51:25] Rainbows you know we like to go into
[51:27] those meetings like they're pumping I'm
[51:29] full of and then they leave it's just
[51:31] they're high but what I found out over
[51:34] the years if you don't have a ministry
[51:36] that works with the people where they're
[51:38] at and
[51:41] to the young people you find the young
[51:44] people go through these experiences and
[51:46] they become tip Brown stars brother
[51:49] branham set camp Brown stars that is
[51:52] when the campgrounds on their on brother
[51:54] their a man a man and then through the
[51:58] year they go right back to being duds no
[52:01] response won't do anything for God two
[52:04] months go by they're right back into
[52:06] their hole and you say where was their
[52:08] camp they were so on fire brother
[52:12] branham called him campground stars
[52:14] I call them revival surfers they're just
[52:18] looking for the next wave they're
[52:20] looking for the next revival on high man
[52:22] they're on they're on but when you go in
[52:24] the valley Slayer friends it's time that
[52:28] we mature to the place as believers that
[52:32] their seasons in our lives hallelujah
[52:37] we've been impacted by the wine and oil
[52:40] it's like God was saying you know what
[52:42] I've always got to have the oil and I've
[52:44] always got to have wine there let me
[52:48] take you to this next slide sister Amy's
[52:50] gonna help us here as we speak about the
[52:52] oil and the wine how many would agree
[52:57] that wine has come to you please pass
[53:02] the wine and I'm not talking about wine
[53:05] and alcohol I'm talking about
[53:06] stimulation that comes from real
[53:08] revelation we just came from our winter
[53:14] camp these are three photos of our
[53:16] campground brother Tim Pruitt the Lord
[53:19] willing we'll be there in a few weeks
[53:21] for the Timothy's been there for winter
[53:23] camp this is what it looks like in the
[53:25] wintertime why came to us oil has come
[53:33] to us right at the very time that we
[53:37] needed it God provided it but I want to
[53:42] say this this is really the heart of
[53:44] tonight's message if we've received wine
[53:47] and oil then we become responsible too
[53:50] an atmosphere for others we can't just
[53:54] be going through this ups and downs and
[53:56] campground stars and revival surfers
[53:59] with when God is saying no you're
[54:02] responsible to have it for somebody else
[54:05] remember the Levite didn't have time the
[54:08] the priest didn't have time it was a
[54:11] Samaritan that with compassion you know
[54:16] sometimes we're just too busy hello
[54:19] somebody where one thing about camp is
[54:23] we all slow down it's like we're there
[54:26] for a cause for a purpose God brings our
[54:29] focus down we are here for souls it's
[54:33] not the food it's the spiritual part
[54:37] it's not just holding a twig in between
[54:40] us and relationships I've heard people
[54:41] say the oh they just come to camp 4 to
[54:44] get a boyfriend or get a wife or I think
[54:46] that's nonsense that might be a fringe
[54:49] benefit and if it happens praise the
[54:51] Lord
[54:52] I'd rather them be at camp than in some
[54:54] honky-tonk can you say man you say you
[54:58] know our principal of our church school
[55:00] saw his wife sister Shelly at your camp
[55:04] so you were partially guilty of a good
[55:08] marriage and a brother and his wife
[55:10] that's given 10 years for our assembly
[55:13] and for our church school I'm looking at
[55:17] people that gave up your Easter Sunday's
[55:19] for that I know of preachers in the
[55:22] message that receive the Holy Ghost at
[55:25] these meetings would you say it's worth
[55:28] it is it worth it but how many times
[55:38] have you done it and then you just
[55:41] wonder you know I asked brother William
[55:46] last night Dexter about this brother
[55:48] William you might remember this how many
[55:51] times does the average human heart beat
[55:55] in a lifetime do you remember that
[55:58] brother William yes and you know what
[56:01] Williams said to me he said well
[56:04] beats more when I play soccer yeah
[56:09] that's nothing but the truth brother
[56:13] brother John's heart beats more when I'm
[56:15] on the treadmill and I'm running running
[56:17] it goes up to 140 Plus but do you know
[56:22] the average human heart in a lifetime
[56:24] how many times it beats I'm staying on
[56:27] my message the average person's heart
[56:31] beats 60 to 100 beats a minute over a
[56:35] hundred thousand times a year over
[56:41] thirty five million times a year thank
[56:44] you over 100,000 times a day over 35
[56:47] million times a year in 70 years 2.45
[56:51] billion look at that if you live longer
[56:53] up to 80 years 2.8 billion times that
[56:57] your heart beats now it's a sign of a
[57:01] heart condition I'm not giving you a
[57:03] science lesson I'm just letting you know
[57:05] God is concerned with your heart beating
[57:08] but it's a sign of a heart condition if
[57:11] the heart misses beats or beats too fast
[57:15] that's why it's important that we stay
[57:17] and beat with God's Word now I'm coming
[57:22] back to our preparation for Easter camp
[57:26] just because it's done it before
[57:30] does not take away from the importance
[57:33] that it must keep beating it's got to
[57:37] keep beating say but I beat before you
[57:40] say I've done this before I've done this
[57:42] a hundred thousand times a day I've done
[57:46] this 35 million times how many times do
[57:49] we need to have camp and why do we need
[57:51] Sunday school why do we need Wednesday
[57:53] why do we need Sunday why why why why
[57:56] here's the answer just because it
[58:00] happened before don't mean it needs to
[58:02] happen again I thought there'd be a
[58:05] better response than that that's why we
[58:08] have youth camp and I trust it goes on
[58:12] to the rapture cuz every day every year
[58:16] there's another generation rising up
[58:19] rising up and they deserve to meet the
[58:22] same God you did
[58:25] hallelujah say I've done that before
[58:27] brother Baxter I mean how many times is
[58:30] the Gator but you have to take our
[58:31] 4-wheelers how many times do we need to
[58:34] have this big meat and why why why we
[58:37] can get to a place that the older ones
[58:40] can say come on wait
[58:41] we've been 30-plus years without even an
[58:43] Easter service at our church why why why
[58:49] and if we're not careful we can make it
[58:51] a negative and send praise the Lord we
[58:56] have seven eight hundred people join us
[58:58] for Easter and now the world knows about
[59:02] it now it's become a standard around the
[59:05] world where they say Louisiana camp is a
[59:10] place where young people can meet with
[59:12] God it's not seminar style teaching it's
[59:17] not just talking about relationships
[59:19] we're not just dealing with money issues
[59:21] and things we're dealing with heart
[59:23] issues and I pray it keeps beating until
[59:27] the time of the rapture I'll say this
[59:30] because my older son went to the camp my
[59:33] middle son went to the camp my daughter
[59:35] went to this camp in fact excuse me
[59:40] brother Tim but the very year we
[59:43] couldn't afford for her to go your
[59:46] pastor paid the way and on Wednesday
[59:50] night after church brother James I was
[59:53] on the internet getting her ticket and
[59:55] her and my wife flew to Louisiana and
[59:58] that year the Lord dealt with her life
[1:00:12] now she's married and going on with God
[1:00:15] my older son is married has a son my
[1:00:19] middle son Michael that went brother
[1:00:21] Jeremy Shriner how do you say sang that
[1:00:25] song last Sunday of Wingard ran and
[1:00:28] remember that year of the skid and they
[1:00:31] had the presentation of the prodigal son
[1:00:33] and you remember how they and they ran
[1:00:36] and when God ran you know God runs to
[1:00:39] those hearts that will cry out to him
[1:00:42] people cry out for alcohol they cry out
[1:00:45] for drugs
[1:00:46] I pray there be more of a crying out for
[1:00:49] God I need you Jesus I need you Lord I'm
[1:00:56] willing to humble myself and don't you
[1:01:01] worry there's always scoffers and
[1:01:02] mockers
[1:01:03] there's always churches that send their
[1:01:06] young people and I remember one year
[1:01:08] excuse me I'm getting personal but I
[1:01:11] remember getting videos of one church
[1:01:13] that sent their young people to the camp
[1:01:16] and on the way home they stopped at a
[1:01:17] rest area and the Holy Ghost had so
[1:01:20] moved on they're young people they're
[1:01:22] going around and around the van right at
[1:01:24] a rest areas nighttime I remember the
[1:01:27] videos and they went back to their home
[1:01:34] church and the pastor threw a bunch of
[1:01:36] cold water on that it's never been the
[1:01:39] same at that church because they don't
[1:01:45] like the emotion they don't feel that it
[1:01:47] was real they don't want their young
[1:01:49] people to be a part of that atmosphere I
[1:01:51] say they need more of that atmosphere
[1:01:55] instead of pouring water on it I would
[1:01:57] have been pouring gasoline on it I would
[1:02:00] have been saying what can we do to
[1:02:05] oftentimes they're just trying to
[1:02:06] justify their backslidden States and
[1:02:09] their churches are cold and indifferent
[1:02:11] and they have young people come back
[1:02:13] home on fire garden they're just quick
[1:02:16] to say all that's just emotion they
[1:02:19] stand up and give a testimony and a few
[1:02:22] months later they're back into a city
[1:02:24] raishin worse than ever before I think
[1:02:26] there ought to be a change to that I
[1:02:28] think we need to feed that and encourage
[1:02:31] that and say what can we do for our
[1:02:33] families
[1:02:34] you have strong young people you have
[1:02:37] strong families you have strong families
[1:02:40] you have strong church but this year I'm
[1:02:43] challenging you we've received oil we've
[1:02:45] received wine but now God is holding us
[1:02:48] accountable to have that for someone
[1:02:52] else he put him up on his own beast and
[1:02:55] carried him to the end that means he had
[1:02:58] something to give out let me give you
[1:03:03] another illustration how many times does
[1:03:07] a farmer work his field they plant the
[1:03:12] field they weed the field they water the
[1:03:14] field they cultivate the field they
[1:03:16] fertilize it they harvest it then the
[1:03:18] rains come then they have a bunch of
[1:03:20] locusts come through then it rains too
[1:03:22] much of just their crop failure they all
[1:03:25] you know what they do the next year they
[1:03:27] plant again they weed again the water
[1:03:29] again they cultivate just because you
[1:03:32] have a bad winter you have you know it's
[1:03:34] not going good what is it it's the
[1:03:36] nature of the farmer and I want to say
[1:03:38] tonight God will keep working his field
[1:03:41] and I'm happy to be a laborer with him
[1:03:44] all you say this young person did that
[1:03:46] that young lady did you hear about
[1:03:48] what's going on with that young lady did
[1:03:50] you know what that young man it doesn't
[1:03:52] matter we just keep planting we just
[1:03:55] keep leading is this OK tonight I went
[1:04:02] back to the heart you know how many
[1:04:04] times does it beat it just keeps beating
[1:04:06] and you go through a trial and it gets
[1:04:09] to justice or William runs in soccer too
[1:04:12] it goes fast goes fast and then you just
[1:04:14] it's time for a rest or your heart needs
[1:04:16] to be a farmer you plants and waters
[1:04:20] then you have a big bunker crop and you
[1:04:22] just laid in store praise the Lord all
[1:04:25] glory be to God but in the time of peace
[1:04:29] we need to prepare for war say why are
[1:04:33] you talking like this brother John
[1:04:34] because God's raising up a generation
[1:04:37] there has some character that's why the
[1:04:41] older generation many times gets nervous
[1:04:43] and concerned because many of them went
[1:04:46] through the Great Depression or they
[1:04:48] went through times of hardship and the
[1:04:49] new generation has everything handed to
[1:04:52] them given to them many of them don't
[1:04:55] want to work and they want this and they
[1:04:57] expect their iPhone or their Android
[1:04:58] they expect clothes and shoes they
[1:05:00] expect there's everything's given to
[1:05:02] them you know given to them how much is
[1:05:04] the camp fee how much Oh we'll just pay
[1:05:06] it for you we want you to be at camp oh
[1:05:07] you can't afford it or maybe the pastor
[1:05:10] pay it or this and that it it gets to a
[1:05:12] place where we just everything just oh
[1:05:13] I'll take it easy well maybe it's good
[1:05:18] this year for them to pay their own way
[1:05:20] or if they paid the hundred and twenty
[1:05:22] dollars it would mean more time or maybe
[1:05:26] dad and mom ain't so abusive to me
[1:05:29] anyway I've heard that phrase my my
[1:05:32] parents are abusive our ministers are so
[1:05:34] hard on us mine and I've heard that by
[1:05:37] good good families a mother and father
[1:05:39] trying to help their family along and
[1:05:41] and their young people get older and
[1:05:43] they throw out my back in their face
[1:05:45] they're abusive to us when really they
[1:05:48] ought to be happy that God put the walls
[1:05:50] up and put the protection around them
[1:05:54] y'all know where I'm coming from and you
[1:05:56] have good ministry that's concerned
[1:05:58] about our living hallelujah we're
[1:06:05] preparing our hearts tonight
[1:06:06] for the season can we all take a deep
[1:06:10] breath it came up on my phone this
[1:06:13] afternoon thunderstorms in the area
[1:06:16] thunderstorms severe thunderstorm on
[1:06:19] that's incredible there's gonna be those
[1:06:23] times it just seems like it rains it
[1:06:27] pours and there's other times the Sun
[1:06:28] comes out but it's not all the time it's
[1:06:34] not always going to be like this say
[1:06:37] brother John it's just what you said why
[1:06:39] does my life have to be so public and
[1:06:41] why do I have to feel like it's just
[1:06:43] wrong out there well there will be
[1:06:45] another spring with a little bit of oil
[1:06:48] and a little bit of
[1:06:49] you're gonna heal you're gonna get
[1:06:52] stronger you're gonna wake up and
[1:06:55] realize life is worth living hallelujah
[1:07:00] serving Christ isn't always easy it's
[1:07:05] not always the easier road many times
[1:07:08] it's the harder road is that truth let
[1:07:14] me go to the next slide I was so
[1:07:15] challenged by this do you all see that
[1:07:22] turtle I'm taking you back to your youth
[1:07:25] banquet that brother John was streaming
[1:07:29] but the Danny spoke about this it's
[1:07:33] talking about the turtles and how I'm
[1:07:35] bringing this back to your memory to
[1:07:37] trigger something in your heart he gave
[1:07:40] an illustration and spoke about it in
[1:07:43] words I'm gonna give it to you visually
[1:07:45] in this illustration we see there's the
[1:07:49] lights of the city that these little
[1:07:51] turtles are being born in on the sand
[1:07:53] and because the lights of the city are
[1:07:55] so strong the turtles are being born and
[1:07:59] turning toward the lights of the city
[1:08:01] and they're finding them the next
[1:08:03] morning
[1:08:04] all along the streets and the sidewalks
[1:08:07] dead because the lights of the city was
[1:08:10] so strong I hope you're thinking
[1:08:14] spiritual that many of them died instead
[1:08:18] of going toward the ocean when the line
[1:08:21] of the moon should have been so strong
[1:08:23] how many knows the moon is a reflection
[1:08:26] of the church that should be reflecting
[1:08:29] the Sun so when haziness comes in the
[1:08:33] church and clouds come in the family and
[1:08:35] things begin to cover over the strength
[1:08:38] of the church the young people start to
[1:08:40] turn toward the world the lights of the
[1:08:44] city the lights of the world begins to
[1:08:46] pull so strongly brother Joe that it
[1:08:49] pulls them into death and watch this as
[1:08:52] we look on the screen they find them the
[1:08:55] next day on the streets of the city
[1:08:59] they've turning their eyes toward the
[1:09:02] lights
[1:09:03] of the city and here's a photo I won't
[1:09:06] keep it there long this is what happens
[1:09:07] to someone that lost their way say what
[1:09:10] happened to that young person how could
[1:09:12] they lose their way it's because the
[1:09:15] lights of the world was calling to them
[1:09:17] and they got out on a road and Satan
[1:09:21] destroyed them don't let this be your
[1:09:23] testimony it's time that the Bride of
[1:09:27] Christ realized that you are the light
[1:09:30] of the world and if the light loses its
[1:09:34] it's it's as pull then our young people
[1:09:37] being born in the message will turn
[1:09:40] toward the lights of the world and it
[1:09:42] has a pull on them and we find them on
[1:09:45] the streets of Laodicea they're squashed
[1:09:47] I say God send a Holy Ghost revival keep
[1:09:54] our family strong keep our church strong
[1:09:57] bring in ministries and bring in you
[1:10:01] know ministries are like doctors and if
[1:10:04] you have a special need it's not just
[1:10:06] many times a general doctor you need you
[1:10:09] need someone that's trained whether it's
[1:10:12] a heart specialist or a knee specialist
[1:10:14] sir
[1:10:14] your hip is out you don't just need a
[1:10:16] foot doctor you need a hip doctor
[1:10:18] they've done that before they've been
[1:10:21] there before sometimes it's not all
[1:10:29] general I'll just read your Bible and
[1:10:31] pray oh come on pull your pants up you
[1:10:35] understand the phrase let us get into
[1:10:38] the word sometimes it takes someone that
[1:10:40] can just say the right word it can be in
[1:10:43] the right season pour in oil pour in
[1:10:47] wine that person can be healed and
[1:10:50] strengthened and be a contribution to
[1:10:54] the body that's what we need to hear and
[1:10:57] the lights of the city now they're
[1:10:59] actually intimate because the resorts
[1:11:01] and the condos are coming so close to
[1:11:03] the ocean they're actually putting
[1:11:05] certain lighting you can see it here on
[1:11:07] the screen a before photo and then an
[1:11:09] after photo how they're even enforcing
[1:11:12] the laws to change the effect of the
[1:11:15] lighting so the turtles when
[1:11:16] born can go toward the habit I'll go to
[1:11:19] the ocean because there's a desire to
[1:11:22] see them live see them thrive that wish
[1:11:32] we had another service but the older
[1:11:35] generation wants to trust you they want
[1:11:38] to give you the baton they want to say
[1:11:41] go for it brother
[1:11:42] go for it sister they want to have
[1:11:45] confidence in you but they're there
[1:11:47] looking for the Christ for the character
[1:11:50] I think it's time to rise to the
[1:11:52] occasion
[1:11:52] like Joshua and Caleb they were willing
[1:11:55] to go forward into the new land
[1:11:59] hallelujah I trust this is good tonight
[1:12:02] to prepare your heart and this is the
[1:12:04] strength of the Moon and some of you
[1:12:06] might be standing on the shore maybe
[1:12:07] you're just at that valley of decision I
[1:12:10] hope this year God can really do a turn
[1:12:12] in your heart to realize what God's done
[1:12:15] for me I want to see it for someone else
[1:12:19] if God can give a solid strong families
[1:12:24] those families are to be dedicating
[1:12:27] themselves to the body and saying what
[1:12:30] can we do for somebody else and that
[1:12:34] excuse me but I'm gonna be real honest
[1:12:36] right here how many believe in the token
[1:12:40] that all you and your household shall be
[1:12:44] saved our children will be saved this
[1:12:47] promise is unto you and your children
[1:12:49] Rahab bring them in and they're going to
[1:12:52] be saved we preach that we apply that
[1:12:55] but the Birman said I I believe it for
[1:12:58] myself I believe it for my family and I
[1:13:00] believe it for all of you but never have
[1:13:04] we been in a generation like this where
[1:13:06] we have young people and families being
[1:13:08] raised in the message and in good
[1:13:10] families and in good churches where
[1:13:14] people making their choices of not to
[1:13:17] serve God and to go into the world oh
[1:13:20] you say you have so many adults now that
[1:13:23] are almost becoming stunned where did we
[1:13:25] go wrong or what should we have done and
[1:13:28] in fact it ought to be just the opposite
[1:13:30] it ought to be Lord you gave them to us
[1:13:33] we apply the token we commit them to you
[1:13:36] that's up to God to take care of that
[1:13:43] but many times God gives us strong
[1:13:45] families in the church but there's weak
[1:13:48] families in the church there's families
[1:13:51] that are broken and when Jesus said that
[1:13:54] can you bear with me for just a moment
[1:13:57] the poor you have with you always
[1:14:00] it's not just poor financially there are
[1:14:04] people that are poor in spirit poor in
[1:14:07] Revelation poor and in just mental
[1:14:11] capacities their health is poor and we
[1:14:16] will bear them right till the time of
[1:14:18] the change there will be men and women
[1:14:21] in the church that bear ye one another's
[1:14:24] burdens and instead of looking down on
[1:14:27] people and looking at one another's
[1:14:29] weakness we need to learn to block for
[1:14:32] one another and if somebody fumbles the
[1:14:34] ball we need to pick it up I'm preaching
[1:14:40] a pre-camp service there are those that
[1:14:45] no matter what you do
[1:14:46] pour it in have a great service they
[1:14:48] just continue to just go bad and worse
[1:14:51] and seem like they're going in the
[1:14:53] negative direction but you've got to let
[1:14:56] your face stay with Christ stay with the
[1:14:59] word I hope that helps somebody I
[1:15:04] believe God's preparing our hearts now
[1:15:07] for the seasons I believe there's some
[1:15:09] victories that's going to be a hit and
[1:15:11] it might not happen the way you're
[1:15:14] expecting in fact it might be just the
[1:15:19] opposite the way you think I've seen
[1:15:23] ministers in a service look so bored and
[1:15:26] looked like they're getting nothing
[1:15:28] nothing after it and there's someone
[1:15:30] else in the same service that is
[1:15:32] connecting and that's exactly what that
[1:15:34] person needed I've seen older ones you
[1:15:37] see you know they go to sleep they lose
[1:15:38] interest
[1:15:39] say where are they coming from and
[1:15:43] another person in that service say that
[1:15:46] was thus saith the Lord is it's like you
[1:15:48] were saying things that me and my wife
[1:15:50] was talking about last night or me and
[1:15:53] my children we just dealt with that
[1:15:54] yesterday
[1:15:58] I've personally dealt with it in the
[1:16:00] ministry and gotten a lot of grief and
[1:16:02] and coming back from elders only to get
[1:16:08] another response from another person and
[1:16:10] say that was exactly what I needed do
[1:16:13] you know what that I'd to do
[1:16:14] stop being so a person that so arose
[1:16:17] over and complex and you just take the
[1:16:21] blows and grow in Christ and keep
[1:16:24] pressing on it's time to come out of
[1:16:26] your caves
[1:16:31] I'll just be honest with you there's
[1:16:34] times that people just take a sabbatical
[1:16:36] it's like they're off for months for
[1:16:41] years you say they used to be right into
[1:16:46] it they what can I do now they just come
[1:16:48] to check they've lost a fire they've
[1:16:50] lost their desire they used to be on the
[1:16:52] edge of their seat they used to be so
[1:16:54] yes Lord yes Lord they come early now
[1:16:56] they're just so casual you can't hardly
[1:16:59] get them to move they hardly dare they
[1:17:01] miss the service and don't matter what
[1:17:03] happened we talked about people losing
[1:17:07] their mind in the world or going insane
[1:17:10] it can happen to a good person the
[1:17:16] pressures of life
[1:17:20] life goes on there's no mercy on any
[1:17:25] person white person black person Chinese
[1:17:29] person pink person good people bad
[1:17:33] people we all have pressure and as we
[1:17:37] get older or our health is failing we
[1:17:40] can get Moody brother branham talked
[1:17:43] about me may I pray God never crown my
[1:17:47] life to be a crab an old man I don't
[1:17:51] want to be crab it
[1:17:53] I don't want to be a person that it's
[1:17:55] never good enough it's never the music
[1:17:58] is never good enough the preachings
[1:18:00] never good enough there's always some
[1:18:01] weakness some problem god help us in
[1:18:06] that area I'll say like David I'd rather
[1:18:10] spend a day in the house of the Lord
[1:18:12] with people that love God and are going
[1:18:15] forward you know but you can get in the
[1:18:18] world and and there it's just not cool
[1:18:21] those young people are simple they're
[1:18:26] brainwash you're so funny and if we're
[1:18:30] not careful we can have people right in
[1:18:32] the church that live two lives when
[1:18:36] they're around the church people they're
[1:18:37] holy they're good they know how to be
[1:18:39] and then on the job in the school at the

[1:19:05] us dealings of the Holy Ghost that is
[1:19:08] God said God might not be talking to you
[1:19:15] the same but there might be another
[1:19:17] person God is walking right in their
[1:19:20] front door discerning everything about
[1:19:22] their lives and we need to bear their
[1:19:26] burdens by staying interested staying in
[1:19:30] prayer I'm admonishing you tonight I'm
[1:19:36] encouraging here this is now 30 40 years
[1:19:39] of brother John being raised in the
[1:19:41] message and going through camps and
[1:19:43] preaching three camp services and then
[1:19:46] the service after camp and and being
[1:19:48] able to understand how the Lord's
[1:19:50] dealing in our assembly now I'm bringing
[1:19:53] it to your church it's important that we
[1:19:56] learn to recognize the signs of God's
[1:19:59] dealings and seize those moments I think
[1:20:05] it's important to recognize
[1:20:07] these are precious times these are
[1:20:14] precious times you just talked to
[1:20:17] somebody that's in jail tonight and
[1:20:19] they'll tell you they wish they were
[1:20:21] free they wouldn't care about what kind
[1:20:25] of car they had to drive what kind of
[1:20:27] clothes like just get me out of these
[1:20:29] jail clothes
[1:20:30] I'm so embarrassed why I'm in here and
[1:20:35] they're in there for a year two years
[1:20:38] five years it's like how could I be so
[1:20:41] stupid how could I be so dumb drugs and
[1:20:44] alcohol and people steal stuff Satan
[1:20:46] gets him on a treadmill of life we need
[1:20:50] to learn to seize these moments and hold
[1:20:56] fast to Christ I've talked to young
[1:21:04] ladies I prayed with them I've talked to
[1:21:05] young men I was with a young man just a
[1:21:08] few days ago and even weeks ago and then
[1:21:11] we baptized him down in our Seattle
[1:21:13] church he had such a life that he
[1:21:15] couldn't cross the border and duis and
[1:21:17] all kinds of trouble and things and we
[1:21:19] baptized him and he gave his heart to
[1:21:22] the Lord he said pray for me I've got
[1:21:24] this appointment Tuesday I'm we prayed
[1:21:26] with him and God gave him grace before
[1:21:28] the judge I get I had a tech just a week
[1:21:31] ago and he said pray for me announce
[1:21:33] I've come time through and I have to
[1:21:35] stand before the judge I might have to
[1:21:36] go to jail I'm I'm expecting to go to
[1:21:39] jail because the the judge is a certain
[1:21:43] way and this is what's happening in the
[1:21:44] community and he was going he's been
[1:21:46] married since we baptized him to someone
[1:21:53] that was in our church and a family
[1:21:55] here's just he's out in the world and
[1:21:57] months ago we went to a home and spoke
[1:22:00] to him about baptism and we just kind of
[1:22:02] nurtured him as a young man just worldly
[1:22:06] person but he gave his heart to the Lord
[1:22:09] we baptized him and we've got to be
[1:22:12] willing to take baby steps with people
[1:22:14] and he texted me said pray for me I'm
[1:22:17] just expecting they could throw the book
[1:22:19] at me they could and we prayed with
[1:22:21] the Lord stood for him and the judge
[1:22:23] gave him mercy didn't even give him no
[1:22:26] time gave him probation you know what
[1:22:32] that does for a new Christian it breeze
[1:22:34] hoping to them it breeze faith into them
[1:22:37] oh you say brother John you're way out
[1:22:40] there we don't even deal with those
[1:22:41] things well God gave us a lot of wounded
[1:22:44] people people that were thrown aside
[1:22:46] people that were didn't have it all
[1:22:48] together hallelujah to restore them and
[1:22:52] speak to them in a way that I believe we
[1:22:55] are about right for a real revival of
[1:22:57] God I believe some of your families that
[1:23:00] the time is right for a real time that
[1:23:03] the word is calling to us to move on up
[1:23:05] just a little bit higher it's time for
[1:23:11] the turtles to start turning in the
[1:23:13] right direction that little illustration
[1:23:19] spoken to your young people at your
[1:23:22] right back in this fellowship hall
[1:23:24] brother John has take that it to at
[1:23:27] least six other churches and gatherings
[1:23:30] of people to show them that God is
[1:23:32] concerned about their birth about the
[1:23:35] direction in their life God doesn't want
[1:23:37] you out on the streets of some city just
[1:23:40] becoming pavement for the devil and I
[1:23:44] pray we would not just take these things
[1:23:46] as little stories little but take them
[1:23:48] to heart
[1:23:52] take this to heart tonight to prepare
[1:23:55] yourself and in closing tonight I want
[1:23:59] to say this I was listening to a message
[1:24:02] that was mentioned during our camp for
[1:24:04] our young people
[1:24:05] one of the brothers mentioned it and so
[1:24:07] after I just started listening to it
[1:24:09] listening to it
[1:24:10] what is that in thy hand brother Branham
[1:24:13] said at the beginning of the service he
[1:24:15] was thinking of the crippled people and
[1:24:17] the people in wheelchairs now they're in
[1:24:19] stretchers and carts and he said oh I
[1:24:21] see there's crutches laying under that
[1:24:25] man's chair just ask God that he'll let
[1:24:28] them walk out of here today without
[1:24:30] their support
[1:24:34] I thought isn't that wonderful cots and
[1:24:36] stretchers and and and and crutches it
[1:24:40] was the prayer of the ministry now this
[1:24:43] is oil in mine that they would walk out
[1:24:45] of there without that support I think
[1:24:49] that ought to be our attitude
[1:24:50] approaching things not what I can get
[1:24:53] out of it but what can the people get
[1:24:56] out of this do you know what happened at
[1:25:00] the end of that service brother branham
[1:25:02] started to talk about Shamgar and how
[1:25:04] God anointed him and he and the enemy
[1:25:07] was coming to take away his crop and he
[1:25:09] saw his wife and saw his children and
[1:25:11] the Philistines were taking a crop every
[1:25:13] year every summer they'd lay it up and
[1:25:15] then the enemy would come and his
[1:25:17] righteous indignation God all God up he
[1:25:19] said he said and that's what ought to
[1:25:23] happen to you here on these cots and
[1:25:25] stretchers and we come into eastern
[1:25:31] youth tent there's young people come in
[1:25:33] burden and troubled can you help me as I
[1:25:37] close the service they're not in
[1:25:38] physical wheelchairs that aren't in
[1:25:41] spirit
[1:25:41] you know stretchers and filling up the
[1:25:43] whole altar with cots and there's not a
[1:25:46] lot of people with crutches but
[1:25:50] spiritually Satan comes in through the
[1:25:54] year and he's nothing but a robber and a
[1:25:58] thief and he destroys and takes their
[1:26:01] joy and takes their passion and takes
[1:26:04] tries to steal their experience I think
[1:26:07] it's time that the ministry began to
[1:26:09] give freedom to be able to say I trust
[1:26:12] they walk out of here
[1:26:14] without that kind of support take your
[1:26:20] burdens to the Lord and leave it there
[1:26:22] say I'm gonna go in with these things
[1:26:25] and I'm gonna leave with them no God
[1:26:27] says no you leave them right here
[1:26:29] brother Branham said Shamgar got his
[1:26:31] riding just nicked indignation up and he
[1:26:34] said that's what ought to happen to
[1:26:35] these on the carts and stretchers just
[1:26:37] get a little mad at the devil forget
[1:26:40] about your nice hair and what people's
[1:26:43] gonna think about your clothes and well
[1:26:45] if I go up there
[1:26:46] think I'm back slid well friends the
[1:26:49] altar is more than just for black
[1:26:51] Cillian people it's for young people
[1:26:54] that want to get right with God and for
[1:26:57] those that say God I want to consecrate
[1:26:59] myself you know what do God that all the
[1:27:02] pews were gone all the chairs were gone

[1:33:27] heart we're so busy we got to get going
[1:33:32] we got other things know sometimes we
[1:33:34] need to listen stop talking just listen
[1:33:39] be like the Samaritan the Levite was too
[1:33:43] busy the priest was too busy and God's
[1:33:46] asking you exist you hear

[1:33:52] some wine be ready in Jesus name God
[1:33:57] bless you let's bow our heads together
[1:34:11] but it's preparing us trying to see
[1:34:17] those that are interested in the
[1:34:19] symphony who's interested he's looking
[1:34:23] out over the orchestra saying who's
[1:34:26] interested and you see the beat of the
[1:34:28] sheet music and it goes along for a
[1:34:30] certain time then there's a burst here
[1:34:32] and then the drums begin to play then
[1:34:34] God begins to call on this person over
[1:34:36] here because there's a drama in this
[1:34:39] great sympathy and God knows as the
[1:34:44] composer and it's time for a change and
[1:34:49] he's looking out over the orchestra the
[1:34:52] sympathy saying who's interested in the
[1:34:55] change who's willing to turn brother
[1:35:01] John I'm so used to going in this
[1:35:03] certain way I'm so used to playing my
[1:35:05] life in a certain way me and my husband
[1:35:08] me and my wife it's we and us and my
[1:35:11] brother John we're older up in years now
[1:35:13] we're just concerned about our health
[1:35:15] now and our grandchildren or something
[1:35:17] but God is asking you to get a much
[1:35:19] broader vision say my young person's
[1:35:24] gone to the world or they're getting
[1:35:26] cold on God why don't you begin to pray
[1:35:29] for other young people and other
[1:35:31] brothers and other children and start
[1:35:33] getting a bird and be a counselor can I
[1:35:35] sweep the floor can I come and pray
[1:35:41] [Music]
[1:35:45] can I come a little early and pray for
[1:35:48] that young lady she's struggling
[1:35:50] [Music]
[1:35:59] God forgive us if we've been guilty
[1:36:02] [Music]
[1:36:04] looking at the hind of parts of one
[1:36:06] another people fumbling around people
[1:36:11] making mistakes if we're not careful we
[1:36:13] start making fun of them and start
[1:36:17] singing people singing and trying to do
[1:36:19] their best and we're making fun we're
[1:36:21] laughing maybe there needs to be a
[1:36:26] change of heart saying God you've
[1:36:29] brought me into this body forgive me if
[1:36:32] I've been guilty of that Jesus
[1:36:34] I wonder tonight if you can lend your
[1:36:38] shoulder to the wheel and say Lord this
[1:36:43] Easter this camp that's coming up I want
[1:36:48] to be more sensitive
[1:36:49] [Music]
[1:36:54] God given us oil and wine but maybe
[1:36:59] there's somebody else that needs the
[1:37:00] same are you willing to be unselfish
[1:37:07] this year are you willing to go through
[1:37:14] this without any personal gain or glory
[1:37:17] or recognition and say brother John if
[1:37:24] no one even knows but I'm gonna make a
[1:37:31] contribution I'm gonna do something I'm
[1:37:35] gonna set myself aside in prayer I'm
[1:37:39] gonna give in a certain direction
[1:37:43] because remember the gift is getting out
[1:37:46] of the way
[1:37:50] are you willing to get out of the way it
[1:37:52] said Jesus use us this year greater than
[1:37:59] ever before use our church greater than
[1:38:04] the 32 years we have our hearts have
[1:38:08] beaten we've planted we've watered and
[1:38:11] sometimes we can stand and get weary and
[1:38:14] sometimes we can go through and say here
[1:38:17] we go again and we can coil up the wires
[1:38:22] and we can put gas in the engine and we
[1:38:24] can prepare our notes look down over the
[1:38:27] list okay it can just start getting
[1:38:30] mechanical we can just start going
[1:38:35] through the motions or we can say God
[1:38:39] put feeling back in again for us
[1:38:43] who would say Lord you've given me wine
[1:38:47] and oil I'm making myself available for
[1:38:51] somebody else would you slip up your
[1:38:53] hand to say Lord use these hands use
[1:38:57] this heart that beats under this hand
[1:38:59] use these feet strengthen us Lord as we
[1:39:03] come into this the Ministry the
[1:39:05] counselors the workers but as an
[1:39:09] assembly we approach it preparing
[1:39:12] ourselves we're about 10 days out 11
[1:39:17] days Lord were preparing ourselves for
[1:39:20] the oil and the wine
[1:39:22] Heavenly Father I know that I'm just a
[1:39:27] visitor here I'm not the pastor and I'm
[1:39:31] not the associate pastor the brothers
[1:39:33] that work week after week with the sheep
[1:39:37] and this assembly
[1:39:43] but we're still part of the team we're
[1:39:48] still part of the body of Christ
[1:39:51] and we've seen the years of success and
[1:39:53] fruits that have come from the labors
[1:39:56] now of what we're approaching in the
[1:39:58] next few days let us set ourselves aside
[1:40:05] don't let us be like robots and like
[1:40:08] people that have just done this before
[1:40:10] but let us be a people that's
[1:40:14] invigorated let the blood flow but the
[1:40:19] heart beat again let the seeds be
[1:40:21] planned to turn on the sprinklers Lord
[1:40:24] let there be showers of blessing pour
[1:40:29] out your spirit upon the musicians Lord
[1:40:32] that seniors and The Specials let the
[1:40:36] ministers Lord it be laid upon their
[1:40:38] hearts even now and in the coming days
[1:40:41] strongly I believe you can prepare a
[1:40:47] minister for weeks and years and months
[1:40:49] I believe you can change the direction
[1:40:53] right by their standing at the pulpit
[1:40:56] [Music]
[1:40:57] because somebody's calling there's a
[1:41:00] sheep that fell over the crevice
