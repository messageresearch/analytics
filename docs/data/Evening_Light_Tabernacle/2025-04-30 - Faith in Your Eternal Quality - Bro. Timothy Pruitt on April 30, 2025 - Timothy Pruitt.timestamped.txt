[17:00] Go to the key of
[17:01] G. Amen. How many's had a good day
[17:04] today? Looking for a better evening than
[17:07] you had today because we were out in the
[17:09] world, but we've come and we're going to
[17:11] shake that off. Sometimes it's like, you
[17:13] ever hear that expression like come on
[17:15] your fingers or come on your shoe?
[17:17] You're just trying to get it off. Well,
[17:19] I say we stand to our feet. We sing a
[17:22] good old gospel song. This world is not
[17:25] my home. We're just passing through. Our
[17:29] treasures are laid up somewhere beyond
[17:31] the blue. Well, this world is not my
[17:35] home. I'm just passing through.
[17:39] My treasures are laid up somewhere
[17:43] beyond
[17:45] the
[17:47] angels from
[17:50] heaven. And I can't feel at home in this
[17:55] world
[17:57] anymore. Oh
[18:00] Lord, I have nothing like you.
[18:05] If heaven's not my home,
[18:08] then I
[18:10] do the angels back at
[18:13] me from
[18:16] heaven and I can't be at home in this
[18:21] world
[18:23] anymore. They're all expecting me.
[18:27] And that's one thing I know. I fixed it
[18:32] up with
[18:33] Jesus many years
[18:36] ago. I know he'll see me
[18:42] through and I can't feel at home in this
[18:47] world anymore.
[18:50] Oh
[18:52] Lord, I have to pray like
[18:56] you. Heaven's not my home. And Lord,
[19:01] what will I
[19:02] do? The angels beckon
[19:06] me
[19:11] from home in this world anymore.
[19:20] will live
[19:22] eternally. The saints on every
[19:26] hand shout in victory.
[19:30] The soft
[19:32] [Music]
[19:38] sweet in this world
[19:43] [Music]
[19:51] [Music]
[19:53] anymore will I do?
[19:57] [Music]
[20:04] [Applause]
[20:06] heaven. Let's sing that last verse
[20:08] again.
[20:10] us over in the glory land. We'll live
[20:16] eternally. The saints on every hand
[20:20] they're shouting
[20:22] victory the songs of
[20:25] [Music]
[20:26] sweet
[20:32] back in this world anymore.
[20:38] Oh, you
[20:40] know I have to
[20:45] like
[20:46] [Music]
[20:50] my angels
[20:53] back from
[20:56] heaven and I can't hear
[21:01] that. Oh, sing it again.
[21:04] Oh Lord, you know I have no like
[21:11] you not my
[21:14] own. What will I
[21:17] do? Ain't no second
[21:20] me from heaven
[21:25] to feel at home in this world anymore.
[21:32] Bill, I'm so
[21:34] glad Jesus set me
[21:37] free. I'm so glad that Jesus set me
[21:43] free. I'm so
[21:46] glad Jesus set me free. Singing glory
[21:52] [Music]
[21:58] hallelujah. But my Jesus set me free.
[22:02] Oh, Satan had me bound. But my Jesus set
[22:07] me
[22:08] free. Satan had me bound, but Jesus set
[22:13] me free. Singing glory,
[22:18] hallelujah. Jesus set me free. Well, I'm
[22:22] on my way to
[22:24] heaven. Shouting
[22:27] victory. I'm on my way to heaven.
[22:32] Shouting
[22:34] victory on my way to
[22:37] heaven. Shouting
[22:39] victory. Singing glory
[22:43] hallelujah. Oh Jesus set me
[22:47] free. I'm so glad that my Jesus lifted
[22:54] me. I'm so
[22:56] glad my Jesus lifted me.
[23:01] I'm so
[23:03] glad Jesus lifted me. I'm singing glory
[23:09] hallelujah. Will Jesus set me
[23:13] free. I'm so glad that my Jesus set me
[23:20] free. I'm so glad my Jesus set me free.
[23:27] I'm so glad that Jesus set me free.
[23:33] Singing glory
[23:36] hallelujah. Jesus set me
[23:42] free. Hallelujah. Why don't we give the
[23:44] Lord a hand clap of praise
[23:46] tonight?
[23:48] Glory.
[23:50] Amen. Has he set you free? Has he lifted
[23:54] you up? Amen. And it's good to be here
[23:56] tonight gathered with you. As you can
[23:58] see, there are some that weren't able to
[23:59] make it. The storm's kind of rolling
[24:01] through and it's knocked out some
[24:03] lights. I said, "Well, the lights are on
[24:05] here." So, but they couldn't make it.
[24:08] So, we'll just remember them in prayer
[24:10] this evening. We certainly want to
[24:11] remember those that are sick at home or
[24:14] sick away and just uh needing a real
[24:16] touch from the Lord. Ask brother Joe if
[24:19] you wouldn't mind open the opening the
[24:21] service for us
[24:24] tonight and you want to make the
[24:26] announcements
[24:27] [Music]
[24:32] too be here this
[24:35] evening it's great to be in the house of
[24:37] the Lord we have the grave side service
[24:39] for sister Anna Hollis will be this
[24:41] Saturday at 11 o'clock at Patna Cemetery
[24:43] near Hope Arkansas and I'm sure brother
[24:46] James would appreciate any and that
[24:48] could possibly attend. If you'd be
[24:50] there, that'd be great. Talked to
[24:51] brother Ben Coleman this just a few
[24:54] actually about 30 minutes ago. He
[24:56] recovered from the surgery, doing fine,
[24:58] but he's in a lot of pain. Just asked
[24:59] for prayer. And then we just also want
[25:01] to remember brother Kenny Camp in prayer
[25:03] as well. And then
[25:05] u Jason Tagger, brother Jason put a
[25:08] prayer request in for Hunter. He he had
[25:10] had a seizure last night and so he's not
[25:13] feeling well today.
[25:15] Lizzy Grace Hall is also at home
[25:16] suffering with sickness. How many you
[25:18] would have a need this evening? Just
[25:20] lift that need up to the Lord in prayer
[25:22] believe. And I was listening to a sermon
[25:24] this evening was just saying if one or
[25:26] two can just agree on touching any one
[25:29] thing. One or two touching any one thing
[25:32] you could have whatsoever it is you ask
[25:33] for. So we're going to believe that
[25:34] tonight. We're going to touch the hem of
[25:36] his garment and believe. Father, we bow
[25:38] our hearts and our heads to you, Lord.
[25:41] Lord, the Bible would tell us that we
[25:43] look to the heels once cometh our
[25:45] strength. For our help cometh from the
[25:47] Lord. So Lord, we don't look to man. We
[25:50] don't look to doctors even though we
[25:52] appreciate what they provide. Father, we
[25:54] look to you tonight, the author and the
[25:57] finisher of our faith, the giver of
[25:59] every good and perfect gift. And Lord,
[26:01] we know that you formed and fashioned
[26:03] these bodies, Lord. And there is a
[26:05] certain process in which they should
[26:07] operate and work. And the enemy has come
[26:09] in, Lord, and has afflicted many people,
[26:11] Father. And tonight, you see little
[26:14] Hunter Tagert having seizures. But Lord,
[26:17] we curse that in the name of Jesus
[26:19] tonight. And we're going to believe,
[26:21] Lord God, because we're believers. And
[26:22] believers believe in the supernatural.
[26:24] They believe in the word of God. And you
[26:26] said if one or two will agree as a
[26:29] touching any one thing, then we can have
[26:31] whatsoever things we desire. We're
[26:33] agreeing for that young boy, Lord. He
[26:35] can be delivered from these seizures, to
[26:37] never have another bout with it, Father,
[26:39] to not have any remedy or any affliction
[26:42] to follow him. We're believing for the
[26:44] supernatural God who formed and
[26:46] fashioned his body in this universe that
[26:49] we live in to come down in a special way
[26:52] even tonight as the prayer is being
[26:54] made. May you go to him, Lord, and touch
[26:56] him in his body. Lord, not only him, but
[26:59] brother Ben there in the hospital room,
[27:01] recover from this back surgery. God, may
[27:03] you just remove the pain that he's
[27:05] under, Lord. And may you, God, just
[27:07] intervene for him and take all the
[27:09] suffering away, Father. We pray for
[27:12] Brother Kenny Camp, Lord. You see the
[27:13] need, unspoken request there. We just
[27:16] commit him to you. Lord, you see his
[27:17] heart's desire. God, move on the scene
[27:20] in a supernatural way there. Lord, we
[27:22] pray for Brother James Hollis, lost his
[27:25] precious wife.
[27:27] We pray you'll comfort him, the family.
[27:29] Lord, just continue to watch over them
[27:31] tonight. Father, Sister Ruth Puit at
[27:34] home sick, Lord, touch her tonight. Many
[27:36] others, hands lifted all over the
[27:38] building tonight. Father, may you just
[27:40] come on the scene and touch every heart,
[27:42] every life, and minister to every knee.
[27:44] Lord, tonight, we just commit it to you,
[27:46] Lord. Bless Brother Timothy, Father. He
[27:48] would come and just share what's on his
[27:50] heart tonight. Break the bread of life
[27:52] to us, Lord, as we come to your table to
[27:54] feed and to dine. God, may we not go
[27:57] away empty, Lord. May we not go away,
[27:59] Father, without our heart's desire being
[28:02] met tonight. But may you speak, Lord,
[28:04] expressly and intimately to us. We ask
[28:07] in Jesus name. Amen.
[28:14] In your
[28:16] [Music]
[28:19] presence, that's where I
[28:22] know your
[28:27] presence. Oh Lord my God, in your

[30:59] Seeking your
[31:02] way, touching your
[31:06] gra in the clap of the

[40:07] blessings, all glory and
[40:09] honor. Hallelujah.
[40:12] Oh, let's sing it tonight. Are we a
[40:15] thankful people? Yes, we are. I want to
[40:19] say thanks
[40:21] tonight. We say thanks.
[40:26] I give you
[40:28] thanks for
[40:30] all you have done.
[40:36] I am
[40:38] so my soul has found rest. Oh Lord,
[40:51] [Music]
[40:52] thanks. I give you
[40:55] thanks for
[40:57] all
[40:59] you have
[41:03] done. I am so blessed.
[41:07] My soul is bound rest. Oh
[41:11] Lord, I give you.
[41:14] Oh, I just want to say
[41:17] [Music]
[41:20] thanks. I give you
[41:23] thanks for all
[41:30] you. I am so
[41:32] glad. My soul has found rest.
[41:38] Lord, I give you
[41:43] thanks. Hallelujah.
[41:46] I believe we ought to be thankful for
[41:48] God that's rich in mercy that came down
[41:51] and claimed us for his own and called us
[41:55] out. I I believe we ought to be thankful
[41:57] tonight. Thankful we're not living in
[41:59] sin and not knowing who we are, but
[42:02] we've heard his call upon our lives and
[42:05] have something within us to respond to
[42:08] his call. Amen. Let's just go to him in
[42:11] prayer. Father, we come to you tonight,
[42:14] Lord, with our whole heart. Lord, we
[42:16] truly are thankful, Lord. Thankful Lord
[42:19] to be a child of God and be called by
[42:23] your name Lord and to have Lord the mark
[42:26] of approval upon our lives Lord. What a
[42:30] wonderful thing that is Lord. We ask you
[42:32] that you'd help us this evening. Speak
[42:34] to our hearts. Touch us Lord by your
[42:37] presence. We pray in Jesus name.
[42:42] Amen. Amen. You turn to Ephesians 1.
[42:45] Ephesians 1 and verse three.
[42:49] Amen.
[42:50] I just went ahead and had to put most of
[42:53] the scripture down because it's such a
[42:55] wonderful scripture and I believe it
[42:58] pertains to us today. Ephesians 1 and
[43:00] verse three says, "Blessed," I'm going
[43:02] to read out of the amplified if that's
[43:04] okay. "Blessed and worthy of praise be
[43:06] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[43:09] Christ, who has blessed us with every
[43:12] spiritual blessing in heavenly realms in
[43:15] Christ. Just as in his love he chose us
[43:18] in Christ actually selected us for
[43:21] himself as his own before the foundation
[43:25] of the world that we would be holy that
[43:28] is consecrated and set apart for him
[43:31] purposedriven and blameless in his sight
[43:33] in love. He predestinated and lovingly
[43:37] planned for us to be adopted to himself
[43:39] as his own children through Jesus Christ
[43:42] in according with the kind intention and
[43:45] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[43:47] of his glorious grace and favor which he
[43:50] so freely bestowed on us in the beloved
[43:53] his son Jesus Christ. In him we have
[43:56] redemption, that is our deliverance and
[43:59] salvation through his blood which paid
[44:01] the penalty for our sin and resulted in
[44:04] the forgiveness and complete pardon of
[44:06] our sin to in accordance with the riches
[44:09] of his grace which he lavished on us in
[44:12] all wisdom and understanding with
[44:15] practical insight. He made known to us
[44:17] the mystery of his will according to his
[44:20] good pleasure which he purposed in
[44:21] Christ. with regard to the fulfillment
[44:24] of times, that is the end of history,
[44:26] the climax of the ages, to bring all
[44:29] things together in Christ, both things
[44:30] in heaven and things on earth, in whom
[44:33] also we have received an inheritance, a
[44:36] destiny. We were claimed by God as his
[44:39] own, having be been
[44:41] predestinated, chosen, appointed
[44:44] beforehand according to the purpose of
[44:46] him who works everything in agreement
[44:48] with the counsel and design of his will.
[44:52] So that we who were were the first to
[44:54] hope in first to hope in Christ who
[44:57] first put our confidence in him as our
[45:00] Lord and Savior would exist to the
[45:02] praise of his glory. In him you also
[45:05] when you heard the word of truth, the
[45:07] good news of salvation and as a result
[45:10] believed in him were stamped with a seal
[45:12] of the promised Holy Spirit, the one
[45:15] promised by Christ as owned and
[45:18] protected by God. In other words, he put
[45:20] his stamp that he owns you and that
[45:23] you're protected by God. The the spirit
[45:26] is the guarantee, the first installment,
[45:29] the pledge, a foretaste of our
[45:31] inheritance unto the redemption of God's
[45:33] own purchased possession, his believers
[45:36] to the praise of his glory. I I believe
[45:39] we got something to be thankful for.
[45:42] Amen. God bless you. You can be seated.
[45:45] You turn the monitors down just a little
[45:47] bit.
[45:48] [Music]
[45:51] Amen. So we read here in Ephesians 1
[45:54] says, "We were chosen in Christ before
[45:58] the foundation of the world." Not only
[46:01] were we chosen by him, but we were
[46:03] chosen that we would be holy and without
[46:06] blame. And we were predestinated to the
[46:09] adoption of children by Jesus Christ.
[46:12] Now, brother Brandon would take this and
[46:14] he would say in the church age book, he
[46:16] said, "He has chosen us in him, Jesus,
[46:19] before the foundation of the world."
[46:21] That means we were right there with him
[46:23] in the mind and thoughts of God before
[46:26] the foundation of the world. Therefore,
[46:28] that gives an eternal quality to the
[46:31] elect. And you cannot get away from
[46:33] that. And I I want to speak to you
[46:35] tonight on faith in your eternal
[46:37] quality. Now quality is a distinct
[46:40] attribute or characteristic that's
[46:43] possessed or possessed by someone. You
[46:46] know as we look at this we were all
[46:48] pre-planned by God. Not one of you are
[46:51] here by accident. Nothing happens by
[46:54] chance with God. Amen. He knows all
[46:57] about you. He it was all pre-planned.
[46:59] You were planned no matter of fact many
[47:01] generations back so that you could be
[47:04] even here tonight. Just to think one
[47:06] that one time he said I'll repeat this
[47:08] again. You at one time was in your
[47:10] father a gene of your father. He didn't
[47:12] know you at that time. Neither did you
[47:14] know him. But you see when you were put
[47:16] in the bedding ground the womb of the
[47:18] mother through holy wedlock. And then
[47:20] you became a person expressed in the
[47:23] image like your father. Amen. You was in
[47:26] his just as the same naturally speaking.
[47:29] Amen. So was you in his mind. Amen.
[47:31] Before the foundation of the world. So
[47:33] again, I want to reiterate some some
[47:35] things as we begin to go into this
[47:37] thought. Your birth here upon the earth
[47:40] was no accident. Your life upon this
[47:43] earth is not by chance. Amen. Your
[47:46] parents may not have planned you to be
[47:48] born, but and they may have even gave
[47:50] you to someone else, but God planned for
[47:53] you and he will never give you away or
[47:56] let you go. Amen. He was not at all
[47:59] surprised when you were born. In fact,
[48:01] he expected it. He knew that you would
[48:03] be here long before you were conceived
[48:06] by your parents. You were conceived in
[48:08] the mind of God. He thought of you
[48:10] first. It is not fate. It is not chance.
[48:13] It is not luck. It is not coincidence
[48:16] that you're breathing at this very
[48:17] moment. Amen. You're alive because God
[48:20] wanted to create you. Amen. The Bible.
[48:23] Don't pay attention to the rain. Amen.
[48:25] Let's pay attention to what we're
[48:26] talking about here. Amen. The Bible
[48:28] says, "The Lord will accomplish that
[48:30] which concerns me."
[48:34] Amen. So God, Amen, is is going to, he's
[48:36] got a purpose in your life. In other
[48:38] words, his purpose for you will be f
[48:41] fulfilled. He didn't he didn't just
[48:43] create you to see if he could create
[48:46] something. He, as we've heard, he didn't
[48:48] just create a tree to just see if he
[48:50] could create one. He He didn't create a
[48:52] blade of grass just to see if he create
[48:54] one. But everything that he created has
[48:57] a purpose and and it's God's purpose.
[48:59] And God prescribed every single detail
[49:03] of your life and of your even even of
[49:05] your body. You know, much as we may not
[49:08] like it, he chose your face. He chose
[49:10] the color of your skin. He chose your
[49:12] hair. He chose every feature of your
[49:15] body. He custom made you just the way he
[49:18] wanted you. Amen. He also determined,
[49:21] Amen. even the talents, the natural
[49:23] talents that you would possess and and
[49:26] even the uniqueness of your personality.
[49:28] The Bible says in Psalms 139 and verse
[49:31] 15, "My frame was not hidden from you
[49:34] when I was being formed in the secret
[49:36] and intricate parts and and I was
[49:39] skillfully made as if embroidered with
[49:42] many colors in the depth of the earth
[49:44] because God made you for a reason." and
[49:47] and he's decided that when you would be
[49:49] born and how long you would live, he
[49:51] planned for your days in advance. He
[49:54] chose the exact moment of your birth and
[49:57] your death. That's right. Amen. The
[50:00] Bible says in Psalms 139 and verse 16,
[50:03] he said, "Your eyes have seen my
[50:05] unformed substance, and in your book and
[50:08] in your book were all written the days
[50:10] that were appointed for me, when it when
[50:12] as yet there was not one of them even
[50:15] taken shape. Before one of my days on
[50:18] this earth every ever took shape, ever
[50:21] was a moment or a minute or a second
[50:23] that I was breathing, my days were
[50:26] already appointed. My life was already
[50:28] preset. And he says, "How precious are
[50:32] the thoughts you have of me, oh God? How
[50:34] vast is the sum of them? If I could
[50:36] count them, they would be outnumbered.
[50:38] They would outnumber the sand." See, God
[50:41] left no detail to chance.
[50:45] Amen. And he planned it all for his
[50:47] purpose. Amen. The Bible says that he
[50:50] even chose what nation you would be born
[50:53] in. Did you know that? Acts chapter 17
[50:56] and verse 26. And he made from every
[50:59] from one man every nation of mankind to
[51:02] live on the face of the earth, having
[51:04] determined their appointed times and the
[51:07] boundaries of their land and
[51:08] territories. This was so that they would
[51:11] seek God if perhaps they might grasp for
[51:14] him or find him. though he was not far
[51:16] from each one of us. For in him we live
[51:19] and move and exist. That is in him we
[51:22] actually have our being. Even as some of
[51:25] our own your own poets have said, for we
[51:27] also are his children. So God would put
[51:30] you in a certain place. Amen. A certain
[51:33] time or a certain uh state or a certain
[51:37] family. Why? Because he knew where you
[51:39] had to be so you could come to that
[51:41] place that he could call you out of
[51:43] where you were. He had a predestinated
[51:46] moment for your life. No matter where
[51:48] you was at, no matter if it was in a
[51:50] barroom or or in a tore up family. God
[51:53] put you in that place so his call could
[51:56] reach you. So he could that that moment
[51:59] could come to your life. He knew where
[52:01] it had to be. Amen. It wasn't it wasn't
[52:03] by chance. God planned where you would
[52:05] be born. Therefore, he planned that you
[52:08] would live for his purpose. Your race or
[52:10] nationality are no accident.
[52:14] Come on, somebody. Listen. In other
[52:16] words, nothing in your life is by random
[52:19] choice or a whim by God.
[52:23] Amen. It's all for a purpose. So God
[52:26] decided how you would be born, you know,
[52:28] regardless of the circumstances of your
[52:30] birth. Many of us maybe didn't have a
[52:32] happy birth. Maybe some of our parents
[52:34] gave us away were were, you know, didn't
[52:37] want us for whatever reason and gave us
[52:39] to somebody else. But Amen. Maybe that's
[52:41] what happened to you. God had a plan for
[52:44] your life.
[52:47] Amen. God had a plan. It doesn't matter
[52:49] whether your parents were good or
[52:51] whether it was bad or whether they was
[52:53] indifferent. God knew that these two
[52:55] individuals possessed the exact quality
[52:58] that he had to have. So he brought them
[53:01] together. So because he had you in his
[53:03] mind,
[53:05] he couldn't do that with your adopted
[53:07] parents. So he did it with some maybe
[53:09] some young teenager or some young man.
[53:11] God in his grace and his mercy brought
[53:14] it all together that you could have
[53:16] breath upon this earth. And it's not by
[53:18] accident. It's not by will,
[53:23] but it's by a purpose of God.
[53:26] God's purpose even took into account
[53:28] human error.
[53:33] I don't know. I'd have myself a shouting
[53:35] fit. Amen. It took into account human
[53:39] error. He knew exactly what DNA he
[53:42] wanted you to have.
[53:45] And God does not do anything
[53:47] accidentally. Neither does he make
[53:49] mistakes. How many can say amen to that?
[53:53] So, did God make you?
[53:57] Then you're not a mistake.
[54:00] Come on, somebody. I know the devil
[54:02] wants to pound that in sometimes. You,
[54:04] some of you young people, well, nobody
[54:05] loves me. Nobody cares. My parents don't
[54:07] even Amen. You are not a mistake. That's
[54:10] right. You are not here by accident.
[54:13] You're not here just because God wanted
[54:15] to have somebody to walk here on this
[54:17] earth. You were hid here. You were put
[54:19] here for a purpose.
[54:25] He has a reason for everything he
[54:27] creates. Every plant, every animal was
[54:31] planned by God. Every person was
[54:34] designed with a purpose in his mind.
[54:37] Now, we as human beings may not conceive
[54:39] the purpose of every bug or every animal
[54:42] or everything. Some of them we think are
[54:44] pretty. Some of them we think are ugly
[54:45] and we wonder what kind of purpose it
[54:46] have. But God apparently had a purpose
[54:49] to make some ugly creatures.
[54:53] They're not very pretty. You don't look
[54:54] at them say, "Wow, I'd like to own one
[54:56] of
[54:57] them." I We live in Louisiana, so I just
[55:00] use some Louisiana animals. How many
[55:02] ever seen an armadillo and thought,
[55:03] "Well, that's pretty."
[55:05] No, it's not very pretty, but it has a
[55:07] purpose.
[55:09] It's not maybe the greatest of of
[55:11] animals, and you don't see it in the
[55:13] glory that you might see a b, you know,
[55:15] bald eagle flying or or a lion or a
[55:18] horse running across the pasture, and
[55:19] you say, "Wow, that's beautiful." Amen.
[55:21] But God has a purpose. Amen. And listen,
[55:25] Satan has tried to put things in
[55:27] people's minds and their hearts, and
[55:29] they think sometimes that maybe I'm not
[55:30] a beautiful person or I don't I don't
[55:33] have this attribute or I don't have
[55:34] that. It doesn't matter what kind of
[55:36] earthly or fleshly attribute you have or
[55:39] you don't have. What matters is you have
[55:41] an attribute of God on the inside of
[55:44] you. And God has placed you here for a
[55:47] purpose.
[55:52] Amen. It's Satan that wants to get us on
[55:54] these fleshly things. You know, do I
[55:56] look beautiful? Do I look handsome or do
[55:58] I look this or do I look that? Amen.
[56:01] There's a lot of people that's beautiful
[56:02] pe people, but they're evil
[56:05] and their minds are on evil continually.
[56:08] So, what's more, what's
[56:10] better to have a fleshly attribute of
[56:13] somebody that wants to be, you know,
[56:15] voted as the most beautiful person in
[56:16] the world?
[56:18] Whoopdedoo. What about having the
[56:20] attribute of God that was placed in you
[56:22] before the foundation of the world?
[56:24] because all those fleshly attributes and
[56:26] qualities that we look at and Satan
[56:28] wants to put up as great qualities of
[56:30] life and great great qualities in this
[56:32] person or that person because they can
[56:34] do this or they can do that. Amen. One
[56:36] day it'll be gone and forgotten.
[56:39] Might have a I might have a book or
[56:40] something written about them that one
[56:42] day it'll be gone and forgotten. Amen.
[56:45] But there's something on the inside of a
[56:46] believer that'll never be gone and
[56:49] forgotten.
[56:51] Hallelujah. But it'll still be there on
[56:53] the inside of you. It's an attribute of
[56:56] God. It's eternal.
[57:00] Amen. You know, the only way you can be
[57:01] a son or daughter of God is you have to
[57:03] have eternal
[57:05] life. There's only one form of eternal
[57:07] life and that's God's life. There's only
[57:10] one form of eternal life and that's God.
[57:12] There. So to be a son or God, you have
[57:14] to be in him always. The gene of your
[57:17] life, spiritual life tonight was in God
[57:19] the Father before there ever was a
[57:21] molecule. You are nothing but the
[57:23] manifestation of the gene life of God as
[57:26] a son of God. Now you're expressed after
[57:29] his word has come to you and lit up and
[57:31] lit your life up. You're expressing
[57:33] God's life in you because you're a son
[57:35] or daughter of God. He said, "Do you get
[57:37] it?" See, he said, "Whatever you are,
[57:39] God knew that you would be here because
[57:41] you have to be one of his genes or his
[57:45] attributes. You had to be or you never
[57:47] would be." That's right.
[57:50] Amen. If you got eternal life, then it
[57:52] always was eternal life. And God before
[57:55] there was a foundation of the world knew
[57:58] you would be here. And when the word,
[58:00] Amen, the washing of the water of the
[58:02] word fell upon you, it expressed in a
[58:05] being. Amen. You might have looked like
[58:07] a sinner.
[58:13] It might have looked all broken up and
[58:15] it looked impossible there was anything
[58:17] of value on the inside of you. But all
[58:20] of a sudden, the washing of the water of
[58:22] the word begin to come over the over you
[58:25] and begin to flow down through you. And
[58:27] it washed away all the sin. It washed
[58:30] away all the sorrows. It washed away all
[58:33] the things Satan had told you you was
[58:35] all your life. And on the inside, it
[58:38] begin to show us gene of God that was
[58:41] placed there before the foundation of
[58:42] the world. Wasn't placed there by your
[58:45] father or your mother, it was placed
[58:47] there by God. Because if it was placed
[58:50] by somebody, Amen. If it was placed by a
[58:52] pastor or placed by your father, it's a
[58:55] it's not eternal.
[58:57] It's a handed down religion. That's
[58:59] right.
[59:01] Come on now. We're not a handed down
[59:03] religion kind of people. Amen. For it to
[59:06] be eternal. It's got to come from God.
[59:10] That's why that's why it's impossible to
[59:12] hand down what we believe to somebody
[59:14] else is some learned behavior. This
[59:16] ain't about learned behavior of nothing.
[59:19] It's about being born again.
[59:22] It's about the washing of the water of
[59:23] the word coming over you and washing
[59:25] away the things that you thought one
[59:27] time were once were important or you
[59:29] thought was who you were or you thought
[59:31] that this is what you would always be.
[59:33] But God, rich in mercy saw something
[59:35] different. Amen. The woman at the well,
[59:38] she thought, amen, her life was
[59:39] destroyed. She thought it was over. She
[59:41] thought, man, I done gave it all up and
[59:43] I I can't even come to the well when
[59:45] other women come because of my life. But
[59:47] one day there was a man that had been
[59:49] there had her in her mind his mind
[59:51] before the foundation of the world. And
[59:54] he's sitting on a whale when she comes
[59:56] and she begins to realize this is not
[59:58] I'm not a Harley. This is not who I am.
[1:00:01] But I'm a daughter of God and I I have
[1:00:03] seen who I am. Come see the man who told
[1:00:06] me all that I've done and who I am.
[1:00:12] There was something on the inside of
[1:00:13] her. They went beyond what Satan tried
[1:00:16] to mar her life up
[1:00:18] with. Today there's people sitting even
[1:00:21] on these pews that Satan tried to mar
[1:00:23] their
[1:00:24] life, tried to hurt them, try to make
[1:00:27] them seem like so insignificant and and
[1:00:29] and unimportant and there's no way they
[1:00:32] would ever fit, amen, into the economy
[1:00:34] of God. But something was still there on
[1:00:36] the inside of them. Amen. And when that
[1:00:39] word began to speak to what was on the
[1:00:41] inside, what was it? It was the word
[1:00:44] speaking to the word. Come on. It was
[1:00:47] eternal speaking to the eternal that had
[1:00:49] been placed there on the inside of them.
[1:00:51] They came from their father and they're
[1:00:53] going to go back to their father.
[1:00:57] Word coming
[1:00:59] down. Said if we're those attributes of
[1:01:02] God. Therefore, if we are, we cannot
[1:01:04] live by creeds. We won't live by
[1:01:06] denominationalism. We'll live by the
[1:01:08] word because a bride is part of the
[1:01:10] bridegroom. Like any wife is part of her
[1:01:12] husband, you must be that word bride.
[1:01:15] What is the word bride? The
[1:01:16] manifestation of this hour, the bride.
[1:01:18] Not a creed, not a denomination, but a
[1:01:20] living article of God. A living
[1:01:23] attribute of God displayed to the world.
[1:01:25] The attributes of God in the formation
[1:01:27] of the bride has to be expressed in this
[1:01:29] hour that we're now living. Martha could
[1:01:31] Martin Luther couldn't express that
[1:01:33] because it was only the beginning. Amen.
[1:01:35] But it had to come all the way down. And
[1:01:37] he said, "Therefore, the bride in the
[1:01:39] rapture will come forth, and they'll
[1:01:41] they're there they're there to be all
[1:01:43] pre-planned by God. All backed up by God
[1:01:45] from the beginning. We knew every man.
[1:01:48] He knew every man, every place who would
[1:01:50] sit, everything. It's all pre-planned by
[1:01:53] God. God knew it would be here. And he
[1:01:55] made a way so it would be when we got
[1:01:57] there. He's gone to prepare a place for
[1:02:00] you. And when you get there, it'll all
[1:02:02] be prepared just like even tonight has
[1:02:04] been prepared.
[1:02:07] Come on, somebody. This service has been
[1:02:10] prepared.
[1:02:13] Amen. Some of you had to push through
[1:02:15] storms and you had to push through
[1:02:17] things in your that you had to face and
[1:02:18] you had had an attitude. I'm going to
[1:02:20] get to the house of God and you came.
[1:02:22] Why? Because it was pre-planned by God
[1:02:25] that you'd be sitting here today. That
[1:02:28] maybe you can hear again that you're not
[1:02:30] an accident.
[1:02:31] You're not here just by a whim that God
[1:02:34] tried and he tried this and he tried
[1:02:36] that. But God actually pre-planned your
[1:02:38] life and he brought you to this moment.
[1:02:51] stumble at the word
[1:02:53] predestination. He said, "Don't stumble
[1:02:54] at that word." He said, "I want to show
[1:02:56] you in Ephesians 1:5, which we read." He
[1:03:00] said, "Just as you were in your father,
[1:03:02] as I said the other night, just as you
[1:03:04] was in your father at the beginning, if
[1:03:06] you wasn't, you wouldn't be here
[1:03:09] naturally
[1:03:10] speaking." But you see, it had to go to
[1:03:12] a bed ground in order to bring forth to
[1:03:15] bring forth the life. And now you're his
[1:03:18] son or you're his daughter. It's a seed.
[1:03:20] If you're a Christian now, genuine
[1:03:22] predestinated seed, you was in God, you
[1:03:26] was always in God. The germ of life,
[1:03:28] which is an attribute of God, which was
[1:03:31] his thought. For instance, he says this
[1:03:33] pretty lady sitting here. God said in
[1:03:35] this day there will be a girl, her name
[1:03:37] will be so and so. She'll be this and
[1:03:39] thus she'll look like that. But even
[1:03:41] knew the very hour she would sit and
[1:03:43] listen to this message dressed in a red
[1:03:46] dress.
[1:03:48] Listen, God knows what clothes you're
[1:03:50] going to wear to church.
[1:03:56] He apparently knows what you was
[1:03:57] wearing, what you're going to be wearing
[1:03:58] in the
[1:04:00] future cuz there going to be a young
[1:04:02] young looking man with a checkered green
[1:04:04] shirt.
[1:04:06] Amen. God knows details about our life.
[1:04:10] We think we got it all planned out and
[1:04:12] we want to do this and we want to do
[1:04:13] that and we're if we're just submit
[1:04:15] ourselves to the plan of God. Amen. God
[1:04:18] has a purpose for us. He has a purpose
[1:04:21] for our lives. He said for instance, you
[1:04:23] know, sitting here and hear this message
[1:04:25] this message dressed in a red dress.
[1:04:27] That was his thought.
[1:04:30] Whoever your husband is, where whoever
[1:04:32] he is, and he would bring this together
[1:04:34] and you sit here today in this city on
[1:04:36] this very day, there could be no way for
[1:04:39] you to fail it because it it was in his
[1:04:43] mind. You're growing as long as your
[1:04:45] seed inside growing. You have to produce
[1:04:48] exactly what the seed said you would do.
[1:04:50] That's exactly it's his word. He keeps
[1:04:52] his word and he watches over it. So just
[1:04:55] as as there's a people here upon the
[1:04:57] earth with a gene seed of God placed
[1:04:59] inside of them and it's producing
[1:05:01] something in their life, no wonder we
[1:05:03] see a whole world that's producing the
[1:05:06] seeds, amen, that are in their lives.
[1:05:08] Because there's two sers that went into
[1:05:10] the field
[1:05:12] and we're seeing seeds that are being
[1:05:14] manifest that one day that was just in
[1:05:16] baby
[1:05:17] form small innocent looking and it
[1:05:20] looked like it wasn't going to be too
[1:05:22] big of a deal that you know you know
[1:05:24] innocent women get the rights to vote
[1:05:26] and this all these innocent things that
[1:05:29] were happening and today we're seeing it
[1:05:31] grow up.
[1:05:33] Come on. We're seeing it grow up to the
[1:05:36] place I was talking with a lady today.
[1:05:39] She gonna probably hear this. She gonna
[1:05:41] tell me about it next time I get a
[1:05:42] haircut. But talking to her about I was
[1:05:44] just I've been kind of on I got I got
[1:05:47] kind of blown away. I don't know why
[1:05:49] because it's happening more and more
[1:05:51] every day. But you know there's a big
[1:05:53] deal in the news right now of this
[1:05:55] man pretending to be like a woman
[1:05:58] pretending to be a woman winning all the
[1:06:00] women uh races and water sports. And he
[1:06:04] you look I I thought you know some of
[1:06:05] them they they might look like a woman.
[1:06:07] This This dude don't even look like a
[1:06:09] woman. Is a
[1:06:11] dude with his hair down. Muscles bigger
[1:06:15] than anybody in here nearly
[1:06:18] and he's pretending to be a woman. What
[1:06:20] are we seeing? We're seeing seeds that
[1:06:23] have grown up to maturity.
[1:06:27] It one day may look like an innocent
[1:06:29] thing. And that's what it, you know,
[1:06:30] started. Well, we just want to have a
[1:06:31] right to get together. We want a right
[1:06:33] to show love. And there all this, you
[1:06:35] know, little innocent stuff that they
[1:06:37] try to portray. And now it's so f it's
[1:06:40] almost humorous that that we come to
[1:06:43] women's rights, women's rights, women's
[1:06:44] right. And now men acting like a woman
[1:06:48] is win woman of the
[1:06:51] year. Now tell me how that's
[1:06:54] happening. Tell me how that's a woman's
[1:06:56] rights. It is seeds that are coming to f
[1:06:59] fruition. This is why we're seeing
[1:07:01] people coming out with purple hair and
[1:07:03] green hair and stuff all over their
[1:07:05] bodies. What is it? It's what's on the
[1:07:07] inside of them is coming to fruition.
[1:07:11] But all of that is just temporary.
[1:07:14] All those seeds are just temporary
[1:07:16] because they're going to go up and
[1:07:18] they're going to come and mature. And
[1:07:20] the harvester is going to come through
[1:07:22] and he's going to bind the tears
[1:07:23] together, but he's going to bind the
[1:07:25] wheat together. And the tears are going
[1:07:27] to be burned, but the wheat is going to
[1:07:29] go into the gardener.
[1:07:32] Come on, somebody. Amen. I'm not what
[1:07:34] I'm talking about you. What's on the
[1:07:36] inside of you is not a temporary seed.
[1:07:40] It's an eternal sea. And there's an
[1:07:42] eternal force on the inside of you. That
[1:07:45] force was so great, it broke through
[1:07:47] drugs. It broke through alcohol. It
[1:07:49] broke through pornography. It broke
[1:07:51] through every kind of hell. And it came
[1:07:54] forth. Amen. And this seed is going to
[1:07:57] keep growing and growing and growing
[1:08:00] until it breaks through every darkness.
[1:08:02] It breaks through every devil. It breaks
[1:08:04] through every spirit of hell. And it
[1:08:06] takes a rapture.
[1:08:08] [Applause]
[1:08:11] It's coming to f
[1:08:14] fruition. It's coming together.
[1:08:18] We can see it.
[1:08:22] He said, he says here in the church age
[1:08:25] book, I believe it again, he said, let
[1:08:26] me interject a thought in here. Even our
[1:08:28] natural birth is based upon
[1:08:32] election. The female ovaries produce
[1:08:35] just so many eggs. But why is it on a
[1:08:38] certain day, a certain time, a certain
[1:08:40] egg came down, not another one, a
[1:08:42] certain one,
[1:08:44] and then amongst the male sperm, for no
[1:08:47] known reason, a certain germ attaches
[1:08:49] itself to that egg, while others could
[1:08:51] have done just as easily. They could
[1:08:53] attach themselves, maybe had a better
[1:08:55] opportunity to do so, but did not and
[1:08:57] perished. What was it? There's an
[1:09:00] intelligence behind all of this
[1:09:01] otherwise. What determines whether the
[1:09:03] baby is a boy or a girl, blonde or
[1:09:05] brunette, light or dark type of eyes?
[1:09:08] With these thoughts in mind, think about
[1:09:09] Joshua and Caleb. Did not Jesus say in
[1:09:11] John 6:49, "Your fathers died did eat
[1:09:14] mana in the wilderness or the dead."
[1:09:16] Those parents that died were necessary
[1:09:18] as the forefathers of the people to whom
[1:09:21] Jesus was speaking. They perished. Yet
[1:09:23] they were in the election of God
[1:09:24] naturally as Joshua and Caleb were
[1:09:27] spiritually. But to go on, these elect
[1:09:29] were not only the eternal thoughts of
[1:09:31] God. that were to be expressed in flesh
[1:09:34] in their due season. But these same
[1:09:36] elect are called by another name. And he
[1:09:38] goes into Romans 4. Therefore, it is of
[1:09:40] faith that it might be by grace the end
[1:09:43] the promise might be made sure to all
[1:09:45] the seed. Not to that only, but which by
[1:09:46] the law, but that which is of the faith
[1:09:48] of Abraham who is the father of us all.
[1:09:51] Then he goes into Romans 9 and verse 7
[1:09:53] through13. It speaks about Cain and
[1:09:55] Abel. Amen. One of Jacob I've loved,
[1:09:58] Esau of hated. And he said, "According
[1:10:00] to Romans 4:16, we find that God has
[1:10:03] given a sure promise to all of Abraham's
[1:10:06] seed." And Paul puts himself and all
[1:10:08] believers under that designation because
[1:10:11] he said Abraham is the father of us all.
[1:10:13] And he goes on not to narrow down his
[1:10:15] definition, but rather to finalize it.
[1:10:17] And Galatians 3 identified the seed with
[1:10:20] Jesus and counted the seed children.
[1:10:24] He brings it right down. He said, "What
[1:10:26] was it?" It was election and choosing of
[1:10:28] God. Those who are of the royal sea are
[1:10:31] of the elect of God. It's a
[1:10:33] predestinated fornown of God. You were
[1:10:36] always in his mind and in his thoughts.
[1:10:39] God just don't think about you on bad
[1:10:41] days and you're going through a bad
[1:10:43] time. God has thought about you before
[1:10:45] the foundation of the world.
[1:10:48] Hallelujah.
[1:10:50] He said in plain plain language, the
[1:10:53] true bride of Christ was in the mind of
[1:10:55] God eternally.
[1:11:02] Eternally. You don't just have a bad day
[1:11:04] and all said, "God, help me." You're
[1:11:07] already in his mind. He's already
[1:11:09] thinking about you. He's already
[1:11:11] preparing a way of escape.
[1:11:15] Come on. He's already watching over you.
[1:11:18] He's already looking after you for your
[1:11:21] best interest.
[1:11:23] Your best interest. He has your best
[1:11:25] interest at heart. He's not looking for
[1:11:28] you to come and be destroyed and tore
[1:11:30] down and Amen. God has the best interest
[1:11:32] of you. Amen. What What is his What is
[1:11:35] he Is he interested in me being a
[1:11:37] millionaire? Maybe not. Is he interested
[1:11:38] in me having all kinds of cars and this
[1:11:40] that? Maybe not. his interest in you the
[1:11:43] best is eternal life.
[1:11:47] That is what's in his interest. It's not
[1:11:51] so much life here on earth. This is just
[1:11:53] a temporary thing. It's a temporary
[1:11:55] moment. If you're going through
[1:11:57] suffering, it's a temporary suffering.
[1:12:00] If you're going through sickness as a
[1:12:01] temporary sickness, God is interested.
[1:12:04] His best interest in you is about
[1:12:06] eternity. That's right.
[1:12:11] Each member came forth and became
[1:12:13] expressed and took his place in the
[1:12:14] body. Thus this bride is a literal
[1:12:17] spoken word seed bride the very spoken
[1:12:21] word of God.
[1:12:23] You are just the same as this earth and
[1:12:25] sun. Let there
[1:12:32] be Joe. We in
[1:12:35] church dreaming.
[1:12:39] He said, "Let there be
[1:12:41] light." Is there light out there today?
[1:12:43] What did you see? Anybody see the sun
[1:12:44] today?
[1:12:46] Well, I didn't see nothing but clouds,
[1:12:48] but did you see light?
[1:12:51] Get your focus off the clouds and get it
[1:12:53] on the light.
[1:12:54] Amen. That sun is still up there. No
[1:12:56] matter if there's clouds in the sky or
[1:12:58] not, that sun is there because God's
[1:13:00] word said it would be. He said, "Let
[1:13:02] there been for millions or whatever kind
[1:13:04] of years it has been hanging there
[1:13:06] giving out light."
[1:13:09] It is a spoken word seed of God. He said
[1:13:12] it and it happens and it's still there
[1:13:15] today. And not one of us gets up and
[1:13:17] worries about it. Hey, one of us on a
[1:13:19] Sunday morning, Monday morning, whatever
[1:13:21] morning, get up and say, "Man, I wonder
[1:13:22] if the sun's coming up today. I wonder
[1:13:24] if it's going to give its life today or
[1:13:26] like today, I wonder if it's going to
[1:13:27] come up and shine today. I wonder, I
[1:13:29] wonder." No, we ain't wondered about it.
[1:13:31] None. Because we know God decreed it and
[1:13:34] God pre-planned it and God put it there
[1:13:36] for a purpose. and is still serving his
[1:13:38] purpose today. Well, why don't you have
[1:13:41] the same attitude, amen, towards the
[1:13:43] spoken word, seed, bride of Jesus
[1:13:45] Christ, that she will remain. She will
[1:13:48] be there. She will still stand. There
[1:13:51] ain't a devil in hell that can take her
[1:13:52] down. There ain't a sickness. There
[1:13:54] ain't a disease. There ain't a sin.
[1:13:56] There ain't nothing that can destroy the
[1:13:59] eternal purpose of God. I can have faith
[1:14:02] in what God has called me to
[1:14:04] be. Amen.
[1:14:08] It's
[1:14:09] eternal. Though she be feminine in
[1:14:11] designation, she is also called the body
[1:14:14] of Christ. It is very apparent that she
[1:14:16] ought to be called that, for she was
[1:14:18] predestinated in him. Came from the same
[1:14:24] source. Hello.
[1:14:27] Ought to be some shouting going on right
[1:14:29] there. I came from the same source.
[1:14:33] Same source was eternal with him. And
[1:14:35] now manifesting God in many membered
[1:14:37] body whereas once God was manifested in
[1:14:40] one member our Lord Jesus Christ. Then
[1:14:42] here we are coming to conclusion as the
[1:14:45] eternal log go of God was manifest in
[1:14:48] the son and Jesus dwelt the fullness of
[1:14:49] the godhead bodily and that eternal one
[1:14:52] was a father manifested in flesh thereby
[1:14:54] gained the title of son even so we
[1:14:57] eternal in his thoughts and our turn
[1:14:58] became the many membered spoken word
[1:15:01] seed manifested in flesh and those
[1:15:03] eternal thoughts were now manifested in
[1:15:05] flesh are the sons of god even as we are
[1:15:09] so called we did not become seed by the
[1:15:11] rebirth. We were seed and therefore we
[1:15:14] could be reborn. Hallelujah. For only
[1:15:17] the elect can be reborn. But because we
[1:15:20] were seen is the reason you could be
[1:15:23] quickened.
[1:15:32] Eternal. You were fornown by God before
[1:15:36] you ever lived upon the earth. What it
[1:15:38] says in Romans 8:29. You were
[1:15:41] fornown. Jesus never come to the earth
[1:15:43] and died just to see if there by chance
[1:15:47] somebody be saved because he
[1:15:49] died, right? He came He wouldn't have
[1:15:54] did that. No. God don't run his office
[1:15:56] business like that in heaven loosely.
[1:15:59] Jesus came to earth to die for a
[1:16:01] purpose. Not to just see if it might
[1:16:04] somebody be saved. But before the
[1:16:07] foundation of the world, he foresaw the
[1:16:10] whole thing. And by his fornowledge, he
[1:16:12] forneew it. He knew that there was going
[1:16:14] to be a church called out without spot
[1:16:16] or without wrinkle. Therefore, there had
[1:16:18] to be preparations made to save that
[1:16:22] church. He came to die so I can be
[1:16:24] saved. Amen. He ca So he made
[1:16:27] preparations to save that church. He
[1:16:30] said Jesus, he didn't just so send Jesus
[1:16:32] not perhaps somebody might get it.
[1:16:34] neighbor. Perhaps somebody might be
[1:16:36] saved. He knew who was going to be
[1:16:38] saved. He would have a people called out
[1:16:41] and you are they.
[1:16:45] Hello. You are they.
[1:16:48] He would have a people that would
[1:16:50] believe in divine healing and you are
[1:16:53] they.
[1:16:55] Hallelujah. He would believe in a people
[1:16:58] who would be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:17:00] and you are there.
[1:17:02] He would believe with There would be a
[1:17:04] people who would believe they shall lay
[1:17:06] hands upon the sick and they shall
[1:17:08] recover and you are they.
[1:17:14] God knew it. He knew there'd be
[1:17:16] unbelievers, of course, but he also knew
[1:17:19] there would be believers. Hallelujah. He
[1:17:22] forneew it. Therefore, he could foray it
[1:17:24] would be that way. He forneew so he
[1:17:26] could foresake. I love that. I love just
[1:17:29] how simple the prophet of God puts it.
[1:17:31] And so he sent Jesus only for those who
[1:17:34] would believe
[1:17:36] it. Of course, you know, we got the
[1:17:38] websites out there that said Jesus maybe
[1:17:40] lived here on the earth, but he was just
[1:17:42] know, you know, all kind of doubts and
[1:17:43] confusions. But Jesus
[1:17:46] came, lived on earth, died, buried,
[1:17:51] resurrected, not for the
[1:17:54] unbeliever, but for those who's going to
[1:17:56] believe. He knew there would be se seven
[1:17:59] or 6,000 more thousands of 2,000 more
[1:18:02] years. He knew it was going to take
[1:18:04] place. Church ages, seven more church
[1:18:06] ages. He knew all of that. But he knew
[1:18:08] at the seventh one there was still going
[1:18:10] to be somebody says, "I believe it.
[1:18:13] I believe he died for me."
[1:18:18] Right, brother Philip? I believe he died
[1:18:20] for me.
[1:18:22] I believe, yeah, he walked up that hill.
[1:18:24] I believe he went to the cross. I
[1:18:26] believe he hung there on those nails. I
[1:18:28] believe when he hung his head in the
[1:18:30] locks of his shoulder. I believe he died
[1:18:32] for me.
[1:18:34] I believe he done all of that just for
[1:18:37] me that I could be healed, saved,
[1:18:40] delivered, that I could be a son of God.
[1:18:43] That I could have the right to enter
[1:18:45] into the throne of God. I believe that.
[1:18:48] Maybe some don't believe it, but I
[1:18:50] believe it. He said, "Here they are
[1:18:51] today." Listen to what he say. He said
[1:18:54] he knew Jesus knew there would be some
[1:18:55] who believed. And here they are today
[1:18:57] gathered in this spot to accept what God
[1:19:01] for and for knew would take place. So
[1:19:04] God made a preparation for those who
[1:19:06] would
[1:19:11] believe. God forneew there was going to
[1:19:13] be gathered in this spot on a rainy day.
[1:19:17] Fought to get here. Some gave up and
[1:19:20] stayed home. But they knew they was
[1:19:23] going to be here. And he knew the The
[1:19:26] lights were still going to be on.
[1:19:30] You may not have known it. You probably
[1:19:32] doubted it.
[1:19:35] Good reason
[1:19:37] to. But he knew the lights was going to
[1:19:39] be
[1:19:40] on. He knew what was going to take place
[1:19:43] in this service. He knew somebody might
[1:19:45] get the victory. Somebody might get
[1:19:47] healings. Somebody might get delivered.
[1:19:49] Whatever. I don't know what he has
[1:19:50] pre-planned for for this service, but he
[1:19:52] knew and he knew who was going to come,
[1:19:54] what needs there was going to have.
[1:19:56] Therefore, he's going to plan for them
[1:19:58] to get delivered.
[1:20:01] He was going to plan a certain sermon to
[1:20:03] go a certain way and to break through
[1:20:05] all these things. Why? Cuz somebody
[1:20:07] needs a healing.
[1:20:09] Somebody needs a saving. Somebody needs
[1:20:12] a closer walk with God. Somebody needs
[1:20:14] to realize I'm not here by accident.
[1:20:17] I've been put here by almighty God to
[1:20:20] serve a purpose.
[1:20:25] He said, "You are the people that's come
[1:20:28] here to be prayed for and that
[1:20:31] preparation was made for it. God forneew
[1:20:34] it." He said, "Well, that arouses that
[1:20:36] rouses the motions of my soul." And as
[1:20:39] you notice, the Holy Spirit when he
[1:20:40] takes the word, he sits across the
[1:20:42] congregation. Watch the emotions of the
[1:20:43] audience. You know what it do then? I
[1:20:45] know that that God's presence in the
[1:20:47] building. When you see it that way, the
[1:20:48] effect is moving on the people. Just the
[1:20:51] word God making preparations and
[1:20:53] providing the very thing you come to
[1:20:55] this tabernacle for, God forneew it, set
[1:20:58] it in order that you could receive the
[1:21:00] very thing you come for.
[1:21:04] Lord have mercy. We just going to say
[1:21:06] amen. Go home. God prepared.
[1:21:10] I'm going to push through this if I got
[1:21:12] to with that. My head, my feet, my head.
[1:21:14] I'm going to push through. Somebody
[1:21:15] gonna go with me.
[1:21:18] God allowed you. He prepared this
[1:21:21] service. He knew what demons of hell
[1:21:23] would try to sit here. He knew exactly
[1:21:25] what would try to cloud us and try to
[1:21:27] keep us from receiving something from
[1:21:28] God. But he knew somebody's going to get
[1:21:30] delivered. He knew somebody's going to
[1:21:32] break free. He knew somebody going to
[1:21:35] say, "Hey, I see my name in the book."
[1:21:39] Hallelujah. Amen. So therefore, he made
[1:21:42] the preparation already so you could
[1:21:45] receive what you came for.
[1:21:48] Come on, somebody. If you need healing,
[1:21:50] he's already made preparation for it. If
[1:21:53] you need salvation, he's already made
[1:21:55] preparation.
[1:21:59] God's already done it. It's set forth.
[1:22:02] God forneew it. And he set it in order
[1:22:04] that you can receive the very thing you
[1:22:07] came to receive. Did somebody come to
[1:22:09] receive something? So if you did, God
[1:22:12] made the preparation. He's got it here
[1:22:14] for you.
[1:22:19] Hallelujah. The very thing that you come
[1:22:21] to this place for, God's got it here for
[1:22:24] you. Everything's already set in order.
[1:22:26] The only thing you have to do is receive
[1:22:28] it. God's already sent it. The only
[1:22:32] thing you have to do is raise up and
[1:22:34] receive it. God's already sent it. Amen.
[1:22:40] Hallelujah. Amen. The eternal qualities.
[1:22:43] We were written in the lamb's book of
[1:22:45] life before the foundation of the world.
[1:22:47] That's Revelations
[1:22:50] 13:8. Amen. Ephesians 3:11 says, "We
[1:22:53] were part of God's eternal purpose." 1
[1:22:56] Peter 1:2 says, "We were elected
[1:22:59] according to the fornowledge of God the
[1:23:01] Father." Amen. 2 Timothy 1:9 says, "We
[1:23:04] were called with a holy calling, not
[1:23:06] according to our works, but by his
[1:23:08] purpose and grace."
[1:23:12] Maybe I'll read that in the amplified.
[1:23:14] For he delivered us and saved us and
[1:23:17] called us with a holy calling, a calling
[1:23:19] that leads to a consecrated life, a life
[1:23:22] that's set apart, a life that's here for
[1:23:24] a purpose,
[1:23:26] not because of our works or because of
[1:23:28] any personal merit. We could do nothing
[1:23:31] to earn this. We could do nothing to
[1:23:34] earn this. But because of his purpose
[1:23:36] and grace, his amazing undeserved favor
[1:23:40] which is granted us in Christ Jesus
[1:23:42] before the world began eternal ages ago.
[1:23:47] Lord, Colossians 1:26 says, "We are part
[1:23:51] of the mystery hidden from the ages and
[1:23:53] generation." Jeremiah 15 says, "Before I
[1:23:56] was formed in your womb, I knew you and
[1:23:59] approved of you as my chosen
[1:24:01] instrument."
[1:24:04] Glory to God. He knew there would be a
[1:24:06] devil on this earth. So, he had to have
[1:24:08] a chosen instrument. He knew there was a
[1:24:11] Goliath there that was going to
[1:24:13] challenge the armies of the living God.
[1:24:14] So, God made preparation for Goliath
[1:24:17] before he ever got there.
[1:24:19] Come on, somebody. He had a David that
[1:24:22] was prepared to meet Goliath before
[1:24:24] Goliath ever got there.
[1:24:27] Hallelujah. He had a chosen instrument
[1:24:30] for Goliath's demise. I'm telling you
[1:24:32] right now, God has seen cancer upon this
[1:24:35] earth, but he's got a chosen instrument.
[1:24:38] God has seen sin upon this earth, but
[1:24:40] he's got a chosen instrument. God has
[1:24:43] seen every demon of hell that would come
[1:24:45] against you. But he got you here and he
[1:24:48] made you and he put you in this place to
[1:24:50] be a chosen
[1:24:56] instrument. Galatians
[1:25:00] 15. Well, wait, wait, wait a minute. Let
[1:25:04] me finish Jeremiah 15. Before I formed
[1:25:07] you in the womb, I knew you and approved
[1:25:10] of you as my chosen instrument. And
[1:25:13] before you were born, I consecrated you
[1:25:17] to myself as my
[1:25:20] own before before Satan ever got to you.
[1:25:24] God already said that was mine.
[1:25:29] And no matter what Satan would do to
[1:25:30] you, he wouldn't change my God's mind
[1:25:32] about you. Ain't that something? Satan
[1:25:35] drugged some of y'all through hell,
[1:25:37] through every kind of ungodly life, some
[1:25:40] through hyp being a hypocrite,
[1:25:42] whatever. Pharisees,
[1:25:44] Sadducees, he done all kinds of stuff to
[1:25:47] people. But all he done didn't change
[1:25:50] God's mind.
[1:25:54] Oh my God. All that Satan had put in
[1:25:57] your life, all the scars that he put on
[1:26:00] you and the hurts and the pains and all
[1:26:03] the stuff and and even how you even
[1:26:05] maybe mangled up even your body and you
[1:26:07] don't even look all that. You may not be
[1:26:09] the first chosen on the team to play
[1:26:11] volleyball or basketball. It doesn't
[1:26:12] matter.
[1:26:15] God chose you. And Satan done all that
[1:26:18] to you. He done it to your body. He done
[1:26:20] it to your heart. He done it to your
[1:26:22] spirit. But God's mind never changed.
[1:26:27] He looked in that sin. He looked in that
[1:26:29] unbelief. He looked in them scars and he
[1:26:31] said, "I see myself. I see a son laying
[1:26:34] inside of there. And there ain't nothing
[1:26:36] the devil has done enough that is martyr
[1:26:39] enough. He hasn't marked you enough. He
[1:26:42] hasn't hurt you enough that God changes
[1:26:44] his mind about you. But he said, "That's
[1:26:47] mine. That one's mine. That one's mine.
[1:26:50] That one's mine."
[1:26:53] Hallelujah. I'm not changing my mind
[1:26:56] about you.
[1:27:02] Galatians 1:15 says, "But when God, who
[1:27:05] has chosen me and set me apart before I
[1:27:08] was born,
[1:27:13] and called me through his grace, was
[1:27:16] pleased." Oh my. God was
[1:27:20] pleased. He called me by his grace. But
[1:27:24] when it pleased God who separated me
[1:27:27] from my mother's womb, he called me by
[1:27:30] grace. In other words, before you ever
[1:27:35] went that was mine.
[1:27:39] Can you imagine the love that's in his
[1:27:40] heart? How many earthly fathers we got
[1:27:43] here today? Earthly mothers. First time
[1:27:45] you held
[1:27:49] them might have been ugly as homemade
[1:27:51] soap.
[1:27:57] I don't not trying to put no complex on
[1:27:59] nobody. I
[1:28:00] ain't might have been the most beautiful
[1:28:02] baby, but
[1:28:07] whatever. Man, he's handsome. Something
[1:28:10] happened. I I remember I I remember as a
[1:28:13] young 20some year old boy holding my
[1:28:16] little daughter Adriana for the first
[1:28:17] time. When I look down them eyes, the
[1:28:19] heart
[1:28:21] went never was the same since right. Any
[1:28:25] daddy's right? Any mama's right. When
[1:28:27] you held it, somehow mama has been she
[1:28:30] goes through such travail. But
[1:28:32] apparently there's enough love that
[1:28:33] overtakes her she forgets about it and
[1:28:35] she goes through it all over again.
[1:28:38] What is it? It's that love.
[1:28:41] And as a earthly father and we see this
[1:28:44] one who's going to go through things and
[1:28:45] we know they're going to have problems,
[1:28:47] make mistakes and we know they've been
[1:28:48] born in sin and shaping iniquity. We
[1:28:50] know we know these things and we see
[1:28:52] him. We're holding such love. But can
[1:28:54] you imagine what God must look when he
[1:28:57] sees you?
[1:29:01] God, I got so many mistakes. I got so
[1:29:03] many failures. I got I You know what he
[1:29:05] sees when he sees you? He sees himself.
[1:29:10] Hello.
[1:29:12] He sees himself.
[1:29:14] Oh, he might see a six foot six foot my
[1:29:17] foot. I wish 5 foot n at best
[1:29:27] on a good day
[1:29:30] when I'm hanging from
[1:29:35] something and I see all I see all my
[1:29:38] insufficiency. I I see all my flaws. I I
[1:29:41] see all that. But God doesn't see that.
[1:29:44] He looks and said, "It's my son.
[1:29:48] That's my That's my boy. He don't see
[1:29:51] all He don't see all the all the flaws
[1:29:53] that Satan put in like all the scars he
[1:29:55] put in my life and all the hurt. He sees
[1:29:58] himself.
[1:30:01] Oh, if we can only see ourselves as God
[1:30:03] sees us. Too many times. We're looking
[1:30:05] through the devil's eyes too many times
[1:30:07] and we see our faults and we see our
[1:30:08] flaws that he put there that he put upon
[1:30:11] our lives. But if we can for one moment
[1:30:13] see ourselves through the eyes of God,
[1:30:16] then God sees you as the unadulterated,
[1:30:20] unblenmished,
[1:30:22] without spot, without wrinkle. He sees
[1:30:26] himself.
[1:30:28] And it's himself he's looking at. He
[1:30:30] said, "That's my boy. That's my girl.
[1:30:32] I'm so proud of him." Amen. I'm so
[1:30:35] proud. He's walking in Satan's Eden. And
[1:30:37] yes, he may have fallen a few time, but
[1:30:39] look at him. He gets right back up
[1:30:41] again. Why? Because there's something on
[1:30:43] the inside of him. Amen. When that
[1:30:45] eternal seed is on the inside, you know,
[1:30:47] they want to make something about a
[1:30:49] Energizer Bunny is always going to Hey,
[1:30:52] it's more than some Energizer
[1:30:54] Bunny. Come on. I know. I went Some of
[1:30:59] y'all look at me. Where you going at
[1:31:00] now?
[1:31:02] That Energizer Bunny going to run
[1:31:06] out, be
[1:31:10] forgotten. Don't Don't act like you
[1:31:12] ain't never seen that
[1:31:14] commercial. Brother, we're in charity.
[1:31:16] We're not allowed to.
[1:31:19] No. What you talking about, brother?
[1:31:21] Energizer Bunny got Energizer batteries
[1:31:24] supposed to go on forever. How many has
[1:31:27] ever had some Energizer batteries that
[1:31:28] went on forever?
[1:31:31] No, no. They're constantly wearing down
[1:31:34] and falling apart. They're constantly
[1:31:36] being throwed in the trash
[1:31:39] because they're not eternal. I ain't
[1:31:41] talking to no Energizer bunnies here
[1:31:43] tonight.
[1:31:46] I'm not even talking to any
[1:31:47] nuclearpowered people.
[1:31:50] Yeah, they got nuclear power that'll
[1:31:52] power a ship for what, 30 years or
[1:31:54] whatever. That go forever seem like. But
[1:31:57] it ain't forever.
[1:31:59] It's only for a certain moment, a
[1:32:01] certain time. What I'm trying to tell
[1:32:03] you, what's on the inside of you is
[1:32:05] forever. It's eternal.
[1:32:08] It ain't going to wear out. It ain't
[1:32:10] going to fall apart. It ain't going to
[1:32:12] wear down. It ain't going to bow down to
[1:32:14] the devil and give up. It ain't going to
[1:32:15] stop aside and give itself to sin and
[1:32:18] unbelief. No. When it's been energized
[1:32:20] by the spirit of God and the Holy Spirit
[1:32:23] has quickened that life to that seed to
[1:32:25] life, it is eternal.
[1:32:33] 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse 9. For
[1:32:36] God has not destined us to incur his
[1:32:43] wrath. All right. Well, that's pretty
[1:32:45] good.
[1:32:51] God is not your destiny is not to to to
[1:32:54] to receive the wrath of God. Your
[1:32:58] destiny is to obtain salvation.
[1:33:04] This is what he said. For God has not
[1:33:06] destined us to incur his wrath. That is
[1:33:09] he did not select us to condemn
[1:33:13] [Music]
[1:33:15] us but to obtain salvation through our
[1:33:18] Lord Jesus. Amen. First 2 Thessalonians
[1:33:21] 2 and verse 13 says, "But we should and
[1:33:24] are morally obligated as debtors always
[1:33:26] to give thanks to God. For you
[1:33:28] believers, beloved of the Lord, because
[1:33:30] God has chosen you from the beginning
[1:33:32] for salvation through the sanctif
[1:33:34] sanctifying work of the spirit that sets
[1:33:37] you apart for God's purpose and by your
[1:33:40] faith in the truth of God's word that
[1:33:42] leads you to spiritual
[1:33:44] maturity." Amen. So God is your destiny.
[1:33:48] Amen. Even even we're destined to hear
[1:33:50] his voice and follow him. This is what
[1:33:52] he said in John 10 verse 27. The sheep
[1:33:55] that are on my own hear my voice and
[1:33:58] listen to me and I know them and they
[1:34:00] follow me and I give them eternal life
[1:34:03] and they will never ever by any means
[1:34:05] perish
[1:34:08] and no one will ever snatch them out of
[1:34:10] my hand.
[1:34:18] Jeremiah 31 says, "We were loved with an
[1:34:21] everlasting love, an eternal love."
[1:34:25] That's what he said. The Lord appeared
[1:34:27] to me, Israel, from ages past, saying,
[1:34:28] "I loved you with an everlasting love.
[1:34:32] Therefore, my loving kindness, I've
[1:34:34] drawn you and continued my faithfulness
[1:34:37] to you." We're given, we were given to
[1:34:39] the son by the father before the world
[1:34:41] ever began. This is what he said in John
[1:34:43] 17 and verse 5. Now Father, glorify me
[1:34:45] together with yourself with the glory
[1:34:47] and majesty that I had with you before
[1:34:49] the world existed. I have manifested
[1:34:52] your name and revealed your very self,
[1:34:54] your real self to the people whom you
[1:34:56] have given me out of the world. Out of
[1:34:59] the world and they are yours and you
[1:35:01] gave them to me and they have kept and
[1:35:03] obeyed your word. We were predestinated
[1:35:05] to be conformed into the image of his
[1:35:07] son is what Romans 8:29 musicians can
[1:35:10] come. Romans 8 29 for those whom he
[1:35:12] forneew and loved and chose beforehand.
[1:35:15] He has also predestinated to be
[1:35:17] conformed to the image of his son and
[1:35:19] ultimately share in his complete
[1:35:21] sanctification so that he would be the
[1:35:23] firstborn the most beloved and honored
[1:35:25] among many believers. And those who he
[1:35:27] predestinated he also called. And those
[1:35:30] whom he called he also justified thereby
[1:35:33] declared free of the guilt of sin. And
[1:35:35] those whom he justified, he has
[1:35:38] glorified, raising them to a heavenly
[1:35:41] dignity.
[1:35:44] Hallelujah. It's an eternal
[1:35:48] quality. It's not a temporary
[1:35:51] thing. The things your mom and dad
[1:35:54] passed down on to you through their
[1:35:56] physical bloodline is
[1:35:58] temporary. But what is placed on you
[1:36:00] before the foundation of the world is
[1:36:02] not temporary.
[1:36:04] is eternal. And this eternal
[1:36:08] seed overrides the temporary things.
[1:36:12] It's more powerful. It's greater. It has
[1:36:14] to. How can something that's not greater
[1:36:17] overcome something that's greater? We're
[1:36:20] talking about God here. We We look at
[1:36:22] armies sometimes. We say, "Well, how did
[1:36:24] this little army beat that big army?"
[1:36:26] And it can happen. But when it comes to
[1:36:28] God, that don't work no more. God's
[1:36:32] eternal. And that eternal seed he put on
[1:36:35] the inside of you is greater than
[1:36:37] anything the devil could ever do to you
[1:36:41] or has ever done to
[1:36:43] you. Maybe you just need to realize, you
[1:36:46] know, maybe my life didn't come the way
[1:36:48] I thought it should and I've always
[1:36:49] questioned why. Why was I born this way?
[1:36:52] Or why why was I put here? Why why was I
[1:36:56] adopted for? Why why why did I because
[1:37:00] God placed you in a place
[1:37:04] where that seed that was on the inside
[1:37:06] of you could meet that
[1:37:10] quickening. He knew the path that you
[1:37:12] was going to travel and he knew exactly
[1:37:15] where you had to be for him to find
[1:37:18] you. So quit asking all the wise about
[1:37:21] things and say, "God, I trust you. You
[1:37:25] got a greater
[1:37:27] plan. I trust you." How many can trust
[1:37:30] him tonight? Hallelujah. Stand together
[1:37:33] if we would bow your
[1:37:35] heads. So, Lord,
[1:37:37] I just want to thank you again. I want
[1:37:40] to give you
[1:37:41] thanks for Lord, you call me. You
[1:37:44] predestinated me to be a son, daughter
[1:37:47] of
[1:37:51] God. Lord,
[1:37:54] I think about what you've done for us,
[1:37:56] Lord.
[1:37:59] Seemingly sometimes we
[1:38:01] say he could have chose somebody else.
[1:38:03] But Lord, you couldn't choose anybody
[1:38:06] else. I was your
[1:38:09] son. These were your daughters. These
[1:38:11] were your sons. You had the It came from
[1:38:14] you. There wasn't no choosing anybody
[1:38:16] else. No different than I could choose
[1:38:18] somebody
[1:38:20] else that I wish I could have gave life
[1:38:23] to. No, they were ordained of God.
[1:38:27] Lord, it was ordained that Adriana and
[1:38:29] Luke and Andrew and Katie would come
[1:38:32] [Music]
[1:38:36] forth. Lord, it was ordained that
[1:38:39] Timothy and Aaron and Joe, Tim and vast
[1:38:45] audience, Lord, here even online, Lord,
[1:38:48] names that were written in the Lamb's
[1:38:49] book of life. They had to come
[1:38:52] forth. They had to come to
[1:38:55] fruition. Lord, devils have tried to
[1:38:57] stop them. Devils have tried to keep
[1:38:59] them bound. Devils have tried to hinder
[1:39:01] them. But Lord, all of a sudden, they
[1:39:04] meet that moment where that light
[1:39:06] strikes that seed and it comes to life.
[1:39:09] They realize, "Hey, I I never was a son
[1:39:12] of just a son of Tim and Karen Puit or I
[1:39:15] I never was a son of Satan. I never
[1:39:18] belonged to him. I whatever. I I belong
[1:39:21] to God. I I I see now who I really am
[1:39:24] and who I'm really called to be. Oh,
[1:39:26] what a blessed people we are. And we
[1:39:28] just want to say thank you, Lord.
[1:39:31] Thank you, Father, that we are your sons
[1:39:33] and daughters. And you had in you before
[1:39:36] the foundation of the world. And though
[1:39:39] Satan may have come with his tricks of
[1:39:41] his trade and tried to scar our lives
[1:39:43] and make us undesirable, but God, you
[1:39:46] couldn't turn down your sons and your
[1:39:48] daughters, never change your mind about
[1:39:50] us. You said that was mine. That was
[1:39:54] mine. Oh God, I thank you,
[1:39:57] Lord. Thank you,
[1:39:59] Father. Lord, we're looking forward to
[1:40:01] that time, Lord, that these bodies will
[1:40:04] change, Lord, to be part of that eternal
[1:40:07] creation. Oh, Jesus, may you meet each
[1:40:10] heart here tonight. Lord, we've had to
[1:40:12] struggle through storms and struggle
[1:40:14] through
[1:40:15] atmospheres. Lord, I I know you're here
[1:40:17] today, Father, and you made
[1:40:18] preparations.
[1:40:21] You made preparations for someone to
[1:40:23] receive what they came for.
[1:40:26] God, may you meet those needs. I pray.
[1:40:30] May they receive them right now in Jesus
[1:40:32] name. Lord, if they need healing, may
[1:40:34] they receive it. They need salvation,
[1:40:36] receive it, Lord. Need a closer walk,
[1:40:40] receive it. Need joy in their heart,
[1:40:42] receive it. Whatever, Lord, you made
[1:40:45] preparations for them. We praise you
[1:40:48] this evening in Jesus name.
[1:40:51] Amen.
[1:40:53] I know who I
[1:40:57] am cuz I know who you
[1:41:03] are. The cross of
[1:41:06] [Music]
[1:41:08] salvation was
