[38:10] father we commit it all into your hands
[38:13] now Lord in Jesus name we pray amen and
[38:17] amen
[38:18] amen amen if you have your Bibles and
[38:21] you'll turn with me to habac cook the
[38:24] second chapter we're going to read from
[38:27] the first
[38:28] verse amen it's it's good to be with you
[38:31] again we we missed on Sunday we we thank
[38:34] you so much for for all your prayers my
[38:37] my family was attacked with the with the
[38:40] flu and sickness and and uh I'm kind of
[38:44] just now back on my feet I'm I'm well
[38:46] don't worry about that but my body is
[38:48] still trying to gain back its strength
[38:50] if I get to to hacking up here well
[38:53] we'll be all right we'll get through it
[38:55] and you know brother Tim is not
[38:56] heartless I want you to know that he
[38:58] actually called me and said he'd be glad
[39:00] to take the service and I you know but
[39:02] like I told him I said look when you're
[39:04] only called upon every now and then it's
[39:06] kind of hard to call in sick it's like
[39:08] hey I I know you ain't needed me in a
[39:09] while but you're going to have to take
[39:10] this one too I said I just couldn't do
[39:13] that you know and and so I wanted to
[39:15] step up tonight and and and play my part
[39:18] amen I just pray that you'll bear with
[39:20] us we're doing well the family's well
[39:23] and we're thankful for that tonight amen
[39:25] amen Hab a cook too verse
[39:28] one in this first verse he says I will
[39:31] stand upon my watch and set me upon the
[39:35] tower and will watch to see what he will
[39:37] say unto me and what I shall answer when
[39:40] I am reproved and you know that that
[39:42] verse really stuck out to me and I know
[39:44] he's a prophet and he's speaking
[39:45] prophetically but we're also a prophetic
[39:47] class of people and I think that we
[39:49] ought to have this same attitude tonight
[39:51] Lord I'm going to stand upon my watch I
[39:54] I I'm going to I'm going to keep an open
[39:56] eye I'm I'm I I'm gonna pay attention to
[39:59] what's going on and and set me upon the
[40:01] tower I'm not going to be lack a daaco
[40:03] tonight Lord I'm not just going to sit
[40:05] by and let everybody else do the looking
[40:06] and everybody else do the watching but
[40:08] I'm going to do my watching and I'm
[40:09] going to watch and see what you're
[40:10] saying to me personally and I'm going to
[40:13] find how you're dealing in my life and
[40:15] my home so that I can answer Amen in
[40:18] verse two says and the Lord answered me
[40:20] and said write the vision and make it
[40:22] plain upon the tables that he may run
[40:25] that readeth it for the vision is yet
[40:27] for an appointed time but at the end it
[40:30] shall speak and not lie though it t wait
[40:34] for it because it will surely come it
[40:37] will not t amen I pray that the Lord
[40:40] will add his Blessing tonight as you
[40:42] have your seats
[40:44] and so with those things being said you
[40:46] just bear with me tonight maybe a
[40:48] different pace I'm not sure how how this
[40:51] will go and I don't plan to keep you
[40:53] long tonight but this is just kind of I
[40:56] guess what the Lord laid on my heart I
[40:57] I'll call it a New Year's message it's
[40:59] it's my first time to preach in the New
[41:01] Year 2025 and you we've just come into
[41:04] January and and I'm thankful that the
[41:07] Lord has brought us to another year I'm
[41:09] I'm thankful that that he has been with
[41:12] us and and I can say tonight that I
[41:14] found him faithful I I I found him to be
[41:17] true I you know I found the scripture to
[41:19] be true that many are the afflictions of
[41:21] the righteous but I've also found it to
[41:24] be true that he delivereth him out of
[41:26] them all all amen and and we stand here
[41:29] in a place that I figure many never
[41:32] expected to stand
[41:36] 2025 you know and what what we find is
[41:39] the devil the devil likes to use the
[41:41] passage of time as a way to bring in
[41:44] doubt and
[41:45] unbelief he uses the the passage of time
[41:49] as do you really think this could be
[41:51] because look how long it's been that
[41:53] promise was given thousands of years ago
[41:56] or hundreds of years years ago or even
[41:57] in the case of the message that prophecy
[41:59] went forth 70 years ago and he uses the
[42:03] passage of time to bring doubt and
[42:06] unbelief and confusion but I want us to
[42:08] kind of look at the passage of time a
[42:10] little different tonight as I was
[42:12] looking at this I thought you know the
[42:14] passage of time is only a countdown to
[42:17] fulfillment it's not going the wrong
[42:20] direction it's not oh no it's getting so
[42:22] long it it's counting the other
[42:23] direction it's counting Moment by moment
[42:26] and second by second second closer and
[42:28] closer to the Fulfillment so so it's a
[42:31] countdown tonight to the Fulfillment of
[42:34] the word of God Amen and and tonight as
[42:38] like I said as a New Year's message I
[42:39] kind of want to look a bit at at where
[42:41] we
[42:43] are what are we expecting and and what
[42:46] is our mindset going forward because
[42:50] what happens with the passage of time is
[42:53] is what we want to see in our own lives
[42:55] is that we get stronger and stronger as
[42:57] the days go by we' like to think another
[43:00] day is gone by and I've overcome so I've
[43:02] so I've gotten stronger in the faith and
[43:04] a and and I've grown stronger and and
[43:07] you know I want it to be to be said of
[43:09] us like it is of Abraham that who
[43:11] against hope believed in hope and being
[43:14] not weak in the faith he staggered not
[43:16] at the promise of God through unbelief
[43:18] but was strong in the faith and I want
[43:21] it to be said of my life and of evening
[43:23] light Tabernacle that in 2025 we're more
[43:26] determined than ever before we're more
[43:29] dedicated than ever before and more
[43:31] consecrated than ever before stronger
[43:34] than ever before excited just as the day
[43:37] when we first got
[43:39] saved but the truth is human nature is
[43:41] opposite of
[43:44] that the truth is that human nature is
[43:47] to relax the further we go
[43:50] along to let the guard down the further
[43:54] we go along and the further we go long
[43:57] the Gap should be widening between us
[44:00] and the things of the world and yet
[44:02] actually what you see is the gap
[44:06] narrowing whereas you should see more
[44:08] dedication to the house of God more
[44:10] dedication to prayer more dedication to
[44:12] reading your Bible you're seeing less
[44:15] dedication because time has passed time
[44:19] has has gone on and and and we get we
[44:21] get comfortable in our surroundings the
[44:24] longer that we remain in them and now
[44:27] combine human nature with the spirit of
[44:30] the age which is
[44:32] lukewarmness so it's already our nature
[44:35] to to to slack off as time goes on now
[44:38] you add that in with the fact that
[44:40] brother Brandon would talk about soft
[44:41] living and and and and easy lives
[44:44] compared to what's gone on in the past
[44:46] and then you see in Revelation three as
[44:48] Jesus would describe the age as as a
[44:50] lukewarm age that he's going to spew out
[44:53] of his mouth and and you combine those
[44:55] things together and we find our
[44:57] ourselves in a very dangerous
[45:00] place brother Tim referenced it on
[45:02] Sunday as he spoke about the condition
[45:05] of the message movement and just a few
[45:08] weeks back I'd been looking at a thought
[45:10] more than a
[45:14] movement and Revival and death has been
[45:18] constant through time it has never
[45:21] failed and it won't fail this
[45:24] time it's nothing new
[45:27] movements
[45:29] die that's what they do every movement
[45:31] down through time has died the Lutheran
[45:34] movement eventually lost Steam and died
[45:38] Wesley's movement eventually lost Steam
[45:40] and died the isusa movement lost Steam
[45:43] and died and if you look into movements
[45:46] of any kind whether it be a social
[45:48] movement or whether it be a religious
[45:51] movement what you'll find is the thing
[45:53] that brings success is unity
[45:59] and the thing that brings its downfall
[46:01] is power struggles and factionalism that
[46:04] erode that
[46:06] Unity things that come in and begin to
[46:09] draw the focus away from the goal and
[46:11] and and and people just begin to settle
[46:13] into their norms and settle into their
[46:15] traditions and well this is how we do it
[46:18] and this is how I see it and this is how
[46:20] my pastor believes it and more energy
[46:23] begins to be put into internal struggles
[46:26] than to prog pressing further down the
[46:29] road different ideas different
[46:32] viewpoints begin to raise up and over
[46:35] time people begin to dig in on which way
[46:38] they see it and it becomes a Creed and
[46:41] it becomes a dividing
[46:44] line well we see it this way oh that's
[46:47] the way your church sees it and and
[46:49] pretty soon what ends up happening is it
[46:52] a disassociation of
[46:54] fellowship and well we don't really
[46:55] fellowship with them because they
[46:57] believe this and we don't fellowship
[46:59] with them because they see this this way
[47:01] and it dies right
[47:03] there it becomes faction and and
[47:06] denomination is what it is and God hates
[47:11] it and sure maybe the name goes on and
[47:14] on and
[47:15] on there Still Remains if you look
[47:18] around you can find
[47:20] lutherans and there's still remains of
[47:23] of of the life that was in Wesley there
[47:26] are Pentecost churches all over the
[47:29] place Louisiana has Pentecostal churches
[47:33] everywhere living a
[47:35] name but they're
[47:39] dead they're
[47:41] dead so what I'm saying to you
[47:45] tonight isn't that there's anything
[47:47] wrong with the message what I'm saying
[47:49] you tonight is make sure that you're in
[47:51] more than a
[47:53] movement make sure that you've been
[47:55] caught up to to more than a movement but
[47:57] make sure that the life that stirred
[47:59] that movement to begin with the life
[48:02] that fanned the Flames to begin with
[48:04] that that life is on the inside of you
[48:08] tonight make sure it's not just a
[48:11] movement but the life behind the
[48:13] movement has gotten down on the inside
[48:15] of you it's not so important tonight
[48:18] whether or not you can answer the
[48:19] question are you in the
[48:21] message but can you answer the question
[48:24] is the message in you
[48:29] that's the difference that's what we're
[48:30] looking for not not just I abide by a
[48:33] set of rules and I live life a certain
[48:35] way and I believe God sent a prophet
[48:37] that those things are wonderful but
[48:39] that's part of the
[48:40] movement but we're going to stand here
[48:42] and Shout what we've always shouted have
[48:45] you been born again have you been filled
[48:48] with the spirit of almighty God have you
[48:51] met him face to face for
[48:54] yourself that's the question
[48:57] because the life that was in Luther
[48:59] didn't die the movement
[49:03] died the life carried on for the to the
[49:06] to the furtherance of restoration and
[49:08] the life that was in Wesley didn't die
[49:11] the life carried
[49:13] on and so on with the Zeo of the life
[49:17] didn't die the movement
[49:19] died to where we end up standing
[49:22] today and the the movement may die away
[49:26] but the light life of this message will
[49:28] not die make sure that you know the one
[49:31] behind the message make sure you know
[49:33] the life of the message amen then it
[49:36] won't matter what happens to the
[49:38] movement it won't matter who falls away
[49:41] this church can fail that church can
[49:43] fail this friend can fall away you won't
[49:46] fade away because that life is eternal
[49:50] life
[49:52] amen then you're not anchored to a
[49:55] movement you aren't anchored to a
[49:57] theology or anchored to a Doctrine
[49:59] you're anchored to the solid rock and
[50:02] that Rock tonight is Jesus Christ amen
[50:05] this message tonight is Jesus Christ
[50:08] many times we confuse the message with
[50:11] the
[50:12] movement or we confuse the message with
[50:14] with what men have made out of it or
[50:16] what men say it is or what men build
[50:19] with the message and what men do with
[50:22] the message will fail and what men say
[50:24] the message is will fail and and what
[50:26] men lift up as the message it may fail
[50:28] but Jesus Christ the word of God the
[50:31] message of the hour it can never
[50:35] fail the message cannot fail because the
[50:38] word cannot
[50:40] fail amen this message is
[50:44] Christ and Christ cannot fail it's an
[50:47] unfailing word that we have tonight amen
[50:50] it doesn't matter about the passage of
[50:52] time it doesn't matter how long that we
[50:55] have to wait the word cannot fail we can
[50:59] anchor Our Lives to that
[51:01] tonight and so we stand here tonight
[51:04] facing another year
[51:05] 2025 and I asked you what are you
[51:08] anchored to
[51:10] tonight hopefully not evening like
[51:14] Tabernacle hopefully not to the family
[51:16] you were born in or how good mama is or
[51:18] how good daddy is or or that you believe
[51:22] the
[51:23] message but you got to be anchored that
[51:27] the life of Jesus Christ is on the
[51:29] inside of
[51:30] you you got to be anchored that you know
[51:33] that you know that you know that you
[51:35] know because we're staring at another
[51:38] year another Milestone the passage of
[51:40] time
[51:42] and looking at all the time that has
[51:44] gone by and it it seems sometimes like
[51:47] things will just go on
[51:51] forever it seems like nothing's
[51:54] happening
[51:56] and the attitude becomes exactly what it
[51:58] said there in second
[52:00] Peter 2 Peter 3 and 3 it says knowing
[52:05] this first that there shall come in the
[52:07] last day scoffers walking after their
[52:10] own lust and saying where is the promise
[52:13] of his
[52:14] coming for since the fathers fell asleep
[52:17] all things continue as they were from
[52:20] the beginning of the
[52:24] creation and with that attitude ude
[52:27] comes a level of
[52:29] comfort things are how they've always
[52:32] been sure I'm a
[52:33] Believer yeah but I mean nothing's
[52:35] changed I'm I'm 18 and I've been hearing
[52:38] the same message for 18 years and it
[52:40] seems about the same now as it was
[52:43] then I'm 40 and they've been saying the
[52:46] coming of the Lord I me I believe I
[52:48] believe but who knows it may not even be
[52:50] in my lifetime maybe it's
[52:52] later but things are just like they've
[52:54] always been and you fall into a level of
[52:58] comfort to where you don't have the same
[53:02] anticipation when you gather together in
[53:04] the house of God you don't expect the
[53:07] miraculous quite the same you don't
[53:08] expect his appearing quite like you did
[53:11] you don't have the same vigilence or the
[53:13] urgency that we once
[53:15] had and none of us none of us would ever
[53:19] say that we don't believe he's
[53:22] coming none of us would ever say that
[53:24] that we don't believe that it's any day
[53:26] oh sure it's any day now yeah
[53:29] absolutely but our lack of urgency and
[53:31] our lack of vigilance would
[53:33] indicate that his coming is not Upon
[53:38] Us did you live today as if his coming
[53:42] was
[53:44] tonight do you live I'm not saying do
[53:47] you say because I believe we would all
[53:49] say but does the urgency of our life
[53:52] does the urgency of our walk does it
[53:54] indicate that we believe that
[53:59] because we can say what we want but our
[54:01] lives indicate to him how we truly
[54:04] feel how much we believe our lack of
[54:08] urgency and our lack of vigilance would
[54:11] say we have plenty of
[54:15] time and now if nothing else just allow
[54:17] me to preach this to myself because this
[54:19] is what the Lord laid on my heart for me
[54:21] and my life going into
[54:24] 2025 because the secret of his
[54:27] coming is the beauty of the
[54:30] Gospel in that it's set up in a way that
[54:34] you have to be ready because you don't
[54:38] know but let me tell you like this even
[54:40] if that wasn't a secret even if God came
[54:42] down and spoke and revealed tonight my
[54:45] coming is in the year 20
[54:47] 240 that has nothing to do with
[54:50] you and when you're going to meet God
[54:57] and the Lord's just been dealing with
[54:59] with me and are you living as if it's
[55:02] today are you giving everything you
[55:05] [Music]
[55:06] can and and as you examine your life and
[55:09] you and you put it up with the mirror of
[55:11] the word you have to be willing to admit
[55:14] the places you have fallen short and
[55:17] it's not that he's condemning you he's
[55:18] saying there's more for you there's a
[55:21] deeper walk there's a greater experience
[55:24] there's more unfolding I've I've got
[55:26] more for you than I've ever had
[55:30] before and he's just waiting on you to
[55:33] take that
[55:34] step waiting on you to take that extra
[55:37] step to give a little bit
[55:38] more because the Cry Of My Heart Tonight
[55:41] is don't be rocked to
[55:43] sleep don't get comfortable here because
[55:47] the vision is for an appointed time and
[55:50] it shall not
[55:53] lie the cogs of God's word have never
[55:56] stop grinding and although it seems
[55:59] sometimes to T the word will come to
[56:05] pass we're preaching tonight about the
[56:07] cogs the grinding of the
[56:10] cogs they never
[56:13] stop they never stop turning even if we
[56:16] think everything's the same they've
[56:19] turned and if they've turned the gears
[56:21] have
[56:23] moved you can sit here and look at that
[56:25] clock and that minute hand don't seem to
[56:27] be moving but inside the cogs are
[56:30] turning and just ask a preacher you look
[56:32] up in a minute and it's been
[56:34] moving even though you can't see it you
[56:38] look around and all things are the same
[56:40] brother and all things are the same
[56:41] they're not the same the cogs are
[56:43] turning we're getting closer and we're
[56:45] getting closer we're closer now than
[56:47] we've ever been before and I say that
[56:49] the time is upon us now to make sure
[56:52] make your calling an election sure go
[56:55] beyond I'm in the message go beyond I I
[56:58] gave my heart to the Lord 30 years ago
[56:59] wonderful wonderful but make sure
[57:01] tonight that you know that you
[57:04] know because the cogs are steadily
[57:08] turning every
[57:10] promise and every
[57:13] prophecy has a place now I want you to
[57:16] get this because like I said the devil
[57:17] likes to come in with time and the
[57:19] passage of time and it's
[57:24] 2025 y'all thought y'all have been out
[57:26] here in the 70s y'all thought y'all have
[57:28] been out here in the
[57:29] 80s y'all thought it'd be evil too evil
[57:32] in that and here you are
[57:35] 2025 but every promise and every
[57:37] prophecy has a
[57:39] place just picture this now where the
[57:42] Eternal Word and time
[57:47] intersect where the Eternal Word and
[57:50] time
[57:52] intersects and at that place of
[57:54] intersection is
[57:57] fulfillment where the prophecy
[58:00] intersects with time and we know time is
[58:03] is like a a straight line and and and we
[58:06] even know that you know brother brandham
[58:08] could could go back on that line to a
[58:10] place and see something that happened in
[58:12] someone's life and tell them we're
[58:15] standing here today because this
[58:17] happened on this line but then he could
[58:19] speak a word that would land further
[58:22] down the line and say I'll shake your
[58:24] hand outside of the blue board
[58:26] restaurant now that would travel along
[58:28] in eternity while he traveled along in
[58:31] time but there come a place there come a
[58:34] point where the eternity and the time
[58:36] would intersect once again and at that
[58:39] intersection what you'll find is
[58:41] fulfillment amen and Satan will do
[58:44] everything he can to keep you from
[58:47] realizing that fulfillment is upon you
[58:50] to keep you from recognizing that you're
[58:52] right at the place of fulfillment to
[58:54] keep you distracted and to make sure
[58:57] that you're seeing the trouble all
[58:58] around and make sure you're seeing the
[59:00] faults and the issues so that as you
[59:03] approach that
[59:05] intersection the intersection catches
[59:07] You by
[59:10] surprise the Lord has done everything in
[59:13] this day to make sure that doesn't
[59:15] happen he's gone to

[59:41] service that you move in a mighty way

[59:52] matter how long ago the promise was
[59:54] given there's an appointed time for the
[59:56] Fulfillment of all things and we are
[59:59] grinding towards that
[1:00:03] moment we're coming towards that
[1:00:07] intersection Genesis
[1:00:10] 18:14 says is anything too hard for the
[1:00:13] Lord at the time
[1:00:16] appointed I will return unto thee
[1:00:18] according to the time of life and Sarah
[1:00:20] shall have a son I just got several of
[1:00:22] these in here so you understand
[1:00:24] everything has a time appointed

[1:00:34] on for my I've been sick a long time and
[1:00:37] I've been battling at the time appointed
[1:00:39] he's going to return to you for all his
[1:00:42] promises there is a time
[1:00:46] appointed Daniel
[1:00:48] 8:19 and he said behold I will make thee
[1:00:51] know what shall be in the last end of
[1:00:54] the indignation for at the time
[1:00:56] appointed the end shall be oh listen

[1:01:05] going to be a Rapture there is a day
[1:01:08] that a time appointed the end shall be
[1:01:12] acts
[1:01:14] 7:17 and when the time of the promise
[1:01:17] Drew
[1:01:18] nigh which God had swarmed to Abraham
[1:01:21] the people grew and multiplied in
[1:01:23] Egypt verse 18 Till till another king
[1:01:26] arose which knew not Joseph when did
[1:01:30] this happen when the time of the promise
[1:01:35] Drew

[1:01:39] see it's been so long it's been so long
[1:01:41] and we're going devil it's just counting
[1:01:43] down it's just counting down as an
[1:01:45] eternal being devil I'm not worried
[1:01:47] about it you should be the one worried
[1:01:49] with how long it's taken because you
[1:01:52] have a limited amount of time I do not
[1:01:55] I'm an eternal being I'm not worried
[1:01:57] about how long God said it that settles
[1:02:00] it that's my anchor I don't care if it's
[1:02:02] 2020 20201 22 23 24 or 25 I'm anchored
[1:02:08] in an eternal
[1:02:11] word
[1:02:15] hallelujah brother Aaron is 2025 I I
[1:02:18] thought surely by
[1:02:20] now brother Aaron if this were all true
[1:02:23] how
[1:02:24] come listen there is not one thing out
[1:02:27] of cater
[1:02:29] tonight there isn't one thing going
[1:02:33] wrong the Fulfillment of the word and
[1:02:36] the Rapture of the church is right on
[1:02:39] schedule and it's as true tonight as
[1:02:41] it's ever
[1:02:42] been the word is true tonight I know we
[1:02:45] live in an age and the world wants us to
[1:02:47] doubt everything and it's a scientific
[1:02:49] age trying to prove everything wrong but
[1:02:51] tonight the word is true his promises
[1:02:53] are true they are Eternal they cannot
[1:02:56] fail they were true back then they were
[1:02:58] true in brother bram's day they'll be
[1:03:00] true tomorrow and they'll be true all
[1:03:01] through
[1:03:03] 2025 God's word is the truth
[1:03:06] tonight his promises are true and the
[1:03:10] cogs grind continuously
[1:03:13] on prophet of God says now therefore
[1:03:15] let's go back now and get the beginning
[1:03:18] and find out how sure this word is now
[1:03:22] bear this in mind and as we glean
[1:03:24] Through the Bible you'll see that the
[1:03:26] cogs of God's will turn slow but sure it
[1:03:31] may look like it's a million miles away
[1:03:34] but she's grinding right up there all
[1:03:36] the time and one of these days it'll be
[1:03:39] here no matter
[1:03:42] what he says the people begin to get
[1:03:45] ready taskmasters beating children slain
[1:03:49] the hour of the cogs of God's prophetic
[1:03:51] will had ground up to the time listen I
[1:03:54] want you to get this I believe they've
[1:03:56] ground up to it again I believe we're
[1:04:00] here that's the reason I think that
[1:04:02] things are the way they are now the old
[1:04:05] prophetic clocks ticked right up to
[1:04:07] nearly the Zero
[1:04:11] Hour don't let the devil convince you
[1:04:16] otherwise excuse me we're at the Zero
[1:04:23] Hour young people I know
[1:04:27] what it's like to feel like you got
[1:04:31] forever and you wake
[1:04:33] up and you're
[1:04:38] 44 I celebrated my brother's 50th
[1:04:40] birthday
[1:04:44] yesterday man right now I can go back in
[1:04:46] my mind playing football in the yard
[1:04:48] with
[1:04:48] him we was kids
[1:04:53] yesterday and to some of you you kind of
[1:04:55] chuckle at that but the old ones know
[1:04:57] what I mean we was kids
[1:05:00] yesterday happens like
[1:05:03] that you don't have forever we're at the
[1:05:06] zero hour and I want to say it again
[1:05:10] even if there was another 20 30 40 years
[1:05:13] what's that mean to
[1:05:15] you you're not promised tomorrow make it
[1:05:19] count
[1:05:20] tonight give him every moment of your
[1:05:23] life cuz the devil will come and
[1:05:25] convince we got plenty of time oh it's
[1:05:27] not as bad as they say
[1:05:29] and I remember one
[1:05:32] time it's funny how you hear through
[1:05:34] different ears there was a prodal in the
[1:05:38] service years ago and I was serving the
[1:05:40] lord he wasn't he had not been there in
[1:05:42] years and he was in a
[1:05:44] service and I met him afterwards you
[1:05:47] know
[1:05:48] and I was going to reinforce what had
[1:05:51] been said from the pull pit I said you
[1:05:53] know I know we heard a lot today about
[1:05:55] how bad things are and I was going to
[1:05:58] say but it's probably even worse than
[1:06:00] what we
[1:06:01] realize but he cut me off and said yeah
[1:06:04] they're not near that bad are
[1:06:07] they and I thought we're hearing through
[1:06:11] different
[1:06:11] filters we're seeing the world through
[1:06:13] different
[1:06:15] filters one of us has been convinced
[1:06:17] that there's plenty of
[1:06:19] time one of us has been convinced that
[1:06:21] we're not right here on the edge of the
[1:06:23] coming of the Lord but I want you to
[1:06:25] know tonight that we are living in the
[1:06:27] season of
[1:06:30] change you know Seasons blend fall
[1:06:34] Blends in into
[1:06:36] winter winter Blends into spring there
[1:06:38] there's signs of spring you may walk
[1:06:40] outside and it still feels like winter
[1:06:41] and you got to have a coat on but you
[1:06:43] can see days are getting a little longer
[1:06:45] and there's some green Buds and it's not
[1:06:48] spring but it's
[1:06:50] blending I believe with all my heart
[1:06:52] Time and Eternity have already begun to
[1:06:54] blend I'm still looking around I'm
[1:06:56] seeing a lot of winter I'm seeing a lot
[1:06:58] of death I'm seeing a lot of this world
[1:07:00] but there's signs all around me that say
[1:07:02] the Son of God is coming the sun is
[1:07:05] coming up we're blending into eternity
[1:07:07] the seasons are blending it's the season
[1:07:09] of change our bodies are getting ready
[1:07:11] to be changed forever there's signs of
[1:07:14] it and you know it's coming even before
[1:07:17] you can actually declare that the season
[1:07:19] has
[1:07:20] changed and as you approach an
[1:07:23] intersection if you're paying attention
[1:07:26] there are signs letting you know that
[1:07:28] you're approaching an
[1:07:30] intersection slow
[1:07:32] down pay attention stop ahead caution
[1:07:37] ahead whatever the sign may be but it
[1:07:40] gives you a heads up that the
[1:07:42] intersection is
[1:07:44] coming if you're paying attention you'll
[1:07:46] see these caution ahead and I say
[1:07:48] tonight that the signs are all around us
[1:07:51] that there's an intersection just
[1:07:54] ahead there is an intersection just
[1:07:57] ahead where time once again and the
[1:07:59] prophecy are going to intersect and
[1:08:01] there's going to be fulfillment we're
[1:08:03] right here approaching another
[1:08:05] intersection and I say tonight get
[1:08:07] focused pay attention slow down Time and
[1:08:11] Eternity are
[1:08:13] blending the time of the promise is
[1:08:15] drawing nigh what signs brother Aaron
[1:08:19] what are you seeing as it was in the
[1:08:21] days of Noah as it was in the days of
[1:08:24] lot
[1:08:25] the Bible tells us in the last days
[1:08:27] perilous time shall come signs are you
[1:08:31] not seeing the same signs that I'm
[1:08:34] seeing lovers of themselves Covetous
[1:08:36] boasters proud blasphemers disobedient
[1:08:39] unthankful Unholy without natural
[1:08:41] affection truce Breakers false accusers
[1:08:43] incontinent Fierce despisers of those
[1:08:46] that are good traitors heady high-m
[1:08:48] minded lovers of pleasure more than
[1:08:50] lovers of
[1:08:52] God signs
[1:08:56] I'll give you another one here's a sign
[1:08:59] brother brandom 1965 let me prophesy
[1:09:02] something to you just before it comes to
[1:09:04] pass the whole world is groping in
[1:09:06] insanity and it will get worse and worse
[1:09:09] and worse until there'll be a bunch of
[1:09:12] Maniacs just saw that one go
[1:09:15] by we're
[1:09:21] there
[1:09:22] signs there's an intersection just ahead
[1:09:26] slow down pay attention lock in
[1:09:29] refocus there's an intersection just
[1:09:32] ahead well brother Aon another year pass
[1:09:35] and nothing happened wake
[1:09:38] up a lot has happened and a lot is
[1:09:42] happening there's an intersection just
[1:09:44] ahead where time is going to intersect
[1:09:46] with the prophecy and someone is going
[1:09:49] to be changed in a moment and a
[1:09:51] twinkling of an eye that's where we're
[1:09:53] at that's the Fulfillment that's the
[1:09:55] junction of time where we stand that
[1:09:58] prophecy is't just going to float around
[1:10:00] out there forever and ever and ever but
[1:10:02] there comes a point where it comes down
[1:10:04] and intersects with time and we step
[1:10:07] into eternity and our immort our
[1:10:09] mortality then puts on
[1:10:14] immortality brother BR says now before
[1:10:16] that could take place which God had said
[1:10:19] God had to have this nation ready he had
[1:10:21] to have the people ready and then he had
[1:10:23] to have Moses ready to go to go down
[1:10:26] there God makes everything work together
[1:10:29] right just like cogs coming together we
[1:10:33] see it off sometime in the distance and
[1:10:35] wonder could it ever be but it always
[1:10:38] happens just the way God said it
[1:10:40] would and when the time of the promise
[1:10:43] Drew nigh there come a pharaoh who did
[1:10:45] not know Joseph and then at the same
[1:10:48] time of the persecution and killing of
[1:10:50] the little children God sent Moses a
[1:10:52] Prophet come on the scene and miracles
[1:10:54] and signs begin to happen in the age
[1:10:57] because the time of the age was
[1:11:00] finished there come a time where the
[1:11:02] Hebrew children had to make a stand
[1:11:04] whether they're going to bow down to a
[1:11:06] heathen image or whether they're going
[1:11:07] to keep their faith in the same true
[1:11:10] Living God the time came where the
[1:11:12] decision must be made and they made the
[1:11:15] right decision and God was with them I
[1:11:19] believe that's where we stand tonight
[1:11:22] that it's decisionmaking time the time
[1:11:25] has has come the time has come tonight
[1:11:27] evening like Tabernacle to cast down
[1:11:29] doubt and unbelief the time has come to
[1:11:32] stand against the fears that consume our
[1:11:34] homes and consume Our Lives the time has
[1:11:37] come to stand against the things that
[1:11:39] divide us to stand for truth to stand
[1:11:42] for Unity to stand for the word of God
[1:11:45] the time has come for each and every one
[1:11:46] of us to go further with God than we've
[1:11:49] ever gone before not to stop short and
[1:11:52] make a decision are we going to continue
[1:11:54] in 2025 as halfway lukewarm Believers
[1:11:58] that get spewed out of his mouth when
[1:11:59] time and prophecy intersect are we going
[1:12:02] to go all the way in be on fire for God
[1:12:05] sold out I say make the right decision
[1:12:07] tonight stand up and be counted and say
[1:12:10] as for me and my house we're going to
[1:12:13] serve the Lord with all of our heart
[1:12:16] make the right
[1:12:18] decision go all
[1:12:20] in I'm not going to Coast through 2025
[1:12:25] caught up in the
[1:12:27] lukewarmness caught up in the haze of
[1:12:29] the
[1:12:32] age missing what God is doing you can
[1:12:35] sit here every single service and Miss
[1:12:37] what God's
[1:12:40] doing he can be moving all around
[1:12:46] you and you miss what God's
[1:12:50] doing callous to his voice
[1:12:58] callous to his
[1:12:59] moving man we never get like that little
[1:13:02] boy brother brand talked about in the 10
[1:13:04] cent
[1:13:05] store said his mama was going around and
[1:13:09] finding all these things and shaking it
[1:13:11] in front of him he just stared off in
[1:13:13] the
[1:13:14] distance she began to scream and people
[1:13:16] came like what's the matter it was just
[1:13:18] like he was in a trance nothing would
[1:13:19] get his attention the things that should
[1:13:22] attract a little boy and she'd shake it
[1:13:23] and he'd just stare and she'd shake it
[1:13:26] and he'd just
[1:13:27] stare and nothing that nothing that she
[1:13:30] would do would get his attention nothing
[1:13:32] would grab a hold of
[1:13:35] him don't get to the place where nothing
[1:13:37] moves
[1:13:40] us where Nothing grabs our attention

[1:14:08] handed out has preached to
[1:14:11] us how dare us get to a place where it
[1:14:14] doesn't attract
[1:14:15] us to where we aren't impressed by the
[1:14:18] word in our
[1:14:19] midst God has shook so much and we've
[1:14:22] heard so much and we've seen so much

[1:17:47] for Mighty outpourings of the spirit I'm
[1:17:49] coming to church with Great Expectations
[1:17:52] I'm going to have victory in 202 five
[1:17:55] like I've never had before I'm going
[1:17:57] into this year going it's going to be
[1:17:59] wonderful it's going to be Mighty it's
[1:18:02] going to be
[1:18:03] awesome that's what I'm looking
[1:18:08] for because God's word is going to be
[1:18:12] fulfilled his promises are going to come
[1:18:14] to pass they canot fail Satan can't stop
[1:18:20] it and despite what some of y'all think
[1:18:23] who get all caught up in it
[1:18:26] politics can't stop
[1:18:29] it Joe Biden can't stop
[1:18:32] it Donald Trump can't stop
[1:18:38] it that man says some wild stuff
[1:18:43] y'all I try not to pay no attention but
[1:18:46] now Canada is a 51st
[1:18:48] state and we're going to get Greenland
[1:18:50] or something like that I Panama
[1:18:55] I'm like man can we just get our taxes
[1:18:57] lowered before we start Conquering the
[1:19:01] world man's
[1:19:04] wild but they can't stop
[1:19:07] it we have to get to the place that we
[1:19:09] realize that they're all just
[1:19:11] Pawns in the hand of God as bad as
[1:19:15] people thought Obama was Pawn only able
[1:19:18] to do what God allowed him to do as bad
[1:19:21] as people thought Joe Biden was he was
[1:19:24] but he's a pawn on in the hand of God
[1:19:27] listen imagine I imagine all the politic
[1:19:29] followers back in Jesus day sat around
[1:19:31] and did all kind of griping about Caesar
[1:19:34] when he said they had to go back and be
[1:19:36] taxed they sat around and griped and
[1:19:39] moaned and said why does Rome have to
[1:19:42] control
[1:19:43] everything why does Rome dictate what
[1:19:46] goes on on this Earth not no in Rome
[1:19:49] didn't have one single thing to do with
[1:19:52] it God moved upon him to fulfill
[1:19:55] his word because his word has to be
[1:19:58] fulfilled so God said send them back to
[1:20:00] their home to be taxed because I got a
[1:20:03] savior coming and he's going to be born
[1:20:05] in a certain place and I'm going to move
[1:20:07] the pawns where I want to move the pawns
[1:20:10] to fulfill my word he's just getting us
[1:20:13] where he wants us so he can take us home
[1:20:18] church quit given so much credit to all
[1:20:22] these idiots
[1:20:28] what a hardship all the traveling and
[1:20:30] all the griping and yet God's cogs were
[1:20:35] grinding brother Brown says now in these
[1:20:37] days there was great persecution of the
[1:20:40] church Caesar Augusta had made a great
[1:20:43] plan that he would tax all the people
[1:20:46] and that was only done for one purpose
[1:20:50] that God's Great prophecy would be
[1:20:54] fulfilled
[1:20:57] what is it brother Aaron
[1:21:00] time intersected with the word and there
[1:21:04] was a season of
[1:21:06] fulfillment Time After Time prophecy
[1:21:09] after prophecy I want to go through a
[1:21:11] few of them here just so we begin to
[1:21:14] understand that time doesn't
[1:21:15] matter Isaiah
[1:21:18] 7:14 therefore the Lord himself shall
[1:21:21] give you a sign Behold a ver virgin
[1:21:24] shall conceive and bear a son and shall
[1:21:28] call his name Emmanuel that laid there
[1:21:31] for over 700
[1:21:33] years but there came a time of
[1:21:38] intersection Micah 5 and two but thou
[1:21:41] Bethlehem
[1:21:43] euphrat though thou be little among the
[1:21:46] thousands of Judah yet out of thee shall
[1:21:48] come forth unto me that is to be the
[1:21:50] ruler in Israel whose goings forth have
[1:21:53] been from old from
[1:21:56] Everlasting that's why the
[1:21:59] tax it had to be
[1:22:02] Bethlehem Isaiah 53
[1:22:06] and5 but he was wounded for our
[1:22:10] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:22:13] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:22:15] was upon him and with his
[1:22:18] stripes we are
[1:22:21] healed and this is one that has multiple
[1:22:25] contacts with the
[1:22:27] timeline it laid there forever until
[1:22:31] Time and Eternity came together and he
[1:22:32] took a
[1:22:33] beating and then it continues to lay
[1:22:36] there until my timeline needs it and it
[1:22:38] comes in contact with it and then your
[1:22:40] timeline needs it and it comes in
[1:22:42] contact with it and then your timeline
[1:22:43] needs it and it comes in contact with it
[1:22:45] and time after time there's an
[1:22:47] intersection with the time being and an
[1:22:49] eternal word and it intersects once
[1:22:51] again and there's healing and there's
[1:22:53] Deliverance because it's an eternal word
[1:22:56] that comes in contact Time After
[1:22:59] Time with the timeline of
[1:23:02] humanity Psalms
[1:23:05] 22:17 I may tell all my
[1:23:09] bones they look and stare upon
[1:23:14] me who
[1:23:16] knew all those years later he would hang
[1:23:19] on the
[1:23:21] cross and they could stare at his bones
[1:23:25] and this would come in contact with time
[1:23:26] and an eternal word there would be a
[1:23:28] spark and there'd be
[1:23:30] fulfillment Eternal words that had an
[1:23:32] appointment in
[1:23:34] time it does not matter how long it
[1:23:37] takes once the word is released it is a
[1:23:41] seed
[1:23:44] sewn it is a seed sewn and every seed
[1:23:48] brings forth of its
[1:23:52] kind so when you release a the seed of
[1:23:55] healing and put it in the ground prepare
[1:23:57] for a harvest of healing you release the
[1:24:00] seed of Salvation it's going to work
[1:24:02] salvation you release a seed of
[1:24:04] Deliverance if it's from the word it's
[1:24:05] going to produce a harvest of
[1:24:08] Deliverance
[1:24:10] amen and that seed that goes forth is
[1:24:14] going to bring forth every single time
[1:24:18] because it can't fail that's what I'm
[1:24:19] trying to get to you tonight don't be
[1:24:21] discouraged don't get disillusioned it's
[1:24:23] as failing tonight as it's ever been
[1:24:27] it's just as sure tonight as it's ever
[1:24:29] been brother Brown says if you believe
[1:24:31] this to be God's Eternal unchangeable
[1:24:34] Word then every precept that's been
[1:24:36] spoke in God's word is a seed and
[1:24:39] everything that God has spoke of in the
[1:24:41] word is already confirmed in glory and
[1:24:43] it's been given to you to act upon so
[1:24:46] don't be afraid to take any phrase any
[1:24:48] phase of God's Eternal blessed word and
[1:24:52] anchor it in your heart he says there's
[1:24:54] where reason I believe in that word and
[1:24:57] I believe that the word is a seed and if
[1:24:59] that seed is sewed in the right ground
[1:25:01] and watered by the Holy Spirit it will
[1:25:03] bring forth of its kind any promise that
[1:25:06] God made God will do it
[1:25:11] amen what are you saying tonight brother
[1:25:14] and what's your New Year's message I'm
[1:25:15] saying lock in tonight refocus tonight
[1:25:19] because it doesn't matter how long it's
[1:25:20] been it doesn't matter how long ago you
[1:25:22] planted it there are some seeds that you
[1:25:24] have planted that you are getting ready
[1:25:26] to harvest in 2025 there are some things
[1:25:29] about to come up you may not even
[1:25:31] remember it's there because you planted
[1:25:33] it and you watered it and you cultivated
[1:25:35] and you said Lord I trust you with it
[1:25:36] and now here comes the Harvest that you
[1:25:39] planted because those seeds of the word
[1:25:41] of God can't fail and if you hadn't
[1:25:43] planted I say start planting tonight
[1:25:46] here's my son here's my daughter here's
[1:25:48] my marriage I'm going to plant it I'm
[1:25:50] going to cultivate it and I'm going to
[1:25:52] leave in faith and say Lord do the work
[1:25:55] I'm Gonna Leave it right here but I'm G
[1:25:57] to have a harvest CU Harvest time is
[1:26:00] upon us the cogs have ground slow but
[1:26:04] sure

[1:26:08] coming up just ahead
[1:26:10] Church
[1:26:11] Hallelujah you're nearing the
[1:26:14] intersection where time is catching up
[1:26:17] to the
[1:26:18] promise oh
[1:26:20] hallelujah hallelujah I planted a seed
[1:26:23] of healing brother Aon I planted a seed

[1:26:29] my prodal yes sir and there's going to
[1:26:32] be a great harvest there's going to be a
[1:26:35] great harvest at the appointed time
[1:26:37] light strikes the seed and it must bring
[1:26:40] fourth of its kind I say once again it's
[1:26:43] going to be a good
[1:26:45] year Hallelujah I'm expecting a mighty
[1:26:49] Harvest I'm expecting great things
[1:26:51] because I know the seeds that have been
[1:26:53] planted
[1:26:55] and I know that the seed cannot fail to
[1:26:58] produce
[1:26:59] amen locked
[1:27:02] in
[1:27:04] listening locked in and
[1:27:08] expecting
[1:27:09] watching
[1:27:12] determined because we're in the season
[1:27:14] of
[1:27:18] change the cogs of the gears are
[1:27:20] grinding steady forward and time is
[1:27:23] catching up to the
[1:27:25] prophecies don't be distracted by time
[1:27:27] slipping
[1:27:28] away don't get caught up in the cares of
[1:27:31] life just look
[1:27:34] around the world
[1:27:37] itself is fully catching up to the
[1:27:40] Prophecies of the
[1:27:43] day
[1:27:45] Sodom wickedness lovers of pleasure you
[1:27:49] say well brother Aaron there's always
[1:27:52] been homosexuals in the world why is
[1:27:53] this botom there's always been
[1:27:56] wickedness there's always been people
[1:27:58] heady and high- minded and Truce
[1:28:00] Breakers and there's always been
[1:28:02] disobedient children
[1:28:04] sure down through the years much has
[1:28:07] been fulfilled in
[1:28:09] portions just like on the positive side
[1:28:11] portions of scripture that were
[1:28:13] fulfilled in portions but there Comes A
[1:28:15] Time of the
[1:28:17] fullness there Comes A Time of complete
[1:28:22] fulfillment cuz we're in in the age
[1:28:25] where these prophecies reach their
[1:28:27] fullness yes there's been wickedness yes
[1:28:29] there's been Rebellion but never has it
[1:28:31] reached to the level it has now where
[1:28:33] the Prophet would prophesy and say it
[1:28:35] will get worse and worse and worse until
[1:28:38] there'll be a bunch of
[1:28:40] Maniacs think about that's how he
[1:28:42] described the world not there's going to
[1:28:44] be a lot of good people you know but
[1:28:46] evil is going to increase and and
[1:28:48] there'll be a lot of no what's the world
[1:28:50] going to be a bunch of maniacs
[1:28:56] the cup of the amorites is
[1:28:58] full her sins have reached into heaven
[1:29:02] The Cry of Sodom is so great it has once
[1:29:04] again reached into
[1:29:05] heaven it's the season of
[1:29:08] change and you can see it even in the
[1:29:11] devil's
[1:29:12] children see because he's not original
[1:29:14] in anything he's a perverter of what
[1:29:16] God's doing he's always taking what
[1:29:18] God's doing and perverting it so we
[1:29:21] believe it's the season of change he
[1:29:23] believes it's the season season of
[1:29:24] change and you see as his children
[1:29:28] change the norms and change the
[1:29:30] landmarks of
[1:29:32] society change genders change their
[1:29:35] figures with ink and piercings and
[1:29:37] disfigure themselves why is the only
[1:29:39] change of the body they're ever going to
[1:29:44] get and they try to have a change here
[1:29:47] because even they recognize it's the
[1:29:50] season of
[1:29:51] change the fullness of the end endend
[1:29:55] time condition has caught up with the
[1:29:59] prophecy and I say 2025 is going to be a
[1:30:02] great
[1:30:03] year not because of the evil but because
[1:30:07] I have some Divine appointments this
[1:30:09] year I've got some
[1:30:12] intersections where I'm going to
[1:30:14] meet predestinated
[1:30:17] moments I've got some appointments to
[1:30:19] see
[1:30:20] Jesus I've got predestinated moments
[1:30:23] that I'm going to step into
[1:30:24] intersections with eternity that I'm not
[1:30:26] going to miss and I'm not going to let
[1:30:29] one thing one Church trouble one person
[1:30:32] falling away one passage of time I'm not
[1:30:35] going to let anything make me miss my
[1:30:38] appointments I'm going to be locked in
[1:30:40] and focused because I know Satan's going
[1:30:42] to come and bring doubt and fear and
[1:30:45] disappointment and what are we going to
[1:30:46] do we're going to take it and we're
[1:30:48] going to cast it down because we can't
[1:30:50] get distracted now we're too close to
[1:30:52] the intersection signs say there's an
[1:30:55] intersection just ahead
[1:30:59] Church time had to catch up to Isaiah's
[1:31:02] prophecy but it did time had to catch up
[1:31:06] to Malachi 4 and it did time had to
[1:31:10] catch up to Revelation
[1:31:12] 10:7 but it did and I'm telling you
[1:31:15] right now that time is catching up to 1
[1:31:18] Thessalonians 4:16 if you'll pull that
[1:31:21] up for me it may have been laid out
[1:31:23] there for thousands of years but now
[1:31:25] time has crawled right up to the
[1:31:28] beginning of this scripture and it says
[1:31:30] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:31:32] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[1:31:34] the Archangel and with the Trump of God
[1:31:36] and the dead in Christ shall rise first
[1:31:39] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:31:41] be caught up together with them in the
[1:31:43] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[1:31:46] so shall we ever be with the Lord time
[1:31:50] is catching up to the promise we're
[1:31:52] right here on the verse of it oh the
[1:31:55] devil says you ain't going to make it
[1:31:57] you're not going to be there I got
[1:31:59] another one that time is catching up
[1:32:01] with Isaiah 14 and 15 yet thou shall be
[1:32:05] brought down to Hell to the sides of the
[1:32:08] pit time is catching up to the word tick
[1:32:12] tock tick tock it's a countdown devil
[1:32:14] and it won't be long in time it's going
[1:32:17] to intersect with eternity and we're
[1:32:20] going home Hallelujah
[1:32:24] glory to
[1:32:26] God yes sir time is catching up to the
[1:32:30] word and soon all scoffing will end soon
[1:32:34] all doubters will be silenced and Satan
[1:32:37] will be destroyed forever but
[1:32:41] you you're about to catch back up to
[1:32:44] Eternity Hallelujah there's a marriage
[1:32:47] supper you're going to go to there's
[1:32:49] streets of gold you're going to walk on
[1:32:51] because your time on this time is about
[1:32:54] up and you're got to catch back up to
[1:32:57] Eternity once again glory to
[1:33:00] God I say it's going to be a great year
[1:33:04] because time is intersecting with
[1:33:08] eternity it's up to us to decide in this
[1:33:13] year what we're going to
[1:33:17] see you stand together with
[1:33:21] me will it be the fault
[1:33:26] will it be the
[1:33:27] failures are you going to be determined
[1:33:31] I'm going to see
[1:33:33] Jesus brother Brown says the devil never
[1:33:35] takes his Spirit off the Earth he takes
[1:33:38] his person his man God never takes his
[1:33:41] Spirit he takes his man God took Elijah
[1:33:45] and the spirit of Elijah come upon
[1:33:47] Elisha then following it it come down
[1:33:50] 800 years later on John the Baptist
[1:33:52] predicted again in the last days God
[1:33:54] took his son Jesus but the spirit come
[1:33:56] back we got the critics we got the
[1:34:00] Pharisees we got the Believers it's up
[1:34:03] to you to make the decision we would see
[1:34:07] Jesus Oh

[1:34:12] 2025 it's G to be a good
[1:34:15] year see I'm planting
[1:34:18] seeds and I'm planning on harvesting
[1:34:20] those
[1:34:21] seeds prophet of God says the word is a
[1:34:24] seed but the seed won't grow unless it's
[1:34:27] placed in the right kind of ground no
[1:34:29] matter how much seed you got if you're
[1:34:31] afraid to sew it the seed will do you no
[1:34:34] good but listen to this every word of
[1:34:37] God is a seed Jesus said so and every
[1:34:39] promise of God will come to pass if you
[1:34:42] will receive it and don't doubt it can
[1:34:44] place it in your heart and believe it
[1:34:46] come from God and water it with faith
[1:34:48] it'll spring forth its kind he says now
[1:34:52] listen what he says here
[1:34:54] don't never
[1:34:55] forget this
[1:34:58] statement the prophet says that I'm a
[1:35:00] lock
[1:35:02] in I make this from my
[1:35:05] heart the right mental attitude towards
[1:35:08] any promise of God will bring it to pass
[1:35:13] he says you believe that amen if you'll
[1:35:15] take the right attitude that it's God's
[1:35:17] word and God is behind his word and the
[1:35:19] word is God it'll bring it to pass what
[1:35:22] it says
[1:35:24] well I'm saying it's going to be a great

[1:35:39] because I'm planting that seed and I'm
[1:35:41] believing I'm not hoping so I'm
[1:35:42] expecting it to happen because the
[1:35:45] passage of time doesn't matter God's
[1:35:48] word cannot fail what are we going to
