[55:18] God bless you God bless you well I'm
[55:21] looking forward to a great night
[55:24] I want to remind you before we get
[55:26] started
[55:28] we are warriors
[55:32] we were predestinated to be in this
[55:35] moment
[55:36] God chose you to be the final voice to
[55:39] the final age
[55:41] it doesn't matter how you feel
[55:48] it doesn't matter how you feel
[55:51] the word says
[55:55] and a prophet told you that you were the
[55:58] Invincible Army
[56:00] the final voice to the final age
[56:04] not another age coming
[56:07] and he knew what kind of a fighter she
[56:09] would be
[56:10] the tenacity that would be inside of you
[56:14] that you wouldn't give up and run back
[56:17] when the battle got hot
[56:20] you would Church
[56:24] you would grab your rock like David put
[56:27] it in the slink
[56:28] and God armed you with the greatest
[56:30] weapon that he could arm you with with
[56:32] the word of God
[56:35] Hallelujah
[56:37] tell your neighbor just now we are
[56:39] warriors
[56:46] amen now tell them like you really mean
[56:49] it
[56:59] so if we are warriors
[57:01] let's make a declaration
[57:04] Bring It On
[57:13] [Applause]
[57:21] if you'll turn with me to second Samuel
[57:22] chapter 22. and verse 29.
[57:28] wonderful services
[57:31] I thought this morning was awesome
[57:33] last night was over the top two
[57:36] and don't get better
[57:39] it's almost like a paid concert right
[57:42] here every night
[57:44] you guys are just awesome
[57:46] you're God's best
[57:49] and he saved you for the end
[57:52] that's why you fight like you do
[57:56] every one of you live in your own circle
[57:58] of life
[58:00] and God put you there
[58:02] he didn't have to put a thousand people
[58:04] around you to crutch you up
[58:06] you stand there and overcome on your own
[58:10] by the blood of the Lamb
[58:12] and by the word of your
[58:16] testimony
[58:17] and every one of you have a testimony
[58:21] and we're going to make it
[58:24] second Samuel chapter 22 and verse 29.
[58:29] for thou art my lamp
[58:33] O Lord
[58:35] and the Lord will lighten my darkness
[58:38] for by Thee I have ran through I have
[58:41] run through a troop
[58:43] and by God I have leaped over a wall
[58:47] it's quite a good way to start isn't it
[58:50] as for God his way is perfect
[58:53] the word of the Lord is tried
[58:56] he is a buckler to all of them that
[58:58] trust in him
[59:00] for who is God save the Lord and who is
[59:04] a rock Save Our God
[59:07] is my strength and power
[59:09] and he maketh my way perfect
[59:12] he maketh my feet like Hinds feet
[59:16] setteth me upon my high places
[59:19] he teaches me
[59:21] My Hands to War
[59:23] so that a bowl of Steel is broken in
[59:27] mine arms
[59:28] thou has given me a she The Shield of my
[59:32] salvation and the gentleness hath made
[59:35] me great
[59:37] thou Hast enlarge my steps under me so
[59:41] that my feet did not slip
[59:44] I have pursued mine enemies and
[59:46] destroyed them
[59:48] and turn not again unto until I have
[59:51] consumed them I have consumed I have
[59:54] consumed them and wounded them that they
[59:58] could not arise
[59:59] yea they are Fallen under my feet
[1:00:03] for thou has girded me with strength to
[1:00:06] battle
[1:00:07] them that Rose against me hast thou
[1:00:10] subdued under me
[1:00:12] thou has also given me the next you've
[1:00:16] heard that before the next of mine
[1:00:18] enemies that I might destroy them that
[1:00:21] hate me
[1:00:24] Isaiah 53 and verse 1.
[1:00:30] who hath believed our reporting to whom
[1:00:32] is the arm of the Lord revealed and we
[1:00:35] say Amen
[1:00:37] for he shall grow up before him as a
[1:00:39] tender plan out as a root out of dry
[1:00:41] ground and he hath no formal comeliness
[1:00:43] and when we shall see him there is no
[1:00:46] beauty that we should desire him
[1:00:48] he is despised and rejected of men a Man
[1:00:52] of Sorrows acquainted with grief
[1:00:54] and we hid as if it were our faces from
[1:00:57] him he was despised and we esteemed him
[1:01:00] not
[1:01:01] surely he hath borne our Greeks carried
[1:01:04] our sorrows yet we did esteem him
[1:01:07] stricken and smitten of God and
[1:01:10] Afflicted I want you to read this next
[1:01:12] verse with me but he was wounded for our
[1:01:17] transgressions
[1:01:18] he was bruised for our iniquities the
[1:01:22] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:01:25] and with his stripes we are healed
[1:01:33] Heavenly Father
[1:01:37] we stand here ready for battle
[1:01:42] not only as a speaker but also his
[1:01:44] hearers
[1:01:46] now father we realize that you are the
[1:01:49] one that has gathered us together
[1:01:52] from all places of the Earth
[1:01:55] and we have come
[1:01:57] it is our moment it is our time
[1:02:00] now Lord Jesus we just ask you father
[1:02:03] that you would anoint this atmosphere
[1:02:07] May every electron in this building be
[1:02:10] anointed by the Holy Ghost
[1:02:13] we surrender ourselves as speaker and as
[1:02:16] hearer
[1:02:17] Lord we ask you to forgive us of every
[1:02:19] sin
[1:02:21] every besetting thing that would come
[1:02:23] against us
[1:02:24] and Lord we ask you now that you would
[1:02:26] anoint our hearts and knowing our minds
[1:02:28] are knowing our lips we have prepared
[1:02:31] ourselves
[1:02:32] you have dealt with us in the very early
[1:02:34] mornings and turned us even to this hour
[1:02:37] we ask you now that you would anoint
[1:02:40] your children
[1:02:41] and Lord as they respond to the word
[1:02:43] it's not my word it's your words
[1:02:46] and father Lord Mayes brother
[1:02:50] branhamwood pet Fritz and
[1:02:53] and he would just tell him sicking
[1:02:56] Lord may we realize that we all have a
[1:02:58] common enemy
[1:03:00] and that enemy is to come to kill and
[1:03:02] steal and destroy
[1:03:04] but we have come tonight to make a
[1:03:06] declaration
[1:03:07] he is defeated
[1:03:11] he is defeated at Calvary
[1:03:14] the war has taken place and our champion
[1:03:17] arose
[1:03:19] on Easter morning and we have an empty
[1:03:22] tomb today
[1:03:23] he conquered death Helen the grave and
[1:03:27] took the Keys of the Kingdom away from
[1:03:29] Satan
[1:03:30] now father we ask you to touch your
[1:03:33] children tonight and every need that
[1:03:36] would come we ask you to touch them in
[1:03:38] the name of Jesus Christ and this
[1:03:40] congregation says amen you may be seated
[1:03:51] I'd like to speak to you this afternoon
[1:03:53] on we are warriors
[1:03:57] I'd like to make it personal to you and
[1:03:59] like you to repeat it with me I am a
[1:04:03] warrior
[1:04:05] ah I am a warrior
[1:04:09] I want you to say it until you believe
[1:04:11] it
[1:04:12] ah
[1:04:13] I am a warrior
[1:04:15] now anybody can fight here and stand
[1:04:18] here in this audience with all of these
[1:04:20] around you and say and say the
[1:04:22] Declaration but what about when you're
[1:04:24] home
[1:04:26] what about when you're standing by
[1:04:28] yourself
[1:04:30] what about when the enemy's breathe in
[1:04:32] his hot breath down your neck
[1:04:38] and it's you and Jesus
[1:04:40] now with that in mind I am a warrior
[1:04:47] the scripture says in Isaiah 54 and
[1:04:50] verse 17 no weapon
[1:04:54] that is formed against thee
[1:04:56] shall prosper
[1:04:58] every tongue
[1:05:00] that shall rise against thee in judgment
[1:05:03] Thou shalt condemn
[1:05:06] so your Tormentor
[1:05:09] is going to be judged by your testimony
[1:05:12] this is the heritage of the Servants of
[1:05:15] the Lord
[1:05:16] and their righteousness is of me saith
[1:05:19] the Lord Philippians chapter 1 and verse
[1:05:22] 6 being confidence of this confident in
[1:05:25] this very thing that he which hath begun
[1:05:29] a good work in you will perform it until
[1:05:34] the day of Jesus Christ
[1:05:38] God is not in the business of getting
[1:05:41] halfway with you
[1:05:44] many of your friends May quit on you
[1:05:48] there may be an urge to where you say I
[1:05:51] give up I can't stand the battle but
[1:05:54] just then God comes on the scene for you
[1:05:57] because he'll never leave you he'll
[1:06:00] never forsake you he'll be with you to
[1:06:02] the end that's his word that's his
[1:06:05] promise
[1:06:07] with that in mind we can quote
[1:06:09] Philippians chapter 4 and verse 13. I
[1:06:13] can do all things
[1:06:16] put it with me I can do all things
[1:06:18] through Christ which strengthens me
[1:06:26] Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10 finally
[1:06:28] my brethren be strong in the Lord
[1:06:32] and in the power of His might
[1:06:35] you say brother Ron but I don't feel
[1:06:37] strong brother random send the weakest
[1:06:41] of Christians go on their knees
[1:06:45] when the weakest of Christians
[1:06:48] go on their knees they cause hell to
[1:06:52] tremble
[1:06:55] put on the whole armor of God that you
[1:06:57] may be able to stand against The Wiles
[1:07:00] of the devil for we wrestle not against
[1:07:02] flesh and blood but against
[1:07:05] principalities against Powers against
[1:07:08] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[1:07:10] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:07:13] places
[1:07:16] wherefore taken to you the whole armor
[1:07:19] of God that you may be able to withstand
[1:07:21] in the evil day and haven't done all to
[1:07:24] stand stand therefore
[1:07:28] with your loins gird about with truth
[1:07:32] with the breastplate of the
[1:07:34] righteousness
[1:07:36] and your feet shot with the preparation
[1:07:38] of the gospel of peace above all taken
[1:07:41] the shield of faith
[1:07:44] who's going to do this you are
[1:07:48] who's going to do this you are
[1:07:52] taking the shield of Faith wherewith you
[1:07:54] may be able to quench all the fiery
[1:07:57] dirts of the wicked and take the helmet
[1:08:00] of of Salvation and this
[1:08:04] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[1:08:07] God
[1:08:08] pray and always
[1:08:12] pray in always
[1:08:14] prayer is more powerful than an atomic
[1:08:18] bomb
[1:08:20] and because you are who you are
[1:08:23] a son and daughter of God has more
[1:08:25] Authority than an archangel in heaven
[1:08:28] because who you are and it's your
[1:08:31] communication with God
[1:08:35] you're not going through a father you're
[1:08:37] not going through a priest you're not
[1:08:39] going through your favor preacher it's
[1:08:42] you and God
[1:08:51] Mark chapter 16.
[1:08:53] and verse 15. Jesus is in his final
[1:08:57] words and he saith unto them go you into
[1:09:00] all the world
[1:09:02] and preach the gospel to every creature
[1:09:05] and he that believeth and is baptized
[1:09:08] shall be saved and he that believeth not
[1:09:10] shall be damned now notice these next
[1:09:13] words and these signs shall follow them
[1:09:16] that believe
[1:09:19] in my name
[1:09:21] in my name what a powerful song a few
[1:09:24] moments ago in my name shall they cast
[1:09:26] out devils and they shall speak with new
[1:09:29] tongues and they shall take up serpents
[1:09:31] and if they drink any deadly thing it
[1:09:34] shall not hurt them they shall lay hands
[1:09:37] on the sick and they shall recover
[1:09:43] this is God's word this is God's promise
[1:09:49] I I like this
[1:09:51] I like this this the this this quotation
[1:09:56] we will fight on the beaches
[1:09:59] we shall fight on the land and the
[1:10:01] grounds
[1:10:03] we shall fight in the fields and in the
[1:10:05] streets
[1:10:06] we shall fight in the Hills
[1:10:08] we shall Never Surrender
[1:10:14] we will fight for our families
[1:10:17] we will fight for our children
[1:10:19] we will fight for our healing
[1:10:22] we will fight for deliverance
[1:10:24] we will fight for joy we will fight for
[1:10:28] peace we will fight for the Holy Ghost
[1:10:32] we will fight until our bodies are
[1:10:34] changed
[1:10:36] and we're sitting at the marriage supper
[1:10:38] of the Lamb I want to tell the devil
[1:10:40] we're not surrendering
[1:10:45] I wanted to hear it from our lips we
[1:10:49] refuse to surrender
[1:10:51] we refuse to give up we refuse to run
[1:10:55] back we are not cowards
[1:11:07] now Satan knows that you're here
[1:11:11] he knows that you are something that he
[1:11:13] has to contend with
[1:11:16] he's got the world
[1:11:18] but he has to fight you
[1:11:23] and he don't have long to work
[1:11:26] but you have been armed just because he
[1:11:30] attacks
[1:11:32] don't mean you have to surrender to him
[1:11:40] Satan knows that
[1:11:43] that there is nothing
[1:11:46] that he can do to stop our Lord
[1:11:49] think about that
[1:11:51] he knows that the resurrection's coming
[1:11:53] and he can't stop it
[1:11:57] he knows there's a bride on the scene
[1:11:59] and he can't stop it
[1:12:02] he knows there's a Rapture getting ready
[1:12:04] to happen he can't stop it
[1:12:08] and if we could just put it real
[1:12:10] personal he can't stop you
[1:12:14] he can only try to distract you but he
[1:12:17] can't stop you
[1:12:21] but brother Ron I've been in some real
[1:12:23] battles well let me just mention a few
[1:12:25] to you
[1:12:26] we talk about Sarah
[1:12:29] but Sarah endured 90 years
[1:12:34] a frustrating humiliation of being
[1:12:38] barren
[1:12:41] none of us have ever had a day like job
[1:12:44] had
[1:12:46] but he had a revelation
[1:12:51] he had a revelation no matter what his
[1:12:53] friends turned against him his wife
[1:12:55] turned against him his flesh was ate up
[1:12:57] with balls he was bankrupt on every hand
[1:13:00] but he said though God slayed me yet I'm
[1:13:03] going to trust him
[1:13:12] Isaac staggered in the Darkness
[1:13:15] in the blindness
[1:13:18] and it was because God
[1:13:21] had a plan
[1:13:23] because as a natural man he would have
[1:13:26] picked Esau
[1:13:28] but God picked Jacob
[1:13:32] there was a widow and her son was
[1:13:34] starving to death
[1:13:37] but if she could only get past the trial
[1:13:41] and take the prophet at his word
[1:13:44] she would have a barrel that would be
[1:13:47] Unlimited
[1:13:49] she would have a cruise of all
[1:13:52] that would be Unlimited if you can get
[1:13:55] past your trial
[1:14:01] if you can get past your trial
[1:14:04] are you with me now sometimes your
[1:14:07] greatest trial only tells you that's
[1:14:09] your greatest Victory is laying right in
[1:14:12] front of you
[1:14:21] Shadrach Meshach could have been to go
[1:14:23] their their names roll off of her lips
[1:14:25] so quickly but they refused to bend and
[1:14:28] bow
[1:14:29] they were thrown into a fiery furnace
[1:14:32] but it was there
[1:14:35] it was in the midst of their hardest
[1:14:37] trial
[1:14:39] that is where God met them let me just
[1:14:42] say if you look hard enough in the midst
[1:14:45] of your heart is trying to know what I'm
[1:14:46] talking about now if I miss you Your
[1:14:49] Heart Is trial that's where God will
[1:14:51] meet you
[1:14:53] Bartimaeus was blind
[1:14:56] but he screamed thou son of David have
[1:14:59] mercy upon me it was physically
[1:15:02] impossible for Jesus to hurt him hurt
[1:15:05] him but his faith spread out
[1:15:11] he went home healed
[1:15:14] nobody would have to lead him to the
[1:15:16] wall ever again
[1:15:20] tonight can be the difference in your
[1:15:22] life
[1:15:23] you wash blind you were sick
[1:15:27] you was without the Holy Ghost you was
[1:15:30] lost without God but that night in
[1:15:34] Louisiana changed my life I'll never be
[1:15:38] the same ever again
[1:15:49] Lazarus died
[1:15:52] and it seemed like that God was had
[1:15:55] carried way too long
[1:15:57] but let me just say this to you Jesus is
[1:16:00] always on time
[1:16:03] won't you say it with me Jesus is always
[1:16:08] on time
[1:16:11] he had to get sick
[1:16:14] he had to come to a point to where that
[1:16:16] even his critics said worse Jesus when
[1:16:18] you really need him
[1:16:21] the doubters were in his ears at the
[1:16:24] last moment
[1:16:26] Jesus knows how to shut doubters up
[1:16:33] and he asked the sisters roll away the
[1:16:36] stone
[1:16:39] Jesus could have blowed the stone away
[1:16:43] he could have spoke the stone away but
[1:16:46] sometimes he asked you to have faith in
[1:16:48] what he's getting ready to do
[1:16:55] he's asking you to have faith in what
[1:16:57] he's saying
[1:17:00] when you step forth while everybody's
[1:17:03] laughing
[1:17:04] while every critic is making fun of you
[1:17:06] will you
[1:17:10] where are you
[1:17:12] take a hole to the stone with your hands
[1:17:16] you may not have the strength to push it
[1:17:18] over just put your hands on the rock
[1:17:21] Gotta Give You Supernatural power to
[1:17:25] push the stone out of it
[1:17:28] because there's a dead man that's not
[1:17:30] going to be dead much longer
[1:17:35] and Lazarus was in another realm
[1:17:38] fellowshipping with the Patriots of old
[1:17:40] but he heard a voice that he was very
[1:17:42] familiar with
[1:17:44] and that voice called him by name God
[1:17:47] knows how to call you by name
[1:17:58] he came walking out of that tomb
[1:18:01] and Jesus instructed the sisters
[1:18:04] take off these great clothes
[1:18:09] he's not gonna need them no more
[1:18:18] I don't know what you can't close with
[1:18:20] today maybe it's depression maybe it's a
[1:18:22] lot of different things you're not going
[1:18:24] to need that no more
[1:18:35] on the roughest of days
[1:18:38] the lowest hours of our despair
[1:18:41] just to Erica if you're listening
[1:18:43] this is for you
[1:18:45] even in those times
[1:18:47] we're still chosen
[1:18:52] we're still blessed
[1:18:55] we're still favored
[1:18:57] we're still forgiven
[1:19:00] we're still loved we're still not of God
[1:19:04] we're still Victorious
[1:19:07] we're in hat we're inheritors of All
[1:19:10] That Heaven has
[1:19:12] we're privileged to walk with our own
[1:19:14] Creator we're married to the kings of
[1:19:17] Kings he calls us his beloved we're
[1:19:21] strong in faith armed to fight Devils
[1:19:24] entrusted with God's word the most
[1:19:28] powerful weapon we're protected by the
[1:19:30] arm of the almighty he places his heads
[1:19:33] around us we have an assurance that
[1:19:36] every time that we call he hears he
[1:19:40] answers
[1:19:44] every time that we come
[1:19:48] he hears
[1:19:51] he answers
[1:19:53] because he is our God
[1:19:59] is yours
[1:20:01] this is your word here
[1:20:04] another man says
[1:20:05] why does God let troubles come
[1:20:10] God harnesses troubles
[1:20:15] puts bits in its mouth
[1:20:17] and makes it obey him
[1:20:22] these troubles
[1:20:25] bring us closer
[1:20:27] fellowship with God
[1:20:33] I asked God
[1:20:35] why are you taking me through such
[1:20:37] Troubled Water
[1:20:39] and he replied
[1:20:42] because your enemy
[1:20:44] don't know how to swim
[1:20:52] [Applause]
[1:21:00] I can see him as the heavens and the
[1:21:02] Earth turn black
[1:21:04] rocks belched out of the mountains
[1:21:07] the whole heavens
[1:21:09] and the Earth
[1:21:10] moon the stars refused to sign
[1:21:14] he conquered it
[1:21:16] and when he went down and descended down
[1:21:18] and knocked at the door
[1:21:19] where the lost souls was I mean the
[1:21:22] doors came open those people who laughed
[1:21:25] and made fun of Enoch who made fun of
[1:21:28] Noah I can hear him say
[1:21:30] I am that one
[1:21:33] that Enoch said would come with ten
[1:21:35] thousand of his Saints
[1:21:37] why didn't you believe Enoch
[1:21:39] why didn't you believe Noah
[1:21:41] everything had to know that he'd
[1:21:43] conquered when he shut the door on them
[1:21:46] the days of mercies was passed on down
[1:21:49] into the lowest pits of hell he went and
[1:21:52] he knocked at the city doors of the
[1:21:54] devil's hell and all that Devil comes to
[1:21:57] the door and has he come to look to see
[1:22:00] there he was
[1:22:01] he said well here you are after all I
[1:22:05] sure thought I had you when I killed the
[1:22:07] prophets I thought I had you when I cut
[1:22:09] John's head off in prison but now you're
[1:22:12] here
[1:22:14] and I can hear him say as he
[1:22:16] straightened himself up Satan
[1:22:19] I'm the virgin-born son of the Living
[1:22:22] God my blood's still wet on the cross I
[1:22:26] paid the price I conquered I've come
[1:22:28] down to take over strip you of
[1:22:30] everything that you claimed that you had
[1:22:32] reach over on his side and jerk the keys
[1:22:35] of death hell and the grave off of him
[1:22:37] and kick him back into a place where he
[1:22:39] belonged he conquered hell
[1:22:51] when he arose he had the keys of death
[1:22:53] and Hell hanging on his side so what is
[1:22:56] the church scared about them
[1:23:01] what have we got to be afraid of
[1:23:06] why don't we sit quietly this is our
[1:23:09] word
[1:23:10] this word declares Us Victorious
[1:23:14] this word declares us overcome us
[1:23:18] we can't lose
[1:23:22] [Applause]
[1:23:30] David would say in Psalms 27
[1:23:33] and verse 1 the Lord is my light and my
[1:23:37] salvation Whom Shall I Fear
[1:23:50] Whom Shall I Fear
[1:23:53] I'm not fearing cancer
[1:23:58] and it's supposed to be the biggest
[1:24:00] baddest demon that Satan's got to offer
[1:24:03] why should I feel
[1:24:07] why should I fear
[1:24:13] people get scared when they get a little
[1:24:15] bitty cancer on their foot
[1:24:19] and here a preacher standing in front of
[1:24:21] you this ain't entertainment folks
[1:24:24] I'm not here to entertain you I'm here
[1:24:27] to tell you
[1:24:28] you can be easier for cancer but God's
[1:24:31] still your victory
[1:24:34] you can beat up a sin God's here to take
[1:24:37] care of that
[1:24:39] he's got the prescription he's got the
[1:24:41] Cure
[1:24:56] the Lord is the strength of my life of
[1:24:59] whom shall I be afraid
[1:25:01] when the wicked even mine enemies and my
[1:25:04] foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh
[1:25:06] they stumbled and fell though a host
[1:25:08] shouldn't Camp against me my heart shall
[1:25:10] not fail the war should rise against me
[1:25:12] and this will I be confident one thing
[1:25:15] that I have desired of the Lord that
[1:25:16] will I seek after that I may dwell in
[1:25:18] the house of the Lord all the days of my
[1:25:22] life
[1:25:25] to behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[1:25:28] inquiring this Temple for in the time of
[1:25:31] trouble
[1:25:32] he shall hide me in this Pavilion in the
[1:25:35] secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide
[1:25:37] me he shall set me up on a rock and now
[1:25:40] shall my head be lifted up above my
[1:25:42] enemies round about therefore will I
[1:25:45] offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of
[1:25:48] Joy I will sing
[1:25:54] yeah I will sing praises unto the Lord
[1:26:02] then how come does our enemy want us to
[1:26:04] set like church mice
[1:26:12] we can go to a ball game and scream our
[1:26:14] heads off
[1:26:17] have banners raving every witch away in

[1:28:08] love to come sit in this service
[1:28:11] the football stars have passed would
[1:28:13] love to be in this service just one
[1:28:16] and then in that five minutes they'd
[1:28:18] like to get right with God so they
[1:28:21] wouldn't be condemned to a devil's
[1:28:22] health
[1:28:23] they may have made millions in this life
[1:28:27] but in hell it don't make no difference
[1:28:32] you can be the greatest celebrity in
[1:28:34] Hollywood but when you die

[2:00:20] and he said oh it's you
[2:00:23] and he went right back to sleep

[2:00:41] we should come to church expect him to
[2:00:43] be victorious
[2:00:45] our expectation this could be the
[2:00:47] greatest service we've ever been in our
[2:00:49] lives whether it's a Wednesday night or
[2:00:52] a Tuesday night or a Thursday or a
[2:00:53] Sunday morning

[2:00:58] have come to my post of Duty and I am
[2:01:00] ready to jump battle
[2:01:04] [Applause]
[2:01:13] when sham guard jumped out of his window

[2:01:27] to be buried in
[2:01:30] he was ready for battle
[2:01:35] [Applause]
[2:01:46] when our Prophet stood in the Pulpit

[2:02:28] stood there night after night after
[2:02:29] night after night I keep saying night
[2:02:31] after night after night and was whipped
