[19:08] Father, in the name of Jesus, this
[19:10] evening we come before your presence
[19:12] &gt;&gt; only with one thing in mind, oh Lord
[19:14] Jesus, that is to praise you, Lord. That
[19:18] is to worship you, oh Lord. That is to
[19:21] lift up your holy name. Lord, we thank
[19:24] you, Father God, for your goodness, your
[19:26] grace, your mercy, for your loving
[19:28] kindness, for everything, oh Lord God,
[19:31] that you are doing for us, oh Lord, what
[19:34] you have done, Lord God, what you are
[19:36] doing and what you are going to do,
[19:39] Lord. We know, Lord God, by time, oh
[19:41] Lord, in prophecy that things, oh Lord
[19:44] God, are coming to a head, oh Lord, if I
[19:46] can say it that way. But Lord, we know
[19:49] that you made a promise, oh Lord God,
[19:51] that we would be with you, oh Lord,
[19:53] eternally. So Lord, we are resting on
[19:56] that, Lord Jesus. Our hope, oh Lord God,
[20:00] is in that. Our faith, oh Lord God, is
[20:02] ready to receive, oh Lord God, of your
[20:05] all the promises of which you have made
[20:07] us, oh Lord. But Lord, tonight, oh Lord
[20:10] God, we want to just remember those that
[20:12] have requests, oh Lord Jesus. Lord,
[20:16] those, oh Lord God, that are in need,
[20:18] Lord Jesus. Our brother Tom, oh Lord,
[20:21] and sister, brother Stany, Lord God,
[20:24] that have need. And all of the other
[20:26] requests, oh Lord God, that was
[20:28] mentioned across this pull pit, Lord S.
[20:31] I don't know, Lord God, personally, but
[20:33] Lord, you know them, oh Lord Jesus, you
[20:36] know all about it. Oh Lord God, you knew
[20:38] it, oh Lord God, before the foundation
[20:40] of the world. And nothing, oh Lord God,
[20:42] has surprised you, Lord. So with that
[20:45] thought, oh Lord God, and with by that
[20:47] word, oh Lord God, we are here this
[20:49] evening, oh Lord, to receive, oh Lord
[20:51] God, of what we have a desire of, oh
[20:53] Lord, knowing that you, oh Lord God, is
[20:56] going to take care of it, oh Lord,
[20:57] knowing that you are going to fix it, oh
[20:59] Lord God, knowing that you are God that
[21:01] supplies all of our needs according to
[21:04] your riches and glory. So Lord, this
[21:06] evening, oh Lord God, as we gathered
[21:08] here, Lord, Lord, we are as bride, as
[21:10] the bride of Jesus Christ, we take
[21:12] authority, Lord God, over every devil,
[21:15] every demon, oh Lord God, that would
[21:17] hinder your will from being performed
[21:19] tonight, Lord God, from the word, oh
[21:21] Lord God, that is coming forth, oh Lord.
[21:24] Lord, we bind those devils, oh Lord, and
[21:26] we cast them from before our presence,
[21:28] Lord. Speak a word tonight, Lord Jesus.
[21:30] Lord, speak a word tonight, Lord God,
[21:32] that would stir us up, oh Lord God, in
[21:34] the in the inner man, that would give us
[21:36] greater faith, oh Lord God, that would
[21:38] lift us up a little bit higher, Lord,
[21:40] that we may, oh Lord God, praise you,
[21:42] Lord, that we may glorify you, Lord.
[21:45] Help us to step aside, oh Lord God, this
[21:47] evening, oh Lord God, and receive, oh
[21:49] Lord God, of what you have in store for
[21:51] us, Lord. Anoint us from on high, Lord
[21:54] Jesus. Anoint the word, oh Lord God,
[21:56] that it may come forth with power and

[22:15] increase. We know that we serve a God
[22:18] that that, oh Lord God, doesn't do the
[22:20] same thing, oh Lord God. Oh Lord, in
[22:22] each and every service, oh Lord, but do
[22:25] according to your will, oh Lord,

[34:04] God is working. God is faithful. Only
[34:09] wait.
[34:11] I am with you. I will never leave you.
[34:18] This is for my glory.
[34:22] You are a testimony
[34:26] of my power,
[34:30] of my love.
[34:32] Oh my sweet sweet.
[34:36] Lift your head up high
[34:39] and one day you'll see
[34:43] why it had to be this way.
[34:47] This is only for a moment.
[34:55] If my eyes are on the sparrows and I
[35:00] make the flowers grow,
[35:03] trust me when I tell you it's all in my
[35:08] control.
[35:10] For you are my beloved. I do all things
[35:15] for your good. Oh my child.
[35:19] Oh my child.
[35:23] I am with you. I will never leave you.
[35:29] This is for my glory.
[35:33] You are a testimony
[35:37] of my power
[35:40] of my love. Oh my sweet sweet.
[35:46] Lift your head up high and one day
[35:51] you'll see
[35:54] why it had to be this way.
[35:57] This is only for a moment.
[36:03] [Music]
[36:06] Turn your eyes upon Jesus. Look full in
[36:11] his wonderful ways. Then the things of
[36:14] this world will grow strangely dim in
[36:17] the light of his glory and grace. I am
[36:21] with you. I will never leave you. This
[36:26] is for my glory.
[36:29] You are a test. Don't know me.
[36:34] Of my power, of my love. Oh my sweet
[36:39] sweet. I lift your head up high. And one
[36:42] day you'll see why it had to be this
[36:46] way.
[36:49] And I'll hold you in my arms and wipe
[36:52] your tears
[36:56] away.
[37:01] This is only for a moment.
[37:08] [Applause]
[37:17] Hallelujah.
[37:19] Amen. Let's all stand together.
[37:22] Amen. When every mountain
[37:26] seems to high.
[37:30] When every river
[37:33] looks too wild,
[37:37] when my ship is lost as sea.
[37:43] Oh, that's when Jesus
[37:46] rescues me.
[37:49] [Music]
[37:50] My faith is strong and carries me.
[37:57] Though sometimes weak, I still beef.
[38:02] Oh, my life is built on this desire.
[38:08] Through the flooding.
[38:10] Oh Jesus
[38:13] rescues me.
[38:16] Oh, and every mountain
[38:20] looks too high.
[38:24] And every river
[38:26] looks too wide.
[38:30] When my ship is lost at sea,
[38:37] oh Jesus.
[38:40] Oh, if his eyes on the sparrow, he's
[38:42] watching. My faith is strong.
[38:46] and he carries me.
[38:50] Though sometimes weak, I still be.
[38:56] Oh, life is built on this desire.
[39:00] Through the flooding,
[39:03] oh Jesus.
[39:07] Oh, city. Life is built. Life is built
[39:11] on this desire. Through the flood and
[39:15] through the fire. Oh Jesus,
[39:20] see it again. Life is built. Oh, life is
[39:24] built on this design through the
[39:28] flooding.
[39:30] Oh Jesus
[39:33] rescues me.
[39:38] Hallelujah.
[39:40] Hallelujah. How many's thankful Jesus
[39:42] rescued you?
[39:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm thankful there's no
[39:48] situation that's too hard for him to
[39:50] handle with. Whether it's the flood or
[39:53] the fire or whatever you find yourself
[39:55] found yourself in, he came by your way
[39:57] and rescued you. What a mighty God we
[40:00] serve. Amen. Let's just go to him in
[40:03] prayer. Father, we just come to you
[40:05] today, Lord, asking, Father, once again,
[40:08] that you come and speak to our hearts
[40:11] and lives, Lord, by your word. And Lord,
[40:13] that you just come and minister, Lord,
[40:15] as only you can do. We commit this
[40:18] service to you. Everything be said and
[40:20] done for your glory and for your honor.
[40:22] Lord, we just believe, Lord, that you're
[40:24] here among us, Lord, to minister, to
[40:27] touch, to heal, deliver, Father, to come
[40:30] and break the bread of life to us. we
[40:33] pray. We commit this service to you in
[40:35] Jesus name. Amen.
[40:39] Amen.
[40:41] Let's look to Isaiah chapter 28 and
[40:45] verse 16.
[40:47] Amen.
[40:51] Speaking of Isaiah, we have brother
[40:52] Isaiah here and sister Julie and their
[40:55] family from Belgium. Very thankful to
[40:57] have them with us. And Amen. and they
[41:00] just have a wonderful time here while
[41:03] they're taking a little vacation, I
[41:05] believe, and and uh spending time with
[41:08] believers. That's a wonderful thing to
[41:10] do. Amen. Be in the presence of other
[41:12] believers and to worship God and to give
[41:15] God glory and honor. Just want to speak
[41:18] today on the faith and the foundation
[41:20] stone.
[41:22] It's reading here in Isaiah 28 and verse
[41:24] 16. says, "Therefore, thus saith the
[41:28] Lord God, behold, I lay in Zion for a
[41:31] foundation a stone. It's a tried stone,
[41:35] a precious cornerstone, a sure
[41:38] foundation. And he that believeth shall
[41:42] not make haste." This haste is a
[41:45] interesting word. It means to be
[41:47] disturbed or agitated or become
[41:50] unstable.
[41:51] It's actually they put a picture beside
[41:54] this word in the Greek of a twisted rope
[41:57] that is tangled. So tangled that it's
[42:00] unusable.
[42:02] So he that believeth not
[42:06] will make haste, but he that shall
[42:08] believe shall not make haste. Amen. And
[42:11] you that believe in this stone, this
[42:13] foundation, you won't become disturbed
[42:15] or agitated or unstable or twisted all
[42:18] up, but you'll be sta steady in the
[42:21] things of God. Amen. God bless you and
[42:23] be seated. Um,
[42:27] just want to say we had a wonderful time
[42:30] while we were away at brother Ivan Cars
[42:32] this past
[42:34] weekend before. And and brother Ivan's a
[42:38] wonderful brother. Um he's almost 96
[42:41] years old and and uh surprise
[42:45] just jump up and down do every run up
[42:47] and down steps. It's incredible. Uh he's
[42:50] got a son-in-law that helps him there.
[42:51] Brother Carmen Meals and really
[42:53] appreciated being with them. Had a
[42:55] wonderful time. Uh you know um I think
[42:58] we're having a communion and foot
[43:00] washing this weekend coming up and then
[43:02] a meal. uh brother brother Ivan Carr he
[43:06] uh said at the end of that service he
[43:08] said um he said now he said we're gonna
[43:10] have a potluck and um he said I want
[43:14] everyone to come that can and be of
[43:15] course be invited to stick around. He
[43:17] said now in our country what potluck
[43:19] means if you get the wrong pot you're
[43:21] lucky to live.
[43:25] Amen. We trust it ain't that way this
[43:27] weekend. Amen. But it's good to be able
[43:29] to be with them and to be back together
[43:32] with you and and to be able to worship
[43:34] the Lord and and to praise God and and
[43:37] to be together with God's people. Amen.
[43:39] There's no better people on the face of
[43:41] the earth than God's people.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm having trouble with Siri here.
[43:45] She's wanting to malfunction.
[43:48] Amen. But we're not worried about her
[43:49] this this evening. We're we're here for
[43:52] the word of God. But speaking on the
[43:55] foundation stone,
[43:58] um I also want to read there in Hebrews
[44:01] chapter 12 and verse 24 says, "And to
[44:04] Jesus the mediator of the new covenant,
[44:07] and to the blood of sprinkling that
[44:09] speaketh better things than that of
[44:11] Abel. See that thou refuse not him that
[44:14] speaketh. For if they escape not, who
[44:17] refuse him that spake on the earth, much
[44:19] more shall we not shall not we escape,
[44:21] if we turn away from him that speaketh
[44:24] from heaven, whose voice then shook the
[44:26] earth, but now he hath promised, saying,
[44:28] Yet once more, I shake not the earth
[44:31] only, but also heaven. And this word yet
[44:33] once more signif.
[44:43] Wherefore we receive in a kingdom that
[44:45] cannot be moved. Let us have grace
[44:48] whereby we may serve God acceptably with
[44:51] reverence and godly fear. For our God is
[44:54] a consuming fire. So we we read here of
[44:57] two kingdoms. One that can be shaken and
[45:00] one that cannot be shaken. And this
[45:03] shaking is a is emotion that is you know
[45:06] or agitation or something that has
[45:08] caused you to caused to totter is to to
[45:11] shake thoroughly to shake the contents
[45:14] together to cast it down to agitate the
[45:17] mind to disturb. So all these words is
[45:20] what it's speaking about to move to and
[45:22] fro to shake to put into a state of
[45:25] waving and rocking and vibratory motion.
[45:29] And we know the world that we're living
[45:31] in is falling apart. I was just looking
[45:33] over that sermon brother Brandon would
[45:35] preach there in the 1960s of the world
[45:38] falling apart. And and to read what he
[45:40] said there is very much you see it even
[45:43] happening even more today in the time
[45:45] that we're living in. So we know that
[45:47] everything that can be shaken will be
[45:50] shaken. I I thought it was interesting
[45:52] as I was studying this. the earth was
[45:54] actually hit with one of the most
[45:55] powerful earthquakes has ever been
[45:57] recorded o on the earth and and and and
[46:01] in this whole world and I saw videos of
[46:03] different ones that were in buildings
[46:04] and things begin to move and to shake
[46:07] but that's a that's one thing but this
[46:09] this shaking that we're talking about is
[46:11] even greater than a earthly building
[46:14] shaking or or trees waving back and
[46:16] forth but it's a spiritual shaking it's
[46:19] a shaking that is taking place and we we
[46:22] see that This world is falling apart. We
[46:24] see polit politics are corrupt. There's
[46:27] no stable ground there. Governments are
[46:29] shaking. Uh there's no stable ground
[46:31] there. I mean, one person uh can make a
[46:33] a post on Twitter and it'll shake people
[46:36] and shake governments and shake stock
[46:38] markets and all kinds of things. But
[46:40] there's only one place to stand and that
[46:42] is on the foundation stone. Amen. That
[46:46] is the word of God, Jesus Christ. Now,
[46:48] Brother Brand will say it like this. He
[46:50] said, "The way that I have faith in God
[46:52] is first I have faith in his word." He
[46:55] said, "If any vision or any person or
[46:57] anything speaks anything contrary to the
[47:00] word of God, then I don't hear it." He
[47:03] said, "This is the fundamental
[47:05] foundation of all God has said to his
[47:07] church. And every person's faith must be
[47:10] built sovereignly upon the Bible." And
[47:14] and I'm very thankful that we have a
[47:16] message in this hour did not did that
[47:17] did not come. and a prophet who did not
[47:20] come to rewrite a Bible to, you know, to
[47:23] as Joseph Smith would. He would write
[47:25] for another Bible for the Mormon church.
[47:27] I I spent some time with a young man on
[47:29] an airplane speaking to him about that
[47:31] as he was going off on one of his
[47:32] mission trips, and he wanted to offer me
[47:35] his Bible. And I said, you know, I also
[47:37] believe in a prophet. I I believe God
[47:39] sent a prophet in this day, but the
[47:40] prophet, I believe, didn't have to write
[47:42] a new Bible, but he made this Bible
[47:44] live. And and I believe that this word
[47:46] of God is strong. It's something that we
[47:48] can stand upon, that we can anchor our
[47:51] faith to. Amen. That we can anchor our
[47:53] our life to. He says when I read here in
[47:56] his word, it'll never change. I it'll
[47:58] never pass away. It's eternally right.
[48:00] Mine may fail because I'm just a man. My
[48:03] words may fail. I may speak like another
[48:05] man, make mistakes or anything, but when
[48:08] he speak, mark his words. It is the
[48:11] truth. Amen. It is true. This is his
[48:13] word primarily. This is the foundation.
[48:16] And he said, "Every church, every
[48:18] bornagain person is built upon this
[48:21] foundation, Jesus Christ, the chief's
[48:24] cornerstone." And he is the gate, the
[48:26] door of the entrance to all eternal
[48:28] blessings. He is the gate, the door of
[48:30] the sheepfold. But this Bible is his
[48:33] word. And if a man or a woman or whoever
[48:36] speaks anything to be the truth that's
[48:39] contrary to the contents of this Bible,
[48:42] it is wrong.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; It is wrong. That's right. It's
[48:46] absolutely wrong. He said, "But if a man
[48:48] speaks and it's backed by the Bible,
[48:51] then it's the truth."
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I I'm thankful that we have
[48:55] a a message that we can say that. Amen.
[48:57] It's backed by the Bible.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's backed by the Bible. I I
[49:01] remember a testimony and I I don't
[49:04] remember all the details, but I remember
[49:05] this part of brother Danny speaking
[49:06] about a woman, Danny Steam, speaking
[49:08] about a woman that came to his church
[49:10] and got real agitated in the service and
[49:12] walked off the grounds and he followed
[49:14] her. if you remember that story and and
[49:16] he began to talk to her and she's like
[49:17] and he began to talk to her about the
[49:19] scriptures and he wasn't necessarily
[49:20] saying where it was coming from but just
[49:22] began to quote the scriptures to her and
[49:24] he said she said oh you just get all
[49:26] that from William Brandom he said you
[49:28] know you just paid him the highest
[49:30] compliment you could ever pay him he
[49:32] said because everything that I've said
[49:33] came straight from the word of God amen
[49:36] this word that we believe is not
[49:38] something outside the Bible it's inside
[49:41] the Bible it's this message that we
[49:43] believe is not something outside the
[49:45] word of God. This word is the foundation
[49:48] that we can stand upon.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Now, I believe that every Bible teaching
[49:53] and every church and every revelation,
[49:55] listen, everything must be built on the
[49:57] word. If anybody teaches anything
[50:00] contrary to the word, I'm not going to
[50:02] believe it. This Bible is God's
[50:05] foundation.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; This Bible is God's foundation. No other
[50:10] foundation can be laid, but it's already
[50:12] been laid. Christ Jesus the word.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; But we know Jesus is the only safe and
[50:20] secure foundation that anything can be
[50:22] built on. You you can built you can
[50:24] build your life upon your your your past
[50:27] uh uh uh uh uh accomplishments. You can
[50:30] build your life, Amen, upon uh your
[50:33] family or things, but all of that can
[50:35] crumble around you. But if you'll build
[50:37] a life that's based upon Jesus Christ,
[50:40] it'll stand firm through the through the
[50:42] h the winds of hell and through the
[50:44] doubts and through the unbeliefs and
[50:46] through the worries. Amen. It's a firm
[50:48] foundation. It's the only foundation
[50:51] that you can really build on. All other
[50:53] foundations are sinking sands. All other
[50:57] foundations are sinking sands. On Christ
[51:00] the solid rock I stand. All other
[51:02] foundations, all other grounds sinking
[51:04] sand. Lots of people, he says, build
[51:06] upon riches. You know, they they they
[51:09] try to make that work and see how much
[51:11] money they can make and they say, "Well,
[51:12] if I can't spend it, my children can
[51:14] behind me." But what does it do? He
[51:16] said, "It leads to slavery. They they
[51:18] become a slave to money. Many people
[51:20] don't have to be." He said, "Many people
[51:22] don't have to be millionaires to be
[51:23] that. You can just covet money and
[51:26] you're just as guilty as a millionaire."
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Wow. He said, "There's just as many
[51:31] pennys than there will be millionaires
[51:33] in hell." All right.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Wow. Amen. He said, "What is it?" It's
[51:39] because your attitudes towards it and
[51:42] what you are building upon. Amen. If
[51:46] you're building and that is your God and
[51:47] and that is all you desire and you built
[51:50] upon and you're building upon that, it
[51:52] will fall.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said another thing, you know,
[51:56] in this America that we live in that
[51:58] they've tried to build on the foundation
[52:00] of popularity. you know, young girls or
[52:03] young boys and and television stars and
[52:06] movie stars, you know, try to act like
[52:08] them, dress like them, impersonate them.
[52:10] What does it do? It leads to a ruined
[52:13] life of chaos. It's stubbles of hay
[52:16] that's going to be burnt at the
[52:17] judgment. Amen. Jesus is the only
[52:20] foundation. It is the only sure
[52:23] foundation. That's the reason we could
[52:25] come should come to him. Nobody else has
[52:27] that foundation. Riches doesn't have it.
[52:30] popularity doesn't have it. Nobody has
[52:32] it. Only Jesus Christ.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; You know, many of us, you know, he said
[52:37] many, many build upon education. You
[52:40] know, he said school is all right in its
[52:42] place, but it'll never take the place of
[52:45] Christ.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, listen, brother Brandon
[52:49] brings us some balance because a lot of
[52:50] people think he was against education,
[52:52] but he wasn't really. He just wanted it
[52:54] in his place. He said, "Now we can't,"
[52:57] he said, "we can't even hardly get
[52:58] teachers no more. teenagers so rough
[53:00] till people won't even want to don't
[53:02] even want to teach them. Little Oswall
[53:03] and Les and all them. They run the
[53:05] teacher out of the building. They set up
[53:06] protests. They'll strike. They'll close
[53:08] up school. Man, sound like he's living
[53:10] in our day, doesn't it? I thought that
[53:12] was the good old days. Said, "I wouldn't
[53:14] want to be a school teacher either. I'd
[53:16] just get out of it." He said, "But we're
[53:18] talking about education." He said,
[53:20] "Education, that's all right. We don't
[53:22] want a bunch of illiteracy.
[53:25] We don't want a bunch of illiteracy but
[53:27] we want education in this place. He said
[53:29] but the trouble of it is today we try to
[53:32] educate our pull pits and when we do we
[53:34] took the way out. Christ is the
[53:38] foundation. Education is all right but
[53:41] listen many times listen to this.
[53:43] Education leads to the demon of
[53:45] education. And that demon of education
[53:47] leads you to be a know-it-all.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Uhoh. And when you get there, you become
[53:53] an infidel and you deny Christ.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; So this is where he said we don't we're
[53:59] not pro to promote illiteracy. That's
[54:01] not what we want. But we want it in its
[54:04] place. Our foundation is not upon
[54:06] education. It's upon Christ.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Listen, a good education, a diploma do
[54:14] you well in this life. Amen. Many of
[54:16] many of you got diplomas on your wall
[54:17] and has done you well, but it will not
[54:19] get you to the other side. All right.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; There's only one thing that'll get you
[54:23] to the other side, and that's Jesus
[54:24] Christ.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Neither can we build it, he said,
[54:27] upon political powers. Well, I, you
[54:29] know, well, I'm a Democrat. I'm a
[54:31] Republican. He said, both parties are
[54:33] rotten.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. There's only one
[54:38] foundation built upon Christ. This
[54:41] nation don't need to rely upon any other
[54:43] foundation, but Jesus Christ. No other
[54:46] foundation is laid. No other foundation
[54:47] you can get to heaven on. No other
[54:49] foundation is secure but a foundation of
[54:52] Jesus Christ.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; He speaks about a building that he saw
[54:57] one time in New York. So I was riding
[55:00] along with a minister friend of mine and
[55:01] he said, "Oh, it's a great beautiful
[55:03] building." He said, "I I looked there
[55:05] and it's probably 50 stories, maybe 60
[55:07] mammoth, big place, beautiful, all
[55:10] intricate details and stuff, but I
[55:13] there's no one in there." I said, "Well,
[55:15] what's wrong? There's nobody in the
[55:16] building. what's the matter? He said,
[55:19] 'He give me the estimation of what that
[55:21] building cost and the millions to build
[55:23] that building. I said, 'Well, why don't
[55:25] they let somebody move into it? He said,
[55:27] as soon as the building was almost
[55:29] completed, all the outside polished and
[55:31] everything, they come to find out that
[55:33] the foundation wasn't right. It had been
[55:35] laid upon some kind of soap stone and
[55:38] not real stone.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; He said, "Therefore, the building was
[55:42] condemned." And said, "It only serves as
[55:44] one thing. It served for that contractor
[55:47] to climb up to the top and to jump off
[55:49] and commit suicide.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "No matter how good the outside
[55:55] looks,
[55:56] &gt;&gt; there's all not another foundation
[55:58] that's sure, but the foundation of Jesus
[56:01] Christ, he is the real foundation to be
[56:04] built on." And you, you know, I thought
[56:05] about that in this context of this quote
[56:08] as we built this church. We took core
[56:10] samples of this soil and we found out
[56:12] this soil had a lot of movement in it.
[56:13] And so the the engineers would design a
[56:17] lot of concrete and a lot of a lot of
[56:18] tension lines and a lot of a lot of
[56:20] things, a waffle slab, all kinds of
[56:23] stuff. Why? Because you got to get the
[56:25] foundation right. Because you can just
[56:27] go out, well, I'm going to put it out
[56:28] here and pour a bunch of concrete, build
[56:30] up a nice, beautiful building, and next
[56:32] few years that thing will be all
[56:34] crumbled apart or lean way over and
[56:36] condemned. Why? Because the foundation
[56:38] wasn't right. And this is where brother
[56:40] Brandon was ministering on and trying to
[56:42] put his emphasis on. Was Jesus Christ
[56:44] the same yesterday, today, and forever?
[56:47] He didn't come to build a new
[56:48] foundation. He said the foundation is
[56:51] already here. It's Jesus Christ. We just
[56:53] got to bring and build our building upon
[56:56] this foundation.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; This is the word Job. And they're
[57:02] speaking of the word haste at the
[57:04] beginning. Job said, "Therefore, my
[57:06] thoughts cause me to answer and for this
[57:08] I make haste again, you know, because
[57:10] his found he said he got he was looking
[57:12] and searching for his foundation." He
[57:15] was looking to see where he because he
[57:17] was in a storm. We know Job's story. He
[57:19] was in a big storm and and against a a
[57:21] lot of winds were blowing and a lot of
[57:23] people were saying things and he said,
[57:24] "But if I listen to my own self and I
[57:27] try to build it on my own self, on my
[57:29] own thoughts, then I make haste. Then I
[57:32] become a twisted rope. Then I become
[57:34] tangled and unusable.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; This is what he this is what Jesus was
[57:40] saying in Matthew chapter 7 and verse 24
[57:43] when he said therefore whosoever heareth
[57:45] the sayings of mine and doeth them. I
[57:47] will liken them unto a wise man which
[57:50] build his house upon a rock. And the
[57:52] rain descended and the floods came and
[57:54] the winds blew and it beat against that
[57:56] house and fell not for it was founded
[57:58] upon a rock. He was founded upon a rock.
[58:01] And everyone that heareth these sayings
[58:03] of mine, and doeth them not, shall be
[58:05] likened unto a foolish man, which build
[58:08] his house upon a sand. And the rains
[58:10] descended, and the floods came, and the
[58:12] winds blew, and beat upon that house,
[58:15] and it fell, and great was the fall of
[58:17] it. Now notice the difference. One, the
[58:19] difference was two different
[58:20] foundations.
[58:22] But also, there was another difference.
[58:23] The war because but there was a lot of
[58:25] similarities. The wise and the foolish
[58:27] both get rain. They both got floods.
[58:29] They both got winds. They both heard the
[58:32] sayings. But only one did them.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Because he said, "Not only heareth my
[58:39] words, but doeth them."
[58:43] &gt;&gt; All right. This is what puts you on the
[58:46] right foundation.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Is you're not just hearing the word, but
[58:50] you're doing it. Amen.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; You know, people can come and hear the
[58:54] word and jump up and down, shout
[58:56] hallelujah and amen louder than anybody
[58:58] else and go out there and live like the
[58:59] devil.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? And it shows their house is
[59:05] not built upon a rock.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; But if your house is on the right
[59:08] foundation, you don't just hear the
[59:10] word, but you do it.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. The li the word is not just heard,
[59:16] but the word is lived. Amen.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; This is what James chapter 1 and verse
[59:22] 22 says. Prove yourselves doers of the
[59:25] word, actively and continually obeying
[59:28] God's precepts and not merely listeners.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Not merely listeners who hear the word
[59:35] but fail to internalize its meaning,
[59:38] deluding yourselves by unsound reasoning
[59:41] contrary to the truth. For if anyone
[59:43] only listens to the word without obeying
[59:46] it, he's like a man who looks very
[59:48] carefully at his natural face in a
[59:50] mirror. For once he's looked at himself
[59:52] and gone away, he immediately forgets
[59:54] what he looked like.
[59:56] I love how the Living P the Passion
[59:59] translation put it. He said, "I if if
[1:00:01] one just listens, they come to the house
[1:00:03] of God and they see what God says about
[1:00:06] them, but they go right out there and
[1:00:08] they forget all about it.
[1:00:13] and they're blown away and they're
[1:00:15] shaken and they're moved and and this
[1:00:17] comes and that comes and and and instead
[1:00:20] of relying on their foundation, they
[1:00:21] start relying on their thoughts.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; And this is where Job was trying to warn
[1:00:26] you. If you do this, you're going to
[1:00:27] make haste. You're going to become
[1:00:28] tangled up. You're going to become
[1:00:30] mangled. You're going to become
[1:00:31] unstable. Amen. That's where the
[1:00:34] scripture also says the double-minded
[1:00:36] man is unstable in all of his ways.
[1:00:38] Because there's two minds at work.
[1:00:40] There's your mind and there's Christ's
[1:00:41] mind.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. We want the mind of
[1:00:45] Christ.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Cuz the mind of Christ does not change.
[1:00:48] No matter the storm, no matter the
[1:00:50] sickness, no matter the sorrow, no
[1:00:52] matter the problems, no matter the
[1:00:53] situation, your mind might change. Your
[1:00:56] mind to go up, your mind will go down.
[1:00:58] But the mind of Jesus Christ will stay
[1:01:00] there stabilizing you during those
[1:01:02] times.
[1:01:08] But if he looks, but he who looks
[1:01:10] carefully under the perfect law, the law
[1:01:12] of liberty, and faithfully abides by it,
[1:01:15] not becoming a careless listener who
[1:01:18] forgets, but an active doer who obeys,
[1:01:22] he will be blessed and favored in God in
[1:01:24] what he does, his life, and his life of
[1:01:27] obedience. But the world we see is
[1:01:30] shaking. Kingdoms of this world are
[1:01:32] crumbling. the whole earth. All nature
[1:01:35] is grown in him.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; All nature is grown in you. We must be
[1:01:40] on a firm foundation if we're going to
[1:01:43] remain.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; That foundation can only be Christ.
[1:01:48] There's only one place you can walk on
[1:01:50] and get to from here to glory. That's on
[1:01:53] Jesus Christ. That's only one place you
[1:01:55] can stand on. That is on Jesus Christ.
[1:01:58] He showed it very clearly in Jacob's uh
[1:02:01] uh Jacob's life as he would find a
[1:02:03] place. He was you know Jacob a wonder
[1:02:06] and you know yet he had a promise in his
[1:02:08] life. He'd been wandering out and got
[1:02:10] out and some things but he had a promise
[1:02:12] but he was really tired and he's running
[1:02:13] in the wilderness running from his
[1:02:15] brother and you know got a lot of
[1:02:16] thoughts no doubt was going through his
[1:02:18] mind and he he was all shook up
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; and he finds a place to finally rest and
[1:02:23] he lays his head upon a rock. Ain't that
[1:02:26] interesting? a rock for a pillow. How
[1:02:28] many want to go out there and choose a
[1:02:29] rock? But this rock wasn't just some
[1:02:32] ordinary rock. If you study this rock,
[1:02:35] it was actually the same rock that
[1:02:36] followed the children of Israel through
[1:02:37] the wilderness.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. This rock he laid his head upon.
[1:02:41] He said maybe he would got scared. He
[1:02:44] was nervous. And no wonder maybe he
[1:02:45] could hear gallop of horses hooves or
[1:02:47] something. Esau was coming. Jacob
[1:02:49] probably with his little spear to try to
[1:02:50] keep animals off running as hard as he
[1:02:53] could. Had a little ragged coat tearing
[1:02:55] through the wilderness. climbed up that
[1:02:56] great big hill and he looked off to see
[1:02:59] see if anybody was around. But in the
[1:03:01] evening the sun was going down and this
[1:03:03] poor little fellow was so tired he
[1:03:04] rolled over on this rock and laid down
[1:03:07] for some rest. And we know he had a
[1:03:09] dream and he dreamed of a ladder that
[1:03:11] went from him this rock up into heaven.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; And the and and and the way Jacob got
[1:03:18] but look at the way Jacob got it. He
[1:03:21] said God had made a promise and had to
[1:03:23] keep it. And the loins of Jacob laid the
[1:03:26] blessed righteous seed that had to come
[1:03:28] forth. So God had to make a way for it
[1:03:31] to come forth. Amen. So he was showing
[1:03:34] Jacob there is a way. There is a pathway
[1:03:37] that I have made. And so he took Jacob
[1:03:39] and he showed him some of the future
[1:03:41] knowing he was an heir to the promise.
[1:03:43] Not because he deserved it, but it was
[1:03:44] because God had promised it to him.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Not because maybe you got it all right.
[1:03:50] Maybe not because you've done something
[1:03:52] right. Maybe you've done everything
[1:03:54] wrong. That wasn't I'm thankful he
[1:03:55] didn't choose it on my on whether I
[1:03:57] deserved it or not. He chose chose it
[1:04:00] because he chose it. Amen. He said the
[1:04:02] only way. He said what happened? He said
[1:04:04] he said he was an heir to a promise and
[1:04:07] he was an heir to all things. So God was
[1:04:09] showing him amen way a highway. He said
[1:04:12] it was he he said he said he said he was
[1:04:15] laying down and God shuts him off and
[1:04:17] and he gives him a vision. and he looks
[1:04:19] up and he sees a ladder fastened up into
[1:04:21] the heaven to God's throne, reaching all
[1:04:23] the way down the earth and angels
[1:04:26] ascending and descending upon this
[1:04:28] ladder up and down. And now all through
[1:04:30] the years we find that this is a
[1:04:32] beautiful promise laying here that God
[1:04:36] has promised a way of escape. He has
[1:04:39] promised a ladder we can climb on, a
[1:04:41] sure foundation. God has promised it and
[1:04:45] he's hooked it in glory to the throne of
[1:04:47] God.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; He said, but he needed a place on earth
[1:04:51] to hook it to.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. He couldn't hook it in Jacob.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Jacob was a deceiver.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; He couldn't. He He He tried to hook it
[1:05:02] in Jacob, but he couldn't. He Jacob just
[1:05:04] go off and do his own thing. He was
[1:05:06] deceiver. He couldn't hook it in in
[1:05:08] Abraham.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; He said, Abraham, he couldn't hook in
[1:05:11] Abraham. He said he was backslid
[1:05:13] sometimes, shy sometime, treating his
[1:05:15] wife this way, couldn't hook it to that
[1:05:18] lying, couldn't hook it to that.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; He tried to hook it to David one time
[1:05:23] and he took Beth Sheeba and and had had
[1:05:26] a riot killed. Everything he tried to
[1:05:28] hook it to, it would not anchor.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; But the prophet said there' be a stone
[1:05:34] laid in Zion,
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; a precious stone, a tried stone. Now, if
[1:05:40] you're going to try to build a bridge
[1:05:41] and you hook it to stone on one side,
[1:05:43] you want the equal amount of strength on
[1:05:46] the other side.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; You don't want to put it in some sand
[1:05:50] over there and hope for the best. No,
[1:05:52] you want it to anchor in the same
[1:05:54] abilities on both sides.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he said there there was a
[1:05:58] stone laid in Zion there. It would be an
[1:06:01] anchor. He said it's a wonderful stone.
[1:06:03] And he said a precious stone. And God
[1:06:05] being God in heaven, the ladder hooked
[1:06:07] to his own throne. He said he hooked it
[1:06:10] to none other but the son of Jesus, son
[1:06:12] of man, Jesus Christ, the chief st
[1:06:14] cornerstone. God didn't want this ladder
[1:06:18] slipping.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; He didn't want his children to get
[1:06:22] halfway across and one side give in and
[1:06:24] fall to the ground.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; No, but he anchored it in God. He put it
[1:06:29] around the heart of God and he sent
[1:06:31] himself down to earth so he could have
[1:06:34] an anchor point down here.
[1:06:38] a way of escape,
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; a place that we can walk as the king's
[1:06:42] highway.
[1:06:44] God didn't want the ladder slip and he
[1:06:47] tried to hook it to Adam and it broke.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; But God made this covenant
[1:06:52] unconditionally and he hooked it to only
[1:06:55] one he could, Christ Jesus. There it
[1:06:57] anchored. There is no slipping there, no
[1:07:01] sliding there, no falling away there.
[1:07:03] What is it? It's hooked by God above and
[1:07:06] the son of God beneath. What is it? It's
[1:07:08] a pathway. It's a traveler's way from
[1:07:11] earth to glory. You can't fail.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; You can't fail. Look, there's a great
[1:07:17] companies of angels down there ascending
[1:07:20] and descending. They're picking up the
[1:07:21] weary. They're picking up the sick. Oh,
[1:07:24] glory to God. If you're downhearted
[1:07:26] today, there's an angel that's standing
[1:07:28] right by your side to pick you up and to
[1:07:30] carry you along this highway. Yes. Yes,
[1:07:33] sir.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; They're picking up the weary. They're
[1:07:36] picking up the sick. They're healing
[1:07:37] their bodies. They're showing visions,
[1:07:39] mighty signs and wonders. You cannot
[1:07:42] fail cuz it cannot slip. It cannot
[1:07:45] slide. We are saved. God said so. And
[1:07:48] that settles it forever.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; It's hooked around the heart of God and
[1:07:55] hooked around the son of God. We're
[1:07:57] brought into it through the son of God.
[1:08:00] We ascend to him. Then what are we
[1:08:02] scared about?
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; If you're scared, it's because you're
[1:08:07] making haste.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; You're making haste. Getting all tangled
[1:08:16] up. Tore up.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; The song ain't tangled up, tore up. It's
[1:08:21] tangled up, wrapped up in Jesus.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:26] We ascend to him. What are you scared
[1:08:28] about? Our promises is hooked between
[1:08:31] God and Christ and we are in between
[1:08:34] them.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; We are in between them.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; And we're and with angels. He said he
[1:08:45] would give his angels charge over thee.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; He's got angels stationed all along this
[1:08:51] highway.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. A God. Angels of God are encamped
[1:08:55] about those that fear him. All up and
[1:08:58] down. When we we're making up our way up
[1:09:00] this foundation, climbing higher and
[1:09:02] higher each day, it brings me up one
[1:09:05] more round higher, moving up up.
[1:09:07] Everything's happening. If I fall along
[1:09:09] the road or if something happens to me,
[1:09:12] there's a great host of angels standing
[1:09:15] right there to pick me up
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; and say, "Come on, we're marching on up
[1:09:20] toward Zion, that beautiful city above.
[1:09:23] We cannot fail.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; There's no failing to it. It don't rest
[1:09:28] upon what I done or what I do. It rest
[1:09:31] upon what he's already done.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; It's already finished. The the believer
[1:09:38] once anchored in Christ Jesus come
[1:09:40] through that door is put on this highway
[1:09:42] and you can't get anywhere but straight
[1:09:44] up to God. When you rock this highway,
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; angels are there to take care of you.
[1:09:50] Angels are there to feed you. Angels are
[1:09:52] there to nourish you. Oh my God. Amen.
[1:09:55] You might come in this service
[1:09:56] discouraged and all down your head
[1:09:58] hanging down. Don't do that. Amen. Won't
[1:10:00] you just look over a little bit? There's
[1:10:02] an angel standing there. He's got a
[1:10:04] piece of bread to give you. He's got the
[1:10:06] softest hands to rub your brow. Amen.
[1:10:08] This is what Elijah found himself on was
[1:10:11] that highway
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; where angels could minister to him.
[1:10:19] when he seen in the beginning in our
[1:10:20] first parents fall, he seen the covenant
[1:10:22] he made with Adam. He tried to hook the
[1:10:25] ladder to him and it fell. Then there's
[1:10:28] nothing else he could hook it to but to
[1:10:29] bring it down to his own son and hook it
[1:10:32] to him.
[1:10:33] Now it can't fail.
[1:10:37] You know what that tells me? The rapture
[1:10:40] can't fail.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; You know what that tells me? These
[1:10:45] promises cannot fail.
[1:10:49] You know what that tells me? I cannot
[1:10:51] fail.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; You know what that tells me? You cannot
[1:10:54] fail.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Amen. Because we're
[1:10:59] not standing upon our own abilities, our
[1:11:02] own ideas, our own thoughts. You can't
[1:11:05] stand there. You'll get washed away.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; People have done it. They've tried on
[1:11:09] their own abilities and thoughts to try
[1:11:11] to explain God, try to explain
[1:11:13] everything. And they and then and all
[1:11:14] those doubts and confusion just washes
[1:11:16] the foundation right away to where they
[1:11:18] don't even believe in God no more.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; They made haste.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; They're nothing but a bunch of tangled
[1:11:24] up, useless rope,
[1:11:26] twisted,
[1:11:29] unusable.
[1:11:31] But our foundation stands sure.
[1:11:34] Foundation is God. God laid this Zion,
[1:11:37] this cornerstone. There we are. Can't
[1:11:39] slip, can't slide, can't move. Then we
[1:11:42] come into the door through Christ put on
[1:11:44] this highway. We may have our ups and
[1:11:47] downs. That's true enough. Sickness and
[1:11:49] troubles. Yes. But remember, there's a
[1:11:51] great company of angels all along the
[1:11:54] road to bear thee up any time. Taking
[1:11:56] you up when you fall. Oh yes, he's
[1:11:58] there. He promised it. He had to make it
[1:12:01] that way.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; The only way he could make it was the
[1:12:06] cornerstone, the precious stone, the
[1:12:08] tried stone.
[1:12:10] He didn't put it in something that was
[1:12:12] untried. But this stone came down and he
[1:12:14] was tried in every way, tempted in every
[1:12:16] way. And it proved on that day the
[1:12:19] inoculation held.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Precious stone, tried stone. That's why
[1:12:27] we can say in the word, the name of the
[1:12:28] Lord's a mighty tower, a strong tower,
[1:12:31] and the righteous run into it are safe.
[1:12:33] That's right. Safe. Nothing can bother
[1:12:35] you anymore. You're on the rock. You're
[1:12:37] in the rock. It's not whether you hold
[1:12:39] on, it's whether the rock holds on or
[1:12:40] not.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; That's why I can't hard to sing them
[1:12:47] songs. I just keep holding on. I ain't
[1:12:50] holding on. I can't hold on.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; If it was on my abilities to hold on,
[1:12:54] I'd have been washed away a long time
[1:12:55] ago. But that's not me that's holding.
[1:12:58] It's him that's holding.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; All along the road, something is done.
[1:13:07] testing you, trying you, your trials.
[1:13:10] But there's angels to bear you up,
[1:13:12] angels to comfort you, angels to give
[1:13:14] you faith, angels to move you along.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. On them days you don't feel
[1:13:20] like taking another step, there's an
[1:13:21] angel just kind of Come on.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Come on. Let's move on. We got to keep
[1:13:25] walking.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Come on. You got another day. There's
[1:13:27] only a few days left, but just keep on
[1:13:29] coming.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; I got to thinking about this stairway
[1:13:35] and this highway. It's got only so many
[1:13:37] steps.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; There's only so many steps. And one day,
[1:13:42] we're going to step up on that last one.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; And we're going to step around and we're
[1:13:48] going to see where that other spot was
[1:13:49] anchored in God around the throne. And
[1:13:51] we're going to say, "Thank God for your
[1:13:53] grace. Thank God for your mercy. Thank
[1:13:55] God for your love. Thank God for
[1:13:57] choosing me when I was unchooable. Thank
[1:13:59] God for loving me when I was unlovable.
[1:14:02] Thank God for looking beyond my faults
[1:14:04] and seeing my needs in Jesus Christ and
[1:14:07] putting my feet up on a solid rock that
[1:14:10] I could stand.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; He had to make a way for this
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; and he made it through Christ. There's
[1:14:21] no other way but through Christ.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Every time that God made a promise, he
[1:14:28] had to make a way for the promise. He
[1:14:30] told Noah he was going to destroy the
[1:14:32] world. So he made Noah a way of escape.
[1:14:35] And Noah, you know, tell him to build it
[1:14:37] out of gopher wood. Gopher wood is real
[1:14:39] thin, light wood. It's lighter than
[1:14:42] balsom. How many ever made a one of them
[1:14:44] little balsom wood airplanes as a kid,
[1:14:47] you know, little ain't nothing to them.
[1:14:48] You just chunk them and they move
[1:14:49] around. Do flip. It's lighter than that.
[1:14:52] How in the world? Why in the world would
[1:14:54] God, you know, why? Wh why why how
[1:14:59] there's better woods?
[1:15:01] Got to be. But God wasn't dependent upon
[1:15:04] the bossom wood. It had to be a wood
[1:15:06] that could take the pitch.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Pine has its own pitch. Oak has its own.
[1:15:11] This was But it had to have something
[1:15:13] that could soak up this pitch that God
[1:15:16] knew would hold through the flood.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Baptist, they might
[1:15:23] have their own pitch and this one got
[1:15:24] their own pitch. God is looking for some
[1:15:26] ghostwood.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Somebody that can soak up the presence
[1:15:30] of God and the spirit of God can enter
[1:15:32] inside of them and not only hear the
[1:15:34] word but become doers of the word. And
[1:15:37] when the storms of life beat against the
[1:15:39] boat, they'll say the anchor holds.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; God takes his foolishness of things and
[1:15:48] makes a paradox.
[1:15:50] It's incredible but true.
[1:15:55] Said he got it ready to float and God
[1:15:57] said that's not all finished yet. You
[1:15:58] got to get some pitch and pour it on it.
[1:16:00] When that hot pitch poured off over that
[1:16:02] real soft balsom, it cased it over and
[1:16:05] became hard as steel. A law could bump
[1:16:08] against it and it just bump it away.
[1:16:11] We're getting somewhere on that. Law
[1:16:14] could bump against it and it could just
[1:16:15] bump away. That's the way it is when
[1:16:17] this little weakly uneducated illiterate
[1:16:20] ill illiterate person comes to Jesus
[1:16:22] Christ. That's about what he is. A light
[1:16:24] piece of balsom wood. But God pours his
[1:16:27] Holy Spirit in there and seals that man
[1:16:29] down. And the devils of hell will bump
[1:16:31] against it, but it'll bump away.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Amen. That devil's
[1:16:37] been bumping against you all week. Don't
[1:16:39] worry. If you got that pitch on the
[1:16:41] inside, it can't do nothing but bump you
[1:16:44] and bump away. bump you and bump away.
[1:16:49] Amen. Depression tries to come in. It'll
[1:16:52] bump you, but it'll bump away. Anxiety
[1:16:54] and fear bump you, but bump away.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; It's what he said in Hebrews chapter 6
[1:17:02] and 13. He said, "For when God made the
[1:17:05] promise to Abraham, because he'd swear
[1:17:07] could swear by no greater, he swore by
[1:17:09] himself." Yes.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; So it was God on both ends
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; saying, "Surely blessing I will bless
[1:17:16] thee. Multiply and I will multiply
[1:17:18] thee."
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; And so after he had patiently endured,
[1:17:21] he obtained the promise. For men
[1:17:23] verilely swear by the greater, and the
[1:17:26] oath for confirmation is to them an end
[1:17:29] of all strife,
[1:17:31] wherein God willing more bundled showing
[1:17:33] to the heirs the promise immutility
[1:17:35] immutability of his counsel, confirmed
[1:17:37] it by an oath, that by two immutable
[1:17:39] things, that which it it was impossible
[1:17:42] for God to lie, we might have a strong
[1:17:45] consolation
[1:17:47] foundation, a strong consolation, who
[1:17:50] have fled for refuge to lay hold upon
[1:17:52] the hope set before us. Which hope we
[1:17:55] have as an anchor of the soul, both sure
[1:17:58] and steadfast, which enterth in within
[1:18:01] into that within the veil. Hebrews and
[1:18:04] on next verse whether the forerunner is
[1:18:07] for us entered even Jesus made a high
[1:18:10] priest forever after the order of
[1:18:11] Melzdc. But he said this anchor of the
[1:18:14] soul is both sure and steadfast. Both
[1:18:17] sure and steadfast. And it's in behind
[1:18:21] the veil.
[1:18:24] It is not something that necessarily can
[1:18:26] be seen like an anchor of a ship. When
[1:18:28] it's down there, you can't see the
[1:18:30] anchor, but that doesn't mean it's not
[1:18:31] holding.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; You know, I I was had an opportunity
[1:18:38] while I was up in Maine to go on a
[1:18:39] sailboat. I had never been on a
[1:18:40] sailboat. Heard about sailboats all my
[1:18:42] life. Loved them. Looked loved the looks
[1:18:44] of them. Got to go on one. Pretty cool
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; going out there floating on the water
[1:18:50] and the wind pushing you and just the
[1:18:52] waves and the winds all you hear and the
[1:18:53] conversation on the boat. That was
[1:18:56] pretty neat. But what was a paradox is
[1:18:58] coming back.
[1:19:00] We went with the wind going but now
[1:19:02] we're coming against the wind.
[1:19:04] Thought how in the world is this doing
[1:19:06] this? You know I'm just a simple guy. I
[1:19:09] reckon I usually you know wind it's
[1:19:12] going that way. Wherever the wind's
[1:19:13] going it's go. But they have have
[1:19:14] figured it out. They couldn't do it
[1:19:16] hundreds of years ago when the Mayflower
[1:19:18] and all them came across. They they
[1:19:19] could only sail with the wind. They
[1:19:21] didn't have it all figured out like they
[1:19:22] do today. But it came in this in this
[1:19:25] last bit of time of last hundreds of
[1:19:28] years, hundred years or whatever, where
[1:19:30] men begin to figure out how to get the
[1:19:32] the sails adjusted just right and how to
[1:19:35] build the boat just right, put a ballast
[1:19:37] down there. And and I began to look at
[1:19:38] it on YouTube because I had to have
[1:19:40] somebody smarter than me to figure all
[1:19:41] this out and teach me a little bit. So,
[1:19:42] I watched a video on YouTube and they
[1:19:44] said they put a balance there on the
[1:19:46] bottom of the boat and the sails up
[1:19:47] here. And it's actually an airplane on
[1:19:50] its side
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; and it's a balance between the wind and
[1:19:54] the water. And they have to tune the
[1:19:57] sails just right. And listen, I was
[1:19:59] sitting on that boat coming against that
[1:20:00] wind. They have to tune it to a point
[1:20:02] that baby is leaning way over.
[1:20:05] You think, man, I was on the bottom side
[1:20:07] of that boat, too, and that didn't feel
[1:20:08] too good. Sister Ruth didn't like it.
[1:20:11] She climbed on the top side of the boat.
[1:20:14] I mean, it was a foot from the water on
[1:20:15] this side. This side is 6 or 8 foot high
[1:20:17] off the water. It was leaned way over.
[1:20:19] But it had to lean like that to pierce
[1:20:22] through the wind. But there was
[1:20:24] something that you could not see. You
[1:20:26] thought, man, this wind's blowing
[1:20:27] against this boat. How is it not just
[1:20:29] flipping over and laying on its side?
[1:20:31] But down underneath something that you
[1:20:33] could not see was a balance that was put
[1:20:35] there. And it was weighed just right to
[1:20:38] keep it in a certain direction so that
[1:20:40] this thing could sail against the wind.
[1:20:42] Not only just against the wind, but also
[1:20:44] the current that was coming in, the tide
[1:20:46] that was coming in. It was sailing and
[1:20:48] going through. Now, it wasn't going as
[1:20:50] fast as what it was. It wasn't going as
[1:20:52] as nice and as pleasant as what it was,
[1:20:55] but it was going.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; It was moving forward. And I thought,
[1:20:59] ain't that the way it is? God has
[1:21:01] designed a people in this day. He gave
[1:21:03] them two wings to fly.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. One is anchored down there. Maybe
[1:21:09] you can't even see it sometime. And it's
[1:21:11] so out of your reach and so out of your
[1:21:13] sight, but it's still there. How do you
[1:21:15] know it there? Cuz the boat ain't went
[1:21:17] over yet.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; The boat is still going forward.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. The winds can blow against it. The
[1:21:25] current can come against it. All hell
[1:21:27] can come against it. But she will go
[1:21:30] through every way, through every wind,
[1:21:32] through everything. Why? Because she has
[1:21:34] been built to take the win.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; There's a people on this earth that is
[1:21:41] actually built for this dimension that
[1:21:44] we're living in. Are built as we heard
[1:21:46] Leodysia overcomers.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; To be an overcomer, you got to be built
[1:21:54] to be an overcomer. That's right.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; There has to be something there that is
[1:22:00] happening inside of you and it's keeping
[1:22:03] you. Oh, sometimes it feels like this
[1:22:05] ship's going to fall over.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Stay with the ship.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; What would have happened if I said, "Oh,
[1:22:12] man. Let me get off this baby. I'd
[1:22:14] probably been under the down bottom of
[1:22:15] the ocean out there somewhere if there
[1:22:17] somebody didn't throw me a life jacket."
[1:22:19] Made you want made you feel like that. I
[1:22:20] understand when them men in Paul's day
[1:22:22] wanted to jump off the ship.
[1:22:25] It didn't feel too good.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; But Paul had received a vision said stay
[1:22:29] with the ship.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; And being man sometimes you think
[1:22:36] sometimes man this thing is going to
[1:22:38] just crumble apart. This thing's there's
[1:22:42] actually two words and I I think I
[1:22:43] remember them right. One's listing and
[1:22:46] one's I think it's called kneeling.
[1:22:49] I thought that was interesting too.
[1:22:51] Listing in a boat is not a good thing.
[1:22:53] and kneeling is okay.
[1:22:56] It's a good thing. But they're both
[1:22:59] basically the same thing.
[1:23:01] That's a paradox, ain't it?
[1:23:04] Both can look like this and you can say,
[1:23:06] "Wow, that thing's listing." And it may
[1:23:08] be true. Listing means this baby's going
[1:23:10] down. But when a sailman, a real captain
[1:23:13] of a ship, knows what he does, knows
[1:23:15] what he's doing, he kneels that thing
[1:23:17] just right.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; My goodness, he kneels it just right.
[1:23:23] And it's the same thing, different word.
[1:23:26] It's in control.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; And I think sometimes when we get our
[1:23:32] ships been, if we just kneel just right,
[1:23:37] [Laughter]
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; it ain't listening.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Devil, let me tell you something. This
[1:23:42] ship is high. She ain't listening.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; She ain't listening. She ain't falling
[1:23:48] over. She ain't falling apart. She ain't
[1:23:50] going down into the depths of the sea.
[1:23:52] No, she's doing nothing but kneeling.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; And when she kneels, all heaven is
[1:23:58] standing at attention.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; All the angels on this highway are
[1:24:02] saying, "Look at that ship. She's
[1:24:04] sailing through the wind. She's pushing
[1:24:07] through the g. Oh, hell is blowing
[1:24:09] against her. Demons on every kind trying
[1:24:12] to push her back. But the captain's got
[1:24:14] her turn just right. She's going to go
[1:24:17] over every wave. She going to go every
[1:24:19] so every sickness. She's going to go
[1:24:21] over every sin. She's going to rise
[1:24:23] above every devil.
[1:24:25] [Music]
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; It's the anchor of the soul.
[1:24:32] When anything is anchored, it cannot
[1:24:35] move.
[1:24:37] I have an anchor that keeps me whole,
[1:24:39] steadfast, and sure. While the sea bills
[1:24:42] roll, anchored to a rock that makes me
[1:24:43] whole, grounded, safe, and sure in the
[1:24:47] Savior's love. An anchor. Listen to
[1:24:50] these words. He said, "When I was out
[1:24:51] yonder beyond the spray one day, beyond
[1:24:53] the spray.
[1:24:55] One day God took this poor lost sinner,
[1:24:58] pulled him through all that spray." Yes,
[1:25:00] sir. Brought him over here, anchored him
[1:25:01] in there, put his arms about me, and
[1:25:03] everything else. No matter what it is,
[1:25:05] my soul lookth up to thee. I now have an
[1:25:08] anchor steadfast and sure. Which hope we
[1:25:10] have is an anchor of the soul, both sure
[1:25:13] and steadfast. Not what not turned
[1:25:16] around about every doctrine and every
[1:25:17] wind tossed one side the other turning
[1:25:19] taking sides over here and taking sides
[1:25:21] don't don't know where you stand the
[1:25:23] Bible says I would that you would the
[1:25:25] Bible said I would that you would be
[1:25:27] established
[1:25:29] anchored
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; foundation
[1:25:32] not saying well I'm this today and
[1:25:34] something else tomorrow anchor your soul
[1:25:36] in Christ Jesus be born again the life
[1:25:40] of God living in you and you know beyond
[1:25:42] a shadow of a doubt that you passed from
[1:25:44] death to life. Your whole hopes is built
[1:25:46] yonder in Calvary. The love of God pours
[1:25:48] through your heart and you believe every
[1:25:50] word that God says the truth. You're
[1:25:52] willing to die for any phase of it. See
[1:25:54] what I mean? Steadfast and sure. He
[1:25:57] said, you know, a ship sometimes the
[1:25:59] servicemen and so forth know you've been
[1:26:01] on the sea really gets the waves get to
[1:26:02] dashing so hard against the boat they'll
[1:26:04] anchor it. It's got a line that that'll
[1:26:06] hold down. Oh, it may flip around this
[1:26:08] way and around that, but there's an
[1:26:10] anchor that holds it. They can't see
[1:26:11] land anyway, but they've dropped an
[1:26:13] anchor beyond the veil within the water.
[1:26:16] That anchor goes down into the bottom of
[1:26:18] the sea, tops some big mountain, drags
[1:26:20] till it catches a mountain, grabs a good
[1:26:22] stone somewhere, and the seieves can't
[1:26:25] move it no more. It's anchored out of
[1:26:27] sight. And every person that's received
[1:26:29] Jesus Christ as a personal savior, been
[1:26:32] born again with the Holy Spirit, you've
[1:26:34] dropped anchor.
[1:26:36] If you're sick and your hope is built on
[1:26:38] Christ, you've dropped your anchor
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; and the doctor may say this and the
[1:26:43] doctor may say something else, but
[1:26:45] you're sure as your faith looks yonder,
[1:26:47] the waves, the six spells, the fever may
[1:26:49] rise, everything like that. But your
[1:26:51] anchor holds beyond the veil.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Somewhere out yonder this sick land say,
[1:26:57] "What have you got on your hopes built
[1:26:59] on?" The doctor says it's gone. The
[1:27:01] medicine says it can't do nothing.
[1:27:02] Surgeries have failed. But my hope is
[1:27:04] not built on that. We have a hope within
[1:27:06] the veil. What veil? Through the
[1:27:08] shedding of his blood that tore his
[1:27:10] spirit from his body. And in between
[1:27:11] that veil there, the anchor has caught a
[1:27:14] hold of something. I've seen a ship one
[1:27:16] time that was so tossed out there. But
[1:27:18] what was holding the ship in that same
[1:27:19] spot, I couldn't understand it. But
[1:27:21] sitting out there in that sea, bobbing
[1:27:23] up and down, waves, knocking it this way
[1:27:25] and this way, but staying right there, I
[1:27:27] couldn't see nothing. But there was this
[1:27:29] little wire rope that ran out of the bow
[1:27:31] of that ship into an anchor caught
[1:27:32] beneath somewhere into a rock beyond
[1:27:35] that water and it was holding. Praise be
[1:27:37] to God. I said, "One day I also found
[1:27:40] that same anchor."
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Sure, I may bob around and I may move
[1:27:44] and things may get a little hilar every
[1:27:46] once in a while, but I shall not be
[1:27:48] moved.
[1:27:58] I cast an anchor beyond something I
[1:28:00] can't see and something is caught hold.
[1:28:03] And when the battle is raging, the
[1:28:05] anchor holds within the veil. And when
[1:28:07] if if the devils rise and troubles arise
[1:28:09] and all those things around me give way,
[1:28:12] my anchor will hold. Where's it at? It's
[1:28:14] in the rock of ages. It's in that firm
[1:28:17] foundation. that foundation stone that's
[1:28:20] steadfast, unmovable, and it will hold
[1:28:24] sure and steadfast.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together. Real faith
[1:28:31] doesn't shift by creeds or man-made
[1:28:33] doctrines and unbelief. It stays right
[1:28:36] with the word.
[1:28:38] Real faith in the word. Where can you
[1:28:41] put your faith in anything else but the
[1:28:44] word?
[1:28:47] real faith. It doesn't shift.
[1:28:53] It draws from God's book, the Bible, his
[1:28:56] attributes, what he promised, his word.
[1:29:00] And the word produces itself. It has to
[1:29:02] be a thought before word. And the word
[1:29:04] may then becomes manifested. That's
[1:29:06] where you draw your strength from.
[1:29:08] That's where you anchor yourself, the
[1:29:11] word.
[1:29:14] Amen.
[1:29:15] Hallelujah. Maybe tonight just want to
[1:29:19] say, "God, I I I just need my anchor
[1:29:21] just to grab a little little tighter.
[1:29:26] Maybe this ballast can just level me out
[1:29:30] just a little bit. Lord, I've been in
[1:29:31] the in this water rocking around, but I
[1:29:34] just need to just tighten up the ropes a
[1:29:36] little bit because I know that anchor
[1:29:38] holds." Bless you tonight, saints.
[1:29:43] Bless you tonight.
[1:29:47] Lord Jesus, thank you for the anchor
[1:29:49] that holds.
[1:29:52] Thank you, Lord.
[1:29:55] Thank you, Father, for a firm
[1:29:57] foundation, something we can stand upon.
[1:30:00] We can have true faith in, Lord, that
[1:30:02] when all hell is against us, waves are
[1:30:05] crashing in and winds blowing,
[1:30:09] we can pierce right through every gale,
[1:30:12] crest every wave,
[1:30:16] because there's something that's holding
[1:30:17] us and there's something that's drawing
[1:30:19] us. It's a paradox, Lord.
[1:30:25] This road we're on is anchored in two
[1:30:27] places.
[1:30:29] One around your throne, one in the rock,
[1:30:32] Christ Jesus.
[1:30:34] Thank you for those angels that gives us
[1:30:36] help along the way.
[1:30:39] Those extra pushes we need sometimes.
[1:30:43] Thank you, Lord, that they surround us,
[1:30:46] with us, guiding us, helping us along
[1:30:48] life's journey,
[1:30:50] our weakest moments.
[1:30:53] We love you, Lord, and we praise you.
[1:30:56] Bless the hands that were lifted all
[1:30:58] over this building, Lord. May we just
[1:31:00] tighten up the ropes, Lord, and make our
[1:31:02] anchors sure
[1:31:04] that it'll be steadfast and steady. That
[1:31:07] no matter what comes our way, Lord, that
[1:31:09] we'll be able to crest through every bit
[1:31:11] of it. We pray in Jesus name.
[1:31:15] Amen.
[1:31:17] Amen. Let's stand together. Let's sing
[1:31:19] that song. I shall not be moved. What
[1:31:20] key is that in just glory? I don't know.
[1:31:23] B flat maybe. I don't know. Is that what
[1:31:26] it is? G. Okay.
[1:31:28] [Music]
[1:31:32] Well, I shall not be. I shall not be
[1:31:36] moved.
[1:31:38] I shall not be. I shall not be moved.

[1:32:11] I shall not be moved.
[1:32:17] For Jesus is my savior. I shall not be
[1:32:21] moved.
[1:32:22] In his love and favor I shall not be
[1:32:26] moved.
[1:32:29] Oh that's planted by the father.

[1:33:01] Oh, in my Christ abiding,
[1:33:04] I shall not be moved.
[1:33:07] In his love, I'm hiding. I shall not
[1:33:11] move.
[1:33:12] Let's
[1:33:14] plant by the waters.
[1:33:18] Oh, I shall not be moved.
[1:33:23] Oh, I shall not be.
[1:33:28] Oh yes, I shall not be. I shall not be.
[1:33:34] [Music]
[1:33:37] Oh, by the waters I shall not be moved.
[1:33:45] And if I trust him ever, I shall not be
[1:33:49] moved.
[1:33:51] He will fail me never. I shall not be
[1:33:55] moved. Just like a tree that's planted
[1:33:58] by the waterers.
[1:34:02] Oh, I shall not. Oh, I shall not be. I
[1:34:08] shall.
[1:34:14] [Music]
[1:34:23] Oh, I shall not be moved.
[1:34:29] Oh, in my trust him ever. I shall not be
[1:34:33] moved.
[1:34:35] He will fail me never. I shall not be
[1:34:39] moved. Like a tree
[1:34:41] planted by the water.
[1:34:45] Oh, I shall not be moved.
[1:34:50] And I shall not be I shall not be moved.
[1:34:56] Oh, I shall not be I shall not be moved
[1:35:01] like a tree that's planted by the water.
[1:35:07] Oh, I shall not flee.
[1:35:11] Though the tempest say, though the
[1:35:13] tempest rages, I shall not be moved. And
[1:35:18] on the rock of aes, I shall not be
[1:35:22] moved. Like a tree that's planted by the
[1:35:27] waters.
[1:35:29] Oh, I shall not be moved
[1:35:34] and I shall not be.
[1:35:40] Oh, I shall not be I shall not be moved.
[1:35:46] Oh, planted by the water.

[1:36:06] moved. Like a tree
[1:36:09] planted by the water.

[1:36:40] I saw the light. I saw the light.
[1:36:46] No more in darkness, no more in night.
[1:36:50] And now I'm so happy. No sorrow inside.
[1:36:56] Oh, praise the Lord. I saw the life. I
[1:37:02] wondered so painless. A life filled with
[1:37:06] sin. I wouldn't let my dear Savior in.
[1:37:12] that Jesus came like a stranger in the
[1:37:16] night. Oh, praise the Lord.

[1:37:44] and just like a blind man I wandered
[1:37:48] along.
[1:37:50] Worries and fears I claimed as my own.
[1:37:55] Oh then like the blind man. God gave
[1:37:59] back his sight.
[1:38:01] Praise the Lord. I saw the light. I saw
[1:38:07] the light. Oh, I saw.

[1:38:16] Yes. Now I'm so happy. No sorrow inside.
[1:38:22] Oh, praise the Lord. Oh, I saw. You see,
[1:38:27] I was a fool to wander and straight.
[1:38:33] Straight is the gate and narrow is the
[1:38:37] way.
[1:38:38] Now I have traded the wrong for the
[1:38:42] right. Oh, praise the Lord. I saw the
[1:38:47] light. I saw the light.
