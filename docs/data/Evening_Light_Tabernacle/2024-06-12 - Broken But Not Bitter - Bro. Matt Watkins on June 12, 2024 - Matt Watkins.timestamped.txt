[40:19] that but he's a lot bigger guy than I am
[40:21] 20 20 about to be 21 years old it's
[40:23] amazing how fast time flies and I was
[40:26] just reminiscing and just thinking of

[40:50] say that I've been blessed to not just
[40:52] know him uh in the pull pit but to get
[40:54] to know him as a person and I've just
[40:57] found such a
[40:58] genuine uh just the nature of Christ and

[41:03] brother Tim how much I love you and
[41:05] appreciate you I believe this church

[41:14] someone who I've I've seen you know I've
[41:16] just I've watched in his not just in you
[41:19] know just in his nature but he he's a
[41:22] strong firm person with deep convictions
[41:25] but yet he's he's got the gentle ESS and
[41:27] the meekness and the humility of Christ
[41:30] and it's it's ministered to me it's
[41:32] spoken to me he been a great blessing

[41:46] last meetings that we had and so amen I
[41:49] just want to say I'm so glad to be part
[41:51] of the body of Christ aren't you happy
[41:53] to be in that family amen aren't you
[41:56] glad to be called amen one of the few
[42:00] amen I can say I'm one of them Lord amen
[42:02] and we might be separated by Miles and
[42:04] distances and you have your challenges
[42:06] here and we have our challenges there
[42:09] but one day we're going to we're going
[42:10] to put our feet up and uh trouble will
[42:13] be over all of our pain will be over all
[42:15] the sorrow will be yesterday and this
[42:17] will just look like a faint memory Amen
[42:19] on that happy Golden Shore there's just
[42:21] Joy amen unspeakable amen but while
[42:25] we're here but until then as the song
[42:27] says My Heart Will Go On singing amen
[42:30] praise the lord well we just want to uh
[42:32] have you turn to the book of Hosea
[42:34] chapter 6 if you have your Bible Hosea
[42:37] chapter 6 I just uh want to say tonight
[42:41] I'm just told brother Tim that I'm just
[42:43] going to pretend that I'm home this is a
[42:46] Wednesday night and I'm going to pretend
[42:48] I'm home is that all right all right if
[42:50] I do that just pretend like I'm
[42:52] preaching to home folk and thank you
[42:55] amen and uh just just um just preach
[42:58] what the Lord just so pressed upon my
[43:00] heart I don't have any kind of um you
[43:03] know fireworks we would say but just
[43:05] something the Lord really just so
[43:07] weighed upon my heart so heavy the whole
[43:10] ride with you know coming up here the
[43:13] whole uh plane right over the Lord was
[43:15] just stirring my heart and then brother
[43:17] Tim just said something in the vehicle
[43:19] that just gave me such a confirmation
[43:22] and so I just trust that the Lord is
[43:23] just here amen and he has something for
[43:26] you I believe that if you can touch
[43:28] Jesus tonight then that's all that
[43:31] really
[43:32] matters and it doesn't matter me what
[43:35] I've got to say what I've prepared and
[43:36] my notes and the things that I'll speak
[43:38] tonight really doesn't matter if we
[43:40] touch him amen and so I've got things
[43:43] laid out here before me but I just uh
[43:45] want to be obedient to the Lord Jesus
[43:48] what I'm going to minister to you
[43:49] tonight is is very close to my heart the
[43:52] Lord just gives you sermons in many
[43:54] different ways and through study and
[43:56] preparation and things that you've
[43:58] looked at but the Lord brought this as
[44:00] something that was it's so real so if
[44:02] I'm if I'm extra passionate tonight know
[44:04] that it's genuine that comes straight
[44:07] from my heart amen and so we just want
[44:10] to minister to you tonight I want to
[44:12] title this broken but not
[44:16] bitter broken but not bitter Hosea
[44:20] chapter 6 verse one and I'm going to do
[44:22] something I'm going to I got this fancy
[44:25] new watch our church at home loves this
[44:27] there's this little timer right here and
[44:29] it's a 1H hour timer you could think
[44:32] about a Christmas gift or something like
[44:34] that um be a good gift but you press
[44:36] play and then it lets me know when I've
[44:38] preached an hour our church loves this
[44:41] at home so um it don't work here what I
[44:45] tell them though is when the timer goes
[44:47] off that don't mean I'm done it just
[44:48] means we've stepped into
[44:51] [Laughter]
[44:54] eternity be careful
[44:57] amen Hosea chapter 6 let's just begin
[45:00] reading I'm just going to read one verse
[45:02] of scripture here and then I'll have you
[45:03] be seated verse one of Hosea 6 says
[45:07] come and let us return unto the Lord for
[45:12] he hath
[45:15] torn and he will heal us aren't you glad
[45:20] that the one who tears can also heal
[45:23] yes he hath smitten and he
[45:27] will bind us up Lord we give you
[45:31] thanks truly Lord Jesus I consider
[45:34] myself Lord the least Lord who could
[45:37] stand up here and minister to your
[45:39] children Lord at this moment God all
[45:42] that matters is that we don't see men we
[45:45] don't see people we don't even see each
[45:47] other Lord but if I could have one
[45:50] request tonight Lord it would be that we
[45:52] have that mount Transfiguration
[45:54] experience Lord where we don't see
[45:57] anybody we don't see each other we just
[46:00] see the Lord Jesus high and lifted up I
[46:03] pray God that you would use these
[46:05] thoughts Lord that you've impressed upon
[46:07] me Lord and I feel it as a weight upon
[46:10] my shoulder Lord for I know God that
[46:12] you've come to minister maybe to one to
[46:14] two Lord specifically to needs oh God I
[46:18] pray that we would look past Lord our
[46:20] each other look past the human veil of
[46:23] Flesh Lord and may we draw out from you
[46:25] exactly what we need tonight Lord I pray
[46:28] that you would be with me in my and Lord
[46:30] in the things that I'll say Lord keep me
[46:33] Father only focused on and to say the
[46:35] things only that your Holy Spirit would
[46:37] want to speak help us Lord to listen we
[46:39] pray Grant it Lord one and all we ask in
[46:42] Jesus Christ's name amen you can be
[46:47] seated Abraham Lincoln actually said
[46:50] something very powerful and you Brothers
[46:52] I don't have any kind of slide clicker
[46:54] so you can just you can advance it just
[46:57] some quotes maybe that's it there I
[46:59] guess he said something that was so
[47:01] powerful uh I thought was so good I I
[47:04] wrote it down here and he says nearly
[47:07] all men can stand
[47:10] adversity but if you want to test a
[47:12] man's
[47:14] character give him
[47:16] power nearly all men can stand
[47:20] adversity but if you want to test a
[47:23] man's
[47:25] character give him power
[47:27] it's actually quite incredible to see
[47:31] the results of what power can reveal
[47:35] power can be a very strong
[47:37] intoxicant in fact you'll find that very
[47:40] keen in the business world and Men
[47:42] who've received power and have been
[47:45] given the bounds to control things and
[47:47] to set parameters and to where their
[47:50] word or their rule carries weight and it
[47:54] can become like an intoxicant I can say
[47:57] it this way it power can reveal
[48:00] character or what a person's really made
[48:02] of in a way that almost nothing else can
[48:07] how they not only exercise that power
[48:09] but how they acquire that power how they
[48:12] rise to that position how they find
[48:15] their s with responsibility to be able
[48:17] to exercise power it illuminates the the
[48:21] the what you can't see you know often
[48:24] times what you see is not actually who
[48:27] they are but actually who they really
[48:30] are is is in that very inner manner that
[48:33] inner nature is as brother bham said the
[48:36] real you laying under all of the layers
[48:38] and all of the things that you see
[48:41] externally it's amazing because it's
[48:43] been power that has led to some of the
[48:47] most tragic downfalls in history it's
[48:52] actually been power that has led to
[48:54] subjugation of whole races of people and
[48:57] and to create people that would become
[48:59] viewed as lesser uh in equality and
[49:02] become slaves it's been power that's
[49:05] been given to governments and some of
[49:07] the greatest downfalls in society and
[49:10] culture has been actually power that has
[49:13] been exercised without
[49:16] character now it's incredible because
[49:19] very much like that on the reverse of
[49:21] that it's been power when ruled with
[49:25] character that is actually been some of
[49:27] the greatest what you would call Golden
[49:29] Ages you could think of the divin
[49:32] kingdom when David as the Bible says was
[49:35] a man after God's Own Heart and it was
[49:37] under the rule of David that Israel
[49:40] prospered almost more than any other era
[49:42] that they have to date because it was a
[49:45] man who didn't just come into power but
[49:48] a man who went through the school of
[49:50] suffering and trial and
[49:54] tribulation you see if you ever want to
[49:56] know how God reveals or gives power all
[50:00] you got to do is look how David received
[50:02] the throne as I've said many times and
[50:05] I've said it before I'll give you two
[50:07] versions of David and you pick and tell
[50:09] me which one you'd rather be I'll give
[50:11] you the version of David that is in a
[50:13] palace he's living in a mansion He has
[50:16] everything in in the world that you
[50:18] could have at your fingertips modern in
[50:21] that day what you could ever imagine he
[50:23] has all of the money all of the wealth
[50:26] he has armies at his command and his
[50:28] control he's got no stress he's got no
[50:32] worry he's got no anxiety he's not
[50:35] pressured you know by Financial things
[50:37] or kind of things that might you would
[50:39] call pressure in your life he hasn't
[50:42] made in the shade as we would say he has
[50:45] people and servants and people that are
[50:47] his at his disposal he has everything
[50:50] money in the bank all kinds no kinds of
[50:52] pressure and you say my goodness boy
[50:54] what a David what a life what a man well
[50:57] let me give you the other David this
[50:59] David doesn't have any money he doesn't
[51:01] have any army in fact everybody he's
[51:04] running from he only has just a few
[51:06] friends he's running for his life he's
[51:09] living in the desert he hasn't had a
[51:12] bath in three weeks he's being ate and
[51:14] bit up by mosquitoes come on all right
[51:18] he's running for his life he's dealing
[51:20] with pressure can't hardly sleep at
[51:22] night because of a man a king a crazy
[51:24] King who's trying to kill him now you
[51:26] tell me which David you'd rather
[51:30] be but let me give you what the Bible
[51:32] records there was never a more carnal
[51:35] corrupt David than the David who lived
[51:37] in the kingdom and the throne with no
[51:40] pressure and no worry and no struggle
[51:42] and no trouble but the Bible says there
[51:45] was not a more spiritual David as the
[51:47] David who was running for his
[51:51] life you see we often question trials
[51:54] and tribulations and brother bam says
[51:56] why why does God let troubles come God
[51:58] harnesses trouble it puts bits in its
[52:01] mouth and makes it obey him and it's
[52:04] through these troubles and struggles
[52:06] that were brought into the nature of
[52:08] Christ
[52:11] right you see it would be through that
[52:14] struggle or that trial or that suffering
[52:16] or that
[52:17] tribulation actually would be the tool
[52:20] or the factory the meal that God would
[52:24] use to refine the
[52:27] character where he could say David is a
[52:30] man after my own
[52:34] heart you take that forward to the very
[52:37] life of Jesus and even when the prophecy
[52:40] over brother barham's life and you know
[52:43] the prophecy that goes forth and and
[52:46] Danny Henry there is as the
[52:47] interpretation comes if you ever look at
[52:50] that interpretation it says you've
[52:53] chosen the harder way yeah
[52:57] and he and he and he emphasizes that and
[52:59] he says and it's it's your choice it's a
[53:02] way of your own choosing in other words
[53:05] I didn't force you William brandom I
[53:07] didn't make you I didn't pressure you
[53:09] but you chose the harder way you chose
[53:12] not a fleet of Cadillacs you didn't
[53:14] choose a you know a you know some great
[53:16] big church or some you know great big
[53:18] Seminary that we be we be would be named
[53:21] after you but but you're the one who
[53:23] chose this harder way of Rejection it
[53:25] was your way but you know what the what
[53:27] the voice says and it's my
[53:32] way because it was the way of
[53:35] Jesus and because you have chosen this a
[53:38] great portion of Heaven awaits
[53:41] you the prophet of God says this and
[53:44] it's so foreign to us in our mind of
[53:46] what we think of when we think of this
[53:48] word suffering brother bram's quotes
[53:50] this in Romans if you have that uh you
[53:53] could just display that brother Brandon
[53:55] be begins to speak of this in Romans and
[53:57] he quotes Romans chapter 8 and he says
[54:00] why does he stand by this is the saman
[54:02] church age the reason is in Romans
[54:05] 8:17 and of children than heirs Heirs of
[54:09] God and join HS with Christ if so be
[54:14] that we suffer with him that we may be
[54:18] also glorified together for I reckon I
[54:22] love this that the sufferings of this
[54:26] present time are not worthy to be
[54:30] compared with the glory which shall be
[54:34] revealed in
[54:36] us you know it's amazing because and I'm
[54:40] just going to take just a moment to say
[54:42] this and I'm not teaching on this I know
[54:44] that you're very well Tall on this and
[54:47] and and but let me just say this that
[54:49] you know I fully believe with all of my
[54:51] heart that as a holy ghost filled sealed
[54:55] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost I
[54:58] fully believe the words of a prophet
[55:01] that at that moment your name is as good
[55:05] on the check as your father's name do we
[55:08] have a church that believes that here
[55:09] tonight that you're not waiting for some
[55:12] kind of authority to come to your life
[55:15] when you're born of the spirit of God
[55:17] there's not some fourth stage or maybe
[55:19] by some works of yourself or some you
[55:21] know perfect track record that's
[55:23] somewhere down the road that God finally
[55:25] gives you the the power of heaven but
[55:28] but the Bible says that whatsoever you
[55:30] say whatsoever you bind on Earth shall
[55:32] be bound in heaven whato whatever you
[55:35] loose on Earth shall be loosed in in in
[55:37] heaven and the prophet of God would say
[55:39] that your name is as good on the check
[55:41] as his name that all authority is
[55:43] brother bandam gives the example of that
[55:45] little police officer and he says you
[55:47] know he may be 65 lounds soaking wet he
[55:50] may be just a little Barney five on the
[55:53] road you know what would happen had he
[55:54] got there out in the street and he did
[55:56] he didn't have those clothes on he
[55:58] didn't have that uniform on he was just
[56:00] wearing his street clothes and he held
[56:02] that you know held the stop there at the
[56:04] traffic light and put his hands up and
[56:05] said stop you know what brother R said
[56:07] said they just blow right past him but
[56:10] what makes the difference his stature no
[56:12] his stature didn't change come on
[56:14] somebody his did he get taller no he
[56:17] didn't get any taller did his voice get
[56:19] louder no it didn't get any louder the
[56:21] only difference between that man is now
[56:23] he's got a badge on and behind that
[56:25] badge is not his authority but there's
[56:28] an entire city that backs up his word
[56:31] and now with that uniform when you put
[56:34] on the robe of this word it's not your
[56:37] power or your Authority or your or your
[56:40] or your behavior or some good track
[56:42] record it's not that you've got a big
[56:44] loud voice or some great gift but you
[56:46] could be the weakest Christian could be
[56:49] the smallest in stature make the most
[56:51] mistakes in your life but when you're
[56:53] filled with the Holy Ghost you have all
[56:56] of of Heaven is backing up your
[57:00] word you have all authority and all
[57:03] power hallelujah it's not your power
[57:06] it's a power that comes from
[57:08] above and I believe that with all of my
[57:11] heart but let me just stop here just for
[57:14] a
[57:15] moment and say that yes you have all
[57:18] authority as a son or daughter of God
[57:21] but let me give you the words of a
[57:23] prophet power
[57:27] without
[57:29] character is
[57:32] satanic hello do we believe a
[57:36] prophet so God is Not Just wi nearly
[57:39] giving out power in fact let me just say
[57:42] it this way and I just want to say it as
[57:43] I feel the unction of the Holy Spirit
[57:45] you've received power from the Holy
[57:47] Ghost but God wants to give you
[57:51] more Hello I said you have power filled
[57:54] in Sons and Daughters of God f with the
[57:56] spirit but don't stop there listen
[57:59] friends this ain't a one-off one time
[58:01] you need a one-off one time experience
[58:03] but you've got to feed that
[58:05] experience you've got to feed that Holy
[58:08] Ghost you've got to give it the word but
[58:10] God doesn't want to just stop there God
[58:12] wants to bring you into so much power
[58:15] actually to where your words will be
[58:18] deity the same as deity
[58:23] speaking I want you to notice how
[58:25] brother bam says this in the saman
[58:27] church age and these were just just so
[58:29] powerful to me and I know you've read
[58:31] them and I know you've heard them but
[58:33] may the Lord make them more real to us
[58:35] tonight can can you say that unless
[58:38] notice what brother brandom says here in
[58:40] the saman church age he says unless we
[58:44] suffer with him we
[58:47] canot reign with
[58:50] him you have to suffer to rain the
[58:56] reason for this is that character simply
[58:59] is never made never made without
[59:05] suffering character is a victory
[59:10] not a
[59:12] gift and a man without character can't
[59:17] Reign because power apart from character
[59:22] is
[59:23] satanic but Power with character is fit
[59:26] to rule and since he wants us to share
[59:31] even his
[59:33] throne hold on a minute you mean God
[59:37] actually wants to share his throne with
[59:41] me
[59:43] uhhuh and since he wants to share his
[59:48] throne on the same basis
[59:52] ahuh on the same basis that he overcame
[59:56] and is sat down in his father's Throne
[59:59] then we have to overcome to sit with
[1:00:05] him are you with me here tonight I'm
[1:00:07] just going slow on purpose I don't want
[1:00:09] to glaze over this I just think it's so
[1:00:11] so good you see God's purpose is not
[1:00:15] just to fill us with the Holy Ghost and
[1:00:18] to give us power H for the miraculous
[1:00:21] I'm believing and I am all for that but
[1:00:24] let me just say that the power of the
[1:00:26] Holy Ghost one of the purposes that God
[1:00:29] gives you power is to bring this
[1:00:31] character and this nature into his
[1:00:36] image and the greatest enemy you have is
[1:00:40] not your brother it's not your sister
[1:00:42] it's not your pastor it's not the
[1:00:45] brother who offended you it's not your
[1:00:47] neighbor brother bandam says when I
[1:00:49] looked in the mirror I realize my number
[1:00:51] one enemy is William
[1:00:54] brandom and your number one enemy is
[1:01:00] yourself and so the purpose of the token
[1:01:04] the purpose of the of that literal life
[1:01:06] of Jesus Christ coming back upon the
[1:01:09] worshipper was so that the nature of the
[1:01:14] Lamb would come back on the worshipper
[1:01:17] amen oh I hope that you catch that here
[1:01:19] tonight because I believe it's more
[1:01:21] important than you've probably than than
[1:01:24] what we've emphasized before the the
[1:01:26] purpose of the token life is not just
[1:01:29] for an experience that's wonderful but
[1:01:31] it's so that the nature of the
[1:01:35] Lamb replaces your Fallen
[1:01:38] nature to where your temper is in line
[1:01:41] with the Holy Ghost to where your
[1:01:43] passion is subject to the Holy Ghost to
[1:01:46] where your mood is not based upon the
[1:01:48] mood you woke up with uh in your carnal
[1:01:51] uh Fallen flesh but your body mind
[1:01:54] spirit is subject to the Token
[1:01:58] life friends can I just say this here
[1:02:01] today because I feel it burning in my
[1:02:03] heart I am more Desiring of that type of
[1:02:06] Miracle than any other miracle in my
[1:02:09] life you say what kind of Miracle
[1:02:11] brother Matt to take my nature that's
[1:02:14] full of problems and complexes and
[1:02:16] issues sometimes temper sometimes up
[1:02:19] come on somebody am I preaching to
[1:02:21] Christians the greatest Miracle is that
[1:02:24] God could take my nature and so crucify
[1:02:27] that nature to where the nature of my
[1:02:29] lamb comes back on display in my
[1:02:35] life that's the literal Life of
[1:02:39] Christ the prophet of God would say it
[1:02:41] this way Abel was slain on the same rock
[1:02:44] that his lamb was slain
[1:02:46] upon in other words he was being
[1:02:49] identified with his
[1:02:52] sacrifice power notice this with
[1:02:55] character is is fit to rule and since he
[1:02:57] wants us to over to to share his throne
[1:03:00] on the same basis that he overcame and
[1:03:03] is sat down with his father on his
[1:03:05] throne I love this and the little
[1:03:07] temporary suffering that we go through
[1:03:08] now is not worthy to be compared to the
[1:03:12] tremendous Glory that would be revealed
[1:03:14] in us when he comes oh what Treasures
[1:03:17] are laid up for those who are willing to
[1:03:20] enter into his kingdom through much much
[1:03:24] tribulation right thinking not strange
[1:03:29] concerning the fiery trials that are to
[1:03:31] try you that is what Peter said is it
[1:03:34] strange that God wants us to develop a
[1:03:37] Christlike character that comes through
[1:03:41] suffering no sir and we all have trials
[1:03:46] yes sir I'll just raise my hand for
[1:03:48] South Carolina we all have trials how
[1:03:51] about y'all here good folks in
[1:03:53] Louisiana we all have
[1:03:56] trials and we are all tried keep those
[1:03:59] hands up we are all tried and chasons as
[1:04:02] Sons not one but goes through that the
[1:04:06] church that is not suffering is the
[1:04:10] church I want to be
[1:04:14] in the church that has not suffered
[1:04:17] where's it at brother Matt I want I'll
[1:04:18] move my whole family the church that is
[1:04:20] you mean I can have a church that is not
[1:04:24] suffering yeah yeah you can but let me
[1:04:27] tell you what a prophet said the church
[1:04:29] that is not suffering hasn't got
[1:04:32] it is not being tried hasn't got it it
[1:04:35] isn't of
[1:04:39] God you mean this is how much the Lord
[1:04:43] Jesus looks at
[1:04:46] suffering to mode
[1:04:49] character listen to what the prophet
[1:04:51] says now this now now this special
[1:04:54] condition in samna must be applied to
[1:04:58] every age there is no age free from it
[1:05:02] there is no True Believer free from it
[1:05:05] this is of god this is the will of
[1:05:12] God now I believe that I could say here
[1:05:15] tonight and I believe it would not be
[1:05:17] any kind of a you know wrong way I
[1:05:19] believe that it's perfectly uh fine for
[1:05:22] all of us and I believe we'd be
[1:05:23] dishonest if we wouldn't admit and say
[1:05:25] Lord I want the power of God in my life
[1:05:27] come on can I get somebody I I would
[1:05:29] like the power how many moms would agree
[1:05:31] with me and dads I need the power of God
[1:05:34] operating in my life I need the power of
[1:05:36] God operating in my prayer life in my
[1:05:39] work in my home in my body in my health
[1:05:42] at my church I need the power of God and
[1:05:45] let me say it more than ever before we
[1:05:48] don't need to be going backwards we
[1:05:50] don't need to be getting stagnant we
[1:05:51] don't need to slow down this isn't a
[1:05:53] Time For Less of the power of God if
[1:05:56] there was ever a time for more power and
[1:05:59] more Authority and more faith in what we
[1:06:02] already have it's right now yes sir
[1:06:05] that's right and if I was to tell you
[1:06:07] that I've got a big button you could
[1:06:09] come up and push and when you push that
[1:06:11] button you have all the power I promise
[1:06:13] there'd be a stampede here trying to
[1:06:15] push that button to get more power but
[1:06:17] what if I told you in order to get more
[1:06:20] power you've got to have character and
[1:06:22] in order to get character you've got to
[1:06:24] have a battle and in order order for
[1:06:25] there to be a battle there's got to be a
[1:06:27] measure of
[1:06:31] suffering he said for the matter you ask
[1:06:33] him for suffering nobody my hands are
[1:06:35] down as tight as they can possibly be
[1:06:37] but here's what I know if I ask the Lord
[1:06:41] Lord I want to be more like you I want
[1:06:43] to be more like the Lord Jesus this is
[1:06:47] how it
[1:06:51] comes you see it would be through some
[1:06:54] of those greatest darkest times in
[1:06:57] Believers lives all the way down through
[1:06:59] history to where they questioned what's
[1:07:02] happening in their life to where they
[1:07:04] question everything around them and and
[1:07:07] and there's times when it didn't make
[1:07:08] any sense
[1:07:10] whatsoever and they didn't realize the
[1:07:12] very thing that they had asked God for
[1:07:14] was the work God was doing through the
[1:07:16] Holy Ghost in their
[1:07:18] life through
[1:07:21] suffering it's incredible because
[1:07:23] brother Ram says this this special
[1:07:24] condition it must not M he says he says
[1:07:27] it's the will of God it's applied to
[1:07:29] every age we need us we need the Lord I
[1:07:32] love this to teach us the truth that we
[1:07:35] are to suffer and be Christlike in doing
[1:07:40] it is that your prayer is that your
[1:07:44] prayer that we not just suffer but we be
[1:07:48] Christlike while
[1:07:51] suffering it's amazing because this is
[1:07:53] so foreign to the world that we live
[1:07:55] today to think of suffering even even
[1:07:58] let me just say it this way even in the
[1:08:01] Bible it was foreign to the Jews it was
[1:08:04] foreign all the way from the times of
[1:08:05] job when job is suffering in his life
[1:08:08] and his so-called friends ask him you
[1:08:10] know job come on what's wrong what would
[1:08:12] you do job come on would you it couldn't
[1:08:14] make sense even in the days of Jesus
[1:08:17] when there's a man that's born blind in
[1:08:18] the Book of John and his disciples asked
[1:08:21] him and sayl why was this man born blind
[1:08:25] and notice their reasoning was it
[1:08:27] because of his daddy and his daddy was
[1:08:29] born in sin and because of that he's
[1:08:31] born blind notice their thinking they
[1:08:34] could not fathom that God would allow
[1:08:37] personal struggle or trial in their life
[1:08:41] and that would somehow be the will of
[1:08:43] God
[1:08:44] right that we could say this was the
[1:08:47] will was he born blind because his dad's
[1:08:49] sin or his mother's sin you know what
[1:08:51] Jesus says
[1:08:53] neither but that the word works of God
[1:08:57] might be made
[1:09:00] manifest that's why he was born blind
[1:09:03] let me just stop here and say there is
[1:09:05] no struggle there is no trial there is
[1:09:08] no hardship there is no problem that
[1:09:11] ever comes to your life I don't care how
[1:09:13] hard that doesn't carry this purpose
[1:09:16] that the works of your heavenly father
[1:09:19] might be made manifest in your life
[1:09:29] do you know let me say this and I'll
[1:09:31] just be careful I'll I say this do you
[1:09:34] know there's a holy ghost
[1:09:36] School of
[1:09:40] suffering and fact Philippians 3 would
[1:09:42] call it the
[1:09:45] fellowship of his suffering you know
[1:09:47] brother Joe I like that because it sort
[1:09:48] of sounds like you know a group or a
[1:09:50] club that you're part
[1:09:52] of what do you I'm got the I'm in the
[1:09:54] fellowship of his
[1:09:59] sufferings that this was actually what
[1:10:01] Paul was saying that I may know him in
[1:10:06] the power of his resurrection and a
[1:10:09] thousand hands went up and said that I
[1:10:11] may know him in the power of his
[1:10:14] resurrection but you can you keep your
[1:10:16] hand
[1:10:18] up and in the fellowship of his
[1:10:22] sufferings to be made conformable
[1:10:26] un his death it was actually that Holy
[1:10:29] Ghost school as we call it and let me
[1:10:32] just say this you say brother Matt who
[1:10:34] was part of that school Saints all down
[1:10:37] Through the Ages from the beginning of
[1:10:38] time who went through that school of
[1:10:41] suffering and trials and hardships and
[1:10:44] afflictions Saints who have been tossed
[1:10:47] to and fro tempted on every side the
[1:10:49] Bible speaks of it that way that that
[1:10:52] that that let me let you know that that
[1:10:54] that that you know that they were torn
[1:10:56] apart they were swn asunder and it says
[1:10:59] that this way of whom the world was not
[1:11:01] even
[1:11:03] worthy you say what was it brother Matt
[1:11:06] it was God's School of suffering the
[1:11:10] Holy Ghost school you know who founded
[1:11:12] that school
[1:11:15] Jesus guess who created the
[1:11:18] curriculum
[1:11:20] Jesus guess who created the
[1:11:23] test Jesus
[1:11:26] but let me tell you he passed the
[1:11:28] test in fact he's not going to put you
[1:11:31] through a school that he didn't graduate
[1:11:33] from himself and he proved that you can
[1:11:36] go through anything in your life even
[1:11:39] death itself and come out on the other
[1:11:43] side and
[1:11:47] Overcomer it was Jesus
[1:11:50] actually who formed this
[1:11:53] school to where he was would endure some
[1:11:56] of the greatest thing let me just preach
[1:11:58] here just for a moment because we hear
[1:12:00] all about mental health and and I and
[1:12:02] mental disease and mental sickness and I
[1:12:05] mean no way minimizing that that's a
[1:12:07] there's a real mental health that that
[1:12:10] that that that people can battle let me
[1:12:11] tell you what it is cancer is just a
[1:12:14] name they give
[1:12:16] it tuberculosis is just a name diabetes
[1:12:19] is just a name tell you what a prophet
[1:12:21] called it called it a Tormentor a demon
[1:12:24] spirit so no matter what mental health
[1:12:27] issue that there is it's no different
[1:12:28] it's just a demon
[1:12:32] Spirit but let me tell you what Jesus
[1:12:34] knew what it was like he knew what it
[1:12:36] was like to suffer mental
[1:12:38] anguish did you know that did you
[1:12:40] realize that that Jesus actually
[1:12:43] suffered mental suffered mental and
[1:12:46] physical pain he was rejected he knew
[1:12:49] what rejection feels like you ever felt
[1:12:52] rejected and it's one of the hardest
[1:12:54] things is the feeling of rejection he
[1:12:56] knew what it was like to be rejected he
[1:12:59] knew what it was like to be caught a
[1:13:00] liar he knew what it was like to be
[1:13:03] abused mocked
[1:13:06] ridiculed he knew what it was like to be
[1:13:12] lonely all
[1:13:14] alone no
[1:13:16] friends even your best friends have
[1:13:19] betrayed
[1:13:20] you he knew what it was like to go
[1:13:23] hungry
[1:13:25] the Lord
[1:13:26] Jesus I've never known what that was
[1:13:28] like thankful to God in my my whole life
[1:13:31] I've had a family that took care of me
[1:13:34] but I know that there are people who've
[1:13:36] had to go hungry
[1:13:38] before to be poor without food do you
[1:13:41] know Jesus knew what it was like to be
[1:13:44] hungry to be
[1:13:46] poor he knew what it was like to be
[1:13:50] unloved you know that's a real thing
[1:13:53] people can suffer and go through in
[1:13:54] their life I'm glad and you might be the
[1:13:57] beneficiary of a home that loved you you
[1:14:00] ought to be thankful you don't know what
[1:14:02] you have till you don't have
[1:14:05] it and he knew what it was like to not
[1:14:07] be loved as brother Brandon begins to
[1:14:09] reminisce about his childhood and just
[1:14:11] there for a moment you can tell it's
[1:14:13] even awkward for him to talk about it
[1:14:15] talks about how when he was a young man
[1:14:16] he was made fun of ridicule didn't fit
[1:14:18] in with nobody tried to fit in with
[1:14:20] friends at school he was always the
[1:14:21] Oddball and he said nobody ever loved me
[1:14:25] until I met the Lord
[1:14:27] Jesus and I found the first person who
[1:14:29] really loved me
[1:14:32] unconditionally Jesus knew what it was
[1:14:34] like to
[1:14:35] be
[1:14:37] unloved he knew what it felt like Jesus
[1:14:41] knew what it felt like to be
[1:14:44] shamed to be made the end you know the
[1:14:47] the ridicule to be slandered and his
[1:14:50] name slandered and lies told about him
[1:14:53] he was called a liar he was new he was
[1:14:56] called a
[1:14:57] fraud he was called a false
[1:15:03] prophet he was ridiculed and and made
[1:15:06] fun of laughed at lied about uh
[1:15:10] slandered and and and and CAU a false
[1:15:12] prophet he knew what humiliation felt
[1:15:16] like you say brother Matt what do you do
[1:15:19] and I'm letting you realize that there
[1:15:20] is no pain you can name
[1:15:23] tonight that you're heav L father did
[1:15:26] not become a kinsman redeemer
[1:15:30] to he felt what it was like even his own
[1:15:34] Brothers misunderstood him his own
[1:15:38] mother and father his own mother his
[1:15:40] brothers didn't believe in him did you
[1:15:41] know that go study of the Book of
[1:15:43] Matthew didn't believe in him didn't
[1:15:45] believe until he was dying on a
[1:15:49] cross he knew what it felt like to be
[1:15:52] misunderstood
[1:15:55] you knew what it felt like to be
[1:15:57] defenseless and accusations and not able
[1:15:59] to defend
[1:16:02] yourself the Bible says he opened not
[1:16:05] his
[1:16:07] mouth you say brother Matt what what are
[1:16:10] you preaching I'm preaching to you
[1:16:11] tonight if I could just give you my
[1:16:13] heart I'm all for the power of God
[1:16:15] friends we talk about the power and I
[1:16:18] want the power of God in my life but do
[1:16:20] we talk about the
[1:16:21] character that comes with that power
[1:16:25] that it's actually the nature of the
[1:16:28] Lamb that it's the nature do you realize
[1:16:31] the prophet of God would go further to
[1:16:33] say that that Not only was the human
[1:16:36] life of
[1:16:39] Jesus the human life of Jesus was to
[1:16:44] come back on the
[1:16:46] worshipper do you don't want to know
[1:16:49] what God is trying to do to your human
[1:16:51] life he's trying to bring your human
[1:16:54] life
[1:16:56] to match this
[1:17:00] life and oh I'm so
[1:17:04] hungry for the Lord to take my human
[1:17:07] life and crucify it so much to where my
[1:17:11] human life matches the life of my
[1:17:15] lamb oh do you feel that way here
[1:17:18] tonight
[1:17:19] friend to wear that nature oh I just
[1:17:22] feel the Holy Spirit right now I'm just
[1:17:24] gonna just going to obey him just for a
[1:17:26] moment you know I I fully believe let me
[1:17:29] just say this here today I fully believe
[1:17:31] that that that that the that that the
[1:17:33] that the nature of Christ came on full
[1:17:36] display in this generation yes sir can I
[1:17:40] just preach to you here for a moment
[1:17:42] that the coming of Christ was in this
[1:17:45] generation the coming of of Christ as
[1:17:48] the mighty Angel to sins and and
[1:17:50] Revelations 10 and what would what was
[1:17:52] it going to be it was going to be us the
[1:17:55] son of man Ministry displayed do you
[1:17:57] realize a prophet preaches a message
[1:17:59] called the trial and that message he
[1:18:01] preaches on the critic and Mr skeptic do
[1:18:04] you realize what he's doing he's
[1:18:06] actually putting his own Ministry on
[1:18:11] trial and he comes to the end of that
[1:18:13] sermon and says I challenge you to see
[1:18:16] the son of man revealed in the bride's
[1:18:21] body notice he says I catch your
[1:18:23] thoughts I know you think that was me
[1:18:25] what was it let me just tell you friends
[1:18:26] it was more than just a prophet like an
[1:18:29] Old Testament it was more than just a
[1:18:31] you know a reformer just coming down
[1:18:33] Through the Ages but this was the very
[1:18:35] son of man Ministry oh do we have a
[1:18:37] church that believes that here today
[1:18:39] that what you witness in this generation
[1:18:41] was the Fulfillment of Luke 17 in the
[1:18:44] days of the coming of the son of man
[1:18:48] what was that son of man it was the
[1:18:50] word made flesh
[1:18:56] and you know what you witnessed you
[1:18:58] witness the sign of the son of man you
[1:19:00] witness the sign of MDC you witness the
[1:19:03] the the Discerning of thoughts and the
[1:19:05] intents of the heart what were you
[1:19:07] witnessing what was it revealing
[1:19:11] Christ and brother ROM says I don't come
[1:19:13] to declare unto you to say unto you he's
[1:19:16] coming but to declare he is
[1:19:20] here and you say brother Matt what did
[1:19:22] you witness you witnessed the
[1:19:23] supernatural on a scale that has never
[1:19:26] been seen from the days in the ministry
[1:19:28] of Jesus even when brother Bam's looking
[1:19:31] at St John you you know greater work
[1:19:33] shall you do uh you know for I go to my
[1:19:35] father brother says I always looked at
[1:19:37] that and thought greater you know must
[1:19:38] mean in terms of quantity and the amount
[1:19:40] of Miracles but the angel of the Lord
[1:19:42] showed him it was going to be a greater
[1:19:43] work that he' do in this generation to
[1:19:45] where the very power of creation would
[1:19:49] be exercised in a human
[1:19:53] vessel let me just tell you something
[1:19:55] friends and I'm just going to say this
[1:19:56] here tonight because I believe I got
[1:19:57] Liberty to say it that was Christ in
[1:20:00] Moses hello do you believe that it was
[1:20:03] Jesus in Moses and a shadow in a
[1:20:05] prefigure and when you accepted Moses
[1:20:07] you were accepting Christ it was Christ
[1:20:10] in Joshua it was Christ and all those
[1:20:12] Messengers it wasn't and when when you
[1:20:15] received the message of Jeremiah you
[1:20:17] were not receiving the message of
[1:20:19] Jeremiah it was actually Jehovah through
[1:20:21] the lips of a Vindicated Prophet that's
[1:20:24] right
[1:20:25] and brother brandom says and many people
[1:20:27] will say oh if I lived in the days of
[1:20:28] Jesus you know I would have defended him
[1:20:31] brother Joe I would have stood right
[1:20:33] there I wouldn't allowed those Roman if
[1:20:34] I had been back there in the days of
[1:20:36] Jesus I wouldn't have been in that crowd
[1:20:38] let me tell you what a prophet said what
[1:20:40] you do with your day and Christ for your
[1:20:43] day let me just say it what you do with
[1:20:45] this message tells me what you would
[1:20:47] have done for Jesus Christ back then
[1:20:49] it's no different
[1:20:52] friends it was Christ on
[1:20:56] display and I'm thankful for that I'm
[1:21:00] thankful for the
[1:21:01] miraculous I'm thankful for the sign of
[1:21:04] the son of man through the Discerning of
[1:21:06] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:21:08] can I just say I'm thankful for all of
[1:21:10] that I believe brother Matt believes in
[1:21:12] all of the miraculous and I've seen
[1:21:14] cancer healed I've seen blind eyes come
[1:21:16] open I've seen deaf people I begin to
[1:21:19] hear again I believe in the Supernatural
[1:21:21] I believe in the miraculous I believe
[1:21:23] God's going to do more more and more and
[1:21:25] more of that but can I just say that I
[1:21:28] am just as much Desiring of the physical
[1:21:31] Miracles I'm just as much Desiring that
[1:21:34] the nature of my lamb the greatest
[1:21:37] miracle that can take place takes place
[1:21:40] in my
[1:21:42] soul yes
[1:21:45] sir and I believe that not only did you
[1:21:48] see the miraculous but I believe you
[1:21:51] seen the very nature of Jesus
[1:21:56] the
[1:21:57] humility the
[1:21:59] love even brother brand I was me and
[1:22:01] brother Tim were talking about it today
[1:22:02] and and just speaking of brother
[1:22:04] brandham there and I just was reading a
[1:22:06] quote on the plane right over here and
[1:22:08] brother brandham goes before his church
[1:22:09] and says you pray for me church he says
[1:22:12] I feel like there's been a critical
[1:22:13] spirit came over me and he says and It's
[1:22:15] haunting me now this was a man who could
[1:22:18] be transparent and he was looking at the
[1:22:21] things that were unb things in other
[1:22:22] men's Ministries that were not according
[1:22:25] to the
[1:22:26] Bible he was talking about a woman who
[1:22:29] was trying to you take people over an
[1:22:31] Indian and try to take their money and
[1:22:33] do some kind of gift and and brother
[1:22:34] Brandon was was being becoming critical
[1:22:37] of things that you would say you should
[1:22:38] be critical over and yet the prophet of
[1:22:42] God said you pray for me because if I
[1:22:45] get critical of that I'll lose my favor
[1:22:48] with
[1:22:51] God say brother Matt why was that
[1:22:54] because I believe it was the nature of
[1:22:56] the
[1:22:58] lamb and came back on the
[1:23:00] worshipper you say brother Matt what do
[1:23:02] you saying what I'm saying to you
[1:23:04] today is that the token must be on
[1:23:08] display and with it comes power and the
[1:23:11] miraculous and with it comes the
[1:23:13] supernatural but if we miss the
[1:23:16] character of the Lamb we've missed it
[1:23:20] all
[1:23:24] can I go on just a little bit further
[1:23:26] Siri thank
[1:23:30] you Jesus suffered mental anguish he
[1:23:33] knew what it was like to be
[1:23:34] misunderstood to be
[1:23:36] mocked his own disciples forsook
[1:23:40] him say brother Matt what was it doing
[1:23:42] it was bringing
[1:23:44] Brokenness but you know what Jesus never
[1:23:46] allowed it to do he never allowed his
[1:23:50] Brokenness to become bitterness
[1:23:55] he knew what it was like to be mocked
[1:23:58] ridiculed and finally they spit on
[1:24:02] him and then they murdered
[1:24:05] him and took his own life so
[1:24:08] valueless and the Bible says yet he
[1:24:11] opened not his
[1:24:12] mouth what was it he was reviled but he
[1:24:16] wouldn't revile
[1:24:18] back even the Apostle Paul had a great
[1:24:21] concern
[1:24:25] for Christians when they seen the
[1:24:27] sufferings in his own Ministry you can
[1:24:29] go look at Acts chapter n when when when
[1:24:32] Paul realizes that these Jews you know
[1:24:35] had believed that if God placed you if
[1:24:37] God called you if God was with you if
[1:24:40] God was pleased with you then you would
[1:24:42] always be blessed and you would never
[1:24:45] suffer and you would never go through
[1:24:47] you know what kind of hard things can I
[1:24:49] give tell you what a prophet said let me
[1:24:51] tell you what a prophet said the prophet
[1:24:52] said the Cloudy Skies
[1:24:56] hello that cloudy size and storms of
[1:25:00] life are no signs of God's
[1:25:04] disapproval neither are bright skies and
[1:25:07] sunny days uh uh you know signs of his
[1:25:10] great approval or his love but the
[1:25:12] prophet says his approval for us is only
[1:25:15] in the
[1:25:18] Beloved the Jews couldn't understand
[1:25:20] this how could God love a man and yet he
[1:25:23] could go through this
[1:25:24] and the Apostle
[1:25:26] Paul understood this picked up on this
[1:25:28] and he begins to say in the book of Acts
[1:25:31] chapter 9 I'm not going to turn to it
[1:25:33] and and he tells them and ananas comes
[1:25:35] and prophesies right after his
[1:25:37] conversion and this is what anas's
[1:25:39] prophet prophecy was in Acts n over the
[1:25:42] life of the Apostle Paul I love this so
[1:25:44] much and he he says here in Acts chapter
[1:25:47] n he says for he is a chosen vessel unto
[1:25:51] me to Bear my name before the Gentiles
[1:25:54] and the children of Israel for I will
[1:25:56] show him I will show him how great
[1:26:00] things he must suffer for my name's
[1:26:06] sake you know what happens reports of
[1:26:08] Paul's suffering goes all over and all
[1:26:11] of the suffering that Paul's getting
[1:26:13] beat he's getting lashed he's thrown
[1:26:14] into
[1:26:15] prison and the Apostle Paul realize this
[1:26:18] and and even some of those Jews you
[1:26:21] know so what did Paul do Paul said
[1:26:25] Timothy and Paul tells Timothy to the
[1:26:27] church at thessalonia you go read the
[1:26:29] book of Thessalonians and Paul says
[1:26:31] Forbe it this is this is 10 this is this
[1:26:34] is 1 Thessalonians 3 so that no man may
[1:26:37] be disturbed by these afflictions for
[1:26:41] you yourself know that we have been
[1:26:46] destined for this right destined this
[1:26:50] was his
[1:26:52] Destiny destined
[1:26:54] to
[1:26:55] suffer destined to Bear the name of
[1:27:00] Christ destined Paul says oh my for you
[1:27:04] yourselves know we have been so that no
[1:27:07] man is Disturbed for we have he says he
[1:27:10] says that we kept telling you in advance
[1:27:12] that we were going to S suffer
[1:27:14] Affliction and it came to pass as you
[1:27:15] know I desire that you faint not at my
[1:27:21] tribulations that's Ephesians 3
[1:27:24] it's why Paul says think it not strange
[1:27:27] for fiery trials that are to try you
[1:27:30] they didn't understand it when it was
[1:27:32] job he said you know come on

[1:28:17] he sits him down and says hey Job listen

[1:28:39] clear conscience you ain't got to get
[1:28:40] excited it's me God you'll never find
[1:28:43] that in your
[1:28:45] Bible you see in this life most of the
[1:28:49] time you only get one side of the
[1:28:52] story and J only was living his everyday
[1:28:56] life living day by day by day day by day
[1:28:59] by day to serving the lord what he
[1:29:01] couldn't see was that in another
[1:29:03] dimension under the at the Throne of God
[1:29:06] there came a a conversation was taking
[1:29:08] place you see job's name come up in
[1:29:11] another dimension that he couldn't hear
[1:29:13] he couldn't see he couldn't communicate
[1:29:15] with and little did job know his name
[1:29:17] had came before his father's thror have
[1:29:19] you considered my servant job there's
[1:29:20] none like him a man who fearth God and
[1:29:22] asseth Evil for he was never sat down
[1:29:25] nobody ever told him no you see God
[1:29:29] doesn't tell you everything brother say
[1:29:31] God doesn't even tell His prophets
[1:29:33] everything that's right he just lets
[1:29:36] them go through life and on this side of
[1:29:38] life there was only one side of the
[1:29:40] story that job got never sat him down so
[1:29:43] when his friends come to him and say job
[1:29:45] what's happening you know what job could
[1:29:46] say honestly I don't
[1:29:47] know I don't
[1:29:49] know you imagine if anybody was turning
[1:29:52] over every stone it was job
[1:29:54] going through his life what have I done
[1:29:56] where have I went wrong what turn did I
[1:29:59] make what did I do wrong how did I go
[1:30:01] where did I go wrong in my life I don't
[1:30:04] understand I can't make sense of
[1:30:08] it and you go read some of the job in
[1:30:10] Job chapter 18 and job begins to get to
[1:30:13] a place let me tell you what began to
[1:30:14] happen to job is it wasn't making sense
[1:30:17] he knew he loved God he knew he served
[1:30:19] God he knew he lived for the Lord yet
[1:30:21] all of this pain was coming and all of
[1:30:23] this trouble was is coming and he gets
[1:30:25] to such a place to where for a while he
[1:30:27] weathers the storm and for a while he
[1:30:29] stays strong and for a while it all
[1:30:31] looks good and then after a while as
[1:30:33] that trial begins to wear on him and
[1:30:35] wear on him and wear on him TR finally
[1:30:38] gets to the place and he says God what
[1:30:41] it been better for me not to be
[1:30:43] born it had been better God you charged
[1:30:46] me as a as a as a as an enemy charges me
[1:30:50] what was it that bitterness begin to set
[1:30:53] into his life
[1:30:54] life because he's trying to make sense
[1:30:56] of what's happening what's happening in
[1:30:59] my life I don't understand what's going
[1:31:03] on why is this taking place what's
[1:31:07] happening you know many times friends we
[1:31:09] question those kind of things in our
[1:31:10] life if we'd be honest it doesn't always
[1:31:13] make
[1:31:15] sense if we'd be real honest and put
[1:31:18] down our angel wings and lay our halo
[1:31:20] aside for a moment we'd admit we don't
[1:31:23] always have have it all figured
[1:31:26] out and sometimes things happen that we
[1:31:28] don't have an answer
[1:31:30] to we don't know
[1:31:32] why and the devil begins to come in our
[1:31:35] life begins to attack us like a bombard
[1:31:39] us and job finally succumbs to some of
[1:31:42] that he says oh God has been better I
[1:31:45] not be born oh Lord job comes to some of
[1:31:49] the displac Andy in his and despondency
[1:31:51] in his life he says oh I go left and I
[1:31:54] don't see him I go right and he's not
[1:31:57] there I look up and I can't find him l i
[1:31:59] search beneath and he's not to be found
[1:32:02] what was Job saying Job saying I'm
[1:32:04] trying to see it I'm trying with
[1:32:06] everything that's within me I'm trying
[1:32:08] to make sense of it I'm looking left I'm
[1:32:10] looking right I'm trying to find
[1:32:11] somewhere the hand of God in all of this
[1:32:14] and job says oh if I just knew where he
[1:32:17] lived if I just knew his address I'd go
[1:32:21] to his house I'd knock on his door I
[1:32:24] know he would open the door and I know
[1:32:26] he would sit me down and I know if I
[1:32:28] just knew where he lived he'd speak kind
[1:32:30] words to me I know it would all make
[1:32:33] sense then all have you ever felt that
[1:32:35] way sometimes friends have you ever felt
[1:32:37] that way can I just be honest I felt
[1:32:39] that way many times in my
[1:32:41] life go through things in my life and
[1:32:44] don't understand stop making sense God
[1:32:47] what did I do where did I go wrong what
[1:32:50] happened in my life oh oh I felt many
[1:32:53] times in my life
[1:32:54] if I could just have a moment with the
[1:32:58] Lord I could just talk to him if I could
[1:33:02] just job says if I could just plead my
[1:33:04] case and tell him if I could just have a
[1:33:08] moment with
[1:33:11] you you know sometimes friends you go
[1:33:14] through things in your
[1:33:17] life and you don't
[1:33:19] realize that the very thing that God's
[1:33:21] doing in your life that you quit
[1:33:23] question and you wonder about and you
[1:33:27] reason over and sometimes God allows
[1:33:30] things that come into our life and you
[1:33:32] think it disqualifies you let me just
[1:33:35] say this friends and I'll be very
[1:33:36] transparent to you today I've preached a
[1:33:38] lot of sermons in my life and I've
[1:33:41] preached sermons and I thought you know
[1:33:42] oh boy that one right there was a really
[1:33:44] good one it's really going to have an
[1:33:46] impact because you know I Lord really I
[1:33:48] thought I'd seen something really good
[1:33:49] come on preachers you know what I'm
[1:33:51] talking you thought you'd seen something
[1:33:52] really good oh boy that that ties over
[1:33:54] here and ties with this and that RI and
[1:33:56] that over oh man when I get out there
[1:33:57] preaching that oh it's just going to oh
[1:33:59] it's going to have such an impact and
[1:34:01] all these things fit over here and and
[1:34:03] this over here and this lines up and oh
[1:34:05] my God it all put together but do you
[1:34:08] know that actually it wasn't those
[1:34:10] sermons that had the greatest impact and
[1:34:12] effect on lives of people but it was
[1:34:15] actually the most simplest things in my
[1:34:19] life when I was able to go through
[1:34:21] suffering and trials in my life life but
[1:34:24] I was able to come and be transparent
[1:34:26] before people and tell how God not only
[1:34:29] to not only how I went to it but how God
[1:34:32] brought me through
[1:34:34] it and it's been some of the what I
[1:34:37] would call the greatest failures of my
[1:34:39] life when I felt like it was all over
[1:34:41] that God somehow brought me through some
[1:34:44] of the darkest times it's been those
[1:34:46] sermons that have been the greatest uh
[1:34:48] weapon to tear the devil's Kingdom
[1:34:51] down you say brother M what are you
[1:34:54] saying I'm saying God wants to take
[1:34:56] those things that you've went through
[1:34:57] and if you will allow him to take you
[1:35:00] through some of the darkest places and
[1:35:02] don't become bitter and don't become
[1:35:04] upset and don't become callous but allow
[1:35:08] God to use it in your
[1:35:13] life it'll actually be the greatest
[1:35:16] weapons because sometimes the thing that
[1:35:19] you thought disqualifies you is actually
[1:35:22] what qualifies you for the
[1:35:25] job and sometimes the greatest
[1:35:28] credentials that you can hold is some of
[1:35:32] the
[1:35:33] failures and moments of what you thought
[1:35:36] was
[1:35:39] defeat I've watched people go through
[1:35:41] the very same
[1:35:43] trial and some get bitter and some get
[1:35:50] better and you could watch a family go
[1:35:52] through the exact same trial and one of
[1:35:56] them uses what God put them through to
[1:35:59] build and Def further the kingdom of God
[1:36:01] that's right and the other allows it to
[1:36:03] become to make them bitter and angry
[1:36:07] that's right you say what was the
[1:36:08] difference it wasn't the trial and it
[1:36:10] wasn't
[1:36:11] God it was what you did with your
[1:36:20] trial job what's happening I don't know
[1:36:25] what's going on God if I just had a
[1:36:27] moment with you if I could just knock on
[1:36:30] your door if I could just take a moment
[1:36:33] and job says oh if I I went left I went
[1:36:35] right and I can't perceive him but you
[1:36:38] know what job finally came to brother
[1:36:39] job job finally said I may not be able
[1:36:42] to see him I may not be able to find him
[1:36:45] but here's what I know he knows the way
[1:36:47] that I
[1:36:49] take in other words I may not be able to
[1:36:52] see God right now but here's what I know
[1:36:54] God can see
[1:36:57] me and job says and I may know listen
[1:37:00] friends there might have been only one
[1:37:02] side of the story let me just say this
[1:37:04] as I feel the inspiration of the Holy
[1:37:05] Ghost you may only get one side of the
[1:37:08] story on this life but there's coming a
[1:37:10] day there's coming a day where you'll
[1:37:13] get the other side of your story and
[1:37:15] it'll all make sense on the other side
[1:37:18] there will be no more
[1:37:21] questions hallu
[1:37:24] because job went his whole life you
[1:37:27] realize that you read the book of Job
[1:37:29] and many people think you know somewhere
[1:37:30] in job you know most people don't get
[1:37:32] past job 20 if they get past that they
[1:37:34] don't get past job 30 they just stop
[1:37:36] reading but keep going can I challenge
[1:37:38] you to go a little bit further in the
[1:37:39] Book of Job what you'll find is that God
[1:37:42] actually never sat him down in his life
[1:37:47] and said okay
[1:37:49] job now I'm going to tell you now I'm
[1:37:52] going to explain expl it to you job why
[1:37:55] you went through what you went through
[1:37:56] do you know you'll never find that in
[1:37:58] your
[1:38:00] Bible you'll find job goes his entire
[1:38:03] life to his grave and he finally gets to
[1:38:06] the place to where he's not making sense
[1:38:08] of any of it and you know what God
[1:38:10] actually tells him God brings him you go
[1:38:13] read it through job I don't have time
[1:38:15] and I'm not going to turn to it today
[1:38:17] but you go read and job God actually
[1:38:19] brings job and and and job's all just in
[1:38:22] a mess and his mind and God says job I
[1:38:25] want you to think about something here
[1:38:27] for a
[1:38:28] moment I want you to consider here's job
[1:38:32] and all of his distress here's job all
[1:38:34] messed up needs an answer and God
[1:38:37] finally says who is this that darkeneth
[1:38:38] the counsil of
[1:38:40] God stand up that I may talk to you like

[1:40:27] killed by that animal than any animal in
[1:40:29] Africa a a creature that will just

[1:42:14] my life God says job I want you to

[1:43:01] job and job never got to knock on God's
[1:43:04] door oh but one day God came knocking on
[1:43:07] job's door brother Bram dramatized it
[1:43:10] and said there was God as he knocked on
[1:43:11] paradise's door and Ezekiel stands and
[1:43:14] Abraham stands but here stands job what
[1:43:17] was it he went his whole life but now
[1:43:20] all of his questions and all of his long
[1:43:23] nights and all of his tears that he
[1:43:26] cried here he
[1:43:31] was and God says that's my
[1:43:35] redeemer that's
[1:43:38] him oh boy Siri says I have 55 seconds
[1:43:42] brother
[1:43:44] Tim can I go just five more minutes and
[1:43:48] if I go five past that that'll be okay
[1:43:50] too right give me extra Grace
[1:43:54] I just want to conclude
[1:43:58] this broken but not
[1:44:02] bitter you see it's the Bible actually
[1:44:05] says that a root of bitterness lest a
[1:44:07] root of bitterness spring
[1:44:10] up don't stop there because bitterness
[1:44:13] doesn't stop there because the scripture
[1:44:16] says less a root of bitterness come and
[1:44:19] defile
[1:44:21] many you see that bitterness doesn't
[1:44:24] just affect you it affects everything
[1:44:28] around
[1:44:30] you in fact in their life it would be
[1:44:33] notice brother brandom as he comes to
[1:44:35] this stage or this place in his life we
[1:44:37] could say and you know this story very
[1:44:40] well I just want to just read it to you
[1:44:42] here for a moment as brother Brandon
[1:44:43] preaches this message standing in the
[1:44:45] Gap and he begins to tell about this
[1:44:49] story this dream that about Fletcher Bry
[1:44:52] and and brother Roy is having this dream
[1:44:54] and and brother brandham says he gets
[1:44:56] this call from brother brother Roy and
[1:44:58] brother Roy's all in a mess he's
[1:45:00] thinking oh brother brandham oh I just I
[1:45:01] was screaming for you brother Bill come
[1:45:03] back brother Bill and he says we were
[1:45:05] sitting there notice this he says we
[1:45:07] were sitting there and he says and he
[1:45:09] said and he and I look like in Jerusalem
[1:45:12] at the Lord's communion table and I was
[1:45:14] talking he couldn't understand it
[1:45:15] brother Roy said him present looking at
[1:45:16] me now out in Arizona sent me a letter I
[1:45:19] called him back and said you were
[1:45:19] sitting there brother Bram and I saw
[1:45:22] that big pill of light come in and get
[1:45:25] you and take you away from the Lord's
[1:45:27] table and you went Westward cuz he was
[1:45:31] sitting on the east side watching me go
[1:45:33] west and this light come in and take it
[1:45:35] out now notice this dream brother Roy
[1:45:37] has here's brother brandham he's at the
[1:45:39] head of the communion table and then he
[1:45:41] sees that light that Pillar of Fire that
[1:45:42] you see in that picture brother bam says
[1:45:44] and he says I've seen that thing whirl
[1:45:46] in and grab you and take you brother bam
[1:45:48] out of the room he said said it was one
[1:45:51] morning like it was a vision two or
[1:45:52] three in the morning and he said I
[1:45:54] screamed look like for days brother Bill
[1:45:56] come back Roy and I been real brothers
[1:45:59] we lived to hunt together just brothers
[1:46:00] he screamed for me till he was horse in
[1:46:02] his throat come back bring him back
[1:46:05] bring him back here come that Pillar of
[1:46:08] Fire coming back or a cloud back and he
[1:46:12] set me at the head of the table notice
[1:46:17] and I had been changed
[1:46:23] it was a mystery to brother Roy me being
[1:46:28] changed to look different brother Adam
[1:46:32] takes a little sticky I think it is a
[1:46:34] little note and he writes on that note
[1:46:38] being
[1:46:39] changed and he says I'm going to take it
[1:46:41] I lay this up here for something I want
[1:46:43] to remember being changed when I give
[1:46:46] him the interpretation of it now many of
[1:46:49] you would think if you just had to guess
[1:46:52] my goodness there's the communion table
[1:46:54] he's looks like he's in Jerusalem and
[1:46:56] he's sitting there there's the pillar of
[1:46:57] fire he goes W he takes him and and
[1:46:59] Westward and you're thinking you know
[1:47:01] it's something ethereal there's
[1:47:02] something to do with some of the
[1:47:03] Mysteries and and and maybe it's about
[1:47:05] the Feast of the trumpets or about the
[1:47:07] Seven Seals or something God's going to
[1:47:09] reveal I want you to notice what this
[1:47:11] Vision actually meant when brother bham
[1:47:13] says you had been brother Roy says
[1:47:14] brother bham you had been changed so
[1:47:17] what changed in the vision at with
[1:47:20] brother brandham that took him from the
[1:47:22] Comm Union table and sat him back and
[1:47:25] put him at the head of the table brother
[1:47:28] bam says now I'm preaching to myself
[1:47:30] could we stand and see a human being
[1:47:32] that's blind physically blind and know
[1:47:34] that he's walking over a cliff could we
[1:47:36] in our sto state of mind that we're in
[1:47:38] this morning could we stand and see a
[1:47:41] blind man walk over a cliff blind and
[1:47:43] not try to warn him could you do that
[1:47:46] tonight friends a blind man hello
[1:47:48] anybody could you allow a blind man to
[1:47:51] walk over a cliff brother theom says and
[1:47:53] not warning it would be so cruel we
[1:47:55] would be so indifferent in our heart
[1:47:58] could you imagine a person getting so
[1:48:01] indifferent that he could almost laugh
[1:48:03] and see a blind man that cannot see and
[1:48:06] help himself deliberately walk over a
[1:48:08] cliff that would be bad a bad thing to
[1:48:10] do nothing about it what are my brethren
[1:48:12] R over I just want to make this
[1:48:15] confession and humbly say that just
[1:48:19] about what I was doing or fixing to do
[1:48:23] I've been preaching for years I'd become
[1:48:25] an old man an old veteran preacher and I
[1:48:28] had a lot of hard battles and maybe I'm
[1:48:33] scarred all CAU up on the inside from
[1:48:36] fights because my lot that the lord gave
[1:48:38] me was not to kiss the babies and marry
[1:48:40] the young and bury the old but it was to
[1:48:42] hold a two-handed sword at the
[1:48:44] Battlefront against the Ws of paganism
[1:48:46] and demonology and the powers of
[1:48:48] darkness and fight it with the word of
[1:48:49] God till I seen the enemy defeated I
[1:48:51] been cut
[1:48:53] many times now I met a Christian this
[1:48:56] great country right under Alaska and I
[1:48:58] had made up in my mind that being I'd
[1:49:00] left here and going west that I would
[1:49:01] take my wife and kind of trap her into
[1:49:06] something now don't you guys get any
[1:49:09] ideas I was going to trap her into
[1:49:12] something I'd get her up there and
[1:49:14] become a God if the Lord wanted me to do
[1:49:17] something I let my hair grow out i' my
[1:49:19] whiskers i' go back there and be a god
[1:49:21] there's only about two three Indians
[1:49:22] live back there there just been a guide
[1:49:23] him help Bud and Lord wanted me to do
[1:49:25] anything then I'd say all right Lord it
[1:49:26] give me a vision I slip on out then i'
[1:49:29] being nervous I say this kind of quietly
[1:49:32] maybe erotically type of person I'm
[1:49:33] knowing that I was in insufficient at
[1:49:35] the beginning for the job oh my as many
[1:49:37] as complained that had to do was hard
[1:49:38] but I thought God why did you call
[1:49:40] somebody that could have done it he says
[1:49:42] the people just won't listen to me I
[1:49:43] failed to do what I should have done
[1:49:44] somewhere because they won't listen
[1:49:46] let's go on before leaving here I might
[1:49:48] drop this in and we'll hurry I Dreamed a
[1:49:50] funny dream and I dream hoping my
[1:49:52] brother gets a hold of this doesn't hurt
[1:49:53] his feelings I hope I don't hurt my wife
[1:49:55] who's sitting present now but she knows
[1:49:57] it many months ago around October
[1:49:59] November I dreamed that I was roaming
[1:50:01] out in the dark listen to this well I
[1:50:03] had no place to go and nobody cared for
[1:50:05] me and I'd become a bum just a bum and I
[1:50:09] was cold looked in the distance saw a
[1:50:12] fire when I got over there as was a city
[1:50:14] dump the ditches and the fire was in the
[1:50:15] ditches between the ditches with slick
[1:50:17] where bums would sleep to keep warm keep
[1:50:19] from freezing between the fires on a
[1:50:20] cold winter night and I was cold I
[1:50:22] walked from this fire to get warm it was
[1:50:23] laying full of bums didn't see anything
[1:50:25] them but they all had like stalls or
[1:50:26] places where they're sleeping I saw my
[1:50:27] brother-in-law F Fletcher Bry when I
[1:50:29] woke up Fletch said to me he said in the
[1:50:31] dream he said Billy I'll hunt you a
[1:50:32] place brother Bill you fed my children
[1:50:34] when they were hungry he said Daddy then
[1:50:35] I'll find you a place here to keep warm
[1:50:37] we went walking by the bums place and
[1:50:38] finally come to a place he said I'll sit
[1:50:40] down here and said I'll walk up here see
[1:50:42] if I could find a place I looked out
[1:50:44] into the dark cold night and I thought
[1:50:47] think of
[1:50:49] it think of it one time God Almighty let
[1:50:53] me lead his church one time he let me
[1:50:56] preach his gospel and see Soul saved men
[1:50:59] and women come from around the world to
[1:51:01] speak with me for a few
[1:51:03] moments and here I
[1:51:06] am I'm now a bum nobody wants me and I'm
[1:51:12] cold what must I do I told my wife maybe
[1:51:16] it means fleshes brother M's trying to
[1:51:18] figure this out and he says uh you know
[1:51:20] I'd preached for about 35 years
[1:51:23] in the last 15 to 18 years I've done
[1:51:26] nothing but just to the Lord I've tried
[1:51:29] to live so close to him not say a word
[1:51:32] till he told me first everything I come
[1:51:34] down from Canada Fred brother Roy told
[1:51:35] me his dream he and I Banks Road
[1:51:38] together just before we separated
[1:51:40] brother bandam says and if I I'll live
[1:51:42] back in the wilderness be his prophet he
[1:51:43] wants to send me somewhere he's not
[1:51:45] using me then you know I was sure to
[1:51:47] catch some fine fish and do some things
[1:51:50] of course that was kind of a self
[1:51:52] attitude because I wanted to do that it
[1:51:55] isn't exactly the thing to do no now I
[1:51:57] had made that up in notice my
[1:52:01] mind doesn't it say the Holy Spirit told
[1:52:04] him to do this it's amazing how many
[1:52:05] plans we
[1:52:09] concoct now notice he's not thinking of
[1:52:11] anything sinful he's not thinking about
[1:52:14] going to the living some life you know s
[1:52:16] separate second life going to the bar
[1:52:18] it's none of that all it is I want you
[1:52:21] to catch this
[1:52:23] is just a little
[1:52:25] detour this seems harmless brother Adam
[1:52:29] says you know i' made up in my mind to
[1:52:30] do that got up about 4:00 started
[1:52:33] driving Billy was sleeping went to a
[1:52:34] place I was thinking on you know what
[1:52:36] one of these days when just get a wife
[1:52:37] up here I won't tell her I'm going to do
[1:52:38] but I'd get up there and I'm going to
[1:52:39] tell her I love this place so well not
[1:52:41] of us no need of us going anywhere let's
[1:52:43] just stay here it's back from
[1:52:44] civilization 1100 miles from anywhere
[1:52:46] way in the wilderness I thought won't
[1:52:48] that be fine I won't have to get a
[1:52:51] haircut
[1:52:55] now don't you boys getting the ideas
[1:52:58] now I won't have to get a haircut I
[1:53:01] won't have to dress up I'll just be a
[1:53:04] regular Mountaineer what I always wanted
[1:53:07] to be I said got some guns and people
[1:53:10] give me and be a God Like You never
[1:53:13] heard of I'll just love it the Lord
[1:53:16] tells me to go down tells run out there
[1:53:18] and tell him come back again help Bud
[1:53:19] really we really have a real place
[1:53:21] brother says oh I was thinking on
[1:53:29] that it said carry out your plans carry
[1:53:33] out your
[1:53:35] plans and you'll be like that that
[1:53:39] bum I said Lord I don't want to be like
[1:53:42] that said your wife will go too she
[1:53:43] won't live up in them Hills like that
[1:53:45] and you'll become a bum just as the
[1:53:47] dream showed you you would I said I
[1:53:50] don't want to I I I I I I don't want to
[1:53:52] have to live like that I want to do
[1:53:53] something different I was told you to
[1:53:55] call me be a prophet I'll live in the
[1:53:56] winers like a prophet but I was using my
[1:53:58] own excuse so I can hump my own good I
[1:54:00] let the sick lay I want the Lord to tell
[1:54:02] me where to go and not to that's wrong I
[1:54:04] built notice I had built myself a
[1:54:09] complex I want you to key in on this
[1:54:12] because you can build a
[1:54:15] complex doesn't just happen overnight
[1:54:17] but you feed that thing and you feed
[1:54:20] that thing and before you know it it's
[1:54:22] your
[1:54:24] reality because the people didn't hear
[1:54:26] my message and if God forbid I'll try to
[1:54:28] brother BR says try to compare myself to
[1:54:29] Moses but the people wouldn't listen to
[1:54:30] him to come to live him so he just left
[1:54:31] him alone with the wildness but God
[1:54:33] turned him around and these Ricky and
[1:54:35] retas that have so sassed the word I've
[1:54:36] called them Ricky and Retta God give me
[1:54:38] to understand I shouldn't do that
[1:54:40] because many of them are still as
[1:54:41] children they can't help because they
[1:54:42] act so different some of these cold
[1:54:44] formal churches got the spirit upon them
[1:54:46] there has got them that Spirit upon them
[1:54:48] there as much prison as Israel was in
[1:54:50] prison just as much as Moses went down
[1:54:51] to deliver them from slavery human
[1:54:53] beings that love Jesus Christ would
[1:54:55] serve him if they only knew what to
[1:54:56] serve him by and they're in bondage
[1:54:57] under denominationalism tells them don't
[1:54:59] do this and don't do that brother bham
[1:55:01] says oh he says notice this here
[1:55:04] underlined and I wanted to bring this to
[1:55:07] you listen to this I wanted to bring
[1:55:10] this to you so you would see and show
[1:55:12] you the mistake that a man can make yet
[1:55:17] being
[1:55:21] sincere just just a little
[1:55:25] detour just a little
[1:55:29] deviation not sin not to
[1:55:33] backslide just to check out from the
[1:55:36] pressure to step off make an alternate
[1:55:40] plan and that one detour would have
[1:55:44] wrecked his
[1:55:45] life I'm so glad that the grace of
[1:55:50] Jesus is greater than any
[1:55:52] human fry or fragility of the human mind
[1:55:57] I'm so glad that the grace of Jesus
[1:55:59] triumphs my
[1:56:02] stubbornness sometimes I'm so glad that
[1:56:05] the grace of Jesus overcomes
[1:56:10] me and he says Oh Brother Roy Moses lost
[1:56:14] the fing of the people because they
[1:56:15] wouldn't listen to him and brother Roy
[1:56:18] you see your dream I can't go with a
[1:56:21] Ministry like that notice until I feel
[1:56:25] different in my heart no matter if God
[1:56:30] did tell
[1:56:31] me but that is that
[1:56:36] change what was that change brother
[1:56:40] Matt just the feeling in his heart
[1:56:45] towards
[1:56:48] people God intended the Brokenness but
[1:56:52] he never sent the
[1:56:56] bitterness and brother bham had allowed
[1:56:59] that bitterness because people wouldn't
[1:57:01] listen to him to change his attitude and
[1:57:04] brother brandham says that's that
[1:57:07] change
[1:57:08] amazing that he's removed from the
[1:57:11] communion table but when his heart is
[1:57:14] changed he's put at the head of the
[1:57:17] table that is that change
[1:57:22] brother Roy
[1:57:25] something's got to change me I wonder if
[1:57:28] you'd be honest enough in your heart and
[1:57:29] I'll be honest tonight to raise my hand
[1:57:32] and resonate with these words and say
[1:57:35] something's got to change
[1:57:39] me oh friends listen you've got to be
[1:57:43] changed one day where our body's going
[1:57:45] to change you know what that'll be a
[1:57:47] result of you changing every day in this
[1:57:50] part of your soul that's right
[1:57:53] I could say something's got to change me
[1:57:55] in my heart brother bham says oh he says
[1:57:59] until I can get that feeling until I can
[1:58:02] get that feeling he says oh pray that
[1:58:04] God will place into my heart that
[1:58:07] something that I lost out there in that
[1:58:10] complex it's so easy to build a complex
[1:58:14] it's so easy like job when you don't
[1:58:19] understand what's happening and it
[1:58:22] doesn't make
[1:58:24] sense it's so so powerful musicians
[1:58:28] could you come I'm going to
[1:58:30] close something so powerful I wish I had
[1:58:34] the illustration I could put up before
[1:58:35] you that I I seen and I I didn't have
[1:58:37] time to put it up but it's something
[1:58:40] that was so
[1:58:41] powerful and it speaks
[1:58:43] about what the what's in every living
[1:58:47] plant you take a tree you take a flower
[1:58:50] you take any kind of botney Life any
[1:58:53] nature something that's so powerful
[1:58:56] inside of that plan In The Presence of
[1:58:57] Jehovah if you could play that just
[1:59:01] softly something that's so powerful and
[1:59:05] I'm in no means any kind of a botnus or
[1:59:07] know anything about that kind of thing
[1:59:11] but do you know that there's something
[1:59:13] that makes every plant grow every single
[1:59:16] plant every living thing that you see
[1:59:18] it's something in a flower whether it's
[1:59:20] a tree or a bush
[1:59:22] it's something called a meristem tissue
[1:59:25] go look this up it's called meristem
[1:59:28] tissue Marist stem it's actually the
[1:59:31] same thing that we have called stem
[1:59:33] cells and a stem cell is what causes
[1:59:36] something to grow in your body do you
[1:59:38] realize that when that baby is born and
[1:59:41] it's and its life is in the mother the
[1:59:43] womb of that mother that as as the
[1:59:45] things as nutrients come into the body
[1:59:48] it's at the stem cell line that
[1:59:51] decisions are made made and it says that
[1:59:53] would make a good nose that would make
[1:59:55] good hair that would make a good ear
[1:59:57] that would make a good toe that would
[1:59:59] make this that's where it's it's all at
[2:00:00] and in a tree in botney life there's
[2:00:02] something called meristem tissue and
[2:00:05] what that is is inside of a plant
[2:00:08] everything that the plant is receiving
[2:00:10] and every L and every living plant all
[2:00:13] the nutrients don't know how it does it
[2:00:15] you this is just God in nature but
[2:00:18] everything that it receives and and you
[2:00:20] could look at if you a tree and you can
[2:00:23] see the knots I can actually point out
[2:00:25] that where that meristem tissue made a
[2:00:28] decision catch this please it made a
[2:00:30] choice because it received something
[2:00:33] might have been a fire that had went
[2:00:35] through might have been a flood might
[2:00:36] have been not enough Sun might have been
[2:00:38] put under some kind of thing that CS it
[2:00:40] you know didn't get enough water but a
[2:00:43] decision was made at that meristem line
[2:00:46] and the choice was either I'll grow up
[2:00:50] or I'll die and push down it's
[2:00:53] incredible when you look at
[2:00:55] this because it actually makes the
[2:00:58] choice in that tree it's where a
[2:01:01] decision a particular
[2:01:04] spot in that tree or that that
[2:01:07] flower it's it's you just say brother M
[2:01:09] what is it it's that decision that's
[2:01:13] made on what it's going to do with what
[2:01:17] it receives that's right listen friends
[2:01:20] it can't control what it receives but
[2:01:23] it's got a choice to make on what will
[2:01:27] you do with what you
[2:01:31] receive let me just say this in your
[2:01:34] life you will have a thousand chances to
[2:01:36] get angry you will have a thousand
[2:01:38] opportunities to get bitter you'll have
[2:01:40] a thousand chances to get upset you'll
[2:01:43] have a million opportunities to get
[2:01:45] revenge and get even and get
[2:01:48] back but you also have the choice
[2:01:53] to be identified with your
[2:01:56] lamb and you say you don't know what
[2:01:58] they did to me brother match you don't
[2:01:59] know what they said and when they said
[2:02:01] this and they said that you don't know
[2:02:02] what they were me all this is my
[2:02:03] opportunity to know you know what this
[2:02:06] is this is God orchestrated in the
[2:02:08] moment for you to exercise true
[2:02:13] power cuz true power is the power Jesus
[2:02:17] exercise when he can say father forgive
[2:02:20] them for they know not what they
[2:02:23] do true
[2:02:25] power is not to speak them out of
[2:02:29] existence true power is to look beyond
[2:02:32] what you see out externally and look at
[2:02:35] the heart that's lost and needs the Lord
[2:02:38] Jesus Oh friends I know this is such a
[2:02:41] simple message but it's just what the
[2:02:42] Lord told me to preach here
[2:02:45] tonight that tree has no ability to
[2:02:48] determine what it what it receives but
[2:02:51] it can make the choice on what it's
[2:02:54] going to
[2:02:55] do with what it
[2:02:57] gets do you know that in the body they
[2:03:00] have determined that actually cancer
[2:03:03] comes you take cancer any disease you
[2:03:06] want to name when an
[2:03:09] unidentified object comes in when an
[2:03:11] unidentified cell and when that stem
[2:03:14] cell doesn't identify what it's going to
[2:03:16] be and it just leaves it unidentified it
[2:03:18] can grow into into problems
[2:03:22] and let me tell you what the Bible says
[2:03:24] the Bible says that you're to take every
[2:03:26] thought you don't leave any thought just
[2:03:29] floating around in your mind but you
[2:03:31] take any thought that is contrary to
[2:03:34] this word and you bring it subject to
[2:03:36] the power of the Holy Ghost you don't
[2:03:39] unidentify anything you say God I might
[2:03:41] have went through it I might not
[2:03:43] understand it but your grace is
[2:03:44] sufficient for me Lord in my weakness
[2:03:47] that you are made strong as the Apostle
[2:03:49] Paul was told Paul will you take it from
[2:03:52] me I asked the Lord Thrice and brother
[2:03:54] ROM said God said no Paul I'm not going
[2:03:56] to take it but here's what your message
[2:03:58] is going to be my grace is sufficient
[2:04:01] for your Thorn
[2:04:03] Paul in other words my grace is
[2:04:07] enough you don't need anything else but
[2:04:11] my grace could you stand and close your
[2:04:14] eyes and bow your heads here with me all
[2:04:16] over the building
[2:04:24] it's not what's coming in it's not what
[2:04:27] you receive it's what you do with what
[2:04:31] you
[2:04:32] get you can choose to be better or you
[2:04:36] can choose to be
[2:04:39] bitter you can choose like
[2:04:43] Joseph who could look at his brothers
[2:04:46] and say what the
[2:04:48] enemy has meant for evil
[2:04:52] I
[2:04:54] choose I make a choice to let God use
[2:05:00] it for
[2:05:02] good in fact Joseph says to the saving
[2:05:06] to the Redemption you say brother Matt
[2:05:09] what are you saying I'm saying that God
[2:05:11] can take that thing that came in your
[2:05:13] life and if you will let God if you will
[2:05:16] let go and let God take it he can take
[2:05:20] that thing that Satan sent to destroy
[2:05:23] you and God can take it and use it as a
[2:05:27] weapon to tear the devil's Kingdom down
[2:05:29] in your
[2:05:30] life he can use it to give you a
[2:05:33] testimony that will shake the gates of
[2:05:36] hell it's all what you choose to do with
[2:05:40] your
[2:05:42] pain it's no question whether
[2:05:44] tribulation will come the Bible's clear
[2:05:47] you say brother Matt what do you believe
[2:05:48] that we're just all here in this life
[2:05:50] just going to suffer all have no friends
[2:05:51] that's not what I'm preaching to you as
[2:05:54] brother B was asked is tribulation
[2:05:56] coming for the bride is persecution no
[2:05:58] the next thing is the rapture for the
[2:06:00] bride but friends do you realize that
[2:06:03] that Christlike nature as our Prophet
[2:06:05] told us comes through human suffering
[2:06:08] and
[2:06:09] trial and you've got a choice you've got
[2:06:13] a choice Rachel as that baby was born
[2:06:16] and Rachel at her last dying breath as
[2:06:19] she's going to name that child her last
[2:06:21] dying breath as she goes out in
[2:06:23] suffering and anguish and she says his
[2:06:26] name shall be Boni which means the child
[2:06:29] of my sorrow but do you know want to
[2:06:31] know what happened a powerful thing
[2:06:33] happened in that moment because that
[2:06:35] child would have been raised as bonai
[2:06:38] and his name would have represented all
[2:06:39] of his mother's complexes and I would
[2:06:42] have passed down all of the mom's Pro
[2:06:44] problems and grief and and and and and
[2:06:46] and issues but a father named Jacob
[2:06:49] stepped in and said his name shall not
[2:06:51] be called bononi but his name Shall be
[2:06:54] Called Benjamin for Benjamin means the
[2:06:57] son of my right hand what was it at the
[2:07:00] moment he could have been named the he
[2:07:02] could have just continued the pain of
[2:07:05] the last generation but someone was
[2:07:07] going to come in and step in and say I
[2:07:09] choose to not pass down my pain and my
[2:07:12] grief and my trouble I choose today to
[2:07:16] say God I'm going to allow what you've
[2:07:18] sent to my life to bring victory and not
[2:07:22] defeat I'm going to allow what you've s
[2:07:25] in my life to push up and to cause
[2:07:28] growth and not stuned growth oh how many
[2:07:32] hands would go up and say Lord Jesus I
[2:07:34] accept it
[2:07:36] tonight accept it
[2:07:39] Lord Lord God I know father above all
[2:07:44] else I know Lord God that you had me go
[2:07:48] this direction tonight
[2:07:51] I I know you had a purpose
[2:07:55] Lord I pray God that the word would find
[2:07:58] its resting place in the heart of Faith
[2:08:01] to your
[2:08:03] children may we realize Lord
[2:08:08] God as Sons and Daughters of
[2:08:13] God that there's many
[2:08:15] crosses in this
[2:08:17] life but all the blessings far outweigh
[2:08:21] the
[2:08:23] crosses as David said forget not his
[2:08:28] benefits Lord oh the crosses are great
[2:08:31] but the blessings are many much more
[2:08:33] than all of the trials as Paul said the
[2:08:36] light suffering temporary momentary
[2:08:39] suffering of this life is not worthy to
[2:08:42] be compared to the glory which shall be
[2:08:45] revealed in
[2:08:47] us may we realize tonight Lord as Sons
[2:08:50] and Daughters of God that healing true
[2:08:53] healing doesn't just come Lord God as a
[2:08:55] one-time
[2:08:57] oneoff but God your desire is you said I
[2:09:00] come to to bind up I've torn but I'm
[2:09:03] going to
[2:09:04] heal I've I've ripped apart but I'm
[2:09:07] going to bind
[2:09:09] up and may the Holy Ghost come tonight
[2:09:12] Lord Jesus with healing in his wings I
[2:09:13] wonder I just feel the presence of the
[2:09:15] Lord now I wonder if there'd be somebody
[2:09:17] maybe you just want to identify and say
[2:09:19] Lord God I believe your word was
[2:09:22] speaking right to my heart and I want to
[2:09:25] I want to let you know Lord Jesus I'm
[2:09:27] sensitive enough to say God I've heard
[2:09:29] your voice I'm not going to I'm not
[2:09:31] going to allow that complex to be built
[2:09:34] I'm not going to allow layers to come
[2:09:35] and feed that thing but today Lord today
[2:09:38] I'm taking all of my bitterness and I'm
[2:09:41] letting it go I'm casting it out of my
[2:09:44] life I'm dropping it here oh God and I
[2:09:47] say tonight I'll go out not bitter
[2:09:50] Brokenness is what you you called called
[2:09:52] me to but not bitterness
[2:09:54] Lord let me
[2:09:56] realize I can lay it down I've got the
[2:10:00] power to lay it down
