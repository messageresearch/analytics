[36:28] in the way ii corinthians 10 and verse 3
[36:32] it says for though we walk in the flesh
[36:34] we do not war after the flesh
[36:36] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[36:38] carnal but mighty through god to the
[36:41] pulling down of strongholds
[36:44] casting down imaginations and every high
[36:47] thing that exalted itself against the
[36:49] knowledge of god
[36:50] and bringing into captivity every
[36:54] thought to the obedience of christ
[36:57] we let you be seated
[37:06] also would just like to read first
[37:07] corinthians 2 16 says for who
[37:10] hath known the mind of the lord that we
[37:12] may instruct him
[37:14] but we have the mind of christ
[37:18] now we know that we can only have his
[37:19] mind by being born
[37:21] amen into the family of god amen to take
[37:24] on his dna
[37:25] and to take on his thoughts to take on
[37:27] his thinking it only comes by the holy
[37:29] ghost taking preeminence over our lives
[37:32] now i i just seen this quote that was
[37:35] actually up
[37:36] on the uh overhead as as was watching it
[37:38] play through
[37:39] i just want to read it again because i
[37:41] thought it was very wonderful even
[37:43] with what we're speaking tonight now i
[37:44] would just like to continue on casting
[37:46] down imaginations
[37:48] it says the first thing i want went to
[37:50] the to a person and found their
[37:52] birthplace
[37:53] and what sign they were born under and
[37:56] could tell what their birth was
[37:58] which way it set in their natural nature
[38:01] sets them in a certain line now he's
[38:03] saying your natural birth what sign
[38:06] you're born under
[38:07] sets you in a certain line but when they
[38:10] are reborn again
[38:11] they're over in another nature amen when
[38:14] you find
[38:16] into this nature the first nature inside
[38:18] conscience
[38:19] inside of reason all those things but
[38:22] once you move into the that's a natural
[38:24] birth
[38:25] but once you move into the other amen
[38:27] there's something different
[38:29] and and he goes on he says he said the
[38:31] inside you know would say oh i just know
[38:33] when you hear the word of god it says oh
[38:35] i just know
[38:36] your mind begins to to come from the
[38:38] inside as your
[38:39] heart begins to line up to the word it
[38:41] says oh i just know
[38:42] it lines up with the scripture and said
[38:45] they'll start to
[38:46] do it but the first thing you know satan
[38:48] on this outside will
[38:50] show all kinds of defects in it
[38:53] he'll show every kind of loophole in it
[38:55] he'll show all kinds of things
[38:57] and then they'll begin to say well i
[38:59] guess and they begin to reason what are
[39:01] they doing
[39:01] they're listening to satan he said but
[39:04] you've got to take that
[39:05] inside something what's on the inside of
[39:08] you the scriptural
[39:09] and don't let satan stand anywhere
[39:14] hallelujah that's his duty to stand
[39:16] there and pound at you like that
[39:19] but don't you listen to him hallelujah
[39:22] that goes for in church or wherever
[39:24] you're at
[39:24] amen satan comes at you every day of
[39:27] your life in your dreams
[39:28] at night all kinds of to any time that
[39:30] he can find a little place to come into
[39:33] amen to get into your thoughts into your
[39:35] thinking you know i mean i i i woke up
[39:38] in the morning i mean he's ever had a
[39:39] dream that seemed so real
[39:41] and you thought man did i really do that
[39:43] and then satan comes and he tries to
[39:45] anoint dreams he tries to come into
[39:47] your conscience your subconscious to do
[39:49] everything he can
[39:50] to distract you or to or or to show you
[39:54] things or
[39:54] little flaws or little of defects in it
[39:57] but there's no defect in the word of god
[40:00] there's no defect in the spirit of god
[40:03] there's no defect in the life of god
[40:05] amen what is it satan is just trying to
[40:08] find a place to stand
[40:09] and he will stand there as long as you
[40:11] allow him to stand there
[40:13] he'll stand in your thoughts as long as
[40:15] you allow him to stand in your thoughts
[40:17] he'll he'll stand in your reasoning as
[40:19] long as you allow him to stand in your
[40:21] reasoning
[40:22] he'll stand and he'll stand wherever he
[40:24] can find a place
[40:25] wherever whatever little crack whatever
[40:27] every little crevice he'll try to find
[40:29] that place to
[40:30] pound at you to try to get you off of
[40:33] the path amen
[40:34] but what is it when those things come
[40:36] you have to cast them down
[40:38] you have to push them aside you have to
[40:39] say no that might have been the old man
[40:41] but that's not the new man
[40:43] i might have been with my brother
[40:45] timothy or timothy pruitt a long time
[40:46] ago
[40:47] but that's not timothy pruitt today that
[40:49] might be this
[40:50] that might have been me back in that day
[40:52] and what i used to do and
[40:53] how i used to think and how i used to
[40:55] act or how i used to believe or what i
[40:57] used to do
[40:58] but that's not me no more because i can
[41:00] point to a place where my life changed
[41:03] i can point to a place where i step from
[41:05] the natural into the supernatural
[41:08] i can point to a place where the holy
[41:09] ghost came and took preeminence upon our
[41:12] lives
[41:12] to where we don't think like we used to
[41:14] think thank god we don't think like the
[41:16] world thinks today
[41:17] amen we don't even think how the world
[41:19] used to think 30 years ago or 40 years
[41:21] ago
[41:22] we we don't think how the world thinks
[41:24] we think how christ thinks
[41:27] the mind of christ so it's very
[41:29] important no matter where you're at
[41:31] to get your mind upon the lord amen to
[41:33] get your mind upon
[41:34] his doings and his word and his thinking
[41:38] amen
[41:38] you know here's another one here as we
[41:41] go into this he says
[41:42] i think it's a great thing as we could
[41:44] look at a christian life
[41:46] and there had to be a bridge to span the
[41:48] way for the human race
[41:50] to leave this world somewhere someday
[41:52] and there was no one could do it no
[41:54] angel no archangel no seraphim no
[41:56] cherubim
[41:57] nothing could do it but god himself came
[42:00] down
[42:01] in the form of a man to bridge away to
[42:04] make a way
[42:05] for amen from the grave to glory and it
[42:07] sure
[42:08] showed the reflection every listen
[42:10] there's every
[42:11] nerve in his body every thought in his
[42:14] mind
[42:15] every power that was in him was tested
[42:18] by the enemy
[42:20] amen well you know how your nerves get
[42:22] every nerve in his body
[42:25] every thought in his mind every power
[42:28] that was in him
[42:29] was tested by the enemy let me let you
[42:31] in on something
[42:32] it's the same enemy you're facing
[42:34] tonight and if he would test our savior
[42:36] and our lord like that
[42:37] how dare we think that we're going to
[42:39] get by without being tested
[42:41] devil the devil's going to come time
[42:43] after time
[42:44] thought after thought reasoning after
[42:46] reasoning trying
[42:47] to get us to doubt who we are why we're
[42:50] here
[42:50] amen why why why we're here in the first
[42:53] place but
[42:54] he stood the test
[42:57] hallelujah and when he stood the test
[43:00] death
[43:00] itself everything under it he conquered
[43:03] it
[43:05] hallelujah so therefore amen that
[43:07] enemies against you is a conquered enemy
[43:11] hallelujah we're in the last days
[43:14] it's the last hours of days and we're
[43:18] seeing him now in his word
[43:20] and all of his word is being made
[43:22] manifest
[43:23] right here before us we're seeing amen
[43:26] prophecies that laid for
[43:28] thousands of generations are being
[43:30] fulfilled very rapidly right here before
[43:32] us
[43:33] amen as he would say as it were in the
[43:35] days of sodom or as it was in the
[43:37] in the days of noah we're seeing it
[43:39] fulfilled right here before us
[43:41] very quickly and very rapidly but he
[43:44] says old church of the living god
[43:46] amen get to your feet
[43:50] amen here there's a place that you can
[43:52] stand we did talk
[43:53] we've been talking about the place the
[43:54] devil can stand but there's a place here
[43:56] to stand
[43:57] and that's on the word of god get to
[43:59] your feet believe in him with all that's
[44:01] in you
[44:01] hold to that little wheel in the middle
[44:03] of the wheel let it
[44:05] stabilize every move let it stabilize
[44:08] every moses
[44:09] motive let it stabilize every motion let
[44:12] it stabilize
[44:12] every thought hallelujah
[44:16] there is something here that can
[44:17] stabilize your thinking
[44:19] there's something here that can
[44:20] stabilize your thoughts he said what is
[44:23] it
[44:23] may every motive every move every
[44:27] thought
[44:27] be controlled by this tower that's on
[44:30] the inside of you
[44:34] hallelujah but reading about blind
[44:36] bartimaeus
[44:38] could you imagine i i i try to today
[44:42] you know just somehow times lord knows i
[44:44] don't ever want to be
[44:45] go through what a blind person goes
[44:47] through
[44:48] there's a lot of other things i would
[44:50] pick before being blind
[44:52] but could you imagine the mind battles
[44:54] of a blind person
[44:57] you can see what's ahead of you you can
[44:59] see around you you can walk and you can
[45:01] be walking and you can
[45:02] you can hit this and he's oh that's just
[45:04] a speaker but i mean what what is a
[45:06] blind what's in the imagination of a
[45:08] blind person
[45:10] and here this man no doubt set day after
[45:12] day after day
[45:14] with with reasonings and imaginations
[45:16] and
[45:17] and and there's problems that were real
[45:19] problems
[45:20] greater problems than any of us probably
[45:22] has ever faced
[45:23] because i don't know as far as i know
[45:25] ain't nobody in here ever been blind
[45:27] but i mean here here i know this man had
[45:30] all kinds of things and
[45:31] and he's sitting there and dwelling upon
[45:34] them and thinking about them and
[45:35] wondering brother branham would
[45:37] go dramatize in many different places he
[45:39] said wondering how he's going to get his
[45:41] next meal and
[45:42] wondering how he's going to provide for
[45:44] his family he said history would tell us
[45:46] he was a married man but he was had to
[45:47] be he had to beg
[45:49] and he had a family to provide for and
[45:51] could you imagine the
[45:52] the emotional drain every day this man
[45:55] went through
[45:56] and the problems that he had to deal
[45:58] with that we don't ever have to deal
[45:59] with and we think we got a bad day
[46:02] the problems of just going from point a
[46:04] to point b
[46:08] the problems from just getting up out of
[46:09] a pew and going out there to the
[46:11] restroom or
[46:12] going to get a drink of water amen your
[46:14] great problems
[46:16] and his mind and the battles that he had
[46:18] to go through
[46:19] and he said i could see old blind
[46:21] bartimaeus sitting there
[46:22] this he said just just imagine we can
[46:25] see him and can
[46:26] catch what he was thinking about
[46:29] he said i imagine he was sitting there
[46:31] shivering
[46:33] winds were blowing his ragged sleeves
[46:35] hanging down
[46:36] if he could be operated on him for his
[46:38] blindness he wouldn't have the money to
[46:40] do it anyhow
[46:42] he had no hopes perhaps he couldn't do
[46:45] nothing for him if they
[46:46] if he did have the money here he sat
[46:48] there shivering
[46:49] in his thoughts
[46:52] and i'd imagine him being a believer he
[46:55] would think you know
[46:56] think back you know what i'm sitting
[46:57] right here by the wall
[46:59] right out about a hundred year yards
[47:00] from him was the very same highway that
[47:02] the great warrior joshua would march
[47:04] down through
[47:05] amen and move toward the gates and right
[47:08] out there beyond that was
[47:09] where the captain the host of the lord
[47:11] stood with his sword drawn
[47:13] and the same jericho where this blind
[47:15] man said i can imagine
[47:17] bartimaeus saying oh if i could only
[47:20] been living then if i could
[47:24] only bend there
[47:27] then i would be healed this is his
[47:30] thinking this is mine
[47:32] if i could be there
[47:36] if i could be in a different church
[47:38] service or
[47:39] if i could have been at that place i
[47:40] know how to receive what's wrong with
[47:42] tonight
[47:45] amen if i could have just been there
[47:48] when jehovah was really doing the
[47:50] miraculous
[47:51] but i mean the priest is telling me
[47:52] those days are gone now and
[47:54] and the hundreds of years ago he used to
[47:57] do them but he don't do them no more
[48:00] and then it was the same road that
[48:01] elijah and elijah would walk down
[48:03] with their arms around each other to the
[48:06] jordan where they struck the water
[48:08] and then the water parted and and they
[48:10] walked across on dry land
[48:12] and i can my imagine blind bartimaeus
[48:14] thinking
[48:15] oh if i could only lived in the day when
[48:18] the great mighty prophet
[48:20] walked down that aisle
[48:24] if i could just been in brother
[48:25] branham's meetings
[48:28] if i could have just been there then or
[48:30] in some great atmosphere then i could
[48:32] receive my healing these were the
[48:34] thoughts in this man's mind
[48:37] if i could have been there the prophet
[48:39] of god would have had mercy on me and
[48:41] would have given me back my sight but
[48:43] now the priests are saying the days of
[48:45] miracles are passing
[48:46] we don't have those kind of services no
[48:48] more and
[48:49] and it seems like jehovah's lost all of
[48:51] his strength
[48:52] this was his thinking but this was the
[48:56] day
[48:57] his thinking was about to be changed
[49:00] amen from a historical god of what he
[49:03] could have had
[49:04] and what could have been to a god of
[49:06] right now
[49:07] that'll meet my needs right now
[49:10] and this is where you get into battle
[49:12] when you come to the house of god
[49:14] or it might be another service and the
[49:15] devil's always trying to pound that into
[49:18] you
[49:18] next service next service next service
[49:21] or if i could have been back there
[49:23] or if we could just have another service
[49:24] like that what about this time
[49:28] amen this is the same building cancer
[49:30] was healed in
[49:32] this is the same building that alopecia
[49:34] would be wiped away
[49:35] this is the same building amen god would
[49:38] come down
[49:39] and heal a woman of a brain bleed this
[49:41] is the same place
[49:43] is not the place even greater than that
[49:46] then we serve the same
[49:48] god and he's not a god of history
[49:51] he's a god of today but we've got to
[49:54] change our thinking to say god
[49:56] you're right here right now even now to
[49:58] meet my need
[50:02] hallelujah i can imagine him saying
[50:05] these things and thinking on this
[50:07] maybe jehovah's lost all of his strength
[50:11] ain't that what the devil wants to make
[50:12] you think today god just you know he
[50:14] done some great things back in the 50s
[50:16] and 40s and 60s
[50:18] but where's he at today he's lost his
[50:21] strength
[50:21] you know he's not lost his strength you
[50:24] need to change your thinking
[50:26] amen he's really he's you know
[50:30] but he's he's still jehovah god he still
[50:33] has the same power
[50:34] he still has the same compassion he
[50:36] always has and he always will be
[50:39] they had them at that day who denied his
[50:41] power denied his miracles denied his
[50:43] signs
[50:44] and we got them today we got them that
[50:47] will preach you right into a tribulation
[50:51] preaching message material preach you
[50:53] right into a tribulation
[50:55] amen we got them in those days here but
[50:57] they still
[50:58] you know have those that are you know
[50:59] well we got to go through this and we
[51:01] got to do that and we got to be this and
[51:02] we got to go
[51:03] we got to go through trials and our
[51:05] tribulations we
[51:06] we how dare you think you're going to
[51:09] get by on a flower to bed
[51:10] who said we are
[51:19] but he said we also got them in those
[51:21] days who still believed
[51:26] we got them today that believes
[51:31] hello somebody and if there'll be a
[51:34] tomorrow
[51:35] they'll still be believing and they'll
[51:38] still be receiving
[51:40] amen jesus said i'm with you till the
[51:42] end of the world
[51:43] i'll be with you i'll walk by your side
[51:45] as a companion a fellow citizen i'll
[51:47] walk with you i'll guide you on the
[51:48] passage of go
[51:50] if you just let me oh he said i love
[51:52] that i'll be with you to the end of the
[51:54] world till it's
[51:55] all over i will be there
[51:58] then he thought oh if i could only lived
[52:01] in the days when miracles were real
[52:05] here i'm beyond the doctor's reach i'm a
[52:08] poor beggar
[52:09] i have a family at home maybe today i'll
[52:12] never even get a coin from my begging my
[52:14] family my children to go hungry
[52:16] my wife she's already she's already
[52:18] given all she can to the children
[52:20] i have no other way of making a living
[52:22] if i could only see if i could
[52:24] i could give me a job over somewhere but
[52:26] i can't see
[52:30] but as he sits there god begins to deal
[52:33] with his heart
[52:36] to prepare him for his healing because
[52:39] if his thinking didn't change he would
[52:40] have never received his healing
[52:43] come on now it'll pass right by him and
[52:46] been on the cross hanging there
[52:50] amen but here comes his opportunity but
[52:52] god always gives a person an opportunity
[52:55] god always gives a time amen a place or
[52:58] somebody can come to
[52:59] to get their thinking changed amen he
[53:02] said he began to deal with his heart
[53:04] and prepare him for something oh
[53:07] hallelujah
[53:08] have you ever had those times you're
[53:09] driving to church and all of a sudden
[53:11] your thinking changes
[53:12] and you're beginning to realize
[53:13] something's about to take place tonight
[53:15] what is it god is changing some thinking
[53:17] and thoughts and saying hey we ain't got
[53:19] to wait for another service
[53:20] tonight we can have that kind of night
[53:22] tonight we can have the supernatural
[53:24] among us
[53:25] tonight we can have jesus christ walk in
[53:27] the building and raise the dead
[53:29] make the ones in the wheelchair get out
[53:32] tonight we can have the ones amen
[53:34] there's having breathing problems all of
[53:35] a sudden
[53:36] a deep breath come to them tonight we
[53:39] can have
[53:40] jesus come and touch the blind among us
[53:44] hallelujah and open our eyes to realize
[53:46] what day we're living in
[53:47] [Music]

[53:55] he said it's when you begin to think
[53:57] about
[53:57] divine healing how many come to church
[54:01] tonight thinking about divine healing
[54:04] oh come on now how many come to church
[54:06] thinking about god

[54:14] get your thinking
[54:15] on christ about christ keep
[54:18] him on your mind
[54:23] if there be any praise if there be any
[54:25] virtue if there be any good thing

[54:29] comes by well maybe yeah
[54:31] maybe somehow kick it out
[54:34] get your mind right back think on things
[54:37] that's
[54:38] positive hello somebody
[54:42] he said never let a negative thought

[54:47] wheelchair you're hopeless or helpless
[54:51] come on now i don't even see anybody

[55:00] there's nobody
[55:01] in this building that's hopeless or
[55:04] helpless

[55:08] could fall in our prayer in our midst
[55:10] and change everything so you're not
[55:13] hopeless
[55:14] you're not helpless that's the devil
[55:16] lying to you
[55:21] don't let that negative thought come and
[55:24] get an anchor
[55:25] sometimes you can't help it from coming
[55:27] into your mind but don't let it stop
[55:28] there
[55:33] you know i'm amazed by people that have
[55:37] severe handicaps
[55:39] and you can see they have a strong mind
[55:42] because they don't let their handicaps
[55:44] get to them
[55:45] i mean you see people that don't i was
[55:47] just actually today
[55:49] was watching this video on a farmer and
[55:51] he's doing all of his
[55:52] row cropping and things it was just
[55:54] interesting watching him how he operated
[55:55] this
[55:55] crazy high dollar equipment so as i said
[55:59] he's got a podcast and stuff so i just
[56:00] happened to see it and watching it
[56:02] and he began to say he said you know he
[56:04] said i i i i got to give a shout out to
[56:07] so and so don't remember his name
[56:08] he said because he's a man who farms he
[56:11] said he runs tractors
[56:12] he does all kinds of things plants corn
[56:14] grows corn i don't remember all the
[56:16] stuff he does
[56:17] with no arms
[56:20] he said so i don't have any problems
[56:22] today
[56:26] well if you get your thinking right
[56:28] tonight you realize i don't have any
[56:29] problems
[56:31] because god's already took care of it
[56:33] [Music]
[56:34] hallelujah amen what happens though he
[56:38] said a bird can come over and start
[56:39] flying over your place
[56:40] but you don't have to let him make a
[56:42] nest you get a double barrel shotgun and
[56:44] shoot him out of his roosting spot
[56:47] it's time some of you break out your
[56:49] weapon tonight i mean the devil's been
[56:51] taking
[56:52] place and he's got a big old nest you
[56:54] ever seen a barn swallow
[56:55] a barn swallow make the nastiest mess
[56:57] you've ever seen on the side of your
[56:59] house
[56:59] it'll bring mud and mud and mud and
[57:02] cakes and mud
[57:03] and and all of a sudden mud's going down
[57:05] your house and underneath there's
[57:06] nothing but bird mess
[57:07] everywhere that's what the devil's got
[57:10] in some of your people's brains
[57:13] amen we've got people so cobwebbed up to
[57:16] where they can't believe in divine
[57:17] healing
[57:18] they can't believe it and the holy ghost
[57:20] is for them they can't believe that
[57:21] god's the same yesterday today and
[57:23] forever
[57:24] they can't believe why because they've
[57:25] allowed their thinking to be
[57:27] changed
[57:30] amen they can't believe in altar calls
[57:32] no more
[57:34] prayer lines are out why because they
[57:36] got a lot of cobwebs up there
[57:38] a lot of birdness has taken place and
[57:40] they've aligned all kinds of things to
[57:42] support their thinking
[57:47] come too late to tell me a prayer line
[57:49] don't work
[57:51] a couple wednesday nights ago we had a
[57:52] preaching prayer line
[57:54] some people might think that was out of
[57:56] order but apparently god didn't think so
[57:59] because all i know a woman with a brain
[58:01] bleed it has changed her to where she's
[58:03] now
[58:04] moving forward and got some fight in her
[58:06] living life
[58:08] hallelujah all i know is it took a
[58:10] little boy that had thyroid issues and
[58:12] now the doctors for the first time in
[58:14] three years
[58:14] says that his levels are going back to
[58:16] normal and they're going to cut it and
[58:18] cut his medicine in half
[58:19] expect them to be off of it the next few
[58:21] little bits
[58:22] come on people this is god moving on to
[58:25] sage
[58:27] so how dare you come and tell somebody
[58:30] prayer lines don't work no more
[58:33] when god wants to hold a prayer line
[58:35] it'll shut the critic's mouth
[58:43] hallelujah you can't help them from
[58:45] coming by but you don't have to let them
[58:48] roost
[58:50] them well what i got got a double belt
[58:52] shotgun
[58:53] old new testament it's got enough
[58:55] ammunition there to blow the devil and
[58:56] everything he's got
[58:59] hallelujah we keep saying the devil
[59:01] ain't got enough he don't have enough
[59:03] but god's got enough
[59:08] amen he's got a bullet for every enemy
[59:10] he's got enough to
[59:11] drive every devil he's going to back
[59:14] into the lake of fire
[59:15] to their destruction forever amen god's
[59:18] got enough
[59:19] but blind bartimaeus sitting there with
[59:20] all this passing through his mind
[59:24] passing through his mind if i could only
[59:26] bend whether great prophets were if i
[59:29] if i could just have them stop for a
[59:31] moment and talk
[59:32] i believe jehovah would give me my sight
[59:34] but all of a sudden
[59:36] he heard a noise all of a sudden you
[59:39] know
[59:39] you know it's amazing people scare the
[59:41] noise but brother branham over and over
[59:42] and over said when jesus comes
[59:44] there's always noise and it said the
[59:46] noise started taking place
[59:48] people began to scream and shout so i'm
[59:50] waiting all screaming praises and
[59:52] shouting some were screaming
[59:53] away with him he's like he's a crazy man
[59:56] he's bials above
[59:57] but there was others screaming hosanna
[1:00:00] hosanna blessed be the rock
[1:00:02] hallelujah there were things taking
[1:00:04] place and all of a sudden blimey
[1:00:06] martinez said who is that
[1:00:09] who's coming to the place who's coming
[1:00:10] down the street and he said maybe it was
[1:00:12] some little nice woman sitting by him
[1:00:14] and said hey
[1:00:15] that's jesus from nazareth he's the one
[1:00:17] who raised the dead
[1:00:19] he's the one who gave the leper back his
[1:00:21] pure skin he's the one who'd done this
[1:00:23] and he began to realize hey this ain't a
[1:00:25] god of history no more
[1:00:27] this is the god of right now
[1:00:30] hallelujah and he began to scream out
[1:00:33] jesus
[1:00:34] thou son of david have mercy upon me
[1:00:39] amen just a few moments ago he was
[1:00:41] thinking god was a god of history but
[1:00:43] all of a sudden he's screaming out
[1:00:45] jesus have mercy on me
[1:00:48] hallelujah is there anyone here tonight
[1:00:50] and say god
[1:00:51] change my thinking change my thoughts
[1:00:55] to when i come into a service i'm
[1:00:57] screaming out
[1:00:58] jesus have mercy on me
[1:01:02] touch my heart touch my life help my
[1:01:05] family god
[1:01:08] why is it sometimes we sit around like
[1:01:10] we don't have any needs
[1:01:14] we go through service after service like
[1:01:16] we don't have an old needs and let me
[1:01:17] watch
[1:01:18] family's falling apart and things are
[1:01:21] taking place
[1:01:23] and we don't have nothing in us to
[1:01:24] realize he's here right now
[1:01:26] and just a little bit of a move it can
[1:01:29] change it all
[1:01:32] an action to cause a reaction i don't
[1:01:36] ever want to be guilty of sitting in a
[1:01:37] building letting jesus walk through and
[1:01:39] meeting every call in his name
[1:01:41] because i'm so obscured with other
[1:01:43] doubts and mind battles and things and
[1:01:45] other
[1:01:45] that i allowed him to walk right by and
[1:01:48] i never even mentioned him
[1:01:52] then we walked out didn't get nothing
[1:01:54] out of that one
[1:01:55] well whose fault was it
[1:01:59] come on now let's just be honest let's
[1:02:00] hit the road get the rubber on the road
[1:02:02] tonight
[1:02:03] i know we want to blame the song leader
[1:02:04] and blame the musicians and blame this
[1:02:06] and
[1:02:06] whose fault is it when we don't get
[1:02:08] nothing out of the service
[1:02:10] look in the mirror
[1:02:14] amen hallelujah let's just smile a while
[1:02:19] it's like that boy you know you heard
[1:02:21] the story watched his uncle reach in his
[1:02:23] pocket when the offering come by and he
[1:02:24] got a dime throated in it
[1:02:25] man didn't really like what the preacher
[1:02:27] said so when he walked out he reached
[1:02:28] over and got his dime put it back in his
[1:02:30] pocket and his boy looked at him
[1:02:32] he said what are you doing he said well
[1:02:34] i didn't like what the man said so i'm
[1:02:36] getting my dime back he said hey
[1:02:37] little boy said hey you know if you put
[1:02:39] more in you'd have got more out
[1:02:46] hello somebody think about the woman who
[1:02:49] watched jesus feet she put all she had
[1:02:51] in
[1:02:52] you know about mind battles amen what
[1:02:55] kind of mind battles that woman was
[1:02:56] facing and she walked back to the house
[1:02:58] to go get all the money she had
[1:03:00] not knowing if he was going to reject
[1:03:01] her or turn her down or call her a
[1:03:03] or whatever but she was willing to lay
[1:03:05] it all on the line
[1:03:06] [Applause]
[1:03:08] hallelujah i heard a wonderful message
[1:03:10] of hold the line but i think we ought to
[1:03:11] hear it
[1:03:12] lay it all on the line say god here it
[1:03:15] is i'm giving it all to you
[1:03:16] i'm laying myself out before you i want
[1:03:19] everything to be holy and righteous
[1:03:21] and if you find anything there i want to
[1:03:23] go
[1:03:29] some were screaming away with him
[1:03:31] confusions
[1:03:32] away with him others were saying hosanna
[1:03:35] hosanna
[1:03:39] but here came along the very captain
[1:03:42] joshua met
[1:03:45] hallelujah the very pillar of fire that
[1:03:48] led to children of
[1:03:49] israel here he was again
[1:03:53] and people were screaming while he stood
[1:03:55] there days of miracles are passed
[1:03:57] all hopes are gone and here comes the
[1:03:59] captain of the host of the lord
[1:04:00] walking by just on time
[1:04:04] he always arrives just right and here he
[1:04:07] come by i called
[1:04:08] of course a blind man he didn't know i
[1:04:10] could imagine him listening his head
[1:04:11] turned around
[1:04:12] somebody began to tell him that there is
[1:04:15] jesus
[1:04:16] and something began to rise up he said
[1:04:18] what happened after
[1:04:19] after all the things began to change a
[1:04:22] new hope rose up
[1:04:24] amen i knew hope rose up here he was
[1:04:27] beginning to hear
[1:04:28] the word faith comes by hearing amen
[1:04:31] somebody told him that's jesus the
[1:04:33] prophet
[1:04:34] who's here healing the sick well it must
[1:04:36] be
[1:04:37] jesus walking right here amen what could
[1:04:40] stop him nothing could stop him but a
[1:04:42] scream
[1:04:42] jesus
[1:04:50] his faith stopped jesus in his tracks
[1:04:55] what can your faith do
[1:05:01] he says the lord looked at him and said
[1:05:04] what do you want
[1:05:06] well you'd think that would be obvious
[1:05:08] what do you want
[1:05:10] he said i might receive my sight
[1:05:13] he says thy faith healed you he said i
[1:05:16] can see that as he turns around
[1:05:18] on up the road oh blind bartimaeus
[1:05:20] standing there he told me when i was
[1:05:22] healed
[1:05:24] and then i can see him looking at his
[1:05:26] hand
[1:05:27] and someone trying to say see
[1:05:30] you still can't see it
[1:05:34] but he told me
[1:05:37] went back to the word he told me
[1:05:42] see you still ain't seen a rapture but
[1:05:45] he told me
[1:05:47] see you still ain't seen a body change
[1:05:50] but he told me
[1:05:51] see you still ain't received your
[1:05:53] healing but he told me
[1:05:56] go back to the word but he told me
[1:06:00] that i could be saved he told me that i
[1:06:03] could be
[1:06:04] healed he told me i could be delivered
[1:06:06] he
[1:06:07] told me and right in the middle of all
[1:06:11] their doubts
[1:06:12] his eyes come open why because he
[1:06:15] refused
[1:06:16] to believe what they were saying and
[1:06:18] only believe what jesus said
[1:06:28] he said a man who probably couldn't even
[1:06:30] sign his own name
[1:06:32] if his faith could stop jesus of
[1:06:35] nazareth
[1:06:36] and a multitude of people crying for his
[1:06:38] blood
[1:06:39] with a burden on his heart his eyes
[1:06:41] toward calvary
[1:06:43] how much more can your faith stop him
[1:06:45] tonight
[1:06:46] and bring him to your individual need
[1:06:52] but you know it's when you begin to
[1:06:53] think about god
[1:06:55] when you keep him on your mind you know
[1:06:58] we sit in church
[1:07:00] and we think about everything else but
[1:07:02] god
[1:07:04] all right let's just have an honest
[1:07:05] service tonight how we're going to do
[1:07:07] how much washing we got to do how much
[1:07:10] we got to do at the office tomorrow
[1:07:12] how are we going to do this or how we're
[1:07:13] going to do that
[1:07:15] keep your mind off of that and keep it
[1:07:18] on god
[1:07:23] the bible says if there be any praise if
[1:07:25] there be any virtue think on these
[1:07:27] things
[1:07:28] well you know you begin to he said
[1:07:30] people begin to think well i wonder
[1:07:31] i wonder if i'll be called in a prayer
[1:07:33] line i wonder if god will speak
[1:07:36] don't think that kind of negative
[1:07:39] thought
[1:07:41] don't let don't let it go through your
[1:07:43] mind make every word positive and ever
[1:07:45] thought positive
[1:07:46] as the disciples on the road amen to
[1:07:49] amaze me as cleopas
[1:07:51] at what was it they began talking about
[1:07:53] jesus they began thinking about jesus
[1:07:56] and when they begin talking and thinking
[1:07:58] about him he steps out of the bushes
[1:08:01] hallelujah while they were thinking on
[1:08:03] him while they were meditating on
[1:08:05] that's the same way jesus does today
[1:08:08] and we wonder why we ain't seen him
[1:08:10] sometimes it might be because we ain't
[1:08:12] thinking about him or talking about it
[1:08:14] or meditating on him come on now
[1:08:18] amen he said see in my heart in my mind
[1:08:21] all day long let me walk with the lord
[1:08:24] in the light of his word with the
[1:08:25] heavenly dove
[1:08:26] let me have fellowship with him all
[1:08:29] day long
[1:08:35] but if you have so many other things on
[1:08:37] your mind
[1:08:39] it's another quote sometimes we'll come
[1:08:42] to church
[1:08:43] thinking about it tomorrow i got to do
[1:08:46] this
[1:08:47] the next day i've got to do that and
[1:08:49] when we come to church
[1:08:51] we ought to lay aside every thought and
[1:08:54] everything of the world
[1:08:56] and enter into fellowship with christ in
[1:08:58] worship
[1:09:01] meditating worshiping in our hearts
[1:09:04] giving songs and praises to him
[1:09:06] thinking of his goodness and what he
[1:09:08] means to us worshiping in the spirit
[1:09:11] singing spiritual songs making melodies
[1:09:13] in our heart
[1:09:14] even the bible said if there is there's
[1:09:16] any afflicted let them sing songs be
[1:09:18] happy
[1:09:19] be in meditation always expecting god
[1:09:23] at any moment to appear to you
[1:09:27] my goodness that changed a lot of days
[1:09:30] in our lives wouldn't it
[1:09:34] if you're always expecting god at any
[1:09:36] moment to appear to you
[1:09:45] he would say in another place he said
[1:09:46] while i'm praying and speaking
[1:09:49] he said i want every person in here to
[1:09:51] have this on your mind
[1:09:53] as soon as prayer begins to go for the
[1:09:55] sick
[1:09:57] every one of you is going to get up and
[1:09:58] walk out of the building
[1:10:01] well
[1:10:04] that was two different thoughts right
[1:10:06] there wouldn't it
[1:10:08] have this on you might do that on
[1:10:10] purpose have this on your mind as soon
[1:10:12] as prayer begins to go for the sick
[1:10:15] every one of you is going to get up and
[1:10:17] walk out of the building
[1:10:19] well
[1:10:22] man i think we ought to expect that why
[1:10:25] not
[1:10:27] amen why not why not me why not now
[1:10:30] amen why not don't have anything else on
[1:10:33] your mind
[1:10:34] keep thinking that i'm going to get up
[1:10:37] and walk out of here well
[1:10:39] you can't get anything from god with a
[1:10:41] negative thought he that cometh to god
[1:10:44] must believe that he is
[1:10:45] and a rewarder of those that diligently
[1:10:48] seek him
[1:10:55] lebron would talk about the slaves and
[1:10:57] how man was bought as a slave ended up
[1:10:59] being a king son
[1:11:00] remember the story talking about mind
[1:11:02] battles
[1:11:03] going from being a king son to a slave
[1:11:09] here he was offered a man bought him
[1:11:12] took him to his place
[1:11:14] one day a broker come by and he saw a
[1:11:16] bunch of slaves working
[1:11:17] on a certain plantation a hundred more
[1:11:19] slaves
[1:11:22] and they were sad their minds were
[1:11:28] tore up negative thoughts
[1:11:31] they thought they would never go home
[1:11:33] again
[1:11:34] they thought about babies they would
[1:11:36] never see papa and mama they'd never see
[1:11:39] a relationship the relations that they
[1:11:40] would never see
[1:11:42] they were very downcast as it is so
[1:11:45] easily to become
[1:11:49] it's a lot easier to get downcast than
[1:11:51] it is to get happy
[1:11:53] especially in the world that we living
[1:11:54] in there's a lot more in this world to
[1:11:57] be down about than there is to be happy
[1:11:58] about as far as the world's concerned
[1:12:01] because there's no hope in this world
[1:12:02] there's nothing that you can pull
[1:12:04] happiness from
[1:12:05] he said that's what the devil likes to
[1:12:07] work on you and oppress you
[1:12:09] you know that's the trick of the devil
[1:12:10] to oppress but when this christian knows
[1:12:13] his legal rights
[1:12:14] when you can quote god's word
[1:12:17] it says i'll never leave thee or forsake

[1:13:46] things you're thinking about them

[1:14:04] his chest stuck out and his chin up
[1:14:07] just willing to work do anything a
[1:14:09] snappy brilliant fella

[1:14:36] he's the son of a king though he's a
[1:14:39] slave

[1:14:48] and throw up our heads yes you're sons
[1:14:51] and daughters of a king
[1:14:53] not a king the king
[1:14:56] what kind of person are we to be he did
[1:14:59] that to keep the morale of the rest of
[1:15:00] them up
[1:15:01] and he said that's what we got to do
[1:15:03] who's born again of the holy spirit
[1:15:05] keep up a good courage
[1:15:09] hallelujah what kind of people should we
[1:15:11] be knowing that our heavenly father
[1:15:13] is the king and only one thing the slave
[1:15:16] never knew
[1:15:17] he never knew if he'd be back home again
[1:15:19] but there's one thing we know
[1:15:20] we're going home again jesus said i'll
[1:15:23] come
[1:15:24] and receive you myself and where i am
[1:15:26] there you may be also
[1:15:28] don't let your heart be troubled don't
[1:15:30] think about anything else

[1:15:35] he said brother that'll make a
[1:15:36] mockingbird sing in the night
[1:15:39] amen if i don't make a mockingbird sing
[1:15:41] in the middle of the night what ought to
[1:15:43] be to a son or a daughter of god
[1:15:45] who knows this ain't my home i'm just
[1:15:47] passing through
[1:15:48] i got a place i'm going to had a lawyer
[1:15:52] i am a son of a king i am a daughter of
[1:15:55] the king
[1:15:56] [Applause]
[1:16:02] mary went walking down the street
[1:16:08] as she walked down the little dirt path
[1:16:10] for a sidewalk
[1:16:12] all of a sudden she began to realize
[1:16:14] there's something around her
[1:16:16] a real strange feeling he said that's
[1:16:19] the most wonderful experience
[1:16:22] he said i trust everybody here has that
[1:16:24] kind of experience sometime
[1:16:26] i say yes lord if you haven't
[1:16:30] this would be a wonderful night to start
[1:16:35] woo glory to god amen
[1:16:38] just how do i start brother timothy how
[1:16:40] do i start just
[1:16:41] start thinking about him
[1:16:49] so simple and worship him in your heart
[1:16:53] and all of a sudden you'll feel the
[1:16:55] closeness of the holy spirit around you
[1:16:58] and it gets so anointed to you can't
[1:17:00] hold it any longer
[1:17:01] and all of a sudden your hands are shoot
[1:17:03] up or something to happen you can't
[1:17:05] stand still
[1:17:06] when that comes
[1:17:09] she was thinking not noticing what was
[1:17:12] around her
[1:17:13] little lady perhaps with a pair of
[1:17:14] sandals on their feet walking down a
[1:17:16] little dusty path
[1:17:17] but thinking of the lord and his
[1:17:20] promises
[1:17:21] of things to come she was thinking
[1:17:25] and all of a sudden the feeling got so
[1:17:27] great around her until she raised up her
[1:17:28] head
[1:17:30] she just raised up her head and they're
[1:17:33] standing before her was a light
[1:17:36] and that of that light steps gabriel the
[1:17:38] angel the archangel of god
[1:17:40] he says if you want angels to appear to
[1:17:42] you
[1:17:44] listen if you want angels to appear to
[1:17:46] you
[1:17:47] keep your mind on god and off
[1:17:50] the things of the world
[1:17:56] go about your business go to church go
[1:17:59] to your washing
[1:18:00] whatever but keep your mind on him all
[1:18:03] day
[1:18:04] and all night then god will do something
[1:18:07] you're drawing close to him you're the
[1:18:09] world is being shut out
[1:18:11] just you and him together
[1:18:15] mercy
[1:18:18] the appearance of the angel no doubt
[1:18:20] frightened the little virgin
[1:18:21] she had been taught in those days that
[1:18:23] made that days of miracles were passed
[1:18:25] but she had seen something happen the
[1:18:27] angel said hell mary
[1:18:28] hill means to stop he had a message for
[1:18:31] her
[1:18:32] and when the angel comes he's got a
[1:18:34] message
[1:18:36] when the holy spirit comes amen god's
[1:18:39] angel is here tonight with the message
[1:18:41] for every believer
[1:18:42] keep your mind on him keep
[1:18:45] thinking about him think about how
[1:18:48] lovely
[1:18:48] he is how sweet he is think about his
[1:18:52] promises
[1:18:52] if you're sick get that off your mind if
[1:18:55] you're sick get this on your mind
[1:18:57] he was wounded for my transgressions he
[1:18:59] was bruised for my iniquity
[1:19:01] the chastisement of my peace were upon
[1:19:03] him and with his stripes
[1:19:05] i was healed keep your mind centered
[1:19:08] like that
[1:19:08] and something will start happening
[1:19:12] all of a sudden there's something drawn
[1:19:14] out of you and anointed will come and
[1:19:16] out of the chair you'll go
[1:19:17] drawn out of the lord and he'll draw
[1:19:19] nigh to you
[1:19:21] but it's usually when you've got your
[1:19:23] mind on him
[1:19:26] it's reasonably usually at times when
[1:19:28] you're thinking about him when he
[1:19:29] appears
[1:19:30] you know when you're thinking about
[1:19:32] getting right or doing something right
[1:19:33] that's when he comes to help you it must
[1:19:36] have been about that time
[1:19:40] supernatural started taking place
[1:19:43] this is one of my favorite quotes and
[1:19:45] looking to the unseen yes
[1:19:50] that i think he said i think the holy
[1:19:51] spirit
[1:19:53] can lead a man and tell him things and
[1:19:55] make him act different and make him
[1:19:56] believe things and receive things
[1:19:58] that this world could never believe can
[1:20:00] happen
[1:20:02] that's the difference the holy spirit
[1:20:04] i'm a witness
[1:20:06] he said i was a blind man once myself
[1:20:08] practically had to be led
[1:20:09] so i now know what i'm talking about
[1:20:11] that is the holy spirit
[1:20:13] he said oh can't you feel that pulsation
[1:20:15] of the spirit
[1:20:16] begin to rise on your heart saying jesus
[1:20:18] christ
[1:20:19] is in our midst oh can we turn our
[1:20:22] thoughts to this for a moment jesus
[1:20:24] christ is in our midst
[1:20:26] how do you know wherever two or three
[1:20:28] are gathering my name there i'll be
[1:20:32] pulsation something begins moving like a
[1:20:34] heartbeat
[1:20:35] it's pumping energy into your spirit
[1:20:37] it's pumping energy into your mind
[1:20:39] then let the things your eyes just black
[1:20:41] out
[1:20:42] and see not the things of the world see
[1:20:45] the things of god
[1:20:47] see what god's doing see like noah he
[1:20:50] just let it all black out
[1:20:52] all the critics all the naysayers
[1:20:55] all the people walking away just let it
[1:20:57] black out
[1:21:00] don't listen to him don't give a dime of
[1:21:03] your time to a critic
[1:21:06] give it all to jesus
[1:21:11] if noah would have gave a dime a time
[1:21:13] diamond timer to the critics he had
[1:21:16] he'd have never built the ark
[1:21:20] but he kept one nail after another nail
[1:21:22] board after another board
[1:21:23] jesus said god said it's going to rain
[1:21:27] children this is not a dream this is a
[1:21:30] visitation
[1:21:30] it's going to rain it's going to rain
[1:21:34] these little chihuahuas believe the sign
[1:21:38] not a dime let them go
[1:21:43] let them go on there might finally be
[1:21:45] made manifest
[1:21:47] but there's still a people that's saying
[1:21:48] no my eyes are on jesus
[1:21:53] we see where it led them to anyhow
[1:21:56] oh i'm walking away from a cult and then
[1:21:58] they walk away from god altogether
[1:22:03] not a dime of time i don't know why i'm
[1:22:05] saying that over and over maybe somebody
[1:22:06] had been trying to listen to quit
[1:22:08] listening to them
[1:22:10] let it go
[1:22:13] it ain't worth it
[1:22:17] they can't offer you anything better
[1:22:24] yeah or even as good anything in
[1:22:27] comparison
[1:22:33] he says believing what god
[1:22:36] said he said oh tonight in this and
[1:22:40] angelus uh temple could so tune our
[1:22:43] hearts
[1:22:45] not our literal minds let it go cast
[1:22:47] down reason but with our hearts
[1:22:49] could tune into the word of god to see a
[1:22:53] revival break forth
[1:22:54] to see the altars full to see the church
[1:22:57] pact to see a revival spreading through
[1:22:59] los angeles a fire that cannot be put
[1:23:01] out our hearts would begin to pulsate
[1:23:04] under the power of the holy ghost
[1:23:05] there would be such a prayer meeting
[1:23:07] over los angeles night if it could
[1:23:08] happen
[1:23:08] certainly he said what in the when the
[1:23:11] church is in tune
[1:23:14] that's what happened in the upper room
[1:23:15] when they got an all one mind and one
[1:23:18] accord
[1:23:19] who's mine his mind not peter's not any
[1:23:22] other
[1:23:22] his mind he said when what if the people
[1:23:25] here tonight
[1:23:26] that sick could just begin to think this
[1:23:29] right here
[1:23:30] three words god is god
[1:23:38] well if he's god then cancer has to bow
[1:23:42] covet has to bow demons of every kind
[1:23:45] has to flee
[1:23:46] if god is god amen if he isn't
[1:23:50] why are we serving him hallelujah
[1:23:53] but if he's still god he's still a
[1:23:56] healer
[1:23:56] if he's still god he's still the
[1:23:58] deliverer if he's still
[1:23:59] god he's still the same yesterday today
[1:24:01] and forever if he's still
[1:24:03] god his word is still true and i say
[1:24:05] he's still god
[1:24:07] and god is god amen and he made a
[1:24:10] promise
[1:24:11] he won't break it if god is god he has
[1:24:13] to keep it and then all of a sudden
[1:24:15] a pulsation begins to rise in the heart
[1:24:18] something's going to take place
[1:24:19] nothing's going to stop this it's a fire
[1:24:22] as like a building on fire on a windy
[1:24:24] day
[1:24:24] it just keeps blowing as the holy spirit
[1:24:26] fans that fire
[1:24:27] and it keeps burning until it becomes a
[1:24:29] reality to you
[1:24:32] because why god is god
[1:24:36] apparently the world's thinking don't
[1:24:37] believe that
[1:24:39] they don't believe in a god
[1:24:44] christianity don't really believe in the
[1:24:46] god that we talk about
[1:24:47] because apparently their god has no
[1:24:49] power
[1:24:51] apparently their god has no power to
[1:24:53] cleanse them from smoking drinking
[1:24:55] adulteries every kind of filth in the
[1:24:58] world they can just come and be a
[1:24:59] christian but still live like a sinner
[1:25:02] that's all it is it's just changing a
[1:25:04] name
[1:25:05] not a nature we want a nature change
[1:25:09] but the god that i talk about still has
[1:25:11] the power
[1:25:12] the god that i'm speaking about still
[1:25:14] can raise the dead
[1:25:16] he can still heal the blind he can still
[1:25:19] save the lost
[1:25:20] hallelujah god is god let me read this
[1:25:24] last one here as we
[1:25:25] as we bring this down deny
[1:25:28] your thinking deny your mental
[1:25:31] conceptions
[1:25:33] just believe god's word and say it's
[1:25:36] true
[1:25:36] and march on with it keep moving
[1:25:40] you get sicker keep moving after a while
[1:25:43] you're going to break through every
[1:25:44] barrier
[1:25:46] and be free then you'll see him then
[1:25:48] he'll reveal himself to you
[1:25:50] that then the son of god who made the
[1:25:52] promise
[1:25:53] will be real if a man could ever
[1:25:56] catch the vision of the invisible god
[1:26:03] not not just to hope so not just a maybe
[1:26:07] so not just a god of yesterday
[1:26:10] oh remember what god did over here and
[1:26:12] that
[1:26:14] a god who's present always present
[1:26:18] there's something that stabilizes that
[1:26:20] man's thinking
[1:26:22] it stabilizes his actions and in the
[1:26:25] time of distress
[1:26:26] and trouble he'll still look upward
[1:26:30] above the things that are happening
[1:26:32] around him
[1:26:34] because why he caught a vision of the
[1:26:36] unseen
[1:26:38] oh how abraham the reason he believed it
[1:26:41] because god
[1:26:41] said it and god said it he was going to
[1:26:44] look at
[1:26:44] look at the promise no matter what took
[1:26:46] place and call it present tense and rest
[1:26:48] upon it
[1:26:50] where if you look at with your eyes and
[1:26:52] you see now our nation is shaken
[1:26:54] trembling war clouds are flying
[1:26:57] everywhere
[1:26:58] the stresses perplexities of time every
[1:27:01] sign that jesus said was happening
[1:27:03] it would happen it's happening there
[1:27:04] will be signs in the heaven and the
[1:27:06] earth all these things are taking place
[1:27:08] but he commanded his church to lift up
[1:27:11] their heads
[1:27:13] change your thinking
[1:27:16] in that day to look up for the unseen
[1:27:19] christ were to be appearing pretty soon
[1:27:21] so if we would walk by sight we'd be
[1:27:24] children of darkness sure enough now
[1:27:26] but i'm so glad to know that there's a
[1:27:27] light that shines in every believer's
[1:27:30] heart
[1:27:31] until the eternal day when jesus will
[1:27:33] return
[1:27:36] god change our thinking may we not ever
[1:27:39] sacrifice a service to our thoughts of
[1:27:44] tomorrow
[1:27:46] how many services have we sacrificed
[1:27:50] on thoughts of yesterday thoughts of
[1:27:52] tomorrow
[1:27:54] thoughts of what we got going on and
[1:27:56] what we're going through
[1:27:57] and we sacrifice that service god help
[1:28:00] us
[1:28:01] i believe we're in the time that we
[1:28:03] better be in tune
[1:28:05] because the supernatural is going to
[1:28:06] start happening so quick
[1:28:08] that if you're not watching for it
[1:28:09] you're going to miss it
[1:28:11] aspire heads
[1:28:15] just in those last few hours of christ
[1:28:18] hanging on the cross
[1:28:20] how many prophecies were fulfilled and
[1:28:22] they missed it
[1:28:28] god open our eyes
[1:28:31] change our thinking
[1:28:37] tune in
[1:28:40] when you come through these doors one
[1:28:42] thought god is god
[1:28:45] start worshipping him giving him glory
[1:28:48] giving him praise and honor in the
[1:28:52] position and place he deserves
[1:28:54] let him draw nigh to you
[1:28:59] i wonder how many would just say lord i
[1:29:01] i want that kind of experience
[1:29:04] i want to experience the holy spirit to
[1:29:06] just surround me and
[1:29:08] draw me into a place a place that may be
[1:29:11] beyond my comfort level but lord long as
[1:29:14] it's with you
