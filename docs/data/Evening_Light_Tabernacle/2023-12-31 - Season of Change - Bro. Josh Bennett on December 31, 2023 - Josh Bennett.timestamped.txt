[56:14] God
[56:18] hallelujah
[56:20] hallelujah you know I I was
[56:23] just I was just thinking the other day
[56:25] and has been preaching on out of the
[56:27] Book of John
[56:29] and then come over there in the John 19
[56:34] and Jesus is standing in Pilot's Hall
[56:38] and and everything that happened to him
[56:41] was for the purpose of
[56:44] humiliation they made a mockery out of
[56:46] him and put a crown of thorns on his
[56:49] head
[56:50] and a robe of of mockery and everything
[56:55] they done was to mock
[56:58] him and he never opened up he never
[57:01] opened his mouth brother brandham said
[57:04] that Satan looked at him and said this
[57:06] could not be the Son of God there just
[57:09] no way there's no way that this that
[57:11] this is the promised
[57:13] one how could he be the Son of God and
[57:16] and allow them to do all these things he
[57:19] said but what he didn't understand he
[57:20] said as a Son of God can go through
[57:23] anything as long as he knows he's in the
[57:25] will of
[57:28] God and Jesus stood there and he didn't
[57:31] even open his mouth and I thought all
[57:33] the humiliation and they looked and then
[57:35] they wouldn't they took him and nailed
[57:36] him on the cross and even the people
[57:38] that was around the cross said if you'll
[57:40] come down we'll believe you and we'll
[57:43] follow
[57:44] you see but I got to thinking about it
[57:47] that Thief even the the thief on the on
[57:50] the one side he said save us and save
[57:53] yourself
[57:55] we'll believe you save
[57:57] us but the other
[58:01] Thief I got to thinking about
[58:03] him and he saw Jesus in his most
[58:07] humiliated time in the most humiliated
[58:12] condition I thought about it I thought
[58:14] you know what his encounter with Christ
[58:17] was not when he was walking on the water
[58:19] that's right his encounter with Christ
[58:22] was not when he was opening up blinded
[58:23] eyes and and raising the dead and all
[58:26] the supernatural thing his encounter
[58:28] with Christ was when he was at in his
[58:30] most humiliated
[58:32] condition but yet there was something in
[58:34] his heart he looked at Jesus Christ in
[58:37] the most humilated condition that he
[58:38] could be be in and he still
[58:43] believed and I thought oh God that's me
[58:47] I'm the thief that was on The Cross by
[58:49] his side and I just want to say Lord
[58:51] remember me amen how many has that
[58:54] attitude this one just remember me
[58:57] Lord amen let's just bow our hearts

[1:02:55] for what profit hath he that worketh in
[1:02:58] that wherein he hath labor I have seen
[1:03:01] the travail which God hath given to the
[1:03:03] sons of men to be exercised in it and he
[1:03:07] hath made everything beautiful in his
[1:03:11] time and also he has set the world in
[1:03:13] their heart uh in their heart so that no
[1:03:16] man can find out the work that God
[1:03:19] maketh from the beginning to the end
[1:03:23] amen 2 Corinthians the third
[1:03:25] chapter just one verse there 2

[1:03:42] as in a glass the glory of the Lord are
[1:03:46] changed into the same image from glory
[1:03:50] to glory even as by the spirit
[1:03:55] of the Lord amen may God just add His
[1:03:57] blessings to the reading of the words as
[1:03:59] you're having your seats this morning
[1:04:02] I'd like to um speak for uh a few
[1:04:06] minutes this morning on a the season of
[1:04:09] change and um I believe that you know uh
[1:04:13] we're getting ready to change the
[1:04:15] calendar and so we've we've come to the
[1:04:17] end of another year and the uh the end
[1:04:20] of of of this year will just take us
[1:04:23] into the beginning of the next and and
[1:04:25] so um we see that you know we're we've
[1:04:29] come to another change or time of change
[1:04:31] and I was just thinking remembering back
[1:04:34] um in June we had our meeting there at
[1:04:36] the church and we were dedicating the
[1:04:38] church and brother Timothy had come and
[1:04:41] and uh was a part of those meetings and
[1:04:43] and um and he uh he spoke I don't
[1:04:46] remember what you titled exactly but was
[1:04:48] it the season of change so it's same
[1:04:50] title uh but he spoke on that and and uh
[1:04:54] it was just um it was really just the
[1:04:56] Lord it was Supernatural because uh what
[1:04:59] he didn't know was uh just a couple
[1:05:02] weeks before that I was sitting in my in
[1:05:05] my office there at the church and I had
[1:05:06] a calendar there and and uh I was
[1:05:09] marking the dates on the calendar for
[1:05:11] the meeting and just you know kind of
[1:05:12] going over the calendar and putting down
[1:05:14] different things and so I was marking
[1:05:16] the dates on the uh uh uh of the
[1:05:19] calendar for the beginning of our
[1:05:20] meeting and the first night of our
[1:05:22] meeting on the calendar it said uh the
[1:05:26] beginning of Summer and I I I just I
[1:05:29] just kind of struck me the beginning of
[1:05:30] Summer and I just wrote uh on that date
[1:05:34] uh the you know meeting starts and and
[1:05:37] then underneath that I I wrote um a
[1:05:40] change or a season of change and and you
[1:05:44] know or I think I actually wrote a
[1:05:46] change of season or something along
[1:05:48] those lines because I it just kind of
[1:05:50] stood out to me that the meeting was
[1:05:52] beginning at the chain of a season and
[1:05:55] and and you know and then brother
[1:05:57] Timothy come and he preached that uh
[1:05:59] that message and and the Lord really
[1:06:01] spoke to our hearts and was just dealing
[1:06:03] with people and and and and um I
[1:06:06] remembered back to where the Lord had
[1:06:08] dealt with me at the beginning of that
[1:06:10] year at the at the ending of of uh uh
[1:06:14] 2022 uh the Lord had kind of dealt with
[1:06:16] my heart on some things and and you know
[1:06:19] sometimes you you you you preach a
[1:06:21] sermon and then sometimes the Lord
[1:06:23] there's it's just something special you
[1:06:25] come under the burden of something and
[1:06:28] and you know the ministers will know
[1:06:29] what I'm talking about you just the Lord
[1:06:31] gives you something it becomes a burden
[1:06:33] to you uh and you know that it's going
[1:06:36] to speak directly to to to the church or
[1:06:39] to a need or situations and and and
[1:06:42] that's how the Lord was dealing with me
[1:06:44] and he was dealing with me in a in the
[1:06:46] in this uh direction of a season of
[1:06:48] change and uh you know as I thought
[1:06:51] about that I thought that um you know
[1:06:53] everything is changing I mean you know
[1:06:56] all through our lives everything is
[1:06:58] changing and and change is hard and we
[1:07:00] got to be honest this morning most of us
[1:07:02] don't like change I mean you know if
[1:07:05] we're honest with ourselves change ain't
[1:07:07] easy and and we really don't like it
[1:07:09] because you know we we get accustomed to
[1:07:12] things and and we get in our routines
[1:07:14] and so forth and and so change is not
[1:07:17] easy but yet you can't stop it that's
[1:07:20] right I mean everything is constantly
[1:07:22] changing as a matter of fact there's
[1:07:24] there's only one constant amen there's
[1:07:26] only one thing that never changes and
[1:07:28] that's God and His word outside of that
[1:07:31] everything changes as you know as it's
[1:07:34] always said the only thing that that
[1:07:36] don't change is that everything
[1:07:38] changes because it's just true and and
[1:07:41] you know even in our in our lives you
[1:07:43] know our our personal lives you know we
[1:07:46] we don't stay the same we don't stay the
[1:07:48] same age I know we wish we could but we
[1:07:50] don't and we don't look the same and and
[1:07:53] and you know because we're constantly
[1:07:55] changing brother Brandon would talk
[1:07:57] about it he said of how that nature
[1:07:59] testifies of God he said we find the
[1:08:01] trees and the leaves go off the trees
[1:08:04] and and and and then the life that was
[1:08:06] in the tree goes down into the ground
[1:08:08] like a grave and it'll stay there until
[1:08:10] the Wrath of the winter is passed and
[1:08:12] then it comes back again bringing forth
[1:08:14] new life it's a testimony that we live
[1:08:17] again see the sun rises of a morning
[1:08:19] it's just like a little baby see it's
[1:08:21] weak and then after a while uh in it
[1:08:24] time it it goes through the school and
[1:08:26] then it goes through high school and
[1:08:27] about noon time it's in its strength but
[1:08:30] then in the afternoon it begins to turn
[1:08:32] to the other side and then in the
[1:08:35] evening it begins to get weak again and
[1:08:37] it dies amen but that's not the end of
[1:08:39] the sun it just comes up again the next
[1:08:42] morning to testify Amen to another
[1:08:45] generation that there is life amen and
[1:08:48] and and listen and there's and there's
[1:08:50] also a resurrection Amen brother bam
[1:08:52] says you know that that even the amen
[1:08:55] every day every day the cycle of that
[1:08:57] day is a testimony to you and I amen
[1:09:00] that there is life amen after death and
[1:09:03] there will be a resurrection amen and
[1:09:06] and he takes the the the the the cycle
[1:09:09] of the day and the Sun the different
[1:09:11] phases of the Sun and he ties that with
[1:09:13] our lives and how that we're born that
[1:09:15] would be the morning and and we grow and
[1:09:18] we get stronger but then there's a time
[1:09:20] that it turns and starts going the other
[1:09:22] way and we begin to get weak is that
[1:09:24] right amen he says God's got a time for
[1:09:27] all things he's got a Time see see
[1:09:29] there's a time that we plant corn and
[1:09:31] there's a time that we that we plow and
[1:09:33] there's a time that we Harvest see and
[1:09:35] then the the the spring rains come and
[1:09:38] the and then the drought through the
[1:09:39] summer and the fall rains and the Snows
[1:09:41] and and and and and you just can't say
[1:09:43] well I'll plant my wheat today and then
[1:09:45] tomorrow I'll go out and harvest it no
[1:09:47] amen God has a season see he's got
[1:09:50] seasons for his word he's got seasons in
[1:09:53] the script scripture where it says that
[1:09:54] the presence of the Lord was there to
[1:09:56] heal the sick and that's when Jesus uh
[1:09:59] uh was ministering too see the presence
[1:10:01] of the Lord was there to heal the sick
[1:10:03] maybe at other times the presence of the
[1:10:05] Lord wasn't there to heal the sick but
[1:10:07] we find out that God works everything
[1:10:09] seasonly How We Know by the scripture
[1:10:11] that the angel come down at a certain
[1:10:14] season and troubl the water is that
[1:10:16] right amen see it it was it was the
[1:10:18] season for healing at that time and
[1:10:21] that's what brother Brown was saying and
[1:10:22] he says you got to you got to recognize
[1:10:24] the seasons you got to because you just
[1:10:27] can't go out and plant corn anytime you
[1:10:28] want to amen and let me just say this
[1:10:31] that's why you young people you got
[1:10:33] you're in a special time in your life
[1:10:36] because you're in a planting season see
[1:10:39] you're you're in a season that you're
[1:10:40] actually planting seeds that later
[1:10:43] you're going to harvest because amen the
[1:10:45] Bible says God is Not mocked whatsoever
[1:10:48] a man plants that that whatever he SWS
[1:10:50] that's what he's going to reap see amen
[1:10:52] so whatever kind of seed you seow that's
[1:10:55] the kind of harvest you're going to have
[1:10:57] and let me just say this the only time
[1:10:59] in your life that you can determine amen
[1:11:02] what kind of harvest that you want to
[1:11:04] that you want to reap amen is when
[1:11:06] you're planting the seeds am mean you
[1:11:09] can't you know go out and plant seeds
[1:11:10] and then cultivate in water and if you
[1:11:13] plant corn you're not going to harvest
[1:11:15] green
[1:11:16] beans you see whatever you put in the
[1:11:19] ground and that's that's what's going to
[1:11:20] uh uh come forth and that's what kind of
[1:11:22] harvest you're going to have and that's
[1:11:24] why it's so important that you seow the
[1:11:26] right seed Amen in the planting season
[1:11:30] see others amen here uh this morning
[1:11:33] we're not in the sewing season of our
[1:11:35] life amen we're in the harvest season
[1:11:38] we're actually reaping the seeds that
[1:11:40] we've sown amen and you can look and I
[1:11:42] just say this thank God for Grace amen
[1:11:45] because there's a lot of seeds that I
[1:11:46] wish I would have never sown and amen I
[1:11:48] thank God for Grace I I hope that
[1:11:50] everybody in here amen appreciates the
[1:11:52] grace of God because amen there there's
[1:11:55] a lot of things that we would reap that
[1:11:57] amen listen it wouldn't be so good
[1:11:58] because we didn't always seow the right
[1:12:00] kind of seed amen even as Christians
[1:12:03] that's why amen when you live in a life
[1:12:05] of sin and you plant those kind of seeds
[1:12:07] amen listen even after God saved you and
[1:12:09] fills you with the Holy Ghost many times
[1:12:11] amen you deal with the scars and the and
[1:12:14] those things will come up later in your
[1:12:16] life amen what is it you're harvesting
[1:12:18] what you planted and that's why amen as
[1:12:22] a young person you ought to determine in
[1:12:24] your heart this morning I'm going to
[1:12:25] plant the right kind of seed so that
[1:12:27] I'll have the right kind of harvest
[1:12:30] hallelujah amen I tell you this that's
[1:12:31] what God done amen God Amen didn't wait
[1:12:34] to see how it was all going to turn out
[1:12:36] to determine amen what kind of people he
[1:12:39] was going to have in the end time or
[1:12:41] what kind of harvest he was going to
[1:12:42] have in the Harvest Time amen God
[1:12:44] already made his determination in the
[1:12:46] beginning so he sowed the right kind of
[1:12:48] seed to start with so that in the end
[1:12:51] amen he would have the right kind of
[1:12:52] harvest
[1:12:54] hallelujah amen that's why amen he swed
[1:12:57] amen with a spoken word which is the
[1:12:59] Original Seed and God SED the seed of a
[1:13:02] word bride amen God so the seed of
[1:13:06] Overcomers God so the seed amen of a
[1:13:08] Victorious church and that and because
[1:13:11] that's the kind of seed amen that God
[1:13:13] put in the
[1:13:15] ground that's the kind of harvest that
[1:13:17] God's going to
[1:13:20] have hallelujah amen but for everything
[1:13:24] there's a time and there's a season amen
[1:13:27] watch the prophet of God says amen that
[1:13:30] that Jesus amen even Jesus speaking he
[1:13:33] said the f he he he's praying he said
[1:13:35] the time has come see father the time
[1:13:38] has come and brother BR said there's
[1:13:40] seasons for everything do you believe
[1:13:42] that amen and now you see you sewing a
[1:13:45] certain season you're reaping a certain
[1:13:47] season and there's Seasons when uh uh
[1:13:50] time the time the time comes that it's
[1:13:52] right for for things to happen amen I
[1:13:55] love that there amen there's a season
[1:13:57] that the time comes when it's right for
[1:14:00] things to happen do you believe
[1:14:03] that it's just like in our in our own
[1:14:06] lives and I'm just going to follow the
[1:14:09] leadership of the holy spirit because to
[1:14:10] be honest with you I had something
[1:14:12] completely different but the Lord just
[1:14:15] kept pulling me back in this
[1:14:16] direction and and and you know I
[1:14:19] remember years ago the first time I ever
[1:14:23] come uh to down here to Louisiana and
[1:14:27] and come to the church brother Tim told
[1:14:30] me back in the office he said he he said
[1:14:32] brother Josh he said don't you get in
[1:14:34] your mind because this is brother Tim
[1:14:36] puis church that we don't have no
[1:14:38] problems or we don't have he said
[1:14:39] there's problems in this church just
[1:14:41] like any other church and there's people
[1:14:43] that need help and there's people that
[1:14:45] need deliverance and there's people that
[1:14:46] need healing and and and you know that
[1:14:49] really helped me as a as a as a as a
[1:14:51] young pastor at the time
[1:14:53] uh it really spoke to me because I
[1:14:55] thought you know what that really
[1:14:57] encouraged my heart because sometimes
[1:14:59] you know you you get things in your mind
[1:15:01] that you know that you know well uh that
[1:15:04] that church don't have no issues or that
[1:15:06] church and and and and and you fail to
[1:15:09] recognize amen that listen it don't
[1:15:11] matter where you're at or what church
[1:15:13] you're in or what group you're preaching
[1:15:15] to there's
[1:15:17] needs amen because people are there and
[1:15:20] people are needy and and that's not a
[1:15:22] you know condescending in any kind of
[1:15:24] way amen we're just
[1:15:26] human amen and and that's why amen the
[1:15:30] holy spirit is dealt with my heart many
[1:15:31] times amen it's not just about preaching
[1:15:34] good sermons and putting quotes together
[1:15:36] and and tying things together amen
[1:15:39] sometimes we just need to be a real
[1:15:40] minister of the gospel and let the holy
[1:15:43] spirit amen speak through us to minister
[1:15:45] to the needs that are laying in the
[1:15:48] body and I trust by the help of God that
[1:15:51] that that we can do that today but but
[1:15:53] as we look at this because you know we
[1:15:56] have seasons in our own lives and I want
[1:15:57] to as we go forward in this service I I
[1:16:00] I'm going to be using you know us as
[1:16:03] individuals and then at times I'll be
[1:16:05] speaking to uh the church because listen
[1:16:08] you will go through Seasons as an
[1:16:11] individual and and also the church
[1:16:14] collectively as a body will go through
[1:16:17] Seasons listen churches go through
[1:16:19] Seasons just like you go through as an
[1:16:22] individual not always on the
[1:16:25] mountain and churches are not always on
[1:16:27] on the mountain toop listen every every
[1:16:31] service that we have we're not always
[1:16:33] you know in the shout and Revival or or
[1:16:35] whatever more and that don't mean that
[1:16:37] the spirit of God has left the
[1:16:39] church amen it just means you're going
[1:16:42] through something you see and and you as
[1:16:45] an individual you're going through
[1:16:46] seasons in your life and and brother B
[1:16:48] was talk about in in leadership he said
[1:16:51] remember each one of us as young uh
[1:16:53] young and old the first step we ever
[1:16:55] made in in our life someone had to lead
[1:16:57] you see that's right and the last step
[1:16:59] you ever make someone will be leading
[1:17:01] you somebody has to lead you in the
[1:17:03] first step was probably ever taken amen
[1:17:06] he said was probably in the hands of
[1:17:08] some kind old mother and them hands may
[1:17:10] be still tonight out there in the
[1:17:11] cemetery somewhere but that was a hand
[1:17:13] that held you to to make your first step
[1:17:16] and then after your mother taught you
[1:17:17] how to walk and and you made a few steps
[1:17:19] and fall down and get up and and you
[1:17:21] thought you were doing great things and
[1:17:23] she turned you over then to the school
[1:17:25] teacher and then she began to lead you
[1:17:27] to an education and how you must do and
[1:17:29] how you must learn and so forth like
[1:17:31] that and after the teacher got through
[1:17:33] with you then you returned back to the
[1:17:34] father and the father got a hold of you
[1:17:36] and then when your father got a hold of
[1:17:38] you he taught you perhaps your business
[1:17:39] and how to be successful and how to do
[1:17:42] things right and see your mother taught
[1:17:43] you how to be a housewife and how to
[1:17:45] cook and so forth and all this amen but
[1:17:47] then he says and then after they got
[1:17:49] through with you then your minister or
[1:17:51] or the priest got a hold of you and then
[1:17:53] he asked the questions but he said but
[1:17:55] but who leads you now amen amen who's
[1:17:58] leading you now that's the question amen
[1:18:01] we're all led by something amen we have
[1:18:03] to be because we're LED amen and so you
[1:18:06] see what the prophet is saying we're
[1:18:08] we're we're growing we don't stay
[1:18:10] children and we don't stay in the same
[1:18:13] season of our life you know I know by as
[1:18:15] a parent I didn't want my kids to grow
[1:18:20] up you know I said I I I said it at the
[1:18:23] church one time I said we don't want our
[1:18:24] kids to grow up and I just felt it I
[1:18:26] said well you know I know some of you
[1:18:29] do cuz you got 25 year olds still living
[1:18:33] with you and stuff like that amen you
[1:18:36] think man you don't know the you don't
[1:18:37] know my kids I want my kids to grow up
[1:18:41] but I'm talking about you know I got a a
[1:18:44] little picture over her on my nightstand
[1:18:46] beside my bed of my two little girls

[1:18:51] just little girls you know and and
[1:18:53] sometimes I look over that and I just

[1:18:56] help myself I think what in the world
[1:19:00] happened how do we get here you know how
[1:19:03] did this happen cuz I didn't want them
[1:19:05] to grow up I to I told the church a
[1:19:06] while back I said you know I remember as
[1:19:08] a as a as a as a young boy growing up in
[1:19:11] the message and I remember you know we
[1:19:13] thought the Lord was coming any day I
[1:19:15] mean we just you know it's just like
[1:19:16] brother Tim said you know who who would
[1:19:18] ever thought you know here we are
[1:19:20] 2024 am mean and and and I remember
[1:19:23] growing up and and you know I thought

[1:20:08] pray if I if you could just allow me to
[1:20:10] to to get married and just you know have
[1:20:12] this experience and and then I got
[1:20:14] married and I thought Lord I want a
[1:20:16] family so bad if I I just want children
[1:20:18] you know and I'm telling you I'm just
[1:20:20] being honest with you am me I just pray
[1:20:23] in that way Lord if you could just T
[1:20:24] there's just things I you know I would
[1:20:26] love to do and love to experience amen
[1:20:28] but then I had children and as they
[1:20:31] begin to grow up my prayers completely
[1:20:34] changed I said Lord please come before
[1:20:36] they get their
[1:20:41] license you know my prayer completely
[1:20:44] turned other way and I begin to pray oh
[1:20:46] God please come before they get
[1:20:49] married amen amen you see but but but
[1:20:52] you know as much as we would love to
[1:20:54] keep our children small it don't matter
[1:20:57] what you do you cannot stop the
[1:21:00] change you'll never prevent them from
[1:21:03] growing up they're going to grow and if
[1:21:04] you keep keep uh treating them like a
[1:21:07] child and treating them like a baby
[1:21:10] you're going to ruin their
[1:21:11] lives amen listen as they change your
[1:21:14] relationship with them's got to change
[1:21:16] how you speak to them and how you handle
[1:21:18] them it's got to change amen as they're
[1:21:21] changing
[1:21:26] see even as we're growing in in the
[1:21:28] changes of the cycles of our life
[1:21:30] brother Brown talked about every seven
[1:21:32] years every seven years your life
[1:21:34] changes see and then he said seven time
[1:21:38] seven you see that's a complete uh uh
[1:21:41] change and it bothers the women and and
[1:21:44] and Men usually get kind of funny
[1:21:47] carrying on during that time sometimes
[1:21:49] they leave their wives
[1:21:51] and we what is it they're going through
[1:21:53] a what they call in the world a midlife
[1:21:57] crisis really what it is is they're
[1:21:59] having a hard time
[1:22:01] accepting what they're becoming
[1:22:04] see and and and and and nobody wants to
[1:22:07] get
[1:22:07] old but every but but but you know if
[1:22:10] you if you continue to
[1:22:13] live I mean it's just the
[1:22:16] process you you can't CH you can't
[1:22:18] change this kind of like brother Homer
[1:22:20] uh always says brother Homer longor he
[1:22:22] said the the the only good thing about
[1:22:24] getting old is some didn't but you know
[1:22:27] but but you just can't help it I mean if
[1:22:30] you live if you continue to live you're
[1:22:32] going to you're going to age you're
[1:22:33] going to get old things are going to
[1:22:36] change and so you you know you just
[1:22:39] can't stop it and brother Brown that's
[1:22:40] what he's showing every seven years
[1:22:43] you're going through a cycle of change
[1:22:45] in your life and I've found that to be
[1:22:46] true and if you really watch and study
[1:22:49] it out you'll see that that is so true
[1:22:51] and then seven times seven he said now
[1:22:53] that's a complete change it's usually
[1:22:55] about that time that a woman is going
[1:22:57] through the the change of life and you
[1:22:59] can even tie this back to the scripture
[1:23:01] because in the scripture amen every
[1:23:03] seven years God had provided a grace to
[1:23:07] the children of Israel amen and he had
[1:23:09] something was called the year of release
[1:23:11] that would happen after every seven
[1:23:13] years amen you know what that was amen
[1:23:15] that every seven years was like an A A
[1:23:18] an amateure Jubilee to the children of
[1:23:20] Israel amen but that was the grace of
[1:23:23] God making provision for them amen that
[1:23:26] even though if they got in a in a
[1:23:28] condition of
[1:23:29] slavery or a condition of bondage God
[1:23:33] made sure he made a way they didn't have
[1:23:34] to stay
[1:23:36] there hallelujah amen I'm glad to know
[1:23:40] this amen this morning amen I don't know
[1:23:42] what kind of season you're in in your
[1:23:44] life but I know this amen we all amen
[1:23:47] you're either going in a trial or you're
[1:23:49] in the middle of it now or you just come
[1:23:51] out of one amen but no matter where
[1:23:53] you're at I can tell you this it won't
[1:23:56] last
[1:23:59] forever hallelujah amen you might be in
[1:24:02] a struggle you might be in a season of
[1:24:04] Oppression amen but God has provided a
[1:24:07] Grace hallelujah amen there is a time of
[1:24:12] release amen and the Jubilee when that
[1:24:15] Jubilee trumpet sounded that was the
[1:24:17] grace of God sounding Out amen letting
[1:24:20] his children know I'll not leave you in
[1:24:22] bondage I'll not leave you a slave I'll
[1:24:25] not leave you in oppression amen but in
[1:24:28] every trial I've made a way of
[1:24:31] [Applause]
[1:24:34] Escape what is this showing us amen
[1:24:37] these things are
[1:24:40] temporary amen amen if you're in a
[1:24:42] season amen don't worry it's going to
[1:24:47] change because Seasons continually
[1:24:50] change so brother Brown's talking about
[1:24:52] that and how the cycles of every seven
[1:24:54] years amen our lives
[1:24:57] change he brings it to that seven sevens
[1:25:00] and by the time you hit 50 you know in
[1:25:03] in that season of
[1:25:05] life he said it gets real hard that's
[1:25:08] right he said and he said you know we
[1:25:13] all go through that and we must
[1:25:16] remember that it's it it it's that it's
[1:25:20] things that we must bear with one
[1:25:25] another and understand those
[1:25:29] things I I want to just tell you this
[1:25:31] because I don't know you know I don't
[1:25:33] know about all y'all problems I don't
[1:25:36] know what goes on in this church I
[1:25:38] really don't I don't you know I don't
[1:25:41] know but I know enough to know
[1:25:44] this you're going through
[1:25:48] something and I know that there's been a
[1:25:50] lot of changes in this church yes and
[1:25:53] through the years you've moved from you
[1:25:55] know different buildings and and there's
[1:25:57] been a lot of changes new people come
[1:26:00] and and I can I I I know this by
[1:26:03] experience been pastoring about 12 years
[1:26:06] now
[1:26:08] and you know went into little church
[1:26:11] there and started pastoring and people
[1:26:13] started coming you know other things was
[1:26:15] happening in the area and you know um
[1:26:18] with other churches and you know I'm not
[1:26:20] to say anything negative about anybody
[1:26:22] or anything like that but there was just
[1:26:24] situations and and people needed a place
[1:26:26] to go and people started coming to
[1:26:28] church and and you think man ain't that
[1:26:31] wonderful the church is growing bless
[1:26:33] God you know everything's wonderful but
[1:26:36] you found out
[1:26:37] that it's not always that way
[1:26:40] Hallelujah because you know when you're
[1:26:43] growing there's something that's called
[1:26:44] growing
[1:26:46] pains and Things become a struggle and
[1:26:48] new people come in and and older people
[1:26:52] are are beginning to feel pushed to the
[1:26:54] side and people are feeling like they're
[1:26:56] losing their
[1:26:58] value and and and and I find that in in
[1:27:01] even in the in the natural course of
[1:27:03] life you take a mother and her children
[1:27:05] begin to grow up and she has dedicated
[1:27:07] her whole life a real mama and she's
[1:27:09] been a real mother in the home and she's
[1:27:11] raised them children and she's gave her
[1:27:13] whole life to them children and as they
[1:27:14] grow up and leave the house and and
[1:27:16] they're going out on their own that that
[1:27:18] little mama she'll begin to she'll begin
[1:27:21] to feel like she's losing her her uh
[1:27:24] purpose in life she'll begin to feel
[1:27:26] like that you know I'm not important any
[1:27:28] I'm not needed nobody needs me amen I
[1:27:30] don't have no purpose because amen all
[1:27:33] she ever knew and all she had ever done
[1:27:34] was was give her life to raising her
[1:27:36] children and being a mother and and
[1:27:38] things of that of that nature amen but
[1:27:40] but but see what they got to realize is
[1:27:42] is things are changing amen but they're
[1:27:45] just as
[1:27:46] valuable amen they're just as valuable
[1:27:49] in their position if they can find their
[1:27:51] position listen listen I I've seen it so
[1:27:53] many times through the years amen older
[1:27:56] people in the church as young people
[1:27:57] come in and and and and you know and
[1:27:59] they're talented and they got a lot of
[1:28:01] zeal and a lot of energy and they're
[1:28:03] willing to work and to do and amen and
[1:28:05] all of a sudden the older people begin
[1:28:06] to feel pushed aside and and they feel
[1:28:09] like well I'm not needed and you know
[1:28:10] I'm not valuable but listen for
[1:28:12] somebody's got to be a pillar in the
[1:28:15] church somebody has got to take that
[1:28:18] position amen as others go over and
[1:28:20] cross the river and go over into glory
[1:28:23] amen somebody's got to be the old oak
[1:28:24] tree that gives shade and amen
[1:28:27] somebody's got to be that tie that that
[1:28:29] strong tie post that that one that we
[1:28:31] can look to as an
[1:28:34] example amen so I want to tell every
[1:28:36] person in this church you're important
[1:28:38] and you're needed and you got a a
[1:28:42] value amen you got a
[1:28:45] position amen and the Church of the
[1:28:47] Living God is not the same without

[1:35:01] recognized that it's a time that he can
[1:35:03] wreck
[1:35:04] women that he can wreck the church that
[1:35:07] he can wreck the people he's recognized
[1:35:13] it because Satan is an
[1:35:18] opportunist I tell you something he hits
[1:35:21] you when you're
[1:35:23] down Satan knows just when to come to
[1:35:26] you amen that's why amen listen he can
[1:35:30] recognize amen when a when a when a when
[1:35:32] a sister is going through that time in
[1:35:34] her life you watch The Devil come and
[1:35:38] begin to
[1:35:39] attack see he be come right there and
[1:35:43] begin to attack even a brother the same
[1:35:46] way watch a
[1:35:49] church you guys know all about it you
[1:35:53] build a
[1:35:56] church that's
[1:35:57] stress it's like it's like trying to

[1:36:03] maintain your
[1:36:07] marriage amen I don't know if y'all some
[1:36:10] of y'all maybe never uh yeah he said be
[1:36:12] careful I better be
[1:36:14] careful I built two houses amen and and
[1:36:17] then we built a church amen but I know
[1:36:19] by experience that that br
[1:36:21] stress because there's everybody's got
[1:36:23] an opinion and everybody's you know and
[1:36:26] and everybody wants to be recognized and
[1:36:28] oh we could go on and on and on but it
[1:36:30] brings stress but watch that's just
[1:36:32] that's just
[1:36:34] Humanity that's just being
[1:36:37] human until the Devil comes and attaches
[1:36:41] himself to that and a spirit starts
[1:36:44] working and what was just a little
[1:36:46] disagreement over an opinion of color or
[1:36:50] or or where wall should be or the kind
[1:36:53] of lights or whatever is going on Amen
[1:36:55] then the spirit comes in and that little
[1:36:58] division right there amen Satan will
[1:37:01] attach himself to it are you are you
[1:37:02] following what I'm saying listen friends
[1:37:04] I tell you what we got to do we we need
[1:37:06] to recognize
[1:37:08] Satan and his
[1:37:10] tactics I've asked my church at home
[1:37:13] before I said listen how long are we
[1:37:14] going to keep allowing the Devil to come
[1:37:18] in Among Us and divide us
[1:37:22] how long are we going to keep allowing
[1:37:24] Satan Amen to come in among families and
[1:37:27] stir up trouble in the church listen

[1:37:32] the most high God Amen and we have the
[1:37:35] authority as the sons of God Amen to put
[1:37:39] the devil in his place Hallelujah and
[1:37:42] real overcoming is this is recognizing
[1:37:44] Satan and all his tactics the first
[1:37:47] thing we need to do is realize this is

[1:40:53] himself to a natural condition that this
[1:40:56] woman was going through a cycle of the
[1:40:58] change in her life but Satan was going

[1:41:41] can still deliver Hallelujah he can
[1:41:44] still change a heart change a
[1:41:47] [Applause]
[1:41:49] life
[1:41:52] Lord you know brother brand would even
[1:41:54] encourage the husbands he says at the
[1:41:57] time he said that your wife is going
[1:41:59] through that he said if she was ever
[1:42:01] your
[1:42:01] sweetheart he said you let her be then
[1:42:04] hallelujah see you got to have patience
[1:42:08] and and and and and and compassion and
[1:42:11] understanding and I got a thinking about
[1:42:13] that and I thought about you know even
[1:42:16] back home my own church you know and I
[1:42:18] thought about all the changes that's
[1:42:21] going that that's happened in that
[1:42:22] church and sometimes it gets frustrating
[1:42:25] I'm just being honest sometimes it's
[1:42:27] been frustrating as a pastor it's been
[1:42:30] very frustrating and you know and and
[1:42:32] and you know in dealing with the
[1:42:33] complaints and you know there's been
[1:42:35] times I felt like I was Pastor in three
[1:42:37] different churches at one time in one
[1:42:39] building amen but you know you just get
[1:42:42] real frustrated and you're and and
[1:42:44] you're dealing with all these situations
[1:42:45] and it's easy in that frustration to
[1:42:48] even uh you know lash out and and and
[1:42:51] things like that but then I begin to
[1:42:52] read something like this and the prophet
[1:42:54] says see when when if you're a husband
[1:42:56] amen amen you got to be you got to have
[1:42:58] compassion understanding and amen and
[1:43:01] and be patient and I got to thinking
[1:43:03] about I thought oh God I'm thankful that
[1:43:05] God is patient with me amen when I'm
[1:43:07] going through my struggles amen when I'm
[1:43:10] I'm going through the hard times and the
[1:43:12] disappointing and the discouraging times
[1:43:14] and amen when I don't feel like a
[1:43:15] Christian how many how many's glad that
[1:43:17] God even didn't throw you
[1:43:19] away how many's glad that God Amen just
[1:43:22] because he was going through a struggle
[1:43:24] amen and a hard time and and you got a
[1:43:26] little discouraged and depressed amen
[1:43:28] I'm glad that God didn't just throw us
[1:43:29] to the side and look for another amen
[1:43:32] but he have patience and understanding
[1:43:34] and compassion and love and mercy and
[1:43:46] Grace but see we're going through these
[1:43:49] Cycles these
[1:43:53] changes he said let's think of brother
[1:43:55] BR I'm just going to read a quote to you
[1:43:57] out of uh the testimony of a true
[1:44:00] witness he said let's just think of a
[1:44:02] tree the fall of the year when the
[1:44:04] Autumn time is is here now when a when a
[1:44:08] we we take a leaf and that's that's like
[1:44:11] a a life and we are if we're born again
[1:44:15] we are a leaf on the tree of life and
[1:44:18] the tree uh that we see out here in the
[1:44:20] Woods the life finally leaves and pulls
[1:44:23] away from that leaf because the season
[1:44:25] is over for the leaf and the leav of uh
[1:44:29] of uh the leaves will begin to fall and
[1:44:32] drop down when the life leaves it see
[1:44:35] and we're real sure of that we look amen
[1:44:37] from every window now amen and the Le
[1:44:40] he's in this is in the fall of the year
[1:44:42] amen they'll begin to drop he said now
[1:44:44] that's the body we bury amen but that
[1:44:47] life that was in that leaf goes back
[1:44:49] down to where it comes from down there
[1:44:51] through the tree Amen to the root and it
[1:44:54] remains there in the root of the tree
[1:44:56] until another season see for this season
[1:45:00] the sun is rocked away from or or the
[1:45:02] Earth is rocked away from the Sun and
[1:45:04] it's following in its orbit and it goes
[1:45:06] around amen way away and the cold
[1:45:09] weather is headed down to the Earth
[1:45:10] therefore the root holds that life of
[1:45:13] that leaf until the Earth rocks back
[1:45:15] around again and then there's no way to
[1:45:17] ever hide that leaf from coming back
[1:45:20] it'll come back just as sure as the sun
[1:45:21] comes back it'll come back amen but it
[1:45:24] has to wait for another season before it
[1:45:26] comes back and today that gives us a
[1:45:28] great testimony as a witness of God of
[1:45:30] creation amen because that's when we are
[1:45:33] uh we are in the season of mortal life
[1:45:36] see right now we're in the season of
[1:45:38] mortal life raising our children
[1:45:40] marrying and bringing forth families
[1:45:42] amen this is a life amen or the season
[1:45:44] of mortal life amen but when we have
[1:45:47] been born of above amen when that body
[1:45:50] returns turns to the dust from where it
[1:45:51] come and the spirit goes amen for where
[1:45:54] it come goes up Amen to where it come
[1:45:56] from Amen to God who gave it amen there
[1:45:58] will come another season and that season
[1:46:01] that will come will be the immortal
[1:46:03] season and when the Son of God Rises
[1:46:06] with healing in his wings amen it'll be
[1:46:09] totally impossible to hold those body in
[1:46:12] the ground any longer they'll come forth
[1:46:14] in the brightness of the Son of God very
[1:46:16] nature itself testifies of that if we're
[1:46:19] Christians and we're born of the spirit
[1:46:21] death can't hold nothing but victory for
[1:46:23] us hallelujah because these old
[1:46:25] corruptible bodies amen Satan still has
[1:46:28] power over that will drop into dust of
[1:46:30] the earth amen but when the season
[1:46:33] Hallelujah this is the wrong season now
[1:46:35] it's mortal season but when the immortal
[1:46:38] season is coming when the immortal one
[1:46:40] comes he will bring with him the
[1:46:42] immortal Spirits amen that has returned
[1:46:45] to him from the earth and they shall
[1:46:46] come forth again in the resurrection for
[1:46:49] the great Millennium and shall shall
[1:46:50] Shine for His

[1:59:00] one day and I thought you know what amen
[1:59:02] God made an appointment with Sarah to

[1:59:09] brother Brown said Jesus keeps all his
[1:59:15] appointments hallelujah amen oh I love
[1:59:18] that amen because he's made an
[1:59:20] appointment with us and he's going to

[1:59:27] Sarah amen listen friends and I tell you
[1:59:30] what their their conditions got
[1:59:32] worse do you imagine God gave Abraham a
[1:59:35] promise and nothing changed for the
[1:59:38] better except amen the faith he had in
[1:59:42] his
[1:59:43] heart cuz Abraham got
[1:59:46] older and Sarah got older and they
[1:59:49] conditions got worse and their bodies
[1:59:51] got worse is that right amen but you
[1:59:55] know what I love about the Lord God
[1:59:57] never changed or adjusted his
[2:00:00] promise because of their
[2:00:05] condition God didn't change his word
[2:00:08] because of their condition by the way
[2:00:11] they couldn't do it at their
[2:00:15] best amen even at their very best they
[2:00:18] couldn't produce
[2:00:19] it but yet God promised it you know what
[2:00:23] it tells me brother if God made you a
[2:00:27] promise he is
[2:00:29] obligated to make a way to fulfill
[2:00:33] it and I'm going I want to let you know
[2:00:36] he'll move Heaven and
[2:00:39] Earth amen and listen brother Bron even
[2:00:41] says he said listen they couldn't do it
[2:00:44] in the bodies they were
[2:00:45] in God had promised them a son and they
[2:00:48] couldn't produ it in the bodies they
[2:00:50] were in amen so instead of God changes
[2:00:52] his word to match their body he changed
[2:00:55] their body to match his
[2:00:57] word hallelujah and let me just say this
[2:01:00] this morning amen God is not going to
[2:01:03] change his word to match our
[2:01:06] conditions amen he's going to change our
[2:01:08] bodies to match his word hallelujah

[2:01:27] season of it
[2:01:33] now I'm going to close right
[2:01:36] here I ain't got no idea about
[2:01:39] time amen but I'm going to tell I want
[2:01:42] to just show you something I got
[2:01:45] this all right praise
[2:01:48] God
[2:01:51] I was I was studying everybody everybody
[2:01:53] studied the message countdown right and
[2:01:55] brother Brandon will take and he'll
[2:01:58] parallel scientific
[2:02:00] achievement with uh spiritual
[2:02:03] achievement right and he shows he brings
[2:02:06] it right through the church and I'm not
[2:02:07] going to go through the whole message
[2:02:10] but but I was I was looking at you know
[2:02:12] how brother Brown would make the
[2:02:13] parallel with transportation and he
[2:02:15] shows how the man had moved from the
[2:02:16] horse and buggy to the automobile to the
[2:02:19] airplane to the astronaut
[2:02:22] age and I was studying that a while back
[2:02:24] and I and I was studying
[2:02:27] the how and I just got a thinking and
[2:02:31] you know
[2:02:32] science is always
[2:02:35] changing
[2:02:36] advancing
[2:02:38] technology is continuing to advance all
[2:02:41] the time you can't even hardly keep up
[2:02:43] with it and the phone you buy today
[2:02:46] it'll be obsolete tomorrow don't worry
[2:02:49] but you know and all as it advances and
[2:02:52] and as I got to studying that I run
[2:02:55] across an
[2:02:57] article and they said that by the year
[2:03:01] 2050 humans could outlive the
[2:03:04] constraints of the physical
[2:03:07] body this is actual article I'm reading
[2:03:10] to you says undoubtedly we are currently
[2:03:14] experiencing an age of shift of
[2:03:16] technology and advancements
[2:03:18] breakthroughs are emerging in fields
[2:03:20] such as AI uh uh uh which is artificial
[2:03:25] intelligence and it says that and
[2:03:28] nanotechnologies and and just in the
[2:03:30] past decade we have witnessed remarkable
[2:03:33] progress in science bringing us closer
[2:03:36] to a future where artificial
[2:03:38] intelligence will be present everywhere
[2:03:40] in our daily
[2:03:41] lives we are currently facing the
[2:03:44] possibility this is from a different
[2:03:46] article listen to this we are currently
[2:03:49] facing the possibility of achieve of
[2:03:52] achieving immortality for humans by
[2:03:57] 2030 this prediction comes from renowned
[2:04:01] uh uh scientists and futurists who who
[2:04:04] have history of making accurate
[2:04:07] predictions he anticipates that the
[2:04:10] ongoing progress in genetics robotics
[2:04:13] nanotechnology will soon have Nanobots
[2:04:15] that we will soon have Nanobots cursing
[2:04:18] through our bloodstream dream and which
[2:04:19] would en enable us to live forever see
[2:04:23] it's truly remarkable to consider that
[2:04:25] this could be a reality within just
[2:04:27] seven years this was in 2023 that this
[2:04:29] was wrote in just seven years and it
[2:04:32] says amen that that that in just in that
[2:04:35] short period of time that humans could
[2:04:37] reach immortality but you got to
[2:04:41] understand they're not talking about
[2:04:42] that you could just live forever in the
[2:04:44] body that you're in see even they
[2:04:47] understand that these bodies
[2:04:49] have absolute limitations in other words
[2:04:52] they could say with all the advancement
[2:04:53] of Med medical science and all the
[2:04:55] medicine they could give you and if you
[2:04:57] you know followed their instructions and
[2:04:59] done the correct exercise and ate the
[2:05:01] right things and drank the right things
[2:05:03] eventually your body's just going to
[2:05:05] wear out and they said that they believe
[2:05:07] that a man could could live up to maybe
[2:05:10] 150 years and even in the near future
[2:05:12] amen that humans could live you know
[2:05:14] reach that threshold of 150 years uh if
[2:05:17] they would follow these instructions and
[2:05:20] and live you know clean and eat clean
[2:05:22] and and and and and you know uh go to
[2:05:24] the doctor on regular basis and and
[2:05:26] these things that man could live up to
[2:05:28] 150 years but but these
[2:05:30] bodies have absolute limitation I got to
[2:05:34] reading this article and I thought man
[2:05:36] amen this is so powerful because science
[2:05:39] is now talking about immortality amen
[2:05:43] being in the reach of humanity within
[2:05:46] the next seven years amen but listen and
[2:05:50] but yet they know that you can't do it
[2:05:52] in this
[2:05:54] body Hallelujah and they also know that
[2:05:58] it would take a higher
[2:06:01] intelligence Amen to take us into that
[2:06:04] immortality and I got to thinking about
[2:06:06] that and I thought you know what Amen in
[2:06:08] the parallel Amen in the same thought of
[2:06:10] brother Brandon parallel and the
[2:06:12] scientific achievement with a spiritual
[2:06:14] a achievement where are we at this
[2:06:16] morning church how close if science is
[2:06:19] declaring amen that we can experience
[2:06:22] immortality in the next seven
[2:06:24] years you know what they're really
[2:06:26] trying to do amen by Ai and Nanobots and
[2:06:30] so forth they're trying to capture the
[2:06:32] real
[2:06:33] you so that they can transport that into
[2:06:37] another
[2:06:38] body so that you can continue to live
[2:06:41] amen listen and if they're amen they're
[2:06:44] beginning to say it's within our reach
[2:06:46] now amen we're almost there
[2:06:49] what about you and I this morning if
[2:06:51] science is that
[2:06:54] close how close are
[2:06:57] we Hallelujah I say if science is that
[2:07:00] close I tell you what amen my
[2:07:03] expectation ain't in seven years it
[2:07:05] might happen it could happen in the
[2:07:08] morning Hallelujah you say brother what
[2:07:11] do you say I'm telling you this we may
[2:07:14] never see
[2:07:15] 2024 amen but I tell you what if it
[2:07:18] don't happen tomorrow I'll look for it
[2:07:20] the next day and if it don't happen then
[2:07:23] I'll be looking for it the next day amen
[2:07:26] because I got a promise and this is a
[2:07:28] season of change and it's already
[2:07:31] started and all the devils in hell can't
[2:07:34] stop
[2:07:37] it Hallelujah no more than you can stop
[2:07:41] the Sun from coming up in the morning no
[2:07:44] more than you can stop the changes amen
