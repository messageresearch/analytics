you that are here in the service with us praying that the Lord will just meet that need whatever that you have a man we're just pray that he'll just come today in a mighty way for your life amen god bless you thank you let's let's turn to Philippians 2 and verse 5 I want to go there again this morning as there are some things that I would like to share here about the mind of Christ and today we're going to be speaking of the bride has the mind of Christ now want you just to really tune in today and pray for me as you are tuning in just asking God does that give your brother Tim the utterance that is needed to minister life to us through the word and I want you to look look past what you see a man I want you to look into the unseen so I want you to look past what you what you see everything that you see that is going on in the world and then the problems that you're facing right now I want you to look past it look beyond that see something that is greater that is actually happening and I want you to think past your thinking I want you to go way beyond what you've been thinking until you can you can think as he thinks I'm an exceeding above abundantly above what you are able to think our ask and get into the mind of God because the bride has the mind of Christ and that's what we're speaking on this morning is the my bride has the mind of Christ Philippians 2 and verse 5 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross amens of the mind that was in Christ brought him into obedience to the will of God amen so when we're saying let this mind being us let it bring us in humility humbling down to the will of God for our lives and for this day this age that we're living in because we have a word to fulfill god bless you can be seated we've been speaking now for nearly two years upon the people of the book we've titled you know went through a lot of different teams as we have done and that we started with this thought of the people of the book have returned to the land of the book and and today we're going to take it into in this land the the bride has the mind of Christ and that's that's where we are in this time where that the mind of Christ has been revealed to a generation two people in this last day to prepare her for the rapture of the church and and so even when God made man and and created even the animal world he made them all spirits but only man he gave a soul and in the soul there is a conscience and and so it it almost makes us too where that we are a dual creature that we are one born of heaven and yet we're living in a body that has been born of the earth so it makes us makes us of a dual dual creature in in some ways of dual nature and that we're still human but yet we are born sons of God and and so we within our soul there is a consciousness which brother branham would call the sub-conscience now in the subconscious he would explain even his visions was like this he said that he said like when you go to sleep and you dream he said now that's part of you somewhere and and he said many times it's things that you were thinking about that happened to me last night I drove a drove by brother Timothy's garden and I saw his beans said were there and knowing he's away from home and and the beans are probably on the vines I couldn't see them but just come and buy them I was thinking you know della those probably need to be picked and you know they're they're probably coming to the point of fruition and so they're you know during the night I dream about the beans and and some of them are overripe and we're having to shell them and you know like that because they had went too long it was a result of my subconscious mind in the night but it was a part of me somewhere right and so brother branham said about his visions he said the visions he says you don't dream he said it's like a dream he said you see it and of course some dreams are from God and so again he said some people don't dream at all and he said your your subconscious as far as from here to the wall but other people their there their subconscious is closer and God can deal in that sub-conscience and even give spiritual dreams and dreams that will mean things for years to come you know I've I've had I've had that many of those like that that that have come to very very true very come to pass exactly I remember you know the Lord sometimes just gives them to you just for his His grace to help you to deal with a situation that he knows you're gonna deal with I remember when I was raised in rat terriers for example you know I had a little dog there that I bought him and I had some puppies that were expected to be born and so I had to go away in preach and so I'd called home several times about Maya but about the dog and you know checked on it and even called that morning before I got on the plane how is that how is that dog you know it's fine everything's okay and and but but I'd had a dream that night and I dreamed us coming in and I walked from the car directly to the box were that the the dog would the kennel that it was in lifted up the lid and looked down and there was the dog laying there dead and a puppy laying right beside it dead and so you know I had that dream so I called whoa check on this dog and when I got a home I I walked right in and as I did I walked straight to the kennel and straight to the box and there the dog was laying there dead and the puppy exactly as I'd seen it in the dream now you see sometimes those are when a dream like that comes to pass is actually a vision that happens in your sub-conscience it's the same as a vision and and some are gifted that way in order to because he said that in the last days I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and he said old men will dream dreams and young men will see visions and so brother Bantam said about a vision he said now your sub-conscience is right here and the and he said they're together and he said you're standing away you're not sleep but in a vision you're awake and your sub-conscience right here and you're actually watching things that has happened in the past and it's as though they're present and you're hearing voices you're seeing things that are even in the future and that all happens he says in the sub-conscience round and so you know that that was again showing us the mind of Christ was here and that it is coming so close that we even see with the prophets ministry it was so close that he could even be awake and recognize things that were happening in the spirit round is everybody with me now and of course it is also a sign to us that Christ is here because only Christ can discern the thoughts and the intents of the heart and so he is here he was in the farm of the word because the word knows the thoughts and intents of heart and can divide the asunder between the soul and the spirit so it was identifying that the word was here but yet I'm at the same time it shows us that Christ is here in bride form that that was his mind working among us now again when we have the message as I preached last Sunday and we received the opening of the seals that was the mind of Christ that was being revealed to us God thinking not a theologian not a man's idea or theologians interpretation but God's own mind that being Express to an age in this day through a seer a prophet whose sub-conscience could be right here and he can't be in that round while standing in this realm at the same time now again but but when we talk about that we we also know that the man who is unconverted his sub-conscience is also there but he it is tainted with that which is evil I'd like to go with it wouldn't you to go with me to Genesis 6 and 5 because the unconverted man is led by what he sees and his senses declare that now Genesis 6 and 5 and God saw the wickedness of man was great in the earth and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually so now we're going to look at here because right here in a time where the mind of Christ is being poured out we also see the mind of Satan is being poured out because we are again as it was in the days of Noah where God destroyed the earth the first time because the wickedness of man was great in the earth and every imagination and his thoughts of his heart was only evil continually if you look with me to Genesis 8:21 we'll will read this portion for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth so now here again if you look here we're just taking that portion out the imagination of man's heart this is after the blood is evil from his youth so there is an inherent nature of evil of darkness that we receive by our first birth and this is what we must die to and we must be born again now again Jesus agreed with him sin Matthew 15:19 for out of the heart notice yes out of the heart that's where the that sub-conscience lays proceedeth on evil thoughts murders and adulteries fornications thefts false witness blasphemies these are the things which defile a man so notice again out of the heart proceedeth evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications thefts false witnesses and blasphemies and again the because there is an anointing that has come down even to anoint the evil passions of men in this last day as Satan is about to become incarnate in the people are you with me Amen now but at the same time God is becoming incarnate in his church and they will have the mind of Christ so now the new birth removes sin nature that defiles a man and it places in him the mind of Christ so the born-again man walks by faith and not by sight now that scripture right now you know brother Branham taught it this way when God made a man he said God chose his heart but he said the devil took his head now so again every time that God comes to redeem he comes to the heart amen to change the heart not just your thinking but your heart now so again he says he says God chose his heart and the devil took his head the devil through imagination makes him imagine anything and gives him intellectual conceptions of the scripture so now makes him imagine anything plus on the religious side distorts the scriptures to where it's only an intellectual thinking it's not a work within the heart I'd like to turn to something 92 and 5 and let's just see this scripture because it says O Lord how great are thy works and thy thoughts are very deep hallelujah amen how greater that works and our thoughts are very deep a brutish man knoweth not neither does a fool understand this so again another translation says the spiritually insensitive do not recognize this the fool does not understand this and of course you know in sums fourteen and one it is the fool that is said in his heart there is no God and they are corrupt and they have done abominable works and there is none that doeth good here's good here's the condition of the depravity of man and man and a lost condition he says they are corrupt they have done abominable works there is none that doeth good the Lord look at them from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand and seek God and there are they are all gone aside they are all together become filthy and there is none that doeth good no not one this is condition of sinful man that's why you have to be born again to see or understand the kingdom of God because his thoughts are very deep and the wicked cannot understand it those that are born again will never understand the kingdom of God unless you're born again hey man now so you see those there again God gets in his heart and leads him by the spirit and makes him believe things that his intellectual knows nothing about because the message cannot be passed on intellectually and the new birth cannot happen intellectually it must be a change on the inside of the inside now when you were saved brother Branham said God gives you faith to rise above the muck of the earth your faith overcomes the things of the world what is your faith your faith is that act that God has did in you to make you a son of God you quit your line you quit your stealing you quit your drinkin because faith rises you up above it hey man if you don't do it you don't have any faith and Faithie are you Sade and that's our grace and as much as your faith will be released that's not how much power you have because in you dwells the power to make heavens and earth God dwells in you and your sons and daughters of God in man there you are but it's your faith jesus said according your faith be it unto you if thou canst believe all things are possible verily I say to you if you say to this mountain be thou removed and don't doubt but believe what you said so now when God made man he made this little compartment in the man for his own throne now you and I who never could take a microscope and really find it right neither can you find your spirit or the breaths of your life and when it leaves you can't see it when it goes and the same thing with the soul of man is something that is not is not tangible or are able to be see or taste or feel or hear or reach by the five senses it is something that though that is real that is on the inside of you it's a consciousness and and God made this for his throne this is to be the tower the control tower through which he operates and controls your all your thinking your movements your your beliefs everything is to be done where God that leads the man busy man wants to lead itself and so there is a war that goes on constantly men wants to go after what he sees with his eyes now I'm again if I told you you got to look beyond you got to see beyond what you are seeing a man but man wants to go after what he sees with his eyes and that's where he's to see that's where Satan to see d-word by what she could see the fruit was pleasant to the eyes a man but it was death to the soul and when man followed his own way getting off on his own leading is what separates him from fellowship with God when he started looking with what he could see by his eyes now this is still a problem today we're we're seeing things through the eyes of man many times you're you're looking at situations you're looking if your problems and you're looking there with just human eyes and you're gonna have to see beyond what you're seeing now door to the heart brother rather than shared with us that he said you're given five senses and then he says then five senses your intellectuals was never given you to Legion but the sixth sense was which his faith was given to you to lead you and that sixth sense is a super sense it is to lead you and he says notice he says these senses was given to you only to contact your earthly home but that you might see taste and feel smelling here but they weren't no by no means to lead you you see folks dr. neva today has bound up the spiritual eyes of the church for generations brother Branham would use that example he said what have you bound up the eyes of a people for generation after generation after generation he said after a while they would be born blind and he said the same thing will happen with the church if you've got generation after generation after generation you know bind up the eyes of the church where they are not seeing with spiritual eyes are you with me then you're gonna have children that are born in the church who that are blind and they cannot see what God is doing and man and brother madam said that's what the church has done to the sixth sense that God put in him he plays he has just placed faith off in miracles and signs and then the things that that contacts God gives him the Holy Ghost and things at his place are back there and back off somewhere else until it's the thing has become dead that's right he don't know how to use it there's just nothing to him you said well God is a healer for what about that God is a healer if he ever was a healer he's still a healer if he ever was a Savior he's still a savior if he ever was God he's still God but you see you've said a lack of faith that has been preached into the people a man that makes them left that sixth sense which is faith than a doormat I don't want to be guilty of that as a preacher hey man I don't want to be guilty of binding up the eyes of the church remember that they only have the memories of God in the past and they cannot see what spiritual eyes Christ among us a Living God how many are you this morning say I want to see a living God that's who I want to serve is a God that lives now again you know you go back to the days of Abraham and Abraham when hope was gone he believed he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in the faith giving glory to God and to do this he could not look at since knowledge now we will be talking about that this morning since knowledge and I want you to understand it's a terminology that brother Branham used several times throughout as a message but it's called since knowledge we know by our senses we're going by what we see what we hear what we feel now brother Branham said God called Abraham and separated him and the only thing he had to do or the only thing you had to believe was God's Word faith comes by hearing and all reason and since knowledge had to pass away and he had the and exactly Oh what the sent the Lord look Abraham was 75 his wife Sarah was 65 and he was going to give him a child by Sarah and Abraham couldn't say now let me see now if there's such a way let me go down and ask the doctor if Sarah could renew her strength what he couldn't reason it out but he based his faith Oh thus saith the Lord is that right I mean that's the way it's always been down through the ages Noah couldn't see the rain coming but he had a word from God and he looked beyond what he can see and he can see judgment coming come on a man and we you we today you can look beyond what you see and you know that fire is about to power we're living in an evil day are you with me now but we're basing our faith I'll dust saith the Lord now again brother Branham said this in expectation where he uses this terminology again he said all Christians most all Christianity and the way we see it today is so shallow it's like bubble dancing you speak of the spirit and know little of it that's right you don't get down and deal with the actual facts of it you see that's the reason that the illusions today just know from a word standpoint they approach it like that with a sense knowledge and know nothing about the indwelling Spirit and the power they don't deal with spirit they just look at and say well I believe it's this and you draw your own conception and that's the reason they make fatal mistakes I don't want to be a shallow Christian again he would talk about this using this term and he said now if you look at live when you hear the gospel preached on the basis of the word that settles it your heel right there but you cannot be healed by Middle's you got to be healed by real living faith from your heart no matter how much you've worked up here and no matter how much you just believe up here if something down in here tells you it's over it's over that settles it there's no more fear nobody can tell you any different you don't know why you believe it it's not reason it's faith you just believe it and that's the way it takes place you believe it and go on no matter what your sense knowledge would say and it'd be out I'll be all out of reason it was out of reason for Abraham and Sarah to have a baby but they believed it anyhow and it's all out of reason for a man to stay alive in the belly of a well but he did anyhow amen it's all out of reason for a man to raise one from the dead but he did it anyhow a man yes it's true it's not reason it's faith right hey man that's why we need revelation I'm coming back to that remember we entered we ended on the need for revelation and how we should pray for revelation more than anything you'll read that quote again and in a moment but listen we need revelation we want certain things to happen but what is God's mind about it what does God will done you see Adam was in the image of God and my faith Adam had dominion over the world by faith he just the garden but faith he controlled the animals upon the earth when the fall came his faith dwarfed and his senses began to lead him now he was no longer operating by faith he would be operating by the sweat of his brow what he can see taste fell feeling here with his own strength to move a tree it would now take an axe and lots of sweat hey ma'am I meant to control the animal would mean to kill the Beast to subdue him in some way in some different ways by using the intellects of man no longer could he control their earth by faith because sin came in the picture a man now what God is want to do is resurrect us back to faith again and my word we are controlling things in an atmosphere of faith bringing come now Jesus did it with a word he cast out devils made the sickness leave with the word and my faith in the word made devils tremble is that right amen phase in the word go that allows us for dead days dead from the grave faith made him to walk on the waters faith calls him to speak to a trajan sea and the whole sea became quiet that right he did it by word the second Adam now this is the reason we're pointing to Jesus is because he's the first of the new race and man and every son of God's can be born in His image every newborn child and man would be born in His image because time baguettes kind species we get species so if Jesus gives birth to sons he's gonna have sons just like him is that right amen now again again brother Branham said that God gave you the five census as a gift and it depends on what you yield these senses to will be the way your life is controlled the way you yield those five senses what you see what you hear what you taste smile feel whatever those sensors are yielded to they will dominate you now already you know many of you have been listening to the news and it's been dominating a man has been dominating your thinking even dominating your attitudes some of you dominated your passions such as anger come on because you are looking at what you see instead of looking in the eyes of the word of God and what God's mind is about it hey man come on now hey man we're we're grateful that God gave us the five senses but they were not giving you to lead you and man they were giving you just for earthly contact Amen there was a sixth sense that Long's only to the Christian how many are Christian then you got a sixth sense and man then and that's the only way that you can have more than six inches five senses for the natural person is to be a Christian and that that is faith is the one that is to govern and to guide you and it's superior to what you're seeing taste and smell and feeling or hearing now don't mean the other senses are no good but they were not given to you to lead you amen the five senses are contrary to the Word of God their life amen but the sixth sense cannot lie a man it's a super since then we're gonna get into it if I get the time today this variety is a super race she has a super sense she is a mind of Christ hey man the super sense is the Holy Spirit and when the faith of God that dwells in you so if you have the Holy Spirit you have faith within you hey man now and that that is so if you can let the five senses now be yielded to the sixth sense it will guide you and bring all the other five senses under control of their super sense it's so far beyond and above the natural sense as the spirits of man is above the natural as far as the heaven is above the natural man and his five senses it makes you believe things that you cannot see now it makes you act where you do not think that five senses would ever think about it the devil can get in these five senses and lie to you but he can't touch the super sense that is far beyond its reach that come from God it's called faith and faith is that great thing now and the five senses do not control the sixth sense but the six is controls the five senses and madness super-sis controls the natural senses and the five senses are seat eight smell feeling here and the super sense is something that'll make you believe God's Word but that's the only thing it will speak about a man so the super sense only looks at God's Word what does God say about this hey ma'am now and it'll make you believe things for me four things that you can't see that are totally unreasonable a man that that are contrary to your feeling somebody with me I mean even contrary to what you're hearing from the doctor the world or wherever you're getting your information from amen and it'll deliver that word to you and make you walk contrary to any other thing there is but God's Word that's what faith will do now so again we but when when we when we're born the only thing we know about is just in our intellectual thinking we think is a man we see as a man we understand the man we hear as a man but when we become born again we are gloving or regenerated and born again and when that happens the sixth sense takes ahold of us and doing so that super sense raises you up to a spot word that you cannot bake to believe things that you could not hear things you could not see understandings you could not understand and you believe it in how because you're governed by the sixth sense the super sense hallelujah hey ma'am so that five senses were you know that that super sense is to make your five senses deny everything that's a contrary to God's Word so you look at something and you say well I see this but the super sense will make you deny what you're seeing I heard the doctors say this but the super sense will make you deny what the doctor said and now man your feelings say you can't overcome that cigarette habit or that doper that stuff that you've been on and yet but the super sense says I can overcome it I can rise up above this high mountain now so the super sense doesn't see all of that at all it means when David what David looked at the Goliath he looked at it with the super sense and he says you you know who are you to defy your uncircumcised you're out of the covenant got it on your side and who are you to defy the armies of the Living God a man and he saw him as nothing and he saw his God has everything hey man now so you walk by the city to suit the the sixth sense you talk by that Cygnus six things what was David doing today I cut your head off what was he doing he didn't have a sword but he was talking by the super sense a man he was proclaiming things he could not see to be already so hey ma'am so you you walk by that sixth sense you talk by that sixth sense you even died by that sixth sense these all died in faith a man you rise by that super sense a man because it's something in you that is different than what's in the natural man now you know you know I have an organ here that brother Jerry Roncalli is having trouble with today his eyes God I'm asking you to touch that right now in Jesus name how many agree with me we can believe hey man I've got a I got an organ called an eye to which I can see I've got an organ called in here through which I can hear hey man I have an organ here some of you thinks it's a big one a mountain about which I can smell but faith is the organ which enables people to see the invisible order now and when you're born again God puts dis give you so that you can believe things that the natural mind could never believe and see things that the natural mind could never our natural I could never see I mean look a look with Moses when he stood there and he looks at his choices a poor people or favor of strong a man and he looked beyond what he could see because he saw the richest nation and the grave me and the greatest general and the greatest army and he saw them defeated and this little bitty nation of slaves being liberated and going to a new land [Music] he looked with a different eye then what he could see that's what I'm that's what I'm trying to tell sometimes you young people you gotta look at things with a different eye than what you're seeing you see what popularity as you see what makes you socially acceptable you see what the world wants you to be like you gotta look beyond that and see the spirit behind it hey man see the spirit behind it I'm in here a lot of times you you don't look at that but you know a bit but the spirit behind is the spirit of rebellion a man a spirit that will will make you not to be unsub ejected subjected to the word hour or as a woman to her husband or whatever it is it'll be the house spirit there you gotta look beyond what you're just seeing now so this is this is why that things happen let me just read some of this that natural man only has these five senses they're all right as long as it can be brought in submission to the sixth sense if the natural mind reads or to God and said that sort of God is speaking the truth but if it reads it and it says it's not all the Word of God or it was one time but it isn't now then that six cents come in and say but he's the same yesterday today and forever that's the difference that's why so many people fail to be healed they are trying to come with an intellectual conception and they say oh I do this and I believe this and so forth but if that sixth sense is saying that then there is nothing that will shake them from that sixth sense sixth sense denies all symptoms a man anything that contrary the word of God's word any feeling any emotion Amen somebody said well I prayed for but I just don't feel any better and then the sixth sense will never stand for that the success will say that's a lie Amen because my feelings are not saying what God's Word said and today I'm agreeing with what God's Word said no matter what my feelings are saying they're not yet in accordance with what God's Word said success won't stand for that it'll say it's a line I'm getting well God said so that settles it God said so the success only feeds on the Word of God that's super sense it's super it's about all the other senses it's greater sense it's of faith it's a power that stirs and drives it's something that makes you do things you never thought you would do if the sixth sense of super sense you get prayed for say you got a crippled hand and you get prayed for in your hand you come up there and you believe God's gonna hear you in the prayer the pastor prays for you you go back the old natural man will say this you don't feel any better or any different in that hand you're no better than what you ever was but if the sixth sense comes along and said that's a lie you've been prayed for that settles it hey man you know you're going to be healed it may not happen today it may not happen tomorrow come on something yeah we we want miracles The Healing is not a miracle even John Rhines healing was not a miracle he was blind amen it was blind and brother Branham tells him in the prayer line you know you're healed he goes back off walks off the platform as blind as ever and then he says you know he gets to talking with somebody in the back and said that man said I was healed I don't understand I can't see and he gets him back in the line again and he says he said what are you doing back in the line you're healed he said well I can't see he said that doesn't have nothing to do with it he said you said you believe me he said well I do you told me things I don't know that nobody else knew you told in secrets of my heart yes I have to believe you what must I do didn't you go off testifying thank God for healing me Amen because what you see he had to hold on to that promise even though thus saith the Lord had come same way with you you get a word from God you don't give up on it you keep holding on to that promise hey man if God gave you a promise hold on to it hey man take out take a grip of it now God wants to leave me so he puts him a control tower in the midst of his heart so a man can be led by the Spirit of God but the scripture said sons of God and daughters of God are led by the Spirit of God and a man it didn't say you are led by your five senses what you can see taste smell feeling hear sake you're led by the Spirit yes for some your emotions is your control tower and you can notice a man or a woman they transferred walk after the things of the world they can never please God you know why they're going by their motions oh isn't that cute oh isn't that wouldn't I look like a doll like that oh you know just to fit in you're going you're ruled by your emotions mmm but a man or a woman that will not look at the things the world but just go according to the leading of the Spirit and let me just tell you this fear will only direct you to the word a man you know dead then there's were the great fighters today Satan took the eye a man's head that control him by his head and got to his heart so just remember even as a believer you're saved and you got faith in your heart but Satan will try to anoint your senses to believe things that is contrary to the Word of God this is why you know it doesn't cancel out your salvation it just simply keeps you from having your healing and your deliverance let me say God helped me to keep my eyes on you brother Branham said even then he said that's he said a man's always trying to achieve something by his head he's supposed to achieve but thighs heart and that's the control tower where God controls him and directs his thoughts and drex's walk directs his emotion what's now he said sometimes I get happy I get so happy I just have to let it loose and if I look around and see somebody and then I get my eyes on people then that means ever done that it mean you feel the Holy Spirit and go to moving man you just feel such joy in your heart you just want to let it loose but you're afraid of what everybody else thinks amen amen he says I got my eyes on people then he said God came to help me to keep my eyes closed I want to be led by the Spirit of God not that the flesh will have nothing to do into it so that's what we do we quench the spirit a man to please the flesh usually set ministers get in the pulpit they begin to think if I speak on a certain certain thing here's a certain member of my church that is a good payer in this church they'll leave the church and then you I'll go to looking at the bless again then God can't lead that spirit you've got to say what the Spirit says to say then we are led by the Spirit of God how many wants the Spirit led minister a mad now your self subconscious is your soul and you usually move by your subconscious and and that's the reason with preachers today they don't believe in divine healing and they won't preach it because salvation has never come down in the heart it's only in their head hello the sub-conscience is a control center the control center is what you are it moves you you live by in this either of God or Satan if you're born again if you're born again the Holy Spirit abides there within the soul controlling your life revealing his will to you and remember the Bible's always his will if not Satan abides there and you have nothing to believe with now so you have as it word to consciousness you've got a mind the intellect where your memory your imagination your reason your affection your conscience your sense of right and wrong and so one is there and people try to look at their intellect for faith when faith doesn't lay their reasons lay there but they've lays in the soul and that's why Jesus said if you say to this mountain and be thou removed and be thou counseling to see and don't doubt in your heart remember believe that those things which he says have come to pass he will have whatsoever he said it has to be something you believe from the heart in other words it's a revelation of faith now again romans 10 and 9 we went through the scripture last week but just want to touch it briefly that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart notice here where you have to believe in the heart that God has raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved but with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation deliverance so you see many people believe this in their mind but the word don't perform for them and it's because they don't believe it from the heart it's got to be something revealed to you now the sub-conscience is where you live let me just go through some of these statements real quick the sub-conscience is where you live that's a reason for people it's hard for them to have faith up here they say yes I got faith but something down here says but it's not for you this fellow up here says I believe God heals and I believe he's the same yesterday today and forever but the subconscious says but it's not for you the conscience of the mind says and I'm quoting brother Branham oh brother Branham I got all faiths and he said they believe that in sincerity but down on the inside in the subconscious place lays a place called the soul and this in Alexa mind does not govern the vibration of the system the mind is only a director it will direct you and it's very incapable of bringing you to God your mind and you cannot know God by your mind the intellectual it's one of the resources or channels that will lead you to it but your soul is what governs you you are what you are by yourself again you know and I wonder you share this dealing with the subconscious and then we'll go on but brother branham had several things to say and bear with me as I just share it with you but I think it's important that we just lay these things out as we get into this he says now there's a reason that people doesn't get the healing and the blessings that sometimes they so reverently asked for you woke up in perhaps 90% 99% of out of every 100 in here tonight do you believe Jesus Christ can heal you yes and without a shadow of a doubt they believe that well then Jesus said if you believe it you shall receive it but that's just a conscience believe in it now you've got a subconscious that's gotta act - so you're believing it from up here hey ma'am oh yeah I believe that yeah I believe that story yeah I believe it Jonah really got some a little swollen by well I really believe of the Red Sea opened up and it was a deep sea and then and there was a pop me yeah I really believe Jesus rose from the dead but you're doing it here it's never here because down in here something's governed you out here directing you contrary to the word and you know that cannot be right he said it's like a man crossing the sea when you go into the ship the man runs to this the ship the man who runs his ship or guides it sets up here in the pilothouse the man that really runs his hip goes down the bowels of the ship down into the hole of it he's the engineer no matter how much this guy here says this guy that does the work that's your subconscious this is your your first conscience now if this fellow here receives an order from the mate or whoever it is what he's about to do he passes on down he guides his ship but this man has to do with the the running of it no matter how much he does the guiding it won't do a bit of good until you got some steam down here are some pressure pulling it now for what if he sets an order down two knots to the left and this man turns two knots to the right won't do no good which way he turns it here you see you're going around and around in the harbor you'll never get out well that's the conscience and the subconscious this fellow here he believes all right but this won't cooperate with him a man now the reason it would don't cooperate when you get here to get prayed for each night I'd say to lay your hands on each other believe with all your heart and you shall receive what you ask for God comes around and confirms exists exactly what is said the truth of his presence being here and there's not a mortal mentally right but with no but what that's the truth and yes you say I believe it and the next night you're right back in the prayer line again see it shows that there's a little fear down here yes I believe it but is it really for me and that's the subconscious saying that now if the subconscious and this conscience will agree perfectly together then when an order comes I am the Lord that healeth thee right here and that I am the lord that healeth thee and the sub-conscience says he's the Lord that healeth me to chipper go out to sea there you are is got to be an agreement God first conscience second conscience and then and then our subconscious and then there's not a shadow of a doubt no matter if it's the next day you as twice as sick as you was when you come to church that night you're healed anyhow you're just healed any out there's nothing can take you out of it it's going to be done because you've accepted it there's something anchored in there there's far beyond sight any physical and mental thing that you can have any of the senses would never declare it like faith and a lot of people are going on since knowledge of how what they still see or what they still feel instead of what the Word of God said a man now but when they come in perfect agreement that's when you're gonna move towards your healing your deliverance are you with me now again you you see you can believe it up here he says let me just say it they believe it up here but don't down here and this this here will overrule because the sub-conscience will move on you'll try to walk out with a middle conception glory to God him he'll praise the Lord I'm here and write down saying it isn't so it's not a revelation here and he said and finally this rules this full rule stopped right away and with these symptoms and why rights than you just say well I just didn't get it and that's without the conscience of the mind has to be an agreement with the conscience of the soul and they must both be in agreement with the world hey man and that's when healing will take place when you can get the mind and the heart together agreeing with the word then you'll be healed all right now that's why you need to pray for to God for revelation more than anything you got a need in your life start praying to God for revelation so lord I need a revelation on this I need it quick into my heart many of you know if you're you're unsaved it got to give you a revelation of salvation you sure will amen but again it's got to be from the heart a man is what he is was he believes from the heart therefore if a man or a woman could ever get their thoughts and their testimony and their lives lined up with God until the channel of the Holy Spirit would be perfectly one with God what would take place if the man and the woman could ever get lined up where the freedom from their hearts with faith from their innermost most people come the altar to be prayed for they have been Alexa faith they confess their sins and join the church by intellectual faith they believe it in their mind they believe it cuz they've heard it they believe it cuz they know it's the best policy but it's not what God looks at he don't look at your intellectual faith he looks on the heart we're on the inside when it comes in the heart all things are possible then your confession meets up with your life and your life speaks as loud as your confession does and then when your confession says one thing and your life says another there's something wrong somewhere that's because you have an intellectual faith and not a faith from your heart and that shows that out here is a knowledge of God but inside here is a demon of doubting I believe in divine healing but it's not for me and he'll try to anoint you even those who you that are born-again I just just somehow won't work for me I know God does this but it's not for me it won't happen for me it happened oh if I could get and you're going by sense knowledge instead of walking by faith now again again you say well what about for my lost loved ones how does this work how does this apply for my lost loved ones I mean he's got lost loved ones you ones he saved alright let's just look at this you know you know our days the people of God started signing crying for the abominations that are done in the city if we start signing crying for what's going on in our neighborhoods in our world even what's going on in our church in our families and you start making something a priority come on things would be different this little woman rub brother branham I don't I don't know who she was but he says he said I want to receive the Holy Ghost I want to know what to do I'm burdened for my family to be saved and he said if you want to receive the Holy Ghost let me tell you something dear sister the Bible said blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness you're so blessed to even want it now remember not that you got it but you're blessed are they that hunger and thirst for it for they shall be filled just stay right with it what must I do for my family use the same faith that you're using for yourself for your family commit them to the Lord and believe with all your heart that you're going to be saved and don't just let it come on your natural thinking here but let it drop way down on the inside that subconscious did they're yours gods give them to you when you got it down here I meant so there's one thing that you need to be praying about you need to be praying about Revelation and say God let it drop from up here down to here so that I can believe for my children for my loved one but my needs my husband my situation let it drop from up here to down here amen whatever you have in your heart here ask for it and when you pray you believe that you receive what you ask for you don't doubt it no more you can't believe it and doubt it at the same time hey man how many knows that you can't believe and doubt at the same time you've got to believe that what you ask for you receive it then he said it would be given to you so you believe for your family and they'll get it hey man wasn't you why don't you right now start just calling itself not what you see just uh calling itself I mean God you gave me that child God you gave me that son you gave me that daughter you gave me a husband you gave me a wife you gave me this and I'm calling it so a man I'm invoking that promise hey man I'm gonna start preparing for that promise to be manifested are you with me what about divine healing brother branham said here he said I he said I want to believe believes in divine healing every one of yous you said sure brother branham I believe in divine healing now you maybe you mean that with the intelligence you know how to speak you believe it that's in your head but remember there's a subconscious down here that's got to say the same thing it David doesn't you'll never get nowhere you might read the Bible what brother branham here the bible says is and that's exactly right and that's what people today well I believe Jesus Christ the Son of God well how do you know he's the son of God the Bible said so well how do you know he's the son of God mother said so the breacher said so and they might be right but how do you know and the Bible said you cannot know until you receive the Holy Ghost you're only taking somebody else's word did you know that that doesn't do very good and but that's the truth quote it no man can say Jesus is of Christ's only by the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost seen you has to bear record to the resurrection and Jesus being the Son of God and you're only t.r you're only taking what somebody else's words are said for it you're only taking what the Bible says the Bible's right or you're taking what the minister says the ministers right or some good person said and they're right but you as an individual don't know that Jesus is a Christ until the Holy Ghost is brought into you and notice no man can have faith for healing until it's revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he's going to get well now you're gonna need revelation and to get revelation means that you've got to get the thinking of Christ about the matter now it's the same as a personal revelation for salvation now help me now just for bit brother brother Kaylin is probably listening in today from South Africa he's a pastor there and he and I were fellowshiping and he shared with me the definition of faith he found the wikibooks god bless you brother Kaylin in the group there with you in the Greek the word which we get faith denounce it the noun is pistis and believe the verb is P still faith means belief firm persuasion assurance firm conviction faithfulness faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance that the Lord is working remember even when you don't see it he's working amen so even though we cannot see it faith knows that no matter what the situation in our lives or someone else's that the Lord is working in it a man it is the act whereby a person lays hold on God's resources becomes obedient to what he has prescribed and putting aside all self interests and self-reliance trust him completely it is an unqualified surrender of the whole of one's beings in dependence upon him it is holy trusting and relying upon him for all things it is not just middle ascent to the facts and realities of truth it must come from a deep inner conviction demons also believe as what James children and 19 said demons believe in shudder but they do not experience faith hey ma'am faith is a divine revelation say it again faith is a divine revelation faith comes from God it is a gift from God we're going to talk about it this word piece DS means it's called faith it's always a gift from God is never something that can reproduce my people it is phases for the believers God's divine persuasion God persuaded Gideon God persuaded Noah by God's persuasion even what with God and was not but by God's persuasion a abraham believed for a baby so faith is god's persuasion a man therefore is distinct from human belief our human confidence yet it involves that the Lord continuously bursts faith in the yielded believer continually birthing faith so they can know what the persuasion of his will is what is your will in the matter I'm brother Branham daughters you know something that was shocking to the Pentecostal world that God does not heal all now that's different than what the divine healers preached even the charismatic around preaches that God heals all God does not heal all Jesus went into a place and then he walked right in he went left his reason his sights his thinking and everything else walked right down to a man who had been laying there for 38 years and healed him and left the rest of him laying there and brother Branham told us it peace said you pretty costal people it's a lie that there's gonna be a time that we're gonna go in there and empty out the hospital it has never been done and it never will be done healing is when we can find the will of God and that's where church is gonna be where they seek the will of God and this is the fault of why we're not seeing more healer is because we're not seeking the will of God in the matter where it hadn't been looking for Revelation now God wants to continually birth faith within you anytime brother Branham said anything that God can lead your soul to believe that's yours anything that God can lead your soul to believe that's yours now that's why he said you've got all the power in you but it's controlled by law of faith and man and he said the law of faith it that opens it to you if you can just find the key and that key is Revelation God said so and when you can get now saith the Lord and thus saith the Lord can still come to his church it can still come to his church oh man I mean it doesn't take a prophet you can receive that saith the Lord that God can speak to you as an individual [Music] sons have gotten let by the Spirit of God how are you left by dust at the Lord God dealing with your spirit come up where to be spiritual people spirit let people we put ourself on autopilot although you know first to many years it's time do we got to realize we gotta buckle down really become sincere believers people doesn't pray people didn't seek the mind of God people are not Lord give me the key to that hey ma'am brother branham said as much as your faith will be released that's how much power you can have now let me stop for a minute we look over at brother Branham and we just see him my having this supreme power but I'm gonna say to you God showed us the power that laid in the word squirrels have spoken to existence three times somebody help me is that right a man he wasn't a and but the speaking of the squirrels was never brother branham's idea it wasn't him out there saying you know and entertaining people and saying okay girl you know let's have some squirrels today I need three of them let one come here one come there God told him to do that and he was showing what the mind of God could do when a man of God could yield to it let me just say it again you know when he went to Hattie Wright's house after that it was not brother branham's idea to give her what she wanted the Prophet sent a super anointing come upon me I'm super anointed and the Holy Spirit came down and what happened when she was telling all I know it could be was too oh but I referred squirrels Sapir out of nowhere and has to be Jehovah Jireh showing he's the same God still operating in men come on a man and what happened any right said there's nothing but the truth and it moved God I want you to know even in a service like this you can move God to speak on your behalf and it has to do with your attitude toward that promise oh man and faith dropped in that little woman's heart there is nothing but the truth he said give her what she asked for and she wanted the salvation of her children wasn't brother Brandon's idea when he spoke to storm he was an out there popping off shilling his power you know this way where people want to be today they want to be super super beings and a super man and speak to this storm and speak to that storm it you know God told him hey man when he spoke to the tumor in his wife's body that disappeared a thousand eleven twelve hundred miles away from Jeffersonville to Tucson his wife in Tucson him and his home in Jeffersonville kneeling down and praying and God says ask what you will what was it it was the mind of God faith is given by inspiration it is the revelation of the mind of God improving his word brother Brennan said you can only have faith as God gives you faith faith is a gift of God now it works his faith expressed I was probably there at this service don't remember it but you know I remember the wings of us know I dove but this one brother branham said now faith is a revelation from God faith is a revelation that's why I want to stay just for a woman it's a revelation he's revealed it to you by His grace it's nothing you did you didn't work yourself up into faith you ever have faith it's given to you by the grace of God and God reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation and the whole church is built on Revelation a man now faith is always received from God it's never generated by us faith is only exclusively given to the redeem it is not a virtue that can be worked up by human effort hey man you can't deserve faith can't work for faith you can't live as a Christian long enough to be worthy of faith faith is a gift of God and my faith always comes from God and involves his revelation therefore faith is beyond belief and mine faith is God's work faith is never the work of people we cannot produce faith ourselves nor can we drum it up and we'll remember faith comes as Christ speaks the word within us that's what faith cometh by here and he said here in this hot faith it is received by hearing so we hear the word and we start believing because God gives us faith are you with me now faith brother Branham said people look to their intellect I'm there for faith when faith doesn't later the reasons later faith lays in the soul again I want you to do two quote to you from John 5 and 4 whatsoever is born of God conquers the world and this is a conquest he conquered the world our faith a man faith is a persuasion from God that we received as he grants impulse in other words a divine spark a mad you you've got the word in you that's why it's important to get the word in there but it takes that spark of faith to ignite it to make it explode and to make it work and my faith is always the work of God and involves hearing his voice a man whenever the believer lays a hold of his preferred wheel now think of this faith is always the work of God and involves hearing his voice this is why it's important that you seek the voice of God this is why it's important you seek for God's leadership what do you want done about this come on amen faith is when the word is quicken or made alive to you brother Branham said and I promise you I would read this again no man knows the things that God saved this fear of God they he to whom the Spirit of God reveals them we need to call on God for revelation more than anything else in the world faith is to be contended for come on Jude 3 said that we should earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints we must contend for faith I'm trying to get something to the church it's not yes it's a gift of God but is something you contend for it's something you seek the voice of God for and to do that you've got a yield to God you got a surrender to God you got all you need listen listen I know we're we're not praying enough we're not talking to God enough we're not seeking his mind enough we don't got involved in everything else of the world where our mind is on the news and what's going on out there and I want you to start seeing but what you are seeing come on amen you seeing this turmoil out here but what's God doing in all of this Amen we've seen a COBIT night team but what stop doing in all of this where is this angel where is this presence where is the Holy Ghost a man you're looking at sir cancer you're looking at your situation or your sickness or or your asthma or whatever it is you know you're looking at that you're looking our baddest but we're gonna see beyond what you are seeing we've accepted the Bible we've accepted the great truths of it but it's still not real to most people quoting your prophet because a revelation by the spirit is not there the word has not been quickened now brother Branham told us we had done we have already put too much emphasis on the mechanics and not enough on the dynamics and this whole message community is guilty of that that's right Charles price it was when the early Pentecostal fathers but he said we have made faith a condition of mind when it is divinely it is a divinely imparted grace of the heart we can only receive faith as he gives it you cannot manufacture faith and you cannot work it up brother Branham told them it told him many times the Pentecostals were especially bad about this coming into the line you know and then they would feel the presence of God the angel and they'd go to shouting and screaming and yelling and speaking in tongues and dancing around and shaking themselves and no God hallelujah amen glory to God and brother Brent said don't do that you interfere with faith there you interfere with God come up reverently and lay your hand up and believe faith you don't work yourself up to it faith is something that's already in your heart you just come and believe so it isn't something you scream down from heaven this is a lot of problems sometimes even with our youth camp you know you you know instead of yielding to the spirit instead and yes I know you yield to where you shout but let me come on your yield to him until you get something to shout about hey man sometimes you rob yourself from the blessing that you really ought to got from the real change that takes place on the heart a man Charles frights would say again you can believe a promise and at the same time not have the faith to appropriate it genuine scriptural faith is not our ability to count it done it is the deep consciousness divinely imparted to the heart of man that it is done it is the faith that only God can give do not struggle in the power of the wheel what a mistake to take our belief in God and call it faith Christ the Living Word is our sufficiency what is faith now let me just take it for a little longer the blocks busy so am i yeah so what is faith there was another Christian writer explaining faith like this faith is giving substance for what is hope for faith is the grasping of under militant realities of hope and bringing them into the realm of reality and he said faith grows out of the Word of God it is the warranty deed that the thing for which you have fondly hoped for is that last yours it is the evidence of things not seen your hope for finances to meet that obligation faith gives assurance that you'll have the money when you need it you hope for physical strength to do the work that you know you must do faith says God is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid since knowledge have give to the church mental assent which looks so much like faith that that many people cannot see that efforts mental assent is seeing it at mine it and saying is true but not in my case minimal sip agrees that the Bible is a revelation that it came from God and ever word is true yet when the crisis comes it does not work it simply recognizes the truthfulness of that wonderful book but does not act upon it hope says I will get it sometime faith says I have it now middle Asim says it's beautiful I know I should have it for some reason I don't get it I cannot understand it since knowledge says when I see it or when I feel it I don't know a habit real faith and the word says if God said it's true idiots if he says by His stripes I'm healed I am if God says he will supply ever need of mine he will do it if he says I am the strength of your life he is a meant so I go about doing my work because he is what he says he is and I am what he says I am a man I if he says I am strong I am if he says I am healed I am if he says he cares for me I know he does and my real faith is built on the word faith since the results of the word dwelling in us he says I don't mean the word committed to memory I mean the word live practice until it becomes a part of it we meditated upon it we think deeply on it we feed upon it and the word becomes a very part of ourselves this word of faith builds us into confidence and assurance so let's just mind being you God condescended to become a man for the purpose of redemption and he humbled himself to the will and the word of the Father he left his god ship to become a man and he's asking you to put off your humanity your old man what you're seeing taste and smell and feeling here and realize your sonship receiving the renewed mind surrendering your own thinking to a higher thinking to be able to think God's thoughts of yourself and sons of God operating with his mind that's what God wants to do with his people and when you have been called in the message the bride is a little faith woman a woman of faith a man brother Branham said when a man lives by faith and walks by faith he said I mean sets in faith he is isolated from the entire world becomes a new creature in Christ there now you're getting the bride material you're getting a rapture in condition now a man he says he said that means so much to us he said not just for the pastor the Deacons a trustee means for the lady every individual walks in the world with God alone you're baptized in his kingdom there's nobody in there but you and God he gives you the orders and you pack them out whatever he says there's no sign of it out nowhere you walk right on a man if the Lord says this there's no one in the world can talk you out of it you're going to see you're gonna write the same you come into the perfect paper perfect perfection that cannot fail that faith never fails a man as we said if he's coming he's coming and bringing forth of his own kind let me just share this the church the true bride that church or church bride comes to the headstone will be a super Church Oh super race as she nears that great headstone there'll be so much like him to there be in his very image in order to be united with him they will be one they will be the manifestation of the word of the Living God I want you to know this was something that was put on the proper sphere to write about you this is thus saith the Lord about what you will be a super race of super jerks as you near that great head so and we're closer now than we've ever been hey man this is a prophecy of the bride I wonder who is willing to who do who is willing to to go from questioning how can these things be to be it unto me according I word a man that brought that disrupt Mary from Berenice to be impregnable spirit and that's the only thing that will bring a parent Church filled with life is what weeks quick question inhale and start accepting the promise for ourselves amen we are to express his mind because we have his mind we have eternal life that's God's own life brother Brennan said you received it like it was on the day of pinnacles and he said and through this the mind of Christ should be operating among us this brings us in a harmony with the word amen were we in Christ becomes one let me just skip on down to some things as we try to get there get here because I want you to understand the mind of Christ is to be in the bride as it was in the groom a man these these are these are apostolic times as brother Brennan said I'm trying to get the church into the place where we can really see apostolic times sometimes you wonder brother Jim why are you preaching this way because if it promised Amen because this is what God said a bride would be in the end time amen he said I'm training at the church to the place where we can really see apostolic times moving among us that's what we all hunger and it's laying right at the door I wonder he'll knock on that door no wonder who'll ask and keep on asking a man he said we see it and we have but we want to see more of it we want it to be such a flow that'd be a help to us and flow out to others hey man these let me just let me just clarify some things can I speak from my heart for a moment these apostolic times promise are not the repeat of the turmoil and the strife that was found in the book of Acts and Men those were the acts of called me the apostolic times promised for the results of the original vine putting forth another branch from itself and the Holy Spirit acting the believer as he did back then listen it's important how how we preach these things and the slant we're preaching them in because I'm going to tell you a lot of these things are not being preached with negativity instead of a positive gospel let me just read it to you from brother Branham this quote stuck out to me this week that is I come across it I was looking for the word unction because I want to unction of the Holy Ghost I'm looking for that impulse I want it for me I want it for you brother Branham said and it wasn't so from the beginning this was spoken three-port let's go back to the real first light the old Pentecostal blessing and the power of the Holy Ghost back in the church they put it all on the preacher today it ain't the preacher the Holy Ghost is just as much to the laity as it is in the preacher he ain't got all the religion they got it out there and I'm one today that believes we ought to get the Spirit of God back in the church what we can have the gifts of the Spirit in with unction and power but today we find men we're in the beginning of the church age I'm teaching all next week at my tavern Akal at home to write a little commentary as I my comments on it my own comments on it you notice it started as the deeds of the Nicolaitans and after a while it became a doctrine well what it is it taken all this period away from the congregation and made bishops and overseers and Pope's and put it all in the Pope head and the Pope had got intellectual there you got a hybrid Church again under intellectual God send us back the Holy Ghost amongst the people let the option of the spirit move among the people given forth messages and power and manifestation if we have to stand on the street corner or get in a chicken house or a barn somewhere we don't want any of this hybrid religion come out of the similar we want to come like a rushing mighty wind from all from on high that fills all the house not just one man but all the house were there seated perversion is what the man did in the days of the Lord Jesus that's what he's trying to do today take the things that are original and pervert them by his own ideas and he ruins his self what was that what came under day of Pentecost the same breath of God that breathed upon Adam and became a living soul the same Jesus that breathed on the disciples and their and their soul became alive with the Holy Ghost that breath of God became a wound and they're filled up with the Holy Ghost I'm saying that Jesus breathed on you today and fill you again with the spirit it can't be just an anointed man in the pulpit it's got to be anointed people in the pew it can't be just a man in the pulpit with dust saith the Lord it's got to be you with inspiration being led by the Holy Ghost being spoke to by the voice of God of people who know their God backs out new exploits are you with me a man I tell you we ought to say Lord Jesus breathed on me a man breathe on me and fill me again with the Holy Ghost is that right a man we you know the whole news has been filled I mean there's not an article there's nothing hardly said everything else is went on the back burner because a man said I can't breathe man George Floyd said this says he suffocated I can't breathe hey ma'am and I can't breathe as well as thought oh now a hundred thousand victims who happened to who have died of covin this Kovach 19 I can't breathe now that we got protestors out there today by the hundreds and millions where their posters saying I can't breathe countless men millions of Americans in the streets protesting police brutality I can't breathe let me tell you all scriptures are to be God Bree every Board of soul of God is God breathed and when you have a ministry come on now for many mouths or calls I can't breathe when you got him replace and the real Holy Ghost with easy believe ISM I can't breathe somebody's gotta sweat on the neck of this bride and when you gotta forbidding prayer lines and neglecting to sick wouldn't you have for people who can't breathe and when you put it all in the pulpit and it's not in the pews you gotta people who can't breathe but I say breathe breath of God freeze of me breathe into my life breathe into my heart breathe into my soul finally a free mason to me that was once delivered to the space be it my life let it change me in this presence I gotta have the breath of God the Holy Ghost Face working in the clerk's or otherwise I can't breathe [Applause] but happening say lord give me breasted now give me breath and then there may be somebody out there dying with cancer right now hit

brother wouldn't you rather have divine love and love like Jesus and be able to forgive our enemies and I'm the perfect word then signs and wonders and healings and miracles why father you say why do we have to choose and then we can have love we can have life we can have the power we're gonna have the signs and the wonders don't put your foot on my neck till I can't breathe what can we have both what can we have why do we have to forfeit the power of God to have the love of God amen to be able to forgive our enemies especially when that since the love of God is the Holy Ghost and it's only the Holy Ghost that can heal and do two miracles for Satan cannot cast out Satan and these signs shall follow them that believe let me breathe let me feel like that there's more to let me bring and man let me be able to breathe I know I want to close don't choke us to death I want you to say you preach us get to know you're put off the neck of this bride let her breathe better breathing them divine healing let her breathe in the Holy Ghost let her free them oppression on oh brother Tim don't you know there's anointed ones at the end time yeah oh [Applause] yeah and one that is an order

father that's his word of promise don't choke us to death hey man brother branham said I heard a spirit passed by me so can spirit I felt like it come back again I felt it come back again a few moments ago it was in a in a few moments it was a Kia Ora Auditorium I was fourteen thousand people in there and I said somebody with a quarter is just healed for a spirit just passed by here and I said frankly here it comes by again and as it passed by I heard it strangling and he said now that may almost drown for you some of you some but there was a reporter from the postal dispatch that was in the second balcony he had come to criticize the meeting and when he heard that he said it's me brother Bannon I'm healed I've had a hedwig order for years and years and he said but I'm healed now hallelujahs take them down nobody's so grumpy souls of men and souls of women team effort stone [Applause] we have the mind of Christ and the mind of Christ said we don't put up with that stand there pastoring the liberties were in crutches ministry hallelujah hallelujah brother Branham said he said in dr. Moses were clogged up with all kinds of doctors and Theia ideologies all kinds of stuff unbelievers been handed down from generation to generation oh there's no such thing as healing days of miracles is past we just automatically believe it they just clogged it up there's there's power in the church and I can tell in in Minister I can show you where God gave the church power to heal cast out Devils all these things to do and now you come with your finger on the scripture where Jesus said now take it back away from the child he said what happened you got clogged up with your own separate ideas clogged up so on brother Tillman in Pentecost they are they they had signs and wonders and miracles whatever and they had false doctrine well that may be true but what about having true doctrines why do we have to get rid of part of it because the folks had it a man the UH noisy was never sent for the folks there no G would sit for the week and the folks just simply got in the way of it but there's a bride that is there known as one in this day an hour a man and we can say we've been choked down enough we've been held down enough remember today we are protesting against that token

out in the name of Jesus frightened and I proclaim deliberately proclaim that Liberty this warning hallelujah hallelujah let's not get clogged up with everything let's open up our hearts let faith begin to speak not the great wisdom of this world it just comes and clogs it up but let the Holy Spirit speak the power heads together yes now the musicians can come we made doctorates out of this message put all the power in the pulpit and a few of ninety preachers the powers taken out of the pews people don't know how to seek the will of God don't know how to hear the voice of God how long has it been in there how long has it been since you've become a real worshiper how long has it been since you got them to it down into prayer until you reached out in the spirit something was revealed down in the soul would you let him move in your life today you let something strangle you looking around with your eyes instead of yielding to the Holy Ghost you're worried about what somebody's gonna say about you our singers can't sing and let loose because you're afraid if somebody's gonna criticize them choke them down our songs can be full of worship because we're afraid of criticism preachers
