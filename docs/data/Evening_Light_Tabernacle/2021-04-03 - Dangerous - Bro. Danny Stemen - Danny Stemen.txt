wonderful weekend we're looking forward to and just want to say what a privilege it is to be able to be here part of this youth meeting i reckon that's what it is a youth meeting but i see a lot of not so youth but it's just certainly always a wonderful privilege to be amen part of a service and i want to thank brother tim amen for the privilege to be here and wonderful ministry that you have here i know that you're very blessed we also want to thank uh you that have taken in the young people into your homes and some of those young people are from our church and we want to appreciate that and i know the lord bless you for it how many is expecting a wonderful time in the lord not only that you're expecting to enjoy it but how many is expected to receive something from the lord we don't want to just come here to to watch we want to be a part of it and you don't have to be young to be part of it is that right and i i can't wait to hear brother ron preach tomorrow and and his son yeah amen amen we're all wearing these pens and for brother ron's sake you know we just believe amen that god has healed our brother and i don't know if any of you know we've come through kind of a strange year and uh and i carried i carried this book around in my bible all year long because what the enemy wanted to try to put on our church was fear fear something nameless or something that could come upon them fear of contact fear of even going to church shaking hands fear of seeing you uncovered uh fear and people became afraid to fellowship and to go to church not to go to walmart but to go to church he was afraid of those things and i thought how important it is for us to understand that the same god that told our prophet actually i just i read this to the church i want to read it to you before we start off he said an angel sent from the presence of the lord has given brother branham an infallible prescription that will heal any sufferer listen to the angel's word if you can get the people to believe shall stand before you say nothing nothing shall stand before you not even cancer he said truly the lord is good to those who would soon die to willingly guide them to complete deliverance if you have cancer or have a fear of it remember there's a god-given healing the fear of anything is often the reason we fall victim to it whether sickness or something else and the word of god tells us not to fear or set our minds on such things and he goes on to tell the statistic of of a doctor telling them that when they begin to fear that it contributed to the fact that so many people are stricken with it and they indirectly worried themselves to the place they injured their nervous system and hurt their bodies in other ways and he said surely if a medical doctor can reason that fear is an impelling force behind cancer then we as christians should realize all the more we should not fear but praise the lord for his goodness and mercy and let our minds rest and trust and love upon the good things of god and that's what i want to do this weekend don't you i believe that god is is going to do wonderful things this weekend for our young people i believe there's going to be people filled with the holy ghost amen i believe there's going to be people healed and delivered of bondages maybe that you've never been able to break free from but today is your time amen and i know this the prophet said that satan hates the book of genesis and he hates the book of revelation you know why because genesis sows his beginning and revelation shows his end i got good news for you we're in revelation [Music] hallelujah we're in revelation and it says in the first chapter of genesis the spirit of god moved and it said in the first chapter of revelations i was in the spirit on the lord's day i want you to know the spirit of the lord is still moving he moves to confirm his word and i just want to read to you a couple of things the prophet said i know this is all familiar to you but it's just good to to start off a meeting this way when john said i was in the spirit he said i love that and that could be said this is the whole of the christian life is to be in the spirit amen if we're going to live as christians we have to be in his spirit john was not talking about being in his own spirit so this goes beyond your enthusiasm amen that would not have brought the visions it had to be the spirit of god it has to be the spirit of god with us too or our efforts are in vain paul said i'll pray in the spirit i'll sing in the spirit i'll live in the spirit if there's anything good that will come to me it has to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word and made manifest by the result it bears i believe amen that's what we will see amen he goes on to say let me use another illustration suppose you need healing how many need healing what does the word say he said we've read it countless times but did not get in the spirit when reading it did we ask god for his spirit to teach us the real truth of it if we did we would call the elders confess our sins be anointed and prayed for and that would be that it might not come immediately but in his spirit it is all over there is no other court of appeal there is no other court of appeal so he said oh how we need to get in the spirit and then things will be done don't go through the acts first get in the spirit and then go through the acts and watch what god will do can't wait to see what he does let's stand together if we will amen let's bow our heads our gracious heavenly father what a privilege it is o god to stand in front of your people that you've called for your name's sake we believe we're living at the end father we believe amen the times have come upon us and these are the chosen ones you've chosen to manifest what you're doing in this hour amen the church of god is a lighthouse a light post an outpost against sin and against unbelief lord and we ask lord that you would come in a mighty way and show yourself that we can say oh what hath god hath wrought lord i'm speaking for my own congregation for the young that have come that you would lord pour out your spirit upon them oh god lord as we enter into these meetings we'll shake off tiredness and we'll be alert in our mind lord and we recognize the enemy's tricks that he's tried to play upon us and we realize you didn't call us to be the tail you called us to be the head you called us to be overcomers oh god and i pray you'll help me oh lord give me strength in my body anoint my lips anoint the ears of the ear for we ask it in jesus name amen amen let's turn in our bibles to the book of numbers the 22nd chapter and i want to make a uh or rather title the service tonight and be kind of strange title but i want to title it dangerous dangerous the prophet said that the devil knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater works should be an invincible army that makes you dangerous and we talk about how dangerous the enemy is and what he can do to us and what he's done and all the works and the destruction he's had and all the things we've seen in our even our own families and and the church problems and everything danger and we live in perilous dangerous times but you're dangerous i want to speak to you young people that way what god has called you to be in this hour amen amen numbers 22 verse 1 and the children of israel set forward and pitched in the plains of moab on this side jordan by jericho and balak the son of the poor saw all that israel had done to the amorites moab was sore afraid of the people because they were many and moab was distressed because of the children of israel and moab said unto the elders of midian now shall this company lick up all that around about us as the ox looketh up the grass of the field and balak the son of zappor was king of the moabites at that time he sent messengers therefore unto balaam the son of beor to be thor which is by the river of the land of the children of his people to call him saying behold there is a people come out from egypt behold they cover the face of the earth and they abide over against me come now therefore i pray they curse me this people i want you to notice something that he told balaam there's a people come out of egypt he don't know their true identity he just knows where they came from amen he says come i pray they curse me this people for they're too mighty for me they're dangerous pure adventure i shall prevail that we may smite them and that i may drive them out of the land for i what that he whom thou blessed is blessed and he whom thou cursed is cursed and the elders of moab and the elders of midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand and they came unto balaam and spake unto him the words of balak and he said unto them lodge here this night and i will bring you word again as the lord shall speak unto me and the princes of moab abode with balaam and god came unto balaam and said what men are these with thee and balaam said unto god balak the son of the poor king of moab is sent unto me saying behold there is a people come up out of egypt which covert the face of the earth come now curse me them peer adventure i shall be able to overcome them and drive them out and god said unto balaam thou shall not go with them thou shall not curse the people for they are blessed you can be seated may god bless the reading of his word we realize that when we read some of these stories out of the old testament that people's attention can start to wonder because they look at these things as maybe just some history or or things like that but we know this is more than history the prophet of god said the bible's a history book it's also prophecy it's also prophecy it's also a love story it's what god has wrote to you amen and so the old testament being a shadow of the new and israel being a shadow or type natural israel being a type of the spiritual church we see the things that we read are still at work and it's also a way that we can know the enemy and and know his works a prophet of god told us that amen we ought to study the enemy because we know the enemy studies us and he studies our weaknesses in fact he he he looks to see how we uh will use what has been given to us brother branham said that satan studies our strategy with the word like we we have the preaching of the word going forth tonight and he's going to watch and see how you retain that word and then how you'll use it will you believe that it's actually talking about you or is this just another sermon that is being preached by another preacher and is it just something that's going forth we're filling up time we're we're kind of excited and we've enjoyed the the social part of it or is it something deeper than that that his word is still alive and and god is is imparting something to us tonight amen something that is eternal is already a part of his word amen that the enemy amen knows that if you get a hold of this he is really amen losing aim in possessions that he once called his own i just i just wanna i just wanna to show you just so you see where my my thought process is on this what satan knows brother man sent the message that thy word he says you're here lord and the devil knows his time has come amen now the devil knows that do you know that he knows his time is coming now i want you notice what he said to this woman entering into this fear of faith here so the woman is entering some she's in the building physically she's there she's listening but as the prophet is talking to her he said she's entering into a sphere of faith and he knows he's got to lose for when she enters into something that makes her beyond her condition but now she is dangerous to what satan has planned for her [Applause] amen and we're dealing with these spirits that have come into the church what i'm reading to you here in uh in numbers is something that is also spoke about in revelation the same spirits are at work you come all the way over into the gentile church and are doing things in that church for one purpose is to hinder the work of god and destroy and prove his word wrong and to put a habit in the church of balaamism and nicolaitanism and jezebelism not different spirits the same spirit just working from depth to death put it in the church until the people are so bound down by fundamentalism and formalism that the spirit of god cannot move and is a stranger to them until that when he begins to move they say it's not the way our church looks at it that's what satan is afraid of that people will start forgetting what kind of pedigrees they came out of and they'll start aiming losing themselves in a sphere of faith where all things are possible amen like cancer amen like any kind of disease any be setting sin that you will begin to rise up in the sphere of faith the devil told you the holy ghost is not for you but you will begin to rise up in a sphere of faith and i want to tell you there is nothing nothing can stop you from receiving it then hallelujah not one i'm talking from the youngest you know what it does to a devil of generations amen when a little child comes out and can defeat a devil that has been around since the beginning of time here's somebody here that the devil cannot stop you are that generation you are that kind of people you're the people david would want in his army you're the people moses would want following him you're the people that jesus would call blessed be the name of the lord [Applause] don't get too excited this is how mennonites preach why would we have a why would we have a scripture like this israel has been a long time been a long time in the wilderness but it's about to be over and satan wants them to be fearful at their time of crossing well i want to start out these meetings by reading another quote i've already read a couple so jesus knows the word by experience he knows it by revelation he knows he's the son of god that was to come into the world he knows his standing he knows he's born in this world for that purpose and that's the reason the word of god could work through him because he knew what he was he says have you caught it yet he knew what he was satan knew knew what he was and he knew he had no business with his wisdom on the word because the word is god now if jesus knew who he was that he was a predestinated creature of time jesus the body knew he was the predestinated word the person of god that was to stand in that day to be the sacrifice of sin and he knew his adversary and he knew who he was therefore those two great forces come together knowledge and faith jesus knew the bible as good as jesus did but it wouldn't work for satan when you i want to tell you the difference between satan's wisdom on the bible and your faith on the word satan knows the bible perhaps better than anybody in this room but there's one thing you can do that he cannot do and that is you can live the word and he cannot for it is not for him he may know the word he may be able to blog about it he may able to send you emails brother tim amen of deception sinners or whatever they're called he may be able to do all of those things but he can not live the words forest he can't live what you live [Music] oh so if satan if jesus defeated satan upon faith knowing who he was he was a predestinated creature are you ready what about the predestinated bride of jesus christ now you believe the bride is predestinated that means amen that if i'm here i'm not here by chance god predestinated me to this hour that means the holy ghost is not by chance the altar call is not by chance healing is not by chance god predestinated for this hour you say how do i know it's for me because i'm here you are here to receive what god has predestinated for you in this hour the destiny the bride of christ now the church the word seed with everything god promised to put in the church is in it right now everything is in order the holy spirit has been given the spirit the seed has been sowed the evening lights are shining the sign of sodom is here and malachi 4 it's a predestinated church oh devil church of the living god here and on tape too you didn't know that you was on tape you're here do you know where you stand do you know you're called of god that the holy ghost reigns in your hearts and every word of god is real to you oh brother how is satan going to stand against it how's he going to stop it from growing listen this is a good start to the meeting how's he going to stop it amen how is he going to keep signs from following you throw them in jail i don't care what you do they tried it they rotted in jails fed the lions sought asundered jerk to pieces you can't kill a church that's predestinated [Applause] those he for knew he has called those he's called he has justified and those he has justified he's already glorified and now in the last days with every seed sowed everything in order the world in its order have you ever seen such chaos the world is in order its order time is shaped up the church is in its order the seed the evening lights the signs like he said as it was on the days of sodom an angel of god the holy spirit coming down and moving and performing the signs he did then malachi 4 amen he promised he would sin in the last days what he promised and we see it all right here sure right here in the last days of predestinated church knowing where they're standing so with the seed the holy spirit is in the church satan be careful i want to ask you a question what does satan got to be careful of what does he have to be afraid of he's got to be afraid of the holy spirit in you that is lined up with the order of the hour because i don't know about you the greatest hope the church has is the pr is the coming of the lord jesus christ everything is in order can it be brother danny absolutely it's exactly what the scripture said it may not have come to pass the way you thought it would but it's coming to pass perhaps faster than you thought it would let's look at some of the things that are in order in this scripture that i've read to you we have a colliding of events a people and of time we're going to get to those people in a minute we have the prophecy of god to abraham and he told him in the fourth generation you're come hither again they will come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full god was telling abraham that i cannot do some things that that perhaps you would want to hurry up and do now but we've got to wait till the iniquity is full the cup has to be full and god told abraham that his seed would possess the land after 400 years now god has said i'll give you the land you fall heir to it but the land already has inhabitants people with customs and habits that will not be allowed to stay there they can't be enjoyed by the church and they can't be tolerated by the church and they can't be compromised with by the church we can't have them they're actually disinherited because they will not follow god's ordinance because they had their own ordinance and the bible says god is not willing that any should perish but we should also see that there is a time that the longsuffering of god is over and you know i'm speaking more than about canaan and the amorites and abraham's seed i'm talking about america i'm talking about the bride of jesus christ i'm talking about the time we're living in god speaks to abraham at this time he speaks to him that this promise would begin to be fulfilled after four generations and it would be in that generation they would come to canaan now what would keep israel from taking the land before that was god would not thrust the people out of the land without cause and he gives to abraham the cause and that is the iniquity is not yet full prior to israel going into the land israel would have to believe that the land belonged to them that it's not their land and that church's land and that people's land and that tribe's aunt but it's my land and not yours and why would it be my land and not yours because god thrust you out would not have you because you would not have him so they would have to realize that they had just caused to take a land they had never seen they would have to believe they're not taking someone else's land but they're taking their land back they would have to be convinced this land is my land and to do this god himself would have to visit them and by his presence change their lives to fulfill the promise and his very word of his presence would change their spirit from slaves to overcomers you know when you have a church full of slaves you're constantly trying to tell them that they don't have to be that way but when you preach to a church of overcomers you don't have to keep telling them they're overcomers spirit in them knows that already amen they would very word that was given to them would be the restoration of the word that god had given abraham a restoration of the truth and putting a way of falsehoods now on the other side the land was full of iniquity and god had had enough but he would not and this is important he would not thrust out a people and fill up the land with the people like them say it again he's not going to thrust out of people and fill up the land with people like the ones he thrust out then if he did god is not god he's not just amen but the reason he's thrusting the people out is because it's fulfilling his word that the cup of iniquity is full because god even sets boundaries on evil evil can go so far and then god says i've had enough yes amen you can vote me out you can get rid of me out of the churches you can take me out of the pulpit amen but you haven't got rid of me and so when he sets boundaries on evil he calls it iniquity at that time he said it's not full but when it was full then you'll possess the land that word for in the hebrew means shalem and it means complete when iniquity is complete but it has an emphasis it says when iniquity is completely friendly now what would that mean that is especially friendly that you know you know does that mean iniquity gets better and better and i like it more and more what does that mean iniquity is especially friendly so i want you to pay close attention to that word there we'll get back to numbers 22 but just understand where what the children of israel are coming into so with this word meaning complete their iniquity would be complete but it is emphasizing this word friendly iniquity is friendly now think of this word friendly in other words they are no longer strangers with evil but now they have become accepting and friends of it and they change themselves to become it so when god lays down his principles to israel on their own conduct in the land he shows them how far the amorites have gone and when he uses this word the people the fullness of iniquity he says they're friendly with it they are accustomed to it and god had warned the jews not to follow the ordinances of the canaanites who lived in the land for the cup would become full when it becomes ordinances when iniquity becomes ordinance leviticus 18 3 said after the doings of the land of egypt wherein you dwell you shall not do and after the doings of the land of canaan where i bring you you shall not do neither shall you walk in their ordinance the key word is iniquity has become protected by law and when it becomes protected by law and becomes the custom of the nation it becomes the custom of the people and they start trying to cancel out the ordinances of god in order to lift up their ordinances i want you to know the cup is full and it is time to change the sea when they start trying to cancel our history i want you to know it's not confederate statues they're wanting to pull down they want to pull down every statue of the living god they want to pull down church they want to pull down christian they want to pull down the holy ghost but i want you know we will not be pulled down we will be taken up god will not allow his word to be pulled down and become powerless but god said i have a people that i have restored back to my orphanage by malachi 4. malachi 4 is not a debatable doctrine it is a revelation of the move of the holy spirit and i'm looking at a root full of people whose hearts have been turned hallelujah ordinances means it's an enactment it's a translated custom it's a manner it's a statue when things like the days of sodom and gomorrah begin to be protected in a livelihood begin to be protected a perversion begins to be protected and becoming an ordinance and this what i'm doing today becomes a hate crime amy god says the cup of america is full [Music] you want to protect spirits that hold my people bound you want to protect perversion that makes them lose your identity this isn't a gender problem it's a god problem people have forgot what they were doing churches have forgot what the pulpit is for [Applause] we have a church full of victimizations church full of victims if you think of yourself as a victim you're never changed [Applause] oh brother danny we need reparations we need this we need that i want to tell you amen you need restoration you don't need no evil government to stand up for you and say all you need just don't work we'll give you money you do this don't work we'll give you this we'll give you that just accept what we are let me tell you the church of the living god don't need me to be propped up by evil amen she knows who she is and she knows the gods he serves amen says i've never seen the righteous forsaken brother daddy but i'm scared in there shut our churches down there shut them down anyhow but they'll never shut down the voice and the voice is not a tape the voice is a living holy ghost living in his people i don't need to push a tape to take preeminence over a spirit amen but the god in me will rise up somebody help me preach this evening i have not started this race amen to quit it i have started this race to finish my god has not brought me this far to give up now and my god has not said go out and start another website against the prophet he never taught me to do that he called me to be a confirmation of malachi i think 4. just going to do a tag team [Applause] is already is it all right get wore out after 10 minutes all right let's look at these characters for just a minute you love the lord israel's coming at a pivotal time she's not just arrived at a random moment it is when god has predestinated a fullness of iniquity and in numbers 22 we're given an inside look at a high-level meeting between powers and principalities rulers of nations now the bible says balak was afraid do you know balak's name means devastator here the devastator is afraid who's he afraid of he's not just afraid of israel he's afraid of what they represent and i want to tell you who israel is because we're going to talk about that for a while is it's not just israel this is the new generation this is the new generation coming up and the bala the devastator is afraid so he calls on balaam who means not of the people he's not for the people is hebrew hebrew meaning he's a swallower of nations it's all about him so it's a collaborative effort it's a gathering together for one reason forces are gathered together for one reason israel is approaching amen you know there might not have been a whole lot of people know about this meeting but i guarantee there are some forces new about it and israel is approaching with a proven experience and a proven power israel is in her training she's being trained for takeover and for inheritance and the devil knows that in the holy ghost there's identification and if you realize that you're not a part of a movement but you're part of a predestinated plan he'll not be able to stop you if he can just get you to think you're part of a movement called the message amen is just another side note that could have been a denomination or another church and we can take our pick or what flavor even of a message church but if he can keep you thinking you're in a movement that you can be persuaded out of you have no power but when you realize i have come here by the predestinated plan of god i am a part of the predestinated movement just like jesus christ was a part amen it was a fullness of it i am here to be his body [Applause] amen if you realize that you're not part of a movement you're part of a plan of god the spirit of god is not something that you can school into a person we don't ask schools of the holy ghost brother danny i got the holy ghost i believe the message have you received the holy ghost since you believed the message amen it's something the prophet said that's predestinating to you by the hand of almighty god your experiences cannot be schooled or taught unto you it's predecimated by god's hand in god's foreknowledge now when when balak was afraid and he's calling for help because israel is approaching the fear of israel is starting to envelop the land rahab will say i know the lord has given you the land and your terror has fallen upon us and all the inhabitants faint because of you let me tell you this is extremely precious knowledge extremely precious intelligence of the enemy's thought process that they are extremely afraid of you i look up here and i'm like what do they have to be afraid of we're talking about another realm for she said we heard how the lord dried up the waters of the red sea for you that was one generation when you come out of egypt and what you did unto the two kings of the amorites that's the second generation that we're on the other side of jordan's sigh on an og whom you utterly destroyed and as soon as we heard these things our hearts didn't melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you for the lord your god he is god in heaven above and in the earth beneath this is an inside look young people are some of you sitting here gripped with things that you've never been able to break this is an inside look at the thought process of what's holding you you can't break free from lust because you're a victim of your fathers you can't change because you can't help it that spirit is extremely afraid that even on the first night you realize that his hold has been not as strong as you thought it was so what god wants to do is change you see that's what prayer lines that's what laying hands-on is all about is you start to move into a sphere of faith that the devil has lost every time in that sphere you know i told our church at the beginning of 2020. how many has ever heard of 2020. i told our church at 2020. i did not believe that amen if if if we're the bride of jesus christ we could not get coveted all right i never said that i said i can't tell you you won't get sick but i want to tell you one thing about this disease you do not have to be afraid because my god has never been defeated he has never been defeated somebody hear me he has never been defeated he's the champion a champion amen he's the lord of lords he's the king of kings he has never never been defeated hallelujah no wonder he's afraid [Applause] israel is a pivotal moment we're at a pivotal moment i love this i just go through it and read about i love it because i know what it can do for you young people they have watched they've been in the wilderness almost 30 40 40 years i believe the book of exodus covers about the space of one year the book of leviticus about a month from what i understand but the book of numbers covers about 38 and a half years wanderings book of numbers is an incredible book what god does there it should have been a short journey but it's taken them this long to get to this point and the book of numbers is covering in chapter 1 the first census of israel in the wilderness of sinai an account the number of fighters from the age of 20 and up and how many they would have amen that god puts the tribes in their order he separates the levites for the service of the tabernacle puts them in order they observe their first passover since departing egypt why because god is a god of order he orders man to his place and no one can take that place and that's what god is doing here with israel he's changing them from slaves to promised land all people promised land people are very different from slave people slave people you got to persuade you got to push you've got to tell them how important they are amen promised land people have already been told something and by somebody bigger than me amen israel comes from egypt a slave people unsuited for the promised land unsuited for the promise of god but god is transforming them because that's what he does he's got transforming power and he transforms them to promised land people by the word he's given them and the order it is producing there's no word like the word of god they've heard the word from mount sinai and they've built the tabernacle for worship and the aaronic priesthood has been set up and they're witnesses of the supernatural and they're walking in the supernatural slaves live day to day at the mercy of their slave masters and come be prayed for on sunday and on monday you couldn't help it well i tried brother danny but what you told me didn't work how many's never heard that i mean i should ask you have you ever heard that anyway you know you try to try to and you just know i mean that they want you to do it slaves want somebody else to do it they want somebody else to carry them remember promised land they know they living with purpose they know they go through things for purpose brother on you go through for purpose brother and i'm in greatest battle ever fought he said i thought of god's great army up there the stars and the moon and everything and he said if there's a moving of them anywhere it's for a cause see we're god's great army we come here it's for a cause amen he said and it will affect the earth and we see the results of it now some of them move into other spot it's affecting everything and i thought if that great heavenly host like that has to keep its place to make everything in order what about the disorder of the earthly host when one gets out of order how it throws the whole thing out of cater we so easily dismiss the instruction of god and we do what we want because we think it suits us and don't realize our actions put things out of order the whole program of god is upset when one member gets out of order we should continually strive to keep the order of the spirit i would to god that we bring this to a real healing service and we will tonight by the help of the lord that the group under this roof will be gathered in such a harmony that the holy spirit would place every member of the body here in such harmony till there be a spontaneous healing of our body if we would just hold our position brother daddy how am i going to hold my position tonight stay alert amen stay in tune stay with the word your position is important to the person around you how often we hear the prophet don't move around so god has placed them in order for he's taken them over to the crossing united united he's positioning for their them for their inheritance he's getting them ready a prepared people for a prepared place and we're watching this high-level meeting it's a strategy how can we best disrupt and defeat the advance that's dangerous to our way of life what is dangerous to our power what is dangerous to our authority israel represents a clear danger to idolatry to adultery to unclean living israel represents a clear dangerous danger to disease for they have an antidote with them don't go to sleep now this is a good time to pay attention israel is dangerous to superstition and unbelief for they represent the true and living god [Applause] i want you to say this message that i believe in and i'm living in is dangerous to every way of unclean living around us you can leave it but you're not live right amen it's dangerous to idolatry it's dangerous to the things of the world i want you to know the spirits that are trying to hold some of her young people amen this way of life is dangerous to your way of life these spirits have held you for years this is a dangerous moment for them it's a dangerous moment for those who don't know if they got the holy ghost or not for tonight is your night this is a dangerous moment to the enemy because he knows that now the one that's ruled your mind is going to be put under your feet you're not going to wake up tomorrow defeated you're going to wake up tomorrow a danger to the enemy's plans blessed be the name of god dangerous to every disease dangerous to cancer dangerous to high blood pressure dangerous to diabetes dangerous to homosexuality got news for you if you don't know who you are tonight you don't know what set you're off amen you can come to a message that will tell you [Applause] you think the canceled culture that hit our nation this year and the riots and everything is new now they've been rioting against the prophet trying to cancel him out for a long long time but they came too late because he's already gone in his work amen amen has been completed and is being completed and amen the devil came too late to stop the seed that has already been sold what the what god has placed inside of me the devil cannot take it out he can try he can cry but he's come too late amen he told me it's your daddy's religion but he's wrong it's my religion [Applause] don't take this story is history because it's your story think about it we've come and we've spread out before the enemy and he begins to call hey he's not calling little alley rats out here he's calling the top guys why are you so important he is calling the top guys i mean you know how many names balaam has been called through his career he's been called a prophet became a sousair huh he became some of the mothers i can't remember but he was those two he is a man of influence and balak realizes if i can get him because you stop and think about it what is a curse going to do to god's people what curse can stop him why in the world is god going to spend all this time on this and he's not going to allow him to curse israel but why is it such a story why would a curse be of such importance because god can remove a curse any time he wants but he knows satan knows what mandates do to people now i'm only taking this off brother ron not because i want to take this pin off i'm hot thank you he knows what mandates do to people he knows people follow mandates blindly sometimes they know that the devil tells them don't go to church their stop mandates you know i used to think that church was a good place to get healed but apparently it's not anymore church is just a place of information you're sick and you know it amen but i used to think that church used to be a place of the living god where that people can move up into the spears of faith and be healed and that no disease not even cancer could stand before you amen that when your faith would begin to rise up and you begin to know that the god of the bible is also my god and i'm a part of that bible and it ain't no mandate gonna keep me back brother darren that's why the devil wants to mask us up and shut us up and separate us in social distances and he wants you to be more afraid of the one that can kill your body but i want you to know don't be afraid of that guy you'll be afraid of the one that can kill both body and soul that's the one we're serving amen and if he can kill my body and soul he can also resurrect it and we are living in the day of resurrection brother danny are you preaching against the way people handed coleman absolutely not but i am preaching against fear that keeps you bound and the mandates the devil wants to hold over your life i want to worship together look what power we got going right now that in just a moment even every cancer is gone every devil is defeated what a moment we are dangerous to the devil's plans the devil said this is my eating but god said i got a generation in there you'll not be able to change they won't look like you they won't talk like you and you'll not shut them up why are you talking like that brother danny because the prophet told me he said don't just train amen train to make a knockout punch so i'm not just going to try to react to the devil i'm going to charge him hey man it's time to quit waiting to see what he'll do amen let him see what i'm made for amen i'm i've been trained i have been trained i have been trained by the champion of champions you talk about a i'm boxer to get a little drunk amen you talk about a boxer amen there was a day came in 2000 years ago where an ordinary looking man walked up a hill and the same be a death that took moses down the same be a death that took david down the same be a death that took abraham down looked at him and said he don't look no different than them but brother ram said he had something haven that could take the stinger from him i want you to know amen my lord is not just a fighter he's a champion of champions and when that devil sunk his stinger in him in the lord grabbed a hold of it amen now what can you do devil you can't hold these people if they want to be free your time is over i said your time is over we've been trained to make a knockout punch i want to give him one tonight i want the devil to know amen i'm part of that generation amen that is going up come on eli it's for you and that generation anybody in here want to identify with that generation you're going to stay back with some defeated devil drugs can't stop you sex can't stop him amen no dead or alcohol can't stop you false doctrine can't stop [Applause] you can be y'all just a moment i want to tell you something about this number is 22. brother bam said there's a bunch of fundamentalists that was gathering a bunch of fundamentalists gathering together against the children of israel he said we saw that same spirit two thousand a thousand years later fundamentalists crucified the lord jesus christ and it's fundamental it's trying to do the same thing today well this is just excitement brother danny this is excitement we believe the word but what do you think the word does i thought the word was for no but any word is just for soul and spirit but it's also for the body now you shall serve the lord with all the heart and all your mind with all your strength where's drew just strength brother bram said when i started training as a boxer i said i got in professional fighting i used to have a child didn't you know brother danny brother branham never was a professional i don't care you know what i found out i listened to brother branham and i got a lot of answers i got a lot of results i listen to these fellas that say these things are wrong they ain't brought one thing they don't even need to bring a picnic basket to the meeting there ain't nothing they got they can't even bring you rotten apples why in the world would you let somebody who's been your friend leave the message and try to persuade you out and you get shook up because of socialism [Music] all that means is the god they had amen was not the one they thought it was oh brother name they had the holy ghost oh they might have had a fall on them but it never could hold them because it never went to where they surrendered because they never surrendered their hearts i had a man tell me one time he said i serve god in this message with all my heart with all my strength i said no you didn't i said if you just served him with your heart he would have never gave it back bob don't give the heart back brother brother bannon said six seconds smith when he was training me he said he that man liked to kill me he'd knock me out of the ring in training i was skipping rope and running seven or eight miles a day and taking all the training i said six why do you have to do me that way see i said you knocked the breath out of me man i went plumb over four ropes and came out amongst the chairs and like to broke my back on him and he laughed at me said it'll do you good i said do me good how can it do me good you're about to kill me he said look billy i don't care how physically fit you are i don't care how many quotes you can quote i don't care how much knowledge it got remember when the punchings are going to come you're not going to be able to stand it right quick if you take a hard punch he said if your body's not used to coming back you'll lay there and take the count but if your body's used to taking it every time you get hit it shocks your blood and runs back to the heart he said but if your body's used to coming back when you get knocked down you'll get on your feet again it doesn't mean a thing when you get knocked down you'll get on your feet again amen you might have took a punch and you might have took another punch but you kept coming back you know why the king of kings has prayed there amen great in battle hallelujah we didn't start this fight to lose it we started it to win it you can take a punch and you took them for a year and you took some punches but you keep coming back i want you to know you're preaching on sunday has inspired ah that's just preaching it has inspired thousands to realize david's just looking for another drink of water again pretty sure neville don't like this let me just talk about this new generation because this is this is a youth service he's young a lot of new cells in him i want you i want you to look at something baelic wants to use the power of curse to defeat israel israel has already come through some major shake-ups let me dwell on some of those to show you the obstacles of the new generation this new generation has seen many hindrances to their walk and their faith they've seen dissatisfaction stir in the camps of israel fire from the lord went out from among them and destroyed many in the uttermost parts of the camp until moses prayed and fires quenched moses may have been wrong but his prayers stopped the fire are you saying brother danny moses is wrong maybe in the eyes of a mixed multitude the mixed multitude among them fell for lusting for meat remembering the fine things of egypt god sent them quail and the plague that destroyed many in writing the prophet's own family aaron and miriam murmured think about the hindrances of the new generation murmured against moses it became a very public event because the glory of god came down from the tabernacle says don't you fear god fear god talk about him that way to murmur against him this is his own family changing the effect in his commission amen and miriam is struck with leprosy it was a very public thing for the whole camp had to wait for her for a week till she's whole we come to a major event that changes everything for israel that's kadish barnia where moses sends out 12 surprise spies here to give a detailed report of the land and to travel by the route moses gave them these men that went out to spy the land these weren't just anybody these were rulers of the tribes of israel who spied out the land they came back with an evil report men of influence experts experts of the message think about the hindrances of the new generation weak don't have a voice watching experts you used to lead them in singing used to preach to them they watched experts turn their back after years and years of preaching and saying the prophet is brother branham is a vindicated prophet and all these things were true turn their back turn their back on these young people turn their back on their congregation said uh you you've been in a cult turned their back and said well it's a good land but we can't take it experts moses you brought our children out here you brought our wives right here to die i'm going to talk to you about a miracle you brought our children out here to die and they murmured against moses and against god and god got so upset he said moses i'm going to destroy every one of them and my love moses responds he turned to god he said god what will the egyptians say that you could bring them out but you can't take them in they had a good start oh man he was a prophet when he was in discernment but his message amen he got off at the end what are you going to say what is egypt going to say about this message that it can't hold their young people can't take them all the way in oh yeah they're just another church they look like all the other failing churches of america and around the world just another failing church what is the egyptians going to say lord pardon according to your mercy god said i'll pardon but it's for these spies i'm going to destroy them now and all of these that said they can't take the land they're going to wonder in this wilderness for one year for every day they were in the promised land and they're going to wonder and they're going to wonder and they're going to wonder and i am going to destroy the entire adult population except for joshua and caleb and for those young weaklings you said we're going to die i'm going to prophesy over them and i'm going to tell you those young ones you said would die you'll not die you will take the land i want you to know god has prophesied over you god has said you're going to make it god has said you're not going to be stopped if god be for you who can be against you you've had many hindrances to your faith you've added any hindrances to your walk but god is prophesied [Applause] there know the land you despised you despise this holy ghost they'll get it you've turned the holy ghost into a bunch of quotes they'll get it and they'll know me in the power they won't hide and have another brother's coat like jacob did but there'll be wrestlers they'll meet the angel and they'll wrestle and they'll open up their heart and they'll tell them exactly who they are i'm jacob the liar the deceiver and i'll change them forever i'm raising up a generation of wrestlers [Music] not somebody wearing somebody else's coat i want it not for good okay hang on let me take yours he's more my size i just want to see if you can get half [Applause] off [Applause] i got his coat on see when i put on somebody else's coat i got their experience talking about a god who does impossible math i want you to know his experiences his experience but god never asked me to put his coat on he's got one all for me made for me that fits me exactly i don't have to stretch myself i don't have to act like him i don't have to sing like him amen i can have my own coat quit trying to give me your holy ghost i want it from god you won't make it over you're going to die by the sword of the enemy but god swore these children will know the land that have been despised by their fathers let me say it again these children will know the land that even though your fathers may have despised it you will know it you'll experience its fruitfulness you'll be a partaker one of what has been rejected there's a new generation that knows the power of god because the prophecy of god cannot fail the weak ones will know the power look what this new generation had to face jason and abraham and rose up shortly after said moses you're not the only holy one we also can tell you what the thunders are what the holy ghost is we've got new apostles in the land our names are abraham and korra and that other guy and they rebelled against moses claiming they too were holy man and they gathered with him against moses and aaron 250 famous men right now these movements weren't small movements they were gathering the renowned people in the message people of influence those little children looked at that said how in the world can i resist this god said i'll show you who's holy you come up here to church let me see the way you respond to the fire boy they stayed in their tent we're not going to come up he said all right i'll kill you right there and they died there and the 250 died there abrahams abrams and the other guy jason and abram because they were not satisfied with their position it was rubinites and they'd lost they had lost their place their first fruits they'd lost their place as the firstborn arubanites they're trying to take it back encore who's a levite but wanting to be the prophet he wasn't satisfied with jesus being part of the setting up of the tabernacle the bible says that he destroyed them and their families but another wonderful thing took place in the second census the bible recounted it again in the counting of them all and they counted the new generation and then they recounted the story of dathan and abraham and cora he said but nonwithstanding the children of korah died not that means there were some children that broke the generation of their fathers and if they believed their father's lie they repented of it or they stood against what their father believed and said we're not going to follow your movement daddy amen we're going to stand i'm going to go to church whether you quit or not amen i'm going to worship god whether you do or not if my father was a drunkard i'm not going to be one amen if there's alcoholism if there's drugs in my family amen the cycle stops now you know who came out of core a bunch of singers the sons of korra that died not a bunch of singers came out amen samuel the prophet what about it is important if you stand what if the whole amen the whole uh genealogy of cora had been destroyed what if they just listen to that voice says you don't preach anymore it'd lose a generation of preachers there's some sons at cora that said you know i'm not going to listen to just the push play dogma i have something to say too because the holy ghost is in me and it's unique through my vessel can tell you what my testimony is and what god has done for me god didn't mean me to be a mindless person who just goes like this amen he put me here to take the sword in my hand and be skillful with it amen and show the devil there's another generation amen that knows how to fight that knows how to speak that knows how to preach god didn't just call tim pruitt and stop he never just called amen ron spencer and stop he called his son amen he caught his son he called other young men stand up young man and then he calls others why because if it stops in that generation that god is not the king of kings but i want you know god said there's a revival for every generation it's for you it's for you young man who is gonna run somebody run that's why the devil shouted that's why he wants to cancel you because you're god's property and your dog's property alone [Music] hey man young man my daddy told me as a young boy he told me don't believe what your mother believes she's in a court don't you believe it it worked i believe it i'm part of that well there used to be new generation remember that one what happened i'm almost done amen i'll tell you why the prophet said when every time they haven't got yet to where he got there up on the mountain you know balaam is the first recorded road rage experience that we've seen as far as i know got angry at his at his donkey and beat him three times think about the man's car was more spiritual than him that's some of the problems we got around the message right now amen their cars are more spiritual now i'm trying we got these smart cars they tell us when to break they tell us to watch out for the cars beside us they jerk the steering wheel out of our hands they stomp on the brakes they tell you you know what my truck does if i swerve a little bit few many times a little sign flashes up with a little coffee cup and says take a break i mean my truck knows when i'm tired it knows when i need coffee i'm telling you there's some vehicles more spiritual than people around you know why that you know why that donkey was more spiritual than balaam he solved god [Applause] maybe we need to bring some cars in here they mean god three times air went balaam losing his mind beating an animal and then talking to him road rage because he was more about himself than he was about the move of god and god said you know what brother branham used this he said in and does god change his mind said this is a danger line he said where man hears the word of god but then he won't do it then god will say okay go ahead and do what you want i gave you a chance balaam you ain't gonna do it okay go do what you want and you'll still be anointed and think i'm with you and i'll even speak to you some of the most beautiful portions of scripture ever recorded but i want to tell you something balaam i'm not going to let you write them down you'll say them but my prophet will write it amen and you're going to prophesy and you're going to look at jacob and you're saying let my end be like theirs but your end's not going to be like there's that new generation is going to kill you in the last battle before they cross over [Music] they're going to kill you they're dangerous you're dangerous you understand how dangerous you are you're dangerous to every devil that has ever afflicted every family of all the ages you are dangerous because the cycle stops with this generation and the devil says i mean i don't know what to do balaam is taken by balak up to a place the fundamentalists they made their altars they made their sacrifices and then balaam walks out there says baelik well come on to do it you want to do what you ask but i'm only going to say what god tells me to say well hopefully here finally get down to cursing that church don't he see all the problems in it look from the high places of baal let baal show you the wrong places in the message balaam looked down upon it how goodly are thy tents man i'm paying you boy i am going to make you famous don't you know but i told you i can only say what he told me to say you know i'm i got one for you brother ron i thought about you today when i read it but it's for you every one of you i want you to know he got up again balak said hey listen okay that one didn't work let me take you to another website these guys seem to have a little bit more experience some of them even they know how to present some of these thoughts and even some of the preachers can't refute it so you know they just you know there's a lot of a lot of questions that are unanswered in the message you know we're living right in in this time few thousand years ago there was a huge question unanswered in the message he had died the one we thought was going to lead us to die huge question and there's a lot of questions to message i'm going to lead you to another place well look at this look look they got me that church there's people failing adultery there and people in there they say they love god but some of them they're big big time thieves and look and over here some young people they can't quit their online habits i know god is gonna curse you ready balaam says all right yeah man you're right i'm on the world god would ever want to people like that let me i'ma open my mouth the spirit of god came upon him and he took up his parable and he says rise up bullet listen to me you son of a poor god is not a man that he should lie if i told you to trust me i'm not lying to you i'm telling you to trust me god is not a man that he should lie neither a son a man that he should repent god doesn't have to take anything back amen hath he said and he shall not do it hath he spoken shall he not make it good i said trust me i'll make it good i said i'd give you a baby i'll make it good i said i'd heal you i'll make it good i'd say i saved your children i'll make it good i will make it good i have a god that makes it good he's paid the bill my god is mighty my god is awesome there's no god like my god i'm telling you he's going after the prodigals right now had a boy my church gone for six years in a wrong relationship amen but god came down amen why because he had some believing parents he had to believe in sisters your cousin i saw that boy let me tell you how you say god can't hold he oh yeah he can hold that boy was in a relationship with a worldly girl living up in milwaukee working in the airline industry he said we talk about marriage he said but we never made a commitment he said but when my heart began to turn back toward god and i began to talk about it she began to say i was a monster and everything i began to believe began to come back he was coming to himself amen she left him and he says well god received me i said come back home and find out amen and he came back home i want to tell you something i'll tell you what your god said he said amen he saw him coming to far off and he ran to him and he turned around and said hey get my best robe out i'm not talking about my second-hand role i'm talking about the best road in my father's kingdom bring it on out and he put it on i want to tell you what the devil does when the devil sees that a man is starting to turn back toward home he's going to throw opportunity in front of him his boy's in the airline industry he said i i want a job back at home in florida i wanna and i wanna i wanna go back home i gotta get in church i gotta be with my church family and so when he gets a call from a friend and friend said hey you wanna move to texas say we got a job for you there working in san antonio you can work on air force one he goes no i'm trying to go to florida i said okay if you change your mind let me know and he hung up the phone he goes i just turned down a job to work for the president's airplane but the lord gave him a little bit less pain job in florida but had better robes there i said they had better roads here i want to make a statement it's not about the money it's about the robe i saw that that boy the other day you know years ago brother tim he had danced in one of your in one of your youth meetings he danced the boy loved the lord and then got it he got it taken from him he didn't have it all the way i saw that boy sitting by his grandfather he's standing there i saw the word start hitting him and i saw him raise his hand and i knew that it was trying to break out and i walked over and i looked at him says come on you can do it you can do it i know the devil's telling you're not worthy you can do it boy and that boy ran across the front ran down the side ran down the other side came back praising god amen the devil amen if you desire the devil if you desire the devil cannot stop that desire from manifesting he may have told you you're lost but he's wrong he may have told you you come can't come back but he's wrong the devil might have told you you'll never get out of drugs but he's wrong the devil may have told you you'll not be healed but he's wrong somebody tell him he's wrong you know why bailey could not curse i got to finish this just part of what bailey balaam said there but he said hey bailey listen to this this is a good one i've received commandment to bless and he's blessed i can't reverse it tried to stop this meeting from happening i can't reverse it he has not beheld iniquity in jacob hold on just a second bud i want you to know there's iniquity all over jacob but god hasn't seen it you know why god never saw it i want to tell you if the blood of bulls and goats could stop amen the sight of god what about the blood of jesus christ amen not only will he never see it he'll never remember it he won't know where it is there's power in the blood i said there's power in the blood what's your name buddy enoch that's a pretty good name to have in the message you know he walked with god good so are you amen amen now enoch last week catboy i saw him on his computer i want to tell you something about the power of the blood because enoch has the service has gone forth he says lord i reject that way of life i don't want it that's not who i am and god says you can have the better robe he said god will you forgive me he says find out yeah and god said i forgive you the devil comes back and he said now lord enoch here i saw him here on this i even got the time stamp i don't know do you know how frustrating it is when the all-seeing all-knowing god the omniscient one who knows everything who sees every nap blink its eye he knows every hair of your head where it is and where it's gone amen he knows everything about you and he turns to the archenemy and says i don't know wait a minute god i thought you knew everything i do i chose i chose to forget your sins are forgiven to walk with god may look i don't know bailey i don't know what to do with the people like this amen i mean they run wrong but god forgave him brother melon said this was a problem amen the election was the answer election was the answer election was the answer god do you see their faults here when i look on here when i look upon those people of the message when i look upon the people of even like tabernacle when i look on the people of house of fellowship put your name there when i look upon the people there's a shout of the king in the camp the shout is there the voice of god is in here i look upon her i see the blood i look upon here i see the prophets i cannot see perverseness in israel because god is with them i look in them i see myself i i've tried bailic i've really tried old buddy but i got to hey he won me he brought him out of egypt they got the strength of a unicorn there's no enchantment against jacob neither is there any divination against israel according to this time it shall be said of jacob and of israel it shall be said of them at evening light tabernacle it shall be said of them at this youth meeting what has god done i want to tell you what he done he healed some folks he saved some folks he filled some folks i want to tell you what god has wrought in this meeting the devil has lost his hold and the devil cannot stay somebody got to tell the devil this time is up you're dangerous you're dangerous you move up in that spirit face you're dangerous i'm not done bailiff i'm not done he's still anointing me he still anoint me he said behold the people shall rise up that's a great line wait a minute that's what i'm called so what is this here oh buddy oh buddy it says they're the line that's what i'm calling no no it says as a lion when it talks about you you look like the real deal but you're not these are the real deal [Applause] it rise up oh bailey said bailey said hey shut the meeting up you know what just shut up i kind of know what he said timothy learned a few phrases bailey said one more time one more time i'll bring you to another place i'm closing i'll bring you to another place one more time and bailey lifted up his eyes he said i see them abiding in their tents according to their tribes their order is still there i've got to tell you something this is one of the greatest miracles of the book of numbers that i've ever seen that a whole adult population got wiped out but the new generation never lost their strength they went right on in in the same order in the same power and the same god and they took the land what the old generation couldn't do payment god did it for you young bailey said you know what i'm done with this meeting i'm done i'm done quit it ben and said man he still anoint me i got to say one
