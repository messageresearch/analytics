[0:00] Praise God.
[0:04] I believe the Lord's doing some things
[0:06] tonight.
[0:08] I
[0:08] &gt;&gt; just want to give a little testimony
[0:10] that I want to share with you or Sister
[0:13] Jennifer Mason wrote me the other day.
[0:17] She said, "I was healed instantly of
[0:20] arthritis when I went through the prayer
[0:22] line." This is from camp. said, "I've
[0:26] hurt for several months now. So much
[0:30] that I've had to sit in recliner about
[0:32] half the day because of the pain. I've
[0:35] been on Moxyan
[0:37] to slow the progression. The weekend of
[0:40] youth camp was the hardest ever. Severe
[0:43] joint achiness.
[0:45] After the prayer line, I noticed all
[0:47] pain was gone. And I've hadn't had any
[0:50] joint pain since."
[0:53] I was praying in my heart that God would
[0:55] heal me because I have so much that I
[0:58] still have to do on a daily basis. I was
[1:01] also praying for my family. When you
[1:04] verbally rebuked the spirit of
[1:06] arthritis, it left. Honestly, honestly,
[1:11] I expected a gradual healing, but God
[1:14] gave me a miracle.
[1:16] &gt;&gt; And I'm so grateful. And I've stopped
[1:18] medication because I know I will not
[1:20] need it. It damages kidneys and liver
[1:23] after years of use.
[1:26] And I have been testifying to everyone
[1:29] of what God has done for me.
[1:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just asked today, you know,
[1:34] about it. I said, "Are you still walking
[1:36] in victory?" She said, "Absolutely. I've
[1:39] had no joint pain or inflammation since
[1:41] that night. It was really a miracle. And
[1:44] I thank can't thank God enough. I
[1:46] believe that all arthritis has stopped
[1:49] in his tracks. Amen. is stuck in his
[1:54] track. Amen. Our God reigns. Our God's a
[1:57] healer. Our God's a deliverer. If he'll
[2:00] do it once, he'll do it twice. If he
[2:02] does it twice, he'll do it three times.
[2:05] He's a God of one chance, two chances,
[2:07] three chances, four chances. This God is
[2:10] a God who will not quit. He keeps
[2:13] pouring out his blessings.
