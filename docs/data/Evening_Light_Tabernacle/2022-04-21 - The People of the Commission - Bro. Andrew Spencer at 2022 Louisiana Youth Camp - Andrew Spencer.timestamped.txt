[41:23] jesus christ and the bride said
[41:26] amen joshua 1 and verse 3
[41:29] every place that the soul of your foot
[41:31] shall tread upon that have i given unto
[41:33] you
[41:34] as i said unto moses from the wilderness
[41:37] and this lebanon even unto the great
[41:39] river the river euphrates all the land
[41:42] of the hittites and under the great sea
[41:44] dwarf the going down of the sun
[41:46] shall be your coast there shall not any
[41:49] man be able to stand
[41:51] before thee all the days of thy life
[41:54] as i was with moses so i will be with
[41:58] thee
[41:59] as i was with brother ron so i will be
[42:02] with you
[42:03] as i was with william branham so i will
[42:05] be with you
[42:07] i will not fail you young people
[42:10] i will not forsake you young people
[42:13] be strong and of a good courage for unto
[42:16] this people shall thou divide an
[42:17] inheritance
[42:20] in the land which i swear unto their
[42:22] fathers to give them only be thou strong
[42:25] and very courageous that thou mayest
[42:28] observe to do according to all
[42:30] the law which moses my servant commanded
[42:33] thee
[42:33] turn not from it to the right hand nor
[42:36] to the left that thou mayest prosper
[42:38] withersoever thou goest
[42:40] this book of the law shall not depart
[42:42] out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate
[42:45] therein day and night that thou mayest
[42:47] observe to all to do according
[42:50] to all
[42:51] that is written therein
[42:53] for then thou shalt make thy way
[42:55] prosperous and then thou shall have good
[42:58] success
[42:59] have not i commanded thee be strong and
[43:01] of a good courage be not afraid neither
[43:04] be thou dismayed for the lord thy god
[43:07] is with thee
[43:09] wither so ever thou goes may god bless
[43:11] his word you may be seated in the
[43:13] presence of the lord
[43:15] also in romans 8 and verse 14
[43:18] for as many as are led by the spirit
[43:21] they are the sons of god
[43:24] for ye have not received the spirit of
[43:26] bondage again to fear but you have
[43:27] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[43:32] we cry abba father
[43:35] it's an amazing thing to begin to think
[43:37] this morning that the god of heaven
[43:39] wants to be a part of your daily lives
[43:41] outside of this outside of this meeting
[43:44] he didn't just bring you to this meeting
[43:45] so that you could have a camp experience
[43:47] or just to just to have something that
[43:49] would stay here in this building but
[43:51] something that would take you and it
[43:52] would lead you all the days of your life
[43:54] maybe you came here seeking more of the
[43:56] holy ghost maybe you came here just just
[43:59] just desiring different things in your
[44:00] life but god is not wanting it just to
[44:02] stay here but god is wanting to take you
[44:05] all the way through all your life and to
[44:07] begin to think that the god of heaven
[44:09] that spoke the worlds into existence to
[44:11] think that that god has predetermined
[44:14] this time and the times that are set
[44:16] before you he is set and he has
[44:18] predetermined our comings and
[44:20] predetermined our goings and but i
[44:23] believe that we are a people of of the
[44:25] last stage of people that as brother ron
[44:27] preached last night of final runners but
[44:30] a people that have caught the
[44:31] inspiration of the word and truly we are
[44:34] moving into the atmosphere of romans 8 1
[44:38] that there is therefore now no
[44:40] condemnation to them that are in christ
[44:43] jesus and we are watching what william
[44:45] branham was was seeing in vision has now
[44:48] become materialistic and we are watching
[44:51] a bride rising out of the scriptures
[44:54] when you go to studying over in the book
[44:56] of revelation and you see when jesus is
[44:58] there standing in the midst of the seven
[45:00] golden candlesticks and he's saying and
[45:02] he's holding those seven stars in his
[45:04] hands you can imagine how that how the
[45:06] how that god felt when he was as he was
[45:09] holding those seven stars in his hands
[45:11] he's built them in such a way he's got
[45:13] characteristics and paul characteristics
[45:16] and in luther and wesley and william
[45:18] branham but to watch as as he would as
[45:20] he would scatter as
[45:22] he would send out those messengers to
[45:24] that day you can imagine how that god
[45:26] felt knowing that as i release this star
[45:29] from my hand it's going to go out and
[45:31] it's going to bring unto me a people
[45:33] that have my characteristic they're
[45:35] identified with my identity because my
[45:38] life is on the inside of them and it is
[45:40] my seed that has placed them where they
[45:43] are you can imagine how god felt knowing
[45:45] that there was no corruption in the body
[45:47] then and knowing that there is no
[45:49] corruption in the body now and we know
[45:52] that god has not had a new thought about
[45:54] about anything in his life so what god's
[45:57] seen you as is what you will be so so no
[46:00] matter what you go through after this
[46:02] camp no matter what you go through know
[46:05] how no matter how long we go throughout
[46:07] this layout of seeing age god has not
[46:10] had a new thought about you what you are
[46:12] is what you will be what he's seen you
[46:14] as before the foundation of the world is
[46:17] exactly what he sees you as and what you
[46:20] will be no matter what you come up
[46:22] against young people you have been
[46:24] destined to fulfill a commission and
[46:26] that's what i want to preach to you this
[46:28] morning on is the people of this
[46:30] commission
[46:32] god didn't just raise up god doesn't
[46:34] just didn't raise us up just to have
[46:36] another church group or just to have
[46:38] another young people or just to have
[46:40] another church service or just to have
[46:41] another building but god raised up a
[46:44] people that would fulfill the purpose in
[46:47] their life god has a purpose for your
[46:49] life young people the enemy might want
[46:51] to tell you that you don't have a
[46:52] purpose but god has a plan for your life
[46:55] and you would go to studying out the
[46:57] bible brother adam would tell us that
[46:59] satan hates two books of the bible and
[47:01] it's genesis and revelations because one
[47:04] tells of his beginning and then one
[47:06] tales of his ending and we realize that
[47:10] we have already read the back of the
[47:11] book we know what it says about satan we
[47:14] know what it says about his future but
[47:16] young people you've got a future it's
[47:19] not the future of destruction it's not
[47:21] the future of laodicea it's not the
[47:24] future of depression it's not the future
[47:26] of diseases your future is a rapture
[47:29] your future is a body change your future
[47:32] is destined for glory to walk on streets
[47:35] of gold and to be exactly what god
[47:37] destined for you to be before the
[47:39] foundation of the world you will not let
[47:42] this word fall on the ground because you
[47:44] are a part of god and when you see that
[47:46] word laying there you'll see i'll be
[47:48] that one i'll pick up that stone i'll
[47:51] pick up that rock i pick up my sword i
[47:54] am here to fulfill i am here to possess
[47:58] every gate of the enemy
[48:03] brother man would say he said i wish you
[48:05] could stand with me and see the faces of
[48:07] people
[48:08] when when satan knows that he's going to
[48:10] be exposed he said it isn't the people
[48:12] that i'm talking about it's it's that
[48:14] satan has got to hold in their lives so
[48:16] sin indifference disease but you should
[48:18] see their faces he said satan knows that
[48:21] he's going to be exposed and most
[48:23] peculiar changes come over the people
[48:26] countenance and he said satan is afraid
[48:29] he knows that the spirit of god is about
[48:32] to let the people know of his works
[48:35] that is why he hates these meetings so
[48:38] much
[48:39] when names are called and diseases are
[48:41] revealed satan hates it he said now what
[48:43] is this it's not mind reading it's not
[48:46] telepathy it's it it
[48:48] he said nor is it witchcraft he said it
[48:51] is a revelation by the holy ghost he
[48:55] said that is the only way that i can
[48:56] know it of course the carnal mind will
[48:58] call it anything but the holy ghost now
[49:01] watch you watch after this meaning there
[49:03] will be all kinds of carnality of men
[49:06] that try to stop what happened here they
[49:08] will try to say that it was just a
[49:10] workup of man they'll try to say that
[49:12] you just got under the atmosphere of a
[49:14] man but you didn't get in the atmosphere
[49:16] of a man
[49:17] there's no way that a man can make you
[49:19] do what you do because you are destined
[49:22] to walk over top of the enemy if it was
[49:25] that easy then why wouldn't we just walk
[49:27] out into walmart and said why don't you
[49:29] do this but you have walked into the
[49:31] presence of the shekinah glory and
[49:34] revelation gives you authority and when
[49:36] you recognize your position in jesus
[49:38] christ hell knows it's going to lose
[49:41] hell knows it can't win hell knows it
[49:44] ain't got you no more satan watched you
[49:46] young people last night
[49:48] he watched what you did and you rejected
[49:51] the devil's lie you turned down and you
[49:53] said i will stand for god when nobody
[49:56] else will stand and satan realizes
[50:00] that you cut a hold of something that'll
[50:02] take you further than a camp experience
[50:05] more than just a church service more
[50:08] than just a motion but a revelation
[50:12] that gives you authority to walk
[50:14] as joshua was commanded to walk over
[50:17] every possession that was rightfully his
[50:20] [Music]
[50:21] he said but let me show you another
[50:23] reason that satan hates this book of
[50:24] revelation of jesus christ in the church
[50:27] he knows
[50:28] that jesus is the same yesterday today
[50:30] and forever and he changes not he knows
[50:33] he knows a whole lot more than do 90 of
[50:37] the theologians he knows that since god
[50:40] he knows that since god is immutable in
[50:42] his nature that he's immutable in his
[50:44] ways
[50:45] thus satan knows assuredly that the
[50:47] original church of pentecost with the
[50:50] power of god mark 16 in action is the
[50:53] true church that jesus claims as his own
[50:56] all else is false it has to be he said
[50:59] but remember this that christ in the
[51:01] true church is a continuation of the
[51:04] book of acts brother branham would say
[51:06] that what pentecost was
[51:08] what pentecost was at the beginning was
[51:11] a standard so if we're going to be a
[51:13] standard if god is going to raise a
[51:15] standard we've got to go back to the
[51:17] standard of pentecost we've got to go
[51:19] back to the apostolic faith this message
[51:22] isn't something new this message isn't
[51:24] something that just came about but this
[51:27] is a restoration of the faith of the
[51:30] apostolic fathers our hearts have been
[51:33] turned back and you have been divinely
[51:35] appointed to fulfill your commission
[51:38] to do what you can do and only what you
[51:41] could do and if it was easy anybody
[51:43] would do it but god is not looking for
[51:45] somebody that's got a wishbone god is
[51:48] looking for somebody that's got the
[51:49] backbone like a small log like buddy
[51:52] robinson would say that's got power to
[51:54] live in overcoming life got power to
[51:56] defeat the devil because you've got the
[51:58] same power the same life the same holy
[52:02] ghost
[52:03] brother madam said that the holy ghost
[52:05] gives you power of speech power of
[52:07] prayer power to live a holy life
[52:10] power to overcome the world
[52:12] someone that's moving in the spirit of
[52:15] the composer that's moving in the rhythm
[52:18] [Applause]
[52:20] now what i love
[52:22] what i love is good music what i love
[52:25] i'd rather pray i'd rather sing than i
[52:26] would preach
[52:27] but it's been my lord in life to go
[52:29] ahead and preach to you so maybe i'll
[52:30] sing to you while i preach a little bit
[52:32] today but when you start moving in the
[52:35] rhythm of the music
[52:38] you ever watch somebody when they're off
[52:40] beat you can't help that person to save
[52:42] their life they clap off hands it's a
[52:45] pandemic sometimes when they can't even
[52:47] they can't even clap to save their hands
[52:49] but god
[52:53] they can't clap to save their hands
[52:54] bless god
[52:57] that case
[52:58] but you watch somebody that don't they
[53:00] just don't know how to do it they don't
[53:02] know what they're doing it seems like
[53:04] man every they look like a fish out of
[53:05] water but you want somebody that's
[53:08] moving in the rhythm of the music
[53:13] so let me say this the methodists can't
[53:15] clap their life can't clap their hands
[53:17] to save their hands
[53:20] the westlands can't move like you are
[53:22] moving they cannot move in the rhythm of
[53:24] the message of the hour but you have
[53:26] been destined young people to walk
[53:29] in the spirit of the composer to move in
[53:32] the rhythm of the music
[53:34] when he says there is no weapon that is
[53:36] formed against you you move into the
[53:38] rhythm and say that's for me
[53:43] that this is a faith that overcometh the
[53:45] world
[53:46] this is our victory this is our triumph
[53:49] this is our glory this is our moment and
[53:52] you start moving into the spirit of the
[53:54] composer
[53:57] you got the sheet music if the sheet
[53:59] music says that i'm the lord thy god
[54:01] that heals all of your diseases
[54:06] there's going to be somebody that
[54:08] aircraft
[54:09] amen
[54:11] i'm the lord that god that still saves
[54:13] young people amen i'm the lord thy god
[54:16] that still delivers
[54:19] i'm the lord thy god that'll keep you
[54:21] i'm the lord thy god that'll sustain you
[54:26] now notice
[54:28] you can be seated just for a moment he
[54:29] said in the invisible union he said we
[54:31] know
[54:32] that the modern church in its present
[54:34] condition
[54:35] in its present state is in no condition
[54:36] to finish up the great commission that
[54:38] god gave the church for this day
[54:40] he said we know that the church could
[54:42] not the pentecostal church by no means
[54:45] could carry out the last day's message
[54:47] in its present condition
[54:50] he said why he can't even agree with one
[54:52] or two three words how you going to do
[54:54] it he can't do it you see denominations
[54:57] is out he said it's going to be an
[54:58] elected people that's elected for it you
[55:02] are elected to tear satan's kingdom down
[55:04] you are elected to walk into the full
[55:07] manifestation of the sons of god and
[55:09] when you start watching jesus's first
[55:12] commission and jesus's last commission
[55:15] your watch has got the same works
[55:18] when he commissioned his church over in
[55:19] luke chapter 10 that he taught him to go
[55:22] out there and preach the gospel to lay
[55:24] hands on them and you watch his second
[55:26] commission his last commission the great
[55:28] commission it had the same works
[55:31] it had the same power and it was go out
[55:34] and lay hands on the sick and they shall
[55:36] recover in my name shall they cast out
[55:39] their voice in my name shall they tread
[55:41] over serpents and young people you've
[55:43] got a job to do
[55:45] it ain't just my job it ain't just
[55:47] brother ron's job but you've got a job
[55:48] to do and you've been elected to rise
[55:51] above every critic to rise above every
[55:54] skeptic to rise above every power and to
[55:57] rise above every devil of hell
[56:00] well lebron when he come he preached the
[56:01] three calls he even preached a threefold
[56:03] purpose and christ the mystery of god
[56:05] revealed he said first it's to reveal
[56:07] himself second to have the preeminence
[56:10] and third it was to restore the kingdom
[56:13] back to its rightful position and here
[56:15] he has came down and he has revealed
[56:17] himself and now he has the preeminence
[56:20] in his body and he is descending once
[56:22] again but on rapture mourning he won't
[56:25] leave you
[56:27] because there's something on the inside
[56:29] of you that he cannot leave because our
[56:32] identity is attached to his identity
[56:35] you do not you cannot exist without him
[56:41] what good would it do to give this young
[56:42] people a bunch of power
[56:44] what what would good what good would it
[56:46] do to give them a task or give them a
[56:48] job if god didn't give them he didn't
[56:50] give them the ability or if he didn't
[56:52] give them the knowledge to be able to
[56:54] create and finish the work but god has
[56:56] given you ability young people to go out
[56:59] there and cast out every devil
[57:01] he's given you a power to walk and tread
[57:04] over serpents
[57:05] he what good would it have done to give
[57:07] josh with the land and tell him that
[57:09] it's yours if you go studying it out it
[57:11] was the same land that was promised to
[57:14] his father abraham
[57:16] he'd give him an ability to walk out
[57:18] there and go in there and take it over
[57:21] and there's a young people that have
[57:23] risen up in satan's
[57:24] eden that are facing the darkest of days
[57:28] facing every movement of hell every
[57:30] right every right that that the enemy is
[57:33] trying to take away from you you are
[57:35] rising up and say not today satan
[57:38] you are facing every devil you are
[57:40] facing every enemy that's been released
[57:42] out of river euphrates
[57:44] but god has not sent you here unequipped
[57:47] he has sent you here with the most
[57:48] powerful weapon that can be placed in
[57:50] the hands of humanity and that's the
[57:52] word of god
[57:59] hallelujah
[58:01] jesus said even the spirit of truth john
[58:03] 14-17
[58:05] even the spirit of truth whom the world
[58:07] cannot receive
[58:08] because it seeth him not
[58:11] neither knoweth him but ye know him for
[58:13] he dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[58:16] he said i will not leave you comfortless
[58:18] i will come to you yet a little while
[58:20] and the world sees me no more
[58:22] but you see me
[58:24] because i live
[58:26] you live also at that day you shall know
[58:28] that i am in the father and the father
[58:30] me and i in you and you and me
[58:33] revelation gives you authority and this
[58:36] is your day
[58:38] this is your moment you have been risen
[58:40] for this time for this moment for this
[58:43] hour
[58:44] at this day
[58:46] satan will not win
[58:49] satan couldn't stop cancer satan
[58:51] couldn't stop saying couldn't stop
[58:53] brother with cancer satan can't stop you
[58:56] with all the things in your life
[58:58] you have been commissioned to walk out
[59:00] there and take back
[59:02] everything that the devil has stole from
[59:05] you
[59:09] he's not sent you here weaponless but
[59:11] this is the hour of full manifested sons
[59:14] of god that walk out there and take
[59:17] every power
[59:18] away from satan
[59:20] to walk out there you are watching the
[59:23] manifestation of almighty god being
[59:25] dispersed into a pediatric a people
[59:28] imparted with the same power
[59:31] with the same life
[59:33] you see brother random said that god
[59:35] knew that we were coming into a great
[59:37] intellectual move just like just like
[59:39] jesus did when he came in his days he
[59:42] said but that's why he sent you a
[59:44] comforter that i will not leave you and
[59:46] i will not forsake you
[59:49] jesus paul said in second corinthians 10
[59:52] he said our weapons are not carnal but
[59:55] mighty and bringing down the strongholds
[59:57] of satan and casting down every
[1:00:00] imagination and every high thing that
[1:00:02] exalts itself against the knowledge of
[1:00:04] god
[1:00:06] god didn't walk in here and tell you
[1:00:08] you've got power just so you can let
[1:00:10] those things stay in your life young
[1:00:11] people you're not going to walk out of
[1:00:13] here
[1:00:14] the same way you walked in
[1:00:17] you're not going to walk in here with
[1:00:18] the same baggage that you walked in with
[1:00:22] i hate to say it brother david but i
[1:00:23] need more
[1:00:26] i need more power i need more right here
[1:00:28] in this here here monitor but you need
[1:00:30] you you have everything that you have
[1:00:32] need of
[1:00:34] you have everything that you have need
[1:00:36] of to go through this journey and g and
[1:00:38] paul said that we have this treasure in
[1:00:41] earthen vessels
[1:00:43] and jesus would say that out of that
[1:00:46] belly that he that is a thirst let him
[1:00:48] come unto me and let him drink for out
[1:00:50] of his belly shall flow rivers of living
[1:00:53] water
[1:00:55] is that right so there is a power that's
[1:00:57] laying there there's an anointing that
[1:00:59] is laying there notice it's rivers
[1:01:02] rivers plural but water
[1:01:06] water
[1:01:07] notice it's the same power it's the same
[1:01:09] anointing it's the same holy spirit it's
[1:01:12] the same manifestation working through a
[1:01:15] people out of your belly so young people
[1:01:17] there's a miracle inside of you
[1:01:20] there's an anointing on the inside of
[1:01:21] you
[1:01:23] there's something on the inside that's
[1:01:24] got to get out
[1:01:26] the healing is in the body let it loose
[1:01:28] there is power in the body let it loose
[1:01:31] there's a miracle in the body
[1:01:33] your job is waiting for your
[1:01:35] manifestation your school is waiting for
[1:01:37] your manifestation your family is
[1:01:39] waiting for the manifestation
[1:01:42] you have this treasure in earth and
[1:01:44] vessels
[1:01:46] for out of you will flow the goodness
[1:01:48] and the grace of god
[1:01:51] why satan wants to convince you that you
[1:01:53] that you're not worthy enough
[1:01:55] because he's scared of the power that
[1:01:56] you have
[1:01:58] because he's never tasted he's never had
[1:02:00] a foretaste of the power that you have
[1:02:03] now satan's got power and his power is a
[1:02:06] bluff and he's trying to steer you away
[1:02:08] from what you are destined to be and
[1:02:10] what you are called to be but you have
[1:02:12] walked around that scarecrow and come
[1:02:14] around here and ate on the true word of
[1:02:16] god
[1:02:17] and you set here as an ambassador of
[1:02:19] almighty god
[1:02:21] i am an ambassador in bonds with jesus
[1:02:23] christ i'm an ambassador in what god's
[1:02:25] called me to do i'm an ambassador
[1:02:32] when you are an ambassador
[1:02:34] all the power of that of that nation is
[1:02:37] behind you if you are an ambassador of
[1:02:40] the united states all the power of the
[1:02:42] united states is with you if you're an
[1:02:44] ambassador of almighty god all of heaven
[1:02:47] is behind you and we're living in an
[1:02:49] hour when our hell has been cursed has
[1:02:52] turned loose but our heaven's been
[1:02:53] turned loose through you're not on your
[1:02:55] turf no more devil you have walked onto
[1:02:58] my tongue
[1:03:00] and i have come back to take everything
[1:03:03] that is rightfully mine
[1:03:10] satan you will regret the day you
[1:03:13] pointed your sword in his family
[1:03:16] satan you will regret the day you put
[1:03:18] cancer on erica parker saying you will
[1:03:22] regret the day you put depression say
[1:03:24] you will regret
[1:03:26] saying you will regret who i am what you

[1:03:34] you will regret the devil that you were
[1:03:37] born
[1:03:45] hallelujah
[1:03:48] revelation gives you authority
[1:03:51] and jesus said to him that overcometh
[1:03:54] will i grant to sit with me
[1:03:56] in my throne
[1:03:57] not on my throne but in my throne and in
[1:04:00] my throne there is a dominion there is a
[1:04:02] power and there is a domain and it is a
[1:04:05] domain that reaches just as far as it
[1:04:08] boundaries does when joshua was told
[1:04:11] that this is your land he didn't walk
[1:04:13] out there and say you know we need to
[1:04:15] pray about it
[1:04:16] we need to think about it
[1:04:18] well it was the same promise that was
[1:04:20] given to abraham it was the same words
[1:04:23] and the same boundaries the same land
[1:04:25] that was given to abraham was the same
[1:04:27] boundaries that was given to joshua
[1:04:30] though abraham never made a walk through
[1:04:32] all of it but if she was going to walk
[1:04:33] through it
[1:04:35] and jesus left some work for you to do
[1:04:38] young people
[1:04:43] i got scripture to back up what i just
[1:04:44] said
[1:04:46] when jesus went up there to the woman at
[1:04:48] the well
[1:04:50] all he did
[1:04:51] after the fact after the fact that she
[1:04:53] went up there and said come and see a
[1:04:56] man
[1:04:56] who has told me all the things of my
[1:04:58] life is this not the very messiah he
[1:05:01] went up there and he taught them the
[1:05:02] word
[1:05:05] but he never did one miracle
[1:05:08] you know why i didn't do one miracle
[1:05:10] brother branham was able to catch into
[1:05:12] it and said he knew that philip was
[1:05:13] coming that one day he would go down
[1:05:15] there to samaria and he would produce
[1:05:17] the same works he left to work for
[1:05:20] philip to do over there in samaria
[1:05:22] i say this to you you have been given a
[1:05:24] power and you will do the greater works
[1:05:27] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:05:29] you ask what you will and it shall be
[1:05:31] given unto you
[1:05:34] you've got a power and you've got a job
[1:05:36] to do you are the people of the
[1:05:38] commission you are the people of the
[1:05:40] final voice there's been churches
[1:05:42] churches and brides brides but there's
[1:05:45] got to come one that spoke mechanics and
[1:05:47] the dynamics
[1:05:49] you have an authority that hell cannot
[1:05:51] stop
[1:05:56] hell can't stop you depression can't
[1:05:59] stop you
[1:06:02] you remember in the bible there was a
[1:06:04] woman by the name of joseph bed that she
[1:06:06] had a prayer meeting and amram and had a
[1:06:09] prayer meeting and they were seeking a
[1:06:10] deliverer because there was one that was
[1:06:12] promised that was coming and joseph bed
[1:06:15] had had a meeting up there
[1:06:17] and she realized when she come to a time
[1:06:20] that moses was the deliverer she'd cut
[1:06:23] that by a revelation
[1:06:25] she got that by a revelation that he was
[1:06:28] the deliverer
[1:06:30] and that angel i told him told abraham
[1:06:33] all about all about his days but there
[1:06:35] had went out
[1:06:37] a type
[1:06:38] i typed to kill out all the resurrection
[1:06:41] to kill out all the deliverance and
[1:06:42] there went out a type
[1:06:44] but there was a woman that had caught a
[1:06:46] revelation that this was the deliverer
[1:06:54] and there was a king's commission and
[1:06:56] said you go out there and you drowned
[1:06:57] all those babies there was a commission
[1:06:59] that was over top of her but brother
[1:07:01] branham said she tapped into a
[1:07:02] revelation
[1:07:04] he said she tapped into a revelation
[1:07:06] over in john chapter 11 that i am a
[1:07:09] resurrection and the life and because
[1:07:11] she had that revelation and gave her
[1:07:14] authority to place moses into that bull
[1:07:17] rush and put him down in that ark and
[1:07:19] send him out in there in that crocodile
[1:07:21] infested waters she sent him out there
[1:07:24] by a revelation because it gave her an
[1:07:27] authority that i can do this
[1:07:30] young people you can do this you can
[1:07:33] send your faith out upon the waters and
[1:07:35] it'll return to you
[1:07:39] she's sitting out there on those waters
[1:07:41] and god was so with her and she tapped
[1:07:44] into that revelation that i am the
[1:07:46] resurrection and the life and god
[1:07:48] dispersed the angel gabriel and said
[1:07:51] gabriel if he gets in trouble you put
[1:07:53] his foot you put your foot on the brow
[1:07:56] of that bull rush and you walk out there
[1:07:58] you guide him if he gets in a whirlpool
[1:08:01] you get him out of trouble
[1:08:03] if a crocodile steps up you put your
[1:08:06] foot on him i say this if you are
[1:08:09] getting in trouble he is jehovah's emma

[1:08:31] same angel of the covenant
[1:08:33] [Applause]

[1:08:42] now one time
[1:08:44] one time let me give you a little bit of
[1:08:46] a story it's a story don't get
[1:08:48] fascinated don't get all caught up it's
[1:08:49] a story
[1:08:52] but one time there were some animals
[1:08:53] that were playing a game of football
[1:08:57] it's a story
[1:09:00] there's some animals that were playing a
[1:09:02] game of football
[1:09:04] and these two teams had come against
[1:09:06] each other the giraffe and the rhino
[1:09:08] and the water buffalo on one side of the
[1:09:10] team and on the other side there was a
[1:09:12] lion and a tiger and all these other
[1:09:14] animals and they were going against each
[1:09:16] other and the team with the rhino they
[1:09:18] had they had run over top they'd run
[1:09:21] over top of the team of the line all
[1:09:23] game long and the score at halftime was
[1:09:25] 75 to nothing
[1:09:27] my name was taking
[1:09:29] they was taking a whooping
[1:09:32] so so the line went in there and pumped
[1:09:35] his team up said you know what
[1:09:36] we can do this
[1:09:38] we can do this all we got to do is stop
[1:09:40] that rhino he keeps walking all over top
[1:09:42] of us he keeps running over top of us
[1:09:44] all we got to do is stop him if we stop
[1:09:47] him we can win this
[1:09:48] if we can stop satan
[1:09:54] if we can cut him off
[1:09:56] if we could say sacred to nothing but a
[1:09:59] bluff you have no power over dutch
[1:10:02] children every rock was stripped away
[1:10:04] from you at calvary
[1:10:06] that ain't a story that's the truth
[1:10:09] and you are a son of the most high god
[1:10:12] satan take your hands off of god's
[1:10:15] property i adore you by the power of the
[1:10:17] living god
[1:10:19] you won't walk over me but i'll walk
[1:10:21] over you
[1:10:30] so they get out there
[1:10:32] and the lion tells his kicker
[1:10:35] whatever you do
[1:10:36] don't kick it to the rhino
[1:10:39] he'll destroy it
[1:10:41] he goes out there
[1:10:43] and sure enough the rhino
[1:10:45] sure enough the rhino grabs a hold of
[1:10:47] that ball gets it and he takes off
[1:10:49] running and he's almost all the way to
[1:10:51] the end zone he runs over top of the
[1:10:53] line he runs over top of the tiger and
[1:10:55] runs over the rest of the tent on that
[1:10:57] team
[1:11:00] but he got almost to the end zone
[1:11:02] and all of a sudden the rhino fell over
[1:11:06] dead as a doornail

[1:11:23] over top of depression

[1:11:40] morning that you are the people of a
[1:11:43] final voice of the final age that will

[1:18:36] hey something powerful about the way you
[1:18:37] handle yourself
[1:18:40] you could take your slave
[1:18:41] and you could put him out in a cotton
[1:18:43] field
[1:18:44] and he was going to carry himself the
[1:18:45] same way
[1:18:46] [Music]
[1:18:48] and you could take that same slave
[1:18:50] and put him back there where he was a
[1:18:51] king's son
[1:18:52] and he'll carry himself away the same
[1:18:55] way
[1:18:58] the only difference is
[1:19:00] is the way that he was dressed
[1:19:06] the only difference is the way that he
[1:19:08] was dressed and the way that he was
[1:19:10] treated

[1:24:33] about all the battles that you've been
[1:24:35] through
[1:24:36] abraham i really don't care i really
[1:24:38] don't care that it took you 25 years i
[1:24:41] don't i really don't care i really don't
[1:24:43] care how hard you had to battle to get
[1:24:45] where you got
[1:24:47] but what i do care is is that god that
[1:24:48] yet you get that promise
[1:24:51] that you got the promise
[1:24:55] abraham
[1:24:59] you don't know my story brother answer
[1:25:01] you don't know what i've been through
[1:25:03] all i know is there's a victory on your
[1:25:05] way
[1:25:06] all i know is there's a promised son on
[1:25:08] your way and it is easter it is the
[1:25:12] resurrection it is the life it is the
[1:25:15] truth it is the way
[1:25:17] [Applause]
[1:25:23] if the king don't extend his scepter to
[1:25:25] you
[1:25:26] you're finished
[1:25:28] you're finished
[1:25:30] but not only is esther finished but the
[1:25:33] whole entire race of the jews sister
[1:25:35] charity was finished if he doesn't
[1:25:38] extend his scepter
[1:25:41] but because there was a plot
[1:25:45] there was a plot to stop you there was a
[1:25:47] plot to keep you but there's a plot by
[1:25:50] almighty god
[1:25:53] i've watched over them all their life i
[1:25:56] have kept them i have handled them in my
[1:25:58] hands and i'll take good care of them
[1:26:02] you see haman was wanting to destroy you
[1:26:06] haman was wanting to thrash out all of
[1:26:09] your lineage and all that what you were
[1:26:12] but esther had heard a word
[1:26:16] haman is after you
[1:26:18] haman is after you young people you have
[1:26:20] walked into this camp one way and you
[1:26:22] walk out another way but there's an
[1:26:23] enemy that has got a target on your back
[1:26:26] he's gonna say you didn't really get it
[1:26:28] you really didn't break through you
[1:26:30] really didn't have it
[1:26:34] satan has got his eyes on you sister
[1:26:36] emily did it really happen did you
[1:26:39] really get something did you really
[1:26:41] break through
[1:26:45] because he's wanting to crash out your
[1:26:46] lineage
[1:26:48] and the church of the firstborn
[1:26:54] but esther goes in
[1:26:56] and because she decides to go in
[1:26:59] because she was raised for such a time
[1:27:01] as
[1:27:02] this she was willing to be a standard
[1:27:08] she was willing to go in
[1:27:10] she was willing to go into the king's
[1:27:12] courts and because she was willing to go
[1:27:14] in brother nathan she walked in there
[1:27:16] and the whole entire jew race was
[1:27:19] completely set free
[1:27:21] and the gallows that haman had built for
[1:27:24] mordecai
[1:27:25] [Applause]
[1:27:30] if mercy wasn't extended to the gentiles
[1:27:33] there wouldn't be a race that's called
[1:27:35] the queen of heaven but because mercy
[1:27:38] said no
[1:27:40] haven
[1:27:41] you are built that gallop for yourself
[1:27:45] it's time that you hang that depression

[2:00:49] god has been
[2:00:51] here one service
[2:00:53] after the other after the other
[2:00:56] ministering through the different
[2:00:57] ministries
[2:00:59] god touching your hearts time after time
[2:01:02] giving you strength for the journey
[2:01:05] amen we we want to say
[2:01:07] we're near home than we were yesterday
[2:01:11] we're a lot closer than we were
[2:01:13] and this may be the last camp until that
[2:01:17] youth camp in the skies
[2:01:19] amen you know we're we're made for the
[2:01:22] earth god made us that way
[2:01:25] and we're going to
[2:01:27] we're going to leave here just for a
[2:01:28] short time
[2:01:30] go to the marriage supper of the lamb

[2:02:04] our time of temptation and trials is
[2:02:07] over
[2:02:09] no more
[2:02:12] and then they will be gathered to the
[2:02:14] great white throne judgment
[2:02:15] but we won't be in the judgment we'll
[2:02:18] sit with him
[2:02:20] in the judgment
[2:02:22] because why here you have passed from
[2:02:24] death
[2:02:25] unto life

[2:03:13] them
[2:03:14] others lord have been baptized with the
[2:03:17] holy ghost
[2:03:18] the fire of god has come to dwell in

[2:06:01] god
[2:06:02] whatever the lord did for you is
[2:06:04] wonderful
[2:06:06] but
[2:06:07] let's just
[2:06:08] just say it's the beginning
[2:06:11] it's not the end you're not going to put
[2:06:13] a period or even a comma you're going to
[2:06:16] continue that experience by feeding on
[2:06:20] the word of god
[2:06:21] um you know
[2:06:23] if you if you don't have access to the
[2:06:26] messages of brother branham

[2:06:44] and you can put them on your phone and
[2:06:46] there's many other websites that you can
[2:06:48] go to actually and do this
[2:06:50] and uh you know where that you can have
[2:06:53] access to every
[2:06:54] every one of the sermons or you can you
[2:06:57] can actually
[2:06:59] you know stream one or you can
[2:07:01] download that one into your phone but
[2:07:03] anyway whatever you do feed on the word
[2:07:05] of god get your bible read the bible
[2:07:09] amen how many believes the bible
[2:07:12] oh you do well read it
[2:07:17] how do you know you believe it if you
[2:07:19] don't read it
[2:07:21] how can you show your believe it if you
[2:07:23] don't read it a lot of christians have
[2:07:25] never read their bible
[2:07:27] start somewhere
[2:07:29] with your experience
[2:07:31] feed on the word of god
[2:07:33] do it daily
[2:07:35] remember we are actually in passover
[2:07:38] it's not a ceremony that you do
[2:07:41] once a year like the jews did or the
[2:07:44] communion you do maybe once a month or
[2:07:47] however many times you do it at your
[2:07:49] church
[2:07:50] it's not it's a communion with the lord
[2:07:52] is not one once a month
[2:07:55] or twice a year
[2:07:57] it's every day with jesus
[2:07:59] and every day with jesus
[2:08:01] should be sweeter than the day before so
[2:08:04] grow in your experience with the lord
[2:08:06] and
[2:08:07] and pray
[2:08:08] call on the name of the lord
[2:08:10] and uh you know
[2:08:12] pray in the spirit get in the holy ghost
[2:08:14] the same holy ghost you you felt right
[2:08:17] here you can have it in your closet your
[2:08:20] experience every day
[2:08:23] every day
[2:08:24] and i want to stress that to you it's
[2:08:26] not just
[2:08:27] just a camp meeting experience and we
[2:08:29] wait till next year and we have another
[2:08:32] camp meeting experience and you just go
[2:08:34] from camp to camp to camp to camp
[2:08:36] it's more than that
[2:08:38] it's there where you're feeding daily on
[2:08:40] the word of god
[2:08:42] read the bible there's many bible apps
[2:08:47] biblegateway.com i think you know has a
[2:08:49] bible apps if you say well i'm not too
[2:08:52] great at reading well you can get it
[2:08:54] where
[2:08:55] you can
[2:08:56] right there on your on your phones
[2:08:59] or you get enough junk on it so why not
[2:09:01] get something good
[2:09:03] amen
[2:09:04] praise the lord
[2:09:10] but there's audio bibles on there
[2:09:13] and you can listen to them on the audio
[2:09:16] as you drive to work or you know as you
[2:09:19] as you stream something even going to
[2:09:21] school or at home or whatever you know
[2:09:24] just
[2:09:25] you know god's given us many tools in
[2:09:28] our hands we are without excuse
[2:09:32] when you think about the bible men
[2:09:34] died
[2:09:36] to be able to translate it into your
[2:09:39] language
[2:09:41] men died even even recently men went to
[2:09:45] prison
[2:09:47] in in china
[2:09:49] just sharing a king james version bible
[2:09:53] so i i'm not talking about now 200 years
[2:09:57] 500 years ago they did this and that i'm
[2:09:59] talking about right now
[2:10:01] so you know the word of god is precious
[2:10:05] and it should be very real it's but it's
[2:10:07] not rare it's not rare precious because
[2:10:09] we got it in abundance
[2:10:12] so there's so many supplemental things
[2:10:14] that you can do
[2:10:15] um you know so you know that that that
[2:10:18] has been that's a
[2:10:20] there when i was when i was a young man
[2:10:23] to hear i have every single sermon on
[2:10:26] brother branham's would cost me over ten
[2:10:28] thousand dollars you say wow that's a
[2:10:31] lot no that was a lot
[2:10:33] you know timothy cost me for his
[2:10:35] hospital bill 300
[2:10:37] 200 for the doctor so 500 i got a
[2:10:41] timothy
[2:10:45] kids were cheap back then
[2:10:49] but you know now they're they're not so
[2:10:52] cheap but now
[2:10:53] what i'm trying to say to you is that
[2:10:55] kind of gives you an idea
[2:10:59] but three tape libraries you could own
[2:11:02] and i'm not joking in in shreveport
[2:11:04] louisiana you could own a five bedroom
[2:11:07] house with three baths and a three-car
[2:11:10] garage
[2:11:12] in a nice neighborhood
[2:11:15] a car a truck would cost you
[2:11:19] three thousand dollars
[2:11:22] so
[2:11:23] and that's a brand new ford
[2:11:26] my dad bought one
[2:11:27] 1964. three thousand dollars
[2:11:30] so you know this this is now then
[2:11:33] a tape library ten thousand dollars
[2:11:37] you got it free
[2:11:46] it's available
[2:11:48] men died to get you a bible you got it
[2:11:51] free
[2:11:52] you don't have to die to get it
[2:11:57] so let's let's read the word of god
[2:11:59] let's feed on the word of god and feed
[2:12:01] your experience
