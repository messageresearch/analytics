[44:31] I want to bring something to you that's
[44:33] that's fresh or new to mine but the
[44:37] Lord's given me some inspiration to to
[44:39] speak to you today I the Lord had dealt
[44:42] with me a few weeks ago I was at a camp
[44:44] in Oklahoma and the Lord had dealt with
[44:46] me to speak on
[44:47] I'm a thought of worship Warriors
[44:49] and how many was in that camp there
[44:53] a few of you
[44:55] and I the Lord give me he give me some
[44:58] inspiration and uh
[45:00] and I just I'd like to speak to you
[45:02] today
[45:04] I was in this prayer line the Lord dealt
[45:06] with me what to speak to you this
[45:07] morning on worship without shackles
[45:11] worship without shackles and
[45:15] I feel like we've seen some shackles
[45:17] fall off and
[45:19] maybe if you have your Bible this
[45:21] morning we'll turn over to the Book of
[45:22] Revelation
[45:24] chapter one and then chapter five there
[45:28] you want to again thank brother Tim and
[45:30] evening like Tabernacle for inviting us
[45:33] to come and
[45:36] come and be a part of these meetings
[45:38] once again and
[45:39] it's an honor to
[45:46] it's an honor to stand here
[45:50] to watch my dad
[45:55] That was supposed to be in a grave by
[45:57] now
[46:00] foreign
[46:01] tell you that Easter is real
[46:06] so I believe that's why I can worship
[46:07] without shackles
[46:09] because Easter proved
[46:12] that the grave didn't have enough
[46:16] amen you love the Lord this morning
[46:21] before we read brother Brandon said in a
[46:22] restoration of the Bright Tree he said
[46:24] that's Easter time he said oh I like
[46:26] Easter yes sir but there's too much on
[46:28] Easter today about bunny rabbits and
[46:30] ducks and pink chickens and pretty hats
[46:33] and new dresses he said that's not
[46:34] Easter
[46:35] but Easter is the resurrection it's
[46:37] restoring to restore back its God
[46:40] restoring time it's God restoring time
[46:44] you look over you look out over the
[46:47] Earth God is restoring restoring what
[46:49] nature that's right he's restoring the
[46:51] flowers he's restoring the leaves he's
[46:53] restoring the fruit of the field what is
[46:55] it it's God is restoring it's Easter
[46:57] means to bring it back
[47:00] what is it there is a sentence Acclaim
[47:03] Easter crime
[47:04] or the flower claims it has a right to
[47:07] rise again and God's law nature pulls
[47:09] the Earth around and makes the law of
[47:10] God in nature bring forth an Easter a
[47:13] resurrection it's beautiful
[47:16] Revelations chapter 1 and verse 17.
[47:19] and when I saw him I fell at his feet
[47:23] as dead and he laid his right hand upon
[47:26] me saying unto me fear not I am the
[47:28] first and the last
[47:30] I am he that liveth and was dead dead
[47:33] and behold I Am Alive forevermore amen
[47:37] and I have the keys of hell and of death
[47:42] Revelations chapter 5 and verse 8.
[47:50] Revelations chapter 5 and verse 8 and
[47:52] brother Branham mother Branham said in
[47:54] Gabriel's instructions to Daniel he said
[47:56] I like to worship don't you
[47:59] and we don't come to church just to hear
[48:01] a sermon that goes with it but we come
[48:02] to church to worship Worship in spirit
[48:05] and in truth you've heard the truth
[48:07] that's the word now to worship is to
[48:10] express yourself to him
[48:13] and the Lord spoke to me a little bit
[48:15] ago and he spoke to me said
[48:17] laughs
[48:23] I've give you everything in life
[48:26] but worship is what we give back to him
[48:29] it's the only thing
[48:31] it's the only thing that he didn't give
[48:33] us that we can give back to him
[48:35] so let's give it back to him
[48:38] Revelations 5 and 8 and when he had
[48:40] taken the book The Four beasts and Four
[48:42] and Twenty Elders fell down before the
[48:43] lamb having every one of them Harps and
[48:45] golden vows full of odors which are the
[48:47] prayers of saints and they sung a new
[48:50] song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the
[48:52] book and to open the seals thereof for
[48:54] thou was slain and that's redeemed us to
[48:56] God by thy blood out of every Kindred
[48:59] and tongue and people and nation and
[49:02] that's made us unto our God the Kings
[49:04] and Priests let's say that together
[49:05] Kings and Priests and we shall reign on
[49:08] the earth and I beheld and I heard the
[49:10] voice of many angels round about the
[49:12] throne and the Beast and the elders and
[49:14] the number of them was ten thousands
[49:16] times ten thousands and thousands of
[49:18] thousands saying with a loud voice
[49:20] Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to
[49:22] receive power and riches and wisdom and
[49:25] strength and honor and glory and
[49:27] blessing and every creature which is in
[49:29] heaven and on Earth and under the Earth
[49:31] and such as are in the sea and all that
[49:33] are in them heard I saying blessing and
[49:37] honor and Glory free and power be unto
[49:39] him that setteth upon the throne and the
[49:42] lamb forever and ever and the four
[49:45] beasts said amen and the Four and Twenty
[49:47] Elders fell down and worshiped him that
[49:50] liveth forever
[49:52] and ever may God bless his word he may
[49:55] be seated in the presence of the Lord as
[49:56] we said we'd like to speak to you just
[49:58] for a few moments this morning on
[50:00] worship without shackles worship without
[50:02] shelters and Jesus said that he said the
[50:05] hour cometh and now is when the true
[50:08] worshipers shall worship the father in
[50:10] spirit and in the truth for the father
[50:13] seeketh such to worship him so we
[50:15] recognize that God is a spirit and they
[50:18] that worship Him have got to worship Him
[50:21] in spirit and in truth and you know good
[50:24] and well that that we serve an amazing
[50:26] God that has filled your life has
[50:28] changed your mind he's he's changed your
[50:30] heart he's changed you he's healed you
[50:32] he's made you whole and he knows how to
[50:35] speak to us upon our current life crisis
[50:37] that we are in and he doesn't speak to
[50:39] us about our problems but he speak to us
[50:42] about his promises and he knows exactly
[50:44] where we are and he knows exactly where
[50:46] he is taking us to he's not taking us
[50:49] under defeat but he is taking us under
[50:51] complete Victory and he reveals himself
[50:54] in truth so that he can be worshiped in
[50:56] truth so today we are not serving a God
[50:58] that has lied to us and has ever let
[51:00] down on any of his promises but we are
[51:03] worship him a God that knows that he's
[51:05] going to keep his promise he knows that
[51:08] he's not going to let one of them fall
[51:09] and we recognize that we are serving a
[51:12] tangible God a God that can be failed a
[51:14] God that can be seen a God that you've
[51:16] witnessed and you've witnessed him come
[51:19] and touch you this weekend by the power
[51:21] of the Holy Ghost it was him and it came
[51:24] by your way and he touched your heart
[51:25] he's a tangible God and it can be felt
[51:28] by the feeling of our infirmities but I
[51:30] don't want to just talk to you about
[51:32] things of of things that that you've
[51:34] went through and things of your past but
[51:36] I want to speak to you from people that
[51:38] have the keys in their hand and have
[51:41] unlocked the chains off of their life

[51:44] message of Jeremiah 8 and 22 is there is
[51:47] there any balm and Gilead is there no

[55:51] amen amen amen do you believe that you
[55:56] beat all the shackles off of your
[55:59] understanding

[56:04] one thing in your way but you believe
[56:06] you're free
[56:08] you believe you're free you believe all

[56:35] defeated I will not go to a devil's
[56:37] grave I will not go to his hell hole no
[56:40] more
[56:41] you cannot worship from where you was
[56:43] last week you've got to worship from the
[56:46] experience that you had in this Camp
[56:48] you've got to worship free you've got to
[56:51] worship when shackles off of you
[56:53] you can't worship when there's change on
[56:55] your life you can't sing thank God I'm
[56:58] free as long as the chains are upon you
[57:00] but if the chains are off
[57:02] the shackles have been broke you are
[57:05] worshiping from freedom and there is
[57:08] nobody that can worship like somebody
[57:10] that's been set free because there's a
[57:13] reason why you can sing you don't know
[57:15] like I know because you were the one
[57:17] that was locked up you were the one that
[57:19] the devil lied to and you recognize that
[57:22] he ain't got his hand on you no more
[57:23] you're free and then the sun is set free
[57:28] his friend paid we're not going back to
[57:31] our chains we're not going back to our
[57:33] prison cell we're not going back to it
[57:35] because our lord Jesus came with the
[57:38] keys in his hand
[57:40] The Keeper of the keys is here
[57:50] tell the devil you ain't got the keys to
[57:52] your own house
[57:54] you can't lock me up in there no more
[57:56] you can't lock me up in that prison cell
[57:59] you can't put me back in that turtle's
[58:01] hell you can't put me back there where
[58:02] you held me I know what it's like to be
[58:05] free and if you ever tasted a sweet
[58:08] taste of Victory you'll never go back to
[58:11] living a bad life no more
[58:14] hallelujah we're not ashamed we know
[58:17] when we came out of and the same God
[58:19] that came there and tapped Peter on the
[58:22] sale when he was there in the prison
[58:24] cell was the same God that came to you
[58:26] this weekend and said it's time that you
[58:28] rise and shine
[58:30] because there was prayer made up there
[58:31] at John Mark's house and they were
[58:33] praying for brother Peter they were
[58:35] praying for him and while they were
[58:37] praying for him the angel that was
[58:39] directed by prayer went to Peter's
[58:42] prison
[58:42] notice a prayer didn't send him down
[58:45] over to Lucy's house or Susie's house
[58:47] but he sent him to Peter's house and
[58:49] there were some mamas that was praying
[58:51] there were some pastors that was praying
[58:53] and the angel came and woke you up
[58:56] and said it's time to get out of your
[58:58] shackles and it's time to worship you
[59:00] cannot look at the chains you cannot
[59:03] look at where you was you've got to look
[59:05] at where God is going to take you David
[59:07] could not look at Goliath's head because
[59:10] he was looking at the promises of God
[59:14] the promises of God are so big that you
[59:16] can't even see that washed tub of a
[59:18] Giant's head because he know you know
[59:21] that God ain't never lost about
[59:23] can I just talk to you for a moment
[59:25] God's never lost a battle
[59:28] God's not intentioning he's not in the
[59:30] having any tensions that he's going to
[59:32] lose today if he won the victory two
[59:34] thousand years ago he's going to win the
[59:36] victory this morning
[59:38] is that right
[59:41] I will not go back to a devil's hell I
[59:45] will not go back to depression
[59:48] let's make some affirmations here this
[59:51] morning I will not go back to my prison
[59:53] house I will not go back to that dark
[59:55] cloud spirit I will not go back to that
[59:58] fear I will not go back to that
[1:00:00] mentality I will not go back to a slave
[1:00:03] mentality
[1:00:04] come on somebody you can sing that song
[1:00:07] I would not be denied
[1:00:13] when Pains of death She's On My Soul
[1:00:16] unto the Lord I cried till Jesus came
[1:00:21] and he made me whole I would not beating
[1:00:26] heart

[1:00:44] said when those little shackles and Dark
[1:00:45] Shadows get broke away then the Holy

[1:03:46] delivered I'm no longer a pound yes and
[1:03:49] William Branham said he said when
[1:03:50] there's one that he said one one says
[1:03:53] yes there's the power of one but when
[1:03:55] two say yes it's a power of two he said
[1:03:57] it's a double blessing then now we're
[1:03:59] free then the power of four yeses but
[1:04:02] all if all of this building could say
[1:04:04] yes it's mine
[1:04:06] I am delivered yes
[1:04:10] yes it's passing through this room right
[1:04:13] now this ain't Titan's time this ain't
[1:04:16] Putin's time this ain't bad in time this
[1:04:19] is our time the time is at hand this is
[1:04:21] the bright survival this is the Golden
[1:04:24] Age the shackles are rolled off of you
[1:04:28] remember when William Branham because
[1:04:30] they're in a prayer line in his early
[1:04:31] Ministry
[1:04:33] and it's there in a foreign land and
[1:04:35] there's a little girl that is sitting
[1:04:36] there it's got these braces on her leg
[1:04:39] remember she's sitting there she's
[1:04:40] waiting and brother Branham he's passing
[1:04:42] by
[1:04:44] and children have a very special spot
[1:04:46] there's there's never a child that I've
[1:04:48] ever prayed for and I could ever forget
[1:04:51] them
[1:04:52] children have a very special spot in our
[1:04:54] hearts
[1:04:55] but this little girl was sitting there
[1:04:57] and had these braces upon her leg
[1:04:59] she's sitting there
[1:05:01] as brother Brandon passed by she reached
[1:05:04] up and kissed his coat you remember she
[1:05:07] reached up and she kissed his coat and
[1:05:10] brother Branham said he said I turned
[1:05:11] around to her and said you're healed he
[1:05:13] said a vision broke and he said I've
[1:05:15] seen that she was healed he said but she
[1:05:18] couldn't understand me because of the
[1:05:20] language barrier
[1:05:22] because of the language barrier and he
[1:05:25] said they took me immediately he said in
[1:05:27] that night there was Miracle on top of
[1:05:28] Miracles he said they grabbed crutches
[1:05:30] armed full of crutches and they took
[1:05:32] them out of there but you see the vision
[1:05:34] had already spoke and the vision had got
[1:05:38] to come to pass because a vision can
[1:05:40] never fail you recognize that she'd come
[1:05:43] there with that Faith she reached out
[1:05:45] and she kissed the prophets coattail
[1:05:47] there as he passed by but the vision had
[1:05:49] already broke
[1:05:51] and maybe you don't understand because
[1:05:53] the language barrier maybe there's a
[1:05:56] laodicea barrier that's trying to keep
[1:05:59] you thinking that you're going to go
[1:06:00] back to that
[1:06:02] but a vision has already broke God's
[1:06:05] language is not that you go back God's
[1:06:08] language is that you be free
[1:06:12] William Branham said that he was sitting
[1:06:14] there and he was speaking through that
[1:06:15] interpreter and he said you only say
[1:06:17] what I say he said honey you are already
[1:06:21] healed
[1:06:23] said you go over there and you take
[1:06:25] those braces off and when those braces
[1:06:28] come off just raise your hand up and
[1:06:31] when you raise your hand up
[1:06:34] fathers
[1:06:38] oh why don't you lift up those hands
[1:06:40] that once held lower the feeble hands at
[1:06:43] once hung down you are not in shekels no
[1:06:45] more
[1:06:46] and when she lifted up her hand he said
[1:06:49] I heard a scream
[1:06:53] he said there she come running across
[1:06:56] that platform
[1:06:58] what was it the braces had come off the
[1:07:01] shackles had come off why don't you lift
[1:07:03] those hands you that's been set free
[1:07:05] you're that's been delivered
[1:07:08] why don't you let out a screamer said I
[1:07:10] am free I am to live first I am broke
[1:07:13] free that's not a language barrier
[1:07:15] between you and Papa God
[1:07:17] you know what he's saying to you
[1:07:22] God's language
[1:07:25] God's language used to throw down every
[1:07:27] devil
[1:07:28] his language is the cast down every evil
[1:07:30] spirit his language is to throw down
[1:07:32] Idols his language is that you be fret
[1:07:35] set free but his language is not just
[1:07:38] for the personal things that you'd have
[1:07:40] made of his language is for a Rapture
[1:07:42] let me tell you if we don't go into
[1:07:44] Rapture this message is no good to us
[1:07:47] but if this message is wrong then all
[1:07:51] Christianity is wrong
[1:07:53] the angel is here to back up what the
[1:07:55] message has said the language of the
[1:07:58] angels of the Angel is you are returned
[1:08:01] back
[1:08:04] he didn't give you a message of has
[1:08:05] frustration he gave you a message of
[1:08:08] full restoration you're not under a
[1:08:10] Luther worship you're not under a
[1:08:12] Wesleyan worship you're not under Azusa
[1:08:15] worship you are under the greatest
[1:08:17] restoration message that there ever has
[1:08:19] been ever Every Chain has been broke off
[1:08:22] of it
[1:08:23] you're not worshiping from a closed book
[1:08:26] you're worshiping from an open book The
[1:08:28] Seals have been broke off our
[1:08:30] understanding is open we recognize the
[1:08:32] seals have been ripped off
[1:08:34] every devil that said he was going to
[1:08:37] destroy us is a liar
[1:08:40] the white horse rider that was riding in
[1:08:42] Revelations 5 we recognize that he is
[1:08:45] powerless
[1:08:47] you see because of our understanding of
[1:08:49] theologians they told us that that was
[1:08:51] our Lord up there riding on that white
[1:08:53] horse but when the seal broke forth
[1:08:56] he gave us an understanding that that
[1:08:58] was the Antichrist writing on that but
[1:09:00] what did William reading tell us he's
[1:09:02] riding a pair he's got a bow but he
[1:09:05] ain't got no arrows so the weapons that
[1:09:07] he's throwing at you have no effect on
[1:09:09] you because your sword and your Shield
[1:09:12] of faith
[1:09:14] but is it you're not worshiping from a
[1:09:16] closed mentality
[1:09:21] there are certain people here
[1:09:23] that have an understanding
[1:09:26] you could put a Luther in this building
[1:09:28] you could put a Wesleyan in this
[1:09:29] building and they wouldn't understand
[1:09:31] what we're talking about but because
[1:09:32] there has been a barrier that has been
[1:09:35] broken all of the things have been
[1:09:37] ripped off of your mentality you can no
[1:09:40] longer think from the mentality of a
[1:09:42] closed book let me tell you once you see
[1:09:44] it you can never unsee it
[1:09:47] because God when he gives a revelation
[1:09:49] there might be intellectualism that will
[1:09:52] come and it might raise up to a certain
[1:09:54] standard but it'll only take you forward
[1:09:56] so far but Revelation never ends
[1:09:59] and what God has given you is not just
[1:10:02] some mental theology or an
[1:10:04] intellectualism he has given you a faith
[1:10:06] or Revelation to accept that the whole
[1:10:08] word is given unto you and every devil
[1:10:11] is trying to keep you from this
[1:10:13] you see there's a lot of people that can
[1:10:15] worship and say that they're worshiping
[1:10:17] but only you can worship like the father
[1:10:20] wants you to worship because you are the
[1:10:23] Queen of Heaven and there's nobody that
[1:10:25] can praise
[1:10:26] like you can praise there's nobody that
[1:10:29] can worship like you can worship job
[1:10:32] when he was in his worst of Trials he
[1:10:35] got up in Job chapter one then job arose
[1:10:39] he tore his robe and he shaved his head
[1:10:41] and he fell on the ground and he
[1:10:43] worshiped there's going to have to come
[1:10:45] a time in your life when you don't feel
[1:10:47] like worshiping that you have to worship
[1:10:49] so David said in Psalms 95 oh come let
[1:10:53] us sing unto the Lord and let us Make a
[1:10:56] Joyful Noise to the rock of our
[1:10:58] salvation
[1:10:59] let us come before his presence with
[1:11:01] Thanksgiving and Make a Joyful Noise
[1:11:03] unto him with Psalms Psalms 100
[1:11:06] and Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord
[1:11:09] all you lands serve the Lord with
[1:11:11] gladness
[1:11:13] come before his presence with singing
[1:11:21] Exodus 15.
[1:11:24] then saying Moses and the children of
[1:11:27] Israel this song unto the Lord and
[1:11:29] speaks saying I will sing to the Lord
[1:11:32] for he have triumphed gloriously the
[1:11:34] horse and the rider hath he thrown into
[1:11:36] the sea judges five and three hear o you
[1:11:40] Kings give ear o you princess ah even I
[1:11:43] will sing it to the Lord I will sing
[1:11:45] praise to the Lord God of Israel first
[1:11:47] chronicles 16 and 23 singing to the Lord
[1:11:50] all the Earth so forth from day to day
[1:11:53] his salvation
[1:11:55] not just week into weekend and night
[1:11:58] just came to Camp day to day his
[1:12:00] salvation Psalms 13 and 6 I will sing
[1:12:03] unto the Lord because he has dealt
[1:12:05] bountifully with me Psalms 30 and 4 sing
[1:12:07] unto the Lord O ye Saints of his and
[1:12:10] give thanks at the remembrance of his
[1:12:12] Holiness Psalm 66 and 1 Make a Joyful
[1:12:15] Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands Psalms
[1:12:18] 81 and 1 sing aloud unto God our
[1:12:21] strength Make a Joyful Noise unto the
[1:12:23] god of Jacob Psalms 95 Oh Come and Let
[1:12:27] us sing it to the Lord let us Make a
[1:12:29] Joyful Noise
[1:12:31] not a mournful noise but a Joyful Noise
[1:12:34] to the rock of our Salvation Psalms 96
[1:12:37] of singing to the Lord a new song
[1:12:44] let me go ahead and get one
[1:12:45] ecclesiastical devil right here while
[1:12:47] I'm here
[1:12:48] they say we shouldn't be singing these
[1:12:50] new style of worship songs
[1:12:53] but the Bible says Sing a new song
[1:12:58] everywhere I go I hear devils in my ear
[1:13:01] telling us that we should not be singing
[1:13:03] that song he is here and he is our
[1:13:06] Waymaker that song way maker has had
[1:13:09] more trouble than any other song that
[1:13:11] we're singing right now
[1:13:13] because people say that we're not
[1:13:15] singing that we're just singing that to
[1:13:17] anybody but we're not just singing that
[1:13:19] to anybody
[1:13:21] we're singing that to Jesus people say
[1:13:24] well you could be singing that to the
[1:13:25] cardboard you could be singing that too
[1:13:27] you could see singing that to anybody
[1:13:29] but we're not singing that song just
[1:13:31] anybody
[1:13:34] he's here
[1:13:35] even when you don't see him he's working
[1:13:37] even when you don't feel him he's
[1:13:39] working
[1:13:41] I'm not singing my song through a dead
[1:13:44] God I'm singing my song to a god that's
[1:13:47] a Waymaker that's a promise keeper
[1:13:49] that's a devil Destroyer that raises up
[1:13:52] early on Sunday morning
[1:13:54] and if he said sing I'm gonna sing
[1:13:58] [Applause]
[1:14:00] Psalms 98 I'll sing it to the Lord a new
[1:14:03] song for he hath done marvelous well
[1:14:06] therefore Unleashed try to mock you and
[1:14:08] make fun of you are there you still
[1:14:10] gotta Praise Him
[1:14:11] God wants somebody that'll praise him no
[1:14:15] matter what they're going through no
[1:14:17] matter what they're feeling
[1:14:20] God has appointed you to sing
[1:14:26] He Knows Your Song
[1:14:29] and only you can sing it
[1:14:33] there's power in your song
[1:14:35] there's power in your praise
[1:14:37] it's well I don't really have a very
[1:14:39] good voice let me tell you your voice
[1:14:41] is sweet to him
[1:14:45] he don't care how much talent you got he
[1:14:48] wants your heart
[1:14:49] come on somebody he don't care if you
[1:14:52] can carry a tune in a bucket he wants
[1:14:54] your heart salt
[1:14:58] too long too many times people had put
[1:15:01] their Harps upon the willow tree
[1:15:06] because the enemy had spread itself
[1:15:08] forth like a Green Bay Tree and it
[1:15:10] looked like they were prospering more
[1:15:11] than the righteous
[1:15:13] but you have got to get your heart down
[1:15:15] off the willow tree stop crying about it
[1:15:18] stop being in pity stop thinking every
[1:15:20] it's everybody else's fault and start
[1:15:22] worshiping
[1:15:25] God wants worship and if it's going to
[1:15:28] be worshiped then we ought to do it
[1:15:30] according to the Bible we ought to
[1:15:32] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:15:34] you're not worshiping him from an
[1:15:37] experience of Moses you're not
[1:15:38] worshiping him from Paul's experience
[1:15:40] you're worshiping him from your
[1:15:42] experience
[1:15:44] you know that the Bible tells us that
[1:15:45] when Jehoshaphat had went a player that
[1:15:48] Jehoshaphat when the enemy the multitude
[1:15:50] that came in against him that the
[1:15:51] multitude went in there and they come on
[1:15:54] and they spread all around the children
[1:15:56] of Israel and Jehoshaphat he went up
[1:15:59] there where did he go
[1:16:01] do his self-pity
[1:16:04] do his problems
[1:16:06] to his struggles absolutely not he went
[1:16:08] to the house of the Lord and when he
[1:16:11] went to the house of the Lord he went up
[1:16:13] there and called a fast over all of
[1:16:14] Israel and he caught up there and notice
[1:16:17] what the Lord when the Lord become a
[1:16:19] player and he met with Jehoshaphat he
[1:16:22] commanded a feast a fast be over top of
[1:16:24] all of the land of Israel and when they
[1:16:26] got up there God spoke to him and said
[1:16:29] this is my battle
[1:16:32] you see this is not just your battle
[1:16:34] this is God's battle and when it feels
[1:16:37] like you are all alone God is saying her
[1:16:39] and he says you're not even going to
[1:16:41] have to fight in this battle this is my
[1:16:43] battle and I'm going to fight for you
[1:16:45] but he gave Jehoshaphat instructions and
[1:16:49] he told him to go up there and appoint
[1:16:51] singers and praisers to praise him in
[1:16:54] the beauty of his holiness
[1:16:57] and when he brought them up there notice
[1:17:00] here's all of these multitudes in there
[1:17:02] all of them multitudes are in there all
[1:17:04] of them enemies are in there I want you
[1:17:06] to think about the enemy that you fought
[1:17:08] till you got here all of them enemies
[1:17:10] are lined up out there and here
[1:17:13] Jehoshaphat appointed singers and he
[1:17:16] appointed singers to go over there and
[1:17:18] they started singing and when they begin
[1:17:20] to sing aloud that the Bible tells us
[1:17:23] that they begin to shout and praise the
[1:17:25] Lord that the Bible said that the Lord
[1:17:27] said ambushments upon their adversaries
[1:17:31] the Bible if you go to studying that out
[1:17:33] it means to lie in wait so God was there
[1:17:37] before their praise ever got out
[1:17:41] before you ever broke out God was
[1:17:44] already there before you accepted your
[1:17:46] Liberty God was already Fair
[1:17:49] before you set yourself before God sets
[1:17:52] you free you God was already there
[1:17:55] and the Bible tells us if you really go
[1:17:57] to setting out the Bible says if you go
[1:18:00] to studying out that ambushment it means
[1:18:02] to bring a confusion
[1:18:05] their praise was so loud that it
[1:18:08] confused those devils and them Devils
[1:18:11] turned on themselves and defeated
[1:18:13] themselves can you imagine the anxiety
[1:18:16] and the depression that you fought
[1:18:20] start taking their own swords
[1:18:23] and start slitting there on long necks
[1:18:26] that's exactly what's going to happen in
[1:18:28] the battle of Armageddon those demons
[1:18:30] are going to turn on one another
[1:18:32] what is it anxiety turned on depression
[1:18:35] fear turned on suicide and they
[1:18:37] destroyed themselves let your praise
[1:18:40] bring out a confusion
[1:18:42] you cannot separate war from worship
[1:18:45] because Judah means praise and every
[1:18:47] time you go into battle you've got to
[1:18:49] have some worship
[1:18:52] you have been elected overcome you've
[1:18:54] been elected to win the battle
[1:18:56] but you're not worshiping David you're
[1:18:59] not worshiping David from a body that's
[1:19:03] not been anointed you're anointed for
[1:19:05] this
[1:19:06] you're elected for this
[1:19:11] but you're going to go back to your home
[1:19:15] and the anointing is going to be on you
[1:19:18] things might look the same you might go
[1:19:21] back to the same seat fold you might go
[1:19:23] back to the same Mountain you might go
[1:19:25] back to the same church but the
[1:19:27] anointing is there
[1:19:30] when the prophet poured out the
[1:19:32] anointing he didn't come there and wipe
[1:19:34] it off of him he poured it over him and
[1:19:37] when he poured the anointing oil upon
[1:19:39] your life the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:42] he didn't come and take it away from you
[1:19:44] he sealed your faith
[1:19:50] let me know
[1:19:52] you know the Bible tells us
[1:19:55] the Bible tells us
[1:19:57] that there was no holy ghost at that
[1:19:59] time
[1:19:59] is that right there was no holy ghost at
[1:20:02] that time but when Saul was tormented by
[1:20:04] them Devils up there you remember that
[1:20:06] they called for a worshiper
[1:20:10] because worship drives away spirits
[1:20:15] it matters what you're listening to it
[1:20:17] matters what you're doing and they
[1:20:20] called little bitty old David up there
[1:20:22] because the prophet said in those days
[1:20:25] he said there was no divide there was no
[1:20:27] healing there so there was no Divine
[1:20:29] Healing he said but David was a Divine
[1:20:31] healer by music and David drove out
[1:20:35] Spirits by music
[1:20:38] so it matters what you're playing David
[1:20:40] wasn't up here playing some rock and
[1:20:42] roll and he wasn't playing some AC DC he
[1:20:44] was playing the Lord as my shipper and I
[1:20:47] shall not vote yea though I walked to
[1:20:49] the Valley of the shadow of death I
[1:20:51] won't fear no evil the Lord is my light
[1:20:54] the Lord is my salvation the Lord is my
[1:20:57] rock he has enlarged my foots that I
[1:21:00] would not fall
[1:21:06] there's nobody that can play your hearts
[1:21:08] like you
[1:21:09] and David's playing his harp that's Saul
[1:21:13] begins to fill his Spirit renewed
[1:21:16] because of worship
[1:21:19] but Saul
[1:21:21] Saul had turned his face away from God
[1:21:25] but David was raised under the anointing
[1:21:28] for such an hour as this and David
[1:21:31] brought healing by music
[1:21:34] if there was healing by music thee and
[1:21:36] there's healing by music now there's too
[1:21:38] many people that's wanting to kick music
[1:21:40] out of the church but it was when music
[1:21:42] was played it went a lie to us a player
[1:21:44] and he was Miffy that there is when the
[1:21:47] spirit of the Lord Came Upon Elijah when
[1:21:49] he grabbed the menstrual and the
[1:21:51] menstrual was played so if God like
[1:21:53] music then God likes music now and
[1:21:56] there's nobody the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:21:59] has got the best worship she's got the

[1:41:45] [Music]
[1:41:47] reminds me
[1:41:50] it reminds me

[1:41:54] the Lord came when Solomon was built in
[1:41:56] the temple and the congregation couldn't
[1:41:57] hit her because the presence of the Lord
[1:41:58] is so strong but it also reminds me
[1:42:02] when I Prophet was over there in Africa
[1:42:06] Saul them heathens packing their idols
[1:42:12] and they were carrying that just in case
[1:42:14] that the god
[1:42:16] of the Bible couldn't keep them so they
[1:42:18] was packing this by packing his Idol
[1:42:20] around
[1:42:22] another Brandon watched them packing
[1:42:24] that idle into that meeting and you
[1:42:26] remember how the prophet stood there
[1:42:28] was that blind man he was dealing with
[1:42:31] he'd been entertained by the religions
[1:42:34] of the world that day
[1:42:37] he said if any of your Gods can heal him
[1:42:39] come up here
[1:42:41] he said but if Jesus Is Our Lord why
[1:42:43] don't you throw down your
[1:42:47] and when that boy was healed brother
[1:42:49] Bynum said there was such a dust storm
[1:42:52] because they had threw down their idols
[1:42:54] this presence reminds me there has been
[1:42:57] some Idols that threw down this weekend
[1:42:59] I don't say you picked up I don't say
[1:43:02] you created but your worship shows that
[1:43:06] them Idols have no hold on you no more
