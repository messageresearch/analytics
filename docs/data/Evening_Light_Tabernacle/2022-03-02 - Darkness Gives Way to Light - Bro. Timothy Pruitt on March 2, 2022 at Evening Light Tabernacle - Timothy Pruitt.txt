are being hit in this time amen and those right here in our own area the evening light would shine to our community stronger than ever amen if you would come open the service for us [Music] as we take these knees to the lord let's just remember brother ron with cancer sister erica parker with cancer i believe there's a sister there in canada who's on the desk door with cancer we have sister ruth wilson and brother ross with cancer but as i was in devotion this morning just praying the lord just reminded me he said not even cancer and i was like lord where did that come from you know so when we hear cancer immediately we're stricken with fear anxiety and we can take that as a fear complex a fear anxiety stress depression all forms because cancer has all forms there's cancer small and aggressive their cancer is big and mild and meek and it goes away but no matter what he said not even cancer and cancer was the greatest threat in that day and he said not even the greatest threat so whatever you're facing this this evening whatever you're going through whether it be physical whether it be spiritual just remember not even cancer can stand before your prayer and notice it wasn't a prophet that said it but it was the angel the lord told the prophet if you can get the people to believe you can elevate their faith and they can grab hold of this word and believe it for themselves not even cancer will stand before their prayer you will have your petition met and i believe he's as much god tonight as he was in now we got needs in the body and we're believers and we're going to pray for those needs and there is we got brothers and sisters in the ukraine right now that are suffering huddled up in a basement freezing cold because now an enemy has decided to attack their land but he gave us a promise not even cancer not even russia not even the greatest enemy can can destroy the purpose of god so let's just take these knees tonight in prayer and believe father we just bow our hearts before you tonight and lord we're so thankful that you have given us this revealed word lord it's much more than just words that are pinned on a paper it's much more than voice on a tape god this is a living reality we have seen manifested in our day this very word the very essence of christ living and breathing through men and women and we're thankful father that we have seen our name on the book we recognize who we are we recognize you have given us the authority through the word to be able to speak these things and not even cancer will stand before our prayer father we don't speak these things as humans lord because our human voice will only go so far but as oracles of god as instruments of righteousness lord we speak to the cancer that's afflicted ron spencer erica parker ruth wilson ross oglesby and many or lord we tell that cancer to leave right now in the name of jesus christ because we have been commissioned we have been given the authority to use the word of god and lord we speak these things as the sons and daughters of god tonight and we believe that cancer has to leave tonight we believe that ron spence is going to get his rest and cancer no more attack his body we're going to believe tonight lord that ruth wilson will receive her deliverance from cancer tonight erica parker also calls me father and many more we believe because you have given us a word of promise and lord we hold you to that promise tonight for it's not man's word it's your word and the prophet of god would teach us that you're obligated to the word and lord nothing will defeat your purpose and we are the very heart purpose of god and we're asking tonight lord for the movement of the spirit even now father in the ukraine go forth over there father may your holy spirit brood over the believers and bring an arm of protection to them god keep the bombs away keep the rubble away keep the destruction away god protect your people hide them under the shadow of your wings now father may you keep them during this difficult struggle difficult time lord we see what the enemy is after but you said not even cancer not even the greatest threat in that day and not even the greatest threat in this day can defeat our prayer so father on the wings of our prayer tonight we pray you'd go forth move in power and in manifestation use brother timothy tonight father we ask these things now in jesus name amen [Music] amen why don't we just give the lord a handclap [Applause] amen these are troubling days aren't they but these are the days of elijah amen and behold he comes aren't you glad about that amen these are the days of elijah [Music] oh these are days of great trials [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] is [Music] [Music] oh [Music] these are the days of your service

believers lord has been bombed today in missiles flying all around them and bullets god let your angels just protect them lord during this time we pray or do we commit this to you this time to you and your hands in jesus name amen amen amen let's turn to psalms chapter 27 in verse 1. amen psalms chapter 27 and verse 1. you know this to be the rapture text that brother branham would take for the sermon the rapture psalms 27 verse 1 the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came upon me to eat my up my flesh they stumbled and failed the host should encamp about me my heart shall not fear and though war shall rise against me and this will i be confident one thing have i desired the lord that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion and the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock amen let you be seated this evening like to speak to you on darkness gives way to light darkness gives away to light i you know it's quite an interesting [Music] uh scripture that brother branham would take for the rapture i believe it was of course directed of god that he would take these these few words that david would write and he would begin to speak about the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear because i believe that i believe god knew that we would have plenty to fear in this time that we're living in i i believe he knew there would be plenty of darkness in this time that we're living in i believe he knew that we would have to have strength for the time that we're living in amen i believe he knew there would be the wicked there would be enemies there would be foes there would be cancers there would be covert there would be every kind of disease amen that would try to come up and eat your flesh but they stumbled and fell i i believe he knew that there would be a host that would try to encamp against the bride of jesus christ but yet in all of that my heart shall not fear and war would even rise against us but we would still have a confidence in him amen that i believe it's a wonderful thing for there to be still be a people or be of a people that has confidence in our god that no matter how bad it is or how difficult it is amen we haven't lost one one iota of confidence in him but we know that he has the answer amen for every situation and i i believe he knew there would be people that would desire and would seek after him in the time that we're living in amen that they would dwell in the house of the lord all the days of their life amen i believe that he knew that there would be a time of trouble and during this time of trouble he would have a pavilion or a secret place a tabernacle that we could hide in i believe that he would also know that he would need a rock that was a firm foundation that we could stand upon amen he knew amen the atmosphere that it would be around the time of exodus he knew the time that we were living in the situation the darkness all around us you know i find it very interesting that there's more people than ever having severe mind battles there's more people than ever dealing with suicidal thoughts there's more fear than there's ever been and amen we've had more advancement in science and more advancement in technologies but in all of our our greatness of humanity amen it hasn't done has been it's produced more thoughts were our bad thoughts and suicidal thoughts and and mind battles and fears and and perplexities and darkness and confusion wars and rumors of wars amen we're living in a very difficult time but it's also a very wonderful time amen it's the very moment it's the very time of the coming of the lord amen you know as we think about the time we're living in i was sent this by brother mike today a man was apologizing to his wife for having to raise children in the time of great trouble that we're in and the wife responded with a quote she had read earlier that day said never feel sorry for raising dragon slayers in a time when there are actual dragons hallelujah i i believe in all of this we don't have to feel sorry for raising children of the light when there's actual darkness that we're facing we don't have to feel sorry for raising sons and daughters who will stand and defy the darkness that are around us amen sons that will raise up and slay giants amen i think about moses his mom and dad no doubt thought it was a bad time maybe for a child to be born but god had a purpose for his life amen maybe david's mama thought it was a bad time for david to be born but god had a purpose for david's life amen i believe that even though you may think it's a bad time and a bad time to raise children god has a people amen that's going to raise up and slay every demon of sickness slaver demon of depression i believe there's men that's going to be raised up in the time that we're living in that's going to defy every dark spirit upon this earth that's going to defy the suicidal spot of suicidal mind battles that's trying to take the mind of men and the mind of women but there's going to be daughters of god that'll raise up and defy fear amen defy anxiety defy every spirit of hell hallelujah amen we need dragon slayers when there's actual dragons around we need men and daughters and sons of god that are raised up in the power of god and defy the devils that are trying to infiltrate this time that we're living in him amen i believe that even in the moments that we're looking at there's men and women that are raised up for such a time as this amen there was a church hill that was raised up amen for a certain time there was an eisenhower that was raised up for a certain time it was you can go through men of history that were raised up for a certain time amen don't leave yourself out you were raised up for this time you were raised up for this moment amen not to be just a young person going through life as if nothing has happened but with a purpose amen the purpose of of leaving this place of defying every work of darkness and raising up into the light amen we can see even the hebrew children maybe their moms and their dads thought it might have been a bad time to have children during their day in daniel but daniel and those men were raised up for a certain purpose amen daniel would speak about the time that we're living in daniel 12 and verse 1. it says at that time shall michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never since was since there was a nation even to that same time but at that time thy people shall be hallelujah shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book hallelujah and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall wake some to everlasting life some to shame and everlasting contempt and they that be wise shall shine shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever amen i actually wore the clothes that i wore tonight on purpose amen i thought i wore a white shirt or some other color these colors this white would not have stood up quite as great but in the middle of the black all around the black pants and the black shirt you can see every white stripe hallelujah you can see every every cut across there amen and what is happening god is such a has such a he's orchestrated this time that we're living in them in such darkness that you can see every white light you can see every child of god you can see every son of god that's rising up against the darkness and screaming out it shall be light in the evening time in the middle of darkness light comes to dispel the darkness so god begins to fulfill his word and in fulfilling his word it might look dark but light is breaking amen psalms 119 and 105 says thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path so the word being fulfilled actually gives light to you amen it gives light psalms 119 and 130 says the entrance of thy words giveth light it giveth understanding to the simple you know when it tries it might as we've read i've said said this many times the last few few few services tries it might darkness can't stop it darkness wars will not stop prophecy from phil being fulfilled amen demons cannot stop prophecy from being fulfilled darkness will not stop light but prophecy will be fulfilled amen as we read the scripture this quote over here last last service but i'll read it again from this time on especially through the dark ages we'll see the children of flesh persecute and destroy the children of the spirit even they both claim one father even as it was a case of ishmael and isaac the darkness of spiritual corruption will deepen and the true light of god will fade until number wise it grows ever so faintly yet the promise of god will hold true that the light shineth in darkness and darkness can do nothing about it hallelujah amen it's dark but look to the light it's dark but look to the one who can produce the light amen it's dark amen but look up our redemption is drawing near hallelujah i ran across this scripture i don't know if i've ever read it before but ecclesiastes 11 verse 7 says truly the light is sweet and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun you know how it is you know we just come through a few days of great dreariness i i i'm just going to tell you i couldn't live in a place like that there was dreary all the time and rainy all the time and cloudy all the time amen you know we went through about four five six days what it was of of sun not seeing the sun for a long time i don't know about you but i'm about sick of this amen i like the sun i don't like the dreariness and then you know depression starts setting in and feelings of dread and frustration when the sun is not present can you imagine amen a world that's sitting and not in darkness and not knowing christ not ever seeing him moving a service not ever seeing him move in their lives and not ever seeing him or witnessing moving the power of his resurrection all you you know all you have is what he was twenty or two 000 years ago but the sun hasn't risen in their life to dispel the darkness it means nothing but gloominess there's nothing but frustration no wonder the world is groping around no wonder the world and men's hearts are failing for fear they haven't seen the sun but there it don't mean the sun's not there hallelujah brother branham was talking about the sun rising on a certain day at the emancipation proclamation when those slaves had been bound those colored colored brethren and sisters in the south when they used to have slavery and emancipation proclamation was signed they had been whipped they had been beat amen been slaves and a certain moment but they said a certain morning you're going to be free in a certain day on a sun up and when the sun rises all slaves could go free those poor decrepit heartbeating slaves were so anxious to be free till the strongest of them climb way up to the top of the hill and women and men the weaklings all the way down to the bottom ones that couldn't be strong enough to climb up but they began to listen and those great big men that were stronger climbed up to the top of the hill and after a while they saw the streaks of that sun rising it was still dark in the valley but the sun was rising and they began to relay it down the sun is up we're free and the next one hollered down we're free and the next one hollered down we're free why the sun is up it dispelled the darkness and the scream and the shout begin to go off why because the sun is up he said that was the rising of the estuary but now we have the rising of the esso in we are free it dispels the darkness hallelujah amen there's enough sun that's been witnessed in this building that'll drop back depression it'll drive back anxiety it'll break change off your life amen there is enough sun it is up the sign of his resurrections are among us jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's not dead but he's alive forevermore the sun is up we can shout and praise god amen give me a little more we can shout and praise god why the sun is up oh now i know why you don't have no shouting around there because the sun ain't up but when you witness the sun is up uh you know what it was to have a sleigh belt on me i know what it was to be beaten by depression and beaten by fear and beating by aiming sexual spirits i know what it was like but the sun rose in my life amen and you're free and you're afraid amen we are 50 years even in thy tabernacle this is a jubilee year if there ever wants to be freedom in this church we ought to have it right now because the sun is up and he's healing cancer the sun is low and he's healing diseases of every kind the sun is up [Applause] [Music] the sun is up slaves to sin we were slaves of church denominations churchianity but we're free and the son of god is raised with healing in his wings hallelujah the sun is up i'm so glad of it he said let me scream lord let me scream the sun is up the ass so will the evening light is shining the holy ghost is here well come on now oh the sun is up i'm so glad seeing the same things taking place today as it did in his ministry as it did 2000 years ago the sun is up he's up from the dead he's been raised up now for 2000 years and we're living with him resurrected with him sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus what's the use of letting that pressure get on you live amen live why you got to live you can't die he that heareth my words and believeth on him that send me has what eternal life you can't die because the sun is up amen amen i am the resurrection life said jesus he that believeth on me though he were dead yet he shall live and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die we're already raised up with him we got the earnest the holy ghost has declared it to be so we've passed from death to life all the world's beat off oh hallelujah he said well it's all right for them young people to get excited but what about you know i've been here i'm a little old for that the old eagle let me give you a quote for your old stuff the old eagle can just scream as loud as he wants because every ska shackle has been tore off all the crust is gone and all the worldly habits and all the fuss and the tempers and the stew and the carrying off and running from denomination tonight it's all settled and jesus christ is amongst us we have a right to praise him the sun is up i'm up here safe forevermore in christ jesus a new creature but light will always dispel darkness it always pushes it back darkness gives way to light you know one he's talking brother brown tells a story i love this so one time up in the kentucky mountains as i was preaching early in the afternoon i was preaching on hellfire and brimstone for the unbeliever yeah we still believe in that so there was a no logger come back in this coming to service and i said i said all you drunkards and he was one of them you better repent and get rightful with god and there'd been this fellow come in the night that night was going to go up there he said i'm going to go up there and i'm going i'm going to throw that old preacher out the window i'm tired of hearing this nonsense so he came in the door and somebody come told me that's the roughest bunch there is around his they're standing there great big burly looking fellas his arms crossed beard hanging down his face about 30 years old was a mean looking man kept looking at me and i just kept looking at him repent or perish repent or perish he said brother he stayed a little too long what happened he was full of darkness but life began to shine on him he stayed a little too long and the holy spirit got a hold on him and he fell to the floor and brother bradley said in another place he said he couldn't hardly make it to the altar but he was crying and screaming and kicking his way up there [Applause] hallelujah he came with his hands up over his head crying god be merciful to me hallelujah that's why people are full of darkness they don't like to stay around well around light but if you stay long enough that light will throw up and push away that darkness if you stay in the presence of god long enough it'll push away the temper it'll push away the fear it'll push away the anxiety it'll push away the rebellion it'll push it all away next morning or the next night i went to church and there was this little girl back there she handed me a bunch of flowers when i came in the door and she said brother bill i just come to bring you these flowers cause we got a new daddy at home and i want to show you that i love you for coming here and letting jesus make a new daddy for us light came and drove away the darkness amen maybe the darkness tonight's been laughing at you it's been making fun of you'll never you'll never be free you'll never you'll never rise up from that place you know let me give you a scripture for that micah 7 and verse 7 says therefore i will look unto the lord i will wait for the god of my salvation my god will hear me that's where you got to come to him in faith that's the problem with a lot of people they start talking to god but they start talking to in doubt well god if you do if you if if you know it's a big word for two letters if if you love me maybe you'll hear me if i'm more if i'm your child that ain't the way micah came to him he said i will wait for the god of my salvation because my god will hear me and he goes and speaks to the darkness he says rejoice not against me o my enemy for when i fall i shall rise and when i sit in darkness the lord shall be a light unto me amen may that darkness has knocked you down you need to turn back to that darkness say my god hears me and you may knock me down but i shall rise i may be in doubt and darkness but i will see light again cause god's gonna shine upon me darkness always dispels the light let's read a few in discernment here it says you have trouble for quite a while you was hurt inside of you is tore loose got some sort of intestinal trouble swelling up is i see you used to be a larger man but you lost a lot of weight from this many pounds have dropped off not only this but let me tell you something i see a dark shadow follow you till about five or six years ago and you became a christian at that time that man said that man speaks up and says that's right i accepted christ in moody church six years ago maybe five and a half and i'm going to tell you and this was his testimony as it speaks on tape and a twinkling of an eye my wife only here she could tell you the drinking and the tobacco habit which i'd had for 20 years fell away like that well we still got that same light here tonight it did it to multiple people sitting right here in this congregation that would come here with an alcohol problem or a drug problem or or smoking or narcotics or whatever it is cigarette nicotine that's the word i'm looking for whatever it is and be dropped off in a moment why light dispels darkness he said god bless you my brother darkness then light death to life believe the lord jesus for your healing another place she said i see the lady lady you're trying to move off to some off of something it's a chair she gets up and she sits back down she gets up and she sits back down she tries to get back up it's a little chair with an arm on it like a rocker she's trying to move out of that place she's trying to get towards the window but it's holding her back and now she's oh i see her holding her back it's arthritis of the spine it's in her back she wanted prayer for someone else too that's your daughter you believe god can reveal to me what's wrong with her she's having migraine headaches that's thus saith the lord oh there's something still you're pondering about it's in your heart for someone else too that's your son there's a dark shadow over him and you're praying for salvation of his soul he's a sinner that's thus saith the lord do you believe you know something speaking that isn't me lady you heard my voice but that wasn't me and now that feeling that was on you just a few minutes ago is lifted and he said why because between you and i stood the light hallelujah that angel and now that is gone from you hallelujah and i believe you will receive everything that you have asked for oh why not amen that is what the power of the light can produce maybe you've been seen in a vision trying to get up getting knocked back down trying to get up getting knocked back down trying to get up getting knocked back down and there's a dark shadow upon your life but tonight there is a greater light there's a light that can shine on your darkness and raise you up off of that place [Applause] hallelujah brother branham another place is i'm happy to be in this refuge i'm safe forevermore how sweet to trust in jesus i love him what a challenge to a people he promised it'll be light in the evening time there will be a day that won't be a day or night it'll be a day of gloom just enough to walk and accept but in the evening time it shall be light he says little lady you're just as conscious as you can be that something just happened i'm looking right at it that light settled right over you i'm looking at it i've never seen you before i guess we're strangers to one another that's right raise up your hand there's a dark shadow around you it's a shadow of death you're suffering with tumors it's a tumor in your breast as a great percent of your breasts are covered with tumors you have only one hope you're a fine person i've got a good contact with the spirit with you you believe me to be his prophet you know i don't know you but you're conscious of a real sweet feeling all around you right now that's the light that glow of light you're not from here you're from away from here birmingham i've seen that banana market there your name is miss vincent that's true have faith in god at this time it's gone from you that shadow that was over you has left why because of the light and that light is in the building tonight he said how can you say that i say that by his word where two or three are gathered in my name there i shall be there was no question about that there's no wondering about that there's no ifs about that there's i shall be now if we can get our faith to realize and to recognize it and begin to elevate to realize hey there's a light here that's greater than any darkness it's greater than any tumor it's greater than any cancer it's greater than any sugar diabetes it's greater than any high blood pressure it's greater than any suicidal spirit hallelujah it's greater than any depression it's greater than heart trouble it's greater than anything you could ever go through that light is in the building right now [Applause] why don't you say lord elevate my faith right now look past the darkness and see the light. he said i ask anybody to come question the woman find out there could be a doctor present why not come ask if you're a little skeptic ask he says which i know you're present so why not say it so i used to call that out but it hurts too many feelings the light knows what you're thinking the skeptic's over hiding in the darkness and the light saying there he is another one you're facing an operation as a tumor you believe he can tell me where the tumor is would it help you it's in the stomach do you believe you won't have to have it have that operation to be gone then don't ever doubt it it's all over in the name of jesus he said you go ask the young lady whatever it was told her whatever it told her ask her if she knew me or anything about it ask what was told her find out if it's the truth but whatever she'll wrong what was wrong with her if she will ever remain with that kind of faith he said because i noticed a light that fell over her and the dark shadow that was hanging there left if she'll ever remain in that faith and don't turn it loose she will get well how to do sir there's something strange about you satan is desiring to take your life you're all tore up you think you've send away your day of grace you think your life is ruined do you love jesus you do well what makes you love him before there could be any anything to there to make you love him there has to be a creator to create that love in your heart is that right if you'd send your day of grace away you would hate jesus man the light knows what darkness is thinking darkness is saying darkness is the devil is just lying to you because you love him you're all right you're nervous come here he said come here i'll cast that thing away from you if you'll believe it bow your heads and keep your heads about everyone until you hear me say raise up this it's demonology all right god be merciful to this boy he stands here and satan's trying to get him to come in this condition to commit suicide but thou art here to relieve the boy and to make this evil spirit go and thou has said these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils then upon the authority of god's word as a believer he didn't say as a prophet he said as a believer i now ask the spirit that's on this boy of unbelief to leave him go out in the name of jesus and bother him no more and i set him free and may the enemy be bound and leave this room and torment no one else in jesus christ's name now you're all right oh praise the lamb of the lord now you're all right you can raise your head feel all right son is that right devils he just says devils now notice what he says here you would have committed suicide in a few days that was on your mind he thought he had send away his day of grace and when he came up a real black heavy light fog was meeting me in the face notice where it was at it wouldn't meet him in the feet or the legs or or the arms it was meeting him in the face this devil had come against that boy's mind to where he thought the thoughts that he was thinking was his thoughts nobody loves me nobody cares i don't sin the way that you don't send it you know the devil will tell you have sinned away your day of grace until you say i have sent away my day of grace the devil will tell you you are lost until you say i am lost the devil will tell you you are sick until you say i am sick the devil will tell you that there's no hope from you until you say there's no hope for me beating you in the face meeting you in the face always in your mind torment but there's a light hallelujah it's a real black heavy-like fog meeting me in the face that's devils but now the boy's free and he no don't you feel happy go on home rejoicing thanking god for his goodness to you god bless you let's say thanks be to god amen what happened the light of god came and it drove away the darkness brother would tell about being in carlsbad uh carlsbad caverns big caverns i was i i've never been in these particular ones i've been some in czech republic way down about a mile below the earth surface and uh and i experienced what he talks about here of them turning out the lights it's a it's a serious thing when you don't have any light there's no nothing to find you if you stay there long enough you don't know if you're hanging upside down or backwards they actually say planes can get in clouds and they fly on them long enough if they don't have the right equipment pilots can get so disoriented that they think they're flying upright and they're flying upside down and they go try to go up and they go down and crash into the earth this is what happens to men and women that gets in the clouds and they don't have the right equipment the holy ghost is a compass he's the right equipment he'll get you safely where you need to be amen men and women without the holy ghost without a touch of god in their life they'll get in clouds and they'll get in places and they'll think they're upside down and are upside up right and they're upside down they'll think they're in this way and that way they think they're over here they're and they're somewhere out and this gets so disoriented hey man maybe you can find yourself like that but don't you start looking back to your compass looking back to the saying the equipment that's been placed there and say god i'm in a little bit of a whirl right now and i don't know if i'm upside down or i'm sitting upright or sideways but i know you got the way than the way the truth and the lie and i'm just going to put my life in your hands and i'm going to trust you in the middle of my trial these two children man his wife and a couple children went to the elevator went down the bottom of this thing when they got down there they turned off the lights and you can put your hand like this and you can't you there's nothing so dark and this little girl began screaming oh help she was so scared to death it got so dark she was grabbing everything she could grab screaming just as loud as she grabbed hollering for a papa hollering for her mama she couldn't stand it it was so dark she had never witnessed such darkness and then she was screaming in such a hysterics hysterics said about like the little bride is today what about this brother what about that what's going on what's going on around us it's so dark but in the middle of all that her brother cried out little sister don't fear because there's a man here can turn on the lights oh don't fear little bride there is a man capital may here here who can turn on the line he will make his word live right in the middle of darkness right in the middle of chaos he will make his word live he'll make a word come so alive that will strike the heart of men and women to whether to take a body change and leave this whole vile world hallelujah he said well we don't know how we don't know when so uh he said brother i only know nothing about that but i know he'll be there i know he can turn on the lights he did he showed it all the way down the seven church ages and every age of darkness he would turn on the light he would turn on luther he would turn on wesley he would turn on the pentecostals he would turn on amen in our age in our time listen there's a switch that's about to flip that's going to dispel darkness forever hallelujah that's going to be such a bright and shining light that the sun and the moon is not going to be needed in that city but the lamb shall be the light amen he shall give us light and darkness will not be there at all he is here he is the one that can turn on the light he is the light when he makes himself known it brings light it takes christ to flash away on his lights and then all darkness scatters it separates them and he's pulling his little bride because he said i'll take a people out of the gentiles for my name sake that'll have my name what is my name not methodist not baptist not presbyterian not lutheran but jesus christ that's right he is the light the truth the life and there is no darkness in him and he scatters the darkness when he comes in because he is the word and the word is the light and this word is not getting weaker the power of god is not getting weaker darkness amen why would it not get weaker because darkness is getting greater so when there's a greater darkness you need a greater light amen so this power is not going down it's going up and up and up and up and greater and greater and greater that's why i believe we're going to see more miracles more things of god more power of god amen because there's not going to be less light it's going to be more light it's not going to be less power it's going to be more power of god hallelujah that ought to give some happiness in your heart some joy in your heart listen we're not going down in the darkness but we that have set in darkness have saw a great light and that light is shining greater and greater and it's got such a drawing power that's going to draw us right out of this whole world hallelujah that's right when he spoke let there be light that was the word that became light and he speaks this it is the light of that age it's not a glare it's it's people may be living in a glare but he is the vindicated word he is absolutely the light in the time of darkness all the false glares and things will fade away but this light won't fade away and he says he that believeth in me the works that i do ye shall do also maybe i can say it like this the light that i have you shall have also he had enough light in him that opened up blinded eyes he had enough light in him that would give deaf ears back their hearing he had enough light in him that the mute would speak and the lame would walk amen the cur the people in their mind out of their minds would come back to themselves he had enough light in him he would dispel every darkness and he said the light that i have the things that i do shall ye do also the father has sent me come in him jesus then to say the same one sends you comes in you the works that he did then the same he does today because the word is made flesh and human flesh manifested itself as the light of the day there we are there it is just showing the way to the light in the light wise men who are not blinded by creeds and denominations will walk in that light there's a man here that can turn on the lights how does he turn them on by vindicating his word for this day hallelujah jesus the son of god who promises the word for this day is right here with us don't get scared did you hear the words of the prophet don't get scared don't pay attention to what they're doing because if you do you will walk into darkness so quote be wise they that do wise daniel said in the last days we'll do exploits they'll walk in the light for he is the light don't worry it may be dark look like they said look like they're going to try to force us everyone see their proclamations going out all these little churches coming into one great conglomeration of things but don't forget where he said you can read many times he said the next thing for the bride is the rapture that's quite a light that'll dispel a lot of darkness amen but as we said in darkness things looks very superstitious you wonder about it you don't know what's happening now over there in russia what's happening in ukraine what's what's happening globally around the world what's going on last two years been a lot of what's going on brother brown talks about superstitious mountain so i've heard of it for a long time heard many legends have been told about superstition i remember looking for it the first time and it was before day and a great big ghostly shadow hung to the east of me which is known as superstition said i heard about the indians how they would wouldn't go near it for they were afraid of it the spanish had mistreated them the early days when they was hunting for gold and they claimed it had evil spirits lived in it and all this stirred my curiosity but i only had a flashlight to see superstition and it wasn't enough he said but then i watched until after a while the majesty of the sun began to move upon the darkness and when it did and it separated the darkness from the light and it pressed the darkness back and finally she raised up to her highness up over the top of the mountain and it showed superstition just what it really was it lit up and it showed what it was and all the spooks and the fears i had had of superstition when the sun come up and the power was falling upon it all of that fled away the sun is the king of all lights in the natural light no matter how much artificial light we can have and we can gather together and we can never produce what the sun produces and when it rises all the rest of those artificial lights dim out now tonight you can go out in their parking lot and we got some nice lights that light up our parking lot but they only light it up nice at night they only light up real good in the dark come morning they still on you won't even notice them you'll drive up here i've done it before and look at wow i didn't realize them lights wrong you didn't even pay no attention to them they wouldn't make it have no effect on what was going on right there because the sun was up hallelujah amen when the sun rises darkness loses its effect artificial light loses its effect powers of satan loses its effect amen when this light rises every devil in hell loses its superstition and you begin to realize that's nothing but a devil that's nothing but a devil that's nothing but a devil cancer is nothing but a devil high blood pressure is nothing but a devil suicide spirit that's nothing but a devil and every day oh the light has shined in this day and it showed us who the devil is and where the devil belongs hallelujah the devil doesn't belong over your mind and over your head he belongs under your feet and the lie has drove him to the place he belongs hallelujah and it's no more words it's no more fear we know who he is and he's defeated we know who he is and he does not have power over me [Applause] that's the same thing it is when the word of god it rises all superstitions denominational fanaticisms and so it just moves away and it shows exactly what it is it may look like light but it ain't that light it's not even a true representation of that light the moon is a true representation of the sun but those lights out there is not a true representation of the sun the moon is reflecting that same light the sun gives off these lights out here they're man-made they're artificial and this is exactly what happens in artificial lights around the message they're not a true representation of the sun and when the sun rises they all go out hallelujah people can rise isms can rise communism passivism superstitions cults whatever it may be might rise but when the king of light the king light of the bible raises up all superstitions are gone hallelujah and you'll see right there is vindicated proves to be light we have no right to argue against that because it shuts out all other lies jesus said let every man's word be alive and mind be the truth that his word is superior over every man's word over everything the devil can say his word is light but we know that in the beginning it must have been foggy and dismal and dark the world was without form and void and god knew he had need of light and his seeds had already been planted there in the earth and he needed light to bring forth that seed because he knew that light had a drawing power but the seed was already there and he said just like it is in each age god is foretold and placed in each age seeds and there has to be the manifestation of light to bring forth the seed see the light does two things it dispels the darkness it shows who the darkness truly is but it also brings forth the sea amen it has to make it live for that age and he talks about the lights and their strength they couldn't be so strong in certain times a certain place because we know the seven church ages is the wheat plant amen it's a tender plant growing up and it comes all the way to a seed again it takes certain phases of the sun to operate in certain phases of the of the plant because if you put the harvest sun and the time of planting you'll burn it all up or in the time of growth you'll burn it all up god knows how to work his light god's word comes in seasons in the right season the law and grace amen the truth of the word it comes in the right times in the right ages in the right moments by the word of god the sun shines the day because every sun that we're enjoying is god's word may manifest this very sunlight that we see seen today is nothing but god's word that said let there be light what if it said let there be light and there was no light then it wasn't god who spoke it but when god says let there be there will be and so we find out that the sun that we're now enjoying is the manifestation of god's word spoken genesis and it's still shining today i mean enjoy the sun today when a beautiful day go out to enjoy the warmth of the sun the rays just basking it's like oh this is glorious especially after coming after after days of gloominess and rain and washington weather get some sunshine it feels good feel like doing something bones ain't creaking no more muscles are limbering up why because of the sun the sun's shining and he said we realize that god's light of the day is his son the one is estuan the one we're speaking about is esso win in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god hebrews 13 8 he is the same yesterday today and forever it's the word of god always it was christ to noah it was christ and moses it was christ and david it was christ all the way down to the bible the spirit of christ working and making manifest and bringing light for their time so it is in the seven church ages all the way down irenaeus martin luther all those the all those down wesley the pentecostal moments and all all the way down to our time is the spirit of christ the light of god's word but notice we're in harvest time so in harvest time the light is shining greater than it ever shown before it's back to where and his strength again it's not less it's greater and the light is shining and the light shines no life can come outside of light light produces it natural or spiritual there must be light to produce life the holy light can come by the word of god and god's word is the light when it's made manifest it's just not it's the seeds laying there it's bringing forth nothing can live natural or spiritual without light but then when that light rises it'll always dispel darkness read a couple of scriptures we bring this down isaiah 35 and verse 4 says sayer to say to them that are of a fearful heart be strong fear not behold your god will come with vengeance even god with a recompense he will come and save you then the eyes of the blind shall be opened and the ears of the death shall be unstopped then shall the lame man leap as a harp and the tongue of the dumb seeing for in the wilderness shall waters break out and streams in the desert and the parched ground shall become a pool in the thirsty land springs of water and the habitation of dragons where each lay shall be grasped with reeds and rushes a highway shall be there away and it shall be called the way of holiness the unclean shall not pass over for it shall be for those the wayfarer man though fool shall not wear it now air therein no line shall be there nor any ravenous beast shall go upon their own and it shall not be found there but the redeemed shall walk there did you hear that the redeemed shall walk there the ransom of the lord shall return and come design with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads hallelujah amen the devil try to place his thoughts upon your head but you're to have the joy of the lord and the songs of zion and they shall obtain joy and gladness and sorrow and sighing shall flee away this is the breaking of the dawn of the light that will never go out but it will break forth into eternal day second corinthians 4 6 says for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts how many can say he shined in my heart to give light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ but we have this treasure in earthly vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us we're troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life the light the life
