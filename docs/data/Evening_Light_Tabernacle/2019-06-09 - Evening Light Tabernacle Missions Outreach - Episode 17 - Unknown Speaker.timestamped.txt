[0:05] hello everyone we are the ministry team
[0:08] and even in like tabernacle in Minden
[0:11] Louisiana and we're just happy that you
[0:14] joined with us again
[0:16] today for another discussion on the Word
[0:19] of God in past sessions we have talked
[0:22] about what defines the church in our
[0:25] last session we were dealing with the
[0:29] judgment that fell upon the Jewish
[0:31] people for the rejection of the Messiah
[0:34] and missing their day of visitation and
[0:38] I wanted to make it clear that we do not
[0:41] believe that the Jewish people are
[0:43] Christ killers in fact the Romans and
[0:47] Gentiles had as much to do with
[0:51] crucifying crises what the Jews did and
[0:55] so but it was that Jesus willingly and
[0:59] purposely died for the sins of the world
[1:02] specifically and personally for our sins
[1:06] and to do this he would come in such a
[1:09] way that would blind the eyes of his own
[1:12] people for the sake of salvation in
[1:14] order to become the slain lamb on the
[1:18] behalf of sin the scripture says it this
[1:21] way Paul in first corinthians says which
[1:24] none of the princes of this world knew
[1:26] for had they known it they would not
[1:29] have crucified the Lord of glory so we
[1:33] believe the Jews are God's people but
[1:36] because of how he came as a suffering
[1:38] Prince instead of a reigning king that
[1:42] they had hoped for in that hour a very
[1:46] gross terrible darkness they mistakenly
[1:51] crucified their Messiah yes sir
[1:54] and so this is an exact parallel to what
[1:59] happened with Joseph and his brethren
[2:01] Joseph was loved of his father hated and
[2:04] betrayed by his brother and sold for
[2:06] silver down into Egypt and on the way to
[2:09] the throne he strode into prison
[2:11] from their exalted to the right hand of
[2:14] Pharaoh and yet he says but don't be
[2:17] angry at yourselves this was done to
[2:20] preserve life so you know again we
[2:24] realized that even the rejection of
[2:28] Christ was so that the Gentiles could
[2:31] come in and so that they could God would
[2:34] call out of them a people so why is it
[2:38] that the people of God except for like
[2:42] few were swept away into two thousand
[2:46] years of great tribulation and
[2:50] persecution upon the people
[2:52] is there a repeat of this do you think
[2:54] you know a lot of a lot of people
[2:57] question why you know Christ died 2,000
[3:02] years ago why are we still here what's
[3:05] happened has he just forgotten about us
[3:08] sir and what many doesn't realize is the
[3:12] Holy Spirit indicated as Jesus said when
[3:15] he the Spirit of Truth has come he'll
[3:17] lead you and guide you into all truth
[3:19] and show you things to come that there
[3:21] was more truth going to come and we find
[3:25] even in the Book of Revelations that had
[3:27] opened up the plan of redemption God's
[3:30] future work to the Gentile people and so
[3:34] what's obscure to many is actually very
[3:38] detailed in the prophetic book of the
[3:40] book of Revelation so while the Jews
[3:44] were scattered throughout the known
[3:45] world for two thousand years God was now
[3:48] going to bring a gospel to the Gentile
[3:51] people for the first time around the
[3:53] world and it's an incredible prophecies
[3:57] that are attached to this but God the
[4:01] Bible said has God you know forsaken his
[4:04] people or as you know as this done the
[4:07] Bible says God forbid yeah but God will
[4:09] bring Israel back to a restoration he's
[4:13] not done with her he's just injected the
[4:15] work of grace to the Gentile people and
[4:18] he will return it's very important to
[4:20] remember that they're blinding was for
[4:23] our sake amen the reason that they went
[4:25] through that is so that we could have an
[4:27] opportunity at the gospel mm-hmm you
[4:30] know but even you talked about them
[4:31] being swept away and in the siege of
[4:33] Titus those things weren't done without
[4:35] warning without opportunity to repent
[4:37] you know there was there was warning in
[4:40] the scripture that told them when you
[4:41] see these things come into pass if
[4:43] you're on the rooftop you know come
[4:44] don't come back down and pray that you
[4:47] don't have to flee in the winter on the
[4:49] Sabbath day and we're in a time where
[4:51] there's been warnings given to the to
[4:53] the Gentiles yes you know it's not that
[4:55] God's going to come back and strike
[4:57] judgment and people are going to be able
[4:58] to say well you didn't give us
[4:59] opportunity there's there's plenty of
[5:01] warning and plenty of opportunity once
[5:03] again yeah also it's it's amazing to me
[5:07] that how how they were blinded when
[5:10] Jesus came and done undeniable things
[5:13] that you could not attribute to a man
[5:15] you couldn't attribute to any no man
[5:18] could do what he'd done in miracles and
[5:20] signs you know like the blind man that
[5:22] was healed he created highballs you know
[5:24] and it was questioning him about it he
[5:26] said well this is a marvelous thing
[5:28] never since before the world was formed
[5:30] there's a man been given his sight and
[5:32] getting get been given eyes hey yeah you
[5:35] don't know who he is yeah but then you
[5:37] flip-flop it and now here we're coming
[5:39] backwards changing back over and there's
[5:41] also another blinding that's taking
[5:42] place and people are not realizing when
[5:45] they see the same signs of the Messiah
[5:47] and they're calling it a devil or
[5:48] they're calling it you know the curse of
[5:51] thing and it's really God a gay man they
[5:54] M eyes and cannot see and ears and
[5:56] cannot hear yeah well it just shows that
[5:59] we're here in that last age of Laodicea
[6:04] where that they're blinded wretched
[6:07] miserable poor and don't know it
[6:10] and it's a horrible condition because it
[6:13] was in a condition just like that that
[6:16] Israel would reject their Messiah so you
[6:20] will find that among the Gentiles the
[6:22] Bible prophesies a time that Christ will
[6:25] be put outside his own church he's
[6:28] standing on the outside
[6:29] door knocking and so there is another
[6:32] rejection of Christ going on this time
[6:35] by the Gentile people incredible but yet
[6:37] in the midst of that there's an Alexei
[6:40] just as it was with the Jews hey man
[6:42] we've in the day of Titus and I know we
[6:44] spoke of it last time
[6:46] you know the Christians weren't called
[6:48] inside the city your day they had they
[6:50] heated the warming you know and we're
[6:52] talking about the rejection that's going
[6:54] on the sad thing is that a lot of the
[6:56] rejection is actually amongst people who
[6:58] claim to be worshipers a lot of the
[7:00] rejection is amongst people who claim
[7:02] even Christianity and you go back to
[7:05] Titus and Josephus says that 1.1 million
[7:10] died in Jerusalem which was actually a
[7:13] much larger number than the national
[7:15] population of Jerusalem and the reason
[7:17] it was so many is that worshippers who
[7:20] had not heeded what Jesus said came to
[7:23] the city edible to worship for the
[7:25] Passover and got trapped inside the city
[7:27] but here they are denying the warning
[7:31] that they had been given but they were
[7:32] worshippers yeah and that's what calls
[7:34] the great slaughter so we're seeing a
[7:37] real phenomenon our date because
[7:39] actually Israel is once against the
[7:43] nation that the Jewish people are back
[7:46] in their homeland and so it's a
[7:48] phenomenal that hasn't been seen in
[7:51] these past 2,000 years showing that we
[7:55] are at the setting of the closing of the
[7:59] Gentiles dispensation because Israel is
[8:03] now gathered back and getting ready for
[8:05] to receive their Messiah yes so what
[8:08] kind of people are we to be in this
[8:10] island man jesus said when you see the
[8:13] fig tree put forth its figs you know
[8:15] summer is nigh likewise when you see
[8:16] these prophecies take place look up for
[8:19] your Redemption draweth nigh
[8:20] yeah and it's indicated that the Israel
[8:24] becoming a nation after 2,000 years it
[8:27] is indicating the coming of the Lord you
[8:30] know I would like to just share that
[8:32] scriptures Matthew 24 33 so likewise
[8:36] when you see all these things know that
[8:39] it is near even at the door
[8:41] very I saying to you this generation
[8:43] shall not pass till all these things be
[8:46] fulfilled and many people who get that
[8:49] said well there's 40 years of generation
[8:52] and all 19 or was it 1948 may the 14th
[8:57] that Israel becomes a nation and so now
[9:00] you know it looks like things just are
[9:02] continuing on as they always was and
[9:04] maybe we're just getting alarmed about
[9:07] nothing but I want you to remember and
[9:10] look at it this way it's not when the
[9:14] United Nation recognizes them or not
[9:17] when even when they form a government
[9:19] but when God recognizes Israel as a
[9:23] nation is when God reveals himself to
[9:27] them as a messiah it'll be that
[9:30] generation that will not pass away till
[9:34] all things be fulfilled so you know
[9:38] we're in a great power and a great time
[9:40] you know right on the cusp of hundreds
[9:44] of scriptures being focusing yes sir so
[9:48] Titus coming in and ringing down the
[9:52] curtain on the Jewish dispensation as
[9:55] it's moving now to the Gentiles Paul
[9:58] comes right in behind opens the door
[10:00] faith to the Gentiles in several places
[10:03] in the book of Acts Paul said lo we
[10:05] turned to the Gentiles and God begins a
[10:08] work among the Gentile people bringing
[10:11] the gospel for the first time an
[10:12] opportunity to know God and to know
[10:15] salvation and what a glorious thing
[10:18] Titus was a type of the endtime
[10:23] tribulation period as he brought the
[10:28] judgment on the end of the Jewish nation
[10:30] there will be a judgment on the end of
[10:34] the Gentile dispensation mm-hmm and this
[10:37] is called the Great Tribulation Period
[10:38] and a lot of people understand it is the
[10:43] Great Tribulation Period but we
[10:47] understand it that there's to be a
[10:49] rapture
[10:51] that goes before that time yeah and
[10:54] there's some that have the conception
[10:57] that at the rapture planes will fall out
[10:59] of the sky and cars will be left abandon
[11:03] it stoplights and it'll be mass chaos
[11:05] and people will be screaming and
[11:07] realized
[11:08] dear God we miss the rapture we miss the
[11:10] rapture but according to the scriptures
[11:14] that really won't be the picture and the
[11:18] reason that that won't be the picture
[11:20] one is because Jesus said he'll come as
[11:22] a thief in the night yes and that it'll
[11:25] almost be unrecognized and unknown right
[11:29] number two it's not all the church as we
[11:33] would call it church that goes in the
[11:36] wrath but there's actually more to it in
[11:41] the rapture of there's one group that
[11:44] does go in the rapture that's called the
[11:46] church and there's another group that's
[11:49] called the church that goes through the
[11:51] tribulation period so Eisley in the end
[11:53] time there's really two comings of the
[11:55] Lord if we would take it you know his
[11:58] comings as always in threes he came
[12:00] first to redeem his his bride his church
[12:03] and then he comes back for his church
[12:07] and then he comes back with his church
[12:09] so not with Israel one thing that made
[12:13] the real blinding of Israel was as they
[12:17] were they were looking for the wrong
[12:19] coming yeah okay so they were looking
[12:22] for him to come as king but they did not
[12:24] understand he had to fulfill Isaiah 53
[12:27] and come as a suffering Prince to become
[12:30] wounded for our transgressions and pay
[12:32] the penalty of sin and he had to do that
[12:35] first before the kingdom would be
[12:37] restored to Israel and and the great
[12:40] kingdom of ahead I had so you know they
[12:44] were looking for the wrong coming and
[12:46] even there they wanted to make Christ
[12:48] the King as you remember there was
[12:50] several incidences where they tried to
[12:52] take him by force and make him a king
[12:55] named one of the Messiah drive the
[12:57] Romans back and let the Israel be
[13:02] the predominant nation in the world and
[13:04] all of the dreams that the Jewish people
[13:06] had because they were looking for the
[13:09] wrong coming yes and I think today that
[13:12] people are looking for the wrong coming
[13:14] they're confusing the two of worries
[13:16] coming where he's coming back for his
[13:20] bride and the one where he comes back
[13:22] with yes the Saints to take over the
[13:26] earth and so it all happens here in this
[13:28] time period but but there is one where
[13:33] ever I will see him and every tongue
[13:35] will confess and that's when he comes
[13:37] back with his Saints yes and history
[13:39] fulfilled
[13:41] Zacharias prophecies in Zechariah 12 and
[13:44] 14 which which shows him that the Lord
[13:48] that God will come in all his saints
[13:50] with him this fulfills revelation one in
[13:53] seven that ever I shall see him and they
[13:57] that pierced him which is the Jews will
[14:01] see him and so this is when he will come
[14:07] back with the Saints after the marriage
[14:11] supper of the lamb and and with for the
[14:13] great battle of Armageddon yes so people
[14:16] are looking for the wrong coming that's
[14:17] why they're expecting you know our plane
[14:20] wrecks and crisis and everything comes
[14:23] to a stop because honestly on that day
[14:26] at the great battle of Armageddon
[14:28] everything will come to stop as the
[14:30] earth burns yes that's right amen yeah
[14:33] well that's interesting that he said as
[14:36] a thief yes you know a thief doesn't
[14:39] come to your house they'll break through
[14:41] the wind and say I'm here to rob you it
[14:43] comes into your home and before you know
[14:45] it he's taking things that you've got
[14:47] and you didn't realize he might have
[14:49] been asleep whatever you get the next
[14:51] morning you realize yes stuffs not there
[14:53] it's gone I've been robbed
[14:55] yeah you know and that's the way the
[14:56] wraps are gonna take place it's gonna be
[14:58] gone happened and done before people
[15:01] realize you know something's happened
[15:03] that's right
[15:03] so this is the rapture is a lot of time
[15:05] where that there everybody's gonna see
[15:08] him on a cloud and
[15:09] and you know everybody will be breaking
[15:13] through the roofs and and going up in
[15:15] the air as pictured by lots of people
[15:18] this mental thought that many people
[15:21] have of a mass exodus of people it's
[15:26] gonna be a secret coming of Christ yes
[15:30] which means that the people are going to
[15:32] be into the tribulation before they even
[15:36] realize what's going on that's right I
[15:38] thought he was gonna come and they're
[15:41] gonna be in the middle of the Great
[15:42] Tribulation right a couple times ago
[15:48] that we we gathered together to our
[15:50] discussions we covered Matthew 24 when
[15:53] he asked three questions when shall
[15:54] these things be what should be the sign
[15:56] of thy kind coming in the end of the
[15:58] world and we had covered that in Matthew
[16:01] 24 that Jesus covers many things that
[16:05] would happen in that day in the judgment
[16:07] of that day and then also speaking of
[16:10] the last days and then people can mix
[16:12] those prophecies together and kind of
[16:15] get it muddled up or confused but it was
[16:18] in Matthew 24 that that Jesus gives a
[16:21] rundown of the sign of his coming the
[16:24] end of the world and so forth but at the
[16:26] close of those comments he begins to
[16:28] repeat himself that no man knows the day
[16:31] or the hour but only the father not even
[16:33] the angels of heaven and then he says
[16:36] there will be two in the field one will
[16:37] be taken and want to be left two in the
[16:39] bed want to be taken and one will be
[16:41] left
[16:41] then he says watch therefore for you
[16:44] know not the hour that the that your
[16:46] Lord doth come so he begins in several
[16:50] places in Matthew 24 he begins to just
[16:53] lay out watch watch and he begins to
[16:55] emphasize and stress watch because it
[16:58] would be something that would be missed
[17:00] and then that's in Matthew 24 Matthew 25
[17:04] he goes directly into a parable of the
[17:07] coming of the Lord amen and he speaks of
[17:10] ten virgins and he speaks of two groups
[17:14] here two classes of people both are
[17:17] called virgins yeah five are wise and
[17:19] five were foolish
[17:21] and five make it in and five are left
[17:24] outside yeah brother Craig this is
[17:27] wonderful and I think um you know as we
[17:31] wrap up this session today that this
[17:33] will be a very good topic for us to come
[17:36] back to on our next session and we'll be
[17:38] able to talk about the foolish and and
[17:42] the wise virgins and also this part
[17:44] about no man knoweth the day or the hour
[17:47] I think there's any very exciting things
[17:49] that we can talk about so god bless you
[17:52] today as we wrap up this session of this
[17:57] discussion today we are glad that you
[17:59] join with us and look forward to seeing
