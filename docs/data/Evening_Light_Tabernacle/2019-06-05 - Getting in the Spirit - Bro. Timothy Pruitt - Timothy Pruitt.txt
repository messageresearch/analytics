name Amen amen let's turn to Acts chapter 2 Acts chapter 2 and verse 17 amen this is and it shall come to pass in the last days saith God who said it God said it I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and all my servants and all my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and I will show wonders in the heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapor and smoke and the Sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the Great and notable day of the Lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved amen also just real quick in Revelation 1 and verse 10 it says I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day amen would let you be seated this evening a man just like to speak to you this evening on getting in the spirit getting in the spirit we talked about Sunday about and the Spirit of God moved but we won't just we to really receive from him has got to be more than him just moving but there has to be a response from us say ma'am it has to be a moving of ourselves out of the way so he can come and he can take preeminence in our lives but I want to speak for a moment on these things you know there's two forces that govern the world today two spirits it's the Spirit of Christ and the spirit of the Antichrist we can see these at work since the beginning of time we can see as it come in the garden there and into Cain and Abel and then as they begin to come and bring their sacrifices unto God one got in the spirit of true worship and one got in the spirit of human ability worship amen to worship their own human abilities and know what they can do and what they could bring and my brother Branham says you know we need to watch those spirits and how they begin to move it is the spirit of anything that does the work of it anyhow it takes the spirit to do it the people have to be in this kind of spirit to bring the latter days the people in the spirit have to be in the spirit of the last days the nations are in the spirit of the end time that's why they have the atomic weapons he says in the hydrogen weapons and today you know Russia's testing their supersonic whatever kind of weapons and nuclear powers and - all kinds of things because it's the spirit of the last day and people are in the spirit of the endtime the churches but you said this the people are in the spirit of the endtime and we can we can say man to that because we see a whole group of people that have received the spirit that is prevalent in this last day this Laodicean spirit and they're you know naked and blind wretched and don't even know it has to have need of nothing you know relying once again on their own self and their own abilities ain't meant instead of the things of God amen and they begin to rely on what they can do what they can offer what Who I am amen instead of what God has already done and then and he says but there is a people that is also in the spirit he said the church is moving together under the power and the impact of the Holy Spirit amen the world's running out there and making fun and scoffing and laughing they're living like the devil every day he said it is the spirit of the thing a man Indian I would read a couple things he says in in discernment he said speaking of someone he said between you and me your spirit is speaking to me and I'm speaking back to you through mortal lips but both to anointings he says if this spirit here that's on me to bless you he said not that I can bless you it can bless you he said if but it's only if your spirit is willing to be blessed a man if you have the spirit of unbelief then it cannot bless you it'll just tell you what's wrong it'll tell you something sin you own but if you believe these two spirits can get together it's a battle he said here's a demon crying begging pleading like that and here's the Spirit of God standing there looking at it he said but now it just depends on the way our spirit is running he says I believe if you can get you to believe that what I've said is the truth then something's going to take place you understand what I mean so Amen he said he's saying there's a spirit and upon you and upon me and it depends on who you yield yourself to it was the spirit of sickness in you and or a spirit of sin whatever it is but there's also the Holy Ghost that will stand there and call that thing out and we know he's still calling it out today he's still the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart that's never left the word still that ain't math and that word stands in the pulpit and he begins to speak the Spirit of God follows that it begins to tell you but it only depends on who you lend yourself to what spirit that you'll yield yourself to or you'll walk out of here with the same thing or even worse say man I'll walk out of here delivered it's all up to you remember what to be able to get that you got into you got to get to be able to get deliverance you have to get in the spirit of deliverance amen to receive healing you got to get in the spirit of healing to receive these things from God you have to get in the spirit of it amen he says now if I lunch is another one he says if I Lord Jesus when he talked to the woman at the well he didn't just talk to her little while but after a while he talked to her he said go and get me a drink what did he do he caught her spirit and he was trying here he was caught trying to contact that and the first patient here in the platform tonight so are you talking to the person he said I have to contact your spirit you see see we're both men standing here going to meet God one day but you're also a supernatural being inside of you as a spirit that I live somewhere forever if you got a disease Satan did that any but God has sent me to pray so these two spirits will come together then if his spirit can come and it but it will depend on which one you give into of these two spirits amen if you believe that's what you're told it's going to be all right you'll get well if you do not believe it course you can do nothing for you Amen but God is coming to show himself to you but it's up to you to who you'll in your spirit to aim at what you get out of the service is up to you who you lend your spirit to if you lend your spirit to the world and the things of the world and the thoughts of the world and label to see it lukewarm spirit then you're not gonna get nothing out of a service but if you begin to realize there's another spirit here and if I can get into that and begin to worship that and let God come and begin to reveal himself to me if I can yield myself to that spirit then I can go out of here deliver it then I can go out of here healed then I can go out of here save then I can go out of here set free but you got to get into the Spirit of God there has to be something that you got to do he says we cannot have a last day until people get in the spirit of the last day and we can see that all around us people are in the spirit of the last day now they may think they're in the spirit of having fun or or are you know drinkin or whatever but they are actually getting to the spirit of destruction amen God is sending the destruction upon this earth and people are getting into the spirit of it they were getting into the lukewarmness are getting the spirit of sodom and gomorrah it's all around us amen to where it's not in the closet no more but it's out in the front it's pushed on every corner why because people are getting in the spirit of it hey man that's why I was warning a young man yesterday just a few days ago amen he's fixing to go to college that said you need to watch out when you go to those places because their spirits there and their spirits are trying to tear it down Christianity tear down what God is pricing in two positions and try to tear down creation and tear down all things that has to do with God but you better make sure you got the Spirit of God inside of you and if you have that he'll keep you in the middle of all those things if he yield yourself to the Spirit of God the spirit of the Antichrist cannot have control or dominion over you a man who says we cannot have a healing service until people get in the spirit of a healing service we cannot have a feeling of a feeling of the Holy Ghost until people get in that kind of atmosphere you know we can't even have a good service on Wednesday night until people get into the spirit that we're gonna have a good service on a Wednesday night amen it takes some moving you got to move away from your thoughts and from your ideas and who you think what's going on tomorrow and get into the spirit of what God is doing amen I don't know I'm not here to try to work you up or try to get you into some shout no I'm not interested in what I'm interested in is getting you into the Spirit of God and let the Spirit of God fall upon you and then healing to take place deliverances are take place marriages will be put back together God moving in your heart Amen but you have to move hey man the people was in that he said that we cannot have a feeling of the Holy Ghost until people get in that kind of that kind of atmosphere the people was in the atmosphere in that day to bring judgment upon the earth and they're in the same East about Noah's day in the snaring the same atmosphere today eating drinking Maron given and married all kinds of things going on and the glory of God is being preached and demonstrated and the power of the Holy Ghost setting forth an example of the preservation of Jesus Christ that's going to take the church in the glory just as certain as I'm standing here and men are ignoring it and paying no attention to it and walking away from it why because they are in the spirit of the last day hey man listen I don't want to come to church and be in the spirit of some other thing and miss God's Spirit amen I don't want to come to church and let some spirit dominate me of depression or fear anxiety or whatever the lukewarmness hi I want to cast all that society man I want to lay it all aside that's what they had to do in the Upper Room Amen they had to lay aside every division every spirit everything that was against God and they got in one mind and one a court and the power of God fell upon them the Spirit of God fell in their lives hey that's what we're designed an evening like tabernacle we're not interested in just a service or just a church we're interested in the Spirit of God being in our midst we're interested in being our cars and being in our homes being in our lives being an every part that we have him in the world's got to get like this he meant so if the world is getting in the spirit what's the bride doing hey man we see the world fulfilling that they're getting into it you can see it on the outward appearance you you can see it and everything that they are and do and portray you can see it in our Congress they're getting in the spirit of destruction amen you can see Russia they're getting in the spirit a man of what's going to take place in the bombs that's going to fall it has happening people are getting in the spirit of it it's going to take places prophecy there's nothing we can do to stop it there's not enough sermons we can do to stop it is going to take place but if they're getting in the spear and you're seeing lukewarmness and Laodicea and you're seeing the Sodom and Gomorrah conditions and the people in their place in the spirit how much more should we be in the Spirit of God amen the holy ghosts in our lives and the Holy Ghost moving and changing us and the Holy Ghost saving our young people and the Holy Ghost saving our marriages amen when all hell does against them there is a power that can save those things let's see we got to get in the spirit of it the world's got to get like this God would be unjust to Poor's wrath out opponent just people they have ignored him and walked away and Satan's captured them hey man that can happen right here in this service two people can ignore him and walk away and sit and capture them until they're soaked bound by spirit and you don't know if they're ever get loose from that thing they're there and they're there standing at that time but God has provided a way of escape how many wants to know the way of escape from the spirit of this world by being born again by receiving his spirit that's how you can escape the spirit of this world the spirit of this world is very strong Amen I'm not here to try to act like it's nothing it's a strong spirit one of the strongest spirits has ever been on this earth is this last day spirit it takes me and it takes women listen this spirit don't even care if you believe the message as long as you don't grab a hold of certain things it's a strong spirit mercy I I get amazed as we go along it just grieves me I'm telling my grieved I think brother Tim made reference this the other day but you hear it more and more people in the message becoming pro-choice they're not in the message or well the message is not in them hey man they might have a profession they might have a dress they might have an action or whatever as far as just their outward appearance but something's lacking on the inside of them it's impossible to believe that and be a Christian much less a minute message believer a man and I you know it's I just say that's not the only spirit that's prevalent we have the other spirits that are prevalent this art world as a spirit now that's trying to take over young minds as they're pushing it on everything through all kinds of news and all kinds of media and everything you know trying to get their ideas and it's washing away washing away washing away ain't meant to where people are now amen and message peers becoming vegans when the Bible axis absolutely calls it what it is amen he came down and showed Peter don't call what I call clean don't call it unclean he said slay and eat but that's the spirit a man it's not the spirit of this message it's not the spirit of this prophet it's not the spirit of the Holy Ghost it's a Laodicean spirit and we take that thing into our self and before we know it we're swamp right into the whole thing it's becoming more and more prevalent in message ranks why because they've listened to another spirit hey man revelations he says here in revelations 15 3 it says and they sang a song a memo I haven't skipped a little bit let me go back says he says right here we've got to get in the spirit of the last days when the spirit when this last days are here he says you go to a dance hall you go to get in the spirit of dancing or they won't or they won't dance you go to church you got to get in the spirit of worship before you can worship the world's got to get in the spirit of the last days before the last days can come and we're in the spirit of the last days and God promised that in these things would be here and that's what we got and men or women are sitting asleep and don't realize it we don't realize how late we're in a men I have been coming out of this pulpit of the token of the of the Exodus listen what's the time we're in him a man about 400 years went by but finally somebody got in the spirit of an exodus I believe those are people here tonight they're in the spirit amen not available to see it but in a spirit of leaving here this world is not my home I'm just passing through I'm a stranger I'm a foreigner here this is not what I want anymore I'm looking for another place amen in revelations 15 3 it says they sang the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the lamb saying great and marvellous so that works Lord God Almighty just and true that ways thou king of saints do you see it the lamb the high priest holding his blood as an atonement on the mercy seat for our sins is the Lord God Almighty that's his present office that is what he's doing now pleading his blood for our sins but one day the lamb will become Lion of the tribe of Judah he will come forth and power and glory and take his authority to reign as king he is the coming king of this earth of course that does not say he's not our King now for he is our King king of saints but right now it is a spiritual Kingdom it is not of this world system even as we are not of this world hallelujah the reason we act different from the world our citizenship is of heaven we reflect the spirit of the world of our rebirth where Jesus is King whoo hallelujah that is where our spirit is reacting reflecting is not of this world it's not of the things of this world it's not of the Creed's of this world it's not of the world but for the thoughts of this world it is reflecting another Kingdom that is coming upon the earth he said that is why women don't not dress the men's clothes or cut their hair or use all these cosmetics or other things that's well that ought to cover everything some people say when you say makeup well hanga cosmetics and all of the things that the world likes so much the world likes so much the world likes so much the world likes so much why is it in our ranks because all of them that were in Israel we're not of Israel you're not of us until you're born of the same spirit hey man this is why our men don't drink in the smoke and carry on and sin our Dominion is the dominion over sin and it is enforce to the power that is in the Spirit of Christ that indwells us each Kingdom on earth is going to be torn down but ours will remain hallelujah ours will remain that's why you would say in Romans 8 verse 1 there is therefore no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen for the law of the spirit of life is Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death and what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in this flesh and the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they they're after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh oh yes they that are other spirit of this world mind the things of this world but they that are after spirit amen the spirit of Christ that they are they do mind the things of the Spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because carnal mind is enmity against God for it's not subject to the law neither can it indeed can it be the so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but ye are not in the flesh am I talking to anybody tonight but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ he's none of his so he was saying like this in a prayer Oh God in the name of Jesus Christ saturate this building with your spirit Oh Oh God in the name of Jesus Christ saturate this building with your spirit throw every chunk out throw every log out may the God of heaven filled with the Holy Ghost and set this church of fire well how many can say man so get in the spirit of this meeting and every one of you will be healed in the name of Jesus Christ mercy there it is hallelujah do believe it are you in the spirit of receiving I think that's my problem any times we wonder why some services are so high and some are so low because some would come with the spirit of receiving and some we come with another spirit somewhere our minds are all somewhere we got tomorrow we got this but if we can just tune in for this next 45 minutes an hour and a half five hours whatever God wants to do hey man let's let him be gone amen let's let him direct about whatever it is but I want to be in the spirit of receiving you can never received anything from God until you receive his spirit and you say God I want to be ready for you when you come and it comes in the most odd times he comes when you're not expecting it he comes when you're not feeling it he comes when the right when everything seems all hell broke loose against you gotta come on the sea but you better be ready to say Here I am Lord Alleluia revelations 1 and verse 10 said I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and then there's another part and heard behind me a great voice as I was a hub as of a trumpet brother Branham says it like this I was in the spirit man how many could say I was in the spirit isn't that just beautiful my love that you could just call those words the whole of Christian life man I figured I'd get a little bit more a man's in there I was in the spirit he said you could call that those words the whole of Christian life if we were going to live as Christians we have to be in his spirit amen John was not talking about being in his own spirit that would not have brought these visions it had to be the Spirit of God it has to be the Spirit of God with us two or all our efforts is in vain Paul said I pray in the spirit I sing in the spirit I live in the spirit I come to church in the spirit hallelujah if there's any good thing that will come to me it has to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by His Word and made manifest by the result since bears and surely as John needed to be in the spirit to receive those tremendous revelations fresh from Jesus we need to be in the spirit to understand the revelations that God has given us to live by in his word for it is the same spirit but that's the problem we got it mixed up we want the word we won't really nothing but intellectual ideas but if you're getting the spirit of it then it'll be true revelation don't on your heart look at it this way he says all too many times in the Bible where it says in acts 2:38 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins you shall how many could say shall shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and it just passes right on you don't see it if they saw it by getting in the spirit they would know that it would they would want to receive the Holy Spirit then they need to repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then God would be duty-bound to fulfill his word by filling them with the Holy Ghost never get in his spirit or it would happen to them exactly as the word says pray to God for revelation by his Spirit that's the first step get in the spirit not your human spirit but his spirit hey man let me just use another illustration suppose you need healing what does the word say well we've read it countless time but did not get into the spirit when reading it he's the Lord God who hears all my diseases by His stripes I am healed and we're so mechanical we can quote it we've quoted it for years till we got that like we said Sunday we got so much the mechanics that we become mechanical we can quote it we can quote it we can call it he says but what happened did you ask God for His Spirit to teach us the real truth of it he says if we did we would call the elders confess our sins be anointed and prayed for and that would be that Amen it might not come immediately but it's spit and it's in his spirit it's all over in his spirit it's all over hey man there is no other Court of Appeal God will fulfill his work all we need to get in the spirit and then the things will be done don't go through the acts first get in the spirit and then go through the acts you know that's what's wrong with our services sometimes we want to come to church then get in the spirit but we need to get in the spirit and then come to church amen we want the preachers of the song leader to sing then we'll get in the spirit no we need to get in the spirit and sing with the song leader we want the preacher to preach and then get in the spirit no we need to get in the spirit and let the preacher preach and say yes Lord I see what you're talking about I receive it in the name of Jesus hallelujah we have to do the add we got to get in the spirit first then go through the act hallelujah have you ever noticed how the world's getting in the spirit of things that are in the world have anybody noticed that I've been talking about it have anybody out there noticed it mercy they're getting some kind of spirit they walk out and they got all kinds of junk all over their noses all I can look is like man that had to hurt how no I still still got a hurt how they how they doing that and then all the tattoos and all the stuff they got purple hair this and that in the other what is it they're getting into a spirit is this manifesting on them a man in it and you ain't got to tell them about it or tell them the shirt or shouldn't it just starts happening why because they received a spirit and that spirit starts acting out of their body starts overtaking it it's a spirit just like a cancer you know brother Brandon was far as I know in the first to begin to recall that what it was there wasn't a sickness it was a spirit and he would talk about he said that's a demon that's come there and anointed a cell he said but by the power of God we can cast that thing off anybody realized what it was it was a spirit hey man and it's the spirit that once ignored people do not receive anything from God when they come the house of God it's the spirit that wants to know people to do the things that are doing today it's a spirit that's trying to anoint you which spirit is it tonight hey man there's one there's a battle going on in this service we've called it it's a contest going on right now there's a new spirits that work in this service right now which one are you going to receive which one are you want to give yourself to which one are you going to yield yourself to if I was you I would yield myself to the Holy Ghost and let the Holy Ghost salt on you let him move on you let him reveal it to you I think I can preach I can stream I could holler I could read quotes I could read scriptures but if the Holy Ghost don't come in this place it's all forward it's all no it's nothing to it but I believe he is here and I believe with all my heart there's are people to receive him hallelujah but people are in the spirit they go to their ball games and sporting events and dances they enter into the spirit of it a man they don't sit a wall fires an old dried up sticks they enter right into the feel of things and become a part of things you can see them before you even get to the stadium miles hundreds of miles these flags have been going all kinds of stuff written all over the cars go this go that whatever they're going after do this win big do this test state state and it ain't just colleges or anything it's Little League it's all kinds of stuff they're getting in the spirit of something hey man you can get into the spirit of a lot of things don't have to be just sports hey man okay they enter right into the field things to become part of things is that all I'll hate how they hate the Christians for getting into the spirit of God's Word they called us fanatics and holy rollers there's nothing they don't do to show their hatred and disapproval but ignore that amen you can expect it knowing where it's coming from just go on and get in the spirit of worship hey man brother branham ignore that just go and get in the spirit of worship because our spirit is clean it's fresh it's real it's sober and serious but nonetheless full of the joy of the Lord the Christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of his pleasure in the Lord as the world is when it savers and delights in his present pleasures both Christians and the world were human both have emotion the differences Christians hearts and emotions are purely on Lord of glory and his love while the world satisfies the flesh amen I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day the first thing you have to do is what there you go somebody's listening get in the spirit how these houses revelation is going to ever come to you get in the spirit how you're ever going to get the Holy Ghost hey man it ain't a dried confession it ain't a preacher beating you on the back and a preacher praying for you it's you I got to get I got to be longing inside of your heart greater than the things of this world greater than what you have when you go back to your bedroom or to your house or do your car it's got to be a greater desire hey man he says listen he says what happens that when you was a sinner and you went to a dance you got in the spirit of it you started clapping your hands and patting your feet and shin digging no shin digging at in other words he was getting way down if he was digging your shins in throwing your hat on the floor going around around acting silly so you was in the spirit of it could you imagine a fella that was a dance team go to a dance and say well I guess y'all are having a pretty good time I suppose he's all they'd say all you want Wallflower get out of here get out of here you got a ball game somebody knock a whole road or something sit and look and say well guess that's pretty good no you wouldn't be a ball feel if you if you had that but you would be in the spirit of baseball when somebody knocks a hold on you raise up and holler my team's winning knock somebody's hat off his head nobody says a word about it but then in the church when you're getting the spirit and you begin to raise up and holler glory hallelujah praise God my team's waiting hallelujah my team's winners if God be for us who can be against us my team's winner no weapon formed against the shop husband my team's winner Amen somebody terrorists are you Holy Roller you hold her hold her he's I want to ask you a question if we're holy rollers because of what we do then that makes him unholy rollers I'd rather be a Holy Roller than an unholy Roller hallelujah John was in the spirit he got in the spirit then the things begin to take place he got enough spirit on the Lord's Day in other words his eyes turned from the old rotting I'll he was old and the teens he was going through in the scorpions and the snakes and all the problems around him he hauled his eyes faded away and all of a sudden he's standing in the Eternals Oh get in the spirit amen I believe that can happen for someone tonight it'll cause you to hear trumpet calls you to hear something hey man he was in the spirit and when he got there he heard a trumpet [Music] now trumpet always announces the approaching of something a king is coming they'll sound the trumpet and when Jesus approached she sounded the trumpet when Joseph went forth they sounded the trumpet now something's coming forward John got in the spirit and he heard a trumpet he heard a trumpet he took a look behind him and that but it was after he got in the spirit maybe he was dancing jumping running all over that aisle he was having a good time but he was in the spirit on the Lord's Day he wasn't running and jumping because amen there was a bunch of stones and scorpions and snakes like some of you would run and jump that one why he was running and jumping he was running and jumping because he was seeing things that wasn't in this dimension no more he was seeing the same God he had promised that would come again and he saw the one that was once was dead but it's not alive forevermore he saw the one who raised up from the grave and he saw he still lives today he saw the one that has cinder and he saw he still lives today he's I believe he's having a good time in the spirit just praising God because that's exactly what happened when the spirit fell on them in the first place when the Holy Ghost fell on them they staggered like drunk men and women and acted like they was drunk jabberin carried on like that two people said these people are full of new wine that's the way they acted the first time so the spirit come on again he'll act the same way the next time so what we need is a drunk Church hey man there's a well there's a woman out there drunk on the sins she's drunk of the wine of her fornication she's getting in the spirit of it she's gonna move into her power she's getting into the spirit of it but there's also another woman on this earth that's drunk but any of whom fornications and sins and idolatry and lukewarm spirits she's drunk on the Holy Ghost and she can see things make man that's happening and going home she's not worried about the bombs dropping because the bomb eat for her she's not worried about anything that's going on in political realms because there really ain't about her she's getting out of here man if you can get in your mind that in just a few days we're leaving this place what a shopping time we can have if we can get you away from the things that's going on in your life and the scorpions and the snakes is trying to bite you and trying to come at you and trying to hold at your windows if you can get in the spirit long enough to realize I only have a few more days left I only have just a few more birthdays here few more weeks few more year whatever it is it's just a limited time hallelujah but that makes me want a shell because I know and at the same time my time is not limited I'm leaving here but there is a limited time for that devil that's snake and that scorpion that tormented Jonalyn honor it's gone and dead and ain't there no more but John stealing the Eternals hallelujah let's see little depression that thing that's holding you and trying to keep you bound one day its life stays here one day it's over with and they don't have no power anymore why are you shouting on the hills of glory it'll be burning in hell all those things you try to torment you if you can get in the spirit right now you can see that your enemy is already dead he's powerless he has no power over here he has lost his power hallelujah if that's the way they acted the first time he'll do it again the second time the third time the fourth time get in the spirit but he says beloved remember you the words which is spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ how that they told you they should be mockers in the last time you know what that tells me those markers have their last time who should walk up there only their own ungodly lusts they have their own last time these be they who separate themselves sensual having to do with the flesh physical having not the spirit but he beloved building up yourself on the most holy faith praying in the Holy Ghost praying in the spirit keep yourselves in the love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life but he told us he said that Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the book of Revelation shows how that Antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it make it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes Satan revealing his works the attempted destruction of God's fellow them and the attempted destruction that means he's not going to he going to attempt but he's not going to succeed he's gonna attempt to keep the Holy Ghost from me but he ain't going to succeed he's going to attempt to keep the healing off of him but he's not going to succeed he's going to attempt to keep your children bound and out there in sin but he's not going to succeed we're leaving here we're leaving a hoof behind if he did it the first time he'll do it the second time hey man but sea-fight said he can't stand it he knows that the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army whoa hallelu how many believes that an invincible army if they get the true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian to all now we're bringing it on down I thought it was the world no it's right in the church well you think we're crying out against these things because then we wouldn't be worried about it there's so much out there in the world but it's in the church why did Paul deal with the things he dealt with not because it was in the world he dealt with it because it was in the church why are they preaching it because it's in the church why are they screaming out I guess because it's in the church should be in the church but it's in the church the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church and by God's Spirit that's all the way you gonna have true determines by his spirit deserving and withstand the Antichrist spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will yes the definitely thwarted or defeated today as when Christ was stood his every effort to gain power for him in the desert Satan hates Revelation so it's Satan knows it takes the spirit to bring revelation so what is he doing in this hour he's trying to kill the spirit because he knows the word can come as far as idle man's mouth but if the spirit think there it can't bring life there's nothing the letter killeth but the spirit bring his life it takes both of them together but we can follow these two spirits in the church started as we said we can enable both worshipers both raising their hands on a Wednesday or Sunday having a sacrifice one relying on what they had done what they've done over here and I've done this and it's me it's I look what I've done God one able saying I ain't worthy there's nothing I got this worthy I can't do it it's impossible he comes all of a sudden out of the other canyons canes over here and he's got his man the most beautiful fruits he's worked hard he didn't do it hey brother I don't say he done it for God he worked his own works and they placed him just so beautifully on altar all those in here I've heard him I know what they sound like especially when one gets caught I said all of a sudden Abel had a revelation by the spirit he said he got him some kind of twine something he had maybe old vine and he put around his neck he comes dragging it up to his altar he's come bringing it up there and he laid it upon that altar Kenny looked over he's like wow in the world is going on you're able realize it has to be blood he got a revelation of what took to get them covered in the garden him and that God didn't slay him it was blood fig leaves didn't do it if flipping legs wouldn't do it tomatoes and grapes and everything else wasn't gonna do it it took blood and here Abel comes and brings it up there he looks around he finds him a rock and he just begins hacking at his throat glam crying out but round sad Lamba getting to speak in tongues he said just as our lamb said yeah the bustin I hear is he said blood begin to flow it begin to squirt all over him he said what happened Abel died with his sacrifice he died right there on his altar and that's where you gotta get brother the sister you got to be willing to die kill your own spirit kill your own thinking kill what you thought was right what you thought was wrong lay it all at the altar so you can get in the right spirit he saw in Jacob what was it one one of the birthright one despised the birthright Moses and Janus and Jambres all the way down to Judas and Jesus are those two spirits working all the way down through the church he said brother I'm said have you ever studied the history of revivals he said a revival signifies a move of God and power and every time God moves Satan is there to move also it never fails in the days of the what great Welsh revival most people don't know this but the insane asylums filled up quickly it was a great display of devil power to take away they're trying to take away the attention from God hello somebody then why are we surprised when they show up at a god field camp I'm gonna take the attention away from God it is written that Wesley's day the people would do most peculiar things that were definitely of Satan to try to mark the goodness power in Luther's day has said that the miracle of his ministry did not lie in the fact that he was successfully protesting the Roman Catholic Church but the method miracle lay in the fact he could and did stay sound insane amidst the fanatics who were often filled with and guided by wrong spirits and if you have been aware in this last day's ministry you'll have noted the same invasion of false and wicked spirits while we got so many doctors in the message because of false and wicked spirits it has to be that way now hope and trust your spiritual minded enough to get that and capitalize on it this is just to seal the point of the true and false vines the two seeds mingling and demonstrating the two spirits enter work let us look at first John 4:1 and for beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they of God because many false prophets are going out into the world hereby know ye or the Spirit of God every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God a man and every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God and this is that spirit of Antichrist wherever you've heard that it should come and even now already is in the world but year of God little children and have overcome them the Antichrist spirit because greater is he God's Spirit that's in you than he that's in the world Jude 3 4 and 12 says beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you the complet common salvation it was needful me to write to you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the Saints we got to be doing the same thing contending for the faith we have been brought back to the original church and we got to stand there and contend for it and fight for it's our god-given rights it's our god-given right for our young people to be filled with the Holy Ghost how dare some plan create a creed that are taken out of the church it is our god-given rights our heritage he said for there certain men he says not Saints crept in unawares those have not come into the fold by means of the door they got in another way they didn't come by the new birth they come a different way and therefore they're robbers they try to take out the worship they take out the blood they take out the atonement they take out the intercessor they take it out they're robbers why because they didn't come in the same door we who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness denying the whole each Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ these are spots in your feasts of charity when they feast with you feeding themselves without fear it cannot be denied in the face of these scriptures that the true church and the false church are intertwined and have been planted together but of different seeds is it all elective God beware study closely be careful work out your salvation with fear and trembling rely on God and be strong in his mind your adversary the devil is even now going about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour watching the prayer be steadfast this is the end time both the true and false vines are coming into maturity but before the wheat matures those ripened tears must be bound for the burning and their joining the World Council of Churches that's the vine and soon the garden of the we will come but right now the two spirits are into vines but come out from among the tears start to overcome that which you may consider praise whether if our Lord and be fit to reign and rule with him listen there's the age this age is the last of the seven churches well beginning the first or the Ephesian age must and will come to fruition and harvest in the last or Laodicean age so what I read it puts the harvest in the Laodicean age the two vines will yield their final fruit the two spirits will terminate their manifestations in each of their final destinations who the sowing the water the growing is over the summers in earth it ended in a sickle is now thrust into the harvest he says which we said we've studied lots of pictures of the ripe and false vine fall spirit for church people I know that works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that word cold or hot so that because our lukewarm neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because I say us I'm rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that that made us be rich white raiment that means be clothed that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint the eyes with I self that they may see no words ever spelled out a more bitter denunciation and no proud and arrogant religious people ever deserved it milk yet in verse 21 same age to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me and my throne y'all have been commissioned to be thrown sitters a man to have dominion and reign as kings and priests even as I overcame and sat down and my father and his throne you'ii find the true vine he just said it the true vine the true spirit the true church people exalted to the very throne of God with the highest compliment ever paid to a humble steadfast spiritual group so if we're not that who was it I am that that is my promise hallelujah amen the mysteries of the tear and wheat in Matthew 13:24 is now also fulfilled another parable put forth with him saying the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man who sowed a good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and sword tears into the among the wheat and went his way and when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also so the servants of the household come and said sir did it sound so good seeding that field from whence hath the tears come from he said an enemy has done this the said it wilt thou then go and gather them up he said nay lest while you gather up the tares you root up the wheat with and why because in that stage they both look the same but your little mature and the spirit that's in there is going to manifest their final destination the final destination will be the end I'll drop the mic on who the bride of Christ is a man that's what is going to be and then others will be cast out into wailing and gnashing of teeth but from the latter stage they've grown side by side and this ages are harvested what now I see us set out to accomplish has finally come to pass with all the might of the organization the false church turns away from the vestige of truth with political might reinforces herself with state back and sets out to eradicate forever the true believer just when she's about to accomplish her cowardly plot the wheat has gathered into the garner hallelujah no longer will the wheat and tares grow side by side no longer with a tear to receive the blessing of God because of the presence of the wheat for the wheat will be gone and the wrath of God will be poured out amen which were in in the utter destruction of the wicked he said I said not long ago about the false vine coming to full fruition in this age her fruit would mature and ripen that's correct the evil spirit of church full of iniquity will be revealed as a mustard seed that grew into a tree which large the fowls of the air at her head will be the Antichrist the mystery of iniquity all this is true and if this is true then must be also true that the bride church will mature her ripeness shall be the identification with her Lord by the means of the word in her head who will come for her in the mystery of godliness witches indeed cries and as the false church was all cut honest and diabolical power made a political force physical force and demons of darkness will come against this true vine and this true vine with the fullness of the Spirit and the word will do the very acts of the power that Jesus did then as she nears her head so becoming like him through the word Jesus will become the bride and the groom may be forever United as one when in the rapture but in Revelations 322 he says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit capitalist spirit saith unto the churches can you hear what the Spirit is saying get under the blood get the token receive Christ don't receive just a doctrine a creature a way of living receive him serves we should see Jesus that's what we want to see this is the last warning he says there not be another the throne room has been set up the twelve foundations have been laid think of this just leave 17500 highway 371 for a moment the streets of gold have been paved the gates of gigantic pearls are raised in hinge like a pyramid she stands so fair and glorious the heavenly beings who have prepared her watch breathlessly as she glistens and shines with a glory that is unearthly every facet of her being tell Beauty tells a story of amazing grace in Jesus love she's a city prepared for a prepared people who got their lamps trimmed and clear got the blood on the door she waits only for her inhabitants and soon they will throng her streets with joy yes it's the last call the spirit will not speak in another age the ages are over what the ages is over but but thank God at this moment the age is not over he is yet crying and his cries not only in the spirit its cries not only in the spiritual ears of men by a spirit once again a prophet is in the land once more God will reveal the truth as he did to Paul in the days of the seventh messenger in the days of the Laodicean age and it's messenger will reveal the mysteries of God as revealed to Paul - Paul he will speak out and those who receive that prophet well in his own name will receive the beneficent effect of that prophecy ministry and they that hear him will be blessed and become part of that bride of the last day who are mentioned in revelation 22:17 the spirit and the bride say come the court of weed the bride we that fell on the ground at nazia has come back to original word drain again praise God forever yes listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in this lesson what he says from God the bride will say hello somebody what he says from God the bride will say if they're saying something that the Prophet didn't say it ain't the Spirit of God and the spirit and the Prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing hallelujah and what they will say will have already been said in the word do you see all the checks and balances that have been given to us in this message but how many people just run right over and get one little quote in a quiet place place it over here with another and they get another lease places together but he said the spit of the Spirit of will be set on the bride and the Prophet where then the Spirit will be saying the same thing and then he makes another statement and what they say the word will have been saying Eva's have said if you can't find it in the word you can't find it in the message it ain't the word hey man you might can find it on tape but if it ain't in the Bible it ain't the message hey man this is what the message came to reveal it can't reveal anything outside this book he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit says the Spirit has spoken the Setting Sun is about to fade into eternity for the church age then it will be all over then it'll be too late to come if somewhere in this books of this series God has dealt with you brothers may even now turn to him in repentance and give all your life to him that by his Spirit he may give you eternal life he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit says if that spirit is saying something that's not in the Bible he ain't the right spirit it's the spirit of a man or the spirit of a devil that's taking him whatever but it ain't the Spirit of God because God will never never never deny his word what do you say those are some of those things you said we're Laodicean spirits how do you know that that's what it is because it's against the Word of God but he that hath an ear let him hear I mean he's got to ear tonight I'm thankful I got to hear ear to hear what the Spirit says this bar hallelujah honor how many would just say you know brother Timothy I've been in the wrong spirit I've allowed something to come in I've been listening to the wrong voice say it to God said Lord aah I just want to repent let my ear return to yours what your spirit says yes Lord let me hear what the Spirit is saying let me hear what you say Lord what's your word declares father seeing the hands that were up the hearts that were murdered help us to be a church Lord that can be moved by your spirit or helped me to be somebody Lord that when you move and I feel you come by and you speak that I ain't just sleeping or ignoring you my

I say Lord I want to be moved by you on them moving to your realms of your faith and your love and your mercy and your grace Lord that you can just anoint me as you did Paul and Peter and John and all those men Lord is we've come back to those days again I believe there's people here the vessels Lord that were just like those on the day of Pentecost Lord they're wanting and ready to be filled Lord there's also others that need to refill in Lord we can have theology we can have doctrines we can have words if we ain't got your spirit we have nothing and I have the Holy Ghost Lord in our lives may we all take stock and get in the spirit of leaving here Lord sometimes we get so caught up in the spirit of staying and abiding plant and potatoes and corn the lord help us to get in the spirit of leaving here or a rapture to take place there's going to be a people in the spirit of a rapture there's going to be a people in the spirit of expectation a body changes that take place I'm just asking the Lord that your Holy Ghost so just fall upon our lives or that you just take and burn out the old dross and the unleavened out of our lives Lord nor that you would begin to blow through our hearts and blow out all the dirtiness and all the dark places Lord and all the spirits are trying to hold skeletons and clauses made us all be moved out and let your presence come in and feel every fiber or we believe we're in those days again we're just asking you to move father we're asking you to touch hearts and lives I believe tonight Lord hearts can be so touched so there will never be the same ever again Lord Lord I believe hearts can be changed just in a moment in your presence Holy Ghost can fall upon a heart Lord it'll be all over all their doubts and fears and unbelief and worrying
