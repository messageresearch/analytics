[40:40] you would touch each and every heart
[40:42] Lord if there be depression is trying to

[41:26] doesn't matter what kind of circumstance
[41:28] we find ourselves in he's still good

[41:42] known unto God and the peace of God
[41:44] which passes all understanding keep your
[41:48] hearts and minds through Christ Jesus
[41:50] finally brethren whatsoever things are
[41:53] true whatsoever things are honest
[41:55] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[41:57] things are pure whatsoever things are
[42:00] lovely whatsoever things are of good
[42:02] port if there be any virtue if there be
[42:06] any praise think on these things those
[42:10] things which you've both learned to
[42:11] received and heard and singing me do and
[42:14] the God of peace shall be with you he
[42:18] meant I'm thankful for the God of peace
[42:20] Amen we let you be seated this this
[42:25] thought has been on my heart this week
[42:26] is you know how it is your mind that
[42:30] devil wants to try to get you on every
[42:32] sad news or bad news or every kind of
[42:34] thing that comes up and pops up and and
[42:37] news articles or self-help whatever so
[42:41] many things right now especially is
[42:43] being put out there and and and so I
[42:46] begin to think on the word of what God
[42:49] told us to do and he said whatsoever
[42:52] things are honest whatsoever things are
[42:54] just pure lovely and of good report if
[42:57] there be any virtue or praise think on
[43:00] these things and I I'd like to speak to
[43:03] you tonight on something worth thinking
[43:05] talking and posting about Amen been
[43:10] posting about you have to update it
[43:11] sometimes because now they have weird
[43:13] and the day age we live in there's a lot
[43:15] of social media and and it's got as good
[43:19] their ways we use it for the glory of
[43:21] God but it's also got the bad things it
[43:23] comes along with it just like anything
[43:25] off the tree of good and good and
[43:27] knowledge of good or the knowledge of
[43:28] good and evil but you know I think in
[43:32] this time that we're in especially even
[43:35] more important than ever is to just to
[43:38] get to thinking about Christ is to keep
[43:41] him on your mind you know as we said
[43:44] that there be any praise if there be any
[43:46] virtue think on these things and you
[43:49] know brother Brennan would speak upon
[43:50] thoughts and negative thoughts and
[43:53] positive thoughts and and you know right
[43:56] now there's plenty of negative to think
[43:57] about there's plenty of negative this
[43:59] throat up in your face either by what
[44:02] somebody says or a text or a post and
[44:06] things are getting shared around that we
[44:07] don't even know it really true or not
[44:09] but you know or passed on as being the
[44:11] truth but I do know one thing
[44:13] this word is true
[44:14] as word as has never failed amen and I
[44:17] said still producing even in this time
[44:20] that we're living in you know and he
[44:22] said you know when you have a thought
[44:23] coming if it's a negative thought he
[44:26] says to get it off your mind think on
[44:28] things that's positive never let a
[44:31] negative thoughts stop keep thoughts
[44:33] positive Jesus and I believe that
[44:36] there's a thought that we ought to be
[44:37] thinking on right now that's Jesus
[44:39] because what he has done for us he's
[44:41] never left us alone he's been there for
[44:43] us every step of the way and I don't see
[44:46] him leaving us now I don't see him
[44:48] moving away from us now but he's ever
[44:50] with us as his word promised he would be
[44:53] and he said you know don't think sitting
[44:55] there in a wheelchair or well I'll just
[44:57] say whatever position or place whether
[44:59] it be maybe a financial situation or
[45:02] whatever struggle he said don't don't
[45:04] sit there thinking you're hopeless don't
[45:07] sit there thinking that you're helpless
[45:09] you're not don't let that negative
[45:12] thought pass through and let know
[45:14] especially don't let it anchor there he
[45:16] said sometimes you can't help it from
[45:18] coming through your mind but that's
[45:20] that's right but don't let it stay there
[45:22] amen turn to something that's positive
[45:25] he said you know it's like an old farmer
[45:27] he said I can't keep birds from flying
[45:29] over my place or my house he said but I
[45:31] can kinda have a double-barrel shotgun I
[45:34] can sure keep them from roosting he said
[45:37] you do the same thing don't let that
[45:39] thought roost there and begin to breed
[45:41] more negative thoughts amen he says
[45:44] here's a shotgun to use you have the
[45:46] both the New and Old Testament a
[45:48] double-barrel shotgun and he said is
[45:50] still as potent today as it ever was it
[45:54] keeps him all away you know
[45:56] blind Bartimaeus was sitting there in
[45:58] his blind condition and a very seemingly
[46:00] terrible place and it was a terrible
[46:02] place born blind but he said what
[46:05] happened was he begin to think and he
[46:07] and he said thoughts begin to pass
[46:09] through his mind and he's you know
[46:11] thoughts of if I could have been there
[46:12] when the great prophets of the Walker
[46:14] when if I could have been there you know
[46:17] for in the times of the prophets or have
[46:20] one of them pray for me and I believe
[46:22] Jehovah would give me a sight and he
[46:24] says you know we said in that same place
[46:26] amen and our meditations and sometimes
[46:29] our meditations are thinking about
[46:31] church affiliations or our meditation is
[46:34] taken by work or some superstition we
[46:37] have in our mind and and man but then we
[46:39] but if we can take them from that and
[46:41] place our meditation upon him and its
[46:44] presence he will come and do the same
[46:47] thing he did for blind bartimaeus if he
[46:50] would do that
[46:51] amen if we can do that if we could keep
[46:53] him on our mind and right right now
[46:56] Satan's having a heyday with people in
[46:58] their thoughts in their mind and the
[47:00] things that they're going through and be
[47:02] putting these sad weary spirits of
[47:04] depression and things upon them but you
[47:06] have to turn from that and think about
[47:08] what Jesus has done what Jesus is doing
[47:11] and what Jesus is going to do because he
[47:14] has a come upon in our lives he saved us
[47:16] when we was lost he healed us when we
[47:18] were sick and he's going to change it so
[47:21] vile body one of these days and he
[47:23] noticed when they was walking on the
[47:24] road to Emmaus and it was when they
[47:27] begin to think on the things of God and
[47:29] they begin speaking about him that's
[47:31] when he appeared to him amen we got our
[47:34] minds he says onto many things of the
[47:36] world oh my that's true today we got our
[47:39] mind so many things with too many things
[47:41] of the world he said if we could just
[47:43] throw that away for a moment and think
[47:45] about him and his soon coming he said
[47:48] there'd be more revelations and power in
[47:51] the church hallelujah
[47:53] I believe that's what our goal and our
[47:55] ambition should be during this time it's
[47:58] not to get our mind on the world events
[48:00] and you know we get in full and fine
[48:02] being formed but don't let that be all
[48:04] that you feed upon all that you're out
[48:06] drawing from but get your mind on Jesus
[48:09] turn back to the Word of God and feed on
[48:12] the word of God and feed on the things
[48:15] of God and let God speak to you during
[48:18] these moments hey man we begin to think
[48:20] about him he said when we keep thinking
[48:23] about you know what am I gonna do
[48:24] tomorrow what I'm gonna go do next week
[48:26] will I hold my job well it will I people
[48:28] will they sink me for provided he said
[48:31] get your mind off of them and
[48:33] on things that are in the hands all
[48:35] things are in the hands of God
[48:37] hallelujah all things are in the hands
[48:40] of God this world has not jumped out of
[48:42] the hands of God now and in somebody
[48:44] else's hands everything is working
[48:46] according to his plan he's got it all in
[48:49] control he's got to know he put it there
[48:52] in place he put the stars in the place
[48:54] he put the Sun in his place and it's
[48:56] still there today by the spoken word of
[48:59] God and if he puts you in your place he
[49:01] puts you in your position you will be
[49:04] held there no matter what winds of Hell
[49:06] push against you no matter what doubts
[49:09] come no matter what floods come you will
[49:11] be held there by the Word of God

[56:06] hey man God wants us to be happy and to
[56:09] trust him in these times this was shared
[56:12] with us this - I believe it was today or
[56:15] yesterday evening with random speaking
[56:17] to a lady he said the lady suffers with
[56:21] extreme nervous condition she's wanting
[56:24] prayer for eyes because her eyes are
[56:26] getting dimmer and dimmer they're going
[56:29] out it's a hardening of the nerve of the
[56:32] eye the optical nerve is dying which is
[56:34] shutting off the life but you're all
[56:36] upset about something you're weary you
[56:40] even wonder if you're actually saved

[57:27] time after time after time and he's not
[57:29] going to stop now
[57:32] merciful God he said I stand before this
[57:35] dear woman knowing there's a sad spirit

[57:40] sad spirit around you but hear the
[57:42] prayer amen I asked for that divine
[57:44] mercy and guidance laying my hands upon
[57:47] her and I charged that sad spirit to
[57:50] leave the woman because Christ lives
[57:54] that's enough to drive the sadness away
[57:56] he still lives he's still on the throne

[58:04] can keep his promise he said I will
[58:06] never leave you or forsake you
[58:09] hallelujah Christ can no more take back
[58:12] a word though then he said to nothing
[58:14] because he's God he knows everything
[58:17] before he says it
[58:18] and he said I condemn the spirit that
[58:21] would harm this woman in Jesus name and
[58:25] I also condemn that old sad spirit that
[58:27] wants to come in our realms in these
[58:29] moments and push his way in and attach
[58:32] itself to some bad news or some little
[58:34] shake-up going on I condemn that thing
[58:37] and I Drive it out of homes drive it
[58:40] away from lives by driving away from
[58:42] hearts by the Word of God think on these
[58:45] things sums nineteen verse 14 said to
[58:51] let the words of the eye of my mouth and
[58:56] today we get updated and let the words
[58:58] of my keyboard and the meditation of my
[59:02] heart be acceptable in thy sight
[59:06] listen if words we speak and the people
[59:09] get the idea that somehow they're
[59:10] detached from what they post you're not
[59:13] detached from what you post people got
[59:16] that idea so
[59:17] anything behind a keyboard but you are
[59:19] very much attached to what it shows you
[59:21] what you really are
[59:22] I mean you can see it in people as they
[59:25] would comment on news articles or
[59:27] whatever you can see the bow that set is
[59:29] there they may be good Baptists may be
[59:31] good crew so-called Christians but in
[59:34] them in the middle of them a man there's
[59:36] something pushing out of him
[59:38] hatred and violence and all these kind
[59:41] of things there might be good message
[59:43] people come on now and they push it out
[59:47] let the words of my mouth and the
[59:49] meditation of my heart be acceptable in
[59:52] thy sight O Lord for mice you are my
[59:55] strength and my Redeemer
[59:57] Psalms 141 said set a watch o Lord
[1:00:00] before my mouth and keep the doors of my
[1:00:04] lips proverbs 6 2 says thou art snared
[1:00:07] with the words of our mouth and thou art
[1:00:09] taken with the words of thy mouth 13:33
[1:00:12] says he that keepeth his mouth keepeth
[1:00:15] his life but he that openeth why his
[1:00:18] lips shall have destruction proverbs 15
[1:00:21] forces a wholesome tongue or is a
[1:00:24] healing or health tongue a healing
[1:00:28] tongue is a tree of life but
[1:00:31] perverseness therein is a breach in the
[1:00:33] spirit 18:21 says death and life are in
[1:00:36] the power of the tongue so it's very
[1:00:38] important what we speak or what we say
[1:00:41] just because of the thought that enters
[1:00:43] your mind don't mean it's the word
[1:00:45] that's got to come out of your mouth or
[1:00:47] a word there's got to be put out there
[1:00:49] on the on a forum somewhere some social
[1:00:51] media for Matthew 12 verse 37 says for
[1:00:54] by thy words thou shalt be justified and
[1:00:58] by thy words thou shalt be condemned so
[1:01:03] we don't want a negative testimony
[1:01:07] Alleluia amen he would say this many
[1:01:12] times with libretto speaking about
[1:01:14] negative and positive
[1:01:15] he says if your number is called tonight
[1:01:18] in the prayer line if God reveals your
[1:01:20] heart and speaks to you and gives you
[1:01:21] deliverance in here don't ever have no
[1:01:25] kind of negative testimony but only he
[1:01:28] healed you
[1:01:30] because if you do if you one time
[1:01:33] testified to the other side the negative
[1:01:36] side it'll come back to you worse than
[1:01:38] it ever was
[1:01:39] let him this week say I'm strong but I
[1:01:44] don't feel strong he didn't say to him
[1:01:46] that feel strong say you're strong he
[1:01:48] said to him that's weak to him that
[1:01:51] knows him saying you know in humanity
[1:01:53] you find very quickly how fragile
[1:01:55] humanity really is you find real quickly
[1:01:58] how fragile our lives really are what we
[1:02:01] think are important or very fragile all
[1:02:03] we want is very fragile and one day can
[1:02:05] be there in the next day it'd be gold
[1:02:07] but let him that's weak say I'm strong
[1:02:12] because there's not me the liveth it's
[1:02:14] him that liveth within me just say in
[1:02:17] your heart now I'm strong I've now
[1:02:20] accepted Jesus as my healer and never
[1:02:23] have a negative testimony just believe
[1:02:25] it God is under obligation and Jesus our
[1:02:29] Jesus Christ is sitting at the right
[1:02:31] hand of the Father to accept you for
[1:02:33] he's sitting there is the high priest of
[1:02:35] your confession to make good before the
[1:02:37] father anything that he died for and
[1:02:39] that you're confessing that he done
[1:02:40] healing is not something that you say
[1:02:43] well I guess I believe it I believe he
[1:02:46] said that's all right if that's the best
[1:02:47] you can do mentally you know I see I
[1:02:49] believe I accepted that's then you're
[1:02:52] accepted on those basis keep saying it
[1:02:54] over and over and say it out loud say it
[1:02:59] over and over and just keep saying it
[1:03:02] I'm healing I'm healed I'm healed I'm
[1:03:05] healed some of you need to say I'm happy
[1:03:09] I'm happy I'm happy
[1:03:10] amen say it until you actually believe
[1:03:13] it and when you believe it something's
[1:03:15] going to take place don't have a
[1:03:18] negative testimony every time when you
[1:03:21] confess I feel bad you go right straight
[1:03:23] back to the same rut you was in the
[1:03:25] beginning there's not a man or woman
[1:03:27] here there's baptized with the Holy
[1:03:28] Spirit but what you start your
[1:03:30] convention I believe I've lost the Holy
[1:03:32] Spirit I believe it's gone from me he
[1:03:35] said but don't never
[1:03:36] have no negative testimony because you
[1:03:40] will go right down when you do testify
[1:03:44] positive jesus healed me I'm will go
[1:03:47] ahead and receive your healing no matter

[1:03:54] never going to receive it you got to go
[1:03:55] back every time do you have a you have a
[1:03:57] negative testimony every time you look

[1:16:15] and in that time there was a little
[1:16:17] woman that was preparing her last meal
[1:16:19] and she was making her last meal before
[1:16:21] hurting the boat was gonna starve to
[1:16:23] death but brother brother man spoke he
[1:16:25] said a prophet was sent out of the
[1:16:26] mountains where he'd been fed by some
[1:16:28] Ravens and a broken God said go to a
[1:16:30] certain town and in a certain town
[1:16:32] you'll find a certain woman and I asked
[1:16:35] her to make you a meal and when he came
[1:16:37] and she was standing there and she was
[1:16:39] gathered the last few sticks and getting
[1:16:41] the last bit of meal and the last bit of
[1:16:43] old and making last cake for the last
[1:16:46] meal and it was going to be over with
[1:16:47] and seemingly going to die God asked her
[1:16:50] a request give it to me trust me

[1:17:24] can do with it she gave her she made
[1:17:27] that last cake and gave it to that
[1:17:29] prophet she brother Branham said she
[1:17:33] must have been I believe he something
[1:17:34] like this he said of the same material
[1:17:37] of all as Elijah she believed in the
[1:17:40] middle of a crisis and you've been asked
[1:17:43] to believe not doubt not post doubts and
[1:17:47] fears and and worries and this that and
[1:17:50] the other I mean we can we can preach
[1:17:52] faith there in faith at times oh we can
[1:17:55] preach it but what about faith during
[1:17:57] the time of crisis what about speaking
[1:18:01] faith in the time that that my goodness
[1:18:04] toilet paper is gone and things off the
[1:18:05] store is gone and situations are
[1:18:07] happening maybe we losing jobs and I
[1:18:09] don't know what's going to happen all I
[1:18:11] know is nobody God hadn't left or left
[1:18:13] somebody else in charge he's still got
[1:18:16] it in
[1:18:16] trol he's the one who spoke this thing
[1:18:20] into existence he's gonna bring him back
[1:18:22] down to the right kind of end and the
[1:18:24] right time and although it's in his I

[1:18:29] knitted for government it's not in
[1:18:31] anybody's head it's only in his hands
[1:18:34] and she gave him the last and then in
[1:18:39] turn he gave her a meal barrel that
[1:18:40] wouldn't run out in a cruise all crews
[1:18:44] of jug or whatever they used a little
[1:18:45] maybe a pottery and every time she'd go
