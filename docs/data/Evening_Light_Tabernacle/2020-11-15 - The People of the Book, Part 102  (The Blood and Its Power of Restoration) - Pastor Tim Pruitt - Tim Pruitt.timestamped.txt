[45:40] this morning
[45:41] as we look into the word of god and
[45:43] praying that the lord will speak to
[45:45] hearts and lives
[45:47] amen as we minister from this scripture
[45:50] today
[45:50] revelation 5 verse 1
[45:53] and i saw in the right hand of him that
[45:56] sat upon the throne a book written
[45:58] within and on the backside sealed with
[46:00] seven seals
[46:02] i just never get tired of this scene
[46:05] and i saw a strong angel and i can hear
[46:08] the prophet of god
[46:09] say it as he comes across this
[46:12] very place he said oh maybe i'm i'm just
[46:15] feeling this way
[46:17] but let him let him come forth and take
[46:20] the book
[46:21] and to loosen the seals saying who is
[46:24] worthy with a loud voice
[46:26] he was saying proclaiming with the loud
[46:28] voice who is worthy
[46:29] to open the book and the loose the seals
[46:32] thereof
[46:34] and no man in heaven nor in earth
[46:37] neither under the earth was able to open
[46:39] the book
[46:40] neither to look their own and i wept
[46:42] much because no man
[46:44] was found worthy to open the book and to
[46:47] read the book
[46:48] neither to look their own and one of the
[46:51] elders said unto me
[46:52] weep not behold the lion of the tribe of
[46:55] judah the root of david hath prevailed
[46:58] to open the book and to loose the seven
[47:00] seals thereof
[47:02] and i beheld in low in the midst of the
[47:05] throne and of the four beasts
[47:07] and in the midst of the elders stood a
[47:10] lamb as it had been slain having seven
[47:12] horns and
[47:13] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[47:16] of god sent forth into all the earth
[47:18] and he came and took the book out of the
[47:22] right hand of him that sat upon the
[47:23] throne
[47:24] and when he had taken the book the four
[47:26] beasts and four and twenty elders fell
[47:28] down before the lamb having ever one of
[47:30] them harps
[47:31] and golden vials full of voters which
[47:34] are the prayers of the saints
[47:36] and they sung a new song saying thou art
[47:38] worthy to take the book and to open the
[47:40] seals thereof
[47:42] for thou was slain and has redeemed us
[47:44] to god by thy blood
[47:45] out of every kindred and tongue and
[47:47] people and nation
[47:49] and has made us unto our god kings and
[47:52] priests and we shall
[47:53] reign on the earth and i beheld and i
[47:57] and i heard the voice of many angels
[48:00] round about the throne and the beast and
[48:02] the elders and the number of them was
[48:04] ten thousand times ten thousand and
[48:07] thousands of thousands saying with a
[48:09] loud voice
[48:10] worthy is the lamb that was slain to
[48:12] receive power and riches and wisdom and
[48:14] strength
[48:15] and honor and glory and blessing and
[48:18] every creature which is in heaven and on
[48:20] the earth
[48:21] and under the earth and such as our
[48:22] indices and all that
[48:24] are in them heard i say in blessing and
[48:27] honor and glory and power be unto him
[48:31] that sitteth upon the throne
[48:33] and unto the lamb forever and ever and
[48:35] the four beasts said amen
[48:36] and the four and twenty elders fell down
[48:38] and worshiped him that
[48:40] liveth forever and ever
[48:43] amen god bless you amen as you just
[48:46] read here today with me the great
[48:50] process of redemption
[48:53] amen we keep it in mind it is a process
[48:56] that begins with one sitting on the
[48:59] throne holding a book
[49:02] and continues on until the
[49:05] a lamb is slain and the slain lamb takes
[49:08] the book
[49:10] and then it continues on until all
[49:12] creation worships god
[49:15] amen so it is a process all till
[49:19] the renewal of the earth is made new
[49:22] again
[49:22] because it's all a part of the plan of
[49:24] redemption
[49:26] note the slain lamb the blood and its
[49:29] atoning thus
[49:30] cleansing power the cleansing power of
[49:33] the blood can
[49:34] never be over emphasized
[49:37] that's why i'm speaking this morning on
[49:39] the blood and its
[49:40] power of restoration the scripture said
[49:44] in
[49:45] revelation 1 5 he has washed us from
[49:48] our sins in his own blood
[49:53] revelation 5 it says that thou verse 9
[49:55] said that was slain and has redeemed us
[49:58] to god
[49:59] by thy blood out of every kindred and
[50:01] tongue and people and nation
[50:03] so we can see here that everything that
[50:06] he does in redemption is by his blood
[50:09] but without the shedding of blood there
[50:11] is no remission of sin
[50:14] and then finally our our overcoming
[50:18] comes by blood as it says in revelation
[50:20] 12 11 and they overcame him
[50:23] by the blood of the lamb
[50:26] so as we have been speaking in the last
[50:29] few days of
[50:30] and few services on worries that you're
[50:33] standing and
[50:34] what is our position and then we
[50:37] we are seeing that even heaven is doing
[50:40] something in this last day as things are
[50:44] moving
[50:44] and things are happening and and we see
[50:48] the lamb that was slain
[50:49] at calvary that he stands and
[50:54] in order and he stands in an order to be
[50:57] as
[50:57] for slain lamb to stand he has to be a
[51:01] resurrected lamb
[51:03] and he stood and he took the book and
[51:07] removes its seals
[51:10] and i think neither can we overemphasize
[51:13] the great
[51:13] god upon the throne how that he became a
[51:17] man
[51:18] to be the slain lamb for our sins
[51:22] was not a junior god that he sent or
[51:25] another god it was the very god
[51:28] who would be manifested in the flesh for
[51:31] our redemption
[51:33] the the fact that he was a man though it
[51:35] causes many to stumble
[51:38] even among believers they want to seem
[51:40] to want to seem
[51:41] only as as god and not as a man or only
[51:45] a man and not as god
[51:48] and and we we have you know the
[51:50] pentecostal oneness people who
[51:53] got a revelation of baptism in jesus
[51:56] name and one god and
[51:57] and whatever but they only saw him they
[52:00] only saw jesus
[52:01] as god they couldn't see his humanity
[52:05] and those who advocate a true lord
[52:07] doctrine can only see his humanity
[52:10] but brother branham made it clear that
[52:12] he was either deity or the biggest
[52:14] deceiver the world ever saw
[52:17] and he he would make these kind of
[52:19] statements as he approached the church
[52:21] ages and he said the first thing you've
[52:22] got to know
[52:24] is that he's not a prophet he's not a
[52:26] junior god he's not a secondary
[52:28] god he is god amen
[52:31] and he repeats he is god he would go on
[52:34] to say the greatest of
[52:36] all revelations is the deity the supreme
[52:41] deity of our lord jesus christ
[52:45] and he would say the first in all
[52:47] revelation is the deity the supreme
[52:49] deity
[52:50] of jesus christ i am he that was which
[52:53] is
[52:54] and shall come i am the first and the
[52:56] last
[52:57] the almighty and
[53:00] the word he would say in the church's
[53:02] book the words are he is the beginner
[53:04] our author of the creation of god will
[53:06] now we know of for a surety that jesus
[53:10] is god very god he
[53:13] is the creator now
[53:17] we can never over emphasize though too
[53:20] much upon
[53:21] christ's person as god
[53:24] and man you can overemphasize he was
[53:27] only god
[53:28] you can overemphasize he was just a man
[53:30] but you can't
[53:31] overemphasize too much his person as god
[53:35] and man he was man yet he was the very
[53:39] god of heaven
[53:40] he was called the mighty the man of
[53:42] sorrow and at the same time
[53:45] the almighty god over all
[53:48] blessed forever he who was despised
[53:52] and rejected of man was beloved and
[53:55] adored by angels
[53:57] the bible said the angels worshiped him
[54:00] and he who men hid their faces from him
[54:04] with contempt was as i said worshiped by
[54:07] cherubims and seraphims again
[54:10] this is the mystery of godliness that
[54:13] god was manifested in the flesh
[54:17] he who was god and yet in the beginning
[54:19] was with god
[54:21] as the logos the word whereby he created
[54:24] all things
[54:26] the word that would be made flash to
[54:29] dwell among us
[54:30] it was the highest stripping to become
[54:33] the lowest
[54:35] it was the greatest that was taking his
[54:37] place among the least
[54:39] the one who sat upon the well it's
[54:42] psycho
[54:43] and the one who said give me to drink
[54:46] to a woman there um a
[54:50] woman there at samaria was none other
[54:53] than he that digged the oceans
[54:56] the man who was of the substance of mary
[54:59] the seed and the egg being of god but
[55:02] yet
[55:02] the recipe of this seed and egg was mary
[55:06] from whom the substance taken from her
[55:08] body
[55:09] wrapped flesh around the blood cell of
[55:12] god
[55:13] his manhood was real and essential
[55:17] it differed from our own humanity and
[55:19] that he was sinless
[55:21] and he was born without sex yet
[55:25] he was born of a woman
[55:28] wrapped in swaddling cloths laid in a
[55:31] manger
[55:32] he needed to be nursed by a mother just
[55:35] like any other child
[55:37] he grew in stature just like any human
[55:40] being
[55:42] as a man he ate and he drank he hungered
[55:45] he thirst
[55:46] he rejoiced in sorrow his body could be
[55:49] touched
[55:50] and handled and wounded and made to
[55:53] bleed
[55:55] he was he was a man of flesh he was
[55:58] certainly no
[55:59] ghost he could be made to bleed he
[56:02] wasn't just a vision
[56:03] he was absolutely flesh and blood
[56:06] like us and that he needed sleep he
[56:09] required
[56:10] rest and food and was subject to pain
[56:14] and who in the end would yield up his
[56:16] life unto death
[56:19] he was born sinless so unlike all of us
[56:23] who were born in this sin
[56:25] shape and iniquity he was the perfect
[56:28] man
[56:29] he was incapable of corruption by sin
[56:33] yet he was made in the likeness of
[56:35] sinful flesh
[56:37] he is man a son of man meaning a man of
[56:40] dust
[56:42] and yet he was the second adam
[56:45] hebrews 2 and 14 says for as much then
[56:48] as the children
[56:49] are partakers of flesh and blood
[56:52] he himself also himself likewise took on
[56:55] part of the same
[56:57] that through death he might destroy him
[56:59] that had the power of death
[57:01] that is the devil you can see what he
[57:04] was doing
[57:05] he would come flash for that purpose to
[57:08] destroy
[57:09] and break the yoke of sin and satan off
[57:11] of our lives
[57:13] you see though through the fall by being
[57:15] birthed in the sand and dust
[57:17] into mortality we were born and we
[57:21] needed redemption from the cradle
[57:24] our human birth birthed us into sin
[57:28] into sickness disease and failure
[57:32] in the message oneness brother branham
[57:34] would say when
[57:35] adam and eve um listen to the lie of the
[57:39] devil the holy image of god
[57:42] left them and their fellowship was
[57:45] broken
[57:46] and their fellowship of oneness with god
[57:48] was broken the very moment
[57:50] the minute they listened to the lie of
[57:52] the devil they broke their fellowship
[57:54] and the very minute you listen to the
[57:55] lie of the devil
[57:56] it'll break your fellowship and that's
[57:59] the very minute you go out of the
[58:00] presence of god like she did is when you
[58:03] fail to take god's word just as it says
[58:06] now he could not redeem us as god
[58:10] we had fallen from that we had lost
[58:14] our godship come on amen and losing our
[58:18] heavenly qualities but
[58:20] we were instead we were fallen man
[58:23] and so god came in the likeness of human
[58:27] flesh
[58:28] he was born of a woman wrapping himself
[58:31] in soil that was cursed you remember
[58:34] god had said i cursed the ground for
[58:37] adam's sake
[58:38] so he would actually wrap himself in
[58:41] cursed earth
[58:43] amen making that curse earth that earth
[58:46] that was cursed
[58:48] obedient to god himself and take it to
[58:51] the river jordan to be baptized
[58:54] and to be filled with the spirit of god
[58:56] the first time
[58:58] since all of time that a man could
[59:00] totally
[59:01] and completely yield every member of his
[59:04] body to god
[59:06] was that was in jesus think of that
[59:09] here he took on the form of man to be
[59:12] kinfolk
[59:13] to be our redeemer yet he is the blessed
[59:18] and only potentate the king of kings and
[59:20] lord of lords
[59:22] in so much he was god though also a man
[59:25] according to the hebrew law he was a
[59:28] goel
[59:30] which me means our kinsmen the next of
[59:34] kin
[59:35] and according to the law if a
[59:37] inheritance had been lost
[59:40] it was the right of the next of kin to
[59:43] redeem it
[59:44] and our lord jesus exercised his legal
[59:48] rights and this is what you're seeing
[59:49] him do
[59:50] in revelation 5. he is actually
[59:52] exercising
[59:54] his legal rights as a kinsman
[59:58] and seeing us sold in the bondage and
[1:00:01] our inheritance taken away from us
[1:00:04] he came forward to redeem both us
[1:00:07] and our lost estate
[1:00:10] i want you to understand that at calvary
[1:00:13] he redeemed us but we're seeing him in
[1:00:17] revelation
[1:00:18] 5 claiming the lost estate
[1:00:22] that man had lost to restore it back to
[1:00:26] man
[1:00:26] again so we are here in the very moment
[1:00:30] in time when god is doing
[1:00:32] something very spectacular and that is
[1:00:35] he is restoring
[1:00:36] the lost estate that adam lost
[1:00:40] back to man again and he showed it here
[1:00:44] as he
[1:00:45] as a man is taking the book he does not
[1:00:49] take it as almighty god
[1:00:50] but he takes it as a man amen
[1:00:54] only a man could do this someone of
[1:00:57] flesh and blood
[1:00:59] as we were amen managed sin
[1:01:02] and man not god not god
[1:01:06] just a man could make reparations for
[1:01:08] those sins
[1:01:10] and the breach of law was caused by man
[1:01:13] and it must be repaired man had
[1:01:16] transgressed
[1:01:17] and man must be punished
[1:01:21] no angel could have said i will take
[1:01:23] this man
[1:01:24] separately i will take mankind's
[1:01:26] punishment
[1:01:27] angelic sufferings could not make amends
[1:01:30] for human sins
[1:01:32] amen god could not do it this is one
[1:01:35] thing that
[1:01:36] god could not do he could not make
[1:01:38] amends
[1:01:40] for human sins amen he could not do it
[1:01:44] as almighty god
[1:01:46] it would require a kin kinsman
[1:01:49] someone can vote so in order for god to
[1:01:52] do this
[1:01:53] god would take on human flesh he would
[1:01:56] strip out of heaven
[1:01:57] he would leave the holy throne he would
[1:02:00] walk out of his majestic garments and
[1:02:03] lay them aside
[1:02:04] and walk down a long sinful man
[1:02:08] for the purpose to be your kinsmen
[1:02:13] god becoming kinfolk to you being born
[1:02:17] uh in the flesh like you're born into
[1:02:20] flesh
[1:02:24] so he could rebirth you
[1:02:27] from human back to god again
[1:02:31] [Music]
[1:02:33] god left his throne to be born a man
[1:02:37] and that man jesus none other was none
[1:02:39] other than jehovah himself
[1:02:42] coming to be our savior the matchless
[1:02:45] one
[1:02:46] this the sinless man the representative
[1:02:50] a man of right by ken folks
[1:02:54] only he could be allowed to redeem he
[1:02:57] stepped in and he
[1:02:58] and he suffered that that which was due
[1:03:00] and he made amends
[1:03:02] for man and thereby he set us free
[1:03:06] i want you to understand it was god's
[1:03:08] design
[1:03:09] and god's great plan because he knew
[1:03:13] the heart of man and he knew that man
[1:03:16] would fall
[1:03:17] he knew he could place him upon freemore
[1:03:19] agents and he would choose the wrong
[1:03:21] thing
[1:03:22] anyhow but before before sin ever
[1:03:26] entered the picture
[1:03:27] he already was the redeemer for he was
[1:03:30] that great lamb
[1:03:31] that was slain before the foundation of
[1:03:34] the world
[1:03:35] in the mind of god he had planned it
[1:03:38] before the fall ever took place
[1:03:40] knowing that you would fall he already
[1:03:43] had provided the way back
[1:03:45] and he said i am the lamb slain before
[1:03:48] the foundation of the world
[1:03:50] and in god's great mind he stepped out
[1:03:53] of eternity there
[1:03:54] and played out what he had in his mind
[1:03:58] in flesh
[1:04:01] oh this is wonderful it is the man
[1:04:05] that we see oh it is veiled symbolically
[1:04:09] as a lamb but it is only representing
[1:04:12] the work of the redeemer as the
[1:04:15] sacrifice
[1:04:17] and it shows him as a man advocating for
[1:04:21] you
[1:04:22] amen you know again to take and into
[1:04:25] lucid seals
[1:04:26] he would have to be the advocate for all
[1:04:28] mankind
[1:04:30] he would have to be the go-between
[1:04:32] between god
[1:04:33] and man because there was
[1:04:36] no man worthy and able to take the book
[1:04:40] and restore back the title
[1:04:43] of man's loss to state
[1:04:47] think of this as we as we
[1:04:51] look upon him this morning look upon
[1:04:53] this scene
[1:04:54] we see a man going forth to take the
[1:04:57] book
[1:04:59] and to lose his seals oh if you're
[1:05:02] even a sinner today and far from god
[1:05:06] i think it's wondrous that your approach
[1:05:08] to god
[1:05:09] is through the man christ jesus for he
[1:05:12] would say himself
[1:05:13] no one can come unto god to the father
[1:05:15] except by me
[1:05:17] that he would be the means of the
[1:05:19] approach back to god
[1:05:21] that he himself when man lost the way
[1:05:24] would become the way
[1:05:26] in order to approach god again and to
[1:05:28] come back into fellowship again
[1:05:31] and you are not being called to come
[1:05:33] near a consuming fire that would wipe
[1:05:36] you out in an instance
[1:05:38] you are not summoned to to try and
[1:05:41] appease an angry god
[1:05:43] who has been so grievously offended
[1:05:46] but there is a man ordained
[1:05:50] amen who is the only mediator
[1:05:53] between god and man and if you want to
[1:05:56] come to god you must come
[1:05:58] through him the man christ jesus
[1:06:02] satan has done everything that he can to
[1:06:05] discredit
[1:06:06] this man to take away his advocacy
[1:06:10] to reject him his intercessor to say
[1:06:13] he no longer intercedes but the very act
[1:06:17] of him taking the
[1:06:18] book of redemption is a part of his
[1:06:20] intercessory work
[1:06:22] and it shows him as the great
[1:06:24] intercessor
[1:06:25] between god and man when man couldn't go
[1:06:29] get the book and could not regain his
[1:06:32] lost estate
[1:06:33] god came a man in order to pay the price
[1:06:36] of redemption
[1:06:41] to probe to approach god without christ
[1:06:44] would be certain death and rejection
[1:06:47] i want to say this even today no man
[1:06:50] dare to approach god
[1:06:52] without christ
[1:06:59] for god he will by no means spare the
[1:07:02] guilty
[1:07:04] but oh isn't it wonderful that we can
[1:07:06] look
[1:07:07] and see the son of man one of our own
[1:07:10] race
[1:07:11] who became the lamb for the sins of man
[1:07:15] to pay the penalty of sin
[1:07:20] this one who is our king the lion of the
[1:07:22] tribe of judah
[1:07:24] who threw off his his kingly robe and
[1:07:27] laid aside his crown and walked among us
[1:07:31] as our kinsmen
[1:07:34] when we look and we see and we get a
[1:07:36] view of him give me a little more sound
[1:07:38] of here
[1:07:39] and you get a you get a view of him
[1:07:42] here in his earthly walk
[1:07:45] and how what his attitude was toward the
[1:07:48] sick
[1:07:49] what his attitude was to the lost
[1:07:53] amen what moved him he would constantly
[1:07:57] be moved to compel with compassion
[1:08:00] are you with me amen it was
[1:08:03] it was no transient feeling he still
[1:08:06] feels toward his offspring the same way
[1:08:09] you can depend on it church
[1:08:12] a man that you're coming to a
[1:08:14] compassionate god
[1:08:16] a compassionate one who cares
[1:08:19] who sincerely cares about the suffering
[1:08:23] that you're going through or your lost
[1:08:25] sinful estate
[1:08:27] some of you are going around as it was
[1:08:30] through the air and over heels over
[1:08:33] heels
[1:08:33] over heels going there in a bottomless
[1:08:37] fall and there is none that can help you
[1:08:40] i cannot help you a church cannot help
[1:08:43] you
[1:08:44] hey man your mama and your dad cannot
[1:08:46] help you
[1:08:47] your nearest friends cannot help you the
[1:08:50] only one that can break that
[1:08:51] fall is him who can reach out of
[1:08:54] compassion at hand and break the fall
[1:08:58] of any sinner and put him on solid
[1:09:02] ground
[1:09:04] the compassion of jesus no is not
[1:09:08] a changeable feeling it's not transient
[1:09:11] he still feels toward us the same as it
[1:09:14] was when he walked
[1:09:16] and he looked upon the blind staggering
[1:09:18] in darkness
[1:09:19] and he looked upon blind men who were
[1:09:23] were with compassion and he and were
[1:09:26] asking for mercy
[1:09:28] and he touched their eyes and they could
[1:09:30] see
[1:09:31] he looked upon a leper who said lord if
[1:09:34] thou will
[1:09:36] make me clean and he said i will
[1:09:40] be thou clean it's the hope for
[1:09:43] every leprous sinner who is unclean who
[1:09:47] who goes about the world with their
[1:09:50] mouth and face covered
[1:09:51] and screaming out i'm unclean i'm
[1:09:53] unclean
[1:09:54] oh they may not do that naturally maybe
[1:09:57] their hearty
[1:09:58] and think of their themself as great but
[1:10:01] their life
[1:10:02] is absolutely ringing out i'm unclean
[1:10:05] i'm unclean i'm unclean and they get
[1:10:08] among the clean and they feel
[1:10:10] so unclean and they feel a sense of
[1:10:13] rejection and distance
[1:10:16] somehow i just don't fit in somehow i'm
[1:10:19] just not accepted
[1:10:20] somehow because they're leprous
[1:10:25] with sin and their soul is screaming out
[1:10:29] i'm unclean
[1:10:31] i'm unclean i'm unclean
[1:10:35] amen but oh he looked upon a leper who
[1:10:39] come to him and said
[1:10:41] oh if thou will make me clean
[1:10:46] and he quickly affirmed that was his
[1:10:48] will
[1:10:50] to make the leper clean he looked upon
[1:10:53] the multitude who was
[1:10:56] and was concerned that they would fade
[1:10:58] upon the way
[1:11:00] and up on the road as they departed and
[1:11:02] he took fishes
[1:11:04] and loaves and fed 5 000
[1:11:07] because his compassion moved him
[1:11:12] it was said of the of the greek soldiers
[1:11:16] i think they were macedonians soldiers
[1:11:19] who were
[1:11:20] led by alexander the great
[1:11:23] these men would march with forced
[1:11:26] marches
[1:11:26] and and and they they they seemed to do
[1:11:30] it with
[1:11:31] without fatigue would move and go here
[1:11:34] and go there
[1:11:35] and go here and go there at the at the
[1:11:37] whim of their
[1:11:38] of their leader alexander the great
[1:11:42] and they seem to go beyond the power
[1:11:45] of mortal endurance
[1:11:49] but the reason of their untiring energy
[1:11:53] lay in the fact of alexander's presence
[1:11:59] you see alexander though he was a king
[1:12:03] he would walk with him
[1:12:06] he would bear the same fatigue they went
[1:12:09] through
[1:12:10] he was unlike the persian monarchs who
[1:12:13] would be carried on a pier
[1:12:15] and and um and and they're
[1:12:18] on a luxurious litter on their shoulders
[1:12:22] and be fed wine and
[1:12:25] and choice foods as the men struggled
[1:12:29] but alexander the great the king
[1:12:32] their king marched with them he hungered
[1:12:36] like they hungered he thirsted like
[1:12:39] they thirsted it was said of him he
[1:12:42] would often put aside
[1:12:44] the cup of water that was offered to him
[1:12:46] and pass it to a fellow soldier that
[1:12:48] looked more weary than himself
[1:12:51] they would they wouldn't dream of
[1:12:53] slacking for their king
[1:12:56] walked among them their king was with
[1:12:59] them
[1:13:00] it wasn't him just saying go do this and
[1:13:03] go do this but he was walking with them
[1:13:07] and i want to just say today we can
[1:13:09] surely bear the poverty
[1:13:11] the slander the contempt or even the
[1:13:14] bodily pain
[1:13:15] because jesus christ our lord has done
[1:13:19] it all for us
[1:13:20] by his humiliation we can count it all
[1:13:23] joy
[1:13:24] that we are looked down upon the world
[1:13:26] for his name's sake
[1:13:28] amen by the spindle that ran down
[1:13:31] his cheek it is something a virtue
[1:13:35] amen to be a mockery now for him
[1:13:39] by the buffeting and the blindfolding in
[1:13:41] the judgment hall
[1:13:42] it's an honor to stand with him
[1:13:45] disgraced
[1:13:47] while world takes and scourges him and
[1:13:51] mocks him
[1:13:51] and crucifies him we stand with him
[1:13:56] isaiah said and a man
[1:13:59] shall be a hiding place from the wind
[1:14:03] and a covert from the tempest
[1:14:06] this is isaiah 32 and 2 a man
[1:14:09] a man shall be a hiding place
[1:14:13] i want you to know this land that we're
[1:14:15] looking at
[1:14:16] is our hiding place he is our covert our
[1:14:20] shelter from the tempest
[1:14:22] he is our rock in a weary land and our
[1:14:25] shelter in the time of storm
[1:14:27] he is our kinsman and we can
[1:14:31] shelter in his love and passion
[1:14:35] notice it was 2 000 years ago
[1:14:39] that he paid for our sins and he sent
[1:14:42] back a deposit
[1:14:44] of the holy ghost which is the earnest
[1:14:48] of our inheritance
[1:14:50] you know what time would fail us if we
[1:14:52] talked about
[1:14:53] why the lamb was slain how the lamb was
[1:14:56] slain
[1:14:57] there have been we're we're familiar
[1:15:00] with that story we
[1:15:02] we many of you have seen even movies of
[1:15:05] the passion of christ
[1:15:06] or you you've seen scenes have been
[1:15:10] mocked you read it in the scripture
[1:15:12] it's always a very difficult place for
[1:15:15] me when i read my bible and
[1:15:17] go through the scriptures to have to go
[1:15:20] through that part
[1:15:21] as i think of a man so kind
[1:15:24] so wonderful so compassionate
[1:15:27] so moved by the holy spirit
[1:15:31] that he couldn't leave a blind eye
[1:15:34] unopened
[1:15:35] he couldn't leave a lame with a on his
[1:15:38] crutches but made him walk
[1:15:40] he couldn't pass up a funeral possession
[1:15:44] without restoring a young boy back to
[1:15:46] his mother
[1:15:49] and how could it be that he would be
[1:15:51] mocked and made fun of oh
[1:15:53] yes a robber a criminal someone
[1:15:56] deserving yes
[1:15:58] but how this
[1:16:02] but now we look at a different scene
[1:16:06] we look at a scene that is not preached
[1:16:08] on
[1:16:09] by the world that will be hardly
[1:16:13] referenced anywhere in denominational
[1:16:15] pulpits
[1:16:17] yeah today that will preach about christ
[1:16:19] and his sufferings on the cross
[1:16:22] but there's very little being preached
[1:16:26] aware that he stood in the breach for us
[1:16:28] to take
[1:16:29] our inheritance back for us
[1:16:35] and we read what happened two thousand
[1:16:38] years ago and yes
[1:16:40] there are those that are preaching and
[1:16:42] declaring and
[1:16:43] and and and and sharing today
[1:16:46] uh the the wondrous experience of the
[1:16:48] upper room and
[1:16:50] how he came down like tongues of fire
[1:16:52] and and i'll spread out there from there
[1:16:54] the gospel
[1:16:57] but now we're here seven church ages
[1:16:59] later
[1:17:01] and heaven is moving again
[1:17:05] as by revelation the lamb takes the book
[1:17:08] of our inheritance and he loses
[1:17:11] the seals
[1:17:15] it was at calvary we were redeemed
[1:17:18] but now the lamb moves in heaven it's
[1:17:21] not
[1:17:22] to pay for the price of our sins
[1:17:26] for our soul salvation that was david
[1:17:29] calvary
[1:17:31] he paid and died once and for all
[1:17:34] he need not die again and again and
[1:17:37] offer himself
[1:17:38] as a sacrifice over and over and over
[1:17:42] his one death was sufficient for all
[1:17:46] but now again here we're looking at
[1:17:50] now seven church ages later
[1:17:54] heaven moves as by revelation
[1:17:58] now remember it's always first by
[1:18:00] revelation first it was in symbol john
[1:18:03] saw it
[1:18:03] then it would be by revelation to a
[1:18:06] prophet and then it will finally be been
[1:18:08] manifested in a literal format
[1:18:14] now as we as we see this the lamb
[1:18:18] takes the book of our inheritance
[1:18:21] and loses the seals
[1:18:25] we were redeemed at calvary but now
[1:18:29] here we see the lamb continuing
[1:18:32] in his intercessory work
[1:18:37] now you say oh brother jim it all
[1:18:39] stopped when he took the book it did not
[1:18:41] because
[1:18:42] he continues right on with the jews
[1:18:46] in in the in the book of revelation he
[1:18:48] is the lamb
[1:18:50] they're among the 144 thousands
[1:18:56] amen all redemption may come
[1:18:59] and does come to a point where it's over
[1:19:01] for the gentiles
[1:19:02] but it continues right on with the lamb
[1:19:05] among the 144
[1:19:07] 000 and his redemption work as he fills
[1:19:11] them with the holy spirit
[1:19:13] and they are sealed but i want you
[1:19:16] to look at this but to take this book
[1:19:20] of our lost estate to redeem back to man
[1:19:22] everything
[1:19:23] adam lost it was not accomplished at
[1:19:26] calvary
[1:19:27] it was just the it was just started
[1:19:30] the process
[1:19:34] and this act of the taking of the book
[1:19:36] of title to our lost estate
[1:19:38] brother branham would say it is the most
[1:19:40] sublime
[1:19:42] the most awesome majestic most
[1:19:46] glorious rapturous act
[1:19:49] in all the scripture
[1:19:52] i don't know what you look at when you
[1:19:54] look at revelation 5 but this is
[1:19:56] this is what brother branham how he
[1:19:58] viewed it he said it's the most sublime
[1:20:01] act it's the most majestic
[1:20:04] glorious rapturous awesome
[1:20:08] act in all the scripture
[1:20:12] amen to do it the lamb had to take the
[1:20:16] book
[1:20:17] a title from the one on the throne
[1:20:20] and since it is closed and sealed remove
[1:20:24] its seals
[1:20:26] and to do that he must take his blood
[1:20:29] because the debts can only be paid for
[1:20:31] by lamb's blood and he must erase
[1:20:35] the depths of sin that has kept the book
[1:20:38] of inheritance closed to man
[1:20:43] the same blood to cleanse your soul
[1:20:48] must now cleanse the deaths
[1:20:52] on the book
[1:20:56] now where are we standing
[1:21:00] where has god positioned us in this time
[1:21:04] what is the blood done for us when a
[1:21:06] bloody lamb
[1:21:07] steps forth to take the book and lose
[1:21:09] its seals
[1:21:10] and confers the title to the earth upon
[1:21:14] us because i want you to understand
[1:21:17] that we we are in a time where we stand
[1:21:21] exactly like they did in the book of
[1:21:24] acts
[1:21:26] when they received the cleared deed
[1:21:30] are you with me amen when their deed was
[1:21:33] cleared
[1:21:33] and there on the day of pentecost they
[1:21:36] went out
[1:21:37] speaking in all languages
[1:21:40] the wondrous works of god they would be
[1:21:43] heard in all nations under heaven
[1:21:47] and we come again to the last days
[1:21:50] where the bible prophesies this happens
[1:21:53] again
[1:21:54] for in revelation 10 7 again we see
[1:21:58] christ the mighty angel coming down
[1:22:01] putting his land his foot upon the land
[1:22:04] and on the sea
[1:22:05] and there when he cries when he shouts
[1:22:09] when he begins this process amen
[1:22:12] a prophet sounds and he begins to sound
[1:22:15] his message
[1:22:16] and the seven thunders of revelation 10
[1:22:19] are revealed
[1:22:22] which are the mysteries contained in the
[1:22:24] seven seals
[1:22:26] amen because what you're seeing is in
[1:22:28] the invisible realm
[1:22:30] there's something that has happened that
[1:22:32] is beyond
[1:22:33] the naked eye but revelation 5 catches a
[1:22:36] glimpse of it
[1:22:37] and revelation 10 also he also emboldens
[1:22:41] that glimpse or enhances that glimpse
[1:22:44] where we can see the same book that
[1:22:46] could not be looked upon
[1:22:47] is now looked upon those that was once
[1:22:50] considered
[1:22:51] unworthy to look upon it
[1:22:56] and we see again uh the mighty angel
[1:23:00] coming down just as the day of pentecost
[1:23:03] the mighty angel
[1:23:04] the pillar of fire comes down and he
[1:23:07] separates his self
[1:23:09] and now he comes upon every individual
[1:23:11] he begins to anoint men
[1:23:13] and women and they begin to proclaim the
[1:23:16] wondrous words of god in every language
[1:23:20] and then we see in revelation 10 the
[1:23:23] mighty angel coming down
[1:23:25] if i can use brother branham's words for
[1:23:28] it
[1:23:28] he would say it like this he said and
[1:23:31] when he took
[1:23:32] and he opened the seals he handed him
[1:23:35] down to the seventh angel on earth
[1:23:40] i want you to notice it did not it did
[1:23:43] not
[1:23:45] it did not stay in the heavens but the
[1:23:48] receipt of that
[1:23:50] the receipt of the paid debts would
[1:23:53] send down what the white horse had done
[1:23:56] the red horse the black the pale the
[1:23:58] things that
[1:23:58] had sealed the book to from the people
[1:24:01] and kept our inheritance closed
[1:24:03] where we could not even read it if you
[1:24:06] notice in the bible
[1:24:08] no man could look or read it amen but i
[1:24:11] want you to know
[1:24:12] you are men and women today who are able
[1:24:15] to look and
[1:24:16] read it you read it and you know who the
[1:24:19] white horse is
[1:24:20] you read it and you know who the pale
[1:24:22] horse is you
[1:24:23] read it and you know the souls under the
[1:24:25] altar you read it and you know what the
[1:24:27] seventh seal is
[1:24:29] that god has broke the silence and it's
[1:24:32] initiated his coming in this last day
[1:24:41] and as he does the prayers the prayers
[1:24:44] that have been stored up
[1:24:45] that is seen in revelation 5 that
[1:24:49] that the elders were representative of
[1:24:51] all of the
[1:24:52] of the saints of all ages that the
[1:24:55] elders are holding in their
[1:24:57] there the the the prayers of the saints
[1:25:01] and in revelation in the seventh seal
[1:25:04] they're poured out
[1:25:08] because why prayers that have been held
[1:25:10] up
[1:25:12] for his coming
[1:25:16] he's had to put him on the back burner i
[1:25:18] can't do it yet
[1:25:20] in this first stage there's six more to
[1:25:22] come
[1:25:24] i can't do it in the in in in the second
[1:25:27] age
[1:25:28] there's five more to come
[1:25:31] if i would answer these prayers now
[1:25:34] there'd be many in the book
[1:25:36] that wouldn't be redeemed and they're in
[1:25:40] my mind they were part of me
[1:25:43] and i cannot stop it i must continue
[1:25:47] redemption but when it becomes time
[1:25:51] the prayers are poured out upon the
[1:25:54] altar
[1:25:54] and mixed with the incense and comes up
[1:25:56] before god and god begins to respond
[1:25:59] with thunderings on the earth as a
[1:26:02] prophet begins to
[1:26:03] interpret the symbols of the seals
[1:26:07] by revelation handed down
[1:26:10] from the and brought down by the mighty
[1:26:12] angel
[1:26:15] now but that's not all of it
[1:26:20] but then there is a people
[1:26:23] that is commanded to take the book
[1:26:27] not loose it seals it's open
[1:26:31] but to eat the book and to become one
[1:26:34] with that book
[1:26:36] and when they come one speak
[1:26:41] prophesy again just like they prophesied
[1:26:46] in the book of acts hallelujah
[1:26:50] i want you to see something that the
[1:26:52] prophecy
[1:26:53] of the book of acts it was put on hold
[1:26:56] for seven ages
[1:26:57] but it continues in the last day
[1:27:01] under the anointing of the mighty angel
[1:27:04] and there are
[1:27:05] people in this last day who are anointed
[1:27:08] to become one with that word and
[1:27:11] prophesy it to
[1:27:12] ever nation kindred tongue and tribe and
[1:27:16] people
[1:27:20] where are we standing where has god
[1:27:23] positioned us now
[1:27:25] what is the blood done for us when a
[1:27:27] bloody lamb
[1:27:28] stepped forth to take the book and lose
[1:27:30] its seals and then
[1:27:32] begins to confer the title
[1:27:36] the title to the earth upon us
[1:27:40] amen i want you to get it just a moment
[1:27:44] because not on in this book of course
[1:27:48] is the the understanding the revelation
[1:27:51] as as he writes out his will
[1:27:55] for the people in the title to my
[1:27:57] beloved children
[1:28:01] you are not you have not just
[1:28:05] come into existence in this last day
[1:28:09] but know you existed with me before the
[1:28:12] foundation of the world
[1:28:15] and i'm addressing you as not as a
[1:28:18] temporary people
[1:28:20] but a people of eternal who have that to
[1:28:23] this
[1:28:23] elect has an eternal quality
[1:28:27] that you have been chosen in me before
[1:28:29] the world began
[1:28:31] and he begins to write it out and tell
[1:28:34] you what your name is and what the
[1:28:36] family name is
[1:28:38] and that it's not under father son and
[1:28:40] holy ghost
[1:28:41] but it's the lord jesus christ of whom
[1:28:44] all heaven and earth is named and it
[1:28:47] begins to reveal
[1:28:49] and show see hears what happened at the
[1:28:52] beginning
[1:28:53] and he shows you the old serpent the
[1:28:55] villain from the beginning
[1:28:56] and how he deceived and the deception
[1:28:59] that has happened the deception in the
[1:29:00] first age
[1:29:01] and on and on and on down but yet where
[1:29:04] god
[1:29:04] brings it back the entire circle again
[1:29:08] and we're living in a time where we're
[1:29:10] not walking out of eden
[1:29:12] but we're a people who are walking back
[1:29:14] into eden
[1:29:16] [Applause]
[1:29:21] this brings us back to where adam was
[1:29:23] before the fall
[1:29:25] and to where the church was in those
[1:29:29] brief moments
[1:29:32] in the book of acts
[1:29:35] what happened in the beginning in
[1:29:36] genesis
[1:29:38] it started out without him having power
[1:29:41] trans
[1:29:42] of creation as a manifested messiah
[1:29:47] what was the church in the book of acts
[1:29:49] when their deed was cleared they
[1:29:50] controlled nature
[1:29:52] they healed the sick that made the lame
[1:29:53] walk
[1:29:55] and man they they they exposed sin they
[1:29:58] were so close
[1:30:00] to the chase from mortal
[1:30:03] to immortality till it began to be the
[1:30:08] mystery being revealed
[1:30:10] that there's a mystery in here and
[1:30:12] beloved i
[1:30:13] show you a mystery
[1:30:17] it's got to end up the same way as we
[1:30:19] close out the ages
[1:30:21] with manifested messiahs who are the
[1:30:25] sons of god
[1:30:26] on display this is exactly what is shown
[1:30:30] in revelation 10
[1:30:32] sons and daughters of god on display
[1:30:36] it cannot be manifested sons unless
[1:30:38] they're revealed sons
[1:30:41] sons who are showing and manifesting
[1:30:44] what what who they are and their sonship
[1:30:48] has got to end up the same way this is
[1:30:52] this is what brother branham would say
[1:30:54] over and over and over again about
[1:30:56] displaying the token the token must be
[1:30:59] on just play
[1:31:00] amen and just play and it changes your
[1:31:03] life it makes you live right
[1:31:04] it talks right but it also heals and
[1:31:06] delivers and sets free
[1:31:08] it's the token on display and brother
[1:31:11] branham would tell us
[1:31:12] in order to escape the death angel that
[1:31:14] is coming it must be
[1:31:16] on display
[1:31:21] look back at the beginning adam stood as
[1:31:24] the son of god
[1:31:26] he controlled nature but when sin under
[1:31:29] the picture
[1:31:30] it put a breach a chasm between god and
[1:31:34] man
[1:31:35] and mankind has went on a long journey
[1:31:39] all the way from eden he went on a long
[1:31:43] journey until finally
[1:31:44] the promised seed came the one we're
[1:31:48] talking about the woman's seed who would
[1:31:50] bruise the head of the serpent
[1:31:54] and until and we'd go
[1:31:57] on this long journey with a chasm
[1:31:59] between man and god
[1:32:01] until the second adam came that would
[1:32:03] undo what sin
[1:32:05] had done in eden
[1:32:08] adam was a miniature creator adam had
[1:32:11] dominion over the fish of the sea
[1:32:14] the fowl of the air he was in fellowship
[1:32:16] with god
[1:32:18] amen he had direct asset access
[1:32:22] to the throne room he created an
[1:32:25] atmosphere of a millennium everywhere
[1:32:28] that he was
[1:32:29] or everywhere he went up on the earth
[1:32:31] the birds
[1:32:32] the mammals the crocodiles were all
[1:32:35] subject to him
[1:32:37] amen nothing would hurt or destroy
[1:32:40] in all of god's holy eden before the
[1:32:42] fall
[1:32:44] adam was in a position of sonship
[1:32:47] as a son of god and he operated by
[1:32:50] faith with the power and authority of
[1:32:54] heaven behind him and he spoke
[1:32:57] and trees moved he commanded
[1:33:01] and winds obeyed he exercised his rights
[1:33:05] over animals and called them by name
[1:33:09] when man sinned he forfeited his sonship
[1:33:12] to become a slave
[1:33:14] and instead of now becoming lord over
[1:33:18] creation he becomes a slave to the very
[1:33:20] creation
[1:33:21] that he once controlled the winds the
[1:33:24] waves the
[1:33:25] the the tumultuous seas the problem
[1:33:28] nothing now was under his command
[1:33:31] he he would lose power he would become
[1:33:34] subject
[1:33:36] to to adversity he would have to fear
[1:33:39] the wild
[1:33:39] animals you know he he would
[1:33:43] he would now instead of ruling by
[1:33:46] faith in god's word he would have to
[1:33:49] rule
[1:33:50] by his five senses using the five
[1:33:54] uh the five outlets of this of his
[1:33:56] spirit of memory and imagination and
[1:33:58] conscience and affection
[1:34:00] and reasoning with his superior mind he
[1:34:03] could capture animals
[1:34:06] and subdue them he could harness the
[1:34:08] energy of a horse
[1:34:10] for his own prophet he could enslave
[1:34:13] an animal for its wool and its meat and
[1:34:15] its milk
[1:34:17] then before the fall adam could walk
[1:34:20] freely into god's presence
[1:34:22] and he would literally bring heaven down
[1:34:26] a millennium condition was upon the
[1:34:28] earth
[1:34:29] but after the fall there was this
[1:34:31] distance between
[1:34:32] god and man and this distance was like a
[1:34:36] huge deep wide chasm
[1:34:40] so deep you could never climb over it
[1:34:43] so wide you couldn't see across it
[1:34:46] and managed sin and put that great chasm
[1:34:49] between him and god
[1:34:50] and oh and it was a chasm that he could
[1:34:53] not cross over
[1:34:55] by himself he was absolutely totally
[1:34:58] lost and without a way back
[1:35:03] and when man couldn't come to god god
[1:35:06] being determined to save man
[1:35:09] he himself breeds the chasm
[1:35:12] and he came in the likeness of human
[1:35:14] flesh
[1:35:15] and through his blood he made a way for
[1:35:17] those who were born in sin
[1:35:19] to be born again every one of us
[1:35:23] were born wrong the first time therefore
[1:35:27] we had to be born again
[1:35:31] amen it would be the second birth that
[1:35:33] would
[1:35:34] that would breed out all the call
[1:35:38] amen no matter what our mother did or
[1:35:40] daddy did it or grandparents did it or
[1:35:42] whatever
[1:35:42] it would breed it all out hallelujah
[1:35:46] we'd get a whole new set of genealogy we
[1:35:49] we would be a part of a whole new race
[1:35:51] it would not be another man's race but
[1:35:54] it would be the god race
[1:35:57] are you with me amen there at pentecost
[1:36:01] man and god were reconciled amen they
[1:36:04] had the contents of the book
[1:36:07] brother branham would tell us there it
[1:36:09] was actually at the river jordan that he
[1:36:11] would
[1:36:11] he would specifically say when jesus
[1:36:14] walked out into the river
[1:36:16] bringing that cursed flesh obedient to
[1:36:18] the word of god
[1:36:20] and making it obey god he would say from
[1:36:23] this part
[1:36:24] i will redeem this part and from this
[1:36:27] part
[1:36:28] i will redeem the rest
[1:36:32] now then here he would here
[1:36:35] heaven and earth would be reconciled
[1:36:38] because god and man would not be united
[1:36:42] together
[1:36:43] in the man christ jesus
[1:36:48] but he wasn't happy just to have that
[1:36:51] for himself
[1:36:53] he wanted many sons he had
[1:36:56] you in mind you wonder how did he bear
[1:37:00] the cross of calvary let me tell you
[1:37:02] friends you know
[1:37:04] he didn't just have imaginations at
[1:37:06] calvary
[1:37:07] he acts are at gethsemane he actually
[1:37:11] knew what was going to happen he knew
[1:37:14] what he would suffer
[1:37:15] he renewed the rejection that's being
[1:37:18] spit upon
[1:37:20] he would know he would know the
[1:37:22] crucifixion
[1:37:23] and the pain thereof
[1:37:26] and he would shudder at his thoughts
[1:37:30] and as even as a human he would say
[1:37:35] let it pass from me
[1:37:41] but he yielded up his own human desires
[1:37:43] to desire of god and say
[1:37:46] nevertheless
[1:37:48] not my will but thou have be done
[1:37:52] that song says he knew me yet he loved
[1:37:55] me
[1:37:56] [Music]
[1:37:57] he whose glory makes the heavens to
[1:38:00] shine
[1:38:01] so unworthy of such mercy
[1:38:04] but when he was on the cross we were on
[1:38:08] his mind
[1:38:11] the bible said that looking toward
[1:38:14] the the goal to what he would receive
[1:38:19] he bore the shame he experienced the
[1:38:22] agony
[1:38:23] in order that he could have a family
[1:38:27] that he could be kinfolk to you and pay
[1:38:31] that price of redemption
[1:38:33] and bear the debt that he did not owe
[1:38:36] and pay it on your behalf
[1:38:43] very at pentecost we see this
[1:38:46] oneness continuing here not not not just
[1:38:50] jesus the sinless one and god
[1:38:54] reconciled in a man but now
[1:38:57] now then at pentecost man and god
[1:39:01] was reconciled here they were
[1:39:04] enjoying the contents or the fruits
[1:39:08] of the book they had power of
[1:39:11] sonship as sons of the book
[1:39:16] amen oh think of this we we're we're
[1:39:19] preaching about
[1:39:20] the people of the book this is what
[1:39:22] we're talking about
[1:39:24] we're people of this book this is our
[1:39:28] inheritance
[1:39:29] this is our promise this is the land
[1:39:32] that he has
[1:39:33] brought a people to where we stand today
[1:39:36] on the other side of jordan
[1:39:40] are you with me into the third pull of
[1:39:42] the holy ghost into the power of the
[1:39:44] promise
[1:39:47] they had power as sons of the book would
[1:39:50] you stop and realize what we are
[1:39:52] in time look where we're standing on the
[1:39:56] threshold of redemption
[1:39:58] for thousands of years the book of
[1:40:02] titles that adam lost has remained in
[1:40:04] the hand of god
[1:40:07] but in this day hallelujah
[1:40:10] there's been a change as a man
[1:40:14] who is declared worthy
[1:40:17] amen to take the book out of the hand of
[1:40:20] him that sat on the throne
[1:40:22] notice he had to drink it back but the
[1:40:24] book was closed and sealed with seven
[1:40:26] seals
[1:40:28] there was a preach that he put the
[1:40:31] church ages out of reach of the book of
[1:40:34] title until we come to the last days
[1:40:37] and then the worthy lamb the man christ
[1:40:40] jesus
[1:40:41] stands in the gap notice he stands
[1:40:46] to take the book this is exactly
[1:40:49] reminiscent of
[1:40:51] daniel chapter 12 1 and michael
[1:40:54] stood for the children of his people
[1:40:59] i want you to know when the bible said
[1:41:01] when this happened
[1:41:02] that the name those whose names was in
[1:41:05] the book
[1:41:05] was delivered they were delivered and
[1:41:10] there was a resurrection
[1:41:12] this is the hour that we're living in
[1:41:14] where that a
[1:41:15] people whose names are in the book will
[1:41:18] be delivered
[1:41:20] and a resurrection of all the names
[1:41:23] of all the saints that has went down
[1:41:26] through pentek from pentecost till now
[1:41:29] will raise again
[1:41:34] the man christ jesus stood in the gap in
[1:41:37] the breach
[1:41:39] that could take and could take the the
[1:41:42] book
[1:41:42] and lose its seals in order to
[1:41:46] restore the book of title to god's
[1:41:50] people
[1:41:51] revelation 5 shows him taking it
[1:41:54] revelation 10 shows him given it
[1:41:59] the truth of god's word that we're close
[1:42:02] to man
[1:42:03] truth such as original sin well
[1:42:07] you know that revelation alone
[1:42:10] explains and makes you to understand the
[1:42:13] virgin
[1:42:14] birth that revelation alone
[1:42:18] makes you to understand the sin and the
[1:42:20] garden and why
[1:42:21] we needed a redeemer amen
[1:42:24] there again baptism in jesus name
[1:42:28] one god predestination they were all
[1:42:30] sealed up
[1:42:32] oh yeah man proved at it they got some
[1:42:35] things right or part right
[1:42:37] but none could cross the chasm
[1:42:41] amen this was not this was not so in the
[1:42:44] days of the early church or in the days
[1:42:46] of peter and paul
[1:42:48] jesus had cleared the deed he had paid
[1:42:51] the dead and full
[1:42:52] he had so cleared so clear was the deed
[1:42:55] that there was not
[1:42:56] one soul left in abraham's bosom
[1:43:00] in that place called paradise the deed
[1:43:02] the deeds of all the old testament
[1:43:05] saints
[1:43:05] were cleared truths that were shut off
[1:43:08] from man
[1:43:10] what revealed is jesus was the
[1:43:12] fulfillment of all the prophecies
[1:43:16] the book was totally open to them with
[1:43:20] its power silver and gold have i none
[1:43:24] but i got something better than silver
[1:43:26] and gold
[1:43:29] miracles happened the sick were laid
[1:43:32] in the shadow of peter wherewith his
[1:43:34] shadow would pass over them
[1:43:36] and demons fled and left at the mere
[1:43:39] presence
[1:43:40] of these sons of god amen i want you to
[1:43:44] know
[1:43:44] they did not just have doctrine
[1:43:49] amen there was power released with that
[1:43:52] doctrine
[1:43:54] you cannot have true doctrine and not
[1:43:56] have the power
[1:43:57] [Applause]
[1:44:02] angels came to prison left their
[1:44:04] disciples free
[1:44:06] paul would get to looking in the book
[1:44:08] and show predestination to true eternal
[1:44:10] security
[1:44:11] peter would point out that the key that
[1:44:14] would unlock
[1:44:15] unlock many things and preach the
[1:44:17] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:44:20] from an open book saying this is that
[1:44:24] no wonder would we have to wonder about
[1:44:26] joel 2
[1:44:28] we would know this is that we were
[1:44:31] spoken of by the
[1:44:32] by the the prophets they would stand on
[1:44:36] the edge of the full promise
[1:44:38] and begin to declare we which are alive
[1:44:40] and remain
[1:44:42] but then as the serpent begot eve now we
[1:44:45] see a replay
[1:44:48] of what happened to the natural man and
[1:44:50] natural eve
[1:44:52] now beginning to happen to spiritual
[1:45:00] event
[1:45:02] it wasn't long
[1:45:06] oh this is a heartbreak to today
[1:45:11] it wasn't long until the devil got in
[1:45:13] the book of acts church
[1:45:17] i want to present a gospel that was more
[1:45:19] pleasant to the eye
[1:45:22] more acceptable brother branham would
[1:45:26] tell us in the second seal he said the
[1:45:27] way that the devil got in the book of
[1:45:29] acts church
[1:45:30] was that he began to say i get there
[1:45:32] where the peasants stare witness to
[1:45:34] their masters who were wealthy
[1:45:36] and so on and they would come to
[1:45:37] meetings and they would say
[1:45:39] but we need we need to kind of dress
[1:45:42] this up
[1:45:43] you know so i bring my friends they look
[1:45:45] at this low down
[1:45:47] bunch of slaves and whatever let's kind
[1:45:49] of dress it up you know that
[1:45:51] that that bunch of shouting and speaking
[1:45:54] in tongues and
[1:45:55] and prophesying bunts we kind of got
[1:45:57] that to settle down a little bit and
[1:45:59] have a little more dignity about it
[1:46:05] we've heard that same hiss of satan try
[1:46:08] to come and talk to this bride in this
[1:46:09] last day
[1:46:13] and satan beguiled her and instead of
[1:46:16] bringing children by the birth of the
[1:46:18] word they begin to
[1:46:19] bring forth children of the church
[1:46:24] and notice instead of being named and
[1:46:27] even baptized
[1:46:28] after their of their father they began
[1:46:31] to take on the name of the mother
[1:46:36] and became methodist and baptist and
[1:46:38] presbyterian
[1:46:41] and sadly today they try to take on the
[1:46:44] name of message
[1:46:48] as if there's any saving qualities in
[1:46:51] that name
[1:46:54] and he beguiled her
[1:46:57] brought forth children not of christ
[1:47:02] as brother branham would say jesus came
[1:47:05] to his
[1:47:05] church and found her pregnant
[1:47:11] with the seed of man
[1:47:15] and for seven long ages now we've been
[1:47:18] on a journey
[1:47:20] just as the old testament had its long
[1:47:23] ages of the exodus
[1:47:24] the judges the kings and the prophets
[1:47:28] until finally there came a lamb who
[1:47:31] could cross
[1:47:32] the breach and clear the deed
[1:47:36] think of this the breach itself as
[1:47:39] brother branham called it was a breach
[1:47:42] between the church ages and the seals it
[1:47:44] was is a breach is a chasm
[1:47:47] a chasm that could not be crossed and
[1:47:51] and even this book that was sealed with
[1:47:53] seven seals and
[1:47:55] seven thunders uttered their voices
[1:47:57] making known the mysteries were sealed
[1:47:59] up
[1:48:00] and it couldn't be crossed in any other
[1:48:03] age
[1:48:05] i want you to realize you're living in a
[1:48:07] wonderful hour and a wonderful time
[1:48:11] as we can say there's never been a day
[1:48:13] like this one
[1:48:15] it's an hour of restoration it's an hour
[1:48:18] going from time back into eternity
[1:48:21] it's an hour there where the the book is
[1:48:24] being
[1:48:24] is being transferred by the hands of man
[1:48:30] amen we're still on here okay
[1:48:34] that couldn't be crossed in any other
[1:48:35] age right
[1:48:38] men tried looking into it they probed
[1:48:43] but none of them had an open book
[1:48:48] but finally a lamb that had been slain
[1:48:52] a lamb that had been slain two thousand
[1:48:54] years ago
[1:48:56] claimed now what adam lost
[1:48:59] and removed from the book of title it
[1:49:02] seals
[1:49:03] that it held it shut all right
[1:49:07] seals that it kept god's people from
[1:49:09] coming to full inheritance
[1:49:12] and this released the holy spirit
[1:49:16] in fullness back to the church
[1:49:19] that had been bound right and then
[1:49:22] sealed by denominational
[1:49:24] rivers waters multitudes
[1:49:28] of people and their ideas and myriads of
[1:49:31] books and myriads of teachings and
[1:49:34] myriads of understanding now sealed and
[1:49:36] closed the book
[1:49:38] that's right but finally there came a
[1:49:41] loud
[1:49:42] the slave line not a new laugh
[1:49:45] not a new atonement the same atonement
[1:49:49] the same holy ghost the same power
[1:49:53] amount i loosen the seals to
[1:49:56] bring a unsealed book the title
[1:50:00] back to man again your inheritance
[1:50:08] your title to a new body amen
[1:50:12] you're titled to divine healing you're
[1:50:15] titled to the earnest of your
[1:50:16] inheritance the holy ghost
[1:50:18] your title to every divine promise
[1:50:22] hallelujah a man a
[1:50:25] people of the restored faith
[1:50:29] that's where i'm standing we're a people
[1:50:32] of the restored faith
[1:50:36] not a new book of acts but
[1:50:40] a continuation of the book of acts
[1:50:45] christ in the true church is a
[1:50:48] continuation of the book of acts
[1:50:51] and i want to just tell you where we're
[1:50:53] standing it is now time to continue
[1:50:57] to write the final chapter
[1:51:02] hallelujah to write the final chapters
[1:51:04] out
[1:51:05] the book of acts of the holy ghost where
[1:51:08] he would act in
[1:51:09] man
[1:51:13] a people of the restored faith
[1:51:17] but you see sadly and as a serpent
[1:51:20] beguiled eve
[1:51:22] so did that the serpent beguiled the
[1:51:24] early church
[1:51:26] and the book became close to man and
[1:51:29] sealed and locked up
[1:51:31] its truths and its power
[1:51:34] and he set the church wandering on a
[1:51:36] long journey
[1:51:38] until the time of refreshing would come
[1:51:42] from the presence of the lord a time of
[1:51:46] restoration
[1:51:48] yes it said in second corinthians 11 3
[1:51:51] but i fear lest by any means as the
[1:51:53] serpent
[1:51:54] beguiled the eve through his subtlety so
[1:51:57] your mind should be corrupted
[1:51:59] from the simplicity that is in christ
[1:52:02] for if he preacher cometh that preaches
[1:52:04] another jesus
[1:52:05] who will not preach or receive another
[1:52:07] spirit which you have not received or
[1:52:10] or another gospel which you have not
[1:52:12] accepted you might bear well with him
[1:52:15] so you see like eve who could not wait
[1:52:18] for the promise to be fulfilled
[1:52:21] or be fruitful and multiply she
[1:52:25] instead got in a hurry remember what she
[1:52:28] did she crossed her
[1:52:29] her seed she mingled it with the
[1:52:32] serpency
[1:52:34] and when she did it brought forth a
[1:52:36] child of death
[1:52:38] and when the when the church of jesus
[1:52:41] christ
[1:52:41] was perverted in the time of wrong after
[1:52:44] a virgin birth and was given to christ
[1:52:47] in pentecost
[1:52:48] what did she do she crossed yourself
[1:52:50] with roman dogma
[1:52:53] and the protestant church did the same
[1:52:55] thing
[1:52:56] that's why they're called in the bible
[1:52:58] and harlots
[1:53:01] amen but i want you to want you to know
[1:53:03] god will not fail
[1:53:06] amen no sir he said i'll have a church
[1:53:09] and she will be without or wrinkle
[1:53:12] am i but to do so it takes a restoration
[1:53:16] and that's why the message of
[1:53:17] restoration is so
[1:53:20] vitally important
[1:53:28] and a mystery
[1:53:31] a mystery is not restored
[1:53:35] if his power still remains unlocked
[1:53:43] i said a mouthful right there but i want
[1:53:46] you to i want you to take note of this
[1:53:48] a mystery is not restored if its power
[1:53:52] still remains unlocked
[1:53:55] you're only reading what's on the
[1:53:56] outside of the seal
[1:53:59] you're not experiencing the power that
[1:54:01] is in the deed
[1:54:04] and that's exactly what is wrong with
[1:54:07] that
[1:54:07] with the many of the message churches
[1:54:10] today
[1:54:10] is their claim and the mysteries have
[1:54:13] been revealed
[1:54:14] but they know nothing of its power
[1:54:19] amen and a mystery is not restored if
[1:54:22] it's
[1:54:23] if it's power still remains unlocked
[1:54:28] amen to restore the mysteries is to
[1:54:31] return
[1:54:32] the power of it to the church
[1:54:36] so many have tasted the knowledge of the
[1:54:38] mystery
[1:54:39] and yet know nothing of its power
[1:54:43] when its power is known sin and unbelief
[1:54:46] looses its hole did you hear me
[1:54:50] amen but you see again brother brandon
[1:54:53] said it is a fact
[1:54:54] this laodicean church it is a fact
[1:54:57] that the prophet for the last day must
[1:54:59] be bringing forth a message from god
[1:55:02] that will forerun the second coming of
[1:55:04] the lord for by his message will
[1:55:06] the hearts of the children be turned
[1:55:09] back to the pinnacles of fathers
[1:55:11] and with the restoration of the word
[1:55:14] will come the restoration of the power
[1:55:19] so you cannot say because there you know
[1:55:23] the mechanics of a mystery
[1:55:26] unless the dynamics of it is there you
[1:55:29] have not
[1:55:30] received this mystery and it has not
[1:55:34] released its power how many have a
[1:55:38] knowledge of the mystery of the new
[1:55:39] birth but have experienced
[1:55:41] nothing of its power
[1:55:44] the future home brother bradham would
[1:55:46] talk about that and let me deviate just
[1:55:48] a moment
[1:55:49] as one of our themes is always about the
[1:55:52] new birth and
[1:55:53] you must be born again and against this
[1:55:55] easy believism
[1:55:57] that bursts you into just another
[1:56:00] denominational
[1:56:01] child and that's what we got
[1:56:04] today in the message today is
[1:56:07] denominational children
[1:56:10] who don't know who their father is
[1:56:13] that's why you got
[1:56:14] all of these different doctrines and
[1:56:15] thoughts and everything else
[1:56:17] because they don't know the fatherhood
[1:56:19] of the world
[1:56:21] are you with me but brother brandon said
[1:56:23] in the future at home he said just like
[1:56:25] all the curse of sin is gone when
[1:56:28] the holy ghost accepts you
[1:56:34] amen you know again we we got all the i
[1:56:37] accept christ
[1:56:38] as my personal savior that's good
[1:56:41] but what about him the holy ghost must
[1:56:43] accept
[1:56:44] you
[1:56:45] [Music]
[1:56:48] are you with me amen you say well
[1:56:51] brother tim
[1:56:51] i i i told you i i've done everything
[1:56:55] and if he has not accepted you they're
[1:56:58] still
[1:56:58] somewhere you haven't died to sin
[1:57:03] amen because when you be when you die to
[1:57:06] sin he will accept you
[1:57:08] amen amen see you don't accept it let me
[1:57:11] just go back so you get the entirety of
[1:57:13] this quote
[1:57:14] just like all the curse of sin is gone
[1:57:16] when the holy ghost accepts you
[1:57:19] see you don't accept it it except
[1:57:23] you because it's god's
[1:57:26] attribute see the holy ghost means god's
[1:57:29] spirit is the attribute the thought of
[1:57:31] god
[1:57:32] has accepted you because you were
[1:57:34] ordained for that purpose
[1:57:37] when the holy ghost comes it's simply
[1:57:39] the thought that god had of you
[1:57:41] and you in time coming together
[1:57:45] amen were you recognized i came from god
[1:57:49] i'm going back to god everybody he's my
[1:57:53] father
[1:57:55] yet you were born in sin but but god had
[1:57:57] that attribute
[1:57:58] and here you expressed yourself on earth
[1:58:01] and he comes down and gets you
[1:58:03] and you're back here here's where you
[1:58:05] belong but see sin
[1:58:06] has lost its power that's right the
[1:58:09] desire
[1:58:10] of sin has gone from your heart when the
[1:58:13] holy spirit comes in
[1:58:15] you're a restored person
[1:58:20] hallelujah amen so if you're restored
[1:58:23] you know of its power
[1:58:26] it's a power of deliverance it's a power
[1:58:29] of victory
[1:58:31] it's a power there that you have over
[1:58:33] the flesh
[1:58:34] over sin over evil
[1:58:38] oh brother get this baptism of the holy
[1:58:40] ghost
[1:58:41] when god accepts you and sin
[1:58:44] loses his power and sin desire
[1:58:48] is gone from your heart and you walk now
[1:58:50] not after the flesh
[1:58:52] but after the spirit i don't care if you
[1:58:55] have to boohoo and snot at an altar and
[1:58:58] roll on the floor in agony
[1:58:59] you stay there until your life is
[1:59:01] declaring the wonderful works of god
[1:59:04] amen we're at an end time
[1:59:08] here we are walking back into eden
[1:59:12] restoration will be complete when our
[1:59:15] bodies are
[1:59:16] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:59:18] an eye now that's for us the earth will
[1:59:20] go on in this process of restoration
[1:59:23] but that's what we need a renewing for
[1:59:27] to awaken our faith to the reality of
[1:59:30] god
[1:59:31] this is exactly the purpose of malachi 4
[1:59:34] was to turn your heart back to believing
[1:59:37] and brother branham would say we find
[1:59:39] out that we're missing something in our
[1:59:41] churches
[1:59:43] and that is the power of christ
[1:59:47] amen you know i i want to i wanted to
[1:59:49] say we're not maybe missing great
[1:59:51] preachers
[1:59:52] we're not missing maybe a great theology
[1:59:55] we're not missing great doctrines but
[1:59:58] we're missing the power of it
[2:00:01] and that's what's missing in our homes
[2:00:04] amen there's no power over the flesh
[2:00:07] that's what's missing in people's
[2:00:08] individual life
[2:00:10] that's why porn sites are being visited
[2:00:14] among those who call ourselves believers
[2:00:17] this is why adulteries
[2:00:18] and fornication are taking place even in
[2:00:21] the pulpit
[2:00:23] and i'll tell you why we're missing
[2:00:25] something is because
[2:00:26] too often pastors are still preaching
[2:00:29] reformation
[2:00:31] instead of restoration
[2:00:34] but we are not in the time of
[2:00:36] reformation
[2:00:37] we're trying to reform where men and
[2:00:39] women are getting reformed
[2:00:41] that would only produce another
[2:00:43] organizational child
[2:00:45] amen but this is where that we are being
[2:00:49] we are being transformed amen by what
[2:00:52] up complete restoration
[2:00:56] and it doesn't produce a denominational
[2:00:58] child but
[2:00:59] a restored son with power
[2:01:03] amen denominational children
[2:01:07] they always have to be reformed by
[2:01:09] constant preaching against the sins of
[2:01:11] the flesh
[2:01:14] over and over and over you hear it from
[2:01:16] over and over the sins of the flesh and
[2:01:18] your flesh and your flesh and your flesh
[2:01:20] and your flesh
[2:01:21] and your flesh and and and there are
[2:01:23] attempts to reform you
[2:01:27] that's right you know in the future home
[2:01:30] brother branham drew a
[2:01:32] human heart with a snake in it
[2:01:35] and the fruits of it on the outside
[2:01:39] that showed up in a person's life of
[2:01:41] malice and hatred and evil
[2:01:44] but it was all caused by this root
[2:01:47] of sin nature said it would be this
[2:01:50] serpent here
[2:01:51] that was coming out from him and he
[2:01:55] would explain there
[2:01:56] that to come to christ and ask for
[2:01:58] forgiveness of your sin
[2:02:00] would simply wipe away your past deeds
[2:02:05] but it didn't it doesn't deal with sin
[2:02:07] nature
[2:02:10] amen that old root of evil is still
[2:02:12] there
[2:02:14] and then you repent and you get baptized
[2:02:16] in jesus name that he forgave you of
[2:02:19] sins and
[2:02:20] and and that repentance and that
[2:02:24] ushering in and that baptism accepts you
[2:02:27] into a body of believers
[2:02:30] in the fellowship of believers but i
[2:02:32] want you to think of it
[2:02:33] it only makes you like a jew in the old
[2:02:36] testament
[2:02:38] where your sins pass are placed upon the
[2:02:41] lamb
[2:02:42] and the lamb is put into death in your
[2:02:46] place but the root of sin that made you
[2:02:49] sin
[2:02:50] is still there this was the condition of
[2:02:54] the old testament
[2:02:56] wasn't they didn't have a lamb it wasn't
[2:02:59] that the blood would not blot out their
[2:03:01] transgression
[2:03:03] it was that it had never came into the
[2:03:07] soul
[2:03:08] and they would be born of that blood
[2:03:12] i want you to hear what i'm saying amen
[2:03:15] because i
[2:03:16] i want you to understand friend if this
[2:03:18] reforming won't ever get us anywhere
[2:03:21] i can preach this and preach that and
[2:03:23] tell you this is wrong and that's wrong
[2:03:25] and it condemns you and tells you you
[2:03:28] need jesus and you come and you repent
[2:03:30] and
[2:03:30] and you ask forgiveness and and so on
[2:03:32] but unless there's an
[2:03:34] inside change unless old sin
[2:03:38] nature dies out he will come again and
[2:03:40] just put more marks against you
[2:03:43] and bring an evil testimony upon the
[2:03:46] church of jesus christ
[2:03:48] are you with me amen but i want you to
[2:03:50] hear this
[2:03:51] in romans in romans um
[2:03:54] in romans 8 11
[2:03:57] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[2:04:01] jesus from the dead dwell in you
[2:04:06] it'll make alive because he
[2:04:09] that raised the christ from the dead
[2:04:11] shall also
[2:04:12] make alive your mortal bodies
[2:04:16] by the spirit that dwelleth in you
[2:04:24] amen what your body made alive
[2:04:28] by the spirit oh you say brother tim
[2:04:30] that's future no
[2:04:31] that's when the holy ghost comes in and
[2:04:34] make sure in the future he'll quicken it
[2:04:36] he'll make it alive he'll
[2:04:38] raise it up from the dead he'll take it
[2:04:40] from a pile of ashes and make a full
[2:04:43] a person out of you again sure it will
[2:04:47] but right now if the spirit that raised
[2:04:50] up
[2:04:51] jesus from the dead if that holy ghost
[2:04:54] dwells in you
[2:04:55] it will make alive your mortal body
[2:04:59] it'll bring it in subjection
[2:05:04] oh yeah therefore brethren we are
[2:05:07] debtors
[2:05:08] not to the flesh we don't owe our flesh
[2:05:11] nothing
[2:05:13] it has no control over it and it's not
[2:05:16] to rule over us
[2:05:18] amen but listen here for you if you live
[2:05:22] at the spirit you shall or after the
[2:05:24] flesh you shall die
[2:05:26] but if you through the spirit to mortify
[2:05:28] the deeds of the body you shall live
[2:05:30] and that the spirit's indwelling we'll
[2:05:33] kill
[2:05:34] mortify the deeds of your flesh
[2:05:37] [Applause]
[2:05:38] absolutely if you ever get that man or
[2:05:41] woman converted you don't have to worry
[2:05:43] about the deeds of the flesh
[2:05:46] oh yeah amen romans 8 1
[2:05:49] said there is therefore now no
[2:05:51] condemnation
[2:05:53] to them which are in christ jesus who
[2:05:56] walk not after the flesh but after the
[2:05:58] spirit
[2:05:59] for the law of the spirit of life in
[2:06:02] christ jesus
[2:06:03] had made me free from the law of sin and
[2:06:06] death
[2:06:08] hallelujah people who walk not after the
[2:06:10] flesh
[2:06:11] but after the spirit born of his spirit
[2:06:14] washed in his blood
[2:06:16] amen the message took him brother
[2:06:18] bradley said it this way
[2:06:19] there it is it cannot perish now the
[2:06:22] light lays over
[2:06:23] it's a token it lays upon the soul of
[2:06:26] that person there is a token
[2:06:28] over there or in other words over the
[2:06:30] soul upon the soul the holy spirit
[2:06:33] that belongs to god it's his when i see
[2:06:36] the token
[2:06:36] i'll pass over you a positive token
[2:06:40] the holy spirit is our token therefore
[2:06:42] when you receive the
[2:06:44] holy ghost you have passed from death
[2:06:47] unto life that's all there is to it
[2:06:49] because there's a life in you
[2:06:51] and you can no more perish
[2:06:54] the bible said he that's born of god
[2:06:56] does not commit
[2:06:58] sin for he cannot sin for the seed of
[2:07:01] god amen the seed of god remains in it
[2:07:03] and how can he sin when the sinless god
[2:07:07] is in him
[2:07:08] when us he's in a sinless god how can he
[2:07:11] sin
[2:07:12] no matter what he's done that blood's
[2:07:14] covered him
[2:07:16] he's a new creature now his desires and
[2:07:19] ambition
[2:07:20] is of heaven because he's changed from a
[2:07:23] cuckleber
[2:07:24] to a weak his desires is not the same
[2:07:28] as it was that once was and he displays
[2:07:31] it

[2:07:33] sitting nah
[2:07:34] you're deceived it can't display nothing

[2:08:11] we know what's right but we can't do it
[2:08:16] you see them preaching yeah they're
[2:08:18] preaching about a revelation a mystery
[2:08:21] of a new birth without his power and the
[2:08:24] mystery is not known until the power is
[2:08:27] known
[2:08:29] amen calling jesus on the scene brother

[2:09:54] wrong choice

[2:10:44] brother tim you mean i no longer have a
[2:10:46] wrong thought yeah you get wrong
[2:10:48] thoughts but you quickly throw them out
[2:10:50] amen because why the holy spirit is
[2:10:53] there to convince you of sin
[2:10:58] amen you're sealed to the david dempsey
[2:11:01] that is a
[2:11:02] secure feeling such a restoration the
[2:11:05] holy spirit with complete control
[2:11:07] sin nature gone until a people
[2:11:11] becomes positioned like adam
[2:11:15] at the beginning with sin dealt with
[2:11:18] and conquered and speak
[2:11:22] the word with creative power
[2:11:25] [Music]
[2:11:27] remember this is where adam was before
[2:11:29] the fault
[2:11:30] he spoke the word with creative power
[2:11:35] amen this is the restoration power of
[2:11:38] the blood
[2:11:40] it is bringing the people back with the
[2:11:43] holy spirit
[2:11:44] with supreme control and sin
[2:11:47] nature gone until we are positioned
[2:11:50] like adam was in the beginning
[2:11:58] words i want you to think of this
[2:12:01] words with creative power
[2:12:04] save 120 in the upper room
[2:12:08] and anointed peter to preach and 3 000
[2:12:10] were added
[2:12:12] words with creative power raised a
[2:12:15] to his feet
[2:12:18] the word was open was bringing past
[2:12:21] visions voices
[2:12:24] god speaking a nearness no chasm
[2:12:31] now listen church i want to give
[2:12:33] something to you
[2:12:34] because well you know we we got the word
[2:12:38] but do we realize why the word was
[2:12:40] written
[2:12:42] brother branham would would quote the
[2:12:44] scripture jesus said if you say to this
[2:12:46] mountain
[2:12:47] be moved and don't doubt in your heart
[2:12:49] but believe what you said
[2:12:51] will come to pass you can have what you
[2:12:54] say
[2:12:55] now i've said it let it be done it is
[2:12:58] written
[2:12:59] to be spoken and i have spoken
[2:13:03] let it be done
[2:13:08] the word is written to be spoken
[2:13:15] this operation of the word spoken power
[2:13:18] is all made possible because of the
[2:13:20] blood cleansing
[2:13:23] cleansing us from the sin of adam
[2:13:26] this lamb was a slain lamb
[2:13:29] but it was also a resurrected lamb
[2:13:32] and indeed he paid for the souls
[2:13:34] redemption at calvary once and for all
[2:13:37] he resurrected and ascended but in the
[2:13:39] last day
[2:13:40] he advances to take the title of
[2:13:44] inheritance that he has
[2:13:45] paid for amen he paid for you at calvary
[2:13:50] but now he claims your inheritance
[2:13:54] in this last day amen listen
[2:13:58] he's about to do it friends the dead and
[2:14:00] christ
[2:14:01] have had their sins forgiven how many
[2:14:04] believes that
[2:14:05] those that are dead in christ have had
[2:14:08] their sins forgiven they've weighed in
[2:14:10] that great holding place of paradise
[2:14:13] amen they are at rest but they still
[2:14:16] long
[2:14:17] they are still longing to come back to
[2:14:20] earth
[2:14:20] and exchange their theophany bodies for
[2:14:24] glorified ones
[2:14:26] so they can join the living at the
[2:14:28] marriage supper of the lamb
[2:14:30] think of that and in the last days the
[2:14:33] lamb
[2:14:33] advances forth in revelation
[2:14:37] to release to the church the lost
[2:14:39] inheritance
[2:14:41] containing the word and his power that
[2:14:44] was lost
[2:14:44] in the first age
[2:14:48] and brother branham called he refers to
[2:14:50] this as the bleach
[2:14:52] now we're getting into the power
[2:14:55] amen we see the intercessor we see what
[2:14:58] he did is his work we see he was a man
[2:15:02] we see he he goes forward to take the
[2:15:04] book of title
[2:15:06] but i want you to understand a little
[2:15:08] bit of the power of his blood
[2:15:11] because you see this work in revelation
[2:15:14] 5
[2:15:15] is advancing the power of the blood
[2:15:19] the power of the kinsman redeemer to go
[2:15:22] beyond just
[2:15:23] the redeeming of our souls i mean we
[2:15:27] ought to be happy with the redeeming of
[2:15:28] our souls
[2:15:29] when we die we don't go to hell
[2:15:33] amen we go into a place of rest when we
[2:15:35] commit our loved one into the ground we
[2:15:37] can all
[2:15:38] rejoice in a way and say oh wonderful
[2:15:40] they're in a place
[2:15:41] of the beloved in the place of rest
[2:15:44] but oh church that is not all of
[2:15:46] christianity
[2:15:48] that is not our only promise but there
[2:15:52] is a greater promise than that
[2:15:55] and that is that the lost inheritance
[2:15:58] of our immortality will return
[2:16:02] to a people in this last decade
[2:16:08] and i want you to know that there's an
[2:16:10] anointing that has come down
[2:16:12] that is issuing that revelation
[2:16:15] that mystery to a church but it's not
[2:16:18] going to be just the mystery but the
[2:16:20] power of it
[2:16:21] because it'll quicken your mortal body
[2:16:28] brother branham explained it this way
[2:16:30] the bleach and he would tell
[2:16:32] what the power of the blood would do he
[2:16:34] said it's like a clorox
[2:16:36] and he said you take your a drop of ink
[2:16:39] put it into
[2:16:40] a tub of clorox and he said the coloring
[2:16:44] of that ink
[2:16:45] it begins to spin around in that that
[2:16:48] clorox
[2:16:51] the first thing that it does when it
[2:16:52] hits the clorox
[2:16:54] the chemical of that
[2:16:57] is more powerful than the ink
[2:17:01] and it begins to change it until you
[2:17:04] can't even see
[2:17:06] even a vapor of that of that ink
[2:17:09] left amen
[2:17:12] it's gone it all becomes a part of the
[2:17:15] bleach
[2:17:18] and that's exactly how the blood of
[2:17:20] jesus christ does to sin
[2:17:22] the blood of jesus amen
[2:17:26] you confess your sins upon the blood of
[2:17:29] jesus
[2:17:30] and and it emits it puts in the sea of
[2:17:32] forgiveness
[2:17:34] it puts it in the in the container
[2:17:36] bleach
[2:17:37] and it's never to be remembered again
[2:17:42] about so where is the church today
[2:17:45] brother branham asked
[2:17:46] brethren if we're born to be sons of god
[2:17:49] where do we stand
[2:17:51] he's trying to tell us we're sinless
[2:17:55] has no claim on us we're sons of god
[2:17:59] we're recognized as sons
[2:18:02] amen jesus said and this is the way he
[2:18:06] where he told us what we're standing he
[2:18:07] said jesus himself said
[2:18:09] if your own law said you're god's
[2:18:11] amateur gods would control the earth
[2:18:13] he caught he said if he called those
[2:18:14] gods who the word of god came to which
[2:18:17] was the prophets
[2:18:18] the word the lord comes to the prophet
[2:18:20] you call them gods how could
[2:18:21] you condemn me when i'm say i'm the son
[2:18:23] of god
[2:18:24] what is the bleach done there it's
[2:18:27] returned
[2:18:28] of men and women back to the state of
[2:18:31] godship again
[2:18:32] [Music]
[2:18:34] amen your own race you're no more of it
[2:18:38] you're of a new race
[2:18:42] hallelujah and you're born now
[2:18:45] of the birth of the blood of god
[2:18:50] hallelujah you're not anymore your own
[2:18:52] you're not just
[2:18:53] human anymore you are born again
[2:18:56] son or daughter of god with a claim on
[2:18:59] immortality
[2:19:00] and a deposit within you that your body
[2:19:03] is going to change that will match the
[2:19:05] soul within you
[2:19:09] think of that god's
[2:19:13] offsprings of himself sons of god
[2:19:17] under the blood born of the blood
[2:19:24] would you get the thought you know
[2:19:26] sometimes we look at songs like
[2:19:29] you know oh yes oh yes i'm a child of
[2:19:32] the king his royal blood now flows in my
[2:19:34] vein
[2:19:35] of course that's nonsense if he's
[2:19:36] talking about your flesh
[2:19:40] of course that's nonsense if you're
[2:19:41] talking about the human blood of jesus
[2:19:45] but that's not that that's not what
[2:19:47] we're saved by we're saved by the blood
[2:19:48] of god
[2:19:50] not human blood it was god's blood that
[2:19:53] was shed
[2:19:55] how did he get that blood you see he was
[2:19:57] full of human blood well he wasn't mary
[2:19:59] he wasn't joseph so what human gave him
[2:20:01] the blood
[2:20:04] amen he was of the blood cell by
[2:20:06] creation
[2:20:08] by the word the spoken word the original
[2:20:11] seed
[2:20:14] of there at calvary the blood cell broke
[2:20:17] open
[2:20:18] and released the life of it and it came
[2:20:20] back on the day of pentecost
[2:20:22] and what you were seeing there come down
[2:20:25] on the day of pentecost was the life
[2:20:27] that was in the blood amen
[2:20:33] the spirit that was in the blood
[2:20:36] the blood came down on the day of
[2:20:39] pentecost
[2:20:40] and when they were filled with the
[2:20:42] spirit that were born
[2:20:44] of the blood of god amen
[2:20:49] the bible tells you this in john chapter
[2:20:52] 1 he said who was born
[2:20:54] not of the will of flesh
[2:20:58] but of god is that right
[2:21:02] this is it it's not a rebirth by the
[2:21:04] will of flesh it is
[2:21:06] it is born the way you should have been
[2:21:09] at the beginning and it ain't flowing
[2:21:13] through the veins through these
[2:21:15] these veins of this body it's flowing
[2:21:17] through the veins of your
[2:21:19] of your by the holy spirit of your soul
[2:21:22] and it reaches out and it brings your
[2:21:24] whole body
[2:21:25] under control of the holy spirit oh i'm
[2:21:28] talking about a blessed thing friend
[2:21:31] that we are men and women born of the
[2:21:34] blood of god
[2:21:35] that god is our father
[2:21:43] if the blood of bulls and goats now
[2:21:45] could give the power to moses
[2:21:48] to go out there by commission of god and
[2:21:50] stay
[2:21:51] and stretch forth that rod and say let
[2:21:52] there come flies
[2:21:54] then how much more can sons that are
[2:21:57] born of the blood of god
[2:22:00] moses wasn't but you are come on church
[2:22:09] moses was a fallen son but you're not
[2:22:12] you are a redeemed son i'm talking about
[2:22:15] where you are standing
[2:22:18] i'm talking about the power of this
[2:22:20] blood it didn't just cleanse your sins
[2:22:25] and remove them from it it changed
[2:22:28] your nature and put in you
[2:22:31] a new nature with a new life
[2:22:36] american that holy spirit is the blood
[2:22:39] of god
[2:22:40] inside of you and you were born of the
[2:22:43] blood of god
[2:22:44] amen your kin folks this is why he can
[2:22:48] take you for a pride because he must get
[2:22:51] a woman of his kin folks
[2:22:54] someone that is born of him has the same
[2:22:57] life
[2:22:58] the same lifeblood amen
[2:23:04] was showing that if the blood of bulls
[2:23:05] and goats brother branham would use this
[2:23:08] for example he said
[2:23:09] if it's just a type it's just a type and
[2:23:12] the blood of bulls and goats
[2:23:14] could so cleanse a man and temporarily
[2:23:17] put on a man that he
[2:23:19] he would lift later and he would go out
[2:23:21] and do other things
[2:23:22] but but it would put a man on speak in
[2:23:25] terms
[2:23:26] what can the blood of the real lamb do
[2:23:34] and he would say what's the matter with
[2:23:37] the church
[2:23:38] today there's something wrong
[2:23:43] and he said my opinion we're not coming
[2:23:45] with that sincerity to the right thing
[2:23:47] for that where god could do that by the
[2:23:49] blood of bulls and goats
[2:23:51] and that only covered sin and made a
[2:23:53] perpetuation for the sinner
[2:23:55] but the sin was still there only covered
[2:23:58] over
[2:23:58] what can he do to the blood of his son
[2:24:01] that amidst sin
[2:24:11] you see this is way beyond
[2:24:14] the little nice slogans that's right
[2:24:18] you know that i'm justified just as if
[2:24:20] i'd never done it
[2:24:23] because you know you did it
[2:24:28] amen this is way beyond just as if i'd
[2:24:31] have never done it
[2:24:32] because you did it but
[2:24:36] this justification justifies you
[2:24:40] because it's not looking at your human
[2:24:43] birth
[2:24:44] and your human past
[2:24:47] [Applause]
[2:24:48] it's not taking an account your life as
[2:24:51] a human
[2:24:53] it is taking an account the birth of a
[2:24:56] son of god and you cannot attribute
[2:24:59] sin to a son of god
[2:25:01] [Applause]
[2:25:03] because he that's born of god cannot
[2:25:05] commit sin
[2:25:06] for the seed of god remains in him amen
[2:25:12] and it isn't just as if i'd never done
[2:25:15] it
[2:25:16] it is i never did it in the first place
[2:25:21] therefore i stand redeemed
[2:25:25] therefore i stand sinless
[2:25:29] therefore i because of a new birth and
[2:25:32] the old man is dead
[2:25:33] amen the man you talking about devil i
[2:25:37] ain't him no more
[2:25:47] i don't know who you're looking for but
[2:25:49] that man's dead
[2:25:52] and i'm a new creature in christ jesus
[2:25:55] and this one never did it in the first
[2:25:58] place
[2:25:59] there's never nothing in the memory of
[2:26:01] god that could ever come up and say
[2:26:03] oh oh he did this he did that and that's
[2:26:06] why
[2:26:06] i can't honor his word but god says
[2:26:10] uh-uh i can put in him the power of
[2:26:13] creation
[2:26:14] because he's my son
[2:26:19] and sons come back to the place of
[2:26:21] eating the book
[2:26:23] and prophesying again as they prophesied
[2:26:26] on the day of pentecost
[2:26:32] but he said what's the matter we're not
[2:26:34] coming with sincerity
[2:26:35] we're not realizing we're not
[2:26:38] comprehended we're not
[2:26:39] we're we're not realizing the power
[2:26:43] of where we have been placed
[2:26:47] you see this puts us back in authority
[2:26:49] as adam in the beginning
[2:26:50] operating as sons with full authority
[2:26:56] brother branham would go on and out in
[2:26:58] the message of god hiding himself in
[2:27:00] simplicity
[2:27:01] you ought to go listen to it everybody
[2:27:03] ought to make that your homework this
[2:27:04] week
[2:27:06] the one in albuquerque brother branham
[2:27:08] speaks it says in
[2:27:10] mark 11 24 whatever you say to this
[2:27:12] mountain move
[2:27:14] and don't doubt in your heart but
[2:27:15] believe what you said
[2:27:17] will come to pass you can have what you
[2:27:20] said
[2:27:21] where is the pentecostal church at today
[2:27:25] amen you don't realize that confess
[2:27:28] truly
[2:27:28] uh confessed sins amid sin there's no
[2:27:31] omit to it
[2:27:32] and he said it builds a bridge that
[2:27:35] takes man
[2:27:36] back in the presence of his creator and
[2:27:38] makes him a son of god
[2:27:42] amen and then he talks about the chasm
[2:27:44] is completely gone
[2:27:46] there's not even remembrance that there
[2:27:48] ever was a chasm
[2:27:50] god don't ever remember that you were
[2:27:52] ever strained from him
[2:27:54] because he wasn't you were always his
[2:27:57] son
[2:27:58] [Applause]
[2:28:01] and this son that he had in his mind was
[2:28:04] his bone
[2:28:05] he was born of the spirit he was born in
[2:28:08] god's blood
[2:28:09] and the devil has no claim on him
[2:28:12] [Applause]
[2:28:14] i'm talking to a people today that ought
[2:28:16] to be able to look at it and say
[2:28:18] the devil has no claim of
[2:28:21] me amen
[2:28:24] whatsoever he has no claim god taking a
[2:28:28] humble sinner and cleansing him by his
[2:28:30] blood
[2:28:30] and dropping that confessed sin
[2:28:34] into that clorox bleach of the blood of
[2:28:36] the son of god
[2:28:37] and putting his own life in him into
[2:28:40] that man by the baptism of the holy
[2:28:42] ghost
[2:28:43] then we have the genuine baptism of the
[2:28:45] holy ghost
[2:28:46] what's wrong with us amen
[2:28:50] when the tithe when elijah dropped the
[2:28:52] robe for elisha
[2:28:54] he got a double portion of it and jesus
[2:28:57] said the works that i do
[2:28:58] you shall do also and greater than this
[2:29:02] how you do for i go to my father
[2:29:04] what's wrong church
[2:29:07] now he said you called us a belt above
[2:29:09] the visions and things like that get off
[2:29:11] my back
[2:29:12] brother get down to the cross get to the
[2:29:14] gospel we don't have to impersonate
[2:29:17] why would you take an impersonation why
[2:29:19] would you take a false conception of it
[2:29:21] when the
[2:29:21] the skies are full of the genuine
[2:29:24] pentecost of power that makes a man or
[2:29:26] woman
[2:29:26] a son or daughter of god that takes him
[2:29:28] back in the presence of god amen
[2:29:30] there you are god repealing himself in
[2:29:32] humility
[2:29:34] but you've got to get away from your own
[2:29:35] thoughts you've got to let the mind that
[2:29:38] was in christ
[2:29:39] be in you you've got to stay there till
[2:29:42] every sin of fear
[2:29:46] and doubt is gone from your heart and
[2:29:50] if you're there and god doesn't take you
[2:29:52] and amid your sins and send you in the
[2:29:54] presence of god
[2:29:55] there's something wrong with your
[2:29:56] experience
[2:29:59] he said i don't care how many degrees of
[2:30:01] doctor bear with me as i share this
[2:30:03] i don't care how many degrees of doctors
[2:30:05] you have how many big
[2:30:07] church you are what kind of a big wheel
[2:30:10] you belong to
[2:30:11] how many organizations whatever it is it
[2:30:13] has nothing to do with it
[2:30:15] until your sins are confessed and in the
[2:30:18] blood of jesus christ
[2:30:19] you stand an unadulterated a born
[2:30:23] again son or daughter of god with the
[2:30:25] life of god in you
[2:30:26] to speak a word of creation let this
[2:30:29] mountain be moved
[2:30:31] and it will mind you i'm telling you
[2:30:34] that's where we're standing
[2:30:35] you're looking out here and you're
[2:30:37] seeing a new election
[2:30:39] you see or you're having even doubts
[2:30:41] about this election
[2:30:42] you're wondering if it will even hold up
[2:30:44] in court or whether
[2:30:46] how crook it will be and what the next
[2:30:48] regime will be like
[2:30:50] you're wondering about the kobet and
[2:30:52] what's going on and the trouble in the
[2:30:54] land
[2:30:54] and china and the russia and all the
[2:30:57] other threats
[2:31:04] but do you realize where you're standing
[2:31:09] that's where the world is standing but
[2:31:11] where
[2:31:12] are you standing you're standing in the
[2:31:16] in the blood of the power of this
[2:31:19] restoration
[2:31:21] worst restore the people back on
[2:31:24] speaking terms again
[2:31:26] amen will you say let this mountain be
[2:31:29] moved
[2:31:30] and it's done amen
[2:31:34] oh my brother branham said this
[2:31:37] he said this in continuation and i just
[2:31:40] want to get a
[2:31:40] view of this quotation we'll bring it to
[2:31:42] close so what did he do he humbled
[2:31:45] himself to death on good friday
[2:31:46] afternoon that he might rise
[2:31:48] on the eastern sunday to send
[2:31:52] back the holy spirit upon the church
[2:31:54] with a double portion of it
[2:31:57] that he might do the same things that he
[2:31:59] did
[2:32:01] that we might do the same things that he
[2:32:03] did
[2:32:05] he promised these signs shall follow
[2:32:07] them that believe
[2:32:08] oh and how far we get away from him by
[2:32:11] our traditions there you are
[2:32:12] god hiding himself in some in humility
[2:32:15] revealing himself in power
[2:32:16] that's the way god does it that's god's
[2:32:18] program of doing it
[2:32:20] yes sir that he might bring many sons
[2:32:23] across the council
[2:32:26] oh now notice he said he said
[2:32:30] if you cross the chasm until you
[2:32:33] know pause if you're standing in the
[2:32:35] presence of god a redeemed son
[2:32:39] and a daughter of god and the signs and
[2:32:41] wonders not of make-believe
[2:32:43] but the genuine article of god the holy
[2:32:46] spirit
[2:32:46] burns within you and what you say to
[2:32:49] this mountain it moves
[2:32:51] you believe that if it doesn't he says
[2:32:54] now
[2:32:54] is your time
[2:32:58] he said if you say i'm really hungry for
[2:33:00] god
[2:33:01] you'll keep on standing till it comes
[2:33:03] there's no end to it you're persistent
[2:33:05] like the
[2:33:06] symphonies and woman she couldn't take
[2:33:08] no she really wanted it
[2:33:12] amen and then this prayer he said lord
[2:33:15] jesus
[2:33:16] in the way of humility and the way of
[2:33:19] humbleness
[2:33:21] i offer to you this congregation that's
[2:33:23] on their feet i offer them to you
[2:33:25] because
[2:33:26] they have stood in response to the call
[2:33:27] they're seeking a deeper
[2:33:29] things they're seeking more life after
[2:33:33] hearing the blood of jesus so
[2:33:36] thoroughly cleanses us that there's no
[2:33:39] more nothing that the complete
[2:33:43] word of god rests within them
[2:33:49] that the very command of their own voice
[2:33:52] is creative power
[2:33:54] because in them is the holy ghost
[2:33:57] and this holy ghost is a creator he
[2:34:00] makes things come to pass
[2:34:02] because he speaks the word and the word
[2:34:05] spoken becomes
[2:34:06] god in action
[2:34:10] here we are we come down to the journey
[2:34:14] of the last seven ages
[2:34:16] we returned right again to where adam
[2:34:20] was
[2:34:21] to where the first church was
[2:34:24] we stand here right in the place of
[2:34:26] restoration
[2:34:29] restoration wasn't friends just to pull
[2:34:31] you out of denominations and bring you
[2:34:33] into a church called yourself message
[2:34:36] restoration was to bring you back into
[2:34:38] sonship
[2:34:40] to restore you back to place of
[2:34:42] authority again
[2:34:44] where that you who know your god does
[2:34:46] exploits
[2:34:48] because we are standing on the precipice
[2:34:51] of of
[2:34:52] where we can't go any other way but up
[2:34:56] listen you're surrounded you're like the
[2:34:59] children of israel
[2:35:01] you're standing there and there's no way
[2:35:03] to go
[2:35:05] i mean mountains on this side mountains
[2:35:07] on that side the enemy coming behind you
[2:35:09] and nowhere to go except forward
[2:35:13] and you know it's a precipice or it's a
[2:35:15] it's a it's a it's a sea
[2:35:17] then you've gotta that has walled you
[2:35:19] off and you know you're right there
[2:35:22] and you're standing there and you're
[2:35:24] looking at it and you see what's coming
[2:35:26] in and you see
[2:35:27] there's no way of escape and we have
[2:35:29] reached the point
[2:35:31] that there is no way of escape
[2:35:35] we're cut off from every side we're cut
[2:35:38] off
[2:35:38] from all the all from every hope of
[2:35:41] salvation
[2:35:43] you can't you can't depend on your
[2:35:45] election processes
[2:35:46] you can't depend on some medicine
[2:35:50] that'll come along
[2:35:51] you can't depend on anything there's
[2:35:53] somebody with me
[2:35:54] you're here and you're forced into a
[2:35:56] place
[2:35:59] amen and the people of god are beginning
[2:36:01] to cry
[2:36:03] and say oh god why is this and how come
[2:36:06] that
[2:36:06] and lord since the fathers have fallen
[2:36:08] asleep and the prophet is gone
[2:36:10] all things remain as it was from the
[2:36:12] beginning and god
[2:36:13] is saying i had not showed you over and
[2:36:16] over again
[2:36:17] haven't i showed you the power in my
[2:36:19] word didn't it make the cripples walk
[2:36:22] didn't it make them lame to walk the
[2:36:24] blind to see
[2:36:25] the depth to hear not just one occasion
[2:36:29] come on church
[2:36:31] amen then i'm showing yourself myself
[2:36:33] alive
[2:36:34] among you amen there's healing of cancer
[2:36:37] there's healing the brain bleeds
[2:36:39] crippled children are walking things are
[2:36:41] happening the death is hearing
[2:36:44] amen things are beginning to happen in
[2:36:46] the church why are you crying to me
[2:36:49] speak and go powered amen it's not the
[2:36:53] end it's the beginning it is not the
[2:36:56] end it's the continuation it is not the
[2:37:00] end it's a bride going home time
[2:37:13] and we'll come back
[2:37:18] to the place where church
[2:37:21] lost his first love
[2:37:24] and there's a people that's got their
[2:37:27] first love back
[2:37:32] they've left everything to follow him
[2:37:36] and they want him more than anything
[2:37:45] the blood and his power restoration
[2:37:49] we're here right on the brink
[2:37:54] can i just go back just for a moment and
[2:37:57] i want to just bring out
[2:37:58] just a couple little quotes as we come
[2:38:01] to the close
[2:38:03] i want to just read just a couple of
[2:38:06] little
[2:38:07] things that are very powerful creative
[2:38:11] work brother branham said
[2:38:13] that belongs in the church of jesus
[2:38:15] christ today under the blood of jesus
[2:38:17] christ
[2:38:18] by his word that we're in contact with
[2:38:20] him creative
[2:38:22] work belongs
[2:38:26] god showed him that we are there as he
[2:38:28] quotes
[2:38:29] if you say to this mountain he said then
[2:38:32] it isn't
[2:38:33] i speak anymore it's deity speaking
[2:38:36] and he says i truly believe
[2:38:40] that the church is on the brink of one
[2:38:43] of the greatest
[2:38:44] outpourings that's ever had in this age
[2:38:48] i believe i can't say the lord has told
[2:38:51] me but it's just something inside me
[2:38:52] that's just catching hold of something
[2:38:54] that i haven't seen all my life till
[2:38:57] just now
[2:38:58] and how glorious it is to know that just
[2:39:00] before they come to the lord that these
[2:39:02] things
[2:39:04] are happening
[2:39:08] and as he closes out his ministry he
[2:39:11] stands
[2:39:12] and he says this and then knoweth it not
[2:39:16] one of the last sermons preached
[2:39:20] in jeffersonville to his home church
[2:39:23] i'm only building
[2:39:31] a lot of people have come to conclusion
[2:39:34] that brother branham was the end of this
[2:39:38] that he was exactly what god wanted
[2:39:41] and was thinking and that's all it is
[2:39:45] but brother branham said i'm only
[2:39:48] building
[2:39:50] the hour is close at hand when you're
[2:39:54] going to see
[2:39:54] something happen when something's going
[2:39:57] to take place
[2:39:59] and all of this background here
[2:40:04] he calls everything in the past
[2:40:07] background
[2:40:08] amen oh that would be blasphemous to
[2:40:12] many
[2:40:12] in many messy circles say that was the
[2:40:15] background
[2:40:19] and all this background here has only
[2:40:21] been laying a foundation
[2:40:23] for a short quick message that will
[2:40:27] shake
[2:40:28] the whole nations
[2:40:35] the bride must prophesy
[2:40:40] [Music]
[2:40:46] again
[2:40:49] we've been eating the book a long time
[2:40:54] it's time to let the spirit fall
[2:40:58] and as it falls so anointed people
[2:41:03] not in human ways
[2:41:06] but he come out of there quickened
[2:41:09] speaking the word changing things
[2:41:14] we're on the edge
[2:41:18] very soon and let me tell you i can
[2:41:21] bring you the quotes to show you
[2:41:23] but brother branham is clear that this
[2:41:26] living bride
[2:41:28] will call the resurrection
[2:41:33] and i don't think it'll be me and you
[2:41:34] out there at a graveyard screaming and
[2:41:36] crying
[2:41:37] i think it'll be when our lives are
[2:41:40] shouting out
[2:41:42] the wondrous works of god
[2:41:45] that soon the dead in christ will just
[2:41:47] walk in among us
[2:41:53] walk right down these aisles come right
[2:41:56] to you wherever you are in the house
[2:42:00] and you'll know
[2:42:04] when you see them you're being changed
[2:42:07] from
[2:42:08] mortal to immortality
[2:42:13] because this blood has that power of
[2:42:16] restoration
[2:42:22] let's fire heads together the musicians
[2:42:25] come this morning
[2:42:30] but you look at it just a moment
[2:42:34] it's got a power restoration for you my
[2:42:36] center friend
[2:42:41] you can come to jesus you don't have to
[2:42:44] come
[2:42:45] to an angry god who's been offended let
[2:42:47] me tell you something
[2:42:49] your life offends him it offends him
[2:42:54] it offends him when our women or women
[2:42:57] put on
[2:42:58] garments that pertain to man or men
[2:43:00] dressed like effeminate like women
[2:43:03] it offends them when we want to be like
[2:43:07] the world and
[2:43:09] and so forth the world rather than
[2:43:12] the cleanliness and the purity of god
[2:43:15] it offends him when we won't stand for
[2:43:18] truth and righteousness
[2:43:20] this god is offended
[2:43:25] but there is a compassionate lord
[2:43:28] oh yeah he's the same god but he became
[2:43:30] a man
[2:43:32] so that you'd have an approach
[2:43:36] your offense that has offended him
[2:43:40] that has alienated you that you'd have
[2:43:43] an approach to him
[2:43:47] and he says to you
[2:43:53] come to me come to me that you that are
[2:43:56] heavy laden
[2:43:59] i will give you rest
[2:44:04] there's rest
[2:44:08] come to me i'll take your burden
[2:44:12] i'll take the burden of sin i'll set you
[2:44:15] free
[2:44:16] i'll make you a son or daughter of god
[2:44:20] come to me he that comes to me i will in
[2:44:23] no wise cast them out
[2:44:28] come to me my yoke is easy my burden's
[2:44:30] light
[2:44:33] why wouldn't you want to come to him
[2:44:36] when a king walked among us
[2:44:40] when he bore our shame when he paid the
[2:44:42] price redemption when he gave water
[2:44:45] to those that were weary food to those
[2:44:48] that were hungry
[2:44:51] why wouldn't we want to come to him
[2:44:55] why would we wait
[2:44:59] is there a pull in your heart that that
[2:45:02] name that's on the book
[2:45:05] that mystery there in the book is
[2:45:07] calling your name and
[2:45:09] you hear a call and it's moving you
[2:45:14] saying come unto me come unto me
[2:45:17] [Music]
[2:45:20] i'll make your burdens easy i'll take
[2:45:23] them
[2:45:25] i'll bear your shame
[2:45:28] your reproach i'm taking a wipe away
[2:45:31] every sin
[2:45:32] stain that's in your life make you free
[2:45:37] come to me come to jesus
[2:45:41] the compassionate one that looks down on
[2:45:43] the blindness of your heart
[2:45:47] the compassionate one that looks at you
[2:45:49] as a sinner whose life says i'm unclean
[2:45:51] i'm unclean
[2:45:54] the compassionate one saying i will
[2:45:59] be thou clean
[2:46:06] lord jesus you see where we're standing
[2:46:10] lord i somehow don't have words
[2:46:14] eloquent enough to say it somehow
[2:46:16] another i don't have the vocabulary to
[2:46:18] bring it somehow
[2:46:20] lord maybe somebody else could do it
[2:46:24] in in a way that it could be grasped
[2:46:28] and we come to sincerity what about
[2:46:31] men and women today when brother branham
[2:46:34] was told the very same thing in order to
[2:46:36] bind this serpent
[2:46:37] you've got to be more sincere and he
[2:46:40] would even say to us
[2:46:43] what's wrong with your church where are
[2:46:44] you standing what's wrong with the
[2:46:46] church anyhow
[2:46:47] if you have the baptism of the holy
[2:46:49] ghost and the blood has cleansed
[2:46:50] cleansing
[2:46:51] we're not coming in the sincerity of the
[2:46:54] thing
[2:46:56] i pray lord you'll help us to realize
[2:46:59] where we're at
[2:47:00] in time as it blends into eternity
[2:47:05] knowing lord we're here on the precedent
[2:47:08] of a great
[2:47:09] a great message that comes forth from
[2:47:11] the bride as he prophesies again
[2:47:16] i ask it in jesus name
[2:47:19] we just come among your people today
[2:47:21] walk among us
[2:47:23] wipe away every sin stain as we baptize
[2:47:28] this young brother today lord may you
[2:47:30] baptize him with the holy ghost
[2:47:33] as we come in obedience to the word
[2:47:36] cleanse us from every sin lord we pray
[2:47:40] in jesus name thank you lord that we
[2:47:43] don't have to walk after the deeds of
[2:47:45] the flesh
[2:47:47] thank you lord that this is not a
[2:47:49] reformation but a transformation
[2:47:51] thank you lord that we have a power
[2:47:54] within us
[2:47:55] that give us power because of the blood
