to numbers chapter 33 and verse 53 and that's just worship the Lord together as we look into the word a man we have some exciting things here from the Word of God and for what he's done for us a man he has been so good to us Amen umbers chapter 33 verse 53 and ye shall dispossessed the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein for I have given you the land to possess it and this means to seize the dispossessed to take possession of to inherit to disinherit to occupy to be an heir and then John chapter 4 first John chapter 5 verse 4 first John chapter 5 verse 4 for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith amen god bless you as you're seated she's not able to be here with us today but we have a new addition to the family Butler Michael Dexter and his wife Bethany my daughter has given birth to a new grand a new grandchild for us Karen and my and my my wife and I we have this new little one that the Lord has blessed us with and of course Michael and Bethany are proud parents and William and drew welcomed them big brother again and big brother any man that are real proud to have this little one and part of the family and we is even in like tavern I feel proud to have her a part of our church family amen so we want to say congratulations to them now if you remember this was one of the promises I claimed at the ruins Shilo when I was in Israel we had some real situations that had come up there with Bethenny we'll be talking about it here for a moment but I want you to remember as we have been coming to this moment the Holy Spirit just directed me as we have been spiritually talking about some great things about the new birth I've been preaching about the barren church bringing forth Christ back to the earth again and that we have returned to the Pentecost the land of the Holy Ghost and that there's to be a church born of the breath of God and asking is there any strength to bring forth and that we that it is a battle for our inheritance and so all of these sermons you know leading up and now we have this little baby that has come to birth and see yourself is a miracle baby and I believe that it's a sign to us amen that there is strength to bring forth and amen but it's going to be a battle it surely will be a battle after four miscarriages then a image and the uterus at six weeks along in the pregnancy at 12 weeks they couldn't find the heartbeat until we got we got to pray in and they and then they could find it and then at 19 weeks they discovered that she had a two cord vessel instead of a normal three and this caused concern by the doctors that this baby wouldn't develop normally at 29 weeks the stomach and legs were judged to a measured as too small and it was that we're very concerned about this and you know so this was something that was great or great concern actually sometimes earlier in the summer I think God is so good to us because I had a very very vivid dream and I saw Bethany handing me a little dark headed little girl with curly hair about five eight months old I'm not sure exactly what her age was but as she handed her to me I saw especially you know the little fat legs were and feet were bare as she handed her to me and I looked at him and they were perfectly formed and normal so when this news came that it wasn't you know that was underdeveloped and I had that was way too big for the body and and the stomach that was not developed and the legs underdeveloped I knew that wasn't true because I'd already seen her in God good to us so you know it was too late for Satan to try that because I'd already seen it but right after the fall meetings Bethany was to go for a checkup and to determine the growth of the child and and so on as she was under the care of a specialist and on Saturday at the fall meetings you will remember brother Ron prayed for her and on the following Tuesday was her doctor's checkup and they were amazed at her stomach and legs had nearly doubled in size and at birth she is a proportionate healthy baby passed every test in her exam by the pediatrician Amen hallelujah what a mighty God mighty God sometimes you know even in those moments your faith is tried you have many highs and many lows and many - you know many victories and then it looks like the the enemy comes again and right down to the end our faith was tested my Michael Dexter was there as you know he's a and are in that and so he was there in the delivery room with his wife and child and and normal neonate heart rate is generally 120 to 160 s it begins below hundred at after birth they are often required extra oxygen to help the heart rate if it gets below sixty after the birth and oxygen hadn't helped they sometimes require chest compressions and Bethany's labor progressed very rapidly and Michael said that as we started getting closer to the time of delivery the contractions really intensified and I noticed the baby's heart rate had dropped down to the low 60s for a little bit and then came back up as the contractions grew harder the heart rate kept dropping again this can mean that the cord is getting compressed and the charge nurse commented on and said we may need to move her move real quickly here she's having heart rate issues but he just silently prayed that the Lord would protect her and he knew that after all we had come through there was no way we could have a major issue like this right now and not come through with the victory and so she delivered fine without requiring any emergency procedures are needing any additional oxygen although the nurses had it set up and ready to go because of the heart rate concern so she's certainly a miracle baby and we're getting ready for another miracle a man for another miracle a man too many vindications to believe otherwise we we had God sign and the scripture given to me at the Sea of Galilee as I looked early in the morning and looked across the Sea of Galilee and was so moved because as the Sun came at the rising of the Sun and I just realized our Lord Jesus and the disciples and many others down to the ages had looked across that sea at the very same Sun and as I as I did scripture came to me it was very very pertinent to this then as we as we there prayed about the that very thing brother Timothy have a vision the sister asked her given birth to a child and we had a prayer and a witness at Shiloh and an angel visitation also right here in the in the church you remember that and brother Michael coming out and telling about the bump in the boat we won't go into all of this today but I just want to say we're walking in the vision a man and your name was called there two amens of the promises for Candace also and forever and for a barren church because that was really upon my heart is and not only for a barren church for it but for barren souls that have never brought forth of birth Amen of the Holy Ghost in their lives my prayer for was that to a man and we've seen God bein doing a lot of things now of course of course we didn't come down to this end and have a stillborn baby we had a baby with life in it a man and it came with emotion it came with shouting or screaming out and just um III think what brother Branham said about a stillborn births he said what we need today is a good old heartfelt religion let me tell you something if a baby's born that baby don't cry don't whine they don't open his little mouth and say a thing well you know nothing happens what's the matter with the baby he's born dead and he said I think we still we got too many still births today yeah in the church fella come up and say do you believe God the Father Almighty Creator heaven earth Jesus Christ son yes I do we you promise to do so and so for this church yes take his a little salt shake and and drop a few drops of water on him and give him the right hand of fellowship and put him in Church that stillborn babies yeah what happened when a baby born if he don't cry as soon as he drops the earth what's the first thing you do to him is pick him up and turn him over your arm and give him a little what do you call it you paddle him that's right you give him a little a few wraps like that and the first thing you know why here here he goes you got a baby living and that's what it needs today in the church is is not somebody to say now I know it might not be the right thing to do that little fide thing but you need a preacher behind the pulpit that it to you that a tear you to pieces do you get squallin out once in a while and that God come in and let something take place and then you're born not that somebody you baby around your sins and say oh well our forefathers believe that and our forefathers my Bible said it's right that's what's right is our Bible and the same Holy Ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost which we all know is the birth of the new church if that same honest spirit doesn't bring the same experience to you then you've got a different Holy Spirit than what that was exactly right if it don't make you a live a sacrificial life a life full of joy and pleasure and the baptism of the Spirit leading you into signs and wonders and miracles and things there's that there's something happened Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe a man so and just I want you to share this one with you just in case some would think that changed after the seven seals was open let me read you from birth pains he said now you take some little kind of a shock maybe wouldn't have to spark him but shock him a little bit the very idea of him being born sometimes would do him grab him shake him he don't start breathing spank him a little and then he yells having the unknown tongues himself I guess but anyhow he's making a noise and I think if a baby is born just by still birth with no sound no emotion that's a dead baby and that's what's the matter with the church today the system we got too many still more than children that's right they need a gospel spankin you see so wake them up to bring them to their selves so that God can breathe the breath of life into them we know that's so true he said his crude theology but it's a truth anyhow we're gonna be speaking today about our land of promise again where we of course have been speaking is about that the people the people of the book have returned to the land of the book and then we're going to be speaking today on this part as faith is our victory now I was speaking last Sunday on the battle for our inheritance and so we've been speaking on that line but faith is our victory we must seize it from the enemy remember we cannot be apathetic about this we must we cannot be lukewarm about this we must must say this is I'll and this is our inheritance and God gave it to me and I'm gonna receive that a man now the Bible said that ye shall dispossessed the inhabitants of the land which means take possession out inherit to occupy and we must proclaim ourselves as an heir to it I am an heir to this land God has given it to me now you know we are in the greatest battle ever fought we would really look in Revelation 12 and you could see there's a war going on for heavenly places where Lucifer and Michael are battling it out in Revelation 12 and then where did we find that he's cast to the earth and when he does there's a redeemed people that are caught up into the heavens and that they are saying now is come salvation and the Kingdom of our God and so as we're speaking about that we know we're in a great battle in this end time and and just to quote brother branham from the greatest battle ever father said on the great hour of charge is at hand hallelujah soldiers with armors cleamen and colors streaming faith and doubt is set in yourself an array in this tabernacle this morning down on one side faith on the other soldiers standing supposed to duty hallelujah our captain the morning star leads own he never goes back he don't know the word retreat he don't have to retreat the greatest battle ever fought he's going on right in here now yes sir between life and death between sickness and health between Liberty and bondage the battle his own shyness fears soldiers polish up the armor God is getting his soldiers ready Amen God anoints his army so I believe that God is prepared and called the people for this end amazed to take their stand as the sons and daughters of God and God gave us the greatest weapon to defeat the devil with and of course that's the Word of God but Satan wants to take the power out of it and he wants us to to disbelieve our weapon and he also wants us to know it's okay to have the Word of God so Kate out the weapon and as long as we never use it as long as we never pull the sword and and it just says a piece of decoration and in the sheath that is just a badge of honor I've got the Word of God I I have the I have the Bible have the truth but again it is a weapon and man it is to be a sword and the word is a weapon but faith is the trigger Batman without Phase II you cannot please God without faith you cannot subdue kingdoms you cannot wrought righteousness you cannot obtain promises you cannot stop the mouths of Satan that ruin line that goes about seeing who he may devour you know you cannot quench the violence of the fire you cannot turn to flight the armies of the aliens you cannot quit the fiery darts of the wicked without faith you are powerless you are weak and you and the Word of God is ineffective but with faith all things are possible with faith we can subdue kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of Satan and then quits the violence of the fire turned to flight the armies that the aliens quits all the fiery darts of the wicked we can speak to any mountain we can cast out Devils we can tread on serpents and scorpions without being harmed we can heal the sick we can save the lost and we can overcome all things in this land is much different from the land of Egypt hey man it's so much different from the land of bondage what we were once slaves to sin and slaves the Satan in this land we're not slaves a member in this Lander a man who we are a new creation in this land I am redeemed from the curse of the law hallelujah a man I'd like you to look with me in Galatians three and thirteen for Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law I want you to notice here God has redeemed you from the curse God has redeemed you from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is every one that hangeth on the tree so Jesus would take our curse that the blessing of Abraham or what's these words now they're very key the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith now the blessing of Abraham was there was to be a seed remember and blessing I will bless you I'm gonna give you a child but it was more than Isaac and it was certainly more than Ishmael but it was a seed and it would be a royal seed and this seed which would be Christ the Messiah and it would be this seed that all nations would be blessed are you with me now so the blessing of Abraham was that would come a seed a messiah that through whom the blessings would come and that blessing of course is the gift of the Holy Spirit and then the spirit of Jesus that would give you the power to live above sin and unbelief you see now the law itself was not a curse the curse is the penalty levied for not keeping the law and all of us were guilty all of us a man and you remember brother Timothy's Wednesday night sermon how many enjoyed that and God bless him where he's serving the Lord today over in North Carolina preaching you'll be back tomorrow pray for him but remember brother Tim of these wonderful sermon them being blessed a man but I want to show you here's what happened if you didn't keep the law and here's our condition because James 2 in 10 says this for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he's guilty of all of it because no man of his own self can live holy it takes the power of the Holy Ghost but let's just look at a moment and I didn't want to get on his subject material so I asked his permission to bring this this morning a man but Deuteronomy 28 verse 15 let's just look back at some of the things that in this chapter because he would be blessed but if you would offend the law if you would break the law if you didn't keep the law then you would come under a curse is that right and so verse 15 brings it down and says it shall come to pass if you will not hearken to the voice of the Lord God to observe all his Commandments and his taxes which I command thee this day that all these curses shall come upon thee and overtake thee well actually we were all born in this condition disobedient to God so breakers of the law and because of that the curses of the law came upon us somebody wake up your neighbor and tell him where you jerks all right so now notice in verse 16 it's that cursed shall beat not be in the city and curse it's how about be in the field and curse it remember all these were blessings but now Kerstin shall be that basket and I store and curse should be thy that fruit of that would body and the fruit of thy land and the increase of thy kind and the flux of thy seat and curses shall be thou shalt be will now come and stand and curtsied shall be when thou goest out and the Lord shall send upon thee cursings and vegetations and rebuke and all that thou settest the hands and said what to do until they'll be destroyed and until thou perish quickly because of the wickedness of that doing were by thou has forsaken me and this is the case of every sinner today there under the judgments of God and Satan has a right to implement every one of these and the Lord shall make the postulants cleave unto thee until he has consumed me from off the land whether thou go to possess the Lord will smite thee with consumption that's tuberculosis and with a fever and with inflammation and with extreme burning that's neuropathy and with the sword and with blasting and with mildew and they shall pursue thee until thou perish shall be brass and the earth that is under thee shall be iron and the Lord shall make the rain of the island powder and dust for heaven shall come down upon thee from heaven it shall come down upon thee until thou be destroyed and the Lord shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies thou shalt go out one way against them and flee seven ways before them and thou shall be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth this is a life you live before you are cursed but now this is what you have been redeemed from therefore the blessings of Abraham are yours and in fact of the matter is when you couldn't when you couldn't meet the requirements of the law with his perfections Jesus the perfect one came and paid the price for you met the requirements of the penalty of the law so that you don't have to meet them that's the good news this morning that way you can be blessed because of him a man this is your salvation a man the life you live before but now you have been redeemed therefore your Redemption you have the redemption that is promised now instead of sickness and dreaded diseases health and instead of running from your enemies they're gonna run from you seven ways and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee a [Applause] man I just love it church the blessings are going to come upon you and overtake him they're gonna come running after you and catch up with ya wherever you are so that you can receive the benefits of your salvation hallelujah and verse 4 says that infant brother Timothy shared this but I'm just touching this briefly he's talked about you will prosper and so blessed shall be the fruit of your body the fruit of that ground the fruit of that cattle the increase of that kind and the flux of thy sheep and blessed shall be the basket and iced-over verse 7 the Lord shall caused an enemy's to rise against thee that rise against thee to be smitten before that face they shall come against me one way and flee before these seven ways the Lord shall establish you as a holy people unto himself as he is sworn unto thee and all the people of the earth shall see thee that thou are called by the name of the Lord and they should be afraid of thee and the Lord shall make thee Plymouth's and goods in the fruit of that body in the fruit of that cattle in the fruit of the ground in the fruit of the land in the land which the Lord swear unto God father's to give thee and the Lord shall open up to be his good treasures the heaven to give the rain unto the land in his season and that bless all the works of the hand and the set lens of many nations and the soundbar oh and the Lord shall make thee the head and not the tail and thou shalt be above only and thou shalt not be beneath if thou shalt hearken unto the commandments of the LORD thy God which I commanded thee this day to observe them to do them and furthermore he says and I will put none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought from among the Egyptians for I am the lord that healeth thee that's its promise to you I'm not gonna put a disease on you so if it comes is from the devil and if it's from the devil we have a right to cast it out a man now the tactic of the devil is to get you to disbelieve your weapon God's Word but the moment you disbelieve your weapon you're disarmed because only that hand of faith can hold the sword of the word now so again we're to take the word and to phim because he said in my name they shall cast out devils now Jesus prove this to us on the on the mountain of temptation that the devil can that defeated even the garden can be conquered by the word hey man here he got the devil defeated Eve by adding to the word and discredit in the word and causing her to disbelieve the word man Jesus meets the devil in the garden of - and not in the Garden of Eden but in - in the place of temptation hey man were all the powers of hell came against him I'm convinced it wasn't a demon that came and attacked Jesus it was Lucifer himself and was questioning if thou be the Son of God by the way if he will question Jesus if he's the son of God what about you don't you think he'll question you don't you think he'll try to put down upon your experience now some but Jesus proved that the Word of God will defeat the devil he and to do this farce he didn't use his powers he didn't use his gifts he didn't use some supernatural ability that you don't have he used the word and he simply took what was written and applied it to the situation he beat the devil with him on every point the devil came against him hallelujah you know why this is because God intends you to have dominion he does not intend you to be a defeated person [Applause] faith is not defeat faith is a victory now in the beginning Adam ruled having dominion over the earth the Bible would say in in Genesis 1:26 God said let us make man in His image after our likeness let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air over the cattle over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so Adam ruled the earth but he ruled the earth by faith you see he he could rearrange the mountains he's held brother Tim honey we know he could do that I'll tell you how we know he could do it because God gave him dominion and then jesus said if you believe you can say to this mountain is that right Amen so we know then that Jesus was pulling from somewhere because this was a man in his original position to be to be the inheritor of the earth to own the title deed to it to be in possession of all things have everything underneath his feet now remember some bad faith he he could control and rearrange the mountains could rearrange the rivers the trees they could say to them be plucked up here and moved up and on the disk on privet to you the Bible tells you after the curse came he had to do this by the sweat of the brow so you know he wasn't sweating doing what we do we wanted to removed it takes a lot of sweat to do it we either dig it up or slow it down or do something to move it right and that takes a lot of sweat but Adam didn't need any sweat he had faith in what God made him and he had dominion and he spoke and he expected it to be done are you with me so he could rearrange the mountains the rivers he can move the trees by the law of faith and jesus said himself if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed you can say to this sack of mine tree be that plucked up and cast into the sea and it'll be done even as you said is that the Bible a man now of course Satan was there oh yeah he was treading upon the earth watching looking for a way in and seeing how he he could come and and bring deception and deceive and he's over there but he had no power to do anything about it he couldn't stop at him when he said move this tree he couldn't stop at him when he he you know there was nothing he could do and man he could he all he can do is just pace around and then look and watch him oh my isn't isn't that marvelous hey man look at the power that he has here he is he's controlling the atmosphere he says it's a little windy today Adam peace be still how do we know that second Adam did that is that right looked over the brow of the boat and the bow of the boat and looked out and saw the winds and the waves and the Baffler swamped the boat and said peace be still didn't matter how big the wind was hey man he went but he was controlling my faith I want you to understand everything is by faith by faith and a lot of times when faith becomes very mysterious to people as to what faith is faith is simply believing that God's Word is true and he'll do what he said he would do that's all faith is it just simply believing God's Word it's true and God's going to perform what he said that he cannot lie hey man that's faith now so you see Satan was as I said but his power was limited he couldn't work there was nothing he could do until something was broken and so he can do is just watch him controlled the atmosphere the animals he didn't have to raise his voice hey man he doesn't he doesn't not to shout or scream at everything all he has to do is say it speak and it happened hey man and so Adam could say tree here's my view of that mountain move over a little bit about about ten feet you see you know he he is operating as the god of the earth that I read the scripture that he gave his Dominion Genesis 1:26 he said let him have dominion over the fish of the sea the found the air the cattle over every all the Earth's and every creeping thing that creepeth on the earth and so he had Dominion that was given to him by God so he had the word that placed him in that position and then he had faith in that word to operate that position are you with me now so now as he did you know as I said as long as faith was in effect as long as Adam walked by faith and live by faith Satan's power was broken now this is why Satan tries to get every Son of God to doubt this is why Jesus that he did the first thing after Jesus received the Holy Ghost forgave him to doubt his experience and Jesus had an experience so does every other child of God when you get the Holy Ghost it's not an imagination it's not a profession of faith it is an experience where heaven comes down and cleanses the soul and purchase you a man is an individual and comes to indwell are you with me but this is what Satan tried to get him to doubt you see but it was given the Adam that I'll be turn alive and as long as he ate from that tree of life he had eternal life Adam ruled over the earth he was like an amateur God over the earth everything was just given in his hand because hereit's was his he could do with it whatever he wanted to do and he named it there wasn't an animal that he didn't name he called him to himself and he named him one by one and whatever he named it that was the name thereof hey man he was truly a son of God but now in the foul Adam forfeits the title deed to that to the whole earth even to our own bodies which is earth and Adam was of course unable to redeem you see he could not redeem his rights he didn't redeem his rights because he couldn't read him his rights but Satan which does not rightfully on it I want you to get it because he got it by the seat it wasn't given to him by God and to through the only anything you're gonna have to receive it from God but he didn't receive it from God but he he possesses it he's got squatter's rights upon it and but he does not legally are rightfully on it he only possesses it hey man now he holds it in his hand death is in his hand the earth is in his hand the world belongs to him every nation belongs to him he governs and controls a whole world and everything in the world that's Satan but that's not his original place that was our place Adam ruled in that position and Adam did it with no mind battles he would say to this mountain and there was nothing there that said you know you you know hey you're just a man now you know you you know are you gonna do that with your muscles you know physically you can't do this how houses don't go all the work all these mind battles he spoke to the wind and the trees and he didn't have a headache or didn't take in his body no it contains while he was speaking to her that was something that was reminding him of his humanity or his mortality he didn't have a sign of age he didn't have any sickness somebody help me preach now Adam here he's over here speaking and all of this he don't have any sickness in his body he's never been sick he don't know what it means to be sick he doesn't have a negative thought to overcome he's never had to overcome anything he is operating in a perfect round in a plan a perfect world in a perfect Eden are you with me he moves it moves Mountain and us in his feets not hurting his back isn't aching he don't give a headache from working too long in the Sun you know he speaking and rearranging the earth and he has no scars of his past what a what his friends why or why he is commanding or while he is operating or is somebody with me there's nothing whispering him about his past and why you should not receive this because of your past hey man there's no reminders of any sin that he ever did he's standing in and the perfect Eden he doesn't know fear he's not afraid it's not gonna happen he's not wondering am I talking as a madness timer is a god at this time a man is never afraid of anything he had no doubts to overcome he didn't have an evil thought to cast down he did this whole thing without a battle can you imagine that I mean he said to the mouths of him and he didn't have a battle wasn't a war in his mind it was a sign in his body there was an ache in his back there was nothing that reminded him of mortality hey man he prophesied that's what he was doing somebody help me preach now he prophesied he foretold what was going to happen he can I say it again he prophesied I want to get it he operated as a son of God so he foretold what was going to take place he said let this mountain be moved moved over there and it happened he prophesied that in happening but he did it without a mind battle without scars of his past without memories affection reasoning without science come along and say this is impossible for you to do this or religion to come along and say God doesn't heal our days of miracles our past God doesn't do those things anymore or that was only for the apostles of war there's no reminded him some other person you know comes along as though not on a wait a man don't try to take the prophets place be careful here dog don't move out of your position he knew what his position was he operated in that position to overcome no fear no doubt no not sit over comment we got this I'm a very prophesied and study you said he spoke the son of God yeah now brother branham told us in the fundamental foundation for faith and by the way it's a very difficult tape to listen to because the audio is very poor but it was one of my favorite sermons but he said man was made as a secondary god on the earth he was given the power to control all things all elements of the earth that was Adam Adam was given these great powers but then the power that he was given to make himself as where he failed Adam could speak to the winds and it would stop he could speak to the trees and they would obey him he could speak to light wildlife and it would obey him he can speak to the waters and for what it was everything obeyed Adam Adam never had to be sick he never had to die he never had a worry he'd never had he never had a fear he just climbed right up in the arms of the father just like a child and everything was his and whatever he asked why he just got it and everything obeyed him because he was God's child and the child is heir of all things that's how Adam operated but we know what happened God allowed the fall now he didn't make the fall but he made man where he could fall that he could make a choice this is because he was made in the image of God and in God's image you see if you would have been made like some of the Angels just say holy holy holy and that's all their job is is holy holy holy those angels perhaps never have a choice but you have a choice because you are made in the image of God and God didn't wants it now listen God didn't want some robot to serve Him holy holy holy holy God wanted men and women that would choose to worship Him their heart to say I love you Jesus hey mom I've said it before but to use their knowledge II again use the illustration you know it's kind of like if a boy had power over a girl you know that if you just had the power to Zephyr you know she don't like me so you don't love me but if I can just zap her I can make her let me and all of a sudden you zap that little girl and see going around I love you I love you I love you who wants a robot come on church who wants a robot who wants somebody did this is a mindless idiot following you around town saying what you wanted to say it would mean nothing it would have absolutely no meaning to you because you know it's the uniform power over to zapper and so she loves you and business mindlessly go along like an idiot or a robot said I love you I love me I love you I love you and you know if you ever let her loose she wouldn't love you she'd be right back in the same old condition are you with me my god didn't want you the robot he didn't want you going around saying I love you Jesus I love you Jesus I love you Jesus like a mindless idiot God wanted you to love him with all your heart with all your soul with all your being now then hey boy if you want to hurt to love you then you got a woo her hey man you got a woo her and this is what God did when you chose the wrong thing a life of sin and you kept choosing it god no no hallelujah path what he begin to woo you is what I'll do everything that I can I so love you [Music] [Applause] Oh for you I'll give my life for you take your purses I think your sin figure I'll take your future I put it all on me but your love hallelujah this is why that he said with Moses after he give them all those laws that sound and that sound not in that south-south nod and South and that's not not and after we gave all those laws because they want to know what can we do what is that we can do and then God said but what I want is not all your laws and you have to do this and you have to do that and have to do that I want you to love me all that a man would love me with all in hearts and with all his soul with everything that's within me so God allowed a fall now of course God knew the fall would take place before it happened he knew the moment that he created man and put him on this basis of choice that he would choose wrong he knew the deception would come but he didn't want that he didn't make that happen but before it ever happened before the sin ever took place he said I know they're going to do it so I'll be the savior I know they're gonna be sick so I'll be the healer I know they're gonna be in bondage so I'll be the deliverer so you see you know God allows men to fall and this beautiful picture that we have of a perfect eating no evil no thought no mortality no sin no death no sorrow it all gives way to a very marred picture and a broken life as Adam and Eve starts walking out crying hugging each other walking out of the garden why did we do this here's a bloody sheep skin flapping on their legs covering their nakedness God walk in the other direction with his back turned to hold man because of sin but God's love was so great that as he was walking away here and then commanded them to leave my leave this face of sonship leave this rice where you rule the supreme I can't let you rule there in your sin man get out of my garden go out the way and turns his back old man and begins to walk away but it all fell down to one thing [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] become a seed seed of the woman and I tell you what we gonna do Oh [Applause] you will tread on that you going I will be the seed of the woman that will come to redeem man from this decrepit condition hallelujah Nordic God feel like I could make a few laps around his building and speak in other tongues but you know through the fall man that lost conscience of the fact after loosing his relationship and friendship and fellowship with the father he lost that in his great all his great channels became clogged up and that fellowship between God and man was broken now what God what Adam was in God Christ has redeemed us back to that hey man I want to give you the good news we're on our road back hey man it starts with the soul it'll end with the body being redeemed fully redeemed now so you see a redeemer is to redeem on to redeem anything is to bring it back to its origin again and Adam the lost the very consciousness in other words he had lived in a perfect world before the fall but after the fall he lost consciousness awareness it was now hard for him they even believed he was there he had had amnesia he forgot he felt so far that he lost Dominion by giving up faith for Satan's wisdom and now he becomes himself a slave to sin and unbelief and that controls him the title deed to the earth and eternal life when Adam for you know satan's dirty hands couldn't take it God wasn't going to give it to him I might even though even though right now because of man's subjecting himself to Satan that Satan becomes the Prince of the power of the air that's not his position it doesn't belong to him now so the abstract title deeds eternal life goes back in the hand of the one who gave it which was Almighty God and it was waiting for redemption claims that brings it right down to our day do you believe that hey man you see what is it doing it's in the hands of God waiting for redemption claims he made a way Redemption he's made a way back and someday the Redeemer is to take it back now thinking that God became a man as he said I'll become the seed then we'll go with you hey man you remember that because this is where he said I'm gonna put enmity between thee and thy seed and the Serpent and his seed so we know the serpent had a seed the Bible said so remember I'm gonna put enmity between the two and this seed is going to be the seed that's going to come through a woman will bruise the head of the Serpent and in doing so you're the see because in doing so your heel or the seeds heel will be bruised in other words where he touches the earth in his humanity will be bruised for the sake of redemption amen so again in his in his treading on the serpent over sin he would be bruised he would be wounded for our transgression he would be bruised for our iniquity I mean the weapons we should have gone but come on him so that by his stripes we could be healed now think of it God becomes a man and and so yeah and and he continues you know at Calvary he begins his work of redemption by paying the price for man's sin I want to tell you the price is paid in full every one of you that have the Holy Ghost have a deposit of that what he did there all right now so again but where Christ is now claiming the book of title in order to give it back to man because man lost it man that God wants man to have it he wants you to have dominion and so he's given back to man poured out in the youth of faith can I say it this way the faith the consciousness of who you are in Christ now you know what you were as a sinner but what the devil want you to know is who you are in Christ and it's hard sometimes to fathom that you have that but God sent a prophet to wake up the consciousness and Here I am as a preacher standing here this morning saying you've got the power you are an overcomer and you are able hallelujah now when man became subject to sin and sorrow pain and death he became a puppet to everything the devil wanted him to do you all know that you everyone was his puppet so as I whatever string he pulled that's what you did that's right some of you still on that strength you need salvation hey man so you see he became a puppet now and only then when he became a puppet good was the spirit of cancer able to take a hold of him bring him to his crane only then could a demon feel his heart would plaque until it could beating why because unbelief gave Satan the power to prevail over man let's talk about unbelief for a man we're talking about faith we got to look at the being the counterpart or shall them to say the opposite side of the spectrum what the enemy has unbelief what comes to counter faith so unbeliever doubt can do a lot of things it can create an atmosphere in a meeting when everyone is staring with unbelief and whenever one body is looking and all them demons with her public power focus right on them and their unbelief unbelief is demon power I'm and so now if we think about that for a moment remember down at youth camp when we were dealing with some of them demon spirits someone we just had to pull out and in another room and man why because the enemy was congregating telling some of the young people I'll believe when they catch that Devil out I'll be a Christian if they can do it I'll tell you if they don't do it well I know this messaging to all these doubts oh did you see they they think they're big bunch of big shots that they got power to do they they're they can't do it oh poor soul he'll have to live with this demon all his life all of these stops now and the people are wondered do they have enough power are they able to conquer listen listen unbelief is the only thing that can keep you from the kingdom of God and the only thing that is saying the is unbelief I'm quoting from brother said he said brother branham nod quit drinking and I quit they're doing these things that my evil ways whoa well you did that for one purpose see the only thing that calls you to do that is because you become a believer then again he would say let me show you just on a word the first time that the never met Jesus Christ he doubted him that always is of the devil and that's where the for sin come there is no other sin but doubt unbelief is the original and only sin committing adultery is not a sin smokings not us and getting drunk another sin that is the attributes of unbelief Alleluia hey man now again we know those are attributes because you're an unbeliever you do those things now in the voice have gone in the last days let me share another sin is righteousness perverted a lie is a truth misrepresented adultery is an act that God ordained us to perverted all unbelief is a perversion of unbelief you have to deny the truth in order to take the perversion see straighten out these voices test them by the word see if it's the truth but look with me but in the phase we got today the best doctors we ever had and I want to say I thank God for the Advancement of science hey man I came to church today because of the advancement of science I rode in a car I thank God for what do they do in hospitals and doctors and whatever else the good that has done but it's off the tree of knowledge of good and evil but now we said we got the best hospitals we ever had we got the best drugs we ever practice with heavenly we got more sickness than we ever had haven't we because we got more on belief than we ever had haven't we and that's right you're exactly only God's the healer and we know that so faith is a channel those were in God works unbelief is the channel wherein Satan works so unbelief is the worst sin there he is and it's the only sinner he is and all the other sins are just an attribute said that unbelief now here's what the Bible said first John three and eight he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning he was the first doubter of God's Word he did it in heaven sin began in heaven not on earth when Lucifer exalted his own thoughts and wisdom above the Word of God and made angels doubted somebody with me and man say he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning but for this purpose the Son of God was manifested here's the reason the son of God was revealed here's why the seed promised to the woman was given and revealed are you in me that he might somebody help me preach it destroy the works of the devil hallelujah hey man so this is what he came to do destroy the works of the devil in your lives in my life and redemption came up with me fully had until all the works of the devil have been totally destroyed and you're not redeemed until that demon that you were born with is dead in your life that old man of sin that sin nature hey man that's why as I said it's not hard to be born again it's hard for people that die the sin nature to that first nature they were born with now so they see the heart has to be cleansed before God can come down in the person of the Holy Ghost which is Christ coming down and dwell in the human heart it must be for us to be repented it must be baptized in water in his name to show who it belongs to that's what we baptize in the name of Jesus Christ because we're identifying with him who we belong to taking on his name I meant that it must be cleansed by the blood of Jesus and then the holy fire and Holy Ghost from God comes down and burns out the desire of sin and I know cuz it happened to me a man that where you come down you you hate what God hates and then you love what God loves a man so notice and therefore he that sins willfully after receiving the knowledge of truth the Bible said if he knows the truth and he says willfully he needs to sacrifice cuz they don't have a sacrifice if you have the true sacrifice there's no sin can be attributed to you so there's no way for him to sin he that's born of God cannot sin he does not sin there's no way for him to sin how can be a sinner to redeemed that there's a damn how could I be an upon seven I the pancha at the same time oh he redeemed us by his blood by your spirit he cleanse us and then he comes to dwell in us the church not the denomination Downton's a church not the building we're sitting in the church the body of Jesus Christ now when you see that Baptists are the Holy Ghost here's what I want you to get we've been preaching about it you have the same God dwelling in you that created the heavens and the earth [Applause] hallelujah amen and with garden now listen let me go back with sin I believe comes its attributes with God comes those attributes with God comes Authority with God comes power with God's Dominion God God comes inside of you when the Spirit comes to dwell in you and it's impossible to have God and not have his attributes it is impossible to have God that Christ in you and not have his attributes a man not like brother Branham was often tell us he said you know if the spirit of both be Tobin came in me I'd write music if the spirit of Dillinger came in me I'd kill people but a spirit of Christ comes in me I'm gonna do what Christ did hey ma'am so it's impossible to have God and not have his attributes and so therefore I'm trying to tell you human power is already in you overcoming power already is in you the power of transformation is on the inside this morning works without faith none of it now brother Branham would say in the message faith if you're sick and not a Christian become a Christian right now so that healing power will come in you by becoming a Christian and that will give you faith to ride above sin it'll give you faith and everything you need up in this journey is right in you now and the only thing you have to do is have faith in God that pushes that good things out of you which is by which is in you by the Holy Spirit so you see again your own resurrection is hitting you right now Romans 8:11 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised Christ from the dead shall also quicken make alive your mortal body by his spirit that dwelleth in you so by the Holy Ghost in you resurrection power lays in you I'm out brother branham would say in this message faith he said now each one of you have the power the same way because your sons and daughters of God and their very spirit that's in you this morning the Holy Spirit that's in you this morning that same only spirit will raise you up so you have the power to raise yourself back up and Manny would tell us the rapture is in us now hallelujah by having the Holy Ghost the rapture is in me that's why I say freeze I'm not afraid of missing the rapture I am the rapture [Applause] I'm not afraid if you bury me in a graveyard I'm not afraid that I'm gonna lay there forever and ever ever because resurrection power lays within me quickening power is already these old bones those he just scald he justified those he justified he thought glorified that's the scripture for that then in heaven today we're glorified in the presence of God not right now I'm just pushing out to it amen glory God's in his word you believe it every present water from the rock he said the power that raised us up is in us right now and now we are now in heavenly places we are now in the power of the Resurrection if there wasn't a law to that oh now listen if there wasn't a law to that sons and daughters of God would create them the world out here and go live a private life on it you have the power in you to do it if you got a shadow of the power of God because it's not no weak spots in God or big heavy spots in God that are limited but but the least touch of God is omnipotent so you have the power in you to do it if you got a shadow of the power of God in you you got the power of God God is omnipotent so you what I mean the power that's in you with me you could speak a world into existence and go live on it hallelujah there you are that's what's power that's in the church now but it's controlled by law and that law is not keeping a bunch of Commandments it is a law of faith jesus said all things are possible to them that believe if you can believe it whatever God believes you're sold to believe that's your and the place the souls of your vision set upon by faith God gives it to you a man ensures you possess it if you can find this key to this law of faith and opens it to you see what I mean that power is controlled if you're son of God and you are a daughter until you're a daughter of God that never leaves you it's with you all the time but your faith gets away from it but it's still there the deepest Valley you go through cannot make you lose your sonship the hardest trial given to humanity cannot make you be lost [Music] hallelujah are you there is nothing can you hear me there is nothing that can separate you from the love of God in Christ Jesus nothing hallelujah hey man but your faith gets away from now he said sin doesn't mean to go out and drink and carry on go yeah go yeah and just believe no more there you are you know I find the greatest trouble with the Pentecostal church today is positionally they don't know who they are your sons and daughters of God a lot of times you're looking for something great to come but you already got it man the greatest thing that can be given to you what is that God's own the Holy Spirit and now we are the sons of God not we will be we are now and now we are seated and together in heavenly places right now in Christ Jesus when faith like that gets into church the devil moves away from the church we must be seeing some faith like that movement a man some people recognize and I understanding their position listen he goes him to say Satan hasn't got any illegal rights over a Christian you might as well tell the devil is Lord he no have any legal rights over my lights come on he has no legal rights over my health over my body over my joy over my peace he has no legal rights to take anything away I met Jesus is the one gave it to me and then a devil big enough that can take it away unless I give it over to it now every time a man gets saved how many saved this morning raise your hands high you're saved all right when do when a man gets saved then God writes out a whole big bunch of checks hey man hold a whole big bunch of checks like that [Music] here's your checkbook hey man and he puts his name at the bottom and says here they are [Applause] a man and brother man sons are you scared of it fill it out whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe you're receiving it shall be given to you mark 11:24 you just believe it now that's what Adam did before the fall he just took the check book of Dominion and he fill it out man that's what Jesus said when he says I give you the power over unclean spirits a man that's iets ever disease ever affliction ever devil you take any promise like a check a check isn't the money if a man is you a paycheck he didn't heed you the money it's the promise the money hey man but if you will endorse it the banker will honor it [Applause] according to his riches and glory [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] you said but how do I endorse it how in the world do I endorse it brother Tim you sign your name to it by confessing it when you sign your name on the back of the check you are again you are saying this is me and this is for me this is mine come on now it's all yours everything wrote on the check is yours but it's not yours until you sign your name to it by confessing it it's only your promise I've got checks though brother Tim I got my mom my mind look at all of these checks here there's check for my healing there's check for my delivers a check from the children there's a check wrote out from a wife and one from a husband and there's enough for ever need I got there's a check wrote out for it he'll bless me in the city and he'll bless me in the field and he'll bless the fruit of my womb and he'll bless hey man I got the chance but I'm just waiting on Jesus to come and sign my check no you're not Jesus already signed it with his bat and it's not erasable eek he can never take back his promise [Applause] change what's written on the check hallelujah it's rhythmically with his Brad change it change it David State [Applause] change [Applause] but the problem is the problem is were weaned on a special revelation that you call faith if I can just get you know faith as a revelation of the will of God well you're not waiting on that you've already got it if you just give me the faith I need a revelation in my healing so what do you need an angel come down from heaven smite you in the head hit you with the sword and say okay now now you know I'll give you this sign or I'll wait till you feel this goosebumps or some other vindication every one of you that are saved you raise your hands while ago and said you who are saying so how many I am of course we ask how many I'll not ask you again but when you receive that special there are when you receive that revelation of salvation that was a special revelation you have a personal revelation that you are saved [Music] amen and it was just like Peter when he got a revelation died to Christ the Son of the Living God he said now wait a minute placing blood didn't give this to you but my father which is in heaven he gave it to you and so therefore you have a special revelation a man that you are God's child you are his son or you're his daughter how many would agree with that this one I am his son or I'm his daughter hey man so I am saved hallelujah I am delivered I'm healed did hear the song I blame us a melon save us there's no shame on me [Applause] [Music] hallelujah I am delivered amens I've already received my special revelation hey man my special revelation is I am redeemed Jesus died for me he gave me his Holy Spirit I am his blood wash but Bob son or daughter of the Living God that's who I am hallelujah but what is included in redemption now let's talk about this for a moment because we say we're redeemed but what is it we mean what is it we have what are the benefits you know he would say in and sums the middle chapter of the Bible and he would say um lets the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits you see there are benefits of redemption if you go with me and into Matthew Hayden verse 16 when evening was come that brought to him many that was possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits didn't bother hear that ain't said it yet but did you read it he cast out the spirits with his word having Adam control his word is that right he's felt and it happened when was the sweat of his brow and Jesus a second Adam he casts out spirits with his well guess what that means me and you ain't gonna have to extract him like a tooth man we're gonna use the word because God's words gonna become our words and when we speak his words it has power because the word will defeat the devil anyplace anywhere anytime that's why you gotta get in love with your Bible because it's God's love letter to you and it's your checkbook and you ain't wrote out enough checks yet hey man and he cast out spirits with his word and he healed all that was sick then it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying himself took our infirmities and bare our sickness now this comes from the from Isaiah 53 verse 4 and we're going to look at that for a moment because you know brother Joe is telling me of a friend he's a pastor friend and a great man nice very nice man he believes that God it can heal but not that he will heal because he does not believe that healing was paid for at Calvary now those are underprivileged children and man they're not living at they're living below their privilege but let's just read it of course the Bible said I want you to go back to Matthew 8:16 for a moment those that were possessed with devil he cast out the spirits he healed all that was sick that it might be fulfilled in other words this would be the fulfillment of what Jesus came to do this seed that would come to bruise the head of the serpent then it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying he took our firm ''tis and bare our sicknesses on your day there and again the denominational world says see it's for sin that he healed a son not from sickness but jesus said that he bear our sickness that he might fulfill a man and it wouldn't be fully fulfilled until Calvary on the cross that he would carry our sickness and bare our infirmities are you with me now let's go to Isaiah 53 and verse 4 I love to give the devil a black eye I mean surely he had borne our grease oh man that is from the word kohli in the greek coming in the Hebrews and that word means sickness so surely he had borne our sickness what and carried our sorrows and that is from the Hebrew word Maccabi which means pain both middle pain and physical pain yet we did esteem him stricken stricken and smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions hallelujah and it was bruised that when we did things that we knew better than to do and we did it many how what didn't you he was bruised for our iniquity and the chastisement which means the weapons we should have got he took them for us they were taken upon him so we could have peace not shouting grounds right there and with His stripes we are healed now the denominational world means that mean they think that means say that in other words are our soul was saved but that's not what it means it comes from the word Arafah which means to heal to make helpful a man so by His stripes we were Bharata which is we are healed this is why he called himself Jehovah Rapha I will put none of these diseases upon thee which I brought upon the Egyptians for I am the lord that healeth thee I am Jehovah Rapha I am Jehovah the healer hallelujah so if he bore them then why do you have to America [Applause] hallelujah hey man you you say why he's got a right to attack that body because of mortality but you have got a right to cast him out of the Commission the Commission can make a sick McCall's of immortality because man sinned at the beginning but they called Jesus redeem it but the curse of the law and we killed Romans Aiden - are you getting tired well good because this is your Thanksgiving dinner and there's a lot to it then where's my water to get it down with alright Romans Aiden - are you with me you ready for this a man for the law of the spirit of life let me stop for a minute while I'm getting this water last week I left my mouth and I got a thread on my chin it brought a lot of entertainment to you and that's all you could think about what's this pretty entertaining wasn't it you all watched alright now let's go back to preaching again don't have a thread to entertain you but look at this Romans 8 and do far the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death somebody help me let's read this together everybody class participation wake up your neighbor and tell them we're reading something hey man for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus have made me free from the law of sin and death you know wake up your neighbor and tell them we're reading something and let's try it again for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death are you free hallelujah free I don't have to see a man I am not sacred slave I am free and easy I was asleep and he told me what to do but in this land that the Holy Ghost he's my sleep [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] further instruction from you hey math God wanted to be sure that you have the victory so he gave us his own spirit and every attribute of his spirit to dwell in us you have his spirit in what is yet an earthen vessel if you live with me and second Corinthians four and seven because you see then this is what Satan can't figure out because he know we got this body of ours by him perverting the word right hey man so because of that he's kinda he thinks he has us he has a sense of ownership but I wanted to show you this morning what the Bible said we have this treasure this Holy Spirit in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us so God wanted to show it wasn't Adam it was him men say let's have him fall and then he redeems us the sons of that to show to the devil it never was Adam it was me it was me it was my word that was ruling it was my truth that was for Baylin it was my faith I gave to him Adam did it all by me by my face what's now so he made this this treasure give we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God not of us so this treasure makes the excellency of the power to be of God it is not the vessel of Earth or this flash it's the treasure that is in us now so I am weak because of the earthen vessel and yet I'm strong because of the treasure I'm limited bound in a body of time and yet I have no limitations because I am eternal I am defeated as a human being and yet I overcome as a son of God and I know no defeat I have answered pains and you know cause we don't lose our humanity we go through discouragement we got times through times of being perplex we have a sit in a sticky carnal nature you know that hey man I won't talk about you I'll just talk about me hey man you know the earthen vessel it don't look like much it's short it's not handsome it's getting older every day and it's deuce the hair is thinning and getting gray it's an earthen vessel but then desorden vessel I have a treasure I have been recreated then did you give that I have been recreated and this time the spirit that I should have had at the beginning originally I'm not having me and it is the mystery that the devil don't understand a man and that is its Christ in you the hope of glory and though this Howard man Paris's inward man is renewed perpetually day by day every Holy Ghost filled individual has the law of the spirit of life within them and that's been the spirit is God himself that means deity lives on the inside of you it's our treasure come on somebody help me preach I'm at Galatians 2:20 he would say Christ liveth in me and I live by the faith of the Son of God so you see I'm dead yeah I'm crucified with Christ yet I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me hallelujah I'm putting the devil old notice because now when he meets me he's going to know a man there's a Christ living in me amen a greater is He that is in me then this one out here in the world man Ephesians 3:16 that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened by with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that's who the Holy Spirit is it's Christ the Spirit of Jesus amen devil I may not look like much but in spirit of Jesus dwelling by faith don't mean you're imagining him there but your faith declares he's there and your faith is a greater sense then even your eyesight you smelled your feel your touch and that's usually how I know I know this water is here because I see it and then I feel it and I taste it you don't have much smell and I can't hear it till it goes down but that's how I know it's there but how I know this is there is my greater sense and it's called faith faith I met him and he gave me a commission Colossians 1:27 to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory hey man that is our only hope of having victory over the devil sin and unbelief the glory of this mystery that God wants the Gentiles to know that you that are born again have Christ living in you now again I'm gonna go through this very quickly in Colossians 3 & 4 when Christ who is our life Christ is our life 1st Corinthians 1:26 I got to take a little time on listen sorry I was going to go all sober go up 1st Corinthians 1:26 for you see call it brother have not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many mobile noble are called a man let me give you another translation brother sisters consider who you were when God called you to salvation not many of you were wise scholars by human standards not many were you in positions of power not many of you were considered to be the elite when you answered God's call amen but verse 27 said but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God has chosen the weak things of the world can find the things that are mighty so God chose you let me give you that translation again God chose those who the world's consume for your foolish to shame those who think their wise and God chose the puny and the powerless to shame the high and mighty amen verse 28 and base things of the world and the things which are despised hath God chosen yay then things which are not to bring to nought things that are in other words he chose the lowly the laughable the despised the outcasts all of this is in the world's eyes the nobodies so that he can take you and make you something that would shame the somebodies he chose what is regarded as insignificant to supersede what is regarded as prominent know what that know could glory in his presence so that there would be no place for pride for both stand in God's presence but of him are ye in Christ Jesus who is who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption and so what we have comes from Christ who is in us and he is our god-given wisdom a man our virtue our holiness and I redemption a man and this fulfills what is written if any one boosts let him only boots and all that the Lord has done amen here's what's written Jeremiah 924 but let him the glory glory of glory in this and he that understandeth and knoweth me that he that understands the know me that i am the lord which exercised loving kind and judgment and righteousness near for in these things i delight saith the lord that's the Old Testament but in the New Testament we don't just boast and that we understand and know God but we both in that God is in us hallelujah and so because he dwells in us we can exercise true loving-kindness true gentleman and true righteousness and my doing so delight the Lord oh you don't know what you have in these earthen vessels a man it's a power that a quick in your mortal body the spirit of life is a quickening spirit a man the world is quickened on the inside of you and that word is a predestinated see that God placed in you before the foundation of the world are you with me you are not predestinated to be a sinner did he by human don't hang up yet he you are not predestinated to be a sinner you were allowed to be but you were not predestinated to me the woman of the law was not predestinated to be a prostitute Amen and neither were you predestiny to be a lukewarm lick believer man you are not predestinated to be sick or crippled a [Music] mad God foreknew it he knew what would happen to you but he didn't predestinate you to be that way that is not your destiny the God made come on somebody help me amen where were you predestinated me you were predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son do you believe that hey man that's what you were predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son the spirit of life once in G works in you according to the law of faith and faith is Allah all things are possible to them that believe a man it's a law faces of law that Jesus that God himself uses a man by faith God created the world the Bible said in Hebrews 11:3 but faith that we understand that the world was the world's was framed by the Word of God he created the molecules dadums all by faith he created the world on this this son but faith faith is a law by which he controls everything God could not have created anything without faith a man powers and attributes and authority was already there but there's nothing that says that God that was created or God without to add anything to him a man he says I'm the Lord and I changed not he said in me there's no variableness north's shadow returning he cannot change a man he cannot take away from himself it was already in him to be a healer a savior a redeemer of creator of father but all of it would have been useless without faith I'll tell you God does everything himself by faith a man faith had to be never before anything can be created he's being a creator had to work according to his own law of faith in order for there to be a creation there could be no lamb slain before the foundation world unless he had faith a man there would not be a people whose name was in the book of life unless he had faith a man a man jesus knew it was not his earthen vessel that was doing the work yet he was the Virgin born and without sin but even said he said in John 14 10 believe it's not that I'm in the father and the father me and the words I speaking to you I speak not I myself but the father dwelleth in me he doeth the what man so jesus knew he was not his roots and vessel you are looking at yours and vessel and you said I can't do this and Jesus could look at his own earthen vessel he said I cannot my own self I cannot do this [Applause] look at Jesus there and that gatherer with all them Devils would come there and look at it and look at me sighs how did you get in there I see more oh man the spies behind those eyes Jesus they would take and take dominion over legions not one legions millions of Devils at one time somebody help me preach why the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in him hello somebody amen but if you just got a little bit of God in you by the Holy Ghost there's enough power in there to make a world a man the disciples were given power to heal the sick cast out devils they met a they met a devil they couldn't cast out because Christ was only walking with him then he wasn't living in them and only when he came walking up did the devil have to leave are you with me but Jesus had faith and what he said would happen Jesus not only had power because he was the word he had faith with his power Jesus relied on no and he wants the word a man in other words he understood his origin he understood his birth what I'm trying to get you to do is understand your birth a man you can only have faith when you understand your origin and when you understand your birth that you are the word that your is offspring that you are the scripture made manifest or made flesh are you with me now we're born again Peter said not a corruptible seed but of the Word of God we have been born of the word so we are born of the logos hallelujah the locals gave birth to another logos the word gave birth to another word a man and every son of God our God is the thought of God Express which is the Word of God are you with me you are the word this is why would say in read revelation 19 you are the true sayings of God a man that we are the one called to the marriage supper the lamb the logos the true sayings and then you're a word bride I'm coming down to the end so hang on tight we're gonna come in for a fast landing now listen amendments you don't understand your position this is the problem today it's not a position you earned a man it's not a position or that you you work for it is position given to you by redemption a man and it was his own blood that was paid and I ask you what's it enough is it enough it's a lamb worthy is the lamb worthy is it sufficient now that therefore then because of you were born of him the old man but you understand this birth but you into righteousness you can speak that means you can prophesy not sons and daughters shall prophesy and prophesy again o son of man can these bones live prophesy Son of Man [Applause] speak the word to it as your own hallelujah Jesus he relied in knowing he wants the word I'm trying to get you to rely on your new birth now a man you have faith in God who made you the word come on church if you're born of God don't skip birth the dogs cats give birth to cats come on somebody but when God gives birth he gives birth to gods and now you are the sons of God you're the offspring of Almighty God by the new birth a man therefore you are given a position but do you understand your position Jesus took his position because of what the word said not because he felt goosebumps not because somebody ran the aisle not because somebody else profess to believe it Jesus looked in the word and he said it's written at me thou shall not leave his soul in hell he didn't say Jesus but Jesus says own name there that's I'm not leaving soul in Hell neither shall the Holy One see corruption you say Jesus use that word all that Noah did there's a Holy One in this they called the product price hallelujah amen and he will not leave us in this hell of the oldest eeeh and this evilly neither will he allow this body to be corrupted by Satan said Billy healed of three different Gavilan hell he'll bankrupt all of heaven to see that this bride makes it I'm talking about a mighty God today amen jesus knew whether he was old not transfiguration or whether he was in the wilderness a temptation or if he was on a boat about to be sunk or if he was standing before a million demons and a man jesus knew who he was he knew it because of what God said he said that they filled him with the Holy Ghost a man he said this day I have begotten you a man the Spirit of God came over him is that right and then said this is my beloved son and whom I please said well in you say brother Tim I wish I had that experience every Holy Ghost filled person has that experience I might have an open spirit that sins upon the son or daughter of God that is repeated you may not have seen the light you may not have heard the voice but you know something happened there was a down came down on the inside of you like you are different your life it's changed you're a new creature in Christ Jesus you're not the same old man you were [Applause] now Jesus is now living not an albums body not in the second Adams body but Jesus has come down and took over the perverted body you got from your first birth that Satan got ahold of your soil and corrupted it and finding it and defiled it go back and look at him there he was from the hand that God created and now Satan comes to live and now that body is anybody with me now that body that used to praise God they used to fellowship they used to speak in control atmosphere now becomes possessed by sin by Satan by the serpent and now he's defeated and now these hands that used to praise God hung down these feet that used to walk in his paths walking wrong paths his body becomes members of the Spirit that dwells in him but God pulled a fast one on the devil he said what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take bodies that used to serve sin mouse they used to speak loss they used to entertain every evil thought them speak them hands they used to be quick to shed blood I'm gonna change that body [Music] [Applause] [Applause] hallelujah and it's not gonna be like and even without a path on in his mind without a pass but it's gonna be different from that it'll be those with a pass and these companies suing this lady's thought up anytime it kind of make you feel unclean any friends you down you won't give you keep speaking the word you keep speaking the word speaking the word [Applause] and he takes this body that was a Siena Mexico read by God and say I love you Jesus I love you Jesus I love you Jesus and this is the victory that overcometh our the world even I say stand together worship God with me this morning [Applause] I can't make them stop [Music] it desires and they won't give you a man to keep underwear to preeminence that's what makes God smile that delights is heart you see Satan redemption undos everything says what nurse said I heal them when they're lost I savor when they die and I just take them into another dimension with a healed body they can't be defeated faith is the victory that overcometh the world aren't you glad for that victory hallelujah can't we rely then on what God has done for us now brother Branham said don't throw it don't don't don't shoot a 22 rifle at him he said you see you get an atomic bomb we get the job done that's faith in his word blast him away you can bless him go away time after time after time and I don't care what he's throwing at you today I'm telling you you're the winner I'm telling you you can't love God that is in Christ Jesus faith is a conquer is an overcomer it's the victory that overcomes the world hallelujah the conquer means to beat down to override the handcuff to throw into prisons it means a sin that once rules you you rule it now hallelujah [Music] you've whipped it it's over comes [Music] if it buffets again and again and again you stand right there in the face of it I believe that's who I am I won't ever doubt I'll stand on the promise I'll not give place to the devil that's what the Bible said don't give place to the devil don't give him any place well he's come down he's touchy with the complex don't give place to him take the sword of the word and run him off Egyptians don't belong in this land Darin that the in the sin I was his
