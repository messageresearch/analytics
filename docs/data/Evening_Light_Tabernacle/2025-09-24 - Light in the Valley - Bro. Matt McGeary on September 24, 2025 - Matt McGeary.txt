Just ask the Lord to come and minister to your heart and to your need. We have brother Matt McGiri with us this evening. Him and his family are here with us. And uh Matt is no stranger to us. I believe he's a God- called man anointed for this hour to preach this message. and you got a need. I believe that you can pull from the minister exactly what you have need of, pull them to your need. I just believe he studied and prepared and we just do our part and present our need to Christ and he will in turn use the man of God to direct that. So, let's just go to him in prayer this evening. Father, Lord, we're so thankful we can come in your house in your presence, Lord. Lord, knowing that not only were two or three be gathered, Lord, that's just not a cliche for believers, but Lord, we're gathered not only in this house, but we're gathered in your presence. We're gathered in your name, Lord. And your name is a name that's lifted high and above every other name. Lord, you would tell us even at the mention of that name, every knee shall bow, Lord. Every tongue will confess that thou art the Christ, the son of the living God. And Lord, we just exalt you tonight, Lord. You're the master of the winds, Lord. You're the Lord. You're the one who formed and fashioned our bodies, Father, before the foundation of the world, Lord. You place within us a desire to serve you. And tonight, Father, we just come to give back, Lord. Just what little bit of little bit of worship and praise tonight, God, not only in our singing, but Lord, as we respond to the word, we invite you, God, to come and open the windows of heaven, Lord, and pour out your blessings to us, Lord. You see the hands that were lifted, needs representative. God, I ask that you would come and just minister to those needs tonight. Lord, would you see the visitors in our midst, Lord, may you speak to them, Lord. May they see a living God, Lord. Not some God of man, not some God of some psychology, but may they see the living God displayed before them today, Lord. And they can say like the woman at the well, "Come see a man who's told me all that I've done." So, Father, we just come before you tonight. I pray you'll use a man of God. May you'll just anoint his lips, Lord, to speak the words of life. Father, anoint our hearts that we may receive and our ears to hear and to rightly divide the word. Lord, we pray. We just thank you for it. Now, bless bless this service, Lord. May you just have your way tonight. Father, be with our pastor and Lord, brother Timothy and brother Aaron as they're gone traveling this week to minister there in Canada. But may you use him in a special way. Father, we just commit it to you now in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] Amen. The brothers can take up the offering this evening. I stand in all within the presence of the Lord. In whom the wisdom of the ages lies. In whom the raging of the sea subsides, the living sacrifice, my only source of life, my hope is in the Lord. Oh, from this time on and ever more. Oh, my hope is in the Lord forever. We'll say it again. My hope, my hope is in the Lord. Oh, from this time on and ever more. Oh, my hope is in the Lord forever more. His tender mercies come with every rising sun. to lead the sinner in his brokenness to offer healing and forgiveness. And those ones who trust they will find their hearts at rest. My hope is in the Lord. Oh, from this time on, oh my hope is in the Lord. Oh, forever more. Yes, my home is in the Lord from this time on and more. And oh, my hope is in. Yes. Forever more. And I'm going to see a victory. I'm going to see a victory for the battle belongs to you, Lord. Oh, I'm going to see a victory. I'm going to see a victory for the battle belongs to you, Lord. And there's power in the mighty name of Jesus. And every war he wages, he will win. Oh, I'm not backing down from any giants because I know how this story ends. Oh, I know how this story ends. And I'm going to see a victory. I'm going to see. Sister Zoe, sister, you bring your special belongs to you, Lord. Oh, I'm going to see a victory. I'm going to see a victory. The battle belongs to you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, the battle belongs to you, Lord. Amen. You can be seated for a moment. [Music] Every battle that I've had to face led me right back to your amazing grace. Even in trles, I knew that I would be You were my shelter in the weight of the storm. The wind shook my heart till you brought me to shore. Now I am in all of the way that your love takes home. I've seen a light shining in the darkest of places. I've seen your heart loving, embracing and chasing the lost and the lonely, the hopeless, the broken in me. And that's why I believe. [Music] Thought I was falling, that it was the end. But you were beneath me with your steady hand. You keep showing up again and again and again. [Music] With wings like eagles, you've helped me to soar. You brought me to heights like never before. And you never grow weary of showing me so much more. I've seen light shining in the darkest of places. I've seen your heart loving, embracing and chasing the lost and the lonely, the hopeless, the broken in me. And that's why I believe. [Music] Blessed are those who have not seen but believe. And even when I couldn't see, you were blessing me. And even when I couldn't believe you were holding me, you were holding me. You're still holding me. I've seen light shining in the darkest of places. I've seen your heart loving, embracing and chasing the lost and the lonely, the hopeless, the broken in me. And that's why I believe. Oh, that's why I believe you'll never stop loving me. That's why I believe [Music] [Applause] Amen. [Music] Amen. Can you just say that tonight that I'll never stop loving him. Amen. As the choir makes their way, just sing this chorus. You're such an awesome God. So mighty, so holy, so wonderful, [Music] such an awesome God, so selfless, so generous, so faithful you You're such an awesome God. So mighty, so holy, [Music] so wonderful. Such an awesome God. So selfless, so generous, so faithful you are. Sing it again. Such an awesome God, so mighty, so holy, [Music] so wonderful. Such an awesome God. So selfless, so generous, so faithful you are. You're such a God. [Music] When my heart is broken, when my life is empty, I can't see your face. I can't hear your voice. When I'm feeling helpless, wondering in the darkness, surrounded by fear and defeat, I have a choice to make. No matter what comes my way, I choose to worship. I choose to race. I choose to lift up the name above all names. I choose surrender. I choose to believe for all that you've done and for all you will be. I choose to worship. [Music] Even in the fire, even in the valley, I can have joy and I can have peace. And you are always with me and you never will forsake me. Your presence is all that I need. I have a choice to make. With all that I am, I proclaim. I choose to worship. I choose to praise. I choose to lift up the name above all names. I choose surrender. I choose to believe for all that you've done and for all you will be. I choose to worship. [Music] Though we are present on every side, praise is our weapon and we'll win this fight. We made our choice our voice. Let the church rise up and say, "Oh, we will sing. We choose to worship. We choose to praise. We choose to lift up the above. [Music] We choose surrender. We choose to believe. for all that you've done and for all you will be. We choose to worship. We choose to praise. We choose to lift up your name above all names. We choose surrender. We choose to believe for all that you've done and for all you will be. We choose to worship. &gt;&gt; We choose to worship you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We choose to worship. &gt;&gt; We choose to worship. I choose. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can we just all stand together? Amen. And as we worship his name, turn over over the order of the service. Amen. Amen. Why don't you just take a moment to lift your hands to him? Tell him, "I choose to worship you, Lord." Amen. Let's just take a moment and say, "I worship you, Almighty God. There is none like you. [Music] I worship you, oh prince of peace. That is what I long to do. I give you praise for you are my rightousness. I worship you almighty God. There is none. Oh, just tell them one more time. I choose to worship. I worship you all night. &gt;&gt; For there is none [Music] like you, oh my word. Oh prince of peace. &gt;&gt; That is what I long. [Music] &gt;&gt; Say I give you praise. Oh for you are my rightousness. And I worship you, almighty God. There is none like you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you testify to that &gt;&gt; this evening? There's none like him. &gt;&gt; There's none greater. There's none higher. There's no one that can help you like the Lord Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; And you know, if you've lived on this side long enough, you're going to get into a place where you need more than a man. &gt;&gt; You need more than mommy or daddy. You need more than somebody that can do something in a natural way. You need something supernatural. &gt;&gt; You need the King of Kings. You need the Lord of Lords. You you need a God that can do the impossible to come on the scene. And &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Maybe as we would go to the Lord in prayer, as maybe somebody wants to lift a hand up and say, "Lord, I I need you to speak to me tonight." And for my my situation, my family, my life, and amen, God bless you, Lord Jesus. We've just humbly approach you tonight, Lord, depending once again upon your grace and your mercy, but your Holy Spirit would just come and pick up a man that would be unworthy to stand here, Lord. But it's only because of your grace and your mercy that would reach down into the muck and mire and you would lift me up out of the chaos, out of the darkness, confusion in the light of this glorious gospel would shine into my soul and quickening me to life to start to manifest that gene attribute that you placed here in this time. And how I love you, Lord. I thank you, Lord, that you would look upon me in my time of need. And you would provide and do it exceedingly and abundantly above all that I could ever think or ask, Lord. So now, Lord, as I stand before the redeemed, the purchased elect of Lord, I ask that you'd come in a supernatural way and just take your word and break it, Lord, and distribute it to the hungry hearts. Lord, maybe there's somebody here that don't know you. Maybe they know of you or they know so much, but Lord, I pray you'd come in a special way and minister to their heart. We love you, Lord. Just pray that you be with brother Tim and the ministry that is away, Lord, and the service they'll be taking for the gallant soldier, Brother Ed, that you've taken home, Lord, to his reward. On this side, our hearts would be heavy. But oh Lord, he he fought a good fight and he finished the course and has entered into the glories of heaven. Now Lord, we want to run and we want to be faithful. So we just commit all these things into thy loving hands. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. If you have your Bibles, let's just turn into Psalms 23. Amen. It's always good to be gathered here with you. We certainly love you and hold you dear to our heart. And uh so many friends here. And I just want to say it's a privilege to uh uh stand here. And uh as brother Tim asked us just to come and put our shoulder to the wheel. Brother Tim uh means so much to me. I couldn't say enough and each one of you. So, we're just glad to be here. Are you Are you happy to be in church? &gt;&gt; Things might look a little different. You know, you might have to sit somewhere else and look a different way, but you know, we didn't come to just see, man. We come to see the Lord Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. So, &gt;&gt; are y'all ready for the word? &gt;&gt; Just appreciate all the song specials and everything. Uh we bring you greetings from uh our church, Christian Life Tabernacle, and just happy to be here. Psalms 23 and4. Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil. My cup runth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. You may have your seats. If you'll also just turn with me to Isaiah 60. Very familiar scripture reading here. Isaiah 60 verse one. Everybody make it? &gt;&gt; All right. It says, "Arise, shine, for the light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people, but the Lord shall rise upon thee." I like that. That's personal now. The Lord shall rise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee. Amen. I just want to read this quote. Brother Brandham says uh referring to Psalms 23, he says, "There has to be enough light to make a shadow." Right? So, we're referring now to Psalms 23, he said where David's saying, "Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil." And the prophet of God says, "There has to be enough light to make a shadow." If it was dark in here, my shadow would not be on this pulpit. But being that there's light, then it makes a shadow. See? So, so death is dark in a certain way, but it's only a shadow. See, the valley of the shadow of death. So, there has to be a certain amount of light in death to make it a shadow. Aren't you happy that so that there is light in the valley? You know, I just want to say we we go through seasons. We go through hard times and good times and dry times. We have mountain tops and we have valleys. But I want to say, aren't you happy that even though you're in the valley, there's light. And that's why we'd want to minister to you a little uh this evening on light in the valley. And you know, the valley isn't always a a fun place to be. You know, there's tribulations and trials and there's there's tests and things that we go through. And you know, we sing that song, you know, uh uh uh uh uh you know, uh you want to be like Jesus. On earth, may I be like him. And and that's our heart's desire. But then when you read in the scripture, it says he was a man of sorrow, a man of grief and agony and say, "Well, you know, may I want to be like him, but I don't want the grief. I don't want the agony. I I don't want to go through those times." But, you know, uh that's the way of a Christian many times. It's a way of grief and agony and sorrow. And I just believe God wants to speak to somebody uh a very personal this evening. you know, a certain one place, Brother Brandon would say, you know, we put a lot on the mountaintop experiences, but not so much down in the valley of decision where where there got to be a digging out and we got to get things out of our life and out of our way and and and have prayer meetings and, you know, uh many times that's that's uh we we we forget that the way of a Christians, it's rugged. It's it's hard. It's It's not always just uh fun and prosperity and and everything's good, but but no, there's agony and there's grief and and and it's hard. It can be a time of testing as as the scripture would say in Revelations 3:21. It say to him that overcomemeth, &gt;&gt; well, then you got to have something to overcome. &gt;&gt; You know, as the prophet says, he's not just going to push you through a pipe and and pull you out on the other side and say, "Well done, my my good and faithful service. if you didn't have nothing to overcome. &gt;&gt; But you're going to have something to overcome. Each one of you have something to overcome. You're going to when you when you come to the Lord and you're born again and filled with the Holy Ghost, that ain't the end. That's just the beginning. &gt;&gt; You're going to have some hard tests, some hard trials. You're going to have to go through some mountain tops and some valleys and go through some hard experiences. That's right. &gt;&gt; To him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne. Brother Brandon was saying how can I overcome? He said the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you. &gt;&gt; Hey, that's a hard one there. &gt;&gt; You know you mean you mean you wait a second now, brother Brandon. I thought when when I was born again and filled with the Holy Ghost and a and the burden of sin was lifted off of me and I felt so free. I I could just rejoice. I could scream. I I could shout. I could run. I mean, Brother Brandon, that was the greatest thing that ever happened to me. Well, I'll give you that. But now the prophet's coming and saying, "But the test is the greatest thing that you know, the only thing you take with you to heaven is your character." &gt;&gt; And and how do you get character? Character is a victory. And if you're going to have a victory, you're going to have to have a &gt;&gt; you're going to have to have a test. &gt;&gt; I think it's time that we start embracing that we got to have some test. We got to have some trials that that way when they show up on your door and they're knocking, you're not running and wondering, "Well, what did I do wrong, brother Joe? What what what happened? Did I did I make a misstep? Did I do that?" No, it's a test. &gt;&gt; It's the greatest thing that ever happened to you. I believe it's written in the scriptures. Peter said that, "Oh, our trials are worth more to us than precious gold." &gt;&gt; It's a testing time. It's a good evidence to us that God is with us when we're tested. For all children of God are tested and they're tried. Has anybody ever gone through a trial? &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm preaching to some Christians tonight. &gt;&gt; Has anybody ever gone through a dark valley? &gt;&gt; Maybe, maybe somebody here right now, you're in a dark valley. Maybe it's agony and it's grieving. I believe God is wanting to speak to somebody tonight. Because we go through hard times. We go through trials. We go through times when we we don't know whether to turn left or right. We can't see the future. We ain't got no vision. We don't know where to turn. We're wondering why is it so hard. It looks like everybody else has it easy. And and this person gets blessed and that person gets blessed and I'm working a 9 to5 at Taco Bell and it seems like I can never get out of the rat hole in mind and and it just seems like I can never advance in life. Oh, I want to tell you friend, don't look at earthly pleasures. Don't look at at your apartment. Don't look at your car. Don't look things of this world to measure God's prosperity in life. I want to tell you if you've got a revelation that Malachi 4:5 is a vindicated prophet to lead you into a body change, I say you are blessed. You are blessed beyond measure. &gt;&gt; But you might be going through a hard time. You might be going through a trial. You might be wondering, "Why has this all befallen me?" &gt;&gt; Well, maybe it's the greatest thing that ever happened to you. I'm going to tell you, some of you young people, you go to camp and you have a real born again, Holy Ghost filled experience with God and you get the Holy Ghost and you come home and some of those things that you were fighting and battling, they show up knocking on your door. Yes, you might fall to it, but I want to tell you the difference is is you get back up. &gt;&gt; Don't be surprised when the devil comes trying to tempt you. &gt;&gt; The test is a testing time. It's the greatest thing that ever happened to you because you know what it teaches you, man, I there's some more growing. I got to do &gt;&gt; you know and don't let devil rob you of your experience but what happens is a lot of times the test comes and maybe you fall but you know what you get back up say Lord I I want to be right I want to be prayed up cuz next time that thing comes around I want to get the victory &gt;&gt; because what is it doing it's molding you it's shaping you it's building character you're building up into the stature of a perfect man &gt;&gt; so we go through those trials and those hard places doesn't mean God's not with you That's right. &gt;&gt; Matter of fact, a vindicated prophet told me it's one good evidence, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That God is with you. &gt;&gt; Oh, now I I want to I want to talk like that. I don't want to talk use the devil's language. Oh, well, I'm going through a hard time because, you know, I I messed up and maybe I don't have what I thought I had and and maybe that's just everybody else and I'm foolish virgin and I maybe I better start handing out bottles of water and cups of water because at least there will be grace for me. Quit talking like that. You are the bride. &gt;&gt; You are going in a rapture. &gt;&gt; And it's about time you recognize if you're in a valley in a hard time. I ain't saying you you got to be jumping up and down. But I want to say there's peace in the valley. &gt;&gt; There can be joy in the valley. &gt;&gt; In your agony, in your grief, there can be peace. &gt;&gt; A peace that passes understanding. And I want to say you can sit there like Job and say, "Though he slay me, yet I trust him." Amen. &gt;&gt; And you can say the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to me. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me tonight? &gt;&gt; I just want to encourage you. May maybe maybe this is maybe this is the great shepherd leaving the 99 for the one. So, let's just maybe all get put our shoulder to the will of God speaking to one &gt;&gt; God coming to you and letting you know that that maybe it does look hopeless to you and maybe you're getting down to the end of the line. You know, God uh you can look into the Bible and see many uh uh stories where it looks like they got down to the end of the line and God wants it to get that way where you can no longer depend on your ability. You can no longer depend on man. Where you finally look up and say, "Lord, I got no other option." Amen. &gt;&gt; I got no other way. The doctors have given up. Uh my friends have given up. And Lord, I even I've given up now. I need you to come on the scene. &gt;&gt; You look pretty hopeless for them Hebrew children. &gt;&gt; You know, they had gotten to a place where they said, "Look, I'm not going to bend. I'm not going to bow. You know, you you can make your laws and your creeds and your dogmas and and tell, but I'm going to stay true to the word." They said, "All right, we got to throw you in the fiery furnace." Well, they it looked like they were getting down to the end of the road. &gt;&gt; Looks like we're going to have to die for the cause. And you know, Brother Brandon would so beautifully uh dramatized where Wormwood would come and say, "Lord, I I'll go down. Let me go down the I'll wash and I'll set him free right now. I'll pour out the water. I'll do whatever I have to. I'll put out the fiery furnace." &gt;&gt; And maybe uh Michael was standing and say, "Well, Lord, I I I'll go right now. I I'll set the thing straight. I'll deliver your children. They stood for you. my house stand for them, Lord. Let me go. And God just sat back and said, "No, no, I don't want any of you to go &gt;&gt; because I'm going to go myself." &gt;&gt; And there the great creator, Jehovah, you know, he gr he he just blew out some wind and said, "Come from the east and come from the west." He grabbed a few lightning bolts and there he fleshed on down. And what was it? There was a fourth man in the fire. I want to tell you, you might be in a fiery furnace right now. You might be going through a deep dark trial and it might look hopeless. Want to tell you that Jesus Christ is here for you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; James would say in chapter 1 and verse three, knowing this, that the trying of your faith workketh patience. &gt;&gt; Well, let patience have her perfect work that you might be perfect and entire wanting nothing. I mean, how many times have you had some really good church services, some really good meetings, and man, you're just testifying about I believe I'm healed. &gt;&gt; I I I believe God's word and and my I'm just standing upon the uh the promise of God's word and and you're testifying and everything and oh, you're feeling so good. Well, listen to what the prophet of God said. He said, "Satan, he won't let you rest upon it very long. When you go to talking about the Lord Jesus and about his works, he is going to be right there to interrupt that. &gt;&gt; That's what's going on. You keep thinking, "What did I do wrong? Do I not have faith? I didn't get what I thought I got." Come on. Am I talking to somebody? Has anybody ever been there where you've been in a really good service? The pastor has brought the word. He spoke directly to your life and directly to your situation. You talked to it to the wife on the way home. My goodness, Lord was really speaking to our needs and and things are going to be different. We're going to we're going to get our home right. We're going to get our life right. We're going to go on with Jesus. And you start making the right things right and and getting rid of the wrong things and and all of a sudden one day, two day, one week, two week go by and all of a sudden a big test shows up and a big trial and and maybe something happens. You say, "What did I do?" &gt;&gt; Well, you did exactly what you said you did. You took God at his word. You testify that he did something for you. But our prophet said, "Satan ain't going to let you uh rest up very long." &gt;&gt; He's right there to interrupt that. Now, he starts to speak about the disciples and how they were out on the boat. He said, "Trouble arose and all of a sudden the ship begin to rock. The sails blew off and the orars broke and the water filled up the boat and trouble was at hand. See, it happened suddenly. All hopes of survival was gone. Though they had seen him do so many great things. Can you testify to that? &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm here to have church. Y'all here to have church. &gt;&gt; Well, you might be tired. It might be Wednesday. But he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And I choose to worship. I choose to give him praise. I choose to Amen. I choose to have a good time. Look, I had a good time out in the world. I'm done having good times out in the world. I come to church to have church. I come to church to have a good time. I don't want to have a good time out in the world. There's only a bad time out there. So, I want to tell you, when I can get happy, when I can have my fun is when I get together with God's people. &gt;&gt; Hey, I like coming together. I like to praise him. I like to worship him. Because you go back out there, that's where the trial, that's where the test is, and that's where the devil's trying to interrupt things. But I like it when I can come to church and we brought our little licks of fire and the pillar of fires here and it's swirling around. And if you need a blessing, if you need deliverance, if you need healing, he's here to give it to you. Hey, I come to have church tonight. Trouble's at hand. See, all hopes of survival was gone. Though they they they had seen him do so many great things. When trouble strikes, they forget all about it. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to ask you something, brother. Isn't that about the attitude of the people today? &gt;&gt; We'll come to church here and shout and praise God when our brothers and so forth speak the word and we can hear the promises. We just praise God for what he's done. Listen at the testimony of the one saying, "I once was blind, uh, but now I see." And we hear the miraculous healings and the people testify and a and pray prayer requests have come over and then the praise report goes forward and oh uh we rejoice and we gather together. &gt;&gt; He says but just let it strike our little house one time. &gt;&gt; Then we forget all about that glory &gt;&gt; that we've been enjoying. &gt;&gt; All those great things. Oh, it's it's us now. &gt;&gt; See, those things happen for a purpose. &gt;&gt; They happen to try you. &gt;&gt; Trouble strikes and then we forget. We forget all that God's done. &gt;&gt; You know, we we've we've heard the testimonies. We've we've been in the church. I I say we could have we could have uh saints stand up one by one and testify of the supernatural gone around the world testifying preachers picking up the testimonies and testifying of the supernatural because he's the saint yesterday to am I talking to somebody has somebody experienced the supernatural touch of almighty God. Has somebody been healed? Have they been delivered of cancer? Have you been delivered of something in your body that the doctors give up? But Jesus Christ been the same yesterday, today, and forever. He came on the sun scene and healed you. Has somebody had a lost way in a prodical son that was out there in the world, but you prayed and you prayed and you held all life and you kept on praying and God brought him back into the fog. I want to tell you that's the supernatural. &gt;&gt; And we rejoice and we praise God and we thank God for all the things that he done and then all of a sudden we're so thankful for what he did for brother J. We're so thankful what he did for Sister L. We're so thankful what he's done for each one of us. But then all of a sudden it strikes her. Oh no. &gt;&gt; Oh, is God with me? &gt;&gt; What did I do to deserve this? &gt;&gt; We forget all about it. &gt;&gt; We start to point fingers. We start to wonder, is it the church's fault? Is it is it do we got this wrong? Is it my wife? Is it me? Should I quit my job? Should I should what what Lord, why is this all befalling me? See, that's what happens sometimes when the strike the the the it strikes suddenly and all of a sudden you find yourself in a a valley and the prophet of guess God said we all we all sudden forget. &gt;&gt; Well, you know, there's one story in the Bible I I really I really I really like and and I'm just thinking about it because there was a time that David, you know, he had to go down into the valley to fight Goliath. But, you know, he got down into that valley and he had to fight Goliath. But the scripture doesn't say he forgot. David remembered. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. David got down there. He didn't say, "Oh my goodness, you know, you didn't look that big. You didn't look that big when I was up on the hill and now that I'm down in the valley and you're just, man, you really are a big giant. No wonder how my brothers are up there quaking in their boots and they don't want to fight you. You really are a man of war. You really are big and your hands as big as my whole body. What in the world am I going to do when David got down there and it looked like it was impossible? It looked like there was nothing he can do about it. David looked at that cancer. He looked at that trial and he didn't forget. He remembered. He said, "Oh, God was with me when I slayed a lion. God was with me when I killed a man and the last you ain't no different. This trial is no different. This devil is no different. This demon is no different." I say it's time. He be like tabernacles. Remember, remember the glory. Remember the outpouring. Remember the blessing. He was saying yesterday, today, friend. And he is here. I say we ought to remember. &gt;&gt; I said we ought to remember. &gt;&gt; Well, if you haven't started, I'm hoping somebody starts remembering right now. &gt;&gt; Hey, I'll give you some time to do it. You remember when you were out out there in the chicken yard of denominations? Do you remember when you were out there in the muck and mire of sin and the only god you had was drugs and alcohol &gt;&gt; and it could never fill that void in your life? Do you remember out there when you went to all the denominational churches and it just never struck the chord with you? &gt;&gt; You remember growing up on the church pew and you heard that God sent a prophet and you heard brother Tim preach all your life. One day, &gt;&gt; I think there ought to be some young people in here that remembers what God did for you at camp. &gt;&gt; Satan's trying to come and rob you of your experience and tell you you don't got what you said you had. But I'm here as a servant of God to tell you you didn't get the Holy Ghost. You did have a real born again with experience with God. And Satan's trying to get you to forget. But I say you ought to stand up tonight and say, "I remember." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm talking to somebody. &gt;&gt; Hey, don't get me remembering. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I remember when I was stoked drugs and alcohol. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know where to go. I tried to call on his name. But you know what? It was a formality &gt;&gt; because I wasn't willing to die. I didn't want to give up my earthly pleasures. I wanted to hang on to some of them. &gt;&gt; Just take away the guilt, Lord. just take away the condemnation because I know I shouldn't be living like this, but let me hold on to my drinking. &gt;&gt; And I remember that. But one day I got to a place where it didn't matter. I said, "Lord, whatever this is, hey, I'm just remembering a little bit tonight. So maybe this service is for me." I got to a place where I said, "Lord, whatever this is, it's bigger than me and I need your help." Oh, and it was just like the Hebrew children in the fiery furnace. He said, "Stand back, Michael. Stand back, Warren. This is my Jeep seat. I'm coming for him." And the great Jehovah God, he dropped down in the Beth, Texas, and he changed my life. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. If you need God to come on your life right now, he'll fill you with the Holy Ghost, he'll deliver you of cancer. &gt;&gt; Hey, I need somebody to help me remember. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Prophet of all goes goes on and says trouble that we can't remedy. Seems like the doctors can't remedy. Nothing can remedy. Think of them disciples, the ores busted up. Maybe put yourself in that situation. Maybe that's how you feel tonight. Maybe your marriage is all busted up and your house is all busted up and your home's all busted up and your children ain't serving God. You feel all busted up and your orars are busted up and your boat's taking on water and you don't know how much longer you can make it. Satan just pulling it on, determining to sink your life. Doctors have given up. And that's what happens. we start to forget all that God's done and doubt starts to swirl and fear starts to press in. The prophet of God would go on and say, "Now notice trouble that they could not remedy. Then fear sets in just like it is now. Even we got fears in national troubles. We got fears in church troubles. We got fears all around everywhere." Now we say, "Well, now what can be done about it?" If we could only remember &gt;&gt; that he is in the ship. &gt;&gt; See, you say, "But yes, is he in the ship?" &gt;&gt; He is in the ship. &gt;&gt; I don't care how big the storm. &gt;&gt; How big the tumor, &gt;&gt; how big the trial, how deep the valley, I'm wanting to tell you this evening, there's light in the valley. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; Peace. &gt;&gt; Don't be weary. Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; And sometimes when you don't feel him &gt;&gt; and sometimes it doesn't feel like he's near, I say, why don't you just start remembering, &gt;&gt; Lord? I might not feel you right now, but I can think back. &gt;&gt; Oh, you might be able to think back 40, 50 years what it was like on that day when you met the Lord Jesus Christ. I tell you, it's good to revisit those things. I I I say, young people, I I I encourage you to start going to some of our elders. If you don't know their testimony and you think they've just been sitting a church pew all their life, I encourage you young people to go encourage the old the older and go. You know what, sister? Why don't you tell me a little bit like it was I can testify of some of some saints in here been a real Sister Rachel's been a real encouragement to me. She's a she's a she she's a a warrior for this message. I tell you, I've sat around. I've heard her testify and I've seen her stand. I say that does something for me. You ought to go to some of the older ones, you young people, and give them a chance to testify. You know what it'll do? It'll not only light their fire again, it'll light your fire. &gt;&gt; Hey, this gospel is from faith to faith. &gt;&gt; And you older people, if you've seen a young person's life be changed, why don't you go tell them say, "I see God's really done something for you." Why don't you testify what has God done for you? &gt;&gt; And the scripture talks, it's good to remember. &gt;&gt; It's good to talk about the things that God has done in our life. &gt;&gt; He's in the boat. He's in the ship. Whether you feel it, whether you don't feel it, Christ is here. &gt;&gt; He goes on and says here, this is him. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. And the word is the same yesterday, today, and forever. It still just take this. It's the remedy. It's the medicine. You hearing me? It still take this. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the remedy. It's the medicine. It's the cure for every breakdown. It's the cure for every cancer. It's the cure for every ailment. It's God manifested in a word. Look, just take this. Come on, church. Just take this. &gt;&gt; It's the medicine. Just take the message of the hour. It's the medicine. It's the cure for every breakdown. It's the cure for every breakup. It's the cure for every cancer. It's the cure for every ailment. It's the cure for every being laid off. It's the cure for not having a job. It's the cure for not being able to pay your bills. It's the cure for every mistake. It's the cure for every failure. It's the cure for whatever you're going. I'm saying what we need to do is take this tonight. The word of God is always the answer. It's the only answer. Man's ideas will fail. Religion will fail. But it's still just take this. &gt;&gt; It is the cure. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. I don't care if it's mental, physical, spiritual, emotional. I believe God's trying to speak to somebody. Maybe you're all emotionally erect. Maybe the anxiety and things getting to you so bad you don't know what to do. I want to tell you the cure is the word of God. &gt;&gt; And the word says he is still in the boat. He's still in the building. You didn't leave him at the last church service. You didn't leave him that camp. You didn't leave him here or there. Christ is here right now, present amongst us to meet whatever need you have. &gt;&gt; Is there somebody here that needs something? &gt;&gt; I saw a lot of hands go up in the building before we started preaching. I believe God is coming to you tonight to speak to your need. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to tell you it's the cure. It's the remedy. I don't know. What do you got need of? You're the one that raised the man. What's in your heart? This message is the cure. This word is the cure. I want to say Paul said, "I didn't come to you with enticing words, a man's wisdom, but in power and demonstration." And the Holy Ghost and fire is here tonight to perform his word the same yesterday, today, and forever in power and in demonstration. Oh, I want to tell you this, this medicine, this cure, it'll give you back your joy. It'll give you back your peace. It'll give you back your shout. It'll give you back your dance. It'll give you back your victory. It'll give you back your joy. I don't know about you, but sometimes I let the devil rob me of the joy of my salvation. And I'm here tonight to say, "I'm taking it back." Say, "You might have taken my joy. You might have taken my shot, but I'm taking it back because it still take this Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Prophet of God goes on and says, "The word is God." Jesus said, "It's a seed. The seed being planted in the right kind of ground, it'll grow exactly what it is, and every promise will be produced. We forget all about it. Know that he is in the ship." &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Help me preach &gt;&gt; or help me read &gt;&gt; or just help me. &gt;&gt; I need a lot of help. &gt;&gt; They should have known that he knew that that thing was going to happen. &gt;&gt; And we act, oh Lord, why me? And we act like God's this uh uh uh uh you know, you know, when I say when I was a kid, but I still do. You know, well, I don't want to claim it, but the doctor said I had ADD. You know, I got I you know, I'd start something, then I go to the next thing. I'd have five things going at one time and not one of them get finished. You know, I'm like, man, what's wrong with this kid? You know, I'm a visionary. I got big visions and I can start all the visions, but I don't know if I can bring them to pass. I need people to help me. And that's a that's a that's a that's a real strength is when you figure out what your weakness is. &gt;&gt; Some of us just we just want to be so strong. We don't need nobody. We don't need the preacher. We don't need God. I got the message figured out. &gt;&gt; Uh-uh. Oh. No. You You better find out you are weak and you can't do nothing. &gt;&gt; And then when you finally get to a place where you're so weak and you can't do nothing, God says, "I don't need your weakness either." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Like, wait a second. God doesn't need your ability or your your your strength or your weakness. &gt;&gt; He just needs a surrendered vessel to say, "Lord, I believe." If the word is the remedy, if it's the cure, then I'm staying with that. I'm staying with the message. I'm staying with what works. &gt;&gt; God gl God doesn't have ADD. He didn't start a work in your life and then run over and now he's working on brother Joe and he forgot all about you. And you're over here wondering, "Well, God started a work in my life, but where is he?" &gt;&gt; He's right there. He's been there the whole time. &gt;&gt; Don't get frustrated when the test comes. It's the greatest thing that ever happened. God has confidence in you because he knows what he put in you. Just like Job. &gt;&gt; Job didn't even know the revelation was in there. But when the test and the trial came and it got so dark what the revelation struck. &gt;&gt; So God lets you go through trials. He let you go through agony and times of testing. &gt;&gt; You should know that God knows. &gt;&gt; He knew it was going to happen. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Certainly he knew it. He knew all the time it was going to happen. Why? He only did it to prove to test their faith. &gt;&gt; You mean I got to be tested? You mean when I come out of church service and I say, "Yeah, I believe the word of God. I believe I repented of my sins. I believe I've been filled with the Holy Ghost and fire. Now, let's just put out the picnic blanket. Brother Joe, make us some sandwiches and bring the chips. We're going to have a picnic until the rapture comes. &gt;&gt; Don't work like that. &gt;&gt; And if you do that, the ants are going to end up in the chips. &gt;&gt; The wasp are going to be on the sandwich. The stray dogs are going to come eat it. &gt;&gt; Your picnic's going to get tested &gt;&gt; cuz it ain't a picnic. &gt;&gt; It's a battle. &gt;&gt; And you're wondering, Lord, our Lord, did you know? Yes, he knows. &gt;&gt; Cuz he knows you're a son and daughter of God. And every son and daughter of God that comes to God must be tried. It must be tested. But don't fear. God knows what he put in you. He'll never give you more than you can bear. &gt;&gt; He'll be right there with you. Certainly he knew it. &gt;&gt; He knew all the time it was going to happen. He did it to test their faith. And sometimes he does the same thing for you and me. He lets things happen just to see what we'll do about it. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? The scripture said, "Every son that cometh to God must be tried, chased, and proved." Satan will make you prove every inch of ground that you claim. Certainly, he will. Oh, and when you've claimed, I've been delivered, Brother Joe. I've been set free. I've been filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; God delivered me from pornography. God delivered me from anxiety. God delivered me from depression. That doesn't mean depression or anxiety won't show up knocking. &gt;&gt; Because what is what did the prophet say? Satan will make you prove every inch of ground that you claim. He certainly will. I want to tell you whenever those things show up that you claimed you've been delivered from, don't forget. That's not church. I'm telling you, that's not the time to forget. That's the time to remember. When anxiety comes knocking, when depression comes knocking, when pornography comes knocking, that's the time to remember. Oh, Satan, I want to tell you, I did believe God. I did take him at his word and I came down to the altar and the pillar of fire came. He touched my life. He delivered me. I've been set free. And I want to tell you that's the time to start rejoicing. Satan, you might have come back to put depression on me. You might have come back to put anxiety on me. But I am remembering tonight that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What happens if I fall? &gt;&gt; Get back up. &gt;&gt; Does that mean I wasn't delivered? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; That's not what that means. That's right. &gt;&gt; It means Satan's trying to test you &gt;&gt; and make you prove &gt;&gt; every inch of ground that you claim. See the difference many time is before you weren't fighting. &gt;&gt; Come on. I'm talking about to somebody tonight. Before you weren't fighting, you kind of just went with the flow. &gt;&gt; But when God comes and does a work in your life, now you're fighting. And if you fall, if you give in, you say, "Lord Jesus, I didn't mean to do that. Forgive me, Lord. I plead the blood of Jesus Christ. I claim the blood, Lord. Uh, forgive me for my iniquity. Forgive me for for my failure, but I'm going to get back up. Don't stay down." &gt;&gt; You get back up because what has God called you to do? He called you to prove &gt;&gt; that you are a real son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Sometimes God lets those things happen. See, we we got to remember, we got to believe what the word says about us, that I am the bride. &gt;&gt; I I I have been placed here. I was predestinated before the foundation of the world. God knew that I would be in this age and he gave me an ear to hear the voice of Malachi 4:5. I've been predestinated to overcome the devil and the wickedness of the, you know, it's gross darkness upon the look out there. It's gross darkness upon the people, but oh, arise and shine. Thy light has come. Don't be surprised when you go into a valley &gt;&gt; right now. Some of you are just proving to the devil. &gt;&gt; See, you just think, "Woe is me. Why did the trial come upon me? Why am I having such a hard time?" Because you're proving to the devil &gt;&gt; that I do got what I said I got. But I ain't the one that said it. He said it. And I'm just taking sides with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I say there ought to be a victory shout in the camp of God. You don't have to be discouraged in the valley. You don't have to be worried because you're going through a hard time. It's God only testing you and allowing that faith that's inside of you to prove that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Maybe you you've been in a valley and you haven't heard from God in a long time. You haven't felt his presence in a long time. Well, we go through times like that. &gt;&gt; That does not mean God's not with you. Prophet of God said, "I believe it's joyful and happy." But remember, brother, it's the way of agony and suffering in the cross. &gt;&gt; You must realize that, too. Just as Timothy would say, if we suffer, we shall also reign with him. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm trying by God's grace, my burden is to speak to somebody specifically. It's not always smooth. &gt;&gt; It's not always easy. It's not always outward uh joyous a and like you're just floating on the clouds. &gt;&gt; It's rugged. There's agony and suffering and real heartache and real heartbreak and lost loved ones and family troubles and things that you go through and you feel like you can't talk to nobody about it and maybe you're embarrassed that you're going through it. That does not change that you are a son and daughter of God. A matter of fact, the prophet of God is encouraging you, telling you it's actually a good evidence that God is with you because the test is the greatest thing that ever happened. Oh, I say you might be brokenhearted. You might be in agony. You might be really going through a hard time. You might not have felt like God has spoken to you a long time. But I say it's time to start remembering, Lord. You started the work. And I know that it wasn't me that did it, Lord Jesus. But one day, you came and you started calling my name, Lord. and you put something on the inside of me to respond to that call. And I'll never forget what you've done for me. I thank you for Calvary. I thank you for the blood. I thank you for the Holy Ghost. But Lord, I'm going through a really hard time right now. But you told me in your word that you'd be with me. You'd be even in me. You would never forsake me, but you would be with me till the end. Oh, you might be going through a hard time, but God is telling you, I am with you. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Prophet said in the church age he said he may commit you to death as he did Paul. He may commit you to suffering as he did Job. That is his prerogative. He is sovereign. But it's always with a purpose. If he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of peace. It's what Job said. He said, "A man that is born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble." Has anybody Is anybody hearing me? &gt;&gt; Anybody been going through some hard times? &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but out there it's it's wicked, man. It's dark. &gt;&gt; I mean, we we are living in such a a time of sinful acts of violence and and just people are total total have totally lost their mind. The prophet of God said, "If this goes uh for another 50 years, it'll be totally insanity." And to think that we're living in the time where we are seeing total insanity. Common sense is not common anymore. You can't even talk facts or reason with people. There's like no basis for their reality. They they believe things that aren't even real. And it has no absolute. It has no footing. The only thing you can tie it back to is that the lid of hell has been ripped off. And 200,000,000 demons have been loosed upon the earth. And you're seeing demons pressing themselves into people's lives and possessing people and causing them to do uh the most heinous things that we've ever seen. &gt;&gt; And and you wonder why our young people are are having a hard time. And you you wonder why there's there there there's difficulties praying and you you wonder why there's so many emotional challenge. Come on. We're living in the darkest age that man has ever seen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then right in the own ranks of the message where we we we're experiencing uh uh deep uh uh uh uh dark uh things that a Christian should uh you're hearing about uh churches and and and families and breakups and things happen and you thought my how did they ever get to that place? Look, I I'm telling you uh Satan's out there like a roaring lion. He he wants to tear up homes and tear up marriages and tear up churches. And then if you have your life right and you are serving God and you're filled with the Holy Ghost and you're doing what the word says to do and you're walking with the Lord, you still go through hard times, &gt;&gt; heartache and brokenness and and you you you might not understand what's going on. Look, that's the time and seasons that we go through. But as we read, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Maybe this is simple tonight. &gt;&gt; But somebody needs to know that he's with you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody needs to know that in your trial and your heartache &gt;&gt; and your brokenness, he's with you. &gt;&gt; And in that valley, there's light in the valley. &gt;&gt; I like this in Psalms 27. For in the time of trouble, if we've ever lived in troublesome times, for in the time of trouble, he shall hide me in his pavilion. In the secret place of his tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall set me up upon a rock. I I want to testify to you this evening that that's a real place for the believer, the rock of revelation. I want to tell you if if if if if the word of God and the Bible and listening to the message of the hour and the ministry and the five-fold and your pastor preach if if it's just kind of a set of rules and it's just kind of a better way to live. And I want to tell you there is a real revelation. There is a real change for the believer where it becomes a reality to you where it's just not rules and regulations and you trying to o obey a dress code. Look, if you're just trying to obey a dress code, that is not liberty. That is bondage. Now I you know I that that's good that you're trying but you can surrender to a greater power than that you have &gt;&gt; because look if you're trying to manifest the message with your ability you will fail. If you're trying to be a good Christian with your ability you will fail. But if you come to the place where you die out knock stalk and barrel and say Lord I've tried it on my own and I can only be good so far but what I need is I need another power. I need the Holy Ghost and power to come and transform my life and make me a new. And then what happens? He comes inside of you and he starts living out the very word that you're hearing. It's no longer you that's living, but greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. Greater is he that is in you than that cancer. Greater is he that is in you than that lust. Greater is he that is in you than that pornography. Greater is he that is in you. It's no longer you trying. It's no longer you wrestling. It's you in a total surrender to the Lord Jesus Christ. And now he's coming to your body. He's coming to your bones. And it's no longer you that's living, but it's Christ that's living in you. The message of the hour taken on flesh and your skin and your body. So then when that anxiety and that depression comes back, you can say, "Boo devil. I done died." And it's the Lord Jesus Christ that same yesterday, today, and forever. Shut up in my bones. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It is not I that liveth, but Christ &gt;&gt; that liveth in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because faith is a revelation. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said in the rapture, he said, "Faith is something that has been revealed to you &gt;&gt; like it was to Abraham." &gt;&gt; That could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him as though it wasn't. So, &gt;&gt; did you hear that? &gt;&gt; Faith, something that's been re revealed to you that you could call anything. &gt;&gt; Oh, that means faith has a voice. Huh? &gt;&gt; Faith has a voice to call anything contrary to the word. &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's your situation. &gt;&gt; It's a lie and vanity. &gt;&gt; I don't care if the doctors wrote it up and said, "You only got four months to live." I say, "Faith has a voice." &gt;&gt; Yeah, the doctor might have a voice. My symptoms might have a voice, but faith also has a voice. And it's the word of God. And I will say what the word says. By his stripes, I am healed. I am predestinated. I am going in a rapture. I am the bride of Jesus Christ. I can do all things. &gt;&gt; Faith. It's time we start speaking the word, church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Faith has a voice. &gt;&gt; Yes, it does. &gt;&gt; Well, you might as well just call those things that are contrary to the word. Start speaking the word. &gt;&gt; Tell that devil he's a liar. &gt;&gt; Devil, you are a liar. I am the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Devil, you're a liar. I am going in a rapture. Devil, you're a lie. I do got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Well, you failed. You did this. You did that. Well, I'm going to say what the word says. Blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impute sin. Hallelujah. Because the seed of God remainth in me. A matter of fact, a vindicated prophet came and said, "You're justified. You never did it in the first place. You are perfect. I'm just going to keep saying what the word says, and I'll say it. You can point to my faults. You can point to my thirst. But I'm going to keep pointing to the word. I'll keep pointing to the word. I'll keep pointing to the word. And I want to tell you, one day, I'm going to be pointing to that word. And I'm going to be changed in a moment. In a twinkling of an eye, I'll be gone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus said, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God." &gt;&gt; What are you living by? We'll work towards a close quickly. Jehovah and the prophet said to the royal seed called predestinated to eternal life. The royal seed of Abraham, they believe that word. I don't care what comes or goes, how much they laugh, who says this or that or the other. They are ordained to eternal life. And she goes right straight back. Her and her lover, Christ is one. The life, the spirit that's in Christ is in the church. Well, glory to God. I don't care what comes or goes. &gt;&gt; I don't care how bad it gets or how easy it gets. You can laugh at me. You can make fun of me. But I like to say it like my prophet said, "Just leave me alone. I am happy this way." &gt;&gt; I like how David says this. He says in Psalm 62 and verse 6, he says, "He only is my rock &gt;&gt; and my salvation. &gt;&gt; He is my defense. &gt;&gt; I shall not be moved. &gt;&gt; In God is my salvation and my glory. &gt;&gt; The rock of my strength and my refuge is in God. Trust in him at all times, ye people. Pour out your heart before him. God is a refuge for us. Sah I want to tell you no matter the test, no matter the trial, no matter what I'm going for, God is my refuge. And I am going to pour out my heart. I choose to worship. I choose to praise in the valley, on the mountaintop, in the good times, in the bad times. I don't care how bad it gets. I'm going to pour out my heart. I'm going to give him praise. Why? Because there's light in the valley. I don't care how dark it gets. I don't care how rough the road is. I will give him praise. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, he shall set you up upon a rock &gt;&gt; of revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more, &gt;&gt; but ye see me, because I live, ye live also. At that day ye shall know that I am in the father and the father in me and I in you. When is that? That's this day &gt;&gt; when the revelation comes forth. When the word is opened up and the word comes an invisible union. Now it's it's I and you and you and me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll just invite the musicians to come. We'll try to work quickly to a close because I I I believe God's speaking to somebody right now. Prophet of God said the power of revelation brings stimulation to the believer. &gt;&gt; He said there is a power of revelation of the word gives stimulation of joy to the believer. Stimulation of satisfaction. The stimulation that it's vindicated and proved. Look, if you go through the testing times, if you're just always going through a cycle of revival and death, &gt;&gt; God bless you for fighting. God bless you for trying. But I want to tell you young people and old alike, you can end the cycle of revival and death right now. God has an eternal prescription and it's never changed. Repent of your sins and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost. Look, I want to tell you it works. Just take this. It works. It's the eternal prescription. Quit trying to live off of secondhand revelation. Quit trying to do it on your own. There is an oldfashioned altar. There is still the oldfashioned Holy Ghost and fire that can come and change you and set your soul on fire. And it's no longer you trying to live the message. It is Christ in you living out the message. Oh, my Bible says if that same spirit that dwelt in Jesus Christ dwell in you, it will quicken your mortal body. I'm not just looking for a quickening to come, but I'm also being quickened right now. Day by day, he's quickening my thoughts. He's quickening my actions. He's quickening my mind. &gt;&gt; Maybe we can sing that song. Speak to the mountain. I want to say whatever's trying to discourage you, &gt;&gt; make you doubt, rob you. I say hit it with the word. Heavens and earth will pass away but his word will never pass away. [Music] Do we know that song speak to the mountain? Uh why should I worry you? [Music] Whatever is trying to discourage you, I say let's take sides with the word. He said, "I won't leave you." And somebody, you've been questioning if he's with you. [Music] You've been wondering, "Lord, where have you been? I've been going through a hard time. The devil says you're not going to make it." What do you do? Hit him with the word. &gt;&gt; Come on. Don't let the devil rob you. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil shut you up and back you up into a corner. Don't listen to his lies &gt;&gt; telling you, "Look, you failed again." And see, that just shows you ain't got it. &gt;&gt; Look, everybody else is, you know, everybody else does this and that and they rejoice. But you you you be you. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you, if you're a son and daughter of God, you got a right to the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; You got a right to the word of God. And you got a right to every promise. You say, "Devil, I am sick and tired of listening to you boast." The children of Israel, they listened to Goliath boast for how many days? But the prophet of God said Goliath one mistake. Was his boast ended up falling on the ears of David. And I say we are of the same faith seed. I say devil, your boast has fallen on the wrong ears tonight. I'm going to fight for the bride of Jesus Christ. You back up. I'm going to fight for every single one of them to be delivered, to be healed, to be filled with the Holy Ghost. You are not alone. God is with you. You can be healed by his stripes. You're already healed. You can receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I say, if he don't move, what do you do? Hit him with the word. &gt;&gt; And if he don't move, hit him again. I say as we sing this song, I say some people with faith, why don't you start hitting that old devil? &gt;&gt; May maybe you maybe you know a brother or sister that's having a hard time. I said, "Let's bind our faith together. I want to see God move amongst us. I I want to see somebody healed. I want to see somebody delivered." Look, tomorrow may never come, Brother Joe. &gt;&gt; You might not make it to Thursday. &gt;&gt; I want to say, "What happens if this is our last moment on this side &gt;&gt; to praise him?" &gt;&gt; Could be. &gt;&gt; What happens if this is the last time? I don't know. But it makes me start thinking, Lord, I want to play my part. &gt;&gt; And if that devil's running his mouth, hit him with the word. &gt;&gt; I am sanctified. I am filled with the Holy Ghost. My son will be saved. My daughter will be saved. You start claiming your prodals. You start claiming, I say, you take the word of God. You hit him with the word. The prophet of God said, "And if you whack him the first time, it don't seem to move. Whack it again and whack it again and whack it again and whack it until you chip the hole through like a little chicken peeping itself out. But you're an eagle what you are. Peep yourself right up through that old shell of sickness. Cut your way out and say, "Hallelujah. Where's the next one?" Hey, I believe somebody here is going to get so filled with the Holy Ghost and all them demons and all them giants that have been fighting you, you're going to cut his head off and you're going to say, "Hey, where's the next one?" I think it's time to start fighting for our brothers. It's time to start fighting for our sisters. Hey devil, I'm going to beat you right out of the back of the church. There ain't no place for that demon of doubt. Get out of here, devil. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, why should I worry when giants come calling my name? Oh my God. So much &gt;&gt; in the troubles. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And why would I hunger for power or riches or fame? Oh my. My God is so much better than all of these things. And I won't be shen. [Applause] [Music] And my God is faithful. His promise is true. So I'll speak to the mountain. [Music] It's high. Oh my God is bigger, better, greater than you. &gt;&gt; And my enemies scatter cuz they know the battle is done. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see, my God is stronger. The victory already won. And he died for my race and rose up on the third day. [Applause] Oh my God is greater than death. [Music] I won't be shen. Oh, I will be &gt;&gt; and my God is faithful. His promise is true. So I'll speak to the mountain. Oh, it's my God is bigger, better, stronger, gater you [Music] won't be shen. Oh, and I won't be moved. My God is faithful, promise is true. So I'll speak to the mountain. Oh, it's time to move. [Music] My God is bigger, better, stronger, gater than you. [Music] I just want to speak the name of Jesus, over every heart and every mind.
