be upon the word as Goes Forth that you'll open up our understanding and to real make the word real in our hearts and our lives forgive us of our shortcomings our sins help us Lord to do what's right we want to serve you with all our heart we're asking for the anointing of your spirit upon us today that you'll just come in your own special way now as we read the word Lord bless it to our hearts in Jesus name amen amen God bless you it's good to be here today let's turn to Zechariah chap 4 and verse 6 for our scripture reading this morning we look once more into this wonderful scripture that actually prophesies of in time it will say it'll even give the the name for this Tabernacle it'll say it shall be light in the evening time that's where we take our name because of this light that is here and we want to be the Tabernacle of that evening light amen Zechariah 4: 6 then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord of hosts who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it amen God bless you can be seated amen we going to speak this morning on the headstone of Salvation amen and what a what a wonderful word that God gives us in his scripture as he prophesies of the end time and things that are to be fulfilled in this last day and of course as we have went through this we have seen that the work Redemption is actually completed in a in a three-fold manner and we're just going to go over that briefly again because the headstone must come to each first there has to be a finishing stone that is the Capo of the mysteries of God that restores the church back to what it was before it went down to Babylon and none of this is are new truths nor additions to the Bible it is a restoration of the original word and Gospel of Jesus Christ in so much that it is Jesus coming in the form of his word as the finishing Stone and uh as I just share with you this little quotation here uh from there is only one provided by God for anything um now he also promised it would be a restoring of the faith we read over in Jude that it said in Jude earnestly contend for the faith that was was once delivered to the Saints now we are promised in Malachi 4 by the same system and we know the system God uses is a prophetic voice amen because he does nothing un unless he Reveals His secrets to his servants the prophets so we're promised in Malachi 4 by the same system that he always did that we would be restored back to the original Faith oh my what back to the original seed back to the seed like it began on the day of Pentecost back to the same Doctrine word by word Power by power Spirit by the same thing just exactly like it was in the beginning through signs and wonders of the living presence of Jesus Christ after 2,000 years he's still alive and he's the same yesterday today and forever and then of course then second we want to look at The Headstone of salvation is what we're our subject will be on today because you are also the temple you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost and as zerubabel in the days of Zachariah was restoring the temple to its its proper place and Jerusalem the city of God to his proper place well then we also know that as a temple of the Holy Ghost that those some parts may have been restored to Luther and Wesley and more power in theza street but there comes in our day where the finishing stone is brought forth not simply something where we're just justified by faith or just Sanctified by Grace um not not only empowered by the spirit but the person of Christ himself so Christ must be the headstone of every Temple he is the stone that the builders disallowed and even today they will not recognize him and put him in the proper place where the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the crowning thing for every believer that there is and of course then third which we want cover today that Redemption is not finished is by without bringing forth The Headstone Jesus Christ in a literal physical body with the meeting in the air that is the hope of the ages so when you're you're listening to the messages and you hear Brother Bron speak about The Headstone coming and the head United with the body you have to determine what are what is he talking about is he talking about the the truth restored or is he talking about um the the bride of Christ by receiving those truths receiving the headship of the word or is he talking about The Headstone for for the believer or is he talking about uh the coming of the Lord Jesus because that is something that describes all three aspects of redemption what God is redeeming in this day but today we want to speak on The Headstone of Salvation where Christ is The Headstone or the finishing Stone to our lives for the head of every man the Bible says is Christ The Headstone of the individual the person of the Holy Ghost himself we're not speaking in that of of a gift although it is a gift it is not um it's not a gift like I would give you a gift but it is he is coming himself as your gift you'll receive the gift of the Holy Ghost not a a gift of the spirit such as tongues your prophecies or or um interpretation of tongues and that kind of gift but no the gift of the person himself Jesus Christ coming into your life so you see it's the person of the Holy Ghost not a gift not a dance not a jump not not simply um a a forgiveness of sin not cleansing of sanctification but the person himself being Christ in you the hope of glory now listen Church um we it's very clear and and I quote this from the messenger Satan don't kill care how religious you are or how right you are in your Doctrine if you miss that life you won't come up anyhow no matter how religious or how good or how many churches you belong to or or will belong to it doesn't matter one thing unless you have been born again so Satan really doesn't care you know about church attendance he comes to church too he don't really care whether you believe in God he believes in God too he don't care whether you're religious because Satan is religious too he is he is uh he worshiped it from the beginning he was created for worship and and and so you know he don't care how religious he don't care about how often you attend church or don't attend church you know just one thing if you miss that life and I just say what a Pity would it be for you to go to church all your life and miss him amen now as I said Satan don't care if you attend church yet you should attend church amen gee that was Jesus custom it was on his custom he went to the um to the synagogue on the Sabbath day the Bible said as was his custom amen the scripture said we should even a together even so much the more even as we see that day approaching and and that means as the time comes near that we we shouldn't treat that you know flippantly but we should put our heart into it amen but Satan don't care if you dress right he don't care how you wear your hair you know or if you even wear it correctly or he don't care how right you are in your Doctrine he don't care how well whether you how well you can quote the message maybe you can quote it like a machine gun you know but nothing matters unless you have been born again and that is that is crowned with de by being filled with the spirit unless that headstone that finishing stone is upon your life you your wall is still broken down and he will get in somewhere and and when the when The Headstone comes you are sealed to the day of redemption and Satan is sealed out amen now you know in the days of Paul there were men who were you know followers of him they were at least observers of him attended his meetings and admired what he did and and and and no doubt would say I believe he's a a messenger from God in fact they studied him and they believed in him and I'm talking about the seven sons of ska that they they would recognize him as a prophet they might they might have wore their Eagle belt buckles they might have had the hofman's head of Christ on their wall or they were devout listeners of his sermons they might have you know practice a quiet time and and listen to every tape but the headstone was missing and the Holy Ghost wasn't there and the devil knew it but he said Paul I know and Jesus I know but I don't recognize you as having Authority and power over me amen remember this when they when they came and tried to cast out this devil there and the and the devil rose up and just ripped them boys to Pieces saying Jesus I know Paul I know but I I don't recognize you as having one of authority now listen this is this is a position of a holy ghost filled Christian that Satan knows not to fool with you he knows who you are he knows you have been born again amen now he may come to you like he did with Jesus and try whether Temptation and make you doubt it but he knows he knows he knows because you met him in battle and you've defeated him time on time and time again because you are an overcomer now when you have the new birth which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost the devil has to recognize you as a Son of God with authority over him now there is a difference between a profession of faith and having the spirit these men these men had a profession of faith in fact they were they were so sure they could use this name of Jesus just like Paul did and they thought the Devils would be subject to them but there is a difference between a profession of faith and having the spirit remember the wise and the foolish virgin in Matthew chapter 25 the difference between them was the oil amen the the they were all virgins amen they were all pure they the the foolish had vessels they had professions of Faith they were saying I'm a Christian I'm a believer I'm a a believer in in the message they were virgins they had even had some in the past some experience with God but with but without oil their lamps had gone out amen you you see you see there are many that come along and and they the fire of God will even come upon them and they'll burn for a little bit but because the oil is not there there's never been a filling of God's spirit there's never been where they have him in possession they got him they got him on the flesh realm and in that flesh realm they shouted and they rejoiced and they danced the aisles or or they said I believe the message oh this is the truth and they have a profession Faith but without the oil their lamps go out amen well you know I can hear some say brother Tim I I I really try I try to be good now I want you to understand you can be a good person and go to hell amen you know when when the when the when the Rich Young Ruler called Jesus good in Mark 10:18 he says Jesus Jesus said there is none good but one that is God so there's only one that is good and that's God and if you if there if any if there's any real true goodness it has to come from God Amen you say well my my son's a good boy well so was the Rich Young Ruler amen he was a good boy the the Bible said in Romans chap 3 and verse2 they're all going out of the way they are all together become unprofitable there is none that doeth good know not one so without Christ no matter what we do no matter how we try no matter what kind of efforts that we do to be religious without Christ we've totally lost everything amen now you see somehow we think we somehow we got it in our minds today is it's the prevalent con concept that is you know that is ground into people especially in the society that we live in somehow we think if we love Jesus if we love Jesus that earns us a place in heaven right somehow God will let us go on let us go in on the Merit of I love I love God and there's many many people that do that but I I love J Jesus I I I I love I I believe I believe in him well the devil does too and he trembles amen well you know but but I love him brother Tim you see you can love with your human Spirit there's people that loves football there's love people that love pizza there's a people that loves a certain politician and people love Jesus the same way amen oh they admire him they you know they admire his character they they admire his uh his goodness they admire him but they don't know him they've never received him you see you can love with your human Spirit that's one of the inlets you can love and I'm quoting brother brandom here you can love and even love God and still not be right you can love and even love God and still not be right you see like I said you know what we want to know is are you changed you know does your life obey the word now here's the test on whether you really love God here is John 14:15 if you love me keep my Commandments amen amen now anybody can make the profession and they do by the millions I love Jesus but you see here is the test of whether you really truly love him do you keep his word and that's what that's the real test for his whether you love him because there are things that I I love him I I love his character I love what his Miracles I love his words and I I I committed those to memory but do you keep his Commandments now that's where love really shows his color amen now because you you know like I said there are so many that think today I can't go to hell Jesus loves me too much Jesus loves me he loved me first so I can't go to hell because because Jesus loves me the Bible says that Jesus in Mark 10:21 looked at the Rich Young Ruler and said then Jesus beholding him loved him that's right God so loved the world and yet this man would be given the test you know are you going to follow me well this is what it's going to require of you I I see what's in your way go take everything that you have and sell it and come and follow me give that to the poor and come and follow me now every person doesn't have to do that but Jesus looked at the man and he saw the problem in his life amen and although this man was a good man and said I've kept the the law I've done righteous works all of my life and he he went away sorrowful rejecting Jesus and the love of Jesus because he had great possessions now here's the mountain facing every man or woman a mountain that only God can move and I'm going to read it to you and it's in Matthew 5:48 here is the mountain facing every human being be you therefore perfect well I try to be good no no no no no no no well I you know I I'm be ye therefore perfect even how perfect God how perfect Jesus as your father which is in heaven is perfect now that's a mountain I said that's a mountain that's a mountain in your way because here is the requirement of the scripture you're going to have to be as perfect as god is perfect now again we we're looking back to zerubabel here and and here he's got this insurmountable mountain of restoring the the city and and bringing but here again God God gives a requirement and there's a mountain in your way that says You must be this perfect as perfect as your father in Heaven amen let me tell you this is a God who demands Holiness in first Peter 1:15 he said but as he which has called you is Holy how many believes he's holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation in other words all manner of life because it is written be ye holy for I am Holy you want to go to heaven I'm how many wants to go to heaven am mean you want to see Jesus how many wants to see Jesus Hebrews 12:14 says without Hol without Holiness no one will see the Lord so he's demanding Perfection he is demanding Holiness and I'll just tell you you can't climb that mountain and I'm going to just tell you you can't move that mountain amen that's a huge mountain how can you be holy how can you meet God's requirement of perfection because it's an impossible Mountain to move there's only one that can move that mountain and that's God and the only way that you can ever have that mountain moved and be perfect as he's perfect is have the perfect one in you the only way you can be holy as he is Holy is because that Holiness comes in you you see as I've said over and again only Christ can live the Christian Life I can't do it you can't do it no one else can do it it's the mountain that cannot be moved it takes Jesus in a life and without him you can do nothing now what is the evidence that you're mountain of sin is gone and that you have the Holy Ghost which is the life of Jesus this is a this is a good question it's a very deep question and some say it is saying why it's saying Amen to the word so they jump and scream and holler to show the habit and underneath too many of them are dirty filthy unchanged lives so as brother Brandon would say and from that time he said I tell you a genuine Holy Spirit experience will punctuate every sentence of the Bible with an amen right regardless of what anybody else says it will certainly do it because it's the spirit of God the writer of the Bible and the spirit of the word is the holy spirit that's what quickens it the letter kth the spirit giveth it life see it gives the printed letter life makes it manifest brings it to pass exactly what God promised so you see a genuine Holy Spirit experience will punct uate every sentence of that Bible with an amen now sure sure without without question you know yes it will give a a verbal Amen to the word amen but the evidence of saying Amen to the word is not just a mental or a verbal asent to the word being truth it is the amen with your life amen when you read it in the word of God Amen it is something that says amen so be it to me Lord according to Thy word let that word live out of me that word comes out with an amen to it amen it's the amen of your life of course verbal agreement is important but the amen is that agreement that is sent to the word word and that must be expressed through the life that you live now it's like Elijah in the cave you know there was when he went in the cave and he was looking for God there there was a Russian Mighty Wind came by it was so strong that it broke rocks apart then there was a earthquake and then there was a fire and do you know God wasn't in any of them what what was that I want you to get this the those were only the effects of him passing by amen you you will see people jump and Shout run the aisles amen that isn't that isn't really God that's the effect that's right of nature of God passing by so you respond right amen so you you see but it didn't save the rocks it just broke them the beastes you know and and I I want you to see that it not just Earth moving or Earth shaking experiences nor nor just the fire of sanctification and you quit a few habits but you want to see the voice of the word that living out of your life this is what he said you know that but you know here's when he recognized it was God when that still Small Voice spoke right and that's what you're wanting to look for in your life it's not because you react to the spirit well that's really a spiritual person well they were spiritual enough they didn't sit there like a log you know they responded amen but you see again what you're looking for is the still small voice of his word living out your life and I'm not talking about on Sunday I'm talking about every day of your life amen the still small voice of the word living out of you amen you don't even claim the Holy Ghost and should not even claim the Holy Ghost and you're still lying and cheating and doing dirty business deals and you know some that claim the Holy Spirit has a has a spirit all right they got a spirit of greed that would rob their mother of the gold in their teeth amen that's not the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is pure and honest and whole holy and righteous and fair and treating others like you would want to be treated amen you know following even the golden rule of doing to others before they do it to you do it un the others as you would have them do it to you you see you see even even look look under the qualification of a deacon in a Ministry do you know do you know when Paul put this down and he he list all of these qualifications and people said well just a deacon supposed to be that way and just a preacher is supposed to be this way no those are qualifications of a Christian choose your leaders from these kind of Christians amen amen you see under the qualification of a deacon Paul said we to choose men who have good report from without the church amen he Comm He commands us to choose Godly men who are examples to those that around her not just good to church people you know and put on a front but I have a testimony from without that's right there's something about that man he's honest his word is true he never cheats he's fair in his business dealers he's moral he's upright amen all right you see the Bible said let those that name the name of Christ those who say I'm a Christian depart from iniquity this is very important you see you can you you really cannot meet God and remain the same you see a a person that claims the Holy Ghost and continues in sin and smokes and drinks continues in prostitution or even continues to dress in a provocative way I would doubt they ever met God exactly right saved you say I'm saved well saved from what he didn't come to save you in your sins he came to save you from your sins well well you said but well well we're just not perfect brother Tim we're just forgiven so we can't help but continue to sin don't you sin brother Tim well sure every day I fall short I make mistakes but Christians don't willfully sin but there are sins of omission like we don't pray the way we should amen we stood by and didn't help those that were in need and we didn't visit the sick and the needy and those in the nursing home the hospitals you know those are Christian duties and me we may maybe you know we but but let me just say a Christian doesn't habitually and willfully sin that's right Romans 61 said what shall we say then shall we continue in sin so that Grace may may abound in other words should we keep on sinning so God will just give more grace and he said God forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein now here is the Apostle Paul telling us really clear we are dead to Sin Sin and that old life is gone and we're alive in Christ let's go to 1 Corinthians 6 and9 because he gets very plain about things he says know ye not the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers and by the way in fornication and and adultery both of them that includes even even um even even pornography people want to say that's not a sin brother Tim you know I didn't do anything yes you did the Bible said if you looked upon a woman with and had lust in your heart you committed adultery wither already in your heart you see the heart needs to be changed we believe that there is a power of redemption that will cause a man to turn his head not dwell on that thing I mean you you may not help seeing some of the things that are out there the nudity that is there but you'll quickly turn your head and turn from it you see but but let me just say know you not the unrighteousness shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkers nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God none of these amen none of these shall inherit the kingdom of God those that are Covetous some that you can't trust in your business deals and on and on and on like this they're Covetous there always there's a greed about them they will not inherit you can't get the Holy Ghost till that's dead in your life amen and and so here here's a condition that you cannot inherit there is no way you can receive the Holy Ghost until that is burned out of your life so and he and so you know it looks like you know that's pretty hopeless of us because many of us sitting right here have done those very things but look at the next scripture but and such were some of you but you are washed but you are Sanctified but you are declared righteous justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God Amen so you see that was our past but that is not our future and it is not our present life because the life we live now in the flesh we live by the faith of the son of God God who loved us and gave his life for us amen now of course of course we believe the grace of God will and the favor of God will cover our lack because you know as long as we have this carnal nature it's a sticky nature and it's not converted that's right but I tell you what you got a you got a new birth on the inside with a king on the throne that can make this come subject to the word to God Amen now so let me let me just read to you from Jude 1:4 and he tells you of what the condition will be as they fall away from the faith he said certain men crep in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of God into lasciviousness into a license to sin and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ well you know bless God I I tell you what I I'm not perfect but I'm forgiven you know God will forgive me for this listen let me tell you if the desire of sin is still in your life it is the evidence that God's desire isn't there amen the Holy Spirit on the inside of you will cause you to want to do right to surrender yourself to that to yield yourself as your head now I want to show you a principle in God's word that is very very important let's go to Second Timothy chapter 2 verse 13 if we if we believe not yet he abideth faithful he cannot deny himself amen now this is a principle no matter what you do the Holy Spirit can never deny himself if someone says now now get this he cannot deny himself so none of the word can he deny if he puts something in his word he cannot back up from it he cannot deny if he's in your life and it doesn't matter you know if it's First Corinthians 11 about men and women's roles and men men and women's dress it doesn't matter if it's Deuteronomy 225 again about men and women's role and men and women's dress it doesn't matter he cannot deny himself so the Holy Ghost in you will not deny that word to have rule over you now if someone says he's met God and says I don't believe in Divine Healing then I would doubt his experience amen cuz the Holy Spirit within you cannot deny himself if he says the baptism of the Holy Ghost uh it's only emotion I I don't believe in it then I doubt he's ever experienced it himself you see to to quote the words of the Prophet to a woman that was once ill fed and smoked cigarettes and drank prostitute if that woman claims she's met God as still does in the same things I doubt her word if a man tells me he's met God and says I don't believe in such thing is Divine Healing I doubt his experience cuz God can't lie about his own word if the Holy Spirit wrote the word when he comes in it'll say Amen to every word he wrote amen if if a man says he don't believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost I doubt he's ever met God he might be called a intellectual a great man an orer of some sort but he's never met God the holy spirit of God in a man will speak Amen to every word of God say I I did not once believe in Divine Healing but one day I met God and from that time it changed me there's something come into me that transformed me it gave me an experience I've never been able to forget it no one can meet God without being changed and some way so the very best witness that we got the Holy Ghost is when our spirit Bears record with the word John 15:26 but when the comforter is come who I will send to you from the father even the spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me so you see this is the witness he will be in you and he will witness of Christ he will bear testimony of Jesus Christ everywhere you turn you will give witness amen That Jesus Lives not 2,000 years ago lives in you now if we call our Christan s Christians say we're filled with the Holy Ghost and we see the baptism of the Holy spirit is poured out on the Believers for all ages and our spirit said that's for another age you're wrong when the Bible said Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever our spirit said no he's dead he's going on there's something wrong Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also L I'm with you always even the end the world and if our spirit pulls back from that we haven't got the Holy Ghost for the holy spirit will say Amen to every word he wrot wrote now intellectual knowledge will pull you away from it but the holy spirit will say Amen to his own word he certainly will and he's seeking and hunting and trying to find someone he can put himself into he longs to do it wow well brother Tim I I know a Christian should go to church let me just let me just back up for a minute a Christian will go to church there will be something in his heart that drives him right well you know I'm I'm already perfect I don't need any help well there's where your pro your problem is right there it's all about me I I I you ever hear about the about the turtle and the Ducks the geese one day well you know there was an old turtle out in the pond and it was about to freeze over and the geese were cracking around and said it's time to move South and the old Turtle sat down and he said well boys don't leave me he saidwell you can't fly you got to stay here said well I freeze I freezing this a p you can't leave me behind I I I tell you what I got an ideas said each I'll get a stick and I'll hold into it with the Middle with my mouth and you Ducks get a hold of it you geese get a hold of it with your feet and you can you we you can fly and take me you know here all the way into the South and I can enjoy the warmth well you know it worked for a while got way up high and flying you know up there and here come another gaggle of geese by and as they were flying by they looked over hey that's a clever idea who thought about that and the turtle said I did so much for I amen you know when you look at the word sin and it says SI i n it's got an I right in the middle but I'll tell you what you canel that I out and put a an O there where you're nothing it'll turn it into a different word it'll say so n son amen now you see that's a whole thing of the new birth it's canceling out I my will my desires my my way that's just how I am that's just how I was raised that's just how my culture is because it's all about me I but if you ever get that canceled out and you put you put that o in front of there you'll come into a son or daughter of God now you know you said well I don't attend church though cuz I tell you what there's Hypocrites there well let me just tell you you about this church let me just tell you about this church if you want to tell me there's people that come to this church that aren't born again I'll say you better believe it and I hope they do amen I hope they keep coming amen you know you say well you know I I'll tell you what brother Tim there's there's there's some of that that they just don't live right yeah there kind there's all kinds of Believers some of them are Justified their sins forgiven of the past some of them have been you can get them to be Sanctified and they've got some cleansing of some sins but there are also going to be some really genuinely filled with the Holy Ghost men and women but if you get your eyes on just people amen you will fall away just like they would in the days when Judas betrayed the Lord because he had this profession of faith and he even did Miracles and even shouted and had everything else but when it come down to The Showdown he didn't have it now well I I don't come I don't come to church because there's Hypocrites you know what the word hypocrite means it means actor Jesus would use the word there and coin it in his day for those who are just acting he said you Pharisees you're actors you're not really genuine you're actors and and he said you and and let me just tell you there are people that are actors that come to church they act like they dress up like Believers but their hearts never been changed and I'm just going to give you a a a a warning right here you're not going to find a church where everybody is perfect you you'll find them in all stages of growth that's right we're going to have those that are Justified we're going to have those that are Sanctified and we're going to have those that are sealed to the day of redemption you'll find them in all stages of growth a a church is where imperfect humans come to become perfect now Church attendant itself won't do it but a nature change will that's right and that when you get in the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost that's right come on if there's a c Gene of God in there you're going to start developing something's going to start changing on the inside of you that's right now I'm just going to tell you if you if you find a perfect church I'm just going to ask you please listen to me don't go there because you're going to ruin it because once you there it won't be perfect no more now you see a hypocrite you know a lot of people will hide behind that well there's people there that don't do right yeah there are amen and you'll hide behind it but you know you got to be smaller than what you hide behind that's right so if you hide behind an old hypocrite because he he's a hypocrite and and and there's Hypocrites go there and you hide behind that you're little than they are I tell you what I would rather be a somebody even a hypocrite an actor that is still coming to church and knocking on the door and asking so that they can receive and seeking so they can find and knocking that it' be open to them I'd rather see that than somebody you say well I tell you I wash my hands of all of it amen but I want to to say shame on those who claim the spirit and living a little sneaky dirty life brother Bram said that in the Ephesian Church age but today people like this is the only thing there live like this is the only thing there was live here on the earth that's all you don't realize you got a soul that's going to leave here and go somewhere and you seal your destination right here the way you live the way you do out holding grudges and mean and everything and then rub the church oh mercy shame on you we we you you bring a reproach upon the cause of Christ isn't that right don't we do it the the Bootleggers ain't hurting the church it isn't that it isn't the prostitute that's hurting the church it's the people who profess to be Christians that's hurting the church we know what the boot leer is and The Prostitute is but when our sisters dress like a prostitute that's different that's what hurts the church when a man drinks like the bo leer well that's what hurts the church they're professing to be a Christian and they do that and and people look for you that name let him that even names the name of Jesus Christ depart from iniquity get away from it I I just want to say to you as a church body today be careful in your deep deing with others if you name the name of Christ depart from iniquity the least thing you want to do is bring shame on the name of Christ upon the church the body of Christ upon the message of the hour hallelujah amen don't be guilty of bringing shame on the name of Jesus Christ right now right now even today the newspapers are full of horror stories because men have brought shame on the message of Jesus Christ amen now you see as brother brandom said it is rizing the how can you say the spirit dwells in you though you've done everything you thought was right here's your evidence whether you got or not if that spirit that was in Christ is in you it also quickens you to the word for he is the word if it if it's contrary it quickens you away from the word that it isn't the spirit of Christ and my my sheep hears my voice and they live by every word every word amen so you see this is what that a man must live here's where real Christian Life is living by every word and if the holy spirit is in your life it will Quicken you to the word oh yeah you'll be tempted but in that Temptation what will you do go to the word amen now as he said in who is this mezc like you women claiming the Holy Ghost and going out here and wearing shorts and things how could you do it how could the spirit of God in you ever let you do such a thing as that it just can't be he's not a filthy Spirit he's a Holy Spirit and when you be become subject to that Spirit it throws your whole being subject to that spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world but the seed word made manifest her quickened Hallelujah Made Alive and what the Bible says don't do this the body quickly turns to to it there's no question so here's the thing if if the word says something you quickly turn to it you turn away from sin and you turn to what the word said because it again the love of God's in your heart you're going to what keep his Commandments now you see there was a time that the inoculation for sin wasn't too good in the Old Testament there was a conscience always of sin and a man worshiper would have to come year by year and and make his offering so they were continually offering lambs and and on and on and on and on because it didn't last you see the the nature of that woolly animal lamb could not come back upon the believer but that's not so under this Covenant in this Covenant the the life of your sacrifice the life of your lamb returns back upon you as a Believer and it's Christ now living out his life in you amen now if you want want to know if you want to know the Eternal prescription is not changed remember I don't care how much Peter had a revelation and and and it was from God I don't care how much they profess to believe th art the Christ the son of the Living God had confession of Faith he was not converted Jesus would say to him Peter after you are converted strengthen your brethren he do this he does this on the day of Pentecost and and there Peter on the day of Pentecost gives Eternal prescription and nothing let me tell you it's an eternal one I don't care how modern things get I don't care what the public cinnamon is amen the prescription for sin does not change and if you try to tber with it it will not an culate you from death amen this is why brother Bram said that somebody has messed with the prescription is why sin is still in the church but he gave an eternal prescription and you know what that is Acts 2:38 Peter said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen now let me just say again the Holy Ghost as a gift he will gift you with himself amen so notice the very very first there are F the very first uh part of the prescription is repentance that's right if you don't get that right you will never get the spirit of God amen you you see in in Acts chapter 3:19 he says repent ye therefore and be converted so again repentance is a part of conversion and and so he said repent and be converted that your sins might be blotted out so here again here this is how we get our sins remitted that's right if we come and re repent we we acknowledge our wrongs amen we we say it's more than a a lip service of saying I'm sorry but it's a it's a Godly sorrow for our sins amen listen repentance is not an option amen Acts chapter 17 verse 30 says that God commandeth all men every everywhere to repent so repentance is a commandment here again it's part of the prescription it's it's some of the things that are put together in the vaccine the Divine vaccine and if it ain't there so you just might as well be pumping water into you or air amen God commanded all men everywhere to repent you see we we go back to this inoculation and I I want to just talk about it for a minute cuz the Old Testament didn't have it they were given the law and they tried to be righteous and there was a perfection even as Paul would say if this Perfection required or was it James where he said if you sin in one point you're guilty of all of it you might do this right and that right and this right and that right and this right and that right but if you s in one point you're guilty of doing everything now David was a predestinated seed but he lacked the water of the spirit to make the seed alive to Quicken it so he was constantly falling and no matter how predestinated every genuine seed must be quickened by the spirit this this is where we have gone on predestination even around the message well I'm predestinated I'm a predestinated see if that seed does not get quickened by the baptism by the Holy Ghost it's just going to remain dormant on the inside of you it takes a quickening power of God to make that seed come to life to germinate it makes no difference how predestinated you are and I do you believe you are predestinated to adoption to becoming sons of God I believe that there that is your destiny and I want to even tell even a sinner today that that I want to believe for you that's your destiny your destiny is not to remain a sinner all your life live an assorted evil life I want to tell you there's a Destiny for you but I tell you the only way the only way that that seed can ever come to life is by an oldfashioned outpouring of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that quickens and brings that seed to life now otherwise it leaves it leaves lives dormant and Powerless I mean let me just stop for a minute you take a man and I was going to call the name use an example but I won't but you take a man that all his life he's lived the wrong kind of Life he's lived a life of sin he's a you know he's been maybe in alcohol or maybe he's been in drugs or prostitution or or or whatever every kind of evil life you take a man he has always been a a predestinated seed even when he was in a as a sinner he was a predestinated seed and you can be a predestinated seed and smoke and drink and lie and cuss and everything else because that was our past that's there ain't a seed here that they can't say I lived in corruption the life that I lived in the past I was aive of sin but there was a moment where the Holy Spirit came down upon you and Quicken that seed your life and you can never ever ever go back to being a sinner again Hallelujah because you can't kill a predestinated [Applause] seed so your sin does not change your predestination but I'll tell you there in your predestination there is a destiny set for you and that is for you to meet God whether you're 12 years old or you're 90 you're going to meet him as a predestinated seed and there will be a change of quickening of bringing to life of that seed now you know in that condition brother Bram was talking about it he said as a sinner boy I would sit here and on the creek bank and you know I I would sit up all night you know because um my parents was having a party and I lay up on the roof until uh the old 10 shed until morning till it all died down and then I would go in I'd sit out on the creek bank and I would look there and I would see there's a little flower there and I said flower how did you get here I burned a fire here last year he said how did you get there he said you see there was something in me all the time that was longing for God for longing to be quickened every one of you can say that as a sinner there was something in you that was crying out I want to do right I want to I I I don't want to live this way I want to rise up above that what was that that was that predestinated seed of the in inside of you that was crying out for life but one day the season changed I don't care if you were 16 or you were 90 the season changed and when the season changed and the rain of the Holy Spirit came down on that predestinated sea it brought it to life and you can no long no more go back to being dead again because this life eternal now we live in a polluted hour and everything has become diluted by have your way Christianity I'm going to to say this the gospel is not a smus board where you just kind of pick and choose what you want of it it is you eat it all and the outpouring of the Holy Ghost in the last days it shows you Revelation 108 take the book and eat it come on eat it all some things are bitter some things will actually kill mortify your members but you know today it's all a superficial repentance you know uh it's just you know that's just temporary yeah yeah yeah yeah Lord I'm sorry I'm sorry I shouldn't have done that you know and it's a flipping attitude listen repentance that change of mind that comes from a contract and broken heart and surrender desires they want to take that and turn it to just turn into a new Leaf or making an equivalent of a New Year's res resolution well first of the year tell you what I'm going to be different you won't maybe for a little while but even if in all your goodness and all that you try without Christ you're still nothing you you see this is the hour of cheap impersonations you're born again that's sacred experience of the cleansing of the soul the forgiveness of sin has just been reduced to church joining walk in the aisle and making a profession I believe in Jesus I believe the message the baptism of the Holy Ghost has been reduced either to emotionalism or some weak confession and I and I want to say it's not emotionalism is deity coming to dwell on the inside of the soul and there are those who want to be forgiven who never repent they want to restor but they don't want to really repent repenting is not say I'm sorry you know many times I'm sorry I got caught my life's a mess and I'm I'm sorry it's a it's just a bad mess you know whatever and and and they're sorry they caught and they throw away their Birthright and they're like Esau who then they want to just act like nothing happened that's what Esau did he he he he wanted to throw away his Birthright he had an attitude toward the new birth he just threw it away let me just say you know what the the birthright is it's the right birth and here he had here he had the the opportunity to be the air of all things and what did he do in a moment of weakness in a moment of of time he he spurned the birthright but he wanted to go right on like nothing happened he still wanted the blessings without the birthright and that's the way many people are they want God's blessing without the birthright you know they're sorry they're sorry they got caught and they throw away their Birthright and they want to act like something you know nothing nothing ever happened ah you know they still want their place of prestige they still want their honor among Brethren they still want to they want to start up where they left off you know they don't want to do it with any Godly sorrow they don't want to W with tears on the floor and agonizing for before God let me just show you here in second um Corinthians 1710 for Godly sorrow produces repentance leading to Salvation so now you're not not going to have real repentance without Godly sorrow that's right because Godly sorrow worketh repentance to Salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of death worketh death now so the sorrow of the world produces death now notice here as we look at here again Godly sorrow produces you see he is close to them here's where you want God to come close many of you will come up in the Altar and you'll say I want a closer walk with God I'll tell you where he draws M and that is to a broken and a contrite heart and the Bible said when he finds a broken and a contrite heart he will not despise it he will not turn it away well I've asked God for the Holy Ghost and I I I want the holy spirit in my life where is that broken spirit am where is that contrite heart where is that God I've done wrong I'm got to be changed amen where you sweat it out where a place where you watered out sometimes at the altar I don't care if the altar is here in your seat or there at home I don't care where the altar is but will you wed out amen where where you come to the point I I I need Jesus I don't want another minute without him amen but you see is a careless oh nobody's perfect everybody does you know I I know other I tell you what I've seen so and so they shouted all over the place and they still do this listen don't you judge your life by the others you judge your life by the word come on let's let's go to Psalms 32 and verse one blessed is the man whose transgressions Is Forgiven whose sins is covered that's the man I want to be that happy man happy is this man whose transgression is Forgiven whose sins are covered blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity and in whose Spirit there is no God he's honest he's true truthful and in his spirit and and and pure blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God so blessed is the man unto the L unto the whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity what's now when I kept Silence about my sin my bones wax old to the Roaring all the day well you know again when I kept silence my my body wasted away to the groaning all day long for day and night thy hand was Heavy upon me my moisture is turned to Drought of the summer the the hand is heavy my Vitality is drained away as a fever Heat Of Summer here here's David talking about you know blessed is the man whose sins are forgiven whose transgression is Forgiven his sins are covered and then he says when I kept silent about my sin what I said oh I can just live any way you know I'm as good as any somebody else like I said don't you judge yourself by that right well they do so and so and they're Christian everybody think I don't care what everybody thinks we when it comes down to it we're going to be judged by what God thinks you will not be judged by how you measure up to me or any other person in the church you will be judged how you measure up to Christ who's the word now so sin must be acknowledged verse 5 when I I acknowledge my sin unto thee and my iniquity have I not hid I said I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord and thou forgave us the iniquity of my sins so again you know here comes repentance with acknowledgment I'm a sinner I need Jesus I've been trying to live the Christian life but I can't I keep living this I'm in a vicious cycle all the time over and over and over again well acknowledge I need the Lord I need Jesus and then begin to seek him with all your heart and when you seek him with all your heart that's the day you find him oh I've seen it I've seen it I I've been through enough tricks of the trade through the years I've seen little girls coming to the church and get her eyes on the boy and want this boy and say well I'll tell you what I tell you I'll put away my makeup and my pants and my whatever I I want this boy I I tell you I I I want to I want this boy and to take all her all her clothes and all her lipstick and all her makeup and all her jewelry and everything else and go and bury it when it didn't work up she work out she just dug it up that's not God Godly sorrow you know well I would serve you but I tell you I want this girl I want this boy I want this I I want that I want to hold on to this years ago we used to tell little story as kids you know about a church service say God's everywhere and the preacher preaching God is everywhere God knows what what's in your heart God knows everything God's everywhere one man sitting back there and said oh God don't be B down there in my pocket where my tobacco is you see there was something on the inside that they was holding on to and that's one thing you you say well the holy spirit is is been held from me and why well I tell you he's looking to see that everything has been brought subject to the word is it cannot on the Journey break apart are you with me so he checks everything is this sealed in is that sealed in have you given this to him have you surrendered that to him and he's not going to come in and seal the car as long as there's something loose in your life for this shall everyone that is Godly pray pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found surely in the floods of great water they shall not come nigh unto him so you pray in a time where he may be found because God will not always strive with man there be a time where men will change their mind but it'll be too late not as Esau Hebrews 12 and: 16 see that no one sexually immoral or Godless like Esau who for a single meal sold his inheritance rights as the oldest son verse 16 afterwards as you know he wanted to inherit this blessing and he was rejected he could bring no change of mind though he sought the blessings with tears this is this is he found no place of repentance there comes a point where he crushed the line he throw away the birthright and he comes down to a point that he wants it now I want it now and I want the blessing and yet he seeks it with tears and he can't find it now David's sin he had hit it it was brought out by the prophet Nathan you know sin has a way of working its way itself out of your subconscious and coming to the surface it's like a splinter that gets deep down inside and it's there and it'll fester and fester and it'll eventually come out and and and and and start heading outside the body it don't belong there and sin has a way of working itself out of your subconscious coming to the surface and David admitted it when he was confronted he didn't blame others that's what happens to so many people you know when it comes down to sin well you know they want to blame somebody else for why they are the way they are well it was my upbringing no it's your choice well you know if my parents had done this and this and this I wouldn't be this way no you made a choice well I'm codependent with my dad you know he was a drunk and alcohol this is why I I act like this no it's because of a choice there is none of that don't have Cycles to break in our lives every one of us had to break Cycles where that we lived in a cycle of sin and failure we were raised up that way and the and this Pagan culture that we live in pushes us toward Sin from the time we're a child amen yes but let me tell you you have to break the cycles of of that the break of the cycle of sin but you see David didn't blame others well if IID had a daddy if my daddy would have been at home and he would have raised me right and he would have been an example or if my mama would have been a better example no you have a choice right you can continue that way or you can break that cycle and say I'm not going to be that way I may be their child physically but I am not their child spiritually I'm a child of the most high God and I don't have to serve sin like they did every one of us has to break cycles and like a preacher you know who commit adultery and yet blame others who exposed him yeah I did it but they told on me they were gossipers I did it but you know this is the way Saul was when he sent he didn't repent until it was too late he had sinned he disobeyed the prophet and then he blamed the people then he blamed the prophet and then he blamed the Lord and even Adam did this when he s he said the woman you gave me rather than saying yes I made a conscious deason to do wrong I sinned he said no I tell you but the woman the woman did it and you gave her to me so ultimately God you're the blame for the reason I am now you see that's the way that is we play the blame game why I am the way I am well I can't help it no it's your mountain and you can't move it right so you can't help it but if you surrender your life to God that not by man's might nor by Man's power but by my spirit the Holy Ghost you can move that mountain I don't care how big it's been and how long it's been in your family and it affected you and it affected your father and affected your grandfather and your great grandmother and it comes all the way down through the family tree amen I tell you what when the Holy Ghost comes on the inside of you it gives you a new genealogy Well church people did me wrong and the preachers did me wrong and if they would have done this and if they hadn't done that and if they had spoke to me the way they spoke to me you made a choice and that's way Saul did and that's not repentance see that's still resisting pushing back against God now David knew the word he knew God's precepts but he had no power to live it he said I've taken your word hidden in my heart I've memorized the scriptures I put it as front LS before my eyes I've tied it up on my hands it's on the doorpost as I walk out and he walked out and saw be Sheba and forgot all of that he went around all of his all of his great claims all his profession I want to I want you to turn with me to Psalms 51 and I want you to watch the preface of this so you'll know exactly the setting to the chief musician a Psalm of David when Nathan the prophet came unto him after he had gone into Beba so here's David now and I want you to see how to repent because David here lines us up in the scripture of how to truly repent and he says have mercy on me oh God according to thy loving kindness according to the multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out my transgressions now he's not asking for justice he is asking for Mercy you know he said blot out my transgressions and then he says in verse two Wash Me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for I acknowledge my transgression and my sin is ever before me here's David I'm wrong I need a savior I need Mercy I'm not asking for justice am I'm not getting for what I deserve I deserve to go to hell well if that woman hadn't went out and washed that day if she hadn't if she hadn't if she hadn't David is not blaming anybody else he is looking right here and he's saying have mercy on me oh God according to your loving kindness amen according the multitude of your Tender Mercies Blood Out My transgressions Wash Me thoroughly from my iniquity cleans me from my sin for I acknowledge my transgression and my sin is ever before me I realize I'm wrong there no more covering it up he had tried he had tried and you can cover it up and your sins will find you out you can do it in every sneaky way you can but it's going to come to surface sin your sins will find you out and this is exactly this is what David did he did everything he could to covered up he SS and he calls to the man her husband and tries to get him go sleep with his wife he won't do it then he goes and gets him drunk he can't get him to do it then you know he's trying to cover it up and finally he sends a note B said get him killed right I've got to hide my transgression you see that's what people do they try to hide hide it let me tell you you said don't tell nobody let me tell you it's going to come out you can't hide it all the same let me let me just you all of this and and and I want to get something to you you can repent of sins but whatever you s you're going to reap be not deceived God is Not mocked whatever you s you're going to reap when you do wrong you're going to reap you plant seed you're going to reap a harvest it'll come up it'll come up in your children here here later on David's own son took David's wies and in and David did that in secret he did it from the Housetop with David's own wives they're on the housetop come on the sin never left his house because of his sin you see you you'll reap it in your kids you'll reap it in your grandkids and there's only one way to stop bringing forth a crop of evil out of your life quit planting [Applause] it quit sewing that seed and every time you see it come up plow it up amen get it covered over with the blood amen what is it quit it and I'll tell you what eventually you're going to have more when you plant the right seed you're going to have more good seed than you have bad seed and it won't be long friend people will not be looking at a a field of tears but they'll see a field of weed amen because you're a gardener you're going to keep any of those old seeds from coming up every time you see it come up you pluck it out and throw it out and say no that's not in my [Applause] garden now you have to acknowledge your transgression my sin is be ever before me against thee watch now I want you to watch this verse against thee thee only have I sinned now he wasn't denying that he had hurt his family he wasn't denying that he' hurt Israel he wasn't denying that that that's not he was doing but he was recognizing God I have sinned against you I've done evil in th sight and I'm telling you this so that you can be justified when you speak and you can be clear when you judge I I sinned against you you see people don't realize the sin that they do and not just sin it's something against God that's why they're been smear on the church that's why I be smear on the name of Jesus Christ because your sin is against God and he goes on and says look I was shapen in iniquity and my sin in sin that my mother conceived me I I've been a sinner since I was born and you look you behold truth you desire truth in the inward Parts in the hid in the hidden part th said make me to know wisdom and he says Purge me with hisp and I shall be clean wash me and I will be whiter than snow and that let me tell you that's the only way that you can ever get clean is come to Jesus amen because can a leop cleans it spot the more he licks it the brighter the spots right and as a sinner you can't you cannot fix yourself up come on the more you lick it the worse it gets the more you groom it the worse he gets somebody with me amen but look here again what what was it you was me and I'll be clean you purge me and I'll be whiter than snow and let me give you a real truth this morning even if your sins are as Scarlet they shall be white as snow though they be red like Crimson amen they shall be white as wool as far as the East is from the West I'll remove your sins from you your sins and iniquities I will remember no more Hallelujah this is the word this is what he'll do he'll take your sins when you really repent and he'll put them in the sea of his forgetfulness Hallelujah this God cannot only forgive he can forget your sins amen because sin will never be attributed to your new life that's who you was as a sinner but now born again I'm a Son of God and as a Son of God I've never did it in the first [Applause] place Purge me with hiss of I shall be clean wash me and I'll be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken May Rejoice hide thy face from my sin and blood out all my iniquities create in me a clean heart oh God renew a right Spirit In Me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me what watch now I I want you to see something I want you to see something here now first of all remember David's not converted David don't have the Holy Ghost but when he says take not the Holy Spirit from me he's remembering sa amen because when Saul departed from the things of God an evil spirit came to torment him and David knew the madness the insanity the hatred come on David knew all of these things that pled Saul and drove him into in into to hate and Des spies and kill and murder and David said God don't take your anointing off of my life I don't want to turn out to be like Saul Saul would not repent Saul would blame others Paul Saul would not would would not admit his wrong he he continued right on and and what was it an evil spirit came from the presence of God another God whether God allowed an evil spirit to come and torment the man and do you know even that's God's mercy stop for a minute even Saul was a predestinated seed but he couldn't do right because without Christ without the Holy Ghost he couldn't live it are you keying in so Saul David knew now watch I mean Saul Saul would would go and and he would see Samuel come up that old prophet and he would come up and he said this day you'll be with me so it showed that he was he was even a saved man would be gathered with Samuel and and and and the seed of Abraham in the bosom of Abraham he was a predestinated seed but you see the spirit wasn't given yet to make that seed do right he didn't have the water of the spirit to germinate it and so he says clean create in me a clean heart renew a right Spirit In Me cast me not away from thy presence take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore to me the joy of thy salvation remember salvation isn't our own doing salvation is of the Lord thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit now I want you to get something here put up verse 16 God doesn't want worship from a sinner he wants repentance from a sinner you're up here oh how I love Jesus you don't love Jesus I said you don't love [Music] Jesus still a sinner if you love me keep my Commandments he doesn't want worship from you he wants repentance from you you up there singing oh I want to see him you don't want to see him that's the last person you want to to see sin all over your life doing evil doing wrong you don't want to see him God doesn't want worship from a sinner he wants repentance from a sinner and when you repent then you can worship amen cuz God does not accept worship from a polluted heart it can only come from a cleansed heart look at verse 16 for thou desirest no sacrifice or else I would give it thou Delight us not in burnt offering oh no that's not what you want you aren want me to to to bring worship you ain't wanting fancy prayers you a want me to go through rituals that's not what you want God the sacrifice you're looking for is a broken Spirit a broken and a contrite heart oh God thou will not despise amen you see it takes coming to oneself come into your senses you see the prodical son was always a son going out and even eating pig Swap and sell you know giving up his his whole attitude toward his father and his whole life that he lived that never made him not a son amen and he when he came to himself he said how many hearts Servants of my father have bread enough and Des spare and I perish with Hunger Luke 15:18 he says I will arise and go to my father and will say to him father I have sinned against heaven and before thee you see here again he's approaching him as a prodal and he's coming back he said I've been a sinner right I'm wrong I don't deserve anything you've got I don't deserve Heaven I don't deserve forgiveness if I got what I deserve I'd go to hell but oh God how many how many Lord servants look at verse 19 I'm no no longer worthy to be called thy son just make me as a hired servant and God said no I I don't want you as a hired servant you're my son I want to restore The Headstone in your life I want to cap you off with deity that's what you've been waiting on you know all of this you you've wasted it how many years but I'm not want to make you a servant I'm not want to make you a cast away I want to bring you in as a son amen and when he was away a far off his father saw him had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him amen the songwriter said the only time God Ran he didn't run from danger he didn't run from enemies he didn't run from calamities but I tell you that day when he saw his son and he saw him coming a long ways off amen that day he ran to him I tell you if you make a step towards God God will start ready toward you when the moment you say God I need you against and against thee only have I sined and I need a savior forgive me oh God I quit blaming I am what I am and I start saying Lord because I did this real Godly sorrow makes it where you'll make it right with the neighbors amen as brother Bram said we need an oldfashioned Revival that we used to have down the country where they lay on their face all night long not to carry on but a real Godly sorrow brother brandom in his holy ghost series he said now what we're going to do we're having this Holy Ghost Revival he had been he had been talking about it for months he was telling out in his campaigns I'm going back to my Baptist Tabernacle and I'm going to tell him you must receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost though you have believed though you were baptized you are adhering the doctrines that you were receiving truths you've got to get the Holy Ghost and he has a whole series that he preaches and he says I tell you what I want you to do said I tell you what I want you we're we're going to have homes open where people can come and pray we're going to have the church open where people come and pray we're going to have people ministers come and lay members come and those that are interested in other salvation and come and pray with him and it and if it takes he says all the way from and here I think it's the 15th of December all the way to New Years if it takes you that long to die die out and that's where the shortcomings coming even around the message we wanted just a quick fix a microwave Holy Ghost we just come to the Altar and have preachers pray for you you and go back and we're there and never change die out empty out look at your life and say oh God I must have a change and when you get desperate that's when God will meet you he will meet a desperate soul and he says oldfashioned Revival like we used to have down in the country where they lay on their face all night long not to carry on but when real Godly sorrow not go back to altar not not go back to to The Altar and and stay but get out go out then and make it right with the neighbors that they had made it wrong with get it straightened up that's right you know it's scorching but it's good it'll help you you know that my friend you see it brings a Godly sorrow and key to the door I believe repentance Godly sorrow means turn around repent means turn around go back you missed the mark start over again do that first and your baptism in water is only an outr profession of something that's been done the inside of you that you've accepted Christ as your savior you see this lack of repentance is what caused God to hate the worship in the days of Isaiah he said your sacrifices and your solemn Feast they are an Abomination to me they are a stench in my nostrils because you are coming without sincerity you're coming about tradition this is what we do it was a ritual or taking a you know a form of taking an animal for an offer never got anything out of it because he never put nothing in it yet he was obeying the commission of God by his word but he didn't come in the real meaning of his word he was obeying as far as fundamentally he obeyed but sincerely he didn't obey it therefore it was just a ritual following a tradition brother Bram told us he said you know he said I hadn't got anything against all the denomination but you're losing that sincerity that something should have in your worship and it just becomes a family tradition he goes and makes his offering of sin takes the communion just takes it anyway smoking drinking running with somebody else's wife women acting any way go take communion when you realize the Bible said if a man eats and drinks of this Blood unworthy he's guilty of the body and blood of the Lord we've lost the sincerity there's something wrong with us that's the way you approach God it isn't by approaching and say well I'll tell you what how did you say to dress how did you say where where where what parts can we wear jewelry on what what what what can we uh you know how long is long you know how do we dress what do we do how that's only conforming listen we had rules of the goat show when you went into the show ring you wore all right all white took your goats out and paraded it around but you were required a uniform I want you to know you can put on a uniform of a Believer and not be a believer and just be showing goats all around are you with me amen but let me tell you it isn't what you can put on it's what you receive in and then that starts living out it ain't a it ain't a black bird putting a peacock feathers in him and say I'm a peacock it's becoming born again the nature Chang and from the inside out comes a nature but when you see worldliness and sin and cutting hair and painting coming out against the word it shows the holy spirit is not there it's a direct evidence the spirit of God is missing I want you to come with me to close we're coming to communion now communion is a test in the Bible if a woman was accused of her husband of unfaithfulness he would take her before the priest and there would be a test of jealousy this woman would have to swear that she had not been unfaithful and then she would have to take water mixed with the dirt of the Holy place and eat it let loose her hair it was a test of jealousy and if she had done wrong it would swell in her belly if she had transgressed the marage Covenant it would show up when we come to communion it's a showdown it's not something to be taken flippantly but seriously my sins are of the blood things I've done wrong that bitterness brother Timothy preached about I went and straightened it up those things that's in my life little things I've left undone I'm coming now to the table because it's the test of jealousy if you've ate this bread and drink of this cup unworthily you eat and drink damnation to yourself because you didn't discern we wasn't playing Church you didn't discern this was the Lord's body and you've been lying and because of this Paul said many are sick and weakly among you and some even are dead because you didn't recognize the sincerity of this moment we're going to be coming to the table of the Lord and you examine your life let the musicians come right now search me oh God know my heart I pray try me oh savior know my thoughts if you know there's things in your life I want you to make it right right now in these moments this is why the Bible said when we come together Terry wait for one another I want you just to wait in these [Music] moments and I want you to examine your life and say Lord I'm coming I'm going to take the test of jealousy [Music] if I've been untrue to you I know I could be eating and drinking damnation to myself cuz I didn't discern this is the Lord's body and in your repentance there's something that pricked your heart this morning I want you to go make that [Music] right I don't care if it takes the hide off your back I don't care if it's like Z Zach just had to do where he said Lord where I've stole from others where I've taken from others where I've taken advantage of others I'll pay it back tfold I'll do whatever is necessary because why he want this my life right before God now it's not in works of righteousness we've done but it's through the blood but when the blood touches your life it causes you to straighten up and live right no more do you act like the pig you once lived the life you once lived in the flesh now you will live it by the faith of the son of God as brother Timothy comes to lead some songs we'll just take these few moments to wait say search me oh God know my heart today try me oh savior know my thoughts I [Music] pray I pray see there be some weed way in me sin and save sing that again search me oh God search me oh God and know my heart today try oh say know my thoughts I pray see there be [Music] some wed way in me from
