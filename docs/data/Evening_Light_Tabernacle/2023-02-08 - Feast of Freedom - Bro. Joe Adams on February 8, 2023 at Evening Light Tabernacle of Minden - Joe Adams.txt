worry of what others may think father God I can backtrack my life and surely Lord I have a reason have a joy in my heart there's a shadow of the King on the inside God I was heading one way but now I'm headed completely different direction Lord many here tonight Lord they were heading a different road but father you came by and you stepped on the scene father you turned their hearts and their lives around and Lord we can sing it tonight mighty mighty you are holy you are unworthy you are o God oh and that's what we want to do we never want to be caught on the sidelines not worshiping our Lord but father may you find our worship pleasing and our Our Praise may it be a a sweet smelling Savor in our nostrils tonight oh God Lord as we commit this service now to you we ask the Lord you'll anoint the lips of the speaker in the ears of the hearer father those on the stream and those present God may we just cultivate an atmosphere of worship tonight and just allow the Holy Spirit as we already fill him him here tonight Lord just to have your way father we give you of ourselves Lord our time our gifts our talents father we ask that you speak to us tonight we ask it in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles tonight we're going to look in Leviticus look here in Leviticus and we're going to Leviticus 23 and we'll start at verse 1. just going to read the first three scriptures or the three three scriptures here then we'll have you be seated and said the Lord's spake unto Moses saying speaking to the children of Israel and say unto them concerning the Feast of the Lord which you shall Proclaim to be holy convocations even these are my Feasts six days shall work be done but on the seventh day is the Sabbath of rest a holy convocation you shall do no work therein it is the day of Sabbath of the Lord and all your dwellings God bless you you can have your seats this evening and I want to take just for a topic tonight Feast of freedom you said well brother I don't find that in the Bible you're exactly right but that's okay Feast of Freedom this word Feast here that we picked up on and uh the second verse here actually means a properly and an appointment is a fixed time an appointed time or season specifically a festival so I want you to clue in here so this is a feast of freedom and the word Festival is a day or a period of Celebration typically a religious commemoration a lot of times people want to put things over us as Christians and and we're afraid to worship freedom to let go free to allow the spirit to move even here locally there's some times that we come and some of us and I'm not here to criticize tonight but you bring a wet blanket with you to the house of God and you need to take the wet blanket dried out and then come and fan the fires so we find here though that when we look through Leviticus 23 we find that there are seven feasts that are mentioned there is the Feast of Passover which is the Haggadah which is actually the Feast of freedom that's where we get the the title tonight is the Feast of Freedom see the Passover is a Jewish feast or a Jewish Festival or a Jewish celebration of their freedoms it was celebrated about the same time as Easter and it lasts typically seven to eight days and during the Passover Jews around the world they remembered their freedom from slavery in Egypt notice they're not in Egypt anymore but they recall the time that they were once slaves and if there was ever a people that should be able to recall a time that you were once saved but now you're no longer a slave and what does it do it causes a festivity it causes a celebration a celebration of worship a celebration of Praise acceleration of adoration you're not concerned about the critics you're not concerned about the Pharaohs you're not concerned about the murmurs or the complainers why because you are no longer in Egypt but we are free and so this is the committation that we are no longer held by man-made ideas we're no longer held by sin's changed but we have been made free by the blood of Jesus Christ it is a feast of freedom a celebration of freedom a celebration of your liberties think about brother Philip nine years he's been a born-again believer nine years some of you a lot longer but don't you ever forget that day don't you ever forget that day when he came and so sweetly wiped all your sins away and don't forget that day when you strove and you tried it and you come through justification and you come through the process of a sanctification but one day of that day that important day he came down to filled your life with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you want to talk about a celebration you want to talk about you can't hold yourself you don't have the power within your own Humanity to keep yourself but he sent you down the Holy Ghost for one purpose is to keep you notice we find that there's a feast of unleavened bread there's a feast of the first fruits in the Feast of Weeks and the Feast of trumpets and the Feast of atonement and the feasts of boost or the Feast of Tabernacles seven Feasts God thought so much about these that he caused a celebration yeah now some of you how many of you been watching The Chosen series raise your hands up good and high you know the Jews know how to have a celebration they're not afraid of what others are thinking you'll see them dancing around in a circle or you see them you know we hear about the Sabbat and we hear about this and the Sabbath and all these other things the Shabbat and all this and yet they experience they're not worried about the criticizers they're not worried about those that murmur and complain why because they are bound to the law and there was a set law there that on this certain time at this certain day at this certain hour you are to do a feast you ought to remember that you're no longer in Egypt Penny Lord you were the held there 400 years but you're not there today let me tell you you got to remember too church that you're no longer in sin those things that the devil's trying to hold over you he's trying to put the memory of you yesterday until you're today but all you got to do is remember that God had made a way and you need to begin to celebrate what God has done for you come to the house of God with the exuberation I'm here to worship I'm no longer in Chains I'm no longer in fact but I have been made free by the blessings of almighty God see the major theme of these feasts is gratitude see an ungrateful heart is an unfeeling heart an ungrateful heart is an unloving heart an ungrateful heart is an unbelieving heart an ungrateful heart is a disobedient heart and they had these set Feasts and it was to be grateful and I'm no longer in bondage to be grateful for what God has done and what God will do if he was God for you yesterday he's got for you today and he'll be God for you tomorrow don't worry about what you're facing don't worry about because you don't have the answers God will provide the answer at the right season at the right time just celebrate with God celebrate what he's done for you trust in the Lord lean not to your own understanding but in all thy ways trust him he will lead you he will guide you he will protect you he will heal you he will deliver you and he will fill you with the Holy Ghost and give you a reason to shout a reason to celebrate you know brother Brandon would tell us that the believer the Christians should be the happiest people on the Earth so we're gonna put a sign on the door we ain't really gonna do that I'm just telling you smile when you come in smile when you worship smile when you're seated say Amen it's okay but we find an ungrateful heart is a heart that can't feel an ungrateful heart gets covered up with bitterness and grudges and complexes and doubts and all these other different things an ungrateful heart because if you're not grateful to God for what he's done for you in your life and you're afraid to testify what he's done oh my God I don't have no clowns but testifying where I was at and where God has done for me nor do these brothers up here and not an ordered some of you but was he an ungrateful heart is a heart that'll get smutted up because it doesn't remember where they were and doesn't remember the life that they once lived it doesn't remember that they needed a savior but notice now we're going to look here just for a little bit we're going to delve off into Leviticus just for a little bit you know I'm not a teacher so don't worry Leviticus 23 and verse 4 and these are the feast festivals I want you to get so when we think about facing the sound we think about a seven-course meal don't we like dinner on the grounds man there's all kind of food we ain't talking about that kind of feast though that is prepared with them but it's a celebration so I want you to think in your mind as I'm preaching this this evening rather when we bring the word Feast out think of a festivity think of a celebration some of you are holding on for Chronicles let me tell you I begin to celebrate right now I have to get to worship right now I begin to think in God right now why it may not appear that they're there but you got a promise laying in the word that day and their offspring shall be there I begin to celebrate brother Aaron I begin to praise God I begin to call the fatigue of the feast and give a fatty calf and invite those that come and worship with you and praise God with you notice now these are the feasts of the Lord even holy convocations which you shall Proclaim in their seasons in the 14th day of the first month and even is the Lord's Passover the Feast of Freedom it starts it starts with freedom it all starts with freedom notice now and on the 15th day of the same month is the Feast of unleavened bread unto the Lord seven days you must eat unleavened bread notice now brother Brandon would pick up and he was on God's only provided place of worship he would tell us seven days eat 11 breads no leaven shall be found amongst the bride no word added nothing no nothing remember one word caused every death that's in the Earth every illegitimate child was born because of Eve the first church the bride now the first Adam she doubted God's word and accepted a denominational or an intellectual or a school of exceptions of it because it was reasoned out so we find now through seven Church ages there was no mixing of man's idea in the word so we're to eat unleavened bread not man's idea but the God's holy word keep it pure keep it clean keep it away from man's touching it and the Ambassador dies in it but we got to keep the word holy and he said for seven days seven Church ages and that's why we're here in the final age with the pure word with the pure message and we're rejoicing in a pure Liberty where it Christ has made us free we dropped down the Leviticus 23 and verse 9. and the Lord speaking to Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them notice not if but when you be coming to the land which I give unto you and ye shall reap the Harvest thereof then you shall bring a Sheaf and this is a heap or a measure are the first fruits of your Harvest unto the priest and he shall wave the Sheep before the Lord to be accepted for you on the moral after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it notice the Sheaf could not be presented until they got into the land see some of us and we're not we're not going to criticize your jump on your shelf because that's what we believe for we're going to believe for your jump and your Shadow and your real experience but he's noticed here they could not present the sheep or the wave offering until they came into the land until they planted the seed of the crop and then they took the first fruits of it and they took it to the priest and he would wave it over the congregation see God established his Feast he established it with the memorial uh that they have come out of Egypt and this is just the first fruits of what God is going to do for them in the land but it all starts taking place around they had to leave come on somebody some of you need to leave some of those dead pots that you're in some of you stuck in depression some of you stuck in grudges and bitterness and all these other things some of you are stuck there some of you need to get up and pack out and leave the Egypt that you're in and realize God has called you to be free some of you men need to lead that pornography site and realize you have been made free tonight leave it behind you're being called out in the freeze of the first fruits was a memorial that you no longer in Egypt you have been caught and this is the first fruits of the land and what did God do on the day of Pentecost God poured down the Holy Ghost as the first fruits that there was going to be more coming this is only the beginning but I've got more for you and it's going to be a harvest at the end of the road see God established this feast he wanted to be a time of Celebration he didn't expect him to come dragging in well my goodness his church today no they were excited they're in a new land they're in a promising oh my there's untapped resources in this land notice they come out of Egypt they come out of the hardships they come out from under the rule of the taskmasters they come into a land that God had promised and the wave sheep brother bran will tell us the way she is the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost it is the first fruits oh my church God thought so much of it Daddy he established a time of celebration around it and people don't want us to get excited when we get the Holy Ghost oh my they want you to be all starchy and I see informal and indignant and all this other kind of stuff you get to sit there and just shake your head this is church you can't hear nothing but the preacher no you're out you're free that's a celeb that's something to celebrate about how many you've ever been to jail oh don't put your hand up thank you brother Jackson got one of my car you know I went to jail before now just bear with me I know where I'm going here somebody like oh how long ago was that it wasn't last week but before I got saved I was down in New Orleans we all familiar in New Orleans about Fat Tuesday it was about that time I was down there and I was putting on a good drunk I was hanging out with a bunch of college friends and we thought we'd go down and take in Mardi Gras dumb mistake but I didn't have me about two or three of these hurricanes big drink I'm telling you a whole lot you don't need to know but anyway so I you know this lady comes by she was a lady but she was a man on a she was really uh she was a Butch on a horse but Timmy should come riding by she bumped me I was like hey watch that horse she was an officer but I was drunk it didn't matter and so I was like hey and I patted the horse she said don't touch that horse I'm like okay man and I said a few Choice words with that you can't believe it I know so anyway she come after me with that horse and she caught me and picked me up like this and I was on my tiptoes hey she was more than a man she had me rung up she was on Top Cops the next week if y'all know what that is don't look it up and she was there so anyway they hauled me down to the Paddy Wagon brother Jackson to the padded wagon and they beat me and they kicked me and and they punched me and they chunked me in that little Paddy Wagon with one other guy it was dark and I was drunk and I was scared to death so they take me to the New Orleans Police Department brother Tim I was like oh Lord but thankfully they didn't put me behind bars I sat out just a spot like this there's people all over the place there was lonely not lonely they were homeless people there was uh murderers there was child molesters there was drag queens there was all kind of sites in the New Orleans Police Department in Mardi Gras and so they brought in a guy he had just killed his wife and so there was another college guy behind he was right there next to me he was from Georgia Tech and I said hey buddy so you watch my back I'll watch your back he said deal well his back got cleared a lot sooner than mine he got out of there and I was like oh now I'm here by myself and my friends they went back to Baton Rouge and left me there and I'm like no you ain't leaving me here see that's what I'm trying to tell you tonight they left me in an unforsaken place an ungodly place and even though I was in a drunken stupor I realized I don't ever want to come back to this I don't ever want to come to this place ever again there's all sorts of life and what am I telling you that for because if you've ever been in bondage then you've ever been released from it you'll know daggone good and well that you don't want to go back to that you don't want to go back to that life you don't want to go back to that place and because God had broke the chain off of it and now you are free every day I never been to jail again it cured me not too long after that like I say praise the Lord I didn't know but he wanted me to go to jail so I could tell you that testimony and service tonight God has a sense of humor really that ain't why he did it but nevertheless so now we go down Feast of Weeks Leviticus 23 and verse 15 and you shall count unto you from the morrow after the Sabbath from the day that you have brought the sheep of the wave offering seven sabbaths shall be complete even unto the morrow after the seventh Sabbath shout your number 50 days and you shall offer a new meat offering unto the Lord so the first fruits was poured out on the church seventh Sabbath ago or seven Church ages ago see that was the first fruits declaring that there's coming a harvest there's coming a time that there'll be more that comes to maturity and see we're not in the day of the first fruits we're in the day of the Pentecostal feast see the Feast of Weeks is also called The Feast of Pentecost because it was 50 days after the Sabbath it was 50 days after the Passover excuse me so we're not living in a time where God is first now pouring out the Holy Ghost but we're living in a day when God is coming to harvest the bride God is coming to draw out a bride it's the time we're living in a time of Freedom if there are anybody on the place of the earth that should be free and declare their freedom should be the Bride of Jesus Christ tonight we should be the most happiest people that there is in all the land but brother Joe you don't know what I'm going through I know I don't know what you're going through and I know that it's heavy and I know that it's real but I also know you're not where you used to be I know that you're not in sin anymore you're not in denominational change anymore God has released you so no matter where you are God is in control God is leading you God is guiding you and you're free so you might as well worship you can't change tomorrow to worship God tonight [Applause] notice that we find here in Deuteronomy 16 and verse 9. we're going to look at the Feast of Weeks from a different aspect here seven weeks shall thou number unto thee and begin to number the seven weeks from such a time as thou begin us to put the sickle to the corn and thou shall keep the Feast of Weeks unto the Lord thy God with the tribute of a free will offering of thy hand which thou shall give unto the Lord thy God according as the Lord thy God had blessed thee and thou shall rejoice oh you mean I gotta rejoice that's what it says thou shall rejoice you mean it's okay yeah we got word we got a promise we got inscription for it notice this word Rejoice means to be glad to be joyful to be full of cheer to brighten up brighten up to be Gleason y'all how many of y'all like to be around negative people don't nobody raise your hand or shake your head you're like no negative people bring you down but here we're promised here we sit down shall rejoice before the Lord Thou shalt be happy before the Lord thou shall be free before the Lord notice now and thou notice who all is supposed to be this way who all is going to Rejoice see thy son thy daughter thy man's servant thy maid servant the levite that's within thine Gates The Strangers let me tell you and the fatherless and the Widow that are among you in the place which the Lord thy God has chosen this place to put his name there everybody should Rejoice let me tell you may have came here heavy tonight but that doesn't give you an excuse not to Rejoice you should rejoice in the Lord and that everything that has breath praise ye the Lord notice now in verse 16 and thou shall remember here's where we're clueing in on thou shall remember that thou was a bondman in Egypt thou was Obama that's what you were that's not what you are tonight Church you were in bondage but today you're free you weren't seeing but today you've been liberated you did have those thoughts but today those thoughts are free from your mind see you are a bondman you were once held in sin and chains and shackles the praved humanity man's ideas man dogmas man-made Creeds lives of the enemy complexes bitterness grudges depression tormenting spirits but you are not in Egypt anymore you're not in Egypt you're not a bondman anymore so quit acting like it quit acting like it take that slave mentality out of your mind and put it under your feet tonight because you're no longer a Slave notice now so that's all we're going to look at in Leviticus tonight because we could go on and on and on but we have a great teacher back here that can bring the troops out of all that but we're going to look here and the Bible will tell us the Bible the prophet of God will tell us let me go back in the Feast of the trumpets he said now the Jews have been blinded waiting all this time while the Pentecostal first fruits have been poured out upon the church see and we come down through the martyr's age down through the reformer's age and now the calling out age three sections Same Spirit like father son the Holy Ghost same one but seven Church ages is being seven sabbaths exactly seven and he says now when he's revealed himself as a Son of God he's been revealing it to the church and the baptism of the Holy Ghost down through the ages in the Pentecostal agency just keep getting more and more justification under Luther sanctification under Wesley and the baptism on the Holy Ghost but we find under the Sixth Seal when The Sixth Seal opened there was persecution struck the Jews and it struck them in a literal sense but it strikes Us in an ecclesiastical manner anybody can say Amen to that right some people are waiting on the squeeze I'm like what are you waiting for we got it it's here look around get your head out of the sand with the squeeze his own church it's going Hometown for the bride we ain't waiting on the squeeze we we're being squeezed right now we're being squeezed into an atmosphere we don't want to be here anymore [Applause] we notice now the bride is persecuted from an ecclesiastical standpoint she's attacked for her stand for the word she's attacked for where she stands on this word notice many have attacked this word many have attacked our message many have defected away from it and their sole purpose now they're so full of Venom they're so full of animosity and all they want to do is destroy the effects of this message let me tell you what the effects of this message will do it'll take a dirty heart and it'll clean it it'll take a man who's Bound for hell and put him on the road to Heaven I'll tell you what this message has done it'll clean my life it gave me a Godly wife it gave me a great family he'd give me a wonderful Church it didn't be great friends I'll tell you what it'll do it'll do more for you than all that bickering all that backbody all that fussing all that grudging all that bitterness it'll do it for you it'll save you up that's what she's going to do for you you want to criticize that go ahead I'm testimony tonight that this message works I wasn't born into it but it was born into me oh my they want to criticize but this bride will withstand every attack she's gonna weather every accusation say what you want I'm not looking at you my eyes are focused on Christ notice she's been criticized she's been made fun of she's been chastised by many for standing for the full word of God not just that intellectual understanding but the full word she's been called fanatic I know none of you are fanatical she's been called Holy Roller she's been labeled Pentecostal with a derogatory implementation no matter the attack though she's not turning back this means for there and did such a great job last week preaching on Total War bring your attack we ain't turning back we're staying with this word we're staying with this message we're not going to go off on man's idea we're not going off on some fairy tale Doctrine we are staying right here on thus saith the Lord well there's a jump in the Bible we're going to jump where there's a shout in the word and the shadow of the king is in the camp and we got something to shout about we're gonna throw our hands up and we're going to shout when you cross through the Red Sea and you realize you're no longer in sin you can grab your tambourine Mary and you can have yourself a tambourine dance a jubilee dance a red sequel Hallelujah you can cross the Red Sea again and realize all your tax Master each and every one that has ever lied to you that ever deceived you that ever tried to distribute your your joy away they're dead in the sea and you are free don't let somebody quieten your praise see the attack on the church today is no different than it was when they left Egypt you notice they had some of their own Kindred complaining and murmuring Moses you brought us out here Moses we don't have enough to eat Moses we don't have nothing to dream Moses Moses Moses brother Tim how would you feel if everybody in here came to you each and every day my God that'd be awful you may resign Moses was stuck he was God's leader to bring him out and now they want to complain Moses you take too much on yourself Moses Moses Moses and that's what we find today some of those would rather go back and live in bondage than live in Freedom then suffer a few hardships along the way before they got to the promised land and some look being a Christian is not a flowery bed of ease church we know we've all had our struggles and we're all going to face more struggles but the end goal is what we're pointed to and just as sure as God brought a bride out of Egypt and took her into a promised land and those that came out they wasn't hindered by the critics they wasn't hindered by all those and spoke evil and how she worshiped and how she danced there's going to be a bride called out of this hour out of this generation out of this age that she ain't looking at what the critics say they can get on YouTube they can get on whatever whatever social media they want to get on they can blast this church they can criticize us for being too loud they can criticize us for being too emotional they can criticize us for being too free but I'm telling you you can never be free enough and you might as well start enjoying it I don't care what the critics say I'll dance for the Lord if he wants me to I'll shout amen because why I know that I'm not in bondage anymore I know that I've been set free and the shackles of sin have been stripped off my life my brother Joe dude I really gotta act that way do we really got to do that we all have no new we don't all have to do that because we're not all alike right some of us are more enthusiastic than others some of us let's just be honest some of us are more free than others if you can ever get this thing right here free then these get free these get free that gets free oh but you got to release this thing from the prison that you put it here the prison of your doubts the prison what other is going to think about you the prison of oh you got your fears you got oh you did this so you can't worship no the Bible would tell us or the prophet God will tell us that we fall every day all that comes short of the glory of God but we don't just rest on this this thing here has got to be free and Paul said I Die daily he died to this thinking he died to his Humanity he died to his thoughts he died to his upbringing he died to his inner Lake he died so that he can be free and church we gotta die so that we can be free to yourself die to your own ideas die to your complexes tonight that's all those things so you can experience the Feast of freedom there's a feast you don't want to miss oh my notice Mary Magdalene she came to a a feast and there was Jesus sitting there with dirty feet and a Pharisees oh they were just complaining murmuring look at her what's he gonna do is he going to condemn her did he jerk his foot back no he didn't some of you need to come on up to the feet start washing he won't jerk his feet back he enjoys it notice what the prophet of God will tell us no Jesus don't do things that way no no he never pulled his foot back oh he sat right still and watched her she was doing for him what they've ought to done now here's a warning to the critics and you be careful calling somebody a Holy Roller who's doing what you ought to have done don't you think you're just a little better than they are now so he's saying don't you be guilty of calling somebody a Holy Roller criticizing the youth because they get a little excitable and they run and they dance and they shout when they're moving other Spirit goes and sometimes it's in the flesh I did not walk up here in my spirit I walked out here in my flesh so you got to get in the flesh before the spirit can come so sometimes some of y'all need to get in the flesh loosen up those old joints a little bit so the spirit can come and start offering up a god of sacrifice of praise he ain't gonna pull his foot back he's waiting he's desire to be worshiped he's designed your sacrifice of praise she knew what others were thinking about her but she ignored the critics she ignored the Pharisees she ignored everything but see the prophet of God say if these big starches won't worship God God will pull out of you poor people he will get somebody to do it he will call Sinners and harlots from the streets somebody is going to worship God I'm going to tell you God will call a backslider back tonight he'll call the prodigals back tonight he'll call Sinners off the street tonight he'll call the waiver tonight he'll come the heart and say somebody is going to worship God they ain't gonna worship because oh I grew up in a message church or I grew up in a Christian home no they're worshiping because they are free they were once held by sin they were headed to a devil's hell and a sinner's grave but almighty God came by and broke the Chase and it cleared the dead and now they are free he said I've seen jumping spells I've seen your spells but there was nobody hurt mountains rung out sun went down everything took place but there was nobody hurt well my goodness if ain't nobody getting hurt let's just jump in we got nothing to worry about right notice now I've seen meetings where the power of God was revealed to the people that they were free from the world the things of the world and the joy of the Lord filled the congregation they stood and they screamed and they cried and they shouted to the top of their voice for the glory of God I never did see anything disorderly they was always right in order and hence the reason because they had recognized that their name that had been written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world I'm afraid to reason some of us ain't got no joy we ain't looking over finding our name come on Church brother Tim's been preaching we are the people of the open book for hunting Services if you ain't looked over and saw your name it's your own fault John said when I saw my name when that book became open he looked over and saw his name he said everything in heaven everything below everything in this oh Hallelujah everything heard I John worshiping what because John realized that Santa scene was paid he was going to hell but he was going to heaven he knew he had passed from Death unto life and now he was free he was not going to be with the condemned he was not going to be punished for his evil Deeds let me tell you that's worth shouting about that's worth having a feast a celebration and see John notice I want you to notice this I don't know if you've ever noticed it maybe you have or not but notice where John was notice John's congregation let me say his audience when John got a little liberated them joints got loose tongue got loose he got filled with simulation because he saw his name there he saw that the sin that has been cleared notice John was so happy he didn't just sit quietly how some of them want us to do we got the revealed word we just need to be reverent John was sitting or may I say standing in the presence of the one who sat on the throne okay John was also in the presence of a strong angel John was in the presence of four beasts and in the midst of the Four and Twenty elders and John was in the presence of a lamb who had been slain before the foundation of the world if John could sit in front of such an audience's act and shout and praise God and rejoice because now he is free what about even tonight Tabernacle what about the bride worldwide let me tell you what an audience to worship under the Lamb of God the one who paid the price the one who cleared your debt and said now you are free you're no longer held in Chains you're no longer guilty of those things I cleared the debt and shall begin to Rejoice y'all began to dance y'all begin to shout oh Hallelujah everything hurts John go ahead and criticize YouTube I don't care I done saw my name Mama didn't put me there daddy didn't put me there my pastor didn't put me there the favorite preacher didn't put my name there but the Lamb on Hallelujah the lamb put my name there hit the left put my name there you can't take it out you can't take it out you can't take that nothing can remove by that whatever you're free tonight got free tonight but does he struck it out he stuck it all tonight and John is a type excuse me John's a type of the Bride how am I and this Vibe refuses to be shamed into thinking that her excitement and her emotion that comes from the Holy Ghost is wrong well God don't do those things anymore too late he does here now he may not with you maybe you ain't where you need to be but he works here he works here oh we this bride refuses to back up she refuses to back down she refuses to be she's going to stand with the Lord she's going to stand on her stance that he is the same yesterday today and forever in the same size the same Wonders that he did yesterday he's the same God today she refuses to back down on preaching the full word of God with signs and wonders of Miracles following she refuses to be in her compromise let me just say it like this she will preach the message she will manifest the fruits of the spirit she will continue to have prayer lives so people can get delivered she will continue to have altar calls so some sinner can weep their way to Calvary they can come to Christ and know him and be freed from the dead of sin she will worship God in the way that they want to call heresy she's not worried about it notice now she will not be back in bondage again never again she has received a token do you know that slogan never again originated a long time ago in the it is a poem called Never Again shall not fall slogan the Jews had never again derived from appointment 1927 called Masada see the poem is about the siege of Assad and which group of Jewish Rebels they held out against the Roman armies according to the legend and they committed mass suicide rather than be captured but the slogan re-emerged again in the 1940s see 1941 to 1945 Nazi German as allies murdered about 6 million Jews see they tried to implement their final solution to the Jewish question and the first use of this phrase never again in the context of the Holocaust was in April 1945 when the newly liberated survivors of the back of now concentration camp displayed it in various languages and handmade signs notice six million Jews died at the hand of an evil Nazi regime all because of their ethnicity because of their religious origin their holes were stripped away from them all their possessions were confiscated and sold their guns were taken away or they were deceiving and turning over their guns so that they didn't have a way to protect theirselves their businesses were shut down they were forbidden the work they were not allowed in education they were treated as sub-human creatures they were loaded on trains like livestock with 150 inner cart that should only hold 50 and they were shipped across the country without food without water without proper facilities not even a bucket they were sent to ghettos and they lived like animals fighting for every scrap of food that they could find some men women children old young were sent to concentration camps to death camps where the sooner they arrived they were killed immediately some were sent to labor camps where they were starved and yet forced to work until they died of physical exhausted all this was done against her will they were lied to they were deceived they were murdered they were forced by an evil satanic denominate a demonomic anointing and when those survivors of that consultation count were free they vowed never again never again will we set aside and let our freedoms be stripped away from us never again will we have slowed down our arms and not have a way to fight Never Again Church never again well we set us out allow our fellow countrymen and die to handle their oppressors without putting up a fight never again will be be put in bondage and let me say this tonight Church never again will the Church of the Living God be denied any promise in the Bible never again when she said and stand aside and the dead allow the devil to ramrod her and strip her her freedom and of her rights her rights to the full word of God her rights to every promise in the Bible her rights to a supernatural experience her rights to the baptism of the Holy Ghost never again will she set aside and watch your own people be destroyed by sin by The Vices of the enemy while men refuse to preach the Bible men refused to preach the gospel they refused to have prayer lines they refuse to have altar costs never again will she sit lifeless and dead and just go to some concentration camp without putting up a fight we will fight hear me tonight Church of the Living God we're gonna fight and not stand like Churchill we're going to fight on the beaches we're going to fight on the landing ground we're going to fight enough Fields we'll fight in the streets we're gonna fight in the Hills We'll Never Surrender oh even I Tabernacle don't you lay down your arms tonight it's this Total War give me some volume up here this is total war we ain't come to mess around with the devil we've come to go on the attack we're gonna fight for our families we're going to fight for our children we're going to fight for healing we're going to fight for deliverance we're going to fight for Joy we're going to fight for peace we're going to fight for the Holy Ghost we're going to fight to these old bodies of our have been changed and we're sitting at the wedding supper of the land we will fight Church why because we have been made free can I go just a little longer acts 1 and verse 3. to whom also he showed himself alive after his Passion by many infallible proofs being seen in them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God and being a symbol together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father if we saith he you have heard of me for John truly baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence now if you go a few scriptures up and we realize that Jesus had been with him 40 days and he says now I'm leaving but I want you to go and Terry in the city of Jerusalem until you've been endued with power from on high and we find in Jude in verse Jude 1 and verse 3 says now when I gave all diligence to right unto you of the common salvation it was need for me for me to write unto you and to exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints notice now let me just show what the prophet said Jude was exalting the people that they should earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints and if that was being about 30 years after Pentecost such a short time and he's encouraged him get back to Pentecost come back to that same faith and notice they had fallen away from the faith in such a in such a so much time and he goes now what have we done in these 1900 years of all kinds of denominations and discrepancies and things that slipped into the church and caused these things so prophet of God will tell us and feast on the trumpets he said there will come a messenger in the last days will guide the people back to the first fruit back to the original Faith granted Lord that the great messenger Among Us now the great Christ the Holy Spirit made Vivid made understanding opening the word and revealing it to us may he guide them back to the original Pentecostal Faith like Peter said on the day of Pentecost see the original faith is the same faith that Judah is telling us to contend for he's telling you get back to that Faith notice we're not getting back to Azusa Pentecost that's not the faith we're being exhorted to get back to but we're exhorted to get back to the original Pentecostal faith and you can't have the original Pentecostal Faith with having the original Pentecostal experience which is the first fruits you got to have the Holy Ghost what is the Pentecostal experience it's to experience of freedom you've experienced freedom and he's accepted your worship he's accepted your life and he has sealed you until the day of your Redemption so we find that when they went to the upper room some how many of you ever thought about those that are in the upper man they were some Supernatural people you ever think about that man they must have been something else Peter James John Mary all these different ones man people that we just we put them up here we think man they had no problems but they went in the upper room just like you and I they were men and women just like you and I noticed they were not perfect news flash neither are you and I they had their own set of failures their own set of struggles they wrestle with certain things they were fighting the greatest battle that was ever fought just like you and I they went in some of them were afraid of the Romans some of them were afraid of religious leaders they were in bondage to the Romans I'm afraid that the slightest infraction they'd be put to death or they were afraid of the Romans or the Jews because or the the Pharisees and the Sadducees in the law of Moses because they were afraid if they one slide infraction they'd be stoned or that'd be this or they'd be that but notice when Jesus said go into the upper room or the city there and being due with power from on high they waited and they waited and they waited they didn't get hurt because he didn't show up they didn't get mad because he didn't show up they didn't get disgruntled because he didn't show up they came in there with all their failures they came in there with all their baggage they came in there with all their hurts they came in there with all their grudges they came in there with all their bitters but they waited until the 50th day until the day of Pentacles fully came and when the day of Pentecost fully came what did he do that came a sound like a rushing Mighty Wind and they come out stumbling out looked like they had been drunk they come out so drunk on the spirit of God see the photos of Pentecost came there came such a sound such a mighty winds tongues of fire the people come stumbling out of the upper room no longer in bondage no longer worried about the Romans no longer worried about the Pharisees the Sadducees or who see or who didn't see they wasn't worried about it they got drunk on the spirit and didn't care what others thought they didn't care what others did they didn't care you know what it'll do us a good good to do up some good if we just get drunk every once in a while oh y'all didn't see real amen about that one did you it would do us some good to get drunk now I'm not talking about on strong drink but I'm talking about to let go of your pride let go of your complex let go of your negativity and take a drink and when you're drunk once take another drink and take another drink and take another drink until you get good sales talk because you know what happens when you get drunk you don't care about your enemy you love everybody oh you laugh because it's the truth oh you've been there man when I got drunk I loved everybody until I want to fight them but you love everybody and everybody loves you you ain't got an enemy in the world you ain't worth you ain't holding on to yesterday you ain't holding on to what they said about you you're drunk it'll do you some good to get drunk let that bitterness go away he'll do some of you some good to get just take another drink and let that Grudge just slide out of it that Grudge that you're holding on it ain't doing nothing but hurting you but if you get drunk tonight if you can get drunk on the spirit of God get drunk in the Holy Ghost you'll see that Grudge roll right off your life that bitterness to get right off your life ain't got to fill it with a heart of love oh you coming you want to criticize and criticize the music and criticize a song leader and criticize a preacher and create a size of young people for dancing and criticize the running and criticize this and criticize get drunk one time you won't criticize anymore oh you get up out of that seat of the scarf and you'll begin to dance you'll begin to Rejoice but because you are free you had that same Freedom that same victory that same joy that day guys but you don't get it without drinking you say well bro Joe I gotta have a quote on that because that sounds real we ain't supposed to drink let me just share one with your Redemption and completeness completeness they were full of new wine that's right the wine that came from God out of Heaven did you ever see a drunk man he's just in love with everybody you see he don't care that's the way a man when he gets drunk on the spirit be not drunk on strong drink with excess but be drunk on the spirit the spirit of God makes you so drunk you forget all your enemies and everything and everybody is in love with you and he don't care about who is standing around you're the biggest man in the country notice he says I don't care if your neighbor's sitting next to you went to some five dignified church just let the Holy Ghost get on you one time and see what takes place get right real good South drunk her brother tells that's not my nature that's cause you ain't drinking you start drinking your nature change let me tell you when I started drinking I changed I got happy I got joy in my heart oh my I wish I could sing right now oh man I didn't care well I'm like that little mouse where is that cat at you didn't care who's the biggest man the smallest man you didn't have an enemy you didn't have you weren't worried about anything why because you done started drinking and you wasn't stopping till the bottle was done something you need to come to church and keep turning up the bottle until it's completely empty until you start changing oh your pride starts changing and everything starts changing and then all of a sudden the bitterness is gone and the complexes is gone and the depression is gone and the fear is gone and the pornography Spirits are gone and the lust devils are gone and all these other things are gone just start drinking church and get good sales drunk see you'll see what takes place you'll say sister I got it you wanted to so you ain't afraid program said Mary was in the upper room acting just as idiot as a restaurant he got just as drunk as they did see what was going on in that Upper Room they're Emancipation Proclamation was being signed because we called it you've been a Slave you've been in bondage you've had this you've had this you've had family strains you've had these fears you had all these things passed on you and they were in that upper room and all of a sudden he struck it off he declared that they were free they didn't just drag out oh that was a bad service he let me go free I got nothing to Rejoice about they stumbled out oh my a feast of freedom it was a feast of Pentecost which is a feast of Freedom the feasts of Pentecost A Feast of Weeks and here he is brother man would talk about the Emancipation Proclamation and every slave in the southern states when Abraham Lincoln signed that document he released every boy every girl every man every woman every person that was a slave in those Southern States could be free you know what they did there was an expected time see that's what the feast is is an appointed time and what they did they knew on a certain day that they were going to be declared free and so the strongest of them brother Aaron climbed to the top of the mountain and others climbed as far as they would look little old Grandma's brother said little old grandmas and grandpas they gathered at the base of the mountain everybody came there wasn't no missing this church service because why they were about to be declared free free from all the years of bondage they were pulled from Africa from the boards and came over here and were so some of them lost their families lost their children lost their spouses but now they were about to be declared free and the strongest of them will come to the top of the mountain and they waited all night long they waited with anticipation they waited with the excitement they waited because they knew when that light broke down Eastern Sky there they knew that they were declared free and all of a sudden the sun asks you in Rose early in the morning I'm going to tell you and they begin to shout down we're free oh we're free we're free until they got back to the base and all the grandmas and all the little kids all of them were free church I'm going to tell you God sent a prophet in this day and he climbed up to the mountain and it began to call to scream back at you you're free and the teachers took that message and they said you're free and the bankers took that message and they said you're free and the pastors took that message and they said you're free what am I declared to your church that the Emancipation Proclamation has been signed you're no longer in sin you're no longer held by man's ideas you are free tonight you are free I'm gonna end with this I could go on I got so much here but we got to be mindful I was looking at this I was looking at this and it came to my attention I was praying this isn't works his face expressed brother bear said I dreamed that I seen a man a young fellow in shackles and he was trying to get out and I said somebody told me sis those are horrible people don't have nothing to do with them and I've seen this young fella getting out of his shackles so I just let him alone I want you to pay attention to how he words all this and I thought and I said I'll just see what he does and so or he says so when he got out he was a nice fella and he goes and I've seen others trying to get out see they were held they were held in bondage against their will they didn't know any better but they had been chained they've been Shackled In but yet this young fella wanted to get out of his shackles and they got out of his shackles I could think of few people right now Let's cross this country right now that are getting out of shackles brother Tim and you find out they're really good people really good people and I hope you're listening tonight then he says I've seen others trying to get out he goes if someone pulled me away and I looked and it was a lady standing over here when I was a little boy and I used to haul groceries for at the from the grocery store to the to the peoples and she said brother Branham Deliver Us from this this was a house of hell and said you've been misunderstood and you're and you've misunderstood these people these are fine people and he goes and I looked over like a great big seller big walls down beneath the great big cave and great iron bars eight to ten inches thick let me read that again notice the bondage it's next to impossible to escape great big seller big walls down beneath the great big cave and great iron bars eight to ten inches thick people out of their minds Twisted arms and legs beating their heads like that and she was crying saying deliver the people brother branna and said help us we're in trouble notice now and he said she herself I know her she I believe she belongs I believe to the Church of Christ or the Christian church so what did the Church of Christ believe no emotion no excitement days of Miracles has passed be very reverent in church can't do this can't do that can't do this can't do that held in bondage held in bondage but people are wanting to be free people don't want to be held into that situation where they can't express the Liberties wherein crisis made them free you can't do this and he said they're going out of their minds Twisted arms and twisted legs beating their heads wanting something different wanting to be free he goes and I looked and they were beating their head like that way out or like that out of their mind he goes and then I seen the lights flicker around in there oh and I looked up and there stood the Lord Jesus with the lights of the rainbow around him and he was looking right straight at me delivered those people and he went away and I thought well how could I deliver and I haven't got to strength enough of my arms to break those bars so I said House of Hell give way to the name of Jesus and all the cracking and popping and the Rocks rolling and the bars are falling and the people screaming delivered and screaming at the top of their voice and was all see what we've witnessed in our day church is some flickers of light filters of light the Holy Ghost once again vindicating himself the same yesterday today and forever the light of Truth is flickering in the ministry of God called men and the same Lord Jesus is compelling the ministry today deliver the deliver the deliver the people and I'm so thankful tonight that there is Anointed men on the field who remain faithful to the word of God and to this message and they preach Freedom they preach Deliverance they preach the infallible word of God men who are not injecting their own ideas or own beliefs but they're staying with what the prophet said they're proclaiming in the face of the prison bars they're proclaiming in the face of man's ideas and man's interpretation of the word in the face of false doctors in the face of the false anointed ones that we have returned to Pentecost and we are determined to be free and I say House of Hell give way give way to the name of Jesus the name that's greater than all names and at the very mention of that name every Spirit has to Bow home to musicians to come see it's a feast of Freedom what does it do what does the Feast of Freedom do for a man it reminds him that you're not an angel it's a memorial is established in the word that you are free it liberates him from error it breaks to hold that false teaching and incorrect teaching has on them it frees him to worship it frees him to rejoice it frees him to shout and give a response to the word it gives him a dance it gives him victory over all his enemies just play something brother Mike whatever you got on your heart I'm going to end it with this a few years back there was some residents residents excuse me in Pensacola Florida they were the residents began to get disgruntled they began to complain they began to murmur because they had you know in Pensacola there's a naval
