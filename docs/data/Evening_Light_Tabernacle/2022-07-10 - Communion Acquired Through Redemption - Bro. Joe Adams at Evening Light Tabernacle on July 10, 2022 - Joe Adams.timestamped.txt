[31:58] you've called us to be but lord that
[32:00] song just resonates in our soul tonight
[32:02] we're going all the way lord
[32:04] father i remember a time where they do a
[32:06] line in the sand at the alamo and god it

[32:18] declaration father we're not backing up
[32:20] god we're not bending we're not bowed

[32:23] drawing the line and we're determined
[32:25] we're going to go all the way father we
[32:27] just asked that you'd come and speak to

[32:37] and you'll hear through them and receive
[32:40] lord we just yield ourselves to you
[32:41] right now in this very moment father
[32:43] [Music]
[32:45] god i just
[32:46] i surrender my gift to you lord
[32:49] that you can use it for the blessing of
[32:51] your people
[32:53] god we just give it to you this service
[32:55] father communion service time of
[32:58] fellowship
[32:59] god we just ask that you just have
[33:01] complete control and preeminence now
[33:03] but we ask it in jesus name
[33:06] amen if you have your bibles tonight
[33:08] we're going to look here in the book of
[33:10] ruth
[33:11] and i want to speak to you on a thought
[33:13] tonight on communion acquired through
[33:16] redemption
[33:17] communion acquired through redemption we
[33:20] look here in ruth verse 1 or chapter 1
[33:23] and verse one we'll read down through
[33:24] verse six and i'm going to kind of i've
[33:26] read this book of ruth probably several
[33:28] times four to five times this week alone
[33:31] and just gonna be pulling a lot out of
[33:33] it today with the help of the lord
[33:36] but we know that this is communion
[33:38] service i don't want to hold you too
[33:39] long because we have uh another aspect
[33:42] of the service this evening but it says
[33:43] now it came to pass in the days when the
[33:45] judges ruled that there was a famine in
[33:48] the land and a certain man
[33:50] of bethlehem judea judah went to sojourn
[33:53] in a country of moab he and his wife and
[33:55] his two sons
[33:57] and the name of the man was elimelech
[33:59] and the name of his wife was naomi the
[34:01] name of his two sons with maelon and
[34:04] chileon ephrathites of bethlehem judah
[34:07] and they came into the country of moab
[34:09] and continued there
[34:11] and elimalex naomi's husband died and
[34:13] she was left and her two sons
[34:16] and they took them wives of the women of
[34:18] moab and the name of one was orpah and
[34:20] the name of the other was ruth and they
[34:22] dwelt there about 10 years
[34:24] and maelon and chilion died also both of
[34:27] them and the women was left or the woman
[34:29] was left and her two sons and her
[34:31] husband
[34:33] then arose then she arose with her
[34:35] daughters in law
[34:37] that she might return from the country
[34:38] of moab
[34:40] for she had heard in the country of moab
[34:42] how that the lord had visited his people
[34:45] and giving them bread you can have your
[34:47] seats this evening
[34:49] so like i said we want to speak to you
[34:51] this evening on communion
[34:53] acquire through redemption this word
[34:55] communion was going to take it from a
[34:57] different angle and not so much as we
[34:59] take our communion the lord's supper
[35:01] tonight but a different look at it but
[35:03] the word communion here means the
[35:05] sharing or the exchanging of intimate
[35:07] thoughts and feelings
[35:09] the sharing or exchanging of intimate
[35:13] thoughts and feelings and the word
[35:14] intimate means private and personal
[35:18] so i want you to think about communion
[35:19] as the sharing of private and personal
[35:22] thoughts and feelings
[35:25] and the word acquired here means to get
[35:27] as one's own to obtain gained by the
[35:29] result of an effort or an experience and
[35:32] augustine would say that the word
[35:34] communion comes from two words one being
[35:36] calm which means with and together and
[35:39] the other being eunice which is oneness
[35:42] in union so we can see that communion
[35:44] can mean with oneness or a together
[35:47] union otherwise it solidifies solidarity
[35:50] it means that we become one
[35:52] and by this relationship we're sharing
[35:54] intimate thoughts and we're sharing
[35:56] intimate feelings and the prophet of god
[35:58] would tell us that many will proclaim
[36:00] the book of root to be just a love story
[36:02] but he said it's more than a love story
[36:04] it's a prophet not only is it a prophet
[36:06] but it's a history and it's a love story
[36:09] and it's it's not only a love story or a
[36:11] history or a prophet it's god himself
[36:14] because in the beginning was the word
[36:16] the word was with god and the word was
[36:17] god he said now but he goes that ought
[36:20] to sell it brethren god on print jehovah
[36:23] printed on a book he says now this book
[36:27] of ruth was one of the most outstanding
[36:29] books
[36:30] that they have accepted why it's because
[36:32] it's just he goes why if it's just a
[36:34] love story why would the writers or the
[36:36] ancient sages accept the book as inspire
[36:39] he says because there's a hidden
[36:40] revelation in it
[36:42] so in the book of ruth we want to
[36:44] understand that it's more than a love
[36:46] story but there is a hidden revelation
[36:48] in it and it's hidden he says it's a
[36:50] hidden revelation he goes you catch the
[36:52] real meaning and it'll bring you real
[36:54] close to god
[36:56] so you catch the real meaning of the
[36:58] book of ruth and we find the prophet of
[37:00] god will tell us he says now we find in
[37:02] the book of ruth we hear about the
[37:04] kinsmen redeemer and we know that to
[37:06] redeem us to bring back anything that
[37:08] was lost he says but in the law of
[37:10] redemption and israel there had to be a
[37:12] kinsmen to redeem a property of somebody
[37:15] that had been lost and there was
[37:16] requirement for the kinsmen redeemer the
[37:18] requirements meant he had to be ken or
[37:20] he had to be close ken he said he
[37:22] couldn't be a way off kinsmen and he
[37:24] also had to be financially able and he
[37:27] must make a public testimony
[37:31] so we think about naomi and we think
[37:33] about her family and the name naomi
[37:35] means pleasant in elimelech his name
[37:38] means worship so we found when they were
[37:40] in bethlehem judah they had pleasant
[37:42] worship
[37:44] but we find there came a famine in the
[37:45] land and the prophet of god would tell
[37:47] us the first mistake a jew ever makes is
[37:49] when he leaves the land
[37:52] see god gave them that land when abraham
[37:54] was given the land god told them not to
[37:56] leave the land and he made a mistake
[37:57] when he went down to guerrer he got into
[37:59] trouble he says a jew is never to leave
[38:01] palestine he says that's his lotted
[38:04] place and it was a it was a mistake that
[38:06] elimelech made when his family left the
[38:10] land of bethlehem to go down and search
[38:13] for bread and we find as they left the
[38:16] promised land their days got darker and
[38:18] darker and darker until he died and not
[38:21] only him but his sons died and now
[38:23] there's three graves
[38:26] in the land of moab
[38:28] three graves
[38:30] because they were in search for
[38:31] something that was not there they left
[38:33] where it was at
[38:35] and we find that naomi who means
[38:37] pleasant no longer was she considered
[38:39] pleasant now her laughter and her hope
[38:41] had left and now she becomes sad
[38:44] but this ef this effect or this
[38:47] incident with the losing of her husband
[38:49] and the losing of her children what this
[38:51] does it begin to put a drive in her life
[38:54] to get back to the land where she was
[38:56] born to get back to the land where she
[38:58] had her early childhood to get back to
[39:00] the place where she was early married
[39:02] where they when she drank of the well of
[39:04] bethlehem and where life was a blessing
[39:06] and he didn't have all the hardships he
[39:08] didn't have all the difficulties he
[39:10] didn't have all the loneliness and
[39:12] brother madam would tell us and juan had
[39:13] to be shepherds he said bethlehem means
[39:15] the house of god's bread
[39:18] so we find here her husband leaves the
[39:21] house of god's bread in search for bread
[39:25] but only to find disaster and
[39:26] destruction
[39:28] and brother branham would tell us or the
[39:30] bible would tell us in john 6 35 jesus
[39:33] said unto them i am the bread of life so
[39:36] when we think of bread we immediately
[39:37] think of life we think of the substance
[39:40] to sustain life and when you find if
[39:42] you've done any reading or any kind of
[39:44] historical search of what happened to
[39:46] the jews there in the world in the 1940s
[39:49] underneath the persecution of the the
[39:51] germans there they longed for bread they
[39:53] long just a little morsel of bread
[39:55] helped sustain them and it was black
[39:57] bread hard bread but i say that to say
[40:00] that bread was the essence of life and
[40:02] today bread is our essence of life but
[40:04] we're not longing for what we had back
[40:06] there just about an hour ago but we're
[40:08] longing for the spiritual bread and
[40:10] jesus would come until he goes i am that
[40:13] bread that comes down out of god from
[40:15] out of heaven that if you hunger and you
[40:16] partake of this bread you'll never
[40:19] hunger and thirst again
[40:21] he goes i am the bread of life your
[40:23] fathers did eat manna in the wilderness
[40:25] but they are dead
[40:26] and verse 51 he says i am the living
[40:29] bread which came down from heaven if any
[40:31] man eat of this bread he shall live
[40:33] forever and the bread that i will give
[40:36] is my flesh
[40:38] so as we partake of the communion
[40:40] tonight we're partaking in symbolic
[40:43] his life
[40:45] him giving us life transferring our dead
[40:48] sins and
[40:50] allowing us to come into life now he
[40:52] said bethlehem was a place of the bread
[40:54] of the nation it was the bread of all
[40:57] the house of israel that come from there
[41:00] he was the bread of life that come down
[41:01] from heaven the spiritual man has to
[41:03] come from bethlehem the bread line the
[41:06] place where bread laid
[41:09] see but they left the promised land and
[41:11] no matter how bad it was to sojourn over
[41:14] in another land brought trouble
[41:17] now young people the prophet of god will
[41:18] tell you if any christian ever gets off
[41:20] on those grounds well i'll just i'll go
[41:22] down tonight with the boys to the pool
[41:24] hall and it'll do no harm i'll just take
[41:26] a little drink
[41:29] you take that little drink and doesn't
[41:30] think it's going to cause you any harm
[41:32] but you're out of the promised land
[41:33] you're off the grounds that god entitled
[41:36] you to be on
[41:38] and you may think you can stay there
[41:40] elimelech only intended to stay until
[41:42] the famine was over but his family was
[41:44] there for 10 years
[41:46] 10 long trying grueling years she was
[41:50] left there
[41:51] without a husband she was left there
[41:53] without children because of a mistake
[41:56] that her husband made
[41:57] because he didn't think that it was
[41:59] gonna hurt but we found what did it do
[42:01] it caused death it caused destruction he
[42:03] says you're only setting a course for
[42:05] trouble oh the little rest of the girl
[42:07] smoke i'll just try one he goes you're
[42:08] off your grounds don't do that stay in
[42:10] the homeland oh well everybody over here
[42:13] they'll call me old folky they'll call
[42:14] me old-fashioned he says stay there
[42:17] anyhow that's your place stay in christ
[42:22] so let me encourage you young people as
[42:24] we heard last night pretending to give
[42:26] all we heard a marvelous message last
[42:29] night no longer should we pretend to
[42:31] give off stay where god has ordained you
[42:33] to blossom stay where he's ordained you
[42:35] to be blessed stay where he's ordained
[42:37] you to grow and that you could be a
[42:40] blessing in the promised land you don't
[42:42] have to go out into the world we got
[42:44] everything that we have need of right
[42:46] here under this roof under this ministry
[42:48] under this message we don't need to go
[42:50] searching for happiness happiness is
[42:52] right here we don't need to go searching
[42:54] for joy we have joy unspeakable and full
[42:57] of glory we don't need to go to the
[42:59] doctrine and i'm all about going to the
[43:01] doctor but we got healing right here
[43:03] everything we have need of is right here
[43:06] in the homeland of the word where
[43:08] there's life
[43:13] we finally in ruth one and verse six she
[43:15] arose with her daughters-in-law that she
[43:17] might return from the country of moab
[43:20] for she had heard in the country of moab
[43:22] how that the lord had visited his people
[43:25] and giving them bread she began to hear
[43:27] rumors of what was taking place down in
[43:29] that church
[43:31] she began to hear rumors what was going
[43:33] on there was life in that church there
[43:36] was life back in the homeland there's
[43:38] life again and she begins to hear this
[43:41] and notice and when she heard that there
[43:43] was life down there something began to
[43:45] pull upon her heart no i didn't the
[43:48] desire to stay in moab it waned it left
[43:50] pretty quick because now she realized
[43:53] it's not been easy in moab and your life
[43:55] won't be easy outside the promised land
[43:57] of this word
[43:58] oh you may have good days but you'll
[44:00] have a lot more bad days and good days
[44:04] there begin to be a pull a better be a
[44:06] drive to bring her back to the homeland
[44:08] and it's something when it's something
[44:10] to me how
[44:12] when your life is in a struggle
[44:15] but yet god places a desire he places
[44:18] something so deep inside of you and it's
[44:20] the desire to live
[44:22] it's a desire to seek out life it will
[44:24] drive some people to endure extremely
[44:27] difficult situations the desire to live
[44:32] the desire and why are you here tonight
[44:36] because there's there is a desire in
[44:38] your heart to live there's a desire in
[44:41] your heart tonight
[44:42] to to move forward and we find here moab
[44:46] notice she was in moab and the prophet
[44:47] of god will tell us moab represented the
[44:50] nicolaitans
[44:52] it was carnal christianity many of them
[44:54] fine speakers doctors of philosophy and
[44:56] great men we heard about it this morning
[44:58] men that use psychology he says you
[45:00] can't deny that but they have a form of
[45:02] godliness but they deny the power they
[45:05] deny the life that's in bethlehem
[45:09] they think they can do it with all their
[45:10] psychology all their intellectual
[45:12] understanding you know brother tim made
[45:14] that statement this morning about these
[45:16] great men and their great intellectual
[45:18] understanding i begin to look at my life
[45:19] and be saying thank god you're not
[45:21] intelligent
[45:24] that's one time that you just can't
[45:25] thank god for because you're not you're
[45:27] not using or you're not you're not
[45:29] depending on your own human ability when
[45:32] you step behind this desk because you
[45:34] have no enticing words you have no
[45:36] intellectual things to give to people
[45:38] but what you're depending on is the
[45:40] anointing you're depending on the life
[45:42] that was in bethlehem because i've
[45:44] partaken of that bread and now that
[45:46] bread comes inside of us as a believer
[45:49] and what does it do it begins to produce
[45:51] life
[45:52] that's why you're here you're in search
[45:54] for life tonight and god has brought you
[45:56] here because god is having his desire
[45:58] within his own heart to have communion
[46:01] and fellowship with his creation
[46:06] we find people today they hear that
[46:08] there's bread in bethlehem
[46:10] oh there's bread at this church there's
[46:12] bread at that church there's life
[46:14] they're willing to leave
[46:16] the dead lifeless lands that they've
[46:18] been dwelling in because there's a
[46:20] desire to live
[46:23] when they hear that there's freedom of
[46:24] worship freedom to praise the living god
[46:27] that there's life not only for the older
[46:29] generation but also for the young
[46:30] generation
[46:32] i was speaking to a baptist minister or
[46:34] not a minister but a baptist gentleman
[46:36] the other day last week sometime and i
[46:38] did a job for him and we were he was
[46:40] just telling he goes to the first
[46:41] baptist church there in sibley he said
[46:42] it used to be 150 people in that church
[46:46] i said well we got about 60 young people
[46:48] from the age of 13 and up and he says oh
[46:50] my he goes we used to have that
[46:52] but it dried up
[46:55] land's dried up oh church how blessed
[46:58] are we the lands aren't drying up
[47:00] no there's reports of different ones
[47:02] wanting to move here but why because
[47:04] they hear that there's life being given
[47:06] and even like tabernacle now we don't
[47:08] owe it to ourselves as men know but god
[47:10] is pouring out his life god is the one
[47:13] that visits our services that's why we
[47:14] can have convention style meetings on a
[47:17] wednesday night or per adventure on a
[47:19] saturday night in a youth service when
[47:21] the after call is given every seat
[47:23] become empty and every young person was
[47:25] at the altar why because god is once
[47:27] again visiting his people by giving them
[47:30] bread by giving them life
[47:33] oh but he's not only giving life for
[47:35] this life but he's giving you for the
[47:36] life thereafter he's giving you eternal
[47:39] life
[47:45] they're willing to leave the land of
[47:47] moab
[47:50] and relocate to where
[47:52] life is being served
[47:55] why are you here
[47:58] some of you
[48:00] why are you here
[48:02] you heard
[48:04] now you've come and you've tasted it
[48:07] you've tasted you've experienced
[48:10] service after service
[48:12] the giver of life comes by
[48:15] and he's handing out
[48:18] exactly what you have need of
[48:20] sister landed he handed you life since
[48:22] the mirah he handed you life drew he
[48:25] handed you life over and over and over
[48:27] and over and over
[48:29] he's been handing servant up breath life
[48:33] substance
[48:34] for your existence
[48:36] now we find here
[48:38] people are willing to move to where the
[48:40] lord has once again visited his people
[48:44] by giving them
[48:45] spiritual food in due season
[48:49] we're not depending brother tim on dr
[48:51] dobson
[48:52] or any of these other great if you want
[48:54] to call it that great denominational
[48:56] preachers who uses psychology and look
[48:58] intellectual understanding but no god
[49:00] has once again visited
[49:02] his ministry
[49:04] god has once again visited those who
[49:06] seek him daily who are behind the closed
[49:09] doors behind the veil and they get into
[49:11] a relationship and they have communion
[49:13] with god and that word communion means
[49:16] to be able to speak back and forth with
[49:18] and that's what he desires tonight more
[49:20] than you just coming up and for taking
[49:22] another bread another wine he wants to
[49:24] have that back and forth relationship
[49:26] where he can bring you into a state of
[49:28] communion maybe tonight you're far off
[49:31] but you don't have to remain there
[49:33] you don't have to pretend anymore as we
[49:35] heard last night no you can go all the
[49:37] way tonight you don't have to just stop
[49:38] and turn around and go back no you can
[49:40] keep going forward and god's going to
[49:42] give you a land god's gonna bless you
[49:44] once you arrive in that homeland
[49:47] you've got a promise of the holy ghost
[49:49] you've got a promise of healing
[49:50] deliverance whatever it is there it is
[49:52] it's in the land
[49:54] as we heard this morning everything that
[49:56] we have need of in this journey is
[49:58] already in you even the rapture
[50:02] i tell you we should be the most excited
[50:04] people the most happy people and they
[50:06] want you to shut up they want you to not
[50:07] be emotional when they realize on the
[50:09] inside of me who i was in once in
[50:12] darkness but now i've been made
[50:13] light-wise because i've entered in into
[50:15] a land that's serving up bread and
[50:18] serving up life i got a reason to shout
[50:21] you got a reason to rejoice tonight
[50:23] because you're no longer in moab church
[50:25] you're on your way to bethlehem
[50:28] and there's life there
[50:32] brother tim could easily easily
[50:35] brother timothy brother aaron myself we
[50:37] could easily stop preaching that way
[50:39] we're preaching
[50:40] if we're only
[50:42] going to be dictated at what men say
[50:44] about the ministry
[50:46] well
[50:47] did you hear what they'd done down there
[50:48] in bethlehem how they acted
[50:51] man i heard how one girl she just ran
[50:52] around the church
[50:55] if we're worried about what man thinks
[50:57] of as sure
[50:58] but i'm not in fellowship or communion
[51:00] with man i'm in communion with him
[51:03] and that's not my word that i want to
[51:05] bring to you it's his word and that's
[51:07] what the ministry is for is to bring his
[51:09] word to the people
[51:12] notice
[51:13] in ruth 1 verse 8 and naomi said unto
[51:16] her two daughters well let's go down to
[51:17] verse 11 excuse me
[51:19] naomi said turn again my daughters
[51:22] why will you go with me are there yet
[51:25] any more sons in my womb that they may
[51:27] be your husbands turn again my daughters
[51:29] go your way for i am too old to have a
[51:31] husband and if i should say i have hope
[51:34] if i should have a husband also tonight
[51:37] and should also bear sons would you
[51:39] tarry for them until they were grown
[51:41] would you stay for them for having
[51:44] husbands nay my daughters for it grieve
[51:46] with me much for your sake that the hand
[51:48] of the lord is going against or out
[51:51] against me in verse 14. and they lifted
[51:53] up their voice
[51:54] and they wept again
[51:56] and orpah kissed her mother-in-law but
[51:59] ruth clave unto her
[52:02] now brother madam would tell us in the
[52:03] message kinsmen redeemer he said now
[52:05] oprah is a type of the lukewarm church
[52:07] that once started
[52:10] a type of the church that won't go all
[52:12] the way
[52:15] otherwise the pretender oh they looked
[52:18] apart
[52:20] you know they they have their hair long
[52:21] but they know maybe they trim the ends a
[52:23] little bit here and a little bit there
[52:24] they don't do the makeup when they're at
[52:26] church but they do it other places you
[52:27] know they looked apart but when it comes
[52:29] to really going all the way when it
[52:31] comes to really surrendering all when it
[52:33] really comes to serving god and getting
[52:36] where life is being served up
[52:38] i i just don't know it's a strange land
[52:41] i'm not sure what's down there you know
[52:42] all i can go by is hear say and notice
[52:45] what the prophet of god would say says
[52:46] she kissed her mother-in-law and
[52:48] returned back again he says that's the
[52:52] type of the lukewarm believer who will
[52:54] believe jesus to be christ and then turn
[52:56] around and go back into the thing that
[52:58] they come out of and you wonder why so
[53:00] many have left the ranks of the message
[53:03] because they wasn't there wasn't a root
[53:05] there was an opera they started out but
[53:07] when the road got tough when they didn't
[53:09] know what was down that was that they
[53:11] were headed toward you find they turned
[53:13] around and they gave up and they went
[53:15] right back to the thing they come out of
[53:19] the first thing that the ladies do is
[53:21] whack off their hair
[53:23] put on their makeup put on their pants
[53:26] they come they go right back to the
[53:28] thing that they come out of
[53:30] see otherwise oprah was a type
[53:33] of the believer that pretends to give
[53:34] all only to return back
[53:37] they want the title of being a christian
[53:38] but not go all the way to do what's
[53:41] necessary to be
[53:42] born again
[53:44] she turned back to our gods many times
[53:46] we returned back to the gods of our
[53:47] beginning maybe we got eyes of lust
[53:50] after the wrong thing we'll turn back to
[53:52] lusting again maybe we're we got idols
[53:54] and drinking and idols of smoking and
[53:55] idols of lion idols are stealing all
[53:58] those kind of idols and then profess to
[53:59] be baptized and then turn again what a
[54:03] sad thing he says you remember it never
[54:05] spoke her name no more she was
[54:07] excommunicated because of her decision
[54:12] she turned her back
[54:15] to go back to the things that she come
[54:17] out of but ruth
[54:19] oh i pray there's a ruth here tonight
[54:22] but root the type of the believer now
[54:24] when she comes out the person of the
[54:26] world he comes in amongst the christian
[54:28] believers women that used to smoke drink
[54:31] play cards at societies and so forth all
[54:33] kinds of fancy stuff like some kind of
[54:36] frizzled up bird but now she changed she
[54:38] made a decision to go with god and the
[54:40] brother baby say when i accepted christ
[54:42] i was turned out by my own home when i
[54:45] accepted christ my boyfriends and
[54:46] girlfriends everybody throw me down i
[54:49] went with a bunch of old people that had
[54:51] the holy ghost and believed in god
[54:53] serving him the girls that was down
[54:54] there in church were different than the
[54:56] ones that i used to be going with they
[54:58] looked different they acted different
[54:59] they were strange and i was scared of
[55:01] them but they were different people
[55:05] he said ruth had to make her decision
[55:10] and you got to make your decision
[55:13] you got to make your decision tonight
[55:14] you'll never walk out these doors this
[55:17] morning
[55:18] without some kind of decision you'll not
[55:20] leave this room today either being a
[55:22] better man or woman or worse man or
[55:25] woman to reject it listen young person
[55:28] especially you that's on the fence
[55:30] to reject it you'll be worse
[55:33] he said it's harder the next time for
[55:34] you to get in or you'll go out better he
[55:37] said it come to a showdown in her life
[55:39] and it comes to a showdown in
[55:41] everybody's life
[55:44] and when we think about communion
[55:46] the act
[55:47] of communion that we're going to partake
[55:49] of tonight
[55:50] communion service is always a real
[55:52] strict one
[55:54] he said because it brings us to a
[55:56] showdown
[55:58] so when you come to the table tonight to
[56:00] partake it's a showdown you're making
[56:03] your decision known
[56:05] when you partake of the body and you
[56:07] partake of the wine and you partake of
[56:08] the bread and what you're saying is
[56:11] i've given i've yielded my life i've
[56:14] made my decision i'm going all the way
[56:17] i'm not living a halfway hypocritical
[56:19] pretending life but no i've made my
[56:21] declaration i've become a root i'm gonna
[56:24] make my stand tonight and i'm partaking
[56:26] of that life because the bible also says
[56:29] that if you eat it and drink it
[56:30] unworthily then you eat it and drink
[56:32] damnation to your own self
[56:35] so we got to examine our lives
[56:40] but god brings us to the communion
[56:43] as a reminder
[56:44] of redemption
[56:46] it wasn't that they left the land of
[56:49] egypt that he's saying do this and
[56:51] remember to me he's saying do this and
[56:53] remember to me ma this bread represents
[56:55] my body
[56:56] he broke it and he handed it out to his
[56:59] disciples
[57:00] showing that he is the same today
[57:03] breaking of himself and handing it to
[57:05] each and every one of you and says do
[57:07] this in remembrance of me partake of it
[57:09] in remembrance this is my cup my cup my
[57:12] blood i've yielded i poured it out i
[57:15] emptied my life out so that you can be a
[57:17] partaker do this in remembrance of me
[57:20] and remember to what in remembrance that
[57:22] i played the part of the kinsmen
[57:24] redeemer
[57:25] and i did it to bring you into communion
[57:28] i did it to bring you into fellowship
[57:30] i did it to more than just have a
[57:32] conversation with you but that we can
[57:35] share intimate thoughts
[57:37] intimate feelings
[57:38] now notice fruit in verse 16 and ruth
[57:40] said entreat me not to leave or to
[57:43] return from following after thee for
[57:45] wither thou goest i will go whether thou
[57:47] lie just our laws thy people shall be my
[57:50] people and thy god will be my god for
[57:52] thou dost i will die where thou will be
[57:54] buried that the lord do so to me and
[57:57] more if i ought but death part thee and
[57:59] me notice the heart of a true believer
[58:03] where you go i'm going
[58:05] i'm going all the way
[58:08] where you lodge i'm lodging
[58:11] your people they may be strange but
[58:13] they'll be my people
[58:15] your god i don't know him right now but
[58:17] he'll be my god
[58:19] where you die i promise i'll die there
[58:21] with you they'll bury me beside you
[58:24] and this is a desire that we each have
[58:27] to have tonight because it can't be
[58:28] based on somebody else's religion but
[58:31] that god that was hers had to become
[58:33] roots god she had to know god for
[58:35] herself and you've got to know god for
[58:37] yourself and where she goes you go and
[58:39] where he is you are and if it's in the
[58:42] church if it's out of the church
[58:43] wherever you go you don't take a
[58:44] vacation from god wherever god is that's
[58:47] where we want to be wherever the holy
[58:49] spirit is pouring being poured out
[58:50] that's where we want to be where the
[58:52] life of the word is being delivered
[58:54] that's where we want to be your god will
[58:56] be my god if it makes me run that's okay
[58:59] i'll run with you god if it makes me
[59:01] shout i'll shout amen lord because what
[59:03] i want i want to be found faithful to
[59:05] the house of god
[59:07] ruth said i'll go where you go your
[59:09] people will be my people your god will
[59:10] be my god where you live i'll live will
[59:13] you die i'll die where you're buried
[59:14] i'll be buried that's the real decision
[59:16] lord i'll take you as my savior if the
[59:19] bible says repent and be baptized in the
[59:21] name of jesus christ that i'll do if the
[59:23] bible says i must receive the holy ghost
[59:26] that i'll do if the bible tells me that
[59:27] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[59:30] and forever that i will believe
[59:34] he goes i'll take the bible and god for
[59:36] what he's wrote and what he is no matter
[59:39] what anybody else says
[59:41] see she made her decision she either had
[59:44] to go back or go forward
[59:47] and you're coming tonight to the
[59:49] communion you're either going to go back
[59:51] or you're going to go forward
[59:55] and the only one can make that decision
[59:56] is you
[59:58] as much as i would brother tim timothy
[1:00:01] brother aaron any of us ministers mom
[1:00:03] and dad
[1:00:04] as much as we would want to make the
[1:00:07] decision for our children we can't
[1:00:10] you have to make your own decision
[1:00:14] i will say tonight needs to be the time
[1:00:16] that you say wherever you go i'll go
[1:00:20] whatever you do i'll do
[1:00:23] if it means leaving the world i'm
[1:00:25] leaving the world
[1:00:26] if it means being filled with the holy
[1:00:28] ghost i want to be filled with the holy
[1:00:29] ghost
[1:00:30] if it means believing for the
[1:00:31] supernatural i want to believe tonight
[1:00:34] if it means believing against all odds
[1:00:36] against impossibilities i want to
[1:00:38] believe that god still does impossible
[1:00:40] math
[1:00:42] see she made her decision she was
[1:00:44] converted and he said you got to make

[1:01:37] you god will not disappoint you young
[1:01:39] person if you make that clean cut
[1:01:42] decision i'm going all the way
[1:01:44] where you go i'll go
[1:01:47] see they came notice they they began to
[1:01:49] come back naomi and ruth came just at
[1:01:52] the barley season barley season was the
[1:01:54] bread season the season where fresh
[1:01:56] bread was being served up and the church
[1:01:57] in the last days had been through
[1:01:59] throughout
[1:02:00] 2 000 years of pagan teaching and things
[1:02:03] and has come in the barley season notice
[1:02:05] the harvest time
[1:02:08] that's where we are church we've done
[1:02:09] been through six church ages now we're
[1:02:11] at the end of the seventh church age
[1:02:13] we're at the time of the harvest we're
[1:02:15] not in the planting stage
[1:02:17] we're at the harvest stage you don't
[1:02:20] have many more days left we don't have
[1:02:23] many more days left but what we do find
[1:02:25] was there being fresh bread is being
[1:02:27] served up in bethlehem
[1:02:30] and that's what's happening even in like
[1:02:31] tabernacle
[1:02:33] fresh bread is being served up
[1:02:35] and for some of you it makes you shout
[1:02:38] some of you it makes you dance in the
[1:02:40] spirit you get a bite of that bread with
[1:02:42] a little bit of honey and butter on it
[1:02:44] oh my you don't know how you'll act
[1:02:46] i like some tomato gravy and biscuits i
[1:02:48] wonder maybe maybe they got some of that
[1:02:50] down there in that land but it's fresh
[1:02:51] bread
[1:02:52] no matter what kind of bread you make
[1:02:54] out of it it's fresh bread because you
[1:02:56] may not like wheat bread you may not
[1:02:57] like biscuit but it doesn't matter it's
[1:02:59] fresh bread and it makes it to your
[1:03:01] liking all you got to do is go down
[1:03:03] there and say lord i want a bite i want
[1:03:05] a service of some fresh manna tonight
[1:03:07] lord i need something from you tonight
[1:03:09] and it may make you run it may make you
[1:03:11] shout it may make you speak in tongue it
[1:03:13] may make you prophesy but it doesn't
[1:03:15] matter what it makes you it's being
[1:03:17] poured out and even like tamara god has
[1:03:19] visited his people one more time he's
[1:03:22] come on the scene at the harvest season
[1:03:24] to tell you a young person and to tell
[1:03:26] you mom and dad i'm here i'm still god
[1:03:29] and i got it in control tonight and i'm
[1:03:31] pouring out fresh manna all you got to
[1:03:33] do is get into the land and partake of
[1:03:36] it
[1:03:38] fresh bread is being served up
[1:03:45] and you think you hear about mistake
[1:03:51] ruth two and verse two and root the more
[1:03:53] body is sent unto them let me now
[1:03:55] go to the field
[1:03:56] and glean ears of corn after him
[1:04:00] whose sight i shall find grace
[1:04:04] and she went and she came and gleaned in
[1:04:06] the field after the reapers and her hap
[1:04:09] or she happened
[1:04:10] to light on the part of the field that
[1:04:12] belonged to boaz
[1:04:15] who was the kindred of elimelech and
[1:04:18] behold boaz came from bethlehem
[1:04:21] and he said unto the reapers the lord be
[1:04:22] with you and they answered him the lord
[1:04:24] blessed thee
[1:04:26] then said boaz unto the servant that was
[1:04:28] said over the reapers whose damsel is
[1:04:31] this
[1:04:32] i want you to see the parallel church
[1:04:35] it's got to be more than a story there's
[1:04:36] a hidden revelation that's tied into
[1:04:38] this book of ruth and the servant was
[1:04:41] set over the reapers and he answered and
[1:04:42] he said it is the moabitess damsel that
[1:04:44] came back when they owe me out of the
[1:04:46] country of moab
[1:04:47] and she said i pray you let me glean and
[1:04:50] after
[1:04:51] and gather after the reapers among the
[1:04:52] sheaves so she came and had continued
[1:04:55] even from the morning until now and she
[1:04:57] tarried little in the house
[1:04:59] then said boaz unto ruth
[1:05:02] hearest thou not my daughter go not to
[1:05:04] glean in another field neither go from
[1:05:06] hence but abide here fast by my maidens
[1:05:10] notice boaz first spoke to ruth
[1:05:14] she didn't approach him
[1:05:15] but he approached her she would not dare
[1:05:18] approach him here she was an alien from
[1:05:20] a strange land and him being the lord of
[1:05:23] the harvest but yet he takes a break
[1:05:26] from speaking to his servants to the
[1:05:28] reapers and he addresses her
[1:05:33] see he interrupts his conversation with
[1:05:35] the foreman to speak to poor uh poor
[1:05:37] stranger gleaning in his field and
[1:05:40] notice he invites her to glean in his
[1:05:42] field the entire harvest
[1:05:47] brother braham says now boaz found her
[1:05:49] out in the field
[1:05:50] and he said who are you and she said my
[1:05:51] name is ruth oh the moabite that came to
[1:05:54] sojourn with us yes he goes i've heard

[1:07:20] when his eyes saw the moabite the
[1:07:22] gentile the alien someone from another
[1:07:25] country noticed boaz was never married
[1:07:27] and he was an older gentleman but when
[1:07:29] his eyes saw that moabite out there
[1:07:31] gleaning in his field something struck
[1:07:33] his heart oh let me tell you you know
[1:07:35] what it was it was love at first sight
[1:07:37] and when our heavenly father saw you

[1:07:57] and what does he tell you don't go glean
[1:07:59] in another field you don't have to leave

[1:08:15] from place to place stay here
[1:08:17] oh i love that
[1:08:19] he says now while she was gleaning in
[1:08:21] the field directed by the holy ghost
[1:08:23] to go into the field to glean then up
[1:08:26] come boaz boaz was the representative of
[1:08:28] christ for he was the lord of the
[1:08:29] harvest he was over all the harvest and
[1:08:31] notice as soon as he looked out in the
[1:08:33] field and saw that gentile girl he fell
[1:08:36] in love with her
[1:08:40] come on young boys
[1:08:43] you know what it is when your eyes fall

[1:09:05] heart started racing
[1:09:06] oh my
[1:09:08] something he looked at it none of the
[1:09:10] other girls struck him the way she
[1:09:12] struck him
[1:09:14] down through the ages
[1:09:17] this one struck him at harvest season
[1:09:20] this is the one
[1:09:22] notice
[1:09:23] brother brown says when a man loves a
[1:09:25] woman and he marries her because she's
[1:09:27] just pretty he goes there'll be an end
[1:09:29] to that
[1:09:31] and don't you brother say amen that is
[1:09:33] not the appropriate time
[1:09:36] no sir not unless you want to have a bad
[1:09:37] communion
[1:09:41] he says but when a man finds a woman
[1:09:43] that he loves now here you go brother
[1:09:44] hale this is for you
[1:09:46] that he loves he don't know why
[1:09:50] but he loves her
[1:09:52] all right i got an amen in the back can
[1:09:54] i get another
[1:09:56] he says that's an eternal mate in glory
[1:10:00] see death nor nothing else can ever
[1:10:02] separate them because why they are from
[1:10:04] eternity they stepped into space of time
[1:10:07] and were returned back into eternity
[1:10:09] attorney has dropped down into the body
[1:10:11] called time then it goes right back into
[1:10:13] eternity again it cannot perish he said
[1:10:16] a woman that's beautiful that beauty
[1:10:17] will fade just as sure
[1:10:20] but did you know that that well-formed
[1:10:22] little figure that god had given that
[1:10:24] girl may be rotten by this time next
[1:10:26] sunday
[1:10:28] that tall dark handsome man may be
[1:10:31] nothing but just a pile of rubbish by
[1:10:33] next sunday that all perishes but that
[1:10:35] on the inside god love
[1:10:38] lives for eternity
[1:10:40] and notice he didn't know why he loved
[1:10:42] her but when he saw her out there
[1:10:43] gleaning in the field he loved her
[1:10:48] oh i hope you can see
[1:10:50] that god doesn't know maybe he didn't
[1:10:51] know why he fell in love with you but he
[1:10:53] did
[1:10:54] and maybe you question lord are you sure
[1:10:57] i'm just a gentile i'm just a moabite
[1:10:59] i'm just this i'm just that i measure up
[1:11:01] i got faults i got wings but he loves
[1:11:03] you
[1:11:04] he loves you and the lord of the harvest
[1:11:07] fell in love with her her being an alien
[1:11:09] he's oh what a picture
[1:11:11] he says don't leave this field
[1:11:14] he fell in love with her he said brother
[1:11:16] why don't you keep saying that because
[1:11:17] i'm trying to get to somebody he fell in
[1:11:19] love with you
[1:11:20] and if he ever fell in love with you he
[1:11:22] never falls out of love with you
[1:11:26] if he ever falls in love with you he
[1:11:29] never falls out of love with you
[1:11:33] he said don't leave the field stay put
[1:11:35] don't be tossed about on every win the
[1:11:37] doctrine stay in the word he fell in
[1:11:39] love with her and he commanded her not
[1:11:41] to leave the field but stay right there
[1:11:44] and glean fastly
[1:11:46] see ruth a beautiful woman
[1:11:49] went out into the field a boy asked to
[1:11:51] glean
[1:11:51] with all the other peasants she'd been a
[1:11:54] type of the gentile bride he said she
[1:11:56] went out behind the harvesters to pick
[1:11:58] up a few straws
[1:12:02] but when his eyes cast upon her he fell
[1:12:04] in love with her christ with his church
[1:12:09] and he says whose damsel is this notice
[1:12:11] she found grace in his sight
[1:12:14] in you tonight with all your
[1:12:18] all of that
[1:12:20] because we all have it
[1:12:22] he loves you anyway
[1:12:26] he loves you anyway
[1:12:28] all your indifference
[1:12:30] all your quirks
[1:12:32] all your little
[1:12:34] yeah we all have it but he loves you
[1:12:35] anyway
[1:12:39] and the brother of them says now that's
[1:12:40] what the church does today while the
[1:12:41] lord of the harvest is going by he ain't
[1:12:43] looking for big
[1:12:45] big buildings big steeples well-trained
[1:12:46] choirs he's looking for an individual
[1:12:49] men and women who are dedicated and made
[1:12:51] a clear-cut decision for christ
[1:12:52] consecrated himself to his service god i
[1:12:55] believe it every word when your word
[1:12:57] says anything i say right there that's
[1:12:59] your word i believe in every word that's
[1:13:01] what he's looking for the lord of the
[1:13:03] harvest that's what he wants to do is
[1:13:05] give the holy spirit to those who are
[1:13:07] hungering and thirsting for life
[1:13:10] see god led you to this church
[1:13:14] god led you to the message of the hour
[1:13:16] because the bible says sons of god are
[1:13:18] led by the spirit and god's sovereign
[1:13:19] plan is working to your good and you may
[1:13:21] be an alien you may be in a strange land
[1:13:23] but you're and you may be gleaning in a
[1:13:25] stranger's field but god has bigger
[1:13:27] plans for you
[1:13:29] you're not going to always be a beggar
[1:13:31] you're not going to always be a gleaner
[1:13:34] and a few short sunsets you're going to
[1:13:37] be the one who owns the field
[1:13:41] he led you here
[1:13:43] he led you here
[1:13:44] for the purpose of communion
[1:13:48] because he wants to express
[1:13:50] his great desire for you
[1:13:53] he wants to express
[1:13:55] deeper feelings than just a conversation
[1:13:57] in the field
[1:13:59] god has a purpose
[1:14:01] but that purpose can only be fulfilled
[1:14:04] through the act of redemption
[1:14:07] and we'll get into that as we go just a
[1:14:09] few more minutes i know we we have
[1:14:10] communion here but i want to just try to
[1:14:12] get to this point so he led you here for
[1:14:14] a purpose and we are here today
[1:14:16] believing the message gleaning in the
[1:14:18] lord's field because we have been
[1:14:20] predestinated
[1:14:23] god doesn't make mistakes
[1:14:26] you're not here by mistake
[1:14:29] do you think you just happened to be at
[1:14:31] evening like tabernacle on a sunday no
[1:14:33] god led you here
[1:14:36] because god's got something in the field
[1:14:37] for you
[1:14:39] he's got greater plans no matter what
[1:14:41] you face
[1:14:43] no matter how difficult life becomes
[1:14:47] there's something inside of you driving
[1:14:49] you
[1:14:50] to stay in the field
[1:14:52] stay in the field
[1:14:54] stay in the field otherwise some of you
[1:14:55] had already left
[1:14:57] stay in the field
[1:14:59] no matter what i go through stay in the
[1:15:00] field no matter what i've done god what
[1:15:03] did he do he deposited a seed on the
[1:15:05] inside that sea gene of life and that
[1:15:07] that seed is hungering for life and it's
[1:15:10] got to get where life is being poured
[1:15:12] out
[1:15:13] that's why you couldn't stay in your
[1:15:14] denominational system brother hale
[1:15:17] that's why the enticements of the world
[1:15:18] couldn't hold some of you young boys
[1:15:21] some of you grown-ups tonight
[1:15:23] because there was something that you
[1:15:24] didn't know what was there but god
[1:15:26] placed it there before the foundation of
[1:15:27] the world and when
[1:15:30] when you begin to hear about man there's
[1:15:32] something happening
[1:15:34] there's something god there's there's
[1:15:36] there's a better life than the life that
[1:15:37] i'm living there's a there's really a
[1:15:39] life down there and you begin to hunger
[1:15:41] after it see the seed of god begins to
[1:15:44] long for communion with its maker and it
[1:15:46] drives you and it guides you into the
[1:15:48] field of boaz
[1:15:51] because god has got something greater
[1:15:53] for you we know that the bible tells us
[1:15:55] that all things work together
[1:15:58] brother andy all the hardships they're
[1:16:00] working together
[1:16:02] all the bruises and bumps along live's
[1:16:04] highway they're working together
[1:16:06] to get you to the right field
[1:16:09] because there's something happening in
[1:16:11] that field
[1:16:13] notice she found grace in his sight the
[1:16:16] lord of the harvest
[1:16:18] the man who owned the field took notice
[1:16:21] of her
[1:16:22] all these other damsels out there
[1:16:24] gleaning but he only took notice of one
[1:16:28] he's seen your labors he's watched you
[1:16:30] glean
[1:16:31] and he asked you don't go into another
[1:16:33] harvest or another field stay right here
[1:16:36] stay in my field notice what he does
[1:16:40] when you
[1:16:41] when you get in his field route 2 and
[1:16:43] verse 15.
[1:16:45] and when he was risen up to or when she
[1:16:47] was risen up to glean boaz commanded his
[1:16:49] young men saying
[1:16:50] let her glean even among the she's and
[1:16:53] reproach her not
[1:16:55] to glean among the she's this was a
[1:16:57] privilege
[1:16:58] because no person should glean till the
[1:17:00] shees were all bound and a shot crawl
[1:17:02] set up otherwise he was telling his
[1:17:05] disciples or his ministers
[1:17:07] let her glean with those best ears of
[1:17:09] corn
[1:17:11] flour glean where it's heaped up
[1:17:14] because the word chief means heaped up
[1:17:16] let her glean where the best corn is
[1:17:20] let her let her glean where
[1:17:23] there's been a reaction
[1:17:26] and there's something falling and it's
[1:17:27] falling and multiple so where she
[1:17:29] doesn't have to work so hard to get it
[1:17:32] notice what he says now he says and let
[1:17:34] fall off so some of the handfuls of
[1:17:36] purpose for her and leave them that she
[1:17:39] may glean them and rebuke her not and i
[1:17:42] love what the what brother adam says now
[1:17:43] he says now here she is gleaning for
[1:17:46] life and he goes i want you reapers you
[1:17:48] angels in other words
[1:17:49] that's what that's what they are i want
[1:17:51] you angels new reapers every once in a
[1:17:54] while drop a handful on purpose don't
[1:17:56] let it be so tiresome for her
[1:18:00] you know church shouldn't be so tiresome
[1:18:02] for your church because what is he doing
[1:18:03] he's coming by dropping him for his own
[1:18:05] purpose
[1:18:06] he says every once in a while drop a
[1:18:08] hand full on purpose he goes let her
[1:18:10] hear a good message let it let a good
[1:18:13] power of the holy spirit cover over
[1:18:14] every once in a while and let her know
[1:18:16] that i'm still here do something out of
[1:18:19] healing amongst her some kind of sign or
[1:18:21] wonder that she'll know that i'm still
[1:18:23] in her midst oh that's what he's done
[1:18:25] and even like tabernacle he's combined
[1:18:27] he's dropped hand bulls on purpose here
[1:18:30] he comes and he he dropped you a handful
[1:18:31] saying i'm el shaddai the seed of the
[1:18:34] promise is mocked i'm el shaddai i'm
[1:18:36] filling every fiber i'm out shady eye
[1:18:39] and we find here he's he's circumcised
[1:18:42] without hands he's dropping handfuls and
[1:18:44] handfuls on purpose and we hear messages
[1:18:46] like the light who can't contend being
[1:18:49] led to victory the light the promise
[1:18:51] keeper he never left me pretending to
[1:18:53] give all god does impossible what is he
[1:18:56] doing he comes service after service and
[1:18:58] he drops you a handful and he drops you
[1:19:00] a handful and he drops you a handful and
[1:19:02] he drops you a handful because he don't
[1:19:04] want him to be so tired he wants you to
[1:19:06] enjoy coming to the field you enjoy
[1:19:09] reaping and cleaning because well he's
[1:19:12] got something for you he's got an
[1:19:13] attraction to your church
[1:19:16] he's dropping him why is other people
[1:19:18] coming because they heard about the
[1:19:20] handful
[1:19:23] they heard about the handfuls
[1:19:26] there's healing
[1:19:27] there's deliverance there's holy ghost
[1:19:30] there's prayer lines there's altar calls
[1:19:32] there's a movement though the spirit
[1:19:33] there's tongues there's interpretation
[1:19:36] what is it a handful after a handful
[1:19:39] after a handful
[1:19:41] he's dropping it
[1:19:42] this was more
[1:19:44] than just
[1:19:45] sympathy for the poor
[1:19:48] no he had took notice
[1:19:50] he was doing something special
[1:19:53] something out of character
[1:19:55] but it was in character for him because
[1:19:57] now he's in love
[1:20:00] oh my my my my if you can see this
[1:20:02] revelation
[1:20:04] why has he come
[1:20:06] service after service because he's in
[1:20:08] love
[1:20:10] he's in love
[1:20:13] you know what we can fall out of love
[1:20:17] but he doesn't
[1:20:19] he's in love and the bible says when
[1:20:21] you're not faithful he remains faithful
[1:20:24] he's faithful because he loves you
[1:20:27] he's going to show up every service and
[1:20:29] he's going to drop you a handful on
[1:20:30] purpose now you ruth you gotta glean
[1:20:33] you you gotta go pick it up
[1:20:35] you gotta beat the chef out of it you
[1:20:37] gotta do your part and what notice what
[1:20:40] she did when she took and she gleaned
[1:20:42] she took it back to her mother-in-law
[1:20:44] and when her mother-in-law saw where
[1:20:45] she'd been or saw all this because she
[1:20:48] should have never gleaned that much
[1:20:50] she said my daughter where whose field
[1:20:53] did you glean in and she said the man
[1:20:55] that i gleaned today his name is boaz
[1:20:58] that changed the entire picture for now
[1:21:00] because naomi knew that was a near
[1:21:02] kinsman
[1:21:03] oh what am i telling you church you
[1:21:05] didn't just happen to light in this
[1:21:07] field god led you to this field because
[1:21:09] this is the field that is owned by our
[1:21:11] kinsmen redeemer jesus christ became sin
[1:21:14] oh he was no sin but he became sin so
[1:21:17] that he could play the part of the
[1:21:18] kinsmen redeemer to preach oh hallelujah
[1:21:21] i'm sorry church but i'm excited to
[1:21:23] bring you into a place of communion
[1:21:26] where god can pour out his heart god can
[1:21:28] pour out his life god can pour out his
[1:21:30] healing god can pour out his love that's
[1:21:33] why he brought you here
[1:21:35] he brought you to this field
[1:21:38] for a purpose
[1:21:42] where if you glean to feel the bow ass
[1:21:45] notice what our mother-in-law says now
[1:21:48] daughter
[1:21:49] the harvest is over
[1:21:52] and boaz is going to be down at the
[1:21:54] threshing floor
[1:21:56] and when you get down there i want you
[1:21:57] to go down there i want you first
[1:22:02] i want you to
[1:22:03] i want you to make yourself ready
[1:22:07] wash thyself
[1:22:09] how do you do it by the washing of the
[1:22:11] water of the word
[1:22:12] wash yourself
[1:22:14] allow yourself to be cleansed allow
[1:22:16] yourself all those indifferences and
[1:22:18] just wash yourself all the complexes
[1:22:20] wash yourself for all the grudges all
[1:22:23] those little things right there they're
[1:22:24] trying to drive malice and strife and
[1:22:26] divide homes and divide this church wash
[1:22:28] yourself for that notice and anoint them
[1:22:30] oh yeah let the holy ghost come on and
[1:22:32] anoint you
[1:22:33] anointing she says and put on the
[1:22:36] raiment upon thee and get thee down to
[1:22:38] the floor but make not thyself known
[1:22:40] unto the man until
[1:22:42] until he shall have done eating and
[1:22:44] drinking and noticing she went down onto
[1:22:46] the floor and did according to all that
[1:22:48] her mother-in-law bathed and when boaz
[1:22:50] was had eaten and drunk and his heart
[1:22:52] was married he went to lie down at the
[1:22:54] end of the heap of corn and she came
[1:22:56] softly and uncovered his feet and laid
[1:22:59] her down
[1:23:01] and it came past midnight and the man
[1:23:03] was afraid that we're being startled and
[1:23:06] he turned himself and behold a woman lay
[1:23:08] at his feet and he said who art thou and
[1:23:11] she answered i am ruth thy handmaid
[1:23:13] spread therefore thy skirt over thy
[1:23:15] handmaid for thou art are near kinsmen
[1:23:18] see she laid at boaz's feet
[1:23:21] not his head
[1:23:23] she was not to lord over boaz
[1:23:26] but she was humbling herself to his feet
[1:23:29] and brother brandon would say like this
[1:23:31] he says she laid at the feet of boaz and
[1:23:33] when he woke up he seen the confidence
[1:23:37] oh he goes my one of these days he will
[1:23:39] see the confidence that his church has
[1:23:42] got in him
[1:23:43] that's why we're here because we have
[1:23:44] confidence in him
[1:23:46] we have confidence in this ministry we
[1:23:49] have confidence in this message
[1:23:51] that's why you're here
[1:23:54] because now we're no longer at
[1:23:56] the field now we're at his feet
[1:24:00] he had taken his own robe the holy
[1:24:02] spirit and he spread it over her and we
[1:24:04] find here now
[1:24:06] brother brown tells us she said mark the
[1:24:08] place where he lies and when he lie down
[1:24:11] to sleep
[1:24:12] rest he goes you go lie down at his feet
[1:24:14] not his head for he is worthy and you're
[1:24:17] unworthy but take the blanket that he
[1:24:19] has covered and pull it over you
[1:24:22] you see oh my gosh i know that made
[1:24:24] think i'm a fanatic but see it just
[1:24:26] suits me that way mark where he lay at
[1:24:28] calvary where he laid down in the tomb
[1:24:30] of gethsemane mark and crawl up to his
[1:24:32] feet and lie down there and die yourself
[1:24:34] there you are cover yourself over with
[1:24:37] his skirt
[1:24:38] and we find that this word or this
[1:24:41] phrase spread thy skirt over me is a
[1:24:43] symbolical action denoting protection
[1:24:46] otherwise she was coming before boaz and
[1:24:48] saying i want to become under your
[1:24:50] protection
[1:24:52] you're
[1:24:53] are near kinsmen you're the only one
[1:24:55] that has a responsibility and the
[1:24:57] obligation
[1:24:59] of bringing us under your protection
[1:25:01] otherwise she was saying to spread over
[1:25:04] her the token of or to spread over her
[1:25:07] his skirt was to say i want you to take
[1:25:09] me in marriage
[1:25:11] now some of you young boys you'd
[1:25:12] probably like that girl coming up to you
[1:25:14] right now say i want you to marry me
[1:25:18] you'll be like fool praise the lord
[1:25:19] that's easy
[1:25:21] but see in that time
[1:25:24] what she was doing she was forcing his
[1:25:28] hand to play the role of kinsmen
[1:25:30] redeemer
[1:25:31] now he knew that she was that she and
[1:25:34] naomi were near kinsmen but he also knew
[1:25:37] that there was a near ken
[1:25:39] and he couldn't
[1:25:41] go through the activity of doing that
[1:25:43] unless the near the nearer kinsmen
[1:25:46] proceeded first
[1:25:48] but now when naomi approached him or
[1:25:50] ruth approached him and she said spread
[1:25:52] thy skirt over me otherwise take me unto
[1:25:54] thy marriage what she is asking of him
[1:25:57] is i want you to play the part of the
[1:25:59] kinsmen redeemer
[1:26:01] because you're the near kinsman
[1:26:04] and the bible would tell us or the
[1:26:05] brother man will tell us
[1:26:07] she took the blank of the holy spirit
[1:26:08] and when she died out to herself she
[1:26:10] marked the place where he died and where
[1:26:11] he died laid it down to rest and she
[1:26:13] laid down her and took the blanket that
[1:26:15] was over him and poured it over her and
[1:26:17] the man woke up and he says who's there
[1:26:19] because i'm ruth the more bite the
[1:26:20] handmaid and he raised up and he goes i
[1:26:22] perceive now that you're a virtuous
[1:26:24] woman
[1:26:25] he took notice of her and she was making
[1:26:28] him aware of the relationship that he
[1:26:30] had with naomi her mother-in-law that he
[1:26:32] was near ken and he had the
[1:26:34] responsibility and he she told him by
[1:26:36] redeeming naomi you get me
[1:26:40] by redeeming naomi you get my love you
[1:26:43] get my devotion you get my affection you
[1:26:46] get my time you get my praise you get my
[1:26:48] worship
[1:26:50] and so we find boaz and we look here in
[1:26:52] ruth 3 and verse 11. he says now my
[1:26:54] daughter fear not i will do
[1:26:56] to thee all that thou requires
[1:27:00] verse 12 and now it is true that i am
[1:27:02] thy near kinsmen howbeit there is a near
[1:27:04] kin or a kinsmen nearer than i
[1:27:06] tarry this night and it shall be in the
[1:27:08] morning that he will perform thee
[1:27:10] if he will perform thee the part of the
[1:27:12] kingdom and well let him do the kinsmen
[1:27:14] part but he will not do the part of the
[1:27:15] kinsmen to thee then i will do the part
[1:27:17] of the kinsmen to thee as the lord
[1:27:19] liveth
[1:27:20] lie down until the morning
[1:27:22] notice the bid that she made was only
[1:27:24] between him and her
[1:27:26] she didn't make it a public spectacle
[1:27:28] she didn't make it a public show
[1:27:30] and she left before the morning before
[1:27:32] anybody knew of the request that was
[1:27:34] made
[1:27:35] and we find here the hebrew word for
[1:27:37] widow signifies one that is dumb and
[1:27:40] boaz he didn't bid her to go and talk to
[1:27:42] the kinsmen the nearer kinsmen for
[1:27:44] herself he says i'll go for you
[1:27:48] so the hebrew word here for widow means
[1:27:51] dumb boaz therefore would open up his
[1:27:53] mouth for the dumb he would speak on her
[1:27:56] behalf
[1:27:57] and i'm so glad so glad that he speaks
[1:28:00] on our behalf
[1:28:02] see instead of touching her
[1:28:04] he blessed her as a father he encouraged
[1:28:06] her as a friend he promised her as a
[1:28:07] kinsmen he rewarded her as a patron and
[1:28:10] he sends her away laden with hopes and
[1:28:12] gifts
[1:28:13] and no less chase more happy than she
[1:28:16] came
[1:28:16] god doesn't leave you the same
[1:28:19] he makes it much better for his church
[1:28:22] so he goes and we look here in ruth
[1:28:24] fours we bring this down to a close
[1:28:27] and boaz went to the gate and he sat
[1:28:29] down there and behold the kinsmen of
[1:28:30] whom boaz spake came unto him
[1:28:33] who he said he said
[1:28:34] such a one turn aside and sit down and
[1:28:36] he turned aside and he sat down and he
[1:28:38] took ten men of the elders of the city
[1:28:40] and they said sit down here and they sat
[1:28:42] down and he said unto the kinsmen naomi
[1:28:43] that has come again out of the country
[1:28:45] of moab
[1:28:46] selleth the parcel of land
[1:28:48] which was our brother elimolex
[1:28:50] and i thought to advertise these saying
[1:28:52] by before the inhabitants and before the
[1:28:54] elders of my people if thou will redeem
[1:28:57] it redeem it but if thou will not redeem
[1:28:59] it then tell me and i may know for there
[1:29:01] is none to redeem it beside thee and i
[1:29:04] and after thee and he said i will redeem
[1:29:06] it
[1:29:07] then said boaz what day thou buys the
[1:29:10] field of the hand of naomi thou must
[1:29:12] also by ruth the moabitess the wife of
[1:29:15] the dead to raise up the name of the
[1:29:17] dead upon his inheritance now brother
[1:29:19] batman tells us in the message to
[1:29:21] kinsmen redeemer he said now there was a
[1:29:22] nearer kinsman to you and that's the
[1:29:24] devil
[1:29:25] but he said now
[1:29:26] the first you belong to him because why
[1:29:28] you're his property you were born in sin
[1:29:30] shaped and iniquity to come to the world
[1:29:31] speaking lives but he could not redeem
[1:29:34] it he could not so christ come was made
[1:29:37] man to take away sins to redeem us do
[1:29:39] you see it and the other man couldn't do
[1:29:41] it the devil couldn't die for sins
[1:29:43] because he was a very perverter that
[1:29:45] made sin so he could not he'd marred his
[1:29:48] own inheritance the other fellow and
[1:29:50] satan would mar his because he is a
[1:29:52] devil he cannot become another devil to
[1:29:54] take away the devil the first devil he
[1:29:57] cannot become sin because he was already
[1:29:59] sin but christ being sinless became a
[1:30:02] sinner he could redeem us hallelujah we
[1:30:04] are redeemed we are redeemed that means
[1:30:06] to be brought back and we are redeemed
[1:30:08] see satan's whole plan from the
[1:30:09] beginning was to destroy god's creation
[1:30:12] and if he was going to rear up seed on
[1:30:15] behalf of elimelech on behalf of naomi
[1:30:17] and behalf of maelon then he would mar
[1:30:20] his own inheritance so he couldn't and
[1:30:22] so because he wouldn't then boasted i
[1:30:24] will do the part of the kinsmen redeemer
[1:30:27] and i want you to know that satan
[1:30:28] decided he could not redeem you but
[1:30:30] there's one that stepped out of glory
[1:30:32] and he came down and he saw you and he
[1:30:34] says i will play the part of the kinsmen
[1:30:37] redeemer this day and he plucked off his
[1:30:39] shoe and then he handed it to him he
[1:30:41] says now i will take ownership of all
[1:30:43] that belonged to naomi and by redeeming
[1:30:45] what belongs to naomi i get ruth the
[1:30:47] more bite brides
[1:30:53] he gets ruth
[1:30:55] and he becomes her husband
[1:30:58] and the prophet of god will tell us
[1:31:00] he said the reason jesus came to the
[1:31:02] jews alone he had to redeem the jew in
[1:31:04] order to get the gentile bride
[1:31:07] what did he redeem he redeemed your soul
[1:31:09] from hell he redeemed you he brought you
[1:31:11] back everything that adam lost when he
[1:31:12] put your name he put you in a pawn shop
[1:31:14] jesus christ on calvary he was our
[1:31:16] kinsmen redeemer redeems you of every
[1:31:18] curse of the devil he redeems your soul
[1:31:20] redeems your sick body redeems your
[1:31:22] weary dreary spirit he brought you
[1:31:24] happiness he brought you joy he brought
[1:31:27] you that's what the redemption brought
[1:31:28] you brought you peace long suffering
[1:31:31] goodness gentleness meekness power the
[1:31:33] holy ghost brought you divine healing
[1:31:35] all these things jesus christ brought to
[1:31:38] you because why he is our kinsmen
[1:31:41] redeemer
[1:31:42] and he did all this because he desired
[1:31:45] to have communion with you
[1:31:48] he desired
[1:31:49] to have communion
[1:31:51] and he can only redeem
[1:31:54] now he could he could only become in the
[1:31:57] state of communion with rude by
[1:31:58] redeeming naomi
[1:32:02] notice
[1:32:04] ruth 4 and verse 13. so boaz took ruth
[1:32:07] and she was his wife
[1:32:08] and he went unto her and the lord gave
[1:32:10] her conception
[1:32:12] and she bear a son
[1:32:15] i want some musicians to make their way
[1:32:17] back
[1:32:23] said he took ruth and he married her and
[1:32:24] she brought forth the son obed and obed
[1:32:26] was the father of jesse and jesse was
[1:32:28] the father of david who was the father
[1:32:29] of christ the father of the lord jesus
[1:32:31] and through that righteousness through
[1:32:33] that clear-cut decision
[1:32:36] he became our kinsmen redeemer he became
[1:32:38] kin folks to us to come down and be made
[1:32:40] like us human beings suffer hunger and
[1:32:43] thirst
[1:32:44] and he did all this
[1:32:46] so that he could have communion
[1:32:48] with you tonight
[1:32:50] that's what he longs for church
[1:32:55] as we partake of this bread and wine
[1:32:57] tonight god has a greater desire of your
[1:33:00] life
[1:33:02] than you just stepping up here tonight
[1:33:04] and putting a piece of bread in your
[1:33:06] mouth
[1:33:07] and taking a sip of wine
[1:33:09] god is looking
[1:33:11] for a daily communion with him
[1:33:15] he's done all the work
[1:33:18] he's done all the effort he paid the
[1:33:20] ultimate price
[1:33:21] and what he's looking for tonight
[1:33:23] is communion
[1:33:26] the exchange
[1:33:29] of intimate feelings
[1:33:32] the exchange of a love affair
[1:33:35] a love affair that would bring forth a
[1:33:37] child by their union
[1:33:40] and i believe that that's what he wants
[1:33:42] out of our life
[1:33:43] is that
[1:33:45] that life to come forth out of our life
[1:33:48] because there's a love affair brother
[1:33:49] braham said god poured himself into
[1:33:51] christ correct christ poured himself
[1:33:53] into the church
[1:33:54] at that day you know that i'm in the
[1:33:56] father you and me and i and you
[1:33:57] the whole thing is a plan of redemption
[1:34:00] coming down that god coming back to live
[1:34:02] in and dwell in and commune to his
[1:34:05] people as he did it at the beginning
[1:34:08] he said see he gets in his church in
[1:34:10] speaking condition gets his church to a
[1:34:12] place that he can flow himself through
[1:34:14] and love and persuade and fellowship
[1:34:16] then they'll come in eden he'll take his
[1:34:18] church back to where where he left it at
[1:34:20] the back in the garden of eden so he
[1:34:22] comes the holy spirit comes down and the
[1:34:24] miraculous power to transform your life
[1:34:26] picks you up and brings you inside the
[1:34:28] veil
[1:34:30] to where you have fellowship with god
[1:34:32] and you commune with him as adam did in
[1:34:34] the beginning in the garden of eden
[1:34:36] just by your heads just for a brief
[1:34:38] minute i know i'm over time

[1:34:47] as we partake of this communion service
[1:34:49] tonight as we hand it back over to
[1:34:50] brother tim
[1:34:53] the bread represents the body
[1:34:56] that he broke on our behalf
[1:34:59] the wine represents his blood
[1:35:01] the ultimate sacrifice that he made
[1:35:04] and he did it all
[1:35:06] to play the part of the kinsmen redeemer
[1:35:09] so that he can bring us into a place of
[1:35:11] communion to life can come from each
[1:35:13] life that's here tonight
[1:35:15] i just want you to
[1:35:17] take a few minutes before we turn the
[1:35:19] service over to brother tim and just
[1:35:21] evaluate your life
[1:35:25] because if you eat and drink of this
[1:35:27] wine and this bread unworthily
[1:35:30] i'm afraid you're
[1:35:32] you're guilty of eating damnation to
[1:35:34] your own life
[1:35:35] not discerning the lord's body
[1:35:38] but do it tonight in remembrance of the
[1:35:40] price that he paid not only the price
[1:35:42] that he paid but the desire that he has
[1:35:45] to take you from the field
[1:35:48] and make you a co-owner with him
[1:35:51] god has a great desire for us church
[1:35:55] and one day he's taking us out of this
[1:35:56] field of the world and he's going to
[1:35:57] take us into another land
[1:35:59] a land where there's no sickness no
[1:36:02] sorrow
[1:36:03] and it all because he wants to have
[1:36:05] communion

[1:43:36] he was wounded for our transgression
[1:43:39] he was wounded
[1:43:42] for our
[1:43:45] transgressions
[1:43:48] [Music]
[1:43:50] he was bruised
[1:43:53] for our
[1:43:55] iniquity
[1:44:01] surely
[1:44:03] he goes
[1:44:06] our sorrow
[1:44:11] and by
[1:44:13] his stripes we
[1:44:16] are healed sing it again now
[1:44:20] he was wounded
[1:44:23] for our
[1:44:25] transgressions
[1:44:30] he was bruised
[1:44:33] our
[1:44:35] iniquity
[1:44:40] surely
[1:44:45] our sorrows
[1:44:52] [Music]
[1:45:00] we come to the communion service
[1:45:02] tonight
[1:45:04] originally
[1:45:05] communion was at the passover
[1:45:09] there was the lamb the bitter herbs
[1:45:12] the wine and the unleavened bread
[1:45:15] these would all make up
[1:45:18] the passover supper
[1:45:24] and when jesus died and rose again and
[1:45:29] ascended into glory
[1:45:31] the church would meet together on the
[1:45:33] first day of the week
[1:45:36] and originally they would
[1:45:38] share a meal together
[1:45:41] maybe much like we'd done today in
[1:45:44] similar ways
[1:45:48] they would share a meal together and it
[1:45:50] was a
[1:45:53] different ones would bring their food
[1:45:56] and the rich would have
[1:46:00] their portion and the poor would have
[1:46:02] what meager parts they could bring
[1:46:07] and paul would
[1:46:08] examine this and prayed about it he said
[1:46:11] you know he said
[1:46:12] [Music]
[1:46:14] you're shaming the poor by bringing your
[1:46:16] abundance and
[1:46:18] some are even using this success
[1:46:21] why there's actually some that got drunk
[1:46:23] at the lord's table
[1:46:26] and he's he prayed about it and he said
[1:46:28] these words i received of the lord
[1:46:32] that which also i delivered to you
[1:46:35] that the lord jesus the same night in
[1:46:38] which he was betrayed took bread and
[1:46:41] when he had given thanks he break it and
[1:46:43] said take heat
[1:46:45] this is my body which is broken for you
[1:46:49] this due in remembrance of me
[1:46:52] and after the same manner also he took
[1:46:54] the cup when he had supp saying
[1:46:57] this cup is the new testament in my
[1:46:59] blood
[1:47:01] this do ye as off as you drink it in
[1:47:04] remembrance of me
[1:47:06] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:47:07] drink this cup you show the lord's death
[1:47:11] till he come
[1:47:13] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:47:15] and drink this cup of the lord
[1:47:17] unworthily
[1:47:19] shall be guilty of the body and the
[1:47:20] blood of the lord
[1:47:23] but let a man examine himself
[1:47:26] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:47:28] drink of that cup
[1:47:30] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:47:31] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[1:47:33] to himself
[1:47:35] not discerning the lord's body
[1:47:38] for just cause many are weak and sickly
[1:47:41] among you and many are asleep
[1:47:44] or dead
[1:47:45] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:47:47] should not be judged but when we are
[1:47:49] judged we are chastened of the lord that
[1:47:51] we should not be condemned
[1:47:53] with the world
[1:47:54] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:47:56] together to eat
[1:47:58] tarry one for another
[1:48:00] and if any man hunger
[1:48:02] let him eat at home
[1:48:04] that you come not together unto
[1:48:06] condemnation
[1:48:08] so paul would change this from a
[1:48:11] passover meal
[1:48:12] that they would have and
[1:48:15] they would
[1:48:16] instead just share and break the bread
[1:48:21] and the
[1:48:22] and sharing the wine
[1:48:24] because these would represent
[1:48:27] the death
[1:48:29] of our lord
[1:48:30] jesus and they were coming together and
[1:48:33] remembering
[1:48:35] remembering that he had died in their
[1:48:37] place
[1:48:39] and that on the cross that he paid
[1:48:42] for their sins
[1:48:44] and so he he took the elements of it and
[1:48:47] he said we're just going to take the
[1:48:49] bread it's unleavened
[1:48:51] it was called in the
[1:48:53] original
[1:48:55] the bread of haste
[1:48:57] there was no time to mix 11 with it and
[1:48:59] let it rise
[1:49:00] they were leaving
[1:49:03] so it reminds us
[1:49:05] that our going away
[1:49:07] is very soon
[1:49:10] we look at the unleavened bread and we
[1:49:12] see that there's nothing mixed with it
[1:49:14] no leveling which means
[1:49:16] which could represent sin something
[1:49:20] there that would put it in it that would
[1:49:22] puff it up
[1:49:23] make it rise
[1:49:25] and
[1:49:26] lebanon rep will become to known as
[1:49:29] as sin
[1:49:30] a little bit of leaven would contaminate
[1:49:33] the whole loaf
[1:49:35] so there's not to be any sin in christ
[1:49:37] and
[1:49:38] and in the body of believers which we
[1:49:40] are
[1:49:42] we are to put sin from us
[1:49:45] and then we take the wine which
[1:49:47] represents the blood of the new covenant
[1:49:51] in that blood
[1:49:53] was where that the life of the fruit of
[1:49:57] the vine which christ was that grape
[1:50:00] and he was squeezed out his life
[1:50:02] squeezed out for us
[1:50:05] that in the taking of his life and us
[1:50:08] we take his holy spirit
[1:50:11] into us
[1:50:13] this bread would represent the body of
[1:50:16] christ
[1:50:17] in this this is broken bread
[1:50:20] well his physical body was not broken
[1:50:24] not a bone was broken
[1:50:27] but this represents
[1:50:29] something that came from one loaf
[1:50:32] and his body today is not the physical
[1:50:35] body
[1:50:36] of jesus christ it is the spiritual body
[1:50:39] of jesus christ which is his church
[1:50:42] each one of you
[1:50:44] are part of that loaf
[1:50:47] each one of you
[1:50:49] make a part of that body
[1:50:52] when you take your portion today
[1:50:55] you're remembering i am a part of the
[1:50:58] body of jesus christ
[1:51:01] his life
[1:51:02] dwells within me
[1:51:04] i'm going to drink deep of the spirit of
[1:51:07] god
[1:51:08] i'm going to take that into me i'll i'll
[1:51:11] feel its burn and the life
[1:51:13] of that wine as it comes down and into
[1:51:16] my body i'll feel it as it goes down
[1:51:19] because it's a life
[1:51:24] it's more than just a
[1:51:27] squeezing of the grape but
[1:51:29] there's life in it
[1:51:31] and that life is the holy ghost that
[1:51:33] came back back on the day of pentecost
[1:51:36] which was squeezed out of christ for us
[1:51:40] so it's a time of remembering
[1:51:43] this is more than playing games
[1:51:45] and this is what paul said this is
[1:51:48] this is serious business
[1:51:51] we are typing out something
[1:51:54] if we
[1:51:56] if we break the type
[1:51:58] and we are living in sin
[1:52:01] and we're not representing christ and we
[1:52:03] break the type we're simply eating and
[1:52:06] drinking damnation to our body
[1:52:09] actually he says this is why many are
[1:52:12] sick some are sick
[1:52:14] many asleep they actually died
[1:52:17] because they didn't discern
[1:52:20] this is the lord's body
[1:52:22] this is serious business
[1:52:25] and the communion with christ is
[1:52:27] more than just taking bread and
[1:52:30] taking of the cup
[1:52:33] the communion
[1:52:35] represents
[1:52:37] a fellowship
[1:52:40] a fellowship that came by redemption
[1:52:42] that brother joe preached about this
[1:52:44] evening
[1:52:45] a fellowship that we have entered into
[1:52:47] and
[1:52:49] today
[1:52:50] let this start a new communion with the
[1:52:53] lord
[1:52:54] a renewed fellowship
[1:52:57] a new blessings from almighty god and
[1:53:00] that as you come and take the bread
[1:53:02] you can reconsecrate your life and
[1:53:04] rededicate yourself to them
[1:53:07] now
[1:53:09] you're
[1:53:10] welcome to the communion table tonight
[1:53:13] you don't have to be a member of this
[1:53:14] church to be
[1:53:16] come to the communion table
[1:53:18] you're welcome to come to the table of
[1:53:20] the lord with us
[1:53:23] [Music]
[1:53:24] the deacons will come to to usher you
[1:53:26] row by row and
[1:53:29] just as soon as you take the
[1:53:32] the the communion you go right out these
[1:53:34] doors and over here on the right we have
[1:53:37] things set up
[1:53:39] basins and towels and chairs and set up
[1:53:41] for the foot watching
[1:53:43] that's for the men and on this side for
[1:53:45] the ladies
[1:53:47] and if you're elderly or otherwise
[1:53:49] unable to get on your knees to wash feet
[1:53:51] just simply return to your seat there
[1:53:54] and be in prayer until we return to
[1:53:56] conclude the service
[1:53:58] some of our young children are old
[1:54:00] enough to remain in the sanctuary while
[1:54:02] the parents go out to foot washing it'll
[1:54:05] just help if you if some of the the
[1:54:07] older young children that are not taking
[1:54:10] foot communion and foot washing just to
[1:54:12] remain in the sanctuary if they can be
[1:54:15] reverent
[1:54:16] and
[1:54:17] but otherwise
[1:54:20] if you got several little children there
[1:54:23] maybe one of the fathers or the
[1:54:25] following the father can take a
[1:54:27] youngster to make less for the mothers
[1:54:29] to deal with
[1:54:31] here's what's important
[1:54:34] make this reverent
[1:54:37] only praying not talking
[1:54:40] to one another just talking only when
[1:54:42] absolutely necessary be reverent just
[1:54:44] like you were in the sanctuary this is a
[1:54:47] very very serious solemn time
[1:54:51] now
[1:54:52] we do foot washing because
[1:54:54] jesus at the passover
[1:54:57] he poured water into a basin
[1:54:59] took a town girded himself
[1:55:02] and he washed the disciples feet
[1:55:05] and he showed that
[1:55:07] [Music]
[1:55:09] we are to be servants
[1:55:12] to one another
[1:55:14] that is important as believers
[1:55:17] that we
[1:55:19] wash the dirt off of one another so to
[1:55:21] speak
[1:55:23] that we refresh
[1:55:25] one another
[1:55:26] that we have a care about us
[1:55:29] to each other
[1:55:31] now peter would
[1:55:33] when he was too old he said
[1:55:35] you know
[1:55:37] you know he said you'll never wash my
[1:55:39] feet no i'm not going to let you watch
[1:55:41] mine he said if i don't wash your
[1:55:44] feet you're not a part with me so well
[1:55:47] then just wash my head and my hands and
[1:55:49] everything didn't lord i i want to be
[1:55:51] totally all the way
[1:55:53] and he said no
[1:55:55] if you've been bathed
[1:55:58] you see in that day they had bath houses
[1:56:01] they took their baths at a bath house
[1:56:04] walking back
[1:56:06] to their homes
[1:56:08] to their places
[1:56:09] they had to walk through the trails
[1:56:13] you know animals
[1:56:15] was part of the transportation people
[1:56:18] rode on donkeys and horses and whatever
[1:56:20] and those sheep and goats and things
[1:56:23] made the droppings along there
[1:56:26] and their feet would pick up dust
[1:56:30] and jesus said no it's not necessary if
[1:56:32] you've been bathed
[1:56:34] is not necessary but for me just to wash
[1:56:37] your feet
[1:56:38] now let's bring the type down
[1:56:40] if you've been bathed you've been filled
[1:56:43] with the holy spirit of god you've been
[1:56:45] washed
[1:56:47] it's not necessary for you to go get
[1:56:49] re-baptized again and re-washed
[1:56:53] but hear your feet where you walk
[1:56:55] through the world
[1:56:57] or maybe you stumbled along the way or
[1:57:00] you made a mistake or
[1:57:03] you know we all do minor things wrong
[1:57:07] but it's a moment of time of
