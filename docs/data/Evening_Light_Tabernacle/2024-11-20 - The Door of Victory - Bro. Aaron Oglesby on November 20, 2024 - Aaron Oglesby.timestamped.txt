[41:26] privileges

[41:29] raise up raise up in faith to the level
[41:31] of the promises tonight and say Lord I

[42:35] commit it to you the reading of the word
[42:37] the preaching and the hearing as well in
[42:38] Jesus name amen amen amen if you have
[42:42] your Bibles with you tonight you'd like
[42:44] to turn with me to the Book of John the
[42:47] 10th
[42:48] chapter Book of John the 10th chapter
[42:50] and we'll and we'll read from the
[42:52] seventh verse John 10 and 7
[42:59] amen I'm going speak to you tonight on
[43:02] on the door of Victory the
[43:06] door of Victory you know I I I was
[43:10] originally just studying on the doors in
[43:12] in the Book of Revelation and and there
[43:14] in Revelation three and Revelation 4 and
[43:17] and the more I got into it and I just
[43:18] started coming across different quotes
[43:19] and scriptures about Jesus being the
[43:21] door Jesus being the door and
[43:23] recognizing the hour that we're in and
[43:25] how late it is and how close it is it
[43:27] was just really pressed upon my heart
[43:28] that that we got to get inside the
[43:31] door we got to get inside the door and
[43:33] so you may see a transition somewhere in
[43:36] this service where I kind of go towards
[43:38] those in in in the Book of Revelation
[43:40] but here at the beginning this is just
[43:42] what the Lord laid on my heart so I pray
[43:44] that you'll just receive it
[43:45] tonight John 10
[43:49] and7 it says then say Jesus unto them
[43:52] again verily verily I say unto you I am
[43:55] the door of the Sheep all that ever come
[43:58] before me are thieves and robbers but
[44:00] the Sheep did not hear them I am the
[44:03] door by me if any man enter in he shall
[44:07] be saved and shall go in and out and
[44:10] find pasture if you'll also turn with me
[44:13] we're going to look at Revelation three
[44:15] and verse 8 Revelation three and verse
[44:20] 8 he says I Know Thy Works behold I have
[44:24] set before thee an Open Door and no man
[44:27] can shut it for thou Hast a little
[44:30] strength and has kept my word and has
[44:32] not denied my name amen I pray that the
[44:36] Lord will add His blessings to the word
[44:37] as you have your seats this
[44:39] evening
[44:43] amen you know as I said a while ago I I
[44:46] believe we can all attest and and say
[44:49] that it would be what we all believe but
[44:51] I I I believe that we're at the very
[44:52] closing of time um as you look around I
[44:56] don't see how we could believe believe
[44:57] anything else as you see the word
[44:59] fulfilled and the conditions of the
[45:00] world and and we stand here at the close
[45:02] of time the wrapping up of all things
[45:04] and and no matter how certain you are I
[45:08] believe it always behooves us to check
[45:10] up no matter how sure that you're sure
[45:13] that you're sure it behooves us to check
[45:15] up to see where we're at and and to make
[45:18] sure and to line up and to dig deep as
[45:20] it were and there's such a great
[45:23] deception in the in the world today and
[45:25] and I know that the elect won't be
[45:27] deceived and and and yet we cannot have
[45:29] that lacad isical attitude about our
[45:32] destination uh the elect's not going to
[45:34] be deceived I'm elect so everything's
[45:35] going to be okay A lot of times I would
[45:37] say that would show you're not elect if
[45:40] that's your attitude towards thing
[45:41] because the elect don't don't just come
[45:43] by happen stance and well what'll be
[45:45] will be that's not their attitude but
[45:47] they're striving and they're pressing
[45:49] towards the mark of the high calling and
[45:52] you know truth today is rarely told and
[45:55] many times some of the worst lies people
[45:58] tell are to
[46:01] themselves I think it's harder to be
[46:03] honest with ourselves than it is with
[46:05] anybody
[46:06] else and how many times we fool
[46:08] ourselves and we we put a smile on our
[46:11] face and we press on and say
[46:12] everything's fine everything's fine when
[46:15] when everything ain't fine and you lay
[46:17] your head on your pillow and you
[46:18] convince yourself I know I got it I know
[46:20] I got it but there's something nagging
[46:21] on the inside of your heart but but what
[46:23] about this thing what about that thing
[46:26] and yet instead of Fai in it and being
[46:27] honest with ourselves many time we lie
[46:29] to ourselves and and you know we live in
[46:31] a time where people are being taught to
[46:33] live their truth you hear this saying a
[46:37] lot of times especially amongst like the
[46:39] lgbtq groups and and different advocacy
[46:42] groups you know be yourself Live Your
[46:44] Truth you know be true to yourself and
[46:47] and be who you are and live your truth
[46:49] and it's pushed in movies and it's
[46:50] pushed in music it's pushed in schools
[46:53] and it's the general mindset of the
[46:55] world today that anything that would
[46:57] that mold you outside of what you want
[47:01] outside of what you desire in some way
[47:04] is robbing you of your true self it's
[47:07] robbing you of your right to express
[47:09] yourself and to act according to how you
[47:11] feel is right for you and I'd like to
[47:14] say tonight that that is the propaganda
[47:16] of hell that is Hell's propaganda that
[47:19] you got to live your truth because there
[47:21] is no such thing as your truth there is
[47:24] only one truth and that is Jesus Christ
[47:27] he is the only one that has truth that
[47:30] is truth he is the truth he is the life
[47:33] he is the way Jesus said unto him I am
[47:38] the way the truth that is singular that
[47:40] doesn't say I'm one of the truths I'm
[47:42] part of the truth he is the truth and
[47:44] the life and no man cometh to the father
[47:48] but by me and one thing we have to
[47:51] recognize and maybe this would seem even
[47:53] geared to the youth but I I don't think
[47:55] so I feel like you know if we all sit
[47:57] around a campfire we all coming away
[47:58] smelling like smoke so if we all Walk
[48:01] Through This World we all get bombarded
[48:03] by the same influences and there's a
[48:05] there's a real selfish influence in the
[48:07] world today that that wants it to be all
[48:08] about you that wants it to be all about
[48:11] me and and what can I do for me and and
[48:13] but the emphasis of a Godly life is to
[48:17] die to self the emphasis of a Godly life
[48:21] is to die to your will to lay aside your
[48:24] ambition and your desires and and align
[48:26] your life with his word which is his
[48:29] will amen what did Jesus teach us over
[48:32] and over again not my will not what I
[48:35] want not what I think is best Matthew
[48:38] 7:21 not everyone that saith unto me
[48:40] Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom
[48:42] of heaven but he that doeth the will of
[48:45] my
[48:46] father he that doeth the will of my
[48:50] father Luke 11:2 and he said unto them
[48:53] when you pray say Our Father which art
[48:55] in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy
[48:57] kingdom come thy will be done as in
[49:01] heaven so in Earth and more Luke 22 and
[49:05] 42 saying father if thou be willing
[49:08] remove this cup from me
[49:10] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[49:14] done what's he showing he's showing the
[49:15] example of what a Christian's going to
[49:17] be like in every situation Lord this job
[49:20] looks perfect for me look at all the
[49:21] money I'm going to be making I know I'm
[49:23] going to have to miss Wednesday Lord not
[49:25] my will but thy will be done Lord I Lord
[49:29] I know that you know that this this boy
[49:32] ain't exactly where he needs to be but
[49:33] he really likes me and I really like him
[49:35] and we want to
[49:36] get not my will but thy will be done
[49:42] John 5 and 30 I can of my own self do
[49:45] nothing as I hear I judge and my
[49:47] judgment is just because I seek not my
[49:50] own will but the will of the Father
[49:52] which has sent me if I bear witness of
[49:55] myself no if I do what I want to
[49:58] do then my witness is not
[50:03] true here's what's missed in all the be
[50:06] true to yourself and and live your truth
[50:09] and and they're so worried about
[50:11] self-expressing and letting the world
[50:13] around them know who they are and what
[50:15] they are and what they're all about and
[50:16] what they stand for what they miss is
[50:19] that's not why we're here we're not here
[50:22] to express us you're not here to express
[50:25] you you are here to express him your
[50:29] life is to express Jesus Christ this
[50:32] isn't about bearing witness of me this
[50:35] isn't about bearing witness of you but
[50:37] it but it's about bearing witness to his
[50:40] glory amen and I know how I know how the
[50:44] world presents it I know how young
[50:45] people think is oh it robs you of your
[50:49] individualism it robs you of your
[50:51] ability to express yourself it it robs
[50:53] you of your ability to be who you are
[50:55] and and what you want to be it doesn't
[50:58] rob you of your
[50:59] individualism there ain't a one of us in
[51:01] here
[51:04] alike we're all different very
[51:08] different God is a god of variety
[51:11] creation shows that his choosing of the
[51:14] disciples shows that they were all so
[51:16] different they all acted different
[51:19] looked at things different thought about
[51:20] things different wrote
[51:22] differently you're you're always going
[51:24] to be you with your own personality and
[51:26] your own makeup and your own temperament
[51:29] your own disposition but placed in his
[51:31] hands you will be the best version of
[51:35] yourself oh I just want to be all I can
[51:37] be well then give all of yourself to
[51:40] Jesus I just want to be successful then
[51:42] give yourself to Jesus I want to make a
[51:45] mark then give yourself to Jesus and
[51:47] make a mark for Jesus do something that
[51:50] last do something that's Eternal cuz if
[51:52] you make a Mark here on this Earth it'll
[51:55] fade away it'll perish it'll burn nobody
[51:58] will remember your name but I got a name
[52:00] that's written in the Lamb's Book of
[52:02] Life that can't be forgotten that can't
[52:04] be erased it is eternal and I say make a
[52:07] mark for eternity tonight and give your
[52:10] life to Jesus
[52:14] Christ Hallelujah then your life will
[52:17] glorify his mercy and his grace it'll
[52:20] testify of his goodness and all that he
[52:22] has done for you because he alone is
[52:25] truth
[52:27] brother Bram says here God said this is
[52:29] my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased
[52:32] hear ye him and there he is the door the
[52:37] gate the way the truth and the life we
[52:42] can't say that enough tonight what way
[52:45] are you going because there's only one
[52:46] correct way what are you believing
[52:49] because there's only one real truth and
[52:51] that's Jesus Christ tonight I'm looking
[52:54] for happiness he's the only way to true
[52:56] happiness
[52:57] I'm searching for peace tonight he's the
[52:59] only way to true peace tonight he's the
[53:02] way to True PE peace he's the way to
[53:04] True Joy he's the way to True
[53:06] contentment and he's the way to your
[53:08] salvation tonight Hallelujah there is no
[53:11] other way he is the door that we all
[53:15] must come
[53:16] through I want to deal as I already said
[53:18] with with doors for a little while
[53:20] tonight because doors doors represent
[53:22] many different things and we won't be
[53:24] able to go into all of them or to speak
[53:26] to all of them but doors can represent
[53:30] beginnings and endings a lot of times
[53:32] you hear say well that that door closed
[53:34] on that chapter of my life that door
[53:36] closed and a new door opened there
[53:39] there's a there's a new beginning a new
[53:41] chapter in my life a new door has has
[53:43] opened and a door can represent a
[53:45] transition from one place to the
[53:47] next death itself is a doorway where
[53:50] where we leave this body and and and the
[53:53] pains and limitations of this life in
[53:55] order to enter into the eternals we
[53:58] don't often look at it that way you know
[54:00] but brother brandham even says I'm glad
[54:02] that there's something to get us out of
[54:04] this pest house he said there's an open
[54:07] door and it's called death Jesus stands
[54:10] in that door amen he'll guide me over
[54:13] the river he'll take me through that
[54:16] door listen I believe we're all living
[54:19] for the Rapture as none of us going
[54:20] woohoo I can't wait to go by the way of
[54:22] the grave but I'm just saying death's
[54:24] not something to be feared
[54:27] your soul is right it's just a doorway
[54:29] you're just one breath away from the
[54:31] eternals and brother brandom says he'll
[54:33] take me through the door the same God
[54:35] that seen you through every hardship
[54:37] every heartache every trial every time
[54:39] you didn't know oh what's going to
[54:41] happen he was there he'll be there for
[54:43] you in that time as
[54:46] well doors can mean different things
[54:48] depending on which side of the door
[54:50] you're
[54:51] on you know to those sealed locked out
[54:57] you don't like that door but to those
[54:59] sealed in it's your protection those
[55:03] inside the ark look at that door a lot
[55:05] different than those on the outside of
[55:06] the Ark when you're sleeping in your bed
[55:09] tonight you that door is a lot different
[55:11] to you than the person who might want to
[55:12] come into your house it it it matters
[55:15] which side of the door that you're on
[55:18] doors are often used to signify
[55:22] opportunity and this is where I want to
[55:24] settle in for a second here because
[55:27] tonight we have a great
[55:29] opportunity because the door to
[55:31] Salvation is here tonight and it's still
[55:34] open you're not looking at a closed door
[55:36] you're not listening to a sermon of Doom
[55:38] and Gloom I'm not here to tell you
[55:40] you're not going to make it I'm here to
[55:41] tell you the door is wide open to
[55:44] anybody who wants to get on board
[55:45] tonight it's still open tonight the door
[55:48] to the ark is still open the door to
[55:50] overcoming power is still open the door
[55:53] to Mercy and Grace the door to
[55:55] forgiveness is it's all wide open
[55:57] tonight in the house of God and this is
[56:00] an opportunity that we do not want to
[56:03] miss we get so excited about about so
[56:06] many things and so excited about
[56:08] opportunities that come our way but
[56:11] tonight we have the
[56:13] opportunity you have the opportunity to
[56:16] to open the door of your heart to open
[56:19] the door of your heart to the King of
[56:21] Kings and the Lord of lords whether
[56:23] you're saved or not whether you're
[56:26] filled or not he still comes by and
[56:28] knocks on your door there's still things
[56:30] he wants to impart to you there's still
[56:32] things he wants to deal with in your
[56:34] life and we all stand here tonight with
[56:37] the exact same opportunity an
[56:40] opportunity to let him in every door of
[56:44] your
[56:45] life brother Brandon would preach that
[56:47] door and a door and and he talked about
[56:50] how excited that people get to have the
[56:54] opportunity to meet certain people
[56:57] how excited we would be if someone
[56:59] famous knocked on our door now a lot of
[57:02] people are wired differently and a lot
[57:04] of people couldn't care
[57:06] less but the majority of
[57:10] people if the president depending on who
[57:12] that was knocked on your
[57:17] door it'd be I mean it'd be a cool story
[57:19] to tell you'd be excited about it
[57:22] president came to see him if the
[57:24] governor came to see you even even the
[57:26] mayor stops by your house you tell
[57:28] people man the mayor came by today or I
[57:30] I'll speak to to to some of us maybe who
[57:33] who like sports if your favorite ball
[57:35] star drove up and knocked on your
[57:40] door it gets real quiet cuz we got a lot
[57:43] of
[57:46] liars it's okay I said some of us I
[57:49] threw myself under the bus with
[57:51] you but if they knocked on your door how
[57:54] excited it would be can can you believe
[57:55] they're here can you believe they're
[57:58] visiting
[58:00] me and yet every single service the King
[58:03] of Kings and the Lord of lords the one
[58:07] who blew the universe off of his hand
[58:09] the one who came down and gave his life
[58:11] for you every single service comes by
[58:13] and he knocks and he knocks as the word
[58:16] Goes Forth as the spirit moves across

[1:00:59] Jesus Son of God King of Kings I say
[1:01:03] open your heart tonight but I'm saved
[1:01:05] brother and open all your heart tonight

[1:01:18] him in and then restrict his
[1:01:22] access don't let him in and say well
[1:01:24] don't don't don't meddle here in this
[1:01:28] part don't talk about that now
[1:01:31] preacher Lord don't deal with this don't
[1:01:33] meddle here I want you in my heart but
[1:01:36] but leave this part
[1:01:38] alone leave that part alone I I don't
[1:01:40] want to give up my
[1:01:43] attitude I don't want to give up my
[1:01:45] private life I don't want to give up my
[1:01:48] worldly
[1:01:49] entertainment whatever it is put
[1:01:51] whatever it is
[1:01:53] there I don't want to give up my GR
[1:01:58] judge I don't want to lay down my
[1:02:01] bitterness I don't want to lay down my
[1:02:07] stubbornness you know people don't want
[1:02:09] to lay things down because they feel
[1:02:10] like it empowers
[1:02:14] them we dealt with the spirit one time
[1:02:16] that told us the the person told us I
[1:02:21] don't want to be free from it because it
[1:02:23] gives me strength
[1:02:27] now that was an extreme
[1:02:31] example but we struggle to lay things
[1:02:33] down for if you really thought it was
[1:02:35] hurting you you'd let it
[1:02:39] go but you have a a like or a worship or
[1:02:43] an attachment to it that doesn't let you
[1:02:46] let it
[1:02:48] go but if you're going to get total
[1:02:50] Victory if you're going to live an
[1:02:52] overcoming life you're going to have to
[1:02:54] give him access to every door
[1:02:57] you're going to have to let him in every
[1:02:58] part that's how you overcome you give it
[1:03:01] all to him you hold nothing back and
[1:03:03] it's all wrapping up we've already said
[1:03:05] it it's all wrapping up all around us we
[1:03:07] can see it we can feel it we can sense
[1:03:09] it and if you're going to make it you
[1:03:11] got to be all
[1:03:13] in or you got to let him all
[1:03:17] in you got to quit holding back and turn
[1:03:20] things loose and it's a wonderful
[1:03:22] opportunity that we have tonight the
[1:03:25] world presents us with opportunities
[1:03:26] every single
[1:03:28] day but not every door listen to me not
[1:03:32] every door is one you should walk
[1:03:35] through not every opportunity is one you
[1:03:38] should take that's one thing that's hard
[1:03:40] to get I I want to say young people I
[1:03:41] just say people we just look at this
[1:03:43] opportunity look it's an opportunity I
[1:03:45] get to do this I get to do that and it's
[1:03:48] never placed in the scales it's just go

[1:03:52] this I'm G to do I'm Gonna Take This Job
[1:03:54] this job is more money I'm going to do
[1:03:55] this I'm going to and it's never weighed
[1:03:57] out not every opportunity is an
[1:04:00] opportunity you should
[1:04:01] take not every door that's open is a
[1:04:04] door that you should walk through not
[1:04:07] not all roads that are open are good
[1:04:09] roads to drive
[1:04:10] down listen there's an open road and a
[1:04:13] wide open gate that leads to
[1:04:16] destruction that's an easy one to travel
[1:04:19] on not all freedom is real freedom
[1:04:26] but there is a real Freedom here
[1:04:29] tonight you're wanting something more
[1:04:31] you feel like you're cooped up and I I
[1:04:33] need to experience real Freedom you need
[1:04:35] to give more and you'll find more
[1:04:36] freedom than you've ever known there is
[1:04:38] a real joy in the house of God tonight
[1:04:41] there is real overcoming there is real
[1:04:43] Deliverance there is real power and it's
[1:04:45] here in the house of God tonight for you
[1:04:47] if you'll lay aside your wants and your
[1:04:49] desires and what you want and your pride
[1:04:51] and your ideas say Lord I'm opening it
[1:04:53] all up to you tonight I want that
[1:04:56] freedom that comes with the baptism of
[1:04:58] the Holy
[1:05:00] Ghost
[1:05:01] Hallelujah but you got to enter in at
[1:05:03] the door and open up your heart then
[1:05:06] you're going to have that freedom that
[1:05:07] you've always longed for remember you
[1:05:10] have to open your heart to him in order
[1:05:12] for him to take
[1:05:13] over but it's the same thing for the
[1:05:18] Devil the devil can't take over if you
[1:05:21] don't open up to him devil can't come in
[1:05:24] if you don't open up to him
[1:05:26] a lot of what we deal with in the issues
[1:05:28] we face in the battles we fight are
[1:05:30] because we open ourselves up to an
[1:05:35] influence and that influence itself
[1:05:37] might not have been that big a
[1:05:41] deal you might not have seen what was
[1:05:43] wrong with
[1:05:45] that but it was an influence that began
[1:05:48] to worm its way into your life and
[1:05:50] change your thinking just a
[1:05:53] little we talk about it with guns and
[1:05:55] and shooting guns or bows or whatever
[1:05:57] you shoot but if it's off just one
[1:06:00] tick it ain't going to be very far off
[1:06:03] if you're not going very far but the
[1:06:05] further you go down the road the wider
[1:06:08] and wider and wider and wider it gets
[1:06:11] and you're right here and the word of
[1:06:12] God's right here and you're going it's
[1:06:14] not that big a deal you ain't even on
[1:06:16] the same
[1:06:17] path you're not even on the same road
[1:06:20] it's a big deal because an influence got
[1:06:23] in and began to work in your life
[1:06:26] we allowed something in that we should
[1:06:28] have kept out we opened a door to it and
[1:06:31] now now maybe that thing has you
[1:06:34] bound but he's a door of Deliverance
[1:06:38] Tonight Deliverance is at your door
[1:06:41] tonight are you going to open to that
[1:06:44] knocking he's the door of Freedom
[1:06:46] tonight if you're bound up the prison
[1:06:48] bars is already open Johnny Crow all you
[1:06:51] got to do is walk out tonight there's
[1:06:53] freedom for you tonight and he's telling

[1:06:58] door is open come inside the sheep fold
[1:07:01] is open come on in quit staying half in
[1:07:04] and half out I said it before if you're

[1:07:08] to be all the way
[1:07:12] out he is the door to the sheep fold and
[1:07:15] he's offering you entrance
[1:07:17] tonight he says and this is his word
[1:07:21] primarily this is the foundation and
[1:07:24] every Church every Born Again person is
[1:07:26] built upon this Foundation Jesus Christ
[1:07:29] the Chief Cornerstone and he's the gate
[1:07:32] the door of entrance to all Eternal
[1:07:34] blessings he is the gate and the door to
[1:07:37] the
[1:07:39] Sheepfold he's the one that can offer
[1:07:42] you forgiveness tonight what it say I I

[1:07:50] ain't shut the door he's offering you
[1:07:52] entrance he hasn't shut the door he's
[1:07:56] offering you his protection but in order
[1:07:58] to get it you got to come inside the
[1:08:01] Sheepfold we got too many people living
[1:08:04] in the
[1:08:09] doorway to to make an example pardon me
[1:08:12] for a
[1:08:15] second well this has a code
[1:08:18] still there
[1:08:20] we we got too many people living right
[1:08:23] here on and they can see the blessings
[1:08:28] they can partake of the
[1:08:29] blessings but they can't be sealed in
[1:08:32] because they're standing in the way of
[1:08:34] the
[1:08:35] door and they can see the blessings they
[1:08:37] can taste it and they can worship and
[1:08:39] they can grab their worldly stuff too
[1:08:40] right here on this
[1:08:42] side you got to quit living right
[1:08:45] here because let me tell you the way the
[1:08:47] hinge goes is one of these days the door
[1:08:48] is going to
[1:08:52] shut and it has a lot different meaning
[1:08:54] than when it shuts on this side when it
[1:08:56] shuts on this side you're sealed in
[1:08:58] you're safe you're secure you're
[1:09:00] heavenbound you're going to the eternals
[1:09:02] you're going to go to the marriage
[1:09:03] supper of the Lamb don't be sealed on
[1:09:06] that side of the door get out of the
[1:09:08] doorway get in the Sheepfold
[1:09:13] tonight
[1:09:15] Hallelujah living in that place where
[1:09:17] you can't be sealed in but you're
[1:09:19] getting enough blessings to lie to
[1:09:21] yourself getting enough blessings to
[1:09:23] fool yourself still com able with the
[1:09:26] world still comfortable with how they
[1:09:27] talk still comfortable with how they act
[1:09:30] still comfortable with your attitude
[1:09:31] still comfortable
[1:09:33] lying still comfortable in
[1:09:36] unbelief but once you get inside then
[1:09:38] the world is sealed
[1:09:40] out get inside and get sin sealed out
[1:09:43] and get get get unbelief sealed out get
[1:09:45] the devil sealed
[1:09:47] out Hallelujah and begin dwelling in a
[1:09:50] spiritual atmosphere I love how brother
[1:09:52] Ben brought that out on Sunday begin to
[1:09:54] dwell in a spiritual atmosphere where
[1:09:56] your thoughts are never too far from him
[1:10:00] that he can't come and deal with your
[1:10:01] heart where he can't come and speak to
[1:10:03] you but when you live in a leot Dean
[1:10:07] atmosphere then you live in the realm of
[1:10:12] why why is that
[1:10:15] wrong wh what's wrong with that I I
[1:10:19] don't see the big deal but see the
[1:10:22] problem is when you're living in that
[1:10:23] atmosphere it never stops at one one I
[1:10:26] don't see the big
[1:10:29] deal but what happens is suddenly you
[1:10:32] don't see the big deal about anything
[1:10:35] and then your whole life becomes full of
[1:10:38] it's not a big deal it's not a big deal
[1:10:40] it's not a big deal it's not a big deal
[1:10:41] it's not a big deal and it Stacks up
[1:10:43] into a really really really big deal a
[1:10:48] lukewarm backsliding condition full of
[1:10:50] the influences of Leota more than the
[1:10:52] influences of God
[1:10:55] because one big no big deal becomes
[1:10:57] hundreds of them it becomes your life
[1:10:59] and then what ends up happening is this
[1:11:01] isn't a big deal and then church isn't a
[1:11:04] big deal and then prayer isn't a big
[1:11:08] deal and then you're just drifting
[1:11:10] aimlessly without an anchor it's a big
[1:11:15] deal it's a really big
[1:11:17] deal and it's bigger deal now than it's
[1:11:20] ever been before cuz we're right here
[1:11:21] when the door is
[1:11:23] shutting the problem is is that we're
[1:11:26] deciding how to
[1:11:28] live and we're judging right and wrong
[1:11:30] and what we should do and shouldn't do
[1:11:32] the exact same way the world does I
[1:11:34] don't feel like this is
[1:11:36] wrong or I don't feel like this is a
[1:11:38] problem or I don't think or I don't see
[1:11:43] or my personal favorite my heart doesn't
[1:11:46] convict
[1:11:49] me let's go to the scripture the heart
[1:11:53] is deceitful
[1:11:55] above all things your heart will lie to
[1:11:59] you quicker than anything
[1:12:04] ever and desperately now this is the
[1:12:08] thing you're wanting to lean on my heart
[1:12:09] doesn't condemn me
[1:12:13] wicked who can know
[1:12:16] it today I've decided to take leadership
[1:12:19] from a very deceitful and wicked thing
[1:12:20] and I think that's a wise
[1:12:22] decision no
[1:12:26] who can know it it's wicked it's
[1:12:28] deceitful how do you live how do you
[1:12:31] make decisions by the word of God you
[1:12:35] ask God to guide you you seek what
[1:12:37] pleases God the heart can only ever be
[1:12:40] trusted when he is in complete 100%
[1:12:44] control of the heart and he's the king
[1:12:47] of the heart and he's sitting on the
[1:12:48] throne of the heart and really what
[1:12:49] you're trusting is the leadership of the
[1:12:51] Holy Ghost and not your heart
[1:12:55] when every door is open but I find that
[1:12:59] people don't think something's that big
[1:13:01] a deal when it's something they really
[1:13:06] like so their heart gets easily swayed
[1:13:09] by their
[1:13:11] desires I convinced my heart it was okay
[1:13:14] so let's do
[1:13:15] it because it's something you wanted to
[1:13:18] do all
[1:13:20] alone we've all been there I've been
[1:13:22] there I'll speak for
[1:13:24] me you got to bring it back to this you
[1:13:27] got to bring it back to Holy Ghost
[1:13:29] leadership it's time to open up every
[1:13:31] door of your heart tonight it's time to
[1:13:33] come God's provided way give him your
[1:13:36] everything and it's got to be done his
[1:13:39] way not your way not well I believe the
[1:13:43] message not I go to church every service
[1:13:46] so does the devil I'm glad you do you
[1:13:50] should this isn't to knock that but
[1:13:53] there will be no perfect attendance of
[1:13:55] WS in
[1:13:57] heaven this person lived pretty terrible
[1:14:00] never did overcome but we'd like to
[1:14:01] congratulate them they made 37 years in
[1:14:03] a row never missed a service here's your
[1:14:05] seat at the banquet it's not
[1:14:10] happening that's not God's provided way
[1:14:14] the way he provided is through the New
[1:14:16] Birth the way he provided is the baptism
[1:14:19] of the Holy Ghost he said oh God now
[1:14:22] this great dark ey were just before the
[1:14:24] most glor global global war that ever
[1:14:27] struck the peace while the power of the
[1:14:29] holy spirit is just moving in the land
[1:14:31] just as it was in the days of Noah men
[1:14:33] and women being persuaded today to come
[1:14:35] to Christ Jesus enter in at the door at
[1:14:38] the Straight Gate be
[1:14:42] born in the
[1:14:45] Kingdom you got to come the provided way
[1:14:49] we all know the parable we're going to
[1:14:50] look at it for a moment Matthew 22:11
[1:14:53] says and when the king came came in to
[1:14:55] see the guest he saw there a man which
[1:14:58] had not a wedding
[1:15:00] garment and he saith unto him friend how
[1:15:03] camest thou in hither not having a
[1:15:05] wedding garment now we know that the
[1:15:07] wedding garment is the baptism of the
[1:15:09] Holy
[1:15:10] Ghost and he was
[1:15:13] speechless listen you you won't even be
[1:15:16] able to say your excuses on that
[1:15:20] day you won't be able to utter a word of
[1:15:24] excuse
[1:15:26] but you'll be
[1:15:29] speechless then said the king to the
[1:15:31] servants bind him hand in foot take him
[1:15:34] away and cast him into outer Darkness
[1:15:36] there shall be weeping and nashing of
[1:15:40] teeth so we know that the wedding
[1:15:42] garment was the baptism of the Holy
[1:15:43] Ghost and and in those days what would
[1:15:46] happen just briefly as you as you came
[1:15:47] in everyone came through the same
[1:15:50] door and when you came through that door
[1:15:54] you your feet would be washed and they
[1:15:56] would put perfume on you and they would
[1:15:57] put a a wedding garment on
[1:16:01] you and by that what it did is it
[1:16:04] eliminated differences there was no
[1:16:05] difference in the rich there was no
[1:16:07] difference in the poor there was no big
[1:16:08] eyes there was no little yous the it
[1:16:11] eliminated the differences between race
[1:16:12] it eliminated
[1:16:15] everything but it showed that they had
[1:16:17] been invited and that they had come the
[1:16:20] proper way that they came through the
[1:16:23] door so all the guest had the same
[1:16:26] garment on and when the king found this
[1:16:29] guest there without the Garment on he
[1:16:31] knew that he had come some other way
[1:16:35] maybe a back window maybe a back door
[1:16:38] maybe he had tried to slip in when when
[1:16:39] nobody was
[1:16:40] looking but brother brandham says he
[1:16:43] called him
[1:16:45] friend verse 12 friend he says this
[1:16:49] shows that he was a church member
[1:16:55] he said it shows that this was a church
[1:16:59] member brother Brown tells us he's got a
[1:17:01] way today and it's the way of Calvary
[1:17:04] and you say well I believe that brother
[1:17:06] brandham well if you have and come by
[1:17:09] the door you've got to receive the Holy
[1:17:13] Ghost truly it's the only way it's the
[1:17:17] only way that you're going to make it in
[1:17:20] what what am I preaching tonight you're
[1:17:22] preaching you're preaching hard tonight
[1:17:23] no no no I'm just saying tonight we
[1:17:25] can't be just church members that's all
[1:17:28] if we can sum up this first part you
[1:17:29] can't just be a church member you can't
[1:17:31] just show up and think you're going to
[1:17:33] make it but you got to surrender
[1:17:34] everything to him you got to be filled
[1:17:36] with his life you got to get deity on
[1:17:38] the inside oh how do I do that you just
[1:17:40] surrender you Just Surrender and you
[1:17:42] repent and be baptized and you shall
[1:17:45] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost

[1:20:11] you're not going to lose a one he's not
[1:20:14] going to lose a one he knows who his
[1:20:16] sheep are and he counts them and if
[1:20:18] there's one missing he says I'll go get
[1:20:19] them I don't care how far I got to go
[1:20:22] you don't know how far away my kid is it
[1:20:24] don't matter how far he's got to go he
[1:20:26] looks around and goes they're not all in
[1:20:29] I'm going after them tonight mercy and
[1:20:31] Grace is on their Trail tonight Jesus
[1:20:34] Christ is on their Trail tonight and
[1:20:35] there's nobody better than the mighty
[1:20:37] conqueror the King of Kings to be going
[1:20:40] after your loved ones
[1:20:41] tonight he knows who are
[1:20:44] his and then once you were inside the
[1:20:47] Sheepfold he literally becomes the door
[1:20:51] because he lays across the doorway
[1:20:53] that's what the Shepherds do they lay
[1:20:55] across the doorway so nothing can get to
[1:20:57] you there unless they come through him I
[1:21:00] like my odds pretty good you mean you
[1:21:02] got to go through the King of Kings you
[1:21:03] mean you got to go through the mighty
[1:21:05] conqueror to get to me I think I'll
[1:21:07] sleep well tonight I think I'll be safe
[1:21:09] tonight I think I can lay my head at
[1:21:11] rest tonight the world's falling apart
[1:21:13] but the King of Kings is in the doorway
[1:21:15] tonight watching over me because I came
[1:21:18] into the
[1:21:20] Sheepfold
[1:21:22] Hallelujah the devil can't get in and
[1:21:24] sheep can't get
[1:21:26] out how secure and happy we should be
[1:21:29] tonight he is the door to the fold he's
[1:21:33] the one fighting the
[1:21:34] Wolves
[1:21:37] Hallelujah open your heart tonight and
[1:21:39] let him
[1:21:41] work open the doors and let him
[1:21:44] move cuz we all have to have the wedding
[1:21:47] garment I'm going to turn just a bit
[1:21:51] here the wedding garment
[1:21:55] what is the wedding garment we know it's
[1:21:57] the baptism of the Holy Ghost getting
[1:21:59] people reformed isn't the
[1:22:02] Garment getting people a lot of head
[1:22:04] knowledge and teaching them the message
[1:22:05] isn't the Garment getting people to
[1:22:08] accept the truth of the word is not the
[1:22:11] Garment but the wedding garment is the
[1:22:14] new birth it's the baptism of the Holy
[1:22:16] Ghost just like they had at
[1:22:18] Pentecost and that's why that's why we
[1:22:22] continually have and will continually
[1:22:25] preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost we
[1:22:27] must continue to offer the opportunity
[1:22:30] for people to be born again I don't care
[1:22:32] how long you've been here I don't care
[1:22:33] how much you believe the message I'm
[1:22:35] going to keep offering you the
[1:22:36] opportunity to be born again amen we
[1:22:40] must continue to preach that the door of
[1:22:42] power is open in this day what happened
[1:22:45] was down through the the the years the
[1:22:47] the New Birth the truth of the new birth
[1:22:49] was lost and but once again with with
[1:22:51] the revelation of the hour and the
[1:22:53] restoration of the fullness of the word
[1:22:54] what we have is the opportunity to
[1:22:57] receive the true baptism of the Holy
[1:23:00] Ghost just like they did in the upper
[1:23:02] room in this day this day a door was
[1:23:08] open to us that was closed to the other
[1:23:13] ages I just Googled what does it mean
[1:23:16] when a door has been
[1:23:18] opened it says when someone says a door
[1:23:21] has been open it means that a new
[1:23:22] opportunity has presented itself
[1:23:25] allowing access to something previously
[1:23:28] unavailable or difficult to
[1:23:31] achieve and the door there being a
[1:23:34] barrier that had kept people out but in
[1:23:37] this day that door has come open and in
[1:23:40] this day the Mysteries were revealed and
[1:23:42] in our day Satan was shown to only be a
[1:23:44] bluff and in our day the power of God
[1:23:47] was put on
[1:23:48] display in this day it's the open door
[1:23:52] of word and Power right brother Bram
[1:23:56] teaches
[1:23:57] us in the church ages about the blending
[1:24:00] of Ages and how the seventh age is
[1:24:02] actually just a continuation of the
[1:24:05] sixth and I tell you that because I'm
[1:24:07] going to use some quotes from the sixth
[1:24:08] age
[1:24:10] here and he says this age particularly
[1:24:13] flows into the next age so here we are
[1:24:15] we have flowed in and not only does this
[1:24:18] age overflow into the last age but the
[1:24:20] last age is in many respects simply a
[1:24:23] carrying on of the sixth
[1:24:27] age and it was in this sixth age that we
[1:24:29] read in Revelation 3 at the very
[1:24:31] beginning where he said I have set a
[1:24:32] door before Thee I have set before thee
[1:24:35] an open door and no man can shut it and
[1:24:38] we'll get more into that Friday night in
[1:24:40] our church age study but but brother
[1:24:41] Bram talks about the age and he pays it
[1:24:44] some wonderful
[1:24:45] compliments as he says they opened up
[1:24:48] many doors during that age the door to
[1:24:51] the gospel the door to the mission
[1:24:52] fields that the door that to Christ and
[1:24:55] everything was opened up during that age
[1:24:58] and you can see what they did the
[1:25:00] Brethren done a great job of it they
[1:25:05] done a great job of it if you read the
[1:25:07] whole thing you find out what they done
[1:25:09] a great job of they done a great job of
[1:25:11] spreading the
[1:25:13] word now notice we're back to this
[1:25:15] thought we want to get people in the
[1:25:17] wedding garment we want to get people to
[1:25:20] the baptism of the Holy Ghost we want to
[1:25:22] get people to the original Pentecost
[1:25:24] right we want to get people all the way
[1:25:26] in so how do we do that brother Aaron
[1:25:28] well we just give them the word we just
[1:25:31] say that God sent a prophet we just tell
[1:25:33] them believe the message brother Bram
[1:25:35] says for the past 150 years talking
[1:25:38] about back into that age great
[1:25:40] missionaries like no other time or age
[1:25:42] before has covered the entire Earth
[1:25:45] people say that you know that people all
[1:25:47] over the worth ain't heard about Jesus
[1:25:48] brother Brown says it covered the entire
[1:25:50] Earth think of that every nation under
[1:25:53] the heavens has heard the
[1:25:54] word it's just what the prophet
[1:25:58] said it completed many many many many
[1:26:01] years ago see but not the
[1:26:05] gospel just the
[1:26:07] word the letter kth but the spirit
[1:26:11] giveth life see he goes on to say the
[1:26:15] power of the spirit was missing in that
[1:26:18] age the word was well
[1:26:21] preached think about that he does say
[1:26:24] man they were off they were off their
[1:26:26] doctrines were off they didn't have it
[1:26:29] right he said the word was well preached
[1:26:32] the power of the spirit was
[1:26:34] missing think about
[1:26:36] it so we can't just get them back to the
[1:26:41] word or they would have
[1:26:45] raptured you can't just get them to the
[1:26:48] word you got to get them to a new
[1:26:51] birth he says it would have been
[1:26:54] wonderful if this Open Door had followed
[1:26:57] the Divine
[1:26:59] pattern of
[1:27:01] Pentecost this age had the word but they
[1:27:04] didn't follow the Divine pattern of
[1:27:07] Pentecost well what is that what is the
[1:27:09] Divine pattern of Pentecost it's the new
[1:27:10] birth it's Mark 16 in action it's the
[1:27:13] power of God manifested it's Devils cast
[1:27:15] out it's the sick being healed it's
[1:27:17] signs following them that
[1:27:20] believe he goes on to
[1:27:22] say Paul say the gospel didn't come in
[1:27:25] word only but through Power and
[1:27:27] manifestations of the Holy Ghost then
[1:27:29] when Jesus said go into all the world
[1:27:30] and preach the gospel he said go into
[1:27:32] all the world and
[1:27:34] demonstrate oh I like that demonstrate
[1:27:37] the power of the Gospel taking the word
[1:27:41] that what it says and show the people
[1:27:43] what it says and then make it manifest
[1:27:45] to
[1:27:47] them and then he tells us this he gave
[1:27:50] us the open door of word and
[1:27:54] power and that is what we are supposed
[1:27:57] to
[1:27:58] use that is what gave Paul his great and
[1:28:01] effective Ministry 1 Corinthians 2:4 and
[1:28:04] my speech and my preaching was not with
[1:28:06] enticing words of man's Wisdom but in
[1:28:08] demonstration of the spirit and of
[1:28:12] power yes we preach the word but it has
[1:28:16] to come in power and demonstration
[1:28:18] otherwise it does nothing but make
[1:28:19] people realize they're
[1:28:21] lost it doesn't transform a life
[1:28:25] it doesn't change them it doesn't save
[1:28:27] them all it can do is tell them you're
[1:28:29] lost you're
[1:28:32] lost I need something to change my life
[1:28:36] I need something to give me overcoming
[1:28:38] power I need the open door of the word
[1:28:41] and power tonight amen he gave us the
[1:28:44] open door of word and Power in this day
[1:28:46] and he says that's what we're supposed
[1:28:47] to use may it never be said of us that
[1:28:50] the word was well preached but Power was
[1:28:53] lacking all right come on what I'm
[1:28:56] telling you tonight is your God isn't
[1:28:58] powerless this one I'm telling you to
[1:29:00] run to this door I'm telling you get
[1:29:02] inside of this sheep fold I'm telling
[1:29:04] you to go the ark the door it's not
[1:29:06] powerless but he's a living God he's a
[1:29:09] god of of Miracles he's a god of the
[1:29:11] supernatural this is a door of power
[1:29:13] this is a door of Victory it's a door
[1:29:15] that conquers
[1:29:17] circumstances Hallelujah this word has
[1:29:19] life in
[1:29:21] it it's not a dead word it's a word with
[1:29:24] power in it it'll change your life give
[1:29:27] it a chance it'll deliver the bound
[1:29:29] it'll heal the sick I'm not telling you
[1:29:31] to run into something tonight that
[1:29:33] you're going to have to run out of a few
[1:29:34] months later when it starts crumbling
[1:29:36] down this is an eternal Kingdom this is
[1:29:38] a powerful Kingdom this is an almighty
[1:29:40] God get inside of it and get through the
[1:29:43] door of Victory and watch your life
[1:29:44] blossom in his
[1:29:46] presence Hallelujah this is a permanent
[1:29:50] fix this is a sin cure tonight this is
[1:29:53] overcoming power the door of word and
[1:29:56] power has been opened and we are to use
[1:29:59] it I say it's enough of letting the
[1:30:02] bound stay chained up I say it's enough
[1:30:05] of self-help and psychology I say it's
[1:30:08] enough of living with Devils I say let's
[1:30:10] operate in the open door of the word and
[1:30:13] in power and right let's turn it loose
[1:30:16] in our lives tonight let's believe it
[1:30:18] let's let our faith raise up and say
[1:30:19] they don't have to stay bound they don't
[1:30:21] have to stay sick I don't have to be
[1:30:23] beat down my children don't have to go
[1:30:25] to hell there is an open door tonight of
[1:30:28] power and I'm going to step through that
[1:30:30] word I'm going to step into that
[1:30:33] door
[1:30:35] Hallelujah let's operate in the door
[1:30:37] that's been opened to us listen the Holy
[1:30:40] Ghost may be out of style and it may be
[1:30:42] ridiculed and mocked by many but it's
[1:30:44] still God's provided
[1:30:47] way he talks about
[1:30:52] this talks about people without
[1:30:55] power and he says that's just about all
[1:30:57] the strength the Christian multitudes
[1:30:59] have because the word was not brought to
[1:31:01] them by the original Open Door of
[1:31:09] Pentecost you say I'm I'm going through
[1:31:12] hell right now brother Aaron I know a
[1:31:14] man that can open that
[1:31:16] door he showed up there one afternoon
[1:31:19] after he died on the cross and he didn't
[1:31:20] show up to hang out he didn't show up to
[1:31:22] stick around he showed up to take over
[1:31:25] the devil the devil began to talk to I
[1:31:27] love how brother Brown illustrates and
[1:31:28] says yeah I got you now just like he
[1:31:30] says to many of you tonight I got you
[1:31:32] now Jesus said I'm the Virgin born son
[1:31:35] of the Living God my blood is still wet
[1:31:38] on the cross I paid the price and I've
[1:31:40] come to tell you you've already lost the
[1:31:42] battle you've robbed long enough you've
[1:31:44] tormented long enough and now I have
[1:31:46] come down to take over I love how
[1:31:48] brother brand says he reached and he
[1:31:50] grabbed the keys of death and hell and
[1:31:52] he kicked him back in gave the door a
[1:31:54] good slam hallelujah what situation do
[1:31:57] you have that's worse than hell tonight
[1:31:59] I say he has showed up for your
[1:32:01] situation and he has showed up to take
[1:32:03] over he's come down where you're at and
[1:32:05] he says I'm here to take over I'll take
[1:32:08] over your heartache I'll take over your
[1:32:10] sickness I'll take over your depression
[1:32:13] I'll conquer death hell in the grave and

[1:32:41] yeah I got so choked up reading this
[1:32:44] spirit of God moved in just it's a
[1:32:46] simplest little
[1:32:48] quote says there they are the Old
[1:32:50] Testament Saints laying there waiting to
[1:32:52] be clothed upon in
[1:32:54] Paradise he opened the door and Abraham

[1:34:21] with chains of circumstance I'm Bound in
[1:34:23] sins I'm Bound in Pride I'm Bound by an
[1:34:25] evil spirit that's okay Peter was bound
[1:34:27] one night and the same Pillar of Fire
[1:34:29] that's in this building right now came
[1:34:31] into the prison cell and in one moment
[1:34:33] his shackles fell off in one moment he
[1:34:35] was free what am I telling you tonight
[1:34:37] I'm not here to beat you over the head
[1:34:39] cuz you're bound I'm telling you it's a
[1:34:40] freedom night Let Freedom Ring in the
[1:34:42] house of God let your shackles fall off
[1:34:44] and experience true freedom in the Holy
[1:34:47] Ghost he's here to deliver it's the same
[1:34:50] Pillar of
[1:34:51] Fire Hallelujah
[1:34:54] the open door of
[1:34:56] power we're supposed to be operating
[1:34:58] like that he says the seventh age is a
[1:35:01] very short age gathers
[1:35:03] itself into itself for one quick work
[1:35:06] all the evil of every age and yet all
[1:35:09] the
[1:35:10] reality of
[1:35:13] Pentecost don't tell me I'm not supposed
[1:35:15] to go back to that he said that's what
[1:35:18] the seventh age would
[1:35:21] be the reality of Pentecost I'm not
[1:35:25] talking about emotion I'm talking about
[1:35:27] overcoming power I'm talking about deity
[1:35:30] coming and living on the inside of you
[1:35:32] we're talking about God manifesting
[1:35:33] himself in your flesh we're talking
[1:35:35] about Satan being cast down by you
[1:35:38] tonight
[1:35:39] Hallelujah he says now notice if America
[1:35:42] would receive God's gift it would be a
[1:35:44] golden age for
[1:35:46] us and I'm just going try to wrap this
[1:35:49] up so if you'll just bear with me for a
[1:35:50] few
[1:35:51] minutes if all of the American churches
[1:35:53] would accept God's gift what is God's
[1:35:56] gift to the church the Holy
[1:36:00] Ghost he says now in any time that God
[1:36:04] ever sent a gift to the world and the
[1:36:06] people received it it was a golden age
[1:36:08] for them but when they rejected they
[1:36:11] went into chaos and disaster into
[1:36:13] punishment now you Bible historians just
[1:36:15] speak with one time and if they ever
[1:36:17] rejected God's gift and his signs they
[1:36:20] never prospered brother brand says in
[1:36:23] night 1965 that he said that if God had
[1:36:25] given him the choice of when he could
[1:36:27] come and preach on the earth he would
[1:36:29] have chose this age he said because it's
[1:36:32] the Golden Age and why do you keep
[1:36:35] saying that brother Heron focusing on
[1:36:36] the golden age because something is only
[1:36:40] referred to as a golden age when it's
[1:36:41] the most flourishing period in history
[1:36:44] for whatever you're talking about they
[1:36:46] say things like the Golden Age of
[1:36:48] literature the Golden Age of
[1:36:50] civilization what does it mean when
[1:36:52] something was at its abs abolute
[1:36:55] Peak this is the Golden Age of the power
[1:37:00] of God it's not the time to settle for
[1:37:03] less it's not the time to back off your
[1:37:05] promises and and quit looking for
[1:37:07] miracles it's not the time for his
[1:37:08] manifestations of power to be lacking
[1:37:10] this is the Golden
[1:37:12] Age and yet for many people it is
[1:37:16] lacking a lot of folks living under that
[1:37:18] indictment of the sixth age where the
[1:37:20] word the word is well preached but the
[1:37:22] power of the spirit spirit is
[1:37:24] missing he said that he opens and no man
[1:37:28] shuts he opened the door of word and
[1:37:31] power and yet some have tried to close
[1:37:35] it I thought of this scripture as I was
[1:37:37] thinking about that but woe unto you
[1:37:38] scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you
[1:37:40] shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against
[1:37:42] men you neither go in yourselves neither
[1:37:44] suffer you them that are entering to go
[1:37:48] in not only do they not want it they
[1:37:50] want to criticize you and mock you for
[1:37:51] experiencing the Holy Ghost
[1:37:54] not only they try to shut it down for
[1:37:55] themselves but they try to shut it down
[1:37:56] for everybody else and in some places
[1:37:59] Even in our own ranks he's standing
[1:38:01] outside the door saying can I come in
[1:38:04] can I manifest myself in your church is
[1:38:06] that okay will you be offended if I
[1:38:08] begin to manifest there can I move in
[1:38:10] your service tonight will that be okay
[1:38:13] can I heal there can I can I do the
[1:38:14] miraculous
[1:38:16] there and they shut the door to the
[1:38:19] miraculous and they've shut the door to
[1:38:20] the gifts and they've shut the door to
[1:38:21] the supernatural
[1:38:23] but I want to tell you this they've only
[1:38:24] shut it for
[1:38:26] themselves they've only shut it for
[1:38:28] themselves Jonah 2:8 says they that
[1:38:30] observe lying vanities forsake their own
[1:38:34] mercies brother brand tells says don't
[1:38:36] be led astray by listening to those that
[1:38:37] deny the power of the word and deny that
[1:38:40] Jesus saves heals fills with the Holy
[1:38:42] Ghost and power you are God's free men
[1:38:45] loosed by his blood I'd like to say
[1:38:47] tonight that that door I don't care how
[1:38:49] much they try to close it is still open

[1:39:22] spirit and that day of gross Darkness
