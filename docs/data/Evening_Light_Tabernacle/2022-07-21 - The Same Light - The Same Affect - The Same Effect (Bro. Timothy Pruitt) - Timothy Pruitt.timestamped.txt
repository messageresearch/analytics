[19:37] lord they come from the depths of our
[19:39] hearts
[19:40] lord when these things are mentioned
[19:41] over the pulpit lord we're asking for
[19:44] people to be able to enter into prayer
[19:46] with one another
[19:47] lord we want those prayers to reach up
[19:49] to heaven lord
[19:50] we know that you hear us father in the
[19:52] time of need
[19:54] lord we know that these things aren't
[19:56] taken lightly
[19:57] [Music]
[19:58] lord that someone could go to a doctor
[20:00] and
[20:01] someone could maybe get a prescription
[20:03] lord and they could follow those
[20:05] directions
[20:06] father but when we take these things to
[20:08] you lord
[20:09] we know that you know what we have need

[20:22] times lord when there's
[20:24] serious needs and we may put those in
[20:26] ranking order more serious than others

[20:30] lord they're a need that all of us can
[20:32] share in lord and we're asking tonight
[20:35] lord for those cancer requests
[20:37] lord you've heard them many times father

[20:45] amongst the world father that even when
[20:48] we've asked several times lord you know
[20:49] that perfect time that come on the scene

[20:58] could even be in someone's car father
[21:00] where you actually come down lord and
[21:02] meet that need and then a praise report
[21:05] comes

[21:18] lord we don't just
[21:19] say that these are big prayer requests
[21:21] or small prayer requests lord but
[21:22] anything that comes from deep within

[21:29] himself aside today lord and

[41:56] last time but they only found one very
[41:58] small one
[41:59] the doctor liked to switch to a
[42:00] different medication to try and further
[42:03] reduce the inflammation
[42:04] in the large intestine in the next few
[42:06] weeks but isaac is doing awesome came
[42:09] through it all like a champ we want to
[42:11] thank you all for your prayers and we're
[42:13] still believing and we're thanking god
[42:15] for his good report and believing for a
[42:18] complete healing
[42:20] amen so we thank the lord for that
[42:29] amen he truly is a great god
[42:32] amen let's turn our bibles to acts
[42:34] chapter 2
[42:36] and verse 1.
[42:38] i want to kind of skip through here for
[42:40] uh i love to read all of it but
[42:43] we're very familiar with this scripture
[42:46] amen i believe it's
[42:48] it's very much as applicable to us
[42:51] and the time that we're living in
[42:53] it says here and when the day of
[42:55] pentecost was fully come
[42:57] they were all in one accord and in one
[42:59] place
[43:00] and suddenly they came a sound from
[43:02] heaven
[43:03] as a rushing mighty wind
[43:05] and it filled all in the house where
[43:08] they were sitting and there appeared
[43:10] unto them cloven tongues like as unto
[43:13] fire and it set upon each of them and
[43:16] they were all filled with a holy ghost
[43:19] and began to speak
[43:21] in other tongues
[43:23] as a spirit gave them utterance and they
[43:25] were dwelling in jerusalem jews devout
[43:28] men out of every nation under heaven now
[43:31] when this was noised abroad the
[43:33] multitude came together and were
[43:34] confounded
[43:36] because that every man heard them speak
[43:39] in his own language and they were all
[43:42] amazed and marveled saying one to
[43:44] another behold or not all these which
[43:47] speak galileans and how we how here we
[43:50] every man in our own tongue therein we
[43:53] were born
[43:55] now look on down to verse 12 and they
[43:56] were all amazed and were in doubt saying
[43:59] one to another what meanest this others
[44:02] mocked and said these men are full of
[44:05] new wine
[44:06] but peter standing upon the up with the
[44:09] eleven lifted up his voice and said to
[44:11] them ye men of judea
[44:13] and all that dwell in jerusalem be this
[44:15] known unto you and hearken to my words
[44:18] for these are not drunken as you suppose
[44:21] seeing it is but the third hour of the
[44:23] day
[44:24] but this is that which is spoken by the
[44:27] prophet joel i want to go on down to
[44:30] verse i believe 37
[44:33] and we know that he preached a mighty
[44:35] sermon there he said but now when they
[44:37] heard this they were pricked in their
[44:39] hearts and said unto peter and to the
[44:42] rest of the apostles men and brethren
[44:44] what shall we do
[44:45] and peter said unto them repent and be
[44:48] baptized every one of you in the name of
[44:51] jesus christ for the remissions of sins
[44:54] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[44:56] holy ghost
[44:58] for the promise is unto you and your
[45:00] children and to all that are far off
[45:03] even
[45:04] as many as the lord our god shall call
[45:08] amen will let you be seated
[45:10] this evening
[45:12] i'd like to speak to you
[45:15] on the same light
[45:17] the same effect and the same effect
[45:21] two words here affect and effect one
[45:24] starts with a one starts with e and many
[45:27] times we intertwine them and and
[45:29] probably use them and wrong
[45:31] in the wrong places
[45:33] and and at the wrong times because
[45:35] they're so close but they actually have
[45:37] a different meaning and a different wor
[45:40] use the word affect which starts with a
[45:44] is an action word the word e the effect
[45:47] is an object word
[45:49] so the verb affect means to act on or to
[45:53] produce a change
[45:55] in something
[45:56] effect which is most commonly used as a
[45:59] noun meaning result or the consequent or
[46:02] the end result
[46:04] so affect is for action
[46:06] effect is for result
[46:08] and here are some synonyms of effect it
[46:11] means to alter to change to influence to
[46:14] modify
[46:15] to impact so amen as we look this at in
[46:19] the same
[46:20] context as the light we know the or the
[46:23] holy ghost and
[46:25] the word of god the holy ghost it alters
[46:27] it has altered us it has changed us it
[46:30] has influenced us it is modifying us
[46:33] amen is impacting us and every one of us
[46:37] could say amen to that i'm sure tonight
[46:39] because we could look maybe what we were
[46:41] even five years ago two years ago or
[46:44] whatever and we came in contact with the
[46:46] word of god 20 years ago and we can say
[46:49] it has altered us
[46:50] it has changed us it has influenced us
[46:54] it has impacted us
[46:56] but the effect is the word like a is a
[46:59] result or the outcome or the
[47:02] as as as the outcome of the impact so
[47:06] but whether it's the effect or the
[47:08] effect the holy ghost is the same it has
[47:12] the same results it has the same change
[47:15] in power it has the same altering power
[47:18] it says the same modifying power it has
[47:21] the same effect so if one received the
[47:24] holy ghost back 20 years ago and once
[47:27] receives it today it still has the same
[47:29] effect upon their lives or the same
[47:31] effect amen even it was 2 000 years ago
[47:35] on the day of pentecost where they
[47:37] receive the holy ghost we'll find out
[47:38] tonight that that holy ghost when it
[47:40] falls again upon a person it still has
[47:44] the same effect on their lives amen you
[47:47] know and we can we can start looking at
[47:49] this because we know it's the same light
[47:51] and it has the same manifestations you
[47:54] can take the sun out there and it rises
[47:57] and it has an effect upon a plant life
[48:00] and it touches it
[48:02] it affects it it alters it it changes it
[48:06] all kinds of things happen and you can
[48:08] take that same plant and take it out of
[48:10] the presence of the sun and it would
[48:12] begin to die it would begin to wither
[48:13] away it would begin to maybe not grow
[48:15] and not flourish but if you can you can
[48:17] put it under another light you could put
[48:19] it under one of these lights and it
[48:21] would not have the same effect but if
[48:23] you put it out there again under the
[48:25] next day or the next week or whatever
[48:27] and if it still had life in it and that
[48:29] sun began to shine on it it would be the
[48:32] same light that gave birth as it came
[48:34] out of the ground it would begin to have
[48:36] again the same effect upon its life
[48:39] because it's the same light and
[48:41] therefore we know that if the holy ghost
[48:43] fell 2 000 years ago is the same today
[48:46] as it was then it'll also do the same
[48:49] thing today for whoever receives it amen
[48:52] and so i looking at this thought on the
[48:54] light being the same we we can see it
[48:56] very quickly watch it as it goes down to
[48:59] the seven church ages all the way down
[49:02] that it is the same light it is the same
[49:04] spirit of god it is the same attribute
[49:07] of god it is the same god it is the same
[49:09] jesus christ it is the same and it's
[49:12] depicted very clearly in the lamp stands
[49:15] in zechariah
[49:16] 4 and 1 we could read about the angel
[49:18] that talked with him and he said what
[49:20] see us thou and i said i've looked and
[49:22] behold a candlestick all of gold and and
[49:25] the bowl and the top of it and seven
[49:27] lamps thereon and seven pipes which are
[49:30] on the top of it but notice they were
[49:31] all connected to one source they were
[49:34] all connected they didn't have their own
[49:36] source they wasn't piped from somewhere
[49:38] else or some other place they all
[49:40] everyone individually came from the same
[49:42] place and and he said the two olive
[49:45] trees by one on the right side and on
[49:47] the other on the left side and i
[49:49] answered and i spaken the angels saying
[49:51] what are these my lord and the angel
[49:53] answered and said to me knowest thou not
[49:56] what these be and i said no lord and he
[49:58] answered and said this is the word of
[50:00] the lord unto zerubbabel saying not by
[50:03] might nor by by by power but by my
[50:06] spirit saith the lord of hosts so in
[50:09] other words he is speaking right there
[50:11] that my spirit is going to remain the
[50:14] same it's going to have the same power
[50:16] it's going to have the same life-giving
[50:18] power it's going to give the same light
[50:20] it's going to give the same
[50:22] manifestations it's going to do it all
[50:24] the same because it's coming from the
[50:26] same source now brother branham would
[50:27] look at this and he would begin to draw
[50:29] it out and he said here's another lamp
[50:31] of pure gold it's burning brightly
[50:33] because it has plenty of oil which is
[50:35] getting from these two olive trees one
[50:38] standing on one side and other on and
[50:40] the other and he said these two trees
[50:42] represent the old and new testament and
[50:44] of course the oil
[50:47] typifies the holy ghost who along can
[50:50] give the light of god to god's people
[50:53] the angel who spoke to zechariah was as
[50:55] much saying this what you see means the
[50:58] church cannot accomplish anything by its
[51:01] own might or its own power it will only
[51:04] accomplish things by the holy ghost
[51:08] amen therefore we can't take creeds we
[51:11] can't take dogments we can't take ideas
[51:13] of men and we can't put them into this
[51:16] message we can't we got to keep it in
[51:18] it's purity and it's holiness to know
[51:20] that if it if it comes it will produce
[51:23] the same life in its purity amen so we
[51:26] examine this uh lampstand and you'll
[51:28] notice it has a large bowl and in the
[51:31] center it is pulling from a source it is
[51:33] pulling it and the priest just kept
[51:35] pouring oil into this bowl and it would
[51:37] go into each
[51:39] lamp stand into each light now the lamp
[51:42] was lit in a special way first the
[51:44] priest took a fire from the sacred altar
[51:47] which is originally lighted by the fire
[51:49] of god he lit it first of all the lamp
[51:52] that was sitting on top of the bowl he
[51:54] then lit the second and then the third
[51:56] and then the fourth and all the way down
[51:58] to the seventh until all lamps were
[52:00] burning and it said the holy fire from
[52:03] the altar being passed from lamp to lamp
[52:06] to lamp is a wonderful type of the holy
[52:09] spirit throughout the seven church ages
[52:11] the original outpouring of pentecost
[52:14] which is outpouring came directly from
[52:17] jesus on the mercy seat is in doing his
[52:20] church throughout all the seven ages and
[52:22] showing forth perfectly that jesus
[52:25] christ is the same yesterday today and
[52:28] forever and then and the never changing
[52:31] god and his essence in all of his ways
[52:33] and he's showing very very plainly amen
[52:36] as he said i am the vine and ye are the
[52:38] branches that the life or the oil or the
[52:41] spirit is coming from that that vine
[52:44] into those branches and it's producing
[52:47] the same life it's producing the same
[52:49] overcoming power and it ain't our power
[52:52] because he showed us that we can we
[52:53] don't have any power but it's the power
[52:56] of the holy ghost working through the
[52:58] church amen and so we see here as it
[53:01] comes out of that original root from the
[53:02] original seed that has life in it now
[53:05] the vine does not bear fruit the
[53:07] branches do that you said you can take a
[53:10] citrus tree and you can graft it into a
[53:12] grapefruit and a lemon and a lemon lemon
[53:15] to it and a tangelo limb and any other
[53:17] kind of citrus limb and it would grow
[53:19] all those kind of fruits a limb a lemon
[53:22] lime will grow lemons an orange limb
[53:23] will grow oranges but if that original
[53:26] vine ever puts off on its own branch
[53:28] again it'll produce what is in that
[53:31] original vine amen if it's a grapefruit
[53:34] it won't produce oranges it won't
[53:35] produce lemons it won't produce anything
[53:38] but what's in the lime amen what's in
[53:40] the vine and so he says that's the way
[53:42] the church is the vine has been split
[53:45] there's been grafts and there's been
[53:47] this grafted in you got a methodist limb
[53:49] and presbyterian limb and a pentecostal
[53:52] limb and a baptist limb and all kinds of
[53:54] limbs grafted in but if that
[53:57] that vine ever puts off another branch
[54:00] it will have the same life as the
[54:02] original did
[54:04] hallelujah amen they said exactly it'll
[54:07] be the same kind of branch that brought
[54:09] forth at pentecost it will speak in
[54:12] tongues it will prophesy it will have
[54:15] the same power it will have the signs of
[54:17] the resurrected jesus christ in it
[54:20] because it's thriving on the same source
[54:23] as the vine itself
[54:26] hallelujah it wasn't grafted into the
[54:28] vine it was born into the vine
[54:32] hallelujah amen you wasn't grafted here
[54:34] you were born in that's why it's not
[54:37] coming and putting your name on a book
[54:39] and and you sign a paper saying i'll
[54:41] serve him and i'll do this and you sign
[54:43] promise keeper notes and all kind no
[54:45] that's being grafted in but when you're
[54:47] born of the same spirit of god it's no
[54:50] longer you trying anymore because it's
[54:52] not you anymore it's the work of the
[54:54] holy ghost the same light having the
[54:57] same effect and effect upon your life
[55:01] amen
[55:02] he said how thrilling is to think that
[55:03] the seven lamps are drawing life and
[55:07] light from the resources of that main
[55:09] bowl because they had their wicks dipped
[55:11] therein he said each church age
[55:14] messenger is depicted here his life is
[55:16] on fire with the holy
[55:18] ghost how many can see that in the
[55:21] messengers of the seven church ages oh
[55:23] yeah amen i'm setting you up for
[55:25] something his wick has been immersed in
[55:27] christ though that wick he's he through
[55:30] that week he is drawing the very life of
[55:32] christ and by it gives light unto the
[55:35] church and what kind of light he's given
[55:38] is he given the very same light that
[55:40] what the first lamp was lit with
[55:44] amen right on down to the ages to
[55:47] present present time the last day
[55:50] messenger the same life the same light
[55:52] is manifested by the life that was
[55:54] hidden christ and god he said but now
[55:56] here we go not only do we speak thus of
[55:59] the messengers
[56:01] does this speak of the messenger but
[56:03] every true believer is dramatically
[56:06] depicted here
[56:09] amen they are all drawing from the same
[56:12] source they have all been dipped into
[56:14] the same bowl they are dead to
[56:17] themselves and their lives are hidden
[56:18] christ in god they're sealed in by the
[56:21] holy ghost ephesians 4 30 said grieve
[56:23] not the holy spirit of god wherein
[56:25] you're sealed into the day of redemption
[56:28] and no man can pluck them out of his
[56:30] hand their lives cannot be tempered with
[56:33] the visible life of the burning shining
[56:35] is giving light and the manifestations
[56:38] of the holy ghost the inner invisible
[56:40] life is hidden in god and fed by the
[56:43] lord's word satan cannot touch them
[56:48] amen satan cannot touch them not even
[56:51] death can touch them for death has lost
[56:54] his sting and the grave has lost his
[56:57] victory
[57:00] amen you are depicted here very
[57:02] dramatically it's not by your power that
[57:05] you're here tonight
[57:07] you're not here because you had some
[57:09] superhuman power to withstand laodicea
[57:12] and you've been doing a good job no it's
[57:14] not you that doing the work it's christ
[57:16] that's living on the inside of you it's
[57:18] the same light that struck peter on that
[57:21] day that one day he was a coward one day
[57:24] he was
[57:25] he was saying he didn't even know jesus
[57:28] until when he met that life for himself
[57:30] he could stand up and preach the word of
[57:33] god and three thousand souls give their
[57:35] heart to god
[57:37] you have been endued with the same power
[57:40] by the same holy ghost
[57:43] it's the same promise
[57:47] i'm going to go through some things here
[57:48] it's the same manner
[57:53] we know the manner that fell
[57:55] brother would type that to the manna be
[57:57] in the holy ghost the same baptism of
[58:00] the holy ghost
[58:01] he said see it's the same manner that
[58:03] fell on them talking about those in the
[58:06] day of pentecost to give them eternal
[58:08] life like the manna that carried the
[58:10] children of israel through the
[58:11] wilderness is the same baptism of the
[58:14] holy ghost that will carry the church
[58:17] through to glory
[58:22] shouting grounds right there
[58:23] amen you've seen what it did for the
[58:25] children of israel it took them through
[58:27] dry land it took them through enemies it
[58:30] took them through where there's no food
[58:31] no water it held them it kept them and
[58:34] it took them into the promised land
[58:38] you see what it did for peter and paul
[58:40] and all those down to the dark ages they
[58:42] held on
[58:44] it had affected their lives so where
[58:46] they could hold on
[58:52] he said every man that will come to
[58:54] christ and believe that he is a rewarder
[58:57] of those who seek him and give up their
[58:59] sins and throw their arms open to god
[59:02] can have not something that looks like
[59:05] it
[59:06] not an invitation of it but a genuine
[59:10] heart full of the real baptism of the
[59:13] holy ghost like it fell on the day of
[59:15] pentecost make the man it'll make the
[59:18] same signs it'll have the same wonders
[59:20] it'll make you act the same way
[59:25] well what is the effect what is the
[59:28] effect of this it'll make you act like a
[59:31] drunk man
[59:35] liquor's been around for thousands of
[59:37] years and it still has the same effect
[59:41] amen wine has been around for thousands
[59:44] of years and it still has the same
[59:46] effect
[59:49] the holy ghost has been around for
[59:51] thousands of years and it still has the
[59:54] same effect
[59:56] creeds can try to dampen it they can say
[59:58] it ain't so all they want to but if you
[1:00:00] ever get a drink of it if you ever get a
[1:00:03] real dose of the holy ghost it'll have
[1:00:05] the same effect on your life
[1:00:09] it'll make you act like a drunk man
[1:00:12] carry on just like they did on the day
[1:00:14] of pentecost
[1:00:17] oh my
[1:00:18] every believer has a right to receive it
[1:00:22] just like every priest coming into the
[1:00:24] priesthood had a right to get a dose of
[1:00:28] that original manner
[1:00:30] so does everyone that comes into this
[1:00:32] priesthood have a right to the same kind
[1:00:36] of dose as they had on the day of
[1:00:37] pentecost i don't care what a preacher
[1:00:40] says it's what the bible says we have a
[1:00:42] right it's our in enable right to have
[1:00:45] the holy ghost
[1:00:47] to have the power of god
[1:00:49] to have healings and deliverances it is
[1:00:52] our rights
[1:01:00] he says my
[1:01:02] i wish i was twice my size so i can make
[1:01:05] twice as much noise
[1:01:09] amen
[1:01:10] you know we could read about the parable
[1:01:12] of the bridegroom is he would give the
[1:01:14] invitation he would furnish with robes
[1:01:17] which is the type of the holy ghost
[1:01:20] he would invite because he would invite
[1:01:22] poor and he would invite rich
[1:01:24] and to make everyone look the same he
[1:01:26] would give them all the same kind of
[1:01:28] robe
[1:01:30] amen the poor has the same as the rich
[1:01:32] man does so when they put on this robe
[1:01:34] you couldn't tell the difference
[1:01:36] amen and he said when god gives a poor
[1:01:39] man the holy ghost it's the same holy
[1:01:41] ghost he gives to a rich man
[1:01:45] hallelujah they all have it that to be
[1:01:47] the same that's when they come into the
[1:01:50] present god no one can say i dress
[1:01:52] better because it's the same blood it's
[1:01:54] the same grace it's the same holy ghost
[1:01:57] making you act the same way
[1:02:01] if a rich man gets the holy ghost he'll
[1:02:03] act just like the poor man does
[1:02:06] this ain't an uh exclusive gospel to
[1:02:09] where you got to have certain amount of
[1:02:10] this to be here or you have to do a
[1:02:12] certain no god gives to whosoever wants
[1:02:15] and desires it and if they want a taste
[1:02:18] of it he'll give them a taste of it if
[1:02:20] they want a spoonful he'll give it to
[1:02:21] him if they want a cup full they'll give
[1:02:23] it to him if they want a wheelbarrow
[1:02:25] load he'll give it to him
[1:02:29] don't matter what kind of bank account
[1:02:31] you got has nothing that determines
[1:02:33] nothing when it comes to getting the
[1:02:34] holy ghost
[1:02:36] amen
[1:02:38] he is here working with his church in
[1:02:40] the form of the spirit of god that if
[1:02:42] his spirit is with us he'll act exactly
[1:02:46] like he acted when he was here on earth
[1:02:48] and it'll make you act the same way
[1:02:50] because it's not your spirit anymore
[1:02:53] it's his spirits in you
[1:02:57] amen
[1:02:59] it'll probably change some of the ways
[1:03:00] some of you act
[1:03:03] because it won't be your spirit no more
[1:03:07] if a man's born of god he believes every
[1:03:09] word god wrote
[1:03:11] he said and says he just as great today
[1:03:15] as he ever was he never changes he's
[1:03:17] just the same yesterday today and
[1:03:19] forever if he's filled with the holy
[1:03:21] ghost he's got the same holy ghost to
[1:03:22] give on the day of pentecost and makes
[1:03:24] him act the same way and do the same
[1:03:27] things if he's born of the spirit of god
[1:03:30] mark 16 these signs shall follow them
[1:03:33] that belief
[1:03:35] so they'll act the same way they'll go
[1:03:37] out there and they'll fulfill the
[1:03:38] commission of god that he spoke go go
[1:03:41] into all the world and preach the gospel
[1:03:43] and to them that believe baptize
[1:03:45] you'll lay hands upon the sick and they
[1:03:47] shall recover
[1:03:49] amen they're acting the same way just
[1:03:51] like paul
[1:03:52] after peter received the holy ghost he
[1:03:54] went to the gate called beautiful peter
[1:03:56] and john and they saw that man they're
[1:03:58] begging for arms and they say hey silver
[1:04:00] and gold have i none but what i do have
[1:04:02] i can give you some of it
[1:04:05] amen what i do have i just happen to
[1:04:08] just get a good dose of the holy ghost
[1:04:10] the pillar of fire is not no longer
[1:04:12] above me it's living on the inside of me
[1:04:15] it's no longer jesus walking with me
[1:04:17] it's jesus walking in me look on me
[1:04:21] and he fastened his eyes upon them and
[1:04:24] he said in the name of jesus rise up and
[1:04:27] walk and that man stood up and began to
[1:04:30] leap and praise god that'll make you act
[1:04:32] the same way
[1:04:42] he said here stands the anointed
[1:04:44] apostles going up to the up to pentecost
[1:04:46] to receive the holy ghost
[1:04:48] they went straight to pentecost and
[1:04:50] received it
[1:04:51] now the church is
[1:04:52] inaugurated what are we going to do the
[1:04:54] first thing comes out the prescriptions
[1:04:56] got to be made dr simon
[1:04:59] peter has got to write the first
[1:05:01] prescription
[1:05:02] because jesus gave them the keys they
[1:05:04] give you the keys peter whatsoever
[1:05:05] you're buying what whatever prescription
[1:05:08] you write on earth i'll receive it at
[1:05:09] the drugstore write it and i'll accept
[1:05:11] it what do they do
[1:05:13] when all men heard the noise abroad they
[1:05:16] said what mean is this what did peter
[1:05:17] say repent every one of you and be
[1:05:20] baptized in the name of jesus christ for
[1:05:22] the remission of your sin and ye shall
[1:05:25] receive the gift of the holy ghost what
[1:05:27] did they do
[1:05:28] they added father son and holy ghost
[1:05:31] they went to messing with the
[1:05:32] prescription you don't have to go out
[1:05:35] and act like they did
[1:05:39] god don't do it that way no more
[1:05:42] this is a prophet's word you don't have
[1:05:43] to go out and act like they did
[1:05:46] it don't give you joy and power and
[1:05:48] speaking in tongues and all those things
[1:05:50] you don't have to have it
[1:05:55] just make your confession confessions
[1:05:57] shake hands and you'll be okay
[1:06:00] they started messing with the original
[1:06:02] prescription
[1:06:04] there's some more poison dope that said
[1:06:06] that
[1:06:07] let me get this right he said that's
[1:06:09] some more poisoned dope of the devil
[1:06:14] some more poisoned dope of the devil if
[1:06:17] it made them act like that when they
[1:06:19] took the medicine it'll make you act
[1:06:21] like with that if you take the same
[1:06:23] medicine
[1:06:26] amen if you'll take a good dose of the
[1:06:28] holy ghost it'll change your life
[1:06:33] it'll alter you it'll it'll begin to
[1:06:36] transform you it'll begin to change your
[1:06:39] thinking
[1:06:42] what do you think's a bit is going on in
[1:06:44] the world that we're living in right now
[1:06:45] people's thoughts are being altered by a
[1:06:48] spirit
[1:06:50] and it's changing their thinking the
[1:06:51] word they they can't even describe what
[1:06:53] a woman is no more and they they
[1:06:56] we're now legalizing all kinds of
[1:06:58] ungodly things it is something that's
[1:07:00] changing their thinking
[1:07:02] and they're calling it freedom
[1:07:05] amen but it's a spirit that is binding
[1:07:08] them
[1:07:09] it's binding them amen and people want
[1:07:11] to say it this message is binding
[1:07:14] nothing like the world what the world's
[1:07:16] doing
[1:07:17] it's binding them for the burning
[1:07:21] i agree there is this message is binding
[1:07:24] people but it's not binding you for
[1:07:26] burning is binding you for a harvest
[1:07:30] it's binding us together to get out of
[1:07:33] here the world is also being bound
[1:07:36] together but they're being bound
[1:07:37] together not to get out of here but to
[1:07:40] burn
[1:07:45] people
[1:07:46] want to say they're getting away from
[1:07:47] here to be free you're getting away to
[1:07:49] be more bound
[1:07:54] this is more poisoned dope of the devil
[1:07:57] if it made them act like that when they
[1:07:59] took the medicine to make you act the
[1:08:01] same way it's his prescription if god
[1:08:04] poured out the holy ghost from the
[1:08:05] people of pentecost and that was his
[1:08:07] decision then how the church must
[1:08:09] operate that how that the church must
[1:08:11] operate under the power of the holy
[1:08:13] spirit he cannot change that
[1:08:17] he cannot turn it over and say well i'll
[1:08:20] give you a bishop i'll give you this or
[1:08:22] that he's got to remain to that same
[1:08:24] decision therefore if the church on the
[1:08:26] day of pentecost received the baptism of
[1:08:29] the holy ghost the reaction that came
[1:08:32] from that baptism of the holy ghost will
[1:08:34] be the same reaction on every person
[1:08:37] that ever receives the baptism of the
[1:08:39] holy ghost
[1:08:42] mercy jesus
[1:08:47] maybe i need to read that again because
[1:08:49] that was a direct quote
[1:08:52] the reaction that came from the baptism
[1:08:55] of the holy ghost will be the reaction
[1:08:57] on every person that's ever received the
[1:09:00] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:09:10] on the day of pentecost peter was
[1:09:12] speaking
[1:09:13] people who have been had been speaking
[1:09:15] in tongues and making a noise and
[1:09:17] speaking in other languages
[1:09:19] acting like they were drunk men
[1:09:21] they were questioned about these things
[1:09:23] and want to know how they could be saved
[1:09:25] and peter told them to repent and be
[1:09:27] baptized for the remission of their sins
[1:09:29] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:09:31] holy ghost for the promises unto you and
[1:09:33] your children them that are far off the
[1:09:35] promises to whosoever will let him come
[1:09:38] god cannot change that it's the word of
[1:09:40] god it's perfect forever we find out
[1:09:42] that as the ages go on men come in and
[1:09:45] pervert the word of god to make it fit a
[1:09:48] certain tradition
[1:09:51] now they'll come around and say well
[1:09:52] there's no need of receiving the holy
[1:09:54] ghost it's just you come into our
[1:09:56] fellowship you believe what we believe
[1:09:59] you believe the message and you got it
[1:10:08] then meanwhile they're still in
[1:10:09] pornography and ain't nothing altered
[1:10:12] ain't nothing changed
[1:10:14] still living the same life they just got
[1:10:16] a different idea about how things what's
[1:10:18] truth
[1:10:20] he's got some more philosophy to hang on
[1:10:22] to listen we're interested in more than
[1:10:25] philosophy here
[1:10:27] we're interested in the life lebron said
[1:10:30] i fear we're getting too many people to
[1:10:32] an idea or a church or something like
[1:10:34] that but we're not getting them to jesus
[1:10:36] christ we want to get people to the life
[1:10:39] amen amen said see god talking about
[1:10:42] he's talking about solomon this is
[1:10:44] another place i thought was really good
[1:10:45] he said solomon god had given a gift to
[1:10:48] that generation
[1:10:49] it was a gift of discernment and solomon
[1:10:51] after received the gift of discernment
[1:10:53] he was put into action and people came
[1:10:56] from everywhere to believe him he said
[1:10:58] what if they had turned that gift down
[1:11:01] that had been a lost country but they
[1:11:02] believed it and no matter what solomon
[1:11:04] done they stayed with it they believed
[1:11:06] that he was a servant sent from god he
[1:11:09] said what about the christian church
[1:11:10] tonight what if the christian church
[1:11:12] tonight could believe the gift of god
[1:11:14] sent to them the holy ghost
[1:11:19] what if they would receive it what if
[1:11:21] all denominations would rally around the
[1:11:24] holy spirit
[1:11:27] what if all the message would rally
[1:11:29] around the holy spirit
[1:11:31] around the holy spirit
[1:11:34] amen
[1:11:35] as israel rallied around solomon with
[1:11:38] his gift the holy spirit is the gift is
[1:11:41] a gift to the church but the church
[1:11:43] turns it away and shuts it off with
[1:11:45] their doctrines and their theologies and
[1:11:47] their man-made creeds we shut christ
[1:11:50] right out and we don't let the holy
[1:11:52] spirit come in there's no miracles
[1:11:54] there's no shouting there's no speaking
[1:11:56] with tongues there's no praising god we
[1:11:58] have put it all out
[1:12:01] direct quote you want it i can send it
[1:12:03] to you he said if the holy spirit done
[1:12:05] that in the book of acts it'll do the
[1:12:08] same thing today because the book of
[1:12:10] acts is not the acts of the apostles
[1:12:13] it's the acts of the holy spirit in the
[1:12:16] apostles it's the same holy spirit
[1:12:19] that's in the church tonight
[1:12:22] it will act the same way and it will
[1:12:24] give the same results why except the
[1:12:27] substitute
[1:12:30] why have a substitute when the skies are
[1:12:33] full of the real pentecostal power
[1:12:38] listen i don't want a substitute i want
[1:12:40] the real thing
[1:12:43] i want god manifested among his people i
[1:12:46] don't want a substitute of some rosy
[1:12:49] religion that everything's hunky-dory i
[1:12:52] don't care if it skins the hide off of
[1:12:53] me i want god in my life i want god to
[1:12:57] alter my thinking i don't want to be
[1:12:59] conformed to this world but i want to be
[1:13:01] transformed by the power of the living
[1:13:04] god
[1:13:04] [Applause]
[1:13:09] we don't have to have a substitute we
[1:13:12] can have the real
[1:13:24] go on the same effect
[1:13:26] same effect
[1:13:28] but then found out it doesn't matter if
[1:13:30] you're rich or poor
[1:13:32] now let's see this
[1:13:35] he said i was in a meeting our largest
[1:13:37] crowd
[1:13:38] in bombay
[1:13:41] one of my greatest altar calls whatever
[1:13:43] number was in durban south africa
[1:13:46] about 30 30 000
[1:13:49] heathens gave their heart to the lord
[1:13:50] jesus when they seen something
[1:13:52] miraculous take place on the platform
[1:13:56] ten thousand muhammadans followed that
[1:14:00] he said but i noticed something
[1:14:02] you can take the bushmen
[1:14:04] you can take the tribesmen
[1:14:06] you can come in you they come in and
[1:14:08] doesn't even know what's their right
[1:14:10] hand or what their left hands many of
[1:14:12] them don't even hardly wear clothes they
[1:14:14] don't know one word of english
[1:14:16] they don't know any but just their
[1:14:18] tribal language but when they receive
[1:14:20] the holy spirit they act and do the same
[1:14:24] things you do
[1:14:27] when you get the holy spirit it acts the
[1:14:29] same way just exactly the same it shows
[1:14:33] that god is a universal god god is
[1:14:36] omnipresent omniscient omniscient
[1:14:39] infinite and he works the same with all
[1:14:42] people
[1:14:49] so therefore it doesn't matter if you're
[1:14:51] rich poor if you're white black yellow
[1:14:57] if you're purple headed
[1:14:59] you get the holy ghost it'll transform
[1:15:01] you
[1:15:05] amen because it just has the same effect
[1:15:08] it's a certain sound it's it has a
[1:15:11] certain sound
[1:15:13] anything different is uncertain
[1:15:16] anything that says the days of miracles
[1:15:18] are past that's not the holy ghost
[1:15:21] anything anything that says that these
[1:15:24] are there's no more miracles the days of
[1:15:26] miracles are over that's not the holy
[1:15:28] ghost
[1:15:29] anything that says there's something
[1:15:31] wrong with liberty of worship and the
[1:15:34] freedom of worship and you you don't
[1:15:36] need none of that that is not the holy
[1:15:38] ghost
[1:15:39] anything that says you don't need the
[1:15:41] birth the new birth the holy ghost in
[1:15:43] your life that's not the holy ghost
[1:15:45] the holy ghost is trying his best to get
[1:15:48] in every individual he can
[1:15:50] he just wants an open heart that'll say
[1:15:52] god here i am i i'm surrender i'm sorry
[1:15:56] i give it all to you i want you more
[1:15:59] than anything else
[1:16:06] my date might make you act crazy
[1:16:08] to the world
[1:16:10] but a certain sound does that
[1:16:13] when noah heard his certain sound it
[1:16:15] made him act pretty
[1:16:19] uh foolish started
[1:16:21] beating together some nails and a butt
[1:16:22] and some boards together and
[1:16:25] what in the world you doing noah
[1:16:27] woke me up earlier this morning he said
[1:16:29] well i had a visitation
[1:16:31] he said the lord showed me in a dream to
[1:16:33] build a certain boat
[1:16:35] and i've started this morning
[1:16:37] well no it ain't even seven o'clock in
[1:16:39] the morning the sun just barely came up
[1:16:41] he said but it's got to happen
[1:16:44] and he started getting crazier and
[1:16:45] crazier and crazier and crazier
[1:16:51] i heard seen something the other day and
[1:16:53] said people may thank you me thank you
[1:16:55] crazy they thought mo i know it was
[1:16:57] crazy until the rain started coming down
[1:17:00] amen people listen we are going to
[1:17:03] become crazier and crazier and crazier
[1:17:05] to this world
[1:17:08] amen we're not we're we're so far to the
[1:17:11] other side of things to where people
[1:17:13] think we are insane
[1:17:18] but if i mean if you take one of us back
[1:17:20] about 100 years we'd probably fit in
[1:17:23] one of our sisters back 120 years 140
[1:17:26] years whatever it was back amen which
[1:17:28] fit right into what was the normal but
[1:17:30] it's changed so much to where we are
[1:17:33] it's not normal
[1:17:35] what's normal is to be purple-headed or
[1:17:37] or to have tattoos all over your face
[1:17:39] and your hands and your legs everywhere
[1:17:41] have all kinds of things that are
[1:17:43] manifestations and they're not they're
[1:17:45] they think well i'm just being me no
[1:17:46] you're not you're being you're
[1:17:48] manifesting a spirit
[1:17:57] no i thought they thought he was crazy
[1:17:59] but then one day it started raining
[1:18:02] then one day the flood started coming up
[1:18:04] all of a sudden brother noah wasn't as
[1:18:06] crazy as he they thought he was
[1:18:09] amen and you know what's going to happen
[1:18:11] one day the fires are going to start
[1:18:14] burning the bombs are going to start
[1:18:16] falling and they're going to say you
[1:18:17] know what those people that preach that
[1:18:19] message they ain't as crazy as what we
[1:18:21] thought they were
[1:18:24] matter of fact they knew a lot of things
[1:18:25] i wished i would have listened where are
[1:18:27] they at now i don't know we ain't seen
[1:18:29] them in a while they're gone
[1:18:31] [Applause]
[1:18:33] hallelujah amen you might think i'm
[1:18:36] crazy you wait till that morning that
[1:18:38] body changed
[1:18:40] amen when you wait till that starts
[1:18:41] happening the dead and christ started
[1:18:43] arising and appearing as we heard sunday
[1:18:46] the the appearing are you what you wait
[1:18:48] till that happen i won't be as crazy
[1:18:50] then
[1:18:52] but i tell you who will be crazy this
[1:18:54] world will go completely insane to where
[1:18:56] their minds are lost and they see
[1:18:58] locusts with hair and all kinds of
[1:19:00] things are taking place because of the
[1:19:02] torment that's coming upon this world
[1:19:07] hallelujah but there's a people who's
[1:19:09] not being conformed to the world
[1:19:13] they might be thought crazy to the world
[1:19:15] but to them there's a precious light
[1:19:18] it's life-giving life
[1:19:28] he said so it is with the church today
[1:19:30] that accepts christ and been born of the
[1:19:32] holy ghost people think those people are
[1:19:34] crazy some of them say brother branham
[1:19:37] are you still a baptist said no i'm a
[1:19:39] pentecostal
[1:19:41] notice here a what a pentecostal what do
[1:19:43] you mean i've been born of the spirit of
[1:19:46] god and received the holy ghost i'm
[1:19:49] pentecostal
[1:19:51] oh you don't went off the deep end no i
[1:19:54] just heard a certain sound where it came
[1:19:56] from it wrong right out of the pages of
[1:19:58] the bible just as clear as a bell and
[1:20:00] when i received it i know what happened
[1:20:02] i was there i know what took place it
[1:20:04] changed me from death to life it done

[1:20:14] where we're standing we know what we're
[1:20:16] talking about it's a real sound just the
[1:20:19] same kind of sound that came in the
[1:20:21] bible
[1:20:22] like a rushing mighty way makes us act
[1:20:25] the same way it'll make a black man a
[1:20:27] yellow man a brown man all act the same
[1:20:30] because it's the same
[1:20:44] sound the effect
[1:20:48] it might make you
[1:20:50] be crazy to the world
[1:20:54] it might make you act like a drunk man
[1:20:57] you might get lost into
[1:20:59] how many has ever been there
[1:21:03] hey man i know brother lamia's been

[1:21:19] and i i'd actually preached that night

[1:21:23] he was having a prayer line and the
[1:21:24] spirit of god was moving

[1:21:44] he threw with his arm to lay my hands on
[1:21:46] and the boy came became instantly drunk
[1:21:48] for over an hour
[1:21:51] it'll make you act the same
[1:21:54] way well i'll tell you what i don't know
[1:21:57] but
[1:21:58] well just get a drink of it
[1:22:02] find out what it'll do to you
[1:22:07] you know but
[1:22:09] we're we just come to a real i don't
[1:22:11] know if anybody's been around but we we
[1:22:13] come to a real pandemic you know and
[1:22:16] things are
[1:22:20] made people act really strange
[1:22:24] they come out with this vaccine that we
[1:22:26] don't know yet that works
[1:22:28] but let me just let me just read one
[1:22:30] about the smallpox brother branham talks
[1:22:31] about
[1:22:33] when people were dying and things were
[1:22:35] taking place
[1:22:37] many people died with small plots
[1:22:40] because there was no toxin
[1:22:43] but when he said when the epidemic
[1:22:44] breaks out and and out in the city
[1:22:47] quickly you could go down and get a
[1:22:49] smallpox vaccine or a diphtheria shot
[1:22:52] because it had a toxin in it and he said
[1:22:54] i'm thankful for that i'm glad of that
[1:22:56] i'm glad we got it
[1:22:58] he said i thank the lord for that he
[1:23:00] said i pray that he'll give us more and
[1:23:01] more he said i believe if we'll just
[1:23:03] warm up to god there's things here for
[1:23:05] us we was made out of the earth you know
[1:23:07] if we just warm up to him and pray to
[1:23:09] him and quit our wickedness and things
[1:23:11] all these things would be found that's
[1:23:13] right but for you who believe he's got
[1:23:15] the remedy beyond all of that
[1:23:18] amen certainly has it's already made and
[1:23:22] ready for you there was a time when the
[1:23:24] toxin there wasn't any and many people
[1:23:26] died from those diseases but now you can
[1:23:28] be inoculated there was a time when
[1:23:31] god's bomb wasn't perfect it was because
[1:23:34] it was drawn out of the veins of an
[1:23:36] animal
[1:23:38] he said but it's only and it only
[1:23:40] covered sin it didn't divorce it but
[1:23:43] there's no excuse now
[1:23:47] god one day made a toxin and he gave i'm
[1:23:50] going to say something he said he didn't
[1:23:52] try it on a guinea pig he gave it to his
[1:23:55] own son
[1:23:59] amen he said he said he gave it to his
[1:24:01] own son and he inoculated him at jordan
[1:24:04] with the holy ghost when it came down
[1:24:06] upon him every boy every eye watched him
[1:24:09] as he lived amen he lived the life of
[1:24:12] god he looked like god he acted like god
[1:24:14] he lived like god he prayed like god he
[1:24:17] healed like god he raised the dead like
[1:24:20] god he was god and he was inoculated
[1:24:23] from the things of the world and they
[1:24:25] watched him and in his hour of
[1:24:28] death the inoculation held
[1:24:33] there's the effect of it
[1:24:35] the end result if you'll get this holy
[1:24:38] ghost you'll go through a trial it's not
[1:24:40] going to keep you from it but when you
[1:24:42] come on out on the other side
[1:24:44] you'll still have the holy ghost
[1:24:46] amen amen you'll go through hard times
[1:24:49] in your life you might even face death
[1:24:51] but when you come out on the other side
[1:24:54] you'll still have that same
[1:24:56] inoculation that same power of god
[1:25:00] living in you
[1:25:06] so when they they knew he was a prophet
[1:25:09] roman soldier put a rag around his head
[1:25:11] and close his eyes and took a stick hit
[1:25:13] him on the head and said now if you be a
[1:25:15] prophet tell us who hit you and we'll
[1:25:17] believe you the inoculation held
[1:25:22] some of you might ought to check your
[1:25:23] inoculation
[1:25:26] get another dose
[1:25:29] get a real dose
[1:25:32] amen if it ain't holding you
[1:25:34] when you get hit by words and hit by
[1:25:36] somebody doing you wrong and somebody
[1:25:38] wraps you over the head with something
[1:25:40] and it don't hold you need to go back
[1:25:42] and say god i need more of that
[1:25:45] amen
[1:25:46] he didn't mind the devil he said he said
[1:25:48] he didn't mind the devil he said i do
[1:25:50] what the father this is the effect of
[1:25:52] the inoculation amen he didn't mind the
[1:25:55] devil neither do you have to mind the
[1:25:57] devil
[1:25:58] hallelujah i do what the father shows me
[1:26:01] i only do what he says proved that the
[1:26:03] inoculation held when men they reached
[1:26:06] over and they got a big handful of his
[1:26:08] beard and they hocked and spit in his
[1:26:10] faith the inoculation held when his own
[1:26:13] children cried for his blood the
[1:26:15] inoculation hell what did he say father
[1:26:17] forgive them for they know not what they
[1:26:20] do
[1:26:22] oh
[1:26:23] somebody needs some more inoculation
[1:26:27] i don't know i just can't forgive then
[1:26:29] you won't be forgiven
[1:26:33] that's the law
[1:26:34] of god
[1:26:36] actually wrote down in his own prayer
[1:26:39] forgive us as we forgive our debtors
[1:26:44] so therefore the forgiveness you give is
[1:26:46] the forgiveness you receive
[1:26:48] so if you don't want to forgive
[1:26:50] you're not going to be forgiven
[1:26:54] that was free
[1:26:55] but the inoculation
[1:26:57] if you'll take that
[1:26:59] it'll go make you put your arm around
[1:27:01] him
[1:27:02] or her
[1:27:04] whoever it was
[1:27:07] and say i'm sorry
[1:27:09] i don't want nothing standing but
[1:27:11] between me and you and god
[1:27:13] i want to put it under his blood
[1:27:15] that's the inoculation that's what he
[1:27:17] did
[1:27:18] father forgive them
[1:27:20] that's the effect
[1:27:22] when he was riled upon he riled not back
[1:27:25] the inoculation held all hell was
[1:27:27] looking to see if it would hold he was
[1:27:29] making a way for you and i making an
[1:27:31] example
[1:27:32] and when he died at the cross the
[1:27:34] inoculation held
[1:27:39] you know people got really afraid
[1:27:42] really afraid
[1:27:44] and i know people died i'm not trying to
[1:27:46] make light of that my own wife was very
[1:27:48] sick with it but they got terrified
[1:27:53] about a virus
[1:27:55] that had somewhere over a 99 if i
[1:27:57] understand right survival rate and got
[1:28:00] terrified wouldn't come out of their
[1:28:01] house
[1:28:03] you see them even today riding down the
[1:28:05] car by themselves with a mask on
[1:28:08] terrified
[1:28:11] and it's got a 99 whatever if it's i'll
[1:28:14] just go lower 90 percent
[1:28:17] let's just hit that not because i know
[1:28:19] somebody asking whatever 90 percent
[1:28:23] survival rate and they're terrified
[1:28:26] and yet i know a disease is going
[1:28:28] throughout the land
[1:28:30] that's got a hundred percent death rate
[1:28:35] and they don't think nothing about it
[1:28:37] they lined up for shots
[1:28:40] inoculations promises given this is
[1:28:43] going to keep you out of the hospital
[1:28:44] this is going to keep you from dying and
[1:28:45] they lined up for it
[1:28:48] made you have to do it to go travel made
[1:28:50] you have to do it all these kind of
[1:28:51] things and i'm not for it and i'm not
[1:28:53] against it
[1:28:55] whatever you want to do you do all i'm
[1:28:57] saying is they lined up for it and they
[1:28:59] were so proud posting their pictures
[1:29:01] look what i got and yet they were a 100
[1:29:04] death rate
[1:29:06] of sin
[1:29:08] and they've never taken that inoculation
[1:29:16] this world is crazy
[1:29:19] go completely insane over a 90-something
[1:29:21] percent
[1:29:22] survival rate
[1:29:24] and yet a hundred percent death
[1:29:27] and they don't think nothing about it
[1:29:31] but god said i'm going to have an
[1:29:33] inoculation against it
[1:29:37] and this thing
[1:29:38] 10 chance is going to keep you
[1:29:41] 15 chance is going to keep you
[1:29:44] 30 chance it'll help you 50 chance it'll
[1:29:47] keep you
[1:29:49] 80 percent chance it'll keep you 90 95
[1:29:52] this is a hundred percent chance
[1:29:59] a hundred percent chance that if you
[1:30:02] take this inoculation it'll get you out
[1:30:05] of the grave
[1:30:08] hallelujah it's a hundred percent chance
[1:30:11] that if you take this inoculation it'll
[1:30:13] keep you out of the bar room it'll keep
[1:30:15] you off of those dirty websites it'll
[1:30:17] keep you out of hell it'll keep you out
[1:30:20] of the devil's oh grip it'll keep you
[1:30:23] away from hell

[1:30:33] why wouldn't we line up for it why
[1:30:35] wouldn't we say god i want more of it
[1:30:41] i want all i can have
[1:30:43] when he died at the cross the
[1:30:45] inoculation held on eastern morning it
[1:30:47] proved it was there death couldn't hold
[1:30:50] him life and death can't exist in the
[1:30:51] same place and he rose up from the dead
[1:30:54] the inoculation held and he sent it on
[1:30:56] high and amen they wanted and people
[1:30:59] began to want the same thing they begin
[1:31:01] to want this same inoculation amen what
[1:31:04] happens it go on the day of pentecost
[1:31:06] and right there the mighty russian wind
[1:31:08] came down and he gave them the same
[1:31:11] inoculation that he had
[1:31:15] hallelujah and he still got doses if you
[1:31:18] wanted tonight

[1:31:21] the devil that'll take you down to the
[1:31:23] devil's grave a sinner's girl it's in
[1:31:25] the center of hell i'm talking about a
[1:31:27] inoculation that'll keep you from those
[1:31:30] places

[1:31:34] keep you in your time of trouble you may

[1:31:38] other side you'll still be singing the
[1:31:40] praises of almighty god
[1:31:47] these people
[1:31:49] when they become inoculated
[1:31:51] they acted funny
[1:31:56] we found out inoculations have side
[1:31:59] effects
[1:32:02] and people lined up
[1:32:04] for
[1:32:05] inoculations
[1:32:07] that some have even died from
[1:32:11] just saying it is what happened
[1:32:12] someone's died from them brother brother
[1:32:14] david mayer he talked about when he had
[1:32:16] to go get his to be able to travel he
[1:32:18] had his glands swole way up under his
[1:32:20] arm had a big old knot out here all
[1:32:22] kinds of side effects were taking place
[1:32:24] in people's lives and people were
[1:32:26] signing up for it

[1:32:34] it'll make you stagger
[1:32:38] it might make you a little woozy for a
[1:32:39] little bit
[1:32:41] you might not be able to do numbers
[1:32:42] sitting over that chair and your hands
[1:32:44] up in the air and tears streaming down
[1:32:46] your frays face crying out to god like
[1:32:48] brother lemuel

[1:33:32] usually they do when something happens
[1:33:34] substantially that's a profit
[1:33:37] usually they do when something happens
[1:33:39] substantially
[1:33:40] makes them become funny when they take
[1:33:42] this shot
[1:33:43] strange thing of it it was they were all
[1:33:45] drunk looked like or they thought they
[1:33:47] were drunk they were dancing and acting
[1:33:50] like a bunch of drunk people and the
[1:33:52] people that was wasn't inoculation said
[1:33:55] wasn't inoculated said ah these men are
[1:33:57] full of new wine
[1:34:00] he said
[1:34:01] listen my catholic friend the virgin
[1:34:04] mary was in there and if the virgin mary
[1:34:06] the mother of our lord jesus christ had
[1:34:08] to go up to pentecost and get so full of
[1:34:10] the inoculation of god's spirit till she
[1:34:12] acted like a drunk woman how are you
[1:34:14] going to get it anything with any way
[1:34:17] less than that
[1:34:20] just think that over how are you going
[1:34:22] to make it no matter what the church you
[1:34:23] belong to she belonged to a holy church
[1:34:26] too but she had to get inoculated that
[1:34:28] the only thing that would raise her up
[1:34:30] had to come that life had to come in she
[1:34:32] had to become inoculated and when they
[1:34:34] got this inoculation they went into the
[1:34:36] streets and began to act real strange
[1:34:38] dancing screaming running around people
[1:34:41] no doubt laughed and said they look like
[1:34:42] they're having a fit but they were
[1:34:45] inoculated
[1:34:48] hallelujah he said i remember one time
[1:34:50] he was out on the range and he was there
[1:34:52] in colorado with the hereford
[1:34:54] organization there and it was brandon
[1:34:56] some calves and they brought these
[1:34:58] yearlings up and they'd heat this old
[1:34:59] brand and iron up surreal hot and they'd
[1:35:01] put it on the side that calf that calf
[1:35:04] would let loose and have a fit and you'd
[1:35:06] let him go after he got burned he would
[1:35:07] had a running fit he'd begin to scream
[1:35:10] and holler and carry on he said but
[1:35:12] brother he was yours
[1:35:15] he was branded it hurt him a little bit
[1:35:17] but he knowed where he belonged after
[1:35:19] that he said this holy ghost might hurt
[1:35:22] your pride it might burn a little your
[1:35:24] egg
[1:35:25] ecclesiastical fur off but you know
[1:35:28] where you belong to from then on
[1:35:31] because you've been branded by the holy
[1:35:33] ghost there's something that has
[1:35:35] happened to you
[1:35:37] they began to speak with other tongues
[1:35:38] these men said now what menace all this
[1:35:41] with him speak in her own tongues
[1:35:45] and after a little while this little boy
[1:35:47] little man got up and he stood on this
[1:35:48] soapbox and he began to preach
[1:35:51] and he began to speak of this of the
[1:35:53] prophet joel and he said this is that
[1:36:01] and he preached to him they said well
[1:36:02] where can we get some of this
[1:36:03] inoculation
[1:36:05] where can we get it this serum had been
[1:36:07] just poured out
[1:36:09] and dr simon peter said you can have it
[1:36:12] too
[1:36:13] i'll write the prescription repent
[1:36:17] every one of you and be baptized in the
[1:36:19] name of jesus christ for the remission
[1:36:22] of your sins and you shall be inoculated
[1:36:25] and besides that i'm going to make this
[1:36:27] a lifelong prescription
[1:36:32] it'll hold all your life
[1:36:36] hallelujah amen but it's a prescription
[1:36:39] that cannot be full with nobody else can
[1:36:42] try to write it any other way
[1:36:46] it has to be wrote the same way if a
[1:36:48] doctor goes and writes a prescription a
[1:36:50] real good doctor he knows how much
[1:36:52] certain things need to be there but
[1:36:53] another one comes in and upsets it some
[1:36:55] quack druggest starts adding this or
[1:36:58] taking this away it might kill the
[1:37:00] patient and that's exactly what's
[1:37:02] happened quack preachers have gotten a
[1:37:04] pulpit and they've taken this out and
[1:37:06] they've added this to it and it's messed
[1:37:07] it all up go back to what he said
[1:37:11] repent and be baptized and ye shall
[1:37:14] receive the holy ghost
[1:37:16] it's the same light
[1:37:18] and it'll have the same effect
[1:37:21] and it'll have the same result
[1:37:26] it's god's prescription
[1:37:28] there is a bomb in gilead
[1:37:30] there is a great physician
[1:37:33] don't fool with the prescription
[1:37:37] shake somebody's hand and take them to
[1:37:39] philip no that don't that don't take no
[1:37:41] repentance
[1:37:43] sprinkle somebody with a little shaker
[1:37:44] full of salt nope it they don't take the
[1:37:46] place of water baptism quit fooling with
[1:37:49] the prescription
[1:37:50] the physician is here
[1:37:53] he said the doctors hear the holy spirit
[1:37:55] he's the one who wrote it
[1:37:57] and they used it
[1:37:58] and it held
[1:38:00] and it held and it held
[1:38:03] and it'll still hold every time
[1:38:07] it's the same light
[1:38:09] it's the same life
[1:38:11] it's the same jesus
[1:38:13] it's the same yesterday today and
[1:38:14] forever therefore it has to have the
[1:38:18] same effects
[1:38:20] it has to have the same effects
[1:38:23] it has to be the same or it ain't the
[1:38:26] same light
[1:38:29] might be an artificial light it might
[1:38:31] look like light
[1:38:32] might light up a real dark place for a
[1:38:34] while
[1:38:35] but it'll go out
[1:38:39] but that sun
[1:38:41] it'll shine on
[1:38:42] and on and the s-o-n it'll shine on and
[1:38:47] on and when men's creeds die off that
[1:38:49] sun will still be shining
[1:38:51] when men's ideas die away many times it
[1:38:53] does with their when they die but that
[1:38:56] sun will still be shining because he
[1:38:58] rose again
[1:39:00] hallelujah he said what we need is men
[1:39:02] and women
[1:39:03] today they can shut the mouth of the
[1:39:05] world by the signs of the holy ghost
[1:39:07] we need to turn it upside down and
[1:39:09] shaken out a lot of the world and things
[1:39:11] out of the church that come in these
[1:39:12] last days
[1:39:14] he says there's got a lot of a lot of
[1:39:16] compromising going on compromising with
[1:39:18] scriptures he said the blood
[1:39:20] doesn't run in a genu that blood doesn't
[1:39:23] run in a genuine holy ghost man or woman
[1:39:26] of god all devils in hell can't upset
[1:39:28] him on that word he'll stand on it and
[1:39:30] regardless of what comes nothing present
[1:39:33] future anything the real genuine birth
[1:39:37] of the holy spirit comes in that man
[1:39:39] he'll stand there
[1:39:41] it'll hold
[1:39:43] it'll hold
[1:39:45] amen some of you the devil's been after
[1:39:47] you this way you need to look at that
[1:39:49] devil and say hey i'm still here
[1:39:51] and it's not by my mind it is not by my
[1:39:54] power it's by his spirit saith the lord
[1:39:59] it'll hold
[1:40:05] it has the same
[1:40:09] it has the same effects
[1:40:12] we heard already
[1:40:13] god doesn't have grandchildren he just
[1:40:15] has sons and daughters
[1:40:18] so you've got to do the same thing they
[1:40:20] did on the day of pentecost
[1:40:22] you've got to have the same experience
[1:40:25] you've got to have the same thing they
[1:40:26] had god
[1:40:28] don't ever change his program he never
[1:40:32] changes his ways he just the same does
[1:40:35] the same all the time the way he lays it
[1:40:37] down at the beginning it'll tow each
[1:40:40] time it's got to be the same and if you
[1:40:42] do the same thing the same results will
[1:40:45] come
[1:40:47] the same results will come
[1:40:53] the toxin will hold
[1:40:55] it'll keep you
[1:40:56] from death
[1:40:58] there's a plague of death going
[1:40:59] throughout the land
[1:41:02] you better get the toxin against it
[1:41:05] there's a plague of death and people are
[1:41:06] dying
[1:41:08] falling off
[1:41:12] falling into a bottomless pit
[1:41:14] because they refused the toxin
[1:41:17] the inoculation
[1:41:19] i wouldn't refuse it tonight this is one
[1:41:21] you don't want to refuse
[1:41:24] you can refuse to covet shot if you want
[1:41:26] you can refuse to give your kids vaccine
[1:41:28] whatever but don't refuse this
[1:41:35] he said well
[1:41:38] what if it makes me act like that so be
[1:41:40] it
[1:41:41] as long as i got it
[1:41:44] i don't care how it makes me act
[1:41:46] i just want it

[1:41:52] in both arms
[1:41:54] i want him more than anything
[1:41:57] and i want it to affect my life and have
[1:42:00] the effect
[1:42:02] that it had for them
[1:42:05] the effect
[1:42:06] is if you go by the grave it'll take you
[1:42:08] out of there
[1:42:12] that's the end result or if you don't go
[1:42:15] by the grave
[1:42:16] it'll change your body
[1:42:19] to be like his glorious body
[1:42:21] say lord i want to i want to witness
[1:42:23] that effect in my life
[1:42:25] let's buy our heads
[1:42:26] you stand to your feet
[1:42:28] musicians come
[1:42:38] it's the same
[1:42:46] doctor finds a remedy for disease he
[1:42:48] writes out a prescription
[1:42:50] some quack drug is gets a hold of it
[1:42:52] adds little this a little that
[1:42:54] he'll either kill the patient or
[1:42:56] or hurt him somehow
[1:42:59] the prescription doesn't even have
[1:43:01] enough medicine in it to do it any good
[1:43:03] anymore
[1:43:05] it's so weak
[1:43:07] it won't help the patient
[1:43:09] see that's what's the matter with a lot
[1:43:10] of these seminary druggists today
[1:43:12] they've taken the prescription out add a
[1:43:14] little bit of this
[1:43:16] and you know you got now is a bunch of
[1:43:18] dying morgues
[1:43:21] the prescription still remains the same
[1:43:26] when the samaritans received it they got
[1:43:28] inoculated the same thing when the
[1:43:30] gentiles receive it the same thing paul
[1:43:33] met a bunch in acts 19 the same thing
[1:43:40] what's the matter today
[1:43:42] there's plenty of bomb in gilead
[1:43:45] and we've got plenty of physicians
[1:43:48] but the people are afraid of the
[1:43:49] prescription
[1:43:53] he says is there no bomb in gilead
[1:43:56] is there no power of the holy spirit
[1:44:00] there is
[1:44:02] the inoculation works on all
[1:44:05] it did on all jews it did on all samaria
[1:44:08] samaritans it did on all gentiles it
[1:44:11] does on everybody
