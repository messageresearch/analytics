[30:32] God hallelujah let's talk to
[30:36] him Heavenly Father Lord that's the
[30:38] desire of our hearts tonight not that I
[30:41] would speak Lord God and not even that
[30:44] your people would hear as it were but
[30:46] that Lord you would speak and that you
[30:48] would hear through your people Lord open
[30:50] our mouth Lord open our ears Lord we ask
[30:53] you to take complete control Lord that
[30:55] as we look down Through the Ages Lord
[30:57] Lord Lord we can see the great truth
[30:59] that you've revealed in this day Lord
[31:01] and may we not just leave these things
[31:03] in the past or in history but may we
[31:04] recognize where they're applicable in
[31:06] our own lives father Lord for we know
[31:09] that the spirits that have attacked down
[31:10] Through the Ages still attack Lord but
[31:13] the same power that you gave to the men
[31:15] and women down through the ages to
[31:16] overcome with still overcomes in this
[31:19] day Lord we just thank you Lord God for
[31:21] that we ask you that you'll speak now
[31:22] that you'll take control of this service
[31:24] and that you'll have your way Lord we
[31:26] just committed all to to you now in the
[31:28] name of Jesus we pray amen and
[31:32] amen hallelujah isn't it good to be in
[31:36] the house of God Amen well um if you're
[31:40] surprised to see me up here tonight
[31:41] you're not near as surprised as I am I
[31:45] uh no brother Timothy woke up sick this
[31:48] morning and so um brother Tim had asked
[31:52] me if I would stand in tonight and and
[31:55] and have the opportunity Unity to share
[31:58] with you the church what we have been
[32:00] sharing with
[32:03] uh with the young people as we've
[32:05] studied the church ages and so um we're
[32:08] going to read one one scripture here in
[32:11] in the Book of Revelation if you'll turn
[32:12] with me to Revelation 2 and and and and
[32:15] we'll read um verse 12 and we'll just
[32:19] remain standing as as we read this one
[32:21] verse then I'll let you have your seat
[32:22] and we'll come back to the scriptures
[32:24] later uh Revelation 2 and verse 12 it
[32:28] says and to the angel of the church in
[32:31] pergamus write these things saith he
[32:36] which hath the sharp sword with two
[32:39] edges amen I pray that the Lord will add
[32:42] His blessings to the word as you have
[32:43] your seats
[32:45] tonight amen so it'll be a little
[32:47] different tonight I I'm I'm not
[32:50] necessarily going to do anything
[32:51] different I'm just going to approach
[32:53] this the same way I do our youth
[32:54] services and just trust that the Lord
[32:56] will have his his way and that that that
[32:58] he'll move the way he wants to move and
[33:00] and that we can just get ourselves out
[33:02] of the way tonight amen amen so we've
[33:05] been studying with with the youth the
[33:06] the the the church age book and and I
[33:10] would like to say that if if you haven't
[33:13] read it recently I would recommend that
[33:15] you do I would recommend that you get in
[33:18] it it's not one of those things that you
[33:19] read once and say well I've read it or
[33:22] you know I know what's in there but but
[33:24] just everything we believe you can find
[33:26] in the church age book uh after the
[33:28] Bible I think it's the most important
[33:30] book that there is and and I think that
[33:32] we should go through it you know time
[33:34] and and time again and I'd like to you
[33:37] know and when you read it don't just
[33:39] read it but read it with with a mind of
[33:41] Revelation and Lord open your word to me
[33:43] and and and and actually go through it
[33:45] and digest it but with the youth we have
[33:48] come down through and studied the
[33:50] revelation of Jesus Christ we've studied
[33:52] the patmas vision the Ephesian age and
[33:56] we've also already studied the sman
[33:59] age and we find that it's important
[34:02] because brother Bram says for out of the
[34:04] Ages come the seals and out of the seals
[34:07] come the trumpets and out of the
[34:09] trumpets come the vows like the first
[34:12] burst of a Roman Candle the church Ages
[34:14] come forth with a mighty initial
[34:17] illumination without which there could
[34:19] be no further light but once the
[34:22] Brilliance of the seven Church ages is
[34:24] given by divine revelation light upon
[34:28] light follows until the whole of the
[34:31] Revelation open wide before our
[34:33] wondering eyes you read that and you can
[34:36] see the importance of understanding and
[34:38] Revelation and digging into this and and
[34:41] it's important once again to to stress
[34:43] the importance of revelation we can read
[34:47] it we we can memorize it we can learn
[34:50] things but we want it to be more than
[34:52] that tonight we want it to be God
[34:54] revealing himself to us re revealing
[34:57] himself to our soul to where there's a
[34:59] true understanding not just a head
[35:01] knowledge not just something that that
[35:04] we know because we've memorized it but
[35:05] we know because we've met the author we
[35:08] know because he's opened it up to us
[35:10] amen we want God to reveal himself to us
[35:14] and brother brand says the importance of
[35:17] Revelation by the spirit to a True
[35:20] Believer can never be
[35:23] overemphasized so no matter how much we
[35:25] talk about it no matter how much we
[35:27] preach about it no matter how much we
[35:29] put it out there we cannot overemphasize
[35:31] it he says it can never be
[35:33] overemphasized Revelation means more to
[35:36] you than perhaps you realize now I'm not
[35:39] talking about this book of Revelation he
[35:42] says I'm talking about revelation God
[35:44] revealing himself to you personally amen
[35:48] once God's revealed something to you
[35:50] there's nobody no man no Spirit no devil
[35:53] no nothing that can take it out of your
[35:54] heart if you know this message by head
[35:57] knowledge and you have an argument then
[35:58] somebody might can just come and out
[36:00] argue but once you have an experience
[36:03] and a revelation of who God is you're
[36:05] not the at the mercy of an argument
[36:07] you're not the at the mercy of somebody
[36:09] with the better head knowledge than you
[36:11] because it anchors down in your soul and
[36:13] it's there forever it is an eternal
[36:16] Revelation amen so we have we have
[36:19] studied with the young people the the
[36:21] Supreme deity of Jesus Christ the errors
[36:25] of the Trinity Doctrine because we know
[36:28] and the word proves and history proves
[36:30] that they didn't believe in three Gods
[36:32] at the beginning they didn't believe in
[36:34] three gods in the book of Acts and it
[36:36] wasn't until the nying Council of 325 ad
[36:40] that that the Roman way of polytheistic
[36:43] worship became instituted into the
[36:45] church and we've studied proper baptism
[36:48] in the name of Jesus Christ according to
[36:50] the scriptures we've studied the
[36:52] original sin in the garden and thus
[36:54] because of the original sin the the two
[36:56] separate vines that we find winding down
[36:58] through the church ages and all through
[37:01] time and we know that there's one True
[37:03] Vine and one false Vine and how that
[37:06] false Vine is always trying to take the
[37:08] life away and choke out the True Vine
[37:11] she's always trying to rob that life and
[37:13] and we we've studied the persecution of
[37:15] the church and the tribulations that the
[37:18] Saints down Through the Ages have
[37:19] endured for the cause of Christ and many
[37:22] other things we've covered like the
[37:23] sound of many Waters the Seven Stars in
[37:26] his right hand the Sevenfold Glory of
[37:28] his person all these things and now
[37:30] we're coming to a new age tonight we've
[37:34] studied The Messengers in each age but
[37:36] now we're at the start of another age
[37:37] the pergami and age and so that's where
[37:40] we find
[37:41] ourselves tonight the it says and I'm
[37:44] going to read again and to the angel in
[37:47] pergamus write these things saith he
[37:50] which hath the sharp sword with two
[37:53] edges I Know Thy works and where thou
[37:56] dwellest even where Satan's seat is and
[37:59] thou holdest fast my name and Hast not
[38:02] denied my faith even in those days
[38:05] wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr
[38:08] who was slain among you where Satan
[38:10] dwelleth but I have a few things against
[38:13] thee because thou Hast there them that
[38:16] hold the doctrine of balum who taught
[38:18] baac to cast a stumbling B before the
[38:21] children of Israel to eat things
[38:23] sacrificed un idols and to commit
[38:25] fornication
[38:27] says so hast thou also them that hold
[38:29] the doctrine of the
[38:31] nicians which thing I hate repent or
[38:36] else I will come unto thee quickly and
[38:37] will fight against them with the sword
[38:39] of my mouth he that hath an ear let him
[38:41] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[38:43] churches to him that overcometh will I
[38:45] give to eat of the Hidden mana and will
[38:48] give him a white stone and in the stone
[38:50] a new name written which no man knoweth
[38:53] saveth he that receiveth it amen so
[38:57] tonight this this is the message to to
[38:59] the church there at pergamus we'll
[39:01] probably only get to to look at at verse
[39:03] 12 and verse 13 but we want to look for
[39:06] a minute a lot of this will be
[39:07] informational because we're going just
[39:09] through the church age book as as
[39:10] brother Bram would do
[39:12] it pergamus lasted from 3:12 to 606 ad
[39:18] you can see it here on the map in the
[39:19] northern part there of Asia Minor you
[39:21] can see the seven churches we started at
[39:23] Ephesus went up to Smyrna and now we're
[39:26] up
[39:27] at at pergamus pergamon was the actual
[39:29] the ancient name um but as down through
[39:32] time it became known as
[39:34] pergamus what you see here is just some
[39:37] of the the ruins that are still left
[39:39] behind from that
[39:41] time that still stand to this day there
[39:44] at the city of
[39:46] pergamus pergamus was located on three
[39:49] different Rivers one of these Rivers had
[39:52] access down to the Sea and it wasn't a
[39:54] small place there was over 2,000 th
[39:57] 200,000 residents that lived in pergamus
[40:00] at its apex when it was at its most
[40:02] powerful and and and brother Brown it
[40:05] was a major intellectual and Cultural
[40:06] Center brother Bram says yes it was a a
[40:09] a a a city of great sin given over to
[40:12] lentu rights of the worship of of of
[40:16] aspius whom they worshiped in the form
[40:18] of a living serpent which was housed and
[40:21] fed in the temple he goes on to say in
[40:25] this beautiful city of irrigated Groves
[40:28] public walks and Parks lived a small
[40:32] group of dedicated Believers I like to
[40:36] believe that that would be our
[40:37] description even today maybe we live in
[40:39] a world full of sin a world full of evil
[40:41] and you know in this place they were
[40:42] actually worshiping a living serpent we
[40:45] live in a time where people worship the
[40:47] devil they may call on the name of Jesus
[40:49] but they they they worship the devil
[40:51] their lives prove that their lives
[40:53] manifest that we're surrounded by evil
[40:56] but down there in Le oosa there is a
[40:58] small group of dedicated Believers there
[41:01] are people that have received the truth
[41:03] of the day and they're holding on to it
[41:05] no matter what comes no matter who tries
[41:07] to pull away no matter who tries to
[41:09] strip us of of of the god-given rights
[41:12] that we have in this day we're going to
[41:14] stand firm and fight for them and we're
[41:16] not backing off and one day there'll be
[41:18] written of us that there was a small
[41:20] group of dedicated Believers that stood
[41:23] firm in the face of evil that stood firm
[41:25] in the the face of sin
[41:29] Amen brother Brown makes it clear that
[41:31] the key to the whole church AE study to
[41:35] everything he said it is the
[41:38] Revelation that God never
[41:41] changes and that his ways are as
[41:44] unchangeable as he
[41:47] is that's why the the very theme of this
[41:49] message was Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the
[41:53] same yesterday today and forever and
[41:57] brother brandham goes and some of these
[41:58] things are very very impertinent to our
[42:00] day as as there's people saying that you
[42:02] know maybe you shouldn't have so much
[42:04] emotion in the church and and we don't
[42:06] need certain things and certain things
[42:08] are are have been put on the shelf and
[42:09] you don't get the new birth the way they
[42:11] used to and and then you know that maybe
[42:13] there's no true revival going on things
[42:15] like that but brother brandham says
[42:17] speaking of how God never changes he
[42:19] says that is how it is done the true
[42:23] church how many believe we're the true
[42:25] church
[42:27] will always try to be like the original
[42:30] at
[42:31] Pentecost he says the true church of
[42:34] today will try to approximate that early
[42:38] first one and The Messengers to the
[42:41] churches having the same spirit of God
[42:43] in them will try to approximate the
[42:46] Apostle Paul so he's using scriptural
[42:50] pattern here and he says using history
[42:53] as our source he says we can find what
[42:56] men in each age were the closest to the
[43:01] original pattern and we know that the
[43:03] Apostle Paul was the original messenger
[43:06] so what they so what he would do is he
[43:08] would examine the ministry of those men
[43:11] that God used to restore truth in each
[43:14] age not that there was just one there
[43:17] may have been many that God used to
[43:20] restore truth in each in each age but
[43:22] brother Brandon would go and he would
[43:23] examine them and he would use this
[43:25] scriptural
[43:26] pattern he says then out of those there
[43:29] would be one of every age who would
[43:33] stand out the clearest as the closest in
[43:37] word pattern and power that one would be
[43:42] the messenger now as he looked he they
[43:45] wouldn't be carbon copies it wouldn't be
[43:47] in somebody trying to stand a certain
[43:49] way talk a certain way that's not what
[43:51] he's talking about they wouldn't be
[43:52] carbon copies but all of all the gifts
[43:56] and of all the Ministries in each age
[43:59] the one that is the most like Paul
[44:02] meaning that preached the word the way
[44:04] he preached it that stood for the truth
[44:06] that Paul stood for the one who who who
[44:08] who would would contend for the faith as
[44:10] it was once delivered that one he said
[44:14] would be the messenger to each age and
[44:16] he says as like begets like now listen
[44:19] again the true church will always be the
[44:23] one that tries to follow in the steps of
[44:25] her found ERS at
[44:27] Pentecost how different is that from
[44:29] those trying their best to distance
[44:31] themselves from
[44:33] Pentecost not only are we not trying to
[44:36] be just exactly like it but we're
[44:38] literally finding people pushing away
[44:41] saying we don't need we don't need and
[44:43] brother brandham saying the true church
[44:45] is going to literally try to copy
[44:48] it they're going to look at it and say
[44:50] what was at Pentecost is mind what the
[44:53] new birth that they had at Pentecost is
[44:55] mind the Salvation that their kids could
[44:57] get in the book of Acts is for me the
[44:59] healings they had is for me where they
[45:01] spoke in tongues we can too where there
[45:04] was gifts we can have those gifts too
[45:06] he's saying that what the church had at
[45:08] Pentecost is the inalienable right of
[45:11] each and every one of you and he says
[45:14] the true church is going to try to get a
[45:16] hold of it they're going to fight for it
[45:19] he says and her Messengers will follow
[45:21] the Apostle Paul the first Messenger to
[45:23] the first age he says it is that
[45:28] simple and that
[45:31] wonderful why have we complicated it so
[45:34] much it's that simple it's really not
[45:39] even it's one of those things there's
[45:41] things in the scripture that I can
[45:42] understand sometimes maybe you don't see
[45:44] it the way I see it and I don't see it
[45:45] but brother Brown says this isn't
[45:48] debatable this is how it is it's that
[45:54] simple so using this scriptural
[45:57] pattern he says useing our god-given
[46:00] rule for choosing the messenger to each
[46:02] age that is we choose the one whose
[46:05] Ministry most closely approximates that
[46:07] of the first messenger Paul we
[46:10] unhesitatingly declare the pergami and
[46:13] Messenger to be
[46:16] Martin I read that and I thought isn't
[46:18] that
[46:19] awesome just the way brother brandham
[46:21] worded that right there
[46:23] unhesitatingly declare you talk about
[46:26] seeing things from a higher plane you
[46:29] talk about uh uh being being able to see
[46:31] things in this day that no other age has
[46:33] been able to
[46:35] see we can look at things in the past
[46:37] and study things from past ages that
[46:39] others can only prob at and well maybe
[46:41] it was like this and maybe this and you
[46:43] know and who knows and yet we look at it
[46:45] clearly we don't wonder if maybe it was
[46:47] Martin we can unhesitatingly declare
[46:51] today that the messenger of this age was
[46:54] Martin there's no doubt out there's no
[46:56] wonder but it's been declared to us in
[46:58] this day unhesitating listen in a world
[47:01] of darkness in a world where there is no
[47:03] truth in a world where people are
[47:05] wandering around aimlessly we can stand
[47:06] today unhesitatingly and say God sent a
[47:09] message in this day God has restored
[47:11] truth in this day God has turned our
[47:13] hearts back in this day I don't have to
[47:15] be ashamed that God sent a prophet I
[47:18] don't got that doesn't embarrassed me
[47:19] none because I can take everything he
[47:21] said right back to the word
[47:24] unhesitatingly and so it's been
[47:26] Vindicated Time After Time After Time we
[47:30] can stand on this message tonight
[47:37] unhesitatingly Martin was born in
[47:39] Hungary in
[47:41] 3:15 brother Brown says however his life
[47:44] work was in France where he labored in
[47:47] and around tours as a bishop he died in
[47:51] 399 he's the uncle of St Patrick of ir
[47:56] Ireland and he was a professional
[47:59] Soldier brother brandham goes on to talk
[48:02] about Martin and his conversion and and
[48:05] and some of the things that that that
[48:06] pointed to him that let him know that he
[48:09] was the
[48:10] messenger for the age he says Martin was
[48:13] converted to Christ while he was
[48:14] following a career as a professional
[48:17] Soldier and his conversion came from a
[48:20] very Supernatural event that he
[48:23] experienced while he was a soldier as as
[48:25] he was on patrol one night and it was
[48:27] freezing cold and snow and and things of
[48:31] that
[48:32] nature there was a beggar there on the
[48:35] side of the road that was freezing to
[48:37] death and no one else had paid any
[48:39] attention to him they just left it there
[48:42] Along by the side didn't give no heed to
[48:46] him and just let him lay there until
[48:48] Martin comes along and Martin sees him
[48:51] there and in the bitter cold and and he
[48:54] doesn't have ant extra coat or an extra
[48:57] cloak that he can give him so he takes
[48:58] off the one that he's wearing and he
[49:01] cuts it in half and then he takes and
[49:03] wraps the beggar there in the in one
[49:06] half of it that he can be shielded from
[49:08] the cold and and warm and and brother
[49:10] Bram says he attended him the best he
[49:12] could and went on his way he says that
[49:16] night the Lord Jesus appeared unto him
[49:18] in a vision there he stood like a beggar
[49:21] wrapped in the half of Martin's garment
[49:24] he spoke to him and said Martin though
[49:26] he is only a cuman has clothed Me With
[49:30] His Garment he says from that moment on
[49:33] he sought to serve God with all his
[49:35] heart and his life became a series of
[49:38] Supernatural Miracles that manifested
[49:41] the power of God you know and I could
[49:44] only I just thought about that Within
[49:46] Myself and I and I know this is just
[49:48] just me in my own mind but I thought
[49:50] today you we there are things that the
[49:53] church world is just neglecting and
[49:55] they're just just leaving Jesus
[49:56] neglected there with dirty feet and
[49:58] they're not paying him any attention but
[50:00] there's somebody coming along and
[50:01] recognizing that that part of the word
[50:03] supposed to be picked up and that part
[50:05] of the word is supposed to be picked up
[50:06] and it's supposed to be taken care of
[50:08] and cherished and brought in from from
[50:10] the from the world where it's been
[50:12] neglected and left out there and there's
[50:14] a people today that's taking the very
[50:16] word Jesus and putting it back in a
[50:18] place that it deserves in a place of
[50:20] reverence and then picking it up and
[50:22] saying the word matters the truth
[50:24] matters others may have left it
[50:26] neglected by the wayside but to us we're
[50:28] not going to leave it there but we're
[50:30] going to pick it up and we're not just
[50:31] going to live by bread alone but by
[50:33] every word that proceedeth out of the
[50:35] mouth of God yes says from that moment
[50:39] on his life became a series of
[50:43] Supernatural Miracles that manifested
[50:46] the power of God so apparently that the
[50:49] the the the works that happened in the
[50:51] book of Acts were still happening here
[50:53] in the pergan church age
[50:57] those that followed the me the true
[50:59] message in the pergami ande were
[51:00] experiencing and witnessing the
[51:04] supernatural it says after having left
[51:07] the Army brother Brown says and having
[51:08] become a leader in the church he took a
[51:11] militant stand against
[51:13] idolatry he cut down the Pagan Groves
[51:16] tore down the images of of their idols
[51:19] and he destroyed their altars says he
[51:22] had no fear I I like a man that has no
[51:25] fear that isn't afraid to stand up for
[51:28] what he believes in says he had no fear
[51:30] of the enemy regardless of their
[51:32] standing or regardless of their position
[51:35] he wasn't swayed by politics he wasn't
[51:38] swayed by who paid the most highs and
[51:40] and this that and the other he didn't
[51:41] care about any of that stuff so he he
[51:44] withstood Bishops he withstood Emperors
[51:46] he withstood everyone as long as they
[51:48] were standing against the word of
[51:51] God says one ruler actually refused to
[51:53] open the gates and let him in
[51:56] because he had this this Emperor was
[51:58] persecuting people and and and so
[52:00] Martin's there to speak with him and so
[52:02] he prayed and the gates open
[52:04] supernaturally so Martin goes in and the
[52:07] emperor won't even look at him just hay
[52:09] and won't even look at him refuses to
[52:11] listen to him refuses to speak to him so
[52:13] right there in his presence Martin falls
[52:15] on his face and goes to prayer again and
[52:18] then right there in the midst of
[52:19] witnesses a a fire burst forth out of
[52:22] the throne that the emperor is sitting
[52:24] on and he has to come running down off
[52:27] of the throne right there and brother
[52:29] brandham just says he says God will
[52:31] always humble the hoty he'll always
[52:34] humble the hoty but right there Martin
[52:36] was a man who operated and believed in
[52:39] the
[52:41] Supernatural says historians acknowledge
[52:43] that on least three occasions he raised
[52:45] the dead by faith in jesus'
[52:48] name such was his order in serving the
[52:51] lord that the devil was mightily
[52:56] aroused what is your
[53:00] testimony what is your testimony is the
[53:03] devil taking note of your
[53:05] presence because it talks about how
[53:08] upset that the devil was with Martin to
[53:10] the point that that that he would even
[53:11] send assassins to try to take his life
[53:13] for doing nothing other than standing
[53:15] for the word of God because I'll tell
[53:18] you this and we'll get into this later
[53:19] the things go hand in hand when you
[53:20] stand for the word of God the
[53:22] supernatural will follow and the
[53:24] supernatural going on you just start
[53:26] letting Supernatural take place you'll
[53:27] start making enemies that that you
[53:29] didn't even try to make you'll start
[53:31] having people not liking you and trying
[53:32] to call you out and you hadn't said
[53:34] nothing or done nothing you're just
[53:35] standing for the word of God you're just
[53:37] letting the supernatural move and people
[53:39] start taking note and people start
[53:41] hating you and brother brandham says the
[53:44] devil took note of Martin I want that to
[53:46] be my
[53:47] testimony I want that not that I care if
[53:49] the devil knows about me I want God to
[53:51] know me but I do want the devil to know
[53:53] that there's somebody down there shaking
[53:54] up my Kingdom there's somebody there
[53:57] that's tearing things up that's standing
[53:59] for truth that won't back off the word
[54:01] no matter how much lay at a see and
[54:02] pressure I put on them no matter how
[54:04] lukewarm other people get there's
[54:06] somebody down there that's still
[54:08] preaching it straight and truth and
[54:10] saying this is a Living Word with the
[54:12] Living God and there's a power under
[54:19] Resurrection says too often when men are
[54:21] signally used of the Lord they become
[54:23] lifted up with pride
[54:25] but not so with Martin he ever remained
[54:29] The Humble servant of God brother
[54:33] brandham says surely this was a great
[54:35] man a true Messenger to the age never
[54:38] desirous of all but to please God he
[54:43] lived the most consecrated
[54:46] life he says by signs and
[54:50] wonders by signs and wonders by the
[54:53] power of the spirit Martin was truly
[54:56] Vindicated as the messenger to that age
[54:59] but not only was he gifted by a great
[55:02] ministry he himself was forever true to
[55:06] the word of God I don't care how great
[55:08] your ministry is if you can't stay true
[55:11] to the word of
[55:13] God if you begin to get so lifted up
[55:16] that you think your ideas
[55:18] matter you will be
[55:20] humbled you will be brought down but he
[55:24] says he fought organization he with stod
[55:27] sin in high places he championed the
[55:30] truth in word and deed and lived out a
[55:34] full life of Christian Victory listen at
[55:39] the end of it all I hope I hope that can
[55:41] say that that that that the Lord worked
[55:42] through me to do some miraculous things
[55:44] and and all those things I I I believe
[55:46] that these signs shall follow them that
[55:48] believe I say it over and over we'll say
[55:49] it a bunch tonight but at the end of my
[55:51] life if time terries I hope people can
[55:54] say that he lived out a full life of
[55:56] Christian Victory because in the end
[55:58] that's what it's all about is the Holy
[56:00] Ghost you claim to have producing
[56:02] victory in your life you can produce
[56:04] signs and wonders and speak in tongues
[56:06] and shout and dance but I want you to
[56:08] produce Victory I'm looking for victory
[56:10] because it's the Victorious that's going
[56:12] to leave here it's the Victorious that's
[56:14] going to have a body change what we need
[56:16] in the lives of men and women tonight is
[56:18] VI victory Victorious
[56:23] lives dear in this age there was
[56:26] continued
[56:31] persecution scripture would tell us in
[56:33] John 16 and 2 they shall put you out of
[56:36] the synagogues yay the time cometh that
[56:39] whosoever kth you will think that he
[56:41] doeth God a service Matthew 24:9 then
[56:45] shall they deliver you up to be
[56:46] afflicted and shall kill you and you
[56:49] shall be hated of all Nations for my
[56:52] name's sake God was moving and the devil
[56:55] was stirred
[56:56] up the persecution of the previous age
[57:00] had not Abad and and looking there at
[57:02] John 162 where it says that whosoever
[57:04] kth you will think that he doeth God a
[57:08] service brother brandham says he says
[57:11] they were burned at the stake they were
[57:13] nailed to logs face down and wild dogs
[57:17] were turned loose upon them so that the
[57:20] dogs would tear away the Flesh and
[57:23] bowels leaving the victim to die in
[57:26] terrible torture babes were ripped from
[57:30] expecting mothers and thrown to the
[57:34] Hogs and he says what made it even worse
[57:36] is that a lot of this was being done by
[57:38] others who claimed to be
[57:40] Christians that thought they were
[57:42] stomping out you
[57:45] Heretics so they thought they were doing
[57:47] this to do God a
[57:49] service but as I read that and I didn't
[57:52] quote all of it because he goes on and
[57:54] on but you get get the point nailed the
[57:56] logs face down and wild dogs turn loose
[57:58] on them tear away their flesh and bowels
[58:01] babes ripped from expecting mothers
[58:03] thrown to the Hogs and I thought how do
[58:06] we even have the nerve to voice our
[58:09] trials and our
[58:13] tribulations how do we even have the
[58:15] nerve to ever
[58:18] complain how are we so caught up in the
[58:21] little things that would divide
[58:23] us
[58:25] H how have we gotten to the place that
[58:27] we're so soft as
[58:29] Christians that we actually gripe about
[58:31] the temperature in the church I know I
[58:34] get cold up here sometimes too I'm not
[58:37] talking about saying man it was cold but
[58:40] there are people who literally gripe and
[58:42] let it ruin their
[58:46] service I was so
[58:49] cold were you tied face down and Wild
[58:51] Dogs released upon you during the
[58:54] service
[59:00] I mean seriously we got to the place
[59:03] where we'll gripe about how loud a mic
[59:05] is or who's preaching or who's leading
[59:08] singing look we're all human we all have
[59:10] our likes and dislikes
[59:12] preferences you know nobody wants their
[59:14] ears to hurt because the mics were to
[59:16] nobody wants anything like that I
[59:19] understand Humanity but when it comes
[59:21] right down to it the amount of time and
[59:23] energy we put into into griping and into
[59:27] negativity when I'm saying just have the
[59:29] strength to push through have the
[59:31] strength to push that out of your mind
[59:33] and say I've gathered here to have
[59:34] service I've gathered here to hear from
[59:36] God and I'm going to do that no matter
[59:38] if things are perfect or not at least
[59:41] I'm not getting eaten by dogs or thrown
[59:43] to the Hogs or burned at the steak and
[59:45] none of that is happening here tonight I
[59:47] promise the Lord praise the
[59:51] Lord let's not be so soft
[59:55] let's recognize these people had their
[59:58] eyes on the
[59:59] prize these people if we could get that
[1:00:01] get our Focus back on the prize and why
[1:00:03] we gather and what we're doing and what
[1:00:05] we're fighting for and what the prize is
[1:00:07] and we start to let those little things
[1:00:09] fall off to the side and recognize look
[1:00:12] just around the curve we're going home
[1:00:14] we're right here on the final lap we're
[1:00:16] right here at the end of time I will not
[1:00:18] be distracted I will not be pulled off
[1:00:21] into negativity but I'm going to keep my
[1:00:23] eyes on the prize it's Rapture day it's
[1:00:25] going home time it's Victory Day let's
[1:00:28] bring our Focus back
[1:00:30] tonight they were Valiant and they were
[1:00:33] Brave and they went to their desk
[1:00:35] praising
[1:00:36] God praising God that they were
[1:00:39] accounted
[1:00:41] worthy
[1:00:43] my let that become our Focus again God
[1:00:47] let me be accounted worthy Lord to
[1:00:49] fulfill what you've called me to fulfill
[1:00:52] in this day and in this day he's not
[1:00:53] even calling you you to die for him he's
[1:00:56] calling you to live for him he's he Lord
[1:00:58] let me be accounted worthy to manifest
[1:01:01] you in this day to be a light shining in
[1:01:03] darkness in this last day to manifest
[1:01:06] you in this last
[1:01:11] age I mentioned this brother Brown says
[1:01:13] and the tragedy was even greater to
[1:01:16] think about when one realizes that this
[1:01:18] was not solely the work of
[1:01:20] heathen but many times it was caused by
[1:01:22] so-called Christians who felt that they
[1:01:25] did God a favor in Exterminating these
[1:01:26] loyal soldiers of the Cross who stood
[1:01:28] for the word and obedience to the holy
[1:01:31] spirit let me just throw this in as it
[1:01:33] comes to me don't
[1:01:34] ever be guilty of crucifying a
[1:01:41] brother many times we speak in anger or
[1:01:44] in haste or out of our
[1:01:47] emotions stop for a
[1:01:50] minute before we speak think for a
[1:01:53] minute before we speak
[1:01:55] forgive before we
[1:01:59] speak if you have completely forgiven
[1:02:02] before you speak you will never say
[1:02:04] something against someone you
[1:02:07] shouldn't forgive before we speak don't
[1:02:10] be guilty
[1:02:12] of being the
[1:02:16] ones that would bring
[1:02:18] persecution against those fighting the
[1:02:20] same fight we're
[1:02:22] fighting what you see here is the FAL
[1:02:24] false Vine lashing out at the True
[1:02:26] Vine false seed lashing out just like in
[1:02:30] Genesis where Cain lashed out at Abel
[1:02:32] and what it is is their worship is false
[1:02:35] and an example of true worship is placed
[1:02:37] in front of them and they're told this
[1:02:40] is what's right do this and you'll be
[1:02:42] accepted and instead of coming God's
[1:02:44] provided way they take the path of Cain
[1:02:47] Cain worship and they go the path of
[1:02:49] Cain and that is murder why well we
[1:02:52] dealt with a little bit of this on
[1:02:53] Sunday it's because their father was a
[1:02:55] murderer from the beginning they can't
[1:02:58] help but manifest what seed is within
[1:03:00] them
[1:03:03] amen verse 12 the
[1:03:06] salutation Revelations 2:12 and to the
[1:03:08] angel of the church in pergamus right
[1:03:11] these things saith he which hath a sharp
[1:03:14] sword with two
[1:03:17] edges I like to focus on that saith he
[1:03:19] who has the sharp sword with two
[1:03:22] edges key word there
[1:03:25] he let's find out who he is brother Bram
[1:03:29] tells us that this is just a further
[1:03:32] Revelation talking about Jesus of his
[1:03:35] godhead set forth by his
[1:03:38] association with the sharp two-edged
[1:03:41] sword which is we all should know the
[1:03:45] word of God so brother brandham says
[1:03:47] it's just a further it is a further
[1:03:50] revelation of his godhead set forth by
[1:03:53] his Association with the sharp two-edged
[1:03:55] sword which is the word of God so what
[1:03:58] is his association with it what is Jesus
[1:04:04] association with the word of God let's
[1:04:07] look at these scriptures and it'll tell
[1:04:08] us Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is
[1:04:12] quick and powerful and sharper than any
[1:04:15] two-edged sword so we find it right
[1:04:17] there we know that the two-edged sword
[1:04:19] that he's holding is the word of God
[1:04:22] Ephesians 6:17 and take the helmet of
[1:04:24] salvation and the sword of the spirit
[1:04:27] which is the word of God Revelation
[1:04:31] 19:15 and out of his mouth goeth a sharp
[1:04:35] sword so we're starting to see an
[1:04:37] association
[1:04:40] here says in Revelation
[1:04:43] 19:13 and he was clothed with a vesture
[1:04:46] dipped in blood in his name is called
[1:04:50] the word of God John 1:1 in the
[1:04:52] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:04:55] with God and the Word was God the same
[1:04:57] was in the beginning with God all things
[1:05:00] were made by him and without him was not
[1:05:02] anything made that was made and 1 John
[1:05:05] 5:7 says for there are three now this
[1:05:08] one just blows it all open if you're
[1:05:09] trying to figure out what are you saying
[1:05:12] what's the word who's the word for there
[1:05:14] are three that bear record in heaven the
[1:05:17] Father the
[1:05:19] word and the Holy Ghost and these three
[1:05:24] are
[1:05:25] one so just substitute it for what you
[1:05:27] normally hear there normally you would
[1:05:29] hear what the Father
[1:05:31] the and the Holy
[1:05:33] Ghost so who is the word
[1:05:37] Jesus he is the word brother Brown says
[1:05:40] now we can see his association with the
[1:05:43] word he is the word that is who he is
[1:05:47] the word is his
[1:05:51] name there in John 1 where it says in
[1:05:54] the beginning was the word the actual
[1:05:57] root for that is
[1:05:59] logos which means thought or
[1:06:03] concept and then brother brandham says
[1:06:05] it has a dual meaning which is thought
[1:06:07] and
[1:06:09] speech and remember we talked about this
[1:06:11] once again on Sunday a word is a thought
[1:06:15] expressed so what John says here in
[1:06:18] chapter one is is actually awesome he
[1:06:21] says that the concept of God
[1:06:25] the concept of God was expressed in
[1:06:28] Jesus that which had only men had
[1:06:31] thought about or had a concept of was
[1:06:33] now expressed in
[1:06:36] Jesus amen the expressed image of God
[1:06:41] brother Brown says God became expressed
[1:06:44] in the person of Jesus Christ Jesus was
[1:06:47] the expressed image of God again in John
[1:06:52] 1:14 and the word was made flesh and
[1:06:55] dwelt Among Us the very
[1:06:58] substance of God was made flesh and
[1:07:02] dwelt amongst us and as you think on
[1:07:06] that it's almost overwhelming when you
[1:07:07] think that the god that spoke worlds
[1:07:09] into existence the very God of creation
[1:07:13] the the god that scribes had written
[1:07:15] about the God that prophets had
[1:07:17] prophesized of was now standing there on
[1:07:20] the earth among men in a flesh body just
[1:07:23] like this right here expressing God to
[1:07:26] man manifesting God to man not God to
[1:07:29] man but man to man think about it like
[1:07:32] that you could handle him you could
[1:07:34] touch him you could see him he felt your
[1:07:37] infirmities he was here expressing God
[1:07:40] the fullness of God to man in a flesh
[1:07:42] body how how much of God all that God
[1:07:46] was he poured into Christ the whole
[1:07:50] thing before only Express in a cloud
[1:07:55] only expressed in a pillar of
[1:07:58] fire but now
[1:08:01] declared expressed manifested
[1:08:06] Emmanuel God With
[1:08:08] Us brother Brown says that is what the
[1:08:11] Living Word The Living Word Jesus did he
[1:08:16] brought God to us for he was God
[1:08:22] Amen
[1:08:24] John
[1:08:25] 14:10 says believest Thou not that I am
[1:08:28] in the father and the father in me the
[1:08:31] words that I speak unto you I speak not
[1:08:33] of myself but the father that dwelleth
[1:08:35] in me he doeth The
[1:08:38] Works brother Bram says here it is most
[1:08:40] evidently set forth that the perfect
[1:08:43] manifestation of God in the son was by
[1:08:46] the indwelling spirit manifesting in
[1:08:50] word and works that is is exactly what
[1:08:55] we have been teaching all
[1:08:58] along now watch he's going to go into
[1:09:00] some things here that that that people
[1:09:02] like to latch on to as reasons why you
[1:09:05] know the works don't matter and the
[1:09:06] experience don't matter and things like
[1:09:08] that but but if you'll keep following
[1:09:10] the thought he brings it all back around
[1:09:12] to this very quote right
[1:09:14] here he says when the
[1:09:17] bride will get back to being a word
[1:09:22] bride oh we're all about the word it's
[1:09:25] word word word I
[1:09:28] agree 100% so let's read the quote
[1:09:31] together since we're all agree she will
[1:09:34] produce the very works that Jesus
[1:09:37] produced the word is God the spirit is
[1:09:41] God they are all one one cannot work
[1:09:46] apart from the
[1:09:48] other then quit trying to separate the
[1:09:52] two quit trying to pull them
[1:09:55] apart I tell you the elect won't receive
[1:09:58] a dead
[1:09:59] word the elect won't Won Won won't fall
[1:10:02] for a word that doesn't have life in
[1:10:05] it because she knows we know the elect
[1:10:08] knows that that if we're truly back to
[1:10:11] the word if we are truly focused on the
[1:10:13] word we're focused on the word we're
[1:10:15] focused on the word then the works must
[1:10:18] be
[1:10:19] there yesly you can't separate the two
[1:10:23] and way one cannot work apart from the
[1:10:28] other and I and I looked at that today
[1:10:31] and I dwelled on that and thought about
[1:10:32] it I thought how confused does does one
[1:10:34] have to
[1:10:35] be to hear Ministry preach the
[1:10:40] supernatural to hear Ministry preach
[1:10:42] about healings and miracles to preach
[1:10:44] signs and wonders to preach about gifts
[1:10:46] operating and that the shout of the king
[1:10:49] supposed to be in the count in the camp
[1:10:52] and then that person say
[1:10:54] well y'all are focusing too much on that
[1:10:56] and not on the
[1:10:59] word that's a confused
[1:11:03] person when those things are the very
[1:11:06] things that the word
[1:11:08] produces so what I'm trying to say is
[1:11:10] and I may say it again if you're not
[1:11:12] producing that it's proof that you're
[1:11:13] not truly focused on the word your
[1:11:17] source is
[1:11:18] contaminated you're not drinking from
[1:11:20] the Eternal perfect Source like we
[1:11:22] talked about on Sunday but a
[1:11:24] contaminated Source will separate it and
[1:11:26] you'll have a dead
[1:11:31] word well let's keep things in balance
[1:11:35] that has become a buzzword for let's
[1:11:36] keep things
[1:11:41] dead you know I told somebody just
[1:11:44] yesterday in conversation a group of us
[1:11:45] were talking and I said you know I
[1:11:48] understand that our balance and God's
[1:11:49] balance are two different things when we
[1:11:51] think balance we think like 50/50 it's
[1:11:53] balance but God's balance is whatever is
[1:11:57] needed it may however he wants it that's
[1:12:00] balance but if we're just going to look
[1:12:02] at it from the way we think about
[1:12:04] balance we could preach nothing but the
[1:12:06] moving of the spirit from now in the
[1:12:08] next 25 years and we would never balance
[1:12:10] out all the dead cold formal teachings
[1:12:12] that we've been having for the last
[1:12:13] couple
[1:12:16] decades just to try to bring things Back
[1:12:19] in
[1:12:20] Balance they've been so out of balance
[1:12:23] for so
[1:12:26] long we we do need balance that's the
[1:12:30] truth we need to bring it balance to all
[1:12:32] the dead cold formal ritualistic
[1:12:35] teachings that's been going on forever
[1:12:36] and ever to where we ended up with
[1:12:38] churches full of cold dead formal
[1:12:40] Christians sitting on the Pew with no
[1:12:42] life in them we need to balance that out
[1:12:44] we need the fire of God to come and
[1:12:46] Purge it and balancing out to where we
[1:12:48] got a people on fire for God Walking
[1:12:50] with God expressing God manifesting God
[1:12:53] the very image of God manifested again
[1:12:56] and
[1:12:57] [Applause]
[1:13:00] abroad but too many of us are
[1:13:02] manifesting
[1:13:11] Church word word word yes yes yes I
[1:13:16] don't know anyone who disagrees with
[1:13:19] that but what you're saying is not true
[1:13:21] because if your focus was on the word
[1:13:23] you're going to produce the works of
[1:13:25] that
[1:13:26] word The Works of John 14:12 The Works
[1:13:30] that Jesus
[1:13:32] produced brother Brown says the word
[1:13:35] always comes to the truly spirit
[1:13:39] filled I want you to stay close with
[1:13:42] this for a little bit that is the
[1:13:44] evidence of being filled with the Holy
[1:13:46] Ghost that is what Jesus said would be
[1:13:52] the evidence
[1:13:54] so let's look at this for a moment the
[1:13:56] spirit and the word John
[1:13:58] 14:16 and I will pray the father and he
[1:14:01] shall give you another
[1:14:03] comforter that he may abide with you
[1:14:05] forever so he's talking about the Holy
[1:14:08] Ghost even the spirit of
[1:14:11] Truth whom the world cannot
[1:14:14] receive so just hold that for a second
[1:14:16] as we go to the as we go to the next one
[1:14:20] but he says here the world cannot
[1:14:21] receive the spirit of Truth
[1:14:24] then what is
[1:14:26] truth John
[1:14:28] 17:17 sanctify them through thy
[1:14:32] truth Thy word is
[1:14:36] truth John 8:43 why do you not
[1:14:40] understand my
[1:14:41] speech even because you cannot hear my
[1:14:45] word so they can't receive the Holy
[1:14:48] Ghost we saw that in in chapter 14:1 17
[1:14:51] they can't it says the world can't
[1:14:52] receive it
[1:14:54] and in John 8:43 they can't receive the
[1:14:57] word why not why couldn't they receive
[1:15:00] one and not the
[1:15:01] other because they're the same
[1:15:06] thing they are the same thing watch this
[1:15:11] now John
[1:15:14] 16:13 how be it when he the spirit of
[1:15:16] Truth the word the Holy
[1:15:19] Ghost is come he will guide you into to
[1:15:23] all
[1:15:24] truth so let's just stop and let's just
[1:15:26] put this together like like a basic
[1:15:28] equation if you have the Holy Ghost can
[1:15:30] you walk and live in
[1:15:33] error doesn't mean you'll never mess up
[1:15:35] but what's he going to do he's going to
[1:15:37] guide
[1:15:39] you back into all truth you're going to
[1:15:41] be in the
[1:15:44] truth for he shall not speak of himself
[1:15:46] but whatsoever he shall hear that shall
[1:15:49] he speak and he will show you things to
[1:15:51] come so the spirit of truth here the
[1:15:54] word is going to guide you into all
[1:15:57] truth in other words all the word which
[1:15:59] in this day there's only one place where
[1:16:01] you can find all the
[1:16:03] word that's the message of the
[1:16:07] hour so what's this saying let's put it
[1:16:09] in PL plain English you cannot be a word
[1:16:13] rejector and claim that you have the
[1:16:15] Holy
[1:16:17] Ghost you cannot look to a sign or a
[1:16:20] gift as the evidence and then parts of
[1:16:23] the word and claim to be spirit filled
[1:16:27] that's what Pentecost did that was the
[1:16:30] error of Pentecost it's not that they
[1:16:32] accepted the gifts they were supposed to
[1:16:34] accept the gifts it was the restoration
[1:16:37] of the gifts is that they then rejected
[1:16:41] the word and claimed that they
[1:16:45] had the the the the authentic Holy
[1:16:50] Ghost they denied the word they claimed
[1:16:52] to have the Holy Ghost yes they had been
[1:16:55] anointed sure the spirit of God had
[1:16:57] moved on them and amongst them
[1:17:00] absolutely all right but the rejection
[1:17:02] of the word proved that they were not
[1:17:05] the spoken word seed bride how can the
[1:17:07] spoken word bride reject the
[1:17:12] word it proved that they were not the
[1:17:14] original they didn't have the life in
[1:17:16] them it had passed through
[1:17:19] them brother Bram says here I want you
[1:17:23] to note very
[1:17:24] carefully that Jesus did not say that
[1:17:27] the evidence of being baptized with the
[1:17:30] Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues now I
[1:17:32] I want everyone to focus here because I
[1:17:35] believe that you
[1:17:38] know and if you that we believe in
[1:17:40] speaking in tongues and shouting and
[1:17:42] dancing and if you're a student of the
[1:17:44] message at all you'll know that brother
[1:17:46] brownon believed in it
[1:17:48] too but he's making it very clear so
[1:17:51] there's no confusion young people I want
[1:17:53] you to to to understand this very
[1:17:59] clear the evidence of being baptized
[1:18:01] with the Holy Ghost he says Jesus did
[1:18:03] not say the evidence of being baptized
[1:18:04] with the Holy Ghost was speaking in
[1:18:05] tongues interpreting prophesying or
[1:18:09] shouting and dancing he said the
[1:18:11] evidence would be that you would be in
[1:18:13] the truth you would be in the word of
[1:18:17] God for your
[1:18:19] age in other words what he's saying here
[1:18:21] is the Holy Ghost in a person cannot
[1:18:23] feed on Creeds and dogmas it can't feed
[1:18:26] on partial truths and denominational
[1:18:29] ideas the Holy Ghost will be identified
[1:18:32] with the light of the day it'll call you
[1:18:35] out of Darkness it'll bring you to the
[1:18:36] truth every single time and with the
[1:18:40] spirit of God in you you can't help but
[1:18:42] see the the truth for your day because
[1:18:44] he is the spirit of
[1:18:51] Truth he says have you noticed
[1:18:54] in Revelation 22:17 and the spirit and
[1:18:57] the bride say come and let him that
[1:18:58] Hearth say come see the bride speaks the
[1:19:01] same word as the spirit she is a word
[1:19:03] bride proving she has the
[1:19:06] spirit in every Church age we hear these
[1:19:08] words he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:19:10] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[1:19:13] the spirit gives the word if you have
[1:19:16] the spirit you will hear the word for
[1:19:20] your
[1:19:21] age as those true true Christians took
[1:19:23] the word for their age that's what it
[1:19:26] says in John 8:47 and he that is of God
[1:19:30] heareth God's words ye therefore hear
[1:19:33] them not because you are not of God when
[1:19:35] you can't receive truth it shows you are
[1:19:37] not of
[1:19:39] God now I want to notice I I want you to
[1:19:41] notice I want to stop before we run off
[1:19:43] into easy
[1:19:44] believism and say well all you got to do
[1:19:46] is be in the message and that's proof
[1:19:47] you got the Holy Ghost that's not what
[1:19:48] he's
[1:19:50] saying it's kind of like paying ties
[1:19:53] don't make you a Christian but
[1:19:54] Christians will pay
[1:19:57] tith being in the message don't make you
[1:20:00] filled with the Holy Ghost but if you're
[1:20:01] filled with the Holy Ghost you'll be in
[1:20:02] the
[1:20:04] message do you understand that it it's
[1:20:07] not you you if you have the Holy Ghost
[1:20:10] you will be in the truth you will be in
[1:20:13] the message if you have the spirit you
[1:20:16] will hear the word but that doesn't mean
[1:20:18] if you in the message you have the Holy
[1:20:21] Ghost if you truly have the Holy Ghost
[1:20:24] and you have that word that life living
[1:20:26] on the inside of you it will produce a
[1:20:28] life to back up your
[1:20:31] claim be being in the uh in the message
[1:20:35] is more than just admitting that the
[1:20:37] message is
[1:20:38] Right coming to the word is more than
[1:20:41] just seeing that it's
[1:20:43] true Nic Nicodemus knew that it was
[1:20:47] true he
[1:20:48] knew and he said that they all
[1:20:51] knew they all knew the message was right
[1:20:54] did that make them all saved now they
[1:20:56] crucified Jesus knowing that the message
[1:20:58] was the
[1:20:59] truth he said we all know you come from
[1:21:03] God in other words yeah I see that the
[1:21:06] message is
[1:21:07] right that didn't mean they were saved
[1:21:09] and had the Holy Ghost far from it but
[1:21:13] it's when you allow the word or the
[1:21:15] message or the truth of the day to
[1:21:17] change your
[1:21:20] life there's many of people that sit
[1:21:22] right in the water and
[1:21:24] rot they'll sit right there and rot
[1:21:26] there's many that do that they'll listen
[1:21:29] to the truth and rot but when the spirit
[1:21:31] is there they'll receive that word and
[1:21:34] the evidence of it will be a changed
[1:21:38] life that's the evidence of it brother
[1:21:41] brandham
[1:21:42] says he talks about tongues and other
[1:21:45] gifts are
[1:21:46] manifestations he says they're not signs
[1:21:49] that you have the Holy Ghost no just
[1:21:51] because some people will take that and
[1:21:53] go see that's why we don't need it
[1:21:54] that's not what he says he makes it very
[1:21:56] clear let's just keep going he says why
[1:21:58] isn't the manifestation an Evidence of
[1:22:01] being baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:22:03] because you surely could not manifest
[1:22:06] the Holy Ghost unless you were truly
[1:22:07] Spirit-filled he asking a question and
[1:22:10] then he says you know I hate to say this
[1:22:12] because I don't want to hurt anybody's
[1:22:13] feelings he says but you can manifest
[1:22:16] the Holy Ghost without having he says
[1:22:18] you can have
[1:22:19] manifestations of the Holy Ghost without
[1:22:22] being spirit filled he says so where is
[1:22:25] manifestation as an Evidence it isn't
[1:22:28] there if you are truly filled with the
[1:22:31] spirit of God you will have the evidence
[1:22:33] of the word in your life now we'll find
[1:22:38] what is the evidence of the word in your
[1:22:40] life and we'll get to that but talking
[1:22:43] about manifestations and being the the
[1:22:45] the evidence of the Holy Ghost he goes
[1:22:47] through several examples he points back
[1:22:49] to balum and he says balum was religious
[1:22:52] and he worshiped God he said in talking
[1:22:55] about manifestations he says he says the
[1:22:57] spirit of God manifested through him
[1:22:59] we're talking about balum in one of the
[1:23:01] most beautiful portions of absolute
[1:23:03] accurate prophecy the world has ever
[1:23:07] seen but his sure wasn't filled with the
[1:23:09] Holy Ghost now I understand that was
[1:23:12] before that it was given but that's how
[1:23:13] brother brownon would describe it he he
[1:23:15] wasn't he wasn't
[1:23:17] seed he says now then what do you think
[1:23:20] of caiaphus the high priest the ible
[1:23:22] says he prophesies the kind of death the
[1:23:24] Lord would die we all know there's no
[1:23:27] record of him being Spirit-filled and
[1:23:30] then he goes into the examples and
[1:23:31] starts talking about the two preachers
[1:23:34] there early on when he was first
[1:23:35] introduced to the Pentecostal people and
[1:23:38] he talks about how they were speaking
[1:23:39] with tongues and interpreting and and he
[1:23:41] wanted to know more about it so he came
[1:23:43] up and began to speak to
[1:23:45] them and he said one was a
[1:23:48] hypocrite and the other a genuine
[1:23:51] Christian he says here were two men one
[1:23:54] of which was a real believer and the
[1:23:57] other was a sinful
[1:23:59] impersonator yet both were manifesting
[1:24:02] gifts of the
[1:24:07] Spirit so so what you're saying brother
[1:24:09] Aaron is we don't want these
[1:24:11] manifestations of course we want these
[1:24:14] manifestations we don't want you to
[1:24:16] arrest your holy ghost on these Eternal
[1:24:18] manif on these manifestations we don't
[1:24:21] want you going I know I got it because I
[1:24:23] spoke in tongues I know I got it because
[1:24:26] the this thing swept over me and caused
[1:24:28] me to dance in the spirit no you don't
[1:24:30] know you got it you had a manifestation
[1:24:34] of the
[1:24:35] spirit the prophet's just saying don't
[1:24:37] rest your soul on a gift or a tongue or
[1:24:40] a shout or a dance that's it don't rest
[1:24:44] on them they're not the evidence of the
[1:24:47] Holy Ghost but what they are is evidence
[1:24:51] that the Holy Ghost is present and he is
[1:24:53] working in our midst who doesn't want
[1:25:00] that just a Ju Just you as an
[1:25:05] individual as a church we want those
[1:25:08] things it is evidence of God moving in
[1:25:10] our midst but as an individual you are
[1:25:13] not to rest your soul on that
[1:25:15] alone he says I will admit now pay
[1:25:18] attention because this the every one of
[1:25:20] these quotes are from the pergami and
[1:25:23] age in
[1:25:24] order okay I will admit that true
[1:25:27] manifestations is the evidence of the
[1:25:30] Holy Spirit doing Mighty acts I'll take
[1:25:35] it I want the Holy Spirit to do Mighty
[1:25:37] acts in evening like
[1:25:39] Tabernacle I want it to do in every
[1:25:41] church I want it in my home I want the
[1:25:43] Holy Spirit to do Mighty acts period so
[1:25:46] now that we've settled that but it is
[1:25:49] not the evidence of the individual being
[1:25:52] spirit filled even though that
[1:25:54] individual has an abundance of those
[1:25:58] manifestations you speak in tongues all
[1:26:00] the time interpret all the time Dance
[1:26:02] all the time shout all the time run
[1:26:04] around the building all the time word of
[1:26:06] w knowledge you name them and not have
[1:26:09] the Holy
[1:26:12] Ghost he's being very clear about
[1:26:15] that now notice now notice cuz people
[1:26:19] like to hang on this first part but then
[1:26:22] focus on the second part Jesus never did
[1:26:25] stress the importance of the works as he
[1:26:27] did the word we're
[1:26:30] done never did I say
[1:26:33] Amen but I also say let's let's take all
[1:26:36] of
[1:26:36] it why because he knew that if the
[1:26:41] people got the word The Works would
[1:26:45] follow if people get the word The Works
[1:26:49] will follow that is
[1:26:53] Bible amen I I say I want the works here
[1:26:57] so that I know for sure that what I'm
[1:26:59] feeding on is the word it is so so he
[1:27:03] says you'll have the evidence of the
[1:27:05] word in your life is the evidence of the
[1:27:06] Holy Ghost then he comes and tells you
[1:27:09] what is the evidence that the word is
[1:27:11] there The Works Will
[1:27:14] Follow The Works will
[1:27:17] follow that is Bible no we don't chase
[1:27:21] after a gift
[1:27:22] no we don't look look look for tongues
[1:27:25] no we aren't sign
[1:27:28] Seekers but if you are in the word and
[1:27:30] the word in you come on now yes preach
[1:27:34] the word yes focus on the word yes
[1:27:37] emphasize the word because if that's
[1:27:39] truly what you're doing the spirit's
[1:27:42] going to
[1:27:43] move that's how it works if you're
[1:27:45] focused on the word and preaching the
[1:27:47] word the Miracles will take place the
[1:27:49] Devils will be cast out the Lost will be
[1:27:52] saved those with need the Holy Ghost
[1:27:54] will be filled with the Holy Ghost the
[1:27:55] shout of the king will be in the camp
[1:27:58] when you preach the word when you focus
[1:28:01] on the word all those things are going
[1:28:03] to follow and if they're not it's
[1:28:06] because you have departed from the word
[1:28:08] you so desperately claim to
[1:28:12] [Music]
[1:28:17] promote I'll be honest with you I'm
[1:28:19] ready for a lot of folks that claim to
[1:28:21] only focus on the word to actually start
[1:28:23] doing that because when they do look out
[1:28:27] it's going to break out in their Church
[1:28:29] they ain't going to be able to contain
[1:28:30] it they ain't going to know what's going
[1:28:31] on we were just focusing on the word I
[1:28:33] know that's what we've been doing for a
[1:28:34] while now we've been loving it we're
[1:28:36] focusing on the word we're focusing on
[1:28:38] the word and signs follow and the sick
[1:28:40] are healed and people speak in tongues
[1:28:42] and people get happy and there's emotion
[1:28:44] that goes with it because we see our
[1:28:46] name on the last book of life that was
[1:28:48] written there before the foundation of
[1:28:49] the world what are you so excited about
[1:28:51] the word why are y'all running around
[1:28:53] the church the word why are you so
[1:28:55] emotional the word it's what we focus
[1:28:59] [Applause]
[1:29:08] on I don't know why that's so
[1:29:15] small we got giant screens and it's
[1:29:17] still
[1:29:18] tiny it ain't little here so I don't
[1:29:20] know what happened anyway I'll read it
[1:29:22] to you if you want deity in your
[1:29:25] midst then
[1:29:27] welcome and receive the word you're
[1:29:30] going to have to trust me that that's
[1:29:31] what it
[1:29:34] says welcome and receive the word how do
[1:29:38] you welcome the
[1:29:41] word by proper Church
[1:29:44] order by sitting very quiet and
[1:29:47] nodding which if I do it just right I
[1:29:50] can sleep and do it and people will
[1:29:52] never
[1:29:55] know that how do you welcome and receive
[1:29:59] the
[1:30:00] word you welcome it by how you respond
[1:30:03] to
[1:30:04] it there's a lot of places that the word
[1:30:07] isn't
[1:30:08] welcome and you can tell by the response
[1:30:10] to the word the next one says I wonder
[1:30:14] if we are sufficiently impressed with
[1:30:17] the word in our midst how many of you
[1:30:19] ever heard that quote before
[1:30:22] and I'll tell you this as you as you
[1:30:24] travel and get around what you'll find
[1:30:25] is it's a quote actually used to kind of
[1:30:28] suppress the moving of the spirit and
[1:30:30] the works and all those things are like
[1:30:31] well we have to be sufficiently
[1:30:32] impressed by the word in our midst it's
[1:30:35] about being sufficiently you know
[1:30:38] impressed or you know by by the word in
[1:30:41] our Ament we show how impressed we are
[1:30:43] by how we respond to it that shows you
[1:30:46] how impressed you are by the word the
[1:30:49] Pharisees were not impressed by the word
[1:30:51] in their midst so they put Jesus in a
[1:30:52] corner with dirty feet direct
[1:30:54] correlation if you're impressed by the
[1:30:56] word you will worship him you will
[1:30:58] praise him you will shout you will cry
[1:31:01] if you are sufficiently impressed by the
[1:31:02] word you won't have him stuck over in a
[1:31:04] corner but when you're not sufficiently
[1:31:07] impressed by the word you stick him
[1:31:08] there and then criticize everybody that
[1:31:10] washes his feet with their tears and
[1:31:13] dries it with their hair but that's okay
[1:31:15] I choose to be one of those that is
[1:31:17] impressed by the word and so it excites
[1:31:19] me I'm impressed by him so I worship him
[1:31:22] I'm impressed by him so I give him my
[1:31:29] everything it's the exact opposite of
[1:31:31] what people use that quote
[1:31:36] for you want God to move then welcome
[1:31:38] his word respond to his word worship
[1:31:41] accept it and see what begins to happen
[1:31:44] the last quote up there says if the
[1:31:47] church way back there in that third age
[1:31:50] had only held on to the re revelation of
[1:31:53] the Living Word in their midst the power
[1:31:56] of God would not have
[1:31:58] faded as it did in those Dark
[1:32:03] Ages if the church back then would have
[1:32:06] held on to the revelation of what that
[1:32:09] it was a Living Word he said that it was
[1:32:13] life in it that signs followed that
[1:32:16] worship was supposed to be in spirit and
[1:32:18] in truth that it was more than just
[1:32:20] doctrines and forms and traditions if
[1:32:23] they would have fought for the moving of
[1:32:25] a living God he says the power of God
[1:32:27] would not have faded as it did in those
[1:32:31] Dark
[1:32:33] Ages there we go the acts of God in our
[1:32:38] midst brother Brown says and right today
[1:32:42] I love this this brought such joy to me
[1:32:45] when the church returns to the word in
[1:32:47] faith we can say without a doubt that
[1:32:51] the glory of God and the wonderful acts
[1:32:54] of God will be in her midst again so if
[1:32:58] we've returned to the word what can we
[1:33:00] expect the wonderful works and the
[1:33:02] wonderful acts to be in our midst again
[1:33:06] if we have not returned the word then we
[1:33:08] can expect
[1:33:14] crickets but when you return to the word
[1:33:17] you have a right to expect the glory of
[1:33:21] God and the wonderful acts of God to
[1:33:23] move in our midst
[1:33:25] again he says whatever life was in the
[1:33:28] seed came forth into a plant and then
[1:33:31] into Fruit the very same law applies to
[1:33:33] the church today whatever seed started
[1:33:36] the church will come forth and be like
[1:33:38] the Original Seed because it is the same
[1:33:40] seed in these last days the true bride
[1:33:44] Church Christ seed will come to The
[1:33:46] Headstone and she will be a super Church
[1:33:49] a super race as she nears him they and
[1:33:52] the bride will be so much like him that
[1:33:54] they will even be in his very image this
[1:33:57] is in order to be United with him they
[1:33:59] will be one they will be the very
[1:34:02] manifestation of the word of the Living
[1:34:08] God so much like him that the sick stay
[1:34:14] sick so much like him that the Lost day
[1:34:18] lost so much like him that sin goes unch
[1:34:21] in the
[1:34:22] church so much like him that we reject
[1:34:25] the gifts that he sent
[1:34:27] us so much like him that we don't want
[1:34:30] his Spirit moving amongst
[1:34:33] us can you imagine actually being so
[1:34:35] different from him that his presence
[1:34:37] doesn't bring emotion in your
[1:34:41] life being so different from him that a
[1:34:45] Revival in the church doesn't bring
[1:34:48] emotion but
[1:34:49] criticism that you can look at and
[1:34:52] criticize it because you're so different
[1:34:54] from him you don't recognize
[1:34:57] him so different from him and therefore
[1:35:00] you're not impressed with the word in
[1:35:02] your
[1:35:04] midst and you put him in the corner and
[1:35:06] criticize those that begin to worship
[1:35:08] and praise him not this
[1:35:11] bride no that's not how this bride's
[1:35:13] going to act she's going to be so much
[1:35:14] like him she's going to be a super
[1:35:16] Church a super race in His image an army
[1:35:19] that cannot be defeated an army that
[1:35:21] cannot be stopped an army that acts how
[1:35:23] he act when he was here when we meet a
[1:35:25] devil the devil's cast out when there's
[1:35:27] sickness we lay hands on the sick they
[1:35:28] shall recover there's still those filled
[1:35:30] with the Holy Ghost there's still those
[1:35:32] delivered from addiction there's those
[1:35:34] delivered from pornography there's those
[1:35:35] delivered from depression why his body's
[1:35:38] upon the Earth and she's so much like
[1:35:40] him she's doing exactly what he did when
[1:35:43] he was here why must we be like him so
[1:35:46] we can be United with him bone of his
[1:35:49] bone flesh of his flesh she is
[1:35:55] him doing his Works overcoming this
[1:35:58] world why because we're impressed with
[1:36:01] the
[1:36:03] word and we've accepted it and we're
[1:36:05] allowing it to do its work in
[1:36:10] US those in the bride do only his will
[1:36:14] no one can make them do otherwise they
[1:36:17] have thus sayith the Lord or they keep
[1:36:19] still they know that it has to be in
[1:36:21] them doing the works fulfilling his own
[1:36:27] word he did not complete all his work
[1:36:30] while in his Earthly Ministry so now he
[1:36:32] works in and through the bride she knows
[1:36:37] that for it was not yet time for him to
[1:36:39] do certain things that he must do now
[1:36:43] but he will now fulfill through the
[1:36:45] bride that work which he left for this
[1:36:49] specific time
[1:36:52] brother Joe we're going to finish
[1:36:54] this you can't do away with the works or
[1:36:57] you've done away with the
[1:37:00] word there's works for us to do the same
[1:37:03] works if you do away with that you do
[1:37:06] away with John
[1:37:08] 1412 and so many other scriptures
[1:37:10] there's works that we have to
[1:37:16] do Revelations 2:
[1:37:19] 13 we're bring bringing this down we're
[1:37:21] getting close to the
[1:37:23] end says I Know Thy works and where thou
[1:37:26] dwellest even where Satan's seat is and
[1:37:29] thou holdest fast my name and Hast not
[1:37:31] denied my faith even in those days where
[1:37:34] in Antipas was my faithful martyr who
[1:37:36] was slain among you where Satan
[1:37:41] dwelleth speaking of works here he says
[1:37:44] I Know Thy Works brother Bram says these
[1:37:46] are the identical words uttered to each
[1:37:48] of the seven Messengers relative to the
[1:37:50] people of God in each age as they are
[1:37:53] spoken to the two Vines the true and
[1:37:56] false they will bring joy and gladness
[1:37:58] to the hearts of one
[1:38:00] group but they ought to strike fear
[1:38:03] strike Terror in the hearts of the other
[1:38:06] other yes it's true that we're saved by
[1:38:09] grace and not of
[1:38:10] Works we're saved by grace we're not
[1:38:12] saved by works but true salvation will
[1:38:15] bring to pass works or deeds that are
[1:38:17] pleasing to God and he says I Know Thy
[1:38:20] works
[1:38:22] 1 John 3:7 says little children let no
[1:38:24] man deceive you he that doeth that means
[1:38:27] worketh righteousness is righteous even
[1:38:30] as he is righteous brother Brown says if
[1:38:32] this verse means anything at all it
[1:38:34] means that what a man
[1:38:36] does he
[1:38:39] is Matthew 12:33 says either make the
[1:38:42] tree good and his fruit good or else
[1:38:45] make the tree corrupt and his fruit
[1:38:47] corrupt for the tree is known by his
[1:38:50] fruit you can't do away with the
[1:38:52] works he says oh Generation of Vipers
[1:38:55] how can you being evil speak good things
[1:38:58] for out of the abundance of the heart
[1:39:01] speaketh the
[1:39:02] mouth he says I Know Thy works if a man
[1:39:06] fears if you're sitting here today and
[1:39:08] this is where you're at if a man fears
[1:39:10] that he might not please God then let
[1:39:12] him fulfill the
[1:39:14] word if a man wonders if he will hear
[1:39:16] those words well done good and faithful
[1:39:18] servant let him fulfill the word of God
[1:39:21] in his life and assuredly he will hear
[1:39:24] those words of Praise he says if a man
[1:39:27] wants to know how he's making out let
[1:39:29] him do as James suggested look into the
[1:39:32] mirror of God's
[1:39:36] word he goes on to say difficult though
[1:39:39] it was at times to serve the Lord yet
[1:39:42] they served him and worshiped him in
[1:39:44] spirit and in truth but with the false
[1:39:47] Vine it was not so alas they had
[1:39:49] repudiated the life that is built upon
[1:39:52] the word and we're now going further and
[1:39:54] further away from the truth how it must
[1:39:57] have pleased God in this age of
[1:39:59] persecution in this age where they were
[1:40:01] being killed and murdered and
[1:40:02] slaughtered that despite all that and
[1:40:04] despite the persecution there was an
[1:40:06] elect group that wouldn't back down that
[1:40:09] were still holding on to the truth and
[1:40:11] still pressing on still letting the word
[1:40:13] live in their hearts live in their lives
[1:40:15] and their Works indicated that this was
[1:40:18] the
[1:40:19] truth he he goes on to say in this verse
[1:40:21] that thou holdest my name
[1:40:24] fast to whom can we go thou alone Hast
[1:40:28] the words of eternal life they held fast
[1:40:31] then they were holding fast now but not
[1:40:33] with fatalistic dread as men who live
[1:40:36] out bar and lives they were holding fast
[1:40:38] in his strength in the Assurance of the
[1:40:41] spirit that they were one in
[1:40:44] him they knew and they loved that name
[1:40:48] and they knew it was above every other
[1:40:49] name there their knees had bowed to that
[1:40:52] name their tongues had confessed to it
[1:40:54] whatsoever they did they did it all in
[1:40:56] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:41:00] why is he why why is Jesus pointing this
[1:41:02] out as he's speaking here thou holdest
[1:41:04] fast my name because in this time the
[1:41:07] name of Jesus was being pushed
[1:41:09] completely aside it was being pushed
[1:41:11] aside in titles of Father Son and Holy
[1:41:13] Ghost had completely taken over the
[1:41:15] church the the so-called church was
[1:41:18] drying up and embracing the Trinity
[1:41:20] Doctrine and yet there was somebody that
[1:41:21] was still going to know we're going to
[1:41:23] baptize in the name of Jesus we're going
[1:41:25] to pray in the name of Jesus we're going
[1:41:27] to believe in the name of Jesus we're
[1:41:29] going to stand on the name of Jesus we
[1:41:31] know Salvation comes in the name of
[1:41:33] Jesus and he's saying thou held fast my
[1:41:35] name you kept holding on to my name when
[1:41:38] others cast it aside but you still held
[1:41:42] on still on that he says with so many
[1:41:45] dishonoring God turning him into three
[1:41:47] gods and changing his gracious name to
[1:41:49] titles one would would
[1:41:51] wonder I love this so much he says one
[1:41:54] would wonder if the signs and wonders
[1:41:57] that attend such a great name would
[1:41:58] still be visited amongst the people
[1:42:01] indeed those signs were mightily and
[1:42:03] wonderfully manifested though certainly
[1:42:05] not in the false Vine men like Martin
[1:42:08] were greatly used and God bore them
[1:42:10] witness both by signs and wonders and
[1:42:13] Gifts of the Holy Ghost that name was
[1:42:15] still effectual as it always has been
[1:42:18] and ever will be where the Saints honor
[1:42:21] him through word and faith I say tonight
[1:42:25] the name of Jesus is still as effectual
[1:42:27] as it's ever been it's still heals it
[1:42:29] still delivers it'll still fill you with
[1:42:31] the Holy Ghost in places where his name
[1:42:33] is honored and lifted up there are still
[1:42:36] signs there are still wonders and Gifts
[1:42:38] of the Holy Ghost anywhere Saints honor
[1:42:42] him anywhere that people are
[1:42:44] sufficiently impressed with the word
[1:42:47] that's why he moves here that's why he
[1:42:50] moves in Virginia that's why he moves in
[1:42:53] Tennessee and Arkansas and Europe and
[1:42:55] everywhere else it's a word
[1:42:59] Revival people who are sufficiently
[1:43:02] impressed with the word and that word
[1:43:05] brings
[1:43:08] life he says Thou Hast not denied my
[1:43:12] faith acts
[1:43:15] 3:16 Peter is here is describing the
[1:43:17] Miracle at the gate called
[1:43:19] beautiful and he says in his name he's
[1:43:22] telling them how it happened through
[1:43:24] faith in his name so and his name
[1:43:29] through faith in his name hath made this
[1:43:32] man strong whom you see and know yay the
[1:43:35] faith which is by
[1:43:38] him hath given him the man this
[1:43:42] perfect soundness in the presence of you
[1:43:44] all notice Peter did not claim it was
[1:43:47] his own human Faith any more than he
[1:43:49] claimed it was his own own
[1:43:51] name what was it he said it was the name
[1:43:55] of Jesus and he used the faith that
[1:43:58] Jesus
[1:44:00] gives to perform that
[1:44:03] Miracle what's it say in Revelation 2:13
[1:44:06] I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest
[1:44:09] even where Satan's seat is and thou
[1:44:10] holdest fast my name and Hast not denied
[1:44:14] my
[1:44:15] faith it's not your
[1:44:18] faith says Thou Hast not denied my faith
[1:44:22] it was his faith it was not faith in him
[1:44:26] but it was his own faith that he made
[1:44:29] that he had given to Believers listen
[1:44:31] your faith isn't
[1:44:33] weak oh I I don't know about my faith I
[1:44:35] don't know if I got enough Faith to be
[1:44:37] healed I don't know if I got enough
[1:44:38] faith for a Rapture I I think the faith
[1:44:40] that he gave you which is his faith is
[1:44:42] going to be exactly what you have need
[1:44:43] of just start putting trust in the fact
[1:44:45] that it ain't even your faith don't even
[1:44:47] just start casting down your doubts and
[1:44:49] start realizing he gave me a Measure of
[1:44:51] Faith it's his faith that's going to
[1:44:53] take me out of here it's his faith
[1:44:55] that's going to change my body it's his
[1:44:57] faith that's going to take me in a
[1:44:59] Rapture he knew you didn't have enough
[1:45:01] Faith so he supplied the faith he gave
[1:45:04] you exactly what you have need
[1:45:09] of he says and today's church is filled
[1:45:12] with mental believers who endorse the
[1:45:14] Virgin birth the shed blood going to
[1:45:17] church taking communion those are all
[1:45:20] great things
[1:45:23] he just described all of us I hope up
[1:45:25] until this
[1:45:26] point but then he says and are not
[1:45:30] reborn at
[1:45:32] all even so in that third age was the
[1:45:34] same problem human Faith wasn't enough
[1:45:37] then and it's not enough now it takes
[1:45:40] the very faith of the Son of God to drop
[1:45:43] into a man's heart so that he can
[1:45:45] receive the Lord Of Glory into the
[1:45:47] temple not made with hands
[1:45:51] he says it wasn't enough then and it's
[1:45:53] not enough now this was a living faith
[1:45:58] what Paul say I live by the
[1:46:00] faith he say in the Son of God he said
[1:46:05] of the Son of
[1:46:07] God he didn't say in he said of so these
[1:46:11] people weren't looking to their Church
[1:46:13] they weren't looking to man's
[1:46:15] ideas but God said you have not denied
[1:46:18] his faith my faith and they knew knew
[1:46:20] that it was only through his faith that
[1:46:22] they were saved only through his faith
[1:46:24] were they healed only in their in his
[1:46:26] faith could they be delivered as we come
[1:46:29] to this last slide now the musicians can
[1:46:35] come you can stand to your feet with me
[1:46:38] as we look at
[1:46:42] this the last part of that verse was
[1:46:45] about Antipas my faithful
[1:46:49] martyr
[1:46:52] brother brandham says there is no other
[1:46:54] record in the word or any profane
[1:46:57] history concerning this brother but
[1:47:00] surely there need not be it is more than
[1:47:03] enough that he was forn and known of the
[1:47:07] Lord he says full of the Holy Ghost and
[1:47:10] Faith as was Stephen he respected no one
[1:47:14] he feared no one and when death was
[1:47:16] pronounced upon all who would take that
[1:47:18] name and walk in the faith of Jesus
[1:47:20] Christ he took his stand with those who
[1:47:24] would not turn
[1:47:26] back like those in that age I say hold
[1:47:29] on to the faith lift up the name of
[1:47:32] Jesus manifest The Works of Christ and
[1:47:35] right now determine in yourself like
[1:47:37] Antipas I will not turn back I don't
[1:47:40] need people to know my name I don't care
[1:47:41] if anybody ever knows my name but let it
[1:47:43] be said that I held the faith that I
[1:47:45] lifted up the name of Jesus and that I
[1:47:47] never would turn back even like
[1:47:49] Tabernacle Don't Turn back we're too
[1:47:51] close to turn back now we're right at
[1:47:54] the blending of Time and Eternity they
[1:47:56] stood they made it every age has had an
[1:47:58] elect stand and make it I'm looking at a
[1:48:00] group that's going to stand and that's
[1:48:02] going to make it amen amen let's pray
[1:48:05] together Heavenly Father Lord how
[1:48:07] grateful we are Lord that it's your

[1:48:15] matter what anyone says no matter what

[1:48:29] Lord I pray that each one that's drifted
