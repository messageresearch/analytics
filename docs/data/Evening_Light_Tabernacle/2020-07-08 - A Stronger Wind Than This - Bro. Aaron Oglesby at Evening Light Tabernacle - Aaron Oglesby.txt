Lord we surrender the Lord the the gift that you gave us into your hand and we ask that you help us to move ourselves out of the way Lord loose my tongue and free my spirit Lord to speak how you would have me to speak Lord might I might not be bound by my own thoughts are bound by even notes or things that I've brought with me here Lord but may you have your way Lord speak to every heart tonight father we know Lord Jesus that when you're in the building miracles happen Lord God and we're expecting nothing less father than miracles because that's the kind of God we serve in Jesus name Amen if you have your Bibles with you if you will turn to second Corinthians four and the eighth verse we're gonna read there and then we'll read one verse from over in the book of Acts chapter 23 you know we've joked before that they make sure they give me a small bottle of water so i dont preach long and i come out this time and they gave me an empty one so I thought my goodness we bout to shut down amen second Corinthians four and verse eight says we were troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed Amen if you'll look with me in acts 23 verse 11 it says and the night following the Lord stood by him and said be of good cheer Paul for as thou has testified of me in Jerusalem so must thou bear witness also at Rome I prayed that God allowed his blessing to the reading of the word you may have your seats brother branham told us that God will always have somebody that will stand for him he taught us that he'll always have somebody that he can put his hand on somebody that will do his will somebody that will have a testimony in the I word that they live in and I know that the time we live in is getting more and more evil and it seems like sometimes you look around and more and more people are following away and there's fewer and fewer of us it seems however what we know beyond a shadow of a doubt is God is going to have somebody God is gonna have somebody that believes all of his word God is gonna have somebody that is completely surrendered to his will God is gonna have somebody that he can put his hand on for a testimony in this dark and evil age that we live in there's always been people down through the ages that were willing to believe parts of the word or were willing to surrender parts of themselves to him but he always had somebody that was totally surrendered somebody that was totally submitted and somebody that was willing to do the will of God brother Branham says I love that don't you love that God has never been without a witness God has always had a witness since the world began sometimes it come down to one man but God has always had somebody he could lay his finger on and say this is my servant in all ages and it's going to be the same way in this last stage that we're standing in now God's not going to get down to this last stage here at the closing of time and not have somebody that's going to stand up for his word he's not going to get down to the very end the very end of his plan and not have somebody in the palm of his hand that's willing to submit to him and do the will of the Father he's going to have somebody that will believe all the Word of God I believe for myself that this church stands for all of the Word of God I believe that this is a church that believes that all the promises God or true I believe that this is a church full of people that have experienced the highest of highs and yet many of us have experienced the lowest of lows and been through the darkest of valleys but through it all we know that God's Word is true through it all we remain anchored to the Rock of Ages through it all we remain anchor to the rough that is Jesus Christ brother Branham says my faith is stayed on the solid rock there's nothing can ever harm when you're anchored in that place the storms may shake and batteries but my anchor holds within the veil when a man or woman has anchored against that rock hallelujah there ain't nothing can ever shake you from it and tonight I want us to keep that in mind as we go through the things we discuss it doesn't matter what you're facing it doesn't matter where you're at tonight I'm telling you if you're standing on the rock you will not be moved I'm telling you if you're standing on the rock there's something that's still holding you I'm telling you if you're standing on the rock when the storm passes you're still gonna be standing there on the rock of ages' if you're standing on the rock tonight you have a sure foundation I believe that we are a people here anchored in Jesus Christ I believe that we're part of the people that have been seen in the vision and that's so important to us in this day I believe that we've been seen as overcomers I believe that when brother Branham saw the bride go up he saw you I believe that with all my heart I believed that I was a part of that I believed that you were a part of that when others went down you end up Church how comforting is that to know you say the world's going down it's okay I'm going up a little bit more every day the world's going down it's okay they've been seen going down but we've been seen going up and if we can see the world in that condition that what place does that put us at if we see them going down down down then even if you can't recognize that you have to know that at the exact same time there's are people going up and tonight I say take another step up take another step take another step closer get your eyes up the ones going down that's not us that's not who we are we don't have a part of that but we're going up tonight in Jesus name you said brother Aaron how do I know I was a part of that vision the devil tells me I'm not going to make it the devil tells me I was one of the ones that went down the devil tells me the devil tells me listen the devil is very good at his job and I don't if I'm gonna give him any credit I'll say that he's good at his job he's good at tearing you down he's good at lying - he's good at making you feel like you're a failure and you've come short quit listening to the devil we hear it over and over again and yet we continue to do it over and over again every one of our complexes every one of the things we deal with every fear we face is because we listen to the devil that's where they all came from and if I could get some of you not to hold on to the promises of God the way you hold on to the complexes if I could get you to hold on to the promises of God the way you hold on to the things that the devil is telling you you would be the most victorious person in this church tonight let's hold on to the right things you say how do I know the devil told me I'm not going to make it because the message called your name bear with me here and I realized that every person that hears this message isn't going to go I realize that but if the message called your name listen when I was in the chicken pen they told me I was a chicken but one day that Eagle screamed and I recognized it every one of those chickens heard the same thing I heard every one of those chickens heard that Eagle scream but it didn't mean nothing to them they just kept on pecking around doing what chickens do but I heard that Eagle scream and I said that's me something's calling me something said my name and something said your name when you heard this message there was a deep that called to the deep that was a vision of the bride whose name had been called by the message that's what that vision was it was a vision of the whose name had been called in a vision of the ones who had responded and stayed true to that message if the message calls your name tonight that means your your name was in the message think about that just for a minute if the message called your name if you heard your name in the message you couldn't hear it there unless your name was in the message how wonderful that is how powerful how much that stirs my soul it may not do nothing for you but to know that's the message of the I where my name was written there the message of the hour my name was there that devil wants to say you're a failure the devil says you do this you do that I just want to say my name's in the message devil my name is there my name is there and it's been there on the book of the last book of life since before the foundation of the world my name is there if you didn't have that seed gene of God you wouldn't have wanted it you wouldn't have responded to it but that evil scream identified you and therefore it places you in the vision a vision that told you you were going to rapture a vision that told you where you come from and where you're going a vision that said you're an overcomer a word to you personally listen I'm not telling you tonight that you're exactly where you need to be spiritually that's between you and God you know where you are but I'm telling you it's for you I'm telling you it called your name I'm telling you that you've been seen overcoming now it's up to you to step into the vision it's up to you to walk into the vision that's already been seen of you we have all been seen overcoming in this day and this is an important part might I remind you that the vision never failed Satan says you're not going to make it I say Satan there's never been a vision that failed God never sent a vision to the prophet of the hour that failed and if I've been seen in a vision going up I don't care what you do I don't what you say I don't care what wind blows I don't care what we have to go through I know that one of these days I'm going to step into that vision and in a moment in a twinkling of an eye these sails are going to begin to change everything about me is going to begin to change and I'm going to rapture because I've already been seen there and there's nothing he can do about it once it's already been seen it's already been seen in the mind of God he can't stop it get that through your head tonight he can't stop you from rapture and he can't defeat you he can't overcome you you've already been seen in God's month rapture at the end of this age you cannot be stopped and we're yet with that in mind Satan is a stubborn fellow he doesn't take kids to well he's been defeated time after time after time he was resisted in the Old Testament by those Saints and defeated he was defeated and whipped completely and stripped of his power at Calvary he was completely whipped there he was defeated time after time down through the church ages and as dark as it was he was defeated in the Dark Ages because there was always somebody that would stand and now here we are once again at the end of the age and he's been defeated time after time after time he has the worst losing record in the history of anybody ever and here we are again getting ready to hand him one more L here we are again that getting ready to hand it one more loss cause I'm telling you the bride of Jesus Christ is going to defeat him one more final time before we go in the rapture and it won't just be one little defeat it's like brother Timothy said the other day the word all what he's dealing with sicknesses he said somebody will be healed and delivered and overcome every single sickness that Satan has put on this earth every demon will be overcome every demon will be cast down every depression every anxiety every fear everything there is will be completely utterly and totally destroyed by the bride of Jesus Christ before we leave here I don't know where people get this idea that we're going to barely make it out by the skin of our teeth I don't know where people get this idea that we're just going to crawl in I'm telling you we're going to march out of here victorious with the enemy under our feet singing onward Christian soldiers going after war we are victorious we will be victorious we were victorious yesterday you were victorious today you're still standing you will be victorious tomorrow we will be victorious over the enemy and yet he's still determined he's determined in this last age more than ever to battle you to fight you to keep you from attaining your promises that's what we're preaching about tonight I forgot to say I always do a stronger win than this a stronger win than this Satan is going to challenge your church he challenged Jesus he challenged the Apostles he had challenged brother Branham and now here we are and he's challenging everything that we believe and he's challenging everything that we stand for and he's determined to shake him and his winds blow and his winds blow and he's determined one of these days those roots are going to let loose one of these days if I attack enough if my wins come enough if they swirl enough if they don't see him coming enough I'll break them and his wins below I believe the reason he is so angry Church is that in this scientific age that he is created in this age filled with more unbelief and more doubt than there has ever been on the face of the earth I believe he's so angry because they're still a people that believe I believe he's so angry that they're still a people believing and standing for the supernatural when we live in a world that thinks it's fairy tales when we live in a world that tells you it's not possible you live in a world that tells you if it can't be scientifically proven it's not the truth and there's still a people that ignore all that and something keeps holding them and they keep believing in the supernatural and they keep believing in the power of the third pool and they keep standing there regardless of what the devil sins and it incenses him and it makes him so angry because he has not been able to move you he has not been able to push you over and push you down like he did so many others he's angry that there's a people that stands for all the word and he's angry that there's still people holding on for their promises you mean after all these years he still believes he's going to be healed you mean after all these years he actually believes that that sun's gonna come back well absolutely I believe you dumb old devil because my God has never failed and all I see out of you is lies and all I see out of you as failures and all I see out of you as defeat why would I listen to anything you say yes I will be healed because it's in the word yes my sons coming home because it's in the word yes I'm gonna be delivered because it's in the word that's where I'm standing at that's my rock that's my anchor that's my foundation and he can't stand it and it makes him angry because his winds blew and his winds blow and it doesn't bother me none because I've got a sure foundation and I've got an anchor that holds tonight there's more doubt now than there's ever been and we are currently in an all-out assault on our faith jesus knew it was coming he said when I return will I find faith he knew where the attack would be every aspect of it is being tested every aspect of it's being challenged every aspect of it's being tried and I'm just telling you now if you're not there already the storms coming I'm just telling you if you're not there already the wind is coming and you better be anchored and you better be anchored on the solid rock you can't be anchored where you want to be anchored you can't be anchored on your ideas and you can't be anchored on Mama's ideas or even pastor's ideas and no matter how good those people may be you better be anchored in a solid revelation of who Jesus Christ is to you that he saved you and he's your savior and he gave you the baptism of the Holy Ghost you got to have your own anchor in this time because the storms are coming you better be built on the rock in these days because the devil is tacking in many different ways and means house we don't see it coming and he's trying to get us as a church yes as a worldwide body sure but I'm talking to you tonight as a church he's trying to get us to back up and he's trying to get us to back off with the things we claim to believe and he's trying to get us to back off we preached a third poole message full of power we've preached the third poole message that will change a life we have preached a message that will produce miracles we have preached a message that will cure cancer we have preached a message that will cure brain bleeds and he wants us to back up he wants us to back off of it and say well maybe it's just not like it used to be maybe we don't have the power that we you think we have or that used to be here when the Prophet was here I will not back off of one promise of God I will not back up for one minute for anything that I find in this Bible because it's mine it's mine to hold on to it will save me it will deliver me it will hold me it will keep me in the word says I will never be ashamed so it doesn't matter if I pray for a thousand and they all die tomorrow my gods are healer my god is a deliverer I will never be ashamed his promises are true they're yeah and they are amen he wants us to back up off of that he wants us to back up and settle for something just a little bit less charge has been welling up within me he started on Friday morning and the day after sister Karen's brain bleed brother Philip and I on several others were in Branson Missouri and we were in the hotel and brother Phillip was voicing his displeasure with the devil about his most recent attack on sister Karen and he said it feels like the devil is just trying to mock us because we've testified we've testified yet he comes back again look he'll do it that's what he does he's not just gonna go away well it didn't work once I guess I'll leave him alone now you can be healed today and attack again the same thing tomorrow but I knew what he was saying I was in agreeance with he said it feels like the devil is just trying to mock us right now trying to throw things up in our face and things that we just stood for and in that moment it kind of began to rise up in me he don't have enough then brother Timothy and brother Andrew Spencer and I began to talk about it at the cabin while brother ron was here he ain't got enough and I thought about how much Satan hates what we stand for how much he hates our testimonies how much he hates a lighthouse in the middle of darkness a lighthouse proclaiming our Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever a lighthouse proclaiming that our God heals a lighthouse proclaiming that our God delivers a lighthouse proclaiming that God still feels with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and there was something just rising up in me and it's been rising up and the more the storm blows the more it rises up within me if you think for a minute that I'm going to back up on preaching a living God if you think for one minute I'm going to back up on 3:00 on any of God's promises if you think for one minute we're going to back up on preach and divine healing if you think for one minute we're going to back up on preaching the baptism of the holy ghost if you think for one minute we're going to back up on preaching let the baptism of the Holy Ghost will save you and keep you from sin if you think for one minute that we're going to back up on those things if you think I'm going to quit preaching divine healing because you continue to strike down people I love with different sicknesses if you think you're going to get me to back up you've got another thing coming if you think we're gonna back up for one minute you've got another thing coming I want to proclaim to you into the whole world it'll take the stronger win than this to keep me from my promises it'll take a stronger wind this to get me to back up from every word of God he has given us in this day we're not backing up an inch as a strap it on the armor of God and we're going forward come more healing more deliberate more baptisms of the Holy Ghost more overcomers I'm not backing up I'm pushing through I'm walking forward it's gonna take a stronger win then this I'll tell you something personal right here many of you know that I've had some health issues since September 18th when the first attack came I've been tested for everything under the Sun they can't figure out exactly what it is and that's okay I don't have to know what John's name to kill him I don't really care dad doesn't matter to me Satan is defeated and I am having a complete healing but I had boys to my wife on Sunday or the week leading up to Sunday what was on my heart throughout the week how Satan wasn't enough and how they take a stronger win than this and how his wins would never move me never move us and we were grounded on the solid rock brother Timothy began to go down a certain line Sunday that just really confirmed to me what I was to speak on tonight and I was extremely overjoyed when he began to go down that line and really it put a lot of confidence in my heart and it was just an awesome moment in the sermon and I was excited because it confirmed to me that I was in the right channel for tonight's service I even looked back where my wife was and she didn't hurt and I smiled at her and she smiled at me real big just one of those things you know and no more than God had confirmed to me the devil came right there in that chair with fear and I'll tell you what he said he said don't you think I have stronger winds to send don't you think I have stronger winds once again let me say King we will not bow let your fury rage heat the furnace seven times hotter let your strong men bind me whatever but we're not gonna bend we're not gonna bow we're not gonna give in to your fear tackett's we're not backing up you can take me up to the fiery furnace that's fine my god is willing and my god is able to deliver what you can't see is that big bad fiery furnace may look scary but there's a fourth man on the way from me there's a fourth man in the fire from me there's a fourth man here tonight and he's fighting your battles and he's overcoming your fears and he's casting out the devil out of your life say ten it'll take a stronger win than this because even like Tabernacle is not backing up we have set our sons our sights on the goal we know where we're going we know what we've come through we know what you carry this through and you're not gonna stop us now some of us have been through the hardest heartaches we can go through but guess what stage it we're still here you told some of us we'd be gone 15 years ago ten years ago five years ago say ten we're still here and we're not going anywhere until the Lord calls us home we're not backing up or taking a step back until he takes us in a rapture whether Brown says when you see the real true principles of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ when you see our foundation is sure and solid all Devils out of hell can't upset the foundation of God upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell can't prevail against it it'll be against it sure will but it will never prevail God's foundation stands sure Amen now many times Satan's wind can come in many different forms I'm gonna go through some of this quickly just because we all deal with winds in a different way we have different attacks so my attacks not the same as the attack you may face many times it may come in the form of sickness maybe a form of depression or something like that and when that comes we must be sure to understand as Christians that those things come from the devil get that right now clear set in stone sickness is of the devil depression is of the devil those things are not from Almighty God many times we want to place it on God and we think we're being punished for some shortcoming or some failure and as long as we're thinking that way those winds will blow us all over the place those winds will move us in every direction and we won't be able to stand firm but brother Branham said let's take the profit job now that man went through a test but he knowed that God required a burnt offering that's what God required and that's all he required and no matter how much disaster happened to his home when you see something going wrong for a fellow that don't mean that he's being whipped by God it might not be that he's out of the will of God he knows in his heart whether he's listening to the trumpet or not God required to burn offering and Jobe stood right on it that's all they said Jobe you're a secret sinner you're doing something that's wrong but he knowed better he says he knowed it was the devil and as long as Satan can make him believe that his sickness was his God doing it he had Jobe whipped but when Joe once struck that revelation that it was not God he was only going through trial to make him something it wasn't God doing it it was Satan doing it listen when you realize it's the enemy doing it when you realize who it is you can stand right there on the Word of God and defeat the enemy but as long as you think it's coming from God you can't have big confidence in his word and you can't get to the place where you realize that you've been justified and sanctified by his sacrifice you can't see past your faults and you can't see past your failures and you're seeing everything through through a glass you're seeing everything through a filter of your failures and your faults and the devil will completely defeat you right there but when you realize that the price has been paid when you realize that this is not God's punishment when you realize that this sickness has already been defeated that's when you can begin to come out of the thing he says it doesn't make you an unbeliever when things befall you the devil will the devil will hold that over people and he'll make them believe that they've done something wrong and he'll begin to accuse you brother Brown says cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval cloudy skies and storms of life are no sign of God's disapproval listen we absolutely do believe in the law of sowing and reaping we understand that we understand that sometimes our disobedience or maybe our stubbornness can lead to a situation or even an affliction that God can use to bring us back to where he warned us to begin with he can use these things to make us lean more on him to trust him more there are things you can learn through affliction absolutely all right but make no mistake about it trials come to everyman and sickness attacks every home and we must move beyond the thought that this is a punishment from God we must move beyond the thought that that were sick because of something that we did in our past we must move beyond the Putt thought that this sickness is there for us to show our humility for us to suffer with the Lord or for us to show patience brother Brown said that people teach that to excuse their unbelief he said people teach those things to it excuse their unbelief instead we must preach a resurrected Lord we must preach a Jesus Christ that saves we must preach a Jesus Christ that heals we must preach that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever who will do the miraculous for you in the moment where it seems impossible it's the third pool anointing it's the Eagle anointing right when you think you're going down it will snatch you up out of the flames it will snatch you out of this generation it'll snatch you out of the sickness it'll snap you out of whatever position the devil has placed you in because it's not from God [Music] it's nonsense that we have to suffer for Glatt God's glory sometimes these winds will come through people I would hang it up like these other guys who did just be all out in the floor anyways sometimes people are so quick to play the role of jobs comforters ultimate so quick to place the blame of someone's situation on the person that's going through the situation so quick to point fingers wondering and even voicing this maybe there was some secret sinning that had been going on or sins that have been committed but you must be careful when you get to this place I find that odd how so many times we're more concerned with other people's sins than we are our own but we must be careful when we get to this place because when you begin to accuse someone especially a Christian what you're doing is you're placing yourself on this side of the accuser of the Brethren and that's not the side that you want to be standing that's the defeated side that's the losing side that's the cast down side it's our job to lend a helping hand a hand to support a hand of Prayer to lift the person up not to point a finger at them the Bible tells us in Romans 8:33 who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justified so we want to be careful when someone's going through these things if anything we should have learned from Jobe that the people that suffer that suffers the most aren't always the ones who sin the most that's something that you can take away took that but even the Apostles would ask this question when they came upon the blind man they said whose sin caused this man to be blind Jesus answers in John nine and three neither hath this man sinned nor his parents but that the works of God should be made manifest in him the works of God made manifest in him listen the sickness did not bring any glory to God that's where we get confused the sickness brought no glory to God the sickness didn't manifest God's glory the healing brought glory to God it was the victory that brought glory to God it was the overcoming that brought glory to God the glory comes when the giant head is taken off that's like saying we got to sit here and listen to glass for 40 days to bring glory to God that makes zero sense the glory comes in the victory the glory comes in the healing listen you will bring no glory to God in your suffering but you will bring glory to God in your victory you will bring glory to God and your deliverance you will bring glory to God when that sickness is under your feet and many times they don't take other people to play that role sometimes people play the accuser of themselves themselves well this is happening because God's punishing me because I've displeased God listen quit talking the devil's language quit speaking his language rise up and speak the words of God rise up and say what the word says Jesus paid the price my past is forgiven my sins are washed away by His stripes I'm healed quit speaking the devil's language and began to speak the language of victory he has no right to my mind he has no right to my body there is no reason that I should be going through this other than the fact that he's the devil he is a tormentor and I rebuke him in the name of Jesus Christ by His stripes I am healed don't allow the wind of the enemy to back you off who you are don't allow the words of the enemy to back you up for a minute off of what the word says you are the word says you're a son of God the word says you're justified and sanctified so don't listen to him saying you messed up you did this wrong maybe I did in my past life but that's not who I am because I've come through the blood I've come through the sanctification and the justification I've been there I've been under the sacrifice and because of that I can stand on the rock tonight and your wind will not move me that's one thing his wins are no match for our anchor when you're standing on the rock you can stand in confidence brother Branham says but if you really base your faith on God's eternal Word and it's down in your heart all devils if you'll notice every quote I read tonight I'll have the word all Devils in it all Devils out of torment can't upset you no sir you've got to stay there I know what I speak of because I've seen it and I put it to the test myself and I know that it's true see God's Word is eternal and unchanging but that doesn't matter if your faith isn't anchored in it his word is eternal and unchanging and that our faith in that unchanging word must be sure and steadfast but along the way Satan brings every type of unbelief and every kind of doctrine that there is to move you off of your god-given property to move you all for your promises brother Branham would call these doctrines and these things Giants he would refer to him over and over again as Giants and he says I don't care how much reasoning how much reasoning in it if it's against God's Word it's against God's Word if an intellectual giant come said we don't need no Holy Ghost we don't need this divine healing I don't care how much reasonable it looks like if it's contrary to the word God gave the promise amen they say that was just for the apostles I wonder where they get that Peter said on the day of Pentecost repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you and under your children and to them that's far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call amen just for the apostles brother Branham says for every one that's called yet don't listen to that giant don't listen to that giant listen if you're a person here tonight younger old and you've been wanting the baptism of the Holy Ghost I am a witness that it is still available for you the Word of God is witness enough but just this past week I've seen three men filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost in an instant filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost in an instant it happened just like that he's still here to give it to you he's just waiting on you to come and ask for it and accept it and receive it don't be listening to no intellectual John turn you don't need it no more all you got to do is believe God sent a prophet all you got to do is accept this to accept that no you got to be born again just like everybody else down through the ages and it's still available he's still doing it to this day but now more than ever the supernatural is doubted the supernatural is being questioned and when I say these things I'm not talking about in denominational churches I'm not talking about out on the street the supernatural is being pushed out the Holy Ghost divine healing deliverances miracles God don't do those things no more brother Branham said I wonder where they get that I wonder where they get that listen we can't get all the way down here to the closing of time the closing of all ages and make the same mistake that all generations and other ages behind us made we can't get all the way down here and go backwards by making the same mistake that the Pentecostal denominations made by getting off on a ditch somewhere and hunkering down on a truth and yet leaving the other side of truth out of it in other words Pentecost error was never was accepting the gifts and the supernatural that was not their error Casas error is that they only accepted that their error was that they accepted the gifts they accepted the supernatural but they did not accept the fullness of the word that's the error of Pentecost and we would find ourselves in that exact same error if we were to say that we accept the word we accept the fullness of the word and yet we denied the gifts and the supernatural that the word itself declares should be there you will find yourself in the exact same place but just on the other side of the road in a ditch period or cross the road at the other people that have stumbled in the ditch along the way it's the same error just reversed okay because you say we've got the word and those things your reminder that's fine you can call them what you want I don't find them minor I need divine healing I need those things but you can call them that if you want to the fact of the matter is you can't have the major unless all the minors are there you can't have the fullness of the word and leave out the baptism of the Holy Ghost leave out the supernatural leave out the gifts leave out the healings you can't leave those things out and claim to be standing in the fullness of the word however that's exactly where we find many people that today we find ourselves in a time where the supernatural is under attack we find ourselves in a time where it's looked down upon and have people shouting and dancing in the church words look down upon to have tongues in interpretation they say having dreams and vision in the church takes away from the profit it takes away from the profit for there to be dreams and visions in the church actually it takes away from scripture further not to be okay because in Joel 2:28 it says it shall come to pass afterward that I will pull out my spirit pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions so there's that it's right there in the scripture how can it take away if you're fulfilling Scripture it cannot take away when it's fulfilling Scripture we're living in a time where message churches are teaching that you can have the Holy Ghost and still commit any manner of sin we're in a time where people teach just accept God sent a prophet and you got it here's what these things are winds the winds of the enemy blowing it was in this age at the beginning of the 1900s that God began a move of restoring the gifts and he began once again to manifest himself through through gifts and through the spirit and although that we know this wasn't the full restoration or the the fullness of restoration we know this was the life passing through we know that this began to prepare a people for the supernatural it was a softening rain that would prepare the ground for a supernatural message to come and then that message came and it took us back to the original it took us back to Pentecost it took us back to the rock that is Jesus Christ it wasn't a partial word but it was a full word restoration and in that word is correct doctrine in that word is gifts of the Spirit in that word is divine healing in that word is the baptism of the Holy Ghost in that word is deliverance in that word is everything you have need of so take all of the word don't take parts of it don't try to return us back to some dried formal denominationalism that's not what's gonna rapture us out of here take the whole word eat the book let it become you let it lift through you let the power of God manifest itself and demonstrate itself through your life once again we are a people of the book as we have heard his brother Tim has preached restored to a land of promise but the winds of the enemy are blowing through the camp church and unfortunately it's coming out from Mahon message pulpits and it's trying to rob the word of its power and it doesn't want the supernatural operating in it brother Branham says this you say yes coming out from message pulpit so those are brothers those are but listen to this Joseph being a type of Christ born to be a seer he saw visions he was hated of his brothers loved of his father he couldn't help because he saw visions he was a spiritual boy God made him that way and the father loved him but his brothers hated him a type of the church today the carnal thinking Christian hates the spiritual things hates the phenomenal hates the spiritually borned again hates the move of God hate it without a cause that's right don't unchristian eyes them but they hate always the natural hates the supernatural amen he says and the only reason they hated him because he was spiritual he saw visions and can interpret dreams and his brethren they were good fundamental people but they just couldn't see the supernatural side I have the hardest time just as a human understanding claiming to believe a message that was so supernatural signs and miracles start-to-finish signs and miracles start to finish knowing the berry theme of that message was Hebrews 13:8 Church the theme of the message Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and to stand and then and claim that message a supernatural message it was supernatural signs proclaiming that Jesus does not change and then begin to drift from that to God don't do those things anymore I've said it before sometimes you wonder if people are on the same page but then sometimes you wonder if they're in the same book are we reading and believing in experiencing the same things are we even standing for the same things God doesn't do those things anymore it's the exact same giant that brother Branham faced night after night after night after night as this message began to spread across the world and night after night in the face of skepticism he was willing to stand I believe were willing to stand the winds didn't shake him because he had been commissioned I believe even like Tabernacle we've been commissioned the winds didn't shake him because he had a word from the Lord and night after night he would go out there in the face of skeptics in the face of unbelievers in the face of people that wanted him to fail and shut the mouths of the skeptics because time after time after time God would come and back up his word time after time he would come down and prove I am the same as I was yesterday I do those miracles I do heal I do deliver I do set the captive free every single night brother Brown says in here he when he's talking about David just a dancing in the spirit as hard as he could why my faith he saw the victory amen he saw the victory he took his little old sling in there and one of these stones and he give it a dance and here he comes coming around oh I see Goliath saying hohoho what was it he had five stones f8i eh in five fingers wrapped around his string around j esus here he comes oh brother look out Goliath you've got to fall and when he set that loose the Holy Ghost got ahold of that little old stone and he picked it up to a speed of about a thousand miles per second and he struck that giant between the face and he fell forward hallelujah oh my and like a little Jim Crow he danced up there he jumped up on him he pulled his sword out he chopped his head off like that and he said how do you like that boy I like that I'm not sure if that's exactly what David said but that's where I'm gonna go with I like it it's time some of us get out there and we let our joy be known some of us going into the battle like this but he said he danced his way out there he said he did a little dance and he went to running and when he let it go I believe he believed in the power of the Holy Ghost because I said the Holy Ghost took that stone and it got to going a thousand feet per second and he said Goliath you've got a fall and I declare today jeanny devil of tale that we're trying to bind the movement of the spirit that would try to bind the baptism of the Holy Ghost healings in the name of Jesus deliverance in the church you've got a fall tonight you can't stand because we're not going to let you stand we're coming out to meet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he says he pulled out his sword and cut off his head and said how do you like that boy reach down and got him by the hair of his head said come on boys let's preach divine healing whoa I like that hey look bad said come on was who was he talking to the ones who were too scared to preach it the ones who had stayed in their tents the ones who wouldn't meet the challenge but he didn't forget them like brother Bradley didn't creep D Christianizing he turn around - come on boys you can preach it - you can have to promise - let's preach the bond healing and he says a way they went hallelujah and you know what they done the rest of them seen it could be done and they cut Philistines palm to the wall glory down there the old critics has got to shut their mouths well if you didn't like that you got a problem with the prophet not me he said the old critics has got to shut their mouths now what did they see they saw somebody who was willing to stand they saw somebody who the winds of Gilad slides and his doctrines didn't move down they saw somebody who said this wind will not move me I will preach healing in the face of sickness I will preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the face of intellectualism and a way they went because somebody was willing to stand even in light Tamra knock well I know these men on the platform are willing to stand and I believe he Chand every one of you are willing to stand and say these doctrines will not move me this wind will not move me we believe in the power of the Holy Ghost we believe in the moving of the Spirit we believe in miracles and signs and wonders because it's in the word we're going to stand on it and we will have them like David I'm not meaning to criticize I'm saying brother quit listening to that giant that says you can't have it because you can have it I'm saying square up your shoulders tonight I'm saying quit listening to the intellectual Giants drive back your wins of doubt quit making excuses for why you don't have the supernatural and come on down here in the valley where we're fighting that come on down here and get you a piece of this right here because once you get a taste of it there's no going back once you get a taste of killing a Philistine there's no going back once you've seen one person set free you're not going to say he don't do that no more you're gonna love seeing the power of God move and you're gonna say he can do it for that one he'll do it for this one he did it for your house he'll do it from my house he did it for your house he'll come to my house get yourself a taste of it come down in the valley one time and realize you can do the greater works we need the day of old-fashioned God sent st. Paul's revival on the Bible Holy Ghost then a lot of this old ticker Chalker halfway formal religion broke up and Jesus Christ needs to be preached in the power of his resurrection where signs and wonders and miracles can take place again in the church before the end time it's the best part and we are going to have it you get that all devil out of hell can't stop it for God said it would be here it's going to be here sure is the wind wants us to back off the supernatural but I hear a prophet saying we can have it I hear a prophet saying all Devils in Hell can't stop us from having it I hear it proper to say it'll be here and I say Lord be it unto me let it be here in my life let it be here in your life let it be in your home let it be in our church services I'm not backing up I will have it he's trying to get you to back up it sure is a strong wind it blows hard but the scripture said we're troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair we are persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed it's going to take a stronger wind than this I believe that we're a people willing to look beyond what we see of people that still believe in the miraculous 1/3 pool people willing to look into the supernatural Satan does not want you to recognize the supernatural he doesn't want you to see that Jesus is the same today because there's something that happens to you as an individual once you contact the supernatural once you realize that it's operating in your myths and it's something that you can't be shook from but the brown was in a prayer line and there's a girl there in a wheelchair and he goes through several amazing discernments where he's dealing with people and and I'm not gonna read them because they're long but they're just incredible so detailed and one lady gets her hearing back and then another brother receives his healing after this long discernment and brother Branham says and I turned around and I was I did I seen that crippled girl sitting in that chair just as plain as I'm looking at this gentleman gentleman sitting here rise up out of that chair rise up out of that chair only she was dressed different than what she was sitting there and she went walking down the aisle it looked like just the waving her hands like that and saying thank God thank God watched her till it faded out and I turned back around I said sister dear and he says old friends you'll never know how it feels to know when you know where you're standing there's nothing all demons out of torment can't stop it then no sir I've seen when doctors were standing at the bed and say he can't come in that's fanaticism well we can't let that in here I said well you step aside and just watch the patient for a few minutes mom when you watch them perfectly normal in just a few minutes it's never failed God is my judge and I looked at that little girl I said sister Jesus Christ the Son of God has heard your prayers and healed you stand in your feet no nowhere she never made it to brother Brandon he turns and he points her and he says your prayers has healed you stand on your feet and that girl hadn't walked since she was eight years old and up she got out of that wheelchair and there she stood brother Richie you were standing there there she went through the building glorifying God they moved the wheelchair back the glory of God swept over the building everywhere and the people begin to rise and throw their crutches and canes and walking what is it that doesn't heal people to tell you what's wrong with you now listen here's why Satan wants to keep you away from it to keep you from recognizing it's in our midst he said that doesn't heal you to tell you what's wrong with you but here's what it does friends it brings the realization of the supernatural God working in our midst just exactly Satan doesn't want you to recognize there still a supernatural God here in our midst because even the realization that he's here there the revelation that he's in the service the recognition that I can go free right now when you get that revelation that he's here the King of Kings is in this building right now he's right next to me and he wants to meet my name and he's still supernatural and he can heal me he can save me he can bring my loved one in tonight when you get that revelation it's over it's finished and he knows he's got to keep you from recognizing that so he said God don't do that no more I'm here to say it's a lie it's a lie he does it he still does it he doesn't service after service after service he moves it home as a home after home and we got many standing up across this place and say he still does the miraculous but he don't want you to grasp it because it builds your faith it lifts you up see the body change is supernatural we can't be looking to a body change and looking away from the miraculous at the same time if God don't move like that now then there is nobody change because it's going to take faith and it's going to take the miraculous and if he doesn't do the miraculous anymore we're not going anywhere I would tend to classify the rapture as a pretty big miracle that's just me I tend to classify that as miraculous so God must still do the miraculous he must still move in that way and so Satan constantly attacks the supernatural but there is somebody God's always got somebody there is somebody that's gonna stand for it there is somebody who's going to say he's the same yesterday today and forever listen this message came with power and demonstration this message came healing all manner of sickness it came delivering all kinds of demonic oppression it came in power and demonstration it started with the divine healing moving and now here we are in the midst of a world bound by sickness think about that for just a second the entire world bound by sickness on the hills of God sin and divine healing moving in that came out of that and Satan's trying to mock you she'll believe in divine heal I've shut this whole world down with sickness with with a little virus I've shut the world and you believe in the supernatural you believe in the power of God to heal any monks and he mocks the power of God and he's determined to mock you and mock his power and what he can do and what you say you believe but what I want to ask you right now is what is your ear tuned to is your ear tuned to the sickness or is it tuned to the supernatural is your ear tuned to the word or is your ear tuned to the doctor that told brother Ron he only had four months to live by the way we've passed that point as a matter of fact he ran out of all his his chemo medications is that is that right I heard I was told he run out of his chemo medications because they only gave him three months worth so when he reapplied for his grant to get more they said well the reason we only gave you three months worth is because nobody ever lives past that point as our I ear tuned to the sickness or is it tuned to the supernatural is our ear tuned to the sickness is our ear tuned to the doctor tell him brother Joe sister Karen may live five more minutes or is it tuned to the fact that today she got up and walked to the sink and brushed your teeth what's it to - is your ear tuned to the doctor's report that told brother Tim prepare for death do you even want us to attempt this surgery or is it tuned to the fact that she's sitting up for hours at a time and joking and laughing and telling them I want to get out of here what is your ear tuned to because that's what you will see what your eyes own is what you're going to see what you're listening to is what you're going to see and I'm tell you the miraculous is all around you Church you have been blessed the pillar of fire is amongst us the miraculous has taken place every day there's healing sweeping through this building even now as faith begins to rise up and realize that he's moving in our midst the realization taking place that he's here tonight there's a realization taking place that I can be free that this is lives of the enemy the wins and the enemy will not move me it's gonna take you're stronger when did this I'm gonna stand on his word I'm gonna preach his gospel he is the same he has not changed his word is as powerful today as it ever was and you can go free right now the supernatural is happening all around us even as we speak up and down these halls in the hospital room oh brother Ron cries out from Virginia it's gonna take the stronger wind in this sister Karen crawls out from a hospital room it's going to take much stronger win than this and I think everybody that's been attacked by the winds and storms of I can shout out it's gonna take a stronger wind than this to move me off my promises tonight hallelujah it's gonna take a stronger win than this what is your ear tuned to tonight I'm gonna bring this down when the storms come and like I said they're coming you better know where you're standing where do you stand when sickness strikes what are you staying when others walk away what do you stand when the bills are piled up and you need a job is it on the promise is it on the word cuz listen the winds are blowing but he's a sure foundation mother brown says a fire foundation is firm and sure in Jesus Christ and brother there's nothing can shake you you're anchored amen oh say all right if a man wants anchors is hard against the heart of Calvary all Devils in Hell will shake him no more he's there he says I've done enough to die in an hour I'm a sinner to begin with but looking who give me the promise I'm looking who said so don't you fear stand there for this cause you were born I raised you up for this purpose then all Devils in hell can't make me move I'm standing there on Christ that solid rock he says well now aren't you happy tonight that you're baptized into the Church of the firstborn of the Living God that the very same spirit that was in Christ is in the church tonight and you're a part of it by the Holy Ghost being dead in Christ take on Abraham's seed and their heirs according to the promise what are we scared about all Devil's inhale couldn't shake you there's nothing can shake you we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved what I keep hearing is he doesn't have enough Satan doesn't have enough he keeps saying all devils oh that means every last one he's got all Devils can't shake you all Devils can't move him if all Devils can't stop you and if all Devils can't shake you then it means he doesn't have enough to defeat you in it doesn't matter if you're a new Christian you say I just got saved I hadn't even been saved long David was in the army five minutes before he killed Goliath he just signed up five minutes and he killed Goliath firm his foundation was firm you say I'm a failure I felt Christ all the time it doesn't matter if you're a Christian that's fill time after time after time and you've allowed the enemy to come in time after time and rob you again and again they rob Shamgar every single year Shamgar sambhar got in the bible for being a hero being a judge and he was a failure most of his life to the point that the the Philistines knew that's an easy place to go get stuff that's an easy place to rob a victory that home right there I can bring anxiety anytime I want I can bring depression there anytime I want I can stir that family up so quick we can go there in a heartbeat and steal their joy we can show up there Shamgar was a failure every single year but not this day not this day brother Branham says this is one of my favorite quotes I love this quote about Shamgar he says Shamgar said I'm sick and tired of there's any of you sick and tired of the winds of the enemy tonight let this be you tonight he says I'm not a warrior the odds is against me no matter how much the odds is against you though God's for you if you take his word he said there's one thing I know I'm circumcised I'm an Israelite that is an uncircumcised philistine I know I'm right I'm a child of God tonight and I know disease comes from the devil and I know God promised me victory whoa brother I wish you felt like I felt right now yes sir I feel awfully good look it's my god-given privilege yes sir I'm still tonight in America where I can preach it I can enjoy it thanks to the Lord for it he said his righteous Ignat day evening nation rose he grabbed that ox go he jumped through the window he challenged six hundred Philistines he stood there and beat their heads in I'm gonna read that part again because I like it he stood there and beat their heads in why not a warrior not at all but he was an Israelite he was circumcised and then tonight if you're circumcised with the Holy Ghost you don't have to wait till you're trained to be a warrior god bless your heart claim your god-given privilege and be their heads in amen that's right say get out of my way Satan kick him out the way I'm the god that's taking over now oh I like that beat his head in and then tell him I'm the god that's taking over now I come in Jesus name watch him scatter brother when you use that faith on him he will back up what was different that day it was a day of Revelation what was different that day it was a day that he remembered who he was these are my promises this is my healing I'm a seed of Abraham he's an uncircumcised philistine he remembered who he was in that moment and tonight can be your awakening you can come to the remembrance of Who I am I'm a son of God I'm blood ball I'm blood washed and that devil was on my property and when the awakening comes and your revelation is sure all Devils in hell can't move you all devil 600 600 it went from oh no here comes 600 Philistines again I look to the only sent 600 what happened it went from that to what I think I'm some got a joke they only sent 600 and he grabs his ox coat it out the window he goes and he kicks and he fought and he screamed and he bashed Devils heads in was it a battle sure it was a battle was it easier probably wasn't real easy but when the killing was done Chambord looked around and said ain't send enough when the killing was done Shambo looked around and said it's going to take a stronger win than this for me the effort back off my promises ever again it's gonna take a stronger winning this for me to ever let my family go hungry again I'll never let him Rob my prayer life again I'll never let him Rob the joy out of my home again I'll never let him do it they didn't send enough and it's going to take a stronger wind than this to keep me off those promises it's the same mistake he's always made Church he didn't send enough when he sent bill I he didn't send enough when he threw him in the lion's den he didn't send enough when they came through the Red Sea he didn't send enough when the three Hebrew children came to the fiery furnace he didn't have enough that day on Calvary he didn't have enough there at the Nicean council he didn't have enough when they tried to bullet out of John he didn't have enough down through the dark ages somebody always stood in the face of certain death he didn't have enough to stop the message from going forth in this day and he doesn't have enough now there's not enough cancers there's not enough brain bleeds there's not enough Cove is there's not enough demons in hell there's not enough depression there's not enough autoimmune disease there's not enough of anything in hell to make me back up I'm telling you safety you don't have enough it's gonna take a stronger wind than this to get me to back up it's gonna take a stronger wind than this to get even like tavern I put a bow down because we ain't gonna do it we are not gonna move he is the same yesterday today and forever he is my healer he is my liver he is brother wrong Tina he is sister Karen Taylor he's your healer tonight and he can deliver you even now I know I gotta close I didn't even get to it I didn't even get to our one go but I'm not gonna tell you about it for a second we're talking about a stronger wind no wonder Satan hates God so much how infuriating it must be to give your all every single day and never be enough that's gotta be pretty frustrating but I gave it my all and you failed again sorry I gave everything I had yeah same as yesterday now go ahead let you know it's that's what's gonna happen tomorrow he must be so infuriated because God on the other hand is always enough what a contrast Satan is never enough and yet God is always enough and that's why we've been taught to look to the unseen because Satan's winds stir up things up to these eyes look instrumental amount of the Red Sea looked insurmountable the Lions Den looked insurmountable the Assyrians looked insurmountable until other days I could see into the other realm then you realize they ain't got enough it's not way more than them they don't have enough should've brought more oh that's all you got y'all come back later on I'll be here all week I'm not going anywhere that's the message I want to get to the devil or not we're not going anywhere we're not running we're leaving one day but it's not because you told us to we're leaving one day but it's when we'd conquered you we're leaving one day but is when all hail is under our feet but until then he's more than enough to keep us in this world he's more than enough to protect us he's more than enough and seeing this world the winds come and they said that they they scare us but brother branham said that that round is more real than this round that realm is more real than this round and so what I'm telling you is that in this realm Satan's wind seems scary in this round the situation looks bleak but in the rounds of the supernatural the rounds that matter the most is the enemy that's afraid of the winds because there is a stronger wind there is a greater wind but let me tell you something church that's on our side it's not coming against us it's the wind of the Holy Ghost it's stronger than any wind Satan's God it's stronger than anything listen there has never been once that a devil has been hit by the power of the wind of the Holy Ghost that he stood up and said it's going to take a stronger wind than this matter of fact when the Holy Ghost gets ahold of them they don't say nothing they are defeated they are shut up they are cast out they are destroyed they are run out forever because they don't have any power against this win Satan says looks like trouble water up ahead and Satan troubles the water and God just makes her way through Satan says looks like trouble water up ahead and that water just draws us closer to God what can his wind do that peace be still won't stop what can his wind really do in your life Satan troubles the water and Jesus just comes walking on it but listen with my Jesus troubles the water whew no demon can walk on that water when his wind begins to blow and the waters are troubled like they are here tonight demons are scattered the hinges of hell are shook enemies are defeated people are set free lose the thickness he'll when my god wind begins to blow and the waters begin trouble with his presence no demon of hell can stand against them I feel a change in the wind coming tonight Church there's a change in the wind coming the winds of hell all around the Israelites during the Red Sea and the winds were blowing it seemed like certain death but there was a change in the winds about to come I see one of them old dad standing there with his children and I think he probably heard it go by he said there's a change in the wind children there's a change in the wind and the wind beginning to blow the Bible says Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the Lord caused the sea to go backed by a strong east wind all that night and made the sea dry land and the waters were divided go to chapter 15 thou just blow with my wind and the sea covered them and they st. has led in the mighty waters there was a change in the wind that begin to come there's a change in the winds in the world we're living in because there's a wind coming to destroy the enemy there's a wind coming to lift us up there was a wind that changed one day in the hunt for room when there were a hundred and twenty people gathered there and down in hell can you imagine the social unrest that was going on in the world at that time there had to be fear than Jesus has been crucified they'd seen him raised up and they knew all that at the same time the government's in my next to be arrested in my next what's going on who's against us who's for us what's going on and down in hell Satan was sitting there with all his devils and they thought they were triumphant they thought they had won and all of a sudden that Devon the quarter said Oh what is it there's been a change in the winds the winds in the upper room had begin to blow and a sound from heaven came down like a rushing mighty wind and I'm telling you from that day forward his winds do not matter anymore there's only one wind that bothers us or that we know that we know - it's the wind of the Lord Jesus Christ as he sweeps through this place he'll try wind at the enemy he'll drive out the precious he'll drive out the winds that torment you his wins ain't got enough when it comes up against the wind but the Holy Ghost I'll say Lord Jesus let it blow the night let it pour down in my soul let it sweep through this building Lord let your winds blow all over me because I know you're the same I know you heal I know you delivered I know you do the miraculous we are a third pull people and we are going in a rapture because we believe in a miraculous God on a literally understanding your feet with me and give God praise you know blessed be the name of the Lord [Applause] why can you say the winning in the movie well we established at the beginning that she was part of a vision once you've been seen in the vision and you've received her word from the Lord Paul was told he was going to wrong shipwreck didn't matter it says they sailed under stormy winds I didn't matter brother branham had a vision of the little boy in Finland years before it happened and when he came to that moment I didn't get to it but he tells everybody he says you can inline every devil inhale up and they couldn't stop it now Paul was going to Rome because he'd been seen that boy was gonna raise up had been seen you're going in a rapture it's been seen you can line up all the devil's inhale tonight it's going to take a stronger wind than this to keep us from our promise let's pray gracious father how we love you Lord Lord how thankful we are father for your promises Lord how thankful you are Lord that once it's been spoken Lord once it's been seen you're an unchanging unfailing God though we can rest everything we all are in your hands we can trust you Lord and know that you're going
