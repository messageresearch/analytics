TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I got a lot of spots. Well, you got a spotless sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he might present us spotless. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he might pre present us spotless. It's not me making sure I got everything crossed. Listen, Pharisees had that done. They would do the right times and the right prayers and the right this and the right that. Wouldn't touch this, wouldn't touch that, would stone somebody for doing it. &gt;&gt; Had it all figured out. But that wasn't the rest that Jesus wanted. &gt;&gt; That wasn't the blood Jesus really wanted or God required. It was the blood of a perfect sacrifice that he that sacrifice can present us spotless. Amen. He said, see, you can see in the Old Testament type, let us go back to the Garden of Eden and the first news came from glory that the son Adam had been lost. Did God send an angel? Did he send a son? Did he send an unlike? No. No. He came himself to redeem that lost son. God did not entrust his plan of salvation to another. He trusted only himself. God was made flesh and dwelt among us and redeemed us unto himself and were saved by the blood of God. The eternal God and dwelt a mortal body in order to take away sin. He became the lamb in order to shed his blood and enter into the veil with it. Consider this. Since it was the blood of God, it is a perfect blood. And if it's a perfect blood that has loosed us from power and bondage and defilement of sin, then the loosen is perfect and complete. There is now therefore no condemnation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, if somebody's laying something to your charge, I can tell you who it is. It's Satan. &gt;&gt; Cuz once that sin has been dipped under the blood of Jesus Christ, it's remembered no more. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I got a lot dipped down in there. &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful I ain't got to go before him every day and wonder if he still remembers when I did this wrong. And when it still remembers when I No, I can boldly go before the throne of grace cuz I'm not coming in on my own marriage, my own abilities. He is presenting me spotless. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect? Well, I can tell you, you know, you did this wrong and you did that and condemnation, condemnation, condemn this, condemn that. That's the devil. &gt;&gt; Quit listening to his voice. &gt;&gt; Now, it's from God and you did wrong and it convicts your heart. Make it right. &gt;&gt; Just like brother Brandham talked about that woman. You know, I think brother John Andy's did a little demonstration in our camp about that woman that was standing in line. I think it was a woman, right? Anyway, had something going on in her life and he said, "If you've done such and such such, he said, "Step back out. Step out of the line. Make it right. Ask God to forgive you. Step back in the line." &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Come on, young person. If you done something wrong, step out of the line. Make it right before God. Get back in line. &gt;&gt; It ain't no coming service after service and crying out to God for hours and hour. No. Make it right. and say, "God, I was wrong." That's what conviction is. It brings you to a place that you can ask God for repentance and you can make things right. Condemnation just hangs it over your head. &gt;&gt; The devil's constantly, "Oh, he remembers. He got a big list. &gt;&gt; He's constantly trying to bring it up and constantly trying to That is not God talking to you cuz God doesn't even remember it no more. &gt;&gt; He's not the one coming to you when you try to raise your hands and say, "Well, you remember last week or last month or when you used to do this or used to do you remember?" Haha, you that's condemnation. That is the voice of the devil. &gt;&gt; But if you have done wrong and God speaks to your heart, he'll show it to you. Make it clear so you can make it right. &gt;&gt; And once it's right, it's over. &gt;&gt; Step out of the line, make it right. Get back in line. &gt;&gt; But condemnation wants you to step out of the line and stay out of the line. &gt;&gt; Come on. He wants you to step out and and you stay out and you get away from fellowship and you get away from this. Why? Because you're never worthy to come around them people. Listen, we ain't none of us worthy to be here. &gt;&gt; There's not one person sitting in a seat this morning or standing here on this platform or sitting there that is worthy to be here this morning. I'm not here because I'm worthy. I'm here because he's worthy. [Music] I don't believe what I believe cuz I'm worthy. I believe it cuz he's worthy. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; His death gave us the blood and that blood has loosed us. &gt;&gt; There is now no condemnation. What kind of service could we have if there was no condemnation? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. If there wasn't that little thought that wanted to come and Satan implant something in your mind just a moment you're about to have a breakthrough. What if that wasn't there? I'll tell you what would be. You'd go ahead and have your breakthrough. &gt;&gt; What if that wasn't there every time you went to lift your hands or you went to praise God. Listen, I tell you what would happen. You would go ahead and lift your hands. You go ahead and praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you can realize and get a real clear picture of where that stuff is coming from, you'll cast down that condemnation and say, "That's not me. I didn't ask God to forgive me. It's already done. It's finished. It's over with. I'll raise my hands. I'll praise God. I'll glorify him anyway cuz I have a perfect sacrifice. And I have faith in it &gt;&gt; that in if I do make a mistake, there's still a blood. &gt;&gt; I can understand you not having faith in the blood of bulls and goats anymore. &gt;&gt; I can understand you having faith and not having faith and if it was my blood or somebody else in here in blood that you're trying to apply. I can understand that. We're not talking about any of that. &gt;&gt; We're talking about a perfect blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. He saw Adam and Eve as they would leave the garden castaways. Could you imagine the condemnation they had? All the things he done wrong. Brother just reading over it before I come out. Brother Ram says Eve begin to feel that arthritis. She be he be getting to feel those pains. She begins to say, "Adam, what have I done? What have I done?" Adam says, "Eve, what have I done?" And he said, "God was watching Adam go out." He said, "Because Adam didn't have to. He was not deceived. He willingly took her to himself &gt;&gt; cuz he knew if he took her to himself, he would save her or God would have to strike him, too. [Music] And God saw that and he said something sparked in the heart of God. &gt;&gt; He said, "Thy seed." And he begins to talk about the immity. I'll put an immity between thy seed and the serpent's seed. You won't always have to live this way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They used to have to live that way in the Old Testament because they was under the blood of go bulls and goats. Satan had a right to bring his condemnation cuz they would go in with a lust spirit and come out with a lust spirit. They would go in with situations in their life and come right out with it. They had a covering but they didn't have something that would annihilate it. But now as he said, I'll put him in. He said I could just say switch the scene for a moment. He said I see him crying out for his life. I see him screaming for him to be crucified and I watch him walking up that old hill called Goltha and I see a white robe. You start getting bright red spots in it. He said, "Before long, it's all red." And he said, "I see him nail him to the cross. I see him put him up there and push the push the pole up and sink it in the ground. I see him cry out, "God, why hast thou forsaken me?" He said, "But I see him say, it is finished." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. If you do a study, I was actually looking to preach on it, but I hadn't got there yet. But if you do a study on it is finished is a word that means actually three things. All the sin debt is paid. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All the sin data debt is paid. All the debt, all the debt that you ever owed is done away with. Amen. All your healing and deliverance is done. Amen. Not only that, he's also finished the back of Satan. He's crushed him under his feet. Amen. Listen, that that devil that's want to hang over you and put all kind of nonsense on your head, he is a defeated devil. Listen, he that that condemnation that he's putting on you is actually his condemnation. It's what's going to condemn him and put him into hell. Amen. What brother say about that? He said when you ask God to forgive you, all of that sin is rolled off of your back and is transferred onto your accuser. And he said he will go to hell for your sins. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is what it was. He said it's finished. No longer will my children have to be under condemnation, but they can live above it. That's right. Amen. Wonderful.
