[47:47] yourself
[47:53] away, ever.
[48:00] Oh, give him a hand clap of praise. He's
[48:03] worthy. Thank you,
[48:09] Jesus. Are you glad that he never gives
[48:12] up on you? Amen. Keeps coming after me.
[48:14] How many times we have, all of us here
[48:17] could testify. How many times we maybe
[48:20] resisted or ran the other way, but amen.
[48:23] My Bible says that when that prodal son
[48:25] came walking up the road, his father had
[48:27] been waiting, brother Bam said, on the
[48:29] porch waiting for him to return. And
[48:31] when he seen him, he ran after him.
[48:33] Aren't you glad that the love of God
[48:35] pursues you over and over and over and
[48:38] over again. Don't matter how many times
[48:39] you run, he keeps pressing. He keeps
[48:42] preaching. He keeps encouraging. I just
[48:45] say, "Lord, thank you. Thank you for
[48:46] your grace." Amen. Thank you for a
[48:49] voice, amen, in my life. God bless you.
[48:51] Amen. Thank you for all that wonderful
[48:54] worship. Do you love the Lord Jesus?
[48:56] Amen. Don't you just appreciate the
[48:58] presence of the Lord that you feel Amen.
[49:01] in this building. Amen. This morning,
[49:03] just love the Lord with all my heart.
[49:06] Just want to say God bless you. Amen.
[49:08] And it's just an honor to be here with
[49:09] you and to uh to be joined in part of
[49:12] these meetings. I just want to say how
[49:14] much I was so blessed. I think last
[49:16] night, Amen. for just an opening
[49:18] service. Brother Matthew just did a
[49:20] wonderful job. Don't you just Aren't you
[49:22] thankful? Why don't we give the Lord a
[49:24] hand?
[49:25] My praise the
[49:29] Lord. Amen. I just love seeing that he
[49:32] just got himself out of the way and let
[49:35] the Holy Spirit take over. And so we
[49:37] just want to Amen. do our part and just
[49:39] consider amen myself. I really mean this
[49:42] just uh to be the least among anybody
[49:44] that could stand here and speak to you.
[49:47] And I'm just uh thankful for the grace
[49:49] God has had in my own life. I'm thankful
[49:52] to Brother Tim. Amen. And he's been a
[49:54] real friend to me and and for the vision
[49:57] that he had for this youth camp and all
[49:59] of the the many many years that he has
[50:03] uh labored to to do this because it's a
[50:05] labor. It's a labor of love. Amen. And
[50:08] the reward is not money and the reward
[50:11] is not even sometimes a you know
[50:14] sometimes it's very thankless but the
[50:16] reward is an eternal reward. Amen. Of
[50:20] Jesus said lay up your treasures in
[50:23] heaven. And so I believe that every
[50:25] youth camp, what are we doing? We're
[50:26] storing up our treasures. Who is the
[50:28] treasure?
[50:29] You. Amen. The souls of God's family.
[50:32] that that even just one soul would come
[50:34] to the kingdom of God. Then every effort
[50:37] would be worth it. Friends, I just want
[50:39] to say on that day, it'll be worth it
[50:41] all. It'll be worth every youth camp.
[50:44] It'll be worth every prayer. It'll be
[50:46] it'll be worth every tear that you shed.
[50:48] Amen. Let me say that to the parents who
[50:50] sent their young people. It'll be worth
[50:52] every dollar you spent. It'll be worth
[50:54] every sorrow you had to go through. And
[50:56] every time mothers had to be on their
[50:58] knees, pleading out for the blood of
[51:00] Jesus to protect their children. on that
[51:02] day when we've all finally made it home,
[51:04] it'll all be worth it then. Amen. So,
[51:07] just press the battle. Keep keep doing
[51:10] as as uh as brother Matthew said last
[51:12] night, turn the corner. Amen. The Lord
[51:15] has more for us. And I just say, Lord,
[51:17] if you have more than I want to receive
[51:19] it.
[51:21] Amen. Thank you. Amen. For this
[51:23] opportunity to be here. And and I was uh
[51:25] 13, I think, years old when I came here
[51:28] the first time. And somehow this
[51:30] building looked a lot different. I think
[51:31] it was I was looking that way. And uh
[51:34] and so things have changed. Time has
[51:36] changed. But God has never changed.
[51:38] Amen. Friends, the world is changing
[51:40] rapidly. But we've got a we've got a God
[51:42] who never changes. Amen. And his
[51:45] promises are yay and amen. And they're
[51:46] still the same today as they were the
[51:48] day they were written. Amen. Well, if
[51:51] you have your Bible, turn to the book of
[51:52] Daniel, chapter 3. Amen. Daniel, chapter
[51:55] 3.
[52:21] Praise the Lord. You believe the Lord
[52:22] has something for you this morning.
[52:25] Amen. I was I was just um so blessed
[52:28] last night as I said and and the Lord
[52:29] just confirmed something. Amen. So
[52:32] supernatural confirmed what I'm going to
[52:34] preach this morning and what I'll preach
[52:35] this evening. Amen. And and I said it
[52:38] and brother Tim probably didn't know why
[52:39] I said it but I said instead of saying
[52:41] amen I said thank
[52:43] you and I said it you know unknowingly
[52:46] because I was saying thank you Lord that
[52:48] you just confirmed your word just like
[52:50] that. Amen. So thank you. Amen. Thank
[52:53] you to brother Matthew for yielding his
[52:55] vessel. Amen. I want to preach to you.
[52:57] Turn it back to where it was. It was
[52:59] sounding good up here till that I I need
[53:01] it here to be wonderful. Thank you
[53:03] brother. I would like to minister to you
[53:06] on a thought. Amen. The Lord just gave
[53:08] me recently and I I just believe it'll
[53:10] be a blessing. I want to title this
[53:13] standing up to your bully.
[53:18] Now, whether you know it or not, your
[53:20] whole life you've had it. Every single
[53:22] one of us has a different one. But each
[53:25] one of us have a bully that tries to
[53:27] push us into corners our whole life.
[53:30] Brother Brandham said that even at the
[53:32] young age, he would have given his heart
[53:34] to the Lord years before he did, but a
[53:36] spirit had hung over his life. What was
[53:38] that? That was that bully. Amen. Always
[53:41] trying to intimidate. Always trying to
[53:43] stoke fear. And and he said, "I would
[53:45] have surrendered." And he he tells us
[53:47] later that was a voice in his life
[53:49] saying, "Oh, you got time. You know, it
[53:52] doesn't have to be today. You got time.
[53:54] Just keep living your life." And he said
[53:56] that spirit hung over his life and he
[53:58] should have surrendered his life to the
[54:00] Lord years before that. But that spirit
[54:02] hung over him. I want to say Lord don't
[54:04] let any spirit hang over my life to keep
[54:07] me from the time that the Lord is
[54:09] calling me. Amen. Daniel chapter 3. We
[54:12] just want to begin reading here very
[54:13] familiar
[54:16] scripture.
[54:18] Um Daniel chapter 3. We know this very
[54:21] well. Nebuchadnezzar the king made an
[54:22] image of gold. We're going to skip down
[54:24] past some of this. He he invites all of
[54:27] the verse two, the captains and the
[54:29] princes and the governors and the
[54:31] judges, all the important people, the
[54:33] sheriffs, the counselors. And it says in
[54:35] verse four, then a herald cried aloud
[54:38] and it said to you it is commanded all
[54:40] people, nations, and languages that at
[54:43] what time you hear the sound. And notice
[54:45] how that music is going to play a very
[54:47] important role. You see, music has
[54:50] creates has the ability to create an
[54:52] atmosphere. And let me just say this
[54:54] that there is a certain tune that the
[54:57] rest of the world is marching to. But
[54:59] there is also a beat that the bride of
[55:02] Jesus Christ is to be marching to. And
[55:04] we're not to align oursel to the world
[55:07] or the rhythm of the world, but you've
[55:09] been called out of that rhythm and to a
[55:11] rhythm from above.
[55:13] And notice here he says when you hear
[55:15] the sound of this music, the flute, the
[55:17] cornet, the harp, all of these
[55:18] instruments, and it says that uh if you
[55:21] fall down and worship the golden image
[55:23] that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up,
[55:26] notice the intimidation immediately. All
[55:28] right? And who so fallth not down and
[55:33] worshipeth shall that same hour be cast
[55:37] into the midst of a burning fiery
[55:40] furnace.
[55:42] Therefore, at that time when all the
[55:43] people heard the sound of all the music,
[55:47] the Bible says they fell down and
[55:49] worshiped. Wherefore at that time
[55:51] certain Shaldanss came near and accused
[55:54] the Jews. They spake and said to the
[55:56] king Nebuchadnezzar, "Oh king, live
[55:58] forever. Thou, oh king, has made a
[56:00] decree that every man that shall hear
[56:02] the sound of the all of this music shall
[56:04] fall down and worship the golden image.
[56:07] And who so fallth not down and
[56:08] worshipeth shall he be cast into the
[56:10] midst of a burning fiery furnace. There
[56:14] are certain Jews. Uh-huh. There are
[56:16] certain ones. You see, you say, "Why you
[56:19] got to be different?" Because they were
[56:20] made to be different. Let me say this to
[56:23] you young people. You were not made to
[56:25] fit in. You were made to stick out.
[56:29] You were made to be an example to the
[56:32] devil that in the darkest age, in the
[56:34] most wicked time, when the whole
[56:36] atmosphere is against you, that you'll
[56:38] keep your testimony that Jesus is still
[56:41] the same today, yesterday, and he'll be
[56:43] the same forever more. Let me say it
[56:46] this way. You were made to be different.
[56:50] says that they were certain who the
[56:52] Bible says in verse 12, Shadrach, Meek,
[56:55] and Abedneo. These men, oh king, have
[56:57] not regarded thee. They serve not thy
[56:59] God, nor worshiped the golden image that
[57:01] thouast set up. Then Nebuchadnezzar in
[57:03] his rage and fury commanded to bring
[57:05] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo. Then
[57:07] they brought them in before the king.
[57:09] Nebuchadnezzar spake and said, notice
[57:11] his words. Come on, guys. Really?
[57:16] Really? You got to be odd.
[57:18] You got to stick out. Come on, guys.
[57:20] Really? You going to do this? I mean,
[57:22] everybody's Everybody's going this. You
[57:25] just go with the flow, Shadrach.
[57:28] Come on. Your whole school's doing it.
[57:30] Why you got to be different? Why you got
[57:32] to be an oddball? Why you got Why you
[57:33] got to stick out like that? I'll tell
[57:35] you why. Because I was designed to be
[57:37] different than you. I am not them. You
[57:39] are not them. And they are not you.
[57:42] I want to let that sink in. Let me say
[57:44] it again. You are not them. and they are
[57:48] not you. So don't try to look like them.
[57:50] Don't try to dress like them. We
[57:52] shouldn't try to preach like them. We
[57:54] shouldn't try to sing like them. God
[57:56] made us different by design.
[58:02] And he says here, notice, is it true?
[58:04] Come on, guys. Really, you you want to
[58:06] be different. He says, come on. Is it
[58:08] true? Shadrach, Meack, and Abedneo.
[58:11] Verse 14, he says, is it true? Do you do
[58:14] you, he says, do you not serve my
[58:17] gods nor worship the golden image? Now,
[58:20] now notice verse 15. If you be ready
[58:23] that at the time, in other words, go
[58:24] ahead and play the play it again, boys.
[58:26] These guys just made an innocent
[58:28] mistake. All right,
[58:31] you see what the devil didn't realize is
[58:33] that their conviction went further than
[58:35] their mom, than their dad, than their
[58:37] pastor. But the real believer's
[58:40] conviction goes way down into the cavern
[58:42] of your soul. And it doesn't matter if
[58:44] the whole world goes against you, you
[58:46] will keep your ground and stand up to
[58:49] your bully.
[58:52] And he says, "If you be ready that you
[58:54] hear that Shadrach, Mach verse 16 of
[58:56] Abedneo answered and said, I love this
[58:58] answer. Oh Nebuchadnezzar, we are not
[59:01] careful to answer thee in this matter."
[59:04] Let's pray. Lord, we thank you for your
[59:07] reading of your word this morning.
[59:09] Already feeling the uncction of the
[59:10] spirit. Lord, I just want to say today,
[59:13] I'm so grateful, Lord, that you called
[59:16] me. I'm so grateful that you chose me,
[59:19] Lord, but I feel so unworthy at times.
[59:22] Feels Lord, like I'm the last one, Lord,
[59:26] but your grace somehow has prevailed in
[59:28] my life. All of us, no doubt, feel that
[59:31] way, Lord. I pray God that at this
[59:33] moment that we could just pull up a
[59:35] chair to your table Lord and all of us
[59:37] would raise hands and say, "Lord, I'm
[59:39] needy this morning and I just want a
[59:41] touch from you." Oh God, bless those
[59:43] hands up to say, "Lord, come and touch
[59:45] me by your word. May it sink further
[59:47] than my than skin deep. May it go down
[59:50] to the very soul, Lord, and change us,
[59:53] Father, the very nature." We pray. Grant
[59:55] it, Lord, we ask in Jesus Christ's name.
[59:57] Amen. You can be seated.
[1:00:00] It's amazing and so powerful to me
[1:00:02] because you look at this and you can see
[1:00:04] that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo,
[1:00:07] this answer that they give him was very
[1:00:09] firm. It was a very firm answer and and
[1:00:14] uh there was no second-guing it. Let's
[1:00:17] keep reading it here if we could. You
[1:00:18] keep your Bible open there in verse 16.
[1:00:21] I want you to notice the answer that he
[1:00:23] gives them. The Bible says, "Shadrach,
[1:00:25] Meshach, and Abedneo answered." This was
[1:00:28] their answer and said to the king, "You
[1:00:30] see, there's there's ve something very
[1:00:32] important with how you stand." There's
[1:00:34] something very important because there's
[1:00:36] no question the devil will come at you.
[1:00:38] There's no question the devil's going to
[1:00:40] come and attack you. And in fact, his
[1:00:42] voice in this age is louder than it's
[1:00:45] ever been before. It's more bold. It's
[1:00:48] in your face more than it's ever been
[1:00:50] before. And so, it's very critical where
[1:00:53] you stand. It's important what you
[1:00:55] believe. You see, what you believe will
[1:00:58] determine how you live. I realized that
[1:01:01] a long time ago. What a person believes.
[1:01:03] That's why it's important that we know,
[1:01:05] not our mom, what our mom told us, what
[1:01:07] our daddy told us, what the pastor tells
[1:01:09] us, but we know within oursel as the
[1:01:12] Bible says, I know in whom I have
[1:01:15] believed.
[1:01:17] How you believe will determine how you
[1:01:19] live. And how you live will determine
[1:01:21] your habits. Your habits will determine
[1:01:23] your character. And your character will
[1:01:26] ultimately determine your destiny. And
[1:01:29] so your the to a believer, your
[1:01:31] conviction runs very deep. It's very
[1:01:34] important where you stand and what you
[1:01:36] do when the devil comes attacking you.
[1:01:38] You don't have to turn, but in second
[1:01:40] Kings chapter 20, it's an amazing story
[1:01:42] of a of a of a backsliding king, a man
[1:01:45] uh who was an Israelite, one who was no
[1:01:49] different really than Shadrach or
[1:01:50] Meshack and Abedneo. But but yet there
[1:01:53] was something that in his testimony that
[1:01:55] when the enemy came against him, his
[1:01:57] answer was so very different than
[1:02:00] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo. In fir
[1:02:03] in in first Kings chapter 20, the Ben
[1:02:06] Benhaden is the name of this evil man.
[1:02:09] And his name actually means the son of
[1:02:12] whirlwinds. That's what his name means.
[1:02:13] You see, Hayden was his dad. And his
[1:02:16] dad, his name literally meant the king
[1:02:19] of the whirlwind. In other words, this
[1:02:21] was an evil man. This wasn't an
[1:02:23] Israelite. And here's his son who was
[1:02:26] going to be like the reincarnation of
[1:02:28] his father, Ben Hayden. You pick it up
[1:02:31] in in in in First Kings chapter 20, it
[1:02:33] says, "Ben Hayden, the king of Syria,
[1:02:35] gathered all his army together. 32 kings
[1:02:38] were with him, horses and chariots, and
[1:02:40] they went up and closed in on Samaria
[1:02:42] and fought against it." So notice here
[1:02:44] was an Israelite king, and he here's an
[1:02:48] army that's going to come against him.
[1:02:49] the whirlwind's coming. And notice the
[1:02:52] threat or the intimidation of this bully
[1:02:55] as Ben Hayden says to him and he says he
[1:02:58] said he sent messengers into the city of
[1:03:00] Ahab, king of Israel, and he said, "Thus
[1:03:03] Seth Ben Hayden, your silver and your
[1:03:06] gold are mine. Your best wives and
[1:03:09] children are also mine." Yeah. So notice
[1:03:12] immediately the voice of the bully will
[1:03:16] always try to intimidate you or strike
[1:03:19] fear in your heart. Now remember brother
[1:03:22] Brandham said there's only two conduits
[1:03:24] either fear doubt or faith. And let me
[1:03:28] say that if God works through faith then
[1:03:30] the devil works through fear.
[1:03:33] And he uses words as any bully does as
[1:03:36] you know this very well that a bully you
[1:03:39] know I I had one in my life at a very
[1:03:41] young age a man a boy at school and he
[1:03:44] wanted to fight me and I was not much of
[1:03:46] a fighter. I'll be honest with you my
[1:03:48] brother was the big fighter in the
[1:03:50] family and it could have been a could
[1:03:51] have been a boxer but man I I didn't I I
[1:03:53] I didn't like to fight. didn't like to
[1:03:55] quarrel or or like to tangle. But you
[1:03:58] know this there comes something I don't
[1:04:01] care if you're a fighter if you're not a
[1:04:02] fighter. There comes something in
[1:04:03] everybody that if you push that person
[1:04:05] hard enough if you push that person deep
[1:04:08] enough and you keep on and you're
[1:04:09] persistent finally even the even the you
[1:04:12] know the the the biggest person who
[1:04:14] doesn't want to fight finally says you
[1:04:15] know what if you want to if you want to
[1:04:16] go man let's go.
[1:04:21] And so this boy just wanted to fight me.
[1:04:23] So, I told him to come to my
[1:04:25] neighborhood on, you know, on Saturday
[1:04:27] and and he'll fight me. Told him where I
[1:04:28] live. Well, guess what? He's my age, but
[1:04:31] he shows up with his 18-year-old
[1:04:32] brother, and I'm 14 years old.
[1:04:36] And now he's too afraid to fight me. So,
[1:04:38] he sends his 18-year-old brother to come
[1:04:39] and fight me. I couldn't believe it.
[1:04:41] Well, I you know what? I I wasn't about
[1:04:43] to go face this guy, man. He was He was
[1:04:45] a foot taller than me, wingspan, way
[1:04:47] bigger than me. And so, I went I said,
[1:04:49] "Man, I'm not fighting your brother." I
[1:04:51] went and you know what I did? I had a
[1:04:52] brother, too.
[1:04:56] And so I went and my brother was just I
[1:04:58] don't want to tell the whole thing. I'm
[1:04:59] fighting to tell it because it'll
[1:05:00] embarrass me. But but let's just say it
[1:05:02] was Sunday morning and we were we should
[1:05:04] have been getting ready for church. And
[1:05:07] and so I wake my brother up and I'll
[1:05:09] never forget as I stir him. You know,
[1:05:10] something was so different in him
[1:05:12] because the second you said fight, he
[1:05:14] said, "Sign me up."
[1:05:19] And it didn't matter the size, didn't
[1:05:20] matter how big, didn't matter the
[1:05:22] threat. And I woke up my brother
[1:05:23] Jonathan. I never forget that moment
[1:05:25] when I said, "You got a brother? I got a
[1:05:27] brother, too." And I told him, I said,
[1:05:28] "You know, Josh's got his brother
[1:05:30] Charles. He's bigger than me. And he's
[1:05:32] 18-year-old." My brother was only 15,
[1:05:33] but he looked about 19. And and and he's
[1:05:37] great big old broad shoulder, wide guy
[1:05:39] like your son, Matthew, a big old guy.
[1:05:41] And and on and and you know what? We we
[1:05:43] we went outside and they had went to the
[1:05:45] next neighborhood. And and so I go over
[1:05:47] to the we go over to the next
[1:05:48] neighborhood and here he was, man. Big
[1:05:50] old guy with his threats and you know
[1:05:52] his his insults and and you know that's
[1:05:55] what that's exactly how the devil is.
[1:05:56] He'll try to do all the tra he'll try to
[1:05:59] talk to you and and and tell you he
[1:06:01] ain't nothing and and and intimidate you
[1:06:03] and use words of fear and listen
[1:06:05] friends, sometimes we be honest,
[1:06:06] sometimes he's a lot bigger than us as
[1:06:09] far as strength and muscles. He's a lot
[1:06:11] taller, might be a lot bigger. Goliath
[1:06:13] was a lot bigger than David.
[1:06:16] And here he was with his with his
[1:06:18] threats. But you know what? My brother
[1:06:19] was not afraid. But my dad always taught
[1:06:21] us something. He said, "Listen," he
[1:06:22] said, and my dad always raised us this
[1:06:24] way. He said, "You ain't if you throw
[1:06:25] the first punch, you're going to have to
[1:06:28] answer to me. But if you don't throw the
[1:06:30] second punch, you're going to have to
[1:06:32] answer to me."
[1:06:37] In other words, if you don't defend
[1:06:38] yourself, we got a problem. And so my
[1:06:41] brother knew that. He wasn't allowed to
[1:06:42] throw the first punch. He's sitting
[1:06:43] there on his bicycle like this. And and
[1:06:45] man, that that guy's, you know, much
[1:06:47] taller and you could it is so funny
[1:06:49] seeing the his his little brother that
[1:06:50] God was supposed to fight me, man. He
[1:06:52] was so, you know, behind him and he was
[1:06:54] so big, you know, and so bad, you know,
[1:06:55] when he had his big old brother like
[1:06:57] that. And so I just watched and watched
[1:06:59] my brother Jonathan. He sat there on the
[1:07:00] bike. He said, "Hey man, why why you
[1:07:02] doing this? You know, you come out here,
[1:07:03] my brother's younger than you. You're
[1:07:05] going to fight him?" He said, "Oh, you
[1:07:06] want to fight me?" Just waited for that
[1:07:08] moment. Well, he kicked he kicked the
[1:07:10] spokes of my brother's bike. And I
[1:07:13] thought,
[1:07:14] uhoh, that was a big mistake,
[1:07:17] buddy. My brother gently put down that
[1:07:19] bike and he said, "Go ahead, Charles. Go
[1:07:21] ahead. Hit me. Do something." Man, he
[1:07:23] tried, you know, he was too much of a,
[1:07:25] you know, a coward. Rather than throwing
[1:07:27] a punch, he tried to tried to kick him,
[1:07:29] uh, you know, in the spot that really
[1:07:30] hurts for a
[1:07:32] guy. And my brother moved back like
[1:07:34] that. And I'll never forget, it was like
[1:07:36] one motion, man. He jumped to dodged
[1:07:38] that kick and when he came down he rared
[1:07:40] back and
[1:07:41] pow and that big old giant hit the
[1:07:44] ground. My brother got on top of him
[1:07:46] said started beating him said you had
[1:07:48] enough. I tell you what it was. There
[1:07:50] was a bully in my life but I had a big
[1:07:52] brother who is greater than my bully.
[1:07:54] And let me tell you something. You might
[1:07:56] have something attacking you in your
[1:07:58] life. But you've got a
[1:08:00] brother. You've got a savior. And he's
[1:08:02] the mighty conqueror. He ain't never
[1:08:04] lost a battle.
[1:08:08] Hallelujah.
[1:08:10] But he used the threats and the
[1:08:11] intimidation to try to, you know, to try
[1:08:13] to back him up into a corner and say,
[1:08:15] "You ain't nobody. You never do
[1:08:16] anything." It's just like this man met
[1:08:18] Hayden. You know, your silver is mine.
[1:08:21] Your gold is mine. Listen to this. Your
[1:08:23] best wives are mine. Your children are
[1:08:25] mine. The king of an Listen to what the
[1:08:28] king of Israel answered. The king of
[1:08:30] Israel answered and said, "As you say,
[1:08:34] my
[1:08:36] Lord, notice, no
[1:08:40] [Music]
[1:08:42] resistance, no
[1:08:44] fight, no argument. Didn't even
[1:08:46] negotiate.
[1:08:48] Your silver's mine, your gold's mine,"
[1:08:51] the bully said. "Your wife's mine, your
[1:08:53] children's mine." And yet there was
[1:08:56] something in this man's heart that was
[1:08:58] so fearful that he actually just said,
[1:09:01] "As you say, Lord, as you say, Ben
[1:09:04] Hayden, as you say, whirlwind, you're
[1:09:07] going to come and take my family. You're
[1:09:08] going to come and take my health. You're
[1:09:09] going to come and take my body." Listen,
[1:09:12] friends, if you let hell, hell will
[1:09:14] control your life. It'll control your
[1:09:16] testimony. Let me just say this. If you
[1:09:18] don't learn to resist the devil, he
[1:09:21] won't stop. He'll keep coming. He'll
[1:09:23] keep punching. He'll keep coming at you.
[1:09:25] And if he listen friends, he wants to
[1:09:27] destroy you.
[1:09:31] He doesn't just want to hurt your
[1:09:32] feelings. Come on. He doesn't even just
[1:09:35] want to injure you. He wants to take
[1:09:37] your life.
[1:09:40] And yet there was nothing in this man
[1:09:43] that could stand up to this bully. He
[1:09:46] says, "As you
[1:09:48] say, shocked by those words, listen to
[1:09:51] this. as you say, my lord, oh king, I am
[1:09:54] yours.
[1:09:57] And all that I have is yours. All right.
[1:10:02] I'm afraid that's many times like some
[1:10:04] of us to where we've gotten so used to
[1:10:08] the attack of the devil, the bully in
[1:10:10] our life
[1:10:12] that we can still serve the Lord, we can
[1:10:14] still love the Lord, but we allow that
[1:10:15] bully just to stay present in our life.
[1:10:19] And if we're not careful, we'll we'll
[1:10:21] we'll start to do a negotiation with the
[1:10:23] devil.
[1:10:25] And so here was this king and he
[1:10:27] literally starts to
[1:10:29] negotiate a surrender.
[1:10:32] He starts to negotiate a
[1:10:35] surrender. And if we're not careful, I
[1:10:38] just feel the Holy Spirit right now. If
[1:10:41] we're not careful, we'll make a
[1:10:43] negotiation with the devil
[1:10:45] and say, "As long as you let me do this
[1:10:47] and and I'll give you this and this and
[1:10:49] this." Listen, friends, you ain't got to
[1:10:51] make a negotiation with the devil today.
[1:10:54] You don't have to back down to that
[1:10:55] bully. You don't have to surrender to
[1:10:57] his taunting and his threats. Can I just
[1:10:59] say it this way? You need to learn to
[1:11:01] talk back to the devil and channel the
[1:11:04] voice of God in your life and speak to
[1:11:07] that spirit in your life.
[1:11:10] Can I say it this way? Don't let the
[1:11:11] devil do all the trash talking. Don't
[1:11:14] let the devil tell you, "I'm going to
[1:11:15] have you. I'm going to take your body.
[1:11:17] I'm going to take your job." You got to
[1:11:19] fight back at that devil. You got to
[1:11:21] speak and say, "You can't have me,
[1:11:23] Satan. You can't have my body. You can't
[1:11:26] have my mother. You can't have my
[1:11:28] father. You can't have this
[1:11:32] church. You got to speak back to that
[1:11:35] bully.
[1:11:40] Amen.
[1:11:42] Nebuchadnezzar, notice this answer. Can
[1:11:44] we go back to our story here in Daniel
[1:11:46] chapter 3 before we run out of time this
[1:11:48] morning? Notice the difference in these
[1:11:50] boys. Shadrach, verse 16 of Daniel
[1:11:53] chapter 3. Shadrach, Meshach, and
[1:11:56] Abedneo answered and said to the king,
[1:11:58] "Oh, Nebuchadnezzar, notice this. Turn
[1:12:01] in your Bible, Daniel 3. If you don't
[1:12:02] have it, don't just let me read it. I
[1:12:03] want you to read it.
[1:12:06] Nebuchadnezzar. Oh, if you be ready,
[1:12:08] then at the time you hear the sound of
[1:12:10] all this music and all of the atmosphere
[1:12:12] and everything's going that way, guys.
[1:12:15] When you hear it again, just bow on
[1:12:17] down. Just just just submit. Just go
[1:12:21] with the flow. Just be like everybody.
[1:12:24] It'll all be okay for you. Yeah. You
[1:12:26] know, you don't have to tell anybody
[1:12:27] you're a believer. You just keep that
[1:12:30] part quiet.
[1:12:32] Come on. You don't have to really make
[1:12:33] yourself odd or make yourself weird. Do
[1:12:35] we have to be so weird and so odd?
[1:12:38] You don't have to really, you know,
[1:12:39] stand out. Just just sort of, you know,
[1:12:41] fit in.
[1:12:43] Let me say that's a lot easier for a guy
[1:12:45] than it is a girl.
[1:12:48] Let me just preach here for a moment,
[1:12:50] guys. God's calling you to make a stand.
[1:12:54] God ain't calling you to fit in and to
[1:12:56] mel mold and and just be, you know, just
[1:12:58] meld into the rest of the world and Lady
[1:13:00] Aa and the spirits of this age. God is
[1:13:03] calling this age of men. Where is men of
[1:13:06] God that'll make a stand for the word of
[1:13:08] God? Men of principle that doesn't care
[1:13:10] what the what my friend does. Doesn't
[1:13:12] matter what the rest of the school does.
[1:13:14] Your conviction runs deep.
[1:13:17] Amen. Amen. Oh, just be like everybody
[1:13:20] else, you know, just sort of fit in. You
[1:13:22] know, you know, when you hear the sound,
[1:13:25] Nebuchadnezzar says, "Then you know,
[1:13:26] notice this answer in verse 16. I love
[1:13:28] it so much. Shadrach, Meshach, and
[1:13:30] Abednego and answered and said unto the
[1:13:32] king, "Oh
[1:13:33] Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to
[1:13:37] answer thee in this matter." Let me give
[1:13:39] you my generation's words of their
[1:13:41] answer. Satan, talk to the hand.
[1:13:47] Or talk to the elbow cuz you ain't worth
[1:13:49] the extension. Listen friends, the
[1:13:52] moment you start talking to the devil,
[1:13:54] you have given him too much credit. The
[1:13:57] moment you start speaking to the devil,
[1:13:59] Shadrach said, "I don't even have to
[1:14:00] answer you, Satan. You don't deserve a
[1:14:03] moment of my time. You don't deserve a
[1:14:05] moment of my energy. You don't deserve a
[1:14:08] conversation.
[1:14:12] We're not careful to answer thee."
[1:14:14] Listen to this answer. If so, if it be
[1:14:17] so, our God whom we serve, how many can
[1:14:20] say this, is able. Here's my answer.
[1:14:22] Satan, you might taunt me. You might
[1:14:25] tempt me. You might put me in a fire,
[1:14:27] but I want you to know my God is able to
[1:14:30] deliver me.
[1:14:33] My God is able to deliver me out of the
[1:14:35] fiery furnace, and he will deliver us
[1:14:38] out of thy hand, oh king. I love this
[1:14:41] answer, my brother, my sister, because
[1:14:43] it's a firm answer.
[1:14:46] It's a firm answer. It's a principle.
[1:14:48] They stood upon something. They weren't
[1:14:51] ashamed of it. They didn't matter if it
[1:14:54] cost their life.
[1:14:57] Now, I want to show you here for a
[1:14:58] moment what a true stand is because many
[1:15:00] people can have this verse kind of
[1:15:02] faith. But can you go further than verse
[1:15:05] 17?
[1:15:08] Verse 18 says, "But
[1:15:12] if not,
[1:15:16] hold on,
[1:15:19] hold on. We were talking about God and
[1:15:21] God is able. He's going to deliver. He's
[1:15:23] going to heal. He's going to save you.
[1:15:24] See, many people can have that kind of
[1:15:25] faith. And that's wonderful. We believe
[1:15:27] God can. We believe God will.
[1:15:30] But you'll never stand in this
[1:15:33] generation with verse 17 faith. Amen.
[1:15:37] You see, only verse 18 faith produced
[1:15:40] the fourth man in the middle of the
[1:15:42] fire.
[1:15:44] It wasn't until the principle of
[1:15:46] standing when Shadrach, Meshach, and
[1:15:48] Abedneo could say, "Our God's able. Our
[1:15:50] God can. But I want you to hear me,
[1:15:52] Satan. I want to make sure you hear my
[1:15:55] testimony. I want to make sure you know
[1:15:57] how deep my conviction is. Even if he
[1:16:00] doesn't, I don't mean that God ain't a
[1:16:02] healer. If he doesn't deliver, that
[1:16:04] don't mean he ain't a deliverer. I want
[1:16:05] you to know, Satan, I'm not going to
[1:16:07] bow. I'm not going to compromise. I'm
[1:16:10] not going to back
[1:16:14] up. I will stand for Jesus. I will stand
[1:16:18] for the message of the hour. I will
[1:16:20] stand with a bold faith that says it
[1:16:23] doesn't matter what happens to me. Be it
[1:16:26] known, oh king,
[1:16:29] we will not bow.
[1:16:34] Glory.
[1:16:37] This was a true man. This was a true
[1:16:40] faith. This is what it means to stand up
[1:16:45] to your bully.
[1:16:48] Yes, sir.
[1:16:50] You see, it was this kind of faith that
[1:16:52] was so that is so lost. Can I just
[1:16:55] preach here for a moment? It's this kind
[1:16:57] of faith that is so lost in our
[1:16:59] generation. It's the kind of world I
[1:17:01] just be honest with you, friends, that
[1:17:03] we live in to where nobody wants to take
[1:17:05] a stand. I'm not talking about a
[1:17:06] political stand. I'm not talking about,
[1:17:08] you know, wearing Trump stickers on your
[1:17:10] on your shirt and MAGA hats. I'm not I'm
[1:17:12] not talking about any of that.
[1:17:15] I'm not talking about some kind of
[1:17:17] political stand, but I'm talking about
[1:17:19] standing for the word.
[1:17:22] Standing for the way that's unpopular,
[1:17:25] standing when nobody else can stand with
[1:17:27] you. You see, it was this kind of
[1:17:28] generation. Did you know that actually
[1:17:30] it would be prophesied uh that that that
[1:17:33] men would lose their identity? That
[1:17:35] women would lose their identity. We've
[1:17:37] gotten to such a place to where
[1:17:39] everybody's so afraid. I was watching a
[1:17:40] man preach a mega church pastor, not
[1:17:43] criticizing the man at all. Uh you no no
[1:17:45] doubt doing what he thinks is best to
[1:17:47] do. And here he's before his whole crowd
[1:17:49] of people and and you know and he's
[1:17:51] trying so hard to make a speech about
[1:17:53] the transgender and the homosexual, you
[1:17:55] know, LGBT kind of thing. And and here
[1:17:58] he is, he's got all this pressure, man.
[1:18:00] And you could tell he's just trying to
[1:18:02] be so careful. He's he won't even talk.
[1:18:04] He's just reading, you know, to make
[1:18:05] sure he doesn't, you know, make a
[1:18:06] mistake in the way he says it. He's
[1:18:08] trying to be, you know, I I He's trying
[1:18:10] to, you know, well, we we we I just want
[1:18:13] you to to know he's trying to, you know,
[1:18:14] find where he stands that no, we don't
[1:18:16] believe in in in gay life, but but, you
[1:18:19] know, we we also don't want to, you
[1:18:20] know, be weird and and, you know, and
[1:18:22] and and upset anybody and make anybody
[1:18:24] mad. And he's trying to sort of, you
[1:18:25] know, somewhere find the balance in the
[1:18:28] two. He's just, you know, and he says,
[1:18:29] "I I just want to say we welcome you,
[1:18:32] LGBT. We love you." And and and we just
[1:18:35] want you to know that God loves you. and
[1:18:37] and and and I thought, my goodness, what
[1:18:40] I'm so glad I don't have to stand there
[1:18:42] in that pull pit and care about what
[1:18:45] CNN's going to say or Fox is going to
[1:18:47] say or the school's going to say or the
[1:18:49] community is going to say. I thought,
[1:18:50] man, you don't realize that the only
[1:18:53] thing that will set them free is if you
[1:18:56] speak the truth.
[1:18:59] Can I just say this? The only thing that
[1:19:02] will set people free is sometimes you
[1:19:04] just got to say it the way it was
[1:19:06] spoken.
[1:19:08] And he's up there trying to dance around
[1:19:10] and dance around and dance around and
[1:19:11] walk on eggshells. I thought to myself,
[1:19:13] this is exactly a perfect portrait of
[1:19:15] the world. Everybody's got to walk on
[1:19:17] eggshells and got to be careful how you
[1:19:19] say it. Make sure you don't say it too
[1:19:21] harsh and make sure you know. And if
[1:19:23] that's not the spirit that comes like a
[1:19:24] bully trying to intimidate us, say, you
[1:19:26] know, don't be so weird now. You ain't
[1:19:28] got to say God. You ain't got You ain't
[1:19:30] got to quote the prophet so much. You
[1:19:31] ain't got to say brother Brandham. Don't
[1:19:33] be weird now. You know, you know there's
[1:19:35] a spirit trying to water things down.
[1:19:37] And you know that was oldfashioned,
[1:19:39] brother Tim. And brother Bandham said
[1:19:40] that years ago. Wasn't he a little out
[1:19:42] of touch with you know with with our
[1:19:44] gener? Don't we have to you know we can
[1:19:46] just change it. We can you know we can
[1:19:48] modernize the message
[1:19:51] you know make it more palpable so people
[1:19:53] will you know accept it more. If we we
[1:19:55] just stop making ourselves so weird, you
[1:19:57] know, more people I I got news for you.
[1:19:59] The message isn't for everybody. The
[1:20:02] message isn't for the whole world. We're
[1:20:04] not trying to change it or or what don't
[1:20:06] you realize when you water it down, you
[1:20:09] abort its effect in your life as a
[1:20:11] cleansing token.
[1:20:13] [Music]
[1:20:16] And we got to change it. We got to
[1:20:18] modernize it. Oh, I got to preach this
[1:20:19] here today. You help me preach. The
[1:20:22] Bible was never written to be accepted
[1:20:24] by the whole world. I said the Bible was
[1:20:27] not even written to be accepted by all
[1:20:29] of the world. And it wasn't meant Let me
[1:20:32] just say this here today. Your Bible is
[1:20:34] the most controversial book that's ever
[1:20:36] been written. Jesus didn't say there's
[1:20:38] many ways. He said, "I am the way. I am
[1:20:41] the truth. I am the life. There is no
[1:20:43] other way to the father outside of me."
[1:20:46] Listen, the that the Bible was never
[1:20:48] meant to be accepted by everybody. It
[1:20:50] was meant to be a sword
[1:20:54] [Music]
[1:20:56] and it divides the truth from the error.
[1:21:02] And we live in such a climate to where
[1:21:04] everybody's, you know, so backed up and
[1:21:06] afraid. Don't hurt their feelings. I got
[1:21:08] news for you. Feelings are overrated.
[1:21:11] [Applause]
[1:21:14] Put that on a t-shirt and wear
[1:21:16] it. Everybody's so so afraid to say
[1:21:19] something wrong. This is the age that we
[1:21:22] live in. Oh, I can hear a prophet
[1:21:24] saying, and I love this so much when
[1:21:25] he's talking about men. He says, "Dear
[1:21:27] God, I pray." He says, "We took we look
[1:21:30] at these boys just look so much like
[1:21:32] girls wearing clothes like them. We can
[1:21:35] see girls trying to act like boys and
[1:21:37] see women and men in this perverted age.
[1:21:39] See, sex appeal has become an idol of
[1:21:41] worship. The gospel has been pushed out
[1:21:44] to one side and the nakedness in the
[1:21:46] Lady of Sea of Church. Oh God, he says,
[1:21:48] "What an hour, Lord Jesus, make yourself
[1:21:51] known. Oh God, that's like the pull
[1:21:53] pit." Uhoh.
[1:21:56] You see, brother Brandon would prophesy
[1:21:58] of this and he would say that parent de
[1:22:00] child delinquency is only the cause or
[1:22:03] the root or the offspring of parent
[1:22:06] delinquency.
[1:22:07] You see, when parents don't make a stand
[1:22:09] and they're jellyfish and don't really
[1:22:11] live a bold life, then the children
[1:22:13] don't know where to stand. The children
[1:22:15] just become a bunch of lukewarm
[1:22:17] somewhere halfway in the middle. That's
[1:22:19] right.
[1:22:21] But then, Brother Brandham took it
[1:22:22] further than that and said, "It's not
[1:22:23] even just parent delinquency. It's
[1:22:25] pullpit delinquency because men won't
[1:22:28] say the truth like it was spoken."
[1:22:33] Brother Bham said, "That's like the
[1:22:35] pullpit." And I love this so much. Where
[1:22:37] is man?
[1:22:39] Where is man?
[1:22:42] Man, that's man
[1:22:44] that stands for a principle.
[1:22:50] Where is women that stands for a
[1:22:53] principle? Where's a church that stands
[1:22:55] for a principle? I ain't got a nickels
[1:22:57] worth of time for a wishy-washy, give
[1:23:00] in, compromising spirit. Come on, can
[1:23:03] you help me preach?
[1:23:04] A woman is a woman, let her be a lady.
[1:23:06] If a man is a man, let him be a man.
[1:23:11] Say, Brother Matt, how did we get to
[1:23:13] this
[1:23:13] condition? How did we arrive here?
[1:23:17] And it's not just the United States of
[1:23:19] America. In fact, we're one of the last,
[1:23:20] right? To to where the world doesn't
[1:23:23] know what a woman is, right? Doesn't
[1:23:26] know what a man is.
[1:23:28] And they're afraid to to define it.
[1:23:30] They're afraid to speak it. I tell you
[1:23:33] why. Because there's a bully in this
[1:23:34] agemen
[1:23:36] that it's got everybody so fearful to
[1:23:38] say it. Listen, I'm not talking about
[1:23:40] being, you know, a chauvinist and just
[1:23:41] being mean. The real nature of Christ.
[1:23:43] You're a gentleman. That's right. But
[1:23:46] let me just say this. We had the example
[1:23:48] through a seventh angel messenger that
[1:23:51] was humble, that loved everybody,
[1:23:54] but he had a backbone
[1:23:56] and he stood for a principle and he
[1:23:59] would not compromise the word of God.
[1:24:01] You say, "Brother Matt, what did he do?"
[1:24:02] He had the He had the the nature of
[1:24:05] Christ in that he was loving. He never
[1:24:07] drew circles. Come on, somebody.
[1:24:10] In fact, he drew circles bigger.
[1:24:13] Amen. But yet, he stood for the truth.
[1:24:17] Hallelujah.
[1:24:19] And we've gotten to the place in our
[1:24:20] world to where it's in our schools, it's
[1:24:23] in our government, it's in our colleges,
[1:24:25] it's in our university. And I just want
[1:24:27] to say it. It ain't just the
[1:24:29] northerners. Come on, Southerners. It
[1:24:31] ain't just the Yankees. It ain't just
[1:24:32] the Canadians. Sorry. It ain't just the
[1:24:34] Europeans. It's going all the way down
[1:24:37] into the Bible belt to where churches
[1:24:40] are compromising. Ain't getting a got
[1:24:42] their they're they're hilings afraid to
[1:24:44] say anything. That's right. But it ought
[1:24:47] not to be with the message of the hour.
[1:24:49] If there's anybody who can take the
[1:24:51] truth, it's the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:24:54] If there's anybody that'll say, "Preach
[1:24:56] the word of God. Preach it for the man.
[1:24:58] Don't be fearful of what I think. Don't
[1:25:01] compromise the word of God for what I
[1:25:03] think. Preach it just the way it was
[1:25:05] spoken by a prophet.
[1:25:08] That's right. It's gotten to where men
[1:25:10] don't know what a man is. Don't even
[1:25:13] know what bathroom to use.
[1:25:18] Say, "How did it happen?" I tell you how
[1:25:20] it happened. Was it just an accident,
[1:25:21] Brother Matt? You know, just a just, you
[1:25:23] know, a low time in history. No,
[1:25:25] friends. It was actually prophesied. If
[1:25:27] you go back and study the seven visions
[1:25:28] brother Brandham had, it was the fifth
[1:25:30] vision that he actually seen the
[1:25:32] mistaken identity of men and women.
[1:25:36] And he said the woman got out of her
[1:25:38] place. And he said the man is out of his
[1:25:40] place. He's she's wearing he's wearing
[1:25:42] his she he's wearing her underneath
[1:25:44] garments.
[1:25:46] That's shorts in case you didn't know
[1:25:48] that.
[1:25:50] Uh oh. Brother Matt, you got to preach
[1:25:51] on shorts. I'm not talking about YouTube
[1:25:53] shorts.
[1:25:58] He says, "She's wearing," and let me
[1:25:59] tell you what a prophet said. A prophet
[1:26:00] said, "The only man that'll put those on
[1:26:02] is a sissy."
[1:26:05] Amen. So, Brother Tim told me years ago,
[1:26:07] he told the young people, "I don't mind
[1:26:08] if you wear your shorts. Just put your
[1:26:10] britches on over them before you walk
[1:26:11] outside."
[1:26:14] You say, "Oh, brother Matt, do do you
[1:26:16] believe that?" Yeah. I'm happen to be
[1:26:18] one of those who believe, as Jesus said,
[1:26:19] "Oh, fools and slow of heart to believe
[1:26:22] all."
[1:26:23] Somebody say, "All that the prophets
[1:26:26] have spoken." I happen to be one of
[1:26:28] those who happen to believe. All that
[1:26:30] the prophets have spoken.
[1:26:32] [Applause]
[1:26:33] And a man ought to be a man. He ought
[1:26:35] not to be wearing those shorts out
[1:26:37] in public. Well, I'm just playing
[1:26:38] basketball, brother Matt. I'm just
[1:26:40] playing, you know, sports. Listen, I I'm
[1:26:42] talking about a Shadrach, Meshach, and
[1:26:44] Abedneo that where the rest of the world
[1:26:46] was going one way, they were not afraid
[1:26:48] to stick out. They were not afraid to
[1:26:50] stand up. They were not afraid to say,
[1:26:52] "I'm not ashamed. I won't compromise. I
[1:26:55] won't make
[1:26:57] excuses. I've got a conviction to stand
[1:26:59] for the word of
[1:27:04] God. Don't know what a man is. Don't
[1:27:07] know what a This is prophesied in the
[1:27:10] fifth vision. In fact, it would go worse
[1:27:12] than that to where men doesn't know what
[1:27:15] in so much that brother Brandham would
[1:27:16] say like this. He says, "Where's man
[1:27:19] that stands for a principle? If he's a
[1:27:21] president, where's our John Quincy
[1:27:24] Adams? Where's our Abraham
[1:27:27] Lincoln's men of principle?"
[1:27:32] Where's our Patrick Henry that said,
[1:27:35] "Give me liberty
[1:27:38] or give me death."
[1:27:43] And I'm afraid some of us would quicker
[1:27:47] deny and and compromise the truth if it
[1:27:51] meant it lost we lost our house.
[1:27:55] It's true. Amen. We live in an age to
[1:27:59] where I wonder if some people would
[1:28:00] still stand for the truth if it meant
[1:28:03] they lost their home or their job or
[1:28:05] their career.
[1:28:07] What about losing your life? Yeah.
[1:28:11] Come on. I'm talking about people that
[1:28:13] could literally not count their lives as
[1:28:16] worth anything outside of the stand they
[1:28:19] took for Jesus Christ. The Bible says
[1:28:21] they love their lives not unto death.
[1:28:25] Men of principle who stood for the word
[1:28:27] of God. Didn't matter what it cost them.
[1:28:30] Didn't matter who turned against them.
[1:28:32] Sometimes, friend, the greatest thing
[1:28:34] you'll ever have to do is stand your
[1:28:36] ground when you're all by yourself. and
[1:28:39] the whole world walks away from you. And
[1:28:41] your mom walks away, your dad walks
[1:28:43] away, and you're the only person
[1:28:45] standing. Well, I got news. You're not
[1:28:47] the only one standing, but there's a
[1:28:49] host of angels that are encamped about
[1:28:52] you, that are pushing and pulling for
[1:28:54] you. There's a God who'll never leave
[1:29:01] you. Regardless of the whole world,
[1:29:04] Brother Brandham says, where's a man
[1:29:06] that stands for what's right? Where's a
[1:29:09] man that's not afraid to speak out
[1:29:12] regardless
[1:29:13] if the whole world's against him? Speak
[1:29:17] out for what's right and stand for it
[1:29:19] and die for it.
[1:29:23] Where's our Arnold von Winker right
[1:29:25] again today? Where is men of integrity?
[1:29:29] Where is men with spirit?
[1:29:34] Oh, I feel this right now, my brother,
[1:29:36] my sister. Where is man with spirit,
[1:29:40] with
[1:29:41] passion that's not afraid to take a
[1:29:43] stand for the Lord?
[1:29:46] Where is men who stands for the truth of
[1:29:49] God's word and won't compromise for any
[1:29:52] amount of money, for any amount of
[1:29:54] success, for any amount of comfort in
[1:29:56] life?
[1:29:59] Where's men with spirit? They're so
[1:30:01] wishy-washy until they don't know where
[1:30:04] they stand. True. Amen. Yeah. Preaching
[1:30:07] to you today on standing up to your
[1:30:09] bully.
[1:30:12] And the prophet of God would say this,
[1:30:13] and I just want to take just a turn
[1:30:15] here. Can you go with me?
[1:30:17] You see, it was actually prophesied.
[1:30:20] This was actually prophesied in our
[1:30:23] generation that the Bible says that
[1:30:25] there would come a day when people could
[1:30:28] not endure sound doctrine. That's
[1:30:31] right. Amen. That they literally could
[1:30:35] not take preaching the truth.
[1:30:40] That they would turn the truth unto
[1:30:43] fables. The Bible says with itching ears
[1:30:47] they would heap unto themselves
[1:30:49] teachers.
[1:30:51] And what does people do today? Who's
[1:30:53] their teacher? www.google.com.
[1:30:58] Come on. I wonder what Google says about
[1:31:01] brother Brandham. Come on. I wonder what
[1:31:04] Google says about Well, I tell you what.
[1:31:06] I wonder what Google You want to go that
[1:31:08] route. Go find out what Google says
[1:31:09] about Jesus. Go find out about what
[1:31:12] Jesus said what what Google says about
[1:31:14] Paul. I'm going to tell you friends what
[1:31:15] you'll find. You'll find a bottomless
[1:31:17] pit of doubt and fear and faithlessness
[1:31:20] and unbelief that won't lead you to any
[1:31:22] answers. It won't lead you in any solid
[1:31:24] ground. It'll lead you down a path that
[1:31:26] goes for Listen friends, it'll take you
[1:31:28] further than you could ever imagine.
[1:31:32] Yes, sir. You want to talk about facts
[1:31:34] and what Google says? Listen, friends, I
[1:31:37] don't need to know what Google says. The
[1:31:39] greatest proof that I have that the
[1:31:41] message of the hour is a message from
[1:31:43] the throne. It's not what I read. It's
[1:31:45] not what I hear. It's what I live and
[1:31:48] what's what it's done in my own
[1:31:52] life. That's the proof of the message of
[1:31:55] the hour is that it changes me into the
[1:31:58] image of this word.
[1:32:04] But it would become such a day and it
[1:32:07] would become to the place and brother
[1:32:09] Bham says that he says I prophesy to you
[1:32:13] in the name of the Lord the world will
[1:32:16] go
[1:32:17] completely insane
[1:32:21] and you are living in Satan's Eden in
[1:32:24] the darkest age to where men have become
[1:32:28] lovers of their own self.
[1:32:32] I'm just preaching this. I'm just
[1:32:34] feeling the Holy Spirit right now. Men
[1:32:36] will become lovers of their own self.
[1:32:39] What does that mean, brother Matt? That
[1:32:40] they stand in the mirror and go, "Oh,
[1:32:42] look at
[1:32:44] me." I hope nobody does that.
[1:32:48] But lover of your own self actually just
[1:32:51] means that you exalt what you research,
[1:32:54] what you think critically, what you
[1:32:57] rationalize, what you reason with that
[1:32:59] you exalt that so high above the
[1:33:02] knowledge of truth that men have became
[1:33:05] such lovers of their own self.
[1:33:08] This is the age of self. It's the age of
[1:33:11] selflove.
[1:33:13] And the B and brother Bam says what was
[1:33:15] it? It was a spirit that would come on
[1:33:17] the age. It was a spirit that would
[1:33:19] become not just a spirit, a demon
[1:33:22] spirit, but it would actually be an
[1:33:25] anointing that colored an entire group,
[1:33:27] an entire age of people.
[1:33:30] You see, there's an anointing upon this
[1:33:33] age. In the book of Revelations, chapter
[1:33:35] nine, I I think this is so powerful. If
[1:33:38] you got if you got the slide, you can go
[1:33:40] ahead and put it up. Listen to what John
[1:33:42] Wesley says here. John Wesley says this,
[1:33:44] and I thought this was just such a
[1:33:46] powerful statement. He says here, I'm
[1:33:48] just waiting for the brother to get it
[1:33:50] up. If you if you got that, good. If
[1:33:52] not, if it don't work, don't even worry
[1:33:53] about it. You got that on the screen.
[1:33:55] I'm just going to read it to you. John
[1:33:56] Wesley says, "What one generation
[1:33:59] tolerates, listen to this. What one
[1:34:03] generation
[1:34:04] tolerates, the next
[1:34:07] generation will embrace."
[1:34:10] I'm going to say that again. what one
[1:34:13] generation tolerates. Remember how
[1:34:15] brother Brandham said in the church age
[1:34:16] and in the seals he said that it started
[1:34:18] out as a saying, right? Then it moved
[1:34:21] from that and the people got a little
[1:34:23] bit more used to it, a little bit more
[1:34:24] used to it and then it became a doctrine
[1:34:27] and it was crowned eventually became the
[1:34:29] un un you know controvertible
[1:34:32] unnegotiable non-arguable dogma. But it
[1:34:36] starts as just a saying. It starts
[1:34:38] that's how the devil starts in your
[1:34:39] life. He starts with just a saying and
[1:34:42] then before long you tolerate him long
[1:34:44] enough and long enough and long enough
[1:34:45] before you know it he's in control of
[1:34:47] your whole life.
[1:34:49] And Wesley says what one generation
[1:34:52] tolerates the next generation will
[1:34:55] embrace. You got that brother? Can you
[1:34:58] can you display that? You going to be
[1:34:59] able to get it or no? It's okay. It's
[1:35:01] all right. I emailed it over to where
[1:35:03] Mike said that's okay. Lord knows. I
[1:35:06] want you to notice this because actually
[1:35:08] if you study your Bible and look in
[1:35:10] Revelations chapter 9, thank you. You
[1:35:12] look in Revelations chapter nine, it
[1:35:15] talks about these 200 million demons,
[1:35:18] spirits, chargers. Now remember, brother
[1:35:20] Brandham said these were not natural
[1:35:21] horses, though they had breastplates,
[1:35:24] though they had all these colors and
[1:35:25] they had fire breathing the out of the
[1:35:28] horse's mouth. But the prophet of God
[1:35:30] said these were demon chargers that were
[1:35:34] held at the river Euphrates. Now listen
[1:35:37] to me young people just here for a
[1:35:39] moment because the prophet of God says
[1:35:41] notice where Euphrates river is. If you
[1:35:43] ever look on a map you'll find that you
[1:35:46] that there was three rivers the Tigris
[1:35:48] the Nile and the Euphrates. And actually
[1:35:50] it's the Mesopotamia that Abraham comes
[1:35:53] from. Meso means between Patamia the
[1:35:56] rivers. And so Abraham actually came
[1:35:58] from this land over the Euphrates.
[1:36:01] Sojourned into what we call Judea, the
[1:36:03] Judean Valley or what's known as modern
[1:36:06] Israel. And I want you to notice this
[1:36:08] here because this is what the spirit,
[1:36:11] the Bible prophesies that at the river
[1:36:14] Euphrates. So what's on the other side
[1:36:17] of the Euphrates? Israel, the land of
[1:36:20] Judea. This is what the Bible depicts. I
[1:36:23] just used chat GPT for a really good
[1:36:25] purpose.
[1:36:27] You could use this for some really bad
[1:36:29] purposes. I love it when it gives me
[1:36:30] some good answers. I was talking to her
[1:36:33] the other day and I I said, "Hey, tell
[1:36:34] me what, you know, can you tell me how
[1:36:36] many genders there are?" Man, it showed
[1:36:38] its true colors,
[1:36:39] buddy. It showed its true colors. Oh,
[1:36:42] well, gender is, you know, a very
[1:36:44] subjective topic. And you you could talk
[1:36:46] to it now and very subjective. And you
[1:36:48] got to understand that there's all kinds
[1:36:49] of I said, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[1:36:50] whoa, whoa. I just interrupt. Hold on a
[1:36:52] minute. If I was to bring someone back
[1:36:54] from 150 years ago and I was to ask them
[1:36:57] the question how many genders there are,
[1:36:59] what would they answer? Here was his
[1:37:01] answer. Well, hypothetically, if you
[1:37:04] were to take someone back from 150 years
[1:37:06] ago, no doubt they would answer that
[1:37:08] there's only two
[1:37:10] genders. But I said, "No, no, no, no,
[1:37:12] no, no, no butts. I don't want to hear
[1:37:14] anything else. I already got my answer."
[1:37:19] You see, if you would ask someone,
[1:37:20] "What's changed?" God hasn't changed.
[1:37:22] His word hasn't changed. His standard
[1:37:24] hasn't changed. The message hasn't
[1:37:27] changed. The only thing that's changed
[1:37:29] is
[1:37:32] them. And so, notice this was I said,
[1:37:35] "Chad, give me a a picture, a depiction
[1:37:38] of Revelations 9," Brother Brandham says
[1:37:39] in Revelations chapter 9, 13th verse,
[1:37:42] notice under the sixth trumpet.
[1:37:44] Revelations 9:13 under the sixth
[1:37:46] trumpet. Note there was 200,000 that
[1:37:48] were had been bound in the river
[1:37:50] Euphrates was turned loose under the
[1:37:52] sixth trumpet. It wasn't natural horses.
[1:37:54] They breathed fire at breastplates of
[1:37:56] jasper. Had tails and at the end of the
[1:37:58] tail looked like a serpent, a snake's
[1:38:00] head on the end of it stinging. See, it
[1:38:02] was spiritual horses, spiritual devils,
[1:38:05] chargers that had been bound. Notice if
[1:38:08] you read Revelations 9, it says they
[1:38:11] were held until a certain day, a certain
[1:38:14] hour, a certain moment. Yeah. In other
[1:38:17] words, this wasn't random. This wasn't
[1:38:19] just happen stance, just whatever. But
[1:38:21] God knew the very moment that these
[1:38:24] spirits, these chargers would be
[1:38:26] released. The prophet of God said, "I'll
[1:38:28] release under that sixth trumpet." So
[1:38:30] notice here there was demon spirits
[1:38:33] bound, waiting, wanting, desiring to
[1:38:37] cross the Euphrates. What's on the other
[1:38:39] side of the Euphrates? Israel.
[1:38:43] Say why, brother Matt? Does Satan hate
[1:38:47] Israel? Is it the Hebrew language? No.
[1:38:51] Is it the long, you know, tassels that
[1:38:52] they wear down the some of the acidic
[1:38:54] Jews? No, it ain't got nothing to do
[1:38:55] with Is it their skin color? Why does
[1:38:58] the devil hate? He could pick on
[1:38:59] anybody. He could attack anybody. Yeah.
[1:39:02] But the entire world is against this
[1:39:04] little bitty tiny insignificant
[1:39:07] seemingly country called Israel. Come
[1:39:12] on. You can pick on the rest of the
[1:39:13] world, but you're going to single out
[1:39:15] one. Is it their language? Is it their
[1:39:17] skin color? Is it the name? No, brother.
[1:39:19] I'm going to tell you one very simple
[1:39:21] reason why the devil hates Israel. It's
[1:39:23] because God loves Israel.
[1:39:26] I said there's one reason. Because God
[1:39:28] said, "I chose you above every nation,
[1:39:32] above every people, above every tongue.
[1:39:34] It didn't have to do with your worth. It
[1:39:36] didn't have to do with your behavior.
[1:39:38] It's election." That election might
[1:39:40] stand. God has chosen Israel. And you'll
[1:39:42] never make sense out of predestination.
[1:39:44] You'll say, "Why didn't God choose them?
[1:39:46] Why did God choose me?" It's fair. It's
[1:39:48] not about fair or unfair. It's about
[1:39:50] elective love. And you ought to just
[1:39:52] say, "Thank you, God, that I'm part of
[1:39:54] the family of God. Thank you that
[1:39:56] election has stood for
[1:39:59] me. That's why the devil hates Israel
[1:40:03] because they're a tiny little nation.
[1:40:05] And if you didn't know this, then
[1:40:07] nothing of what you see in the world
[1:40:09] would make any sense. That's right. How
[1:40:11] is it, brother Timothy, that that that
[1:40:13] deans of colleges, professors,
[1:40:17] schools,
[1:40:19] governments, how is it hearing a senator
[1:40:21] up just a little while ago saying that
[1:40:24] we ought to we ought to consider cutting
[1:40:26] all support for
[1:40:27] Israel unless they line up and do what
[1:40:30] the you do what do what we're telling
[1:40:32] them recommending them to do it. You
[1:40:33] say, how would it be that men here was
[1:40:36] men? These weren't these weren't
[1:40:38] monsters. They were they were under a
[1:40:40] spirit. But how did these men get in
[1:40:43] their cars, get in their vehicles, and
[1:40:45] invade that land and kill mothers and
[1:40:48] kill babies?
[1:40:51] Say, "I can't make any sense of it,
[1:40:52] brother Matt. I'll tell you, there's
[1:40:53] only one thing that'll make sense, and
[1:40:55] that's this prophecy in Revelations
[1:40:57] chapter 9." And a vindicated prophet
[1:40:59] said, "There's a modern event. It'll be
[1:41:01] made clear by prophecy." You won't be
[1:41:03] able to make sense out of this world.
[1:41:05] Friend, listen. Without the message of
[1:41:06] the hour, the light from the throne of
[1:41:08] God, you will never make sense in the
[1:41:10] world. There's only one that I'm so glad
[1:41:13] I've got a vindicated message that I
[1:41:15] don't have to question. I don't have to
[1:41:17] wonder what's happening in the world.
[1:41:19] It's already been spoken because listen,
[1:41:21] the White House isn't controlling
[1:41:23] prophecy.
[1:41:25] I'm going to tell you something. It
[1:41:26] don't matter if there's a Trump, if
[1:41:28] there's a Biden. It doesn't Oh, I'm so
[1:41:30] glad. Listen, friends, I'll give you the
[1:41:32] words of a prophet. It doesn't matter if
[1:41:34] you put a George Washington and an
[1:41:36] Abraham Lincoln on every street corner.
[1:41:39] It'll never turn it around.
[1:41:43] You say, "Brother Matt, how why is it
[1:41:44] happening?" I'll tell you why it's
[1:41:46] happening. Because a book that they have
[1:41:48] kicked out of their schools that they
[1:41:50] have been afraid to quote. Because a God
[1:41:53] who revealed himself, they have
[1:41:54] rejected. And it's a book of prophecy.
[1:41:58] That's right. Amen. And he said it'll
[1:42:01] come so much so listen to this that
[1:42:04] those spirits, those chargers, what was
[1:42:07] it? The old Roman Empire being revived,
[1:42:09] the persecution of the Jews been bound
[1:42:11] for nearly 2,000 years at the river
[1:42:13] Euphrates can't cross to the promise.
[1:42:15] Religious sect that was trying to get to
[1:42:17] the other side. Euphrates, you know,
[1:42:18] come through Eden. But they were bound
[1:42:19] there. 200,000 devils of persecution.
[1:42:23] Notice what happens under that sixth
[1:42:25] trumpet. They were turned loose on the
[1:42:27] Jews spiritually. the
[1:42:30] persecution of the Jews, supernatural
[1:42:34] devils nearly 2,000 years then loosed
[1:42:39] notice by Stalin
[1:42:42] Kitner.
[1:42:44] Uhhuh.
[1:42:46] So you mean that what happened in the
[1:42:47] 40s with a little boy from Austria
[1:42:53] and he didn't know that God was
[1:42:56] anointing him listen to fulfill prophecy
[1:43:02] he didn't know but him yielding his
[1:43:04] vessel to the wrong things
[1:43:10] and he grew up to be one of the greatest
[1:43:13] bullies in
[1:43:16] history. Hitler didn't know. Brother
[1:43:18] Brandham says, notice this here, under
[1:43:20] that sixth seal. Listen, we know the
[1:43:23] sixth seal is an interruption of nature.
[1:43:25] Brother Brandham says it's the what is
[1:43:26] it? It's the persecution. It's the
[1:43:29] tribulation. But notice here under that
[1:43:32] sixth seal, you say, "Brother Matt, but
[1:43:33] we're not in the tribulation." You know
[1:43:34] how I know we're not in the tribulation?
[1:43:36] Cuz I'm still here.
[1:43:39] When you get a revelation of that, you
[1:43:41] can you don't have to fear. You don't
[1:43:42] have to go to bed worried at night.
[1:43:43] There's a reason why the rapture hasn't
[1:43:45] happened because I'm still here.
[1:43:49] And notice this here. But the prophet
[1:43:51] says that under that sixth seal, under
[1:43:53] that trumpet, he says it this way in the
[1:43:56] sixth seal that there was released an
[1:43:58] amateur tribulation.
[1:44:01] An amateur
[1:44:03] tribulation. And he anointed men like
[1:44:06] Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini, Ikeman. These
[1:44:10] men didn't know they were coming under
[1:44:12] an anointing to fulfill scripture. That
[1:44:15] under that trumpet there was released a
[1:44:18] power or an anointing that could take a
[1:44:21] man like Hitler and anoint an entire
[1:44:23] world, an entire generation of young
[1:44:27] people. I just want to preach this here
[1:44:28] for a moment that he didn't realize when
[1:44:30] he would speak those words, listen to
[1:44:33] this, when he would get up there with
[1:44:35] his with his sermons, cuz that's what
[1:44:37] they were.
[1:44:39] Listen to me, young people. The devil's
[1:44:41] got a voice.
[1:44:43] I said the devil has a voice. The bully
[1:44:46] has a voice. That's right. And you've
[1:44:49] got to be able to decipher between the
[1:44:52] voice of the bully and the voice of God.
[1:44:55] Amen. You've got to be able to to
[1:44:58] decipher and and identify that's the
[1:45:01] devil. That's the enemy. That's not God.
[1:45:04] That's right.
[1:45:07] And his voice literally became a voice
[1:45:10] of persecution
[1:45:12] that those
[1:45:14] 200,000 chargers that he would get up
[1:45:17] there with microphone, he would take his
[1:45:20] voice. You see, there's something so
[1:45:21] powerful about a voice. That's right.
[1:45:24] There's something so powerful when it
[1:45:26] goes from thought to spoken word
[1:45:30] because words have the power to change
[1:45:33] the atmosphere. Words have the power to
[1:45:36] anoint the wrong thing or the right
[1:45:39] thing.
[1:45:40] Come on, somebody. You with me?
[1:45:43] Words have the when they go into the
[1:45:45] atmosphere and and they didn't realize
[1:45:47] it. But is this man who was under that
[1:45:50] anointing, that sixth seal, destruction,
[1:45:54] torment,
[1:45:55] persecution. Give you the words of
[1:45:57] brother Brandon. He says it in three
[1:45:58] different places. He says, "God cannot
[1:46:01] destroy the world until the world gets
[1:46:04] in the spirit of destruction first."
[1:46:08] Is that what he said?
[1:46:10] He said, "God cannot destroy the world
[1:46:13] until the world gets into the spirit of
[1:46:15] destruction first."
[1:46:18] And so they didn't realize when Hitler
[1:46:21] was speaking those
[1:46:23] words, and I'm going to tell you what
[1:46:24] they were. They were sermons. You can go
[1:46:26] back on artificial intelligence. And
[1:46:28] they have now taken the voice of Hitler
[1:46:31] in that German language, and they've
[1:46:32] kept the tonality of that voice exactly
[1:46:34] as you would hear it, but it's in
[1:46:36] English.
[1:46:39] And you could hear his speeches. And
[1:46:40] I'll tell you what you'll hear. You'll
[1:46:42] hear that he believed he was a prophet.
[1:46:43] Come on now. You might not have realized
[1:46:46] that about Adolf Hitler, but as a little
[1:46:48] boy, an Austrian boy, he starts
[1:46:51] believing that he was a prophet. And he
[1:46:53] prophesied that he would become the
[1:46:55] chancellor of Germany. All right? And he
[1:46:58] stands there in one of his speeches and
[1:47:00] he says, "I prophesied to you." And he
[1:47:02] says, "I'm like a prophet like the Old
[1:47:04] Testament prophets."
[1:47:07] Tell you what he was. He was a false
[1:47:08] prophet.
[1:47:11] And he says, "I'm a prophet." it and he
[1:47:13] says, "I prophesied to you today I will
[1:47:15] become the chancellor of Germany." And
[1:47:17] he gets up there with his words and his
[1:47:20] speeches and he and he didn't realize
[1:47:23] and you know what he did he he takes the
[1:47:25] Bible and he changes the Bible and he be
[1:47:28] creates an Aryan Bible. He takes out
[1:47:30] every reference of the Jews in that
[1:47:33] Bible and he replaces it with Aryans.
[1:47:37] Go read history. This is exactly what he
[1:47:39] did. I tell you what, it ought to be a
[1:47:41] clue to you what the devil's trying to
[1:47:42] do when he tries to change the word and
[1:47:44] water the word down and replace this
[1:47:46] with that. Be careful. Listen, friends,
[1:47:48] there's only one thing that'll set
[1:47:50] people free, and that's if we preach the
[1:47:52] truth of the word of God. You don't need
[1:47:53] to water it. You don't need to mix it.
[1:47:55] You don't need to try to dress it up.
[1:47:57] You don't need to try to modernize it.
[1:47:59] It is it's the truth with the power to
[1:48:01] change a life, but you got to preach it
[1:48:03] the way it was spoken. Oh, do we have a
[1:48:06] generation of young people that'll say,
[1:48:08] "Don't change it. Don't water it down.
[1:48:11] Preach the word of God. Preach the
[1:48:13] message of the hour. Preach it the way a
[1:48:16] prophet spoke it,
[1:48:17] brother. It's the only thing that'll set
[1:48:20] me free."
[1:48:22] Hallelujah. And you didn't realize that
[1:48:25] his words begin to become channeled. And
[1:48:28] an entire generation of young people,
[1:48:33] you go study history. I think it was for
[1:48:36] three years after the surrender and the
[1:48:39] war ended. Three years they had to have
[1:48:41] groups to it was called deprogramming
[1:48:44] the Nazi Hitler youth.
[1:48:48] Cuz he knew if he could capture the
[1:48:50] heart of young people. You see the devil
[1:48:52] knows how valuable you are.
[1:48:56] That's why he wants your standard.
[1:48:58] That's why he wants your dress code.
[1:49:00] That's why he wants your testimony.
[1:49:01] That's why he wants your voice.
[1:49:06] And he literally starts preaching these
[1:49:08] sermons and they didn't realize that his
[1:49:11] voice was created in an anointing that
[1:49:14] came upon people that kept Oh. Oh. But
[1:49:17] there was a there was a man, I love this
[1:49:19] so much. A man named Dedric Bonhifer. He
[1:49:22] was one man in the face of many who
[1:49:24] wasn't going to let the bully just do
[1:49:26] all the talking. He wasn't going to let
[1:49:28] the bully just do all the preaching. He
[1:49:29] was a minister of the gospel who stood
[1:49:32] up and all the priest all those all
[1:49:34] those all those uh you know preachers
[1:49:35] saying oh Dedric don't say nothing you
[1:49:37] got to preach to he came to preach to a
[1:49:39] massive church and he said Dedrick you
[1:49:41] know you have no reason you have a
[1:49:42] family you have children don't try to
[1:49:44] come and get he was privately telling
[1:49:46] them hey this ain't right hey this ain't
[1:49:48] right you can't just let this guy run up
[1:49:50] this guy will take over the whole world
[1:49:51] he'll destroy us all oh you know but
[1:49:53] here was the problem everybody was
[1:49:55] accepting it everybody was doing it so
[1:49:57] because everybody was doing it that must
[1:49:59] mean that it's what we should do. No,
[1:50:00] friends, it does not always. Just
[1:50:02] because the crowd's doing it, just
[1:50:03] sometimes the majority doing it is the
[1:50:06] very evidence that tells you you should
[1:50:07] go the other way. If the rest of the
[1:50:10] world is going that way, that ought to
[1:50:11] tell you you should run the other
[1:50:13] direction.
[1:50:15] Yes, sir. Dedric, don't say anything.
[1:50:17] Just just just, you know, just preach a
[1:50:18] nice little sermon. Just get up there
[1:50:20] and you know, you don't need to say
[1:50:21] anything. Yeah. What what is it? What
[1:50:23] really? This is what they told him. You
[1:50:24] know what's it? Look at what it would
[1:50:26] cost you if you get up and speak against
[1:50:29] the furer. Don't you know what's going
[1:50:31] to happen to you? This is what Dedric
[1:50:33] said. Silence in the face of evil is
[1:50:36] evil itself.
[1:50:39] Oh, that ought to raise something up
[1:50:41] inside of a real believer and say,
[1:50:43] "Satan, you done all the talking, but
[1:50:45] I'm going to take the microphone now.
[1:50:47] I'm not going to be silent because
[1:50:49] silence in the face of the evil is evil
[1:50:52] itself. I will stand against you,
[1:50:55] Satan, and I may fall down and I may
[1:50:58] mess up, but I will fight you,
[1:51:04] Satan. Oh, he says, being a Christian, I
[1:51:07] love this so much. Being a Christian is
[1:51:09] less about cautiously avoiding sin than
[1:51:12] about courageously and actively doing
[1:51:16] God's will.
[1:51:18] Oh, if we'd let some of that faith rub
[1:51:20] on us this morning, you wouldn't let the
[1:51:22] devil back you up into a corner and
[1:51:24] compromise and negotiate a surrender and
[1:51:26] a peace treaty with the devil, you'd get
[1:51:28] some courage about you to say, "Satan,
[1:51:31] you can't have me. You can't have my
[1:51:33] children. You can't have my body. You
[1:51:36] can't have my mind. I'm taking it back
[1:51:38] this morning."
[1:51:40] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:51:42] And he stood up. But those words begin
[1:51:46] to go into the atmosphere. Brother
[1:51:47] Brandham said that they those 200
[1:51:49] million demons that had been bound was
[1:51:51] released upon the Jews. Persecution
[1:51:54] came. Now listen to this because brother
[1:51:57] Adam says notice this here. These men
[1:51:58] didn't realize it. Stalin, Muslim,
[1:52:00] Mussolini, Hitler, Ikeman, and it was an
[1:52:03] amateur tribulation. As he began to say
[1:52:06] those words like a bully and his words
[1:52:10] like Goliath, his words every day, the
[1:52:13] Bible says he'd come out every day and
[1:52:15] say the same thing. I defy the armies of
[1:52:18] the living
[1:52:19] God. Brother said, "But one day those
[1:52:21] words fell on the wrong ears."
[1:52:24] [Music]
[1:52:25] One day those words fell on the wrong
[1:52:27] ears.
[1:52:30] And Hitler takes over, invades Poland.
[1:52:34] They're in Glitchitz, Germany. I was
[1:52:35] there just in Poland just last year. And
[1:52:38] he in one of his last false flags as he
[1:52:40] invades Germany, invades Poland, takes
[1:52:43] over Poland. And then he he he
[1:52:45] steamrolls Poland. Steamrolls France.
[1:52:47] And it just looks like the juggernaut is
[1:52:50] just coming through and he's going to
[1:52:51] wipe everybody out. What do we do,
[1:52:52] Nebuchadnezzar? Just bow down. Just
[1:52:54] everybody bow down. Don't say anything
[1:52:56] against him. Don't make yourself odd.
[1:52:58] You might come out on the better and
[1:53:00] just negotiate a deal with him. You
[1:53:02] know, maybe he'll let us live. What?
[1:53:03] Maybe give us, you know, let us, you
[1:53:05] know, and and they get to the point to
[1:53:07] where these nations are negotiating
[1:53:08] peace treaties and and you know, and a
[1:53:10] surrender and how we're going to do it.
[1:53:12] He's just steamrolling everybody. just
[1:53:14] everybody's everybody's going
[1:53:16] everybody's walking away and here comes
[1:53:20] here comes a man by the name of Winston
[1:53:23] Churchill.
[1:53:25] Now this was a little man not very large
[1:53:28] in stature but he also had a microphone
[1:53:33] and it looked like all Britain was going
[1:53:36] to be taken. France was taken. Poland
[1:53:38] was taken. All of Europe was looked like
[1:53:41] it was going to be steamrolled. But
[1:53:43] something inside of this little man was
[1:53:46] not going to go down without a fight.
[1:53:49] Something inside of this man was not
[1:53:51] going to go down without a fight. He was
[1:53:53] going to make sure that no matter what
[1:53:55] happened, he did not stay silent, but he
[1:53:58] used his voice.
[1:54:00] And he gets on the radio and families
[1:54:02] are scared and mothers are scared and
[1:54:05] boys are scared. He speaks to those boys
[1:54:08] in Dunkirk and you can read about some
[1:54:11] of his most powerful speeches, blood,
[1:54:14] sweat, and tears and our finest hour.
[1:54:16] And he's and he what's he doing? It's an
[1:54:18] anointing because brother Brandon said
[1:54:20] every time those spirits came out
[1:54:22] against God's family, every time there
[1:54:24] went out a challenge and that black
[1:54:26] horse rider and that red horse rider and
[1:54:28] now that pale horse rider, but brother
[1:54:29] Brandon says, "But every single time God
[1:54:32] sent a rider or an anointing to meet and
[1:54:34] to to meet the challenge of the
[1:54:36] generation." Listen friends, God is not
[1:54:38] without a voice. God is not without a
[1:54:41] defense. God is not just going to back
[1:54:43] down or retreat or run away. He's going
[1:54:46] to have somebody to take a stand against
[1:54:48] the
[1:54:54] devil. And John F. Kennedy said
[1:54:56] something so powerful about him. He
[1:54:58] says, "You know
[1:55:00] what? I love this. Church Hill didn't
[1:55:03] have no
[1:55:04] army. He didn't have no army. He didn't
[1:55:08] have horses. He didn't have He didn't
[1:55:10] have tanks. He didn't have He had them,
[1:55:11] but not nearly the power. He was
[1:55:15] outnumbered 10 to one. What you gonna
[1:55:18] do, Church Hill? I mean, come on. It's a
[1:55:20] It's a matter of impossibility. You know
[1:55:22] what John F. Kennedy said about Church
[1:55:25] Hill? He said he had no army. So, he
[1:55:27] took the English language and he
[1:55:30] weaponized words and he sent them into
[1:55:33] battle.
[1:55:37] You see how powerful your words are? You
[1:55:40] say, "I might not have much." Yeah, but
[1:55:41] you got a voice.
[1:55:43] Yes, sir. Do you know victory has a
[1:55:46] voice?
[1:55:48] I said victory has a voice. Defeat also
[1:55:52] has a voice, but victory has another
[1:55:54] voice that'll speak in the face of
[1:55:56] defeat.
[1:55:59] And he said he didn't have no army. He
[1:56:01] didn't have no tanks. So he took a
[1:56:03] microphone. He gets behind that BBC
[1:56:06] microphone on the radio broadcast and he
[1:56:09] starts speaking words and his voice
[1:56:12] starts to listen. People start to hear
[1:56:14] it. Families that are backed down.
[1:56:16] Families that are in fear. Soldiers that
[1:56:18] are in fear. I love this so much.
[1:56:20] Soldiers that are in fear. I'm going to
[1:56:22] read you one of his most powerful
[1:56:24] speeches. Can I get five more minutes
[1:56:25] and then we'll close. My timer has went
[1:56:28] off. We are in eternity now.
[1:56:31] Hallelujah.
[1:56:33] And notice here's what's one of his most
[1:56:35] powerful speeches. He comes. Now listen,
[1:56:38] this is perhaps one of the most famous,
[1:56:40] but I'm going to tell you something
[1:56:41] about it. It wasn't broadcast actually
[1:56:43] to the whole world. In fact, it wasn't
[1:56:45] address given to the nation. It was
[1:56:47] actually to the House of Common. This
[1:56:49] was to soldiers. You see, there's a
[1:56:52] message that the whole world hears, but
[1:56:54] then there's a message that's for you
[1:56:56] and you only.
[1:57:00] That's
[1:57:01] right. The whole world may not hear it.
[1:57:05] Might be black hawk helicopter. Listen,
[1:57:06] for all we know right now, there's a
[1:57:08] meeting somewhere in Washington and
[1:57:10] there's blackhawk helicopters. We're
[1:57:11] about Listen, friends, I'm being honest.
[1:57:12] It might be happening right now with
[1:57:14] Iran. You know what though? None of us
[1:57:16] know about it. You know who knows about
[1:57:17] it? Those who are on a need to know
[1:57:19] basis know about it. And let me tell you
[1:57:21] something about the coming of the Lord.
[1:57:23] The whole world may not know about it,
[1:57:24] but there's those who are on a need to
[1:57:27] know basis. And when you need to know
[1:57:29] it, God will reveal
[1:57:32] it.
[1:57:35] Hallelujah. May look like the rest of
[1:57:37] the world's just going on about life,
[1:57:39] but there's a bride getting ready to get
[1:57:41] out of here. There's an army getting
[1:57:44] ready to rise up.
[1:57:48] I'm on a need to know basis.
[1:57:56] Church Hill got behind that microphone.
[1:57:57] He said, "I want to hear I want you to
[1:57:59] hear my
[1:58:00] words." I want you to hear my words. I
[1:58:03] can imagine those boys 18, 19 years old
[1:58:07] as they tuned into the radio. You see,
[1:58:09] there's something powerful about wave
[1:58:11] and sound waves. Brother Brandham says
[1:58:13] when voices go out, he says it circles
[1:58:15] the earth. When the voice of Jesus went
[1:58:17] out and said, "Whatsoever you bind on
[1:58:20] earth shall be bound in heaven." and
[1:58:21] whatsoever you loose shall be loosed in
[1:58:23] heaven. Jes, the Bible says that lay
[1:58:25] your hands upon the sick, they shall
[1:58:27] recover. And brother Brandham says,
[1:58:29] notice in leadership, those voices
[1:58:30] circle the earth. They're sound waves.
[1:58:33] They never die. And they're waiting to
[1:58:35] catch a heart. They're waiting to
[1:58:37] influence somebody, somebody who can
[1:58:40] hear those words.
[1:58:44] And his words enter the atmosphere
[1:58:46] because victory has a voice.
[1:58:50] And that voice begin to speak in that
[1:58:52] little ready go. And this is one of the
[1:58:54] most powerful speeches. Oh, I feel you.
[1:58:58] Forgive me if I'm extra passionate right
[1:59:00] now because I'm not thinking of Church
[1:59:02] Hill. I'm not thinking of Great Britain.
[1:59:04] I'm not thinking of Hitler's army. I'm
[1:59:06] thinking about cancer. I'm thinking
[1:59:08] about demons. I'm thinking about
[1:59:09] depression. I'm thinking about anxiety.
[1:59:17] I'm thinking about the bully that wants
[1:59:19] to destroy you and take your home and
[1:59:21] take your family. But I got news, Satan.
[1:59:24] I resist you. I resist you in the name
[1:59:27] of the Lord. I resist you, cancer. I
[1:59:30] resist you,
[1:59:32] anxiety. I resist you,
[1:59:36] depression. I will not let hell run my
[1:59:40] life. I will not let hell control my
[1:59:44] narrative. I will speak the word of God.
[1:59:47] I will speak faith in the house of
[1:59:56] God. Churchill says he gets on that
[1:59:59] microphone and he begins to send out his
[2:00:02] voice. He says, "Even
[2:00:07] though, oh, I could imagine the
[2:00:10] fear." Could imagine the
[2:00:14] insurmountable
[2:00:16] odds of that doctor report. I could
[2:00:19] imagine the insurmountable odds. Your
[2:00:22] family left, your daddy left, your mama
[2:00:26] left, your pastor don't know what he
[2:00:28] believes now. And it's just you and you
[2:00:31] got to stand. And there's a burning
[2:00:33] fiery furnace. It's heated seven times
[2:00:36] more hot than it's ever been heated
[2:00:38] before.
[2:00:39] And Satan's threats and his
[2:00:43] intimidation. Could imagine how scary of
[2:00:46] a moment it was. So soldiers there. But
[2:00:49] here was a voice that was going to
[2:00:52] change the atmosphere. Hallelujah.
[2:00:56] And Church Hill begins to speak and he
[2:00:59] says, "Even though large tracks of
[2:01:02] Europe and many old and famous states
[2:01:06] have fallen or may fall into the grip of
[2:01:11] the Gestapo and the Audius apparatus of
[2:01:14] Nazi rule." Here's what I got to say to
[2:01:17] that. We shall not fail.
[2:01:23] I got news for the devil. Even though
[2:01:25] many have walked away from the message,
[2:01:27] even though many old churches and
[2:01:29] preachers have compromised and watered
[2:01:32] down the word of God, we will not fail.
[2:01:35] We will not flag. We will not water it
[2:01:38] down. We will not
[2:01:43] compromise. A million may fall at your
[2:01:46] side, a thousand at their side, but it
[2:01:48] won't come unto you.
[2:01:54] They may fall into the grip of the Nazi
[2:01:57] rule. Churchill says, "We shall go on to
[2:02:02] the end.
[2:02:04] We shall fight in France. We shall fight
[2:02:07] in the seas and the oceans. We shall
[2:02:10] fight with growing confidence and
[2:02:12] growing strength in the air. We shall
[2:02:15] defend our island."
[2:02:18] [Applause]
[2:02:20] Churchill says, "Whatever the cost may
[2:02:23] be, I want to tell the devil and I want
[2:02:25] to make sure he hears me. I will fight
[2:02:28] you at home. I will fight you on my
[2:02:30] knees. I will fight you on the internet.
[2:02:33] I will fight you in my
[2:02:36] school. I'll fight you in the pullpit.
[2:02:39] I'll fight you in the hospital room. I
[2:02:42] will never stop, Satan.
[2:02:48] [Music]
[2:02:51] We shall fight. But here's what he says.
[2:02:53] I want to make sure you hear me, Satan.
[2:02:55] We shall never
[2:02:58] surrender. Never. Never. Never never
[2:03:00] never
[2:03:01] never
[2:03:04] surrender. You ought to let hell hear
[2:03:06] your voice today. Satan, I made a fall.
[2:03:09] I made a mistake. I may have a lot of
[2:03:12] failures, but I want you to hear me
[2:03:14] clear. I'm never going to quit. I'm
[2:03:16] never going to stop. I'm never going to
[2:03:18] stop swinging the sword.
[2:03:22] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:03:30] We shall never surrender.
[2:03:34] What Churchill says, "And even if which
[2:03:38] I do not for a moment believe this
[2:03:41] island or a large part of it were
[2:03:43] subjugated and starving, then our empire
[2:03:47] beyond the seas, armed and guarded by
[2:03:51] the British fleet." I love this. Would
[2:03:54] carry on the struggle until good time,
[2:03:58] God's good time. the new world with all
[2:04:01] its might and with all its power steps
[2:04:04] forth to the rescue and the liberation
[2:04:07] of the old. In other words, what he was
[2:04:09] saying is that even if I here's what my
[2:04:11] confidence is, Satan, you got a great
[2:04:13] big old army, but I want to show you. Go
[2:04:15] to that last slide, brother. There might
[2:04:17] be a great big army, but there's a
[2:04:18] greater host of heaven. There's an army
[2:04:21] of angels.
[2:04:27] You see, the Bible numbered the 200
[2:04:29] million, but my Bible says there's not a
[2:04:32] number to the angels. It's an
[2:04:34] innumerable army of host. Oh, he's the
[2:04:37] God of angel armies. He'll fight your
[2:04:42] battles. Oh, I'm thankful for a man
[2:04:44] named Stall. I'm thankful for a man
[2:04:46] named Churchill who used his microphone.
[2:04:48] But can I tell you, go back, brother.
[2:04:50] Can I tell you about another voice that
[2:04:52] cried out in this generation? Can I tell
[2:04:55] you about another microphone?
[2:05:01] Hallelujah. And those words are weapons
[2:05:05] to fight the devil with. Take the sword
[2:05:08] of the spirit and slay your bully
[2:05:12] today. Oh, everybody stand and give God
[2:05:17] praise. Hallelujah.
[2:05:21] Thank you
[2:05:23] Jesus. Thank you
[2:05:34] Lord. Hallelujah. Keep praising his name
[2:05:37] this
[2:05:39] morning. Amen.
[2:05:42] Amen. You've been equipped to fight the
[2:05:44] devil.
[2:05:46] Hallelujah. What will your voice this
[2:05:48] say this morning?
[2:05:50] What will your voice
[2:05:52] say? Can you say, "I just want to speak
[2:05:55] the name of
[2:05:56] [Music]
[2:05:59] Jesus
[2:06:01] over heart and
[2:06:05] [Music]

[2:06:22] Jesus. Say, I just want to speak. And I
[2:06:26] just want to speak the name of Jesus.
[2:06:32] Every dark addiction, every dark
[2:06:35] addiction starts to break.
[2:06:39] I'm going to declare that there's hope.
[2:06:42] There is hope. Oh, and there is freedom.
[2:06:47] Say I speak Jesus.
[2:06:55] Oh, your name is
[2:06:59] power. Your name is
[2:07:03] healing. Your name is love.

[2:07:59] I'm going to go make a stand? Said, I
[2:08:02] just want to speak the name of Jesus.

[2:22:29] just using his his vessel to speak words
[2:22:32] of life again. And Amen. And what a
[2:22:35] wonderful, wonderful service we've
[2:22:37] had. Amen. I know we have a lot of
[2:22:39] activities and things going on. We
[2:22:43] have a moment to
[2:22:46] uh just make a couple of announcements
[2:22:48] if you don't mind just having a seat
[2:22:49] just for just for a few minutes.
[2:22:53] And uh just wanted to say we have
[2:23:01] um we have a a nine square that was set
[2:23:04] up back over here. Just wanted to ask
[2:23:07] everyone please don't hang on that or
[2:23:09] pull on it or anything. We don't
[2:23:11] certainly don't want to break anything
[2:23:13] or intentionally hurt anything. I know
[2:23:15] that wouldn't be our intention, but try
[2:23:17] to treat those things well. We also have
[2:23:20] a time of canoeing and kaying that's
[2:23:23] coming up between 1:30 and 3:30. That's
[2:23:26] something the camp pier has offered for
[2:23:28] us to do. They will have their own staff
[2:23:30] out there as lifeguards. Ask that you
[2:23:32] please be respectful to whatever they um
[2:23:35] ask us to do. We want to show them the
[2:23:39] love and and appreciation that we have
[2:23:41] for the camp staff here. So, that'll be
[2:23:44] from 1:30 to 3:30. And uh we just ask
[2:23:46] that you please go directly there. It's
[2:23:48] going to be down this road and just a
[2:23:50] little to the side. So, it's not on the
[2:23:52] main camping area. So, please don't veer
[2:23:54] off from that. We also don't certainly
[2:23:57] don't want anybody intentionally tipping
[2:23:59] a canoe or rough housing. We just want
[2:24:01] it to be a time of of good fellowship
[2:24:04] together. So, please uh again, just just
[2:24:07] treat that respectfully. And if you want
[2:24:08] to spend some time doing that, would
[2:24:10] love for you to be a part. Just do it
[2:24:13] with the right attitude and the right
[2:24:14] atmosphere. We also um have some drink
[2:24:18] stations that are set up around here. It
[2:24:20] is hot and even though the temperature
[2:24:22] on your phone might not say that it's
[2:24:24] 115°, it is humid and hot and you can
[2:24:27] easily get dehydrated quickly and get
[2:24:30] short of breath quickly. So, please stay
[2:24:32] hydrated this afternoon. Drink plenty of
[2:24:34] water. If you feel at all like you're
[2:24:36] thirsty, please go find something, get
[2:24:38] in the shade, get some water in you. We
[2:24:40] don't want you to get
[2:24:41] overheated. Um we also have some time of
[2:24:44] practice. So, if I have spoken with you
[2:24:46] or Brother Timothy has spoken with you
[2:24:47] about practicing today, that will be
[2:24:49] just from 1 to 2:00. We're not going to
[2:24:52] have practice open all day. So, I might
[2:24:54] have given you an exact time to be here.
[2:24:56] Please make sure you're here at that
[2:24:57] time to practice your special. We will
[2:24:59] have the group from Dallas dismissing
[2:25:01] first so that they can practice
[2:25:03] immediately after lunch at 1:00. So,
[2:25:05] please allow them to get through the
[2:25:06] line and get back to the sanctuary for
[2:25:09] that.
[2:25:12] Um, we also have a few people that have
[2:25:17] um, how many is this your first time
[2:25:19] ever being at this camp? Could you raise
[2:25:21] your hand? I think brother Tim might
[2:25:22] have asked you before. So, we have a few
[2:25:25] people here that have come never been
[2:25:28] here before and we definitely want you
[2:25:30] to feel welcome and loved and some
[2:25:33] people that may
[2:25:34] not have had much of an experience at
[2:25:36] all with the Lord. We hope that'll be
[2:25:38] this weekend. And maybe you have had an
[2:25:41] experience and we want your your life
[2:25:43] and your light to rub off on them as
[2:25:45] well. We have somebody here that many
[2:25:48] years ago when I was a young person many
[2:25:51] years
[2:25:53] ago, he uh came with his uncle and he
[2:25:56] was tricked into
[2:25:57] coming. He was told he was going camping
[2:26:00] over the
[2:26:01] weekend and he showed up to a youth camp
[2:26:03] and didn't know what to expect. And
[2:26:06] maybe you feel like you were tricked
[2:26:08] into coming and you don't know what to
[2:26:10] expect. But I pray this will be a
[2:26:12] weekend when you realize that God has a
[2:26:14] plan for your
[2:26:16] life. And God had a plan for Jeremy's
[2:26:18] life. And I'm going to ask him to come
[2:26:20] pray over the food for us.
[2:26:21] And thankful that he's here many, many
[2:26:25] years later still an example of what God
[2:26:28] can do at this camp.
[2:26:32] Uh, so we we'll have lunch here at
[2:26:34] 12:00. Again, we'll just want you to
[2:26:37] allow those that are practicing to get
[2:26:39] through
[2:26:40] first. I want you to stay on the main
[2:26:43] campgrounds here until 1:30 when they do
[2:26:46] open up for the canoes and kayaks and
[2:26:48] then go together that way. Why don't we
[2:26:51] stand back together and pray together?
[2:26:53] Pray over the food. Pray over the rest
[2:26:55] of the camp.
[2:26:57] I believe God's already moved in a very
[2:26:59] special way in these meetings and he'll
[2:27:01] continue to do it. Just let go and let
[2:27:04] God have your life this weekend. Brother
[2:27:06] Jeremy, if you
[2:27:07] pray, let's bow our
[2:27:11] hearts. Lord, we love you, Father. We
[2:27:13] thank you again, Lord, for this
[2:27:14] opportunity that you've given us, Lord.
[2:27:17] Lord, to come together, Father, Lord,
[2:27:19] young and old, Lord, just to hear from
[2:27:21] you, Lord. We thank you for that. We
[2:27:23] thank you for our brother. We thank you
[2:27:25] that you help move him out of the way
[2:27:27] that you could speak through him. Speak
[2:27:29] right to us, Lord. Give us what we're in
[2:27:31] need of, Father. And I thank you for
[2:27:32] that blessing, Lord. And we ask your
[2:27:34] blessing over this food. We pray it
[2:27:35] gives us strength, nourishment to our
[2:27:38] bodies. We pray you would bless our
[2:27:40] fellowship today, Father. And I pray,
[2:27:41] Lord, that if there's anyone here that
[2:27:43] still has a need in their heart, Lord,
[2:27:45] we know it's not too late. And I pray
[2:27:47] that you would just continue to move
[2:27:49] pieces in place, Lord, that you could
[2:27:51] just work work your perfect will in
[2:27:54] their life. Lord, we love you, Father.
[2:27:55] It's in Jesus name we pray.
[2:27:59] Amen. Amen. And if you are here and
[2:28:02] you're not staying as a camper, we ask
[2:28:04] that you'll let the campers go through
[2:28:05] the lunch line first. If you're not
[2:28:07] staying in one of the the camp dorms or
[2:28:11] one of the rooms as a staff member, but
[2:28:13] you are here for the lunch, please make
[2:28:15] sure you pay at the door for that. that
[2:28:16] as well. We have to tally all of those.
[2:28:19] So hopefully I hit all the
[2:28:20] announcements. If not, I'm sure there
[2:28:21] will be time for more of those. But we
[2:28:23] love you. We want you to have a good
[2:28:25] time. Want you to enjoy your time here
[2:28:27] at Dry Creek Youth Camp. And Amen. Be a
[2:28:31] light shining to all those around you.
[2:28:34] Amen. Amen. Key of G again.
