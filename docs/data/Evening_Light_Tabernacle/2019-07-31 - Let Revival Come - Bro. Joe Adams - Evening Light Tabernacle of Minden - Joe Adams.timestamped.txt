[29:53] time I want to look to the Word of God
[29:55] and trust that something will be said
[29:58] you know as Minister you don't want to
[29:59] speak anything of your own accord you
[30:00] want to speak with the Lord lays upon
[30:01] your heart
[30:02] so tonight by the will of God we will do
[30:04] that with her we're gonna look here in
[30:06] the entire chapter of revelations 5 so
[30:09] verse 1 and I saw in the right hand to
[30:11] him that sat upon the throne a book
[30:13] written within and on the backside
[30:14] sealed with seven seals and I saw a
[30:18] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[30:19] voice who is worthy to open the book in
[30:21] the loose the seals thereof and no man
[30:24] in heaven nor in earth neither under the
[30:26] earth was able to open the book neither
[30:28] to look thereon and I wept much because
[30:31] no man was found worthy to open and to
[30:34] read the book neither to look thereon
[30:35] and one of the elders said unto me weep
[30:37] not behold the Lion of the tribe of
[30:39] Judah the root of David hath prevailed
[30:42] to open the book and to loose the seals
[30:44] thereof and behold I am beheld and I
[30:47] beheld excuse me and lo in the midst of
[30:49] the throne and of the four beasts and in
[30:51] the midst of the elders stood a lamb as
[30:53] it had been slain having seven horns and
[30:56] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[30:57] of God sent forth into all the earth and
[31:00] he came and he took the book out of the
[31:01] right hand to him that sat upon the
[31:03] throne
[31:04] when he had taken the book the four
[31:05] beasts and the four and twenty elders
[31:07] fell down before the lamb having every
[31:09] one of them harps of golden vials full
[31:12] of the odors which are the prayer of the
[31:13] saints and they sung a new song saying
[31:16] about worthy to take the book and to
[31:18] open the seals thereof for that was
[31:20] slain and has redeemed us to God by thy
[31:24] blood out of every kindred and tongue
[31:25] and people and nation and has made us
[31:28] unto our God kings and priests and we
[31:31] shall reign on the earth and I beheld
[31:33] and I heard a voice of many angels round
[31:35] about the throne and the beasts and the
[31:37] elders and the number of them was ten
[31:39] thousand times ten thousands and
[31:41] thousands of thousands saying with a
[31:45] loud voice worthy is a lamb that was
[31:47] slain to receive power and riches and
[31:50] wisdom and strength and honor and glory
[31:52] and blessings and every creature in
[31:55] heaven and on the earth and under the
[31:58] earth such as in the sea and all that
[32:00] are in them heard us saying blessing and
[32:03] honor and glory and power be unto him
[32:06] that sitteth upon the throne and unto
[32:08] the lamb for ever and ever and the four
[32:10] beasts said amen and the four and twenty
[32:12] elders fell down and worshiped him that
[32:16] liveth for ever and ever you can be
[32:18] seated this evening Haman you're glad to
[32:26] be in the house of God this evening we
[32:29] were very fortunate last weekend I got
[32:31] to take my mother-in-law on the trip of
[32:34] a lifetime to Oklahoma and we got there
[32:38] she was she was excited she was gonna be
[32:40] able to go and see the people and visit
[32:42] to church for the very first time and
[32:44] Joseph got sick so she stayed home and
[32:46] babysitting while she stayed at the
[32:49] place we were staying and watched Joseph
[32:51] on we had church so I want to thank you
[32:53] sister Rachel I know you was really had
[32:54] your heart on that but appreciate you
[32:57] and appreciate your testimony if I can
[32:59] get a little bit more volume on these
[33:00] two monitors right here that'll be great
[33:02] but I want to speak to you tonight on
[33:04] it's let revival come now that that word
[33:08] can be taboo in the message that revival
[33:10] come because we think it may sound like
[33:13] as we're waiting on revival to get here
[33:15] when we know that we that the
[33:17] honors in her revival she's received so
[33:19] just by the grace of God tonight give me
[33:21] a little bit of time to explain the
[33:23] thought that I have the adult that the
[33:24] Lord gave me but the word revival comes
[33:27] from the root word revive okay and that
[33:31] word revive means to restore to life to
[33:34] regain life to give new strength or
[33:37] energy to and therefore the word revival
[33:41] actually means the act or the instance
[33:44] of reviving so is the act or the
[33:48] instance of giving life all right have
[33:51] you with me this evening then let's go
[33:53] get together in one heart one Accord now
[33:56] notice here in the word revived the
[33:58] definition has a key word that I want to
[34:00] speak about just for a minute it's a
[34:02] word restore restore to life in the word
[34:05] restore me to put back or to put art to
[34:08] bring back into a former or an original
[34:10] state so we find that revive means to
[34:13] restore back revival is the act of
[34:16] reviving which means restoring back to
[34:20] life therefore we can say that revival
[34:22] tonight is the act of restoring back to
[34:25] the original life not the life that you
[34:29] had when you were born but the life that
[34:31] you had in the very mind of God before
[34:33] you ever committed a sin before you ever
[34:36] committed that first act before you knew
[34:38] anything about sin and unbelief and
[34:41] doubts and all the pressures of life we
[34:43] find the word today means the act of
[34:45] restoring back to the original life that
[34:48] God intended for you to have and so I
[34:52] say let revival come come on Church let
[34:57] revival come let life come tonight let
[35:00] the word come tonight
[35:02] let it come and do more than just
[35:04] tantalize our flesh or excite our
[35:06] emotions but let it change us let it
[35:09] empowers let it charge us tonight
[35:11] let revival come let the life for this
[35:14] message come tonight
[35:15] and excite the body of Christ and we
[35:20] know that there's only one life and that
[35:21] life is a life of Christ so what we're
[35:23] saying is let the original life of
[35:26] Christ be restored to his brow
[35:29] let the original life of Christ his
[35:32] original desire his original thought of
[35:35] you let it be restored to you in your
[35:38] fallen condition you don't have to
[35:40] remain in that condition when God has
[35:43] sent us to work to restore us or revive
[35:46] us back to his original thought so you
[35:51] may say well brother Joe your scripture
[35:52] reading that was kind of off base right
[35:54] revelations 5 let me just go into that
[35:57] John notice now John there was a crime
[36:00] but going out who is worthy to take the
[36:02] book in the loose just seal serve and no
[36:05] man was found worthy so otherwise John
[36:08] in the entire human race they were they
[36:10] were hanging over the balusters who
[36:13] would say that they didn't know if they
[36:14] were in the plan of redemption they
[36:16] didn't know if that wasn't in the plan
[36:17] of redemption okay kill you with me now
[36:20] so we find here there there was a doubt
[36:23] there was an unknown but God provided a
[36:25] land that was worthy to take to boot
[36:28] notice no man was found worthy no
[36:30] prophet was found worthy no priest was
[36:33] found worthy Martin wasn't worthy Luther
[36:36] wasn't worthy Paul wasn't worthy Moses
[36:38] wasn't worthy Enoch wasn't worthy all
[36:41] the great men throughout the ages none
[36:42] of them was worthy William Brandon
[36:44] wasn't worthy but God found a worthy one
[36:47] that could take the book and to loose
[36:48] the seals are us God provided us a lamb
[36:53] God provided us a sacrifice he provided
[36:57] us a substitute and there was only one
[37:03] and the God provided the lamb when we
[37:05] read that the the lamb was worthy and
[37:08] the lamb came out from around the throne
[37:10] and the lamb took the book out of him
[37:12] that said upon the throne and the lamb
[37:14] took the book in revelation 6 we find
[37:17] that the book began to be torn the seals
[37:19] begin to be torn off the book and by by
[37:22] this what do we find that the lamb was
[37:25] in fact restore and fallen man back to
[37:28] eternal life so we can say that the
[37:31] opening of the seventh seal book is what
[37:33] brought revival to the bride
[37:36] so when the lamp took the book and he
[37:39] opened the seals notice now if we go
[37:41] back in Revelations five when he took
[37:43] the book and open the seals there was a
[37:45] revival breakout in heaven well you say
[37:49] brother I don't like me I don't like
[37:50] excitement are you gonna hate heaven
[37:54] you're not gonna be at peace in heaven
[37:56] we're brothers don't not everybody has
[37:58] to have like you you're exactly right
[37:59] you don't have to act like me I don't
[38:01] want you to act like me I want you to
[38:03] act like God want you to hang when you
[38:05] come under the revival message and
[38:07] realize you're not dead in sins you're
[38:09] not dead in trespasses you're not who
[38:11] you used to be but you're who God's
[38:12] called you to be
[38:13] thank God has sent you a message to
[38:15] revive you to give you life again though
[38:20] I'll notice how says and I heard the
[38:22] voice of many angels round about the
[38:23] throne notice the number of them ten
[38:25] thousand times in thousands thousands
[38:28] thousands saying with the very soft and
[38:30] meek voice we just want to come to
[38:35] church brother Joe you don't have to do
[38:37] all that screaming we can just praise
[38:39] God like this no they were screaming
[38:42] they were shouting they were crying with
[38:44] the loud voice worthy is the lamb what
[38:48] about an evening like Tabernacle is he
[38:50] still worthy tonight is he your worthy
[38:52] lamb look what he has done for you
[38:54] tonight where he's brought you from he's
[38:57] worthy to be praised and notice John how
[39:03] dignified and every creature which is in
[39:07] heaven
[39:08] heard I John and that was on the earth
[39:12] and none of the earth that are they
[39:13] gonna see they didn't hear me say
[39:15] nothing at all no John said everything
[39:17] in heaven heard him everything on earth
[39:19] heard him everything in the sea heard
[39:21] John John realized he wasn't worthy John
[39:24] realized that his his eternal
[39:26] destination Hagen if he was found in the
[39:29] book and when there was no man found
[39:31] worthy God provided the worthy one and
[39:33] when he took that book in he opened the
[39:36] seal
[39:36] John had a reason to shout let me tell
[39:38] you chuck we are both people on the book
[39:40] tonight that's not a cliche
[39:42] we have been darnay's
[39:44] found in the pages of the book we have
[39:46] eternal life we have been revived by the
[39:49] revival masses of this hour a revival
[39:54] broke out in heaven and I think if a
[39:56] revival can break out in heaven why
[39:57] can't it break out here tonight I need
[40:00] some more volume
[40:01] well my revival is going to stop real
[40:03] quick but we noticed when people pray
[40:08] for revival many times what we're
[40:10] expecting is a great Sunday morning
[40:11] service or a great wizzy night service
[40:15] but revival is more than a Sunday
[40:18] morning in a windy night experience
[40:21] revival is that you're asking God to
[40:25] restore me back to what I was in the
[40:27] beginning God restore me past my fears
[40:30] God restore me past the sicknesses that
[40:33] ravished my body
[40:34] let me look beyond my mom battles I try
[40:36] to condemn me let me go beyond my scene
[40:39] in my unbelief and try to destroy me let
[40:41] me go past all the failures of my
[40:43] mistakes and the things I've done in my
[40:45] past he filled me with an inexhaustible
[40:47] insatiable desire for the word God
[40:50] restore me Lord revive me tonight God
[40:53] more than a we see night more than a
[40:55] Sunday morning let it be a life o fire
[40:57] for God and brother madam would say it
[41:02] like this in the message the third seal
[41:03] he says now revelations he had said in
[41:05] the hour and the time but the last angel
[41:07] the seventh angel when he begins to
[41:09] sound the mystery of God is finished
[41:12] the restoration back to the word notice
[41:16] where we're being restored - back to the
[41:19] word the original word this is not a
[41:23] denominational word but it's the
[41:25] original word he said the Bible said
[41:26] that this measure of the last days will
[41:29] restore them back to the original faith
[41:31] back to the faith of the fathers but you
[41:34] think they receive it speaking of the
[41:35] church now no sir the last days he would
[41:38] restore the original word again as he
[41:41] said in Malachi 4 that she had forfeited
[41:44] notice the church had forfeited that
[41:47] word but not the bride he says now she
[41:52] was dead in her traditions and dogmas
[41:54] that
[41:55] he missed it notice she was dead in her
[42:00] traditions and her dogmas that she
[42:02] missed the movement of God he came took
[42:06] on flesh manifested himself opened the
[42:09] blinded eyes and raised up to that and
[42:12] yet they missed the very coming of the
[42:14] word made flesh and many have missed his
[42:17] coming in this hour
[42:18] he said now he says they miss him the
[42:21] living were manifested in the flesh by
[42:24] the word that is promised jesus said
[42:27] that the manifested word he said now he
[42:29] said to the bride or the Hebrew bride he
[42:31] says because you hold to your traditions
[42:33] to you make the Word of God without any
[42:36] effect to you it can't be effective you
[42:39] got to cut it down just a little bit
[42:40] whoo are y'all is it hot out there not
[42:45] this kind of hot these are hot I'm
[42:48] scared to touch them and we just said
[42:51] we're gonna get it down just a little
[42:53] bit more y'all got me on fire up here
[42:55] but notice now he says because you hold
[42:58] to your traditions you make the Word of
[43:01] God of none effect to you
[43:03] he can't be effective so their whole
[43:06] notes are their own ideas but they hold
[43:08] on to some man's idea or some doctrine
[43:10] some some Pentecostal doctor of some
[43:12] Baptist doctor or some church doctrine
[43:15] and when it does it limits the Word of
[43:17] God he limits the effective power of the
[43:20] Holy Spirit on that person in that life
[43:22] in that church in the Spirit of God came
[43:24] move and they can't have a revival
[43:26] because why because a hold no true
[43:28] traditions come down please he says now
[43:34] we've had denominational revivals you
[43:36] ask them to cut you up they shoot you to
[43:37] the top they ask you to cut you down
[43:39] they take their slow time getting there
[43:41] that's okay hey I wouldn't try to do
[43:44] this without sound man and to be
[43:45] horrible we're thankful for our brothers
[43:48] up there god bless you now that's good
[43:51] hey man he says we've had the nomination
[43:54] revivals he goes but we haven't had a
[43:57] real stirring no no no he says now don't
[43:59] think we've got revivals we have it
[44:01] oh they got millions and millions and
[44:03] millions of church members but not a
[44:05] revived
[44:06] no where no no he goes the bride hasn't
[44:10] had a revival yet
[44:12] now I'm not cherry-picking this and
[44:13] saying that the bride ain't had a
[44:14] revival because he preached it's the
[44:16] third seal in 1963 he still had four of
[44:19] the seals to go and we know about the
[44:21] Scriptures that the word has been
[44:22] restored to the bride but he says here
[44:25] now the bride hasn't had a revival yet
[44:27] there's been no revival there no
[44:30] manifestation of God to stir the bride
[44:32] he says we're looking for it but in a
[44:35] take those seven unknown thunders back
[44:37] there to wake her up again look in the
[44:41] church of evening like Tabernacle say
[44:43] Amen to the Word of God it's gonna take
[44:46] those seven unknown thunders to wake her
[44:49] up again and let me tell you we're not
[44:51] reading in a closed book we're not
[44:53] feasting on that close but but every
[44:55] seals been removed and we're feeding on
[44:57] an open book with an open maze that
[44:59] gives life to the body if you'll just
[45:01] take it and read it they consume it and
[45:03] desire the same effect of the word oh
[45:06] [Applause]
[45:08] yes it will take those seven unknown
[45:11] thunders back there to wake her up and
[45:14] he will send it oh the devil says oh he
[45:19] ain't doing nothing this time he will
[45:21] send it he promised it now watch he says
[45:26] now she was dead speaking of the church
[45:28] so we find her the Lamb took the book
[45:31] beginning to rip the seals off and
[45:34] brother BAM said when he ripped his
[45:35] seals off the book he handed it down to
[45:38] his messenger who dispersed it to his
[45:41] people so he not only took the book but
[45:46] he had the authority and the power to
[45:48] open the contents and let you see that
[45:51] you were part of the original plan of
[45:52] God oh my you know we drag in the church
[45:57] I'm guilty you're guilty we drag in
[45:59] we've had a bad day but all if you can
[46:01] just see what John saw I don't care how
[46:04] bad your day is being least you're not
[46:06] headed to a sinner's grave in a devil's
[46:09] hell but you've been called by the work
[46:11] you've been anointed
[46:12] you've been elected your name has been
[46:15] found in the book truck you're going up
[46:18] and you're not going down dr. revival
[46:20] beginning the strike and let the wire
[46:22] talk I don't care how bad your day is
[46:25] being now word has been given it has
[46:27] been this sparks to our body now it's
[46:29] time for that body to take that word in
[46:32] and say let revival come let life come
[46:35] let healing come let deliverance call
[46:37] that salvation come let it come to the
[46:40] body tonight and let it change us
[46:44] revelations 10 7 but in the days of the
[46:47] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[46:49] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[46:53] be finished as he has declared to his
[46:56] servants the prophets now we believe God
[46:58] has sent us that messenger and there's
[47:02] no longer any mysteries now they want to
[47:05] make it a mystery saying you get them
[47:07] going past the label to see an age and
[47:10] then now we got to have another
[47:11] messenger no we're no longer people
[47:14] that's groping in darkness go from would
[47:16] creed to another creed one church to
[47:19] another church one denomination to
[47:21] another denomination those seven
[47:24] thunders has already thundered out the
[47:26] revelation of the seals and those seven
[47:30] thunders has already awakened the bride
[47:35] did you hear what I said bride those
[47:38] seven thunders don't opening of those
[47:40] seven seals has already stirred her he's
[47:43] already awakened her has already revived
[47:45] her given her life and that's why we can
[47:48] have a prize for a Bible the act of
[47:50] restoring to the original life not some
[47:53] life with the denomination not Surratt
[47:55] life with some idea of a man but we're
[47:57] being restored on a daily basis by the
[47:59] opening of the word back to the original
[48:02] thought that God had for us and he says
[48:07] now the churches if the churches would
[48:11] forget their Creed and the dogmas and
[48:14] just take the Bible and plead the
[48:17] promise then it would come effective to
[48:20] them he's speaking about the church the
[48:22] spiritual brought her today so called
[48:24] the church she
[48:25] takes the Word of God but she won't
[48:27] accept it she accepts dogmas instead
[48:30] therefore the word is not effective to
[48:33] her see because she tries to inject her
[48:36] creed or or with the word and it won't
[48:38] work so you can't inject your own ideas
[48:42] to the word and expect it to work
[48:44] tonight we find here in the third seal
[48:48] brother Matt makes this statement he
[48:50] says now in The Herald of us coming we
[48:52] remember we know what that is as to the
[48:54] book or the magazine that brother system
[48:57] were put out he said here they are they
[48:59] lived across the headlines is we need a
[49:01] prophet to return we need a prophet to
[49:03] return he goes and I guess when he does
[49:05] return they won't know nothing about it
[49:07] just like I said he goes we need a
[49:09] prophet to return who were bringing the
[49:11] word of the Lord and be fearless those
[49:15] are crying out for a prophet they're
[49:17] crying out for the word to be restored
[49:18] and yet he was there he ate with them he
[49:21] drank with him he went on trips with him
[49:23] he was his campaign manager and yet when
[49:26] he was there he opened a blinded eyes
[49:28] and he raised up the dead and all these
[49:30] things and yet they missed the very
[49:32] manifestation of the word for their day
[49:34] but let me tell you a little bride your
[49:36] eyes have been open and your ears have
[49:38] heard what prophesy sages it meaning it
[49:40] long to hear and long to see what
[49:42] because you've been anointed to have a
[49:44] prize my Bible on awakening in your soul
[49:47] then will you can't miss this coming
[49:49] because you're part of the coming Oh
[49:52] hallelujah
[49:54] hey goes here oh you can hardly probably
[49:57] print anything unless it's fast and pray
[49:59] and fast and pray sound of trumpet he
[50:03] goes get it how many reads you know you
[50:04] see it all the time fast pray fast pray
[50:06] that's all you hear fast pray we're
[50:09] gonna have a great breaking of the day
[50:10] that's a great thing there's a great
[50:12] thing that's gonna happen all of you
[50:13] pray now pray we're not too late yet Rob
[50:16] Rob says why do they do that why do they
[50:19] do that he goes they want an awakening
[50:22] notice what the church wants they want
[50:25] an awakening this is the Pentecost they
[50:27] want an awake and they're crying
[50:29] believing that they will be awakened
[50:31] they're good people but why is it what
[50:33] are they done they have not recognized
[50:36] the awakening of a bride
[50:40] they have not recognized the awakening
[50:44] of the bride oh they were fine with the
[50:48] signs and the wonders long as he was
[50:50] opening up the eyes and and giving her
[50:52] hearing to the death and raising up to
[50:54] dead they were fine with the signs and
[50:57] the manifestation but when the word
[50:59] broke loose and he began to reveal the
[51:01] secrets of God he began to reveal the
[51:04] opening of the seals and the very mind
[51:06] of God they fail to recognize who he was
[51:09] because they were whole note -
[51:10] Pentecostal traditions they were holding
[51:12] on to some dance or some jump or some
[51:15] emotion but let me tell you God ain't
[51:16] only in dance and shouting in amongst
[51:18] he's in his word and his word is life
[51:21] and he sent us life in this house to
[51:23] have a word board my Bible he goes there
[51:27] being Christians they feel the pull of
[51:29] the hour but they haven't recognized
[51:31] what's been done that's what's making
[51:33] them feel that way they know something
[51:35] supposed to happen but they're looking
[51:37] way off in the future for it to come
[51:39] when it's already happened right by you
[51:44] so we find in the third seal they were
[51:46] waiting brother BAM says there's been no
[51:48] stirring to awaken the bride but now he
[51:51] comes here and recognizing your day in
[51:54] 64 and he says now they have not
[51:56] recognized the awaiting he says when
[51:58] those seals were open the book became a
[52:01] new book the Bible became a new book
[52:06] because he received a life of the word
[52:09] and it'll become a new book to you why
[52:14] are you here tonight because something
[52:16] is stirring at your heart oh we're not
[52:19] here just for denominational ideas and
[52:21] to say we we've going to church and for
[52:23] filling our religious duties no we're
[52:25] here because something is speaking to us
[52:27] something that's pulling us something is
[52:29] drawing a service after service and
[52:31] they're crying God sent us a prophet God
[52:33] said it's a prophet and God sent him not
[52:35] only a prophet but he's sent in the
[52:37] message the seventh angel to their day
[52:40] to the to the word for their day and yet
[52:42] they missed him he performed the same
[52:44] signs the same ones he was making the
[52:47] Word of God live again and the people
[52:50] rejected him and pushed him off as an
[52:52] outcast but what about the bride Oh
[52:54] hallelujah
[52:55] the more she saw the more she believed
[52:57] and the more she believed the more she
[53:00] woke up and when she woke up chief again
[53:02] to have a revival because why she
[53:05] realized I don't have to be dead I don't
[53:07] understand seeing I don't have to be
[53:09] bound by sickness and disease I've been
[53:11] born again he has sent me a word let's
[53:14] give a mean life and I stopped that word
[53:16] tonight I accept the life of the word
[53:19] tonight but the church the church holds
[53:28] to her traditions not allowing the
[53:32] Living Word to quicken her and revive
[53:36] her and I wonder if many around this
[53:40] message haven't made that fatal mistake
[53:43] hold on to what used to be this is how
[53:48] we used to do it and are not progressing
[53:51] with the word for the rm6 and the
[53:54] world's falling apart again he says now
[53:56] the churches crowd the loudest so what
[53:58] are you hollering about a messiah
[54:00] what do you holland revival in our time
[54:02] back in this and then and the other what
[54:05] are you looking for it to do it what
[54:07] more do you want
[54:09] what does the church won't anyhow we've
[54:11] already got it when I say let revival
[54:15] come
[54:16] I'm not saying let there be another
[54:17] message come that's gonna open the seal
[54:19] I'm saying let the life the message
[54:22] that's been given let it come to my home
[54:24] let it come to my heart let it come to
[54:26] my turn and it changed me tonight
[54:29] that revival come let the life of this
[54:31] message come inside of me tonight it
[54:33] changed me where I'm not just a young
[54:36] person but I'm a son of God I'm a
[54:38] daughter of God Oh fire for God and when
[54:41] I go to my school they'll see something
[54:43] different when I go to my job I'll see
[54:46] something different
[54:50] where are they hollering revival in our
[54:52] town back in this and that and the other
[54:54] what are they what are they
[54:55] looking forward to do it what more do
[54:57] you want what does the church won't
[54:58] anyhow we've already got it God David to
[55:01] us it's his promise for the hour it's
[55:06] his promise for the hour we look in the
[55:09] Bible we see it everywhere through the
[55:11] Bible anointed ones come he says the
[55:14] only ones come on and made the word live
[55:17] again right in the hour for that hour
[55:22] let me just explain to you tonight what
[55:25] we saw after youth camp unknown aid ones
[55:28] making the word live God had called
[55:33] ministry God had anointed ministry to do
[55:36] what to lay hands on the sick and they
[55:37] shall recover but not only that to cast
[55:40] out demons and we've seen seven
[55:43] manifestations of demonic encounters and
[55:46] yet we've been anointed Church I should
[55:48] let you know that the power of God the
[55:50] spirit of God is with this church
[55:52] because we've seen those manifestations
[55:54] come against this church come against
[55:56] our youth camp and come against some of
[55:58] our people and every time they came
[56:00] against it there was an anointing there
[56:02] because God had anointed man to stand
[56:04] against it and make the word live again
[56:07] and I mean I tell you we're here to make
[56:09] this word live not to put it on a shelf
[56:12] not to put it on our belt buckle but
[56:14] I'll make the work talked a lot and they
[56:16] people be changed by the fire of God
[56:18] [Applause]
[56:21] it's more than a cliche it's more than
[56:24] your favorite quote it's making this
[56:26] word manifest and you can't do it but
[56:30] the revival he sins is doing it through
[56:33] you notice now in the beginning was the
[56:37] word the Word was with God in the Word
[56:38] was God and the Word was made flesh and
[56:41] the word is made flesh tonight
[56:43] Oh God gave us to Messiah he promised
[56:48] his promised word for this day it's just
[56:50] waiting notice now it's just waiting for
[56:53] somebody with faith to anoint it and
[56:56] make it live again did y'all hear that
[57:00] let me just go ahead and read that one
[57:02] again if you got a pen and paper you may
[57:05] want to take this down
[57:08] God gave us the Messiah his promised
[57:14] word for this day it's just waiting for
[57:16] somebody with faith to anoint it and
[57:20] make it live again yes sir it's a real
[57:24] Messiah it's the Word of God and I trust
[57:27] I'm looking at men and women tonight
[57:28] that I take this word and make it live
[57:31] again Satan tries to come with doubt and
[57:34] unbelief somebody's gonna know what this
[57:36] word and say I don't have to be bound I
[57:38] don't have to be like that because while
[57:40] I've been given a word that's going to
[57:42] revive me but notice now the church
[57:44] system they don't want God's Word
[57:45] because they're holding on to their
[57:46] traditions say she kept the Word of God
[57:48] and because she held on to her tradition
[57:51] she keeps the Word of God from having an
[57:53] impact or an ill effect in her life in
[57:56] the same night he says what's a
[57:58] spiritual leave she don't want it she
[58:00] wants to keep her traditions and get
[58:02] away from the Word of God and let me say
[58:04] it like this Sonny if you want to hang
[58:05] on to your traditions and you want to
[58:07] hang on to yesteryear then you can't
[58:09] have a word revival as long as you're
[58:11] hanging on to some man-made idea some
[58:14] Creed from some denomination some idea
[58:16] from yesterday you'll never have a real
[58:18] born-again revival because why cuz a
[58:20] revival is for those that are quit
[58:22] looking back and you're looking at where
[58:23] God is and where God's going so we'll
[58:28] never experience a word revival long as
[58:31] we're holding own ideas and creeds and
[58:33] dogmas and you go to some churches
[58:35] brother and you'll get there as more
[58:36] than you go out they sing one or two
[58:38] songs take up the offer and invite to
[58:40] preacher you're limited to 45 minutes
[58:42] you get done they sing one song and they
[58:45] dismiss there's no altar call there's no
[58:47] moving other spirit because while they
[58:48] put God in their tool tradition box and
[58:51] they don't let the power of God loose
[58:53] among the people because a prophet of
[58:56] God said it's 45 minutes Herman is ideal
[58:58] but what if God wanted to go 46 minutes
[59:01] what if he wanted to go two hours what
[59:04] if he wanted to go three hours and you
[59:06] find many times after the service is the
[59:09] sermon is preached and you just linger
[59:11] in the Spirit of God he's meaning you
[59:12] get up and walk out but God is still
[59:14] hanging by and he's still dealing with
[59:17] hearts and life and many come up for
[59:19] prayer
[59:19] even after everybody begins to dismiss
[59:21] to our tutorial because waffle cuz God
[59:23] is not contained to your tradition
[59:25] God is not contained to your idea that
[59:27] the service is this that and the other
[59:29] and when it's all done and we done all
[59:31] that then it's over no God is over when
[59:33] he wants to be over and he's done moving
[59:35] when he wants to be done moving so take
[59:37] God out of your tradition box how did
[59:39] your creed box out of your yeah your
[59:41] yester your ideal box and let God loose
[59:43] tonight and even like to have enough
[59:45] that you can have a revival tonight that
[59:48] the Spirit of God can be free to move in
[59:50] our miss my brother Joe I felt God move
[59:54] once or twice I'm not talking to my
[59:56] feeling God move once or twice I'm
[59:57] talking about every time you walk
[59:59] through these doors you can expect a
[1:00:01] move another spirit whether it be your
[1:00:04] favorite preacher not your favorite
[1:00:06] preacher whether it be a Wednesday night
[1:00:08] or Sunday or a Friday or whatever day we
[1:00:10] have service it doesn't matter whether
[1:00:12] you come through those doors and you're
[1:00:14] draggin because many times we come
[1:00:15] dragon but yet the Spirit of God as dad
[1:00:19] the Bible says David encouraged himself
[1:00:21] in the word or in the Lord and that's
[1:00:25] what the revival does is encouraging
[1:00:27] that that's not who you are but we find
[1:00:30] now the promise of the word in the last
[1:00:32] days is brought to her but she will not
[1:00:34] receive it because she's holding on
[1:00:36] traditions and you find people around
[1:00:39] this message oh my they got belt buckles
[1:00:42] I start claim to fame they got a big
[1:00:45] belt buckle their messes believer
[1:00:48] well they got pictures plastered all
[1:00:50] over the wall let me take God ain't in
[1:00:51] your belt buckle and God ain't in your
[1:00:54] pictures God is in his word and he don't
[1:00:58] want your belt buckle he don't want you
[1:01:01] pictures on the wall he wants to word in
[1:01:03] your heart that's what God is looking
[1:01:07] for before we find me and today if you
[1:01:11] don't get my message you're going to
[1:01:13] hell you should committing spiritual
[1:01:14] adultery what kind of idea is that some
[1:01:19] today now trying to hold you and force
[1:01:21] you to put brother band I'm back in the
[1:01:23] pulpit they gonna dig him out of the
[1:01:25] grave and put him back up in the pulpit
[1:01:27] no they don't take a mechanical device
[1:01:28] and push play hold onto some tradition
[1:01:31] well I got a tradition
[1:01:33] was caught a fivefold ministry for the
[1:01:35] edifying or the perfecting of the saints
[1:01:37] how about let's stick with God's
[1:01:38] tradition of ministry you wanna hang on
[1:01:42] tradition let's stay with God's
[1:01:43] tradition of anointed man prophets
[1:01:45] preachers teachers evangelists
[1:01:47] missionaries let's stay with that
[1:01:48] tradition and let's see what God can do
[1:01:51] with that tradition I said well you
[1:01:53] gotta push play because God can't keep
[1:01:55] the fivefold ministry in line they
[1:01:56] messed it up you telling me God needs
[1:01:58] man's help to put this word and to get
[1:02:01] this bride ready for awhile I say
[1:02:03] absolutely not
[1:02:04] God has seen us exactly what we need for
[1:02:06] a word born revival he sent us anointed
[1:02:09] man
[1:02:09] he says anointed teachers and anointed
[1:02:11] preachers and anointed passes in a game
[1:02:13] of us a prophet for this last we got all
[1:02:16] that we need to have a word born revival
[1:02:18] church
[1:02:20] don't let man trying to tie you up with
[1:02:22] her idea shake yourselves from all those
[1:02:26] kind of beliefs let's have a revival
[1:02:32] life flowing back into the church I look
[1:02:38] across this church and I see the revival
[1:02:40] of embers are burning we see cancer
[1:02:44] being defeated we see a latisha being
[1:02:47] defeated we see all kind of things being
[1:02:49] defeated a little boy and not able to
[1:02:51] walk who jump up and walk see Devils are
[1:02:54] being defeated because there's a word
[1:02:56] born revival that's happening and
[1:02:58] evening lights having a let me tell you
[1:03:00] ain't just for the hand few or the hand
[1:03:02] pick it's for everybody here tonight if
[1:03:05] you'll just say let my Bible come I want
[1:03:07] my own revival when I face my my
[1:03:10] encounter with the enemy I want to have
[1:03:11] a revival on the inside something
[1:03:14] that'll raise up and say say you can't
[1:03:16] have me
[1:03:16] you can't have my joy you can't have my
[1:03:18] body you can't have my mind it ain't
[1:03:21] happening
[1:03:21] I'm a child of God I'm open son of God
[1:03:24] alright daughter of God tonight
[1:03:25] I'll open o to you
[1:03:28] but how can you act like that if you've
[1:03:32] never been revived if you never had life
[1:03:35] come on in C Church we're not looking
[1:03:40] for another messenger we're not looking
[1:03:43] for another message we have everything
[1:03:46] we need for a body change all God is
[1:03:50] looking for is to somebody to anoint the
[1:03:54] word and make it live for the help
[1:03:58] somebody take this word and say come
[1:04:02] revive on life power God come in me and
[1:04:06] live manifest the same size the same
[1:04:11] wonders the same power God Oh church
[1:04:14] that's what we're looking for in this
[1:04:15] hour notice now what separates seed from
[1:04:21] non seed program said the word does the
[1:04:24] separation Bob says they'll be so close
[1:04:28] that it was to see the very elect if
[1:04:30] possible but the word is what's ever he
[1:04:33] goes the anointed was only the word will
[1:04:35] separate them not sighs oh no they'll do
[1:04:38] the same signs but the word is what
[1:04:40] separates him that's why it's got to be
[1:04:43] a word revival and when the seals were
[1:04:45] torn off the book it was a word revival
[1:04:48] it wasn't a man-made revival he wasn't a
[1:04:50] Wesleyan revival it wasn't a Welsh
[1:04:52] revival he wasn't a healing revival he
[1:04:55] wasn't a Pentecostal revival in
[1:04:56] Wisconsin during the revival for this in
[1:04:58] Thomas for the bride to come forth and
[1:05:01] be awakened and revived by the power of
[1:05:03] God so she can take her place in her
[1:05:07] position as the Bride of Christ there
[1:05:11] was a word that was sent to awaken her
[1:05:13] up and I believe God has sinneth and I
[1:05:16] believe we're manifests manifesting that
[1:05:18] right now he says now watch this he says
[1:05:22] watch now when the spiritual bride when
[1:05:24] she begins to have a revival when she
[1:05:27] begins to come back and align herself up
[1:05:29] with the Word of God watch then again
[1:05:31] you see how that the scriptures at that
[1:05:34] time there'll be a message sweep out to
[1:05:37] catch that bride catch that woman the
[1:05:39] elect when she's ready
[1:05:41] to to line up and catch that word for
[1:05:45] her our they'll probably God said
[1:05:46] there'll be a message sweep out and in a
[1:05:49] catch her and she'll line with the word
[1:05:52] for her out that's why you're here
[1:05:54] tonight that's why you drive from
[1:05:56] Arkansas that's why you drive from all
[1:05:58] over that's why you can't go to some
[1:05:59] other church because God has sent a
[1:06:01] message
[1:06:02] God has sent a word in this hour and
[1:06:04] you're lining up with it in this hour he
[1:06:07] said there'll be a message sweep out -
[1:06:09] catch - Brian catch that woman the elect
[1:06:11] he says now then watch again to the
[1:06:13] spiritual church health that the group
[1:06:15] of people called out the Elector through
[1:06:17] every revival Martin Luther it happened
[1:06:19] same on wait through the Reformation it
[1:06:22] happened the same thing in Tommy John
[1:06:24] West it happened the same in a
[1:06:25] Pentecostal first started they dropped
[1:06:27] in women right back in line with the
[1:06:29] word and then they drifted away
[1:06:31] there she goes right back over in the
[1:06:32] chaos but then the time that the people
[1:06:35] are ready to line up there's a message
[1:06:37] comes forth and they line with it
[1:06:40] there's a message in God today has sent
[1:06:43] us a message through a vindicated
[1:06:45] prophet and I'm looking at a people
[1:06:47] that's lining with it if you're not
[1:06:49] going on your own idea you're not going
[1:06:51] on some man's idea but you're lining
[1:06:53] with the Word of God where it says that
[1:06:56] could be corrected you're corrected you
[1:06:58] line with it he says but you notice when
[1:07:00] people begin to try to line with the
[1:07:01] word there comes a fresh message from
[1:07:04] the Word of God right straight to the
[1:07:07] people and they catch that message and
[1:07:09] they line up every time that's why he
[1:07:12] sent Malachi forward to turn the hearts
[1:07:14] but the children are the fathers back to
[1:07:16] the children and the hearts of the
[1:07:17] children back to the fathers want
[1:07:19] because it's to catch the elect lady she
[1:07:23] gotta sent us a fresh message to revive
[1:07:25] you from your old dead denominational
[1:07:28] ideas
[1:07:28] you're dead man-made Crees and things of
[1:07:31] that nature and let me tell you church
[1:07:32] we're not a dead motionless church did
[1:07:36] you hear what I said we're not a dead
[1:07:37] motionless church no but we're a church
[1:07:41] that's on fire for God a church that's
[1:07:44] got life in it a church that sees
[1:07:47] science and wonders being performed in
[1:07:49] our midst
[1:07:50] it's not one here every two or three
[1:07:52] years but we see
[1:07:54] consistently the Word of God the
[1:07:55] removing the other spirit the stirring
[1:07:57] other spirit that revival fires blowing
[1:08:00] through evening light tabernacle and you
[1:08:02] find you hear many testimonies on the
[1:08:03] online come back at this service help
[1:08:05] this one and they felt the anointing on
[1:08:07] that one why because there is a revival
[1:08:09] that's going forth right out of this
[1:08:11] little church right here people's lives
[1:08:13] are being impacted because we're not
[1:08:15] holding on to some Pentecostal idea or
[1:08:18] some Pentecostal Creed no we're holding
[1:08:20] on to the dust saith the Lord see we're
[1:08:24] not part of a Reformation but we're part
[1:08:27] of a restoration to restore life rubber
[1:08:33] band makes a statement the word restore
[1:08:35] here means to return back to his former
[1:08:36] owner to bring back to the former estate
[1:08:38] off condition and he says and we can
[1:08:41] enforce a claim to be restored so you're

[1:09:00] that I'm speaking of tonight
[1:09:01] there should be no demon there should be
[1:09:03] no devil he'll stand before you because
[1:09:06] you have a right through the anointed
[1:09:07] scriptures to stand on this word and say

[1:10:10] enforce to claim tonight God has given
[1:10:13] us a word for this hour to do battle
[1:10:15] with notice now what he says here in the
[1:10:18] message the fundamental foundation of
[1:10:20] our faith let me try to hurry to get
[1:10:21] through this he said Adam could speak to
[1:10:24] the winds and it would stop he could
[1:10:27] speak to the trees and they would obey
[1:10:28] him he could speak to wildlife and it
[1:10:31] would obey him he could speak to the
[1:10:33] waters every what it was everything
[1:10:35] obeyed Adam that's what God gave him
[1:10:40] power over everything on earth but now
[1:10:43] through the fall he lost that power then
[1:10:45] he becomes unconscious of the fact after
[1:10:47] losing his relationship and his
[1:10:49] friendship and fellowship with the
[1:10:51] father then he lost that then he says
[1:10:54] what Adam was in God Christ has redeemed
[1:10:57] us back to that Paul did you hear what
[1:11:02] he just told you tonight what Adam was
[1:11:04] in God he came back and redeemed you and
[1:11:08] I back to them
[1:11:09] Adam had power to speak to the winds you
[1:11:12] Rimmer Dean back to speak to the storms
[1:11:14] in your life Adam had power to speak to
[1:11:17] the trees and they would obey him to
[1:11:19] speak to wildlife and they would obey
[1:11:21] Him and you have been redeemed Church of
[1:11:23] evening like time to come back and take
[1:11:26] Adams place and you can now speak to
[1:11:28] your story
[1:11:29] speak to your enemy speak to your mouth
[1:11:31] and you can watch that thing move
[1:11:33] because why because you're a restored
[1:11:35] son and daughter of God
[1:11:39] he said Adam never had to be sick nor do
[1:11:42] you he never had to be sick he never had
[1:11:46] to die he never had a worry he never had
[1:11:48] a heartache he never had a fear he just
[1:11:50] kind up in the arms of the father just
[1:11:52] like a child everything was his whatever
[1:11:54] he asked why he just gotten everything
[1:11:56] obeyed him because he was God's child
[1:11:59] and that's the child is heir of all
[1:12:02] things he said it when man felt he lost
[1:12:05] this and now what he lost in the fall
[1:12:08] Christ comes back as Redeemer did you
[1:12:11] ever stop to think what Christ redeemed
[1:12:13] us for he gave us everlasting life he
[1:12:17] brought us back to an eternal fellowship
[1:12:19] in relationship with God to be sons and
[1:12:22] daughters of God to restore us back all
[1:12:25] that Adam lost in the fall he came back
[1:12:28] and restored you back to that church I
[1:12:31] [Music]
[1:12:33] don't think you got that everything that
[1:12:38] Adam was all the power all the authority
[1:12:41] that Adam possessed before the fall he
[1:12:44] came back in this hour through the
[1:12:46] revelation of this word and he broke
[1:12:48] down sealed and wanted in him he
[1:12:50] redeemed fallen me back to Adam's place
[1:12:52] as they saw and as they daughter of God
[1:12:54] and now you can speak now this is your
[1:12:58] time just speak to your enemy this is
[1:13:01] your time just speak to your trial this
[1:13:03] is your time to do the moving and the
[1:13:05] shaken because you have been redeemed
[1:13:08] back to the son the position of sonship
[1:13:13] notice when Adam fell the book went back
[1:13:18] into the hands of the original owner no
[1:13:21] man was worthy to take the book but we
[1:13:26] find a revelation is 10 here comes a
[1:13:28] lamb or a mighty angel come down with
[1:13:31] this book no longer closed it was open
[1:13:34] and what does he do he hands it down to
[1:13:36] John John and type of the bride so now
[1:13:40] this book that Adam had possession of
[1:13:44] before the fall now is being handed back
[1:13:47] to fallen man God restoring you right
[1:13:50] back
[1:13:51] Church to everything that Adam was all

[1:22:08] that's right for a restoration he says
[1:22:12] God has a loft that when the Sun comes
[1:22:14] unto that seed it forces the life out of
[1:22:17] that seed and death can't hold it
[1:22:20] anymore and tonight when sons of God
[1:22:25] seed that's been planted on the inside
[1:22:27] of your life when you come up to that s
[1:22:29] Oh n not the SU in there is not enough
[1:22:34] demon power there's not enough Devils in

[1:22:38] out of that seed though Satan tries to
[1:22:40] cover you up though he tries to strike
[1:22:42] you in cancer though he tries to smother
[1:22:44] you with depression and whatever there's
[1:22:46] not enough dirt there's not enough past
[1:22:47] sins there's not enough failures then
[1:22:50] keep that Chi from coming if you only
[1:22:52] lay in the presence of the Sun you can
[1:22:55] have this life that I'm speaking of
[1:22:59] tonight when he said regardless of
[1:23:01] conditions notice he said I'll not
[1:23:07] suffer my Holy One to see corruption nor
[1:23:10] would I leave his soul inhale in brother
[1:23:12] Graham said there wasn't enough time
[1:23:13] there wasn't enough devils there was
[1:23:15] enough anything to keep Christ in the
[1:23:17] grave
[1:23:18] till his body begin to rot because there
[1:23:21] was a law that went forth and he said
[1:23:24] I'll have a church without spot without
[1:23:28] blemish without wrinkle and I'm here to
[1:23:31] tell you tonight Church there's not
[1:23:32] enough Devils there's not enough trials
[1:23:34] there's not enough heartaches there's
[1:23:36] not enough hardship that you go through
[1:23:37] that can stop that word from coming to
[1:23:39] pass there's a law that's going forth
[1:23:42] and there's a word to back it up tonight
[1:23:45] he said regardless how little we are how
[1:23:48] low we are high and pure we are how and
[1:23:50] holy we are how sick we are how flick
[1:23:52] did we are the law of God speared by his
[1:23:54] word makes it obey Him forces the issue
[1:23:57] give it back now let's move on as I
[1:24:02] could bring him to bring this to a close
[1:24:03] I got well I got till I'm done right
[1:24:10] Ezekiel 37 let's go there notice there
[1:24:14] were four messengers to aid it the tree
[1:24:17] of life or the tree Calla pillar tank
[1:24:21] and worm pollen worm and locusts program
[1:24:23] said four messengers destroyed the tree
[1:24:25] and he said there's four messengers of
[1:24:27] life that restore the tree justification
[1:24:31] sanctification the gifts of the Spirit
[1:24:33] are back and then the word and we find
[1:24:36] here in Ezekiel we find all four stages
[1:24:38] right here he says now the hand of the
[1:24:40] Lord zekiel is 37 verse one the hand the
[1:24:42] Lord was upon me and he carried me out
[1:24:44] in the Spirit of the Lord he sent me
[1:24:45] down the midst of a valley which is full
[1:24:47] of bones and he calls me to pass by them
[1:24:52] roundabout and behold they were very
[1:24:54] many in the open Valley and lo they were
[1:24:56] very dry dead no life and he said unto
[1:25:03] me son of man can these bones live and I
[1:25:06] answered o Lord O Lord God down nois and
[1:25:10] again and he said unto me prophesy upon
[1:25:12] these bones and say unto them oh ye dry
[1:25:15] bones hear the word of the Lord how many
[1:25:19] of you would say that tonight or let me
[1:25:22] hear the words of the Lord he said thus
[1:25:25] saith the Lord God unto these bones
[1:25:27] behold
[1:25:28] I will cause breath to enter into you
[1:25:30] and ye shall live and I will lay sinews
[1:25:33] upon you and will bring flesh upon you
[1:25:36] and I will cover you with skin and I
[1:25:38] will put breath in you and ye shall live
[1:25:41] and you shall know that I am the Lord
[1:25:44] and so I prophesied as I was commanded
[1:25:48] and as I prophesied there was a noise oh
[1:25:53] that was a revival begin to break out in
[1:25:56] the valley of dry bones bo came back to
[1:26:00] bone here's a bunch of cracking and
[1:26:02] popping but something was taking place
[1:26:04] he said Bo come the bone together and it
[1:26:07] went out but he'll load seniors came on
[1:26:10] the flesh and flesh came upon them and
[1:26:12] skin cover them but there was no breath
[1:26:15] in them they had all three stages but
[1:26:18] they lacked the final stage which is a
[1:26:20] stage of life for the Spirit of God
[1:26:22] quickens the body to life and I better
[1:26:25] tell you tonight evening life if you're
[1:26:27] some dry bones there's a word here
[1:26:29] that's been prophesied oh we you can
[1:26:31] hear the word of the Lord and he said
[1:26:35] unto me prophesy to the wind prophesy
[1:26:37] Son of Man and say to the wind thus
[1:26:39] saith the Lord God
[1:26:40] come from the four winds over and he
[1:26:42] said Oh breathe and breathe upon these
[1:26:44] slain that they may live and so our
[1:26:46] prophesied as I commanded as he
[1:26:48] commanded me and the breath came into
[1:26:51] them and they lived and they stood up
[1:26:57] upon their feet an exceeding great army
[1:27:01] dry bones dead but had a revival in a
[1:27:05] valley you may be in a valley tonight
[1:27:08] you may be drying in different tonight
[1:27:10] you may be justified you may be
[1:27:12] sanctified you may be able to shout put
[1:27:15] you're lacking something but I want you
[1:27:17] to know tonight you can have that life
[1:27:19] the breath of life the Bible says when
[1:27:23] that breath the life came upon them they
[1:27:25] became an exceedingly great army and
[1:27:28] brother man was saying like this in the
[1:27:29] restoration abroad days was two four
[1:27:31] stages of eat Ezekiel's bones coming
[1:27:33] forth but the life only come not when
[1:27:35] the sinew skin came was was come upon
[1:27:38] them but when the wind blowed upon them
[1:27:40] that's when come
[1:27:41] back he goes that's when come back that
[1:27:44] fourth messes of life and I'll say
[1:27:46] tonight let the winds of your spirit
[1:27:49] father blow on me once the musicians
[1:27:52] start making their way
[1:27:57] maybe you're here tonight and brother
[1:27:59] branham gives a story an analogy here of
[1:28:02] some some massive pine trees in a great
[1:28:06] forest he was riding down with one of
[1:28:10] the brother brother Backstrom I believe
[1:28:11] it was and they were riding on horseback
[1:28:13] at night and the moon began to shine
[1:28:14] across these big trees and they were
[1:28:16] white a barn over don't come through
[1:28:18] there and there was no life you know and
[1:28:21] come through many years ago and he said
[1:28:23] it was very spooky big white trees moon
[1:28:25] shining down upon them and and all these
[1:28:27] trees were doing the wind would hit
[1:28:29] against them and they were just began to
[1:28:30] go and I thought oh man what a spooky
[1:28:37] place then he said I thought to myself
[1:28:40] what the ocala pill over an Apollo worm
[1:28:42] left the calliper leti and what the
[1:28:44] caterpillar left the locust is eaten but
[1:28:46] I will restore I will restore said Lord
[1:28:50] hallelujah God's gonna have a church I
[1:28:52] will restore saith the Lord and brother
[1:28:54] makes the same he says now fundamentally
[1:28:56] they retrieved yes they were they were
[1:28:58] once a tree the Methodist a Baptist
[1:29:02] Presbyterian the Moody's they were all
[1:29:03] all the rest of them they were once
[1:29:05] great big towering spires but they say
[1:29:08] the days of miracles is past and you
[1:29:10] find today they say we don't need
[1:29:11] officer calls find today we don't need
[1:29:14] the Holy Ghost being preached to our
[1:29:16] young people find today they don't need
[1:29:18] a real revival we just have an
[1:29:22] intellectual understanding what is that
[1:29:24] blowing through and I will say to you
[1:29:31] tonight don't allow these messengers of
[1:29:34] death to eat at you t that your victory
[1:29:37] t that your joy
[1:29:39] t that your revival because I stood
[1:29:44] there and I looked and they're coming
[1:29:45] wind again and instead of bending they
[1:29:48] just begin to go said of bending and
[1:29:52] moving with it they just begin to moan
[1:29:54] and
[1:29:55] oh the days of miracles has passed
[1:29:57] there's no such thing as a Holy Ghost
[1:30:00] and he said I was discouraged kind of
[1:30:03] like John was I was discouraged and I
[1:30:06] said Lord you said you would restore and
[1:30:08] about that time the wind dropped a
[1:30:10] little bit lower and he goes and I
[1:30:15] looked and goes when I did I noticed
[1:30:17] there was some under groves down there
[1:30:19] hold the wind decided there was no
[1:30:22] moving up here with the old trees that
[1:30:24] were burnt over and dead but the wind
[1:30:26] dropped a little bit lower and there
[1:30:28] were some undergrowth down there and he
[1:30:30] said when the winds begin to hit the
[1:30:31] undergrowth they begin to frolic they
[1:30:34] begin to jump they begin to shout they
[1:30:36] can bend with the moving of the Spirit
[1:30:39] and I say what about an evening like
[1:30:40] Taverner won't you say like me tonight
[1:30:43] let the winds of your spirit drop down a
[1:30:45] little bit Lord tonight God and let me
[1:30:48] move with the spirit let the winds of
[1:30:50] your power let the winds of revival
[1:30:53] forgetting to strike me Lord and let me
[1:30:55] not be starchy let me not be holding the
[1:30:57] past audience but let me be somebody
[1:31:00] that can move with the spirit that can
[1:31:02] bend with the anointing that can go
[1:31:04] where the Spirit of God is going that
[1:31:06] can answer just same way the word
[1:31:08] answers he said every time the wind
[1:31:12] blows Tim little trees just dig a little
[1:31:14] bit deeper
[1:31:15] they said that Jesus Christ was the same
[1:31:17] yesterday today and forever
[1:31:19] these little trees throw their hands I'm
[1:31:20] saying hallelujah they rejoice over the
[1:31:24] word for their day but the big trees
[1:31:29] they couldn't be in with the Spirit they
[1:31:31] couldn't move but the new trees were
[1:31:33] alive the old trees were dead that's the
[1:31:36] reason they can't being because it's
