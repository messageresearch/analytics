[35:06] Him and and to give him glory and praise
[35:10] amen always enjoy the oh enjoy every
[35:13] time we've able to come to the house of
[35:15] the Lord but the midweek service is just
[35:17] a wonderful time to be able to let off a
[35:20] little pressure and because he tends to
[35:22] build up and and so we're here to do
[35:24] that Luke 9 and verse 57
[35:28] said it came to pass that as they went
[35:30] in the way a certain man said unto him
[35:33] Lord I will follow thee whether soever
[35:37] thou goest and Jesus said unto him foxes
[35:40] have holes birds of the air have Nest
[35:44] but the son of man hath not where to lay
[35:46] his head and he said to another follow
[35:49] me but he said Lord suffer me first to
[35:51] go and bury my Father and Jesus said
[35:54] unto him let the dead bury their dead
[35:57] but go thou and preached the kingdom of
[35:59] God and another also said Lord I'll
[36:01] follow thee but let me go
[36:04] first let me first go bid them farewell
[36:07] which are at home at my house and Jesus
[36:10] said unto him no man having put his hand
[36:13] to the plow and looking back is fit for
[36:17] the kingdom of God Amen we'll let you be
[36:21] seated I've been thinking on these
[36:23] thoughts
[36:24] of this thought of Faith to go with him
[36:28] been thinking on it a while and then
[36:30] brother Tim would actually preach Sunday
[36:32] on Elisha following after Elijah and not
[36:35] turning back and I was going to decided
[36:38] I thought maybe go another way and I got
[36:40] up this morning a little bible app would
[36:43] have the some of these very same words
[36:45] about following Jesus take up your cross
[36:47] the scripture of take up your cross and
[36:49] follow him so I thought well I better
[36:51] follow him so we're here following him
[36:53] but you know I I I was thinking on this
[36:56] word follow me and and I thought it was
[36:58] interesting that they were as they went
[37:01] in the way a certain man said Lord I
[37:04] will follow thee and and and you know
[37:07] and then they begin to give up all the
[37:09] give all the excuses why they couldn't
[37:11] and I and I thought about the disciples
[37:13] and how God's call upon their life and
[37:16] you know was very very simple he just
[37:19] walked up to them and said follow me it
[37:21] wasn't a bunch of big words it was two
[37:24] two words that he would use follow me
[37:26] and and to think of what it took or what
[37:28] would happen in their lives to where
[37:31] they would absolutely drop all they were
[37:33] doing and and move on and follow him and
[37:36] and they they would leave everything
[37:37] behind they left families they left
[37:39] homes they they left work they left
[37:42] mothers and fathers they left it all to
[37:45] follow after him and and you know
[37:47] there's a man we'll get into about the
[37:48] Rich Young Ruler but but right after I
[37:51] want to kind of jump ahead before I get
[37:53] there but but right after he had told
[37:55] that Rich Young Ruler you know to go and
[37:57] sell all I have and give unto the poor
[38:00] and he wouldn't do it because he was
[38:01] exceedingly rich and Jesus would say to
[38:03] his disciples he would say verily I say
[38:06] unto you that a rich man shall hardly
[38:08] enter into the kingdom of heaven and
[38:11] again I say to you it's easier for a
[38:13] camel to go through the eye of a needle
[38:15] than for a rich man to enter the kingdom
[38:17] of heaven and and I've kind of wondered
[38:19] and thought about that a lot and course
[38:21] there's a lot of ideas but you know
[38:23] Jesus point was that the it was the
[38:26] humility of simple faith that was
[38:29] required to enter into the kingdom of
[38:31] God it wasn't riches it wasn't anything
[38:34] we could do or what we have done that's
[38:36] going to get us there but our faith in
[38:38] him and following after him you know uh
[38:41] rich people let me let me let you
[38:43] understand something you can be rich in
[38:45] a lot of things I'm not just necessarily
[38:47] talking about money you can be rich in
[38:49] Pride you can be rich in arrogance you
[38:51] can be rich in all kinds of things and
[38:54] if you're not willing to lay all of that
[38:56] aside and follow him him amen then
[38:58] you're not worthy of the Gospel but you
[39:00] know rich people they find it easy to
[39:02] get what they want to fix Earthly
[39:04] problems you know by by their money and
[39:06] they and they and they find it difficult
[39:09] to Humble themselves this is where he
[39:11] was at this man that this Rich Young
[39:13] Ruler admitting you know they have to
[39:15] admit that they need someone else to
[39:17] provide for them that's an unnatural
[39:20] experience when you know but this as I
[39:22] said this can apply to more than just
[39:24] money there's there's people that were
[39:26] rich and intellect they're they're rich
[39:28] in looks they're rich in power they and
[39:31] all of these can fall into the same trap
[39:34] and the disciples are essentially asking
[39:36] when they would ask they would ask this
[39:39] question as we'd go and the disciples
[39:40] heard it and they were exceedingly
[39:42] amazed saying who then can be saved if
[39:46] this man cannot be saved there's a
[39:47] squeal up here there if these men cannot
[39:49] be saved then who can be saved and if
[39:52] you get to looking at that they thought
[39:53] that let me have me a handh here they
[39:55] thought that there was uh that there
[39:58] that if you had the blessings in your
[39:59] life and they had big big Barns and you
[40:01] had a great amount of money and you had
[40:03] all these things then then then it was
[40:06] impossible that God didn't have his
[40:08] favor upon you amen that God's favor was
[40:11] not upon you so they would look at all
[40:13] of this and they would see this man had
[40:15] many riches and they'd see he had many
[40:16] Barns and they'd see he had all these
[40:19] things Earthly uhh attributes but and so
[40:23] they thought well if this man can't be
[40:24] saved cuz surely he has God's blessings
[40:26] on him amen but brother Brandon would
[40:28] say not always is riches or things like
[40:31] this a sign of God's blessing amen but
[40:34] many times it's exactly the opposite but
[40:36] you know he said so so they were looking
[40:38] they were essentially if those if those
[40:41] we think are blessed by God cannot be
[40:43] saved then who can be saved what hope is
[40:46] there for the rest of us we don't have
[40:48] the riches he has we're poor we we've
[40:51] all of this and Peter said yes Lord
[40:53] behold we have forsaken all and follow
[40:56] thee what shall we have therefore and
[40:59] Jesus said verily I say unto you this
[41:01] Matthew chapter 19 and: 28 Jesus said
[41:04] verily I say unto you that ye which have
[41:07] followed me in the Regeneration when the
[41:09] son of man shall sit in the Throne of
[41:11] his glory you also shall sit upon 12
[41:14] Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel
[41:16] and everyone that has forsaken houses
[41:19] and Brethren and sisters and fathers and
[41:21] mothers or wife or children or lands for
[41:24] my name's sake shall receive aund F and
[41:28] shall inherit everlasting life amen he
[41:31] said but many that are first shall be
[41:33] last so in other words many that are
[41:35] thought that's going to be that were
[41:37] first here upon this Earth will be last
[41:39] over there and many that were last here
[41:42] shall be first over there amen what is
[41:45] it it was God's requirements to follow
[41:47] him and brother Brandon would take a
[41:49] message from this and he would call it
[41:50] forsaken all Amen to to be able to walk
[41:53] to have faith to go with him you have to
[41:55] have faith that you not you but it's him
[41:58] that's the that leads the way it's not
[42:00] you that can make the way but he makes
[42:02] the way it's not you that can make make
[42:05] things happen it's him that makes things
[42:07] happen you know he said the greatest
[42:09] thing I found in a Christian Life is
[42:11] letting the Holy Spirit lead you and
[42:14] guide you and his work is marvelous how
[42:17] many's ever been led by the spirit of
[42:19] God he said that's wonderful led by the
[42:21] spirit of God there's no one would lead
[42:23] you to the altar but the spirit of God
[42:26] there's no one that would bring you here
[42:28] tonight but the spirit of God he said is
[42:30] that right he moves in mysterious ways
[42:33] and his wonders to perform he said how
[42:36] God knows how to do things if we would
[42:39] just follow him he said we're not here
[42:42] to lead God but God's here to lead you
[42:45] amen I'm thankful you know we have our
[42:47] ways and what we want but if we can just
[42:49] surrender our wills and our ways and our
[42:52] thoughts to his thoughts and to his ways
[42:55] amen they're much higher than our ways
[42:57] amen we think we're giving up a lot when
[42:59] we come to Christ you're not giving up
[43:00] nothing compared to what you
[43:03] get amen it's peanuts compared to what
[43:06] you am me what you experience when you
[43:08] give your heart to Christ I was speaking
[43:10] to a young man just the other day and I
[43:12] told him you know many times young
[43:14] people think well I'm going to give up
[43:15] friends I'm gonna give up my my
[43:17] popularity at school or I'm going to
[43:19] give up this but I'm here to tell you
[43:21] what you're going to get is greater than
[43:23] what you're going to give up amen
[43:25] because God will never be an endeav it
[43:27] to anyone amen If he if you have to give
[43:30] up friends if you have to give up family
[43:32] well he'll give you more friends and
[43:34] better friends and better family amen
[43:37] but you have to have faith to walk with
[43:39] him to go with him amen it's not going
[43:41] to be always easy listen the path that
[43:43] he lead sometimes looks very dark it's
[43:46] very steep it's very hard there's a lot
[43:48] of Trials there's a lot of things that
[43:50] goes on and we don't know and we kind of
[43:52] lose our our our bearing sometime but if
[43:54] you'll just continue to walk with him
[43:57] God to make sure you make it all the way
[44:00] through it's just as I was saying the
[44:01] other day amen he said let us go into
[44:04] the other side listen he wasn't
[44:06] concerned about the water he wasn't
[44:08] concerned about the winds he wasn't
[44:10] concerned about the waves he already had
[44:12] the answer for amen listen God's the
[44:15] same way in this day he's not concerned
[44:17] about a sickness or an issue in the
[44:19] sense that he's helpless he's never
[44:21] helpless but he always has an answer he
[44:24] always able to provide he's always able
[44:26] to move you in the right place if you
[44:29] will yield yourself to him but you know
[44:31] see we we try sometimes to lead God the
[44:34] way we want to go you know we want we
[44:36] want it to go our way you know many many
[44:38] times and and that's because we're rich
[44:40] in our pride or we're rich in our own
[44:43] ideas but see we got to lay all that
[44:45] aside he said we are the ones to be led
[44:48] he said I I want I love that how God
[44:50] likeness unto sheep he said did you ever
[44:53] see a sheep that was lost why he's the
[44:55] most helpless Critter there is is in the
[44:57] world he can't find his way out he can't
[45:00] protect himself he can't fight for
[45:02] himself he can only stand there and
[45:04] bleed until a wolf eats him or he dies
[45:07] he can't find his way back he said
[45:09] that's the way it is when a man is lost
[45:11] he's totally
[45:13] helpless hallelujah amen if you're
[45:16] without God tonight you are totally
[45:19] helpless you said well I got my way
[45:21] figured out well it may work out all
[45:23] right for a while but one day you're
[45:25] going to come to the end of your way
[45:27] and God if you don't have God on your
[45:29] side and you're going to end up in a
[45:30] heap of trouble and like that sheep out
[45:33] there somewhere ate by the Wolves but if
[45:35] you'll just come God's way and allow God
[45:38] to come on your life allow God to lead
[45:40] you and guide you then God can take you
[45:43] into places that you never dreamed
[45:45] possible before he said that's the way
[45:47] it is when a man is lost he's totally
[45:49] helpless there's nothing you can do
[45:51] about it God through his grace will come
[45:54] though and lead you to Christ Jesus said
[45:56] no man can come to me except the father
[45:59] draws him and all that he draws come and
[46:02] I that comes I will give him everlasting
[46:04] life what a promise he said I wish I
[46:07] could get every person here that would
[46:09] that would just sink down under the
[46:10] fifth rib on the left side till they hit
[46:13] the core of the heart you'll see people
[46:15] get up with all kind of diseases hanging
[46:18] on them walk out of this building
[46:20] rejoicing refusing to have it cripples
[46:22] would walk why cuz they refuse to know
[46:25] anything else but but God's Will and
[46:28] God's way amen if we could have that
[46:30] kind of Faith he said well you're scared
[46:32] you're afraid to make the start you're
[46:34] waiting for God to come down and pull
[46:37] you out God doesn't do that you're the
[46:39] one that has to make the step but he
[46:41] give the promise that says come on then
[46:44] you follow then God will
[46:48] move amen listen that's exactly how it
[46:51] is you feel that tug follow me amen amen
[46:54] but let me tell you if you continue to
[46:56] push that down and you continue to push
[46:58] it back in the back part of your mind
[47:00] well maybe another service maybe another
[47:02] time maybe another day I I I'll follow
[47:05] him but if you continue to feel it amen
[47:07] you need to respond God's waiting for
[47:10] your response he's waiting for you
[47:12] whether it be in your seat to say Lord
[47:14] I'm sorry or you come to an altar
[47:16] Whatever It Is God is looking for you to
[47:19] move amen he's looking for you to do
[47:22] something but here this the scripture
[47:24] talks about it in Luke 18 and verse 18
[47:27] about the Rich Young Ruler he he asked a
[47:30] wonderful question he said good Master
[47:32] what shall I do to inherit eternal life
[47:35] now notice what he's asking for he ain't
[47:37] asking for more barns he ain't asking
[47:39] for nothing he wants eternal life that's
[47:41] a good question that's a good desire
[47:43] right Jesus said why why callest thou me
[47:46] good none is good save one that is God
[47:48] thou knowest the Commandments do not
[47:49] commit adultery kill do not steal do not
[47:52] bear false witness honor he said yes all
[47:54] these I've kept for my youth he said
[47:56] Jesus heard these things he said but yet
[47:58] thou lackest one thing sell all thou
[48:01] Hast and distribute it unto the poor
[48:04] that thou may have treasure in heaven
[48:05] and come follow
[48:08] me in other words you're not going to be
[48:10] able to follow me having all what you
[48:12] got brother Brandon would say the
[48:14] brother brother Brandon would say we
[48:15] need to unpack that's right amen it's
[48:18] not a time to be packing up getting
[48:20] ready to go it's a time of unpacking
[48:23] unpacking our pride unpacking our
[48:25] thoughts unpacking the thing and this is
[48:27] where he was he he had so much
[48:29] confidence in his riches and and Jesus
[48:31] saw what his weakness was he saw what
[48:34] when he got in a hard spot what he
[48:36] really depended
[48:38] upon no matter what he said no matter
[48:41] what he would do any other way he saw
[48:44] what what what he would depend on in a
[48:46] weak moment he wouldn't go to God he
[48:49] would go to his
[48:50] riches he wouldn't lean upon the word of
[48:53] God he would go to his riches amen this
[48:56] is where many times we find oursel God
[48:59] knows exactly what you need to get rid
[49:02] of there's some people that can handle
[49:05] money and handle things and and not ever
[49:07] not ever get them into a place where
[49:09] that's what they all depend I'm not talk
[49:11] I'm not trying to Sayan there ain't a
[49:13] person that's got over whatever money
[49:15] you know that you have to have a certain
[49:17] amount in your account or you ain't
[49:18] going to make it that ain't what I'm
[49:19] talking
[49:20] about if that was the case we'd all make
[49:23] it you know if you had to have a
[49:25] Millions if you had a million that
[49:27] capped it off if you had over a million
[49:28] dollars in your account then you
[49:30] couldn't make it to Heaven Well we'd be
[49:31] shouting
[49:34] Glory but you know that that's not what
[49:37] I'm talking about what I'm talking about
[49:38] is if we have something in our life that
[49:41] we depend on in our
[49:43] weakness that when we come to a moment
[49:46] of weakness or a moment that we don't
[49:47] know and maybe it be a temper that's
[49:50] what you go to first or maybe it be some
[49:52] kind of other thing that you allow to
[49:54] rise up in your life this is where God
[49:57] is Jesus is looking at this young man
[49:59] and he said he's wanting eternal life
[50:01] but you know all he's got to do is get
[50:03] rid of Earthly
[50:06] possessions and if you think about it
[50:08] that's a really good
[50:10] trade it may not be easy trade for him
[50:13] at the moment but down the road it would
[50:15] have been a really good trade and I'm
[50:16] sure down the road he would have loved
[50:18] to go back to that moment and make that
[50:21] train but down the road when he found he
[50:24] said brother B said next time you see
[50:25] him is he's lifting up his eyes in Hell
[50:27] amen he couldn't have that moment no
[50:29] more amen he didn't have that
[50:31] opportunity no more but he would have
[50:33] loved to had it in that
[50:36] moment and one day young men young women
[50:39] you're going to come to a place if you
[50:41] don't give your heart to God you're
[50:43] going to want the moment you had on a
[50:45] Wednesday night you're going to want the
[50:47] moment you had when you felt that pull
[50:49] and you felt that call and you refused
[50:52] it service after service after service
[50:54] and you knew there was things that you
[50:56] needed to get give up and you just held
[50:57] on to
[51:01] him you got to have faith to go with
[51:05] him amen because listen what he's going
[51:07] to give you is better than what you
[51:10] got it may not always look like that but
[51:13] let me tell you I can ask every
[51:14] Christian in here a real born again
[51:16] Christian have you had hard times in
[51:18] your life yeah we all had Hard Times
[51:22] amen you're going to have more hard
[51:24] times but has it been worth it
[51:29] have you got more than what you
[51:32] left hey or do you now have more than
[51:35] what you had before yeah you may have
[51:37] traded things where it ain't so much in
[51:39] riches or so much in this that and the
[51:41] other Earthly possessions or whatever
[51:43] amen Earthly family you may have had to
[51:45] leave but listen God will not be
[51:47] indebted to no one God will always give
[51:50] back more than what he
[51:52] [Applause]
[51:54] requires amen this is what he was trying
[51:57] to tell this young man listen I got more
[51:59] riches than what you
[52:02] got amen when you know here he was good
[52:04] Master what what what what am I going
[52:07] well keep the Commandments well I've
[52:08] done that for my youth and he told him
[52:10] what they were and he said I've did this
[52:12] but one thing you lack if you want to
[52:15] have eternal life you sell what you got
[52:18] and give it to the poor and take up your
[52:20] cross and follow me the young man was
[52:23] asked to forsake all but he refused to
[52:26] do it
[52:28] amen he asked to forsake all but he
[52:31] refused to do it he said if we apply
[52:33] prosperity and riches and so forth we
[52:35] think sometimes that's success but this
[52:37] young man was a successful young man but
[52:40] didn't have eternal
[52:42] life he said sometimes success doesn't
[52:46] always mean that God's blessing
[52:49] you so let's follow it we find him
[52:51] here's a young man perhaps a handsome
[52:54] young dress nicely dressed and the Bible
[52:56] says Jesus loved him he must have had a
[52:59] good tender uh uh uh spirit about him
[53:02] conscience about him he might have been
[53:03] he must have been a very fine young man
[53:06] never You' never win the admir
[53:08] admiration of the Lord Jesus because
[53:10] when Jesus but Jesus looked at him he
[53:12] said the scripture said he loved him he
[53:14] must have had maybe a kind look or a
[53:18] just a clean gentleman a straight cut
[53:20] boy but he walks up to Jesus and perhaps
[53:23] thinking in sincerity I would like to
[53:25] know what I can do to have eternal life
[53:28] but when he had to depart with what he
[53:30] had to have to get eternal
[53:37] life he said that same he said the
[53:40] question was at the gate whether he
[53:43] would make the right choice and he said
[53:46] that question lays before every one of
[53:49] us Jesus really asked him to forsake all
[53:52] that he had take up your C my cross and
[53:55] follow me we know the story he went away
[53:57] sorrowful that's right he went away with
[54:00] his heart broken because he had many
[54:02] great riches and Jesus turned and said
[54:05] how hard it would be for a rich man to
[54:07] enter the Kingdom of Heaven be like a
[54:09] camel to go through the eye of the
[54:10] needle it but but that which is
[54:12] impossible with man with God is not
[54:17] impossible it's impossible for a man to
[54:20] make it but without without with God
[54:22] it's not
[54:24] impossible Hallelujah
[54:27] I look at that and I think about I think
[54:28] of it this way he's saying look amen you
[54:31] might think it's impossible for somebody
[54:33] like that to be Sav but if he'll give
[54:35] everything he's got to God God will make
[54:37] it possible amen we look at sin sinful
[54:40] men sometimes we think there ain't no
[54:42] way they ain't impossible that there's
[54:44] no way they can do it but somehow God
[54:47] rich in mercy God can make it possible
[54:50] amen I'm thankful he made it possible
[54:53] amen I was some of the worst one of the
[54:55] worst amen but God God made it
[55:00] possible you see many times we want to
[55:02] hold on to everything that we can and
[55:04] then follow
[55:06] Jesus well that's the reason why that's
[55:09] that's the reason why we're not getting
[55:11] some to the Holy Ghost because it's not
[55:13] a true
[55:14] repentance a true repentance is not just
[55:17] saying I'm sorry it's a it's a repenting
[55:19] of it and turning from it and a dying
[55:24] out too many wants to come and say I'm
[55:26] sorry but they want to come and pick up
[55:28] the same stuff and go right back with it
[55:31] they'll never get it amen you see we
[55:33] want to hold on to everything that we
[55:34] can and then still follow Jesus but
[55:37] Jesus wants us to turn loose of
[55:39] everything so we can get both hands on
[55:43] him see we can't have one hand in the
[55:45] world and one hand in Jesus's hand amen
[55:48] no man can serve two masters you know
[55:50] brother Brown tells a story in the
[55:51] middle of the sermon I I really love
[55:53] this story so I'm just going to bring it
[55:54] in he talks about his two daughters
[55:57] that are there uh in the house and he
[55:59] comes in late and they he gets up early
[56:01] sitting in his recliner what Rebecca saw
[56:03] him first and she come running jumped on
[56:05] his knee you know and and and she was
[56:08] sitting there and she was just enjoying
[56:10] sitting on his knee and here Here Comes
[56:11] little Sarah said and said she she she
[56:14] looked over there you know and Rebecca
[56:16] wanted to know she got to Daddy first
[56:18] and you know I I I beat you you beat you
[56:20] I ain't no more you can't have
[56:22] this spot and and brother ROM said I
[56:25] just kind of move one leg over a little
[56:27] bit and showed her there was another
[56:28] spot over there and here she come
[56:30] running you know just jumped up in my
[56:32] arms and and I put my armed around her
[56:35] and she said and she looked around she
[56:37] and Rebecca looked at her said Sarah I
[56:39] want you to know one thing I was here
[56:41] first she said I've got all of Daddy and
[56:44] there's none left for you he says said
[56:47] see I was here first but poor little
[56:49] Sarah just dropped her head down and and
[56:52] then but I took my finger and I reached
[56:53] out like that and pushed the other leg
[56:55] out and I motion to Sarah to come and
[56:57] here she come and jumped up on the leg
[56:59] and while she couldn't balance herself
[57:00] her little legs wouldn't hit the floor
[57:02] hardly but she was on the leg anyhow so
[57:05] she toddled around like that what to
[57:07] keep her from falling I just put my arm
[57:09] around her and held her and I was
[57:11] holding her close to me and she put her
[57:13] little old head against me a little bit
[57:14] and she looked up at Becca and she said
[57:16] Rebecca my sister I want to tell you
[57:19] something too I may be so that you may
[57:21] be so that you got all of daddy but I
[57:23] want you to know that Daddy's got all of
[57:25] me
[57:27] amen that's the way it is we want him to
[57:29] have all of us we want him to have all
[57:33] of us so the there therefore to do it we
[57:36] have to walk out there by faith and
[57:39] believe him when he calls us to come to
[57:42] believe that he has a place for us to
[57:44] believe that he has a a spot where we
[57:47] can rest upon to believe that he's not
[57:49] bringing us out here for our our harm or
[57:52] for our destruction but he's bringing us
[57:54] here so he can put his arm around us
[57:57] listen God's not taking you through a
[57:59] trial or through a sickness or through
[58:01] an issue amen for your destruction and
[58:03] for your hurt he takes you there so he
[58:06] can put your AR his arms around you he
[58:08] wants you to know listen I've got all of
[58:11] you I've got you in your struggle I've
[58:14] got you in your problems I've got you in
[58:16] your sickness I've got you in this
[58:20] moment maybe you can't reach the floor
[58:22] and you're all out of balance and you
[58:24] don't know which way to turn but God's
[58:26] got his arm around
[58:32] you we can't explain it sometimes but
[58:36] you just got to walk out in faith and
[58:39] trust him there's no way to explain it
[58:42] sometimes you got to believe it but this
[58:44] Rich Young Ruler he couldn't give
[58:46] himself to Christ so he went away and
[58:49] find him later when the words are spoken
[58:52] Soul take thy wet rest and he goes into
[58:54] another place
[58:58] he wasn't worried about those barns
[59:02] then he wasn't worried about his riches
[59:05] then that he hadn't the safe up there he
[59:08] wasn't worried about his gold knob doors
[59:10] and door his gold knob doors and and all
[59:12] the beauty beauty that he had acquired
[59:15] at this moment none of that
[59:17] mattered What mattered is if I could
[59:19] just get a
[59:22] drink if I can just have that drink
[59:24] again
[59:28] this is where we're coming
[59:29] to sooner or later the the chapter on
[59:32] this world is going to
[59:35] end and it's going to come to a place to
[59:38] where all those things you thought was
[59:41] so important ain't going to be so
[59:42] important no
[59:44] more things you thought about in service
[59:46] a time after time that distracted you
[59:48] and kept you from getting something from
[59:50] God or that little something you allowed
[59:52] to rise up every time you felt that pull
[59:54] it would rise up and hit it and knock
[59:56] knock it back down listen some sometime
[59:57] or another that ain't going to be
[59:59] important no more it's going to come to
[1:00:01] a place that you'll say Lord if I could
[1:00:03] just go back to that church and I could
[1:00:05] get another
[1:00:06] drink if I could just go back to that
[1:00:09] place and I could get just drink in what
[1:00:12] you had for me if I could just partake
[1:00:14] of it and then I my soul could be
[1:00:16] satisfied but you won't be able to
[1:00:30] that's exactly what God requires forsake
[1:00:32] all to follow
[1:00:35] him what would my friend say who
[1:00:38] cares let's just just just be real
[1:00:41] tonight who really cares what anybody
[1:00:43] else says what all that matters is what
[1:00:46] he
[1:00:47] says like the man that the boy that
[1:00:50] played the violin and and he played such
[1:00:52] a beautiful rendition of some song and
[1:00:54] and the crowd would just go wild and
[1:00:56] praising him and and all that he just
[1:00:58] looking up up up in the balcony
[1:01:00] somewhere because up there was the
[1:01:03] master and that's all that mattered was
[1:01:06] with whether the master that taught him
[1:01:08] how to do this was pleased with what he
[1:01:10] done that's all that going to matter
[1:01:13] amen will will your life be found worthy
[1:01:15] of the Gospel yes will it be found
[1:01:19] worthy to escape the things that are
[1:01:21] coming upon this Earth listen there's a
[1:01:23] there's a ball of fire about to hit this
[1:01:25] Earth
[1:01:26] amen is going to be Burnt Over by
[1:01:28] nuclear destruction and then by the fire
[1:01:30] of God and and listen when all that
[1:01:32] happens those that are righteous will be
[1:01:34] righteous still and those that are
[1:01:36] filthy will be filthy
[1:01:39] still and we'll look back and we'll
[1:01:41] think about our times listen I guarantee
[1:01:44] you I I I would I would be willing to
[1:01:46] bet Elvis Presley would love to come and
[1:01:48] make some different choices those who
[1:01:50] say they don't believe in God I'd say
[1:01:52] about right now if they pass that line
[1:01:54] they'd love to come back make some
[1:01:56] different choices about their life but
[1:01:58] why we got a choice why we got an
[1:02:00] opportunity to make a choice why we got
[1:02:03] an opportunity to take a drink from his
[1:02:06] cup and to take into our lives eternal
[1:02:09] life why don't we drink
[1:02:25] we find
[1:02:27] him lifting up his soul in
[1:02:33] hell cuz he didn't have the faith to
[1:02:37] follow after him he didn't have the
[1:02:39] faith to go with Jesus I think about
[1:02:41] Nicodemus how close he came we won't
[1:02:45] really know the ending of his story till
[1:02:46] we get on the other side maybe because
[1:02:48] it's not really written that I know of
[1:02:49] in
[1:02:51] scripture but it came so
[1:02:54] close Judas came so close Judas would
[1:02:58] come to the point he'd kiss the doors of
[1:03:00] heaven and turn around and go to
[1:03:05] hell listen it's very serious hour I I
[1:03:08] didn't really expect this to get this
[1:03:09] serious but it's it's a very serious
[1:03:11] hour that we're living
[1:03:13] in we want him to have all of
[1:03:17] us we want to be in his trust and his
[1:03:20] confidence and we place our life in his
[1:03:23] hand that where he leads me I'll follow
[1:03:26] whatever I got to get rid of I'll get
[1:03:28] rid of whatever I got to do I'll do it
[1:03:30] while I got a chance to do it it's worth
[1:03:34] it I was telling this young man what led
[1:03:37] to the Lord I said it's worth it you
[1:03:40] you're going to you're going to find
[1:03:41] you're going to go through a lot of hard
[1:03:42] battles from this moment and you're
[1:03:44] going to have to fight and you're going
[1:03:45] to have to fight and Claw your way but
[1:03:47] it's worth
[1:03:48] it amen you're going to find that
[1:03:51] sometimes you're going to you're going
[1:03:52] to lose maybe a girlfriend or or lose
[1:03:54] some friends out there in the world but
[1:03:56] it's worth
[1:03:57] it amen amen you're going to find that
[1:04:00] you're going to going to lose friends or
[1:04:02] I tell you what what you're going to get
[1:04:04] you'll lose friends that are constantly
[1:04:05] pulling at you and dragging you down and
[1:04:07] you're going to gain friends that'll
[1:04:09] pull you up and lift you up amen you're
[1:04:11] going to you're going to lose family
[1:04:13] they're calling you a heretic and
[1:04:15] calling you amen a Holy Roller and
[1:04:17] calling you you join the call and you're
[1:04:19] going to get a family of God who put
[1:04:21] their arm around you and love you no
[1:04:23] matter what
[1:04:28] it's worth
[1:04:32] it forsake all that's God's requirement
[1:04:35] we got to do it sometimes we have to
[1:04:37] forsake our very own
[1:04:43] thoughts some of us are very rich in
[1:04:45] thoughts and very poor in
[1:04:48] filters well I just got to say something
[1:04:50] no you
[1:04:51] don't hey that's a family trade that's
[1:04:54] been passed down conquer that
[1:04:57] thing amen conquer that thing amen if
[1:05:00] it's if it's spewing out something that
[1:05:02] ain't the word of God you don't have to
[1:05:04] say
[1:05:06] it amen it's a truth you know we you
[1:05:09] need to allow it to kind of go through
[1:05:11] some filters let me tell you the best
[1:05:12] filter there is is this word right here
[1:05:15] this is a thinking man's
[1:05:17] filter amen it'll cause you to kind of
[1:05:19] whoop I don't need to say that nope I
[1:05:21] don't need to do that nope I amen what
[1:05:23] is it it is pulling in the life of God
[1:05:26] in your life and is pushing out all the
[1:05:28] things that we think so
[1:05:33] important scripture says he that loves
[1:05:35] the world or the things of the world the
[1:05:36] love of God's not even in
[1:05:38] him that's right it takes forsaken all
[1:05:42] when you're willing to forsake all and
[1:05:44] follow him then if you abide in me and
[1:05:46] my words in you then you can ask what
[1:05:48] you will and it'll be
[1:05:50] done that sounds like it's worth
[1:05:54] it amen he says if you cannot knowing
[1:05:57] you can't do it knowing you got things
[1:05:59] wrong you know they're wrong but you
[1:06:00] must forsake your own ideas you must
[1:06:03] cope to his word and never will the holy
[1:06:06] ghost ever deny any word that is spoke
[1:06:08] in the Bible it's it's been wrote and
[1:06:10] Vindicated by the spirit of God it'll
[1:06:13] never deny it amen he said if the same
[1:06:15] God that wrote the Bible is in you then
[1:06:17] you're not your own you're dead to your
[1:06:19] thoughts you're dead to your your
[1:06:21] thinking you're dead to the things of
[1:06:22] the world what is it the mind of Christ
[1:06:25] is now in you then you're forsaken all
[1:06:27] to follow him not our own thoughts not
[1:06:30] our own will not what my what but not my
[1:06:33] will but thy will oh Lord then you begin
[1:06:37] to line up with God's
[1:06:39] word you said what do I get then
[1:06:42] forsaken all forsaken all what do I get
[1:06:46] well you can expect the world to make
[1:06:48] fun of you you can expect people to call
[1:06:51] you all kinds of unhonorable names
[1:06:54] they'll call you anything that they can
[1:06:55] call you you'll be despised you'll be
[1:06:58] rejected well well I don't know you keep
[1:07:00] reading I'm not sure it's worth it well
[1:07:02] let me get let me let me get to it Jesus
[1:07:04] because of him being Emanuel God
[1:07:06] dwelling made him do things that was so
[1:07:08] odd to his own church to his own people
[1:07:10] they throwed him out as soon as he come
[1:07:12] in there was the one that hung him on
[1:07:13] the cross they was the one who condemned
[1:07:15] him he loved the people his whole heart
[1:07:17] was for the people but he had to forsake
[1:07:19] everything in order to follow God and so
[1:07:22] do we have to do it well what I getting
[1:07:23] to return some times I think we
[1:07:26] ministers making a little too much
[1:07:27] flowers for the convert oh my oh come on
[1:07:31] to Christ everything's lovely but you
[1:07:33] see it isn't that way all the time it
[1:07:36] isn't a flowery bed of ease because
[1:07:38] Christians have to fight he said the
[1:07:41] Bible said all that live Godly in Christ
[1:07:43] Jesus shall suffer persecution but if
[1:07:47] you're not so if you're not suffering
[1:07:49] persecution for Christ's sake
[1:07:50] something's
[1:07:52] wrong he said if the devil ain't after
[1:07:55] you he's got
[1:07:57] you man I like you can pin this one on
[1:08:00] your refrigerator if the devil Ain't Got
[1:08:02] You he's if he ain't after you he's got
[1:08:05] you that's all because as long as he's
[1:08:08] after you that's a sign he doesn't have
[1:08:10] you
[1:08:11] yet but if he isn't after you it's a
[1:08:14] sign he's got you but just remember as
[1:08:16] long as he's blasting at you your fuse
[1:08:19] jumps ahead of him yet just keep on
[1:08:22] [Applause]
[1:08:24] going hallelujah how many this week the
[1:08:27] devil been blasting at you blasting and
[1:08:29] Blasting and Blasting listen that's a
[1:08:31] sign he ain't got you yet he ain't got
[1:08:34] you in his fold he ain't got you in his
[1:08:36] place you don't belong to him amen
[1:08:39] you're still ahead of him keep
[1:08:42] going young people keep going well I'm
[1:08:44] having mind battles and I'm having this
[1:08:46] and I'm keep
[1:08:53] going all that live Godly in Christ
[1:08:55] Jesus shall suffer
[1:08:59] persecution so
[1:09:01] Rejoice so what brother Timothy I've
[1:09:04] been really going through it
[1:09:07] rejoice and be exceedingly glad for so
[1:09:10] persecuted they the prophets which are
[1:09:12] before you so don't go around with a
[1:09:15] hung down face and say well I ought to
[1:09:19] have done it guess I should I guess I
[1:09:22] can't stand for somebody to talk about
[1:09:23] me I say I'm oldfashioned I I tell
[1:09:26] you should be exceedingly
[1:09:28] glad happy because you can bear the
[1:09:32] reproach for his name and by keeping his
[1:09:35] Commandments has caed you to do that by
[1:09:38] having his life has caused you to be
[1:09:40] able to
[1:09:41] stand I think about the disciples Jesus
[1:09:44] said follow me and they would follow him
[1:09:46] for some time matter of fact there'd be
[1:09:48] many that would leave and he would look
[1:09:49] at them and say well you go also and
[1:09:51] Peter said where where else shall we go
[1:09:53] only you have the words to eternal life
[1:09:56] but if you get down all the way down to
[1:09:58] it every one of them left
[1:10:01] him the Bible says in the garden when
[1:10:04] they come to get him there and they come
[1:10:06] to take him the disciples fled now Peter
[1:10:09] he followed him for a little further but
[1:10:11] before it was over he denied
[1:10:14] him and I but if you want to look at at
[1:10:17] that story doesn't end right there but
[1:10:19] he brought them together again he said
[1:10:22] look I want to bring you to a place and
[1:10:24] when you when you gather Jerusalem you
[1:10:25] shall be endued with power from on high
[1:10:28] and they got they got the Holy Ghost
[1:10:30] Inside of them and now they had the
[1:10:32] power amen with their faith to go and
[1:10:36] follow him no matter where he went Peter
[1:10:38] would go and be hung upside down Paul
[1:10:40] would be aide s aund all the disciples
[1:10:43] would give their life for this gospel
[1:10:45] yes sir why because the spirit of Christ
[1:10:48] had come on the inside of them why cuz
[1:10:50] they let it all
[1:10:52] go to follow him
[1:11:01] amen he said but I want to say this too
[1:11:05] this is after all the bad stuff
[1:11:07] persecutions the hurts things you go
[1:11:10] through but I want to say this too God
[1:11:14] will not in no wise be in debt to any
[1:11:21] man God won't be deaded to any man if
[1:11:24] you had if you've done it for God God
[1:11:27] will repay you a
[1:11:31] thousandfold that's right God will pay
[1:11:34] it back you've forsaken the things of
[1:11:36] the world and the things of your
[1:11:38] families and thing God will repay you so
[1:11:40] many times how many's a witness of that
[1:11:43] we all know that God will
[1:11:46] repay God will give back amen you can
[1:11:49] look at our first father of Faith
[1:11:51] Abraham Abraham forsook his own land the
[1:11:54] property of the home and everything else
[1:11:56] and was called out of
[1:11:59] Chala if you look at it I don't know
[1:12:01] what all Abraham had but maybe he just
[1:12:03] had a lot and a city and a and a house
[1:12:05] and that's all he had and here's the
[1:12:07] word come and follow me and he starts
[1:12:10] following him and he's given a whole
[1:12:17] country why because he forsook his
[1:12:19] little
[1:12:20] house he was forsook the little land
[1:12:23] that he had and his home and all and he
[1:12:26] followed at God he left it
[1:12:34] behind he said he forsook it and he said
[1:12:38] Abraham you look east west north south
[1:12:40] I'll give it all of it to you it's all
[1:12:44] yours he said that's what's the matter
[1:12:46] with Christians God gives it all to us
[1:12:49] but we're afraid to go investigate
[1:12:53] it step out follow him
[1:12:55] him when you become a Christian you're
[1:12:58] an heir to every promise in the
[1:13:01] Bible right everything that God promis
[1:13:03] you is like a great big arcade or a big
[1:13:07] store big store and by one Spirit we're
[1:13:10] baptized into this big arcade or store
[1:13:13] amen which is Christ he said I think
[1:13:16] what we ought to do as Christians find
[1:13:18] out what we
[1:13:20] got amen walk over there and see what's
[1:13:23] over there then walk over there see
[1:13:25] what's over there well you walk over
[1:13:27] here and you'll find hey hey there's a
[1:13:28] provision here for my
[1:13:31] healing I claim that and you walk over
[1:13:34] here and you'll find that there's a now
[1:13:36] you may go through a lot of hardships
[1:13:38] getting over here but you're walking
[1:13:40] through your possession God's given you
[1:13:43] and you get over here and say well
[1:13:45] there's provision there for my children
[1:13:47] I'll take that and you keep walking and
[1:13:49] following after Christ and you're
[1:13:51] battling and you're battling and you're
[1:13:53] battling but you're walking in your
[1:13:55] promised land and the devil the whole
[1:13:57] time is trying to tell you this ain't
[1:13:58] for you that ain't for you that ain't
[1:14:00] for you who are you devil God told me
[1:14:02] it's mine amen he told me to look east
[1:14:05] west south and north all that I see is
[1:14:07] mine and that's way I believe we ought
[1:14:09] to do as Believers look in the Bible
[1:14:11] look in the word look in the message of
[1:14:13] the hour and see what God has truly
[1:14:16] given us young people you need to look
[1:14:19] and see what God has given you he didn't
[1:14:22] just give it to your mam or your daddies
[1:14:24] he gave it to every every one of
[1:14:30] you but you going to have to forsake
[1:14:33] all but it's going to be worth
[1:14:38] it it's going to be worth
[1:14:44] it may have to give up some things but
[1:14:47] it's going to be worth it but really
[1:14:49] what are you giving

[1:14:59] decision science itself is telling you
[1:15:02] it's killing you we got to give up
[1:15:04] drinking is that really that hard of a
[1:15:06] decision when you see the thousands of
[1:15:09] murders are done by drunk drivers and
[1:15:12] and the houses homes that are destroyed
[1:15:14] by drunk father is it really that heart
[1:15:16] of a
[1:15:19] decision well I had to give up my
[1:15:22] pornography is it really that hard of a
[1:15:24] decision

[1:15:32] life destroy your life destroy your
[1:15:34] family destroy your marriage destroy
[1:15:37] everything about

[1:15:45] decision well let me just ask you we
[1:15:47] we're going to put some scales here on
[1:15:49] this side is is is eternal value on this
[1:15:52] side is Earthly value yes so let's put
[1:15:55] Eternal value over here yes eternal life
[1:15:59] this is use just one eternal
[1:16:02] life there's a lot goes into eternal
[1:16:05] life but eternal life and then we're
[1:16:08] going to put drinking over here as a
[1:16:10] scale moved any smoke it over here has a
[1:16:13] scale moved any any kind of form of sin
[1:16:17] has a scale moved
[1:16:21] any it don't compare
[1:16:25] this Earth does not compare to what
[1:16:27] we're going to
[1:16:32] get that's a good one brother I'm I'm
[1:16:34] might to drop that one sometimes he back
[1:16:36] there he's just dropping it you know you
[1:16:37] just got to pick it up and use it
[1:16:40] heaven's got the best extra exchange
[1:16:43] rate there
[1:16:48] is I can go to a country sometimes and
[1:16:51] man I can throw my little $100 on there
[1:16:53] and get a thousands of there
[1:16:55] or maybe a million of theirs I've been
[1:16:57] to countries brother Tim's been to them
[1:16:59] you had to go pay your hotel bill you
[1:17:00] take a suitcase slam full of money it's
[1:17:03] worthless paper but and all the reality
[1:17:05] but it's what you take yeah but you
[1:17:08] probably gave what 80 bucks to get a
[1:17:10] suitcase
[1:17:11] full but you're not you're not any
[1:17:15] richer matter of fact you probably can
[1:17:17] buy
[1:17:19] less but this ain't the way Heavens
[1:17:22] that's this ain't the how Heavens EX
[1:17:24] change rate works listen when you take
[1:17:27] on his life you can get more that's
[1:17:30] right yes sir amen when you take on his
[1:17:34] life you give up a lot less than what
[1:17:37] you
[1:17:39] get listen nothing that you can add up
[1:17:42] this whole world you can add up the best
[1:17:44] times of your
[1:17:45] life the best days of your life maybe
[1:17:49] you lived on this Earth maybe you live
[1:17:51] on it 80 years and out of those 80 years
[1:17:53] you could count 500 days I don't know
[1:17:55] just coming up with something simple 500
[1:17:57] Days of the best days of my
[1:18:00] life
[1:18:02] yeah and you trade it for eternal
[1:18:08] life trying to break it down to young
[1:18:10] people can understand it's not what
[1:18:12] you're giving up it's what you're
[1:18:16] giving it's what you're getting what
[1:18:19] you're receiving right it ain't about
[1:18:21] what we give up it's peanuts
[1:18:29] it's peanuts when you when you look at
[1:18:31] it you might as well just have a bag of
[1:18:33] when you get through with your life and
[1:18:34] you lived 80 years you might as well
[1:18:36] just ate a bag of peanuts it's all it is
[1:18:40] in exchange for eternal life in exchange
[1:18:43] for something so we can't even describe
[1:18:47] as far as humanly speaking right now I
[1:18:49] can't even give words amen the Bible
[1:18:51] says eyes have not seen ears have not
[1:18:53] heard what is in store for
[1:18:57] those so the best days of your life your
[1:19:00] best vacation your best time your best
[1:19:03] birthday party your best everything does
[1:19:06] not compare to what awaits you on the
[1:19:08] other
[1:19:11] side it's worth going through the
[1:19:13] struggle it's worth going through the
[1:19:15] torment it's worth going through the
[1:19:17] situation you're in why cuz just on the
[1:19:19] other side is the greatest time of my
[1:19:22] life
[1:19:36] he
[1:19:37] says I think we ought to Christians
[1:19:40] ought to do is find out what we
[1:19:42] got sometimes it gets a little high up
[1:19:45] so we can't maybe reach it but I just
[1:19:47] get me a step later reach out of the
[1:19:50] Bible that God promised and lay my stay
[1:19:53] on my knees climb Jacob's Ladder until I
[1:19:56] reach it cuz it's mine God gave it to me
[1:19:58] he said if Divine Healing is Promised in
[1:20:00] the Bible and I'm sick I'll stay there
[1:20:02] till God gives it to me cuz it's a
[1:20:04] promise God promised it I'll forsake the
[1:20:06] world he give me the Holy Ghost I'll
[1:20:09] stay right there till he gives it to me
[1:20:11] because he promised it to me if God
[1:20:12] promised to give me the desires of my
[1:20:14] heart and the desires of my heart is the
[1:20:15] right thing I'll stay there till God
[1:20:17] gives it because it's a promise I've
[1:20:19] forsaken all the world I want to walk
[1:20:21] with him and he will pay all right it is
[1:20:25] I want to walk W with him I want to walk
[1:20:27] after him and he will
[1:20:31] pay sir you will never get something
[1:20:33] from him that says insufficient
[1:20:37] funds but he has a he's a king that owns
[1:20:39] a cattle on a th Hills and if it is
[1:20:42] there in his word it he will bring it to
[1:20:45] pass it doesn't matter what we say or
[1:20:47] what we do he will bring it to
[1:20:53] pass but Abraham he forsook his land his
[1:20:56] country and God gave him the
[1:20:58] entire
[1:21:00] entire portion of of Palestine he
[1:21:03] forsook his little bitty piece of land
[1:21:06] down there maybe an acre where his house
[1:21:08] set and it was an old house prophet of
[1:21:11] God received everything there was in
[1:21:13] Palestine that's a good exchange for the
[1:21:16] first time but the first thing he had to
[1:21:18] do was separate himself you know first
[1:21:22] Abraham come out but he brought his dad
[1:21:24] with him he brought lot with him his Kim
[1:21:26] but God didn't call all them he called
[1:21:31] him and I know sometimes that's the way
[1:21:33] we want it we want to bring everybody
[1:21:34] with us but sometimes God just called
[1:21:37] you and he had to walk away separate
[1:21:41] himself from his father and separate
[1:21:43] himself from lot and then when all of
[1:21:45] that happened then he can meet the angel
[1:21:48] under the oak
[1:21:49] tree then he could receive the promise
[1:21:52] for the body change and receive the
[1:21:54] promised child then God could do all
[1:21:57] those things why cuz he had forsook all
[1:21:59] he had forsook everything that was
[1:22:01] around him and mean God did Ne never did
[1:22:04] bless Abraham until he totally obeyed
[1:22:07] him as long as he had his daddy along
[1:22:10] and he said the old man was a fly in the
[1:22:12] Orman all time finally he died then lot
[1:22:14] was strife and everything and as soon as
[1:22:16] Abraham fully obeyed God and separated
[1:22:19] himself then lot got on down to the good
[1:22:21] lands where he wanted to go toward Sodom
[1:22:23] and got a appeared to Abraham lift up
[1:22:25] your eyes I give you the whole thing
[1:22:27] it's all yours Abraham was the one who
[1:22:31] separated he was the one who separated
[1:22:33] and F forsook all to follow after God
[1:22:36] and he's now known as the father of
[1:22:42] Faith so how are we going to be sons of
[1:22:44] Abraham if we don't have the attributes
[1:22:46] of
[1:22:48] Abraham we don't want to do what Abraham
[1:22:50] did but we want to get what Abraham got
[1:22:55] Israel forsook Egypt they forsook the
[1:22:58] old land down there in Egypt to receive
[1:23:00] what the promised
[1:23:02] land they came from a horrible place
[1:23:04] with taskmasters and slavery to get what
[1:23:08] their own place their own possessions
[1:23:10] their own
[1:23:17] land listen here he says you know he
[1:23:20] said there's a lot of people young
[1:23:21] people young women young men out
[1:23:23] drinking smoking doing things these
[1:23:26] police had to arrest a bunch of young
[1:23:28] women down there on the street the other
[1:23:30] day going Hog
[1:23:32] Wild wish they maybe do some of that
[1:23:34] today but anyway that Old Devil Spirit
[1:23:36] got in on them to do the little boogie
[1:23:38] woie or whatever you want to call it out
[1:23:40] there in the street going crazy in their
[1:23:42] mind but really if a young lady's got an
[1:23:44] ounce of dcent about her her and a young
[1:23:46] man either one that thing is a
[1:23:48] Taskmaster to drives them to do that you
[1:23:50] forsake that and God will give you a
[1:23:53] dance
[1:23:55] yes abely wow Oh my he sure will he'll
[1:23:59] give you one if you forsake that but you
[1:24:02] got to forsake all these things to
[1:24:04] haveen you cannot continue with both of
[1:24:16] them Israel left the Burning Sands of
[1:24:19] Egypt and the stripes on their
[1:24:21] back under that burning Sun to walk
[1:24:24] under the light of the pillar of fire
[1:24:27] they left all of that all of that
[1:24:29] taskmasters and all of that things that
[1:24:32] was burden them and bind them to walk
[1:24:35] with the pillar of fire what a
[1:24:40] trade and yet we have the same
[1:24:43] opportunity to walk with this Pillar of
[1:24:45] Fire not walk with him above us but walk
[1:24:47] with him in
[1:24:49] us I'm not saying he don't come above us
[1:24:51] in the church or around in your house or
[1:24:53] whatever sure but he is now not the God
[1:24:55] above us or with us but in
[1:24:57] us and we got that ability or that that
[1:25:00] that that chance to have that
[1:25:03] moment and yet we go right back to our
[1:25:06] slavery we go right back to the
[1:25:08] situations that we think are so
[1:25:11] important go right back to the things
[1:25:13] that we're so bound to and that we're
[1:25:16] actually
[1:25:21] slaves they left the garlic pots of
[1:25:23] Egypt
[1:25:25] to eat Angels food they left the
[1:25:28] stagnant Waters of Egypt to drink from
[1:25:31] the living W raw water from the rock
[1:25:33] they left all of
[1:25:35] that to fight what a trade I'm talking
[1:25:38] about trades here you know we're talking
[1:25:40] about exchange
[1:25:42] rates leave all that water of mud and
[1:25:45] mixed up with doubts and frustrations
[1:25:47] and arguments and stews and everything
[1:25:51] and and leave all of that to walk in in
[1:25:54] the
[1:25:55] light Amen to go with the Lord they left
[1:25:58] the boasting fish physicians of Egypt
[1:26:00] that we're the smartest men in the world
[1:26:02] we got the greatest signs we can do
[1:26:04] mummify we can do this we can do that to
[1:26:06] go with one who never let their satchels
[1:26:09] their their shoes fall apart their
[1:26:12] clothes didn't fall apart sickness
[1:26:14] didn't come in their
[1:26:17] midst what a trade they left those who
[1:26:21] were saying days of Miracles are pass
[1:26:23] and they left those that said there was
[1:26:25] no such a thing as a living God to walk
[1:26:28] with the miracle working God who could
[1:26:31] open a Red Sea who can make bitter water
[1:26:33] sweet who can do all of these
[1:26:43] things what did the disciples forsake
[1:26:46] what did they leave Nets
[1:26:52] fish toiling all
[1:26:57] night they tried on their own one night
[1:26:59] and toiling all night and they never
[1:27:01] caught a fish come to the one and said
[1:27:03] just pitch it on the other
[1:27:05] side well Lord we we've toiled all night
[1:27:08] we've tried we've done everything we're
[1:27:09] fishermen I don't know if you don't you
[1:27:11] don't know who we are we we that's what
[1:27:13] we do for a
[1:27:14] living that's who I am is I I am a
[1:27:17] Fisher I can do this but at Thy word
[1:27:22] they throw it over on the other side hi
[1:27:25] I I believe creation took
[1:27:27] place amen and it filled their Nets and
[1:27:30] filled their boats so they almost sunk
[1:27:32] them what a
[1:27:35] [Music]
[1:27:40] trade they forsaken their occupation
[1:27:43] they forsake forsook their Nets they
[1:27:46] forsook their fishing they forsook they
[1:27:48] forsook families they they forsook
[1:27:50] everything and would one day give their
[1:27:53] life
[1:27:54] for this
[1:27:57] gospel but
[1:27:59] today their names are lifted up as great
[1:28:04] men of
[1:28:07] faith and the one one of them was called
[1:28:10] said heard the same word follow me and
[1:28:12] he follows him to the place where he
[1:28:14] could give him a kiss and turn around
[1:28:17] and
[1:28:20] walk and walk
[1:28:22] away and and his name
[1:28:26] today I don't know I've lived 40 almost
[1:28:29] 48 years now I have not met one person
[1:28:31] named
[1:28:32] Judas
[1:28:35] anybody why cuz there's such a such
[1:28:39] a terrible thought to that name such a a
[1:28:43] stink a stench when you hear the name
[1:28:46] Judas
[1:28:47] why cuz he refused to go all the
[1:28:52] way and is name is cast down in history
[1:28:56] his name is you know that's what makes
[1:28:58] me so
[1:28:59] amazed at people that that don't believe
[1:29:02] that Jesus ever lived and all this I
[1:29:04] mean you got they got men that names are
[1:29:06] now forever and not just Jesus but Peter
[1:29:09] and Paul and all these on that are
[1:29:11] lifted up out of history and thought of
[1:29:13] as Heroes and a man who walked to the
[1:29:16] Gates of Heaven and walked
[1:29:20] away and people don't want to name their
[1:29:22] kid after him
[1:29:25] why because they don't want him to be
[1:29:27] like
[1:29:30] that I I didn't expected to go this way
[1:29:33] honestly I didn't have a lot of this in
[1:29:34] my own notes but God's calling
[1:29:39] somebody and he's saying follow
[1:29:43] me let's bow our heads I just we got to
[1:29:46] stop right there
[1:29:54] or you get out of your
[1:29:56] pride get out of your
[1:30:03] arrogance follow

[1:30:42] aund things brother Timothy that I'd
[1:30:44] have to give up well I think I can just
[1:30:47] think of one thing you could
[1:30:48] get eternal
[1:30:51] life balance that out if you can
[1:30:54] [Music]
[1:30:57] it's not a sand
[1:31:02] castle it's not just some hope
[1:31:05] so we can read right there in the Bible
[1:31:08] and we can see things that are happening
[1:31:09] right now that was written thousands of
[1:31:12] years
[1:31:13] ago we
[1:31:20] know prophecies are being fulfilled

[1:32:18] mind maybe you're not
[1:32:21] worthy but if you can push that down and

[1:32:58] and that's good it's for
[1:33:03] them sometimes we find oursel older ones
[1:33:08] we've allowed things to rise up too in
[1:33:10] our walk with Christ that we allowed to
[1:33:13] be more important and we allowed to take
[1:33:16] precedence over things and follow
[1:33:20] me it'll be worth it
[1:33:24] it'll be worth
[1:33:25] [Music]
