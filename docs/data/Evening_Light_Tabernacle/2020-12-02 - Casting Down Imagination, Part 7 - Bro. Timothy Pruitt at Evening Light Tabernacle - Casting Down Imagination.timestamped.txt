[29:20] and if you would this evening amen it's
[29:23] good to be in the house of the lord
[29:26] amen also john chapter 13 as well
[29:30] i'd like to continue on casting down
[29:33] imaginations
[29:38] amen
[29:42] casting down imaginations says
[29:45] chapter 55 and verse 8 says for my
[29:48] thoughts
[29:49] are not your thoughts neither are your
[29:51] ways my ways
[29:53] saith the lord for as the heavens
[29:56] are higher than the earth so are my ways
[30:00] higher than your ways and my thoughts
[30:03] than your thoughts praise the lord for
[30:06] that
[30:07] amen also john chapter 13 and verse 27
[30:12] and it says after the soph satan entered
[30:15] into him then said jesus unto him
[30:18] do that thou doest do quickly
[30:22] amen we'll let you be seated
[30:30] today i've been pondering thinking about
[30:33] no doubt
[30:34] am i trying to imagine the mind battles
[30:37] that judas must have had
[30:40] the imaginations that would run through
[30:42] his mind the thoughts that satan was
[30:44] constantly
[30:45] coming at him time after time after time
[30:48] you know as he did with eve you know i'm
[30:50] sure it wasn't the first
[30:52] time that the serpent would take talk to
[30:54] eve that the act was committed that
[30:56] caused the fall
[30:57] it was no doubt days years who knows how
[31:00] long
[31:00] that it would take for him to win the
[31:02] confidence of eve
[31:04] and this is how even satan would even
[31:05] come to judas's mind
[31:07] as he would come and he would begin to
[31:09] interject thoughts into his mind
[31:12] and you know and the miracles he had to
[31:14] witness and all the things he had heard
[31:16] and saw and no doubt the mind battles
[31:19] and the things that were taking place
[31:20] inside of him
[31:23] yet when it came down to it his thoughts
[31:25] overtook him
[31:27] his reasonings and his imaginations
[31:29] became bigger
[31:30] than his faith to where instead of
[31:33] healings and miracles
[31:35] and the word made flesh he only saw
[31:38] money in popularity
[31:40] amen satan got a hold of his head and
[31:42] from there and his thinking and from
[31:44] there
[31:44] entered into his heart and into his soul
[31:48] the or in other words his thoughts
[31:50] became his belief
[31:52] see judas had it in his mind but he
[31:55] refused to go all the way
[31:57] now we know brother branham would speak
[31:58] about how he he'd come right up to
[31:59] pentecost
[32:00] but he refused the baptism of the holy
[32:02] ghost he would get to thank
[32:04] to sanctification and justification all
[32:07] those places
[32:08] but he wouldn't go all the way and you
[32:11] know the bible would also
[32:12] would also speak of this in proverbs 23
[32:15] and verse 7
[32:16] it says for as he thinketh in his heart
[32:19] so is he now you know the heart does not
[32:22] think there's no place in the heart
[32:24] amen that physical heart to think but
[32:26] it's speaking of a spiritual place
[32:29] and you know when brother brandon would
[32:30] talk about this place that there was
[32:32] actually a young lady that brought him
[32:34] an
[32:34] article that was put out by science it
[32:36] was in a newspaper article and she
[32:38] said brother branham i'll show you
[32:40] something i heard you say about a man
[32:42] thinking in his heart he said i read it
[32:44] in the bible she said now today
[32:46] they've they found it and proved it it's
[32:49] not
[32:50] there's not it's not in no other heart
[32:52] but the human heart
[32:53] it isn't even in an animal heart
[32:55] anywhere but there's a little
[32:56] compartment
[32:57] in the heart that science says is the
[32:59] place where the soul abides
[33:01] therefore god was right when he said a
[33:03] man think as a man
[33:04] thinketh in his heart there is a mental
[33:07] faculty in the heart it's called the
[33:10] soul amen
[33:11] and in all all of you he has he said has
[33:13] had this times
[33:15] when you would think something you'd say
[33:16] well i don't know whether it could
[33:17] happen or not and all of a sudden
[33:19] something would begin to speak out or
[33:22] once something would begin to happen
[33:24] he said we've all had those kind of
[33:25] experience he said when
[33:27] regardless of what any all of a sudden
[33:29] something says it's going to happen
[33:31] regardless of any what anybody says he
[33:33] said we all had that
[33:35] he said that's when your heart is
[33:36] thinking and when it's dropped from here
[33:39] down into your heart
[33:40] it becomes a settled thing you know amen
[33:42] you can't as we've been talking about
[33:44] imaginations you can't stop thoughts
[33:46] from coming to your mind you can't
[33:48] keep that from happening but what you
[33:49] want to be careful is that thought don't
[33:51] drop down into your heart
[33:53] because when that thought drops down
[33:55] into your heart amen it becomes your
[33:57] belief
[33:58] amen now we know we know that the seal
[34:00] of god changes everything that
[34:02] that all no matter what kind of thought
[34:04] comes it can never get into that place
[34:07] amen but see thinking and thoughts as
[34:09] you begin you know i thought about it
[34:10] with homosexual thinking
[34:12] amen maybe it starts out very subtle and
[34:15] very easy
[34:16] and very light you know and very basic
[34:19] thoughts but against
[34:20] to get deeper and deeper until it can
[34:22] finally
[34:23] fall into that heart towards no more a
[34:26] thought of homosexuality
[34:28] it's a belief that that's who i am and
[34:30] this is where
[34:31] even judas would come to that he would
[34:33] no longer just think about it
[34:35] he would actually begin to pull it would
[34:37] fall from here
[34:38] into his soul realm to where he would
[34:41] actually walk
[34:42] and walk there and deny the very jesus
[34:44] called christ
[34:45] and we're seeing men and women this hour
[34:47] that we're living in
[34:48] that has thought about it they thought
[34:50] about the message they've had it in
[34:51] their mind they're thinking about it
[34:53] they've kept it there it's been an
[34:54] intellectual revelation amen this never
[34:57] came into their heart it's never fell
[35:00] down to where it actually became what
[35:01] they believed
[35:02] no matter what anybody says amen we can
[35:06] see people that actually say i believe
[35:08] the message but then somebody can say
[35:09] something
[35:10] contrary or bring some kind of thing up
[35:12] here over here
[35:13] and all of a sudden it destroys their
[35:15] whole their whole thought process
[35:17] because it wasn't really what they
[35:19] believed because once it gets down into
[35:22] the heart
[35:22] there's no change in it once it gets
[35:25] down into that realm of the soul
[35:27] amen when you realize it's not my what i
[35:29] think in my mind but it's what i believe
[35:31] in my heart
[35:31] that it's over with the devil can come
[35:33] the devil can question the devil can
[35:35] bring whatever
[35:36] he wants to bring up it does not matter
[35:38] no more
[35:39] it's there it's placed inside of you
[35:41] amen and he said see the mind
[35:44] reasons but the heart doesn't reason it
[35:46] just believes
[35:48] he said if i could ever drive home to my
[35:51] audience
[35:52] i am into he said to have a real amen a
[35:54] real healing service if i could ever get
[35:56] my audience to see that
[35:58] it's not what your head thinks at all
[36:01] that's where the devil comes but he'll
[36:02] reason it all out
[36:04] i'm sick i can't get well i'm saved i
[36:06] can't get
[36:07] i can't i'm sin i have full of sin i
[36:09] can't be saved
[36:10] i've done too much see that's reasoning
[36:13] but you've got to cast
[36:14] down those reasonings and believe with
[36:16] your heart
[36:18] amen amen if you're not careful what you
[36:21] think will become your belief
[36:23] that ain't that what that'll be no
[36:24] longer be i think i can't be saved but
[36:27] you'll become
[36:27] i you'll believe it and then it's
[36:29] impossible to get to get anywhere with
[36:31] god
[36:32] that's what happened in the garden of
[36:33] eden man was divided in two parts the
[36:36] devil took his head
[36:37] and god took his heart the devil makes
[36:40] him look at things and say well it just
[36:42] can't happen
[36:43] it'll reason it all out but god took his
[36:45] heart to dwell
[36:46] in his heart to make him believe things
[36:49] that his head don't even know anything
[36:51] about
[36:52] i don't know yet that's right so it's
[36:54] your heart it's in your heart you think
[36:56] down here
[36:57] that's where the real certain sound
[36:59] comes from it's from the heart
[37:01] when where god talks is in the heart but
[37:03] up here is where the devil talks
[37:05] but let's cast down what the devil says
[37:08] and take what god says
[37:10] let's cast down the uncertain sound and
[37:13] can take the certain sound what god
[37:15] is saying in our heart amen he said a
[37:18] man thinks with his head
[37:19] but he believes with his heart the devil
[37:22] thinks through his mind to show him
[37:24] something with his eye
[37:25] but his heart will make him believe
[37:26] something that'll be impossible to ever
[37:29] see
[37:30] you may not ever see it with your eye
[37:32] but you'll still believe it why
[37:34] you're not believing with this right
[37:36] here you're believing with your heart
[37:38] amen you may not ever feel it you may
[37:40] not ever see it you may not ever taste
[37:42] it
[37:42] you may not it has nothing to do with it
[37:44] because it's not connected
[37:46] with this brain mentality anymore it's
[37:48] fell
[37:49] from here down into your heart and this
[37:51] is what he says we said we've got to get
[37:53] from our head into our heart
[37:57] hallelujah amen our walk with christ has
[37:59] to get from our head
[38:01] into our hearts a service has to get
[38:04] from our head
[38:05] into our hearts every day with god has
[38:08] to get from our head
[38:09] into our heart to where it becomes our
[38:11] belief
[38:13] not what i think but what i believe
[38:16] those two different things
[38:19] people mix those up they think what they
[38:21] think is their belief but no
[38:22] it's got to go deeper than that because
[38:25] many people have thought the message is
[38:27] right
[38:27] but today they don't believe it
[38:31] amen why because it never fell into
[38:33] their heart
[38:34] amen something was always there as a
[38:36] question he said if we could ever get
[38:38] away from our head knowledge
[38:40] and head religion to a heart religion
[38:43] where god
[38:44] could go to work amen out of our head
[38:47] and into our heart a man believes in his
[38:50] heart
[38:51] and he but he thinks with his head the
[38:53] mind reasons the heart never reasons
[38:55] it just believes what god says but you
[38:58] see today we're so scientific we got to
[39:00] have it proved
[39:01] we got to have this but you know in the
[39:03] old days when somebody said the lord did
[39:05] a miracle
[39:05] they just believed it they thought
[39:07] that's right thank the lord for it but
[39:08] today
[39:09] it's got to be scientifically proven
[39:12] are we not seeing that in the message
[39:14] now now all of a sudden the message has
[39:16] to be scientifically proven
[39:18] listen you can't scientifically prove
[39:20] god
[39:21] it's impossible i mean men have blown
[39:25] their brains out trying to
[39:26] scientifically
[39:27] prove god there's always an attribute of
[39:30] god you'll never
[39:31] be able to scientifically prove you'll
[39:33] never be able to prove it with this
[39:35] brain amen
[39:36] it's impossible god so far his thoughts
[39:39] are higher than our thoughts
[39:41] as high as the heaven is above and so is
[39:44] his heart
[39:44] thoughts higher than our that's that's
[39:46] in that's an innumerable amount
[39:49] amen they're still looking into the
[39:51] skies and they found the end of it
[39:53] and he's trying to tell you my thoughts
[39:55] are this much higher than your thoughts
[39:58] i'm thinking if i'm thankful his
[40:00] thoughts are higher than my thoughts
[40:02] in other words what he thought of me
[40:03] overrides what i think of me
[40:06] amen what he thinks of me overrides what
[40:08] you think of me
[40:11] hallelujah amen what he thinks of me
[40:13] overrides what the devil thinks of me
[40:18] but it's got to fall into the heart if
[40:21] it does not get to the heart
[40:23] amen the devil can talk you out of it
[40:27] amen if somebody talked you into it
[40:28] somebody talk you out of it
[40:30] amen this is not what the message is
[40:32] about it's a belief
[40:35] amen it was just like mary amen mary one
[40:38] time was trying to figure it out she was
[40:40] trying to
[40:40] reason the scriptures and and the
[40:42] prophet isaiah said that said this and
[40:44] i heard the the fair the the preacher
[40:47] said this and
[40:48] what am i going to do about it all of a
[40:50] sudden she has a visitation
[40:51] and she says she sees all the things
[40:53] laid out before what happened she didn't
[40:55] respond with her mind
[40:57] she responded with her heart her heart
[41:00] said be it unto me according to thy word
[41:02] amen
[41:03] that's why we got to make sure our
[41:05] thinking is lined up with the word of
[41:07] god
[41:08] because your thinking will become your
[41:10] belief
[41:18] you know but people's got to have
[41:20] everything proved you know we're we're
[41:22] in the time of proving everything
[41:24] you know and they're trying to prove
[41:26] today what happened
[41:28] 40 50 60 70 80 even almost 100 years ago
[41:33] and they're and they're willing to take
[41:35] amen what somebody else says or what
[41:37] somebody else's questions
[41:40] uh somebody had talked to me about a man
[41:43] that was coming to him question the
[41:45] message and
[41:46] said i need you to answer these
[41:47] questions
[41:49] the man looked at him gave him a real
[41:50] good reply he said those ain't my
[41:53] questions
[41:55] those are your questions i don't have to
[41:58] answer them because i ain't question i
[41:59] don't have those questions amen what is
[42:02] it the devil tries to put things in your
[42:04] mind
[42:04] constantly i know he does even as young
[42:07] people or even older people
[42:08] and thoughts are constantly bombard and
[42:11] that's why it's important
[42:12] you you filter them out you realize is
[42:14] this thought lined up with the word of
[42:15] god
[42:16] nope cast it down amen is this with the
[42:18] word of god nope put it aside
[42:20] that's not who i am that's not what i
[42:22] believe
[42:24] amen you know what if moses would have
[42:27] said wait a minute here
[42:29] let me stop what kind of chemical spray
[42:31] has been put on that tree
[42:33] what kind of leaves are all that's on
[42:35] fire but they're not burning that must
[42:37] be some kind of synthetic
[42:38] and try to figure it all out that wasn't
[42:40] what it was about he said
[42:42] oh wait you know maybe i need to pick up
[42:43] some of them leaves and take them to a
[42:45] laboratory and get it all
[42:46] analyzed and try to analyze it all
[42:50] you know we want to analyze everything
[42:52] and everything's got to match up just
[42:54] right
[42:54] listen you you can't even get the
[42:56] there's let's just be honest there's
[42:58] things in this bible
[42:59] as far as humanly thinking you'll never
[43:01] match up altogether right
[43:06] because god is trying to tell you
[43:08] something it's not about how you can put
[43:10] it together
[43:11] with your mind it's to him that says yes
[43:13] lord i believe it
[43:16] no matter what it says i believe it
[43:24] he said if he would have had any of
[43:26] those kind of thoughts
[43:29] if if moses would have had those kind of
[43:31] thoughts god would have never
[43:33] said take off your shoes
[43:36] mercy think about that one for a moment
[43:39] if it
[43:40] had any of those kind of thoughts about
[43:42] the moment god come down in that burning
[43:44] bush and
[43:45] he'd had those kind of thoughts god
[43:46] would have never said take off his shoes
[43:49] he would have never spoke to him well
[43:51] what did he do he walked up humbly he
[43:53] didn't care what the fire was
[43:55] if it was burning how is burning whether
[43:57] a tree burned up or not
[43:59] he was searching for god he needed
[44:02] god and every child of god will believe
[44:05] the same way
[44:06] he'll hear the same voice take off your
[44:08] shoes
[44:10] you're on holy ground amen i'm here to
[44:12] visit you
[44:14] i'm here to touch your heart i'm here to
[44:16] change your life
[44:22] you know i mean yeah as he said it goes
[44:25] on he said you know people can come
[44:26] anywhere and they can
[44:27] pick apart anything they can analyze
[44:29] every anything you know people make too
[44:31] much noise the preacher preaches too
[44:33] long
[44:33] uh i can scientifically tell you there's
[44:35] there's people there that's weary
[44:37] they all not stay up that long you know
[44:39] and listen to all that
[44:40] go ahead but those who come with their
[44:43] shoes off
[44:45] come on now those who come with their
[44:47] shoes off
[44:49] and their knowledge left behind and a
[44:51] heart opened up to god
[44:52] you'll hear them say i am the
[44:54] resurrection in life
[44:56] those that are willing to lay aside
[44:58] their pride and say yes lord
[44:59] i it's not what i think anyhow
[45:02] i i don't even know how it's gonna be
[45:04] it's not how i think anyhow
[45:07] it's how you are lord it's your thoughts
[45:10] god it's your word god
[45:11] it's you lord that's all that matters
[45:22] he said that's the reason the little
[45:23] compartment's in your heart god mowed
[45:25] you that way
[45:26] a little place in your heart
[45:30] satan will come to the mind but the
[45:31] heart belongs to god
[45:33] god made himself a little room there it
[45:35] could he could sit in the controlling
[45:37] tower that he could guide you
[45:39] oh blessed be his holy name we could let
[45:42] him be the pilot the holy ghost of col
[45:44] the co-pilot he'd be got we we would be
[45:46] guided over the sea of life in this
[45:48] control room
[45:49] well what did man do he listened to his
[45:51] fellow man
[45:52] and he accepted the devil there and the
[45:54] devil came in
[45:55] and begins to guide him
[45:58] no wonder people came to believe in
[46:00] divine healing with the devil sitting
[46:02] there saying don't you believe it
[46:06] no wonder why people they can't believe
[46:07] in in a prayer line when the devil's
[46:09] sitting there saying it ain't so no more
[46:12] no wonder why people can't believe it
[46:14] and then the supernatural move of god
[46:17] when people are saying it's a day gone
[46:18] by listen
[46:20] what people are saying are actually what
[46:21] spirits have said
[46:25] come on somebody amen the words that
[46:27] comes out of our mouth but no man can
[46:29] serve two masters
[46:31] we either serve in one or the other amen
[46:34] words are thoughts expressed
[46:36] where are the thoughts coming from
[46:39] people don't understand when they hear a
[46:41] thought that says you can't get up or
[46:43] you can't get well that's actually a
[46:45] spirit talking to you
[46:47] that's a devil talking to you that's a
[46:49] spirit that's trying to
[46:51] keep you in that condition and keep you
[46:53] bound and
[46:54] keep you down and keep you uh uh you
[46:56] know
[46:57] bound in sin and unbelief that is a
[46:59] spirit there
[47:00] but there is another there is another
[47:02] voice
[47:05] hallelujah amen just like those voices
[47:07] in that chicken yard
[47:08] of that chicken barking this and back
[47:10] and forth remember there was another
[47:12] voice
[47:13] and it caught that little eagle's
[47:14] attention amen and it turned his eye
[47:17] somewhere else
[47:22] hallelujah listen the further we go
[47:25] along
[47:26] the more the chickens are going to
[47:27] squawk
[47:30] say days of miracles are passed and it's
[47:32] impossible

[48:04] prophet and saying
[48:05] well he made this mistake and he made
[48:06] that mistake and he made this mistake

[48:26] eagles fly
[48:31] and they're about to witness the
[48:32] greatest eagle migration
[48:35] ever

[48:40] barnyard
[48:41] this whole world is so tired of it i
[48:44] don't know about you but i'm tired of it
[48:46] this whole world that's over this side

[49:08] and they think well i just thought no
[49:10] that's a spirit that's talking to you
[49:13] that's a spirit that's interjecting
[49:15] things and trying to get you distracted
[49:18] and trying to get your eyes off of
[49:19] what's really important
[49:21] trying to get you amen over on some
[49:23] other thing somewhere

[49:46] the word of god
[49:47] amen i'm holding the line i'm i'm
[49:50] holding right here

[49:53] what ain't the word of god i cast down
[49:56] i lay it aside
[49:59] that's what abraham had to do god told
[50:02] him he's going to have a child
[50:03] ridiculous it sounded
[50:07] pretty ridiculous at a 65 year old and
[50:10] 75 year old
[50:11] man and woman walking downtown to buy
[50:13] some bobby pins and bird eye
[50:16] diapers pretty ridiculous
[50:21] to the human mind
[50:27] abraham have you ever had a baby before
[50:30] no
[50:30] how old are you sarah 65 how old are you
[50:32] abraham 75
[50:34] what are you doing with all those things
[50:36] for a baby we're going to have one
[50:39] well i i i can scientifically prove you
[50:42] she's 25 20 years 25 years past
[50:45] menopause you're
[50:46] you're a bunch of ignorant people but
[50:48] abraham called those things which are
[50:50] not as though they were why
[50:52] because god said so god had placed it in
[50:56] his heart
[50:57] and it wasn't going to make making him
[50:58] move away from it
[51:00] 25 years 30 years whatever it was he was
[51:03] going to hold to the line
[51:05] the line is the word of god oh come on
[51:09] now
[51:09] amen we've been we've been in this
[51:11] message now 50 something years
[51:13] what a 60 years since the prophet left
[51:15] nearly
[51:20] so
[51:24] the chickens are squawking so
[51:28] people are making fun so
[51:31] people are denying and walking away i
[51:33] can't help it
[51:36] judas did that
[51:39] why because they allow the thoughts to
[51:42] become their belief
[51:47] it don't matter yet time does not matter
[51:49] to god
[51:51] amen yeah you know a minute a second
[51:54] you know years that matters a lot to us
[51:57] you know especially if you get older
[51:59] you're used to 20 years matter now 10
[52:01] years matter five years matter one year
[52:03] matters
[52:04] one day matters depends on how old you
[52:06] are but to god it don't matter
[52:08] he could care less of his 20 years 30
[52:10] years 100 years
[52:12] thousand years time is is irrelevant to
[52:14] god
[52:16] it does not determine his word
[52:18] thankfully is not determined by
[52:19] time allotments we put time to god but
[52:22] god doesn't put time to himself
[52:24] god speaks the word and it comes to pass
[52:28] amen no matter how it's said or what how
[52:30] long it takes how difficult it becomes
[52:33] when god says it it comes to pass and
[52:35] when he said i have a bribe without spot
[52:37] with rent without wrinkle
[52:38] he said it that's his thoughts it's not
[52:40] my thoughts i don't know how he's going
[52:41] to do it
[52:42] i see him possibilities i do i mean as
[52:45] far as humanly speaking you say god
[52:46] how's it going to be
[52:47] i don't know how is it going to be he
[52:49] just said it was going to be
[52:51] a body change how's that going to happen
[52:53] that's impossible
[52:55] for a human body to go back to a young
[52:56] body young bones young organs young
[52:59] everything how is that possible i don't
[53:00] know how it's possible
[53:02] god said so that's all that matters
[53:12] didn't matter if sarah was feeling good
[53:14] or bad
[53:16] she felt pregnant or not didn't have one
[53:18] thing to do with it
[53:20] god said so it didn't matter
[53:24] if if if she felt it or not no different
[53:27] don't matter
[53:28] we're going to have it anyhow why
[53:31] because it had come from here into here
[53:34] i mean it went beyond a human ability to
[53:37] think
[53:38] and to comprehend and to put it all
[53:40] together abraham
[53:41] obviously was not relying on this little
[53:43] p brain
[53:45] or he gave up a long time ago
[53:49] but he was holding on to it with his
[53:50] heart
[53:53] 20 years past didn't matter god said so
[53:56] it wasn't in his head it was in his
[53:59] heart
[54:01] god don't speak in the head he speaks in
[54:03] the heart that's where god lives
[54:05] if god is on the throne he stirs you to
[54:08] believe for the impossible oh
[54:10] my hallelujah he makes you go and see
[54:13] things
[54:13] that he wants you to go and see oh my he
[54:17] turned your eyes from what the
[54:18] the things that the devil talks about
[54:20] and you stay right with god the bible
[54:23] said it i'm going to believe it
[54:24] no matter what takes place i'm going to
[54:27] hold on i'm a child of abraham
[54:29] just like abraham did i will do
[54:34] hallelujah but the devil is constantly
[54:36] trying to get through that channel of
[54:38] the mind
[54:41] he did it with brother branham he did it
[54:43] with it did it with all the
[54:44] people through the bible he did it with
[54:46] jesus
[54:48] i mean goodness he done it he does it
[54:49] with everybody that's where he comes to
[54:51] the channel of the mind
[54:55] you know he would make this statement he
[54:58] said i've made many mistakes
[55:00] and still make them and we'll always
[55:03] make them
[55:05] so for you negative message people out
[55:08] there
[55:08] he admitted he made mistakes just like
[55:12] any real man would do
[55:14] we all make them still make them and
[55:16] when i make them the holy spirit tells
[55:17] me that i'm wrong
[55:18] and then i repent right there lord
[55:20] forgive me didn't mean to do it you help
[55:22] me now
[55:22] and i walk right on the same thing
[55:24] because no sooner than it goes from my
[55:26] lips
[55:27] the devils will say no sooner than it
[55:30] goes from my lips
[55:31] if we confess our sins he will forgive
[55:33] him is that right but
[55:35] no sooner it goes from my lips the devil
[55:37] says you know what
[55:38] i'll tell you you were supposed to do a
[55:40] certain thing and you didn't do it
[55:44] he said you know what i tell him i
[55:46] confessed it already
[55:49] it's already under the blood don't talk
[55:52] to me about it
[55:54] i confess my wrongs and he forgive me
[55:57] how do i know
[55:58] he said he would
[56:01] and i don't talk to him about it no more
[56:04] i just keep moving on
[56:08] come on now that's where you got to stop
[56:10] the devil in this tracks many of you
[56:12] young people in different ones
[56:13] he's come at you and said well look what
[56:15] you've done look at your past look at
[56:17] your mistake
[56:17] i've now confessed it already it's in
[56:20] the blood of jesus christ
[56:22] and he don't even know what you're
[56:23] talking about
[56:25] and you walk on and ignore him
[56:29] cast down imaginations
[56:38] he says he goes on another one he says
[56:42] he said i see a crutch sitting back here
[56:44] by a lady
[56:45] if the devil can make her believe she's
[56:49] going to have to use that crutch to go
[56:51] out of here on
[56:52] it's whipped how does he make her
[56:56] believe
[56:57] thoughts if the devil can make her
[57:00] believe she's going to have to use that
[57:02] crutch to get out of here
[57:03] it's whipped but when she won't look at
[57:06] that crutch
[57:07] but she'll look at god's promise it'll
[57:10] be left at the seat
[57:14] praise the lord i pray a lot of crutches
[57:16] can be left at the seat tonight
[57:19] amen it don't have to be a physical
[57:21] crutch we can talk about spiritual
[57:22] crutches
[57:23] complexes and fears and all that just
[57:26] leave it at the seat
[57:27] look at the promise of god and say yes
[57:29] lord your promises are
[57:31] yeah and amen your thoughts are higher
[57:33] than my thoughts
[57:35] i can't figure it out so i'm just going
[57:36] to leave it here at the seat hallelujah
[57:40] you have the ability to walk out of this
[57:43] building a free person
[57:45] by changing your look and your thinking
[57:47] and begin to think on the word of god
[57:49] and deny that imagination
[57:53] it says you have to stay bound you don't
[57:54] have to stay bound
[58:01] but if she'll say i've been crippled for
[58:04] years
[58:06] that don't have nothing to do with it
[58:08] it's what god said
[58:11] see satan he said satan did this to me a
[58:14] while ago
[58:15] he says he told me while coming up here
[58:17] to preach you're too hoarse to preach
[58:19] satan now we would have thought that's
[58:22] just a thought
[58:26] really and you know you know what i'm
[58:27] saying with that's just me thinking
[58:29] because i mean i am hoarse and you know
[58:31] i it's hard to preach when you're horse
[58:34] got sore throat it's almost impossible i
[58:36] mean singers
[58:37] they don't like singing when they got
[58:38] horse throats right
[58:40] any singers like to sing with a bad
[58:41] throat no preachers don't like preaching
[58:43] with a bad
[58:44] but we'd have thought that's just a
[58:45] thought but he said satan said that to
[58:48] me
[58:51] you know what he said to satan you're a
[58:53] liar
[58:58] and he said i could hardly whisper when
[58:59] i came to the door
[59:01] but i walked in anyhow because god is
[59:04] going to do something here tonight
[59:07] maybe save some soul or heal somebody
[59:10] and
[59:10] my duty is to stand here whether i can
[59:13] whisper or grunt
[59:14] god will do something anyhow because he
[59:16] said he would do
[59:18] it's our duty to take our stand it's
[59:20] god's duty to back us up
[59:23] [Music]
[59:24] but first you got to realize that's a
[59:25] devil talking to you
[59:27] and say devil you're a liar
[59:36] i wonder how many people thinks is just
[59:38] thoughts well if i feel like i need to
[59:40] stay home from church tonight you know i
[59:43] could be a devil i'm pretty sure it
[59:45] ain't god
[59:50] amen well i just think in that way
[59:53] brother no
[59:54] something's influencing thoughts we
[1:00:00] better move on
[1:00:07] now you know god had told the children
[1:00:08] of israel
[1:00:10] down in egypt he said i give you the
[1:00:13] land
[1:00:14] but he didn't say i'm gonna go and sweep
[1:00:15] it all out garnish the houses and we'll
[1:00:17] hang up the curtains
[1:00:19] just everything you all just move in no
[1:00:21] no they had to fight
[1:00:23] for every inch of ground they took
[1:00:26] he said fighting taking possession
[1:00:28] everywhere the soles of your feet
[1:00:30] land that is possession footsteps of
[1:00:32] possession
[1:00:33] he said the same thing today divine
[1:00:35] healing belongs to us the holy spirit
[1:00:36] belongs to us
[1:00:37] it's our property but you'll fight for
[1:00:39] every inch of it amen
[1:00:41] brother it says footsteps is possession
[1:00:44] keep fighting
[1:00:45] but the devil will come and try to put a
[1:00:47] thought
[1:00:48] it says the days of miracles are passed
[1:00:51] you say
[1:00:52] you're a liar you want to know how you
[1:00:55] talk to the devil don't debate him
[1:00:57] don't try to just you know you talk
[1:01:00] you're a liar
[1:01:01] it's all you got to say you're a liar
[1:01:06] he's because god said he's the same
[1:01:08] yesterday today and forever and if he
[1:01:10] told me i could have it
[1:01:11] it's mine hallelujah
[1:01:16] we know this know this quote brother
[1:01:18] danny used it here some time ago at one
[1:01:20] of our meetings
[1:01:22] brother brandon walking down the street
[1:01:23] going down the street
[1:01:25] turned on the radio and the broadcast
[1:01:28] wanted to talk about creation
[1:01:30] had come from just some ashes blowing
[1:01:32] together some phosphate
[1:01:33] a few chemicals and warm sunshine
[1:01:35] created the german life
[1:01:37] and brought out life he said how
[1:01:38] ridiculous
[1:01:40] he says you know when the sunshine will
[1:01:42] kill it lay it out there to just kill it
[1:01:44] out there in the sun there's no such a
[1:01:46] thing but satan was trying to punch at
[1:01:48] me
[1:01:49] and after i'd taken my little rebecca to
[1:01:51] school this morning on the road back i
[1:01:53] started to turn the radio on again
[1:01:55] and i thought i'd get back into that
[1:01:57] stuff again so i just turned it but i
[1:01:59] thought no
[1:01:59] i just turned it back off and as i was
[1:02:03] going up the street satan said to me he
[1:02:05] said do you know
[1:02:06] that this man you call jesus was just a
[1:02:08] man like one day in his day
[1:02:10] like billy graham or robert just a man
[1:02:13] began to let me know lead a few people
[1:02:15] gather around him and they begin to cry
[1:02:17] out he's a great man it became greater
[1:02:19] and then he became a god to them and now
[1:02:21] scattered all
[1:02:22] over the world and that's all there is
[1:02:24] to him
[1:02:26] what from something that he had listened
[1:02:28] to and the devil found a little entrance
[1:02:31] and it began to work in his thoughts
[1:02:35] hello somebody he'd do it to a prophet
[1:02:37] he did it to jesus
[1:02:43] you know i i i i don't know
[1:02:46] if you would if you would see it back
[1:02:48] there when jesus when he went up to the
[1:02:49] mountain to be tempted
[1:02:52] and he took himself he took him up to
[1:02:53] the high place into the temple
[1:02:56] told him if you'd have looked up there i
[1:02:57] don't think you'd have saw the devil in
[1:02:59] jesus
[1:03:00] you saw jesus but the devil was speaking
[1:03:04] to him
[1:03:05] in his mind now jesus and his being
[1:03:08] been in the realms that he could be in
[1:03:10] no doubt he could have saw him standing
[1:03:12] there
[1:03:14] you get what i'm saying if you could see
[1:03:16] that you can probably scare you to death
[1:03:18] how many spirits come by you and talk to
[1:03:20] you
[1:03:22] i mean think about it come by and
[1:03:25] haunt at you and and put these weird
[1:03:27] feelings over you and things that
[1:03:29] worry little it's spirits
[1:03:33] thoughts are influenced by spirits
[1:03:36] and they find avenues something you
[1:03:38] listen to something that you watch
[1:03:39] something that
[1:03:40] was talked about it tries to come in and
[1:03:43] it tries to bring an avenue
[1:03:45] to get down in there into that heart
[1:03:48] because if it knows it can get to the
[1:03:50] heart it's no longer a thought it's what
[1:03:52] you believe
[1:03:56] amen and he said i thought devil how a
[1:03:59] liar you are
[1:04:02] and i turned his house crossing graham
[1:04:04] street i said satan
[1:04:05] you're talking to my conscience but i'd
[1:04:07] like to ask you a few things things
[1:04:10] who was it that the hebrew prophet spoke
[1:04:12] that would come
[1:04:13] who was the anointed messiah what was
[1:04:15] upon these men who foresaw him
[1:04:17] and told his life thousands of years
[1:04:18] before he got here who wasn't foretold
[1:04:21] it just took a letter and when he called
[1:04:23] me said he was number with the
[1:04:24] transgressors and he was
[1:04:26] he was wounded for our transgressions
[1:04:28] and he was he made his grave with a rich
[1:04:30] and on rise on the third day and he did
[1:04:33] and then he promised the holy ghost
[1:04:35] and he gave it whose words was that that
[1:04:37] was written in the bible and every word
[1:04:40] is true
[1:04:41] and when i began to speak the word of
[1:04:42] god he left
[1:04:46] hallelujah just give him the word
[1:04:50] this is exactly what jesus did he didn't
[1:04:53] try to give him his
[1:04:54] thinking and his thoughts and all what
[1:04:55] he could come up with and how to argue
[1:04:57] the devil
[1:04:58] he could not argue the devil he could
[1:05:00] take him back to the word
[1:05:02] because the word that thought is higher
[1:05:05] than your thoughts
[1:05:07] oh hallelujah he can't stand the word
[1:05:13] but he's coming to try to bring you down
[1:05:17] to try to bring you down into defeat
[1:05:22] this is what even goliath would do
[1:05:26] he tried to get into the imaginations of
[1:05:28] the
[1:05:29] the children of israel and he became
[1:05:32] even greater than what he really was
[1:05:35] in their minds just as it just you know
[1:05:39] it even happened you know when
[1:05:40] caleb and joshua went into the promised
[1:05:42] land
[1:05:44] and and they come back and they said
[1:05:46] they said they everyone everybody over
[1:05:47] there is giants and
[1:05:48] and we're grasshoppers in their sight
[1:05:50] who told them that
[1:05:53] i i don't know but i have a hard time
[1:05:56] believing
[1:05:57] that one of those giants walked up to
[1:05:58] that one those one of those ten spies
[1:06:00] and
[1:06:01] tapped him on the shoulder and said hey
[1:06:03] i'm bigger than you are
[1:06:04] matter of fact you know what you look to
[1:06:06] me you look like a grasshopper
[1:06:09] no that wasn't the way it was it was in
[1:06:11] their minds
[1:06:13] it was a thought that they they began to
[1:06:15] think i bet i look like a grasshopper
[1:06:18] that dude's so big that's impossible and
[1:06:21] it became bigger than what it really was
[1:06:25] because in god's thinking it wasn't big
[1:06:28] it wasn't an impossibility well i mean
[1:06:31] and man's thinking the walls looked too
[1:06:33] great
[1:06:35] looked impossible it was no way we're
[1:06:37] gonna and god's thinking it's like what
[1:06:38] are you waiting on
[1:06:40] it's yours don't take the land
[1:06:43] this is god's thinking he's saying it's
[1:06:45] yours healing is yours
[1:06:47] deliverance what are you waiting on
[1:06:50] it's yours go take it amen it ain't
[1:06:54] oh it's so big it's so great cancer is
[1:06:57] so terrible
[1:06:58] that's our first thoughts what's given
[1:07:01] you that thought
[1:07:03] the devil goliath
[1:07:06] just he would sit there and he'd pound
[1:07:08] his chest and he would
[1:07:09] throw out his spear and look how big my
[1:07:11] spirit is boys
[1:07:14] they'd go in their tents at night and
[1:07:16] they would dream about it and in their
[1:07:17] dreams it would get bigger and bigger
[1:07:19] and taller and taller and greater and
[1:07:20] greater
[1:07:21] and for 40 days and 40 nights he stood
[1:07:23] there
[1:07:25] but there came a different set of ears
[1:07:26] into the camp
[1:07:28] he looked at that and he cast down
[1:07:30] imaginations
[1:07:32] he said my god gave me that land i don't
[1:07:34] have to bow down to that goliath and his
[1:07:36] threats
[1:07:37] how long has he been here 40 nights are
[1:07:39] you kidding me
[1:07:40] give me i'll go kill him
[1:07:44] david you're trying to make yourself
[1:07:45] into somebody you're trying to be
[1:07:47] somebody you ain't called to be you
[1:07:49] ought to go back and
[1:07:50] what do you mean i am a son of abraham
[1:07:54] i'm a god called man i'm a son of
[1:07:57] abraham
[1:07:57] and i have a right to this land he don't
[1:08:00] have a right
[1:08:00] i'll go kill him
[1:08:10] i'll trust god to back me up that's
[1:08:13] what david did
[1:08:17] he come to the place he knew where he
[1:08:19] was at
[1:08:21] and if ever david's sitting here tonight
[1:08:24] we realize you're positionally
[1:08:26] placed in christ god has confirmed it by
[1:08:29] the holy ghost

[1:09:22] anymore
[1:09:23] but do you know not only that he had had
[1:09:26] cataracts in his eyes

[1:09:54] goliath of cancer made his challenge but
[1:09:57] he lost his head
[1:10:00] and when he lost his head then
[1:10:01] philistines took for the woods
[1:10:04] hallelujah and david said come on boys
[1:10:07] let's go get him
[1:10:09] amen we got some david's in the house
[1:10:11] tonight and said i'm tired of the devil
[1:10:13] coming in my mind
[1:10:14] and beat me up time after time after
[1:10:16] time i'm casting down my imagination
[1:10:19] i'm standing on the word of god and i'm
[1:10:21] holding the word of god
[1:10:23] it's truth it's gay it's amen it'll
[1:10:25] never fail
[1:10:35] he said cancer that's seeking you up
[1:10:37] those tumors that's hanging on them
[1:10:38] cataracts on your eyes that crippled arm
[1:10:40] everything looks at it and everyone
[1:10:42] looks at it and says it can't be done
[1:10:44] the devil will say you might as well
[1:10:47] quit believing
[1:10:49] how many you ever heard that thought
[1:10:53] oh guess what it wasn't you it was the
[1:10:56] devil
[1:11:00] you might as well quit believing you
[1:11:02] might as well settle down
[1:11:05] because you can't no more get well your
[1:11:08] doctor said so
[1:11:09] all the rest of them said so you can't
[1:11:11] get there but the same
[1:11:12] christ that stopped you from your
[1:11:15] drinking you're smoking you're lying
[1:11:16] you're stealing savior from a life of
[1:11:18] drunkenness and sin
[1:11:19] and the devil's grave if god can do that
[1:11:22] for you the same one can save you from
[1:11:23] your tb
[1:11:24] from your cancer he's a goliath don't
[1:11:27] take his boat stand in the name of jesus
[1:11:29] and challenge him to a showdown
[1:11:31] and he will fall oh hallelujah
[1:11:35] listen brother listen he backed him up
[1:11:37] on a sore throat
[1:11:40] cancer is nothing but a toothache
[1:11:43] spirits that comes and haunts you it's
[1:11:45] nothing to god
[1:11:48] it gets big in our own imagination but
[1:11:49] there's nothing to god
[1:11:52] it all depends on where you're looking
[1:11:53] from
[1:11:56] and how you're looking at something
[1:11:58] those 10 spies they were looking at
[1:11:59] walls like this
[1:12:01] wow you know you looked at something so
[1:12:04] high you felt like you're going to fall
[1:12:06] over backwards
[1:12:07] that's how they were they felt like
[1:12:08] they're just going to fall flat of their
[1:12:09] back it's so big
[1:12:11] it's so huge how am i going to get how
[1:12:13] are we going to
[1:12:14] caleb joshua it's impossible
[1:12:17] i think the way god looks at your
[1:12:18] problems he's got a different
[1:12:20] perspective
[1:12:27] he looks down on your adversary
[1:12:32] that mountain that you've made or you
[1:12:34] think's a mountain ain't nothing but a
[1:12:36] moe hill to god
[1:12:38] a little dust pile he can just kick it
[1:12:39] over with his feet or blow it down with
[1:12:41] his breath
[1:12:43] however he wants to do it and whatever
[1:12:45] you're dealing with
[1:12:46] is nothing to god
[1:12:50] he just needs you to believe
[1:13:01] he said when you come up for prayer
[1:13:03] listen this one
[1:13:05] you come up for prayer you need to get
[1:13:07] away from every superstition
[1:13:09] everything that i'll try to tell you the
[1:13:11] devil try to say to you
[1:13:12] will say to you well if i get called up
[1:13:15] on the platform
[1:13:16] i might get healed
[1:13:20] you see where the devil did it i might
[1:13:22] get healed
[1:13:25] get that devil away from you it doesn't
[1:13:28] matter whether you come up or not
[1:13:30] it's whether you come up with faith or
[1:13:32] not
[1:13:33] have faith in god amen when god comes on
[1:13:36] the scene
[1:13:37] all these other things don't even matter
[1:13:40] amen
[1:13:40] see you know he talks about i ain't got
[1:13:43] time to go into it but he talks about
[1:13:44] shamgar
[1:13:45] and how shamgar amen would come to those
[1:13:48] moments and his imaginations and
[1:13:49] he let his imagination go so wild until
[1:13:52] he let the enemy come year
[1:13:53] after year after year and the whole time
[1:13:56] he could have killed them
[1:13:57] on the first day the first time they
[1:14:01] came he could have took them out
[1:14:06] goliath's first sentence could have been
[1:14:08] a rock between his eyes
[1:14:11] just needed someone to believe
[1:14:16] amen he said that's he says what happens
[1:14:20] he said finally he got angry with the
[1:14:23] devil
[1:14:24] got tired of listening to him got tired
[1:14:26] of him putting it on him
[1:14:28] he said you know maybe you don't want to
[1:14:29] call it anger maybe you want to call it
[1:14:31] his righteous indignation god up
[1:14:33] he said that ought to happen to you
[1:14:35] that's on cots and stretchers
[1:14:37] and any condition this afternoon just
[1:14:39] get a little mad at the devil
[1:14:41] and say you old lying rascal you're a
[1:14:43] liar

[1:14:53] after service bound
[1:14:56] you don't have to leave bound amen
[1:14:58] christ has set you free
[1:15:00] you need to tell that devil he's a liar
[1:15:05] he tried to lie to you and tell you it's
[1:15:07] impossible for you to be saved
[1:15:09] it's not impossible he's trying to lie
[1:15:11] to you and tell you
[1:15:12] you've crossed the line no you haven't
[1:15:14] or you wouldn't even be here tonight
[1:15:16] he's trying to tell you that there's no
[1:15:18] mercy for you and there is
[1:15:20] he trying to tell you there's no grace
[1:15:21] for you and there is he's a liar
[1:15:24] amen that is the devil's thinking cast
[1:15:27] down the imagination
[1:15:28] and take the thoughts of god and say yes
[1:15:31] lord i accept it in the name of jesus
[1:15:44] don't matter what you go through
[1:15:48] what's what's going on let me go down to
[1:15:52] another
[1:15:57] find it here
[1:16:01] in the absolute pray in a prayer service
[1:16:06] he says good he said last night we had a
[1:16:08] great prayer service laying hands on the
[1:16:10] sick
[1:16:11] that's a good thing that's all it takes
[1:16:13] sometimes
[1:16:15] that's in 63 for those who want to know
[1:16:18] that's a good thing then there's some of
[1:16:22] some that there is something back there
[1:16:23] that say they didn't catch you got to
[1:16:25] get that person and find out what it is
[1:16:28] there's something hindering them
[1:16:30] something laying in the way one little
[1:16:32] shadow of vibrated away
[1:16:34] so now the little lady in there a few
[1:16:36] minutes ago she was so nervous so upset
[1:16:39] poor thing she couldn't even call to
[1:16:41] catch a breath
[1:16:42] he does a gasping sound just carrying on
[1:16:46] he said the thing you have to do here is
[1:16:48] just a little
[1:16:49] you got to catch that is catching her
[1:16:51] spirit
[1:16:52] then you're projecting to her the very
[1:16:54] thought
[1:16:56] and you change your thinking
[1:17:00] you change their thinking and when it
[1:17:03] does that
[1:17:04] you can center her back on christ from
[1:17:07] there
[1:17:08] she can go on this is what a service is
[1:17:11] for
[1:17:12] the words of god to come across the
[1:17:14] pulpit to change your thinking
[1:17:16] amen how many remembers a day your
[1:17:18] thought changed from never being saved
[1:17:20] till i am a son of god
[1:17:22] amen when your thoughts change from i
[1:17:23] can't get well till i'm healed
[1:17:28] amen it's catching your spirit amen
[1:17:31] something trying to block it there he
[1:17:33] said but it's the change of thinking and
[1:17:34] when it does that
[1:17:35] you can center him back on christ you've
[1:17:38] got to change your way of thinking she
[1:17:40] can't change it herself
[1:17:41] she's running in the world you got to
[1:17:43] pick that up now there's just something
[1:17:44] that
[1:17:45] he said don't try to study it don't do
[1:17:46] it just believe it and go home
[1:17:48] he said how could that little baby
[1:17:49] laying on that mother's arm been dead
[1:17:51] since nine o'clock that morning
[1:17:52] just to wait in the night where the
[1:17:54] where where was that little spirit
[1:17:56] you have to find it and bring it back
[1:17:58] and when you see it coming back you can
[1:18:00] rise in the name of the lord and call it
[1:18:02] and then it'll happen but till you do
[1:18:04] that you're just wasting your breath
[1:18:06] there's nothing mysterious about it
[1:18:07] it's finding god and getting yourself
[1:18:10] out of the way and let the holy spirit
[1:18:12] use you to whatever he wants to do
[1:18:15] it's only a gift it's getting your own
[1:18:17] ideas your own thinking
[1:18:19] and let christ become manifested let
[1:18:22] christ
[1:18:22] become amen move in your body hallelujah
[1:18:26] he said just as he told moses he'd give
[1:18:28] him the land
[1:18:29] he told joshua i'll give it to you but
[1:18:32] what happened
[1:18:32] their thinking had to turn towards the
[1:18:34] promise
[1:18:36] to where it wasn't just their thinking
[1:18:38] no more it became their belief
[1:18:41] and this is where caleb and joshua would
[1:18:42] come out and you could tell it wasn't
[1:18:44] what they thought no more
[1:18:45] it's what they believe caleb said we're
[1:18:47] more than able to take the land
[1:18:50] because it didn't matter what was in the
[1:18:51] way no more their thoughts
[1:18:54] have been centered on the promise
[1:18:58] that's what we have to do bring our
[1:19:01] thoughts back to the promise
[1:19:05] if your thinking is against the word of
[1:19:08] god
[1:19:11] and you don't have the seal of god
[1:19:15] you're in a dangerous position because
[1:19:18] that thinking will become belief
[1:19:21] but if there's a seal there that thought
[1:19:24] would come
[1:19:25] but that seal override that thought and
[1:19:28] cast it down
[1:19:30] you can't keep thoughts from coming you
[1:19:33] can't keep it they can't help it it's
[1:19:34] like they said birds flying over your
[1:19:36] head
[1:19:36] it just happens but you need to we need
[1:19:39] to
[1:19:39] be more cognizant and realize what's
[1:19:42] influencing that thought
[1:19:44] it's not just a thought
[1:19:47] there's a spirit behind it
[1:19:52] we want to be tuned in to that other
[1:19:54] realm
[1:19:55] to where that thinking becomes our
[1:19:57] thinking
[1:19:59] his thoughts are higher than my thoughts
[1:20:01] his ways are way past what i can come up
[1:20:03] with
[1:20:05] i wonder tonight
[1:20:09] if we could just look at it for a moment
[1:20:10] and say you know
[1:20:13] maybe i need to think about some things
[1:20:16] i've been dwelling on the wrong thing
[1:20:18] brother timothy
[1:20:22] i need to cast it aside
[1:20:26] i people can say things people can do
[1:20:31] things people can
[1:20:32] hurt your feelings people can hurt you
[1:20:34] in all kinds of ways
[1:20:37] and if you stay on that thought
[1:20:41] it'll take you down into bitterness and
[1:20:44] unbelief
[1:20:47] you'll get to a place if you stay on if
[1:20:49] somebody puts a real hurt on you and you
[1:20:51] stay on that long enough
[1:20:53] you'll get to a place that you'll
[1:20:54] believe nobody is good
[1:20:58] you'll believe nobody can help you
[1:21:01] negativity breeds negativity
[1:21:05] we want positive
[1:21:08] and what's positive it ain't just happy
[1:21:10] good luck
[1:21:11] good luck good luck thoughts that's not
[1:21:13] what i'm talking about positive
[1:21:14] is the word of god let that word
[1:21:19] be what you dwell on if there be any
[1:21:21] virtue if there be any praise
[1:21:23] think on these things think on these
[1:21:26] things
[1:21:27] think on the word of god you say well
[1:21:29] brother timothy i
[1:21:30] i'm trying to believe for the promise
[1:21:33] but
[1:21:34] i hadn't felt it i it doesn't matter
[1:21:40] don't put your thinking on your feelings
[1:21:43] put your thinking on the word
[1:21:45] the word promised it that's all that
[1:21:48] matters
[1:21:49] the word said it that's all that matters
[1:21:52] it's his word
[1:21:54] let's bow our heads
[1:22:07] i wonder if there be somebody here
[1:22:08] honest before god
[1:22:13] say i need my thinking changed
[1:22:18] i need my thoughts changed lord
[1:22:24] yes lord
[1:22:28] lord help me to realize what's
[1:22:29] influencing these thoughts
[1:22:35] help me to realize lord when something
[1:22:37] comes and i begin to dwell and stew
[1:22:39] and worry and fret
[1:22:43] it's a spirit cast it down
[1:22:49] yes lord
[1:22:52] hands lifted all over this building
[1:22:55] if you need to get right with god
[1:22:57] tonight tonight's the night to do it
[1:23:01] you don't have to stay in that condition
[1:23:04] you don't have to walk back home with
[1:23:06] that crutch
[1:23:08] you can leave it at the seat
[1:23:21] yes lord
[1:23:25] let our thoughts line up to your word
[1:23:26] lord
[1:23:28] your thinking is higher than our
[1:23:30] thinking
[1:23:32] your ways are higher than our ways
[1:23:36] yes lord
[1:23:39] father you've seen the hands that were
[1:23:42] lifted all over this building
[1:23:48] lord help us to turn our eyes on you
[1:23:50] completely
[1:23:52] lord to look full into your face father
[1:23:56] to
[1:23:57] your word lord
[1:24:01] god how much more sincere we need to be
[1:24:05] about the things of god
[1:24:10] as we see that time approaching lord
[1:24:13] lord we know we're very close
[1:24:17] we see judas taking the sob
[1:24:24] and you told him to go do what thou has
[1:24:26] to do
[1:24:27] quickly and we see him moving
[1:24:30] out the door how much longer do we have
[1:24:34] lord
[1:24:38] can't be very much longer
[1:24:42] father there must be a few more souls
[1:24:43] for you to grab a hold of
[1:24:50] oh jesus let your spirit god just move
[1:24:54] on every heart lord
[1:24:57] lord we sure don't want this world's
[1:24:58] thinking to become our beliefs
