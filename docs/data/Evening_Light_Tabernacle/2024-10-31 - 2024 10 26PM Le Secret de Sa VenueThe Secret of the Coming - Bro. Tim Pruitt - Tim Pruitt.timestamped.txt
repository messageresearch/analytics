[32:18] bless you turn with me to Malachi 4 and
[32:22] we'll read from verse
[32:25] five I have several scriptures I want to
[32:27] read
[32:29] before you're
[32:30] seated we're going to draw a text
[32:36] from Malachi 4:5 behold I send you
[32:40] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[32:42] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[32:44] and he shall turn the heart of the
[32:46] fathers to the children and the Heart of
[32:48] the children to their fathers lest I
[32:51] come and smite the Earth with a curse
[33:05] turn with me to Luke 17 verse
[33:10] 30 this is speaking of as a day in the
[33:13] days of
[33:14] lot the lot even thus shall it be in the
[33:18] day when the son of man is
[33:26] revealed all right and we'll go to 1
[33:28] Thessalonians
[33:37] 4:13
[33:40] sorry but I would not have you to be
[33:42] ignorant Brethren concerning them which
[33:44] are asleep that you sorrow not even as
[33:48] others which have no
[33:54] hope for if we believe that Jesus died
[33:58] and rose again even so them also which
[34:00] sleep in Jesus will God bring with
[34:08] him for this we say unto you by the word
[34:11] of the Lord that we which are alive and
[34:13] remain until the coming of the Lord
[34:15] shall not prevent them which are
[34:23] asleep am for the Lord himself shall
[34:26] descend from heaven with a sh and with
[34:28] the voice of the Archangel and with the
[34:30] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[34:32] shall rise
[34:39] first then we which are alive and remain
[34:42] shall be caught up together with him in
[34:44] the clouds to meet the Lord in the air
[34:46] and so shall we ever be with the
[34:55] Lord wherefore come one another with
[34:58] these
[35:01] words then Revelation 8 verse
[35:05] one and when he had opened the seventh
[35:07] seal there was silence in heaven about
[35:09] the space of an half an
[35:15] hour and then Revelation
[35:18] 101 and I saw another Mighty Angel come
[35:22] down from heaven clothed with a cloud
[35:23] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[35:25] face was as it were the Sun and his feet
[35:28] as pillars of
[35:36] fire amen and he had in his hand a
[35:39] little book open and he set his right
[35:41] foot upon the sea his left foot on the
[35:48] earth and he cried with a loud voice as
[35:50] when a lion roar and when he had cried
[35:53] seven Thunders uttered their voices
[36:00] and when the seven Thunders had uttered
[36:01] their voices I was about to write and I
[36:04] Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me
[36:06] seal up those things which the seven
[36:08] Thunders uttered and write them
[36:16] not amen and the angel which I saw stand
[36:20] upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted
[36:22] up his hand to heaven
[36:27] and swear by him that liveth forever and
[36:30] ever who created heaven and the things
[36:32] that therein are and the earth and the
[36:34] things that are therein and the Sea and
[36:37] the things which are therein that there
[36:40] should be time no
[36:49] longer but in the days of the voice of
[36:52] the seventh angel when he shall begin
[36:54] the sound the mystery of God should be
[36:56] finished as he had declared to his
[36:59] servants the
[37:06] prophets amen amen God bless you can
[37:08] take your
[37:11] seats brother Timothy ministered this
[37:14] morning it was a
[37:16] masterpiece on the casting down of
[37:21] imagination tonight we are not going to
[37:24] take an Evangelistic approach
[37:27] we're going to do some indepth teaching
[37:30] on the word of
[37:33] God and in doing so we're going to cast
[37:36] down
[37:38] imagination because much of things that
[37:41] are called
[37:44] Revelation is actually people's
[37:48] imagination and it has a tail of several
[37:51] kilometers
[37:54] long so you know we are going to cast
[37:57] down
[37:59] imagination we want our faith to be
[38:02] settled on the word of
[38:05] God and you may wonder why I read all of
[38:08] those scriptures
[38:10] tonight you might wonder well how do
[38:13] they
[38:13] connect what common factor do they all
[38:17] include his
[38:19] coming you see we must be ready in the
[38:23] time of his
[38:25] coming and it is clear that Jesus comes
[38:29] in the seventh Church
[38:32] age so we're going to speak tonight on
[38:35] the subject of the The Secret of his
[38:40] coming now brother Bram tells us in the
[38:42] Ephesian Church
[38:44] age said there's something that you
[38:46] ought to
[38:47] know the seven churches which were
[38:50] addressed by John are in
[38:54] Asia they are all Gentile churches
[38:57] he does not speak to the Church of
[38:59] Jerusalem which is mostly je
[39:04] Jewish with perhaps just a few Gentiles
[39:07] in
[39:08] it the reason is that God has turned
[39:11] from the Jews to the
[39:15] Gentiles now listen closely thus the
[39:19] whole of the church
[39:21] ages is God dealing with the
[39:24] Gentiles and calling out a gentile bride
[39:27] to
[39:29] himself so that makes the church
[39:32] ages and the fullness of the
[39:35] Gentiles the one and same
[39:38] thing so we're in the very end of the
[39:41] last Church
[39:43] AG there are no more Messengers to
[39:46] come there are no additions to the
[39:50] message once the seventh angel sounded
[39:53] his
[39:55] message the mystery concerning the bride
[39:58] is
[40:00] finished there is there is no one else
[40:03] needed to bring
[40:05] Clarity God said it the way he wanted
[40:09] it and it needs no one to embellish
[40:13] it and let us be sure there is no eighth
[40:19] age there are only seven horns on the
[40:24] lamb and each horn repres represents an
[40:29] age to make another
[40:32] age after the seventh age is to go
[40:36] outside of the
[40:38] Lamb it will remove you from
[40:41] Christ and the bright age is not another
[40:45] age remember this the whole of the
[40:49] church
[40:50] ages God dealing with the
[40:52] Gentiles calling out a gentile bride to
[40:55] himself
[40:57] makes the church ages and the fullness
[40:59] of the Gentiles one and the same
[41:03] thing so when the Gentile dispensation
[41:06] is
[41:08] over the church ages are
[41:11] over when God finishes the church
[41:14] Jesus there will be no more Gentiles
[41:18] saved and so once the seven seven Church
[41:22] ages are over there are no other ages
[41:28] so the bride age is not another
[41:31] age there are not Seven Ages and then a
[41:34] bride
[41:35] Age The Bride ages when the church who
[41:39] is the Bride Comes to maturity comes to
[41:44] age it is bride
[41:46] time it is the time of the elect
[41:49] lady she is what his coming is
[41:53] about she must be mature and ready to
[41:56] meet him
[41:58] now as a church we were a immature child
[42:02] in Luther's
[42:04] day we were like a pre-teen in
[42:07] Wesley teenager
[42:10] atza now by the message of the
[42:13] hour the bride must be
[42:16] mature and ready to meet
[42:20] him now so so this is not the eighth
[42:25] day we are present in the sixth
[42:29] day in the seventh age but the sixth day
[42:35] so we are presently in the sixth
[42:38] day a day with the Lord is as a thousand
[42:41] years so there was about 2,000 years
[42:44] from Adam to the
[42:47] flood 2,000 years from the flood to the
[42:51] Cross 2,000 years from the cross to the
[42:53] seven Church ages to the rapture
[42:58] so we are in the sixth
[43:01] day the day of man and it's about to
[43:05] end and it will end with the battle of
[43:09] Armageddon then will come the day of the
[43:11] Lord the Millennium the seventh day the
[43:15] day of rest and and then only after the
[43:19] white Throne
[43:21] judgment will there come the Eternal
[43:23] Church age where he makes an where he
[43:27] makes a new heavens and a new
[43:31] Earth that's the Eternal Church age that
[43:34] ised in after the
[43:39] Millennium well brother Brandon spoke of
[43:42] the Eternal Church age that comes after
[43:44] the
[43:47] seals that's right and the seventh
[43:50] seal in the
[43:52] Millennium and after the
[43:55] Millennium comes the eternal
[43:57] age or the Eighth
[43:59] Day so we are ending the day of
[44:03] man where we are to be caught away in a
[44:06] Rapture and after three and a half years
[44:09] wedding supper come back for the seventh
[44:13] day the millennial
[44:15] R you said well now brother Tim I'm
[44:18] already in the
[44:20] E I'm already in eternity I'm an eternal
[44:24] creature well pinch yourself
[44:27] you'll find out you're
[44:29] not you're not in the Sweet By and
[44:32] By you're right here in the dirty here
[44:34] and
[44:36] now you see but maybe you
[44:39] insist but in my soul I've already been
[44:43] caught up into
[44:44] eternity but that's not unique to our
[44:48] age Paul said every Born Again
[44:52] believer is sitting with Christ in
[44:56] Heavenly places
[44:58] in Christ
[44:59] Jesus now when we're looking at this
[45:03] we're going to we're going to examine
[45:05] Revelation
[45:07] 3 and Revelation 4 and we're going to
[45:11] come to an understanding brother Bram
[45:14] never spiritualizes Revelation
[45:18] 4 so we're going to start with
[45:20] Revelation
[45:21] 3 continue to Revelation
[45:25] 4 so in verse 21
[45:28] to him that
[45:29] overcometh that's me say you will I gr
[45:33] to sit with me in my
[45:35] throne even as I also
[45:38] overcame and have sat down with my
[45:41] father in his
[45:42] throne he that has an he let him hear
[45:44] what the
[45:46] spirit amen amen now concerning these
[45:50] Overcomers brother Brom says we find the
[45:53] True Vine true Spirit true church people
[45:58] exalted to the very Throne of
[46:00] God with the highest compliment ever
[46:04] paid humble steadfast spiritual
[46:08] group so the false Vine gets a bitter
[46:14] denunciation but the True Vine is
[46:17] exalted to the very Throne of
[46:20] God with the highest compliment
[46:23] ever ever paid the humble stepf
[46:28] group so the lean age
[46:32] ends with the people who are rewarded as
[46:37] overc to sit with him on his
[46:40] throne they are robed in white
[46:43] rment they have the true
[46:46] riches they have gold tried in the
[46:49] fire they are not blind
[46:53] Le theide of the
[46:55] word Ed their
[46:58] eyes you see so they see clearly what
[47:01] God is
[47:03] doing and the age ends with a
[47:07] Rapture the age ends with the bride
[47:10] ascending to the
[47:13] throne so look at the very next verse
[47:17] which is revelation
[47:18] 41 and after this I looked and behold
[47:22] the door was open in heaven and the
[47:25] first verse voice that I heard
[47:27] as it were of a trumpet talk
[47:29] me said come up
[47:32] hi and I will show you things that which
[47:35] must be
[47:37] here now brother Bram teaches us and
[47:40] this is a quote what John
[47:44] represented the entire church was taken
[47:47] up I told you one person here in the
[47:51] vision can represent the entire body of
[47:55] Christ
[47:57] amen amen so John is caught up at the
[48:02] end of the church ages into the
[48:06] heavens amen a type of the
[48:09] Rapture one person representing the
[48:12] intire
[48:13] body even all the resurrected Saints
[48:17] down Through the Ages go in a Rapture
[48:21] together to meet the Lord in the
[48:24] air amen amen he goes on and tells us
[48:28] joh being taken up immediately after the
[48:31] church
[48:32] age it was a type of the Rapture
[48:36] Church immediately after the church age
[48:38] is
[48:39] over Le and church age then comes the
[48:44] Rapture the church goes up like John did
[48:48] into the presence of God say oh my that
[48:53] just winds my soul around hold up
[48:57] at the Rapture of the
[48:59] church so brother Bram taught us that
[49:02] the bride is
[49:04] raptured in the fourth chapter of
[49:08] Revelation and does not return into the
[49:11] 19th Chapter of
[49:14] Revelation where we are seeing coming
[49:18] back with him on white hores for the
[49:22] battle of
[49:23] Armageddon so Revelation
[49:25] 41 is the physical
[49:29] Rapture and the going away of the bride
[49:32] and Revelation
[49:34] 19 is the physical Return of the church
[49:39] with the groom for the Battle of
[49:42] armagedon so everything between
[49:46] Revelation and Revelation 19 that
[49:50] pertains to the
[49:52] bride the Seven Seals Revelation 10 the
[49:56] seventh angel the seven Thunders
[50:00] Revelation
[50:01] 18 which is the call come out of her my
[50:04] people so that you're not partakers of
[50:07] that all of this must happen in the
[50:11] seven Church
[50:13] ages in chapters 1 through
[50:16] three particularly in in the seventh
[50:19] Church
[50:20] age amen where God brings forth a mature
[50:24] bride
[50:26] amen so everything from 4 to 19 that
[50:32] pertains to the bride must happen in the
[50:35] seven Church
[50:37] ages the call come out of her my people
[50:41] the mighty angel coming down the
[50:43] sounding of the seven
[50:45] Thunders the opening of The Seven SE all
[50:49] of these things must happen in the
[50:52] seventh Church age because it's the age
[50:57] the mature elect
[51:00] lady now brother tells us in the Rapture
[51:03] message he said Enoch was the seventh
[51:07] from
[51:08] Adam which is a type of the church
[51:11] ages now all the rest of the six men
[51:14] before him
[51:15] died but Enoch was
[51:18] translated Enoch was raptured the
[51:21] seventh showing it is the seventh Church
[51:24] age that takes the
[51:28] now then he says now there's no doubt we
[51:31] are in the seventh Church
[51:35] age we all know
[51:38] it well apparently some
[51:40] don't they say well we've already left
[51:44] the we're already in another age we're
[51:47] somewhere else beside this
[51:49] age now he goes on to say now it's the
[51:54] seventh Church age that makes the
[51:57] Rapture all the other six died en was
[52:01] translated he was not found CU God took
[52:04] him but Enoch was raptured it was the
[52:08] type of all the rest of them
[52:10] dying the en bride the rapturing without
[52:15] death be called out of the seventh
[52:18] Church
[52:19] age we are now bearing record of that
[52:24] age so we are here in the L last
[52:27] AG it is the age of his
[52:30] coming there are no more
[52:33] Messengers amen no more Messengers from
[52:35] Jesus
[52:37] anyway to his bride it's all inclusive
[52:41] in the seventh Angels
[52:45] message and do you know we can no longer
[52:48] put the come of the Lord in future tense
[52:52] only because there is a phase of his
[52:55] coming that
[52:57] future that's a literal physical coming
[53:00] of the
[53:01] Lord and on that day and hour no one
[53:05] knows so it behooves us to be
[53:08] steadfast and ready for it for you know
[53:11] not what
[53:12] hour that the Lord might come but
[53:16] brother Bram tells us he says in three
[53:18] kinds of
[53:20] Believers that's the reason I do believe
[53:23] that when a bride is called out elect
[53:26] and set in The Book of Life there come a
[53:29] sound from Heaven that will take such a
[53:32] baptism of the Holy Spirit into that
[53:35] bride that take her from the
[53:38] earth Grace God promised I don't care
[53:42] how many science how many
[53:46] astronauts and everything else oh how
[53:49] many million miles they can
[53:51] see there is a
[53:53] Heaven There is a literal Jesus
[53:58] that come in a body
[54:00] form receive his church and his and no
[54:05] matter how old the
[54:07] story it's still the
[54:09] truth God said so that's what Believers
[54:14] believe amen amen amen and so we're
[54:17] looking for the physical Corporal
[54:22] coming
[54:25] weet that's what Believers believe am
[54:29] amen amen but yet Christ is
[54:32] here he's here in a spiritual
[54:35] form but he's coming in a physical
[54:38] form amen he said I am he that was dead
[54:43] and I am alive
[54:45] forever and I have the keys of death and
[54:48] of hell I declare tonight he is a
[54:52] present
[54:54] God amen amen and we not say because he
[54:57] is present and that he is with us that
[55:01] he will not save us that he will not
[55:03] redeem that he will not heal he will not
[55:07] deliver he will not fill with the Holy
[55:09] Ghost but that's why he's
[55:12] here Amen to provide for
[55:15] you that you would have to be your
[55:20] redemer hallelujah amen he's here to
[55:22] fill our being with his
[55:25] life finish
[55:28] Redemption but you know men you know are
[55:32] looking for the wrong thing to identify
[55:35] his
[55:36] presence many will look for a
[55:39] man come walking down the street with
[55:42] nail stars in a white
[55:45] robe any impersonator can do
[55:48] that we will not see the literal
[55:52] Corporal physical body of
[55:55] Christ till the meeting in the
[55:58] air for he must remain on the throne of
[56:03] Mercy until the last predestinated
[56:09] SE am let me just tell you no preacher
[56:14] can close the door
[56:16] of nobody can take away the day of
[56:20] Grace God
[56:23] opens and when God sh no
[56:29] man
[56:31] amen and he will remain on the seed of
[56:36] Mercy until the last predestinated
[56:42] seed hallelujah amen we're not going to
[56:45] leave a hoof
[56:47] behind amen praise the
[56:50] Lord now brother Ram tells us that 80%
[56:55] of Jesus
[56:57] Ministry of of his
[56:59] talk was on his second
[57:03] coming not what was then his sacrifice
[57:05] and going
[57:07] away but the second coming and he gave
[57:10] the people
[57:12] warning and he says if Jesus talks so
[57:15] much 80% of his of his time on the
[57:19] second
[57:21] coming then it behooves us to listen to
[57:24] see what he would say
[57:28] place he said you'll hear Nations Rising
[57:31] against Nation kingdoms against Kingdom
[57:35] you'll hear the all these things the
[57:37] temp will be tored
[57:38] down not one stone left on the other
[57:42] that's not the end yet and right down at
[57:45] the end but he said when you see the
[57:48] victory put for this
[57:50] bud and all the other trees you see a
[57:54] restoration time then you know summer is
[57:58] not likewise when you see this know that
[58:02] it's now at the door barely I say this
[58:06] generation shall not pass until all be
[58:10] fulfilled now the United Nations
[58:13] recognize Israel as a
[58:16] nation and it declared its independence
[58:19] in
[58:21] 1948 but the moment that God recognized
[58:26] Israel as a
[58:28] nation will be after the bride is
[58:31] raptured and the two prophets appear
[58:35] on and that generation will not pass
[58:39] away until all is
[58:42] fulfilled amen now we read Malachi
[58:46] 4 without this Prophet there would be no
[58:51] people ready for his
[58:53] coming it took a message to call the
[58:56] right
[58:57] out and to turn our hearts back
[59:01] to and from the confusion
[59:04] caused 40,000 different
[59:08] denominations each with their own
[59:11] interpretation amen amen so without
[59:14] Malachi 4 there can't be a
[59:17] Rapture without Malachi
[59:20] 4 without a time of
[59:22] restoration there cannot be a bride
[59:28] amen now the Bible says as the Lord
[59:32] descends there will be three phases to
[59:35] his
[59:36] coming there will a shout the voice of
[59:39] the arang and the Trump of
[59:42] God amen amen the shout is a
[59:46] message you see it's to gather the
[59:49] elect the
[59:52] denominations back to the word
[59:54] again remember abrah God could not bless
[59:58] Abraham with the promised son until he
[1:00:02] was in the promised
[1:00:04] land Israel has to be in their
[1:00:07] promise in order to receive their
[1:00:11] Messiah and the bride of Christ must be
[1:00:14] in her
[1:00:15] promise the word of God in order to
[1:00:19] receive the return of
[1:00:21] Christ and Jesus will only come to those
[1:00:25] who are in the promised
[1:00:29] land so the shout was a mighty
[1:00:33] message it wasn't just noise it wasn't
[1:00:36] just somebody screaming it was a
[1:00:40] message and it was a call Gathering the
[1:00:44] elect back to the word again to prepare
[1:00:48] a people for the meeting in the
[1:00:52] air to
[1:00:54] shout that was Christ
[1:00:56] the logos in word
[1:00:59] form coming to a
[1:01:01] prophet amen he had to return in word
[1:01:06] form in order for them to be a bride
[1:01:09] prepared for his
[1:01:11] coming it was a dire necessity for the
[1:01:14] word to be
[1:01:18] restored and for the End Time Mystery of
[1:01:21] the Seven Seals to be revealed
[1:01:26] now the theme of brother Bron's
[1:01:28] Ministry I know many of us would think
[1:01:30] well it's Hebrews 13
[1:01:33] and8 and that's true it was a
[1:01:35] threat in every
[1:01:38] message the theme of his entire
[1:01:41] Ministry was on the coming of the
[1:01:44] Lord the events surrounding the end
[1:01:49] time now we are in the cycle of his
[1:01:53] coming and it started with God sending a
[1:01:58] prophet like Elijah to prepare the way
[1:02:03] people for the coming of the
[1:02:05] Lord and exactly as his first coming
[1:02:07] started with
[1:02:09] John Prophet a
[1:02:12] forerunner so God started his second
[1:02:15] coming by sending Elijah to be a
[1:02:20] forerunner Amen to bring us back to the
[1:02:24] promised land of the world
[1:02:27] in order that we might receive the
[1:02:31] Messiah amen so the m so his coming
[1:02:35] begins with a
[1:02:37] shout so this is the day of his coming
[1:02:42] and his coming is already in
[1:02:47] process amen now it's like my daughter
[1:02:50] Bethany Beth when she was 5 years
[1:02:53] old I went to her bed that morning her
[1:02:58] birthday on her fth
[1:03:00] birthday and I woke her up and I said
[1:03:04] Bethy Beth and she opened her big brown
[1:03:07] eyes and looked at me and smiled and I
[1:03:10] said Bethany today is your
[1:03:13] birthday and she she looked at me she
[1:03:17] said no Daddy today is not my
[1:03:20] birthday I said oh yes it is 5 years ago
[1:03:24] today
[1:03:26] I held you for the first time my heart
[1:03:29] you were such a cute little
[1:03:31] baby she said no Daddy this is not my
[1:03:36] birthday I said yes it is she said well
[1:03:39] then where's the
[1:03:42] cake where's all the guest where's all
[1:03:46] the you see amen we look around so
[1:03:49] where's the dead in
[1:03:50] Christ where's the where's the meeting
[1:03:53] in the
[1:03:54] air where's all that is
[1:03:56] promise but today is the day of coming
[1:04:01] you are in the age of the coming of the
[1:04:04] Lord amen amen so we look around and we
[1:04:09] we say the the Rapture is an ongoing
[1:04:13] event so like some say well where are
[1:04:16] the dead in Christ where's the corpal
[1:04:18] body of the Lord where meting in the air
[1:04:22] now listen the change happens
[1:04:25] in a moment and a
[1:04:28] twinkling but not the
[1:04:30] Rapture it is a process and it happens
[1:04:34] in three
[1:04:37] phases amen amen what good would it do
[1:04:40] for the Lord to
[1:04:41] come and nobody ready for his
[1:04:44] coming amen so the coming of the Lord is
[1:04:49] a
[1:04:51] mystery as he says in 1 Corinthians 151
[1:04:57] behold I show you a
[1:05:00] mystery we shall not all sleep but we
[1:05:03] shall all be changed in a moment in the
[1:05:07] twinkling of an eye at the last
[1:05:10] Trump for the trumpet shall sound and
[1:05:13] the dead shall
[1:05:15] riseup we shall be changed this corrupt
[1:05:20] must put on
[1:05:21] incorruption and this Mortal must put on
[1:05:24] immortality
[1:05:26] so
[1:05:27] now so here we are now in the very hour
[1:05:31] of his coming but he coming it's a
[1:05:36] mystery and the Bible speaks it will be
[1:05:39] as it was in the days of
[1:05:43] lot and it didn't say the son of man
[1:05:46] would
[1:05:47] come but that he would be
[1:05:52] revealed so he comes now at the son Son
[1:05:55] of Man reveals
[1:05:58] himself as the word to prepare a people
[1:06:03] for the coming of the
[1:06:05] Lord so here we are we're in a day when
[1:06:09] man can destroy the world 30 times
[1:06:14] over the atomic or the nuclear fire is
[1:06:18] about to
[1:06:20] fall but it's also in this day that the
[1:06:24] son of man
[1:06:26] the word is
[1:06:28] revealed amen amen so notice now we we
[1:06:32] know who the son of man is is Christ the
[1:06:36] word and before we meet Jesus in the
[1:06:40] air the son of man as the word is
[1:06:45] revealed before the physical coming
[1:06:48] there's a
[1:06:51] revelation so as it was in the days of s
[1:06:55] God came down to Abraham and revealed
[1:06:57] himself in human
[1:06:59] flesh while two angels went down to
[1:07:02] Sodom call out lot there was one who
[1:07:06] stayed with
[1:07:07] Abraham and he brought to Abraham the
[1:07:09] sign of the
[1:07:11] Messiah Sarah's heart in
[1:07:13] the he brought her a message telling her
[1:07:17] of the coming of the promised
[1:07:20] son and the change of their
[1:07:23] body so the sign that he is
[1:07:27] here as the word discerns the thoughts
[1:07:30] and intents of the
[1:07:32] heart we know it was the
[1:07:35] word because only the word can
[1:07:39] accurately discern the thoughts and
[1:07:41] intent of the
[1:07:43] heart
[1:07:48] never you with me amen amen it wasn't a
[1:07:51] head in a
[1:07:52] mess it discerned the thoughts
[1:07:55] of heart what was that
[1:07:58] identifying the word is
[1:08:02] present amen it has come to a
[1:08:06] prophet because that's God's way of
[1:08:09] revealing
[1:08:10] himself never to a
[1:08:12] theologian but he will reveal himself to
[1:08:15] his servants the
[1:08:17] prophet amen
[1:08:20] amen maybe like Sarah sah she talk me so
[1:08:25] do we
[1:08:26] Ponder could this be
[1:08:28] true here we are 2,000 year old
[1:08:31] bride and we're going to bring forth
[1:08:33] Christ back to the Earth again the
[1:08:36] promised son me this old woman yeah you
[1:08:41] going to conceive strength because there
[1:08:43] is a message to
[1:08:45] you Angel give you the
[1:08:48] faith for your
[1:08:51] change amen hallelujah amen you wonder
[1:08:56] why can't people see the
[1:08:59] Promise well Le is prophesied to be
[1:09:03] blind amen how are they blind how is
[1:09:06] Israel blind the Messiah Jesus did not
[1:09:10] come in the manner they
[1:09:13] were they were looking for a king with
[1:09:16] the reign of the son of
[1:09:19] David but before he could come as king
[1:09:22] he had to first come as the Lamb of God
[1:09:27] so how did he come he came in a
[1:09:30] Manger he came in a way they were not
[1:09:35] expecting see even the disciples were
[1:09:38] looking for the wrong
[1:09:40] coming they too were looking for the
[1:09:42] millennial
[1:09:44] Kingdom where Christ will reign as son
[1:09:46] of
[1:09:47] David so we find them in Acts 1 and
[1:09:50] verse
[1:09:52] 6 they have this they have this question
[1:09:57] and when they were come together they
[1:09:59] asked of him saying Lord will at this
[1:10:04] time will thou restore again the kingdom
[1:10:07] to
[1:10:08] Israel so notice they have a question
[1:10:12] you know we're expecting the kingdom to
[1:10:15] be
[1:10:16] restored we're expecting the son of
[1:10:18] David
[1:10:19] to and will you do that
[1:10:22] now and Jesus said it is not for you to
[1:10:26] know times of the Season which the
[1:10:29] father has put in his
[1:10:31] own that's not for you to know it's a
[1:10:35] secret but you shall receive
[1:10:38] power after the Holy
[1:10:41] Ghost upon you so there is a coming that
[1:10:45] you must be a part
[1:10:47] of I'm coming
[1:10:49] again not as son of David but I'm coming
[1:10:54] in the form of the holy
[1:10:56] spirit amen to fill you and to give you
[1:11:00] power and you shall be
[1:11:02] Witnesses in
[1:11:05] Jerusalem Samar the
[1:11:08] part so the disciples were looking for
[1:11:12] the wrong
[1:11:13] coming he was not coming in a Corporal
[1:11:17] body sit on the throne of
[1:11:19] David instead he was coming to sit on
[1:11:22] the throne of their heart
[1:11:24] heart he had to be enthroned
[1:11:27] here before he would take you to the
[1:11:29] throne
[1:11:31] there but did he return He said I'll not
[1:11:34] leave you
[1:11:35] comfor I will come to you was that him
[1:11:40] did he come Acts 2 verse one and when
[1:11:44] the day of Pentecost
[1:11:46] was they were all with one Accord in one
[1:11:50] and suddenly there came a sound from
[1:11:52] Heaven of a rushing mighty and it filled
[1:11:56] all the house where they were sitting
[1:11:59] and there appeared unto them clo tongues
[1:12:02] like and sat upon each of them they were
[1:12:06] all filled with the Holy Ghost and began
[1:12:08] to speak with
[1:12:10] other gave them
[1:12:12] UTS did he return where he came as the
[1:12:17] Holy Ghost dwell within their
[1:12:21] body yet there were devout believers
[1:12:27] his
[1:12:29] coming are you with
[1:12:31] me let's remember let's talk about apus
[1:12:35] for a
[1:12:36] moment in Acts chapter 18 it speaks of a
[1:12:40] Jew named Apollos he was an eloquent man
[1:12:45] he's a mighty
[1:12:46] preacher he was mighty in the scriptures
[1:12:49] and he came to
[1:12:51] Ephesus and he was instructed in the way
[1:12:54] of Jehovah
[1:12:56] and and being fervent in spirit he
[1:12:59] taught diligently the things of the Lord
[1:13:02] KN only the baptism of
[1:13:05] John here he is it's the hour where a
[1:13:09] great coming is taking
[1:13:11] place the Holy Ghost God
[1:13:14] himself Christ has come down in the
[1:13:18] power of
[1:13:20] the and they missed it all he knows is
[1:13:25] is the baptism of
[1:13:26] John
[1:13:28] mhm and there was a quer in
[1:13:32] Priscilla heard him preach they took him
[1:13:36] aside and expounded to him the way of
[1:13:39] the Lord more
[1:13:41] perfectly you know what he they had to
[1:13:43] teach him yes John Was Elijah
[1:13:48] prophet he was the
[1:13:50] Forerunner but he introduced us to the
[1:13:54] Messi
[1:13:56] it was Jesus Christ and he's already
[1:13:59] died buried again ascended in glory come
[1:14:04] back day of
[1:14:06] p and they had missed
[1:14:09] it think of that devout Believers missed
[1:14:15] what God was
[1:14:17] doing you know why because of the
[1:14:19] blindness of the
[1:14:21] age amen amen so here was a preacher
[1:14:26] who even saw and recognizes John as that
[1:14:30] Prophet the
[1:14:32] Forerunner but failed to see Jesus
[1:14:35] Christ the
[1:14:36] Messiah John was pointing
[1:14:39] to and the Bible said in Acts chapter
[1:14:42] 19 that Paul passing through
[1:14:46] Ephesus and found certain
[1:14:49] disciples he said have youed the Holy
[1:14:51] Ghost since you
[1:14:53] believe and they so well we've not even
[1:14:56] heard whether there be any such thing as
[1:14:59] a holy
[1:15:00] ghost I I'm talking about the most
[1:15:02] important
[1:15:04] event and they totally missed
[1:15:09] it Jesus had come he had died buried
[1:15:13] resurrected ascended and come again in
[1:15:16] the form of the Holy Spirit and they
[1:15:19] totally
[1:15:20] missed and he said well how were you
[1:15:23] baptized we were baptized by John elah
[1:15:26] Prophet was not good
[1:15:28] enough and Paul Paul said John barely
[1:15:32] baptized with btis of repentance say
[1:15:35] unto the people that should believe on
[1:15:37] him which should come after him that is
[1:15:39] on Christ Jesus and when they heard this
[1:15:43] they were baptized in the name of the
[1:15:46] Lord
[1:15:47] Jesus and then they reive the same
[1:15:51] experience that they did on the day of
[1:15:53] Pentecost
[1:15:55] now
[1:15:56] today they will miss
[1:15:59] him because it is a secret Rapture of
[1:16:03] the
[1:16:05] church it's not going to be car
[1:16:09] wrecks and wicked have to stay here
[1:16:11] through the
[1:16:13] tribulation all the roofs the building
[1:16:17] repair all the
[1:16:18] cars but in this
[1:16:21] Rapture in this coming every eye will
[1:16:24] know not see
[1:16:27] him in fact this is more of a going away
[1:16:31] of the
[1:16:33] Bride than it is a
[1:16:35] coming for he does not come to the
[1:16:39] Earth but we meet him in
[1:16:42] the
[1:16:44] amen now I had an uncle one time and he
[1:16:48] said Tim I tell you you know that's why
[1:16:51] television was was invented
[1:16:54] so that when the Lord comes ever I would
[1:16:57] see
[1:16:59] him and every every tongue would have to
[1:17:02] confess
[1:17:03] him can you imagine this is the 6:00
[1:17:08] news I here to inform you there happen
[1:17:11] in the E sky
[1:17:13] today well I just I just saw former
[1:17:17] promis uh president
[1:17:22] Trump and they they're going up into the
[1:17:25] sky Bill Clinton and all the others are
[1:17:29] with them look there's a phenomenon
[1:17:32] happening in the heaven let's go over
[1:17:34] here to Los Angeles now oh there's car
[1:17:37] wrecks
[1:17:39] everywhere there is pandemonium broke
[1:17:42] out see a great one up in the
[1:17:45] sky that's not the way it's going to be
[1:17:48] he's going to come like Romeo came for
[1:17:52] Julet he comes in the night Slips Away
[1:17:55] his
[1:17:58] bride and the world won't
[1:18:01] know it's even
[1:18:03] happening amen amen now brother brandom
[1:18:07] tells us that you know in the third
[1:18:10] seal he said the Bible said everything
[1:18:13] will will be so great even to the high
[1:18:16] places will be made
[1:18:21] low and the rough places will be made
[1:18:23] plain
[1:18:25] I can imagine seeing them thinking
[1:18:27] there John would come out that great
[1:18:31] Forerunner just take all the desert and
[1:18:33] smooth it out grass on it
[1:18:37] again and they had it so fixed
[1:18:41] up like they have today but it was so
[1:18:44] humble even the apostles missed they
[1:18:47] were even asking him well isn't Elijah
[1:18:51] supposed to
[1:18:53] come they were missing what God was
[1:18:58] doing and he said brother Brandon said
[1:19:01] there wasn't I guess one third of the
[1:19:03] whole Jewish
[1:19:06] race even knew that Jesus Christ was
[1:19:10] on they might have heard some fanatic
[1:19:14] down there but they didn't pay any
[1:19:17] attention he came to his own and his own
[1:19:21] received he said not didn't say he would
[1:19:25] secretly
[1:19:27] come but the Rapture will be a
[1:19:31] secret and if that was so secret when he
[1:19:34] com that first time how much more will
[1:19:37] the Rapture
[1:19:40] be directly they'll say well I thought
[1:19:43] there was supposed to have a Rapture and
[1:19:46] all his judgments now on the
[1:19:47] earth it'll be just like a thief in the
[1:19:51] night like a book I read of Romeo and
[1:19:53] Julia lad outside the house came and got
[1:19:58] her at the night
[1:19:59] time so you see the denominational
[1:20:02] Church the world is looking for the
[1:20:05] coming of the
[1:20:06] Lord and you you have even man like
[1:20:09] Billy Graham I read an article from him
[1:20:13] and he acknowledged the first time he
[1:20:16] came he came secretly in a
[1:20:19] Manger but this time he comes ever I
[1:20:23] will see him
[1:20:25] and then he quotes the scripture from
[1:20:27] Revelation 17 the he cometh with clouds
[1:20:31] and every I shall see him and they also
[1:20:34] which pierced him all the KRS of the
[1:20:37] Earth shall
[1:20:39] well even so a man amen amen but this is
[1:20:43] not the
[1:20:45] Rapture this is not the second
[1:20:48] coming now think of this he's already
[1:20:51] come once to redeem a bride comes again
[1:20:55] for his bride then he comes a third time
[1:20:59] with his bride so in this last day there
[1:21:03] are two comings of the Lord we're going
[1:21:06] to go away and we're coming
[1:21:09] back amen are you with me so you see
[1:21:14] this scripture Revelation
[1:21:16] 1 is not the
[1:21:19] Rapture but this is his third
[1:21:21] coming when he comes and returns with
[1:21:25] the
[1:21:26] bride
[1:21:28] ration three comings like I said his
[1:21:31] first coming came reveal himself in
[1:21:33] Christ Second Coming he comes for his
[1:21:36] bride third coming is when he comes back
[1:21:39] with
[1:21:40] his now let's see who those are that
[1:21:44] pierced
[1:21:46] him let's examine this for Revelation 17
[1:21:51] the holy cometh with
[1:21:52] clouds and every ey shall
[1:21:56] and they also which pierc
[1:21:59] him all right now let's turn to
[1:22:01] Zechariah 12 and let's look at verse
[1:22:05] n and it should come to pass in that day
[1:22:09] I will seek to destroy all nations that
[1:22:11] come against Jerusalem and I will pour
[1:22:14] upon the House of David and upon the
[1:22:16] inhabitants of Jer the spirit of Grace
[1:22:20] and supplication and they shall look
[1:22:22] upon me they have pied and they shall
[1:22:27] mourn for him as one mour for his
[1:22:30] only and shall be in bitterness for him
[1:22:34] as one that is in bitterness for his
[1:22:37] first
[1:22:38] born now notice this it is now the Jews
[1:22:43] who will look on
[1:22:45] him they have
[1:22:47] pierced they will
[1:22:49] recognize we crucified our
[1:22:53] Messiah amen amen now so this is after
[1:22:57] the Rapture of chur in that day there
[1:23:01] shall be a great morning in Jerusalem
[1:23:04] morning of the valley
[1:23:07] of and the land ofor family apart Family
[1:23:12] of the House of DAV apart their wife
[1:23:14] apart the family of the House of Nathan
[1:23:15] apart their wife apart the family of the
[1:23:18] House
[1:23:20] of the family of
[1:23:22] shim and their wives all the families
[1:23:25] that remain every family apart and their
[1:23:28] wives apart so there's going to come a
[1:23:32] day of morning when they realize we
[1:23:36] crucified they will look on
[1:23:41] himed but that is not his second coming
[1:23:46] that is when he comes back
[1:23:49] with let's go to Zechariah 14 behold the
[1:23:53] day cometh that the Lord day of the Lord
[1:23:56] cometh that SP shall be divided in the
[1:23:58] midst of the I will gather all nations
[1:24:03] against the city shall be taken the
[1:24:06] houses right the women RAB after the
[1:24:09] city
[1:24:11] goity the residue of the people shall
[1:24:14] not be cut off from the
[1:24:15] city then shall the Lord go for and
[1:24:19] fight against those Nation as when he
[1:24:22] fought in the day of batt see here's his
[1:24:25] physical coming to the earth now and his
[1:24:29] feet shall stand in that
[1:24:32] day this is not the meeting in the air
[1:24:36] this is return back to the
[1:24:38] Earth and his
[1:24:41] Fe On The
[1:24:46] of of in the mid there the East the West
[1:24:51] there shall be a great Valley Mountain
[1:24:55] toward the and you shall flee to the
[1:24:59] Valley of the mountain the Valley of the
[1:25:01] mountain shall
[1:25:03] reach you shall flee like before the
[1:25:06] great Earth in the days ofah king ofah
[1:25:12] and the Lord
[1:25:14] God and all
[1:25:17] the with
[1:25:19] him this is coming back from the Battle
[1:25:23] of army G
[1:25:25] amen speak them will touch the
[1:25:28] Earth but it is coming for
[1:25:34] us amen amen amen so at this coming it
[1:25:39] that we're speaking of here it's the
[1:25:42] same as Revelation
[1:25:43] 19 he comes with all the armies of
[1:25:47] Heaven this prophecy though will not
[1:25:51] become clear until the end time
[1:25:55] the evening time verse six it to come to
[1:25:57] pass in that day that the light shall
[1:26:00] not be clear nor
[1:26:01] Darkness but it shall be one day be
[1:26:05] known to the nobody else will know it
[1:26:07] amen not day nor
[1:26:10] night pass at the
[1:26:13] evening
[1:26:17] it the
[1:26:19] scripture and reveal his
[1:26:22] coming amen amen
[1:26:24] now turn with me to Revelation
[1:26:28] 16 he says behold I come as a
[1:26:34] thief blessed is he that watch and
[1:26:38] keepeth his G let he walk
[1:26:43] naked now how does the thief
[1:26:47] come well he comes in the
[1:26:51] night and you know he walks up with a
[1:26:53] great big
[1:26:56] Rock real big rock you know and he
[1:26:59] throws it in the picture
[1:27:01] window and it busts open and he jumps
[1:27:05] through it everybody I'm aief I'm a
[1:27:10] thief is that the way a thief
[1:27:14] comes a thief comes in the night and he
[1:27:19] gets slips
[1:27:21] in he gets what he wants and he takes it
[1:27:25] away and months later you kind of wake
[1:27:29] up and say huh you know that honey you
[1:27:31] know that money I
[1:27:33] put in that you know I had
[1:27:35] it where where is that children did you
[1:27:39] see it where is this we we have some
[1:27:43] things missing in the home where is it
[1:27:46] and after a while you say we about to
[1:27:49] think you see he came in the night he
[1:27:53] got what he wanted and slipped out and
[1:27:57] this is what God will do with the he
[1:28:00] will
[1:28:02] come away the world will go right
[1:28:07] Darkness won't even know it wake up in
[1:28:11] the say there's something
[1:28:15] happen why are we here in
[1:28:17] the we thought there would be a
[1:28:21] r so he says in first Thessalonians
[1:28:25] 5 but the times in the
[1:28:27] season you have no
[1:28:30] need you yourself know perfect that the
[1:28:34] day of the Lord come as a thief in the
[1:28:38] night for when they
[1:28:40] say then sudden Destruction come upon as
[1:28:44] Trail
[1:28:46] upon but they shall
[1:28:49] not but you brother you are not in
[1:28:52] darkness that that day should over you
[1:28:56] as
[1:28:57] a you are all children of the
[1:29:00] light Children of the day we are not of
[1:29:03] the night nor of Darkness therefore let
[1:29:07] us not sleep as do others but let us
[1:29:11] was that sleep night that be
[1:29:15] drunk let us who are the day
[1:29:26] amen you see we have been awakened by
[1:29:30] Midnight Cry wise virgins go into an
[1:29:34] invisible
[1:29:35] Union the foolish in
[1:29:39] the amen amen let's look at Hebrews
[1:29:42] chapter 9 verse
[1:29:44] 28 so Christ was once offered to Bear
[1:29:47] the sins of
[1:29:49] many and unto them that will look for
[1:29:53] him shall he appeared the second time
[1:29:57] without sin under salvation amen now he
[1:30:00] came the first time without sin but this
[1:30:03] time he is saying he is he will come not
[1:30:08] to carry the burden of
[1:30:10] sin deal with sin but to bring full
[1:30:14] salvation to those who are eagerly and
[1:30:17] constantly and patiently waiting
[1:30:20] expecting his
[1:30:22] return amen amen this time he's not
[1:30:25] going to
[1:30:26] Calvary this time he's taking the people
[1:30:29] that he's
[1:30:32] redeemed amen amen so first
[1:30:34] Thessalonians
[1:30:36] 4:16 for the Lord
[1:30:39] himself shall descend from heaven with
[1:30:42] a with the voice of the
[1:30:44] AR and with the trumpet of God and the
[1:30:47] dead in Christ
[1:30:49] shall notice the Lord himself
[1:30:54] amen but you're saying brother Tim the
[1:30:57] shout is a prophet bringing a
[1:31:00] message let's go to the Book of Exodus
[1:31:04] chapter 3 and verse
[1:31:06] one and now Moses kept the flock of
[1:31:10] Jethro his
[1:31:12] father-in-law PR of he led the flock to
[1:31:15] the backside of the desert came to the
[1:31:18] Mountain of God
[1:31:19] even and the angel of the Lord appeared
[1:31:23] unto him
[1:31:24] in a flame of fire notice a pillar of
[1:31:27] fire out out of the midst of a bush and
[1:31:31] he looked and behold Bush burned with
[1:31:35] fire the Bush was not consumed and Moses
[1:31:39] said I will now turn aside and see
[1:31:41] this why the bush is not burned when the
[1:31:45] Lord saw he had turned
[1:31:47] aside god notice who it is God Called to
[1:31:53] him out of the midst of the he said
[1:31:56] Moses mes and he said here and he said
[1:31:59] draw not now here put up that shoes feet
[1:32:03] for the place where On th Holy Ground
[1:32:07] moreover he says I am the god of thy
[1:32:10] father the god of Abraham the god of
[1:32:13] Isaac God
[1:32:14] ofc and Moses in his face for he was
[1:32:18] afraid to God and the Lord said I have
[1:32:24] surely see the Affliction of my which
[1:32:27] are in Egypt have heard their Cry by the
[1:32:30] reason of
[1:32:32] their I know their
[1:32:35] sorrow listen and I
[1:32:41] am to
[1:32:43] deliver amen amen to deliver them out of
[1:32:47] the hands
[1:32:48] of Amen the
[1:32:51] Lord God had come down
[1:32:56] to meet a
[1:32:58] prophet go tell my people I'm
[1:33:02] tella Let My People you can't
[1:33:07] hold you can't hold
[1:33:14] them amen hallelujah amen and what the
[1:33:18] people see they saw a
[1:33:21] prophet with a message
[1:33:24] but he had met a of fire because the
[1:33:28] Lord himself descended with
[1:33:35] message hallelujah amen
[1:33:39] amen now Revelation
[1:33:42] 101 is a repeat of the
[1:33:45] scripture God as a messenger of his C
[1:33:49] comes down with the open
[1:33:52] book and when does he cries or shouts
[1:33:57] with a loud voice and his voice is heard
[1:34:01] through a
[1:34:03] prophet amen amen now brother Brom tells
[1:34:06] us in the
[1:34:08] mess he said the first thing is a shout
[1:34:12] a voice and a trumpet shout a messenger
[1:34:16] getting the people
[1:34:17] ready second is the voice of the
[1:34:20] Resurrection the same voice the loud
[1:34:23] voice that St John
[1:34:26] 11384 called Lazarus from the grave
[1:34:30] getting the bride together the
[1:34:32] resurrection of the Dead to be caught up
[1:34:35] with it amen amen so then we go to
[1:34:38] Revelation
[1:34:40] 81 and when he had opened the seventh
[1:34:44] seal there was silence in
[1:34:47] heaven about half an hour now the Feast
[1:34:51] of the
[1:34:52] trumpets said Revelation
[1:34:54] 10 was the seventh
[1:34:57] seal so the seventh seal is not the
[1:35:01] beginning of
[1:35:02] Silence it was the ending of
[1:35:05] Silence amen amen amen so Revelation 10
[1:35:10] he descends with an open
[1:35:14] book as brother said and what is
[1:35:17] attraction what happened on
[1:35:20] sun god confirming his word that's what
[1:35:24] all this noise is
[1:35:26] about God fulfilling his promised
[1:35:29] word again Revelation
[1:35:32] 101 in the days of the sounding of the
[1:35:34] Seven
[1:35:36] Angels the mystery of God should be
[1:35:38] finished the hidden Mystery of
[1:35:41] Revelation 10
[1:35:43] 1-7 the last message to the last Church
[1:35:47] age fulfills exactly in this age Luke
[1:35:51] 1730 the day when the son of man
[1:35:56] amen amen he speaks of the constellation
[1:35:58] of the
[1:35:59] seven and then he says the god of Heaven
[1:36:03] promised this evening time would have
[1:36:06] evening light three years ago mystery
[1:36:10] was a prophecy time is it sir now it's
[1:36:14] history it is p the promise is fulfilled
[1:36:19] what time is and what is the
[1:36:21] attraction God fulfilling
[1:36:25] the same
[1:36:28] yesterday Hallelujah am he tells us in
[1:36:31] the message of
[1:36:32] the I'm not making this up this is th
[1:36:36] say the Lord I'll read it to you right
[1:36:38] out of the book The sounding of the
[1:36:40] seventh Angel's message the mystery of
[1:36:43] God should be finished that has been
[1:36:45] declared by his holy prophet that's the
[1:36:49] prophets who's wrote the word and at the
[1:36:52] sounding of the seven churches
[1:36:54] the last Church all the
[1:36:57] Lo been through these other
[1:37:00] ages be together and then the seals are
[1:37:04] broken the mystery is revealed and down
[1:37:08] comes the angel the messenger Christ
[1:37:12] setting his foot upon the L on the sea
[1:37:15] with the rainbow of his head remember
[1:37:19] the seventh angel is on Earth at the
[1:37:22] time of
[1:37:25] amen so while the seventh angel here he
[1:37:29] comes down with an
[1:37:32] open it's not sealed anymore open the
[1:37:36] Mysteries are
[1:37:38] no they are
[1:37:40] revealed
[1:37:42] hallelu amen amen not some thousand foot
[1:37:47] tall
[1:37:47] Jesus in Revelation 10 was Christ coming
[1:37:51] as the word to the seventh angel
[1:37:55] Messenger on
[1:37:57] Earth but it's not
[1:37:59] revealed until the denominational ages
[1:38:02] has run
[1:38:03] out so in
[1:38:05] the this book is not revealed until the
[1:38:09] church ages not ages out and there's
[1:38:12] time no more and it's only revealed
[1:38:15] after church ages denominational
[1:38:18] agent so here we are at the end of the
[1:38:22] last AG

[1:38:25] Ages there ain't no more to come it's
[1:38:28] over with amen the ages are finishing up

[1:38:49] amen so here we
[1:38:51] are L listen what he said
[1:38:53] said he's coming directly to Israel he
[1:38:55] said this seven seal book is revealed at
[1:38:59] the time of the seven thunders of
[1:39:02] Revelation
[1:39:03] 10 if you're marking it down turn to
[1:39:06] Revelation 10 just a moment so you'll
[1:39:08] get an understand and I saw another
[1:39:11] Mighty Angel come
[1:39:13] from the CL rainbow
[1:39:16] was you notice that's Christ because he
[1:39:19] is in the Old Testament called the angel
[1:39:22] of the Cen and he's coming directly to
[1:39:25] the Jews for the church is finished all
[1:39:29] right and his face as it was as and his
[1:39:32] feet as pillars of fire his face the
[1:39:35] sun he said remember that in Revelation
[1:39:39] in the first revelation one Angel there
[1:39:42] same thing Angel is a messenger and he's
[1:39:45] a messenger to Israel see the church has
[1:39:49] been raptured now or fixing
[1:39:55] and he comes for his church look what
[1:39:58] he's doing he he does what he comes down
[1:40:02] with the open book to get a bride out of
[1:40:05] here so he can turn back to the
[1:40:09] Jews so he's coming directly to the Jew
[1:40:13] but he's got to take a bride
[1:40:15] out am amen this is why brother Bram
[1:40:18] tells us my
[1:40:21] mission is to forun the common
[1:40:24] word which is
[1:40:27] Christ this is what the prophet was sent
[1:40:30] to
[1:40:31] do to bring us back to the word
[1:40:35] again amen am brother bam said the bride
[1:40:39] must step out of the way to go up so the
[1:40:43] two servants God in Revelation 11 the
[1:40:47] two prophets can appear on the scene
[1:40:50] sound the seventh trumpet to
[1:40:52] them to them the Christ the seventh
[1:40:55] angel messenger say behold
[1:41:00] God not behold my Methodist or my
[1:41:03] Baptist my P the word the Son of God
[1:41:08] lamb God that takes away the sin world
[1:41:11] for no other
[1:41:13] Foundation how long have we got Jews are
[1:41:16] in their Homeland the is called
[1:41:18] scripturally Everything Is promis We
[1:41:22] Ready the hour is
[1:41:25] here amen amen now what happened it was
[1:41:29] that the mighty Angel Christ of
[1:41:32] Revelation
[1:41:33] 10 descended with a
[1:41:37] shout amen a mighty message and it and
[1:41:42] that message came to the seventh angel
[1:41:46] of Revelation
[1:41:48] 10 so the son of man Christ come to a
[1:41:52] son of
[1:41:54] Manet so the for the word always comes
[1:41:59] to Prophet 3 and and when he did seven
[1:42:04] Thunders seven voices of God the word
[1:42:07] sounded their voice to the seventh angel
[1:42:11] and revealed what before was only
[1:42:14] symbols in the
[1:42:16] Bible and John was allowed to write what
[1:42:19] he
[1:42:20] saw but not what he heard
[1:42:24] right amen he saw a white horse and his
[1:42:29] rider but the
[1:42:31] interpretation the voice of God which is
[1:42:34] the interpretation
[1:42:35] of was what he heard he couldn't
[1:42:39] write what he heard but he was commanded
[1:42:43] to be sealed up to the
[1:42:46] End Amen but it would not be sealed
[1:42:49] forever because in the days of the
[1:42:53] the seventh angel when he began
[1:42:56] to this mystery will be finished amen
[1:43:01] amen you see it was a thunder because it
[1:43:04] was something that God did not want to
[1:43:06] be made known Until the End Time a
[1:43:10] thunder is always the voice of God and
[1:43:13] when God speaks it's a thunder and but
[1:43:16] it comes as a thunder when he doesn't
[1:43:19] want it made known yet but when it is
[1:43:22] time for the revelation
[1:43:24] is no longer a thunder it is a known
[1:43:28] Voice Hallelujah am amen it's no longer
[1:43:31] a
[1:43:32] ther we know what the voice of
[1:43:36] God we have
[1:43:39] heard amen amen so Revelation 10 is the
[1:43:44] seven seal when the seventh seal was
[1:43:47] open the Silence of those
[1:43:50] Thunders the seventh seal was not the
[1:43:52] beginning
[1:43:54] to open it was to open up the silence it
[1:43:58] was to break the silence what had been
[1:44:01] silence the voice of the Thunder John
[1:44:04] was going to write it and God silenced
[1:44:06] it until the days of the voice of the
[1:44:10] Seven
[1:44:10] Angels amen where you could hear the
[1:44:15] interpretation of the symbols written in
[1:44:18] the
[1:44:19] scripture amen amen this was the coming
[1:44:22] of the word both restored and revealed
[1:44:27] to a Prophet this is what he said he
[1:44:29] would do Revelation 10 and I saw another
[1:44:33] Mighty
[1:44:35] Angel only Christ is be clothed with a
[1:44:38] cloud rainbow
[1:44:41] is that represents the full entire
[1:44:45] Covenant SP as well as it were the
[1:44:48] sun amen it's with an unveiled face no
[1:44:52] longer just in types Shadow
[1:44:57] Mysteries symbols but
[1:45:01] coming light of the
[1:45:03] word he had in his
[1:45:06] hand no longer closed and he set his
[1:45:09] right foot on the sea left foot on the
[1:45:12] earth and he
[1:45:14] shouted voice that's when I lion Ro what
[1:45:18] was it the King was speaking amen when
[1:45:22] he said
[1:45:24] seven Thunders
[1:45:25] under in the prophet's
[1:45:27] message seven
[1:45:29] thund what had been becomes
[1:45:36] revealed Hallelujah and when the seven
[1:45:40] Thunders I was to WR and I Heard a Voice
[1:45:44] from saying unto me seal up the
[1:45:49] things and write him you see that's the
[1:45:52] shell
[1:45:54] the first phase of his
[1:45:57] coming the next is the second
[1:46:01] phase so now the word that has been
[1:46:07] brought has to become
[1:46:11] flesh amen you see it can't remain in
[1:46:14] books and
[1:46:17] Tes amen are you with me amen it must
[1:46:22] become
[1:46:25] the
[1:46:27] word
[1:46:29] become it cannot
[1:46:32] remain form got to move
[1:46:37] from
[1:46:39] flesh
[1:46:41] amen hallelujah amen so then second
[1:46:45] phase
[1:46:46] of is the word in Bride form
[1:46:54] it's the same revealing of the son of
[1:46:57] man but now it's an bride
[1:47:03] form and rising of the
[1:47:05] Sun as Christ was the first one to raise
[1:47:08] out of the
[1:47:09] prop typed in many places he was the
[1:47:13] first fruit of those
[1:47:15] slept in the bride coming of
[1:47:18] Christ coming out of the church there
[1:47:21] has to be a she wave in the
[1:47:24] last notice what he said in the bride
[1:47:27] coming of
[1:47:29] Christ because before we can meet him in
[1:47:32] the
[1:47:33] air he would first have to send the
[1:47:38] word and when that
[1:47:42] word then he can
[1:47:45] come can
[1:47:53] amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen
[1:47:58] amen so now he said the waving of the
[1:48:01] sheep what was it the first to come to
[1:48:04] mature the first that proved it was weak
[1:48:07] proved it was a sheep Hallelujah I see
[1:48:10] I'm sure you see what I'm talking about
[1:48:13] was waved over the people for the first
[1:48:15] time that will come forth for the bright
[1:48:18] age for a resurrection out of dark
[1:48:24] will be a message that the full maturity
[1:48:27] of the word has turned
[1:48:30] back full power and has being waved over
[1:48:33] the People by the same signs and
[1:48:37] wonders back
[1:48:39] there hallelujah amen so the second
[1:48:42] phase of his is the voice of the Ark
[1:48:47] Angel amen amen and where is an
[1:48:50] archangel promise to come
[1:48:54] in Revelation chap 10 and I saw another
[1:49:00] Mighty amen so now as we look at
[1:49:05] this the word must always take on
[1:49:09] flesh it cannot always remain as a
[1:49:13] Doctrine or as a
[1:49:15] knowledge it must take on
[1:49:19] flesh that's why it now takes on flesh
[1:49:23] as the people called The
[1:49:26] Bride brother brandom tells us spoken
[1:49:28] words original
[1:49:30] SE as the end time prophecies will
[1:49:34] repeat believe as the first Forerunner
[1:49:37] came from the
[1:49:38] Wilderness the hold the Lamb of God the
[1:49:41] second
[1:49:42] Forerunner probably do the same
[1:49:45] appointing the people a word
[1:49:50] bde do you realize that brother Bram for
[1:49:54] around your
[1:49:58] coming my message produce a
[1:50:01] bride my
[1:50:03] prophecy will prophesy a bride
[1:50:08] into this is where we're at the word FLH
[1:50:13] and the flesh BEC
[1:50:16] word hallelujah amen so the second phase
[1:50:20] of
[1:50:21] the is the brag coming of
[1:50:25] Christ CU he's not going to come Rapture
[1:50:27] tapes and
[1:50:30] books he's going to take his
[1:50:34] word which is in
[1:50:37] flesh the word bride to be United with
[1:50:41] the word
[1:50:43] gr hallelujah amen amen so this time he
[1:50:49] comes in a multim membered body of
[1:50:57] people and they become the
[1:50:59] voice of the
[1:51:02] Resurrection as they are the resurrected
[1:51:05] ones out of cold dark denominational
[1:51:09] tombs of
[1:51:12] religion amen the first fruits of the
[1:51:16] Resurrection the first ones up from the
[1:51:20] dead amen people who are not in the
[1:51:23] denominational
[1:51:26] tombs amen but they have risen out
[1:51:29] of they are
[1:51:31] alive never to go back
[1:51:36] into hallelujah amen Revelation 10 the
[1:51:41] mighty angel said to John and he's
[1:51:44] symbolic of the
[1:51:46] Bride he's not symbolic of one
[1:51:49] Preacher Brother never taught that he
[1:51:53] represents the bride one man
[1:51:56] representing the
[1:51:58] entire and he says go take the
[1:52:01] book eat it and then
[1:52:04] prophesy speak become the voice of the
[1:52:08] book amen become the voice not of the
[1:52:11] closed
[1:52:13] book open don't run without a message
[1:52:18] eat the book and then prophesy and
[1:52:21] prophesy
[1:52:23] become the
[1:52:25] voice and the angel
[1:52:28] Christ amen see the bride becomes the
[1:52:33] voice of the
[1:52:35] resurrection showing the world that
[1:52:38] Christ Hasen
[1:52:40] again in his people she's out of the
[1:52:44] Tomb and never never will we go
[1:52:50] back never
[1:52:53] can you be sealed
[1:52:57] backb to be shut away
[1:53:07] again am hallelujah
[1:53:10] amen true Easter
[1:53:13] seal said and today they're trying to
[1:53:16] keep Christ in the
[1:53:18] Tom oh what an Easter
[1:53:20] morning an Easter ruined all their
[1:53:24] theology Easter morning came people at
[1:53:28] church 1900 years later it ruined their
[1:53:32] theology he's not dead He's
[1:53:35] Alive and they can't keep him two you
[1:53:39] can't put him in a
[1:53:42] method
[1:53:44] Oran
[1:53:46] whatever but
[1:53:48] heed and is
[1:53:50] alive he said had a Baptist tomb might a
[1:53:54] Methodist Tom one day Jesus rose there
[1:53:59] from a historical God to a living
[1:54:01] present
[1:54:05] God hallelujah amen so she the bride
[1:54:10] becomes the final voice to the final
[1:54:14] age so brother Bram tells us these other
[1:54:18] ages
[1:54:19] fa but he said but God had raised up
[1:54:22] other
[1:54:23] has gone on through the
[1:54:24] years until in this last day there will
[1:54:28] be another people in the land who under
[1:54:31] their Messengers will be the final voice
[1:54:36] to the final Ed amen amen said the
[1:54:39] church is no longer the mouthpiece of
[1:54:41] God it is its own
[1:54:44] mouthpiece so God is turning
[1:54:46] on he will confound her through the
[1:54:49] prophet and the
[1:54:51] bride for voice of God will be in
[1:54:55] her for it says in the last chapter
[1:54:58] Revelation verse 17 the spirit and the
[1:55:03] bride Hallelujah once more the world
[1:55:07] will hear
[1:55:10] direct but of course the word bride will
[1:55:13] be repudiated
[1:55:16] as but he says God still has a voice for
[1:55:20] the people of the world
[1:55:23] amen he's given a voice to the bride
[1:55:26] that voice is in the
[1:55:28] Bride As we have said Hallelujah am amen
[1:55:32] so the voice calls for the bride to
[1:55:36] unite with Christ the word and there is
[1:55:39] a marriage there is uniting of the Lamb
[1:55:42] word to the
[1:55:46] bride this is the invisible
[1:55:49] Union amen it's to prepare us for the
[1:55:52] visible
[1:55:54] un amen amen thus the bride and the word
[1:55:59] becomes one am and once that voice
[1:56:03] becomes totally
[1:56:05] manifested in Bride for in and every
[1:56:08] member of that bride in their ordained
[1:56:12] position in
[1:56:14] Christ that will call the Dead from the
[1:56:18] other
[1:56:19] dimension and our eyes will behold
[1:56:23] love as we see them we will be
[1:56:27] changed amen and in a
[1:56:31] moment and we'll be traveling like
[1:56:34] a
[1:56:36] and Jesus did
[1:56:40] Resurrection C
[1:56:43] up hallelujah amen what a promise that
[1:56:47] is now we come to the
