Praise the Lord. God bless you. Such a privilege to be here. How many have just How many just want to tell the Lord, "Thank you for coming by my way." &gt;&gt; You want to tell the Lord that? Say, "God, thank you for coming and speaking to me." Why don't we just do that just now? Thank you, Jesus. Thank you for a touch, Lord. Thank you for a word of encouragement. Thank you for the hope you brought to fathers and mothers. Thank you for healing you brought to the afflicted and the diseased. Thank you for the salvation you brought to the lost. Lord, we believe you've done wonderful things in these meetings. We don't look to the physical evidence, though you give us that. We look to one thing, and that's you promised it and we believe it. And I pray God, the seed that's been sown in these meetings, may it be planted in good ground. May it bring forth, Lord, that which you intended it. For you promised, Lord, cast your bread upon the waters, and it won't return unto you void, but it will accomplish the purpose that it was sent for. I pray no one would leave here, Lord God, with a cup empty, but full Lord, full, oh God, with fresh faith, fresh zeal, Lord, a fresh ability to reach out at the impossible and take a hold of the promise of God for their life, for their family, for their marriage, for their children. We speak a blessing, Lord God, upon this church. May it be a renewed vision for evening like Tabernacle. May they look to the greater. May they look, Lord, don't ever stop pressing to that mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus. Let's look to new horizons, Lord. Let's look to the next chapter. Let's look for the miracle, God, that you want to perform in our storm. Thank you, Lord, for your servants. Thank you for brother Andrew, for brother Ron, Lord, for brother Tim, Lord Jesus, all the ministry at this church, the music, the deacons, the trustees. I pray you'd give them a double portion, Lord. May you just bless them, Lord, for their sacrifice this weekend. But now, Lord, we stand here and still in need of you. God, we come here, Lord, with a fresh desire to hear from heaven again. I pray God that you would just be the guest amongst us. Come and speak through your word, Lord. Use me, Father, the foolishness of preaching. It's foolish, Lord, because I'm I'm full of so many fears and doubts myself as any human being is. any any person, Lord, with faults and mistakes and failures. That's why you called it foolish, Lord, could use me, God. But you could put an eternal gift down in my life. And if we'd look beyond the human veil of flesh and a man, Lord, and you'd use a vessel this morning, then I just pray there'd be edification to the body of Christ this morning. Use my words, Lord, to tear the devil's kingdom down. Use my words to expose lies of the devil. Lord, may a soul be set free this morning. May they walk out of here in the liberty, Lord, of Jesus Christ, never to be the same again. Come and accomplish your purpose. Lord, we love you with all of our hearts. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." God bless you. Amen. If you have your Bible, we'll turn to the book of Genesis, chapter 19. Just want to say again how much of a awesome time it's been here to be here with you. How many believes that the Lord Jesus spoke to you last night in that service? I know he did me and did me a great deal of of good there hearing those testimonies. I told brother Ron got in the car last night. kind of said, "Brother Ron, there's one thing that's true. The devil hates your guts." But you know why? Cuz Jesus loves you. &gt;&gt; Jesus has such a love for him. And that's why the target of the enemy comes. Amen. He can't stop the word, so he tries to stop the vessel. Amen. But we just we're thankful for what God has done in these meetings. And also, Brother Andrew, and Amen. And I just love servants of the Lord that just love God's people. Amen. Genesis chapter 19. I want to just minister you today. And I'm going to minister what the Lord told me before I came to these meetings. What I would preach this morning. Didn't know Friday night the Lord changed me. But this morning I told brother Tim this week a week or so ago that God had just come and so confirmed this. So you just want to say Lord let me be sensitive to what you want to speak. Let me have an ear to hear. You know, faith isn't dull of hearing. &gt;&gt; You might be, but your faith, Brother Brandham said, that little woman who touched the hymn of his garment, he said she had many hindrances, but her faith didn't have any hindrance. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and the prophet of God said it this way. He said, you know, that the Lord Jesus was God's gift to the world. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; And he says, "And the father showed his gift where to go, what to do, what to say, what to speak. He led him and pulled him in directions. And he said, "And the father had shown Jesus everywhere to go." And he says, "But he didn't show him that little woman." And the prophet says it this way. He says, "But she by her faith reached out and pulled out from God's gift what she needed in her life." That's why Jesus said, "Who touched me?" He didn't even see it coming. And the prophet says if she could do that, then you could reach out by your need. You got a burden, you got a need this morning, you could reach out by faith and operate the gift of God. Amen. And pull out from the Lord Jesus what you need. Answers to questions, heal it in your body, deliverance from sin. It's here this morning. I believe it comes with the atonement. And we've got the atonement. It's just as alive today as it was the day that the blood was shed. Amen. So, we just want to uh we want to turn our hearts now to the Lord. I want to minister to you and I'm going to give this title, the legacy of Lot. The legacy of Lot. Now, we're going to go through a storm. Going to be dark clouds, lightning, but just hold on. &gt;&gt; The sun will come out again. &gt;&gt; So, can you go with me through the storm? And there came two angels. Let's look at verse one. To Sodom at even, that's important to a believer, meaning even or evening time. Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. And Lot seeing them rose up to meet them. And he bowed himself with his face towards the ground. And he said, "Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servants's house, and tarry all night. wash your feet, and you shall rise up and go on your ways." They said, "Nay, but we will abide in the street all night." And he pressed upon them greatly, and they turned unto him, and entered into his house. And he made them a feast and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat. But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compass the house roundabout. Now, notice how the Bible says this. both old and young, all the people from every quarter. The disease of Sodom had spread not just to the youth, but to the old and every quarter in the city. And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came into thee this night? Bring them out unto us that we may know them. Lot went in out the door unto them and shut the door after him. And I want you to notice the condition of Lot. Now remember what a prophet taught us. Lot was a Peter said a righteous man. &gt;&gt; They called him he calls him just Lot. In other words, justified. &gt;&gt; He came out under the blessing of Abraham. And the prophet says he was a believer with a backsliden heart. But he had became such in a state of compromise that notice what he says here in the first in the next verse here and he says in verse 7 I and said I pray you brethren he's calling these men brethren do not so wickedly I think he got a part of that gospel that Moab tried to preach to the children of Israel. Hey, we're all the same and there's really no difference between you and us and you got to sacrifice and you know you believe in the in in God. Brother Madam says, "Oh, but God is the one who puts a difference in your life." &gt;&gt; Let me say it this way. You are not them and they are not you. &gt;&gt; You ought to be different cuz God separated you from Lot &gt;&gt; from Sodom. Notice this, brethren. Behold now two daughters which have not known man. Let me I pray you bring them out unto you and do you so do you to them as good in your eyes only unto these men do nothing for therefore they came under the shadow of my roof and they said stand back they said again the one fellow came into sojourn and he will needs be a judge let's move on down just before you're seated to verse 25 and he overthrow those cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew upon the ground but his wife looked back from behind behind him and she became a pillar of salt. It's amazing because you know the scripture very well in Luke 17 and Jesus calls back this moment and said as it was in the days of Noah where they did eat and drink until the day Noah entered the ark and in the days of Lot. And Jesus says remember Lot's wife. Now remember, no age has ever faced what you're facing today. The combination of the days of Noah and the days of Lot. But this is the age the son of man is revealed. The word made flesh, not just in a prophet, but in a body. &gt;&gt; How many would just have a need? You want to raise your hand and just bow your heads with me? Jesus, we feel your uncction just now. Lord God, I stand here just now and I become subservient, Lord, to your spirit that wants to speak. I pray, oh God, that you would just have your perfect way. Lord, use my words that are God's sent I believe from you and may they just bring freedom to your children. I ask it now Lord as I just set myself aside. I pray God that you would use me in Jesus name. Amen. You can be seated this morning. We preached on this on Friday night how that Abraham had left Mesopotamia. That messo meaning between Patamia. The rivers actually three rivers came out of the Eden, the Nile, the Tigris and the Euphrates River. We know those were spiritual and had all had spiritual significance. But Abraham came from between the rivers. And he came and crossed and he started his journey leaving Mesopotamia as we said on Friday, everything that he ever knew in his life. And and God had brought him out. Abraham was not a good man. And even brother Brandham says this here in in the patriarch Abraham and says Abraham was not a righteous not a now he's called a the seed of faith but he didn't start out that way. In fact Isaiah 43 says that God delivered him from the pit. He was just like anybody else that was delivered from the pit. I know the Jews would love you to believe it was because of his faith, but it didn't start out that way. In fact, Abram wasn't even fully obedient to God when God told him to leave. Because what was going to give Abram the most trouble in his journey was not actually being obedient, but it was what he brought with him when God said, "Separate yourself." He brings his family. I'm I'm sorry, his father. And God didn't tell him to do that. God said, "Separate yourself." So, he doesn't start as an overcomer. He doesn't start fully obedient to the word. In fact, it was his father who would give him most of the trouble in his journey and and cause him the most distraction from getting to the promises of God. Listen friends, I hope you realize it will not be uh you know what will be your most trouble is not your brother. It's not your sister. It's not your pastor. It's not the deacon. It'll be you. Brother Brandham says, "I looked in the mirror and realized my number one enemy is Bill Brham. A and this was this is what gives us most of our trouble in our life. It's it's our own human makeup of who we are born with and the character traits that we have and the things that are passed down from one generation to the next generation. How many knows that brother Brandham said that we all come from the grabag of life and out of that grabag you get many things that you didn't choose, you didn't sign up for, you didn't get to pick. Listen, when you were born and God, you know, came into this earth, I don't know about you, but I didn't get to, you know, do that create your own player kind of thing. I didn't choose what size I'd be, what height I'd be, what color skin I'd have, what color hair I'd have. Did you get that choice, somebody? That's not fair. If I, Brother Joe, you didn't get that choice, did you? &gt;&gt; Digging to choose how tall you were, how much you weighed. I guarantee you, we depicted a lot different than how how we see ourselves. But God created us in a certain way. Let me say it further. Put us in a certain family. Knew the home we'd grow up in. Knew the church we'd be a Listen, you can't fit in other churches. That don't make your church right and my church wrong. God just called you to be in a different uh uh place uh geographically, nationally. You may not be in America and and you may God may have called you to be somewhere else. Uh, we're not trying to be somebody or try to be somebody else or try to match me with match and I match you and you match me. Listen friends, God just wants you to be who you are because you have challenges you'll face that I don't have. Thank God you don't have to deal with the Watkins traits that I have to deal with. But thank God I don't have to deal with your traits either cuz God didn't call me to it. You see, David could not slay Goliath with another man's slingshot. He had to use what God put in his hands. And God is saying, "I've made you a certain way. You've got certain traits you've got got to overcome. And all you got to do is surrender those human traits and take on the new traits of your earthly father. I'm not an American. I'm not a can can. You're not a Canadian. You're not a a Belgium. You're not a European." Uh listen friends, we're not identified by the country a a citizen. I'm glad I'm born in the South. I was going to tell you, praise God. God, I wasn't born in the north. Nothing against you northerners, but it's just the way life. But I realized a long time ago, I'm not a northerner, a southerner, an eastern, a westerner, Republican, Democrat. I'm a child of God. And my identity is found in my birthplace, which is the word of God. &gt;&gt; And Abram's most of his trouble would come from his own daddy. And brother Brandham sees it this way. You notice in paradox when the man comes to brother Brandham, it's actually his family and they father mother and father father says mother father says we want to know what's wrong with our son. is a good boy raised in church, you know, uh we raised him, right? He was baptized and and you know, good name among brother Brandon says, "Well, I don't doubt any of those things." He says, "I'm not saying he wasn't but you know, baptized. I'm not saying he's not a Christian in name." And he says, "But but but until his life copes with his testimony &gt;&gt; and he says, see, you saying you've got the Holy Ghost and you having it is alltogether different." &gt;&gt; And the father and mother say, "What's wrong with our boy?" Notice brother Vanam immediately goes to his mother says, "Now look at you. Your your family is Germans. Nothing against the Germans." They just shut me off the live stream right there. Hold on. And he says, "Notice they're Germans. Very independent, irreverent towards religion. Many a fine morning." He says, "I go down to see your mother. There she is in the yard and walk down the road." And he says, "I I I look at her and say, "Good morning, ma'am." She just sit there and stare at me. She a fine morning, Brother says, "Intelligent woman. Nothing wrong with her." And he says, "But very independent, you know." He says, "Uh, sure. Fine morning. Good to see you this morning." He said, "She just sit there and stare at me." A lot like a lot of people do at church when I'm preaching to them. No matter what you say, man, they just have that stare. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, but notice, he says, intelligent woman, very irreependent nature. And then he talks about the father. And he says, notice you, all of this is brother Brandon's own family. He says, you know, all your families are fighters and alcoholics and drunks. And and he says, you know, Brandham's died with their boots on there. He says, that's part of your your human makeup. It's part of that human nature. It's part of that real enemy that you really got. And he says all of them, he says, "Fighters, hightempered, highrung, Irish, uh, moody, temperamental." I know y'all ain't got nobody like that in this church, so I just preach to those in South Carolina. High-tempered, moody, highrung, &gt;&gt; just fly off the handle at anything. And then somehow, amazingly, we get the Holy Ghost and we think, well, that's just who I am. I mean, I I know I got the Holy Ghost, but that's just how that's just my family. That's just my That might be what your testimony is, but my testimony is the blood of Jesus overcomes my human strains, my human complexes, my family heritage. Listen friends, the blood of Jesus erases that and you come, as the Bible said, a new creature in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; And notice he says, "But look at you." Notice it's incredible because the mystery of the boy laid in the mother and the father. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon never even mentions the boy. He talks about the mother and the father and the human traits that were affecting that boy. I think if we'd catch a revelation, we would realize that most of our problems come because we make excuses &gt;&gt; because that's just how I am. That's just how I was raised. And you know, but that's just how I'll always be. And my family was that way. That's just how I'll be. And my daddy was that way. And that's how I'll be. And my mama was that just in my family. You know, I'm just different than you. And and God's just going to wink at those things, you know, and just be be okay with that temper and be okay with that jealousy and be okay with that lust and be okay with, you know, God's not okay with any of it. I'm just preaching here. &gt;&gt; And and and many of those things, the mystery. But notice, he says, "But look at you, mama." And he says, "You are the only one out of all your sisters." &gt;&gt; And he says, "And you're not that way." &gt;&gt; And he says, "And look at you, daddy. Out of all of your family." And he says, "All of them drunk and he but you're not that way." &gt;&gt; And brother, I love how he says this in paradox. He says, "What does that &gt;&gt; and he says, you're the only one out of all your family and you've received the Lord Jesus in your life." And then he says, "You notice it's not your people anymore. It's your Christ living down on the inside of you." you. Oh my brother, I want to have that kind of testimony to say it's not my family. It's not my family complexes or my family strains. It's my Christ living on the inside of me. I am a new creature in Christ Jesus. All things are passed away. Prophet of God looks there and he's thinking about his own life. He's thinking about a little boy and he says, "There I was on the riverbank just as a little nine-year-old boy." He says, "I always grew up that way. Nobody really loved me." in school. He said, "I people thought I was odd. Didn't have no friends." And he says, "Mom and daddy were drunks and party. They party in there and music real loud." And he says, "I I never found anybody that loved me until I met the Lord Jesus." &gt;&gt; He said, "And I found somebody who really loved me for my worth, for who I am." And he says, "There I was on the river bank there, eight, nine years old." And he says, "Laying there," he says, "Just watching, waiting for the party to end. Mom and daddy there." He says, "I was up on there in the in the in the winter time." And he says, "Real cold." Imagine a 9-year-old boy and his mother and father drinking like that. And and and and and brother Bam not wanting to be around that. And and and he's there and he's there at the river there at the creek and he's just fishing and he's fishing as his dog there. And brother Bam's just contemplating this in the winter time there in the summertime and and here's the summer and he's there and and he has his dog and his fishing pole and and he says he's just sitting there and he says you know he says I I'd been there in the winter and I'd built a fire there to stay warm and till I could go home and he says there I was and looking around. He says, "I I I noticed a little flower coming up just here." And he says, "I thought, hey, how'd you get there? You you you shouldn't be there." &gt;&gt; And he says, "I was just here last year and the snow covered you over." And he says, "And the frost covered you over." And he says, "And worse than that, I built a fire over top of you." &gt;&gt; And he says, "But somehow you're here. and you're blooming and you're blossoming. The prophet of God suddenly something strikes his heart and he realizes he's that little flower and the devil tried to throw everything at him. Tried to give every give him the kitchen sink. Listen to me, brother Ron. The devil has thrown everything at you. But in spite of it all, against all odds, against all odds, you're here this morning. Oh, come on, somebody. There's only one reason you believe it and stand for the message of the hour. It's the grace of almighty God has been real to your life. &gt;&gt; And in spite of everything the devil's thrown your way, here you are. &gt;&gt; Let me just say it this way. In spite of everyone walking away from this message, here you are with the faith in your heart to believe it with all that's within you. Prophet of God said, "I heard a voice at that moment and it said, you are not the son of Charles and Helbrom." &gt;&gt; What was it? He was hearing from his theophony who he really was in the back part of God's mind before life ever began. Abraham comes out this way and it's incredible because this is the trouble that he has and he goes and as we preached on Friday he passes that test and he moves on past that and then he continues his journey. We just want to pick it up here just for a moment and he's brings his nephew Lot. He brings his nephew Lot with him. You know, Lot is one of the most striking contrast in the Bible. Who's a man who began his journey living literally under the shadow of one of the greatest men in history, one of the greatest men in the Bible. And he begins his journey with Lot, with Abraham. He's very blessed because of that. He began his journey journeying with him beside him. This is a man who is called the friend of God. I don't want to be around those kind of friends. &gt;&gt; He's a friend of God. a man who has the blessing of God upon his life. And yet somehow Lot's legacy, how his story begins is also different how it ends. &gt;&gt; He ends that story in a cave, stripped of nearly everything except the mercy that pulled him out of Sodom. And there he is and his life leaves behind such a haunting legacy. I'm preaching to you this morning on the legacy of Lot. Now, I just want to say this here this morning. When you hear the word legacy, don't think of legacy as the world defines it as some type even the denominations use those word legacy. And I'm not necessarily preaching against that, but that's not what I'm preaching on today. Legacy is is more. In fact, the Bible doesn't even use the word legacy, but it uses a different word, inheritance. That a godly man will leave an inheritance to his children and his children's children. But it's not talking about an earthly monetary house or car or business or those kind of things. But it actually is talking about a spiritual legacy &gt;&gt; that has left a mark on generation after generation after generation. Long, Brother Brandham says, after that man's gone, your life will carry an influence. Your voice that you speak now, the prophet said, circles the earth and it never dies. &gt;&gt; And so the legacy that that that we're talking about today is a spiritual legacy. One that a father leaves, a grandfather leaves, and he's a pillar to that family, a pillar to that home. And he's and he and it's it's it's what they're leaving their mark that they make on the future. Their mark, the imprint that they leave behind. Prophet of God says it that way in influence. You're leaving, you're influencing, your life is influencing somebody. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, sisters. Your younger sister is watching you. &gt;&gt; Come on, older brothers. I I just feel this from the Lord. This is fresh on my heart. Your little brother's watching your life &gt;&gt; and you don't realize the decisions you make and what compromises you allow in your life. That younger person will take it 10 times further than you did. Come on, mama. Your children are watching you. They're watching your standard. They're watching how you dress. They're watching how you deal with sin, what you allow, what you don't allow. Uh I'm just going to go and preach on it, daddies. They're watching what you allow to come across that screen on your TV or your whatever you want to call smartphone or a monitor, whatever you want to call it, computer monitor. &gt;&gt; They're watching what you allow on that house. &gt;&gt; They're watching. They're depending upon a man who will stand for the word of God. &gt;&gt; And take a stand in spite of what it looks like or how popular or unpopular it is. &gt;&gt; Listen, children will follow the example that's set before them. They're looking for someone to be strong, not a lot, wishy-washy compromiser. Prophet of God said that the he he was a backsliden believer. He's a man who who the the Bible says that the sins of Sodom vexed his righteous soul. The word vex is as the Greek word there is is to be worn down. It wore him down to live in that compromised state where he was a compromiser with the word of God. Didn't know where he stood. Was a jellyfish. The prophet of God said it this way. He says, "The sins of Sodom bothered him, but he didn't have the downright gumption &gt;&gt; to say something about it." &gt;&gt; Do you realize it is most of the time for Lot, it wasn't just one choice he made, but it was his weak position. on everything that he could never be strong on what he believed &gt;&gt; and and and and and he goes here and I just feel in the inspiration I'm not following my notes at all and that's when I feel the best but he's a compromiser he doesn't he he he doesn't know where he stands he doesn't know what he believes he's sort of wishy-washy in and out and the example that he's that he's leaving behind the legacy of what he's leaving behind the imprint that he's leaving behind. What he's trans what he's transmitting to his family. Oh my brother, let me just preach it to you and say I don't want that. There will be nothing worse than getting to heaven when getting if you go by the way of the the grave and you go to hell, there will be hell will be bad. Let me tell you right now, hell will be a horrible place. &gt;&gt; It's where the that's where there's no God. Brother man said there and when he falls down and he's feel like he's falling, he said the worst part was there was no God there. You know, you know what? You know what the worst part about one of the worst parts about heaven? I'm sorry about hell. One of the worst parts about hell is what won't be there. &gt;&gt; There won't be no preacher to try to preach to you. There won't be no mother to pray for you. There won't be no God there. The presence of God will be void from that place. It will be what's absent. &gt;&gt; You know what the worst part? I couldn't imagine. You say, "Is there something worse than going to hell?" Yes, there's something worse than going to hell. Think about your life. Think about your children. Think about your uncle, your aunt, your cousin, your brother, your sister. You imagine what would be worse than going to hell. Something worse than going to hell. Brother Ron, it'll be those that go with me. &gt;&gt; And I had the moment. I had the chance to change their life, &gt;&gt; to point them in a different direction, but they followed my footsteps of compromise and watered down. You know, half of I half, you know, kind of never really a man to take a stand, but now, you know, daddy believed the message, but really he didn't really live it. That's not a testimony you should ever have. &gt;&gt; You know, my daddy believed the message all his heart, but he allowed this kind of compromise. I couldn't imagine nothing. There's nothing worse than going to hell will be the what's worse than is those who have followed me, those who have been influenced by my life and now I've got to live under the condemnation daily uh every moment thinking how I all of the people that have followed me to this place. Couldn't imagine my brother, my sister, but there is something worse than going to hell. But can I just say heaven's going to be awesome, brother Ron? I'm going to be on the streets of gold, but there's something better than going to heaven. You say, "Brother Matt, how could heaven be better?" I tell you what will be better than going to heaven. It will be my family. It will be my children. It will be my sons and my daughters and my family that I love. It will be who will be there with me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I just want to say it as I feel it. Inspiration of the Holy Ghost. I'm I'm not old. Let me just make that clear right now. I am 42. I think something like that now. And and let me just say this. There's there comes a point in your life. You're young and you're married and you have family and you have ambitions. You have dreams and all the things you want to do and all the things you're going to be and the kind of house you're going to build and and we did that. We went through all of that. What kind of car you're going to drive and and you know, you got all these dreams and aspirations as a man for his family and you you're young and you're married and and and and and I was at that point. I'm still young and I'm still married. &gt;&gt; Make that clear. But can I just say this? Something changed in my life. &gt;&gt; And I just want to say it to you the way I feel it from the core of my being. I I I'm thankful. I'm so thankful for all God has given me. I'm so thankful for the blessings he's poured upon my life. I'm so thankful for my house. I'm thankful for my cars. I'm thankful for my health. I'm thankful for all those things. But can I say that for my life, it is a very narrow goal. As David said, one thing have I desired in this life. And can I make it real simple? It's that my children walk in truth, serve the Lord, have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. There is nothing more important in your life. Oh, hallelujah. I say, God, do whatever you got to do to me. The Bible says, "No greater joy that I have than my children walk in truth." &gt;&gt; Make the rapture and let my children go with me. &gt;&gt; It's my greatest desire. You might want a lot of other things. That's all I want. What was it in Lot as a compromiser? He was Lot Abraham's nephew. His father died Abraham took him under his wings. They left their homeland. When God called Abraham to a new country, Lot walked in the light that shined from Abraham's faith. And because of that connection, he was blessed. His flocks grew, his herds grew, and multiplied. Prosperity followed. It came to such a place to where they they they they they they they had to separate themselves. Strife breaks out between his herdsmen and the cattle and and so Abraham's got to make a choice here and he gives he gives Lot the choice of the land. Gives him the choice and the scripture says Lot lifted up his eyes and he seen the well-watered plains of Jordan. He seen the wellwatered plains of Jordan. He lifted up his eyes. It was fertile. It was green. And here's Abraham and it's dusty and it's dirty and it's tent dwelling and tent living. It's poor. It's a hard life. &gt;&gt; And he looks at Sodom and he sees the well. He looks at Jordan and sees the well-watered plains of Jordan. It looked naturally to the natural light. It looked good. It looked pleasant. It was one for a tree to be desired. Come on, somebody. had good fruit on it. It looks good to him. And and he he looks there, but what he failed to see was a path from Jordan that led to Sodom. Prophet of God said he seen the wellwater plains of Jordan, but he didn't see the defilement of his daughters. &gt;&gt; He didn't see the destruction of his whole home. Prophet of God says in another place, Sarah, I'm sorry, uh uh Lot's wife, brother Mam says, Lot's wife started as an overcomer. Yes. &gt;&gt; But she just followed her husband's lead. &gt;&gt; A man who could never really take a stand for what's true. &gt;&gt; Thank God for men of God in my life that were not jellyfish. They knew what they were standing upon. They knew what they believed. They spoke it. You ought to thank God for a pastor who will speak the truth. &gt;&gt; She became a memorial of salt. Yeah, &gt;&gt; she became a a memorial. Brother Brandon preaches that in memorials, time tested memorials. She became a picture, a portrait of compromise of s a memorial. Oh, but there was another memorial. There was a memorial in Joshua 4 where the priests, the Bible says that they go across Jordan. I love how the Bible writes that and it says that they stood up, they they they he says they go into the Jordan and they place their feet, those priests stand there with their feet in the waters of Jordan. This is what your Bible says. And the I love how the scripture says this because it says it says that after they're there as the priests walk into Jordan, notice what is Jordan represent? Sin. It represents death, right? &gt;&gt; And so the the the these men of God had to put their foot. It's very different than than when Moses crosses the Red Sea. Now with Moses, it's a prophet and it's a, you know, almost you could say a dramatic picture, very dramatic with the staff in his hand and and he places his staff there and the David said the water stood up. It's like a big, you know, Hollywood film, you know, just a dramatic moment under a prophet. &gt;&gt; Somebody help me preach. But now they're at Jordan under Joshua. &gt;&gt; And Joshua doesn't call a prophet. He calls priests, one out of every tribe, men of God from the Levitical priesthood. And they come and God says, "You're going to have to cross a Jordan, too. You're going to have to cross death, too." &gt;&gt; And he says, "But it will be he'll be the priest." And he says, "When their foot touches the Jordan," now not when they thought about it. &gt;&gt; It's one thing to think about it. But you've got to place your foot in Jordan. &gt;&gt; And as they place their foot, Jordan parts a little bit. &gt;&gt; And here's Manasseh tribe representing Levi. And he places his foot. And then Gad, then Reuben, then Benjamin. And all of these men come and take their spot. And as they stand there, notice this, Jordan begins to part just a little bit. &gt;&gt; And now before you know it, there's a highway going through the middle of Jordan. And the families begin to walk through on dry ground. &gt;&gt; It's incredible because there's a memorial of stones there that God says, "Go and take the stones from where the priest beast stood firm, 12 stones." And he makes like like Lot's wife becomes a memorial. He makes a memorial and he says, "Let this memorial speak to your children &gt;&gt; when your children begin to ask fathers." Oh, can you hear the words of Malachi? When the children begin to ask fathers, the faith of the children will be turned back to the faith of fathers. &gt;&gt; And it will be these stones, these divinely revealed mystery truths will literally turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Pentecostal apostolic fathers. &gt;&gt; And he takes 12 men. Come here, guys. Give me six guys. Stand right here. I want you to I want you to Three of you to face this way. Three of you to face this this way. Come on, brothers. Come quick. Come quick. right there. Just face you. Face the three of you. Face that clock right there. Three of you face them. Just stand right in front of them. Let's make a prayer line right here. I need one more brave person. &gt;&gt; I want you to notice because these men are going to represent something. &gt;&gt; These men, listen to me, brother. Let me just say this to you today. It will be their stand, their firm stand, not a jellyfish, not a compromiser, not a, you know, not just somebody sort of halfway, don't really know what they believe, suspicious about things. As brother Brandham said, God will never use a man like that. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said in patriarch Abraham, he said, "If you're suspicious about believing and you got questions," he said, "I wouldn't even come up here in fool with an altar. I wouldn't even come through a prayer line if you got doubt in your heart. &gt;&gt; Get to the place where you can believe it. &gt;&gt; Then God will do something for you." &gt;&gt; And these men are going to stand upon. So, I want you to notice these men of God are going to go through things &gt;&gt; that you may never have to go through in your life. &gt;&gt; They will face doubt and discouragement. They'll go through sickness. They'll go through sorrow. They'll go through loss. You ought to pray for the men of God in your life and the pastors. God has sent you and your life to lead you and take a spiritual hand of faith and hold the sword of the word of God and stand against the demonic realms of darkness trying to trying to destroy your home and destroy your family and destroy your children. But thank God for a man who will say Satan, you have come thus far and thus far you will go no further. It will be these men who their stand on the word of God. The children of Israel will pass through. They will pass through the water. They will pass through on dry land because a priest is standing in his position. &gt;&gt; But I ask you, what would happen? What would happen if this brother's trial got him so down? Didn't have nobody to talk to. He was so discouraged. Little church ain't got many people. Can't hardly get nobody to come on a Wednesday night. Having to work a job, try to be a pastor. Listen, some of these men of God go through things that the I tell you what, they go through some of the hottest battles, things you'll never understand. &gt;&gt; But what if he let his circumstance, &gt;&gt; his own Listen, you think that your pastor doesn't have trials just like you've got trials? You think your pastor's family, his children will be attacked in a way your children are never attacked. &gt;&gt; They'll live under the pressure that you have no way to identify with. &gt;&gt; And now he lets his pain push him out of Jordan. Just stand there, brother. Stand there. What if this man over here gets bitter in his heart? Bitterness over somebody talked about him. Somebody said something about him. He says it online and then his entire ministry is you know questioned put into question and that thought begins to work through his mind and just thinks I just I just I just I just won't preach anymore and he steps out of the Jordan. What about this man if he starts saying, you know, we really don't have to quote a prophet anymore? You know, it's just we don't have to say brother Brandon said and brother Brandon said and brother Brandon said and brother Brandon said. Why we got to say that? &gt;&gt; Why can't we? You know, they have a problem talking about saying the Apostle Paul said. Don't have a problem saying the Apostle Peter said. Don't have a problem saying John Wesley said. Don't have a problem saying Spurgeon said, &gt;&gt; but somehow the problem is saying brother Brandham said. &gt;&gt; Tell you what, that's a spirit. And I ain't against the men. I'm against the devil. I hate his guts. He's my enemy. And I want to say I resist that devil with all that's in my heart. &gt;&gt; Oh, we ain't got to we ain't got to quote a prophet anymore. I ain't got to quote a prophet anymore. Don't you know that, brother Matt? That's what he told me. Brother Matt, come on. We ain't got to We got to keep saying, "Brother Brandon said, and brother Brandham said, and brother Brandham said, I mean, come on. Paul's, you know, aren't you not carnal?" One of apostles, one of Paul. And you know, why can't we just say Jesus said? Why can't we just go back to the B? Why can't we just go back to Jesus? Well, I got a good question. Which Jesus do you want? &gt;&gt; Paul said, I fear that you preach another Jesus. Preach another gospel, one who we didn't preach. &gt;&gt; There's only one thing and gospel that will keep Jordan and sin out of your family. &gt;&gt; Oh, we don't need to quote brother Brandham. Isn't that funny? Sorry, brother, to have you standing. Let me preach here for a moment. Isn't it funny they say don't quote brother Brandham yet? Yeah, they don't quote a prophet. Yet, I go in my Bible and I read that John the Baptist quoted a prophet. &gt;&gt; I find that Jesus quoted prophets &gt;&gt; for it that it might be fulfilled the word spoken by Isaiah the prophet that it might be fulfilled the word spoken by Isa by Hezekiah uh by Jeremiah the prophet that it might be fulfilled the word spoken by Malachi the prophet. Jesus quoted prophets. Paul quoted prophets. John quot of prophets. I think we ought to quote what a prophet spoke. And brother, I just want to tell you, I don't apologize for it. I don't try to water it down. I I believe it with all that's within me. &gt;&gt; It'll be a prophet's message that I am identified with. That's why Jesus said, "If they believe me, they'll believe. If they believe me, they believe the one who sent me. And if they believe you, they believe in me." Listen to it. Don't you know what the Bible says? He that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward. &gt;&gt; What was that reward? A great part of heaven. &gt;&gt; And we don't need to quote a prophet so he stands out. You know, I'm not so sure. That was brother Brandon's opinion. You know, we need to get back just to the Bible. We don't need to quote brother Brandon. Do you see what would happen? What is play tapes? &gt;&gt; You know, just push play, men of God. Put your iPad down. Put your Bible down. Stop preaching. Stop praying for inspiration. Stop waiting on the Lord for God to give you a word for the church that you're pastoring. You know, just let men of God. Don't you see what would happen if the devil had his way and men of God stop preaching the truth of this message? Jordan would flood your home. Sin would flood our worship. Sin would flood our youth. It flood our marriages. It would cover us. You ought to thank God for a pastor who will preach you the truth of the message of the hour and say, "Preach it, brother. Preach the truth. Don't back down. Don't compromise. I don't want a lie. I want an Abraham." Speak the word of God. Tell you what, I was in Be careful how I say this, but I was in a Central American country just last year. Brother Timothy and I was preaching there at multiple churches. Didn't know I the brother pastor never been before. He took me to church after church after church after church. God gave me something different for each one. And he's coming to the large city there. Wonderful pastor. He's going to be my interpreter that night. He had interpreted them for me. And so that morning, he wake he gets up. He says, "But Matt, I'm going to go to another church." I didn't know these churches. He didn't give me some intel report. Thank God no pastor does that. Brother Tim didn't tell me all y'all's problems and all y'all's issues. And did you, Brother Tim? No, we didn't do none of that. And he didn't say nothing. He just said, "We're going to go preach at this church here." And and and and he says, "Brother Matt, um you know, I'll pick you up at 3:00. He's a school teacher. He wakes up very early. Goes to work. He's pastor also. And he I'm waiting on the Lord all day just struggling. You know, it is sometimes, man, just struggling to you got so many things. Because the word of God is rich and deep. It's a bottomless well that we draw from. But you want something in season. &gt;&gt; Something that hits the target. &gt;&gt; And I'm praying, waiting, just struggling all day. And I and it picks picks me up. And we're driving and I'm getting more nervous. Lord, what am I going to preach to these people? And I'm just praying there in the car as he's driving. He says, "Brother Matt, do you know what you're going to preach on tonight?" I said, "No, brother." To be honest, I said, "I I'm still just waiting on the Lord." He said, "Okay, no problem, brother man." And right when I said that, the Lord just struck me with a sermon I had only preached, had not preached in a very long time. I preached a sermon called, "The truth shall make you free." And I said, "The sermon will be the truth shall make you free." That brother looked at me and he began to quote my John 16 uh that I have many things to say to you but you can't hear but he when he the spirit of truth comes he began to quote my opening scriptures. I thought, "What in the world? How does he know my opening scriptures?" And we just keep driving in awkward silence. And I get to that church and here's 300 people, believers, just a big old church. And what is one of the oldest churches there with the message, received the message back, I think it was the 8070s or ' 80s. And and and we go there and and I'm just waiting on the Lord and and and here we come. Here's the song. They're singing. And I walk out to that platform and I walk up and I open my Bible to John 16. And how be it when he the Spirit of truth comes, he will he'll he'll guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself. And and I could feel it. I could feel it as I was talking. This brother buddy, I was anointed. I don't even know what to call him. He was so on fire. It became at one point in that sermon, I I I started here. He was here. I was here like the interpreter and he was the preacher and he was preaching man. I mean he was just dynamic and I was thinking preach man you go and it was so powerful. He was just so inspired preaching that sermon. I got up in the middle of that sermon and I used that same exact example out of Joshua 4 and I used the priest and brought up six men and I said I want I said I want to use an example here and I said you brother come here and you brother come here and and you there in the back uh you two and you on the back wall caught a guy from the very back wall man big old long church I said you come here that'd be good and these six brothers come up and they make a foul line just like you brothers did and I start preaching I just what I just now did I put my hand over that brother I said what if this brother started saying we don't need to preach the message anymore more and we don't need to quote brother Brandham anymore. We're not going to quote him anymore. Yeah, he was a man of God. Yeah, he was a healer. But seventh angel, Malachi 4, I, you know, just got questioned, suspicious of it. Tell you what it is. They're ashamed of it. &gt;&gt; And they're ashamed to be identified. &gt;&gt; And I said, what would happen if they started, we don't need to quote the prophet anymore. We don't need to say, brother Brandham said, we just want Jesus. We're just going to go back to the Bible. And I I'll just tell you the message ain't for everybody. They go and say it. I'm trying to throw it, force it down somebody's throat. It ain't for everybody, but thank God it was for me. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. It was for me. &gt;&gt; And I began to preach that, buddy. When I preached that thought, Brother Joe, it was like a volcano erupted out of that church. They had sat quiet mostly, but all of a sudden, the bubble started flowing and people were shouting and rejoicing. I thought, man, it's like I hit a funny bone. What in the world? That church just exploded. People shouting. And at that part, I got out to the car and the pastor, I closed the door, his wife was just balling. And and brother, be careful not to say his name, but because he don't you you'll see why here in a moment. And he and he looks at me and he shuts the door and he says, "Now I can say it, brother Matt." He says, "Now I'm going to tell you what I didn't tell you what I was I determined in my heart not to tell you." And he says, "I woke up at 4:00 this morning and I asked God, God, give me I want to translate brother Matt good. Uh lead me to a sermon I could translate I could hear today while I'm at school so that I could translate him good." He said, "I went to your website. I scrolled through page after page. I randomly clicked the sermon you preached tonight." Hallelujah. He said, "Little did you know it, Brother Matt." And he said, "The pastor who has stood for this message for years has became old in his old age and he can't preach anymore." And he said, "Six brothers have been trying to turn this church out of the message. Started taking him down the route and saying we don't need to quote brother Brandham and we don't need to quote a prophet and we don't need to say brother Brandham said." He said, "Brother Matt, the spirit of God calls you to call all six of those men. God will back up his own word. This is not the message of a man. It is the message from the throne. Hallelujah. He wrote me back some months later. He wrote me wrote me on WhatsApp. I said, "Brother Matt, I got a testimony." He said that entire situation since you preached there turn around those those men are not in control. A pastor who is standing for the message is now in charge of that church. I say thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Lord. Because men of God are not a lot. They're not a jellyfish. Not a compromiser afraid to speak the word of God. Listen you you. There's only one thing that'll set people free. The truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you got to speak it with bare knuckles. Don't be afraid of men. Don't be afraid of brother big bucks that might leave your church. Preach the word of God. No matter what it feels like to other people. I say, preacher, preach it. How many do we have a church that'll say, "Preach the word of God. Preach it without fear." &gt;&gt; Where am I at? Lot could not separate himself. For some reason, there was a cord. But Sodom he couldn't break. His soul was grieved by the wickedness around him. But he stayed there. He built a home. He raised a family. And he sat in the gate, which means he was in a very important role. The prophet of God says became the mayor of that city and his wife followed, his children followed. He'd become comfortable in a place where sin was normal. And that's the tragedy of the legacy of Lot. Two nations will come out of you, Lot, Moab and Amnen. And little did you know, your decisions and choices, it wasn't the one big choice. Listen, it wasn't the one big choice that the devil get you to make. It's the little choices that you compromise. &gt;&gt; It's the little cho Just stay with me right here. I don't don't let me lose you right here. It's the little things that we allow. The prophet of God said, it's the little things we leave off. &gt;&gt; And he doesn't know that those decisions he's making, as the prophet says, he's seen the wellwater plains, but he didn't see the defilement of his family. He learned somehow to live at peace with what should have broken his heart. &gt;&gt; When judgment fell, angels had to take him by the hand to lead him out. His wife turned back looking for what she had left behind. Listen to what the prophet of God says here. Can I just go a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; Listen to what the prophet of God says here. I just want to read some of this as the Lord gave it to me. Now, Miss Lot, she didn't mean to do that. She went down there. She thought, "I'll just be sociable. It's all right. I'll just be sociable and become friends with them." You know, I I know they don't believe what I believe, but you know, and then I can dress in a certain way where they would never question. And, you know, I could just maybe maybe change my I don't have to be that, you know, that that weird or that odd or stand out that much. And then slowly that she just compromises more when she got gave God, brother Brandon says and when God gave her her last message of grace when he sent those angels down there and told them that within a few hours of Sodom and Gomorrah was going to be burned as she could not stand the thought of giving up her social life to come out into a desert lived like Sarah had lived out there in the desert have to wear common plain clothes of the women of the plain. She wanted to be in luxury. Her husband had become a great man in the city sat in the gate as a judge or mayor of the city. She wanted those luxuries. She could not stand the thought of having to give those things up. And as she went with her husband out of the city, she kept looking back, weeping and grieving because she had to give it up to separate herself from that type of death. She turned to a pillar of salt. She stands there to this day. It can be seen in the fields at the woman standing there with her head turned looking back. She's looking back over her left shoulder because her why her left shoulder is where her heart is. And brother Brandham says her heart was back there. &gt;&gt; You see, you can lead somebody out. You can take their body out. &gt;&gt; And many people with their body, they follow the message, but their heart is in a whole another place. &gt;&gt; In a marriage, long before that woman ever walks out, long before that man ever physically walks out, long before that, his heart walks out. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to somebody this morning. long before they leave the church and they leave the message and then suddenly their their own Facebook and their own, you know, Instagram and I could I couldn't believe it. I'm not not here in any way to judge the man, but he he he leaves and and I see someone's, you know, I'd seen a picture. Here he is and here's his daughters. Here was girls, lovely young ladies. And I I'm looking at that photo and here he is with a big proud look on his face and his daughter with half their body showing out to the entire world. &gt;&gt; I think to myself, this is what you want me to follow you out of. &gt;&gt; And and and the and the and let's go on. She looked back her heart brother says because she was forced to leave time test memorial 1957 she was forced. You can force someone to live this message. Oh, but there's a whole big difference, brother, when it comes from your heart &gt;&gt; and when your heart is, that's the problem we got. And I'll go ahead and tell you right now, the problem we have, most of the problem in this message is that our hearts were never turned back to the original apostolic faith. We got a lot of people to dress right, talk right, look right, have all the cliches, have all the the right sayings, and look all the part. But, brother, what they need is a baptism of the Holy Ghost that burns out the sin out of their life. and changes them to a new creature and their heart is turned back. &gt;&gt; Such a difference when you force someone to leave, but their heart is still there. Many people take Christ that way because they come out of the world felt like they were feel like they were forced to do it. They keep longing and lusting and isn't long till they're back there thinking of the leaks and the garlics and and you know and all those things that Egypt had. You know the problem with eating leaks and garlics is you can smell it on their breath. And I tell you what happens when you as a message believer start eating leaks and garlic. &gt;&gt; You stink. &gt;&gt; And you can't hide it. Their life begins to look a certain way. You drift. You start drifting. Your dress code changes. You You You look like a believer at church, but on vacation, what you post to the world, you're wearing shorts. You're got a sleeveless shirt on. You What happened? You mean your Christianity was only good in the home state where you live in front of? Listen, if that's the kind of gospel that that we believe that it just changes a, you know, reforms a man, puts a new, you know, new dress code. Listen, if this message ain't nothing more than a dress code, I promise your children will find a a dress code that's more appeasing to if it ain't nothing but rules and regulations. It's as if it's just a lifestyle. Oh, come on, church. It's got to be more than that. It's got to be a living reality. something that burns in your very soul. It's the passion of your life to serve God. Little did Lot know. You didn't know when you were leaving. You didn't know. You didn't see it. Did you see it, brother? Did you see it? It's amazing to me people want to come years later. I'm just going to preach because the inspiration of the Holy Ghost has me here. &gt;&gt; It's amazing how people want to come later after brother Brandham's gone and start questioning. &gt;&gt; And then you get people that'll believe Brother Google over everything and now they're believing chat GPT and and Gemini and whatever other uh AI you want to use and and just take it as the gospel truth and and just believe it just like it was said. Well, if Google said, "Oh, Chad GPD says it." Boy, that's even, you know, more authority. I'm going to tell you, we've received a more sure word of prophecy. &gt;&gt; We don't have just the ways of Christ. We don't just have the acts of Christ. We have the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says she knows what he wants done with his word. She has the mind. Uh here's the secret. The word is in the bride. and they want to come years later and question question him yet even when he was there. Can I read you brother? You have it there. Can I read you what some of his witnesses said while he was living? This is from Gordon Lindsay. He says, "Never, this is slide four, brother. If you have it, you can display it." He says, "Never had we known of any preacher calling death mutes and blind people to pray for and then to see those people delivered on the spot. a ministry that was beyond any that we had before witnessed. Listen to what this pre this man said here, James Morris. It was Brandham more than any of the evangelists who started the postw World War II fundamentalist healing revival following his counter with an angel on May 7th, 1946. Word radiated in every direction that all manner of diseases and afflictions were healed instantly by the little Indiana preacher. Even cases of raising the dead were published. Listen to what he says here. God has chosen servants. God chosen diverse and mysterious ways to reveal himself to servants, especially those called for dispensational purposes as was brother Brandham's call. In short, the man we know as William Brandham was sent to demonstrate God again in flesh. FF Bodler says when the gift is operating, brother Brandham is the most sensitive person to the presence and working of the Holy Spirit and the spiritualities of any person I have known. Morris Cerillo says God called this humble man, anointed his ministry to a degree that within a few short years his name was known in the most remote jungle outstation. Wherever you would go in the world, you would find the name of this messenger has preceded you. &gt;&gt; The full gospel men's voice says in Bible days, there were men of God who were prophets and seers. But in all those sacred records, none of these had a greater ministry than that of William Brandham, a prophet and seer of God whose photograph appears on the front cover of this issue of Full Gospel Men's Voice. Brandom has been used by God in the name of Jesus to raise the dead. Somehow we come &gt;&gt; years later. &gt;&gt; Somehow we come and we we start questioning. Listen, it'd be just like me with Mike Tyson. You know, Brother Ron, you know, Mike Tyson, you know what? If I came to you and said, you know, I hear all the stories, but I think I could have took Mike I know they talk about his jab and they talk about his right hand. They talk about all but you know, brother Ron, I don't think Mike was all what y'all hyping him up to be. I think I could got in the ring with him. You know, I think I could have done some damage. You know how dumb that would be? Might be a fatal mistake. You know what the problem with that is? Is we have his I won't call them opponents. I'll call them victims. &gt;&gt; We have his victims. And we've seen the knockout punch of Mike Tyson. You got to plan until you're punched in the face. &gt;&gt; We've seen his victims fall one after the next after the next after the next with one after the next after that. How dumb would it be? I guarantee you you brought any of those victims up here today and gave them the microphone, I guarantee you they'd tell you Mike Tyson had a punch like you never seen. Well, I got news for these uh for these people that has wanted to get up and question a prophet and question the miracles. Why don't you give cancer a microphone and put him up here? Put blind eyes behind the pull pit. Let him speak. And I tell you what he'd tell you. He'd say, "The same God that was in Jesus stood behind this platform." Hallelujah. And I got news. He ain't never lost a battle and he never will. &gt;&gt; Oh, give God a great big shout right there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Did you know it, Lot, when you left Abraham? Did you know what you were leaving? Yeah. You loved it when you came out of your sin and followed him all the way through. Did you know it, Lot, when you were leaving the Abrahamic ministry that you were leaving the angels more than an angel? Melazdc. You were leaving the ministry of Melazdc. And you also would receive an angel. Did you know it was those two angels that brother Brandon types with the ministry of Billy Graham and Oral Roberts, good men, brother Brandon said, Christian men, but he says their ministry was just like those angels to Sodom that blinded the people. &gt;&gt; Go read that in we just read it in Genesis. They they blinded the people. And brother Brandham says, "What does that blinding come from? Flashing red light." He says it's living off the glare of another age. &gt;&gt; To point to an I was but failed to see the I am. &gt;&gt; To point to a god of brother Brandham. Come on somebody. But fail to see Listen, people can point you to a prophet and what he did in the 60s. But what about that God? I I'm all for Revelations 10:7. But what about Revelations 8 through11? That thou must &gt;&gt; thou must prophesy. Listen, it ain't no choice, brother. I hope it falls on you like it fell on me. We ain't got a choice. The Bible says, "Thou must prophesy again." &gt;&gt; You must Did you Did you know, brother Billy Graham or Roberts, did you know those would be the angels that preached a Jesus loves you? Yes, I know. Four, three, you know, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John gospel and that was it. They believe the sessation that that the gifts and miracles stopped with the death of the last apostle. God, all that he spoke, he spoke and he has nothing else to say. All that he revealed is what he we have right here. Soloscriptor Torah is what they'll tell you that God is confined to this book. I'm so glad my God ain't got a chain or a collar around his neck. Chained to what men's imaginary God have created, but the God who spoke is still speaking. The God who was still is. and and and Billy Graham would come with that message to to to blind them and they would believe in other Jesus. Listen listen but but Billy Graham brother Adamson said was as tight as those Lot's angels that would go down to Sodom. Did you know it was Billy Graham's legacy that he would have a daughter named Anne? Her name Anne Graham. She'd marry a man with a last name that you probably never heard this one before. Lots lz. Go Google it if you want to. And Graham Lots. I don't think that's an accident because she's a preacher and she's got a website. You go to her website. You know what it's called? Lots angels. God don't do this on accident, friends. &gt;&gt; The ministry of Anne Graham Lots. &gt;&gt; I wonder if John, brother John, did you know brother John Ostein when you sat in brother Brandham's meetings and you sat there at the full gospel businessman's breakfast with Deeus Shakarion and here's Deeus who who stood with brother Brandham. Dimash Shakarian, you know, came there as a, you know, the fleeing refugee from the pograms, lands in California with Tatos. His greatgrandfather comes to California under the Isuza revival as attracted and magnetized to a ministry of the second pool, can see the discernment of hearts, can watch all of the miracles. The blind eyes and Deus wants to support that ministry as ministers breakfast invites men like like John Ostein. He's mentioned on tape. Brother Brandon mentions him. So good to see brother John Ostein here in the meetings. And Deeus Shicarian got to the point just like Deeus of Paul in the Bible where brother Brandon says Paul Deus looked at Paul's ministry and said you know what he's washed up. He ain't what he used to be. And Deus Shakarion closes the door walks away from brother Brandham. It was he was in that John was in that same group who could see the miracles. Even his wife healed of liver cancer, &gt;&gt; but could never come under the Abrahamic ministry. &gt;&gt; Graham 56 G r a h a m could could be identified under that man anointing but never could be identified with an eagle anointing. John Ostein, did you know that when you left the ministry of Abraham, this is what you would produce? Go ahead, brother. Did you know this would be your legacy? Did you know that that your weak stand on truth, your compromise to allow your wife to cut her hair, wear makeup, wear earrings? Did you know this is what you I'm not preaching against that man. He'll stand before the judgment seat of Christ just like all of us. Except I'm judged here, not there. &gt;&gt; Thank God. Some men's follow them. Sons go some sins some men's sins follow them. Some go before them. &gt;&gt; I'm glad my sins go before him. &gt;&gt; Did you know that when you left the ministry, John, this is what you produced? How about you, brother Deus? Did you know that your great great great grandchildren? &gt;&gt; Go Google this. &gt;&gt; Would be the Kardashians. &gt;&gt; Yep. Fact. &gt;&gt; Did you know what you were doing when you left the ministry of the son of man? Did you know? Did you see this? Did you calculate it? And I ask you the same question as I feel the uncction of the Holy Ghost. Do you know that when you leave this message, this is what you're going to the legacy of Lot, the legacy of compromise, the legacy, listen to what brother Brandham says here. Oh, but let me tell you about another legacy. I tell you what legacy I want to be identified with. Uh, go to the next slide. I've got a different legacy in my name. I got a different legacy and it ain't compromised. It's a man who stood for the word of God. Stood for the truth of the hour. Didn't back down to the voices of richness, the voices of money, the voice of popularity, the voice of women. He stood for the word of God. I tell you why there was a a Lot's wife, Brother Tim. Cuz there was a Lot. But I tell you why there was a Sarah. Cuz there was an Abraham. I tell you why there was a Rebecca. There was an Isaac. Thank God for Isaac. Thank God for Eleazar. You can be a Rebecca cuz you had an Ellie. Oh, give God a great big hand clap of praise. Hallelujah. You got to thank God for the men of God in your life and stand for the words. Come on, musicians. Come on musician. &gt;&gt; Thank what's your legacy brother Brandham? Because thou has chosen the narrow path harder way. Thou has walked in your own choosing. Thou has picked the correct and price precise decision and it's my way. because of this momentous decision. Slide 15. A huge huge Somebody say huge, huge portion of heaven will await thee. What a glorious decision thou has made. This in itself is that which will give and make come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine. Voice asked, "Would you like to see just beyond the curtain?" I answered it. It would it would help me so much. I think as I read those words, it helped Brother Brandham to go beyond the curtain, but it helped me so much. &gt;&gt; I've lost loved ones, too. And to know that they didn't just end their life with the last breath, but they're living more today than they were when they were here. &gt;&gt; Just beyond the last breath. Brother Brandham says just beyond this veil of flesh is a land where they're living real life. It's the continuation of this same life without sin. &gt;&gt; It would help me what happened. I cannot say this in body out or whether in translation I don't know is unlike any vision I've ever had. I could see the place to which I was taken. See myself laying back there upon my bed and I said this is a strange thing. There were great numbers of people that came running to greet me. Oh our precious brother. First came young women apparently in their early 20s as they would embrace me. They said our precious brother. Young men and the brilliance of young man who with eyes glistening. Listen to this. Stars of dark and night, white teeth. You might have been yellow here. They're white over there. White as pearls embraced me saying, "Our precious brother." &gt;&gt; Notice how they he meant so much to them. I noticed I two had become young again. I looked at myself there, turned and looked back at my old body laying on the bed with my hands behind my head. I said, "I don't understand this." Begin to try to comprehend the place where I was. As I began to realize that there was no yesterday, there was no tomorrow. No one seemed to get tired. As a multitude, the most beautiful young women I've ever seen threw their arms around me, I discovered there was only great love that overwhelmed me. No physical attraction is in the human behavior. I noticed these young women were all wore their hair down to their waistline. Their skirts went down to their feet. After this hope, my first wife hugged me, said, "My precious brother." Now, the young woman hugged me. Hope turned and hugged the young woman. I don't understand. There's something entirely different from our human love. But I don't want to go back to that old body on the bed. Oh, I can hear it calling me today. I can hear the heels of home and say, "I'm done with this natural life. I'm done with the sorrow and the trouble and the sadness and the tears. I'm ready to go to a place where there's no sickness. There's no death. There's no pain. But more than that, there's no sin." Boy spoke to me. He said, "This is what you preach that the Holy Ghost is. This is perfect love. Nothing can enter here without it." Taking up seated on a high place around our great numbers of men and women in the bloom of youth. They were crying with joy. Our precious brother, we're so happy to see you here. I thought, I'm not dreaming for I can see these people. I could see my body laying back there on the bed. The voice spoke to me. You know, it's written in the Bible that prophets were gathered with their people. I said, 'Yes, I remember that in scripture, but there are not this many Brandhams." The voice replied, "These are not Brandhams. These are your converts, the ones you have led to the Lord. Some of these women that you think are so young and beautiful were more than 90 years old when you led them to the Lord." I call that grace amazing grace. &gt;&gt; No wonder they're crying out, "My precious brother." Multitude cried and said, "If you hadn't gone forth with the gospel, we wouldn't be here." That's my thought. I want to end right here and say I want my children to look at me on that day and say daddy because you if you had not taken a stand for the word of God it was your stand and your conviction and your testimony that's why I'm here. I want to say to the men of God around the whole world. I want to say to these men of God right here, keep preaching it, brother. Keep preaching it. Keep standing upon it. Keep coming inspired. Keep preaching under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. We're going to go home one day. Hallelujah. Going to go home one day. You go home one day and all trouble. Bow your heads with me. All trouble will be gone. I asked Where's Jesus? I want to see him. People replied, "Oh, he's just a little higher. Someday he will come to you. You were sent as a leader. When God comes, he will judge you according to your teaching." I asked, "Does Paul and Peter have to stand this judgment also?" They answered, "Yes." I said, "I I've preached what they preached. I didn't divert from it to one side or the other. Were they baptized in Jesus' name? I did too. Where they taught the baptism in the Holy Spirit, I did too. Whatever they taught, I taught also. We know that the people cried. And we know that you're going back to earth with you some. And we're going back to earth with you sometime. Jesus will come and judge you according to the word you preached us. Then you will present us to him and all together we will go back to earth to live forever. I asked, "Do I have to go back to earth now?" They answered, "Yes." But here's the message. Keep pressing on. I began to move from that beautiful joyful place. As far as my eyes could see, people were coming to to me to embrace me saying, "My precious brother, my precious brother." Suddenly, I was back on the bed. I said, "Oh God," I wonder if this be your prayer today. You want to raise a hand and say, "Oh God, help me. Never let me compromise with the word. Let me stay straight on the word. I don't care what anyone else does, Lord. Let me press to that beautiful place. How many want it today? Want to press Lord? I want to press. I might have been on the sideline doubting and confused and suspicious of this. Today I want to let my faith rest on the only thing it can rest upon. It can't rest upon emotion. It can't rest, brother Adam said, on intellect. It's got to rest. It's faith has one resting place. That's the eternal word of God. And I want to say, Lord, let me rest my faith on that eternal word that changes not. I'm more convinced in my life that it will take perfect love to enter this place. There was no jealousy, no tiredness, no sickness, no old age, no death, only supreme beauty and joy. Whatever you do, whatever you do, hear the words of a vindicated prophet. Whatever you do, brother, whatever you do, sister, lay aside everything else until you get perfect love. Get to where you can love everybody, even every enemy. No matter if the plane is rocking, the lightning is flashing, the guns of the enemy are upon you. These things do no matter. These things don't matter. Get perfect love. And if you're not saved, accept Jesus as your savior right now. I I'd invite you to under the sound of my breath in this last service. If you don't know the Lord, you could know him today. If you've not been baptized, I'll give you the opportunity. Be baptized now. If you haven't received the second most important baptism, the baptism of the Holy Ghost, receive it now. And if you say, "God, I want to get I I have I've come that far, but I need to press to the place of perfect love. I want to say, Lord, let me press to that place where there's joy and beauty, a place, Lord, of perfect love. Grant it, Jesus, I pray. Grant it, Lord, to every life, to my home, to my family, to my children, Lord. Grant it, I pray. Leave us Lord with a legacy of faith, hope, love, belief.
