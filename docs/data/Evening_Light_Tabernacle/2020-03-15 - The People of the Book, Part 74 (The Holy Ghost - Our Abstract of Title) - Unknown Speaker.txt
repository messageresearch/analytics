No [Music] [Applause] ha my [Music] No [Music] ha [Music] [Applause] [Music] right [Music] a man is the king of kings and Lord of lords amen you know all the news is going home but this morning I was just thinking let's talk about Jesus let's think about Jesus all that he's done for us say man I believe he's greater than anything that's in this world any problem in a situation Amen let's just sing

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we want to go before the Lord in prayer this morning we're gonna remember the shut-ins different ones in the nursing home those that can't be here this morning when I continued a member brother Ron he's really battling weakness in his body trying to recover from the surgery all this going on amen my prayer has been that the Angels that ministered unto Elijah when he was in his moment of being down and weak remember the venom said that God called the angel with the Tinder's hands and said he they put spiritual vitamins and his food and I believe we served that kind of God he would he'd go on to say he said the same God who loved Elijah loves you a man and I believe that this morning so was asking the Lord to move in that situation also brother Donnie got sick last night while ministering it would had to be taken to the hospital they done all kind of tests so far haven't figured out an issue and so we want to remember him this morning it just looks like Satan's putting out his challenge but I believe there's a people here to accept the challenge a God here to accept the challenge a God and the people amen so when I remember these needs also when I remember brother Matt Dexter he's having bleeding with in his left I can hardly see out of it ask him for prayer this morning also sister Alicia Brown is from Missouri is asking for our church to pray for salvation of her husband Isaac and restoration of their marriage also sister sandy James is home having some issues sick this morning been battling on and off for a few months and also asked for prayer for a family friend who's in the hospital in serious condition sandy Barbour also a member Liz butts this morning she's having us she's sick at home also brother little Jackson ogres be sick this morning is way so how many one have a need you want to make it known to the Lord today amen it's just biting together as believers that's what believers do is believe and we believe this morning we believe enough to ask and we ask and believe we shall receive and so we want to come together and believe in today that what we asked we shall receive Amen also you know even our president today is you know it should today to be a National Day of Prayer people are turning to prayer and just you know all the chaos is going on what's going to be like when the bride leaves here we're seeing a glimpse of it people running over people over toilet paper and crazy stuff and it's just going to get worse and worse as things progress in the as far as a tribulation would come on into the world so I don't plan on being here amen I believe that there's a bride there's a people on this earth that's going to leave this place and then Satan will have his way but until then we'll ask God to move in situations you know I was talking to the Lord last night I said I said you know you see what's going on the climate it's in the world I said I don't know how many soldiers left to save but this is really hindering us as far as getting out we've already had meetings canceling the youth camp and the Philippines has been cancelled there's overseas you know it's locked down and things but I said God you got a way to reach that last one and if it is stopped the plague and so we continue the work however it is we just want to have faith that you know the what's going on and you know how to handle these things and so let's just go to him in prayer amen that God had just moved in the situation's around us amen the blood of Jesus would just cover amen the the needs of these that we've read today father Lord God were so thankful that we can rely on these words have faith in God we have faith in you today that you know all the things that are going on the situation's around us or the challenge that your enemy the old devil that all slicked serpent has made and he's made the challenge against the armies of the Living God but today Lord you're greater than the challenge you're greater than the enemy you're greater than the situation's globally Lord all around the world people are fleeing warn worrying and fear but Lord we have a comfort today nor do we have a shadow of the Almighty the wings that we could come under today the name of Jesus is higher than any name the name of Jesus is greater than any sickness and he's trouble in his situation father in his shortage Lord I was just thinking Lord in the times of shortage and a shortage in a famine Lord of what a woman took you at your word Lord and her Bell her barrel didn't run dryer all didn't run out you're that kind of God Lord we know that you can move in situations and and change lives and moments of times like these we just ask that you'd reach down and touch the hearts Lord the one sword that feels that fear coming upon them Lord may they reach back to the Word of God and find some comfort today we pray Lord a word that's not a word of historic history Lord but it's a word of today it's a word of comfort for today Lord and we can have faith in you to know that you'll fulfill your word Lord these needs that we read across this desk Lord that shut-ins Lord the ones that can't be here would love to be here father Lord that generals Lord in this army of God that Satan has come and attacked in their bodies nor do we stand against that thing in Jesus name Lord there's none greater than you Father you've heard the cry of the enemy the challenge of the enemy and Lord I believe the Holy Ghost is here to accept that challenge Lord just as he accepted it there that maniac would rush a platform and challenge a prophet of God but you said that the Spirit of God was there to accept it the enemy made the challenge but the Holy Ghost was there to accept the challenge and Lord just as that giant fell Lord we're looking but father into the supernatural realms and Lord we look beyond all the things around us all the fear and all the fear-mongering and all the things that's going on the empty shelves whatever father and we look to a god who's greater than any situation we look to the hills which come with our help our help cometh

into Everhart and dispel ever doubt and ever fear and cause us to believe Lord like never before we ask it in Jesus name Amen and amen god bless you and it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning where would we rather be a man I just saw a video clip sent to me from Germany a people just piled up I mean and I mean piled up just hundreds if not thousands that Audis waiting for the doors to open and trying to get into to get supplies and you know people are going crazy in these times amen but I'm glad to be serving a God who keeps us sane in this hour amen aren't you and then we thank the Lord for His goodness to us His grace and we I pray that the Lord will bless you wherever you from your gathered with us today many are gathered with us they're not missing their church service

we have a commission in this day in this hour to stand and this time also greetings to Cloverdale and we'll be streaming in from there as their services are canceled due to large numbers or been asked not to meet at this time so you know there's also different shut-ins like our brothers Stephen Frazier that's been coming he's not here this morning no where is he oh yes he's here god bless you I see her hand up there now but then he texts me there are emailed me the other day and said his body was down and and he was suffering from situations there but he was able to be with us in the service to the stream and so we're glad for that and every one of you that are assembled here are we glad that Jesus is here and man he said we're two or more gather in my name there I hear them in the mid and here we are today and we've sang the songs of Zion and worship the Lord and I I want us to sing a song just before we go I want us to sing a little bit at least a couple of verses of it is well with my soul but as you as we do I just thought about the wonderful song that sister Courtney sang you know she sang that some time ago and then but no did she write that yes she did write that okay was the songs then from her heart it just shows what an anchor we have in times of trouble and then we have an anchor that no matter what's going on and it's going home time it may be trouble in the land but it's going home time and then we got to realize that we in this time it's important to make your calling and election sure a man be stable be steady be steadfast in the truth and the faith during this time and then then of course brother Philip singing yeah he knows he knows how to testify of what God can do - for an unsaved husband and bring him back to the Lord what a grace of God what is mercy and His mercy I reach out for your need this morning because he's a merciful God who cares mm but I thought my goodness what a wonderful Pentecost was song that we as the real true Pentecostals can sing and worship our Lord Jesus man and declare His goodness in this day in this time we can hold to God's unchanging hand no matter what the trouble is and man what the situations are we can remain steady under the pressure amen give me that first verse when peace [Music] [Applause] [Music] you say [Music] my soul [Music] my [Music] later should [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] [Music]

[Applause] my soul hallelujah let's turn to Psalms 91 we're going to read from the first verse and they're good to be in the house of the Lord now and feeling his presence among us we want him just to speak to us through his word amen you can walk okay praise the Lord Timothy who got hurt on the job this week brother John fluid called me and said how go to prayer said he said yeah I asked him did we want him to pray and he said immediately his foot started returning better and here he is today well and we thank God for that what a great God that is amen thank you lord Psalm 91 in verse one he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of my of the Lord he is my refuge in my fortress my god in whom in him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the Fowler and from the noisome pestilence he will cover thee with his feathers and with the with his wings shalt thou trust under his wings shalt I trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday a Thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee only with our eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made the Lord which is my refuge even the Most High God the habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge nobody to keep thee in all thy ways Amen may God bless you as you are seated we're gonna be speaking today on the Holy Ghost our abstract of title and I have but just a few comments to make before that we go into the message some things that the Lord has dealt with me and of course some things also that are happening transpiring in our nation in the world as we speak I just got a text from brother sergei volkov in moscow russia and he he sent me some pictures of photographs of the stores in the United States where the shelves are bare and and of course a lot of you probably know of the hysteria that's going on in the United States now and and not only that but different parts of the world even our governor John bel Edwards signed the proclamation this week among other actions that halts the gatherings of more than 250 people until April the 15th or the 13th is he closed to all the public schools statewide effective Monday March the 16th resuming on Monday April the 13th as Louisiana seeks to slow the spread of the cove at 19 in the state as midday Friday or as of today really Louisiana has 77 positive cases with one death already a lot of people and are asking us about the Louisiana youth camp which is planned April 12th weekend starting on Thursday through Sunday and as of today is still planned the Dry Creek Campground officials have asked us to wait until tomorrow to make a decision until they can find out get a handle on the situation a little bit better and of course you know there's a little bit of concern as as there's talk about stopping state to state travel so we don't know what is all is going on I I just wanted to say a few words about it this morning because some already avant made this out to be the squeeze and you know to close our churches or cancel a meeting would be like giving in to the council of churches well this is not a squeeze on religious this bands government meetings and political rallies and ball games and sporting events and all kinds of events and they they all they've also said they won't be coming around in to our churches counting and making sure we don't have over 250 so you know don't don't worry about coming and gathering with us you won't be arrested we've got a police over here he's not here to arrest us he's here to enjoy the service but um this is not the persecution nor is it the tribulation plagues some are saying well we got to have persecution for there to be rapture and faith and because of the lack of that the rapture the body changes not imminent well that's not true you see this message is rapture and faith and if perfection would come by persecution than to church and the Dark Ages would have been raptured but persecution doesn't perfect with the church the blood of Jesus does and of course we should use precautions and certainly respect one another there are many whose immune systems are weak or compromised and I'm just gonna leave it up to your discretion as to whether you want to come to church or stream that's all up to you we're not canceling church but I do encourage you if you're sick don't expose it to others so some churches are even encouraging that they're people not shake hands at this time and there again I'll a leave that to your discretion as far as food shortages it's always wise to have a Orsola supplies on hand that's true whether it's tornado city it sees them snow season or whatever you know there's we know there's been a run on meet and shortages of toilet paper you figure that one out and him sanitizers because of hoarding it's fear that causes this and and I just want to go ahead and say I'm definitely not infinite and all-knowing but I'll tell you what is clear to me what is clear to me is the rapture has not happened and we may be in processes I bet they're not certainly believe in the shout and the voice and the different aspects of it but the consummation has not happened and so the tribulation is not own and the plagues are not falling and this is not the squeeze and the squeeze that the people or I've looked for it happens in the tribulation I just tell you I'm coming up this week I woke suddenly in the night must have been about 3:00 in the morning I didn't really look at the time but I'm with jugs I hadn't been asleep for a little while and I woke up wide awake and I was laying there thinking and going over my mind about thee about the seven trumpets and I was just kind of going and rehearsing them in my mind is it's kind of unusual you know you just wake up and that's your what you're thinking about and few nights later I had a dream where that I was asked to speak on the trumpets look like some new believers there or something and I I I so they were asking me would I speak about the trumpets and I just you know in my dream I just said well all I know about them is that they are for Israel and not for the Bride of Christ and so I went and reviewed and studied again the Feast of the trumpets just to go over them again and I just want to tell you brother branham makes it clear in the feast of the trumpet that the bride receives her squeeze in an ecclesiastical manner while it is Israel who receives it in a physical manner so the church will go through that time of tribulation but not the bride's you will be raptured before that time and the ecclesiastical squeeze that we are facing is um you know it's just it is band the anointing is band all the gifts of the Spirit is band even speaking in tongues which is the least of the gifts band divine healing and prayer lines and altar calls and worship a man and that's the virus we need to be concerned about and then people are concerning and panicking about the groan of hours but spiritual death is going to the land and most are unconcerned about it and throughout history let me tell you there have been downturns in the economy there's been hard times however I'm just - for those of you that are worried about hard times and difficult times let me remind you this last age is has been spoken of in the scripture to be rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing so the last days is characterized as Noah's day of eating and drinking marriage and given in marriage and life you are known as usual and it is also characterized as it were in the days of Sodom that life is going on as usual until the climate he strikes and which would be the destruction the fire falling in the fact here in church age brother Branham talks about our burden that we face and this will be our burden I want you to just to remember what our real burden is what we're going to be faced with what what we what is the greatest threat in our day for this age and he says in the theater in churches he quotes the scripture I'll put no upon you none other burden the word for burden is weight or pressure the pressure of the Dark Ages was either bend or be broken bow or die it was the Inquisition the power of the Empire backing up satanic worship be organized or pay with your life each age had its pressures for example a great burden of the last age is the pressure of riches soft living and nervous tensions in a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in before they seems to have a clear-cut burden it was to defy Rome and stand up for the word even to death but again our age the pressure this age is richest self living and nervous tensions in a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in so I want you to realize this is where our greatest danger comes from and and of course it is the lukewarmness of this age that tries to come into every life into every home every person every church and and there but there historically there have has always been and always will be persecutions most fiercely and physically against the bride the elect of God historically this is true and it will continue to be true but a wholesale persecution we're not looking for that see those ideas which brother branham said the Pentecostals were looking for where the church is persecuted for its perfection and in response does great signs and wonders happens in the tribulation under Moses and Elijah the two witnesses it is to Israel but if you'll follow closely and see the junction there was a major corner a turning of a corner and brought balance ministry and this in his understanding in his revelation and disjunction happens at the when he preaches the Feast of the trumpets and he was to preach the seven trumpets going to take seven different services and try to preach them and he couldn't get the facilities and so on and on and and he went back to prayer and it was revealed to him that the trumpets are for Israel and not for the bride so from their own brother branham sees the bride receiving her persecution in a an ecclesiastical manner in other words a persecution that comes against the Word of God and and while the Jews their counterpart our counterpart receives the in a physical manner so before this important division the distinction is made brother Branham makes many statements about an coming persecution and our squeeze and so on like that but you know he was like Joshua was before the borders of Israel were defined and you know but then God God defines the borders and he says now let he saw have their portion mohab have theirs and let the and then he defines Israel's borders I'd like you to turn with me for this to do to Romany two and verse four if you will and command out the people saying you're to pass through the coasts of your brethren to children of Esau which dwell and seer and they shall be afraid of you taking good heed unto yourself therefore metal not with them for I will not give you of their land no not so much as a foot breath because I have given Mount Seir unto Esau for possession then you look down at verse nine and the Lord said unto me distress not the Moabites neither continue them in battle well I will not give you their land for a possession because I have given air unto the children of lot for a possession so you can see here there are different portions that are given and and Israel was told now don't try to take what belongs to Esau and don't try to take what belongs to Moab I've actually given them that portion if you look in the book of Revelation there is a great number that come up out of Great Tribulation a multitude without number and this is a church this is not our portion and then the bride leaves before the tribulation comes in and then you got the 144,000 and and their inheritance that is not a portion we're not trying to God will not give us not one foot breadth in that land of theirs it is their land it is their promised land but for us you see our joshua has done the same thing you know and he says now here's the bride's portion here's the church's portion and here's 144,000 portion and we are not to try to take what is allotted to another are you with me so now it was very important that these things be defined for us for example if the visa if the seven trumpets were not defined for us as to who they were far we would be expecting to fulfill that but because they define for us who that they are far then we don't have to worry about that portion God's not going to give us that portion so in the Feast of Trumpets brother Branham said now here is the calling out time at the sixth seal one is open to persecution struck the Jews in the literal standpoint and here comes a persecution to the church in the ecclesiastical standpoint because the bride has already called the Sabbath's are over and ready for the Jews to be called wear to the feast of atone though Church don't you see that call to the feast of atonement to recognize your tomb it not no more as chickens and geese and what they've been doing but the Lamb of God slain from the foundation of the world and Israel's gone to know that and then again there in recognizing your day in his message which comes right on the next Sunday after they feast the trumpets that brother Branham preaches he said I'm gonna say something not national force but Israel in her homeland national force will put the church in the World Council of Churches but the power God will put people in the bride the world forces this way and the world forces that way but God forces upward and the Spirit of God which is the Word of God my word of spirit in life will put the bride in her place Amen cuz she will recognize her position in the word then she's in Christ we'll put her in her place no national force will do it but the national force did drive Israel to their homeland then national forces of the Council of Churches will drive every organization into it but the power of God will raise the bride in the glory out of it man I still believe there's to be a people who will escape the things that are coming on the earth a man again and Feast of Trumpets brother Branham talks about this he says I'm you know how what is it done in the cunningness as he said he coming with flatteries what's he done bringing the Protestant promised an ecumenical council of the world churches a spirit of Antichrist among both of them bringing them to the slaughter just like they did the other in the hour to call the bride how loosed of all in the ecclesiastical spirit loosed upon what not upon the denominations but upon the bride and here you'll get it the bride will not go through that time the Bible says not the church will but not the bride can't you see ministers can't you see that rather you say the church has to go to the persecution for the perfection of it he says the blood of Jesus Christ perfects the bride a man who chooses a wife don't put her through a lot of punishment she's found grace to with her and she's found grace with him and he engages to her and if there's anything he'll keep her from every place to turn her hand His grace is so great about them a man now let me just talk about this for a moment don't think we're exempt from flu or viruses or diseases our cancers or troubles or anything we're still human however if we get them I just want to tell you is not something from God he said I'll put none of these diseases among you upon you brother Branham too connected the tightening of the skin and the squeeze to the third pole which was the coming of the word in here and he says what's the third pulled in but and there's a direct connection between the two the squeeze in the third pull but the squeeze isn't natural then that demon powers are loosed upon the bride in the in the spiritual ecclesiastical round and the physical persecution of worldwide plagues and diseases and tribulation falls after the bride is taken away so the whole world is going to right now financial physical emotional stress due to the coronavirus and I just say we're not immune to any of that the plague that the that the bride is immune from is spiritual death let me say it again you know the world is going through financial physical and emotional stress due to the coronavirus and we're not immune to any of it you have downturns and economies you have stock market crisis you lose money here you do your business doesn't do well this year we're not immune from trouble we're not immune from diseases don't think don't go to thinking that you know we're just saying we got we're immune when it won't touch us the plague that the bride is immune from is spiritual death amount and those demon powers will oppose the anointing all the gifts of the Spirit divine healing prayer lines altar calls worship the persecution of the squeeze will be against us word for this age that's why brother Branham said we we need a spiritual awakening to to discernment and light of the last plague we've got to realize you know what what is our real serious threat and our real serious threat is not this coronavirus it is that Laodicean spirit of death that is coming in the last day that makes people lukewarm cold and powerless and that attacks the anointing and the moving of the Spirit and the worship of God and the Holy Ghost being free to move into church and so I want you to understand that we we must accept all the Word of God we will not be compelled to give up our full inheritance amongst we are the anointed one for this day and for this reason we have come and man and so now as we are speaking about that this morning I want to just draw your attention back to the subject that we have been talking about and that is about the about the the abstract of the title deed is heaven has moved in our generation as the lamb takes the book had to loose the seals and then they give that book of inheritance back to the believer which means that we're going to someone in this generation I believe it is you and me with all my heart I believe we're the generation that is going to walk into the full inheritance in other words everything that Adam lost we will regain first by the change of our bodies from mortal back to immortality now this has typed out in many many of the scriptures and of course it is shown in the book of Revelation that we have been through as a book that was sealed and nobody could look upon it until a man was declared worthy to take the book and to loose the seals and by loosen the seals he was removing the claims that was keeping the book from being open and these these had been had been sealed down to the ages by the spirit of the Antichrist that it sealed the truth of the word away from us but it is being opened here in this last day when we come back to the gospel that Paul preached now in the Old Testament there are many many types that types our age and this all we can do is look back and we can see what God's done in the past and we can see as in the shadow that is created or what is coming what is coming from the from the dead from the negative to the positive now in the Old Testament there was two major crops that came to harvest there would be the barley would ripen first around the Passover season and then the wheat harvest would be some fifty days later at Pentecost and before they can begin the harvest and eat of its bounty the Israel would take the first ripened grains and bring them before the priests to offer to God the first fruits of the harvest as a wave offering before God and that was actually me to wavings of the sheaf one would be for the barley season and happens the day after the Passover that correspondent exactly with the same time of Jesus resurrection but while the high priest was waving the barley grain offering Jesus appears at the tomb as seen by the disciples and he was the first of the resurrection for he was the first from among the dead and and of course with him came the Old Testament Saints which we'll read about in a moment then there would be seven weeks that would follow the Passover these seven weeks would be called the feast of weeks and the Pentecost seven weeks later on the fiftieth day was the waving of the sheaf marking the beginning of the wheat harvest now on the on that same day the Holy Ghost fell and it came with the sound of a rushing mighty wind and tongues of fire came upon 120 as the Holy Spirit was waved over the people when the day of Pentecost was fully come we noticed that the deer two distinct crops ripen at two distinct times the Old Testament Saints they have already been harvested right a man though wheat harvest comes seven weeks or seven Church ages later and it is time for the harvest of all the ages hallelujah hey man so the chief was Christ the firstfruits of the resurrection he really even was rose again and was waved over the people and proved that he was not dead but he is alive forevermore and the Old Testament Saints were harvested with him and rose from the dead with him Matthew 27 52 and the graves were open and many of the bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and a peered unto me so you see he was the first to rise but when he rose they rose with him because it was the beginning of the harvest the barley harvest are the harvests of the Old Testament Saints and they they were typed by that barley harvest now again this chief wavin happened on Sunday it would be the first day of the week and this would mark then the beginning of the countdown to Pentecost so it would actually begin a countdown from the time of Jesus resurrection to the day of Pentecost which would be seven weeks under Pentecost now again they would also fulfill another type and looking at the type and looking at the types this morning I want to just say again the barley harvest is over with and the first fruit was accepted and the Old Testament Saints rose and the countdown began and it began with Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira Sardis Philadelphia and Laodicea seven church ages a man representing the seven weeks but at the finishing of the week the day of Pentecost fully comes are you with me now brother Branham spoke about another Shifa waving here at the end time and I just want to go over them and I'm just going to take snippets from it is the rising of the Sun as he talks about it he says and it's to be waved again if we realize in the last day according to st. Luke 1730 which you know was as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the and the revealing of the Son of Man so again we're here in the days just before the burning of the earth right where the bow before the fire falls but before he comes there's to be a safeway and that sheaf wave is the revealing when the son of man the word is revealed again made known to the people but it's more than just a revealing of the word and the knowledge of the message it is absolutely the taking on flesh in a people because remember this is Pentecost if it's pretty cost is where the word is written in the nature of the people it's not a collection of books it's not an external religion it's not saying well we got the word and but the word is a person and that person comes in you and the person of the Holy Ghost and it comes in your life and you become a sheep wave before the world that Jesus Christ lives hallelujah dizzi this is what Philip would stand up there this morning and say listen you got a lost husband out there but here I am a pressed fruit hey man I'm the one of the first one of the first fruits right here and I'm suing you that God can save a lost husband and we're waving it before the world that the prodigal will come home hallelujah are you with me remember is a way before the world that God can take a man or a woman that's lust and sin and turn their lives around and wave them in their community amen show in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] brother branham would top this and he would use this terminology now we know he 2,000 years ago it was the groom coming to Christ and we're not looking for Jesus to come walking down among us when taking a seat in our pews or walking beside us on some dusty road or a man dressed in sandals and and walking among us like that no we we we meet him in the air in this coming a man is more of a going away than it is a coming though it is a coming because we meet halfway like Isaac met Rebecca in the field and then took her to her home so God meets us here Jesus meets us here and so it again it is the coming of the Lord but I want you to understand it's more than the coming of the physical man Jesus it is in brother branham's terminology in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church and the last day there's to be a sheaf waved again in the last days and then he says and for the first time that will come forth for the bride aids for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back in power and it's being waved over the people by the same signs of wonders that he did back there the word which he was was way back to them on the day of Pentecost the word made manifest so brother Branham again says but in the bride age right here in this last date in the bride coming of Christ cuz he came as groom 2,000 years ago but how he's coming in this ages first he'll be manifested in bride form it is fullness in a mature form for the marriage of the lamb has come and you don't marry an infant but a mature elect lady that's why I was preaching about adoption last Sunday because this is a mature age it is a maturing message it is a perfecting message it is an adopting message it is placing you in the body of Christ a man as with a party with power and that's what I would you to understand this message does for you it places you in a position of power or pain a position of authority a man that said tells you Satan is under your feet whatever you bind I'll bind it whatever you lose I'll loose and then you use my name come on man whatever you ask in my name I'll do it what is it it's the son acting in the father's name and that's what happens in the procurement of Christ it ALS power is more power it's the same Jesus and a multiplied form are you with me now then he would say and now as I say I'm just reading these snippets and now as I say it's to be waved again at the last day so we let me just go back over some of these it's me waved again we realized in the last days according to Luke 1730 in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church to me as she waved again in the last days then he says for the bride age for resurrection out of dock denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word is turned back and its full power and it's being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there the word which he was whose way back to them on the day of Pentecost the word made manifest and now I say it is to be waved again in the last day so now how can there be the waving of the sheath unless we are at the harvest of our harvest come on how can there be a waving of the sheath if this is not an appealing cost and then so then the day of Pentecost had fully come it is building types before us typed out there on Mount Sinai 50 days after the Passover and the log comes down and written upon stone it would be typed out again 50 days after the Passover there the Holy Spirit come to write the word of hearts but there comes a time where it's no more the type anymore are you with me and man the day of Pentecost had fully come and it must be the Pentecost of all Pentecost a man it must be the jubilee of all Jubilees then this requires that the leaves are the debts on the book be paid so that every slave can go free and this requires that the lamb began to take the book and loose the seals and remove the lanes or remove the debts remove the things that kept us from going than the complete Liberty remember it could not eat and nobody could go into liberty until the day of the Jubilee and then so I ever dad if you went into that you sold your property it was it was sold until the day of Jubilee so if you're thirty years and to that fiftieth year then it's only 20 years that it's in that it's in a kept in and so you know but when it's chilly then it is time that everything go free hallelujah hey man do you realize them the things that you have been looking for you here in that day in time where the jubilee trumpet is sounding saying that you can have salvation not just a little bit like Luther had or sanctification like Wesley had become like Pentecost had but the fullness of the Holy Ghost returned back in the fullness of its power and then because why with the word comes and experience with the word comes up power remember this when you come back to true doctor you come back to the same doctrine of Jesus and when Jesus doctored it always was accompanied with signs and wonders never speak a man like this man I never have we heard a word like this never has what manner where is this for he speaks not as a scribe not as a theologian come on now the message wouldn't come to make us theologians the message was come to give us a power for the words he speaks with authority but with authority he commands his spirits and they obey Him sickness and disease are septic to him hey man if that was done in the groom what must be done in the bride because there's some be a chief wait come on in the entire so this requires it as I was saying that the lens of the debts on the book be paid and every slave can go free every land that has been held in bondage whether it's the land of healing the land of miracles the land of signs and wonders the land of predestination the land of eternal security the land whatever it is whatever part every portion is released when the book is open it's all released this is why brother Branham would tell us in the Feast of Trumpets said the nomination that's bound that movement of the Holy Spirit for these two thousand years but it's being unloose it's being released by the entire message hallelujah when we preach this message in the right way he'll release healing to you it'll release deliverance to you he'll release salvation to your loved ones it won't take it away and I release it now this is a fulfillment of all types let's just talk about it for a minute the feast of unleavened bread was seven days without leaven this would type seven Church ages where we worked have been fed the pure Word of God is again that Passover that the blood must be applied the token which is the Holy Ghost it is the Jubilee wherever slave can go free it is the last of the seven weeks of the feast of weeks the heart of the barley harvest of the Old Testament was finished and here 728 in his lair the harvest begins as a sheath is weighed now following the pattern it's not just going to bring a resurrection out of dark denominationalism back to the word again but it's going to do more than that it's going to raise the dead of seven ages this is the complete Jubilee that those who are just assets or just crumbs and you can't even find a microscope of their body worth it doesn't matter he'll create again and they'll stand again from the seven Asia Europe a match to believe things that is more than you feel on a cancer just more than healing a heart trouble you have been asked to believe that God in our generation will take an old man or woman and restore him back to youth again take the dead have a seven ages that rise him again change to the moment in a twinkling of an eye the bride will be waved as the first-fruit the bride aged for the resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message this is a jubilee message and the jubilee message says that the form maturity of the word what's adoption for maturity that's what adoption is full maturity the full minority of the word has turned again in this full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there so again those that are resurrected out of the dock denominationalism they will be way that as as a sheep that the phone the journey of the word listen it's a message are you with me you want to thank a message you want to think 1100 tapes you want to think a bunch of books you want to think about a bunch of writings that's not the message you are the message are you hearing me that's not the word you are the word in all reality this Bible is not the word you are the word a manual this is on print the Word of God but you are in flesh that word a God and God adds his word to be on flesh and our day an hour why a pinnacle it was not written in stone it was written in the heart it was a change in nature and this bride is a freshman it's the first ones that broke off the yoke of Luther Wesley Pentecost Catholicism all the twos come on among all the tombs you broke three of them hallelujah and you're you're not dead I mean some of your after like your dad but I'm reminded I mean you've got the keys to hell in the death you got the keys or Satan's Eden you got the keys all this hell around us you got the key a promise to walk into your victory because you have risen with him and it's waved in the people with the same signs and wonders he did back there forget about forget about impersonating a prophet forget about oh brother damn you you're trying to you're trying to take brother branham's place and you're having prayer line you're trying to take this one forget about taking his place man way I'm not even worried about taking his place I'm looking back to to jump 1412 the works that I do shall you do also greater than these how you do I'm looking back to March 16 back these signs shall follow them that believe hands on the sick and they shall recover [Applause] fast I say let us be the same Christ that went down 2,000 years ago and fire and not bring that same Christ into your life and fire again triumphs again go show my disciples I'm not a dead Creed but I'm alive oh my this is a message and the message is the word that's back in his full power the message is it has everything it always had if it had tongues in has tongues now head sides in have signs now had miracles there that has miracles now s-phase lives then have saved lives now it's the rising of the Sun it's the dispelling of darkness brother Branham would say of this quoting the scripture because I live you live also speak into his wife there again not it's not about mimicking or impersonate you know or you know that down that's his job I don't want to take brother branham's job I'll never try to be the seventh messenger neither should you hey man but we can't be Jesus who is greater than the seventh messenger come on amen because I live you live also speaking his wife because I live you live on so what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to me to be a little in Christ Jesus but God's quickening power he was waved to them the word which he was he was waved to the back to them on the day of Pentecost the word made manifest and now I say it's to be a wave again in this last day we have an abstract of title that has given us an open book what was closed what had been hidden what was veiled from other ages is now open to us the land is yours hello the Covenant is the deed to it but the enemy that possesses it and his claims to you must be stricken off now I want to bring this down forever believer today forever believer they receive the word of promise of and ahead of an inheritance but then every claim against you as a believer must be stricken off I want to say that you must have more than a deed anyone can pick up a Bible and say I have a title amen these promises are mine but you as an individual must have the Holy Spirit which is the abstract of title and he is the guarantee of your rights to every promise now an abstract of title is where the deed has been searched and all claims against it has been settled and that's what the Holy Ghost when he does it does when he comes to your life he comes down and he searches out everything in your life and he clears out the deed all the claims come on somebody all the claims that the devil had against you your past a man your habits the world said every claim the devil had on you when the Holy Ghost comes he cancels to death he pays the death and he gives you an abstract he gives you a seal saying I have examined the title and I've been Savin his title and his title is clear his name is hallelujah they are heir to every promise and the Holy Ghost is the abstract that clears your deed that white so in your past that cleanses you of ever false doctrine of everything that was hold you back has been cleared by the blood of the Lamb [Applause] every man was born in sin Satan that claims against him but when they believed the Lord and believed on him they had the deed but when they received the Holy Ghost it was the abstract to the deed showing that everything against him is struck off would like to just share with you some of this from the Easter seal and bear with me as we go through this but he said when they went up to Pentecost there they received the quickening power the power that made them alive now that's where I think you Presbyterian and Methodist brothers you do receive potentially on believing on the Lord Jesus Christ but the abstract hasn't come yet that's the clearing of the deed God gave Abraham a promise and abraham believed god it was imputed in him righteousness but he's he sealed the Covenant by the seal of circumcision and God gives you a promise potentially that you will receive it that you're going to be you're going to be raised up and this body is going to be glorified we at the end time but you see you have to get a clearance on that D and the clearance is when everything against it is struck off a man and you've got the abstract to us you've got the seal that is yours everything all that belongs to you and when we believe on Jesus Christ our Savior and repent in are baptized and come up to believe him God recognizes I repentance and our faith toward him and since down the abstract and the abstract is the assurance it is a guarantee that everything that was ever held against you you've thoroughly repented hallelujah and the property is button and you hold the abstract for the assurance let somebody then try to put you off the land and say he behold you have the abstract in your hand Lane trying to attain a law in the land that can do it because you hold the abstract and there's no devil no church in its theology can ever overstep the boundaries of God's proof of abstract that the baptism of the holy ghost has recognized us in Jesus Christ and we're sure to raise as he raised because potentially we're already raised with him in the old things what does it do to your mortal bodies it turns our opinion it changes our no sense it sets our affections on things that are above and the smokin the drinkin the gamblin the things you used to do is dead and it's beneath you and you are quickened and this quickening power brings your body into a raptured condition in other words it cleanses you from sin and you're ready for the rapture oh man I want you to know by the coming of the Holy Ghost in your life the token it made you rapture we don't have to do a week's fair meeting to be ready because Kovac 19 is in the air the Holy Ghost is only sealed us to the day of redemption hallelujah a man if we tell who we are oh he said there on the day of Pentecost when those group in ik also group up there on the day of Pentecost received their abstract deed it glorified their souls they screamed they saw tongues of fire separated upon each of them and it's so quick in their body till they couldn't even speak in an earthly language anymore it quicken their body to a heavenly language the place that they're going to the quickening power shut their mortal bodies so that their entire mortal language was transfigured or transformed into a immortal language what a quickening power a man something that belongs and if the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in your mortal body it's also quicken your mortal bodies we are quicken them by the power of the Living God tongues or we don't want them today but comes quicken to a heavenly language to speak to them a rapture enough hallelujah raising up and to a different atmosphere than what they never lived in you know what happened to you when the Holy Ghost came it wraps your due up into a dimension that you had never lived in before hallelujah an atmosphere that you have never ever lived in before and with the new quickening light to them that come endemic quicken their language they spoke and new toes oh yes now watch there it's also designed to give them after this aspect is designed to give them every promise that it's on the grounds and that its design the coming of the holding us gives you access to every promise on the grounds and man every promise of the grounds of God's Word that's promised in the Bible that quickening power was given to them to quicken that promise to them therefore they laid hands on the sick and they were healed they spoke in new tongues they've done great signs and wonders because that was in God's promise and when Jesus died to redeem that back to them the grounds that belonged to the sons of God he demonstrated what God was Jesus demonstrated the grounds we are welcome there ought to be a church that rises and say we're going to do what Jesus did I minded Jesus cast out devils we're gonna cast out devils I mean if he healed the sick we're gonna heal the sick if he if he rock for giveness of sin we're gonna bring forgiveness of sin if he brought mercy and compassion we're gonna bring mercy and compassion whatever Jesus did we're gonna do it cuz he said the works that I do you're gonna do also and greater that means say you do because I go to my father therefore they laid hands on the sick they were healed they spoke with new tongues they did great signs and wonders because that was in God's promises and when Jesus died to redeem that back to them the grounds that belong to the sons of God he demonstrated what God was if you want to look and see what you're to be in this last day go back and look at Jesus how Darren you said we try to socialize that and put in an organization we have no rights to do that it's the Holy Spirit today honey now the honest hearts that will believe the message and everything in the Bible that was promised is to that believer when you're accepted in his fullness and God knows you and do it he gives you the abstract to that and then ever promised that it's made is in your possession and the Holy Spirit is there to quicken that to you he says Oh what kind of people are we to be see how wonderful to see at God's great Holy Spirit here to do that power think of it when the Holy Ghost is self here to bear record of this our jesus said so he's the same yesterday today and forever how dare any man to wipe that out of there the works that I do say you do also done 14:12 these signs shall follow them that believe that is the and their assurance and when we see a group of people a man manifesting themselves that is assurance that the abstract is there to vindicate that that is the prophecy the property of God amen Oh hallelujah listen when we see it in a group of people when we see the Holy Spirit moving when we see him in our worship when we see lives have been changed when we see the sick has been healed when we see the cancer has been repulsed when we see that brave leads had paid it away when we see the crippled children whoa hallelujah that's the assurance the abstract is there to vindicate that is the property of God hallelujah I want to put the devil on notice today we are God's property and Satan you gotta take your hands up adopts property and furthermore every promise in this word gives God's property and ever get against us has been paid and we are the redeemed and Satan you gotta get your dirty stuff off of our property [Applause] because we are in an Easter we are in a time the resurrection a man wearing the time metal suffered stands and be healed we're not tagging he says I am the resurrection and the life and there's a people beginning to realize I am that resurrection promised in this last day it has begin with me I'm the first fruit of it unless we raised from the dead either doctor not nationalism there would be no hope for the resurrection of the ages so God made you a first fruit that you can experience the exact same experience that came down on the day of Pentecost that you too could have that same Pentecostal experience were the word no mores in books and tapes and on tablets of stone but it's taken and written in your nature changes your thickens and your your affections put some on things above so he said we are Easter also we are now in our Easter little bride I'm trying to tell you something around the world we are in and Easter this is Resurrection hour hallelujah you cannot have that harvest unless there's a first fruit [Applause] thank God waves his people in this generation Oh No when Jesus was waved there before them show that I am Alive I'm not dead called Mary Magdalene by name Mary he was on a public show it wasn't a worldwide sweeping thing come on it was an appearing to the elect and that's what he does in this last day in this time he appears to the elect and he shows you you're not dead you're not dead in sins and trespasses you're not dead in cold call creeds and denominationalism you are and I'm going to show your life I'm gonna demonstrate it in your life hallelujah amen notice notice this brother Branham calls us a Pentecostal experience you must experience Pentecost many customers who live in others sheet you must experience Pentecost he's clear about this Pentecost is not an organization it is an experience and it is one you must experience you see they waited in the upper room in a hundred and twenty collectively received it and then three thousand souls were added but with the Gentiles they received it individually at the house of Cornelius and other places throughout the book of Acts so you're not looking for 120 of us or 3,000 like this or that and big crowds and so on and I am one be outpoured it's not moving and meeting an individual here having an experience with Cornelius he I'm there or with these over here a little group over there pieces of Ephesus over here and over there and over there every one of you at separate times and then receive your Pentecostal hallelujah the day received it yet the promises to you and to our children and to them that are far off and it as many as the Lord our God shall call he's still callin hallelujah doors ain't closed yet hallelujah fact the book has been open and it's calling all the names who's not shut them up is calling the names the same Holy Ghost that fell there in the tight on the day of Pentecost engage the church a clear deed then it must come and give you clearance if you're going in the rapture let me share from you it is the rising of the Sun brother Branham says like the Pentecostal experienced today and the coming of the Holy Ghost in the last days is promised it's like the abstract to a title deed so those are you two don't want Pentecost I don't know what you're gonna do because pen this is the truth Pentecost you see he would tell us and it is if the restoration of right tree that he said you know the first day Jesus is dead in the tomb Luther second day he's dead in the tomb Wesley because why it was killed on a Roman tree in in the times of the of the Dark Ages and now it starts coming up he said still more dead forms and still more dead forms and so on and he said Dan he says it comes to this last age and he said first there's a rumor that he's alive that he's the same yesterday today and forever and this is why the Susan Street was they were a rumor they were rumor that something was happening but then he appears is appearing and where does he appear in right form hallelujah are you with me down Amen you saved brother Jim we're not a zoo so sweet no we're not the room we're the appearing and there's a difference between the rumor and the appearance I'm Adam we are here to be waived as a seat in the last day Satan Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he still filled with the Holy Ghost his power is still the same his healing is still the same his miracles is still the same his life sacred power he's still the same so like the Pentecostal experience today in the coming of the Holy Ghost in this last day as promised is like an abstract to the title deed you can get a title you can get a title to the place but that still don't say it belongs to you no sir somebody way back yonder could come and put a claim on it no sir but when you get a abstract that shows that aired that everything that was ever struck off plumb back to the foundation everything that's been against instruct all plumbing back to the foundation and when a man said that he believes the word and then when the Holy Spirit comes it is the abstract to the title now there's a lot of people going around today brother Tim we got the Holy Ghost because we believe the message no you've got that's a deed you got the title but there's still claims that's why there's still to smoke him to drink in the Papa nog Rafi the secrets inin the adulteries has all gone on in message churches are you with me I meant cuz they got a deed they believed on the Lord and they got a deed but if the death hasn't been paid and Satan's still got a claim how many how many people around the world today Satan's still got a claim on their life they claim the message I've been baptized in Jesus name I've done this I've done that but Satan's still got a claim on them there's still sin unbelief darkness hey man you say brother Tim does that mean your flesh is perfected never my flesh isn't perfected - my body's changed but what does it mean my but my flesh is broader than their subjection to the Holy Ghost and the life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave His life for me so when when a man who says he believes the word which is where a lot of people are and then he said when the Holy Spirit comes he gives an abstract to the title and it gives you permission when you have that abstract that ever bit of that belongs to you and everything on it belongs to you and that gives us abstract when the Holy Ghost comes upon this title deed that God saw before the foundation of the world and put a name in the book of life but was born through a man and a woman and something to seeing and gives you sin but when I believe it when I believed on it I received the deed but when the Holy Ghost came was the abstract that everything against me whether my mother done it oh my father done it my grandmother done it like the little epileptic child I prayed for a few minutes ago that come through down through the grandparents epilepsy fell down upon the child but when the abstract has come it struck off and emitted everything and I am an abstract holder then and it sure is the spirit that raised up Christ from the dead I have an abstract deed that I'm a part of that body with the abstract of the Holy Ghost making the body of the word live out just exactly like it did in him as he promised in the last days the abstract and all my sins are struck out and all your sins are struck out about the blood of Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost has come as an abstract to the title deed that God gave me by grace by foreknowledge so he says what are you scared about no wonder he said fear not I am he that was dead and him alive again and alive forevermore and I had the keys that doesn't help don't worry about nothing even death ain't gonna hurt you amen why no fear because we're in the land with every other claim against this knocked off when the book was sealed by claims against us are you with me the Bible is our title but the Holy Ghost is our accept amen which throws out the squat when Satan like a Goliath comes on your land and claims your property the Holy Ghost is your token and then your sign that the lamb has took your place and everything against you is struck off so Goliath we're throwing you off the land hallelujah you show him your token is somebody with me I'm Anna Mattel this over and over again show him your token amen it's time to display the Holy Ghost hallelujah my services it's time to display the Holy Ghost when we have to sit it's time to display the token the Holy Ghost amen when we face the situation it's time to display the Holy Ghost this is a time of the Sheep wait where the bride must be on display so show him your token it's an abstract now what's this don't let your heart be troubled come on read this and read it carefully for now what fully now fully obedience to the whole Word of God entitles us to the dope full obedience to the whole Word of God entitles you to the token well IIIi told you this my dress right am I looking looking right am I doing this right huh am i I am a conducting this all right you know I I I gotta have the token so how do you do this let me read it again this is from another quotation full obedience to the whole Word of God to God's entire Word will entitle you this token you're even asking how am I gonna obey it all and everything have the Holy Ghost empower me and I got it you know how in the world we're gonna do this we've got attention you know Israel had to obey the message of a prophet had to take a lamb slay the lamb apply the blood get the lamb out cook the lamb with fire eat the lamb and the unleavened bread eat it with your self arrayed with your garments you stop in your hand and this entitled him to a token so that the death angel would pass over their house they had to fully obey the Word of God to be entitled to the token that was back then and that that things will was coming it's very important that we know how to do this so how do you do it here's way I'm quoting brother Branham again how do you do it Peter said on the day of Pentecost repair them for one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost to token for the promises unto you and to your children and to them that's far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call so when I accept God's lamb and I completely surrender my will then I am entitled to the token get it out of your head I'm I not even a bunch of laws of do's and don'ts it's not keeping walls and dude show me what to do tell me how address tell me how I wear my clothes tell me I wear my hair tell me huh you don't sir should a woman wear pajamas should this happen to do one thing repent surrender your will to God down to sin be buried in his name and you sigh receive the gift of the Holy Ghost entitles you to that token so everyone that will repent everyone who will surrender their life every one of them are entitled to the token are you with me now and the token there is the free pass the death angel must pass over so brother Anton said then when we pray you want to know how to pray we got to want to know how to pray we're not just saying we're not just going to be facing a lot of these and new diseases that are coming and problems in this last day well we've heard of all kinds all B's already before SARS and the bow lion swine flu I lived through it didn't you when we saw swine flu when we saw pigs fly I left do it didn't you get that brother hell but notice you know he saves his head to keep his Mon route from showdown he's my buddy I can pick on him so but now we're gonna face a lot of things some of you may even face just Kovac 19 or whatever so we got to know how to pray some of you today under the sound of my voice you're facing cancer you're facing other situations that just as bad there are situations right here among us where there's some real needs we got to know how to pray when we pray we must have our token that's our abstract clear deed our claim to the promise two percent with our prayer hallelujah are you with me you say Oh Lord I pray but really I haven't well you might as well don't just well stop go ahead first go get the token cuz if it's that token is what he'll recognize that's right yes sir when we pray then we must present the token Lord I have a beta you fully amen I've repented of my sins I feel you have forgiven me don't do any good unless you accept that forgiveness I have been baptized into the name of Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit is upon me now I have need of a certain thing for your glory lord I ask for it it's mine now hallelujah why you are presenting your token with your prayer amen that I have a right to ask for this Satan has got on my land Satan has attacked my family Satan has come in the church Satan is brother's disease and afflictions but I've got a the son of God to say get off healing is my position deliverance is my position the promise in the book is mine and I've got a token a clear deed to prove to you that you don't have a claim for my life therefore whatever I ask in his name I'm the receive it you've gotta stand there in your position blood son daughter of the Living God hi every painter I know my position that's the Holy Ghost I am a child of God I Know Who I am not Satan take it down hands off of my property hallelujah you gotta square your shoulders back walk out there with your badge of authority which is the name of Jesus Christ and say I come in his name Satan now take your hands off of my brother take your hands off of my sister take your hands off of my child take your hands off of my husband take your hands off of the church you cannot you cannot hold open any more we got an abstract man Jesus could have called twelve legions of angels somebody help me preach man that's what that's about dad that's nearly 80 somethin thousands of angels that he could have called there that he could have called for to his aid right there and he said I could call them so can you hallelujah so can you and then you got a need in your life you can call that's the answer because you've got a claim to the property you got a knapsack need and man it says it is yours it has been cleared hallelujah a man it means now now listen brother Brendan said you must be born again it don't mean jump up and down in the altar I don't mean walk back there and shake hands with the pastor see it's neither an intellectual conception are just some emotional work up some people want to focus on just just you know it's new you can't be emotional can't be sensation sensations yet with it your prophet said it isn't sensation but sensations with it it's an experience and man if someone some want to do away with that so he he says it don't mean jumping down to the altar there's your sensation and they don't mean walk back there and shake hands with the pastor that's your intellectual conception people can't walk a balance they either get over here until Mosul is Ammar way over here and into intellectualism but just in case you're wondering your prophet told you it is better to err on the side of fanaticism than it is on intellectualism he said I would rather have wildfire than no fighter a man but he said it doesn't mean come down the altar and jump up and down it doesn't mean walk back there and shake hands with the pastor that made all this foolishness we've seen nothing it doesn't mean putting your name on a church but it means death to your first being like to your second being it means the blood has been applied and you're identified by the life of Jesus Christ if he'd be the fine and we'd be the branches the life that is in the branch is also from the vine he'll buy the fruit and he said when you've got to talk and it shows you of Abeid everywhere what weird or what I required repent be baptized in his name and you sigh receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's the obedience that entitles you to the token you say well I did that a lie I didn't get the Holy Ghost then go back and look at your repentance come on and then go back and look at make sure you surrender your whole wheel to God make sure you die doubt yourself make sure you die upon your altar that's he dad up on the cross and that you are demo fide in this depth because the problem isn't God is because there's some loose cannon in your life let me stop there just a minute there was one time a man he was called a cannoneer he was on a ship they had these big cannons you know many of them were sometimes would be on wheels depends on the ship for its protections against pirates they would be there that would have them in one position on one side of the boat but they could be wield real quickly or pretty quickly just in minutes to go face another ship on the other side but you know that wild that cannon master he had to make sure the cannon was secured because when the storms come if it got loose then that heavy several time machine the piece of equipment rolling back and forth across the deck would kill and maim N and then the storms that wasn't fastened down it could batter the sides until it broke through it was very dangerous to have a loose cannon and you've got to realize there are things in your life that God put there and they're there you know they're they're there let's just say passion for procreation it is there it's permitted by God but there's got to be tied down by the Holy Spirit somebody with me and man because there could be some trials it comes in your marriage and you you will lose maybe some of the the first sloughed that you once had and we must all work really hard to keep that first love that we have for our mates there's somebody with me but even there if you're unmarried it's got to be down by the Holy Ghost because it's going to be temptations at school there's going to be temptation as close as your cell phone and by the way looking at pornography is adultery you are guilty I'm committing adultery or fornication it's exactly right but looking upon a woman and lust sooner after in your heart it's sin and there's gonna have to be something that ties down does that canon of passion a man that can be useful in a marriage but can great being great harm to your family destruct claim caused the boat to go down divorces to happened little children's homes split up your temper your temper is another thing you know it's got to be tied down we always say about temper it's such a great thing you should never lose it without it you're spineless weakling and then you need a backbone you need a strength you need a temper but you need a channel you need to tie down a man because they're storms covered and then every one of you will face storms you'll face storms when I don't face storm but you'll face storms I will face stone and everything in your life has to be tied down this is the same concept brother man I'm talking about the train car and it being packed and inspected so that it doesn't break loose on the journey and then the seal is put on it because it must reach its destination so this wagon master or this cannon master he was neglectful about his duties a little bit slothful a little bit lazy didn't get his job done not in time the storms come and it broke loose his fellow soldiers get killed sailors get killed others remain crippled I can't walk they're in a horrible condition somebody with me and man finally the storm comes through you know and then they get it and come they get the cannon back in place but who walked the plank was the cannon master he had caused all the damage because he had neglected to tie down the canta canta and let me just tell you in your life it's the same thing we got things in our lives that has to be tied down in and anchored by the Holy Ghost and this is what the Holy Ghost does it anchors you it anchors those things in life so that when trials come when temptations come you it is chained down it doesn't move because every one of you me myself every one of us all of us are subject to temptations we're subject to trials and storms but something must hold you [Music] because if it breaks loose it causes damage to the home to the marriage to the church to your family into your God it's important the token it shows you of obeyed every word then you and the word are one and he says then you're only asking for the thing that you are because I'm of the word I am the word then I'm only asking for what belongs to me so if you say hand reach out for that handkerchief it doesn't see hand obeyed me why it's a part of me and when you and the word becomes one every promise cord to God every promises it obeys you but then you want to watch what you want to do you wouldn't put your hand in a fire just to say see me I did do it no no there's there's something in that fire I gotta reach for it it little baby that's right see you wanna watch what you do it and that's ways that Holy Spirit is given out and things sparingly give it out and things you know what I mean because you a real servant of God doesn't show up with it you see that's making a show but when we pray we present the token it shows we have fully obeyed and being baptized in this token into the body of Christ first Christmas well now we are subject to the gifts of the Spirit that's in there the world of believe in the hand gives the trench don't believe in gifts but God's Word set serious gifts and it takes only that token to act denta fie those gifts absolutely and then him is all the fullness and in him is all the fullness of God and the fullness of the promise and when we're baptizing him we have ever promised that God made they did our fingertips we've heard it enough well you don't divine healing there's a minor and you don't major on a minor well let me tell you you can't have the major without the minor if you got the full gospel and you got it all and man if the word is restored they won't brother Tim when that which is perfect is come that which is in Parkdale has done away with that's right when the perfect word comes in is just having parties done away with we're not in an age at a time but we just have part of it we have every part of the word we have every promise of the word wherever healing that scripture that's in the word come on we have ever gift in the body everything is ours because the day of having part is done away with a man even the part of being a child and jumping up and down and trying to speak into us is over with but real pain and the real Holy Ghost hangover wealth but you see what we're talking about in this day is that ecclesiastical spirit that wants to take away the moving of the Spirit and by the Holy Ghost and that's where the death angel is in the land and that's what we got a realize for churches are dying and they are closed it's not just store closes somebody help me preach now his churches that are drying up and died on the vine because they didn't go and get the Holy Ghost and the death angel is coming through with it with the doors of creeds and dogmas and sealing away and send away the movement of the Holy Ghost but it's been released back to us by the evening time message a man that the Holy Ghost is no longer bound anymore it's it's the time of freedom it's the Jubilee it's the Pentecost is the waving of the sheath it's the time to display that oh God [Applause] listen sickness can't stay in this presence if Satan puts them in your hands and tries to tempt you into something you hold your token in your hands and so it you're a redeemed product of Jesus Christ let your own adulterated faith waiver that token they're saying I am a product that Jesus Christ but a man in sickness flees a man how in the world what I mean they don't have a vaccine for this stuff then you don't have any you know immunity and your body for this stuff you've never developed an antibody for this stuff but you've got a token wave that in the face of Satan hallelujah that I am the Redeemer son or daughter of the Living God and sicknesses gotta flee becomes in the name of Jesus and man will withstand ever the season ever sickness and will stand there on the Word of God and see it prevail hallelujah I'm talking to a church that will prevail I'm talking to a church that's on display I'm talking to a body of believers around the world that is believes that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he said what made that big tumor disappeared my wife yesterday just a few days ago she's ready for the operating table now they can't find one thing it isn't that sickness don't strike it's that we got a word to repulse it hey man oh yes it's because of the power the resurrection of Jesus Christ the token that he still lives that destroyed it what does these things happen it's cause God promised it in your product hold the token in your unwavering faith in his promise word if Satan tries to hand you some of this stuff like sickness you know what to do get out my bottle of oregano go to their doctor doctors don't have cure very well what do we do show him your token I am a purchased product my feeling has been paid for I'm the product of God coz I have the token of the Holy Ghost you can't keep me off for this highway you can't keep me from my health I present the token and show you by His stripes I was healed here is a resurrection of Jesus Christ right now in me to prove it to you oh there's a real thing there's the token and it don't just happen for preachers it's till Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover forgive me if I don't recount this right and completely right a lot of times when you're speaking off-the-cuff you get details wrong but you'll get the gist of it sister Eileen Wallner she's here god bless you the Walters they took us down through life's journey the other day a man we enjoyed that sister Cathy your brother took me down your life's journey I found out where you learned to talk he taught you well but nevertheless as they
