[45:04] in whom he called then he also justified
[45:06] in whom he
[45:08] justified them he also
[45:11] glorified amen god bless you
[45:14] amen as you're seated today i want to
[45:17] just take
[45:18] just a moment before i go into my
[45:20] message today and i want to
[45:22] i want to congratulate and wish
[45:26] my bosom friends brother donny
[45:30] reagan his wife sister carol they both
[45:33] had a
[45:33] happy birthday on june on july the 9th
[45:36] and congratulations on their
[45:38] 47th wedding anniversary on july the 8th
[45:42] and they're an example of true love and
[45:45] devotion to
[45:46] each other and to god and i want you to
[45:48] know we stand
[45:49] in solidarity you know the same
[45:52] like-mindedness with brother donnie
[45:54] i've loved him and his ministry from the
[45:56] very first time i've met him some 33
[45:59] years ago
[46:00] and we became instant friends and he
[46:03] even
[46:03] he and i have not just been close
[46:06] friends
[46:07] um but through the years there's
[46:09] probably no minister that i can say that
[46:11] i agree with
[46:12] doctrinally more than him and he's a
[46:15] great student of the word and well
[46:17] versed in the knowledge of the message
[46:19] an anointed servant of god with a
[46:22] supernatural ministry
[46:24] vindicated with signs that follow the
[46:26] believers and of course i recommend
[46:28] anybody who lives in that area to go to
[46:30] church there
[46:31] it's a well-balanced ministry amen it's
[46:33] certainly been a blessing to us
[46:35] through the years as we've had him in
[46:37] our special meetings
[46:39] in regular meetings through the years
[46:41] and in youth camps and
[46:43] and dedication services and just
[46:46] wonderful times
[46:48] um together um there are several things
[46:51] that i
[46:51] want to talk to you about today before
[46:53] we go into our message and so
[46:56] um if you just settle down for a moment
[47:00] you know the other day i made mention of
[47:02] sister lana she just had a
[47:05] clear scan just a few days ago a few
[47:08] weeks ago now
[47:10] and the kin remains cancer free
[47:13] and we thank god for that and man she
[47:16] had a great moment of victory
[47:18] um in the service of february 18 2018
[47:23] where i was preaching on the revealing
[47:25] of sons
[47:27] and that's now been nearly two and a
[47:29] half years ago
[47:31] and god is still on the throne
[47:35] still manifesting his great glory and
[47:37] that same
[47:38] service we had a brother john
[47:41] christophel
[47:42] from south africa that contacted me
[47:46] about his wife's condition
[47:48] of stage 3 rectal cancer and
[47:51] he being in south africa there he had
[47:53] been able unable to get a job
[47:55] and he was in a very bad financial
[47:57] condition
[47:59] a young young minister and his wife and
[48:01] they were
[48:02] struggling and struggling with the um
[48:06] the the medical bills and so on and
[48:09] and um you know we we at that time were
[48:13] certainly uh preaching a lot of
[48:16] different things
[48:17] along the realm of faith and believing
[48:20] for sister lanna
[48:21] and just encourage her and encourage the
[48:24] people
[48:25] encourage us to believe god for his
[48:28] words and his promises
[48:30] and um to see god come on the scene and
[48:34] to see um the lord heal sister lana with
[48:37] that
[48:37] fourth stage hodgkin's lymph lymphoma
[48:40] and god healed her and delivered her
[48:43] just instantly completely
[48:45] and um you know where that she went back
[48:48] the next
[48:49] day on the i think it was a 19th on a
[48:52] monday or tuesday at least
[48:54] just that week and had a scan and
[48:56] doctors didn't know what to say about it
[48:59] and there it is right there where the
[49:01] cancer is in the lung and there it is
[49:03] the next scan and there's
[49:05] there is absolutely no cancer
[49:08] and this is still the testimony today
[49:11] two and a half years later
[49:13] amen we thank god for that
[49:16] [Applause]
[49:20] this um very same time that this was
[49:23] going on this brother from
[49:25] south africa i've never met him but you
[49:28] know there's just sometimes it's
[49:30] things just grip your heart and he told
[49:33] me about his situation and
[49:35] and um and so he
[49:39] i told him i would send him a prayer
[49:41] cloth because
[49:42] we we believed according to the book of
[49:46] acts that they took
[49:47] uh handkerchiefs from the body or aprons
[49:50] from the body of saint paul and
[49:52] laid them upon the sick and they were
[49:53] healed now
[49:55] of course we're not saint paul but
[49:58] he's still the same jesus amen
[50:02] and his word is still the truth so we
[50:04] sent out in the
[50:05] i prayed over that in the post and and
[50:08] uh this same
[50:10] week of sister lana's scan i received a
[50:14] um an unsolicited email
[50:17] with from brother john uh giving me um
[50:20] photos of his wife and his testimony
[50:24] and i wanted to just go back
[50:27] into that service just a moment where
[50:30] that we
[50:30] prayed for her and i i want to i'm doing
[50:33] this for a reason
[50:34] i'm doing this for a reason because i i
[50:36] think we must
[50:38] come with very great sincerity in every
[50:41] service
[50:42] expecting god to move and when we pray
[50:46] if it's even somebody from overseas
[50:48] somewhere
[50:49] over in south africa we never heard of
[50:51] we've never seen
[50:53] it doesn't matter they're our brother
[50:54] and sister in christ and we're going to
[50:57] pray with fervency and believe god for
[51:00] them
[51:00] amen so michael if you will take us back
[51:03] into that service just for a moment just

[59:56] just wanted to tell you a little bit
[59:59] before
[1:00:00] we go into the message this morning what
[1:00:02] we've been through in the last couple of
[1:00:04] weeks as you know the last two sundays i
[1:00:07] i have not been in the pulpit we um
[1:00:10] we have of course um had some situations
[1:00:14] in
[1:00:15] at home where my wife had a complete a
[1:00:18] tremendous brain bleed there and was
[1:00:20] sent to
[1:00:22] the hospital into lsu where they did
[1:00:24] surgery on her
[1:00:26] um you may not know and i understand the
[1:00:30] severity of where we were
[1:00:32] but um the doctors gave us very grim
[1:00:35] news said that
[1:00:36] you know she could live five minutes or
[1:00:38] five years but
[1:00:39] she would not have any quality of life
[1:00:41] if she did
[1:00:42] and they came out and and told me just
[1:00:46] to prepare for death
[1:00:47] that that's how severe that it was even
[1:00:50] when i got the call from lsu
[1:00:52] i knew by the way that they um asked me
[1:00:55] about the surgery that they wasn't given
[1:00:58] much hope for her recovery and um
[1:01:02] as you know today we're we're here on
[1:01:05] the other side of that and we can
[1:01:07] rejoice
[1:01:08] because there's no loss of limb no loss
[1:01:10] of memory
[1:01:12] it means she's complete
[1:01:17] amen we thank god for that
[1:01:20] and god has answered prayer just
[1:01:24] to kind of go back over some of these
[1:01:26] things just for a moment
[1:01:28] a week before last you know brother ron
[1:01:31] spencer was here
[1:01:33] it was kind of a surprise visit um
[1:01:36] most of you didn't know about it because
[1:01:38] we kept it secret brother ron
[1:01:40] spencer is a pastor friend of ours from
[1:01:43] over in virginia and um he is a
[1:01:46] muslim friend of of mine and and uh
[1:01:49] someone that i love very much
[1:01:52] and he has had
[1:01:56] stage four melanoma cancer
[1:02:00] it spread from his lungs and jumped into
[1:02:03] his brain
[1:02:04] just right after that he got it he had a
[1:02:07] first aid clear
[1:02:08] brain scan and then you know uh
[1:02:12] and i just thankful well it's not in his
[1:02:14] brain it's just in his lungs well
[1:02:16] he jumped right immediately into the
[1:02:18] lungs
[1:02:20] from the lungs into the brain but um
[1:02:23] you know he has steadfastly believed and
[1:02:26] we've been praying and believing with
[1:02:27] him
[1:02:28] and by the way brother timothy caught
[1:02:30] the wind of the spirit this morning
[1:02:32] as we as as i just had it on the tip of
[1:02:36] my tongue
[1:02:37] to tell you don't go and pray for your
[1:02:38] mom don't go and pray for brother ron
[1:02:40] you go and thank god for their healing
[1:02:43] that's what i want you to do i want you
[1:02:45] to thank god
[1:02:46] it's already done amen we're confessing
[1:02:50] it and we're believing it
[1:02:52] but he had preached at his own home
[1:02:53] church um
[1:02:55] just um a bit prior to him coming
[1:02:59] the weekend before he was coming i must
[1:03:01] get to jesus
[1:03:02] and in reference to the queen of the
[1:03:05] south
[1:03:06] uh who came to hear the wisdom of
[1:03:08] solomon
[1:03:09] he noted that you know that people would
[1:03:13] would drive 17 18 hours to get
[1:03:16] into brother branham's meetings to get
[1:03:18] in the presence of jesus and
[1:03:20] would be healed and it struck him
[1:03:22] afterwards that he must do the same
[1:03:25] and so he wanted to drive over here to
[1:03:27] louisiana
[1:03:29] and spend some time with me and for me
[1:03:31] to pray for him
[1:03:33] now of course you know i'm not a healer
[1:03:35] the lord is a healer but
[1:03:37] um it's there's gifts in the body and
[1:03:40] gifts of healing is one
[1:03:42] let me explain it like this uh just
[1:03:44] sharing this from
[1:03:46] looking under jesus and said you know
[1:03:48] what the gift of healing is
[1:03:50] faith in healing you just release your
[1:03:52] faith to pray for somebody
[1:03:54] that's all a gift of healing is every
[1:03:56] minister should have it
[1:03:58] everybody you see should have a gift of
[1:04:00] healing the power
[1:04:02] that heals you is on the inside of you
[1:04:04] the holy spirit
[1:04:05] you just have to let it work its way out
[1:04:08] so brother ron wanted to come
[1:04:10] and and we were excited about him coming
[1:04:12] i
[1:04:13] started praying and fasting in
[1:04:16] preparation for his coming here he was
[1:04:19] going to leave
[1:04:20] his after church on sunday and drive
[1:04:23] here and would arrive on monday
[1:04:26] which he did but after making the
[1:04:28] decision to come
[1:04:30] he told his family now you just watch
[1:04:33] the devil try to stop this and
[1:04:37] and of course he did but the devil don't
[1:04:40] have enough
[1:04:43] amen my wife karen was excited about him
[1:04:46] coming
[1:04:47] she was gonna make his favorite german
[1:04:50] chocolate cake and
[1:04:51] went shopping on thursday to get all the
[1:04:53] supplies for
[1:04:54] his arrival and and um and then
[1:04:58] that night at about 11 p.m she woke me
[1:05:01] up by going to the
[1:05:02] bathroom turning on the light and i
[1:05:05] asked her if she was okay and
[1:05:07] she said i've got a terrible headache
[1:05:09] and she mentioned she was going into
[1:05:10] another room and
[1:05:12] and um uh take her blood pressure
[1:05:16] i followed her in there and found her
[1:05:18] with her head on the table groaning
[1:05:21] and um i said we we got to go to the
[1:05:24] hospital now
[1:05:25] and she said that she protested no i
[1:05:28] don't want to go i don't need to go
[1:05:30] i just threw a robe around her and made
[1:05:32] her get in the car
[1:05:33] and we were you know on her way she was
[1:05:35] just groaning and
[1:05:36] moaning and there would be moments that
[1:05:39] i was
[1:05:40] thought she had passed out and she
[1:05:42] became nauseated throwing up
[1:05:44] and uh i was going to drive all the way
[1:05:46] to shreveport because that's where the
[1:05:48] neuro
[1:05:49] unit is in the trauma unit in shreveport
[1:05:52] at the lsu
[1:05:53] oscars and the doctors but i i couldn't
[1:05:57] make it that far because of her throwing
[1:05:59] up and the pain level and so i
[1:06:01] whipped into menden medical center and
[1:06:04] there
[1:06:05] they um intubated her and she
[1:06:08] was totally unconscious doctor's report
[1:06:11] from the scans was she wasn't going to
[1:06:13] make it
[1:06:15] yeah she had a huge brain bleed it was
[1:06:17] pushing the right side of her brain
[1:06:19] out of position and the damage would
[1:06:21] cause her
[1:06:22] to die and if she lived and the doctor
[1:06:25] said she would only be a vegetable
[1:06:28] well friday morning sister karen had
[1:06:31] emergency brain surgery
[1:06:33] where they relieved the pressure they
[1:06:35] cauterized the vessels
[1:06:38] and um you know i
[1:06:41] as i was just praying and assessing the
[1:06:43] situation
[1:06:44] i just began to realize that she was
[1:06:46] there in the nicu
[1:06:49] that and and i stood beside her there
[1:06:52] immediately i watched her she was
[1:06:54] wheeled out of surgery and
[1:06:56] stood there by her bedside on friday and
[1:06:59] saturday morning i was there again and
[1:07:02] as i was praying there i just said you
[1:07:04] know
[1:07:04] i'm not going to let this stop brother
[1:07:06] ron from coming
[1:07:08] and so i made arrangements for for my
[1:07:11] daughters to
[1:07:12] um to go to the icu room since their
[1:07:16] mother was
[1:07:16] really you know out of it didn't didn't
[1:07:19] know
[1:07:20] really what was going on and so i made
[1:07:23] arrangements for them to go
[1:07:24] and i called brother ron and i said um i
[1:07:28] i
[1:07:28] you come on i said we'll we'll meet over
[1:07:30] at our camp there at haven's rest and
[1:07:33] and uh so he he
[1:07:36] he came they left right after church on
[1:07:40] sunday he ministered they drove
[1:07:42] all the way to birmingham from
[1:07:43] birmingham they came
[1:07:45] here to louisiana monday night we had a
[1:07:48] prayer meeting together
[1:07:50] and i guarantee you when you're in a
[1:07:52] moment like this you just don't just say
[1:07:54] god bless so-and-so and so
[1:07:56] it's a moment of desperation and um
[1:08:00] you know it was a great time in the
[1:08:02] presence of the lord but i just felt
[1:08:04] like there was
[1:08:04] more and i knew i would have another
[1:08:07] opportunity and tuesday evening we spent
[1:08:10] the evening
[1:08:11] speaking of the exploits of faith and
[1:08:14] creating as i tried to channel the
[1:08:17] conversation
[1:08:18] because i wanted to generate a an
[1:08:22] atmosphere of faith and we just began to
[1:08:24] talk about
[1:08:25] exploits of faith and different
[1:08:27] testimonies of god's healing power
[1:08:30] and i i began to feel the atmosphere get
[1:08:34] more and more
[1:08:34] charged and brother aaron
[1:08:37] and and of course brother timothy
[1:08:39] brother michael dexter
[1:08:41] was there and and brother aaron was
[1:08:43] about to leave and i said don't leave i
[1:08:45] said
[1:08:46] you know i won't we want to pray we're
[1:08:48] going to have another time of prayer
[1:08:50] and this time there was a breakthrough
[1:08:52] to the anointing
[1:08:54] and then the then as as we've seen the
[1:08:58] holy spirit just come
[1:08:59] down there was just things that was you
[1:09:02] know had been on brother
[1:09:03] ron's heart he he desired to come back
[1:09:06] to louisiana again
[1:09:08] the devil told him he would never be
[1:09:09] here again and then he wanted to be in a
[1:09:12] prayer line with me again
[1:09:14] and the devil told him you'll never have
[1:09:15] another prayer line with brother tim
[1:09:17] but right there in that in that camp we
[1:09:20] had a prayer line and prayed for
[1:09:22] luke and andrew and adam frazier
[1:09:24] connie's nephew and
[1:09:26] god just moved upon them in a tremendous
[1:09:28] way
[1:09:29] filling them with the holy spirit of god
[1:09:31] and and um
[1:09:33] you know what a presence that was and we
[1:09:36] saw the holy spirit
[1:09:37] move and then wednesday night we come to
[1:09:41] church
[1:09:41] and brother ron and i spent time
[1:09:43] together in my office
[1:09:45] where as you know the tesla he testified
[1:09:48] of seeing the angel of god and together
[1:09:50] we prayed again right in that very same
[1:09:52] spot
[1:09:53] and since that time god has given
[1:09:55] brother ron some amazing strength
[1:09:58] and he is preached with such anointing
[1:10:01] such anointing and
[1:10:03] such power since that time and
[1:10:06] i checked upon him as he arrived home
[1:10:09] leaving wednesday night and let me just
[1:10:11] stop here for a moment
[1:10:12] because that wednesday night service
[1:10:14] went right on over to
[1:10:16] brother timothy's house and followed
[1:10:17] them into the house
[1:10:19] that anointing and the holy spirit fell
[1:10:21] upon his children
[1:10:22] the girls there adriana and katie and
[1:10:26] god did some amazing things in their
[1:10:28] life
[1:10:29] adriana was testifying to me that she
[1:10:31] got what she needed
[1:10:33] to be able to testify i have the holy
[1:10:35] spirit in my life
[1:10:37] what a wonderful thing god's moving
[1:10:40] amen what he did for them he'll do for
[1:10:43] you

[1:10:57] see his dad and has to come three two
[1:10:58] hours back and
[1:11:00] the next day he's gone again doing a
[1:11:03] route with
[1:11:03] with his son and and different things

[1:11:55] god is thou shalt i and he's more than
[1:11:58] enough to meet your need

[1:12:03] a repression from his presence
[1:12:06] to give you another filling of the holy
[1:12:08] ghost to take out the lukewarmness

[1:21:58] apology to the devil
[1:22:00] nothing to do with him not ashamed of
[1:22:02] the word not ashamed of your commission
[1:22:04] not ashamed
[1:22:05] of who you are amen
[1:22:09] praise the name of the lord let's look
[1:22:12] back at the scripture this morning
[1:22:15] in romans chapter 8 verse 28.
[1:22:24] you can stand if you'd like that's fine
[1:22:27] it's always good to do that in honor to
[1:22:29] the lord
[1:22:30] and we know that all things work
[1:22:32] together for good to them that love
[1:22:34] god to them who are the called according
[1:22:36] to this purpose
[1:22:38] for whom he did for know he did also
[1:22:40] predestinate
[1:22:41] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:22:45] that's what we're going to be speaking
[1:22:46] on this morning
[1:22:48] is a bride in his image
[1:22:52] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:22:54] that he might be the firstborn
[1:22:57] among many brethren he wasn't just
[1:23:00] satisfied
[1:23:01] with jesus he wants many brethren
[1:23:05] just like jesus moreover whom he did
[1:23:09] predestinate them he also called in whom
[1:23:12] he called
[1:23:12] then he also justified in whom he
[1:23:14] justified
[1:23:16] them he also glorified
[1:23:20] amen god bless you you can have your
[1:23:21] seats
[1:23:24] but not only are we his brethren but
[1:23:26] there's other types
[1:23:28] that show the church even as his wife
[1:23:32] paul said a man and his wife is a
[1:23:35] mystery of christ
[1:23:36] and his church we find also
[1:23:40] in genesis chapter 2 and verse 21 that
[1:23:44] the lord god
[1:23:45] calls to deep sleep to fall upon adam
[1:23:48] and he slept and he took one of his ribs
[1:23:50] and he closed up the fresh the flesh
[1:23:53] instead thereof
[1:23:54] and the rib which the lord god had taken
[1:23:56] from the man made he a woman
[1:23:58] and brought her unto the man and adam
[1:24:01] said
[1:24:02] this is now bone of my bones and flesh
[1:24:06] of my flesh
[1:24:07] she shall be called woman because she
[1:24:09] was taken
[1:24:10] out of man so
[1:24:14] again this was the very first thing
[1:24:17] and even paul would refer back to the
[1:24:20] scripture
[1:24:21] of the oneness between of a man and his
[1:24:24] wife and it being a type
[1:24:26] of christ and his bride that she would
[1:24:28] be
[1:24:29] of him she would be of his life she
[1:24:32] would be of his powers she would be
[1:24:34] of his spirit she would be flesh of his
[1:24:37] flesh and bone of his bone
[1:24:40] but then it also types us as his
[1:24:42] offspring
[1:24:44] and we could read a lot of scriptures on
[1:24:46] this but let's just take this one
[1:24:48] in acts 17 28 for in him we live
[1:24:51] and move and have our being
[1:24:55] as certain also of your own points have
[1:24:57] said for we
[1:24:59] are also his offspring for as much
[1:25:02] then as we are the offspring of god we
[1:25:05] ought not to think of the
[1:25:06] that the godhead is like into gold as
[1:25:08] silver stone or grave and art or man's
[1:25:10] desi
[1:25:11] device in other words like an idol but
[1:25:13] you you need to think of him as a person
[1:25:17] in genesis chapter 1 verse 26
[1:25:21] god said let us make man in our image
[1:25:24] after our likeness let them have
[1:25:26] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[1:25:28] over the fowl of the air
[1:25:29] and over the cattle and over the earth
[1:25:31] and over every creeping thing that
[1:25:33] creepeth upon the earth
[1:25:35] so god created man in his own image in
[1:25:38] the image of god created he him
[1:25:40] male and female created he them
[1:25:43] you see adam was immortal like god
[1:25:48] in his original state his body didn't
[1:25:51] decay
[1:25:52] it didn't grow old and die before the
[1:25:55] fall he was not even a time being
[1:25:58] if it could have been marked in years he
[1:25:59] would you would say he was as strong at
[1:26:02] 200 as he was at 20.
[1:26:05] he was timeless he was ageless he was an
[1:26:07] immortal
[1:26:10] he was an immortal 20 year old
[1:26:13] and it was not until sin entered that
[1:26:15] man
[1:26:16] fell from god's image now
[1:26:19] your first birth is from the perverted
[1:26:22] word
[1:26:23] that the lie that satan taught eve
[1:26:26] that's how
[1:26:27] we were born as adam's offspring
[1:26:30] born in the way that the serpent taught
[1:26:32] eve
[1:26:33] this body is not in god's image
[1:26:37] it decays it grows old it dies
[1:26:41] you're not as strong even at 80 as you
[1:26:43] were at 20.
[1:26:45] sin perverted man's body his spirit
[1:26:48] his soul and satan enthroned
[1:26:52] on himself in man's body to sin in
[1:26:56] and every man fell from that holy image
[1:27:00] but when adam and eve listened to the
[1:27:03] lie of the devil
[1:27:05] the holy image of god left them and and
[1:27:08] their
[1:27:08] fellowship was broken with god
[1:27:12] the fellowship of oneness with god was
[1:27:14] broken the very minute
[1:27:17] they listen to the lie of the devil
[1:27:20] and the very minute that you listen to
[1:27:22] the lie of the devil it'll break your
[1:27:24] fellowship with god
[1:27:26] and that's the very minute that you go
[1:27:28] out of god's presence
[1:27:30] like she did is when you fail to take
[1:27:32] god's word
[1:27:33] just as it is now in
[1:27:37] the fall our faith was blinded and the
[1:27:40] five
[1:27:40] senses of our flesh took preeminence
[1:27:44] man originally was have dominion
[1:27:47] and that word dominion has been lost
[1:27:49] from man
[1:27:51] even though he dominates by the realms
[1:27:53] of his flesh by
[1:27:55] uh by cutting us and devices and things
[1:27:58] and
[1:27:59] and and that he will uh he will dominate
[1:28:02] animals dominate the earth dominate
[1:28:05] other men
[1:28:05] and so on like that but but again
[1:28:08] it's he does it by the realm of the five
[1:28:11] senses
[1:28:13] adam ruled the earth by faith
[1:28:17] amen now and of course you know when
[1:28:20] the fall came in man lost his
[1:28:23] consciousness of what
[1:28:25] the father had put him on the earth to
[1:28:27] do
[1:28:28] in other words all the plumbing as it
[1:28:30] was in our brain the outlets the faith
[1:28:32] has been clogged
[1:28:34] and it gets clogged up even today with
[1:28:37] business affair and domestic life home
[1:28:39] life
[1:28:40] political things all kinds of things
[1:28:42] will clog us up
[1:28:44] the the reasoning of science and
[1:28:46] education
[1:28:47] will all clog up the faith that should
[1:28:50] be flowing to our lives
[1:28:52] clog up the channels and god can't
[1:28:54] operate through that channel of faith
[1:28:56] because we're going on our reasoning our
[1:28:59] memory
[1:29:00] our imagination our conscience or our
[1:29:02] affection
[1:29:04] and just remember i want you to know
[1:29:06] that you know you
[1:29:07] here in this fallen state as a mortal
[1:29:10] being
[1:29:11] and though your soul might be redeemed
[1:29:14] your flesh again is it has to also be
[1:29:18] redeemed
[1:29:19] it's going to be changed it's like your
[1:29:20] soul was changed
[1:29:22] in a moment a twinkling of an eye it
[1:29:24] will be changed and
[1:29:26] we'll be glorified and go into his
[1:29:28] presence
[1:29:29] is that right amen but it's your flesh
[1:29:32] that's what keeps you from seeing god
[1:29:34] face to face you see it is the flesh
[1:29:38] that is what this veil that keeps us
[1:29:41] from seeing
[1:29:42] angels at their position they're always
[1:29:45] there
[1:29:46] the angels of god don't just suddenly
[1:29:49] come
[1:29:50] they encamp about those that fear him
[1:29:53] amen the angels did not come down to
[1:29:56] elisha and gaheza that day
[1:29:58] but no he said i'm there he said the
[1:30:01] angels are here
[1:30:02] god opened the boy's eyes and when his
[1:30:05] eyes became open he became conscious
[1:30:08] through the supernatural realm but your
[1:30:10] flesh
[1:30:11] is what keeps you from seeing god
[1:30:15] it blinds your faith because it is the
[1:30:19] only eye by which you can see
[1:30:21] god with the only thing that you can
[1:30:25] understand and know the supernatural
[1:30:27] with
[1:30:28] is faith now
[1:30:33] the veil is the flesh and this flesh
[1:30:36] keeps us out of his presence even now
[1:30:39] even in service like this it's hard for
[1:30:42] you to keep your channel
[1:30:45] the holy spirit is trying to speak and
[1:30:48] you're trying to open up a channel
[1:30:50] but your mind is wandering you know your
[1:30:52] seed is getting tired
[1:30:54] your body is getting weary you're
[1:30:55] thinking about the pressures of life
[1:30:57] everything else that is going on always
[1:31:00] just for a moment
[1:31:02] we can just press out of this
[1:31:06] amen we can get into the channel of the
[1:31:09] holy spirit
[1:31:10] and it can just strike it like a target
[1:31:13] this morning
[1:31:14] and get right down in your soul and make
[1:31:16] you realize
[1:31:17] god is here unless here all things are
[1:31:21] possible
[1:31:22] my healing is possible my deliverance is
[1:31:24] possible
[1:31:25] my salvation is possible everything is
[1:31:28] possible
[1:31:28] when we realize we're in the presence of
[1:31:30] god
[1:31:31] [Applause]
[1:31:35] this fall you know
[1:31:38] causes to require us to have
[1:31:42] a new birth we must be born again
[1:31:46] we're sons and daughters of god but we
[1:31:48] live in fallen
[1:31:50] mortal bodies sad to say
[1:31:53] you know you can be healed of one thing
[1:31:56] only to be
[1:31:57] sick with it again amen you can have a
[1:32:00] brain bleed and have another brain bleed
[1:32:03] your body's not immortal it's subject to
[1:32:07] weaknesses
[1:32:09] god will heal you like he did the
[1:32:11] apostle paul there come blow after blow
[1:32:13] after blow
[1:32:15] amen but god heals and he heals and he
[1:32:17] heals
[1:32:19] he keeps the deliverance amen delivering
[1:32:22] to your time's up on earth
[1:32:25] amen now this fall
[1:32:29] we know produced two seeds that were
[1:32:32] there was cain the bible said who was of
[1:32:34] that wicked one
[1:32:35] there was abel who was adam's son and
[1:32:38] of course these two races would mix
[1:32:41] together
[1:32:42] just before the flood and would become
[1:32:45] one race and the same thing has happened
[1:32:49] with the church
[1:32:50] that just as eve fell by disbelieving
[1:32:53] the word
[1:32:54] so did the church fall into unbelief
[1:32:57] through
[1:32:58] the dark ages that fell from that
[1:33:01] original experience of the book of acts
[1:33:05] and that became far into the church and
[1:33:08] they become blinded to it
[1:33:09] and they become deafened and blinded
[1:33:12] with theology
[1:33:13] and man's own ideas
[1:33:16] rather than the word of god in acts
[1:33:19] chapter 15 we will find that there was
[1:33:21] pharisees
[1:33:23] which believed who insisted on requiring
[1:33:25] circumcision
[1:33:26] and keeping the law of moses because
[1:33:29] there were certain
[1:33:30] of the pharisees which believed never
[1:33:33] got the new birth
[1:33:36] there was hymenius and alexander who
[1:33:39] brought in a new doctrine
[1:33:40] misinterpreting the scripture
[1:33:42] spiritualizing the resurrection of the
[1:33:44] dead and
[1:33:45] allegorizing away the doctrine of the
[1:33:47] resurrection
[1:33:48] and resolving it into just a figure and
[1:33:50] a metaphor
[1:33:53] and and of course paul told of
[1:33:56] what it did he said their words doth eat
[1:33:58] as a canker
[1:34:00] it has become a cancer in the church and
[1:34:03] the church had become infected
[1:34:05] and diseased rather than a spotless
[1:34:08] sinless bride
[1:34:15] then he went on to then then jesus would
[1:34:18] tell us
[1:34:19] how the spirit of the antichrist was
[1:34:20] already working in the church
[1:34:23] and he would say beware of false
[1:34:25] prophets
[1:34:26] which come to you in sheep clothing but
[1:34:29] inwardly are
[1:34:30] ravering wolves so he told them beware
[1:34:34] because there's coming something that is
[1:34:37] going to push the church off course
[1:34:40] in acts chapter 20 and verse 29 paul
[1:34:43] said
[1:34:43] after my department be departing shall
[1:34:46] grievous wolves
[1:34:47] enter in among you not sparing the flock
[1:34:50] and also of your own selves not
[1:34:52] outsiders
[1:34:54] but within the church shall men arise
[1:34:56] speaking perverse things
[1:34:58] to draw away disciples after themselves
[1:35:02] amen second corinthians 11 13
[1:35:07] he said for these are such are false
[1:35:09] apostles
[1:35:10] deceitful workers transforming
[1:35:12] themselves into apostles of christ
[1:35:16] revelation 2 2 he would tell them i know
[1:35:19] your works
[1:35:20] and this is the first stage thy labor
[1:35:23] and thy patience
[1:35:24] and how thou cannot bear them which are
[1:35:26] evil and has tried them which save their
[1:35:28] apostles or not
[1:35:30] and have found them liars
[1:35:33] and in less than 300 years
[1:35:37] the church was a fallen woman
[1:35:41] bringing forth children of her adultery
[1:35:45] amen now you you know these are hard
[1:35:49] words to speak but this let me tell you
[1:35:51] it tells you
[1:35:53] of two women in the when you come down
[1:35:56] to the book of revelation
[1:35:57] it's really about two women a perfect
[1:36:00] sinless bride
[1:36:02] that he's going to take in a rapture and
[1:36:04] a and her harlot daughters
[1:36:06] who are just like a man
[1:36:10] and she cannot be that kind unless she's
[1:36:13] taken
[1:36:13] and the seeds of another man and receive
[1:36:17] something else for a husband other than
[1:36:19] christ himself
[1:36:20] and that's what makes her the whoreish
[1:36:22] woman
[1:36:23] and i tell you when we are the church of
[1:36:25] any kind
[1:36:26] takes in the words of another man
[1:36:30] other than the words of god we have
[1:36:32] committed the sin of hardem
[1:36:35] israel was guilty of it who was supposed
[1:36:38] to be married to jehovah
[1:36:39] and the gentile church is guilty of the
[1:36:42] same thing
[1:36:44] and until the church has become a
[1:36:46] conglomeration of filth
[1:36:49] and abomination but i want you to know
[1:36:52] in the midst of all of this god will
[1:36:54] have a people
[1:36:55] he will have a bride without a spot or
[1:36:58] wrinkle or a blemish
[1:36:59] his word has declared it he can't look
[1:37:03] back on his word
[1:37:07] like to just share with you this little
[1:37:09] quotation from he cares for you cares
[1:37:11] we got two churches at hand this morning
[1:37:15] one of them is a church
[1:37:16] of pentecost that was organized at
[1:37:19] pentecost
[1:37:20] by the holy spirit there's a difference
[1:37:22] when the holy spirit organizes
[1:37:25] amen puts a church in order amen the
[1:37:28] second is the church of the
[1:37:30] roman catholic church which was
[1:37:33] organized in
[1:37:34] nazi rome one is a spiritual birth
[1:37:37] the other is an intellectual conception
[1:37:40] now you can find
[1:37:41] this is where where the separation is
[1:37:45] in every church and every movement amen
[1:37:49] exactly right amen one of the spiritual
[1:37:52] birth
[1:37:52] the other of an intellectual conception
[1:37:54] right here in this church
[1:37:56] there are those of a spiritual birth and
[1:37:58] others of an intellectual conception
[1:38:01] amen from that church come all
[1:38:03] protestants all denominations come from
[1:38:05] that was the first denomination all
[1:38:07] denominations come
[1:38:08] from that one in our relation to that
[1:38:10] one revelation 17
[1:38:12] she was a and she was a mother of
[1:38:14] harlots
[1:38:15] and pop can't call the kettle greasy see
[1:38:17] because it's it's
[1:38:19] it's just one it's organized it's gone
[1:38:21] it's in rome
[1:38:22] i don't care what it is it is gone the
[1:38:24] bible said we come to those church ages
[1:38:26] to prove
[1:38:27] that one is based on spiritual
[1:38:30] discernment
[1:38:31] the other is based on educational and
[1:38:33] intellectual conception
[1:38:35] amen amen and this is what we come down
[1:38:39] to spiritual discernment
[1:38:41] and the other education i'm going to say
[1:38:43] it you cannot
[1:38:44] educate people into the message
[1:38:49] and we've done a good job down through
[1:38:51] the years
[1:38:52] a man of educating people and bringing
[1:38:55] them to an intellectual knowledge
[1:38:58] but it'll never take the place of a real
[1:39:00] new birth
[1:39:02] where it changes you from the inside out
[1:39:05] and you're not conforming to a church
[1:39:08] and it's society but you are conforming
[1:39:11] to christ and his word
[1:39:13] coming into his image
[1:39:17] amen he says our church
[1:39:20] is also the catholic universal church
[1:39:24] catholic means universal which is a
[1:39:27] universal belief for all believers
[1:39:30] one of them is born of the spirit of god
[1:39:32] and has the holy spirit in it
[1:39:34] and it proves it by its life doctrine
[1:39:36] and action
[1:39:37] that the holy spirit is there because
[1:39:40] it's the comforter that christ
[1:39:42] promised working in his church doing the
[1:39:45] same thing
[1:39:46] that he did at the beginning that's how
[1:39:49] the antitoxin of christ's salvation work
[1:39:52] in the beginning that's the way it works
[1:39:53] today brings forth the same thing
[1:39:56] one is made up of a one is an
[1:39:58] intellectual conception
[1:40:00] of a denomination made up by a group of
[1:40:02] men which has a form of godliness as the
[1:40:05] prophet told us
[1:40:06] and deny this truth of power now that's
[1:40:09] just as plain as i know how to make it
[1:40:11] now there's two church one of them born
[1:40:14] that nicea
[1:40:15] and the other born at pentecost one
[1:40:18] has always been against the other we've
[1:40:21] been down to the
[1:40:22] church jesus to prove it one's against
[1:40:24] the other ones to find dignified
[1:40:26] intellectual church with fine scholars
[1:40:28] and so forth and the other
[1:40:30] is class a bunch of holy rollers
[1:40:36] amen i wonder where so about some of
[1:40:38] these message
[1:40:39] people that can't be classed anymore is
[1:40:42] holy rose
[1:40:46] it was at the beginning drunk illiterate
[1:40:49] fisherman
[1:40:51] and it's the same thing today it's still
[1:40:53] classed in the same category
[1:40:56] one of them is a scientific arrangement
[1:40:58] the other is a spiritual discernment of
[1:41:01] the word
[1:41:02] one is scientifically a reign with one
[1:41:04] groups of men
[1:41:06] says intellectual bishop the other is
[1:41:08] absolutely
[1:41:09] born of the spirit of god and lives by
[1:41:12] the spirit of god
[1:41:13] and it performs and makes to come to
[1:41:15] pass the words that god promised
[1:41:18] it shows what anatoxin you're taking
[1:41:20] have you taken
[1:41:22] educational toxin have you got the holy
[1:41:25] spirit anti-toxin
[1:41:26] oh that subtleness of satan
[1:41:30] how he can paint that picture and
[1:41:33] intellectually can make a man that's not
[1:41:35] born of the spirit of god just turn
[1:41:37] around and around
[1:41:39] and there's no way intellectually to
[1:41:41] down with them
[1:41:42] them with it there's not a way it's a
[1:41:44] discernment by faith see discernment
[1:41:47] we see what the word says then you say
[1:41:50] brother branham they say they have
[1:41:52] discernment then let
[1:41:54] the holy spirit produce what he promised
[1:41:57] to produce and then we'll believe it
[1:42:01] see there's the evidence of it now how
[1:42:03] did the antitoxin act
[1:42:05] when it struck the person these signs
[1:42:09] shall follow them that believe he said
[1:42:12] well if the antitoxins struck that
[1:42:15] then that's all right amen brother that
[1:42:19] is that's
[1:42:20] it we've got to have an anatoxin that
[1:42:22] produ
[1:42:23] protects us against the poison of the
[1:42:25] venom
[1:42:27] of the snake of the serpent
[1:42:32] now you see
[1:42:36] we're not to put a question on the word
[1:42:37] of god we're to believe it
[1:42:40] because when the church puts a question
[1:42:42] upon the word
[1:42:44] is he the same
[1:42:48] does he still live in his church
[1:42:51] and perform his signs and miracles
[1:42:55] that he did when he was on earth which
[1:42:57] he surely
[1:42:58] he so surely promised us in john 14 12.
[1:43:03] now i'm not even going to read you a
[1:43:04] quote today that ain't from in
[1:43:06] in this part that ain't from 63 forward
[1:43:11] after the seals are open and i want you
[1:43:14] to see where he's focusing
[1:43:16] he that believeth on me the works that i
[1:43:20] do shall he do also and
[1:43:22] greater than these shall you do and if i
[1:43:25] go to my father these signs shall follow
[1:43:27] them that believe shall follow them
[1:43:29] the question is to the people today does
[1:43:32] he
[1:43:32] really mean it and when you accept what
[1:43:35] the church says does he really mean it
[1:43:37] then you put yourself in the same
[1:43:39] condition
[1:43:40] that adam did and you join yourself with
[1:43:43] the woman
[1:43:44] of the church of the world and separate
[1:43:47] yourself
[1:43:47] from the blessings that god has promised
[1:43:50] to every believer that would separate
[1:43:52] himself
[1:43:52] from the world to the word
[1:43:56] so here we are we're here in the most
[1:43:58] evil age that there's ever been
[1:44:01] amen amen we're full of knowledge
[1:44:05] education unbelief
[1:44:08] and insanity
[1:44:11] amen have you ever seen an age that's so
[1:44:14] insane
[1:44:16] my god have mercy amen
[1:44:19] you know it is a it is a time of of
[1:44:22] insanity people have lost their bearing
[1:44:26] they've lost their balance but
[1:44:29] you know it's in this kind of time that
[1:44:32] god
[1:44:32] is determined that he's going to bring a
[1:44:36] people in his image
[1:44:37] [Music]
[1:44:38] amen now why has god determined to bring
[1:44:41] a bride to completion here
[1:44:43] why would god call or use this time to
[1:44:46] call the people
[1:44:48] out of this evil age for his namesake
[1:44:50] the reason is
[1:44:52] to try the bride amen we've got to show
[1:44:56] who's going to stand
[1:44:57] and who's going to bend or who's going
[1:44:59] to bow
[1:45:01] there daniel today is there some hebrew
[1:45:04] children
[1:45:05] is there a david that would fly in the
[1:45:07] face of goliath
[1:45:08] and said we're not putting up with the
[1:45:09] uncircumcised
[1:45:11] of the philistines challenging the
[1:45:14] servants of the living god
[1:45:15] is there somebody a man who would
[1:45:19] who would stand and be proven
[1:45:22] in this day and time
[1:45:26] whatever seed was planted that's what's
[1:45:28] to come up
[1:45:30] we're seeing seeds of deceit and we're
[1:45:32] seeing seeds of
[1:45:34] the weak word of god just as the seed of
[1:45:37] the church fell back there with signs
[1:45:39] and wonders
[1:45:41] and the living christ among them it ends
[1:45:43] in the last days
[1:45:44] under the ministry of malachi 4 and
[1:45:46] restore
[1:45:47] restores and get back again the original
[1:45:50] faith

[1:45:55] agents to prove to satan

[1:46:00] of woman

[1:46:09] the word
[1:46:10] and and she believed every bit but just

[1:46:47] promise
[1:46:48] that christ is still the same that he's
[1:46:51] still here in power
[1:46:53] that he's still here in his glory that
[1:46:55] he's here in his bride form to do what

[1:51:43] to be
[1:51:44] to a real son and daughter of god who's
[1:51:46] mature

[1:54:00] eternal life
[1:54:01] his own life is in us and man that's the
[1:54:04] only way you can have
[1:54:05] eternal life has had the very life of
[1:54:08] jesus christ on the inside of you
[1:54:10] where god separated himself and gave us
[1:54:13] his spirit like he did on the day of
[1:54:15] pentecost
[1:54:17] amen and through this the mind of christ
[1:54:20] ought to be operating among
[1:54:22] us the holy ghost the spirit of jesus
[1:54:25] moving in your life now somebody in this
[1:54:29] day is going to accept

[1:56:16] was anointed and have his anointed be of
[1:56:18] his flesh be of his bone

[1:56:28] how god anointed jesus of nazareth
[1:56:34] with the holy ghost and with power
[1:56:39] that words left with among with too many
[1:56:42] people
[1:56:43] power who went about doing good

[1:57:10] and power god hates a powerless religion
[1:57:16] come on god hates it when a church is so
[1:57:19] dead there's not even a shout
[1:57:21] not even an amen anymore not even a
[1:57:23] glory to god
[1:57:25] when it's been years that there's there
[1:57:27] hadn't been a miriam dance
[1:57:29] in the church
[1:57:32] hallelujah we'd have played the rest of
[1:57:34] that on february the 18th
[1:57:36] 2018 and i was singing glory to his name
[1:57:39] and got into leaning on the everlasting
[1:57:42] arm
[1:57:42] and out of the mezzanine came sister
[1:57:45] lana
[1:57:46] a little frail cancer-eating mother
[1:57:49] a man who the doctors had said was dying
[1:57:52] with a
[1:57:53] cancer amen but dare she come out of
[1:57:56] that mezzanine
[1:57:57] and dance all around this building with
[1:58:00] the miriam dance
[1:58:03] hallelujah and there at the pulpit we
[1:58:06] declared
[1:58:07] your enemy is dead your enemy is dead
[1:58:11] and she goes back the next day healed
[1:58:14] and they have to testify you're a healed
[1:58:18] woman
[1:58:19] and we don't know what happened and it
[1:58:21] wasn't our medicine
[1:58:22] this has never happened before that's
[1:58:25] what they thought
[1:58:26] but it's happened before and it'll
[1:58:29] happen again
[1:58:30] [Applause]
[1:58:32] hallelujah you know why because
[1:58:35] god is the god of the miraculous he is a
[1:58:38] god of miracles
[1:58:41] all down through the bible he worked
[1:58:43] miracles
[1:58:44] it was a miracle when he opened up the
[1:58:46] red sea
[1:58:47] it was a miracle when he called dirt and
[1:58:50] made them naps and flies
[1:58:51] it was a miracle when he turned water
[1:58:53] into blood
[1:58:54] [Applause]
[1:58:57] it was a miracle when a fish swallowed
[1:58:59] jonah
[1:59:00] that was created by god that was a
[1:59:03] miracle
[1:59:04] of creation that swallowed jonah
[1:59:08] and spit him out on dry land our god is
[1:59:12] a god of the miraculous
[1:59:14] you have been asked to believe in the
[1:59:16] miraculous
[1:59:17] amen if you don't believe in the
[1:59:19] miraculous how in the world you think
[1:59:20] there's going to be a rapture
[1:59:22] where you're going to be standing on
[1:59:23] your feet and be changed in a moment and
[1:59:26] a twinkling of an eye
[1:59:27] and gray hair cut back the right color
[1:59:29] again
[1:59:30] glasses fall off and all the other
[1:59:32] things are gone
[1:59:33] because why the miraculous has been done
[1:59:39] and god showed us over and over and over
[1:59:41] he's a god of miracles
[1:59:45] listen where do we have come down to the
[1:59:47] ages courageous faith

[2:00:01] sacrifice anointed those in the dark
[2:00:03] ages
[2:00:04] and they gave their lives willingly so
[2:00:06] how could that do it how could
[2:00:08] a father do it a mother do it and watch
[2:00:10] their babies be killed in front of them
[2:00:12] and then
[2:00:12] their eyes put out or their their dip
[2:00:15] their hair
[2:00:15] dipped in tar and burn how could they do
[2:00:18] it
[2:00:19] spirit of the ox amen spirit of
[2:00:22] sacrifice
[2:00:23] amen comes and moves into the
[2:00:25] intelligence of a man
[2:00:28] is that right oh man the gutenberg press
[2:00:30] comes along puts the bible in
[2:00:32] in written form amen man using
[2:00:36] intelligence defeated the romans

[2:00:41] is that right amen god use the
[2:00:44] intelligence of a man but i want you to
[2:00:46] know
[2:00:46] today is eagle anointing
[2:00:48] [Music]
[2:00:50] amen oh hallelujah i mean when we come
[2:00:54] down to it there are people that have
[2:00:56] great the tenacious faith courageous
[2:00:59] faith that lays a hold on a promise
[2:01:02] and lying like anointing gets a hold of
[2:01:05] that promise
[2:01:06] and won't let it go
[2:01:10] you ever see a lion take its prey it'll
[2:01:12] it'll take it and choke it to death
[2:01:15] you took them all them old them all
[2:01:18] apostles there and that day with their
[2:01:19] courageous faith they

[2:01:35] diseases
[2:01:37] even in death we're not defeated these
[2:01:39] all died in faith
[2:01:41] god uses the intelligence of a man and
[2:01:43] got to use doctors in medicine
[2:01:46] come on he will do it but i want you to
[2:01:49] know that's not our anointing
[2:01:52] amen our anointing is the miracle
[2:01:56] the third pool was a miracle come on
[2:01:59] spoken word bad tumors vanish spoken
[2:02:03] word
[2:02:03] fish resurrected spoken word squirrels
[2:02:06] created spoken word
[2:02:07] stones moved out into out of existence
[2:02:12] amen what was it miracle miracle miracle
[2:02:15] miracle
[2:02:16] the rapture is going to be a miracle
[2:02:19] standing on your feet you'll see the
[2:02:21] dead in christ rise and come to you
[2:02:24] and that all of a sudden you will be
[2:02:26] changed
[2:02:27] to be like them and you'll be caught up
[2:02:30] to meet him in the air
[2:02:31] we still believe in the rapture we still
[2:02:34] believe in the click catching up
[2:02:37] so brother tim we're already in the
[2:02:39] rapture i'll give you that we've heard
[2:02:40] the shout and we are the voice
[2:02:43] but there's still going to be his coming
[2:02:45] where we'll meet him in the air
[2:02:49] so well ever i won't see him but no but
[2:02:51] mine will
[2:02:53] and i ain't worried about everybody
[2:02:55] else's eyes seeing him i just want to
[2:02:58] see
[2:03:00] because when i see him we shall be like
[2:03:02] him
[2:03:03] for we shall see him as he is
[2:03:08] we're under the eagle anointing the
[2:03:10] eagle snatches his prey
[2:03:13] right down there you know and then
[2:03:15] snatches and you know
[2:03:16] the eagle of all of those the lion is an
[2:03:19] earth

[2:03:23] earth dwelling animal a a um an ox he's
[2:03:26] earth dwelling
[2:03:27] but the eagle is specified flying eagle
[2:03:32] as i've often said he's not a sitting
[2:03:33] duck
[2:03:35] we're not going to be as sickened up for
[2:03:37] the devil to take down
[2:03:39] we're a flying eagle and the eagle is
[2:03:41] the only one of them that don't have to
[2:03:43] worry about crossing the river
[2:03:47] hallelujah hey man you don't have to
[2:03:49] worry about building a bridge or taking
[2:03:51] a boat or doing this without to get
[2:03:53] across the river
[2:03:54] he just lifts his wing into the ramen
[2:03:56] place and he flies
[2:03:58] he flies right over the river between
[2:04:02] the natural and the supernatural
[2:04:04] where all things are possible to them
[2:04:06] that believe
[2:04:11] god called you to be eagles in this day
[2:04:13] to believe in the miraculous
[2:04:16] snatch you right out of your troubles
[2:04:20] in the nick of time
[2:04:25] hallelujah god's got him a masterpiece
[2:04:30] you are god's masterpiece
[2:04:34] god's gotten my masterpiece for nearly 4
[2:04:36] 000 years god's been making himself a
[2:04:38] masterpiece
[2:04:41] there there jesus was a fulfillment the
[2:04:45] masterpiece of the old testament
[2:04:48] but at calvary of peace come off of him
[2:04:51] you know that just as when when
[2:04:54] adam was laid down out of him was taken
[2:04:57] the the rib the parson to make his wife
[2:05:01] at calvary god did the same he took a
[2:05:03] portion out of christ
[2:05:05] the water the blood and the spirit
[2:05:08] those were the three elements that came
[2:05:10] out of christ
[2:05:12] amen what was that for to make a bride
[2:05:15] she
[2:05:15] she has she is of his water baptizing
[2:05:19] his name
[2:05:20] blood sanctified and cleansed by the
[2:05:22] blood and receives the holy ghost
[2:05:24] justification sanctification and baptism
[2:05:27] of the holy ghost
[2:05:28] is that right amen that's the bride but
[2:05:31] you know
[2:05:32] she's at peace that was struck off of
[2:05:34] him at calvary
[2:05:35] that came out of him and as the groom
[2:05:38] fulfilled the old testament this bride
[2:05:40] fulfills the new testament
[2:05:43] you've got quite a calling to do you're
[2:05:46] to fulfill the new testament
[2:05:48] and all the new testament speaks of this
[2:05:52] hour
[2:05:54] hallelujah jesus christ speaks of this
[2:05:57] hour
[2:05:58] amen oh my do you do you realize friends
[2:06:01] this
[2:06:02] is where we're at we're in the we're in
[2:06:04] the day and hour where
[2:06:05] the that the same word that spoke
[2:06:08] of the groom it also speaks of the bride
[2:06:13] can you say man this is what brother
[2:06:15] branham said and
[2:06:16] it is the rise of the son the same word
[2:06:19] that spoke of the groom it speaks also
[2:06:22] of the bride
[2:06:24] oh my your people who have been
[2:06:28] prophesied
[2:06:30] now we realize revival for the world is
[2:06:32] over
[2:06:34] i said for the world but that don't mean
[2:06:37] we can't have revival
[2:06:39] that don't mean you as an individual
[2:06:41] can't be revived
[2:06:43] that don't mean that you have to go
[2:06:45] along in cold old dirty
[2:06:47] laodicea and swooped down and carried
[2:06:49] down by the world
[2:06:51] and and it's cares come on amen
[2:06:54] there ought to be a holy power
[2:06:57] surrounding in that church
[2:06:58] that'll make demons flee the principal
[2:07:02] work
[2:07:02] of the church is to cast out devils
[2:07:06] that's what salvation is is casting out
[2:07:08] devils
[2:07:09] that's what healing the sick is is
[2:07:11] casting out devils
[2:07:13] and when the church loses the power to
[2:07:15] cast out devils she's a backslidden
[2:07:17] church
[2:07:21] when that's no longer her emphasis she's
[2:07:23] a backslidden church we've made a
[2:07:26] revelation oh we call it revelation it
[2:07:28] ain't nothing but
[2:07:29] carnal in in uh
[2:07:32] carnal uh intellectualism
[2:07:36] and that's all it is we're calling it
[2:07:38] revelation real revelation gives you
[2:07:40] stimulation
[2:07:42] real level revelation is quickening
[2:07:43] power real revelation amen
[2:07:46] what make you act like they did on the
[2:07:47] day of pentecost
[2:07:51] hallelujah amen
[2:07:54] there ought to be a holy power that are
[2:07:57] surrounded
[2:07:58] and in the church that will make demons
[2:08:00] flee i'm quoting from
[2:08:02] 63 11 17. amen instead of that
[2:08:06] it's become a laughingstock what is it
[2:08:10] the mechanics instead
[2:08:13] of the dynamics
[2:08:16] oh my we're working on it working on it
[2:08:19] and working on it and reworking on it
[2:08:21] and we
[2:08:22] we're working on we've got it all i'll
[2:08:24] tell you what
[2:08:26] we've seen message preachers take this
[2:08:28] message apart
[2:08:29] and put parts here and there and you
[2:08:32] know hook
[2:08:32] quotes together and next thing you know
[2:08:35] we lose
[2:08:36] the true oneness of god that brother
[2:08:38] branham preached
[2:08:42] there is a true oneness come on
[2:08:45] other yeah we know there is a false
[2:08:47] oneness but there is a true oneness
[2:08:50] amen i'll just tell you this there ain't
[2:08:52] no two lords
[2:08:54] there's one lord one faith one baptism
[2:08:56] one god and one father of us all
[2:08:58] but we've had some quack mechanics that
[2:09:00] want to try
[2:09:01] to tinker with the church until the
[2:09:03] church can't run
[2:09:05] in the power of the holy ghost anymore
[2:09:07] of the backslidden people are sitting on
[2:09:09] the pew
[2:09:10] until our children don't know the god
[2:09:15] that we're supposed to know in his
[2:09:17] life-changing power
[2:09:24] oh yeah
[2:09:28] brother branham told us the supreme that
[2:09:31] that
[2:09:32] that you cannot get to first base
[2:09:35] unless you believe in the supreme deity
[2:09:38] of the lord jesus christ
[2:09:48] so we get it we mess with the mechanics
[2:09:51] to the car won't even run and there's no
[2:09:54] dynamics
[2:09:55] to make it move
[2:09:58] oh yeah and brother brandon said and i'm
[2:10:02] quoting again
[2:10:04] and he says our educational system
[2:10:07] our denominational system has taken the
[2:10:10] place
[2:10:10] of the holy spirit leading the church
[2:10:14] our great fine training of ministers and
[2:10:17] things has taken the place
[2:10:19] of all night prayer meetings
[2:10:26] oh yeah and the old-time way we used to
[2:10:28] get to god
[2:10:30] i told you i'm reading i'm reading see
[2:10:32] i'm reading from 63.
[2:10:34] now instead of having preachers we got
[2:10:36] lectures
[2:10:38] men who knows the word just as well and
[2:10:40] they can sit there and put it together
[2:10:41] in such a way that's
[2:10:43] astounding how they do it can do it they
[2:10:45] know the mechanics but that ain't the
[2:10:47] dynamics
[2:10:48] we want to we want the dynamics i don't
[2:10:51] care about the mechanics
[2:10:53] i want to know the dynamics what does it
[2:10:55] do
[2:10:56] i don't know how that car runs out there
[2:10:58] it's got pistons and cylinders i don't
[2:11:00] know how much pressure you use
[2:11:02] the only thing i know is that dynamics
[2:11:03] put her out there and drive it
[2:11:05] and that's what we know god made the
[2:11:08] promise
[2:11:09] i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh
[2:11:13] your sons and your daughters shall
[2:11:14] prophesy how is he going to do it i
[2:11:16] can't tell you
[2:11:17] i just know want to know the dynamics of
[2:11:20] god's system
[2:11:22] that's the main thing what shall i do
[2:11:25] with jesus called christ he says let me
[2:11:27] say something
[2:11:29] this uniting time and we see them we see
[2:11:31] them uniting all these
[2:11:32] coming out these spirits that are moving
[2:11:35] uniting together
[2:11:37] gonna change you know you're gonna
[2:11:39] change the
[2:11:40] the whole nation we see spirits that are
[2:11:42] loose
[2:11:43] you're not but it's uniting time for for
[2:11:46] god and his bride too he says i say this
[2:11:49] with
[2:11:50] reverence and respect i believe the
[2:11:52] bride of christ is called
[2:11:54] i believe she's sealed in the kingdom of
[2:11:56] god i believe the mechanics is there
[2:12:00] come on they're waiting for the dynamics
[2:12:03] that they take her off the earth into
[2:12:04] glory
[2:12:05] in the rapture i believe it with all my
[2:12:07] heart yes sir we don't know how he's
[2:12:09] going to do it
[2:12:10] but he shall do it he is the dynamics
[2:12:13] and we just become members of the
[2:12:15] machine of his body
[2:12:16] forming ourselves into his image and see
[2:12:19] him uniting himself with us
[2:12:21] in his works with his love gifts as he
[2:12:23] hands them to us just before the wedding
[2:12:25] supper
[2:12:26] and we're waiting watching for that
[2:12:28] their big
[2:12:29] church is to be united the dynamics of
[2:12:32] this church
[2:12:34] will be anybody ready for this
[2:12:37] a refilling yes of the holy spirit
[2:12:41] that we have worked in a small measure
[2:12:44] while the headstone is coming down to
[2:12:46] unite with the body
[2:12:47] but when that head and that body unites
[2:12:49] together the full power of the holy
[2:12:51] ghost will raise her up
[2:12:52] exactly like that even the dead that's
[2:12:54] dead in christ for hundreds of years
[2:12:56] will rise in the beauty of his holiness
[2:12:58] and take a flight to the skies
[2:13:01] the dynamics is the holy spirit
[2:13:03] [Music]
[2:13:05] the dynamics of this church will be a
[2:13:07] refilling
[2:13:09] amen you need it i need it
[2:13:12] even the prophet said he needs it
[2:13:16] amen we all need it amen and amen
[2:13:21] there it is we got china russia
[2:13:25] north korea they're all threatened
[2:13:27] getting ready to pour out destruction
[2:13:30] rumbling every day they're getting ready
[2:13:33] to cleanse this earth before the
[2:13:34] millennium
[2:13:36] with atomic fire amen they're going to
[2:13:39] pour out
[2:13:40] atomic fire on the earth read your bible
[2:13:43] and you'll see it
[2:13:44] amen but there has to be another
[2:13:46] outboard
[2:13:50] amen i said there has to be another
[2:13:52] outpouring
[2:13:53] in the world falling apart brother
[2:13:55] branham said the hour that we're living
[2:13:57] oh god the world is falling apart
[2:13:59] that hangs in the hangers bombs hangs
[2:14:02] the things that will do
[2:14:03] it just exactly the church is ready
[2:14:06] she's sealed in
[2:14:07] ready to come there will be a big
[2:14:09] outpouring of the spirit yes sir
[2:14:12] to grab that church and take her into
[2:14:14] the skies
[2:14:15] exactly because the church the word the
[2:14:18] bride and his ministry
[2:14:20] christ is ministry is in the bride which
[2:14:22] is body the supernatural body spiritual
[2:14:25] body
[2:14:25] of his here on the earth and his spirit
[2:14:28] is sit there
[2:14:29] living his life right out until him and
[2:14:31] the church becomes one in the wedding
[2:14:34] hallelujah big outpouring
[2:14:38] and you're in the middle of it
[2:14:43] hallelujah you're in the middle of it
[2:14:46] amen that's what's happening right now
[2:14:49] you're in the middle of it
[2:14:52] oh yeah we can look out here we can see
[2:14:54] what's happening
[2:14:55] where a demon invisible demon is coming
[2:14:58] into this round
[2:14:59] and people are scared and running
[2:15:01] shutting down schools and churches and
[2:15:03] homes and and business and everything
[2:15:05] and wrecking the economy
[2:15:07] with an invisible demon but i want you
[2:15:09] to know there's somebody greater
[2:15:13] and i saw another mighty angel
[2:15:16] amen he has come down from the heavens
[2:15:19] and he put his foot on the land under
[2:15:21] the sea and say
[2:15:22] satan you cannot rise until i take my
[2:15:25] bride out of here
[2:15:28] hallelujah oh church don't be afraid
[2:15:31] don't be worried i see another mighty
[2:15:34] angel
[2:15:34] we see what the devil's doing we see the
[2:15:37] enemy at work
[2:15:38] we see his attack on our homes and our
[2:15:40] family but i see another mighty angel
[2:15:44] hallelujah only christ it could be
[2:15:54] can i tell you for the last 50 years
[2:15:56] we've had an outpouring of the mechanics
[2:15:59] but if there isn't a dynamic spark to
[2:16:02] ignite the gas it might as well be water
[2:16:05] you can say brother tim this with this
[2:16:07] theology we've got we've got message
[2:16:09] theology in this
[2:16:11] it's got oh my it's octane is so high
[2:16:14] it's indescribable but what good is all
[2:16:16] your word word word
[2:16:17] that you poured into the church it's
[2:16:20] just theology
[2:16:21] until the holy ghost comes about it and
[2:16:24] quickens it
[2:16:28] that'll bring you in harmony with the
[2:16:29] word that'll bring you in
[2:16:31] harmony with christ a people that has
[2:16:35] his potential amen
[2:16:38] but what god's looking for today is
[2:16:40] somebody that'll call him on the scene
[2:16:43] he can't work until you begin to cry
[2:16:47] oh brother tim that's pentecostal well
[2:16:49] that's what brother branham told us
[2:16:51] in seed not air with the shuck and
[2:16:53] jeffersonville in 1965
[2:16:55] he said we have become like buzzards
[2:16:59] vulturing down on past manna
[2:17:02] and we don't know how to fly in the
[2:17:04] heavens anymore
[2:17:06] where all things are possible to them
[2:17:08] that believe
[2:17:11] come on amen and he said there's no more
[2:17:15] prayer meetings no agonizing with god to
[2:17:17] fulfill his word
[2:17:20] the church has become soft and lazy they
[2:17:22] just want it handed to them
[2:17:25] it's time that people begin to call on
[2:17:27] god
[2:17:28] amen begin to say god move on the scene
[2:17:32] we're here in the last age the last time
[2:17:35] and man
[2:17:35] trouble is all around us everything is
[2:17:38] uncertain more than it ever has been
[2:17:40] and it's time for people to have passion
[2:17:44] to have a desire god i want you more
[2:17:46] than i've ever had you
[2:17:48] i want you moving and i miss amen i want
[2:17:51] you
[2:17:51] living in our church i want you healing
[2:17:53] or sick i want you to save the lost
[2:17:56] [Applause]
[2:17:59] we're so backslidden we don't even know
[2:18:01] what an altar call is anymore
[2:18:06] one of the very last things that brother
[2:18:08] branham said before he left and
[2:18:09] leadership was
[2:18:10] i want an old-fashioned altar called
[2:18:12] here
[2:18:13] ain't not sure he was against the altar
[2:18:15] call of patting someone on the back and
[2:18:17] saying your mother died
[2:18:18] don't you remember you know and and
[2:18:20] getting them on an emotional thing sure
[2:18:22] that's what he was against remember he
[2:18:25] said the way i got it so we i got down
[2:18:27] the altar and they beat me on the back
[2:18:28] till something happened
[2:18:31] i mean why don't we balance some things
[2:18:32] out anymore
[2:18:34] and realize friends an old-fashioned
[2:18:36] altar needs to come back to the
[2:18:38] church with some real repentance and a
[2:18:40] calling on god
[2:18:41] i'm tired of being lukewarm i'm to be in
[2:18:44] your image
[2:18:45] for the bride will not be lukewarm she
[2:18:48] will be passionate about the word
[2:18:50] and passing it for god
[2:18:52] [Applause]
[2:18:54] amen when you hear of others being
[2:18:56] filled with the holy ghost
[2:18:58] it ought to put a burden in your heart i
[2:19:00] want him
[2:19:01] amen don't pass me by you hear that he's
[2:19:04] filling others with the holy ghost
[2:19:06] you ought to be saying god refill me
[2:19:08] [Applause]
[2:19:11] oh we want to take our little eaglets
[2:19:13] and help him out of the shell
[2:19:15] you know help him crack the shell a
[2:19:17] little just say brother branham's a
[2:19:18] prophet
[2:19:19] just say i believe all the seals are
[2:19:21] open and they are
[2:19:22] and and you know just say uh you know
[2:19:25] you bleed the message and we do
[2:19:31] but that ain't nothing more than a billy
[2:19:33] graham intellectual
[2:19:36] easy believism amen you need a dine out
[2:19:40] to sin
[2:19:42] not coming back to calvary and dying out
[2:19:45] to the old man
[2:19:46] and be born anew by the holy spirit
[2:19:49] come on that's exactly right
[2:19:54] amen oh
[2:19:57] you know brother branham said this let
[2:19:59] me just let me say this
[2:20:01] politics this is seed not air with the
[2:20:04] shock
[2:20:04] politics voting in voting out saying
[2:20:07] this now the other and the holy spirit
[2:20:09] has no more right away in the church
[2:20:10] than nothing
[2:20:11] can you imagine i heard that one church
[2:20:14] actually
[2:20:15] voted on whether the seventh seal was
[2:20:17] opened
[2:20:19] how ridiculous is that what if you voted
[2:20:22] it wasn't open did that close it
[2:20:28] amen even if you voted it was open did
[2:20:30] that open it
[2:20:32] no you know it doesn't change what god
[2:20:34] did in our generation
[2:20:37] if the seventh seal is not open the
[2:20:39] seventh angel meant nothing to brother
[2:20:41] brown
[2:20:43] amen you know i know there's a couple of
[2:20:45] quotes that says god wouldn't permit the
[2:20:47] seventh seal to be open
[2:20:49] and brother branham thought he had said
[2:20:51] too much about the third pull because
[2:20:53] god had told him i'll just say nothing
[2:20:55] enough so he went to motel the next day
[2:20:57] after
[2:20:58] preaching on the seventh seal and record
[2:21:00] a new ending to keep it ambiguous
[2:21:02] but after his death william branham
[2:21:04] evangelistic association released
[2:21:06] the original seventh seal and did you
[2:21:10] know there is over a hundred times he
[2:21:11] says
[2:21:12] all the seven seals are open
[2:21:15] over a hundred times all of them are
[2:21:17] open
[2:21:19] the seven seal was the breaking of the
[2:21:21] silence
[2:21:22] we're not in the days of the silence
[2:21:24] anymore
[2:21:26] we have heard what the seven thunders
[2:21:28] uttered what were the seven thunders
[2:21:30] they were not the virtues they were
[2:21:32] the revelations contained in the seven
[2:21:34] seals
[2:21:35] that's what the thunders were about
[2:21:39] amen we know now what it was god hid it
[2:21:42] in symbols and he's now revealed it
[2:21:44] why to be to usher in the coming of the
[2:21:47] lord
[2:21:47] to hand you an open book amen so that
[2:21:51] you could see
[2:21:53] so you can see what you possess as a
[2:21:55] child of god
[2:21:57] amen now
[2:22:01] now of course you see the the seven
[2:22:04] thunders brought us
[2:22:06] we can't begin with the word coming to a
[2:22:08] prophet
[2:22:09] the shout and now we're we're here where
[2:22:11] the seventh angel has
[2:22:13] sounded his message he's done his job
[2:22:17] he ran his course amen
[2:22:20] and it's now the days where it's the
[2:22:23] voice
[2:22:24] of the archangel which is christ come on
[2:22:27] amen and there is a bride here in his
[2:22:30] image
[2:22:31] who under their messenger is the final
[2:22:34] voice to the final age where the word
[2:22:36] that was preached
[2:22:37] is now taken on flesh hallelujah
[2:22:41] and it's produced a bride in his image
[2:22:45] and they are the voice of the
[2:22:47] resurrection
[2:22:48] i was dead in the tombs of darkness and
[2:22:51] the tombs of religion
[2:22:53] but now i am alive forevermore and
[2:22:56] you'll never
[2:22:56] seal me back in a denomination again
[2:22:59] hallelujah i once was dead but now i'm
[2:23:02] alive
[2:23:03] is that your testimony this morning then
[2:23:06] you are the voice of the resurrected one
[2:23:08] and the voice of his power and in his
[2:23:12] resurrection there's healing
[2:23:14] deliverance and salvation hallelujah and
[2:23:18] our little eagles can pip their way out
[2:23:21] of the shell
[2:23:22] you don't have to help them out with a
[2:23:23] lecture amen are given a little
[2:23:26] instruction
[2:23:26] or some kind of intellectual conception
[2:23:29] but they'll knock on that shell
[2:23:31] they've got a little hammer beef and
[2:23:33] they hear the lord will
[2:23:34] we will sing god i want that salvation
[2:23:37] they hear
[2:23:38] i'm the lord that jesus i want that
[2:23:40] healing for my soul lord
[2:23:42] i want you to deliver and they begin to
[2:23:44] peck their way out
[2:23:46] they get a little fresh breath of air
[2:23:48] brother it just
[2:23:50] makes them even peck a little harder
[2:23:53] amen i believe we're getting the fresh
[2:23:54] breath of air
[2:23:56] it ought to make every one of you push
[2:23:58] out push out against the world push out
[2:24:00] against some belief
[2:24:07] brother adams once on to say in this
[2:24:10] quote i was reading
[2:24:11] about voting and he says
[2:24:15] no more prayer meetings no more
[2:24:17] agonizing with god to fulfill his word
[2:24:20] no more believing that the word is still
[2:24:22] the same yesterday today and forever
[2:24:24] they just vulturized down
[2:24:27] a denomination put their name on the
[2:24:29] book that's lazy and soft set back
[2:24:32] they're gloating
[2:24:34] on some kind of dead carrion
[2:24:37] supposed to be at least a hawk or
[2:24:39] similar brother to the eagle
[2:24:41] the prophet that brought the true word
[2:24:43] and manifested it
[2:24:44] relies on half-rotten man-made theology
[2:24:48] words to get it some man-made sunday
[2:24:51] school program sheet
[2:24:53] some educator killed for him back in
[2:24:55] some seminary somewhere
[2:24:58] you know we're not happy with the way
[2:24:59] the prophet brought it so we got to
[2:25:00] write our own books
[2:25:03] are you with me amen we got to have our
[2:25:05] own messages
[2:25:07] amen tell them the days of miracles pass
[2:25:10] there's no such thing as the baptism of
[2:25:12] the holy ghost all this nonsense you
[2:25:14] mean you can tell me that an eagle would
[2:25:16] eat that
[2:25:17] he couldn't do it neither will a
[2:25:20] christian eat on a dead
[2:25:22] carry him from that old denominational
[2:25:24] doctrines
[2:25:25] they want the fresh word of god
[2:25:28] fresh amen the promise of the hour god
[2:25:32] promised
[2:25:32] rabbits in the days of luther he
[2:25:35] promised other things in the days of
