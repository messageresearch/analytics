just want to just want to say it's been an honor to stand here and watch you watch you get your blessings watch you receive the Holy Ghost and I just can't thank the Lord enough there's so many things that we could say about this weekend every service the Lord has just moved and last night was so special and we just thank the Lord and we pray that God restores each and every one of you your strength and and I'm not going to take much of your time today but I do have something that the Lord's really dealt with me about to to speak this morning and I'm not typically this this kind of guy I'm the kind of guy that I want to I want to bring something to you that's that's fresh or new to mine but the Lord's given me some inspiration to to speak to you today I the Lord had dealt with me a few weeks ago I was at a camp in Oklahoma and the Lord had dealt with me to speak on the thought of worship Warriors and uh how many was in that camp there a few of you nah the Lord give me give me some inspiration and uh and I just I'd like to speak to you today I was in this prayer line the Lord dealt with me what to speak to you this morning on worship without shackles worship without shackles and I feel like we've seen some shackles fall off and maybe if you have your Bible this morning we'll turn over the Book of Revelation chapter one and then to chapter five there I want to again thank brother Tim and evening like Tabernacle for inviting us to come and come and be a part of these meetings once again and it's an honor to it's an honor to stand here to watch my dad That was supposed to be an agree by now tell you that Easter is real so I believe that's why I can worship without shackles because Easter proved that the grave didn't have enough you love the Lord this morning before we read brother Branham said in a restoration of the Bright Tree he said that's Easter time he said oh I like Eastern yes sir but there's too much on Easter today about bunny rabbits and ducks and pink chickens and pretty hats and new dresses he said that's not Easter but Easter is the resurrection it's restoring to restore back its God restoring time it's God restoring time you look over you look out over the Earth God is restoring restoring what nature that's right he's restoring the flowers he's restoring the leaves he's restoring the fruit of the field what is it it's God is restoring it's Easter means to bring it back what is it there is a sentence Acclaim Easter crime or the flower claims it has a right to rise again and God's law nature pulls the Earth around and makes the law of God and nature bring forth an Easter a resurrection it's beautiful Revelations chapter 1 and verse 17 and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was deed dead and behold I Am Alive forevermore amen and I have the keys of hell and of death Revelation chapter 5 and verse 8. Revelations chapter 5 and verse 8 and brother Branham little Branham said in Gabriel's instructions to Daniel he said I like to worship don't you and we don't come to church just to hear a sermon that goes with it but we come to church to worship Worship in spirit and in truth you've heard the truth that's the word now to worship is to express yourself to him and Lord spoke to me a little bit ago and he spoke to me said I'll give you everything in life but worship is what we give back to him it's the only thing it's the only thing that he didn't give us that we can give back to him so let's give it back to him Revelations 5 and 8 and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and Four and Twenty Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of saints and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and that's made us unto our God the Kings and Priests let's say that together Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the Beast and the elders and the number of them was ten thousands times ten thousands and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and every creature which is in heaven and on Earth and under the Earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard eyes saying blessing and honor and Glory free and power be unto him that setteth upon the throne and the lamb forever and ever and the four beasts said amen and the Four and Twenty Elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever may God bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord as we said we'd like to speak to you just for a few moments this morning on worship without shackles worship without child girls and Jesus said that he said the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in the truth for the father seeketh such to worship him so we recognize that God is a spirit and they that worship Him have got to worship Him in spirit and in truth and you know good and well that that we serve an amazing God that has filled your life has changed your mind he's he's changed your heart he's changed you he's healed you he's made you whole and he knows how to speak to us upon our current life crisis that we are in and he doesn't speak to us about our problems but he speak to us about his promises and he knows exactly where we are and he knows exactly where he is taking us to he's not taking us under defeat but he is taking us unto completely Victory and he reveals himself in truth so that he can be worshiped in truth so today we are not serving a God that has lied to us and has ever let down on any of his promises but we are worship him a God that knows that he's going to keep his promise he knows that he's not going to let one of them fall and we recognize that we are serving a tangible God a God that can be failed a God that can be seen a God that you've witnessed and you've witnessed him come and touch you this weekend by the power of the Holy Ghost it was him and it came by your way and he touched your heart he's a tangible God and it can be felt by the feeling of our infirmities but I don't want to just talk to you about things of of things that that you've went through and things of your past but I want to speak to you from people that have the keys in their hand and have unlocked the chains off of their life and William Branham would speak from a message of Jeremiah 8 and 22 is there is there any balm and Gilead is there no physician there then why is the health of the daughter of my people why are they not recovered but notice notice he's saying to us that Jeremiah is saying to us why are you going down in there in the foreign lands is there not healing is there not virtuous they're not power right here but notice what brother random said in the message why he said I challenge every person in here to believe that inoculation do you believe it all right all of you believe it then stand upon your feet and receive your healing in the name of Jesus Christ amen he said take your chair he's speaking to somebody in a wheelchair he said take your chair and push it on home now I'm speaking to you in the natural now I'm speaking to you in the spiritual now take your spiritual chair that you came into this camp with that you were bound to and push it on home you're not going to leave here in the same condition that you walked into this campaign you're not going to leave here in the depression and anxiety and the fear and the rebellion and the bitterness take that thing and push it on home he said there she is about out of the chair for the kingdom of God do you believe Glory don't you see he's here the inoculation the bomb is here glory to God believe it friends don't be afraid to trust him Hallelujah where's your faith you feel different don't you sister you take your old wheelchair now and you go home and be well don't you doubt don't you doubt you just keep the same faith that you got you keep the same faith that you got the faith that got you out of the chair is the faith that'll keep you out of the chair the faith that got you out of your depression the faith that made you get in this line last night the faith that made you raise your hand and say Amen to the word of God is the faith that'll take you home is the faith that'll give you an overcoming life it's the faith that'll give you the victory don't go back to the shackles don't go back to the prison house don't go back to where the devil wants you to live at you stay right there when God destined you to be he didn't Destin you to be pound he destined you to be free he destined you to have your Liberty it depends on what you're looking at this morning I'm not looking at my problems I'm not looking at my situations I'm not looking at what I feel but I'm looking at the promises of God and the promises of God are yes and amen and I'm not going to worship Him from a mindset of being bound I'm going to worship Him from Freedom I'm going to worship Him in Liberty I'm going to worship Him in Victory I'm going to worship Him in spirit I'm going to worship Him in truth not bail this morning the blood is set you free fear is rolled off of your life suicide is rolled up of your life pincers wrote off of your life depressions rolled off of your life is there anybody in the house of God that knows what it's like to be free then give God some praise [Applause] you're not worshiping from where you was you worship from where you're going and you are going to a place where no devil has got a hold on you fear ain't got to hold on you suicide ain't got a hold on you the Rapture is your goal worship is our weapon praise is what we give to God but God is our Victory God is our shout God is our dance God is our praise let me tell you Church you are not worshiping a dead God the tomb is empty this morning the tomb is empty and it gives you the faith to recognize that you're an overcomer in this generation brother Burnham said in letting off the pressure he said now that you have confessed your sins now you that have confessed your sins now that you believe do you believe that you've beat every shackle off of your understanding and the church said hey amen amen amen amen amen do you believe that you beat all the shackles off of your understanding and that nothing hinders you there's not one thing in your way but you believe you're free you believe you're free you believe all the unbelief has gone away from you you believe that you're now in a Haven of Rest you believe the pressure's off of you I will be healed I can be sealed I am changed I am delivered I am a child of God I Am The Offspring of almighty God I am chosen I am elected I am an overcomer I am a winner I will not be defeated I will not go to a devil's grave I will not go to his hell hole no more you cannot worship from where you was last week you've got to worship from the experience that you had in this Camp you've got to worship free you've got to worship when shackles off of you you can't worship when there's change on your life you can't sing take God I'm free as long as the chains are upon you but if the chains are off if the shackles have been broke you are worshiping from freedom and there is nobody that can worship like somebody that's been set free because there's a reason why you can sing you don't know like I know because you were the one that was locked up you were the one that the devil lied to and you recognize that he ain't got his hand on you no more you're free and then the sun is set free it's free and paid we're not going back to our chains we're not going back to our prison sale we're not going back to it because our lord Jesus came with the keys in his hand [Applause] The Keeper of the keys is here tell the devil you ain't got the keys to your own house you can't lock me up in there no more you can't lock me up in that prison cell you can't put me back in that turtle's hell you can't put me back there where you held me I know what it's like to be free and if you ever tasted the Sweet Taste of Victory you'll never go back to living a bad life no more hallelujah we're not ashamed we know when we came out of and the same God that came there and tapped Peter on the sale when he was there in the prison cell was the same God that came to you this weekend and said it's time that you rise and shine because there was prayer made up there in John Mark's house and they were praying for brother Peter they were praying for him and while they were praying for him the angel that was directed by prayer went to Peter's prison notice a prayer didn't send him down over to Lucy's house or Susie's house but he sent him to Peter's house and there were some mamas that was praying there were some pastors that was praying and the angel came and woke you up and said it's time to get out of your shackles and it's time to worship you cannot look for the chains you cannot look at where you was you've got to look at where God is going to take you David could not look at Goliath's head because he was looking at the promises of God Promises of God are so big that you can't even see that washed up of a Giant's head because he know you know that God ain't never lost about can I just talk to you for a moment God's never lost a battle God's not intentioning he's not in the having any tensions that he's going to lose today if he won the victory two thousand years ago he's going to win the victory this morning is that right I will not go back to a devil's hell I will not go back to depression let's make some affirmations here this morning I will not go back to my prison house I will not go back to that dark cloud spirit I will not go back to that fear I will not go back to that mentality I will not go back to a slave mentality come on somebody you can sing that song I would not be denied when Pains of death She's On My Soul unto the Lord I cried till Jesus came and he made me whole I would not be denied what was it somebody was worshiping from a faith that said I'm not going to be denied I'm not going to this Camp just to have another Camp experience but I'm coming to meet a living God another random set an expectation he said when those little shackles and Dark Shadows get broke away then the Holy Spirit can come right in and perform Miracles there's nothing impossible with it then I'm gonna read it to you again when those little shackles and Dark Shadows get broke away Dark Shadows I don't find one in the building this morning [Music] [Applause] not Shadows shackles how can you still be sacred when the key when the god that has a key lets you loose and if God lets you loose he's not binding you up no more the devil is only as good as his weapon of lying to you so don't believe his lie don't believe him your Miracle's in the room your breakthrough is here your Victory is here your undercoming powers here I don't know if you can feel it here this morning or not you might be tired in your spirit but your Miracle is here your Victory is here your presence is here but your future is clear say brother Andrew ah I know what it's like to be free but I want to tell you there's more coming there's more Victory coming you're going to have trials but you're going to worship your way out of it you can have troubles but you're going to worship your way out of it right now in this room your miracle for the future is here your breakfast for the future is here I know you can't see it but your Miracle your miracles in the room if we could say it like this Esther's miracles in the room if we could say it like this brother Ron's Miracle it's in the room my breakthrough's in the room my Holy Ghost is in the room my baby will be protected is in the room brother random said he said it's just like television or radio it's passing through this room but you don't see it you don't see it but it's here he said all of those sound waves he said What It Takes he said it takes a channel that is opened up so that it can reach in there and it can catch the inspiration of where it's coming you can't see him but there's colors flying through here you can't see them right here but there are spirits that are leaving here you can't see it but there's a God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob that is here he's passing through this room he said but oh he said if there would be a great big banner that would pass through the room a thing that would it would say yes across it he said we couldn't see it until it got into a Channel of inspiration of television or radio so that we could pick it up but there's an inspiration that is here it's your faith and your faith is saying yes to the promises of God I am healed I am delivered I'm no longer pound yes and William Branham said he said when there's one thought he said one one says yes there's the power of one but when two say yes it's a power of two he said it's a double blessing then the power of three then the power of four yes yes but all if all of this building could say yes it's mine I am delivered yes yes it's passing through this room right now this ain't taking Stein this ain't Putin's time this ain't Biden's time this is our time the time is at hand this is the bright survival this is the Golden Age the shackles are rolled off of you remember when William Branham because they're in a prayer line in his early Ministry and it's there in a foreign land and there's a little girl that is sitting there that's got these braces on her leg remember she's sitting there she's waiting and brother Branham he's passing by and children have a very special spot there's there's never a child that I've ever prayed for and I could ever forget them children have a very special spot in our hearts but this little girl was sitting there and had these braces upon her leg she's sitting there as brother Brandon passed by she reached up and kissed his coat you remember she reached up and she kissed his coat and brother Branham said he said I turned around to her and said you're healed he said a vision broke and he said I've seen that she was healed he said but she couldn't understand me because of the language barrier because of the language barrier and he said they took me immediately he said in that night there was Miracle on top of Miracles he said they grabbed crutches armed full of crutches and they took them out of there but you see the vision had already spoke and the vision had got to come to pass because a vision can never fail you recognize that she'd come there with that Faith she reached out and she kissed the prophets coattail there as he passed by but the vision had already broke and maybe you don't understand because the language barrier maybe there's a laodicea barrier that's trying to keep you thinking that you're going to go back to that but a vision has already broke God's language is not that you go back God's languages that you be free William Branham said that he was sitting there and he was speaking through that interpreter and he said you only say what I say he said honey you are already healed said you go over there and you take those braces off and when those braces come off just raise your hand up and when you raise your hand up College oh why don't you lift up those hands that once held lower the feeble hands are once hung down you are not in shekels no more and when she lifted up her hand he said I heard a scream he said there she come running across that platform what was it the braces had come off the shackles had come off why don't you lift those hands you that's been set free you're that's been delivered why don't you let out a scream and said I am free I am to live first I am broke free that's not a language barrier between you and Papa God you know what he's saying to you God's language God's language used to throw down every devil his language is the cast down every evil spirit his language is to throw down Idols his language is that you'll be fret set free but his language is not just for the personal things that you'd have made of his language is for Rapture let me tell you if we don't go into Rapture this message is no good to us but if this message is wrong then all Christianity is wrong the angel is here to back up what the messenger said the language of the angels of the Angel is you are returned back he didn't give you a message of has frustration he gave you a message of full restoration you're not under a Luther worship you're not under a Wesleyan worship you're not under Azusa worship you are under the greatest restoration message that there ever has been every Every Chain has been broke off of it you're not worshiping from a closed book you're worshiping from an open book The Seals have been broke off our understanding is open we recognize the seals have been ripped off every devil that said he was going to destroy us is a liar the white horse rider that was riding in Revelations 5 we recognize that he is powerless you see because of our understanding of theologians they told us that that was our Lord up there riding on that white horse but when the seal broke forth he gave us an understanding that that was the Antichrist writing on that but what did William Bradham tell us he's riding up there he's got a bow but he ain't got no errors so the weapons that he's throwing that to have no effect on you because your sword and your Shield of faith but is it you're not worshiping from a closed mentality there are certain people here that have an understanding you could put a Luther in this building you could put on Wesleyan in this building and they wouldn't understand what we're talking about but because there has been a barrier that has been broken all of the things have been ripped off of your mentality you can no longer think from the mentality of a closed book let me tell you once you see it you can never unsee it because God when he gives a revelation there might be intellectualism that will come and it might raise up to a certain standard but it'll only take you forward so far but Revelation never ends and what God has given you is not just some mental theology or an intellectualism he has given you a faith of Revelation to accept that the whole word is given unto you and every devil is trying to keep you from this you see there's a lot of people that can worship and say that they're worshiping but only you can worship like the father wants you to worship because you are the Queen of Heaven and there's nobody that can praise like you can preach there's nobody that can worship like you can worship job when he was in his worst of Trials he got up in Job chapter one then job arose he tore his robe and he shaved his head and he fell on the ground and he worshiped there's going to have to come a time in your life when you don't feel like worshiping that you have to worship so David said in Psalms 95 oh come let us sing unto the Lord and let us Make a Joyful Noise to the rock of our salvation let us come before his presence with Thanksgiving and Make a Joyful Noise unto him with Psalms Psalms 100 and Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord all you lands serve the Lord with gladness come before his presence with singing Exodus 15. then saying Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord and spake saying I will sing to the Lord for he have triumphed gloriously the horse and the rider hath he thrown into the sea judges five and three hear o you Kings give ear o you princess ah even I will sing it to the Lord I will sing praise to the Lord God of Israel first chronicles 16 and 23 singing to the Lord all the Earth so forth from day to day his salvation not just week into weekend and night just came to Camp day to day his salvation Psalms 13 and 6 I will sing unto the Lord because he has dealt bountifully with me Psalms 30 and 4 sing unto the Lord oh you Saints of his and give thanks at the remembrance of his Holiness Psalm 66 and 1 Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands Psalms 81 and 1 sing aloud unto God our strength Make a Joyful Noise unto the god of Jacob Psalms 95 Oh Come and Let us sing it to the Lord let us Make a Joyful Noise not a mournful noise but a Joyful Noise to the rock of our Salvation Psalms 96 of singing to the Lord a new song let me go ahead and get one ecclesiastical devil right here while I'm here they say we shouldn't be singing these new style of worship songs but the Bible says Sing a new song everywhere I go I hear devils in my ear telling us that we should not be singing that song he is here and he is our Waymaker that song way maker has had more trouble than any other song that we're singing right now because people say that we're not singing that we're just singing that to anybody but we're not just singing that to anybody we're singing that to Jesus people say well you could be singing that to the cardboard you could be singing that too you could see singing that to anybody but we're not singing that song just anybody he's here even when you don't see him he's working even when you don't feel him he's working I'm not singing my song through a dead God I'm singing my song to a god that's a Waymaker that's a promise keeper that's a devil Destroyer that raises up early on Sunday morning and if he said sing I'm gonna sing [Applause] Psalms 98 I'll sing it to the Lord a new song for he hath done marvelous things can you say he's done marvelous things his right hand and His holy arm hath gotten him the victory Psalms 98 and 4 Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord all the Earth make a loud noise and rejoice and sing and praise sing it to the Lord with a harp with the harp and the voice of Psalm where the trumpets and of a sound of a comment Make a Joyful Noise before the Lord Psalms 147 and 7 sing unto the Lord with Thanksgiving sing praise unto the harp unto our God Psalms 149 Praise You the Lord sing it to the Lord a new song and his praise in the congregation of saints Isaiah 12 and 5 sing to the Lord for he have done excellent things this is known in all the Earth Isaiah 42 and 10 sing unto the Lord a new song and it's praise from the end of the Earth ye that go down to the Sea and all that therein the aisles and the inhabitants thereof Jeremiah 20 and 13 sing unto the Lord so God must like to hear your voice he must like to hear your voice he doesn't like to hear you in sorrow he doesn't like to hear you in pain how many here this morning I just want to do something real quick how many here this morning is in pain in their body take a look around how many is hearing pain in their body this morning I got my hand on my body's still shaking from last night but we can't see your pain I can look all over you but I can't see your pain it's something internal that only the people that you tell how did I know you were in pain because you told me that you was in pain but how do I know you're in Victory you're not just telling me you're telling every devil in hell I'm a victory so God wants to hear where you are experiencing him from you are experiencing him from freedom why was Miriam over there in Exodus 15 singing and playing or tambourine well that's because of the experience that she just had when I watched my little girls come through this line last night under the influence of the mighty angel you don't know what that does to a daddy's heart to watch the same God that gave you a birth gives them a birth and for them to Rejoice under the presence of the Lord but you can imagine my heart but imagine God's heart this morning he knows what you've been through he knows the pain that you're being in he knows the struggles that you went through that's why your soul can only be sunk from you you have got to sing you have got to praise when you don't feel like praising him you've got to praise him we don't feel like the strength is there to praise him praise Him anyhow when you are utterly drained praise him when the baby isn't showed up you still gotta praise him when the test is not positive you still gotta Praise Him when the Cancer's still there you still gotta praise him when the temperatures still whispering in your ear with bitterness you've got to praise Him anyhow when the people that you hate or the people that have utterly try to mock you and make fun of you are there you still got to praise him God wants somebody that'll praise him no matter what they're going through no matter what they're feeling God has appointed you to sing He Knows Your Song and only you can sing it there's power in your song there's power in your praise it's well I don't really have a very good voice let me tell you your voice is sweet to him he don't care how much talent you got he wants your heart come on some naughty he don't care if you can carry a tune in a bucket he wants your heart salt for too long too many times people had put their Harps upon the willow tree because the enemy had spread itself forth like a Green Bay Tree and it looked like they were prospering more than the righteous but you have got to get your heart down off the willow tree stop crying about it stop being in pity stop thinking every time everybody else's fault and start worshiping God wants worship and if it's going to be worshiped then we ought to do it according to the Bible we ought to worship Him in spirit and in truth you're not worshiping him from an experience of Moses you're not worshiping him from Paul's experience you're worshiping him from your experience you know that the Bible tells us that when Jehoshaphat had won a player that Jehoshaphat when the enemy the multitude that came in against him that the multitude went in there and they come all and they spread all around the children of Israel and Jehoshaphat he went up there where did he go do his self-pity to his problems to his struggles absolutely not he went to the house of the Lord and when he went to the house of the Lord he went up there and called a fast over all of Israel and he caught up there and notice what the Lord when the Lord will come a player and he met what Jehoshaphat he commanded a feast a fast me over top of all to the land of Israel and when they got up there God spoke to him and said this is my battle you see this is not just your battle this is God's battle and when it feels like you are all alone God has saved her and he says you're not even going to have to fight in this battle this is my battle and I'm going to fight for you but he gave Jehoshaphat instructions and he told him to go up there and appoint singers and praisers to praise him in the beauty of his holiness and when he brought them up there notice here's all of these multitudes in there all of them multitudes are in there all of them enemies are in there I want you to think about the enemy that you fought till you got here all of them enemies are lined up out there and here Jehoshaphat appointed singers and he appointed singers to go over there and they started singing and when they begin to sing aloud that the Bible tells us that they begin to shout and praise the Lord that the Bible said that the Lord said ambushments upon their adversaries the Bible if you go to studying that out it means to lie in wait so God was there before their praise ever got out before you ever broke out God was already there before you accepted your Liberty God was already Fair before you set yourself before God sets you free you God was already there and the Bible tells us if you really go to shutting out the Bible says if you go to studying out that ambushment it means to bring a confusion their praise was so loud that it confused those devils and them Devils turned on themselves and defeated themselves can you imagine the anxiety and the depression that you fought start taking their own swords and start slitting there on long necks that's exactly what's going to happen in the battle of Armageddon those demons are going to turn on one another what is it anxiety turned on depression fear turned on suicide and they destroyed themselves let your praise ring out of confusion you cannot separate War for worship because Judah means praise and every time you go into battle you've got to have some worship you have been elected overcome you've been elected to win the battle but you're not worshiping David you're not worshiping David from a body that's not been anointed you're anointed for this you're elected for this but you're going to go back to your home and the anointing is going to be on you things might look the same you might go back to the same seat fold you might go back to the same Mountain you might go back to the same church but the anointing is there when the prophet poured out the anointing he didn't come there and wipe it off of him he poured it over him and when he poured the anointing oil upon your life the baptism of the Holy Ghost he didn't come and take it away from you he sealed your faith let me know you know the Bible tells us the Bible tells us that there was no holy ghost at that time is that right there was no holy ghost at that time but when Saul was tormented by them Devils up there you remember that they called for a worshiper because worship drives away spirits it matters what you're listening to it matters what you're doing and they called little bitty old David up there because the prophet said in those days he said there was no divide there was no healing there so there was no Divine Healing he said but David was a Divine healer by music and David drove out Spirits by music so it matters what you're playing David wasn't up here playing some rock and roll and he wasn't playing some AC DC he was playing the Lord as my shipper and I shall not vote yay though I walked to the valley for the shadow of death I won't fear no evil the Lord is my light the Lord is my salvation the Lord is my rock he has enlarged my foots that I would not fall play his heart there's nobody that can play Your Heart Like You and David's playing his harp Saul begins to fill his Spirit renewed because of worship but Saul Saul had turned his face away from God but David was raised under the anointing for such an hour as this and David brought healing by music if there was healing by music thee and there's healing by music now there's too many people that's wanting to kick music out of the church but it was when music was played it went a lie to us a player and he was Miffy that there is when the spirit of the Lord Came Upon Elijah when he grabbed the menstrual and the menstrual was played so if God like music then God likes music now and there's nobody the Bride of Jesus Christ has got the best worship she's got the best best best music players she's got the best dancers she's got the best worship person because you don't know like on what he's done for me [Applause] you're not worshiping from a spot of change let me deal with this just a little bit longer you're not worshiping from a spot of change you're worshiping from freedom is that right Lily you're worshiping from freedom and nobody can serve God like you can serve God all over this building I want you to look at your neighbor say nobody can serve God like I can serve God you know what it's like to be bound but you know what it's like to be free and when God put the message upon your heart for freedom to come by your way what no devil ever going to talk you back into going back after the unbounds I know what it's like to be set free I know what it's like to be in a prison's hell and you can't talk me back to going into it but the prophet said David was a little bitty old dancer said he was dancing all the time because David had the victory when he went up there before that great big Uncle alive that big old problem that he had big old giant looking thing big old head that you couldn't miss he said that David had so much victory in there before he saw the battle he was a dancing [Music] before he saw the last fall he was an action before he saw that Spirit leave him he was a dancer before he fell free he was a dancing the glass was still there but David wasn't answering the problem might be stacked up against you but the truth it says that Jesus it's a rock Jesus is your salvation Jesus is your freedom David was a little bitty old man the prophet said David went down there little dancing said he went down there dancing down into the valley there's Goliath still out there but David's a dancing suicide still sticking around but I'm still dancing problems are still there but I'm still dancing bitterness might still come and haunt you but I'm still dancing depressing my tongue but I'm still dancing problems might be stacked up against you but you gotta dance your way out of it come on David come on David David reached down there and he grabbed him five smooth Stones that's the best thing to do is when you go to a fight to pick up j-e-s-u-s and David walked down there he had so much stance on the inside of his heart that he went down there dancing he went down there dancing he said oh my that big old head of that Goliath how could I miss him it's a little bit of stone in Revelation but it's got enough power well I got victory of the enemy and the world you can't do them in Ohio well he's God in the father he's God in the sun he's God in the Holy Ghost he's got all three in one and I know God he's God and he don't never change I know God is God and Jesus is his name I still see him but you gotta dance David it was a dancing while he was swinging That Swing he was dancing he had so much victory [Applause] he had so much victory that the prophet said when he slung that rock he was going at a thousand miles per second your enemy is dead foreign [Music] [Music] get out of it rise up mighty Gentile Warriors [Applause] come on brother Derek I'm on now I'm going back to it we ain't going back to it I know what it's like I know what it's like to be in a prison cell I know what it's like to be there and still locked up and feel like you're gonna have to go back to this and go back to that but there's so much victory in this camp your goddess will change your son's retention [Applause] you got the Victory and there ain't one devil in hell that could shut down your business and shut down your future because God is on your side come on brother air what that's on your side he's a mighty cop and he's never lost a battle he ain't losing one now and you're gonna win Hallelujah he's our strength he's your weapon he's a Warfare brother man I'm sitting he said brother man I'm sending oh oh he was David was like oh Johnny Crow said he just got that check they had so much victory that he danced on top of that Devil's Head do you recognize how big your devil's head is suicide I want you to get ready for this depression bitterness pain in my body pencil on my body high blood pressure struggles family problems abusive spirits brother Byron said that David had so much victory that he danced on top of that Goliath and he wrapped up there and it got his sword [Applause] Hammond's got a sword of the enemy in your hand why don't you take that problem that's what you've been facing take you shackles off of me take these problems off of me Johnny Crow you're free you're free you're free you're free how about it Rebecca freedom feels good how about it brother cross is he your God or is he just your mama's God how about brother Bennett come on Levi you were built to be a priest under the most high God priests is set there to make a sacrifice upon the Altar and a sacrifice is when you don't feel like worshiping you're still worship when you don't feel like praising you're still praise he said brother Angel I don't know what it's like let me tell you what it's like I ain't got it by a doctor's report but I do have it by his report that Ron Spencer's cancer-free so I have got to dance on top of that old time cancer you might as well get under my feet come on now why don't you put that devil underneath of your feet you've got enough Victory to make

they're right why don't you raise your hand if you saw it right there look all over his building what was it it was a Milky presence of the Holy Spirit that came to our worship and he showed up again yeah he ain't gonna leave you after this camp its present is here to confirm that and he's challenging you to believe that the son of man is revealed in the bride's body is Easter reminds me it reminds me it reminds me about when the presence of the Lord came when Solomon was built in the temple and the congregation couldn't hit her because the presence of the Lord was so strong but it also reminds me when I Prophet was over there in Africa and he saw them heathens packing their idols and they were carrying that just in case that the god of the Bible couldn't keep them so they was packing this by packing his Idol around another Brandon watched them packing that Idol into that meeting and you remember how the prophet stood there was that blind man he was dealing with he'd been entertained by the religions of the world that day he said if any of your Gods can heal him come up here all right he said but if Jesus Is Our Lord why don't you throw down your idols and when that boy was healed brother random said there was such a dust storm because they had threw down their idols this presence reminds me there has been some Idols that threw down this weekend Idols that you picked up I don't say you created but your worship shows that the miners have no hold on you no more passion has no hole the person has no hope no oil has no holes fear has no holes you're right Ella
