[32:48] faith is the substance of things hoped
[32:51] for

[32:54] for by it the elders obtained a good
[32:56] report
[32:58] through faith we understand that the
[33:00] worlds were framed by the word of god so
[33:02] the things which are seen were not made

[33:32] been in and
[33:33] and i i want to i want you to understand
[33:35] the world to understand that we're still
[33:37] fighting the good fight of faith
[33:40] amen our faith is not wavering our faith
[33:42] is not down our faith is not defeated
[33:45] but our faith is still in the word of
[33:47] god
[33:47] you know brother branham would talk
[33:49] about the good fight of faith and he
[33:50] would talk about the christian walk and
[33:52] he says
[33:53] remember we're not on a picnic
[33:56] we're in a battlefield
[33:58] i said many people just think that when
[34:00] you become a christian that's all that
[34:01] they need to do and that settles it
[34:03] forever and they are a christian and
[34:05] everything's going to come easy he said
[34:07] don't ever get that in your head
[34:10] he said for i become for i become a
[34:12] christian to fight
[34:15] amen to fight the good fight of faith i
[34:17] become a christian to get in the battle
[34:20] lines we're christian soldiers we we
[34:22] have been trained we've been brought up
[34:24] to know all the techniques of the enemy
[34:26] to know how to fortify to know how to
[34:29] fight the fight we can only do what the
[34:32] holy spirit has revealed unto us
[34:35] we cannot take something somebody you
[34:37] know if our nation goes to war they're
[34:39] not to take some other nation's idea or
[34:42] somebody else's opinion but he said just
[34:44] as that we're we're only to take the
[34:46] holy spirit and how he would direct us
[34:49] what ideas he would give us because he
[34:52] is the commanding chief of the army of
[34:55] the christians
[34:56] amen but i say we are in a battle but it
[34:59] will be worth it all
[35:00] amen we are in a war but it'll be worth
[35:03] every fight it'll be worth every mile
[35:05] it'll be worth everything that we ever
[35:07] go through in life's journey when we get
[35:09] over onto the other side amen you know i
[35:12] this just this week brother george and
[35:14] brother tim would take me and brother
[35:16] george brother tim winters would take me
[35:18] and brother tim my dad to colorado and
[35:20] you know we'd see some pretty country
[35:22] and and and go into some very
[35:25] to me it felt very scary situations as
[35:28] we would i you know i'm from the
[35:29] lowlands so i'm not used to a whole lot
[35:31] of heights and we'd go up on a place you
[35:33] know up in the rocky mountain national
[35:36] park and then also to pike's peak and 14
[35:39] 000 feet and it was a lot of scary
[35:41] highways you know we'd give brother tim
[35:43] a hard time about driving and be keep
[35:45] your eyes on the road you know don't you
[35:47] don't you don't have to look we'll look
[35:48] for you
[35:49] because you know in those places there
[35:51] would be some hairpin turns there would
[35:53] be some very dangerous seemingly you
[35:55] know i don't really understand they
[35:57] would build these mountains these roads
[35:58] on the side of the mountain and there's
[36:00] no guard rail and i'm riding i'm looking
[36:02] straight down this mountain and the road
[36:05] is right on the edge of the mountain it
[36:06] seems like just the wrong turn you'll
[36:08] fall off and you know many times that's
[36:10] like our journey in life
[36:12] it's a fight to get up the hill it's a
[36:15] fight to get to where we're going but
[36:17] i'll say it'll be worth the view
[36:19] amen when we get to that last mile and
[36:21] we get to that last turn which i believe
[36:23] with all my heart we're very close to
[36:25] that last turn or that last place amen
[36:28] but it's a struggle many times and and
[36:31] anxieties and fears tries to set in
[36:34] because you see all the dangers that are
[36:36] around you but it's not our eyes is not
[36:38] to get on our on the dangers our eye our
[36:41] goal is for our eyes to get on the goal
[36:44] amen to where we're going somebody would
[36:46] say it like this it says the lives of
[36:48] the heroes of faith in hebrews 11 had
[36:51] their share of hairpin turns and humdrum
[36:55] situations and dangerous situations but
[36:58] they pressed on and they did not turn
[37:00] back their destination heaven
[37:04] our destination is not pike's peak or
[37:07] the rocky mountain national park i mean
[37:09] that's a beautiful place here on earth
[37:11] but we got something even more grand
[37:12] than that
[37:13] something more greater than that's ever
[37:15] been amen our destination is heaven a
[37:18] city which has foundations whose builder
[37:21] and maker is god amen and i'm here to
[37:24] say again it'll be worth every battle
[37:27] it'll be worth every scar it'll be worth
[37:29] every tier it'll be worth every struggle
[37:32] it'll be worth every persecution it'll
[37:34] be worth every kind of thing every
[37:36] temptation that's ever come against us
[37:38] it will be worth it all paul would say
[37:41] it like this he said i reckon that the
[37:43] sufferings of this present time are not
[37:46] worthy to be compared with the glory
[37:49] which shall be revealed in us amen if we
[37:52] would realize what is at the end there
[37:54] would be no thoughts of giving up
[37:56] there'll be no thoughts of turning
[37:58] around if we realize what is right
[38:00] before us we would press with everything
[38:03] that we have
[38:04] amen you know and brother brown would
[38:06] bring it down to the end as he said we
[38:08] would get to that table and he said we
[38:10] would look across and say god bless you
[38:12] brother my he said we'll have a little
[38:14] cry maybe don't you believe so we'll
[38:17] just cry a little bit for joy as we sit
[38:19] there at that table and then at the head
[38:21] of the table will come our king in his
[38:23] majesty he will walk down among us he'll
[38:26] put his arms around us he'll say you
[38:28] suffered much you went through much for
[38:31] me but he'll take that hand and he'll
[38:33] wipe every tear away from our eyes and
[38:35] he'll say now don't cry anymore it's all
[38:38] over
[38:39] it's all over he said that's why we're
[38:41] here isn't it want to be wonderful to
[38:44] feel that arm come around you and say

[38:57] opportunity let's make it a good fight
[39:01] oh hallelujah let's make it a real fight
[39:04] let's put everything that we have into
[39:06] it just like the old uh the
[39:09] patriarchs of old let's give everything
[39:11] we got our last breath our last hope our
[39:15] last everything our last bit of energy
[39:17] our last bit of uh of mental strength
[39:20] everything that we got because we know
[39:23] there's something very great ahead of us
[39:25] amen we know that it's not just a pipe
[39:28] uh you know pipe dreams and air castles
[39:30] that we're talking about but there's
[39:32] something real more real than what we're
[39:34] sitting here experiencing more real than
[39:37] the things that we have seen every day
[39:39] there's a land beyond the river and it's
[39:41] worth going to it's worth fighting for
[39:45] amen if you've already if you're a
[39:47] red-blooded american male uh your blood
[39:50] on the inside of you will get to bowling
[39:52] over a land that you've lived in you're
[39:54] born in and you want to fight and defend
[39:56] it how much more should a christian have
[39:58] a fight in them to know there's a land
[40:01] that don't have the things that we're
[40:03] going through in the and the sin and the
[40:06] unbelief and the worry and the fear
[40:08] there's a land beyond all of that and
[40:11] it's worth fighting for
[40:13] it's worth fighting to get there
[40:17] you say well i i don't want to fight
[40:18] well let me tell you something you'll
[40:20] fight your way to hell
[40:23] it's a fight no matter what
[40:26] amen hebrews 11 as we go through these
[40:29] very quickly by faith abel offered unto
[40:32] god it was by faith enoch it was a fight
[40:36] of faith
[40:37] listen enoch's walk was not an easy walk
[40:40] it was in a time even similar to what
[40:42] we're living in
[40:44] sin was abounding it was worse than it's
[40:46] ever been as as noah was coming it was a
[40:48] flood as the flood was at the very gates
[40:52] of the earth and it was about to
[40:53] overtake the earth and but yet enoch by
[40:56] faith amen by faith was translated that
[41:00] he should not see death and was not
[41:02] found because god translated him before
[41:04] because before his translation he had
[41:07] this testimony he pleased god
[41:10] and he had a fight to do that
[41:13] he had a fight to to take a stand he had
[41:16] to stand against all kinds of things
[41:18] that was there upon upon the earth amen
[41:20] and the sins and the you know why would
[41:23] jesus say as it was in the days of noah
[41:25] so shall it be
[41:27] amen homosexuality and perversion and
[41:30] everything he had to fight through it
[41:33] listen he had a fight to turn his head
[41:37] he had to fight amen to
[41:40] to push day after day amen but when it
[41:43] was worth it all
[41:45] because one day he went for a walk and
[41:48] he never returned
[41:50] amen there's a bride that's the same as
[41:53] any guards is now standing upon the
[41:55] earth and they're fighting every step
[41:57] they're fighting and they're fighting on
[41:59] wednesday night they're fighting on
[42:01] monday they're fighting on on sunday
[42:03] they're fighting every day every hour
[42:05] we're fighting but one day we're going
[42:07] to take a walk and we're not coming back
[42:12] hallelujah and we're going to walk above
[42:14] every sin i better ever doubt about
[42:17] every word and anxiety and mind battle
[42:21] and every spirit of hell that's trying
[42:23] to hold you it's going to be broke loose
[42:25] one of these days and this whole body's
[42:28] going to change just like any change
[42:31] but you're going to have to fight to get
[42:32] there
[42:35] i mean we can't we can't expect if our
[42:37] brothers had to fight that we're going
[42:38] to go on some flowery bit of ease and
[42:41] we're going to have a wonderful time in
[42:42] laodicea and this is going to be so easy
[42:45] there's not going to be no mind battles
[42:46] there's not going to be no spirits to
[42:48] haunt at you there's not going to be no
[42:49] anxiety no this or that in the other
[42:53] no no
[42:54] we got to fight
[42:56] you got to fight to get something out of
[42:58] service
[43:00] amen because there's so there's clouds
[43:02] that's trying to push over you and you
[43:04] got to fight through them
[43:08] he says without faith is impossible to
[43:10] please him
[43:11] for he that cometh to god must believe
[43:13] that he is and he's a rewarder of them
[43:15] that digi diligently seek him by faith
[43:18] noah think about that man's fight
[43:21] to build something a boat to to come
[43:24] against something that had never
[43:25] happened before
[43:27] to stand there as a memorial that a
[43:30] flood is coming
[43:31] but we got a boat well god said build a
[43:33] certain boat well won't our boat work no
[43:36] he said you got to do it this way he had
[43:38] to fight he had he had been given a
[43:41] blueprint and he had to fight to stay
[43:43] there on that line that god had drawn
[43:45] for him he had to do everything he could
[43:48] to push aside somebody else's idea how a
[43:51] boat ought to be built and how it ought
[43:52] to be done and how this ought to take
[43:54] place he had to fight past all of that
[43:58] listen we got to fight past intellectual
[44:01] ideas
[44:02] we got to fight beyond people's ideals
[44:04] of what the holy ghost is and how it
[44:06] acts and how it ought to be our service
[44:09] ought to be we got to fight past all of
[44:11] that
[44:17] we got to fight by past all the critics
[44:20] all their naysaying and manoa had it
[44:24] every day nobody no doubt somebody come
[44:26] up there and made fun of and mocked him
[44:28] and if they had youtube they had youtube
[44:30] videos about him
[44:33] every
[44:34] day of how that you know their their
[44:38] services are better than the camp
[44:40] services and how they can do it better
[44:43] our boat's better in your boat
[44:49] our services do better things than your
[44:51] services do and you know these critics
[44:53] want to point to every mistake and every
[44:55] problem and everything you know they
[44:57] want to point to those that came to a
[44:59] camp and they shouted and they came back
[45:01] and it wasn't changed
[45:03] but why don't we start pointing to those
[45:05] who was changed
[45:06] [Applause]
[45:08] right
[45:10] why don't why don't we start pointing to
[45:11] those that that that have went to those
[45:14] places and and they experienced that
[45:16] same shouting they experience that same
[45:18] emotion they experience that same
[45:21] movement of the holy ghost and their
[45:23] lives have never been the same
[45:29] just talk to brother david and brother
[45:31] matthew mcgarry of their experience at
[45:33] camp
[45:36] and how they said they've got in their
[45:38] presence and their lives have never been
[45:40] what about them
[45:42] what about andrew glover that was born
[45:45] filled with the holy ghost at a camp
[45:46] meeting what about him
[45:48] and that's just a few there's thousands
[45:51] of them
[45:52] that have been in those places and
[45:54] changed forever
[46:00] but noah
[46:01] being warned of god of things not yet
[46:04] seen
[46:05] moved with fear
[46:07] prepared an ark to the saving of his
[46:09] house
[46:11] by the which he condemned the world and
[46:13] became the heir of the righteousness
[46:15] which is by faith
[46:17] amen noah had to fight to save his
[46:19] family
[46:22] what's wrong with our fathers who won't
[46:23] fight to save their families
[46:26] won't do something when their daughters
[46:28] are wearing things they shouldn't wear
[46:30] doing things they shouldn't do and their
[46:32] sons are doing why won't you fight for
[46:34] them
[46:36] it's a good fight of faith it will be
[46:39] worth it all
[46:45] by faith abraham
[46:47] when he's called to go out into a place
[46:50] which he should have to receive for an
[46:52] inheritance
[46:53] obeyed and he went out not knowing
[46:55] whether he went
[46:56] by faith he's sojourn in the land of a
[46:58] promise
[47:00] as an estranged country dwelling in the
[47:02] tabernacles of isaac and jacob the heirs
[47:04] with him of the same promise for he
[47:07] looked for a city which had foundations
[47:09] whose builder and maker is god through
[47:12] faith also sarah herself received
[47:14] strength to conceive seed
[47:17] she had to fight to get there
[47:19] she had to fight pastor moodiness she
[47:22] had to fight pastor her attitude she had
[47:24] to fight pastor old age
[47:26] she had to fight past it all to receive
[47:29] the promise
[47:31] but it was worth it
[47:34] amen
[47:35] because she judged and was delivered of
[47:38] a child when she was past age because
[47:40] she judged him faithful who had promised
[47:43] therefore sprang there even one of one
[47:45] of him as good as dead so many as the
[47:47] stars of the sky and multitude and as a
[47:50] sand which is by the seashore
[47:52] innumerable these all died in faith not
[47:56] having received the promise but haven't
[47:57] seen them afar off and were persuaded of
[48:00] them and embraced them and confessed
[48:03] them that were strangers and pilgrims on
[48:05] the earth for they that say such things
[48:08] declare plainly that they seek a country
[48:12] for they that have this fight are saying
[48:15] i'm seeking a better place
[48:17] i'm not comfortable living here no more
[48:19] this is not where i belong i belong in
[48:22] another land
[48:26] i mean think about it drop one of y'all
[48:28] off on the third world country somewhere
[48:30] in haiti right now and see how you'll
[48:32] fight or afghanistan for goodness sake
[48:34] and see how you fight
[48:36] there's men we're willing some of them
[48:38] willing to fight to grab onto an
[48:39] airplane to get somewhere else
[48:43] we got to have that same tenacity
[48:45] i'll do whatever it takes
[48:48] i'll do whatever it takes i'm going to
[48:50] go on with jesus
[48:52] if this one don't go it ain't going to
[48:54] hinder me if that one don't go i'm still
[48:56] going on it don't matter who falls to
[48:58] the right who falls to the left i'm
[49:01] going to go on with jesus
[49:10] for now
[49:14] and truly
[49:15] if they had been mindful of that country
[49:17] from which they come out
[49:19] they might have had opportunity to
[49:22] return
[49:23] in other words if everything was in
[49:25] their mind what they left
[49:27] they would have turned back but they had
[49:30] to fight
[49:31] to put that out of their mind
[49:34] nathan and corey couldn't do that fight
[49:37] all those that follow him they died
[49:39] because they could not put egypt out of
[49:41] their mind
[49:43] out of their hearts
[49:44] out of their thinking out of their
[49:46] desires i don't
[49:48] listen we're called to be a separated
[49:49] people
[49:51] but we're seeing some of them among us
[49:54] still has a desire for laodicea
[49:56] has it you say how do you know can you
[49:58] see it on your outward appearance
[50:01] that your heart is still towards
[50:02] laodicea amen just like uh
[50:06] lot's wife she was looking towards sodom
[50:11] she looked towards it before she got
[50:13] there
[50:14] but her desires and things she started
[50:16] looking and desired and no doubt sodom
[50:19] started moving on her and and and
[50:22] started on her outward appearance and
[50:23] things and her thoughts and all that
[50:25] kind of stuff why she couldn't put it
[50:27] out of her mind
[50:28] she couldn't get it out of her heart
[50:36] you got to
[50:38] fight but now they desired a better
[50:41] country
[50:42] oh my
[50:44] that is a heavenly country wherefore god
[50:47] is not ashamed to be called
[50:49] their god
[50:50] for he hath prepared for them a city
[50:53] oh hallelujah
[50:55] for by faith abraham when he was tried
[50:57] offered of isaac that he received the
[50:59] promise offered up his only begotten son
[51:01] who has said that in isaac shall thy
[51:03] seed be called accounting that god was
[51:05] able to raise him up even from the dead
[51:07] from which he also received him in
[51:08] figure by faith isaac blessed jacob and
[51:11] he saw concerning things to come by
[51:13] faith jacob when he was dying blessed
[51:15] both the sons of joseph and worship
[51:17] leaning on the top of the staff by faith
[51:19] joseph when he died made mention of the
[51:21] department of israel gave commandment
[51:23] concerning his bones by faith moses amen
[51:26] all he had to fight
[51:28] all the way down they had to fight to
[51:30] the red sea they had to fight through
[51:32] the walls of jericho they had to rahab
[51:35] had to fight
[51:38] and what shall we say more and time
[51:40] would fail to tell of gideon and bayrack
[51:43] and of samson and jephthah and david and
[51:45] samuel the prophets who through faith
[51:48] subdued
[51:50] subdued kingdoms this is what we're
[51:53] being brought here for to tear satan's
[51:55] kingdom down
[51:57] to subdue it to bring it powerless
[52:02] you say satan's kingdom becoming
[52:03] powerless yes it is in a people
[52:06] oh sure he's got power out there in
[52:08] laodicea but in a people he's lost power
[52:13] because their hearts not on his kingdom
[52:15] their hearts on a heavenly land
[52:18] they're looking for a heavenly place and
[52:20] they're fighting towards it and if i got
[52:22] to put my foot on that devil so be it
[52:24] and am i going to put my foot on that
[52:26] one so be it i'm going to overcome every
[52:28] one of them and push towards heaven as
[52:31] hard as i can go
[52:32] [Applause]
[52:39] subdue kingdoms
[52:41] wrought
[52:42] righteousness
[52:44] obtain promises
[52:46] stopped the mouth of lions
[52:48] quenched the violence of fire escaped
[52:51] the edge of the sword out of weaknesses
[52:54] were made strong
[52:55] waxed
[52:56] violent valiant in what
[53:00] fight
[53:01] turned to flight the armies of aliens
[53:05] women's received their dead raised to
[53:07] life again others were tortured not
[53:09] accepting deliverance that they might
[53:11] obtain a better
[53:12] resurrection others had trials of cruel
[53:15] walkings and scourgings moreover bonds
[53:18] and imprisonments they were stoned they
[53:20] were sown asunder they were tempted they
[53:22] were slain with a sword they wondered
[53:24] about in sheepskin and goatskins being
[53:27] destitute afflicted and tormented of
[53:29] whom the world was not worthy they
[53:32] wandered in deserts and mountains and
[53:34] dens and caves of the earth and these
[53:37] all haven't obtained a good report
[53:39] through faith received not the promise
[53:41] god having provided something better
[53:43] some better thing for us that they
[53:45] without us should not be made perfect
[53:49] but wherefore seeing where also are
[53:51] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[53:54] fighters
[53:57] that have said i've done it you can do
[53:59] it
[54:00] i fought them you can fight them i
[54:02] overcome them you can overcome them i
[54:05] say goliath you can slay goliath
[54:07] oh hallelujah i took the line by the
[54:10] throat and i cut his neck off you can do
[54:12] it
[54:17] i've witnessed the healing the power of
[54:19] god you can witness the healing power of
[54:21] god i witness the overcoming power of
[54:23] god that changed my life from a sinner
[54:26] to a son or daughter of god therefore
[54:29] you can have that as well
[54:31] i received a child though i was dead you
[54:34] can do it as well
[54:38] it's a cloud of fighters
[54:40] of witnesses
[54:41] saying now you need what you need to do
[54:44] is lay aside every weight
[54:47] lay aside the sin that would so easily
[54:49] beset you and run with patience a racist
[54:52] set before you
[54:54] looking unto jesus
[54:56] the author
[54:57] and finisher of our faith
[55:00] who for joy has that was was set before
[55:03] him endured the cross despising the
[55:04] shame and it sat down at the right hand
[55:07] of the throne of god
[55:11] and i stood there at my mother's bedside
[55:15] and they were they told us she was going
[55:17] to be taking her last breaths
[55:20] i grabbed her by the hand i didn't know
[55:22] i was i didn't know she could still hear
[55:24] me or not didn't matter
[55:26] felt like that baby she could and they
[55:27] said that's the last thing that leaves
[55:28] is the hearing
[55:30] i said mama
[55:32] you get over on the other side you tell
[55:34] them we're coming
[55:37] you tell them we're not stopping
[55:38] preaching the full gospel of christ
[55:41] we're not stopping to preach faith i'm
[55:43] not going to back up i'm not going to
[55:45] turn around i'm not going to give up and
[55:47] say it ain't so i know and so
[55:51] i saw the resurrection power working her
[55:54] life i know he's a god who heals i know
[55:57] he's a god who says
[56:00] hallelujah amen there's a crowd of
[56:02] witnesses saying come on you can make it
[56:05] what are you going to say to them
[56:08] i'm coming
[56:09] i'm not turning around i'm not backing
[56:12] up i'm not giving in i'm going on with
[56:14] everything that i got
[56:21] to fight the good fight of faith
[56:24] it means to remain true to god
[56:26] to remain true to his word
[56:29] even in the face of opposition
[56:33] oh it's very easy to remain true when
[56:34] all things are just fine and dandy but
[56:37] what about in the face of opposition
[56:39] children at school
[56:43] why are you wearing a dress
[56:44] why is your hair so long
[56:46] why you look like that
[56:48] you all look like an old foggy
[56:55] oppression
[56:57] to remain true to god and his word in
[56:59] the middle of our prayer
[57:01] opposition and oppression and adversity
[57:04] it means to have an unwavering
[57:06] allegiance to the cause of christ
[57:08] in the middle of hostilities
[57:11] both internal and external
[57:14] hello somebody
[57:16] fighting the good fight of faith means
[57:18] to have a firm determination i'm going
[57:21] to pursue righteousness
[57:22] i'm going to pursue godliness i'm going
[57:25] to have faith and love and perseverance
[57:27] and gentleness at all times and in all
[57:30] situations
[57:32] wow
[57:34] according to first timothy 6 12 it says
[57:36] to fight the good fight of faith
[57:38] almo also means that you will by the
[57:40] grace of god practice the spiritual
[57:43] disciplines of desire patience endurance
[57:46] perseverance for an imperishable crown
[57:49] of righteousness
[57:52] fight the good fight of faith take hold
[57:55] on eternal life
[57:56] and we're so quick to take hold of all
[57:58] kinds of stuff
[57:59] what about eternal life
[58:02] we take hold of our feelings we take
[58:03] hold of our pride we take hold of our
[58:05] arrogance we take hold of our uh you
[58:07] know it's my world we take what about
[58:10] eternal life
[58:11] take hold on eternal life
[58:14] to which you are called about what
[58:16] you're made the good profession in the
[58:18] presence of many witnesses
[58:20] you know paul would write this to
[58:22] timothy i've done some study this is
[58:24] some of the history of it
[58:26] he would write this to timothy from a
[58:27] roman prison
[58:29] and timothy was a young man in charge of
[58:32] the church of ephesus
[58:34] and i'll be honest with you my name is
[58:35] timothy so the book of timothy is very
[58:37] important to me
[58:39] matter of fact when i went overseas for
[58:41] the first time to guyana
[58:43] and uh
[58:44] you know just just barely in into the
[58:47] ministry
[58:48] and went with brother danny steam and
[58:50] brother jackie benton
[58:52] and we split up in the city there
[58:54] jamestown i think the name of it is and
[58:55] we all three on a sunday went to three
[58:57] different churches and i'd met this
[58:59] pastor at the airport when they picked
[59:01] us up didn't really know him but just
[59:02] shook his hand so i'm sitting in the
[59:04] back getting ready to come out
[59:06] and i'm just sitting in the back of the
[59:08] audience back there
[59:09] waiting for him to call me up and he
[59:11] says
[59:12] he says you know he says thanks we have
[59:14] a special treat
[59:16] he said we have brother timothy oh
[59:18] brother timothy brother timothy he said
[59:21] if you know what you were going to get
[59:23] this morning go read the book of timothy
[59:26] rebuke
[59:28] jason
[59:31] oh lord maybe i need to read the book of
[59:33] timothy
[59:35] so i read the book of timothy
[59:38] he's a young man in charge
[59:41] of the church there at ephesus ephesus
[59:43] with a prosperous roman city
[59:45] a strategic position of the city created
[59:48] a new unique environment of trading to
[59:51] thrive
[59:52] many of the city's inhabitants were
[59:53] wealthy because the increased commercial
[59:56] activities in that busy port
[59:59] a few wealthy individuals from the city
[1:00:01] had converted to christianity and among
[1:00:03] them were some who trusted in their
[1:00:06] wealth
[1:00:07] and not their god
[1:00:10] and paul would instruct timothy to warn
[1:00:12] him you need to fight the good fight of
[1:00:14] faith
[1:00:15] and you need to instruct these new
[1:00:16] believers to not trust in uncertain
[1:00:19] riches
[1:00:21] but trust in god
[1:00:24] ephesus was the headquarter even also
[1:00:26] the headquarter of the fertility cult of
[1:00:29] diana ephesus city boasted of having one
[1:00:32] of the most celebrated pagan temples in
[1:00:34] the ancient world sounds a lot like our
[1:00:36] day
[1:00:37] the the temple of our artemis was one of
[1:00:40] the swirl seven wonders
[1:00:42] these pagan influence and trappings were
[1:00:44] probably the reason why paul warned
[1:00:47] timothy to fight the good fight of faith
[1:00:50] to keep guard keep your guard up to keep
[1:00:53] that which had been committed to you
[1:00:55] amen to keep the word of god near and
[1:00:58] dear to your heart
[1:01:00] so from this background of the ephesus
[1:01:02] church you can start gleaning clues in
[1:01:06] chapter six and hints of what it meant
[1:01:08] to fight a good fight of faith
[1:01:13] well based on first timothy 6 you can go
[1:01:16] through this later and you can see it
[1:01:18] all down to the scriptures as he could
[1:01:20] come down and say fight the good fight
[1:01:22] of faith one would be in first timothy
[1:01:26] six and verse the first couple verses
[1:01:28] would be to maintain a godly character
[1:01:32] to fight the good fight of faith to
[1:01:35] maintain a good godly character no
[1:01:37] matter what the circumstances are
[1:01:40] no matter who's around you
[1:01:42] oh i got a godly character but yeah it's
[1:01:45] in church but what about when you're at
[1:01:46] school or work or what behind the scenes
[1:01:49] amen
[1:01:50] paul urges faithfulness to god no matter
[1:01:53] if you found yourself a rich man or
[1:01:56] slave
[1:01:58] he actually addresses both a rich man or
[1:02:01] a slave you were to conduct yourself no
[1:02:04] matter what as a son or daughter of god
[1:02:08] put me in remembrance brother man i'm
[1:02:09] talking about the slave the son of a
[1:02:11] king how he came over here you know and
[1:02:13] he
[1:02:14] he held himself in a different manner he
[1:02:16] acted a different way he didn't look
[1:02:18] like a normal slave and the man came to
[1:02:19] buy something he's like what's the
[1:02:21] difference do you feed him different do
[1:02:23] you do you treat him different he said
[1:02:25] no he eats with the rest of me
[1:02:27] i treat him just like everybody else he
[1:02:29] said well what makes that man different
[1:02:31] he said well i actually wondered that
[1:02:32] myself but one day i found out that man
[1:02:35] is the son of a king over there in
[1:02:37] africa
[1:02:38] and he said he presents himself or
[1:02:40] conducts himself as a son of a king
[1:02:44] come on somebody amen so it does not
[1:02:47] matter where you find yourself whether
[1:02:49] you got 100 bucks in the bank or no
[1:02:51] bucks in the bank or a million bucks in
[1:02:53] the bank you need to conduct yourself
[1:02:55] where you came from
[1:02:59] as a son of a king a daughter of a king
[1:03:07] it doesn't matter if he was in his
[1:03:08] father's kingdom or if he was a slave in
[1:03:11] a foreign land
[1:03:12] he was going to maintain his position
[1:03:14] i'm a son of a king
[1:03:17] come on somebody so it doesn't matter if
[1:03:19] you got a lot of money or no money or so
[1:03:21] but some money
[1:03:23] that ain't that has no bearings on who
[1:03:24] you are
[1:03:27] right
[1:03:28] it doesn't matter if you've got a lot of
[1:03:29] land no land or you rent some land
[1:03:32] it does not change who you are
[1:03:38] another one would be to reject false
[1:03:40] doctrines
[1:03:42] to stand there and be well rooted in the
[1:03:44] word so that when you seen these things
[1:03:46] come he would instruct timothy you want
[1:03:48] to fight the fight of faith you maintain
[1:03:51] a godly character and you reject false
[1:03:53] doctrines you don't play around with
[1:03:55] them
[1:03:56] you reject them and you stand with the
[1:03:58] word no matter how many comes
[1:04:06] he would also instruct him to seek
[1:04:07] godliness
[1:04:09] with contentment
[1:04:13] it means to draw satisfaction
[1:04:16] for by living a godly life
[1:04:18] as to pose
[1:04:20] to a world filled with goods
[1:04:24] our satisfaction is not from goods
[1:04:27] our joy should never be from earthly
[1:04:29] things
[1:04:31] because all of us gonna just burn
[1:04:35] only what's done for christ will last
[1:04:41] you know i i i'll say it like this what
[1:04:43] gives me joy
[1:04:45] or or a fondness or anything is not
[1:04:47] necessarily a picture of my mom or
[1:04:49] something that she used to have or
[1:04:51] anything like that
[1:04:52] what gives me joy is to know where she's
[1:04:55] at
[1:04:56] what gives me joy is to know i'm going
[1:04:59] to see her again
[1:05:01] that's eternal
[1:05:07] i was walking out my
[1:05:08] my door there
[1:05:10] off the patio walking down the dad's
[1:05:12] there i think it was friday morning
[1:05:14] of the weekend there and just talking to
[1:05:16] the lord and i just said mom one of
[1:05:18] these days i'm going to see you walk
[1:05:20] down this road
[1:05:23] you're not coming back in that old frail
[1:05:25] body as you was walking with a little
[1:05:26] stick trying to gain
[1:05:28] strength as you would walk and she'd
[1:05:30] walk down the mailbox you'd stop as i
[1:05:31] was building that that patio and sit
[1:05:34] there and watch me and and talk and
[1:05:36] things and i said you're not coming back
[1:05:38] like that
[1:05:40] but you're coming back in a whale body
[1:05:42] young body never to be like that again
[1:05:45] i'd walk in the dad's house and brother
[1:05:47] andrew spencer would hit me with a text
[1:05:49] and he said i'm praying for you this
[1:05:51] morning he said i want to let you know
[1:05:53] one of these days your mama's going to
[1:05:54] come walking down that road
[1:06:00] mercy me
[1:06:01] i'm looking for that
[1:06:03] matter of fact i think every morning
[1:06:04] i'll have me a cup of coffee out there
[1:06:09] amen because i believe it's any day now
[1:06:14] so we need to seek godliness with
[1:06:16] contentment in other words whatever
[1:06:19] state you find yourself he's but paul
[1:06:22] would say it like this he said you know
[1:06:23] he's lived
[1:06:25] paul personally lived out his principle
[1:06:26] and his principle in his life despite
[1:06:29] the hostility and lack he experienced he
[1:06:32] kept the faith
[1:06:33] he said in philippians 4 you'd say i
[1:06:35] know how to be brought low i know how to
[1:06:38] abound and any in every circumstance
[1:06:41] i've learned the secret of facing plenty
[1:06:43] i've learned of facing hunger and
[1:06:45] abundance and need i faced it every way
[1:06:51] he had the taste of both worlds he knew
[1:06:53] firsthand abundance and he knew what
[1:06:55] deprivation was
[1:06:57] that's why he would say with confidence
[1:06:59] godliness with contentment is gain
[1:07:08] another one he would struck would say no
[1:07:10] to the greed for riches
[1:07:15] for though he would say it there again
[1:07:17] but those who desire to be rich fall
[1:07:19] into temptation into a snare
[1:07:22] into many senseless and harmful desires
[1:07:24] that plunge people into ruin and
[1:07:26] destruction for the love of money is the
[1:07:28] root of all kinds of evil
[1:07:31] some people eager for money have
[1:07:33] wandered from the faith and
[1:07:35] pierced themselves with many griefs
[1:07:38] so
[1:07:39] how is the money a root of all evil
[1:07:42] it's the love of money
[1:07:44] it's putting that above god
[1:07:48] well i gotta have it to survive well
[1:07:50] you'd never put it before god
[1:07:52] because god will help you survive when
[1:07:54] money can't
[1:07:58] hey we got a scriptures for that
[1:08:01] we got the woman i got it here and and
[1:08:02] be certain of god the woman who was out
[1:08:05] there picking up her last couple of
[1:08:06] sticks and her last meal and last she
[1:08:09] didn't have money
[1:08:11] she would have if she'd have had money
[1:08:13] she probably couldn't have bought
[1:08:14] anything
[1:08:16] listen i don't know where we're going in
[1:08:17] this world but it seems to be crashing
[1:08:19] pretty hard
[1:08:21] and you can have all the money you want
[1:08:23] and it's a fine fine how to do but don't
[1:08:25] put your trust in it
[1:08:27] because it can be gone in a flash
[1:08:31] i don't know what all we're going to
[1:08:32] face
[1:08:35] as i said last year
[1:08:38] people was talking about how bad year
[1:08:39] 220 was to 2020.
[1:08:42] i'd say what do you think two you think
[1:08:44] 2021 is going to be any better
[1:08:46] and for me it wasn't
[1:08:49] is 2022 going to be any better
[1:08:53] i hope we can get past this pandemic
[1:08:55] listen we're going down to destruction
[1:08:57] this world is
[1:09:00] we shouldn't be surprised
[1:09:04] this world is being set up to be burned
[1:09:08] with unquenchable fire that sounds like
[1:09:10] destruction
[1:09:12] to the
[1:09:13] whatever degree
[1:09:16] there's not going to be nothing left
[1:09:21] as i said in 2020 the only thing that
[1:09:24] will make 2021 a better year is the
[1:09:27] rapture
[1:09:29] and it can still happen
[1:09:33] 2022 25 whatever we face the only thing
[1:09:36] that's going to make that a better year
[1:09:38] is the rapture
[1:09:40] and we better be prepared to leave here
[1:09:42] and you better fight with everything
[1:09:44] you've got to get on that boat
[1:09:51] i like i said before i
[1:09:53] that would have that would have been an
[1:09:55] army
[1:09:56] to keep me off the boat with noah
[1:10:00] because i mean because brother brown
[1:10:01] talks about what you are here is what
[1:10:02] you'll be there
[1:10:04] amen i tell you if i would have been
[1:10:06] there and i saw those supernatural
[1:10:07] things happening and all of a sudden out
[1:10:09] of the woods comes these animals walking
[1:10:11] two by two going into the ark
[1:10:14] i'm in line
[1:10:17] and ain't nobody keeping me off that
[1:10:19] boat
[1:10:20] and that ought to be our attitude saints
[1:10:22] if nobody else goes i'm going
[1:10:25] if nobody else is going to make it i'm
[1:10:27] going to make it
[1:10:28] i'm going to fight with everything i got
[1:10:31] i'm gonna lay aside every way every sin
[1:10:33] that was so easy to beset me and run
[1:10:37] run
[1:10:38] listen it's time to get yourself in high
[1:10:40] gear and push towards righteousness with
[1:10:43] all your hearts
[1:10:44] push towards holiness with all your
[1:10:46] heart push towards the body change with
[1:10:49] all your hearts
[1:10:52] that's right
[1:10:56] listen the bible and god is not the god
[1:10:59] in the bible is not against acquiring
[1:11:00] wealth
[1:11:02] it's against putting your confidence in
[1:11:04] your wealth
[1:11:10] it ain't against you being rich or you
[1:11:12] being wealthy or you being poor there
[1:11:14] was all kind of those in the bible
[1:11:16] but it's against you depending on that
[1:11:19] instead of depending on god
[1:11:22] there's plenty of examples of wealthy
[1:11:24] men through the bible abraham was very
[1:11:26] wealthy
[1:11:27] isaac jacob all those down
[1:11:29] joseph was right there at the site of
[1:11:30] pharaoh
[1:11:32] moses even had wealth
[1:11:36] at one time
[1:11:38] and all the i mean think about abraham
[1:11:40] was rich enough to feed
[1:11:42] about 318 battle-trained men not
[1:11:45] counting women and children daily from
[1:11:47] his table
[1:11:49] imagine how many sheeps and goats and
[1:11:50] cattle they slaughtered
[1:11:53] the fact that he could feed all of that
[1:11:55] proved he was a very wealthy man
[1:11:58] but abraham didn't put his confidence in
[1:12:00] his wealth he put it in his god
[1:12:03] because no amount of money was going to
[1:12:04] produce a body change
[1:12:07] the only thing was going to produce a
[1:12:08] body change is having faith and an
[1:12:11] unlimited god that god would produce and
[1:12:13] say do exactly what he said he would do
[1:12:20] paul would say it like this
[1:12:22] to those who would trust in their riches
[1:12:24] flee from these things pursue
[1:12:25] righteousness godliness faith love
[1:12:28] perseverance and gentleness another
[1:12:30] place keep your life free from the love
[1:12:32] of money and be content with what you
[1:12:34] have for he has said i will never leave
[1:12:37] you or forsake you
[1:12:39] money will leave you
[1:12:40] money will forsake you but he won't
[1:12:44] oh i don't know i'm a testify i can
[1:12:46] testify to that he promised me he came
[1:12:48] down in the fire and he's been with us
[1:12:50] every step of the way
[1:12:53] hallelujah he's never left us another
[1:12:56] one he would say is contest for the
[1:12:58] faith
[1:12:59] defend the faith fight for it
[1:13:03] you know this word contend was also a
[1:13:05] word that was actually used in different
[1:13:08] places as an athletic sense or in a race
[1:13:11] it was to contend for the faith to fight
[1:13:13] the good fight of faith was to contend
[1:13:16] to take hold to to give everything you
[1:13:19] got it would say it differently in other
[1:13:21] translations it would say run your best
[1:13:24] in the race of faith
[1:13:25] compete well in another translation
[1:13:28] strive earnestly another one would say
[1:13:30] exert all your strength and energy
[1:13:33] in other words don't leave nothing
[1:13:35] reserved in the tank
[1:13:37] give everything you got
[1:13:42] and this is what i would say to the
[1:13:43] young people is going to this camp you
[1:13:45] put everything you got into it
[1:13:48] every service make it the best service
[1:13:50] make it the most important service say
[1:13:52] god i come here for one thing and that's
[1:13:55] to get something from you
[1:13:56] you're going to have to fight for it you
[1:13:58] have to fight through all the other
[1:14:00] oppressions and spirits and things for
[1:14:02] there to be the right atmosphere but if
[1:14:04] you'll fight and you'll hold on and
[1:14:06] you'll say god i'm here for you he will
[1:14:08] respond to you
[1:14:11] he will touch you he will fill you with
[1:14:13] the holy ghost
[1:14:19] got a fight
[1:14:25] paul would say it let's even portray
[1:14:27] himself in this
[1:14:28] as being spiritually
[1:14:30] engaged or involved in a marathon
[1:14:33] as an athlete he said so i do not run
[1:14:36] aimlessly
[1:14:37] i do not box as one beat in the air but
[1:14:40] i discipline my body and keep it under
[1:14:43] control lest after preaching to others i
[1:14:46] myself should be disqualified or cast
[1:14:49] away
[1:14:50] the language used by paul is also is
[1:14:52] borrowed straight from
[1:14:54] athletics paul draws parallels between
[1:14:57] an athlete athlete's discipline and
[1:15:00] spiritual discipline
[1:15:02] athletes put their body through things
[1:15:05] why the physical body because they're
[1:15:06] fighting a physical race
[1:15:08] or they're running a physical race or
[1:15:10] they're they're doing fighting a
[1:15:11] physical fight they're they're training
[1:15:13] their body to take hits they're training
[1:15:15] their body to push it just a little
[1:15:17] harder than somebody else they're
[1:15:19] putting the right food they're doing
[1:15:20] everything they can why because they
[1:15:22] want to win a little medal around their
[1:15:24] throat
[1:15:27] to have the prestige for a few years of
[1:15:29] winning a medal
[1:15:33] want to matter
[1:15:36] great
[1:15:37] but that's not what we're in the raid
[1:15:38] this race for
[1:15:40] we're not in this race to get on the
[1:15:42] other side and say look what medal i won
[1:15:46] it's not a corruptable medal that one
[1:15:48] day will be sold in an auction or found
[1:15:50] in a trash pit somewhere or hanging on a
[1:15:53] wall somewhere or some decoration that's
[1:15:55] not what we're in this race for
[1:15:57] we're in this race in this fight not for
[1:16:00] a temporary crowd but for a crown of
[1:16:03] eternal life
[1:16:06] that's something worth fighting for
[1:16:08] that's worth something that's something
[1:16:10] worth putting your energies into
[1:16:12] [Applause]
[1:16:13] your heart into your life into
[1:16:16] everything you got and lay it all aside
[1:16:20] so i got a goal in mind
[1:16:23] my goal ain't a gold medal
[1:16:25] or bronze
[1:16:27] or silver
[1:16:28] my goal is eternal life
[1:16:35] paul would talk about the
[1:16:37] athletes and the crown as we said
[1:16:41] aspiring athletes would exercise and
[1:16:43] strive
[1:16:44] against themselves and against other
[1:16:46] competitors to win the ultimate victor's
[1:16:48] prize
[1:16:50] a crown
[1:16:51] made from the wreaths of garland leaves
[1:16:55] worn on a victor's head
[1:16:57] it's called a stephanos crown was a
[1:17:00] symbolic of a symbol of victory and
[1:17:03] exaltation in the athletic athletic
[1:17:05] world
[1:17:06] the fame and glory attached to it was
[1:17:09] enough motivation for athletes to endure
[1:17:11] hardships to endure intensive training
[1:17:14] for months to win a crown of leaves
[1:17:20] how many pick flowers
[1:17:24] they don't last that long
[1:17:26] these men would put themselves through
[1:17:28] hardships
[1:17:30] you can take a vase of flowers and have
[1:17:32] it in maybe a couple of weeks at best
[1:17:35] put in the refrigerator maybe keep it a
[1:17:36] little longer these men would run they
[1:17:38] would do they'd beat their bodies into
[1:17:40] subjection they would put their hearts
[1:17:42] in it to put this little wreath of
[1:17:45] leaves
[1:17:47] around their head
[1:17:49] and their chest would puff out for a few
[1:17:50] days
[1:17:53] and you can hardly name one of them now
[1:17:56] if you can
[1:18:02] but yet these other men
[1:18:05] that were seeking a city
[1:18:06] whose builder and maker with god you can
[1:18:09] still read their names
[1:18:18] paul would say that the christians are
[1:18:20] running a better race
[1:18:23] have a better aim
[1:18:25] it's the imperishable crown of
[1:18:27] righteousness
[1:18:30] it's a better aim and a better race to
[1:18:33] make the christian fight
[1:18:34] the good fight of faith
[1:18:38] with an aim with a goal with a keeping a
[1:18:40] discipline
[1:18:42] to keep your faith alive
[1:18:44] to keep holding on
[1:18:46] to keep going when the going gets rough
[1:18:49] to seem like you can't make another step
[1:18:51] you make another step why because
[1:18:53] there's a goal in mind
[1:18:54] it's called eternal life
[1:19:01] i mean i get amazed
[1:19:02] something like goals people get in line
[1:19:04] for days sometimes to get into a store
[1:19:07] on a black friday or something special
[1:19:10] camp out do all kinds of things fight
[1:19:14] think about the fights we witnessed over
[1:19:16] toilet paper
[1:19:19] seriously let's think about that a
[1:19:21] minute just a minute
[1:19:22] over toilet paper
[1:19:25] fight
[1:19:27] and you mean i can't fight for what i'm
[1:19:29] gonna tell what i'm going to obtain
[1:19:32] you mean i can't fight to have a
[1:19:34] spiritual service that my child can
[1:19:36] experience the same god i experienced in
[1:19:40] you mean i can't fight that my children
[1:19:42] my whole household can be saved
[1:19:45] and delivered and stand for
[1:19:47] righteousness and godliness and
[1:19:48] persevere through impossible situations
[1:19:51] yeah
[1:19:52] i can fight
[1:19:54] and we're going to fight
[1:20:00] a man named benjamin beckett would say
[1:20:02] it like this he said the christian
[1:20:04] is not permitted to float leisurely down
[1:20:06] the stream of the world
[1:20:08] and so reach the haven where his soul
[1:20:10] would be
[1:20:12] he must swim against the current
[1:20:14] and he must swim for his very life
[1:20:17] the faith which he professes with his
[1:20:19] lips
[1:20:20] he must adorn
[1:20:22] with his life
[1:20:24] the christian life is a battle against
[1:20:26] principalities and powers and darkness
[1:20:28] your faith will be tested and tried
[1:20:31] you will face stiff oppositions
[1:20:34] from the world and from people around
[1:20:36] you troubles trials tribulations
[1:20:38] temptations christ had this in mind when
[1:20:41] he said the kingdom of heaven suffereth
[1:20:44] violence but the violent taketh by force
[1:20:50] yeah there's going to be violence
[1:20:52] there's going to be fights against you
[1:20:53] but there's going to be something on the
[1:20:55] inside of you when the going gets rough
[1:20:57] and and you feel like i need to give up
[1:20:59] there's gonna be something to say nope
[1:21:01] this ain't the day for that take another
[1:21:03] step forward
[1:21:04] defeat another devil you've been called
[1:21:07] for this moment this is your moment
[1:21:19] paul
[1:21:21] he was living proof of what it means to
[1:21:22] fight the good fight of faith
[1:21:24] he was stoned at lystra but continued to
[1:21:27] witness
[1:21:29] he was shipwrecked but he continued
[1:21:31] serving god he was whipped and beated
[1:21:34] and beat and humiliated by whipping five
[1:21:37] times but he kept the faith
[1:21:40] paul's faith was tried and tested
[1:21:42] but nothing could hold him back
[1:21:45] he testified none of these things moved
[1:21:47] me
[1:21:47] neither count out my life dear unto
[1:21:49] myself so that i may might finish my
[1:21:52] course with joy and the ministry i've
[1:21:55] received to the lord jesus to testify
[1:21:57] the gospel of the grace of god he was
[1:22:00] unmoved in his belief that he declared
[1:22:02] none of these things move me
[1:22:07] but i kept the faith
[1:22:10] the good fight
[1:22:13] is good
[1:22:15] because in this fight
[1:22:17] god is glorified
[1:22:21] the good fight is good
[1:22:23] because it ultimately leads to eternal
[1:22:25] life
[1:22:29] to fight the good fight
[1:22:32] means you will move
[1:22:34] and continue to fight with everything
[1:22:37] that's in you no matter what the
[1:22:38] situation
[1:22:40] another one was to guard that sacred
[1:22:42] trust
[1:22:44] this word to guard that sacred trust has
[1:22:46] been given to you to avoid pretentious
[1:22:49] arguments to continue in prayer
[1:22:52] this was the fight in other words to
[1:22:54] fight the good fight of faith
[1:22:56] means to maintain it means maintaining a
[1:22:59] godly character even in forbidden and
[1:23:01] hostile circumstances it means to reject
[1:23:04] error and to produce pursue
[1:23:06] righteousness and godliness and faith
[1:23:08] and love and perseverance and gentleness
[1:23:10] fighting the good fight means to find
[1:23:12] joy and contentment in whatever god
[1:23:15] place god has given you rather than
[1:23:17] greed and money and riches it is the
[1:23:20] life
[1:23:21] it is to live your life above reproach
[1:23:24] and to bear a good report before
[1:23:25] believers and non-believers it is to
[1:23:28] guard the sacred trust and avoid
[1:23:30] pretentious arguments that seek to
[1:23:33] unsettle your faith in christ jesus
[1:23:37] it means to fight and keep on fighting
[1:23:40] and never quit
[1:23:44] as we said we could talk about the
[1:23:46] little woman who gathered that last meal
[1:23:49] she had to fight you talking about mind
[1:23:51] battles
[1:23:52] her little child's over there dying
[1:23:55] and all of a sudden then brother brandon
[1:23:56] would describe it he said a little man
[1:23:58] with a a skin lamb skin or something
[1:24:02] laid over and come walking up to the
[1:24:03] gate
[1:24:04] and said hey get me a drink
[1:24:08] and make me some bread
[1:24:13] she had to
[1:24:14] fight that wasn't the easiest thing
[1:24:18] to look at your kid and look at this man
[1:24:20] look at your kid and look at
[1:24:22] something on the inside of her
[1:24:24] realize something else is going on here
[1:24:27] something else is moving
[1:24:29] something else he said he broke around
[1:24:30] and said how horrible it was
[1:24:32] watching her little child die inch by
[1:24:34] inch
[1:24:36] she had prayed she had waited
[1:24:39] he said i can see her take her nap wake
[1:24:41] up look at that little thin body as it's
[1:24:43] getting thinner
[1:24:45] see those great ditches in his face from
[1:24:48] hunger she could hardly stagger around
[1:24:49] herself
[1:24:50] just about a bucket of water and one
[1:24:52] handful of meal and a spoonful of oil
[1:24:54] stood between her and death
[1:24:58] he said isn't that strange how god lets
[1:25:00] his children get right down to the last
[1:25:02] moment
[1:25:03] sometimes he permits to see permits that
[1:25:06] to see what your reaction will be
[1:25:09] will you continue to fight
[1:25:13] amen he said if we cannot stand the
[1:25:14] chastisement of god then we're
[1:25:17] illegitimate and not the children of god
[1:25:19] we're born but we're born of the spirit
[1:25:21] of god and our faith in god holds on to
[1:25:24] his word no matter what
[1:25:28] she goes to the kitchen she scrapes down
[1:25:29] the bottom of the barrel she gets a
[1:25:31] handful of meal said he'll wake up in a
[1:25:33] few minutes i got to cook this so he can
[1:25:34] have his last little breakfast
[1:25:37] she went
[1:25:38] out and there
[1:25:41] began to grab that meal
[1:25:46] said i'm going to make the last bit
[1:25:52] the prophet
[1:25:53] had come towards the city
[1:25:55] with a vision
[1:25:56] and he was trying to find a yard that
[1:25:59] had a woman in it
[1:26:02] mercy jesus
[1:26:06] i wonder if god's coming tonight to see
[1:26:08] if he still finds faith
[1:26:14] is there somebody that's still believing
[1:26:16] there's somebody that's still holding on
[1:26:18] an impossible situation
[1:26:20] there's somebody that hadn't given up
[1:26:22] yet
[1:26:24] he said it come as he walking down the
[1:26:26] streets
[1:26:27] before he's walking now down the street
[1:26:29] the vision that showed him
[1:26:31] and at the same time she's coming out of
[1:26:33] her house
[1:26:34] she picks up these sticks
[1:26:37] and she was going to build a little fire
[1:26:39] and put this little meal and oil on it
[1:26:41] to make a little piece of bread and she
[1:26:43] heard a voice and she turned
[1:26:45] and she hears that she sees this old
[1:26:47] bald-headed man leaning over a gate with
[1:26:49] a piece of sheepskin wrapped around him
[1:26:51] said would you fetch me just a drink of
[1:26:53] water
[1:26:55] he said what's that god-fearing person
[1:26:57] always willing to divide
[1:26:59] what they have
[1:27:02] she looked at him he was just a little
[1:27:04] different than lots of men there was
[1:27:05] something about a christian that's
[1:27:07] different
[1:27:08] he said i can imagine her saying the
[1:27:10] voice just sounds something different to
[1:27:12] me she nodded ahead in politeness that
[1:27:14] she'd get him some water and divide it
[1:27:16] with him and then she started to go she
[1:27:18] heard the voice again and said in your
[1:27:19] hand fetch me a little morsel of bread
[1:27:23] and it's no doubt tears began to come in
[1:27:25] her eyes
[1:27:26] said this is why i was out in the yard
[1:27:28] with these two sticks i got one little
[1:27:29] handful of meal one little spoonful of
[1:27:31] oil i mixed it together and dressed it i
[1:27:33] got these two sticks to make a fire we
[1:27:35] was going to eat and die
[1:27:37] he said but first make me a cake
[1:27:40] brother brown said see
[1:27:41] seek ye first the kingdom of god
[1:27:44] and his righteousness and all things
[1:27:46] will be added unto you put god first
[1:27:50] put his word first and you're going to
[1:27:52] have to fight to do that
[1:27:54] in this age that we're living in you're
[1:27:56] going to have to fight to put god's word
[1:27:57] first
[1:28:00] bring me some little cakes
[1:28:07] she said
[1:28:09] she would
[1:28:11] she turned
[1:28:13] and started the house
[1:28:16] and as she turned to go to the house
[1:28:18] she heard that voice speak again and
[1:28:20] said thus saith the lord the barrel will
[1:28:23] not be empty neither the crews run dry
[1:28:25] until the day of the lord god sends
[1:28:27] water upon the earth again she was
[1:28:30] willing but she had to fight
[1:28:33] and she put god first
[1:28:36] and god
[1:28:37] did something for her he'd say like they
[1:28:39] said many times
[1:28:41] disappointments and trouble strikes our
[1:28:43] home
[1:28:45] he said it's a blessing in disguise
[1:28:48] sometimes it's hard to see how is this a
[1:28:50] blessing
[1:28:52] why would he say that because paul said
[1:28:54] all things work together
[1:28:56] for the good to them that are the called
[1:28:58] according to the word of god so it has
[1:29:00] to be a blessing
[1:29:02] or it can't be good
[1:29:04] come on now
[1:29:06] i know we're slowing down a minute
[1:29:10] he said but many times trouble strikes
[1:29:12] our home and we wonder how is this a
[1:29:14] blessing
[1:29:16] some people might say well you're sick
[1:29:18] just because you're not right with god
[1:29:19] that don't mean that
[1:29:21] job was right with god and he was sick
[1:29:24] but many times it's god testing you
[1:29:26] putting you to a test to see what you'll
[1:29:28] do maybe let the doctor say that was for
[1:29:31] a purpose and see what you'll do
[1:29:33] we're nearing the coming of the lord god
[1:29:35] is coming for a church
[1:29:37] he never asked him question will i have
[1:29:39] a church will i have righteousness but
[1:29:41] he asked will i find faith
[1:29:46] will i find faith when i come god is
[1:29:49] putting you to test to try your faith
[1:29:54] in all her trouble and death that the
[1:29:56] door turned with one thus saith the lord
[1:30:05] she had many hindrances
[1:30:07] but she fought
[1:30:09] brother brandon would talk about the
[1:30:10] serophonician woman and we're not going
[1:30:11] to go into all of that tonight but how
[1:30:14] that she had to fight
[1:30:15] to get to him and then when she got to
[1:30:18] him he turns around and said i'm not
[1:30:19] even sent to your race
[1:30:23] that'd have been a good opportunity to
[1:30:24] say okay i'm sorry and go home
[1:30:27] but not this woman there was some fight
[1:30:29] in her
[1:30:33] she would cry out and he said i it's not
[1:30:35] rightful to give the bread amen to the
[1:30:37] dogs
[1:30:39] that have been another good opportunity
[1:30:41] to turn around and go home
[1:30:43] but there was not this woman there was
[1:30:45] some fight in her
[1:30:48] oh the preacher hurt my feelings i'm
[1:30:49] going to go home and pout and tell
[1:30:51] everybody how terribly what not this
[1:30:53] woman
[1:30:54] it was some fight in her but even the
[1:30:57] dogs get the crumbs
[1:31:03] brother brown said i'm a crumb seeker
[1:31:06] he said i want everything that god would
[1:31:08] have for me if it's just a little crumb
[1:31:10] i want it
[1:31:12] and i'm going to fight to get it
[1:31:14] whatever it is on a wednesday night or a
[1:31:16] sunday or during the week when god was
[1:31:18] there and he just puts out a little
[1:31:20] crumb you got to fight but it'll be
[1:31:22] worth it all
[1:31:24] it'll give you strength for the journey
[1:31:26] it'll give you life inside of you to
[1:31:28] take another step to push a little
[1:31:30] harder and say i'm not stopping i'm not
[1:31:32] sitting down i'm not wallowing around in
[1:31:34] my wowzy wowsy wooz but i've been called
[1:31:36] for this moment
[1:31:38] and i'm going to stand and when i've
[1:31:40] done all i can do i'm going to stand
[1:31:42] therefore
[1:31:44] and i'm going to fight
[1:31:55] think of it like this
[1:31:58] there's many services sister karen led a
[1:32:00] bunch of charges
[1:32:02] run around this church
[1:32:04] inspire a lot of people
[1:32:06] here and on the internet
[1:32:08] to see her and her place and her
[1:32:10] condition and things she was going
[1:32:11] through to fight through it
[1:32:15] i told her
[1:32:16] at the end mama i didn't know you was
[1:32:17] such a warrior
[1:32:19] she was a warrior
[1:32:21] i want to be that kind of warrior
[1:32:24] that'll fight through impossible odds
[1:32:27] that'll fight through hormones and fight
[1:32:29] through amen brain bleed six of them
[1:32:32] fight
[1:32:33] fight
[1:32:35] she fought the good fight of
[1:32:38] faith now she's in that cloud of
[1:32:41] witnesses
[1:32:43] understand just sometimes some years ago
[1:32:45] in a skit at her youth camp she stood in
[1:32:47] that banister
[1:32:50] given the charge to fight we didn't know
[1:32:52] that that was going to come to fruition
[1:32:53] but she's there tonight
[1:32:55] and if we could hear her voice she'd say
[1:32:57] even light don't you give up
[1:33:00] don't you stop
[1:33:02] don't you stop worshiping god don't you
[1:33:04] let those critics and things that tell
[1:33:06] you that ain't right and that's a bunch
[1:33:08] of holy rolling stuff and that's a bunch
[1:33:09] of fanaticism don't you stop because
[1:33:12] there is a land that is far beyond your
[1:33:14] imagination it's worth fighting for
[1:33:18] it's worth going for it's worth laying
[1:33:20] aside everything that you're going
[1:33:23] through and say i must fight if i must
[1:33:25] reign increase my courage lord
[1:33:29] how many would say lord give me
[1:33:31] something within me that no matter what
[1:33:33] i go through what challenges i face i am
[1:33:37] going to fight with everything i got to
[1:33:39] you don't know
[1:33:41] you don't know when that last hill is
[1:33:43] going to be here you don't know when
[1:33:44] that last curve's coming you don't know
[1:33:47] when that last devil's going to be in
[1:33:49] front of you and you take his head off
[1:33:51] and right behind him is the eternal
[1:33:53] gates of heaven
[1:33:56] and it will be worth it all every tear
[1:33:59] every fight every struggle every time
[1:34:02] you lay in your bed and you cried why
[1:34:04] god it'll be worth it all right
[1:34:14] you got to have some perseverance about
[1:34:15] you
[1:34:18] i'm just going to tell you you better
[1:34:20] buckle up
[1:34:23] pull up that
[1:34:24] that buckle on you
[1:34:29] brother josh the other day would say on
[1:34:31] a minister's
[1:34:32] uh a chat
[1:34:34] there he said it's time to take the
[1:34:36] sword out of the sheath and never put it
[1:34:38] back
[1:34:42] we'll lay our armor down one day but
[1:34:43] today ain't the
[1:34:45] but one day we'll lay it over on the
[1:34:47] sides of glory
[1:34:49] and lay our shields and our swords down
[1:34:51] never to fight again
[1:34:54] but until that day
[1:34:55] i'm gonna fight
[1:34:58] i'm gonna fight discouragement
[1:35:00] i'm gonna fight mind battles
[1:35:02] i'm gonna fight spirits of every kind of
[1:35:04] hell that would come against the bride
[1:35:05] of jesus christ intellectual demons that
[1:35:08] wants to rise up and say it can't be
[1:35:09] that our children can have an experience
[1:35:11] with the holy ghost i'm gonna fight
[1:35:13] against that
[1:35:17] i'm going to fight against formalism
[1:35:20] i'm going to fight against sauls
[1:35:23] stand against them and say it ain't so
[1:35:26] it wasn't so from the beginning
[1:35:39] it's worth going to
[1:35:43] i'm so thankful to have this
[1:35:45] experience
[1:35:47] to tell me that this land is real
[1:35:51] brother branham would say it like this
[1:35:52] as we bring this down to a close
[1:35:59] he said he had an experience he said
[1:36:00] it's changed me
[1:36:03] he said i can't be the same brother
[1:36:05] branham that i was
[1:36:09] he said he'd woke up from a dream and
[1:36:11] kind of kicked his head back on the
[1:36:13] headboard and put his hands behind his
[1:36:14] head
[1:36:15] thinking about his life
[1:36:19] you know here i am 50 years old and
[1:36:20] hadn't done nothing for the lord
[1:36:24] where's that put us
[1:36:27] he said all of a sudden he heard
[1:36:29] something kept saying
[1:36:31] you're just starting
[1:36:33] press the battle
[1:36:35] keep pressing the battle so i shook my
[1:36:37] head a minute i thought well probably
[1:36:39] just thinking this you know a person can
[1:36:41] get some imaginations i'd probably just
[1:36:43] imagine they imagine that
[1:36:46] and here come again press the battle
[1:36:48] keep going keep going keep going i said
[1:36:52] man maybe maybe i said that he said so
[1:36:54] he put his lips between his teeth and
[1:36:57] his hand over his mouth
[1:36:59] and there it came again just keep
[1:37:00] pressing on
[1:37:02] if he only knew what was at the end of
[1:37:04] the road
[1:37:08] it seemed like i could hear graham
[1:37:10] snellings or somebody that sang the song
[1:37:12] like this they sang it here
[1:37:14] all of you know i'm homesick and blue
[1:37:17] and i want to see jesus i would like to
[1:37:20] hear those sweet harbor bells chime
[1:37:23] it would brighten my path
[1:37:25] and vanish all fears
[1:37:27] lord let me look past the curtain of
[1:37:29] time
[1:37:30] i said you've heard it saying here at
[1:37:31] church
[1:37:32] heard somebody say would you like to see
[1:37:34] just beyond the curtain i said it would
[1:37:36] help me so much
[1:37:39] and i looked in just a moment one breath
[1:37:41] i came into a little place that was
[1:37:43] slanted and i looked back and there i
[1:37:45] was laying on the bed and i said wow
[1:37:47] this is strange
[1:37:49] he said this is before my church my
[1:37:51] sheep that i'm pastoring whether i was
[1:37:53] in this body or out whether it was a
[1:37:55] translation it wasn't like any vision i
[1:37:57] ever had
[1:37:58] i hit that little place
[1:38:00] seen so many people come running and
[1:38:02] screaming oh our precious brother
[1:38:04] and i looked and young women maybe in
[1:38:06] their early 20s they were throwing their
[1:38:08] arms around me screaming our precious
[1:38:10] brother
[1:38:12] oh mercy
[1:38:13] here come young men and the brilliance
[1:38:15] of young manhood and their eyes
[1:38:17] glistening
[1:38:18] looking like stars on the darkest night
[1:38:21] and their teeth as white as pearl and
[1:38:23] they were screaming and grabbing me and
[1:38:25] screaming oh our precious brother and i
[1:38:28] stopped and looked and i was young i
[1:38:30] looked back at my whole body laying
[1:38:31] there with my hands behind my head i
[1:38:33] said i don't understand this
[1:38:35] he said when young women were throwing
[1:38:36] their arms around me so i realized
[1:38:38] there's a mixed audience and he said i
[1:38:39] say this with sweetness and melaness of
[1:38:41] spirit man can i put your arm around a
[1:38:43] woman without a human sensation but it
[1:38:45] wasn't there
[1:38:46] there was no yesterday there was no
[1:38:48] tomorrow they didn't get tired so i've
[1:38:51] never seen such pretty women in all my
[1:38:52] life they had hair down to their
[1:38:54] waistline waistline long skirts their
[1:38:57] feet they were just hugging me and i
[1:38:59] wasn't hugged like even my own sister
[1:39:00] seeing there would hug me they were not
[1:39:02] kissing me i wouldn't was not kissing
[1:39:04] them or something he said i i don't even
[1:39:07] have the vocabulary i haven't got enough
[1:39:10] words i can say it perfection wouldn't
[1:39:12] touch it superb wouldn't describe it
[1:39:15] you just have to be there
[1:39:18] hello
[1:39:20] you just have to be there i looked this
[1:39:22] way in that way and they were coming by
[1:39:24] the
[1:39:24] thousands and here come hope
[1:39:27] my first wife she run over she never
[1:39:29] said my husband she said my precious
[1:39:32] brother when she hugged me there was
[1:39:33] another woman standing there to hug me
[1:39:35] and hope hug this woman and each one
[1:39:37] this is something different i thought it
[1:39:39] can't be as some
[1:39:41] oh
[1:39:42] and i thought my
[1:39:43] i don't ever want to go back to that old
[1:39:45] carcass again
[1:39:47] here's a man 50 years old he's not
[1:39:50] laying there with a brain bleed
[1:39:53] he's not laying there in a decrepit
[1:39:54] situation
[1:39:56] he's still got years on his life
[1:40:00] he could live for years
[1:40:03] but he said i don't want to go back to
[1:40:05] that old carcass
[1:40:08] i looked around and i thought what is
[1:40:09] this
[1:40:10] i look real good i said i can't
[1:40:12] understand it hope seemed to be like a
[1:40:14] guest of honor or something
[1:40:16] but not really different but like a
[1:40:18] guest of honor in other words she stood
[1:40:19] out something was different said i heard
[1:40:21] a voice then that spoke to me that was
[1:40:23] in the room and said this is what you
[1:40:25] preached
[1:40:26] was the holy ghost this is perfect love
[1:40:28] and nothing can enter without it
[1:40:32] and i am more determined than ever in my
[1:40:34] life
[1:40:35] that it takes perfect love to enter
[1:40:38] there there's no jealousy there's no
[1:40:40] tiredness there's no death sickness can
[1:40:42] never get there mortality can never make
[1:40:44] you old you'll never cry it's just one
[1:40:47] joy oh my precious brother they took me
[1:40:50] up and set me on a great big high place
[1:40:52] and i thought i'm not dreaming i'm
[1:40:53] looking back at my body laying on the
[1:40:55] bed i said i shouldn't set up here and
[1:40:57] one one here come women and men from
[1:40:59] side just in the bloom of you screaming
[1:41:01] oh my precious brother we're so happy to
[1:41:03] see you here i said i don't understand
[1:41:05] this and the voice said you know it's
[1:41:07] written in the bible that the prophets
[1:41:09] are together with their people i see i
[1:41:11] remember that why this is when you will
[1:41:13] be gathered with your people
[1:41:15] i said then they'll be real
[1:41:17] and i can feel them oh yes
[1:41:19] there's millions
[1:41:21] there's not that many branhams he said
[1:41:23] they're not branhams
[1:41:24] they're your converts that's the one you
[1:41:27] led to the lord i said some of them
[1:41:29] women they said and that boy said some
[1:41:31] of them women there you think are so
[1:41:32] beautiful were better than 90 years old
[1:41:34] when you led them to the lord no wonder
[1:41:36] they're screaming oh my precious brother
[1:41:39] they screamed all at once if you hadn't
[1:41:41] went we wouldn't be here
[1:41:44] and i looked around and thought well i
[1:41:45] don't get it where's jesus i want to see
[1:41:47] jesus said he's a little higher right up
[1:41:50] the way someday he'll come
[1:41:52] but you're sent to be a leader and god
[1:41:54] will come when he does he'll judge you
[1:41:56] according to what you taught
[1:41:57] first whether they go in or not we all
[1:42:00] go in according to your teaching
[1:42:02] i said oh i'm so glad that paul had to
[1:42:05] stand like this does peter have to stand
[1:42:07] like this said yes and i preached every
[1:42:09] word that they preached i never divided
[1:42:11] from it one side or the other were they
[1:42:13] baptized in the name of jesus christ i
[1:42:16] baptized them the name of jesus christ
[1:42:18] where they taught the baptism of the
[1:42:19] holy ghost i did too
[1:42:22] whatever they taught i did too then
[1:42:24] people screamed back we know that and we
[1:42:27] are resting on that
[1:42:31] we know we're going with you someday
[1:42:32] back to earth jesus will come and you'll
[1:42:35] be judged according to the word that you
[1:42:36] preached to us
[1:42:38] then if you're accepted which you will
[1:42:40] be
[1:42:42] hallelujah then you will present us to
[1:42:44] him as your trophies of your ministry
[1:42:46] and you will guide us to him all
[1:42:48] together as we gather we go back to
[1:42:50] earth to live forever
[1:42:52] i said do i have to return back now
[1:42:55] hearing his voice do i have to return
[1:42:57] back to a healthy body
[1:43:00] do i have to return back now
[1:43:03] to a wife laying beside him to children
[1:43:06] in the bed
[1:43:08] do i have to return back now
[1:43:12] yes
[1:43:13] but keep pressing on
[1:43:16] i looked and i could see people coming
[1:43:18] as far still as wanting to hug me
[1:43:20] screaming our precious brother then the
[1:43:22] voice that all that you've loved never
[1:43:24] loved will be god will give it to you
[1:43:25] he's seen his horse and he's seen his
[1:43:27] little dog
[1:43:28] i felt myself move from that little
[1:43:30] beautiful place and looked around and
[1:43:32] said are you awake
[1:43:33] honey she was still asleep and i thought
[1:43:35] oh god help me
[1:43:37] never let me compromise with one word
[1:43:41] let me stay straight right on that word
[1:43:44] and preach it i don't care what comes or
[1:43:46] goes how many souls rise how many sons
[1:43:49] of kiss rise how many this or that or
[1:43:51] another lord let me press with all my
[1:43:55] heart into that place
[1:43:57] [Applause]
[1:43:58] hallelujah i've never got to experience
[1:44:00] that but that there's good enough for me
[1:44:02] and if he had that desired vision in
[1:44:04] there i have that same desire
[1:44:06] god let me press with everything i got
[1:44:10] into that place
[1:44:12] do you have that same desire tonight i
[1:44:14] wonder how many would say lord i want to
[1:44:16] fight the good fight of faith i want to
[1:44:19] pick up my sword again i want to fight a
[1:44:21] little harder i want to go a little

[1:44:28] you i want to give more of myself in
[1:44:30] service unto you

[1:44:33] stand to your feet and say lord that's
[1:44:35] me

[1:44:39] i want to go a little harder father with
[1:44:40] all my heart

[1:44:48] i want to go with all that's in me
[1:44:51] hallelujah
[1:44:54] oh hallelujah he said all fear of death
[1:44:57] is now gone
[1:44:58] as i say this with my bible before me i
[1:45:01] got a little boy about four years old to
[1:45:02] be raised nine-year-old girl teenager
[1:45:04] i'm thankful for this turned the way of
[1:45:06] the lord god let me live to bring them
[1:45:08] up in the admonition of god
[1:45:10] above that the whole world seems to
[1:45:12] scream to me ninety-year-old women and
[1:45:14] men of all kinds if you hadn't went we
[1:45:16] wouldn't have been there and said oh god
[1:45:18] let me press the battle let me press the
[1:45:21] battle he said but when it comes to
[1:45:23] dying i am no more afraid
[1:45:26] it would be a joy it would be a pleasure
[1:45:29] to enter from this corruption and
[1:45:31] disgrace into that incorruption if you
[1:45:34] if i could make up you under a hunt 100
[1:45:36] billion miles high a square block that's
[1:45:38] perfect love each step this way in
[1:45:40] heralds until we get down to where we
[1:45:41] are now that's what would be just merely
[1:45:43] a shadow of corruption that's a little
[1:45:45] something we can sense and feel if he
[1:45:47] said oh my precious friends my begotten
[1:45:49] children of god listen to me he said i
[1:45:51] wish there was some way i could explain
[1:45:53] it i wish i could find the words it's
[1:45:55] not found anyway but just beyond this
[1:45:57] last breath
[1:45:59] is the most glorious thing you've ever
[1:46:02] experienced it he said there's no way to
[1:46:05] explain it there's no way to comprehend
[1:46:08] it until you've been there
[1:46:14] let's fight the good fight of faith
[1:46:16] let's press the battle
[1:46:18] that's what the grandstands are
[1:46:20] screaming
[1:46:21] press it
[1:46:22] press it
[1:46:23] press it
[1:46:26] for without us they are not made perfect

[1:50:08] walk away the lord we know that ain't
[1:50:10] true we'd have to fight
[1:50:13] the devil will still be fighting in

[1:50:18] but lord that's not our calling that's
[1:50:19] not who we are
[1:50:21] we've been called to the battlefield
[1:50:23] we've been called to as soldiers of the
