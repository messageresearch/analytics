each one's brought our licks of Fire and expecting that the Lord would do according to his his promise that he would meet us here this evening amen we're looking forward to the ministering of the word brother Timothy is going to come preach what the lord has laid on his heart and we're going to receive it as from the Lord amen we just want to go to prayer at this time there's several needs that we want to make mention to the congregation the Wilson family puts in a request for their nephew Matthew Wheeler he is having seizures so I want to ask that the church would pray for Matthew Wheeler tonight also to pray for brother Sarah Palais from South Africa he has a tumor on his stomach a blood clot on his lung the doctor said that there's no more that they can do because the cancer has spread into his spine most of all he's in need of Salvation so we wouldn't want to remember that need tonight we do want to remember especially sister Erica Parker tonight of course brother Ron Spencer but sister Erica is really really weak and in need of a supernatural touch that only God can bring medicine can take you so far as We Know but it's the Lord Jesus the Healer that needs to step on the scene for her today so we just want to remember those needs how many would have a need on your heart as brother Aaron would come and lead us in prayer tonight brother Aaron [Music] Lord when we come tonight humbly Lord God recognize your presence in this place recognizing Lord that Lord You're Here amongst your people once again to speak father Lord how awesome it is to have a king Lord that is our comforter and that is our friend Lord we come tonight Lord with Thanksgiving in our heart we come just Overjoyed at the opportunity to once again be in your house Lord with with fellow Believers of light precious faith and I I pray tonight Lord there not be one that would take this opportunity for granted Lord Lord an opportunity to worship you an opportunity to let the word changes in your presence Lord Lord even as as I was looking at some things today in your word recognizing that that father even seeing that the word is truth will do us no good if we don't allow it to wash over us and change us and and allow ourselves to be molded by the word of God and tonight we're asking that each one of us that all our barriers would be broken down our own self ideas and how we feel about things and we'll allow the the word of God to move deep down into our heart and and begin to change Us From the Inside Out father a supernatural touch that goes beyond any head knowledge or any knowing within ourselves but Lord that you come and do an incredible work in our hearts that's what we're looking forward to tonight and expecting father and Lord we gather as people with great needs Lord as as many people have needs but tonight Lord we're thankful that we have a God who knows and cares and who provides Lord you heard the need for sister Erica and we know you know all about it we're just asking tonight Lord that you'll go and not only strengthen her Lord we're not just looking for a temporary strengthening Lord although I ask that that happened now but we're looking Beyond temporary Lord and we're believing that you are the Healer that can come and completely eradicate this cancer that can drive it out Lord we've seen it too many times Lord we will not doubt now but will stand upon the promises tonight lord lord for sister Erica for for brother Ron for brother Ross for sister Danette the different ones who are going through Health struggles Lord we stand tonight and we believe that we will see the Fulfillment of a healing in those lives father Lord you heard the request that came tonight for for the young man there with the seizures Lord I must ask that you'll come Lord that you'll drive that out and the root cause of it be driven out Lord that he can live a healthy life and for the man in South Africa Lord first and foremost I ask that you get a hold of his soul father Lord that you'll use this situation For Your Glory to to see a soul save and snatch from the jaws of Satan even in this last moments father but if you do Lord see fit Lord and you move upon his life I'm asking that you'll heal his body as well father that's what we would love to see is just the miraculous Lord not for our Glory but For Your Glory knowing that you are the Savior and You Are the Healer and there is nothing too hard for our God lord we ask now that you take control role of this service that you'll speak to every heart directly throughout the entire course of it father we put it in your hands now in Jesus name we pray amen you're standing for just another moment or so the deacons wouldn't mind receiving the offering and he ties this evening we'd certainly appreciate that how many enjoy serving in the body of Christ amen It's a Wonderful privilege we do have an announcement um I do want to sing he was wounded for our transgressions if you don't mind playing that [Music] how many know to receive the benefits of a sacrifice in the Old Testament I actually had to lay on to it they had to accept it that he was wounded that lamb that died was for their transgressions for their sins and I believe we've been given a lamb a lamb for a house lamb for a home amen [Music] are they still having a meeting for the skit after I think there's a meeting okay so if you're interested in being involved in the the camp skit coming up in Youth Camp why don't you stay after the service this evening just as we're dismissed and we'll have a meeting

never a song [Music] songs with the Lord and remember [Music] [Music] [Music] was enabled to carry you through [Applause] [Music] [Music] there was ever a song [Music] through the impossible if you

know the roads look the same he gave me instructions but I disregard it in change but then sudden destruction [Music] oh it soon came my way [Music] and I have to say I've only got me to play oh cause he never left me though I turned my back on him I was living in a world of sin and I was trying to run away again oh but he never left me hey when I chose to walk away even when I couldn't pray you know he never left me and I chose the wrong road because it looked good to me and I walk blindly onward you know I just couldn't see oh cause I was lost and I was dying over now I'm trying you know I reached out to Jesus you know he reached out to me cause he never left me [Music] though I turned mine back on here I was living in a world and I was trying to run away again [Applause] oh but he

we just want to say how much we love you and how much we appreciate you Lord for all that you've done in our lives Lord you've been so good to us Lord you kept us Lord Amazing Grace has brought us safe this far Amazing Grace will lead us on Lord we just ask father tonight that you would touch hearts and touch lives and Lord we just ask God your minister to needs and situations is only you can do we love you with all of our hearts now if there be anything we've done Lord that would be displeasing we ask God that you would forgive us and wash us and cleanse us Lord and Phyllis Lord in those places we pray in Jesus name amen let's turn the Bibles to Hebrews chapter 4. verse 12. amen we want to mention that uh there's a youth service or a Bible study Friday night at six o'clock here at the church so if you'd like to be a part of that one welcome to come to that amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord hey man we got the weave family brother Dave sister Helen all the week up in Saskatoon just was with him a few days ago and drove all the way down here man that's got to be quite a drive amen but I guess it's worth it to see a grandchild hey man that's what they're here for a man right brother Charlie worth a drive to see a grandchild took me three days to remember Sister Rachel's name amen we're halfway to 90. but we're glad to be here I want to welcome you also sister Rachel and amen and I'm so glad to to be together once again Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 12 it says for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit now the joints of Morrow and there's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open under the eyes of him with whom we have to do amen we let you be seated this evening I'd like to speak to you again on the discerner amen I'm glad he's still the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart I I'm glad to serve a God who knows my name and he knows my situations and he knows uh where I'm at and what what I'm dealing with amen maybe maybe sometimes we think uh you know different ones well we know different ones doesn't know US president of the United States don't know us or hardly knows his self but anyway uh he doesn't know our name he doesn't know um you know who we are or any of his cabinet or any of that but that that matters not doesn't matter that Kings doesn't know our name or or our great consent men considered Great Men of this time would know our name it matters not what matters is he knows our name and he knows exactly where we are in every moment of our lives and and I found that to be so very early in the in my ministry as I was with uh brother Danny steaming down in South America one time and down in the jungle and you know and you you get down in those places you you wonder sometimes if if you're forgotten and you wonder if God's thinking about you and and you hear about troubles at home you know my Papa butts was having some heart situations at that time and was maybe looking at surgery and was dealing with all kind of mind battles and not much I mean not being able to communicate at home very much or to home very much and and so I was there and and we found our self in this spot early one morning coming unannounced to a village I told you this story but it's just something that I I fall back on a lot to remember that God knows where I'm at and who I am and and so we found ourselves pulling off the off the river into the Little Creek bed as it were and and not knowing if this Village would even be there this this tribe of Indians and but really felt on our heart to go and here we we come to this place and and out of the Jungle steps this white-haired Chief and and here he was he's beginning to holler out and scream out and just shout and and just rejoice and as I would find out later that the Lord has spoke to him in a dream and an angel had appeared to him and said go to the mouth of the creek I have three white men bringing fire and it happened to me brother Daniel brother Jackie Benton that was there and and so God knew how many we were he knew who we were and he knew the time that we would show up amen we could have showed up any time that week but that man was waiting there for that moment why because the word is still the discerner he knows every detail of our lives and sometimes that gets lost in our human thinking and our human thoughts that that there could be a being or somebody that can know every minute detail of our lives but you know when the word is speaking you have to recognize that first it's God speaking you know it's very easy to just put it off as being well that's brother so and so or that's sister so and so it just said that but when you recognize God speaking to you them not only that that is God speaking to you but he's coming and he's Discerning amen your heart and your need not only is God speaking but God is speaking to you amen it's easy to know sometimes yeah that was a great service God spoke but sometimes we fail to recognize God was trying to speak to us God was trying to speak to me as an individual and I put it off on something else and he's there Discerning the hearts you know it's easy it's a very easy in in a meeting with a I mean you know a couple of hundred people sitting around you to say you know well that was just for somebody else or that was that was for them or that was for that over there but you know the devil is always trying to get you to miss your moment he's trying to get you to miss your service he's trying to get you to miss your time and you know we're we're real good about coming to church with a pitchfork right and we pitch it over here and we pitch it over there what is he doing he's trying to get you to miss when God is speaking directly to you amen he don't care if you recognize God it's speaking necessarily he doesn't care if you recognize God is speaking to someone as long as you don't recognize God is speaking to me and when he when he did when he does when you do recognize then he tries to to hinder your response to what God has said and he tries to make it to where you say well maybe I'll wait a little longer or I'll uh maybe next service or maybe next week or maybe maybe another time I'll talk to brother Tim or maybe another time I'll do this see Satan is always trying his best to hinder you in every part of your life and so if he can do that he can hinder you and then you'll very soon begin to discount it as be in God's voice you'll discount it as being something from God and you say well that just happened to be that way and that just happened you know we can rationalize all kinds of things in our mind but if we will if we were by faith realize God has answered and God has not only answered he's answered me and he's speaking to my heart he's touching my life and therefore I have a response he demands a response back to him amen so I I was just looking on this thought of our response and and brother Branham says in demonology he said they told me last night that I was speaking to a certain person and that person did not respond to the call he said now that's pretty dangerous that's pretty dangerous he said I watched the angels of the Lord when he's standing here he said I can feel him when he moves and I I feel it move over me and move from me and I watch and it'll leave me and it'll go somewhere else and it'll stand there a little bit and I can see it and it'll flash over and all of a sudden a vision will come and then I see a vision I watch what kind of person it's around there and I'll find that person then I'll sit and then I'll begin to speak that's what takes place that's what happens it's all in the spiritual realm he said but if that person don't respond it'll be like reading the Bible here and saying there's nothing to it and walking away from it Mercy if that person does not respond it'll be as though he was reading the Bible and says there's nothing to it and walking away from it so that makes it pretty bad so always be on alert always be listening always be watching and when he speaks you answer amen I believe that goes for every service amen if we truly believe that God through the foolishness of Spear of preaching can take a man and anoint his his life and anoint his heart and that gift of God on the inside of him he said well I don't know about that well I mean you either Believe it or you don't believe it amen if you don't believe it I don't know why you're sitting here tonight but if you truly believe it amen that God can take a man so then then God can take that man and anoint that man then I think we ought to have the responsibility that when God speaks we respond to it amen something on the inside of us responds it's a deep they calleth unto the Deep there's got to be a deep to respond amen there's got to be something God is looking not only to to speak he's also looking to see if you respond amen and so he said so my wife and brother Beeler many of them this morning was telling me about it that I was calling a man about his brother somewhere that is something done something wrong and so forth and that man did not respond to the call so that can't be helped now that's between God and the man the vision left me and I couldn't find it no more because he didn't answer so be watching and be on alert amen you said well I tell you what it would be wonderful for the prophet of God to stand here tonight and begin to call my my situation and call me out and begin to detail my life and and surely I would have a response listen you would have the same response to the prophet of God and discernment as you would have sitting here tonight with the word going forth and God began to talk to your heart you're either going to respond or you're not going to respond he said well I don't see how anybody could miss when God is calling out details and they can see themselves in scriptures well I got plenty of them here tonight that there was plenty of them that were missing it amen and if you was there sitting there and hearing it and hearing what would your situation being called out and there wasn't no response out of you to acknowledge it to say yes Lord to say Amen Lord to say so be it Lord amen then you are missing it amen amen you know uh you the brother Brown talks about the picture of Christ that went before he said to all pictures you know has to go before critics and and this critic came and walked up to an artist and called him by name said you have a most unusual picture of Our Lord I think that profile is perfect he said I think of him coming by night and a lantern in his hand that it speaks of him coming in our darkness in the night I think all that's wonderful and then him standing in his expression on his face anxiously waiting to see if someone will respond to the knock I think that's very striking but there's one thing sir you've forgotten your picture no matter how much he would knock you haven't got any latch for him to pull and be able to open the door and go in the artist said oh I painted it just like this for a purpose you see he's knocking at the door of a heart and the latch is always on the inside amen only you can open to him and he cannot but you have to open the door that's true you're the only one that can open up your heart's door Jesus may knock service after service after service but you have to be the one to respond come on somebody we can hear we can hear beautiful service and say wow that was such a picture of Christ he was standing there I've seen him in his suffering I've seen him there as he was knocking on the door and I I seen him there calling out for lost souls I'm sitting there calling out for needs and I've seen him doing these things but listen the picture also has you in it come on somebody it ain't just a preacher up here on the platform amen that is thou that is yielding his gift to God it is actually you that are moving the gift that's on the inside of him come on somebody it is you that is operating the gift that is on side of it Amen brother Brandon I'll get to it brother random talks about his own gift he said this is not me this is not what I can do he said this ain't even gone this is you operating the gift come on somebody is there somebody here ready to operate a gift of God and say God I have a need and I want you to come by my way and I want you to speak to my heart I want you to touch my life I want to be moved by you amen not just on the Physical Realm but on the inside that I can recognize he's here and I'm going to open the door he's here and I'm going to invite him in to come in and sup with me amen we get the picture all wrong we think he's the only one in the picture no out of the preacher's the only one in the picture or this one's the only one no we're all in this picture amen amen so I want to get to I'm gonna go through a lot of these so bear with me he said there's a lady sitting right out here can't you see that light over that woman she's got gallbladder trouble she's going to miss it God help Miss small do you believe God will heal you of gallbladder trouble then stand on your feet come on now then stand on your feet you had more faith than you thought you had I did not know the woman that's God's grace there he said if we're strangers wave your hand I don't know you but what he told you is the truth raise your hand now if you have faith and go home you will be well I don't know what was it amen she was about to miss it even though her trouble was being called out amen might have been a lot more people in there that had gallblood or gallbladder problems chances are it's the way it is amen might be more than one person in this room it has a certain issue or a certain problem I know we don't all face the same thing but we all we it can be one or two half and it would be called out and she's probably thinking well that's just so and so or that may be somebody else but God was not willing for her to miss it um God was not willing for her to miss it so therefore he would gave her name and he called her by name Oh Glory to God he knows your name he knows your address he knows where you're at and he said now I need a response if you hear what I've said and you believe what I said stand up so I see a woman weeping wiping tears from her eyes she'll believe me as God's Prophet she's sitting right here in front of me God Will Make Her well I don't know you never seen you but you're not from here you're from Grants Pass if you're believing from all with all your heart you'll be healed now you think that would be enough then told her where she's from so now we'd have narrowed it right down you know anyway we could say you know you're from Men in Louisiana well how narrow would it get that how many is from ending there's a bunch of us from in there amen but what if it come right down and said you're from 187. Joel 3 8. well that narrows it on down name but about three people now live at that address but then three people you could still be missing it but then he goes and he said hey she's going to miss it God don't let her miss it Miss Krueger I challenge you to believe have faith I don't know that woman I've never seen her in my life but God knows her there's no way in the world for me to know her she's just a warming sin in there if we're strangers raise up your hand whatever he told you is true Hallelujah that's confidence right there whatever he said is true whatever he does and whatever he has said and is spoken it is the truth hallelujah there's a lady sitting right back there way in the back she's got some kind of skin disease on her hands she don't even know what it is the doctors don't even know what it is she's had it for years and years oh she's going to miss it it sure is the world Miss Daniels there you are Ida McDaniels believe with all your heart I don't know the woman never seen her but there's a light over her God will go through all kinds of things to make sure you don't miss it he wants to know when you get down on the other end he can tell you with all of his heart I've done everything that you look so you wouldn't miss it so can't you see that light over that woman look real close Can't You See It She's suffering with an arthritis you believe with all your heart you can be healed of arthritis Miss trap if you believe it oh she's going to miss it done called her by her name she's going to miss it I never seen that woman amen I've never seen fixing it's fixing it was fixing to leave you lady that's the reason I had to call your name don't get strange at that oh yeah I can't believe he called me out all he was trying to do was heal you I can't believe the preacher said that all God was trying to do was to cut that out of your life don't get strange at that if I mean God knew her name don't get strange at that Jesus of Nazareth told Simon Peter who he was and who his father was he's the same Jesus tonight amen back to my left way back about middle ways back of the building as a woman praying she's fixing to die if God doesn't help her she has cancer it's cancer on her breasts oh God may she not miss it help me oh Lord sister if you believe oh God she's going to miss it Lord Jesus help me we pray Mary May there you are are we strangers of one another I don't know you you don't know me what was the conditions what was ever but what I don't even know what the conditions was but whatever was said was it true then believe it'll be over with oh God here's a lady sitting right back here eyes crossed praying She's suffering with rectal trouble in his hemorrhoids She's suffering with heart trouble okay eyes closed he said sir eyes closed praying so he's identified one characteristic She's suffering with a rectal trouble that's two it's hemorrhoids three She's suffering with heart trouble four she's going to miss it well I'll tell you what if I was back then I wouldn't got to come and speak got to come and speak well that's just brother so and so that's just so just so listen it's God's listen I can read the quote to you I've preached from it he said God always answers he said many times in the unexpected time in an unexpected place in an unexpected way very unexpected sometimes the way God will speak but the point is the way you're gonna where you're gonna ever gonna get anything from that voice speaking is to recognize it's God then if it's gone I have a responsibility to myself to remain alert and watch it and see what he's doing Among Us she's going to miss afternoon named about four things about her she's going to miss it God help us miss Willingham believe on the Lord Jesus there you are now

Oh Glory to God hallelujah Satan thought he's going to get by with that but he missed it God came on the scene oh God I love having Services where Satan missed it he tried to stop it he tried to hurt it he tried to hinder it he tried to push it down but he missed it he took a direct shot but he missed it amen he missed amen what is it Satan's trying to destroy your life Satan trying to bring you down but there's a voice and a speaker saying arise wake up got a speaker God is touching God is moving [Applause] he said has anybody ever seen that light you've seen a picture of it don't you see it now look right there look that light Emerald color standing right there don't you see it moving now it's over a Woman She's suffering with diabetes she has prayed she believes God oh God don't let it leave her she's going to miss it Miss Davis believe with all your heart there you are I've never seen the woman in my life here's my hands before God is that true wave your hands like that if that's true see now who did she touch not me she was 20 yards from me but she touched the high priest Jesus Christ just have faith and don't doubt and you can touch him because he's still the discerner he's still the discerner you want something from God then you start pulling on the gift of God saying God I have a need tonight I have something that I once spoke I have something that I I need to know I I have a certain situation amen just a few services that go hope it's all right sister Landon she was dealing with something and and she was just thinking about the story of Joseph I remember correctly and you know and and and and about the details and things and it wasn't even my notes and here I come and I go right down the same path speak the same words and the same thoughts in the same story go down to the details of it why because she had a need he's that kind of God and by her faith pulled that from the gift the gift is still in the body is still manifesting itself it's still touching Hearts it's still Discerning Hearts it's still ministering to needs it's still doing all of that it ain't the man it's the gift he said well I can't have confidence in the man well have confidence in the gift of God brother random said if you can't respect the man respect the gift oh I know we're so good to discern things and discern situations and we're you know everybody's a saw we can see him as a saw but you know the point of that story is not seeing everybody a Saul you make sure that you're seen as a David make sure the discernment is working in your life and you're not seen as the man who later killed Saul and then he died for what he'd done right come on now but be seen as a David you want to see everybody is so fine make sure you're as a David and say I'll not touch the Lord's anointing I have respect for the house of God I'll respect for the gift of God but you know how it is we we get we get all in our heart about somebody and the Bible says to go to that person so instead of going to that person we go to everybody else and you know what happens everybody else goes to that person you know what happens everybody else not not trying to be out of meanness not

that God's healed you you just go Tell The World God said because you're it's done see time doesn't matter to God it matters to us we see certain ages you know my goodness closer I'm getting to 50 the more I want to put on the brakes and ain't no brakes and now there ain't nothing that times the enemy it's a robber my wife sent a video to our family chat today of my little Katie dancing around as a little girl about Brook's age and doing Adriana dressed her up you know that was Adriana's live baby doll to dress her up and she was dancing doing this ballerina and it was all cute but to me makes you real melancholy to look back and see now she's not that little girl no more she's growing up getting her license God help us all it's a crazy time to be living in and you see yourself times moving on it's being robbed if you talk about something long enough you forget why you're talking about it it's the truth our minds ain't as sharp as they were and our bodies you know somebody says our minds try to cast checks our bodies can't cash our rights checks our bodies can't cash and it's the truth because in your mind sometimes you still think you're a young man and you want to jump off of this or do what you used to you can you can't do it no more it ain't there no more and I know you young strapping fellas like hi look at me I can dunk a ball I can do that just wait a few years like I said I don't know why I'm even going down this road but we're going we're having a good time just wait a few years next thing you'll know you'll get a little wife and you'll get some children you think oh they're so cute and next thing you know they don't grow it up and married and run away I what happened we find ourselves in these times we find ourselves in places that we don't like we find ourselves in situations we can't handle we find ourselves in moments that we can't do nothing about we got to have somebody who does and who can and who will amen so why would we try to limit God by limiting him in the way that he would speak and how he would want to anoint a minister and put a thought on his heart that may sometimes it may burn the hide off of you sometimes it may be nothing but a bunch of good butter and Salve and feel so good and the next time you feel like you got whoop one of them siding down the other but it's all for your good and if you'll take it as God speaking to you and God touching you and God concerned about you and God knowing who you are what you're going through and why you're in this situation how to get out of that situation and what you need to do if you need to repent repent if you need to do this do if you need to make it right make it right he knows all of our details he said I've never seen that woman or heard of her in my life Jehovah knows that to be true foreign lady sitting here She's suffering with complications one thing you got trouble in your eyes you're wearing glasses but your eyes are going bad you have arthritis if that's right wave your hand you have pains in your chest that white Rave right wave your hand you have stomach trouble is that right wave your hand do you believe that he will make you well do you believe God can tell me who you are Edna Gerald if you believe with all your heart believe it you can have your healing right now here's a lady sitting out here She's suffering with poor circulation in her body and she'll believe God will heal her if she believes it oh I believe she's going to miss it sure is anything have mercy is my prayer I can faintly see the Miss Riley do you believe that God can heal that poor circulation if you will receive it amen believe it God is good isn't he Stella Mercy yeah that's right I've never seen the woman in my life but God is rich in Mercy he don't want you to miss it you say my brother Timmy I'm afraid I'm going to miss the Rapture God don't want you to miss it so he's going to do everything he's got to do to call your name to speak to your heart Amen to say go do what you got to do to make right he don't want you to miss it there's a man sitting here who said whoa I thought man I'm gonna think women just the only ones missed it no a lot more of them than men maybe they had more faith to be called I don't know there's a man sitting right here I want you to turn your eyes I want you to turn your eyes can't you see that light hanging there there's a man sitting there looking at me praying he's suffering with lung trouble and weakness so he's looking right at him don't miss it sir Mr Carr rise up right now and accept your healing Jesus Christ has made you well I've never seen you in my life but God had I get amazed I get amazed at just how sermons work to be honest with you you preach a sermon you know it's more than just for one moment some of them I've only preached one time many of them but there's some that you know that's for other places and you don't know maybe where or maybe sometimes God would drop it in your heart that you're going to preach at a certain place and then you'll go there and that's what you'll speak it's amazing how God does certain things and how it says Ruth likes to tell this we I'd preached here at home and me and my father and family all went out to brother Jeremy Shriners and and I went to preach the first service I believe it was there one of the services there anyway and I opened my scripture and read my title and Adriana you know it was it Adriana sat there and she went through a notebook and she seen just right here a few services or maybe the last service here I'd preached it so she's oh he's already done it I don't need to take notes boom foreign it's amazing how God can so tailor a sermon and then use the same thought and tailor it all over again to go another Direction what is it it's different needs it's different people that's been praying they've been seeking after God and they've been asking for a certain thing to be done or said or a certain part to be ministered to and God has tailored that service right to that moment and no doubt it to touch that need and touch many other needs and then you take that same sermon and you go hundreds of miles or even a thousand miles or across the world and go somewhere else and you preach it and you watch and I get amazed even the minister I'm looking at my notes but I see where it's being directed I see the the the the the light as it were of the anointing of God pulling me a different direction go down a whole different Channel and and hit on certain things that I didn't get to hit here or touch certain things that I did or if I touch the same thing they touch it in a different way what is it it is the discerner and he is to be tailoring it to who is sitting on the pew and who's been crying out to God and saying God I have a knee and I want you to be me this time I want it to be on this Wednesday night it's my turn and you know what he will design a whole service to come down and speak to you and call you out and say it's your turn it's your moment it's your time you and this is your visitation that wasn't he says a man very fine man sitting right there praying too what's the matter with that man that man has eye trouble he has a growth on his left side his name is Mr Bartlett you believe am I a stranger to you wave your hand we're all strangers that's right God bless you believe you'll be healed you believe he said here is a lady sitting right here looking right at me right down the aisle She's suffering with a heart trouble I hope she don't miss it God tell me who she is she's Mrs Fitzgerald you believe that with all your heart you can have your healing raise your hand it's I'm a stranger to you is that right your heart trouble is gone it's that is that your name that's right I didn't know you never seen you in my life lady right behind you she's got faith now she's got faith now she's got a prayer card in her hand but the lady is suffering and being it is it's the holy spirit that light hanging right over her she's got a tumor in her neck she's also got a fallen stomach is that right do you believe right now hey have faith in God you have that prayer card lay it on the floor you don't need it no more hallelujah hallelujah why was it it was faith and a gift faith in the promised word that God could bring it to pass see that devil he thought he would miss it then talking about this man there's a man sitting right over there he's got a tumor the tumors in his back I don't know the man I've never seen him he's a total stranger to me but when I sing that devil go out there that black shadow and I've seen it right over this way and it went to this one for Mercy they're trying to congregate around here Satan thought he would miss that or thought I would miss it but the Lord showed it to me foreign never expected to get dessert thought he was sneaking around going to cause a disturbance and a service ah no no the Lord knows where he's at he knows he's trying to get people to disbelieve so what would happen this he said you see that dark line going from that one to the other he said is that that trouble that cancer calling out to that cancer saying help I need help help me make them disbelieve come on somebody so you wonder why sometimes those weird feelings come over you in the moment right before your breakthrough because that spirit is trying to call call out to other Spirits amen listen I know Spirits no spirits I watched it too many times in a youth camp kids that don't know each other from The Man in the Moon can get off one bus and off of another vehicle from two different parts of the country in just a few moments they're best friends why because of the spirits that are upon them you look at them they dress alike they talk alike they're saying they have the same disinterest and service they have the same disinterest in being there matter of fact both of them probably didn't want to be there probably both of their mamas made them come and here they get off of one bus from another place and a band from another and they meet at a camp right in Louisiana Spirits are coming together why do you think in these Services the devil is trying to keep us pushed down he feels a little faith beginning to rise and he starts all in a help help they're starting to believe I need reinforcements help they're starting to get free help oh God oh if we could see in that other realm you may have been calling by for help but what was it it was that Spirit on the inside of you that was said help I need help I need help I need help and his voice did nothing but get the attention of God himself and he said there's that dark line going over there and it's going over there trying to congel together but right now there's one greater in the room Hallelujah that's one greater in our midst he said right over here is this man to this woman to my left over here there's there's this woman she's scared she's afraid she's got cancer she don't even know yet but she's afraid she's got it there's so much fear being pulled around in that room by those spirits she's very much shook up about it I hope she don't miss it the woman has tried for a long time to press her way in but she's afraid she isn't from here she comes from another city in the city that's smaller than this one that we're in this though it lays South from here it's side of a mountain it's Tucson that lady's name is Miss Buck you believe we accept your healing all right don't be scared of it no more your faith has made you whole oh God a little later with female trouble God bless you you believe with all your heart I'm afraid you're not catching it you're missing it I see it come to you and you didn't respond to its call how many times is our healings or victories been delayed because we didn't respond when he came to us say ah brother Brown testified it brother Matt I believe it was just tell him about it said he would he would have gave his heart to the Lord a long time before he said but there was a spirit that hung over him saying wait a little longer next service he'll he'll put a next service before a young person all the way to hell he'll put a next service before somebody that's needing a very a real victory in her life all the way till that thing takes them down into the grave he said you're missing it I see it come to you but you won't respond to it you didn't respond to it as soon as you do he says because that faith has to catch and you're getting your mind you're wondering if it's someone else and it's you listen to discernment here you're wondering if that's to somebody else and it's to you so it was coming to her and as soon as it would get close in her mind she'd say well I feel that but is that for somebody else and she wouldn't respond to it and it would move away you're wondering if it's for somebody else but it's you God don't let us put our blessing off to another service don't let us miss our moments our opportunities and God wanted to touch us ah that's somebody else here's a woman sitting right here she's kind of a middle-aged woman kind of Gray she's praying for a friend of hers the friend has a bad cold that's
