[34:43] in these last few moments of time amen
[34:46] Hebrews chap 11 and verse
[34:49] one and also Luke 1 and verse 26 it says
[34:53] now Faith is the substance of things
[34:56] hoped for the the evidence of Things Not
[34:58] Seen for by it the elders obtained a
[35:01] good report through through faith we
[35:04] understand that the worlds were framed
[35:07] by the word of God so the things which
[35:09] are seen were not made of things which
[35:12] do appear Luke 1 and verse 26 says in
[35:17] the sixth month the angel Gabriel was
[35:19] sent from God into the city of Galilee
[35:22] named Nazareth to a virgin spouse to a
[35:25] man whose name was Joseph of the House
[35:27] of David and the virgin's name was Mary
[35:31] and angel and the angel came into her
[35:33] and said hail Thou Art highly favored
[35:36] the Lord is with thee blessed art thou
[35:39] among women and when she saw him she was
[35:41] troubled at his saying and cast in her
[35:44] mind what manner of salutation this must
[35:47] be and the angel said unto her fear not
[35:50] Mary for thou has found favor with God
[35:54] and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy
[35:55] womb and bring forth the son and shall
[35:58] call his name Jesus and he shall be
[36:01] great and shall be called the son of the
[36:03] highest and the Lord God shall give unto
[36:06] him the Throne of his father David and
[36:08] he shall reign over the house of Jacob
[36:10] forever and of his kingdom there shall
[36:12] be no end then said Mary unto the angel
[36:15] how shall this be seeing I know not a
[36:17] man and the angel answered and said unto
[36:20] her the Holy Ghost shall come unto thee
[36:23] and the power of the highest shall
[36:24] overshadow thee therefore also that Holy
[36:27] thing which shall be born of thee shall
[36:29] be called The Son of God and behold thy
[36:31] cousin Elizabeth she has also conceived
[36:34] a son and her old age and this is the
[36:36] sixth Monon with her who ALS was also
[36:39] called baren for with God nothing shall
[36:42] be impossible and Mary said behold the
[36:46] handmade of the Lord be it unto me
[36:48] according to Thy word and the angel
[36:51] departed from her amen we'll let you be
[36:55] seated
[36:59] I'd like to speak to you this evening on
[37:01] a thought on it is the season for
[37:04] Faith amen it's not that Faith goes in
[37:07] and out of season but it is the time to
[37:10] believe amen and I I believe if there
[37:13] ever was a time upon the face of this
[37:15] Earth to believe right now is the time
[37:17] to believe you know I was looking at
[37:20] something brother Rand said about a
[37:21] doctor he visited he said this doctor
[37:24] said I studied to be a minister I
[37:26] studied St for four years and I became
[37:29] an agnostic that's kind of interesting
[37:31] ain't it study to be a minister and
[37:33] become an agnostic I just threw it all
[37:35] up and I said there's nothing to any of
[37:37] it he said I studied Muhammad and they
[37:40] had virgin births I studied Buddha and
[37:42] they had virgin birst then here's the
[37:44] Bible and I said just a minute doctor I
[37:46] said you're trying to compare error with
[37:49] truth that's right I said one of them is
[37:51] ridiculous and the other is Sublime
[37:54] that's right they can't prove one thing
[37:56] mamad can't prove it he said I visited
[37:58] the grave of most all of those Founders
[38:00] but where where is Jesus buried today I
[38:03] said he rose again said how do you know
[38:06] that they didn't just steal him away I
[38:08] said he rose again how do you know he
[38:10] liveth now where in my heart that's
[38:13] right I said the trouble of it is doctor
[38:15] in the Garden of Eden there was two
[38:17] trees one was knowledge and one was
[38:19] Faith one was life amen and one was the
[38:23] death of one was death of knowledge and
[38:25] the other was the life by faith and as
[38:27] long as they eat by faith of this tree
[38:30] all right they lived but when they got
[38:32] on this tree on this other tree of
[38:34] knowledge he died the first bite he took
[38:36] he separated himself from God and man
[38:39] continually has been biting off that
[38:42] tree and every time he takes a bite by
[38:44] knowledge he destroys himself God
[38:46] destroys nothing but man destroys
[38:49] himself through knowledge he says look
[38:51] he bit himself off some Gunpowder and he
[38:53] kills he bit himself off of the that
[38:56] tree an automobile and has killed more
[38:58] than all the wars put together knowledge
[39:01] by eating off of that tree he's gotten
[39:04] himself a hydrogen bomb and nuclear
[39:06] bombs now and I wonder what he's going
[39:08] to do with that see but the trouble of
[39:10] it is these people they figure up so
[39:12] much on this tree of knowledge that when
[39:14] they can't figure it out any longer they
[39:17] just say Bosch with all of it how many
[39:19] knows what that means I never heard that
[39:21] saying before BOS actually means all of
[39:24] this is nonsense or foolish talk so if
[39:26] they can't figure it out any longer they
[39:29] say it's just all nonsense he said
[39:31] listen in the name of the Lord listen I
[39:34] mean thinks we ought to listen right
[39:35] there when you can't figure it out
[39:38] anymore that is the time to
[39:41] believe amen when you can't figure it
[39:43] out anymore that is the time to believe
[39:46] it's like someone going to swim and as
[39:49] long as you got your feet on the ground
[39:51] all right you can jump around you can
[39:53] Splash but it's when you step off in the
[39:56] Deep then it's time to swim it's where
[39:59] you can't figure it out that's when you
[40:01] have to believe from there on Amen
[40:04] figure out as much as you can but when
[40:06] you can't figure out anymore then from
[40:08] right there start believing and believe
[40:11] only you say well I went to the doctor
[40:13] and the doctor says I got a tumor and he
[40:15] said he says he can't do anything for me
[40:17] and it's done went all the way through
[40:19] me it's malignant I can't do nothing for
[40:21] you you go to another doctor he can't do
[40:24] nothing before you it's done then from
[40:26] right there start
[40:28] believing start believing believe right
[40:31] there and say Lord Jesus they can't do
[40:34] nothing but I'm coming to you and then
[40:36] God will move on the
[40:39] scene see faith faith is something that
[40:42] you have to believe it's there when
[40:45] nothing else will declare it's there but
[40:48] Faith amen many times your senses will
[40:51] not declare it's there it would not
[40:53] declare healing is there or Deliverance
[40:55] is there or salvation is there but Faith
[40:58] amen is something that you can take that
[41:00] can declare it even though you can't see
[41:02] it with your eyes you can't feel it with
[41:04] your feelings you can't you can't look
[41:06] around and see it or or know it's there
[41:08] by any of your senses but by faith you
[41:11] say it is there because I have something
[41:14] to believe and what do we believe we
[41:15] don't believe man's ideas our faith is
[41:18] not on man's ideas or man's Creeds or
[41:20] man Dogma our faith is upon the word of
[41:23] God Amen that's where true faith lies
[41:26] now amen you can have faith in a tree
[41:28] but that tree can die you can have faith
[41:30] in whatever you can have faith in your
[41:32] car and get in it today and go down the
[41:33] road and it kill on you right there
[41:35] before you get to mending there you can
[41:37] have faith in a lot of things that can
[41:39] that can fall away but there's something
[41:41] that you can have faith with faith in
[41:43] that'll never fall away or never not
[41:46] come to pass or never fail but it'll be
[41:49] steady and a firm foundation that no
[41:51] matter what you see or what you feel or
[41:53] what you don't see or what you don't
[41:55] feel you can still believe anyhow
[41:57] because what God's word declared it and
[42:00] is there even though we can't declare it
[42:02] in our senses but we can declare it by
[42:05] faith because we know his word will not
[42:07] fail amen it will fulfill that what is
[42:10] sent to do amen he that in the Bible you
[42:13] know said know it says he that cometh to
[42:15] God must believe that he is and it is
[42:18] impossible to please God without faith
[42:21] and you can't please him if he don't
[42:23] have faith see God allows you many times
[42:25] to come come down to the end of the Rope
[42:27] when you can't figure it out no more to
[42:29] see what you're going to do there he
[42:31] allows you to come to those places in
[42:33] your life that the doctor can't help you
[42:35] or your your finances can't help you no
[42:37] more or this that and the other can't do
[42:39] nothing for you you can't do nothing for
[42:41] yourself it's all it's all done as far
[42:43] as humanly declarations can say but God
[42:46] brings you to those places so you he
[42:49] wants to see how you are going to go
[42:51] from there if you're going to step off
[42:53] the tree of knowledge and step on to the
[42:55] tree of of life amen I believe there's a
[42:58] people that's living on that tree of
[43:00] life they're living on the Lord Jesus
[43:02] Christ and his word and what he has
[43:04] spoken this hour amen we're not living
[43:06] we're not believing amen the words of a
[43:09] just the words of a seventh grade KY and
[43:11] it goes beyond that amen has been
[43:13] Vindicated from on high amen God himself
[43:17] came down and said amen to the words
[43:19] that we believe therefore we can stand
[43:21] upon the word no matter what is going on
[43:24] around us amen many of you people people
[43:26] have faith you know brother B said it
[43:27] this way in your doctors and he said you
[43:29] should have if you got a doctor he said
[43:31] now if something gets wrong with you you
[43:33] go to that Old Faithful doctor you
[43:35] believe in that's what you should do
[43:37] that's good and you submit your case to
[43:39] him and but if he says you should go to
[43:41] the hospital you don't do a thing but
[43:44] you you maybe go home and pack a few
[43:46] clothes and go to the hospital you don't
[43:48] necessarily argue with him if you
[43:50] believe him if you got faith in that
[43:52] doctor he said if he doesn't decide what
[43:54] you to go to the hospital but he would
[43:56] thinks you just need a prescription and
[43:58] he gives you a sack full of pills and
[44:00] you'll swallow them and you don't even
[44:02] know what those pills are going to do
[44:04] many times but you got faith in that
[44:06] doctor he said how about
[44:09] God how about God if you're scared to
[44:13] swallow some of the gospels amen that he
[44:16] gives you by his stripes you are healed
[44:19] faith is the victory that overcomes the
[44:21] world swallow it and see what happens
[44:25] amen follow it and see what kind of
[44:27] effect amen it'll have an effect in your
[44:29] life see it's a confidence you show what
[44:32] confidence you have in your doctor by
[44:34] taking the medicine he
[44:37] subscribes now I know we got a lot of
[44:39] knowi it alls amen who knows more than
[44:41] the doctor and they'll go to a doctor
[44:42] and say well he don't even know what
[44:43] he's talking about why you go to the
[44:45] doctor to begin
[44:47] with amen you go there to try to get
[44:50] help you don't go there to find out if
[44:52] he's stupider than you are you go there
[44:54] to find out if he knows more than you
[44:57] know amen if he knows amen what that
[45:00] symptom May indicate or what what that
[45:03] that look may be or what that feel may
[45:05] be amen he's studied he's he's given
[45:07] himself so you go there to because you
[45:09] should have faith amen it takes Faith to
[45:12] go to a
[45:14] doctor yeah it does it takes Faith to go
[45:17] and it sure takes Faith to take what he
[45:19] gives you because with what it gives you
[45:22] has side effects and there's there's the
[45:24] things that it does to your body that
[45:26] you have to do the good and you get the
[45:27] evil with it it's the tree of knowledge
[45:29] of Good and Evil so there's good with it
[45:31] and there's evil with it there's there's
[45:33] the good that it does and there's evil
[45:35] that it does but you you take it because
[45:37] you have faith in what he said but how
[45:40] much more should we have faith in what
[45:42] God said because God does not have no
[45:45] evil side effects his word does not have
[45:48] one evil side effect or one bad effect
[45:51] in your life matter of fact it's nothing
[45:53] but good if you'll swallow the word of
[45:56] God and let it go into your body into
[45:58] the spiritual man and begin begin to
[46:00] ruminate on that and allow it to affect
[46:03] your life it only has good
[46:06] effects it's not good and evil it's only
[46:09] good amen swallow it and see what
[46:12] happened see it's a confidence you show
[46:14] what confidence you have in your doctor
[46:16] by taking his medicine that's that you
[46:18] don't know what it is you show your
[46:20] confidence in the doctor by submitting
[46:22] yourself to an operation that proves
[46:24] your confidence in the doctor but when
[46:26] it comes to Christ many times we're
[46:28] scared to take him at his
[46:32] word come on now and and and this doctor
[46:36] Jesus ain't lost one
[46:39] case Hey listen you can go to a doctor
[46:42] and I I believe in doctors and I'm
[46:43] thankful for doctors I I'm thankful that
[46:46] God's given them the wisdom that he's
[46:47] given them this day honestly I wouldn't
[46:49] have wanted to go to a doctor 100 years
[46:51] ago or 150 years ago and they thought
[46:54] they had to bleed you to death or bleed
[46:55] you know what all the the stuff they
[46:57] they had tried to I'm glad they've
[46:59] learned to where they're at right
[47:01] now amen quite quite amazing what they
[47:04] can do in the time that we live in but
[47:06] there's a point that your doctor can
[47:07] only take you so far amen amen but see
[47:12] when it comes an operation there's many
[47:14] of them that have made the wrong moves
[47:15] there's many of them that's has done
[47:17] things and many of them malpractice and
[47:20] and done things on purpose and killed
[47:22] people come on now there there's many of
[47:26] them though that in their own wisdom and
[47:28] knowledge they tried to do their best
[47:30] they can and they and they and they
[47:31] slipped or in surgery or something
[47:33] happened and they lost patients or or
[47:35] the surgery didn't do no good but this
[47:37] doctor Jesus has not lost one patient he
[47:42] has not misjudged one case he is not
[47:45] misdiagnosed one case he he knows
[47:48] exactly what is going on in your life
[47:50] and he knows exactly what it will take
[47:53] to to heal that in your life he knows
[47:55] exactly but when the healing or the pill
[47:57] Comes The Gospel comes it's up to you to
[48:00] take it that's right amen it's up to you
[48:03] to believe that's not just Timothy PR or
[48:05] Tim PR or Joe Adams or Aaron Oglesby or
[48:08] whoever stand by in this pull pit that
[48:10] is a gospel that is being given to me
[48:13] and if I'll take it in my life it'll
[48:15] heal me of my disease it'll heal me of
[48:18] what I'm going
[48:19] through
[48:22] amen we've said it many times before and
[48:25] brother Tim's Used this analogy before
[48:27] but it's worth repeating with
[48:31] animals brother Tim was one of the best
[48:34] I've ever seen that diagnosing goats you
[48:36] know you could pull their eyelids back
[48:38] and they'd be pale and it's got worms
[48:41] Timothy go pull up so much MLS of sidon
[48:45] and give this and go get get pull this
[48:47] shot up and do this and so I'd go do it
[48:50] you know I'd go grab that goat chase
[48:52] that goat down or find it on the stand
[48:54] somewhere and grab a hold of his neck
[48:55] and pull it around open his mouth and
[48:57] push that right down that goat didn't
[48:59] have one choice whatsoever it was going
[49:02] to take that
[49:04] medicine because I had decided and
[49:07] brother Tim had decided this is what it
[49:08] needed this is what the problem is this
[49:10] is what it's got to have and so you grab
[49:12] a hold of the goat and you just put it
[49:14] right down its old throat and you just
[49:16] push it in or you pull a shot put it in
[49:18] this muscle or but under the skin
[49:20] however is however is to be given and it
[49:22] didn't have you could it couldn't say I
[49:24] I don't want that today I I don't feel
[49:26] like that's what I need I I want I want
[49:28] a second opinion there was no second
[49:31] opinions you know it was I was the only
[49:33] opinion that that was only that they
[49:35] couldn't say
[49:36] no but that's the difference between you
[49:39] and a
[49:41] goat you can hear the gospel and you can
[49:44] say well I want a second opinion I I
[49:46] just don't know if that'll do what I
[49:48] need I I just don't know if that's what
[49:50] what's important for me right now and if
[49:52] you're not careful you allow what can
[49:54] heal you go right by you what can
[49:57] deliver you if you're not take it cuz us
[49:59] as ministers we we can lay it out there
[50:02] we can put it before you but we cannot
[50:04] grab you by the neck open your mouth and
[50:06] shove it down your throat it don't work
[50:09] that way it's by
[50:10] faith amen by believing that is the
[50:13] truth and therefore I'm going to accept
[50:15] it as the truth for my situation and I
[50:17] know God a move for
[50:22] me he said if you could submit your case
[50:25] to Jesus Christ tonight just as you
[50:28] submit your case to the
[50:30] doctor come on now give me anything you
[50:34] want
[50:35] Lord amen come on
[50:37] now listen if you're sick enough you go
[50:40] to the doctor you say give me anything
[50:41] you
[50:42] got amen you know most people don't
[50:45] believe in doctors ain't never been
[50:49] sick come on I I I've heard it preached
[50:51] even in message circles around overseas
[50:54] especially especially in China about
[50:57] that you know if you you went to a
[50:58] doctor that mean you didn't have faith
[51:00] and and they preached that until they
[51:02] got sick and they needed to go to the
[51:04] doctor then they realized they needed a
[51:06] doctor and so all of a sudden it ain't
[51:08] the same anymore but I I believe they
[51:10] ought to live by what they
[51:13] preach amen there was people that lost
[51:15] children lost little babies and things
[51:18] because they wouldn't take them to the
[51:19] doctor because of what this man preached
[51:21] but when this man got in that situation
[51:23] he got sick enough he went to the doctor
[51:26] he ought to live by what he preached
[51:28] amen but listen you have to submit give
[51:31] me anything you want to
[51:33] Lord and listen that's the way we ought
[51:35] to come that's what real faith is
[51:37] whatever it is if it's if I need to
[51:39] Humble let it be a humble pill if I need
[51:42] to bow down and and worship you give me
[51:44] one of those pills if I need to ask for
[51:46] forgiveness give me that pill Lord
[51:48] whatever it is I want to take
[51:51] it I need
[51:54] help you're the doctor on the case then
[51:57] you can have Victory then you got faith
[51:59] that overcomes he said you'll never hunt
[52:02] another prayer line You'll never hunt
[52:03] nothing else you'll have it right there
[52:05] it'll be settled you'll never jump from
[52:07] church to church to see if this one's
[52:09] got it that one's got it they they
[52:11] haven't got it you got it then when you
[52:13] got the faith you got the victory he
[52:15] said I tell you what we need today in
[52:17] America and what we need to do in this
[52:19] Tabernacle is to let Dr Jesus come in
[52:23] and perform an operation on our
[52:26] Faith amen perform an operation on our
[52:29] faith the doctor tells you you got a
[52:31] little appendix it's all poison it ought
[52:33] to come out you got this or you got
[52:35] something else wrong it's got to come
[52:36] out what he takes out out so the rest of
[52:39] you can function right that's what's a
[52:41] matter with our fa Faith we're afraid to
[52:43] let God take his operating word his
[52:46] knife sharper than any two-edged sword
[52:49] and operate us and tell us that our
[52:51] little Fandango and our huming around is
[52:54] wrong and we got to turn loose of every
[52:56] shadow and sail towards God's Eternal
[52:58] promises hard as we go Jesus will
[53:01] perform an operation of our faith he'll
[53:03] take away all doubt he'll take away all
[53:05] fear he'll take away all worry he'll
[53:08] take everything out of there that's not
[53:10] supposed to be
[53:13] there when our faith is clearly operated
[53:16] on we will come out a new creature
[53:19] different can you trust Jesus for an
[53:24] operation
[53:26] excuse me can you trust Jesus for an
[53:32] operation can you trust him and believe
[53:34] in him and can you say Lord God at Thy
[53:39] word it's a gospel at Thy word you know
[53:43] as disciples in St Mark 5 they said we
[53:46] saned all night have taken nothing
[53:48] nevertheless Lord at Thy word I will let
[53:51] down the
[53:53] net amen they believe what he said Lord
[53:57] I'm I'm a fisherman I know this you know
[53:59] Peter Peter maybe said I know the signs
[54:01] of moon everything I know they're
[54:03] they're biting when they're not I know
[54:05] when they're in schools when they're not
[54:07] I I I've saned all night and here in the
[54:10] C Council of doctors here with me Dr
[54:12] fisherman we know our trade we searched
[54:14] the stream all night we've taken nothing
[54:17] but at Thy word I'll let down the net
[54:19] because the chief surgeon said so the
[54:22] chief doctor said to do it and then they
[54:25] was enclosed with such a multitude of
[54:27] fish until their Nets begin to break why
[54:30] faith is a victory there might not have
[54:32] been in one fish in that water but when
[54:35] God said it he'll create a fish
[54:38] there Hallelujah he'll put them there no
[54:42] matter what your senses
[54:45] declare come on somebody when he said by
[54:48] my stripes your heal amen he will put
[54:52] healing there no matter what your senses
[54:54] say
[54:55] if you'll take him at his word and say
[54:58] at TH word I'm putting down the net
[55:00] that's
[55:03] right said there may not be a chance
[55:05] you'll live you may be dying with cancer
[55:08] you may be bound to a wheelchair you may
[55:10] be totally blind I don't know what your
[55:12] trouble is but if you'll take Chief
[55:15] doctor's subscription whatsoever things
[55:17] you desire When you pray believe you
[55:20] receive it and you shall have it
[55:23] Hallelujah that's what's written on on
[55:25] the outside of your bottle amen
[55:27] whatsoever things you desire When you
[55:29] pray believe you receive it and you
[55:31] shall have it and believe that faith
[55:33] will overcome any difficult that is
[55:35] there you may be so burdened with sin
[55:37] until your soul as SMUD as can be you
[55:40] may have tried to get rid of that ill
[55:41] temper and that slandering tongue and
[55:43] that gospel gossip on the telephone you
[55:45] might have triy to ever remedy you know
[55:47] how but if you'll just let Jesus Christ
[55:49] coming tonight he will operate on your
[55:52] faith and give you a faith that'll climb
[55:54] Beyond anything the world could ever
[55:58] produce faith is the
[56:02] victory how could you doubt how could we
[56:06] doubt in the time that we're living in
[56:08] when we see the signs that are appearing
[56:10] all around us we see what's been written
[56:13] on here for thousands of years being
[56:15] fulfilled right here before our eyes we
[56:18] see visions that were given back in 1933
[56:21] that are being fulfilled right one right
[56:23] after another
[56:26] yes but see that's a problem with a lot
[56:28] of people they tried to figure it all
[56:30] out and when they got down to their
[56:31] figure and and they couldn't figure him
[56:33] no more instead of believing anyway they
[56:36] went into doubt and
[56:40] unbelief yeah and then it led into
[56:42] doubting what a prophet said and
[56:44] doubting he even visited about an angel
[56:46] doubting that an angel even knew what he
[56:48] was talking about doubting that there
[56:50] was anything happened down Through the
[56:52] Ages doubting that Jesus was even born
[56:55] doubting that even was a God or is a God
[56:59] Amen it goes it's a it's a bottomless
[57:01] pit but when Jesus Christ the son of the
[57:04] Living God his presence is moving Among
[57:07] Us his great holy spirit is in this
[57:09] building the word promise Lo I'm with
[57:11] you always even to the end of the world
[57:13] it was a promise by the
[57:17] doctor God has to keep his word he when
[57:20] he promised he would do these things God
[57:23] is solemnly obligated to do what he
[57:29] said so that's where our faith has to
[57:31] rest it cannot rest on anything else if
[57:34] your faith is resting on feelings so if
[57:36] your feelings is up your faith is up if
[57:39] your feelings is down your faith is down
[57:41] if it's resting upon your sight as long
[57:44] as you see good things and your faith is
[57:45] seeing good things and long or if you
[57:48] see the storm around you then that's all
[57:49] your faith can see but if your faith is
[57:52] resting on the word the word word stays
[57:55] in that position it doesn't go down it
[57:57] doesn't go up it stays solid amen and
[58:00] long as it's resting upon what he said
[58:03] that it doesn't matter if your feelings
[58:05] are up or down or your sights up or down
[58:08] or or your hearings up or down that
[58:10] matters not anymore amen because there's
[58:12] a faith that is resting upon the
[58:16] word but we see is that we read about
[58:21] Mary and we're in the season of this
[58:24] know of course we don't believe that
[58:26] Jesus was born at Christmas day it's
[58:28] just a day that had been set aside for
[58:30] his birth and we know how they
[58:32] commercialized it and all that not going
[58:34] to get into all that but we know that he
[58:36] was born as a lamb and no doubt in the
[58:39] springtime brother brandom held this all
[58:41] the way through his
[58:42] ministry and and he said as a spring sun
[58:46] was Rising into Judean
[58:49] skies and Mary started walking down the
[58:52] street with a little water pot in her
[58:54] arm
[58:56] and he said her little mind was thinking
[58:57] of the day before how they went to the
[59:00] synagogue and they' heard the priest the
[59:03] rabbi preach a
[59:04] sermon and how he talked of how he
[59:07] explained to the people how they got
[59:08] settled in the land and how they got
[59:10] there and what they all went through and
[59:13] the promises that God had made to their
[59:15] father Abraham hundreds of years before
[59:18] that they would inherit that land and
[59:20] how when God had made the promise he
[59:22] would not go back on one promise
[59:25] and that they had come through the Red
[59:27] Sea as a dry ground and how that before
[59:30] that that God had taken them out of the
[59:32] hands of the enemy and how God loves to
[59:34] take his children out of the hands of
[59:37] the
[59:38] enemy that sounds like a pretty good
[59:40] sermon so far he loves to take his
[59:42] children out of the hands of the enemy I
[59:45] I tell you what I I just wanted to shout
[59:46] when I heard that because I I see a lot
[59:48] of cancer that's got our got God's
[59:50] children and I believe God's going to
[59:52] take them out of the hands of the enemy
[59:55] I see a lot of diseases a lot of sin a
[59:57] lot of things has got God's children and
[59:59] he takes them out of the hand of the
[1:00:01] Enemy by great signs and wonders and and
[1:00:04] he fed them in the wilderness for 40
[1:00:06] years and what a great God they
[1:00:11] had but at the end of the message he
[1:00:13] runed everything he
[1:00:15] said because he said these great days of
[1:00:17] Jehovah dealing with people like that it
[1:00:20] isn't necessary no
[1:00:23] more we got the same rabbis in this day
[1:00:26] too and they get up and they say well
[1:00:29] this is not the season of
[1:00:32] Miracles rabbis in the message pull pit
[1:00:34] this is not the season of Miracles well
[1:00:36] let me tell you something what the
[1:00:38] prophet said he said if it's if the
[1:00:41] season of Miracles if it's not the
[1:00:42] season of Miracles then the if the if
[1:00:44] it's not the day of Miracles then it's
[1:00:46] not the day of
[1:00:48] God cuz God is a miracle so Miracles are
[1:00:52] always in season
[1:00:55] hallelujah amen healing is always in
[1:00:59] season amen deliverances is always in
[1:01:03] season because it's in God it's in his
[1:01:06] word and his word will not be
[1:01:09] unfulfilled it will not return unto him
[1:01:12] void but it will accomplish that what is
[1:01:14] sent to
[1:01:16] do so he said these great days of
[1:01:20] Jehovah dealing with people like that
[1:01:22] wasn't necessary no more become settled
[1:01:25] down in their Homeland they didn't
[1:01:27] exactly need Miracles no more they had
[1:01:29] good doctors for their sickness they're
[1:01:32] better off they had homes they didn't
[1:01:33] need God of Miracles anymore but somehow
[1:01:36] that didn't satisfy Joseph and Mary
[1:01:39] somehow something on the inside you know
[1:01:41] they' be to be engaged they were engaged
[1:01:44] to be married soon and and you know as a
[1:01:46] custom was after the service was over
[1:01:49] they would go to their home to the home
[1:01:50] there and she would come over and they
[1:01:52] would sit out on the porch there and
[1:01:54] would talk talk about things and they
[1:01:55] look across the hill where he was
[1:01:57] building a house for them and you know
[1:01:59] he was a carpenter and so he he would
[1:02:00] try to get all the doors to fit exactly
[1:02:03] right and the windows to fit exactly
[1:02:04] right cuz he was building a special
[1:02:06] place for his bride and the you know the
[1:02:09] windows had to be Plum and the door had
[1:02:10] to work operate operate right and all
[1:02:13] these things and they was talking about
[1:02:14] all the things and the colors and this
[1:02:16] that and the
[1:02:17] other then their thoughts started going
[1:02:19] towards what had been spoken oh yeah and
[1:02:23] he said Mary said you know since I heard
[1:02:25] that Rabbi say that that this great God
[1:02:28] has brought us here and made us who we
[1:02:30] are but he doesn't do things for us like
[1:02:33] he did
[1:02:35] then I've been thinking for a long time
[1:02:38] that if that that this God was as great
[1:02:41] in the days of our father as he was in
[1:02:43] the days of our grandfather why isn't he
[1:02:45] just the same great God
[1:02:48] today brother Rand said that's good
[1:02:51] thinking right there amen because if he
[1:02:54] was was God back then he's still the
[1:02:56] same today if he did Miracles back then
[1:03:00] he still does Miracles today if he
[1:03:02] healed back there he still heals
[1:03:05] today or he's not
[1:03:08] God and let's just fold it up and go
[1:03:11] home but he is
[1:03:14] God she goes back in the house she picks
[1:03:17] out a scroll and she comes back and it's
[1:03:20] Isaiah she opens it up and it just
[1:03:22] happens to follow on Isaiah
[1:03:24] 96 I love how he describes this scene
[1:03:28] I'm sorry maybe no I ain't sorry I
[1:03:30] believe you probably saw it all played
[1:03:34] out and he and he tells says we'll read
[1:03:37] some scriptures of just wherever God
[1:03:39] will lead us and she picked it up now
[1:03:42] and he turned it over the scroll and
[1:03:43] begin reading out of Isaiah 9:6 unto us
[1:03:47] a son is born unto us a child is given
[1:03:49] and she looks over there with her lovely
[1:03:51] soft eyes and said to her husband to be
[1:03:53] what do you think think the prophet was
[1:03:55] speaking of he said well Mary I I
[1:03:57] believe he was speaking of the Messiah
[1:03:59] that's to come and that's why we keep
[1:04:01] our bloodstream clean and we don't mix
[1:04:03] with other nations because someday God's
[1:04:05] going to send a messiah Among
[1:04:07] Us so the next morning as she's walking
[1:04:10] down the road she's thinking about these
[1:04:12] things and she's pondering upon them and
[1:04:16] and wondering how these things will all
[1:04:18] be and as as she's walking she begins to
[1:04:20] feel this warm feeling around
[1:04:23] her I felt that before myself feeling
[1:04:26] this warm feeling around her and you
[1:04:28] know it's usually when you're thinking
[1:04:30] about God and you're keeping them on
[1:04:32] your mind that's when God comes close to
[1:04:36] us amen I he said I think that's one of
[1:04:38] the Troubles of the people today we have
[1:04:41] too many other things in our mind even
[1:04:43] we come to a service we seem to think
[1:04:45] well if I don't get this or if I'm not
[1:04:46] prayed for if this don't it's don't we
[1:04:49] got to just let all of that go and start
[1:04:52] thinking about God
[1:04:57] God he's preaching to the angelist
[1:05:00] temple and he says this angelist Temple
[1:05:03] is thirsting for an outbreak of the Holy
[1:05:07] Spirit I wonder how many hands would go
[1:05:09] up and say I'm thirsting for that same
[1:05:11] thing I read that today I said I'm
[1:05:13] thirsting for that same thing an
[1:05:16] outbreak of the holy spirit amen he said
[1:05:19] I believe that God will let it
[1:05:23] happen he said let's just be positive in
[1:05:25] our thinking let's believe that this
[1:05:27] night a Revival would
[1:05:31] break come on somebody let's believe
[1:05:34] that this night God will do exceedingly
[1:05:37] above and beyond what we can think or he
[1:05:40] can do
[1:05:42] tonight don't take no for an
[1:05:46] answer come on now don't take no for an
[1:05:50] answer don't take Sunday for an
[1:05:53] answer don't take another day for an
[1:05:55] answer amen if we when we begin to think
[1:05:58] on these things you will begin to create
[1:06:00] an atmosphere around
[1:06:02] you that's why it is the time to believe
[1:06:07] because Believers when they begin to
[1:06:09] believe in possible situations through
[1:06:11] impossible things it begins to create an
[1:06:13] atmosphere around them that God can do
[1:06:16] what he said he would
[1:06:21] do and she was thinking on this and she
[1:06:23] ra raised her eyes and she thought she
[1:06:25] saw maybe a little Flicker and she
[1:06:30] thought what was that and she drops her
[1:06:32] little head again and pulls her Shaw up
[1:06:34] over her shoulders and she went
[1:06:36] on what did Isaiah 9:6
[1:06:41] mean listen to this statement when God
[1:06:44] puts something on a person's heart he's
[1:06:47] ready to do
[1:06:51] something Mercy Jesus
[1:06:54] that's the reason he's ready to give
[1:06:57] this place an outbreak of the spirit of
[1:07:00] God because it's on our
[1:07:05] hearts come on now amen it's because
[1:07:09] it's on our hearts and that she thought
[1:07:10] on these things and while she raised her
[1:07:13] head again she felt real strange and
[1:07:15] thought wow what is going on and he said
[1:07:17] I just love to feel the presence of the
[1:07:18] Holy Spirit it just gives me Blessed
[1:07:21] Assurance you don't always see it but
[1:07:23] it's there
[1:07:25] anyhow and as she's moving along she
[1:07:27] raises her head again and there stood
[1:07:29] that great light before her perhaps the
[1:07:32] same Pillar of Fire that led the
[1:07:33] children of Israel come walking from
[1:07:35] that light came an Archangel Gabriel and
[1:07:38] he said Hail Mary that means to
[1:07:41] stop blessed art thou among the
[1:07:49] women he said it's hard telling what the
[1:07:51] other
[1:07:52] women where they were at perhaps
[1:07:54] thinking about the washing they had to
[1:07:56] do or some task or something they had to
[1:08:00] do
[1:08:00] tomorrow brother Timothy it's Christmas
[1:08:04] I got still a lot of shopping to
[1:08:06] do you already thought about that ain't
[1:08:09] you I forgot to get the sour
[1:08:15] cream all kinds of things are going
[1:08:17] through our
[1:08:18] minds but if we'll keep him on our mind
[1:08:21] something will take place Hallelujah say
[1:08:26] Amen if we keep thinking on him and how
[1:08:28] great he is and how marvelous marvelous
[1:08:31] he is and how wonderful and how amazing
[1:08:34] and how powerful and how he answers
[1:08:36] prayer and how he how he touches
[1:08:39] Hearts I've seen him do it over here and
[1:08:42] I've seen him do it over there so I know
[1:08:43] he's still that kind of God I've seen
[1:08:46] him provide for this one so I know if he
[1:08:48] Pro if he provided for that one he's my
[1:08:50] provider too I seen him heal that one so
[1:08:53] I know if he healed he's my healer
[1:08:57] too amen things begin to change when you
[1:09:00] start thinking about him that's why the
[1:09:03] devil is always trying to keep our minds
[1:09:05] on something else we come we make all
[1:09:08] the effort we drive miles we go we beat
[1:09:11] ourselves trying to get off of work and
[1:09:13] we get here and we're so tired and
[1:09:14] sleepy sometimes or or this thing on our
[1:09:17] mind and we got that going on what is it
[1:09:19] he is trying to get our minds on
[1:09:21] something instead of on his appearing
[1:09:24] instead of his instead of him coming
[1:09:26] where he said where two or three are
[1:09:27] gathered in my name there I will be I
[1:09:30] wonder if there's any marriage that's
[1:09:31] been thinking about that today I wonder
[1:09:33] if there's anybody that says you know
[1:09:35] what tonight's Wednesday night I believe
[1:09:37] God can move in such a marvelous way and
[1:09:40] it'll change hearts forever and the
[1:09:42] presence of God will fall in our midst
[1:09:43] like never before and healings will take
[1:09:46] place and it not only fall in this place
[1:09:48] but people are hearing on stream and
[1:09:50] they'll watching and healing will take
[1:09:52] place in their living room it it'll take
[1:09:54] place on their treadmill it'll take
[1:09:56] place wherever they
[1:09:59] are why because a Mary begin to get
[1:10:02] something on her
[1:10:04] mind other than her Christmas
[1:10:08] dinner or her Christmas present or this
[1:10:12] that and the
[1:10:14] other
[1:10:18] amen she saw this great Angel it
[1:10:20] startled her came close to her and
[1:10:23] saluted Ed her and gave her a
[1:10:27] message that was a hard message for her
[1:10:29] to
[1:10:30] believe a little virgin girl going to
[1:10:33] receive a
[1:10:35] child that was more outstanding and hard
[1:10:37] to believe than anything he had ever
[1:10:40] given to
[1:10:42] anyone sounds like the Mary of today
[1:10:45] believing for a body
[1:10:49] change a
[1:10:52] rapture not just one in Enoch not just a
[1:10:56] change as Elijah would take a chariot no
[1:11:00] a Rapture of a bride around the
[1:11:04] world Amen Mary believing that
[1:11:07] something's about to take place
[1:11:09] something is going to go something is
[1:11:11] going to happen something is happening
[1:11:14] and and know and and it was a hard thing
[1:11:16] for this little girl to
[1:11:18] believe 6 months before he had met with
[1:11:21] Zacharias and the the priest in the
[1:11:22] temple a priest a preacher who should
[1:11:25] know the words who who should know an
[1:11:27] angel when he sees an angel who should
[1:11:30] believe when he hears him speak to him
[1:11:33] but he doubted him and from his doubt he
[1:11:36] took away his speech that's
[1:11:43] right he said how can this be I'm old my
[1:11:46] wife is old and he had plenty of
[1:11:48] examples in the
[1:11:50] Bible he had Hannah in the temple he had
[1:11:53] he had had that never had a baby and was
[1:11:55] had had a child he had had Sarah that
[1:11:58] would was way almost almost 100 years
[1:12:00] old over 90 years old when she had
[1:12:04] Isaac and here this little woman had to
[1:12:06] believe something that never happened a
[1:12:10] woman having a baby without knowing a
[1:12:12] man she said how shall these things be
[1:12:15] my Lord I want you to understand
[1:12:16] something that was not a question of
[1:12:18] doubt that was like help me just to
[1:12:22] understand help me to know how you going
[1:12:24] to do this cuz I know I can't do this I
[1:12:27] know I cannot make my body change I know
[1:12:31] I cannot receive a child without knowing
[1:12:33] a man it said it's scientifically
[1:12:37] impossible he said the Holy Ghost shall
[1:12:40] overshadow thee and the holy thing that
[1:12:42] shall be born of thee shall be called
[1:12:43] The Son of God watch her now she didn't
[1:12:46] question that she said behold the hands
[1:12:50] made unto the Lord be it unto me
[1:12:55] that's be it unto me according to what
[1:12:58] you have
[1:13:00] said according to Thy word what you have
[1:13:03] spoken be it unto me come on do we have
[1:13:07] any marriage here tonight and said Lord
[1:13:09] you said it now be it unto
[1:13:11] me you said by my stripes your heal be
[1:13:15] it unto me according to Thy word I
[1:13:18] believe what you
[1:13:19] [Applause]
[1:13:22] say if we could just do that he says
[1:13:25] that's what God loves that's the only
[1:13:28] way to get right with God is to take him
[1:13:30] at his word that's the only way there is
[1:13:32] to please God is to take him and don't
[1:13:34] trust your knowledge you'll reason at
[1:13:36] all how can this be done and can't be
[1:13:38] done when you reason you lose the
[1:13:41] victory we must cast down reasons and
[1:13:44] believe what God Said is the
[1:13:48] truth Mary took him at his word and he
[1:13:51] changed the whole course of night
[1:13:53] natural life for
[1:13:54] her he will change the course of your
[1:13:57] life tonight if you'll take him at his
[1:14:01] word hallelujah if you're a sinner he
[1:14:04] will straighten that crooked life out if
[1:14:06] you're vile and immoral he'll make you
[1:14:08] pure as a lily if you'll just take him
[1:14:10] at his word that vile conscious of sin
[1:14:12] that makes you look at immoral things
[1:14:14] and use the name of the Lord in vain
[1:14:16] have tempered enough to fight a buzz all
[1:14:18] he'll change that course of life for you
[1:14:21] if you'll just take him at his
[1:14:27] word if you have cancer tonight he'll
[1:14:30] change that for you and bring you
[1:14:34] health it's in all he's the Lord God
[1:14:38] that heals all th diseases if you have
[1:14:40] tuberculosis or sickness of any kind
[1:14:43] that the doctors cannot help he will
[1:14:45] change that for you if you take him at
[1:14:46] his word and this is his
[1:14:50] word I am the Lord thy God that heals
[1:14:54] all somebody say all all thy diseases at
[1:14:59] they be it unto me Here I Am Lord at Thy
[1:15:03] word what you have said I
[1:15:07] believe let it be
[1:15:11] done as soon as the angel had told her
[1:15:13] about her cousin and she accepted the
[1:15:16] Lord's will to be done the only thing
[1:15:18] she knew would happen that the Holy
[1:15:20] Spirit was going to do it if we could
[1:15:22] only get that settled in our
[1:15:24] hearts how can cancer be cured when the
[1:15:27] doctors give up it's not me to me to try
[1:15:29] to figure
[1:15:31] out is to take the word of the Holy
[1:15:34] Spirit he's the one that made the
[1:15:36] promise he's the one that confirms the
[1:15:38] promise he's the one that's obligated to
[1:15:40] the
[1:15:43] promise I want you he I want you to
[1:15:45] notice another little thing about Mary
[1:15:48] she didn't wait till she was
[1:15:52] positive
[1:15:54] well I'll just wait till I feel a little
[1:15:56] movement and then I'll say something
[1:15:58] about it no she didn't
[1:16:01] wait she didn't wait till she felt life
[1:16:04] or some physical sign that she was going
[1:16:06] to have this baby before she said
[1:16:08] anything about it God's word was good

[1:35:06] before the very son we admire today was
[1:35:10] not seen before it was made out of
[1:35:12] things that was not
[1:35:15] seen so if he could do that and we walk
[1:35:18] around on this thing all
[1:35:20] day we don't think nothing about it but
[1:35:23] it's a very creative word of God that
[1:35:26] spoke something out of
[1:35:29] nothing and that sun we look at and the
[1:35:31] moon we look at the stars we look at and
[1:35:33] we think wow that's amazing sometimes we
[1:35:36] take a moment to pause up and
[1:35:38] wow other night they had a beautiful it
[1:35:41] was a beautiful
[1:35:43] uh meteor shower that went over
[1:35:48] beautiful man it was just going over
[1:35:50] it's incredible it's amazing what God
[1:35:52] did out of
[1:35:55] nothing it was
[1:35:58] nothing nothing times nothing times
[1:36:01] nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing
[1:36:04] and he said let there
[1:36:09] be and it was and we look at it every
[1:36:13] day and don't think nothing about
[1:36:15] it so
[1:36:18] common it's just everyday occurrence the
[1:36:20] sun comes up
[1:36:22] it's been coming up for thousands of
[1:36:23] Year brother Timothy what's the big deal
[1:36:24] that's the spoken word of God that is a
[1:36:27] sign to you that his word
[1:36:31] works every
[1:36:35] day how much more could that
[1:36:38] God who created something out of nothing
[1:36:43] create a new liver check he's done that
[1:36:47] create a new heart check he's done that
[1:36:50] create a new stomach check he's done
[1:36:53] that come on now create a new pancreas
[1:36:56] check he's done
[1:36:58] that he's the
[1:37:01] Creator and he does things out of
[1:37:04] nothing but all he wants is
[1:37:06] someone to say be it unto
[1:37:10] me at Thy
[1:37:12] word at Thy word I'm just going to take
[1:37:16] you at what you
[1:37:18] said I don't have to figure it all out I
[1:37:20] don't have to add it all up you said I
[1:37:22] could have the Holy Ghost I accept
[1:37:26] it I let my life just die out say Lord
[1:37:30] take
[1:37:31] me I take you Lord as my king and my
[1:37:34] Lord be it unto me it's not algebra it's
[1:37:39] not
[1:37:40] geometry it's dying out and saying be it
[1:37:44] unto
[1:37:45] me at Thy word we need some more
[1:37:49] Marys amen
[1:37:51] that'll just look that angel in the face
[1:37:53] and
[1:37:55] say I don't know how all this is going
[1:37:57] to happen but it doesn't matter
[1:38:00] how all that matters is you
[1:38:03] said and at Thy
[1:38:07] word we go back to those disciples for a
[1:38:10] moment they sitting on their
[1:38:13] stump fished all
[1:38:15] night discouraged yeah they was
[1:38:18] discouraged wanted to give up
[1:38:22] they knew how to fish there fish there's
[1:38:24] fishermen they wasn't somebody just
[1:38:26] bought a boat and decided to go fishing
[1:38:27] it's what they
[1:38:29] did and they knew all the tricks they
[1:38:31] knew when they biting they knew all the
[1:38:32] things that how to throw a net how to do
[1:38:34] how to hang it how to do and here they
[1:38:38] stumped and they're like man we've just
[1:38:40] done this all night long and didn't get
[1:38:43] one
[1:38:44] fish we tried everything we could and
[1:38:47] didn't get one
[1:38:50] thing
[1:38:51] and as they sitting there one of them
[1:38:53] said well here comes that preacher
[1:38:56] guy let's see what he going to say so I
[1:39:00] can see that old Apostle get a chunk and
[1:39:01] sit down and begin to L listen he said
[1:39:04] man there's something different about
[1:39:05] this
[1:39:06] fell he moves his chunk of stump a
[1:39:09] little
[1:39:10] closer till he's finally standing right
[1:39:12] beside
[1:39:13] him cuz there was something about him
[1:39:16] that Drew him to
[1:39:19] Jesus there's something about Jesus
[1:39:21] Jesus that Drew him he said he still got
[1:39:23] the same power if I be lifted up I will
[1:39:27] draw all men unto
[1:39:29] me we were just talking about this the
[1:39:31] other day brother Jeremy kkin is not
[1:39:34] here he's up up there now with his wife
[1:39:36] and brother Ben puit church but he was
[1:39:38] saved there at a youth camp we're just
[1:39:41] going back through it again with someone
[1:39:42] the other day was talking about how the
[1:39:43] first night he just sat on the very back
[1:39:46] as far as he could get nearly but Tim
[1:39:49] and instructed the gator Patrol we call
[1:39:51] him the deacons not to say anything cuz
[1:39:53] normally we try to keep the young people
[1:39:54] up but we knew he was a special special
[1:39:58] guy wasn't there because he wanted to
[1:40:01] he's there because his uncle tricked him
[1:40:02] let's just be honest said you want to go
[1:40:04] camping so he's going camping shows up
[1:40:06] at a youth camp whatever you got to do
[1:40:08] to get him there before the
[1:40:11] Lord I admire that so he did he had a
[1:40:14] see what happened was and let's just put
[1:40:16] it out very plainly something had come
[1:40:18] on brother Jeff's heart for Him and when
[1:40:21] something comes on somebody's heart
[1:40:22] God's about to do
[1:40:24] something in the first night he's all
[1:40:27] the way in the back and as the service
[1:40:28] is progress he's he's getting closer and
[1:40:31] getting closer and getting closer till
[1:40:33] he's sitting nearly on the front row if
[1:40:34] not the front row until that Saturday
[1:40:37] morning when it gave his heart to God to
[1:40:39] be changed from that time forever more
[1:40:42] if I be lifted
[1:40:45] up if I be lifted up this is what the
[1:40:48] preaching of the word does it's lifting
[1:40:50] him up out of history it's lifting him
[1:40:52] up off the pages of the Bible and
[1:40:54] showing you he is the same yesterday
[1:40:56] today and forever I will draw all men
[1:41:00] unto
[1:41:01] me and here he is being lifted up and
[1:41:04] it's drawing Peter closer and closer and
[1:41:08] closer the crowd got so great he stepped
[1:41:12] on the boat and Peter said to Peter
[1:41:15] Thrust out a little bit I want to preach
[1:41:17] a while stood there and begin to preach
[1:41:19] a while
[1:41:21] then after he got through he borrowed
[1:41:23] Simon's boat he never borrows anything
[1:41:27] unless he pays for
[1:41:30] it you can't outg give
[1:41:33] God he said now Simon I want you to
[1:41:35] thrust out into the deep launch out he
[1:41:38] said I'd like to speak on that just for
[1:41:40] a moment launch out that's what the
[1:41:42] trouble with people's faith is tonight
[1:41:44] you're afraid to turn it
[1:41:47] loose come on somebody there's many of
[1:41:50] you that's got faith but you're afraid
[1:41:52] to let it loose your faith without works
[1:41:55] is
[1:41:56] dead just as the body without the spirit
[1:42:00] is dead if you got faith show me your
[1:42:02] faith by your works now Paul was
[1:42:04] justifying Abraham by faith James
[1:42:06] Justified him by works Paul said Abraham
[1:42:08] was justified Romans 4 by faith so James
[1:42:11] come over and said he justify works by
[1:42:12] both of them one confirmed the other
[1:42:15] Paul was speaking what God saw his faith
[1:42:18] Jesus James was speaking what man saw
[1:42:21] works so if you say I got faith in God
[1:42:23] and afraid to put your faith to work
[1:42:26] it's not good you have to launch it
[1:42:29] out that's what's a matter many of
[1:42:32] people are afraid to launch out you're
[1:42:34] afraid to venture a little bit just to
[1:42:36] say well I can I can do all things with
[1:42:38] Christ to strength amen look at him said
[1:42:40] launch out into the
[1:42:46] deep you see somebody jumping up and
[1:42:49] down in about 4ot of water saying they
[1:42:51] can swim you know they can't
[1:42:55] swim they ain't prove nothing I don't
[1:42:57] care how much they say they can swim oh
[1:42:59] yeah but you get them in over their
[1:43:04] heads you get them in over their
[1:43:06] heads amen it'll it'll it'll determine
[1:43:09] right then if they can swim or if
[1:43:11] they're going to
[1:43:12] drown that's what brother brand talked
[1:43:14] about he said he said you got to launch
[1:43:17] out you got to get out deep enough amen
[1:43:19] what was one of the problems going off
[1:43:21] with this one of the prophets in the Old
[1:43:22] Testament said I I was Waters ankle deep
[1:43:25] and then all the way and said then we
[1:43:26] got into Waters to swim
[1:43:29] in come on now God wants to take you
[1:43:32] further and further and further until
[1:43:35] you don't have no more support under
[1:43:38] you you can't support yourself no more
[1:43:41] you can't do nothing about it no more
[1:43:43] you don't know you can just flop around
[1:43:45] all you want to but I on you're wrong
[1:43:47] you can't do nothing about it so he
[1:43:49] takes you out in places that you will
[1:43:52] know when you get there this has nothing
[1:43:54] to do with me it's all about
[1:43:58] him and he took Peter to a place that he
[1:44:01] knew I know there's no fish here I done
[1:44:04] tried it on my own it's impossible
[1:44:06] launch out the deep and let down for the
[1:44:12] drought what Lord we fished all night
[1:44:16] well I've tried so many
[1:44:19] services I've tried so many times Lord
[1:44:23] I've tried and I've tried and I've tried
[1:44:27] that's right you
[1:44:28] tried now he's telling you go on out a
[1:44:31] little deeper throw down your
[1:44:35] net Peter looks at all of that and he
[1:44:38] says but at Thy
[1:44:41] word at Thy word I'm going to let down
[1:44:45] the
[1:44:45] net and he lets down the
[1:44:49] net
[1:44:51] he said see there's a secret at Thy word
[1:44:53] taking God at his word just face value
[1:44:56] what he said it's what he said take it
[1:44:59] at his word if there was no fish there
[1:45:01] God will put a fish
[1:45:03] there he did do it the same net that
[1:45:06] went through the water all night long
[1:45:09] and caught
[1:45:11] nothing I went through the service after
[1:45:13] service after service and I caught
[1:45:15] nothing but when God said put it right
[1:45:18] there and tonight you may have sang
[1:45:21] through every doctor's office you may
[1:45:23] have sang through every healing meeting
[1:45:25] you may have sang through every service
[1:45:27] but tonight at Thy word Lord I put on
[1:45:31] the net that's the way it is at Thy word
[1:45:33] I'm going to let it down cuz you told me
[1:45:36] if I ask anything in your name there you
[1:45:38] would do it and I believe it to be the
[1:45:40] truth and I'm letting it down at your
[1:45:44] command Don't Be Afraid ask a whole
[1:45:49] lot
[1:45:52] see it wasn't Jesus desire to give him
[1:45:54] two
[1:45:56] fish that's what we you know we our our
[1:45:58] minds we think well I just get a little
[1:46:00] bit that'll bit no big things are as
[1:46:03] easy to ask for as little things cuz but
[1:46:06] with God nothing there's no difference
[1:46:08] between a big thing and a little thing
[1:46:10] it's all the same to him and just as
[1:46:12] easy to perform it does not matter if
[1:46:14] it's a tooth acers if it's cancer it
[1:46:16] doesn't matter if it's sin or whatever
[1:46:18] it is amen a little thing big thing that
[1:46:20] has not that's that's only in our own
[1:46:21] human intellect we add things up how we
[1:46:24] think they ought to go first place
[1:46:26] second place third place fourth place
[1:46:28] God doesn't do any of that it's all the
[1:46:30] same to him he just says
[1:46:34] ask and ye shall receive you may have
[1:46:38] tried time after time but you have not
[1:46:41] because you ask not and you ask not
[1:46:43] because you believe not ask and you
[1:46:45] shall receive and will let down for the
[1:46:48] draw he said I seen that little Apostle
[1:46:50] running in the big S out in the water
[1:46:52] getting ready and when he begin to pull
[1:46:53] on that net he made a couple pulls there
[1:46:55] was nothing and while something was

[1:47:13] line Hallelujah something's on the end
[1:47:16] of the line God will put a fish there
