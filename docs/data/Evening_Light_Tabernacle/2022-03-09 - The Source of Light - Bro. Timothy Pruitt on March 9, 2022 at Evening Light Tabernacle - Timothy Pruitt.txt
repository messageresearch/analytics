same god is moving again you believe that amen just thinking about that prayer request for brother ron and how we saw how we saw the lord moving his life so many different times i remember being at youth camp and uh those first sermons that he preached after he'd been burned and andrew spencer and i just stood right behind that curtain the entire service waiting to just run out and grab him if if he fell over and uh and the lord just brought him so far from that and gave him a new set of lungs and man we believe that the same god that gave him a new set of lungs can completely take away this cancer not just for brother ron but for each one of these needs that we've mentioned here tonight the ones that were lifted to him he's the same god giving us exceeding abundant amen amen let's stand together key of g sing that song fill my cup lord i lift it up to you tonight amen don't you just want to just overflow tonight with those blessings of god amen lord i lift it up [Music] my soul

father minister the needs of your people lord we need you father lord as never before we ask father that you would be the source of our strength the source of our healing tonight lord the source of everything we have need of is in you father and we're thankful tonight you're the inexhaustible fountain of life lord you never run out you never have run out of healing deliverance salvation lord you still are more than enough lord you're represented there in the old testament is that cruise of oil lord that never ran out that barrel of meal that never ran out father oh god what a blessing and an honor it is lord to see the things that we see and to know lord in the middle of our trials that you're there for us and not only are you there for us you're more than enough lord we commit this service to your hands everything to be said and done for your glory in jesus name amen amen turn to john first john 1 and verse 5 amen read this scripture you can be seated first john 1 and verse 5. this then is the message which we have heard of him and declared unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all amen god bless you can be seated tonight i'd like to speak to you on the source of light the source of light source is a person placer thing this is a webster dictionary from which something comes from or can be obtained other words for source is origin birthplace arthurship wellspring pedigree root beginning origination or originator amen we find god in every one of those words amen that he is the origin of life he is the birthplace of life he authored it he's the wellspring amen he's the root he's the beginning he's the origination or the originator god is the source of light and all things exist by him we can read in romans 11 verse 36 it says for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever a man or i'll read it in the amplified it says for from him all things originate and through him all things live and exist and to him are all things directed to him be glory and honor forever you know we all need sources in our lives that we can depend upon a source is a supplier of something that we cannot produce on our own for example you know in your home you want to be warm during the winter you need a source of heat the gas line coming into your house is one of your sources electric lines are another source but you know there's also financial sources and food sources and government sources and sources that are to make our lives easier or more enjoyable or more productive but those so as we have found out very recently and and very evidently that those sources are subject to shortages and interruptions and can be in a short supply but not so with god if god is our source he is never in short supply if god is our source he's the perfect and on-time source for everything that you have need of so as a source is something that provides something that you cannot provide on your own so we cannot provide on our own healing but he is our source of healing we cannot provide on our own salvation but he is our source of salvation we cannot provide on our own amen peace and happiness and men has tried it for years but amen he is the true source of peace and happiness he is the true source of joy and to receive from this source you have to be connected to the source amen jeremiah 17 and verse 7 again in the amplified says blessed is the man who believes and trusts in and relies in the lord and whose hope and confidence has has hope and confident expectation is the lord so if he had if he's if he's connected to him and he has hope in him and he trusts in him he says in verse 8 for he will be nourished like a tree planted by the waters and spread out his roots by the river and will never fear the heat when it comes but its leaves will be green and moist and it will not be anxious and concerned in the year of drought neither shall it stop bearing fruit because why it is connected to the source so it doesn't matter the surroundings it doesn't it matters that you're connected to the source it does not matter that there's a severe heat or there's a drought of things in life but what matters is if you're connected to the source a man that is connected to the source will bear hit fruit no matter the drought no matter the heat no matter the trials no matter their tribulation no matter the trouble no matter the stress he will bear fruit why because he's connected to the source amen but if he's not connected to the source when trials come and the heat comes on he will rapidly dry up amen so you have to be connected to him but if you have a need of that you have a source for it so if you have a need of strength and you cannot produce the strength on your own there is a source of strength amen and he's not in short supply tonight amen there is a source of hope there is a source of love there and i'm not talking about a temporary thing i'm talking about an eternal thing amen there is a source of peace there is a source of provisions there is a source of healings there's a a source of deliverance but it you must be tapped into the source and be connected to the source or you will dry up amen you know we we can have light bulbs in here as we have maybe already spoke about these things and they can look like a light bulb they can they can be exactly you could have one you know there that what maybe not burning all of them are burning tonight except the one that's not in but amen the other end zone maybe there'd be one in your home that's not burning but it looks like a light bulb it has all the physical attributes of looking but but there's something wrong with it it's not giving light and so you go to checking it out and you'll find that sooner or later you'll find a break amen in the line from the source from the source of electricity and it may look like it he may it may have the attributes of it but if it says not connected to the source it'll never bring forth light i don't care how much you beg it i don't care how much you you look at it and plead with it hey man if you don't if it's a switch that needs to be flipped or if it's a wire that needs to be plugged in it has to be connected to the source or it will never give light amen this is what's wrong with a lot of christians they look like christians they have the attributes of christians they they may have the outward look down pat but amen they're not given the light of god's word god's word has never been made manifested in their lives and therefore the light is not shining as it should shine in their lives amen i want to look at a quote here because it's very wonderful brother branham talks about it he says you know you can have teeth and how many got teeth tonight i'm not going to ask how many got artificial teeth tonight but there's no doubt some in this building that's got an artificial tooth in their mouth or artificial teeth in their mouth amen and that artificial teeth it is not connected to the source of life no more amen you can have an arm that that gets cut off or a bad accident or something and you can get an artificial limb and it may work it may do things you may can put clothes over it you may can put a glove on the hand and it may look like it but it's not really connected to the source amen and he says see those teeth are just a substitute that arm is just a substitute and they will never come into the resurrection because they're not connected with you amen he says it's not connected with you it's perfectly all right but that's an artificial tooth that's an artificial arm nothing artificial will come up in the resurrection and he says neither will an artificial christian ever rise in the resurrection amen you're not connected with christ amen and maybe today you may have not an artificial arm but you might have artificial hair you might have artificial nails you might have artificial things upon you that you think makes you look more beautiful but nothing artificial is going to come up in the resurrection and if you continue to be artificial in your life neither will you come up in the resurrection but you must be connected to the source of life you must be connected to god himself and light coming out of your body and out of your life amen and be connected to him there to bring forth the life of almighty god amen so we see here amen you know you know but there has to be a a desire amen a light a pulsation a energizing force amen that is more than just a outward profession it's more than just talking about it it's more than just looking like it but there's something on the inside of you that that energizes you that that produces something amen you know but could you imagine as we go into this thought on light again the source of light could you imagine a man saying today i refuse to say there's anything such as a son i don't believe in the son amen could you imagine he runs down into his basement and shuts the doors and he sets back from the darkness and he says there's no such a thing as a sun it don't give light you know right away there's something mentally wrong with that man because you have witnessed there is a sun it's given light we witness it today amen once again it was a beautiful sight after a long rainy day amen the sun given this warmth and and the and the rays of that sun pushing down upon you amen you would look at that man and say you're crazy because i've witnessed it i i've seen it i felt it i i felt the warmth of its embraces in the morning i i felt the look as it would it so illuminate the world around me and the darkness would flee i know there's a sun because i've seen it i felt it i believe it i i know it's there it's no different than somebody that wants to come to you now and tell you that when you've experienced god for yourself that there's no god and they want to run off in a basement somewhere and act like there's no god and say there's no god but you have you can look at them and say you know what there's something mentally wrong with you there's something wrong on the inside of you because i know i have met him for myself i have felt his embrace i have felt the rays of his warmth around me i know there is a god and he has changed my life forever amen there's something wrong when he runs in the back basement and refuses to accept the benefits of god-given light and i can say this there's something wrong with people when the god-given light is preached and they won't accept the benefits of it they won't accept the life-changing benefits of the word of god and the light to dawn and push out the darkness in their life but they want to continue to live in that darkness you don't have to continue to live in darkness when there's light if you're living in darkness today is because you're mentally and stable you're spiritually unstable amen because right now there's there's if there's ever been never been i don't even know how to put this in words if there's never there's never been a more greater time amen to living life than the time that we're living in right now the dumbest excuse that can be given today is there is no light because the light has dawned amen he don't want the warm rays he rejects them he don't want the health-giving substance he rejects them he don't want his light to walk in it he would rather sit in darkness they don't want it they can be preached light can come forth and it can dawn it can illuminate people say i want it and run to an altar or grab a hold in their seats or wherever and others sit right beside them and refuse it and sit in darkness something spiritually wrong with that person there's something mentally wrong with that person that they refuse to accept the light of the sun there's something spiritually wrong with a man that'll run back to a creed or a dogma and refuse to see the bible light when it's shining right before them there's something wrong with them there's something that it goes back to the they go back to the creeds and the foreign and just shuts the door and says there's no such a thing as that days of miracles are passed divine healing there's no such a thing that was just for a possible apostle that man is spiritually crazy that's the prophet's words right there i i i'll refer to the prophet's authority that man is spiritually crazy there's something wrong with him he's pulled down the curtains and rejected the holy ghost amen because his word said if you abide in me and my words on you then the light shining upon this word ask what you will amen there's something wrong when they would reject god-given sources that god has given us to live by his word and they reject it amen you know man shall not live by bread alone but by every word not part of a word but every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god and when a man will just refuse that there's something wrong with that person there's something wrong with his experience that he claims to love god but then refuses god hello somebody oh i love god i go to church but then you refuse his word when it comes to you amen and you continue on in your artificial christianity and that artificial christianity is not going to come up in the resurrection it's not going to listen anything you got on you right now that's artificial is not going to come up amen it's not going to take the body change our cars are not going into body change this building is not going in the body change your clothes is not going into body change come on somebody the things you put on your body and the all that is not going into body change it's artificial there's something wrong with that person you know you say well i tell you what if i could just see see somebody get healed then i'll believe well how many do you need to see get healed i'll tell you just like the fella talked to brother branham one day said i don't care if you bring 50 cancers and bring 50 doctors to testify i still wouldn't believe i don't care if you'd raise the dead right before me i still wouldn't believe there's something wrong with that person amen and yet the man was a minister supposed to be a minister but just because that organization didn't believe in the power of god don't don't don't believe that the word it meant just what it didn't believe that the word meant just what it said that man runs to this old basement oh musty dirty filthy basement of organization and refuses the warmth life-giving rays of the holy spirit jesus christ which is the same yesterday today and forever something's wrong with that person you would rather live in that musty darkness you would rather live with that cankeredness on your life and that bitterness on your life and that unforgiving spirit has nothing but musty stinking darkness but there's a light that can do away with the darkness there's a god that can wash you of that and cleanse you of that and raise you up whole again they want the mustiness they they're comfortable in that darkness something wrong with that person they can say i'm a christian they cannot miss a service but if they got bitterness in their heart to where they won't forgive somebody there's something wrong with that person not coming up in the right your bitterness is not going in the resurrection and if you've got it in you you ain't going either it's going to take perfect love it's going to take forgiveness and letting things go and saying god i'm not going with this stuff i'm not walking with it no more i lay it all aside hey man i loved how brother wendell illustrated the other day you know you want to poison somebody but yet you're drinking the poison amen is killing you day by day and your life is killing you your artificial christian life is killing you your artificial is about amen even even in your just your your home life and thing it is killing you would rather live in a musty darkness than the live in the light of god and the bible said when bible the bible says jesus christ is the same today yesterday today and forever the works that i do shall you do also even greater than this shall you do for i go to my father but men i look at that scripture and go right back to the basement said that it was only for the apostles or that was only for brother branham and they refused to see the light that's shining in this day this light was not just for 50 years ago this light is for dead today amen these works that i do shall ye do also and greater than this shall you too hallelujah but there's something wrong with that person that'll walk away from that something wrong with your experience when you say you love god and you refuse his word no matter what the church says in this condition and and things cannot be as god promised is because you won't even receive the word or walk in the light the bible said let us walk in the light as he is the light amen then the blood of jesus christ god's son cleanses us from all sin unbelief that if we're walking in god-given light of the hour then god takes that word that's given for the hour and vindicates it just like he did in genesis 1 3 when he said let there be light and light come forth that sun was the vindication of let there be light amen his word went forth and light followed it and cleared away the mustiness and the darkness and and the midst and it pushed darkness over into a quarter and lights begin to shine that's the way god does today he sends his word for the hour and the holy spirit comes and makes that word live that's why we got to have the manifestation of the spirit in our services because if you don't have him in your midst the word can never live hallelujah amen you say well i got the word but if you don't have the spirit of the word that word is dead creeds and dogmas that's the way god does today he sends the word for this hour and the holy spirit comes and makes that word live and the darkness goes on and the creeds in artificial ways and denominations but lightness begins to shine because it's the word of god being vindicated you know we find in the bible we could read about the wise men that came and they followed what brandon would call that light he'd call that light that hung there a god-given substance they followed the word of god to the light because it was the word that brought the light to light to life brought that to life he says how did how did they follow well they would kind of magize and we understand and then we find in balaam there was a word spoken by balaam the prophet that said a star would rise out of jacob yes all right a star would rise out of jacob and when these men saw the word of god said a star would rise out of jacob they followed that little god-given token to the source of eternal light they followed the manifested word there was a star that's going to rise out of jacob and one day that word had laid there for thousands of years and seemed to be dormant and people forgot it and might a matter of fact it was given by prophet balaam and we know who balaam was but it was still amen the true anointed word of god that came forth and he speaks it and out of him amen amen out of him speaks us where the stars gonna rise up and one day the word met the moment and at the moment the spirit of god picked up that word and a star rose up and there was a star hanging there and there's three men a way over however many way over there and they see the star rise up in the east and they say there's the word and there's a manifestation now let's follow the light to the eternal source hallelujah amen this is exactly what we have done in this day the seven angels came in this hour and it brought a message in this hour and it was a message for moments and that moment had arrived after it laid there for thousands of years but the moment is now time for the word to be vindicated and a star rose up and men that are spiritual are catching the moment and they're following that word to the eternal source of light hallelujah back to eternity again he said so they said they followed that little god-given token to the source of eternal light it was quite astounding when they got there the source of eternal life was a little little baby or a little child didn't look like maybe much but the star led them there looked very humble and it looked like ah he just can't be maybe to some but those men had seen the word being made manifest and they saw the star hanging over and they went to where the star pointed to amen it may look like what we have ain't much compared to other world systems may look like it's just a little humble thing but a star led us to this place a spiritual light led us to this place hallelujah and it's more than just a little something it's eternal life laying there amen and i want to grasp it with everything that i have and i believe there's people in this building and say god i strip every artificial thing away from me i want to lay it all aside and if there'd be any darkness in me let your light shine on me he said so were wise men today who's not blinded by creeds will follow god-given spoken word till they see the fullness of the power of god blooming forth in this hour wow god is a source you know it didn't matter how many other wise men tried to tell them you're out of your minds why you're way out it's two out of two years to get over there pass by many nations nations will ask where you going see that star right there that's where i'm going you're crazy why are you following that star because underneath it's laying the messiah underneath it is laying the promise of isaiah that was given 600 years ago behold the virgins how conceived and bring forth a son and his name shall be called emmanuel you're nuts you're crazy amen well here we are now what 50 years 60 years 70 years amen past the dawning amen of the message and people are saying you're crazy this is crazy that's crazy that's nuts this is nuts and we're saying i'm not listening to what you got to say i'm following a star i'm not listening to your youtube channels and your disbelief the sign nonsense i'm following a star i'm following the word of god because it's me amen beyond that at that place is when i'm gonna step out of this immortal body into immortality and let me tell you something devil you ain't got enough devils in hell to stop me from getting to where he's at i don't know yeah amen you can try everything you can try to flood the waters you can try to burn the hills you can try to put every road rocking our way but this bride is going to go all the way to where he's at and we shall meet him we've seen a star and we've come to worship him they come into jerusalem denominational headquarters they had no answer they went up down the streets crying where is he born king of the jews they knew nothing about it they called on the word to find out and they followed knowing the star was leading them to the eternal light guide us to thy perfect light the word is what guides you to the light and the light is what makes the word vindicated it was an angel of god that would show as a light up on a hill to god's shepherds to eternal light it only comes by light that's why this message is so wonderful because it's been vindicated by a light to where even documented amen documentation has been done that this was not the flash of a camera it was a light that struck the lens life can only come by light the shepherds wanting to know they you know when the king is born they have seen and great carrying on when the king is born and here he was so secretly born and born in a stable manger horses were cattle horses even yet he was a king and the angels came down and sang the hymns to the shepherds in the light and the angels themselves were lights that showed with the word of god they had the word of god and they told him today in the city of david in bethlehem is born christ the savior and the angels had the word and the word came by light and the light was to guide them to where he was hallelujah oh my what i'm thankful for they didn't get halfway there and the light go out hallelujah amen those three wise men they didn't get halfway there or three quarters of the way there or just a mile away and the light went out when they got to him oh hallelujah we don't have to worry about what's him running out of a source he is a source of light light is beaming out of him and it's a light it comes i mean it's a call that comes a ringing over a restless way and it's calling me out of this world into another world it's calling me out of this dimension into another dimension is anybody else seeing the light is it calling you is it pulling you is there a lie that's drawing you and saying come on little children keep walking in the line you're walking the right pathway it's going to get difficult it's going to be darkness around but in your place in your path there's gonna be light cause this light will never go out they ain't enough devils can blow it out they did enough youtube videos and every kind of thing they want to throw up forget it go smoke your pot and drink your beers and have a party go have fun leave us alone we're enjoying ourselves we ain't hurting nobody i don't understand somebody that was so terrorized and so tormented by leaving the message they got to make videos and they got to make all these kind of accusations and come up with all these fabricated stories has to be fabricated because they weren't even there why where's the camera pointing at me go enjoy yourself have your party enjoy sodom enjoy why it burns around your ears but one day you're going to hear the screams of your children and you're going to hear the screams of every person that you drawed off and you pulled away and you're going to hear them scream and you're going to see the darkness that you put in in their minds and the darkness and infiltrated your life and them spirits are going to be laughing at you and making part of you you think you're doing something making fun of us wait till that devil starts making fun of you i don't even know why i'm going that way but i'm going come on go have yourself a time well it all burns he was the word the word made light and became light the word in that generation he was the word light of that generation because the prophets of old had spoke of him and here he come and vindicated he was the light of god's spoken word and all the prophets had been fulfilled had said had been fulfilled in him and the prophets back here in the word just like god at the beginning let there be light a prophet comes and says a virgin shall conceive and bring forth the son they shall call his name emmanuel and it be god with us and they spoke it and the word went out and he was the light what was it what was he he was the fulfillment of the word which brought light god's word so it is today god's word has been fulfilled in the hour that we're living in that's the light it's god manifests himself he is the light of the world people think this is dark right now you wait till the light goes out you wait because there's no more bride no more mercy and they're sealing their lives away in their own blood darkness we ain't even seen darkness we could turn out every lightness building and each one of us hold a candle a little candle well brandon would talk about that he would talk about the darkness and he said every once in a while in that darkness you'll see a little light he said that's that's a christian we could have little candles burning and all these other lights turned out and it seemed pretty dark it would feel pretty dark then a few blows out and it gets darker as they cross on to the other side why is it getting darker because more lights are going out more devils are pushing into this realm and they're actually taking the the the space that was once occupied by light that's the only way darkness can come is because it has to be in the absence of light so at light has to leave for darkness to come in so when lights leave darkness comes in and darkness comes in and darkness wait to ever goes out then how dark is it going to be no wonder the scripture says they'll be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth one because they'll be remembering what a chance they had amen two is they can't be they can't see no more where they're going and their imaginations begin to run wild when's your mind when does your imagination run the wildest in the dark amen at night when you'll have a bad dream amen in the darkness when you're walking down the road i was just the other day back in the trailer out on on the backside of our property and i'm gonna tell you right now i felt like i had eyes pushing right through me and i'm kind of my hair is raising up on the back of my neck and i'm looking around i thought if that peacock walks out your imagination starts going crazy in the dark amen you're reading revelations about imaginations and spirits coming out and like hair and teeth and all what is it it's cause it's dark when the prophet's inspired by the holy spirit said unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and his name shall be called counselor prince of peace mighty god everlasting father there it was the light began to push until the moment was time and it fell upon the word and the word was illuminated and it came forth amen when jesus was walking down the shoulders he would say if he would begin to speak amen the words you can destroy this temple but in three days i'll raise it up again why because there was a word spoken by david i'll not leave his soul in hell neither will i suffer my holy one to see corruption death was in darkness but he broke open the seals of death and he walked out of it and he brought light again he was the light amen amen on the day of pentecost that was the light that showed when the holy ghost had come when isaiah amen said precept upon precept isaiah the 28th chapter preceptor must be on precept lying upon lie hear a little there literally hold fast to that which is good for with stammering lips and with other tongues well i speak to this people amen why does people not quote that no more this is the rest this is a sabbath and all and then all of this they would just wag their heads and make fun and laugh but on the day of pentecost when the holy ghost fell upon those people light fell upon that word and they walked away under the impact of the holy spirit acting like drunk men and women they walked and the others these others in darkness walked away wagging their head and said these people are drunk full of new wine and so forth but it was absolutely the light the word had prophesied for the moment and the moment was now to be fulfilled and light struck the word amen so it is in every age the word made manifest come to life by the light of that age there's a word made manifest just in genesis just to the prophets just through jesus this through amen the days of pentecost through lutheran wesleyan and zuzia's tree all the way to our day it was the light striking the word and he hasn't run out of light it's still fulfilling prophecy don't get your eyes on what's going on out there that's nothing but the fulfillment of prophecy there's light striking the word don't get caught up in the must the musty smells and the darkness and yes we pray for our brothers and sisters over there amen but what is happening god's fulfilling his word this article the other day talked about ukrainian jews now going back to their homeland that's right ain't that amazing god said if you ain't going to move i'm going to send somebody over here to move you amen what is a fulfilling prophecy there's no doubt some of them that are in those 144 000 and they have to be in the land and i'm going to tell every way we're son or daughter of god if you don't move god will send somebody or something that will move you every prodigal there is a word on your trail surely mercy and goodness will follow them all the days of their life and then one day the word meets the moment and light shines upon them and they say hey there's better things in my father's house i'm leaving this pig slop i'm leaving this whole world and i'm going back to my father's house hallelujah if we can see that's about to happen because god and we can see it moving the jews back it's also got to move the bride into her position prodigal we can't leave without you
