[0:16] And I've had a dog to my name and I had
[0:21] friends walked away.
[0:24] And I've even lost myself a time or
[0:31] two. There were bridges crossed and
[0:34] burned. But through all the wreckage, I
[0:38] have learned that there's one thing that
[0:42] I could never
[0:45] lose. If I got
[0:49] Jesus, I've got all that I could ever
[0:54] need. Take the world away from me. And
[0:58] I'll be okay if I got
[1:04] Jesus. There's a hope that's living deep
[1:08] inside. A joy that I could never hide.
[1:13] And a safe place to fall. If I've got
[1:18] Jesus, I've got it
[1:25] all. And I've seen weakness turn
[1:28] strength. And I've seen failures met
[1:32] with grace. And it's not from what I've
[1:35] done, but it's Christ to
[1:39] me. And a miracle I can't explain. Oh,
[1:44] he's given me his name. I'm the richest
[1:48] man that I could ever
[1:53] be. If I got
[1:56] Jesus, I've got all that I could ever
[2:01] need. Take the world away from me and
[2:05] I'll be okay. If I got
[2:10] Jesus, there's a hope that's living deep
[2:14] inside. A joy that I could never find
[2:18] and a safe place to fall. If I've got
[2:23] Jesus, I've got it
[2:27] all. Oh, and someday that trumpet's
[2:32] going to
[2:34] sound. And the king of heaven will ride
[2:38] upon the cloud coming
[2:41] down. I'll hit my knees, oh Lord, who
[2:45] sings my
[2:47] soul. I'm going
[2:51] home. If I got
[2:54] Jesus, well, I've got all that I could
[2:58] ever need. and take the world away from
[3:03] me and I'll be okay if I got
[3:09] Jesus. And there's a hope that's living
[3:12] deep inside. A joy that I can live by
[3:17] and a safe place to fall. If I got
[3:22] Jesus, well, I've got it all.
[3:27] If I've got
[3:29] Jesus, I've got it all.
