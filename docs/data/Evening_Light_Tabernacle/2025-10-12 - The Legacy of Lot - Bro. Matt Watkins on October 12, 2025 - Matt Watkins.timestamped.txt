[18:39] morning. Says I want to remember to a
[18:43] neighbor, sister Diane Simmonelli. He's
[18:45] 36 years old with a wife, a little girl.
[18:49] Uh, looks like his name is Jake. He had
[18:52] a heart attack and they put a pacemaker
[18:54] in and now he's got an infection. This
[18:57] went septic. No antibiotic is helped.
[19:00] He's on a vent. So unless God
[19:03] intervenes, there's not much hope. She
[19:06] said, "But I pray his story has a new
[19:08] chapter of life."
[19:10] Amen. So we want to remember that need.
[19:12] Want to also remember continue to
[19:14] remember our brother Ron and his body
[19:16] and needs there and just ask the Lord to
[19:19] come and do a complete work there.
[19:23] Amen. We're going to ask brother Andrew
[19:25] Spencer if you'd just come and open our
[19:27] service in prayer this morning. Amen.
[19:30] Let's just pray together for these needs
[19:32] and just ask the Lord to come by our
[19:34] way.
[19:36] [Music]
[19:38] Heavenly Father, we come before you,
[19:40] Lord, this morning realizing that you're
[19:42] the great I am. Lord Jesus, we have felt
[19:44] your August presence here already, Lord,
[19:46] this morning. What a wonderful thing it
[19:48] is for us as your children to know,
[19:50] Father, that you have a arm that is
[19:52] still steady and powerful enough to
[19:54] reach down to these needs, Lord, that
[19:56] might seem so significant, Lord, to us
[19:59] and so big, but God, you're a God that
[20:01] begins to speak and mountains begin to
[20:04] move out of the way. And this morning,
[20:06] Lord, we look to these needs, Father,
[20:08] and we say that mountain thou has to
[20:10] move in the name of Jesus. for brother
[20:12] Ron's case. We have seen you over and
[20:14] over again minister to him. But I pray a
[20:17] special blessing for sister Diane. Lord,
[20:20] this need that she has presented to you.
[20:22] Lord, every unspoken prayer request this
[20:24] morning. We ask that the Holy Spirit
[20:26] would come in a supernatural way this
[20:28] morning. Move through this congregation
[20:30] as we open up our hearts, Lord, to
[20:32] receive one more time from the very mind
[20:34] of God. Use our brother Watkins today to
[20:37] speak to us, Lord. and we'll be careful
[20:39] to serve you and give you all the praise
[20:40] and the honor and glory in the name of
[20:43] Jesus Christ. Amen.

[54:05] Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the Lord. God
[54:07] bless you. Such a privilege to be here.
[54:10] How many have just How many just want to
[54:12] tell the Lord, "Thank you for coming by
[54:15] my way."
[54:17] &gt;&gt; You want to tell the Lord that? Say,
[54:18] "God, thank you for coming and speaking
[54:20] to me." Why don't we just do that just
[54:22] now?
[54:24] Thank you, Jesus.
[54:27] Thank you for a touch, Lord. Thank you
[54:29] for a word of encouragement.
[54:33] Thank you for the hope you brought to
[54:36] fathers and mothers.
[54:38] Thank you for healing you brought to the
[54:40] afflicted and the diseased.
[54:43] Thank you for the salvation you brought
[54:46] to the lost.
[54:49] Lord, we believe you've done wonderful
[54:51] things in these meetings. We don't look
[54:53] to the physical evidence, though you
[54:55] give us that. We look to one thing, and
[54:58] that's you promised it and we believe
[55:00] it. And I pray God, the seed that's been
[55:03] sown in these meetings, may it be
[55:06] planted in good ground. May it bring
[55:09] forth, Lord, that which you intended it.
[55:13] For you promised, Lord, cast your bread
[55:16] upon the waters,
[55:19] and it won't return unto you void, but
[55:22] it will accomplish the purpose that it
[55:26] was sent for. I pray no one would leave
[55:29] here, Lord God, with a cup empty, but
[55:31] full Lord, full, oh God, with fresh
[55:35] faith, fresh zeal,
[55:39] Lord, a fresh ability to reach out at
[55:42] the impossible and take a hold of the
[55:44] promise of God for their life, for their
[55:46] family, for their marriage, for their
[55:48] children. We speak a blessing, Lord God,
[55:51] upon this church. May it be a renewed
[55:53] vision for evening like Tabernacle. May
[55:56] they look to the greater. May they look,
[55:58] Lord, don't ever stop pressing to that
[56:01] mark of the high calling in Christ
[56:03] Jesus. Let's look to new horizons, Lord.
[56:06] Let's look to the next chapter.
[56:10] Let's look for the miracle, God, that
[56:12] you want to perform in our storm.
[56:16] Thank you, Lord, for your servants.
[56:17] Thank you for brother Andrew, for
[56:18] brother Ron, Lord, for brother Tim, Lord
[56:22] Jesus, all the ministry at this church,
[56:24] the music, the deacons, the trustees. I
[56:27] pray you'd give them a double portion,
[56:28] Lord. May you just bless them, Lord, for
[56:31] their sacrifice this weekend.
[56:34] But now, Lord, we stand here and still
[56:36] in need of you. God, we come here, Lord,
[56:39] with a fresh desire to hear from heaven
[56:41] again. I pray God that you would just be
[56:44] the guest amongst us. Come and speak
[56:48] through your word, Lord. Use me, Father,
[56:51] the foolishness of preaching. It's
[56:54] foolish, Lord, because I'm I'm full of
[56:56] so many fears and doubts myself as any
[57:00] human being is. any any person, Lord,
[57:04] with faults and mistakes and failures.
[57:06] That's why you called it foolish, Lord,
[57:08] could use me, God. But you could put an
[57:11] eternal gift down in my life. And if
[57:14] we'd look beyond the human veil of flesh
[57:16] and a man,
[57:18] Lord, and you'd use a vessel this
[57:20] morning, then I just pray there'd be
[57:22] edification to the body of Christ this
[57:24] morning. Use my words, Lord, to tear the
[57:27] devil's kingdom down. Use my words to
[57:30] expose lies of the devil. Lord, may a
[57:33] soul be set free this morning. May they
[57:36] walk out of here in the liberty, Lord,
[57:38] of Jesus Christ, never to be the same
[57:40] again. Come and accomplish your purpose.
[57:43] Lord, we love you with all of our
[57:44] hearts. And the church said,
[57:48] &gt;&gt; "Amen." God bless you. Amen. If you have
[57:52] your Bible, we'll turn to the book of
[57:54] Genesis, chapter 19.
[58:05] Just want to say again how much of a
[58:08] awesome time it's been here to be here
[58:10] with you. How many believes that the
[58:13] Lord Jesus spoke to you last night in
[58:16] that service? I know he did me and did
[58:19] me a great deal of of good there hearing
[58:22] those testimonies. I told brother Ron
[58:26] got in the car last night. kind of said,
[58:27] "Brother Ron, there's one thing that's
[58:28] true. The devil hates your guts."
[58:35] But you know why? Cuz Jesus loves you.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Jesus has such a love for him. And
[58:41] that's why the target of the enemy
[58:42] comes. Amen. He can't stop the word, so
[58:45] he tries to stop the vessel. Amen. But
[58:48] we just we're thankful for what God has
[58:50] done in these meetings. And also,
[58:52] Brother Andrew, and Amen. And I just
[58:54] love servants of the Lord that just love
[58:56] God's people. Amen. Genesis chapter 19.
[59:00] I want to just minister you today. And
[59:02] I'm going to minister what the Lord told
[59:04] me before I came to these meetings. What
[59:06] I would preach this morning. Didn't know
[59:08] Friday night the Lord changed me. But
[59:10] this morning I told brother Tim this
[59:11] week a week or so ago that God had just
[59:14] come and so confirmed this. So you just
[59:16] want to say Lord let me be sensitive to
[59:19] what you want to speak. Let me have an
[59:21] ear to hear. You know, faith isn't dull
[59:24] of hearing.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; You might be, but your faith, Brother
[59:28] Brandham said, that little woman who
[59:30] touched the hymn of his garment, he said
[59:32] she had many hindrances, but her faith
[59:35] didn't have any hindrance.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and the prophet of God said it
[59:40] this way. He said, you know, that the
[59:41] Lord Jesus was God's gift to the world.
[59:44] How many believe that?
[59:46] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And the father showed his
[59:48] gift where to go, what to do, what to
[59:50] say, what to speak. He led him and
[59:52] pulled him in directions. And he said,
[59:54] "And the father had shown Jesus
[59:55] everywhere to go." And he says, "But he
[59:58] didn't show him that little woman."
[1:00:01] And the prophet says it this way. He
[1:00:03] says, "But she by her faith reached out
[1:00:08] and pulled out from God's gift what she
[1:00:11] needed in her life." That's why Jesus
[1:00:14] said, "Who touched me?" He didn't even
[1:00:16] see it coming. And the prophet says if
[1:00:18] she could do that, then you could reach
[1:00:20] out by your need. You got a burden, you
[1:00:22] got a need this morning, you could reach
[1:00:24] out by faith and operate the gift of
[1:00:26] God. Amen. And pull out from the Lord
[1:00:29] Jesus what you need. Answers to
[1:00:31] questions, heal it in your body,
[1:00:33] deliverance from sin. It's here this
[1:00:35] morning. I believe it comes with the
[1:00:37] atonement. And we've got the atonement.
[1:00:39] It's just as alive today as it was the
[1:00:41] day that the blood was shed. Amen. So,
[1:00:44] we just want to uh we want to turn our
[1:00:46] hearts now to the Lord. I want to
[1:00:48] minister to you and I'm going to give
[1:00:49] this title,
[1:00:51] the legacy of Lot.
[1:00:55] The legacy
[1:00:57] of Lot.
[1:00:59] Now, we're going to go through a storm.
[1:01:02] Going to be dark clouds,
[1:01:04] lightning, but just hold on.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; The sun will come out again.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; So, can you go with me through the
[1:01:12] storm?
[1:01:14] And there came two angels. Let's look at
[1:01:16] verse one. To Sodom at even, that's
[1:01:19] important to a believer, meaning even or
[1:01:22] evening time.
[1:01:24] Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. And Lot
[1:01:27] seeing them rose up to meet them. And he
[1:01:30] bowed himself with his face towards the
[1:01:33] ground. And he said, "Behold now, my
[1:01:35] lords, turn in, I pray you, into your
[1:01:38] servants's house, and tarry all night.
[1:01:41] wash your feet, and you shall rise up
[1:01:42] and go on your ways." They said, "Nay,
[1:01:45] but we will abide in the street all
[1:01:47] night." And he pressed upon them
[1:01:49] greatly, and they turned unto him, and
[1:01:51] entered into his house. And he made them
[1:01:54] a feast and did bake unleavened bread,
[1:01:56] and they did eat. But before they lay
[1:01:58] down, the men of the city, even the men
[1:02:00] of Sodom, compass the house roundabout.
[1:02:03] Now, notice how the Bible says this.
[1:02:06] both old and young, all the people from
[1:02:12] every quarter.
[1:02:15] The disease of Sodom had spread not just
[1:02:18] to the youth, but to the old and every
[1:02:23] quarter in the city.
[1:02:26] And they called unto Lot, and said unto
[1:02:28] him, Where are the men which came into
[1:02:30] thee this night? Bring them out unto us
[1:02:32] that we may know them. Lot went in out
[1:02:35] the door unto them and shut the door
[1:02:36] after him. And I want you to notice the
[1:02:40] condition of Lot. Now remember what a
[1:02:41] prophet taught us. Lot was a Peter said
[1:02:45] a righteous man.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; They called him he calls him just Lot.
[1:02:50] In other words, justified.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; He came out under the blessing of
[1:02:54] Abraham. And the prophet says he was a
[1:02:56] believer with a backsliden heart.
[1:03:00] But he had became such in a state of
[1:03:03] compromise that notice what he says here
[1:03:05] in the first in the next verse here and
[1:03:08] he says in verse 7 I and said I pray you
[1:03:13] brethren
[1:03:16] he's calling these men brethren
[1:03:21] do not so wickedly I think he got a part
[1:03:23] of that gospel that Moab tried to preach
[1:03:26] to the children of Israel. Hey, we're
[1:03:27] all the same and there's really no
[1:03:29] difference between you and us and you
[1:03:31] got to sacrifice and you know you
[1:03:33] believe in the in in God. Brother Madam
[1:03:35] says, "Oh, but God is the one who puts a
[1:03:37] difference in your life."
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Let me say it this way. You are not them
[1:03:42] and they are not you.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; You ought to be different cuz God
[1:03:46] separated you from Lot
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; from Sodom. Notice this, brethren.
[1:03:51] Behold now two daughters which have not
[1:03:53] known man. Let me I pray you bring them
[1:03:56] out unto you and do you so do you to
[1:03:58] them as good in your eyes only unto
[1:04:01] these men do nothing for therefore they
[1:04:03] came under the shadow of my roof and
[1:04:05] they said stand back they said again the
[1:04:06] one fellow came into sojourn and he will
[1:04:08] needs be a judge let's move on down just
[1:04:11] before you're seated to verse 25
[1:04:14] and he overthrow those cities and all
[1:04:16] the plain and all the inhabitants of the
[1:04:18] cities and that which grew upon the
[1:04:20] ground but his wife looked back from
[1:04:23] behind behind him and she became a
[1:04:27] pillar of salt. It's amazing because you
[1:04:30] know the scripture very well in Luke 17
[1:04:32] and Jesus calls back this moment and
[1:04:35] said as it was in the days of Noah
[1:04:40] where they did eat and drink until the
[1:04:43] day Noah entered the ark
[1:04:46] and in the days of Lot. And Jesus says
[1:04:49] remember Lot's wife. Now remember, no
[1:04:52] age has ever faced what you're facing
[1:04:54] today. The combination of the days of
[1:04:57] Noah and the days of Lot. But this is
[1:05:00] the age the son of man is revealed. The
[1:05:04] word made flesh, not just in a prophet,
[1:05:06] but in a body.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; How many would just have a need? You
[1:05:10] want to raise your hand and just bow
[1:05:12] your heads with me? Jesus, we feel your
[1:05:14] uncction just now. Lord
[1:05:18] God, I stand here just now and I become
[1:05:22] subservient, Lord,
[1:05:26] to your spirit that wants to speak. I
[1:05:29] pray, oh God, that you would just have
[1:05:31] your perfect way. Lord, use my words
[1:05:34] that are God's sent I believe from you
[1:05:37] and may they just bring freedom to your
[1:05:40] children. I ask it now Lord as I just
[1:05:44] set myself aside. I pray God that you
[1:05:46] would use me in Jesus name. Amen. You
[1:05:50] can be seated this morning.
[1:05:58] We preached on this on Friday night how
[1:06:00] that Abraham had left
[1:06:03] Mesopotamia. That messo meaning between
[1:06:06] Patamia. The rivers actually three
[1:06:08] rivers came out of the Eden, the Nile,
[1:06:11] the Tigris and the Euphrates River. We
[1:06:13] know those were spiritual and had all
[1:06:15] had spiritual significance. But Abraham
[1:06:18] came from between the rivers. And he
[1:06:21] came and crossed and he started his
[1:06:22] journey leaving Mesopotamia as we said
[1:06:25] on Friday, everything that he ever knew
[1:06:27] in his life. And and God had brought him
[1:06:29] out. Abraham was not a good man. And
[1:06:32] even brother Brandham says this here in
[1:06:33] in the patriarch Abraham and says
[1:06:35] Abraham was not a righteous not a now
[1:06:37] he's called a the seed of faith but he
[1:06:39] didn't start out that way. In fact
[1:06:40] Isaiah 43 says that God delivered him
[1:06:43] from the pit. He was just like anybody
[1:06:46] else that was delivered from the pit. I
[1:06:50] know the Jews would love you to believe
[1:06:51] it was because of his faith, but it
[1:06:53] didn't start out that way. In fact,
[1:06:55] Abram wasn't even fully obedient to God
[1:06:58] when God told him to leave. Because what
[1:07:01] was going to give Abram the most trouble
[1:07:03] in his journey was not actually being
[1:07:06] obedient, but it was what he brought
[1:07:08] with him when God said, "Separate
[1:07:11] yourself." He brings his family. I'm I'm
[1:07:14] sorry, his father. And God didn't tell
[1:07:15] him to do that. God said, "Separate
[1:07:17] yourself." So, he doesn't start as an
[1:07:20] overcomer. He doesn't start fully
[1:07:22] obedient to the word. In fact, it was
[1:07:24] his father who would give him most of
[1:07:26] the trouble in his journey and and cause
[1:07:29] him the most distraction from getting to
[1:07:32] the promises of God. Listen friends, I
[1:07:34] hope you realize it will not be uh you
[1:07:36] know what will be your most trouble is
[1:07:38] not your brother. It's not your sister.
[1:07:41] It's not your pastor. It's not the
[1:07:42] deacon. It'll be you. Brother Brandham
[1:07:45] says, "I looked in the mirror and
[1:07:46] realized my number one enemy is Bill
[1:07:48] Brham.
[1:07:50] A and this was this is what gives us
[1:07:52] most of our trouble in our life. It's
[1:07:53] it's our own human makeup of who we are
[1:07:56] born with and the character traits that
[1:07:58] we have and the things that are passed
[1:08:00] down from one generation to the next
[1:08:02] generation. How many knows that brother
[1:08:04] Brandham said that we all come from the
[1:08:06] grabag of life and out of that grabag
[1:08:08] you get many things that you didn't
[1:08:10] choose, you didn't sign up for, you
[1:08:12] didn't get to pick. Listen, when you
[1:08:14] were born and God, you know, came into
[1:08:15] this earth, I don't know about you, but
[1:08:17] I didn't get to, you know, do that
[1:08:18] create your own player kind of thing. I
[1:08:20] didn't choose what size I'd be, what
[1:08:22] height I'd be, what color skin I'd have,
[1:08:25] what color hair I'd have. Did you get
[1:08:28] that choice, somebody? That's not fair.
[1:08:29] If I, Brother Joe, you didn't get that
[1:08:31] choice, did you?
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Digging to choose how tall you were, how
[1:08:34] much you weighed. I guarantee you, we
[1:08:36] depicted a lot different than how how we
[1:08:39] see ourselves.
[1:08:41] But God created us in a certain way. Let
[1:08:45] me say it further. Put us in a certain
[1:08:47] family. Knew the home we'd grow up in.
[1:08:49] Knew the church we'd be a Listen, you
[1:08:51] can't fit in other churches. That don't
[1:08:53] make your church right and my church
[1:08:55] wrong. God just called you to be in a
[1:08:58] different uh uh place uh geographically,
[1:09:01] nationally. You may not be in America
[1:09:03] and and you may God may have called you
[1:09:05] to be somewhere else. Uh, we're not
[1:09:07] trying to be somebody or try to be
[1:09:09] somebody else or try to match me with
[1:09:11] match and I match you and you match me.
[1:09:13] Listen friends, God just wants you to be
[1:09:15] who you are because you have challenges
[1:09:18] you'll face that I don't have. Thank God
[1:09:20] you don't have to deal with the Watkins
[1:09:22] traits that I have to deal with. But
[1:09:24] thank God I don't have to deal with your
[1:09:25] traits either cuz God didn't call me to
[1:09:27] it. You see, David could not slay
[1:09:30] Goliath with another man's slingshot. He
[1:09:33] had to use what God put in his hands.
[1:09:36] And God is saying, "I've made you a
[1:09:38] certain way. You've got certain traits
[1:09:39] you've got got to overcome. And all you
[1:09:41] got to do is surrender those human
[1:09:44] traits and take on the new traits of
[1:09:47] your earthly father. I'm not an
[1:09:49] American. I'm not a can can. You're not
[1:09:51] a Canadian. You're not a a Belgium.
[1:09:53] You're not a European." Uh listen
[1:09:54] friends, we're not identified by the
[1:09:56] country a a citizen. I'm glad I'm born
[1:10:00] in the South. I was going to tell you,
[1:10:01] praise God. God, I wasn't born in the
[1:10:03] north. Nothing against you northerners,
[1:10:04] but it's just the way life. But I
[1:10:06] realized a long time ago, I'm not a
[1:10:08] northerner, a southerner, an eastern, a
[1:10:10] westerner, Republican, Democrat. I'm a
[1:10:13] child of God. And my identity is found
[1:10:16] in my birthplace, which is the word of
[1:10:19] God.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; And Abram's most of his trouble would
[1:10:25] come from his own daddy. And brother
[1:10:27] Brandham sees it this way. You notice in
[1:10:29] paradox when the man comes to brother
[1:10:31] Brandham, it's actually his family and
[1:10:33] they father mother and father father
[1:10:34] says mother father says we want to know
[1:10:36] what's wrong with our son. is a good boy
[1:10:38] raised in church, you know, uh we raised
[1:10:40] him, right? He was baptized and and you
[1:10:42] know, good name among brother Brandon
[1:10:44] says, "Well, I don't doubt any of those
[1:10:45] things." He says, "I'm not saying he
[1:10:47] wasn't but you know, baptized. I'm not
[1:10:49] saying he's not a Christian in name."
[1:10:51] And he says, "But but but until his life
[1:10:54] copes with his testimony
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; and he says, see, you saying you've got
[1:10:59] the Holy Ghost and you having it is
[1:11:00] alltogether different."
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; And the father and mother say, "What's
[1:11:04] wrong with our boy?" Notice
[1:11:07] brother Vanam immediately goes to his
[1:11:08] mother says, "Now look at you. Your your
[1:11:10] family is Germans. Nothing against the
[1:11:13] Germans."
[1:11:17] They just shut me off the live stream
[1:11:19] right there. Hold on. And he says,
[1:11:22] "Notice they're Germans. Very
[1:11:24] independent, irreverent towards
[1:11:25] religion.
[1:11:27] Many a fine morning." He says, "I go
[1:11:28] down to see your mother. There she is in
[1:11:30] the yard and walk down the road." And he
[1:11:32] says, "I I I look at her and say, "Good
[1:11:34] morning, ma'am." She just sit there and
[1:11:37] stare at me.
[1:11:40] She a fine morning,
[1:11:45] Brother says, "Intelligent woman.
[1:11:47] Nothing wrong with her." And he says,
[1:11:48] "But very independent, you know." He
[1:11:50] says, "Uh, sure. Fine morning. Good to
[1:11:52] see you this morning." He said, "She
[1:11:53] just sit there and stare at me." A lot
[1:11:54] like a lot of people do at church when
[1:11:55] I'm preaching to them. No matter what
[1:11:57] you say, man, they just have that stare.
[1:12:02] Amen.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; And he says, but notice, he says,
[1:12:06] intelligent woman, very irreependent
[1:12:08] nature. And then he talks about the
[1:12:10] father. And he says, notice you, all of
[1:12:12] this is brother Brandon's own family. He
[1:12:13] says, you know, all your families are
[1:12:15] fighters and alcoholics and drunks. And
[1:12:17] and he says, you know, Brandham's died
[1:12:19] with their boots on there. He says,
[1:12:20] that's part of your your human makeup.
[1:12:23] It's part of that human nature. It's
[1:12:25] part of that real enemy that you really
[1:12:28] got.
[1:12:29] And he says all of them, he says,
[1:12:30] "Fighters, hightempered, highrung,
[1:12:32] Irish, uh, moody, temperamental." I know
[1:12:35] y'all ain't got nobody like that in this
[1:12:36] church, so I just preach to those in
[1:12:38] South Carolina. High-tempered, moody,
[1:12:40] highrung,
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; just fly off the handle at anything.
[1:12:45] And then somehow, amazingly, we get the
[1:12:47] Holy Ghost and we think, well, that's
[1:12:48] just who I am. I mean, I I know I got
[1:12:50] the Holy Ghost, but that's just how
[1:12:51] that's just my family. That's just my
[1:12:53] That might be what your testimony is,
[1:12:55] but my testimony is the blood of Jesus
[1:12:58] overcomes my human strains, my human
[1:13:00] complexes, my family heritage. Listen
[1:13:03] friends, the blood of Jesus erases that
[1:13:06] and you come, as the Bible said, a new
[1:13:09] creature in Christ Jesus.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; And notice he says, "But look at you."
[1:13:16] Notice it's incredible because the
[1:13:19] mystery of the boy laid in the mother
[1:13:23] and the father.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon never even mentions the
[1:13:28] boy. He talks about the mother and the
[1:13:31] father and the human traits that were
[1:13:35] affecting that boy.
[1:13:38] I think if we'd catch a revelation, we
[1:13:40] would realize that most of our problems
[1:13:43] come because we make excuses
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; because that's just how I am. That's
[1:13:48] just how I was raised. And you know, but
[1:13:50] that's just how I'll always be. And my
[1:13:52] family was that way. That's just how
[1:13:53] I'll be. And my daddy was that way. And
[1:13:55] that's how I'll be. And my mama was that
[1:13:57] just in my family. You know, I'm just
[1:13:58] different than you. And and God's just
[1:14:00] going to wink at those things, you know,
[1:14:01] and just be be okay with that temper and
[1:14:04] be okay with that jealousy and be okay
[1:14:06] with that lust and be okay with, you
[1:14:07] know, God's not okay with any of it. I'm
[1:14:09] just preaching here.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; And and and many of those things, the
[1:14:15] mystery. But notice, he says, "But look
[1:14:17] at you, mama." And he says, "You are the
[1:14:19] only one out of all your sisters."
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And you're not that way."
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And look at you, daddy.
[1:14:26] Out of all of your family." And he says,
[1:14:28] "All of them drunk and he but you're not
[1:14:31] that way."
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; And brother, I love how he says this in
[1:14:34] paradox. He says, "What does that
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; and he says, you're the only one out of
[1:14:42] all your family and you've received the
[1:14:44] Lord Jesus in your life." And then he
[1:14:47] says, "You notice it's not your people
[1:14:50] anymore. It's your Christ living down on
[1:14:54] the inside of you." you. Oh my brother,
[1:14:56] I want to have that kind of testimony to
[1:14:58] say it's not my family. It's not my
[1:15:01] family complexes or my family strains.
[1:15:04] It's my Christ living on the inside of
[1:15:06] me. I am a new creature in Christ Jesus.
[1:15:10] All things are passed away.
[1:15:13] Prophet of God looks there and he's
[1:15:14] thinking about his own life. He's
[1:15:16] thinking about a little boy and he says,
[1:15:17] "There I was on the riverbank just as a
[1:15:20] little nine-year-old boy." He says, "I
[1:15:22] always grew up that way. Nobody really
[1:15:24] loved me." in school. He said, "I people
[1:15:26] thought I was odd. Didn't have no
[1:15:28] friends." And he says, "Mom and daddy
[1:15:30] were drunks and party. They party in
[1:15:32] there and music real loud." And he says,
[1:15:34] "I I never found anybody that loved me
[1:15:36] until I met the Lord Jesus."
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; He said, "And I found somebody who
[1:15:42] really loved me for my worth, for who I
[1:15:44] am." And he says, "There I was on the
[1:15:46] river bank there, eight, nine years
[1:15:47] old." And he says, "Laying there," he
[1:15:49] says, "Just watching, waiting for the
[1:15:51] party to end. Mom and daddy there." He
[1:15:53] says, "I was up on there in the in the
[1:15:55] in the winter time." And he says, "Real
[1:15:56] cold." Imagine a 9-year-old boy and his
[1:15:59] mother and father drinking like that.
[1:16:01] And and and and and brother Bam not
[1:16:03] wanting to be around that. And and and
[1:16:06] he's there and he's there at the river
[1:16:08] there at the creek and he's just fishing
[1:16:10] and he's fishing as his dog there. And
[1:16:12] brother Bam's just contemplating this in
[1:16:14] the winter time there in the summertime
[1:16:15] and and here's the summer and he's there
[1:16:17] and and he has his dog and his fishing
[1:16:20] pole and and he says he's just sitting
[1:16:22] there and he says you know he says I I'd
[1:16:25] been there in the winter and I'd built a
[1:16:27] fire there to stay warm and till I could
[1:16:29] go home
[1:16:31] and he says there I was and looking
[1:16:33] around. He says, "I I I noticed a little
[1:16:36] flower coming up just here." And he
[1:16:39] says, "I thought, hey,
[1:16:41] how'd you get there? You you you
[1:16:44] shouldn't be there."
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; And he says, "I was just here last year
[1:16:49] and the snow covered you over." And he
[1:16:52] says, "And the frost covered you over."
[1:16:55] And he says, "And worse than that, I
[1:16:57] built a fire over top of you."
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; And he says, "But somehow you're here.
[1:17:04] and you're blooming and you're
[1:17:06] blossoming. The prophet of God suddenly
[1:17:08] something strikes his heart and he
[1:17:10] realizes he's that little flower and the
[1:17:12] devil tried to throw everything at him.
[1:17:14] Tried to give every give him the kitchen
[1:17:16] sink. Listen to me, brother Ron. The
[1:17:18] devil has thrown everything at you. But
[1:17:20] in spite of it all, against all odds,
[1:17:24] against all odds, you're here this
[1:17:26] morning. Oh, come on, somebody. There's
[1:17:28] only one reason you believe it and stand
[1:17:31] for the message of the hour. It's the
[1:17:33] grace of almighty God has been real to
[1:17:36] your life.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; And in spite of everything the devil's
[1:17:41] thrown your way, here you are.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Let me just say it this way. In spite of
[1:17:46] everyone walking away from this message,
[1:17:48] here you are with the faith in your
[1:17:50] heart to believe it with all that's
[1:17:54] within you. Prophet of God said, "I
[1:17:56] heard a voice at that moment and it
[1:17:59] said, you are not the son of Charles and
[1:18:04] Helbrom."
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; What was it? He was hearing from his
[1:18:09] theophony
[1:18:11] who he really was in the back part of
[1:18:15] God's mind before life ever began.
[1:18:19] Abraham
[1:18:22] comes out this way and it's incredible
[1:18:25] because this is the trouble that he has
[1:18:28] and he goes and as we preached on Friday
[1:18:30] he passes that test and he moves on past
[1:18:33] that and then he continues his journey.
[1:18:36] We just want to pick it up here just for
[1:18:37] a moment and he's brings his nephew Lot.
[1:18:43] He brings his nephew Lot with him. You
[1:18:46] know, Lot is one of the most striking
[1:18:48] contrast in the Bible. Who's a man who
[1:18:52] began his journey living literally under
[1:18:54] the shadow of one of the greatest men in
[1:18:56] history, one of the greatest men in the
[1:18:58] Bible. And he begins his journey with
[1:19:01] Lot, with Abraham. He's very blessed
[1:19:03] because of that. He began his journey
[1:19:05] journeying with him beside him. This is
[1:19:07] a man who is called the friend of God. I
[1:19:10] don't want to be around those kind of
[1:19:11] friends.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; He's a friend of God. a man who has the
[1:19:14] blessing of God upon his life.
[1:19:18] And yet somehow Lot's legacy, how his
[1:19:23] story begins
[1:19:25] is also different how it ends.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; He ends that story in a cave,
[1:19:32] stripped of nearly everything
[1:19:35] except the mercy that pulled him out of
[1:19:37] Sodom.
[1:19:40] And there he is and his life leaves
[1:19:42] behind such a haunting legacy. I'm
[1:19:46] preaching to you this morning on the
[1:19:48] legacy of Lot. Now, I just want to say
[1:19:50] this here this morning. When you hear
[1:19:52] the word legacy, don't think of legacy
[1:19:54] as the world defines it as some type
[1:19:56] even the denominations use those word
[1:19:58] legacy. And I'm not necessarily
[1:19:59] preaching against that, but that's not
[1:20:01] what I'm preaching on today. Legacy is
[1:20:02] is more. In fact, the Bible doesn't even
[1:20:05] use the word legacy, but it uses a
[1:20:07] different word, inheritance. That a
[1:20:09] godly man will leave an inheritance to
[1:20:12] his children and his children's
[1:20:14] children. But it's not talking about an
[1:20:16] earthly monetary house or car or
[1:20:19] business or those kind of things. But it
[1:20:21] actually is talking about a spiritual
[1:20:23] legacy
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; that has left a mark on generation after
[1:20:29] generation after generation. Long,
[1:20:31] Brother Brandham says, after that man's
[1:20:33] gone, your life will carry an influence.
[1:20:36] Your voice that you speak now, the
[1:20:38] prophet said, circles the earth and it
[1:20:41] never dies.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; And so the legacy that that that we're
[1:20:46] talking about today is a spiritual
[1:20:48] legacy. One that a father leaves, a
[1:20:51] grandfather leaves, and he's a pillar to
[1:20:53] that family, a pillar to that home. And
[1:20:56] he's and he and it's it's it's what
[1:20:58] they're leaving their mark that they
[1:21:00] make on the future. Their mark, the
[1:21:03] imprint that they leave behind. Prophet
[1:21:06] of God says it that way in influence.
[1:21:08] You're leaving, you're influencing, your
[1:21:10] life is influencing somebody.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, sisters. Your younger
[1:21:17] sister is watching you.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Come on, older brothers. I I just feel
[1:21:25] this from the Lord. This is fresh on my
[1:21:26] heart. Your little brother's watching
[1:21:29] your life
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; and you don't realize the decisions you
[1:21:33] make and what compromises you allow in
[1:21:36] your life. That younger person will take
[1:21:38] it 10 times further than you did. Come
[1:21:40] on, mama. Your children are watching
[1:21:42] you. They're watching your standard.
[1:21:44] They're watching how you dress. They're
[1:21:46] watching how you deal with sin, what you
[1:21:48] allow, what you don't allow. Uh I'm just
[1:21:50] going to go and preach on it, daddies.
[1:21:52] They're watching what you allow to come
[1:21:53] across that screen on your TV or your
[1:21:56] whatever you want to call smartphone or
[1:21:57] a monitor, whatever you want to call it,
[1:21:59] computer monitor.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; They're watching what you allow on that
[1:22:02] house.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; They're watching. They're depending upon
[1:22:05] a man who will stand for the word of
[1:22:08] God.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; And take a stand in spite of what it
[1:22:11] looks like or how popular or unpopular
[1:22:14] it is.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Listen, children will follow the example
[1:22:18] that's set before them.
[1:22:21] They're looking for someone to be
[1:22:23] strong,
[1:22:24] not a lot, wishy-washy compromiser.
[1:22:28] Prophet of God said that the he he was a
[1:22:31] backsliden believer. He's a man who who
[1:22:34] the the Bible says that the sins of
[1:22:36] Sodom vexed his righteous soul. The word
[1:22:39] vex is as the Greek word there is is to
[1:22:43] be worn down.
[1:22:46] It wore him down to live in that
[1:22:49] compromised state where he was a
[1:22:51] compromiser with the word of God. Didn't
[1:22:53] know where he stood. Was a jellyfish.
[1:22:55] The prophet of God said it this way. He
[1:22:57] says, "The sins of Sodom bothered him,
[1:22:59] but he didn't have the downright
[1:23:00] gumption
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; to say something about it."
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Do you realize it is most of the time
[1:23:08] for Lot, it wasn't just one choice he
[1:23:10] made, but it was his weak position.
[1:23:15] on everything that he could never be
[1:23:17] strong on what he believed
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; and and and and and he goes here and I
[1:23:23] just feel in the inspiration I'm not
[1:23:25] following my notes at all and that's
[1:23:26] when I feel the best
[1:23:29] but he's a compromiser he doesn't he he
[1:23:32] he doesn't know where he stands he
[1:23:34] doesn't know what he believes he's sort
[1:23:36] of wishy-washy in and out and the
[1:23:39] example that he's that he's leaving
[1:23:41] behind the legacy of what he's leaving
[1:23:43] behind the imprint that he's leaving
[1:23:45] behind. What he's trans what he's
[1:23:47] transmitting to his family. Oh my
[1:23:51] brother, let me just preach it to you
[1:23:52] and say I don't want that. There will be
[1:23:54] nothing worse than getting to heaven
[1:23:56] when getting if you go by the way of the
[1:23:59] the grave and you go to hell, there will
[1:24:01] be hell will be bad. Let me tell you
[1:24:02] right now, hell will be a horrible
[1:24:04] place.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; It's where the that's where there's no
[1:24:07] God. Brother man said there and when he
[1:24:08] falls down and he's feel like he's
[1:24:10] falling, he said the worst part was
[1:24:11] there was no God there.
[1:24:14] You know, you know what? You know what
[1:24:15] the worst part about one of the worst
[1:24:17] parts about heaven? I'm sorry about
[1:24:18] hell. One of the worst parts about hell
[1:24:20] is what won't be there.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; There won't be no preacher to try to
[1:24:24] preach to you. There won't be no mother
[1:24:26] to pray for you. There won't be no God
[1:24:28] there. The presence of God will be void
[1:24:30] from that place. It will be what's
[1:24:32] absent.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; You know what the worst part? I couldn't
[1:24:36] imagine. You say, "Is there something
[1:24:38] worse than going to hell?" Yes, there's
[1:24:41] something worse than going to hell.
[1:24:46] Think about your life. Think about your
[1:24:48] children. Think about your uncle, your
[1:24:50] aunt, your cousin, your brother, your
[1:24:51] sister.
[1:24:53] You imagine what would be worse than
[1:24:56] going to hell. Something worse than
[1:24:58] going to hell. Brother Ron, it'll be
[1:25:01] those that go with me.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; And I had the moment. I had the chance
[1:25:06] to change their life,
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; to point them in a different direction,
[1:25:10] but they followed my footsteps of
[1:25:12] compromise and watered down. You know,
[1:25:15] half of I half, you know, kind of never
[1:25:17] really a man to take a stand, but now,
[1:25:19] you know, daddy believed the message,
[1:25:21] but really he didn't really live it.
[1:25:23] That's not a testimony you should ever
[1:25:24] have.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; You know, my daddy believed the message
[1:25:28] all his heart, but he allowed this kind
[1:25:29] of compromise. I couldn't imagine
[1:25:31] nothing. There's nothing worse than
[1:25:33] going to hell will be the what's worse
[1:25:35] than is those who have followed me,
[1:25:36] those who have been influenced by my
[1:25:38] life and now I've got to live under the
[1:25:40] condemnation daily uh every moment
[1:25:42] thinking how I all of the people that
[1:25:45] have followed me to this place. Couldn't
[1:25:47] imagine my brother, my sister, but there
[1:25:49] is something worse than going to hell.
[1:25:51] But can I just say heaven's going to be
[1:25:53] awesome, brother Ron? I'm going to be on
[1:25:55] the streets of gold, but there's
[1:25:56] something better than going to heaven.
[1:25:58] You say, "Brother Matt, how could heaven
[1:26:00] be better?" I tell you what will be
[1:26:02] better than going to heaven. It will be
[1:26:04] my family. It will be my children. It
[1:26:06] will be my sons and my daughters and my
[1:26:09] family that I love. It will be who will
[1:26:12] be there with me. Hallelujah.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; I just want to say it as I feel it.
[1:26:22] Inspiration of the Holy Ghost. I'm I'm
[1:26:25] not old. Let me just make that clear
[1:26:26] right now. I am 42. I think something
[1:26:29] like that now. And and let me just say
[1:26:31] this. There's there comes a point in
[1:26:33] your life. You're young and you're
[1:26:34] married and you have family and you have
[1:26:36] ambitions. You have dreams and all the
[1:26:38] things you want to do and all the things
[1:26:39] you're going to be and the kind of house
[1:26:41] you're going to build and and we did
[1:26:42] that. We went through all of that. What
[1:26:43] kind of car you're going to drive and
[1:26:45] and you know, you got all these dreams
[1:26:46] and aspirations as a man for his family
[1:26:50] and you you're young and you're married
[1:26:52] and and and and and I was at that point.
[1:26:54] I'm still young and I'm still married.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Make that clear.
[1:27:00] But can I just say this? Something
[1:27:03] changed in my life.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; And I just want to say it to you the way
[1:27:08] I feel it from the core of my being. I I
[1:27:11] I'm thankful. I'm so thankful for all
[1:27:14] God has given me. I'm so thankful for
[1:27:16] the blessings he's poured upon my life.
[1:27:18] I'm so thankful for my house. I'm
[1:27:20] thankful for my cars. I'm thankful for
[1:27:22] my health. I'm thankful for all those
[1:27:24] things. But can I say that for my life,
[1:27:26] it is a very narrow goal. As David said,
[1:27:29] one thing have I desired in this life.
[1:27:32] And can I make it real simple? It's that
[1:27:34] my children walk in truth, serve the
[1:27:37] Lord, have the baptism of the Holy
[1:27:40] Ghost. There is nothing more important
[1:27:42] in your life.
[1:27:47] Oh, hallelujah. I say, God, do whatever
[1:27:50] you got to do to me. The Bible says, "No
[1:27:53] greater joy that I have than my children
[1:27:56] walk in truth."
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Make the rapture and let my children go
[1:28:00] with me.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; It's my greatest desire. You might want
[1:28:08] a lot of other things. That's all I
[1:28:10] want.
[1:28:20] What was it in Lot as a compromiser?
[1:28:25] He was Lot Abraham's nephew. His father
[1:28:27] died Abraham took him under his wings.
[1:28:29] They left their homeland. When God
[1:28:31] called Abraham to a new country, Lot
[1:28:32] walked in the light that shined from
[1:28:34] Abraham's faith. And because of that
[1:28:36] connection, he was blessed. His flocks
[1:28:38] grew, his herds grew, and multiplied.
[1:28:41] Prosperity followed. It came to such a
[1:28:44] place to where they they they they they
[1:28:45] they they had to separate themselves.
[1:28:48] Strife breaks out between his herdsmen
[1:28:50] and the cattle and and so Abraham's got
[1:28:52] to make a choice here and he gives he
[1:28:54] gives Lot the choice of the land. Gives
[1:28:56] him the choice and the scripture says
[1:28:59] Lot lifted up his eyes
[1:29:03] and he seen the well-watered plains of
[1:29:06] Jordan.
[1:29:07] He seen the wellwatered plains of
[1:29:11] Jordan. He lifted up his eyes. It was
[1:29:14] fertile. It was green. And here's
[1:29:17] Abraham and it's dusty and it's dirty
[1:29:20] and it's tent dwelling and tent living.
[1:29:22] It's poor. It's a hard life.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; And he looks at Sodom and he sees the
[1:29:28] well. He looks at Jordan and sees the
[1:29:29] well-watered plains of Jordan. It looked
[1:29:31] naturally to the natural light. It
[1:29:33] looked good. It looked pleasant. It was
[1:29:36] one for a tree to be desired. Come on,
[1:29:38] somebody.
[1:29:39] had good fruit on it. It looks good to
[1:29:42] him. And and he he looks there, but what
[1:29:44] he failed to see was a path from Jordan
[1:29:47] that led to Sodom. Prophet of God said
[1:29:50] he seen the wellwater plains of Jordan,
[1:29:52] but he didn't see the defilement of his
[1:29:54] daughters.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; He didn't see the destruction of his
[1:29:59] whole home. Prophet of God says in
[1:30:00] another place, Sarah, I'm sorry, uh uh
[1:30:03] Lot's wife, brother Mam says, Lot's wife
[1:30:06] started as an overcomer. Yes.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; But she just followed her husband's
[1:30:12] lead.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; A man who could never really take a
[1:30:16] stand for what's true.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Thank God for men of God in my life that
[1:30:21] were not jellyfish. They knew what they
[1:30:24] were standing upon. They knew what they
[1:30:26] believed. They spoke it. You ought to
[1:30:28] thank God for a pastor who will speak
[1:30:30] the truth.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; She became a memorial of salt. Yeah,
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; she became a a memorial. Brother Brandon
[1:30:39] preaches that in memorials, time tested
[1:30:40] memorials. She became a picture, a
[1:30:42] portrait of compromise of s a memorial.
[1:30:45] Oh, but there was another memorial.
[1:30:47] There was a memorial in Joshua 4 where
[1:30:49] the priests, the Bible says that they go
[1:30:51] across Jordan. I love how the Bible
[1:30:53] writes that and it says that they stood
[1:30:55] up, they they they he says they go into
[1:30:57] the Jordan and they place their feet,
[1:30:58] those priests stand there with their
[1:31:00] feet in the waters of Jordan. This is
[1:31:03] what your Bible says. And the I love how
[1:31:05] the scripture says this because it says
[1:31:07] it says that after they're there as the
[1:31:10] priests walk into Jordan, notice what is
[1:31:12] Jordan represent? Sin. It represents
[1:31:15] death, right?
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; And so the the the these men of God had
[1:31:20] to put their foot. It's very different
[1:31:22] than than when Moses crosses the Red
[1:31:24] Sea. Now with Moses, it's a prophet and
[1:31:26] it's a, you know, almost you could say a
[1:31:27] dramatic picture, very dramatic with the
[1:31:30] staff in his hand and and he places his
[1:31:33] staff there and the David said the water
[1:31:35] stood up.
[1:31:38] It's like a big, you know, Hollywood
[1:31:40] film, you know, just a dramatic moment
[1:31:44] under a prophet.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Somebody help me preach.
[1:31:50] But now they're at Jordan under Joshua.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; And Joshua doesn't call a prophet. He
[1:31:56] calls priests, one out of every tribe,
[1:31:58] men of God from the Levitical
[1:31:59] priesthood. And they come and God says,
[1:32:02] "You're going to have to cross a Jordan,
[1:32:03] too. You're going to have to cross
[1:32:05] death, too."
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; And he says, "But it will be he'll be
[1:32:08] the priest." And he says, "When their
[1:32:10] foot touches the Jordan," now not when
[1:32:13] they thought about it.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; It's one thing to think about it. But
[1:32:18] you've got to place your foot in Jordan.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; And as they place their foot, Jordan
[1:32:25] parts a little bit.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; And here's Manasseh tribe representing
[1:32:29] Levi. And he places his foot. And then
[1:32:31] Gad, then Reuben, then Benjamin. And all
[1:32:33] of these men come and take their spot.
[1:32:36] And as they stand there, notice this,
[1:32:39] Jordan begins to part just a little bit.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; And now before you know it, there's a
[1:32:45] highway going through the middle of
[1:32:46] Jordan. And the families begin to walk
[1:32:49] through on dry ground.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; It's incredible because there's a
[1:32:53] memorial of stones there that God says,
[1:32:55] "Go and take the stones from where the
[1:32:57] priest beast stood firm, 12 stones." And
[1:33:00] he makes like like Lot's wife becomes a
[1:33:02] memorial. He makes a memorial and he
[1:33:05] says, "Let this memorial speak to your
[1:33:07] children
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; when your children begin to ask
[1:33:11] fathers." Oh, can you hear the words of
[1:33:13] Malachi? When the children begin to ask
[1:33:16] fathers, the faith of the children will
[1:33:19] be turned back to the faith of fathers.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; And it will be these stones, these
[1:33:24] divinely revealed mystery truths will
[1:33:26] literally turn the hearts of the
[1:33:28] children back to the faith of the
[1:33:30] Pentecostal apostolic fathers.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; And he takes 12 men. Come here, guys.
[1:33:37] Give me six guys. Stand right here. I
[1:33:38] want you to I want you to Three of you
[1:33:40] to face this way. Three of you to face
[1:33:42] this this way. Come on, brothers. Come
[1:33:43] quick. Come quick. right there. Just
[1:33:44] face you. Face the three of you. Face
[1:33:46] that clock right there. Three of you
[1:33:48] face them. Just stand right in front of
[1:33:49] them. Let's make a prayer line right
[1:33:51] here. I need one more brave person.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice because these men
[1:33:56] are going to represent something.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; These men, listen to me, brother. Let me
[1:34:00] just say this to you today. It will be
[1:34:03] their stand, their firm stand, not a
[1:34:06] jellyfish, not a compromiser, not a, you
[1:34:09] know, not just somebody sort of halfway,
[1:34:10] don't really know what they believe,
[1:34:12] suspicious about things. As brother
[1:34:13] Brandham said, God will never use a man
[1:34:15] like that.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said in patriarch
[1:34:17] Abraham, he said, "If you're suspicious
[1:34:19] about believing and you got questions,"
[1:34:20] he said, "I wouldn't even come up here
[1:34:22] in fool with an altar. I wouldn't even
[1:34:23] come through a prayer line if you got
[1:34:25] doubt in your heart.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Get to the place where you can believe
[1:34:28] it.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Then God will do something for you."
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; And these men are going to stand upon.
[1:34:34] So, I want you to notice these men of
[1:34:37] God are going to go through things
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; that you may never have to go through in
[1:34:43] your life.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; They will face doubt and discouragement.
[1:34:49] They'll go through sickness. They'll go
[1:34:50] through sorrow. They'll go through loss.
[1:34:54] You ought to pray for the men of God in
[1:34:57] your life and the pastors. God has sent
[1:34:59] you and your life to lead you and take a
[1:35:02] spiritual hand of faith and hold the
[1:35:04] sword of the word of God and stand
[1:35:06] against the demonic realms of darkness
[1:35:09] trying to trying to destroy your home
[1:35:11] and destroy your family and destroy your
[1:35:14] children. But thank God for a man who
[1:35:16] will say Satan, you have come thus far
[1:35:18] and thus far you will go no further.
[1:35:27] It will be these men who their stand on
[1:35:30] the word of God. The children of Israel
[1:35:32] will pass through. They will pass
[1:35:34] through the water. They will pass
[1:35:35] through on dry land because a priest is
[1:35:37] standing in his position.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; But I ask you, what would happen? What
[1:35:48] would happen if this brother's trial got
[1:35:50] him so down? Didn't have nobody to talk
[1:35:54] to. He was so discouraged.
[1:35:56] Little church ain't got many people.
[1:35:58] Can't hardly get nobody to come on a
[1:36:00] Wednesday night. Having to work a job,
[1:36:02] try to be a pastor. Listen, some of
[1:36:03] these men of God go through things that
[1:36:06] the I tell you what, they go through
[1:36:07] some of the hottest battles, things
[1:36:09] you'll never understand.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; But what if he let his circumstance,
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; his own Listen, you think that your
[1:36:16] pastor doesn't have trials just like
[1:36:19] you've got trials? You think your
[1:36:21] pastor's family, his children will be
[1:36:24] attacked in a way your children are
[1:36:25] never attacked.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; They'll live under the pressure that you
[1:36:29] have no way to identify with.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; And now he lets his pain push him out of
[1:36:34] Jordan. Just stand there, brother. Stand
[1:36:36] there.
[1:36:38] What if this man over here gets bitter
[1:36:41] in his heart? Bitterness over somebody
[1:36:44] talked about him. Somebody said
[1:36:45] something about him. He says it online
[1:36:47] and then his entire ministry is you know
[1:36:50] questioned put into question and that
[1:36:51] thought begins to work through his mind
[1:36:54] and just thinks I just I just I just I
[1:36:56] just won't preach anymore and he steps
[1:36:58] out of the Jordan.
[1:37:00] What about this man if he starts saying,
[1:37:02] you know, we really don't have to quote
[1:37:04] a prophet anymore?
[1:37:07] You know, it's just we don't have to say
[1:37:09] brother Brandon said and brother Brandon
[1:37:10] said and brother Brandon said and
[1:37:11] brother Brandon said. Why we got to say
[1:37:13] that?
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Why can't we? You know, they have a
[1:37:15] problem talking about saying the Apostle
[1:37:16] Paul said. Don't have a problem saying
[1:37:18] the Apostle Peter said. Don't have a
[1:37:19] problem saying John Wesley said. Don't
[1:37:20] have a problem saying Spurgeon said,
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; but somehow the problem is saying
[1:37:24] brother Brandham said.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Tell you what, that's a spirit.
[1:37:30] And I ain't against the men. I'm against
[1:37:32] the devil. I hate his guts. He's my
[1:37:35] enemy. And I want to say I resist that
[1:37:37] devil with all that's in my heart.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, we ain't got to we ain't got to
[1:37:47] quote a prophet anymore. I ain't got to
[1:37:49] quote a prophet anymore. Don't you know
[1:37:51] that, brother Matt? That's what he told
[1:37:52] me. Brother Matt, come on. We ain't got
[1:37:53] to We got to keep saying, "Brother
[1:37:54] Brandon said, and brother Brandham said,
[1:37:56] and brother Brandham said, I mean, come
[1:37:56] on. Paul's, you know, aren't you not
[1:37:58] carnal?" One of apostles, one of Paul.
[1:38:00] And you know, why can't we just say
[1:38:01] Jesus said? Why can't we just go back to
[1:38:02] the B? Why can't we just go back to
[1:38:04] Jesus? Well, I got a good question.
[1:38:05] Which Jesus do you want?
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Paul said, I fear that you preach
[1:38:09] another Jesus. Preach another gospel,
[1:38:11] one who we didn't preach.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; There's only one thing and gospel that
[1:38:15] will keep Jordan and sin out of your
[1:38:17] family.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, we don't need to quote brother
[1:38:21] Brandham. Isn't that funny? Sorry,
[1:38:23] brother, to have you standing. Let me
[1:38:24] preach here for a moment. Isn't it funny
[1:38:26] they say don't quote brother Brandham
[1:38:28] yet? Yeah, they don't quote a prophet.
[1:38:30] Yet, I go in my Bible and I read that
[1:38:32] John the Baptist quoted a prophet.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; I find that Jesus quoted prophets
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; for it that it might be fulfilled the
[1:38:40] word spoken by Isaiah the prophet that
[1:38:42] it might be fulfilled the word spoken by
[1:38:44] Isa by Hezekiah uh by Jeremiah the
[1:38:47] prophet that it might be fulfilled the
[1:38:48] word spoken by Malachi the prophet.
[1:38:51] Jesus quoted prophets. Paul quoted
[1:38:53] prophets. John quot of prophets. I think
[1:38:56] we ought to quote what a prophet spoke.
[1:39:01] And brother, I just want to tell you, I
[1:39:03] don't apologize for it. I don't try to
[1:39:06] water it down. I I believe it with all
[1:39:10] that's within me.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; It'll be a prophet's message that I am
[1:39:14] identified with. That's why Jesus said,
[1:39:17] "If they believe me, they'll believe. If
[1:39:19] they believe me, they believe the one
[1:39:21] who sent me. And if they believe you,
[1:39:23] they believe in me." Listen to it. Don't
[1:39:25] you know what the Bible says? He that
[1:39:27] receives a prophet in the name of a
[1:39:29] prophet shall receive a prophet's
[1:39:32] reward.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; What was that reward? A great part of
[1:39:36] heaven.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; And we don't need to quote a prophet so
[1:39:43] he stands out.
[1:39:45] You know, I'm not so sure. That was
[1:39:46] brother Brandon's opinion.
[1:39:49] You know, we need to get back just to
[1:39:50] the Bible. We don't need to quote
[1:39:51] brother Brandon. Do you see what would
[1:39:53] happen?
[1:39:56] What is play tapes?
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; You know, just push play, men of God.
[1:40:05] Put your iPad down. Put your Bible down.
[1:40:09] Stop preaching. Stop praying for
[1:40:10] inspiration. Stop waiting on the Lord
[1:40:13] for God to give you a word for the
[1:40:14] church that you're pastoring. You know,
[1:40:16] just let men of God. Don't you see what
[1:40:18] would happen if the devil had his way
[1:40:20] and men of God stop preaching the truth
[1:40:22] of this message? Jordan would flood your
[1:40:24] home. Sin would flood our worship. Sin
[1:40:27] would flood our youth. It flood our
[1:40:28] marriages. It would cover us. You ought
[1:40:31] to thank God for a pastor who will
[1:40:34] preach you the truth of the message of
[1:40:36] the hour and say, "Preach it, brother.
[1:40:38] Preach the truth. Don't back down. Don't
[1:40:42] compromise. I don't want a lie. I want
[1:40:45] an Abraham."
[1:40:46] Speak the word of God.
[1:40:51] Tell you what, I was in Be careful how I
[1:40:53] say this, but I was in a Central
[1:40:55] American country just last year. Brother
[1:40:57] Timothy and I was preaching there at
[1:40:59] multiple churches. Didn't know I the
[1:41:00] brother pastor never been before. He
[1:41:02] took me to church after church after
[1:41:03] church after church.
[1:41:06] God gave me something different for each
[1:41:07] one.
[1:41:10] And he's coming to the large city there.
[1:41:13] Wonderful pastor. He's going to be my
[1:41:15] interpreter that night. He had
[1:41:16] interpreted them for me. And so that
[1:41:18] morning, he wake he gets up. He says,
[1:41:20] "But Matt, I'm going to go to another
[1:41:21] church." I didn't know these churches.
[1:41:22] He didn't give me some intel report.
[1:41:24] Thank God no pastor does that. Brother
[1:41:27] Tim didn't tell me all y'all's problems
[1:41:28] and all y'all's issues. And did you,
[1:41:30] Brother Tim? No, we didn't do none of
[1:41:32] that. And he didn't say nothing. He just
[1:41:34] said, "We're going to go preach at this
[1:41:35] church here." And and and and he says,
[1:41:37] "Brother Matt, um you know, I'll pick
[1:41:39] you up at 3:00. He's a school teacher.
[1:41:41] He wakes up very early. Goes to work.
[1:41:43] He's pastor also. And he I'm waiting on
[1:41:45] the Lord all day just struggling. You
[1:41:47] know, it is sometimes, man, just
[1:41:48] struggling to you got so many things.
[1:41:50] Because the word of God is rich and
[1:41:52] deep. It's a bottomless well that we
[1:41:54] draw from. But you want something in
[1:41:56] season.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Something that hits the target.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; And I'm praying, waiting, just
[1:42:04] struggling all day. And I and it picks
[1:42:07] picks me up. And we're driving and I'm
[1:42:09] getting more nervous. Lord, what am I
[1:42:11] going to preach to these people? And I'm
[1:42:13] just praying there in the car as he's
[1:42:15] driving. He says, "Brother Matt, do you
[1:42:16] know what you're going to preach on
[1:42:17] tonight?" I said, "No, brother." To be
[1:42:19] honest, I said, "I I'm still just
[1:42:20] waiting on the Lord." He said, "Okay, no
[1:42:22] problem, brother man." And right when I
[1:42:23] said that, the Lord just struck me with
[1:42:26] a sermon I had only preached, had not
[1:42:28] preached in a very long time. I preached
[1:42:30] a sermon called, "The truth shall make
[1:42:32] you free."
[1:42:34] And I said, "The sermon will be the
[1:42:36] truth shall make you free."
[1:42:38] That brother looked at me and he began
[1:42:40] to quote my John 16 uh that I have many
[1:42:44] things to say to you but you can't hear
[1:42:45] but he when he the spirit of truth comes
[1:42:47] he began to quote my opening scriptures.
[1:42:50] I thought, "What in the world? How does
[1:42:51] he know my opening scriptures?" And we
[1:42:53] just keep driving in awkward silence.
[1:42:58] And I get to that church and here's 300
[1:43:01] people, believers, just a big old
[1:43:03] church. And what is one of the oldest
[1:43:05] churches there with the message,
[1:43:08] received the message back, I think it
[1:43:09] was the 8070s or ' 80s. And and and we
[1:43:11] go there and and I'm just waiting on the
[1:43:13] Lord and and and here we come. Here's
[1:43:15] the song. They're singing. And I walk
[1:43:17] out to that platform and I walk up and I
[1:43:20] open my Bible to John 16. And how be it
[1:43:22] when he the Spirit of truth comes, he
[1:43:24] will he'll he'll guide you into all
[1:43:26] truth for he shall not speak of himself.
[1:43:27] And and I could feel it. I could feel it
[1:43:30] as I was talking. This brother buddy, I
[1:43:34] was anointed. I don't even know what to
[1:43:36] call him.
[1:43:38] He was so on fire. It became at one
[1:43:40] point in that sermon, I I I started
[1:43:43] here. He was here. I was here like the
[1:43:45] interpreter and he was the preacher
[1:43:48] and he was preaching man. I mean he was
[1:43:50] just dynamic and I was thinking preach
[1:43:52] man you go and it was so powerful. He
[1:43:55] was just so inspired preaching that
[1:43:57] sermon. I got up in the middle of that
[1:43:59] sermon and I used that same exact
[1:44:00] example out of Joshua 4 and I used the
[1:44:02] priest and brought up six men and I said
[1:44:05] I want I said I want to use an example
[1:44:06] here and I said you brother come here
[1:44:08] and you brother come here and and you
[1:44:10] there in the back uh you two and you on
[1:44:12] the back wall caught a guy from the very
[1:44:13] back wall man big old long church I said
[1:44:15] you come here that'd be good and these
[1:44:17] six brothers come up and they make a
[1:44:18] foul line just like you brothers did and
[1:44:20] I start preaching I just what I just now
[1:44:22] did I put my hand over that brother I
[1:44:24] said what if this brother started saying
[1:44:26] we don't need to preach the message
[1:44:27] anymore more and we don't need to quote
[1:44:28] brother Brandham anymore. We're not
[1:44:30] going to quote him anymore. Yeah, he was
[1:44:32] a man of God. Yeah, he was a healer. But
[1:44:34] seventh angel, Malachi 4, I, you know,
[1:44:38] just got questioned, suspicious of it.
[1:44:40] Tell you what it is. They're ashamed of
[1:44:42] it.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; And they're ashamed to be identified.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; And I said, what would happen if they
[1:44:51] started, we don't need to quote the
[1:44:52] prophet anymore. We don't need to say,
[1:44:53] brother Brandham said, we just want
[1:44:54] Jesus. We're just going to go back to
[1:44:56] the Bible.
[1:44:58] And I I'll just tell you the message
[1:45:00] ain't for everybody. They go and say it.
[1:45:02] I'm trying to throw it, force it down
[1:45:04] somebody's throat. It ain't for
[1:45:05] everybody, but thank God it was for me.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. It
[1:45:11] was for me.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; And I began to preach that, buddy. When
[1:45:14] I preached that thought, Brother Joe, it
[1:45:16] was like a volcano erupted out of that
[1:45:19] church. They had sat quiet mostly, but
[1:45:21] all of a sudden, the bubble started
[1:45:23] flowing and people were shouting and
[1:45:25] rejoicing. I thought, man, it's like I
[1:45:27] hit a funny bone. What in the world?
[1:45:29] That church just exploded. People
[1:45:31] shouting. And at that part, I got out to
[1:45:33] the car and the pastor, I closed the
[1:45:35] door, his wife was just balling. And and
[1:45:37] brother, be careful not to say his name,
[1:45:39] but because he don't you you'll see why
[1:45:41] here in a moment. And he and he looks at
[1:45:42] me and he shuts the door and he says,
[1:45:44] "Now I can say it, brother Matt." He
[1:45:46] says, "Now I'm going to tell you what I
[1:45:47] didn't tell you what I was I determined
[1:45:49] in my heart not to tell you." And he
[1:45:51] says, "I woke up at 4:00 this morning
[1:45:53] and I asked God, God, give me I want to
[1:45:56] translate brother Matt good. Uh lead me
[1:45:58] to a sermon I could translate I could
[1:46:00] hear today while I'm at school so that I
[1:46:02] could translate him good." He said, "I
[1:46:03] went to your website. I scrolled through
[1:46:04] page after page. I randomly clicked the
[1:46:07] sermon you preached tonight."
[1:46:12] Hallelujah.
[1:46:17] He said, "Little did you know it,
[1:46:18] Brother Matt." And he said, "The pastor
[1:46:20] who has stood for this message for years
[1:46:22] has became old in his old age and he
[1:46:25] can't preach anymore." And he said, "Six
[1:46:27] brothers have been trying to turn this
[1:46:28] church out of the message. Started
[1:46:30] taking him down the route and saying we
[1:46:32] don't need to quote brother Brandham and
[1:46:33] we don't need to quote a prophet and we
[1:46:35] don't need to say brother Brandham
[1:46:36] said." He said, "Brother Matt, the
[1:46:38] spirit of God calls you to call all six
[1:46:40] of those men.
[1:46:50] God will back up his own word. This is
[1:46:54] not the message of a man. It is the
[1:46:57] message from the throne.
[1:47:03] Hallelujah.
[1:47:09] He wrote me back some months later. He
[1:47:11] wrote me wrote me on WhatsApp. I said,
[1:47:12] "Brother Matt, I got a testimony." He
[1:47:14] said that entire situation since you
[1:47:15] preached there turn around those those
[1:47:17] men are not in control. A pastor who is
[1:47:19] standing for the message is now in
[1:47:21] charge of that church. I say thank you
[1:47:22] Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Lord.
[1:47:30] Because men of God are not a lot.
[1:47:33] They're not a jellyfish. Not a
[1:47:35] compromiser afraid to speak the word of
[1:47:37] God. Listen you you. There's only one
[1:47:39] thing that'll set people free. The
[1:47:41] truth. Amen.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; And you got to speak it with bare
[1:47:44] knuckles. Don't be afraid of men. Don't
[1:47:46] be afraid of brother big bucks that
[1:47:49] might leave your church. Preach the word
[1:47:51] of God. No matter what it feels like to
[1:47:53] other people. I say, preacher, preach
[1:47:55] it. How many do we have a church that'll
[1:47:58] say, "Preach the word of God. Preach it
[1:48:00] without fear."
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; Where am I at?
[1:48:12] Lot could not separate himself.
[1:48:15] For some reason, there was a cord.
[1:48:20] But Sodom
[1:48:22] he couldn't break.
[1:48:29] His soul was grieved by the wickedness
[1:48:31] around him. But he stayed there. He
[1:48:33] built a home. He raised a family. And he
[1:48:36] sat in the gate, which means he was in a
[1:48:38] very important role. The prophet of God
[1:48:40] says became the mayor of that city and
[1:48:42] his wife followed, his children
[1:48:44] followed.
[1:48:45] He'd become comfortable in a place where
[1:48:48] sin was normal.
[1:48:50] And that's the tragedy of the legacy of
[1:48:53] Lot.
[1:48:56] Two nations will come out of you, Lot,
[1:48:58] Moab and Amnen. And little did you know,
[1:49:00] your decisions and choices, it wasn't
[1:49:02] the one big choice. Listen, it wasn't
[1:49:04] the one big choice that the devil get
[1:49:07] you to make. It's the little choices
[1:49:08] that you compromise.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; It's the little cho Just stay with me
[1:49:13] right here. I don't don't let me lose
[1:49:14] you right here. It's the little things
[1:49:16] that we allow. The prophet of God said,
[1:49:18] it's the little things we leave off.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't know that those decisions
[1:49:25] he's making, as the prophet says, he's
[1:49:27] seen the wellwater plains, but he didn't
[1:49:29] see the defilement of his family.
[1:49:31] He learned somehow to live at peace with
[1:49:35] what should have broken his heart.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; When judgment fell, angels had to take
[1:49:40] him by the hand to lead him out. His
[1:49:42] wife turned back looking for what she
[1:49:45] had left behind.
[1:49:49] Listen to what the prophet of God says
[1:49:50] here. Can I just go a few more minutes?
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Listen to what the prophet of God says
[1:49:56] here. I just want to read some of this
[1:49:57] as the Lord gave it to me. Now, Miss
[1:49:59] Lot, she didn't mean to do that. She
[1:50:02] went down there. She thought, "I'll just
[1:50:04] be sociable. It's all right. I'll just
[1:50:07] be sociable and become friends with
[1:50:09] them." You know, I I know they don't
[1:50:12] believe what I believe, but you know,
[1:50:14] and then I can dress in a certain way
[1:50:15] where they would never question. And,
[1:50:17] you know, I could just maybe maybe
[1:50:19] change my I don't have to be that, you
[1:50:20] know, that that weird or that odd or
[1:50:22] stand out that much.
[1:50:25] And then slowly that she just
[1:50:26] compromises more when she got gave God,
[1:50:29] brother Brandon says and when God gave
[1:50:30] her her last message of grace when he
[1:50:32] sent those angels down there and told
[1:50:34] them that within a few hours of Sodom
[1:50:35] and Gomorrah was going to be burned as
[1:50:37] she could not stand the thought of
[1:50:38] giving up her social life to come out
[1:50:40] into a desert lived like Sarah had lived
[1:50:41] out there in the desert have to wear
[1:50:43] common plain clothes of the women of the
[1:50:45] plain. She wanted to be in luxury. Her
[1:50:47] husband had become a great man in the
[1:50:49] city sat in the gate as a judge or mayor
[1:50:51] of the city. She wanted those luxuries.
[1:50:52] She could not stand the thought of
[1:50:54] having to give those things up. And as
[1:50:56] she went with her husband out of the
[1:50:57] city, she kept looking back, weeping and
[1:51:00] grieving because she had to give it up
[1:51:01] to separate herself from that type of
[1:51:03] death. She turned to a pillar of salt.
[1:51:05] She stands there to this day. It can be
[1:51:07] seen in the fields at the woman standing
[1:51:08] there with her head turned looking back.
[1:51:10] She's looking back over her left
[1:51:13] shoulder
[1:51:15] because her why her left shoulder is
[1:51:17] where her heart is. And brother Brandham
[1:51:20] says her heart was back there.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; You see, you can lead somebody out. You
[1:51:26] can take their body out.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; And many people with their body, they
[1:51:31] follow the message, but their heart is
[1:51:32] in a whole another place.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; In a marriage, long before that woman
[1:51:37] ever walks out, long before that man
[1:51:39] ever physically walks out, long before
[1:51:41] that, his heart walks out.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to somebody this morning.
[1:51:46] long before they leave the church and
[1:51:48] they leave the message and then suddenly
[1:51:50] their their own Facebook and their own,
[1:51:52] you know, Instagram and I could I
[1:51:53] couldn't believe it. I'm not not here in
[1:51:55] any way to judge the man, but he he he
[1:51:57] leaves and and I see someone's, you
[1:51:59] know, I'd seen a picture. Here he is and
[1:52:02] here's his daughters. Here was girls,
[1:52:04] lovely young ladies.
[1:52:08] And I I'm looking at that photo and here
[1:52:11] he is with a big proud look on his face
[1:52:13] and his daughter with half their body
[1:52:15] showing out to the entire world.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; I think to myself, this is what you want
[1:52:21] me to follow you out of.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; And and and the and the and let's go on.
[1:52:39] She looked back her heart brother says
[1:52:42] because she was forced to leave time
[1:52:46] test memorial 1957 she was forced. You
[1:52:49] can force someone to live this message.
[1:52:53] Oh, but there's a whole big difference,
[1:52:54] brother, when it comes from your heart
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; and when your heart is, that's the
[1:52:59] problem we got. And I'll go ahead and
[1:53:00] tell you right now, the problem we have,
[1:53:02] most of the problem in this message is
[1:53:04] that our hearts were never turned back
[1:53:06] to the original apostolic faith. We got
[1:53:08] a lot of people to dress right, talk
[1:53:10] right, look right, have all the cliches,
[1:53:12] have all the the right sayings, and look
[1:53:14] all the part. But, brother, what they
[1:53:16] need is a baptism of the Holy Ghost that
[1:53:19] burns out the sin out of their life. and
[1:53:23] changes them to a new creature and their
[1:53:25] heart is turned back.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; Such a difference when you force someone
[1:53:31] to leave, but their heart is still
[1:53:32] there. Many people take Christ that way
[1:53:34] because they come out of the world felt
[1:53:36] like they were feel like they were
[1:53:37] forced to do it. They keep longing and
[1:53:39] lusting and isn't long till they're back
[1:53:41] there thinking of the leaks and the
[1:53:42] garlics and and you know and all those
[1:53:44] things that Egypt had. You know the
[1:53:47] problem with eating leaks and garlics is
[1:53:49] you can smell it on their breath.
[1:53:54] And I tell you what happens when you as
[1:53:56] a message believer start eating leaks
[1:53:58] and garlic.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; You stink.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; And you can't hide it. Their life begins
[1:54:06] to look a certain way. You drift. You
[1:54:08] start drifting. Your dress code changes.
[1:54:10] You You You look like a believer at
[1:54:12] church, but on vacation, what you post
[1:54:14] to the world, you're wearing shorts.
[1:54:16] You're got a sleeveless shirt on. You
[1:54:19] What happened? You mean your
[1:54:20] Christianity was only good in the home
[1:54:22] state where you live in front of?
[1:54:24] Listen, if that's the kind of gospel
[1:54:25] that that we believe that it just
[1:54:27] changes a, you know, reforms a man, puts
[1:54:29] a new, you know, new dress code. Listen,
[1:54:31] if this message ain't nothing more than
[1:54:32] a dress code, I promise your children
[1:54:35] will find a a dress code that's more
[1:54:37] appeasing to if it ain't nothing but
[1:54:38] rules and regulations. It's as if it's
[1:54:41] just a lifestyle. Oh, come on, church.
[1:54:43] It's got to be more than that. It's got
[1:54:45] to be a living reality. something that
[1:54:48] burns in your very soul. It's the
[1:54:52] passion of your life to serve God.
[1:54:59] Little did Lot know. You didn't know
[1:55:01] when you were leaving. You didn't know.
[1:55:03] You didn't see it.
[1:55:06] Did you see it, brother? Did you see it?
[1:55:15] It's amazing to me people want to come
[1:55:16] years later. I'm just going to preach
[1:55:18] because the inspiration of the Holy
[1:55:19] Ghost has me here.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; It's amazing how people want to come
[1:55:23] later after brother Brandham's gone and
[1:55:25] start questioning.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; And then you get people that'll believe
[1:55:30] Brother Google over everything and now
[1:55:33] they're believing chat GPT
[1:55:35] and and Gemini and whatever other uh AI
[1:55:37] you want to use and and just take it as
[1:55:40] the gospel truth and and just believe it
[1:55:43] just like it was said. Well, if Google
[1:55:44] said, "Oh, Chad GPD says it." Boy,
[1:55:46] that's even, you know, more authority.
[1:55:47] I'm going to tell you, we've received a
[1:55:49] more sure word of prophecy.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; We don't have just the ways of Christ.
[1:55:54] We don't just have the acts of Christ.
[1:55:56] We have the mind of Christ.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says she knows what he
[1:56:00] wants done with his word. She has the
[1:56:02] mind. Uh here's the secret. The word is
[1:56:05] in the bride.
[1:56:08] and they want to come years later and
[1:56:11] question
[1:56:12] question him yet even when he was there.
[1:56:15] Can I read you brother? You have it
[1:56:17] there. Can I read you what some of his
[1:56:19] witnesses said while he was living? This
[1:56:21] is from Gordon Lindsay. He says, "Never,
[1:56:24] this is slide four, brother. If you have
[1:56:25] it, you can display it." He says, "Never
[1:56:27] had we known of any preacher calling
[1:56:29] death mutes and blind people to pray for
[1:56:32] and then to see those people delivered
[1:56:35] on the spot.
[1:56:37] a ministry that was beyond any that we
[1:56:40] had before witnessed. Listen to what
[1:56:43] this pre this man said here, James
[1:56:45] Morris. It was Brandham more than any of
[1:56:47] the evangelists who started the postw
[1:56:49] World War II fundamentalist healing
[1:56:50] revival following his counter with an
[1:56:52] angel on May 7th, 1946. Word radiated in
[1:56:56] every direction that all manner of
[1:56:57] diseases and afflictions were healed
[1:56:59] instantly by the little Indiana
[1:57:01] preacher. Even cases of raising the dead
[1:57:04] were published.
[1:57:07] Listen to what he says here. God has
[1:57:08] chosen servants. God chosen diverse and
[1:57:11] mysterious ways to reveal himself to
[1:57:13] servants, especially those called for
[1:57:14] dispensational purposes as was brother
[1:57:16] Brandham's call. In short, the man we
[1:57:19] know as William Brandham was sent to
[1:57:22] demonstrate God again in flesh.
[1:57:30] FF Bodler says when the gift is
[1:57:32] operating, brother Brandham is the most
[1:57:34] sensitive person to the presence and
[1:57:36] working of the Holy Spirit and the
[1:57:37] spiritualities of any person I have
[1:57:39] known. Morris Cerillo says God called
[1:57:41] this humble man, anointed his ministry
[1:57:43] to a degree that within a few short
[1:57:46] years his name was known in the most
[1:57:48] remote jungle outstation. Wherever you
[1:57:51] would go in the world, you would find
[1:57:53] the name of this messenger has preceded
[1:57:56] you.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; The full gospel men's voice says in
[1:57:59] Bible days, there were men of God who
[1:58:01] were prophets and seers. But in all
[1:58:03] those sacred records, none of these had
[1:58:05] a greater ministry than that of William
[1:58:06] Brandham, a prophet and seer of God
[1:58:08] whose photograph appears on the front
[1:58:10] cover of this issue of Full Gospel Men's
[1:58:11] Voice. Brandom has been used by God in
[1:58:14] the name of Jesus to raise the dead.
[1:58:20] Somehow we come
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; years later.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; Somehow we come and we we start
[1:58:28] questioning. Listen, it'd be just like
[1:58:30] me with Mike Tyson. You know, Brother
[1:58:32] Ron, you know, Mike Tyson, you know
[1:58:34] what? If I came to you and said, you
[1:58:35] know,
[1:58:38] I hear all the stories, but
[1:58:41] I think I could have took Mike
[1:58:49] I know they talk about his jab and they
[1:58:51] talk about his right hand. They talk
[1:58:53] about all but you know, brother Ron, I
[1:58:55] don't think Mike was all what y'all
[1:58:57] hyping him up to be.
[1:58:59] I think I could got in the ring with
[1:59:00] him. You know, I think I could have done
[1:59:02] some damage. You know how dumb that
[1:59:05] would be?
[1:59:09] Might be a fatal mistake.
[1:59:15] You know what the problem with that is?
[1:59:17] Is we have his I won't call them
[1:59:20] opponents. I'll call them victims.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; We have his victims.
[1:59:26] And we've seen the knockout punch of
[1:59:29] Mike Tyson. You got to plan until you're
[1:59:31] punched in the face.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; We've seen his victims fall one after
[1:59:36] the next after the next after the next
[1:59:39] with one after the next after that. How
[1:59:41] dumb would it be? I guarantee you you
[1:59:43] brought any of those victims up here
[1:59:45] today and gave them the microphone, I
[1:59:47] guarantee you they'd tell you Mike Tyson
[1:59:49] had a punch like you never seen. Well, I
[1:59:51] got news for these uh for these people
[1:59:54] that has wanted to get up and question a
[1:59:55] prophet and question the miracles. Why
[1:59:58] don't you give cancer a microphone and
[2:00:01] put him up here? Put blind eyes behind
[2:00:05] the pull pit. Let him speak. And I tell
[2:00:07] you what he'd tell you. He'd say, "The
[2:00:09] same God that was in Jesus
[2:00:13] stood behind this platform."
[2:00:17] Hallelujah.
[2:00:20] And I got news. He ain't never lost a
[2:00:22] battle and he never will.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, give God a great big shout right
[2:00:28] there.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:33] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:00:44] Did you know it, Lot, when you left
[2:00:47] Abraham?
[2:00:49] Did you know what you were leaving?
[2:00:53] Yeah. You loved it when
[2:00:56] you came out of your sin and followed
[2:00:59] him all the way through. Did you know
[2:01:01] it, Lot, when you were leaving the
[2:01:04] Abrahamic ministry
[2:01:07] that you were leaving the angels
[2:01:11] more than an angel? Melazdc.
[2:01:17] You were leaving the ministry of
[2:01:19] Melazdc.
[2:01:22] And you also would receive an angel.
[2:01:28] Did you know it was those two angels
[2:01:32] that brother Brandon types with the
[2:01:34] ministry of Billy Graham and Oral
[2:01:35] Roberts, good men, brother Brandon said,
[2:01:37] Christian men, but he says their
[2:01:40] ministry was just like those angels to
[2:01:42] Sodom that blinded
[2:01:44] the people.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; Go read that in we just read it in
[2:01:47] Genesis. They they blinded the people.
[2:01:49] And brother Brandham says, "What does
[2:01:50] that blinding come from? Flashing red
[2:01:52] light." He says it's living off the
[2:01:54] glare of another age.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; To point to an I was but failed to see
[2:01:59] the I am.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; To point to a god of brother Brandham.
[2:02:03] Come on somebody. But fail to see
[2:02:05] Listen, people can point you to a
[2:02:07] prophet and what he did in the 60s. But
[2:02:09] what about that God? I I'm all for
[2:02:11] Revelations 10:7. But what about
[2:02:13] Revelations 8 through11? That thou must
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; thou must prophesy. Listen, it ain't no
[2:02:19] choice, brother. I hope it falls on you
[2:02:21] like it fell on me. We ain't got a
[2:02:23] choice. The Bible says, "Thou must
[2:02:26] prophesy again."
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; You must
[2:02:33] Did you Did you know, brother
[2:02:37] Billy Graham or Roberts, did you know
[2:02:40] those would be the angels that preached
[2:02:42] a Jesus loves you? Yes, I know. Four,
[2:02:45] three, you know, Matthew, Mark, Luke,
[2:02:46] and John gospel and that was it. They
[2:02:49] believe the sessation that that the
[2:02:50] gifts and miracles stopped with the
[2:02:52] death of the last apostle. God, all that
[2:02:54] he spoke, he spoke and he has nothing
[2:02:56] else to say. All that he revealed is
[2:02:58] what he we have right here. Soloscriptor
[2:03:00] Torah is what they'll tell you that God
[2:03:02] is confined to this book. I'm so glad my
[2:03:05] God ain't got a chain or a collar around
[2:03:07] his neck. Chained to what men's
[2:03:09] imaginary God have created, but the God
[2:03:11] who spoke is still speaking. The God who
[2:03:14] was still is.
[2:03:18] and and and Billy Graham would come with
[2:03:20] that message to to to blind them and
[2:03:23] they would believe in other Jesus.
[2:03:24] Listen listen but but Billy Graham
[2:03:27] brother Adamson said was as tight as
[2:03:28] those Lot's angels that would go down to
[2:03:31] Sodom. Did you know it was Billy
[2:03:33] Graham's legacy that he would have a
[2:03:36] daughter named Anne?
[2:03:39] Her name Anne Graham. She'd marry a man
[2:03:43] with a last name that you probably never
[2:03:45] heard this one before. Lots
[2:03:51] lz. Go Google it if you want to.
[2:03:56] And Graham Lots. I don't think that's an
[2:04:01] accident because she's a preacher and
[2:04:04] she's got a website. You go to her
[2:04:05] website. You know what it's called? Lots
[2:04:07] angels.
[2:04:11] God don't do this on accident, friends.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; The ministry of Anne Graham Lots.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; I wonder if John, brother John, did you
[2:04:20] know brother John
[2:04:22] Ostein
[2:04:24] when you sat in brother Brandham's
[2:04:26] meetings and you sat there at the full
[2:04:28] gospel businessman's breakfast with
[2:04:29] Deeus Shakarion and here's Deeus who who
[2:04:32] stood with brother Brandham. Dimash
[2:04:34] Shakarian, you know, came there as a,
[2:04:36] you know, the fleeing refugee from the
[2:04:39] pograms, lands in California with Tatos.
[2:04:41] His greatgrandfather comes to California
[2:04:44] under the Isuza revival as attracted and
[2:04:46] magnetized to a ministry of the second
[2:04:49] pool, can see the discernment of hearts,
[2:04:51] can watch all of the miracles. The blind
[2:04:53] eyes and Deus wants to support that
[2:04:55] ministry as ministers breakfast invites
[2:04:58] men like like John Ostein. He's
[2:05:01] mentioned on tape. Brother Brandon
[2:05:02] mentions him. So good to see brother
[2:05:04] John Ostein here in the meetings. And
[2:05:06] Deeus Shicarian got to the point just
[2:05:09] like Deeus of Paul in the Bible where
[2:05:12] brother Brandon says Paul Deus looked at
[2:05:14] Paul's ministry and said you know what
[2:05:15] he's washed up. He ain't what he used to
[2:05:18] be. And Deus Shakarion
[2:05:22] closes the door walks away from brother
[2:05:24] Brandham. It was he was in that John was
[2:05:26] in that same group who could see the
[2:05:28] miracles. Even his wife healed of liver
[2:05:31] cancer,
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; but could never come under the Abrahamic
[2:05:37] ministry.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; Graham
[2:05:41] 56 G r a h a m could could be identified
[2:05:46] under that man anointing but never could
[2:05:49] be identified with an eagle anointing.
[2:05:53] John Ostein, did you know that when you
[2:05:57] left the ministry
[2:05:59] of Abraham, this is what you would
[2:06:02] produce? Go ahead, brother.
[2:06:04] Did you know this would be your legacy?
[2:06:09] Did you know that that your weak stand
[2:06:13] on truth, your compromise to allow your
[2:06:17] wife to cut her hair, wear makeup, wear
[2:06:19] earrings? Did you know this is what you
[2:06:21] I'm not preaching against that man.
[2:06:22] He'll stand before the judgment seat of
[2:06:24] Christ just like all of us. Except I'm
[2:06:27] judged here, not there.
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; Thank God. Some men's follow them. Sons
[2:06:31] go some sins some men's sins follow
[2:06:34] them. Some go before them.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; I'm glad my sins go before him.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Did you know that when you left the
[2:06:41] ministry, John, this is what you
[2:06:45] produced? How about you, brother Deus?
[2:06:47] Did you know that your great great great
[2:06:50] grandchildren?
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; Go Google this.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; Would be the Kardashians.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; Yep. Fact.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; Did you know what you were doing when
[2:07:03] you left the ministry
[2:07:06] of the son of man? Did you know? Did you
[2:07:08] see this? Did you calculate it?
[2:07:11] And I ask you the same question as I
[2:07:13] feel the uncction of the Holy Ghost. Do
[2:07:16] you know that when you leave this
[2:07:18] message, this is what you're going to
[2:07:27] the legacy of Lot, the legacy of
[2:07:30] compromise,
[2:07:32] the legacy, listen to what brother
[2:07:33] Brandham says here. Oh, but let me tell
[2:07:35] you about another legacy. I tell you
[2:07:37] what legacy I want to be identified
[2:07:39] with. Uh, go to the next slide. I've got
[2:07:41] a different legacy in my name. I got a
[2:07:44] different legacy and it ain't
[2:07:46] compromised. It's a man who stood for
[2:07:48] the word of God. Stood for the truth of
[2:07:51] the hour. Didn't back down to the voices
[2:07:54] of richness, the voices of money, the
[2:07:56] voice of popularity, the voice of women.
[2:07:59] He stood for the word of God. I tell you
[2:08:02] why there was a a Lot's wife, Brother
[2:08:04] Tim. Cuz there was a Lot. But I tell you
[2:08:06] why there was a Sarah. Cuz there was an
[2:08:08] Abraham. I tell you why there was a
[2:08:10] Rebecca. There was an Isaac.
[2:08:14] Thank God for Isaac. Thank God for
[2:08:17] Eleazar.
[2:08:19] You can be a Rebecca cuz you had an
[2:08:22] Ellie.
[2:08:24] Oh, give God a great big hand clap of
[2:08:26] praise.
[2:08:28] Hallelujah.
[2:08:33] You got to thank God for the men of God
[2:08:35] in your life and stand
[2:08:38] for the words. Come on, musicians.
[2:08:41] Come on musician.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; Thank what's your legacy brother
[2:08:50] Brandham?
[2:08:55] Because thou has chosen
[2:08:58] the narrow path harder way. Thou has
[2:09:01] walked in your own choosing. Thou has
[2:09:02] picked the correct and price precise
[2:09:04] decision and it's my way. because of
[2:09:07] this momentous decision.
[2:09:10] Slide 15. A huge huge Somebody say huge,
[2:09:18] huge portion of heaven will await thee.
[2:09:22] What a glorious decision thou has made.
[2:09:25] This in itself is that which will give
[2:09:27] and make come to pass the tremendous
[2:09:29] victory in the love divine. Voice asked,
[2:09:32] "Would you like to see just beyond the
[2:09:34] curtain?" I answered it. It would
[2:09:38] it would help me so much.
[2:09:42] I think as I read those words,
[2:09:45] it helped Brother Brandham to go beyond
[2:09:46] the curtain, but it helped me so much.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; I've lost loved ones, too. And to know
[2:09:54] that they didn't just end their life
[2:09:55] with the last breath, but they're living
[2:09:57] more today than they were when they were
[2:09:59] here.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; Just beyond the last breath. Brother
[2:10:03] Brandham says just beyond this veil of
[2:10:05] flesh is a land where they're living
[2:10:07] real life. It's the continuation of this
[2:10:09] same life without sin.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; It would help me what happened. I cannot
[2:10:14] say this in body out or whether in
[2:10:16] translation I don't know is unlike any
[2:10:17] vision I've ever had. I could see the
[2:10:19] place to which I was taken. See myself
[2:10:21] laying back there upon my bed and I said
[2:10:22] this is a strange thing. There were
[2:10:23] great numbers of people that came
[2:10:25] running to greet me. Oh our precious
[2:10:26] brother. First came young women
[2:10:28] apparently in their early 20s as they
[2:10:29] would embrace me. They said our precious
[2:10:31] brother. Young men and the brilliance of
[2:10:33] young man who with eyes glistening.
[2:10:35] Listen to this. Stars of dark and night,
[2:10:37] white teeth. You might have been yellow
[2:10:38] here. They're white over there. White as
[2:10:40] pearls embraced me saying, "Our precious
[2:10:44] brother."
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; Notice how they he meant so much to
[2:10:48] them. I noticed I two had become young
[2:10:50] again. I looked at myself there, turned
[2:10:53] and looked back at my old body laying on
[2:10:54] the bed with my hands behind my head. I
[2:10:56] said, "I don't understand this." Begin
[2:10:58] to try to comprehend the place where I
[2:10:59] was. As I began to realize that there
[2:11:00] was no yesterday, there was no tomorrow.
[2:11:03] No one seemed to get tired. As a
[2:11:05] multitude, the most beautiful young
[2:11:06] women I've ever seen threw their arms
[2:11:08] around me, I discovered there was only
[2:11:10] great love that overwhelmed me. No
[2:11:11] physical attraction is in the human
[2:11:13] behavior. I noticed these young women
[2:11:15] were all wore their hair down to their
[2:11:16] waistline. Their skirts went down to
[2:11:18] their feet. After this hope, my first
[2:11:20] wife hugged me, said, "My precious
[2:11:21] brother." Now, the young woman hugged
[2:11:23] me. Hope turned and hugged the young
[2:11:24] woman. I don't understand. There's
[2:11:26] something entirely different from our
[2:11:27] human love. But I don't want to go back
[2:11:30] to that old body on the bed. Oh, I can
[2:11:32] hear it calling me today. I can hear the
[2:11:35] heels of home and say, "I'm done with
[2:11:37] this natural life. I'm done with the
[2:11:39] sorrow and the trouble and the sadness
[2:11:42] and the tears. I'm ready to go to a
[2:11:44] place where there's no sickness. There's
[2:11:47] no death. There's no pain.
[2:11:49] But more than that, there's no sin."
[2:11:57] Boy spoke to me. He said, "This is what
[2:11:58] you preach that the Holy Ghost is. This
[2:12:00] is perfect love. Nothing can enter here
[2:12:04] without it." Taking up seated on a high
[2:12:06] place around our great numbers of men
[2:12:07] and women in the bloom of youth.
[2:12:10] They were crying with joy. Our precious
[2:12:12] brother, we're so happy to see you here.
[2:12:15] I thought, I'm not dreaming for I can
[2:12:17] see these people. I could see my body
[2:12:20] laying back there on the bed. The voice
[2:12:21] spoke to me. You know, it's written in
[2:12:22] the Bible that prophets were gathered
[2:12:24] with their people. I said, 'Yes, I
[2:12:26] remember that in scripture, but there
[2:12:27] are not this many Brandhams." The voice
[2:12:28] replied, "These are not Brandhams. These
[2:12:31] are your converts, the ones you have led
[2:12:33] to the Lord. Some of these women that
[2:12:36] you think are so young and beautiful
[2:12:37] were more than 90 years old when you led
[2:12:39] them to the Lord." I call that grace
[2:12:42] amazing grace.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; No wonder they're crying out, "My
[2:12:45] precious brother." Multitude cried and
[2:12:47] said, "If you hadn't gone forth with the
[2:12:50] gospel, we wouldn't be here." That's my
[2:12:53] thought. I want to end right here and
[2:12:55] say I want my children to look at me on
[2:12:58] that day and say daddy because you if
[2:13:00] you had not taken a stand for the word
[2:13:02] of God it was your stand and your
[2:13:05] conviction and your testimony that's why
[2:13:09] I'm here.
[2:13:17] I want to say to the men of God around
[2:13:19] the whole world. I want to say to these
[2:13:20] men of God right here, keep preaching
[2:13:22] it, brother. Keep preaching it. Keep
[2:13:24] standing upon it. Keep coming inspired.
[2:13:27] Keep preaching under the inspiration of
[2:13:28] the Holy Ghost. We're going to go home
[2:13:30] one day.
[2:13:33] Hallelujah.
[2:13:36] Going to go home one day. You go home
[2:13:39] one day and all trouble. Bow your heads
[2:13:42] with me. All trouble will be gone.
[2:13:52] I asked
[2:13:53] Where's Jesus? I want to see him. People
[2:13:56] replied, "Oh, he's just a little higher.
[2:14:00] Someday he will come to you. You were
[2:14:03] sent as a leader. When God comes, he
[2:14:05] will judge you according to your
[2:14:07] teaching." I asked, "Does Paul and Peter
[2:14:09] have to stand this judgment also?" They
[2:14:11] answered, "Yes." I said, "I I've
[2:14:14] preached what they preached. I didn't
[2:14:16] divert from it to one side or the other.
[2:14:20] Were they baptized in Jesus' name? I did
[2:14:22] too. Where they taught the baptism in
[2:14:23] the Holy Spirit, I did too. Whatever
[2:14:25] they taught, I taught also. We know that
[2:14:28] the people cried. And we know that
[2:14:29] you're going back to earth with you
[2:14:31] some. And we're going back to earth with
[2:14:32] you sometime. Jesus will come and judge
[2:14:35] you according to the word you preached
[2:14:36] us. Then you will present us to him and
[2:14:40] all together we will go back to earth to
[2:14:42] live forever. I asked, "Do I have to go
[2:14:44] back to earth now?" They answered,
[2:14:45] "Yes." But here's the message. Keep
[2:14:47] pressing on. I began to move from that
[2:14:50] beautiful joyful place. As far as my
[2:14:52] eyes could see, people were coming to to
[2:14:54] me to embrace me saying, "My precious
[2:14:55] brother, my precious brother." Suddenly,
[2:14:58] I was back on the bed. I said, "Oh God,"
[2:15:00] I wonder if this be your prayer today.
[2:15:02] You want to raise a hand and say, "Oh
[2:15:04] God, help me. Never let me compromise
[2:15:07] with the word. Let me stay straight on
[2:15:10] the word. I don't care what anyone else
[2:15:12] does, Lord. Let me press to that
[2:15:15] beautiful place.
[2:15:18] How many want it today? Want to press
[2:15:21] Lord? I want to press. I might have been
[2:15:23] on the sideline doubting and confused
[2:15:25] and suspicious of this. Today I want to
[2:15:28] let my faith rest on the only thing it
[2:15:30] can rest upon. It can't rest upon
[2:15:32] emotion. It can't rest, brother Adam
[2:15:33] said, on intellect. It's got to rest.
[2:15:35] It's faith has one resting place. That's
[2:15:37] the eternal word of God. And I want to
[2:15:39] say, Lord, let me rest my faith on that
[2:15:42] eternal word that changes not. I'm more
[2:15:44] convinced in my life that it will take
[2:15:46] perfect love to enter this place. There
[2:15:48] was no jealousy, no tiredness, no
[2:15:50] sickness, no old age, no death, only
[2:15:52] supreme beauty and joy. Whatever you do,
[2:15:55] whatever you do, hear the words of a
[2:15:57] vindicated prophet. Whatever you do,
[2:15:59] brother, whatever you do, sister, lay
[2:16:01] aside everything else until you get
[2:16:04] perfect love. Get to where you can love
[2:16:06] everybody, even every enemy. No matter
[2:16:09] if the plane is rocking, the lightning
[2:16:11] is flashing, the guns of the enemy are
[2:16:12] upon you. These things do no matter.
[2:16:15] These things don't matter. Get perfect
[2:16:19] love.
[2:16:23] And if you're not saved, accept Jesus as
[2:16:25] your savior right now. I I'd invite you
[2:16:27] to under the sound of my breath in this
[2:16:29] last service. If you don't know the
[2:16:31] Lord, you could know him today. If
[2:16:32] you've not been baptized, I'll give you
[2:16:34] the opportunity. Be baptized now. If you
[2:16:36] haven't received the second most
[2:16:37] important baptism, the baptism of the
[2:16:39] Holy Ghost, receive it now. And if you
[2:16:42] say, "God, I want to get I I have I've
[2:16:44] come that far, but I need to press to
[2:16:46] the place of perfect love. I want to
[2:16:47] say, Lord, let me press to that place
[2:16:50] where there's joy and beauty, a place,
[2:16:52] Lord, of perfect love. Grant it, Jesus,
[2:16:55] I pray. Grant it, Lord, to every life,
[2:16:57] to my home, to my family, to my
[2:17:00] children, Lord. Grant it, I pray.
[2:17:04] Leave us Lord with a legacy of faith,
[2:17:07] hope, love, belief. Not a God who was,
[2:17:12] but the God I know is the God I that I
[2:17:15] am. I am the same yesterday, today, and
[2:17:19] forever. I am a very present help in the
[2:17:24] time of trouble. I am a rock in a dry
[2:17:28] desert land. I am the mana that fell
[2:17:31] down from heaven. I am.
[2:17:34] Whatever you need today. Whatever you
[2:17:36] need. He's the God of the I am.
[2:17:42] We shall see miracles.
[2:17:46] We shall see giants.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; We'll walk to

[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, put your faith there. I will see
[2:18:47] giants fall. How many believe that?
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; Don't say we might. Say we will.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; We shall. We shall possess the gate of
[2:18:55] the enemy. This ain't a hope. So we will
[2:18:58] see miracles.
[2:19:00] Oh, let your faith grab a hold of that.
