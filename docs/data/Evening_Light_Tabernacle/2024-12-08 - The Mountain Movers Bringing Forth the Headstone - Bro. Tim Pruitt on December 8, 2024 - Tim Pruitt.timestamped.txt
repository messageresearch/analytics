[1:03:09] today as we did last Sunday and I want
[1:03:14] you to mark your calendars we've invited
[1:03:17] brother Murphy Wong for the last Sunday
[1:03:20] of December that's the 29th and then
[1:03:23] Tuesday night on the 31st we will have a
[1:03:25] new Year's Eve service we'll be making
[1:03:28] more announcements about that brother
[1:03:30] Murphy is of originally from China and
[1:03:34] um he
[1:03:36] um um is one who has translated the King
[1:03:40] James English Bible into Chinese
[1:03:43] language and made it available for the
[1:03:46] Chinese people we were blessed to be
[1:03:49] able to go there some years ago and went
[1:03:51] into Shanghai and priest and underground
[1:03:54] churches where that ministered there and
[1:03:57] also talked to a whole group of about 40
[1:04:00] ministers there and just shared with
[1:04:02] them the things that God has done in our
[1:04:05] generation so you know there's a great
[1:04:08] work that is going on there and um
[1:04:10] brother Murphy will be here I don't know
[1:04:13] maybe he will talk a little bit about
[1:04:15] that they just been able to meet with uh
[1:04:18] a group of them from China some
[1:04:20] ministers came over to the Philippines
[1:04:22] because they they could not safely meet
[1:04:25] there in China um things are very very
[1:04:28] tight now under the communistic regime
[1:04:31] so um they met in Philippines and had a
[1:04:35] a great meeting time there and a reunion
[1:04:38] time um brother Murphy has a um a an
[1:04:43] outstanding warrant for his arrest in
[1:04:45] China because if he goes back there they
[1:04:48] will arrest him because of of printing
[1:04:51] and and distributing uh the the the
[1:04:55] Bible they have a Bible in the Chinese
[1:04:58] language there it is one that is
[1:05:00] approved by the government and it is
[1:05:03] leaves out much of the scripture because
[1:05:05] they don't want anybody talking about
[1:05:07] end time prophecies or anything to do
[1:05:10] with Resurrection or Rapture or nothing
[1:05:12] like that so they uh have a very limited
[1:05:16] edition of the Bible that they will
[1:05:18] allow and it's approved but if you have
[1:05:21] one that is not approved well then you
[1:05:24] uh can go to prison and some of the
[1:05:25] brothers did go to prison uh the pastors
[1:05:28] that I know that I even spoke for over
[1:05:30] there and and was with went to prison
[1:05:33] for some time spent three to four years
[1:05:35] in prison and said they would do it all
[1:05:38] over again for the Gospel of Jesus
[1:05:41] Christ amen so brother Murphy will be
[1:05:43] here the last Sunday and um he'll
[1:05:47] Minister for us and then Tuesday night
[1:05:49] on the 31st and um next Sunday we will
[1:05:53] have communion foot washing you say well
[1:05:55] what is all of that about well it's just
[1:05:58] remembering the Lord's death and uh also
[1:06:02] why we are inent here and that is to
[1:06:04] serve and these are ordinances that
[1:06:06] Jesus put in place this is something
[1:06:08] that we do now if you don't partake in
[1:06:11] that that's all right you can come to
[1:06:13] service and we'll we'll have service and
[1:06:15] then right after that we will have a
[1:06:17] little dismissal and and the rest can
[1:06:20] stay for the communion foot washing and
[1:06:22] then we'll have a wonderful time
[1:06:23] together with a fellowship meal here
[1:06:25] together so Zachariah
[1:06:29] 4:6 then he answered and spake unto me
[1:06:32] saying this is the word of the Lord
[1:06:35] under zerubabel now not going all over
[1:06:37] the scripture again but remember he had
[1:06:40] seen these seven lampstands and he
[1:06:43] wondered what it was and he said this is
[1:06:46] the word right so what he was seeing was
[1:06:50] the word in symbolic
[1:06:52] form but now it would have to be made
[1:06:55] known to him through through the angel
[1:06:58] of God to know what the meaning was so
[1:07:02] he says this is the word the Lord unto
[1:07:04] zerubabel saying nor by might nor by
[1:07:08] power but by my spirit sayith the Lord
[1:07:10] of hosts who art thou oh great Mountain
[1:07:13] before zerubabel Thou shalt become a
[1:07:15] plain and he shall bring forth The
[1:07:18] Headstone thereof with shoutings crying
[1:07:22] Grace Grace unto it amen God bless you
[1:07:26] you can be seated now today we're going
[1:07:29] to be speaking on bringing forth The
[1:07:32] Headstone and and there are things that
[1:07:35] I want to look at again as we examine
[1:07:39] this prophecy of
[1:07:41] Zachariah because it is the story of
[1:07:44] restoration and worship uh of worship
[1:07:48] and the rebuilding of the temple and of
[1:07:51] Jerusalem and of course um Jerusalem is
[1:07:54] a type
[1:07:56] of the bride of Christ who's called the
[1:07:58] New Jerusalem so you know the the small
[1:08:01] picture is what um zerubba would be able
[1:08:04] to see as it was explained to him by
[1:08:07] Zachariah um it was just the the small
[1:08:10] picture but it was a much larger thing
[1:08:13] than God that God was doing and that was
[1:08:16] of course to uh bring a restoration even
[1:08:21] of his body the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:08:25] and he here in zachariah's Prophecy it
[1:08:28] describes the restoration as an
[1:08:31] impossible Mountain to
[1:08:33] move but zerubabel is assured that the
[1:08:37] mountain would be moved by God's spirit
[1:08:41] and that he would bring forth the
[1:08:42] finishing stone or The Headstone so cap
[1:08:46] C capture on that thought finishing
[1:08:48] Stone was shoutings of Grace Grace of
[1:08:52] course you know it would not be by man's
[1:08:55] might or by by Man's power but he said
[1:08:58] by my spirit sayeth the Lord and it
[1:09:01] would be the grace of God that would
[1:09:04] bring it down now we are also in an hour
[1:09:07] of restoration it's the end of the world
[1:09:10] and it is Harvest time and it is a also
[1:09:14] time for the finishing Stone now at
[1:09:17] harvest the original seed that was
[1:09:20] planted and went through its stages of
[1:09:22] growth it goes back to seed again
[1:09:26] and thus it is the head of the plant so
[1:09:30] in its own way the grain or the seed is
[1:09:33] The
[1:09:34] Headstone it is also the foundation
[1:09:38] stone so we know that the headstone of
[1:09:41] course is of the church is Christ and he
[1:09:46] is the foundation of which we are built
[1:09:48] upon and then of course the finishing
[1:09:50] Stone will be the return of Christ and
[1:09:54] so even as a seed goes from planting to
[1:09:58] Decay and through the cycle of Life
[1:10:00] coming up as a blade and and from there
[1:10:03] in the developmental stages of growth of
[1:10:05] tsel and husk and finally the seed of
[1:10:08] again even so the churches went from one
[1:10:13] Harvest cycle at Pentecost where the
[1:10:17] Harvest is celebrated to the planting
[1:10:20] and through the growth cycle until we
[1:10:22] come back to the final Harvest cycle and
[1:10:25] bring forth the head of the plant the
[1:10:28] seed again now the and God's Great
[1:10:32] Harvest cycle begins right after the
[1:10:35] Passover and this is the way it was in
[1:10:38] ancient Israel and even so after the
[1:10:41] true Passover where Jesus became the
[1:10:44] lamb um began the Harvest cycle and in
[1:10:48] Jesus day there was a harvest of the Old
[1:10:51] Testament Church with the promise given
[1:10:55] of a harvest of the Gentile Church which
[1:10:58] would be marked 7 weeks later and would
[1:11:02] be at Pentecost and and this would be
[1:11:05] the celebration of the of the finishing
[1:11:08] of the seven weeks between the Passover
[1:11:12] and um and and the the final Harvest
[1:11:15] there at Pentecost so seven weeks would
[1:11:18] be marked from the Passover all the way
[1:11:20] to Pentecost and of course it is the
[1:11:23] type of the seven Church agent
[1:11:26] are the seven golden lampstands are the
[1:11:28] seven churches in the Book of Revelation
[1:11:31] chap 1 which was symbolic
[1:11:34] representing Seven Ages and and for
[1:11:38] Israel they were to bring forth the
[1:11:40] first fruits or they were to bring the
[1:11:42] first fruits of their Harvest and they
[1:11:44] were to wave it before the Lord as a
[1:11:47] testimony of his goodness in Leviticus
[1:11:50] 23:10 he said speak to the children of
[1:11:54] Israel and say say unto them when you
[1:11:56] are come to the land which I give unto
[1:11:59] you and shall reap the this Harvest
[1:12:02] thereof then you shall bring a sheath of
[1:12:05] the the first fruits of your Harvest
[1:12:07] unto the priest and he shall wave it
[1:12:11] before the Sheep before the Lord to be
[1:12:14] accepted for you on the tomorrow after
[1:12:17] the Sabbath shall the priest wave it and
[1:12:20] how fitting it is today to think about
[1:12:23] this how that Jesus was not only the
[1:12:27] Passover
[1:12:28] Lamb himself but and thus he was a
[1:12:31] kinsman redeemer but also he was the
[1:12:34] first fruit of the Old Testament to
[1:12:38] raise from the dead thus being the first
[1:12:41] fruit of the resurrection and the
[1:12:44] Apostle Paul
[1:12:46] recognizes the significance of this when
[1:12:48] he says in 1 Corinthians 15:20 but now
[1:12:52] Christ is risen from the dead and become
[1:12:56] the first fruits of them that slept
[1:12:59] that's right so Jesus um W would be the
[1:13:03] first fruits of those that SLE and I
[1:13:06] want you to think and bear in mind and
[1:13:08] connect the the thoughts now the first
[1:13:11] fruits is the head or the first of the
[1:13:15] Harvest and it's and its own way this
[1:13:18] correlates with um W with what he says
[1:13:21] when he shall bring forth The Headstone
[1:13:24] the finishing stones with shoutings of
[1:13:27] Grace Grace into it now in the in
[1:13:31] ancient Israel and probably even today
[1:13:34] maybe they have different crops there
[1:13:36] now but in ancient Israel there were two
[1:13:39] major grain crops that were harvested
[1:13:43] the first of these was The Barley
[1:13:46] Harvest and then the other of course
[1:13:48] would be the wheat Harvest these were
[1:13:50] the two major agricultur crops and the
[1:13:54] Jewish Church Church represented the
[1:13:57] barley Harvest because the barley is the
[1:14:00] first to come to harvest and through
[1:14:03] their long growth from Adam The Original
[1:14:06] Seed where like a seed he died and and
[1:14:10] Abraham through Moses and law and the
[1:14:13] law and through the Kings and then
[1:14:14] through the prophets until finally the
[1:14:17] head of all of it came Jesus the King of
[1:14:21] Kings amen Jesus the greatest and a and
[1:14:25] the head of all the prophets Jesus not
[1:14:29] just the law but the lawgiver himself
[1:14:32] the word made
[1:14:35] flesh now and so Israel was required to
[1:14:38] bring a sheep of the first fruits before
[1:14:41] God to be waved and lifted up before the
[1:14:44] people thanking God for the Harvest
[1:14:48] before they could take uh partake of the
[1:14:50] crop and the the Feast of the first
[1:14:52] fruits would begin the day after the
[1:14:55] Passover celebrating the Harvest Time
[1:14:59] and from Adam only onward Jesus was the
[1:15:02] first of the Old Testament Harvest to
[1:15:05] come to maturity and with him came many
[1:15:10] other Saints if you look with me to
[1:15:13] Matthew chap 27 and verse 51 this is
[1:15:16] sometimes glossed over and missed but it
[1:15:18] says and the behold the veil of the
[1:15:21] temple was rent in Twain from top to the
[1:15:25] bottom and the Earth did quake and the
[1:15:28] Rocks rent now stop for a minute and
[1:15:30] let's think about it here the temple was
[1:15:32] and and the veil of the temple is ran
[1:15:35] open showing there was no God in the old
[1:15:39] worship that's right he was now hanging
[1:15:41] on a
[1:15:42] cross amen now here he was and and God
[1:15:46] was showing now the veil was broken and
[1:15:50] a way made by him in order to bring you
[1:15:55] into the presence of God no no longer
[1:15:58] were you being kept out but now you are
[1:16:01] invited in aren't you glad for that amen
[1:16:05] the veil is no longer to keep you out
[1:16:08] the veil is the door in Jesus said I am
[1:16:11] the door I am the way I am the truth and
[1:16:15] I'm the life and notice and the graves
[1:16:19] were opened and many bodies of the
[1:16:22] Saints which slept arose and came out of
[1:16:25] the graves after his resurrection and
[1:16:27] went into the holy city and appeared
[1:16:30] unto many oh my what a what a wonderful
[1:16:33] time that must have been amen look what
[1:16:36] happened there look look what was
[1:16:38] happening The Barley Harvest of the Old
[1:16:41] Testament Saints was now fully
[1:16:45] ripe and and ready ready to be harvested
[1:16:50] and on the first day of the week on
[1:16:53] Sunday morning tomorrow after the
[1:16:56] Sabbath as the priest as the the Jewish
[1:17:00] priests were were going through the
[1:17:03] motions of bringing the first fruits of
[1:17:05] the barley Harvest to be waved God as a
[1:17:09] high priest raised up Jesus Christ the
[1:17:13] first fruits of the resurrection and the
[1:17:16] spirit took and waved him and he broke
[1:17:18] through the tomb and he ascended on high
[1:17:21] and with him came the redeemed of all
[1:17:24] the Old Testament and they Rose and
[1:17:27] appeared to many the waving of the
[1:17:31] sheath what a wonderful thing that is
[1:17:34] now Isaiah made a prophecy and he said
[1:17:38] in Isaiah 28 and6 therefore thus sayith
[1:17:42] the Lord behold I lay in Zion Zion is
[1:17:46] another word for Jerusalem I lay in Zion
[1:17:50] for a foundation a stone a trag Stone a
[1:17:56] precious stone a sure foundation and he
[1:17:59] that believeth in me shall not make
[1:18:01] haste or be
[1:18:03] confounded amen so he he is the one who
[1:18:06] ties it all
[1:18:08] together you see all of the Old
[1:18:11] Testament Saints they they and
[1:18:14] everything in the scripture was
[1:18:16] prophesying one day the head of all of
[1:18:19] this will come that's right it's just
[1:18:21] like the blade coming up I'm not the I'm
[1:18:24] not the Great
[1:18:25] but there's one coming after me and it
[1:18:27] comes another and here comes the the the
[1:18:29] husk and I'm not the grain but there's
[1:18:32] one coming after me you see they were
[1:18:34] pointing to and prophesying of it and so
[1:18:38] Jesus was he was the Psalms of David he
[1:18:42] was the wisdom of Solomon he was the law
[1:18:46] of the prophets amen he was the prophecy
[1:18:49] of the prophet he was the word made
[1:18:53] manifest
[1:18:55] all of the word of the Old Testament was
[1:18:58] encapsulated in Jesus
[1:19:01] Christ
[1:19:03] hallelujah what a mighty God we have and
[1:19:06] we serve today to realize that all that
[1:19:10] Jesus was the Fulfillment of the Old
[1:19:13] Testament not in the sense that that
[1:19:16] does is no longer pertinent to us but he
[1:19:19] fulfilled the types and the
[1:19:22] shadows and he would he he he would now
[1:19:25] be the the very sacrifice the very lamb
[1:19:28] that was promised so he's the one who
[1:19:31] ties it all together he's the one the
[1:19:34] builders in Jesus time the Pharisees and
[1:19:37] the Sadducees
[1:19:39] rejected now let me tell you it's going
[1:19:42] to happen again in the last days and I I
[1:19:45] tell you why because the Bible said all
[1:19:47] the world will wonder after the Beast
[1:19:49] and His Image and they will all worship
[1:19:52] him so you see this is how all ends up
[1:19:55] is with the with the Cornerstone or The
[1:19:57] Headstone being rejected because even as
[1:20:01] it was rejected in that day so will the
[1:20:04] word in this day be crucified and
[1:20:07] rejected mocked and made
[1:20:10] shame now Psalms chapter 118 and verse
[1:20:16] 22 David now prophesying by the spirit
[1:20:20] and he says the stone which the builders
[1:20:24] refuse
[1:20:25] it has become The Headstone of the
[1:20:30] corner this is the Lord's doing and it's
[1:20:33] marvelous in our
[1:20:35] eyes Hallelujah this is the day which
[1:20:38] the Lord has made we will be glad and
[1:20:40] rejoice in it so it's a day of
[1:20:44] rejoicing amen when when we see that the
[1:20:47] the
[1:20:48] stone the stone the builders rejected
[1:20:51] the very word that they condemned has
[1:20:55] they refused and and the now has become
[1:20:58] The Headstone of the
[1:21:01] corner amen it's the Lord's
[1:21:05] doing and it brings about
[1:21:07] rejoicing now Israel with their Great
[1:21:12] Law and their Halls of learning and
[1:21:15] their scribes their Pharisees their
[1:21:18] rabbis or
[1:21:19] lawyers the the Sadducees as well who
[1:21:22] were all theologians yeah none of them
[1:21:25] could bring forth The Headstone and when
[1:21:28] he came they rejected
[1:21:32] him oh they were the scholars but they
[1:21:35] said oh he can't be it it's impossible
[1:21:39] so when you look at Romans
[1:21:42] 9:31 Paul tells us that Israel which
[1:21:45] followed after the law of righteousness
[1:21:48] had not attained to the law of
[1:21:51] righteousness wherefore because they
[1:21:52] sought it not by faith but as it were by
[1:21:55] works of the laws you see for they
[1:21:58] stumbled at that stumbling Stone as it
[1:22:01] is written behold I lay in Zion a
[1:22:03] stumbling stone and a rock of offense
[1:22:06] and whosoever believeth on him shall not
[1:22:09] be
[1:22:10] ashamed so if you if you look here in
[1:22:12] the scripture this is what he said they
[1:22:15] they had the law of righteousness and
[1:22:17] they followed after it but they did it
[1:22:20] you know just as works it was it was
[1:22:23] only works it was never by by faith it
[1:22:26] was never by Revelation faith is a
[1:22:30] revelation so you see they they tried it
[1:22:33] by their works of You Know M that was
[1:22:36] going to keep everything just perfect
[1:22:38] and do everything just perfectly and if
[1:22:41] you didn't well then you received the
[1:22:43] penalty of of the law and and
[1:22:45] everybody's watching to make sure you
[1:22:48] didn't even do as much as pluck corn on
[1:22:50] the Sabbath day
[1:22:54] and Paul said they didn't
[1:22:57] attain with all their
[1:22:59] efforts they did not attain because they
[1:23:02] sought it not by faith it didn't come by
[1:23:06] Revelation you see that's the only way
[1:23:08] you can know Christ is by
[1:23:11] Revelation and he said they stumbled at
[1:23:13] The Stumbling Stone as it is written I
[1:23:16] lay in Zion a stumbling Stone a rock of
[1:23:20] offense and whosoever believeth on him
[1:23:23] shall not be
[1:23:25] ashamed but the day when he
[1:23:28] Resurrection Jesus proved that he was a
[1:23:33] keystone to the Old Testament Church he
[1:23:36] was the finishing Stone and when he
[1:23:39] connected and tie to every scripture and
[1:23:42] fulfilled the Old Testaments the Saints
[1:23:45] rose with him in that Great Harvest Time
[1:23:49] that was a wonderful wonderful time of
[1:23:52] harvest don't you agree
[1:23:55] amen but in this lays a
[1:23:57] prophecy because God wasn't through
[1:24:01] harvesting he was going to get a people
[1:24:03] for his name's sake all through the Old
[1:24:06] Testament you would see that he would
[1:24:08] not only call Israel and make them his
[1:24:10] chosen people but he' also say I'm going
[1:24:13] to pour out my spirit on the
[1:24:15] Gentiles he began to give a little clues
[1:24:18] about what he would do because he wanted
[1:24:20] to be more than the god of the Jews he
[1:24:22] wanted to be the god of his people God
[1:24:25] so love the
[1:24:29] world so that day he rose he rose from
[1:24:32] the dead he proved he was the Keystone
[1:24:36] and the Saints rose with him in that
[1:24:37] Great Harvest Time and so it was
[1:24:41] prophesying that one day in another
[1:24:43] Harvest cycle that there will come a
[1:24:46] first fruit and the spirit will lift
[1:24:50] them up and wave them over the rest and
[1:24:53] there will be a resurrection of all the
[1:24:56] dead in Christ of the New Testament who
[1:24:59] will rise and Ascend together with the
[1:25:02] living and meet the Lord in the
[1:25:05] air now so first was The Barley Harvest
[1:25:10] seven weeks later was the wheed Harvest
[1:25:14] and The Barley represented the Jewish
[1:25:17] dispensation and the wheat represents
[1:25:20] the Gentile
[1:25:22] dispensation and and that disp
[1:25:24] that that Gentile dispensation would
[1:25:27] mature 7 weeks later and and have its
[1:25:32] celebration at
[1:25:34] Pentecost and and of course as I've been
[1:25:37] saying that types seven Church ages from
[1:25:40] the Passover Lamb of 2,000 years ago we
[1:25:44] have marked now seven weeks seven Church
[1:25:49] ages until we are now in another Harvest
[1:25:53] Time
[1:25:56] what a wonderful hour to be in it's a
[1:25:59] time of Plenty it's a time of
[1:26:02] Celebration Pentecost is a Greek word
[1:26:05] meaning 50 which was a which was the
[1:26:08] celebration of the Harvest it was
[1:26:11] 49 days at seven days in a week s weeks
[1:26:15] 7 7 49 on the 50th day Pentecost also
[1:26:20] known by the Jews today as shabat which
[1:26:23] is a thanksgiv given for the first
[1:26:25] fruits of the wheat Harvest and it it
[1:26:28] marked it marks the end of the wheat
[1:26:31] Harvest that all that we've been waiting
[1:26:34] on all the years of growth all the time
[1:26:38] since the seed was planted 2,000 years
[1:26:42] ago it's all coming to maturity now
[1:26:45] that's Hallelujah there it's a time of
[1:26:48] harvest and the Bible said Jesus
[1:26:51] explained the parable of the Harvest and
[1:26:53] he said the Harvest is the end of the
[1:26:55] world and the angels are the
[1:26:59] Reapers now the first Pentecost was
[1:27:02] established around the harvest season
[1:27:04] indicating God's plan to harvest people
[1:27:07] from every tribe in his kingdom so after
[1:27:11] the Passover where Jesus became the
[1:27:14] sacrificial lamb there started the
[1:27:17] countdown of the weeks one week two
[1:27:21] weeks three weeks four weeks down of the
[1:27:24] weeks until the day of Pentecost as I as
[1:27:28] I reiterate representing seven Church
[1:27:31] ages from Calvary now far from the
[1:27:35] Passover started the countdown and and
[1:27:39] it would go all the way to the day of
[1:27:41] Pentecost and when the day of Pentecost
[1:27:44] was fully come there God their God again
[1:27:50] waved over the people in the upper room
[1:27:53] the Holy Spirit and they were the first
[1:27:57] I want you to get the word first we're
[1:28:00] talking about first fruits amen they
[1:28:02] were the first of Adam's race who rose
[1:28:06] from the dead by being born
[1:28:09] again amen born of the word like they
[1:28:13] should have been at the
[1:28:15] beginning can you imagine what God was
[1:28:18] doing here for the first fruits of his
[1:28:22] resurrection would be on Pentecost yeah
[1:28:26] now we're not talking about from the
[1:28:27] dead that Jesus did that but we're
[1:28:30] talking about those who had died with
[1:28:34] Adam because of Adam's sin and we were
[1:28:38] born into death and for the first
[1:28:42] time listen even the disciples walked
[1:28:46] with Jesus and they worked miracles and
[1:28:48] did signs they did wonders and they
[1:28:51] believed on the Lord and and they they
[1:28:53] were they were Sanctified is he said I
[1:28:56] you're Sanctified through the words I
[1:28:58] speak and and all of this but he comes
[1:29:01] down to Pentecost and the for the first
[1:29:04] time ever sir men and women were born
[1:29:10] again amen the spirit of God
[1:29:13] descending come down like a rushing
[1:29:16] Mighty Wind a waving fire over a
[1:29:20] congregation and God waving over and
[1:29:23] took them as a first fruit that's right
[1:29:26] and he and when he takes the first fruit
[1:29:28] he is declaring every other one is going
[1:29:32] to come to maturity just like this
[1:29:35] one every other child of God that comes
[1:29:38] is going to get the Holy Ghost just like
[1:29:41] they got
[1:29:45] it
[1:29:48] Hallelujah
[1:29:50] now Adam we know brought us into a place
[1:29:55] of
[1:29:56] death but when the spirit of Jesus the
[1:29:58] Holy Ghost took up those raised up those
[1:30:02] first fruits in Acts two and raised them
[1:30:06] up out of sin's
[1:30:08] trespasses listen listen what did what
[1:30:11] happened at Pentecost God took a a Lon
[1:30:18] betraying
[1:30:20] Peter a cursing a cursing Peter come on
[1:30:24] somebody you read your Bible took that
[1:30:27] man there that was just a a a liar he
[1:30:31] was a a betrayer amen he was a a a
[1:30:36] deceiver all of these things cursing
[1:30:39] Peter and he took him and he transformed
[1:30:42] him right in the LA of God in his life
[1:30:46] and made him a Son of God I tell you
[1:30:49] that's what the new birth does to a
[1:30:50] person it takes the old life away and
[1:30:53] behold you are a new creation you look
[1:30:56] nothing like what you did in the past
[1:30:58] amen but you have been made a new in
[1:31:01] Christ
[1:31:02] Jesus
[1:31:04] Hallelujah so he took them on the day of
[1:31:06] Pentecost and lifted them up into life
[1:31:09] exalted those first fruits of the
[1:31:11] Harvest and waved them signifying there
[1:31:14] are more to come amen and I know there's
[1:31:18] more to come because I'm one of them to
[1:31:22] come Hallelujah amen it was a wave of
[1:31:25] the Holy Ghost it came like a sound from
[1:31:29] heaven like a rushing Mighty Wind and
[1:31:31] the first time ever men born by sexual
[1:31:35] birth born in sin were filled with the
[1:31:39] spirit oh you say well brother Tim John
[1:31:42] was filled from his mother's womb and
[1:31:44] there were others in the Old Testament
[1:31:46] filled with the spirit not like this the
[1:31:49] Bible is clear about this when he talks
[1:31:51] about how that it would come in a new
[1:31:53] way
[1:31:54] not as an anointing upon the person not
[1:31:58] as something that just gets upon the
[1:32:00] spirit of a man and he prophesies but
[1:32:03] something that changes the
[1:32:05] nature amen he he speaks of it and and
[1:32:08] he says if any man thirst let him come
[1:32:11] to me and drink and out of his belly
[1:32:14] shall flow shall flow rivers of living
[1:32:17] water out of his innermost being shall
[1:32:19] flow Rivers of Life Giving water
[1:32:26] this he spoke of the spirit which they
[1:32:29] had not yet received for it was not yet
[1:32:33] given
[1:32:35] now this is and I'm quoting you Bible
[1:32:38] when I talk when I'm speaking that so
[1:32:40] those was at Pentecost were a first
[1:32:43] fruit the first resurrected out of sin
[1:32:47] and death the first time that God
[1:32:51] tabernacled sinful man
[1:32:54] man now God had tabernacled a man before
[1:32:58] but he wasn't
[1:32:59] sinful that was Jesus born of the Virgin
[1:33:03] and God had come in Tabernacle to him
[1:33:05] but now through the shedding of the
[1:33:09] blood through the cleansing at Calvary
[1:33:13] he had so cleansed vessels that God
[1:33:16] could come and dwell in them you see as
[1:33:19] long as sin nature is in your life God
[1:33:22] can't come and dwell
[1:33:24] there that's why there always has to be
[1:33:26] a Dy out of the old man before a new one
[1:33:30] can be
[1:33:31] born you see God and Satan cannot rule
[1:33:35] in your heart at the same time you
[1:33:38] cannot love two
[1:33:40] masters you cannot serve two
[1:33:43] masters you will love one and hate the
[1:33:46] other the Bible said amen so therefore
[1:33:49] again as we're looking at this we know
[1:33:51] that Satan has to be th deth in the life
[1:33:55] and that's what real conversion is it is
[1:33:57] the dethroning and the casting out of
[1:34:00] Satan so Mark 16 said in my name they
[1:34:04] shall cast out
[1:34:07] devils and of course this is the worst
[1:34:09] of
[1:34:11] kind that of
[1:34:13] sin now those at Pentecost they were a
[1:34:18] first fruit they were the first
[1:34:21] resurrected but they Pentecost of 2,000
[1:34:25] years ago and this is what I want to get
[1:34:27] to you for us to see because you know if
[1:34:31] we're not careful we keep the Bible as
[1:34:34] something
[1:34:37] historical something that happened
[1:34:39] 200000 years ago something that God did
[1:34:42] back then and and somehow another you
[1:34:46] know it was then but not now but let me
[1:34:50] let me just uh tell you that they at
[1:34:52] Pentecost
[1:34:54] when they staggered out of the upper
[1:34:56] room under the influence of the Holy
[1:34:58] Ghost drunk or intoxicated with
[1:35:01] something they were calling new
[1:35:04] wine amen lives that were
[1:35:07] changed amen a lying curs Peter there
[1:35:12] changed amen changed there and now
[1:35:15] preaching the gospel and men and women
[1:35:18] giv glory to God in every
[1:35:22] language they were only
[1:35:25] typing they were only
[1:35:28] foreshadowing they were only
[1:35:31] prophesying of the end where once again
[1:35:35] at the final Harvest by the pouring out
[1:35:38] of God's spirit he will bring a bride
[1:35:40] Harvest people to maturity and wave them
[1:35:44] as the first fruits of the
[1:35:48] Harvest
[1:35:50] Hallelujah and why this is so wonderful
[1:35:54] is because just like as Jesus was the
[1:35:56] first fruit and brought with him the
[1:36:00] dead of the Old Testament this bride
[1:36:03] being the first
[1:36:05] fruits will bring with him the
[1:36:08] resurrection of all Seven
[1:36:12] Ages so let me recap for a moment so
[1:36:16] from the waving of the first fruits of
[1:36:18] the barley Harvest of the Old Testament
[1:36:20] Saints with Jesus Christ being the the
[1:36:23] first fruit of them that slept we begin
[1:36:26] to count down seven weeks representing
[1:36:29] 2,000 years of Gentile Church ages these
[1:36:32] are signified with seven golden
[1:36:34] lampstands this is the word of God it is
[1:36:36] shown symbolically in the Book of
[1:36:38] Revelation now remember the Book of
[1:36:40] Revelation is a is a book about end time
[1:36:44] and it is written in symbols because
[1:36:47] it's not until the end time is it
[1:36:49] supposed to be made known so because God
[1:36:52] will hold them blind in other ages
[1:36:55] making each one of them think that they
[1:36:58] were the ones who the Lord was coming
[1:37:00] for and he would hold it blind to the to
[1:37:03] each one of them because if they had
[1:37:05] known there had would be 2,000 more
[1:37:07] years or 1,500 more years or 700 more
[1:37:11] years or 300 more years they would have
[1:37:14] just been slothful Satan had done a lot
[1:37:17] damage with it that's right but God
[1:37:19] doesn't want you to know the day and
[1:37:21] hour of his coming
[1:37:24] we know
[1:37:26] it we do know it we know the exact day
[1:37:30] and hour we know the exact hour anyway
[1:37:32] of his
[1:37:34] coming is the hour you think
[1:37:38] not right that's when he'll come even
[1:37:42] naturally your death you don't know when
[1:37:44] it's going to be I I've said a lot of
[1:37:46] times you know when when when when I'm
[1:37:49] interrupted by somebody dying I said you
[1:37:51] know they they wasn't very C ious he
[1:37:53] could have given me a
[1:37:55] notice I'd like to have been able to
[1:37:57] mark it on my calendar made plans for
[1:37:59] this event but they just dropped it in
[1:38:01] suddenly because nobody
[1:38:04] knows and nobody's going to know when
[1:38:06] the Lord's
[1:38:09] coming but he come in the hour you think
[1:38:12] not so now but here again we can know by
[1:38:15] the signs around
[1:38:17] us and know by the scripture where we're
[1:38:22] at right that we are in the end time
[1:38:25] cycle that this is certainly a harvest
[1:38:28] season we can see the Bible said in Luke
[1:38:31] 17:30 as it was in the days of lot in
[1:38:35] the days of lot Sodom was known for his
[1:38:39] sodomites amen and there there they they
[1:38:43] they were was a righteous man by the
[1:38:46] name of lot who who whose Soul was vexed
[1:38:50] daily because of the evil
[1:38:53] amen so you see as it was in the days of
[1:38:56] lot so shall it be in the revealing of
[1:39:00] the son of man so here we are again in
[1:39:03] the days of lot we can see just before
[1:39:06] the fire
[1:39:07] burns and remember this is the next
[1:39:12] judgment somebody help me preach now
[1:39:15] amen first he baptized it with water in
[1:39:18] the days of Noah second he put his blood
[1:39:20] upon it and Sanctified the Earth with
[1:39:22] his blood 2,000 years ago and then
[1:39:25] finally what will he do he will burn it
[1:39:27] with
[1:39:32] fire so we know the next
[1:39:34] judgment and what an age we're living in
[1:39:38] where man has the power to destroy this
[1:39:40] Earth many times over never has there
[1:39:44] been a generation that's come to this
[1:39:47] hour and we're closer now to
[1:39:50] midnight than ever right
[1:39:56] now here now is where the day of
[1:40:00] Pentecost is fully come here's now is
[1:40:04] the Gentile Harvest The Barley Harvest
[1:40:07] is all complete for it's come to his
[1:40:09] head with Jesus and all the saints
[1:40:11] resurrected and raptured and now in this
[1:40:15] day in this day the the Gentile
[1:40:18] dispensation comes to the Harvest Time
[1:40:22] and the seven weeks are now completed
[1:40:25] the seventh Church age is at its
[1:40:28] end and it finally wipes winds up with
[1:40:32] the coming of The Headstone Christ who
[1:40:34] will be who will come in the literal
[1:40:37] physical form and that is the
[1:40:40] summit that is The Headstone that Grace
[1:40:43] is bringing it was grace that brought a
[1:40:46] savior 2,000 years ago and it's Grace
[1:40:49] that brings back the Savior to Rapture
[1:40:52] of Bride in the last
[1:40:54] day but first there is a spiritual
[1:40:58] forerunning of that literal event what
[1:41:01] literal event the second coming there
[1:41:04] has to be a spiritual forerunning of
[1:41:06] that to have a Rapture there has to be a
[1:41:09] people brought out of the tombs of
[1:41:12] religion and religious sin and unbelief
[1:41:15] and dead Works amen there has to come
[1:41:18] and there has to be a voice of God to
[1:41:21] call us out of Babylon
[1:41:23] remember in the in in zachariah's day
[1:41:26] they had they had been urged by the
[1:41:29] spirit it was something you know even
[1:41:31] Nehemiah he could not do anything but
[1:41:34] weep because as he thought about
[1:41:37] Jerusalem and the need for restoration
[1:41:40] and they become a drive in their hearts
[1:41:43] 70 years had passed since they had been
[1:41:46] taken Exile and they had now their homes
[1:41:49] in Babylon they were they had their
[1:41:51] their um IND Ministry there the
[1:41:54] synagogues and everything there was in
[1:41:56] Babylon but there was something in the
[1:41:58] hearts of men and women began to yearn I
[1:42:02] want to go
[1:42:06] home I don't know how you feel this
[1:42:08] morning but that ought to be the desire
[1:42:11] of every heart
[1:42:12] today amen I want to leave this Babylon
[1:42:15] I want to go home I want to go back to
[1:42:18] the promised land where we
[1:42:21] belong we don't belong
[1:42:24] here so there's this first spiritual
[1:42:27] forerunning of the literal event where
[1:42:30] we will know see Christ as we meet him
[1:42:33] in the air and to have a Rapture there
[1:42:36] has to be a people as as it brought out
[1:42:38] the tombs of religion of sin dead works
[1:42:42] and the call is come out of
[1:42:45] Babylon so let's go to Revelation
[1:42:48] chapter 18 and verse one and I'm going
[1:42:50] to show you in the prophecy
[1:42:54] after these things I saw another Angel
[1:42:56] come down from heaven having great power
[1:42:58] and the Earth was lighten with his glory
[1:43:00] so here comes a messenger and his earth
[1:43:03] the earth is lightened with his glory
[1:43:04] and he cries mightily with a strong
[1:43:07] voice saying Babylon the greatest Fallen
[1:43:09] is fallen and has become the habitation
[1:43:11] of devil the hold of every false Spirit
[1:43:14] the cage of every unclean and hateful
[1:43:16] bird think about that this is this
[1:43:20] becomes the state of even religion to
[1:43:24] today the hold whereever foul Spirit
[1:43:28] comes together why you talking like that
[1:43:30] because too many people have
[1:43:33] religion and are never
[1:43:36] changed and they sit in the church or
[1:43:39] come to the church and yet and still
[1:43:41] with every kind of sin in their lives
[1:43:44] unbelief that has never been repented of
[1:43:47] and and they continue right on in their
[1:43:50] sins right brother the gospel is about
[1:43:54] changing your
[1:43:56] life amen not not ex you know we've sang
[1:43:59] the song Just as I am until we think
[1:44:02] that God's going to accept us that way
[1:44:04] and leave us that way no God will allow
[1:44:06] you to come just the way you are don't
[1:44:08] you don't have to clean yourself up to
[1:44:10] come amen but you do have to
[1:44:14] repent he'll clean you up am man you
[1:44:17] know sometimes I I I look and I see
[1:44:20] people that I know their lives are in
[1:44:22] sybles and I don't worry about cleaning
[1:44:24] them up I know that the gospel going
[1:44:27] forth and power will clean that life I
[1:44:31] don't have to do it I don't have to
[1:44:33] reform them it'll come by a new
[1:44:36] birth and they'll be
[1:44:41] changed so he's here he says come out of
[1:44:45] her my people look at look at verse um
[1:44:48] three now and it said for all nations
[1:44:52] have drunk of the the wrath of her
[1:44:53] fornication and the kings of the earth
[1:44:56] committed fornication with her and the
[1:44:58] merchants of the Earth are wax Rich
[1:45:00] through the abundance of her dely and I
[1:45:02] heard another voice from Heaven saying
[1:45:04] come out of her my people that you be
[1:45:08] not partakers of her sins and that you
[1:45:10] receive not out of her plag for her sins
[1:45:13] have reached to heaven and God has
[1:45:15] remembered her
[1:45:18] iniquities and from there she'll be cast
[1:45:20] into tribulation
[1:45:23] and there are the plagues poured out
[1:45:25] upon
[1:45:26] her this is this is Mr Babin now come
[1:45:30] out of come out and go
[1:45:34] where back to the
[1:45:37] Homeland come on come back to the
[1:45:39] homeland of the
[1:45:41] Bible back to where the book is unsealed
[1:45:44] and
[1:45:47] opened back to where the truths are no
[1:45:50] longer a mystery
[1:45:53] yeah or some forgotten
[1:45:55] beatitude amen but but where the word
[1:45:59] has been unsealed and open now the work
[1:46:03] of redemption is in a three-fold manner
[1:46:07] now I won't be able to talk about them
[1:46:09] all today but I want to get to just kind
[1:46:11] of give you an overview because it is
[1:46:14] the work of redemption is completed in a
[1:46:16] three-fold manner the The Headstone must
[1:46:19] come to each each one of them must have
[1:46:22] a headstone Stone now first there has to
[1:46:25] be the finishing stone that is the
[1:46:29] capping off of the mysteries of God that
[1:46:32] restores the church to back it was what
[1:46:35] it was before it went down to
[1:46:39] Babylon now all you have to do is study
[1:46:42] church history and you will know that
[1:46:45] from from uh from the um book of Acts
[1:46:51] and that early church that there came a
[1:46:55] dispersal and and so there there was the
[1:46:58] a dispora as it was where they were
[1:47:00] dispersed and now there here it they go
[1:47:04] out down into
[1:47:07] Babylon they're out of the homeland of
[1:47:09] the
[1:47:10] Bible and so again down there you know
[1:47:15] they they're in among the Nations and
[1:47:18] you will find them in all nations
[1:47:20] whether it's the denomination of
[1:47:23] Catholicism or the denominations of
[1:47:26] protestantism doesn't matter the name of
[1:47:29] it they they're all down in Babylon
[1:47:32] scattered among the Nations and so
[1:47:35] Against All Odds and incredible as it
[1:47:38] may seem and as insurmountable as the
[1:47:42] mountain is for is sealed and I'm
[1:47:45] talking about the mysteries of God
[1:47:47] sealed with seven Thunders and no
[1:47:50] Theologian can guess accurately what
[1:47:52] they are
[1:47:53] so it will not be by man's might nor by
[1:47:57] his power but by my spirit sayith the
[1:48:01] Lord and it will require a prophet and
[1:48:04] is One Promise yes at the end of the Old
[1:48:07] Testament God promis a time of
[1:48:10] restoration he tells us before the world
[1:48:13] Burns as an oven and the righteous walk
[1:48:16] out on the ashes of the wicked before
[1:48:19] that coming behold I'm going to send to
[1:48:21] you Elijah the prophet amen Elijah was a
[1:48:26] restorer amen he would build up the
[1:48:29] temples uh the the old Altar and and he
[1:48:32] would bring him to a showdown on Mount
[1:48:34] Carmel and he would build up the old
[1:48:37] altar Gathering the stones and neglected
[1:48:39] stones and would place them back in
[1:48:43] together and make a place of worship and
[1:48:45] then put the sacrifice the Lamb on top
[1:48:47] of it and then God would send the fire
[1:48:51] down so you see Elijah is a restoring
[1:48:55] prophet and God promises in the last day
[1:48:58] he will send one the spirit and the
[1:48:59] power of Elijah a forerunner of the
[1:49:02] coming word and power one like Elijah
[1:49:06] who restored Israel uh from Jezebel and
[1:49:09] called them out to be to come out of her
[1:49:12] and the curses came down upon ahab's
[1:49:14] Kingdom and brought them back to the
[1:49:17] true worship of
[1:49:19] Jehovah so that is the first thing God
[1:49:22] will finish the
[1:49:26] Mysteries so second The Headstone of
[1:49:30] Salvation now this is the second one we
[1:49:32] want to talk about for you are the
[1:49:35] Temple of the Holy
[1:49:40] Ghost but what God good is a building
[1:49:43] without God in
[1:49:46] it you are to be the dwelling place of
[1:49:50] God but I wonder if if the veil is open
[1:49:54] and see on the inside of many Christians
[1:49:57] is there any God
[1:50:01] there this is really important God must
[1:50:04] be there it's one thing to be a
[1:50:07] religious Temple it's one thing to have
[1:50:10] a facade and a sign upon you but it's
[1:50:14] another thing for God to dwell on the
[1:50:16] inside so you are the Temple of the Holy
[1:50:19] Ghost and look the church is the temple
[1:50:23] of the Holy Ghost and and some parts may
[1:50:26] have been restored to Luther and Wesley
[1:50:28] more power in isus the street but it
[1:50:31] comes in our day where the finishing
[1:50:33] stone is brought forth the fullness of
[1:50:36] the spirit poured out not simply
[1:50:40] justified by faith or not simply
[1:50:43] Sanctified by Grace or not just
[1:50:46] empowered by the spirit but the person
[1:50:48] of Christ himself Christ must be The
[1:50:53] Headstone of every man woman boy or girl
[1:50:58] amen he is the stone that the builders
[1:51:00] dis allowed but to us he is
[1:51:04] precious Hallelujah and when he comes in
[1:51:07] the light it comes with much
[1:51:10] rejoicing Hallelujah because it's Grace
[1:51:13] Grace coming down on the life when God
[1:51:16] caps you off with the finishing Stone of
[1:51:20] the Holy Ghost and there may be
[1:51:23] mountains of sin in your life and
[1:51:25] mountains of unbelief there but I'll
[1:51:27] Tell You by my spirit sayith the Lord
[1:51:30] that mountain will be removed and The
[1:51:32] Headstone will come crying Grace
[1:51:38] Grace third Redemption is not
[1:51:42] finished without bringing the headstone
[1:51:45] Jesus Christ and a literal physical
[1:51:49] body with the meeting in the air
[1:51:53] that is the hope of the
[1:51:56] ages
[1:51:58] now but
[1:52:00] first the original and fullness of the
[1:52:03] word has to come down in order to bring
[1:52:06] the fullness of the spirit and
[1:52:09] power now surely you can see what we're
[1:52:12] talking about this morning cuz for the
[1:52:15] first time for the bright age for
[1:52:18] Resurrection out of dark
[1:52:20] denominationalism is a message that the
[1:52:23] full maturity of the word has returned
[1:52:25] back in power and is being waved over
[1:52:28] the people again by the same signs and
[1:52:30] wonders that he did there because I live
[1:52:33] ye shall live also that's what he said
[1:52:36] to his wife the bride amen what a
[1:52:38] resurrection that was but what a
[1:52:40] resurrection this is amen not only that
[1:52:44] let me tell you you you you know Christ
[1:52:47] is no more in the Tomb and he cannot be
[1:52:50] sealed there no matter what you do and
[1:52:52] his bride cannot be sealed in the tombs
[1:52:55] of religion come on somebody amen you
[1:52:59] broke out of a Baptist tomb a Methodist
[1:53:01] tomb a Catholic tomb or whatever but you
[1:53:04] broke out of that broke the seals of
[1:53:07] death and we are not any longer dead but
[1:53:11] we are alive forever more and we not go
[1:53:14] back to be in another denomination again
[1:53:17] a work of
[1:53:21] man cuz God never ordained one of
[1:53:25] them
[1:53:26] amen so he was waved to him the word to
[1:53:30] them the word which he was waved to them
[1:53:32] on the day of Pentecost the word made
[1:53:34] manifest I want you to get it the word
[1:53:37] was waved on the day of
[1:53:41] Pentecost and the Word was
[1:53:46] Spirit and the same holy ghost that came
[1:53:50] in Acts 2 is poured out again in the
[1:53:53] evening time Harvest of the Gentile
[1:53:56] dispensation Joel chapter 2 says in the
[1:53:59] last days I will pour out my spirit upon
[1:54:03] All
[1:54:05] Flesh this is shown also in Revelation
[1:54:10] 10 you see God had a mature elect bride
[1:54:14] in the beginning there in Acts he must
[1:54:17] have a mature m Bride In the End she
[1:54:21] goes from as the wheat plant from seed
[1:54:25] to seed both were Harvest
[1:54:28] times the Alpha and Omega
[1:54:32] bride now if you look with me in Mark 4
[1:54:37] verse
[1:54:38] 26 and Jesus says now the kingdom of
[1:54:43] God and so let me just translate that
[1:54:45] for you so is the Holy
[1:54:50] Ghost so is the kingdom of God so is the
[1:54:53] Holy
[1:54:55] Ghost somebody help me now get your
[1:54:59] thinking caps on because the kingdom of
[1:55:01] God is the Holy Ghost it's where God is
[1:55:05] King if the kingdom comes in your heart
[1:55:08] in life that's where Jesus is Lord where
[1:55:11] God is King somebody help me preach and
[1:55:14] so is the kingdom of God so is the Holy
[1:55:17] Ghost here in the realm of the Holy
[1:55:20] Ghost as is as a man should cast seed
[1:55:25] into the ground and he should sleep and
[1:55:27] Rise day and night and the seed should
[1:55:29] spring up and grow up and he knoweth not
[1:55:32] how but the Earth bringeth forth fruit
[1:55:34] of herself first the blade then the ear
[1:55:36] and after that the full corn in the
[1:55:39] ear but when the fruit is brought forth
[1:55:43] immediately he putteth in the sickle
[1:55:45] because the Harvest has come so Jesus
[1:55:48] tells us right here this is what the
[1:55:50] Holy Ghost the kingdom of the Holy Ghost
[1:55:52] ghost is going to do it's going to be as
[1:55:54] a man planting a seed I'm in this in
[1:55:58] this dispensation of the Holy goes I'm
[1:56:00] going to plant a
[1:56:03] seed and as men
[1:56:06] sleep one generation dies and another
[1:56:09] comes and another generation dies and
[1:56:12] another comes as men sleep and Rise day
[1:56:15] and night the seed Will Spring forth and
[1:56:18] it will
[1:56:20] grow it's going to start heading back to
[1:56:24] to coming back to the head again to The
[1:56:28] Headstone to the
[1:56:29] Grain and then he said it will come
[1:56:32] first the blade and then the ear and
[1:56:37] then after that the full corn in the
[1:56:41] ear and when the fruit is brought forth
[1:56:45] immediately he put it in the sickle
[1:56:48] because the Harvest has come and the the
[1:56:51] putting in the sickle is the rapture
[1:56:54] that's
[1:56:55] right now so he says okay so what's
[1:56:59] going to happen Jesus said I'm going to
[1:57:02] plant a
[1:57:03] seed I'm going to start with the seed
[1:57:06] and I'm going to end with the seed I
[1:57:09] will have Alpha and I will have
[1:57:11] omega now in between is going to be a
[1:57:14] growth
[1:57:15] period it's going to die it'll rot it'll
[1:57:18] lose it it's what it had it'll go down
[1:57:21] into Darkness but it's going to come up
[1:57:24] and when it comes up it's going to go
[1:57:26] through stages of growth and there will
[1:57:28] be again and he brings forth the blade
[1:57:32] and then the ear which is the chaff or
[1:57:36] the
[1:57:37] Shu and then the full
[1:57:40] corn in the ear and when I get to the
[1:57:44] full
[1:57:45] corn when it comes back to grain again
[1:57:49] there's going to be a rapture
[1:57:56] Hallelujah
[1:57:58] thus Revelation chapter 10 is our
[1:58:02] Pentecost it is the coming of Christ the
[1:58:05] Holy Ghost returning in power not a
[1:58:09] portion but the fullness of the spirit
[1:58:12] let me this just for reference give me

[1:58:29] in parabolic
[1:58:31] form and and it's but because it's it's
[1:58:34] left there to for people of other ages

[1:58:49] messenger I saw another mighty the angel

[1:58:57] cloud Jesus said behold I come with
[1:59:00] clouds clothed with a cloud and Let Me
[1:59:03] Tell You Through the Ages he has been
[1:59:06] clouded
[1:59:08] over and Through the Ages we've only
[1:59:11] looked at him through the as I said
[1:59:13] through the lattice through the
[1:59:16] tipes and look he was clothed with the
[1:59:18] cloud a rainbow was up on his head and a
[1:59:21] rain
[1:59:22] is symbolic of the full
[1:59:24] Covenant with the seven colors of the
[1:59:28] rainbow amen it wasn't it wasn't to
[1:59:31] represent the the LGBT movement it was
[1:59:34] it was the rainbow was up on his
[1:59:37] head amen it is the Covenant of God the
[1:59:42] Covenant Angel the angel of the Covenant
[1:59:44] it is Christ

[1:59:49] Jesus not the physical body
[1:59:52] but the spirit of
[1:59:54] Jesus Amen coming down and he his own
[1:59:58] messenger look and a rainbow is up on
[2:00:01] his head and his face was as the sun
[2:00:06] full light no
[2:00:12] Darkness I want you to get it it's the
[2:00:15] word coming in power that's right it's
[2:00:19] the word coming with no shadow over it
[2:00:23] it's the Mysteries revealed and his feet
[2:00:27] was as pillars of fire and there's only
[2:00:30] one place in the Bible where that is
[2:00:33] where it speaks about his feet and his
[2:00:36] feet the Bible said is a church he had
[2:00:38] put all things he made him to be head of
[2:00:41] the church and put all things under his
[2:00:43] feet which is his body the church that
[2:00:48] fth all and all and there on the day of
[2:00:51] Pentecost we didn't see a pillar of fire
[2:00:54] there's a pillar of fire in a burning
[2:00:55] bush there was a pillar of fire leading
[2:00:58] Egypt but there on that day of Pentecost
[2:01:00] he was not a pillar of fire but God
[2:01:02] divided himself as pillars of
[2:01:06] fire amen the lick of fire was was given
[2:01:10] birth offsprings of himself sons of God
[2:01:13] being born out of the same Light Of
[2:01:16] Glory the same power the same Holy
[2:01:19] Spirit and his feet were where he
[2:01:22] touches the Earth where he walks today
[2:01:25] is in a body called a bride amen and
[2:01:28] they are as pillars of fire they are God
[2:01:31] In Action upon the
[2:01:34] [Applause]
[2:01:38] Earth pillars of
[2:01:40] fire give me the next
[2:01:43] verse and he had in his hand not a
[2:01:46] closed book it was closed in Revelation
[2:01:50] 5 but in Revelation 10 he been opened
[2:01:54] seals removed Mysteries revealed and he
[2:01:58] had in his hand a book open and he sets
[2:02:01] his foot upon the land and on the
[2:02:07] sea upon the sea and his left foot on
[2:02:11] the
[2:02:12] earth now I want you to get this for a
[2:02:15] minute because what you are
[2:02:18] seeing in Revelation 10 is a symbol IC
[2:02:23] representation of the descending of the
[2:02:25] spirit in the end time bringing the Holy
[2:02:29] Ghost in his fullness say both word and
[2:02:31] spirit as it was at
[2:02:34] Pentecost so let me stop just a minute
[2:02:37] and look at this give me that verse
[2:02:39] before verse two he had in his hand a
[2:02:43] little book open and he set his right
[2:02:47] foot on the sea and his left foot on the
[2:02:50] Earth this is not a two mile high
[2:02:56] Jesus this is not some huge gigantic
[2:03:02] God this is
[2:03:04] symbolic of what he is doing footsteps
[2:03:08] are
[2:03:10] possession if everything is under his
[2:03:12] feet I want you to understand every
[2:03:14] devil is
[2:03:15] under your
[2:03:17] feet even if you're just a
[2:03:20] skin even if the bottom of the bottom of
[2:03:23] his feet if you're part of the body this
[2:03:24] morning every devil every spirit is
[2:03:28] under your feet and here in the Bible
[2:03:32] there was those those was a beast that
[2:03:35] rose up out of the sea well the Bible's
[2:03:37] clear rose up out of the water he said
[2:03:40] it was multitudes Nations tongues and
[2:03:42] people amen it was a populous place it
[2:03:46] rose up you can read the Bible it
[2:03:48] describes it as a a city that sits on
[2:03:50] Seven Hills it's a Beast with with with
[2:03:53] with with seven um that with seven horns
[2:03:57] and all all of these symbologies there
[2:03:59] is
[2:04:02] describing it describes it and it only
[2:04:04] even describes the one writing on her on
[2:04:07] it is a woman a
[2:04:10] prostitute why in the world are we
[2:04:12] talking about prostitutes in the Book of
[2:04:14] Revelation because a church
[2:04:17] prostituted the
[2:04:19] word and gave over to m other men rather
[2:04:22] than Christ himself and they made
[2:04:25] daughters like
[2:04:27] them so she's a mother of
[2:04:30] harlots yes and I want you to look
[2:04:34] here there's this power a beast is a
[2:04:37] power it rises out of the sea out of
[2:04:40] there comes
[2:04:41] Rome with all her
[2:04:44] catechisms her misinterpretations of the
[2:04:47] scripture I'm not talking about Catholic
[2:04:49] people they're good Catholic people
[2:04:51] there are nice wonderful Catholic people
[2:04:53] we're not talking about that we're
[2:04:54] talking about the
[2:04:56] system are you with me amen I'm not I'm
[2:04:59] not disparaging any of them I'm talking
[2:05:01] about the
[2:05:03] system amen but look I want you to know
[2:05:06] he did what he put your
[2:05:09] foot on the very head of the Beast
[2:05:13] itself rising up out of the sea amen and
[2:05:17] let me tell you you're no longer
[2:05:20] affected by the power of Rome you no
[2:05:23] longer worship her Pope you no longer
[2:05:26] bow to her her goddess to Mary you know
[2:05:29] no longer come on Church you no longer
[2:05:32] are are have her patron saints you no
[2:05:35] longer worship the dead you no longer
[2:05:38] pray to Spirits you know who God is why
[2:05:42] God put your foot on the very doctrines
[2:05:46] of
[2:05:47] Rome and gave you
[2:05:49] possession but what about our the land
[2:05:52] well out of the land is where there is
[2:05:54] no
[2:05:55] people which was
[2:05:58] America and God is also giv you power
[2:06:01] over the American
[2:06:02] Spirit listen you do not have to bow to
[2:06:05] the gods of
[2:06:08] Hollywood come on Amen America's gods
[2:06:11] are not our God Amen her Idols are not
[2:06:14] don't belong to us we worship none of
[2:06:16] them Idols why because by the Holy
[2:06:19] Spirit he has give you power yeah To
[2:06:22] Tread on serpents and scorpions and
[2:06:24] nothing shall by any means harm you amen
[2:06:28] so he put his his right foot on the sea
[2:06:30] his left foot upon the earth and the
[2:06:32] next verse and he cried with a loud
[2:06:35] voice he shouted and this is a part of
[2:06:38] his coming in the last day for he
[2:06:40] descends from heaven with a shout and
[2:06:44] when in his shout seven Thunders uttered
[2:06:47] their
[2:06:48] voices
[2:06:50] now what we are seeing in Revelation 10
[2:06:53] is symbolic representation of the
[2:06:56] descending of the holy
[2:07:00] spirit that happens at the end time and
[2:07:04] I want you to understand it brings the
[2:07:06] holy spirit in fullness is both word and
[2:07:09] spirit as it was at
[2:07:12] Pentecost now let me declare plainly it
[2:07:15] to your ears today that the word that
[2:07:18] Paul
[2:07:19] preached came as a
[2:07:22] direct came as a result of a direct
[2:07:25] outpouring of the spirit of Truth at
[2:07:29] Pentecost now so out of the outpouring
[2:07:33] of the Holy Spirit the word came through
[2:07:37] a prophet now let me tell you again and
[2:07:40] reassure you what came down at Pentecost
[2:07:43] was the cleared deed the open book it
[2:07:47] was not sealed
[2:07:51] now this is where the confusion comes
[2:07:53] because you get over here in Revelation
[2:07:54] and it's sealed well you know that must
[2:07:56] have been sealed in Paul's day well then
[2:07:58] why are we going back to the original
[2:08:00] and preaching what Paul preached when
[2:08:01] when the book was
[2:08:03] sealed it wasn't sealed to
[2:08:06] Paul it was an open book now Paul made
[2:08:10] some declarations I'm going to go
[2:08:11] through this for the next half an hour
[2:08:13] so hold on your
[2:08:15] seats Paul made some declaration and he
[2:08:18] says now in first Thessalonians 15 Our
[2:08:23] Gospel came not into you in word only
[2:08:26] now you said I'm bringing you
[2:08:29] word I'm bringing you word I'm teaching
[2:08:31] you predestination security of the
[2:08:34] believer I'm teaching you uh you know
[2:08:37] about about all of the different things
[2:08:40] separating law From Grace I'm doing all
[2:08:43] of this but I said Our Gospel didn't
[2:08:45] come to you just in word only it wasn't
[2:08:48] just a Doctrine but also in power yeah
[2:08:51] so where's he pointing back to
[2:08:54] Pentecost amen and then the Holy Ghost
[2:08:57] and with much Assurance as you might
[2:09:00] know what manner of men we were among
[2:09:01] you for your sakes now he tell you in 1
[2:09:05] Corinthians 2 and 4 he said and my
[2:09:07] speech and my preaching was not with
[2:09:10] enticing words of man's Wisdom but in
[2:09:14] demonstration of the spirit and
[2:09:17] power he wanted them to see the word is
[2:09:21] not just a a theory it's not a theology
[2:09:24] it's a power and he said that your faith
[2:09:28] should not stand in the wisdom of man
[2:09:31] but in the power of God how be it we
[2:09:35] speak wisdom among them that are perfect
[2:09:37] yet not the wisdom of this world nor the
[2:09:40] the princes of this world but that that
[2:09:43] come to not but we speak wisdom of God
[2:09:45] in a mystery even the hidden wisdom
[2:09:48] which God ordained before the world unto
[2:09:51] our Glory look he said there were things
[2:09:53] God
[2:09:54] hid and God kept from the
[2:09:57] others but now you know has now God has
[2:10:01] ordained it that it would be revealed
[2:10:05] this hidden wisdom because there was
[2:10:07] hidden wisdom in Abraham's life there
[2:10:10] was hidden wisdom in Esther there was
[2:10:13] hidden wisdom in Ruth there was hidden
[2:10:16] wisdom in Solomon all of this was hidden
[2:10:19] wisdom of God that was written in the
[2:10:21] tipes and it was all
[2:10:25] symbology and the Jews ought took it as
[2:10:28] literal and so he said in verse 8 he
[2:10:32] said which none of the princes of this
[2:10:35] world known cuz it knew cuz that they
[2:10:37] known it they would not have crucified
[2:10:40] the Lord Of Glory it's it was such a
[2:10:42] dark time
[2:10:45] spiritually to the church world it was
[2:10:47] going into darkness the Jewish
[2:10:49] dispensation was dying their light was
[2:10:52] going out blindness was upon the people
[2:10:55] do you know it happens with the Gentiles
[2:10:57] in the same way and Le O TOA they
[2:11:00] prophesied to be
[2:11:02] blind
[2:11:04] but as it is written I have not seen nor
[2:11:07] ear heard neither entered into the heart
[2:11:09] of man the things which God had prepared
[2:11:11] for them that love him you know he would
[2:11:12] say Abraham didn't realize it he didn't
[2:11:15] know he didn't understand what he was
[2:11:18] typing out he didn't understand abble
[2:11:21] did didn't know when he when he pulled
[2:11:23] up a w woolly lamb that there was coming
[2:11:25] another lamb of God he was just
[2:11:28] operating by
[2:11:31] Faith by Revelation he was told you know
[2:11:34] take a lamb offer its blood he didn't
[2:11:36] know that there would be thousands of
[2:11:39] years later the real lamb
[2:11:41] come right so he says he said I have not
[2:11:46] seen ear not heard they didn't know in
[2:11:49] other words they didn't know it never
[2:11:52] entered in the heart of man the things
[2:11:54] that God prepared for them that love you
[2:11:57] but God ha
[2:12:00] revealed them unto
[2:12:02] us this hidden wisdom this knowledge
[2:12:07] this understanding as he would separate
[2:12:10] Love From
[2:12:12] Grace God revealed them to us by his
[2:12:15] spirit for the spirit searches all
[2:12:17] things yay the Deep things of God well
[2:12:20] sometimes today we want to come along
[2:12:22] and say well praise God in this message
[2:12:24] we got something new we got something
[2:12:26] different from old Paul bless God we're
[2:12:28] we're we're a lot better off than any
[2:12:30] other age let me tell you something you
[2:12:33] got something a little wrong there can
[2:12:36] be no other
[2:12:43] gospel this is where we got into the
[2:12:45] mess we're in is because we preached
[2:12:47] another Jesus and another gospel
[2:12:51] right there can be no other
[2:12:55] gospel God will judge the World by Jesus
[2:13:01] Christ as Paul said according to my
[2:13:04] gospel and that's Romans 21:16 put that
[2:13:07] up he's not going to he's not going to
[2:13:09] he's not going to judge the World by the
[2:13:11] Baptists the methodists the Presbyterian
[2:13:13] the Catholics or or even in light
[2:13:15] Tabernacle he will judge the World by
[2:13:18] Jesus Christ when he judges is the
[2:13:21] secrets of Man by Jesus Christ according
[2:13:25] to my gospel so everybody will be God to
[2:13:29] judge according to the gospel of Paul
[2:13:31] that Jesus he preached that's
[2:13:36] right now let's go on down a little
[2:13:39] further Galatians
[2:13:41] 1:10 for
[2:13:43] now do I now persuade men or God or do I
[2:13:48] seek to please men for if I that please
[2:13:51] men I should not be the servant of
[2:13:54] Christ said if I'm a man pleaser I'm not
[2:13:56] Christ servant that's true with every
[2:13:59] Pastor if he's a man pleaser he's not a
[2:14:02] servant of
[2:14:03] Christ but I certify you Brethren that
[2:14:07] the gospel which was preached to me is
[2:14:10] not after
[2:14:12] man for I neither received it of man
[2:14:17] neither was I taught it but by the RO
[2:14:22] revelation of Jesus
[2:14:25] Christ amen now this is a really the
[2:14:28] definition of ever God called
[2:14:31] man amen I didn't receive it of man
[2:14:33] neither was I taught it but by
[2:14:35] revelation of Jesus Christ for you have
[2:14:37] heard in my conversation but means my
[2:14:40] past life in Times past the Jewish
[2:14:42] religion how that beyond measure I
[2:14:44] persecuted the Church of God and wasted
[2:14:46] it and profited in the Jews religion
[2:14:48] among many of my equals in my own Nation
[2:14:51] being more exceedingly zealous of the
[2:14:53] traditions of my fathers he was really
[2:14:57] religious this was a great
[2:15:00] denominational God from the Pharisees
[2:15:02] representing their denomination well
[2:15:05] amen and was
[2:15:08] zealous don't don't mistake zealousness
[2:15:11] for the Holy Spirit that's right come on
[2:15:16] but watch when it please
[2:15:18] God you know said when it pleased God
[2:15:22] who separated me from my mother's womb
[2:15:24] and called me by his grace you know
[2:15:26] that's when it happens to every person
[2:15:28] every person has that time in their
[2:15:32] life amen Jason tager you was raised on
[2:15:37] a church pew you went to church you
[2:15:41] heard the messages you would even say I
[2:15:43] believed it and all of that but whatever
[2:15:46] you got whatever you had wouldn't keep
[2:15:48] you and out in the world you went to
[2:15:50] every kind of sorted life right but when
[2:15:53] it pleased
[2:15:55] God that was a Divine appointment for
[2:15:57] your life amen when it pleased God who
[2:16:01] separated me from my mother's womb you
[2:16:03] know what happened when the word went
[2:16:05] forth the drugs went the alcohol went to
[2:16:08] Tobacco went it all
[2:16:10] went Hallelujah That's The Power of this
[2:16:13] Christ when it please God who separated
[2:16:16] me from my mother's womb and called me
[2:16:19] by his grace to reveal K his son in me
[2:16:23] that I might preach him among the
[2:16:24] Heathen immediately immediately I
[2:16:27] conferred not with flesh and blood
[2:16:30] neither when I went up to Jerusalem to
[2:16:32] them which were Apostles before me but I
[2:16:34] went into Arabia and returned again
[2:16:37] under Damascus and after three years I
[2:16:39] went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and
[2:16:41] Abode with him 15 days he's and he's
[2:16:43] just showing he said I got this what I
[2:16:47] received I didn't get it from man
[2:16:52] I'm not even preaching what Peter told
[2:16:54] me to
[2:16:55] preach it was revealed to
[2:16:58] me and he said another the other
[2:17:00] Apostles I saw none say James the Lord's
[2:17:04] brother and these things which I WR un
[2:17:05] you behold before God I lie not
[2:17:08] afterwards I'll come into the regions of
[2:17:10] Syria Andia and and there was a known by
[2:17:15] face and to the churches of Judea which
[2:17:17] were in um Christ but they had they had
[2:17:23] heard only that he which persecuted Us
[2:17:25] in past times now preaches of Faith
[2:17:27] which he once destroyed and they
[2:17:29] glorified god in me so he said I didn't
[2:17:31] get
[2:17:34] this I got this from the outpouring of
[2:17:36] the
[2:17:38] spirit what happened at Pentecost came
[2:17:41] into me and when it came into me it
[2:17:45] revealed the
[2:17:46] word now you you might protest but the
[2:17:50] book of The Plan of Redemption has been
[2:17:52] hid and sealed up from since the
[2:17:55] foundational world and and I just say
[2:17:57] that's a valid
[2:17:59] point the Old Testaments would get
[2:18:01] prophets they would get a glimpse of it
[2:18:04] and they would prophesy of it but yet it
[2:18:06] was not made
[2:18:08] known you know I've often thought about
[2:18:11] that day when when Isaiah was
[2:18:13] prophesying by the spirit and they the
[2:18:18] man wanted to the king wanted a sign to
[2:18:21] know that he was to do a certain certain
[2:18:23] thing it comes out of his mouth he comes
[2:18:25] rolling out I'll give you a sign as he
[2:18:27] gets under the inspiration I'll give you
[2:18:29] a sign Behold a virgin shall
[2:18:33] conceive and bring forth a son what a a
[2:18:36] virgin someone that don't know a man
[2:18:38] will conceive and you know that doesn't
[2:18:40] know a man what come on I I imagine he
[2:18:42] want to step those words back in his
[2:18:44] mouth but God had taken him over and he
[2:18:46] began to prophesy of a sign that the
[2:18:50] Israel would look
[2:18:51] for that would happen 700 years
[2:18:56] later I want you to see this they get a
[2:19:00] glimpse so they prophesy he'll come to a
[2:19:03] virgin it be a son is given his name
[2:19:05] will be called wonderful counselor he'll
[2:19:08] be the Mighty God the Prince of Peace
[2:19:11] he'll be the Everlasting father of his
[2:19:14] government and his rule there be no
[2:19:17] end that's Isaiah 9 and6 so he see so
[2:19:21] the Old Testament prophets would get a
[2:19:22] glimpse of him but I want you to look um
[2:19:26] in Romans
[2:19:28] 16:25 now to him that is a power to
[2:19:31] establish you according to my
[2:19:35] gospel watch how Paul does it my
[2:19:39] gospel that's the way we ought to look
[2:19:41] at the word is mine and Paul said this
[2:19:44] is my gospel and the preaching of Jesus
[2:19:49] Christ according to the revelation of
[2:19:51] the mystery which was Kept Secret since
[2:19:55] the world
[2:19:57] began I am preaching to you things that
[2:20:01] were
[2:20:03] secret that none of the other ages knew
[2:20:07] that had they known it this wisdom they
[2:20:10] would not have crucified the Lord Of
[2:20:12] Glory but look here I am preaching to
[2:20:15] you the revelation of the mystery which
[2:20:18] was Kept Secret yes sir
[2:20:21] yes since the world
[2:20:25] began so Paul is
[2:20:28] preaching
[2:20:30] secrets that had been kept or shall I
[2:20:34] use the word
[2:20:36] sealed from other
[2:20:40] ages but I want you to look but is now
[2:20:44] made manifest and by the scriptures of
[2:20:47] prophet and according to the Commandment
[2:20:48] of the Everlasting God made known to All
[2:20:51] Nations for The Obedience of Faith so
[2:20:54] now it's made known what was Kept Secret
[2:20:58] we're making it known this is what I'm
[2:21:00] preaching this is Pentecostal
[2:21:04] preaching hallelujah amen this is
[2:21:07] Pentecostal preaching Pentecostal
[2:21:10] preaching is making known the
[2:21:15] Mysteries Ephesians 1 and verse 7 in
[2:21:18] whom we have Redemption through his
[2:21:20] blood the Forgiveness of sins according
[2:21:22] to the riches of his grace wherein he
[2:21:25] has abounded toward us in all wisdom oh
[2:21:29] Bountiful Bountiful toward us in all
[2:21:33] wisdom and Prudence having made known to
[2:21:35] us the
[2:21:37] mystery of his
[2:21:41] will according to his good pleasure
[2:21:44] which he purposed in himself so here
[2:21:46] again this was the will and testament of
[2:21:49] God he was making known his will
[2:21:53] according to his good pleasure let's go
[2:21:55] to ver chapter 3 and verse two of
[2:21:57] Ephesians if you heard the dispensation
[2:22:00] of the grace of God which is given to me
[2:22:03] given me to you word how that by
[2:22:06] Revelation he ha made known unto me the
[2:22:11] mystery I got this by
[2:22:15] Revelation the mystery watch as I wrote
[2:22:19] in a before in a few words whereby when
[2:22:22] you read you may understand mind
[2:22:24] acknowledge the mystery of Christ the
[2:22:27] mystery of Christ my knowledge of the
[2:22:30] mystery that which in other Ages was not
[2:22:34] made known Unto the Sons of man as now
[2:22:37] revealed unto His Holy Apostles and
[2:22:40] Prophets by the spirit the spirit that
[2:22:44] came down on Pentecost was word in power
[2:22:49] that's right and we saw the display of
[2:22:52] his power as it changed man but as it
[2:22:54] changed man it brought forth the word it
[2:22:58] unfolded the
[2:23:02] Mysteries that the Gentiles would be
[2:23:05] should be fellow ARS in the same body of
[2:23:08] the same body and partakers of his
[2:23:10] promise in Christ by the gospel it was
[2:23:12] not made known in other ages that
[2:23:14] Gentiles would even have a
[2:23:16] part although it was typed in the
[2:23:19] scripture
[2:23:22] come on it was typed in the Scripture it
[2:23:25] was prophesied in the scripture Joseph
[2:23:28] when he's away from his brethren in
[2:23:30] Exile amen been sold for almost 30
[2:23:34] pieces of silver cast to a pit thought
[2:23:37] he was dead lifting him up and put him
[2:23:39] there went to the right hand of pharaoh
[2:23:41] but amen while he was there he got a
[2:23:43] what a gentile
[2:23:45] bride then he reveals himself to his
[2:23:48] Brethren again the Jew news which will
[2:23:51] be happened after the during the
[2:23:53] tribulation period don't you see how it
[2:23:55] all
[2:23:56] works amen it's written in every type of
[2:23:59] the Bible it's written in the scriptures
[2:24:02] it's prophesied but it wasn't not made
[2:24:04] known it was there in symbols in
[2:24:07] parabolic
[2:24:11] form so he said unto me who am the least
[2:24:14] of the Saints of All Saints is this
[2:24:17] Grace given that I should preach among
[2:24:19] the Gentiles the UNC spiritual Riches of
[2:24:22] Christ I'm preaching the riches of
[2:24:25] Christ and to make all men to see what
[2:24:28] is the Fellowship of the mystery which
[2:24:31] from be from the beginning of the world
[2:24:34] has been hidden in God who created All
[2:24:37] Things by Jesus Christ to the attempt
[2:24:40] that now unto the principalities and
[2:24:42] powers in Heavenly places might be made
[2:24:44] known might be known by the church the
[2:24:47] manifold wisdom of God according to the
[2:24:50] Eternal purpose which his purpose in
[2:24:52] Christ Jesus our lord I'm trying to tell
[2:24:55] you Paul
[2:24:57] preached things from an open
[2:25:02] book let's go to Colossians 1:23 if you
[2:25:06] continue in the faith grounded settled
[2:25:08] and be not moved away from the hope of
[2:25:10] the Gospel which you have heard and
[2:25:13] which was preached to every creature
[2:25:15] which is under Heaven whereof I Paul am
[2:25:17] made a minister who now rejoice in my
[2:25:20] sufferings for you and fill up that
[2:25:22] which is my is behind the afflictions of
[2:25:24] Christ in my flesh for his body sake
[2:25:26] which is the church whereof I am made a
[2:25:29] minister according to the dispensation
[2:25:31] of God which was given to me for you to
[2:25:34] fulfill the word of God even the mystery
[2:25:37] which had been hid from ages and from
[2:25:40] generation but now is made manifest to
[2:25:43] the Saints to whom God would make known
[2:25:47] what is the riches of the glory of this
[2:25:49] mystery of among the Gentiles which is
[2:25:52] Christ in you the hope of glory oh
[2:25:55] Hallelujah who we preach warning every
[2:25:58] man teaching every man in all wisdom
[2:26:00] that we may present every man
[2:26:03] perfect in Christ
[2:26:09] Jesus and if we have been brought back
[2:26:11] to what Paul
[2:26:13] preached this is what's
[2:26:18] happening things that have been kept
[2:26:20] secret from the foundation of the world
[2:26:23] that Paul was expounding to the alpha
[2:26:26] church now again revealed to the Omega
[2:26:31] Church so he would preach the mystery of
[2:26:35] godliness verse Timothy 3:16 without
[2:26:39] controversy without argument great is a
[2:26:41] mystery of God is
[2:26:43] God was manifested in the flesh
[2:26:47] justified in the spirit seen of angels
[2:26:50] preached unto the Gentiles believed on
[2:26:53] the world and on in the world and
[2:26:56] received up in the glory he would preach
[2:26:59] about the blindness of Israel and he
[2:27:02] would talk about that mystery of the
[2:27:05] blindness and he said Romans 11:25 but
[2:27:08] for I would not Brethren that you should
[2:27:10] be ignorant of this mystery lest you
[2:27:13] should be wise and your own conceit that
[2:27:15] blindness and parties happened to Israel
[2:27:17] until the fullness of the of the
[2:27:20] Gentiles has come in so he said they
[2:27:22] would be blind for a time until the
[2:27:26] fullness of the Gentiles do you realize
[2:27:28] where we're at we're Israel's back in
[2:27:31] their
[2:27:32] Homeland there's a nation of Israel now
[2:27:35] they have gathered right there why for
[2:27:37] the revealing of Christ to them but it
[2:27:41] can't happen until the
[2:27:43] fullness of the Gentiles come in and
[2:27:47] that's where we're at
[2:27:50] he would preach on the mystery of the
[2:27:52] Resurrection he would preach on the
[2:27:54] mystery of the Rapture he would say it
[2:27:56] happens in three phases he will descend
[2:27:59] with a with a shout with a voice with a
[2:28:01] trump he would say in 1 Corinthians
[2:28:04] 15:51 but behold I show you a
[2:28:08] mystery it wasn't known in other
[2:28:11] times come on church do you realize this
[2:28:15] is why the Sadducees didn't believe in a
[2:28:17] resurrection they really couldn't find
[2:28:19] any script scripture for it but I'll
[2:28:22] tell you it was a mystery it was
[2:28:25] hidden come on it was hidden in the
[2:28:30] scripture Hallelujah that even even as
[2:28:34] Abraham went up to the mountain and
[2:28:37] received his son as one raised from the
[2:28:39] dead that there would come a
[2:28:41] resurrection where God would show
[2:28:43] himself as Jehovah jyra the one who
[2:28:46] would provide a lamb it would be over
[2:28:48] and over and over I don't have time to
[2:28:50] go through all the types of it but
[2:28:52] prophesying of a resurrection but it was
[2:28:54] shadowed so he said it's a mystery and
[2:28:56] behold I'm going to show you a Myster we
[2:28:58] shall not all sleep but we shall all be
[2:29:03] changed and the Rapture doesn't happen
[2:29:05] like a moment of twinkling of eye but
[2:29:07] you'll be changed next verse in a moment
[2:29:09] in the twinkling of an eye that's your
[2:29:11] change at the last Trump for the trumpet
[2:29:14] shall sound and the dead shall be raised
[2:29:16] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[2:29:19] I'm telling you friends he was preaching
[2:29:20] the Rapture the
[2:29:23] resurrection he's preaching the fullness
[2:29:25] of the
[2:29:26] Gentiles when they reach their
[2:29:28] fullness the gospel's going to go back
[2:29:31] to
[2:29:33] them and he said always remember he said
[2:29:35] you're like the Wild Olive Olive Branch
[2:29:38] that was grafted in you're going to be
[2:29:40] cut off one day the Gentiles will be cut
[2:29:42] off God will take a Remnant a bride home
[2:29:45] and cut off the rest of them he would
[2:29:47] show in Ephesians 5: verse 22 all the
[2:29:51] way down through 32 and and where he
[2:29:53] would say in verse 32 about a woman and
[2:29:56] he take a woman he said Christ is the
[2:29:58] head of the church and the man as the
[2:30:00] man is the head of the woman and so on
[2:30:03] like that and how they should the the
[2:30:04] woman should be submissive to the man
[2:30:06] and he's the head of the house and all
[2:30:08] these other thing how he should love her
[2:30:10] as Christ loved the church and and he he
[2:30:12] takes and he describes all of this and
[2:30:14] he's showing it he said but this is a
[2:30:17] great mystery verse 32 this is a great
[2:30:20] mystery but I speak concerning Christ
[2:30:24] and the
[2:30:25] church not only that but he would tell
[2:30:29] us when it's given to us we are stewards
[2:30:33] of the
[2:30:35] Mysteries 1 Corinthians 4:1 let a man so
[2:30:39] account of us as Ministers of Christ and
[2:30:43] stewards of the mysteries of God Amen as
[2:30:47] Servants of Christ Ministers of Christ
[2:30:50] we have a responsibility to serve the
[2:30:54] mysteries of the
[2:30:57] Kingdom this is why that he said um in
[2:31:00] Ephesians 6:18 praying always with all
[2:31:03] prayer and supplications in the spirit
[2:31:06] watching there unto for the perseverance
[2:31:08] and supplication of All Saints and for
[2:31:10] me that an utterance may be given me
[2:31:12] that I may open my mouth boldly to make
[2:31:15] known The Mystery of the Gospel
[2:31:20] he says in col Colossians 2 and 1 he
[2:31:23] says he he talks about it he said for I
[2:31:26] knew that you knew not what great
[2:31:29] conflict I have for you and for them at
[2:31:31] Leo deia for as many as have not seen my
[2:31:34] face in the flesh that their hearts
[2:31:36] might be comforted being knit together
[2:31:38] in love and unto the all Riches of the
[2:31:40] fullness full Assurance of understanding
[2:31:43] to the acknowledgment of the mystery of
[2:31:45] God and of the father and of Christ in
[2:31:47] whom are HID all Treasures of wisdom
[2:31:49] wisdom and
[2:31:52] knowledge then he asked for prayer in
[2:31:54] Colossians 4 and3 said pray for us that
[2:31:58] God would open to us a door of utterance
[2:32:00] to speak the mystery of Christ that'll
[2:32:02] be the prayer you pray forever Minister
[2:32:06] open the door of
[2:32:07] utterance allow them to speak of the
[2:32:11] mysteries of Christ look at it look
[2:32:13] again he would speak in 2 Thessalonians
[2:32:16] 2:7 he would speak of the mystery of
[2:32:21] iniquity amen the mystery of iniquity
[2:32:24] death already worked so he would say not
[2:32:28] only am I revealing you the mystery but
[2:32:31] the the Antichrist is already
[2:32:35] working and it's a it's the mystery of
[2:32:40] iniquity and so even the identity of the
[2:32:44] Antichrist the false Church her
[2:32:46] daughters would all be hidden
[2:32:50] and it would be a
[2:32:52] mystery so here Satan would be working
[2:32:58] undercover and as he kind Goes Forth he
[2:33:01] begins to close up the truths of the
[2:33:05] Bible and they become sealed with Seven
[2:33:09] Seals I'm telling you how the book got
[2:33:12] sealed and then he tells us in Galatians
[2:33:16] he warns us Galatians 1 and verse 6 I
[2:33:20] Marvel that you're so soon removed from
[2:33:23] him that called you into the grace of
[2:33:24] Christ to another gospel he said
[2:33:28] already already in this early age the
[2:33:33] mystery of iniquity is being
[2:33:36] preached I me
[2:33:38] already some are being removed from him
[2:33:41] that called them into Grace to another
[2:33:45] gospel
[2:33:50] verse
[2:33:51] seven which is not another but there be
[2:33:55] some that would trouble you and would
[2:33:57] pervert the
[2:33:59] gospel so Paul is already showing you
[2:34:02] here he's working now the Antichrist
[2:34:05] he's starting to work and he's working
[2:34:08] undercover and what he's wanting to do
[2:34:10] is steal the truth from you and replace
[2:34:14] it with another
[2:34:16] gospel now he's not through watch as he
[2:34:20] says they would
[2:34:21] pervert the gospel it wouldn't be
[2:34:25] something totally different it' just be
[2:34:27] a perversion of
[2:34:29] it so he comes along in verse eight and
[2:34:31] he says but though we are an angel from
[2:34:35] heaven preach any other gospel unto you
[2:34:38] that what we have preached unto you let
[2:34:41] him be a cursed as we said before so I
[2:34:44] say again if any man preach another
[2:34:47] gospel unto you than what you have
[2:34:48] received let him him be
[2:34:51] accursed so the
[2:34:53] Antichrist was already there and the the
[2:34:56] apostles knew it if you'll go with me to
[2:34:59] first John 4 it's known now beloved
[2:35:03] believe not every
[2:35:05] Spirit but try the spirits whether they
[2:35:08] are of God because many false prophets
[2:35:12] are going out in the world how be it
[2:35:15] hereby you know the spirit of God every
[2:35:17] spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ
[2:35:19] Christ has come in the flesh is of God
[2:35:21] every spirit that confesses not that
[2:35:23] Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is
[2:35:26] not of God and this is the spirit the
[2:35:27] Antichrist you know here they they
[2:35:29] hardly are removed to the last Apostle
[2:35:31] and people already say it never
[2:35:37] happened and then he says what's now and
[2:35:41] this is that an that Spirit of
[2:35:43] antichrist which you heard that should
[2:35:46] come and even now already in is in the
[2:35:52] world so the Antichrist is already
[2:35:55] working in the church the spirit has
[2:35:58] been poured out but the Antichrist is
[2:36:00] working and he's bringing another gospel
[2:36:04] what's now 2 Corinthians 11:2 for I'm
[2:36:08] jealous over
[2:36:09] you with a Godly jealousy for I have a
[2:36:13] spoused you to one husband that I may
[2:36:16] present you as a Chase virgin to Christ
[2:36:20] watch his wording look at what
[2:36:22] Revelation shows a great
[2:36:24] and Harlot
[2:36:29] daughters I'm
[2:36:31] jealous over you with Godly jealousy for
[2:36:34] I have a spouse you to one husband that
[2:36:38] I may present you as a Chase virgin to
[2:36:41] Christ but I fear I'm so afraid lest by
[2:36:45] any means just like the serpent begal
[2:36:47] Eve through his subtlety so your mind
[2:36:49] should be corrupted the mind is the womb
[2:36:52] of the spirit so that your womb should
[2:36:54] be corrupted from the Simplicity that is
[2:36:56] in Christ for he that cometh if he that
[2:37:00] cometh preaches another Jesus whom we
[2:37:02] have not
[2:37:04] preached are you receive another Spirit
[2:37:06] which you have not received or another
[2:37:08] gospel which you have not accepted you
[2:37:11] might well bear with him I'm afraid this
[2:37:13] is what you'll do you'll actually accept
[2:37:17] another Jesus you'll actually accept
[2:37:20] another gospel you actually will get
[2:37:24] another
[2:37:25] spirit that I did that God didn't give
[2:37:29] it would be an
[2:37:30] impersonation it would cause the church
[2:37:32] to stray and it did and she became the
[2:37:36] great
[2:37:38] whor go to Revelation
[2:37:41] 171 and there came one of the Seven
[2:37:44] Angels which had the seven bowls of
[2:37:47] judgment vials and talk with me sayth
[2:37:50] unto me come hither and I will show you
[2:37:53] the Judgment of the great horde that sth
[2:37:56] upon many Waters Waters is Nations
[2:37:59] kindreds tongues and people she rules
[2:38:03] over
[2:38:05] many with whom the kings of the Earth
[2:38:07] have committed
[2:38:09] fornication and the inhabitants of the
[2:38:11] Earth have been made drunk with the wine
[2:38:15] of her
[2:38:17] fornication oh my can you can you
[2:38:19] imagine imagine this drunken you get
[2:38:21] somebody drunk they can't even see clear
[2:38:23] anymore they're looking over there and
[2:38:25] they're seeing three Gods instead of
[2:38:29] one amen the whole scripture becomes
[2:38:33] distorted because they become drunk oh
[2:38:36] we are to be drunk we're to be drunk on
[2:38:39] new
[2:38:40] wine the wine of the spirit of God
[2:38:44] that's why he said don't be drunk with
[2:38:45] wine worry in this sucess but be filled
[2:38:47] with the spirit get drunk on
[2:38:49] Jesus amen it speaks of them in the in
[2:38:53] the New Testament as being intoxicated
[2:38:55] with the word there is an in
[2:38:58] toxication that should thrill your soul
[2:39:01] that should make you doubt your
[2:39:04] doubts amen that make you see your enemy
[2:39:07] is
[2:39:08] defeatable come on church amen like the
[2:39:11] story of a little mouse one time that
[2:39:13] had been chased around and around by cat
[2:39:15] all his life and was tormented and
[2:39:17] everything one day they had a big party
[2:39:19] in that house and there was a big bowl
[2:39:21] of wine and here here that little that
[2:39:23] little mouse that little mouse you know
[2:39:26] fell over into the wine and as it was
[2:39:29] going down is drinking too much of it
[2:39:31] and after a while he gets totally emed
[2:39:33] and you know finally crawls out of there
[2:39:35] and and he shakes himself off and he's
[2:39:37] said now where's that
[2:39:40] cat come on you ever get filled with the

[2:40:09] hallelujah look what he says now he said
[2:40:12] I'll show you this they're drunk on with
[2:40:15] the wine of her fornication the wine of
[2:40:17] her adulteries and he car carried me in
[2:40:19] the way of the spirit I saw a woman on a
[2:40:22] Scarlet colored Beast full of names of
[2:40:25] blasphemy and I'll just tell you to call
[2:40:27] ourselves after anything then the name
[2:40:29] of Jesus is
[2:40:32] blasphemy names of
[2:40:34] blasphemy amen never never never in the
[2:40:37] Bible are we to take on the name of

[2:40:59] kingdom of God and everyone that's born
[2:41:01] in the kingdom of God is our brother and
[2:41:04] sister Hallelujah and the woman was AR
[2:41:07] raay and purple and Scarlet colors and
[2:41:10] Deck with gold and precious stones and
[2:41:12] pearls and having a golden cup in her
[2:41:14] hand full of Abominations and filthiness
[2:41:16] and fornication and on her name forehead
[2:41:19] was named mystery Babylon so Babylon is
[2:41:25] here in a mystery
[2:41:28] form so that's why there had to be a
[2:41:31] call come out of
[2:41:33] Babylon back into the
[2:41:36] Homeland so zerubu and Zachariah there
[2:41:39] they're not far off are they here they
[2:41:42] have come out of Babylon zable means one
[2:41:45] who has come out of Babylon
[2:41:50] and that's who we are one who's come out
[2:41:52] of
[2:41:54] Babylon Amen to do what restore the
[2:41:57] temple to bring forth The Headstone to
[2:42:00] bring forth the finishing
[2:42:02] Stone amen what's now now watch and the
[2:42:06] woman was drunken verse
[2:42:09] six verse
[2:42:11] six well let me start with verse five Mr
[2:42:14] Babylon the great the mother of Harlot
[2:42:16] she was a mother you know
[2:42:20] mother of
[2:42:22] harlots who go right back and do the
[2:42:24] same thing Mama did taking seeds of man
[2:42:29] instead of the word of
[2:42:31] God and I saw the woman and she's
[2:42:36] drunk with the blood of the
[2:42:38] Saints and the blood of the martyrs of
[2:42:42] Jesus and when I saw her I wondered with
[2:42:47] great admiration
[2:42:50] this
[2:42:51] woman is a
[2:42:53] church if the if the if the true church
[2:42:56] is a woman the wife of Christ This is a
[2:43:00] woman who started out a
[2:43:03] virgin
[2:43:06] pledged pledged to Christ and committed
[2:43:10] adultery taking in other seeds and
[2:43:14] bringing forth
[2:43:15] children you see that's why we don't
[2:43:18] want to just be
[2:43:21] another and that's why we don't want a
[2:43:24] bunch of little Tim puits running around
[2:43:27] we want not not people born of man we
[2:43:33] want them born of
[2:43:35] God watch Jude 1 and three beh beloved I
[2:43:39] give you diligence to write to you of
[2:43:41] the common salvation as it's needful to
[2:43:43] write into you in order and exort you to
[2:43:46] earnestly contend to for the faith that
[2:43:49] was once delivered to this age we're
[2:43:51] already losing it and I want you to
[2:43:54] contend for it fight for it for why
[2:43:57] there are certain men crept in unawares
[2:44:00] who before of old were ordained to this
[2:44:02] uh condemnation ungodly man turning the
[2:44:05] grace of our God into lasciviousness
[2:44:08] into license to sin live any other way
[2:44:11] you want to and the grace of God is
[2:44:12] going to cover
[2:44:13] you and denying the only Lord Jesus Lord
[2:44:16] God and our Lord Jesus Christ and slowly
[2:44:19] the book and his truths became closed
[2:44:23] and sealed with Seven
[2:44:26] Seals and when the first one was
[2:44:29] open who was
[2:44:32] it that had sealed it
[2:44:37] up not
[2:44:39] God he don't close his word up from
[2:44:42] you but
[2:44:45] Satan Revelation
[2:44:47] 61 and when and I saw the lamb open one
[2:44:51] of the seals I heard as it was the noise
[2:44:54] of
[2:44:55] thunder and one of the four Beast said
[2:44:57] come and
[2:44:58] see and I saw and behold a white horse
[2:45:03] and him that sat on him had a bow and a
[2:45:06] crown was given to him and he went forth
[2:45:08] conquering and to conquer so it started
[2:45:13] out as a
[2:45:14] spirit and be remember he it it came and
[2:45:19] well look and then a crown was given him
[2:45:21] because you can't Crown a spirit but
[2:45:24] when it becomes a
[2:45:26] pope it can be
[2:45:28] crowned and so it started out as a
[2:45:31] nickan spirit which the Bible which
[2:45:33] which means conquer the Ley it was the
[2:45:36] enemy coming in to conquer the
[2:45:39] church and subdue it and make it
[2:45:42] subservient amen come on but well look
[2:45:46] he starts out his un Nicola and spirit
[2:45:48] in the church and he's a spirit you
[2:45:50] can't Crown a spirit but 300 years later
[2:45:53] he becomes a pope and you can crown him
[2:45:59] now and under that she becomes drunk
[2:46:02] with the blood of the Saints until the
[2:46:04] fox's book of martyrology will show
[2:46:07] you 68
[2:46:11] million down to the
[2:46:17] ages that's still has not been repented
[2:46:24] of here we come right
[2:46:27] down you
[2:46:29] see it began to start was kind of a
[2:46:32] saying then it became a Doctrine and
[2:46:35] next age it became
[2:46:38] crowned and so it comes right down and
[2:46:42] we look in Revelation 2 and 4 in the
[2:46:44] first church
[2:46:46] age nevertheless I have somewhat against
[2:46:50] you because thou H has left thy First
[2:46:54] Love here's my problem with you you're
[2:46:58] supposed to be my wife the
[2:47:00] church but you're already leaving your
[2:47:03] first
[2:47:05] love remember therefore from which Thou
[2:47:08] Art fallen so she's already
[2:47:12] fallen and repent and do the first works
[2:47:15] or else I'll come to the quickly and
[2:47:18] remove
[2:47:19] that
[2:47:20] Candlestick and the light of the Gospel
[2:47:24] began to dim and the book became closed
[2:47:29] slowly very slowly and its truth became
[2:47:34] Mysteries and finally in Revelation five
[2:47:38] it's held shown held in the hands of God
[2:47:42] sealed with Seven
[2:47:44] Seals and so has it been since the early
[2:47:47] ages sealed clothed closed and hidden
[2:47:51] and the only one that can open it is the
[2:47:54] same one that opened it to
[2:47:59] Paul this mountain shall be
[2:48:04] removed but it won't be by man's might
[2:48:08] and schools of
[2:48:09] learning but it'll be by by power sayith
[2:48:13] the
[2:48:14] Lord before zerubabel those that came
[2:48:17] out of Babylon it shall become a
[2:48:20] plane and ye shall bring forth the
