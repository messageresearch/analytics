[59:16] of that you uh you blessed many and we
[59:19] were all blessed and enjoyed it amen and
[59:22] I couldn't be more proud of you and
[59:25] thankful to you for um the provisions
[59:28] that you have provided and the
[59:30] facilities that you provided and helped
[59:33] us to have and whatever we could have
[59:35] such a wonderful time together and it
[59:37] was just wonderful and I could um I want
[59:41] to just say especially brother Timothy
[59:43] sister Lydia they poured out their heart
[59:45] in organizing that and I just um uh just
[59:50] you know we could just see with them and
[59:52] all that others that participated you
[59:54] you know I I think sometimes of the
[59:56] Unseen host and the ones that um maybe
[1:00:00] work in the be background that you never
[1:00:03] see they're never visible you know so
[1:00:06] it's kind of like um heart and lungs and
[1:00:09] liver and you know intestines things you
[1:00:12] don't ever see but they're vitally
[1:00:14] important you know and so that's the way
[1:00:17] it is every one of you are important to
[1:00:19] the body of Christ and we want to say we
[1:00:22] appreciate you very very much I I think
[1:00:25] about how often the the brothers up in
[1:00:28] the sound booth and the security cameras
[1:00:31] and recordings and and the overhead for
[1:00:33] the Sisters there that different ones
[1:00:35] that help you know how how important you
[1:00:39] are in making this service what it is
[1:00:42] musicians and uh deacons trustees and
[1:00:46] you the worshipper coming together
[1:00:49] without you I'll tell you what Co showed
[1:00:51] me it's hard to preach to an empty
[1:00:53] building you know
[1:00:55] and and I I really I really love to see
[1:00:58] um you know people to preach to amen I
[1:01:02] uh had my first experience of that
[1:01:04] really you know when I was in Uganda and
[1:01:06] they asked me to preach to on the radio
[1:01:09] and and so they would give me a signal
[1:01:11] you know to start here and then you know
[1:01:13] it was a free uh program so we had to
[1:01:15] break for a
[1:01:17] commercial and so you know you speak for
[1:01:20] a few minutes and he'd give you the
[1:01:22] signal and you had to wind down your
[1:01:24] thought and then and and bring it to and
[1:01:26] then the commercial and then pick up
[1:01:28] your thought and go
[1:01:30] again I'm glad we don't have to break
[1:01:32] for commercials
[1:01:34] here amen I'll take a break anytime with
[1:01:37] shouting and rejoicing in the things of
[1:01:40] God but no commercials here okay amen
[1:01:43] other than worshiping our lord Jesus who
[1:01:47] gave It All To Us amen we'll break for
[1:01:50] our sponsor right now the Lord Jesus
[1:01:52] provided all of this for you by by his
[1:01:54] grace
[1:01:56] amen
[1:01:59] amen amen we so love the Lord and so
[1:02:03] love you and so appreciate you will you
[1:02:04] turn with me to Joshua chapter 5 and and
[1:02:07] verse 10 and let's just um look in the
[1:02:10] things of God today have several
[1:02:12] scriptures I want to read maybe uh won't
[1:02:16] keep his standing long but we we stand
[1:02:20] like this not in honor cuz I come out
[1:02:22] you know that but in honor for the for
[1:02:26] the reading of the word of God they did
[1:02:29] this in the book of Ezra and when they
[1:02:31] read the law the people stood and
[1:02:34] worshiped God so you know many stand in
[1:02:38] honor to the flag and salute the flag
[1:02:41] and we are standing here to salute the
[1:02:44] word of God and to lift it high and say
[1:02:48] it's a holy word and it's applicable for
[1:02:51] our day for our hour we can look in this
[1:02:54] and see and we'll be looking at it today
[1:02:56] and see that it's prophecy and then we
[1:02:59] are the interpretation of that so when
[1:03:01] we talk about types and fulfillment of
[1:03:04] types that's what we're talking about
[1:03:06] type is is a shadow I wish I could show
[1:03:09] you a shadow how how the light you know
[1:03:11] comes and and and something gets in the
[1:03:14] way of the light and as it's approaching
[1:03:16] though you know it puts a shadow and and
[1:03:20] so the shadow is what we're reading in
[1:03:23] the Bible it's a
[1:03:25] foreshadowing as Paul said these things
[1:03:27] are an example of things to come and and
[1:03:31] so he would look in there and actually
[1:03:34] pull from there things that he could see
[1:03:37] was being fulfilled in his hour that's
[1:03:40] why we go to the Bible like we do it's
[1:03:42] not just reading history it's not just
[1:03:44] reading uh something in the old text or
[1:03:47] what no it's a prophecy it's a shadow
[1:03:51] because something greater was coming you
[1:03:54] see and it's just portraying that which
[1:03:56] is coming you can look at the Shadow and
[1:03:58] get an idea of what is promised and
[1:04:01] what's being fulfilled so you know Paul
[1:04:04] would speak of this uh Jesus would use
[1:04:06] Parables and Paul would say these things
[1:04:08] were given to you for examples and and
[1:04:12] so then he would use these uh the things
[1:04:16] that happened in the heavens and Moses
[1:04:18] saw was a pattern of what he built the
[1:04:21] temple on the Earth all these things
[1:04:23] that are laid in there for our
[1:04:25] understanding now let's go to Joshua
[1:04:28] chap 5 and verse 10 and the children of
[1:04:32] Israel encamped in
[1:04:34] gilgal and kept the Passover on the 14th
[1:04:38] day of the month at even in the plains
[1:04:41] of Jericho and they did eat of the old
[1:04:45] corn of the land on the marrow after the
[1:04:48] Passover unle cakes and parched corn in
[1:04:52] the self same day and and the Mana
[1:04:54] ceased on the tomorrow after they had
[1:04:56] eaten of the old corn of the land
[1:04:59] neither had the children of Israel Mana
[1:05:02] anymore but they did eat of the fruit of
[1:05:05] the land of Canaan that year God bless
[1:05:09] you you can be seated and if you will
[1:05:12] kindly turn with me to Exodus chapter 16
[1:05:16] and we'll read from verse 14 to just
[1:05:19] continue some of the scriptures that I
[1:05:22] want
[1:05:23] to
[1:05:25] reference today so um this is of course
[1:05:29] after they have left Egypt now they've
[1:05:32] cross through the Red Sea and and uh you
[1:05:35] know the enemies is dead and so here
[1:05:38] comes um the outpouring of God's
[1:05:41] blessings look at verse 14 Exodus
[1:05:45] 16:14 and when the Dew that lay was
[1:05:48] going up behold upon the face of the
[1:05:51] Wilderness there lay a small round thing
[1:05:55] as small as the hor frost on the ground
[1:06:00] and when the children of Israel saw it
[1:06:02] they said to one another it is
[1:06:05] mana and for they wish not what it was
[1:06:08] it actually means uh what is this you
[1:06:11] know they didn't know what it was this
[1:06:14] had never been seen before and Moses
[1:06:18] said unto them this is the bread which
[1:06:21] the Lord hath given you to eat
[1:06:24] and this is the thing which the Lord
[1:06:27] hath commanded gather it of every man
[1:06:31] according to his eating and Homer for
[1:06:33] every man according to the number of
[1:06:35] your persons take ye every man for them
[1:06:39] which are in his tents and the children
[1:06:41] of Israel did so and gathered some more
[1:06:44] some less and when they did meet it with
[1:06:48] an OM he that gathered much had nothing
[1:06:52] left over and he that gathered little
[1:06:55] Had No Lack and they gathered every man
[1:06:58] according to his eating and Moses said
[1:07:01] let no man leave of it till the morning
[1:07:05] not withstanding they hearkened not to
[1:07:09] Moses but some of them left of it until
[1:07:12] the morning and it bred worms and stank
[1:07:17] and Moses was wroth with them skip down
[1:07:20] to verse 31 now and the house of Israel
[1:07:23] called called the name
[1:07:26] thereof mana and it was like coriander
[1:07:29] seed White and the taste of it was like
[1:07:32] Wafers made with honey and Moses said
[1:07:36] this is the thing which the Lord
[1:07:38] commandeth fill an of it to be kept for
[1:07:42] your Generations that they may see the
[1:07:44] bread wherewith I have fed you in the
[1:07:47] wilderness when I brought you forth from
[1:07:50] the land of Egypt and Moses said unto a
[1:07:53] Aon take the pot take a pot and put a
[1:07:57] full of Mana therein and lay it up
[1:07:59] before the Lord to be kept for your
[1:08:02] generations and as the Lord commanded
[1:08:05] Moses so Aaron laid it up before the
[1:08:09] testimony to be kept and the children of
[1:08:12] Israel did eat Mana 40 years until they
[1:08:16] came to a land inhabited they did eat
[1:08:19] Mana until they came unto the borders of
[1:08:23] the land land of Canaan amen now I'm
[1:08:27] going to speak to you this morning on as
[1:08:31] you saw us in in Joshua's account and
[1:08:35] they had come into the canaan's land and
[1:08:38] there the Mana ceased I'm going to speak
[1:08:40] today on the day that Mana will
[1:08:44] cease so you know Mana would have had to
[1:08:47] be a complete
[1:08:49] diet it had to be full of minerals and
[1:08:52] vitamins and
[1:08:54] you know eating eating on it the Bible
[1:08:57] tells us that none would be old or
[1:08:59] feeble Psalms
[1:09:01] 105:37 where he records that the
[1:09:05] Egyptians were stripped and he brought
[1:09:07] them forth with um um silver and gold
[1:09:11] and there was not one feeble person
[1:09:14] among their tribes so you see they when
[1:09:19] God brought them out he not only brought
[1:09:22] them out but they got back pay for the
[1:09:25] years and years of
[1:09:26] slavery you know I I I think of that a
[1:09:29] lot of times we think about coming to
[1:09:31] Christ and oh well we're going to have
[1:09:33] to pay for all the sins and the problems
[1:09:36] and the the things of our past but
[1:09:38] actually you know the this type shows
[1:09:40] you you're going to get some back pay
[1:09:43] what the devil has taken from you God is
[1:09:45] about to restore and he's going to do
[1:09:48] more than that but you're going to get
[1:09:50] the blessings the back PID that the
[1:09:51] devil robbed of you how many's ready for
[1:09:54] some back payback amen that you know
[1:09:57] things that the devil has stolen from
[1:10:00] you and taken from you that God is about
[1:10:03] not just to restore you but give you
[1:10:05] extra blessings send you back with the
[1:10:07] back pay as the Bible said they would
[1:10:10] leave out with the gold and silver I
[1:10:12] mean they stripped the Egyptians as they
[1:10:14] borrowed every man for their neighbor
[1:10:16] but you know they wouldn't stealing
[1:10:18] anything they was actually getting
[1:10:20] payment for the years and years of
[1:10:22] slavery
[1:10:24] and the blessings of God when God gives
[1:10:27] you the blessings of Calvary he brings
[1:10:30] it such
[1:10:31] abundance such greatness until you you
[1:10:35] can start expecting some paybacks
[1:10:38] instead of still suffering because of
[1:10:40] your past you look back and say no you
[1:10:43] know for those years that I I've spent
[1:10:45] in slavery and in sin and darkness and
[1:10:49] whipped by the devil I'm expecting some
[1:10:52] Payback
[1:10:54] amen for the blessings of God to be come
[1:10:57] upon my life upon my home upon my upon
[1:11:01] anything my family a restoration but
[1:11:05] more than restoration
[1:11:08] payback amen and I'm looking for a great
[1:11:12] day when a real payback's
[1:11:14] coming now the of course um as we see
[1:11:19] the Holy Ghost is our Mana today which
[1:11:22] is the word made spirit and power and it
[1:11:26] has sustaining strength and power in it
[1:11:29] the Divine energy for the journey so
[1:11:32] that there won't be one feeble one among
[1:11:36] us but all strong committed faithful
[1:11:41] Christians that's what God wants in his
[1:11:45] in his people amen we Invision of people
[1:11:48] that are not feeble that are not weak
[1:11:51] Christians but strong Believers in the
[1:11:55] faith knows where they stand because
[1:11:58] they are partaking of heavenly mana and
[1:12:02] that Mana has all the vitamins and all
[1:12:04] the minerals and everything needed for
[1:12:07] the journey in Psalm 78 and verse 23 he
[1:12:11] said though he commanded the clouds from
[1:12:14] above and opened the doors of heaven
[1:12:17] isn't this wonderful God opening the
[1:12:20] doors of heaven and rained down Mana
[1:12:23] upon them to eat had given them the corn
[1:12:26] of Heaven man did eat Angels food he
[1:12:29] sent them meat to the
[1:12:31] full now of course that's not only
[1:12:34] promised in the Old Testament but it's
[1:12:37] also promised in the new so let's look
[1:12:39] over here in Revelation 2:17 where to
[1:12:43] the Overcomer is also given mana and he
[1:12:47] that ha an ear let him hear what the
[1:12:49] spirit said to the churches to him that
[1:12:51] overcometh will I give to E e of the
[1:12:54] Hidden mana and will give him a white
[1:12:57] stone and that stone a new name written
[1:12:59] which no man knoweth sa in he that
[1:13:01] receives it so you see it's not just
[1:13:04] Mana that Falls Daily but Mana that is
[1:13:08] also stored up behind the veil that only
[1:13:11] the priest could eat for he ha made us
[1:13:15] under our God Kings and Priests and we
[1:13:18] shall reign upon the Earth for you are a
[1:13:20] holy nation a royal priesthood that we
[1:13:24] should show forth the Praises of him who
[1:13:26] have called us out of Darkness Into His
[1:13:28] Marvelous Light now as we said about
[1:13:32] types A type can be used in many ways in
[1:13:34] our message today we're going to type
[1:13:37] leaving Egypt which was leaving the law
[1:13:40] and going into Grace the gospel of grace
[1:13:44] now has taken us down a long journey
[1:13:47] through seven Church ages and and of
[1:13:51] course we're now here at the end of the
[1:13:53] Ages which is the leoan age and and and
[1:13:57] of course we're we're here on the edge
[1:14:00] now as we type it this way this morning
[1:14:02] of the promised land in the Millennium
[1:14:05] ahead when we will enter the millennial
[1:14:08] Reign and that's when the Mana will
[1:14:11] cease the Holy Ghost is the Mana that we
[1:14:15] have received and it will and will it
[1:14:19] will cease falling and there will be no
[1:14:22] more Mana
[1:14:24] now if you're a student of the message
[1:14:26] you know the promised land types the
[1:14:28] Holy Ghost and and not the Millennium
[1:14:31] but in this case it does and I have many
[1:14:35] quotes where brother bradam uses it in
[1:14:36] this way as regarded to the subject at
[1:14:39] hand so the the the use of the type
[1:14:42] today will type Mana as the Holy Ghost
[1:14:47] and the land that we're going to the
[1:14:49] Millennium amen so now Israel has left
[1:14:53] Egypt and has journeyed through the
[1:14:55] Wilderness they are sustained by a daily
[1:14:59] outpouring of Mana from Heaven they will
[1:15:03] go from Passover in Egypt to experience
[1:15:07] Passover again as soon as they enter
[1:15:10] into the promised land the first
[1:15:13] Passover in Egypt and then the first
[1:15:15] Passover in the promised land and we too
[1:15:18] we go from Passover to
[1:15:20] Passover amen there at just before Jesus
[1:15:24] would go to Calvary of course you know
[1:15:26] he was a Passover Lamb and he celebrates
[1:15:29] the Passover with his disciples and and
[1:15:33] he says the fruit of the Vine I won't
[1:15:36] drink it with you again until I drink it
[1:15:39] new with you in my father's Kingdom so
[1:15:43] Matthew
[1:15:44] 26:26 it tells of the account of the
[1:15:47] Passover and as they were eating Jesus
[1:15:50] Took bread and blessed it and and break
[1:15:53] it and gave it to his disciples and said
[1:15:57] take eat this is my body and he took the
[1:16:00] cup and gave thanks and gave it to them
[1:16:03] and said drink you all of it and and he
[1:16:07] says for this is my blood of the new
[1:16:11] testament which is shed for many for the
[1:16:14] remission of sins but I say unto you I
[1:16:17] will not drink henceforth of this fruit
[1:16:19] of the vine until that day that I will
[1:16:22] drink it new with you in my father's
[1:16:25] Kingdom so again here again you know we
[1:16:28] we see Israel coming now into the
[1:16:31] promised land and the first thing they
[1:16:33] do is celebrate the
[1:16:36] Passover and when we get home oh I look
[1:16:40] for the time when we get home when we
[1:16:43] enter into the millennial Reign and and
[1:16:46] peace comes upon the Earth and we enter
[1:16:50] into into that blessed r
[1:16:54] oh where God has had it in his mind
[1:16:56] before the foundational world have his
[1:16:59] kingdom here upon the earth and the
[1:17:01] great Millennial Reign and we long today
[1:17:04] with ancient heart thinking of the great
[1:17:07] time where we'll sit together at the
[1:17:09] Lord's supper and drink the fruit of the
[1:17:12] vine and eat a new the food in the
[1:17:15] Kingdom oh my to sit at that table
[1:17:19] described as a table thousands of miles
[1:17:22] long
[1:17:23] where we look across at each
[1:17:26] other and we shake one another's
[1:17:29] hands and little tear drop run down our
[1:17:33] cheek yes Hallelujah as we look at at
[1:17:36] one another and say here we are
[1:17:39] celebrating celebrating what Calvary did
[1:17:42] for us celebrating the lamb remembering
[1:17:47] remember what brought us into this
[1:17:49] Kingdom and the tears come down our face
[1:17:51] and hear the king will come down and
[1:17:54] with his in his white robe and walk
[1:17:56] around the table and wipe all the tears
[1:18:00] from our
[1:18:01] eyes what a day that's going to be where
[1:18:04] he'll say enter into the joys of the
[1:18:07] lord it's been prepared for you since
[1:18:10] the foundation of the
[1:18:12] world now this
[1:18:14] type represents Christ who is our
[1:18:17] Passover and he is the bread for the
[1:18:21] Passover and the drink
[1:18:24] notice he is also the bread for our
[1:18:28] journey you remember just as just as
[1:18:32] they had bread for their journey and
[1:18:35] we're on the way and we have been on the
[1:18:37] way through the Wilderness from Seven
[1:18:39] Church ages and now about to enter into
[1:18:43] the the great coming of the Lord and the
[1:18:45] marriage supper of the Lamb that we just
[1:18:47] described in the and and then again into
[1:18:50] the the millennium ahe but listen Jesus
[1:18:54] declares himself as that bread look here
[1:18:58] in John 6:48 I am that bread of life
[1:19:03] amen your fathers did eat Mana in the
[1:19:05] wilderness and are dead but this is the
[1:19:08] bread which cometh down from heaven a
[1:19:11] man that a man may eat thereof and not
[1:19:14] die I am the living bread which came
[1:19:17] down from heaven if a man eateth this
[1:19:19] bread he shall live forever and the
[1:19:23] bread that I will give is my flesh which
[1:19:25] I will give for the life of the world as
[1:19:28] a living father has sent me I live by
[1:19:31] the father and so he that eateth me even
[1:19:35] shall live by me and this is that bread
[1:19:38] which came down from heaven not as your
[1:19:41] fathers did eat mana and are dead he
[1:19:44] that eateth of this bread shall live
[1:19:47] forever so we know what the bread is
[1:19:50] it's eternal life amen it's the very
[1:19:53] Spirit of Jesus how in the world else
[1:19:55] could you eat him you can't eat his his
[1:19:57] literal flesh or drink his literal blood
[1:20:00] but you can receive his life into you
[1:20:03] and the strength of that and the
[1:20:04] strength coming from him is for the
[1:20:08] journey notice that this Mana it fell on
[1:20:12] the day of Pentecost when God opened up
[1:20:15] the windows of
[1:20:17] Heaven amen as we read there in Psalms
[1:20:22] 78 23 though he had commanded the clouds
[1:20:25] from heaven above and opened the doors
[1:20:28] of heaven and rained down Mana from upon
[1:20:31] them to eat and given them of the Corn
[1:20:33] of Heaven you see what a beautiful type
[1:20:37] this is because the same thing happens
[1:20:39] for the New Testament Church after you
[1:20:41] come through the Red Sea of
[1:20:44] sanctification after you leave the Egypt
[1:20:46] of the world and and you pass through
[1:20:48] the Red Sea what happens when the
[1:20:50] heavens open and when the heaven open
[1:20:53] what happened there come a sound from
[1:20:55] heaven like a rushing Mighty Wind amen
[1:20:58] and the and the bread came down from
[1:21:01] heaven holy Mana the spirit of God the D
[1:21:06] that the church has to live
[1:21:08] upon amen and that Holy Ghost was poured
[1:21:13] out hallelujah it's our life sustaining
[1:21:17] resource that only comes by the Holy
[1:21:20] Ghost and as soon as the OST Les had
[1:21:23] crossed out all the fear and the doubt
[1:21:26] and the confusion and gathered in the
[1:21:28] upper room God gave them the baptism of
[1:21:31] the Holy Ghost and when it fell down it
[1:21:33] was our Mana coming from God out of
[1:21:37] Heaven it came like a rushan Mighty
[1:21:40] Wind and all the house that they were
[1:21:43] sitting clothing tongues like fire set
[1:21:46] upon them amen just think about that
[1:21:49] this is the Holy Ghost amen this is the
[1:21:52] very spirit of God coming down and as he
[1:21:55] does he divides each one his
[1:21:58] portion hallelujah amen there's enough

[1:22:25] guess what he's going to do it for the
[1:22:26] whole journey for he says in the last
[1:22:30] days the last 2,000 years covered the
[1:22:33] entire Gentile dispensation I'm going to
[1:22:37] pour out
[1:22:39] Mana I'm going to pour out my spirit

[1:22:59] enough of Mana for today he hasn't run
[1:23:02] out and windows of heaven will open even

[1:29:59] tells you that you're going to be drunk
[1:30:01] one way or the other amen there are some
[1:30:04] that are going to be drunk on the
[1:30:05] martyrs of the
[1:30:07] Saints we got we got evil people in this
[1:30:11] world that are drunk on the Marty of the
[1:30:14] Jews hey that that they're drunk on it
[1:30:19] are you with me we got others that are
[1:30:21] drunk on the on the the on the on the
[1:30:25] wine of the fornication of the great
[1:30:27] that has poured out her false
[1:30:30] doctrines to the ages and they're drunk
[1:30:32] on it so you going to be drunk on
[1:30:36] something why not be drunk on the spirit
[1:30:40] why I get so filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:30:43] until you forget your blues and be
[1:30:45] filled with the joy until you leave this
[1:30:50] world joy unspeakable and full of Glory
[1:30:53] there's a constant
[1:30:55] stimulation it's a constant
[1:30:59] intoxication D drunk day and night amen
[1:31:02] that's the word of God
[1:31:05] Amen now the Bible equates this with the
[1:31:11] spirit it had the same effect as
[1:31:17] wine now you know I I know a lot of
[1:31:22] times you preach like this and you think
[1:31:24] you know people come across well you
[1:31:27] know you're I I tell you what you're
[1:31:29] you're just not a very revelated Church
[1:31:32] you're not really revelated you know you
[1:31:35] you're you're way back behind you're
[1:31:37] you're
[1:31:38] Pentecostal you better be Pentecostal or
[1:31:40] you're not
[1:31:42] saved
[1:31:45] amen that's God's original way that's
[1:31:48] the way the church starts out that's the
[1:31:49] way church has to end whatever planet is
[1:31:52] what comes
[1:31:53] up and if you got something is being
[1:31:56] produced in your church other than
[1:31:57] Pentecost it is not the Holy
[1:32:00] Ghost it ain't the word of
[1:32:03] God
[1:32:05] Amen now the now brother brandham when
[1:32:09] he goes to preach the third and the
[1:32:10] fourth seal as the mysteries of God are
[1:32:14] being
[1:32:15] broken now the Deep mystery
[1:32:19] truth broke into the people people
[1:32:22] brought out in the
[1:32:24] scripture amen and and and as he brings
[1:32:28] out the
[1:32:30] scripture of the black horse
[1:32:32] rider and he goes forth to conquer with
[1:32:36] his
[1:32:37] Darkness are you with me now and as he
[1:32:40] does he goes to block out with Darkness
[1:32:44] the knowledge of the word with a with a
[1:32:47] black horse
[1:32:48] rider but there's something that
[1:32:50] screamed forth during in that time of
[1:32:53] darkness and it comes from the very
[1:32:55] heart of the Lamb himself and it screams
[1:32:58] out but don't you hurt the oil and the
[1:33:04] wine now how can you say you have true
[1:33:08] Revelation and the oil of the Holy
[1:33:11] Spirit and the wine of Revelation isn't
[1:33:15] there to stimulate the
[1:33:18] believer now I I mean in too many
[1:33:21] message is it's dead dead dead
[1:33:25] dead amen now this is supposed to be a
[1:33:29] restored brid tree not a dead brid
[1:33:32] tree she was eat down to a stump
[1:33:36] remember amen but this is supposed to be
[1:33:38] the restoration of the brid
[1:33:41] tree not the desecration of the brid
[1:33:45] tree so he said in there in restoration
[1:33:48] of the Bride tree As He restored it
[1:33:52] he says so we look that the
[1:33:55] Antichrist that old worm that that old
[1:33:59] Palmer worm or caterpillar he took away
[1:34:02] the
[1:34:06] joy you know David one time lost the joy
[1:34:09] of his salvation he didn't lose his
[1:34:11] salvation but he just lost the joy of it
[1:34:14] and he cried Lord restore to me the joy
[1:34:16] of my salvation there's something that
[1:34:19] we ought to be able to cry out to God
[1:34:21] today if we're
[1:34:24] saved Lord just give me some more
[1:34:27] joy amen so this little p wor begin to
[1:34:30] eat that fruit of joy out now look here
[1:34:33] you people make too much noise I'm
[1:34:36] quoting I tell you all this crying
[1:34:38] saying amen and this shouting that's
[1:34:41] nonsense there's nothing to that the
[1:34:44] first thing you know he sat in a big
[1:34:46] morg you know sitting there them all
[1:34:49] dead that's right some of these emalin
[1:34:53] fluids of so-called doctrine of Creeds
[1:34:56] pumped up in their veins where the
[1:34:58] spirit of God ought to be running hello
[1:35:02] were the old church Creed pumped in
[1:35:04] there no wonder they're icy cold and
[1:35:06] dead spiritual thermometer 90 de below
[1:35:10] zero yeah somebody say amen and
[1:35:12] everybody stretched their neck around
[1:35:13] like some
[1:35:15] Goose want to know why who said that
[1:35:18] it's a shame but when the spirit of God
[1:35:21] ought to be joy peace and love but this
[1:35:24] little old bug started eating on it and
[1:35:26] he ate all the joy
[1:35:29] away well I tell you what it's a shame
[1:35:31] to say but many of they're so ate
[1:35:34] down thinking they got a knowledge of
[1:35:37] the message and this knowledge of the
[1:35:40] message you know the letter has killed
[1:35:43] him and there's no Spirit left it
[1:35:49] all but listen to what he said in the
[1:35:51] third seal as as this was being broke
[1:35:54] open hurt not the oil of the wine he
[1:35:56] said when a truth of the promised word
[1:35:59] of God has been truly revealed to his
[1:36:03] saints that is filled with oil that's
[1:36:05] the Holy Ghost you know they all get
[1:36:09] stimulated amen wine is a stimulation
[1:36:12] Glory I feel it right now same effect
[1:36:15] amen stimulated with shouts and joy and
[1:36:19] when it does it has a same effect oh
[1:36:22] listen to this the same effect upon them
[1:36:26] that winders on the natural
[1:36:29] man woo Amen brother when you get this
[1:36:34] Bread of
[1:36:35] Heaven amen it is not just the bread
[1:36:38] it's the wine that goes with
[1:36:40] it come on Amen because in this when the
[1:36:44] Mana comes down it's it's not just dead
[1:36:47] word come on it is it is not dead letter
[1:36:51] that kills it's the spirit that makes
[1:36:54] alive and when it does brother it brings
[1:36:57] out the shouts of Hallelujah the glory
[1:36:59] to God I was once lost in sin I was once
[1:37:03] sick with cancer I was once bound I was
[1:37:07] once defeated but now I'm alive in
[1:37:10] Christ
[1:37:12] Jesus
[1:37:14] hallelujah oh he says wine is a
[1:37:18] stimulation Glory I feel it right now
[1:37:22] amen it has the same effect upon them
[1:37:27] that wine does upon a natural
[1:37:30] man woo the same effect that wine does
[1:37:35] on a natural man because when the
[1:37:37] Revelation has been given of a truth of
[1:37:41] God and the True Believer filled with
[1:37:43] oil and the Revelation is revealed the
[1:37:46] stimulation becomes so great that it
[1:37:49] makes him behave himself
[1:37:51] unnormal that's right Glory it may maybe
[1:37:54] that's what's matter with them now
[1:37:56] that's right it makes them behave their
[1:37:58] themselves
[1:38:00] unseemingly wo you say well we're a
[1:38:02] revelation people well I tell you what I
[1:38:05] can tell a lot of people whatever you're
[1:38:07] preaching with it's a
[1:38:09] dud there ain't no zip to
[1:38:14] it the life has all gone out of it it
[1:38:17] don't bring any stimulation come on it
[1:38:20] don't have this same effect on you that
[1:38:23] wine
[1:38:24] does Amen why the wine of the Holy Ghost
[1:38:27] will make you forget all your problems
[1:38:30] it'll make you love everybody it'll make
[1:38:33] you shout it'll take away the blues
[1:38:35] it'll cause you to put your head up high
[1:38:37] and know you can whip every devil know
[1:38:40] that you're more than a conqueror know
[1:38:42] that you are an overcomer know that
[1:38:44] greater is he that is in you that he
[1:38:47] that is in the world know who you are
[1:38:50] know that you're called know that you're
[1:38:52] ordained know that you have Hallelujah
[1:38:55] been set free by the glory of God and
[1:38:57] it'll make you shout and it'll make you
[1:39:00] behave yourself
[1:39:05] abnormally oh
[1:39:07] [Applause]
[1:39:08] yeah we believe the prophet brother Tim
[1:39:11] you don't believe
[1:39:15] this is evidenced by your
[1:39:18] behavior you never had a drink come on
[1:39:21] you never got drunk on the
[1:39:23] spirit you never tasted a new
[1:39:29] wine now he said if you want to just if
[1:39:32] you want scripture for this brother
[1:39:35] brandham just want scripture just start
[1:39:37] reading acts
[1:39:38] two what what they have they had the
[1:39:41] promise that had been given when all the
[1:39:43] promise of the Holy Spirit was poured
[1:39:46] out upon them it was scripturally a
[1:39:50] Vindicated amen what happened it made
[1:39:52] themel behave
[1:39:55] unseemingly they were drunk on new wine
[1:39:59] yes sir come on Amen they came out with
[1:40:03] a testimony they came out on fire they
[1:40:06] were not lukewarm and cold and
[1:40:11] formal I tell you what if your church
[1:40:13] ain't pattern after Acts 2 it's a dead
[1:40:16] dead dead
[1:40:17] [Applause]
[1:40:19] church amen
[1:40:21] amen now the Bible said in in Ephesians
[1:40:25] 5:18 and here he equates it he equates
[1:40:29] the spirit of God with being drunk on
[1:40:32] wine watch what he said and be not drunk
[1:40:33] with
[1:40:34] wine wherein is excess now he's making a
[1:40:38] comparison but be filled with the
[1:40:43] spirit amen be filled with the spirit
[1:40:47] don't be drunk with wine which is excess
[1:40:50] but be filled with the spirit so he
[1:40:54] equates the coming of the spirit with
[1:40:56] being drunk on
[1:40:58] wine amen it's a perfect intoxication
[1:41:01] for anybody that's got the
[1:41:04] blues amen oh my when you come when you
[1:41:08] come into the presence of God you'll

[1:41:14] enemies you make you love everybody it
[1:41:18] takes all the odd out of your heart come
[1:41:20] on
[1:41:21] it causes you to worship and behave
[1:41:23] yourself
[1:41:26] unseemingly they get stimulated by
[1:41:29] Revelation you can tell you know a lot
[1:41:32] of people's what they call Revelation
[1:41:34] ain't got no life in it there's no zip
[1:41:36] in
[1:41:41] it
[1:41:44] now I'll just quote brother brandom be
[1:41:47] not drunk drunk upon strong drink but be
[1:41:51] drunk on the spirit Hallelujah that's
[1:41:54] what we need today is an oldfashioned

[1:49:48] staggered like she was drunk on whiskey
[1:49:50] or something and you think you're going
[1:49:52] to get to Heaven by slipping over to the

[1:50:27] women every one of them was full of new
[1:50:29] wine if God ever changed that program
[1:50:33] put your finger on the scripture for me
[1:50:35] it isn't there no sir it was plumbed to
[1:50:39] the end of the age that way plumbed
[1:50:41] right to the end of the Bible and it
[1:50:43] will be the same thing until Jesus
[1:50:49] comes
[1:50:51] hallelujah hallelujah I believe we can
[1:50:54] have a great outpouring of the Holy
[1:50:56] Spirit right now this
[1:50:59] morning his promises are just real
[1:51:03] today amen the Bible said God Reign
[1:51:06] bread out of Heaven well Acts 2 said he
[1:51:08] reigned the Holy Ghost which is a
[1:51:10] Heavenly manner out of
[1:51:13] heaven and of course when it rained down
[1:51:17] Moses instructed Aaron said now listen
[1:51:20] what I want you boys to do I want you to
[1:51:22] go out there and I want you to get some
[1:51:25] HR full of this
[1:51:27] mana and you know and and I want you to
[1:51:31] take it into the holiest of holies and
[1:51:34] because there under the sh kind of Glory
[1:51:37] it won't
[1:51:39] deteriorate if it's kept in the Holy
[1:51:42] place so what's it far that all down to
[1:51:45] your generation that every priest that's
[1:51:48] ordained to be a priest that comes into
[1:51:50] the holy place that you can go in there
[1:51:53] with these rers and pick up some of that
[1:51:55] original
[1:51:57] mana and come out and lay it on his
[1:52:00] tongue let him have a
[1:52:01] taste because he's a priest and now has
[1:52:05] come behind the veil and he will have a
[1:52:07] taste to the original Mana at the
[1:52:09] beginning isn't that amazing God SED out
[1:52:13] that every generation could have the
[1:52:15] same taste of the same holy ghost that
[1:52:19] was out on the day of
[1:52:21] Pentecost amen and he said what's what's
[1:52:24] that got to do with Pentecost oh when
[1:52:26] they were all eating good with that good
[1:52:28] manner and screaming and shouting and
[1:52:31] carrying on like that like a bunch of
[1:52:33] drunk people watch somebody said what
[1:52:35] can we do and Peter said repent every
[1:52:37] one of you and be baptized in the name
[1:52:40] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:52:42] your sins and you shall receive the gift
[1:52:44] of the Holy Ghost father promises to you

[2:08:37] it too
[2:08:38] classy we just shake hands join the
[2:08:41] church say I believe the message you
[2:08:44] know might as well be sprinkled or
[2:08:45] baptized or something they're afraid of
[2:08:48] the the new
[2:08:49] birth brother Brandon told it about his
[2:08:52] own church he said I'm afraid brandham
[2:08:53] Tabernacle is afraid of the new birth he
[2:08:56] said you know we know what a birth is
[2:08:58] said I don't care what it is or where
[2:09:01] whereabouts it's a
[2:09:03] mess if a baby's born on a Chuck pile or
[2:09:06] on a hard floor a pink decorated
[2:09:08] hospital room it's a mess anyway a Caff
[2:09:11] a a birth of a c for birth of anything
[2:09:14] is a mess and a new birth is nothing
[2:09:15] less than a mess but people get so stue
[2:09:19] we'll go over where they shake hands
[2:09:21] we'll go over where they don't ball and
[2:09:23] cry and beat on the Altar and cry out he
[2:09:25] said you want to be too
[2:09:28] human I'll tell you being too human is
[2:09:30] what got you in the trouble you're
[2:09:32] in amen God wants a new birth on the
[2:09:35] inside where you're born not another
[2:09:37] human but a son and daughter of God
[2:09:40] filled with the spirit why he said don't
[2:09:43] be drunk on wine which is excess but be
