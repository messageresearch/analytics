to read from the book of Revelation the the second chapter tonight we're we're starting a new church age uh we are going to be studying the th tyan age it's the fourth Church age and we're going to study um a portion of that tonight so if you have your Bibles we're going to start in Revelation 2 and the the 18th verse it's so good to have all the young people out tonight and all those others all you others that have come out to support we're so thankful for your support tonight to have you here and it says in verse 18 and unto the angel of the church and thy Tower write these things saith the Son of God who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass I Know Thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first now notice there at the beginning of verse 19 that this isn't a typo it says I Know Thy works then it list and charity and service and faith and thy patience and then it says again and thy works and the last to be more than the first we'll get to that later on it says not withstanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols and I gave her space to repent for her fornication and she repented not behold I will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation except they repent of their deeds and I will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he which SE searches the Reigns of the hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your works but unto you I say and unto the rest of thy Tara as many as have not this Doctrine in which have not known the depths of Satan as they speak I will put upon you none other burden but that which ye have already hold fast till I come and he that overcometh and keepeth my Works unto unto the end to him will I give power over the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a Potter shall they be broken to Shivers even as I received of my father and I will give him the morning star and he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches amen may the Lord add His blessings to the word as you have your seats tonight amen give me just a moment so we are studying the the the fourth age the th Ty and Age and and we've always put a map up here so that you could place it in relation to the others we started here at at Ephesus and then we went to Smyrna and pergamus and now we've moved over just to the east to thara thar the age brother Brandon puts it as lasting from about 606 to 1520 ad and he says it it is the longest of of all the ages and we have just a few pictures here showing some of the surviving streets that the way it would look today this is uh what's left of of some of the streets there's not much of the this city left uh but there is there are a few um there are a few things there a few um ruins as it were is brother Bram says it's the least noteworthy of the Seven Cities of Revelation uh it was well off financially he talks about how there was a it was surrounded by rivers and there was lots of rivers there but but that all the rivers were full of leeches and so they were they weren't any good but but the city itself was well off financially and and it had a lot of different guilds uh or we might would use the word today unions and those unions there were there were Potters there were Tanners there were Weavers um Dyers and and robe makers there there's one that you've probably heard of in the Bible known as um known as Lydia and and Lydia in the Bible is called the seller of purple and and she was from this city it tells us in Acts 16 and in chapter 14 it says and a certain woman named LD a Sellar of purple of the city of thara which worshiped God heard us whose heart the L the Lord opened that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul and Lydia was actually Paul's first European convert now now as we know as we go into this each city is chosen by the spirit and it's chosen uh that City because the city has the the spirit spiritual elements of the age that it represents so so remember we're not studying a city we're studying an age but the city represents that age because of the spiritual elements that are there so so the spirit sees the spiritual condition of a certain city and then calls it out as the representation of a future age amen so in this case thara had the spiritual elements that would match those in the four age in tharra they worshiped Apollo Apollo Tyrus Apollo was the son God and he was next in power to his father who was Zeus he's known as the averter of evil he presided over religious law and also over atonement and brother brandham says he communicated his knowledge of the future and his father's will to men through the prophets and the or oracles so so we see right here at the very beginning that this city is is joined together with this the emperor worship cult that we covered last time and they have this fatherson element to their religion all right and and and that aligns perfectly with Rome's Trinity that by now has a complete strangle hold on all of Christianity the the religion of the city in tatara was was extremely brother Bram says remarkably powerful and it wasn't so much that it was powerful because of what It produced but it was powerful because if you'll remember just a moment ago we mentioned all the the trade uh guilds or the unions of potters and Tanners and Weavers and dyes and Rob makers in order to make your living operating in one of these guilds you had to belong to the temple worship of Apollo so if you didn't belong to their religion and you didn't belong to their Temple and you didn't accept the idols that they worshiped you weren't allowed to make a living you weren't allowed to have a job there within the city it sounds very familiar to those who don't have the mark of the beast are not going to be able to buy and sell so it's is it's using church and state and strong arming people into this false religion now as we as we go into this next part remember that the churches in the Bible that the Church in the Bible is given feminine characteristics and women in the Bible can be the type of of all things vulgar and foul but they can also be the type of all things clean and beautiful so so we we see this with the false church it's called the Great but then you find the True Vine is called the bride the Lamb's wife so the church is a woman false and true the church is a woman and amen and and so the name thara means dominating female we have none of those here tonight right good dominating female thus this age is characterized by a dominant force a force that ruthlessly invades all conquers all and despotically controls so if it's a dominating force and it means dominating female we know it's referencing a church but it's not referencing the true church it's referencing the false Vine Church I I if we can remember back to the Ephesian age and I want to go back there just a minute and I pulled something from there that the goddess in their Temple was shown as a wooden figure with iron bars for arms and brother Bram says she was simply an almost shapeless female figure that finally sunk into the block of wood from which she was carved and her two arms were formed of two simple bars of iron how perfectly this depicts the spirit of antichrist loosed in the first age there he was loosed in the midst of the people and yet took no shape as to alarm the people yet the two arms of iron bars showed that it was his intent to crush the work of God as he made his inroads listen it don't the devil don't always come out like brother Bram says here he he says it took no shape to alarm the people so so young people listen sometimes uh your parents may tell you you know don't do these things or the minister may say don't do these things and you look at it and go but what's the big deal I don't see the issue because it hasn't taken a shape yet to alarm you but your parents understand and the ministry understands that that there's things out there that comes in this way and this way and it may not look bad right now but but look at what it may become down the road and you have to trust the the leadership that's been placed in your life to protect you from those things but he says here these two arms of of iron bars showed that it was the intent to crush the work of God so now from the first age this church has grown in power to where she now rules with an iron disposition now as we as as we look at what kind of a disposition and nature that a woman should exhibit remember that it does not that it does relate to the Natural and it should be applied there um in the husband and wife relationship but also we're talking about the church and Christ and a spiritual relationship a woman is not supposed to have an iron disposition she is is to be meek gentle easily LED according to the scripture the woman is to be submissive to the man now I do want to stop and say this there's a lot of men that have some really twisted ideas about what submissive means all right it don't it don't mean that you get to rule over a woman with brute force it don't mean that you're going to do what I say and that it there's a scriptural submission that there there there it's in the scripture how how the man is to be the head of the household and the woman is is supposed to follow but but it also there supposed to follow you as you follow Christ and Christ isn't standing there saying you're going to do this or else that's that's not how this works but but but the church is to be submissive to God she is to be led by him brother Brown says women a woman who is truly female all female will be of that disposition not a doormat this isn't about M making someone a doormat it's something that brother Tim has always said in in marriage ceremonies that that that God took a rib from Adam something close to his heart not from his feet for him to tr over her and not from his head for her to rule over him but from the heart says not ad door door mat no real male makes a female a doormat but she will want to be under Authority and not rule over the male for he is the head of the house now if she breaks that image that God made for her she is perverted okay that's that's why it matters how you dress that's why it matters how you wear your hair that's why we don't uh wear clothes that pertain to a man because when a woman does those things she's invading into man's domain taking Authority and therefore according to the word it's a perversion but that goes for the men as well this isn't just a woman thing men you wear clothes that pertain to a woman you dress like a woman you act like a woman wear your hair like a woman let a woman run over you you are perverted this isn't a one-side preach at the women thing this gospel is for men and women God placed Us in certain positions and it's his order it's not for us to question that order it's for us to line up to that order it's for us to come into submission to that order prophet of God says being a dominating female is Antichrist and the seeds of the Roman Catholic Church are in her though she may deny this ever so vinant but when it comes to the word let God be true and every man's word a lie amen let God's word be true and every man's word a lie so even in like Tabernacle young people we are to be submissive to the word it is what supposed we're not supposed to argue with it well I don't understand we're not to be dominating the word says it that's what we come subject to not to debate it not to try to overrule it but we're supposed to come subject to it we're not to have an iron dis disposition of well nobody's going to tell me what to do nobody's going to run my life that's not the right attitude and what we see here is the dominating female in the fourth age is the Roman Catholic church and she doesn't care what his word says she still doesn't care what his word says she's an independent liberated female doing what she pleases but not the True Vine not the Bride of Jesus Christ we love his every word we long to to for his approval we care what the bridegroom thinks we come subject and that is our disposition we we can't young people identify with that that dominating Spirit of the church who does as she pleases that can't that can't be us and and and they lay aside the word here and run over the word there and and cast aside the word every place that it displeases her but that woman is drunk on the blood of the Saints she is Mystery Babylon and an Abomination before God but the bride but the bride that's who we're talking about this is the other Church the Bride of Jesus Christ she is submissive to her head she allows the word to judge her listen what what what is the house of God it's the beginning of judgment we don't come here to have our ears tickled and leave oh I sometimes that happens sometimes you get built up built up but the word judges us and because we're not of that Spirit of dominating we take it and we say yes Lord change my life to match that word we have come subject to the word and because of that the Bride of Jesus Christ is exalted to heaven and shares the very Throne of God as his Queen and in this th Ty in church age she we're talking about churches not people here is a dominating female she is Mystery Babylon she is the great she is Jezebel the false prophetess why because the true female is submissive to God Christ is her head she has no word but his no thoughts but his no leadership but his but what about this church talking about the false one she is has cast out the word destroyed the Bibles and worthy essays of The Godly she has slain those who would preach the truth so so in this age not only has she been seduced but now she is seducing others brother brandom actually goes so far as to say she is the Bride of Satan and for 900 years during the length of this church age she destroys all who dare to stand in her way truth is is almost completely gone there's a reason this is known as the Dark Ages the light had gone out not even not just Gospel Light but but even the sciences and the things of that nature it had all been crushed out light was gone it was the Dark Ages she dominated kingdoms she dominated the world he says there was a little group there was a little group who belonged to God and their citizenship was in heaven and them she could not destroy God kept his little flock they could not be destroyed listen the seed couldn't be destroyed then and that seed can't be destroyed today it may be the most wicked age it may be the darkest age it may be the worst evil time we've ever come in but there is still a little flock standing on the earth to day that will not bow they will not Bend they will not give in to to what's popular or what's modern but what are we subject to we're subject subject to the word and because of that his hand is Upon Our Lives listen people are giving their mind to the Beast people are giving their hearts to the beast but there's a people today that are given their minds and their hearts have been turned back to the word and that's where we stand that and listen it may be dark but there is a light shining it may be dark but there's a people standing saying there is a truth there is a baptism of the Holy Ghost there is salvation there is a God and this God cares how we live amen there's a people whose hearts and Minds have been turned back now as we began studying these ages we we know that there was a key that brother Bram said he used to to know the messengers of each age and he says the key given to me of the Lord whereby I was able to determine the messenger for each age is a most scriptural one in fact it might be called the Keystone of the Bible it is the Revelation that God never changes and that his ways are as unchangeable as he is in Hebrews 138 it says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever what he did at the first he will have to keep on doing until it is done for the last time there will never be a change apply that to the church ages he says the kind of man that God chose for the first age and how God manifested in that man's Ministry is an example for all other ages what God did in the first church age is what he wants to do in all other ages so when brother brandham looks at this age he actually says that there were two men in this age whose Ministry stood this test he said one was St Patrick and the other St Columba he says but it was Colum who was the messenger of the age and and brother brandham takes a little time here in the midst of it to to battle against the idea that St Patrick was in any way part of the Catholic system and he comes in he say he says even though he wasn't the messenger he he he wants his name cleared of that he wants his name cleared as a real man of God who who stood for truth and who stood against what the church had become he says he had a wonderful Ministry full of signs and wonders and led thousands to the Lord there in Ireland he goes on to say at no time did he ever go to Rome nor at any time was he commissioned by Rome so he says that about St Patrick but he says St Columba was the messenger now Columba was born in Northern Ireland he was born to royalty and one of the things that that that says about him is he committed the the scripture to memory and and he went out spreading the gospel over o over today what we know as as Scotland now Columbus conversion when he was called into the ministry he was called by an audible voice and it said that after that nothing could stop him listen young people let that be your testimony today you've been called in this hour by a message you've heard a voice in this day call your name and call you and commission you to be the Overcomers of the last age and I say it ought to be the testimony that there's nothing that can stop us let Temptations arise let let lukewarmness come let let problems in the church come but there's a group who says nothing is going to stop me I've been called I've heard my name I've seen my name in the book and no matter who falls left Who falls right who falls away who quits I'm not going to be stopped because I've heard my name called amen just like The Messengers before him Columbus Ministry was was full of the supernatural so much so that many have claimed his ministry was right there next to the apostles brother brandham says this and I love this quote he says how we thank you for great St Paul of Ephesus how we thank you for irenius oh Lord irenius the great servant of yours and for St Martin and tonight for St Columba Lord how we thank you for these men in the midst of dark romanism paganism coming in the church they stood Gallant for the Pentecostal message and blessing and speaking in tongues and great signs and wonders and the healing of the sick and raising of the Dead listen once again I say that we should stand for the Pentecostal blessing for the Pentecostal message that God is still a supernatural God I mean the prophet of God stood there and said we thank you oh Lord that there were men who stood for the message of the supernatural I say there's still people standing for the message of the supernatural when to so many God is just a cold Creed or or something formal but we say today no he is aive he is well he is moving he is healing he is saving he's delivering he's still setting people free because he's a supernatural God and he's leading a supernatural people scholars in the earliest early 20th century would write about Columba this man not necessarily a skeptic but also not believing everything he' read says this but in whatever we may regard the Miracles attributed to Columba and they are very numerous they show the absolute faith that the people had in him they called him the angel of the Lord and realize that he lived on a higher plane than they did so Columbo would go about spreading the gospel and one of the ways that he would do this was he would send out teams of 12 and in the midst of those teams you would have some Carpenters some teachers some preachers and they would come and they would build a small town and they would enclose that town with a fence or a wall and here they would begin to teach and preach the gospel as more came in and more people came to these towns they would begin to train others to go out and do the exact same thing that they had done and they would move and build a little community and and allow the people to come to them and I love what brother Brown says about the way they did it and it's something we can take great note of he says instead of attacking other religions they taught the truth for they believed that the truth was weapon enough to accomplish the ends that God had in mind for them listen we don't have to attack everything and everybody all you got to do is just preach the truth just teach the truth now sometimes the truth may may seem like it's attacking if it's going against something that you believe but the truth is when it comes to the word of God let God's word be the truth and every man's word a lie but we don't have to go out of our way to slander this and attack this just preach the truth just live the truth brother Brown says that they were a free work moving under the message of the hour totally free from Rome the salutation we find in Revelation 2 and8 says these things saith the Son of God who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass notice it says these things saith the son of God the revelation of the godhead in this age to that age was that Jesus is the son of God and and brother Bram speaks about this part here in great detail how that in the flesh he was the son of man but now he's no longer in the flesh but he's back in the bosom of the father and he's risen and now we know him not in the flesh but we know him by the power of his resurrection and in this position of his mighty power he is above all all and he is over all he has conquered all and and and and because of this he alone deserves the praise he alone deserves all the glory and all the honor and he expects to be in full control and full leadership of his church that is his expectation he didn't conquer death Hell In The Grave Just to surrender the leadership of his church over to men he didn't come and take on flesh and fight all those battles and redeem mankind just to turn over that leadership to man but what is it that we see here in the fourth age that there the city of tharra is representing the fourth age what is it we see in tharra Apollo is being revered as the Son of God showing us that in the fourth age the church is giving the glory and the honor and the praise that belongs to the true Son of God to another the praise that's supposed to be going to Jesus is now going to another and the scripture says his eyes burn like unto a flame so the religion of the tharan age has elevated the pope to deity now if you don't believe that you can read the writings of Thomas aquinus where he says the pope seems to those who view him with the spiritual I to be not a man but a god there are no bounds to his authority he can declare to be right what he will and can take away from any their rights as he sees fit to doubt this Universal Power leads to being shut out from salvation now there's only salvation in one there's only salvation in Jesus Christ so what's happening here is is a man is being elevated to take the the glory and the honor and the power that belongs to Jesus and he's looking at it and his eyes are flaming I don't know what that means to you but it tells me he is extremely angry he's very angry the church is placing salvation in the hands of a man and not in Jesus Christ the scripture tells us in 1 Timothy 2:5 for there is one God and one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus who gave himself a ransom for all I want to tell you tonight and remind you there is but one way to Salvation I am the way the truth the life no man cometh unto the father but by me there's no church no Prophet no preacher nobody that can give you salvation but the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ is where our Salvation lies he is the way he is the truth he's the life I want to encourage you toight if you haven't found your salvation in Jesus if you're still at that place get into Jesus tonight but don't I need to know about this and knowbody just fall in love with Jesus what do I need to do just ask Jesus for salvation you don't got to come to me you don't got to come to some man through some certain Church you just find Jesus he is the one he's the only one that can give you salvation brother Brown says no wonder the feet are like fine brass as he stands ready to trample into powder and dust the wicked kingdoms of this world so the false Vine has put the Pope in place of Jesus and they've established and enforced idol worship under Empress theod Empress Theodora alone from 1842 to 1867 over 100,000 saints were killed killed because they reputed the images of no value in other words they said those Idols aren't our Gods we don't have to bow to that that's that's not what the scripture says that's not what the word says and just for that stand they were slaughtered just in this short period of 25 years over a 100,000 are killed and yet just like in every age before the True Vine stood and just like in every age our God remain faithful to those who would stand the false Vine maybe has Cast Away his word the false Vine says it don't matter they rejected his leadership but the True Vine stands and to the True Vine he says fear not little flock it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom and when I come with feet of brass and flaming eyes I will recompense judgment is mine I will repay saith the Lord comes to the eulogy re Revelation 2 verse 19 he says I Know Thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first now he said this in every age and I'm going to slow down a little bit I've I was going pretty fast there for a while intentionally knowing we have other things to do but I've gotten far enough along I can slow down he says this to every age I Know Thy Works he says this in every Age and and works is something that Jesus spoke about even in his own Ministry when he said believe me for the very Works sake and I know and you know that we don't lay our faith in our works no man has done enough works or could ever do enough works to Merit salvation we don't lay our faith in works that's not where our faith lies but the life and Ministry of Christ produced Works did it not then what should happen with a believer that has the same life living on the inside of them if that life walk in the shores of Galilee produce works and we claim to have that same life living in us should it not produce the same thing so it's not where our faith lies but but what does Paul say there in in Ephesians he says for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them so so good works will not save you but they will come forth out of a saved life as fruit unto the Lord so just because you have good work Works doesn't mean you're saved but if you're saved you will have good works it will be the fruits of the spirit that manifest themselves that there should be a harvest of good works that come out of a Christian's life I'm G to say it again good works don't make you a Christian but a Christian will have good works but what what we see with Rome in this age is what God detests men doing evil works and claiming to be doing the will of God he says they were killing maming and doing all manner of evil in the name of the Lord they lived out lives exactly opposite to what the word teaches in that evil day those True Believers Shone like a light in a dark place as they continually did good listen I say the same is true to today today the real believer is shining in the darkness it's easier to shine today than it's ever been there may be a time if you go back a hundred years or 200 years where a Christian could walk down the street and blend in with the unbelievers that's not the case anymore your life should be shining brighter than ever because it's darker than it's ever been don't be one running around living wrong and claiming to be right don't be blending in with the age because in this age it's never been so easy for your light to shine I I'll put it like this young people it should be obvious that you are a Christian it should be obvious your dress should declare that you are a Christian but let's take it beyond that because sometimes we get right there and we well I dress right okay your attitude should declare that you are a Christian the way you treat people should declare that you are a Christian your words should declare that you are a Christian listen I I I I I'm I'm not that guy that's going to come down on catchphrases and all this we all get caught up in we we say things that are common to our day okay but if your conversations sound exactly like the conversations of the world something is wrong right there should be a difference what you feed on should declare that you are a Christian and your good works should declare that you are a Christian God cares about our works he says to each age I Know Thy works it mattered enough for him to put it in the word I know what you're doing I know how you're living I know the the the testimony that your life is is saying out there to the world you're saying you're a Christian but I know your Works you're saying you've been changed but I know your works now in this part though he's saying it in a way that he is commending the Believers he's saying I know your Works you're doing a good job I see the life that you're living he's commending them for living changed lives and their works are testifying of a new life on the inside well I have the Holy Ghost brother Aaron does the way you treat people declare you have the Holy Ghost well I've been born again does your attitude declare that you've been born again if if I didn't look at the way you were dressed and I only judged it off of your attitude and your words would I know do your Works declare that you've been born again he says yes sir if you are a Christian you are going to do what is right it's not a struggle because if you're a Christian it means the life of Jesus is on the inside of you living out through you and you're going to do what is right your Works will show that your heart is right this is where you get into people who say things like God don't look on the outside he looks on the inside absolutely but what's on the inside will always manifest on the outside that is a law that's not argument that that's not disputable what's in here Will manifest out here it won't be something that you put on for you will do his will when no one but God sees you and you will do his will even if it cost you your life notice after Works he goes straight to charity know word for charity is is love he says because without love our works are not EX accepted before God and neither is our service let me put that to you in a way you can understand if you're doing it begrudgingly if you're doing it because you have to I have to do this it's not accepted you have to do it without love our works are not accepted he says now you can see right here that these Believers because remember he's commending them for their their works and their charity weren't in that nickan class that did works as a means of Salvation or to be admired by men we don't do good works so people will think good of us our work should flow out of our life because the Life of Christ is in our life that's what it is the love of God has been shed abroad in our hearts and that is what is driving them to the good works not well I have to do this not rules not regulations but the love of God living out of your life and living for others just like Christ did that's why brother Brandon would say that eternal life is living for others what did Jesus eternal life do when he came to promote himself and and do what he wanted to do and build you know his big Earthly Kingdom and and have a wife and family and live a life of no eternal life came and lived for you eternal life came and gave himself for you eternal life life is living for others so when the Life of Christ is on the inside of you eternal life then you can't help but put others first well I struggle with that get more of Jesus you can't help but put others first to serve others live for others because that's what that life does that life is not a selfish life so what happens I'm not saying you don't have Jesus what I'm saying is you're letting your selfish nature override the life that's trying to live out of you you got to take control of that bring your life your thoughts your ideas subject to the word of God and say no we're not here to be selfish we're here to give our life for other people you you you so love others because it's the love of Christ and it testifies to the world what What did the what did the pagans say when they witnessed this life in the early CHR Christians in the early Christians they said behold how they love each other it was so manifested that other people noticed it they lived for others so much that the pagans had to testify look at how much they love one another and if the pagans or the heathens or whoever you want to put there had the opportunity to sit in on our conversations about our brothers and sisters would they walk away and go my how they love each other' or would they go man they don't even like them people they go to the same church they're the same religion or would they walk away and say my how they love each other at this point brother Brown says he wants to give a warning and he references Matthew 24 and 12 says and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold now we know that we're in the age of Le oosa it's an age where the spirit promotes selfishness self-love the love of pleasure the love of material things and and then the spirit of this age makes people say It's All About Me Maybe you don't say it but you live that way it's all about me it's what benefits me what makes me comfortable what gets me more things and the spirit of the age causes you to harden your hearts to the needs and the feelings of others and not only that it caused you to harden your heart to your own spiritual needs and pursuit of what makes you feel good right now he says so many are getting so hard because they haven't realize the effect of this last day spirit it's time to draw n to God and let him fill our lives with his love what' he say right there so many are getting so hard young people don't be a part of the so many don't don't don't be a part of that but but but be like the True Vine there in the darkness of the fourth age who held on to their love of God and held on to their love for each other listen you I hate to use the word have to but you're going to have to fight for it because in this age it's easy to get bitter at people get mad at people get upset at people that's human nature it's going to happen you got to be willing to lay it down and let that love override those feelings you're going to have to fight for it one thing you're going to notice throughout your life and I'll testify for me I don't want to put it on you but I'll say for me is as your relationship with the Lord cools so does your feelings for your brothers and sisters you're on fire for God you love everybody and you're willing to overlook the things about them that you just don't like but get cool on God and all of a sudden that person irritates you to know in all of a sudden every little thing about every little service drives you nuts and you're frustrated at this and that and it's because your own personal relationship has waxed cold when you're on fire for him you're on fire for his people you'll fight for his people you'll love his people you'll care about his people what it is is it's the age trying to cool you off so what am I encouraging you to do look fall in love with Jesus all over again I'm not saying you got to go back and do all the first works over I'm saying stop for a minute and recognize where am I what is this about why did I start this my I used to be so in love with him well then fall in love love with him again remember what it was when your sins were forgiven remember what it was when he came and lifted those burdens away remember what that time was like remember where you were going and where you were headed when you were going to a sinner's grave in a devil's hell and he turned your life around and don't grow cold on him when he gave his life for you fall in love with Jesus all over again and then with that love for your fellow man and your brothers and your sisters it'll begin to flow out of you you won't have to force it God goes on to say to him Jesus says I know your service now when he says that we want that to be a positive statement not a negative when he says that to you I know your service you better hope that's a positive thing not I know your service and it's a negative thing I know what you have done what you haven't done he says I know your service Jesus said he that is greatest of all is servant to all now pay attention to this because this is something that this age doesn't like even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister so we are to follow that example see him as he bows himself over the feet of the Apostles and washes their tired and dirty feet he said you don't know what I'm doing but you will know Hereafter but what you see me doing you ought also to do now listen true he's literally washing their feet and true we carry out that ordinance but it was about more than that it was about being a servant it was about humbling yourself humbling your opinion of I'm above that why should I have to do that listen the footwash flunky was the lowest of the low in that society and Jesus said I'll do it for my brother I I'll do that and he humbled himself to to to show us to do the work of a servant well well what's that mean brother that well that can take on many different things first of all quit thinking about yourself reach out to others help someone else along the way make their day lighter lighten their load recognize others needs over yours think about their needs and don't always focus on your own listen we all have needs we all have problems we all have issues we all have situations we all have struggles but what this is about is listen you don't think he had problems he was fixing to suffer the most cruel death ever it' been easy for him to say boys pull up a chair let me tell you all about what's is going to happen to me and how this last last three and a half years has been such a struggle and how nobody's believed me and they've rejected me and I've been all y y'all sit down and listen but he said no let me serve you let me take time to serve you so what what am I saying it lay your struggles and your needs down long enough to be a servant to others be a good listener sometimes that's what people people need but this ain't rocket science this ain't algebra it's not difficult sometimes people don't need advice sometimes people don't need to know what you think they need somebody to listen and care and lay aside your selfishness be be an ear where somebody can unload their burdens but we get so selfish that all we want to do is unload our burdens what is it at the end of the journey that we're all Longing To Hear well done my good and faithful servant that that doesn't just mean that you served him how okay it means you serve god well then how do we serve him what you've done to the least of these my little ones you have done unto me serving God is about serving his people it's about being a servant as brother brandham said those who long to be served those who want recognition those who want to be seated at the head of the table will always go down in shame we are to be servants but that's not easy to hear in this age where it's all about get what you can while you can and build your wealth and do this and look out for you that's not the attitude of the Christian attit of a Christian is who can I help who can I reach out to who who can I lighten their load I know thy faith and thy patience and this point in the scripture he's commending them for their faithfulness not necessarily U like like his faith like they're holding on to the faith but the word here is for their faithfulness in other words they've been steadfast they've been true they've been faithful he he says I know thy faith and faithfulness and patience go together we see that in James 1 and three knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience so patience is the outcome of faithfulness I hate to tell you this but there is no other way to gain patience than by the trying of your faith that's it and we need patience so you're going to be tried I I I think it's one of the most lacking things in this entire age because we want things now we want reward now we want you to respond now and and and what's the saying somebody read your text and you can tell they read it and they didn't write you back right away what they left me on red why didn't they respond right now well why don't you go back 20 years and write a letter and have to wait a week for them to respond but this age where used to type it they respond do this they respond do that put something in the microwave your meal comes out they they want it now they want success now and it carries over to our spiritual life and we'll get down and pray and open our eyes to see if it happened well it could sure but he also wants to see if you'll hold on and continue praying and knock and keep on knocking and he wants to see that if your patience has been how's he going to do it by trying your faith to see if you'll still hold on to see if you'll stand a test of time and that develops your character he says how highly God regards this outworking of our patience as seen in James 1 and4 but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire lacking nothing God's will for us is perfection and that Perfection is patience wow waiting on God and waiting for God what is that that's character development having to wait for something it's not something that this age is used to and and God looks at these Saints in the fourth age praying for deliverance praying that God would move holding on every single day people being massacred by the millions or by the thousands and he's watching them patient as Lambs led to the slaughter lovingly Faithfully they serve God that is all they wanted out of life just service to their lord how great was to be their reward in other words they never even got their reward here I there there's nothing wrong with striving for things here on Earth but it's time we turn our attention to that reward and quit being so impatient you may not even receive your reward here but how great will your reward be there turn your attention and look for that reward tonight look away from the rewards that the Earth and and that the world can give you we mentioned this early on in the study where he says I know thy Works he' already said that at the beginning I Know Thy works and now he comes back again at the very end of this at the end of the same verse and says I Know Thy works and the last to be more than the first and what we have to understand is this is in the time of Inquisition where there was more blood shed than at any other time except for the Reformation if you were a Christian and you weren't going with exactly what the Catholic Church said you were in danger of death every moment of every day but during this time he says I Know Thy works and the last to be more than the first in other words you got stronger as the age went on you were standing stronger at the End of the Age than you were at the beginning of the age he says as the darkness of the age increased as the honor role of the martyrs grew lengthier day by day they worked all the harder they served all the more and their faith increased their faith didn't decrease they didn't get weaker at the struggle and why am I going through this and God why why they said no we're going to press harder we're going to serve more we're going to give him more of ourselves and here in leosa well it seems like it's worse than ever I say press harder push for more giveing more of your life surrender more of who you are how awesome is it that God can look at it in the darkness of the Dark Ages death all around and they served him all the more things are getting worse they're getting stronger things are getting harder they're getting more faithful and at the end their works then were greater than at the beginning there was no waning away there was no slipping back into lukewarmness but growing stronger day after day to the point that it was there labors that would pave the way and open up the way for the oncoming Reformation the reform didn't come on the scene in the in the next age just barely stumbling in but these people had pushed and pushed and pushed and their faith was stronger and stronger and it made the way for the Reformation to take place what about your faith what about the life you're living are you making a way for the Rapture are you in a situation where God's having to go come on we got to get your faith up come on get your faith up you got to start believing again or is there people saying we're going to push harder we're going to push more and you're going to push so much and get so much stronger that you actually make a way for for the resurrection that your faith makes way for the Rapture of the church that's a testimony of these people then we bring ourselves to the rebuke I think I need to go back on says notwithstanding Revelations 2 and 20 I have a few things against thee now notice and we're going to this on the next slide we've said it ever since the first age that there's two Vines so when he gives all this Accolade I see your works I see your faith I see your patience and then he says I have a few things against thee we should have the understanding that even though he's addressing them all as the church he was speaking to the True Vine and now he's speaking to the false I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed to Idols does this sound like something that the True Vine would be doing no it's the false Vine so what we find here is we know that there's two vines or two churches and he speaks to both of them in each age as though they are one but let's drop down to verse 23 this is just three verses later and he says and I will kill her children with death and all the churches plural there's more than one all the churches shall know that I am he which searches the Reigns in the hearts so obviously without even getting into it doctrinally it's easy to see that there are some churches that don't know he's the one that searches the Reigns and the hearts they don't know that why because they're given all their love and affection and glory to a man they've turned away from the true and living God and he says I will kill her children with death and all the churches will know in other words those that don't know right now they're going to know they're going to find out because apparently there's some of them that don't understand that he is the one but they're going to so what church could it be that doesn't know this truth the one that that has looked away from Christ and is now placing all his power into the hands of a man the false Church the Catholic church now he hadn't talking here to the same ones who he just commended for all their works and all their love brother brandham says of course it's the false Vine group because the True Believers certainly know that judgment begins at the house of God and they being God-fearing judge themselves that they be not judge why do we preach the hard truths why do we say things that are cutting so we can take the word and judge ourselves with it that we be not judged on that day judge yourself now allow the word to judge you don't let what you think judge you don't let you you know well this church says well that church well I'm thankful for every church but you better let the word judge you and not what a church says judge you he says now why does God call these churches his churches even though they are the false Vine because they are Christians but they're not Christians of the spirit they're Christians of the Flesh in other words they are bearing the name in vain what's it say in Mark 7 and7 how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of who men in other words it never says it never says they're not at church worshiping me it doesn't say that at all he says they're worshiping me they are worshiping me and he's saying they're doing it in vain listen Cain was a worshipper you say it doesn't matter as long as you worship God then why did he say what he said to Cain Cain built an altar we know what an altar is it's just it's a church place of worship Cain built a church Cain brought a beautiful sacrifice and God looked at and said nope won't accept it and he looks at Abel's and says but I'll accept that now he does he send Cain away straight to hell no he says hey don't be angry just do what your brother's doing he showed you it's in the word just do what he's doing and you'll be accepted too you tell people that they're worshiping wrong and they'll respond just like Cain did he didn't go oh awesome let me go over here and worship with Abel he was so mad about it he killed him yeah you can see that Cain Spirit rise up in people when you point out things in that that they're doing that isn't right according to the word not according to our opinion so he says and we're bringing this down to a close he says in the same way now remember they're Christians but he says in the same way a Christian is a Christian as long as he subscribes to the fact that Jesus is the son of God born born of a virgin was crucified and died and rose again that he is savior of mankind Etc he says he is a nominal Christian and belongs to the church but he is not a true or spiritual believer when do you become a true or spiritual believer when you accept All the Right doctrines no when you're born again when you receive the the the New Birth when you receive the Holy Ghost but he says that kind of a Believer is one who has been baptized in the body of Christ and is a member of him but nonetheless it is in God's order that the tears grow up with the wheat and they are not to be uprooted that is the command of God their day for binding and burning is coming but not yet he says so the spirit is speaking to a mix mixed group here in this fourth age on the one hand he is praising it's the True Vine and on the other he is rebuking he has told what is right with the True Believer and now he warns what the false Vine must do if it is to stand Justified before the Lord in other words just like with Cain he didn't send them away he said here's what you must do if you want to be justified before the Lord and so I ask you tonight as we bring this study to a close when the spirit speaks what did you hear as you sat here tonight did you hear yourself prais for your works for your patience for your love or has the word rebuked you do you find yourself tolerating things of this world as he said you tolerate Jezebel do you find yourself tolerating a lukewarm walk do you find yourself tolerating sin he says of the false Vine I gave her space to repent and she would not and he tries to enter in but he finds himself shut out if your life isn't testifying I'm not talking about about your words I'm not just talking about your dress I'm not but your life isn't testifying of him tonight and he's knocking at your door don't turn him away don't lock him out well but there was a lot of things you said tonight that that I don't line up with exactly so so does that mean I don't have the Holy Ghost no we all need more we all have places where we come face to face with the word and we go I'm I'm not matching up to that and instead of turning away and going but I'm good enough that's the attitude of the false Vine the True Vine says Lord whatever I got to do to match that right there I see I'm falling short but Lord there's something in me that says I know I can be that I know I can match that I know you'll give me the power and if you see yourself not matching up don't don't turn away we all have space to grow we all have places to repent do not ever get to a place in your Christian wal that you don't think you have to repent or that you'll never have need to repent or say I was wrong or I saw that wrong or I acted wrong we all have space to repent and tonight he offers once again space to repent so that on that day when we stand there we will all hear the exact same thing well done my good and faithful servant will you bow your head with me this evening he says I Know Thy Works he says I've seen your faith I've seen your patience listen young people old people middle-aged people he sees where we're at he sees the struggle he sees how difficult the age is he sees the darkness of the age but he hasn't left you here alone he hasn't forsaken you you say well I've been falling short brother Aon that means I the devil said it means I didn't get nothing the devil's a liar don't let him take what God's done for you away just recognize where you fall short and say God I need more God I need a a greater walk I need another refilling I need you to take me a step higher Lord I I I don't want to be like those that when they come face to face with the word instead of changing they turn and walk away from it but tonight he's offering space look the word was was cutting and and and clear tonight there are things that should come out of the lives of a Christian and I'll sit here with my hand up and say I know I haven't brought forth a full Harvest of every single one of those things I know there's places I look at and I I could give more I I could surrender more I I I could love people more I I I I could do more for Jesus and my hands up saying Lord Purge me I I don't want you to be there like that last picture knocking on my door and I'm sitting there saying I'm good enough I've got enough I I'm saved but he's saying he wants to give you more tonight he wants to take you up another level he wants to take you up higher to where all things are possible to where people know that you're a Christian you don't have to tell them Christ lives out of you he lives out of you in your relationship with your friends he lives out of you in your relation relationship with your parents he lives out of you in your relationship with people that you don't like Lord fill me so full of the Holy Ghost that it can be said like like it was of brother brandham that you couldn't tell his friends from his enemies I got a long way to go but my hands up saying Lord I'm willing if that's where you're at tonight you're willing will you just stand to your feet and say Lord I'm willing as we worship him tonight for just a moment before we dismiss this service just let him know you're willing that's what he's looking for he's looking for Willing Hearts he's looking for people who want to be molded who want to be made who want to be changed what's God have for me what what God want me to do what am I supp brother he wants you willing just be willing tonight Lord father we come before you and Lord our hearts CES we're willing Lord the young people of evening light Tabernacle we're willing the ministry of evening night Tabernacle the moms
