[1:03:00] increased amen I I pray that it'll be
[1:03:04] until it actually becomes rapturing
[1:03:07] Faith amen and the Lord said if you had
[1:03:11] Faith as a grain of mustard seed you
[1:03:14] might say to this sycamine tree be thou
[1:03:18] plucked up by the root and be thou
[1:03:21] planted in the sea and it should obey
[1:03:24] you amen what powerful words from our
[1:03:30] savior this morning amen God bless you
[1:03:33] can be seated I'm must to be speaking on
[1:03:34] the mountain movers connected to the
[1:03:39] Dynamo
[1:03:40] amen you know we've been discovering in
[1:03:44] some of the services I preached all in
[1:03:48] the last few weeks of how the disciples
[1:03:51] struggled with
[1:03:53] doubt and when they were confronted by
[1:03:56] that stubborn demon that would not obey
[1:03:58] their
[1:03:58] commands and Jesus would tell them it
[1:04:01] was simply because of their unbelief
[1:04:04] there was no nothing wrong with the
[1:04:06] word there was nothing wrong with the
[1:04:08] promise of God and for those of you that
[1:04:11] have been here you know I'm referring to
[1:04:14] where the disciples tried to deliver a
[1:04:18] demonic child a child that had a demon
[1:04:22] rather and and um this Spirit would
[1:04:25] throw it in Into the Fire and tried to
[1:04:27] destroy its life and and uh you know the
[1:04:31] father wanted it delivered and brought
[1:04:32] it to his disciples and as he said they
[1:04:35] couldn't cure him and of course Jesus
[1:04:38] found them uh confronted by a crowd you
[1:04:42] know that was uh around and and no doubt
[1:04:46] um with the crowd uh uh there was a lot
[1:04:48] of unbelief there and as they begin to
[1:04:53] scream out their their questions and
[1:04:55] questioning the disciples and we we saw
[1:04:59] and know their faith just kind of wilted
[1:05:02] where um they began to listen to the
[1:05:06] questioning of of
[1:05:09] unbelief and and of course um you know
[1:05:14] Jesus after delivering the boy he would
[1:05:17] he would um be asked the disciples why
[1:05:22] couldn't we deliver him why why couldn't
[1:05:25] we cast out this devil and and again as
[1:05:30] we look at it we believe and and know
[1:05:32] that Satan anointed the crowd with
[1:05:35] unbelief their arguments against the
[1:05:38] power of God and it just caused the
[1:05:40] disciples Faith to wilt in front of the
[1:05:44] challenge and of course listening to the
[1:05:46] crowd today will will cause Faith to
[1:05:50] turn to doubt because the crowd I'm
[1:05:54] talking about these words were in that
[1:05:56] day were they were they were um the
[1:05:59] people of Jehovah they should have
[1:06:01] believed the crowd had many examples of
[1:06:06] healings and deliverances and you know
[1:06:09] of God provision and and the dead being
[1:06:12] raised and the Red Sea open and all
[1:06:15] kinds of things they had every reason in
[1:06:18] the world to
[1:06:19] believe but here they comes with
[1:06:21] questions and with doubt and and these
[1:06:24] voices from the crowd they begin to say
[1:06:28] things like you know healing and
[1:06:31] miracles are only for a certain season
[1:06:34] this would only be when Elijah was here
[1:06:37] this was only could happen when Moses
[1:06:39] was here and we're just simply not in
[1:06:41] that season you know there and of course
[1:06:44] that's just a disguise way of saying
[1:06:47] that the days of Miracles are passed and
[1:06:49] the apostolic age is over you know many
[1:06:53] times people will hear of the Rev
[1:06:55] Revival that we have and and we do have
[1:06:58] a Revival it's the bride's Revival and
[1:07:02] and as I've said but we didn't start it
[1:07:05] it came because of the opening of The
[1:07:07] Seven Seals and the mysteries of God
[1:07:10] being revealed in this day and and it
[1:07:13] has caused a Revival and a and a
[1:07:16] restoration back to the word of God
[1:07:18] again and and so you but many will hear
[1:07:22] they will they will hear of Revival and
[1:07:24] they will say oh that's that's just a
[1:07:26] season your church is going through it's
[1:07:28] just a a time you know you know I I've
[1:07:32] been through these cycles and and it's
[1:07:34] just ups and downs and in and out and
[1:07:37] and so there always comes doubt as to
[1:07:40] saying why we can't have Revival why we
[1:07:43] can't have the moving of the spirit or
[1:07:46] or it's just going to blow away or it's
[1:07:48] going to it's the the fire will burn out
[1:07:51] well I'll tell you what I mean I've been
[1:07:53] preaching for 50s something years and I
[1:07:56] ain't burned down yet and I ain't
[1:07:58] planning on burning out amen say I had a
[1:08:02] group of ministers call me up one time
[1:08:04] and said brother Tim we need you for a
[1:08:05] seminar and we would like you to speak
[1:08:08] on preacher burnout I said I don't know
[1:08:10] what it means I have never burned out
[1:08:13] and I ain't going to burn out there's a
[1:08:15] fire burning on the inside of me it it
[1:08:18] sits down a little low I just put more
[1:08:20] of the word of God on
[1:08:22] it amen so you see it's a fire as
[1:08:27] Jeremiah said I I would hold it back but
[1:08:30] I can't hold it back because it's a fire
[1:08:33] shut up in my bones and that's the way
[1:08:36] that it ought to be with every child of
[1:08:38] God a Revival that'll last you all the
[1:08:41] way to the
[1:08:42] [Applause]
[1:08:44] rapture we don't have to be up and down
[1:08:46] and in and out just because of trials
[1:08:48] and tribulations and seasons and times
[1:08:51] and and all of that we can we can have a
[1:08:53] a constant life with Christ Living every
[1:08:57] day in the holiest of holies in the
[1:08:59] presence of the Shina Glory eating of
[1:09:02] the Mana that never never goes stale or
[1:09:06] runs
[1:09:07] out the voice of accusation from the
[1:09:10] crowd shouts but you should not seek
[1:09:14] signs well that's a true statement it's
[1:09:18] often used as excuse why there are not
[1:09:20] signs following the
[1:09:23] Believers and while this B is frothing
[1:09:26] on the ground and under you know here he
[1:09:29] is under the power of the devil the
[1:09:31] crowd is screaming all he needs is the
[1:09:34] word because that which is perfect has
[1:09:37] come and we got the perfect word that's
[1:09:39] all you need you know we we don't need
[1:09:41] gifts of the Spirit that that was for a
[1:09:42] different season because now we have the
[1:09:45] full words and all such gifts as
[1:09:48] healings and workings of Miracles and
[1:09:50] prophecy are not pass and obsolete so
[1:09:53] just give him the word you know read a
[1:09:55] scripture send him a
[1:09:58] quote well you know that's just another
[1:10:01] way of saying the days of Miracles are
[1:10:03] passed because really it's an excuse for
[1:10:06] the crowd as to why God is no longer
[1:10:10] among
[1:10:11] us it keeps them from having to do some
[1:10:14] soul
[1:10:15] searching it excuses their leot to see
[1:10:18] and lukewarm condition of being rich
[1:10:20] increased with goods and God I really
[1:10:22] don't need you we got it all
[1:10:26] but I just I just want you to know when
[1:10:29] we when we have the true word there's a
[1:10:32] power with
[1:10:34] it now there was a reason for these
[1:10:37] disciples not having perfect faith and
[1:10:40] of course we know Jesus said it's
[1:10:42] because of unbelief but there's
[1:10:43] something else that we want to see in
[1:10:47] this and I take this from the message
[1:10:49] perfect faith brother brandom said at
[1:10:51] first the disciples did not have this
[1:10:53] perfect faith they didn't have it
[1:10:56] because they had Christ walking with
[1:10:59] them but then afterward Christ was in
[1:11:03] them and so he said it's hard then to
[1:11:06] have this perfect faith without the Holy
[1:11:09] Spirit it has to bring it it does and so
[1:11:12] let me just interject something there
[1:11:16] anyone with the Holy Ghost can have
[1:11:21] perfect
[1:11:22] Faith now I heard of a great theologian
[1:11:25] one time that that read the book perfect
[1:11:28] faith and he made the conclusion it was
[1:11:30] only for the prophet but I'm telling you
[1:11:33] this morning that anyone with the Holy
[1:11:36] Spirit can have perfect
[1:11:40] Faith now you as as I finished the
[1:11:43] quotation he said you say the disciples
[1:11:46] didn't have perfect Faith No they had an
[1:11:48] epileptic child there they were trying
[1:11:49] to cast this devil out of and they
[1:11:51] couldn't do it the father seen Jesus com
[1:11:53] and said we brought my son to your
[1:11:54] disciples and they should could not cure
[1:11:57] him you know I I think it's a crime I
[1:11:59] think it's a shame when when men and
[1:12:02] women sit in our church Bound by
[1:12:06] demons some of them as lost as lost can
[1:12:09] be and yet no hope
[1:12:12] giving no opportunity for real
[1:12:15] deliverance and salvation as I said that
[1:12:18] over and again one of the most principal
[1:12:21] things of the church should be to cast
[1:12:24] out devils
[1:12:26] you know Healing The Sick is casting out
[1:12:29] Devils amen it's delivering it's dealing
[1:12:32] with the spirit notice notice and and
[1:12:34] the disciples asked Jesus why couldn't
[1:12:36] we hear him and he said because of the
[1:12:39] lack of your faith of your unbelief now
[1:12:42] he said remember they had the power
[1:12:44] we're going to talk about this morning
[1:12:46] because we have the
[1:12:49] power and they had the power Jesus had
[1:12:53] given them the power well you can't get
[1:12:55] a higher authority than that amen if a
[1:12:59] if a prophet put his manle on you that's
[1:13:01] pretty good but
[1:13:03] Jesus had given them this
[1:13:06] Authority and he had given them power to
[1:13:09] heal the sick raise the Dead cast out
[1:13:11] Devils just few days before that they
[1:13:13] had the power but not the faith to use
[1:13:15] the power and brother brandham said now
[1:13:17] there's the brandham Tabernacle there's
[1:13:19] the church the bride today the holy
[1:13:22] spirit is here with the power but you
[1:13:25] haven't got that Faith to move it see
[1:13:27] what I mean it takes Faith to move
[1:13:29] it now
[1:13:33] Denny I shared this quote with you as I
[1:13:36] continue reading it a couple of weeks
[1:13:37] ago but bring it for your remember he he
[1:13:40] gives an example of the Dy Dynamo and he
[1:13:43] says here I've got a shell in my pocket
[1:13:46] and I hand loaded it I
[1:13:50] know what it'll do by the ballistics
[1:13:53] like the word but I got to fire the gun
[1:13:57] the fire has to get to the powder the
[1:13:58] powder's got to get got the power but it
[1:14:01] has to have the fire to light it off and
[1:14:03] the same thing the powders in the Shell
[1:14:06] but it needs the faith to charge it and
[1:14:09] throw it out and that's what it takes
[1:14:11] his perfect Faith to ignite the power of
[1:14:13] the Holy Spirit which we now have which
[1:14:17] we have now since he's come upon us
[1:14:19] Faith to ignite to see great
[1:14:23] things so now we need Faith to ignite
[1:14:27] the power in the word now let me just
[1:14:31] say because sometimes we get criticized
[1:14:34] because we get happy and we
[1:14:37] shout
[1:14:39] amen well even even in heaven when the
[1:14:43] book was open the lamb took the book
[1:14:46] everything in heaven
[1:14:47] rejoiced so if we know the book is open
[1:14:50] it ought to make us
[1:14:52] rejoice but I I just want to say hey you
[1:14:55] know it's not just screaming and
[1:14:57] shouting you know I imagine that the
[1:15:00] disciples screamed and jumped and
[1:15:03] shouted and there's nothing wrong with
[1:15:05] that there is a place for that in our
[1:15:09] worship amen there but it that never
[1:15:13] moved the devil you you don't shout to
[1:15:17] get the power but if you have the power
[1:15:20] it'll make you
[1:15:22] shout sometimes we get criticized for
[1:15:24] blowing things out of the whistle but at
[1:15:26] least there's a fire enough to blow it
[1:15:27] out the
[1:15:29] whistle amen and there was a Baptist man
[1:15:32] who came to brother brandom and he was
[1:15:34] Desiring God he said I've got all of
[1:15:36] these these um diplomas that are and
[1:15:40] certificates that's on my wall where you
[1:15:43] know I've been seeking for God and each
[1:15:45] one of them accomplishment and receiving
[1:15:48] a a diploma for and he says I'm still
[1:15:51] missing God in my life and he says so
[1:15:55] brother brandom said I understand you've
[1:15:58] turned Pentecostal I'm a Baptist and
[1:16:00] you've turned Pentecostal he said no I
[1:16:02] just received the Pentecostal blessing
[1:16:05] I'm not the Pentecostal denomination the
[1:16:07] Pentecostal blessing you said well I've
[1:16:09] been to their meetings and they kick
[1:16:12] over the chairs and throw a book through
[1:16:13] the window said you wouldn't call that
[1:16:17] behavior the Blessed Holy Spirit brother
[1:16:20] Brandon said I I I'm still not able to
[1:16:22] judge God he said well what makes him do
[1:16:25] that and then he brings this principle
[1:16:28] that I have been bringing up and I want
[1:16:30] to bring it again this morning and he
[1:16:33] says in my travel I find two classes of
[1:16:36] people one are fundamentals positionally
[1:16:40] they know by the mechanics that they are
[1:16:42] to be sons of God and Daughters of God
[1:16:45] and the next I find the Pentecostals
[1:16:46] with the baptism of the Holy Spirit and
[1:16:49] the fundamentals positionally know where
[1:16:52] they're at and they don't have any faith
[1:16:55] the word and the Pentecostal has got a
[1:16:56] lot of faith but don't know who they are
[1:16:58] it's like a man had money in the bank
[1:17:00] couldn't write a check one could write a
[1:17:02] check and had no money in the bank if if
[1:17:04] you could just get the two together and
[1:17:08] I said so it's letting off steam said I
[1:17:11] I don't think that would have to be
[1:17:13] necessary but they got to give vent
[1:17:15] somewhere and he said now if they would
[1:17:18] just take that Steam and know how to
[1:17:20] direct it fundamentally in the word the
[1:17:23] big regime of God would start moving on
[1:17:26] and then he says that's where Satan got
[1:17:28] in to make it all mechanics and no
[1:17:32] Dynamics our back all Dynamics and no
[1:17:36] mechanics we've got to put it
[1:17:39] together we've got the power of the Holy
[1:17:42] Spirit but we got to come back with the
[1:17:44] word to feed this machine we can't feed
[1:17:46] it on Creed it won't burn it it won't
[1:17:49] burn it it chokes up man cannot live by
[1:17:52] bread alone because it was made for the
[1:17:54] word of God but but every word of God
[1:17:56] out of the mouth of God so here we stand
[1:17:58] a church Commission on the last
[1:18:01] commission now he's actually in this
[1:18:03] sermon he's speaking about Samson and
[1:18:05] and how he was defeated before the enemy
[1:18:08] much much like much like this the
[1:18:11] disciples were defeated before the crowd
[1:18:14] and they couldn't cast The Devil out
[1:18:16] here again Samson is blinded and
[1:18:19] defeated and and he said Here We Stand a
[1:18:22] church commissioned on the last
[1:18:24] Commission the last thing Jesus said to
[1:18:26] his church the the the last of all
[1:18:29] Nations he that go into all the world
[1:18:32] and make the disciples to All Nations
[1:18:35] and he that believeth is baptized shall
[1:18:37] be saved he that believeth not shall be
[1:18:39] damned and and is a conjunction tie your
[1:18:41] sence together these signs shall follow
[1:18:43] them that believe in my name they shall
[1:18:46] cast out Devils they shall speak with
[1:18:48] new tongues if they take serpents up and
[1:18:51] things that not harm them if they lay
[1:18:52] hands on the sick they shall recover so
[1:18:55] he said so why would we have to stand in
[1:18:59] the presence of some Heathen God and
[1:19:02] take
[1:19:03] defeat and I just want to say why would
[1:19:06] we today have to just go to some
[1:19:10] psychology to try to fix the
[1:19:13] problem amen when the real problem is a
[1:19:16] problem within the soul we cast Satan
[1:19:20] out he's no longer the King sitting on
[1:19:23] that throne amen so psychology will not
[1:19:27] do that why why are we trying other
[1:19:29] things we know what the remedy is the
[1:19:33] remedy is coming to cover with God
[1:19:36] realize the power is here and say just
[1:19:38] once more Lord like Samson did I believe
[1:19:42] there's a new crop on Earth that's going
[1:19:44] to do that but anyway like Samson and
[1:19:48] his hair grown out and a returned to the
[1:19:51] Covenant the power with faith
[1:19:55] must return there has to be those two
[1:19:58] coming together someone who can write
[1:20:01] the check who's got money in the
[1:20:06] bank now brother bradam said in it is
[1:20:10] rizon of the sun he said now there's
[1:20:13] been churches churches Brides brides
[1:20:16] churches Brides brides but there's got
[1:20:19] to come one Hallelujah there's got to
[1:20:21] come a real bride there must come one
[1:20:24] that's not not only got the mechanics
[1:20:26] but the Dynamics of it it makes a church
[1:20:29] live and move on in the power of his
[1:20:32] resurrection and until we come to that
[1:20:34] place what good does it do to polish the
[1:20:37] hubs now what he's talking about there
[1:20:40] he's a give an example of two cars that
[1:20:43] are going to be going down the you know
[1:20:45] they're going to try to take a trip with
[1:20:47] and both of them have just come off the
[1:20:49] line and they're both filled up with
[1:20:51] with um high octane gas and they're fuel
[1:20:54] fueled up and they're ready to go but
[1:20:56] one of them's got Dynamics one of them's
[1:20:58] got spark and the other
[1:21:01] doesn't and you know that's the deal is
[1:21:03] that it's it's a it looks like a car it
[1:21:06] is a car but there's something wrong the
[1:21:09] me the mechanics is all there the word
[1:21:13] that has
[1:21:14] power amen gasoline has all the energy
[1:21:17] stored up in it but it needs the
[1:21:21] fire and I'm telling you I believe in
[1:21:24] this today we have the full word
[1:21:26] restored the full word has come back in
[1:21:29] this last day I believe we're are church
[1:21:33] that is full of high octane power the
[1:21:36] power is there but we need
[1:21:39] spark there has to be sparked with it
[1:21:42] come on not just a cranking on a battery
[1:21:45] and chug chug chug chug CH but I'm
[1:21:48] talking about a fire in the engine
[1:21:51] that'll shove that Cadillac down the
[1:21:53] road that are drive on down to Divine
[1:21:56] Healing that a drive on down to Miracles
[1:21:58] let a drive on to a
[1:22:01] rapture we need a resurrection in this
[1:22:04] hour so what good is it just to polish
[1:22:07] the
[1:22:09] church if it won't go on
[1:22:12] somewhere what good is it just going
[1:22:15] through the form of religion and no
[1:22:19] power and that's what the Bible said a
[1:22:22] form of godliness but deny the power
[1:22:27] thereof you know that we know Jesus he
[1:22:30] was the
[1:22:31] word but he had D Dynamics to go with
[1:22:34] the
[1:22:35] word now that's the way you can tell the
[1:22:38] true word if we really got the word amen
[1:22:41] the spirit comes with
[1:22:43] it amen there there again this is what
[1:22:47] you have to look well we got the word
[1:22:48] brother okay where is the spirit the
[1:22:52] spirit has to come to the word and with
[1:22:55] that ignite it when if it's true word
[1:22:57] it's spirit and
[1:23:00] Truth now so there again as we're
[1:23:03] looking at this we know God will have a
[1:23:06] bride in this last day and she's going
[1:23:08] to be F the fulfilling of all the
[1:23:10] manifestations and revelation of all of
[1:23:13] the things that is spoke of a bride in
[1:23:15] the Bible so it can only manifest that
[1:23:19] and and if we manifest something
[1:23:20] different from the groom it ain't the
[1:23:22] bride because the two are the one she is
[1:23:25] bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh
[1:23:27] and so brother brandom said until the
[1:23:29] church becomes both Dynamics and
[1:23:31] mechanics and the spirit of God that
[1:23:34] moved him to do the things he did if he
[1:23:36] hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride
[1:23:40] John 14:12 he that believeth on me the
[1:23:43] works that I do shall he do also I'll
[1:23:45] give him a charge of my Dynamics and his
[1:23:48] mechanics that the world will not be
[1:23:50] able to withstand it I'll raise him up
[1:23:52] again at the last day amen that's the
[1:23:55] Easter message the Dynamics and the
[1:23:57] mechanics together the mechanics without
[1:23:59] Dynamics no good neither is Dynamics
[1:24:03] without the mechanics you can jump and
[1:24:05] scream jump up and scream and shout and
[1:24:08] jump up and down all you want to deny
[1:24:10] this word it won't do any good you're
[1:24:12] just cranking around on the Pistons got
[1:24:14] sparked air to to fire but no gasoline
[1:24:17] to fire by it only work as they come
[1:24:20] together so one will sit still and the
[1:24:23] other will go up I I don't know what you
[1:24:25] want but I want to be in the car that
[1:24:27] goes
[1:24:29] up amen I want I want to be in the
[1:24:32] church that fires off that can move on
[1:24:35] down to the promises of God Amen now you
[1:24:40] know perfect faith is simply Faith made
[1:24:47] perfect all right it's just simply Faith
[1:24:51] come to Perfection maturity now Jesus
[1:24:56] never questioned his
[1:24:58] faith could you imagine Jesus
[1:25:01] questioning whether he had Faith or
[1:25:03] not he didn't he didn't question oh do I
[1:25:06] have the faith the disciples don't but
[1:25:08] do I you know um he didn't question
[1:25:12] whether he had Faith to stop the winds
[1:25:14] or or steal the waves or have faith to
[1:25:17] to raise Lazarus up he never questioned
[1:25:20] his faith and we should never question
[1:25:27] ours because the Bible said we live by
[1:25:30] the faith of the Son of God and as Born
[1:25:34] Again Believers God has given every one
[1:25:36] of us a Measure of
[1:25:40] Faith so you already have
[1:25:43] faith
[1:25:45] amen if you have no faith you could
[1:25:48] never please
[1:25:50] God faith is natural
[1:25:54] it is natural to a born- again believer
[1:25:57] he is Born Into Faith he is born of
[1:26:02] Faith so faith is one of the attributes
[1:26:05] of being born
[1:26:09] again amen if you don't have faith you
[1:26:12] can't please God so you can't be a
[1:26:14] Christian faith doesn't come by long
[1:26:17] drawn our prayer meetings it don't come
[1:26:20] by long fast faith comes by hearing the
[1:26:25] word
[1:26:26] preached that's why the sinner starts
[1:26:29] believing that Jesus will save him is
[1:26:31] because he hears the word
[1:26:33] preached amen and he here's that word
[1:26:36] preached that God will save to the
[1:26:39] uttermost amen and that's why anointed
[1:26:42] preaching points out what is provided in
[1:26:45] the word and Faith just AB
[1:26:49] automatically grasp that and acts on it
[1:26:53] and of course if it does act on it it's
[1:26:56] dead right cuz faith without works is
[1:27:00] dead amen so you say well I've got faith
[1:27:04] well there has to be some Works to go
[1:27:06] with it and if it doesn't have it you've
[1:27:08] got dead
[1:27:10] Faith now like Jesus Adam never wondered
[1:27:14] or questioned his
[1:27:16] faith it was born into
[1:27:19] him faith is an attribute of a child of
[1:27:22] God
[1:27:24] a child of God is born of faith and born
[1:27:26] with faith and faith is an unconscious
[1:27:29] part of your makeup as a child of
[1:27:33] God Amen I'm operating right now on
[1:27:36] unconscious thing my heart is pumping
[1:27:38] away and pumping oxygen and whatever
[1:27:41] coming through my from my lungs into my
[1:27:43] blood and going through my veins and I'm
[1:27:46] unconscious of it even
[1:27:48] happening faith is an unconscious thing
[1:27:51] it's a part of your makeup
[1:27:55] as a child of God you are a
[1:27:58] Believer Believers believe that's what
[1:28:00] they
[1:28:01] do amen so you so you know you don't
[1:28:04] think of your faith you just think of
[1:28:07] God's ability and his provision in you
[1:28:09] through the new birth you think of his
[1:28:12] faithfulness to make his word good and
[1:28:15] and accomplish what was provided for us
[1:28:17] to his
[1:28:18] atonement too many times you know you
[1:28:21] know people think of do I have faith for
[1:28:24] this is my faith strong enough but you
[1:28:27] don't you are not and and I'm even
[1:28:29] quoting brother Brandon from this and
[1:28:31] and in his um when he sent out a prayer
[1:28:34] card or sorry um a prayer ribbon there
[1:28:38] that he prayed over a handkerchief had
[1:28:40] taken from the Bible where they took um
[1:28:43] clothing or parts of clothing from from
[1:28:45] Paul and from his body and and laid it
[1:28:48] on the sick and demons
[1:28:50] fled and so you know as he sent out
[1:28:53] these prayer CLA for free and he says he
[1:28:57] put a little letter in there he says you
[1:28:59] don't think of your faith or how much
[1:29:02] you do or don't have we are not to be
[1:29:06] occupied with our
[1:29:07] feelings our symptoms or our faith or
[1:29:12] our lack of faith but only with what God
[1:29:19] Said Amen come on you know you you you
[1:29:24] go to doing what like what what would
[1:29:27] happen if David you know walked out and
[1:29:29] he said am I up to
[1:29:33] this is my aim good enough have I
[1:29:36] practiced this
[1:29:38] enough yeah you know I mean can I hit
[1:29:41] that little bitty Target there it's got
[1:29:43] a helmet on a shield and all of it can I
[1:29:46] get the right
[1:29:48] spot you see David never questioned that
[1:29:52] amen his I was on his God here comes the
[1:29:57] enemy says I'm going to throw you to the
[1:30:00] birds amen and he curses his God and he
[1:30:03] said you come to me with a sword and a
[1:30:06] spear and you're training but I come to
[1:30:08] you in the name of the Lord
[1:30:12] God hallelujah you see he came
[1:30:15] representing the god of Israel and as a
[1:30:18] Seed of Abraham he was going to conquer
[1:30:20] the enemy's gate that giant was going to
[1:30:23] fall
[1:30:24] he didn't look to see am I able to do
[1:30:27] this he looked on how big his God was
[1:30:31] not how big the problem
[1:30:35] was this is often the problem we look
[1:30:39] and see how big the problem
[1:30:42] is how big the giant is in our life
[1:30:46] rather than keeping our eyes on how big
[1:30:49] our God
[1:30:52] is now
[1:30:54] we live by faith is an unconscious faith
[1:30:57] when God tells you something you're not
[1:30:59] to think of your faith or the lack of it
[1:31:01] you just think of God's ability and his
[1:31:04] provision now what Adam lost in the
[1:31:08] fall Is Ours by the lamb taken the
[1:31:13] book we live in a very special time yes
[1:31:17] we're way on the other side you know at
[1:31:20] the end of the ages and we're right here
[1:31:23] with a where Revelation has come to us
[1:31:27] where that the lamb is taken the book
[1:31:30] and released the Revelation making known
[1:31:33] the Mysteries and open up the book and
[1:31:36] and and who did it the lamb did it and
[1:31:40] who was the lamb the man Christ Jesus so
[1:31:43] when he took the book it was a man
[1:31:45] taking the book so for the first time
[1:31:49] since Adam when Adam fell it went back
[1:31:52] in the hands of almight
[1:31:54] God but now in our day come on Jesus the
[1:31:59] man took the book for
[1:32:02] man amen and he did not just come and
[1:32:06] leave it there in the heavens but he set
[1:32:08] it down ripped off the seals sent it
[1:32:12] down to the seventh angel on Earth to
[1:32:14] reveal the Mysteries and in Revelation
[1:32:17] 10 he shows his anointing come down
[1:32:20] Christ coming down with an open book and
[1:32:23] he tells you you now you the Unworthy
[1:32:26] one who couldn't even look at the book
[1:32:28] or couldn't even take the book now go
[1:32:31] take the book and consume that book and
[1:32:34] beat the
[1:32:35] [Applause]
[1:32:42] book we're living in a a wonderful
[1:32:49] hour where God's doing Mighty things
[1:32:57] am and you are the visible part of the
[1:33:00] Unseen
[1:33:06] realm now Adam of course lost the book
[1:33:11] when he sinned by heeding his wife's
[1:33:14] reasoning instead of holding on to God's
[1:33:16] word so they took reasoning instead of
[1:33:19] the word the disciples are having an
[1:33:22] issue
[1:33:24] they're hearing from the crowd's
[1:33:26] reasoning and they put they put aside
[1:33:29] the words of Jesus I give you power over
[1:33:32] unclean
[1:33:33] spirits they put that aside and listen
[1:33:35] to the reasoning of the
[1:33:38] crowd now Adam Sinn by heeding this
[1:33:42] reasoning his wife reason with Satan
[1:33:44] produced the product to Adam Adam turn
[1:33:46] loose of the word and sold out he lost
[1:33:49] his
[1:33:50] inheritance when he lost his fellowship
[1:33:53] and right to life remember the day you
[1:33:55] eat thereof that day you
[1:33:57] die and when he lost his life he lost
[1:34:01] his inheritance in life because he had
[1:34:05] Supreme control of the earth he was a
[1:34:08] god of the earth you
[1:34:11] know Eden was the extension of Heaven on
[1:34:15] Earth and his job was to take an earth
[1:34:20] that was without form and void and
[1:34:22] darkness cover it and and all kinds of
[1:34:25] of things up chaos upon the Earth and
[1:34:27] turned the whole earth into an
[1:34:32] Eden and so you know his son had this
[1:34:35] Earth under his control he could speak
[1:34:38] he could name remember even when the
[1:34:42] animals were named God brought the
[1:34:44] animals to Adam and to see what he would
[1:34:46] name them why didn't God just name
[1:34:49] him cuz God had given him
[1:34:52] dominion and and it was his place now to
[1:34:55] name every animal he could speak he
[1:34:57] could name he could he could stop
[1:35:01] nature but when sin came he lost his
[1:35:05] inheritance you see Adam could say let
[1:35:08] this mountain be moved over there and
[1:35:11] Adam could do it it would it would obey
[1:35:13] him let this tree be plucked up planted
[1:35:16] over there it would happen he had
[1:35:19] complete Supreme Court control as a
[1:35:22] minor God under God our father because
[1:35:25] he was a Son of
[1:35:28] God now when the last name is put on the
[1:35:32] book and the battle is all finished
[1:35:35] here we will come back to an
[1:35:38] earth that has been burn over and sin
[1:35:42] cleansed from it and we'll walk out on
[1:35:45] the ashes of the wicked and we with the
[1:35:49] man Christ Jesus he's God I'm not trying
[1:35:52] to take away his God godship but but
[1:35:55] with the man Christ Jesus I'm just
[1:35:56] showing you he became one of us so we
[1:35:59] could become one with him with Christ
[1:36:02] and his bride we'll restore the Earth
[1:36:05] back to an Eden
[1:36:07] again so you see right now Satan is
[1:36:12] still the prince of the power of the air
[1:36:15] and that's why there is always a
[1:36:18] conflict when we as the citizens of that
[1:36:21] Heavenly Kingdom begin to disturb his
[1:36:25] realm that's right because because by
[1:36:29] permission because of the Fall Satan has
[1:36:32] the right to inhabit
[1:36:34] people
[1:36:37] until until the
[1:36:39] moment they side with the word of God
[1:36:41] and said I don't want to live under that
[1:36:43] any
[1:36:48] longer and then Satan's Reign ends with
[1:36:52] their soul
[1:36:56] now
[1:36:58] notice Adam had Supreme control he was a
[1:37:02] minor God on the earth he was he was God
[1:37:06] upon the earth a minor God a little God
[1:37:10] he said ah brother Tim okay let's go
[1:37:12] back
[1:37:15] again cats give birth to
[1:37:19] cats dogs give birth to dogs
[1:37:23] humans give birth to humans so when
[1:37:28] you're born
[1:37:29] again and God gives
[1:37:33] birth it's not going to be a duck or a
[1:37:36] frog it's going to be another
[1:37:39] God yes sir you were predestined to be
[1:37:43] in the image of his son Jesus Christ to
[1:37:47] be just like him
[1:37:54] so now here's the question comes back
[1:37:56] around you know that there was Adam
[1:37:59] before the fall but if the blood has
[1:38:02] cleansed it back do you believe in the
[1:38:04] power of the blood we sing about it do
[1:38:07] you believe it well then the power of
[1:38:09] the blood cleanses it back look what
[1:38:13] look what happened when God took Earth
[1:38:16] that was
[1:38:17] cursed what are you talking about
[1:38:19] brother Tim I'm talking about the body
[1:38:22] of Jesus made out a cursed
[1:38:28] Earth he
[1:38:30] came the Holy Spirit overshadowed the
[1:38:33] Virgin and wrapped around him Earth that
[1:38:37] was
[1:38:39] cursed and Jesus took that cursed Earth
[1:38:42] down to the water and baptized
[1:38:45] it and there was filled with the Holy
[1:38:48] Ghost and made curse Earth I'm talking
[1:38:51] about Earth that was under a curse amen
[1:38:54] made it are you with me made it obey God
[1:38:59] so if he did that with Jesus what do you
[1:39:02] think he's going to do with
[1:39:05] you come on when he comes down into your
[1:39:08] life he'll take your cursed Earth that
[1:39:11] used to blaspheme and speak evil and all
[1:39:14] kinds of things your mouth speaking
[1:39:16] wrong things your hands doing wrong
[1:39:17] thing your feet Swift shed blood all of
[1:39:21] these things listen let me tell you when
[1:39:22] he comes in your life he'll take that
[1:39:26] curse Earth and make them hands lift up
[1:39:30] and glorify God make your lips give
[1:39:32] praise to
[1:39:39] him and Jesus took that Earth to the
[1:39:42] grave and raised it up
[1:39:45] glorified and it's no longer under the
[1:39:47] curse and one day this cursed Earth will
[1:39:51] no longer be under the cursed we're
[1:39:53] going to be changed in a moment in a
[1:39:55] twinkling of an
[1:39:58] eye and be
[1:40:01] glorified cuz flesh and blood cannot
[1:40:03] inherit the
[1:40:05] Kingdom so
[1:40:07] then what about it now Jesus controlled
[1:40:11] storms he rebuked winds and waves he
[1:40:15] removed life from a fig tree he healed
[1:40:18] the sick cast out Devils he rebuked
[1:40:21] death and a man 4 days dead lived
[1:40:25] again and then he said the works that I
[1:40:30] do shall you do
[1:40:33] also now Adam lost his inheritance to
[1:40:36] the Earth it passed from his hands back
[1:40:39] to God again Satan's dirty hands
[1:40:41] couldn't take it let me tell you Satan's
[1:40:43] only a
[1:40:45] squatter he is only there by permission
[1:40:48] what permission man's permission man
[1:40:51] sold out to Satan bought his reasoning
[1:40:54] took his lies and come the way of
[1:40:57] Mortals and because of that we all die
[1:41:00] yes
[1:41:02] sir and Adam sold his sold his faith in
[1:41:06] God to Satan's
[1:41:07] reasoning and his eternal life and his
[1:41:10] right to the tree of life and the right
[1:41:12] to the Earth that belonged to him he
[1:41:14] forfeits it all the way all the way back
[1:41:16] to Satan I mean forfeit forfeits the
[1:41:19] rights to it to the hands of Satan and
[1:41:22] and but the the title deed goes back in
[1:41:24] the hand of almighty God that's why
[1:41:27] Revelation five shows one sitting on the
[1:41:31] throne it ain't the devil he don't hold
[1:41:35] the title
[1:41:37] deed but it became a question document
[1:41:40] because man owned
[1:41:42] it and now Satan says but he sold it to
[1:41:46] me and so there comes a question on it
[1:41:49] so it is in the hands of almighty God
[1:41:52] until a man can come who is worthy to
[1:41:56] redeem
[1:41:58] it Hallelujah and there are kinsman
[1:42:01] redeemer was worthy he had the
[1:42:04] wealth amen I said he had the wealth he
[1:42:08] could pay the debt you couldn't
[1:42:12] pay amen he had the he had his blood
[1:42:15] listen listen the blood of bulls and
[1:42:17] goats
[1:42:18] not a million of them could not
[1:42:22] represent or be enough to cover one
[1:42:29] child I've done it many many times you
[1:42:31] know I use an example you know I I used
[1:42:35] to raise registered priz Nubian goats
[1:42:39] had ribbons and and trophies also had
[1:42:42] Black Angus
[1:42:44] Cattle redard Prime
[1:42:48] stock bring a little child up and ask
[1:42:51] the parents
[1:42:54] how many how many of my goats would you
[1:42:56] trade for this kid this
[1:43:01] child how many would it
[1:43:04] take 100 no 200 no a th000
[1:43:09] no okay I got cattle I got priced cattle
[1:43:12] what about cattle I I'll you put them up
[1:43:15] how many a million two million you see
[1:43:18] you can stack them all up they wouldn't
[1:43:20] all of the animals in the world would
[1:43:23] not be the worth of one human
[1:43:27] being but then God took on Flesh and
[1:43:31] Blood amen and it wasn't an unworthy
[1:43:34] human dying for another another unworthy
[1:43:37] human that unworthy one would have to
[1:43:39] die for his own sin but here comes a
[1:43:41] sinless one and his blood is enough to
[1:43:45] cover the sin of the world
[1:43:53] blood of that one
[1:43:54] [Applause]
[1:44:01] man but the Earth right now is under the
[1:44:05] prince of the power of the
[1:44:07] air but God
[1:44:09] promises to bring man back on the throne
[1:44:15] again if you read Revelation chapter 3
[1:44:19] in the leoan age which is the last age
[1:44:23] you will find the last age will sit with
[1:44:26] him on his
[1:44:30] throne but until until that until that
[1:44:35] the the Earth there uh you know is and
[1:44:40] and the battle here is
[1:44:42] finished we have to fight for our
[1:44:44] position as
[1:44:48] sons and remember we're going to hear
[1:44:50] from the crowd too that's right and and
[1:44:55] because of our first birth we were born
[1:44:58] defeated and under Satan's
[1:45:02] Dominion but I want to get it back to
[1:45:05] you again in our day the Lost
[1:45:07] inheritance has come back to a man
[1:45:10] again and in heaven the man Christ Jesus
[1:45:13] Took the
[1:45:15] book and now the for the forfeited title
[1:45:19] deed is back in the hands of the
[1:45:21] original owner
[1:45:23] amen that's why friends he's about to
[1:45:26] call for his
[1:45:28] bride amen he's about to wind up and
[1:45:31] finish Redemption he's already taken the
[1:45:34] steps to do it he paid for it at Calvary
[1:45:39] amen he's doing his claiming work right
[1:45:42] now when he gets the last one whose name
[1:45:45] is on the book claimed and dipped in
[1:45:48] blood he'll take that book that people
[1:45:52] to heaven
[1:45:53] there'll be change in a moment in a
[1:45:55] twinkling of an
[1:45:57] [Applause]
[1:45:59] eye
[1:46:01] Hallelujah the title
[1:46:06] deed it went back in the hands of
[1:46:08] almighty God but God had given that to
[1:46:12] Adam Adam lost it now it's being
[1:46:15] restored by the second
[1:46:18] item seals torn off handed to the
[1:46:21] seventh angel on Earth
[1:46:23] which opens the book of inheritance to
[1:46:26] us and that makes the accuser so
[1:46:33] angry it's because we who in our first
[1:46:37] birth was born to sin and were
[1:46:40] slaves we are now free
[1:46:46] born and that's a great battle every
[1:46:49] time we try to take position and use our
[1:46:51] faith is that there is a battle of
[1:46:54] wisdom or reasoning versus faith and the
[1:46:58] crowd screams at us with all of man's
[1:47:00] Wisdom to try to keep you from Dominion
[1:47:04] because they're anointed of the devil to
[1:47:05] do so and while on the other hand the
[1:47:09] word of faith it is screaming from every
[1:47:14] scripture are you with me amen it
[1:47:17] screams from every from a whole cloud of
[1:47:21] witnesses amen and and it is saying
[1:47:24] you've got
[1:47:27] Dominion come on somebody Abraham would
[1:47:30] say as a father of Faith he said if I
[1:47:33] believe God and I was under only under
[1:47:36] blood of bulls and goats how about you
[1:47:38] under the blood of Jesus Christ the true
[1:47:41] Lamb of God how much more should you
[1:47:43] [Applause]
[1:47:50] believe and it's screaming you can do it
[1:47:54] amen I walk with God says Enoch you can
[1:47:57] walk with God in an evil Day come on in
[1:48:01] the days like in there was in the days
[1:48:03] of Noah precursor to Noah's day when the
[1:48:06] the Mind man was on evil
[1:48:10] continually we're back here
[1:48:13] again we're back here again the days of
[1:48:16] Sodom gomor the days of Noah as it was
[1:48:19] in the days of lot we're back here you
[1:48:22] see because they were only foreshadowing
[1:48:24] in what would be here in the end time
[1:48:26] and so here we are in the last
[1:48:31] day but they're screaming out as a
[1:48:34] witness see this is what Paul said in
[1:48:37] the book of Hebrews chapter 11 he goes
[1:48:40] all through and he says by faith Moses
[1:48:42] by fa now
[1:48:44] listen
[1:48:45] listen it wasn't yet born into them
[1:48:49] yet they wasn't even born of faith
[1:48:53] somebody help me preach there was no new
[1:48:56] birth under the Old Testament it's only
[1:48:59] in the New Testament that there's a new
[1:49:00] birth the blood of bulls and goats could
[1:49:03] not remit sin the nature of an innocent
[1:49:06] lamb could not come back on the believer
[1:49:09] he would go and worship offer his lamb
[1:49:11] go back the same sinner that he was but
[1:49:13] not this
[1:49:15] Blood amen once this blood comes upon
[1:49:18] you the very nature of the Lamb comes on
[1:49:21] the inside of you
[1:49:23] you Hallelujah you have his life you
[1:49:27] have his nature on the inside of you
[1:49:29] you're a son you're a daughter of God
[1:49:34] redeemed Hallelujah redeemed how I love
[1:49:37] to Proclaim it Redeemed by the blood of
[1:49:40] the Lamb redeemed through his infinite
[1:49:42] Mercy his child and
[1:49:46] forever I am because there's nothing can
[1:49:49] separate me from the love of God
[1:50:01] Hallelujah he cannot deny himself so he
[1:50:05] cannot deny me as his
[1:50:07] child every child born of him is
[1:50:10] recognized by
[1:50:15] him the great
[1:50:17] battle every time we try to take
[1:50:20] position and use our faith
[1:50:23] there's this battle and it screams out
[1:50:25] at
[1:50:27] us and your success of the war depends
[1:50:31] on who and what you
[1:50:34] believe will you believe the crowd like
[1:50:37] the disciples did or will you believe
[1:50:40] the words of
[1:50:42] Jesus they say you can't he says you
[1:50:50] can he named it Pig trees s siine trees
[1:50:57] mountains whatever you say come
[1:51:00] on Amen they say you can't he says you
[1:51:06] can listen somebody's going to have to
[1:51:09] believe in the impossible in this
[1:51:13] day right I mean because that's what
[1:51:16] that's what the chain of your body is
[1:51:17] standing on your feet change in a moment
[1:51:20] the twinkling of an eye
[1:51:23] amen that's a massive Divine Healing
[1:51:25] from the top of your head to the sole of
[1:51:27] your feet that's gray hair coming back

[1:51:36] artificial in the
[1:51:37] socket coming back the
[1:51:40] right thing

[1:51:51] doctor the other day in the hospital and
[1:51:53] I got a new kneecap well you can't take
[1:51:55] it to
[1:52:01] Heaven
[1:52:04] Hallelujah now notice then he gives us
[1:52:07] an abstract title
[1:52:09] deed and that abstract means it search
[1:52:12] all the way back to the beginning it's
[1:52:15] like putting a little drop of in down
[1:52:17] into bleach and it just dissipates
[1:52:20] disappears you see when sin has been
[1:52:23] confessed and fallen into the blood of
[1:52:26] Jesus Christ it gives an abstract right
[1:52:29] straight back to the Creator and you
[1:52:31] become a Son of
[1:52:33] God its Redemption means all legal
[1:52:37] possession I I want you to get this its
[1:52:40] Redemption means all legal possession to
[1:52:44] all that was lost by Adam and
[1:52:47] Eve what ought it do to a born again
[1:52:50] Christian today you talk about something
[1:52:52] that out
[1:52:53] over I'm talking about the lamb a man
[1:52:56] taking the book The Christ Jesus taking
[1:52:58] the book and loosens it its seals and
[1:53:01] opening the promises back to you again
[1:53:05] taking off the Creeds and the dogmas
[1:53:07] that held it
[1:53:09] back are you with me it's Redemption
[1:53:12] means that all that was lost by Adam and
[1:53:16] Eve amen has been given
[1:53:19] back to you as a child of God
[1:53:23] amen it's it's legal possession the
[1:53:26] abstract title deed of eternal life
[1:53:28] means that you possess everything that
[1:53:32] Adam and Eve
[1:53:35] lost
[1:53:36] amen and that's what you when you get
[1:53:39] the Holy Ghost you get an abstract title
[1:53:43] deed that all the leans against you what
[1:53:46] your mother did your daddy did I don't
[1:53:48] care what kind of sins there was and
[1:53:50] what they did and what and what was in
[1:53:52] your family and your family
[1:53:53] tree I don't care what you did and the
[1:53:56] life you lived and how bad you lived and
[1:53:58] all of that it's all wiped
[1:54:01] away every debt of it is paid amen God
[1:54:05] gives you an abstract title deed that
[1:54:08] means he searched your title and he
[1:54:11] cleared the the leans that were against
[1:54:13] you that said you couldn't be free that
[1:54:16] you couldn't go to heaven that you had
[1:54:18] to go to hell that you were possessed by
[1:54:20] the devil let me tell you when Jesus
[1:54:23] blood came upon you it gave you an
[1:54:25] abstract title deed and cleared your
[1:54:29] deed and it cannot be
[1:54:32] [Applause]
[1:54:44] found you know every
[1:54:47] man was made to potentially become a son
[1:54:51] of God
[1:54:55] no matter how sinful he is or how far
[1:54:57] away he
[1:54:58] is he's a fallen
[1:55:01] son God's his creator his
[1:55:05] maker Jesus Paid the the
[1:55:09] price he may not ever reconcile himself
[1:55:12] to that may never accept it may may
[1:55:15] never do him any good but yet
[1:55:17] potentially he has the potential to
[1:55:20] become to become r revealed as a
[1:55:24] son now what did God put man here
[1:55:28] for he made him to have dominion you
[1:55:32] would read Genesis 1 Genesis 2 you would
[1:55:35] find he gave him dominion over the fish
[1:55:38] the seed the foul of the air now think
[1:55:41] about it for a
[1:55:43] moment after the curse after the fall he
[1:55:46] would have to do things by the sweat of
[1:55:48] the
[1:55:50] brow so before the fall he did things
[1:55:53] just like Jesus the second Adam
[1:55:56] did he said to the Fig Tree he spoke to
[1:56:00] the winds and
[1:56:01] waves he controlled nature he controlled
[1:56:04] the Earth he brought God's peace upon
[1:56:06] the
[1:56:08] Earth the lion would lay down by the
[1:56:12] lamb you
[1:56:13] see so he was made to have
[1:56:17] dominion well brother Tim that's great
[1:56:20] one day we're going to have it we'll be
[1:56:23] there well let me tell you let me tell
[1:56:26] you a little in on Little Secret when
[1:56:29] you're born again as a son or daughter
[1:56:31] of God you were made to have dominion
[1:56:37] too in fact of the matter is well
[1:56:40] brother Tim we we we got to sin every
[1:56:42] day uh sin shall not have dominion over
[1:56:50] you well we can't
[1:56:53] live sin has no more rule over
[1:56:58] you there is therefore now no
[1:57:02] condemnation to them who are in Christ
[1:57:05] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:57:07] after the spirit for the law of spirit
[1:57:11] and life have made you free from the law
[1:57:13] of sin and
[1:57:16] death so he made Adam to have dominion
[1:57:20] but even with the Great Commission in
[1:57:22] the New Testament it's the same Jesus
[1:57:25] gave you
[1:57:26] Dominion I give you
[1:57:29] Dominion in fact of the matter is you'll
[1:57:32] do this in my name or you will be here
[1:57:35] in my stead taking my
[1:57:38] place I'm going to go away I've got work
[1:57:42] to do there I'm leaving you
[1:57:44] here in charge of a
[1:57:47] work and you're going to do this in my
[1:57:50] stad in my
[1:57:54] name come
[1:57:55] on Amen so now you know if I send you
[1:57:59] with a message what would you say
[1:58:01] brother Tim said I have sent you in my
[1:58:04] name so you use my name for the
[1:58:07] authority that's why we pray in the name
[1:58:09] of Jesus we are using his name as the
[1:58:12] authority he gave me this
[1:58:16] Authority amen my authority comes
[1:58:19] because I've been born again and I have
[1:58:22] dominion so you will be here in my stad
[1:58:25] acting in my name and you will cast out
[1:58:30] Devils you will lay hands on the sick
[1:58:32] and they shall
[1:58:34] recover you will speak Heaven's
[1:58:37] Language new
[1:58:43] tongues you know there's a lot of things
[1:58:45] needs to be fixed in your life one of
[1:58:47] them is your
[1:58:49] tongue will you speak the language of
[1:58:52] Heaven you say what heaven says about
[1:58:55] things now God when he made man in the
[1:58:58] beginning he made him Superior to
[1:59:00] everything on the earth he gave him
[1:59:02] jurisdictions on on the earth to control
[1:59:05] uh animal life the fowl the fish the sea
[1:59:08] controlled the winds controll plant life
[1:59:10] he controlled
[1:59:12] everything Adam could speak to the winds
[1:59:14] it would stop could speak to the trees
[1:59:17] they would obey him speak to Wildlife
[1:59:20] they would obey him speak to the waters
[1:59:23] whatever it was everything obeyed Adam
[1:59:26] that's the beginning of man that's what
[1:59:29] God gave him power of was everything on
[1:59:31] the earth man was made as we said like a
[1:59:35] secondary God he was given power to
[1:59:38] control all things all elements and to
[1:59:40] the fall he lost that power and after
[1:59:44] losing his relationship and his
[1:59:46] friendship with the father then he
[1:59:48] becomes unconscious of the fact that he
[1:59:51] is is to have
[1:59:54] dominion and all of his channels then
[1:59:57] became clogged up and he he just
[1:59:59] couldn't come get through there was like
[2:00:02] a Dark Mist between the earth as Satan
[2:00:04] becomes the prince of the power of the
[2:00:07] air and so there again you know man lost
[2:00:13] he lost his contact with God and he lost
[2:00:17] his ability to have
[2:00:19] dominion but now what Adam was in God
[2:00:22] Christ redeemed back for
[2:00:25] us amen he broke the veil between that
[2:00:29] that held out the the held back the
[2:00:31] blessings of God between us and God Amen
[2:00:34] let me tell you there's nothing between
[2:00:38] you and your
[2:00:40] savior nothing between you and God once
[2:00:43] you're born again you have a direct line
[2:00:46] to the throne of
[2:00:50] grace you have the like to go there
[2:00:53] anytime to find help or assistance in
[2:00:57] your time of
[2:01:00] need but you know Adam had never had to
[2:01:02] be sick he never had to die he never had
[2:01:04] to worry he never had a
[2:01:06] heartache he didn't know
[2:01:10] fear he just climbing the arms of his
[2:01:14] father whatever he ask he got everything
[2:01:18] obeyed
[2:01:19] him he was God's child he was as a child
[2:01:22] he's the heir of all
[2:01:24] things but when man fell he lost his
[2:01:30] Dominion but then Jesus
[2:01:32] comes through that
[2:01:35] Darkness God comes down when we couldn't
[2:01:37] go into the Earth God came when we
[2:01:40] couldn't go into heaven God came to
[2:01:43] Earth and so God comes to bring us back
[2:01:47] to the Eternal Fellowship relationship
[2:01:50] to be his sons and daughter
[2:01:53] again and and I want you to know that we
[2:01:57] were originally wired for
[2:02:01] Faith however when face wire is broken
[2:02:04] or blocked with a some type of insulator
[2:02:07] the power to move life's mountains
[2:02:09] cannot flow and that breaking the wire
[2:02:12] our channel is always
[2:02:16] doubt unbelief unbelief is sin then
[2:02:19] there are attributes of sin that comes
[2:02:21] out from that of of of every kind of
[2:02:25] demonic influence smoking drinking lying
[2:02:27] cussing everything
[2:02:30] else but the thing of it
[2:02:32] is many times that
[2:02:35] we because of the crowd we're we're born
[2:02:39] into and surround us we many times you
[2:02:43] know we we know what we were in the past
[2:02:46] and how that we lived and and and we we
[2:02:51] the the devil always wants to Heap upon
[2:02:54] you some kind of condemnation and we
[2:02:56] lose conscience of what God really put
[2:03:00] you here
[2:03:01] for he didn't put you here to be
[2:03:04] defeated or live defeated lives he lived
[2:03:08] you to walk for he left you here to walk
[2:03:10] in Victory in fact to the matter even
[2:03:13] before the disciples were born
[2:03:16] again you see just on the authority of
[2:03:20] his word
[2:03:22] they healed the sick and Devils were
[2:03:24] made subject to
[2:03:25] him is that right amen and when he sent
[2:03:29] out is the 70 and by the way they would
[2:03:32] later walk off and never even follow him
[2:03:35] that's right they would they would
[2:03:37] actually become some of those said Lord
[2:03:39] Lord have we not cast out devils in your
[2:03:41] name have we not have we not done many
[2:03:43] mighty works and he says depart from me
[2:03:45] I never knew
[2:03:49] you you're not part of my destiny
[2:03:52] you're not part of my gender not part of
[2:03:55] my
[2:03:56] life I didn't you're not
[2:03:59] mine you're the devil's children what
[2:04:04] you see this is where the Bible said in
[2:04:05] the last day there would be anointed
[2:04:07] ones of the end time who would be truly
[2:04:11] anointed but false
[2:04:15] seed and these would deceive the elect
[2:04:18] if it were possible the even the elect
[2:04:20] would be deceived by it if it was
[2:04:24] possible so now Jesus sends his
[2:04:27] disciples out just on the authority of
[2:04:29] his word and just on the authority of
[2:04:32] his word they healed the sick and Devils
[2:04:35] were made subject to them I'm I'm just I
[2:04:38] I'm going to lay this out for a moment
[2:04:41] because just on the authority of the
[2:04:49] Bible they went out just on the
[2:04:51] authority of the words of
[2:04:54] Jesus and cast Devils out that's right
[2:04:58] and Luke 8 10:18 said he saw he saw them
[2:05:02] and said I beheld Satan as lightning
[2:05:06] fall from Heaven what's he saying I saw
[2:05:09] Satan's Rule and Dominion
[2:05:13] broken cuz they had come back and they
[2:05:15] were rejoicing said Lord we cast out
[2:05:19] devils in your name
[2:05:23] amen and they were rejoicing and he said
[2:05:26] and Jesus even rejoiced and he says hey
[2:05:30] I saw it myself I was looking in the
[2:05:34] spirit I you know maybe I didn't see
[2:05:37] them it wasn't physically there when you
[2:05:39] laid hands on that one or you cast out
[2:05:41] that devil but I was there and I saw in
[2:05:45] the
[2:05:47] spirit you disturb Satan's Dominion
[2:05:52] like lightning he fell from heaven and
[2:05:54] his Dominion was broken over those
[2:05:57] people and then he further he says in in
[2:06:00] Luke 9 10:19 behold I give you power to
[2:06:05] tread on serpents and scorpions and over
[2:06:08] all the power of the enemy and nothing
[2:06:11] shall by any means hurt
[2:06:15] you
[2:06:17] hallelujah amen now now listen that the
[2:06:21] disciples hadn't even been filled with
[2:06:22] the Holy Ghost yet that's the 70 was not
[2:06:25] even in the upper room they never went
[2:06:28] there but they were given power for the
[2:06:32] word I'm trying to show you the word
[2:06:34] itself will give
[2:06:38] power just taking what the word said and
[2:06:41] acting on it will give you power
[2:06:45] right this is why we have men and I hate
[2:06:49] to mention names but like a a Allen you
[2:06:51] know that
[2:06:52] was would die a
[2:06:53] drunk with alcohol in his blood you know
[2:06:58] a horrible end but yet cast out many
[2:07:03] Devils what on the authority of the
[2:07:08] word now if this was true based on the
[2:07:13] authority of Jesus word that these 70s
[2:07:16] went out and cast out
[2:07:18] devils and yet wasn't even born again
[2:07:21] how how much more true is it that we who
[2:07:24] have been redeemed and restored to
[2:07:27] sunship surely we can take those words
[2:07:30] of Jesus and force Satan's
[2:07:35] fall hallelujah amen listen if they did
[2:07:38] it just by looking in the word taking
[2:07:42] God at his word what about you as a
[2:07:45] Believer this morning a child of God
[2:07:48] filled with the Holy Ghost come on now
[2:07:51] what about you you ought to be
[2:07:53] disturbing Satan's Dominion pulling down
[2:07:56] his kingdom shreding down on
[2:08:00] servants hallelujah amen taking dominion
[2:08:04] over
[2:08:06] sickness over problems in your
[2:08:09] life you were created to be an overcomer
[2:08:13] you were not made to be
[2:08:20] defeated but through the fall now it was
[2:08:24] like as it was the channels of the
[2:08:26] plumbing or the wiring in our brains and
[2:08:28] the outlets that faith has been clogged
[2:08:30] up with business Affair and home life
[2:08:32] and domestic
[2:08:34] things it comes so and and all of these
[2:08:37] are from the
[2:08:39] crowd and become so clogged up until God
[2:08:43] I can operate to the channels that he
[2:08:45] made man
[2:08:46] far now when God made the human body
[2:08:49] ever part of it it all had a part to
[2:08:52] play the teeth the tongues the eyes the
[2:08:55] nose everything God does is in perfect
[2:08:59] and operation to make Man live and so
[2:09:01] God so designed the human body of man so
[2:09:06] don't you know he also designed and set
[2:09:09] in order the body of Christ the
[2:09:12] church if God was so made you so
[2:09:15] beautifully and wonderfully
[2:09:17] made don't you know he would do the same
[2:09:20] with his church
[2:09:23] amen so he designed us to come together
[2:09:26] in Heavenly
[2:09:28] places in our Bel the believer's
[2:09:30] position in Christ and to have
[2:09:33] Supernatural workings of God and and
[2:09:35] Outlets such as gifts of the Spirit and
[2:09:37] prophecy and wisdom and knowledge and
[2:09:39] Gifts of healing and all of these other
[2:09:42] other things are Outlets that God lets
[2:09:44] out his power don't you know he has that
[2:09:47] in his in his
[2:09:49] body amen now
[2:09:52] maybe not every individual having every
[2:09:54] one of those but but in the body of
[2:09:58] Believers God has equipped his body so
[2:10:01] the spirit could
[2:10:06] move when I threw my hand out like that
[2:10:09] a spirit moved it what was that a human
[2:10:13] Spirit but God's got a God's got a holy
[2:10:16] spirit working in his body and it works
[2:10:19] come on somebody it works through
[2:10:21] Apostles and Prophets and teachers and
[2:10:23] evangelists and
[2:10:25] pastors amen it works through the leoes
[2:10:28] and
[2:10:28] helps it casts out Devils come on Amen
[2:10:32] it has workings and miracles and faith
[2:10:34] and Divine Healing and you know every
[2:10:36] promise of God is laying
[2:10:39] there amen the body has to be
[2:10:42] functional and God is not going to take
[2:10:45] in a Rapture a body that doesn't
[2:10:47] function
[2:10:55] so therefore every gift he lays in the
[2:10:58] body is important to be
[2:11:01] there now Satan by his power if he can
[2:11:04] make the laws his laws work the laws of
[2:11:07] sin and death how much more should God
[2:11:10] make his power
[2:11:12] work if Satan what can make his laws and
[2:11:16] and and and and we recognize it
[2:11:21] how much then more should God's laws be
[2:11:25] recognized among his people of Divine
[2:11:27] Healing and Revelation and powers and
[2:11:29] gifts and manifestations of the spirit
[2:11:32] you know you you cannot even be called
[2:11:35] the bride and not have the gifts of the
[2:11:40] Spirit deny that they exist you you've
[2:11:43] denied his love
[2:11:45] gifts you you've denied the workings of
[2:11:48] the Holy Spirit you cannot be the bride
[2:11:51] and deny the gifts of the
[2:11:53] Spirit and it's working in the
[2:11:56] body so brother brandom said I I believe
[2:11:58] with all my heart we're near in the age
[2:12:00] that people are going to recognize these
[2:12:02] things we've had so much vain philosophy
[2:12:05] and teachings that ought not to be until
[2:12:07] it sets a human mind to a revolution of
[2:12:09] thinking on matters of this and that and
[2:12:11] taking it away from the word of God we
[2:12:13] start listening to the
[2:12:15] crowd but if we could just store oursel
[2:12:18] completely to God and His will and be
[2:12:20] lost our own thoughts and let the mind
[2:12:22] of Christ come in it then the operations
[2:12:24] of the spirit will work through us just
[2:12:27] as Natural Things
[2:12:29] does
[2:12:30] Amen it's you know I'm speaking from a
[2:12:34] and and just quoting from a very
[2:12:36] tremendous sermon you L need to really
[2:12:38] listen to it the fundamental foundation
[2:12:42] for Faith you can write it down go
[2:12:45] listen to it digest it
[2:12:48] now you can't have God without having
[2:12:51] his
[2:12:52] word and when you have his word you have
[2:12:56] God because God and His word is one he
[2:12:58] is the word but now you can have
[2:13:01] theology without having God but if it's
[2:13:04] truly the word it is most spirit and
[2:13:08] truth if it's really the spirit you're
[2:13:11] going to take the word and if it's
[2:13:13] really the word that you have received
[2:13:16] you will have the spirit with it I mean
[2:13:18] if you got one you have both
[2:13:22] amen you know but today there's so many
[2:13:24] times that the power lines have been
[2:13:27] clogged that is are not and it's clogged
[2:13:30] by the screams of the cloud the crowd
[2:13:33] the unbelief the darkness of the age by
[2:13:37] by the things that that come in and
[2:13:39] hinder and it hold back your faith from
[2:13:46] working but remember
[2:13:51] the only thing that hindered the human
[2:13:54] race hinders the human race from being
[2:13:57] Superior and controlling like they did
[2:13:59] in the beginning is because the power
[2:14:01] lines of the outlet of God made in the
[2:14:04] human being has become clogged up God
[2:14:07] made you to do his work on the earth
[2:14:10] you're to have dominion sometimes it's
[2:14:12] Church theology Church doctrines of Cl
[2:14:15] that actually clog up your faith
[2:14:19] lines amen you know can you imagine
[2:14:23] having this billionaire all wired for
[2:14:26] light you know uh and it's wired for
[2:14:30] light it's wired to work you know and
[2:14:33] you got an unseen
[2:14:35] force that is coming through those
[2:14:38] wires an unseen force that is there that
[2:14:42] has energy in it that can do
[2:14:45] work am man you know there was a man by
[2:14:48] the name of Ben Franklin that uh um
[2:14:51] originally got interested well he may
[2:14:54] not been the original one but he was one
[2:14:56] of the in in many of our textbooks we
[2:14:58] hear about um Ben Franklin you know he
[2:15:01] he thought there was electricity in the
[2:15:03] heavens so he got a flew a kite and the
[2:15:06] in a storm and and I don't I doubt that
[2:15:10] he really got hit by the lightning but
[2:15:13] he probably wouldn't have lived through
[2:15:14] it but you know there was static
[2:15:18] electricity that came down that kit
[2:15:20] string
[2:15:22] and he screamed out I got
[2:15:24] it I got it it's electricity it's it's
[2:15:28] there it's in the
[2:15:30] heavens and then you have a man by the
[2:15:33] name of Thomas Edison come along and he
[2:15:36] says hey we got it but I ain't just
[2:15:39] happy with saying we got it I want to
[2:15:41] put it to
[2:15:45] work I want this thing to light up the
[2:15:48] world and so he would try wire after
[2:15:51] wire after wire to that would would hold
[2:15:54] the light and would keep it it going
[2:15:56] there and F fix it in a vacuum till he
[2:15:59] invented a light bulb that would only
[2:16:01] last just a few just a few seconds and
[2:16:04] then longer and longer and longer and he
[2:16:06] gave the world a light
[2:16:09] bulb because he had a
[2:16:13] vision he had a vision you know the
[2:16:16] power is
[2:16:17] here the power is in the heavens the
[2:16:21] power is in your hair
[2:16:24] electricity amen power works in your
[2:16:26] body electricity works in your body and
[2:16:29] goes from sell to sell and and and makes
[2:16:31] your your body work and
[2:16:33] function electricity is in the world
[2:16:36] electricity is in the heavens electric
[2:16:39] is in the building but it's got to be
[2:16:41] put to
[2:16:43] work and what I'm trying to say is we
[2:16:46] got power in the word we got examples in
[2:16:49] the word we got promise in the word but
[2:16:52] it's got to
[2:16:54] work it ain't just good enough to stand
[2:16:57] up and say oh my we got
[2:17:04] power now of
[2:17:05] course we've had electricity long enough
[2:17:08] now that if you
[2:17:12] know if you went and plugged in your
[2:17:14] iron to when you was coming to church
[2:17:16] this morning plugged in your iron going
[2:17:18] to iron your clothes and it wouldn't
[2:17:20] come on
[2:17:21] you wouldn't say oh I always thought it
[2:17:24] there's no such thing as
[2:17:29] electricity no you say there's something
[2:17:31] wrong with this
[2:17:34] wiring something wrong with the wiring
[2:17:36] something something wrong there's
[2:17:38] something broken between here and the
[2:17:41] [Applause]
[2:17:43] source amen now the source is almighty
[2:17:47] God and when we plug in a promise of God
[2:17:50] and it don't
[2:17:52] glow if it don't work if it don't heal
[2:17:54] we don't say oh there's no such thing as
[2:17:56] healing no more we say there's a broken
[2:17:59] wire
[2:18:02] somewhere or somebody is taken and put
[2:18:05] an insulator there and insulated it and
[2:18:07] kept it from us but we're going to go
[2:18:10] get
[2:18:12] it amen I just say if it work once it'll
[2:18:16] work
[2:18:17] again amen if God did it once he'll do
[2:18:20] it again if he healed once he'll heal
[2:18:23] again if he saved once he'll save again
[2:18:26] if he delivered once he'll deliver again
[2:18:29] if he cast out Devils once he'll cast
[2:18:31] out Devils again if he gave baren women
[2:18:34] life he'll do it again whatever God said
[2:18:37] God will do
[2:18:40] it plug it
[2:18:49] in but we got to find the wires that
[2:18:51] will do it like Edison we got to find
[2:18:54] the wires that'll carry the current
[2:18:55] that'll make a light
[2:18:59] show
[2:19:01] now brother brandham would be given a
[2:19:03] gift by an
[2:19:07] Angel many of you here know the story
[2:19:10] some of you probably sitting here
[2:19:13] don't but in 1946 on May the
[2:19:18] 7th an angel of God walked into
[2:19:22] through a light a light come into the
[2:19:24] room and out of that light
[2:19:26] stepped a man 6' tall 200
[2:19:32] lb standing there and said I've been
[2:19:35] sent to tell you it's been sent from
[2:19:38] almighty God to tell you of your
[2:19:40] peculiar
[2:19:41] life and you've been given a gift of
[2:19:44] Divine
[2:19:46] Healing that
[2:19:47] will that will spread the gospel around
[2:19:51] the
[2:19:53] world and we know that's
[2:19:55] true you can read the historians now and
[2:19:58] they will tell you the Divine Healing
[2:20:00] movement all Roberts got his inspiration
[2:20:02] from William
[2:20:04] brandham all these other men that came
[2:20:07] along some of them were copycats some of
[2:20:09] them were
[2:20:10] sincere but nevertheless they got
[2:20:12] inspiration they saw God did it and they
[2:20:15] said we can do this
[2:20:18] too and so you you see
[2:20:22] um there there again brother bradam
[2:20:25] would have a gift and I'm not going to
[2:20:28] describe it all but like I said at the
[2:20:31] beginning of the service you know I was
[2:20:33] there in the second phase of his
[2:20:35] ministry where the discernment the word
[2:20:38] being the discernment of the thoughts
[2:20:40] and intents of heart that he could even
[2:20:42] turn his back to the congregation and
[2:20:44] call them out not even looking at them
[2:20:47] but calling from behind him like Abra
[2:20:50] Abram did to Sarah or in Abraham's day
[2:20:53] when Elohim did to Sarah in the tent
[2:20:56] behind
[2:20:58] him now it was a gift of God it was to
[2:21:01] show us the power in the
[2:21:06] word it was to vindicate a
[2:21:09] message now but he would tell us he said
[2:21:12] now friends that doesn't heal
[2:21:16] you you see that only brings a person up
[2:21:19] in faith
[2:21:21] and when that person comes he may tell
[2:21:24] me he's got faith I take his word from
[2:21:26] him but under the anointing you can't
[2:21:28] come and deceive that where I I know
[2:21:31] whether you got faith or not he might
[2:21:33] think he has Faith there's a thing where
[2:21:35] people thinks they got faith and they
[2:21:36] haven't got faith but when they're way
[2:21:39] down here way down here saying they got
[2:21:43] faith and it isn't up here now what he's
[2:21:46] talking about faith has to reach the
[2:21:49] level of God's promise and come together
[2:21:54] so when your faith is down here you see
[2:21:57] there's a
[2:21:59] disconnection so you got to bring the
[2:22:01] two together your faith and God's
[2:22:03] promise his word
[2:22:05] together and so he says it's like tuning
[2:22:08] the string on an instrument when it
[2:22:10] comes up and coincides with this up here
[2:22:13] that thing ready and any demon that's
[2:22:15] got that person bound has to turn loose
[2:22:18] when that kind of Faith Comes now you
[2:22:20] don't have to come up here on the
[2:22:21] platform it'll act right out there
[2:22:23] wherever you are but that's the whole
[2:22:25] purpose of his gift his gift didn't
[2:22:28] heal healing lays in the atonement
[2:22:31] that's right ain't no preacher can heal
[2:22:34] that's right amen healing it lays in the
[2:22:37] atonement in what Jesus did not what we
[2:22:40] can do are you with me but what a gift
[2:22:43] does is it it Tunes your
[2:22:47] faith that's to believe
[2:22:51] and when you see it's for me it's right
[2:22:55] it's the word and I believe it these two
[2:22:59] come together your faith in the word and
[2:23:02] something happens there's a light
[2:23:06] show are you with
[2:23:08] me amen
[2:23:12] now we it not even just brother
[2:23:15] brandom's gift will do that the
[2:23:19] preaching of the word
[2:23:20] an anointed preacher in the Pulpit will
[2:23:24] do the same thing he will attune your
[2:23:30] faith are you with me now amen what's he
[2:23:33] doing he's taking the word he's taking
[2:23:35] the promises he's showing you
[2:23:38] examples it worked back here it worked
[2:23:40] for Elijah it worked for Jesus it worked
[2:23:42] for the disciples it worked for every by
[2:23:45] the Holy Ghost fill people the acts to
[2:23:47] church it worked everyone so it'll work
[2:23:50] for for you Jesus Christ is the same
[2:23:53] what's he doing he's tuning your
[2:23:56] faith amen he's telling you God healed
[2:23:59] that one he gives an example there he
[2:24:00] healed that one he delivered that one
[2:24:02] that man was out in sin he was an
[2:24:04] alcoholic or he was this and God
[2:24:06] delivered him what's he doing he is
[2:24:09] tuning your
[2:24:11] faith amen that what he's done for
[2:24:13] others he'll do for you too and when
[2:24:16] your faith will meet the promise
[2:24:20] the word of God then something's going
[2:24:23] to happen addictions are broken sir
[2:24:27] Hallelujah Sinners are saved demons are
[2:24:30] cast
[2:24:33] out so the gift of preaching will
[2:24:35] elevate your faith as we declare the the
[2:24:39] promises of God Amen because what are we
[2:24:42] doing we're showing you God's
[2:24:44] willingness to deliver his promises of
[2:24:47] to deliver and that he's here and that
[2:24:50] he's
[2:24:51] present so we must understand who we are
[2:24:55] and where we're positioned in
[2:25:00] Christ now I'm not going to be able to
[2:25:02] finish this
[2:25:03] sermon but I want to bring it
[2:25:06] down like
[2:25:11] Edison and like Ben
[2:25:14] Franklin we've had the Franklin that
[2:25:17] says I got
[2:25:19] it it's
[2:25:21] there it's
[2:25:23] real but they don't know how to access
[2:25:26] it they don't know how to put it to
[2:25:28] work we have an Edison that worked
[2:25:31] tirelessly day and night drinking a cup
[2:25:35] of coffee wear a away catch an hour of
[2:25:38] sleep get back up try different wire try
[2:25:41] this try that because he knew in his
[2:25:46] heart that somehow he could make this
[2:25:49] power
[2:25:53] work he could make this electricity do
[2:25:57] work
[2:25:59] now let me
[2:26:01] just bring it on the spiritual
[2:26:04] side because we have many you know that
[2:26:07] says it's there we believe the Bible We
[2:26:11] Believe it'll work we believe it's
[2:26:15] true we we see where it is oh my yeah
[2:26:18] God can do anything
[2:26:21] there's power in
[2:26:22] it but they don't know how to make it
[2:26:27] work it's like brother brandham there's
[2:26:30] a man come to him and said brother
[2:26:32] brandham I uh I want to know I want to
[2:26:36] understand how God moves and how God
[2:26:39] works says I heard about the gifts of
[2:26:42] the Spirit and he said I want to see a
[2:26:45] man that wrote a whole book on it and
[2:26:48] the man said well no I don't have the
[2:26:49] gifts
[2:26:51] but I just wrote a book on
[2:26:53] it well there's theologians that have
[2:26:55] written book after book after
[2:26:59] book but brother brandham talked about
[2:27:02] it and he
[2:27:03] says I've been like
[2:27:06] Edison I've been looking for the way to
[2:27:10] make this
[2:27:11] work and I
[2:27:13] found and I'm going to close on this one
[2:27:16] I found two wires
[2:27:20] that will make this work they've got to
[2:27:23] work in unison and one wire is love and
[2:27:27] the other is Faith and when you love God
[2:27:31] you will have faith in his word and that
[2:27:34] will connect you to the Dy and the
[2:27:37] current will flow but if you let doubt
[2:27:40] and fear and unbelief block the way it
[2:27:43] will not work but if the moment I get
[2:27:45] whatever God can lead your soul to
[2:27:48] believe that's yours
[2:27:51] and I want to say today we've seen it
[2:27:54] work we've seen it heal we've seen it
[2:27:57] deliver we've seen it love and faith of
[2:28:01] people who love God who love his word
[2:28:04] who keep his Commandments and faith that
[2:28:08] God's going to do what he
[2:28:11] said and it
[2:28:14] works it works it heals the sick it
[2:28:19] casts out devils
[2:28:20] it speaks with no tongues it has Outlets
[2:28:23] of gifts of the Spirit it
[2:28:31] works that the musicians
[2:28:37] come do you want it to work in your life
[2:28:41] go get in love with
[2:28:43] Jesus with all of your
[2:28:47] heart and when you really love him
[2:28:50] you'll believe him whatever he
[2:29:00] says cuz he cannot deny himself and you
[2:29:04] as his child cannot deny
[2:29:09] him want you to Bow your head just a
[2:29:11] moment
[2:29:17] [Music]

[2:29:27] sermon on the mountain

[2:29:36] moved
[2:29:38] throughout dealt with
[2:29:41] hearts things are happening in the
[2:29:43] Unseen realm things that you can't see

[2:30:48] him speak to him and just
[2:30:50] told him said you
[2:30:52] know we have to protect the church from
[2:30:55] the hard bruises of
[2:30:58] Satan and when things like that and
[2:31:00] Christians misbehave and churches split
[2:31:02] up and fusses come among Believers it
[2:31:05] HTS and wounds it bruises the woman the
[2:31:09] church with a
[2:31:11] child you see you don't you're not full
[2:31:14] term just by just being justified
[2:31:17] Believing on Christ that's the
[2:31:19] conception
[2:31:20] growth in the womb is
[2:31:23] sanctification be can people can live in
[2:31:25] that kind of stage for many years in the
[2:31:28] womb of the church but if they never
[2:31:31] came to a full
[2:31:32] birth then when Trouble
[2:31:35] Comes the baby is
[2:31:38] aborted and the church will always lose
[2:31:41] those they get hurt they get wounded and
[2:31:44] fall
