God and that you give us a here and ear to receive but we ask it in Jesus name amen amen God bless you we'll ask you to take your seats it's just good to be in the house of the Lord today and see each one of you that has gathered with us we still have a few that are out but um we ourselves just returned from Virginia where we had wonderful meetings there with brother Ron Spencer and the Believers there and um I want you to thank you I want to thank you for supporting the services while I was gone and thank you for for those that are have come this morning and being here in the service today if you're a visitor I hope you won't feel like a visitor when it's all over but you'll just feel like a part of the family of God and so we welcome you today you hadn't been here in a while well we're just happy to have you today and in the service the Lord if it's your first time isn't it well we're glad to have you amen it's always good that we can have the Gathering of God's people to come together together to Worship the Lord together with us I also wanted to say I really appreciated brother Joshua Martin coming and taking us two of the services while we were away he's a talented and gifted young man and from what I witnessed and the report said I received I he did an outstanding job and you were blessed last and we're so happy about that that is wonderful and brother Aaron Oglesby as I mentioned in prayer him in the Burns family they're up in the North Carolina and he's preaching for brother brother Aaron is preaching for uh brother Josh Bennett and also brother Joe greenes this evening so you can remember them in prayer they'll be traveling back home and we certainly are thankful that God can use them in a very very special way and I believe that and also as us coming in I just noticed that we've got a lot of work that has been done and I I don't know if you pass by the back of the church there and got to look there but we got a first class beautiful handrails going down the steps out of the out of the fellowship hall to go down into the Pavilion there and it just it's just classy that's all you can say about it it's a job well done we certainly appreciate all of you that were involved in there also I got him a real little job to do also I bought them a little that not them I bought the children a little teeter-totter thing to add the mummies Park out there and and it had to be assembled and that can be a brain scrambler in itself but they got it done and the children already been enjoying it and and so we really appreciate that and then we see the the post up for the adult porch swings and the fire pit that we're putting out there I just want to say I appreciate everything you've done I just want to say you're the best you are the best and I'm I'm so proud of you as a congregation and love you with with all of my heart today also um I'm um I'm just um I want to read a scripture here um for a moment and uh just um just to kind of set the the tone for this it's in first Timothy three and eight and you won't have to put it on the board up there but I just want to just kind of bring it to your memory and this is about the qualifications of deacons deacons are to be worthy of respect and sincere not an indulgent in most much wine not pursuing dishonest gain it must hold the Deep truths of the Faith with a clear conscience they must first be tested and then there's nothing against them they shall serve as deacons same way their wives are to be worthy of respect not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy and everything and a deacon must be faithful to his wife and manage his children his household well and those who have served well gained an excellent standing and great Assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus and these are the words that the Apostle Paul left us for um the church and for the order of the church and certainly we have carried on that even as brother Branham did and and most Christian churches do something very similar but um we're certainly following the example of the prophet of God and the Apostle Paul and um and so today we uh because we are having the meeting coming up and we're going to need some more help and um we and so on like that I'm I'm going to um today nominate a brother here and I would like brother Derek Paris to stand if you would so everybody would know who that he is who we're talking about he's been with us over a year now and we've come you've had a chance to get to know him and his family and and I already say they've been a great asset to our church and um but because we are in need of another Deacon with the upcoming meeting I've nominated him and he's willing to serve and at our next business meeting we will do this again in a more formal manner but for now I'm just going to ask him to now be seated and um just about his head and that you will with the cameras make sure you just have them directly upon me and um and so with um with that consideration and denomination that I made I'm asking you for a vote uh with a show of hams and that if you are a member of the church here and um you support it with your tithe and offerings to con to confirm his um his nomination today so if you would just raise your hand let me see all right all right so I'm seeing a great majority here today so brother Derek if you will if you'll just come stand right here for a moment we're just going to ask the Lord's blessings upon you in a great way today as we ordain you as a deacon in the house of the Lord Brother Timothy come with me amen father when you left us here you commissioned disciples and apostles and you set them forth and then Lord the following Church saw that there were need of those to to help in the assembly and Lord you have blessed us with men and we have great men in this assembly that you have surrounded around the gifts of God with and Lord today our brother Derek Paris is here and he stands before you and before the people of God and we asked your blessings upon him in a mighty way as we ordain him for the service of head Lord that he will be equipped with wisdom to help your people oh God into encourage us and support the ministry as we go along life's journey I ask Lord your blessings upon Him upon his family his home his business everything Lord that it would be an Abundant Blessings from the almighty God we ask it in the name of Jesus that you will grant It For Your Glory as we ordain him as a deacon in the house of the Lord amen God bless you brother Derek amen we love you amen amen amen praise the Lord amen we're going to sing this song as you stand together with me again it's Jesus on the inside he's working on the outside oh what a change in my life aren't you glad for that change that you have that the Holy Spirit does its work and does its Grace in our lives and changes us from the inside out well it's Jesus on the inside working on the outside oh what a change in my life foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] my life haha I'll be inside [Music] oh what a change in my life [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen aren't you glad for that change and if you haven't changed you I pray for this service is over you'll be changed in his presence turn with me to Genesis Chapter 18 and we'll read from verse 1. if you were not tuned in with us in um in Virginia you have missed a part 167. and um where I spoke on investigating angels and so if you have not heard that well you know if you want to stay up with what we're doing and what we're ministering will it be good that you would do that we were really blessed in in the services there it was powerful meetings brother Timothy did you proud and brother Donnie Reagan of course blessed us in such a waste Sunday morning we were really tremendously blessed by his ministry and and of course we all love brother Ron Spencer and they gave they were wonderful hosts and and we had a wonderful time together and um so let's look here to Genesis Chapter 18 and we'll read from verse 1 and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and low and looked in low three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and said my Lord if now I have found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant may God bless you as you're seated I have been talking about this being the climax of the meetings where that God had appeared unto Abraham and so today I I want to just take it a little further here today as we look at this and the title is going to be a little bit strange but it also has to do with our trip that we've made and the events that I witnessed and saw and I'm going to speak on taking The High Ground for the Ascension now of course The High Ground meaning coming to the climax and this is where that Abraham and Sarah would come to this uh such a climax meeting and um to them would be a revelation of um from Jehovah directly to them Elohim would reveal himself under the oak tree at mam at mammary and there in that in that great meeting would be the climatic time just before the change of their bodies in order to receive the promised son and as we kind of go through this you know as I as you know I've just returned from up in uh Virginia after the meetings we also went into Pennsylvania and um and to Maryland Pennsylvania and on up there we toured the battlefields of uh Antietam and and Gettysburg and of course um you really missed out on a treat we had our own personal tour guide brother Aaron ogles made that and that took us through every step of it and just explained to us so beautifully and and it was very very inspiring that we had those moments together and um as you know the battle at Antietam was fought on September 17th in 1862 as the bloodiest day in American history with a combined total of 22 717 dead and wounded are missing and um and although the Union Army suffered heavier casualties than the Confederates the battle was a major turning point in the Union's favor and so we were able to go there and look at that as you know today is September the 11th it marks um now the great tragedy that happened with the twin towers and and the attack upon America and many are still today mourning that then uh as to that was a a great event here in American history now and um but you know of um of all of these that were were dead and wounded in the Civil War America is never lost that many men in any battles since that time in July the 1st through the 3rd 1863 there was the Battle of Gettysburg in history records now the mistakes of the battles and there's always the what ifs and the how comes and you know let me tell you now as we stand here today the threat of civil war is not over there will be another one and it will be between the liberal left and the conservative right you see well I know what side I'm on well I can tell you right now it's not going to end well for the conservative right even now Christian people are being castigated they are being called deplorables they are demonized by the U.S president as a threat to democracy they are angry as they insist on their freedoms freedoms to kill babies by their own children by abortions freedom for same-sex marriage freedom to practice sodomy freedom for porn freedom to commit crimes and not face any penalties freedom to flood our nations with immigrants and the absolute Spirit of lawlessness as freedom from religion anti-god and Antichrist and America's heart has turned evil as he speaks as a dragon instead of a lamb this is happens and by prophecy according to revelation 13. and and like I said it's it's not going to end well for the righteous people the Bible said in Revelation 12 17 and the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed which keep the Commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ and we know that day there will be a great Slaughter and and those that will give their lives during that time they will they will sleep until the Millennium is over and it's a white Throne judgment there will catch up with the rest of us entered into life with the bride in the holy city and the rest of them um there um on the on the outside of the city in the the new heavens and the new Earth but there's another battle that happens before this one that I want to talk about and it's the Battle For The High Ground of Ascension the dead in Christ are waiting to be freed and glorified they're in a Holden place and we must reach the height a promise for those who are alive and remain to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and here today every gun of hell has fortified itself upon this hill take in this position to make sure we do not achieve The High Ground where Jesus Christ will be the captain off of his bride in this Bible we have ADD Christian men in their armies we've had them in the past we've had the Baptists that made its heroic advancement to a immersion and then that position denied infant baptism uh and and they were for this reason they were called anabaptists or re-baptizers and even took on the name many of them took on the name of dunkers you know it was a slang term referring to them people that that would not receive the Catholic um baptism of infants but insisted that uh it be when a person come to know Jesus Christ and made that conscious decision uh to accept him as Lord and Savior it would be them that they would be only then could it be baptized and and so from there were the battle divisions of of men like the Amish and the Mennonites and the Hutterites out of these anabaptists that men who battled for freedom of religion that's why they came here to America even because in the other countries they had been hunted down and and persecuted and slaughtered they have many many Heroes among them of men and women who died valiantly for the cause of the truth that they had failed and they but but they were hunted down and persecuted and slaughtered and battled but only to retreat to just become enslaved to a set cut off from The High Ground of the Ascension and the Rapture of the church And Then There came the Great Awakening it was a serious series of Christian revivals that swept Britain and the 13 North American colonies in the 1730s and 40s that was the first Great Awakening and it was led by Heroes of Faith famous generals like Jonathan Edwards and John Wesley and George Whitefield who led the troops forward to to Proclaim God in their generation and they charged that Hill and and you know in many of these cases these men seemed like with almost taken only to be driven back only to to be defeated and and lose the battle and these mountains well you know would be would be men who fought for Holiness a Sanctified life and that would climb that hill and try to fight for the position for the Ascension and they were in that that first Great Awakening they would they would get new recruits and fresh troops from the Second Great Awakening and Generals like Charles Finney and and Dwight Moody and and the ones like that would push up Ascension heal only to be pushed back and Retreat to an encampment of enslaved men and today the Methodist Church for example the Sanctified church is anything but sanctified Holiness is gone righteousness has been destroyed and then there they are imprisoned and Powerless and enslaved and totally conquered why because they were coming up they'll sits and heal and they fell back under the attack of the enemy this is what brother Branham said about him and how can I overcome and he speaks about our age he said this is the age of Life the personal life of Christ where the chemical in his body what was in him first under justification the water baptism second under the the new birth of Wesley sanctification which cleanses and thirdly under the baptism of the Holy Spirit putting that Sanctified vessel into service and the word sanctify means a is a compound Greek word which means cleaned and set aside for service and now the Holy Spirit puts it in service and we'll notice when the unclean spirit is gone from a man he walks in dry places I want you to understand they got a deliverance and they would give a temporary victory but only to be pushed back into unbelief again and so he said that's exactly what the church has done when the unclean Spirit has gone from a man walks in God places exactly what the church has done Baptists and methodists who believed in sanctification and then Jesus said the unclean spirit that went out of him returns to this church body and founds a house garnished swept clean living Pure Clean lives all right but then if that house isn't filled if it isn't occupied then it comes with seven other Devils evil demons worse than he was and the last AIDS of this place is seven times worse than it was in the first place they would have been better to say to Luther that it would be to receive the light and fail to follow it so will it be with the Pentecostals you know what I mean the house is garnish as I was talking to someone the other days said they're careful they're very careful even many of the Holiness groups not to call the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost because they identify themselves with Pentecostals when they do that they say holy spirit and to see to keep from saying Holy Ghost because the Pentecostal common people just call it what the Bible says holy ghost which is the Holy Spirit and Holy Ghost is the same thing but they're very careful about it they don't want to be identified with him tongue-speaking people and that's the Holy Spirit itself see what happened then when the enemy that went out under sanctification that was washed out returned back and found the house not filled with the spirit and and with the Holy Spirit now the state of the church is joined in the league of churches with the World Council of churches and it's a state that now connects it with several Roman Catholic Catholicism in all the uh the rest of it and now it's seven times worse than it was when it come out of the Lutheranism that's where it takes the man and then look at the laodicean church age after it received the Holy Ghost with the knowledge of the Holy Spirit of the spirit of God within it and then the works of God is denied by that and called an evil work then what about that there's what Christ has put out of his own church see it never showed him in the church until he come to laodicea and then he got the laodicea and he'd been put out of his church and was trying to get back in see justification never put him in sanctification just cleaned the place for him but when the baptism of the Holy Spirit came it put him in the people and now they turned him out and when he began to show himself that he's the same yesterday today and forever they turned him out because they have denominated and the spirit of the Lord don't agree with denomination you understand now they put him out we don't want nothing to do with his telepathy it said the devil or it's fortune teller they don't understand eyes can't see see ears can't hear and God only opens eyes as he Wills he hardens those who you hardens he wishes to and gives life to those he desires to that's what the scripture says now we see these hours that we're in the states and we see what it is and the Holy Ghost rebuking the age that put him out but in all that did you notice to him that overcometh amen even in that worldly Wicked Church age him that overcometh we find that God has always had Overcomers he's had Overcomers in every age they're always every time and every age that has been on the earth God has always had somebody that he can put his hands on as a witness in the earth he's never been without a witness though sometimes just one but somebody overcome now just like the Saints of old Hallelujah aren't you glad it says out to him that overcometh he couldn't say that unless there's somebody going to overcome amen so he's already prophesied somebody's going to overcome in the most evil age that's ever been somebody's going to be successful to get up of sense and heal and there will be a Rapture and a resurrection [Applause] we must take The High Ground at Gettysburg that was what is called the high water mark it's a hill that does not took refuge on and resisted the rebel charge and this was the closest that the South it came to went into war from there that would win some battles but like water they would recede to defeat they came so close to winning for the first two days the battles they did win but the third day after several times have almost winning they were defeated at the Battle of Gettysburg I stood upon that Hill I wept I did not weep because the the South lost because I too wanted to just cause for all men to be treated equal and verse slavery to end but I wept because I know that we as a bride of Christ are coming so close to women and every demon of every kind has gathered on the Hill from where we are to ascend from and we cannot just make the high water mark and recede back and lose the war but we must take the hill we must not just make it to the hill and fall back but we must ascend amen our families are dependent upon it the dead in Christ are dependent on it Heaven awaits and Earth must recede Hallelujah The High Ground that we must take is the top of the pyramid brother Adams told us in their message adoption let me just read this to you he said now this may choke you to death but you know that men that are sons of God are amateur gods how many ever knew that how many knows Jesus said so the Bible said did not your law say that you're gods and if you call them Gods which Genesis 2 said they were Gods because they had full domain over the Dominion of the world and he gave his dominion over all things he lost his godship he lost his sonship he lost his dominion and Satan took it over and that's where we've been for the six left past six thousand years but then he said but Brothers we are waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top when full sons of God will be manifested when the power of God will walk out Hallelujah and take every Power the Satan's got away from him yes sir it belongs to him brother Branham uses a pyramid as an illustration and it built the Pyramid and it is today without a Capstone it is a sign a Bible to fear of future Generations in fact brother Brandon would call it the second Bible and he said you know it's a Bible to the future generation that one day the Capstone will come Enoch called it the place of Ascension that's what pyramid is what's to mean the place of Ascension and the Egyptians built replicas and made it the place of the Dead and this is what has happened instead of denominations building onto the Ascension they have become graveyards and places for the Dead it was a pyramid that was have been capped off and to be complete and he used he showed this to use and and he would use this type of a pyramid to to um to show three separate things separate distinct things that was necessary to be kept or completed we're going to talk about some of those today first of all you as the individual the believer must be kept off with by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that unites you and God together justification and believing on the Lord is only the first stage of the battle for the soul but you see sanctification then will cleanse and clear the devil out but to keep him from regaining the song the Holy Spirit must come and forever seal and forever seal the individual with the true baptism of the Holy Ghost sealing Satan out and sealing you in with God amen where you're sealed into the day of redemption it is then dwelling spirit of God it's more than just a Azusa Street anointing on the spirit on the human Spirit where you get excited and dance or shout or jump or have emotion but it's the indwelling spirit of God the literal life of Jesus Christ it is the token it is your ticket for the Rapture and without it you can't go you'll be left behind defeated if you're climbing that Hill today you must reach the top to fall short of that is defeat to fall short of that means that you're Sanctified like brother Madam spoke of the church there the Nazarene church and the different ones that were ashamed to be identified with those tongue-speaking people shame that the Holy Ghost to be identified with that means that you're open forever enemy to conquer you things that you once conquered to come back again to be worse than what you were to begin with are you with me how many have you seen that come to the point of sanctification maybe they quit the drink and they're smoking their pornography or adultery or this or that the only and only to go right back in the same thing again be defeated and bring an awful shame and defeat to the body of Christ that they belong to the church the local body how many times have we have seen that along the journey because man stopped stop somewhere in their Ascension for the Holy Ghost I didn't get capped they let something keep them back hold them back and I want to tell you to be held back to stay where you are is defeat you must advise if you have not received the indwelling spirit of God and been capped off with the baptism of the Holy Ghost that seals you and God together you will wind up in defeat the only way you can be a conqueror is to climb that Hill you begin with your faith that's a good place to start you add to your faith virtual knowledge separate faces and all of that but let me tell you God wants to take you all the way where that you achieve the greatest achievement that a human being can have and that is forgot to come down and dwell on the inside so you are a pyramid that must be kept The Headstone must come it is great to start with a Cornerstone of Faith but you must be sealed to the day of redemption number two the mysteries of the word of God must be finished or kept it spoke of this in Revelation 10 7. that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begin to sound the mystery of God but be kept finished so you see it would be it would be capped by seven Thunders and this would restore the church back to its original condition by restoring the pure gospel that Paul preached and I just want to say to you it's something that we must we must hold on to and possess because it has been kept there's not another Revelation coming the Mysteries have been revealed the rapturing faith the faith the Revelation for the Rapture has already come it won't come by somebody else God sent it by his seventh angel to bring a message in this last day to cap off and finish the mystery ever mystery needed for the Gentile bride has already been revealed and I just say don't go beyond it don't try to go beyond it don't leave it don't embellish it to do that is to retreat from that position hold that position it must be held now the third one of course for God will cap off the church he will cap it off with the literal coming of Jesus Christ but let's talk about this one for a moment I'm just gonna take just a moment on this one a little longer than I did on the one before because we preached much about the necessity for the baptism of the Holy Ghost but I want to bring it to you where brother Branham spoke about this and and um and and he he tells us the seventh Church AIDS messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers again in other words rebuild the church back to the power of the spirit not by might nor by my men's might or my men's power but by my spirit not by organization he said not by denomination but by the Holy Spirit God will bring forth the church in the last days so you see it's a work of the holy spirit that where he caps off the Mysteries the mystery truths in this last day to give you a complete word and an open book where that nothing is close to you as a believer that every truth of God's word has been revealed all the way from this from in the beginning God to even this even so come Lord Jesus in The Book of Revelation every truth has been revealed it do we need no further truth we have ascended that hill we must hold on to it it is from there God will take a people in a rapture amen don't back up from it don't back away from it but stand there on it now brother Branham in in October of 62 would have a vision and then a vision he would he would first just write it later he would tell about it but Billy Paul would type it out there um after after uh brother Branham had this Vision he asked him to type it out for him and I'm just going to refer to some of the highlights of it but he was preaching in a forest Cathedral and he was preaching to a mammoth congregation and as he was preaching he noticed he was standing in the Sun or the full light of God's word was shining upon him the light was now upon his ministry even as the light shines upon us today and there he was he was preaching to those who was sitting in the forest outside of the denominational system and this subject would have two climaxes and he was laying a background and it was getting laid and and it was a mammoth congregation as a sad the light shining through the trees and brother Brandon said it was hitting some some were still sitting in the shadows and that mount that some were getting it and some were not and people were getting tired of listening and we're physically hungry so they'd had enough of the spiritual and they started walking away and he demonstrates that they were yawning as they started walking away and and they kind of got bored with the with the word that was being preached let me tell you don't ever lose your first love don't never lose that desire and that passion for truth am I gonna seek you heard it enough you've listened long enough I've heard that tape before I've read that Bible verse before don't ever let it become common to you amen some were leaving and as they were leaving he screamed out don't leave for all these wonderful things that I have explained you you don't know where they come from and he grabbed his Bible and he screamed as he made this climax they're all found in the Bible and I'm commissioned to preach only the Bible but the congregation walked on now he was trying to give him the first climax and he was trying to tell them because they always want to know where gifts and visions and the power of God and all of that where it lay and he said they're in the word they're in the word of God they are thus saith the Lord there is promise and you you can all bear me witness my commission and stay with the word I can't go with the denominational system I can't I can't uh I can't feed your appetite although for those things I've got to give you the word gotta have somebody hungry for truth amen can't you understand the word he was he was screaming and preaching what's the matter with you you must understand it and I'm just going to say to you whether you're a young person whether you're old you're you know the word is not over your head it's not Beyond you the mysteries of God was given for you pursue them get interested in them know them know your Bible no the message comes from the Bible it's not a man's thinking it's the word of God and we find this root in his Source comes from the word of God as he said I was commissioned not to preach denominationalism I was commissioned to preach only the Bible so there as the people left he had reached a a climax of his Divine Healing meetings the people had grown tired and weary Revival fires were dying down his first climax was to get away from denominational thinking and come back to the word of God and and so as he did he said he set himself now listen he said in the world Fallen apart said look let's get back to the truth of the word God Lives alone God wants his people to live alone with him they I won't be tied in anything any Sensations tradition he wants the children obedient with his word he can place his word in that Jesus said if you abide in me and my words in you then ask what you will that's either the truth or it isn't the truth and if it's the truth it will work and I just want to say that to you if it's the truth to you it'll work amen if it's the truth to us there will be signs there will be wonders there will be Divine Healing there will be Miracles there will be genuine experiences and young people will be filled with the power of God and the old Delight amen but you see it all begins with the word so he goes on to say now you want to know where the secret lies the power of visions and things is back to the word it's the word of God Jesus was the word and he was a manifestation of the word God was in Christ reconciling the world himself and he was the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was made flesh and the word wants to be made our flesh so the same scriptures that spoke of Jesus it wants to come in your flesh God's looking for believers today now so he thought you know they'll be back in the evening time and he began to plan he began to plan his second climax and he said ah you know the Shadows are going to fall and they're going to come back and when they return this congregation gathers in I'll put the climax to them and told them the things that they've seen me do is found in the word of God not in a mythical book or some organization but found in the word every minute because I'm commissioned for that and he said but for the most of the people it's been mythical to them or mystical to them most of them and and of course the first message when they saw it they were everybody rallied for it and Oh Glory to God if I could see this or that or the other and then they'd go away the same way that they came in how many even came across the platform were healed by the in the presence of the Angel only to go back and live the same old kind of life go right back to the systems and religions of men who denied the word but he said the Shadows are coming and then late December he would see after that Vision he would see another vision of seven angels coming to him and a vision and he said Oh I thought oh my it's coming with my message it's my second climax they're coming to bring me the message from the Lord and I screamed out with all my might as loud as I could oh Jesus what would you have me to do and when I did it went away from me and he said this climax it was yet to come he's standing there on the eve of the seals being opened and he says remember the second climax is yet to come there will be a message remember my message here the opening of that Capstone were the seven voices and seals is not even written in the word of God remember it took me into that pyramid as he said I went into that pyramid of seven angels and there he showed me things as you know neither tonight he would meet with an angel of God who would reveal to him the contents of that seal where that today we know who the White Horse right is the red the black the pale we know what it represented we know who the souls under the altar were we know we know that at the Great Tribulation that lays ahead and the seventh seal which is the breaking of the silence all of these things that we have been made privy to because you see he he was determined to reach that second climax it wasn't enough to get halfway up the hill he must reach the climax where that the original faith that was once delivered to the Saints could be restored back to the church again to where we can have the gospel that Paul preached untainted and uncolored by denominator nationalism who had colored it in so many ways until God was no longer one but three who had taken away the true baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and replaced it with titles who had taken of the original sin and make it an apple or some kind of fruit on the tree rather than rather than the the seed of The Serpent and what happened there in the garden are you with me amen you see that had to be opened to us so that we can come back to the original faith and this General this prophet of God he drove hard to get up that hill to restore us back to the original Faith again whether we have what Paul preached so he would say as he's looking to adult toward that I believe she's ready to strike that final climax to bring forth the faith that will Rapture the church into glory and she's laying in the messages where really at the end time we talked about it and and everything but the thing has moved up on us now and here's here it is now and indeed he had been laying of sermons and then he had been he had been moving toward this climax building up to it before then as you know he would preach on the seventh churches the revelation of Jesus Christ he would preach wisdom versus faith and and um spoken word is Original Seed and the seven with the 70 weeks of Daniel which would Place Israel's in their promises and and separate what belongs to us from what belongs to the Jews and he said I believe she's ready to strike the final climax so we are here I want to say on this part we are here if you ever see the holy ghost from that part phase one for you as an individual amen you are there you have a ride you have a chicken for the Rapture there's no going back and there's no defeat you have won you have won Hallelujah the battle is over the soul has been conquered the conquest has been done the devil's been driven out and you have ascended and you will Ascend you got a ticket in your hand you have a right to a rapture Hallelujah but he said I believe she's ready to strike that final Climax and I want to say this this message is the final climax there's nothing Beyond it the next message is for the Jews and so it's the final climax for the rapture to get that predestinated seed so it'll complete the body because we cannot leave but cannot go and leave one behind amen there's some of you that God is waiting on you amen God is waiting on you to get that revelation that the Mysteries have been revealed that you know your position in the word [Applause] that you know who you are that you cannot be deceived because he has put the word on the inside of you and you can't deceive the word every name that's in the Lamb's Book of Life Will Come he'll dip it in his blood he'll do whatever he has to do but believe me he's going to get his bride the prophet bringing those Seven Seals brought the final climax of his ministry and that is brought about a faith for the rapture we have now the doctrines of the prophets and the apostles we now have the Gospel of Jesus Christ yes the Baptist had part of the Gospel when they preached a mercen amen the the the the different ones the Pentecostals the methodists for example they had the gospel in the in that they preached sanctification but I never until this age since the beginning where the church felt are you with me where they fell from that lofty position of a Ascension Hill and defeat began to happen and enslavement began to happen with the Catholic Church rising up and in her we found the souls of men he enslaved them and every system of religion does the same thing it enslaves men and women but the Gospel of Jesus Christ was to bring freedom hallelujah amen it was to be freedom in my life freedom from sin freedom from unbelief Freedom there to have everything that God promised brother Branham knew that the last mystery to be added to the church would be the seven Thunders or that second climax he said that I talked about the other day in reference to those Thunders that were going to be revealed is it something coming forth from the for the church now you may wonder what are those Thunders they're the Mysteries contained in the Seven Seals amen one time they were sealed up we didn't know what it meant White Horse and we don't know who what it is or who it is some say it's Christ some say it's this some Say it'll happen all over in the tribulation some says it's already happened some says this you know everybody's got their idea it's like I've explained many times you use that illustration in the days of Daniel something is written many many tackle you parsing but nobody knows what it is a hand is ridden it something that's been written by God and nobody knows and astrologers and the wise men are common they guests and we've got books of them Matthew Henry and Seuss's apocalypse and and uh you know we got the uh Jameson's faucet and brown and we got all kinds of theologians from every denomination who have come up and looked at it many many tackle you Farson and they don't know what it means everybody's guessing I think it means that I think it means that and when they'll be they'll put they'll do a denomination on this one or that one this is our camp and this is what we believe but nobody knows until Daniel the Prophet is called and when Daniel the Prophet is called he looks up there and he said I tell you what it means you are weighed in the balance and you're found wanting that's exactly the way it is with this generation it's a generation whether they're awaiting the balance and they are found wanting are you with me amen this but but again nobody knew until a prophet came we had things in the Book of Revelation we didn't understand man guess that theologians said this that but it was everybody's guess until the prophet came and when the seventh angel sounded his message the mystery of God was kept off [Applause] he would be shown this in junior Jackson's dream of coming up the mountain there and he said that I was doing it I was revealing some mysterious writing on the side I was telling telling showing the mysterious writing along the side but I got up to the top and when I got up to the top it was capped and he said a tool was given to me from heaven and I took it and I opened it and white light or he said it was White Rock White Stone a revelation pure Revelation that light had never shown them before it had never been given nobody had known until the last days and it wasn't something outside the Bible it was revealing what was in the Bible you see because it's the word of God it can't be a revelation outside of the Bible or we're cursed amen is going to bring you back to what Paul taught or we're cursed yes are you with me but the second climax that that he said it come in and it was you see now listen to this the message Paradox I want to just kind of read this for now instead of paraphrase it whatever church ever organizes a message ever organized it goes on the shelf and it never rises again you see they're defeated not to hear historians here I know one of you see and then that's right it never rises again when it organizes Catholicism was the first organization called in the Bible of Horror and she was the mother of harlots the same thing organizations you see where it's all winding up again up here in The ecumenical council now I'm put out because of that amongst the organizations and brothers don't realize what they're doing it's not me I'm not put out they're putting the word out the Bible said in this layout of seeing age that Christ was on the outside of the church knocking trying to get back in there never was an age like that on the outside because that's going to be no more Church ages this is the end of it the laodicea and the age or the laodicea was the last age and Pentecost is at last days and we know there'll never be no more above Pentecost now he's obviously not talking about Azusa Street that's it and like another man like a man no other another no creature ever come could come up from its Evolution coming into a high species than man because man is in the image of God who created him there will be nothing higher this is the word wouldn't let it go any farther because he is the word and neither can the word climb above any laodicean church age and we see them every one there Jesus on the outside the church trying to get back in and that's what they've done to him when he was here first he was the word and the word when he was the word they say we got the word and the Pharisees said we got the word but the real true word they was rejecting it that's the reason Jesus said search the scriptures they testified me so again as he explained it cannot go past the word the word can't climb any higher than the seventh Church AIDS message you say well brother Tim we're in the bright age that's exactly right we are in the bright age but you see that's not one of the Seven Ages that just means that it's the time of the elect lady but the word cannot climb above the laodicean church age because it's the word God would not permit it to go beyond him I want you to know the message that we got and receive this Christ himself not another and it cannot go beyond him it must ascend don't fall back for it remember these others fell back and their Captain they're carried Captain Away by ecumenical councils World Council of churches and all kinds of things in the sodomite spirit are you with me perversion that's what I mean sodomite Spirit perversion and they've been carried away you see they aimed at the High Calling and and lost their grip and I tell you it's not just enough to get up here on the top of the hill and look around and say we've arrived we've got to hold that position amen there is the onslaught of the enemy that will do everything he can to get you to doubt the word of God because he knows that if you doubt the word of God that then it will not work in your life it's only when you believe it that it'll work in your life that's how healing work miracles work signs work the spoken word works it all works when somebody believes what God Said who will not compromise on it now we come to the church the three pyramids three examples that he used it for he used it for the individual capped off with the Holy Spirit uniting you and God that's the Capstone it's the ultimate you say brother Tim what about adoption it is the adoption and it's not separate from the true New Birth that's what it is you see you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you so what brother Jim when is the bride going to have the power right now we're not waiting on the power oh if the squeeze would come we'll have the power let me tell you I don't know how much you want to be squeezed or how much squeeze you want amen there's plenty enough pressure in this age but you know all of the pressure of the Dark Ages and the horrible persecution never produce a raptured faith or adopted people so that's not what's going to do it it's the word of God that we have been brought to that is adopted to people and placed you and put the adoption road but the Holy Ghost upon you and we're not a bunch of cowards that gotta go hide down behind something and say oh well you know one day when the power comes we'll defeat this enemy but right now we better run scared no sir we don't have to do that we are equipped we are dressed we are commissioned we accept we are in fact we are the soldiers that are hold that position hold that Hill don't let go of it I'm speaking to abducted Sons and Daughters today that are oh yeah I know there's a fullness of adoption that we talk about the change of our body this ain't it yet but I tell you right now we are adopted Sons filled with the Holy Ghost the adoption robe upon us hey man his ring I put on my finger the authority to use his word we're not waiting on something it's already here God's waiting on you to possess your promise the third stage or the third example that he would use the pyramid for now he would say not a pyramid Doctrine no no don't even think about what they write about the pyramid is I'm just using this for an example foreign and as an example it starts wide at the base and it goes and narrows and narrows and narrows and then it gets capped off and the top the top Stones has got to match the Capstone you see it couldn't be back here it has to be up here it has to match the last stones the last stones the last ones oh brother I I hope you are realizing what I'm talking about there's not another generation that's not another church age to follow this we're at the end every way you want to figure it amen will the last Stones going in the building and we must match the Capstone when you're back down here at the base you're not expected at the base in the building of it to match the Capstone you get up a little closer it doesn't match a little closer it's closer but it doesn't match you can't put it it's only when it reaches that last few stones and that's when the Capstone comes to unite and the church who is the bride of Christ must be completed now wait a minute I know you said well I'm complete when I got the Holy Ghost yes that's a completion that's a summit well I'm complete when I receive the word the message you know he's our head and he's the head that's come to the body it's the word but the Tim it's the word and all that's true but that's another example another type but look at this the church who is the bride of Christ must be completed by the capping her with the physical return of Jesus Christ and uniting with the the living with the dead in Christ so it's not enough that's not all that's expected of you in this age just get the Holy Ghost it's not all that's expected of you in this age just to get the knowledge of the Mysteries see it all capped off with the with the seven Thunders and ever mystery truth revealed that is needed and all of that is wonderful and has its place and must happen but I'm telling you that this is the most important thing of all that the churches of Bryant Christ must be completed with the physical return of Jesus Christ he is the head of the church and it must happen in this age because there's not another age to follow that means it's all dependent on you it's all depending on me to climb that hill and possess that and be shaped by him in order to be those last stones that matches him a church that matches him in the inner Veil brother Branham talked about this he said and I just want to want to point out some things that he was referring to he said I'm writing a commentary on Divine Healing it'll be on the front pages of the commentary now it's been all put down and we know it's the truth the next thing the next thing God will step in with higher miracles and greater things on greater planes as Jesus when he was here on Earth the first coming of the Lord Jesus it showed to John the Baptist miraculous birth then the miraculous of Jesus and then it come in the healing of the sick and the discernment of the spirits and then on to the raisin of the dead and from that on down to the Earth in the heavens and everything declaring him and the Earth giving of his dead miraculous miraculous miraculous all along all the way along just keep deeper and deeper and deeper to Climax and so will it be now so he's looking back at Jesus as he was the capping off of the Old Testament amen then he said when he came as that there the captain of it all he said it came with Healing The Sick and discernment of spirits and raising the Dead the heavens declaring him the Sun the moon wouldn't shine you remember the the earthquakes and everything else it gave up its death the miraculous the miraculous the miraculous until the dead of the Old Testament actually Rose from their graves and appeared unto many is that the Bible amen this was a great climax of the of the church that Jesus brought let me tell you the New Testament Church will not be no less of a church she's a greater Church than the Old Testament Hallelujah God was in the old Covenant what about the new Hallelujah we have had the John the Baptist that has stood and he's introduced the coming word which is Christ amen amen he said that's the first four runners said Behold the Lamb of God so will this Forerunner point to a word born Pride Hallelujah he was pointing to your coming Hallelujah that the God would be here in Bride form God take it on human flesh God moving in a bright bloody doing the same works that he did with the same power and the same anointing Hallelujah until it climaxes amen healing doesn't just go away it keeps on going and going and going the miraculous continuous continuous continuous until the dead in Christ actually come right into this Dimension and when you see them you are changed to be like them amen you have not seen the depths of the miraculous [Applause] amen we have not reached this climax somebody fast we cannot fall back like the Baptist and Methodist the Pentecostal we must take a sense of heal ing all the expectation of the ages all the people of the ages the all the dead in Christ it all hinges on you winning this battle the final battle is shown in Revelation 12. there's also shown in Daniel 12 where Michael the Archangel stands up and everyone whose names are found in the book will be delivered amen you know only history now can look back and see the winners and The Losers of that Civil War amen only history can go and look back and see their mistakes and their bumbles and and the foolish things their generals did and why they're lost and why all this that's all that history can do but let me tell you friends we got more than just history although we can go but that types in the Bible and shadows in the Bible and Men down to the ages and we can look back and we can draw straight from that but there is prophecy laying in the word of God that predicts the outcome oh Hallelujah more that predicts prophesies of the outcome of this battle and I want you to know the prophecy said you're going to overcome the prophecy said you're gonna win the prophecy said you'll defeat the Devil amen the prophecy said you're going to cast him down and men and women today the word of the Lord can never fail if God said it God's going to do it if he said I'll have a pride when I spot a wrinkle or blemons or any such thing God's gonna do it all right and I just say it might well be me might as well be me Here I Am Lord let it be me [Applause] final battle is shown in Revelation 12 where Michael the Archangel fights for the liberation of God's people and brings about the Rapture of the Bride I could take a moment just take Revelation 12 and go down to it verse by verse we can just see it so plain in the scripture what belongs to Israel what belongs to us the first coming of Christ the last coming of Christ it's all Lays there brother Bradham tells us over and again in the fourth sea on third seal for seal he tells us again the Rapture takes place in Revelation 12. when Satan is cast out the bride goes up Hallelujah you know what it is it's where Angelic battles became human battles and the Bible said and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb that's not Angels he's talking about blood was never shed for an angel it's only sons of God they overcome him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death they were faithful in everything come on Church [Applause] when they were shot down or killed or whatever they were facing forward they were going forward I'll tell you the holy spirit is calling out today for our people that go forward don't fall back don't retreat you're equipped you're upset and you've got more than muskets and carbines the arms Arcana but you got atomic bombs of the word of God admonition that has been given to you to defeat this enemy at this day [Music] the truth let's just go back over to Revelation 12. I wasn't planning on this but let's do it for a minute I'm just going to look I'm just going to take a moment on this revelation 12. if you go down to verse revelation 12. one through six you go right down there and of course this is where the man child is born there's a woman clothed with the Sun the moon under her feet on her head where crowns of 12 Stars this was Israel and she being with child she cried travailing to me in birth and pain to be delivered and she was expecting the Messiah then I saw another appeared another Wonder in heaven and beheld a great and red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on his head and his tail Drew through drew a third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born brother Branham explains that over and again that was wrong standing right there a mountain Rome was there or not Rome but the devil was there in the days of Moses gonna kill the newborn children a man going to destroy them all are you with me he was right there to do it there in Moses but you know God's got bigger plans amen the devil is is he's not omnipresent and he's not omniscient he doesn't know all things but God is both amen and God is also Omni omnipotent so you see he is all of it so you see he designed something he made it available for for them and that day for salvation for a way of Escape don't you know if God did it in the days of Moses God's going to do it in our day he's never left the church without a witness somebody's going to believe Moses Moses dare was put into the Waters of the crocodiles and everything else and you know because they were killing the babies remember that's exactly the spirit that was released in the days of Jesus Herod said kill them all from two years and down and went through there and it was Slaughter of the young children trying to get the Messiah why do you think that's educated scientific evil age that is doing everything it can in our schools what do you think that why do you think they went and took the the positions in the colleges and the schools to to contaminate to kill the minds of young people to take them away from righteousness and Holiness teaching them now and and kindergarten that they get that a boy can be a girl and a girl can be a boy perversion on every level what is it it's Satan after the children amen Satan doing everything he can listen listen it's not just God God is my his heart set on young people the devil's got his heart set on young people he's going to do everything he can to defile your mind defile your body he did this to a woman that met Jesus at the well he did everything had six women or six men there to that woman are you with me contaminated in every way shapes are not covered up is that predestinated seed but the one in the beginning that said let there be light happened to be standing at the well that day and like soon down through the layers of sin and found that predestinated seed and germinated it to life that not only happened to the woman at the well that happened to every believer [Applause] the day star the sun rose upon your life and dispelled the darkness and awakened the sea the seed term of life but in the days of Moses happened days of Jesus and you can see right here in the scripture they're standing right there to get it get that man-child as soon as it was born Amen Let me see the next verse please and she brought forth a man-child who was to bring forth a millennium he was reign with a rod of iron and and but but because of his rejection millennium's been put off now but we must get it somebody here with me amen and her child was caught up or raptured unto God he ascended to God and his throne amen now notice now if you go from there to verse 7 right there is two thousand years of of of of Gentile where God is not dealing with the Jews but Gentile churches in verse 7 it says that there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels ah hope you're picking the right side this morning amen amen I hope you're on the right team this ain't North and South amen this is Michael and his angels against Lucifer and his angels there's a great battle going on war in heaven and Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon thought in his angels hey man what is it what are they doing trying to keep the Earth the bright Earth bound trying to keep a Rapture from taking place amen trying to keep us from being overcovered but I got news for him we have got a revelation that negates of Hell cannot Prevail against Hallelujah that Gates of Hell can I Prevail it shows they will try but they cannot Prevail the prophecy the word is against sacred and his army the word is on your side next verse please amen let's just look at it and what somebody say it Propel that he founded his angels fought but they prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven amen the peace and seeks sick shows us as we try to take Heavenly places we are resistant against every kind of demon power that there is against principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness in Heavenly places are you with me but I got news for him he prevailed not the depression that you're dealing with will prevail not amen the evil that is perception will prevail not the evil age that we are in will prevail now care what weapon that he comes against you no no weapon formed against you shall prosper he prevailed not and neither was their place found any more in heaven Hallelujah not only not only is the book open for you but Heaven has been open for you the way for the Ascension has been made [Applause] thank you Lord thank you Lord thank you Lord Hallelujah let's just worship him a minute amen thank you Jesus he prevailed not he will not prevail I'm telling you by the word of the Lord this morning he will not prevail [Applause] your enemy is a defeated enemy you may not see him Brethren yet but he's gonna run Hallelujah that's going to be white plans the victory all over the place with a rock going up from the pride of Christ says we've won we've won we've won we State the courts oh first nine you can be seated and the Great Dragon was repelled cast out on the run that old serpent that deceived our mother Eve that old serpent called the devil that deceived the first church amen that calls defeat down to the ages amen that old serpent called The Devil in Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him [Applause] [Music] verse the next verse and I heard a loud voice in heaven and I want you to notice where these are these are no longer on Earth these are in heaven I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation I thought salvation happened two thousand years ago at the cross it did that's where God paid for your Redemption is that right that was the payment it was a down payment on a new body it was a down payment on Redemption are you with me but now here comes full salvation amen we we had our soul saved but now we need our spirit Sanctified and our bodies changed somebody help me preach now amen because you've got to have a body that matches your soul [Applause] right now the soul you've got set war with your flesh and so when you would do good evil is present because your flesh is there all the time amen but oh I'm gonna tell you right now now is come salvation amen you just wait till I get my new body amen I can't wait to see you in your new body amen well you said now is come salvation and Street and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accused of my brother is cast down which accused him day before our God day and night this has already happening come on Church this has already happening this has already taken place we're in the process of this war we're about to win it the prophecy is for us the word is against the devil and accused of a Brethren look when the book was opened can I take a minute here when the book was opened in Revelation 5. you see the Four and Twenty Elders you know who that is that's the Old Testament Saints 12 of them and the 12 Apostles of the New Testament so the whole bride is represented by the when the lamb takes the book is that right amen so you got that you have that you have that you have the living creatures Before the Throne you've got myriads of angels you've got the lamb is somebody with me now but somebody's missing come on come on look at that read your Bibles there's something obvious missing in the days of job every time the sons of God would appear before God's Satan was present with him in the days of Zechariah when when he that there Satan was there to withstand him come on now but here is a gathering of the sons and there's no accuser there Hallelujah the accuser is missing are you with me the accusing is over with God won't hear it no more you never did it in the first place you are The sinless Virtuous pride of Jesus Christ and I heard a loud voice in heaven saying now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night mm-hmm and they what this is the voice in heaven they overcame him with the blood of the Lamb these aren't angels these are men and women just like me and you in fact This Is Us I'm reading you where you are in the Bible I have turned to your place in the scripture this is something that yes your promise laying there and they overcame him how am I going to overcome this problem brother Tim by the blood of the lamb and my testifying he's done it each day that insufficient it's over where I'm Healed I delivered I'm saved I'm a Child of God I am perfect I am blameless I am lost I am clean and yes and they love not their lives unto the death verse 12. therefore Rejoice you heavens and you that dwell in them but woe to the inhabitators of the Earth other than the sea for the devil has come down to you have a great Wrath because he knoweth he has just three and a half years and there he's going to go after all of those prisoners of War that are in the camps of denominationalism it's going to go after him and exterminate him this is Bible one more war to come one more Civil War for America not just America the world is here listen Where We Are as brother Branham said the great climax is at hand the great Warfare between the devil and God is going on and the scene has been set for the final front lines where the Clash will come and God will reign and Rule and the lamb was with them and overcome them for he is Lord of Lord and king of kings and he'll ride down over every opposition Hallelujah amen look at what we are perilous times bombs in the hangers threats on every hand Russia sells that Obama bears and I'll get in my cups back I'll take Poland Czech Republic the Serbia I'll take all of the all the outlying countries I'm gonna get them all back Rome over here is the dragon and she is getting hers back there's an image to the Beast rising up out of the land of America and she's Gathering all of hers for the final battle the host of hell is against us but when hell turns loose Heaven turns loose also when you see the enemy come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord lifts up the standard against him God's got a standard batters wave and amen going forward advancing up Ascension hill we must not fall back we must not reach a high water mark I'm not comparing this with the South and and slavery and all that ain't my goal I'm trying to try to say to you we must not get up this far and fall back that's not another age there's not another day there's not another hour this is our only only hope you must be determined get at that Hill if you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost get out that Hill if you have received the word of the message now get up that hill it's the weapons that you'll need don't be a lager don't be holding back don't stumble along the road get up if you fall and get up again if you've been wounded and hurt and religion has hurt you and this has hurt you and preachers have hurt you get up don't give up don't turn right advance [Applause] oh my The Church Must reach the high spear of his calling we must ascend we are eagles and Eagles rise higher than any other bird we are anointed to rise we are anointed to fly higher we are astronauts as brother Brandon would explain in countdown we are astronauts we're not just to be Earthbound but we are to take the heavens somebody with me now amen all of these things lays right in there science has advanced but the church is advanced and we must possess what others fell short of we're here in this day in this hour oh my we must break through every barrier there are barriers that are set us set up to Halt us there are fence rows that you got to climb some of those fence throws there without I just want just one one post would have 820 bullets in there everyone I'm meant to kill amen they were facing a array of lead and I and I'm not just trying to minimize the battle that you're under I'm trying to say the devil is there with every tactic and he's had six thousand years of practice and seven Church ages where he's defeated him time on time again and he's haughty he's self-assured he's got lots of confidence his morale is high he's determined there will not be a bride I can stop this advance there will not be a marriage supper there'll be nobody there won't be a welcome home party after preaching Sunday morning brother Donnie Reagan after we prayed for brother Ron we went into the office there was a lot of things that happened but he spoke in tongues and he interpreted as he prayed and we were praying together there at the end of the service these were the words don't hold back keep on advancing let the water flow he goes right on to say someday I'll call you for you get on the Chariot with me and ride a charity ain't just coming from me and brother Ron he's coming for you and he's going to be calling for you come on come on up here and ride with me it's time for a Triumph at home the war is about over I've got plans for you a marriage supper of the Lamb a honeymoon a millennium up ahead I've got it all laying there amen get beyond the barriers he said if you could just break beyond the sound barriers it's Unlimited amen those men would have to climb the fences get over this the stone walls they they but all of these things and all kinds of obstacles but they were anxious to get that Hill and I'll tell you friends we got every kind of obstacle that's out there today but we must the dead in Christ is waiting on us and then the Saints ahead that have went ahead of us they're waiting on us amen we must ascend we cannot fall back we cannot perpetuate the ages there are no more ages we are out of Ages there's not another Prophet promised we either succeed or we fall back and the Battle Is Lost for all after we left Gettysburg we went to the site and Sound Theater there and in Pennsylvania and there they were they were they were playing David there it was a wonderful wonderful thing as we come through the town you can see the Amish come along with their little horse and Buggies and Mennonites with a little different color just seeing them held captive by traditions of men so under a nicolaitan Doctrine a bishop decides of his district they can have rubber on the tires or not have rubber owned tires everything is regulated write down whether you can have electricity in your home whether you can have a cell phone whether you can't have one and one Bishop says you can another says you can't you're just held under nicolaitan Conquering the laity with rules and regulations doomed to horse and buggy hampered by dogma of men so you see you know as we pass through all of that and we go to the Sight and Sound and there we assembled hair and we go to watch David there and the life of David and him killing Goliath his mighty men he had a battle to win you see Israel had never conquered all the land that was promised they that great generals like Joshua and but you know remember in the days the judges neither did neptulum and neither did neither did zebulun the neither dead the tribes of Joseph but neither did Simeon neither did they conquer her all that was given to them but the Canaanites dwelt in the land but in the days of David goes up as a great warrior king and he says I'm taking all the land everything that God promised so after becoming King he just wasn't satisfied to sit there with his crown and enjoy the little domain that he had but he began to expand the borders he said we're going to have everything God's word said we could have so he would send out his mighty man and he would go with him and he would fight Israel's battles and he'd come back with a with the crown of the malachites and the crown of of the Philistines and the different crowns of the Nations that he subdued around him and brought subservient to him and there was men that had gathered around him they are called David's Mighty Men and these men there were men of Courage man who would stand for science men who would risk their lives men who would go forward and David there and see what day in a great battle he was in he just God's so thirsty and he remembered it the well at Bethlehem but the Philip Steins was Garrison there you see they had taken David's on the Homeland and had got around the well and the devil wasn't going to let him have those blessings and David just breathed and cried and said oh oh if I just had a drink from that well of Bethlehem and those Mighty Men heard the King's request or this desire and remember you remember here he was one that had been a fugitive to he had been a fugitive and ran and everything else and they had come to him though he was a fugitive they was going to stand on the Lord's Side because he knew he was coming King and let me just say we know we know there might be president's rise the queen dies and the King Rises and all this hoopla that you got going on today but we know that the king of kings and the Lord of lords is going to rain we know he's coming into power of these men knew David was coming to power they knew the anointing oil had been poured on him and the word of the Lord was upon him are you with me amen and brother Brandon will look at that and he said oh Brothers I'm in a terrible spot he said we are Garrison today with men saying the days of Miracles have passed and Divine Healing is no more and the Holy Ghost isn't for today he said who is there a man that would draw his sword and come with me and get down to the well of Bethlehem and draw a fresh drink of Pentecostal water amen that's some formal religion not something just to jump in a shout but he said real holy ghost power and bring that back and refresh our King I wonder today in this battle as we hear the message urging us on climb the hill take possession Drive the canineers of Satan off the lutherans went so far as to say that just shall live by faith he crushed the squadrons of Rome but fell back and was conquered and they became prisoners of War to a system the Baptist stood on a mercen and away from infant baptism many of them heroically gave their lives but they fell back under the pressure of the satanic Army the methodists the nazarenes the pilgrim holiness made a charge for the heal of Ascension but they only got so far as sanctification and fell back and more worldly devil possessed satanic inspired in their churches rainbow flags on the outside Herald and Harold and the perversion of the sodomy of the age the Pentecostal Revival led by God's generals Brothers Seymour got so close to he actually spoke in tongues of that Heavenly dimension generals like Smith Wigglesworth and John G Lake and FF Bosworth Made A Way for the great healing campaigns that was to follow the Healer Revival that was led by a prophet of God the greatest General since the days of Paul drove out cancers Demons of heart disease demons had endlessly crippled God's people shot at them from every side but deaf ears will open the blind eyes could see and I'm not just talking about one little children Miracles here and there right here in Little Rock Arkansas I passed by I passed by the school of the death where in the early 1950s brother Branham there's went to the school of the deaf and 150 deaf men and women were healed by the glory of God amen are you see you see a that there were other there were other men we might call them corporals or sergeants or whatever but they were promoted like like um and you might know the story of Jack Cole he went to the meeting brother Bradham says a skeptic there was a man that would die that was blind with no eyeballs and brother Bradham told him said within three days eyeballs will form and after that you'll see Well Jack he was an Assembly of God Pentecostal preacher but he was a doubter a skeptic he said ah anybody could say that and make that kind of claim and his brother Branham left the building he walked by him patted him on the leg like that and on the knee and and prayed softly a minute and he said you know you're not sick you're just worn down from preaching meetings but don't be skepticals you were you were doubting whether this was of God or not I want to tell you that this is of God and we're both fighting the same devil going and continuing the Revival because you also were called to pray for the sick Jack Cole made it around for the third day came back to the meeting he's going to make sure that all of this was true that he could be thoroughly convinced not only that day early that morning the blind man passed him and the man with no eyeballs now had eyeballs in his head but by that evening those eyes were seeing and he was shouting all over the place the glories of God and Jack Cole said himself that he knew then that William Branham was called for dispensational purpose and I wanted to say to this congregation today we must not allow Satan to reclaim the grounds that have been won we cannot Retreat from Divine Healing we cannot Retreat from gifts of the Spirit amen we cannot be afford to be led Away by false apostles some have been routed and have retreated all the way back to baptist easy believism and now they fall to where and now fall where they fell into making the baptism of the Holy Ghost a mere I believe the message some of them dropped the weapons of our Warfare and tongues is gone and prophecy is gone and why somebody some don't even want to preach any preaching anymore don't even preach this play and take and they have been captured by the devil show the term churches into morgues denying the power of God to shout of Victory is gone but there's some mighty men on the Earth you have been called for this final battle you have been hand-picked and selected God predestinated you to this age you could have come up at another age before us you could have been born 200 years ago 300 500 700 a thousand in the Dark Ages but God called you and elected you for this age and this time he called you not to be defeated he called you to be a devil defeater a serpent Bruiser a people who in this day were to be fulfilled that they will bruise the head of the serpent thy seed shall bruise the head of that serpent and I wonder today are there men and women right here in this place that can identify yourself as David's Mighty Men you may not feel real mighty but you're there you're part of the troops amen and you are hearing that your king wants a fresh drink of water he wants an old-fashioned Pentecostal Revival like he had in the days of the book of Acts he wants the Holy Ghost poured out upon his children he wants the power of God back in the church again is there a man is there a woman that says mama that's me I understand today I'm pressing on claiming Higher Ground today I'm taking The High Ground for the Ascension I refuse to be a slave any longer Amen Let The Musicians come oh God oh God as we bow our heads today as we just dedicate ourselves for costs as it moves teardrops within my own heart as I wept thinking about the men who tried in vain Lord they tried for their country for their cause for their belief Lord we know that it was wrong slavery was wrong the evil the evil that was evil so is slavery of men's Souls it's evil we must defend this at every cost we must stand for Zion we must stand for truth I pray o God that today will March to the tune of Onward Christian Soldiers not Retreat and backwards not fall back but go forward I pray Lord help us in this battle Lord help us in this battle Lord this there can be even our generals that get shot by their own men Lord we take shots from different places sometimes around the world while meeting people but Lord oh God not understanding we must take this hill I pray that we'll press ever onward let this admonition just fall deep in the hearts of your children today as we ask it in Jesus name [Music] who lives [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] I think [Music] a high place [Music] [Music]
