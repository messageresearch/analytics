[48:35] thankful for his grace on our lives
[48:38] God's good to us amen so we want to keep
[48:42] in mind as we read this morning what our
[48:45] theme is from zachariah's prophecy of
[48:48] who art thou oh great Mountain Thou
[48:51] shalt become a plane and The Headstone
[48:53] shall be brought forth with shoutings
[48:55] crying Grace Grace unto it so verse one
[49:00] of chapter 4 and after this I looked and
[49:04] behold a door was opened in heaven and
[49:07] the first verse voice which I heard was
[49:11] as it were of a trumpet talking with me
[49:15] which said come up hither and I will
[49:18] show thee things which must be
[49:21] Hereafter and immediately I was in the
[49:25] spirit and Behold a throne was set in
[49:28] heaven and one sat on the throne and he
[49:32] that was to look upon was like um a
[49:36] Jasper and a sarden stone and there was
[49:40] a rainbow round about the throne in the
[49:43] sight like an emerald and then chap 5
[49:48] verse1 and I saw in the right hand of
[49:52] this one sitting on the
[49:54] throne a book written Within and on the
[49:57] backside sealed with Seven Seals and I
[50:00] saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[50:03] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[50:07] book and loose the seals thereof and no
[50:10] man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under
[50:14] the Earth was able to open the book
[50:17] neither to look there on and I wept much
[50:20] because no man was found worthy to open
[50:24] and to read the book neither to look
[50:25] their own and one of the elders said
[50:28] unto me weep not behold the lon of the
[50:31] tribe of Judah the root of David hath
[50:34] prevailed to open the book and to loose
[50:37] the Seven Seals thereof notice this word
[50:41] prevailed means actually to wrestle with
[50:43] and overcome so he fought a battle in
[50:47] order to open the book to take the book
[50:50] and I beheld and low in the midst of the
[50:54] throne and of the V Beast and in the
[50:57] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[50:59] had been slain having seven horns and
[51:03] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[51:05] of God sent forth into all the Earth and
[51:08] he came and took the book out of the
[51:10] right hand of him that sat upon the
[51:12] throne and when he had taken the book
[51:14] The Four beasts and four and 20 Elders
[51:16] fell down before the lamb having every
[51:19] one of them Harps and golden vials full
[51:22] of odors which are the prayers of the
[51:25] Saints and they sung a new song saying
[51:28] Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to
[51:31] open the seals thereof for thou was
[51:34] slain and has redeemed us to God by that
[51:37] blood out of every Kindred and tongue
[51:40] and people and nation and is made us
[51:42] unto our God Kings and Priests and we
[51:45] shall reign on the earth in other words
[51:48] we shall bring Heaven's
[51:52] Dominion on the earth God bless you you
[51:55] can be seated
[51:57] I'm going to be speaking to you today on
[52:00] the adopted son's legal rights and
[52:05] Authority now John in this vision sees
[52:09] God on the throne and in his right hand
[52:13] is a book that is sealed with Seven
[52:16] Seals and we Ponder you know what is
[52:19] this book and why was God holding this
[52:24] now the book was the titled to the the
[52:26] Earth and the Earth of course is
[52:29] promised to the meek those that will
[52:31] humble themselves to the word of God and
[52:34] will give Christ
[52:36] lordship and for they shall the meek
[52:39] shall inherit the earth the Bible says
[52:42] so the Earth is promised to every True
[52:44] Believer as our
[52:47] inheritance and when God made the Earth
[52:49] he made it for man God ruled the heavens
[52:52] and he made um the Earth for man and
[52:56] gave him dominion and he was to subdue
[53:00] the Earth and to take dominion over it
[53:02] and bring literally bring Heaven down on
[53:06] the earth now this is God's great plan
[53:09] for the Earth because even with with
[53:12] when it's all over with God will have
[53:15] cleansed the Earth through his process
[53:18] of water baptism the days of Noah
[53:21] shedding his blood upon it in the days
[53:23] of Jesus Christ and then the Great Fire
[53:25] of God will come and
[53:27] cleanse the Earth completely and
[53:29] eradicate all Sin from it and heaven
[53:32] will literally be here upon the Earth so
[53:35] you see the book is the title that is
[53:38] showing man's ownership to the Earth it
[53:42] was the right to Heaven's life it was
[53:46] the right to immortality to Divine love
[53:49] and and peace as brother Brandon when he
[53:52] went beyond the curtain of time he spoke
[53:54] of its atmosphere and he said it was
[53:57] nothing but just pure perfect love and
[54:00] he said and and and so you see that's
[54:03] Heaven's atmosphere the love of God
[54:06] because that's God's basic nature God is
[54:10] love it's the essence of God and in that
[54:14] book uh that we're talking about are
[54:17] names and they are names of those who
[54:20] God fornew who are his sons like Adam
[54:25] was his son and these are God's heirs so
[54:29] all of God's HS are written in the book
[54:33] they are in the Lamb's Book of Life now
[54:36] there is of course another portion to it
[54:38] which is The Book of Life where all life
[54:40] is sacred and written in a book but when
[54:44] we when we come to the Lamb's Book of
[54:46] Life as it was Old and New Testament
[54:49] that portion of the Lamb's Book it is
[54:52] those who are his
[54:54] offspring those who are his children
[54:56] that are written in there and of course
[54:59] we do not become his children when we
[55:02] when we kneel at an altar we were his
[55:05] before the world began we only found out
[55:09] who we were at the altar where God
[55:12] revealed himself to us as father and you
[55:16] as son now of course as we look back in
[55:21] in there this book is a title showing
[55:24] man's ownership to the Earth it was the
[55:27] right to Heaven's life to to to Divine
[55:31] love to peace and in that book are names
[55:34] the names of every son or daughter of
[55:37] God that will come into existence and of
[55:40] course he has to intercede until every
[55:44] name that is written in that book is
[55:46] manifested on the earth and that name is
[55:49] dipped in blood so he can't call an end
[55:51] to things until every Son of God has
[55:55] come and is manifested on the earth I'm
[55:58] glad for that cuz had he done it 2,000
[56:01] years ago you and I wouldn't be in the
[56:03] picture but because there were more
[56:06] names in the book The Saints have been
[56:09] waiting there for us to come and now we
[56:12] are here believing we are some of the
[56:14] last ones that whose names were in the
[56:17] book to be manifested on the earth now
[56:20] Adam was to have Immortal Life he had a
[56:24] place within the soul to be sealed by
[56:27] the Holy Spirit he was God's son upon
[56:30] the Earth and everything was given into
[56:33] his hand he named the animals and
[56:36] whatever he called them that was the
[56:37] name thereof he controlled the
[56:40] atmospheres of the heavens and as I said
[56:43] brought Heaven down to the Earth yet he
[56:46] was a free moral agent in order for
[56:50] there to be a choice there were two
[56:52] trees that were set before him one was
[56:55] the Tree of Life which would in time
[56:58] become revealed in the person of Jesus
[57:01] Christ amen who would be the the food or
[57:05] the bread from Heaven that if a man ate
[57:07] thereof he would never die and the other
[57:10] was the tree of knowledge of Good and
[57:12] Evil which was
[57:14] personified in that ancient serpent
[57:17] called the devil and Satan now God made
[57:22] Adam a wife and she was bone of his bone
[57:25] and flesh of his flesh and he gave them
[57:29] dominion over the Earth and together
[57:32] they dressed the garden and everything
[57:34] was Heavenly because as I said they
[57:38] brought down Heaven's atmosphere to the
[57:42] Earth but there was there was potential
[57:46] danger in the garden although
[57:50] harmless unless yielded to and they were
[57:53] safe as long as they held Dominion over
[57:56] it and as long as they stayed behind
[58:00] God's word they were protected from all
[58:03] evil all sin all sorrow all pain all
[58:07] death but you see there was a serpent
[58:11] also who was right next to man he could
[58:14] reason he could talk and Satan came in
[58:18] the serpent to Eve and began to anoint
[58:21] his lips and his mind to speak
[58:25] reasonings accusing God of withholding
[58:28] Knowledge from them and not letting them
[58:31] rise to full potential you know saying
[58:34] you know God knows if you take of this
[58:36] you'll be like God and so you see that
[58:41] he as the Bible said that old serpent
[58:43] from the beginning he is there the Satan
[58:48] beguiling and yes polluted Eve by his
[58:52] message that which brought unbelief and
[58:56] doubt and an accusation that Eve
[59:00] received against God that God was
[59:03] withholding something from her that that
[59:06] would keep her from rising up and of
[59:09] course you know Satan wants to rise he
[59:12] wants to exalt himself above God and so
[59:16] his Spirit now comes anoints the serpent
[59:18] who ass serps Authority and he begins to
[59:22] take authority ministering talking to uh
[59:26] dealing with another man's mate and here
[59:29] in this as he asserts Authority then he
[59:32] gets Eve now to exalt herself and and
[59:36] and go beyond what God Said and disobey
[59:40] God's word now the Bible is clear that
[59:43] it was the woman who was deceived it was
[59:47] not Adam that was deceived you see Adam
[59:51] he was he was the word he was uh the
[59:54] word made flesh he was a Son of God and
[59:59] he was not deceived he knew exactly what
[1:00:03] what had taken place and and the Bible
[1:00:06] tells you in 1 Timothy 2:14 that Adam
[1:00:09] was not deceived but the woman being
[1:00:12] deceived was in the
[1:00:14] transgression and so seeing his wife in
[1:00:18] this Fallen condition knowing she would
[1:00:21] be banned from Heaven banned from Eden
[1:00:24] banned from the economy of God yet she
[1:00:27] was a part of him amen she he could not
[1:00:30] deny her she was bone of his bone she
[1:00:34] was flesh of his flesh amen and here
[1:00:38] Adam looks now and he hears Satan's
[1:00:41] holding something hostage that that is
[1:00:45] valuable to him that is his life his of
[1:00:49] his flesh is him and here she's deceived
[1:00:53] and here she's pulled out and here she
[1:00:56] is going to be cast out of Eden and you
[1:00:58] know what he says he makes a choice I'll
[1:01:00] go with you oh yeah right I'll become of
[1:01:05] this sin with
[1:01:06] you and we will face the wrath of God
[1:01:12] together so he actually takes on her
[1:01:18] sin
[1:01:20] now Adam traded his life of Heaven to go
[1:01:25] with his wife
[1:01:27] and Satan took
[1:01:29] position took his position as Prince of
[1:01:33] the power of the air that's right of
[1:01:36] atmospheres and the channel by which
[1:01:39] Heaven flowed to Earth became blocked by
[1:01:44] this new Prince right because this
[1:01:48] satanic Prince don't want God's
[1:01:51] blessings in Eden that's right he
[1:01:54] doesn't want God's righteousness he does
[1:01:58] want God's love and
[1:02:00] peace so you know he he wants to block
[1:02:04] off Heaven from the earth now of course
[1:02:09] he will do it of course to man he will
[1:02:12] first start with man man will will be
[1:02:15] the first to fall if you get the king of
[1:02:18] the earth to fall then everything
[1:02:22] beneath him the whole Kingdom Falls with
[1:02:26] him that's right so you see in
[1:02:28] Redemption it ain't it ain't Earth we
[1:02:30] want to see restored first it ain't
[1:02:33] animals that gets restored first it's
[1:02:35] man that has to be restored first and if
[1:02:38] you get man back in his rightful
[1:02:40] position then all the Earth will be
[1:02:42] subdued and brought back under God's
[1:02:45] kingdom
[1:02:46] again now so you see Satan then becomes
[1:02:51] the prince of the power of the air as
[1:02:53] brother Bram said in future home he said
[1:02:55] all the sin that's in the heavens above
[1:02:59] he is the prince of the power of the air
[1:03:01] he keeps off Wars off the blessings from
[1:03:05] God in there comes Thunderbolts and
[1:03:07] Lightnings and Strikes the Earth and
[1:03:09] everything from the heavens sheets of
[1:03:11] slicing rain and typhoons and storms and
[1:03:15] everything comes from above which Satan
[1:03:18] uh the prince of the power of the air so
[1:03:21] Satan took man's life and man lost his
[1:03:26] power his right to
[1:03:29] Dominion but Satan could not take the
[1:03:33] book of title that's right now he could
[1:03:36] Lord over Adam he could Lord over
[1:03:41] atmospheres by
[1:03:43] permission because Adam gave it to him
[1:03:47] he surrendered the kingdom to him and so
[1:03:50] he could Lord over that but he couldn't
[1:03:52] take the book that's right he could not
[1:03:55] take the book it belonged to man and
[1:03:59] Satan is not a
[1:04:03] man now but by man surrender to Satan by
[1:04:07] accepting his lordship Satan becomes a
[1:04:12] squatter upon the Earth he claims it
[1:04:16] because man sold it to him but it could
[1:04:20] not be sold forever right that's right
[1:04:24] amen remember God has a law and that is
[1:04:26] if a property owner was in debt and
[1:04:28] forced to sell his land in Israel it
[1:04:31] could be redeemed but until the Redeemer
[1:04:34] could come death was in his hand man was
[1:04:38] in slavery that's right slaves to sin
[1:04:41] its vices is evil right under its
[1:04:45] bondage but and and death was in his
[1:04:48] hands the Earth was under Satan's
[1:04:50] control every nation belongs to him and
[1:04:53] he governs and controls it all and it's
[1:04:56] under his Dominion
[1:04:58] right that's the state of the Earth
[1:05:01] today right because the Earth is still a
[1:05:03] fallen
[1:05:05] Place why is all of this because Adam
[1:05:09] forfeited the title deed that's right
[1:05:12] yet the Earth was not made for
[1:05:17] Satan if I just get that to you this
[1:05:19] morning if I can get you to even look at
[1:05:21] your Earth for a minute you realize your
[1:05:25] Earth
[1:05:26] Earth was not made for the
[1:05:30] devil lord it was not his for him to
[1:05:34] control possess to
[1:05:37] own that's right he is only there by
[1:05:41] permission whose permission Adam's
[1:05:44] permission come on when we were birthed
[1:05:48] in under Satan's domain coming the way
[1:05:52] of sexual birth into mortal life yet
[1:05:56] the Earth as I said was not Satan's God
[1:05:59] never gave it to him right so now we see
[1:06:03] the book of the title is returned to the
[1:06:08] hand of the original
[1:06:10] owner now of course the the title deed
[1:06:14] is in question man cannot take it
[1:06:17] because of sin he is
[1:06:21] unworthy amen Satan cannot take it
[1:06:25] because he cannot inherit the
[1:06:27] earth the promise has never been given
[1:06:30] to him so the book of title is held in
[1:06:35] escr until there can come a
[1:06:40] redeemer amen until there can come a man
[1:06:43] who is
[1:06:45] worthy not an angel not even a God right
[1:06:50] God had
[1:06:51] it certainly his hands were worthy right
[1:06:55] but the problem is is getting it back
[1:06:57] from the hands of God back to man
[1:06:59] again so you see you see the the the
[1:07:03] title had to return back to the hand of
[1:07:07] the original owner which is God God's
[1:07:09] the original owner and man had fored his
[1:07:12] rights over the Earth to Satan but he
[1:07:15] does not legally own it he becomes as I
[1:07:20] said a squatter by man's permission as
[1:07:24] as we read the scripture last weekend
[1:07:27] where he said Jesus to Jesus I I give
[1:07:30] all the kingdoms of this world to you if
[1:07:33] you worship me I'll give them all to you
[1:07:35] for their mind right for they were given
[1:07:39] to me
[1:07:41] right now so you see Adam gave it all
[1:07:46] right and he traded it yeah he traded
[1:07:50] eternal life he traded Heaven's
[1:07:54] life to go with his
[1:07:57] wife now with the title deed I lost to
[1:08:00] Adam as I said the title is now
[1:08:03] questioned Adam surrendered it to Satan
[1:08:07] Satan can't own it but he can possess it
[1:08:09] and because that Adam gave it to him but
[1:08:12] Satan don't want to give it
[1:08:14] up and for 6,000 years Satan has
[1:08:19] possessed
[1:08:20] it and he brings chaos among nature he
[1:08:24] brings death and destruction he brings
[1:08:27] chaos to mankind he brings sickness and
[1:08:32] sin and death and sorrow you see death
[1:08:36] and darkness and death is Satan's
[1:08:38] kingdom and he through which he brings
[1:08:41] Rebellion to the Earth and when he
[1:08:43] brought Rebellion to the earth now the
[1:08:46] animals that Adam once had control and
[1:08:48] had power over were now rebelled against
[1:08:52] him he could call the lion before for
[1:08:55] and they would come gentle and lay down
[1:08:58] by the lamb but no longer he cannot do
[1:09:01] it because no longer will they be
[1:09:04] subservient to him they have a new
[1:09:07] master he is now a slave and this man
[1:09:10] Adam is a slave and all nature Rebels
[1:09:13] against him the plats that he once
[1:09:15] controlled and said okay move over here
[1:09:18] no you you move out of this one's path
[1:09:20] this one needs more sunlight and he
[1:09:22] would dress the garden the the way by
[1:09:24] the word of God no longer could he do
[1:09:26] that now nature itself Rebels against
[1:09:31] him that ought to tell you a little bit
[1:09:33] about your own self this morning if
[1:09:35] you're born again your nature your flesh
[1:09:38] is always there to rebel against the
[1:09:41] spirit that's right it's always
[1:09:46] resisting oh I'm not going to praise God
[1:09:48] today I don't feel like
[1:09:50] it you know I I'm I coming to the church
[1:09:53] I you know I I just something you do no
[1:09:56] you see it
[1:09:58] Rebels against the word of God and it's
[1:10:02] always in constant Rebellion you cannot
[1:10:04] live by your flesh you cannot walk after
[1:10:07] your flesh you have to walk after the
[1:10:09] spirit
[1:10:12] right you walk by your flesh and you'll
[1:10:14] lead to
[1:10:16] corruption amen but all would have been
[1:10:19] lost except God would not give the title
[1:10:24] of the Earth
[1:10:25] to the
[1:10:28] devil he would not just let him have the
[1:10:31] Earth and
[1:10:33] Mankind no but in the process of time
[1:10:37] God becomes a man that's right I want
[1:10:41] you to get the picture on because I I
[1:10:44] want you to understand he could not do
[1:10:46] this as God he had to lay aside his
[1:10:50] godship right and become a man to win it
[1:10:54] back for are man right he had to become
[1:10:58] the man God could hand the book
[1:11:00] to all right so in the process of time
[1:11:04] God becomes a man God would not come or
[1:11:08] Jesus would not come W with in in the
[1:11:12] way of all the rest of mankind he would
[1:11:15] come virgin born he would come by the
[1:11:18] spoken word he would not come by the
[1:11:21] sexual birth he would not be born in sin
[1:11:24] and shapen iniquity that's right he
[1:11:26] would not come in the world speaking
[1:11:28] lies like we all
[1:11:31] do he would not come that way but he
[1:11:34] would come as a virgin born pure
[1:11:38] unadulterated holy clean
[1:11:42] undefiled
[1:11:44] Hallelujah so God became a man and so in
[1:11:48] his time he came a man without without
[1:11:51] sex yet by the womb of a woman and in
[1:11:55] his birth he would not be born in sin
[1:11:58] and shaped by iniquity I want you to see
[1:12:00] this Hebrews chapter 2 verse 14 Hebrews
[1:12:07] 2:14 for as much then as the children
[1:12:11] are partakers of Flesh and Blood he also
[1:12:15] himself likewise took part of the same
[1:12:19] so he says he had to leave Spirit form
[1:12:24] God form and take on Flesh and Blood he
[1:12:28] also himself likewise took of the same
[1:12:31] that through dying he might destroy him
[1:12:36] that had the power of death that is the
[1:12:39] devil let me tell you something God has
[1:12:43] one thing for the devil and that's his
[1:12:45] destruction that's his overthrow and his
[1:12:48] Ultimate Destruction that's now notice
[1:12:51] and deliver them look at this next verse
[1:12:53] and deliver them
[1:12:55] who through fear of death were all their
[1:12:59] lifetime subject to bondage for verily
[1:13:02] he took not on him the nature of angels
[1:13:06] but he took on him the Seed of
[1:13:08] Abraham so this is what God did God
[1:13:12] became a
[1:13:14] man amen to Bear to to to live here upon
[1:13:19] the Earth to face the same Temptations
[1:13:22] we Face to go through the same trials of
[1:13:25] life that we go through to overcome the
[1:13:29] devil Amen in the
[1:13:31] flesh Amen to be tempted in all points
[1:13:36] like we are you say oh brother Tim I I I
[1:13:40] don't understand god well understand
[1:13:43] Jesus because God is a spirit but if you
[1:13:45] can see who Jesus is for a minute you
[1:13:48] can see he's a man like you are a Man of
[1:13:51] Sorrows acquainted with grief
[1:13:55] amen you can see him as a man and his
[1:13:58] suffering and there's life upon the
[1:14:00] Earth right amen you can see him as
[1:14:02] someone you can approach not some holy
[1:14:05] God that's out there that you can't
[1:14:07] approach but another man a human like
[1:14:10] you are human that's right and so again
[1:14:14] the forfeited title deed now goes back
[1:14:17] in the hands of the original owner
[1:14:20] almighty God that titled the to the
[1:14:22] Earth and eternal life and when when
[1:14:26] Adam forfeited brother Brandon said then
[1:14:29] Satan's dirty hands could not take it so
[1:14:32] it went back to the original owner
[1:14:35] himself oh we're going to find it in
[1:14:37] just a minute there he sits on the
[1:14:38] throne with it in his hand the title
[1:14:41] deed oh it makes me feel
[1:14:43] religious amen the title deed to eternal
[1:14:46] life Abstract title deed to eternal life
[1:14:49] when Adam forfeited it for wisdom
[1:14:52] instead of faith it went back into the
[1:14:54] hands of the honor almighty God all
[1:14:57] right what's it doing waiting in the
[1:14:59] hands of God waiting for Redemption
[1:15:02] claims so he as the lamb symbolizing his
[1:15:07] work as a kinsman redeemer made a way
[1:15:11] for Redemption he made a way back and
[1:15:15] the Redeemer is to claim the book for
[1:15:21] man not for himself as God but for you
[1:15:26] and all
[1:15:29] men now as we hold this thought a minute
[1:15:33] now he cannot he cannot take it all back
[1:15:37] at
[1:15:39] Calvary and for ReStore man in the earth
[1:15:42] because there are more names on the book
[1:15:45] that must be manifested on the
[1:15:48] earth you see you see the the bride the
[1:15:53] bride of Christ are the names in the
[1:15:55] book so they are the book and so really
[1:15:59] to literally take the book is to take
[1:16:03] his
[1:16:04] people that's right to Rapture the
[1:16:07] church so that's the real meaning of the
[1:16:10] taking of the book yeah is to catch her
[1:16:14] up out of this Earth out of this world
[1:16:17] in a change condition in a glorified
[1:16:21] State into God's presence yes
[1:16:25] now so again you see the all the names
[1:16:31] though must be manifested on the earth
[1:16:33] and they will they will come like all
[1:16:36] the others through sexual birth and then
[1:16:39] will have to be born
[1:16:42] again of the spoken word now I know a
[1:16:47] lot of times we attribute that oh well
[1:16:48] that's how he writes children let me
[1:16:50] tell you that's every child of
[1:16:52] God Peter said it clearly he said being
[1:16:54] born again not of corruptible seed but
[1:16:57] of the word of God that liveth and
[1:16:59] abideth forever so every child of God is
[1:17:02] born of the spoken word and when you are
[1:17:06] born of the spoken word you are born
[1:17:08] like you should have been before the
[1:17:14] fall I I wish I wish that would sink in
[1:17:17] our hearts that we can really see
[1:17:20] ourselves in our in our condition of
[1:17:24] what Redemption has made
[1:17:28] us now Jesus is on his way to the cross
[1:17:32] and I want you to look at John 12 and
[1:17:34] verse 27 we're just going to examine
[1:17:37] some of these
[1:17:38] things John 12:27 now is my soul
[1:17:42] troubled and what shall I say father
[1:17:45] save me from this hour but from this
[1:17:49] cause came I to this hour yeah so here
[1:17:54] is here he's approaching now his his
[1:17:57] greatest battle now he's battle against
[1:18:01] demonic forces he's made at bindus leave
[1:18:05] leave leprosy leave even death
[1:18:08] itself had to obey
[1:18:10] him raised up Lazarus the Widow son at
[1:18:13] name yeah amen gyrus his daughter three
[1:18:16] three is a witness amen he knew the
[1:18:19] power over death he knew the power over
[1:18:22] sickness but now he says it's for this
[1:18:26] reason I I didn't just come to bring
[1:18:29] temporary healing that's but I come to
[1:18:33] I've come to deal with the
[1:18:36] devil amen that had bir you into the
[1:18:38] real
[1:18:39] birth and give you a new birth where you
[1:18:43] can be birthed have an entrance into the
[1:18:47] kingdom of
[1:18:48] God now I want you to see this as he's
[1:18:51] coming there he said what should I pray
[1:18:54] father save from this hour but for this
[1:18:57] cause this is really what I should pray
[1:19:00] this is the reason I came to this hour
[1:19:03] oh if you could just find your place in
[1:19:05] life right now that you're not just here
[1:19:08] just to dilly-dally on the earth you are
[1:19:10] here in the flesh right now to defeat
[1:19:14] the Devil that's right amen everywhere
[1:19:17] that he that he comes against you you
[1:19:19] are here as devil defeaters serpent
[1:19:22] bruisers Overcomers in this age that's
[1:19:25] right that's why you have been placed
[1:19:27] here and Jesus said I must meet this
[1:19:30] enemy Called Death right for for this
[1:19:34] reason is why I've
[1:19:37] come and then he says father make your
[1:19:40] name glorious glorify thy name and then
[1:19:43] there came a voice from Heaven saying I
[1:19:45] have both glorify it and I will glorify
[1:19:48] it again and the peoples therefore that
[1:19:50] stood by heard it and said that it
[1:19:52] thundered and others said an angel spake
[1:19:55] to him and Jesus answered and said this
[1:19:58] voice came not because of me but for
[1:20:01] your sakes now I want you to watch the
[1:20:04] statement now is the Judgment of this
[1:20:08] world and now shall the prince of this
[1:20:11] world be cast
[1:20:15] out and then he explains and I if I be
[1:20:20] lifted up from the
[1:20:22] earth Hallelujah I will draw all man to
[1:20:27] me this he said signifying the death he
[1:20:33] should die all right now so he says if I
[1:20:37] be lifted up if I span the way between
[1:20:41] Heaven and Earth that's right amen then
[1:20:45] I will draw all
[1:20:47] men through this way that I
[1:20:50] made I'll bring them back in Heavens
[1:20:53] life
[1:20:55] I'll make it where Heaven can come down
[1:20:57] into them I make it where the glories of
[1:21:00] God will be in men and women's life
[1:21:03] again and the Prince of Peace Will Rain
[1:21:05] within
[1:21:07] them so now now through this here's my
[1:21:14] victory if I be lifted up then now will
[1:21:18] come the Judgment of this world and now
[1:21:21] shall the prince of this world be cast
[1:21:25] out this is the beginning of my kingdom
[1:21:29] casting out
[1:21:31] Devils taking a moving the squatter off
[1:21:36] of what belongs to
[1:21:39] me now Jesus of course is speaking of
[1:21:43] the process that would begin at Calvary
[1:21:47] for he says now is the time for judgment
[1:21:50] on this world now the prince of this
[1:21:52] world will be driven out
[1:21:55] so here at the cross judgment would come
[1:21:59] upon the world and the prince of this
[1:22:01] world would be driven out and where
[1:22:04] would it begin I'm going to show you
[1:22:07] where it begins let's go to Romans 8 and
[1:22:10] verse3 because we want to see the
[1:22:13] beginning of the casting out of
[1:22:16] Satan the
[1:22:19] start amen the initial War
[1:22:24] to cast Satan
[1:22:26] out Romans 8:3 for what the law could
[1:22:29] not do and that it was weak through the
[1:22:31] flesh no man could overcome nobody could
[1:22:34] live righteous because of the flesh God
[1:22:37] sending his own son in the likeness of
[1:22:41] sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin
[1:22:46] in the
[1:22:48] flesh now here's his purpose here's his
[1:22:50] plan let's go to 2 Corinthians 5:21 for
[1:22:54] he made him to be
[1:22:57] sin for us who knew no
[1:23:02] sin that we might be made the
[1:23:06] righteousness of God in
[1:23:09] him so now here's what he did he made
[1:23:13] him to be
[1:23:15] sin now I want you to see the second
[1:23:19] Adam his wife who is to be bone of his
[1:23:22] bone whose names are in his book yes it
[1:23:26] is trapped in
[1:23:28] sin but he's going to do and do
[1:23:32] something that Adam couldn't do right
[1:23:34] and that is redeem us by taking on our
[1:23:43] sin
[1:23:45] now notice he would condemn sin on the
[1:23:48] flesh he knew no sin he did this made
[1:23:52] him sin that we might be made the
[1:23:56] righteousness of God in
[1:24:00] him now Jesus would take upon himself
[1:24:05] the sins of the whole world
[1:24:08] that's the sins passed this is why
[1:24:12] Resurrection could take place the Saints
[1:24:14] the Old Testament Saints would rise the
[1:24:16] sins passed the sins present and the
[1:24:19] sins
[1:24:22] future now I want you to see this he
[1:24:26] would take on him the sins of the whole
[1:24:28] world even your
[1:24:29] sins as the sacrificial lamb he would
[1:24:33] take on your sin and in death destroy
[1:24:37] the works of the
[1:24:39] devil now of course he's doing things
[1:24:43] exactly opposite yeah of what Satan does
[1:24:46] Satan exalts Jesus humbles he would
[1:24:49] humble himself to the death on the cross
[1:24:52] he would humble himself to become sin he
[1:24:56] who knew no sin righteous undefiled
[1:25:01] would take on your
[1:25:03] sins
[1:25:05] right
[1:25:07] now so
[1:25:09] Satan who is known as a prince of the
[1:25:12] power of the air he called The Prince of
[1:25:14] Darkness he's called the God of this
[1:25:16] evil age he's called the father the
[1:25:20] source of lies he's called that murderer
[1:25:23] from the beginning
[1:25:25] he's called the accuser of the Brethren
[1:25:28] his name is
[1:25:29] Tormentor devil Satan Lucifer and it
[1:25:34] goes about like a roaring lion seeking
[1:25:38] those who he may
[1:25:39] devour now I want you to notice he is
[1:25:42] not a roaring line he's an
[1:25:46] impersonator amen he's not the king but
[1:25:50] he's
[1:25:51] impersonating so he's going around with
[1:25:53] his ferocious Roar as if he's a
[1:26:00] lion but does he have legal rights over
[1:26:04] us now it's true that his lies and his
[1:26:07] subtlety brought about death and thus he
[1:26:10] has the power of death and yes our
[1:26:12] bodies are made of the earth that was
[1:26:15] cursed and there therefore they grow
[1:26:17] thorns and thisel and they will
[1:26:21] die but does he have legal rights over
[1:26:23] us
[1:26:25] no because it was through lies and
[1:26:28] deceit that he wrestled the the control
[1:26:32] of the Earth from man and lorded it over
[1:26:35] him and he's such a bold accuser he will
[1:26:38] even stand between God and his sons as
[1:26:41] he did with job and accused man before
[1:26:43] God and even accused God in his face
[1:26:46] he's
[1:26:48] bold oh yeah he'll go about like a
[1:26:51] roaring lion he roars
[1:26:55] but now I want you to look away from him
[1:26:58] for a moment let's go back in our mind
[1:26:59] to Revelation 5 we see a call for a
[1:27:03] worthy
[1:27:05] man not an angel right not even a God
[1:27:10] but a
[1:27:13] man because it would require a
[1:27:17] Kinsman a man now I want you to see he
[1:27:21] could not do this is God right so he
[1:27:25] condescended laid aside his his uh his
[1:27:29] robes as God and took on the Robes of a
[1:27:33] man the great king of glory left his
[1:27:38] throne the one who sat on the throne I I
[1:27:41] want you to see this becomes the lamb
[1:27:45] the Kinsman he takes on the form of a
[1:27:48] man to take on human battles right to go
[1:27:53] through life as you go through it to
[1:27:56] fight your
[1:27:57] Wars with you and for you that's right
[1:28:01] amen and of course the call goes out for
[1:28:05] a man that is worthy and this call is
[1:28:08] answered
[1:28:10] symbolically by a lamb that had been
[1:28:13] slain
[1:28:15] right now I want you to get this
[1:28:20] start
[1:28:22] because because this is after after
[1:28:27] Calvary for the lamb had been
[1:28:33] slain that's on this side of the
[1:28:36] cross that he takes the book yes
[1:28:40] somebody help me preach now hold my hold
[1:28:42] your thought because I want you to
[1:28:45] understand friends there is something
[1:28:47] you may look around on earth oh ain't
[1:28:49] nothing going on I tell you God's not
[1:28:51] anywhere listen Heaven has been moved
[1:28:54] yes on our behalf as the lamb steps
[1:28:58] forward to take the book that's right
[1:29:01] what is he doing he is claiming it as a
[1:29:04] man for man to give it back to
[1:29:09] man Hallelujah and I'm telling you
[1:29:12] friends there's a redeemed people on the
[1:29:13] Earth right now that he's handed the
[1:29:16] book
[1:29:17] to because he did not do this for
[1:29:20] himself he was not lost
[1:29:24] he did this for
[1:29:26] [Applause]
[1:29:29] you and it doesn't do any good as long
[1:29:32] as God has it in his hand the titles got
[1:29:34] to come back in man's hand that's right
[1:29:37] Dominion has to come back in man's
[1:29:45] hand there's a call made for a man that
[1:29:48] was
[1:29:49] worthy and a search was made and no man
[1:29:53] was found worth
[1:29:56] Worthy is that right Elijah wasn't
[1:30:00] worthy Moses wasn't
[1:30:03] worthy you look way back over from
[1:30:06] Calvary 2,000 years ago and see great
[1:30:08] man Smith Wigglesworth wasn't worthy FF
[1:30:12] Bosworth wasn't worthy now William
[1:30:13] Brandon wasn't worthy I'm not worthy and
[1:30:15] you wasn't
[1:30:17] worthy no man was found worthy and
[1:30:21] because no man could be found worthy the
[1:30:24] one on the
[1:30:25] throne became a
[1:30:27] [Music]
[1:30:30] man now he stepped forward and
[1:30:33] condescends and pays the requirement of
[1:30:36] death with his own life and raised up
[1:30:40] triumphant over death hell and the grave
[1:30:45] right now yes he's a slam slain lamb and
[1:30:50] it appeared as though he went down and
[1:30:52] defeat you know people figured out how
[1:30:55] can a a man go down in
[1:30:57] death be a
[1:31:00] victory I want you to know he had to
[1:31:03] take flesh to
[1:31:06] death amen for when he died I want you
[1:31:09] to think it appeared as though he went
[1:31:12] down to defeat because when he died pain
[1:31:16] rabbish his body it rattled his senses
[1:31:20] like pain does he grooed in Agony every
[1:31:25] pain and torment of sickness he bore on
[1:31:29] the cross right you say I got a headache
[1:31:33] this morning he had a headache on the
[1:31:36] cross I have a back ache today he had a
[1:31:39] backache on the cross right excruciating
[1:31:44] pain amen you say well I I have a
[1:31:47] sickness and listen he had sickness
[1:31:50] death until he
[1:31:52] died want you to get it he growned in
[1:31:55] agony every pain and torment of sickness
[1:31:59] he bored on the cross that's and in his
[1:32:02] battle at Calvary by death to the flesh
[1:32:05] Jesus tripped Satan of his
[1:32:09] armor he took away from him every
[1:32:15] weapon I'm going to show it to you in
[1:32:17] the Bible First I'm going to show you
[1:32:19] that God that Jesus said Satan has an
[1:32:22] armor so let's go to Luke
[1:32:25] 11:2 but if I with the Finger of God
[1:32:27] cast out Devils no doubt the kingdom of
[1:32:30] God comes to you so he says I'm using
[1:32:34] just a finger of
[1:32:36] God to cast out devils and it's because
[1:32:39] the kingdom of God has come when God's
[1:32:42] Kingdom Come Satan gets cast out right
[1:32:45] amen but if I'm casting out demons
[1:32:49] because of power from from God it proves
[1:32:52] the kingdom of God has has
[1:32:55] arrived see when the strong man armed
[1:32:58] keepeth his Palace his goods are at
[1:33:02] peace but when a stronger than he shall
[1:33:05] come upon him and overcoming he taketh
[1:33:09] from him all his armor in which he
[1:33:10] wherein he trusteed and defile and and
[1:33:14] divideth his spoils so let me let me
[1:33:16] just paraphrase that for you for when
[1:33:19] Satan strong and fully armed guards his
[1:33:22] Palace it's safe until someone
[1:33:28] stronger and better armed attacks and
[1:33:32] overcomes him and strips him of his
[1:33:35] weapons and takes away from him all his
[1:33:40] belongings Hallelujah so when I cast out
[1:33:44] Satan by the Finger of God is because I
[1:33:46] am ex I am exhibiting lordship over
[1:33:50] Satan's kingdom the kingdom of God has
[1:33:54] come the Holy Ghost has come that is the
[1:33:58] kingdom of God somebody help me preach
[1:34:00] amen and when I cast out Devils the
[1:34:03] kingdom of God has come to you I'm
[1:34:06] exhibiting I am I am showing my lordship
[1:34:10] over sickness therefore blind eyes has
[1:34:13] to open deaf ears have to have to come
[1:34:16] open come on am my death is house has to
[1:34:19] give away because I come in as a king
[1:34:22] from another kingdom up greater than
[1:34:24] Satan with more power than Satan he's
[1:34:27] been safe all this time in his house
[1:34:30] with his armor he can do anything he
[1:34:33] wants to mankind but now he's got a
[1:34:35] reckoning
[1:34:37] day now
[1:34:39] somebody stronger than the devil has
[1:34:43] appeared on the scene and that's why
[1:34:45] I've been casting out Devils that's why
[1:34:48] I've been opening the eyes of the blind
[1:34:50] that's why I've been raised of the dead
[1:34:52] that's why I've been exhibiting my
[1:34:54] power but I tell you what I'm fixing to
[1:34:56] do I'm someone stronger and better armed
[1:35:00] and I'm attacking his
[1:35:02] kingdom and I'm going to strip him of
[1:35:06] his weapons and I'm going to carry off
[1:35:08] his
[1:35:09] belongings I'm going to render the devil
[1:35:18] powerless and I want to just tell you
[1:35:21] this is what Jesus did at Calvary punch
[1:35:26] your neighbor and wake up the sleeping
[1:35:28] virgins I'm fixing the
[1:35:31] treats now you see this is what Jesus
[1:35:36] did at Calvary Satan has no legal rights
[1:35:42] that's right he was stripped at Calvary
[1:35:46] yes he now look here Colossians chapter
[1:35:49] 2 verse 13 and you being dead in your
[1:35:52] sins and the uncircumcision of your
[1:35:55] flesh the flesh not being cut off hath
[1:35:57] he made alive together with him having
[1:36:01] forgiven you all
[1:36:04] trespasses right so I put this very
[1:36:06] simply God Made You Alive together with
[1:36:08] Christ having freely forgiven us all our
[1:36:10] sins look at verse 14 blotting out the
[1:36:14] handwriting of ordinance that was
[1:36:16] against us which was contrary to us and
[1:36:20] took it out of the way nailing it to his
[1:36:25] cross so in other words he cancelled the
[1:36:29] charge of our legal
[1:36:32] indead now listen listen we were we were
[1:36:36] in debt we were born that way come on
[1:36:41] but he canceled the record of charges
[1:36:44] against us that condemned us and he took
[1:36:47] it away by nailing it to his
[1:36:50] cross Hallelujah and haven't spoiled
[1:36:54] principalities and Powers he made a show
[1:36:57] of them openly triumphing over them in
[1:37:02] it so now there are many ways the
[1:37:04] translators translate this listen to
[1:37:06] some of them when he disarmed the rulers
[1:37:09] and authorities those Supernatural
[1:37:11] forces of evil operating and fighting
[1:37:14] against us he made a public example of
[1:37:17] them exhibiting them as captives in his
[1:37:20] triumphant possession having Triumph
[1:37:23] over them through the
[1:37:27] cross so in his resurrection he
[1:37:30] triumphed over
[1:37:32] sickness all the agony of pain the
[1:37:36] wounds that's the sickness which he died
[1:37:39] ever cause of
[1:37:41] death amen he triumphed over every
[1:37:44] sickness Rose over death the triumphant
[1:37:48] Christ amen and by doing so he disarmed
[1:37:51] rulers and a ities and he disgraced them
[1:37:55] publicly and he triumphed over them in
[1:37:59] him I want you to know Jesus had
[1:38:03] complete and total victory over the
[1:38:07] devil Hallelujah even to the glorifying
[1:38:10] of his own body Hallelujah won't you be
[1:38:13] glad when you get total Victory to the
[1:38:15] glorifying of your own body amen there
[1:38:18] Jesus defeated all powers every sin
[1:38:22] every sickness every pain that had
[1:38:24] befallen Adam Adam's race all the way
[1:38:27] from the fall of Man and he let the
[1:38:29] whole world see them being led away as
[1:38:32] prisoners when he celebrated his
[1:38:36] victory amen let me read another
[1:38:39] disarming the rulers and Authority he
[1:38:41] had made a Public Disgrace of them
[1:38:44] triumphant over them by the
[1:38:48] cross I like this one he stripped all
[1:38:52] the spiritual tyrants in the universe of
[1:38:56] their sham and pretense Authority at the
[1:38:58] cross and March them naked through the
[1:39:04] streets hallelujah amen totally shaming
[1:39:08] the enemy totally stripping him of his
[1:39:11] power he stripped Satan of his armor he
[1:39:14] unclothed and stripped principalities
[1:39:17] the powers of their armor which by which
[1:39:20] they were clothed and disarming them
[1:39:23] like it's usually done to enemies when
[1:39:25] they fall at the hands of their
[1:39:27] conqueror took away all their powers and
[1:39:29] their authorities and the hosle princes
[1:39:31] and rulers he took off from him took off
[1:39:34] from himself and boldly displayed them
[1:39:37] as His Conquest but when he at by the
[1:39:40] cross triumphed over them having
[1:39:42] stripped the principalities and the
[1:39:44] powers he made us show them openly
[1:39:46] triumphing over them in
[1:39:50] it so let me tell you Satan was rendered
[1:39:55] powerless he was defeated
[1:39:59] completely when Jesus shook off sickness
[1:40:03] and therefore death therefore sickness
[1:40:06] when he sh off death there and his
[1:40:09] resurrection are you with me now there
[1:40:12] in that moment he defeated cancer he
[1:40:16] defeated every dreaded disease every
[1:40:19] crippled condition he defeated sin he
[1:40:23] defeated death itself he defeated
[1:40:27] everything
[1:40:30] everything there was nothing he did not
[1:40:34] defeat I'm telling you this morning all
[1:40:37] sin is defeated all sickness is defeated
[1:40:41] death itself was defeated at
[1:40:44] [Applause]
[1:40:48] Calvary now Satan is
[1:40:50] powerless he once held the power of
[1:40:52] death
[1:40:54] because even the greatest of prophets
[1:40:56] Patriarchs sages could not go in God's
[1:40:59] presence but were held as
[1:41:01] captives in a holding place where
[1:41:04] they're waited for their redeemer to
[1:41:06] come the Bible calls them captives he
[1:41:09] said he led
[1:41:11] captivity captivity the captives now
[1:41:15] notice furthermore Heaven had been
[1:41:18] blocked off from man man could not go
[1:41:22] into heaven
[1:41:24] and he could not bring Heaven
[1:41:26] down now when Adam was here on the earth
[1:41:30] he was a dual nature one he operated in
[1:41:33] the physical we see taste smell feeling
[1:41:36] here just like we do he he had a mind
[1:41:40] with senses reason affection conscience
[1:41:42] all of those
[1:41:43] things but he did not operate the Earth
[1:41:47] from that he controlled the Earth from
[1:41:49] Heaven's
[1:41:50] realm he he operated as a dual nature
[1:41:55] there he lived in heaven while he was on
[1:41:58] the earth and he operated from heaven
[1:42:02] right here on the earth and he brought
[1:42:04] Heaven down and he created a heaven on
[1:42:07] Earth we call it
[1:42:08] Eden amen but now when sin entered in
[1:42:13] heaven was blocked off from man man
[1:42:15] could not go into heaven and he could
[1:42:18] not bring Heaven down and the only way
[1:42:20] from Heaven to come down is for God to
[1:42:23] bring break through the clouds of
[1:42:25] Satan's Darkness because man himself
[1:42:29] could not go into God's
[1:42:32] presence amen who can Ascend into the
[1:42:37] into the hill of God he that has holy
[1:42:39] hands and a clean heart we didn't have
[1:42:43] it come on so you see as brother Bram
[1:42:47] taught us he said over the Earth since
[1:42:49] the Garden of Eden that man was commit
[1:42:52] that sin was committed all Heavens was
[1:42:55] shut off from mankind the domain of this
[1:42:58] Earth was Satan's it belonged to the
[1:43:03] devil Satan is the prince of the power
[1:43:05] of the air and no man could see in the
[1:43:08] glory no man could have True Fellowship
[1:43:11] with God because of the powers of
[1:43:13] Darkness Heaven means the atmospheres
[1:43:15] above and all these Powers shut off
[1:43:18] Heaven's atmosphere from mankind because
[1:43:20] of sin and stormy demon
[1:43:23] clouds of darkness and powers that
[1:43:25] accused wouldn't let God and man
[1:43:28] Fellowship it had been broke since the
[1:43:30] Garden of Eden because of sin but now
[1:43:34] through death through Jesus death to
[1:43:37] mortality by destroying death in his
[1:43:40] flesh by his resurrection to immortality
[1:43:45] and then his Ascension into heaven he
[1:43:48] broke every dark Veil or curtain but
[1:43:53] between God and man the clouds the
[1:43:56] darkness the Hideous Darkness through
[1:44:00] the the Jesus when he ascended remember
[1:44:03] he broke through the veil of sin he tore
[1:44:08] apart the with the high priest's blood
[1:44:10] of his own body and he tore apart the
[1:44:13] veil of sickness that was held over the
[1:44:15] people for he was wounded for our
[1:44:17] transgression and with his trps we were
[1:44:20] healed he went through the great veil of
[1:44:22] worry the great veil of fear he ran
[1:44:25] every Veil into two and he broke every
[1:44:28] Power and he scattered every
[1:44:31] devil
[1:44:33] Hallelujah now this is what he did now I
[1:44:37] want you to understand again he ascended
[1:44:41] as a man into
[1:44:45] heaven want you get the picture now
[1:44:49] where man could not go before
[1:44:53] now he
[1:44:55] ascends through all of these veils of
[1:44:59] darkness and he's piercing the
[1:45:01] clouds moving back to Darkness and he
[1:45:05] becomes the
[1:45:07] channel through which he makes a way for
[1:45:10] all sons of God to be able to approach
[1:45:14] God I'll hold that thought just for a
[1:45:16] minute let's go to Ephesians chapter 4
[1:45:19] and verse 8 let's read this scripture
[1:45:25] wherefore he saith when he ascended on
[1:45:28] high he led captivity captive and he
[1:45:31] gave gifts unto men so he led those who
[1:45:34] were captive held back we call it
[1:45:38] Abraham's bosom amen it was a place of
[1:45:41] waiting for the Redeemer to come right
[1:45:44] and they were not in a glorified
[1:45:46] condition right right I mean when Samuel
[1:45:49] was seen there he was still an old man
[1:45:51] right right he was unchanged he was
[1:45:54] there in a holding place until amen as
[1:45:58] as as as job would say that I will sleep
[1:46:01] until my change comes and so the change
[1:46:05] would come here now where he would lead
[1:46:08] captivity captive and then he said when
[1:46:11] he ascended up he opened up
[1:46:17] channels he opened up channels or he
[1:46:20] gave gifts unto men
[1:46:24] right I want you to see this Gifts of
[1:46:28] his holy spirit through which he would
[1:46:29] Channel His blessings through amen oh
[1:46:34] now verse n now now he that ascended
[1:46:38] what is it but he also descended first
[1:46:42] into the lower parts of the earth now
[1:46:44] let's take a look at this now he
[1:46:47] ascended we got that as he does he lays
[1:46:50] captivity captive amen he gives gifts
[1:46:53] unto men send back gifts makes he makes
[1:46:56] a channel he makes ways for gifts to
[1:46:58] come back to
[1:47:00] men are you with me now that he that
[1:47:03] ascended what is it but he also
[1:47:06] descended
[1:47:08] first into the lower parts of the earth
[1:47:11] I want you to see this in your
[1:47:13] Redemption now this is shown in the
[1:47:16] Bible the Old Testament types just as
[1:47:19] Jesus was the sacrifice he was the lamb
[1:47:22] without blemish kept up and examined and
[1:47:25] so on would be the token and so on like
[1:47:27] that he was also shown in the type of
[1:47:31] the
[1:47:32] scapegoat right right amen now this is
[1:47:37] where the sins of Israel was put upon a
[1:47:42] helpless
[1:47:43] goat a an animal that had done no
[1:47:48] sin come on and all the sins of Israel
[1:47:53] would be taken by the high priest in a
[1:47:57] ceremony and they would take it and put
[1:47:59] it up the head of that
[1:48:02] goat now that's that's who we were we
[1:48:05] were just old goats
[1:48:08] flesh are you with me amen but remember
[1:48:11] a goat is also a clean
[1:48:14] sacrifice and so here here again he's
[1:48:17] represented here in the scapegoat and
[1:48:20] then the the animal would be LED out
[1:48:23] into the Wilderness and left all alone
[1:48:29] right and so was Jesus our
[1:48:34] scapegoat and all the sins of Israel and
[1:48:39] all the sins of the world was put on his
[1:48:42] head and he cries out my
[1:48:45] God my God can't you hear the blading of
[1:48:49] that that animal my God
[1:48:53] why H has Thou forsaken me and he was
[1:48:56] left alone the goat would be left alone
[1:49:00] in the
[1:49:01] wilderness he would be there by
[1:49:05] himself subject to all of the animals of
[1:49:11] prey and there now they would lead this
[1:49:14] goat out a priest would go out with this
[1:49:18] goat lead him out into the Wilderness
[1:49:21] and leave him there alone in by himself
[1:49:24] and the Goat now being left alone I just
[1:49:27] tell you goats are are are are flock
[1:49:29] animals they don't like to be left alone
[1:49:32] they they need a companion and he was
[1:49:34] left alone listen friends he went to
[1:49:37] hell alone that's right right there was
[1:49:40] no Mama went with him no Daddy went with
[1:49:42] him nobody went with him he went alone
[1:49:44] yeah and he was he was there all the
[1:49:48] sins of the world was put on him that's
[1:49:50] right amen and when he screams out my
[1:49:53] God my God why H has Thou forsaken me
[1:49:57] then here come now all the tormentors
[1:50:02] the Wolves the Lions the Predators they
[1:50:05] come and pray pounce on that goat they
[1:50:10] shred him to pieces they destroy him
[1:50:13] every way that he can they tear him they
[1:50:16] rip
[1:50:17] him listen friends you think of Agony at
[1:50:20] the cross but down in hell when he
[1:50:24] ascended down in hell every demon is
[1:50:27] laughing parading around screaming
[1:50:30] yelling obscenities poking at him pring
[1:50:33] him slapping him he's listen he's taking
[1:50:37] your
[1:50:39] punishment he's going there as a sinner
[1:50:42] so you don't have to I preaching to you
[1:50:44] Eve he's taking your punishment your
[1:50:49] abandonment when you should have been
[1:50:51] abandoned when you should have been Cast
[1:50:53] Away he goes alone taking your
[1:50:57] sins down into
[1:51:02] hell now then not only has every pain
[1:51:06] and Agony and death and everything and
[1:51:08] now in the clutches of that down in Hell
[1:51:12] haunting Spirits demons charity him
[1:51:16] afflicts HIM Tears him to pieces and he
[1:51:19] keeps descending and descending and to
[1:51:23] send him till he gets to the bottom of
[1:51:26] the bottomless
[1:51:28] pit to the lowest of Hell dying with
[1:51:33] your
[1:51:35] sins as a condemned
[1:51:43] sinner God condemned
[1:51:48] him he was in hell because of you that's
[1:51:52] right right not because of what he did
[1:51:55] that's right he knew no sin that's he
[1:51:58] had done none of
[1:52:00] this but now all the sins has been
[1:52:04] placed on him and there he there is
[1:52:09] there reaching down to the lowest
[1:52:11] regions of the dam I don't know that it
[1:52:14] has a bottom but however it gets it he
[1:52:16] gets to the lowest region of the
[1:52:20] dam and there there when when he reaches
[1:52:23] the lowest there in three days here he's
[1:52:26] come but there is another
[1:52:30] word hallelujah there is another word
[1:52:34] that is laying there that says I will
[1:52:37] not leave his soul in hell and neither
[1:52:41] will I let my Holy One see
[1:52:44] corruption Hallelujah and brother when
[1:52:47] the time of hell and that part and he
[1:52:51] comes down he surrenders through all all
[1:52:55] of the Demons of hell are pouncing upon
[1:52:58] him and something in a moment begin to
[1:53:04] change this torn bleeding
[1:53:08] lamp begin to
[1:53:10] change and as he changed he became
[1:53:15] triumphant and he goes right into the
[1:53:17] house of Hell
[1:53:19] itself and he snatches away the king
[1:53:22] from Satan to death Hell In The Grave
[1:53:26] hallelujah amen there he eats bits in

[1:54:14] confess that he is ruler Lord of all
[1:54:25] amen something
[1:54:28] changed now he comes up to the region of
[1:54:31] the lost and he
[1:54:34] says can I read it to you the region of
[1:54:38] the dam goes and there he goes in 1
[1:54:41] Peter chter 3: 18 will you read it with
[1:54:44] me 1 Peter
[1:54:48] 318 for Christ also ha once suffer for
[1:54:52] sins the just are the Righteous for the
[1:54:56] unrighteous that he might bring us to
[1:55:00] God being put to death in the flesh but
[1:55:03] Made Alive by the Spirit by which also
[1:55:07] he went and preached unto the spirits in
[1:55:12] prison amen which were sometimes
[1:55:16] Disobedience when Once in the
[1:55:18] longsuffering of God waited in the days
[1:55:20] of Noah while the ark Was preparing
[1:55:22] where in few that is eight Souls were
[1:55:24] saved by water the light figure were un
[1:55:26] to even baptism do save us not putting
[1:55:29] away the filth of the flesh but the
[1:55:31] answer of a good conscience toward God
[1:55:33] by the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:55:36] right so this is exactly why we are
[1:55:38] baptized what do we do we are being
[1:55:40] baptized unto his death not in that the
[1:55:43] water saves us but by us being obedient
[1:55:46] to him amen the putting away the filth
[1:55:48] of flesh is not the answer but the
[1:55:51] answer of a good conscious God by the
[1:55:53] resurrection who is gone into heaven
[1:55:56] what's now what's now who is gone into
[1:55:59] heaven and is on the right hand of God
[1:56:03] angels and authorities and Powers being
[1:56:06] made subject to
[1:56:08] him I want you to get it now when he
[1:56:11] rose every devil every Power every
[1:56:15] Authority every Angel was made subject
[1:56:18] to him he is Lord Over All
[1:56:23] are you with me now so he went there as
[1:56:26] a mighty conqueror he took the keys from
[1:56:29] Satan of death Hell In The Grave he
[1:56:31] stripped Satan of his armor he shook off
[1:56:35] the pain he shook off the agony the
[1:56:37] afflictions the sickness and even death
[1:56:40] itself and he broke the doors of death
[1:56:43] and the Seal of the Tomb and he threw
[1:56:45] off the grave and it rose up conquering
[1:56:48] death itself and then he kept ascending
[1:56:53] I want you to know he kept ascending he
[1:56:56] ascended and broke through the tomb amen
[1:57:00] he comes out of the Tomb but he keeps
[1:57:03] ascending amen he that ascended is also
[1:57:07] the same that ascended up far above all
[1:57:10] Heavens that he might feel all in all so
[1:57:12] he did all of this to become The
[1:57:15] Stairway to Heaven to make a path
[1:57:20] through the sins of man that kept man
[1:57:23] from God's presence he shattered the
[1:57:26] veil of
[1:57:27] sickness he shattered the regions of the
[1:57:30] Shadows of death he scattered the demons
[1:57:34] that had tormented man and held man back
[1:57:36] from God's presence he rendered every
[1:57:39] one of them
[1:57:41] powerless and as he ascended on high he
[1:57:45] gave gifts yes sir to the
[1:57:50] earth and the these gifts would be
[1:57:56] Avenues they would be channels where His
[1:58:00] blessings his word and his Spirit could
[1:58:03] come down to man now God's channel is
[1:58:06] through Ministry gifts which are
[1:58:08] channels through which the word flows so
[1:58:10] watch verse 11 and as he sends these
[1:58:13] gifts he gave some Apostles and some as
[1:58:17] prophets and some as evangelists and
[1:58:20] some as pastors and Su is teaching to do
[1:58:23] what for the perfecting to cause Saints
[1:58:26] to ascend for the perfecting of the
[1:58:30] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[1:58:33] the building up the ascending of the
[1:58:35] body of Christ how long until how long
[1:58:38] will we have these
[1:58:40] gifts amen how long will there be a
[1:58:43] Ministry how long will be they be
[1:58:45] effective how long will God use them how
[1:58:49] long will we need them amen we all come
[1:58:54] in the unity of the faith and the
[1:58:56] knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[1:58:58] perfect man and how under what measure
[1:59:01] under the measure of the stature of the
[1:59:03] fullness of Christ I'm talking about a
[1:59:06] bride ascending
[1:59:08] yes that's right now so Christ is here
[1:59:13] the Holy Spirit the angels of God and
[1:59:16] brother Brams would say I'm merely a
[1:59:18] mouthpiece for him and Moses was just a
[1:59:20] mouthpiece and Jesus was a mouthpiece
[1:59:23] for God and he died to redeem us sinners
[1:59:26] that the program of God might be carried
[1:59:28] on down to the age through the church
[1:59:31] and ministers that are consecrated to
[1:59:33] God become
[1:59:34] channels where God can speak through and
[1:59:37] preach the gospel heal the sick and show
[1:59:40] signs and wonders amen yes sir
[1:59:44] amen now through that golden Avenue the
[1:59:47] grand stairway of Jesus man can now come
[1:59:50] in the presence of God
[1:59:53] I want you to see this let's go to John
[1:59:55] 14 and verse 6 Jesus said unto them I am
[2:00:00] the way the truth and the life no man
[2:00:05] cometh unto the father but by
[2:00:09] me amen you know all this nonsense about
[2:00:13] old the brides now the mediator there's
[2:00:15] one mediator between God and man that's
[2:00:17] the man Christ Jesus that is your only
[2:00:19] approach to God ever
[2:00:25] Jesus said I am the way I am the truth I
[2:00:30] am the life no man cometh to the father
[2:00:35] but by
[2:00:37] me I am the
[2:00:40] stairway the ladder that Jacob saw the
[2:00:45] pathway made in the heaven Where Angels
[2:00:49] can come down that ladder and Ascend
[2:00:53] ascending and descending bringing Heaven
[2:00:57] down to
[2:00:59] earth now I want you to look at this in
[2:01:01] Genesis
[2:01:03] 28:12 Jacob dreamed and behold a ladder
[2:01:07] was set up on the earth and the top of
[2:01:10] it reached to heaven and behold angels
[2:01:12] of God ascending and descending on this
[2:01:18] ladder now Jacob saw it Jacob
[2:01:21] experienced Heaven coming down through a
[2:01:23] way a Stairway a ladder but Jacob was a
[2:01:27] sinful
[2:01:28] man and it could not be anchored or made
[2:01:31] P permanent in
[2:01:34] Jacob amen but God said there will be a
[2:01:38] stone that I will lay in Zion it will be
[2:01:41] a precious stone it will be a tried
[2:01:43] Stone it'll be someone I can anchor to
[2:01:47] and he will be the way or the entrance
[2:01:49] into Heaven's life and Heaven's power
[2:01:53] amen and in heaven the ladder is hooked
[2:01:56] to the heart of God but now on Earth in
[2:02:00] Christ Jesus God had a place to Anchor
[2:02:03] it and because Jesus was the chief
[2:02:07] Corner
[2:02:09] Stone Hallelujah so he hooked it into
[2:02:12] Christ and there it anchored and there's
[2:02:14] no slipping there's no sliding there's
[2:02:17] no removing of the way if it was the way
[2:02:19] yesterday it's the way today if it was
[2:02:22] the way 2,000 years ago it's the way
[2:02:25] today amen what is it hooked back to God
[2:02:28] above by the Son of God beneath it's the
[2:02:32] pathway the Traveler's way from Heaven
[2:02:34] to glory and you can't
[2:02:37] fail amen come on Amen the Bible said
[2:02:41] even a fool won't
[2:02:44] air amen you get on this way not even a
[2:02:47] fool Will air amen listen it's it is
[2:02:51] there where great companies of angels
[2:02:54] they ascend and descend picking up the
[2:02:56] weary picking up the sick healing their
[2:02:59] bodies showing Visions bringing signs
[2:03:01] and wonders it can't fail it can't slip
[2:03:04] it can't slide you're
[2:03:06] safe there's a way
[2:03:09] made direct to the
[2:03:15] throne it's there now so what are you
[2:03:19] scared about you see our PR is hooked
[2:03:22] between God and Christ and we're in
[2:03:24] between there Angels ascending and
[2:03:25] descending and all the trials of Life
[2:03:28] climbing higher and higher East day East
[2:03:29] Day brings us one realm higher amen
[2:03:33] higher as we move up and up that's what
[2:03:35] I keep trying to tell you you know keep
[2:03:37] taking another step keep moving on
[2:03:39] higher keep ascending if I follow along
[2:03:42] the road or something happens to me
[2:03:44] there's a great host of Angels standing
[2:03:46] there to pick me up amen we're marching
[2:03:48] toward Zion toward that beautiful city
[2:03:51] of God now Jesus is the
[2:03:56] way now Philip having met Jesus he went
[2:04:00] and told Nathaniel that he had found the
[2:04:03] Messiah it was Jesus of Nazareth and and
[2:04:07] of course Nathaniel protested you know
[2:04:09] how can anything good come out of nazus
[2:04:12] well Philip just said we'll come and see
[2:04:14] so he gets in the presence of Jesus and
[2:04:16] Nathaniel comeing you know as he
[2:04:19] approached John 147 he saw Nathaniel
[2:04:23] coming to him and said behold an Israel
[2:04:26] in whom there's no God here's an honest
[2:04:29] Israelite here's a man that's really
[2:04:31] honest at heart verse 48 said Nathaniel
[2:04:33] said to him when did you know me Philip
[2:04:37] Jesus answered and said before that
[2:04:38] Philip called thee when thou was under
[2:04:41] the vict tree I saw thee
[2:04:44] John and and look look he said Nathaniel
[2:04:48] answered and said unto him Rabbi Thou
[2:04:50] Art the son of God D the king of Israel
[2:04:53] and Jesus answered and said to them
[2:04:55] because I said un Thee I saw thee under
[2:04:58] the vict Tre believest thou Thou shalt
[2:05:01] see greater things than
[2:05:07] this now notice here Thou shalt see
[2:05:11] greater things than this cuz you
[2:05:14] believed because I saw you under the
[2:05:17] Victory and you believed H you know
[2:05:19] you're going to see greater things than
[2:05:21] this if you're able to see that I'm I'm
[2:05:23] the Son of God if you're able to see if
[2:05:26] you are able to see if you can recognize
[2:05:28] me being
[2:05:30] king of Israel then that puts you in a
[2:05:33] position where you're going to see
[2:05:34] greater things you see you'll never see
[2:05:38] the great things of God until first you
[2:05:40] see him as Lord of your life
[2:05:44] King are you with me and when you see
[2:05:48] that that I'm the connection between
[2:05:51] Heaven and Earth then verse 51 says and
[2:05:54] he said unto him verely verely I say to
[2:05:56] you Hereafter ye shall see Heavens open
[2:06:01] and the angels of God ascended and
[2:06:03] descended on the son of man if you can
[2:06:06] see if you can understand if you can
[2:06:09] receive that I the
[2:06:11] king if you can receive it that that I
[2:06:15] am the Son of God if you can receive
[2:06:18] this then you're going to see also
[2:06:21] Heaven open
[2:06:22] yes and you will see that when Heaven's
[2:06:24] open you'll see the angels of God
[2:06:27] ascending and descending on the son of
[2:06:30] man you will see that I am the
[2:06:34] ladder through which the channel through
[2:06:38] which the blessings
[2:06:41] flow now if we could only get in our
[2:06:45] position to recognize
[2:06:48] him then we'll see healing take place in
[2:06:50] our bodies
[2:06:52] when we then we see Joy come and we'll
[2:06:54] see great things happen you see just get
[2:06:57] in a position to recognize him who he is
[2:07:00] it's why we're preaching what we're
[2:07:02] preaching today want you to recognize
[2:07:05] want you to recognize Satan has no legal
[2:07:11] rights he is
[2:07:13] stripped completely
[2:07:17] powerless
[2:07:19] now now of course
[2:07:22] then once you recognize you get in that
[2:07:25] position of seeing him as Lord as the
[2:07:28] ruler of your life then in that position
[2:07:33] angels can then Ascend and descend upon
[2:07:35] the sons of man so there on the day of
[2:07:38] Pentecost when 120 recognized him as
[2:07:42] more than a man but as the Son of God
[2:07:45] the king and they received of his
[2:07:47] lordship as Peter held the keys to the
[2:07:50] door of the Kingdom by repentance and
[2:07:54] being baptized in his name and accepting
[2:07:57] the remission of sins and that open the
[2:08:00] door to the stairway where the Holy
[2:08:04] Ghost could
[2:08:06] descend are you with me church amen so
[2:08:10] there through the way the stairway the
[2:08:12] ladder the Holy Ghost uh descended and
[2:08:15] Heaven came down now to live in
[2:08:19] man Hallelujah just bring Heaven around
[2:08:22] you but bring Heaven in you you see this
[2:08:26] is exactly where it must start the
[2:08:29] kingdom doesn't start restoring the
[2:08:31] Earth the kingdom doesn't start even
[2:08:33] restoring your flesh to Perfection the
[2:08:36] kingdom starts in the heart of man and
[2:08:39] when God restores your heart and he
[2:08:42] becomes king of your life that's right
[2:08:45] there he exalts you and sunship and he
[2:08:48] makes a ladder between you and Christ
[2:08:51] pris is in your heart amen and there the
[2:08:54] blessings flow and Heaven comes down to
[2:08:57] live in you Hallelujah and you are
[2:09:00] living then in Heavenly places in the
[2:09:02] believer's position in Christ Jesus with
[2:09:06] every devil under your feet triumphant

[2:09:13] Overcomers now see you see you see
[2:09:17] through the way through the stairway
[2:09:20] opened up
[2:09:22] Heaven came down to live in man the king
[2:09:25] and the kingdom was now within
[2:09:29] them Peter at the gate called Beautiful
[2:09:32] showed Kingdom authority of a son who is
[2:09:35] placed in position of sunship given by
[2:09:39] father by the father you know Jesus
[2:09:41] wasn't no longer there to
[2:09:43] heal right amen he had ascended into
[2:09:47] Glory but now he's got a representative
[2:09:50] on Earth
[2:09:52] amen he's got a place he's got a channel
[2:09:54] through which Heaven can come which the
[2:09:57] Holy Ghost can move and listen he don't
[2:10:00] just get the Holy Ghost so he can jump
[2:10:01] and scream and shout but no he does it
[2:10:05] even more than this he does this in
[2:10:07] order to control to cast Satan out I
[2:10:12] want you to understand Peter at the gate
[2:10:13] called Beautiful showed Kingdom
[2:10:16] authority of a son who is placed in a
