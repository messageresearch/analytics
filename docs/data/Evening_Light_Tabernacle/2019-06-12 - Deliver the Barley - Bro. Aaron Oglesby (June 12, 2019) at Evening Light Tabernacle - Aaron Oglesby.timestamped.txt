[20:48] you go with me tonight in prayer
[20:51] Heavenly Father once again we come
[20:54] before your throne Lord God and
[20:55] recognize our need of you lord I need
[20:58] you to come tonight and take control of
[20:59] this service I need you to come take
[21:01] control of this body these lips Lord for
[21:04] truly there's nothing I can say Lord in
[21:05] my own lord and my own knowledge my own
[21:07] ability that in any way you could
[21:09] benefit these people but Lord if you'll
[21:11] come and speak Lord and you'll open the
[21:12] bread of life Lord God and you allow
[21:14] people to recognize who they are where
[21:16] we are Lord Jesus Lord of your people
[21:19] Lord God could just be lifted up tonight
[21:20] to to grab a hold of another another
[21:23] portion of faith Lord to be elevated in
[21:25] the promise well that's what we want
[21:27] tonight we want you to speak to the
[21:28] people Lord that's the only way that can
[21:30] happen is if you'll come take control
[21:32] but I submit myself to you submit this
[21:34] service to you we thank you for the
[21:36] worship Lord that's gone forth I pray
[21:38] that it was pleasing in your eyes Lord
[21:40] not just pray you'll come now take
[21:42] control in Jesus name Amen amen if
[21:46] you'll turn with me to Deuteronomy the
[21:48] eighth chapter we'll look in the seventh
[21:51] verse and then we'll also look at we're
[21:55] in 2nd Samuel the 23rd chapter after we
[21:57] read here
[22:07] I want to speak to you tonight for a
[22:11] little while on the subject of deliver
[22:13] the barley deliver the barley I our
[22:18] thing tonight is that we want to
[22:20] recognize that that Satan's job is to
[22:23] rob you
[22:24] Satan's job is to keep you from
[22:26] attaining all that belongs to you and
[22:28] the thing is he doesn't come in and say
[22:31] oh look at me I'm the devil and go after
[22:33] all the big things right off the bat
[22:35] what Satan does is he comes in and he
[22:38] begins to nibble and he comes in slyly
[22:40] in ways that we never expect but if we
[22:43] can recognize him in those moments and
[22:45] we can deal with him in those moments
[22:46] when it's still a little thing then we
[22:48] can have much greater victory in our
[22:50] life instead of allowing it to grow into
[22:53] it to a major issue something that's
[22:55] deep rooted in our heart our deep rooted
[22:57] in our home and then it becomes a much
[22:59] bigger issue for us to deal with so
[23:02] tonight we want to recognize the devil
[23:03] recognize his tricks recognize his lies
[23:05] and always remember that the promises of
[23:07] God are yay and amen verse 7 it says for
[23:11] the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a
[23:14] good land a land of Brooks of water of
[23:16] fountains and depths that spring out of
[23:18] the valleys and Hills a land of wheat
[23:21] and barley and vines and fig trees and
[23:24] promote pomegranates a land of olive oil
[23:27] and honey a land wherein thou shalt eat
[23:30] bread without scare sness thou shalt not
[23:32] lack anything in it a land whose stones
[23:35] are iron and out of whose hills thou
[23:37] mayest dig brass when thou has eaten and
[23:41] art full then thou shalt bless the LORD
[23:44] thy God for the good land which he hath
[23:47] given there we'll turn over now to 2nd
[23:49] Samuel the 23rd chapter in the eighth
[23:51] verse and in verse 8 it says these be
[24:02] the names of the mighty men whom David
[24:04] had the tech my night that said in the
[24:07] seat
[24:07] chief among the captains the same was
[24:10] with adeno that is right he lifts up his
[24:12] spear against eight hundred whom he slew
[24:15] at one time and after him was le easier
[24:19] the son of dodo
[24:20] via Hawaii one of the three mighty men
[24:23] with David when they defied the
[24:25] Philistines that were there gathered
[24:27] together to battle and the men of Israel
[24:30] were gone away he arose and smote the
[24:34] Philistines until his hand was weary and
[24:36] his hand clayvin to the sword and the
[24:38] Lord wrought a great victory that day
[24:40] and the people returned after him only
[24:43] to spoil may the Lord bless the reading
[24:47] of the word you may have your seats
[24:50] what a wonderful description we read
[24:52] there in the book of Deuteronomy of the
[24:54] land that the Israelites had been taken
[24:56] to is a land full of the goodness of God
[24:59] a land that that was full of wheat a
[25:01] land that was full of barley a land that
[25:03] had vines and plenty of bread and
[25:05] running water and Springs and it was a
[25:08] land that lacked nothing I believe
[25:10] tonight that we can say that we've been
[25:12] brought to a land and it's and it's a
[25:14] good land and and it says you shall lack
[25:16] nothing in this land and the Lord had
[25:18] brought them up out of Egypt and he'd
[25:20] brought them up with the mighty hand and
[25:21] in so doing he had showed the miraculous
[25:24] he had showed signs and wonders he had
[25:27] showed that there was no other God that
[25:29] could stand before this God he had
[25:31] showed that there was no situation that
[25:33] could stand in front of him there was no
[25:35] army that could stand in front of him
[25:37] when God makes up his mind he's going to
[25:39] do something the work is finished it
[25:41] doesn't matter what the devil tries to
[25:42] do it doesn't matter what he throws in
[25:44] your way if you'll stay with the Lord
[25:46] you're gonna overcome and there was no
[25:50] army that could stand there and as long
[25:51] as Israel would stay with the Lord they
[25:53] could say who can stand before us it
[25:57] wasn't just who can stand before our God
[25:58] because as long as they were walking
[26:00] with Him then they could say who can
[26:02] stand before us because he was walking
[26:05] with them and I believe that tonight we
[26:07] can ask that same question who can stand
[26:10] before our God can cancer stand before
[26:13] our God can depression stand before our
[26:15] God what about anxiety can it stand
[26:18] before our God we can say that even in
[26:19] this congregation we've seen all those
[26:21] things defeated we would be here all
[26:23] night if we all had the opportunity to
[26:25] testify about the times that God has
[26:27] overcome has defeated the enemy has
[26:29] lifted us up when we were down as
[26:31] this joy when we were depressed who has
[26:33] healed our body when we were sick there
[26:35] is nothing that can stand before our God
[26:37] and as long as we were walking with the
[26:39] word we're walking in the promise we
[26:41] therefore can say tonight what can stand
[26:43] before us as even in light tabernacle as
[26:46] members of the bride of Jesus Christ
[26:47] what can stand before said God be for us
[26:50] who can be against us tonight amen all
[26:53] these things have been defeated
[26:55] therefore we know that that that we are
[26:57] on the path to receiving all that God
[27:00] has promised for us now Israel had seen
[27:02] the miraculous hand of God delivered
[27:04] them and take them to the promised land
[27:06] and it was a physical land it was a
[27:08] physical place that they had been
[27:09] promised and as the scripture said there
[27:11] it had wheat and barley and figs and
[27:13] honey and it was a good land but we also
[27:15] have been returned to a land that's the
[27:18] land of the Holy Ghost and here in this
[27:20] land is full of living waters here in
[27:22] this land is full of powers full of
[27:24] healing is full of salvation this land
[27:26] tonight is full of deliverance is full
[27:28] of everything that you have need of
[27:30] tonight but you got to stay in the land
[27:32] there's deliverance for you there's
[27:34] peace for you it is a good land but I
[27:37] also want to tell you tonight that in
[27:39] the land there's war in this land there
[27:43] is conflict when Israel came into the
[27:45] land the first time you know God didn't
[27:48] come down and just remove all the
[27:49] Hittites and the jebusites and all the
[27:51] other rights and go ok I've cleaned them
[27:53] all out for you now now you go in and
[27:55] possess all they had but what they had
[27:57] to do is they had to go in and fight for
[27:59] every single inch of the land they had
[28:01] to go in and they had to battle and they
[28:03] had to battle constantly and then you
[28:04] come down into modern times after World
[28:06] War two and after the Holocaust and they
[28:08] were brought back to the land once again
[28:11] and they have had to fight every single
[28:12] day for their very existence they have
[28:15] had to guard their borders against
[28:16] attack they have to watch out as the
[28:19] Arab world has sworn to destroy them and
[28:21] they have to constantly be on the
[28:22] lookout for missile attacks and car
[28:24] bombs and suicide bombers it's a
[28:27] constant battle for them to stay in the
[28:30] land the the world politicians have
[28:32] turned against them and there's no one
[28:34] standing left standing there with them
[28:36] anymore except some Christians and some
[28:38] people in America I would say that if we
[28:40] got right down to it even America has
[28:42] turned away from them and not support
[28:44] them the way that
[28:45] we once did but they in their situation
[28:48] in their country they cannot allow the
[28:50] enemy to have even one little bitty bit
[28:53] of ground they can't allow even a small
[28:57] attack it doesn't have to be a large
[28:59] attack it doesn't have to be a full-on
[29:00] scale war they cannot allow him any
[29:03] entry into their land if they recognize
[29:06] any little attack they immediately go
[29:08] they go on the offensive and they end
[29:10] that attack as quick as they possibly
[29:12] can because if if it's in their land
[29:15] even one foot they are determined we're
[29:17] going to keep the enemy out of our
[29:19] promised land so they are a people of
[29:22] the land and now they must fight to stay
[29:24] in the land to keep the enemy off their
[29:26] land and to keep the enemy from taking
[29:29] what is theirs and I say that tonight we
[29:32] are in a good land but we stand in the
[29:34] exact same place that the Israelites
[29:36] stand we must have our guard up at all
[29:38] times we cannot give even a little bit
[29:40] of ground
[29:40] we cannot lay down our weapons even for
[29:43] a minute because the enemy is always
[29:44] looking for a way in the enemy is always
[29:47] looking for a way to attack you must
[29:49] stay on guard and not give up even an
[29:51] inch even a little parcel of ground no
[29:53] matter how insignificant that parcel of
[29:55] ground may seem this is a land filled
[29:58] with promises but you're going to have
[30:00] to fight for it every single day brother
[30:03] branham would say and now after you're
[30:05] in that don't mean that you're out free
[30:07] from war you still have to fight for
[30:10] every inch of ground that you stand on
[30:12] brother footprints his possession
[30:15] ministering brother don't be afraid to
[30:17] put footprints where God has told you to
[30:19] go his possession he told Joshua
[30:22] everywhere the soles of your feet scent
[30:24] that's yours we don't back up we don't
[30:26] take what God said and that's we take
[30:29] what God said that's the truth no matter
[30:30] what the opposition says how great it
[30:33] seems how difficult it seems if God said
[30:36] so it's yours tonight when he gave it to
[30:39] Joshua he never said I'll take all the
[30:40] Hittites and Philistines and give it to
[30:42] you Joshua had to fight every inch of
[30:45] ground but God was with him and every
[30:48] inch of ground you'll cover brother to
[30:50] make footprints you'll fight your way
[30:52] through but take the sword of the Spirit
[30:55] brother
[30:55] and move right on I love how it doesn't
[30:57] just tell you to go fight but he equips
[30:59] you for the battle he doesn't just tell
[31:01] you to go kick him out but he gives you
[31:03] the tools necessary in order for you to
[31:05] go do it he says take the sword of the
[31:07] Spirit and go forward
[31:09] brother Brown says here oh my I like
[31:11] that the believers promise you say
[31:14] what's that got to do with us to every
[31:17] believer the believers promises eternal
[31:20] life the believers promises life joy
[31:23] peace long-suffering gentleness patience
[31:26] fruits of the spirit divine healing
[31:28] dozens of things I got wrote down here
[31:30] nearly that's all your possession it
[31:33] belongs to you but you can't have it
[31:35] until you fight for it I'll tell you the
[31:38] word we've been given is a good word
[31:39] it's full of everything you have need of
[31:41] to overcome and Laodicea it's got
[31:44] everything you have needed to take a
[31:45] rapture in this last day but you're
[31:47] gonna have to be willing to fight for it
[31:49] but if you fight you will overcome that
[31:52] is your promise tonight brother Branham
[31:55] says that's what's the matter with the
[31:57] church tonight we got a wishbone instead
[31:59] of a backbone what we need is something
[32:02] in there that'll stand you up amen
[32:05] every man that ever amounted to a hill
[32:07] of beans had to fight for what he got
[32:10] God don't give it to you on a silver
[32:13] platter God doesn't give it to you on a
[32:26] silver platter but I believe tonight
[32:30] that this land that this word that we be
[32:32] given is worth fighting for
[32:33] I believe what we've been given is worth
[32:35] standing up for it's worth giving our
[32:37] life for it's worth standing and when no
[32:39] one else will stand when all everyone
[32:41] else runs away when people are letting
[32:43] down standards
[32:44] I believe this word is worth fighting
[32:45] for I believe there's things in there
[32:47] that you can't get anywhere else we'll
[32:49] fight for so many other things and we'll
[32:51] stand up for so many other things but
[32:53] what about the word that's being
[32:54] trampled in this day somebody's going to
[32:56] be a beacon somebody's going to be a
[32:58] lighthouse and say this is the truth
[32:59] we're standing on
[33:01] we're not going to go this way or that
[33:02] way with new doctrines and new ideas
[33:04] we're going to say exactly what the
[33:06] Prophet said because that's what we need
[33:08] to take a rapture this word is worth
[33:10] fighting for and sometimes it may not
[33:13] just be fighting against worldly ideas
[33:15] it may be fighting against ideas that
[33:16] rise up in the message but I'm willing
[33:18] to stand tonight and fight for the truth
[33:21] and fight for the Holy Spirit still
[33:23] being in our services fight for the Holy
[33:25] Spirit for our young people fight for
[33:27] the Holy Spirit in our homes it's worth
[33:29] fighting for tonight because it's life
[33:31] without it as nothing but death but with
[33:34] the Holy Spirit there's life and it's
[33:36] worth fighting for tonight it's a good
[33:39] land and we must have the same resolve
[33:42] that we see in Israel they're determined
[33:46] that there will never be another
[33:47] Holocaust never again will they stand by
[33:51] and watch the enemy come in and take
[33:53] their land take their lives and we must
[33:56] stand right there where they stand and
[33:57] say never again will we stand by and
[33:59] watch our promises be taken never again
[34:01] will we stand by watch our children be
[34:03] drug out into the world never again will
[34:05] we stand by while our homes are broken
[34:07] up and destroyed never again will we sit
[34:09] by and let people tell us that that was
[34:11] for a bygone day in a bygone era but
[34:14] this is for this day this is for this
[34:15] heir the Holy Spirit is for right now
[34:17] that healing of the body is for right
[34:19] now the Pentecostal promise the
[34:22] Pentecostal blessing is for right now
[34:23] it's not for a day gone by it's for this
[34:26] day because we've been turned back to
[34:28] that day once again it's worth fighting
[34:30] for tonight Church but it's going to
[34:34] take men and women with backbone who are
[34:36] willing to fight men who will say this
[34:39] will not happen on my watch men who will
[34:43] say truth will be preached righteousness
[34:45] will be upheld holiness will be exalted
[34:48] Healing will be proclaimed we will not
[34:51] sit by idly and let the devil in not on
[34:55] our watch it's going to be a fight as
[35:04] long as we're here on this earth in
[35:05] these bodies Satan's desires to rob you
[35:08] of everything that Christ has given you
[35:11] and he's gonna fight you until the day
[35:13] that you leave here he's he's constantly
[35:15] looking for a way to get into your life
[35:17] he studied mankind he has studied you
[35:20] it's been said before he knows us better
[35:22] than we know ourselves he knows our
[35:24] every weakness that's why when we
[35:26] recognize a weakness in our life we must
[35:27] keep it covered we must keep those
[35:29] things under the blood he's always
[35:31] studying ways to get inside the borders
[35:33] of your promise to attack you in a nun
[35:36] fortified position or to catch you out
[35:38] from behind the word like he did Eve or
[35:41] to catch you in a situation a neglectful
[35:43] time like he did the disciples when they
[35:45] left out on the boat and they left Jesus
[35:46] behind and he he saw his opportunity to
[35:49] take the life of the disciples because
[35:51] they went out and did something without
[35:52] Jesus they went out on their own without
[35:55] Jesus in their boat and the reason he's
[35:57] doing all this is he's looking for his
[35:59] opportunity to destroy you sometimes I
[36:01] think we don't recognize how evil the
[36:04] devil is because we think maybe he's
[36:06] just trying to take this from me and
[36:07] he's trying to take that from me what
[36:09] you have to understand is those are all
[36:10] just little pieces that he's trying to
[36:12] take his end goal was to destroy you to
[36:15] utterly tear you down to bring you down
[36:17] to the depths of despair he hates you he
[36:19] is not your friend there's no reason to
[36:21] bargain with the enemy there's no reason
[36:23] to make treaties with the enemy he has
[36:25] no desire to be your friend his one goal
[36:27] is to destroy you and to make sure you
[36:30] don't go in a rapture but I got bad news
[36:32] for the old devil tonight I've already
[36:34] read the back of the book and we win I
[36:37] got bad news for the devil tonight
[36:39] there's already been a word proclaimed
[36:40] over youth there's already been a
[36:41] prophecy poured out over you there's
[36:43] already been an anointing oil poured out
[36:45] over youth Goliath pin I killed you
[36:47] you've already been anointed you're
[36:49] already been seen in the vision going in
[36:51] a rapture he can't not destroy you all
[36:54] we have to do is stand on the promise
[36:56] stand on the word and trust in it and
[36:58] not back up not give in but take the
[37:01] sword of the Spirit and go forward
[37:03] tonight it's all laying in the land for
[37:05] you if you'll go and possess it this is
[37:13] why we must put on the whole armor of
[37:14] God because he's always looking for any
[37:17] little crack in our armor and we must
[37:19] give him no place I'm going to say that
[37:22] a lot tonight we must give him no place
[37:25] no opportunity with no opportunities to
[37:27] run around or work in our lives and too
[37:30] many times we ourselves are to blame for
[37:33] the situations that we're dealing with
[37:35] why do you say that because we let him
[37:37] stay on our land when we didn't have to
[37:40] what we have to recognize tonight is is
[37:43] that it's our job it's our
[37:45] responsibility to take the word of the
[37:47] Lord you can't just sit back and and say
[37:49] well the Lord's gonna take care of that
[37:51] for me know the Lord has placed it in
[37:52] your hands he's given you a job to do
[37:54] he's given you the responsibility to
[37:56] take the word of the Lord and drive the
[37:58] enemy off every one of your promises
[38:00] drive the enemy off your land but too
[38:02] many times we sit back and we allow him
[38:04] free rein in our promises that he has
[38:07] absolutely no rights to we give him a
[38:09] place to stand and he doesn't belong in
[38:11] our land because there was a time where
[38:13] he had those rights because of the the
[38:15] fall of Adams race but what we know is
[38:17] that at Calvary all that Adam lost Jesus
[38:20] Christ restored to you every redemptive
[38:22] blessing that was ever given is now
[38:24] given back to you because of what Jesus
[38:26] Christ did at Calvary
[38:27] Satan has no rights to your land he has
[38:30] no rights to your health he has no
[38:31] rights to your family he has no right to
[38:33] your joy he has no rights to anything
[38:35] that God has given you too many times we
[38:38] let him Bluff up us this is how we stand
[38:40] up in his face and say get off my land
[38:43] get off my property
[38:44] take your depression take your anxiety
[38:47] take
[38:47] lines spirits and get out of here and do
[38:50] it with the word of the Lord sometimes
[38:52] we need to stand up and remind him that
[38:54] he doesn't even have the keys to his own
[38:55] house they were stripped from him by
[38:57] Jesus Christ much less does he have the
[39:00] right to come into my home tear up my
[39:02] home and do things in my house he
[39:04] doesn't even have the authority to go in
[39:06] his own house Jesus took the keys from
[39:09] him so many times the things that we're
[39:11] going through is because we've allowed
[39:12] him when he has no rights whatsoever
[39:16] ever right he ever had was stripped from
[39:19] him by our Lord Jesus and given to you
[39:24] therefore he has no right in your land
[39:27] it doesn't matter where he is what part
[39:30] of the land even if he's just on the
[39:33] outskirts see that's the thing is
[39:36] sometimes we look at him we go well that
[39:38] this really isn't bothering me much and
[39:42] he says he's over there he's over there
[39:44] but if he's on your land he's
[39:46] trespassing I don't care what part of
[39:49] your land is owned he doesn't have a
[39:51] right to be there and the problem is the
[39:53] longer you allow him to stay there the
[39:55] next day he'll move a little closer and
[39:57] the next day he'll move a little closer
[39:58] until you wake up one day and he's way
[40:01] too close for comfort now you've got
[40:02] real problems on your hand when you
[40:04] could have dealt with him when he first
[40:06] stepped on your property way over there
[40:08] why let him get close to our home why
[40:10] let him come in and bring danger to your
[40:12] family why bring him into your living
[40:13] room and bring danger to your children
[40:15] why let those things get close when you
[40:17] have the right and the opportunity and
[40:18] the authority the minute you seen begin
[40:21] to creep in say take your lying self and
[40:23] get off my property you have the right
[40:26] to call the authority the Holy Spirit on
[40:28] him and he will arrest him and take him
[40:31] out because he cannot stay if you will
[40:34] tell him to go don't dismiss the issue
[40:38] and that like nothing's happening
[40:41] don't wait till he's in your house don't
[40:43] wait until he's too close for you to do
[40:46] anything about it it would do wonders
[40:49] tonight for your children if they could
[40:51] see daddy rise up and do battle with the
[40:53] devil it would do wonders tonight for
[40:57] your marriage if your spouse could see
[40:58] you go to war for that
[41:00] you made it would do wonders for your
[41:02] home if they could see you raise up and
[41:04] be a leader in the home like you're
[41:06] supposed to be and have a backbone and
[41:07] stand up against some of those things
[41:08] that's been trying to come into your
[41:10] home stand up against the make up stand
[41:12] up against the tight clothes it would do
[41:14] wonders for them to see their daddy from
[41:16] once get down on his knees and restore
[41:17] the family altar and begin to invite the
[41:20] Holy Spirit back in it would do wonders
[41:22] for the experience in your home to see
[41:24] you stand up against the Goliath and
[41:26] slay him instead of letting that thing
[41:28] rule over you it's kind of hard to tell
[41:30] your children how they need to live how
[41:32] they need to overcome God send a prophet
[41:34] you're walking around beat down defeated
[41:36] every day with the Goliath and they're
[41:38] boasting and telling you what you are
[41:40] gonna do it ain't gonna do Rod's up one
[41:42] time gentler Kalani has no rights over
[41:45] you tell Goliath he was born for one
[41:47] reason that was for you to kill Goliath
[41:49] was born for one reason and that was to
[41:51] die Goliath was born to die like a lot
[41:54] for many of you was born for one reason
[41:56] for you to take his head off that would
[41:59] do wonders for your family to see the
[42:02] parents raise up and take the position
[42:04] they're supposed to be in brother Brown
[42:07] says brother I'm telling it sent the
[42:10] rock to the killing place and down went
[42:12] Goliath you know what happened then the
[42:15] Israelites took courage in a way they
[42:18] went
[42:18] they cut Philistines plumb to the walls
[42:20] it just takes one person that's got
[42:23] enough courage to step out and say it's
[42:25] right God said so now listen to this
[42:28] brother you down a Goliath and your
[42:31] whole family will go to cut and Phyllis
[42:33] things the first thing you know you kill
[42:35] look alive tonight and watch what
[42:37] happens in your family you kill look
[42:38] alive tomorrow and watch what happens
[42:40] with your family it's gonna be a bloody
[42:42] mess because they're gonna go to cutting
[42:44] Philistines here and cut Philistine
[42:46] cleaning out clothes is here cleaning
[42:48] out cosmetics there cleaning out bad
[42:50] news at bad movies bad video games
[42:52] they'll be out cleaning out that happens
[42:54] if you take care of the glass that are
[42:56] in your life it starts with the head of
[42:59] the home too many things are in the home
[43:03] because we won't deal with it when it's
[43:04] little what we have to do is quit
[43:08] deciding that some things are a big deal
[43:10] and that some things aren't a big deal
[43:13] let's simplify if this is in the word
[43:16] good or bad it's a big deal okay if it's
[43:20] in the word you know the Lord didn't go
[43:22] you know what I need something else on
[43:24] this page that's only half a page I got
[43:27] it I got to fill it up with something
[43:28] one of you angels come here will you
[43:29] fill this page yet that's not how it
[43:31] work it fits in the word whether it's
[43:34] for your good or it's something about
[43:36] the devil that's not it's a big deal so
[43:39] we got to quit looking at things and
[43:40] going where oh I mean it's okay my kid
[43:42] that's not that big a deal don't say
[43:43] it's not a big deal if the Lord it in
[43:45] his word it's a big deal if he cares
[43:47] about the way we should dress then that
[43:49] so that's a big deal that's something we
[43:51] should pay attention to if he says you
[43:53] know that women should have long hair
[43:55] that's a big deal in women should and
[43:57] men should have short hair that's a big
[43:58] deal he wouldn't have put it in the word
[44:00] if he says that you have must be born
[44:03] again listen to me that's a big deal
[44:05] it's not just I believe the message I
[44:08] believe the message no sir you've got to
[44:09] have an experience with the Living God
[44:11] he said you must be born again it's a
[44:15] big deal
[44:16] you must have an experience with God if
[44:21] it's in the word it's a big deal you
[44:22] know there's an old saying that says
[44:24] well you need to choose your battles not
[44:28] with the devil no no we don't pick and
[44:32] choose our about you know what I don't
[44:33] want to fight this battle because that's
[44:34] gonna stir up the home and she's gonna
[44:36] get really mad at me so this is just a
[44:38] little thing so I'm gonna let that go no
[44:41] that's not how it works when it comes to
[44:43] Satan and him setting the foot on my
[44:45] property him setting the foot on my
[44:47] promise him sitting the foot anywhere
[44:49] inside my land anywhere near my family
[44:51] anywhere near my children I'm not gonna
[44:54] pick and choose my battles if he steps
[44:56] on my promise we're going to
[44:57] if he steps on my promise we're fencing
[44:59] to have a fight right then right there
[45:01] and I can already tell you who's gonna
[45:03] win I can already tell you who's going
[45:05] to overcome I am because I'm walking
[45:07] with the Lord Jesus Christ and if our
[45:09] God is for us who can stand against us I
[45:12] know that when I go to war with with the
[45:14] enemy I'm going to come out victorious
[45:16] because I have a promise I've been given
[45:18] a book full of promises and every single
[45:21] one of them are the truth he can't rob
[45:23] me out of any of them unless I let him
[45:28] you say but it's just a little thing and
[45:34] really it's not bothering me it stays
[45:36] out there on the edge of my promise Song
[45:40] of Solomon tells us it's the little
[45:41] foxes that spoil the vine see that's the
[45:44] problem with with little foxes is they
[45:46] kind of seem harmless matter of fact
[45:49] they're pretty stinking cute they look
[45:52] like something that you'd like yet you
[45:57] better hope you don't come here they
[46:00] look cute they look like something that
[46:02] would never hurt you you say well I
[46:04] don't see where this is bothering me so
[46:07] that's the problem that's the thing with
[46:08] little foxes you usually don't see them
[46:10] because they're sneaky usually don't see
[46:12] them because they're full of stealth
[46:13] usually don't see them because they can
[46:15] walk without making a sound you don't
[46:17] see them you don't see them coming you
[46:19] don't hear him coming all you know is as
[46:20] you wake up one day and you say what
[46:22] happened to my blessing what happened to
[46:25] my harvest what happened to my children
[46:27] what happened to my relationship with
[46:29] the Lord why my lukewarm did you deal
[46:32] with the little foxes did you deal with
[46:35] the little things that crept up in your
[46:36] life did you deal with that temper did
[46:39] you deal with that bitterness the thing
[46:41] that you thought was no big deal and it
[46:42] really wasn't wasn't hindering you did
[46:45] you deal with that unforgiveness that
[46:46] you never would let go of and you wake
[46:48] up one day and you go what happened to
[46:51] the rapture I thought there was supposed
[46:54] to be a body change well there was but
[46:56] little foxes came and they and they they
[46:58] ruined your vine and they stole your
[46:59] harvest they stole your blessings
[47:01] because you didn't deal with them when
[47:02] you had the opportunity to little things
[47:06] matter listen you don't think little
[47:09] things matter get a kidney stone
[47:16] get a kidney stone one time little
[47:19] things matter all right
[47:21] look at that and that's in the physical
[47:25] all right how much damage can a
[47:28] so-called little thing doing the
[47:30] spiritual to an individual to a family
[47:33] to evening like Tabernacle to the to the
[47:36] church body worldwide those things tend
[47:39] to spread like cancers when we don't
[47:41] deal with them they tend to spread from
[47:43] this family to that family to this
[47:45] church to that church and it turns into
[47:46] a little cancer that's eating away at
[47:48] people's victory eat the way at people's
[47:49] joy killing people's influence now they
[47:52] don't want to hear nothing that comes
[47:53] from this preacher that preacher and
[47:54] it's all because of this it's a little
[47:56] thing that didn't get dealt with there's
[47:58] not a one of us here that would sign up
[48:00] for a kidney stone there's not a one of
[48:02] us here that if we had the choice we
[48:04] could not a one of us so why are we
[48:09] allowing these little complexes and
[48:10] things to come in and we see it and we
[48:12] recognize what it is and we have the
[48:14] opportunity to defeat it but we sit
[48:16] there and we let that little Complex
[48:17] come on us let that little complex isn't
[48:20] going to stay a little complex for long
[48:21] that fear that comes up and it's just a
[48:24] little bit of anxiety and instead of
[48:25] standing there and cast in that thing
[48:27] away we let it come on us that little
[48:29] anxiety is not going to stay a little
[48:30] anxiety for long but it's not like a
[48:32] kidney stone where sometimes we don't
[48:34] have a choice
[48:35] in this situation we have a choice we
[48:37] have a say in the matter
[48:38] when that thing rises up in our life we
[48:40] have a choice to sit there and say I am
[48:42] a son of the Living God I'm a daughter
[48:44] of the Living God
[48:45] I'm the purchase of the price I was
[48:47] bought with the blood I will not accept
[48:49] this anxiety I will not accept this
[48:51] complex I will not accept this fear my
[48:54] name is not anxiety my name is not
[48:56] depression my name is not complex
[48:58] my name is overcomer my name is miss
[49:01] Jesus Christ
[49:02] name is I'm gonna take a rapture my name
[49:06] is Christian I have a right to every
[49:08] promise in the book I'm not gonna allow
[49:10] some evil name or evil spirit to attach
[49:13] itself to me and identify me with it I'm
[49:16] not gonna be identified with that we
[49:18] heard Sunday that we were given a new
[49:19] name my name is victorious I'm not going
[49:23] to be defeated by something I'm gonna
[49:24] tell it where it can go why can go there
[49:27] because I have a promise I'm a son of
[49:29] the Living God and I'm gonna cast it
[49:31] away from me I'm not gonna accept those
[49:33] little things because remember it's just
[49:36] wanting to destroy you that's what it's
[49:39] all about you are Miss Jesus Christ you
[49:43] don't have to accept those things you
[49:45] have the power and authority given to
[49:46] you by the bridegroom and the devil
[49:50] loves to come and put complexes on
[49:51] people one of the ones he really loves
[49:56] to throw at people's inferiority
[49:57] complexes make them feel like they're
[50:00] not good enough make them feel like
[50:02] they're not worthy make them feel like
[50:04] they're insignificant well join the club
[50:08] none of us are worthy no none of us are
[50:12] significant without Jesus Christ and
[50:15] what he did for us there's none of us
[50:16] even worth talking about there's none of
[50:18] us can do anything there's none of us I
[50:20] can just pull ourselves up by our own
[50:21] bootstraps and say well I'm going to
[50:23] overcome I'm going to go on a rapture
[50:25] we're all in the same boat none of us
[50:27] are just more worthy than another one
[50:29] but he loves to come and make people
[50:31] feel unworthy and and in it at the truth
[50:34] that matter is it's all the grace of God
[50:35] none of us will be where we are without
[50:37] the grace of God and and what he wants
[50:40] to do is he wants to give you this
[50:41] complex to keep you from giving what you
[50:45] have to the Lord because you don't feel
[50:48] like it's good enough you don't feel
[50:50] like it's even anything to give him you
[50:52] don't feel like well why would he even
[50:54] want this what can he do with this and
[50:56] he wants you to think that your gift
[50:58] isn't valuable so you keep it to
[51:01] yourself or he wants you to think that
[51:02] your life is unworthy so you never
[51:04] surrender it to him for his use and
[51:06] young people sometimes they deal with it
[51:08] more than anybody they can be plagued
[51:10] with all sorts of feelings of crippling
[51:12] insecurities and you know I'm not cool I
[51:15] don't fit in I don't have very many
[51:18] friends I don't have any gifts I'm all
[51:22] alone and what he is doing is he's
[51:24] robbing you of the vision that Jesus
[51:26] Christ has of you he's making you value
[51:30] things based off the way the world
[51:31] values things and taking your eyes off
[51:34] of the way Jesus values things you don't
[51:36] value things the way the world values
[51:38] things he don't look at little gifts and
[51:40] small gifts and and this promise is kind
[51:43] of a big promise and that's a small
[51:45] promise and this kid's cool in this kids
[51:47] know you're all beautifully and
[51:49] wonderfully made every single one of you
[51:51] are and if you have any gift from God
[51:53] it's a great gift there's no portion of
[51:55] God that's not great in one portion of
[51:58] God that's so much greater than another
[51:59] you've all been beautifully and
[52:01] wonderfully made and you've all been
[52:03] sitting here with the purpose and the
[52:04] devil wants to come and try to rob you
[52:06] of that purpose by making you value
[52:08] yourself based off of worldly values but
[52:11] value yourself based off of the way
[52:13] social media values things or the way
[52:15] Hollywood values things those things
[52:17] aren't reality now in reality I need you
[52:20] in reality I can't make it without you
[52:23] in reality you're just as important as
[52:25] anybody sitting up here in reality
[52:27] without y'all sitting out there this
[52:29] would be a pretty terrible service okay
[52:31] your is important to this service as
[52:34] anybody else is you're important to the
[52:36] bride as anybody else is you have a part
[52:38] to play just like anybody else does and
[52:40] I can't go to you get ready so I'm
[52:43] pulling for you I want you to know I'm
[52:44] on your side I want you to know that the
[52:47] devil can't hold you I want you to know
[52:49] tonight that God loved you so much then
[52:51] he came out and he took on flesh and he
[52:53] died for you how's that the next time
[52:55] the devil says you're not very
[52:57] really the king of kings and the Lord of
[52:59] lords important enough to come down and
[53:02] shed his blood for you that's pretty
[53:04] important but the world tries to change
[53:12] our sense of value of what is really
[53:14] worth something of what is really worth
[53:18] fighting for I say tonight if it's in
[53:21] the word we should value it I say
[53:24] tonight if they're part of the family of
[53:25] God we should value them I say if it's
[53:28] in the word it's worth fighting for it's
[53:30] our land it's where we've been returned
[53:32] to and we cannot let anybody or anything
[53:34] come in and rob any portion of it from
[53:36] us and tell us it's not for us it is for
[53:38] us it is for you it's for all of us many
[53:42] of the great leaders that's we actually
[53:44] find in the Bible watch they dealt with
[53:45] complexes we found that Moses he
[53:50] couldn't he couldn't speak and he
[53:52] stuttered and he made all kind of
[53:54] excuses of why he couldn't go down it
[53:57] was because of complexes Gideon had
[54:00] complexes you see in judges 6:15 and he
[54:04] said unto Him o my lord wherewith shall
[54:07] I save Israel behold my family is poor
[54:12] see that poor rich thing that's gone on
[54:15] since the beginning of time my family is
[54:18] poor in Manasseh and I am the least in
[54:21] my father's house not only is my family
[54:24] poor he's saying but I'm the worst of
[54:27] all of them I'm the lowest in a poor
[54:29] family
[54:29] listen God's not interested in who you
[54:32] are what family you came from what your
[54:35] mom and daddy did he's not interested in
[54:38] your worldly standing or your wealth or
[54:40] even your rank in your own family God's
[54:43] not even interested in what you can do
[54:45] God's interested tonight and what God
[54:48] can do through you if you will just
[54:51] surrender yourself and as I've heard it
[54:53] said before just be available be
[54:56] available say Lord I'm here I don't
[54:58] sometimes you may not even know what it
[55:00] is you have to offer you may not even
[55:02] know what it is you have to give but if
[55:04] you'll just step back and say Lord I'm
[55:06] available use me how you see fit
[55:09] let me say something to someone to
[55:10] encourage them today let me do something
[55:13] to encourage somebody along their way
[55:14] let me do whatever it is you want me to
[55:17] do Lord he will use you all he needs is
[55:20] a vessel all he needs is a willing
[55:22] vessel judges 6:16 says in the Lord said
[55:26] unto him surely I will be with thee see
[55:31] there's the answer right there it never
[55:32] it wasn't about Gideon it never was
[55:35] about Gideon it was about I will be with
[55:38] thee it was going to be the lord's
[55:40] victory anyway it was gonna be his
[55:41] victory all alone that's why when Gideon
[55:43] had this giant army he said no send them
[55:45] away send them away to it all the way
[55:47] all the way down to 300 that way they in
[55:49] no way could claim the victory but they
[55:52] would have to give credit to where it
[55:53] came from this is the Lord's victory
[55:55] this is the Lord's doing and when any of
[55:56] us get to the point that we think we're
[55:58] doing anything on our own we're about to
[56:00] fall flat on our face anytime we get to
[56:02] the point that we think we're something
[56:04] we're in trouble it's actually good
[56:06] sometimes when we sit back and we say
[56:07] Lord I don't know what I can do because
[56:09] those are the people that he'll use he
[56:11] uses common people he uses people that
[56:14] don't think too highly of themselves
[56:15] because then he can come in and he can
[56:18] use them the way he sees fit look at the
[56:20] profit of this day look at the man
[56:22] chosen in this day to fulfill Malachi
[56:25] 4:5
[56:26] it wasn't some high and lifted up
[56:28] theologian it was a man brother branham
[56:31] would say I come from bootleggers my
[56:33] family is no good no religion he says I
[56:36] don't even know how he saved me and yet
[56:39] that was the man he chose to use so when
[56:42] the complexes begin to come in we got to
[56:43] push those things out and recognize who
[56:45] we truly are we are sons and daughters
[56:48] of the Living God we are the bride of
[56:50] Jesus Christ that's something we can be
[56:52] proud about I may not can be proud of
[56:54] anything else in my life but I can throw
[56:56] my shoulders back and lift my head up
[56:57] and say Jesus Christ died for me Jesus
[57:00] Christ loves me Jesus Christ has given
[57:03] me the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ went to
[57:05] prepare a place for me and that's
[57:07] something that we can be proud about
[57:12] it's about somebody being available
[57:16] listen it's not just little things that
[57:19] the devil wants to come in and put in
[57:21] your life to to destroy you what he also
[57:24] wants to do is slip in and Rob you and
[57:27] make you look at the blessings of God as
[57:30] little things he wants you to look at
[57:33] them as small things or look at your
[57:35] gifts or things he's bestowed upon you
[57:36] as little things and he tries to make
[57:38] you value your gifts and the things of
[57:41] God is being too little it's funny how
[57:44] he works he'll get you to look at the
[57:46] things the enemy is bringing in and go
[57:47] well that's no big deal and use it to
[57:49] destroy you and then he'll get you to
[57:51] look at something that God's given and
[57:54] make you say that's no big deal and then
[57:55] you miss an opportunity to be a blessing
[57:57] he robs you of the opportunity that was
[57:59] given to you he keeps you from seeing
[58:01] the value in it look it must have been a
[58:06] normal day that day when the little boy
[58:10] headed to school with five loaves and
[58:12] two fish mom probably got up packed his
[58:15] lunch gave it to him said now you'd be a
[58:18] good boy at school today a little did
[58:20] she know he wasn't being a good boy
[58:23] brother branham said he played hooky
[58:25] Brown said he said I'm going fishing I
[58:28] don't blame him he said I'm going
[58:32] fishing but something happened on his
[58:34] way down to the river he was going past
[58:36] the mountain and something caught his
[58:38] ear something caught his attention
[58:40] aren't you glad something's caught your
[58:42] attention something caught his attention
[58:44] and he came over and he began to listen
[58:46] for a little bit and he began to hear a
[58:48] man speaking and the longer he stood
[58:51] there the more impressed he was and who
[58:53] this man was and and he listened for a
[58:56] while and something about that man was
[58:57] different something was different he was
[59:00] so humble and yet so full of authority
[59:03] there's something special about this man
[59:06] he was drawn to him and the boy knew
[59:08] that he was a great man a man to be
[59:11] respected the Bible would say tell the
[59:14] account like this in John 6 and 5 when
[59:18] Jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a
[59:19] great company come unto Him he saith
[59:21] unto Philip when shall we buy bread that
[59:25] these may eat and this he said to prove
[59:28] him for
[59:29] he himself knew what he would do don't
[59:31] you love that he already knows how he's
[59:34] gonna work out the situation in your
[59:35] life he already knows exactly how he's
[59:38] gonna bring about the end to an expected
[59:40] in for your good he already knows
[59:43] exactly what you're going through and he
[59:44] looks at and sometimes you get put in
[59:46] situations to where he can prove you
[59:48] listen it's not always going to be a
[59:49] flowery bed of ease you know if I'm will
[59:52] rain I must fight if I must rain
[59:53] increase my courage Lord there's times
[59:55] we're gonna go through things and we
[59:57] don't understand it but it says he
[59:59] already knew what he would do
[1:00:03] Phillip answer him two hundred
[1:00:06] pennyworth of bread is not sufficient
[1:00:08] for them that every one of them may take
[1:00:10] a little one of his disciples Andrew
[1:00:13] simon Peters brother said unto Him there
[1:00:15] is a lad here which has five barley
[1:00:18] loaves and two small fishes now listen
[1:00:21] to the very the very testimony of the
[1:00:24] disciple but what are they among so many
[1:00:29] even the disciple looked at a gift and
[1:00:33] he didn't value it this fella has a gift
[1:00:37] but what is that once that gift going to
[1:00:40] do at a meeting like this what's that
[1:00:43] gift gonna do at a service like this
[1:00:45] well put it in God's hand one time and
[1:00:47] watch there's been many at times there's
[1:00:49] been great gifted people that have stood
[1:00:51] in the middle of church services and sit
[1:00:53] there and they didn't hand it to the
[1:00:54] Lord and they may have belted with
[1:00:55] everything they had or even preached
[1:00:57] with everything they had but if it was a
[1:00:58] nun surrendered heart and it wasn't
[1:01:00] given to the Lord he couldn't do
[1:01:02] anything with it but in this moment the
[1:01:05] disciple looks at it and goes but but
[1:01:07] what is this among so many brother
[1:01:10] branham says here that Matthew was
[1:01:13] telling the story in Matthew's
[1:01:14] recounting the store and he's talking
[1:01:16] about when they're out on the boat
[1:01:17] giving the testimonies and he says and I
[1:01:20] asked him if I could have it and he said
[1:01:23] well I brought it for my dinner
[1:01:25] see this is something personal this is
[1:01:27] something he don't want anybody else to
[1:01:29] have maybe it's a complex no no it's
[1:01:34] this is mine no this is mine maybe it's
[1:01:37] a small gift that you're embarrassed for
[1:01:39] anybody to see cuz it's really not that
[1:01:41] much
[1:01:41] so you keep it hidden Matthew says he
[1:01:44] said I brought this for me but now
[1:01:47] listen but if it's to go to that man
[1:01:51] that I heard talk he can have it
[1:01:54] oh what an attitude tonight listen
[1:01:57] there's not much to it
[1:01:58] I don't really know I don't really know
[1:02:00] what you see in it I don't I don't see
[1:02:02] much in my gift but if it's for Jesus
[1:02:04] tonight he can have it I don't know what
[1:02:06] he sees in my life tonight I don't know
[1:02:08] why he'd want such a ring sinner like me
[1:02:10] I don't know I don't want people to see
[1:02:12] what I am but if it's for him tonight
[1:02:13] I'll give it to him I'll lay it all down
[1:02:16] for him if we can have that attitude
[1:02:18] tonight about everything in our life let
[1:02:20] this gift isn't much but if it's for
[1:02:22] Jesus I'll give it to him tonight I was
[1:02:24] giving every part of my being I'll give
[1:02:26] him every fiber of my being if it's for
[1:02:28] you Lord Jesus you can have it tonight
[1:02:34] Jesus can have it it's not much I may be
[1:02:38] a little embarrassed by it's poor man's
[1:02:41] food you see I'm sure you had a little
[1:02:47] bit of complex about what he had to
[1:02:49] offer Jesus because the scripture says
[1:02:51] they were barley loaves in the Bible
[1:02:55] times barley was a common crop in Israel
[1:02:58] I could said in Deuteronomy a land of
[1:03:01] wheat and barley but it was much more
[1:03:04] widely cultivated then than it is now
[1:03:06] and it was always valued less than wheat
[1:03:10] it was not considered fine flour
[1:03:13] we see this in 2nd King 7 1 where you
[1:03:16] see that the price of wheat is twice
[1:03:18] that of barley it even mentions it again
[1:03:20] in Revelation 6 when you see the price
[1:03:22] of wheat is much more than that of
[1:03:24] barley and in second Kings 7 1 it says
[1:03:28] then Elisha said hear you the word of
[1:03:29] the Lord thus saith the Lord tomorrow
[1:03:31] about this time shall a measure of fine
[1:03:34] flour be sold for a shekel and two
[1:03:37] measures of barley for a shekel so fine
[1:03:40] flour was worth twice as much as barley
[1:03:42] his poor man's food the rich people
[1:03:45] didn't eat barley as a matter of fact it
[1:03:48] was one of the main food sources for
[1:03:50] horses and donkeys
[1:03:54] it says in 1st Kings 4 and 28 barley
[1:03:57] also and straw for the horses and drama
[1:04:00] drama dairies brought they into the
[1:04:02] place where the officers were every man
[1:04:04] according to his charge it was also in
[1:04:08] the hill country the main food source of
[1:04:11] poor people and I'm sure at first he
[1:04:14] struggled to let the disciples have it
[1:04:16] he just sat there and saw such an
[1:04:17] important man such a mighty man words of
[1:04:21] life he recognized there's something
[1:04:23] special about this person and this man
[1:04:25] so important but my meal is so
[1:04:28] insignificant I've got nothing but poor
[1:04:31] people's food it's meaningless he
[1:04:33] probably thought that the Pharisees
[1:04:35] would never eat this the the Sadducees
[1:04:38] that they would they would never eat
[1:04:39] this I even heard one of his own
[1:04:42] disciples say that this isn't very much
[1:04:44] but what he did is he pushed past those
[1:04:47] thoughts he pushed past those complexes
[1:04:50] he pushed past that spirit of that
[1:04:52] wanted to make him feel insignificant he
[1:04:54] pushed past the complex and he said if
[1:04:56] this is for Jesus he can have it I love
[1:04:59] verse 11 verse 11 here is what makes all
[1:05:01] the difference John 6 11 it says and
[1:05:04] Jesus took the loaves and Jesus took the
[1:05:10] loaves will you give him your barley
[1:05:12] loaves tonight giving what you think is
[1:05:14] insignificant and what's the miracles he
[1:05:16] can do in your life give him what you
[1:05:18] think is insignificant and watch what he
[1:05:20] does in your home what's what he'll do
[1:05:21] an evening like Tabernacle if we'll just
[1:05:23] surrender the things that we think are
[1:05:25] insignificant the things that we think
[1:05:27] aren't that big a deal if we'll clean
[1:05:29] out the little things that we've been
[1:05:30] letting hold on to us if we'll just give
[1:05:32] it all to Jesus and what's the miracle
[1:05:34] that he will do I'm telling you tonight
[1:05:36] that he wants you and not just part of
[1:05:38] you he wants all of you he wants the
[1:05:40] parts of you that are in Barisan he
[1:05:42] wants the parts of you that nobody else
[1:05:44] knows about he wants you to come and lay
[1:05:46] them at his feet and he'll say and Jesus
[1:05:48] took his loaves and Jesus took his sins
[1:05:51] and Jesus took his complexes and Jesus
[1:05:54] took all his faults Jesus took all his
[1:05:56] failures
[1:05:57] Jesus took everything that you're giving
[1:05:59] tonight and he'll bless it and then
[1:06:01] he'll multiply his blessings upon your
[1:06:03] life
[1:06:05] whatever condition you're in tonight
[1:06:08] just say it's for Jesus he can have it
[1:06:10] and let Jesus take the loads tonight let
[1:06:14] him have your loads brother branham says
[1:06:15] and you notice as long as the lunch was
[1:06:18] in the little boy's hand it was just
[1:06:19] five loaves and two fishes but when it
[1:06:22] got into Jesus hand it fed 5,000 so the
[1:06:25] little things that we have if you just
[1:06:27] let him have it
[1:06:28] the little faith that we've got if we'll
[1:06:30] just let him have it it'll do great
[1:06:32] things he says you may not have very
[1:06:34] much but turn it loose I say turn the
[1:06:36] barley loose tonight turn it a little
[1:06:38] bit of faith you have loose tonight turn
[1:06:40] I'll turn it all loose tonight in the
[1:06:42] name of Jesus so let him have what you
[1:06:44] got if you got that much faith put it in
[1:06:47] him turn it loose and see what it'll do
[1:06:49] as long as his in the boys hand it
[1:06:52] wasn't much but when it got in here
[1:06:54] Jesus had it meant something it could it
[1:06:57] could only feed him there it could
[1:06:58] hardly do that but it fed 5,000 and take
[1:07:01] up baskets afterwards hallelujah my when
[1:07:04] I think of that my soul shakes and
[1:07:06] trembles when I think of what God can do
[1:07:09] with the life what he can do with your
[1:07:10] complexes and your shortcomings and your
[1:07:12] failures what he can turn us around
[1:07:14] we're nothing that we're on our way to
[1:07:16] hell a sinner's grave and a devil's hell
[1:07:18] but we put something in Jesus hands
[1:07:20] he'll lift you up and make a son or
[1:07:22] daughter of God on you tonight
[1:07:23] he'll forgive all your sins he'll
[1:07:25] forgive all your trespasses he'll fill
[1:07:27] you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:29] if you're just putting in Jesus hands
[1:07:31] tonight brother Brown says what kind of
[1:07:34] weapon you're gonna use you remember
[1:07:36] Pharaohs got a lot of chariots and
[1:07:38] swordsmen and horsemen and everything
[1:07:40] like that
[1:07:40] he had a Crooked Stick in his hand
[1:07:42] what's in your hand you might not be
[1:07:45] able to whistle but you can do something
[1:07:47] I think that did away with every excuse
[1:07:50] right there
[1:07:51] you might not can be able to whistle
[1:07:54] can't okay but you can do something
[1:07:59] whatever is in your hand use it to the
[1:08:02] glory of God give it to him and let him
[1:08:05] bless it and watch what takes place
[1:08:06] certainly no matter what it is it may
[1:08:08] seem little and insignificant to you but
[1:08:11] give it over to God one time the little
[1:08:13] boy had a lunch you
[1:08:14] wasn't very much to him but once in the
[1:08:17] hands of Jesus it fed 5,000 and they
[1:08:20] took up basketballs
[1:08:22] how many blessings and how many miracles
[1:08:25] are missed because we hold back what we
[1:08:28] have thank you
[1:08:34] how many blessings and miracles are
[1:08:36] missed because we hold back what we have
[1:08:38] to offer because we feel the barley
[1:08:41] loaves are insignificant you know
[1:08:45] sometimes things that even it even
[1:08:46] shocks the enemy what God does with some
[1:08:50] of the lives that come to him I think
[1:08:52] sometimes it even catches the enemy off
[1:08:54] guard when he he looks at somebody like
[1:08:56] me and then he sees what God has done
[1:08:59] and changed my life completely and he
[1:09:01] says you I know what he was I had him
[1:09:07] what I had him in my prison you're
[1:09:11] telling me he's going to do something
[1:09:12] for the kingdom of God you're telling me
[1:09:14] he's gonna stand in the last day and
[1:09:16] believe the endtime message that guy
[1:09:18] that guy was worthless guilty guilty as
[1:09:25] charged but when you lay it all down in
[1:09:27] Jesus feed when you give him the loaves
[1:09:30] and say just do what you will with it
[1:09:32] and you just become available he'll do
[1:09:34] amazing things in your life listen
[1:09:36] sometimes the enemy will become shot God
[1:09:39] takes maybe who people who maybe we
[1:09:41] think are nobodies once again he doesn't
[1:09:44] look at people and things and valued
[1:09:46] them the way that the world does look at
[1:09:51] the vision of Gideon judges seven
[1:09:53] thirteen now we've established what
[1:09:55] barley was and how barley was a port
[1:09:58] represented poor people in poor people's
[1:09:59] food and when Gideon was become behold
[1:10:02] there was a man that told a dream unto
[1:10:04] his fellow and said behold I dreamed a
[1:10:07] dream and lo a cake of barley bread
[1:10:09] tumbled into the host of Midian and came
[1:10:12] into a tent and smote it that it fell
[1:10:15] and overturned it that the tent lay
[1:10:16] alone now notice even in the dream the
[1:10:18] man had Gideon had said over there and
[1:10:20] said I'm poor I'm no good I'm from a
[1:10:22] poor family they didn't like the guy had
[1:10:24] a dream and they said up and said
[1:10:26] now I mean there was this fine loaf of
[1:10:28] bread made from the best flour and it K
[1:10:30] note the dreams showed getting exactly
[1:10:32] as he was poor man it showed him exactly
[1:10:36] how it was it showed what God will do
[1:10:38] with a man that doesn't have anything to
[1:10:40] offer he said it was a barley cake that
[1:10:43] tumbled into the host of MIDI and he
[1:10:45] came into a Tim and smote it that it
[1:10:47] fell and overturned it that the tent lay
[1:10:48] long look Gideon has typed out here is a
[1:10:51] barley loaf Gideon and his whole army
[1:10:54] had peasant beginnings and the man in
[1:10:56] the tent because they know what Gideon
[1:10:58] is because they know what that army of
[1:11:00] peasants is they instantly recognize the
[1:11:03] vision and they say it his fellow Antron
[1:11:05] said this is nothing else says the sword
[1:11:07] of Gideon the son of joash a man of
[1:11:10] Israel for into his hand has God
[1:11:12] delivered Midian and all the hosts I'm
[1:11:15] telling you tonight that you can destroy
[1:11:17] every devil every enemy everything that
[1:11:19] rises up against you and everything that
[1:11:21] exalts itself against the Word of God if
[1:11:23] you'll just put yourself into God's hand
[1:11:25] I don't care if you are an old barley
[1:11:27] low tonight I don't care if you can't
[1:11:29] whistle tonight I don't care if you
[1:11:30] think you have nothing to offer tonight
[1:11:32] put yourself in God's hand tonight and
[1:11:34] let him go to work with you put yourself
[1:11:37] in God's hand tonight and let him take
[1:11:39] you down to the tents of the enemy and
[1:11:41] smash the tents and destroy the enemy
[1:11:43] and send a runner toward the border land
[1:11:45] we're not going to let him stay in our
[1:11:47] land any longer it doesn't matter what I
[1:11:50] have it's not about me it's not about
[1:11:52] you it's all about him and what he can
[1:11:55] do through us they said it's Gideon it's
[1:11:59] getting in the hand of the Lord I wonder
[1:12:01] how often they had made fun and
[1:12:02] criticized ol Gideon I wonder how often
[1:12:05] they made fun and picked on this poor
[1:12:07] old Gideon his little iller crew
[1:12:09] ill-equipped group of misfits but in
[1:12:14] God's hands
[1:12:15] in God's hand listen even light
[1:12:17] tabernacle let them say what they want
[1:12:19] about you let the world say what they
[1:12:21] want about you let the devil say what he
[1:12:24] wants about you that you know good that
[1:12:25] you're Memphis that you're never gonna
[1:12:26] amount to nothing but in God's hands I'm
[1:12:28] telling you we're coming to tear satan's
[1:12:30] kingdom down I'm telling you in God's
[1:12:32] hands we're gonna tear his kingdom now
[1:12:34] we're gonna plant his kingdom we're
[1:12:35] gonna defeat every demon of hell and
[1:12:37] then we're gonna take a lap shirt in
[1:12:39] God's hands we're gonna overcome it and
[1:12:41] we're gonna rise above it all because
[1:12:43] it's not about what we can do we're in
[1:12:46] God's hands tonight we put our loans in
[1:12:49] God's hands we put all that we are in
[1:12:51] God's hands tonight in God's hands
[1:12:58] weren't invincible army we've been seen
[1:13:01] in the vision victorious over all our
[1:13:03] enemies we've been commissioned to tear
[1:13:07] satan's kingdom down what I love about
[1:13:14] Gideon is once he got them on the run he
[1:13:16] didn't stop it says in judges 84 and
[1:13:21] Gideon came to Jordan and passed over he
[1:13:26] and three hundred men that were with
[1:13:28] them now how many men do they have when
[1:13:29] they started 300 here we are later in
[1:13:33] the battle and how many men are left 300
[1:13:36] in God's hands we can't lose the one I'm
[1:13:38] telling you he's not gonna lose a worn
[1:13:40] that the father has given him he's not
[1:13:42] gonna lose a woman we're not leaving
[1:13:44] here and leaving one behind we're not
[1:13:45] leaving a hoof behind we're at the end
[1:13:47] of the battle and we got the same number
[1:13:49] because we're not giving up they may not
[1:13:50] be sitting here tonight but I'm claiming
[1:13:52] them tonight in our number because we're
[1:13:54] not leaving a hoof behind he says in 300
[1:13:57] men that were with him faint yet
[1:14:00] pursuing them well let that be us
[1:14:02] tonight let that be us tonight it says
[1:14:05] faint and yet pursuing them they were
[1:14:08] faint yet pursue him they were tired
[1:14:10] from the battle and yet they were eager
[1:14:12] to do more damage to the enemy's kingdom
[1:14:14] sometimes we may be tired and worn down
[1:14:17] sometimes you may be feeling like I'm
[1:14:19] about to give up you're faint you're
[1:14:20] right on the verge but you just keep
[1:14:22] pursuing that promise you
[1:14:24] maybe faint and I can't I can't take
[1:14:26] another step no sir you just keep
[1:14:27] pursuing that devil you just keep
[1:14:29] chasing that devil you just stay right
[1:14:31] on him until you run it completely off
[1:14:33] your promised land you may be faint yet
[1:14:36] we're still pursuing we're pushing him
[1:14:37] off our land
[1:14:38] we're fighting him off our promises
[1:14:40] until we obtain every single one of them
[1:14:42] and eventually we're gonna push him and
[1:14:45] we're gonna run our selves right into a
[1:14:46] body change we may be faint but we're
[1:14:49] still pursuing tonight the Bible tells
[1:14:52] us to forget not all his benefits that
[1:14:56] don't neglect any of them don't elevate
[1:14:59] some and put others down and see these
[1:15:01] aren't these aren't as important oh you
[1:15:03] forget not all of them if it came from
[1:15:05] God it's worthy to be praised it's
[1:15:07] worthy to be acknowledged that's why he
[1:15:09] told them there in Deuteronomy once you
[1:15:10] come into the land you partake of all
[1:15:12] these things then it takes take a moment
[1:15:14] and praise the Lord for it all because
[1:15:16] he doesn't want you to forget any of the
[1:15:18] blessings that he's given you and we're
[1:15:20] told not to forget not all of his
[1:15:23] benefits we're to be robbed of nothing
[1:15:26] if God put it in the land it's yours now
[1:15:31] remember that if God put it in the land
[1:15:33] it's yours if it's in the word it's
[1:15:36] yours but you're gonna have to fight to
[1:15:39] protect it tonight we can't give up
[1:15:40] anything no matter how small we may
[1:15:43] think it is and we've dealt with that we
[1:15:45] can't put labels on things this is a
[1:15:47] small blessing this is a big blessing
[1:15:49] this is a small thing this is a big
[1:15:50] thing if it came from God it's to be
[1:15:52] ours we are to possess it because the
[1:15:55] devil doesn't ever stop at the small
[1:15:58] things sure he may just be nibbling a
[1:16:01] little bit here he may just be bringing
[1:16:03] a little bit of trouble here on this
[1:16:05] side but that's not his endgame he wants
[1:16:08] to destroy you your children your family
[1:16:10] and it's saying it seems that he'd wants
[1:16:14] to destroy entire churches he wants to
[1:16:16] wipe out people's faith and then in
[1:16:18] belief but lately it seems like here in
[1:16:20] our church and in other places as well
[1:16:22] and I'll just say this from my heart it
[1:16:25] seems like there's just been a great
[1:16:26] washing that's just been taking place in
[1:16:29] people's lives a great washing taking
[1:16:32] place in people's homes as people have
[1:16:34] been making their calling and election
[1:16:35] sure and people
[1:16:36] getting things in order and people have
[1:16:38] been sweeping out everything and making
[1:16:41] sure all the Levin's out of their life
[1:16:42] and Levin's out of their home and we've
[1:16:43] seen the power of the Holy Spirit just
[1:16:45] moving in services and moving in
[1:16:47] people's homes and and we've been
[1:16:49] getting even even testimonies from other
[1:16:51] places of the power of God and and in
[1:16:54] the Holy Spirit pouring out and people
[1:16:56] being baptized and just great miraculous
[1:16:58] things going on and I believe that God
[1:17:01] is doing some amazing things
[1:17:03] I believe we're right on the verge I
[1:17:07] believe we're right there at the
[1:17:09] blending of time and eternity I believe
[1:17:11] this with all my heart and God is doing
[1:17:13] some very special things and I believe
[1:17:15] tonight that it's time we push a little
[1:17:17] harder I believe it's time we push just
[1:17:21] a little bit harder we may be faint but
[1:17:23] we got to keep pursuing we may be tired
[1:17:25] and a little born out but we got to keep
[1:17:26] pursuing I believe it's time that we dig
[1:17:28] a little bit deeper I believe it's time
[1:17:31] that we begin to pray like Amram did and
[1:17:33] say God is time to fulfill these
[1:17:34] promises God I believe it's it's time
[1:17:36] for these things to come to pass and the
[1:17:39] reason we say that is I believe that we
[1:17:40] can say just like it said there in the
[1:17:42] book of Acts at the time of the promise
[1:17:43] has drawn nine it's time for us to take
[1:17:47] back all the enemy has tried to steal
[1:17:49] from us and we we can't even let in this
[1:17:52] time even the small things go Church
[1:17:55] it's going home time it's rapture time
[1:17:58] it's time to check up make sure your
[1:18:00] lamps are trimmed and bright just being
[1:18:03] a good person in a good church member in
[1:18:06] and coming to church all the time and
[1:18:08] maybe even listening to tapes that's
[1:18:09] good thank God you do that but it's time
[1:18:11] to dig deeper it's time to consecrate
[1:18:13] more is time for sincerity like you've
[1:18:15] never had sincerity before we're right
[1:18:17] here at the judgment time it's right
[1:18:20] here at the going-home time and we can't
[1:18:21] let the devil come in and take anything
[1:18:23] not even a little piece brother Branham
[1:18:25] would say just about the time you get
[1:18:27] the church built up where it's right
[1:18:29] that's when the devil will come in he
[1:18:33] said that's the time to get your
[1:18:35] righteous indignation up we were not to
[1:18:39] forget any of his benefits
[1:18:41] we are not to forget any of his promises
[1:18:43] we are not to forget any of his
[1:18:45] instructions there is nothing too small
[1:18:48] that in this time we can let go by the
[1:18:49] wayside his blessed is so abundantly
[1:18:53] Psalm 68 19 blessed be the Lord who
[1:18:56] daily loaded the s' with benefits even
[1:18:59] the god of our salvation se la Psalms
[1:19:02] 103 to bless the Lord O my soul and
[1:19:05] forget not all his benefits psalms 116
[1:19:10] and 12 what shall i render unto the lord
[1:19:12] for all his benefits towards name it's
[1:19:17] time that we stand like israel standing
[1:19:19] and give no ground no matter how
[1:19:21] insignificant that ground may seem
[1:19:23] listen the enemy wouldn't want it if the
[1:19:26] ground was insignificant the enemy
[1:19:29] wouldn't be after your promise if he
[1:19:30] thought that promise was insignificant
[1:19:32] he wouldn't be after your joy if it
[1:19:34] wasn't important
[1:19:35] he wouldn't be after your peace if it
[1:19:36] wasn't important he's coming after it
[1:19:39] because to him it's worth fighting for
[1:19:41] its surprise to him it's a trophy to him
[1:19:44] but i'm telling you if you come against
[1:19:45] me and i'm standing with the living god
[1:19:47] one i'm the only one that's gonna have a
[1:19:49] trophy from this battle because i'm
[1:19:51] gonna take your head off
[1:19:52] i'm gonna raise it up for the whole camp
[1:19:54] to see and then we're gonna have a
[1:19:55] Philistine killing party we got to stand
[1:19:58] there when the enemy comes in if it's in
[1:20:00] the Word of God if it's promised to us
[1:20:02] we have to recognize it's worth fighting
[1:20:05] for it's worth standing for it's worth
[1:20:07] giving our life for every little piece
[1:20:10] it's worth giving your all for the fees
[1:20:14] for twenty seven neither give place to
[1:20:20] the devil
[1:20:21] that little thing he's fighting you over
[1:20:24] you say that's not a door he can't get
[1:20:26] in there but it may just be the foothold
[1:20:28] he needs it may be that one little
[1:20:30] finger hold he needs to get a hold of
[1:20:32] your life it may be the one little place
[1:20:34] he has access to you here in the word
[1:20:37] place in Ephesians means opportunity
[1:20:40] neither give opportunity to the devil
[1:20:42] but it also means here a portion of
[1:20:45] marked off space you can't even go okay
[1:20:50] devil that's your space
[1:20:54] stay there leave me alone I'll leave you
[1:20:57] alone you can't even give him a portion
[1:20:59] of Markov space first of all you're
[1:21:02] dealing with a liar a cheat a deceiver
[1:21:04] he's not going to stay in his portion
[1:21:06] he's not gonna stay there a minute the
[1:21:08] minute you turn your back you're gonna
[1:21:09] have a knife stuck in it because his job
[1:21:11] is to destroy you you can give him no
[1:21:13] place no piece of ground no matter how
[1:21:15] insignificant is he allowed to stay on
[1:21:17] no piece of promise no piece of the word
[1:21:20] no matter how much you may judge an
[1:21:22] insignificant can he be allowed to stay
[1:21:24] home we can't give him a portion we
[1:21:26] can't give him a space because he's not
[1:21:28] going to abide by look David had some
[1:21:31] mighty men that we read about we read
[1:21:33] about earlier and they didn't tolerate
[1:21:34] the enemy trespassing on their land I
[1:21:36] loved reading the accounts of the mighty
[1:21:38] men they did some mighty things they
[1:21:42] were some pretty incredible men the
[1:21:45] things that they would do and and
[1:21:46] because they were willing to stand they
[1:21:49] left a lasting legacy a testimony of men
[1:21:54] who were willing to fight for everything
[1:21:56] that was in the land they looked at it
[1:21:58] and said this is our land I don't care
[1:22:01] that that's just a rock that's my rock
[1:22:02] because it's inside my borders and
[1:22:04] you're not going to set foot on it they
[1:22:06] weren't willing to give the enemy
[1:22:08] anything they were willing to fight for
[1:22:10] all of in our opening scripture said in
[1:22:12] second Samuel 23 9 and after him was
[1:22:15] Eleazar the son of doto the Hawaii one
[1:22:19] of the three mighty men with David when
[1:22:21] they defied the Philistines that were
[1:22:24] there gathered together to battle and
[1:22:27] the men of Israel were gone away let's
[1:22:30] look at that part the men of Israel were
[1:22:33] gone away they had all fled they had all
[1:22:37] made a decision that this parcel of
[1:22:39] ground that they were fighting for
[1:22:41] wasn't worth fighting
[1:22:43] they said this this parcel of ground
[1:22:46] isn't worth dying for
[1:22:47] it's not worth it and they had gone away
[1:22:50] from the promises they had ran away
[1:22:52] chasing after new doctrines they had ran
[1:22:55] away chasing after worldly present
[1:22:57] pleasures but one Eleazar planted
[1:23:00] himself right in the middle of that
[1:23:02] promise he planted himself right in the
[1:23:04] middle of that field and he stood
[1:23:06] there and he's in he defied the
[1:23:08] Philistines
[1:23:09] there were Philistines in the land and
[1:23:11] someone was going to be willing to deal
[1:23:13] with my love how it says they defied the
[1:23:15] Philistines the word here actually means
[1:23:17] to rail against he wasn't sitting there
[1:23:21] quietly he was telling them everything
[1:23:22] they were everything they weren't
[1:23:25] everything he was about to do to them if
[1:23:26] they dared come over there he he was
[1:23:29] running his mouth he was letting them
[1:23:33] know exactly how it's going to be it
[1:23:34] says this word means to abrade and to
[1:23:37] taunt listen they didn't come into play
[1:23:40] church they didn't come into play church
[1:23:43] they didn't sit quietly and sit there
[1:23:45] praise Lord he came in and said listen
[1:23:47] here devil this is my land you're no
[1:23:49] good you're sorry I'm gonna kill you you
[1:23:51] think you want some of this you think
[1:23:53] you want this piece of ground how about
[1:23:55] you come over here and try to take this
[1:23:57] piece of ground and he playing himself
[1:23:58] right there on the promise and he stood
[1:24:00] there and it reminds me of the history
[1:24:02] of the Texas Revolution when a small
[1:24:05] group of men at the Battle of Gonzales
[1:24:07] which was the very first battle of the
[1:24:09] first skirmish of the resolution they
[1:24:11] had a cannon there in Gonzales and the
[1:24:14] mixing government sent a general and
[1:24:15] some soldiers and said I want you to go
[1:24:18] confiscate their cannon so this Mexican
[1:24:20] army comes marching and and in the men
[1:24:23] and Gonzales were outnumbered and the
[1:24:25] Mexican commander comes with orders to
[1:24:27] remove the cannon from the town and he
[1:24:29] sends a message to him and he says I've
[1:24:32] come to take the cannon we're going to
[1:24:34] take it away from you and that and the
[1:24:35] Texans there raised a flag in response
[1:24:37] and the flag they had stitched a big
[1:24:40] black cannon on it with with four words
[1:24:42] come and take it if more of us would
[1:24:47] have that attitude tonight when the
[1:24:48] enemy tries to come in instead of
[1:24:50] watching out the window as he's
[1:24:52] trampling all through our field and
[1:24:53] sitting sitting in the living room while
[1:24:55] your kids are wasting hours and hours on
[1:24:57] a worthless video game or snap chatting
[1:24:59] with some boy that you don't even know
[1:25:00] who they are putting on mascara in the
[1:25:03] back room while the Devils coming in
[1:25:05] stealing your happiness coming in
[1:25:06] stealing your piece how about you plant
[1:25:08] yourself right in the middle of one
[1:25:18] [Applause]
[1:25:25] [Applause]
[1:25:42] you're not taking our toy you're not
[1:25:45] taking our piece you won't have my
[1:25:47] children come and take it stand up in
[1:25:52] the face of the enemy tonight and say
[1:25:54] how about you come and take it if you
[1:25:57] think you come and take it
[1:26:00] that's what Elly's you're told the
[1:26:02] Philistines come and take it you got to
[1:26:08] make the decision that it's worth
[1:26:09] fighting for I ain't giving that devil
[1:26:14] one thing a man cannonball I'm not
[1:26:22] handing him over anything that God has
[1:26:25] promised me God said it was mine what
[1:26:27] makes him think I'm gonna give it to him
[1:26:31] and I got more than a cannon waiting on
[1:26:33] him I'm telling you I'm coming to you in
[1:26:35] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:26:37] name above all names every knee is going
[1:26:39] to bow and every tongue is going to
[1:26:40] confess you will move off my promise
[1:26:43] devil you will move off my children's
[1:26:45] life you will give me my peace back my
[1:26:47] home will serve and overcome through the
[1:26:49] Living God you will move sparked a
[1:26:54] revolution we need a revival sparked in
[1:26:57] our homes in our family telling one time
[1:27:00] come and take it
[1:27:00] quick giving it away telling come and
[1:27:03] take it second Samuel 2310 says and he
[1:27:07] arose and smote the Philistines until
[1:27:09] his hand was weary and his hand clayvin
[1:27:12] to the sword and the Lord wrought a
[1:27:14] great victory that day and the people
[1:27:17] returned after him only to spoil
[1:27:23] all those that had run away all those
[1:27:27] that didn't think it was worth fighting
[1:27:28] for
[1:27:29] all those who didn't want to get down in
[1:27:31] the trenches and fight the enemy now
[1:27:34] they return people who won't stand up
[1:27:36] and be identified people who don't think
[1:27:40] that some of the small things are worth
[1:27:42] the fight
[1:27:43] people who have let down the bar Sunday
[1:27:47] and Wednesday Christians only show up to
[1:27:50] collect the blessing but they don't want
[1:27:54] to get down in the trenches and do the
[1:27:55] fighting during the week one commentator
[1:27:58] would say regarding this it's common for
[1:28:01] those who quit the field when anything
[1:28:03] is to be done to hasten back to it when
[1:28:06] anything is to be gotten they just want
[1:28:10] the blessing without the fight without a
[1:28:12] battle they want to come and spoil from
[1:28:16] the victory but they wanted to sit back
[1:28:18] and once you do all the fighting what
[1:28:22] was it that was so important in that
[1:28:24] field what was it that even when all
[1:28:27] others ran Eleazar stood what was it
[1:28:31] that caused him to rail against them and
[1:28:33] even taunt them what was of such great
[1:28:36] value that it was worth dying for
[1:28:39] another account of this is in first
[1:28:42] Chronicles exact same story will chapter
[1:28:47] 11 verse 12 says and after him was
[1:28:52] Eleazar son of doto the Oh Hawaii who
[1:28:56] was one of the three Mahdi's who was
[1:28:57] with David at pasta man and there the
[1:29:00] philistines were gathered together to
[1:29:02] battle where was a parcel of ground full
[1:29:05] of barley animal food food for the poor
[1:29:12] and the people fled from the before the
[1:29:17] philistines and they set themselves in
[1:29:20] the midst of that parcel and delivered
[1:29:23] it and slew the philistines and the lord
[1:29:26] saved them by great deliverance
[1:29:30] listen barley wasn't worth very much but
[1:29:33] it was supposed to be in the land
[1:29:36] he said I'll give you a land with wheat
[1:29:38] and barley and figs and honey it was
[1:29:43] listed in the promise so it doesn't
[1:29:46] matter what mans value was it doesn't
[1:29:48] matter that other people said it wasn't
[1:29:50] worth anything he looked at and said
[1:29:52] that's part of the promise that's part
[1:29:54] of God's Word and I'm about to set
[1:29:56] myself down right in the middle of it
[1:29:58] and I dare you to come try to take a
[1:30:00] piece of God's Word from me
[1:30:01] it was worth fighting for it was worth
[1:30:03] dying for because it was in the word
[1:30:06] because it was part of the promise one
[1:30:09] group said it's just a barley field it's
[1:30:12] just one little barley field and the
[1:30:14] enemy's so many and I'm not gonna die
[1:30:16] for that this isn't worth it Eleazar
[1:30:22] said but it's in the promised land
[1:30:24] it's mine Eleazar said it's in the
[1:30:27] promised land it's mine and I will give
[1:30:29] the enemy no place to stand it wouldn't
[1:30:32] matter what kind of field it was it
[1:30:33] could have been a weed field that was
[1:30:35] growing nothing but bad terrible stuff
[1:30:37] but it refused in the promised land
[1:30:40] Eleazar was about to get off of his
[1:30:42] behead you're not going to stand in one
[1:30:44] of my fields I don't care what it's
[1:30:45] growing it's in my land it's part of my
[1:30:48] promises you're not taking my kids that
[1:30:51] part of my promise you're not taking my
[1:30:53] joy or my promise you're not taking the
[1:30:56] Holy Ghost experience under the church
[1:30:57] it's promised to be here
[1:30:59] you're not gonna rob this generation of
[1:31:02] an opportunity of revival the same
[1:31:04] chance you got I'm gonna stand right
[1:31:07] here
[1:31:07] proclaim truth and fight off every enemy
[1:31:10] that tries to rob the Word of God from
[1:31:12] us it was in the word it doesn't matter
[1:31:16] what others say if it's promised if it's
[1:31:18] in the word it's worth fighting for
[1:31:22] stand for truth when others run away
[1:31:25] brother Brown says if this isn't the
[1:31:28] truth
[1:31:28] it's the biggest arrow of error the
[1:31:30] world's ever had but if it is the truth
[1:31:33] then I'm willing to die for it and I
[1:31:36] have found that every word is true
[1:31:40] there's no shadow of doubt in my mind I
[1:31:44] love how I said he stood there and he
[1:31:46] defied the Philistine
[1:31:48] I say tonight we stand and defy any
[1:31:51] thing that would exalt itself against
[1:31:52] the promises of God defy the enemy when
[1:31:55] others promote false doctrines defy the
[1:31:58] enemy when he tries to come in and rob
[1:32:00] the holy ghost out of our services defy
[1:32:03] the enemy we wants to come in and keep
[1:32:04] this generation from having a revival we
[1:32:06] defy that you young people can have the
[1:32:09] Holy Ghost it's for you and as - as many
[1:32:10] as the Lord God shall call defy the
[1:32:13] enemy that that wants you to come in and
[1:32:15] wear makeup and fold - peer pressure
[1:32:16] defy the enemy when when others are
[1:32:19] wearing immoral clothes stand up and
[1:32:20] exalt modestly and exalt holiness defy
[1:32:23] the enemy say it's in the word I'm gonna
[1:32:25] stand on it you may not think it's worth
[1:32:27] the battle you may not think it's worth
[1:32:28] the ridicule you may wear away from it
[1:32:30] I'm not running away from it it's in the
[1:32:32] word I'm going to stand on it if you
[1:32:34] want to receive the big blessings of God
[1:32:36] then you got to keep even the smallest
[1:32:37] words of God you got to stand on every
[1:32:40] word not give in because mighty men
[1:32:43] leave legacies mighty men leave legacies
[1:32:46] that they're not going to bend and
[1:32:47] they're not going to break they're not
[1:32:50] going to give up the barley field I'm
[1:32:53] not going to allow the enemy to take any
[1:32:55] of my promises but further here and it's
[1:32:57] just a barley field it's just a little
[1:33:00] thing it's not that big a deal
[1:33:04] listen you can't have that attitude
[1:33:06] denied he gave you barley it's in the
[1:33:11] land it's a big deal
[1:33:12] you're to possess it it's time to stand
[1:33:16] there and say come and take it if you
[1:33:18] think you want this barley if it's worth
[1:33:20] the fight to you if it's worth dying for
[1:33:21] to you I'm right here come and take it
[1:33:24] this is the very same barley field I'm
[1:33:28] not gonna have time to really go into
[1:33:29] this but I found this so awesome passed
[1:33:32] them in is the very same barley field
[1:33:35] that the Philistines had camped in when
[1:33:38] Goliath was coming out to make his boast
[1:33:40] this is the very same place they had
[1:33:43] camped when Goliath would walk out of
[1:33:45] this barley field and walk out and
[1:33:46] challenge the armies of the Living God
[1:33:48] and everyone had run away except David
[1:33:51] and now here we are once again and now
[1:33:54] here's David once again with his mighty
[1:33:56] men and once again everyone's run away
[1:33:58] but mighty men don't run men of faith
[1:34:01] don't run men of faith leave a legacy
[1:34:03] men of faith leave a testimony and Dave
[1:34:06] and his mighty men stand in the same
[1:34:07] place once again and say I come to you
[1:34:10] in the name of Jesus Christ I come to
[1:34:13] you to take your head off
[1:34:14] you let that devil know Jesus has paid
[1:34:16] for it all I'm standing here listen
[1:34:19] recognize this this is the same place
[1:34:21] that the Philistines were defeated and
[1:34:22] completely slaughtered just because you
[1:34:24] have a victory over the devil in one
[1:34:26] area of your life doesn't mean he's not
[1:34:27] gonna come back there and try you again
[1:34:29] doesn't mean he's not gonna come back
[1:34:31] there and scratch at the windows and
[1:34:32] howl and claw at the door but he can't
[1:34:34] get back in he can't come back in if
[1:34:37] you'll stand there on the word and say
[1:34:38] no you've been defeated here once before
[1:34:40] we stand here once again to rebuke you
[1:34:42] once again you're gonna be defeated just
[1:34:44] as soundly this time as you were last
[1:34:46] time they're standing in the very same
[1:34:49] place that David stood and the enemies
[1:34:51] come back again to a place he's been
[1:34:54] defeated to challenge them once again
[1:34:56] and Dave and his mighty men are standing
[1:34:58] there why are they standing there
[1:35:00] because the promises are worth fighting
[1:35:03] for I believe tonight your promises are
[1:35:07] worth fighting for I believe you as an
[1:35:11] individual are worth fighting for I
[1:35:13] believe Jesus Christ felt that way when
[1:35:15] he fought his way up Calvary's Hill and
[1:35:17] fought through every devil of hell and
[1:35:18] everything try he could have walked away
[1:35:20] from that but he said you're worth
[1:35:21] fighting for
[1:35:22] he said you're worth dying for and he
[1:35:25] sent back promises and he sent back his
[1:35:26] word and he said you could have peace he
[1:35:28] said you could have joy you could have
[1:35:30] helped he said you can have a healthy
[1:35:32] marriage he said that you could have
[1:35:33] your children I believe it's all worth
[1:35:36] fighting for tonight I believe you have
[1:35:38] to fight tonight I believe it tonight
[1:35:39] that it's your opportunity to deliver
[1:35:41] the barley there may be an enemy
[1:35:44] standing there in your field tonight but

[1:40:38] a sore one who stood there and swung the
[1:40:41] word of the Lord so much that his hand
[1:40:43] couldn t become loose from it soon many
[1:40:45] today their hands are cleaving to some
[1:40:47] ball or a bat or a remote control or
[1:40:49] something like that that'll never
[1:40:50] deliver you that'll never set you free
[1:40:53] but if you grab ahold at this one time
[1:40:54] and say I'm not gonna let go and you
[1:40:56] hold on to and you go to swinging and
[1:40:58] fighting and killing and standing on
[1:40:59] your promises say I'm not going to move
[1:41:01] how about you come and take it and one
[1:41:03] day they may have to cleave this out of
[1:41:05] my hand but I'm going to leave a legacy
[1:41:07] behind that I stood for truth I
[1:41:09] delivered the barley field I didn't let
[1:41:11] the enemy stay there I don't care what
[1:41:13] kind of field it was it's in my land I
[1:41:15] will deliver the barley and tonight even
[1:41:17] like Tabernacle where it wraps her time
[1:41:20] we're it going home time and it's time
[1:41:22] you deliver the barley fields in your
[1:41:24] promised land those things that may not
[1:41:26] seem like big deals but the enemies
[1:41:27] can't down run them out send a packet
[1:41:30] they have no right to stay there
[1:41:32] we're about to go home but you've got to
[1:41:35] clean out the land you've got to clean
[1:41:37] them out if you're going to possess
[1:41:39] everything that God has for you I
[1:41:41] believe it's there for you I believe
[1:41:43] we're going to take it but we got to
[1:41:45] press down we got to press in we got to
[1:41:48] take the word and stand on that promise
[1:41:50] tonight cut through the darkness so we
[1:41:55] bring this down to a close see small
[1:41:59] things add up to big things just keep
[1:42:04] picking up the handfuls and by the end
[1:42:07] of the night you got a bag full you got
[1:42:10] a sack full but you got to pick up the
[1:42:13] little things as you go and you start
[1:42:15] picking them up before long you got an
[1:42:17] abundance
[1:42:18] just keep walking in victory keep
[1:42:21] claiming every promise and letting the
[1:42:24] enemy have no place to stand no place I
[1:42:28] don't care what kind of field you find
[1:42:31] him standing in your life tonight give
[1:42:33] him no place
[1:42:34] stand there tonight with the word and
[1:42:37] say you will have no place in my
[1:42:40] promised land you will have no
[1:42:43] opportunity to get into my life I'm
[1:42:44] going to take care of this while it's a
[1:42:46] little Fox one-day Church we're going to
[1:42:49] deliver the barley one last time one day
[1:42:53] it's going to be the last time you have
[1:42:54] to fight one day it's gonna be the last
[1:42:57] time that you have to get up and look at
[1:42:59] that old devil in the eyes but until he
[1:43:02] takes his home I'm gonna make sure he
[1:43:04] ain't got nothing that belongs to me
[1:43:05] until he takes me home on my stand and
[1:43:08] fight and I'm gonna value everything
[1:43:10] that's in the word I'm not gonna put
[1:43:12] some things down I'm gonna say if it's
[1:43:14] in the word it belongs to me we're right
[1:43:16] on the verge of the greatest promise
[1:43:18] finally coming to pass prophet God says
[1:43:23] do you believe it say Amen what's the
[1:43:26] next thing we're looking for the rapture
[1:43:28] going to meet him the coming son will
[1:43:32] have to be changed and caught up you
[1:43:34] can't be caught up the way you are now
[1:43:35] you're too heavy
[1:43:37] oh but brother one day this mortal will
[1:43:39] take on immortality and will have a body
[1:43:42] like his own glorious body for we shall
[1:43:44] see him as he is
[1:43:45] oh you seed of Abraham hold to your
[1:43:48] promise he says hold to your promise
[1:43:51] honey
[1:43:51] stay with it don't let no man rob you
[1:43:54] from that even in light Tabernacle let
[1:43:57] no man no spirit no devil of hell rob
[1:44:00] you of everything the Lord has given you
[1:44:02] because we're right at the point we're
[1:44:04] fixing to go home we're fixing to take a
[1:44:07] rapture I want us all to go make sure
[1:44:11] there's no little foxes running around
[1:44:13] in your barley fields deliver the barley
[1:44:15] tonight you bow your heads with me you
[1:44:23] know the way that the enemy comes at me
[1:44:24] may be different from the way that he
[1:44:26] comes at you some people we may come
[1:44:30] without fear unbelief some people he may
[1:44:34] come with trouble in the home but
[1:44:37] usually it starts with the small things
[1:44:40] sometimes it starts with things that we
[1:44:42] don't deem very important it starts and
[1:44:46] things that we don't value as much as a
[1:44:48] because the world sometimes warps our
[1:44:51] idea of value what true value really is
[1:44:55] the world warps our idea of what's worth
[1:44:58] fighting for I want to say it once again
[1:45:01] if it's in the word it's worth fighting
[1:45:04] for if it's in the promises it's worth
[1:45:07] fighting for the barley field was in the
[1:45:11] promised land and eleazar left a legacy
[1:45:14] a lasting legacy I ask you tonight what
[1:45:19] will be your legacy will you be one who
[1:45:24] stood there and defied the the enemy I
[1:45:27] stood there and said I won't give you an
[1:45:30] inch I won't back up or you be one who
[1:45:35] ran away when the fight got too tough
[1:45:37] and you didn't think it was that big of
[1:45:38] a deal what will be your legacy
[1:45:43] we're going home Church we're going home
[1:45:49] we're right here at it deliver your
[1:45:54] barley field father we love you with all
[1:45:57] of our heart well we thank you that
[1:46:00] you've given us the strength Lord to
[1:46:01] deliver the message I just pray father
[1:46:03] that you'll take it and use it how you
[1:46:06] see fit what I pray that we won't just
[1:46:09] be hearers of the word door but we'll be
[1:46:11] doers Lord many things I said tonight
[1:46:14] spoke directly to my heart and pricked
[1:46:17] my heart things I need to take care of
[1:46:19] Lord Jesus may we not be guilty of
[1:46:22] neglecting any of your promises may we
[1:46:25] not be guilty Lord of forgetting even
[1:46:26] one of your benefits Lord you've died
[1:46:30] that we could have those things
[1:46:32] Lord you went through agonizing
[1:46:34] punishment and took horrible stripes and
[1:46:36] worse beaten so I could have those
[1:46:38] benefits lord give us the strength to
[1:46:41] stand and the courage to stand now when
[1:46:43] people want to take those benefits away
[1:46:45] when spirits want to come in and rob us
[1:46:47] of the joy of our salvation of the peace
[1:46:50] that passes all understanding though
[1:46:52] there's people that fight anxiety and
[1:46:55] fear and you said I will keep him in
[1:46:56] perfect peace but we have a word Lord
[1:46:59] those things are in our promised land
[1:47:01] and what I found it to be such a good
[1:47:03] landlord it's even more than what I
[1:47:05] could have imagined it would be
[1:47:07] Lord this land is wonderful Lord may I
[1:47:11] never let a squatter some evil spirit
[1:47:13] come in and squat on this land or
[1:47:16] they're not part of the inheritance
[1:47:17] they're not heirs like we are give us
[1:47:20] strength to stand Lord may be weary
[1:47:22] tonight Lord but may we be pursuing
[1:47:24] maybe worn out from the battle but may
[1:47:27] we still be pursuing until the enemy is
[1:47:30] all driven out until the kingdom of
[1:47:32] Satan has been torn down Lord may he not
[1:47:36] have one day of peace as long as we're
[1:47:38] on this earth
[1:47:39] but may we defy him and stand on the
[1:47:43] promises tonight Lord we love you bless
[1:47:46] every person here tonight every family
[1:47:49] this represented Lord I pray that your
[1:47:51] presence will go with us as we depart we
