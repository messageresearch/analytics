and fellowship together with him and he's here to bring you in that fellowship today amen to bring you into a greater relationship with Christ man that the whole thing is deeper fuller more but that ought to be the cry of our hearts today amen let's just look to the Lord today as we pray father were your children that has gathered together in your name we're thankful for your grace to us Lord on divine mercy and love Lord that you have not forgotten your children for you said I'll never leave you or forsake you but I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world we thank you for this time Lord that we have to dress today the purchase of your blood Lord the ones that you have redeemed by grace Lord as we speak to them here in this congregation and to those that will be joining with us around the world or streaming the service at a later time I pray Lord your minister to them in a mighty way you'll speak to us and reveal to us your fullness today may there be a mighty outpouring of the Holy Ghost that washes away sin baptizes new believers into the and live god lord I prayed that it'll wash away doubts and unbelief Lord that the word would soul so work among us that would speak to hearts and lives and lift him up out of the doldrums of life and put them up there where Joey never fails I pray now father did you bless now the word as it goes forth and bless it for it's a tent intended purpose and may we be sensitive to the Holy Ghost today and father knowing that there's delicate things that we always Minister it from the pulpit Lord there's a proper way to say things and I just pray Lord you'll help us father to say things in the right way not only that but Lord when we're laying out the word how important it is to rightly divide the word of truth so we ask that you would hide us behind the cross guard our lips that we say nothing that we shouldn't say Lord but be straight on the word of God Lord that your people can be confident that your word is true and the Lord may your word reveal today even the thoughts of the intents of the heart and speak to lives and hearts in Jesus name Amen amen god bless you amen then they're good to be in the house of the Lord today amen we have dedicated this place to him so it is his house amen as that we come to honor him to worship helman I pray that today he'll speak to you in a mighty mighty way I was yesterday over Dallas Fort Worth brother mcGarry's meetings and we have to hear brother Tim Humes and brother Tom rayon and Minister Theron and there's a number of our folks out there this weekend but in a way of it was a great meeting that they were having and just the presence of the Lord and we thank God for that Amen I'm glad we're not alone amen I'm glad that there's a bride around the world I'm glad that with our sister churches and fellow believers amen you know we could be like Daniel was who who got separated from all his friends and and fellow church members and served God alone in his generation but God has blessed us in a mighty mighty way amen that we can have fellowship with one another amen and just this assembling of ourselves together to come together and share today our lick of fire with one another in words of encouragement with one another is always very very important and part of the Christian duty a man so good to be in the house of God together let's sing the song it's a is always my theme and I want us to sing it that today is Jesus on the inside working on the outside because really if we don't accomplish that having Jesus on the inside and changing our lives we have accomplished nothing by coming to the church or being religious or or anything if it ain't Jesus on the inside and working on the outside we have failed what we've been called to do hey man so let's listen sing it together now well it's Jesus song [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we got to display our token Amen that the blood of Christ has been applied to our lives and they you know and we can talk about it all we want to well it's on the inside but it's got to show on the outside amen god bless you let's turn to Galatians chapter 3 and verse 23 for our scripture reading this morning and we have some things we're going to be minister known I'm going to take this I'm going to call this part the age of life and we're talking about the AIDS of time that we're living in and that it is the age of the personal life of Jesus Christ amen that's what's got to be displayed not not a profession of faith not a work of sanctification not even a demonstration of a gift of the Spirit but the very personal life of Christ being on display and this is this must take preeminence over everything and one thing that you seek for with all your life with all your heart is to have his life on display in yours amen whether you're a young person or whether you're an older person whether you're in middle-age whether you're young married whether you're at the time of marriage it doesn't matter what age or stage of life you're in you must display Christ to this generation this time amen so Galatians chapter 3 and verse 23 but before faith came we were kept under the law and I may take just a moment and explain some of these verses as we go along but as Paul was dealing with the Galatians who were actually new Christians but now they were being pulled back by the Judaizers Judaizers back into circumcisions keeping certain days and rituals or whatever and Paul is trying to show them that that that was a time of the law what we were under the schoolmaster to bring us to Christ to show us the need for Christ so he would use different things for example the Sabbath day rest to show you there was a rest coming and when you have entered into the Holy Ghost you have entered into that Sabbath rest so that's our true keeping of the Sabbath amen circumcision again which would be a show within the flesh God claiming the seed life and and that that of course spiritually happens by the baptism of the Holy Ghost where that we are circumcised by the new birth so but before faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed wherefore the law was our schoolmaster now these are key statements the law the schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ now some of you have your message student you know right now brother Branham taught us that the tutor was the Holy Ghost well sure he is the holy the tutor or the schoolmaster is the Holy Ghost using the law to convince you of the sin in other words showing you that you cannot keep it on your own and the manna and convincing you you're doing this wrong you're doing that wrong is showing you the law and that you're still a law breaker so you you need the Holy Ghost in to set you free from the bondage of sin so he's a schoolmaster to bring us to Christ so it's the convicting power of God that we might be declared righteous are justified by faith but after that faith is come we no longer are we are no longer under a schoolmaster so we're no longer under the law Amen because now Christ has come and so we're not under the law and it's rules and regulations rather there's a law of God within our hearts Amen that causes us to keep the word for you are all the children God by faith in Christ Jesus for as many of you um as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ and there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for you are all one in Christ Jesus and if you be Christ and then you are be you are you Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise now we're going right now down into verse one now I say he says after I've established this this is what I'm saying that the heir as long as he is a child now when are you a child when you're under the schoolmaster a man before Christ comes and so he is type in this as the heir now before Christ comes you know yet you're you're potentially heir of everything but you differ nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all so potentially he's Lord of all but as a child he can't come and choose his full inheritance and participate in the inheritance are you with me alright but is under tutors and governors unto the time appointed of the Father now he's actually taken the Greek Roman law of adoption of how a child now is to be child trained and he comes to that age of maturity where he can be now about father's business and doing the father's work and acting in the father's name so is even but is under tutors and governors into the time appointed of the Father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world see because we were we're still sinners we were still working with this not even though potentially we were children of God we're still in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are sons God has sent for the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father and wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then heir of God through Christ a man reaches a point in your life you're no longer a servant but a son and use the son all the time but you differed nothing from a servant though you were Lord of all potentially but when Christ come by the power of the Holy Ghost in your life then you are no more a servant among the relationship changes and the kingdom is handed over to you and man and you're an heir of God through Christ everything that God has is yours hey man that all comes by the new birth god bless you you can be seated I want to remind you that well you know as what our theme has been is the people of the book have returned to the land of the book and let me remind you again why we have returned here why have we come back to the land of the book how come we come back to this promised land of the Holy Ghost that is so that we might see the Messiah it is a rapture age as a rapture time and so to be able to to receive this rapture there's got to be a people in their homeland amen now so so we have returned to this homeland for the rapture of the Bride of Christ this is the ultimate of the very reason why become we have not come to establish churches that will be different from the Methodists Baptists or Presbyterians we have not come here so that um we could have a little place that just preaches different doctor than everybody we have come here to see the Messiah we have come we have returned to this place for the rapture of the Bride of Christ amen to see Jesus return and he he's got to have a people who have made himself ready he's got to have a people who are positioned in their the land of the promise and are ready for him to come Nepal is showing the Galatians that there was a freedom in Christ that moved the church from servanthood to sonship now that ought to be the goal of every person is to leave servanthood behind and become a full-fledged son of God amen now there were others of course in that time that we're trying to provoke the gospel and to bring them back in the bondage under the law now I just want to get back to you for a moment Nepal when we're done we talk about these men and he would even talk about his stance and he was saying I can't preach any other revelation than what I preached and he said no one can add to this and no one can take away from it if you look with me in Galatians 1 8 you'll see he become emphatically says it twice we won't read but the incidences but right there in the same chapter he says though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed amen so he becomes very very clear and emphatic that nothing else can be preached but what I preached and he said because what I preached to you is the unadulterated Word and it can't be changed and he was separating law from grace and of course here was the people of the past age that was trying to confuse the Galatians with the past ideas and doctrines and trying to intermingle it and mix it with what Paul was preaching and and Paul was had separated law in Grayson he said I can't preach you any other gospel and if anybody know we and he includes himself or if an angel from heaven comes and preach any other gospel than what I preach to you let him be accursed now you see and I'm quoting this now from the church's book on this scripture it was the Apostles who brought the original word to the people and that original word could not change even a dot or a dash it and Paul knew it was God who spoke it who had spoken it to him so he said even if I come and try to give a second revelation and try to make one little change and what I gave originally let me be accurst you see Paul knew that the first revelation was correct and God can't give a verse revelation and then a second revelation if he did he would be changing his mind so now he can't give me original church and Christ be our high priest and his blood be what is necessary to cleanse us from sin and we get down to the end here and we don't need a high priest and so the blood is replaced for some make-believe faith that we claim to have to end and so again again Paul knew what he had preached was correct and let me tell you that's got to be the gospel that we preach today it is not cannot be something added to or taken away from so Paul knew the first revelation was correct God can't give a first revelation and then a second revelation if you did he would be changing his mind he can't give a revelation and then add to it as he did in the Garden of Eden when he promised the seed to the woman and then later designated that the seed had to come through Abraham and then later said it would come by the same bloodlines and David but it was the same revelation it only gave the people more information to help them receive and understand it but the word cannot be changed I'm not gods that kind of a God whatever he said that's the way it stands amen times don't change it personal opinions don't change it even a prophet can't change it the Apostle Paul himself couldn't change it it is our absolute remember that the Bible is our absolute now brother Branham never one time ever said he was our absolute he said the Bible the Word of God is our absolute amen now of course we believe that brother Branham preached the Bible so therefore we can take what he said but again ever revelation of ours has got to have scriptural foundation it cannot be contrary to the word and if you give some ideas from and you want to take and cherry-pick your quotes and come up with some different idea if it don't come along with what's in the Bible if it comes to conclusions the Bible didn't make from Genesis to Revelation for example blood it takes blood all the way from Genesis all the way through revelation all the way to the impact God will only redeem papa there is no redemption of any kind except by blood hey man hey man now uh well you know again from the church Facebook I'd like to share this it's just skipping down a little bit in the page one of these days there's gonna come a prophet to the Laodicean Church age and you will know if he's a real one sent from God or not oh yes you will for if he is of God he will be in that word exactly as God gave it to Paul he will not deviate from that word for a moment not by one eye odor in that last age when there will be many false prophets appearance watch and see how they keep telling you that if you don't believe them and what they say you know is that you you'll be lost in other words you don't get my revelation you don't have my take on things if you can't see it this way you're gonna be lost you're gonna miss the rapture and he said he said there'll be many false prophets that will come he meant but he said if when that last a prophet comes he on the scene he if he's truly that prophet he will be crying out get back to the word or you're lost he won't build on private revelation or interpretation but on the word amen and amen now that's what your trumpet had to say about a man he realized himself he could not bring another message that Paul didn't bring a man or another gospel that Paul didn't didn't bring you said well but now brother Tim we got more then Oh what Paul had no we've got exactly what Paul preached hey man we cannot deviate it not one iota so what we we got the understanding of the book of Revelation yeah the book of Revelation wouldn't even written to Paul Paul didn't even know it he was gone before it was even written hey man so it was left for this endtime people but not to bring us on another gospel that Paul didn't bring but to bring us back to show us how the church got off the track and bring us back to Paul's gospel once again hey man now so again let me just get it clear the only place a rapture is going to be is if you are in the homeland of the Holy Ghost of this Bible are you with me back in the word again and that's gotta be your measured line not your experience or jumping or shouting or dancing or are we I believe the message or I've got a profession of faith or I believe God sent a prophet but your your you've got to have your faith firmly I am the Word of God amen so his story it's coming right back to this Bible again back to the homeland again like we said that's the only place the rapture is going to be the rapture will not be for anyone outside of the homeland let's just look at this thought just as a type now just as Abraham wanted Sarah to be buried in DES and the homeland he had been given the land so he when Sarah died he buried her in the Cave of Machpelah right and my brother branham could tell us exactly why he said because you had been in that land and Joe was buried in that lamb and so Jove at the revelation that I know that my Redeemer liveth remember Joe was before Abraham is not there in the Bible his words chronologically his place but actually Jobe predated Abraham are you with me and Joe had a revelation you know that in my flesh I will see God so he knew that the Messiah would be coming to that land and Jobe was buried in that promised land and he wanted also Sarah buried in that promised land now what does that type show us that type shows us that everyone who is buried in Christ will be a part of that resurrection every one of us who are in Christ will be a part of that rapture there will be no rapture for anybody outside of that promised land amount now so everyone was to be buried in the promised land and we know that everyone that is buried in Christ will be in that resin correction and in this case it will not be anyone raptured who is not in Christ amen you have to be in the promised land to see the Messiah those who remain behind like those coming from Egypt those who stayed in Egypt died there those who died in the world of wilderness you know Jesus was safe there everyone dead a man those who stayed at caters Barnea and died in the wilderness going around the mountain over and over and over again around the mountain never entered into the promised land they died there amen jesus said there everyone dead are you with me Amen now now again I just want to say you you must not just be in the stage of coming into the land for the rapture you must be in the promised land and the promised land the years the Holy Ghost and of course that's the same as the word because the word in the Holy Ghost is the same so you see we must be in the word but that is the Holy Ghost we must be in the Holy Ghost but that is the word you can't have the Holy Ghost not being the word and you can't be in the word and not have the Holy Ghost all right now so you see as we said you know those who remain behind outside you know looking into the promised land just on the stages of the journey into the Holy Ghost will not go in the rapture then you know where that place is you if you're not in the land you're not rapture ready amen you're gonna have to be in the land you're gonna have to be in the Holy Ghost now how many would like to go on the rapture hey ma'am now to do so you're gonna have to have more than a portion of the Spirit amen you're gonna have to have more than a confession of faith and a confession of faith is a work of the Holy Spirit that leads you to embrace the knowledge of Christ and his message but it is yet but a portion and sanctification which again is a work of the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost wooing you and calling you and convincing you of wrongdoing and and tell you you know get rid of this and that out of your life you know sanctification which again work of the Holy Ghost we're by the professor by the possessed by the knowledge of the word begins to be lost it's still just a work of the Holy Spirit is the Holy Spirit wooing and calling you saying come on in but you're not in man you you're making step toward it but they're not in the lap a man is calling you there but you're not there yet all right you say brother Tim that's me today well I tell you you you've got a choice you can take another step toward the promised land you can move on in come on and then we're calling for immigrants to make their allele and then that Aliyah means a homecoming to come in a rector enough we're going up on decision rising higher thoughts calling you to make your Aliyah today to come into that Promised Land come on home come on you're weary those that have been distressed those that are been cast down those that have been abused whatever you are you you know come on there there's refuge there is peace there is joy there is prosperity there ever blessing in the homeland come on in the homeland that's what the Holy Spirit is calling hey ma'am and if you're in the homeland then the Holy Spirit is calling you take some more of it get more than what you got yeah you're there you're in the homeland but you know face your giants and then take your possession are you with me now so so again again let's take it one step further we talked about confession of faith or justification and sanctification which is again a work of the Holy Ghost I'm a you know but and then to be baptized by the spirit that one is so overjoyed that they speak in other languages is still but a work of the Spirit it is not the Holy Ghost it is a gift of the Holy Ghost so you don't to get to have tongues are you with me is there is to receive his gift but we're not about receiving a gift today we're talking that you must have the very person the very life of Christ in your life amen now so joy again you know that it's two is a portion now person can do all of this you mean justified and sanctified or speak in other tongues and dance and shout and still not have the indwelling of the Spirit of God you see it's like you know conception in the womb is faith and the growth of the baby and sanctification in the womb but it must receive the breath of God again you know that the dry bones that I preach them out here the other day of you weeks ago you know I did just have the sinew bring them together or just have the flesh come upon them doesn't make them alive remember breathe o breath of God breathe upon deed that comes damn that become a mighty army that's what we're preaching about amount of people receiving that life so they can be a mighty army so you can defeat the demons in your life hey ma'am you can defeat the demons in its pledge of families through the years and then you can defeat the enemy and you can walk in victory that's what that's what our goal is not just to be a church but to be a victorious church what without spot or wrinkle one that is united with him now so person can do all of this and not out that indwelling of the Spirit of God is like I said like conception faith you know that's where it's conceived growth of the baby and sanctification like in the womb but it's got to receive the breath of God and being dwell by the spirit and this birth is more than a conception in the womb it's more than just accepting Jesus as your personal Savior and making the confession with your mouth and start your your belief it's more than believing in the saying you know I really think the message is right what you got the Holy Ghost know you have a work of the Holy Spirit that is teaching you to believe amen now so the birth takes place though when life comes in to the soul and overshadows and quickens the seed that is in yourself now this is why brother Branham would tell you the real gift is your soul because if you don't have a seed germ of life on the inside no matter how much the rain of the Holy Spirit comes there ain't nothing inside there to quicken but praise God I can see people right here in this building today that have been quickened by the Holy Ghost proven there was a seed on the inside of them amen now so when this birth takes place when light comes into the and quickens our and the seed within the soul it does it live what life is the literal life of Jesus Christ so this is what we're preaching about is the age of that literal life of Jesus Christ not a tongue a gift not a not a cleansing the washing of sanctification not a justification a giving you of a new set of beliefs but more than that the receiving of the very life the very life that was in Jesus the very spirit that was in Jesus comes and indwells you a map now of course it starts with faith you're not going to get anything from God unless you start believing you're not only got to believe the Bible said he that cometh to God must believe that he is a man now why is it important to know that he is because if you believe he was but not today then you got the Holy Ghost yesterday and not today but we got to believe that it's for us today that he is that he'll keep its word that he's ever-present hey man that he's right there come on somebody there's a man and and that he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him so if you'll seek Him diligently he's going to reward you so he that come to God must believe that he is and I'm gonna be rewarded for believing and the reward for believing is receiving his life in the mind amen now again we we take this back to a little statement brother Branham said at birth pains he said now her messenger is promised in Malachi the fourth chapter he promised to do it and the message is to bring back the word bring the people back to the word birth is to be she is to be doing of a new birth from according to Malachi 4 so I want you to understand that the new birth of Malachi 4 is something that turns the heart hey man it doesn't work in the heart not something that you just jump about not something you just shout about though you may do all of that but whatever it does it turns the heart a man and when the hardest turn then the nature of God is projected toward God and for his word amen now so the new birth according to Malachi 4 it turns a heart away from sin and unbelief back to faith and that is more than a baptism of the Holy Ghost that just happens on your spirit round then see you're a three-part beat you are you have a body you have a spirit human spirit and then you have a soul amen now a lot of people get it where is that on their spirit and and they jump in the shower rejoice because that's where the human emotions lay and you can feel the Holy Ghost and that causes you to react it should cause you to react and I'll just say this you know sometimes people are worried about getting it on the spirit if you don't get it in your spirit you'll never get it in yourself hey man there's got to come through that Inlet and man has got to come to this hearing or seeing receiving a man through there through the outward man into the inward man of the Spirit the mind of the other person it must be accepted in the womb of the mind and then come into the self hey man so you see that again it is more than just coming down on your spirit round that this is what it is so deceiving in this age it is because people can actually get the Holy Ghost on their spirit and their soul remain unchanged this is why we could have men like on you know hey Alan who could who could cast out Devils have a tremendous prayer line and many times be drunk on alcohol while he is doing this is because if it was it could get on his spirit and anointing there and there he would pray even for the sick and God without her faith and the epitope me you know brother Brendan said about until he said God would honor that faith he said even if I was a hypocrite and that's what people don't understand a lot of times that God who responds to faith for healing it's faith and when God sees faith if you're a prostitute God will heal you but that itself don't save you there's a many people get healed that are never saved now so you see um again it's more than it's more than just something on your spirit ground that causes you to even make an intellectual response or profession to accept and believe you you know listen church i was i've watched on some films of a billy graham and make an altar call what is an anointing Tim twenty thousand moved down from the stands all in unison coming to accept Christ as a personal Savior and you say that wasn't anointing that was anointed a man wasn't a call of the Holy Ghost yes it was a call of the Holy Ghost hey ma'am but but again again you know they come and only went so far just to respond to accept Christ as our personal Savior and believe on Him as Lord and make a confession with their mouth but you see they fail to understand that you receive the Holy Ghost not when you believe but after you believe and that's what a lot of message guys had come along and made the same mistake they thought by embracing the truth of the message and acknowledging the Word of God was right and sympathizing with in the agreein and magazine yeah it makes more sense than anything and I know it's right and I know it's the truth but you see it's gotta be more than that it's gotta change it you there's a many of our young men that are raised up in church can sit on a barstool and out debate all of others other people in the bar they're not saved they just got knowledge and the knowledge didn't give them salvation the knowledge just puffed them up and they got a little more understanding that then the next guy um can can even win the debate but they're not saying we're not talking about being able win debates we're about being saved that no debater can take it away from you hey ma'am now you know you know I'm myself I'm not the smartest cookie on the tray and there's a lot of men cannot argue me here out debate me that doesn't mean anything I've got a revelation in my heart that the devil can't take away that all the arguments and the better the better way of presenting something can never change my mind I know because it happened to me amen I know because something changed me now again you see it's more than a baptism of the Holy Ghost that gives you an intellectual response or it's more than an emotional response rejoicing and shouting and dancing or speaking in tongues it's got to be the quickening of the sea gene of God that turns your life around now this is where it is so close that it would receive the very life you know where many times people are looking out here and saying how the Catholics they're there so they're not so close it would to see the very let the denomination they're not so close it would deceive the very elect if it were possible where is the real deception you just put up Matthew 24:24 but remember if we remember it so close because we're we're in the time we're in the time of of the grain and in that stage there's another stage they're called the shock and it's looked so much like the grain that you can mistake it for the grain your mouth now but it's the time their self-worth so close that people can actually sit on message pews and be deceived now I'm not trying to I'm not trying to shake you I'm not trying to remove your anchor I'm trying to get you to realize hey you know I I just need to move further in God hey Mount Matthew 24:24 for there shall arise false Christ's now he didn't say false Jesus's he says false Christ's Christ means Anointed One there shall rise people that are anointed now what makes it so confusing it's just like aaand it he was not healing by the devil he was healing by the power of Christ so you see they can absolutely actually be truly anointed but unchanged on the inside they can actually speak in genuine Holy Ghost tongues and not have the person of Christ on the inside they can actually prophesy and it come to pass campuses did amen Balaam did prophesy and he come to pass and still be an anointed by the true spirit yet be false heed see anointed ones at the end time this is this is where it gets really really tricky I want you to get this now because this shut looks so much like the grain you we come at this stage where there's two parts and one looks so real and is not real and the other is real grain and it's the only one gonna go in the gardener this shucks gonna be burned with unquenchable fire amen and let me just say let me just say um there's been many shock city no message pews why do you think why do you think they pulled away from the grain what do you think that went right back out into the world what do you think that but we made him deacons and trustees and preachers and so now they deny the message because they look so real that it was so difficult to tell him apart that churches would even elect them as the Deacons in the church this look like the most spiritual one above us and all they were was a shock amen now I know you're thinking this is really hard but you know let me let me do say in the natural the shuck can never become the grain but in the spiritual if you're shucked this morning you can become grace amen you you may have been a cane all your life and man you may have been a Judas in a betrayer but today you can change to be a son of God hey ma'am as exactly right it meant so you know maybe - maybe you know even Kane was given an opportunity and we were given err we're holding everybody else out an opportunity don't they they you say well brother Jim them people when they left they blaspheme will Paul said I blaspheme Dan I persecuted so we don't ever give up on anybody we say who's ever will let him come you and repent come on a man the spirit beings come come on get in get in the arms of safety I don't care you man for years through your Tomatoes no I'm for years you through your dropping eggs you slandered and you did all of that but whatever put a ballot get in the ark he said why are you preaching that way because many of you have got loved ones that are out there that have done exactly that and I'm giving you some hope for them you said why would you give them hope because God does theirs example after example a man of wavered men and women prodigal sons and then that went out and wasted it all and God brought him back here in spite of us and I'm gonna tell you I'm not gonna be an older son that sits around and criticize I'm gonna be one of those that said let's have a party let's have a celebration let the children I don't know I don't know you kill the fatted calf come on home children I believe we got a fatted calf right here so well the chapters all burn well you know said well that's all in denominators everyone I'm out there they're gonna be burned now there's some of them that are saved for a different purpose they may be outside of the city and the New Jerusalem to come but they will be there amen don't listen to quit trying to play God and put people in and out just just let God be God let God making their decisions and you do what the bride does the spirit and the bride say come and whoever is thirsty come and drink of the water of life freely so you let not be God and you be bride any man causes fear and the bride will say come a man that's what gives me hope that's why I can preach service after service knowing some of you are backslidden some of you are rebellious some of you are you know are just barely hanging on but I always hope this will be the service that today will be the day and then today could be your day will you come all the way into the land where there's an Aliyah for you where there's a celebration and there's a bunch of brothers and sisters right in here that's a come on in come on in this promised land cut off I found that's what I proved for you there from that root ball and we can't go the Messiah can't come until every one of his as in the land hallelujah [Applause] hey man that's what I would do I would say amen to that I'd say Amen from my loved one for my brother for my sister for my children for my children's children and man whereas many are is a far off how far they stray I would say do it Soviet God right here in this land there be a revival and a place prepared to receive those wayward women that they can come in and find grace and mercy [Applause] hallelujah Mathew 24:24 that's Christ now thoughts I know anyone so know anyone now a lot of people get that off you know messed up because we read the title to false anointed ones at the end time that brother Branham would tell us in that sermon the anointing is true so it's it's really anointed false ones true anointed false ones a man the anointing is true now quit making fun of the anointing out there you know while I'm here it just struck me quit making fun of the anointing out there yeah you don't people people to say well you know all these people and these praise and worship songs and they're all about love and they seem sensual what do you think's going on there's a marriage of the Lamb there's a bride and a groom coming together it's the time of a love affair don't make fun of the anointing they are catching listen those are gifts those are gifts and God even gives gifts to the rebellious and they can operate I'm going to give my ala ala did and they can sing even wrong songs and come back and get anointed and write us a wonderful song like that song that I heard when I was just an 11 year old boy set on the edge of my seat in Shreveport Louisiana and here brother Brandon write us another verse to a secular song a country hit high on the pop charts a contemporary song are you with me and been popular out there where everybody had popularized it now since 1958 on the wings of a snow white dove and see the Holy Spirit come down and write another verse to it where did they get the inspiration because as we're going to be a part out take a drunk man a drunken rebellious man all his life one day break into an anointing write a song I saw the light he wrote it under that moment of catching a glimpse of light went right back out into darkness we sing songs like pledge allegiance to the lamb turn around and God turns around becomes a homosexual denies everything how in the world could he write such an inspired song anointed don't call the anointing false the anointing is true is the person's as fault and don't tell me we we can't sing those songs and worship to God because they are our love songs back to Christ amen and if you get in love with Jesus you what happen problems with [Applause] you start pouring out your heart empresa was about so amen now which in how can overcome brother branham said we see this age that we're living in it's one of the grandest ages of all age now for I go on I want you to understand I don't put a stamp of approval and leave a song this out there hey ma'am I think I think it's got to be under some holy ghost leadership and I believe we have it at this church but we see this age that we're living in it's one of the grandes ages of all ages this Laodicean Church age is the grandest of all the church ages because it's the ending of time and the blending of eternity and then now here it's the grandest because ages are indignant and an eternity is blending amen and this Laodicean age grandis of all ages is the climax age is the final age God won't speak in another age so if you got another age God ain't speaking there because this is the last voice this is the amount of God this isn't finished this is a finality if you don't get it by the seventh angels message you're not going to get it so again then it is the greatest sinful age the grandest blending of time and eternity the one who receives the greatest rewards brother Branham said of all the other agents Laodicea and yet the greatest sinful age it's more sin in this age then there's ever been and the powers of Satan is many times harder to fight against then it wasn't any age see here back in the earlier ages of Christian good for his profession of an immature I belong in the Christ could be beheaded for it he can be killed and put out of his misery and go to meet God quickly you know again you know early age just make a you know just professor's name you can be killed for it but now the enemy has come in in the name of the church and it's so deceiving this is the great age of deception when Christ said so the two spirits would be so close in the last days till it would deceive their very intellect if it was possible remember Christ spoke of an elected people for the last days say it would deceive the very elect if it was possible aren't you glad you spoke about an elected people in the last days here we are mama that's me that elected people a man and I would be deceived by if it were possible but you see with this personal life of Christ you can't be to see because this bride is going to be different from what Eve was she will not be to see a man the people now here's where it comes down it is so close the people so live people can live a clean holy life and not be sinful adulterers and drinkers and liars and gamblers and they can and they can live above that and still not with it oh my goodness brother Tim you mean a people that live a clean holy life they're just really good people and they're not sinful like being adulterers yeah man this guy he's faithful to his wife you know um it drinkers he wouldn't touch alcohol wires he's just as honest he could be so squeaky clean gamblers wouldn't be that you won't catch him down at casinos they can live above that and still not with it and then he says this is the age of life personal life of Christ that's where I got my title a man that were the chemical of his body what was in him first under justification the water baptism second under the new birth of Wesley's sanctification which cleanses thirdly under the baptism of the Holy Spirit putting that sanctified vessel into service the word sanctify means is a compound Greek word with means cleaned and set aside for service set aside for service now the Holy Spirit puts it in service and will notice when the whole when the unclean spirit is going from a man he walks in dry places that's exactly what the church is done that's exactly what the church is done Baptist Methodist those who believe in st. vacation that Jesus said the unclean spirit went out returns back into this church body and finds a house garnished and swept clean and living pure and clean lives but then if that house isn't field occupied then he comes in with seven other evils demons worse than he was and the last stage of the mud this place is seven times worse than it was in the first place they'd have been better to say Luzerne than to receive that light and failed to follow it so will the Pentecostals see you know what I mean the house is garnished so again so close now the devil comes in and they're live so clean holy church members and still unsaved and the message investment he took it a little further he said a beautiful picture jesus said when when the unclean spirit is coming out of the man did you notice he never said when he's cast out of a man but when he goes out by his own will when the unclean spirit is going out of a man and it turns back to this man and finds the house that he's lived in has been swept and garnished and he goes and gets seven other devils and demons unclean spirits and innocent to this man and the last fate of this man is seven times worse than it was at the verse did you notice the devil went out by his own will and he returned by his own will you know this is what brother Branham would say Satan don't care how right you are in your doctor as long as you miss sabbith so he'll even let you sit on a message pew all right a mite he'll he'll let you just even come right down the place and the devil go out by his own will and come back with seven more and you become a religious person just religious and you'll watch them a lot of times these are time bombs that are just about you know they may go 10 years and all of a sudden they explode they're like a terrace let us assail sitting right there in the church and then they explode here goes you know there are dull trees and I thought that man oh he sang in the choir my goodness he was a a preacher he did this and he explodes and how many does he take down with him we've seen it time on time again hey man it's a very picture beautiful picture of a moralist as we would think of today a man that tries to think he's going to heaven just because he couldn't gamblin or even maybe quit running with women that wasn't his wife or stopped his drinking on New Year's Day and turned over a new leaf and joined the church you see he doesn't he really isn't converted he's just a more or less and the devil he's using more or less just to go out and make a foolish representation when really the real power of the Living Christ isn't there so this is what we want to have is that the real power of the Living Christ not just church members hey ma'am the world is wanting to see Christ Jesus said I'm the vine you are the branches and the branch bears record of the vine because it draws its energy and life from the vine still reading from investments well the first vine first branch came from this vine they wrote a book of Acts behind that branch we see the way the Holy Spirit acted in that first church and that church of Pentecost and then when we believe that if this original vine that ever puts forth another branch they'll write another book of Acts behind it because it's the same life that's in the vine and if the first branch put forth a bunch of grapes and then we find it out here that's got watermelons growing on it and pumpkins and cucumbers we know it isn't the life that was in the vine therefore I think even where we would call ourselves Pentecostals have failed to represent the real thing that Christ has set forth for us to represent the Holy Spirit and the life of that spirit see we sometimes we represent sometimes sensations and we represents joy and that's good but there's more to it than that there's a fruit that goes with it that hungry man is looking for this fruit of the Spirit and this is a quality that was in Jesus so we want the same quality that was in Jesus to be in us his life on display that's why brother Brandon when he preaches the message token he said that token to be effective must be on display hey Matt what is the token is too literal I'm the Christ his life must be on discipline now you see it takes more than an anointing or baptism on your human spirit you can have that and this is what brother Brandon would so confuse people especially the Pentecostals who relying on speaking in tongues he's you know he said you can have that every day of your life and still be lost but when the Holy Ghost comes in your soul it becomes your nature and we're looking for the life of Christ to be on display you said what am I looking for brother Tim you know to jump well you know you don't make you jump but there's a lot of people jumping gotta know hey man hey shout yeah it'll make you shout but a lot of people shouting ain't got a thing some are shouting to get it then you know the shout to get it you shout cuz you got it amen now certainly certainly you know you've got to yield to the spirit not saying that you've got to yield to the spirit you got you've got to invite the Holy Spirit to come into your life do a work hey ma'am but but you see what are we looking for that fruit that that evidence that he's there because his life is there and you can get in on your spirit every day of your life and still be lost but that Holy Ghost must come into your soul and become your nature and so we're looking for his life to be on display now of course you know if his life is on display you can't deny any word he cannot then I'm self see you can't have the Holy Ghost and deny his word you can't have the Holy Ghost and say don't speak in tongues no more you can't have the Holy Ghost and say days of miracles are past you can't have the Holy Ghost and cut your hair and paint your face you just came he said well I believe the message do you apparently don't you still may use a makeup so you don't believe if you believe we'd show the actions you see here your actions would would would actually demonstrate what you really believe and it wouldn't be a struggle on the inside it would be a change of nature it'd be a desire to please God so well I don't understand that you wouldn't even have to understand it all you have to know is God said this and that's good enough for me but I understand it or not why how come it doesn't really matter he said it you see what we're looking for is the deity of Christ to come in you not a profession of faith not quit drilling quit smoking or drinking or you know reform here and there and straighten up here and there and we're looking for that of course we're looking for you to believe on Christ - we're looking for forever ever promised God house but what we're looking for is his life to be on display amen so in the deity of Christ you just go right back to that fundamental message all the way back to 49 brother Brenneman's adamant about this from the beginning all the way down to the end but he said that is God the Creator living in you and give you all the powers and you're in possession of anything that he had so it is so it is so is it in you to abstain from evil to do good to shun evil and to flee to righteousness to turn away from temptation all malice hatred strife envy and so forth turn away from it for that to take him from your heart if you receive him embrace him love him hold him in your heart and love I can tell you the church together in that kind of a power has the power to bind the heavens heal the sick open the eyes of the blind hallelujah that that dumb to speak and the depth to hear the cripples to walk and the blind to see why it's recognizing the power of Almighty God into your heart there he is the deity hey man now the whole point the whole point in all of this teaching that brother Branham does about adoption and then he appreciably hidden life with Christ and the outer veiled in turmoil and the most holy and all these the whole point the whole point is he's trying to get everybody to understand you must come to full turn you must receive it and that's fullness parcel isn't good enough so adder bail isn't good enough Intervale isn't good enough you got to come into the Holies of Holies but come into that a little more again you recumbent I'm starting from infancy and learn and then being under the tutor of the Holy Ghost and finally come to adoption once this point the hosts point is full term God wants his church to come into his fullness not partial fullness hey man so brother dim this is so elementary well I'll tell you what you get the you get the fullness you'll love elementary sermons like this I'm not you won't be sitting up there puffed up with knowledge and said we know all of this you'll be saying Lord God pour out even more amen so you know the whole point has come to full time whether the type is water blood and spirit remember that's the three stages of the new birth water blood spirit you know there that's an the natural birth is a type of the spiritual birth these three elements of the birth filter coming from emphysema adoption once again full-term that's the whole point of the whole thing coming from the outer court today enter court to the most holy coming from all the way full turn alright so using either either the type of water blood and spirit or using the allegory of a child coming to adoption the whole inferences is coming to full turn now I'm going to explain something to you this is Sunday morning and I'm going to just take a moment and explain a couple of things to you about types we in this message we use a lot of types types are okay as long as they make the same point the Prophet makes a man we come to a different conclusion brother Branham then brother Branham had or the Bible has with him we or we come to wrong conclusions because you can type yourself right out of the Word of God and people are doing it but but being that we're talking about adoption outer court enter court most holy all these are types water blood and spirit it's a type the natural types the spiritual now but you can't mix the types you got to keep them running correctly and you got to know exactly how to apply them let's just take the life of Abraham for a moment Abraham is a perfect type brother branham said perfect type of the bride so he also divine calls that's justification then he comes to the blood altar where he teaches him how to worship that sanctification he teaches a a comes and brings him to else a di and and on to you know God standing in a human flesh Elohim discerning the heart the thoughts and intents of Sarah's heart in the body change so you see we can see we can type in the life of Abraham all the way from justification the change of our bodies is everybody with me come all the way from them from justification believing on the Lord to to sanctification the God a blood altar to El Shaddai aya the drinking from the breast of God and then all the way to the change of our body type it all the way but after Abraham you know is changed and Sarah is a young woman Abraham lies now let's take it a little further not only does he lie but after after Sarah is changed she dies now then not only does that happen but then Isaac and then Abraham or they will go up to Mount Moriah and Abraham has the hardest trial of his life you mean to tell me that after we're justified sanctified baptisms upon baptized with the Holy Ghost and our bodies are changed and we've received the promised son and after that we go through the hardest change of our life and we're still lying and still dying no that's not true you you've taken your type too far you gotta know in the beginning when the end it for to work properly it's a type a type is a shadow a shadow doesn't tell all the details it just gives you an idea of what's coming hey man sometimes a shadow can actually look like you've got like right now I can see almost 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 I don't have nine fingers but I can see that many because the way the lights hitting it so you've got to know when to begin your type and what what out of that type to take to make it work right all right now then now then you can't mix types now let's get this lesson in tight over with so did you get it you can't mix the types you got to keep your types running in the line together are you with me for example brother Branham would type the bride as a virgin who is going to a wedding and and he would type her a virgin bride going to a great wedding in disguise you can find this in the quotes he would also type the bride and it's more often that he would use this type but he would type the bride errs married and already pregnant with his life and then going away to a wedding supper in the skies already having conceived the life all right now that's good both types are wonderful their truths but don't mix this type or you have a bride who is unmarried and already pregnant none of it married so you either type it this way or type it that way but you don't mix the types all right now the same here we got two types about the new birth we have water blood and spirit it constitutes a full-term birth is that right so the whole idea is full-term what's ours it come into full turn coming to maturity coming to life and then the other type is adoption which we were reading about here in Galatians and that is advancement of a childhood adulthood and they're both talking about the same thing that means they you know coming from two adoption is the same as advancing from the infant beginning to meet the conditions of adulthood and becoming a full-fledged son so the whole ideas full turn a man so now again again full term now we got two types we got water blood and spirit and then it it brings us to the full type of the fullness the Holy Ghost coming in its fullness you're full born child a man so this is showing you football God lies this other I here is starting in its infancy and coming to football or full-fledged God lies but you don't mix the types or else you are handing a baby an infant baby a set of keys and say son go run the car because you're mixing two types but if you keep on running correctly how many's understanding me now did you come to both them are reaching the same conclusion coming to full term coming to fullness hey man this is what he was doing with a the very thing you are using the type of the of the inner court our court most holy come into bonus coming it coming to the completion now so again this is these have got to be defended right or else you get the whole I too confused so well you're saying I'm adopted when I get the Holy Ghost and and I'm a baby no you using the type you're not a baby when you receive the Holy Ghost you're a full-glitz son will fled son now operating as the Son of God and this is what he was saying when you receive the spirit you are no more a servant a child but now you are a son I'm operating in the kingdom of God this is Bible the way Paul used adoption now now how do you come to full term when or when using the type of the three stages of the birth water and blood and the spirit how do you how do you accomplish that well the same way Peter told us in acts 2:38 repent every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so how do you come to the whole time acts 2:38 hey Matt now how do we get adopted or place his sons and the promised land of the Holy Ghost same way Peter told us same thing amen repent be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sin and I receive the gift of the Holy Ghost hey man so it's the same way the church at Pentecost was fully empowered adopted church were the abstract of the title deed but was chosen to be planted as a seed whereas this mature grain and our day is going to be raptured or taken into the garner that's the only difference you say well we had the seals brother Tim well yeah we had the sealed but they didn't need the seals it wasn't sealed to them you tell me tell me one one to one fundamental doctrine a man that would that power that we preach that Paul didn't preach and man what was this about the seven seals it was it was showing us how we got off track and bringing us back to what Paul preached not an inner gospel that same gospel because it would preaching another gospel we're cursed like I said you know when we're starting to come to conclusions today the lamb has left the mercy seed and there's no more intercessor and he's no longer the high priest and the blood you know is not needed and there's no need for a sacrifice that is a lie and it's not what Paul preached and everyone who believes that increases that is accursed and the only way to come out from under that curse has come out of that unbelief because that's what it is now so again brother Branham would would would preach on something and and and he would preface this scripture we're going to look back at Galatians 4 and verse 4 and and he would he would preface this by saying now comes our triumphal capstone on the baptism with the Holy Ghost so here brother Branham laying it down here's our triumphal caps on the baptism with the Holy Ghost and he reads from glaces for for but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption and son and because you are sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father whereby wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ so notice the adoption that is God sending forth the spirit of his son Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost in your heart then that makes you recognize God is your father yea man this is this is your new birth and man when you recognize God is your father Galatians 4:1 let's look at that scripture again now let's say that the heir as long as he's a child he differs nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all notice child servant child servant child servant as long as he's a child he's a servant he is not in sonship as long as he is a child not but notice this once the Holy Ghost is coming to come by God sending forth the spirit of his son in your heart what's that happen look at verse 7 now wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ hallelujah so once the Holy Spirit comes in your tallulah servant you're a full-fledged son you've got the adopted robe you've got the father's approval you got is ring on your finger you can do whatever you bind is bound whatever you hire is hired whatever you fire is fired what have you cast up Kevin stands behind you you are a son of God with authority from God hey man there it is I'm gonna quote from the church age book Jesus Christ came forth died upon the cross an accomplice Redemption restored to original owner by the means of a purchase and paying the price and thereby placed us his sons he did not make us sons because we were already his sons but he placed us as sons notice the Holy Ghost is placing you into the land place and you into the body they man placed us this is why brother Brandon would say he would place you as a preacher I meant like cuz you really can't to preach till the Holy Ghost comes and man this is what positions you as a son or daughter of God a man so when the Holy Ghost comes he did not make us sons for we were already his sons but he places his sons for as long as we were in the world in the flesh we cannot be recognized as his sons we were held captive by the devil now really let's get something straight you didn't really become a son when you made a profession of faith no that's not when you become as you always were a son you were son before the world began you shouted as the stars of God you rejoiced he saw you in his mind rejoicing right here in time rejoicing over the enemy he saw you doing just what you're doing right there brother David James Ray's on your hands and st. glory to God you were there and you're here doing what he saw you do in eternity hallelujah amen so therefore when you recognize the very word of God was eagle who you heard from your theophany you heard from what he saw of you before the world began and you are only here in time doing what you did in eternity and by the way you were predestinated unto adoption and he set your destiny to receive the Holy Ghost to receive his nature for the Holy Spirit to come in your heart whereby you cry Abba Father Abba it's just say arabic word for father's father father my father my god when yous out in the world sports was your god women was your God men were your God Hollywood was your God you had many gods but here when you come into this lamb we have one Lord one God one father in this land we don't have many gods we have one God hey Matt so now he did not make us sons for we were already his sons but he placed us as his son for as long as we were in the world in the flesh we could not be recognized as his sons we were held captive by the devil but not we were sons nevertheless and hear this and because you are sons God has sent for the spirit of his son into your hearts whereby you cry father father of whom whom did the spirit fall at Pentecost sons at Corinth upon sons when they heard the word hey mom and when the Holy Ghost came that put them in the body of Christ that put them or placed them in the land that's hold brother branham's whole sermon on the adoption is being pasted into the promised land now so in the end this morning church age he would even say what is the baptism with the Holy Ghost it is a spirit baptizing you into the body of Christ now this is why we believe you can't join the church you have to be baptized into it by the Holy Ghost amen so you might be born here dedicated here sit on the pew but you never truly belong until you're born again and you know until that happens you're always gonna have this sense of alienation you're gonna always have this sense I don't fit you're always gonna have this condemnation well I'm not worthy to take communion so you don't show up in communion well you know that's not the answer dance does not quit church does not quit communion the answer is get born-again resolve the issue get the strange feeling away from you can you get to where you you realize this is my homeland I am no stranger in this homeland I belong here hey ma'am now again um it's the spirit baptizing you into the body of Christ it is the new birth in his spirit the Living God coming in you again he would say in the message leadership and I think this is important hold on real close everybody listen listen up you've got to face one thing eternal life that's everybody here and there's only one person who can give that to you mama can't give it to you so you can raise you right and the Holy Spirit can use her and and and daddy to be the tutor to teach you what's right and wrong but all it will do is it is just a schoolmaster to keep you until you receive Christ hey man now like here's through they straight from the law they went out and they took other gods and they went a whoredoms and what you can do all of that under the rule of your mom and dad every time they're not looking you're flipping through pornography every time they're not looking you're doing things you know it's not right you go to school you change your clothes and you got your lipstick your dress comes oh I know since I was 15 I've free preached against women wearing the wearing short dresses and only have some goes to school and I stay out shoulder Timmy and pull their dresses their skirt all the way up so have to tie what is it you know again you need a new birth that's the problem because we can't give you the Holy Ghost mama can't Papa can't give it to you listen this your posture can't give it to you your leader here can't give it to you everybody that gets eternal life has got to come to Jesus Christ he's the only one who can give that part your teacher can give you an education she can teach you you have to learn it your mother can teach you to walk you have to learn to walk your father can teach you how to be a businessman or what you have to learn that but only Jesus can give you turn life your priest your leader and so forth can teach you your religion hold on your seats now you can learn the message that we are trying to teach but still that won't give you eternal life you've got to accept the person Jesus Christ you understand that all of you you gotta accept the person Jesus Christ to have eternal life hey man so it's the age of the personal life now early in the 1950s brother Branham was telling the Azusa Street the full gospel movement that something more was needed than what they had received over and over again he will use different illustrations but the point is the same dad would find us they thought they'd achieved it the Baptist thought they did it when they believe this isn't Methodist thought they did it when they got sanctified and sadly the Pentecostal thought they had all of it when they spoke in tongues and brother Branham over and over and over again is dealing with the people who say yeah when fired up you're not so tired so he'll you use different illustrations so the year 1956 you know what 1956 was it was a year of their Jubilee 50 years 1906 1956 and brother branham's message throughout that year was a hidden life with Christ and he he would use the types of the three courts he taught that although they had received the manna which he typed as the Holy Spirit that they hadn't gone into the holiest of Holies where the pot of manna never gives out and the believer who dwells there never suffers the meal cramps or ever hungers again and that behind the curtain he sealed away from the world so this is what he was saying he said you know I'm not saying you don't have mana he said Mather fell on the outer courts Madeleine would even they would have a pot of man art or other some shewbread in the inner court but it had to be changed out all the time but he said in the holiest of Holies where the word were in in that place he said they had part of mana that never got stale that never then you know that the believer there never had to suffer milk rounds hit in other words he didn't know it a revival and then lose what he got there have to go to another revival wait for the spirits of all again and wait for the spirit of all again and get another bite to eat make it on to the next meeting then they know once he was in that holiest of Holies he ate the original manner that was poured out on the day of Pentecost hallelujah the same original manner and there in that whole list of holy he never got hungry again well he always had a hunger but it was right there every matter he never had to go hunting out again he never felt the empty again are you with me he was satisfied he was filled with the spirit the pot of manna was the cicada glory was there instead of outside here and you know you have sunlight on the outer court it's like great light a bright shining light but at night you ain't there and in the time of cloudy days is dark and dismal you don't feel its warmth his light then he said the next court was it was like there too and he said it was from the seven golden candlesticks which is the light of the messengers but the light of the messengers is leading you are making the way of shining the light for you to come into the holiest of Holies and he said but the problem with that sometimes it would forget to put the oily in different times the lamps would go out they would gets muddy and smoky and it was a good light but he said he of the inner court was this kind of glory and that light never went out whether it was stormy outside and cloudy and whether it was low is nighttime no matter what it was always there the Shekinah glory was always there man the light never got them and went out it didn't it didn't depend on the refilling it was always there it didn't have to be pumped up and warped out and pressed out and squeezed out and then get this oil out of this and putted that know it was there there's a category there all the time Pilate Madden never failed and he said to the Vale come and shut the world off and this is what he's saying Pentecost Baptists Methodists you got mana you got the Holy Ghost but you ain't went far enough you got light but it ain't the perfect light you know you got mana but it ain't it ain't the hidden manna the whole point of it was full time fullest and being sealed away from the world the problem he found was believers couldn't make it from revival to revival they would backslide before the next survival and although you know in the outer court they you know was light but then would come darkness and the light would be gone cloudy days of discouragement would block the light the inner court the problems the same they have lighted candle sticks we get smoking them so all of this you know but there is a place this is what we're trying to preach the age of the life you see the Chi kind of glory was God it wasn't leading you to God it was God and that's what we're preaching about you know not a step toward God not a jerk to the lab but if the line now the next night service after brother branham presa they that anniversary service he says he preached the next night was why I think Pentecost failed well can't you imagine how angry that made the Pentecostals to tell them why I think you failed and then this sermon he teaches that the churches are predestinated to adoption and the Pentecost is stopped short of it was still a child that needed to grow up and for this he uses the example of the Roman custom of adoption now that a Roman would adopt a son and his family then the son would be born in his family during the years of child-rearing the the the son would be under a governor or tutor but when adopted he would be a mature son an adult who had proved that he had been an achiever and that he proves that worthy of sonship and inherited his father's possession and this young man had been raised and tutored and proved by his behavior that he was worthy of sonship this was this was the Roman custom of adopting an adult son into the family as a business administrator and the ceremony would include recognition of a new robe that signified his positioning or a ring that the signified is authority to act in his father's name and it continues his concept in the adoption series in 1960 and he uses his same custom of the Romans there and and the NT would show them how that you know the tutor was trying to give them to come to sonship and yet they that wasn't covered in this place where they were filled with the spirit where the spirit of a doctor came after although after all the holy ghost is the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father hey man it's the receiving of the Spirit of Christ in your life when he comes that's what adoption is I'm talking about Bible now mmm and at the end at this point it reaches a point were the food that where he's been under tutors and with we're here where he's come through his sanctification and he's learned the Father's will that God would fill him with the Holy Ghost would set him aside keep here the robe give him authority now brother Brennan would use this terminology the Roman custom - of adoption to illustrate the need of the church - to UM to progress in maturity yet he didn t Christianize them he just acknowledged the work that God had done in their lives world work of the Spirit but he was saying you you need something more and he he would he would talk about the the tutors effort to try to get these people spirit-filled people these that were claiming sphere field is the way I would say it claiming to be spirit field to come to a point that God could entrust them in the kingdom as a full-fledged son and you said that church will not come to adoption that won't come to maturity that will come hours away now remember without this adoption you're not going in the rapture I saw there the rupture the rupture is only for the adopted and the adopted is the spirit filled those who have the token it's all one in the same now so you know again brother Branham would talk about losers filled with the spirit math siddhis filled with the spirit Presbyterians filled with the spirit you know you know your son but you you need something more what you got is not even you're not even coming in to conduct you're not even coming to the please another father how is he ever gonna trust you with the kingdom and you won't behave you won't do what I say you won't surrender your own will you're determined to continue right on in your sinful lifestyle and yet claim the spirit and brother Brandon would talk about them you know being full of the Holy Ghost and he said when the Pentecost some people the Free Methodist and the Baptist and so when they received the Holy Spirit and said we got it that settles it but it didn't he said what did God was good but it wasn't enough he didn't condemn he didn't condemn the confessing Christ he didn't condemn them believin in sanctification living a holy life quit drinking smoking he didn't condemn that he believed in now he didn't condemn the Pentecostals weakened with kisses fear being said you're not going far enough you stopped short and so he was using this illustration of adoption to show them you haven't went far enough and because you refused to go further you will not inherit you might be a son and you might let me bring it to dead today's turn you may be on the outside of the city you may be a foolish virgin or you could wind up in hell but you're not going to carry the rapture without the Holy Ghost until you come to full time until you get a top bed you cannot go into rapture if you're not listening to the tutor trying to bring correction he can never trust you with his power power without characters satanic what's the result of aaand satanic just even millions let me tell you Janice and Jambres receive use the power of God to turn their staffs into serpents you think the devil can do that if he can he's a creator they use the power of God to do it but look what they use their power these impersonators use their power to try to keep the people in Egypt keep them in bondage and the power of Moses was to free the people from bondage and you look at all these other moves out there what was what did they use their gifts for it was to keep them in denominational enslavement this is Jennison jammers that withstood Moses has withstood even the prophet in the last day but look at what their motive is what they're doing with it in your life and you look a lot of even men with Holy Ghost gifts of preaching and preach like a house on fire and a high wind and you know make me look like a kindergarten kid but and these guys you know with great gifts and whatever they're like but look and see what they're doing quinta building denominationalism fooling people he fended themselves teachers having itching ears hey ma'am but brother Branson but how can the church the Pentecostal church some Methodists and the Baptist churches be adopted until they come to discipline if they won't hear the word how are they gonna ever be rapture ready if they won't lead the wilderness of sin how are they ever going to get in the Promised Land if there's Faisal here and Kate is Barnea there never look at the end they're tasting they're shouting they're doing all of this they say we're circumcised we're Jews we're seed of a ver have we're Christians but they're not going into the homeland now brother Branham would deal with these I started a little early so I could end a little late and if you're a little upset about that I got a few words for you so let's just get along with this there's some where we're going with this now here's why they were not receiving the dope brother branham would give the tutors report said the Holy Ghost is a tutor and he's working on these and he cannot get them into repentance so he'll work on him that's here now listen the tutor will use preachers he'll use other other sons and daughters of God would tell you the word but here's what he said they're marrying and giving in marriage that lots of the Deacons are married four or five times and still holding Deacons office do you notice the church had begun flipping about marriage yeah do you know do you know in our message ranks today there are polygamist who have more than one wives and use quotes to to back up their beliefs absolutely they are do you know there are adulterers in the pulpit that net that churches will let their pastor go right on into adultery and continue right on sitting there underneath do you know again again it's in the church we we have had homosexuals in the pulpit a man homosexuals in the church I believe him I believe that they can come to church they just need to be born again hey man it's no different than a prostitute out here is just reversion both of them verted lights but never done nevertheless let me tell let me tell you there's hope for you if you're in that condition because there is a deliverance but don't think you're a Christian and live in that kind of life man you know they're there again there's no earnest prayer given about this important life decisions until death do us part is still the order of the day all right but today we find there's no earnest desire to be the leader of the Holy Ghost and to realize young people you are to marry by revelation when brother Branham sums it all up in marriage and divorce he says you know he said if you married by revelation that's yours and and when you know married by revelation you're breaking the word but again it shows a laugh of the Holy Ghost in a person's life you're to marry by revelation the person you are taken to be your spouse is to be an eternal mate [Applause] and then brother madam turns his attention to those who are claiming the Holy Ghost and you are showing all this evidence they hadn't went far enough they need the father's approval and the Holy Spirit in their life and the tutor can't recommend them for adoption now these are the people that are supposedly spirit filled the brother brems that you need adopted he was telling him you need something more that to God and here's what he said the women are dressing and acting just like almost harlots on the street what Holy Ghost filled women your daughters that you gave the Holy Spirit I'm quoting oh they're dressing soem morally till they're making men on the street less for them church members come in and dressing in a seductive way it's a shame it's a shame enough for men they have to turn their head out here in the world but come in the house of God and have to turn their head and mom your daughters are wearing shorts your sons are permit me we'll get on the sons in a minute but yeah I'm just I'm just taking these snippets how they wear shorts and still addresses your daughters are dressing them morally women wearing these little bitty clothes it looks like man's clothes slacks or something they call them women in the summertime get out with a little bitty short clothes own that they often they even appear before their husband Ian and mow the yard and walk up and down the streets with those little clothes oh and you know what we're seeing on Facebook anymore all of these all of these message people out here dressed in lewd ways out on the bench on the beaches it ought to be the same and the men get out there and wear these shorts I'm not you know what I show it you don't have the Holy Ghost the tutor can't get you to full repentance hey man I'll turn the backyard with a little bit of hair a real dirty looking clothes don't call shorts mow in New York slacks is that what you call them do you know the Bible said is an abomination for a woman to put on a garment that pertains to man they have put on him more clothes those clothes that look like men that called them pedal pushers and slacks these are the people that brother branham is calling spirit-filled sons and daughters who need adoption why is he calling that because they have made professions of faith but they hadn't went all the way it's obvious the seal of God ain't there look at Grandma get some old pictures look at grandmother her long skirts braids of hair hanging down her back she wasn't so attractive to look look at the modern one today now we come to modern grandma modern grandma not modern teenage girl modern grandma let me tell you something let me tell you ladies sisters in this church grandmas you need you need to dress me as an example for the younger ones coming behind you hey man look at the modern grandma add a little skin down dress that ever formed she can't move without sinning walking tripping down the street with all the makeup and cosmetic a Max Factor can put on her nearly fixing her hair like some little girl wearing a little skirt just up about above her knees if you got on any at all but you look at her she's pretty Satan knows how to do it he's the author of beauty and that type of beauty which results in sin now God isn't against you being beautiful he's against you in having a portrayal of beauty that results in sin amen and sin is just crossing the word of God he would give an example and here you him he said in the view of this I wonder tonight if we the Pentecostal church that claims a new birth the Holy Spirit must blush when it comes in the presence of God to bring our character record on before the Father we call ourselves believers and we dilly-dally around the world the man that got away from God the women have got away from God it used to be in the old fashioned Church it was wrong for women to cut their hair Jenna they just as bobbed hair as the rest of the world it was wrong to wear this stuff on manicure or whatever you call it on their lips and mat now you think brother Branham was ignorant and stupid and whatever some people do because he calls it manicure you know we aren't we understand and he did to it that's you just on your fingers and nails but he's making a point and I'll tell you what you're being spiritually stupid for wear makeup don't think my prophets stupid you're being spiritually stupid to wear makeup hey man it's wrong you say wait wait wait wait and wait a minute brother Tim show me something in the Bible's and all you got in the Bible is that about Jezebel well I mean Jezebel put on makeup to vamp men and all you have to do oh you have to do is do a little bit of research on makeup and it's all about vamping men in fact I can read you the stats myself right here I've got them right in front of me there's studies that have been done they want the blush on the cheek and the redness on the lip to show that they are bleeding because that is the most likely time that women want to have a sexual relationship it is for the purpose of vamp and men now while I live my purpose and why are you doing it why do you want to even be like that hey mouth so you know but is it ye breaching cuz I'm just saying I don't care your Papa couldn't give you the Holy Ghost you mama couldn't do it and the pastor can't but you need a personal relationship with Jesus Christ that really changes your nature that makes you desire what God's Word sense that whatever I uh well brother Tim really now the reason why I wear it is cause I you know it it's just cuz I like it well okay so it's for your own self this is what the Bible said that there would be self lovers more than lovers of God this is a condition of the endtime world that we're living in and this shows that a person will not ever be adopted til they come to the place they hate saying like God hates her now so again in the Pentecostal women today oh well today the Pentecostal women wear shorts old vulgar little vulgar clothes and stand out and mow their yard oh brother there something's happened that's the old-fashioned brother it'll scour you out it's what the church needs is not so much of this Hollywood preaching we're having today but it's this old an old-fashioned revival in to sweep the country in the scour out the Church of God and that's the reason there wait a minute I'm gonna bring something down to you brother Brendan said that misbehavior one men member can cause a whole church to miserably fail miss Vega do you know the misbehavior of a woman who claims in a Christian and she she will dress and and do things that the Prophet spoke against and the Bible speaks against no way man you say you need but more Bible than Jezebel okay the Bible said that you should dressed in modest apparel but whatever you do it should be modesty and you can't call that modest win is for sex appeal I'm nailing it down but you might as well get it we've got to preach holiness if we're gonna have an adopted church and you're gonna have to believe in holiness if you're ever gonna be filled with the Holy Spirit he is not going to build your vessel and you still got desire for the world out here that's the reason we don't have miracles all-night prayer meetings and things that we used to have is because something's happen the Holy Spirit cannot bless we've had we've taken different teachers will we've not let the Holy Spirit do the teaching and how we get away with some little fancy slick tongue fellow didn't say oh that's old-fashioned don't believe in that but that's the teaching of the Bible or you say you're just old-fashioned brother branham the Bible is also and we're guilty before God if we neglect to preach the entire truth of that Bible my sister's the other day now here he comes and brings a point down the other day a young lady come to my house a beautiful woman sitting on the porch from my wife and I'd come in she was so dressed she looked terrible and she said brother branham excuse me but I I'm acting like this you know might woman I had to press my way in no words she's sitting on the porch waiting on him she was viewing herself like sooner my woman's you know and said what is it said I'd like to talk to you privately we went in the study I said okay sis what is it I said I thought she was a sinner she was dressed like one and she was a beautiful woman but just poured into a little dress it was terrible looking wasn't made for a woman to wear her now he said I'm not critical and I'm joking this is a pulpit and they say and the Bible the woman looked terrible and she kept telling me about how about her having nervous spells well he just happened to be I said well now first Danes sister what you need to do is accept Christ and she said I'm a Christian listen oh excuse me and I said she said yeah I'm a Christian said I got the Holy Ghost he said merciful father he said well lady you don't just like one then as he said oh you a year of the old school of thought this is 1957 we're that in the Pentecostal ranks they began to preach the liberation of women and so they were going to set the women free where they could listen I went through it with my cousins yeah we had Pentecost okay I had Pentecostal cousins that were pastors doubters that you know that that were wearing miniskirts in the 70s and makeup and cutting their hair you couldn't tell them from the world and their excuse was well how in the world you think we can be a witness and a light to people if we if we we dress like some old fogey well you know let me ask you something how in the world you think you're gonna be a light when you're darkness just like the rest of them a light stands out it's a beacon of the time of darkness and then that there is a holy God and a holiness hey ma'am and he said he said my pastor don't believe like that we got liberation of women he said you got liberation of something it's from the Bible you know you're that you've liberated yourself from me she said I said did anyone ever tell you you're an attractive woman and she kind of messed up her hair again on the south yes and you know do you realize that's a way that the way you dress you'll send more men there held and all the bar rooms in the country sees it what brother friend of my I don't mean anything and Bob God's grace here comes a basin and I see what she's doing so you work in an office yeah your mother's dead yeah you've got four sisters and a brother right he was lifting a fan around it hurts your back yeah if you put your hand back there and you'll find its source he said it is he said well right there he said there's you're nervous problems she said well thank the Lord he said welcome some clothes on now and she said brother Brandon we don't believe in that kind of old-fashioned stuff and I said well then what about last night the boy you was with in that place and she started crying and it exposed her sin and told her the adultery she was living in and how she fell on the floor and began to weep and now you see that adulterous Spirit was showing itself on the outside and was manifesting itself in her dress because what is on the inside is going to show on the outside so he says well lady you might be as virtuous and clean as you can be but if you dress in little Hollywood dresses and get on the street and man's looked at you you're guilty of adultery can you imagine you being you being a party to adultery because the way you dressed because of the way your daughter said the way that you vamped men and caused them to look at you in a sexual manner don't you realize you're guilty with him you see men we're in the mind that you can commit adultery you see young man why you shouldn't be looking at this pornography and stuff because that's where it's committed is in the mind first and then you take that kind of spirit on and there it will torment your your life it'll they it'll go right into your marriage it'll ruin your homes hey man I don't know what I'm talking about is the truth you can you cannot set any evil thing before your eyes amen now so Christian women to where mayor manicure on their face or wear makeup they're acting like the world more even more than forty billion dollars a years pin on cosmetic I'm on a challenging for girls that are using makeup get rid of the stuff quit buying this stuff and send that to missions and do something good with that money rather than bringing a reproach on the gospel of Christ do something that filled up the house of Christ [Applause] well anyway there's a lot a lot of this but your daughter's I've got to hear how they smoke they drink how does the men are smoking cigarettes and now since marijuana is legalized we're gonna have we're gonna have believers smoking marijuana you say how do you know that because they did it because they did it before it was legalized a man will you look at your watch for all of them chill it up real high all right it's almost 2:00 o'clock bulletins you don't know how sore my seat get you never had six surgeries on your feet and standing here preached for hours without complaining you never stood there like I have with blood running out of my toes to be able to preach the message you've never been with me in Africa where they sit on a little wooden plank with no back for hours and beg you to preach some more you're alright you're not going to die but I hope you'll die to sin I hope that some will be part of him by the Holy Spirit and can be adopted into the body of Christ your daughters I you know I dealt with a man by the name of Arne massive Mar Sione first time I met him it was end in Tucson Arizona he was standing behind the pulpit giving a witness of how he witnessed the message you know and he said now I got the Holy Ghost I just got a little problem with smoking cigarettes well he not just has a problem smoking cigarettes but when I met him over in Ohio as invited to go out to eat with him with him guys one day after I had preached a sermon there and brother Ernie Villanueva he was a Christian of true Christian brother and he was working with these boys and in trying to lead them into more and tell him that they needed more and he said come go with us come go with us we're witness into some Greek guy it's on the way you know they were telling me they're telling well yeah I'm witness tough old brother Ernie here he's in the full gospel businessman ubc guy and I witness to him about the message said I I couldn't you know I I couldn't think of it fast enough so I took a break and went out and smoked to build a joint of marijuana and come back brother I couldn't really tell the message here well it just made this little tube out for preacher here get mad I got angry enough to begin to say listen you need a new heart and a new spirit you've got that far maybe and you believe them message and all of that but you need something else you need God's Spirit amen you ever get his spirit in your life that I come that that sin will be as dead as midnight and it won't be you having the Holy Ghost but you got this little tobacco problem let me tell you you get the Holy Ghost it'll all be going hey man then I tell you what that day the Holy Spirit fell in that room and those men fell on the coffee table there and wet their way to Calvary and change their life from this would not man died he had a testimony I'm clean I'm saved I'm delivered I've been set free and my

into my home I can't I can't let it keep him going without crying out against it and I and I'm not talking about becoming a tyrant I'm not talking about some using them a beast force I'm about you on your knees bringing Christ into that home and bringing an atmosphere that begins to change lives I know I know what prayer will do in a home I know what godly leadership we're doing I know what applying the token will do look look at my my four children that I got I know what it means supply the token I know what it means to create an atmosphere I know what it means to how a home under the Holy Spirit and you can have it too and every one of your young men ought to make that your goal and ambition that Christ is gonna be the head of this home hey man you follow a little cliques in the church and your fussing and fighting and gabilan and biting and you know you don't like what goes over here and you don't like this and you find something wrong and here you know what you can go to wherever you want to go find whatever church you want to but unless there's a change on the inside you'll go there and it won't be long you be finding the problem here and the problem there and the brother you know what caused the problems right here [Music] and until you face it until you let the Holy Spirit deal with your life and bring that stuff out of your life and change you you're gonna

anchor in your salt that's what he wants to do bring you to adoption he wants to be able to entrust you and empower your life he wants to bring you to full turn now into our heads let me just say had you as the musicians are coming now also the tutor would talk about all separated dividing arguing and fussing disputing over little petty differences unbelief unthankful unholy without natural affection arrogant dilatory arguing our little religious differences and splitting airs and such nonsense and when we got today families that are all broke up supposed to believe the message and can't even worship together can't even come together to worship God together it's because the Holy Spirit is not there still there with bitterness hate some of you some of you don't want to even serve Christ today because of what you've seen in your own family's life but I'm gonna tell you your family is not the example the Bible is God's example when you sing your family do things in the Word of God says not to do don't blame the Bible don't blame the message when you see results of this ugliness hatred malice and variance fighting in the family mom and dad can't get along don't blame that on the message blame that on an unconverted life and I'm asking you today I'm asking you I'm asking for men to step up to become real men I'm talking I'm speaking about women to come to be real women

another more he said I don't care what they done to you and how bad they were you know you hear people say well I wouldn't care if they go to hell Oh God there's something awful there it ain't the Holy Spirit speaking it's maybe a wounded man wounded woman you can't help the love of God wouldn't see anybody lost I don't care what them I don't care what they said I don't care either he said one mortal can never condemn with nothing he said if you took that person by the hell and you and that person I want you to do this right there because there's certain peeling people right now that have been wounded maybe a parent legit now maybe a mother maybe a daddy maybe a brother maybe a certain maybe a stranger maybe I don't care maybe it's somebody you trusted and wounded you you just have had a lot of trouble maybe it was a wife or a husband it had this little spirit and root of bitterness he just grinds at you I want you right now just by faith just by revelation take it as it was that person by the hand so don't you to go before the throne of grace and kneel down before the father [Music] look over there and say father well this man condemned I want this man to go to hell you can't do it because first of all you're deserving with the same thing you may not have done what they did but you ought to go to hell to all of us we deserve to go but he took our place now what you just stand there just for a moment just realized I can't condemn this person I may not understand why they hurt me and why they done or how come they act in it I may be may be dealing with some real hurts but I'm just gonna let it go cuz I don't see that so lost and I want you from your heart just to forgive them let it go you know why because if you can't forgive your fellow brother fellow man to let a brother fellow man of their sins and trespasses neither will the Heavenly Father forgive you so let it go this let it go right now as we sing about it picture yourself before that throne of grace
