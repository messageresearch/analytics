TRANSCRIPT
========================================
A woman in the Bible days, her last meal almost gone. God sent Elijah to make his word known. He said, "Woman, don't you worry. For God sent me today." And before he even asking, help was on the way through. Just hold on a little longer. Help is on the way. The brighter day is coming for those who believe and pray. Helps tomorrow. Just hold on a little longer. Help is on the way. The troubles of this life come by and burdens get you down. You think no one is listening. You think no one's around. Just remember what his word says. Trust him and obey. Keep your eyes towards the heavens and all the way. Just hold on a little longer. Help is on the way. Brighter days coming for those who believe in pray. Help won't help tomorrow. If you give today, just hold on a little longer. Your on the way. Just hold on a little longer. Help is on the way. A brighter day is coming for those who believe and pray. You'll help tomorrow if you give a day. Just hold on a little longer. Help is on the way. Help tomorrow if you give up today. Just hold on a little longer. You'll be on the way.
