A woman in the Bible [singing] days, [music] her last meal almost gone. God sent [singing] Elijah [music] to make his word known. [music] He said, "Woman, don't [singing] you worry. For God [music] sent me today." And before he even [music and singing] asking, help was on the way [singing] through. [music] Just hold on a little [singing] longer. Help is on [music] the way. The brighter [singing] day is coming [music] for those who believe and pray. Helps [singing] tomorrow. [music] [singing] Just hold on a little longer. [singing] Help is [music] on the way. The troubles [music and singing] of this life come by and burdens [music] get [singing] you down. You think no one is listening. [music] You think no one's around. [singing] Just [music] remember what his word says. Trust [music] him [singing] and obey. Keep your eyes towards the heavens [singing] [music] and all the way. Just [music] hold on [singing] a little longer. [music] Help is [singing] on the way. Brighter days [singing] coming for [music] those who believe [singing] in pray. Help won't [music] help tomorrow. [singing] If you give [music] today, just [singing] hold on a little [music] longer. Your [singing] on the way. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Just hold on a little longer. [singing] [music] Help is on the way. [singing] A brighter day is coming [music] for those who [singing] believe and pray. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; You'll [singing] help tomorrow if you give [singing and music] a day. Just hold on a [singing and music] little longer. Help is [singing] on the way. [music] Help tomorrow [singing] if you give up today. [music] Just hold [singing] on a little longer. [music] You'll be [singing] on the way. [music] [applause]
