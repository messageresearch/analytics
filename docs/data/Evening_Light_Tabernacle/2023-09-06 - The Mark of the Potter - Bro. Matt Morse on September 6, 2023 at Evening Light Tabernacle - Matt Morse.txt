faithful you have been to us we thank you Lord before we even read one request that you hear our cry and you know our needs and Lord you're faithful and you're able not just able but you're more than able we love you with all of our hearts Lord we thank you for this opportunity to worship you and to give you glory and to give you honor to give you praise truly you have been so so good to us we thank you for these things Lord in your name how wonderful you are our father amen it's good to be back in the house so Lord with you and amen Tim and myself others went with us or gathered with us up there brother Ron Spencer's meeting for Labor Day had a wonderful time of the Lord and but it's always good to be home amen I always love coming home amen we have many needs this morning this evening we just want to take before the Lord and just ask God to move on the scene because I believe he's that kind of God and I I believe he knows what we have need of today um in our in our hearts and our lives before we even before we even ask he hasn't answered and we we know what kind of God he is he's not just enough he's more than enough amen he's he's not just a Healer and a liver but he's more than that he's everything we ever had need of amen we just love him tonight with all of our hearts and I was just reading this scripture and just read it again I sent it to some some of the days of the Lord will go forth like a warrior he will stir up his Zeal like a man of war he will shout out yes he will raise a war cry he will prevail mightily against all his enemies amen what a mighty God we serve there's nothing too hard for him there's nothing too great for him there's no sickness too great we know that already amen we can even like Tabernacle and say cancer is not too big out of peace is not too big brain bleeds are not too big he's that kind of God Amen and we know him to be that kind of God we have sister Erica Parker that's in a real intense battle right now that sickness of cancer in her life the devil's trying everything he can do to to Ravish her body with cancer but it doesn't matter what it looks like as far as what we see with these natural eyes it only matters what his word says and his word says by his stripes she's healed and I just believe that with all of my heart I maybe I'm dumb enough to believe it what if you don't call me I know God is able he ain't more than able and you know I was thinking about this thought of that little boy that little baby that brother Brandon went to and said it's the most hideous thing you ever saw could barely whistle out of his throat because of the cancer or whatever it was that was on him he said he didn't even know what to say but he said I I just placed the blood of Jesus between this boy and that sickness and he walks out in just a few moments and just a few look not too many hours of young man young baby was healed that's our God and I and I hope you come tonight expecting that kind of God to to move on our behalf and for our sister Erica and of course brother Ron Spencer as well and uh just ask the Lord to continue to touch his body we have brother Philip roncaller that went in today I believe it was today for a heart cath and they didn't really give him good news he has 100 percent blockage in what they call the Widowmaker so he has to have a surgery on Friday so uh just asking the Lord to be merciful in that situation brother Jonathan Middleton asked for prayer for sickness in his body tonight also brother Boyce Mitchell's in the hospital with an infection I think from a surgery that he had had some infection there so I just want to remember him today brother Dennis siminelli's brother John is on hospice really bad shape and asking prayer for that need how many would want to just take these knees before the Lord and maybe you have a need on your heart tonight you want to just mention it to the Lord in prayer let's just go to him in prayer father we just want to say Lord tonight how much we love you once again over thankful tonight that you are a faithful God that you're here and you hear our hearts request Lord I I think about the the where you told us to knock and keep on knocking and and ask and keep on asking and Lord we've called out these names many times but Lord we're here again tonight calling out the name of Erica Parker to you lord lord just reminding you Lord you have a daughter that has a need Lord I believe there's still purpose in her life here on this Earth and I just want to remind you Lord there's purpose as a mother and a wife and a daughter Lord she could serve and and a great testimony of your healing power Lord Lord I asked God that you would go to where she's at father the doctors are saying all the worst things they could possibly say and but Lord we don't look to what the doctor says we look to what your word says and your word says I'm the Lord God that heals all diseases your word says that by your stripes she's healed and Lord we confess that word and upon the confession of that word tonight we confess healing over our sister's body Lord that those spots of cancer will leave her and the lesions on her liver will go away and the swelling and all of that God you're more than enough Lord we don't really have the words to say but Lord we have an example and we as a Church of the Living God place the blood of Jesus between that daughter of God and that sickness and we say sickness take your hands off of God's Property Lord we ask these things tonight because we believe and we know you're that kind of God and we're just keep on asking and keep on knocking or for our brother Ron we continue to knock it for his need Lord and Lord we see Lord such a miracle in his life and God but we're looking for a completion of that healing and deliverance Lord and that body and Lord once again we place the blood of Jesus between him and that sickness and Lord we ask it in the name of Jesus to go and leave his body Lord for this infection and brother Boyce says well Lord brother Jonathan fight him Lord our brother Philip Lord having to face surgery God to me you just meet them I pray in them hospital rooms or wherever they're at tonight Lord just Comfort them Lord that you have everything in control and you're you're the provider you're able to take care of every need and every situation Lord You're the Healer the doctors can do the surgery but Lord it takes you to do the healing and we just ask God your director hands and give them the wisdom and the knowledge to do so we pray Lord for brother Dennis's brother Lord I ask God you'll be merciful on his behalf touch him Lord we pray tonight these hands were lifted all over this building God may you just Minister and touch hearts and lies we

God he ain't never tell me one time he led me out of sin he's led me from the from the shuts and he turned me from my path and he set my feet on a rock to stay I said he's an awesome God and he's worthy to be praised I think we have an awesome God I like to talk about it amen help me come to hear the word of the Lord amen how many come to have church tonight I love a church that's on fire for God a church of people that love the word of God how many love the word hey man isn't it wonderful to go to a church that people come and they come to hear the word there ain't no there ain't no other attraction but they come because they're weren't born children of God and they come to hear the word of the Lord there was an old preacher back in the 50s you may have heard of him his name was Jack Cole Jack Cole brother bam said he had Bulldog faith and I love Jack Cole I've listened to every sermon that he has recorded I'm one of them old souls I like to hear this old guys and they're the the inspiration that they had and but I remember a message that he preached it was called a message to the modern day Church I thought my if he preached that then imagine what it'd be like now he said but you know the churches today he said the only way they can get people to come to church is if they have a if they serve chicken and have an ice cream party and make sweet tea for everybody and he said that's about the only way they can get them there he said but I think if your church has to serve chicken and ice cream and tea to get people to come to church then your church is As Dead As the chicken it's as cold as the ice cream and it's as weak as the tea but I thank God that we have a church tonight that we can go to with a body of Believers that don't have to have some other attraction but the word of God has drawn us to the house of the Lord tonight that we could Fellowship around God's word didn't he Wonderful Tonight I said God's a life changer amen I love the Lord amen I just want to say it's good to be in the house to the Lord tonight and just want to thank brother Tim for inviting us to become and be a part and it's the first time I've got to see the the church that you built I've been there when in the old building before as a young man and my what a what a beautiful place God's really blessed you I it just touches my heart that God cares that much for his children what a blessing it is and I I've always had a lot of respect for brother Tim and and he even when I was a young man he used to come and preach our way and I fell in love with him as a as a little boy and I don't know if maybe because I was the shortest guy in there and by the time he was kind of he was kind of short too maybe I related but he just really he just was such a blessing to us and always always treated me with great respect and and I I've told my wife this before and I said you know there's only about four people in my life that called me Matthew and one of them is my mom and one of them is my banker and one of them is my wife and the other one was brother Tim Pruitt so my every time you'd see him you know I kind of I got a little older and I made my name Matt because it was a little easier and but every time brother Tim see he'd say well hey brother Matthew how are you and so he just really always touched my heart and we've it's just been a real blessing and we appreciate his leadership and the work that the Lord's done here and we've been pastoring in Arkansas there for almost five years now and had the privilege of sending a lot of our young people to your camp meetings and and I know a lot of them that y'all have met and I just want to say thank you as a church for putting on the meetings and the youth meetings I know it's a great sacrifice but I was telling brother Tim today I get to see the results of those young people when they come home and so I thank God that there's a people that will that will make the sacrifice and take the time and and put forth the effort to sow into the Youth of the message of the hour and and it's just been a great blessing and we're so happy to be able to be a part of him and I just want to maybe if we could just go before the Lord and a word of prayer tonight before we read the word and maybe if you have something on your heart I believe God is mindful of what we have need of and I heard brother Timothy say it before we came out that God has orchestrated this service as he does every service he knew who would be here and what would be spoke and what he would put on our heart to speak and I just I don't have anything I could say that would help anybody but I believe if the Lord would come by he could help amens I just trust him and maybe if you have a need on your heart won't we just see each one invite him to come in your own way and maybe just pray for those that's by you and gracious Heavenly Father Lord how privileged we are our Lord to stand in your presence again Lord we're so thankful for your spirit in this building and Lord as you told us in your word Lord and you've never failed us you told us where two or three are gathered together in my name there shall I be in the midst of them and Lord here we've came and Lord we've lifted your name in song and Lord in prayer and Lord we've lifted you in Praise Lord and I hope we've asked you Lord we've invited you Lord him God not only do we believe you're here by your word but Lord we recognize your presence tonight Lord I ask you Lord tonight a special request Lord God that you've brought this meeting together Lord and I pray Lord that you would speak to every heart Lord you know the needs of these people Lord I don't know them and Lord most of them don't know me but Lord we both know you and we have something in common Lord we're brothers and sisters in Christ and the Lord we ask you Lord that you would intercede on their behalf and God I pray Lord whatever they'd have need of Lord you would speak to every need Lord if it's a direction you want to take Lord I pray Lord that I would be able to surrender to you Lord that you could leave me tonight and God that your children will be blessed Lord we are so careful to give you the glory for all you do Lord we pray you anoint the word of God in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen may God bless you tonight and amen I just want to invite you to the scripture and we're going to read out of Jeremiah in the 18th chapter and we're going to start in the first verse and I want to bring greetings from our home Church in Grace Tabernacle and BlackRock Arkansas and and also my my wife has came with me this evening so just to appreciate that I have some of these young people I've had the privilege of meeting I had our tent meeting and things that we do at home and so just have a lot of dear friends here and I pray y'all will keep us in your prayers as well amen amen we just want to read from Jeremiah the 18th chapter we're going to start in the first verse the Bible says in the word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying arise and go to The Potter's House and there I will cause thee to hear my words then I went down to The Potter's House and behold he worked a work on the wheels and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the Potter so he made it again another vessel has seen good to the Potter to make it then the word of the Lord came to me saying O House of Israel cannot I do with you as this Potter saith the Lord behold as the clay is in The Potter's hand so were you in mine hand and what has asked the Lord to add his Blessing to the reading of the word as you take your seats and and just I want to speak tonight on the mark of the Potter and this is something the Lord had just put on my heart and and just again just to appreciate the privilege of being here every one of these brothers have have came and spoke at our church and been just such a tremendous blessing and and just just wonderful testimonies and I might just share this as I get started but at our tent meeting last year brother Timothy had came and and spoke for us had a real move of God and and there was a lady there that was in that in that meeting during the time of the meeting and and that was 27 years she had been on pain medicine and been in and out of doctors for some health issues and they had her on a pretty high medication and and she had done that for 27 years and it was in that meeting last year that she came through the prayer line and the Lord took it from her immediately and she went home that night and and didn't take the pain medicine went to the doctor he said well we got to put you on a program to get to get past that and and because you're going to have withdrawals and you're going to have these symptoms and to this day here we are a year later and I can testify to you she's not had one symptom she had one withdrawal it was just a total deliverance and I believe God's that kind of a God and I appreciate these brothers for serving the lord and but I want to speak this this evening on the mark of the Potter and I know I just think it's wonderful as we come to church tonight and I had traveled around doing a lot of meetings and went from place to places doing missionary work and had the fellowship with a lot of Believers and and you know it's just there's so much chaos in the world it's nice to be able to have a place you can just come and fellowship around the word of God and and just have a wonderful atmosphere and you don't have to worry about people or what they'll say or do it's just a free spirit and and I feel that here and I just it's a welcoming spirit and I just want to just say appreciate it and and but you know I've been in the in the mission field and and done a lot of work over in India and been several times on trips there and and you know you go around the world and you find there's a lot of beliefs and there's a lot of there's a lot of gods there's a lot of religions there's even in just India alone there's there's hundreds of thousands of different gods even millions that people they worship all sorts of things and and you know the great religions that are there Hinduism and Buddhism and Muslims and you know after after a while you find out that every person that you meet it don't matter what what their race is or what country they're from or or what their background is every one of us have a testimony and every one of us have something that we're going going through or came through or going to go through and and but but I noticed in especially in in India you'll see so many religions and you'll notice that each person when they come after a little while you start being able to identify what religion they're of and because they haven't they have marks that are identifying marks and so when they would come you know you would maybe when you first got you didn't understand but after a little while you'd realize that a Muslim you could go and this was a Muslim people these were Hindu people or these were Buddhists and into you know but when you when you visit with them a little while they'll always ask you you know what what are you and you say I'm a Christian and I found this to be the case that that used to you could say I'm a Christian but today uh saying I'm a Christian isn't enough because once you tell somebody you're a Christian then they want to know what kind of Christian that you are you know well you're a Christian or are you a Baptist Christian or you're a Pentecostal Christian are you you know are you or you know what kind of a label it just seems like it don't matter who you talk to today that everyone wants to put a label on you they won't either make you a Baptist or make you a calvinist or or even in the in the political world the Democrat wants you to be a Democrat and the Republican wants you to be a Republican and it just seems that everyone is pulling you to their point of view and and you know they're trying to they're trying to to put that label on you in other words they're trying to keep or to get you to carry their marker to be a Democrat is to carry the mark of a Democrat to be a republican is to carry the mark of Republican and it just seems like it's the nature and I don't think it's a bad nature it's just the nature of humanity it's to get people to agree with you people want people to agree with them and and so you you see as they go and they begin to to pull their way and spread their their belief or introduce you to what they what they have it just seems like that each one is trying to draw you to this and and whenever if they can get somebody to believe them and if they can get somebody to get on their side if they if they can get somebody it's like an argument that's going on and you got one people on one side and other people on another and and they're just pulling at people trying to get them to get on one side or the other so they can say they have somebody else on their side and it just seems they get excited about it well we got another one and we gotta we got another one on our side and you know I thought as Paul dealt with this same thing he was preaching to the Galatians and he said you know this is the same nature when they were going around and and they were teaching on the doctrine of circumcision and Paul they would come to Paul and they would ask him about this this Doctrine and Paul said see he said neither they themselves who are circumcised to even keep the law but they he said but they desire you to be circumcised so that they make glory in your flesh he said see because their Glory came from winning another to their cause it wasn't really your soul that they were interested in it wasn't your life that they were interested in but it was getting somebody else to to to believe in their cause but the more I read about it I thought you know we too have a cause and Paul Paul said see we we our cause is this he said see God forbid that we should glory in anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ he said by whom the world has been crucified and I unto the world he said it's by this cross that I've been dead to the world he said it's Christ before in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but but only a new creation and Paul said so from henceforth let no man trouble me he said for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus I thought my isn't it something if we're going to Bear the mark of something Paul said let me bear the mark of the body of the Lord Jesus that the nature of my old man has been cut away and there that remains in me is a new creation a new creature in Christ I say this tonight let my body bear the mark of the Lord Jesus I mean say tonight let my body bear the mark of the Cross of Calvary let my body if I'm going to Bear a mark let me bear the mark of a new creation in Christ see the Bible says we were we're all marked you can go in the Book of Revelations and I won't take a lot of time on it tonight but just to lay a foundation but in the Book of Revelations it tells us that in the end time that people are going to be marked the Bible says that there will be a people that will be marked that would be marked for the mark of the beast and and so in their their end would be destruction and their end would be judgment and their their end would be the the the the Avengers of God and but you notice that in the end time that wouldn't be the only people that would have a mark But brother William said see in the end time there was two classes he said one would have the mark of the beast and the other one would have a seal of God he said see in the Seal of God is the holy spirit that's what Ephesians 4 30. he said greed not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of your Redemption he said but those that reject the Holy Spirit they're already marked by the beast but here but friends I've not come to talk about those that are marked by the beast but I'm come to talk about those that accepted the mark of God he said see this Mark of God is the Seal of God and it don't mean that you just say something that well I I accept the Seal of God it don't mean you say it just to be a part of something and it don't mean that you say it just so you can fit in the church and it don't mean that you say it to make Mama happy or you'll say it to me Daddy happy to accept the Holy Ghost is to accept a new life to accept the Holy Ghost is to accept a new creation to set to accept the Holy Ghost is to accept the new heart to accept the Holy Ghost is that the body change is to accept that one day this overall body will be caught up in the air with the Lord it'll be changed from corruption unto incorruption from mortality into immortality to accept the mark of God is to accept healing to accept the mark of God is to accept truth he says see well brother man I can't you know I can accept the mark of God but there's certain things there are certain things I can't accept but friends let me tell you a secret tonight you can never accept the Holy Ghost and reject the truth of God's word but the Bible says the Holy Ghost will lead you and guide you into all truth so if you accept the mark of God you accept the supernatural if you accept the mark of God you accept the move of the spirit of God if you accept the mark of God you accept the pastor if you accept the mark of God you accept evangelists and preachers and teachers and Prophets everything that comes with the word of God to accept the mark of God is to accept the word of God then when you accept it it'll keep you from evil for the Bible said that there were those that came they were under this great evil in the revelations of ninth chapter they came into a great evil you remember he said they come out of a bottomless pit those that that didn't have the Seal of God on their foreheads so this Tormentor came out of a bottomless pit and they went to torment in the world I got to reading this yesterday and thought hell what a tragedy it is to think of a people that would be tormented in such a way that the Bible says they would beg for death and God wouldn't even let them die they were tormented for all the time that would pass by of this torment but the Bible says is this Tormentor went out this great evil that came out of the bottomless pit that went out to torment he said see it could touch not those that had the Seal of God on their foreheads I thought my every man and every woman it didn't matter it didn't matter where they came from or who their mama was or who their dad he was or or what church they went to or what what denomination they were from or how great they were or how much money they had he went out to torment all of them that didn't have the Seal of God upon their forehead but let me tell you something friends that this seal of God not only is it on their foreheads but when it's placed there it affects your whole body to the Seal of God it affects the way you act it affects the way you live it affects the way you look see the Seal of God although it's placed on their forehead but it but it affects your feet it changes where you go it affects your hands and it changes what you touch it affects your eyes and it changes what you see it affects your mouth and it changes what you say see it's the Seal of God and brother man said this seal he said it ain't some stamp or some spot that God would come and put on you he said but see hear what God is doing he said your forehead is your Revelation and your hand is the thing you do about it he said so see here what God is doing is giving you a spiritual Mark that we might do the work of the Lord I thought isn't it something that this is what Peter asked the Lord when he knelt down and Jesus was going to wash his feet and Peter said Lord I'll not have you wash my feet and Jesus said if I don't wash your feet you'll have no part with me and Peter asked him he said well Lord if that's the case then what's not my feet only but also wash my hands in my head I'm thought isn't it something here the prophet of God would say he says see the Seal of God is on your forehead he said and it's the Revelation from God and then he said but then the hands is the work that you do I thought oh my God let me be that way tonight Lord not my feet only but wash my hands in my head I say Lord cleanse me that I may do the work of the Lord cleanse me from my head down to my feet that night but one thing in my body that would hinder the move of God and let me bear in my body the mark of the Lord Jesus Christ you say brother man what will it do to you let me tell you what the prophet said he said it'll do what they did in the first church they were filled with the Holy Ghost and their Works were the works of Christ they laid hands on the sick and they recovered they've done all kinds of signs and miracles and wonders he said because their forehead was healed by the Revelation that he was the son of God and they were working with him the deity of Christ he said there's the mark not only were they marked for the Revelation he said but then they had hands to do a work the Revelation caused you to do a work you say brother my well you mean the Lord's calling us to work that's what Jesus said he said the Harvest is plenty but the laborers refute my think about us doing the Lord's work what is the Lord's work we go out and have services and we we preach the gospel and we go in the mission fields and spend money and time and efforts and winning souls and testifying to the work of the Lord and building places for people to come and worship and little huts and places and laying hands on the sick it's all God's work I think sometimes people forget it takes work to do the Lord's work see sometimes it takes work to do the Lord's work see it's a different it's a different kind of work working for the Lord than it is working at a job or working in the Natural Way working for the Lord don't have the toll of the of the labor that we have in this natural it's a different kind of work see see our natural work came after the fall in the garden remember what God came and he told the the woman he said in sorrow Thou shalt bring four children and that desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee and then he told to Adam he said curse will be the ground for thy sake for in sorrow thou shall eat of it all the days of my life and the thistles it'll bring forth in the sweat of thy face Thou shalt eat bread see it looks like the work began after the fall but see but before the fall there was still work to do but it was just not the sorrow of work see before the fall it was not the sweat or the toll or the that heavy yoke of survival that we go through working in our natural life but before the fall it was a different kind of work for the Bible says when God made man and he made him in the Garden of Eden here that man was in a perfect condition with God here he was in fellowship with God and I thought isn't it something that there there wasn't nothing negative that could come in not even a negative thought if he that he could even allow here Adam when he was sitting in fellowshipping with God in this perfect place and here God would desire that the people of God today would be in that kind of condition I thought isn't that the way it is when we come to the house of God see Eden is a sanctuary to have fellowship with God that's why we come to the house of God and we sing songs and we worship God you say what are we trying to do is to create an atmosphere a sanctuary you could say it's a temporary Eden it's a place where that God can come and have fellowship and he can he is a sanctuary he can have communion with his children where he can speak lift to ear and when you have needs you can tell him what you have need of and he can answer your prayer to make an atmosphere where God can move that's why we come we come to church to have communion with God to get into a place that God can speak to us but even in this place listen what God told Adam the Bible said and the Lord took the man and he put him in the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it so see even in that atmosphere there was still work and it wasn't just the man for the Bible said he needed to help mate so he made him a wife to be a helper mate for him so him and his wife both had work to do you see see it still work but without the toll of the flesh it's work without the cause or the curse of death see the Lord's work comes with an eternal reward I wonder tonight how many would say I come to do the Lord's work why don't we go to church we come to do the Lord's work we come see this is God's work this ain't this ain't this ain't something that you come to get a paychecker we come to do the Lord's work brother said that's what we're here for that's why we're happy to hear that the work of the Lord is increasing every time we come into the house of God Brother David that's why we come to church it's that we can make a place for God to move that's why when we come to the house of God is to do is to do the work of the Lord friends we're not just working on the church service it ain't just working on having a good time it ain't just working on that way we can feel good whenever we go home but when we come to into the the house of God we come to to have a a place of worship when we come to restore the temple of God and we don't come just to do the physical part we don't come just to run this town and make a good live stream or to make some good songs or good singing you know sometimes even that kind of work it gets common in the work but there's a greater work that we do every time we come in the house of God Jesus said know ye not that you are the temple of God see when you come to the house of God you come to do the work on God's house when you come to the house of God you come to work on the temple of God I thought you know that's the way it is sometimes the temple gets in bad shape and it just needs a little bit of work amen somebody sometimes the temple needs work sometimes it used to be a place of worship and it used to be a place of sacrifice and it used to be a place that was dedicated to God a place that God could well but sometimes just like our natural house it'll get cluttered up and it needs a little bit of spring cleaning and things start to get in there that that that you you wouldn't really want to invite anybody in to see what's going on the inside and that's what happens with the temple sometimes the Bible says you're the temple of God but sometimes the temple gets filled up with things sometimes it just needs a little work it's a spiritual house sometimes it gets in bad shape sometimes we need the Lord to come by we need to work on the temple you ever thought of the history of Solomon's Temple when God made it it was a place where the glory of God could be seen and when they built the temple it wasn't long I thought how did they built it and it was so wonderful and the presence of God moved and flowed so freely through it and the people they were so free to worship and but after a little while and as the the sin would enter in and before long they got into this captivity of Babylon and the Bible would tell us as Babylon had taken over and took the people of Israel and put them in this state of Exile you know what I saw when I thought of these people being in this state of Exile here was a people that had a desire you know think of all these folks it wasn't every one of them wasn't doing something wrong I thought here's some people there was some good people in that in that Land There were some good people and there there was there were some prophets there there was some even even we read the prophets of Exile and I thought here they were they were all in this condition and it was a people that had a desire to worship God but it had no place to do it I thought I wonder if you ever felt that way there there's something on the inside of us that has a real desire to worship God in there there's something on the inside of us that has a real desire to be a believer and to be so and to be so sold out to God that God could freely work through us but there's something that that won't let us do it to see this is the condition of the temple a desire to worship but no place to do it but then they they came and the prophet Joel came and spoke he said but I will restore saith the Lord I thought am I into something even in that condition but they had a word from the Lord I will restore you say brother Matt well what did it take to restore it took a people that was willing to take the prophet's word he said I'll restore it took somebody that was willing to take the words of a prophet and go get their hands dirty it took a people that was willing to follow us Aruba back into Jerusalem and didn't care to pick up a shovel or pick up a wheelbarrow or pick up a saw cutter or a diamond bait or something that didn't care to go work on rebuilding the temple of God friends all it took was somebody they had a desire to return the temple to its former glory and the Bible says in the word of the Lord came to the prophet hagai he said speak now to zerubbabel the governor of Judah into Joshua the high priest and to the residue of the people and say who among you is left that saw this house in her first glory and how do you see it now is it not as nothing what a question that he asked he said asked him who among you saw the house like it used to be and is it not as nothing now I thought my listen what God was asking them are you satisfied with the temple of God now what a question if God would ask it this evening are you satisfied with your temple are you satisfied with the condition of God's Temple are you satisfied with the temple of God has it lost some Foundation has it lost some Stones has it been filled with things has it been taken up by things of the world oh friends if there if there was ever a time then the time is now if there if there ever was a time you could think of a people that need to be satisfied with God's Temple he's called us to praise he's called us to a time of worship he said brother man there was a time when the temple it was pleasing to God there was a time when this Temple it was filled with the glory of God there was time you know that this Temple it was so free to come and worship God and you know I could go to church and I could lift my hands and in my ear it didn't take it it didn't take some song to get me worked up it I'd be the first one in there and I'd go to church 30 minutes early I took my Bible and I'd read my Bible in prayer and create an atmosphere for God to move and when I'd go home I'd kneel down on my bedside at night and you know I'd kneel down and pray and I had a real relationship with God put my job and things in my life and the pressures of life and all those things begin to build up and you know I used to sing I used to have so much joy but now I got so many bills and oh you know I went through a disagreement with somebody or whatever it is are you satisfied with the condition of the Temple what a question are you satisfied with the condition of the table let me tell you something that not only were the people not satisfied with it but God wasn't either but he didn't leave him in that condition he said now hey guy say to unto them be strong osiruble saith the Lord and be strong o Joshua the high priest and be strong all the people of the land and work for I Am With You isn't it something that he told he says irritable Joshua and the people Caesar Ruble was the type of the Lord Joshua being the top of the Holy Ghost he said Joshua the priest I thought am I here see the Lord has a work to do the preacher the Holy Ghost Field preacher he had a work to do he said but see the preacher has to do his part and the people have to do their part but then the Lord does his part so what what did he say he'd do he said in a little while I'll shake the heavens and the earth and the Sea and all the dry land and I will shake all the nations and I will fill this house with Glory saith the Lord of hosts in the glory of this latter house will be greater than the glory of the formal but friends let me tell you tonight that God wasn't just talking about Israel but he was talking about you tonight he wasn't just speaking of Israel but he was speaking of Christ in the Church of the Living God that when Christ would come into the heart of a Believer he would be a greater glory be strong and work you say brother man that's the way it is in the church today every time you come in God's house it takes work let me tell your friends I don't think I've ever went to church it takes work to get your mind off the world it takes work when you sit down on a Pew to get your mind off a problem it takes work to get your mind off your job and work to get your mind off of school and work to get your mind off your life and work to get your mind off of trouble but we keep working see that's the devil's trick is to get your mind so caught up in problems that you can't see the promise of God you can't see the will of God that you'll miss out on a blessing of God but I say who came to work tonight yet to work see brother I want to work to get my mind on the things of God let me work to create an atmosphere for God to move let me work to make Christ welcome and the devil says you're just trying to get people worked up I say no I'm not that was the prophet of God he said be strong and work it ain't me but be strong all the people of the land and work worked at the house would be filled with Glory sometimes it takes work it takes it takes laying before the Lord it takes it takes crying out to God and surrendering and it just seems like people today they only can the only uh forgiveness now that wonders they come and stand for a few minutes and walk away and think it's going to change everything in their life but it takes time to pour it out and emptying out and emptying out before the Lord that the house could be filled I imagine some of them got tired of working some got tired of pushing wheelbarrows some of them got tired of packing Stone and things to the temple but they worked what an encouragement be strong and work for the glory of the latter will be greater than the glory of the former isn't it something that God wouldn't leave the temple in that condition I thought what a type that is today that he won't leave your temple in that condition either he said because I have made a covenant with you when I brought you out of Egypt I made a covenant and I'm and I intend to keep the Covenant that I made I thought it did something it's not just the preachers that are working it ain't just the people that are working but God's working too it ain't all on us but God's doing his part every service God's working to every time you come in the house of God God's working too the Bible says the word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart it's God working on his children he goes out into the congregation and he's searching hearts and lies and he's finding weaknesses and voids in her life and cutting things out of her life to bring us to a certain place see it's not God's desire for you to be wrong God don't trap you and trick you that's what the devil does he don't he don't lay a trap up ahead to try to see if he can catch you in a trap just to bring you down a little bit God don't lay a trick up the road that try to trick you to bring you down the devil is traps and then goes and tells on you for falling in them but God's intention is to lead you out to see God still works too I thought of how that he comes in the service what is he doing but he comes to bring the preaching of the word to to bring correction and you know I thought isn't it something that that you know most people when you receive correction you take a little boy and by it don't feel very good he said but what we ought to do is we ought to thank God because it's the grace of God that he wouldn't leave you in error the Bible says Jesus said as many as I love I rebuke and Chase and be zealous therefore and repent can I break this down a little bit let everyone said notice he said first off notice who he was talking to he said and now he says to his own so if God is correcting us it's because we belong to him but first off he says to his own as many as I love I rebuke and Jason said seek to rebuke is to refuse Mo or to reprove most people read this I rebuke and chasing and they've got God running around with this great whip just beating up on people because they don't do things right but around said notice he said see to rebuke is to reprove and to reprove is to expose with a view to correction so in other words if God is correcting us he's correcting us for a purpose he says see so so chasten it doesn't mean to punish see most of the time you you'll take the the moments today I may as well just preach about you take the moments today and they don't want nobody whipping their kids you got these this certain weird thing going on around the world that you can't spank kids no more and you know it's just a you know I I knew that I do a different way of parenting and all and they came up this new way of parenting but but the reality is is because they don't understand the difference between punishment and discipline but around says see God chasten does not mean punish punish means to inflict a penalty so if you're beating your kids out of punishment well they didn't write anyway he said see but it means to inflict the penalty but to Chase and it means to discipline don't mean they didn't get a weapon but it was for the purpose of it he said see the purpose is to train a certain Behavior because the subject's amendment is in mind that's what discipline is it's to train a child remember the Bible says train up a child in the way it ought to go that's why we discipline our children and God disciplines us he says see it's a trainer Behavior because the subject's amendment is in mind in other words that God has a desire to make minor changes or modifications in our life he's trying to bring us into this perfect place or to this image that he has in his mind and so and so he he ain't punishing us but he discipline us says he chastens us and when we hear the word of God see it's changing us and it's growing us this is what Paul said about it he said my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when you're rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and he Scourge with every son whom he receiveth and if you endure chastening God deals with you as Sons for what son has the father that he doesn't chase him but if you be without chastisement you're where are where we're all partakers then you're a bastards and not Sons I thought friends I want God to deal with me as a son I don't want God to deal with me as a servant I want to be dealt with as a son you see a Son of God he has different privileges that a servant don't have see sons that come with a they come with a certain thing a son a Son of God has a security see you have a servant that worked for you and you didn't want him working for you or he done something wrong you could just fire the servant but a Son of God you can't fire so you don't fire your son well you've done something wrong and and you shouldn't have done that and daddy don't come down and say well you're fired you're no longer my son or you're no longer my daughter see a Son of God it has a security but also it has an assurance the Bible says the spirit of God Bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God so because we're children he reminds us that we're his children he gave us the security that we will always be his children and the Bible said and if you're his children then you're Heirs of God and your torn heirs with Christ that means everything that God gave to Christ he gave to you so if he made him gave him power over the devil then he gave you power over the devil if you gave him power over sickness then he gave you power over sickness he raised him the Bible says he raised him from the dead and he set him on the right hand of God in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and then Paul said and then God has made us to sit in Heavenly places see friends he's made us co-equal he's made us a joint Heir with God that every right that he had was been given to the Church of the Living God appearance I don't know about you tonight but I thank God for my god-given rights I thank God for the privilege of being a son and a daughter of God we ain't just some that just get by every now and then but God has bestowed upon you the rights of a son and the daughter of God we've been made to sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus well the man said every enemy is under your feet how many say Amen every enemy is under your feet as long as you're in Christ because everything's under his feet can we get a little bit more on this he said see he said every sickness every devil every Power even death itself is under your feet this is the truth he said if I can just get the church to see that brother we'll be a triumphant church friends we know what it'll do it'll cause the church not to come to church just guessing to see if God's going to do something but a man said well what he'll do he'll take all the guessing out of it it'll take the Hope out of it it'll take the imaginary out of it it'll take I thank God the make-believe the story time the little good old stories that people talk about God and it'll put the real faith of God in the heart of a Believer he said and then they'll come and say I have the faith of God and I know it's going to be and then something is going to happen you see what Satan's doing he's trying to take that out of your life you say well how will he do it he'll take the power out of The Believer by unbelief how would he take the power you see but let me tell your friends that Satan ain't the one that gave it to you so Satan can't take it away hello somebody somebody say the word gave it to me see Satan didn't give it to you what gave you the power what gave you the power of the devil the word gave it to you what gave you power over sickness the word gave it to you what gave you power over grief the word gave it to you what gave you power over sin the word gave it to you what gave you power over the flesh the word gave it to you he said in all things are under your feet but how many knows did Apostle Paul he said but there's one exception to that he said all things under my feet this exception that Paul preaches about he said this there's an exception to that and that exception is why so many people are powerless today I I counsel with people all the time that just seem like they live such a powerless life and I say you know friend the first thing I'm going to ask you I'm going to talk about Paul's exception see Paul says you can read this you say well brother man what what exception is it is it cancer that's not under my feet no that wasn't it is it maybe it was depression that's not under my feet no that ain't it maybe it's suicide the only the thing I can't overcome maybe that's that's what it is no that ain't it at all Paul tells us First Corinthians 15 27. he said he has put all things under his feet but when he saith all things are put under him now this word put under come from a Greek word hupatasso which means to rank under or to make subject to and Paul said when he saith then it is Manifest that he is accepted in other words it's an exception which did put all things under him this is good stuff in other words read this in context what he's saying he says that when God said he put all things under the feet of Christ he said there was an exception and that exception was the one that put all things under his feet he said see so in other words he's not included in the group specifying he says so the one that gave the power for you to be subject to the devil or the one that put all things under your feet Paul said the next verse he said see how everything everything is subject to him he said but the son itself is subject to the father he says so so the only exception there is he said God is our exception he says Caesar the only way listen what Paul's saying he said the only way that the son ever had power is because the son was subject to the father how come everything was under his feet it's because he was under the father he said see he was subject to the one that gave the power I thought my isn't that the way it is it's the power of the church came by the word of God you wonder why people are so powerless it's because they're not under subjection to the word of God see the only way Satan is subject to you is if you're subject to God the only way he's subject to you is if you're subject to the word you want healing in your body then you must be subject to the word of God if you want Deliverance then be subject to the word of God if you want God to move on your behalf then be subject to the word of God if you want the Lord to answer your prayer come under subjection to God's word no wonder Satan wants to keep the word out of the church because the subjection to the word brings authority over the devil oh my you ever noticed a picture I always thought it was wonderful the picture the brother by him and had the angel of the Lord taking the picture over in in Houston Texas I thought it did something about that photo that the angel of the Lord didn't appear under his feet but it appeared over his head he said see because he was subject to the angel we're subject to God we're subject to the word of God we ain't trying to be big somebody's we're not trying to be over everybody else but we want to be subject to the word of God that God can use us he can heal us he can deliver us he can lead us to do the work of God see there's a purpose of God's correction see the Paul said he said our Earthly fathers they correct us to satisfy their own gain he said and we reverence them but he said but rather much rather wouldn't be be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live severely I say a few days chastened us after their own pleasure our Earthly fathers he said but whenever God chastens us he does it for our prophet he said see that we might be partakers of his Holiness but isn't it wonderful that when God chastens us he chastens us for our good see he chastens us that we'll be partakers he he chastens us he corrects us that we might receive a blessing from God let me tell you something about God friends God he can't change his word for anybody so it means God can't change his word for you so if God wants to bless you and there there's things in his word that God wants to bring for your life and the only way he can get it there is to get you in line with the word that provides it he says cease to obedience to the word brings out the blessing of God he corrects Us in order to bless us God don't correct us to beat on us he don't correct you just to stomp on you and to beat you down where you can't have any Liberty and you can't be a Son of God and then you can't even can't even worship God no more but God don't correct that way it corrects you to lift you up he corrects you to bless you he corrects you that you can be free he corrects you that you can have Liberty in the house of God that's the kind of correction that God brings and Paul said to me the chastening it seems not joyous it seems Grievous he said when it's going on but afterward it'll bring forth the fruit of his righteousness afterward it'll bring the blessing of God on our life he said and then we'll lift up our hands that have been hanging down after correction he said you'll lift up our hands that have been hanging down he said you'll you'll take he'll lift up your old feeble knees and make the path straight for your feet I thought isn't it something that the correction of the word of God brings a Revival to the church isn't it something that God's word when it comes in the power of Correction it don't beat the church down it beats it lifts them up it'll cause a joy to come into your heart it'll cause a Revival to come into your life Paul said it'll lift up your old hands that have been hanging down and change your feeble knees it's sad how people go go in church today just sometimes or the way people walk around it's sad how they are when I when I read that scripture it made me think of Darwin in that picture that they have whenever they talk about Evolution and at the very beginning they have that whole ape and have knees out like this and hands all hanging down and that that's where they depicted that humans were made and then they went from that and turned into people but but anyway we were made it all I thought isn't that something but Paul says but it'll straighten up your feeble knees and it'll cause the hands that have been hanging down to be raised up let me tell you friends we didn't come to church like a bunch of eights we came to church like Sons and Daughters of God and the correction of the word puts joy in your heart the correction of the word it takes condemnation out of your life and the correction of the word it causes you to lift your hands and praise God when you can't be free in the house of God a little correction of the word of God it'll put a dance back in your step it'll take that old Spirit of down the depression off of you cause you to be able to worship God again we weren't made like a bunch of AIDS the Bible says we are made in the image of God we weren't meant to be filled with condemnation you weren't meant to walk around with your head down and your knees down and your arms all beat up and defeated that ain't the way God Made You he made you to walk upright the position of a Believer is not down the position of a believer's up our position is an overcomer that's why God told job he said Joe where were you when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy see those morning Stars they were the angels of light but you know that ain't the only place they sing but a brown said see they had a celebration before there ever was a speck of Stardust before God ever created they were having a celebration in heaven but then one day whenever Christ was born on the Earth then the angels of God came down to some Shepherds in a field he said then they had a celebration on Earth you say brother man what caused them to sing in heaven it's because God was in heaven what caused them to sing on the earth it was because God was on the Earth he said see and what they did on the Earth was a reflection of what they did over on the other side I thought Nah if it's that way for the angels of God then what about the sons of God that were shouting for Joy I say they've shouted on the other side what caused them to shouting Glory it's because God was in glory what caused him to shout on the earth is because God's in the Earth and what you do here is a reflection of what you are there friends we weren't made to be dead God's people ain't a bunch of dead people we he said we're made to be alive we're made to praise God we're Made To Worship the Lord we can't help it even even if this flesh dies isn't it something even the Flesh of a man dies in a few days it'll come back it'll come in in another body I thought my even a flesh dying it can't keep you down it'll be right where it was back into the perfect image of God again appears the same God I think of the same God that made the man in the beginning he's the same God this Foreman man now it's never changes the same work you say how do you know that that's what God is doing with people now because it's the same form or nothing's ever changed it's always been the same Potter the Bible says the Lord God formed Man Out of the Dust to the ground and he breathed or breathe into his nostrils the Breath of Life in the book of Jeremiah he said to Jeremiah before I formed you in your mother's womb I knew you isn't it something that was the same Potter it was the same God it was the same one that formed him but remember says see they're the Potter before the Potter lies all mankind as one lump of clay and out of that same lump he'll now make vessels of honor and dishonor and the choosing is his own choosing but then the chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained to conform to His Image in their walk he reproves us with all long-suffering and gentleness and mercy but his own hands think of it with his own hands Brother David he corrects us for the hand of the Potter he corrects us but the hand of the Potter I thought my isn't it something that this is the place when Judah had sinned and they had allowed evil to come in their hearts it's so bad that whenever God would send judgment upon Judah that that Jeremiah would go and repent to God and say Lord this judgment is so bad don't let it come upon me he saw it and he said Lord whatever you do don't let I'm not part of it he saw the Judgment of God and the Lord began to speak to him he said Jeremiah go down to The Potter's House and I'll give you the answer so here the prophet of God I thought here as he goes down the Bible says he went down to The Potter's House and he went down he said I've seen him doing a work on the wheels and the vessel that he made was marred in his hand so he made it again isn't it something to think they'd hear this Potter could take something that was broken something that was they had they had cracks in it and had maybe some dryness of over the past few months or things that had been going on and let a little dryness get in and some cracks in the vessel that it wasn't able to be used in the way it was intended he said but he could make it again I thought as he watched the hens of the Potter I could just see Jeremiah sitting there the Lord sends his Prophet to go to a Potter's House here he's looking for the answer of the Lord and he goes down to a place I could just see they have a little Hut out there and the Potter working out there on the wheel and here Jeremiah the prophet goes out and he just stands as a as a visitor just watching as The Potter's work in this work of clay no I thought of it and you know one time I was over I was over in India on my first trip missionary trip that I went on when I was out there they we we had a big youth meeting there and these are kids that don't have they don't even have the the their parents or Hindus or different ones and and if they would even accept Christianity that their mamas and daddies wouldn't even let them move back in their house I watched 13 and 14 year old boys and girls that would give their heart to the Lord and go live in an orphanage because their parents wouldn't allow them home but they'd come to a meeting and get under the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost and you know all these things that they've been taught these are kids that had grown up and never even heard the name Jesus but somebody would bring them to a meeting and they'd get so inspired by the word and I thought my if God would take him and he could take their life and change it in that way and I remember after that first meeting that we had there there were so many I I don't remember the number but then maybe 25 or 30 or or so of them in that first service that came in and gave their heart to the Lord and wanted to be baptized so he went out in on the riverbank there and then Brothers was going out and there was several hundred kids at the at the meeting that invited their friends and in the in the pastors we were setting up on the river bank and I remember watching those young people go down into that River and as they walked down in there of course here me being from the United States I I kind of eased over to the side and if you get caught baptizing somebody then then it's you know it's a it's a life sentence for about every one of them that you would baptize and so it's quite a in that in that region so so I went over to the side and I was watching them baptize them and and I remember when I looked down on the in the Rocks there was a there was a little clay picture about this big around when I saw it I thought you know that'd be a neat souvenir you know I come from from Arkansas and they there's a lot of pottery and Indian artifacts and stuff like that and so I thought you know that'd be a neat souvenir and I picked it up and and the brothers all the pastors that were there and they kind of gathered around where we were we were praying and one of the brothers he said oh brother Matt throw that down throw that down I said what's the matter he said you don't want you don't want that I said well why not he said well that was used to worship Hindu gods and I thought here I was holding this piece of pottery and just a piece of clay that had been used it was made it was created for the purpose by the by the man that had put it together for the purpose of worshiping a Hindu god and the more I thought looked at it the more I thought about it I asked that brother I said brother have you ever heard the story of the Potter and the clay he said well I don't guess I have and I I got I sat down on some rocks and them brothers began to gather around I took that little pot piece of pottery in my hand he said oh brother I wouldn't even hold that he said don't you realize he said that that's something we would break it he said that was used for the wrong reason and I looked out at those young people walking down in that River little girls and little boys that were walking down the water and something came over me and I said brother so were every one of them when they were made by their parents and and they were raised up they were put in them to serve a Hindu god they spent every day of their life worship it's some other God every day of their life they spent out there in Hinduism I said that one day the Potter came by where they were and he called him out of their house into a meeting over here and he began to pour a spear and he took them down to the potter's wheel and he moved holding him and he reshaped them and he made them into a vessel that could worship almighty God I said friends that may been used to worship something else but today it's been changed I said this Potter has got a hold of it it ain't what it used to be he's changed it by the hands of the Potter God said as the clay is in The Potter's hand so are you in my hand I don't care what you came out of I don't care what you've been going through I don't care what life's been alive I don't care how many battles you've been facing as the apocaly is in The Potter's hand so are you in my hand [Applause] he's the same Potter he's the Potter that formed in the very first man in the beginning let me tell you friends there's many Potters that has formed many vessels they made Vessels to carry water they made Vessels they carry to carry grass seed and Herb see in food but let me tell you this Potter the first vessel that he ever made he wasn't made to carry some man-made thing it was made to carry the very breath of almighty God for the Bible says he made it and he breathed into his nostrils the Breath of Life that's our Potter oh my authority he made us if he made us in the beginning well what makes you think he can't mold you what makes you think you can't shape you what makes you think you can get so out of shape that God don't know what to do with you let me tell you this I can tell you you can get so out of shape that the devil don't know what to do with you that God don't know what to do with us he's the Potter the one that made us who I thought is he this Potter he went down that day here in the very beginning he took a dirt off the ground the first vessel he ever made and he began to form it I'm gonna hurry and close but to begin to form it y'all too easy to preach to but I could just see as he went down he made made the shoulders of a man here he was made in His image of the Bible said but then he took the dust to the ground and he formed man or isn't it something to think that he formed he took him and made his hair in his head and began to make this shape that God wanted the man to look like he formed him you catching it he formed him now here's the The Potter's hands he formed him with his own hands he placed his hands on every every part of him he made there wasn't a piece of him that God didn't make he formed the Men Out of the Dust to the ground when it was when it had no form when it had no shape I thought it it did something and he had never had any practice it was the first vessel that God had ever made and he made it in perfection he formed it and I thought as he looked down at it I wonder if God when he looked at it that he wanted it to live the Bible said when it got done forming I could just see Adam laying there on the ground formed by God maybe God walked around and looked at him for a bit that's exactly what I wanted him to look like but then he said he knelt down and he breathed into his nostrils the Breath of Life Friends when the Breath of God entered into that clay vessel something started to happen I say something started to happen the heart in that clay vessel started beating that heart that was made from clay it started beating the lungs that was in that vessel that was made by God they began to fill up with air I thought as God would Breathe the breath of life into that old clay vessel all of a sudden maybe over his hand just laying there still and after God began to breathe in him all of a sudden a little finger starts to move like this after a little bit a little toe starts to move like that you say what is it brother man it was Signs of Life why because the Breath of God had entered into an Earthen vessel [Applause] he made him he formed in him and he breathed into him his own breath and Man became a living soul and all of a sudden I can just see Adam as he stood up and he rose from the dust to the ground hear that that man that God had formed imagine what it was like I I wish I could see it what it was like that day that he stood up by God and God took him by the hand and he shook his hand for the first time and he hugged his neck for the first time he was made by God in the same God that formed him formed you he made every part of you there ain't not one part of you that was a mistake he made sure that's why I told Jeremiah I formed you in your mother's womb he knew how you would be he knew the problems that you'd faced he knew the things you'd have to overcome he's God and he made you he's our partner he's been molding us ever since you know they say a Potter an old Potter when he makes a vessel there's something distinct about every Potter that whenever he gets to the end of making the vessel that he's making that he actually leaves a mark on it so they say it like this that the Potter that because when it gets down to the end and he's shaping and the wheels turning and the clay is turning in the wheel then when it gets to the end maybe he would have his hand aimed a certain way while it while he was shaping it is the peace begins to take shape he would he would move his hand a certain way and would leave a mark they call this in the Antique World The Potter's mark and so there are those that were whenever the antique dealers when they go look at a piece of pottery that's how they identify if it's authentic because because it has the mark of the Potter on it see it shows by what hand that it was made you know sometimes I thought of this as our Potter as he's made us the hand of our Potter just as he made Adam and just as he created him and you know sometimes the hand of God is Stern sometimes the hand of God as he as he's making us and molding us and shaping us and and sometimes sometimes it hurts but brother Brown says but notice he chastens us with nails card hands I thought my his hands of Correction are hands of Grace his hands of Correction our hands of Mercy see our Potter's hands has a distinctive Mark it's the imprint of a Roman nail well friends let me tell you tonight that's why every one of us can stand as Believers it's because we bear the mark of the Potter you say brother man what is this that's shaping the church today it's the hand of the Potter it's the nails card hand

used to be my life is a testimony of the mark of the Potter it took me took my life into his hands isn't it something throwing a piece of clay that God has ever taken into his hands that he didn't leave a mark on he leaves a mark I think God denied that we can bear The Potter's mark you know there was a lady by the name of Fanny Crosby you remember the blind lady wrote songs and so she wrote
