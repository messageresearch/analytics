[23:23] amen amen let's turn to James chapter 4
[23:28] and verse 7 aim and it's always good to
[23:33] be in the house of the Lord and serve
[23:36] his people and no matter where you're at
[23:38] whether you're here you're in your
[23:40] home's tonight god bless you tonight a
[23:43] man and a man may the Lord just come and
[23:46] move in your lives for your situation
[23:48] James chapter 4 and verse 7 it says
[23:52] submit yourselves therefore to God
[23:56] resist the devil and he will flee from
[23:59] you draw nigh to God and He will draw
[24:03] nigh to you cleanse your hands you
[24:05] sinners and purify your hearts you
[24:07] double-minded be afflicted mourn and
[24:10] weep let your laughter be turned into
[24:12] mourning and your joy to heaviness
[24:14] humble yourself in the sight of the Lord
[24:18] and he shall lift you up
[24:21] amen god bless you can be seated tonight
[24:24] just like to speak to you on this
[24:26] thought submit yourselves therefore to
[24:29] God just looking actually was sent this
[24:33] yesterday by brother Jason Jackson just
[24:36] how the blue sent me this quote and kind
[24:38] of sent me down this this thought path
[24:40] but brother Branham was saying the
[24:42] maniac of Gadara he'd say you can
[24:45] completely submit yourself to the Holy
[24:47] Ghost and no affliction can hold you and
[24:51] you can walk by the power of the Holy
[24:54] Ghost and you are well you give your
[24:58] testimony everything else healed by the
[25:01] power
[25:02] the Holy Ghost he said you that sinful
[25:04] that may drink smoke gamble do things
[25:07] like that you say I can't give them up
[25:09] brother branham yes you can you just
[25:11] submit yourself to God one time you just
[25:14] healed your whole self to him and watch
[25:17] what takes place that's the thing
[25:20] there's no secret to it
[25:21] there's no hocus pocus it's no magical
[25:24] formula
[25:25] it's submitting yourself to God and you
[25:29] man letting him take complete control
[25:31] then it's not you any longer it's the
[25:34] Lord that does it after that Amen and
[25:37] I'm bill I'm glad we have that
[25:38] opportunity today to be able to submit
[25:40] ourselves to the Lord him and I was
[25:42] looking at the scripture here on submit
[25:45] Amen submit yourself to the Lord
[25:48] therefore to God and resist the devil
[25:50] and he will flee from you the submit is
[25:54] to put yourself into subjection to to be
[25:57] subject to submit yourself into its
[26:01] control to yield Amen to obey to be a
[26:04] subject or in a military term it's also
[26:07] to arrange in a military fashion under
[26:10] the command of one leader amen and and
[26:14] and to and to give that leader complete
[26:16] responsibility and complete control and
[26:19] and and you know I believe that's what
[26:21] we're to do in this hour is to submit to
[26:24] him to give him everything you know I as
[26:27] a scripture says whose report will you
[26:29] believe in in other words what what
[26:31] report or what will you submit yourself
[26:34] to or select your felis image your
[26:36] feelings to you or your emotions to or
[26:39] you submit yourself to the doctor's
[26:41] report or will you submit yourself to
[26:43] the emotions or are the senses or who
[26:46] will we give authority or to who or to
[26:49] what will we give authority to let rule
[26:52] over us because we have the the ability
[26:54] to do that amen
[26:56] do we submit ourselves to what someone
[26:58] says or and go under that word of doubt
[27:01] or that word of unbelief or bitterness
[27:03] or do we submit ourselves to what God
[27:06] has said what God has said and what his
[27:09] word declares and and in some in the
[27:11] submitting of ourselves win
[27:13] doing that we are resisting the devil a
[27:16] man we're not allowing him to take
[27:18] control of our emotions lay on him to
[27:20] take control of our thoughts whether it
[27:22] be fear or doubt or anxieties or
[27:24] whatever it is we're not allowing him to
[27:26] how that control and submitting
[27:28] ourselves to him but we're believing the
[27:31] report of the Lord amen and so if we
[27:33] submit our to our thoughts of fear or we
[27:36] submit to our thoughts of anxiety then
[27:39] we're giving that permission to rule
[27:41] over us we're saying you are in control
[27:44] and therefore it has a right to stay
[27:46] there and it gets worse and worse and
[27:48] worse you know the doctor can say
[27:50] something and fear grip us and we submit
[27:53] to it and because our senses says it so
[27:55] are our motion says it so our ears or
[27:58] whatever says it so or we can just say
[28:00] I'm not going to stay I'm not going to
[28:03] stay with what the doctor says I'm going
[28:05] to stay in the arms of Jesus I'm going
[28:07] to allow him to take control because he
[28:10] is a tower of refuge he is there a man
[28:14] is a refuge and you know that but
[28:16] there's no refuge if you don't enter
[28:19] into the refuge you have to submit
[28:21] yourself when they was in the Old
[28:23] Testament they had when it was done
[28:25] something you don't want accident or
[28:26] whatever it was alive an eye for an eye
[28:28] a tooth for a tooth a life for a life
[28:31] and so they had Towe had cities of
[28:33] refuge set up but it wouldn't do no good
[28:36] to have those refuges even though they
[28:38] were there even though you could see
[28:40] them even though you may be in your view
[28:42] but you had to submit yourself to that
[28:45] refuge for that refuge to have rulership
[28:47] over you and therefore amen overrule
[28:50] what the others was trying to do to you
[28:52] and so you were even this even with God
[28:55] we have to come to him we have to take
[28:57] our our emotions we have to take our
[28:59] feelings we have to take our fear our
[29:02] anxiety and just say God I'm not big
[29:04] enough for this I'm not able to take
[29:07] this I'm going to submit myself to you
[29:09] and therefore in that you're resisting
[29:12] the devil and injuries
[29:13] system the devil he has to flee from you
[29:16] he meant so we realized that this refuge
[29:19] is big enough our God is great enough
[29:21] our God is strong enough and he's got it
[29:24] he's more than able he made he's a
[29:27] burden bear
[29:28] he's the Tower of refuge we can run to
[29:30] Jesus Christ you know if you you know
[29:34] and brother but I'm speaking about this
[29:35] and letting off the pressure he says
[29:37] this is a place if you will come and you
[29:40] will escape to Jesus Christ or you will
[29:42] submit yourself to him it is a place
[29:45] where you can come and just let off the
[29:47] steam amen just let off and just relax
[29:50] and and relax into the promise just
[29:53] allow it to take control you know too
[29:55] many times we submit ourselves to what
[29:57] somebody says or we submit ourselves to
[29:59] what a doctor says and we allow that to
[30:01] take control or precedence over what the
[30:04] word says but I mean I believe that this
[30:06] is the time in the hour that we have to
[30:09] say god I'm in the tower of refuge I'm
[30:12] not leaving the tower refuge and this
[30:14] tower refuge segment has government's it
[30:17] has the ability to overrule anything
[30:19] else amen this blood that we were under
[30:22] is a refuge and he has the ability to
[30:25] overrule any kind of sickness any kind
[30:27] of sorrow any kind of thing that goes on
[30:30] in our lives anything that we can't
[30:32] handle he can handle it
[30:33] hallelujah Amen so when you come to
[30:36] Christ into this place of refuge and
[30:38] when a man would come in the Old
[30:39] Testament he'd come he would come in his
[30:41] own free will
[30:43] free will he man he couldn't be made to
[30:45] go there he had to go in his own will
[30:47] and that's the way you had to come to
[30:49] Christ that's the way he meant to submit
[30:51] it's a submitting is to as a free will
[30:54] or heart to give of yourselves and it's
[30:57] not somebody made me do this you know
[30:59] I'm not living a Christian life because
[31:02] somebody's making me live a Christian
[31:04] life I'm living this because I've
[31:06] submitted myself to his rulership and
[31:08] his guidance and so here amen he says
[31:11] and so another thing you must be
[31:14] satisfied while you're there it isn't
[31:18] you can't hang around every day crying
[31:20] while I like to go out there I like to
[31:22] do this
[31:22] he said if you do that they'll put you
[31:24] out of the city he said you must be
[31:26] willing to walk willingly willfully
[31:29] wanting to stay
[31:30] it must said we must be that you want to
[31:33] stay in this city in this refuge a man
[31:37] when you come to Christ you can't look
[31:39] back to the world and say well the Bible
[31:41] says here you know what the Bible said
[31:43] well he that puts his hand to the plow
[31:45] amen and turns back is not worthy of the
[31:47] gospel he said there's so many called
[31:50] so-called Christians that have that they
[31:52] act like they're going to plough but the
[31:54] first thing something comes up and it
[31:56] blows him off the track and and they get
[31:58] sidelined he said but see when you're
[32:00] all pressured up and you don't know
[32:02] what's going to happening you don't know
[32:04] where it's going to go and and maybe
[32:05] maybe death is at the door Amen you know
[32:08] what you got to do you got to run into
[32:10] Christ you got to run into the refuge
[32:13] and then when you get into there you can
[32:16] settle it once and for all
[32:18] amen the pressure can come off of you so
[32:21] no matter what takes place Christ is our
[32:24] refuge amen he is our refuge in the time
[32:27] of storms he's in the refuge in the time
[32:30] of plagues he's in the refuge in the
[32:32] time of the things that were going
[32:34] through individually or as a church body
[32:36] or as a husband or as a wife or as a
[32:38] young person he is our refuge but we
[32:42] have to submit ourselves to him and say
[32:44] god I can't handle it I don't know what
[32:47] to do but you know and you can make a
[32:50] way where there seems to be no way you
[32:52] can turn it around in just a moment you
[32:54] can change it all in just a moment it
[32:57] only takes a just one not one little
[33:00] point of its finger and it's all
[33:01] changing man and so see saying things
[33:05] can happen though and pressures can come
[33:07] and things begin to build up I mean you
[33:10] know it begins to put on pressures in
[33:12] our lives or it's a little age of
[33:13] pressure that we live in Lord knows that
[33:15] a men especially even now seems like
[33:17] more and more and more and more and more
[33:20] but the name of the Lord is a strong
[33:23] tower and I want us to understand this
[33:26] tower it has no limit to its strength
[33:29] and I found this building that we're in
[33:32] or your home that you're in tonight it
[33:34] has a limit to strength there's a
[33:36] - how much it can take even as I limit
[33:39] to how much you know it's why people
[33:40] gets nervous in storms because you know
[33:42] him in your home is only has a certain
[33:44] amount a limit that he can take of winds
[33:47] or hail or or fire or whatever there's
[33:50] so much that he can take it's a refuge
[33:52] in a storm but your house is limited
[33:54] that just building here is limited he
[33:56] can only take so much
[33:58] but this tower that I'm talking about he
[34:00] can come against cancer and it'll hold
[34:02] it'll come against any kind of sickness
[34:04] hitting a cold it'll come against the
[34:06] doctor's report and it can hold he can
[34:08] come against anything there's no limit
[34:11] to the power catch you can get worse
[34:13] sugar diabetes can get worse the devil
[34:15] seem to be everywhere for this pie this
[34:17] tower is still a tower of refuge and
[34:20] there's no limit to its power it's just
[34:23] as powerful today as it ever was
[34:26] hallelujah hey man there's something no
[34:28] matter how much the devil puts against
[34:30] it he can put 200 miles an hour against
[34:32] there 100 he can and let me tell you
[34:35] something the devil on the other hand is
[34:36] limited hallelujah hey man he is limited
[34:41] there's so much he has so much resources
[34:43] he has so much depression he has so much
[34:46] fear he has so much cancer he has he
[34:49] only is limited in his power but this
[34:52] tower that we're talking about has no
[34:54] limits there's never been a storm yet
[34:58] that it didn't hold in there's never
[35:00] been a sickness yet that it didn't stand
[35:02] up against this tower has no limits
[35:06] hallelujah so we see here you said well

[35:33] it to God and go on as if it's all over

[35:44] Refuge

[36:13] branham I've got two sons as doctors as
[36:15] older and you are and honest to goodness
[36:17] she didn't look over 30 years old I said
[36:19] she said here it is here's what it was
[36:22] when I come to Christ when I was 12
[36:24] years old i sat down and thought about
[36:25] him
[36:26] I studied other religions but when I
[36:28] found the true one I came to him and he
[36:32] took my case he took my soul he took my
[36:35] sin he took my whole and I gave it all
[36:38] to him and she said I've never had a
[36:41] worry since well said no he promised me
[36:46] when I gave it to him he would take care
[36:48] of all my troubles and if he's not big
[36:50] enough to do it I know I'm not big
[36:53] enough amen so if he's not big enough
[36:55] what's the use of me worrying about it
[36:58] then in the first place say Christ
[37:00] promised you he would take care of all
[37:03] your cares so submit yourself to him he
[37:07] cares for you he knows what you're going
[37:10] through he knows your struggles he knows
[37:14] your trouble
[37:15] he knows the pressure that we're under
[37:17] he knows all about it
[37:18] amen so resist the devil by submitting
[37:21] to him and saying God you got this you
[37:25] can handle this when I can't handle it
[37:27] and he said when you do quit worrying
[37:29] about it you said well how'd I do it
[37:33] how'd I do all that brother branham just

[38:13] well he said well wait a minute he said

[38:20] Death Angel but you're going to put
[38:21] blood over the door what they do they
[38:23] submitted himself to the blood they
[38:26] submitted himself and in submitting
[38:28] himself there was a resistance to the
[38:30] devil that was on the outside what was
[38:32] that it was a blood that was there
[38:34] amen big black wings started coming
[38:36] through the neighborhoods and people

[39:26] devil to know they say the house made of
[39:28] sticks and stones or or bricks or some
[39:30] wood big bad Wolf's gonna gonna blow it
[39:32] they say what is built out of it's built
[39:35] out of the very fibers of the blood of
[39:37] Jesus Christ and it showed at Calvary
[39:40] it'll hold it showed in death it'll hold
[39:43] it showed in every kind of situation
[39:45] it'll hold the devil ain't got enough
[39:50] hallelujah when I see the blood I'll
[39:53] pass over you some were screaming
[39:55] building up but Israel was relaxing
[39:58] under the promise hey man just resting
[40:01] in the promise when death comes at the
[40:03] door what do you do just rests in the
[40:05] promise doctor may say you're gonna die
[40:07] tomorrow what difference I made the
[40:09] bloods on the post hey man I got a
[40:11] resurrection if I die I got a
[40:12] resurrection coming
[40:14] just be calm he's
[40:15] in control he's governing every move
[40:18] hello somebody he's in control of
[40:21] everything I don't know so what he said
[40:23] in Isaiah at nine and six he said for
[40:25] under us a child is born unto us a son
[40:28] is given the government shall be upon
[40:30] his shoulder he ment so he's taking our
[40:34] cares
[40:35] and he's putting them upon his shoulder
[40:37] what we have need of and listen it's
[40:39] more than just a stimulus check it's
[40:42] more than a temporary thing that's going
[40:44] to run out one day you know I have money
[40:47] one day and it's gone the next I most
[40:48] people spotted stimulus checks already
[40:51] gone was gone before they even got it
[40:52] but in the men there may be some may not
[40:54] be some more coming but of this
[40:56] government listen what he says here the
[41:00] government shall be upon his shoulder
[41:02] and his name shall be called wonderful
[41:05] counsellor the mighty God the
[41:07] everlasting father the Prince of Peace
[41:09] Oh hallelujah and the increase of his
[41:13] government and peace there shall be no
[41:16] end
[41:18] hallelujah listen as we said Satan is
[41:21] limited in power and rulership his
[41:24] rulership can only go so far and for so
[41:26] long he's limited government and
[41:29] rulership has a start date and it has an
[41:31] end date but I God his rulership has no
[41:35] beginning therefore it has no beginning
[41:38] it has no where and if it has no
[41:40] beginning of nowhere it's limitless and
[41:43] power and of the increase there is no
[41:46] end so the devil puts out more sickness
[41:50] God's already got enough the devil puts
[41:53] out more exacting xiety and fear and
[41:56] builds up the pressure God's already got
[41:58] enough hallelujah and one day Satan is
[42:03] going to run out of his power
[42:07] but our God has no limits glory to God
[42:12] in the house
[42:13] hook and somebody say praise the Lord
[42:15] hey man maybe you can say it in your
[42:18] home just as loud as you can
[42:19] praise the Lord my government here in
[42:22] this earth may be limited and they have
[42:24] limited funds and they're way past their
[42:26] limitations the world has passed their
[42:29] limitations but this government there is
[42:31] no limits hallelujah amen this
[42:35] government has enough power in it to
[42:37] heal all cancer to heal every disease to
[42:40] heal ever sin to give us and cure this
[42:43] government has the answer for everything
[42:46] the devil can put at it hallelujah and
[42:49] garden got his chemistries he's chemists
[42:52] in heaven worried about him in the
[42:53] coronavirus and trying to come up with
[42:55] something he's had at 2000 years ago by
[42:58] His stripes I'm healed hallelujah amen
[43:02] it says here and I was here 22 and 22 it
[43:05] says the key of the house of David I'll
[43:07] lay upon his shoulder so hey many so he
[43:10] shall open and no one should shut and he
[43:14] shall shut and none shall open so he has
[43:18] the key to it and so when he clocks the
[43:21] door they ain't nothing that can open it
[43:23] and when he opens the door they ain't
[43:25] nothing that can shut it the devil can
[43:29] come with all his forces but if God's
[43:31] opened the door and there's nothing to
[43:33] be done about it we can see how it
[43:35] wasn't Noah's day when the door shut it
[43:37] wasn't shut by Noah
[43:38] he wasn't shut by man it was shut by God
[43:40] there by Noah couldn't open it he
[43:42] couldn't do nothing about it nobody had
[43:44] no power to open it it was all it was
[43:46] shut by God
[43:47] hey man and woman when God comes on the
[43:50] scene and he moves and he opens a door
[43:53] and he makes a way and he says a certain
[43:56] thing ain't nothing the devil can do
[43:58] about it come on somebody
[44:01] hallelujah they ain't nothing the devil
[44:03] can do it all he might how he might
[44:05] scream he might get all upset I'm sure
[44:08] he will but when God has
[44:10] open the door there's nothing to devil
[44:12] can do about it how many of you was
[44:15] witness when God opened the door and the
[44:17] devil tried to come and he tried to stop
[44:19] any trumpet it wasn't nothing he could
[44:21] do about it
[44:23] hallelujah and I saw an interest meeting
[44:25] the heaven the interest an open door
[44:27] Amen there's been an interest made for a
[44:29] bride to get out of here
[44:32] amen the devil was trying to push and
[44:34] push and keep this little bride down but
[44:37] then the door was not opened by him it
[44:40] was not opened by my mind just an angel
[44:42] it wasn't open by a prophet he was
[44:44] opened by God himself and God made the
[44:47] way out of here and gotta get us safely
[44:49] home and they ain't nothing a devil can
[44:52] do about it he can have he can scream he
[44:55] can say it ain't so he can send bad
[44:58] report after bad report at the bad
[45:00] report it does not matter our God opened
[45:03] the door did you hear me my god open the
[45:07] door and if God opened the dein of devil
[45:10] in hell they can shut it hallelujah
[45:17] he says here the spirit uses his Old
[45:21] Testament reference concerning the Lord
[45:22] Jesus Christ and his ministry in the
[45:25] church what the key of David signifies
[45:30] is the time at that time as a mere
[45:32] shadow which is being fulfilled in Jesus
[45:35] standing in the midst of the lamp stands
[45:38] it has to do with our Lord after his
[45:41] resurrection not as earthly pilgrimage
[45:44] but what does the key signifies the
[45:47] answer lies in the position of the key
[45:50] it's the key is not in his hand it's not
[45:53] worn around his neck it's not placing
[45:56] another man or a verse could not be
[45:58] saying that he alone has the use of the
[46:00] key for he alone opens and shuts and no
[46:03] man has the right but Jesus himself
[46:05] isn't that right but where's the key
[46:07] it's on his shoulder hey man it's only
[46:12] shoulder what do the shoulder have to do
[46:14] about it back to Isaiah nine and six the
[46:17] government shall be upon his shoulder
[46:19] what is
[46:20] mean the answer is this the government
[46:22] is upon his shoulder it comes from a
[46:24] wedding ceremony of these when the bride
[46:27] has been committed to the groom or when
[46:30] she submits herself and she says I do
[46:32] and she takes her fell off and she
[46:35] places it on the groom's shoulder
[46:37] signified that not only she under his
[46:40] Dominion but she's transferred her
[46:43] rights to him and he is the head but
[46:47] also he bears a responsibility whoo
[46:49] hallelujah hi not only is the wife given
[46:54] Amen her so many s of us as the one
[46:57] submit yourself to the Lord but the Lord
[46:59] has said I'm going to take the
[47:01] responsibility of it hallelujah it ain't
[47:05] gonna be for you to try to go make my
[47:07] word come to pass I got the
[47:09] responsibility of doing that I'm gonna
[47:11] bring it to pass if I spoken I'm going
[47:14] to do it
[47:15] amen so see that and that beloved is the
[47:17] key of David God being sovereign he
[47:20] foreknew by the divine Creed exactly who
[47:23] would be in his bride he chose her she
[47:26] did not choose him he called her she did
[47:29] not come on her own he died for her he
[47:32] watched her in his own blood
[47:34] he paid for the price for her she
[47:36] belongs to him oh come on now you need
[47:41] to let the devil know who you belong to
[47:43] I belong to him I belong to Jesus amen
[47:47] and him alone
[47:49] she is wholly committed to him or has
[47:52] submitted herself to him and he accepts
[47:55] the obligation when a man was speaking
[48:00] he said in poverty and wealth and in
[48:03] sickness and in health a man taking a
[48:06] vow God also took the same vow when he
[48:09] took you as his wife he took you as his
[48:12] bride he has taken the obligation if
[48:15] you'll submit to me if you give of
[48:17] yourself to me I'll take care of that
[48:20] just let me have it let me take it this
[48:26] is what he's showing on his shoulder
[48:27] he's bearing your burdens he's bearing
[48:31] your obligations your problems your
[48:33] situation
[48:34] he accepts the obligation he is her head
[48:37] for Christ as the head of his church as
[48:40] Sarah called Abraham Lord even so the
[48:43] bride is happy that he's her Lord he
[48:46] speaks and she obeys for that sort of
[48:48] light he says but I have man heeded this
[48:50] truth no have they esteemed this person
[48:53] who alone has the full sovereignty
[48:55] authority over his church I say no for
[48:57] in every age the church have been
[48:59] governed by hierarchy of priesthood I
[49:01] passed Ollie Secession closing the door
[49:03] mercy and grace all sounded like what's
[49:07] happening in our day to closing the
[49:09] mercy of good Dork mercy and grace of
[49:12] whom it will and instead of assuming the
[49:14] love and responsibility of the church it
[49:16] has with mercenary lust prayed over her
[49:18] and destroy her
[49:19] the clucked clergy lived in luxury while
[49:21] the poor church fed on the husk of abuse
[49:23] and not one age did any different each
[49:25] bound to self an organization and he
[49:28] said that Darin wouldn't let people rise
[49:30] up they were brutally suppressed or cast
[49:32] out every denomination has the same
[49:34] spirit every denomination swears that it
[49:37] has the key to government of the church
[49:39] every denomination claims that it opens
[49:42] the door but that is not truth it is
[49:45] Jesus and Jesus alone
[49:47] he sets the members in the body he
[49:50] endowed them with their ministry he puts
[49:52] the gifts at her disposal he cares for
[49:55] her he guides her she is his sole
[49:58] property and he has no one else but her
[50:02] hallelujah you're the only one God cares
[50:05] about glory to God God cares for you he
[50:10] knows what you're going through
[50:12] let him take care of it cast your cares
[50:16] on him for he careth for you his
[50:22] government has no limitations
[50:25] hallelujah he can buy anybody out of the
[50:29] pawnshop hey man I'm a witness he can
[50:34] pay the highest price he did he gave his
[50:37] own life a man you know when that man
[50:41] wasn't willing to pay that pay the the
[50:44] Ransome for Ruth there was a mighty man
[50:47] of wealth
[50:48] his name was Boaz apparently he had
[50:52] enough money he had enough wealth to
[50:55] take on all her liabilities all of the
[50:58] things that she had all the things that
[51:00] was going on in her life all of her
[51:02] problems all of her struggles and take
[51:04] it on himself a little bride we also

[51:21] life whether it be financial problems or
[51:23] health problems or our sicknesses or
[51:25] doctors reports or whatever the
[51:28] government is on his shoulder he is able

[54:50] hallelujah so he put something in you to
[54:53] hold the line to expect things when it
[54:57] seems impossible there's been people
[55:00] that have reached into realms and
[55:03] believe things that were impossible why
[55:06] because they submitted themselves to
[55:09] what God said it
[55:11] ham would do that our father Abraham was
[55:13] a spiritual see Amen one of the very
[55:15] first examples of somebody who walked
[55:17] with God and because he heard a boy
[55:19] speak to him call him out and take him
[55:21] to a strange land and he started looking
[55:23] for a bit city that was a builder whose
[55:25] builder and maker was God and he started
[55:28] and he started believing in a promise
[55:29] that seemed impossible but what happened
[55:32] as he submitted himself and he allowed
[55:35] himself to relax and he allowed himself
[55:38] to just come into the world
[55:40] then the word started taking over
[55:44] hallelujah that's exactly what I'm you
[55:47] know when you get when you submit
[55:48] yourself to medicine its design medicine
[55:51] goes in your body it goes in and your
[55:53] body submits to it and it allows it to
[55:55] work in certain areas to do certain
[55:57] things to attack certain things even
[55:59] this is what the Word of God does when
[56:01] you take the Word of God of course it's
[56:02] more direct and more perfect it don't
[56:05] have side effects other than cleaning
[56:06] you up and watching you out and taking
[56:09] all the dope smoking and the beer drink
[56:11] and all that stuff out of you that's the
[56:12] side effects enjoy those kind of side
[56:15] effects I feel like it leaves me for the
[56:17] better
[56:17] amen you know and that's what it does it
[56:20] good but as you submit yourself the Holy
[56:23] Spirit begins to take control and begins
[56:25] to move in ways and you begin to expect
[56:27] things that seems unexpectable or
[56:30] unmanned possible amen it gives
[56:32] something in you to when all hell is
[56:34] against you to stand and to hold and to
[56:39] knock back up an inch but to keep
[56:41] pushing forward and to keep pressing a
[56:44] man what is it the Holy Ghost he said
[56:46] that I'll make you happy
[56:48] and I'll make you take all the weirdness
[56:50] and the nervousness from you God said in
[56:53] there the Holy Spirit a comforter Oh
[56:55] hallelujah a comforter to take control
[56:58] of you in situations amen

[57:15] actually by birth make me a renegade
[57:16] that's right I'd be a terrible person a
[57:19] half-breed almost but I found something
[57:21] that
[57:22] took that little room in me and gave me
[57:25] a peace that passes all understanding
[57:28] and I come from death unto life and from
[57:32] darkness unto life and I can never deny
[57:35] what that has done for me hallelujah hey
[57:40] man you know he said he speaks of a over
[57:42] time when his brother Brennan mentioned
[57:43] it about being the one of the worst
[57:45] moments of Eva's life as his little
[57:47] Sharon Rose was dying and was taking her
[57:50] last breath and he was down there
[57:52] speaking to her and asking God to move
[57:55] and he's in God her mama lays yonder no

[58:04] a missing the vision just shut off and
[58:06] in interior and I seem like he's I just
[58:09] take her anyhow and he said so what what
[58:11] happens Satan come to my side and he
[58:14] said usually you're gonna serve Him here
[58:16] you are out on the street corners you
[58:19] fasted so you was so weak you couldn't
[58:22] hardly do your job and climb a telephone
[58:23] pole and what have you done preached and
[58:26] cried and preached and prayed and one
[58:28] word from him would have changed the
[58:29] whole picture and would he do it no he
[58:32] wouldn't do it he let her die and he
[58:35] said see Mike my legs wouldn't hold me
[58:37] up no longer and I said Sheree you know
[58:39] daddy
[58:40] and here we zijn like knowing she was
[58:42] dying I thought just one word just one
[58:45] word I walked over to the back I didn't
[58:48] Satan come again said will you continue
[58:49] to serve Him and I thought we will where
[58:52] would I go if I didn't serve Him what
[58:54] would I do if I didn't serve Him where
[58:57] would my hope be if I didn't serve Him
[58:58] and something happened to me I walked
[59:02] over to the bed and I put my hands in
[59:05] their little head now he had an
[59:06] opportunity are you which one are you
[59:08] going to submit to who are you going to
[59:11] give into he said but something happened
[59:13] to me I said darlin God gave you and God
[59:16] took you away taking you away blessed be
[59:19] the name of the Lord though you slay me
[59:21] yet I'll trust you I'll take your
[59:23] daughter to lay it under your mother's
[59:24] arm they undertake it more an hour from
[59:27] now but yet if he kills me and theirs
[59:29] then I can go to he's the only hope I
[59:32] ever found he's the only foundation I
[59:35] ever had to stand on and he's the only
[59:37] comforter I ever had and where and how
[59:40] will I go for a comforter unless it was
[59:42] him and at that moment the angels came
[59:44] and packed her away but in that moment
[59:46] he was my comforter he came to me and he
[59:51] cared for me hallelujah the Brandon
[1:00:04] would speak many times about crisis what
[1:00:07] we do in the time of crisis
[1:00:10] he said if wheels just stand God you ask
[1:00:16] the question will God answer in a time
[1:00:19] of crisis he said he will not only
[1:00:22] answer but he will make manifest in the
[1:00:27] time of crisis he will make himself
[1:00:30] manifest in the time of crisis we can
[1:00:34] see that all the way down through the
[1:00:35] Bible we can see how even you know Moses
[1:00:39] when he come to the Red Sea what was it
[1:00:41] in the time of crisis God came on the
[1:00:43] scene and opened up the way well you see
[1:00:46] Joshua as he would fight there in that
[1:00:48] valley I wrote through that valley
[1:00:50] that's at the setting of the son of my
[1:00:52] time in Israel took a picture of it seen
[1:00:54] it today my wife come and showed me the
[1:00:56] picture again as we rode through that
[1:00:58] valley same valley and robbed maybe at
[1:01:00] the same time just as the Sun was going
[1:01:02] down and snapped a picture of it and
[1:01:05] here Joshua was fighting the battle and
[1:01:07] he's in the time of crisis and and you
[1:01:09] don't you don't know what to do at the
[1:01:11] moment but it was in that moment
[1:01:13] something manifested and he spoke he
[1:01:17] spoke things that even now don't make
[1:01:19] sense humanly speaking it's the
[1:01:22] scientists would argue and this was that
[1:01:24] would argue and whatever people with my
[1:01:26] eyes a bunch of nonsense it don't make
[1:01:28] sense humanly speaking but God's
[1:01:30] speaking it makes sense when God speaks
[1:01:34] things happens and he might use the
[1:01:36] voice of a mortal man to speak
[1:01:38] say son stand still and moves hands
[1:01:41] still aim it wasn't it was in the time
[1:01:43] of crisis amen Joshua submitted himself
[1:01:46] to the thinking of God and God came on
[1:01:49] the scene and gave him victory over
[1:01:51] those kings hallelujah
[1:01:55] who are you want to submit yourself to
[1:01:56] are you going to submit yourself to the
[1:01:58] word are you going to keep going down
[1:02:00] that trail of fear and trail of anxiety
[1:02:03] and trail of all kind of things that
[1:02:05] going through your mind and your mind
[1:02:06] running rapid what are you going to say
[1:02:08] god I can't do nothing about it I'm just
[1:02:10] gonna submit to you this is what he was
[1:02:16] saying that quote I love - I love the
[1:02:17] quote he said if everyone in here would
[1:02:19] just begin to think think God is God
[1:02:25] what are you doing you're submitting
[1:02:28] yourself to something what one time you
[1:02:31] was thinking about this or thinking
[1:02:33] about that or this fear that's problem
[1:02:35] or mama here that daddy over here all
[1:02:37] kind of issues but all of a sudden you
[1:02:39] start submitting yourself to something
[1:02:41] else God is God and if God is God his
[1:02:47] word don't change he spoke it it don't
[1:02:51] change he said it it don't change it was
[1:02:56] him that said it not me
[1:02:59] come on somebody it was him that spoke
[1:03:02] it not me
[1:03:04] it was him that came in these rooms here
[1:03:07] not me it was him that moved in possible
[1:03:11] situation not me so if God said it he
[1:03:15] spoke it he will bring it to pass God is
[1:03:19] God and if God is God his word don't
[1:03:24] change he's the same yesterday today and
[1:03:27] forever and he's not lost one ounce of
[1:03:30] power or one ability to save or one mile
[1:03:34] a moment to change a life in a moment in
[1:03:36] a twinkling of an eye he's that kind of
[1:03:38] God
[1:03:44] he says no matter how religious you are
[1:03:48] how many churches belong to him any
[1:03:49] books your names on if that genuine Holy
[1:03:52] Ghost is in you which is the word
[1:03:54] manifested you'll see the message in the
[1:03:57] hour because as the Holy Ghost that does
[1:03:59] it and there has to be something like
[1:04:01] that something like that that often
[1:04:04] inspiration strike you he says if you
[1:04:07] pull water on the ground on the ground
[1:04:08] on the ground there's no seed there to
[1:04:10] strike how can I ever bring forth
[1:04:11] anything if there's nothing there to
[1:04:13] bring forth but that only the elect of
[1:04:15] God will see it the electorate of God
[1:04:17] seen it Noah's time Moses time Jesus
[1:04:20] time Apostles time Luther's time
[1:04:22] Wesley's time Pentecostal time because
[1:04:24] it was a seed that was on the earth that
[1:04:26] when this inspiration was poured out he
[1:04:28] meant what was that they came under they
[1:04:30] subjected themselves to it they
[1:04:32] submitted themselves to it and something
[1:04:35] began to take form in them something
[1:04:38] begin to take place in them just like
[1:04:39] the woman that was walking down there a
[1:04:41] little teenage girl walking down to the
[1:04:43] well and an angel came down and she
[1:04:46] began to speak Mary highly favorite of
[1:04:49] God amen what was it she began to submit
[1:04:51] her so maybe was just thinking about all
[1:04:53] kinds of things but all of a sudden her
[1:04:55] cheeks their thinking changed
[1:04:56] I believe my thinking would change to
[1:04:59] ulsan the blinding light came down and
[1:05:02] out of that ball of light stepped an
[1:05:03] angel about six foot and one six foot
[1:05:05] around their halogen dark eyes Amen with
[1:05:08] his arms folded hello somebody what
[1:05:14] would happen in your house is right in
[1:05:15] him all of a sudden the ball of light
[1:05:17] and out of a stepped a man your thinking
[1:05:23] would change you think it would change
[1:05:30] inspiration would take you to my
[1:05:32] feelings whoo yeah lots of feelings no
[1:05:37] doubt sparks I had never had to play
[1:05:39] privilege of seeing that ball of light
[1:05:41] but I felt him when he came by hair
[1:05:46] stand up on top of your head seemed like
[1:05:49] charged on every haver way this happened
[1:05:52] a few minutes ago right there
[1:05:53] study as you begin to sing that song
[1:05:56] he'll do it again
[1:06:00] things change its voracious strikes but
[1:06:05] it's usually and at these times of
[1:06:07] crisis when the press is on you listen
[1:06:10] to brother Brando
[1:06:11] when the press is on you look around
[1:06:13] look at the condition we're living in
[1:06:15] don't we not the modern Sodom and
[1:06:18] Gomorrah the world's come back to it
[1:06:19] again Gentile worlds was restored then
[1:06:22] didn't Jesus say in Luke 17 chapter as
[1:06:24] it was in the days of Sodom sort of
[1:06:26] being the coming of the Son of Man the
[1:06:28] Son of man and being revealed what has
[1:06:30] revealed the secrets made known
[1:06:32] revelation is to reveal to make known a
[1:06:34] secret these things has been here
[1:06:36] through all the church ages now being
[1:06:38] revealed he said you see God interpreted
[1:06:40] word God don't need anybody interpreters
[1:06:42] word he's his own interpreter he said a
[1:06:44] virgin shall conceive and she did he
[1:06:46] said let there be light and there was
[1:06:48] and here we are not in Luther's Wesley
[1:06:51] Pentecostal and we're all those agents
[1:06:54] were living in the evening time we're
[1:06:56] living in a time of the calling out of
[1:06:57] the bride he said just as it was hard
[1:06:59] for the Catholics to see Luther and
[1:07:01] Luther to see Wesley and Wesley see the
[1:07:03] Pentecost is hard for the Pentecostals
[1:07:05] to see this age it's always been that
[1:07:07] way because it's poured out upon the
[1:07:09] elected see a man is what the bible
[1:07:12] teaches they can't see it jesus even
[1:07:14] prayed for him said there was blind they
[1:07:16] didn't know it revelation says tells us
[1:07:18] this and Laodicean Church ages naked
[1:07:21] poor miserable blind don't even know it
[1:07:23] back again so creeped up in their
[1:07:25] tradition but remember the promised Word
[1:07:27] of God by the mouth of Jesus Christ the
[1:07:30] very God that spoke creation existence
[1:07:32] he was a Warren before the foundation of
[1:07:35] the world that said let there be and it
[1:07:37] was but he said he was in the world the
[1:07:39] world was made by him in the world knew
[1:07:40] him not but as many as didn't know him
[1:07:42] to them he gave power to become the sons
[1:07:45] of God the very creator the very creator
[1:07:49] himself that raised up lives from the
[1:07:51] dead he said think that's not strange
[1:07:53] for the earth coming when all that's in
[1:07:55] the grave will hear the voice of the son
[1:07:58] of man and shall come out again we're
[1:08:00] living in
[1:08:01] day it's the same God that said let
[1:08:04] there be light and it was the voice of
[1:08:06] the Son of Man would wait those in his
[1:08:09] grade and it's happening in his season
[1:08:11] he spoken let there be male and be
[1:08:14] female and it happened years hundreds of
[1:08:16] years before it happened an inspiration
[1:08:19] struck a prophet I said and said of
[1:08:21] virgin shall conceive unto us a child is
[1:08:23] born a son is given his name shall be
[1:08:26] called counselor Prince of Peace mighty
[1:08:28] God the everlasting father years passed
[1:08:31] months past years days weeks years
[1:08:34] hundreds of years eight hundred years
[1:08:36] later Emmanuel came forth borne by a
[1:08:39] virgin what was it he spoken it had to
[1:08:42] happen but it was in those real hours of
[1:08:45] real stress that's usually when the
[1:08:51] Spirit of God moves in oh hallelujah
[1:08:56] don't be looking at covet nineteen be
[1:08:58] looking for the Spirit of God don't be
[1:09:02] looking at government problems and this
[1:09:03] problem and financial problem be looking
[1:09:05] for the Spirit of God amen it's what
[1:09:09] happened he let the Hebrew children walk
[1:09:11] right into the fiery furnace but who did
[1:09:12] they submit themselves to they submit
[1:09:15] themselves to God said King live forever
[1:09:19] whatever but we're not gonna bow we're
[1:09:22] not gonna do we're not gonna bow when
[1:09:24] I'm gonna worship our God can deliver us
[1:09:27] and even if he don't we're not going to
[1:09:31] bow he let the Hebrew children listen to
[1:09:36] this he let the Hebrew children walk
[1:09:40] right to the fiery furnace before he
[1:09:43] ever moved a hand but when he moves he
[1:09:49] moves
[1:09:55] allelujah when he moves he moves and
[1:10:00] they nothing to devil can do about it
[1:10:04] governments then couldn't stop him from
[1:10:06] coming they tried to build a fire enough
[1:10:08] to kill somebody but it couldn't stop
[1:10:10] the King of Kings from coming on the
[1:10:12] scene and changing the whole situation
[1:10:15] in just a moment the King bowed down and
[1:10:18] said hey then we throw three men in that
[1:10:20] fire is that yes can we throw three
[1:10:22] million in five but I see forward me and
[1:10:25] walking around unbound and then hurt and
[1:10:27] unharmed hallelujah the devil say hey I
[1:10:32] thought we had three of them in there
[1:10:34] but now there's four and everything we
[1:10:36] don't try to do hasn't harmed them and
[1:10:39] stopped them has empowered them hadn't
[1:10:41] destroyed them but they're still walking
[1:10:43] in the promises of God and they're being
[1:10:45] led by the chief captain and ain't
[1:10:48] nothing the devil can do about it I
[1:10:50] suppress ever onward we're not busy
[1:10:54] we're not bowing we're holding the line
[1:10:56] do what you got to do devil that God is
[1:11:00] greater do what you got to do devil our
[1:11:03] God has the answer our God is more than
[1:11:05] table for whatever you can throw at us
[1:11:08] our God is an awesome God when he moves
[1:11:13] he moves and all the devils have to
[1:11:17] tremble and free flee Moses and a crisis
[1:11:21] cried out and God said stand still and
[1:11:24] see the salvation of God and maybe our
[1:11:29] arch trouble tonight may you hear the
[1:11:32] words of God stand still submit yourself
[1:11:36] to God resist the devil and he will flee
[1:11:39] from you see God move the inspiration
[1:11:47] struck the prophet and their time of
[1:11:50] crisis an inspiration that's the way it
[1:11:53] strikes you if you're sick as the way it
[1:11:55] strikes you if you're afflicted
[1:11:56] something's revealed to you and when you
[1:11:59] see it revealed you speak up
[1:12:02] and you say I'm healed hallelujah all
[1:12:07] glory to God I remember what happened to
[1:12:09] sister Lily Petter solely in our service
[1:12:11] over the old church amen brother Tim was
[1:12:14] preaching on anointing to speak and here
[1:12:16] she was going to the kneading of surgery
[1:12:18] and having that problem in her in her
[1:12:20] back there and ending and she stood up
[1:12:23] right in front of me and my wife she
[1:12:25] said I'm healed in the name of Jesus
[1:12:27] Christ and God came on the scene all
[1:12:33] vegan some people just just just submit
[1:12:35] yourself to God and see what happens and
[1:12:37] when that inspiration strikes speak Amen
[1:12:42] you're saying and it'll happen come on
[1:12:45] somebody that's exactly what happened to
[1:12:47] Haddie right Amen if she got it on the
[1:12:49] influence of what the Prophet was
[1:12:50] speaking and he was telling her about
[1:12:52] the squirrels that was being created and
[1:12:54] all that taking place and she realized
[1:12:56] this is more than just some kind of
[1:12:58] fairy tale this is nothing but the truth
[1:13:01] don't you know those words whirled
[1:13:03] around in her frontal lobe who knows how
[1:13:05] long but all of a sudden she couldn't
[1:13:07] contain it no more and something come
[1:13:10] out of her and said brother Branham
[1:13:11] that's nothing but the truth he said
[1:13:15] what happened the age of the Lord fell
[1:13:17] in the place it said give her the
[1:13:20] desires of our whatever she asked hello
[1:13:24] he couldn't ask say that unless he could
[1:13:27] back it up whatever she asked so in
[1:13:33] other words whatever she was going to
[1:13:35] ask wasn't going to be too big you you
[1:13:38] understand what I'm saying
[1:13:39] she couldn't ask something big enough
[1:13:42] because he said whatever she asks come
[1:13:47] on now Oh God
[1:13:49] listen this government has no
[1:13:50] limitations this government is unlimited
[1:13:54] so he can say whatever you ask I'll give
[1:13:57] it to you this is why he would say ask
[1:14:00] anything in my name and I'll give it to
[1:14:02] you in other words he has the power for
[1:14:06] whatever you ask he has the ability for
[1:14:09] whatever you ask and he meant God come
[1:14:11] on the scene we know what she asks you
[1:14:13] could ask for the healing
[1:14:14] sister she could ask for money she was a
[1:14:17] poor lady but she asked for the
[1:14:18] salvation of her two boys and they fell
[1:14:21] over that you talk about uh greatest the
[1:14:24] greatest price but yet God was able to
[1:14:28] answer incredible
[1:14:31] what one soul was worth ten thousand
[1:14:33] worlds but God was still able to answer
[1:14:38] mercy we said Joshua an hour of crisis
[1:14:43] armies was being routed son was going
[1:14:45] down he knew if it went down they'd have
[1:14:50] a chance to unite again and come against
[1:14:52] him and he would lose more men so in the
[1:14:54] hour of crisis something had to be done
[1:14:56] if he could keep them running here to
[1:14:59] rout them every one though it wasn't
[1:15:01] like to do it so Joshua stood and raised
[1:15:05] his hands
[1:15:06] it said son stand still and moon hanging
[1:15:10] over a Jelani till I get through with
[1:15:12] this battle and the son stood when
[1:15:15] Joshua spoke of course it was a paradox
[1:15:18] seemed like something impossible to take
[1:15:20] place but God did it anyhow perhaps
[1:15:23] gospel never tried to figure it out how
[1:15:25] it's going to do how God was going to do
[1:15:27] it only thing he said was stand still
[1:15:30] same he said the same thing in mark
[1:15:34] 11:23 if you say to this mountain be
[1:15:38] moved and don't doubt in your heart but
[1:15:40] believe what you said will come to pass
[1:15:42] you can have what you say hello he
[1:15:47] didn't put limitations on that you know
[1:15:50] I have yet to find in the Bible any kind
[1:15:52] of fine print as you find on contracts
[1:15:55] you know what I'm talking about just had
[1:15:58] one just the other day offer to me a
[1:16:00] needed a frigerator repair and Sears
[1:16:02] came out with a and Ian want to sell me
[1:16:04] a whole house plan of all my appliances
[1:16:08] and I asked her I said well what's the
[1:16:10] fine print she said well you just have
[1:16:13] to read that it's there and I said yeah
[1:16:15] I know about these warranties they all
[1:16:17] got their fine prints they'll pay too
[1:16:19] you need them to pay right yeah they'll
[1:16:23] pay yeah they pay pay until you need
[1:16:25] them to pay then they won't pay
[1:16:26] hey man but this
[1:16:28] we'll pay and pay and pay and he's paid
[1:16:32] for thousands of generations hundreds
[1:16:35] over and over and over and hasn't run
[1:16:40] out yet and I hadn't seen no fine print
[1:16:43] that says speak to this mountain
[1:16:46] whatever you say shall come to pass and
[1:16:49] he shall have whatsoever he says it
[1:16:54] don't say under there well fine print
[1:16:57] you know the real fast I can't talk that
[1:16:59] fast how they did but you know spit it
[1:17:01] all out so you can't understand all the
[1:17:03] things that they came they can't cover
[1:17:04] and they won't cover and they've another
[1:17:05] land he's go down this long no as I said
[1:17:09] he's the Lord God that heals all the
[1:17:12] diseases he covers all sins he hasn't
[1:17:17] found one yet he can't forgive he hasn't
[1:17:20] found one sickness yet he can't heal a
[1:17:22] man is unlimited submit yourself he says
[1:17:26] see he said see we can't you can't just
[1:17:29] stand there and fumble in your mind and
[1:17:31] say say it you got to be inspired to say
[1:17:34] it but when you're inspired say it speak
[1:17:38] it see what God to do see what God to do
[1:17:42] and move on your behalf so look at
[1:17:45] looking on down here seeing here Joshua
[1:17:53] in this moment didn't know exactly where
[1:17:58] to turn or how to turn maybe you'll find
[1:18:02] yourself that way tonight you don't you
[1:18:04] heard something to dr. sadder you got
[1:18:06] some situation going on and you don't
[1:18:09] know right now's the time to just submit
[1:18:13] yourself to God I realize he's he's got
[1:18:17] the answer to this humbled myself and he
[1:18:23] will lift you up
[1:18:24] he will lift you up higher than you
[1:18:26] could ever lift yourself up or any
[1:18:29] government can lift you up or any kind
[1:18:30] of thing could ever lift you up the ego
[1:18:32] he'll lift you up higher maybe you find
[1:18:35] yourself an impossible situation through
[1:18:39] Hebrew children all these others down to
[1:18:42] the Bible a little woman who touched the
[1:18:45] hem of His garment you know I was
[1:18:50] listening to that first service they

[1:19:05] but that little woman made that moment
[1:19:09] her moment appropriated faith Jesus was
[1:19:15] on his way down to another place he'd
[1:19:17] been called to another to a death and
