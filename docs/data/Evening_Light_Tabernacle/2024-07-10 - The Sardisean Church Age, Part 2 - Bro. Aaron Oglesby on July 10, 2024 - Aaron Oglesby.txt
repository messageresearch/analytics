people I pray father we ask these things in Jesus name amen amen amen if you have your Bibles with you and you would turn with me to the Book of Revelation chapter 3 tonight we're gonna take a look into our Church age study and go through some of the um sardan Church Age and and this will actually be part two of that study we did part one with the young people so some of this as we go we don't have anything on the screen uh some of this there as we go might seem like we're moving pretty quick to some of you uh but to those that were here it'll seem like a review so at the beginning we're GNA we're going to move quickly through this we're looking Revelation three and we're going to read down through verse 6 says and unto the angel of the church in sord is right these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God the Seven Stars I Know Thy works that thou Hast a name that thou livest and art dead Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God remember therefore how thou Hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee thou Hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white rment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches amen I pray that the Lord add His blessings as you take your seat as they're working on these technical issues I do know that there is a setting that they have to change every time because this is Powerpoint and they have to switch that every time so if we can get that so we're looking at the sardan church age and um hopefully we'll have visuals here soon it's it's from the time of 1520 through the year 1750 it is the fifth age and Sardis was an ancient city that was the capital of Lydia and in the days of of Emperor tiberious it was desolated by earthquakes and plagues the Roman and Greek historians of the time period said it was the greatest Earth quake in human history it struck in in ad. 17 and and if you think about it when you see these historical events that you and you can place them in biblical times this was in ad17 so this event would have taken place during the life of Jesus Christ while he was here on Earth and and as a matter of fact it was Tiberius who was the Roman Emperor at the time of Jesus's crucifixion and so this major earthquake struck and destroyed many of the city ities there in Asia Minor and and Sardis actually never would recover from this and and as we look at this you know we we look at the the way the Holy Spirit worked I is he would take a city and and he would see the the the attributes of that City and and he would call it out and place it in the Scripture A as a to represent a period of time or a church Age and and and as we look at this in Sardis Sardis was carrying on the mother and Son worship that that had carried over from Babylonian times with the worship of cbel and her son diois and she was known as the Queen of Heaven and her son was known as the Lord of Heaven she was the revealer of mercy and he the revealer of Truth they held the keys together to the afterlife and as we've gone through this study each time we we've pointed out and focused on the origins of the mother and son worship down through history and the reason that we've done this is to make it clear where the traditions of Catholicism come from all right these these come These Are pagan Traditions they're not based in the Bible at all uh but they're Pagan traditions and Pagan ideas that were blended with Christianity by the polytheistic Romans and and as time goes on and and Christianity grew the Pagan Rome became Papa Rome and in this time Pagan Rome just intertwined all their Traditions with Christian teachings and they plugged in the names of Mary and Jesus and continued right on with mother and son worship but this never was something you find in the Bible this is something you find in Pagan Traditions down through history and and we see in Sardis what ends up happening is is their religion gets to the place where it's Cel the mother alone who gets all the praise and glory and honor and suddenly where it was at least Mother's Son suddenly son's getting none of the worship and it's all being bestowed upon the mother all the wor is being bestowed there and brother Bram says here he says all one needs to do is go over her various titles talking about Mary and recall the lovely attributes that are accorded to her by the Roman Church to understand where the religion of this age came from so we see that the the mother's son worship has has evolved to a place where it's more of a mother worship and it becomes mariolatry she is the one that has lifted up and it elevates the mother to a place with power and authority and a a place to be worshiped and a place to be prayed to as though she is deity and at the same time what this does is it they're elevating the woman the church they're they're elevating the church to a place near the church who's supposed to be be a woman who is under headship the church a woman who is supposed to be subject to Christ her husband subject to to Christ the word but they they they elevate her to a place above her husband above the word to where their Creeds is what matters their dogmas is what matters you don't necessarily have to look to what the word says or what the husband says but they've elevated the woman to a place of worship but she the church elevates her opinions over whatever the word says and so during this age we we we see that for the first time there is a real break away from the Catholic Church as is what we know as the the the Protestant Reformation and and those who break away begin to turn their worship away from the church away from what the Bishops say and they begin to come back to the word of God they began to turn their their their all their worship and and and pray ra to Faith in the Son of God and of this age we know the messenger is is Martin Luther and Martin Luther lives from 1483 to to 1546 and he's raised in Germany and he's educated in Latin at a young age and he he goes to University and enters into law school and it was during this time that he begins to search his life concerning his own spiritual condition and he leaves law school after after only six weeks and he enters into Monastery and and Luther becomes a priest and and and he becomes very respected for his understanding and for all his teaching on the word and yet still in all of this he did not have the peace or the satisfaction of Salvation he longed for it he says here he says though I lived as a monk without reproach think about that he can say without reproach he says I felt that I was a sinner before God with an extremely Disturbed conscience what was it we we've all been there no matter how good we're doing no matter what we try to do we just don't feel good enough and he says I had an extremely Disturbed conscience he he had lived a life of great of great Penance he had given up worldly pleasure he he had worked so hard to be good enough and yet all the rule following all the lining up all all the Penance all the self-sacrifice and yet he knew I still fall short I'm still not good enough he he knows that no matter what I do I'm still not righteous and his heart is crying out Lord what more can I do what what more can I do to to experience salvation where where can I turn his own testimony would declare that he was meditating day and night seeking God how can I ever measure up how how can we ever get to the place of Salvation how can I ever be good enough and he says in these times it finally struck him Romans 1:17 for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith at is as it is written the just shall live by faith Galatians 3:11 but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God it is evident for the just shall live by faith brother renam says the Evangelical truth of this scripture flooded his mind and he was set free from sin and he was born into the kingdom of God listen when you get to the place that you recognize I'm not good enough I can't do enough I can't line up enough I can't cross every tea and Dot every eye good enough but the only way I'm ever going to be good enough is by faith in the sacrifice the perfect one who shed his blood for me that's when you experience salvation that's when you experience the joy of your burdens being lifted cuz it ain't about you anymore and your goodness and your works and what you can do but it's what he has already done for you he began to preach and to defend the scriptures with a burning passion the word was his was his focus and the word alone because it was the word that had set him free and in so keeping with the word he soon finds that by staying with the word he comes in open conflict with the church because you can't line up with the church and line up with the word here in the denominational church because they don't go together and at first he wasn't even trying to come against the church he he his own writings was just would indicate he was just trying to stick with the word but it was the church that was straying away from that word and so they become an open conflict and and he writes what becomes known as the 95 thesis it says thus when Leo the 10th became Pope and John tetel came to sell indulgences for sin Luther had no choice but to rise up against this antis scriptural teaching first he thundered from the pull pit against it and then he wrote his famous 95 thesis which on October 31st 1517 he nailed to the door of the castle church and what was this 95 thesis it it detailed Luther's opposition to what he saw as the Catholic Church's abuse and Corruption by Catholic clergy who were selling indulgences which were certificates supposed to reduce the punishment in purgatory for the sins committed by the purchasers or their loved ones and and and they're selling these to where it doesn't matter if you sin you you've already you've already paid for it you've bought the right to sin you have paid for this so you could even buy indulgences for sin future this wasn't even buying forgiveness it was saying I have a right to go and do whatever I want because I've already paid the church and I'm free to do whatever they were paying that they could sin and he rises up against this and he said and he even he would teach that what this did he said is it did away with true repentance in the heart of Christians it did away with with a true dying out because you didn't have to die out to sin you didn't have to be sorry for sin you could just pay the church and keep living exactly how you wanted to live and he cries out against it and and and history tells us that immediately immediately Rome perceived him as a threat listen as soon as you stand up for truth the devil recognize you as a threat as soon as you say I'm not backing off this this is the word of God this is the truth this is the revealed word of the hour prepare to come under attack because he recognizes that you are a threat to his kingdom there were calls for him to be excommunicated and for him to be burned at the stake his Fame and his teaching spread like wildfire and with it so did the Protestant Reformation I'm going to actually go ahead and try to use this now the Reformation in a short time Germany was Ablaze and the Reformation was on so what is the Reformation it was a movement in which Christians protested the Catholic church and began trying to reform the Church and it resulted in the beginning of protestantism brother brandham said God's time was ripe for a definite move that would be the beginning of the restoration of the church now as you study this and if you read through the church age book yourself you'll find where brother brandham points out the shortcomings and the flaws of this movement and he says they fell short and there was even flaws in Luther and different things but he says this it was the beginning of the restoration it was a move of god notice it wasn't everything but this was the beginning this was the starts of it you know you've been taught well and you and you know of the four beasts and the four anointings for each day the lion the ox the man and the eagle and what the Reformation was this was the age of man this was the anointing of man the day of the reformers where man's education and man's advancements and Technology allowed for the spreading of the word there were things like the printing press that that that came out as a a new invention and allowed for for for pamplets and sermons and essays and allowed for the Bible once again to be put in the hand of common men so it was no longer the church saying this is what it says but you could look at it for yourself and read it for yourself there were Generations there was thousands I may say millions of people who never one time had the opportunity to ever open up this book to ever read it for themselves they had no idea what was in it other than what the priest told them what was in it but now all of a sudden every man has access to it every woman has access to it it was a mighty move of God God putting it back in the hands of his people it was a powerful time as anointed men rose up and began to reform what they saw as wrong but the prophet would say it was an unfulfilled age they could have and should have pressed further into restoration instead of just settling for a Reformation they settled for a re and that the Bible tells us here in Revelation 3 And1 says I Know Thy works that thou has a name that thou livest and art dead in verse two speaking in this age he says for I have not found thy works perfect before God now in most of the ages the spirit would praise the True Vine and then he would denounce the false Vine so there would be praised along with the denunciation but here the entire message to the fifth age is a message of condemnation the entire thing there's no praise given there there's none given because yet many men rose up great anointed men to spread the message and yet as great as they were and as great as the move was their minds were still tainted by Catholicism their mind was still tainted by what they came out of yes they had more word yes they were closer to the truth but they pattered themselves after their mother the Catholic church instead of starting a new instead of building fresh building on the word they built on the foundations of Rome instead of taking this truth and starting over and and and instead of starting from scratch they tried to fix the church that was there they tried to fix the problems and what they ended up doing was taking the truth that they have and mixing it with the error that they already had so now they just have truth and error mixed and right here in this time as they're trying to break free and they're they're trying to break away from Rome they're trying to find their way to freedom and right here in the midst of that they're snared by denomination they begin to split hairs over doctrines they begin to make camps along lines of disagreement and you see the attitude of the Corinthians begin to rise up that I am of Paul and I am of sephus it begins to Splinter the body well well who's going to be the most influential leader who's the most influential reformer which one is the most right and they begin to devour one another and fight one another more bitterly than they fought against the Catholic Church listen as a message Community we can't turn into that to where we begin to fight one another over our differences instead of uniting around the things that we have the same there's a glorious message that has called us out and we have one goal and that's to take a Rapture and we get to a place where we're fighting and we're bickering and we're pointing well this church says this and this church says that listen let me put it to you like this to settle the issue I might be wrong sometimes you might be wrong sometimes ministers at other churches might be wrong sometimes but the message is right the message is always right it is the truth that is the revealed word for the day so don't get caught up in this and that just remember the message is the truth it is the truth quotes don't fight quotes our understanding of quotes fights other men's understanding of quotes but quotes do not contradict one another they never have they can't they begin to devour one another and fight one another another and commenius wrote each Church reckons itself as the true one or at least as the purest truest part of it all part of it while among themselves they persecute each other with the bitterest hatred of the new birth and how a man must be changed into the likeness of Christ to become a partaker of the divine nature scarcely anything is said May that never be said about our church May that never be said in the ranks of the message that the new birth isn't focused on listen brother Bram comes and he preaches the token and he says it's the highlight of my Ministry the token the New Birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost it must be preached it must be what we attain to it must be what we strive for but he says it got to the place where scarcely anything was said he says the faith has been split into a thousand little parts and you're made a heretic if there is one of them you do not accept what can help only the one thing needful return to Christ looking to Christ as the only leader and walking in his footsteps setting aside all other ways until we all reach the goal and have come to the unity of the faith that's one thing Satan can't stand and he doesn't want is for us to be unified in our faith listen if one can chase a th and two 10,000 he wants to keep you separated he doesn't want you binding your faith together and recognizing no matter our differences you are my brother you are my sister we have one common goal we are to be unified in the faith and he battles that and he fights against that he said the faith has been split into a thousand little parts and the spirit of God finds it deplorable he finds it deplorable and by the second generation they're right back under the wing of the Catholic Church going right back to the prison that they had just been freed from they elevated churches they lifted up the names of great great men they became lutherans God wasn't wanting lutherans he was wanting Christians don't ever settle for I'm in the message or I go to evening light Tabernacle or this is my pastor God's not looking for that he's looking for Christians for people sold out and dedicated to him and him alone filled with the spirit living for him shining a light say he's the same yesterday today and forever [Music] Christians that's what he's looking for he's looking for people that are sold out people that stand for him lives dedicated to him someone who is identified with him so that on that day he may identify himself with them that's what I want is for him on that day to identify himself with me amen he's not going to ask a one of us where we went to church he's not going to ask you did you believe the message he's looking for the blood tag he's looking for the Seal of God the token of God do you have it that's what he's looking for God rebukes the age because he had made a way of escape and they tasted that freedom but they didn't go all the way if there's a theme to our study tonight what we're talking about tonight it's we got to go all the way we cannot stop short but we must go all the way that's why there's no praise that's given as he addresses the church only condemnation because they chained themselves right back to what they came out of yes many great things were done yes it was a mighty move yes it was the beginning of the restoration but they failed to take on his name they became lutherans and Calvinists and Armenians they took on the names of churches they were living a name but they were dead the eulogy in Revelation 3 and4 says Thou Hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy now we know that there's two V finds the true and the false the false but here we see God is speaking to the church in this age the true and the false lump together as the church he's addressing them all at once and and even though he has rebuked the entire age in this moment he says there are a few names all right he says there are a few there there there's a few names there's some who are right even though the whole age is is full of error there is a little minority group that has stayed true he says he he says there is a group that would not compromise and that group I'm going to reward they're going to walk with me they're going to be robed in white yes it had been a chaotic age it had been a rebuked age it had been an unfulfilled age and the word even declared that what they had was getting ready to die it was getting ready to die but in the midst of all that he says everything ain't lost I got some names I got a few people that no matter how dark it's getting down there they're still staying true no matter how dark it's getting they're still shining the light they're following the light of the revealed day they're standing they're identifying with me they're true to me and I'm going to reward them he says I've got a people and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy Prophet God says for they shall walk with him and and white they had identified themselves with him on Earth and now he would identify himself with them in the New Jerusalem and how marvelous will be that identification how awesome is this you were identified with him on Earth and he's saying now I'm going to identify myself with you in the New Jerusalem It's a Wonderful thought that no matter what the cost no matter how hard the road is how difficult our life is if we'll identify with him here then he's going to identify with us there he's going to stand for you there hallelujah it's going to be worth it all Church on that day every trugg struggle you ever had every trial you ever face every hardship you think you went through when he says that I'm going to stand up for you in front of my father and all the Holy Angels and you hear your name called by our lord Jesus when the role is Called Up Yonder and you hear your name it's going to be worth everything you ever went through every trial every situation every sickness every battle it will be worth it all to hear him identify you as one of his own for they are worthy he says do you realize who's saying this it is Jesus the worthy one himself this is the only one who is accounted worthy to take the book out of him who sits upon the throne throne and now this worthy one is saying to his Saints you are worthy what did it say in Luke 21:36 watch ye therefore and pray always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man he says this pray always that you be accounted worthy and now here he is showing that someone's going to be accounted worthy some someone is going to escape oh but brother Aaron I'm So Unworthy me too the word says you're worthy but but brother Aaron I I'm I'm So Unworthy yes but because we were unworthy he sent the worthy one he came himself and took on flesh weep not weep not there is a worthy one it was the son of the Living God he was worthy to pay sin debt he was worthy to break the seals off the book he's worthy of your praise he's worthy enough to pay for your salvation he's the worthy one and because of that and because of our identification in him then our unworthiness has become worthiness because we've taken on his righteousness he is the worthy one Hallelujah and he says because of that you're going to walk with him in white think about that think think about that the purity of white not some spotted garment not something that identifies you with the sins that you committed here on Earth you're not going to wear something as you walk around they can look and oh he failed a lot oh he messed up a lot oh he had a lot of unbelief oh he backslid for years he went in and out in and out look at His Garment no sir we're going to be wearing the same garment as he's wearing identified just like him His Garment is pure and white your garment is pure and white not stained with sin but one that says washed clean pure worthy oh but I did so much no there you're wearing a white garment you are worthy Hallelujah the Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ the promise to the Overcomer in verse five he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white rment we see that reiterated again he wants you to know how you're going to look what you're going to be wearing that you're going to be clean and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and his holy angels we see once again the white robe and and then he says and I will not blot his name out of The Book of Life as we look at this we're going to see four different groups of names some that were there from before the foundation of the world in an eternal section of the book of life that can never be removed some are in the book of life but they're not part of the Bride they're granted life at the Judgment some names you'll see in the third group their names are removed from the book of life and finally some names that were never there never recorded on the book of life and as we dis dissect these groups it's important that we understand that God is omniscient God is all knowing he not only knows but he has always known there's not one that will be saved or lost that he doesn't already know so moving forward with that brother brandham says here when we get to this portion of the church age book referencing this topic of the book of life he says once again we come to a most difficult portion of the word so as we know that going in I want to approach it carefully so that we get a clear understanding of it he talks about how the calvinist and the Armenians will both use this scripture to to suit their own purposes as it relates to to predestination and to Salvation And he says some also say that this book of life now listen close is not the Lamb's Book of Life but as usual when one regards a verse superficially he comes up with a superficial understanding and there's so much in this that brother brandham took about 20 pages in the church age book to deal with it and then he comes around as he's preaching the invisible Union of the bride and he deals with the a great deal more to make sure there's still no confusion and in that sermon he I think it's right about the time where the church age book was coming available and so people didn't even have it in their hands yet but they were going to be receiving it at this meeting and so in that context he says this here it brings into view the two books that's going to be mysterious to you when you read the book of The Seven Church ages the two books book of life and one says you can put your name on it you can never come off other one says you take his name out of The Book of Life he's just saying there's going to be some stuff in here that's going to be confusing to you and he wants to clear it up he goes on to say in works as Faith Express when you get the book you're going to see maybe a little confusion there of what I said the two books of life it's the same book okay book but one of them is your natural birth and the other one is your spiritual birth he goes on to say the Baptist believe there's two separate books and in one way it is two separate books hold on now and in another way it isn't two separate books oh my but let's go back to this in the first quote it's the same book there's only one book of life but there is a section of that book that is an eternal section where names was written before the foundation of the world and they can never be removed never be removed it doesn't matter what the devil does how he comes against you how he attacks you what your struggle was today nothing will separate you nothing's going to separate you from the love of God there ain't no lie that's been following you there ain't no Str that's been following you no depression no anxiety no family trouble no up down in and out if your name was written on the last book of life before the foundation of the world in this section nothing can ever take it off you will be there and he will identify with you on that day in the rad call you will hear your name called but they are two books in the same way that the Bible has the Old and New Testament there are two different parts to this Bible but you would never say well well it's it's it's it's two different Bibles no it's the same book and the Book of uh this book is the same with different sections of the book see life is sacred to God and he records life in a book your life my life neighbor life people you saw at Walmart's life life he records life in a book but this natural life that we have here is a perversion of what God intended our life to be it's been perverted by the fall and this life this natural life is associated with sin and with death that's that's why we have to be born again that's why this life isn't good enough we have to be born again because our natural life is recorded in the book and our Deeds Done in the natural life and that's associated with sin and death the nature that came by our first birth first Birth has to die in order that we might be United with another nature brother Brown says your name of your first nature was born and put in a the book of life and all your Deeds was wrote in it to everything you done under that nature was put in a book called The Book of Life so all life is recorded in the book of life but not all names are written in the Eternal section of the Lamb's Book of Life not all names are written there brother Brandon we're go on to tell us there's not one scripture that tells us that God is current compiling names all of this was done according to God's for knowledge before the foundation of the world and it isn't as simple as well there's two groups and one group heard and didn't accept so their name isn't written and one group heard and did accept and so their name is written it's not that simple as a matter of fact well look here brother brandham says we will actually show by scripture that multitudes who are not even born again will go into eternal life as strange as this may sound it's certainly true my so we got names on the record that can never be removed names that will be removed names that were never recorded and people not born again going into eternal life we got some things to sort out here yes one more to drive this point home the book Book of Life to begin with there is no basis for the claims that the Lamb's Book of Life is not the same as the Book of Life you can see that though there are other books mentioned there is always the reference to one book containing names in the Revelation it is called the Lamb's Book of Life or The Book of Life Lamb's Book of Life or the book of life now we mentioned earlier that one of the groups is of people or names are names that are removed from the book and we're going to look at that for a little bit let's start here where the 70 have returned to Jesus Luke 10:18 and he said unto them I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you notwithstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven notice their names are written in heaven so as Jesus is is saying this he's speaking to the 70 what do we know about the 70 were they in the upper room were they good solid people that followed Jesus all the way to his crucifixion no this is right before they turn and leave him and say we don't want nothing to do do with you but he just said your names are written in heaven not only that if you read a couple verses down you'll realize that he's not just speaking to the 70 but he's also speaking to the 12 which means Judas is standing there and he tells Judas Rejoice because your name is written in heaven my Judas is standing there Judas is casting out devils in Jesus name Judas numbered with the 12 and according to John 13 Joseph was chosen by Jesus and before the day of Pentecost before the upper room he had a part in the ministry look at this the part that Judas obtained amongst the 12 and then loss was neither inferior to the ministries of the other 11 nor was it a devilish foreign Ministry interjected among the ministries of the others Judas a devil lost a god-given ho Holy Ghost Ministry and killed himself and went to his own place his name was even in the Book of Life we can't dispute that because the scripture just said it but his name was blotted out now let's find here in the Old Testament where God did the exact same thing we're going to look at this for a second just to set a precedent for this happening in First Kings 12 we find that reabo he he treated the people of Israel harshly when he became king and they rebelled against him and and jeroboam he he took the TW the 10 Northern tribes and he became king over them so the kingdom became divided you had you had 10 Northern tribes and two Southern tribes but Jerusalem was in the South with the two with King reabo and jeroboam was afraid that if the people went down to the temple in Jerusalem and they began to worship there then they would want to stay or that they would once again want to be part of raam's kingdom and it says here in First Kings 12 and 27 if this people this is jeroboam speaking go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord even to roboam King of Judah and they shall kill me and go again to roboam King of Judah so he doesn't want them to go worship where they're supposed to worship he doesn't want them going to the temple because he's afraid that they're going to get down there and want to stay there and rejoin with that so to keep them from going to Jerusalem to to worship jeroboam sets up two golden calves for the people to worship one is in the city of Dan in the inheritance of Dan and one one is in the city of bethl in the in the um in inheritance of Ephraim and it says here whereupon the king took counsel and made two calves of gold and said unto them it is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem Behold thy Gods o Israel which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt and he set one in in bethl and the other he put in Dan and this thing became a sin for the people for the people went to worship before the one even unto Dan now I want to stop right here and show you this in the scripture let's look back at the golden calf incident in the wilderness if you'll remember this ain't the first time that we've had golden calves made to worship so before we even get to their punishment and what God's going to do let's look back and see some foreshadowing and see what God's going to do for this worship and it came to pass on the tomorrow this is after they have worshiped the golden calf that Moses said unto the people you have sinned a great sin and now I will go up unto the Lord per Adventure I shall make an atonement for your sin and Moses returned unto the Lord and said oh this people have sinned a great sin and have made them gods of gold yet now if thou Wilt forgive their sin and if not blot me I pray out of thy book which thou Hast written and the Lord said unto Moses whosoever has sinned against me him will I blot out of my book what is it that God's telling them about idolatry if you turn to idolatry or you sin against me what's going to happen to your name in The Book of Life it's going to be removed blotted out we see it in Deuteronomy 29 16- 20 he says for ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt and how we came through the ations which you pass by and you have seen their Abominations and their idols and wood and stone silver and gold which were among them lest there should be among you man or woman or family or tribe whose heart turneth away this day from the Lord Our God to go and serve the gods of these nations lest there should be among you a root that beareth GA and wormwood skipping down to verse 20 the Lord will not spare him but the anger of the Lord and his jealousy shall smoke against that man and all the curses that are written in this book book shall lie upon him all the curses are going to lie upon Him idolatry is not something God plays with it'll get your name blotted out the tribe and the people who turn to idolatry we're going to have their names blotted out so now I'm going to come back to jeroboam back to our story it says just down to verse 30 and this thing became a sin for the people went to worship before the one even unto Dan now one was placed in Dan one was placed in bethl bethl is a part of of of the inheritance of Ephraim okay so here's what I'm showing youall this for if you'll skip ahead to the Book of Revelation Revelation chapter 7 when the list of the tribes of the 144 that that the 144,000 are going to come out of Dan and Ephraim are missing you will not find them in the Book of Revelation because they turn to idolatry and so you look over here names tribes people that were that were there part of God's chosen people but they turned aside and you get over into the Book of Revelation and their names are missing because of idolatry God wipes those two tribes plac from under Heaven they're not even listed in the book of Revelation Hosea 4:17 says Ephraim is joined to Idols let him alone prophet of God says that is exactly as it is for now Israel is back in Palestine and soon the Lord will seal 144,000 of them but from that number Dan and Ephraim are missing he says that great God who is bringing Israel back to Palestine knows exactly which tribe every true Israelite is from and from all the assembled 144,000 Dan and Ephraim will be missing blotted out they had a part they were called they were chosen people Judas was a chosen disciple listen the children of Israel they they left Egypt called out by Prophet following the pillar of fire all of them under the blood of the sacrificial lamb all of them went through the waters of the Red Sea all of them enjoyed the Miracles but then they came to Moab and joined in the Feast of bpor and there they died what happened they came out but they didn't go all the way they came out but they stopped short they came out but somewhere along the way they got caught up and we're the chosen people we've got a prophet we're following the pillar of far and that's enough and so they didn't never cross over and because they stopped short their names are blotted out of the Lamb's Book of Life he says there are people this quote struck me so hard as I was studying who seem involved in the things of God Almost 100% I don't know how it's to interpret this he says they are like Judas the line I focused on is almost 100% and maybe my interpretation is harsh but what I'm seeing is if you're 99% you're like Judas I am 99% sold out they are like Judas I've given God almost everything they are like Judas I've come out and I've battled I've been through so much I just I just I just can't take that last step they are like Judas Almost 100% even in like Tabernacle we can't be an almost almost church we can't have almost lives with almost almost homes with almost born again we got to be sold out all the way filled with the spirit dedicated we can't stop short we're not like Judas we're not like Judas but we're going to the upper room and we're going to repent and be baptized and filled with the spirit we're pushing all the way to a rapture we can't be tainted with the things of the world with our own ideas and our own beliefs we can't be almost we got to be all the way dedicated and not just reformed that's why this age God found no pleasure in it they were just reformed he didn't want reformed he wanted restored don't just reform your life to where we just end up you know being a a bunch of message Amish with a set of rules you got to dress like this you got to do this we do this and it comes a lifestyle and people are happy in their lifestyle hey I think it's a good lifestyle but that ain't what it's about it's not just a lifestyle but it's a life reproducing The Life of Christ here on Earth filled with the spirit we can't just be reformed but we got to be restored to the image that he had of us before the foundation of the world restored to the Spotless sinless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ that's so much more than a Reformation that is a restoration restored back to who you really are not keeping some of who you want to be and mixing in some truths that's Reformation we got to go all the way to the New Birth notice these people whose names and these tribes whose names are removed are religious people these ain't scum of the earth as you might would say or whatever these are religious people church people might I say it called people people who were part of the movement people who worship God brother Brown says like Judas they didn't go all the way see Judas was chosen of God he was instructed in truth he shared knowledge of the Mysteries that's one thing people like to say you know well it's not all that important about the moving of the spirit and the healings and the Miracles Judas had that too well Judas also understood the Mysteries he had a Ministry of power granted unto him and he healed the sick and cast out devils in jesus' name but when The Showdown came he sold out for gold and political power he did not go up to Pentecost to receive the spirit of God he was devoid of the spirit make no mistake about it a person that has truly baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way that is the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost Judas failed multitudes faed right there and when they fail to go on in that word their names are taken off the book of life I'm not going to fit this pattern I'm not going to be one that comes most of the way but then stops I'm going to go all the way with the word I'm going to go on with God I'm going to cross over look the waters may be raging but I know I can strike the river and I can say where is the god of Elijah and I know I can cross over listen I don't care what you're facing today I don't care off far you've come tonight do not stop where you are but press on press on to more victories press on even into the battle don't forget there's an angel that goes before you to scatter your enemies and to win the battle for you press on tonight into more go on with God go on in the word go on in the spirit whatever you do don't stop but press in listen more than ever before we got to be preaching the new birth more than ever before we got to get people to the upper room that's where Judas failed he wouldn't go to the upper room he couldn't go to the upper room you must be born again evening light Tabernacle and I say tonight I don't care how long you've been wandering around in the wilderness how long you've been Justified how long you've been Sanctified how long you've been failing around the same Mountain I say tonight is a night you can cross over tonight is a night you can step into the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can accept the new birth you can experience the new birth you can have your life changed forever you don't have to go around the mountain one more time but you can go forward and possess the land and possess the promise that belongs to you don't rest in being called Don't rest that you have come out but you must press in Hallelujah names taken off the book we've covered names taken off the book and I'm trying to hurry but I want to look at those now that are granted life we're going read in Matthew 25 it says when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the Holy Angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a Shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats now brother Brandon makes it clear here these aren't sheep and goats he said it's as he said the Sheep are already with him in the throne the true sheep the Bride of Jesus is not standing at the white Throne judgment being judged so he says this is as these aren't there aren't sheep he says and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left then shall the king say unto them on his right hand Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for I was hunger and you gave me meat I was thirsty and you gave me drink I was a stranger and you took me in naked and you clothed me I was sick and you visited me I was in prison and you came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when saw we thee a hunger and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee and the King sh shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto you in as much as you have done it unto the least of these my little ones my brethren you have done it unto me then shall he say also unto them on the left hand depart from me you curse into Everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels for I was a hungered and you gave me no meat I was thirsty and you gave me no drink I was a stranger and you took me not in naked and you clothed me not sick and in prison and you visited me not then shall they also answer saying Lord when saw we thee a hunger or a thirst or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not Minister unto thee then shall he answer them saying verily I say unto you and as much as you did it not to one of the least of these you did it not to me and these shall go away into Everlasting punishment but the righteous into eternal life what you're seeing here is the great white Throne judgment we see God passing judgment here based on works just like it says in Revelation 20 Revelation 20 he said and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works we see both righteous and unrighteous at this judgment but like I said this group of righteous is not the bride this is this is not the bride the bride doesn't stand before the Judgment Throne the bride is sitting with him in the throne 1 Corinthians 6 says do you not know that the Saints shall judge judge the world Revelation 3:21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my Throne so these righteous are not the bride he says the question now arises why are these righteous ones in judgment he said there's no other place that they can come up he says for there are but two resurrections and since they could not qualify for the first resurrection they must come up in the second which is a resurrection unto judgment why why didn't they qualify for the first resurrection they weren't born again they didn't have the token they didn't have o you know you know the parable they're the five foolish virgins they don't have any o they didn't have the Holy Ghost they weren't bride and so they couldn't come up in the first resurrection therefore they had to come up into judgment they come up not having eternal life but they receive eternal life and how is it they are receiving life on how they treated the bride they're receiving life on that that that they helped you and they cared for you and they were kind to you brother Brown says they are not his Brethren talking about Jesus they're not his Brethren he says that would make them join HS with Jesus they're not heirs to anything but life they share No throne with him their names must have been in the Book of Life and not removed now because of their love of the people of God they are recognized and saved no doubt these served and helped the children of God perhaps like Nicodemus and Gia they stood for the children in a time of trouble he said the names of many of these many of those destroyed were in The Book of Life also but they were blotted out because they failed to honor the people of God who were the Living manifested Word living Epistles for their day listen I don't mean to make this a Sunday school lesson but it matters how we treat people if there's literally people getting in heaven and people's names being blotted out of heaven based off how they treated people and don't think you're going to be excused for how you treat people just because you go to church with them this ain't just an out there problem God cares how we treat one another it matters to him I've said it a bunch of times here and I'll say it again we're not all going to be best friends not everybody's coming to everybody's birthday party that just ain't how life works it's not possible but you should treat everyone with the same kindness and love and respect do a child of God you know how you feel when someone mistreats your child even if it's another one of your children that does it doesn't matter as one of your children it makes you just as angry that's how God feels but way way way way worse because he died for that child it matters how we treat people he cares how we treat one another these are granted life it is this second resurrection that the foolish virgin comes up they do not have the Holy Ghost so they miss being in the bride but they are a separated people they're are a god-loving people they're trying to abide by his word to the best they know and they are a help to the work of the Lord all of these people had their names in The Book of Life and their names remained listen I say we serve a God full of grace and a God full of Mercy not even born again they're not his Brethren but he grants to them eternal life listen I'll say it again it's not a bad deal well they don't get to come into the city no that's what you get but they get to avoid hell and they get eternal life in heaven that's a God full of grace a God full of Mercy he says they will come up in the second resurrection and go into eternal life so there are those whose names were written and taken off there are those whose names were written and their names remained as they were granted life and then and I'm not going to spend much time on this one there are those whose names were never written at all names that have never been or ever will be written on the books Revelation 178 says the Beast that thou sawest was now remember when were names written on the book of life before the foundation of the world and shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into predition and they that dwell on the Earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world when they beheld the Beast that was and is not and yet is brother brandham says these were ordained of God but not unto election and with this group is such that are as Pharaoh because it says of him even for this same purpose have I raised thee up vessels of Wrath fitted for Destruction it says him even for the same purpose have I raised thee up vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction Romans 9:17 and22 none of these would be placed on the records of life I'm not saying that there's no record of them this is Brother Brown no doubt there's some kind of record of them but not in the records of life now remember what we said at the beginning God is omniscient and he knows all and his ways are above our ways if he's omnicient then and he's perfect in his wisdom and he's perfect in his righteousness it it it's hard to understand this but brother Bram tells us since the portion of the word is hard for the human mind to grasp it must be accepted and believed by faith therefore as Paul says if God should take one lump of clay and make of that same lump one vessel under honor and another vessel under dishonor who can be offended and cry against him and if there are those who names were never placed on a record of life we must accept that also and if there are those who will enter into life eternal after the white Throne judgment solely on the grounds of being good and kind or just to the elect of God who are his Brethren then we cannot but accept that for who knoweth the mind of the Lord that he should instruct him and we get to the close of this chapter and brother brandham begins to use the analogy of the wheat plant he about how the seed goes down into the ground so that a single grain will reproduce itself over a period of time into much more than a single grain but into a multitude that seed dies but the life that was in it will come up in the plant and that plant no now pay close attention is not the reproduction of the grain but it is the carrier of the life of that grain which at some point is going to come back to the the original form but in a multiplied form so now we're we're we're starting to get to the last group to the group whose names were always on the book and can never be taken off the names in the Eternal section of the book so Christ The Royal SE died so that his very life would be produced in other bodies but as it comes up the blade isn't the wheat the tosel isn't the wheat it was a carrier of the life but it is not the wheat John even says of the wheat what's he say he says in Matthew 3:12 he says whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly Purge his floor and gather his wheat into the Garner that's the Rapture the wheat is gathered but he will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire the chaff was part of the plant the chaff protected the seed the chaff was part of the church but it never was wheat it was only a carrier of the life he's going to take the wheat the grain the ones that that have his same life those are bone of his bone he's going to take them into the Garner that's Harvest Time that's where we're at it's going home time who who who are these people these are ones whose name were always on the book they always was wheat they always was a part of him they were elected to eternal life and they're gathered together but the chaff is burned what's that mean in terms of tonight's sermon blotted out stages of the week and we're bringing this down you have the blade the stalk the husk the tassel the chaff these are the stages of the church brother brandham calls the stages of the wheat plant the record of the book of life as the church comes forth Through the Ages he says Jesus Christ died and gave his life that life was to come back upon the church and bring many sons like him to himself unto glory in the resurrection but as the wheat seed had to have a carrier to bring forth multiplied wheat seed even so there had to be a church which would be a carrier of the Life of Christ so think about it just part of that plant just part of it can go back to being the seed because just part of that wheat plant is eternal life wheat only a part of it and the church has been carrying the life down Through the Ages and all the church and although the church was not the Original Seed the life of that seed was being carried through he uses Israel as an example Israel came out two million strong and yet they were never going to possess the land they were literally carriers of the life what do I mean by that it was their children who was going to possess the land they were carrying the life of the ones that would cross over they were just carriers the ones that came after them were going to possess the promised land what happened to them we're back to it they stopped short they didn't go they didn't take the land because God didn't let them they didn't take the land because they chose to rebel against God they said let's make captains and go back we can't take the land I'm telling you there's a people here that can take the land there's a people who aren't just carriers of the life but they are a reproduction of that life on the earth once again and they're here to take the land most of them had their names blotted out and the same in the church world today names are being blotted out but there is an eternal section there are those whose names have been there before the foundation of the world and they shall always remain and those are the names of those that were in him they are part of him they were in his thinking they are his attributes and not one shall I say it and not one of our names is going to be blotted out of the Eternal section of the Lamb's Book of Life we're not carriers We Are The Original Seed we are what went into the ground it's up again it's harvest time and the life of Christ is now upon the Earth again in a multi- membered body the original life chosen in him before the world began she is in him she is in his throne and she can never be judged oh Hallelujah I'm thankful I'm not going to stand before that judgment I'm thankful that I'm letting the word of God judge me now and I'm saying Lord mold me now Lord change me now Lord make sure that on that day I'm sitting with you in your throne and not standing in front of your throne that I will be accounted worthy to walk in white a robe that's washed white by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ the worthy one and he's going to look at us and say you're worthy you're worthy you're worthy your name was always there and I'm going to stand now you identified yourself with me on Earth and now I'm going to identify myself with you in front of my father and all the Holy Angels come forth into eternal life your name was always on the Book of Life We Can't Stop short evening like Tabernacle but we will reproduce the fullness of the life of the Original Seed in a multi-member bride body and reproduce Christ upon the Earth and when the role is Called Up Yonder out of that Eternal section where no name can be struck off we're going to hear our name called father they stood for me father when all hell was against them they wouldn't back down they confessed my name and now I'm going to confess
