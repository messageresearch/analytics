[42:22] the Lord. Oh, praise the Lord.
[42:27] Praise the Lord,
[42:31] oh my
[42:44] with my soul.
[42:50] It is well.
[42:54] It is well.
[42:57] with my soul. Let's
[43:00] &gt;&gt; sing that last verse again. My sin will
[43:02] bless.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Oh my
[43:12] glorious
[43:15] heart.
[43:18] My sour

[43:55] Oh
[43:57] well.
[43:59] Hallelujah.
[44:02] Thank you Jesus.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[44:08] Oh
[44:10] well.
[44:13] is well
[44:15] with my soul.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord,
[44:25] hast the day
[44:28] when my
[44:29] &gt;&gt; when my face shall be shine
[44:36] and the clouds
[44:38] will roll back.
[44:46] for the trump.
[45:08] Sing that last verse.
[45:14] But Lord,
[45:16] cheers for thee.
[45:20] For thy coming
[45:24] we wait.
[45:27] The sky
[45:32] is our
[45:34] gold
[45:40] sh
[45:42] Have you heard the shout? Have you heard
[45:45] the voice of the Lord?
[45:51] Blessing.
[45:55] Blessing.
[45:59] of my soul.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, it is well. Let's stand together
[46:03] this morning. It is well
[46:11] with my soul.
[46:17] Oh, it is well.
[46:21] It is well
[46:24] with my soul is well.
[46:30] Oh, it is well.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; It is well.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, with my soul.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; with my soul.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; It is well.
[46:48] It is well.
[46:51] with my soul.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:57] Amen. Ain't it great? You can start out
[47:00] this new year
[47:02] &gt;&gt; saying it is well.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; All is well.
[47:07] Amen. We have seeing things where our
[47:10] faith has become in sight.
[47:13] Miracles are happening among us.
[47:15] Deliverance is taking place.
[47:18] prodals returning home.
[47:21] The children of God rejoicing.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Healing's taking place.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; God is still God. And he's here to make
[47:31] real his word to you today. And in this
[47:34] new year to come, he's here to manifest
[47:37] himself in a greater way because we're
[47:40] truly in the end time. We're here in the
[47:43] fulfillment of prophecy where the word
[47:46] of God is being made manifest in this
[47:49] hour, in this time.
[47:51] If you got a need today, why don't you
[47:53] lift a hand to God and say, "Lord, don't
[47:56] pass me by. Come speak to me." Lord
[48:00] Jesus, as we bow before thy throne of
[48:03] grace, we want to thank you for love,
[48:06] mercy, and grace,
[48:09] which is what we see when we look upon
[48:11] you.
[48:12] Not an avenging judge, not an angry God,
[48:16] but a compassionate, loving Savior whose
[48:20] arms are stretched out, whose mercy, oh
[48:24] God, we cannot fathom, whose grace is
[48:27] unsearchable.
[48:29] Oh God, today we ask that you'll speak
[48:32] to our hearts. Reveal yourself, Lord,
[48:36] through the word. May, oh God, I be a
[48:39] vehicle today through which your voice
[48:41] can be heard as you would say, Lord,
[48:44] through the messenger of this age that
[48:47] the voice of God would be in the
[48:49] ministry. and Lord, ministers, men of
[48:53] God that are sent of God. For you didn't
[48:57] choose the wind, the waves, the the
[49:00] stars, the sun, the moon to preach the
[49:02] gospel, but you chose men. So Lord, let
[49:06] us be heralds of the great truth today.
[49:09] And may your word, Lord, just go forth
[49:12] in power. May it break the the bonds,
[49:16] the bounds of of man. And Lord, the
[49:19] hindrances that would be there, the
[49:21] chains would drop off. Unbelief leave,
[49:25] Lord. Oh God, that the evil spirits that
[49:28] have had people bound, oh God, that they
[49:31] can rise up knowing I'm delivered, I
[49:35] pray, dear God, that you'll bless your
[49:37] people today, Lord, the hands that was
[49:40] lifted to you, Lord, signifying the
[49:42] need, I ask that you'll minister to that
[49:45] soul today if necessary to even call us
[49:48] out, Lord, of our of the subject we're
[49:52] speaking on and cause us to step out,
[49:55] Lord, in under the inspiration and
[49:57] discern the heart and speak directly to
[49:59] the need. Father, we commit ourselves to
[50:02] you. Now, Lord, I pray that this today
[50:06] won't be mechanical, but it'll be the
[50:09] inspiration of the Holy Spirit and that
[50:12] you'll give ears to hear, Lord, in this
[50:15] congregation and those around the world.
[50:18] Lord, that you'll lift our spirits, oh
[50:20] God, and our faith now to believe the
[50:22] word of promise. For the promise is unto
[50:25] us, to our children, to them that are
[50:28] far off, an apostolic age that has never
[50:31] ceased. And we are in it at this time,
[50:34] in this moment, with the same God, the
[50:36] same manifestations, the same glory. We
[50:39] ask it in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God
[50:43] bless you. If you'll turn with me to
[50:45] Genesis chapter 1, we'll read from verse
[50:48] one. Genesis chapter 1 and verse one.
[50:54] In the beginning, God created the heaven
[50:58] and the earth.
[51:00] And the earth was without form and void,
[51:03] and darkness was upon the face of the
[51:06] deep. And the spirit of God moved upon
[51:10] the face of the waters. And God said,
[51:13] "Let there be light." And there was
[51:17] light. Amen. God bless you. You can be
[51:20] seated.
[51:22] I think it's very appropriate that we
[51:24] start here in the very first chapter in
[51:28] the first verse of the Bible here at our
[51:30] first service
[51:32] this this new year's as we just look in
[51:36] a time of reflecting about the beginning
[51:39] there and also the beginnings of a new
[51:41] year
[51:43] and you know today I I want to speak on
[51:46] a subject um that I've never spoke on
[51:50] before but something that I want to
[51:53] impart upon you today and we see how the
[51:56] Holy Spirit will direct it but I want to
[51:59] speak on bringing order out of chaos.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; It was in the quiet hours of the early
[52:05] morning sometimes last week probably
[52:09] about Monday or Tuesday that I I was I
[52:12] was suddenly awakened.
[52:14] I was caught between two worlds. My my
[52:17] body lay still in the natural, resting
[52:20] on the bed, but my spirit was aware of
[52:24] another realm.
[52:26] And in that place of awakening
[52:29] there, I I heard with clarity these
[52:32] words spoken very plainly, bringing
[52:35] order out of chaos.
[52:38] And I was immediately aware that this
[52:40] phrase had been used before. I know
[52:42] brother Biscll preached a message with
[52:43] that title, though I've never heard the
[52:46] sermon myself. Honestly, I don't know
[52:48] what he preached in that service or how
[52:51] that he was directed to minister that.
[52:54] Yet, what God impressed upon me was not
[52:58] a borrowed thought, but a living truth.
[53:00] It was one that had already proven
[53:03] itself by the power of God. Uh because I
[53:07] was reminded of the testimony of brother
[53:10] Ron Spencer that he shared when when I
[53:13] he heard brother Bisco preach this using
[53:17] this title in North Carolina.
[53:20] And um at that time he was recovering
[53:22] from a devastating fire. As you know
[53:25] this has been about 17 18 years ago now.
[53:29] His lungs had been badly scarred by the
[53:33] smoke and the heat. His his breathing
[53:35] was was very limited. His strength was
[53:39] diminished and and his ministry was
[53:42] severely affected. His body was in chaos
[53:47] &gt;&gt; and and um his future really even at
[53:50] that moment as a minister it looked
[53:53] uncertain because you have to have
[53:55] breath to be able to preach. And you
[53:59] know, he was still trying to minister
[54:00] and labor under that because as the
[54:03] Bible said, the spirit indeed is
[54:04] willing, but the flesh is weak.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; And at that service, while listening to
[54:10] brother Biscll preach that message of
[54:12] bringing order out of chaos, there was
[54:15] faith that rose in his heart. And as the
[54:20] word was preached, he stood to his feet.
[54:23] He lifted his hands toward heaven. And
[54:26] by faith, he just breathed in healing
[54:29] from the spirit of God. And at that
[54:31] moment, the the almighty God met him and
[54:35] his lungs were restored and his strength
[54:37] was returned. And what the doctors could
[54:40] not repair, the Holy Ghost did it
[54:42] instantly.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; You see, God literally brought order out
[54:47] of chaos.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; And as you know, uh, Brother Ron has
[54:52] been in this journey with cancer. And I
[54:55] think now this will be entered into his
[54:58] sixth year where that you know that he
[55:01] has had to deal now with um cancer being
[55:05] having fourth stage lung cancer then
[55:08] went to his brain and and other parts of
[55:11] the body. And uh throughout this journey
[55:14] I've seen God do this again and again.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. take moments where it was chaos
[55:21] &gt;&gt; and turn it into divine order.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; And it was like that morning that I was
[55:27] at brother Ron's home when I was
[55:29] awakened and I was hearing this song
[55:32] that was sung from a heavenly dimension.
[55:35] We shall see miracles.
[55:38] And when God does miracles, it's always
[55:40] God stepping into chaos
[55:43] &gt;&gt; and bringing order. Amen.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; And I I saw it happen, you know, again
[55:47] when he was late dying and the doctors
[55:50] was about to harvest his order his
[55:53] organs after being burned in a fire. And
[55:56] I saw it again when brother Donnie and I
[55:58] prayed with him about the first news of
[56:01] cancer. And that's where I was that
[56:03] morning when I heard it from the other
[56:05] dimension. We shall see miracles. And we
[56:08] have certainly seen miracles.
[56:10] And I I saw there in that moment though
[56:13] that the chaos of fear left him and
[56:16] order was restored.
[56:18] I I saw this happen again when he was
[56:21] diagnosed with cancer in his eyes and
[56:23] they were about to take out one of his
[56:25] eyes and treat the other with chemo in
[56:28] hopes to save his life. I stood there,
[56:32] brother Donnie and I met him there again
[56:34] and and uh we both ministered there. I I
[56:37] preached there a sermon called the hour
[56:39] has come because we were at a very
[56:41] critical crucial hour.
[56:44] And you know those those hours come you
[56:46] know it may be your hour
[56:49] &gt;&gt; your day your visitation even this
[56:52] morning
[56:53] &gt;&gt; where that God will step in to your
[56:56] chaos
[56:58] &gt;&gt; and bring order in your life. But in
[57:01] that crucial hour where that chaos had
[57:04] come, where he was about to lose an eye,
[57:07] that that God stepped into that chaos
[57:10] and and the cancer was gone. The eye was
[57:14] clear. And and I'll tell you, these
[57:16] things were not emotional excitement. It
[57:19] was not even the power of suggestion. It
[57:23] was the power of faith that was
[57:25] responding to the spoken word. I want
[57:28] you to know the word has power
[57:30] &gt;&gt; and the word still works.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; And the scripture said that faith comes
[57:35] by hearing and hearing the word of God
[57:39] preached.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And again, he sent his word and
[57:43] healed them. That's Psalms 107:20.
[57:47] And so, YOU KNOW, MIRACLES DON'T COME
[57:49] FROM HUMAN EFFORTS. It comes from
[57:52] believing the promise of God.
[57:54] And this was a a living DEMONSTRATION
[57:57] THAT WHEN GOD SPEAKS INTO DISORDER,
[58:01] whether in creation or in a body or into
[58:04] a life, I don't care what kind of chaos
[58:08] it is.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Chaos must yield.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; For with God, nothing shall be
[58:14] impossible.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; AND I I WANT YOU TO LOOK TODAY AT
[58:18] WHATEVER you are facing or whatever
[58:20] situation that you are in. Maybe the
[58:24] chaos that is in your life or in your
[58:26] family or in your finances or in your
[58:29] situations, whatever it would be, I want
[58:32] you to look at it and and look at it
[58:35] with with this kind of faith. With God,
[58:38] nothing shall be impossible.
[58:43] And what I realized the other day in
[58:45] that early moment movement was this,
[58:48] that the same God who hovered over the
[58:51] dark waters in Genesis and spoke light
[58:54] into existence is the one who is still
[58:57] speaking today.
[58:59] And as I lay there upon the bed, as this
[59:02] AS THIS THOUGHT CAME TO ME, the
[59:04] scriptures began to just kind of unfold
[59:07] to me and and I got up quickly and begin
[59:09] to write them down. And today I want to
[59:13] convey to you the things that God has
[59:16] has laid upon my heart.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because now it won't be laid just
[59:22] upon my heart. For it is not for me
[59:24] alone, but is for you. is going to be
[59:27] laid there upon you for you to decide
[59:30] what you want done with the chaos in
[59:33] your life.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; And this this is of course as we look
[59:38] AND WE WENT BACK TO THE BOOK OF GENESIS,
[59:42] I want to even go beyond the beginning
[59:44] and I want to say before time, before
[59:46] space, BEFORE SOUND ITSELF, GOD dwelt
[59:50] alone.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; He is the I am God. He's not just an I
[59:56] was or I will be, but a present tense
[59:59] God.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; AND ALTHOUGH HE IS I was because he was
[1:00:03] in our past.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; And though he will be because he is in
[1:00:08] our future,
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; but he is he wants you to know that he
[1:00:12] IS THE I AM GOD THAT IS PRESENT
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; THAT IS READY TO BRING order into your
[1:00:18] life.
[1:00:20] And and so you SEE WHEN WHEN GOD DWELT
[1:00:24] ALONE AND THERE WAS NO UNIVERSE HUMMING
[1:00:27] AND THERE WAS NO ANGELS SINGING AND
[1:00:30] THERE WAS NO STARS BURNING only
[1:00:32] stillness, absolute silence. God was
[1:00:37] there. He existed in the fullness of his
[1:00:41] eternal being. HE WAS COMPLETE AND
[1:00:44] SELF-SUFFICIENT. YET HE WAS alone in his
[1:00:47] own thoughts. AND THOSE THOUGHTS WERE
[1:00:49] NOT IDLE THOUGHTS,
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; BUT THEY WERE HIS ATTRIBUTES.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; THOSE THOUGHTS WERE ALIVE. THEY WERE
[1:00:57] POWERFUL.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEY WERE POTENTIALLY THE WORD
[1:01:00] THAT HAD NOT YET BEEN FORMED.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE POTENTIALLY SONS OF GOD WHO
[1:01:05] HAD NOT YET BEEN MADE MANIFEST. BUT in
[1:01:08] him, his thoughts were eternal. and they
[1:01:11] were alive and they were POWERFUL AND
[1:01:14] THEY WERE MOVING in his thoughts as he
[1:01:17] would even see you here in time as the
[1:01:20] SONS OF GOD SHOUTING together for joy
[1:01:24] over the victory you have in Christ.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; SO BEFORE THE BEGINNING you see he was
[1:01:31] and before the beginning you existed in
[1:01:34] his mind.
[1:01:36] Really church, YOU ARE NOT A TEMPORAL
[1:01:38] BEING. You have always been.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE YOU EXISTED FIRST OF ALL
[1:01:44] IN HIS THINKING IN HIS ETERNAL PLAN. SO
[1:01:48] THEREFORE, THERE IS AN ETERNAL QUALITY
[1:01:51] TO GOD'S ELECT TODAY.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN. You see, YOU YOU WERE NO AT NOT AT
[1:01:57] THAT TIME A TANGIBLE BEING, BUT YOU WERE
[1:02:00] REAL BECAUSE GOD'S THOUGHTS ARE REAL.
[1:02:03] YOU WERE ETERNAL BECAUSE GOD'S THOUGHTS
[1:02:06] ARE ETERNAL. BUT GOD WANTED YOU MORE
[1:02:08] THAN AN attribute in himself. HE WANTED
[1:02:12] YOU EXPRESSED into a form that he could
[1:02:17] love, THAT HE COULD TOUCH. AMEN. THAT HE
[1:02:20] could that he could manifest himself to.
[1:02:23] So God chose not to remain alone
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; and he'll never be alone again. Amen.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; For God is love and love desires
[1:02:38] expression.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; AND LIFE LONGS TO reproduce itself.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; AND SO CREATION BEGAN. IT DIDN'T BEGIN
[1:02:47] WITH CHAOS, BUT IT BEGAN WITH GOD
[1:02:50] REVEALING HIMSELF.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; AND THE STILLNESS WAS BROKEN WHEN GOD
[1:02:55] FORMED HIMSELF INTO A LIGHT, A LITTLE
[1:02:58] HALO of light, a pillar of fire. For God
[1:03:01] said, "Let there be light."
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; And now the thoughts that were in God
[1:03:07] became released into another form. As it
[1:03:11] began to move into theophonyic form and
[1:03:14] from theophonyic form, it would become
[1:03:16] manifested in flesh.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; So creation began with God speaking.
[1:03:24] AND THIS AND THEN BECAUSE OF HIM
[1:03:27] SPEAKING IT BROUGHT ILLUMINATION
[1:03:30] AND THAT WAS MORE THAN A PHYSICAL
[1:03:32] ILLUMINATION. IT WAS FIRST THE OUTWARD
[1:03:35] IT WAS THE FIRST OUTWARD EXPRESSION OF
[1:03:38] ETERNAL GOD as John tells us in him was
[1:03:42] life
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; AND THAT LIFE WAS THE LIGHT OF MEN
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; AND GOD STEPPED OUT OF SILENCE AND into
[1:03:51] revelation. Amen.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; This was the beginning. This was the
[1:03:55] logos. For in the beginning was the word
[1:04:00] and the word was with God and the word
[1:04:03] was God. And when the word came forth
[1:04:06] from God, it be to CREATE BECAUSE THE
[1:04:09] WORD IS LIFE AND LIFE BEGINS.
[1:04:13] SO YOU SEE IT COULD NOT IT COULD NOT
[1:04:15] JUST PRODUCE ITSELF WITHOUT CREATION
[1:04:19] BECAUSE IT IS LIFE AND LIFE PRODUCES ITS
[1:04:22] OWN SELF
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; kind after kind and creation would be
[1:04:27] you know how it began with God speaking
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. THE FIRST THING OF CREATION was
[1:04:35] the voice of God. God speaking out and
[1:04:39] the universe as it was born. It was not
[1:04:42] born quietly. No. No. Psalms 33:6 says,
[1:04:47] "By the word of the Lord were the
[1:04:49] heavens made and THE HOST OF THEM BY THE
[1:04:52] BREATH of his mouth.
[1:04:54] AND ANGELS WERE CREATED THEN TO INHABIT
[1:04:57] THAT NEWLY SPOKEN REALM. AND THEY BURST
[1:05:01] FORTH NOW IN SPONTANEOUS WORSHIP.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; OH YEAH. JOB TELLS US WHEN THE WHEN THE
[1:05:07] MORNING STARS SANG TOGETHER AND ALL THE
[1:05:10] SONS OF GOD SHOUTED FOR joy and heaven
[1:05:14] was no longer silent.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; It began to pulse with praise. It began
[1:05:20] to echo the glory of the ONE WHO HAD
[1:05:22] SPOKEN IT INTO EXISTENCE.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; AND GOD WOULD NO LONGER BE THE LONELY
[1:05:27] GOD DWELLING IN SILENCE ALONE. AND BY
[1:05:30] HIMSELF. AND AS HE SPOKE, HE MOVED IN A
[1:05:32] MANIFESTATION,
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; the logos, the word. For John 1:1 says,
[1:05:39] in the beginning, here's the beginning.
[1:05:41] Now, in the beginning was the word and
[1:05:45] the word was with God and the word was
[1:05:48] God. You see, the word was God's eternal
[1:05:53] order, made visible, audible, active.
[1:05:58] Now heaven is alive AND AND IT'S FILLED
[1:06:02] WITH LIGHT. IT'S FILLED WITH SOUND. IT
[1:06:04] IT'S FILLED WITH WORSHIP.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; AND EVEN THE VAST HEAVENS THEMSELVES
[1:06:10] REFLECT HIS GLORY. THE STAR IS IGNITED
[1:06:14] AND ROLLED INTO PLACE AT HIS VERY
[1:06:17] COMMAND. Psalms 147:4 says, "He tellth
[1:06:21] the number of the stars. HE CALLETH THEM
[1:06:24] ALL BY their names." AND THE PROPHET
[1:06:27] SAYS IN IN IN PSALMS 19:1, "THE THE
[1:06:31] HEAVENS DECLARE the glory of God. The
[1:06:34] firminant sha showeth his handiwork. Day
[1:06:37] unto day utter speech, and night unto
[1:06:40] night showeth knowledge."
[1:06:43] So the heavens declare his knowledge.
[1:06:46] THEY UTTER SPEECH. YOU SEE, CREATION IS
[1:06:50] NOT MUTE. It's expressive.
[1:06:53] AND MODERN SCIENCE EVEN TODAY WILL
[1:06:56] CONFIRM THAT WHAT THE SCRIPTURE DECLARED
[1:06:58] ALL ALONG THAT THE UNIVERSE IS FILLED
[1:07:01] WITH VIBRATION WITH FREQUENCY WITH SOUND
[1:07:05] AND THE STARS THEMSELVES WILL
[1:07:08] CONTINUOUSLY EMIT WAVES SILENT MAYBE to
[1:07:12] our ears here on the earth BUT YET
[1:07:14] DECLARING PRAISE to their creator. Amen.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Yet angels and galaxies,
[1:07:21] THEY THEY WERE NOT GOD'S ULTIMATE
[1:07:23] DESIRE.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; IN ALL THAT HE'D DONE, HE WASN'T
[1:07:27] FINISHED.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; You see, WORSHIP WAS ALONE WAS NOT
[1:07:31] ENOUGH. He had angels worshiping him.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; He had the universe WORSHIP HIM. THE
[1:07:37] STARS WERE UTTERING SOUNDS. THEY WERE
[1:07:40] ALL BRINGING PRAISE TO THE TO THE GLORY
[1:07:42] OF THE ONE WHO HAD CREATED HIM. BUT GOD
[1:07:45] WANTED MORE THAN WORSHIP. God wanted a
[1:07:48] family.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; YES, GOD WANTED YOU.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE VERY
[1:07:56] SUBSTANCE OF THE GOSPEL, WHEN HE SAYS,
[1:07:59] "GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD." COULD WE BRING
[1:08:01] IT PERSONAL to you? God so loved you,
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; he gave.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; He gave. Yes.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Here was God's expression.
[1:08:16] This eternal purpose that had been hid
[1:08:20] in the depths of his being, A PLACE
[1:08:22] WHERE BROTHER BRANDON WOULD CALL THE
[1:08:24] BACK PART OF HIS MIND.
[1:08:27] AND PAUL WRITES THAT HE THAT GOD CHOSE
[1:08:30] US IN HIM BEFORE THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE
[1:08:34] WORLD.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I WANT YOU TO KNOW YOU WAS NOT YOU
[1:08:38] WAS NOT THOUGHT OF AS SOMETHING APART
[1:08:40] from him but chosen in him.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND ANGELS WE KNOW THEY COULD
[1:08:48] WORSHIP HIM but they could not be born
[1:08:50] of him.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; STARS COULD DECLARE HIS GLORY BUT THEY
[1:08:54] COULD NOT LOVE HIM AS SONS AND
[1:08:56] DAUGHTERS.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; So God formed man and he was NOT JUST A
[1:09:01] FORMATION IN his thoughts now but he
[1:09:03] breathed. The Bible said in Genesis 2:7,
[1:09:06] "AND THE LORD GOD FORMED man out of the
[1:09:10] dust of the earth and breathed
[1:09:13] into his nostrils the breath of life and
[1:09:16] man became a living soul."
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; God placed his own life inside of
[1:09:23] humanity. Yes.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Sons and daughters of made in his image.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Men and women designed to walk WITH HIM,
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; TO LOVE HIM, and to fill in heaven and
[1:09:35] earth WITH WITH WILLING, JOYFUL PRAISE.
[1:09:38] AND THE BIBLE SAYS IN ROMANS 8:14, AS
[1:09:41] MANY AS ARE LED BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD,
[1:09:44] THEY ARE THE SONS OF GOD. And they ARE
[1:09:47] THE OFFSPRING OF GOD, THE CHILDREN THAT
[1:09:51] ARE NOT BORN OF NATURAL DESCENT. NOR OF
[1:09:54] HUMAN DECISION OR A HUSBAND'S WILL BUT
[1:09:57] BORN OF GOD. THIS IS WHAT JOHN 1
[1:10:00] DECLARES that we ARE SONS NOT BORN OF
[1:10:03] NATURAL DESCENT NOT HUMAN DECISION OR A
[1:10:07] HUSBAND'S WILL BUT GOD'S OWN WILL AND
[1:10:10] PURPOSE.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO KNOW YOU ARE NOT AN
[1:10:14] ACCIDENT.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT EVEN AN AFTERTHOUGHT.
[1:10:18] YOU ARE A PRE-PLANNED INDIVIDUAL WHO GOD
[1:10:22] HAS CALLED BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE
[1:10:25] WORLD. AND HE PLACED IN YOU OF SEED A
[1:10:29] GENE OF GOD THAT WAS IN YOU. EVEN THOUGH
[1:10:32] YOUR BODY IS CORRUPTIBLE, THOUGH YOUR
[1:10:34] FLESH IS COME FROM SIN, YET HE PLACED
[1:10:38] WITHIN YOU A PART OF HIMSELF, AN
[1:10:40] ATTRIBUTE OF HIMSELF THAT ONLY THE
[1:10:43] SPIRIT OF GOD CAN AWAKEN.
[1:10:46] Nothing else can do it. You can try any
[1:10:49] kind of things that chaos has to offer
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; and it'll never awaken the predestinated
[1:10:54] seed. Only the spirit of God can do
[1:10:57] that.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; You see, this was the desire of God.
[1:11:03] Sons and daughters who will carry his
[1:11:05] light
[1:11:07] and so carry his likeness.
[1:11:10] In Psalms 82:6, he says, "I said you are
[1:11:13] God's and all of you are children of the
[1:11:16] most high,
[1:11:18] sons in his image." That's what GOD'S
[1:11:20] DESIRE IS.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; FILLED with his life, THOSE WHO WOULD
[1:11:25] CARRY HIS BREATH AND BY THEIR BREATH
[1:11:28] SPEAK HIS WORDS. A PEOPLE FILLED WITH
[1:11:32] HIS VOICE, PROPHESYING. YES. SPEAKING
[1:11:35] HIS WORD, DECLARING THE WONDROUS works
[1:11:38] of God. Amen.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; And this is God's great order. That's
[1:11:43] his order. And that is from silence to
[1:11:46] sound, from light to life, from angels
[1:11:50] to sons. You see, not a LONELY GOD, BUT
[1:11:54] A FATHER.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; GOD DESIRED FATHERHOOD. HE wanted a
[1:11:59] family. NOT A SILENT ETERNITY, BUT A
[1:12:03] LIVING FAMILY.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; CAN I SAY IT AGAIN? GOD WANTED YOU.
[1:12:09] YES.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; IT HAPPENS TO BE THAT BECAUSE OF OUR
[1:12:12] PARENTS' SINS THAT WE WERE BORN LOST AND
[1:12:15] AWAY FROM HIM.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; BUT HE DIDN'T COME TO SAVE EVERYBODY. HE
[1:12:20] CAME TO SEEK AND TO SAVE THAT WHICH WAS
[1:12:22] LOST.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; THOSE THAT WAS A PART OF HIM BEFORE THE
[1:12:26] WORLD BEGAN. THAT BECAUSE OF SIN, WE
[1:12:29] STRAYED AND WENT INTO CHAOS. BUT HE CAME
[1:12:32] TO SEEK AND TO SAVE THAT WHICH WAS LOST
[1:12:35] IN CHAOS AND BRING THEIR LIVES BACK IN
[1:12:38] ORDER AGAIN.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Everything he's done from the beginning
[1:12:46] has been moving toward one eternal
[1:12:49] desire
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; and that's Hebrews 2:10 that he might
[1:12:53] bring many sons unto glory.
[1:12:58] And this is the realm of DIVINE ORDER
[1:13:00] THAT TO THE NATURAL MIND it looks like
[1:13:03] chaos.
[1:13:05] YOU SEE, BECAUSE ALWAYS WHAT MAN CALLS
[1:13:08] DISORDER, GOD CALLS MOVEMENT.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; And what THE FLESH WILL LABEL AS
[1:13:14] CONFUSION, HEAVEN RECOGNIZES IT AS
[1:13:17] PRECISION in motion.
[1:13:20] For example, EZEKIEL WAS GIVEN A VISION
[1:13:23] THAT THAT THAT WILL ABSOLUTELY SHATTER
[1:13:25] THE IDEA OF humans of a perception OF
[1:13:29] ORDER. IT'S A REALM WHERE THE PRAISES OF
[1:13:32] GOD THUNDERED FROM THE CHERUBAM, WHERE
[1:13:36] WINGS WOULD BEAT TOGETHER, WHERE WHEELS
[1:13:39] TURNED, AND EVEN THE VERY POST OF THE
[1:13:42] TEMPLES moved as the spirit of God
[1:13:45] moved.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ezekiel 10:4 it says, "And the
[1:13:50] post of the door MOVED AT THE VOICE OF
[1:13:53] HIM that cried, and the house was filled
[1:13:56] with smoke."
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Now, when you look as a carnal observer,
[1:14:01] this looks like confusion. It looks
[1:14:05] unsettling. I mean, CHAOTIC
[1:14:08] CREATURES FULL OF EYES, WHEELS WITHIN
[1:14:12] WHEELS, MOTIONS WITHOUT PAWS. Yet
[1:14:16] Ezekiel makes it clear that in in
[1:14:19] Ezekiel 1:12, uh, WHETHERSOEVER THE
[1:14:22] SPIRIT WAS TO GO, THEY WENT, THEY TURNED
[1:14:25] NOT WHEN THEY WENT. And I I WANTED TO
[1:14:28] SAY TO YOU TODAY, oh that we might learn
[1:14:31] to do the same.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN. TO BE SO ONE WITH THE SPIRIT,
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; THAT AS HE MOVES, we moves.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; AS HE TURNS, WE TURN.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AS HE WE ARE FOLLOWING HIM AND
[1:14:45] EVERYTHING AND WE'RE MOVING IN UNISON
[1:14:48] WITH THE SPIRIT OF GOD BECAUSE THAT'S
[1:14:51] REAL DIVINE order
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; is when we move with the spirit of God
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; may we learn to do the same
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; but you see that's not chaos looks like
[1:15:02] it to the world looks like it to the
[1:15:04] mind all of these wheels turning in the
[1:15:06] wheels cherubam screaming holy holy holy
[1:15:09] all OF THIS NOISE SO MUCH SO LOUD UNTIL
[1:15:12] THE THE THE POST of the temple moves
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; IN VIBRATION AND UNITY. EVERYTHING
[1:15:19] MOVING TOGETHER
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; AT THE SOUND OF HEAVEN'S VOICE.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; And it looks like
[1:15:27] chaos,
[1:15:29] but it's not chaos. It's God's order.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; You see, it's perfect obedience.
[1:15:38] Every one of moving as the spirit moved.
[1:15:40] Yes,
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; that's what we want our lives.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; This is where we get into chaos
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; when we don't move where the spirit
[1:15:48] moves.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Come on, SOMEBODY. AMEN. YOU SEE, THERE
[1:15:52] WAS NOTHING LAGGING BEHIND. Everything
[1:15:54] was in unison. NOTHING WAS RUSHING
[1:15:56] AHEAD. HEAVEN WAS NOT A NOISY CONFUSION.
[1:16:00] IT WAS ORDERED RESPONSIVENESS.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Everything moving
[1:16:05] to his voice.
[1:16:08] Sometimes
[1:16:11] the satanic eye looks upon real
[1:16:13] spontaneous worship and sneers with
[1:16:16] scorn and cause it noisy confusion.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; But it isn't confusion.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; It isn't chaos.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Tim, ALL THEM PEOPLE DANCING
[1:16:30] IN THE SPIRIT AND SHOUTING THE PRAISES
[1:16:32] OF GOD AND RUNNING DOWN THE AISLES.
[1:16:35] THAT'S THAT'S JUST NOISE. SEE CONFUSION?
[1:16:38] THAT'S CHAOS. NO,
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; that's a response to God's divine order.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's ordered responsiveness.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Everyone moving as the spirit moves.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Everyone going as the spirit directs.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. No one rushing ahead. No one
[1:16:58] lagging behind. Everybody in unison
[1:17:00] together.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Come on. WOULDN'T YOU LIKE A CHURCH
[1:17:04] SERVICE THAT WOULD BE LIKE HEAVEN? AMEN.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; EVERY PERSON IN DIVINE ORDER.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; EVERY PERSON MOVING AS THE SPIRIT MOVES.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; NO ONE LAGGING BEHIND. NO ONE PULLING
[1:17:16] BACK. NO ONE RUSHING AHEAD AND GETTING
[1:17:19] IN THE CELL. BUT EVERY PERSON MOVING
[1:17:22] TOGETHER IN DIVINE HARMONY.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:31] But sometimes
[1:17:33] the eye of Satan looks on with scorn
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; and he sees this spontaneous worship and
[1:17:41] sneers with scorn
[1:17:44] thinking it's just noisy confusion.
[1:17:49] But I'll tell you THAT MORNING, THAT
[1:17:52] SUNDAY MORNING, WHEN SISTER LANA
[1:17:54] responded to the word and SHE ROSE UP
[1:17:58] GIVING PRAISE TO GOD AND SHE RAN
[1:18:01] SHOUTING AND PRAISING GOD ALL OVER THIS
[1:18:04] BUILDING. AROUND AND AROUND SHE WENT
[1:18:06] SHOUTING THE PRAISES OF GOD. THAT WAS
[1:18:09] NOT NOISY CONFUSION.
[1:18:11] THAT WAS ORDERED RESPONSIVENESS.
[1:18:14] AND LET ME TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED. THE
[1:18:16] CANCER WAS GONE. THE VICTORY WAS WON.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE IN THAT TIME OF CHAOS,
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; GOD BROUGHT HER BODY INTO ORDER.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; And in that moment, as the spirit of God
[1:18:32] moved through the audience, there were
[1:18:34] other healings took place. And as that
[1:18:38] anointing fell, we prayed over a prayer
[1:18:40] cloth, sent it to A MAN IN SOUTH AFRICA
[1:18:43] WHOSE wife had the third stages of of
[1:18:46] rectal cancer, and he was in distress,
[1:18:49] terrible distress, had lost his home,
[1:18:52] had to move in with his wife's parents,
[1:18:55] you know, not having a job for three
[1:18:57] years. And there when he received that
[1:19:00] prayer cloth, laid it upon his wife, she
[1:19:02] was healed of that cancer. And there
[1:19:06] immediately afterwards he he he received
[1:19:09] a job that had BEEN WAITING FOR SOMEONE
[1:19:12] TO FILL FOR THREE YEARS
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; held open FOR HIM
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD WOULD STEP INTO HIS CHAOS
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; and bring order.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. LATER ON, EVEN DURING CO, HE HE
[1:19:26] TOOK THAT SAME PRAYER CLOTH. HE DROVE, I
[1:19:29] DON'T KNOW HOW MANY MILES AND
[1:19:30] KILOMETERS, BUT HE DROVE maybe hundreds
[1:19:32] of miles, LAID IT ON HIS BROTHER WHO WAS
[1:19:35] DYING ON ON A RESPIRATOR, AND GOD healed
[1:19:38] him and raised him up.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you, THAT'S HOW GOD
[1:19:41] BRINGS order
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; out of chaos. A MAN LAYING THERE GASPING
[1:19:46] HIS LAST BREATH,
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; NEEDING A DIVINE MIRACLE AND THE
[1:19:51] DOCTOR'S LOOKING AT IT AS IMPOSSIBLE.
[1:19:54] BUT IN THAT MOMENT OF IMPOSSIBILITY, IN
[1:19:56] THAT MOMENT OF TERRIBLE CHAOS, GOD
[1:19:59] STEPPED IN ON THE SCENE and brought
[1:20:01] order
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; into his chaos.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:13] This is what the true bride should be
[1:20:15] doing.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Bringing order out of chaos
[1:20:20] because the spirit of God moves
[1:20:24] and they recognize it
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; and they're sensitive to it
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; and they don't lag behind
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; and they don't let them tell. Somebody
[1:20:32] tell them days of miracles are passed
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; or it was only for the divine healing
[1:20:37] campaigns. Oh no. You know, but but when
[1:20:41] WHEN THEY WILL PRESS THROUGH THE CHAOS
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; OF UNBELIEF AND ALLOW GOD TO BRING
[1:20:46] THINGS INTO order
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; because he's going to do it for someone.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Because God's in order, God of order,
[1:20:55] not of confusion.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Now, I quote this from brother Brandham.
[1:21:01] He said when she as Eve had the very
[1:21:04] filling of the word of God in her hand,
[1:21:06] she could have took God's word. But what
[1:21:08] did she do to that? Instead of tearing
[1:21:10] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost, let
[1:21:13] science prove to her the Holy Ghost was
[1:21:16] only for the disciples.
[1:21:18] Instead of keeping divine HEALING GOING,
[1:21:20] WHEN SHE OUGHT TO BE NOW RAISING THE
[1:21:22] DEAD, DOING GREAT MIRACLES, SHE HAS LET
[1:21:24] SATAN UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP of religious
[1:21:27] men take the word of God and try to say
[1:21:29] it was for another age. And she's
[1:21:32] believed it.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE BIBLE SAID, "THE THINGS THAT I
[1:21:36] DO, SAY YOU DO ALSO," Jesus said that
[1:21:40] and go ye unto all the world and preach
[1:21:42] the gospel to every creature. And we're
[1:21:44] still creatures. These signs shall
[1:21:46] follow every one of them that believe.
[1:21:48] And she denies every bit of it. SHE
[1:21:50] DENIES ALL THE SUPERNATURAL AND SHE
[1:21:52] SWAPPED IT FOR HIS INTELLECTUAL
[1:21:54] CONCEPTION OF THE BIBLE WHERE PRIESTS
[1:21:56] AND HOLY FATHERS SO-CALLED AND WHERE
[1:21:58] BISHOPS AND ARCHBISHOPS WERE WHERE
[1:22:00] DISTRICT PRESPITS AND GENERAL OVERSEERS
[1:22:03] and so forth has put their own
[1:22:04] interpretation to it. And God has left
[1:22:07] them set there dead as 12:00.
[1:22:14] And the only thing left in the last days
[1:22:16] is a bunch of little Pentecostals with a
[1:22:18] bunch of music whooped up as hard as
[1:22:19] they can, running up and down the floor,
[1:22:21] speaking in tongues and shouting and
[1:22:22] having a form of godliness, denying the
[1:22:24] word thereof. That's not us.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; We're not word deniers.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Tell them to be baptized in the name of
[1:22:32] Jesus Christ. Laugh in your face. That's
[1:22:34] not us.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; But that but that God goes right on
[1:22:39] making it just so just the same. Proving
[1:22:41] his word to be so.
[1:22:44] You know that day I think of it at the
[1:22:48] beginning of the church.
[1:22:51] Again, IT WAS THE GENESIS OF THE CHURCH.
[1:22:56] I done took you to the genesis of of of
[1:23:00] um OF GENESIS CHAPTER 1. TOOK YOU TO THE
[1:23:04] GENESIS OF JOHN CHAPTER ONE. In the
[1:23:06] beginning was the word. Now I'm taking
[1:23:09] you to the genesis of the church. her
[1:23:12] beginning and that was on the day of
[1:23:14] Pentecost.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; And the DAY THE PILLAR OF FIRE DESCENDED
[1:23:19] and divided itself
[1:23:22] resting on each one of them 120 in the
[1:23:24] upper room.
[1:23:26] Well, that moment WASN'T NOISY
[1:23:29] CONFUSION. It was it again was ordered
[1:23:32] responsiveness
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; to the will of God.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE FULFILLING THE WORD. LISTEN.
[1:23:38] ACTS 2 AND 3 SAID, "AND THERE APPEARED
[1:23:41] UNTO THEM CLOVEN TONGUES LIKE AS OF
[1:23:44] FIRE, AND IT SAT UPON each of them."
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; NOW,
[1:23:50] THE SAME THING THAT WAS IN THE BEGINNING
[1:23:52] WHEN GOD SAID, "LET THERE BE LIGHT."
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; AND CREATION BEGAN.
[1:23:58] AND OUT OF GOD CAME A HALO OF LIGHT
[1:24:02] THROUGH WHICH ALL CREATION WOULD BE
[1:24:04] FORMED. AND THROUGH THE WORD OF HIS
[1:24:07] POWER, HE WOULD BRING THE EARTH, THE
[1:24:09] MOON, THE STARS, THE GALAXIES INTO
[1:24:11] EXISTENCE.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; NOW, THIS SAME GOD STANDS
[1:24:17] BECAUSE HIS WHOLE DESIRE AND HIS DESIGN
[1:24:20] IS TO HAVE A FAMILY. HIS whole purpose
[1:24:23] IS TO HAVE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD.
[1:24:26] AND AT THE BEGINNING OF the new
[1:24:29] creation,
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN,
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY WITH ME NOW. AMEN. WHAT COMES
[1:24:34] OUT OF GOD? A HALO OF LIGHT,
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; A PILLAR OF FIRE. AMEN. And it IT'S IT
[1:24:40] IS BRINGING TO LIGHT THE PROMISED WORD
[1:24:43] OF JOEL CHAPTER 2.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT I'LL POUR OUT MY SPIRIT UPON
[1:24:47] ALL FLESH.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; MY SONS AND DAUGHTERS, THEY WILL
[1:24:50] PROPHESY BY ALL MY YOUNG MEN SHALL SEE
[1:24:53] VISIONS AND OLD MEN WILL SEE DREAMS.
[1:24:56] I'LL POUR OUT MY SPIRIT UPON ALL FLESH.
[1:24:58] HE WAS BRINGING THE PAST THE WORD OF
[1:25:01] EZEKIEL 36:26
[1:25:03] WHERE HE SAID THAT THAT I WILL GIVE YOU
[1:25:06] A NEW HEART AND A NEW SPIRIT AND THEN
[1:25:08] I'LL PUT MY SPIRIT IN YOU.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; AND THIS WAS THE COMING OF THE HOLY
[1:25:12] SPIRIT, THE THEOPHONY OF GOD, THE VERY
[1:25:15] PILLAR OF FIRE AS IT MOVES NOW TO TAKE
[1:25:18] ON BODIES,
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; A BODY, a multimembered body. And to do
[1:25:24] that, it divides itself in creation.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; What was he doing? He was bringing order
[1:25:33] out of the chaos of sin.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that will bring
[1:25:40] cha order is the Holy Ghost.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; The word made manifest.
[1:25:46] Now, I I want you to notice the
[1:25:49] precision. THE THE FIRE DIDN'T FALL
[1:25:51] RANDOMLY. It didn't fall
[1:25:54] indiscriminately.
[1:25:55] It divided. It rested. It filled. Every
[1:25:58] believer IS RECEIVED EXACTLY WHAT HEAVEN
[1:26:02] APPOINTED.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT FOLLOWED WAS SPEAKING IN
[1:26:05] TONGUES. Praise to God,
[1:26:09] PROCLAMATION, AND YES, PREACHING.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. AND THAT WAS NOT CHAOS,
[1:26:17] BUT IT WAS OBEDIENCE IN MOTION.
[1:26:20] AMEN.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Somebody help ME PREACH NOW.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IN ACTS CHAPTER 2 AND 4, THEY WERE
[1:26:26] ALL FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND BEGAN
[1:26:28] to speak in other tongues as the spirit
[1:26:32] gave them utterance.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice this was not as
[1:26:36] emotion dictated.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; This was not as men decided.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; THIS WAS AS THE SPIRIT GAVE THEM
[1:26:44] UTTERANCE.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; THIS WAS NOT DISORDERED. THIS WAS THIS
[1:26:48] WAS ORDERED, STRUCTURED WORSHIP BY THE
[1:26:51] HOLY GHOST. IT WAS OBEDIENCE TO THE
[1:26:53] SPIRIT,
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; but to the onlooker,
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; to the scarnner,
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; to the scoffer. And listen, this
[1:27:02] scoffing would cause Israel to be cut
[1:27:05] off.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; THIS SCOFFING THAT TOOK PLACE RIGHT HERE
[1:27:10] WAS A DAY OF JUDGMENT.
[1:27:13] WHEN ISRAEL REFUSED THE ORDER OF GOD AND
[1:27:16] CONTINUED ON IN THE CHAOS OF THEIR
[1:27:18] RELIGION
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; AND GOD CUT OFF THE OLIVE TREES BRANCH
[1:27:23] AND HE GRAFTED IN A WILD OLIVE BRANCH,
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; YOU AND ME, GENTILES, PEOPLE WITHOUT A
[1:27:29] HOPE.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church?
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND BECAUSE THEY SCORNED IT, GOD
[1:27:37] WOULD SEND THEM into horrible
[1:27:39] tribulation and a dispersal.
[1:27:42] That's right.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Where they were dispersed among the
[1:27:44] nations
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; and have been so a scattered people
[1:27:48] until God's word had promised a
[1:27:50] reathering
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; where he has them gathered now
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; where he can bring them out of that
[1:27:56] chaos
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; and bring order. Yes.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you to the onlooker that
[1:28:05] day.
[1:28:08] You know,
[1:28:10] it sounded like it well, IT WAS
[1:28:12] OVERWHELMING TO THEM. IT IT WAS LIKE
[1:28:15] DRUNKEN CHAOS,
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; BUT HEAVEN RECOGNIZED IT IS PERFECT
[1:28:20] ORDER.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO SEE SOMETHING. WHAT THEY
[1:28:24] WERE CALLING CHAOS,
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; DRUNKEN DISORDER.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD WAS PUTTING A CHURCH IN ORDER,
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; IN DIVINE ORDER,
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; TO BE AS HEAVEN AS IN ORDER.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Listen, it was not drunk and
[1:28:43] disorder. THIS WAS DIVINE CONTROL. This
[1:28:46] is men and women moving as the spirit
[1:28:48] moved, speaking as the spirit gave them
[1:28:51] utterance.
[1:28:53] AMEN. COME ON. THIS IS DIVINE ORDER.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHERE GOD MOVES. HE WANTS HIS
[1:28:58] PEOPLE IN ORDER WITH HIM, MOVING AS he
[1:29:01] moves, YIELDED TO HIS SPIRIT,
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; DIRECTED BY THE HOLY GHOST, LED BY THE
[1:29:07] SPIRIT OF GOD.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; You see, the same spirit that orders
[1:29:14] galaxy was now ordering sons.
[1:29:18] The same spirit that had put angels into
[1:29:21] perfect order of worship was now
[1:29:24] expressing it in sons born of the
[1:29:28] spirit.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; The book of revelation
[1:29:33] in chapter 5, it gives us another
[1:29:35] picture of heaven itself.
[1:29:38] And when the lamb takes the book
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; and begins to break the seals and and I
[1:29:44] want you JUST A MO JUST TO get this for
[1:29:46] a moment is something is happening in
[1:29:50] the heavens.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; THERE HAS TO BE A CORRESPONDING
[1:29:54] RESPONSE ON earth
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; where heaven touches the earth. NOW
[1:29:59] WHERE HEAVEN ISN'T THERE ON THE EARTH,
[1:30:01] NO IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THEM.
[1:30:04] BUT THOSE WHO ARE IN HEAVENLY PLACES,
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; THOSE WHO ARE UNDER THAT DIVINE
[1:30:09] UNCCTION, WHEN HEAVEN MOVES, THEY MOVE.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. AND WHEN THE LAMB WOULD TAKE
[1:30:16] THE BOOK AND OPEN THE SEALS, WHAT WOULD
[1:30:19] HAPPEN ON THE EARTH? THOSE MYSTERIES
[1:30:22] WOULD BE REVEALED TO A PEOPLE ON THE
[1:30:24] EARTH.
[1:30:26] YOU SEE, IT WAS A A SYNCHRONIZATION. IT
[1:30:29] WAS US MOVED AS AS THE SPIRIT MOVED, we
[1:30:32] moved.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE MOVED. COME ON, SOMEBODY HELP
[1:30:36] ME PREACH.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THE BIBLE SAID AGAIN THAT WHEN
[1:30:41] THE SEALS WAS OPEN FOR THE LAMB TAKING
[1:30:44] THE BOOK, THE RESPONSE OF HEAVEN was
[1:30:47] immediate and it was unified. IN
[1:30:50] REVELATION 5 AND 8, THE FOUR AND 20
[1:30:52] ELDERS FELL DOWN BEFORE the lamb
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; and they sung a new song.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Think of that, YOU KNOW, AGAIN IN VERSE
[1:31:00] 13, YOU YOU'LL SEE ANGELS JOIN IN AND
[1:31:05] SAINTS RESPONDING. CREATION ITSELF
[1:31:08] SWELLS WITH WORSHIP AS HE SAID, "AND
[1:31:10] EVERY CREATURE which is in heaven, oh
[1:31:14] now, AND ON THE EARTH,
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; AND SUCH AS ARE IN THE SEA, AND ALL THAT
[1:31:18] IN THEM HEARD I SAY, BLESSED and honor,
[1:31:22] and glory, AND POWER BE UNTO HIM THAT
[1:31:25] SITETH UPON THE THRONE, and the lamb
[1:31:27] forever more."
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, THESE TRUTHS WERE NOT
[1:31:31] GIVEN YOU TO PUFF YOU UP WITH KNOWLEDGE.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEY WERE NOT THERE TO MAKE YOU
[1:31:36] BIG BIG
[1:31:39] WITH WITH BIG STUFFED SHIRTS. NO, HE WAS
[1:31:41] TO MAKE YOU COME DOWN TO THE POINT WHERE
[1:31:43] YOU FALL BEFORE THE LAMB AND GIVE HIM
[1:31:46] PRAISE AND GLORY AND HONOR SUBMITTING
[1:31:49] YOUR LIFE. LET HIM BRING YOU INTO DIVINE
[1:31:53] ORDER AND MAN YOU MATCHING THE THE WITH
[1:31:56] SYNCHRONY with heaven.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; That was not confusion.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; No, what we're reading there is not
[1:32:03] confusion. That's heaven's symphony.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every voice entering in at the
[1:32:08] right moment. EVERY RESPONSE FLOWING
[1:32:11] FROM REVELATION.
[1:32:13] No one's competing.
[1:32:16] NO ONE'S DISRUPTING.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; NO ONE'S SEEKING EMOTION.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; ALL ARE CENTERED ON THE LAMB.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT MAN MIGHT CALL OVERWHELMING O
[1:32:26] OVERWHELMING SOUND, GOD. HE CALLS IT
[1:32:29] PERFECT HARMONY. HE SAID IT'S A NEW
[1:32:32] SONG. THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; THAT WITH THE SEALS OPEN, IT BRINGS YOU
[1:32:36] INTO A A SYNCHRONIZED WORSHIP WITH
[1:32:40] HEAVEN. OH, WE have we try
[1:32:42] synchronization here on man with man.
[1:32:45] Come on, church.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. THE LUTHERANS WILL SET OUT THEIR
[1:32:49] SUNDAY SCHOOL lesson today for everybody
[1:32:51] to read.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; THE BAPTIST WILL SEND FROM THE
[1:32:54] HEADQUARTER the the lesson that the
[1:32:57] preacher is to read.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; You see, THAT IS MAN'S ORDER. THAT IS
[1:33:02] MAN SYNCHRONIZING.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE HAVE A WE HAVE ONE WHO WANTS TO
[1:33:07] BE THE HEADQUARTERS IN JEFFERSONVILLE
[1:33:09] THAT WANTS TO SYNCHRONIZE EVERYBODY LIKE
[1:33:12] THE TOWER OF BABEL.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WITH WITH ONE ONE CERTAIN TAPE TO
[1:33:17] LISTEN TO.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S MAN'S ORDER. THAT'S MAN'S
[1:33:25] ORDER. THAT'S CARNAL MAN TRYING TO BRING
[1:33:28] THINGS UNDER CONTROL. BUT I TELL YOU,
[1:33:31] WHEN THE WHEN THE HOLY GHOST TAKES
[1:33:33] CONTROL, HE WILL TAKE A MAN THAT DON'T
[1:33:35] KNOW ANYTHING AND TAKE HIM OVER AND
[1:33:38] SPEAK THROUGH HIS VOICE AND PREACH THE
[1:33:40] WORD OF GOD. AND WHEN HE DOES, DEMONS
[1:33:42] FLEE. THE POWER OF GOD MOVES. PEOPLE ARE
[1:33:45] HEALED, DELIVERED, SAVED, SINNERS RUN TO
[1:33:48] THE ALTAR.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; And when the lamb is central, worship
[1:33:57] becomes unified.
[1:33:59] And when the spirit leads, expression
[1:34:02] becomes synchronized.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; And from Pentecost to the throne room,
[1:34:07] the pattern is the same. Heaven moves
[1:34:10] together, responds together, and
[1:34:13] worships together.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Each part doing exactly what it was
[1:34:18] created to do.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; That's divine order.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not silence,
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; but spirit governs sound. As Ezekiel
[1:34:30] 1:21 says, "AND WHERE THOSE WENT, THESE
[1:34:34] WENT. WHEN THOSE STOOD, THESE STOOD. FOR
[1:34:37] THE SPIRIT OF THE LIVING GOD WAS in the
[1:34:40] wheels.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Even the temple itself responded.
[1:34:48] fixed structures like the post
[1:34:50] thresholds,
[1:34:52] places where that men assume is
[1:34:56] immovable.
[1:34:58] They begin to shift under the weight OF
[1:35:00] GOD'S GLORY.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE in God's economy,
[1:35:05] THERE IS NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT than
[1:35:07] alignment with his spirit. Amen.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; FOR PEOPLE TO BE UNIFIED WITH HIM.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; AND AND GOD WAS SHOWING EZEKIEL THAT
[1:35:17] TRUE ORDER IS IS NOT BEING RIGID.
[1:35:21] IT'S NOT BEING A STUFFED SHIRT.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT BEING COLD AS AN ICEBERG.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT BEING A COLD MORG. IT IS
[1:35:29] SENSITIVITY. IT'S NOT FORM WITHOUT LIFE,
[1:35:31] BUT IT IS LIFE DIRECTING FORM. AS HE
[1:35:34] SAID IN ZECHARIAH, NOT BY MIGHT AND NOT
[1:35:38] BY POWER, BUT BY MY SPIRIT, SAYAETH THE
[1:35:41] LORD.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; But this is where man so often stumbles.
[1:35:49] We would rather have formality than his
[1:35:52] presence.
[1:35:55] We would rather have control over
[1:35:58] command.
[1:35:59] We would have rather have man would
[1:36:02] rather have the routine of rituals over
[1:36:06] revelation.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; But when God moves,
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; oh let me say it. When God moves,
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER WHAT BROUGHT ABOUT CREATION?
[1:36:17] THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVED.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND WHEN GOD MOVES, IT IT WILL
[1:36:23] DISTURB OUR NEED ARRANGEMENTS.
[1:36:26] IT DEFIES MAN'S ORDER
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE MAN'S ORDER IS CHAOS.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; YET, HE'S STILL THE GOD OF ORDER.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; THE SCRIPTURE tells us plainly in in 1
[1:36:38] Corinthians 14:33, God is not the author
[1:36:41] of confusion,
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; but the author of peace. Let's have a
[1:36:47] little understanding there
[1:36:53] because too often
[1:36:56] we think the peace of God
[1:36:59] is stillness.
[1:37:02] But the peace of God does not always
[1:37:04] mean stillness.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; It means everything moving
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; exactly as the spirit wheels.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Somebody write it down.
[1:37:15] Amen. The peace of God is not always
[1:37:18] mean stillness.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; It means everything moving EXACTLY
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; AS the spirit wills.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT EZEKIEL SAW IN HEAVEN IS IT
[1:37:30] OUGHT TO TEACH US A LESSON TODAY THAT
[1:37:32] WHEN PRAISE GOES FORTH, WHEN WHEN THE
[1:37:34] SPIRIT MOVES, everything aligned WITH
[1:37:36] HIM MUST BE WILLING TO MOVE to even the
[1:37:40] post. Amen.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Come on, SOMEBODY. YOU MAY BE HERE IN
[1:37:46] THIS CHURCH AND YOU THINK YOU'RE JUST
[1:37:48] THE POST.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; AND MAYBE YOU JUST FEEL AS DEAD AS A
[1:37:52] POST DOES.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; BUT I'LL TELL YOU, IN THE ME in the
[1:37:56] MIDDLE OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD, DEAD THINGS
[1:37:58] COME ALIVE.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; AARON'S ROD THAT WAS DRY AND WITHERED
[1:38:03] BLOOMED AGAIN AND BORE FRUIT.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU MOVE INTO GOD'S SPIRIT, THINGS
[1:38:08] COME ALIVE. AMEN.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Praise begins to happen.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; The joy bells begin to roll.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God begins to move.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Creation begins. And light dawn. And as
[1:38:20] light dawn, revelation comes.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; And there's no revelation greater than
[1:38:28] the revelation.
[1:38:29] I'm a son of God.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; I'm a child of the king.
[1:38:39] So if God can move pillars of a temple,
[1:38:44] it can certainly move our traditions
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; and rearrange them.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; It can move our expectations.
[1:38:54] It can move you out of your comfort
[1:38:56] zone.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; When God moves, HE BRINGS ORDER OUT OF
[1:39:01] CHAOS.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; SO WHAT AM I TELLING YOU?
[1:39:05] WHAT AM I TELLING YOU FOR THE YEAR TO
[1:39:07] COME? Get ready to move
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD IS MOVING.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; And when he moves, HIS BRIDE HAS TO MOVE
[1:39:17] WITH HIM.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE THOSE WHERE THOSE WENT,
[1:39:21] THESE WENT. WHEN THESE STOOD, THESE
[1:39:23] STOOD. BUT THE SPIRIT OF THE LIVING GOD
[1:39:25] WAS IN THE WHEELS. WHEN GOD MOVES BY HIS
[1:39:28] SPIRIT,
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; where he goes, we goes. Where he stands,
[1:39:31] we stand.
[1:39:35] And whatever he can lead your faith to
[1:39:37] believe, that's yours.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; This is how God brings order out of what
[1:39:47] man calls chaos.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; By placing his spirit in the center and
[1:39:52] let everything else respond in
[1:39:55] obedience.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; You know, we and I've seen it. You've
[1:40:00] seen it. I've been in churches
[1:40:04] where it's it's it's there. It's their
[1:40:08] motto. It's there way way up high for
[1:40:11] every eye to see. The scripture of
[1:40:14] Psalms 46:10,
[1:40:17] be still and know that I am God.
[1:40:25] And most of them take it as a command
[1:40:29] for everybody to fall silent.
[1:40:36] But it's not a command for heaven to
[1:40:38] fall silent.
[1:40:40] And let me stop here.
[1:40:43] where we're at this morning.
[1:40:45] WE'RE NOT JUST IN AN EARTHLY REALM.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; But we are in a heavenly realm,
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; the Bible SAID HE HATH MADE US TO SIT IN
[1:40:54] HEAVENLY PLACES.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; And here WHEN THE WORD GOES FORTH AND
[1:40:58] THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT MOVES,
[1:41:00] THAT'S HEAVEN COMING DOWN.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; AND SO YOU SEE THIS THIS PSALMS RIGHT
[1:41:06] HERE IS NOT A COMMAND FOR HEAVEN TO FALL
[1:41:09] SILENCE. IT'S NOT A CALL FOR FOR PRAISE
[1:41:12] TO CEASE.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT IT'S NOT INVITING US TO
[1:41:16] LIFELESSNESS.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Do you KNOW TO HAVE DEAD FORMAL COLD
[1:41:23] WORSHIP AND POWERLESS RELIGION?
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; RELIGION WITHOUT MO EMOTION.
[1:41:29] ARE YOU WITH ME?
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; A RELIGION THAT GOD HATES. THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; WELL, we're not supposed to be
[1:41:39] emotional. Listen, God's emotional.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; He loves, he hates.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; The Bible said he weeps.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; He even laughs.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; He sings.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; This is all scriptures of your God.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; He's a God of emotion.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; His people also are people of emotion.
[1:42:01] It's not an emotionalist religion.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; But neither is an emotion without
[1:42:06] direction. It's an ordered emotion by
[1:42:08] the spirit.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; But I just want to tell you, God has
[1:42:15] never desired mute worship.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; He never wants a manufactured stillness
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; THAT WILL REPLACE HIS LIFE WITH SOME
[1:42:28] RITUAL.
[1:42:30] Heaven has never been quiet.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah. SCRIPTURE CONSISTENTLY PORTRAYS
[1:42:37] HEAVEN AS ALIVE with sound and worship
[1:42:40] and response.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; ISAIAH HEARD THE SERAPHIMS CRYING,
[1:42:44] "HOLY, HOLY, HOLY is the Lord of the
[1:42:47] host."
[1:42:49] JOHN WOULD ALSO HAVE THE SAME REALITY
[1:42:51] WHEN HE SAYS IN REVELATION 4:8, "THEY
[1:42:54] REST NOT DAY AND NIGHT, SAYING, "HOLY,
[1:42:56] HOLY, HOLY."
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:42:59] HEAVEN DOES NOT SHUT DOWN. IT UTTERS.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; MAN WILL SHUT DOWN ON GOD.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD DON'T EVER SHUT DOWN.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Heaven is never silenced. And when
[1:43:12] heaven COMES DOWN INTO A CHURCH, THEY
[1:43:15] move as he moves.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; AS THE WORD GOES FORTH, PEOPLE RESPOND.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN. When the king is in the midst,
[1:43:24] AMEN. THEY'VE GOT THE SHOUT OF THE KING
[1:43:26] AMONG THEM. WHY? BECAUSE THERE'S A
[1:43:28] LIVING GOD AMONG THEM, RESURRECTED,
[1:43:31] SHOWING SIGNS AND WONDERS, GOD'S CHURCH,
[1:43:34] MOVING FROM GLORY TO GLORY.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; By the way, that's a quote from the
[1:43:38] prophet of God.
[1:43:41] And we believe
[1:43:43] that there's to be a church in this last
[1:43:44] day. How many believes it?
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; How many believes you're part of that
[1:43:48] church?
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; A church that will receive both the
[1:43:51] former and latter reign.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that that has happened.
[1:43:56] Amen.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; The latter the the former reign which is
[1:44:00] which is the teaching reign. The latter
[1:44:02] reign which is rapturing faith. This
[1:44:04] message is rapturing faith.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; And as brother Brandham said, IT'LL BE
[1:44:13] SCATTERED throughout the world in this
[1:44:14] leodyian age. It'll be a CHURCH THAT'S
[1:44:17] CALLED BACK TO THE ORIGINAL FAITH. It'll
[1:44:19] be a church that HAVE JESUS CHRIST
[1:44:21] WALKING in it, MANIFESTING HIMSELF. THE
[1:44:24] SHOUT OF THE KING WILL be in it. They
[1:44:26] said THERE WAS A SHOUT OF THE KING IN
[1:44:28] THE CAMP. WHAT? WHAT? THE SHOUT OF THE
[1:44:30] KING. SCREAMS AND JOY. WHAT OF ANOTHER
[1:44:34] KINGDOM?
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS DIVINE HEALING. THERE WAS A
[1:44:38] SHOUT OF THE KING IN THE CAMP. GREAT
[1:44:40] SIGNS, DIVINE HEALING, WONDERS AND
[1:44:43] THINGS PERFORMED AMONG THEM. IT'S A SIGN
[1:44:45] OF A LIVING GOD among his people.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Heaven is never silent.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Heaven is full of life.
[1:44:54] Come on.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandham told the man
[1:44:58] who said, "Brother Brandom, you know,
[1:44:59] when them people got screaming and
[1:45:01] shouting in that church, it could run
[1:45:03] cold chills all over me." He said,
[1:45:05] "Brother, you don't ever want to go to
[1:45:07] heaven
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; because if you go to heaven, you'll
[1:45:09] freeze to death."
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Because in heaven, it's going to be
[1:45:13] shouting and screaming and rejoicing.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:21] You see,
[1:45:24] heaven is NEVER SILENT. IT'S ALWAYS FULL
[1:45:27] OF LIFE.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HEAVEN COMES DOWN IN THE
[1:45:30] CHURCH, chaos ceases.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE LIFE IS THERE.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; THERE'S POWER THERE. THERE'S HEALING
[1:45:39] THERE. Restoration is there.
[1:45:43] BECAUSE WHEN HE STEPS INTO YOUR CHAOS,
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; HE COMES TO BRING ORDER.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; YES, he does.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; Now, the only place in the scripture
[1:45:54] that speaks of silence as heaven is very
[1:45:56] specific and very limited.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Let let me just dis dispel a a theory of
[1:46:05] man that has went haywire,
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; that is out of sync with God's word. I'm
[1:46:11] going to show you. It's Revelation 8
[1:46:13] and1. I'll let him put it up for you.
[1:46:16] And when he had opened the seventh seal,
[1:46:18] THERE WAS SILENCE in heaven about the
[1:46:21] space of a half an hour.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Somehow we get a notion, you know, when
[1:46:26] the seventh seal is open
[1:46:28] that it BEGINS A TIME of silence.
[1:46:33] It doesn't begin a time of silence. It
[1:46:35] ends the silence.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you SAY, "WELL, WE BELIEVE THE
[1:46:41] SEVENTH SEAL IS OPEN." THEN YOU HAVE TO
[1:46:43] BELIEVE THE SILENCE
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; HAS BEEN BROKEN.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; WHAT GOD HELD BACK IS A MYSTERY HAS NOW
[1:46:51] BEEN REVEALED.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; You see, this was not heaven becoming
[1:46:58] empty.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; It was It was not worship ceasing. IT
[1:47:03] WAS NOT CHRIST LEAVING HEAVEN.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; WELL, Christ left heaven. That's why
[1:47:09] heaven was silent because he was coming
[1:47:10] down in 1963 to open the seals.
[1:47:14] Uh what confusion, chaos again,
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; man's interpretation.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; You see, this was not heaven becoming
[1:47:24] empty. It was not worship ceasing. It
[1:47:26] was not Christ leaving heaven. It this
[1:47:30] was a visionary pause. It was a
[1:47:32] deliberate withholding of revelation.
[1:47:35] Amen.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; THE SILENCE WAS NOT THE ABSENCE OF LIFE.
[1:47:38] It was the absence of explanation.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; You see, this the SEVENTH SEAL CONCERNS
[1:47:46] THE COMING OF THE LORD. And and the
[1:47:48] meaning of that event was
[1:47:51] INTENTIONALLY SEALED UP.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; God said, "I ain't going to let it
[1:47:56] know." John was not permitted to write
[1:47:58] it.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. He writes there in Revelation 10:4
[1:48:02] when when the seven thunders had uttered
[1:48:04] their voices, I WAS ABOUT TO WRITE AND I
[1:48:06] heard a voice from heaven saying to me,
[1:48:08] "SEAL UP THOSE THINGS WHICH THE SEVEN
[1:48:10] THUNDERS UTTERED AND WRITE THEM NOT."
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; But I want you to understand something.
[1:48:17] Silence in heaven, THAT SILENCE WAS NOT
[1:48:20] permanent
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; and it WAS NOT EMPTINESS.
[1:48:24] WHAT IT WAS WAS A MYSTERY RESERVED AND
[1:48:27] HELD BACK TO THE END TIME.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; And that mystery would be hidden, REMAIN
[1:48:33] HIDDEN THROUGH SEVEN CHURCH AGES UNTIL
[1:48:36] THE APPOINTED TIME.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; You want TO KNOW THE BIBLE TELLS US
[1:48:40] EXACTLY WHEN THAT SILENCE would be
[1:48:42] broken. Revelation 10:7, BUT IN THE DAYS
[1:48:47] OF THE VOICE OF THE SEVENTH ANGEL, WHEN
[1:48:50] HE SHALL BEGIN THE SOUND, THE MYSTERY OF
[1:48:52] GOD SHALL BE FINISHED. AS HE HAVE
[1:48:54] DECLARED TO HIS SERVANTS the prophets.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; When that message sounds, the silence
[1:49:02] ends.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; What was held back is released.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; The seven thunders which had the voices
[1:49:09] all along were no longer restrained.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Heaven was never mute.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; It was simply not yet time.
[1:49:18] And even today there is a portion of
[1:49:20] that one aspect OF IT THAT IS HELD BACK.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Do you know when BROTHER BRANDON TALKS
[1:49:27] ABOUT THE SEVENTH SEAL BEING OPEN AND HE
[1:49:29] WILL SAY IT'S NOT OPEN HE IS TALKING
[1:49:32] ABOUT a specific part of it.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; You know WHAT IT IS IS MATTHEW 24:36.
[1:49:39] BUT OF THAT DAY AND HOUR KNOW IT NO MAN.
[1:49:43] AMEN.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; BUT AT THAT DAY AND HOUR, HEAVEN IS
[1:49:46] SILENT.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU SEE, THIS IS NOT BECAUSE
[1:49:51] HEAVEN IS EMPTY OR INACTIVE OR BECAUSE
[1:49:54] GOD, BUT BECAUSE GOD HAS CHOSEN TO KEEP
[1:49:57] THAT MOMENT IN HIS OWN AUTHORITY.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS in in Acts 1 and7.
[1:50:03] He said THIS IS HELD IN GOD'S AUTHORITY
[1:50:05] OF THAT TIME. THEY WERE ASKING WHEN WHEN
[1:50:07] WILL YOU DO THIS? WHEN WILL YOU DO THAT?
[1:50:09] YOU KNOW, HE'S ABOUT TO LEAVE. HE SAID
[1:50:11] THAT AIN'T FOR YOU TO KNOW. That's
[1:50:12] right.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; I'LL TELL YOU WHAT YOU YOU TO KNOW. YOU
[1:50:16] KNOW THE COMING YOU NEED TO TO TO BE
[1:50:18] INTERESTED IN IS THIS ONE.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; TEAR YOU IN JERUSALEM
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; UNTIL YOU ARE ENDUED WITH POWER FROM ON
[1:50:25] HIGH.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE COMING YOU GOT TO GET.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; AND I'LL TELL YOU CHURCH, IF YOU DON'T
[1:50:30] GET THAT COMING, YOU WON'T GET HIS
[1:50:32] SECOND COMING.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; You won't meet him in the air.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost has got to come. You got
[1:50:38] to be a part of that coming first
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; to be part of his physical coming.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Is everybody with me?
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; So that day and that hour and so brother
[1:50:52] Brandham when that part of the
[1:50:54] revelation came he said I know what it
[1:50:56] is and one thing is it is that third
[1:50:59] pull but is the third pull. Third pull
[1:51:02] is not squirrels.
[1:51:04] Third pull is not creating squirrels.
[1:51:07] It's not speaking storms out of
[1:51:09] existence. It's not salvation of Herit's
[1:51:13] children. That's not the third pull.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Those are vindications of the third
[1:51:18] pull.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; The third pull was the opening of the
[1:51:23] seven seals,
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; the revealing of the mysteries. that
[1:51:27] that to make it simple rather than pull
[1:51:31] the third phase of brother Brandham's
[1:51:34] ministry
[1:51:35] was to open up the seals
[1:51:40] to reveal the mystery. So, one thing it
[1:51:44] was that third pull.
[1:51:48] Remember he told him before WHEN HE WAS
[1:51:50] PRAYING ABOUT HIS END AND HE SAID, "I
[1:51:52] CAN'T I CAN'T SURVIVE THAT BLAST. I
[1:51:55] DON'T SEE HOW I COULD." AND HE GOES out
[1:51:58] onto up there on um there at Sabina
[1:52:03] Canyon. And at SABINA CANYON, HIS HANDS
[1:52:06] UP SAYING, "OH GOD, WHAT IS MY FUTURE?
[1:52:08] WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO THIS BLAST? I
[1:52:10] DON'T KNOW HOW I COULD SURVIVE IT. And
[1:52:13] something strikes his hand
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; and it's a sword.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; And he said, "A sword? What do you do
[1:52:19] with a sword? Unite with, you know,
[1:52:21] that's what man does. He knits. He
[1:52:23] elects people and followers and he, you
[1:52:26] know, he he makes this and bishops and
[1:52:28] popes and whatever.
[1:52:31] What do you do with a sword?" He said,
[1:52:32] "This is not a king's sword.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; This is the king's sword.
[1:52:38] It is that third pull.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; It was the word coming to a prophet.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; So the seventh seal was the word
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; coming to a message.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; And the it was those seven thunders
[1:52:56] uttered right in a row which had taken
[1:52:59] place every day. THE VOICE OF GOD WAS
[1:53:01] RELEASED,
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; MAKING KNOWN THE MYSTERY THAT WAS
[1:53:05] WRITTEN, THAT PART WHICH WAS IN SYMBOL
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; OF THE SEVEN SEALS. AND NOW, NOW WE KNOW
[1:53:12] WHAT THE FIRST SEAL IS. We know when he
[1:53:16] rides.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Why? BECAUSE THE VOICE OF GOD THUNDERED
[1:53:19] OUT
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; AND REVEALED THE MYSTERY.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; SO THAT WHICH WAS ONCE SECRET IS NOW
[1:53:25] KNOWN. AND IT AND IT UTTERED RIGHT in
[1:53:27] the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 as every night an
[1:53:32] angel of God would come a visitor from
[1:53:35] the pillar of fire.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; And would reveal the mystery of that
[1:53:39] seal.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; So it was it was those seven thunders.
[1:53:48] And then he said there was another part
[1:53:50] and it went by me so fast
[1:53:53] and it was in another tongue
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; and I couldn't make out the
[1:53:57] interpretation
[1:53:59] because no one will know the day or the
[1:54:04] hour.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; He said it's the thing that Jesus was
[1:54:09] silent about.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; And when they asked him Lord when will
[1:54:14] you will you return? BECAUSE THEY WERE
[1:54:17] SAYING, "OKAY, WHEN WILL THESE THINGS
[1:54:18] BE? WHEN WHEN WILL IT BE THAT THAT THAT
[1:54:20] THE CITY WILL BE SURROUNDED? AND WHEN
[1:54:22] WILL be that it would be a great
[1:54:24] persecution? AND WHEN WILL THAT THIS
[1:54:25] HAPPEN? AND WHEN WILL THAT and and WHAT
[1:54:27] IS WHAT IS WHAT ABOUT YOUR COMING?
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; But at that day and hour,
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; I have to be silent about."
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:54:39] Satan would do great damage with it.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because God wants you
[1:54:47] under expectancy,
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; not to look for him in the year 1977
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; or in the in a year of 20125 and dates
[1:54:56] COME AND DATES GO.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; BUT FOR YOU TO LIVE EVERY DAY
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; EXPECTING him to come.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; A PEOPLE WHO ARE READY, WHO ARE
[1:55:05] PREPARED,
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; A PEOPLE WHO ARE ON FIRE, WHO ARE PRAYED
[1:55:09] UP,
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; WHO HAVE MADE THEIREL READY.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY WITH ME. AMEN.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; But the idea
[1:55:20] that heaven became silent and vacant
[1:55:22] because Christ came down in 1963, that's
[1:55:25] not even supported by scripture.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; God has come down many times.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't being went to heaven
[1:55:33] emptied and worship stopped.
[1:55:36] Hey, you God came down. Look, look, put
[1:55:39] up this Genesis 11:5.
[1:55:42] God came down TO SEE WHAT MEN WERE DOING
[1:55:44] AT BABEL.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; And the LORD CAME DOWN TO SEE THE city
[1:55:48] and the tower
[1:55:50] which the children of man builded.
[1:55:54] Look at Genesis 18:21.
[1:55:56] GOD CAME DOWN to Abraham concerning
[1:55:59] Sodom. Yeah.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; Genesis 18:21 said, "I will go down now
[1:56:04] and see whether they have done all
[1:56:06] together according to the cry of it."
[1:56:11] In Exodus 3 and 7, GOD CAME DOWN TO
[1:56:15] MOSES IN A PILLAR of fire. He said, "I
[1:56:18] HAVE SURELY SEEN THE AFFLICTION OF MY
[1:56:20] PEOPLE, AND I HAVE COME down
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; to deliver." Yes, sir.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; BUT NONE OF THESE CASES CAUSED HEAVEN TO
[1:56:30] CEASE FUNCTIONING.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; NONE OF THIS emptied heaven.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; No, it wasn't emptying heaven. It was
[1:56:38] expanding heaven.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; HEAVEN WOULD BE EXPANDED AS GOD CAME
[1:56:45] DOWN TO EARTH BRINGING HEAVEN WITH HIM.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; CUZ EVERYWHERE GOD IS, HEAVEN IS.
[1:56:57] AMEN. DO YOU KNOW BROTHER BRANDON SAID
[1:56:58] THE RESURRECTION RAPTURE WILL BE IN THE
[1:57:01] PLACE THAT IS EXPANDED TO REDEEM US
[1:57:04] BECAUSE HE WILL LEAVE THE THRONE AND
[1:57:07] THERE MEET US IN the air in A HE SAYS HE
[1:57:10] EXPANDS HEAVEN AND THE SAINTS COME INTO
[1:57:13] THIS DIMENSION AND TOGETHER WE RISE TO
[1:57:16] MEET THE LORD in the air
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; and we won't be earthly people anymore
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; but heavenly people.
[1:57:32] I hope this ain't going over your head.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; I hope you're absorbing it.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; If you're with me, say, "Amen."
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; But in none of these cases did heaven
[1:57:45] cease functioning. Worship didn't stop.
[1:57:48] Angels were not dismissed. God's descent
[1:57:51] never empties heaven.
[1:57:54] It demonstrates his involvement. Yes.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; And the same is true with God because
[1:58:01] God was in Christ
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; reconciling the world to himself.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; But was heaven empty for three and a
[1:58:09] half years?
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:58:13] Because even in the incarnation, Jesus
[1:58:15] said in John 3:13, you can put this up
[1:58:18] and I'm just going to use the phrase of
[1:58:20] it, the son of man which is in heaven.
[1:58:24] because he SAID, "NO MAN HAS ASCENDED UP
[1:58:26] TO HEAVEN, BUT HE THAT CAME DOWN FROM
[1:58:28] HEAVEN, EVEN THE SON OF MAN WHICH is in
[1:58:31] heaven."
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; He said, "Right now, I haven't left
[1:58:36] heaven."
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; Heaven is where I am.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; This is what he said. The son of man,
[1:58:45] which is
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; where?
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; In heaven.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; So, you see, EVEN IN THE INCARNATION, I
[1:58:52] I WANT TO GET SOMETHING TO YOU. HEAVEN
[1:58:54] IS NOT LIMITED BY GEOGRAPHY.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; GOD'S PRESENCE IS NOT DIVIDED BY HIS
[1:59:02] MOVEMENT.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HEAVEN IS NOT EMPTY WHEN GOD COMES
[1:59:06] DOWN. HEAVEN IS JUST SIMPLY EXPANDING
[1:59:09] ITSELF TO THE EARTH FOR redemption
[1:59:12] purposes. Amen.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; As I preached a couple of sermons here
[1:59:17] some years ago of the day that heaven
[1:59:20] opens because heaven will open and
[1:59:23] expand itself. It's the expansion of
[1:59:25] redemption.
[1:59:27] So let us have understanding now.
[1:59:30] Heaven is not silent.
[1:59:34] Worship has never ceased.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; The seventh seal silence was just God
[1:59:39] restraining and holding back revelation.
[1:59:41] It was not absence.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; The thunders always had voices. They
[1:59:45] were just simply sealed up.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD COMING DOWN IS NEVER emptied
[1:59:50] heaven.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; Somebody with me.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT MEN MISTAKE IS SILENCE IS OFTEN
[1:59:56] GOD WITHHOLDING EXPLANATION. He's not
[1:59:59] withdrawing his presence. AND WHEN GOD
[2:00:01] CHOSE TO SPEAK AGAIN, WHEN THE TIME WAS
[2:00:05] RIGHT, THE SILENCE WAS BROKE, THE
[2:00:08] THUNDERS uttered their voices, AND THE
[2:00:10] DIVINE ORDER IS ONCE AGAIN DECLARED.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; And I tell you, when when when
[2:00:17] THE SEVENTH SEAL IS OPEN, AND IT IS.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; AND IT IS.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'S BRINGING AGAIN DIVINE ORDER.
[2:00:28] HEAVEN'S ORDER IS TAKING over what man
[2:00:32] calls order, which is chaos.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; And I want you to know when God brings
[2:00:38] this order, it's not chaos. It's perfect
[2:00:41] time to order governed by God alone.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; I marvel at this
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; because men try to make things happen.
[2:00:52] I want you to know every move of God
[2:00:54] that's ever been
[2:00:56] has been divinely orchestrated by God.
[2:00:59] It was never caused by man.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; Man didn't pray it down. Man didn't fast
[2:01:04] it down. Man didn't shout it down.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; Man didn't scream it down.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; Man didn't educate himself until he come
[2:01:12] down. HE DIDN'T DO IT BY INTELLECTUAL
[2:01:15] PROCESS.
[2:01:20] Somebody help me preach now.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Every move of God has been that way.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; And you know, now Pentecost 1906,
[2:01:31] 2026.
[2:01:33] Now we're what 120 years or so away from
[2:01:37] the Zuza movement
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; and Pentecost. THE PEOPLE, THE
[2:01:41] CHARISMATICS, ALL OF THEM HAVE TRIED IN
[2:01:44] VAIN TO FAST, TO FAST, TO PRAY, TO MOVE,
[2:01:47] to get something TO HAPPEN, TO TO MAKE
[2:01:50] GOD MOVE.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; THEY'VE FASTED. THEY'VE PRAYED. THEY'VE
[2:01:56] HELD REVIVAL. THEY THEY THEY'VE WORKED
[2:01:58] UP THEMSELVES. THEY THEY'VE TRIED TO
[2:02:00] SHOUT IT DOWN. THEY TRY TO FADE IT OUT.
[2:02:02] THEY'VE DONE EVERYTHING TO TRY TO MAKE
[2:02:04] IT HAPPEN.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN GOD MOVES, IT'S SOVEREIGN.
[2:02:09] AMEN.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; AND I TELL YOU, IT'S GOVERNED BY GOD
[2:02:13] ALONE. BUT I TELL YOU, GOD HAS DECLARED
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; THERE WILL BE A FINAL SWEEP IN THIS LAST
[2:02:18] DAY.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; AND HIS WORD IS STAND SURE AND WE KNOW
[2:02:24] THAT. AMEN. WHERE THAT WE WILL BE
[2:02:27] CHANGED IN A MOMENT, IN A TWINKLING of
[2:02:30] an eye, AND THE GREATEST DIVINE HEALING
[2:02:33] CAMPAIGN THAT'S EVER BEEN WILL STRIKE
[2:02:35] THE earth
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; and men and women will be turned back to
[2:02:39] youth again.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; This is not fiction.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; This is when God will step into our
[2:02:46] chaos
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; and bring order again.
[2:02:52] But in heaven, angels cry, "Holy, holy,
[2:02:55] holy," and they do it without ceasing.
[2:02:59] Creation is in constant utterance. As
[2:03:02] Psalms 19:2 says, "Day unto day utter
[2:03:05] speech, and night unto night showeth
[2:03:09] knowledge.
[2:03:11] Heaven is speaking."
[2:03:13] The stillness that God calls for is not
[2:03:16] the silence of praise.
[2:03:19] But it's the stillness of human
[2:03:22] reasoning,
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; human striving and self-order.
[2:03:28] When it says, "Be still and know that
[2:03:31] I'm God," it it's quietening the
[2:03:33] thoughts of man.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; It is quietening his opinion. It's
[2:03:39] silencing his fears.
[2:03:41] It's it's IT IS SETTING UP ALL OF THE
[2:03:44] METHODS AND THE SOLUTIONS THAT HE'S
[2:03:47] FIGURED OUT
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; SO THAT THE DIVINE ORDER OF GOD CAN BE
[2:03:51] RECOGNIZED, TRUSTED, and obeyed.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; He's telling you literally when HE SAYS,
[2:03:57] "BE STILL, AND KNOW THAT I AM GOD." He's
[2:04:00] telling you to shut up.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; NOT SHUT UP PRAISE.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; NOT SHUT UP WORSHIP,
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; BUT STOP YOUR HUMAN REASONING.
[2:04:11] QUIT TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; QUIT TRYING TO FIX YOUR PROBLEMS.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; QUIT. STOP RIGHT NOW. BE STILL AND KNOW
[2:04:22] I AM GOD.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; I AM IN CONTROL.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; That's God's message to you this
[2:04:31] morning.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; You've been trying to figure it out how
[2:04:34] it's going to be. My loved one will come
[2:04:36] in. I WILL BE WILL FIX MY PROBLEM ON MY
[2:04:39] FAMILY, my marriage, MY SITUATION, MY
[2:04:43] PROBLEM, MY HEALTH,
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; MY FINANCES, ALL KINDS OF THINGS. YOU
[2:04:48] YOU TROUBLED IN THE NIGHT AND KEEPING
[2:04:50] YOU UP AT NIGHT. BE STILL.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; QUIT TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; QUIT TRYING TO BE GOD. GIVE IT OVER IN
[2:04:57] HIS HANDS.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; He's the one in control.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; No, I am God.
[2:05:06] The Hebrew sense to that word means
[2:05:11] stop striving.
[2:05:14] Let go.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; Relax
[2:05:18] re release and relax your grip.
[2:05:23] In other words,
[2:05:25] when he says be still,
[2:05:28] he is actually telling you quit trying
[2:05:31] to be God.
[2:05:34] Do
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; you know that psalm? I don't know if
[2:05:41] you've ever thought of it when he right
[2:05:44] in the middle of it when he says, "Be
[2:05:45] still and know that I'm God." It's not a
[2:05:48] calm psalm at all.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; It's violent.
[2:05:52] Oh no. Nations are raging. Kingdoms are
[2:05:55] moved. The earth is shaking. Waters are
[2:05:58] roaring.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; Mountains are trembling. And right in
[2:06:01] the middle OF THAT CHAOS,
[2:06:04] God says, "Be still."
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; That's powerful.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; That's really powerful.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; He's saying in the midst of the shaking,
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; in the midst OF THE CONFUSION, STOP, BE
[2:06:19] STILL,
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; RECOGNIZE.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; I'm in control.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT IS PSALMS 46 AND 7, THE LORD
[2:06:28] OF HOSTS IS WITH US. THE GOD OF JACOB IS
[2:06:31] OUR REFUGE.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; Be still
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; and know that I am God.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; In other words,
[2:06:40] let every man's thoughts become silent
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; and know
[2:06:46] and know God in his divine order.
[2:06:50] Isaiah said it this way. This is Isaiah
[2:06:53] 55 and8. For my thoughts are not your
[2:06:57] thoughts,
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; neither are your ways my ways,
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; saith the Lord.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; When God says, "Be still," what he's
[2:07:06] telling you is to surrender,
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; to surrender your thoughts to his
[2:07:11] wisdom.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; It's when your human logic can step
[2:07:16] aside and divine order take command.
[2:07:20] And Jesus would illustrate this when he
[2:07:22] when he stepped and stood in that raging
[2:07:25] storm and the sea was LOUD AND IT WAS
[2:07:28] VIOLENT. It was chaotic.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; AND YET HE WAS ASLEEP IN THE BOAT.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN HE ROSE, I WANT YOU TO KNOW HE
[2:07:37] DIDN'T HE DIDN'T OUTSHOUT THE STORM.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; HE SIMPLY SPOKE WITH AUTHORITY.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "PEACE BE STILL."
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; That word MEANS BE MUZZLED. HE SILENCED
[2:07:50] THE CHAOS.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T DO IT BY PANIC, EXCITEMENT. HE
[2:07:55] DID IT BY HEADSHIP.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; Then he asked his disciples, "Why are
[2:07:59] you so fearful? Don't you have any
[2:08:02] faith?"
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; You know, the storm wasn't the problem.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; Their unsettled thoughts was the
[2:08:09] problem.
[2:08:11] And I want you to know, even in the
[2:08:14] chaos that you're in,
[2:08:18] the thoughts are the problem.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; Your unsettled thoughts,
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; not the storm.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; Cuz I don't care how big the waves are.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; And I don't care how noisy the wind
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; and the bolts of lightnings and the
[2:08:36] thunder. I don't care how terrible it
[2:08:39] seems AND HOW CHAOTIC IT IS.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF YOU CAN JUST LET YOUR FAITH
[2:08:44] SPEAK.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEN THAT STORM HAS TO CEASE.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE TRUE STILLNESS IS
[2:08:54] ALIGNMENT. IT'S NOT INACTIVITY. BECAUSE
[2:08:56] THE BIBLE SAID, "THOU WILL KEEP HIM IN
[2:08:59] PERFECT PEACE WHOSE MIND IS STAYED on
[2:09:02] thee."
[2:09:05] Notice the mind is still but faith is
[2:09:07] active.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; Worship continues. Praise flows but it
[2:09:12] flows from revelation
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; not confusion.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; From submission, not striving.
[2:09:20] You know,
[2:09:23] I've seen it sometimes where shouting is
[2:09:26] Yeah. It's kind of letting off emotion.
[2:09:28] It makes you feel good just to scream it
[2:09:31] all out.
[2:09:34] But let me tell you, that's not that's
[2:09:36] not worship.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; That's release of emotion.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Worship is giving praise to
[2:09:44] almighty God. It's not releasing some
[2:09:46] pinup feeling.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; It's surrendering your feelings and your
[2:09:50] thoughts to God.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; Notice here, faith is active. Praise
[2:09:55] continues. Oh, worship flows. It flows
[2:09:58] from revelation, not confusion. It comes
[2:10:01] from submission, NOT STRIVING.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; LIKE PAUL SAID, "LET EVERYTHING BE DONE
[2:10:06] IN decency and in order."
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Do you know?
[2:10:13] Do you know that chapter
[2:10:15] where that's quoted from 1 Corinthians
[2:10:18] 14:40?
[2:10:20] Do you know it's full of tongues and
[2:10:22] prophecy and worship and vocal
[2:10:25] expression and and and yet God calls it
[2:10:28] order. Amen.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; He does. Why? Because it's governed by
[2:10:33] the spirit, not the flesh.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; God's order does not suppress life. It
[2:10:38] directs it.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; So be still doesn't mean do nothing.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; IT MEANS KNOW THAT HE IS GOD.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; Know that he rules. KNOW THAT HIS WORD
[2:10:49] WILL HOLD EVERYTHING TOGETHER FOR you in
[2:10:51] YOUR LIFE.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; KNOW THAT WHEN YOUR HUMAN WISDOM AND
[2:10:55] YOUR HUMAN THOUGHTS AND YOU'RE TRYING TO
[2:10:56] FIGURE IT OUT, SHUT UP.
[2:10:59] THEN DIVINE wisdom can speak clearly.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; And when your voice
[2:11:05] subsides, God's eternal order becomes
[2:11:08] unmistakable.
[2:11:10] And that's stillness.
[2:11:13] Not silence without life, but life that
[2:11:15] is governed in by revelation.
[2:11:18] So like I said, Paul's Paul is talking
[2:11:22] about God's order when he says, "Let all
[2:11:24] things be done in decency and in order."
[2:11:28] And do you know
[2:11:31] people get it all wrong?
[2:11:33] They think that statement is a rebuke
[2:11:38] of of spiritual life. It is not.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; It's not a rebuke of spiritual life.
[2:11:43] It's the correction of spiritual
[2:11:45] disorder. Amen.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; Is it this very chapter that Paul speaks
[2:11:50] of order is OVERFLOWING WITH TONGUES AND
[2:11:54] prophecy and revelation, interpretation,
[2:11:56] prayer, vocal worship.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; And this is important. God did NOT CALL
[2:12:01] SILENCE ORDER. HE CALLED SPIRIT GOVERNED
[2:12:04] EXPRESSION ORDER.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; HE NEVER SHUT DOWN THE MOVE OF THE HOLY
[2:12:09] GHOST.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; In fact, he warned THE CHURCH AGAINST
[2:12:13] DOING EXACTLY THAT. 1 THESSALONIANS 5:19
[2:12:16] SAYS, "QUENCH NOT THE SPIRIT.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; DESPISE NOT PROPHESYING."
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; UH-HUH.
[2:12:27] So instead of suppressing suppressing
[2:12:30] spiritual manifestation, he was
[2:12:32] protecting them,
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; bringing them back into divine harmony.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; You see, there was a problem in Corinth.
[2:12:40] And the problem in Corinth was not that
[2:12:42] they had too much spirit. That's right.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; It wasn't THAT THEY HAD TOO MUCH HOLY
[2:12:46] GHOST.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; It was too much self.
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; You know, EAGERNESS FOR MANIFESTATIONS,
[2:12:53] COMPETITION FOR VISIBILITY, DESIRE FOR
[2:12:57] POSITION had taken what was holy and and
[2:13:02] it made it chaotic.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; SO PAUL DIDN'T SAY, "QUIT SPEAKING. STOP
[2:13:08] SPEAKING." NO, he didn't. Let's look at
[2:13:11] it. 1 Corinthians 14:27, he said, "Let
[2:13:14] it be by course.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; Did you hang up on me?"
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; Well, let me dial again. Operator.
[2:13:25] Operator.
[2:13:27] Yeah, I'm old enough to have a rotary
[2:13:28] dial.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; Somebody out there hung up.
[2:13:36] He did not stop
[2:13:38] the spirit.
[2:13:40] He did not cage the gifts.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let it be by course."
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Stop prophesying."
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; He said, instead in verse 29, "Let the
[2:13:54] prophet speak two or three and let the
[2:13:57] other judge."
[2:13:59] I'm telling you, he didn't remove
[2:14:01] liberty.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; He was restoring headship.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; The spirit was moving, but there were
[2:14:08] men running ahead of him. Yeah.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; And whenever MAN RUNS OUTRUNS GOD,
[2:14:12] THERE'S CONFUSION THAT FOLLOWS.
[2:14:14] REMEMBER, WHERE HE MOVES, YOU MOVE.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND AND PAUL REMINDED THEM, YOU
[2:14:20] KNOW, THE SPIRITS OF THE PROPHETS ARE
[2:14:22] SUBJECT TO THE PROPHETS. IN OTHER WORDS,
[2:14:24] THE HOLY GHOST DOES NOT OR OVERRIDE
[2:14:26] DIVINE ORDER. He operates within it.
[2:14:28] Why? Because God is not the author of
[2:14:30] confusion.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; But appease in all the churches of the
[2:14:34] saints.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; So he wasn't trying to repress it. He
[2:14:39] was trying to align it.
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; He tuned the instruments of the church
[2:14:43] so the symphony of God could be heard
[2:14:45] clearly
[2:14:47] because why? When every voice tries to
[2:14:50] lead,
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; noise replaces music.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; But whenever member moves in their
[2:14:57] APPOINTED PLACE, THE BODY CAN FUNCTION
[2:15:00] in harmony.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; For the body is not one member but many.
[2:15:06] So we have to work together in unity.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit never creates chaos.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; Fleshly ambition does that.
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; Paul restored the balance SO THE FLOW OF
[2:15:18] THE SPIRIT COULD CONTINUE WITH WITHOUT
[2:15:20] INTERRUPTION. ORDER DID NOT STOP
[2:15:22] REVIVAL.
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; IT SUSTAINED IT.
[2:15:26] AND LET ME JUST SAY THIS, CHURCH ORDER
[2:15:29] was never intended to be a law.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; But a pattern,
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; an example of how to conduct a service
[2:15:40] in a way that allows the spirit to move
[2:15:42] freely.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; Carnly cornly minded men, however, they
[2:15:46] they like to turn patterns into rigid
[2:15:50] legislation. And when that happens, the
[2:15:53] spirit the the service is no longer
[2:15:55] spirit
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; it it's rule driven
[2:16:01] and they end up killing the life of the
[2:16:03] service by clinging to the letter
[2:16:05] instead of allowing the spirit to give
[2:16:07] it life.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; And when divine order is restored,
[2:16:10] liberty increases, revelation becomes
[2:16:14] more real, more sharpened, and worship
[2:16:17] becomes edifying rather than confusing.
[2:16:20] And that's WHY THAT'S WHAT PAUL COULD
[2:16:22] SAY IN THE MIDST OF ALL SAYING ALL THIS.
[2:16:24] HE SAYS, "I THANK MY GOD I speak in
[2:16:27] tongues more than you all."
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Forbid not speaking in
[2:16:32] tonesues."
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; But rather that you prophesy
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; because it's better to understand than
[2:16:38] to speak in a language than nobody
[2:16:40] understand.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; Because when you're praying in the
[2:16:43] spirit in an unknown tongues, you are
[2:16:46] praying uh you're praying to God and
[2:16:48] nobody understands. and no one is
[2:16:50] edified. But when one prophesies,
[2:16:52] he reveals the secrets of the heart.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; So God's order is not to CAGE OR TO STOP
[2:16:59] THE SPIRIT'S MANIFESTATION. IT IS RATHER
[2:17:01] TO CHANNEL THE SPIRIT. IT DOESN'T QUENCH
[2:17:04] THE FIRE. IT GIVES THE THE FIRE A PLACE
[2:17:07] LIKE A HEARTH TO BURN.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; You you see there it can burn steadily.
[2:17:12] It can give give light to to everything
[2:17:15] WHEN WHEN GOD is and the spirit is
[2:17:18] HONORED AND THE FLESH IS SUBDUED AND
[2:17:20] HEAVEN AND EARTH once move once more can
[2:17:22] move in harmony together.
[2:17:28] I'm running out of time.
[2:17:31] I didn't make any vows.
[2:17:34] I made no New Year's resolutions.
[2:17:39] I'm not breaking anything.
[2:17:43] So,
[2:17:46] I hope you'll resolve to listen to the
[2:17:48] end.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; Heaven once moved in perfect harmony.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; Every being knew its place.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; Every voice knew its part.
[2:18:05] ALL WORSHIP FLOWED IN ONE DIRECTION
[2:18:08] toward God alone. There was no puffed up
[2:18:11] men.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; There was no great angels
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; exalting themselves. There was no
[2:18:17] competition. There was no ambition.
[2:18:18] There was no disorder.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; The stars of God shone in their
[2:18:23] appointed orbits.
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; Heaven's order was sustained by joyful
[2:18:28] submission to the will of a most holy
[2:18:30] God.
[2:18:33] But Lucifer,
[2:18:36] Lucifer desired another order.
[2:18:40] It would be an order centered on
[2:18:42] himself.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; And the scripture pulls back the veil
[2:18:47] and lets us see what was right in his
[2:18:50] heart. For in Isaiah 14:13 says of him,
[2:18:53] "Thou has said in thine heart.
[2:18:57] I will ascend into heaven. I will exalt
[2:18:59] my throne above the stars of God. I WILL
[2:19:02] SIT UPON THE MOUNT of the congregation
[2:19:04] in the sides of the north. I will be
[2:19:07] like the most high.
[2:19:12] Notice
[2:19:13] this is where rebellion began. This is
[2:19:16] where chaos began.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; We showed you where God was bringing
[2:19:21] order and brought everything in order.
[2:19:24] Now let's look at C
[2:19:27] rebellion.
[2:19:28] And it was not first in action. It was
[2:19:30] in his heart.
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; Do you know that's where sin begins?
[2:19:37] Long before people leave the message
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; physically,
[2:19:44] they leave it in their heart
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; first.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; Rebellion began in his heart.
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; Now, Satan didn't want to abolish
[2:19:59] worship.
[2:20:00] He wanted to redirect it.
[2:20:04] And he reasoned HIMSELF THAT ALL OF THIS
[2:20:07] GLORY AND all of this praise should not
[2:20:10] belong to God alone. I too will be
[2:20:12] worshiped. I will have a throne.
[2:20:16] So he says in verse 13, I will sit also
[2:20:21] upon the mount of the congregation. Look
[2:20:24] now the congregation,
[2:20:27] the church
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; in the sides of the north. Psalms 48:2
[2:20:35] tells us of Mount Zion, the city of the
[2:20:38] great king in the sides of the north. HE
[2:20:41] SAYS, "I WANT God's place."
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; And this is THE SOURCE OF ALL SIN.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; WHEN MAN EXALTS HIS WILL, ABOVE GOD'S
[2:20:55] WILL.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; And Luther's ambition was clear. I'm
[2:21:04] going to take God's place. I'll sit
[2:21:06] where only God belongs. I'll rule in the
[2:21:08] hearts of worshippers. And this was not
[2:21:11] just merely rebellion. It was a
[2:21:13] spiritual coup. It was an attempt to
[2:21:16] replace divine headship with
[2:21:18] selfexaltation. And this is exactly how
[2:21:21] what happens when when when you when you
[2:21:24] when you move out into sin. What is it?
[2:21:26] It is you accepting it accepting
[2:21:30] selfexaltation
[2:21:31] your will above God's word.
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; And it's a spiritual coup. It's it's an
[2:21:37] overthrowing of of THE WILL OF GOD FOR
[2:21:40] YOUR LIFE. And this has ALWAYS BEEN
[2:21:42] SATAN'S STRATEGY. He does not he doesn't
[2:21:45] just openly oppose the message.
[2:21:48] No, he corrupts it.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. He He He doesn't just TRY TO STOP
[2:21:55] THE GENUINE MOVES OF GOD. HE TRIES TO
[2:21:58] ENTER IN THEM.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; HE TRIES TO DILUTE THEM
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; TO redirect them
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; and eventually institutionalize them.
[2:22:09] Amen.
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; Now, scripture warns us very clearly in
[2:22:14] 2 Corinthians 11:14 that Satan himself
[2:22:17] is transformed into an angel of light.
[2:22:22] And his danger is an obvious then. It's
[2:22:25] not obvious evil. It's counterfeit
[2:22:29] light.
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; And from the beginning, Satan has never
[2:22:34] said don't worship.
[2:22:38] Instead, he says, "Worship,
[2:22:40] but not exactly the way God said."
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; And this was his tactic in Eden. You
[2:22:47] know, he comes and he says, "Yay hath
[2:22:49] God said." You see, he didn't deny the
[2:22:51] word outright.
[2:22:53] &gt;&gt; How many times in brother Brandon go
[2:22:54] over this for us?
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; It was questioned. It was adjusted. It
[2:22:58] was misinterpreted.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; And the SAME METH METHOD HAS FOLLOWED
[2:23:04] EVERY GENUINE move of God. IN LUTHER'S
[2:23:07] DAY, GOD RESTORED THE TRUTH OF
[2:23:10] JUSTIFICATION BY faith
[2:23:12] and light. IT IT IT DAWNED AFTER AND
[2:23:17] BROKE THROUGH the through centuries of
[2:23:19] darkness.
[2:23:21] But Satan quickly moved IN TO HARDEN THE
[2:23:24] THAT revelation and the creeds into the
[2:23:26] systems of man. And what began as a
[2:23:29] living faith gradually became dead
[2:23:32] orthodoxy.
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; That's right. and the truth they had
[2:23:40] preserved.
[2:23:42] Oh yeah, they held on to that, but they
[2:23:45] lost the life of it.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; I want you to know they still quoted
[2:23:50] Luther
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; and and his recordings,
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; but the light had left.
[2:24:05] You say, "Well, we have today the voice
[2:24:07] of God recordings." Listen, this is not
[2:24:09] the only day the voice of God has been
[2:24:11] recorded.
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; The voice of of God has been recorded
[2:24:16] since Genesis.
[2:24:19] &gt;&gt; Paul recorded his voice, the voice of
[2:24:23] God, left it for generations to come.
[2:24:27] He he said it was to be read in all the
[2:24:30] assemblies.
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; That everybody should hear what Paul
[2:24:35] said
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; should be read in all the s assemblies.
[2:24:40] The recording of God should be read in
[2:24:42] all assembly. But he didn't replace
[2:24:44] ministry with it.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; What's the pattern?
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; Watch what real men of God do. They
[2:24:54] recognize God's voice.
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. It certainly is in recordings.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THIS IS GOD'S VOICE ON PAPER.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; And we also have A MESSAGE IN THIS LAST
[2:25:09] DAY WHERE that we CAN HEAR WHAT GOD SAID
[2:25:12] TO A GENERATION.
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD STILL SPEAKS THROUGH THE
[2:25:17] MINISTRY.
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE'S SPEAKING TODAY FROM THE
[2:25:21] PULPIT.
[2:25:23] HE'S MINISTERING TO HEARTS TODAY. HE'S
[2:25:25] TRYING TO BRING HE'S TRYING TO BRING
[2:25:27] ORDER
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; TO YOUR CHAOS.
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; Light into your darkness.
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; But you see,
[2:25:37] it wasn't long till they did what Paul
[2:25:39] said. They fell from grace, not by sin,
[2:25:42] but returning to systems. In Wesley's
[2:25:45] day, God restored to holiness and
[2:25:47] sanctification.
[2:25:49] And there were hearts that were set on
[2:25:51] fire. lives were changed. You know,
[2:25:54] there was order brought out of into
[2:25:56] lives of men and women who were in
[2:25:58] chaos.
[2:26:00] But Satan moved in. And it wasn't
[2:26:03] persecution. And they had persecution.
[2:26:07] It wasn't persecution that destroyed it.
[2:26:10] IT WAS WHAT DESTROYED THAT MOVE OF GOD
[2:26:12] WAS FORMALIZING IT.
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; The experience BECAME A DOCTRINE.
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; THE DOCTRINE became a requirement. And
[2:26:21] the FIRE COOLED TO A structure
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; and what was meant to cleanse the heart
[2:26:25] became a measured standard instead of a
[2:26:28] living work of the Holy Ghost.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; And at Isuza Street,
[2:26:34] it happened again.
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; God restored the baptism of the Holy
[2:26:38] Ghost and the gifts of the spirit.
[2:26:42] And there was humility, repentance,
[2:26:45] unity, power.
[2:26:47] But Satan entered in again. Remember, he
[2:26:49] don't stop it. He just enters in.
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; He gets right in it through pride,
[2:26:55] through racial division, through
[2:26:56] personality cults,
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; through denominational controls. And
[2:27:01] what began as unity would be fractured
[2:27:03] into organizations.
[2:27:05] And Paul warned again, having begun in
[2:27:07] the spirit, are you now made perfect by
[2:27:10] the flesh?
[2:27:12] And today,
[2:27:14] today the same spirit is at work.
[2:27:18] When God is calling for full
[2:27:19] restoration, for continuity with the
[2:27:22] word of God, once again, Satan is not
[2:27:25] trying to stop it. HE'S JUST TRYING TO
[2:27:28] MANAGE IT.
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; HE PUSHES PLATFORMS INSTEAD OF PRESENCE.
[2:27:33] AND PLATFORMS ARE BUILT BY MEN.
[2:27:35] PLATFORMS THAT HAVE AN AGENDA. PLATFORMS
[2:27:37] THAT DOMINATE. THAT MAKES HEADQUARTERS
[2:27:39] FOR CONTROLS THAT REGULATE. Platforms
[2:27:43] that remove the spirit and diminishes
[2:27:45] diminishes the power and tries to
[2:27:46] control the flow.
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; But presence is given by God.
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; And nothing, let me tell you, nothing
[2:27:55] can replace the cloud of glory.
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; Nothing. Amen.
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you church, we can have all
[2:28:02] the structure we want. We can have the
[2:28:04] finest music. We can have the greatest
[2:28:06] singing. We can have ordered SERVICE. WE
[2:28:08] CAN HAVE RITUAL after ritual. But if we
[2:28:10] lose the spirit, we've lost everything.
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; Because it's only when the spirit of God
[2:28:21] moves,
[2:28:23] &gt;&gt; the chaos is brought into order.
[2:28:27] I'm going to have to leave some of this
[2:28:29] for another time. I don't know if I'll
[2:28:31] pick this up again,
[2:28:33] but I'd like just a moment
[2:28:36] just to take a couple examples as I
[2:28:38] bring this down to a close
[2:28:41] this this morning.
[2:28:44] And I I want you to think
[2:28:47] of how God does this,
[2:28:50] how that God moves and how he bring
[2:28:53] things out of chaos and bring it into
[2:28:57] order.
[2:28:58] And if I can just find the place there
[2:29:01] that I can just bring it to you today
[2:29:04] where you can you can see clearly what
[2:29:06] we're talking about
[2:29:08] because you know there are there were
[2:29:10] times that Jesus
[2:29:13] would come to bring order into people's
[2:29:17] lives.
[2:29:19] And fact of the matter is
[2:29:21] GOD WOULD COME DOWN INTO CHAOS.
[2:29:25] And I COULD TALK ABOUT THE CHAOS of the
[2:29:28] Sadducees and the chaos of the Pharisees
[2:29:30] and the chaos of the Roman GOVERNMENT
[2:29:32] AND THE CHAOS that Israel was in.
[2:29:36] AND HEAVEN WOULD EXPAND ITSELF FOR THE
[2:29:38] PURPOSE of redemption. And God would
[2:29:41] step down in the chaos
[2:29:44] because he's coming now
[2:29:48] not to save an organization.
[2:29:50] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; HE WOULD NOT COME TO RE TO reform the
[2:29:54] Pharisees.
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; NEITHER WOULD HE COME TO TRY TO
[2:29:58] STRAIGHTEN OUT THE SADDUCEES.
[2:30:01] But he WAS LOOKING FOR HIS OWN.
[2:30:05] &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY. HE WAS LOOKING FOR
[2:30:08] his people,
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; THOSE THAT WERE IN HIS THOUGHTS, THOSE
[2:30:11] THAT WAS IN HIS MIND. And there HE WAS
[2:30:15] NOT HE WAS NOT PREACHING ORDER, HE WAS
[2:30:18] ORDER INCARNATE.
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; AND HERE HE WAS WALKING UPON THE EARTH.
[2:30:23] And when he WALKS INTO THE EARTH, THIS
[2:30:26] ONE STEPS RIGHT INTO THE chaos of a
[2:30:29] woman that is at the well.
[2:30:33] AND THIS WOMAN, HER LIFE IS EMPTY. IT IS
[2:30:37] VOID. It is without form. And there is
[2:30:41] darkness covered the deep places of her
[2:30:44] soul.
[2:30:46] Oh, the winds and the ravages OF SATAN
[2:30:49] BLEW ACROSS IT. MIGHTY STORMS WAS THERE.
[2:30:52] A TROUBLED MIND, A TROUBLED HEART, a
[2:30:55] troubled life.
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; Sin had taken her further than what she
[2:30:59] would ever want to go.
[2:31:01] It had done things she had never
[2:31:03] intended to.
[2:31:05] &gt;&gt; It had taken a girl that was started out
[2:31:07] pure and a virgin and defiled her in so
[2:31:10] many ways. She was so now unclean
[2:31:15] until
[2:31:17] she couldn't even fit into even what men
[2:31:20] called order.
[2:31:31] Yet, exactly when God moved the first
[2:31:34] time,
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; there was seeds that had been planted
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; that had to come to manifestation.
[2:31:44] &gt;&gt; And for that to happen, THE SPIRIT OF
[2:31:46] GOD would have to move.
[2:31:49] &gt;&gt; And when THE SPIRIT OF GOD WOULD MOVE,
[2:31:50] IT WOULD SAY, "LET THERE BE LIGHT."
[2:31:53] AND SEEDS THAT WERE THERE UNDER THE
[2:31:55] WATER NOW WOULD COME UP AND HERE THERE
[2:31:57] WOULD BE AND THERE WOULD BE LIFE COME
[2:31:59] INTO THE WATERS AND THEN THE THE THE THE
[2:32:02] MOUNTAINS and the and THE THE THE LAND
[2:32:05] FORM AND AND NOW ON THE LAND seeds had
[2:32:08] been planted AND NOW AS THE LIGHT BEGAN
[2:32:10] TO DAWN AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVED. HE
[2:32:12] WOULD COME UP ONE PLAN after another
[2:32:14] after another after another until he
[2:32:16] finally comes to a man that would be in
[2:32:19] his image that would be God breathed.
[2:32:24] &gt;&gt; Now God's wanting to do the same
[2:32:27] because his pattern never changes.
[2:32:30] And he steps down
[2:32:33] into chaos.
[2:32:36] Cuz hidden beneath that brokenness
[2:32:40] of that woman at the well
[2:32:44] was a seed fornown of God.
[2:32:48] &gt;&gt; It had been placed there before the
[2:32:51] foundation of the world.
[2:32:55] AND THE BIBLE SAID HE HAD NEED
[2:32:58] TO GO BY SAMARIA.
[2:33:03] &gt;&gt; Oh my, THINK OF THAT. GOD had a need.
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[2:33:06] &gt;&gt; OH, YOU THINK YOU THINK THE WOMAN HAD A
[2:33:09] NEED? AND SHE DID.
[2:33:12] &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS MORE THAN A WOMAN HAVING A
[2:33:14] NEED. IT WAS A GOD THAT WAS CALLING OUT
[2:33:17] FOR A FAMILY.
[2:33:19] &gt;&gt; I NEED A DAUGHTER. I MUST FIND THIS ONE
[2:33:23] THAT IS LOST.
[2:33:27] &gt;&gt; And I DIDN'T COME TO CALL THE RIGHTEOUS
[2:33:29] TO REPENTANCE. I COME TO SEEK AND SAVE
[2:33:33] THAT WHICH WAS LOST.
[2:33:38] &gt;&gt; MAN HAD MADE THEIR RIGHTEOUSNESS. THEY
[2:33:40] HAD THEIR RELIGION. THEY HAD THEIR POP.
[2:33:43] THEY HAD THEIR CELEBRITIES.
[2:33:46] They had their holiness.
[2:33:50] But God bypassed all of that,
[2:33:53] &gt;&gt; looking for beyond man's righteousness,
[2:33:58] &gt;&gt; cuz he wasn't going to call them to
[2:34:00] repentance, but he was looking for lost
[2:34:03] ones.
[2:34:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE CREATION
[2:34:10] BACK THERE, IT LOOKED LIKE A LOST
[2:34:12] CREATION. A CREATION LOST. YEAH.
[2:34:18] &gt;&gt; A creation in turmoil,
[2:34:22] &gt;&gt; a creation in chaos.
[2:34:26] And that was this woman,
[2:34:33] all that time,
[2:34:36] her life was ruled by chaos.
[2:34:41] But in her soul was a seed.
[2:34:45] AND THAT SEED WAS CRYING FOR EXPRESSION.
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH.
[2:34:52] &gt;&gt; I THINK ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW, GOD HAD A
[2:34:54] DESIRE. REMEMBER GOD, IT IS HIS WILL TO
[2:34:58] SAVE. IT HIS WILL TO HEAL. IT HIS WILL
[2:35:01] TO DELIVER. IT IS HIS WILL TO BRING
[2:35:03] ORDER.
[2:35:05] &gt;&gt; Here's a woman
[2:35:08] and she has a seed and is crying for
[2:35:11] expression.
[2:35:13] It is cried for expression and tried to
[2:35:15] find it in her husband.
[2:35:18] And that man deceived her and let her
[2:35:20] down. And she took another and she took
[2:35:22] another and she went from man to man to
[2:35:24] man to man. All the reason because she
[2:35:28] had a seed
[2:35:30] crying
[2:35:32] for expression.
[2:35:35] But chaos
[2:35:37] was over the face of the deep.
[2:35:41] Sin had his hold
[2:35:46] and the winds of Satan blew at night.
[2:35:49] There was no peace.
[2:35:53] She cried out to God. She searched for
[2:35:55] him. She even tried different religions.
[2:36:00] She became religious.
[2:36:02] She could quote the scripture
[2:36:05] &gt;&gt; cuz she was reaching for satisfaction.
[2:36:08] Like some of you, you went from church
[2:36:10] to church to church to church
[2:36:13] cuz you were a seed crying for
[2:36:14] expression.
[2:36:17] &gt;&gt; And in her chaos, she had religion,
[2:36:21] but religion wasn't going to help her.
[2:36:24] &gt;&gt; Religion just made her more miserable,
[2:36:27] &gt;&gt; self-righteous.
[2:36:30] And here the MESSIAH IS STANDING RIGHT
[2:36:32] BEFORE her and she has her profession
[2:36:35] and she says, "Our fathers worshiped in
[2:36:38] this mountain." And you say that in
[2:36:40] Jerusalem is a place where men ought to
[2:36:43] worship.
[2:36:45] And she knew forms.
[2:36:48] She knew locations. She knew arguments.
[2:36:51] &gt;&gt; She knew the arguments of the Pharisees
[2:36:53] and the arguments of the Jews and the
[2:36:55] arguments of of THE UH THE SAMARITANS.
[2:36:58] AND THEY SAID, "WE WORSHIP HERE AND WE
[2:37:00] WORSHIP THERE AND SHE'S TORN THIS WAY.
[2:37:02] IT'S TORN THAT WAY." AND SHE DON'T KNOW
[2:37:04] WHAT TO BELIEVE.
[2:37:06] &gt;&gt; And Jesus
[2:37:10] saw that she knew all kinds of religion,
[2:37:12] but she didn't know peace.
[2:37:16] &gt;&gt; And he redirect redirected her form from
[2:37:19] religious confusion, from that chaos to
[2:37:22] divine order. And he said,
[2:37:25] "The hour cometh, and now is
[2:37:28] when the true worshipper shall worship
[2:37:30] the Father in spirit and in truth.
[2:37:33] &gt;&gt; For the Father seeketh such to worship
[2:37:36] him."
[2:37:40] &gt;&gt; This is the order God seeks.
[2:37:44] And then he touched the root of her
[2:37:47] chaos
[2:37:49] and said, "Here's the root of your
[2:37:51] chaos.
[2:37:53] is all contained in a threeletter word s
[2:37:57] i n
[2:38:01] and he exposed it.
[2:38:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:04] &gt;&gt; You've had five husbands
[2:38:06] and the one you're living with is not
[2:38:08] your husband.
[2:38:12] What was happening?
[2:38:15] TELL ME WHAT WAS TAKING place
[2:38:19] again. IT WAS A GENESIS.
[2:38:22] &gt;&gt; It was a beginning.
[2:38:25] &gt;&gt; It was a beginning for this WOMAN AT THE
[2:38:27] WELL. SHE SHE HAD NEVER HAD A BEGINNING.
[2:38:32] &gt;&gt; All her life had ever been was an end.
[2:38:36] &gt;&gt; It was evil. It was ruined. It was
[2:38:39] wrecked.
[2:38:42] But the same one that has stood there in
[2:38:45] the portals between heaven and earth and
[2:38:48] looked over chaotic earth, look now upon
[2:38:51] a chaotic woman whose nature is all
[2:38:54] disturbed that is blown by Satan by
[2:38:58] every wind and every thought and every
[2:39:00] EVERYTHING EVER CHASING THIS, CHASING
[2:39:02] THAT PLEASURE, CHASING THIS, CHASING
[2:39:04] THAT AND NOTHING SATISFIES. AND ALL THE
[2:39:07] REASON WHY WAS BECAUSE THERE WAS A SEED
[2:39:09] inside calling
[2:39:11] &gt;&gt; for expression.
[2:39:13] &gt;&gt; And the one who had created the seed now
[2:39:16] was passing by her way cuz he had a need
[2:39:18] to pass by Samaria.
[2:39:22] &gt;&gt; And the ONE THAT IN THE BEGINNING SAID,
[2:39:24] "LET THERE BE LIGHT." HE SAID AGAIN,
[2:39:27] "LET THERE BE LIGHT." AND LIKE DAWNED IT
[2:39:31] &gt;&gt; AND IT QUICKENED THE PREDESTINATED SEED.
[2:39:34] AND HER SEED JUMPED TO LIFE.
[2:39:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND SAID, "COME SEE A MAN
[2:39:39] WHO HAD TOLD ME ALL THE THINGS THAT I'VE
[2:39:41] DONE. ISN'T THIS THE VERY MESSIAH?" SHE
[2:39:44] RECOGNIZE him as the Christ.
[2:39:48] &gt;&gt; Because why? When light comes
[2:39:52] from he who stops the chaos.
[2:39:56] When light dawns on the soul from the
[2:39:58] word being released,
[2:40:01] the chaos stops
[2:40:03] and peace begins.
[2:40:08] Her seed was crying.
[2:40:12] There's another one.
[2:40:16] He's standing
[2:40:18] way across the sea.
[2:40:24] His life is in shambles.
[2:40:27] His home has been wrecked.
[2:40:30] His marriage is gone.
[2:40:33] His children despising afraid of him.
[2:40:37] His fellow men have drove him out.
[2:40:41] Only place he can find is a tomb.
[2:40:47] He's haunted.
[2:40:50] He's tormented.
[2:40:52] One sin,
[2:40:55] that first sin
[2:40:57] invited one devil in.
[2:41:00] That one invited another.
[2:41:03] &gt;&gt; That one invited another.
[2:41:06] That one invited another.
[2:41:09] &gt;&gt; Until there were so many
[2:41:12] there were legions.
[2:41:16] And now his identity
[2:41:20] is with the demon powers.
[2:41:23] &gt;&gt; My name, my identity is legion. I'm a
[2:41:28] wrecked soul. I'm a ruined person.
[2:41:32] Nobody wants me. I'm an outcast.
[2:41:36] I've been chained and they tried TO
[2:41:39] CONTROL ME WITH MEN'S RULES. THEY PUT ME
[2:41:42] IN JAILS. THEY HAVE TRIED TO REFORM ME.
[2:41:45] I BROKE THE CHAINS, BUT I REPEAT IT ALL
[2:41:49] AGAIN.
[2:41:50] &gt;&gt; I GO BACK TO THE TOMBS.
[2:41:52] &gt;&gt; IT'S A CYCLE I CAN NEVER GET OUT OF.
[2:41:57] &gt;&gt; And in a moment,
[2:42:00] that seed in him cried for expression.
[2:42:07] And there was one
[2:42:10] that heard it
[2:42:12] &gt;&gt; when he whispered a prayer just in that
[2:42:15] moment.
[2:42:17] &gt;&gt; Jesus or God, help me
[2:42:22] &gt;&gt; somehow. Help me.
[2:42:24] &gt;&gt; And then the demons take him again and
[2:42:27] he's out of his mind, raging, anger,
[2:42:32] frustrated,
[2:42:34] terrorized,
[2:42:35] tormented.
[2:42:37] destroyed
[2:42:39] &gt;&gt; cuz that's what sin does.
[2:42:44] &gt;&gt; It holds you captive, holds you bound.
[2:42:48] It takes you down into chaos.
[2:42:52] &gt;&gt; I know the world will call it pleasure.
[2:42:55] The world will call it order,
[2:42:58] but it's chaos
[2:43:03] because sin has control.
[2:43:06] And Satan has a headship.
[2:43:13] He didn't know it, but across the sea,
[2:43:18] God had stepped into flesh.
[2:43:24] &gt;&gt; And he heard his voice
[2:43:28] &gt;&gt; and he says, "We must leave this meeting
[2:43:33] &gt;&gt; and GO TO THE OTHER SIDE."
[2:43:39] AND YOU WOULD THINK THAT WITH JESUS
[2:43:42] GOING TO THE OTHER SIDE, IT WOULD STOP
[2:43:44] ALL THE CHAOS. NO, THE CHAOS GOT WORSE.
[2:43:49] &gt;&gt; Satan began to disturb nature itself.
[2:43:52] AND NOW BEGIN THE WAVES BEGIN TO ROAR.
[2:43:56] YOU KNOW, THE VIOLENCE INCREASED. THE
[2:43:58] HORRIBLE THINGS BEGIN TO HAPPEN OVER AND
[2:44:00] OVER AND OVER AND AGAIN TO TRY to keep
[2:44:03] Jesus
[2:44:08] from getting to a seed.
[2:44:12] But this God can't be stopped.
[2:44:15] &gt;&gt; He's more powerful than all the legions
[2:44:18] of hell.
[2:44:20] &gt;&gt; He's the one who said in the beginning,
[2:44:22] "Let there be light." And there was
[2:44:24] light. And now he steps into the boat
[2:44:28] &gt;&gt; and from there steps into land. And he's
[2:44:31] not coming to be defeated.
[2:44:34] &gt;&gt; He's walking with a purpose. He's
[2:44:37] looking into a tomb. He's looking to
[2:44:40] find a soul that is darkened, that is
[2:44:43] tormented, that is wretched, that is
[2:44:46] miserable,
[2:44:48] &gt;&gt; THAT IS CRYING, THAT JUST SAID THAT
[2:44:51] LITTLE ONE MOMENT, God
[2:44:54] somehow help me.
[2:45:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, I wish Jesus was here.
[2:45:06] &gt;&gt; He's come all the way from glory.
[2:45:08] He's here in the form of his Holy
[2:45:10] Spirit.
[2:45:11] &gt;&gt; He steps into the flesh of a man. He
[2:45:14] wakes him up in the middle of the night.
[2:45:16] He tells him to preach a sermon to bring
[2:45:19] order out of chaos
[2:45:21] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE'S A SEED crying
[2:45:25] &gt;&gt; for expression
[2:45:27] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD HAS A NEED TO GO BY YOUR WAY
[2:45:31] &gt;&gt; TO INTERRUPT THE DEVIL'S PLAN
[2:45:34] &gt;&gt; TO INTERRUPT WHAT HE WOULD DESTROY AND
[2:45:37] HE WOULD RUIN AND TO BRING ORDER INTO
[2:45:41] YOUR CHAOS.
[2:45:46] He's here this morning to do that very
[2:45:48] thing.
[2:45:49] &gt;&gt; To bring your life into order
[2:45:52] &gt;&gt; and to bring it out of that chaos
[2:45:54] &gt;&gt; of sin that you've been in
[2:45:56] &gt;&gt; and to loose the bonds and make you a
[2:45:59] free man or woman to worship God.
[2:46:03] &gt;&gt; I want you to bow your heads with me
[2:46:08] because the same one
[2:46:11] that said, "Let there be light." And he
[2:46:12] rolled up the planets, the stars from of
[2:46:15] his hands,
[2:46:17] formed them in the palm of his hands.
[2:46:19] That's saying, "God is here this
[2:46:22] morning."
[2:46:23] And he's revealing himself in human
[2:46:25] flesh,
[2:46:27] speaking to you this morning a divine
[2:46:29] message
[2:46:31] to bring order in your chaos.
[2:46:39] I've considered it in these last few
[2:46:42] days and I told brother Timothy maybe
[2:46:45] told some of the ministers
[2:46:48] God is making his last call
[2:46:51] but he says
[2:46:53] my wedding supper will be filled.
[2:46:57] He's sent out calls. Men and women have
[2:46:59] made two many excuses.
[2:47:02] I married a wife.
[2:47:06] I bought a yoke of oxen.
[2:47:14] I bought a piece of land and got to go
[2:47:16] see it.
[2:47:18] Made excuses.
[2:47:21] Life,
[2:47:22] the busyiness of life
[2:47:28] to where they had no time
[2:47:31] to come to his supper.
[2:47:35] How long will you continue to make
[2:47:37] excuses?
[2:47:52] Your excuses
[2:47:54] doesn't cause God any sympathy.
[2:47:57] The Bible said and the king was angry.
[2:48:01] He said, "But my supper will be filled."
[2:48:05] So he starts a divine healing campaign
[2:48:07] and he sends out
[2:48:09] says bring in the halt, the ma, the halt
[2:48:12] and blind, the lame.
[2:48:16] No matter how crippled, how deformed,
[2:48:18] how wretched, how miserable, bring them
[2:48:20] in.
[2:48:23] And they come back and said, "Yet
[2:48:24] there's still room." He said, "Well,
[2:48:25] then go out to the highways and the
[2:48:27] byways.
[2:48:29] Compel them all. Come in.
[2:48:35] I think of that day when the prodical
[2:48:38] son came home.
[2:48:41] He was a son,
[2:48:44] but he was in chaos.
[2:48:47] He ate with the pigs, but he was always
[2:48:50] a son.
[2:48:53] He sold all his inheritance,
[2:48:57] but he was always a son.
[2:49:04] The new birth is not where you become a
[2:49:06] son. The new birth is when you realize
[2:49:08] who your the source of your life is. who
[2:49:11] father is
[2:49:13] where you realize your sunship.
[2:49:32] When the prodal came,
[2:49:37] the father was looking for him.
[2:49:40] He'd been waiting for this moment.
[2:49:43] He'd never give up.
[2:49:45] You know, preachers might give up on
[2:49:47] you. Parents might give up on you.
[2:49:50] School teachers might say, "Ah, there's
[2:49:52] never a hope for that boy, that girl.
[2:49:55] Their life is too much in shambles."
[2:49:59] Society may give up on you, but God
[2:50:02] never gives up.
[2:50:06] He's looking for you,
[2:50:09] but you got to make a step.
[2:50:15] The Bible said, "Draw nigh to God. He'll
[2:50:17] draw nigh to you."
[2:50:20] And I'm inviting you today
[2:50:25] if you're in chaos
[2:50:30] for you to allow the Holy Spirit to come
[2:50:31] and change your life.
[2:50:41] The altar is open.
[2:50:43] The invitation is there.
[2:50:47] He wants to bring some order
[2:50:50] to your chaos.
[2:50:55] God bless you. He sees you. He sees your
[2:50:57] heart. Sincere before God. Would there
[2:51:00] be another?
[2:51:02] Some of you reached out to me last
[2:51:03] night. Brother Tim, I need to speak with
[2:51:05] you. God just spoke to you.
[2:51:08] Why don't you let him deal with you
[2:51:09] right now?
[2:51:14] Say, I feel the pull today. I want a new
[2:51:19] beginning
[2:51:20] today. I won't send nature dead in my
[2:51:23] life today. I don't want to be
[2:51:27] possessed by all of those legions or add
[2:51:30] another devil to my life this year. I
[2:51:33] want to be free. I want the monkey off
[2:51:36] my back. I don't want to serve sin any
[2:51:39] longer.
[2:51:49] Let him move right now in your life. If
[2:51:52] you can feel a pull,
[2:51:54] if you can feel him touch,
[2:51:57] he steps out
[2:52:00] to bring order into your chaos.
[2:52:04] As I sing it, you come.
[2:52:09] I feel the pull.
[2:52:14] I hear
[2:52:17] the call.
[2:52:21] The spirit bids come now
[2:52:28] &gt;&gt; say I'd like to give my life to Christ.
[2:52:29] I'd really like to consecrate it.
[2:52:33] &gt;&gt; I really want to be really surrendered.
[2:52:37] &gt;&gt; I want peace
[2:52:40] in my life.
[2:52:42] &gt;&gt; I want
[2:52:44] joy. I've never known joy.
[2:52:47] It would be horrible to say you was
[2:52:49] always in this life and you never knew
[2:52:51] peace.
[2:52:54] &gt;&gt; But he's the prince that brings peace.
[2:52:59] &gt;&gt; He invites you right now. The spirit
[2:53:02] bids come.
[2:53:03] &gt;&gt; I feel the
[2:53:05] &gt;&gt; I feel the
[2:53:09] Yes. I hear
[2:53:10] &gt;&gt; I hear the
[2:53:13] &gt;&gt; Can't you hear him calling you?
[2:53:15] Is there deep calling to the deep?
[2:53:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is there something there you want
[2:53:21] to just consecrate
[2:53:24] and dedicate?
[2:53:27] &gt;&gt; Is there some little bit of chaos there
[2:53:30] that you want settled this morning?
[2:53:33] &gt;&gt; Do you want him to move in your life?
[2:53:39] &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, I agree.
[2:53:42] Yes, Lord. I'm going to agree with you
[2:53:44] with your word.
[2:53:46] &gt;&gt; Please come take control.
[2:53:50] I feel the
[2:53:57] I come to hear the word
[2:54:02] and with
[2:54:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54:10] &gt;&gt; What is he doing?
[2:54:12] He's calling me to give. What about it?
[2:54:18] &gt;&gt; A higher praise.
[2:54:22] &gt;&gt; What is it now? There's a day
[2:54:27] called to the day
[2:54:30] like a great flag.
[2:54:37] I know for sure
[2:54:40] I reach the door
[2:54:43] where I feel the Just talk it over with
[2:54:46] him right now.
[2:54:49] Amen. I feel good.
[2:54:53] Amen. I can be right there in your seat.
[2:54:56] Amen. I don't have to be up here, but
[2:54:58] wherever it is,
[2:55:01] &gt;&gt; let him come and step into your chaos.
[2:55:06] Let the light dawn within your soul,
[2:55:08] within your being.
[2:55:10] &gt;&gt; The joy of the Lord be yours.
[2:55:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, I
[2:55:18] he speaks to me.
[2:55:22] &gt;&gt; And I
[2:55:25] agree.
[2:55:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Lord reach
[2:55:32] and take control.
[2:55:36] I feel the cold.
[2:55:40] Last night I lay in bed.
[2:55:43] &gt;&gt; At night I lay in bed
[2:55:47] and I be to cry.
[2:55:54] &gt;&gt; Here he's speaking.
[2:55:56] &gt;&gt; I'm not afraid.
[2:55:59] I'm going to bring
[2:56:02] Glory
[2:56:04] &gt;&gt; into chaos, out of chaos.
[2:56:07] I'm going to bring them back
[2:56:10] like they were in my mind before the
[2:56:12] beginning. Before Shan ever took them.
[2:56:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:56:22] &gt;&gt; It must be God.
[2:56:26] is my soul for I feel the home.
[2:56:31] Amen. Maybe some other people want to
[2:56:33] come around and pray with these at the
[2:56:35] altar right now. Maybe you see a friend
[2:56:37] there. Maybe you see a brother. Maybe
[2:56:39] you see a sister. You'd like to come
[2:56:41] right now.
[2:56:44] &gt;&gt; This is divine order. Amen. The Bible
[2:56:48] said we call on the name of the Lord,
[2:56:49] we'll be saved.
[2:56:52] Maybe there's somebody right now. You
[2:56:53] want to just consecrate your life again
[2:56:55] to God. You you want to surrender,
[2:56:57] dedicate yourself a new. You You want a
[2:57:00] fresh anointing.
[2:57:02] Amen. You want a greater order of the

[2:57:10] over you this morning. Amen. To breathe

[3:03:35] renewed,
[3:03:37] flowing from the grave
[3:03:42] that I found
[3:03:45] in you.
[3:03:53] And Lord, I've come to know
[3:03:58] the weaknesses I see
[3:04:02] in me
