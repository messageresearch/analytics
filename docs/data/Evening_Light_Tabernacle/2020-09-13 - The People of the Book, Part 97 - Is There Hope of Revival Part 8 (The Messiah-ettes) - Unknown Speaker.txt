we're thankful to the lord for his goodness his grace his mercies that endure to every generation even to right now amen i spoke with brother ron spencer on the way and uh to church today his his mother-in-law sister fraser she's a she's the widow of brother homer fraser a long-time pastor that went to be with the lord here some time ago a few years ago now and and she got really deathly ill with this kobet was rushed to the hospital she had a wonderful night last night amen so we thank the lord for answering prayer and as i was talking to brother ron you know he also come down with the covet and they he's having some pneumonia in his lungs he's got two more days of quarantine i think um monday he'll be out of quarantine and so he had a good night's sleep last night but he went to the hospital and they um had taken uh some pictures of his lungs and the doctor came back out really smiling and he said you know you know it's something when you go and you're you see a positive report of pneumonia in the lungs but you come out smiling because the cancer is the tumors is all gone and i only see just threads of it as it's leaving hallelujah hallelujah amen well we can have good news even in the time of cobit can't wait i mind that god is still on the throne and he's moving for his people amen how wonder wonderful word of god we're going to be speaking on the messiahs this morning i trust that it'll be a blessing to you as we look into the word and i am i am going to um read two scriptures today and it's going to be one from acts chapter 10 verse 38 and we have been reading how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power who went on about doing good and healing all that was oppressed of the devil for god was with him amen and then john 14 12 we will read it in the 13th verse john 14 12 verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also in greater works than these shall he do because i go unto my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son amen god bless you you may be seated last week we spoke on the messiah and the messiahs and we were speaking along of christ being the anointed one and and as we were speaking that you know peter received that great revelation from god that said thou art the christ the son of the living god or you're the anointed one the christ that's what that means and um and so and that is what the church is built upon is that he is the christ the son of the living god and then he said but and i say unto you that thou art peter so you see as it turns that after the revelation of christ then he tells you who you are amen and this this is a whole thing that the church is built upon is really a true revelation of who jesus is amen that he's not no he's not some a second person of the godhead or some third person or he's not even a minor lord under lord he is the lord god almighty amen the lord jesus christ and any message any church any movement any religion must be built upon the revelation of the thought to christ thou art the anointed one and if the messiah if the anointing isn't there get away from it amen you say well while my group has got a superior revelation but if the anointing isn't there is just a dead form it cannot be a true message without the anointing you cannot be a true christian without the anointing any church without mark 16 an action cannot be the true church of god without his anointing the church is dead it is powerless it is a facade that has the outward appearance of being the bride of christ but inside is full of empty promises puts me in mind to these cover girls beautiful on the outside but do you ever think they want to be a mother do you think they want to be have a baby nursing on her stretch marks on that bewitching enchanting body to her to that kind of woman this is a disgrace but and as brother branham would say and we have echoed it so often think of it today a disgrace for her to have a child she can't be bothered with the baby nursing her it'll just form her when she's impregnated it'll just form her she won't look like she used to again and can you imagine they don't want him today and neither do they want his children and and and of course that's what brother branham told us uh in the invisible union he says neither does the modern church want any of these screaming shouting tongues speak in acts 2 38 youngins around her hey man see yeah she don't want any of them whooping and crying and screaming amen hallelujah well a child like that would put her out of her denomination they had one like that in one of the churches why they throw her out right quick why are you letting such stuff as that go as this go along and and you think sometimes that is only describing maybe a denominational move but you you wouldn't you know you don't think they would do that no not in the message church but i just spoke to a brother this week you know who was kicked out of an assembly for believing the supernatural working of the spirit of god and desiring and longing to see a move of god in his in their midst you see as as it is you said she's impregnated with something because she's bringing forth members all the time but she don't want any of these screaming holler and blabbered acts 238 miserable creatures that she thinks they are why it would embarrass her it would ruin her and her educated ethical scientific society that she belonged to here they would throw her out at the next council amen it's amazing it's amazing that now jesus with dirty feet is sitting in many messy churches today we don't want that kind of case here don't you dare treat my jesus that way amen you welcome him you invite him you wash his feet amen you put the the garment upon him you perform you you perfume him with oil and let the sweetness of it just fill with its aroma fill the place amen and you give him a service amen so she don't want to be pregnant with the word because that's the only kind the word can bring forth born of the spirit of god it has the spirit of god in it no intellectual church joined creed going bob-haired painted face there's no such a thing as that in it at all you don't find that in the word of god you find the old fashioned sanctified holy ghost-filled child born of the spirit of god screaming and hollering and shouting and praising god is there any of them here today there ought to be those kind in this myth today amen old-fashioned sanctified holy ghost field born of the spirit of god screaming and hollering and shouting and praising god that's what ought to be in every message church that truly believes the word of god because that's the only kind the word can bring forth if the church brings forth the child of the second adam he acts like the second adam's way of acting like they did on the day of pentecost all of these things were said by your prophet amen but because the church refuses a spirit she is a barren church she may look like a sex queen she's beautiful on the outside but she has a womb in which the seed never comes to life because she destroys the anointing but the bride receives his life she wants his anointing and she she is bringing forth children of the anointing amen his bride is deity amen she's a messiah because it's the spirit of jesus that is in us that makes us sons of god you see the devil is trying to hide you back and tell you that you're some little downtrodden something but you're not you're sons and daughters of god and brother brandon said they did it isn't just in heaven it is on earth it's in his people amen in question answer 64 the word messiah means the anointed one now if you have the holy spirit then you become the anointed one how many's got the holy ghost you are anointed not only the anointed you are the anointed one no wonder we have turned a message though into a weak and powerless gospel when we question as i was speaking last sunday when we questioned the deity of jesus christ and when we don't recognize them the power that is in us and paul said if any man have not the spirit of christ amen he is none of his right now you know you can't have jesus in you because jesus is a man a corporal body sits on the throne of god but you can have his spirit in you amen so it is the spirit of jesus that is in us so if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his amen again and anyone who is his then god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying never father amen his the spirit of his son has been sent into you that's what the holy ghost is the spirit of jesus a mountain and when his spirit entered to you then it's like he says in galatians 4 7 lord no more a servant but a son and if a son an heir of god through christ john 1 16 says and others fullness have we received grace for grace amen grace upon grace god has given favor upon favor grace upon grace until he pours out his fullness and this is the age of where it's no longer the portion it's the age of his fullness are you with me and man we'll read some quotes from christ's mystery a little later about it but this is the day where the fullness of the godhead is in a body amen just as it was in christ now it's in his body upon the earth in the message perfect faith brother branham said this he he appeared to us in the same form that he appeared that he did to them in the old testament and in the same as he did in the new testament and his shame showed by the same word the same christ and i've declared to you that christ is the holy ghost the word christ means the anointed one just the person that's anointed that's that's the christ the anointed one how many knows that's true the anointed one that there would be a man that would be an anoint would be anointed anointed with what the bible said in acts 10 that jesus of nazareth was a man approved of god anointed with the holy ghost went about and done great works and things see that god manifested and proved that he was in that man and now we become anointed with that same spirit anointed messiahs messiahs of the last days to shine forth the resurrection of jesus christ to show he's not dead but in the form of the holy ghost he's in his people moving among his pride with a love affair to her pouring out into her himself amen and they are becoming one for the wedding supper and the same signs promised by the same god in the same word is making the same manifestation oh hallelujah and he adds he said there's nothing left for us to do but believe it amen and he said and to believe it is the substance and that creates a perfect faith and he said just think how numb we are just think of that just for a minute and i hear him in in desperations talk about it and he says oh church rise and shake yourselves and pinch your conscience and wake yourself up in this hour we must be desperate or perish i don't know if you've noticed or not but we have been we have moved into a very serious time amen there are things that are moving in our midst and things that are changing and our the whole environment is changing around us the whole the whole political arena the whole thought of of of peace and safety things are changing riots and looting in our streets anarchy trouble on every hand and not only that but you know we that's almost the rest of what is going on is almost downplayed by what is happening in our streets but there you have nations rising up flexing their their muscles during this time whether it's china or russia or north korea or or iran or all of them with threats to destroy us all do you realize where we're at amen so he says rise and shake yourself pitch your conscience wake yourself up in this hour he said there's coming forth something from the lord amen i know it is tough saith the lord there's coming forth something and we better get desperate it's between life and death and it'll pass through us and we won't see it and i don't know about you but i don't want to be in some slumber and stupor and miss it i want to see and know exactly what god's doing as i told you when this covet struck early in january february i said you you can see everybody's afraid of this death that's coming into the land and moving through the nations but there's somebody else at work you never see the enemy rise without you seeing a standard rise against it amen are you with me amen you never you never see even the the bottomless pit open without also seeing and that's in revelation 9 we're also seeing a mighty angel putting his foot on it come on placing his feet on the land in the sea are you with me amen you know as as he concludes the night chapter with all of the the evil the devil's rising up out of hell all the evil that is going on the sin and the trouble and the wickedness and and the idolatry as it ends and he and he's talking about and he says he says i see him the bottomless pit open and then the angel is given permission to open it and we conclude the ninth chapter and it opens with the tenth and it says and and there's a conjunction it ties to what was said before with this and i saw another mighty angel i wonder if you're seeing the mighty angel i wonder if you see there's an anointing come down i want you i wonder if you realize that there is somebody in this day of hour receiving that anointing just as the other are receiving the sodomite spirit and the idolatry that's going on in the lamb of course as i said jesus the man the corporal body is not here nor is he within us but the spirit of jesus the anointing is in us this anointing is not external it doesn't come and go it abides forever are you with me it is within us and we must arouse and stir up the gift of god that is within us is that right you know they here here again this is what he tells pete uh timothy he said you know we have not received the spirit of timidity you know we we have not received a spirit of fear of drawing back and shining away hiding in a corner there's no need to we're we're not children that are that are that are immature we're adopted sons we know who we are we have our position amen we we know we're robed with the holy ghost that there's a power within us somebody help me preach amen oh my there again he said arise and and stir up that gift to god that is within you that was there he tells timothy it was darren your grandmother lawyers and it was in your mother eunice but it's also in me you see it was there in the shouting methodists who fainted under the power of god where they actually kept water uh to to throw in their faces but that power sanctified them not the water remember the anointing amen brother bradley said they had meetings where they were kicked out and was called holy rollers you methodists was done that they fall in the water under the power of god they throw water in your face and fandom that's right and they jerked so hard under it till they they had the jerks and there was people who would jerk and shake under the power of god hallelujah you see it was there in your grandmother amen it was there in the past movements it was there on azusa street where they spoke in genuine tongues not a shake a jaw until you stammered something insensible but real tongues amen that healed the sick as the spirit was poured out amen amen that faith was there in the divine healing movements can't we say amen to that amen and i'm convinced that it's also in you hello and i'm convinced it's also in you i'm convinced it's also in you i'm convinced it's also in you come on it's a spirit of faith it's not a spirit of fear it's not a spirit of drawing back it's not a spirit of hiding in the corner it's a it's not a spirit of intent timidity amen i'm being shy and embarrassed about it it's a faith that is rising up it is there in the other moves but it's also there in you in fact it's not a lesser anointing it's a greater anointing lois couldn't preach eunice couldn't preach but timothy could it was even a greater anointing stir it up you got to start using it and the message adoption brother branham said he gave jesus christ and jesus gave it in his name with this assurance asked the father anything in my name and i'll do it waiting for the manifestations of the sons of god to position the church as i said the book of ephesians the book of joshua and joshua placing the people where they belong now they wouldn't stand still he put he from here and he said he ran over to manassas land and this and would come back fussing and stewing and how are they ever going to get along well one said i'm i'm a baptist i'm a methodist i'm a pentecostal i'm one there's some trueness i'm so and so how are you going to do it stand still and i think all of this deal of you know everybody jockeying for position and place and whatever it should be over now all the all the ones trying to be spiritual like brother braden said trying to jumping up and down and trying to speak in tongues is over with come on jumping up and down like a kid trying to speak with dungeons over with am i we're past that and man we're not trying to recreate that amen we're not trying to recreate an emotional workup we're not trying to recreate a sensation amen or do you know where you're where you where somebody beats you on the back to you yeah and get you to jabber until you speak in an insensible words we're not trying we're beyond that we received the perfect word and when that which is perfect has come that which is in part is done away with so instead of having part we now have it all [Music] this anointing we have received grace for grace grace upon grace poured out in luther poured out in wesley poured out in pentecost poured out now and of his fullness we have received god is wanting to place his church sons and daughters of god god let me live to see it that's my prayer so close till i can just feel it in my hands almost look like it's it's right there is what i long to see waiting for the time when walked down the street there lays a laying there from his mother's womb

than that wheelchair do you hear that kenneth man greater is he that is in you that's that stretcher do you hear that one in the hospital right there listening to me amen greater is he that is in you than that cancer do you hear all of those cancer patients that i've been praying for and i've had to make a list and lay on my table for all of the needs that have come down and and because it gets so many that human memory cannot bring them all a man greater is he that is in you that that cancer greater is he that is in you than that affliction amen now that covers a lot amen greater is he that is wait a minute not greater is he that's in this church not just greater is he that's in tim pruitt amen but greater is he that is in you don't miss it in you than he that's in the world amen greater is he that is in you than that cancer that affliction that stretcher that wheelchair greater is he yes greaters greater is he the greater was david what was in david god and david he is in us that's the christ he was the conqueror of every enemy for us when he was listen this one in me conquered sin death hell and the grave conquered every disease there ever was come on help me preach when jesus died at calvary amen he took with him in death every sickness and when he rose he rose without them hallelujah when he rose he defeated every every ailment ever trouble every sickness ever bruised ever with his trips he took it there and took it to hell with him and when he raised he raised without them the mighty conqueror [Applause] and come to set us free from all these things and greater is he that in you that is in you than all these bluffs in you because they're just bluffs but i heard a prophet say you are made of stuff that won't bluff that's a messiah they're made of stuff that won't bluff amen now greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world the messiah signs follows the messiahs the same as it followed the messiah remember jesus said we believe on him the works that i do shall you do also and greater i go to my father and if you ask anything in my name i will do it now we know it's going to take the anointing moses got anointed remember without the anointing he was just a shepherd ran from egypt after killing one didn't deliver the children of israel any made their bondage worse somebody helped me preach amen but here he gets down and he's on the backside of the desert and he's forgot all about it but god hasn't forgotten and sometimes we as humans forget but god don't god gave a word for this generation and god don't forget i mean sometimes we as humans grow cold and lukewarm and tepid to it come on but god don't i have heard their christ and i have come down to deliver them i like those words this is why i'm here this is why the anointing comes for deliverance not just to make you run the aisle but for deliverance why christ speak brother adam talks about moses having met the burning bush that the word was vindicated exactly it was the word moses didn't have to worry what's this voice all about what is this being here and i want you to know god sent an angel to this generation [Music] amen when god sent an angel to william branham he sent that angel to me is that right amen he sent it to me it was a message i'm sending you with a message of divine healing of deliverance amen that message never changed even when it came to mysteries that had had been hidden from the believers and and sealed away it didn't change i've come for deliverance to open the book to loose the seals can't you understand i've come down for a purpose i've come down for deliverance to reveal to you the mystery of your life your misunderstood ways amen why you can't fit in this world amen and why you got an attraction to the word i've come to tell you you were called before the foundational world before you were formed in your mother's womb i knew you and ordained you to be a messiah to this age god had said israel was so would so adjourn and be mistreated in a strange country until the iniquity of the amorites was filled remember those types very out very much the the last age because god said now you know sin has got to reach a certain height before i bring judgment and even with sodom he says i have come down to see if what i'm hearing is true now why why would god do that sometimes god speaks to man as a man so he said god already knew right but he comes right down he says i've come down i've come down and i'm investigating sodom i'm watching the riots in the streets amen i'm i'm seeing i'm seeing the evil that's in the land i'm seeing the lgbt movements and all the other sodomy movements and i'm seeing the anti-god with sentiments and i'm seeing america turn from a lamb to a dragon i'm watching it amen i see i see the beast rising but don't worry i got my foot on it i got my foot on it i put my foot on the land and the sea where both of these rise i got my foot on it [Applause] my church is still here my chosen people are still here my bride elect who is my body is still here and i put their feet on it [Applause] hallelujah and hell can't break loose until this bride goes up and when she goes up satan is cast down [Applause] and you're in a battle this morning you are in a battle of casting satan down but i read in the bible that he loses moses knew this intellectually the seed was born in him it was laying in his heart and he tried to intellectual experience with the word to try to deliver to israel because he knew he was born for that purpose he knew it was the time he knew the scripture said it already been 400 years and and and so he he knew all of that he knew things were laying in order but he needed the anointing and i'll tell you you know we we know that everything's laying in order but you're not gonna get through this without the anointing that's why we need the anointing more than ever your family needs to be anointed before they go out to school and hear all the anti-god evil things is being taught they need the anointing for our people go out to work we need the anointing upon them we need the anointing on our young men because satan has made women i'm quoting your prophet so beautiful too they're almost irresistible and there's a spirit you can say whether you want to or not there's a spirit of evil upon this land upon this country upon this world where the men are turned into beasts they're there's so many of them they can't arrest them all child trafficking worse than every child child beast because when men reject the seal of god they take the heart of the beast so brother brandon said we know we've lived the time out at the time of the rapture it is at hand and we're looking for a rapture in faith that can pull the church together and get some supernatural strength there to change these bodies that we live in when we see a god that can raise the dead off the floor out of the yard and bring him back to life again and present him before us and when we see god who can take cancer that's a to man to shadow and raise him up to a strong healthy man that ought to give rapture and faith to the people and then when that light flashes from the sky and the trumpet sounds the body of christ will be quickly gathered together and changed in a moment and then taken into the heavens yes there's got to be something like that happen oh my what you're seeing going on is exactly what your prophet preached old eagle is sterner nest he's letting things get uncomfortable he's fluttering over with his wings he's blowing out the loose feathers because there's a people getting ready to fly we are not called to be sitting ducks we are called to be flying eagles look at the anointing in the last day it's a flying eagle little children more about that later reminding you of this quote from the token i'm looking for a time of the break forth of the spirit of god in these last days that we're now living in for another surge of the holy spirit into the church for rapture and faith just before it comes and everything is sitting straight in order for that and three kinds of believers he said that's the reason i do believe that when the bride is called out and elected and said in the book of life there will come a sound from heaven that takes such a baptism of the holy ghost holy spirit into that bride that a taker from the earth in a rapturing grace the eagles are about ready to take their flight that's why the nest is being stripped you know the old eagle builds its nest out of thorns and thistles and weaves them in among the the old you know picking up twigs and branches and this and that and then he piles up his all his sticks and everything else but when he's about to lay her eggs she goes out there and gets some maybe some rabbit or lamb or whatever he can get get the softest fur put it out and lays it there so those little eagles that they have something that's soft and comfortable he makes it wonderful for his little hatchlings but when that little eagle gets gets up a little bit and begins to mature there comes another phase and it's nest leaving time and the mother knows that this eagle was not born to stay in a nest all its life it was meant to fly so you know what happens a mother goes and stirs over her nest and picks out all of the fleece and the and the rabbit fur and the down and everything else and throws it out and leaves a little eagle on the uncomfortable sticks and thorns and thistles and then they begin to say this ain't feeling like home anymore there's got to be a better place for me amen you know what happens they start getting ready to fly because that mother knows that that eagle can't stay in that nest and god knows you cannot just stay in a nest as immature babies but you're gonna have to fly in the heavenlies where all things are possible to them that believe and some of you this morning knows you've been taken on that flight and god has shown you wonderful things and all of a sudden you've been top you've been knocked off of the eagle's back and you're twisting and turning and whatever and you're screaming as to what's going on and what's happening and why is this happening and oh you know god why is it happening god said i'm trying to teach you to fly use those wings i gave you [Music] don't worry he ain't gonna let you hit the ground [Music] he's watching no just waiting to swoop down and catch you take you back up on the mountain and dump you off again how in the world are we going to learn to cast out devils if devils don't come and face us how in the world are we going to operate by of of casting out sickness if sickness doesn't come how can you have miracles unless calamities happen think it's not strange that these hard trials come on you they're done for a purpose i'm teaching you how to fly countdown brother branham would talk about this he says he said he's talking about the astronaut age he said i pray father they'll realize this isn't to condemn what they had is only trying to give them more rapture and grace that's what this message came it didn't come to take from you what you had he came to give you more amen rapture and grace for the hour will come when we'll have to have rapture power not only to heal the body but to change it in a moment in the twinkling of an eye christ will be so real unto their bodies till he can change it oh hallelujah you mean i can expect the greater reality of the holy ghost come on christ will be so real in their bodies your body ain't going to be changed from the outside in your body is going to be changed from the inside out if you ain't got nothing on the inside there's no change for you christ will be so real in his body told their body still he can change it by his great death what he purchased may they take this today that the token i spoke of last night hold it before them and and walk into this into this astronaut granite father where the visions and the powers and the worlds beyond and known and oh god where all these great mysteries has unfolded in those seven seals and made known to man granted father let me just say something to those heady high-minded bunch that say well glory to god brother tim you know you're over here in the in the in the airplane age or the car age or the whatever else but we're up here as astronauts well then words the great mysteries of god that are unfolded of those seven seals were visions and powers and worlds uh worlds beyond known amen maybe maybe you're just pretending i don't want to pretend you know when i was a little kid to put us in school and put us in a simulator of how to play an airplane or to drive an airplane you know i i was i was you know almost scared to get in the thing because i didn't know how to drive that thing and you're getting oh you don't pull that sliver do this and the instructor is doing and i'm trying oh you crashed shakily i got out there what a ride that's about like some of these churches today they're full of pretending they're pretending brother bradley is here praying over prayer cloths they're pretending that brother branham we're going to give you we're going to turn the service over to god's servants of prophet now pretending and they're also pretending they got the holy ghost because he ain't there and then they're pretending oh we got the seal of god no kobet's gonna get us and well what's that cough and what's that sneeze and what's that temperature and what's that what's that happening among you you're a false prophet now let me just tell you brother branham himself was subject to the flu when it came through amen he went around for the swine flu but he was around for what was it asian flu or hong kong flu or killed hundreds of thousands of people around the world and brother branham got it you see we're human pinch yourself and find out you're human you're real amen your body is subject to sickness the most spiritual ones of us but it's also subject to healing and deliverance and the power of god this ain't just a one-sided thing are you with me and he says he says again you know where he speaks in this he's talking about this body change that is coming because this is where it will crescendo now people listen the the the methodist movement ended with the dead sorry but it did this became a denomination the pentecostal movement ended with the dead sorry but it did you ain't gonna like this but the divine healing movement ended with a dud it did a dead thump everywhere no revival nowhere impersonations everywhere and it became cheap and carnal and everything else and the excitement was gone and the euphoria and then and even the anointing even the desire to pray and read it to you from the prophet that's the way it ended but that ain't the way this movement will end it's going to end in the change of the body in the meeting in the air let me read it the resurrection was set in first the resurrection of those that are asleep there will be awakening time and those that are asleep in the dust now not those that sleep in sin because they'll sleep right on they want to wait for another thousand years but those that are sleeping in the dust will be awakened first and these corruptable bodies will put on incorruption in the rapture and grace of the lord and then we'll all get together and when they begin together then we which are alive and remain shall be changed and then these mortal bodies will not see death but just all of a sudden there'll be like a sweep go over us and you're changed you're turned back like abraham was from an old man to a young man from an old woman to a young woman what's this sudden change and after a while you're traveling like a thought and you see those den that are already resurrected hallelujah amen we're not talking about a philip translation that gets picked up and set back over here on the earth again even though it did good come on amen but but no we're not talking about a philip translation we're talking about a rapture a real an enoch translation where you get so far with god you don't come back home with all the word the anointing just keeps getting greater and greater and greater not less and less and less are you with me it's enoch brother branham said no i may not have faith to make every word of it act but i certainly wouldn't stand in the way of anybody that did have that faith he had faith one day enough one day to take an afternoon stroll with god and just keep on walking and went up home without dying but now i think the church has got to come to that rapture in faith i may not have that faith just now but i wouldn't stand in the way of someone who did have that faith again he says and this is that was 64-65 i'd certainly like to have faith like that i hope that we do get that faith someday as we grow on in to him of this anointing we have received grace for grace as the prophecy brother joe expressed it again wednesday night and brought it back to the forefront as a prophecy was given to me a series of victories amen a series of victories you know i personally we we had a we had a we had a victory you should have been with me that day when my wife who they said would die in five minutes or five years but she'd never speak but when i stood beside her and i said karen do you hear me if you hear me you remember our little secret we've had it ever since we were children when when we were when we were just young children she was 17 when i married her i was 21 children we had a little something between us we'd hold hands no we didn't shake hands we'd hold hands and i would squeeze one two three i love you and she would squeeze back i love you or sometimes she would do it for i love you too we've done that all our married life and when i walked into that room and i took her hand i said karen i'm here do you hear me you remember our little secret and she goes one two three before she could even speak that was a victory hey man and then when she could speak amen when she could speak and she could call my name and she could she could speak up and say thank you jesus another victory hallelujah and when she walked thank you jesus another victory am i moving all limbs another victory a series of victory and when she came home another victory when she come to church another victory and she's going to have that victory over that anxiety this kind of the devil trying to tell her [Music] nothing can harm us not even death we're the sons and daughters of god amen come on a series of victories amen and and i'm not just leaving it there i'm leaving it right on bringing it right on to you a series of victories we've had victories after victories after victories and we could call them by name come on amen we could call them by name and say it over and over and over again but a series of victories and if i were you i'd get ready for my victory [Applause] i'm going to give you victory let your faith loose let it begin to grow let it begin to move and that's not just for even like tabernacles that's for around the world let your faith lose there's a series of victories on the way [Applause] it's a shame that message churches that we have moved away from faith and identified christ of all ages brother branham said by gift of god i want to identify i want jesus to identify himself to the word that i've just preached to show this is the hour the word is lotted to this hour that we pass the denominational ranks and we're fixing to go to the rapture just trying to get people faith to believe then he uses illustration like the pyramid on the back of your dollar bill you know how it moves up and then there's a capstone and he uses that he said that headstone will have to be so perfect like the rest of them until it would fit right straight into it the ministry of christ will be in his church just exactly like him in spirit when he comes to take the church to redeem the whole thing then goes up so again the church the minister of christ will be in his church remember we've got to fit him the capstone that's coming so there's got to be a ministry on earth in the bride that matches the christ that is coming so that the truth can be won it has to fit the bride is the anointed one this day she's not the less anointed she is the messiah for this day to be as bright she has to be anointed as he was anointed i hear brother branham saying it like this and what shall i do with jesus called christ the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy ghost i'm stopping right there just to say i'm so ready for my refilling i'm so ready for this church to have a refilling i'm so ready for this bride to have a refilling around the world in every church a fire lit yes amen you don't have to come the evening like tabernacle together you got to get into christ to get it amen i'm so ready for it the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy ghost there's a refilling promise for you how many he's got the holy ghost raise your hand amen there's a refilling promise for you and if you don't have it it's promised to for the promises to you and to your children to them that are thorough even as many as the lord our god shall call and i know he's still calling because we're still here amen amen when that he said the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy ghost that we've worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when the head and the body unites together the full power of the holy ghost would raise her up just exactly like that even the dead that's dead in christ for hundreds of years will rise in the beauty of his holiness and take a flight to disguise the dynamics is the holy spirit now you see because of the multitudes of miracles and the pinpoint miraculous sign of the messiah being displayed in his ministry do you know some people actually thought that brother branham was the messiah they actually taught him god they thought him jesus christ amen you see the identification of a messiah anointed one is signs and wonders and they saw it so perfectly in brother branham they thought him to be jesus so that's awful brother timmy it's his antichrist really but really it's also has to be in john the baptist's ministry come on amen because they ask him are you the christ so it has to be in the forerunner's ministry for people to think william branham was the christ you see you remember when john when men came from john and said john sent us said are you him or shall we look for another remember we went over that scripture last year and and he didn't say anything he just cured many of their infirmities and plagues and evil spirits and to the blind he gave sight and then he said go your way and tell john what you saw amen how that the blind see the lame walk the lepers are clean the devs here the dead's raised and the poor to the poor the gospel is priests because that's the sign of the most of an anointed one that is the sign of the anointed one i don't want you to miss that oh yeah that was a sign of jesus yeah it was but that's also the sign of his bride you know some maybe gas this morning so you mean to tell me people actually thought that william branham was god well yeah and to believe that is antichrist of course we know that but before you criticize william branham for something he not just denied but he openly detested i want to ask you a question when was the time you lived so close to god it was so much like jesus somebody mistook you for jesus somebody had the audacity to ask him must have been going around must have been talked about must have been in the congregation must have been when people were talking so brother branham and then he he said let me let me see what this is he reads it over and he starts reading again brother branham is commonly believed by many that follow your message that you are the messiah of this day is that soul now remember last week we have message believers who don't even believe that jesus is god this week we're talking for a moment about those who believe william branham is god you see it goes back to the where peter was they're missing the revelation of a new birth amen that they know who the christ is are you with me and he says first place i'm not a messiah jesus is messiah it must seem messiah is jesus christ but we are messiahettes every one of us messiah messiah means anointed one and in him dwells the fullness of the godhead bodily in me and you and me just dwells part of his spirit the same as dwells in you he said jesus had god without portion i only have god by portion because on the day of pentecost everybody that was there and everyone that's been born of god got a lick of that pillar of fire a tongue of that fire a lick of that fire a flame of that fire because the holy spirit divided himself that all that he was in jesus now there's 120 jesus my god the devil didn't know what to do with 120 jesus he thought he crucified him and he went back to heaven but now he doesn't know what to do with 120 jesus because now the spirit of god has divided itself and there's 120 and god ain't through because 3 000 are added when peter preaches amen because there's power in preaching he didn't play a tape he preached [Applause] somebody with me i mean he didn't idolize somebody preached the living christ and what he did 3 000 were added to the kingdom right then looks of fire 3 000 3120. he just kept dividing and satan said i don't know what i've done because i thought i got rid of jesus by crucifying him but now i have him now in a hundred and twenty bodies three thousand bodies three thousand one hundred and twenty body and it just keeps growing and now that jesus is in you and satan don't know what to do with you come on hallelujah because greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world [Applause] [Music] hallelujah i don't know about you but i'm having fun this morning amen because i can see it's christ in you the hope of glory it's not me that liveth paul said it's christ that liveth in me he'd do it the works jesus said see he said i've got a little gift to know little things and foresee things but that makes me just steal your brother i'm no messiah i'm not no messiah i'm your brother see just a shepherd to the flock and if i told you i was the messiah i'd be a liar see and i don't want to be a liar can you believe it like i said some people that if the devil couldn't get some to believe that jesus was not god then he got others believing that brother branham was god one side wants to take the deity away from jesus and the other was to give it to brother branham either way it was to strip the glory from the messiah understand what i'm saying amen now in question answers 3 64 brother branham said are you going to read the question brother branham could could jesus look like you or you be jesus or something like that he said one sense of the word that's exactly the truth in another sense of the word it is an antichrist that's the difference between right and wrong to make me the person of the lord jesus christ would be an antichrist for that person of the lord jesus is sitting at the right hand of the majesty on high and will come again in great power and glory but for his life that was in him being upon me and upon you who have them is exactly the truth and you become christ you remember my message of messiahs you are the word messiah means the anointed one and now you now you are if you have the holy spirit you become the anointed one do you have the holy ghost you're the anointed one do you have the holy ghost you're the anointed one do you have the holy ghost you're the anointed one are you with me amen if you have the holy ghost you become the anointed one that then there's all kinds of the anointed ones there's anointed ones and housewives there's anointed ones and mothers come on they lay hands upon their child rebuke the fever do it right now amen in your family in your home come on church there's anointed one you better there's all kinds of anointed ones there's jesus and many bodies amen and that body is not just an evening like tabernacle it spreads around the world that body can be found in elkton virginia in johnson city tennessee in cloverdale over in south africa down in the end hey you don't even have to belong to assembly to in order for it to to be in you got to belong to jesus somebody help me preach amen it's him it's him and the body and guess what it's not here in portion anymore you see what methodist only had a portion of him because he had a portion of the word which with a portion of the spirit that came with the word that was given a man a greater word came with pentecost they had a greater word and a greater portion amen come on bring it right on down right now in this age this time now it's not a portion anymore hallelujah now the fullness of the godhead bodily is now dwelling in a body you see david parsley had him and moses partially had him they did great works and did signs and wonders elijah had him in poison somebody helped me preach but when jesus came he was moses elijah he was jeremiah he was ezekiel he was the wisdom of solomon he was the psalms of david he was the all in all and the everything from a to z come on somebody and now jesus was the fullness of all of that in one body but now he didn't promise there would be another like that never again you see he was god's unique son he would put in him his fullness all of god jesus wasn't god by portion jesus was all of god that was in moses jeremiah ezekiel and all him that had it then now it was now all in him it's all in him it's all in him the fullness of the godhead is all in him and i'm not singing you to sleep it was in that body but on the day of pentecost he did something miraculous he poured out it was canosis he he he can chinos or poured out his spirit he he began to pour out his spirit into a body but in the last day he empties it until the fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in a bride and of his fullness we have received grace for grace now he said now remember we're not the word but we are the word uh-huh you know you got it jesus was not god but he was god he was a man yet he was god he could cry yet he could raise the dead he could cry for a man being dead and raised him back up again he's jehovah jordan jehovah alpha jehovah manasses he's jehovah all completely he was jehovah and yet he was a man he owned the earth and made the earth and that not a place to lay his head he said the birds that i that i made has got nests i haven't got a place to lay my head the foxes i created got holes in the ground and i haven't even got one myself even to be buried in that's right he had to borrow somebody's grave to be buried in he created a womb that had that was he created a womb that was in a woman he had no womb to be born in he had to borrow a womb he created the earth he had not a place to be buried in he had to borrow a hole to be to be buried in with joseph of armithia they had to borrow a place yet he was god he proved he was god now you understand we are messiahs but not that jesus he is our father we're just anointed with his spirit and that's the reason his life that and that gets people if you just don't sit and think it through it gets people think well this guy would be the messiah sure he is he said this one over here could be they both are see well how can there be two of them there's thousands of them but you see his life was separated on the day of pentecost and when that pillar fire came down it separated like tongues and sat upon each of them god divided himself among his people because christ and the church in christ is one just like husband and wife are one and the messiah brother bradham said when god was made flesh and became messiah then we if we can yield ourselves to be anointed like he he was we become a messiah see brother branham's telling us it ain't just one you know they they got one guy over in south africa you know that they have made to be elohim they got another in england they're made to be the holy ghost you know they had a one that they buried that they they made to be michael the archangel yeah nonsense you know again you know they they you know because they were looking for a messiah in one man and that's not where the messiah is the messiah is in a multi-bodied people not just in tim pruitt amen oh he's the anointed one now oh no i'm not i am anointed but i'm not that anointed one amen there's one anointed one and that's jesus but he's anointed many in this last day to show forth his fairness and they are the standing light in this church age and we hadn't we hadn't gone out messiah means the anointed one means king then if the church is anointed by the messiah spirit it becomes a lesser but still a messiah because it's his light reflecting his power reflecting his glory reflecting his dominion god called us to become kings and priests like god he made you he made you as a god to be like adam to have dominion if i can leave you with anything that as a messiah or a messiah you were made to have dominion i want you to look at your problem your affliction the situation the problem in your home the the situat listen you were made to be one who has dominion amen you were not made to live in defeat you were not made to be defeated by any disease any problem any situation you are a master of all situations you say there's a storm brother to him you are the master of that storm speak to it you say there's a mountain in my way i can't get over around or through speak to it you say there is a there is something there that is not bearing fruit in my life speak to that thing you don't have to have it brother branham said in the easter seal now if he was the messiah might be the anointed one for that day to fulfill the word of god to be the redeemer and the anointed one and god raised up that body his bride is the anointed one for this day and is the rising of the sun he's alive forevermore the same yesterday today and forever hebrews 13 8 notice messiah the anointed one so is his bride the messiah the anointed one amen the choosing of the bride he said god's spirit is on his word the messianic the anointed word the bride must be the messiah the anointed word not just the word the anointed one people are calling the word word word word said it's the word and the word only well what's in the word there's healing in the word there's power in the word there's salvation in the word there's dynamics in the word it's always there in the word the word is a person not a book not a theology not a learning not that i can pass on is a person you receive and you get that word on the inside of you you got dunamis dynamite power on the inside of you and god made you to have dominion [Applause] because you're a messiah how often did brother branham say if i had the spirit of bethover in me i'd write music if i had the spirit of john dillinger and me i'd kill and rob but he said if i have the spirit of christ i'm going to do the works of christ [Applause] and paul said if you don't have the spirit of christ you're none of his before the fall adam was a man with dominion he operated in a realm of faith he had he had a body whereby he could contact the earth see taste smell filling here but he had an inward spirit that contacted the heavenly realm and he brought heaven down to earth what made eden the eden it was adam he kept everything in order i'm talking to some people right now who are the same messiahs that adam was in the beginning the messiah brother branham said if he gets back to god he's a messiah the little messiah if messiah means anointed one and you're anointed then what are you that's exactly right a messiah go wake jesus he would say this they should have known these disciples that he was the messiah and the word messiah means the anointed one he had all god in him god was in him jesus the son said i do nothing in myself but i when i see my father do it the father dwelleth in me see he too had a body that could die that could feel that could touch come on and even now he's got a body that can feel your infirmities because the bible said he could be touched you come and tell me about your troubles i'm touched by the feeling of your infirmity i'm touched i get reports every day from brother ron spencer and every day i'm touched but jesus is touched amen come on jesus is touched but he's really waiting for the jesus inside of you to get touched get awakened well you're just not feeling with sympathy for somebody come out now but where did you move in that dimension amen oh brother branham would often say yeah i've got to feel how they're feeling i've got to go in there i got to get into his spirit and feel how he's feeling because only when you love somebody only when you have feelings for somebody there's a spirit in you that has to be stirred awakened brought forth just brought to the forefront i know we don't like to think of it being asleep i i i mean brought to the forefront jesus was literally asleep in the boat but he had to be brought to the forefront i'm saying to the church today you know there's a jesus in this church but he's got to be brought to the forefront where this is more than a society of a church this is more than just membership this is more than just church attendance but jesus is brought to the forefront recognized and begins to operate in the spirit brother branham said with that messiah he was messiah by that with that anointing made him fully messiah my father dwells in me we with the same spirit was upon him not important but the same in quality with a portion upon us would make us like messiahs brother brandon said that portion is omnipotent it's got the power to speak a world and go live on it we know because it did we're living on the world he spoke into existence i'm talking about the one in you come on amen i'm talking about what you have been born of in the spirit who you are as a messiah and he says we with the same spirit upon him not important same in quality see same same everything he's omnipotent all powerful there's no big i always liked it there's a young preacher here and brother bradley would say there's no big spots in god no little weak spots in god the very little touch of god is omnipotent then i say let that god speak let that one act out of my life amen let that one move out i mean it was so real to peter he said seven gold i don't have but i got something in the name of jesus christ rise up and walk he says with that portion of bonus would make us like messiahs would be little sons of god adopted sons of god his holy spirit is sealed us in his body and we're as children there should be nothing bothers nothing worry us where he is if it ain't well we're false witnesses we've been testifying as something that's not even so i believe it i believe that right now we are the sons of god not we will be but right now and now we're seated together in heavenly places in christ i know you're getting tired but i want you to know we're at an end time and noah in his end time could look around and he could see the sons of cain and the wickedness that was going in the land because of the sons of cain and that's what you're seeing again the sons of cain see it didn't make it over the ark oh yes it did because the bible said they all married wives such as they chose and even right down to noah's sons maybe even know his wife but nevertheless even though we may not be able to see the physical aspects in the sense of features or this or that we can see a a bunch of people masses without life dead staring their face killers murders the spirit of the beast taken over they've given their mind to the beast you know just reading in california they you know they they just the gop that's the conservative bunch just just supported and nominated some some um rat you know it's a he's transgender and and and and um you know with it with long hair this multi rainbow colors and you know there and and and he says i'm an anarchist and i hate god and and i and and i hate the values of this country and they and they support him how can we do that without their minds turning their hearts on evil continually and we're look we're standing here and saying today we are people who have an ark and god told us to get in it and it's been built through the word and the only way out of here is through jesus christ he's the door and we see the supernatural happening and the people in that day they can look around and see the supernatural they can see animals coming in do you realize an eden condition all of a sudden started happening with lions and tigers and giraffes and rhinos gorillas and monkeys and deer and antelope all kinds under eden condition started coming in the anointing started coming on them and moved them into the ark no it didn't gather them there was an anointing gathered finally god said go in the ark the family got in the door shut you see noah was the anointed one of that day but how it flew in the face of everybody else you mean you're the only one that god's going to save you and jehovah is this kind of a mean of god he's such a mean god he's going to destroy everybody and kill little children and innocent women and people because they don't believe in your god and he sends a sign and a message and you in this last day are a sign and a message he said well it bothers me brother tim i mean you know we're stigma we walked down and yeah i i know i looked and i was in town the other day and i looked and i saw a lady and i said that looks like one of ours why is that because you're a sign your long hair is a sign you're obedient to god's word you put his word above styles what everybody else thinks what makes you look smart you put his word ahead you put his word ahead of makeup come on you don't have to be persuaded there's an anointing you don't have to have a preacher bully club you over the head to get you to do right there's an anointing you move right into the ark because you're anointed you move right in because the holy spirit is upon you and he has anointed you to preach and everywhere you're going you're preaching [Music] come on hey man my wife you know when when we when we we were out among some people the other day out in in public and there she she's wearing her hat and she's wearing god bless them bill and johnny mayo sent us some beautiful little treasures and one of them there that we love so much is uh is a little face mask that says god god's miracle oh she could walk out with her hair looking like half of the other women that we saw she could fit right in with all of them but she put her hat on and covered her head and said god's miracle and i want you to know you're assigned to the world you are god's miracle because there's been a transformation take place in you and change you from death into life and made a messiah out of you where that you can go and display the power of jesus christ and you can give a warning to the rest of the world you better get in the ark jesus christ so brother tim he's not our type well he is a type of the foolish virgin but he's also a type of us because there's three layers of that ark and that wood was a certain wood it was a porous wood that had to be filled with the life of another tree and god cut down a tree at calvary somebody help me preach right now amen and emptied out the pitch of that life amen of that tree come on amen i made that pitch to put in poorest humanity because you were made to be filled with the spirit of god amen and you know what that will do it will mean it will impregnate you and make you so feel till you are you are actually safe from the judgment waters but not only did he do that but he did three stories of it justification and sanctification and baptism of the holy ghost and there's only one window out which you can see god and that's when you get the baptism of the holy ghost and that's when you can start looking up because this is where he made him i don't want you looking out here come on i want you looking up here and that's what god does he makes us righteous like himself and makes us his messiahs i would like to read the scripture and then we're going to close romans chapter 8 verse 29 we all know it for whom he did for no he also did determine their destiny for them he knew before before the foundational world he also determined their destiny he predestinated and to be con oh wait a minute what is our destiny to be conformed to what sports stars movie stars all these pop stars and rock stars and the more stars and the fallen stars whom he did for no he predestinated you he set your destiny to be conformed to the image of his son in other words he set your destiny to be like jesus amen to be filled with jesus from the inside out amen that why that he might be the firstborn among many brethren it's not gonna just be me i'm gonna have many brothers hallelujah i'm talking to you brothers of the messiah hallelujah sisters of the messiah amen morning stars maybe stars it can't be put out that can't fade away that's announcing there's a great messiah coming there's a day coming that's the daylight is coming and we are the morning stars announcing his coming [Applause] and you think we're going to fade away we had lost a bit of our glimmer we had lost a bit of our shout we are we shattered with him before the foundational world and we're right here in time doing what we did in eternity because why he wanted to be the firstborn i'm going to be the firstborn and to do this i'm going to be human and i'm going to take on a unique body because i can't come in sex-born body because then i would be under the condemnation of the devil i would be born like like like the serpent taught eve so i'm going to be born in a spoken word body just like the first man was and i'm going to form it in the earth in a womb and i'm going to add to it from the carrots and the cabbage and the vegetables i'm going to add to it cell upon cell and it's going to be a human body but then i'm going to fill it with my fullness so that the father dwells in me in other words the one who created the body dwells in the body he created it's not that it's not that hard to understand he was a father in that he conceived a son but that son he stepped into and there's not two of them there's only one and jesus the son couldn't be his own father but the father could be the son and so god stepped into it for the purpose of redemption to feel your pain to feel your sorrows to go through life as you do it's a body satan had no claim on hallelujah amen because why when he was born he was born as emmanuel it would be god with us he goes to river jordan he brings that body he brings that body to be filled with the spirit and that's what you got to do that's what we call repentance and being baptized is where you bring your body to be filled with his own spirit so it wouldn't be you trying to live the message no more and you find it so hard to do why do i have to do this and why do i have to do that it won't be hard if you get jesus in you because really only jesus can live the christian life and if you get jesus in you it's not hard anymore because why you do what jesus does you think like jesus thinks you act like jesus acts you believe like jesus believes amen oh that he might be the firstborn among many brethren i wasn't quite through with that moreover hey this ain't all of it whom he did predestinate he called you remember when he called you amen he don't leave them out there he calls them whom he did predestinate them he also called that in all of it and then that he called what'd he do he justified he declared them righteous he purged them by his blood and where he could not dwell in moses and elijah and all them but just anoint them somebody help me but he come in christ a spoken word body now then here by his blood he can redeemed so he could come in sexual born bodies and those sexual born bodies could be filled with deity that god oh hallelujah now make what the serpent did act way that god wants him to amen because every one of us was born in sin and shaped in iniquity and we came the way of the curse somebody help me preach but i want you to know that that body that satan entered into with adam when he yielded up the immortal spirit and took their immortality are you with me and now sin enters in him and now he does what satan wants his hands to what satan wants his eyes to seize what satan wants his feet goes where the serpent wants him and that's the condition you were born in by your first birth that's why your members the bible said your members you yielded your members to sin smoking drinking lying cursing vulgarity pornography sex sins every kind of horrible thing you did them we did them come on amen but god who is rich in mercy amen he called you he said come unto me there's a deposit in you i knew you before the foundation war before satan got to you i knew you before oh my before you ever did one sin you were mine come on come on then be called what did he do he justified what does justified me he made you as though you never did it your sins were washed away you stand there pure unadulterated the son or daughters of god justified and then he justified he also glorified we've already been seen in glorified bodies that's a great way to look at it he made us righteous like himself and them that he made righteous he made messiahettes because he cannot come into a being that satan still lives in are you with me that's why salvation is the casting out of satan that's why we believe in the miracle of salvation that's why i can believe in casting out any devil because it happened to me then he made righteous like himself then he made messiahs let me go back over there he could not come into bodies until he made a body he could come and dwell in stop and think when it came down to abraham what did he do he gathered up the elements and stepped into a body and appeared to abraham he called him lord he recognized him as lord come on it was god dwelling in the body he steps out the body vanishes and he vanishes he still goes the body went back to the elements why didn't why didn't he take a man uh let's say job lived in that time why didn't he take job and say okay i'm going to step into job and i'm going to perform the sign of the son of man and i'm he couldn't do it job his body wasn't redeemed and god couldn't dwell in that kind of vessel somebody helped me now then coming on down so he would have to make bodies for him to don't come in and appear and he would he'd do the same thing in in the fiery furnace and anywhere that he made himself tangible or visible somebody with me now now let's come on a little bit further on this now then but finally it comes to jesus and jesus will be god's unique his one and only son amen and god will create a body that he can come live in and at the river of jordan the fullness of the spirit of god comes and dwells in jesus christ and he says it's not me the human that does the work but my father that lives in me in me dwells the messiah and he does this work but then what happened he took his body and his body became the sacrifice for your sin the perpetuation to cleanse you to provide a blood that god would take and cleanse you so cleanse you till he could come and dwell in a sexual-born body hallelujah wipe all your past cleanse all your buy a greater blood than bulls and goats somebody help me amen this is what he would do he would do this when god now steps into sexual born bodies to make them a messiah men and women filled with the spirit men and women who have an evil past that the world knows oh that man oh that woman you know he comes and he says you did this you did not and god said they're not guilty i washed them i justified them i made them righteous and i'm dwelling in there and it's not the old man anymore it's christ now living in for them he did foreknow then he also did pre-destiny to be conformed to the image of his son he made he he marked out copies of himself watch now i'm going to read you the phillips translation moreover can you put that back up moreover we know that those who love god who are called according to plan everything happens that happens fits into the pattern for good give us a verse before one more 28. okay karen here's your favorite scripture now listen philip's translation moreover we know that to those who love god how many loves him who are called according to his plan can you say mama that's me everything that happens everything that happens fits into a pattern for good nothing bad can happen to you that don't turn for your good because you're a messiah this thing happened to me but it's going to turn it happens in a pattern because god has a pattern of goodness you're going to fit in it are you with me all right so he said it happened now give me the next verse god in his foreknowledge chose them to bear the family likeness of his son i look like the family of god come on amen are you with me amen listen he he did this god in his foreknowledge chose them to be bear the family likeness of his son that he might be the eldest of the family of many brothers amen the first of humans to overcome the first of cursed earth to give it back to the devil to be surrendered to god to use their body for holiness to yield their members to righteousness that he might be the eldest of the family of many brothers he chose them long ago hello thing about it is if he chose you he won't ever unchoose you he chose them long ago and when the when the time came and everybody has their time brother brandon said hey a predestinated seed can go a long time before it becomes germinated you say well my kid you know he sat in the message church and he or he already preached and we taught in the precept and he said don't give up let me tell you something over and over again never give up on the harvest you're planted you're going to reap it's the law of god don't give up on the harvest you're planting the seed it's going to come up it'll germinate sometime somewhere the rain's going to hit it the anointing's going to come hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thanks be to god amen he chose him long ago and when the time came he called him when the time came he called tim pruitt when the time came he called you and you and you and you why did he do it when you were there forget about why he called you he chose you amen and at that time you came and the time came he called them and he made them righteous in his sight now what does it matter what the world and the devil and everything else says about you he made you righteous in his sight and then he lifted them to the splendor of life as his own sons now you can shout amen that's what it means to be glorified he lifted you to the splendor of life as his own sons you're not of the world little children you are a god and you overcome him because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world hallelujah then he also glorified or he lifted them he lifted you from that ragged sinful dirty life and lifted you into a position of sonship he glorified you by making you a wicked beggar a son but i'm going to give you a little secret you always were a son you didn't become a son of the altar you just found out you were a son that you didn't belong to the devil and it made you recognize when the spirit of jesus came in you it made you recognize god is your father and you cry out ever father my father my god i always loved elijah because his name meant my god is jehovah jehovah's my god i'll serve no other that became the motto of my life when i read elijah's life and it became my motto as a young boy and reading that in the bible and so struck my heart my god is jehovah and i just want to say today my god my god is not some political star my god is not some movie star my god is not some stupid football skull star come on now i mean my god is not any of those god my god is jehovah it is jesus and i can speak jesus over every situation because that's my name i'm born in the family i bear his resemblance i look like him i act like it i am him jesus in a body born in sin but no longer in sin because he justified me by being called and chosen to bear his image and family resemblance for likeness and then he justified me and made me righteous in his sight and now we have been elevated everybody say elevated those that are asleep say elevated okay those that are awake say it now elevated you are elevated amen in his sight to the glory and the splendor of life as his own sons amen god bless you let the musicians come amen let's stand together amen can you just worship the lord a moment can you just thank him lord
