[0:04] hello everyone we are the ministry team
[0:08] at evening light tabernacle in Minden
[0:10] Louisiana and we're glad that you joined
[0:14] with us here this evening for our time
[0:16] of discussion around the round table
[0:19] to share about God's Word we'd love it
[0:22] if you would share with your friends
[0:25] that we're on to today and let others
[0:28] know that we're alive and and bringing a
[0:32] message tonight sharing the gospel of
[0:35] Jesus Christ so we're happy that you've
[0:37] joined with us in this discussion and in
[0:39] our past sessions we have talked about
[0:42] what defines the church and we know
[0:45] there are at least 41,000 different
[0:50] denominations that we have talked about
[0:52] and each one of them have their
[0:54] doctrines and their beliefs and
[0:57] standards and views and but you know
[1:01] Jesus said I am the vine and you are the
[1:05] branches but today we have 41,000
[1:09] different denominational branches that
[1:12] are all seemingly living off the life of
[1:15] Christ how is this possible how does
[1:20] this happen that we come to this point
[1:23] in in time when the first church was
[1:29] born it produced a certain kind of fruit
[1:31] a certain kind of doctor a certain kind
[1:34] of life because the life of Christ was
[1:37] in the church and it produced miracles
[1:40] signs wonders the power of God the love
[1:43] of God the doctrine of Christ but in the
[1:49] illustration that you used of organized
[1:52] religion today it Purdue produces
[1:55] diverse doctrines diverse life diverse
[1:59] nature and directions and it can be very
[2:02] confusing
[2:05] it's kind of like the the citrus tree
[2:08] that we talked about you know and have
[2:12] many different branches that have been
[2:15] grafted by man into what we know is
[2:19] Christianity because in Christianity I
[2:22] know Christ wanted one church right
[2:25] right and now we have 41,000 that have
[2:28] been grafted into that and so awful one
[2:32] tree for example a citrus tree you can
[2:34] have lemons and limes and kumquats and
[2:38] men mandarins and seumas and all
[2:41] different kinds of varieties that are
[2:43] grafted in there but we know this that
[2:46] if it was an orange tree to begin with
[2:48] if that orange tree ever puts forth
[2:51] another branch it would also have
[2:53] oranges and the same would be true of
[2:56] Christianity that you know if the the
[3:00] original vine put forth a book of Acts
[3:02] then wouldn't wouldn't then if it puts
[3:06] with another branch that it would also
[3:08] write another book of Acts behind it
[3:10] absolutely it would have to because it's
[3:13] the same life and the same lights going
[3:15] to produce the same fruit this signs the
[3:18] wonders and the life lived out of the
[3:20] believer it's going to produce that
[3:22] because it's coming from that original
[3:24] vine it would have to that's what they
[3:26] said in the book of Acts the Bible said
[3:28] that in the book of Acts they called
[3:31] them Christians and it said they
[3:33] perceived that Peter and John had been
[3:36] with Jesus yes because the works that
[3:38] Jesus was doing they were doing not the
[3:41] gate a beautiful it was the same life
[3:43] and it wasn't something they called
[3:44] themselves people recognize this is the
[3:47] same life the same fruit mm-hmm the same
[3:50] thing now there's just more right when
[3:53] the life comes from the bond to the
[3:55] branches it's you know with Peter it was
[3:57] very amazing to see the difference it
[4:00] made in his life you know you had a man
[4:01] that went from denying Christ you know
[4:05] the things that he'd done the situations
[4:08] that he was in you know and Jesus's even
[4:11] said get behind me Satan you know things
[4:13] like that and then he but he comes to
[4:15] Pentecost
[4:16] into the outpouring of the Holy Ghost
[4:17] and the man gets up boldly he denied in
[4:21] front of a you know one person they're
[4:23] denied Jesus but now after the Holy
[4:26] Ghost came the life coming through that
[4:28] vine into him he gets a boldly and
[4:30] preaches a sermon and saves three
[4:32] thousand three thousand people give the
[4:34] heart he's a different person in four
[4:35] together living totally saying I don't
[4:37] know him just standing up there in acts
[4:39] 2:22 and proclaiming Jesus of Nazareth a
[4:43] man you know approved hold him by the
[4:45] name that's what I called him by name
[4:46] and said by these signs and these
[4:48] wonders you approved by God to you he
[4:51] wasn't no longer ashamed or afraid a man
[4:54] a man praise the Lord well so in the
[4:56] case of the vine then Jesus was original
[4:59] and then from him then after he ascended
[5:04] there come a vine or a branch out of
[5:07] that vine out of the root which was
[5:09] Christ which was a book of Acts church I
[5:13] just wonder you know when we think of
[5:16] this it it just amazes me to think of it
[5:20] you know here was Jesus men and women
[5:23] men and women that were filled with the
[5:26] life of Jesus Jesus man
[5:28] Jesus women I wonder what Satan really
[5:32] saw there when that that day when the
[5:36] upper room opened and they spilled out
[5:39] of there and they're speaking in other
[5:40] languages and all glorifying God and now
[5:44] there's not just one Jesus there's a
[5:46] hundred and twenty that has been birthed
[5:49] by the same spirit of Jesus the same
[5:52] Holy Ghost and what he saw the day of
[5:55] Pentecost was the emergence of a
[5:57] victorious church wonderful he saw the
[6:00] same thing that he saw when Jesus
[6:01] stepped out of the boat at the maniac
[6:03] exactly that's right and that come
[6:06] charging it up there to Jesus and he's
[6:07] looking you know no doubt looked in his
[6:09] eyes and said what are you doing in
[6:11] there yeah yeah God had come into man
[6:15] now it's not a one-man but many I like
[6:18] to think it was an emergency and held
[6:19] that day here he is thinking he has
[6:21] victory and he stomped this one out and
[6:24] in one day not only was it 120 but by
[6:26] the end of the day it was 3,000 120 yeah
[6:29] in one day so he saw the men and women
[6:33] under the influence of something that
[6:36] had really never been seen before except
[6:38] in Jesus Christ amen and that they were
[6:40] under the influence of the Holy Ghost
[6:43] and that dynamic power of God was now
[6:46] flowing through their lives and gave
[6:48] them a bonus in their lives
[6:50] beautiful beautiful yeah man well the
[6:53] Jesus was a man approved of God by signs
[6:56] wonders and miracles in other words
[6:58] Jesus never was a self-promoter no it
[7:02] would he allowed God to promote him and
[7:06] he said if you don't believe me believe
[7:07] the works for they testify of me Ryan so
[7:10] God was approving the Ministry of Jesus
[7:13] Christ but on the day of Pentecost we
[7:15] see a church approved of God by signs
[7:17] wonders and miracles yeah the same God
[7:20] that that vindicated Jesus Christ is now
[7:24] vindicating the church and it's flowing
[7:26] through and they are in fact the branch
[7:29] that bears the fruit the vine don't bear
[7:32] the fruit it's the branch that bears the
[7:35] fruit right and it's the bear the branch
[7:37] that is manifesting the life of the vine
[7:39] and now the energy is being poured into
[7:42] the church right now this is God's
[7:44] desire to bear fruit and the people
[7:47] could glorify God to see God manifested
[7:51] in his people
[7:51] no easy to see in the book of Acts but
[7:54] so come to today if we're gonna say we
[7:57] are the church or were a part of that
[7:59] great body the church then it must be a
[8:02] church approved by God with the same
[8:04] signs wonders and miracles if he's the
[8:08] same yesterday today and forever and he
[8:10] is the God that does not change then the
[8:12] church cannot change that God would
[8:15] never change his pattern right and that
[8:17] means that there must be an endtime
[8:19] Church that he'll return for that is
[8:22] bearing the fruit of God
[8:24] the Norns bears forth again it comes
[8:27] puts out a branch it's gonna be an old
[8:29] man very simple time yes so all the
[8:33] other branches are given a false witness
[8:35] on the life of the vine because they're
[8:37] truly not on the vine they've wrapped it
[8:39] in I think that's what we're finding in
[8:41] our day you said there's 41 different
[8:42] thousand forty-one thousand different
[8:44] denominations grafted into this vine
[8:48] which is Christ we know that's Christ so
[8:50] I believe to me personally I just think
[8:52] that it's men who may have gone before
[8:54] they were commissioned to do something
[8:56] for God and they got ahead of the plan
[8:58] of God and they taken their own idea and
[9:00] they made it fit into the vine versus
[9:03] allowing the vine just producing other
[9:05] branch through their life or through
[9:06] their ministry and now that's why you
[9:08] find 41 different thousand denominations
[9:10] well many of them started out though his
[9:13] true men that was moved by the Holy
[9:15] Spirit of God man and they they
[9:18] something became real to them and and
[9:21] they started out with a real sincere
[9:23] desire to serve God but then you know as
[9:27] time along and their followers then just
[9:30] kind of made a little set out of that
[9:32] move of God and and they camp down on
[9:36] that rather than going on into the Full
[9:38] Gospel so every one of these 40 1000s
[9:42] have a portion of truth you know they
[9:45] they they have a truth that that were
[9:49] even founded on but they fail to go into
[9:53] all of the truth and produce that very
[9:56] life of Christ
[9:57] you know um this brings me to the
[10:00] scripture the Peter on the day of
[10:03] Pentecost that he referred back to the
[10:06] book of Joel yeah and he said as they
[10:09] you know where some mocking saying these
[10:12] people are full of new wine and so on
[10:14] well then he said but these are not
[10:17] drunk as you suppose seeing this is the
[10:19] third hour today but this is that which
[10:21] was spoken by the Prophet Joel so he
[10:24] could go back to the scripture and see
[10:27] where this move of God was in the
[10:30] scripture where God had promised this
[10:32] that he would promised a pouring out
[10:35] of God's Spirit and it said and it shall
[10:38] come to pass in the last days saith god
[10:41] I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh
[10:44] and your sons and your daughters shall
[10:47] prophesy and your young men shall see
[10:50] visions your old men shall dream dreams
[10:52] now notice it it said in the last days
[10:56] and that last days covers 2000 years of
[11:00] the times of the Gentiles where God has
[11:03] been pouring out his spirit and so you
[11:07] know each one have received a measure of
[11:09] the Spirit but this is a day at a time
[11:12] where God promises and calls for a full
[11:15] restoration
[11:17] amen so you said on my servants of mine
[11:19] my handmaidens I will pour out in those
[11:21] days of my spirit they some prophecy
[11:24] I'll show wonders in the heavens above
[11:26] signs in the earth beneath blood and
[11:29] fire and vapor of smoke and the Sun
[11:31] shall be turned to darkness and the moon
[11:33] into blood before that great and notable
[11:36] day of the lord shall come and it shall
[11:38] come to pass that whosoever shall call
[11:41] on the name of the Lord shall be saved
[11:43] what a wonderful promise that is
[11:46] beautiful wonderful brother Tim do you
[11:49] believe that that that scripture that
[11:51] that Peter is quoting he seems to he
[11:56] seems to apply it to that day but he
[11:59] also seems to apply it to a future day
[12:01] do you believe that Scriptures can be
[12:03] used more than once oh yeah descriptors
[12:06] can have dual meanings and and dual
[12:09] applications for example he would use
[12:14] the scripture out of Egypt have I called
[12:17] my son well he called Israel out of
[12:20] Egypt he called Jesus out of Egypt we
[12:23] know when they took the young child in
[12:25] there and so and so and I think even
[12:28] today that God still will apply that
[12:30] scripture because out of Egypt out of
[12:33] bondage out of sin out of unbelief out
[12:36] of sectarianism and denominationalism
[12:38] he's calling his son sons and daughters
[12:41] back to him
[12:42] amen amen and like you said calling his
[12:47] son
[12:48] donors there is not that you don't we
[12:50] don't think that there's not sons and
[12:52] daughters of God within those 41,000
[12:55] different denominations but what we what
[12:57] we're saying is he's not calling those
[12:59] denominations of he'll call people out
[13:01] of those denominations unto himself
[13:03] that's right and that's what we will see
[13:05] people brought to right that's the only
[13:07] place true salvation is found is in
[13:10] Christ and we can never substitute
[13:13] Christ for an organization or for any
[13:16] kind of program it'll simply not work so
[13:19] we must get the people to Christ as
[13:21] ministers of the gospel as Christians
[13:24] that witness Christ to the world the
[13:27] only place salvation can ever be found
[13:30] is in Christ and I think any true
[13:33] minister any true church any true son or
[13:35] daughter of God will honestly point the
[13:38] people to Christ if they want to see
[13:40] people saved that's true a major failure
[13:43] the failure of the modern church is
[13:45] getting people to church within not
[13:47] getting them to Christ that's right get
[13:49] them in the pews you invite them for
[13:51] some type of supper some type of program
[13:53] and they get them there but then there's
[13:55] no nothing there to change that person's
[13:57] life because they're not pointing them
[13:59] to the power of Jesus Christ right to
[14:02] true salvation but if Christ is
[14:04] returning for a church then we should
[14:07] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[14:09] delivered by in that first church that's
[14:11] what we should be fighting for striving
[14:13] for and reaching for so really I mean if
[14:16] you get people to Christ
[14:17] they'll come to church that's that's
[14:20] right there you know yeah that bear
[14:24] forth the fruit I mean that's what Jesus
[14:26] said you know and so that is the point
[14:28] and that's the drive that's everything
[14:30] that we want everything that we desire
[14:32] is to get people to Jesus Christ now it
[14:35] took freed not to a Dogma not to a
[14:37] building not to a church but to Christ
[14:40] and then if you get them to Christ then
[14:42] you don't have to have all the programs
[14:43] and the whole truth to try to hold them
[14:46] to try to hold them or get involved
[14:48] forget it you get a young person to
[14:50] Christ hey if it gets what what they got
[14:53] on the day of Pentecost
[14:54] that's all our God in his
[14:56] like see the power of the holy guilty
[14:59] man you won't have to beg them to to
[15:02] worship you won't have to beg them to
[15:03] come to church no yeah it won't be
[15:06] programs that and and you know
[15:09] entertainment that brings them if you
[15:11] won't need a rock-and-roll band you
[15:14] won't you won't need some artificial
[15:16] smoke you'll have the glory of God in
[15:18] that your last Ray's the Lord and that's
[15:20] what we want to see is the glory of God
[15:23] working in the church and they had that
[15:25] right there and that's what we're
[15:26] talking about they had him on the day of
[15:28] Pentecost and we know they operated in
[15:30] it for a time that's right
[15:33] so so where did where did things turn at
[15:35] what point do we start seeing that
[15:37] change because obviously between men and
[15:39] now there's this vast chasm between that
[15:43] church and what people called the church
[15:45] today and surely it didn't happen
[15:47] overnight well no it didn't you know it
[15:53] didn't happen overnight but you know it
[15:56] happened where that Satan remember I
[16:00] talked about how that he he saw that
[16:02] book of Acts Church and what he saw he
[16:05] saw men and women powered and empowered
[16:08] but what Satan also said I want to
[16:10] church and I want this worship and and
[16:13] so you know the the whole work of the
[16:17] devil has been to try to get himself
[16:21] into the church and defile it and make
[16:24] it lukewarm and turn the worship away
[16:26] from the true God to himself and and so
[16:29] were that Satan according to the Bible
[16:32] would become the god of this evil
[16:34] atheist and he would be worshipped by
[16:36] millions yes sir and so it's it's a it's
[16:40] a very bad thing that that has happened
[16:42] that the church because once you once
[16:45] you get off the foundation you lose that
[16:47] power there was numerous scriptures in
[16:50] the New Testament prophesying and
[16:52] indicating that there would be a falling
[16:54] away so it was no surprise to God as he
[16:59] prophesied through Paul and different
[17:01] writers of the New Testament that there
[17:03] there was coming a falling away of the
[17:06] church and also a restoration of the
[17:09] church
[17:09] and I think it would be good to maybe
[17:14] deal with that in the next session oh
[17:16] that would be wonderful in and so in our
[17:19] next session we want to deal with that
[17:21] about the church and how that Satan got
[17:25] into the church and defiled it and made
[17:29] it lukewarm and powerless and took it
[17:31] off its original foundation and then the
[17:34] promised restoration because jesus said
[17:37] I will build a church and that church
[17:40] the gates of Hell will not prevail
[17:43] against a man so I'm convinced that here
[17:46] you know in the endgame that Jesus will
[17:49] have a church that the gates of Hell
[17:51] will not prevail against right and in
[17:53] our next session how we'd like to talk
[17:55] to you about this church that God is
[17:58] raising up in the end time because
[18:00] prophecy will be fulfilled there will be
[18:02] a rapture yes Church of Jesus Christ
[18:05] amen they'll be a bride without spot and
[18:07] raises god bless you
