========================================

you know the other day i made mention of sister lana she just had a clear scan um just a few days ago a few weeks ago now and the kin remains cancer free and we thank god for that and man that she had a great moment of victory um in the service of february the 18th 2018 where i was preaching on the revealing of sons and that's now been nearly two and a half years ago and god is still on the throne still manifests in his great glory and that same service we had a brother john christophel from uh south africa that contacted me about his wife's condition of stage three rectal cancer and he being in south africa there he had been able unable to get a job and he was in a very bad financial condition a young young minister and his wife and they were struggling and struggling with the um the the medical bills and so on and and um you know we we at that time were certainly uh preaching a lot of different things along the realm of faith and believing for our sister lana and just encouraged her and encouraged the people and encourage us to believe god for his words and his promises and um to see god come on the scene and to see um the lord heal sister lana with that fourth stage uh hodgkin's lymphoma and god healed her and delivered her just instantly completely and um you know where that she went back the next day on the i think it was the 19th on a monday or tuesday at least just that week and had a scan and doctors didn't know what to say about it and there it is right there where the cancer is in the lung and there it is the next scan and there's there is absolutely no cancer and this is still the testimony today two and a half years later amen we thank god for that [Applause] this um very same time that this was going on this brother from south africa i've never met him but you know there's just sometimes it's things just grip your heart and he told me about his situation and and um and so he i told him i would send him a prayer cloth because we believed according to the book of acts that they took handkerchiefs from the body or aprons from the body of saint paul and laid them upon the sick and they were healed now of course we're not saint paul but he's still the same jesus amen and his word is still the truth so we sent out in the i prayed over that in the post and and uh this same week of sister atlanta's scan i received a um an unsolicited email uh with from brother john uh giving me um photos of his wife and his testimony and um i wanted to just go back into that service just a moment where that we prayed for her and i i want to i'm doing this for a reason i'm doing this for a reason because i i think we must come with very great sincerity in every service expecting god to move and when we pray if it's even somebody from overseas somewhere over in south africa we never heard of we've never seen it doesn't matter they're our brother and sister in christ and we're going to pray with fervency and believe god for them amen so michael if you will take us back into that service just for a moment just for this clip where we prayed for brother john christopher and his wife voice of yours right now the bible said that you call on the name of the lord you shall be saved amen you want deliverance deliverances in the house of god i mean you need peace in your life there's peace like a river you need joy there's joy like a river oh man there's peace like a fountain there's the holy ghost to move in your life to turn you to faith to cause you to believe to lift you up out of sin hallelujah i don't care how long you've been bound amen i don't care how long you felt defeated i don't care how long you've been in slavery we are heard a voice that said let my people go and there's some devil tormentors in this building this morning that's going to torment the devil until we leave from here we're not going to give him any peace we're not going to give him any rest but there is some devil that fears some serpent bruisers some overcomers some people that are empowered where he's revealing himself hallelujah revealing himself in your life this morning amen giving you the faith to believe this for me hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i said hallelujah i said let's praise our god let's say i say god is moving in stream why don't you react amen not in a formal way but in the power of the holy ghost let him lift you up today to rise with him hallelujah hallelujah satan i announce to you you are defeated i announce to you they're sons of god that are in it that are the actors on the scene right now where god is revealing himself in his sonship in sons of god to declare to this generation the name and the authority of jesus christ now take your lying deceiving speaking hands over god's people i lose them this morning to serve the living god able to have joy like they've never known to be free of the bondage and the slave bells of sin and i believe in the name of jesus christ i declare it hallelujah now thank you for it go to praise and invite amen everything has to bow to the name of jesus christ [Applause] let my people go [Music] hallelujah hallelujah [Music] thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you lord we glorify your name lord for your worthy hallelujah down at the cross where my savior died glory to his name will you worship with me this morning i've got in my hands this morning a couple of prayer cloths [Music] they're going to go to south africa to a little home where a little preacher [Music] without a job in a broken condition with a little wife in the third stages of rectal cancer [Music] and we're sending on the wings of this trap we're here as devil defeaters serpent bruisers sending a message that they're sons of god being revealed in this day and we are taking over satan's dominion [Music] amen we're we're sending it right here as it did in the book of acts where from the body of paul hankers was taken late on the sick aprons laid on the sick and evil spirits departed from them i believe it's going to happen amen you may have a need in your life this morning while i pray for this and you pray with me i want you to pray as we bind the devil and the power of satan satan you are defeated in the hands of a redeemed son amen in the congregation of redeemed children of god we are standing this morning in prayer for a counterpart over in south africa in a little town maybe a little place maybe if you're feeling forgotten maybe feeling feeling a reject or are not not important europe you are speaking to them this morning amen even as we send on the wings of this prayer healing healing in the name of jesus satan you have bound god's people long enough but the eyes of god's people the elect is coming open amen there's understanding that it's coming to somebody to believe that they are the call to this generation and i say to this cancer cancer you cannot stand in the presence of god and i rebuke you in the name of jesus taken the authority of the word of god and commanded you to leave that body and for the misfortunes that follow this little preacher i pray god you'll get him in your will you'll give him that job that he needs lord i pray not only for them but for all of these that are in this congregation and around the world right now they'll just believe if they'll just believe right now while we pray something is about to happen they just believe lord we're just holding the hand long enough for the swelling to go down amen until until we can see it's dead it's over with it's done and in the name of jesus i proclaim liberty to those that are bound and i proclaim the freedom and the joy of the lord to this church and to the believers who believe now in jesus name for the glory of god amen now lift up those people hands that hang down am i beginning to praise him now from the depths of your heart praise the lord i just got this email from him saying i'm sharing the pictures of how my wife looked during her hospital stay in 2018 how the chemotherapy radiation took her hair which is her glory but god rich in mercy has restored her hair she's completely healed by the hand of the lord i still have that prayer cloth whenever we we feel sick or heavy burden or for any problem we lay that prayer cloth on us and claim god's blessings and healing power over us and we have testimonies of god's grace and healing and and of course um just uh just just weeks right after that that we prayed there he got a job there that was almost impossible to get god just moved on the scene for him in a tremendous way and we want to say thank the lord amen praise the lord hallelujah amen sister atlanta you stand just for a moment just as a trophy of the grace of god amen hallelujah god's not dead he's alive amen he's still working in the hearts and lives
