[50:59] small crowds I started off preaching to

[52:26] some things on our hearts that we're
[52:28] going to be speaking on today and we
[52:31] will read from Daniel chapter 12 and
[52:34] verse 1 even if you're gathered in a in
[52:37] your home today I pray that you'll just
[52:40] make this a real serious time and a holy
[52:43] gathering and that you at this moment in
[52:47] time will stand with us now as we read
[52:49] the word from Daniel chapter 12 and
[52:52] verse 1 it's been a scripture that has
[52:55] been a theme on my heart in the last
[52:57] little bet we've read it several times
[52:59] but we have another scripture to read
[53:01] again that we'll read in Revelation 12
[53:05] also but the scripture said and at that
[53:08] time shall Michael stand up the Great
[53:11] Prince which standeth for the children
[53:13] of thy people and there shall be a time
[53:16] of trouble such as never was since there
[53:18] was a nation even to that same time and
[53:22] that and at that time thy people shall
[53:24] be delivered every one that shall be
[53:26] found written in the book and many of
[53:30] them that sleep in the dust of the earth
[53:31] shall awake some to everlasting life and
[53:34] some to shame and everlasting contempt
[53:37] and they that be wise shall shine as the
[53:40] brightness of the firmament and they
[53:42] that turn many to righteousness as the
[53:44] stars for ever and ever
[53:47] but Thou O Daniel shut up the words and
[53:50] seal the book even to the time of the
[53:53] end many shall run to and fro and
[53:57] knowledge shall be increased and then
[54:00] with me turn with me to Revelation
[54:02] chapter 12 and we'll read from the
[54:04] seventh verse and there was war in
[54:09] heaven Michael and his angels fought
[54:11] against the Dragon and the dragon fought
[54:15] and his angels and prevailed not neither
[54:19] was their place found any more in heaven
[54:21] and the Great Dragon was cast out that
[54:24] old serpent called the devil and Satan
[54:28] which deceiveth the whole world he was
[54:31] cast out into the earth
[54:33] and his angels were cast out with him
[54:36] amen may God bless you you can be seated
[54:40] we're living in a time of a great
[54:43] trouble of course it's not the the
[54:47] tribulation the Great Tribulation but
[54:49] nevertheless I believe that we're so
[54:51] close to it right now that we're seeing
[54:54] the looming clouds of tribulations it's
[54:57] like a storm that's brewing in the
[55:00] distance and we can hear the rolling of
[55:03] the Thunder we can see the lightning
[55:05] flash in the distance and it's not here
[55:09] yet
[55:09] but it's coming I'm instan Wednesday
[55:12] night about what if our youth camp or
[55:15] our services of the past were just fond
[55:18] memories and I tell you in my heart I
[55:21] believe that we will fellowship again I
[55:23] believe that the things will again come
[55:27] back to somewhat normal again perhaps
[55:30] this is merely a dress rehearsal for
[55:33] what is coming and but I just wanted to
[55:37] say if you're all shook up and uncertain
[55:40] about where you are where you are in
[55:42] Christ and where you stand in Christ
[55:43] it's past time that you find an anchor a
[55:47] man you've got to have an anchor that
[55:49] doesn't depend on others to keep you in
[55:53] the faith a man if it's if this is
[55:56] shaking your faith well it's important
[55:58] you get the token while you can for
[56:01] there will come a time where the Holy
[56:03] Ghost will be gone with the Gentile
[56:04] bride and you know I was thinking about
[56:08] the other day about the services and and
[56:13] the blessing that we had and given
[56:16] having this building that God gave us
[56:18] and everything has been that free and
[56:22] paid for and we thank God for that and I
[56:25] was thinking about it you know God
[56:27] didn't give us this for it to sit empty
[56:29] but then again I thought yeah he did
[56:31] because I plan to leave here hey man I
[56:35] plan for one day for it to be empty I
[56:38] just hope nobody none of you are here
[56:40] amen but you have left to one day
[56:44] perhaps it will be nothing but a stark
[56:47] a sign or emblem of a people that has
[56:51] left that went somewhere mysteriously
[56:55] but I believe that there's going to be a
[56:57] catching away for the bride of Jesus
[56:59] Christ now as things have gone over the
[57:04] last few years or months rather it seems
[57:08] like years time is just drug in those
[57:11] last few days and and you know with
[57:15] where it seemed like everything is came
[57:17] down to a very small space almost but in
[57:21] these times there's been floods I would
[57:24] say floods and quotes passed around
[57:27] about viruses and plagues and everybody
[57:31] is searching for answers and this this
[57:35] is a great need I think as we are
[57:37] looking at times like this we we want to
[57:40] see where we're at and what is promised
[57:43] for this hour and for this time and what
[57:45] can we look for and you know what is
[57:48] true and what is it true and what
[57:50] applies and what doesn't apply and and
[57:54] so today I'm going to be talking about
[57:57] speaking about enforcing our abstract of
[58:01] title or you know how to apply the token
[58:05] in the situation our abstract and so
[58:09] there but you know with these great
[58:12] needs in mind I can't help but go back a
[58:16] couple of weeks ago that I woke up
[58:20] during the night with a with a certain a
[58:23] sudden start with a very clear mind you
[58:26] know how it is many times you wake up to
[58:29] 3:00 in the morning and you're you're
[58:31] foggy minded but it wasn't like that it
[58:33] was really like I was very very clear in
[58:36] my thinking and I was thinking about the
[58:41] the trumpets and going over them in my
[58:45] mind and the seven trumpets in the book
[58:47] of Revelation and and you know it was
[58:50] just going over different aspects from
[58:53] the seven trumpets around Jericho and
[58:57] when the walls came down the
[59:00] Riis going blowing this seven trumpets
[59:02] there and and just going over different
[59:05] aspects of the trumpets and then a few
[59:10] nights later it would be probably five
[59:12] or six nights later and had dreamed that
[59:15] I was being asked to teach on the
[59:18] trumpets to some new people they seemed
[59:21] like new people but I realize that this
[59:24] new to many that this is new rather to
[59:29] many of not most of the message people
[59:32] that because there's been a lot of
[59:35] misunderstandings down through time and
[59:38] listening to the message and sometimes
[59:40] some people are just now understanding
[59:42] the message and others have
[59:44] misunderstood so I believe this has to
[59:47] be taught and so today it may be a
[59:51] little bit of a difficult subject and
[59:54] maybe a little treacherous and some
[59:56] points but I think with many believers
[1:00:00] looking for answer during this time of
[1:00:02] shakin in the world that and many quotes
[1:00:06] that are being shared I thought that I
[1:00:09] would speak about some things because
[1:00:12] how can we enforce our display unless we
[1:00:17] know what we have or what portion is
[1:00:20] ours to manifest our display so we don't
[1:00:25] want to be trying to enforce our bring
[1:00:27] to pass something that does not pertain
[1:00:29] to us we won't we want to we want to
[1:00:34] stand with the word that does protect us
[1:00:38] so well do all the Bible pertain says no
[1:00:40] some other Bible proteins and speaks of
[1:00:43] the horror of the book of Revelation
[1:00:45] some of the Bible speaks about the
[1:00:47] 144,000 which is the Jews some of the
[1:00:50] Bible speaks of the foolish virgins some
[1:00:53] of the speed people speaks about the the
[1:00:56] unbelievers who will who will be lost
[1:00:58] and son and then there is portions of
[1:01:02] the word that is to the believer so in
[1:01:05] one sense us all to us but in the other
[1:01:07] sense there are portions that are
[1:01:10] especially designated to the bride
[1:01:13] for this in time so um this quote was
[1:01:17] just sent to me and I just wanted to use
[1:01:20] it as an example because this was spoke
[1:01:23] of as a prophecy and in brother Branham
[1:01:27] said this in 1954 which is actually
[1:01:31] before I was even born and he said what
[1:01:33] is cancer what is a tomb what what is a
[1:01:36] disease we'll deal on that for the next
[1:01:39] five minutes now what is it cancer what
[1:01:41] caused that thing let's take a cancer or
[1:01:44] anything you wished to take tubercular
[1:01:47] pneumonia
[1:01:47] whatever you wish to any disease
[1:01:49] diseases or germs and let me pass this
[1:01:53] home here quickly as our time is going
[1:01:55] listen did you know the Bible predicts
[1:01:57] that in the last days there be a germ
[1:02:00] warfare that diseases will break out
[1:02:04] upon the people and will fall out on
[1:02:07] everyone without the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:10] Spirit but with the angel or who had the
[1:02:13] charge over the plagues was given orders
[1:02:17] to touch no one on whom the mark was why
[1:02:21] how much kind of teachers have we got to
[1:02:24] be brethren in order to get the to get
[1:02:28] the church in order to be in that
[1:02:30] condition immune my arms are sore now
[1:02:34] from where the doctors have puts needles
[1:02:36] in try to inoculate me from yellow fever
[1:02:40] and so forth I told him I didn't need it
[1:02:42] but they wouldn't listen to me but I'll
[1:02:44] tell you what God's going to do God's
[1:02:47] got a serum and it's called the Holy
[1:02:49] Ghost and when that serum goes in it'll
[1:02:52] knock you late you hallelujah in the
[1:02:55] last days and he breaks off from there
[1:02:57] now the point I wanted to to get this
[1:03:01] the point made in this quote is that we
[1:03:04] have to believe for divine healing
[1:03:06] against diseases sickness and diseases
[1:03:09] will come but we got a remedy amen
[1:03:13] because God heals all diseases but we're
[1:03:18] not exempt from persecution such as
[1:03:21] happening in China and I ask you
[1:03:22] wherever you are to pray for the
[1:03:25] believers in time
[1:03:26] right now who are the Chinese government
[1:03:29] is using this virus and they clamped
[1:03:33] down upon the people to clamp down even
[1:03:35] harder and shut down all gatherings and
[1:03:37] all the home churches were that they
[1:03:40] were kind of meeting under the radar but
[1:03:42] it's now all been closed down and people
[1:03:45] are going to jail we have three of our
[1:03:47] brothers right now that are in prison
[1:03:49] because of you know somebody was found
[1:03:53] with the King James Version Bible and
[1:03:56] and they looked on their phone and
[1:03:58] getting researched and found a pastor
[1:04:00] and they got him in prison and others in
[1:04:03] prison and and it's a very very very
[1:04:05] serious thing because they see this as a
[1:04:08] foreign influence from from America and
[1:04:12] they're they're really clamping down on
[1:04:14] it and they they are under very serious
[1:04:17] consequences there are Iranian believers
[1:04:20] in Turkey that are they're trying to
[1:04:25] deport from there but and and it's
[1:04:29] really serious because they go back to
[1:04:30] Iran it's certain imprisonment and
[1:04:33] probably death so I ask for you to
[1:04:36] believe and pray for those believers
[1:04:38] there but I just want to say we're not
[1:04:42] exempt from sickness cancers viruses
[1:04:45] fevers but we do have a healer and just
[1:04:50] a reminder
[1:04:51] none of these diseases are from him
[1:04:54] every one of these diseases are demons
[1:04:57] and so what we're having is is an
[1:05:01] angelic war that is going on right now
[1:05:05] and it is causing sickness across the
[1:05:10] world but I want you to understand that
[1:05:14] this prophecy or this quote that we
[1:05:17] speak about I just read it refers to
[1:05:20] Bible prophecy the Bible predicts said
[1:05:22] in the last day that there be a germ
[1:05:25] warfare that diseases will break out
[1:05:27] upon the people and will fall on
[1:05:29] everyone without the baptism of the Holy
[1:05:32] Spirit but with the angel who had charge
[1:05:35] of these plagues was given orders to
[1:05:38] touch no
[1:05:39] on whom the mark was now this is a
[1:05:41] prophecy but it doesn't happen in our
[1:05:44] day it happens in the Tribulation Period
[1:05:48] where the hundred and forty-four
[1:05:51] thousand are sealed now notice in
[1:05:55] Revelation 9 and four and it was
[1:05:57] commanded them that they should not hurt
[1:05:59] the grass of the earth neither any green
[1:06:01] thing neither any tree but only those
[1:06:04] men which have not the seal of God in
[1:06:07] their foreheads so here again it was it
[1:06:10] was permitted to strike plagues were
[1:06:12] permitted to strike those who didn't
[1:06:14] have the seal again in Revelation 7 this
[1:06:18] is specifically to Israel I saw another
[1:06:20] angel ascending from the east having the
[1:06:23] seal of the Living God and he cried out
[1:06:25] with a loud voice to the four angels to
[1:06:28] whom was given to hurt the earth and to
[1:06:31] the sea saying hurt not the seed neither
[1:06:34] or the earth neither the sea nor the
[1:06:35] trees till we have sealed the servants
[1:06:38] of our God in their foreheads and have
[1:06:41] heard the number of them that were
[1:06:42] sealed and there was sealed a hundred
[1:06:44] and forty and four thousand of all the
[1:06:47] tribes of the children of Israel so you
[1:06:50] can see it is Israel that is being
[1:06:52] sealed it's not it's not the Gentiles
[1:06:56] the Gentiles of course are sealed with
[1:06:58] the Holy Ghost but this is this is a is
[1:07:03] something has happened particularly when
[1:07:06] God has poured out the plagues and so
[1:07:09] when he has pouring out the plagues
[1:07:10] these plagues are from God and when he
[1:07:13] does poured them out upon the earth to
[1:07:16] avenge the death of his servants and
[1:07:19] they the actions and the activities of
[1:07:21] the and and all the all the
[1:07:24] persecution that has been upon the
[1:07:26] Saints through the ages and God pours
[1:07:28] out the vials he's going to protect his
[1:07:31] people but I want you to understand that
[1:07:33] things such as this coronavirus are just
[1:07:37] signs of the end time they're not to be
[1:07:40] confused with the tribulation plagues
[1:07:42] and things will continue to get worse
[1:07:46] amen as the winds of change come and I
[1:07:50] don't doubt that
[1:07:52] that there are some things that are
[1:07:53] never be the same in 911 we gave up lots
[1:07:56] of freedoms here in America no doubt
[1:07:59] we'll do the same again as things are
[1:08:02] tightening they just gave up a lot of
[1:08:03] freedoms in China as things tighten down
[1:08:06] we're closer than ever to the coming of
[1:08:09] the Lord
[1:08:10] and I but I'm not sure that we even know
[1:08:13] how bad things will get you know I don't
[1:08:16] think any of us prediction or thought
[1:08:18] that we'd be speaking to ten or twelve
[1:08:21] people and video streaming to everybody
[1:08:23] else here now quarantine
[1:08:25] you know this changed so very quickly
[1:08:27] and so I just want to remind you you
[1:08:31] know if this if this um drug troubles
[1:08:35] you to the point that you're questioning
[1:08:36] your anchor go get anchored make your
[1:08:40] calling and election sure know where
[1:08:42] you're standing this hour a man because
[1:08:45] Daniel stood by himself and his day you
[1:08:48] can stand remember because you have the
[1:08:51] Holy Ghost in this hour so so we don't
[1:08:54] know how bad things will get but the
[1:08:57] reason I spoke the other day about our
[1:08:59] services becoming a fond memory was not
[1:09:01] to say this is permanent I I'm playing
[1:09:04] the happiest camp in 2021 you know if
[1:09:07] we're still here praise God I hope for
[1:09:10] our next campus in heaven amen
[1:09:13] but but I'll and I hope that that this
[1:09:16] will soon pass and we can meet together
[1:09:18] again as we once did but do you see it
[1:09:23] is a time of desperation as death goes
[1:09:26] through the land and it requires a deep
[1:09:29] sincerity you you must have it to bind
[1:09:33] the serpent amen and make sure that the
[1:09:37] blood is on your doorpost is the only
[1:09:40] thing that can rapture you out of here
[1:09:42] as things get worse because we will
[1:09:45] escape the things that are coming on the
[1:09:47] earth remember this and the hold is for
[1:09:49] your comfort
[1:09:50] Luke chapter 21 verse 32 take heed to
[1:09:53] yourselves lest at any time your hearts
[1:09:57] be overcharged with survives and in
[1:10:01] drunkenness and cares of this life so
[1:10:03] that day
[1:10:04] but when you underwear for as a snare
[1:10:06] shall it come on all them that dwell on
[1:10:08] the face of the whole earth and watching
[1:10:11] therefore and pray always that you may
[1:10:13] be accounted worthy to escape all these
[1:10:17] things that shall come to pass and to
[1:10:20] stand before the Son of man so I want to
[1:10:23] remind you it is a time of Laodicea
[1:10:25] people's hearts are overcharged with
[1:10:27] survives into drunkenness and maybe this
[1:10:30] is a wake-up call for all of us to be in
[1:10:34] stop just for a minute and realize
[1:10:36] what's really really important you know
[1:10:39] as we have been busy about life and over
[1:10:41] charms with with the cares of this life
[1:10:44] and you know to the point it's
[1:10:47] overindulgence which is what survives
[1:10:49] and mean or drunkenness where is not
[1:10:52] just a little wine but we're just
[1:10:55] overtaken by it and the wine of Laodicea
[1:10:59] and thus the slothful Laodicean spirit
[1:11:03] is that to get idioms I'm guarantee you
[1:11:06] when you do get to come back to the
[1:11:08] house of God you'll appreciate and being
[1:11:12] able to come a man rather than saying
[1:11:15] it's just an option I can stay home
[1:11:17] today if I want to or who cares and be a
[1:11:20] because chalice say it not to offend
[1:11:22] anybody but just be a secular Christian
[1:11:24] or our secular Baptists about it I meant
[1:11:28] where it's just an option it'll mean
[1:11:30] something you say well hey this might be
[1:11:33] something important this might be
[1:11:36] something to value now and that when I
[1:11:38] come that I've come and put everything
[1:11:40] that I got into it I meant because this
[1:11:44] is the Bible said whoo that's a snare
[1:11:46] and I pay it this came just like a trap
[1:11:49] he just closed suddenly and then most of
[1:11:52] us wouldn't prepared for it you didn't
[1:11:55] have enough toilet paper
[1:11:57] you know people found themselves in the
[1:12:00] situations and they were unprepared
[1:12:03] but there is it's it's something that we
[1:12:06] should be prepared and man that we
[1:12:09] should be ready cuz we don't know the
[1:12:12] moment that things was quickly changed
[1:12:16] the rapture can take place just like
[1:12:18] that I know I know there are those that
[1:12:21] are say well certain things has got to
[1:12:22] be fulfilled I'm going to show you in
[1:12:24] the scripture today and by the message
[1:12:26] that that that some of those things you
[1:12:29] think it's going to be fulfilled or not
[1:12:31] even applying to the Bride of Christ but
[1:12:34] anyway I want to give you a consolation
[1:12:36] brother branham to use this text to
[1:12:38] preach the rapture from some twenty
[1:12:40] seven and he says the Lord is my light
[1:12:43] and my salvation remember this is
[1:12:45] rapture hour and this is a rapture
[1:12:47] scripture here's my light and my
[1:12:49] salvation we can't look for government's
[1:12:53] to save us we're looking to the Lord to
[1:12:56] save us whom shall I fear or shall I say
[1:12:59] what shall I fear or we can say whom
[1:13:02] shall I fear because this is a devil
[1:13:05] Jesus would call these these diseases
[1:13:08] demons and said thou devil come out of
[1:13:12] them the man or rather the woman that
[1:13:14] spirit of infirmity he would call them
[1:13:17] Devils so this is an angelic war so of
[1:13:21] whom so shall I fear the Lord he is the
[1:13:25] strength of my life of whom shall I be
[1:13:27] afraid when the wicked even mine enemies
[1:13:30] and my foes came upon me to eat my flesh
[1:13:33] they stumbled and fell love that don't
[1:13:37] you don't a host should encamp against
[1:13:40] me that's an army my my heart shall not
[1:13:43] fear the war should rise against me if
[1:13:45] this will not be company one thing I
[1:13:48] have desired of the Lord that I will
[1:13:51] seek after that I may dwell in the house
[1:13:53] of the Lord all the days of my life to
[1:13:56] behold the beauty of the Lord and
[1:13:58] enquire in his temple during the time of
[1:14:01] trouble he will hide me in his pavilion
[1:14:05] that's his tent in the secret of his
[1:14:08] Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[1:14:11] me up on a rock so you know again we we
[1:14:15] want to just take consolation God's got
[1:14:18] this it's in his control and but you
[1:14:22] don't Kim but can we say though like
[1:14:25] some people take these quotes to
[1:14:26] indicate that if we really
[1:14:29] the whole ego seal that we won't get the
[1:14:31] virus
[1:14:32] you don't listen as believers we're not
[1:14:35] immune from sickness or death except
[1:14:38] spiritual death and you know we had we
[1:14:42] had Jacko who was a great man of faith
[1:14:47] he died of polio thirty-eight years old
[1:14:50] polio that he obtained in a prayer line
[1:14:52] William Branham died in the horrendous
[1:14:55] car accident Saints get cancer and other
[1:15:01] diseases as sinners did John the Baptist
[1:15:05] got his head cut off because of a
[1:15:07] drunken woman at a dance calamities
[1:15:10] happened to all mankind believers
[1:15:14] non-believers alike but for there to be
[1:15:18] plagues and only those with the seal of
[1:15:20] God will be protected that's for the
[1:15:22] tribulation when the plagues aren't
[1:15:24] caused by God under the ministry of
[1:15:27] Moses and Elijah and we need to
[1:15:30] understand that before the seals even
[1:15:32] brother to brother Brandon now I want
[1:15:34] you to listen carefully even to brother
[1:15:37] Branham the book was closed it had to be
[1:15:40] open to him you see before that he was
[1:15:44] one who proved that he crawled step
[1:15:46] allama scriptures he had a church view
[1:15:48] on the book of Revelation and even some
[1:15:51] other scriptures and this is what made
[1:15:54] the Bible become a new book to him when
[1:15:56] the seals were open and some of these
[1:15:59] quotes are no different from the ones
[1:16:01] that reverse to the white horse rider of
[1:16:04] the first seal be in Christ we'd never
[1:16:06] preached that we never sinned those
[1:16:08] quotes around Woodley then that that's
[1:16:11] that would be Christ the white horse
[1:16:13] rider of the book of Revelation we
[1:16:16] wouldn't send that around we wouldn't we
[1:16:18] read that we understand the seals
[1:16:20] corrected that right and so we know that
[1:16:23] when the revelation was given it wasn't
[1:16:26] Christ at all it was the Antichrist his
[1:16:28] brother branham said in the verse seal
[1:16:30] he said oh I would absolutely today I
[1:16:33] hope that people are spiritual well I
[1:16:36] would have had made
[1:16:37] horrible mistake hole not big bad been
[1:16:40] for about 12 o'clock today when the Holy
[1:16:42] Spirit came in the room and corrected me
[1:16:44] on something that I was writing down to
[1:16:46] say you see the seals were um a definite
[1:16:51] turning point a corner that was turned
[1:16:54] and brother branham's understanding and
[1:16:56] so must it be for us and I want to say
[1:17:00] so were the trumpets until the Viets of
[1:17:03] the trumpets but the random was still of
[1:17:05] the opinion the bride would go through a
[1:17:07] squeeze of persecution and see a great
[1:17:09] display of power and there are quotes on
[1:17:12] that and later the in the and the Feast
[1:17:15] of the trumpets there and thereafter he
[1:17:17] sees that the bride won't go through
[1:17:20] that time at all you see he clearly
[1:17:23] thought the trumpets was for us and it
[1:17:25] was his job to to reveal him he was
[1:17:27] making plans to preach him he was he had
[1:17:30] meetings that would be set up seven in a
[1:17:32] row where he'd take each one of the
[1:17:34] trumpets and explain them until God
[1:17:37] showed him different you see now that
[1:17:40] was a milestone or marker or injunction
[1:17:43] of time or a corner that was turned in
[1:17:46] his ministry and so there are many of
[1:17:49] these quotes and things that you have to
[1:17:51] judge according to the light that was
[1:17:55] given at that time because God showed
[1:17:59] clarity up on that now here's the
[1:18:02] supporting quote for that in the Feast
[1:18:04] of Trumpets he says oh don't you see
[1:18:06] where we're at
[1:18:07] don't you see why them trumpets and mean
[1:18:09] nothing to us they all sounded under our
[1:18:12] sixth seal you see why the Holy Spirit
[1:18:14] wouldn't let me speak it and the
[1:18:16] Heavenly Father knows for this Bible
[1:18:18] before me that's the truth didn't know
[1:18:21] till yesterday day before yesterday in
[1:18:23] my room there were he revealed it come
[1:18:26] to me and spoke to me and I come back
[1:18:28] and I said wife I got it now he just met
[1:18:31] me in there and told me and here it is
[1:18:33] honey see see it's perfectly in harmony
[1:18:36] old people without him get in quick it
[1:18:39] might be your last opportunity you'll
[1:18:41] ever be able to have you
[1:18:43] don't know what time he might come and
[1:18:46] the reason why he would say that is
[1:18:48] because scriptures that they were
[1:18:51] expecting still to be laying before them
[1:18:53] to be fulfilled had had already been
[1:18:56] realized now they're not even for us and
[1:18:59] we're raptured out of here before that
[1:19:00] time so now search this is very very
[1:19:03] crucial to understand in many of these
[1:19:06] quotes he said I didn't know to
[1:19:08] yesterday or the day before and
[1:19:11] everything so everything before
[1:19:13] mentioned about persecution and plagues
[1:19:16] must be and understood in the light of
[1:19:19] this prophetic understanding now this is
[1:19:23] no different than the white horse rider
[1:19:25] before the seals you you you know you
[1:19:27] you've got to place these things
[1:19:29] correctly like I said we want enforce we
[1:19:33] want to enforce our rights but you don't
[1:19:35] want to try to be making things happen
[1:19:37] that doesn't apply to us you you I want
[1:19:42] you to remember there are two Israel's
[1:19:46] you look at one another and say to
[1:19:48] Israel's there's a natural people and a
[1:19:52] spiritual people and man there's a
[1:19:55] natural seed of Abraham and a royal seed
[1:19:58] of Abraham and there are two groups and
[1:20:01] both of them are God's chosen people and
[1:20:04] the Jews have a natural land of what was
[1:20:06] once called Palestine and the bride has
[1:20:09] a spiritual land of the Holy Ghost and
[1:20:11] what God does with the Jews naturally he
[1:20:15] does with the church spiritually so what
[1:20:18] he's working with naturally what he's
[1:20:20] working with spiritually and the Israel
[1:20:22] for 2,000 years or nearly 2,000 years
[1:20:25] have been out of their homeland and they
[1:20:28] were dispersed and they wandered about
[1:20:30] out into other nations same with the
[1:20:34] church the spiritual application the the
[1:20:37] church was dispersed and wondered about
[1:20:39] not in that nations but in two
[1:20:42] denominations and the the seven trumpets
[1:20:45] call Israel back to their homeland and
[1:20:49] following the trumpets is the Day of
[1:20:51] Atonement
[1:20:52] now while at the likewise the seven
[1:20:58] gospel trumpets by seven churches
[1:21:02] messengers call the bride to the
[1:21:06] atonement so you see each one of them
[1:21:09] have their job one of them's a natural
[1:21:11] one of them the spiritual let's look at
[1:21:14] Leviticus 23:23 and we'll get this I
[1:21:17] think this is very very wonderful he
[1:21:20] says and live in it because 23:23 didn't
[1:21:22] the Lord spoke to Moses saying speak to
[1:21:26] the children of Israel saying in the
[1:21:29] seventh month on the first day of the
[1:21:32] month you shall have a Sabbath rest a
[1:21:34] memorial of blowing of trumpets a holy
[1:21:37] convocation let me stop right there a
[1:21:39] holy convocation
[1:21:41] that's a gathering holy gathering that's
[1:21:44] what that means it's interesting enough
[1:21:47] a gathering of eagles is called a
[1:21:50] convocation
[1:21:52] so where the carcass are gathered are
[1:21:55] the carcasses the eagles are gathered
[1:21:58] and man there's a holy convocation where
[1:22:01] the word is so now again he says in
[1:22:06] verse 25 years have do no customary work
[1:22:09] on it and you shall offer an offering
[1:22:11] made by fire to the Lord
[1:22:13] notice this let's notice particularly
[1:22:16] this was in the seventh month so there
[1:22:20] was the Passover which would happen at
[1:22:23] the beginning of the year and then seven
[1:22:25] months later the feast of the trumpets
[1:22:28] and these seven months also represent to
[1:22:33] us are tied to us seven church ages
[1:22:36] so since Calvary there has been seven
[1:22:39] months or seven church Jesus and we are
[1:22:41] now here at the feast of the trumpets in
[1:22:45] a in a spiritual sense now it is a
[1:22:49] memorial notice what it says ye shall
[1:22:52] have a memorial of blowing of the
[1:22:55] trumpets Leviticus 23:23 a memorial of
[1:22:58] the blowing of trumpet
[1:23:00] now a memorial is to remind people of an
[1:23:05] event a past event that took place right
[1:23:09] so it's a memorial now the Bible didn't
[1:23:13] say what the event was but there was a
[1:23:16] vent where the trumpet blew loud and
[1:23:20] long for their above Mount Sinai at the
[1:23:25] sound of the blowing of the trumpet
[1:23:27] Moses spoke and God answered my Thunder
[1:23:31] and you you have to see this in the
[1:23:34] translations because our King James
[1:23:37] Version doesn't bring it in out exactly
[1:23:39] like that but other translations do so
[1:23:42] so it's bound to be there in the Hebrew
[1:23:45] because other theologians are bringing
[1:23:47] this out said is a he answered by back
[1:23:51] Thunder and so so you see the blowing of
[1:23:55] the trumpet was to bring Israel back to
[1:23:59] remembrance of when the word was given
[1:24:02] to the prophet Moses upon Mount Sinai
[1:24:05] and Moses spoke and God answered by
[1:24:09] Thunder when when the trumpet sounded so
[1:24:12] note the trumpet blows God speaks and
[1:24:15] his voice is like thunders you can find
[1:24:17] this in Exodus 19 and in the book of
[1:24:20] Revelation there are seven trumpets and
[1:24:22] seven thunders and all of them sound
[1:24:25] their voices and each are symbolic of
[1:24:28] something that God is doing on earth hey
[1:24:31] man so now the feast of the trumpets
[1:24:34] happened in the seventh month before the
[1:24:37] Day of Atonement now the day of
[1:24:40] atonement was when Israel the high
[1:24:43] priest would offer an atonement for the
[1:24:45] whole nation a man for all the people to
[1:24:49] be accepted now this seventh month was
[1:24:52] all it was a month of the last harvest
[1:24:54] or the harvest of harvest it would be
[1:24:57] the final harvest of the year remember
[1:24:59] there was a barley harvest set at
[1:25:02] Passover there was the wheat harvest at
[1:25:04] Pentecost and then the last feast of the
[1:25:07] year was the seventh month which
[1:25:10] happened in the fall of the year and
[1:25:12] three feasts on in that month in the
[1:25:16] seventh month was three feasts there was
[1:25:18] the Trumpets the Day of Atonement and
[1:25:20] the Feast of the Tabernacles now of
[1:25:23] course we believe of course that the
[1:25:26] same thing happens for us here in this
[1:25:28] last seventh age a man Daria's the the
[1:25:32] trumpet call back to the word a man
[1:25:35] there is the day of atonement not a new
[1:25:38] atonement but back to the original
[1:25:39] atonement and then the feasts of the
[1:25:42] tabernacle which we wear which is the
[1:25:45] Millennium so where we're coming right
[1:25:46] here at the end of the seventh age
[1:25:49] unsername the Millennium the Feast of
[1:25:52] the Tabernacles were that we will we
[1:25:55] will build houses and another will not
[1:25:57] inhabit because it be temporary
[1:26:00] during that thousand years so that's the
[1:26:02] Feast of Tabernacles was the feast of
[1:26:04] booths where they would take temporary
[1:26:07] little booths they would make of out of
[1:26:10] shrubs and and and brush and whatever
[1:26:13] and make a little tent and sleep outside
[1:26:15] during the Feast of the Tabernacles to
[1:26:17] remember their journey in through the
[1:26:20] wilderness and the millennial reign is
[1:26:23] the Feast of the Tabernacles where that
[1:26:26] we we will dwell live in houses and and
[1:26:30] when another will not inhabit and and so
[1:26:33] on like that and we long enjoy the works
[1:26:35] of our hands and we remember our journey
[1:26:38] ins here upon the earth as we live in
[1:26:41] temporary shelters because then it will
[1:26:44] be burned with fire and the new heavens
[1:26:47] and the new earth will come so you can
[1:26:49] see it lays up perfectly and and it all
[1:26:52] happens here at this last seventh month
[1:26:56] now the seven trumpets of Revelation
[1:27:00] they were to call Israel back to their
[1:27:03] homeland and to the atonement they
[1:27:07] rejected
[1:27:08] now this last days has been the calling
[1:27:11] out time remember this this is the
[1:27:13] calling out time brother Branham would
[1:27:16] place it he said there was the martyr
[1:27:18] time then there was a reformer time
[1:27:21] and now is the calling out time all
[1:27:23] right this is what he's satting pieces
[1:27:25] of the trumpets the martyr time we don't
[1:27:29] fulfill that hey man the reformer time
[1:27:34] we don't fool the well that the calling
[1:27:37] out time that's where we're we're
[1:27:40] fulfilling all right so he sells in the
[1:27:42] pieces of the trumpets pair up 331 231
[1:27:46] now here is the calling out time at the
[1:27:49] sixth seal one opened the persecution
[1:27:51] struck the Jews in the literal
[1:27:54] standpoint here comes the persecution to
[1:27:57] the church in the ecclesiastical
[1:27:59] standpoint because the bride's already
[1:28:01] called the Sabbath's are over 1 because
[1:28:04] we're at the end of the Sabbath the
[1:28:06] seventh Church ages we're here as we've
[1:28:09] been explained in the seventh month all
[1:28:11] of the sevens are being fulfilled and
[1:28:13] ready for the Jews we call where to the
[1:28:16] feast of atonement Oh church don't you
[1:28:19] see that call to the feast of atonement
[1:28:20] what to recognize the atonement listen
[1:28:24] close not no more chickens and geese and
[1:28:27] what they've been doing
[1:28:28] but the Lamb of God slain before the
[1:28:31] foundation soil is Allah know that now
[1:28:34] remember this is the original atonement
[1:28:37] the Lamb of God a map so again this is
[1:28:43] what they are going to be pointed to no
[1:28:45] more chickens and geese he says when we
[1:28:48] can all say well it was never chicken
[1:28:50] and geese well it might as well been a
[1:28:53] member for they had no atonement since
[1:28:57] they rejected the atonement at Calvary
[1:28:59] since they had rejected God's lamb well
[1:29:03] they definitely have a temple they don't
[1:29:05] even have place to worship except their
[1:29:08] synagogues it's not is not work God told
[1:29:11] him to worship a man is not where the
[1:29:13] temple was and then they've not been
[1:29:16] able to offer a lamb they can't even
[1:29:18] they can't even do the the red heifer
[1:29:21] all of their all the things if they if
[1:29:23] it requires a blood sacrifice those
[1:29:26] people are lost in fact all the world is
[1:29:32] lost that don't accept a blood sacrifice
[1:29:35] and even those in the message today that
[1:29:37] say he's no longer the bloody sacrifice
[1:29:39] you're lost because without that bloody
[1:29:42] sacrifice you had no hope so you see he
[1:29:46] again no it wasn't chicken and geese but
[1:29:49] it might as well have been they they
[1:29:51] have had no atonement since they
[1:29:53] rejected the atonement at Calvary and
[1:29:56] for spiritual Israel the bride the piece
[1:30:00] of the trumpet represents to us you know
[1:30:03] something something you know the
[1:30:06] spiritual Israel it represents the seven
[1:30:09] gospel trumpets that had blown under the
[1:30:13] seven messengers calling the bride of
[1:30:16] every age to the atonement and when the
[1:30:19] seventh angel the last church aids
[1:30:22] messenger sounds his trumpet this gospel
[1:30:26] message on the last day of the feast
[1:30:29] then we come back to the original
[1:30:32] atonement the same Holy Ghost that was
[1:30:37] given at the beginning any man again
[1:30:41] some of this that has been offered for
[1:30:43] atonement it is not better than offering
[1:30:45] the chickens and geese you see it was it
[1:30:49] was not the Holy Ghost of leather the
[1:30:51] Covenant but rather man-made traditions
[1:30:54] of shaking hands with the preacher or
[1:30:57] joining church or some Roman ritual
[1:31:00] that's that's that's my offering chicken
[1:31:03] and geese hey man it's it means nothing
[1:31:06] it will not save you a man some Romans
[1:31:10] ritual or tradition will not save you a
[1:31:14] man even some of this sin is being
[1:31:16] offered this almost nice religion this
[1:31:19] this our religion without experience it
[1:31:22] will not say and it doesn't deliver and
[1:31:25] it's like an atonement of chicken and
[1:31:28] geese imagines we're not having a
[1:31:30] totally hey man but I tell you God has
[1:31:34] brought us back to the original
[1:31:36] atonement which is the baptism of the
[1:31:39] Holy Ghost the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:31:42] coming in spirit form now brother
[1:31:45] Branham says
[1:31:46] hey pair up to 91 now is the same as the
[1:31:49] two prophets did remember that Gentile
[1:31:52] bride is to have a prophet called Elias
[1:31:55] Elijah that is to call them out of their
[1:31:58] traditions the bride just the same as
[1:32:02] these prophets call the Jews out of
[1:32:04] Judaism to Christ the atonement and the
[1:32:07] Gentiles already know the atonement but
[1:32:10] is called the bride back to the original
[1:32:12] atonement and what was the original I
[1:32:14] told me it was the baptism of the Holy
[1:32:17] Ghost that came on the day of Pentecost
[1:32:19] that's where the blood was applied hey
[1:32:22] man the lamb was shed at Calvary his
[1:32:25] blood but it was applied at Pentecost
[1:32:27] and 120 were born of the blood of God
[1:32:30] are you with me so so again it brings
[1:32:34] the bride back to the original atonement
[1:32:37] so just as they have a prophet or two
[1:32:40] prophets to call them out of Jewish
[1:32:43] traditions back to the teratoma so God
[1:32:46] sent a prophet in this day to call us
[1:32:48] out of the tradition of the ideas of the
[1:32:52] church ages and bring us back to the
[1:32:54] original baptism of the Holy Ghost with
[1:32:57] the same power the same war times the
[1:32:59] same wondered that he did back there
[1:33:02] hallelujah so you see it is to call us
[1:33:06] back as Gentile people back to the true
[1:33:09] atonement by a prophet to a holy
[1:33:13] gathering to a convocation amen back to
[1:33:17] the word a call back to word to the word
[1:33:20] to remember the original word and the
[1:33:24] original atonement that was given not
[1:33:26] about Sinai but at Pentecost hallelujah
[1:33:30] because that's where the word came to be
[1:33:32] written in the heart was not there at
[1:33:34] Mount Sinai but here at Pentecost and
[1:33:37] this message brings us right back to the
[1:33:39] Pentecostal father's one more time
[1:33:44] hallelujah back to the original
[1:33:47] atonement a man the original word
[1:33:51] original atonement the trumpets are
[1:33:55] something that have been overlooked and
[1:33:58] hasn't been spoken about a lot but since
[1:34:02] we're in these trouble sometimes it's
[1:34:05] important to look some of these things
[1:34:07] over really good because whole sermons
[1:34:11] have been preached for years of a common
[1:34:13] squeeze and the bride's persecution and
[1:34:17] the belief that the power of the word is
[1:34:19] delayed until the squeeze comes but but
[1:34:24] don't we understand that it's this great
[1:34:28] junction of the Feast of the trumpets
[1:34:31] brother brother Branham tells us the
[1:34:33] pressure that comes upon the bride is
[1:34:36] not in a physical manner it's in an
[1:34:40] ecclesiastical manner now ecclesiastical
[1:34:45] manner means by preachers by doctrines
[1:34:50] of the church and that causes a squeeze
[1:34:54] on the people
[1:34:57] are you with me squeezing out what
[1:35:00] squeezing out the gifts of the Spirit
[1:35:03] squeezing out speaking in tongues
[1:35:06] squeezing out in banning divine healing
[1:35:10] discouraging prayer lines don't want
[1:35:13] altar calls anymore even worship don't
[1:35:16] want spiritual worship anymore you see
[1:35:19] and I want you to understand
[1:35:22] that's the please see a circle squeeze
[1:35:25] and my brother bottom makes it clear in
[1:35:29] the Feast of Trumpets that the bride
[1:35:31] receives her persecution in an
[1:35:34] ecclesiastical manner this is this whole
[1:35:39] thing you know where summer rose up
[1:35:41] against our worship and I praise unto
[1:35:43] the Lord it's nothing more than an
[1:35:46] ecclesiastical squeeze trying to
[1:35:49] pressure us not to have the
[1:35:51] movement of the Holy Ghost in our midst
[1:35:53] that God working among us are you with
[1:35:57] me man so you see this queasy obstacle
[1:36:01] squeeze banzi anointing it bands the
[1:36:04] gifts of the Spirit it discourages and
[1:36:07] prohibits speaking in tongues and divine
[1:36:10] healings and prayer lines and altar
[1:36:12] calls and worship and again I just say
[1:36:15] like I said last Sunday if this is the
[1:36:17] virus we need to be worried about
[1:36:19] because you don't just bring physic it's
[1:36:22] not just physical there's a spiritual
[1:36:24] death now the church talking about not
[1:36:34] the bride the church will go through a
[1:36:36] time of tribulation but not the bride
[1:36:39] let me share a few little quotations to
[1:36:44] support these in the tired church age
[1:36:47] page 228 so let me say right here then
[1:36:52] we have the very same thing going on
[1:36:53] right now people all come together
[1:36:55] they're right in the Bible that will
[1:36:57] suit everyone whether it be Jew or
[1:36:59] Catholic or Protestant and they have
[1:37:02] their own Nicean counsel but they call
[1:37:04] it the ecumenical council and do you
[1:37:07] know what and you know who all these
[1:37:10] organizations fight they fight the true
[1:37:14] Pentecostals I don't mean organization
[1:37:17] called Pentecostals I mean the ones who
[1:37:19] are Pentecostal because they're filled
[1:37:22] with the Holy Ghost and have the signs
[1:37:24] and gifts and in their myths because
[1:37:26] they walk in truth so notice what he
[1:37:30] says here these organizations are listen
[1:37:32] it's an ecclesiastical spirit see we've
[1:37:34] been looking for a long time for the
[1:37:36] ecumenical council to come in and close
[1:37:39] our churches and some are saying oh this
[1:37:41] is it this is it
[1:37:42] yes Nadia it's a virus it's the
[1:37:46] government giving a recommendation amens
[1:37:50] now they're not yet prohibited religion
[1:37:52] if they're just giving recommendations
[1:37:56] are you with me and so it's not physical
[1:38:00] but it's you see this this ekam you
[1:38:02] Camus you see that in your among all
[1:38:06] your people that your work with your
[1:38:08] associate
[1:38:08] everybody's at communica minded you
[1:38:11] can't say anything everything's got to
[1:38:13] be politically correct you know and you
[1:38:15] you dare not you you know if you you
[1:38:18] dare not stand for the word of God your
[1:38:20] just mental right you can't stand for
[1:38:26] truth you're judgmental you're
[1:38:28] immediately they kick you out you can't
[1:38:30] say anything about sin you can't say
[1:38:34] anything about you know what is wrong
[1:38:36] that bisexual is wrong and homosexual is
[1:38:40] wrong and this other other sentence or
[1:38:42] room can't say that no more what is that
[1:38:44] it's the squeeze and everybody is got to
[1:38:50] be accepted what is it it's the squeeze
[1:38:53] it's coming in an ecclesiastical manner
[1:38:57] trying to shut us down trying to shut
[1:39:04] your witness down your testimony down
[1:39:07] even what we preach from the pulpit down
[1:39:11] are you with me Amen they fight the true
[1:39:15] Pentecostals I don't mean the
[1:39:17] organizational call Pentecost I mean the
[1:39:20] ones are Pentecostal cuz they've been
[1:39:22] filled with the Holy Ghost and have
[1:39:24] signs and gifts in their myths because
[1:39:26] they walk in truth
[1:39:29] come on they're the same thing that is
[1:39:32] happening there just like they would
[1:39:33] take but the Star of David upon the upon
[1:39:37] the Jews and and they're the one and
[1:39:39] they made that a sign of disgust come on
[1:39:44] they're very very sign of their ancient
[1:39:47] heritage a King David and his kingdom
[1:39:50] they turned it have made it a sign of
[1:39:52] disgust distrust hate it brought them
[1:40:01] down to the death camps and that's what
[1:40:04] they want to do on you is pin on your
[1:40:05] label Pentecostal
[1:40:09] oh you're you're just a Pentecost let me
[1:40:13] well you know your your Pentecost cuz
[1:40:16] you shout well what about it if you
[1:40:18] don't chatter you Baptists and my or
[1:40:23] your Macedon so you Catholic what are
[1:40:25] you a man but but again you know it's
[1:40:30] it's it's like pitting on you a dirty
[1:40:32] name now the calling of Pentecost what
[1:40:36] we are to Pentecost hey man we're not
[1:40:39] the organisation Pentecost I mean the
[1:40:41] ones who are Pentecostal because they're
[1:40:43] filled with the Holy Ghost and they got
[1:40:45] signs and gifts in their myths because
[1:40:48] they walk in truth but you see some will
[1:40:51] protests but brother Tim we we just got
[1:40:54] to have this persecution
[1:40:56] in order to drive this together to bring
[1:40:58] on the power for the rapture you know we
[1:41:00] we we can we we gotta have rapture in
[1:41:03] faith and so you know listen listen to
[1:41:06] some of these quotes so this is pre that
[1:41:09] pre trumpets again brother Brandon said
[1:41:12] how we going to lose this great race
[1:41:13] this isn't a paradox 1964 April the 18th
[1:41:19] is because we're divided how we going to
[1:41:22] do it we're going to stay to get we got
[1:41:24] to stay together we're all believers in
[1:41:26] God the Holy Ghost takes us all in it'll
[1:41:29] be a paradox if God ever gets us
[1:41:32] together but he will just trust him that
[1:41:38] virgin birth he knows how to send the
[1:41:42] persecution that will run us together in
[1:41:49] a court trial again in April 64 brother
[1:41:53] Branham preached his Feast of Trumpets
[1:41:55] in July of 64 and you said this this is
[1:42:00] where I knew all the Pentecostals groups
[1:42:02] come together then it'll take a
[1:42:04] persecution to run you people together
[1:42:07] you'll never believe it but when that
[1:42:09] time comes
[1:42:11] well you don't that makes some assume
[1:42:14] well the Bobby change is an imminent
[1:42:16] then and it can't take place until we're
[1:42:19] persecuted
[1:42:20] and we gotta have the squeeze so we can
[1:42:23] do miracles and then brother will have
[1:42:26] will have power then and brother
[1:42:28] then we'll have rapture in faith and I
[1:42:30] want to just say to you we already got
[1:42:32] the power you have a seat power after
[1:42:36] the Holy Ghost is come upon you that's
[1:42:39] what gives you power
[1:42:40] not persecution amen you see we have the
[1:42:46] power the message has come and it's
[1:42:49] given us the faith for the rapture a man
[1:42:53] it struck up over claim that was against
[1:42:56] us and gave us the extract of title
[1:43:00] somebody with me right now
[1:43:02] a man so you see you see this message is
[1:43:06] rapture and faith it is what gives us
[1:43:10] the revelation for the rapture in it
[1:43:13] it illuminates the scriptures that
[1:43:15] pertain to us don't you see what I'm
[1:43:17] talking about
[1:43:21] I've often used this example and maybe
[1:43:24] this illustration will help somebody but
[1:43:28] there's some of you that were caught in
[1:43:30] marriage situations horrible situation
[1:43:34] some of you married to three times
[1:43:36] living with a man that wasn't you know
[1:43:38] your husband he's and he had two or
[1:43:40] three wives and so on like that and you
[1:43:43] were in horrible shape
[1:43:45] well how could you go in the rapture you
[1:43:49] know I mean you are you were in a mess
[1:43:54] but God through the open and those seals
[1:43:57] revealed to us that that has been
[1:44:01] forgiven don't go do it again well that
[1:44:06] gives that divorce cup of faith they can
[1:44:09] go in the rapture yep they're living
[1:44:12] together and they would have been living
[1:44:14] an adulterer but God gave him permission
[1:44:17] to live together and still go in the
[1:44:20] rapture
[1:44:20] you see rapture and faith lays in the
[1:44:25] message somebody with me a man so here
[1:44:30] again this is really important that we
[1:44:33] this gives us faith the message gives us
[1:44:37] faith for the rapture now I want to see
[1:44:40] and I want to say that persecution did
[1:44:46] run the true Pentecostals together this
[1:44:53] ecclesiastical persecution did drive
[1:44:56] true Pentecostals together we came out
[1:44:59] of denominations we fled into the land
[1:45:03] of the Holy Ghost where the word has
[1:45:05] preeminence and right here in this
[1:45:09] church right it evening like Tavenner we
[1:45:11] got Baptists and Methodists and Catholic
[1:45:14] and Pentecostals all those two
[1:45:17] Pentecostals that were out there in
[1:45:19] those denominations somebody listening
[1:45:21] to me a man who have escaped the
[1:45:24] concentration camps of organized
[1:45:27] religion where you were skin and bones
[1:45:30] and on condition and made to work in
[1:45:34] their organization for your salvation
[1:45:37] are you with me but you escaped and you
[1:45:40] have been pushed out of your former
[1:45:43] church homes just like the Jews were
[1:45:46] pushed out of Germany and Italy and
[1:45:48] their homeland for years and years and
[1:45:51] persecution ecclesiastical persecution
[1:45:55] because you couldn't hear the word
[1:45:56] preached there drove you out
[1:46:02] God forced you out of there
[1:46:04] they just got worse and worse and worse
[1:46:07] till you fled the third Exodus brother
[1:46:12] Branham says it this way in this prayer
[1:46:13] Heavenly Father we look we by faith will
[1:46:17] look toward the future I'm looking now
[1:46:19] by faith towards that coming something
[1:46:21] Lord upon the earth that's going to draw
[1:46:25] that people together we see the
[1:46:28] denominational churches so pitting down
[1:46:31] and getting so different it's it's
[1:46:34] really pushing the people out just like
[1:46:37] it was in Egypt but Pharaoh Rison who
[1:46:39] knew not Joseph as it was in Germany and
[1:46:43] up in the Russia and Italy and the
[1:46:46] people raised up doses and Hitler and
[1:46:49] Stalin and Mussolini who hated the Jews
[1:46:53] and they had to go back to their
[1:46:55] homeland God you got ways of doing
[1:46:56] things we don't understand you press
[1:46:59] them no home and Germany everything
[1:47:01] taken from them remember this is a
[1:47:03] natural Israel and also an Italy and
[1:47:06] Russia no place to go and they were sent
[1:47:08] back to their homeland
[1:47:10] just to fulfill the Word of God and man
[1:47:13] oh the lemon hand of God how sometimes
[1:47:17] it looks cruel the way that people
[1:47:19] suffer but still it's the tender hand of
[1:47:23] Jehovah Lina's children we thank you
[1:47:26] Lord now God as I see the day that
[1:47:29] denominations watts now that
[1:47:31] ecclesiastical spirit that denomination
[1:47:33] is pressing the believers
[1:47:36] excommunicating them saying that their
[1:47:39] name must be upon their book or their
[1:47:41] loss have nothing to do with the other
[1:47:43] group it's only the tender hand of
[1:47:46] Jehovah leading them to the tree of life
[1:47:49] I pray God that each one I know they
[1:47:53] will because it's your word it can't
[1:47:55] fail and made me led to the tree of life
[1:47:57] that we might be a possessor of eternal
[1:48:00] life and see the hand of God and by the
[1:48:03] eyes of faith look beyond these shadows
[1:48:06] that we're walking in today and see the
[1:48:08] promised land just ahead so you see it
[1:48:13] did I mean when you look at that it's
[1:48:16] gonna take persecution to drive us
[1:48:18] together it did it's already happened
[1:48:22] hey man it's already driven us to the
[1:48:25] word it's already driven us to our
[1:48:27] homeland it's already placed us in a
[1:48:29] position but for the Jews it took
[1:48:35] natural force for us it took an
[1:48:38] ecclesiastical force you wanted to hear
[1:48:41] this word Amen now in question answers
[1:48:47] number 1 in 64 brother branham's asks a
[1:48:51] question brother branham would the bride
[1:48:52] go through the persecution as an early
[1:48:55] up apostolic church didn't know
[1:48:57] I just explained that a few minutes ago
[1:48:59] no the next thing is a rapture now
[1:49:03] remember we're at the promised land
[1:49:05] we're at the border you understand the
[1:49:07] marks of Israel a man in the fifth seal
[1:49:11] explains and then there he explains on
[1:49:15] Petrov 433 and so on he said I was just
[1:49:19] thinking about how that John saw you
[1:49:24] know so that group he saw his brethren
[1:49:27] he saw the souls under the altar he saw
[1:49:31] the 144,000 he recognized all of them
[1:49:34] don't salute his brethren right and a
[1:49:36] man and this is his brother that had to
[1:49:39] suffer a little while he solved them
[1:49:41] there and he said him to think the Lord
[1:49:43] God permitted me to see my brethren and
[1:49:47] the Saints that were waiting for the
[1:49:49] coming of the Lord
[1:49:50] notice they're not under the altar of
[1:49:52] sacrifice
[1:49:53] man 1 but these was they were martyred
[1:49:56] mine wasn't under the martyrs altar so
[1:50:01] God chose brother Branham his group is
[1:50:04] not under the martyrs altar now that
[1:50:08] doesn't mean there won't be persecuted
[1:50:10] people here are persecuted there in this
[1:50:13] world we have persecution I'm not in the
[1:50:16] different foreign lands of different
[1:50:18] places or different laws and whatever
[1:50:20] and they they've been under persecution
[1:50:23] for years and years it's nothing new but
[1:50:28] understand that bride is a whole don't
[1:50:30] go through that time she is saying that
[1:50:33] she's not under the martyrs altar if I
[1:50:37] could just give some hope even to some
[1:50:39] Chinese people today
[1:50:41] a man there there's some hope right
[1:50:43] there to you that we're we're not part
[1:50:46] of the mountain the martyrs although
[1:50:50] some of you may be murdered but that's
[1:50:52] not what we're all called to be
[1:50:55] understand that a man so that gives you
[1:50:58] that gives you some hope it gives us
[1:51:00] hope that we won't go through the
[1:51:02] tribulation ahead where people give
[1:51:04] their lives
[1:51:05] this gospel but right now you give your
[1:51:08] life for this gospel you live your life
[1:51:11] for a man you can pour out of sacrifice
[1:51:15] and then you leave the things of the
[1:51:17] world you do what is right it's a
[1:51:20] sacrifice hey man
[1:51:23] some of you some of you are sitting back
[1:51:25] you know watching your brother's your
[1:51:28] sisters go through the sacrifice and the
[1:51:30] persecution and you you want to be
[1:51:32] exempt from it so you cut your hair and
[1:51:34] you paint your face and then you live
[1:51:36] like the world I want to say shame on
[1:51:38] you while others are dying for this
[1:51:40] truth or should I say living for this
[1:51:44] truth because that's what we're doing
[1:51:47] right now it's living for it amen
[1:51:51] in the Feast of the trumpets brother
[1:51:54] Branham said he said as soon as this
[1:51:56] church the bride is gathered together
[1:51:58] she'd be taken up in that mystery of
[1:52:00] this seventh seal or the seventh seal
[1:52:03] the mystery of going in the turret the
[1:52:06] Jews is called by the mystery of the
[1:52:07] seventh trumpet which is the two
[1:52:10] prophets Elijah and Moses and they come
[1:52:13] they come back and there's where the
[1:52:15] Pentecostals is all mixed up they're
[1:52:18] looking for something to happen and the
[1:52:20] church has done gone and that's to the
[1:52:23] Jews so you see some even a message are
[1:52:27] still Pentecostal or Church world
[1:52:31] religion in their thinking because they
[1:52:35] haven't turned the corner with the
[1:52:38] Prophet and man and they're all mixed up
[1:52:41] and they're preaching when we gotta go
[1:52:44] through persecution or we you know
[1:52:47] what's out where we're gonna be shut
[1:52:48] down and here comes the squeezin and
[1:52:51] this houses in an ecclesiastical manner
[1:53:02] brother Branham is asked for the bride
[1:53:04] before Jesus comes this is again
[1:53:07] question answer is 164 when the bride
[1:53:12] before Jesus comes will she raise have
[1:53:15] all the power the Holy Ghost performed
[1:53:17] miracles raise the dead and so
[1:53:19] as in the latter Ranger is the laddering
[1:53:20] for the hundred forty-four thousand
[1:53:22] years or well all ministers have this
[1:53:24] are we just waiting for they come in and
[1:53:26] he says yes then he says friends I'm not
[1:53:32] a theologian and I got to teach
[1:53:34] everything I know by the times and he
[1:53:37] said you can call me a typology he said
[1:53:40] if I see my shadow of my hand he said I
[1:53:44] can see you know I get a glimpse of
[1:53:46] what's coming and he said is God dealt
[1:53:48] with Abraham that's the way that God's
[1:53:50] gonna deal with the church excuse me so
[1:53:54] he said you look at the Stations of
[1:53:57] Abraham's life he comes like and he
[1:54:00] types it from Luther to wesley own down
[1:54:02] on down he said he confirmed the this to
[1:54:07] him to shed blood the villa Delphian age
[1:54:09] and then that was a bloody age the
[1:54:11] Wesleyan age and he said watch the
[1:54:13] Pentecostal age that he made the promise
[1:54:16] of el-shaddai I nursed from me and the
[1:54:19] question is can you nurse and he said
[1:54:22] that was brought before the Pentecostals
[1:54:25] and they grabbed for their abreast of
[1:54:26] denomination where they came out of but
[1:54:29] he said then the real seed that comes to
[1:54:31] nurse on the breast now what he's doing
[1:54:33] is typing it the Pentecostals with Hagar
[1:54:36] and Ishmael a wild seed because he go
[1:54:40] right back into denominations so he says
[1:54:44] you know they were offered the breasts
[1:54:48] of el-shaddai I they were offered the
[1:54:49] full promise of the word but instead
[1:54:52] they took the breasts of a denomination
[1:54:54] and took their evidence that the Holy
[1:54:57] Ghost is speaking in tongues but then
[1:55:00] there comes a real seat which is Isaac
[1:55:02] who will nurse on the breasts now in
[1:55:04] other words who will take the word and
[1:55:06] he said what was the last sign before
[1:55:09] the promised son that they waited on all
[1:55:11] these years come back was God standing
[1:55:13] in the form of man could discern the
[1:55:15] thoughts of was in Sarah's heart Sarah
[1:55:17] being the church represent the church to
[1:55:19] represent and discerned the thoughts is
[1:55:21] in the church that was even behind him
[1:55:23] immediately after that she's changed to
[1:55:25] a young man our young woman in him a
[1:55:27] young man and Isaac was brought on the
[1:55:29] scene the promise
[1:55:30] I believe you are seeing the last thing
[1:55:34] that happened to the church before the
[1:55:37] rapture
[1:55:38] I believe it the rain is over in other
[1:55:40] words the final rain has come this
[1:55:43] message is the latter rain so people are
[1:55:49] looking for great power it's here
[1:55:51] hey man it's here it's I'll tell you
[1:55:54] most of time is untapped resources but
[1:55:58] it's because you let the doors accretes

[1:58:52] in a prophet he's got to be in Bride
[1:58:53] form it moves from from the south to the
[1:58:58] voice and the shout it was a brothers
[1:59:00] message but this phase of his coming is
[1:59:02] the bride coming she's the voice of the
[1:59:05] resurrection I'm the first one that
[1:59:07] raised from the dead after 2,000 years
[1:59:10] we come out of DOC denominationalism
[1:59:12] back to the full word again
[1:59:16] he said you notice the other day when we
[1:59:19] started him trumpets all his spirit said
[1:59:21] that don't belong here he sent in a
[1:59:24] latter rain 144,000 you know that isn't
[1:59:27] that's when the lives of Moses that's
[1:59:28] where that's where the miracles take
[1:59:30] place the things
[1:59:32] the people has been looking for for
[1:59:34] Pentecostal for miracles that'll take
[1:59:36] place that's under them
[1:59:39] see that's the lives of Moses they'll
[1:59:42] smite the earth with curses often as
[1:59:43] well they're closer heavens that it
[1:59:45] don't rain the days of their prophecy
[1:59:46] God will Fightin's stand and fight for
[1:59:49] them like he did he'll bring them out of
[1:59:51] their mighty hand just like he did in
[1:59:53] Egypt on these isms of the world he'll
[1:59:55] do that he'll stop the plagues among
[1:59:58] them like he did in Goshen hey man he
[2:00:02] doesn't stop all the plagues that comes
[2:00:04] here why because he expects you with

[2:00:19] weight on the come to the Lord keep your

[2:00:30] sing that song we're watching for the
[2:00:32] coming of that glad millennial day when
[2:00:35] our Blessed Lord shall come and catch
[2:00:37] his waiting bride away
[2:00:39] no see Church this is what we're to look
[2:00:42] for we're to look and expect the coming
[2:00:45] of the Lord so it can happen yet you're
[2:00:49] wrong if it is happening I'm out they
[2:00:54] asked him again if standing in line to
[2:00:57] get in the church is going to be only a
[2:00:59] memory because brother Brendan said you
[2:01:01] know doing what you're doing now and
[2:01:03] trying to come in the church and stand
[2:01:05] in line
[2:01:05] one day folks this will just be a memory
[2:01:08] and they said it's just gonna be a
[2:01:11] memory what's going to happen if we're
[2:01:13] not going through the tribulation or
[2:01:15] we're gonna be seeing some suffering if
[2:01:17] we're not and he says look these people
[2:01:21] are wanted say thinking the church is
[2:01:23] going to hit the tribulation because but
[2:01:27] he said it won't cause it's already been
[2:01:29] redeemed
[2:01:30] he said now the church the nominal
[2:01:32] believers like lot he's going to go
[2:01:34] through the tribulation be saved as it
[2:01:37] was by fireman Noah went through the
[2:01:38] tribulation period carried above it and
[2:01:41] came out with ham loop
[2:01:43] there's again a lot came out his own
[2:01:45] daughter slept with him and had children
[2:01:47] by his own daughters but Abraham brought
[2:01:50] forth the royal sea broke foot the seed
[2:01:53] of the promise and Enoch went to glory
[2:01:56] and the rapture just took a walk and
[2:01:58] went home he never went through the
[2:02:01] tribulation period hallelujah and in
[2:02:05] mind anemic sir type the seventh from
[2:02:07] Adam those in the seventh church age
[2:02:09] you're gonna be changed in a moment in a
[2:02:11] twinkling of an eye hey man me think
[2:02:16] wasn't persecuted so he can be changed
[2:02:18] he didn't have to go through persecution
[2:02:20] so he can be changed he walked with God
[2:02:22] so he can be changed and that's our duty
[2:02:25] keep your lamps trimmed stay steady
[2:02:27] don't don't don't get discouraged in
[2:02:30] this hour keep your eyes on the goal
[2:02:32] keep your eyes on Jesus otherwise those
[2:02:34] forms to take it but the church will go
[2:02:39] through the tribulation but not the
[2:02:41] bride and they then he said I don't pay
[2:02:44] and this is paragraph 232 and questions
[2:02:47] answers to now people say well what
[2:02:49] about the early Saints that was the
[2:02:51] change in the dispensation that was
[2:02:53] under persecution which of you here this
[2:02:55] church ages and to see they went out
[2:02:58] into darkness and having to do that it
[2:03:00] shows where they had to take that
[2:03:01] persecution because each of the church
[2:03:04] ages and everything began to show that
[2:03:06] went into darker and darker see the
[2:03:08] brides of that age did go through
[2:03:10] persecution so there what finally in
[2:03:12] complete place they denied his name
[2:03:15] picked up another name they lived or
[2:03:17] dead Sardis and they come on ties that
[2:03:19] tire of Sardis and came out came to let
[2:03:21] Philadelphia known well and so forth and
[2:03:24] then come to the car of the time of the
[2:03:27] calling out of the bride which was to
[2:03:30] escape all the damnation
[2:03:33] it's accounted worthy just gave all this
[2:03:36] damnation and wrath that should come
[2:03:38] upon the earth that you might be counted
[2:03:40] worthy to escape it not go through it
[2:03:43] escape it see do you understand now
[2:03:46] everybody so you again you know they
[2:03:49] there were a lot of tribulation they
[2:03:52] were the bride in the dark
[2:03:53] ages and they a tribulation was their
[2:03:55] allotment but we're not in the barter
[2:03:58] time these are we have the reformer time
[2:04:02] we're in the calling out time were the
[2:04:06] trumpet calls the gospel trumpet calls
[2:04:10] us back to the original atonement now
[2:04:16] hope you still got plenty time for
[2:04:19] dinner
[2:04:19] let's go on just a little more I want
[2:04:23] you to see and question answers number
[2:04:25] two he was asked where the foolish
[2:04:28] virgin be saved and he's now what
[2:04:31] happens happens now after that she's in
[2:04:35] the state and of course you know the
[2:04:36] state
[2:04:37] he doesn't finished it here but he this
[2:04:39] felt his filthy still he this Holies
[2:04:40] holy still now she will have to go
[2:04:43] through the tribulation and the reason
[2:04:45] of it is because she rejected the
[2:04:49] atonement in its fullness see they
[2:04:53] reject that took shaken hands I believe
[2:04:55] on Christ this is a sacrifice but they
[2:04:58] didn't take the fullness of the
[2:05:00] atonement which is the true baptism of
[2:05:04] the Holy Ghost and so therefore they
[2:05:08] didn't come and to receive the true
[2:05:10] atonement in as full as she is a
[2:05:12] believer a professed believer but she'll
[2:05:15] have to go through the tribulation
[2:05:16] period the Bible said in the rest of
[2:05:18] them
[2:05:18] the Dragons past burned it out water out
[2:05:21] of his mouth to go and make war and what
[2:05:23] an hour that is and that is of course
[2:05:26] the last verses of revelation 11 I
[2:05:29] believe it is now so she she rejects the
[2:05:34] atonement in his fullness and goes into
[2:05:38] the tribulation period peace the trumpet
[2:05:40] he said now here is the calling out time
[2:05:43] the sixth seal when it's opened
[2:05:44] persecution struck the Jews in the
[2:05:47] lintel standpoint and comes a
[2:05:48] persecution to the church in the
[2:05:50] ecclesiastical standpoint because the
[2:05:53] bride is already called so this
[2:05:55] ecclesiastical persecution drove the
[2:05:58] bride out of denomination
[2:06:01] but the ecclesiastical persecution oh
[2:06:05] yeah
[2:06:06] drove that the ecclesiastical listen
[2:06:09] closely the ecclesiastical persecution
[2:06:11] drove the bride out of the nomination
[2:06:14] but the ecclesiastical persecution
[2:06:17] drives the church into the tribulation
[2:06:20] and then it turns physical so you see
[2:06:30] the pressure is on everybody
[2:06:32] ecclesiastical its own the bride and the
[2:06:38] church of the bride it forces our back
[2:06:41] the word to the rest of them it pushes
[2:06:45] them into concentration camps and and
[2:06:47] their safety believing and Baptist
[2:06:49] Methodist Presbyterian Catholic
[2:06:51] organizations and they wind up in the
[2:06:54] tribulation where it turns physical
[2:06:59] would you like to see that let's look at
[2:07:03] revelation 11 and the last couple of
[2:07:05] verses there if you will please let's
[2:07:11] let's just see revelation is it 11 okay
[2:07:20] I mean this look real quick real quick
[2:07:23] where we talking about the remnant of
[2:07:26] the woman's seed that's Revelation 12
[2:07:29] isn't the last the last verses okay yeah
[2:07:33] and so in in Revelation 12 and verse 17
[2:07:40] what's now and the dragon was wroth with
[2:07:43] the woman and went to make war with the
[2:07:46] remnant of her seed which keep the
[2:07:48] commandments of God and have the
[2:07:49] testimony of Jesus Christ
[2:07:51] so you see then war is made against the
[2:07:55] foolish virgin and there's a multitude
[2:07:57] of them in Revelation 7 that have washed
[2:08:00] their robes in the blood the lamb the
[2:08:02] maid the white and they come up out of
[2:08:04] Great Tribulation
[2:08:05] now listen brother Branham he says now
[2:08:08] I'm going to say something is recognized
[2:08:10] in your day in this message right after
[2:08:12] Feast of Trumpets
[2:08:13] national force but Israel and our
[2:08:15] homeland national voice will put the
[2:08:18] church in the World Council of Churches
[2:08:19] but the power of God will put people in
[2:08:22] the bride the world forces this way the
[2:08:25] world forces that would but God forces
[2:08:27] upward and the Spirit of God which is a
[2:08:30] Word of God my spirit as my word of
[2:08:33] spirit in life will put the bride in her
[2:08:35] place because she'll recognize her
[2:08:37] position and the word then she's in
[2:08:39] Christ we'll put her in place no
[2:08:41] national force will do it but the
[2:08:43] national force did drive Israel into the
[2:08:45] homeland and the National forces of the
[2:08:48] Catholic Church Council of Churches will
[2:08:50] drive every organization into it but the
[2:08:53] power of God will raise the bride in the
[2:08:57] glory out of it what a problem study is
[2:09:00] and then of course Feast of the trumpets
[2:09:03] he told us that he said it was a spirit
[2:09:06] of Antichrist upon them bringing them to
[2:09:08] slaughter just like they didn't the
[2:09:10] other than our to call the bride how
[2:09:12] loose in the ecclesiastical church
[2:09:14] spirit Lucifer what not abundant along
[2:09:16] the nation's upon the bride now here you
[2:09:18] get it the bride will not go through
[2:09:21] that time the Bible says not the church
[2:09:24] will but not the bride can't you see
[2:09:27] ministers can't you see brethren that
[2:09:29] you say the church has got to go to the
[2:09:31] persecution for the perfection of it the
[2:09:34] blood of Jesus Christ perfects the bride
[2:09:36] a man who chooses his wife don't put her
[2:09:39] through a lot of punishment he's already
[2:09:41] found grace to with her she's found
[2:09:43] grace with him he engages to her and if
[2:09:45] anything he'll keep her from every place
[2:09:48] to turn her head his grace is so great
[2:09:53] amen but I will tell you that we have
[2:09:58] been in a time of trouble and this age
[2:10:02] is the last page and it's full of
[2:10:05] trouble and I award you it will only get
[2:10:09] worse you gonna wind up in the
[2:10:12] Tribulation Period and as we go closer

[2:20:11] waiver and see and you don't know what
[2:20:14] to believe and these quotes are towed
[2:20:16] and that misses food and that you're
[2:20:18] wondering this and you wonder that he's
[2:20:20] their sums they 111 he will give his
[2:20:29] angels charge concerning you to guard
[2:20:32] you in all your ways you're not alone
[2:20:38] he is there so what brother Jim what
[2:20:42] water water what if what if what what if
[2:20:44] what if what if what if what if what if
[2:20:46] and I hear the tremble what if I I get
[2:20:49] what if I die all death can do is take
[2:20:53] you into his presence so what if you die
[2:20:58] you escape just the same
[2:21:06] as listening brother branham and
[2:21:10] listening to the report of where he was
[2:21:13] in the jungles of our meetings he'd went
[2:21:16] to get system Mita who was joined him
[2:21:18] for the last day of those meetings where
[2:21:19] he's eight days and nights and the
[2:21:21] prayer lines he went to get system Mita
[2:21:24] I don't know maybe met her in a train
[2:21:27] station or bus station somewhere got her
[2:21:31] brought it there I had to park blocks
[2:21:33] away to get to the where the meetings
[2:21:35] was there's no parking as he was going
[2:21:41] in a little ambulance driver comes
[2:21:43] waving at him and and just you know
[2:21:46] trying frantically to get his attention
[2:21:48] he said you calling me sir yes I'm
[2:21:50] calling you said please come quick
[2:21:53] there's a woman here it is dying if she
[2:21:55] ain't dead he said I can't go there
[2:22:00] there's thousands of people and I can't
[2:22:03] show you no preference here and this
[2:22:05] time like this I can't but he said the
[2:22:07] man he's he's in desperate condition his
[2:22:10] wife is dead he's can't you just come
[2:22:12] and comfort him just a little prayer
[2:22:14] anything easy you know I can't stand to
[2:22:16] see this old man he's brought his wife
[2:22:19] she's had cancer in the female glands
[2:22:22] and and and it was all wrapped around
[2:22:24] they couldn't do surgery and now she's
[2:22:26] dying and they've sold everything they
[2:22:28] could to hire me to come in and the
[2:22:30] sandlots to come to the meeting and now
[2:22:32] she's dead and he said well just call an
[2:22:34] undertaker he said no said please come
[2:22:37] off or at least already comfort please
[2:22:40] sorry if it was brother branham said
[2:22:43] okay so they made a way and someone said
[2:22:45] we'll help you get there and but to us
[2:22:48] sure he got him through the crowd and
[2:22:50] got him down into there he said he got
[2:22:53] in there and said there was an old man
[2:22:54] with some patched up overalls he's and
[2:22:58] he was crying and so mamas dead mother's
[2:23:01] dead and he said no but but how could
[2:23:06] this be said we were believing with all
[2:23:09] our hearts and we trying to get here to
[2:23:11] the meet and then we just didn't make it
[2:23:12] in time and now
[2:23:13] that is how you did are you the doctor
[2:23:17] said no I'm brother branham he said well
[2:23:20] what would you pray for he said well
[2:23:21] yeah I'll offer a word of Prayer he's
[2:23:25] felt everything there was no pumps
[2:23:28] furthermore he took her by the her right
[2:23:32] hand by his left hand and there was no
[2:23:34] moving of those of those that cancer
[2:23:38] which would move on his arm as a sign of
[2:23:41] that of that life that would reflect
[2:23:44] against him now the reason I'm saying
[2:23:46] this even if death does take you the
[2:23:50] cancer dies it dies too but you still
[2:23:54] live you can't die so you're gonna win
[2:24:00] no matter what no matter which way you
[2:24:06] go you're gonna die in faith if that's
[2:24:08] the way you go through death you're
[2:24:09] gonna die in faith but the demon will
[2:24:12] die too but you will still be living one
[2:24:18] breath beyond here that's why you can
[2:24:22] stand with every cancer victim or
[2:24:24] anybody else with dazzle of a germ
[2:24:27] disease and and say look in the gasket
[2:24:30] this man still living but that demons
[2:24:33] dead the Bram said there was no life so
[2:24:41] he said I just begin to pray said Lord
[2:24:46] Jesus you understand this man has sold
[2:24:50] everything that he had sold his farm and
[2:24:55] different things to get her to surgery
[2:24:56] and that didn't work and sold his
[2:24:59] neither sold her blackberries and some
[2:25:01] quilts and in order to make the tip here
[2:25:04] and now she's going to use he's praying
[2:25:06] like that he felt his hand her hand
[2:25:09] squeeze his he opened his eyes for a
[2:25:12] moment and he looked and see him still
[2:25:14] seemed like she was still dead so he
[2:25:17] just said that was my imagination he
[2:25:19] just kept praying there and
[2:25:22] and a moment again she squeezed his hand
[2:25:25] again and and he opened his eyes and was
[2:25:31] looking at her and said you could see
[2:25:34] the muddy the muddy waters coming out of
[2:25:36] her eyes and all of a sudden her eyes
[2:25:38] flick open and become not clouded
[2:25:42] anymore but clear and she looks up at
[2:25:44] him and says who are you are you the
[2:25:49] doctor and he said no I'm brother
[2:25:51] Branham and as he began to talk with her
[2:25:54] the dad sitting over there with his head
[2:25:56] down crying here we gonna say mother
[2:25:59] mother mother you're live here you're
[2:26:01] living and he said he felt her hand and
[2:26:05] the cancer was dead there was no life in
[2:26:08] it he said she was healed by the glory
[2:26:11] of God and I just want to say to you you
[2:26:14] see that was because of an angelic visit
[2:26:18] and I want you the angel of this
[2:26:21] presence of complices that accompanies
[2:26:23] this message and there is a war that is
[2:26:27] going on and he has spit up on your
[2:26:29] behalf that even even in death he'll
[2:26:33] raise you up even in sickness he'll make
[2:26:36] you well a man that there's no disease
[2:26:39] known to man that this God doesn't have
[2:26:42] the remedy far and he will give his
[2:26:47] angels charge concerning the little
[2:26:50] bride to guard you in all your ways
[2:26:53] Exodus 23 20 and let's go back to their
[2:26:57] Exodus nominee believes we're in the
[2:26:58] Nexus and then listen I am sending an
[2:27:02] angel ahead of you to guard you along
[2:27:05] the way and to bring you to the place
[2:27:07] that I have prepared and I want you to
[2:27:10] remember I want to remind you shall I
[2:27:14] blow a trumpet to you man a gospel
[2:27:17] trumpet a memorial a reminder that there
[2:27:21] is an angel that accompanies this
[2:27:24] message and no message has been
[2:27:28] vindicated by an angel
[2:27:30] like this
[2:27:33] Jacob had blind faith all Roberts
[2:27:37] students audience just imagine Jesus
[2:27:40] standing there and that Jesus was right
[2:27:43] here but this messenger he didn't
[2:27:46] imagine anything he did not bind faith
[2:27:50] hey man he he had an actual visible
[2:27:55] presence of an angel and many saw that
[2:27:59] angel and pictures were taken out that
[2:28:02] angel and that light that surrounded his
[2:28:06] presence and those who didn't see it
[2:28:08] were like me I didn't see the angel nor
[2:28:13] did I see the light but I'd like when
[2:28:16] you see the wind and it glows the trees
[2:28:18] I saw the effects and man has it
[2:28:22] discerned the hearts as it called out
[2:28:24] sickness as it spoke to different
[2:28:26] individuals and me as a live 11 year old
[2:28:29] boy I saw the effects of that angel as
[2:28:32] he passed through the congregation
[2:28:35] hallelujah a man I didn't see an angel
[2:28:39] with sister lana was healed but he was
[2:28:41] here I didn't see an angel when he swept
[2:28:45] through the room hey man you can just
[2:28:47] say oh it just was happenstance at that
[2:28:50] moment sister Karen her brain a brain
[2:28:53] bleed dissipated in her brain and and
[2:28:55] the swelling went down and at that
[2:28:57] moment sight came back but explain to me
[2:29:00] how a little crippled boy who'd never
[2:29:01] walk couldn't pull up couldn't take a
[2:29:04] step are you with me
[2:29:05] a man jumps up mid doesn't take his
[2:29:08] first step walking doesn't take his
[2:29:10] first steps Dublin that baby got up out
[2:29:13] of that floor and ran around the room
[2:29:16] the house and my my eyes were watching
[2:29:19] followed him around watching in
[2:29:22] amazement the working of the Holy Spirit
[2:29:24] as a crippled boy walk and my wife could
[2:29:27] see I had maybe seen the angel but I've
[2:29:32] seen the effects a man and I see the
[2:29:36] effects of oh this is the very gospel
[2:29:39] that we have it changes life it very
[2:29:41] many turns men from sin and darkness
[2:29:44] into light it is the angel of his
[2:29:47] present and he said I'll never leave you
[2:29:49] and I'll never forsake you I'm gonna try
[2:29:59] to close illness because I've got enough
[2:30:05] till 6 o'clock tonight it could probably
[2:30:09] go longer but I haven't heard his voice
[2:30:15] since a child it was at the age of 37
[2:30:23] after being told over and over by the
[2:30:26] clergy and Vala ministers that God
[2:30:30] didn't heal no more remember the church
[2:30:33] brother Brandon was in was a Baptist
[2:30:35] Church they didn't believe in healing
[2:30:43] would you think of it like this when he
[2:30:46] went to mill town got an old Apple box
[2:30:50] now watch as I went to the steps of a
[2:30:53] prophet it was being led by the Lord
[2:30:55] didn't know what to do and I know it
[2:30:57] gives me a lot of comfort because
[2:30:58] there's a lot of times you don't know
[2:31:00] where you're gonna put your foot next
[2:31:02] he tried this and he tried that he went
[2:31:06] and bought in my apple cart Apple
[2:31:09] Creighton stepped up on it and said but
[2:31:12] no words would come to his mind and he
[2:31:14] was just stumbling around to try to say
[2:31:16] something thought he'd preach on the
[2:31:17] street and that wasn't working he wasn't
[2:31:20] anointing for that so brother Ike came
[2:31:25] by and said that that cause he'd went
[2:31:26] together with him so why don't you
[2:31:30] go with me why don't you just go with me
[2:31:33] down to - I'm gonna sell some eggs to a
[2:31:37] man and once you go with me there and
[2:31:38] you passes by Church and he feels in
[2:31:40] those a very strange spirit he goes
[2:31:42] there doors locked
[2:31:45] so you don't what to do now he sits
[2:31:48] there on the steps a man comes up said
[2:31:50] you one in here said I've got the key
[2:31:55] but because that they put on the flyer
[2:31:58] inviting people to a meeting it was an
[2:32:01] old abandoned church the city had taken
[2:32:03] over and they got permission that day to
[2:32:05] hold a meeting they put on the flyer
[2:32:08] brother right thought it was thought it
[2:32:11] would be good you know I'm put on there
[2:32:13] another little Billy Sunday thought that
[2:32:15] would attract but down at the bottom
[2:32:17] said bring the sick and afflicted we
[2:32:19] pray for the sick and because of that
[2:32:21] nobody would come to the meetings that
[2:32:25] night he would preach to three people
[2:32:29] three or four people brother right his
[2:32:32] son and daughter and maybe it's for the
[2:32:35] rights why big into building the next
[2:32:41] night the man steps to the door knocks
[2:32:48] his pipe out said I want to see that
[2:32:51] little Billy Sunday brother right said
[2:32:54] come in have a seat and runs up till the
[2:32:56] brother branham said that's the hardest
[2:32:57] man in the city
[2:32:58] he owns a rock quarry down here said
[2:33:01] he's hard they invited him to come down
[2:33:05] front to said he's and I'll sit here in
[2:33:07] the back I watched this part you watch
[2:33:09] yours really hard brother branham went
[2:33:14] and prayed started preaching preacher
[2:33:17] with all his heart that night at the end
[2:33:22] of that service that man bill Hall came
[2:33:27] down to the altar and gave his heart to
[2:33:29] Christ surrendered his heart now they
[2:33:36] got one person bill Hall goes back to
[2:33:39] the quarry and tells all his employee
[2:33:41] get down here to this meeting you got to
[2:33:43] hear this
[2:33:43] breech change my life he invites his
[2:33:47] neighbors the next night they got about
[2:33:49] 18 at the end of this meeting there that
[2:33:53] night they called for those who are sick
[2:33:55] and and they have prayer and people are
[2:33:57] healed people with cancer people other
[2:33:59] situations are healed noise goes out the
[2:34:02] next night to have you know many more
[2:34:05] and finally they got a building full and
[2:34:08] finally you know but but again you know
[2:34:10] in all of this you see it was the Holy
[2:34:13] Spirit movement and the angel of God
[2:34:15] leading and led him right down to meal
[2:34:18] town where a little girl was crying out
[2:34:21] trapped in the prison of her own body
[2:34:23] and brought deliverance to the little
[2:34:27] Georgie Carter ma'am and it was all
[2:34:30] because of the angel of his presence and
[2:34:33] it goes to show you no matter where you
[2:34:35] are and how the ecclesiastical spirits
[2:34:39] that say the days of miracles are past
[2:34:41] and they had banned anybody said anybody
[2:34:44] goes to that church meeting where that
[2:34:46] man praying for the sick we don't
[2:34:48] believe in that will excommunicate you
[2:34:50] from the church can't you see it was an
[2:34:52] ecclesiastical spirit bringing the
[2:34:55] persecution but the little lambs were
[2:34:59] getting it anyway and that's the thing
[2:35:04] with you the work it cannot be kept from
[2:35:07] God's elect that's gonna find you
[2:35:09] somewhere and it sounds you I want you
[2:35:16] just to stop for a moment because that
[2:35:18] wasn't Georgie's only healing and 1954
[2:35:21] she gets breast cancer and she's dying
[2:35:23] again and there's no hope but the angel
[2:35:31] of God comes to rescue again heals her
[2:35:34] of her breast cancer and she lives into
[2:35:37] the 1990s 1998 I think 84 years old ripe
[2:35:46] old age why because of this angel
[2:35:56] what am I trying to tell you I'm trying
[2:35:59] to tell you there's an angel gone to the
[2:36:02] land scientifically they've named it
[2:36:05] come in 19 it came from eating unclean
[2:36:10] animals people - just used some Bible
[2:36:15] guidelines you know of cleanliness and
[2:36:19] uncleanness maybe this wouldn't even
[2:36:21] crossed over into humans
[2:36:24] but these heathen people do this so it
[2:36:30] crosses crossed over from bats or snakes
[2:36:33] or something there and crossed over into
[2:36:35] humans and mutates and comes in and now
[2:36:38] is a spirit going through the world and
[2:36:41] people are shaking in their boots but at
[2:36:48] that time Michael stand up I want you to
[2:36:55] know you're not alone little bride
[2:36:58] wherever you are around the world we're
[2:37:01] not going through the tribulation and
[2:37:03] persecution is not what we need for a
[2:37:06] body change we have received the message
[2:37:08] for the body change you just want to
[2:37:11] talk about that final quick and when we
[2:37:13] see the data rise we're gonna be changed
[2:37:15] immediately to be like them we've
[2:37:18] already received the last sign I've been
[2:37:21] telling you you're on display and you're
[2:37:24] it
[2:37:25] because you are the last sign God in
[2:37:28] human flesh he manifested through a
[2:37:31] prophet now manifested in Brad form I
[2:37:33] want you to be a sign to the world Jesus
[2:37:36] Christ lives and he's the same yesterday
[2:37:38] today and forever
[2:37:39] don't doubt don't fear believe only
[2:37:43] believe all things are possible nothing
[2:37:47] can harm you not even death because if
[2:37:50] death would hit you the Spirit of God is
[2:37:52] gonna raise you up remember divine
[2:37:55] healing it is the earnest of the
[2:37:59] resurrection we got to have it and you
[2:38:02] got to get sick to be healed
[2:38:05] otherwise we wouldn't have divine
[2:38:07] healing we'd have divine health you know
[2:38:10] we don't we have mortal bodies but there
[2:38:13] is a healer and I want you to put your
[2:38:16] faith in him this morning as a musician
[2:38:18] comes and we try to wind this down maybe
[2:38:21] I can speak about this a little more in
[2:38:24] a further service on how to enforce it
[2:38:28] how to be on display but I want you to
[2:38:30] understand the Holy Spirit is here to
