[1:03:27] we thank you for that promise
[1:03:29] we ask these things in Jesus name amen
[1:03:34] amen turn to Joel chapter 2 and also
[1:03:37] John chapter 1.
[1:03:38] amen it's good to be with you this
[1:03:41] morning the house of the Lord
[1:03:43] amen God's good to us
[1:03:45] just wanted to thank the Lord for all
[1:03:47] the mothers that are among us and I know
[1:03:49] this is a day set aside to honor mothers
[1:03:53] but I I believe it is the prophet of God
[1:03:54] saying said every day ought to honor
[1:03:57] mother amen and so uh but we do want to
[1:04:01] give you the honor that you are due and
[1:04:03] the time that we're living in when the
[1:04:04] world is stripped all that away and and
[1:04:07] you know put put a woman out in the
[1:04:10] workforce and to do those things and
[1:04:11] took her away from the home to do what
[1:04:13] God had called her to do I'm thankful
[1:04:15] that there's still real true God called
[1:04:17] mothers amen and if you have a mother
[1:04:20] you ought to be thankful for her today
[1:04:22] amen God bless you let's look here Joel
[1:04:25] chapter 2 and verse 25. I will restore
[1:04:29] to you the years that the Locust has
[1:04:31] eaten and canker worm the caterpillar
[1:04:34] the Palmer worm my great Army which I
[1:04:37] sent among you and ye shall eat in
[1:04:39] plenty and be satisfied and praise the
[1:04:41] name of the Lord your God that has dealt
[1:04:44] wondrously with you and my people shall
[1:04:48] never be ashamed and you shall know that
[1:04:50] I'm in the midst of Israel and that I am
[1:04:53] the Lord your God and none else and my
[1:04:56] people shall never be ashamed it's
[1:04:58] amazing he said that twice amen it's a
[1:05:01] double promise and it shall come to pass
[1:05:02] afterward that I will pour out my spirit
[1:05:05] upon All Flesh and your sons and your
[1:05:09] daughters shall prophesy your old men
[1:05:11] shall dream dreams and your young men
[1:05:14] shall see visions and also upon the
[1:05:17] servants and upon the handmaids in those
[1:05:19] days will I pour out my spirit
[1:05:23] John chapter 1 and verse 1 says in the
[1:05:25] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:05:28] with God and the Word was God the same
[1:05:30] was in the beginning with God all things
[1:05:33] were made by him and without him was not
[1:05:35] anything made that was made in him was
[1:05:38] life and the life was the light of men
[1:05:43] and the light shineth and darkness and
[1:05:46] the Darkness comprehendeth it not there
[1:05:49] was a man sent from God whose name was
[1:05:51] John the same came for witness to Bear
[1:05:54] witness of that light that all men
[1:05:56] through him might believe but he was not
[1:05:58] that light but was sent to Bear witness
[1:06:01] of that light that was the True Light
[1:06:04] which lighteth every man that cometh
[1:06:06] into the world he was in the world and
[1:06:09] the world was made by him and the world
[1:06:11] knew him not he came unto his own and
[1:06:14] his own received him not but as many as
[1:06:17] received him to him gave he power to
[1:06:20] become the sons of God even to them that
[1:06:23] believe on his name which were born not
[1:06:26] of the blood nor the will of the flesh
[1:06:28] nor the will of man but of God and the
[1:06:31] Word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:06:33] and we beheld his glory the glory is of
[1:06:37] the only begotten of the father full of
[1:06:39] grace and truth amen God bless you can
[1:06:42] be seated
[1:06:54] I'd like to speak to you this morning on
[1:06:57] the light the season of the bringer
[1:07:00] amen I believe that's the season that
[1:07:02] we're in he's bringing life he's brought
[1:07:05] life again into the body we know that we
[1:07:08] were all born in sin and shaped in
[1:07:12] iniquity we were all born with a sin
[1:07:14] nature
[1:07:15] Ephesians 2 and verse 1 says we were
[1:07:17] dead in trespasses of sin
[1:07:21] so you know we may have heard salvation
[1:07:23] many times described as something like
[1:07:25] this you know I was drowning in a sea of
[1:07:28] sin and Jesus came by in a boat and he
[1:07:31] threw out a lifeline and he pulled me on
[1:07:33] board and he saved me amen that's all
[1:07:35] that's all wonderful and it's good but
[1:07:38] it's truly the gospel says you were dead
[1:07:40] in sins and trespasses in other words
[1:07:44] you were weren't just drowning in the
[1:07:47] sea of your sin you were dead floating
[1:07:50] face down and Jesus walked on the water
[1:07:53] and it came to where you could when you
[1:07:55] could not come to him and he picked you
[1:07:58] up and he carried your dead body back to
[1:08:01] the shore and breathed eternal life into
[1:08:03] your lungs
[1:08:05] amen God what a mighty God we serve then
[1:08:09] he says here in John 1 and verse 4 in
[1:08:12] him was the life and that life was the
[1:08:15] light of men so Jesus came into the
[1:08:18] world to bring light and to bring life
[1:08:20] because he came into the world into a
[1:08:23] world that was spiritually blind it was
[1:08:25] spiritually dark and it was spiritually
[1:08:27] dead and there was no life that was
[1:08:30] there any longer in any kind of
[1:08:31] religious Realms or any kind they hadn't
[1:08:34] had a prophet in some 400 years that had
[1:08:36] even spoke the word of God to them and
[1:08:39] so they ca he came in a time that was
[1:08:40] very blind and a very dark and very dead
[1:08:43] but when Jesus came we read that he was
[1:08:46] not he was not recognized or received by
[1:08:49] the world Amen because in John 3 and
[1:08:51] verse 19 it says people love Darkness
[1:08:54] rather than light because their deeds
[1:08:57] were evil amen and so we see again a
[1:08:59] parallel of the time that we're living
[1:09:01] in it's again a very dead world is a
[1:09:04] very spirit actually blind World in a
[1:09:06] very spiritually dark world Amen we see
[1:09:09] that people's Deeds are very evil and
[1:09:12] they love Darkness more than they loved
[1:09:14] light amen and sowed but Jesus is the
[1:09:18] true light and there is love there there
[1:09:20] is light in no other one there's night
[1:09:23] light there is not light in any other
[1:09:25] thing now there are fake lights in the
[1:09:27] world but Jesus is not merely a light he
[1:09:31] is the light
[1:09:32] amen he's not just merely speaking of a
[1:09:35] light he is the Fulfillment of what
[1:09:38] light really is he is the truth and so
[1:09:41] and but you know also in that scripture
[1:09:43] Not only was there a rejecting of light
[1:09:46] but there was also a receiving of life
[1:09:48] and he said but all who did receive him
[1:09:51] to him gave them power or the right to
[1:09:54] be children of God to those that believe
[1:09:56] in his name see light will change you if
[1:10:00] you receive it amen he was you know I
[1:10:02] know no doubt uh light you know here was
[1:10:05] Saul we could look at Saul and we could
[1:10:07] see how he was changed by light he was
[1:10:10] changed from a murderer to a missionary
[1:10:12] from a church hater to a church planter
[1:10:15] he had no idea all that God had stored
[1:10:18] from him when he was on that horse on
[1:10:20] the way to Damascus but a light struck
[1:10:22] him down and when that light begins to
[1:10:25] get in you it begins to change you amen
[1:10:28] it begins to turn you around this light
[1:10:30] knows how to stop you in your trash sex
[1:10:33] it knows how to turn you around nothing
[1:10:35] could have stopped Saul but the light of
[1:10:38] God and so God knows what it takes to
[1:10:41] bring us to our knees to stop fighting
[1:10:43] him to stop pulling away from him he
[1:10:46] knows amen because you cannot fight that
[1:10:48] light that light will overtake you amen
[1:10:51] his light will bring forth life amen he
[1:10:55] is this he is the life bringer as we as
[1:10:57] we read in the scripture amen of of all
[1:11:01] those the the worms that had come and
[1:11:03] destroyed the plant and it would have
[1:11:05] destroyed the life but he said I'm going
[1:11:08] to restore I'm going to bring a
[1:11:10] restoration of what all these have done
[1:11:13] and and I'm going to bring and we read
[1:11:15] this Wednesday night and in this this
[1:11:17] quote but I just want to bring it up
[1:11:18] again he said and it shall bring forth
[1:11:21] fruit in his season he says watch it's
[1:11:23] his fruit God's fruit and then the
[1:11:26] prophet is bringing it'll be in the
[1:11:27] prophet season God's fruit God's Time by
[1:11:31] The Prophet's season he shall bring
[1:11:32] forth there's fruit in this season see
[1:11:34] there's two his there bring forth God's
[1:11:37] fruit in the season that the messenger
[1:11:40] is ordained to come he will bring those
[1:11:42] things forth the messenger that brings
[1:11:44] the fruit of God will bring it in God's
[1:11:47] season in the season of the bringer and
[1:11:51] so I got to thinking about the bringer
[1:11:52] and how many times and there's there's
[1:11:54] all kinds of times of work amen God
[1:11:57] spoke of himself as a bringer and we can
[1:11:59] read about it in Exodus chapter 3 and
[1:12:02] verse 17 he says and I have said I will
[1:12:05] bring you up out of the Affliction of
[1:12:08] the Egyptians unto the land of the
[1:12:10] Canaanites and the Hittites and the
[1:12:12] amorites and on down it says in Exodus
[1:12:14] chapter 6 and verse 6 it says wherefore
[1:12:17] say unto the children of Israel I am the
[1:12:20] Lord and I will bring you out from under
[1:12:23] the burdens of the Egyptians and I will
[1:12:26] rid you of their bondage and I will
[1:12:28] redeem you with a stressed out arm and
[1:12:31] with great judgments and we can say that
[1:12:33] he did that amen we can say that he
[1:12:35] brought them out of slavery and set them
[1:12:38] free amen they had to go through a lot
[1:12:40] of things in their life but what he
[1:12:42] promised he brought to pass amen it said
[1:12:45] it said a precedence or it said
[1:12:48] something there that we can look at a
[1:12:50] law of God that what God done he does
[1:12:53] What God Says amen and what he said he
[1:12:56] brought to pass and so we can look at
[1:12:58] the same God that moved upon them is the
[1:13:01] same God that's going to move for us
[1:13:03] amen and I love how he said that he said
[1:13:06] that twice as I I mentioned that and my
[1:13:08] people shall never be ashamed because he
[1:13:10] has a natural seed and a spiritual seed
[1:13:13] so he wants you to know that they shall
[1:13:15] never be ashamed the natural seed but
[1:13:18] also the spiritual sea shall never be
[1:13:21] ashamed amen that God will bring forth
[1:13:24] what he said he was going to bring forth
[1:13:25] in the season of the bringer now it may
[1:13:28] not be in our season or in our time or
[1:13:31] when we want it to be but when his God
[1:13:33] has ordained for that to happen there
[1:13:36] ain't nothing that can stop it it's
[1:13:38] going to come to pass I don't care what
[1:13:40] you're asking for if it's in the word of
[1:13:42] God it's going to come to pass and God's
[1:13:45] going to bring it amen in Isaiah 42 and
[1:13:48] verse 16 it says I will bring the Blind
[1:13:52] by the way that they knew not and I will
[1:13:54] lead them
[1:13:56] excuse me in past that they have not
[1:13:59] known and I will make Darkness light
[1:14:01] before them and crooked things straight
[1:14:04] these things will I do unto them and not
[1:14:07] forsake them
[1:14:09] Hallelujah God is Not forsaken his
[1:14:12] people this morning that's enough right
[1:14:14] there to shout about it doesn't you may
[1:14:17] look like it's forsaken it may look like
[1:14:19] you're forgotten but there's a word that
[1:14:21] says here I'm going to bring it to pass
[1:14:23] I'm going to bring the blind amen by the
[1:14:26] way that they do not I'm going to lead
[1:14:28] them and pass it they have not known and
[1:14:31] I'm going to make Darkness light before
[1:14:33] them and I'm going to straighten all the
[1:14:35] crooked things out in their life and I'm
[1:14:37] going to bring them back to me
[1:14:39] Hallelujah that's something to shout
[1:14:41] about to realize your children may be
[1:14:43] out there blind right now but the
[1:14:45] bringer is going to bring them forth and
[1:14:48] he's going to bring the Blind by way
[1:14:49] they've not known before they didn't
[1:14:52] know it was possible they didn't know
[1:14:53] they could do it they didn't know it was
[1:14:55] able they didn't know it would be about
[1:14:57] that they could be a Son of God or a
[1:14:59] daughter of God or they could be a child
[1:15:01] of God but I'm going to make the
[1:15:03] darkness light before them and I'm going
[1:15:05] to straighten out all those
[1:15:06] misunderstandings
[1:15:09] and I'm going to straighten out all the
[1:15:11] Crooked ways and I'm going to make them
[1:15:13] straight because I want you to know I'm
[1:15:15] not going to forsake them but I'm going
[1:15:17] to bring them forth
[1:15:20] Hallelujah Isaiah 43 and verse 1 says it
[1:15:23] like this but now thus saith the Lord
[1:15:26] that created thee o Jacob he has formed
[1:15:28] the O Israel fear not for I have
[1:15:31] redeemed Thee I have called thee by my
[1:15:33] name and thou art mine
[1:15:37] amen that's what we need to let the
[1:15:39] devil know I am his I belong to Jesus so
[1:15:44] when I pass through the waters I he'll
[1:15:46] be with me when I go through the rivers
[1:15:49] they'll not overflow me but when I walk
[1:15:51] us through the fire Thou shalt not be
[1:15:54] burned neither shall the flame Kindle
[1:15:56] upon thee for I am the Lord thy God the
[1:16:00] Holy One of Israel amen thy savior I
[1:16:03] gave Egypt for thy Ransom Ethiopians see
[1:16:06] before thee since thou was precious in
[1:16:09] my sight thou has been honorable and I
[1:16:12] have loved thee therefore I will give
[1:16:14] men for thee and people for thy life
[1:16:16] fear not for I am with thee and I will
[1:16:20] bring thy seed from the East and gather
[1:16:23] thee from the west and I'll say to the
[1:16:25] north give them up
[1:16:28] Hallelujah and to the South keep not
[1:16:30] back and bring my sons from far and my
[1:16:34] daughters from the ends of the Earth
[1:16:37] so it's showing it's right there in the
[1:16:39] promises of God they can never get far
[1:16:42] enough they can never get deep enough
[1:16:44] it'll never get dark enough but it's
[1:16:47] love and his Mercy shall follow them
[1:16:50] to the ends of the Earth even everyone
[1:16:53] that is called by my name for I have
[1:16:56] created him for my glory and I have
[1:16:58] formed him yea I have made him bring
[1:17:01] forth the blind people that have eyes
[1:17:05] well that's a paradox
[1:17:08] amen the blind people that have eyes and
[1:17:11] the death that have ears
[1:17:14] amen they didn't know they had eyes
[1:17:17] but there was another eyesight that was
[1:17:19] coming
[1:17:20] they didn't know we had ears but there
[1:17:22] was another ear a hearing that was
[1:17:24] coming let all the nations be gathered
[1:17:26] together and let the people be assembled
[1:17:28] who among them can declare this and show
[1:17:31] us former things let them bring forth
[1:17:33] their witnesses that they may be
[1:17:35] justified or let them hear and say it is
[1:17:38] the truth you are my witness saith the
[1:17:41] Lord and my servant whom I've chosen
[1:17:43] that you may know and believe me and
[1:17:45] understand that I am me before me there
[1:17:47] is no God form neither shall be after me
[1:17:50] I even I am the Lord and beside me there
[1:17:53] is no savior I have declared I have
[1:17:56] saved and have shown when there was no
[1:17:59] strange God among you therefore ye are
[1:18:01] my Witnesses saith the Lord I am God yea
[1:18:04] before the day was I am he and there is
[1:18:08] none that can deliver out of my hand I
[1:18:11] will work and who shall let it
[1:18:14] what does that mean who can revoke what
[1:18:17] I have said who can reverse what I do
[1:18:22] so it doesn't matter what the devil has
[1:18:24] said about him or the devil has said
[1:18:26] about you it matters what God Said first
[1:18:29] because remember there was another voice
[1:18:31] that is spoke over your life before the
[1:18:34] devil ever did there was another law
[1:18:36] that was put in place before the devil
[1:18:39] ever had one moment of right over your
[1:18:41] life or one moment to be able to touch
[1:18:43] you there was already a law that was
[1:18:46] theirs hanging over you a prophecy it
[1:18:49] says devil you can only go so far you
[1:18:51] can only do so much but I'm going to
[1:18:54] bring them back the saith the Lord and
[1:18:57] you can hold them but I'm going to say
[1:18:58] turn them loose and you can hinder them
[1:19:00] but I'm gonna say let them go
[1:19:02] [Applause]
[1:19:05] Hallelujah the bringer will bring them
[1:19:08] forth
[1:19:11] because he is the bringer
[1:19:13] when he brings it it is finished
[1:19:18] he is the bringer of light

[1:23:34] Us

[1:23:37] he's handing them out to those that will
[1:23:39] believe
[1:23:41] amen this morning he's loaded down with
[1:23:43] Promises of God and he's just looking to
[1:23:46] bring somebody some Joy this morning and
[1:23:48] somebody some happiness this morning and
[1:23:51] somebody I promised this morning if

[1:23:54] with me no is there anything too hard
[1:23:56] for God whatever you have need of he has
[1:23:59] it
[1:24:06] there was some seeds in the upper room
[1:24:10] and the light shined upon the seeds and
[1:24:12] it bloomed out on the day of Pentecost
[1:24:14] on the damn penny cost a few a days 50
[1:24:18] days after Easter there came a rushing
[1:24:20] Mighty Wind Out of Heaven
[1:24:22] amen you know he said we want to make
[1:24:24] that difference say well the minister
[1:24:26] stands up with his collar all fixed up
[1:24:28] and says I'll put your name on the book
[1:24:30] or you come up here and you eat a
[1:24:32] certain kind of bread and you'll become
[1:24:34] a member of the church he said the
[1:24:35] minister say come join our growth he
[1:24:38] said they're wrong
[1:24:40] he said Pentecost Came From Heaven
[1:24:45] it came from Heaven not off the pulpit
[1:24:48] up the road from Heaven a priest no a
[1:24:51] minister no what was it a sound like a
[1:24:54] rushing Mighty Wind it filled the house
[1:24:56] where they were sitting and cloven
[1:24:58] tongue set upon each one of them and
[1:25:00] they began to speak in tongues they
[1:25:02] couldn't talk right they were so full of
[1:25:04] the glory of God the Holy Ghost filled
[1:25:07] each and every one of them
[1:25:10] and out on the streets they went even
[1:25:12] the dignified congregation stood out
[1:25:14] there and said why these men are full of
[1:25:16] new wine they're all drunk look at their
[1:25:18] men and women how they're staggering and
[1:25:20] carrying on he said that's how the
[1:25:23] church was ordained
[1:25:28] come on now
[1:25:30] that's how the church was ordained
[1:25:32] that's how the bringer brought it
[1:25:38] amen that's how the bringer brought life
[1:25:41] into the body
[1:25:44] he set the church in order right there
[1:25:48] the bringer did it and he taught the
[1:25:50] proper use of the gifts of the Spirit
[1:25:52] and he confirmed that they were to
[1:25:54] remain in the church till Jesus came
[1:25:59] amen is a direct quote amen listen I can
[1:26:03] understand if a man brings something he
[1:26:06] might take it back
[1:26:10] or if a man brings something he's only
[1:26:12] limited and so much how he can bring her
[1:26:14] so much what he can do that's not God
[1:26:17] God's unlimited amen listen to this he
[1:26:20] said you have a right to enjoy the full
[1:26:23] blessings of all the apostles had all
[1:26:26] that was in the early church will remain
[1:26:28] in the church because all that was in
[1:26:30] the church was Jesus Christ
[1:26:33] the life the light
[1:26:35] the bringer
[1:26:40] so those that want to know why we
[1:26:43] enjoying ourselves well it's my
[1:26:44] inalienable right
[1:26:52] unless you know it says until Jesus
[1:26:55] comes
[1:26:58] it's my right to be happy in the Lord
[1:27:03] why do you have this right because the
[1:27:04] bringer brought it
[1:27:06] not man not man's Creeds not man's ideas
[1:27:10] the bringer brought it to me
[1:27:13] the bringer handed it to me so it's my
[1:27:16] right as a child of God to enjoy the
[1:27:19] blessings in the church
[1:27:26] the Holy Ghost baptism was to last until
[1:27:30] Jesus returns again
[1:27:33] direct quotes
[1:27:34] amen so they want to change it today
[1:27:36] that's an easy beliefism and you believe
[1:27:39] the message and you're saved no either
[1:27:41] bringer brought it in the first place
[1:27:43] and he showed how it had to be had how
[1:27:46] it had to happen in the first place and
[1:27:48] so therefore if he brought it it still
[1:27:51] must remain
[1:27:59] another one that says we know that in
[1:28:02] the day of salvation
[1:28:03] where God is calling men from the world
[1:28:06] from a life of sin into a life of
[1:28:08] service and in the day that God is
[1:28:10] poured out his Spirit from on high great
[1:28:13] signs and wonders are accompanying the
[1:28:15] ministry of this day when the former and
[1:28:18] latter rain are Fallen together we know
[1:28:21] that they're supposed to be great signs
[1:28:23] and wonders which in many denominations
[1:28:26] this is turned down
[1:28:32] just turned they're being turned down in
[1:28:33] message denominations
[1:28:35] well days of Miracles are passed
[1:28:38] it's not the season of the day of
[1:28:40] Miracles listen if it's not the season
[1:28:42] of Miracles it's not the season of God
[1:28:47] amen I can understand if God's not in
[1:28:50] your church then you ain't got no
[1:28:51] miracles
[1:28:52] but if he's there there's Miracles
[1:28:54] there's signs there's wonders there's
[1:28:57] God moving among his people amen just
[1:29:00] talking to brother Tommy Richmond he's
[1:29:02] been witnessing to a friend of his uh uh
[1:29:04] when we grew up together I don't
[1:29:06] remember a whole story but he went into
[1:29:08] a seminary by the time he said it came
[1:29:11] out in a cemetery
[1:29:13] he said he went in more it went in dead
[1:29:16] but it came out twice dead
[1:29:18] he's a part of the Church of Christ and
[1:29:20] they have totally worked out all of the
[1:29:23] Miracles out of the church
[1:29:25] they totally stripped them all out and
[1:29:27] they say it only happened back in the
[1:29:29] days of the Apostles
[1:29:33] Hallelujah it must be still the days of
[1:29:36] the Apostles because they're still
[1:29:37] happening
[1:29:38] amen but you can give them sign after
[1:29:40] sign testimony after testimony and
[1:29:43] they'll you can put them you can put a
[1:29:45] picture for for them you can put sister
[1:29:46] Orlando's before and after and they'll
[1:29:49] say it ain't so
[1:29:51] just like they did in the days of Jesus
[1:29:53] when he looked at him and said well if
[1:29:55] you'll do this then we'll believe if
[1:29:57] you'll do this if they he'd have done
[1:29:58] everything that they said they still
[1:30:00] wouldn't have believed
[1:30:02] amen but God has a people who will
[1:30:05] believe
[1:30:06] it doesn't matter if you got proof or
[1:30:08] not you still believe
[1:30:12] it doesn't matter if I got proof yet
[1:30:14] that my child's coming home I'm still
[1:30:17] going to believe that
[1:30:19] I got proof If I'm Healed I still
[1:30:21] believe
[1:30:22] [Applause]
[1:30:25] the proof I'm speaking about is things
[1:30:27] you can see with these eyes we do have
[1:30:29] proof
[1:30:35] he said well you know that Blessed
[1:30:38] Virgin Mary she got it without sensation
[1:30:40] well
[1:30:42] God wouldn't let Mary come to heaven
[1:30:45] without receiving the Holy Ghost how are
[1:30:48] you going to get there anything short of
[1:30:50] it that's right Mary was among them she
[1:30:54] had to wait up there until she lost all
[1:30:57] her dignity and pride to be filled with
[1:31:00] the spirit
[1:31:02] and here they come acting like drunk
[1:31:04] people and the Bible said they did they
[1:31:06] said these men are full of new wine
[1:31:10] and Peter hey Peter spoke up and said
[1:31:12] they're not full of new wine as you
[1:31:13] suppose seeing this is the third hour of
[1:31:15] the day but this is that which is spoken
[1:31:18] of the Prophet Joel and it shall come to
[1:31:20] pass in the last day saith God I will
[1:31:23] pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and
[1:31:26] your sons and your daughters shall
[1:31:27] prophesy
[1:31:30] come on now he brought it into the first
[1:31:32] church
[1:31:34] the bringer brought it the bringer laid
[1:31:36] it there
[1:31:42] and I'll show wonders in the heavens and
[1:31:45] the Earth signs and it shall come to
[1:31:48] pass the whosoever shall call upon the
[1:31:50] name of the Lord shall be saved
[1:31:56] Peter preached Pentecost he planted a
[1:31:59] tree
[1:32:00] oh he planted it
[1:32:02] they went out had spiritual gifts they
[1:32:05] healed the sick they preached
[1:32:07] they preached
[1:32:10] they were thrown in jail they were
[1:32:12] willing to suffer for the word sake
[1:32:16] they had backbones about them
[1:32:22] amen they would stand in the face of
[1:32:24] doubts and unbelief and demons of hell
[1:32:26] and called the word of God the truth
[1:32:30] they would stand in the face of cripples
[1:32:32] and and proclaim the glory of God and
[1:32:35] God would bring it to pass that's what
[1:32:37] the bringer brought to the church
[1:32:43] listen
[1:32:45] brother said you know you wouldn't be a
[1:32:47] very good American
[1:32:49] if you'd slip on this is you know around
[1:32:50] look after the war had happened he said
[1:32:52] but you'd slip over to Japan
[1:32:55] and you'd slip it around the line saying
[1:32:57] listen fellas I'm with you I'm going to
[1:32:59] fight for your side he said you traitor
[1:33:02] yeah
[1:33:03] you ought to be shot
[1:33:05] you're a traitor
[1:33:07] he said that's the same way it is a man
[1:33:10] that knows the word of God and will
[1:33:12] compromise on it because some
[1:33:14] organization tells him he has to do it
[1:33:17] that way that's a traitor
[1:33:23] that's a traitor amen these men wasn't
[1:33:25] traitors they didn't care how much he
[1:33:28] said they well he said look they didn't
[1:33:30] care how much what somebody thought or
[1:33:32] How They carried on how their Church
[1:33:34] manners was screaming and crying and
[1:33:36] shouting and jabbering with language
[1:33:37] that seemed like impossible to
[1:33:40] understand
[1:33:42] they wasn't traitors
[1:33:46] I'm reading you a direct quote they
[1:33:48] wasn't traitors
[1:33:54] the first church screaming crying
[1:33:57] shouting jabbering off in languages
[1:34:02] they wouldn't traitors
[1:34:05] so I just say it like this what side do
[1:34:07] you find yourself on
[1:34:09] because the bringer brought it
[1:34:14] amen talking to one another could unders
[1:34:16] couldn't understand it these men out
[1:34:18] there in the audience of other nations
[1:34:19] their tongues begin to hear what they
[1:34:21] were saying they didn't know what they
[1:34:22] were saying they were jabbering other
[1:34:24] people were out there understood it and
[1:34:26] these people they said well these people
[1:34:27] are certainly drunk
[1:34:29] that's pretty awesome for a man to be
[1:34:31] drunk on natural wine a bit of just
[1:34:34] automatically speak another language
[1:34:38] do you realize how unbelief is
[1:34:41] how dumb unbelief is
[1:34:43] takes even the natural reasonings out
[1:34:45] that you mean to tell me that they could
[1:34:48] drink some no some wine out of a wine
[1:34:50] skin and start talking in languages of a
[1:34:53] different language and people could
[1:34:54] understand every word that's coming out
[1:34:55] of their mouth
[1:34:57] Ah that's unbelievable
[1:35:03] he said notice
[1:35:05] God planted a tree to bring forth nine
[1:35:09] spiritual gifts of his Spirit The Same
[1:35:12] Spirit was in Christ was to come down to
[1:35:15] the church
[1:35:17] the gifts of spirit was in the church
[1:35:19] and was growing and it was buried forth
[1:35:21] fruit they thought not of their self
[1:35:23] they didn't organize they just went
[1:35:24] ahead and they preached the word of God
[1:35:30] and Jesus seeing them before he ascended
[1:35:32] he said go into all the world and preach
[1:35:35] the gospel to Every Creature these signs
[1:35:37] shall follow them that believe in my
[1:35:39] name you shall cast out devils
[1:35:43] and they want to take that and say
[1:35:44] that's for another day
[1:35:46] this was his commission to the church to
[1:35:49] the tree
[1:35:50] to us
[1:35:51] if you're part of the tree if you're not
[1:35:53] part of the tree then understand why you
[1:35:55] don't believe it
[1:35:57] I understand why you don't preach it I
[1:36:00] understand why you put it way off there
[1:36:01] because you are not part of that same
[1:36:03] life but of that same life the bringer
[1:36:06] brought in the beginning it's now worked
[1:36:08] down into our age and our time and it's
[1:36:10] filling people again with the same power
[1:36:12] with the same anointing with the same
[1:36:15] God it has the same works
[1:36:21] because the bringer brought it
[1:36:24] we're talking about a church spiritual
[1:36:27] we're talking about a spiritual tree
[1:36:29] Jesus said these signs shall follow them
[1:36:32] that hangs on this tree
[1:36:35] oh that's where I'm hanging at today
[1:36:40] that's where I got my life tied to
[1:36:42] amen and said they shall speak with new
[1:36:45] tongues they shall take up serpent drink
[1:36:47] deadly things and it'll not harm them if
[1:36:49] they lay hands upon the sick they shall
[1:36:51] recover the tree was planted it was
[1:36:54] doing great work it was moving along
[1:36:56] baptizing went to church
[1:36:59] great fellowships they had nobody
[1:37:02] needing everything everybody was kind
[1:37:03] good-hearted one big family
[1:37:06] and all of a sudden
[1:37:08] it came this big old ugly looking greedy
[1:37:10] teeth beetle
[1:37:13] I like how he put that it's all ugly
[1:37:16] looking greedy teeth beetle
[1:37:19] devil you all ugly looking greedy teeth
[1:37:23] beetle
[1:37:29] I know some of you some of your sisters
[1:37:31] he wants to put a complex on you and say
[1:37:33] you're not very pretty
[1:37:35] well at least you ain't no ugly looking
[1:37:38] greedy teeth beetle
[1:37:45] now why don't you tell that Dad won't
[1:37:47] you go look in the mirror
[1:37:50] why don't you go look what you look like
[1:37:54] amen and listen we're not looking in
[1:37:57] mirrors made of man we're looking at
[1:37:59] mirrors made of God
[1:38:01] and when I look in this mirror he says
[1:38:03] I'm fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:38:08] amen so it doesn't matter what a mirror
[1:38:10] hanging on the wall says it matters what
[1:38:12] he said and what he said you devil you
[1:38:16] ain't nothing but a scroungy looking
[1:38:17] greedy tooth beetle
[1:38:23] Hallelujah it comes in four stages four
[1:38:26] insect destroyers they come into that
[1:38:29] beautiful tree of God and it began to
[1:38:32] pull it down
[1:38:36] Palmer worm begin to eat and destroy the
[1:38:39] fruit
[1:38:42] destroy the fruit that was among them
[1:38:46] to where
[1:38:48] it was a Jew that I had to we need to
[1:38:50] earnestly contend
[1:38:53] for the faith that was once delivered he
[1:38:55] saw it slipping away
[1:38:58] he saw things coming into the church
[1:39:00] that didn't belong and he started
[1:39:02] screaming out and he started pulling and
[1:39:04] started preaching the word of God what
[1:39:06] was it it was still still in the fruit
[1:39:08] and it was pulling them away from the
[1:39:10] Supernatural and was pulling them into
[1:39:12] Creeds and into dogmas into and the
[1:39:15] messages of the church
[1:39:18] and all the things the devil could get
[1:39:20] their eyes on instead of what God called
[1:39:22] them to be
[1:39:25] and let me tell you the only reason it
[1:39:27] happened because there was a time of
[1:39:28] planning
[1:39:32] otherwise that church would have went in
[1:39:34] a rapture
[1:39:35] amen there was people that were ready
[1:39:37] for Rapture Paul was writing about it
[1:39:40] they were ready to go he didn't realize
[1:39:42] there's seven more six more ages coming
[1:39:44] amen what was it God said wait a minute
[1:39:46] I got more names on the book
[1:39:50] I got more people laying out that old
[1:39:52] dirty dirt that the devil thinks he
[1:39:54] ain't gonna better he's going to hold
[1:39:56] him and I ain't gonna be able to get him
[1:39:57] but I'm gonna prove my word I'm going to
[1:40:00] prove I'm thus I'm just saying yesterday
[1:40:03] today and forever and I'm going to allow
[1:40:05] my beautiful tree to die and rot and go
[1:40:08] into the ground but it's going to come
[1:40:10] back again
[1:40:11] [Applause]
[1:40:13] and I'm gonna bring it back to the same
[1:40:15] power to the same love and mercy and
[1:40:18] Grace
[1:40:22] I'm the bringer
[1:40:28] he said we'll get he said pretty soon
[1:40:30] they got dignitaries in the church
[1:40:32] Mayors and so forth a better class
[1:40:36] and long
[1:40:37] you know when I begin to tell as long as
[1:40:39] y'all keep carrying on like that they'll
[1:40:41] never come around they'll afraid
[1:40:45] he said they're afraid of you carrying
[1:40:48] on like that
[1:40:50] somebody said somebody said that he said
[1:40:53] the other day and somebody said they
[1:40:54] still are
[1:40:56] he said I guess that's about right
[1:40:57] they're afraid of the Holy Spirit
[1:41:03] said I used to sing a little song you
[1:41:05] ever hear the old-time religion anybody
[1:41:07] I've heard that song Anybody it said you
[1:41:10] said it's the old-time Holy Spirit and
[1:41:13] the devil won't go well that's why I
[1:41:15] want it
[1:41:18] hey man it's the old time Holy Spirit
[1:41:21] and the devil won't go near that's the
[1:41:23] reason people fear it but it's good
[1:41:25] enough for me
[1:41:29] so good I want no other where it makes
[1:41:31] me love my brother it brings things from
[1:41:34] undercover oh

[1:41:44] of your life and say hey that's not you

[1:42:10] start the devil fly it's good enough for
[1:42:13] me I love that old song Amen it'll start
[1:42:17] the devil fly that's why we got to let
[1:42:19] the Holy Ghost loosen our services we're
[1:42:22] going to allow him to do his perfect
[1:42:23] work because we don't want the devil
[1:42:25] comfortable in these pews
[1:42:28] amen we want him to be uncomfortable and
[1:42:31] say hey hey hey I need out of here
[1:42:37] turn the Holy Ghost loose and let him do
[1:42:39] his perfect work let him set the captive
[1:42:42] free let him fill with the Holy Ghost
[1:42:44] let him heal and deliver let him do what
[1:42:47] he wants to do he is the bringer
[1:42:55] that's the reason people don't want any
[1:42:58] they didn't want Jesus
[1:43:01] they don't want his spirit
[1:43:04] the church so dignified
[1:43:07] he said you come and tell us who we are
[1:43:09] we'll give you to understand where Dr
[1:43:12] PhD
[1:43:15] LL q u s
[1:43:19] all of this I'm a high priest
[1:43:22] while you were born in sin
[1:43:24] you're nothing but an illegitimate child
[1:43:27] your mother had you before before you
[1:43:30] heard you heard and your father was ever
[1:43:31] married
[1:43:33] he said who can accuse me of sin
[1:43:37] Sinners disbelieving God's word in other
[1:43:39] words show me where I'm not fulfilling
[1:43:41] the word to the hilt
[1:43:44] show me where is not coming to pass just
[1:43:48] as the prophet said it would be
[1:43:54] and that's why I get some it just blows
[1:43:57] my mind sometimes when people look at
[1:43:58] brother Branham when they they find his
[1:44:00] humanity and they cast all the other
[1:44:02] things away
[1:44:05] well this is what the Pharisees did with
[1:44:08] Jesus they were looking at his Humanity
[1:44:11] where you were born in sin
[1:44:14] we weren't
[1:44:22] but look it did it not fulfill what the
[1:44:24] prophet had spoke
[1:44:26] that what we received in this hour did
[1:44:28] it not fulfill what is written in
[1:44:30] Scripture
[1:44:32] I get amazed I get really amazed at at
[1:44:35] people that wants to find fault and you
[1:44:37] can there's plenty of others you can
[1:44:38] find all kind of fault there you find
[1:44:40] people that took took their their gifts
[1:44:42] and made themselves millionaires out of
[1:44:45] it
[1:44:47] built kingdoms
[1:44:50] and this man was all for checks of 1.5
[1:44:52] million dollars
[1:44:54] for one healing
[1:44:58] one healing he was given a check and he
[1:45:00] turned it all down
[1:45:04] he even tried to turn down an offer and
[1:45:07] Brother Moore taken up and and then he
[1:45:09] tried to turn it down and it's 20 some
[1:45:11] thousand dollars he's he tried to turn
[1:45:13] it down said I didn't come here for an
[1:45:14] offering I come here to see people set
[1:45:17] free and delivered

[1:48:51] king and the Lord of lords you were
[1:48:53] under my feet
[1:49:01] he's come to eat the fruit of faith
[1:49:04] faith in the word
[1:49:06] he said the devil's still eating see the
[1:49:08] word's been translated so many times he
[1:49:10] is this that and the other oh he's all
[1:49:12] this
[1:49:13] but he's trying to eat the faith in the
[1:49:16] word away
[1:49:18] and the word that's been spoken he tries
[1:49:20] to bring reasonings and doubts and
[1:49:23] unbelief and
[1:49:25] all kinds of things
[1:49:27] like I said Wednesday night when all
[1:49:29] that thing happened with with Adriana
[1:49:31] the devil immediately started trying to
[1:49:34] work on my mind saying ah it wasn't that
[1:49:36] bad
[1:49:37] it wasn't that big a deal you're making
[1:49:40] it more than what it was
[1:49:42] no God made it what it is
[1:49:45] a miracle
[1:49:50] and so he tries to eat at all those
[1:49:52] things he tries to eat off he's another
[1:49:55] fruit he tries to eat is the joy of
[1:49:57] salvation
[1:50:00] oh shh you people make too much noise
[1:50:06] you people make too much noise he said
[1:50:08] how oh how can you preach when they're
[1:50:10] doing like that brother Brown he said he
[1:50:13] said I hope you understand how in the
[1:50:15] world can I preach he said listen if
[1:50:18] they didn't enjoy it I wouldn't be
[1:50:20] preaching it
[1:50:23] he said I used to have a friend of mine
[1:50:25] Jim Poole and I used to have an old dog
[1:50:27] call him Fritz so this old dog he'd go
[1:50:29] anything that was tree but a skunk he
[1:50:32] was afraid of a skunk because he smelled
[1:50:33] so bad he said I got him a skunk under a
[1:50:36] brushed pile only thing I had to do was
[1:50:38] Pat him a little bit and say sick him
[1:50:40] boy
[1:50:41] singing boy he said until he got him
[1:50:43] tree he said what so we find out amen
[1:50:46] he's trying to take the joy he said but
[1:50:49] all we need is some people to realize
[1:50:51] hey the pastor's got a skunk under the
[1:50:54] wood pile he's got one there calling and
[1:50:57] trying to get out come on sinking boy
[1:51:04] I remember being in a church there in I
[1:51:06] believe in South Carolina and I was
[1:51:08] preaching along and I've got on someone
[1:51:10] remember what it was all of a sudden a
[1:51:12] black brother that stood up in the back
[1:51:14] and he said there that devil is deal
[1:51:16] with him a while
[1:51:18] amen we need some people that'll say hey
[1:51:20] there he is let's get him let's don't
[1:51:23] allow him to live another moment his
[1:51:25] time has come
[1:51:27] deal with him kick him out don't let him
[1:51:30] have another moment
[1:51:35] seek him get after him
[1:51:37] that's the way he took away the joy
[1:51:40] David time one time said he had lost the
[1:51:43] joy of his salary for salvation he
[1:51:45] didn't lose his salvation he lost the
[1:51:48] joy of it
[1:51:50] he got Lord restore unto me the joy of
[1:51:54] my salvation the joy the joy
[1:52:00] he's supposed to have joy in church

[1:52:09] having Joy at a ball game
[1:52:15] heaven
[1:52:16] Joy Lick It Up
[1:52:22] you notice the devil wouldn't tell you
[1:52:24] then you don't need to have so much joy
[1:52:29] but he knows when you get to the Joy
[1:52:31] bringer
[1:52:34] you don't need that much
[1:52:37] you just got no don't don't go that far
[1:52:40] don't go into that no no that's good
[1:52:42] you're going to go too far he wasn't
[1:52:44] worried about you going too far at a
[1:52:46] ball game or too far in drugs or too far
[1:52:49] and drinking or too foreign sexual thing
[1:52:51] he wasn't worried about that
[1:52:53] go as far as you want
[1:52:56] but all of a sudden about the things of
[1:52:58] God we start hearing him you're going
[1:53:00] too far
[1:53:03] trying to take the joy
[1:53:06] eat the fruit of the joy now look at
[1:53:08] here you people make too much noise I
[1:53:10] tell you all this crying and saying amen
[1:53:11] and shouting that's nonsense
[1:53:13] there's nothing to that
[1:53:15] he said you'll say that and the first
[1:53:17] thing you know you're sitting in a big
[1:53:19] morgue
[1:53:21] and you're sitting there all of them
[1:53:23] dead some of these embalming fluids of
[1:53:25] so-called doctrines of Creeds pumped in
[1:53:27] their veins where the spirit of God
[1:53:30] ought to be running whether old church
[1:53:32] Creed pumped in there no wonder their
[1:53:34] ice and cold and dead spiritual
[1:53:36] thermometer the 90 below zero yes

[1:53:40] stretched their neck around some kind of
[1:53:42] goose or something want to know who said
[1:53:43] it it's a shame when the spirit of God
[1:53:46] ought to be joy peace and love but this

[1:54:26] be saved you have to have to have that
[1:54:28] oh my that would take the joy out of
[1:54:31] anything

[1:54:52] Royal Blood that's flowing through my
[1:54:54] vein it ain't some man's Creed or Dogma

[1:55:17] in it by Creed by dogmas by any kind of
[1:55:20] good work you're not going to get in the
[1:55:22] only way you're going to get in is how
[1:55:23] the bringer brought it and he brought it
[1:55:26] by the Holy Spirit and he said You shall
[1:55:28] repent and be baptized and be filled
[1:55:31] with the spirit of God
[1:55:34] that's the way the bringer brought it
[1:55:37] any other way is a hybrid
[1:55:39] and you're not born correctly
[1:55:43] amen
[1:55:45] there's a little insect
[1:55:49] old green tooth beetle
[1:55:51] by the time I get through this he gonna
[1:55:53] have all kind of names
[1:55:56] he eat all the peace of mind off
[1:55:59] well
[1:56:01] just don't have nobody that loves me
[1:56:03] nobody cares for me
[1:56:07] you're talking about people been
[1:56:09] knocking your door down trying to text
[1:56:10] you
[1:56:13] trying to show God's love
[1:56:16] and you still say there ain't nobody
[1:56:18] loves you
[1:56:19] God does
[1:56:21] he apparently he's got some children who
[1:56:23] do
[1:56:25] I know where I'm at
[1:56:27] amen we get all this peace of mind going
[1:56:30] and we we get all stirred up and rumbled
[1:56:32] rumbled up about something listen we
[1:56:34] need to come back to where he brought it
[1:56:38] he said I'll bring bring you peace not
[1:56:40] the peace that the world can give
[1:56:44] so if the world didn't give this peace
[1:56:46] the world can't take it away
[1:56:48] hallelujah amen the devil can bring it
[1:56:51] to me God brought it to me so if God
[1:56:53] brought it to me ain't nobody can do
[1:56:55] nothing about it I can hold my peace in
[1:56:58] the middle of my storm
[1:57:04] it's what he told the children of Israel
[1:57:06] at the Crossing of the Red Sea hold your
[1:57:08] peace
[1:57:09] I know one one thought is keep your
[1:57:11] mouth shut or speak the right thing and
[1:57:13] that's a wonderful thought but also
[1:57:15] during your storms you can hold your
[1:57:17] peace
[1:57:19] you can hold it very closely knowing
[1:57:21] that while you're in the storm and if
[1:57:23] you're in a storm that doesn't mean he
[1:57:24] ain't left you or that he's left you or
[1:57:27] you're all alone or you're by yourself
[1:57:28] no if you're in the middle of the storm
[1:57:30] that means he's still with me he's still
[1:57:32] in the boat he's still here he's still
[1:57:35] moving he's still making a way where
[1:57:36] there seems to be no way he is still
[1:57:39] orchestrating everything according to
[1:57:41] his will for my good
[1:57:51] then it tears off Fellowship
[1:57:54] brings that down
[1:57:56] with all these weird feelings that goes
[1:57:58] on time to put our weird feelings aside
[1:58:02] and just fall in love with Jesus and
[1:58:05] then fall in love with Jesus you fall in
[1:58:07] love with his people
[1:58:14] listen to this this blew my mind I guess
[1:58:16] I've heard it before but when I read it
[1:58:18] again it just gives you quite the
[1:58:20] picture
[1:58:21] it talks about the nazarenes and the
[1:58:23] lutherans and the Presbyterians and the
[1:58:25] pilgrim Holiness and the and the
[1:58:27] Pentecostals and all that he said I've
[1:58:29] seen her the other night
[1:58:32] the whole thing her pastor laying on top
[1:58:36] kissing a corpse making love to it
[1:58:43] said they ain't got no more time anyhow
[1:58:45] this is all of it he said my but God
[1:58:48] planted a tree to bring forth spiritual
[1:58:51] fruit
[1:58:56] s of his Spirit fruits of Joy love
[1:58:58] happiness fruits of the Holy Ghost
[1:59:02] but man has always tried to take the
[1:59:04] spiritual church and make it into an
[1:59:07] artificial form
[1:59:10] Luther had a spiritual church
[1:59:12] he goes into what they do they turn it
[1:59:14] into an artificial form John Wesley a
[1:59:17] great man of God had a spiritual church
[1:59:19] but as soon as he went off the scene
[1:59:20] they turned it into an artificial form
[1:59:23] and what he thinks trying to happen even
[1:59:25] in all ranks
[1:59:29] listen as we've heard it brother Branham
[1:59:31] left the car running
[1:59:33] the Dynamics and the mechanics are here
[1:59:36] but a bunch of quack mechanics get in
[1:59:39] there and they start filling with this
[1:59:40] and filling with that just leave it
[1:59:42] running
[1:59:43] leave it running it'll go down to the
[1:59:45] Holy Ghost it'll go down a Divine healer
[1:59:48] it'll run over every devil in hell
[1:59:59] I thought about this here again the
[2:00:01] other night
[2:00:02] a couple it's been a while back was
[2:00:04] driving to church
[2:00:06] and it was coming up to Cotton Valley
[2:00:08] coming that way so it's been a while
[2:00:10] because that bridge been out a while
[2:00:12] but anyway I'm driving along and out of
[2:00:15] the corner of my eyes see a snake just
[2:00:17] come out onto the road before I could
[2:00:18] even Flinch or anything right over it
[2:00:22] I said well I didn't see that coming
[2:00:25] sister Ruth sitting over there she said
[2:00:27] I think the worst thing is or maybe the
[2:00:29] other thing is he didn't see you coming
[2:00:34] and I'm thinking about this thought on
[2:00:36] treading on serpents
[2:00:38] listen you go put your foot on a serpent
[2:00:40] it's going to bite you
[2:00:43] you put your own flesh on it it's going
[2:00:46] to rare up and it's going to bite you
[2:00:47] but I'm not coming in my power
[2:00:51] I'm coming in a different Power the
[2:00:53] spirit of not by might not my power but
[2:00:55] by the spirit of God Amen there's a car
[2:00:58] that you can get in that'll run over
[2:01:00] every devil
[2:01:03] amen you might say well I didn't see
[2:01:05] that coming well the worst thing he
[2:01:06] didn't see you coming
[2:01:08] amen he didn't see that it wasn't just
[2:01:10] you coming down the highway but there
[2:01:12] was a power that was greater that was
[2:01:14] carrying you over the serpent it was
[2:01:17] carrying you over the trial that was
[2:01:19] carrying you over the sickness that was
[2:01:21] carrying you over the trouble there is a
[2:01:24] power in the Church of the Living God
[2:01:29] and he will bring you to your victory
[2:01:33] he will bring you to the season of life
[2:01:38] listen he's not only going to just bring
[2:01:40] the season to you he's going to bring
[2:01:42] you to the season
[2:01:44] when you don't have the strength and you
[2:01:46] don't have the ability God rich in Mercy
[2:01:49] just like we heard when we was dead and
[2:01:51] sins and trespasses we were laying face
[2:01:54] down in a flood and the devil had
[2:01:56] destroyed our life but God come walking
[2:01:58] on the flood and he reached down and he
[2:02:01] picked us up and he carried us back to
[2:02:03] somewhere we could stand on and he put
[2:02:06] us down and he began to breathe a life
[2:02:09] eternal life into our bodies that's why
[2:02:11] we can believe what we believe that's
[2:02:13] why we can trust how we trust that's why
[2:02:15] we can have the peace that we have
[2:02:17] that's why we can have the joy joy
[2:02:19] unspeakable and full of Glory because
[2:02:21] it's not my life I live by the life of
[2:02:24] Jesus Christ
[2:02:25] [Applause]
[2:02:33] he said it's come down to a bunch of
[2:02:35] Tommy rot
[2:02:36] it's a form of godliness
[2:02:40] the Bible says in the last days I have a
[2:02:42] form of godliness
[2:02:45] but deny the power
[2:02:49] hello
[2:02:52] God don't do like he used to do this is
[2:02:55] not the season of Miracles you deny her
[2:03:01] you traitor
[2:03:10] Paul and saw you coming
[2:03:12] in the last days perilous times shall
[2:03:14] come men will be lovers of their own
[2:03:16] self proud black boasters blasphemers
[2:03:19] disobedient unthankful Unholy without
[2:03:21] natural affection and kindness despise
[2:03:23] are those that are good traitors oh yeah
[2:03:25] Traders
[2:03:27] Now understand why he called them
[2:03:29] traitors I minded
[2:03:31] having a form of godliness ain't that a
[2:03:34] paradox
[2:03:36] somebody that's a blasphemer disobedient
[2:03:38] unthankful Unholy without natural
[2:03:40] affection incontinent despise those are
[2:03:42] good traitors high-minded but having a
[2:03:45] form of godliness
[2:03:48] what deny the power thereof
[2:03:55] brother Timothy
[2:03:57] the picture
[2:03:58] looks very bleak
[2:04:01] but it ain't over
[2:04:05] the author flips the script
[2:04:09] he turns the chapter and he says but
[2:04:11] I'll see all this desolation I see all
[2:04:14] of this but I'm going to bring
[2:04:17] restoration
[2:04:19] and all the years that the canker worm
[2:04:22] the Palmer worm and the locusts and all
[2:04:25] that is taken and destroyed I'm going to
[2:04:27] restore
[2:04:31] I'm going to bring it back to what it
[2:04:34] should be
[2:04:36] oh God I'm so thankful it's not this is
[2:04:38] not depending the Rapture is not
[2:04:41] depending on fickle men
[2:04:44] because fickleman will put you in and
[2:04:46] put you out they'll put you up one day
[2:04:48] and tear you down the next but if God
[2:04:51] loved you ever he loves you forever and
[2:04:54] if God ever cared about you he still
[2:04:56] cares about you
[2:04:58] oh if he was a son at the beginning or a
[2:05:02] daughter at the beginning you'll be one
[2:05:04] at the end it doesn't matter what
[2:05:06] they've done in Missouri he said I'm
[2:05:07] going to bring you
[2:05:12] I'm going to bring you to the promise
[2:05:16] even Sarah when you didn't have the
[2:05:18] faith to believe it I'm going to bring
[2:05:19] you to it
[2:05:21] even when you laughed at it I'm going to
[2:05:24] bring you to it
[2:05:26] because you're my child
[2:05:28] I traded many nations for you
[2:05:33] hello
[2:05:34] he had the opportunity
[2:05:37] Satan gave him so I'll give you all the
[2:05:39] kingdoms
[2:05:40] he didn't want all of them he wanted you
[2:05:45] he wants you this morning and he said
[2:05:48] I'm going to bring you
[2:05:54] to the place
[2:05:57] we know there's another story brother
[2:05:59] Brandon talks about
[2:06:00] being up there in the wilderness and
[2:06:02] getting turned around and got lost at
[2:06:04] night
[2:06:05] and he got there in that big old burn
[2:06:07] over patch in the Moonlight and the wind
[2:06:10] blowing through the air
[2:06:12] I was making that
[2:06:13] say I've heard it it's it is spooky I
[2:06:16] heard it during the day and it was
[2:06:17] spooky enough
[2:06:19] couldn't imagine what it'd be in the
[2:06:20] moonlit night
[2:06:22] I mean brother Doug Baker was sitting on
[2:06:25] the side of Mount Lemmon had been burned
[2:06:27] over a few years and watching looking
[2:06:29] over Tucson and the wind coming up that
[2:06:31] Valley hit the most snag
[2:06:33] [Music]
[2:06:37] I can still almost feel the hair pulling
[2:06:40] up
[2:06:42] could you imagine being out by yourself
[2:06:45] and God wants to show you something
[2:06:48] can we see it in the daylight
[2:06:53] but no he wants to show him and he
[2:06:55] brings him to this place
[2:06:57] said it was a spooky looking place
[2:06:58] looked like a graveyard the wind would
[2:07:00] come down and it began to hit and they'd
[2:07:02] go hmm just a mournful sound
[2:07:05] stood and looked at a little bit
[2:07:08] and I thought of this scripture right
[2:07:09] here Joel chapter 2. these trees Put Me
[2:07:12] In Mind of some of these great big fire
[2:07:14] inspired churches
[2:07:16] sitting there just as beautiful as they
[2:07:17] can be but just as dead as a doornail
[2:07:20] even the Palmer arm and eat all the bark
[2:07:22] off of them and fire trials and blazed
[2:07:24] all the spirit away it was nothing left
[2:07:26] but a big statue just as dead as it can
[2:07:30] be and when the bright Mighty rushing
[2:07:32] wind from Heaven would come the only
[2:07:34] thing they would do was groan and Say It
[2:07:37] Ain't So and they would say days of
[2:07:39] Miracles are passed
[2:07:45] you traitor you dead snag
[2:07:48] days of Miracles are passed just every
[2:07:52] time God sends a Revival signs and
[2:07:54] wonders begin to come up and fall among
[2:07:56] the people and the things they say all
[2:07:58] the days Americans have passed what the
[2:08:00] Palmer wearing left the caterpillar
[2:08:01] eating what the Methodist left the
[2:08:03] Baptist scene what the Baptist left the
[2:08:04] Presbyterian or the Presbyterian left
[2:08:06] the Pentecostal was eaten until his God
[2:08:08] to such a place it stripped the tree of
[2:08:11] everything as God all the power all the
[2:08:14] joy all the good things that God was to
[2:08:16] bring to his church on the day of
[2:08:18] Pentecost they tore it all out and
[2:08:20] there's nothing left but a big church
[2:08:22] name
[2:08:28] brother let me tell you what this world
[2:08:30] needs tonight
[2:08:34] he said that old tree is standing there
[2:08:36] oh we got a name
[2:08:38] we got a tree he once was a tree but
[2:08:40] what about now
[2:08:42] he said that's the Pentecostal Church
[2:08:43] too
[2:08:45] he said the hardest kick I ever got
[2:08:47] about Divine Healing was from an
[2:08:50] Assembly of God man
[2:08:53] I wonder how hard a message person would
[2:08:55] kick him
[2:08:57] it's the truth
[2:09:00] you know we had I was talking about this
[2:09:03] other day we had our family Camp I think
[2:09:04] the first year and it was some
[2:09:06] volunteers that was on the campground
[2:09:08] they got a memorial there buddy Robinson
[2:09:10] had preached there let me saw that
[2:09:13] yeah it's there and and so uh we was in
[2:09:16] service and the spirit of God began to
[2:09:18] move and some of the volunteers had come
[2:09:20] into that service and one of them went
[2:09:22] out and began to weep so I think it was
[2:09:23] to brother Daryl and said we used to
[2:09:25] have Services just like this
[2:09:30] but it's all laid off
[2:09:37] we had Armory down in Hot Springs
[2:09:39] Arkansas couldn't have enough seats we
[2:09:41] had several thousand people he had a
[2:09:43] great big lot of Siege anybody that
[2:09:45] believed in Divine Healing couldn't even
[2:09:46] sit in his seats what a shame
[2:09:48] what a shame what's the matter what the
[2:09:51] Palm worm left the caterpillar eat the
[2:09:53] Baptist took the shouting away from the
[2:09:55] Methodist one ate this and one ate that
[2:09:57] until they strip the church down until
[2:09:58] they got them just as dead as a doornail
[2:10:01] no Spirit no shouting no joy no peace no
[2:10:05] healing no nothing
[2:10:08] what the Methodist left the baptism was
[2:10:10] the Baptiste the caterpillar eating some
[2:10:12] other church and this one he did this
[2:10:14] and took that away and this took that
[2:10:15] away we got nothing left but just a
[2:10:17] kirch's Creed well one left another knee
[2:10:20] until you got nothing but a big dead
[2:10:22] tree
[2:10:25] and he said every time God sends a big
[2:10:27] rush of Glory down well I don't believe
[2:10:30] in it psychology this that and the other
[2:10:32] dead from The Roots up twice dead
[2:10:35] plucked up by the roots it's a sad
[2:10:37] looking day
[2:10:38] but he said when Joel looked at that and
[2:10:40] saw that he said but God said I will
[2:10:43] restore
[2:10:45] Hallelujah I will bring it to pass I
[2:10:49] will bring it right back to what he
[2:10:51] wanted at the beginning he said it
[2:10:53] happened to look that night when the
[2:10:54] wind was blowing there how stiff and
[2:10:56] starch and dead sitting there moaning
[2:10:58] and groaning didn't have no life to bend
[2:11:00] with it the bark wasn't flexible no more
[2:11:02] mourning and groaning on the account of
[2:11:05] the wind Dr so and so Dr so-and-so said
[2:11:07] but it happened to notice underneath
[2:11:10] there was some undergrowth coming up
[2:11:13] some little bushes about like that they
[2:11:16] had life in them and when the wind began
[2:11:18] to hit them they started twisting and
[2:11:20] ringing and shouting and having a
[2:11:22] glorious time let me tell you brother
[2:11:24] God is going to raise up a generation of
[2:11:27] people out of all this dead stuff
[2:11:30] that's going to go into a restoration
[2:11:33] that's the saith the Lord
[2:11:38] God's going to raise up a people who
[2:11:41] believe in signs and wonders
[2:11:43] God's going to raise up a people who's
[2:11:46] got joy unspeakable and full of glory
[2:11:48] and when the Russian Mighty winds come
[2:11:51] it'll give right to it it'll flock it'll
[2:11:54] dance whatever it's going to do it's
[2:11:56] going to glorify God because if you knew
[2:11:58] what I knew and what it's done for me
[2:12:02] you'd be shouting too you'd be
[2:12:04] glorifying God you would give him praise
[2:12:08] you would shout hallelujah there would
[2:12:10] be something on the inside of you I once
[2:12:13] was lost I once was laying dead in my
[2:12:16] sin but the grace of God picked me up
[2:12:19] [Applause]
[2:12:24] green leaves clapping their hands
[2:12:32] green leaves dancing and glorifying God
[2:12:36] what a frolic
[2:12:38] that little under listen to this
[2:12:41] that little undergrowth was having but
[2:12:44] that big old tree standing there at the
[2:12:46] same time moaning and groaning same wind
[2:12:57] same when
[2:13:03] the same wind was making one moan
[2:13:06] and groan was given another a big time
[2:13:11] hallelujah what I happen to think well
[2:13:14] what is this doing
[2:13:16] that wind was moving through and it's
[2:13:19] pulling them roots and loosen the ground
[2:13:20] so that little tree could grow deeper
[2:13:22] and get a better hole he said every time
[2:13:25] God sends his blessings His blessings
[2:13:27] upon born-again men and women it only
[2:13:30] loosens up the roots for them to grow
[2:13:32] deeper and higher and better and Freer
[2:13:36] and glorify God more I will restore
[2:13:40] saith the Lord
[2:13:42] I will bring this to flesh
[2:13:47] it was four death Messengers
[2:13:53] and he said listen real close four death
[2:13:55] Messengers killed the tree Palm worm
[2:13:57] Locus king of worm caterpillar four
[2:13:59] messengers of Roman devils
[2:14:03] Roman dogmas killed that tree one took
[2:14:07] his fruit one took his bark one took his
[2:14:10] Leafs one took his life
[2:14:13] four messengers of Dogma killed the tree
[2:14:17] all but the root
[2:14:22] because there was a word hanging over
[2:14:24] that tree
[2:14:26] it says I'm going to have a bride
[2:14:30] I'm gonna have a bride without spot with
[2:14:32] a wrinkling those that are alive and
[2:14:34] remain
[2:14:36] there was a word hanging over that root
[2:14:39] there was a word hanging there that was
[2:14:41] spoke over what the caterpillar could do
[2:14:44] and the palm of worm could see the devil
[2:14:46] can only go so far
[2:14:48] he's got a leash or the Bible would talk
[2:14:50] about a bridle he puts a bridle in his
[2:14:52] mouth in other words God's got the
[2:14:54] controls of him
[2:14:56] the devil my arms want to get you I'm
[2:14:58] going to get you I'm going to get you
[2:14:59] and he gets so close
[2:15:01] the next thing he knows he's heading a
[2:15:03] different direction
[2:15:05] why because somebody else has got him in
[2:15:08] control
[2:15:10] oh
[2:15:13] you may feel like you're you're headed
[2:15:15] to destruction and the devil is hot on
[2:15:17] your Trails but what you need to do is
[2:15:19] run to the rock that is higher than we
[2:15:21] are
[2:15:22] run as hard as you can and when you feel
[2:15:24] that Hound of death on the hill Hills
[2:15:26] don't worry there's somebody behind him
[2:15:28] that's got him in control and God is
[2:15:31] only trying to get you to a certain
[2:15:32] place at a certain time in a certain
[2:15:35] season to receive something for him
[2:15:40] you go through drought so you can enjoy
[2:15:42] times of plenty
[2:15:45] there's Seasons God doesn't always bring
[2:15:47] you know people think well I get the
[2:15:49] Holy Ghost and it's all over with it's
[2:15:51] just nothing but joy bells or Heaven no
[2:15:53] you're going to have trials you're going
[2:15:54] to go through things in your life you're
[2:15:56] going to go through valleys but you go
[2:15:58] through the valley so when you get on
[2:16:00] top of the hills you can shout and
[2:16:02] praise God and say look what God brought
[2:16:04] me through
[2:16:06] look I thought I was going to be
[2:16:07] destroyed down there but God rich in
[2:16:10] Mercy reached down and lifted me and he
[2:16:12] brought me to a high place
[2:16:19] I will restore
[2:16:21] death Messengers had killed it before
[2:16:24] life Messengers would restore it
[2:16:27] foreign
[2:16:28] who was it Martin Luther with
[2:16:31] justification John Wesley was
[2:16:33] sanctification Pentecost brought the
[2:16:35] restoration of the gifts and the Holy
[2:16:38] Spirit brings the baptism of the Holy
[2:16:39] Ghost
[2:16:42] amen the word
[2:16:45] four great prophets four Great Men
[2:16:47] bringing the church Reeves and bringing
[2:16:49] it back to life again for the first time
[2:16:52] out of the Dead out of the Dead Earth
[2:16:55] came a little stalk
[2:16:57] and it came into a tassel and it came
[2:16:59] into a shut and now it's in deceit again
[2:17:03] because a word had spoke the devil tried
[2:17:06] to destroy it but the word is spoke
[2:17:09] the devil tried to eat it all down and
[2:17:11] eat all the life out of it but the word
[2:17:12] it spoke
[2:17:14] the word speaks over your situation
[2:17:18] it's just like it was with uh Ezekiel
