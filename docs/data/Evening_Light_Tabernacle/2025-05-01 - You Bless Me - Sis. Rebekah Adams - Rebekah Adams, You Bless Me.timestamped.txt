[0:01] [Music]
[0:13] Every time I think of your
[0:17] kindness. Every time I'm singing your
[0:20] name,
[0:22] Jesus. I never thought my life could
[0:25] look like
[0:26] this. I give thanks every day for your
[0:32] amazing
[0:34] grace. And God, I'm in love with who you
[0:40] are. You are the bright and morning
[0:45] star. You fill me with joy inside of my
[0:50] heart. You bless me. You bless me.
[0:56] When I look at how far you brought
[1:01] me, nothing I could do to
[1:04] [Music]
[1:06] deserve. And when I was a sinner, you
[1:09] called
[1:10] me. And I'm alive by your side because
[1:15] you love me,
[1:17] Lord. And God, I'm in love with who you
[1:22] are.
[1:24] You are the bright and morning star. You
[1:29] fill me with joy inside of my heart. You
[1:34] bless me. You bless
[1:37] me. Oh, when everything seems
[1:44] impossible. You are my peace through
[1:47] every storm.
[1:50] You are the God of
[1:54] miracles. You bless me. You bless
[2:04] me. Thank
[2:07] you.
[2:09] Hallelujah. Thank
[2:12] you. Hallelu.
[2:16] Thank you for all that you have
[2:24] done.
[2:26] Hallelujah. Thank
[2:29] you.
[2:32] Halleluah. Thank
[2:35] you.
[2:37] Hallelu. Thank you for all that you have
[2:44] done.
[2:48] [Music]
[2:50] And God, I'm in love with who you
[2:55] are. You are the bright morning star.
[3:01] You fill me with joy inside of my heart.
[3:06] You bless me. You bless me.
[3:11] And when everything seems
[3:16] impossible, you are my peace through
[3:20] every
[3:22] storm. You are the God of
[3:27] miracle. You bless me. You bless
[3:30] me.
[3:32] Oh, and God, I'm in love with who you
[3:37] are.
[3:39] You are the bright morning star. You
[3:44] fill me with joy inside of my heart. You
[3:49] bless me. You bless
[3:53] me when everything seems
[3:59] impossible. You are my peace through
[4:03] every
[4:04] storm. And you are the God of
[4:10] miracles. You bless me. You bless me.
