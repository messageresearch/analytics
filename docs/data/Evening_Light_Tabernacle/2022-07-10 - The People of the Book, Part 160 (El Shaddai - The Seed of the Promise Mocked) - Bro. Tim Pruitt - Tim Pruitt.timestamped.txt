[28:32] starts with you how many could say lord
[28:33] take control of me
[28:35] amen father we come to you today lord
[28:39] lord just asking your father to come and
[28:42] let your presence just sweep into this
[28:44] place lord
[28:46] lord the atmosphere i believe has
[28:47] already started to be created that all
[28:50] things are possible
[28:52] that you can move in impossibilities
[28:55] lord that man may say is impossible
[28:57] doctors may say is impossible but lord
[28:59] there's nothing impossible with you and

[54:49] and at the set time of which god has
[54:51] spoken to him
[54:53] and abraham called the name of his son
[54:55] that was born unto him whom sarah bare
[54:58] to him isaac meaning laughter god hath
[55:03] made me to rejoice
[55:05] and abraham circumcised his son isaac
[55:08] being eight days old and as god
[55:11] commanded him
[55:12] and abraham was a hundred years old when
[55:14] his son
[55:15] isaac was born unto him and sarah said
[55:19] god hath made me to laugh
[55:21] so that all that here will laugh with me
[55:25] and she said who would have said unto
[55:27] abraham that sarah should have given
[55:30] children suck if i have borne him a son
[55:34] in his old age
[55:36] and as a child grew and was weaned and
[55:39] abraham made a great feast
[55:42] the same day that isaac was weaned
[55:45] and sarah saw the son of hagar the
[55:49] egyptian which he had born unto abraham
[55:52] mocking
[55:53] wherefore she said unto abraham cast out
[55:56] this bonds woman and her son
[55:59] for the son of this bondswoman will
[56:02] shall not be heir with my son even with
[56:05] isaac
[56:06] and the thing was very grievous in
[56:08] abraham's sight because of his son
[56:11] and god said unto abraham let it not be
[56:14] grievous in thy sight because of the lad
[56:17] and because of thy bonds woman
[56:19] but in all that sarah hath said unto
[56:22] thee hearken unto her voice
[56:25] for in isaac shall thy seed be called
[56:29] and also of the son of the bondwoman
[56:31] will i make a nation because he is thy
[56:34] seed
[56:35] and abraham rose up early in the morning
[56:38] and took bread and the bottle of water
[56:40] and gave it unto hagar putting it on her
[56:42] shoulder and the child and sent her away
[56:45] and she departed and wandered in the
[56:47] wilderness of beersheba
[56:50] and the water was spent in the bottle
[56:52] and she cast a child under one of the
[56:55] shrubs
[56:56] and she went and sat down over against
[56:59] him a good way off
[57:01] as it were a beau shot for she said let
[57:04] me not see the death of the child and
[57:08] and she sat over against him and lift up
[57:10] her voice and well
[57:12] and god heard the voice of the lad and
[57:14] the angel of god called to hagar out of
[57:17] heaven and said unto her what aileth
[57:19] thee hagar fear not god hath heard the
[57:22] voice of the lad where he is
[57:25] arise lift up the ladder hold him in
[57:28] thine hand for i will make him a great
[57:31] nation
[57:32] and god opened her eyes and she saw a
[57:35] well of water
[57:37] and she went and filled the water bottle
[57:39] with water and gave the lad drink amen
[57:43] god bless you can be seated
[57:45] we're going to be speaking on this
[57:47] morning of the
[57:48] the seed of the promise mocked so it's
[57:52] again about el shaddai and the
[57:55] visitation of the almighty and
[57:58] the events that surround it and i want
[58:00] you to remember this is a part of
[58:01] prophecy
[58:03] so just as much as the rest of it is
[58:05] prophecy you know that this also is
[58:08] prophetical
[58:10] and i i want you to
[58:12] note that this will exactly happen it
[58:15] will cause a separation
[58:18] in the body
[58:20] you see they were all one body all
[58:23] called one seed of abraham and a whole
[58:26] church of abraham believers
[58:29] but when isaac was born and then the
[58:32] seed of abraham which was isaac was
[58:35] mocked the promise was mocked then there
[58:38] came a separation now it wasn't just
[58:40] human separation god himself did the
[58:44] separating
[58:46] god came along and said listen to what
[58:48] sarah said
[58:49] because the this child will not be heir
[58:53] with the
[58:54] this child of the promise will not be
[58:56] heir with the child of the bombs woman
[58:59] so this is prophecy remember the message
[59:02] the rapture brother branham spends the
[59:03] first half of that speaking about the
[59:06] scorners and the scoffers
[59:08] that is all a part of the rapture hour
[59:11] so they must be here
[59:14] now so it's going to be your attitude
[59:16] toward the promise of god
[59:18] that will identify who you are
[59:22] now if you'll turn with me to romans 14
[59:25] 17 i'm just going to use this for a
[59:27] foundation here
[59:29] i want to divert for a moment read a
[59:31] couple more scriptures to give me uh
[59:34] some background for what i want to speak
[59:36] on
[59:37] but um i want you to see romans 4 17
[59:40] tells us what the kingdom of god is
[59:44] and he said the kingdom of god is not
[59:46] meat and drink
[59:48] which is in that case was religious
[59:51] forms rules and regulations
[59:54] but righteousness peace and joy in the
[59:58] holy ghost
[1:00:03] so the kingdom of god is not meat and
[1:00:05] drink but righteousness
[1:00:07] peace and joy in the holy ghost so let's
[1:00:11] just take it like this and we're going
[1:00:13] to say the kingdom of god
[1:00:15] is the holy ghost
[1:00:20] the kingdom of god is the holy ghost now
[1:00:23] i have a reason for going here before we
[1:00:25] go to my next scripture
[1:00:27] let's go to
[1:00:29] the bible and let's turn to the matthew
[1:00:31] chapter 22 and verse 2
[1:00:34] and we're going to see the kingdom of
[1:00:36] heaven is the kingdom of god
[1:00:39] and it is righteousness peace and joy in
[1:00:41] the holy ghost it is life in the holy
[1:00:44] ghost so when you see the kingdom of
[1:00:46] heaven or the kingdom of god in the
[1:00:48] bible it is describing life in the holy
[1:00:52] ghost
[1:00:53] all right
[1:00:54] now so this is
[1:00:56] this is now a parable that jesus gives
[1:00:59] and he says life in the holy ghost as
[1:01:02] the holy ghost reigns
[1:01:04] there's going to be
[1:01:05] something that happens
[1:01:07] it's going to be likened to a king which
[1:01:10] made a marriage for his son
[1:01:13] and sent forth his servants to call them
[1:01:15] which forbidden
[1:01:17] and to the wedding and they would not
[1:01:19] come
[1:01:20] again he sent forth other servants and
[1:01:23] say and tell them which are bidden
[1:01:25] um
[1:01:26] behold i have prepared my dinner my oxen
[1:01:30] my fatherlands are killed and all the
[1:01:32] things are ready into the marriage
[1:01:34] remember el shaddai
[1:01:37] in our story there isaac was there was a
[1:01:40] feast made
[1:01:41] and there was an invitation given
[1:01:44] but now there's a mocking of the seed
[1:01:47] during the time of the feast
[1:01:50] jesus said in the kingdom of heaven are
[1:01:53] in the realm of the holy ghost when it
[1:01:55] is being poured out there's going to be
[1:01:58] a feast
[1:01:59] that is going to be prepared
[1:02:02] and there's going to be bidding to come
[1:02:05] to that feast but notice he says but
[1:02:08] they made
[1:02:09] light a bit
[1:02:11] they mocked it
[1:02:13] and went their way one to his farm
[1:02:16] another to his merchandise and the
[1:02:18] remnant took his servants and entreated
[1:02:21] them spitefully and
[1:02:23] threw them so there's a persecution
[1:02:26] but then when the king
[1:02:28] heard thereof he was wrought sent forth
[1:02:31] his armies destroyed those murders
[1:02:33] burned up their city
[1:02:35] and then he said to his servants the
[1:02:37] wedding is ready but they which were
[1:02:39] bidden were not worthy
[1:02:42] so go ye therefore into the highways and
[1:02:45] as many as you shall find bid to the
[1:02:48] marriage so that those servants went out
[1:02:51] on the highways and gathered together as
[1:02:54] many as they found both good
[1:02:56] bad and good and the wedding was
[1:02:58] furnished with guests
[1:03:00] god's going to have somebody
[1:03:04] amen it's a celebration feast
[1:03:06] and when the king came in to see his
[1:03:09] guests watch now he still sees further
[1:03:12] mockery he sees a man
[1:03:15] which had which there which had not
[1:03:18] owned a wedding garment
[1:03:21] you see he didn't take seriously
[1:03:24] what he was being invited to
[1:03:27] and he didn't prepare for the feast
[1:03:30] which again is mocking
[1:03:32] and he said unto him friend how come
[1:03:35] this thou hid her not having a wedding
[1:03:38] garment and he was speechless
[1:03:42] and then said the king to the servants
[1:03:44] bind him hand and foot and take him away
[1:03:48] and cast him in the outer darkness and
[1:03:51] there shall be weeping and gnashing of
[1:03:53] teeth for many are called but few are
[1:03:55] chosen
[1:03:57] you see the the consequences was the
[1:04:00] same cast out the bonds woman she went
[1:04:02] into the wilderness where there was
[1:04:05] wailing and gnashing of teeth
[1:04:08] amen amen and cast out into outer
[1:04:12] darkness into the wilderness
[1:04:14] because of the attitude toward the feast
[1:04:20] now abraham and his and sarah had met
[1:04:22] the almighty god
[1:04:24] and to them a miracle was promised and
[1:04:27] god had had come to bring them strength
[1:04:30] to give them a faith to bring forth even
[1:04:33] though sarah was 99 years old and sarah
[1:04:37] was 90. remember this types are body
[1:04:40] change and it types the renewing of the
[1:04:43] body it types the renewing of the church
[1:04:46] the revival here in this last day that
[1:04:49] is promised to bring forth a bride who
[1:04:52] can reproduce christ
[1:04:55] and and so el shaddai is the type of the
[1:04:58] baptism of the holy ghost and we have
[1:05:00] been instructed to nurse our strength
[1:05:04] and refreshment from him
[1:05:07] amen because the holy ghost is the
[1:05:09] source that we get the renewing from
[1:05:14] that we get the change remember the
[1:05:16] change is not just going to happen in a
[1:05:18] moment in a twinkling of an eye that
[1:05:21] change starts from the inside out
[1:05:24] and so as as we look at this i want you
[1:05:27] to think um as brother branham
[1:05:30] it's so beautiful he said this and
[1:05:32] abraham and his seed after him he said
[1:05:34] i'm the breasted god i'm the strong one
[1:05:37] lean on my bosom now and nurse from me
[1:05:40] my strength and your weak body
[1:05:43] getting him ready for a miracle
[1:05:46] so now let's take the type again the
[1:05:48] holy ghost is given
[1:05:50] to get you ready for the miracle
[1:05:54] amen now that's what he done to the
[1:05:56] pentecostals after the western age now
[1:05:59] what miracle are we talking about it is
[1:06:01] the miracle of a new body it is a
[1:06:04] miracle of the promised son the coming
[1:06:06] of jesus christ
[1:06:08] the long-awaited son that we've been
[1:06:11] expecting now for 2 000 years
[1:06:14] now here he's offered here's what he
[1:06:17] offered the pentecostals he offered them
[1:06:19] the word in his fullness as right around
[1:06:22] 1906 the spirit of god began to be
[1:06:25] poured out
[1:06:26] upon the people in this age
[1:06:29] to bring an age to bring a people to the
[1:06:32] fullness of the word to the fullness of
[1:06:34] its power
[1:06:35] to where god could be displayed in full
[1:06:38] strength and he offered the pentecostals
[1:06:42] the word in his fullness
[1:06:44] unsealed totally unsealed totally
[1:06:48] revealed
[1:06:49] but but they chose instead speaking in
[1:06:53] tongues
[1:06:54] amen
[1:06:55] and tongues was given a place of more of
[1:06:59] more importance greater than the
[1:07:01] discernment
[1:07:03] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:07:06] which was the evidence of the word
[1:07:08] present
[1:07:10] amen and that's that was the same sign
[1:07:12] that jesus performed when the word was
[1:07:15] made flesh
[1:07:17] and and this too again was a mockery
[1:07:20] it was a making light of what god had
[1:07:24] sent in our generation
[1:07:26] and once again i want to say we have
[1:07:29] been offered god has offered us the word
[1:07:33] in its fullness
[1:07:34] the full land the complete inheritance
[1:07:38] and we don't have to limit ourselves to
[1:07:41] any one gift
[1:07:43] we don't have to limit ourselves to
[1:07:45] speaking in tongues
[1:07:47] or one gift like the pentecostals did we
[1:07:50] can have the whole land
[1:07:52] and god has offered us a full course
[1:07:55] menu
[1:07:56] because all the seven seals are open
[1:07:59] which opens the entire book to us
[1:08:02] but now watch what many have done with
[1:08:06] this
[1:08:07] you see right in the message community
[1:08:09] instead of having the experience of the
[1:08:12] fullness of the holy ghost
[1:08:14] too many have taken a secular
[1:08:16] denominational approach and like the
[1:08:19] baptist just say i believe the message
[1:08:22] amount of mental assent to agree unto a
[1:08:26] doctrine and deny the supernatural birth
[1:08:30] of the word and doing so reject christ
[1:08:34] and this is making a mockery of the true
[1:08:37] holy ghost
[1:08:38] when you take the holy ghost and just
[1:08:41] make it a mental uh a mental ascent or
[1:08:46] or a dried-eyed confession
[1:08:48] or just uh just an agreement that the
[1:08:51] word is true and you call that the holy
[1:08:54] ghost that is mocking the spirit of god
[1:08:59] it's making light of it
[1:09:03] now
[1:09:03] you see
[1:09:04] they're doing the same that mary did and
[1:09:07] mary you know of course confessed to the
[1:09:10] angel it came mary confessed that her
[1:09:13] child was born
[1:09:15] of um a supernatural birth she confessed
[1:09:18] all that but in the moment
[1:09:21] in a moment of weakness
[1:09:24] when she went looking for jesus who was
[1:09:26] there in the temple and standing before
[1:09:28] all those priests she denied the
[1:09:31] supernatural birth by saying your father
[1:09:35] and i
[1:09:38] have been looking for you and jesus the
[1:09:40] word corrected the era
[1:09:43] and he said don't you know i must be
[1:09:45] about my father's business jesus
[1:09:48] corrected my father isn't this man
[1:09:51] my father is god
[1:09:55] and i must be about his business
[1:09:58] amen so now again you see in that moment
[1:10:02] of weakness a good woman like mary
[1:10:04] because she hadn't received the holy
[1:10:06] ghost yet either but in that moment you
[1:10:08] know standing before those priests you
[1:10:10] know she didn't want to she didn't want
[1:10:12] to look like a you know an illegitimate
[1:10:14] birth or a fatherless son or you know or
[1:10:17] maybe in that moment she was a little
[1:10:19] bit awkward to say oh he was born in the
[1:10:22] supernatural so she said my father your
[1:10:24] father and i
[1:10:27] calling joseph
[1:10:29] his father
[1:10:31] and in that moment of weakness
[1:10:34] denied the supernatural birth
[1:10:37] and brother bradham said she denied the
[1:10:40] supernatural birth pentecost took
[1:10:42] speaking in tongues
[1:10:44] they denied the birth of the word
[1:10:48] you see that's exactly what they did it
[1:10:51] takes so much of it won't take the rest
[1:10:53] of it it denied the birth of the word
[1:10:55] just like mary did in other words they
[1:10:58] they accepted a man-made
[1:11:01] formula
[1:11:02] from a denomination rather than the word
[1:11:05] of god
[1:11:07] now
[1:11:08] like brother valdez said i quoted last
[1:11:11] week the azusa movement took a
[1:11:13] manufactured tongue of a make-up made-up
[1:11:16] language uh a doddy do
[1:11:18] you know a daddy daddy
[1:11:21] and denied the supernatural birth of the
[1:11:23] word
[1:11:25] manufactured
[1:11:27] and mocked
[1:11:30] made of mockery out of the true gift of
[1:11:32] god
[1:11:36] now again this is what sends them to the
[1:11:39] tribulation
[1:11:41] weeping and wailing and gnashing of
[1:11:43] teeth
[1:11:44] now again brother branham in 64 question
[1:11:47] answers that what's the pentecostal age
[1:11:49] after he come to there he made the
[1:11:51] promise of el shaddai nurse from me
[1:11:54] the question is can you nurse
[1:11:57] that was brought before the pentecostals
[1:11:59] can you nurse but they didn't do it they
[1:12:01] grabbed them a breast from the
[1:12:03] nomination where they came out of but
[1:12:05] the real seed come on to nurse that
[1:12:08] breast
[1:12:09] i'm telling you there's a real seed
[1:12:13] hallelujah a real seed
[1:12:16] that's going to come and nurse from the
[1:12:17] breast of el salvia
[1:12:19] get a real true holy ghost
[1:12:22] not just an anointing an infilling
[1:12:26] now what's what he offered the
[1:12:27] pentecostal and now what what's what he
[1:12:30] offers us by the holy ghost i want you
[1:12:32] to get this he offered it to this last
[1:12:36] age
[1:12:37] and the pentecostals were the first to
[1:12:39] start to embrace it
[1:12:43] now
[1:12:44] and so he offered it to them but rather
[1:12:47] than that they went to denomination
[1:12:50] and nursed their strength of i spoke in
[1:12:53] tongues
[1:12:56] i shouted i danced and i spoke in
[1:12:58] tongues
[1:12:59] they took outward emotions and a
[1:13:02] manufactured tongue and exalted that
[1:13:05] over the promise of god making a mockery
[1:13:08] of it
[1:13:09] hold my thought now
[1:13:10] you see and as brother branham said you
[1:13:13] know i am the breasted god i am this
[1:13:16] strong one lean on my bosom now nurture
[1:13:19] me my strength into your weak body
[1:13:21] getting him ready for the miracle he let
[1:13:24] pentecostals nurse his own strength his
[1:13:27] own holy spirit as a baptism back into
[1:13:31] their weak bodies to give them faith for
[1:13:34] the rapture to give them faith for
[1:13:37] miracles
[1:13:40] now i want you to see what the holy
[1:13:41] ghost
[1:13:42] does that was offered to the
[1:13:44] pentecostals that they took the breast
[1:13:46] to denomination for
[1:13:48] what's now what will it do it will it
[1:13:51] will nurse strength back into their weak
[1:13:54] bodies give them faith for a rapture
[1:13:58] and give them faith for miracles
[1:14:02] this is what the holy ghost will do
[1:14:06] it will give you rapture and faith
[1:14:11] hallelujah
[1:14:12] amen the rapture and faith is not a tape
[1:14:16] raptured faith is the holy ghost
[1:14:19] it's what gives you it's what gives you
[1:14:22] rapture and faith
[1:14:24] amen so he said now what he what he did
[1:14:27] to abraham and seed after him believe in
[1:14:29] confirmation blood covenant now
[1:14:31] injecting himself his strength into his
[1:14:35] people
[1:14:36] look here you say brother to him how can
[1:14:38] we live in our overcoming life in this
[1:14:40] evil age because you can nurse from him
[1:14:43] and his strength comes into you by the
[1:14:46] baptism of the holy ghost that gives you
[1:14:48] power over a life of sin
[1:14:52] now so that's how we can stand in this
[1:14:55] age think of it
[1:14:57] think of it to bring us to rapture
[1:14:59] all we got to do
[1:15:01] is drink from the holy ghost
[1:15:04] amen which is also christ the word in
[1:15:07] its fullness with baptism after baptism
[1:15:11] of it giving us faith for miracles
[1:15:14] and faith for rapture

[1:18:01] so it's a refreshing
[1:18:05] now remember it's a feast and in the
[1:18:07] feasts there's refreshment
[1:18:10] and this feeling of the holy ghost is
[1:18:13] not merely an anointing or a baptism in
[1:18:15] the gifts but it's now god injecting
[1:18:19] himself his own strength into his people
[1:18:23] how by them nursing his own holy spirit
[1:18:27] as a baptism to give them faith for the
[1:18:29] rapture and faith for miracles
[1:18:32] now let's look in the bible and see
[1:18:34] what's promised in this end age go to
[1:18:36] acts chapter 3 verse 19.
[1:18:39] and he tells us to repent
[1:18:41] you therefore and be converted that your
[1:18:43] sins might be blotted out sins are
[1:18:46] blotted out without conversion and
[1:18:48] repentance
[1:18:50] when the times of refreshing shall come
[1:18:54] from the presence of the lord god's
[1:18:55] going to be pouring out his spirit
[1:18:58] in this last days and it's at times of
[1:19:00] refreshing
[1:19:02] i'm going to give a feast
[1:19:05] i'm going to give a feast of a seven
[1:19:07] course menu
[1:19:09] i'm gonna open in the entire book
[1:19:12] amen because we're celebrating that
[1:19:15] there is now a supernatural people on
[1:19:18] earth
[1:19:24] now
[1:19:25] again isaac was not born of the will of
[1:19:28] man or the will of the flesh but he was
[1:19:30] born of god
[1:19:33] look now and verse 20 and he shall send
[1:19:36] jesus christ which before was preached
[1:19:39] unto you of whom the heaven must receive
[1:19:42] until the times of restitution of all
[1:19:45] things how many beliefs were in that
[1:19:47] time
[1:19:48] which god has spoken by the mouth of all
[1:19:50] his holy prophets since the world began
[1:19:53] in fact what we read today was being
[1:19:55] prophesied
[1:19:58] amen of the seed of abraham having a
[1:20:01] feast in this last day
[1:20:04] hallelujah celebrating that life is here
[1:20:09] celebrating that the joy is here that
[1:20:13] that here made us to laugh
[1:20:16] who would have thought after 2 000 years
[1:20:19] and all the trouble down to the ages
[1:20:21] that the oil church sarah would bring
[1:20:24] for the child
[1:20:28] who would plot
[1:20:30] there could be a rapture
[1:20:32] after all of this time
[1:20:35] when it's been given up on for years and
[1:20:37] years and years
[1:20:40] when people have lost faith
[1:20:45] but in this moment
[1:20:47] god has made us to laugh
[1:20:50] hallelujah we can look over and say
[1:20:52] denomination didn't do it isn't the man
[1:20:55] didn't do it almighty god did this this
[1:20:58] is not another child of the bones woman
[1:21:01] this is not another denomination rising
[1:21:03] up this is a supernatural child
[1:21:13] what's now coming back in his full
[1:21:15] strength
[1:21:16] what was the holy ghost given for but
[1:21:18] pentecost what is it it's a restoration
[1:21:20] of the same kind of grain that went into
[1:21:23] ground at the beginning bringing all the
[1:21:26] fullness of the power of pentecost
[1:21:29] by the baptism of the holy ghost in the
[1:21:32] last days
[1:21:33] you know what it is it's a people that
[1:21:35] the eagle anointing is on
[1:21:38] how many knows we're in the eagle age
[1:21:41] under an eagle anointing
[1:21:43] amen they that wait on the lord shall
[1:21:45] renew their strength
[1:21:48] so you see in the eagle age there comes
[1:21:50] a time of renewing of strength
[1:21:54] a time of repression a feast time
[1:21:59] a time of rejoicing
[1:22:01] god has made us to laugh
[1:22:06] amen
[1:22:07] turn with me to psalms 103 101 verse
[1:22:11] 103 verse 1
[1:22:13] bless the lord o my soul
[1:22:16] and all that is within me

[1:22:22] all his benefits
[1:22:24] who forgiveth all thine iniquities
[1:22:27] and who healeth all of thy diseases
[1:22:31] hallelujah that's the benefits
[1:22:34] of belonging to abraham's seed
[1:22:38] amen who crowneth thee with loving
[1:22:40] kindness and tender mercy who satisfieth
[1:22:44] thy mouth with good things we're having
[1:22:46] a feast
[1:22:49] in a time of great trouble
[1:22:51] he has hit us in his pavilion in his
[1:22:54] time of trouble he has led us into shady
[1:22:56] green pastures in the time of trouble
[1:23:00] are you with me church
[1:23:02] there's a refreshment a feast prepared
[1:23:08] i'll set a table before you in the
[1:23:10] presence of thine enemies
[1:23:14] when hell is all around you i'm going to
[1:23:17] be having a marriage feast
[1:23:21] a celebration
[1:23:23] hallelujah a celebration that life
[1:23:26] has now in the body
[1:23:29] which is the vindication the rapture is
[1:23:31] at hand
[1:23:33] all right
[1:23:35] so that thy youth
[1:23:36] is renewed
[1:23:38] like the eagles
[1:23:40] you see the bride's anointing is an
[1:23:42] eagle anointing
[1:23:44] and when the bride when it when when the
[1:23:47] old bird gets old
[1:23:49] and its beak gets crusty
[1:23:52] he can go back to the rock where he was
[1:23:54] born
[1:23:55] and beat against that rock
[1:23:58] and there he will molt and grow new
[1:24:00] feathers and there he'll knock the crust
[1:24:03] off of his beak
[1:24:05] i know that's true i mean my you know we
[1:24:08] we my dad always loved to have a bird in
[1:24:10] the house and see he always had a
[1:24:12] parakeet that could talk and he would
[1:24:14] train them to talk and and and he had
[1:24:16] one one of the parakeets got old and
[1:24:19] when he did there was a growth that came
[1:24:21] over his nose
[1:24:22] and that and it was closing off his air
[1:24:24] holes
[1:24:26] and and they so you know he he was
[1:24:29] getting more and more sick and my dad
[1:24:32] looked at him examined him recognized
[1:24:34] the problem and he took his old
[1:24:36] fingernail and got to working on that
[1:24:38] beak
[1:24:40] and he began to scrape off and pull the
[1:24:42] crust off of that old bird where he
[1:24:44] could breathe through his nose again
[1:24:47] well i'll tell you what unbelief in the
[1:24:49] world and doubt and fear and claims that
[1:24:52] days of miracles are past can make you
[1:24:55] so stuffy closing up your airways where
[1:24:58] you can't fly i tell you what it's time
[1:25:01] to go back to the rock
[1:25:04] hallelujah go back to pentecost go back
[1:25:06] to where we were born our birthplace
[1:25:11] and beat on that rock until the crust
[1:25:13] comes off
[1:25:14] and we believe that christ is the same
[1:25:16] again
[1:25:18] you see the coming of el shaddai to
[1:25:20] abraham and sarah
[1:25:22] was to bring about the renewing
[1:25:25] of their youth
[1:25:27] the infilling of the holy ghost is
[1:25:29] bringing about a renewing
[1:25:31] an old 2000 year old church who had long
[1:25:35] given up on the promised son
[1:25:37] is changing her back to the same
[1:25:41] new young bride
[1:25:43] that she was on the day of pentecost
[1:25:47] i want to hear i want you to get what
[1:25:49] i'm saying this drink that god is
[1:25:51] pouring out
[1:25:53] this holy ghost that he's given
[1:25:55] amen with this word that he has given
[1:25:58] comes the power of the word the holy
[1:26:00] ghost somebody help me preach
[1:26:02] and in doing so he is renewing the 2000
[1:26:06] year old church
[1:26:08] to be like she was on the day of
[1:26:11] pentecost when she was a young girl
[1:26:16] that's what he did to sarah
[1:26:17] [Applause]
[1:26:21] he changed her back to young again
[1:26:24] you see satan knows it surely now i'm
[1:26:26] going to read some things just real
[1:26:28] quickly from the the church age book
[1:26:30] just to remind you of who we are
[1:26:33] satan knows assuredly that the original
[1:26:36] church at pentecost with the power of
[1:26:38] god mark 16 an action is the true church
[1:26:43] that jesus claims as his own all else is
[1:26:46] false
[1:26:49] amen so there has to be a renewing
[1:26:52] of the church that being likes it was on
[1:26:55] the day of pentecost
[1:26:57] don't you know there is a resistance to
[1:26:59] the truth
[1:27:00] do you know what that is it's the
[1:27:01] working of devils
[1:27:03] because satan knows assuredly
[1:27:06] that the original church at pentecost
[1:27:08] with the power of god mark 16 and
[1:27:11] actually is the true church
[1:27:13] the one that jesus claims as his own
[1:27:16] all else is faults
[1:27:20] so it's a workings the devil
[1:27:23] through impersonations
[1:27:25] of real gifts like tongues
[1:27:27] until something so wonderful and
[1:27:29] precious is speaking in a heavenly
[1:27:32] language is despised and rejected
[1:27:35] it's a mockery of the truth as isaac was
[1:27:38] mocked
[1:27:40] the supernatural
[1:27:42] should be celebrated
[1:27:47] hallelujah that's why god called the
[1:27:49] beast
[1:27:50] it's celebrating the supernatural
[1:27:53] who would have thought
[1:27:55] this would ever happen
[1:27:57] but it's
[1:27:58] happening
[1:28:00] who would ever thought the young people
[1:28:02] could get a real baptism of the holy
[1:28:05] ghost in this evil age but it's
[1:28:07] happening anyhow
[1:28:10] who would have ever thought there would
[1:28:11] still be signs and wonders and miracles
[1:28:13] among the church but it's happening
[1:28:15] anyhow it's an hour of celebration
[1:28:18] [Applause]
[1:28:24] you see the old vine is putting forth
[1:28:26] another branch
[1:28:28] the old woman
[1:28:30] was becoming new again
[1:28:32] the old church is having a revival
[1:28:35] [Applause]
[1:28:37] and when the the old vine puts forth
[1:28:39] another branch its branch is just like
[1:28:42] it was in pentecost
[1:28:46] because he said but if the mind ever
[1:28:48] puts forth another branch of itself that
[1:28:50] branch will be exactly like the vine
[1:28:52] itself it'll be the same kind of a
[1:28:54] branch that was brought forth at
[1:28:56] pentecost it will speak in tongues
[1:28:58] prophesy and have the power and signs of
[1:29:02] the resurrected christ in it
[1:29:04] amen
[1:29:06] amen
[1:29:08] again
[1:29:09] taking this these these series of
[1:29:11] quotations just to remind you of this
[1:29:13] renewing what god is doing
[1:29:16] taking sarah back
[1:29:18] to the way she was
[1:29:20] when she was young
[1:29:23] except this time we're predestinated not
[1:29:25] to fall
[1:29:27] he fixed the problem with the womb
[1:29:33] by procrastinating this one
[1:29:36] not to fall
[1:29:39] he not just turn her back like that
[1:29:42] it's not a repeat of pentecost
[1:29:45] in the sense that we're going to repeat
[1:29:46] their fall and they're falling away
[1:29:50] this was not going in the ground it's
[1:29:52] going in the garner
[1:29:56] that's what the church was at pentecost
[1:29:59] is the standard
[1:30:01] that's the pattern there is no other
[1:30:03] pattern no matter what the scholar says
[1:30:06] the god has not changed that pattern
[1:30:09] what god did at pentecost he has to keep
[1:30:12] on doing until the church ages close
[1:30:20] many believes we're to be the true
[1:30:21] church
[1:30:22] then the true church will always try to
[1:30:25] be like the original pentecost
[1:30:27] the true church of today will try to
[1:30:29] approximate that early first day
[1:30:33] in the ephesian church age he said it
[1:30:35] this way the promise of power which with
[1:30:38] which with which the apostles were
[1:30:41] endued
[1:30:42] at pentecost is to you jews and your
[1:30:44] children jews and then them that are far
[1:30:47] off gentiles
[1:30:48] and to as many as the lord our god shall
[1:30:50] call both jew and gentiles until he
[1:30:53] stops calling the pentecostal message
[1:30:56] and power will not cease
[1:30:59] what the church had at pentecost is her
[1:31:02] inalienable right
[1:31:04] originally she had the pure word of god
[1:31:06] she had the power the spirit manifested
[1:31:09] in diverse signs and wonders and gifts
[1:31:11] of the holy sick ghost
[1:31:14] that was her in her original condition
[1:31:17] as jesus went away he told his disciples
[1:31:20] to terry and uh until pentecost at which
[1:31:23] time the very same spirit that was upon
[1:31:26] him
[1:31:27] would come back and fall upon them and
[1:31:29] fill them
[1:31:30] then that called out body the church
[1:31:33] would be in his dead upon the earth
[1:31:35] taking his place
[1:31:37] and because that same spirit
[1:31:40] that was in him would be in them that
[1:31:42] would do the same very same works
[1:31:45] and any people
[1:31:47] that is truly the body of jesus christ
[1:31:50] the true church will manifest the same
[1:31:53] works as jesus did and the pentecostal
[1:31:56] church because that because the same
[1:31:59] spirit will be in them and any other
[1:32:02] church that does not have the spirit and
[1:32:05] the manifestations is going to have to
[1:32:07] give account to god
[1:32:10] and if the church is the true church it
[1:32:13] will have the very same spirit and word
[1:32:16] and acts of power that they had at
[1:32:18] pentecost
[1:32:19] by experience it will be a pentecostal
[1:32:22] church and there will be tongues and
[1:32:25] interpretation and prophecies and
[1:32:28] healings and god will be in the midst of
[1:32:30] her and god will declare himself in the
[1:32:33] midst of her as he always has
[1:32:39] hallelujah
[1:32:40] amen no matter what's going on in the
[1:32:43] age we can thank god that in the last
[1:32:45] age
[1:32:46] there will be a true a group rise up the
[1:32:49] true bride of the last day and she will
[1:32:52] listen to the spirit in that day of
[1:32:55] gross darkness the light will return by
[1:32:58] the pure word and we will return to the
[1:33:01] power of pentecost to welcome back the
[1:33:04] lord jesus christ
[1:33:06] amen now of course he said the church is
[1:33:10] is no longer the mouthpiece of god
[1:33:13] and think about it was his smell the
[1:33:14] mouthpiece of god
[1:33:17] was it was hagar the mouthpiece of god
[1:33:20] no god's mouth was speaking
[1:33:23] the prophecy was ongoing
[1:33:25] the celebration had begun
[1:33:28] the rejoicing was going on
[1:33:32] but the church has its own mouthpiece
[1:33:34] and so god is turning on her
[1:33:37] he will confound her through the prophet
[1:33:39] and the bride for the voice of god will
[1:33:41] be in her
[1:33:43] amen
[1:33:45] yes it says in the last chapter
[1:33:47] revelation verse 17 the spirit and the
[1:33:49] bride said come once more the world will
[1:33:52] hear direct from god as at pentecost but
[1:33:55] of course the word bride will be
[1:33:57] repudiated
[1:33:59] mocked rejected
[1:34:01] cast away
[1:34:02] as in the first stage
[1:34:05] cast away by who
[1:34:06] the bondswoman
[1:34:11] not by god
[1:34:14] the bomb's woman for her behavior
[1:34:17] her and ismail
[1:34:19] gets sin into tribulation
[1:34:23] but god will vindicate this bride
[1:34:26] by the miraculous
[1:34:31] amen by the miraculous chains of the
[1:34:33] body
[1:34:34] by the median in the air
[1:34:37] by his signs and wonders among us now
[1:34:41] hallelujah
[1:34:42] but it's also a fact that the prophet
[1:34:44] for the last days must be bringing forth
[1:34:46] a message from god that will forerun the
[1:34:48] second coming of christ for by his
[1:34:50] message will the hearts of the children
[1:34:53] be turned back to the pentecostal
[1:34:55] fathers and with the restoration of the
[1:34:57] word will come the restoration of the
[1:35:00] power
[1:35:02] hallelujah so it looks like we got the
[1:35:04] true word we're going to have the true
[1:35:06] power
[1:35:07] amen as it was to be in the age at this
[1:35:10] last age was to be when which the true
[1:35:12] church would return to be in the bride
[1:35:15] she was at pentecost we know there must
[1:35:18] have necessity be a return a dynamic
[1:35:21] power
[1:35:23] amen
[1:35:24] what about the true seed it will happen
[1:35:26] just as we said the people of god are
[1:35:29] being made ready by the word of truth
[1:35:31] from the messenger to this age in her
[1:35:34] will be the fullness of pentecost for
[1:35:36] the spirit will bring the people right
[1:35:39] back to where they were at the beginning
[1:35:42] that's that saith the lord
[1:35:47] and tell me where he ever failed
[1:35:51] god will take the church right back to
[1:35:53] pentecost to the beginning
[1:35:57] this is what he's doing to sarah
[1:35:59] this is how she's going to bring forth
[1:36:01] the supernatural this is why she's
[1:36:02] bringing forth the super night
[1:36:05] now in the uncertain sound we're leaving
[1:36:08] the church in his book and i've just got
[1:36:09] a couple i want to read to you as we're
[1:36:11] talking about this church and her
[1:36:13] renewing
[1:36:14] was
[1:36:15] the pentecostal church a noisy church
[1:36:19] back at the beginning when the holy
[1:36:21] ghost first fell
[1:36:25] the virgin mary like she was drunk
[1:36:28] straggling under the power of god and
[1:36:30] all of them like that
[1:36:32] and the people said
[1:36:34] they're full of new wine
[1:36:36] mocking
[1:36:38] that's the way the church was ordained
[1:36:41] that's the way that the church every
[1:36:43] church was ordained every time god has a
[1:36:46] church it'll be that same kind of church
[1:36:49] because it ain't got no uncertain sound
[1:36:51] well well i'd be successful i don't care
[1:36:53] what the bishop says it's what the word
[1:36:56] says the bishop's got an uncertain sound
[1:36:59] if his sound is sounding something
[1:37:02] if his sound is sounding the same thing
[1:37:04] this is he's right and then if the
[1:37:07] church don't act like it did like that
[1:37:10] he's wrong and if you say you got it and
[1:37:13] didn't act like that there's something
[1:37:15] wrong with you
[1:37:22] now
[1:37:24] you know
[1:37:25] to be a part of this sinful age
[1:37:28] and its unbelief
[1:37:29] you don't have to be smoking
[1:37:31] drinking lying
[1:37:33] fornicating stealing committing adultery
[1:37:37] just simply believe
[1:37:39] he's not the same
[1:37:46] does it get you centered
[1:37:50] to tribulation
[1:37:52] jesus christ again question answered
[1:37:54] brother brandon said jesus christ the
[1:37:56] same yesterday today and forever now
[1:37:58] we're taught that i don't care what
[1:37:59] you're taught the bible said he said let
[1:38:02] every man's word be a lie and mind's the
[1:38:05] truth he said well he's principally the
[1:38:07] same but i don't you mean he's the same
[1:38:09] yeah in the church he's doing the same
[1:38:11] thing that he did when he was here oh i
[1:38:14] can't believe that you're sinning
[1:38:17] you're sinning and he that's born of god
[1:38:19] or the holy ghost don't say those things
[1:38:22] and if he's got the holy ghost and says
[1:38:25] those things that's the evidence he
[1:38:27] hasn't got it
[1:38:29] i don't care what he's done if he don't
[1:38:31] believe in divine healing he don't
[1:38:33] believe in the power of the resurrection
[1:38:35] he don't believe in the holy ghost being
[1:38:37] poured out upon us just exactly like he
[1:38:40] did in the first age just the same god
[1:38:43] yesterday today and forever the same
[1:38:45] thing the apostles done happening right
[1:38:48] now speaking in tongues and rejoicing
[1:38:50] and all of these other things if they
[1:38:52] don't believe that he's not born of god
[1:38:56] for whosoever is born of god did not
[1:38:57] commit those kind of things that's how
[1:39:00] to tell whether they're born of god
[1:39:07] now
[1:39:08] let's be clear
[1:39:10] this upper room experience
[1:39:12] is not a return to azusa street
[1:39:15] azusa street did not have the upper room
[1:39:18] experience
[1:39:20] before they got it
[1:39:23] they took
[1:39:24] speaking in tongues first a gift
[1:39:29] but you see it is a return
[1:39:32] by malachi 4 to the faith of the fathers
[1:39:38] amen the literal life of christ notice
[1:39:41] not not a gift not an anointing the very
[1:39:45] person of christ
[1:39:49] abraham would see that for him he said
[1:39:51] what's what he'd done to abraham see
[1:39:54] what he'd done to abraham justification
[1:39:56] justification is churches see
[1:39:58] sanctification through wesley that great
[1:40:00] messenger sanctification to pentecost
[1:40:03] through there pentecost through here
[1:40:05] pentecost nursing brilliant how many
[1:40:07] understands that when he was el shaddai
[1:40:09] he gave his own strength into abraham he
[1:40:13] never didn't done nothing but made him
[1:40:15] promise his promises up to them
[1:40:18] but but now here he's emptying himself
[1:40:21] into abraham literally
[1:40:26] how many knows that that was the holy
[1:40:28] ghost justification what you believe
[1:40:30] saying to be gay so what the blood
[1:40:31] doesn't for you you're sanctified by
[1:40:33] believing but when you're filled with
[1:40:35] the holy ghost it is the person
[1:40:38] of the holy ghost himself
[1:40:42] oh the person not an imagination not
[1:40:45] some kind of psychology but the person
[1:40:48] of the holy ghost and you my christian
[1:40:50] science brother and you that that don't
[1:40:53] believe the holy ghost as a person he is
[1:40:55] a personal pronoun
[1:40:57] the bible said when he the holy ghost
[1:40:59] has come he will testify me he is a
[1:41:02] person not a thought
[1:41:05] he nursed from not from the articles and
[1:41:08] from the promises but now he had the
[1:41:10] literal life of god flowing into him and
[1:41:14] that's what the pentecostal age done and
[1:41:17] what he become a son
[1:41:21] now brother branham tells us in the
[1:41:23] token
[1:41:24] of the wrath that is coming on the earth
[1:41:26] and we are in a time of wrath
[1:41:28] the evening shadows are appearing the
[1:41:31] wrath is being poured out from on high
[1:41:33] that's what you're seeing already
[1:41:34] pre-tribulation plagues insanity coming
[1:41:37] up on the earth
[1:41:39] amen it's coming upon professors without
[1:41:41] a possession
[1:41:43] it's poured out on ungodly nations
[1:41:46] it's not just america it's all over
[1:41:49] upon ungodly believers
[1:41:51] and brother branham said that
[1:41:53] he said now we're living in the shadows
[1:41:56] and the wrath is ready to strike and god
[1:41:59] is requiring a token a sign that you
[1:42:02] yourself have received his token the
[1:42:05] holy ghost it is the only way and the
[1:42:08] only sign that god will ever pass
[1:42:10] because it is the literal life of jesus
[1:42:14] christ return back to the believer
[1:42:18] so notice what the token is the literal
[1:42:20] life
[1:42:22] not a jump not a dance
[1:42:25] not a gift not a tongue
[1:42:28] not a prophecy
[1:42:31] but the person
[1:42:33] christ coming to live in you
[1:42:37] now
[1:42:38] the pentecostal charismatic full gospel
[1:42:41] oh they gladly embraced the gifts
[1:42:44] but they rejected the giver
[1:42:47] and then made a mockery of the holy
[1:42:49] ghost
[1:42:50] because he still lived in the sin
[1:42:53] cutting hair wearing makeup staying in
[1:42:56] their old formal churches of
[1:42:58] episcopalian and
[1:43:00] and whatever else and speaking in
[1:43:02] tongues
[1:43:04] what was that making a mockery of the
[1:43:06] holy ghost
[1:43:09] but i want you to say
[1:43:10] you know we we can't just keep pointing
[1:43:12] out there there there there
[1:43:14] we got to realize friend we got to avoid
[1:43:17] the same problem in this movement
[1:43:20] generally speaking many are guilty of
[1:43:22] saying we've accepted him
[1:43:24] while rejecting his gifts
[1:43:29] i wonder sometimes if the pendulum
[1:43:32] hadn't swung all the way back the other
[1:43:34] way
[1:43:36] if so when you do then you're fulfilling
[1:43:39] revelation 3
[1:43:41] refusing christ
[1:43:44] mocking and refusing the full gospel and
[1:43:47] putting christ on the outside of his own
[1:43:49] church
[1:43:52] we don't want him in here
[1:43:53] we don't want his gifts in here
[1:43:55] we don't want his tongues we don't want
[1:43:57] interpretation we don't want prophecy
[1:44:00] we don't want the holy ghost moving
[1:44:02] we don't want prayer lines we don't want
[1:44:04] altar calls goodness me we don't want
[1:44:07] nobody snotting around our altars
[1:44:11] i ain't talking about out there i'm
[1:44:13] talking about writing message circles
[1:44:16] amen now brother adam said in the
[1:44:18] message oneness he said now the church
[1:44:20] is engaged to christ for the wedding the
[1:44:23] wedding has never been performed yet it
[1:44:25] will be at the wedding supper of the
[1:44:26] lamb so we see that the church is now
[1:44:29] engaged like a man engaged his wife what
[1:44:32] does he do while we're while they're
[1:44:34] engaged he's just bestowing all kinds of
[1:44:37] things sending her presents making her
[1:44:40] feel good
[1:44:41] well that's what christ is doing in his
[1:44:43] church he's sending us gifts of the
[1:44:45] spirit how can you be engaged then when
[1:44:48] you're denying these gifts exist
[1:44:52] it's the very love tokens it's god's
[1:44:55] token to the church jesus said so these
[1:44:57] signs have followed them that believe
[1:45:00] now keep those things in mind the church
[1:45:02] must believe every word somebody say
[1:45:04] everywhere
[1:45:05] every promise every iota and claim it
[1:45:08] for themselves and
[1:45:11] exercise themselves in it
[1:45:15] if i was engaged to a girl i was a
[1:45:17] single man i'd send her something an
[1:45:19] engagement ring and she wouldn't wear it
[1:45:22] that shows she doesn't believe me
[1:45:24] she doesn't want to be my bride and if
[1:45:27] christ sends his church the gifts that
[1:45:30] he's promised and they refuse them and
[1:45:33] say they're not so they
[1:45:36] don't want to be the bride of christ
[1:45:39] they are espoused to some other lover
[1:45:42] not to christ the bridegroom so the real
[1:45:45] church
[1:45:47] keeps the promise
[1:45:49] keeps them all
[1:45:51] and accepts the gifts that god sends
[1:45:53] them
[1:45:57] amen
[1:45:59] now
[1:45:59] you know
[1:46:01] you know come on
[1:46:03] we're having a feast
[1:46:05] and in the feast there's joy
[1:46:07] there's excitement
[1:46:09] there's passion
[1:46:11] there's good things at the table
[1:46:13] there's a lot of wine of stimulation to
[1:46:15] get drunk on
[1:46:17] we're celebrating the supernatural
[1:46:22] that god's working among his people
[1:46:25] hallelujah we're testifying that he
[1:46:28] heals the sick
[1:46:29] that not even cancers stand before our
[1:46:31] prayers that he heals blind brain bleeds
[1:46:34] that he makes the blind to see
[1:46:37] amen that he gives hearing to the death
[1:46:40] amen i know his power i've seen his
[1:46:43] power on this play
[1:46:47] are you with me
[1:46:48] amen but don't be embarrassed to show
[1:46:52] your joy
[1:46:53] and your passion and your love
[1:47:02] you see ishmael
[1:47:04] identified himself as a bonds woman's
[1:47:06] son
[1:47:09] by his reaction
[1:47:11] to the feast
[1:47:15] and on the feast table
[1:47:18] there's all kinds of good things
[1:47:20] oh brother tim there's mystery yeah
[1:47:21] there's mystery dishes
[1:47:24] seven seal when you open it when it's
[1:47:26] open it breaks the silence on all the
[1:47:28] rest of them
[1:47:30] hey man there's great meat and deep deep
[1:47:33] mysteries and great
[1:47:34] truths and wonderful grapes and fruits
[1:47:38] of the spirit
[1:47:39] and on that table all you have to do if
[1:47:41] you need healing is have somebody to
[1:47:43] pass you a dish of healing
[1:47:46] if you need salvation just ask for it
[1:47:49] pass it my way i i need a good dose of
[1:47:51] the holy ghost today
[1:47:53] amen if you're down in your spirit and
[1:47:55] you're all depressed amen pass me some
[1:47:58] of that joy unspeakable and full of
[1:48:00] glory it's all on the table
[1:48:05] hallelujah it's a cool banquet
[1:48:09] oh brother jim you're just trying to
[1:48:11] advocate some pentecostal gift no i'm
[1:48:13] not i'm saying every promise is ours
[1:48:16] everything is on the table it's all ours
[1:48:24] don't be ashamed of it
[1:48:26] you see ishmael should have been
[1:48:27] celebrating
[1:48:32] hagar should have been celebrated
[1:48:35] and i wonder sometimes how many get
[1:48:37] embarrassed
[1:48:38] when they're shouting
[1:48:40] dancing in the spirit
[1:48:42] speaking in other tongues
[1:48:46] your ishmael
[1:48:48] the son of a bund's woman mocking
[1:48:52] you see it's not dignified enough
[1:48:55] you know they're immature children
[1:48:57] they're just babies shouting and dancing
[1:49:00] and rejoicing as it did on the day of
[1:49:02] pentecost
[1:49:04] be careful
[1:49:05] when ishmael mocked isaac god cast him
[1:49:08] out
[1:49:11] here it was all right for him to remain
[1:49:14] with the rest of the believers
[1:49:18] come on
[1:49:19] until he marched
[1:49:22] and when he mocked there came a
[1:49:24] separation
[1:49:26] god did it
[1:49:31] listen when michael when or michelle um
[1:49:35] mocked david for dancing before the lord
[1:49:38] she became a cast off
[1:49:40] unworthy to bear the seed of the king
[1:49:44] oh
[1:49:45] you've heard it claimed
[1:49:50] you've heard it claimed
[1:49:51] we have the holy ghost without sensation
[1:49:53] today without feeling or emotion oh no
[1:49:56] you don't
[1:49:58] you have emotion
[1:50:01] jealousy is an emotion
[1:50:05] pride is a feeling an emotion
[1:50:08] a sensation
[1:50:10] and whatever you got is causing a lot of
[1:50:12] pride and arrogance
[1:50:14] scorn and contempt for shouting and
[1:50:17] dancing to the spirit is a feeling it's
[1:50:19] a sensation
[1:50:21] but the spirit that does that really
[1:50:23] isn't the holy spirit it's a spirit of
[1:50:26] blasphemy
[1:50:30] now but as ismail who laughed at the
[1:50:33] offspring of the supernatural so will
[1:50:36] the children out the bonds woman
[1:50:40] and they will be cast out into outer
[1:50:43] darkness
[1:50:46] where there is wailing and national
[1:50:48] teeth now now look when god sent them
[1:50:50] out he didn't just forsake him he they
[1:50:53] they come through the tribulation and
[1:50:55] they made a great nation out of them
[1:50:59] but they wasn't a part
[1:51:01] of the church anymore
[1:51:03] that was getting a body change and a
[1:51:06] promised son
[1:51:12] now brother branham talks about this
[1:51:14] embarrassment this scorn
[1:51:17] this
[1:51:18] mocking
[1:51:19] and the message ashamed of him as one of
[1:51:21] his last sermons he told us about being
[1:51:24] ashamed
[1:51:25] he said now when the calling out time
[1:51:27] comes
[1:51:29] that you don't belong to any of it it's
[1:51:31] very popular to say i'm pentecostal it's
[1:51:33] popular to say i'm presbyterian i'm i'm
[1:51:35] a lutheran but when it comes to the time
[1:51:38] where you have to come out and stand for
[1:51:39] the word i don't belong to any of it
[1:51:42] that embarrass jesus said if you're
[1:51:44] saying to me then i'll be ashamed of you
[1:51:47] why would he be ashamed to you because
[1:51:50] you're claiming to be his and you won't
[1:51:52] follow him
[1:51:53] what if i said this little boy
[1:51:55] he's my son
[1:51:57] and he'd turn around and say who me
[1:52:00] your son what do you think i am it would
[1:52:02] embarrass me
[1:52:03] it was you with your son
[1:52:06] and that's a way that so-called
[1:52:08] christianity today if you name the name
[1:52:10] of denomination all right they'll accept
[1:52:12] the fatherhood of denomination but when
[1:52:15] it comes to accepting the fatherhood of
[1:52:17] the word of god no
[1:52:19] they're
[1:52:20] embarrassed
[1:52:22] they don't want to say yes i've spoke
[1:52:24] with tongues i'm still reading
[1:52:27] yes i've seen vision 1965 jeffersonville
[1:52:31] amen yes i believe in divine healing yes
[1:52:35] i praise the lord
[1:52:37] i'm free from our organization i'm not
[1:52:40] bowing down to any of that i'm a servant
[1:52:42] of christ oh that just tears them to
[1:52:44] pieces
[1:52:45] to have to do that see
[1:52:47] the fatherhood of the word notice
[1:52:50] accepting the fatherhood of the word to
[1:52:52] be able to say what
[1:52:55] yes i've spoke with tongues
[1:52:57] yes i've seen visions
[1:53:00] yes i believe in divine healing yes i
[1:53:03] praise the lord
[1:53:07] amen now again
[1:53:10] again the fatherhood of the word what
[1:53:12] kind of children does the word father
[1:53:15] brother branham told his invisible union
[1:53:17] he said there's a union going on and
[1:53:20] there is a woman there in the secret of
[1:53:22] the jet and she has become pregnated
[1:53:27] and she's got life in her
[1:53:29] now watch and see what they are bringing
[1:53:32] forth
[1:53:34] notice what kind of children she is burn
[1:53:36] that tells what that what their papa is
[1:53:38] whether it's the ad of the first adam or
[1:53:40] the second adam if the church brings
[1:53:42] forth the child of the second adam he
[1:53:45] acts the second adam's way of acting
[1:53:47] like they did on the day of pentecost
[1:53:50] that's really the truth second adam's
[1:53:52] children see their nature is like his
[1:53:55] and hers
[1:53:57] now the whole thought of invisible union
[1:53:59] was a bright elect
[1:54:01] church whose womb was reserved for the
[1:54:04] word of god to bring forth his children
[1:54:08] to bring forth his supernatural life
[1:54:11] so he sends a true picture of the modern
[1:54:13] church today neither does the modern
[1:54:15] church want any of these see here it's
[1:54:17] the eastman likes they don't want any of
[1:54:19] these screaming shouting tongues
[1:54:20] speaking acts 238 youngins around her
[1:54:23] yeah she don't want them whooping and
[1:54:25] crying and screaming hey man hallelujah
[1:54:27] why such a child would immediately put
[1:54:29] her out of her denomination they had one
[1:54:31] like that in one of the churches they
[1:54:33] tore out right quick why are you letting
[1:54:35] such stuff as that go on so you see
[1:54:38] she's pregnant with something because
[1:54:40] she's bringing forth members all the
[1:54:42] time but she don't want none of them
[1:54:44] screaming hollering blabbering acts 2 38
[1:54:47] miserable creatures she thinks they are
[1:54:49] it would certainly embarrass her it
[1:54:51] would ruin her and her educated ethical
[1:54:54] scientific society church that she
[1:54:56] belonged to here they would throw her
[1:54:58] out at the next council she can't have
[1:55:00] it so she don't want to be pregnated
[1:55:03] with the word because that's the only
[1:55:06] kind
[1:55:07] the word can bring thought
[1:55:12] hallelujah born of the spirit of god it
[1:55:14] has a spirit of god in it
[1:55:17] it's no intellectual church joining
[1:55:21] just coming up and say i believe the
[1:55:23] message
[1:55:24] or creed going
[1:55:26] bob there trimming it off
[1:55:28] painted face and more makeups come and
[1:55:31] bold
[1:55:31] come on no such a thing as that at all
[1:55:34] you don't find that in the word of god
[1:55:37] you find an old-fashioned
[1:55:39] sanctified holy ghost-filled child born
[1:55:43] of the spirit of god screaming hollering
[1:55:46] shouting praising god
[1:55:51] amen said the word is preached and the
[1:55:53] word will give children birth to them
[1:55:55] kind of children
[1:55:56] but this embarrasses
[1:55:59] the israelites
[1:56:00] and the bondswoman
[1:56:03] you see
[1:56:05] as he said and ashamed
[1:56:07] where they're embarrassed
[1:56:09] scorned scuffing
[1:56:12] all of this coming because they're
[1:56:13] ashamed of the spirit of god
[1:56:16] he says and how come i can overcome he
[1:56:18] said you know the holiness groups like
[1:56:20] nazarenes he's referring to nazarenes
[1:56:22] and
[1:56:23] a pilgrim holiness these holiness groups
[1:56:26] they don't want to
[1:56:28] they don't want to to say holy ghost
[1:56:30] anymore because so they say holy spirit
[1:56:35] because to say holy ghost would identify
[1:56:37] them with those tongue-speaking people
[1:56:40] which is the very life
[1:56:44] and then he goes on and tells how
[1:56:47] because of rejection of the holy ghost
[1:56:50] what happened to them that they uh that
[1:56:53] when the unclean spirit came out through
[1:56:55] sanctification and they walked in dry
[1:56:58] places then come other devils had come
[1:57:00] and lived in them and the last state of
[1:57:03] the church was worse than the first
[1:57:09] a man who's once been in contact with
[1:57:11] god which is the word the word has been
[1:57:13] made plain and manifested to him there
[1:57:15] is no shameness about that
[1:57:18] amen you're not embarrassed
[1:57:21] it don't embarrass me to say i believe
[1:57:23] every word of god
[1:57:25] it don't embarrass me when the lord says
[1:57:27] to say something and you go and say it
[1:57:29] do it it doesn't embarrass me to say
[1:57:31] i've been filled with the holy ghost
[1:57:34] it don't embarrass me to say i've spoke
[1:57:36] with other tongues it don't embarrass me
[1:57:38] to say our lord has shown me visions it
[1:57:41] don't embarrass me to say he's the same
[1:57:43] yesterday today and forever
[1:57:47] amen you see that's the real children
[1:57:51] but like ishmael mocked abraham's
[1:57:54] supernatural son
[1:57:56] if you mock and make light of the
[1:57:58] supernatural
[1:58:00] a supernatural birth supernatural gifts
[1:58:03] supernatural healings god will cast you
[1:58:07] right out of his redeemed church
[1:58:10] into the tribulation where there is
[1:58:12] weeping and wailing and gnashing of
[1:58:14] teeth
[1:58:15] turn with me to galatians chapter 4 and
[1:58:17] verse 29
[1:58:19] but then he that was born out to the
[1:58:21] flesh
[1:58:23] persecuted him that was born after the
[1:58:26] spirit even so is it now
[1:58:29] notice now he said there's a persecution
[1:58:32] happens
[1:58:34] notice never nevertheless what say this
[1:58:36] says the scripture cast out the bonds
[1:58:39] woman and her son for the son of the
[1:58:41] bondsman shall not be heir with the son
[1:58:44] of the free woman so then brethren
[1:58:46] and here's my declaration
[1:58:48] we are not children of the bonds woman
[1:58:52] but children of the free
[1:58:55] how many identifies with that today
[1:58:58] amen we're not children of denomination
[1:59:00] we're not children of the balanced woman
[1:59:03] we're children of the free woman
[1:59:05] [Applause]
[1:59:09] what happened to israel
[1:59:11] they were born
[1:59:13] of the flesh of abraham the promise was
[1:59:15] originally given to them
[1:59:17] but on the day of pentecost
[1:59:19] they mocked and scoffed and ridiculed
[1:59:22] that 120 that came out of the upper room
[1:59:24] saying that they were drunk with new
[1:59:26] wine
[1:59:28] you see
[1:59:31] you you see that that's what happened
[1:59:33] let me tell you something friends it
[1:59:35] changed them people
[1:59:37] what came out of the upper room the word
[1:59:39] did not make them the word that was
[1:59:41] given did not make them intellectual
[1:59:44] eggheads
[1:59:46] a bunch of nerds
[1:59:48] with studious glasses
[1:59:50] it made them drunk
[1:59:53] changed
[1:59:54] it changed themselves until it even
[1:59:57] changed their language into a heavenly
[1:59:59] language
[2:00:02] but what happened to israel for
[2:00:04] rejecting the holy ghost like ishmael
[2:00:06] and hagar they were cast out
[2:00:12] so it is at this station
[2:00:14] of time where we're offered el said i
[2:00:16] the holy ghost the word in full power
[2:00:20] we cannot reject the word
[2:00:23] and then the word is everything
[2:00:27] amen to reject one part of it is reject
[2:00:30] it all remember all eve had to do was
[2:00:32] disbelieve one word
[2:00:34] and the word she disbelieved was he's
[2:00:36] the same yesterday today and forever
[2:00:39] and if you don't believe he's the same
[2:00:41] today
[2:00:42] that he was them
[2:00:45] come on
[2:00:46] amen if you don't believe that what is
[2:00:48] it you're ishmael's children
[2:00:51] what's now what's this we cannot reject
[2:00:53] the word and the word is everything it
[2:00:55] is the open book
[2:00:57] and prophecy is in the book
[2:00:59] tongues is in the book healings in the
[2:01:02] book miracles in the book righteous holy
[2:01:05] living is in the book amen you cannot
[2:01:07] have the holy ghost and reject any part
[2:01:09] of the word
[2:01:10] [Music]
[2:01:12] but they didn't want it so they grabbed
[2:01:14] the breath to denomination
[2:01:16] instead and took speaking in tongues as
[2:01:18] their evidence
[2:01:20] now
[2:01:21] a lot of the message
[2:01:23] folks don't want to nurse from the holy
[2:01:25] ghost either
[2:01:28] they're afraid
[2:01:30] of being called
[2:01:31] pentecostal
[2:01:35] they make fun of little isaac
[2:01:39] those tongue talking acts 238 youngans
[2:01:43] so they adopt a secular approach
[2:01:47] like the other denomination
[2:01:50] that bombs women do
[2:01:52] of lutheran and baptists claiming the
[2:01:54] new birth without an experience
[2:01:57] without and with no emotion it's just
[2:01:59] something that happens upon the
[2:02:01] acknowledgment of a believer profession
[2:02:04] of faith in the message and they too
[2:02:06] have taken the breath of denomination
[2:02:09] and nurse on a creed
[2:02:13] instead of our shady eye the power of
[2:02:16] the holy ghost
[2:02:18] and they lean on psychology
[2:02:22] to change their character
[2:02:24] their behavior
[2:02:26] their temperament
[2:02:27] you see since they reject or know
[2:02:29] nothing of the power of the holy spirit
[2:02:31] they have to borrow ideas from other
[2:02:34] denominations
[2:02:44] this is what was happening in the
[2:02:46] pentecostal movement in brother
[2:02:47] branham's time
[2:02:49] this is something he struck out against
[2:02:51] the assembly of god
[2:02:54] the pentecostals were requiring their
[2:02:56] ministers pass a test by given by a
[2:02:59] psychiatrist
[2:03:02] think about it pentecostals who who were
[2:03:05] supposed to believe in the supernatural
[2:03:08] have become so backslidden
[2:03:11] so
[2:03:13] yes powerless
[2:03:14] instead of giving a word examination
[2:03:18] to see if they had the faith once
[2:03:20] delivered to the saints
[2:03:22] they were given them a test given by a
[2:03:25] psychiatrist
[2:03:27] psychiatrists psychiatrists the branch
[2:03:30] of medicine is focused on diagnosing and
[2:03:33] treating mental health disorders
[2:03:36] and the term literally means a medical
[2:03:38] treatment of the soul
[2:03:42] so you see they were trying to by man's
[2:03:46] effort treat the soul
[2:03:52] now hold on to my thought for a minute
[2:03:54] this is going to get in pretty deep
[2:03:56] water
[2:03:57] you see
[2:03:59] like psychologists
[2:04:00] psychiatrists use psychotherapy to help
[2:04:03] their clients
[2:04:05] so you know again this is the trend the
[2:04:08] trend the denomination i want you to
[2:04:10] watch the bonds woman
[2:04:12] you know to fix the problems in the
[2:04:15] church
[2:04:16] of unfaithfulness in marriage
[2:04:18] immorality
[2:04:20] teen pregnancies
[2:04:23] rebellion
[2:04:26] they brought in psychology
[2:04:33] because
[2:04:34] they had lost the power of the holy
[2:04:37] ghost
[2:04:39] in other words they were a bankrupt
[2:04:41] church
[2:04:43] flied in the spirit of god
[2:04:46] and it come to rely on man's efforts
[2:04:51] because ishmael came by man's efforts
[2:04:58] oh my thought i got a little ways to go
[2:05:00] on this
[2:05:01] amen the idea to qualify a ministry
[2:05:05] think of this the pentecostals did this
[2:05:08] by a psychiatrist it come from a
[2:05:10] devilish
[2:05:11] and poisonous winds blown by satan who
[2:05:14] had killed the revival in the church
[2:05:17] and those poisoned whims of satan
[2:05:21] teaches a person not to believe in the
[2:05:23] supernatural and that the operation of
[2:05:25] the power of god is fanaticism
[2:05:28] and so we have to lean on man's devices
[2:05:32] to change and reform man
[2:05:37] now notice this i want you to get what
[2:05:40] we have today we are not trying to
[2:05:42] reform you young people
[2:05:44] are you old
[2:05:47] amen we are wanting a transformation
[2:05:52] by the renewing of your mind
[2:05:54] which comes by the holy ghost not
[2:05:58] by teaching you a new way of thinking
[2:06:03] amen
[2:06:05] you see
[2:06:07] so again it was spiritual death at work
[2:06:10] that was in the pentecostal church and i
[2:06:12] want you to understand that spiritual
[2:06:14] death keeps rolling right on up because
[2:06:16] the last plague to strike the church is
[2:06:19] spiritual death
[2:06:21] and that's what they were requiring was
[2:06:23] a mental test performed by psychologists
[2:06:25] to see if his high iq was high enough to
[2:06:28] pass the test
[2:06:30] but god is our test
[2:06:32] amen did this scripture is our test this
[2:06:35] is the test these signs shall follow
[2:06:37] them that believe
[2:06:40] that's a test of the true ministry
[2:06:43] you see faith in god a mind that could
[2:06:46] believe god's word that's the iq that
[2:06:48] was required on the day of pentecost the
[2:06:50] proof of the needed iq was that these
[2:06:53] signs follow them that believe and that
[2:06:56] iq what's
[2:06:58] from god was to manifest christ to the
[2:07:01] people by signs and wonders following
[2:07:04] them that believe
[2:07:08] so
[2:07:09] now
[2:07:10] instead of giving psychiatrists given a
[2:07:12] mental test
[2:07:14] to test to see if a man
[2:07:16] qualifies for service
[2:07:18] believers should be given a test
[2:07:21] to whether he believes god's word or not
[2:07:23] that ought to be the credential of every
[2:07:25] preacher
[2:07:26] if you don't believe the word then
[2:07:28] there's something wrong with you
[2:07:29] spiritually and mentally
[2:07:31] what is needed is men with an experience
[2:07:33] who preaches god's word and his bible
[2:07:35] and has god's signs
[2:07:37] you see that the disciples never went
[2:07:40] before a psychiatrist
[2:07:42] i'm going somewhere with this
[2:07:44] but they waited in the upper room until
[2:07:47] they were filled with power from on high
[2:07:50] amen amen that education was not what
[2:07:53] qualified them nor credentials of a
[2:07:56] denomination but such as i have
[2:07:59] amen that was an authorization shown by
[2:08:02] the power that raised up a at
[2:08:05] the gate called beautiful
[2:08:06] and that's what qualified them
[2:08:08] could you imagine the disciples being
[2:08:11] required to be examined by psychiatrists
[2:08:13] first to see whether their response
[2:08:16] would be to a crisis of sin
[2:08:20] or you know their response to sin and
[2:08:22] weak character
[2:08:24] was not from an intellectual conception
[2:08:27] or scientific
[2:08:28] ideology but through the power of god
[2:08:30] that's how they responded but you see
[2:08:32] the cycle of of revival and death never
[2:08:35] fails
[2:08:37] and i'm telling you right now we got too
[2:08:40] many psychologists in the pulpit
[2:08:45] intellectual men
[2:08:48] who without a call from god
[2:08:52] are you with me
[2:08:53] amen jesus movement was existing
[2:08:56] drifting their behavior was becoming
[2:08:58] like the older denominations and they
[2:09:01] moved toward formalism and away from the
[2:09:03] holy ghost
[2:09:05] and this was true that every move of god
[2:09:08] began with the power of the holy ghost
[2:09:10] but as the revival waned the move become
[2:09:13] more and more secular and less spiritual
[2:09:15] in its approach to salvation and
[2:09:18] deliverance
[2:09:21] i'm trying to tell you why there's
[2:09:22] resistance to altar calls
[2:09:25] life changing experiences
[2:09:27] is because the church is backslidden
[2:09:31] it's a backslidden church that doesn't
[2:09:33] believe in prayer lines
[2:09:35] altar calls the power of the holy ghost
[2:09:40] and that introduces psychology
[2:09:44] to fix the problems
[2:09:47] counseling is not going to fix your
[2:09:49] problem
[2:09:51] the holy ghost baptism and a nature
[2:09:54] change is what's going to fix your
[2:09:56] problem
[2:10:00] amen i'll just tell you right now 20
[2:10:03] minutes on your knees and do you more
[2:10:04] good than 20 minutes in my office
[2:10:10] dying out to sin
[2:10:12] we'll do you more good for your marriage
[2:10:15] for your home for your family
[2:10:19] get rid of the bitterness get rid of the
[2:10:21] grudges
[2:10:23] get rid of the divisiveness
[2:10:24] [Applause]
[2:10:28] families are really actually imploding
[2:10:30] on each other trying to destroy one
[2:10:32] another what kind of spirit is that
[2:10:35] it's a spirit of the devil i'm going to
[2:10:37] call it what it is
[2:10:39] amen if you got a grudge against your
[2:10:41] brother your sister you got a devil on
[2:10:43] you deal with the thing
[2:10:46] psychology in a counseling session ain't
[2:10:48] gonna fix it it's when your nature gets
[2:10:51] changed and you get filled with the holy
[2:10:53] ghost
[2:10:56] now to give you the correct attitude
[2:10:58] toward your wife
[2:11:00] toward your finances
[2:11:02] towards your children towards your
[2:11:04] parents children
[2:11:10] amen but you see when the revival wanes
[2:11:14] you see it the church becomes the move
[2:11:17] comes toward more secular less spiritual
[2:11:20] approach
[2:11:21] to salvation and
[2:11:22] deliverance so they borrow from
[2:11:25] denominations
[2:11:27] i hadn't got to where i'm going yet hang
[2:11:28] on
[2:11:30] brother branham publicly denounced and
[2:11:32] warned against the changes that swept
[2:11:34] over the church
[2:11:35] as he watched the fall of the
[2:11:37] pentecostal azusa movement
[2:11:39] as it drifted toward use of worship or
[2:11:42] forms of worship without inner
[2:11:44] significance
[2:11:46] even speaking in tongues became
[2:11:48] manufactured and cheapened
[2:11:51] holiness was no longer an inner work of
[2:11:54] the heart
[2:11:55] so it was just rejected
[2:11:58] as just works and not grace
[2:12:00] when the true grace of god comes the
[2:12:02] favor of god in your life the holy ghost
[2:12:05] it changes your nature and your attitude
[2:12:08] towards your dress and your behavior
[2:12:12] amen but the azusa pentecostals could
[2:12:15] still work up external emotion
[2:12:18] but there was no lasting change inwardly
[2:12:23] and so that's why they started
[2:12:25] introducing psychology
[2:12:30] because without the power of the holy
[2:12:33] ghost in their life there was no change
[2:12:36] of character
[2:12:37] so we're dealing with people now
[2:12:40] that
[2:12:41] you know i've got sin in their lives
[2:12:44] and they're not prospering spiritually
[2:12:47] and they're lazy and different
[2:12:50] backslidden
[2:12:52] cold
[2:12:53] formal
[2:12:55] got sin in their lives
[2:12:57] and the pastor's now trying to deal with
[2:12:59] them but instead of the power of god a
[2:13:02] learned behavior from psychology
[2:13:06] was now being needed
[2:13:10] and the same happens again as the cycle
[2:13:14] repeats
[2:13:16] pastors bring in i ain't talking about
[2:13:19] pentecostal pastors
[2:13:21] i'm about message pastors bringing
[2:13:23] psychology
[2:13:25] teaching that the holy ghost is not an
[2:13:27] experience
[2:13:29] but something you just grow into
[2:13:33] dude did you know that some of our
[2:13:35] did you know that some of our mainstream
[2:13:38] churches i'm not talking about these out
[2:13:40] in perugia and thunders and then i'm
[2:13:42] talking about mainstream
[2:13:44] churches actually went or sent ministry
[2:13:48] to sit at the table
[2:13:50] of the seminars of the bonds women
[2:13:54] ismailites
[2:13:55] denominational people at their table to
[2:13:59] find out how to solve problems
[2:14:02] because of sin and marriage issues in
[2:14:04] their churches
[2:14:07] and this is because the supernatural
[2:14:10] birth
[2:14:11] is disdained and despised
[2:14:16] you see no experience of the baptism of
[2:14:18] the holy ghost is wanted or needed
[2:14:21] we sure don't want that altar call we
[2:14:23] don't want somebody snotting down the
[2:14:25] daughter you just evolved into a token
[2:14:27] life
[2:14:32] you see they somehow believe that you
[2:14:34] just grow out of your sin problem
[2:14:37] oh we see a little makeup on our kids
[2:14:39] you know young people they'll grow out
[2:14:41] of that
[2:14:44] no they won't
[2:14:49] you see
[2:14:51] the thought that a learned behavior
[2:14:53] instead of the power of god changing a
[2:14:56] life
[2:14:56] comes because of a bankrupt church
[2:15:02] bankrupt from the power of god
[2:15:05] the bible said in second corinthians 5
[2:15:08] 17
[2:15:09] therefore if any man be in christ he is
[2:15:11] a new creature brother branham always
[2:15:12] said a creation
[2:15:14] all things are passed away behold all
[2:15:16] things become new
[2:15:18] so when you're a new creation come on
[2:15:22] all things are passed away behold all
[2:15:24] things become new so you must be born
[2:15:26] again by the holy ghost and made a new
[2:15:28] creation where all the old things pass
[2:15:31] away sin
[2:15:33] worldliness
[2:15:34] desires it's music
[2:15:37] it stops its books
[2:15:40] amen it's it's
[2:15:43] it's feminism
[2:15:46] every bit of it
[2:15:48] amen pass away
[2:15:50] and all things all things become new
[2:15:54] you see sarah had to be renewed
[2:15:59] now look
[2:16:00] i'm one of those old-fashioned kind i
[2:16:03] don't believe in this evolution stuff i
[2:16:05] believe that creation began with a big
[2:16:07] bang
[2:16:10] the word spoken became an action
[2:16:13] and the power that god released brought
[2:16:16] a universe into existence
[2:16:19] i believe also that this earth and the
[2:16:22] light upon it and the contaminated
[2:16:24] universe will be extinguished and will
[2:16:27] pass away with a great noise
[2:16:33] amen so you see that's what will happen
[2:16:36] to the earth
[2:16:37] heavens and earth will pass so we'll
[2:16:39] pass away our heavens will pass away
[2:16:41] with a great noise the bible said is
[2:16:43] that right amen the whole earth will be
[2:16:46] on fire brother branham taught this in
[2:16:48] future home
[2:16:50] amen he told us you know the fire the
[2:16:52] earth will be on fire they'll ignite the
[2:16:54] gases on the earth and explode it and he
[2:16:57] said the heavens and earth will pass
[2:16:59] away such an explosion will rock it it's
[2:17:02] going to kill every disease every
[2:17:04] thistle every thorn everything should be
[2:17:07] done the fire will burn it up and
[2:17:09] remember it's not just a literal fire
[2:17:11] it's a holy fire and it will take satan
[2:17:14] away and all his devils
[2:17:17] hallelujah then he goes on and said when
[2:17:19] you know when a man receives a baptism
[2:17:21] of fire there's a lot of noise around
[2:17:24] there they think it's a shame to hear
[2:17:26] people scream and shout like that just
[2:17:29] wait to the earth gets her baptism
[2:17:32] amen and when your old flesh gets this
[2:17:35] baptism of fire
[2:17:37] it kills out sin
[2:17:39] adultery
[2:17:41] pornography
[2:17:42] the world said
[2:17:45] and it passes away with a great noise
[2:17:49] hallelujah with a new creation
[2:17:55] it burns out all sin
[2:17:58] and sin nature and desire for sin is
[2:18:02] done away with
[2:18:09] i believe that's what happens to the
[2:18:10] fallen man of humanity
[2:18:13] when he comes to christ it happens with
[2:18:15] a big bang
[2:18:16] it cleanses you from sin
[2:18:19] you see it don't take psychology
[2:18:22] there's no gradual nature change
[2:18:27] it's a new creation with a big bang
[2:18:31] old things are passed away
[2:18:33] the love for sin
[2:18:35] sin nature is desires its lust all pass
[2:18:39] away and behold all things become new
[2:18:44] amen
[2:18:46] now let me just give you the signs of a
[2:18:48] bankrupt church
[2:18:51] if the church was truly spiritually rich
[2:18:54] because that's what laodicea claims i'm
[2:18:56] rich
[2:18:57] its influence would be felt upon
[2:18:59] community life
[2:19:00] but exactly what kind of lives are these
[2:19:02] so-called spiritual and influential men
[2:19:05] of the community live and out in the
[2:19:06] suburbia are out in the better class
[2:19:09] districts there are balanced wife
[2:19:11] swapping prostitution bands of children
[2:19:15] crashing parties exacting terrible toll
[2:19:18] and property damage immorality
[2:19:20] has reached an all-time high in
[2:19:22] promiscuous sex acts and narcotic
[2:19:25] addictions and gambling and stealing and
[2:19:28] all kinds of evils
[2:19:31] that's what happens in suburbia what
[2:19:33] happens in the slums
[2:19:35] in the inner cities murders
[2:19:39] shootings every night
[2:19:42] and the same kind of morality immorality
[2:19:44] that's in the suburbs is even more in
[2:19:47] the slums
[2:19:51] so the church ain't having too much
[2:19:52] effect
[2:19:54] on the community is it
[2:19:57] so he said the church goes on claiming
[2:19:59] how fine is this generation how full of
[2:20:02] the churches and how responsive are the
[2:20:04] natives on the mission fields the
[2:20:06] churches turn the people over to doctors
[2:20:09] even especially the psychiatrists how it
[2:20:12] can pract about being spiritually rich
[2:20:15] is more than i know of it it isn't true
[2:20:18] they are bankrupt and don't know it
[2:20:24] come on now
[2:20:26] and we're a bankrupt church
[2:20:30] when we have to depend on
[2:20:34] psychology
[2:20:37] to fix our children
[2:20:39] and psychology to fix our marriage and
[2:20:42] psychology to understand how to save
[2:20:46] your pennies and and pay off your debts
[2:20:48] and be responsible with your money
[2:20:51] i'll tell you what you really need is
[2:20:53] the holy ghost
[2:20:56] it'll change your attitude about life
[2:21:00] amen some of you who never tithe will
[2:21:03] start tithing
[2:21:04] you put god first
[2:21:07] you give offerings unto the lord you'll
[2:21:09] see the fruits of it
[2:21:13] amen you'll see some principles start
[2:21:15] happening in your life i'm talking the
[2:21:17] truth now you'll see some changes start
[2:21:20] happening
[2:21:22] you there'll be attitude changes about
[2:21:24] work
[2:21:25] about family
[2:21:26] about your friends
[2:21:28] your associates
[2:21:31] your business dealings
[2:21:33] everything comes under the holy ghost
[2:21:39] but today pastors are desperate because
[2:21:42] of sin
[2:21:43] they're using psychology to conform or
[2:21:45] reform their people
[2:21:48] and this is used in marriage counseling
[2:21:50] money management
[2:21:53] and i'm going back several several years
[2:21:55] ago now
[2:21:56] the rage was bill gothard this is what
[2:21:59] i'd hear among the pastors
[2:22:01] bill gothard
[2:22:02] and message pastors went to went to
[2:22:04] classes by bill gothard to learn how to
[2:22:07] get character development
[2:22:10] you know to get character development
[2:22:13] into the christians you know uh to help
[2:22:16] with their marriages to learn principles
[2:22:19] of how to be a a family and christian
[2:22:22] educational and they were going out here
[2:22:25] to the ishmael's lights
[2:22:28] to bill gothard
[2:22:29] to learn his psychology to bring it i'm
[2:22:33] not talking about pentecost out here
[2:22:35] listen brother branham decried the
[2:22:37] pentecostals for putting their people
[2:22:40] out there before psychiatrists
[2:22:42] i got the right to do the same thing to
[2:22:44] message people
[2:22:46] and hold them accountable for bringing
[2:22:48] psychology into the church
[2:22:51] and it was because of backslidden
[2:22:53] preachers who denied the power of god
[2:22:57] who spurned the movement of the holy
[2:22:59] ghost
[2:23:02] and the problem with bill gothard was
[2:23:05] after all his seminars on marriage and
[2:23:07] christian living was caught up in sex
[2:23:09] scandals himself
[2:23:11] what he taught didn't even work on
[2:23:13] himself
[2:23:15] and then these things pastors listen i'm
[2:23:17] not lying
[2:23:18] you go to convention and laying out with
[2:23:21] books on james dobson
[2:23:23] christian psychology
[2:23:26] and and out here take these home read
[2:23:28] these learn this this will help you with
[2:23:31] your rebellious child this is going to
[2:23:32] help you with your marriage this is
[2:23:34] going to help you with your finances and
[2:23:36] and this is where we're going to fix the
[2:23:38] problems of the church
[2:23:40] not with an altar call
[2:23:43] not with a consecration to god not by
[2:23:46] surrenders to the holy ghost
[2:23:48] but by psychology
[2:23:51] which was boring from the israelites
[2:23:56] the bomb's woman
[2:23:58] whilst guarding the holy ghost
[2:24:03] amen i know i know exactly what i'm
[2:24:06] talking about let me tell you something
[2:24:08] friendship don't hybrid this message
[2:24:11] don't mix psychology in it amen god's
[2:24:15] word plus psychology produces
[2:24:18] psychoheresy
[2:24:21] you see true christianity does not
[2:24:23] change the mind it gives a new mind
[2:24:27] amen james dobson you read about him he
[2:24:30] went to the vatican united with the pope
[2:24:33] oh he did you see it's a bankrupt church
[2:24:37] that uses psychology to reform his
[2:24:39] people
[2:24:40] the gospel is not about reforming it's
[2:24:44] about transforming
[2:24:47] amen and i just say quit defending
[2:24:50] psychology repent of that
[2:24:55] amen
[2:24:56] preaching the gospel does not move the
[2:24:58] man
[2:24:59] it does move the mind to man and it's
[2:25:01] thinking from sin and worldliness toward
[2:25:04] christ and changing his mind and setting
[2:25:06] his affections upon things above in
[2:25:09] order to bring in repentance but only
[2:25:11] filling the soul with god changing the
[2:25:13] nature doesn't have the desired effect
[2:25:16] of salvation
[2:25:18] the indwelling of the holy ghost is the
[2:25:20] only true change
[2:25:23] it's the holy ghost that dissolves fears
[2:25:26] and gives it inward peace
[2:25:29] amen it changes the entertainment of the
[2:25:32] spirit from dirty carnal music and jokes
[2:25:36] to an old-fashioned praise for god
[2:25:39] amen it puts a love for god in your
[2:25:41] heart it puts a desire for righteousness
[2:25:46] you see introducing psychology to change
[2:25:49] behavior does not deal with the root
[2:25:51] problem of sin
[2:25:52] it only helps with the symptoms
[2:25:56] you see the the root problem is still
[2:25:58] there ready to raise up at the most
[2:26:00] inopportune time
[2:26:02] amen but instead of psychiatrists
[2:26:05] believers or have the leadership of the
[2:26:07] holy ghost directing our thoughts and
[2:26:10] our attitudes and it changes our lives
[2:26:13] and our behaviors by giving us the mind
[2:26:15] of christ
[2:26:16] american the mind of christ is the holy
[2:26:19] ghost
[2:26:21] it causes us to have a christ-like
[2:26:23] attitude and outlook on sin
[2:26:27] so you see the last plague of spiritual
[2:26:29] death
[2:26:31] oh my
[2:26:33] what are you seeing embalming fluid
[2:26:36] put into the church
[2:26:39] let me tell you something the holy ghost
[2:26:41] is not outdated it still works
[2:26:45] i can testify it'll make sainted men and
[2:26:48] women
[2:26:50] amen brother bradham said how many
[2:26:52] understands when else shall i that he
[2:26:55] gave his own strength in abraham he
[2:26:57] never did nothing but made him promise
[2:26:59] his promises but now he's emptying
[2:27:01] himself out into abraham literally
[2:27:06] when you're filled with the holy ghost
[2:27:07] it's the person of christ himself the
[2:27:09] person not imagination not some kind of
[2:27:12] psychology but the person of the holy
[2:27:15] ghost
[2:27:17] you see he nursed
[2:27:19] from
[2:27:20] he nursed the literal life of god into
[2:27:23] him
[2:27:24] so having this literal life of god
[2:27:26] flowing in makes him believe in the
[2:27:29] supernatural
[2:27:30] the holy ghost makes you believe
[2:27:33] it's not an external religion
[2:27:35] but it's on the inside working out
[2:27:38] it flows like a river of water
[2:27:42] it bubbles up into eternal life
[2:27:45] like the spring that brother branham saw
[2:27:47] and he said what makes you so bubbly and
[2:27:48] happy is it because i drink out of your
[2:27:51] rabbits and deer or whatever he said no
[2:27:53] there's a power down there that is
[2:27:55] pushing up this water
[2:27:57] amen and it's making me bubble and he
[2:28:00] said there's something about the baptism
[2:28:02] of the holy ghost amen it makes him
[2:28:04] believe the supernatural it makes him
[2:28:07] believe in god
[2:28:08] amen it makes him believe he's the same
[2:28:10] yesterday today and forever and if
[2:28:13] you're born of god you will believe in
[2:28:15] the supernatural
[2:28:18] amen i'll tell you what we got proof of
[2:28:20] it
[2:28:21] we got the young pre people we got
[2:28:23] people right here that have been
[2:28:25] transformed by the power of god
[2:28:28] one after another that we can call it
[2:28:29] wasn't just easy believism their life
[2:28:32] was changed
[2:28:34] hallelujah what happened to you brother
[2:28:36] johnny amen your life got changed amen
[2:28:40] you didn't get reformed you got
[2:28:42] transformed
[2:28:43] [Applause]
[2:28:44] amen it was but it was not without
[2:28:47] emotion it had emotion with it
[2:28:50] it was with not without sensation it's
[2:28:52] not sensation but it has sensation with
[2:28:55] it
[2:28:56] amen that's why the prophet of god cried
[2:28:58] out against emotion without the word or
[2:29:02] word without emotion
[2:29:06] but you see
[2:29:08] brother branham said in question answers
[2:29:11] he said
[2:29:13] take it by the scripture if a man that's
[2:29:15] born of god
[2:29:18] is born of god he believes every word of
[2:29:20] god wrote and says he's just as great
[2:29:23] today as he ever was
[2:29:25] and he never changes and he's the same
[2:29:28] yesterday today and forever and if he's
[2:29:30] filled with the holy ghost he got the
[2:29:32] same holy ghost that he got that he gave
[2:29:35] on the day of pentecost and it makes him
[2:29:37] act the same way and do the same thing
[2:29:39] if he's born of the spirit of god mark
[2:29:41] 16 these signs shall follow them to
[2:29:43] believe if he says i'm a believer and
[2:29:46] them signs don't follow he's a
[2:29:47] make-believer not a believer
[2:29:53] oh
[2:29:55] they claim
[2:29:56] today
[2:29:59] we don't have the holy ghost like they
[2:30:00] had on the day of pentecost
[2:30:03] they claim we got something different
[2:30:06] they claimed that 1906
[2:30:09] was
[2:30:10] the upper room happened again
[2:30:13] and it wasn't
[2:30:15] that's a lie
[2:30:17] 1906 of zeus of pentecost was the holy
[2:30:20] spirit baptizing with gifts
[2:30:23] that's not we have we have the person
[2:30:28] come on
[2:30:29] justification made way for
[2:30:31] sanctification sanctification made way
[2:30:33] for the baptism of the holy ghost which
[2:30:35] gave the gift and the baptism of the
[2:30:37] holy ghost gives way to the person
[2:30:39] himself
[2:30:42] you see this is what god wanted them to
[2:30:45] have they wanted to have his own life
[2:30:48] into the church
[2:30:53] and brother branham identified himself
[2:30:55] with the same holy ghost that fell on
[2:30:57] the day of pentecost
[2:31:00] now
[2:31:00] so we are false teachers
[2:31:03] with a false birth
[2:31:05] the children of this word are not empty
[2:31:08] bubble dancers
[2:31:10] that's not who we are but we are people
[2:31:12] who live higher
[2:31:15] than what we jump
[2:31:18] amen neither are we a bunch of stillborn
[2:31:21] mixed between sheep and goats
[2:31:23] amen who never breathed the breath of
[2:31:25] life stillborn babies but the holy ghost
[2:31:28] that's still born you know just they're
[2:31:30] just lifeless blobs of theology
[2:31:34] and that's what the church is producing
[2:31:36] they lifeless blobs
[2:31:39] of
[2:31:40] theology who can't live without
[2:31:43] overcoming life
[2:31:45] but we're showing you an isaac
[2:31:49] a child of the supernatural
[2:31:53] and you can make fun of him and you can
[2:31:55] walk him oh you want to at this
[2:31:57] celebration
[2:31:59] but i tell you what it's proof that the
[2:32:02] rapture is at hand
[2:32:03] because there is a church being renewed
[2:32:07] like she was on the day of pentecost and
[2:32:10] that's why she's bringing back forth and
[2:32:12] isaac
[2:32:15] hallelujah
[2:32:17] you see false teachers will bring false
[2:32:19] false births
[2:32:21] amen false prophets bring forth false
[2:32:23] births
[2:32:28] and we're seeing it false births being
[2:32:30] brought
[2:32:31] but there's also a birth that's coming
[2:32:33] forth
[2:32:34] that burst you back to the place where
[2:32:36] you should have been born at the
[2:32:38] beginning
[2:32:40] where god's bringing forth sons and
[2:32:42] daughters of god i can point you to a
[2:32:44] word-born pride
[2:32:46] that's what we're pointing to a word
[2:32:48] born bride
[2:32:49] i'm pointing you that we're having a
[2:32:51] feast
[2:32:53] amen we can feast on every promise
[2:32:57] amen right here from this pulpit and
[2:33:00] other pulpits like it around the world
[2:33:01] we're not the only one by any means
[2:33:04] amen there's many others that are
[2:33:06] proclaiming the truth
[2:33:07] they can pray they can preach the seven
[2:33:09] thunders
[2:33:11] they can preach the mystery revealed
[2:33:13] they can preach the silence that's been
[2:33:15] broken
[2:33:16] amen they can identify the church ages
[2:33:19] and and the spirits down to the angels
[2:33:22] they can identify the messenger somebody
[2:33:25] help me preach they can it's all on the
[2:33:27] table
[2:33:28] but on our table is every divine promise
[2:33:32] amen on our table is divine healing
[2:33:36] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[2:33:37] they shall recover amen they're in on
[2:33:40] our table is the holy ghost
[2:33:43] and the power of god and the salvation
[2:33:45] and it's not just a psychology it's the
[2:33:48] holy ghost at work
[2:33:50] are you with me church
[2:33:52] that's what we're having in this day oh
[2:33:54] word bird bride and word born children
[2:34:00] acts 2 38 tongues preaching
[2:34:03] blabbering shouting screaming

[2:34:06] and if you see us getting a little happy
[2:34:09] we're having a feast
[2:34:12] and if you see us shouting a little bit
[2:34:15] and acting a little unseemly it's called
[2:34:17] life supernatural life is being
[2:34:20] manifested
[2:34:23] and if you see rejoicing and shouting
[2:34:26] and people they're running the aisles
[2:34:29] don't knock us and make fun of us join
[2:34:31] in with us

[2:34:42] me alike steal your joy
