comes to every appointment he'll never turn you down he'll be right for you in the every need that you have and he said I'll never leave you or forsake you what a promise that is what a promise as we think about the meetings coming up I wanted to just tell you you know we start Thursday night at 7:00 Friday night at 7 Saturday night there will be a a prayer line so we're going to start at 5:00 and then we'll have Sunday morning at 11:00 but I just want to remind you too we will not be having a Wednesday night service so you know we certainly want you to be in prayer for these meetings I believe God's going to do some wonderful things God has um laid it on our hearts to have brother Tom brother Michael Ray also brother Ron Spencer for this weekend coming up and of course the meetings actually in some ways really start today right with our brother David mayor here he's has a church there right in the edge of France we say switzland France you fly into switzland and go to France just across the border but we love Brother David and I so appreciate his love for the Lord his Zeal for Christ and so you know as we just prepare our hearts for the word to come and forth and for the meetings I want you to start thinking Lord oh yes oh yes I I maybe there's things I need to empty out of my life to make room for you maybe some things that I've got too busy and with life or just let things little things you know there little foxes that spoil the vine and little things that that is kind of sleping as creping I I want to just see that there are some things that are changed in my life I don't want to be the same and when we when we come to a meeting like this we all should come with you know to to find out where our weak spots are and how little we are and you know why so we can put our trust in a god who's strong and who's more than able so you know as we prepare for the word today open up your heart to the Lord and say Here's my cup Lord fill it up I want you just to come my life in a greater way and a greater portion than ever so let's let's sing that song as our brother David mayor comes and you open your heart to the word today and let him speak to you say here's my cup think about it now if it's filled up with other things you're not going to get much you'll really be able to say my cup run it's over because you didn't even get a teaspoon in but if you just empty out yes your pride your ways your thoughts of put it all aside right now and just say Lord I want to empty that out and be filled with you Bread of Heaven feed me and you are the Bread of Heaven just feed me until it just so overflows I can hold no more here's my cup inviting to your Pew this morning as the word Goes Forth in Jesus name sing it to him now with all your heart make it your prayer here's my cup Lord I Lift It Up Lord come and quit distur thir of my [Music] soul Bread of Heaven feed me too I want know [Music] one more [Music] time come and qu the Sing My Soul of Heaven Le me to I want no here's my it and make me whole amen is that your deepest desire if that is your deepest desire I have good news this morning cuz when there's a deep calling this morning there's a deep to respond to that's why I'm asking is that your deepest desire there's many things going on this in this world but this is my moment not just an additional service thank God for the service but this is my moment is the most essential time in your life we had service after service but right now that's right I want to meet God you know we live in perilous times we can hear about Israel Prophet tells us that's God's times PE Time piece we see scripture after scripture prophecy after prophecy being fulfilled before your our eyes and the prophet says as Israel was blinded so that the Gentiles could come in now the Gentiles are blinded so the bride can be taken out and Israel can receive the Feast of the trumpets think about the junk Junction of time we're living in you may think it's going on far away hey no matter how far it is God is here for us this morning he keeps on saying about Israel the time pieace there's troubles Wars rumors earthquakes perplexed times we can say Amen to that distress in every place in every nation he says I haven't seen a nation that is trembling in their shoes think of it nations are trembling and we have the grace the privilege to be standing on Holy Ground this morning we are a privileged people that God wants to meet with us while I was flying over tape came up conference with God so that's what this meeting is about not because Brother David Brother David is a nobody he's a sinner saved by grace but because he is here for you but unless like brother Tim said you open up let's put aside every strong hold you may think it's a little it's a stronghold that is against the word of God cast down reasoning and only believe and you will see the glory of God do you know that our time talks about the Gentile he says it's shocking isn't it to know that we have a limited time don't think because you're young or because you're old that I've got all my life ahead of me we have a limited time so let's take every moment we can yes sir to receive more from God is that your desire and you know just as introduction I was reading and brother brandham he says he wants to lift you up he calls John he says come up hither John the type of the Bride come up hither this morning come up hither put aside all your worries all your burdens everything that God will try that that Satan will try to put on you and God tells you come up hither [Music] come in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus he says he lifts you up on the wings of Eagle he packs you out on the old stinky things the world gives you they are stink stinky whatever Satan can propose you can it's thinking but he wants to bring you in Heavenly places you know when you're in Heavenly places when you're in Christ Jesus you know what the Prophet says where all things are possible do we have Believers here this morning do we want to go into this realm no we were in three dimension no in this Dimension where all things are possible how many have a need this morning don't don't lift your hands for the for the ministry lift your hands to your lord and savior I am needy Lift Me Up Lord I want to come in this realm where all things are possible because I believe in your word amen all things are possible that's what we want to receive if there's anything the Church of the Living God needs this morning he says it's another jump from all the barriers of denomination of isms just cut loose everything every line and go free that's my prayer for this morning cuz there where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty there is freedom and that's for each and every one of you and that's God's desire so let us create the atmosphere he says what we need that's just opening up because we are in a sacred moment this [Music] morning the time is [Music] limited I see young boys Brothers standing here and Elder the time is limited yes when the Trump shall sound in the twinkling of an [Music] eye we shall be changed and be raptured are you Rapture Ready that's why I want to receive more this morning make sure that I got a refilling I got a blessing last week glory be to God I want another one this [Applause] morning I've got healed two weeks ago well and and and I had another now another sickness well he's still the Healer he's still the Savior he's still the deliverer [Music] what we need is the Holy Ghost atmosphere an atmosphere where the power of God is moving are we in one Accord we are here gathered in one place but are we in one [Music] Accord well Brother David I'm thinking of buying a new car buying a house getting married doing this that and the other you can have many plans that is wonderful God bless you but this morning are we in one mind and one Accord I want to see Jesus I'm asking you Saints that's my prayer I want to see Jesus moving meeting after meeting after meeting he's the same God he is the same this morning he can do anything for you amen if we can create that atmosphere and it's a reality he says let's move oursel up into the bracket step in faith and let's move out of these three dimensions where you lose yourself in the power of God you don't even know where am I who am I I'm in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus and you know everything is happened everything is possible listen to that before reading the word let every man woman in this building this morning every boy or girl get everything from their minds can we be in one Accord amen many things are are happening even after church for the upcoming meetings and so on but now this is our moment let every man the prophet makes it clear every man every woman in this building boy or go girl get everything from their mind but the Lord Jesus and believe that he's standing here right now you'll see something happening that's a promise he gives us you'll see with your eyes you'll experience yourself right now and you'll see something happening that'll cause headlines in the newspaper think about it I don't know what the the newspaper is called here in Louisiana Daily Mail Louisiana I don't know I don't care Vote for This president vote for the Israel Russia this that forget about that there's a bride [Music] preparing God is still alive and still is doing great things think about it amen a sick God healed amen a blind God recovered his sight a crippled walk that's if every boy every man every every woman like the prophet says can get everything from their mind but the Lord Jesus that's when you will see him and that is my prayer that is my desire and that's God's desire for us this morning so if you don't want the blessing let me have yours I take double portions triple portions I'm serious Saints this is a crucial moment don't think we have plenty of time left we are at the end of the end of the end of the end of the end timeall so we better run with all that is within us because we have a high calling hallelujah [Music] amen cuz God wants to bless us and he indeed will bless us so God bless you Saints while we take the Bible thank you musicians if you continue playing I'll Hallelujah but keep that atmosphere while you go to 2 Corinthians 4 I want to thank brother Tim with all my heart for the love and he's so precious to us and God has blessed you hey church you can do better than [Applause] that God has blessed you I'm not saying that to lift up my friend but he's a precious friend that stands for the truth and he's always a available no matter when you call him ready Tim what about this boom here he goes he takes time we love you brother Tim and the whole Ministry the church God bless you bring greetings from the church back home amen they sure would love to be here but couldn't make it but I'm glad my wife made it I'm very glad my wife sister an I don't know where she is God bless you and my daughter Jessica sister Jessica is also here so part of the family made it amen very happy for that amen and we are God's family our our bonds go Way Beyond I'm born in Louisiana in Switzerland Belgium whatever I hey we were together before the foundation of the world Amen that's why it's so good to see you again amen let's go to to Corinth Ians 4 verse 6 say Amen when you're there amen for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ but we have this treasure in Earth vessels that Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed Hallelujah always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body amen let's go to John 1 a familiar scripture verse one in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shined in darkness and the Darkness comprehend it not now comprehend in the Lexicon it says to lay hold of or to take possession or overtaking another translation says the darkness has not overcome it so we live in a dark age but it will not overcome because he is the light and when when you are in the light there is no Darkness so let's be in Christ Jesus in Heavenly places amen where all things are possible no matter what the darkness may say you know that you know that you know that he is the light personally to you Hallelujah another scripture in 1 John 5 verse one whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and everyone that loveth him that begat loveed him also that is begotten of him by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Comm Commandments are not Grievous for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith let God add the blessing to the reading of his word let's have a word of prayer Our precious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you Father for your love Your Grace towards us father for another opportunity to be standing in the presence of the almighty God lord you know each and everyone that is present here even those that are streaming Lord you know the needs of your people and father Lord we have confessed Lord that we want to be in one mind and one Accord laying aside everything all our thoughts every stronghold and just keeping our eyes on Jesus Christ knowing without a shame shadow of a doubt father that you are here to meet with us Lord God so I pray father may you speak through the vessels Lord God I say surrender to you father May something be said Lord to your people Lord that transform their life Lord that gives such a a comfort such a peace such a love such a baptism oh Father you are the same God for us this morning so take control over this this service Lord God we ask these things in the almighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the church says amen and amen you may be seated Hall thank you amen so can I ask you to preach with me is that okay young and old young and old Hallelujah I love it when when the Saints become partakers not Spectators the Lord told us to be partakers of his divine nature it's not a I want to be a partaker I want to play my role I want to pull on the word I want to receive my blessing amen hallelujah so this morning amen for a title I'd like to take my victory dance in the open book so I want to make it very personal I said my victory dance in the open book because it's not a group Affair it's not oh this this church or that church it's an individual Affair you and God and you need to have all your victory dance in the open book is that okay so we see amen we read that God is light so what is light let's go in there for a moment light is the absence of Darkness light is the essence of life without the Sun's light we would have no plants no food no vegetables nothing no existence so everything our planet depends on the sun rising every day producing its energy filled raay that's the natural come on Saints now what about the spiritual their energy filled raise here this morning from the light of the s o n shining on the predestinated seed Hallelujah charge me once again Lord [Applause] the prophet says what is light the Vindicated spoken word of God outside of that there is no light Hallelujah so outside of the word of God the revealed word of God there is no light we see in Genesis 2 where he said I am and the prophet says J Ju B Yahweh Jehovah what did it mean I am the all existent one who has created something of myself to be a son of mine or a temporary amateur little one of mine building up now he says Glory why Jehovah means that he gave man to be an amature God my he is Father God and he made a man an amature God so he isn't self-existing anymore he exists with his family I I told you we are family I'm glad you accept me and your family but one thing is my father accepted me amen and then he says amen he exists with his family el el Elohim amen Jehovah meaning the one who exists with his family so then the prophet he says he was God the logos I know you're well taught you heard it before I'm not going to preach anything new I have no Doctrine to the I I keep saying it I have one doctrine that is Jesus Christ and he is the one I'm preaching about amen so he says the logos the word that went out of God in begin it began to brood upon the Earth it brought forth marine life amen when the spirit of God the logos the word which God said let there be and they win the logos which is the word of God and the word of God the whole word of God the whole Bible for every age so don't think the word of God is out of cater is outdated that's Satan trying to put in your mind that you need something new you don't need anything you God has given us an open book amen and are we going to get to that that's why you can have a victory dance because Victory in Jesus my Savior forever forever [Applause] forever Satan tries to put some time on it but he's still the same this morning morning for you if you have a need and if you don't have a need believe me you need to come to the altar so we will pray for you because we have a need of more of God he said there is so many untapped resources come on Church the time is right now that we go and plunge ourself in Jesus and get these untapped resources these rays of the s o n on the seed of God God hallelujah amen the whole word of God for every age amen hallelujah thank God for the word now I love what the prophet says he says now that same logos are you with me has a part he has got a bride a word bride that's right he has got a bride and the same logos this word cannot be tampered with is rooing over the church today trying to bring back the word to what to its full manifestation to its full manifestation think of it Saint he needs us for his full manifestation the prophet even says it different without you I'm including myself he he isn't complete think of it Saints Satan tries to tell you your little nobody Satan tries to put all these demons on you depression suicide all these things and here God tells you I've chosen you I want to manifest my word through you and without you I'm not complete talking about a victory dance amen amen it's good the preacher says it but what about you let's be partakers amen every one of us has a role to play we'll get to that so in God there were attributes an attribute is a thought amen and he spoke it it and it was a word and the Word was made manifest and it was the word made manifest it's God becoming material God becoming material look to your neighbor that's God becoming material that's what God wants to do now there's Darkness covering the whole Earth but upon you in you his glory shall be seen shall be manifested Hallelujah talking about perilous time yes but for the bride it's a glorious time amen because there's a Time and Eternity that is blending together the prophet says we're bumping in the angels and one song Glad morning when all will be over when the last seed comes in I'm going to take a [Applause] Rapture anybody wants to come with [Applause] me preach with me hallelujah amen so Darkness will not overtake it will not take possession over God's light that's why Satan is against the word of God is against Revelation but I love Revelation not a revelation that a man can give you that a group can give you but God gives you a personal experience a personal experience where you know for yourself not what mama says not what daddy says what you say hallelujah amen we know that Eve she fell from Satan's scheme against the word of God you know what by reasoning yeah that's why I asked you can we be all in one Accord lay aside everything every reasoning everything that is going on in your life oh I don't know if Brother David I don't know if God can still answer he can still save me if he can still do for something for me let me tell you you're in the right place at the right moment if you can just lay aside every birth burden everything contrary to the word of God and just keep Jesus on your mind you will see something you will see something where the headlines they will be jealous right why because we know amen when you have a personal experience you know that God is still alive and that Darkness will not comprehend that's right it won't overtake you maybe in distress oh but not abandoned maybe going through a trial but not forgotten come on Saints it's not just a nice story it's a reality Hallelujah you know when the word of God is being preached and the spirit of God is moving amen and demons are cast out brother Tim he Timothy he mentioned something last night we're just talking about hunting so oh yeah we going to go hunting tomorrow come on we going to go demon hunting because that's the time amen where Mark 16 is still applied the scripture that is the most debated is it still applicable oh yes it is still applicable in the name of Jesus demons has to flee when we were in maish's Island brother Joe and myself while was preaching the word the presence of the go of the Lord swept over the building there was such a presence of God there were families that were in the in the message in church that hated each other think about it brother Tim spoke every little thing every little thing here's my cup Lord so there was hatred but in the presence of the Lord you know what happened they ran to each other forgive me forgive me because they knew that they needed Jesus and that's what is going on here this morning yes that's what is going on we need Jesus more than yesterday yesterday was wonderful but I need more of him this morning and that applies from the youngest that's why I love the quote brother brandham said every man every woman every boy and girl yes I need Jesus Hallelujah so Eve she listens to the reasoning my She Fell From Grace by listening to Satan's lie after God had fortified her behind his word if she would have stayed behind the word the word she would have never fell think think of it that's right sometimes we fall do you know why it is because we're not behind the word brother Tim can preach and sometimes yes it's the word of God is a two-edged sword sometimes oh yes it's good for correction we never get many amens on that yeah we don't like that but that applies to us too don't think it's just what we preach that's what applies to us too but the word Inc is always in season we don't want a lecture we want an anointed [Applause] preaching but when the word corrects us we should be the fastest ones to say here am I but Satan tries to battle and say no no no no here he here he goes again cast down reason everything every stronghold that goes against the word of God because it's for you good if God is correcting you my well you just said well or those who said amen that you wanted to go in the Rapture amen and to go in the Rapture you need the token applied without the Holy Ghost there is no Rapture so that's why I need I want every church every service sorry every moment to get another portion oh yes so when you get out of the word that's when you start reasoning let's continue Satan Prophet says he quoted the word he didn't say that he quoted the word I hope my French or Belgian accent that you understands it he quoted the word he said quote it Cote it Cote it c o a t e d you got it he didn't quoted it he says it was like putting icing on a cake oh it looks so good yes but it comes from hell all this nonsense we hear against the word of God comes from Hellen that's right that's what they try to do that today they try to whitewash it says the prophet you know what whitewash means is to alter in a way that forces or caters the people they become catered I can I'm okay with something not pure word no you're not okay you're on a slippery [Applause] Road and people you know the religious Spirits are oh they're so strong yeah be oh Hallelujah all is well really go ahead you need Jesus more than yesterday that's right and as long as long as you oh I'm okay I'm okay no I hope I don't I don't offend you but it's the truth so many people think oh I'm going all as well you have to lay aside everything every little brother Brown calls it ISM every little thing that is against the word because I need Jesus amen it got to be everything it got to be Everything Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's why oh that's one of my favorite quotes and I'm sure I'm going to get a big amen here he says now remember Christ in the true church is what a continuation of the book of Acts so there's not an end date at the continuation of the book of Acts we just read that he wants to manifest his work through us so there is going on all over the world the spirit is moving come on church amen there's a continuation of the book of that we can say we had wonderful meetings last week yes that's right glory be to God but this is another opportunity to receive more from God and if you lose that desire that thirst you know when you're in a desert when you're in a desert you don't feel like drinking you don't feel like drinking but they tell you you have to drink because you will become dried up and that's what we have people are in church sitting like dried sticks amen you know how the prophet says like a dying caloo I'm just quoting the prophet hey I don't want to be like a dying Cal I want to be like a true worshipper amen the one that worships in spirit and in truth amen the woman at the well when she met Jesus the woman who was not worthy the woman who had oh of of ill Fame amen but she went to the well and some of us have come here we don't even we don't know why we wonder why but hey let me tell you Jesus oh he has an appointment with you this morning this woman B life no matter oh how many sins how great the sins were are you hearing me she had an appointment a conference with God and you know what Jesus said the ones that the father is looking for I'm paraphrasing are those that worship Him in spirit and in truth those so the father is seeking those that are willing to worship him in in spirit and in truth now let me tell you the truth is being spoken behind this pulpit and when you receive the word not in your mind but in your soul something will stir something will happen and you will answer amen you can be a dying Cal you can be a dried stick come on when you're in the Shina Glory Saints amen a dead dried up stick amen overnight produce fruits fruits of the spirit that's what he wants from us no church goers no church goers but partakers of his divine nature hallelujah amen there the amen Christ and the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts amen and we know that the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Christ Spirit would come into the church and defile it how making it lukewarm any lukewarm amongst us come to the front hey I have Liberty I'm at my home Church brother Tim making it lukewarm formal and Powerless powerless but it ain't over there it doesn't stop there it exposes Satan revealing his words attempted destruction of God's people and discrediting of God's word That's what Satan tries to do to each and every one of you when you go through a trial sickness family troubles all kinds of troubles yeah Satan playing with your mind when you're standing on the Rock of Ages the weak will say I am strong it don't depend on me it depend on him I'm depending on him so no matter how feeble how weak what my mind may say I want to stay on the word of God and confess the word of God no matter what Satan may tell against you you're not worthy oh yeah I'm not worthy but he said I was worthy and that's why I can shout [Music] hallelujah if God tells you you're worthy if God tells you I chose you before the foundation of the word it wants me make a shout hallelujah I want to have a victory dance because he paid the price he purchased you with a high price mhm and thank God he did let's continue my Hallelujah discrediting of God's word he knows that if the people now listen that's where we're going he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church there is a true church there is a true bride that is preparing for the Rapture that is soon going to take place hey don't play with time and I'm going to take this second Rapture there won't be a second Rapture you won't be able to take it there's only one Rapture and when the Rapture takes place the prophet says amen the Great Tribulation the Holy Ghost is taken and Great Tribulation comes on the earth woo people were wanting Desiring the Holy Ghost and it ain't there think of it of the privilege you have young and old brother sister man woman boy girl that God wants to give you more of the Holy Ghost this morning amen he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army there are soldiers that love to see you want brother Tim you go in front line I I'll hide behind you no God needs every one of you so if God puts you on the front line be the best you can in distress perplexed but not forgotten not abandoned come on Church no matter where God has positioned you be the best you can if God placed you here because even where you're seated God knew where you were going to sit this [Music] morning so God knows exactly what you need is but now are we willing to lay aside everything and say here am I fill my cup Lord so the Greater Works you will be an invincible Army be the best soldier for the Lord mhm I don't like to fight I'm not talking about fighting each other cuz that's what Satan wants to do in churches put this one against that one this one against that one and as long as that is going on he's just sitting and relaxing amen but I'm not talking about fighting each other I'm talking about fighting the same common enemy we have and that's the Antichrist Spirit that's Satan himself sir come on Amen because he says Satan will be powerless before this bride amen yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with the true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them that's why he says great is the mystery of godliness you know what godliness means to be like God I'm quoting the prophet 1 john: 15 says this then this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him there is no Darkness at all Psalm 27 says the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid come on preach with me now you're allowed to say amen amen oh yeah yeah because you're not saying amen for brother Tim for brother Timothy for Brother David you're saying Amen to God we are afraid to say amen and when we are on a volleyball court we can scream [Applause] Hey cuz you only got get him even the sisters yeah and and when God tells you how much he loves you thank you Jesus how precious you are in his sight thank you Lord you cannot say Amen oh amen I maybe I don't feel like it but amen I believe it Lord amen Proverbs 4:18 says but the path of the just is as The Shining Light that shineth more and more un the perfect day woo yes he promised us that in the evening time there would be light thank God for the light thank God for the light amen oh he says amen he says it's the word it's the word turn on the light turns on the mechanics and they become Dynamics wo that's why Darkness cannot comprehend the the light my it turns it into Dynamics Hallelujah so lay aside every weight every ISM every Creed that the Dynamics the Holy Spirit might flow through the word and vindicate the word that's promised this day this day this Sunday morning then the Great Church of God will rise to her feet like a jet propelled plane take off to disguise to meet her master that's how fast I want to answer God because you know Saints that's how fast God can come and meet with you some people have the idea that God is way far off some people believe that God is oh he's too far I've done too many mistakes I'm not worthy amen if you can only surrender and say God God I need you I want to have my personal victory dance in the open book M brother brandham says I'll have an Easter a resurrection for the bride the same as I had for the bridegroom who says see evening lights come out to shine same as the morning same sign same thing the same signs and wonders where did it start at Pentecost but he's still the same today amen he says that same light will produce the same fruit that they had there it's shining on the same tree and it proves his word now because he said I will restore amen it's still building up now stay with me don't tell me you're tired I have a jet Lake you don't so we know that we had four four messengers of death that killed that tree all right the palmerworm the Locust the cankerworm the caterpillar amen four messengers of Roman Devils dogmas killed that tree amen one took its tree one took its bark took its leaves took its by its life amen before messengers of dogmas killed that tree amen all but the roots and if four messengers of of death gild that tree four messengers of life restores the tree thank you Jesus that we are living under the eagle anointing this is the anointing that takes us out of here amen are you hearing me amen four Deb Messengers killed it but then four Messengers will restore it amen he quotes it Martin Luther justification John Wesley sanctification pancost restoration of the gifts amen the Holy Ghost baptism of Holy Ghost what was the fourth the word the [Applause] word amen in the last days Malachi 4 Elijah is to come with every word the word of the Lord came to the prophet in the evening lights is to come forth to restore and bring back what he says to turn the hearts of the children Hallelujah back to the faith of the fathers he says the fourth light woo Hallelujah the fort was the word itself the word made flesh come on now fruits of the proof of the Resurrection so now with the full restoration of the word comes the full restoration of the power right yes sir if that can drop deep in your soul Satan will be powerless before you before each and everyone that's right because if it drops in your soul it's not a head knowledge it's a reality you know that you know well no matter what Satan may tell you can show you scientific proof you know that the word of God will never fail amen he says what was that F that fourth light to shine the light on the word that's why I keep on saying we are a privileged people so many people are scratching their head they read the same Bible as we do and they don't have the Revelation the light on the word like we have it that's why brother brandham he says amen you know when he talks about the dream amen and he says amen we were all standing there together I'm just quoting it listening to you interpret the Mysteries writing on those stones on the mountain and he says then you picked up something like from the air you know that story something like a wrecking bar or a crowbar are you with me something like that A Wrecking Bar real sharp and said how you done it I don't know and you struck the top of that mountain and ripped it around and lifted the cap of it and it was in the shape of a pyramid and you ripped the top of it and beneath that was white stone white granite and you said the Sun the light has never shined on this before look on this look on this the open book he said that just before the opening of the seals does that mean that what he says before the seals you throw it away no by no means but that's what the third PLL is about the revealing of the word of God the light on the word so that us can be restored to the faith of the fathers hallelujah amen amen amen isn't that wonderful that's why you should never let the message become common you're not hearing me and when I told you in the beginning that you are a blessed people to have the ministry that you have that's not to lift up my friends no but you see what's going on in the world Satan tries to discredit the word of God by all mean whatever he can he will try to do it but solid preachers that's stand for the truth oh yes you can give glory to God Amen because it's a gift from God and it's God's blessing to you oh yeah it's God's blessing to [Music] you so he says amen who is this amen the spirit that was on our lord Jesus is coming to unite himself with his church he's spreading forth his great Holy Light to redeem and bring us into Fellowship the Church of the Living God for the Rapture that is near at hand amen then he says turn on the light don't refuse the light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ which brings the warming rays of the Holy Ghost upon you it makes you a new creation in Jesus Christ that's the way God does it today he sends his words for for this hour and the Holy Spirit comes and makes that word live but if you have a rebellious Spirit how do you want the word of God to manifest in your life right oh not me Brother David really are you sensitive to the voice of God where you don't want to miss anything that God wants to tell you right yeah it's not always in the big loud voice it's in the still Small Voice although it can be screamed from behind the pulpit but God is knocking that's right but if there's a rebellious spirit amen the word can have no effect unless you you come to Christ that's right run to Christ and while he still saves while he still fills while he still delivers while he still heals take every opportunity you can and give it all to Jesus hallelujah hallelujah amen amen amen and the Holy Spirit comes and make the word live amen but light shine because it's the word of God being Vindicated that his word is true and there's nothing fictitious about that you know you have to get out of this mess age to get into the message amen because you're in such a mess because you left the word of God but I've got good news he's still alive he's still the same this morning but are you willing to lay everything aside and run through Christ get into the message and it will take you out of your mess age are you with me when Jesus asked Peter who do you say not what everybody else says what do you say who do you say say that I am do you know that cuz we know the scripture the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against us do you know that when Jesus asked that it was in the area of of cesaria that was filled with immorality comparable like now there was a cave and on on the side of Mount Heron there was a cave that was consecrated to all kind of immorality debauchery evil evil things and that before you enter that gate the sorry that cave that's where they call the Gate of Hell so now here Jesus asked Peter before this these Gates of Hell then we can bring it now to our time we live it's hell on Earth but if all power of Satan don't forget that the power of God has been restored for God's people so he asked in front of the gate who do you say that I am not what brother Tim says no what brother Timothy brother Aaron brother Joe Brother David or whoever says what do you say who do you say that I [Applause] am and upon this Revelation before for the Gates of Hell immorality so we live in a world where there's Darkness but the light still shines bright and the darkers will not comprehend will not take over God's light God's word thou art Christ the son of the Living God and upon this Revelation this rock of asan Amen not a revelation that anybody will give you but that my father has given you this personal experience where God meets you individually I'm too young that's nonsense I'm too old that's nonsense if God used brother Branham to bring an old lady why would he even quote it yeah when he talks about the light I was in the study there and that came to my mind you know the story about a lady in Memphis yeah yeah her boy that do bad things that's right he did bad things but let me tell you the blood of Jesus still cleans the worst sinner the most violent sinner because that's the power of the blood That's The Power of my savior amen and went brother Brandon went you know why because there was somebody crying out sent me the god of Elijah are we willing to cry out for our son for our daughter for our wife for our husband for our uncle for our Aunt come on you name it are you willing to cry out I need Jesus while they were while she was crying out oh yes God made sure the prophet on the scene was there amen so he went he didn't even know think of it just like I don't know your situation Brother David are you putting yourself at brother brother br's level no I'm just putting positioning myself according to the word of God that I am a son of God and I've got all Heaven behind [Applause] me so here he comes doesn't even know where to go now turn left turn right I want to meet with somebody yeah come on how desperate are you this morning how desperate are you all no matter whether you sit in the front or in the back how desperate are you for God it has to be life it's a matter of life or death hallu and here she says hello Parson Hello Brother David I have a need okay why don't we pray and brother brand does it so that he knew she had a relationship with God that's how good God is he says why don't you pray she starts praying brother brandom joins in and this man he did bad things so did we all don't think you've when Beyond God's grace if God sent me here this morning to tell you that God's grace is sufficient for you no matter what happens no matter who abandons no matter what Satan will try to tell you you want to kill yourself no God has better plans for you you're not hearing me God has better plans for you and I'm sick and tired of these demons all these Demons of hell that try to B God's people because God's purpose for you is Liberty is to have a victory dance hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah while they started praying Glory the young man Hallelujah he wasn't praying but Mom brother Brandon prayed I can see light I can see light I pray this morning that you will see light in your life that you have a life transforming experience that's for all of you whoever desires you can have [Applause] it come on church that's for all of you Satan has put so much garbage on you yeah amen so much concrete but let me tell you there's still power in the Rays of the S so n to bring the seed to manifestation Glory so don't you worry only believe don't people some people think I'm crazy no some people think I'm out of myself hey I've got some nice bombs here in the word we'll get to it because Satan wants to get the power out of the church Satan wants to get the worship [Music] M you can sit in the Pew and worship Satan woo yes sir really oh yes yes come on oh yes because when you hear the word of God and you don't respond that makes you responsible before God Hallelujah hey Hallelujah but when you hear his voice amen oh just open up just respond amen and you will see the light in your life you will see the transforming power take place in your individual life no matter how young or old you are that's the power of the word that's the power of the light the light of God oh yes the darkness will not comprehend it that's right so who do you say that I am and that's upon this Revelation the prophet says what is it it's a revelation of God the spiritual revelation of God manifests himself to the individual Hallelujah and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the gates of hell righten even if all hell is against you that ought to make us jump you know why I quote it as the eagle stirred her nest because the prophet says you better trust God now for the jump because soon we'll take a jump a Rapture yeah and sometimes so he says he also quotes you better get let get rid of all your loose feathers all your things that are holding you know withholding you it keeps you bound you are not a true worshipper because oh I you believe the nonsense of Satan he starts saying you're not worthy don't say Amen cuz somebody would think you know you're out of yourself don't say glory be to God because you know nowadays it's not coming anymore let me remind you they were in one Accord one mind in the upper room you know what they did they were worshiping God they didn't even know they just got the promise not knowing what the Holy Spirit was but they worshiped God continually knowing that God always keeps his [Applause] promises can we do the same yes let the true worshippers arise amen he says what is it the revelation of God so you can fight the Holy Rollers as you call them all you want to but God's church will prevail go right on to the end of time yes sir it shows that the Gates of Hell will be against it but will not Prevail against it oh Church of the Living God Amen we serve a mighty God Amen so we know amen what brother brandham says the third pull is the opening of them seals amen Christ coming down with an open book that's why when you see your name in the book and that's an individual Affair between God and you isn't it something how many remember the birth you had the second yes anybody yes oh no no do you remember yes I do you the moment you came out of the womb and breath came into you nobody does but there was Mom and Dad come on that took pictures pictures that as you grew up that started talking about you see this picture here that's you David that's you come on Saints dad says hey I told you you come from God and I go back to God so the more the more you grow the more you see who you are are and that's nobody can tell if somebody comes tell me Jessica Meer you know Jessica Meer I'm glad she's here yes you know why because I was there when my wife gave birth and we took pictures and so on and we showed this is you you don't remember just like we didn't remember we were in God before the foundation of the word but God came down and opened up the book for me Hallelujah and he showed me my identity he showed me who I am and upon this Revelation the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it glory be to God glory be to God hallelujah hallelujah Glory and the best part is brother brandham says he took the picture of you at your best at your best when you were in him Hallelujah Satan tells you you're no good Satan tells you you can't make it Satan tells you you're a loser but let me give you your true identity God tells you you already made it Hallelujah Satan let me go back to the photo album the pictures that was taken of me I was in Christ Jesus amen I was rejoicing with Jesus when I saw the Plan of Redemption unfolding before me come on Saints that's where where I come from where you come from but unless you take it on and believe it it's like going to my daughter are you Jessica Mayer uh I don't know I'll tell her come here I'll straighten you out oh yeah because she has some character traits from me [Music] if you check her DNA come on now if you check her DNA you find that she comes from me come on now so go and tell Satan check my DNA I come from God get me behind me Satan Hallelujah that's why that's why excuse me that's why Moses could walk to Pharaoh he wasn't ashamed to tell him that he wouldn't compromise are you willing to stop compromising come on wouldn't St I wouldn't compromise on anything he said we not even leave a hoof behind woo talking about Authority that's why Christ came down with an open book to give us the authority amen that he gave us to what to really have a victory dance in the open book The revealed word yes let's continue amen not we even leave a ho behind why listen to what brother Ram says he came into the light of Deliverance sir that's here shining bright and clear this morning the light of Deliverance amen that's the reason a man or a woman sick or anything once he comes into the presence of God and knows that God has healed them you're stepping into the light of Deliverance and you don't compromise on anything that's right no matter how unreal it may seem no matter how impossible it may seem right let me tell you and I'm quoting the word all things are possible if you believe amen the Deliverance was in his heart he had met God who said I am the god of Abraham who gave the promise to Abraham amen and he's still the same God this morning amen we're talking about a victory dance what is Victory the Greek lexican says Nike the winning of a battle war or any struggle I'm not doing giving any publicity here huh make a little be clear just Greek Nike to overcome is nikio to conquer to carry off the victory to come off Victorious am I talking to a Victorious people here this morning in Zephaniah 3:17 it says the Lord thy God is in the midst of thee is mighty he will save he will rejoice over thee with joy he will rest in his love and he will Joy over ye with singing 1 Corinthians 15:57 but thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ 1 John 54 we it for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith let me quote you Revelation 12 and they overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony oh yes we need the blood of the lamb and thank God a perfect sa sacrifice amen was given for me and you but now what is your testimony this morning are are you willing to stand upon the word of God this morning and Believe In The [Applause] Impossible come on Saints we see many examples in the bible let me see it's still early we see many examples in the Bible of God's people dancing where are you going brother David nailing some demons dancing of God's people as a reaction to the goodness of God in their life that's why people can sit as dry sticks because they don't experience the goodness of God in their Liv but let me tell you this woman at the well and only if you drink of this water you will never thirst again that's right from a sinner she became a preacher woo Brother David where are you going she testified I'm not say I'm not saying that I'm going to straighten that run right out no women preachers but women brothers who testify she came at that well as a sinner thinking she wasn't Worthy but she met Jesus and when testifying the Messiah is here now there were religious people and they were blinded just like today people are blinded but thank God there is a bride preparing that sees a light of God Amen that sees the open book and goes to the Angel takes the open book and eat the book to become the book to become the word hallelujah amen so we see Miriam in Exodus 15 when they went through the Red Sea Miriam she sang the song of Deliverance you want to talk about Deliverance before we see also in the Bible just quote that one before that David danced with all his might when the Ark of the Covenant came back the Psalm 30 says Thou Hast turned for me my mour into dancing thou Hast put off my sackcloth and GED me with gladness to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee and not be silent oh Lord my God I will give thanks unto thee forever how many can say I will give thanks to my Lord forever in the good times I will praise him in the bad times I will do the same so dancing is a natural expression even brother Bram says even the type of music put it next to a baby and you see how he will react so it's a natural thing okay just building up here and when you're filled with the fullness of God oh something has to express itself amen oh John 8:36 says he who the sun sets free is free indeed let me quote you that I know I'm not an English teacher sorry brother Aaron no no but you're better in English than me is free in space deed okay let me talk to you a little while about the deed is that okay yeah so what is the book of redemption the title deed the exra abstract title D it means it search all the way back to its beginning come on now you become a Son of God it's Redemption means all legal possession to all that was lost by Adam and Eve oh my brother blam claps his hands together once oh sorry once but I'm going to clap oh yes he's worthy of my praise amen now listen I'm talking to you now what ought that to do to a born again Christian amen let's continue he says what did he do by for knowledge he forsaw us knowing that he was a savior the self self-existent one by full knowledge he looked down and he saw everyone that could accept it and then by doing so he said to say that the only way I can do it is I will become down myself made flesh and take the sin of man upon him and die for him that I might be the one that's worshiped God deserves all the glory even when you don't feel like it he is still watching over you and he deserves all the [Music] glory so in plain language the bre the true bright was in the mind of God eternally amen I'm talking about your photo album huh we did not become seed by rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be [Music] reborn God put your name on the land's book of life before the world was even formed you want to talk about a victory dance some people think I'm born and hey and now I I have this poor life no no no the best thing God could do as we bypassed our theophany he says he Place us here to be tested and tempted why because God wants to show forth his glory through you and if you only can believe and confess his word you will see Miracles you will see Giants fall you will walk on water you will see the glory of God revealed manifested through you hallelujah amen amen that's why when John listen now when John he says talking about a happy time when the seals broke amen he must have looked and seen his name look past the curtain of time that's why the word is being preached to you this morning so you can by faith receive your true identity and see who you are because that's Satan wants you to believe that you're powerless but when the true church the bride oh believes and takes the open book Satan is powerless against her how many are part of that her oh yeah let it be me Let It Be Me Lord amen now amen when we eat the book we become the book and Jeremiah 15 says thy words were found and I did eat them and the word Thy Word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of my heart for I am called by thy name oh Lord God of Hosto I'm not going to call you church anymore Miss Jesus Christ and the title deed belongs to you you're not hearing me the ti deed belongs to you that's why you can really have a victory dance because when that becomes a reality you know that Satan is under your foot right hallelujah amen so we see that Miriam she sang amen we see that Exodus 15 amen oh do you know what just before Exodus 14 they the children of Israel went out you know why hi how sorry with a high handl that's what we ought to do sometimes High hands you know when you raise your hands you know what you do you defy gravitation gravity are you with me but Satan wants to keep you bound like this start worshiping God give him thanks for his goodness give him thanks for his grace when you start looking into the word of God and you see the promises laying there before you it's about time you take a step of Faith it's about time Footprints means possession you take possession of what God has already given you the title deed Belongs to [Music] You hallelujah amen with high hand Amen in Exodus 15 I will sing unto the Lord for he had triumphed gloriously how many are identified with that word the Lord is my strength and song and he has become my salvation he is my God and I will prepare him in habitation my father's God woo my father is God and I will exalt him verse six thy right hand oh Lord is become glorious in power thy right hand oh Lord had dashed in pieces the enemy that wasn't just for Moses that's right and the people leaving Egypt that's the same for us now listen and with the blast of thy nostrils woo what a mighty God we serve the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together the flood stood upright as a heap and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea that's why the wind of Pentecost still blows this morning amen amen the wind of Pentecost the same blast of the nostrils think about it he didn't even just out of the nostrils my going somewhere oh yeah Satan has to be under your foot because the moment you believe it's not what you can do it's what God has already done for you amen amen I will overtake I will divide the SPO my L shall be satisi satisfied upon them amen and I will draw my sword my hand shall destroy them verse 10 thou this blow with thy wind the sea covered them they sank as lad the mighty Waters wow this this mightiest Army sank as lead who is like unto thee or Lord among the gods who is like thee glorious in Holiness fearful and praise doing wonders verse 13 thou in thy mercy has led for the people which thou has redeemed thou has guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation the Lord shall reign in verse 18 forever and ever talking about a song of Praise talking about a shout of Victory Exodus 15 talks about the song of Moses and we see also in Revelation 15 they sang the song of Moses and the song of the Lamb so there is something about singing giving glory to God not just you want to hear my my nice vocal cords no no I can sing as as bad as it could be but it when it is with a pure heart with a sincere heart that's what God loves so then let Satan oh you don't your voice is not good enough oh yes God Gave You vocal cords to praise him and even if you can play an instrument God gave you two hands amen that's why I praise him because he's worthy of all my praise amen let's go on for a little while amen so Miriam amen when she crossed over he says how beautiful that types our church today and how that they crossed through the Red Sea and then Moses began to sing in the spirit Spirit Miriam picked up the tambourine began to dance just like an oldfashioned Holy Ghost meeting dancing in the spirit give me that old time religion give me that old time time religion amen are you with me give me that old time religion it's good enough for me it was good for brother Bram it was good for brother Bram it was good for brother Bram and it's sure good enough for me come on Saints we can rejoice in the house of God you know why because the spirit of God is moving and there where the spirit of the Lord is there is [Music] Liberty Hallelujah that's a holy ghost meeting dancing and singing and here brother Tim we get busted criticized because we're too Pentecostal I'll tell you what the prophet says well get go go there go there dancing and singing and praising the Lord why why were they dancing why were they praising they had the [Applause] victory they got the victory amen amen and we see amen even David we quoted him he danced in the spirit we know David was a Shepherd amen oh and the old Shepherd says a Prophet amen they used to carry a script bag that's the best gun you can have not the big long rifle AK-47s no no that's way powerful it's stronger than the atomic weapon that's what the prophet says he had a script bag and every time he need it listen he says brother branam amen he had a scrip bag amen and every time there was a sheep who would get sick they take the honey and pour it on the Rock and let the sick sheep go and lick to that rock when they lick the rock of the honey they got oh the got some of the Limestone out of the Rock and it healed the Sheep now let me bring it to you look Brothers I got a whole script back full of Honey now I'm going to put it on the rock called Jesus Christ and you sick sheep get to licking right quick and see if you ain't didn't get well yes sir lick with all you [Applause] can just go Brother David what are you telling lick that eat the little book amen you just eat that word so you become that word there is power in the word amen there's power in that light amen and the Darkness will never comprehend it so we can Rejoice because we have Victory in Jesus so many people they have forgotten the name of Jesus and they have forgotten the power in the name of Jesus uhhuh but there's only one name that SA that Jesus Christ there's only one name that cast down demons that's in the name of Jesus let me tell you there's power in that name you want a testimony brother John he experienced the name of Jesus he was dead in the belly and here Mary comes comes oh in the name of Jesus he he heaped for Joy says the Bible life came to him because in the name of Jesus ye have life everlasting life so just test it try it and you'll see it the problem is so many people don't want to try it anymore m mhm few more minutes is that okay we see David isn't it something how David just like Jesus just like brother Bram had three poles The Lion The Bear Goliad for Goliath he spoke the word Goliath boasted I'll feed you to the foul of it who do you think you are is that the strongest one you send me you know that's how Satan talks to us come on you can do it did you see you sister you're so small your brother what he fails to see is who is inside of you so here David hears the boast and how does he reply here I am depending on my strength no here I am I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts and he will deliver me into my hands why so that all the Earth may know that there is a God even today for each and everyone let's not miss Every Blessing we can get we come to church and we go back and we oh well it was good no it can be better than just oh we had a good service you can be refilled you can be changed maybe some of you lost the joy of your salvation but God can restore it to you you're not you haven't lost your salvation you lost your joy but God restores Joy God restores strength God restores [Applause] Health it shows that no weapon that is formed against thee do you know when you look in the Bible and I go I won't go into that but only the spare Spear of of Goliath was like a toothpick for David I mean he could have just put him on or like a barbecue stick or something like that David was you get what I'm I'm trying to say but David didn't go he went in the name the Lord God Almighty and he says the Bible talks of how David when he went do you know how Satan sorry how Goliath how he fell down anybody knows I know thank you David faces Goliath and we're going to read I'm going to read a quote before because it's important brother brah says here comes Little David just bouncing in the spirit have you ever seen sorry I'm really feeling at home have you ever seen somebody bouncing in the spirit Amen brother Tim come on preach it amen that's a demon of tiredness coming upon you you want to fight your goliaths like that hey we're in the army of the Lord I got your attention now good but we all have our role to play so here comes David dancing in the spirit that's why we have to be true worshippers that's worship Him in spirit and in truth some people go through the emotion first you have to get into the spirit right we don't want just an emotion it has to be a reality true worship and it doesn't come from the head it comes from the heart amen so here comes Little David just bouncing in the spirit ha ha ha wo oh what a Holy Roller Victory already my if we could come to church like that brother Tim wouldn't what a meeting we would have we go through these doors haa I'm going to be filled haa I'm going to be healed Satan watch it hey that's David right a man after God's Own Heart yes wouldn't you want to be one after God's Own Heart okay that's the recipe Victory already Hallelujah why he placed the name of the Lord God of Israel before him and all the devils in Hell couldn't wait across that little David just dancing in the spirits dancing in the spirit when you dance in the spirit you lose control over everything brother Bram says when the Holy Spirit starts moving I've never seen anything disorderly but there's so many there's this Antichrist spirit that wants to take the glory out of the church and makes it lukewarm make it formal dead but let me tell you amen God is still alive and there are true worshippers today give him glory to God and they are not ashamed they're not ashamed to give glory to God they can call me a fanatic they can call me a Holy Roller but God calls me a man after his own heart hallelujah amen amen oh you say David dancing oh yeah he was a dancer so I took an example of Miriam a sister and David a brother all right oh we see the sisters dancing the spirits but us Brothers you know we're man okay let's talk men to man God wants to see your worship you get in the spirit Lose Yourself where I quoted in the beginning where you're in Heavenly places and you know that all things are possible that's why David could dance in the spirit he says Victory already amen oh God looked down out of heaven and said David you're a man after my own heart hahaa Oh Glory you're the very man after my own heart and little old David was a dancer and he went up there just dancing in the spirit as hard as he could wo because by faith he saw the victory that's right Goliath you've got to oh and some people of you you think oh it ain't the Goliath it's just a little thing God inspired brother Tim before even the word was preached everything lay it aside and fill my cup Lord that's what matters right now in this in this service by faith he saw the victory Goliath you've got to fall and you listen now when he set that loose the Holy Ghost got a hold of that little Old Stone and picked up speed you know what speed about 1,000 miles per second oh yeah it's wor of a woo hallelujah what a mighty God I serve we serve 1,000 miles per second my Putin would love to have that kind of weapon even the American Army but now Saints that's the power that you have that's the power that you have and look to the power of God if you have something going a th000 miles per second believe me when you get shot are you okay you're all Hunters no I'm not demon Hunter yes but you fall backwards isn't that right Goliath you can read it he fell forwards and do you know why very simple because every knee will bow at the name of Jesus and here in these meetings let me warn notice to Satan wherever you are whoever you're in trying to keep hold keep down keep bolted down like brother brandham says they are bolted to the chairs instead of going amen creating an atmosphere where you start feeling your Liberty you start seeing Oh there's the promise in the book and it's mine so you start worshiping oh yes I'm Healed I'm delivered I've been set free every demon must bow down to the name of Jesus hallelujah amen amen [Music] amen now of everything that God has I'm almost done the devil has a counterfeit that's why people come and oh no dancing in church really you find like these old dances that's of the devil but God has a holy dance for the people the Bible said so and I was one of the greatest Critics on that you ever seen till God told me just what to do and I found that that Miriam have you ever seen till God yeah Miriam danced in the spirit danced David danced when he had the victory because there's a holy dance H listen to Martha I'm winding up now Martha finds her in a situation where Lazarus he's dead Jesus comes oh if only he would have been here Lazarus would still be alive but listen I love her response and I pray that is our response no matter how bad your situation may look how impossible your situation may look Martha said so even though several days passed but even now I know I am the resurrection and life so even now you may have been struggling for years you may have been battling all kinds of demon spirits of Oppression depression suicide temptation drugs now's your moment this is your moment amen this is the moment that God ordained for us so no matter how long listen to what habac says and that's for each and every one who has received the word of God for division is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it t wait for it because it will surely come so don't give up Saints don't give up hold on to the promise it's yours you just start giving Glory now why was David dancing listen he saw the victory Miriam saw the victory listen to what brother Bram says we maybe if the musicians can come we can stand to our feet I'm winding up brother Brown finds himself in a meeting and they're singing there's going to be a meeting in the air and he says I never believed in them people that danced you know the quote mhm I never did believe in them people dancing the way they did and there was a little lady came to play the piano maybe if you can play there is power in the name of Jesus softly please he says lady came to play the piano I was very much a Critic of it and this little blond-headed girl jumped out of there on the floor and began to dance in the spirits and me sitting in the seat of the scornful that's where many people are brother God bless you for preaching the [Music] word and I had been telling my church till they was all wondering what I was going to do about it think of it what is brother Tim going to do all [Music] focusing they're making look to the words what he's saying they're making a Tavern out of my church those are no little words and the first thing you know I said wait a minute I wonder if the lady has got any scripture for that and I begin to think about the scripture where was dancing ordained at you notice the word ordained yes take that Satan in your teeth God has a holy dance for his people and it was ordained by God himself where was dancing ever ordained that the first place in the Bible that's right he says what made them dance I seen the children of Israel when they crossed the Red Sea mirion look back and see all the task master drown when you see your demons under your feet when you see your change falling back oh yes you're going to have a holy dance I don't care how it is as long as you're in the spirit worshiping God hallelujah she picked up the tambourine begin to dance beat his tambourine run down the shores dancing and the daughters of Israel followed her all dancing I thought he says that's Victory when David seen it coming when the ark came he danced around and around and around why mik said you embarrass me think think of it you're in the message you're in a message you shouldn't praise you shouldn't worship you shouldn't dance when God inhabits the praise of his people there there should be such a true [Music] worship when you see your name in the book you can have a victory dance this morning in the open book When God reveals to you you don't have to be a slave any longer you don't have to live in sin any longer I paid the price for your Liberty I pay the price for each and every sin and my blood oh washes The viest Sinner clean and I'm not ashamed if I Am The viest Sinner that's Satan again trying to play with your mind cuz his blood has never lost its [Music] power let me wind up so here comes his wife says you made a fool of yourself you marass me well I love David's reply if you don't like that well watch this that's right if you don't like my dancing my holy dance because I have the victory in Jesus there is power in the name of Jesus to break every chain oh yes watch this Hallelujah let me give a testimony before closing when we were in maius Islands sister Jessica start before I came up to preach she sang the song I speak Jesus the power of God came down in such a way just like the Bible says I couldn't even preach and under the inspiration just exhorting just encouraging God's people all of a sudden I take a hold of one of the ministers quoting Jose uh sorry Joshua [Music] Joshua seven Church ages going around but the seventh there was a shout the shout of the king is in the camp and I took come on brother Joe you were with me not knowing under God's inspiration I started walking hallah around the building the tent sorry not knowing I'm going to continue brothers and sisters we're all following because the power of God hey walk around your walls you think I'm making a fool of myself no I'm not I'm talking I'm speaking against these walls all these strongholds they have to come down in Jesus name they started running they started praising they started giving glory to God they were delivered they were filled they were healed that's the God we serve that's the God we serve this morning there's power in the name of Jesus try it try it and he will open the flood gates of Heaven Hallelujah you know what brother brandham says I don't like that but watch [Music] this you know what brother brandham realized he says I thought you know there's one thing matter with [Music] me Hallelujah critics you can hear it loud there's something wrong with you if you don't want to worship true worship he says there's something wrong with me the matter with me I haven't got enough Victory so if you start praising start having your victory dance in the open book you know all things are possible oh yes because in Jesus name every demon has to flee try it now is your timeall don't waste your time don't waste it for another service there might not be another service Brother David you've said that before I'm going to say it again there might not be another service God knows what tomorrow hold yes but now by Grace you have an opportunity if you see the victory somebody that's depressed somebody that is oppressed somebody that has suicide feelings somebody that has trouble in his life somebody who's Desiring a baby somebody's Desiring any Redemptive promise when you can see the Victory and you start worshiping God you start giving glory to God thank God for my healing thank God for my Deliverance thank God for every promise in the book that is mine you will see you will have a victory dance yes not an emotional reality and that's what God desires for each and every one of you amen so take your Victory BR says I haven't got enough Victory and you know how he ended up he was in the seat of the scornful I'm pointing there when the sister was dancing in the spirit and then he realized I haven't gotten a victory my feet started Hallelujah I've got the victory in Jesus and all of a sudden he find himself dancing cuz God has a holy dance for each and every one of you I may not know your situation that's why I'm coming to you because that's what God is telling you tonight you have a holy dance if you start claiming it yes it's yours oh if the vision carries just hold on God gave you the promise another man God gave you the promise talking about the victory you want to talk about worship when Miriam took the tambourine all the sisters followed her come on have you ever heard a shout of Praise where all the millions all the little ones the big ones started praising the strongest army the demons that were holding you you don't see them any longer [Music] Hallelujah Glory
