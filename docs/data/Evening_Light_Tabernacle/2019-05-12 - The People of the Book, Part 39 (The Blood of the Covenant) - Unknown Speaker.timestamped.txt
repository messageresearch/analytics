[44:42] last night is our sister comes last
[44:44] night I was I was up pretty late it's
[44:47] hard to get back on this schedule at the
[44:49] time you're supposed to be going to beds
[44:51] at time you're waking up and the
[44:53] evenings you get wide awake so about
[44:56] 12:30 1:00 o'clock seeing that Japan was
[44:58] having church this morning and I joined
[45:00] in with them for a moment you know and
[45:03] they just have what they do with
[45:05] everything everything they have they
[45:06] just don't have very many musicians

[45:33] in the Philippines you know we have seen
[45:34] we gathered there with 400 or more young
[45:38] people about 500 people I believe all
[45:40] together and you know I looked around
[45:43] and I thought you know one day the
[45:45] Philippines didn't have the message
[45:47] there wouldn't know anybody just like
[45:50] Japan there was just very few and then
[45:52] now today is 400 and sometimes up to 700
[45:55] kids when they can have it on Easter
[45:57] weekend 700 kids that are gathered
[45:59] together that believe this message amen
[46:02] and you know that one little Japanese
[46:04] young person got to go over there and
[46:06] take part of that our world was changed
[46:09] to better see the other young people
[46:11] love the Lord and serve God young people
[46:13] you got a lot to be thankful for amen
[46:16] and now amen we just want to just
[46:18] remember them and I know we'll probably

[1:07:45] hebrews chapter 13 verse 20 now the God

[1:08:14] ever amen amen
[1:08:18] turn with me to Exodus chapter 12 and
[1:08:20] verse three as we look here having read
[1:08:25] about the blood of the everlasting
[1:08:26] covenant and that's what we'll be
[1:08:28] speaking on today the blood of the
[1:08:30] Covenant we look here in Exodus chapter
[1:08:33] 12 and we'll read from the third verse
[1:08:37] was a very serious time in Israel they
[1:08:41] were leaving Egypt going to a promised
[1:08:44] land we are also in an exodus hour amen
[1:08:48] this is a very serious hour that we're
[1:08:50] in it's a time that we really make a
[1:08:54] call in an election sure we know where
[1:08:57] we stand in this hour Exodus chapter 12
[1:09:00] and verse 3 speaking to all this
[1:09:03] congregation of Israel saying in the
[1:09:06] tenth day of this month they shall take
[1:09:08] to them every man a lamb according to
[1:09:11] the house of their fathers a lamb for a
[1:09:14] house and if a household be too little
[1:09:17] for the lamb let him and his neighbor
[1:09:20] neck
[1:09:21] unto his house take it according to the
[1:09:23] number of the souls every man according
[1:09:26] to his eating shall make your count for
[1:09:30] the lamb your lamb shall be without
[1:09:32] blemish a male of the first year and you
[1:09:36] shall take it out from the sheep or from
[1:09:39] the goats and ye shall keep it up until
[1:09:43] the fourteenth day of the same month and
[1:09:45] the whole Assembly of the congregation
[1:09:47] shall kill it in the evening and they
[1:09:51] shall take of the blood and strike it on
[1:09:53] the two side post and on the upper
[1:09:57] doorpost of the houses wherein they
[1:09:59] shall eat it and they shall eat the
[1:10:01] flesh in that night roast with fire and
[1:10:05] unleavened bread and with bitter herbs
[1:10:09] shall they they shall eat it eat not of
[1:10:12] it raw nor sodden at all with water but
[1:10:15] roast with fire his head with his legs
[1:10:19] with the pertinence thereof and ye shall
[1:10:22] let none of it remain until the morning
[1:10:25] and that which remaineth of it until the
[1:10:28] morning you shall burn with fire and
[1:10:31] thus shall you eat it with your loins
[1:10:34] girded your shoes on your feet and your
[1:10:37] staff in your hand and you shall eat it
[1:10:40] in haste for it is the Lord's Passover
[1:10:43] for I will pass through the land of
[1:10:46] Egypt this night and will smite all the
[1:10:48] firstborn in the land of Egypt both man
[1:10:51] and beast and against all the gods of
[1:10:54] Egypt I will execute judgment I am the
[1:10:58] Lord and the blood shall be to you for a
[1:11:01] token upon the houses where you are and
[1:11:04] when I see the Blood I will pass over
[1:11:07] you and the plague shall not be upon you
[1:11:10] to destroy you when I smite the land of
[1:11:14] Egypt Amen may God bless you can be
[1:11:17] seated as I said this morning we're
[1:11:20] going to be speaking on the blood of the
[1:11:23] Covenant as we look here in our opening
[1:11:28] scenes of our scripture we can see where
[1:11:31] that death was striking each
[1:11:34] and God was going to kill all the
[1:11:39] firstborn of all the Egyptians whether
[1:11:41] it was man or beast that there would be
[1:11:44] death there in the camps of the
[1:11:47] Egyptians there had been great plagues
[1:11:50] that were already had fallen and you
[1:11:54] know what boils had broke out fire was
[1:11:57] falling the rains that come the hail had
[1:11:59] come but God provided a place for his
[1:12:04] elect not to have to be a part of that a
[1:12:07] man he had a place called Goshen and and
[1:12:11] of course there was now a spirit of
[1:12:13] death that was coming upon the land and
[1:12:16] remember you know that's something that
[1:12:18] we must always realize that we are here
[1:12:21] in a very similar hour where death is
[1:12:25] striking the land and Israel would have
[1:12:27] to have something to keep them from
[1:12:29] dying that they you know they because of
[1:12:35] the sin death would strike them too and
[1:12:39] the wages of sin is death and Israel had
[1:12:42] sinned just like the Egyptians had
[1:12:44] sinned as we read quote the scripture
[1:12:47] all is sinned and fallen short of the
[1:12:50] glory of God and so so God so that they
[1:12:54] would not die his people who were trying
[1:12:58] to follow him he provided for them a
[1:13:00] lamb and a blood of the door that would
[1:13:04] protect their firstborn and of course
[1:13:07] that was God's provided way and that
[1:13:10] that there was a blood that would atone
[1:13:12] to keep the death angel from coming in
[1:13:16] and destroy and bring her death into the
[1:13:18] home now I want to quote brother Branham
[1:13:21] and saying this that any religion today
[1:13:23] that hasn't got the blood life for Jesus
[1:13:26] Christ behind it the death angel is on
[1:13:29] it and man the death angel separated
[1:13:33] from God yes indeedy Ichabod is rowed
[1:13:36] over every bit of it that hasn't got the
[1:13:38] bud and if you come under what that is
[1:13:40] that was when a child was named in
[1:13:43] Israel because of a great
[1:13:45] that was there in the time of Eli and
[1:13:49] the child as though the parents the Eli
[1:13:52] have died and and the father had died of
[1:13:55] this child the mother named the child if
[1:13:58] the Bob meaning the glory of the Lord
[1:14:01] has been taken or removed from us and so
[1:14:05] I it has departed so again that the
[1:14:09] Ichabod is rode on every bit of it he
[1:14:12] said in other words the glory of the
[1:14:15] Lord has departed and we we can see the
[1:14:20] effects in the world that we're living
[1:14:23] in because of the departing of the glory
[1:14:26] of God as sin increases as wickedness
[1:14:31] increases upon the world that we live in
[1:14:34] that we know that is because that
[1:14:36] ichabod is written over I religious
[1:14:40] systems even our governments in the land
[1:14:43] and ever even our families that the
[1:14:47] glory of the Lord is to party we see the
[1:14:51] holy spirit is lifting from the age that
[1:14:53] we're living in and you say well I'm
[1:14:56] glad the blood he said if the blood
[1:14:59] hasn't taken effect if it hasn't taken
[1:15:02] effect and you see it in your life you
[1:15:06] know many people claim it and so I'm
[1:15:09] under the blood I made a profession of
[1:15:11] faith I joined the church but if you
[1:15:13] don't see it in your life it hasn't been
[1:15:16] applied to you hey man so you might even
[1:15:20] have something else beside the blood you
[1:15:22] might have a injection of theology or
[1:15:25] injection of sudden sensation or you say
[1:15:28] I quivered I shook I danced I've done
[1:15:30] this he said be careful if the medicine
[1:15:33] ever strikes you it's good for every
[1:15:36] human being it man it will say from sin
[1:15:39] it is it in or clean up from a life of
[1:15:43] sin it'll make a different person out of
[1:15:46] you it'll take the doubt away amen
[1:15:50] you're a new creation in Christ a man
[1:15:53] it'll make a different person out of you
[1:15:56] a man and there with death struck evil
[1:15:59] Egypt our God separated a belief from
[1:16:02] unbelief and that's what he's doing
[1:16:05] today by the same blood of the Lamb now
[1:16:09] for the Israelites was leave in the
[1:16:12] Egypt was a type of this in time because
[1:16:15] this is an exodus also there's death in
[1:16:18] the lamb and let me just say today there
[1:16:22] is death in the lamb as I wrote read to
[1:16:26] you Wednesday night about the statistics
[1:16:29] of Christians who are who are actively
[1:16:33] seeking out porn and eighty percent and
[1:16:36] seventy percent fifty percent you don't
[1:16:39] do it depending on the age groups were
[1:16:42] that they're feeding on every kind of
[1:16:44] devilish thing that there is and here it
[1:16:48] is destroying that their lives is
[1:16:50] destroying their homes it's destroying
[1:16:53] marriages and then we have today people
[1:16:57] that are dying children that are dying
[1:16:59] marriages that are dying homes that are
[1:17:03] dying and sexes are dying demons like
[1:17:10] vultures flying around circling around
[1:17:12] looking for a place to lamb and I'll
[1:17:15] tell you what he'll find a place to land
[1:17:17] on you if there's no blood there hey
[1:17:23] ma'am I I really I quoted you Wednesday
[1:17:26] night about but the brannamon where he
[1:17:29] cast a demon out of Nellie Sanders and
[1:17:32] he said that demon rose up from her and
[1:17:36] there were see it you know where were
[1:17:38] they they come up on her now remember
[1:17:40] she was a repentant person she had a
[1:17:43] sweet peace that he come owner she had
[1:17:46] acts of salvation that had happened to
[1:17:49] her but she didn't go all the way she
[1:17:52] didn't get sealed to the day of
[1:17:54] redemption
[1:17:55] and so here a spirit took her in a
[1:17:58] moment of weakness let me tell you
[1:18:02] you're not strong enough to keep the
[1:18:04] devil out you're not powerful enough to
[1:18:07] hold him at bay there's only one thing
[1:18:10] that will hold him at bay and that's the
[1:18:12] bud are you in me now it's really
[1:18:15] important that we understand that even
[1:18:18] brother Brennan said that that demon
[1:18:20] rose up out of that woman and he said
[1:18:23] come out like a bat but black wings and
[1:18:25] hair hanging off of it
[1:18:27] oh no and his feet long hair coming down
[1:18:29] off its wings and feet and flew at him
[1:18:32] and he said them with the blood of jesus
[1:18:35] protect me from that you see even the
[1:18:38] prominent God was not safe outside of
[1:18:41] the blood and I don't care how good you
[1:18:44] are how religious you are how right you
[1:18:47] are in your doctrine how much you
[1:18:50] believe the message how straight to
[1:18:53] cross the t's and dot your i's if the
[1:18:56] blood ink there the towns of hell are on
[1:18:59] the way you're vulnerable amen now
[1:19:06] there's deaths in the light and the
[1:19:09] blood was a token if you notice he said
[1:19:12] the blood was me a token that's not
[1:19:14] simply a hard word for you to understand
[1:19:16] token is a sign it's a sign that there
[1:19:20] was a death already in that home that
[1:19:23] the blood of the lamb had atoned for
[1:19:25] that sin and the token was a sign on the
[1:19:30] door post that told the death angel
[1:19:33] keep out keep you can't come in here
[1:19:40] because why the blood is that because
[1:19:45] the blood was shed on my account
[1:19:49] and I've accepted that blood and I've
[1:19:52] applied that blood and because of that
[1:19:55] the death angel cannot enter in it's
[1:19:58] really important that we understand what
[1:20:01] the token is the token is today the
[1:20:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost now so the
[1:20:07] blood was a token or identification
[1:20:10] identifying this person had been
[1:20:13] redeemed
[1:20:14] notice that were redeemed before
[1:20:17] anything had happened by faith they
[1:20:20] applied the blood before it actually
[1:20:22] happened the blood was applied by faith
[1:20:26] believing that it was going to happen
[1:20:28] before that wrath of God pass through
[1:20:31] the lamb the blood had to be applied
[1:20:33] first it was too late after the blood
[1:20:37] after after the it was too late after
[1:20:41] the rat had already fallen we we have a
[1:20:44] lesson here that we could really maybe
[1:20:46] bring to your thought just a moment look
[1:20:49] before it happens before there's coming
[1:20:51] a time that you'll not be able to have
[1:20:54] any blood applied right now's the time
[1:20:57] to apply that blood hey man you know I'd
[1:21:03] like to look at the Scriptures for a
[1:21:04] moment because it's going to come to
[1:21:06] this every one of you will come to this
[1:21:09] place there is a line that is being
[1:21:11] drawn and we're getting closer to the
[1:21:13] edge and one day we will cross this over
[1:21:16] this line of this krypter right here
[1:21:19] Revelation chapter 22 and verse 11 I
[1:21:22] want you to look at this with me he that
[1:21:25] is unjust let him be unjust steal and he
[1:21:30] that is filthy let it be filthy still he
[1:21:34] that is righteous let it be right to
[1:21:37] steal he that is holy let him be holy
[1:21:40] still
[1:21:41] and behold I come quickly and my reward
[1:21:43] is with me to give every man according
[1:21:46] as his work might be shall be now notice
[1:21:50] as we're looking at this this is a line
[1:21:53] any man we're coming right down
[1:21:56] true this this is why we're trying to
[1:21:58] get ever so saved so that Jesus can come
[1:22:03] because this is at the moment of his
[1:22:05] coming because the next thing I'm behold
[1:22:07] I come quickly so you see this is event
[1:22:10] as he comes as he comes as and he
[1:22:14] appears and he takes his bride those are
[1:22:17] the righteous there will be rocks a
[1:22:19] stinger those that are holy will be holy
[1:22:22] steel but those come on the other side
[1:22:25] if they're filthy an immoral they'll
[1:22:28] still be filthy and immoral hey mom
[1:22:32] you're gonna be left in that condition
[1:22:34] what in there in that serious situation
[1:22:39] this is nothing to play with
[1:22:42] this is where that we realize any moment
[1:22:45] any moment any moment listen I want to
[1:22:48] just bear it to you we're over time
[1:22:51] we're in the last of the last of the
[1:22:53] last age hey man we're at the finish
[1:22:56] line we're already over time you don't
[1:22:59] have another moment to spare hey ma'am
[1:23:03] I'll tell you can't get in soon enough
[1:23:07] hey man we're trying to get ever so
[1:23:09] saved so that Jesus can come he cannot
[1:23:12] come until that last one that has the
[1:23:15] name on the book of life that was put
[1:23:17] there before the foundational world and
[1:23:19] when that name is called then that's the
[1:23:22] last one then he came to redeem to bring
[1:23:25] back redeem means to bring back and and
[1:23:28] when he brings the last one in he's
[1:23:31] sitting at the right hand of God
[1:23:33] gloating brother right now tonight doing
[1:23:36] his Mediterra work and when that last
[1:23:39] soul is saved that that was redeemed and
[1:23:42] seen and knew by God before the
[1:23:44] foundation world when that last soul is
[1:23:47] saved that closes the book
[1:23:50] and then the lamb comes and takes the
[1:23:53] book out of the right hand of him that
[1:23:55] sets up on the throne he's coming then
[1:23:57] he's coming to the earth
[1:23:59] hey ma'am now I would like to share this
[1:24:05] another little quotation from the
[1:24:06] Philadelphia Age because this was a 68
[1:24:10] in the eyes of God time is drawing to a
[1:24:14] close he will soon be coming back soon
[1:24:19] the cry will go forth as he comes and he
[1:24:23] that is filthy let him be filthy still
[1:24:25] he that is righteous let him be
[1:24:28] righteous stealing him that is holy let
[1:24:31] him be holy still
[1:24:32] soon the cry of the poor what I read to
[1:24:38] you is a cry that will actually go forth
[1:24:41] and when it does there's no more going
[1:24:45] to be saved
[1:24:46] not another Gentile saved you better get
[1:24:50] to the blood now Amen because this is
[1:24:54] the last warning let me tell you there
[1:24:55] will not be another just in case you
[1:24:58] don't know it we're in the last church
[1:25:00] age we're in the last days little
[1:25:03] children a man there will not be another
[1:25:05] age after this already the throne room
[1:25:08] is set up the twelve foundations have
[1:25:11] been laid the streets of gold have been
[1:25:13] paid I'm talking about God's ready to
[1:25:16] take the people home and then the gates
[1:25:19] of gigantic pearls are raised and Hinson
[1:25:21] like a pyramid ceased and so fair and
[1:25:24] glorious the heavenly beings who who
[1:25:26] have prepared her watch breathlessly
[1:25:28] glistens and shines with the glory
[1:25:31] that is an earthy every facet of her

[1:26:29] and once more God will reveal the truth
[1:26:31] as he did the Paul how many believes
[1:26:33] that a man in the days of the seven
[1:26:37] messenger in the days of the Laodicean
[1:26:39] age the messenger will reveal the
[1:26:42] mysteries of God as revealed the PAS hey
[1:26:46] ma'am and he will speak out and those
[1:26:50] who receive that prophet in his own name
[1:26:52] will receive the benefit effect of that
[1:26:56] prophets ministry man and David hear him

[1:27:04] how many feels blessed this morning you
[1:27:07] are a blessed people and become part of
[1:27:09] that bride of the last day who were
[1:27:11] mentioned in revelation 22 70 the spirit
[1:27:15] and the bride say come
[1:27:17] hey man I've heard that voice Amen Emeco
[1:27:22] in it today come the corn of wheat the
[1:27:26] bride wheat had fell in the ground at
[1:27:28] night she has come back to its original
[1:27:30] word grain again
[1:27:32] praise God forever yes listen to the
[1:27:35] authenticated prophet of God who appears
[1:27:37] in this last days what he says from God
[1:27:40] the bride will say a man the spirit and
[1:27:44] the prophet in the bride will all be
[1:27:46] saying the same thing and man you won't
[1:27:50] be reading between the lines
[1:27:52] and getting something the Prophet didn't
[1:27:53] say but but what this prophet said the
[1:27:57] spirit said that's why the Prophet said
[1:28:00] it and the bride will say the same thing
[1:28:02] not something different not an act it's
[1:28:05] not adding to it not expanding it
[1:28:08] hey ma'am they're saying it now that's
[1:28:13] what the true bride does and it says
[1:28:16] come out from her and be separate the
[1:28:18] cries gone out the cries going out how
[1:28:21] long will the voice cry we do not know
[1:28:24] but one thing we do know it won't be
[1:28:28] long for this is the last age I want you
[1:28:35] to look over to your neighbor and tell
[1:28:36] them this is a la stage they ain't no
[1:28:39] more coming we're at the finish the
[1:28:45] longing of ever age has been to be at
[1:28:48] this time the desire of every church
[1:28:53] every messenger has been to be at this
[1:28:57] time and you're here any man now there's
[1:29:03] no bride age after the seventh one and
[1:29:06] when the seventh eight years the bride
[1:29:08] age
[1:29:09] yes days begin with the zuzo Street
[1:29:12] movement but it is with the bride and
[1:29:15] her rapture
[1:29:16] I hadn't even shame that some churches
[1:29:19] around the message today can't even
[1:29:21] worship and sing about the literal and
[1:29:23] physical and corporal coming of Jesus
[1:29:26] Christ cuz they say he's already come or
[1:29:29] he come in another form a man but let me
[1:29:34] tell you he that hath an ear let him
[1:29:36] hear what the Spirit says and the Spirit
[1:29:38] is spoken and man and we are looking we
[1:29:42] are people expecting the return of Jesus
[1:29:46] Christ
[1:29:47] do not take that expectation away from
[1:29:50] the church that has gotta be what our
[1:29:53] eyes is on you said what brother Tim you
[1:29:56] know he's come and he's hearing the
[1:29:58] bride form that's his appearing his
[1:30:01] coming is in a literal physical body and
[1:30:05] man we're part of his appearing the
[1:30:07] Prophet was a part of his fearing them
[1:30:08] the message was a part of his appearance
[1:30:11] but his coming is when we will see him
[1:30:15] when we see him we'll be like him what
[1:30:19] we'll see him as he is and I'm gonna say
[1:30:22] today we're here at the last stage the
[1:30:25] last of the last and it's not over and
[1:30:29] how can you be so sure because I'm still
[1:30:33] here and I know he ain't gonna leave me
[1:30:38] cuz I'm part of him are you with me hey
[1:30:43] man thank God it's not over yet they're
[1:30:47] still mercy as yet there's still grace
[1:30:51] amen
[1:30:52] but I see his demons are answering
[1:30:55] people using their body took an either
[1:30:59] Mouse we better have the blood of Jesus
[1:31:02] as brother branham himself screamed out
[1:31:05] when he looked at that bat with longer
[1:31:07] hairs come and said oh the blood Lord
[1:31:10] God the blood of Jesus Christ protect me
[1:31:12] from that we've got to have the mud
[1:31:15] that's insanity
[1:31:16] in the world and that's not my only
[1:31:20] concern there's insanity in the pulpit
[1:31:24] it's insanity to say we're not in the
[1:31:27] seventh age any longer it's insanity to
[1:31:31] pretend we're over in an eighth age
[1:31:33] somewhere it's insanity to say we're in
[1:31:37] the eighth day when you're obviously not
[1:31:39] you're right here once you tell my body
[1:31:41] it's in the eighth day it ain't and
[1:31:45] neither are you hey man we might have
[1:31:48] had two redemptions process and and have
[1:31:50] the Eternity done within our soul and
[1:31:53] I'll give you that I can also give you
[1:31:55] we've had the Moline
[1:31:56] am the eternal Sabbath rest that happens
[1:31:59] or so but we ain't in the Millennium
[1:32:00] when and they say either we are right
[1:32:04] here in the seven churches under the
[1:32:07] seventh angels message and it's insanity
[1:32:10] to say anything different spiritual
[1:32:13] insanity hey man
[1:32:16] and they saying well you know we got
[1:32:18] preachers in the pulpit today say
[1:32:20] they're saying we're not in Laodicea no
[1:32:22] more and your churches are dying and you
[1:32:25] got young people in trouble and there's
[1:32:29] still sickness in the body and we still
[1:32:32] don't have our body change and yeah and
[1:32:35] we're still having to fight against
[1:32:37] lukewarmness and you can't get people to
[1:32:40] Turks on Winston either I'm hardly
[1:32:42] Sunday anymore and you say oh we're
[1:32:46] we're not allowed to see my friend you
[1:32:49] are to see a man saying well Jesus is no
[1:33:06] longer the seed of mercy that's insanity
[1:33:08] a man saying the Christ is not the place
[1:33:12] where God chose to put his name but now
[1:33:15] it's in my group that's insanity a man
[1:33:18] the second coming of you know it is
[1:33:21] Christ coming in in a bride and and
[1:33:23] there's no literal coming that's
[1:33:25] insanity
[1:33:27] my church here in Brides forms and it's
[1:33:31] series in the church sure where his body
[1:33:34] upon the earth but he's got a body that
[1:33:37] sits there on the throne of intercessory
[1:33:41] intercession for us the high priests
[1:33:44] that can be touched by the peels of our
[1:33:47] infirmity and somebody that pay
[1:33:50] the price for us that is black we're all
[1:33:53] lost well we don't need not bleeding
[1:33:56] sacrifice today I need I need a matter
[1:33:59] ow hey man you can't look to some church
[1:34:04] to forgive your sins and my not
[1:34:07] spiritual insanity and mine we've got to
[1:34:11] have Jesus we must have him hey man the
[1:34:16] the bride is not the Catholic married
[1:34:18] that now does his intercessory work
[1:34:20] that's insanity
[1:34:22] she's not to see the mercy he is she is
[1:34:25] a redeemed
[1:34:27] not the Redeemer she is him but he is
[1:34:30] not her a man she cannot do his work his
[1:34:34] work is his atonement and her work his
[1:34:36] faith in the atonement
[1:34:38] amen sure we can intercede on the behalf
[1:34:41] of others that's what prayin is all
[1:34:43] about amen believers interceding through
[1:34:47] prayer about a need but the bride isn't
[1:34:50] the intercessor and then there's only
[1:34:52] one that God hears and that Caesars
[1:34:54] Christ and we approach hip God through
[1:34:57] his sacrifice you cannot come in the
[1:35:01] other way I hear brother branham in
[1:35:03] perfect faith I am your brother standing
[1:35:06] as your brother
[1:35:07] and intercessor trying my best to hold
[1:35:10] you before God and I'm standing right
[1:35:12] here before the white throne now and
[1:35:14] pointing my finger to that bloody
[1:35:17] sacrifice there and speaking through his
[1:35:20] name that is done that's the only way
[1:35:25] that we have power a remission of sins
[1:35:27] is pointing people to Calvary rathas
[1:35:33] fallen the mind of satan has taken over
[1:35:36] he's using bodies to tempt to destroy to
[1:35:41] kill and to speak Revelation chapter 17
[1:35:47] verse 13 says they have one mind and
[1:35:51] shall give their power and strength unto
[1:35:54] the Beast now so they they will give
[1:35:59] their power they actually give their
[1:36:02] power they yield or
[1:36:04] the yield their bodies even even their
[1:36:08] noin ting to the Beast listen we're in
[1:36:11] the time where wrath is falling on the
[1:36:14] land somebody with me therefore is the
[1:36:17] evening shadows are appearing and the
[1:36:20] rafters ready be poured out for long
[1:36:22] high up on ungodly nations upon ungodly
[1:36:25] believers the professor's without a
[1:36:28] possession of all these things brother
[1:36:31] Brennan said I've tried to unfold myself
[1:36:33] and live right among it to see that
[1:36:36] where it was standing before I said
[1:36:38] these things but now we're living in the
[1:36:40] shadows and I'll tell you what the
[1:36:43] shadows ain't got nothing but deeper
[1:36:46] demon powers and demon forces ain't got
[1:36:49] nothing but worse so though darkness is
[1:36:54] wool is even more than what it was when
[1:36:56] he was here
[1:36:58] professors without a possession wrath
[1:37:02] being poured upon the ungodly believers
[1:37:05] professors were out of possession we're
[1:37:08] living in the shadows and the rats is
[1:37:10] ready to strike and God is requiring a
[1:37:15] token that you yourself have received
[1:37:19] his token the Holy Ghost it is the only
[1:37:22] way and the only sign that God will ever
[1:37:26] pass because it's the literal life of
[1:37:29] Jesus Christ returned back to the
[1:37:33] believer hallelujah
[1:37:35] you see animal I couldn't do that the
[1:37:37] woolly lamb couldn't do that but we got
[1:37:40] a better sacrifice we have a greater
[1:37:43] atonement we've got a better covenant
[1:37:46] only one required blood in the Old
[1:37:49] Covenant it requires blood in the new
[1:37:51] covenant and without the shedding of
[1:37:54] blood there's no remission of sins hey
[1:37:58] man
[1:37:59] it has to show that a life had died that
[1:38:04] you have accepted the death of a lamb in
[1:38:07] your place now brother Branham would
[1:38:13] followed up his sermon on the token with
[1:38:16] a message called desperate
[1:38:19] and he said I would imagine the children
[1:38:22] when they saw them big black wings
[1:38:26] dropped down from the sky that smoke
[1:38:29] settling over the city
[1:38:30] can you imagine that screams coming up
[1:38:34] from every house the children mother
[1:38:37] went to the daddy and daddy and said
[1:38:39] daddy are you sure we're under that
[1:38:42] token he'd go the door and he'd look at
[1:38:46] the post the lentil and say son it's
[1:38:49] according to his word remember I'm your
[1:38:53] oldest child daddy are you are you
[1:38:55] positive
[1:38:56] I'm positive that according to what the
[1:38:59] Prophet told us in the ELSA word the
[1:39:01] Lord when I see the blood I'll pass over
[1:39:04] you take a lamb for the house I brought
[1:39:06] all you children in you're my oldest but
[1:39:10] my firstborn and that's the ones that
[1:39:12] are dying out there but there is the bud
[1:39:16] and I just want to say we can see dance
[1:39:19] and die never where we can see that that
[1:39:23] our homes are being invaded by demons we
[1:39:27] can see the churches are invaded by
[1:39:29] demons we can see everywhere that demon
[1:39:33] invasion has taken over the minds of
[1:39:35] people and they're giving their mind and
[1:39:38] their power and their Street to the
[1:39:39] Beast are you with me
[1:39:47] protection there is a place of safety
[1:39:55] [Applause]
[1:39:56] [Music]

[1:40:05] stuff in your hand if you prayed up can
[1:40:10] your child see that you're getting ready
[1:40:11] I wonder if they can tell we're getting
[1:40:15] ready to leave we're not planning on
[1:40:18] staying we're planning on leaving we're
[1:40:20] going in an exodus listen it's never
[1:40:23] type of the Bible a man and we are the
[1:40:26] anti-type which means with the
[1:40:28] fulfillment of that type so that was
[1:40:30] actually proper sign of us come on
[1:40:34] didn't we have a prophet with a pillar
[1:40:35] of fire and then we have a voice that
[1:40:38] spoke to us in our day and our own voice
[1:40:40] behind the sign then we have two signs
[1:40:43] that was shown or the sign in the hand
[1:40:46] and the end the hunger and the the
[1:40:48] binding of the serpent didn't we see
[1:40:50] that happen come on church amen haven't

[1:40:57] then we have got instructions or what to
[1:40:59] do and that is to get bad knees that
[1:41:03] blood because anything out from under
[1:41:06] the bloody Chabad is going to be rolled
[1:41:09] over them instead of blood being their
[1:41:13] sign it'll be a sign that the glory of
[1:41:16] the Lord has departed
[1:41:19] I wonder husband can your wife see it I
[1:41:27] wonder a wife can your husband see it
[1:41:32] what are we looking for what kind of

[1:46:36] which was on the token this morning from
[1:46:40] God not me listen from God not me

[1:47:57] and and say I look at that you know look
[1:48:00] at all that trouble in in that church
[1:48:02] look at that people that ain't what
[1:48:04] they're supposed to be what about you
[1:48:08] writing it down to home you know quit
[1:48:10] pointing at everybody else it look at
[1:48:12] your own self so I don't come to church
[1:48:15] saying there's too many hypocrites well
[1:48:17] you've got to be some you've got to be
[1:48:19] something you know smaller than what you
[1:48:21] hide behind so you're smaller than they
[1:48:23] are if you're hiding behind the
[1:48:25] hypocrite right amen
[1:48:29] so again the signs of his coming it
[1:48:32] should that bring this entire
[1:48:34] congregation when we read it from the
[1:48:37] words and we can see signs of his coming
[1:48:41] hey man
[1:48:42] Holy Spirit tell us go to a certain
[1:48:45] place such as such things not not tell
[1:48:48] us what it was but it would happen we'd
[1:48:51] go there it happens this way newspaper
[1:48:53] Packard magazine packet show the
[1:48:55] pictures of it come back see these great
[1:48:57] mysteries hidden in the Bible open to us
[1:48:59] on a new field that we never knew before
[1:49:01] and purfling
[1:49:02] perfectly blends into the coming of the
[1:49:05] Lord Jesus now what we read about today
[1:49:12] was about a Passover simply means that
[1:49:17] they when the Death Angel passed over
[1:49:21] the house passed over because of the
[1:49:26] blood
[1:49:27] I would should understand we're in
[1:49:29] another Passover because the death
[1:49:35] angels all around hey man now the
[1:49:39] Passover represented it typed out
[1:49:42] salvation because it was it was a
[1:49:44] salvation from death right but in order
[1:49:49] for it to be effective it must be fully
[1:49:54] applied now partially fully applied now
[1:50:00] there was the examining of the Lamb that
[1:50:03] we read about it was taken up on the tip
[1:50:06] day keppen to the 14th so the lamb was
[1:50:09] killed after give up for three days like
[1:50:11] to read it to you in Exodus chapter 12
[1:50:14] verse 21 and we'll we'll read the
[1:50:17] description of what he would have them
[1:50:19] to do now this is the whole order of
[1:50:22] salvation the salvation from it from the
[1:50:26] death down in Egypt we want to look at
[1:50:29] this because it was a type of our own
[1:50:31] salvation then Moses called for all the
[1:50:34] elders of israel said unto them draw out
[1:50:36] and take your lamb according to your
[1:50:38] families and kill the Passover so
[1:50:43] remember it's a lamb for a house and
[1:50:47] that is not good enough to do it at the
[1:50:50] church every family must have the land
[1:50:58] it's not just a church attendance thing
[1:51:01] every family every house must have a
[1:51:05] lamb now let me bring it down beyond
[1:51:09] your dwelling then let's bring it down
[1:51:11] to this house this flesh every house
[1:51:14] must have a lamb
[1:51:19] hey man are you with me ever house ain't
[1:51:23] good enough your mama's got it and good
[1:51:26] enough your daddy's got it
[1:51:27] are they good enough your kids is the
[1:51:29] one that's got it you gotta have the
[1:51:32] land man you said well they did that I'm
[1:51:36] talking about them I talk about you this
[1:51:39] ain't about what others are doing with
[1:51:41] Jesus this is about water yellow light
[1:51:44] red Jesus well you don't know what
[1:51:50] people have done to me I could care less
[1:51:51] what people have done to you I'm sorry
[1:51:54] for your heartaches and your troubles
[1:51:56] but friends and your real problem ain't
[1:51:58] them people your real problem is your
[1:52:00] own self you're gonna have to deal with
[1:52:06] the devil inside a mountain coz ever
[1:52:12] want to be a born with sin nature and
[1:52:14] you got to deal with that devil now I
[1:52:21] want you to listen draw out take a lamb
[1:52:25] according your families kill the
[1:52:26] Passover and you shall take a bunch of
[1:52:29] high septon and dip it in the blood that
[1:52:34] is in the basin and strike the lentil
[1:52:37] and the two side posts with the blood
[1:52:39] that is in the basin and none of you
[1:52:42] shall go out the door of his house until
[1:52:45] the morning stay under the blood till we
[1:52:48] leave
[1:52:50] we're leaving in the morning hold that
[1:52:54] bright and cloudless morning when the
[1:52:57] big rush arise a man stay in there until
[1:53:01] under the blood until we leave to get
[1:53:05] the call to come on out but the Lord
[1:53:08] will pass through to smite the Egyptians
[1:53:11] and whom he when he seeth the blood upon
[1:53:13] the lentil and on the two side posts
[1:53:15] the Lord will pass over the door and
[1:53:17] will not suffer the destroyer to come in
[1:53:21] your house to smite you so now we got a
[1:53:27] lot of steps in here that maybe you
[1:53:28] overlooked the lamb was examined it had
[1:53:33] to be a perfect lamb a man I don't think
[1:53:38] we can get a more perfect lamb than
[1:53:40] Jesus Christ hey man everything everyone
[1:53:44] had to say he's without blame Pilate
[1:53:47] said I find no fault in the lamb has
[1:53:51] been examined I would like to submit
[1:53:54] that you know we went over and over and
[1:53:58] over through the ages examining the lamb
[1:54:01] talking about him how perfect he was how
[1:54:06] good he was how he healed how he was
[1:54:09] without blemish we've had a lot of
[1:54:12] sermons on the land
[1:54:25] Jesus is not gonna save you what's gonna
[1:54:29] save you is when his life comes into
[1:54:32] your life hey ma'am the blood was then
[1:54:40] collected in a basement so now we got a
[1:54:43] good collection collectors meeting going
[1:54:45] on I got the blood I've got a collection
[1:54:50] I I have the blood in the basin then the
[1:54:54] blood was dipped in high suppori hyssop
[1:54:58] and the blood was applied in
[1:55:02] the doorposts of the lentil hey man now
[1:55:07] that's what's shown on the outside on
[1:55:09] the inside is the eating the lamb and
[1:55:12] the unleavened bread and preparations
[1:55:19] made to leave all of this is a part of
[1:55:22] it now all of this is a part of steps to
[1:55:27] fulfill in the Passover salvation to be
[1:55:29] saved from death is to escape the coming
[1:55:32] wrath now Brent wrath is coming you just
[1:55:37] think things have got bad with school
[1:55:39] shootings and people going crazy and
[1:55:41] shooting up you know schools and
[1:55:43] innocent people and people dying in all
[1:55:46] kinds of trouble going on and insanity
[1:55:49] insanity everywhere you just think it's
[1:55:53] bad now just wait until all hell is
[1:55:56] loosed and man we're just weird to wait
[1:55:59] to those things that have been placed in
[1:56:02] the imagination of people that got in
[1:56:04] their spirit realm become to be Mallett
[1:56:06] come out of it to haunt them and to
[1:56:09] torment them when they realize I am
[1:56:13] still filthy and there's no way to get
[1:56:16] clean and still unholy enough righteous
[1:56:23] and there's no one nothing hurts me I
[1:56:26] miss my chance
[1:56:36] all these other steps are good
[1:56:40] examine the lamb it's a perfect
[1:56:43] sacrifice without blemish that's good he
[1:56:47] is a worthy lamb making a profession of
[1:56:52] faith is good a man guarantee the the
[1:56:58] hyssop was good got a habit collecting
[1:57:04] the blood and the basin was good got to
[1:57:07] do that applied the blood with hyssop is
[1:57:12] it's a is the type or represents faith
[1:57:18] now what she gives us it represents
[1:57:22] faith where you can't apply the blood
[1:57:25] without hyssop you cannot apply de life
[1:57:32] the blood the Holy Ghost
[1:57:34] without hyssop without faith without
[1:57:37] faith it's impossible to please God hey
[1:57:41] man now but I'll tell you you can have
[1:57:45] all the hits if you want and wave it in
[1:57:47] the face of the Death Angel and say I
[1:57:51] believe I believe I believe in Christ I
[1:57:54] believe it's a perfect lamb
[1:57:56] I believe you can wave that you've got
[1:58:02] all this space
[1:58:05] I believe a prophet I believe the
[1:58:09] Holy Ghost huh I believe in all of it
[1:58:13] but without blood on that hyssop unless
[1:58:16] the Holy Ghost comes and your nights
[1:58:18] with your face and gets applied to your
[1:58:22] life the Death Angel still got you you
[1:58:25] can stand out and wave all the hits of
[1:58:28] you all the death angels still coming in
[1:58:30] your land when I see the black
[1:58:40] just as Israel needed hyssop you must
[1:58:44] also have the blood applied you need the
[1:58:49] hyssop but you gotta apply the blood
[1:58:52] your faith wasn't given to you to accept
[1:58:58] the creed or a statement of faith the
[1:59:03] hyssop without blood is this hyssop
[1:59:05] believe it in the message is not enough
[1:59:09] follow my thinking now just for a moment
[1:59:11] believing the seals are open it's only
[1:59:15] hyssop your faith is not to be in the
[1:59:22] seals you didn't hear what I said did
[1:59:25] you your faith is not to be your faith
[1:59:28] for salvation is not in the seals and
[1:59:31] understanding those mysteries your faith
[1:59:35] is not in the seals your faith has to be
[1:59:37] in the blood that was shed Presley for
[1:59:40] you hey ma'am your faith must be
[1:59:46] anointed plunge depth if the blood the
[1:59:50] Holy Spirit and then the blood the Holy
[1:59:53] Spirit applied to sit out the death
[1:59:56] angel
[2:00:00] striking the doorposts with hyssop that
[2:00:03] isn't draw dipped in blood will
[2:00:04] accomplish nothing you can proclaim but
[2:00:11] I'm bride let me tell you the only way
[2:00:12] your bride is that you're under the
[2:00:15] blood not because of you
[2:00:19] you ascribed a certain set of teachings
[2:00:22] you've been educated into the message
[2:00:25] but because you met Christ do you hear
[2:00:31] me there are spiritual Israelites today
[2:00:35] who claim to believe and have a hyssop
[2:00:38] in their hands but are not a trace of
[2:00:41] the blood and because of this you see
[2:00:44] the Death Angel is all over them it
[2:00:48] comes in their house it enters through
[2:00:52] the eye uses tools of the of the enemy
[2:00:57] to set before your eyes evil things it
[2:01:00] comes in your house with television with
[2:01:03] Hollywood dress with makeup with
[2:01:07] pornography with slothful lazy lies no
[2:01:12] desperation no sincerity no dedication
[2:01:19] I'm a superintendent limiter of Mother's
[2:01:23] Day sermon it's one of the greatest I'll
[2:01:24] ever preach because he the greatest
[2:01:27] desire of a mother is to see her
[2:01:29] children walk in truth
[2:01:35] you can't just imagine you're safe
[2:01:38] you've got to be saved from wrath see
[2:01:47] the Death Angel all over people's lives
[2:01:50] you can see it in the way they dress the
[2:01:52] way they act the way they conduct
[2:01:54] themselves the death angels dare it's
[2:02:00] got a snare about a Gotham you got a
[2:02:02] chokehold on them it's gonna be too late

[2:03:58] token there you say ah

[2:04:15] have the token gets right
[2:04:19] it's not enough just to have it
[2:04:22] collected in the bowl and somehow you
[2:04:25] know wewe got something stuff there was
[2:04:27] a lamb died there for that man and sin
[2:04:31] as bad as midnight you must have a
[2:04:34] listen to what the word says you go to
[2:04:37] church you try to live right that's fine
[2:04:40] but that I believe the message obey you
[2:04:44] obey that messenger come in the crisis
[2:04:48] that well but I believe every word said
[2:04:51] brother Branham that's good but that's
[2:04:53] just being able to read take the message
[2:04:59] take it in your heart that you must have
[2:05:02] the token the very light that was in
[2:05:05] Christ being you when I see that I'll
[2:05:07] pass over you
[2:05:09] a man by faith they applied the blood
[2:05:14] see before it was actually happened the
[2:05:16] blood was applied by faith believing it
[2:05:18] was going to happen for the wrath of God
[2:05:20] pass through the land the blood had to
[2:05:22] be applied it was too late
[2:05:25] after the wrath had fallen like Noah's
[2:05:30] dark I didn't Noah's Ark the door was
[2:05:34] shut and there comes a time that God
[2:05:37] shuts the door the door shut and when it
[2:05:43] is Satan is sealed out I wonder when the
[2:05:48] door is shut to your heart are you with
[2:05:52] me a man
[2:05:54] Satan is sealed out judgment waters are
[2:05:58] sealed out
[2:05:59] they can't get into you the rabbit is
[2:06:03] coming can't get to you because why the
[2:06:07] door is shut shut the door no man can
[2:06:13] open it no can open it no demon can open
[2:06:17] it when Satan has sealed out he can't
[2:06:26] use your body he can't use your tongue
[2:06:29] he can't use your boss the Bradham said
[2:06:38] in the breach he said a seal signifies
[2:06:41] ownership the seal has a mark on it it
[2:06:44] shows ownership when you were bought by
[2:06:47] the blood of Jesus Christ sealed by the
[2:06:50] Holy Ghost you no longer belong to the
[2:06:52] world or anything pertaining to the
[2:06:54] world you are owned by God man how many
[2:06:59] can say that's what I want to be owned
[2:07:01] by God his property man because when he
[2:07:05] owns you he puts a sign in your life
[2:07:09] that says keep out
[2:07:11] [Music]
[2:07:13] devil you take stanniehumber oh no no
[2:07:19] the blood has been applied your own by
[2:07:23] God another thing a seal is a security a
[2:07:28] seal means you're secured if you don't
[2:07:31] believe in eternal security I don't know
[2:07:32] but a seal signifies security to its
[2:07:35] destination and the Holy Spirit seal
[2:07:39] cannot be broken you all were you all
[2:07:42] heard me say that people said the devil
[2:07:44] made me do this no no that devil didn't
[2:07:47] do it you just wasn't sealed in so that
[2:07:50] because when you are sealed in he is
[2:07:53] sealed out now you went out to him he
[2:07:59] couldn't get into you because the only
[2:08:01] way he could get to you as they come to
[2:08:03] the same process that you have he'd have
[2:08:05] to be saved sanctified filled with the
[2:08:07] Holy Ghost that he'd be your brother he
[2:08:09] didn't do it no you just went to the
[2:08:10] borderline and come back lesson for the
[2:08:14] things of the world never went all the
[2:08:16] way in the Canaan you see across Jordan
[2:08:18] death to self that's a whole problem
[2:08:21] note this when the blood is up correctly
[2:08:26] applied the Holy Ghost is on your
[2:08:29] doorpost the entry to your soul and
[2:08:34] there's no ain't no death angel gonna
[2:08:37] get past that seal are you with me God's
[2:08:41] only provided place of worship brother
[2:08:43] bread and said now this is my pinch just
[2:08:45] a little bit and I feel it pinching
[2:08:47] quite a bit this morning but you know
[2:08:49] I've learned to preach whether you say
[2:08:51] outro me or hallelujah
[2:08:55] this may pitch just a little bit notice
[2:08:58] don't fall out with me
[2:08:59] just remember when Israel once looked on
[2:09:02] that door with that blood on the door
[2:09:04] the name the blood the life and entered
[2:09:07] him under that blood they never went out
[2:09:09] again until they went out of Egypt
[2:09:12] grieve not the Holy Spirit of God where
[2:09:14] where in you go in and don't go out
[2:09:16] anymore until
[2:09:18] the day you are redeemed out you know
[2:09:20] the Bible is always right he puts his
[2:09:22] word in there and you've got to place it
[2:09:25] out where it goes to make it to make the
[2:09:27] hope picture of redemption see grieve
[2:09:29] not the Holy Spirit of God whereby
[2:09:31] you're sealed unto your redemption til
[2:09:35] you're redeemed you're sealed in there
[2:09:38] you're redeemed your beneath the blood
[2:09:41] you don't go out no more and then what
[2:09:45] what are you God's son the end the
[2:09:48] family seal him by the Holy Spirit the
[2:09:52] devil couldn't get to you if he had to
[2:09:55] and you are buried and your life is
[2:09:59] hidden God through Christ and sealed by
[2:10:02] the Holy Ghost how's he gonna get to you
[2:10:05] how you gonna get out there that's it
[2:10:12] brother went that Holy Spirit seal is
[2:10:14] there you don't go out no more and he
[2:10:18] don't get in hallelujah the blood the
[2:10:24] Holy Ghost is your protection against
[2:10:27] the Death Angel a man now if you was
[2:10:31] ready for a Baptist sermon this morning
[2:10:33] your Baptist time is up we're gonna keep
[2:10:35] preaching a man to the rest of you that
[2:10:38] ain't Baptist and the rest of you can
[2:10:41] get the Holy Ghost in your life man and
[2:10:44] then you can just take all the word when
[2:10:46] it comes
[2:10:46] hey ma'am I I'm not doing off of the
[2:10:49] Baptist it could be Methodists or
[2:10:51] Presbyterian or Pentecostal we need to
[2:10:53] be sons and daughters of God is that
[2:10:57] right
[2:10:58] not denominational Christian born-again
[2:11:00] Christians now this is the evening time
[2:11:03] at the age that we live in evening time
[2:11:05] for the church he said it's evening time
[2:11:08] for me evening time of my message I'm
[2:11:11] dying I'm moving out I'm moving out
[2:11:13] I'm going in the evening time of the
[2:11:15] gospel we come up through justification
[2:11:17] and so forth but this is the time that
[2:11:20] the token has to be applied now listen
[2:11:23] this I told you last Sunday I had
[2:11:27] something I want to talk to you about
[2:11:29] and this is it
[2:11:31] the time that when you just keep playing
[2:11:35] with it it's gotta be done if it's ever
[2:11:41] going to be done it's got to be done now
[2:11:43] because we can see the wrath is about
[2:11:46] ready to pass through the land and
[2:11:49] everything from under that token that's
[2:11:52] the blood the Holy Ghost will perish
[2:11:55] it's on the Passover time there was a
[2:11:58] lamb that was slain the blood was
[2:12:01] collected placed in the basin but then
[2:12:04] it must be dipped in the hyssop and
[2:12:07] applied and displayed on the doorpost as
[2:12:10] a sign or a token that the lamb had died
[2:12:15] now understand in our day we don't have
[2:12:18] the chemistry of the blood but we have
[2:12:21] the life of the blood we have to dip our
[2:12:23] faith in Christ in the Holy Ghost and
[2:12:27] pride the Holy Ghost to the doorposts of
[2:12:30] our hearts are you with me without the
[2:12:33] blood determinate the book is a nun
[2:12:37] effect hey man now people are Wonder
[2:12:42] dangers and what we've got the book
[2:12:43] we've got the word we got the word we
[2:12:45] got the word and they don't have to but
[2:12:48] email them without the blood the word
[2:12:51] that's not fact it ain't yours unless
[2:12:55] you're doing to it by the blood the
[2:12:58] blood is what connects you to the world
[2:13:02] so you can claim I believe the message I
[2:13:04] believe I believe I believe all you want
[2:13:06] to but in you and the only way you can
[2:13:08] and you can really be in is to be
[2:13:10] connected by the Holy Ghost by
[2:13:13] experience with God yourself now so in
[2:13:22] the Passover time a lamb was slain the
[2:13:25] blood collected placed in a basement but
[2:13:27] then had to be displayed as a sign that
[2:13:30] the lamb had died and its blood had been
[2:13:34] accepted in your place without the blood
[2:13:38] the Covenant the book is it not in
[2:13:42] effect now we're here again we can go
[2:13:44] and talk all we want to well the seals
[2:13:47] are open the books been taken and the
[2:13:49] seals are revealed but it had it is not
[2:13:51] yours unless you're joined to it by the
[2:13:55] blood unless you're joined to it by a
[2:13:59] birth by the Holy Ghost it is not yours
[2:14:03] it's just like it's just like you know
[2:14:06] that you know when with my when my
[2:14:09] father died or you know your parents
[2:14:11] died or whatever there was a wheel right
[2:14:16] and there there's a wheel you know now
[2:14:18] I've come all of y'all didn't show up to
[2:14:20] the wheel when it was red where my
[2:14:23] parents died cuz he wasn't his offspring
[2:14:26] you deformed to him what nothing in that
[2:14:31] book of his will yours
[2:14:36] so of course you didn't hear about it
[2:14:38] and if you did hear about it you didn't
[2:14:41] even bother to show up coming right cuz
[2:14:46] your name wasn't in the book you know
[2:14:50] people want to say well it's for
[2:14:52] everybody let me tell you unless you're
[2:14:54] enjoying by the bud I meant the reason
[2:14:58] why that I was in my family's my
[2:15:00] father's book of inheritance and
[2:15:02] somebody with me
[2:15:03] amen is because I was born of his blood
[2:15:06] and because I was born of his blood I
[2:15:10] had a right to inherit from it you have
[2:15:13] no right of inheritance from God unless
[2:15:16] your power knob is black you have to be
[2:15:20] enjoined to the Covenant by the blood
[2:15:24] the Holy Ghost otherwise it's not for
[2:15:32] you until that happens you can go you
[2:15:41] sit there like a and I no wonder
[2:15:46] sometimes how many people have sat there
[2:15:48] in meetings and servers after service
[2:15:52] and their name didn't get called the
[2:15:56] message never stirred their heart never
[2:15:59] moved on well you know it may be that we
[2:16:08] just ain't got down to your name yet but
[2:16:16] today you happen to be here one more
[2:16:21] time
[2:16:22] right now you can hear your name
[2:16:29] [Applause]
[2:16:47] without the bun the Tevin it is not an
[2:16:51] in effect it's a Bible it's a book but
[2:16:57] it ain't yours got a little good things
[2:17:01] in it but it ain't yours got some nice
[2:17:05] property in it but it ain't yours until
[2:17:10] you get born again it must be applied
[2:17:17] the blood cannot just be kept in a
[2:17:22] bucket somewhere can't be some kind of
[2:17:25] secret boy about we just can't put the
[2:17:30] Holy Ghost in a bucket and sit it over
[2:17:32] in the corner it's got to be applied now
[2:17:35] Israel didn't just go up and say well I
[2:17:37] tell you what you know it'll be a
[2:17:39] privilege today to hear Moses speak you

[2:17:56] even about coming together to talk about
[2:17:58] the message it's about get beneath the
[2:18:02] bat well what do you think about it you
[2:18:11] know my fellow Jews what do you think
[2:18:14] about a mr. Levinsky what do you think
[2:18:16] about it what wonder what do you think
[2:18:17] about when that blood kicked down the
[2:18:20] Holy Ghost tent down in the audience and
[2:18:24] moved over a little lady and gave a
[2:18:27] victory in her heart and that cancer
[2:18:29] that had her played I'm not talking
[2:18:32] fiction here I'm talking about what
[2:18:35] really happened and that devil couldn't

[2:18:52] delivers God yeah you know you know
[2:18:54] Moses I I saw them frogs come out of
[2:18:56] that that one time I don't know it just

[2:19:03] well are you circumcised hole yes sir

[2:19:17] us all of that it is not gonna work you
[2:19:20] got to have the bud a man no matter how
[2:19:25] much you believe you got to come into
[2:19:27] covenant with God yourself you got to
[2:19:30] get beneath the blood now brother

[2:19:46] the blood God made it clear that all
[2:19:50] from under that blood will perish now

[2:20:15] with me and Matt brother Brendan said he
[2:20:18] was sitting down in the woods
[2:20:20] and the boys was wandering in here two
[2:20:23] days you didn't even shoot a squirrel
[2:20:25] what's the matter he said that was it
[2:20:27] God said place it upon him upon them
[2:20:32] said you talk to me about it now it's in
[2:20:35] your lap it's in yours he won't
[2:20:38] recognize nothing but that covenant of
[2:20:41] the Holy Spirit you
[2:20:42] can't receive you can't cannot receive
[2:20:45] that cabinet unless you're saved
[2:20:47] sanctified and baptized in that body he
[2:20:50] will not you might have an impersonation
[2:20:53] you might feel good I think sometimes
[2:20:56] that's a problem we just pray long
[2:20:58] enough till we get the feeling a little
[2:20:59] better
[2:21:00] Nellie Sanders got to bring down the
[2:21:03] butch at that little sweet peace come on
[2:21:08] jump up and down speaking terms dancing
[2:21:11] the spirit I don't have one thing to do
[2:21:13] with it
[2:21:13] share it in the name of the Lord God
[2:21:16] don't recognize that heathens do that
[2:21:18] witches do that you say now here to come
[2:21:20] to the other side
[2:21:21] I'm a scholar and brother have we made
[2:21:25] scholars out of people around the
[2:21:26] message we've drilled it and we put it
[2:21:30] in weave we pressed it down we taught
[2:21:33] them this and we taught them that all of
[2:21:35] that teaching is not the token man the
[2:21:39] token is a personal experience with God
[2:21:41] that changes your life not educating you
[2:21:46] into a doctrine but didn't you feel with
[2:21:49] life some of you have heard it since she
[2:21:53] was a child on your mother's knee but
[2:21:55] it's my dad he's gonna save you one bit
[2:22:01] since he said he's the devil don't scare
[2:22:05] how much a scholar you are he is - hey
[2:22:10] man
[2:22:11] he only recognizes a token now listen
[2:22:15] that's the message of the app that's the
[2:22:20] message of this day that's the message
[2:22:24] of this time in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:22:28] receive it
[2:22:30] [Music]
[2:22:34] brother Brendan said the in evening time
[2:22:37] message is to apply the token that's the
[2:22:43] assets I wonder sometimes that we miss
[2:22:47] the message educating indoctrinating
[2:22:53] teaching all of that is good but if you
[2:22:57] miss that life you ain't nothing but a
[2:23:02] Pharisee a good Amish some Mennonite boy
[2:23:06] her girl taught how to conform you've
[2:23:10] got to have the life notice they were
[2:23:20] not just yet to come together to talk
[2:23:22] about the message and that's what we've
[2:23:25] done we've done a lot of talking about
[2:23:27] it they come together to apply the blood
[2:23:32] apply the token now brother Branham
[2:23:36] after he preached the seals he evaluated
[2:23:38] his own church and and he spoke I'm a
[2:23:43] you know just before his token sermon he
[2:23:47] would tell his son that his church
[2:23:49] Sunday I've got something I've got a
[2:23:51] present to you I've gotta talk to you
[2:23:53] and this is what he said he said when we

[2:23:59] purpose this is the house of correction
[2:24:02] this is the throne this is a throne of
[2:24:05] God and gentleman goes forth from the
[2:24:07] house of God and here's what we come
[2:24:09] together gather in love with one another
[2:24:11] as only Christians can love but in here
[2:24:14] we're under the leadership of the Holy
[2:24:15] Spirit and the Holy Ghost is among us
[2:24:17] and we're here to take reckoning among
[2:24:20] us to see where our short places are our
[2:24:24] shortcomings and how we can catch from
[2:24:27] where we should be or over to where we
[2:24:30] ought to be now where we are and where
[2:24:32] we ought to be and that's what we study
[2:24:35] ministers study those places for their
[2:24:38] people when they see the people the lack
[2:24:41] then they begin all that
[2:24:45] hey ma'am I take case study for you
[2:24:49] that's why it takes a preaching hey

[2:27:54] society bracket I bet God is restoring
[2:28:00] the glory to his touch again
[2:28:07] hallelujah that's a same grade in the
[2:28:11] beginning the last days hey man it's
[2:28:27] come down from pagan to Wesley on the
[2:28:31] Pentecost season from glory to glory
[2:28:33] producing the hidden matter and he said
[2:28:37] and now it's ripe to bring him back it
[2:28:39] softly like he was at the beginning his
[2:28:42] same ministry the same Jesus the same
[2:28:45] power the same Holy Ghost the same one
[2:28:48] that came on the day of Pentecost is the
[2:28:50] same Holy Ghost as manifested today from
[2:28:53] glory unto glory under glory and back to
[2:28:58] its original seed with the baptism of
[2:29:00] the Holy Ghost with the same sign same
[2:29:03] wonders same baptism same kind of people
[2:29:05] acting the same way with the same power
[2:29:08] the same sensation it's some glory to
[2:29:11] glory and the next will be are you ready
[2:29:13] for the next the next will be changed
[2:29:16] from this glory and to a body like his
[2:29:19] own glorious body where we shall see him
[2:29:23] I remember I remember that day when I
[2:29:29] preached I brought out 1st Corinthians
[2:29:34] 11 that a woman's glory is her hair and
[2:29:38] the Bible said she is not to cut it a
[2:29:43] mile on preaching Bible I'm not
[2:29:46] preaching churchianity I'm preaching
[2:29:47] Bible we're talking about what the Bible
[2:29:50] said hey man you all this other death in
[2:29:53] the camp that's so that's somebody
[2:29:55] else's business I'm not preaching death
[2:29:57] I'm preaching life hey man
[2:30:00] same thing it tells a man that he's not
[2:30:02] to have long hair he's to cut it off you
[2:30:05] know the Holy Ghost will make a man a
[2:30:08] man masculine and make a woman feminine
[2:30:12] oh yeah it really will that's what the
[2:30:16] holy ghost will do but I was preaching
[2:30:17] that day and I'd mentioned that that
[2:30:20] hair is a woman's glory well I said why
[2:30:23] would you want to trim that glory off
[2:30:25] and I looked out there after preaching
[2:30:28] that sermon it was just part of my
[2:30:30] sermon that they know inspiration the
[2:30:32] Lord gave it to me and then I looked out
[2:30:35] there and saw that little bald-headed
[2:30:37] girl with a little cap on her head and I
[2:30:40] said just like right this ain't right
[2:30:45] that child of God the daughter of God a
[2:30:49] daughter that came be robbed of her
[2:30:51] glory what the Bible tells us that
[2:30:55] that's her glory and the devil have
[2:30:57] robbed that and I said weird not
[2:30:59] standard for it cuddled down here Mariah
[2:31:01] will laid hands on her that day and
[2:31:03] rebuke that devil the process was
[2:31:11] beginning right there things begin to
[2:31:13] happen the cops have God's wheels
[2:31:15] prophecy was taking place and here she
[2:31:19] stands today with restored glory and
[2:31:22] relax
[2:31:26] oh wow but we said there's no culture
[2:31:32] there's no statement there's no devil
[2:31:35] that is going to take the glory away
[2:31:39] [Applause]
[2:31:44] risen king mother son Jesus Christ
[2:31:48] the same yesterday today and forever
[2:31:56] ah you know I can say why God don't care
[2:32:00] about such a small thing is that you
[2:32:02] remember their people right here in this
[2:32:05] church can remember that God called out
[2:32:08] a woman whose name was Mary over that I
[2:32:10] won't call her last name but you all
[2:32:13] know who I'm talking about a lot of you
[2:32:15] do Mary was a beautician now lives up in
[2:32:19] the Indiana somewhere I don't know her
[2:32:21] but anyway make quite a change but stop
[2:32:26] short of the token a man stopped short
[2:32:31] of getting the Holy Ghost I met her and
[2:32:32] her husband my office one day she was so
[2:32:35] agitated and angry just so but on her
[2:32:41] nerves and anger and on the eggs
[2:32:44] speaking to me and the Holy Spirit came
[2:32:48] down on that room and Satan was cast out
[2:32:51] I remember just like it was yesterday
[2:32:56] and after that devil was cast out news
[2:32:59] there was a sweet peace came upon her
[2:33:02] she was sat down in the chair what sound
[2:33:05] asleep for over an hour while my husband
[2:33:09] and I spoke she got up from there
[2:33:13] different person and I took the
[2:33:16] scripture and I said you've had your
[2:33:19] problems now as a beautician you think
[2:33:23] you know everything about it
[2:33:25] but here's what the Bible said I said
[2:33:31] now don't you ever cut your hair again
[2:33:36] problem was she got emptied out but
[2:33:38] didn't get filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:33:40] what long that the devil started coming
[2:33:43] back little by little scratching at the
[2:33:47] door she let it in here and let it in
[2:33:49] there then again flirtin with she
[2:33:51] thought she knew everything about Herod
[2:33:53] she was a beautician she's looking at
[2:33:55] her hair one day this is say nothing
[2:33:59] wrong with cutting man I need her dead
[2:34:01] ends here I'll just cut them off her
[2:34:05] husband was getting ready for work that
[2:34:06] day
[2:34:08] she was coming her hair getting ready to
[2:34:10] go to church looking how I'm gonna cut
[2:34:12] this off you know you don't mean nothing
[2:34:14] to God he just kind of looked at her
[2:34:20] didn't say a word knew better didn't say
[2:34:23] anything she was feisty he just looked
[2:34:29] over at her she said I'll knocked out
[2:34:33] other eye out of you so but I'll tell
[2:34:35] you what I'm gonna go to church today
[2:34:38] and if we'll find out whether God cut
[2:34:44] cares about that or not said I'll go to
[2:34:48] church I'll make a deal with him if
[2:34:50] brother Tim don't say nothing about hair
[2:34:55] I'll know there's nothing wrong with it
[2:34:58] that God don't care it'll be our sign
[2:35:01] she marches herself in church and sits
[2:35:04] down in the service and I'm in the
[2:35:06] middle of my sermon and I stop it in the
[2:35:10] middle and I look at her and I says in
[2:35:13] that right sister Mary you remember that
[2:35:16] day in that office when God told you not
[2:35:19] to cut your hair again you remember what
[2:35:22] God did for you that day don't you dare
[2:35:24] forget it
[2:35:25] and she broke down crying she doesn't
[2:35:30] wield it in her seat cried and I went to
[2:35:32] her after church and I said sister I
[2:35:34] didn't mean to call you out and
[2:35:36] embarrass you today she supposed him no
[2:35:39] you didn't embarrass me you exposed the
[2:35:41] very things that was in my heart
[2:35:43] I meant God cares
[2:35:49] but sometimes later the dip to come back
[2:35:52] but let me just tell you Church let's
[2:35:56] talk about you this morning let's talk
[2:35:58] about that restored glory that God's
[2:36:01] doing brother Benton said but Gary is a
