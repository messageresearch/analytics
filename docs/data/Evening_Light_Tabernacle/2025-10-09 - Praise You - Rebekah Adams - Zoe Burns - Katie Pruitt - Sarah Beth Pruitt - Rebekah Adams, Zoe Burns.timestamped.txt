[0:01] [Music]
[0:12] You're not there. I'll never drift from
[0:16] your love and care. There's not a thing
[0:20] about me that you don't know.
[0:24] [Music]
[0:27] The wings of the morning will take me to
[0:30] you. The blackness of night, your love
[0:34] will shine through. You're already
[0:36] there. No matter where I may go,
[0:44] even before
[0:46] I came to be, your loving eyes were
[0:51] looking at me. You're even closer than
[0:55] the very breath that I take.
[1:02] Mother and father, more than a friend to
[1:05] me, beginning and ending and living a
[1:09] life to be a song I find myself singing
[1:14] when I awake.
[1:18] Oh, I
[1:23] will praise you.
[1:40] I praise you
[1:45] for bearing me up and giving me wings.
[1:49] For lifting my eyes to heavenly things.
[1:53] For being a song I can't help but sing.
[1:59] Praise you.
[2:02] [Music]
[2:04] Look at me, Lord. I'm open to you. Do
[2:09] anything that you want to do. If you
[2:13] know me better, then I know myself.
[2:21] I'll not be afraid of what you can see.
[2:25] Cuz you know the
[2:27] inside of me. I won't even try to hide
[2:32] what you know so well.
[2:38] Now Lord, be patient with my mistakes. I
[2:42] want to be yours. Whatever it takes,
[2:46] I've learned that life without you is no
[2:50] life at all.
[2:55] Failures and talents, schemes I bring to
[2:58] you. Aspirations
[3:01] and dreams I sing to you. I'll just be
[3:04] here ready whenever you go.
[3:10] So I
[3:15] will praise you.
[3:19] [Music]
[3:24] I praise you.
[3:32] I praise you
[3:36] for bearing me up and giving me wings.
[3:41] For lifting my sides to heavenly things.
[3:45] For being the song I can't help but
[3:48] sing.
[3:50] Praise you.
[3:54] Oh, I
[3:59] will praise you,
[4:04] Lord.
[4:08] I praise you
[4:12] now.
[4:16] I praise you
[4:20] for bearing me up and giving me wings.
[4:24] For lifting my sights to heavenly
[4:27] things. For being a song I can't help
[4:32] but sing.
[4:34] Praise you.
[4:41] [Music]
[4:42] [Applause]
