across the land lord these ministers May Lord the evening lights shine bright today and oh God rekind the lights and never hearts and every life everywhere Lord and in this place we ask it in Jesus name amen and amen God bless you thank you amen we appreciate the the music thank you very much God bless you I'd like to turn to Genesis 18 before you're seated so Genesis 18 and we'll read from verse 1 and then I want to go immediately to verse 9 and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah was well were old and well spoken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore she laughed within herself saying after I am old and waxed old and shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I of assured he bear a child which I'm old is anything too hard for the Lord at that time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied Saiyan I laughed not for she was afraid but he said nay but thou did his life amen God bless you can be seated amen I I just wanted to take a time a moment here while we're all home as a homebody and be able to express my my appreciation and my love to you and gratitude for um a wonderful time that you gave everybody at the at our October meetings it was a just a tremendous time in the Lord and and I want to say thank you for what you did and the part that you played every one of you making a contribution somewhere and you know I I want to thank you for giving shade as an old oak tree and keeping people in your homes and and providing food and helping out in many other ways and uh you know the preparations for the meetings and after the meetings and everything that was done and our servants to this church the the deacons and trustees they worked so hard and and they work but everything just worked so seamless seamlessly you you know it just was like a well-oiled machine and you know just everything went from there all the way through the the plan the food preparations and and the the meal that we shared together the after uh after service snack bags that people could take home we do that because a lot of times there isn't anything open that that many people could go find something and so we do that so that it'll make it a little easier for them lift a burden and we we so appreciate the many who came and was a part of that meeting and you know we we just had the Servants of the Lord the ministry the musicians the the singers that served so well and did tremendously and I just want to say I am so proud of you amen you did so well I uh received this from Brother Kalin sing from South Africa and I thought he summed up the meetings for us pretty well and brother Kalin is some Minister friend of mine Pastor over there near Durbin somewhere hour or so away from there and has this little church there and we have been corresponding probably the last 10 15 years and and that I've been in contact with him and um so you know we he listens into a lot of our services like right now today brother DeWitt from around Johannesburg is listening in the end God bless you brother DeWitt from evening like Tabernacle and may God restore Health to you and and also we we have men like brother Buzz Bosey that listens in from Uganda as a pastor there and also a pastor Singh there in the Durban area and many others that that listen in we hear regularly from Brother Wilson from another part around the Cape of South Africa so you know then then from different places from Denmark Sweden uh you know just around the world and so we we just want today to say we appreciate them and greet them but brother Kailyn kind of wrote after the the meetings and he kind of summed it up for me and he said all I can say is that evening light Tabernacle has waged War and he took the names Wayne Andrew and Ron and took the first letters of their name and it spells w-a-r-war and and of course I want you to know our war isn't against flesh and blood amen but it's against principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness in high places so you know it's we're nothing directed at any any of our brothers or sisters or friends or uh or anybody else or any other Church where our our enemy is the devil amen and so we we but we wage war and that's what we intended to do war on sin war on unbelief war on sickness war on every demon power we are here to wage war amen and we we have we have made the solemn act and declaration of war against the devil we're not having peace with him amen we're not giving up land for peace we're standing on that promise of God but um but he went on to say on the kingdom of hell that saw the bride realize that she is Anointed to accept what Eve turned down and what's these are sermon titles he said the bride realized he is Anointed to accept what he turned down this has made her cry out let's finish this for she is the anointed bright body of the Lord Jesus Christ and she is now feeling the effect of the vision as it Dawns on her that Satan is underestimated her for he cannot stop her from stepping into the mystery of the change amen I tell you what I I re I didn't think I could say it any better so I thought I'd just read what he said and he summed it up pretty well he goes on to say I truly believe the latter Glory of Eden and light Tabernacle be farther greater than the former you are truly an instrument of inspiration in the hand of the Lord to stir this Bride on into complete victory for that We Salute You amen so we so appreciate those words of encouragement from Brother Kalin today and also from Brother duet um and the eagle Ministry Tabernacle there and just believing that God who said I will restore will come by your way today with healing in his wings amen he's that kind of a God Amen aren't you glad to be serving the lord amen and just to know him and to have and experienced him and to have him in our presence is so so wonderful so we're looking today to the Lord to minister to us now we're going to go right onto the word now as we come close to the noon hour here in Louisiana and um as we begin to look in the scriptures we we are yes still dealing with the prophecy of Abraham and I'm I'm continuing to deal with this because remember um it's something that brother Branham would bring out almost every sermon and and preach entire series on and so I think it's worth us looking at and really taking a real uh in-depth thoughts about it because it is prophesying of the end time and what we're doing in this last day you see we see the Bible quite differently than others we see it as a prophecy and we we see ourselves in it and one service I'd like to just be able to take and and show you even the scriptures ever ever verse in the Bible speaks of Jesus Christ and so as we if it speaks of him then it also speaks of his work of redemption and you and so if you go and you read in the Bible and you miss seeing Christ in it go back and read it again he's there somewhere amen sister Bethany was telling me about uh listening to the um to all the the buildings of the Tabernacle and and the trapings and the you know just minute details of how that everything was to be and and all the anointing the clothes everything done in such a way and you know it it almost seems laborious but when you realize our God is a detailed God he seemed to ever detail of your life and so he doesn't just take up space in his Bible if he says something in his word it's for it was of course for them but it's even that that word of God continues living it's a Living Word so even though other Generations might have saw themselves in it it's written for you to see yourself in it so um today we're going to be be speaking on looking for Sarah because on the plains of memory here God came looking specifically now and he's looking for Sarah and and I want you to notice in this thing God comes his self if you notice this was the pre-incarnate Christ prefiguring what he would do in the last days and I love it when God takes personal interest in men's Affairs and I think God did that to us so much in our generation you know where he would tell names and addresses exactly where people lived exactly you know that the problem that they have and it was a God that could no ever detail of your life if he knew the past he would certainly know the present if he knows him present he certainly knows your future so it's a god that is a detailed God and here he comes down himself looking into the details he's looking for Sarah and and so this is again he has met with Abraham time after time but this time he's looking for Sarah where is Sarah thy wife so God has taken personal interests as I said I love it when he takes personal interest in man's Affair God didn't just send Angels looking for Sarah but although he was accompanied by them but he himself was looking for Sarah amen so God is present of course you know in the form of the Holy Ghost but angels are present also so when God comes looking you come in the form of the Holy Ghost but the angels of God are also here and they're also part but God comes himself notice we are here in the very finish and in the Finish God has not entrusted to finish with someone else he comes himself and you look at the anointing coming down of Revelation 10 it's a mighty angel and it's Christ coming down as his own messenger how could Christ be an angel he's not an angel but he is a messenger right so he comes as his own messenger he doesn't he doesn't come with an anointing of another angel or another this same anointing of of Gabriel and this is an anointing of wormwood or this is an Angelic anointing this is his own anointing and he comes down Christ as his own messenger and what he does he pledges himself amen he lifts his hand to heaven and swears by him that liveth forever and ever amen that I there's not going to be any more delay I've held things back but I'm no longer holding them back amen I I have waited for this day and for this time but now it is the hour to release to release all that I've held back for the end time I prophesied it in the scripture I've shown it in every verse I've identified it in the prophet's message but I tell you what I'm doing is that I am pledging myself amen I am standing as a guarantee swearing by his own self amen that I'm here to finish this work I'm here to perform what I said the word to do I'm not going to abandon the project amen I am not giving up on Heaven of Pride without spotter wrinkles I am looking for Sarah I am looking for that woman and I'm not going to leave her where I found her but I'm gonna change her to receive the promised son yeah so how does he come in Abraham's day he came in a tangible physical form manifesting God as a man but today he comes as a Holy Spirit and he uses flesh he uses the Flesh of redeemed men when he came and the fullness of his manifestation Abraham never got confused and made three Gods out of him neither did he tried to take away the deity of Christ and calling it two Lords let me say let me just say while we're here Jesus is not a lesser Lord he is the almighty God he is made was manifested in the body of the man of Christ Jesus Jesus is the only man that God will ever dwell in fully amen each one of us have the spirit of Christ by portion and remember the holy spirit is the spirit of Christ because he said if you don't have the spirit of Christ you're none of his so that's the Holy Spirit are you with me the very Spirit of Jesus a portion of him living in you shown them the day of Pentecost what did God do he divided himself and there he come in portions with every one of you to have a portion of deity a lick of fire in your own life hallelujah amen making together the fullness of the godhead bodily in a bright Lord Hallelujah amen now this was a calling forth of Sarah where is Sarah God came looking for her before he deals with son before he calls out what be he calls for sound and Sarah represents the bride and before the lot group goes into tribulation he comes looking for Sarah and before Sodom Burns and the Millennium comes when the world will be presence of sin he comes looking for Sarah because he must have a church ready to receive the promised son amen now it works as Faith Express I want to just share with you this quote and I I just want to I want this to become real to you he says God and this is part of his prayer to the Pentecostal Church of this day the restoration of the gifts May Lord those men maybe some of them present here some of them hearing the tape around the world may they realize that this is the calling out of the Bride not a Pentecostal message the Pentecostal message was to restore the gifts back to the church but this is the calling forth of the Bride another message that was to come just before Sodom was to be burned let them understand Dear God now notice so this message is the calling forth of the Bride other messages did other things Luther's message brought justification Wesley's message brought sanctification you see that this is a Revival brought gifts and baptisms in the Holy Spirit but this message is looking for sound amen it is the calling forth of the bride and it is calling her forth to the original Pentecost Hallelujah God was saying to Sarah I am going to restore you all your loss everything you've missed the child you didn't have come on now the thing you've been waiting on the thing you've been bereft of I'm going to restore that to you and you're gonna you're gonna be like you were before your womb dried up before your milk Maids were gone and then before all of your your Youth and vitality was gone I'm going to restore you back to the way you were but this time I'm not taking my church and going down with it I'm going up with it [Applause] Hallelujah now I want you to know this is no Azusa Street Pentecostal message has that led to organization it did not direct the people to become a virgin bride this message is to take the Barren Church and fill it with life and impregnate her with a long-awaited promised son Jesus Christ will be formed in the bright body and then that bright people will bring Jesus for that meeting in the air now this calling Boards of the bride was brother Brandon was speaking of is the original Pentecost the original Pentecostal message and not something different it is the same grain that was planted at Pentecost coming back to seed again you see it and of course you know to do that to come to see it means we've got to bake all the greenness out of us amen amen it means that the immaturity of the ages is baked out and now they and then and the grain is now mature as it was at Pentecost partial word has given way to the fullness of the word dips of the spirit has given way to the fullness of the Holy Ghost it is the word in power now as we're looking at this you see there's a lot of misunderstandings today when it comes to this and to some laying in the presence of the sun means no shouting no no emotion you know it's all dry no Revival no gifts of the Spirit no movement of the Holy Ghost it's the word now and it's supposed to be dry oh yes and for years have said it's immature to shout only babies do that it's immature to speak with Toms you know with the perfect word and with the full light it just burns all that old immaturity out but I want you to know it's not immaturity to speak in tongues and prophesy and to have gifts of the Spirit you can't be mature and complete without it it is not immature to shout the mature church will shout will rejoice and will laugh at the prospect of the promised son it is a mature Church who has healings at Miracles and signs and wonders Hallelujah I stopped at him Azusa Pentecostals are immature because they had gifts and spoke with tongues no they had matured past the lutherans you see before Pastor Lutheran stopped they had matured and the Methodist pollen to be able to speak with tongues that were more mature come on somebody that wasn't less mature that were more mature because they were more mature they spoke in other tongues and had gifts of the Spirit amen now what makes them Pentecostal babies is because you can't teach them Supernatural things you see they're immature because they jump up and down like a kid doing that to try and speak with tongues and refusing to walk in all the work amen that makes some babies but true and maturity and rightness is not a dry formal religion I mean that's a description of the dry dead blade tussle and Chuck but the life is in the grave now making the greenness and the immaturity out doesn't take away the power of God and signs and wonders amen making the greenness outbreaks that amen because she becomes the fullness of what she was at Pentecost which she was mature come on any Ministry without Divine Healing miracles signs and wonders is a green Ministry I'm not saying you're not grain now I'm saying you're immature a mature ministry will have the power of the resurrecting Christ in it a mature church will have gifts of the Spirit in it and the church church will have holy ghost power a mature church will have Divine Healing a mature church can be taught Supernatural things without causing carnal comparisons well my brother Tim this is the grain now and we we ain't nothing like we ain't nothing like the mezuzah bunch why was it you know we said well nothing like them Chuck out there we're just nothing like that well why was it then the prophet told us repetitively that the shuck looked so much like the grain that it would deceive the elect if it were possible hmm the shop looked so much like the real thing well we don't want to be like that they look more real than what baptism methodists message churches do amen they're a little bit closer up the ladder than what them are down in the past they're a little more mature somebody help me preach you see the grain is the full word and since every gift of the spirit comes interpretation prophecy healing Miracles Faith all of that that is listed in the Bible so since that is a part of the word then that's in the grave now in the Masterpiece message brother random said at the Harvest Time the seed is back in its original condition and you must have all the word in order to be seed somebody say all the word we got an open book there's none of it closed healing's not close to us Miracles does not close mysteries of God is not closed seven Thunders are not closed amen listen none of it's close to us it's all open to us so you see to the seed to the seed is back in its original condition and must have all the words in order to be the seed now you can't have half a seed it won't grow she has got to be the whole seed see that's why we're preaching a Full Gospel an open book none of it's closed amen it's got to be the whole seed it's got a man if I say I believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah I believe in speaking in tongues he said that's just part of the seed uh-huh but now there's added to that see see the life not just not the gifts the life of the gifts see what I mean we are at the end time brother so we have more than just gifts although that's part of the sea I just read it to you it's part of the sea but we got more than that because we got the life the personal presence of Christ the Holy Ghost himself who's appearing to Sarah here not an angel not not a secondary God Amen but God himself coming down now so brother Tim well we got the life not the gifts well you know people have used that you know to do away with the gifts of the Spirit you know that's like Rebecca reviews and the gifts of Isaac to become his bride you can't do that you can't refuse the engagement ringing and the things that identify you as bright these signs shall follow them that believe while other women wear jewelry too they got signs and wonders too listen but you've got to have it to be the bride of Christ if your believer's side follow the believer what shall I do with this Jesus called Christ he says what sinful man could there be today that could look in the face of the Bible and see if the Holy Spirit isn't The Interpreter of the word today making himself known by manifestations the promises of the gifts and things that he promised to do in this day Malachi 4 being fulfilled and all the rest of the scripture being fulfilled see it right here at the end time you don't need any man to interpret it it interprets itself it proves it's the message of the hour again and he would tell us and if God be with us where are the Miracles and he said if God be God where is his miracles if God's with us where is his miracles if God is with the Methodist Church why is the women wearing bobbed hair if God is with the Baptist Church why does the pastor still smoke cigarettes many of them why do they deny the power of God to heal the sick reads the dead and speak in tongues and interpret tongues and give some prophecy why do they still deny it is it God of the Old Testament the god of the new is still the same God so you said if God is with us if this is his appearing if this is Christ among us then where is miracles and we're declaring Christ is Among Us and so are his miracles hallelujah it's time that people wake up and see the hour and turn the corner from the past ages and become the bride she was at Pentecost get focused it's truly a serious time you don't listen this message came by the Supernatural and the only way this bride is raptured before the tribulation is by the supernatural so she's got to be a supernatural Church brother Branham told us he said that she nears him she will be a super Church amen I believe we are a super race a super Church come on now now so again time for people to wake up that's what the Seven Wonders were to do they were to wake the bride to the reality of the supernatural God as his voice uttered by seven angels to the prophet that was Supernatural it was no intellectual Revival that awoke the bride and I'll just tell you no intellectual Revival today will await the bride no seminars no intellectual teaching come on it'll take the anointing power Supernatural gospel Amen to bring the bride to awaken to who she is where are you Sarah you need an Awakening that this is your hour this is your time brother Branham himself realized that people were receiving it intellectually instead of laying in the presence of God and it ripened in their faith amen that you know Faith ought to be ripened healing ought to be ripened salvation ought to be ripened baptism of the Holy Ghost shouldn't be just a dip in the spirit and you dance and get it on your spirit realm and never on the soul amen it ought to be laying in the presence of the sun ripening bringing to maturity faith the power of God the mysteries of God come on it's not intellectual it is a supernatural Revival [Music] amen amen now notice this dating in 1965 11 28 God's only provided place of worship he says I believe the church is beginning to hear the message I'm beginning to understand it now he's just described in in pretext here um in context of this he just described it going beyond the curtain of time a supernatural event and he says I believe the churches are beginning to hear the message and beginning to understand it but friend listen we got to lay in the presence of the sun we've got to be ripened our faith isn't ripe intellectually we're hearing the message God gave us and seeing the signs he's so disproving it by the Bible it's there but oh how the church needs to lay in the present till it tenders up you know and gets sweet in the spirit so he can just bathe down something sometimes in speaking the message you get hard and you have to break it in like that because you've got to clench a nail to make it whole but when the church once gets it and the election is called out and separated then in the presence of God I know it'll be like the people was there referring to the curtain of time when it takes its Rapture away what was there was this is divine love this is the Holy Ghost so there's got to be a church walking in the fullness of the Holy Ghost something more that is intellectual Revival but the people walking in the power of God now let me just remind you of a of a phrase that my good friend who's now going to be to Glory brother Hildebrandt would say this message can't be passed on intellectually you know today sometimes you know we we think we're going to get it by study and that's the way that it's going to be if if we can just study study it all and get it all you know get it all figured out and you know just study it all and get it lined up well let me tell you that's man anointing it was man anointing under Luther that was calling for that kind of study but I want you to know this is an eagle anointing and it doesn't come by study it comes my experience with God breaking out of earth-bound conditions into Realms where all things are possible amen today we have wanted to dress the church up a little bit and refine it you know we want to we want to learn Behavior you know we have to teach a man to love his wife well brother if I got to teach you to love your wife there's something wrong if there isn't that love in your heart for your life I don't know all the teaching that I do is going to do it I didn't have to teach you to love her when she was your girlfriend did I you don't have to have seminars for me to teach you to love your wife or your girlfriend now you're supposed to love her now hey boy you're supposed to love her you don't buy her nice things make her happy take her out get her something to eat you know have a good time with it communicate I didn't have to teach that and I tell you you get men and women filled with the Holy Ghost you ain't gonna have to teach them to love their wife or a woman to obey her husband come on Amen especially when the Holy Ghost is anoint the word in your life it's gonna Quicken it and it ain't gonna be some counseling service out here in the back more that you learn that is not a learned behavior it becomes automatically why did I even make you love your enemy let alone your wife or husband [Music] now you know I I just want to say Godly instruction is good but that's all law you don't do this don't do that you know I'm going to give you this formula and I'll try this check this out send the Roses on her birthday and you know what she finds out I told you that she'll throw them roses back in your face if she finds out that was just something that was you know told to do somebody had to tell him to do that and he didn't come back from her heart from his heart she gonna throw that back in your face she don't want them roses cause brother Tim told you to get her son right amen she wants it because there's a Love in Your Heart A care that is there somebody with me today amen so you see you you know that's a whole thing it's it's not something that is learned the Holy Ghost is not a learned behavior I'm going to learn not to look at pornography so much and we're going to learn I'm going to teach you how a certain steps you know you take you know and and this is how that you know you treat the finances God gave you and and I I'm going to do all that listen that is not the gospel the gospel is the power of God under salvation amen you said well brother Tim we we need to teach our people how to manage their money how to manage their finances well I I admit sometimes Godly instruction can be appropriate but what we really need you want to hear it what we really need is the Holy Ghost that blasts out sin and takes greed out of our lives and holy ghost power that keeps envy and Covetous now and what that until whatever state you find yourself in that way if you are content that gain is not godliness but godliness with contempt is great gain [Music] it comes by the Holy Ghost that's cause you get in love with Jesus you ain't greedy no more from filthy Luca she ain't chasing the dollar everywhere and you're not running up your credit cards and living beyond your means you're not trying to keep up with the Joneses because of your covetousness good dose of the Holy Ghost secure that amen it'll make you content with such things as you have it may give your joy and the Lord instead of things you quit being Leo to see you trying to be rich and increase with goods and don't have need of God he's pushed out of your life you see the calling forth of the Bride is not an intellectual Revival it's a supernatural and it's power its power is not even learned behavior its power is in a changed life it is not a Reformation and that's the problem we're still trying to reform people you don't do that you don't do that you treat your wife this way and you treat your children this way and you do this and you do that you pay your ties and you come to church you're trying to reform them get the transforming power of the Holy Ghost and make a new creature out of them and to change their attitudes well anyway educating people into Bible truths is not the gospel the gospel is the power of God in the men's hearts that gives an attitude and a hunger for truth an appetite an attitude and hunger you see you see that's what God that that's what God is into this mouse that we're in is the first age started drifting and they started drifting you know by trying to dress the gospel up to make it appealing to their bosses and the rich man and whatever hasn't met in these little dim-ledded places and the Holy Spirit was replaced with intellectual conception divine revelation was replaced by educating people by knowledge and the the gospel became knowledge based instead of spirit based now in Moses day this is what it got Israel out of their Homeland all the way back to the time of Joseph you see the people didn't want the supernatural they saw Joseph a man who had dreams and visions and the voice of God was speaking to him and you can see the favor was upon his life and out of jealousy they sold him amen I I just say you know if you see the the hand of God in somebody's life don't don't don't try to be envious of them and jealous and stop it amen do everything you can join with it if this got him out of their promised land it's wind up getting them all the way down to Egypt of course God had a plan yes God had Provisions God made a way instead of all of the awful jealousies and everything that went on now so in Moses day that got him out they thought the Brethren that they would never have need for a man like that so why not just get rid of it I'm quoting now from Third Exodus he said that's what I same things happen today they because they think that because our churches has become an Alexa but that we got the best dress crowds the biggest organization the smartest ministers that we have no use for the holy spirit in the way it was back there that they are full in other words actions speak louder than words that they're seminaries and the brain of their being and they're coming together and discussing and standing are more able with their intellectual Minds to set a church in order better than what the Holy Spirit could do it they don't need it any longer it's something we don't need today the days of that has passed is that right we don't need the Holy Spirit to heal the sick we got doctors we don't need Holy Spirit to speak with tongues we're all intelligent people and when you do you take right from your framework the lifeline Jesus said to them Jews in this day having to read that the stone that was rejected is the Chief Cornerstone that all the building is set upon you see this is exactly where brother Branham was when when the the Seven Angels Came to him he came reopened the Bible to their work there was a Chief Cornerstone it was a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense but God was restoring the Capstone back to the church bringing up to completion amen that's what the seven Thunders do that's what the mysteries of God are to do is to bring you into maturity amen but God said But as God said to that Baron Sarah you know that she will be restored so he uses Israel now to that he brought out of Egypt to prophesy to us that God will restore Hallelujah in other words they're out of their land they got down there for the jealousy of the brothers they went into intellectualism but I will restore I'm going to bring it back by the supernatural it was not an intellectual Revival by the way that Moses brought the children of Israel out of Egypt it was by the supernatural it was by raining down pledge of Satan's kingdom come on he had Afflicted them enough now it was the devil's turn to be uplifted I'm going to tell you we've been Afflicted enough it's the devil's turn Hallelujah there's got to be a people that take the word and put it in their mouth and call flies down call please dial until the enemy says get out take your rapture and go praise the Lord now so God is what prophesies to us that in a day like this of Doom and Gloom and darkness that it shall be lied in the evening time and with the power of the light of that word the Bright Tree will bloom again Hallelujah I'm just telling you get ready to be restored [Music] [Applause] get ready you're in the greatest fire of restoration that there has ever been get ready for God to restore your home we saw your family restore your health how much minutes until our bodies are changed let's have that we're not asked to believe by little Divine Healing we're asked to believe by Massive total Divine Healing restoration of the bright trees but the evening light shall rise in the West to shine upon the word remember that's Revelation 10 1 put it up and you'll see Revelation 10 1 his face was as it were the son I'm telling no Shadow over it unveiled God the Mighty God unveiled before us somebody with me amen no Shadows a man his face as it were of the Sun and that's his countenance his feet as pillars of fire a Holy Ghost Church going forth conquered that's what that is amen but he said but the evening lights arise in the west to shine upon the word to ripen the fruit to bring the bright tree with the same signs wonders and fruits that they had at the beginning it shall be light in the evening time right oh the word will bring them bring forth its fruit in this season it shall not wither but it'll bring forth this fruit David said in its season and the same fruit it had at the beginning and I want you to know it's the season you think it's not a season for miracles and signs and wonders this is a season this is our restoration maybe they didn't have the right to believe for that in Luther's day or Wesley's day but we have the right God opened the buck for you and when he opened the book he opened every promise every word of God seconds amen he said well brother Jim here you're standing for gifts and signs and wonders listen I'm standing for every word [Applause] I'm not just wanting gifts and signs and wonders I want people that live right that are filled with the Holy Ghost a man that knows they're God so they can do exports come on not people do have a bunch of knowledge in their head and their butt saying message egg heads but people that know their god-self they know their position in Christ I can't seek it out [Applause] hmm it's like brother Tim I need to come to you so you can cast The Devil out of me why don't you do it was that just my job that's your job that's my job that's all of our jobs cat Satan out he gets in your home cast him out gets in your marriage catch him out I don't mean God get older this woman now so you got a dabble no no I can smell it I can see it I can hear it all over her she's got a devil I know that was enough don't you do that that ain't the way to cast out devils you humble yourself before the Lord become a servant love one another do what is right treat her like you would want to be treated make her a queen you want to be king you want to be a queen make him a king hello somebody else will be preaching next time but I am I am Pastor here so this gets a little pastoral just hold on now so you see the evening lights shall rise upon in the west to shine upon the word to ripen the fruit to bring the bright tree with the same signs and wonders and fruits that they had at the beginning it's heavy light in the evening time the word will bring bring forth his fruit in its season it will not wither but I bring the same fruits bring forth its fruit David said in his Seasons amen same fruit it had at the beginning what amen this right tree is going to have the same fruit that they had in the beginning now with this word and his predestinated stage as he's got it now and we see the words of being manifested what is it is a perfect Vindication that the coming of the Lord is at hand and the time that he said I will restore it saith the Lord all the kingdom canker worms all the methodists left and all that caterpillar is eating all this done is stripped it down but I will restore in the evening time well brother Tim we got all the Mystic troops restored we got it well let me just say about Doctrine Doctrine is not supposed to be dry informal and make Eggheads out of us return comes as the Holy Spirit come on the Apostle Paul put this scripture up First Corinthians 2 1 and I Brethren when I came to you now he was an egghead Pharisee of the Pharisees he had knowledge above them all he could have defined the law and why and where and how and all it comes and he was a Pharisee of the Pharisee but I came not with all my knowledge and Excellency of speech of my wisdom declaring to you the testimony of God that's not how I witness this gospel I didn't come and say well I'll tell you what you know I know more than the rest of you and I've been in this longer and I've got all the Mysteries down and everybody sit down and listen to me that's not what he said I came to Clarity you the testimony of God for I determined not to know anything among you but Jesus Christ saved Jesus Christ and him crucified this is what I wanted you to know I knew that I had met Jesus Hallelujah and I was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling and my testimony and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but but in demonstration of the spirit and Power that your faith should not rest or stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God that's where I want your faith amen that it's in the power of God our faith is not to be in well I know what the Thunders are and I know what serpent seed is and I know so therefore I got the Holy Ghost no you've got to know the power of God your faith cannot rest in knowing and understanding all the Mysteries you're just as much as those depends on tongues you're just sound embracing Tim tickling symbols amen but you see your light your faith is going to rest in the power of God Amen in first Thessalonians 1 and 5 for Our Gospel came not unto you in word only somebody say word only amen but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much assurance that's how the gospel came it didn't come in word only well we're a word bribe brother Tim we're word word word word word word word is a person it's a Holy Ghost it's not a message book it's not even a it's not even the Bible yes the Bible contains the word of God it's in written form I get that not denying that but that's not who the word before there was a Bible that was the word before there was a sermon but printed of brother Branham there was the word [Applause] come on and the Word was with God and the Word was God and it's the same holy ghost that we got today and when you get the Holy Ghost then you got the word not when you get intellectual learning but when you get the Holy Ghost then you the word got it backwards now Second Coming 1955 I know this 55 quote some people makes a difference to them but you can go uh you know I'm just going to say well this was when he was a prophet so when he was a prophet he said this the gospel is not going out and teaching the Bible by the way all of this can be found in other quotes after 63 6 all the way to 65. the gospel is not going out and teaching the Bible that isn't the gospel it is written in the scripture that the gospel didn't come through just the word only but through the power and demonstrations of the Holy Spirit The Gospel that is the word but the letter Kenneth the spirit-giveth life now a seed laying there laying here on the pulpit is just a seed until it dies and becomes germanized and dies it'll never do any anything so the seed the word has to be made manifest in order to be the gospel uh-huh it said in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God not depending on what the word was a word is the expression of a thought it has to be a thought before it can be a word so God in the beginning gave the thought of what it would be spoke the word for it to be we received the word and it produces what God thought it was the word is the gospel in seed form now if you ask me he said brother Brandon your country they have acorn trees that's an oak tree in case you don't know but if you would you give me an acre tree he said I'll give you an apron and I give you an acre you have an acorn tree potentially but it's in seed form you can't say absolutely you got it free until the seed has produced a tree well the preaching uh preaching the word is the acorn but making it live is the gospel that's right if he promised the Holy Spirit that's the word and receiving the holy spirit is making it live manifested if he promises Blessings by the word then accepting the word and producing what he said is the gospel going into all the world preach the gospel of every creature the next line is proof that just teaching the word wouldn't do it he said these signs have followed them that believe in my name they will cast out Devils evil spirits speak with new tongues take up servants drink the deadly things it would not harm them lay their hands on the sick they shall recover and now that's the gospel and Theology and teaching has substituted its place so you're not even teaching truly teaching the gospel or preaching the gospel unless it's manifested amen as Peter said in second Peter 1 21 for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man you see the prophets didn't think these things up amen they wasn't on their own this was not their intellect they had no right to ask for intellectual property rights come on but holy men spit of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost you see the mysteries of God that has been revealed to us I want you to understand it is not man's studied opinion it comes from the realm of the supernatural and when the seals were open night after night they were revealed by the angel of God amen now sure study has its place Paul admonished us to study to show ourselves a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed you said you read your Bible you should listen to tapes you should you should study to the word of God but it but remember it don't take ordinary study and thinking to make the book real it takes the operation of the Holy Ghost and that means it cannot be revealed itself to a special class of people who have the Holy Ghost amen so it'll take then then that because when you have the Holy Ghost your birthed into the Supernatural and it gives you a prophetic insight and it requires an ability to hear from God and it requires Supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse with verse though that's good but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know now that's why we need more than study we need an outpouring of the Holy Ghost the message I'm just going to say some things here the message has been studied and tinkered with men have added their own ideas and opinions to it until the car that brother Branham left running that would drive down to the power of God that took away sin desire amen we're told it it don't do that no more you don't have that kind of experience that takes away sin desires you know you just kind of got to grow into some kind of token life out here somewhere that that held out like a carrot in front of a goats that you never get because you're not going to get it that way it comes by birth it comes by the burden of sin out of your life amen that's right sure you grow in the life of God I'm not trying to do it away with that but what I'm saying is you've got to have that birth that cleanses sin out of life it's not something you're just going to get over it's something that's got to be dealt with that's why we have altar calls deal with it amen sometimes you want me to pray for you I didn't do the seven I mean you get down you talk to God you cry it out You Weep your way to Calvary you repent you get where you're more sorry than you just sorry you got caught at something you get more sorry than oh it's it's bad for my health it's not going to be good for marriages it's not good for my home it's got to be more than that it's got to be a I hate sin [Applause] amen my desires have to be changed I don't want it no more this is not a a-conscious well we take this step and this step we're going to grow into where we don't drink alcohol no more that that you'll fall off the wagon doing that you'll be always there tempted on every hand you know I still the desire is there but if God ever Burns that sin desire out of your life you won't want that old things have passed away and behold All Things become new are you with me amen but we you know we we again you know today we we would we had a car that was left running that would drive down to the power of the blood that took away sin desires you know we're we're told that we God don't do it that way no more we just need to Tinker with it some more and one day hope will grow out of our sins you know that car would would drive down to Divine Healing amen and now we're told for the days for the use of that car is over it's just a shiny something that sins that sits in a museum and and now it's um you know just a shiny something that we read about what God used to do and what this car once did it wanted to run this race Mayan South Africa that was great healings and miracles and and over there and and then the others so many come to Christ and it bound maniacs and you know we were eating all about it and we got a car in the museum because now that car's antique but these cars today we got a new model it's not filled with psychology because the car brother Brandon drove you know just didn't I don't know how the bells and whistles of the new one we modernized the new one until it's so dead so dead the horn won't even blow remember that there were there were two cars he were talking about both had worked high octane gasoline bill High okay let me tell you this Bible is how to amen it is it's got power in it don't you believe that but you can lay it on somebody that's dead it won't make them alive you can slay it on somebody that is sick it won't heal them but you ever let the spirit come down upon the word like Isaiah 53 that says I was wounded for your transgressions I was bruised for your iniquity and the Holy Spirit come down upon that and ignite it to you you walk out of here Shield or saved or whatever the need is [Applause] now but you know we want the latest bells and whistles you know that those skin seats and the diamond studded steering wheels but it has no spark no life no Dynamics so let's guess what your gasoline might as well be water all the doctrine in the world might as well be water unless the holy spirit is there to Quicken it well you know the other car wasn't so polished but it would run two cars one Ghost Skin it's Diamond studded wouldn't go had to push it off the assembly line but it wouldn't move it's just for a display but you see but you see the island would dry you see it would run you said well brother Tim what you folks are driving his way too noisy we like it quiet but you see dead cars don't go anywhere they're for the museum amen well I don't like it brother Tim that's just too much horn blowing over the evening like Tabernacle too much cranking on the Pistons I don't like that shouting and dancing in the spirit but this card does more than that amen it's chock full of the word I tell you it's filled with jet fuel Hallelujah when we need it it drove down to Divine Healing and healed sister Atlanta amen yeah she blew the horn shouting all over the building shouted the glory to God but it went somewhere amen she went back the next day and pronounced cancer free somebody help me preach I don't like these prayer lines brother Tim too much cranking on the the Piston the too much horn blowing does it does that go anywhere well for Mariah amen a little girl who lost all her hair with alopecia she went to the prayer line and that demon was cursed and all her hair grew back [Applause] I told you he said God will restore amen I told you this fire will dry Hallelujah well I don't like those odds are called well we just gotta we just gotta email today with a testimony from a young brother gershomara I think he's from Indiana said I want to thank the Lord for moving and filling me with his holy spirit on Sunday morning Hallelujah it'll drive [Applause] that's the finish line well what about delivered some alcohol drugs and tobacco yes it will drive down to that too amen you know that gaming and porn is an addiction too it's a drug and oh now we're having to give classes on it how to deal with it well I tell you this car that we're driving it leaves gaming and pouring in the dust and so far behind us you can't see it anymore in the rear view mirror that life is past and it's in the blood of Jesus Christ and men and women are overcomer this is not a dead a motionless religion this truth this Doctrine comes as rain amen it's not dry it comes as rain Deuteronomy 32 and verse 2 my Doctrine shall drop is the rain my speech shall distill is the do as a small Reign upon the tender herb as it showers upon the grass but it comes as a refreshing you see it's not a drought a man it don't dry you up it gets you follow the moisture of the Holy Ghost amen bringing you in the power of the word and burning the greennessy and maturity out of your life the anointed word is not a dry and dead theology it's the last rain it's the outpouring of the holy spirit that brings the weed To The Head and the full maturity now things that are to be brother Branham told us he said that that we know that this is the day of salvation where God is calling men from the world from a life of sin unto life of service and in the day that God has poured out his Spirit from on high great signs and wonders are to accompany the ministry of this day this is when the farmer and latter rain are falling together and we know that there is supposed to be great signs and wonders which in many great denominations this is turned down now again it's the weed age that's where we're at let me just tell you what the grain is to be like the weed Age The Grain age it's the wheat age friends last a week There's a Ministry on the earth that's just like the one that went into the ground back Yonder the beginning a real Pentecostal experience oh yes we must lay in the presence of the sun it's the full light that's him Revelation 10 I already showed you his face was as it were the Sun brother Branham tells us in restoration the bride tree but the evening light shall rise in the west to shine upon the word to ripen the fruit to bring forth the bright tree with the same signs and wonders and fruits that they had at the beginning it shall be light in the evening time write all the words and will bring forth is fruit in its season it shall not wither it'll bring forth its fruit David said in its season amen same fruit it had at the beginning now with his word in his predestinated stage as he got it now we see the words all being manifested what is it's a perfect Vindication that the coming of the Lord is at hand he said I will restore so you see and and then he said you know I've been listening to the Pentecostal friends and he said my brethren there there predicted a sweeping Revival coming now listen they got one it was a charismatic Revival there's now not just a couple of million Pentecostals there's 500 there's a half a billion there's a half a billion Pentecostals now so you see they've had a sweep and revive but it was an intellectual Revival are you with me but he said he said now I think our our Revelation should must be scriptural and then we know it's right if it's scripture is from the Lord and I'm beginning to believe that that's right there's coming a ripening time for the evening fruits amen so well there ain't nothing more coming brother Tim he said I beginning to believe that what they said is actually right that there is to accommodate ripening time for evening fruits Hallelujah a maturity can't you see I mean maybe you're not tying it all together but Sarah had reached the point come on where that where that he was now the season and the time for the word to be made manifest and her faith had to be ripened [Applause] she had to start believing hey mama if I can't believe a Divine Healing how am I going to believe for a body change if I can't believe that God can save a soul from sin how can I believe he will heal a body from sickness now the last thing that the church is going to see brother Branham says and then message investment the last thing the church is going to see is Christ manifesting in his fullness in in his power in fullness in his church just before the fire falls is everybody with me on page amen the last thing so the last thing is God's coming in the flesh now not into one man all one man's scriptures have been fulfilled oh brother Tim you record you you you reject this man you're rejecting Christ nonsense amen all one man's scriptures have been fulfilled I'm not looking for another leader to rise up I'm not trying to be the next Joshua or the next Moses on the next you know I you know that was a whole problem when when I was a young preacher they sent out tracks around you know newsletters and one now is is that alley Hugh and the other is uh Joshua and the other is Jay Hugh and the other you know he's going to go after the the Harlot church and this one and they had all these men with their pictures of all that they were going to be and it turned out to be drunks and alcoholics and got their own message and went out and deceived people and caused train wrecks everywhere well brother Tim you need to turn the corner I ain't following your corner there's a prophet turn the corner I ain't looking for another one I ain't trying to be the next one amen but I am saying there is a church body there is a bride of Christ around the world it ain't it even like Tabernacle you don't have to come here to get it it ain't about us it's about him oh one man's scriptures have been fulfilled we're not looking for another great one with visions and miracles and this and that and the other this is a body Ministry these signs shall follow them that believe thank you I hope you get it amen now brother Brandon said there's some bee uh a great big outpouring again 63. a big outpouring of the spirit yes sir to grab that church take her into the skies what a big outpouring of the spirit not an intellectual Revival I'm not pouring of the Holy Ghost that's what we need come on amen that's how we need we if you want to study study to get filled with the Holy Ghost study to get filled with the presence of God's steady until sin is put out the back in the background and all you see is Jesus [Music] [Applause] hope you're getting me amen he said brother Branham said and what shall I do with Jesus called Christ God's Little Flock that believes the word its mechanics is ready too it's ready for the Dynamics to set into fire with the Holy Ghost fear not little flock it's God's will to give you the kingdom the Holy Ghost somebody say it holy ghost we'll strike a little church that's come out of the world women that wears long hair that's right to prove they are separated from the world it's going to strike those who are obedient to the word of God Amen he tells again and is your life worthy of the gospel God is going to send another shaking across the country because there's somebody still out there and I say oh God's father would even like Tabernacle slim is shaking amen that shakes sin out that exposes wrong that brings a word into full preeminence amen well there's no hope for Revival brother Tim it's all over 1963 the token I'm looking for the time of a Break Forth of the spirit of God in this last day that we're living in for another surge of the Holy Spirit into the church for a Rapture and Faith just before it comes and everything is sitting straight in order for that and I believe that we know at the time that the word should have preeminence well what about some more brother Tim well he said in perfect Faith did you hear that perfect faith Sarah had imperfect faith she had an aimed at the wrong thing she just believed Hagar could do it and Abraham could do it and come on people said well brother Branham did and Christ didn't that but I don't know about me let me tell you Sarah your heart's got to be turned [Applause] you got to start believing for your miracle you gotta start peeking to your Mountain your Mountain has got to hear your voice it's got to be your voice I can't do it for you it's got to be your voice now you say to that mountain you need to start saying to that thing that's been bothering you you devil you're not holding me anymore I am a blood wash blood bump Sutter daughter the Living God and I'm not given one inch to you I'm speaking to you in the name of the Lord I will walk in Victory I will walk in love I will walk in within the grace of God I will be like Enoch and I walk with God that I am not he said I'm trying to hit the church into a place where we could really see Apostolic times moving Among Us that's what we all hunger it's just laying right the door but we want to see more of it we see it but we want to see more of it how many would say that we see it but we want to see more of it don't stop God don't stop the flow we wanted such a flow that'll be a help to us and it'll flow out to others that's what we wanted to do amen oh you say brother dear my eye that you know all of that's passing that's just Pentecostalism it's not Pentecostalism hey Manny I'll tell you what it is the prophet of God said the reason I do believe that when the bride is called it and elected and said in the Book of Life there will come a sound from Heaven that it takes such a baptism of the Holy Spirit into that bride that I take her from the earth in Rapture Grace Hallelujah that's what we ought to be looking for amen that's what we ought to be expecting a sound from heaven and take such a baptism of the Holy Spirit into that bride Hallelujah Oh my he said he said in the world is the Fallen apart it seems like there's a drying out of the churches hardly can find the church anywhere that's alive but the word and with the spirit of God and great things taking place like it was not long ago don't sound like it's supposed to be in Decline sounds like we ought to be expecting that come on say well we got the doctrine it's rain then if it's true Doctrine it's rain it's the Holy Ghost it's being poured out on All Flesh and what does it do when it's poured out my sons and my daughters shall prophesy my young man will see Visions my old men will dream dreams in that day I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh somebody help me everybody you know that's the truth that's what God promised that's what God's doing amen you see the atmosphere has got to be right for it this is where Sarah was she was there in the wrong atmosphere said brother Tim atmosphere has nothing to do with that we don't want no atmosphere for the Holy Ghost well you just be that way I want it well we want a atmosphere for maturity well you know to be mature okay well that atmosphere then will bring gifts and signs and wonders and Holy Ghost and power of God and all of that but let me tell you as I bring this down to close that the atmosphere for this is right is right it's the right atmosphere you know what we try to do in our services is create an atmosphere because it's when the in the atmosphere things can happen when there's no atmosphere forward Faith isn't there amen healing isn't there Miracles ain't there it has to be an atmosphere for it are you with me so you know now I I don't even have time to get into this but maybe I'll do it in another service but if you took a glimpse down at Sodom just for a moment you would see Satan becoming incarnate in a people they're so full of the depth they will mock the righteous and abuse angels they hate righteousness they hate even the laws of God they don't even want his name mentioned this is the most anti-god nation that we have ever had to have given over to the devil they're over to reprobate Minds Sodom has increased in my generation from one percent of the population identifying this homosexual to nearly one out of four of those who are in Generation Z ages 18 to 25 now identify as homosexual to transgender one of them you know and the rest are okay with it I said the rest are okay with even those in my generation are okay with you you see it's your freedom to do so that was not American freedom American Freedom was not that you see that's democracy all sales and no anchor so they just keep on going you know where you're going to liberate everything and everything every devil in hell is coming out the closet to the point they want perverts and and everything else you you know um brother EJ tried to call me the other day and and and I learned about it from brother Timothy that one of our one of our school resource officers in Shreveport now he come and identified as a fox he's a fox not a man at all not a woman he's a fox well I don't want the fox in my chicken coop guarding my hen house looking after my kids come on somebody that's not what you do amen that's insanity can you can you imagine somebody putting down for their gender or Fox a cat that's insanity where we laughing about it this morning and think how ridiculous this but it's stupid it's so somebody is and now insane amen now brother Branham told us in the message of anointed one's end time he said there are three things that lay before you and see if this ain't prophecy first the world is in his solemn condition now across the world right now people are laughing at them stupid Americans well we are stupid go ahead and laugh but go around and look around the world is in a Sodom condition Jesus said it would happen look at the perversion are women trying to act like men are men trying to act like women sissified rotten filthy Lowdown devil possessed and don't know it and the Bible said it would happen and that's where it's at and you don't think I'll preach against it huh you missed it amen you missed it I will and you ought to be thankful for it amen we don't want our girls looking like men taking a hair looking like men we don't want our boys looking like women come on we want Holiness righteousness that's what the gospel produces amen so you see the world is in a silent condition Jesus said it would happen look at the perversion I'll tell you we ought to stay in our home it stops here it ain't welcome in a home it ain't welcome in our church [Applause] so you know you know we we don't want it in our church she said brother Tim you you don't want gays in your church yeah I want them to come I want the gay that were lesbian transverse side to every one of them come down they ain't no different than a prostitute [Applause] I want the prostitute to come but I don't want to remain prostitutes and gay and lesbian and this and that I want them to find Jesus I want them to find a change in their life that's what I wanted to find I want to see the power of God go forth and the salvation Hallelujah you say you don't love them yeah I love them I love them enough to say that sin that's wrong is an evil spirit but we got hope for you there is Mercy there is Grace we were just at a meeting that I preached I think it was when I preached there's a boy with a man bun I don't know I don't know how you get a man bun I had never seen a man bun they call him a man bun but that ain't a man bun man don't have buns that was a man with a woman bun you know you're confused no man bun there but anyway he came he'd been you know poor guy you know come up and had a soft voice and you know it wasn't wasn't you know it wasn't really a manly voice and people began to tell him he was he was really a girl he began to believe that lie took him out of the house and God took him out of church took him away from his family took him in the life of sin but you see he heard that there was a meeting going on and that there was hope for people like him and prophecy went forth that called him to an altar amen and before that he left from there that man with the girl bun gay men got to change in his life was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and sent out a testimony I'm free I'm delivered I'm saved that the power of God under salvation that's the gospel that we preach that's the hope that we offer and when the Holy Ghost comes here to make a man a man and a woman a woman [Music] but secondly it's the hour for Janice and gembridge so sure there's impersonators there's always been impersonators and certainly he was thirdly it's at the same out that the son of man is being revealed Hallelujah so in the very hour that the world is in the Sodom condition in the very hour where there are hypocrites everywhere impersonating real true Christianity if somebody helping me preach now amen that I want you to know thirdly it is the same hour that the son of man is revealed himself Christ's coming in human flesh that's what we ought to look for today we ought to look for Christ Among Us the son of man the word of God to be manifested in my flesh and your flesh let's stand together and worship God Hallelujah blessed be the name of
