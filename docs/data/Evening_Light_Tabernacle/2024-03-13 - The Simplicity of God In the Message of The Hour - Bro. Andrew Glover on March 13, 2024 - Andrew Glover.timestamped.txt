[37:22] oddballs but Lord we've been trained to
[37:25] believe in the Supernatural we've been
[37:27] taught that there is a supernatural host
[37:29] that accompanies this message and Lord
[37:31] we believe that wherever this message is
[37:33] preached the supernatural will take
[37:35] place so father as We Gather here

[37:51] Lord you promised us a supernatural
[37:53] manifestation now father you see every
[37:55] hand that was raised here tonight behind
[37:57] that hand there is a need and whether it
[37:59] be a sickness oh God or a discouragement
[38:01] in the spirit whatever it may be Lord I
[38:04] know that you're more than able to come
[38:05] in this meeting tonight and by your word
[38:07] you're able to take that two-edged sword
[38:09] and cut between the soul and the spirit
[38:12] you're able to cut between the joints in
[38:13] the tomorrow for lord your Prophet
[38:15] taught us that the sword of Hebrews 4 is
[38:18] like a surgeon's knife and Lord we know
[38:20] Lord how cautious that a surgeon has to
[38:22] be when he handles that knife but Lord

[40:14] You' be proud of these men of God the
[40:16] word they brought in these meetings
[40:17] brother Tim there in Arkansas just the
[40:19] Lord used him in a supernatural way to
[40:21] bless the church there and then brother
[40:23] Timothy this weekend just poured his
[40:24] heart out and preached the power of this
[40:26] word and amen ain't it good to be
[40:28] identified with men that preach this
[40:29] message amen and they'll stand for this
[40:31] message and nothing else amen we sure
[40:34] appreciate these men of God and we
[40:35] tonight just want to take a few moments
[40:37] here with you in the scripture from the
[40:39] book of Isaiah the 53rd chapter and then
[40:41] we're also going to look at Matthew
[40:43] chapter 11 Isaiah 53 and verse number
[40:47] one the Bible here says who hath
[40:50] believed I
[40:52] report and to whom is the arm of the
[40:55] Lord revealed now I'm taking this from
[40:58] God hiding himself in Simplicity
[41:00] revealing himself in the same brother BR
[41:02] says in other words if you have believed
[41:05] our report then the arm of the Lord has
[41:08] been revealed so we asked a question who
[41:11] hath believed our report and he answers
[41:14] the question with a question that if you
[41:16] believe the report then the arm of the
[41:19] Lord is revealed somebody say revealed
[41:22] now in Matthew 11 and verse 25 St
[41:25] Matthew 11 and verse number
[41:28] 25 uh those of you will know I'm taking
[41:31] these scriptures I'm borrowing them from
[41:32] Brother bram's sermon God hiding himself
[41:35] in Simplicity then revealing himself in
[41:37] the same and in Matthew 11 and verse
[41:41] 25 the Bible here says at the time Jesus
[41:46] answered and said I thank thee oh Father
[41:49] Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou
[41:52] Hast hid these things from the wise and
[41:55] prudent and Hast revealed them them unto
[41:57] babes now the carnal mind would think
[42:00] that would be the other way that you've
[42:02] hid these things from babes and have
[42:04] revealed them to the wise and prudent
[42:06] but here he says I've hid him from the
[42:08] wise and prudent but has revealed them
[42:10] unto babes even so father for it for so
[42:14] it seemed good in thy sight and all
[42:17] things are delivered unto me of my
[42:18] father and no man knoweth the son but
[42:20] the father neither knoweth any man the
[42:22] father save the son and he to whomsoever
[42:25] the son Will will reveal him amen we ask
[42:29] the Lord this evening to add the
[42:30] blessing to the reading of his word as
[42:32] you can have your seats here this
[42:33] afternoon I want to by the help of the
[42:35] Lord for just a few moments tonight if I
[42:37] would speak to here if I title this
[42:39] tonight I want to talk to you on the
[42:41] Simplicity of God in the message of the
[42:44] hour see the Simplicity of God in the
[42:47] message of the hour I've just recently
[42:49] uh been a burden on my heart and started
[42:51] back through the seven seal book and
[42:53] tonight just taking a portion of this
[42:55] from God hiding himself in simplicity
[42:57] brother reads those two scriptures and
[42:59] says now can you catch those two
[43:00] scriptures who has believed I report and
[43:04] to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed
[43:07] he said then Jesus thank God that he had
[43:09] hid the mysteries from the wise and
[43:11] prudent but would reveal it to babes
[43:14] such as would learn for it seemed good
[43:17] to God to do that now when you look here
[43:19] at this word revealed in the Greek that
[43:21] word revealed it means to uncover it
[43:24] means to lay open what has been veiled
[43:26] amen or covered up it is to disclose to
[43:29] make be to make known to make manifest
[43:31] to disclose what before amen was unknown
[43:35] so when something is revealed at one
[43:37] time it was covered it was disclosed it
[43:39] was veiled but when it is open then the
[43:42] beholder can see it amen in all of its
[43:45] beauty and all of its power now brother
[43:47] BR preaching there and he's opening the
[43:48] series there on the seven seal and he in
[43:50] the seven seal book in paragraph 164 of
[43:53] God hiding himself in Simplicity says
[43:55] now when God is just about to do
[43:57] something to deliver his people God
[43:59] sends a message to the people and it's
[44:02] so simple he said as well as catching
[44:05] the breaking of these seals we'll catch
[44:06] it there he said that was my purpose of
[44:08] bringing this first that we find out
[44:11] that the breaking of those seals is so
[44:13] simple amen that the smart will miss it
[44:15] a million miles he said see I hope that
[44:18] God anoints me for it see it just goes
[44:20] over the top he said but that's the
[44:22] reason I thought this message this
[44:23] morning would be appropriate Amen to lay
[44:26] a foundation of the Simplicity of God to
[44:29] see how that God hides himself in
[44:31] simplicity so here the prophet of God is
[44:33] saying that the opening of the word
[44:35] which we believe has come open amen the
[44:38] foundation of it is not education the
[44:40] foundation of it is not intellectualism
[44:43] but the foundation of the opening of the
[44:45] word amen is a foundation of Simplicity
[44:48] now you all know that John 16:13 says
[44:50] how be it when he the spirit of Truth is
[44:53] come amen he will guide you into all
[44:55] truth he will not speak speak of himself
[44:58] but whatsoever he shall hear that shall
[45:00] he speak amen and he will show you
[45:02] things to come how many can say tonight
[45:04] be on the shadow of a doubt I know that
[45:06] I have the spirit of Truth Amen on the
[45:09] inside of my heart now the prophet of
[45:11] God said when the new birth comes he
[45:13] said comes in it cannot come until
[45:14] there's a death first amen and people
[45:17] don't want to die they don't want the
[45:19] simple leadings of the Holy Spirit he
[45:21] said they want to take their own
[45:22] thinking of it but you cannot thank your
[45:24] own faults amen you've got to thank his
[45:27] thought so here amen is the foundation
[45:29] of the greatest Revelations that's going
[45:31] to come from the word amen is a
[45:33] foundation of Simplicity and a prophet
[45:36] says now let this mind that was in
[45:38] Christ be in you he said see he thanks
[45:41] God's thoughts and he brings God's
[45:43] blessing seek God's power to you it'll
[45:45] make a mess out of you as far as the
[45:47] world is concerned amen but it'll bring
[45:49] new life it'll bring resurrecting life
[45:52] it'll bring new thoughts it'll bring a
[45:54] new person it'll bring a new Faith it'll
[45:56] bring you amen from Death unto life amen
[45:59] can I say that what we believe as the
[46:01] Revelation amen of Jesus Christ is not a
[46:04] dead work amen it's not a dead
[46:07] Revelation it's not a powerless religion
[46:09] amen but I believe that it is have the
[46:11] power Amen to bring a new faith in the
[46:13] church I believe it has the power to
[46:15] turn sadness into Joy amen I believe it
[46:18] has the power to turn defeat into
[46:20] Victory I believe it has the power to
[46:22] turn confusion amen into clear
[46:25] understanding because it's not coming
[46:26] coming from the confusion of Education
[46:29] it is coming from the spirit of Truth
[46:30] now brother B prayed this he prayed
[46:32] actually his prayer amen is that God
[46:35] would raise up a simple people he said
[46:38] now said may your people that's called
[46:40] by your name may they be revived again
[46:42] he said bring us back to oldtime
[46:44] Pentecostal meetings Lord where the Holy
[46:46] Spirit can have the RightWay may we lay
[46:49] aside all of our learnings and just be
[46:51] simple people amen that is led by the
[46:54] holy spirit for we realize amen that
[46:57] this is the way he leads Amen in the way
[47:00] of simplicity so when God made man he
[47:02] did not make man amen to rely upon
[47:05] himself amen for his leadership but he
[47:08] made man to completely rely upon god
[47:10] brother said that's the reason we're
[47:12] liking the Lambs or Sheep amen is a
[47:14] sheep cannot lead himself he has to have
[47:17] a leader and the holy spirit amen is
[47:20] supposed to lead us see so man is made
[47:22] that way now I want you to catch this
[47:24] church God made all of his works so
[47:27] simple amen that the simple could
[47:29] understand it and God makes himself
[47:31] simple with the simple in order to be
[47:34] understood by the simple amen that's a
[47:36] mouthful God the Mighty God makes
[47:38] himself simple and identifies himself
[47:41] with the simple Amen in order to be
[47:43] understood by the simple brother BR says
[47:45] when we do is we walk over the simple
[47:47] things amen looking for God when we
[47:50] ought to look at the simple things and
[47:52] we can see God in the nature right we
[47:54] can see him in the sun we can see him in
[47:56] the tree we we can see him in his
[47:58] Universe right we can see him in his
[48:00] word amen and we can see him in his
[48:02] people now the Bible speaks of a Time
[48:05] amen of a falling away or a turning back
[48:07] or a departing from the revealed truth
[48:09] and I'll just say this I believe amen it
[48:12] will be a people who are able or not
[48:14] able rather or they will simply lose
[48:16] their ability Amen to follow the simple
[48:19] leadership of the Holy Ghost that has
[48:21] been sent into this generation Jesus
[48:24] said to his disciples you know what he
[48:25] said to them he said said follow me in
[48:28] Matthew chapter or rather Luke 9 he said
[48:30] If any man will come after me Amen Let
[48:32] Him deny
[48:34] himself and take up his cross and follow
[48:37] me now watch this word follow means to
[48:40] follow one who proceeds Amen to join him
[48:43] as an attendant to accompany him to join
[48:46] one as a disciple Amen to become or be
[48:48] his disciple side with his party and the
[48:51] prophet of God said it very beautiful he
[48:53] said what we must follow him is the only
[48:55] way to have eternal life see so the
[48:58] leadership of God Amen is to follow the
[49:01] word of the hour the Vindicated word of
[49:04] the hour by the Holy Ghost now you all
[49:06] believe here tonight that you are the
[49:08] sons of God right you're the children of
[49:10] God see amen then the Bible tells us
[49:12] that the Son of God Amen was led by the
[49:15] spirit and it also says amen that the
[49:17] sons of God are led by the spirit as
[49:19] well in Matthew chapter rather Luke
[49:21] again chapter 4 ver1 I'll get my Matthew
[49:23] and Luke straight in a minute amen Luke
[49:25] chapter 4 ver1 the Bible said that that
[49:26] Jesus being full amen of the Holy Ghost
[49:29] returned from Jordan amen and was led by
[49:32] the spirit Into the Wilderness in Romans
[49:34] 8:14 the Bible said as many as are led
[49:36] by the spirit of God Amen they are the
[49:39] sons of God said the Bible speaks and
[49:42] says that it's his holy spirit that
[49:44] leads you amen then the same holy spirit
[49:46] that led Simeon to believe that is the
[49:49] same holy spirit that lead you Amen to
[49:52] believe in Divine Healing amen there's
[49:54] no two holy spirits amen the same holy
[49:58] ghost that led Simeon Amen to believe
[50:00] that God was a God who keeps his word he
[50:03] is a God that no matter how dark it gets
[50:05] no matter amen how many walks away God
[50:07] will not make a promise and then back
[50:09] off of that promise but if God made you
[50:11] a promise he will bankrupt Heaven amen
[50:14] before he lets one of those promises
[50:16] fail you come on church I think it's
[50:18] time to remember amen that the Holy
[50:20] Ghost wasn't one for the apostles and
[50:22] brother Bram got one and this one got
[50:23] another one amen but it's the same Holy
[50:25] Ghost amen from Genesis to Revelation
[50:28] amen from 47 to 65 amen it is the Holy
[50:32] Ghost of God coming into the church amen
[50:35] to strip the church away from the ideas
[50:37] of Education the complications of
[50:39] religion and to come back to the
[50:41] Simplicity amen the god leading his
[50:44] church now amen when you start talking
[50:46] about the Holy Ghost amen how can we not
[50:48] talk about the power of the Holy Ghost
[50:51] amen how many agree the Holy Ghost has
[50:52] got power it's got power to save it's
[50:56] got got power to heal it's got power to
[50:58] deliver it's got power to cast out
[51:00] Devils it's got power to reveal the
[51:02] secrets of hearts come on Church the
[51:04] Holy Ghost is a powerful Holy Ghost and
[51:07] the prophet of God said then that's what
[51:08] power is in the church now amen but it
[51:11] is controlled by a law see and that law
[51:13] is not keeping a bunch of carnal
[51:15] Commandments but it's a law of faith for
[51:17] Jesus said amen all things are possible
[51:20] to them that believe how many Believers
[51:22] have I got here amen and if you can
[51:24] believe it now listen if you you can
[51:27] believe it then whatever God will lead
[51:29] your soul to believe that is yours amen
[51:32] if you can believe it then whatever God
[51:35] Amen will lead your soul to believe that
[51:37] is yours every place the soul of your
[51:39] foot can set up on by faith amen God
[51:42] gives it to you it's yours you possess
[51:44] it if you can find the key to this law
[51:47] of Faith amen that opens it to you you
[51:50] see what I mean if you are a son of God
[51:52] you are a daughter of God Amen that
[51:54] never leaves you amen it's with you all
[51:57] the time amen but your faith can get
[51:59] away from it but it's still there then I
[52:01] love that because amen it's not just on
[52:03] my good days amen that the Holy Ghost is
[52:06] leading me it's not when I feel like the
[52:08] Holy Ghost is leading me it's not when I
[52:10] can sense the Holy Ghost is leading me
[52:13] amen but there is a law of Faith Amen in
[52:15] the soul of a Believer amen and when
[52:18] you're on the mountain he will lead you
[52:20] when you're in the valley he will lead
[52:21] you when you're in the wilderness he
[52:23] will lead you amen when you're sick he
[52:25] will lead you when you're well he will
[52:27] lead you listen I don't believe it's
[52:29] time to back off amen of the leadership
[52:32] of the Holy Ghost and go find a new
[52:34] leader I think if there's ever been a
[52:35] time to come back to the leadership of
[52:38] the spirit of truth and the message of
[52:40] the hour I say Now's the Time to do it
[52:43] amen you may get away from it but it
[52:45] don't get away from you amen then listen
[52:48] if the Lord leads you to believe it amen
[52:50] then you got a right to believe it and
[52:52] you got a right to possess it if God
[52:54] come on church if God leads in a service
[52:57] to believe for a miracle you've got a
[52:59] right to believe for that miracle if God
[53:01] leads you to believe for a healing you
[53:03] got a right to believe for that healing
[53:05] if God leads you to believe for the
[53:06] Salvation of a prodal you got a right to
[53:09] believe that we talk a lot about putting
[53:11] our foot Amen on the head of the devil
[53:13] and we believe in that don't we amen but
[53:15] I think it's time we turn that from the
[53:17] negative to the positive amen we put our
[53:19] foot on the head of the devil amen but
[53:21] now I think it's time to make some
[53:22] footsteps amen as possession in the land
[53:26] of in inance to this Joshua generation
[53:28] listen we've not been called Amen to
[53:30] come up to the border of the land and
[53:32] back off and say well it's too hard or
[53:35] or it's to this or it's to that but we
[53:37] have been anointed by the message of the
[53:39] hour amen the opening of the word has
[53:41] placed an anointing upon the church to
[53:43] move into every promise that God has
[53:46] made amen I love the definition of this
[53:48] word simple amen it means easily
[53:50] understood or done amen it is presenting
[53:52] no difficulty it is used to emphasize
[53:55] the fundamental
[53:57] and straightforward nature of something
[53:59] plain basic or uncomplicated in form
[54:02] amen nature or design it is without much
[54:04] decoration amen or ornamentation now can
[54:07] I just say this to you we're living in a
[54:09] world where everything is
[54:11] complicated I think we can all agree on
[54:14] that point amen everything from
[54:16] education to government to science Amen
[54:18] to political systems amen the economy is
[54:21] even compli am mean everything around us
[54:23] is complicated and let me just say this
[54:25] what's not already been complicated amen
[54:28] just give it a few days and it will be
[54:30] amen amen it used to be you just go open
[54:32] the refrigerator and get you out
[54:33] something cold to drink amen but now you
[54:35] got about have a college degree Amen to
[54:37] even get in the thing because there's so
[54:39] much science and so much education
[54:41] taking over these things amen now listen
[54:44] the devil don't stop out there but that
[54:46] devil moves right in the message of the
[54:47] hour churches and tries to start
[54:49] complicating things amen but let me say
[54:52] this we will not bow our knee and we
[54:54] will not follow a spirit of organized
[54:56] religion amen that raises its head
[54:58] around this message amen because
[55:00] organized religion is what took the word
[55:03] of God and made it complicated and made
[55:05] it difficult and made it confusing
[55:08] because the prophet of God said
[55:09] organized religion amen does not tend a
[55:12] simple word he said in the Dark Ages the
[55:14] word was almost entirely lost to the
[55:16] people but God sent Luther with the word
[55:19] and the Lutheran spoke for God at that
[55:21] time but they organized and again the
[55:23] pure word was lost amen for organization
[55:26] tends toward dogma and Creed amen and
[55:29] not simple word they could no longer
[55:31] speak for God so then God sent Wesley
[55:34] and he was a voice with a word in his
[55:35] day and the people who took his
[55:37] Revelation from God became the living
[55:39] Epistles read and known of all men for
[55:41] their generation when the Methodist
[55:43] failed God raised up others and so it
[55:45] has come on through the years until this
[55:47] last day amen there is again another
[55:50] people Amen in the land who under their
[55:53] Messenger will be the final voice Amen
[55:56] to the final age amen whenever organized
[55:59] religion moved in amen God raised a
[56:02] standard and he raised the people to
[56:04] follow that standard and the people
[56:06] become the combativeness amen to the
[56:08] spirit of organized religion well let me
[56:10] just say this to you we are not amen the
[56:12] denominational Brides but we are that

[59:34] he can do
[59:37] anything I said I believe he's here
[59:40] drawing out a simple people who loves
[59:43] him and believes he can do anything
[59:46] y'all remember in Matthew 16 the Bible
[59:49] said that the that the the disciples
[59:50] were come to the other side and they had
[59:52] forgotten to take some bread and Jesus
[59:54] said to them take he and beware the 11
[59:56] of the Pharisees and Sadducees 16:7 and
[59:59] they reason among themselves saying it's
[1:00:00] because we've taken no bread which when
[1:00:02] Jesus perceived that he said to them oh
[1:00:05] ye little faith while reason you among
[1:00:06] yourselves because you brought no bread
[1:00:09] do you not understand neither remember
[1:00:11] the Five Loaves of the 5,000 and how
[1:00:14] many baskets you took up neither the
[1:00:16] seven loaves of the 4,000 and how many
[1:00:18] baskets you took up how is it that you
[1:00:20] do not understand that I spake to you
[1:00:23] not concerning bread that you should be
[1:00:25] aware of the Le of the Pharisees and
[1:00:27] Sadducees then understood they how that
[1:00:29] he bath them out of Beware B them not
[1:00:32] Beware of the leaven of bread but of the
[1:00:34] doctrine of the Pharisees and of the
[1:00:36] Sadducees now here's what he's doing as
[1:00:38] he's saying amen the doctrine of the
[1:00:40] Pharisees and Sadducees amen is a
[1:00:43] Doctrine Amen to rob you of the power to
[1:00:45] believe that God can do anything any
[1:00:48] time any place anywhere under any
[1:00:51] condition brother must ask a question
[1:00:53] what did Jesus mean in St Matthew 169
[1:00:56] and 10 what do the 12 baskets and seven
[1:00:58] baskets represent he said in other words
[1:01:01] like this if you seen God provide and do
[1:01:04] a miracle then can he not do a miracle
[1:01:08] again if you seen him do it one time can
[1:01:11] he not do it again if you seen him save
[1:01:13] one time can he not save again if you
[1:01:16] seen him heal one time can he not heal
[1:01:18] again if you seen him resurrect one time
[1:01:21] can he not resurrect again I tell you
[1:01:23] what we ought to do tonight we ought to
[1:01:24] shake off ever sadducee and Pharisee
[1:01:27] doctrine that is creping around this
[1:01:29] message and say well it could only
[1:01:30] happen this time and could only happen
[1:01:32] that time and could only happen this
[1:01:34] time but I am a believer it can happen
[1:01:36] again and again and again and again and
[1:01:41] again I believe he can save again I
[1:01:44] believe he can refill again I believe he
[1:01:46] can revive again see in other words if
[1:01:49] he saves you from a life of sin can he
[1:01:51] not heal your body amen if he saves you
[1:01:53] from a life of sin can he not heal your
[1:01:56] body don't you remember when you was a
[1:01:58] sinner how he lifted your soul and Faith
[1:02:00] to believe can he not likewise do
[1:02:02] something great amen for you again can
[1:02:05] he do the miracle or anything else for
[1:02:07] you he said remember like when they
[1:02:09] crossed the Red Sea God opened the way
[1:02:11] like that and made the Red Sea open and
[1:02:13] walked through come right on the other
[1:02:15] side and as soon as they got without
[1:02:17] water they started murmuring as soon as
[1:02:19] they got without bread they started
[1:02:20] crying we don't have no bread see said
[1:02:23] didn't you consider the miracle back
[1:02:24] there with the Red Sea well they got in
[1:02:26] a spot by the Red Sea they said we ought
[1:02:28] have died here coming Egyptian right on
[1:02:30] this now here it is what are we going to
[1:02:32] do he said who smoke the Earth was
[1:02:34] plague still there who kept the sun
[1:02:36] shining and gohing see we must remember
[1:02:38] those things and remember that God is
[1:02:41] God hallelujah he said any of it he's
[1:02:44] still God he certainly can do
[1:02:47] anything now you know when you become
[1:02:50] you know when you become a complicated
[1:02:51] people is when something happens between
[1:02:54] one miracle and another and you think
[1:02:56] because of what happened something can't
[1:02:57] happen good again well we might as well
[1:03:00] preach we here amen because youve seen
[1:03:02] one Victory and then there was little
[1:03:04] space of trouble and the Devil comes in
[1:03:06] and says because of that trouble and
[1:03:08] that situation then that's going to
[1:03:10] hinder God Amen from working again but I
[1:03:12] come here not to say the devil is a liar
[1:03:14] amen and there is a people here tonight
[1:03:16] who says I don't matter what condition
[1:03:18] I'm in I don't care what way I'm in if
[1:03:20] God moved before he can move again come
[1:03:23] on evening lot y'all got a youth camp in
[1:03:24] a few days amen God has blessed that
[1:03:27] camp God has used that camp amen I stand
[1:03:29] here tonight as a testimony of the Youth
[1:03:32] Camp of Louisiana amen and I'll say this
[1:03:34] amen if God did it for me he can do it
[1:03:37] for anybody if God did it before he can
[1:03:39] do it again I think it's time to kick
[1:03:41] out the Pharisee and saddu doctrine that
[1:03:45] is so complicated the movement of the
[1:03:47] Holy Ghost and bring a liberty back in
[1:03:50] the church to believe for the impossible
[1:03:52] to believe for a miracle to believe for
[1:03:55] the come on didn't he open the Red Sea
[1:03:57] didn't he bring the walls of Jericho
[1:03:58] down didn't he raise the Widow of Nam
[1:04:00] son didn't he heal blind barus didn't he
[1:04:03] save the woman at the well didn't he
[1:04:05] give him the upper didn't he give him
[1:04:07] the holy ghost in the upper if he did it
[1:04:09] before he can do it
[1:04:12] again if he did it before he can do it
[1:04:15] again because he's still
[1:04:18] God can I say this brother lemel he
[1:04:20] simply still
[1:04:23] God I felt good he simply still God and
[1:04:27] brother William if he's simply still God
[1:04:30] then we're simply still
[1:04:32] Believers hello somebody if he's simply
[1:04:35] still God we're simply still Believers
[1:04:38] and if thou can't believe then some
[1:04:40] things are possible a few things are
[1:04:43] possible one Miracle here and there is
[1:04:45] possible one Revelation here and there
[1:04:47] is possible amen what Pharisee Bible are
[1:04:49] you reading out of Amen if fou can't
[1:04:52] believe amen all things are possible to
[1:04:56] them that believe Hallelujah Noah was a
[1:04:58] simple believer and he preached the
[1:05:00] gospel you know what it was it was out
[1:05:02] of the way it was out of line with the
[1:05:05] way of the believer now that's the
[1:05:07] problem amen is if somebody believes one
[1:05:09] way and God says something different you
[1:05:11] got to leave the way somebody's
[1:05:13] believing and go with God and stand with
[1:05:16] God in the face of criticism in the face
[1:05:19] of hery come on in the face of heresy
[1:05:21] whatever you got to do you got to stand
[1:05:23] with God and believe that God is still
[1:05:26] God and His word is still true his power
[1:05:29] is still here he said see this simple
[1:05:32] sheep herder believed if God said it
[1:05:34] would rain It Would Rain just compare
[1:05:35] that with today about somebody gets
[1:05:37] healed they say well it's only emotion
[1:05:39] or I can scientifically prove to you
[1:05:41] that the cancer or the substance or the
[1:05:43] thing is still there are you ready for
[1:05:45] this amen scientifically amen they can
[1:05:47] prove the substance they can prove the
[1:05:49] cancer is still there I love what a
[1:05:51] prophet said but Timmy said but to the
[1:05:53] believer it's gone
[1:05:56] come on to science it's still there but
[1:05:58] to the believer it's gone because he's
[1:06:01] not looking at the substance amen he's
[1:06:03] looking at the promise come on Church
[1:06:06] he's not looking at the substance he's
[1:06:08] not looking at the report he's not
[1:06:10] looking at the signs he's looking at the
[1:06:12] promise and the promise says it's gone
[1:06:15] amen I say tonight give us this s
[1:06:17] Phoenician woman's attitude she was a
[1:06:19] simple believer and the prodag God said
[1:06:21] I lay hands upon this sister may she
[1:06:23] have the attitude of the s bonan woman
[1:06:26] may she be healed in Jesus Christ's name
[1:06:28] are y'all ready for this he said let the
[1:06:31] heart be well in the name of Jesus
[1:06:33] Christ I speak these words it has to be
[1:06:36] well amen it can't be anything else I
[1:06:39] love that let the heart be well it has
[1:06:42] to be well it can't be anything else
[1:06:45] because Jesus said I can if you believe
[1:06:47] now if he can make a squirrel appear
[1:06:49] like that like he did a Ram one time he
[1:06:52] can make that heart appear normal and
[1:06:54] well
[1:06:56] has to be in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:06:59] let the heart be well now isn't that
[1:07:02] simple it is simple but God is so simple
[1:07:05] are you ready for this now you just be
[1:07:08] simple enough not to even think about it
[1:07:13] anymore God was simple enough to heal
[1:07:15] you of it he was simple enough Amen to
[1:07:18] send a man in the pullit and say the
[1:07:20] Cancer's gone the sickness is defeated
[1:07:23] Christ is the Healer amen God was simple
[1:07:26] enough Amen to send a simple word to
[1:07:28] send a simple healing into your body
[1:07:31] let's just be simple enough to believe
[1:07:33] it amen if God said I'm Healed I'm going
[1:07:35] to believe I'm Healed if God said I'm
[1:07:37] delivered I'm going to believe I are
[1:07:38] y'all hearing me the message of the Hour
[1:07:40] come Amen to break the confusion and
[1:07:43] bring a simple people back who could
[1:07:45] just simply take God and his word and
[1:07:48] walk on rejoicing and praising God I
[1:07:51] love how brother talks about the Indian
[1:07:53] man brought his father to the meeting
[1:07:55] one time he said now brother BR I packed
[1:07:56] him across the river on a stretcher I
[1:07:58] said sir aren't you afraid amen that
[1:08:00] you'll take pneumonia he said no Jesus
[1:08:03] Christ is take care of me I bring my
[1:08:05] father I said you believe he said yes
[1:08:07] that's why I brought him he said I said
[1:08:09] pass him on by and as he went by I laid
[1:08:12] my hands over on the old man and I said
[1:08:14] dear God an old ancient father here
[1:08:16] laying here old and crippled up and
[1:08:18] shaken with py like F I said have mercy
[1:08:20] on him God and heal him I pray in Jesus
[1:08:23] name I said now take him on as you
[1:08:27] believe so will it be I brought another
[1:08:29] one the next one coming just a tired I
[1:08:31] could hardly stand there but then all of
[1:08:33] a sudden I heard somebody amen screaming
[1:08:36] and going on it looked and the old man
[1:08:38] had the board on his own shoulders and
[1:08:40] he was going along W when everybody like
[1:08:42] that amen just walk along amen just that
[1:08:45] simple but you try to figure it all out
[1:08:47] how it happens and that's the reason you
[1:08:50] miss it amen but they just simply
[1:08:52] believe let me say this friends quit
[1:08:54] trying to figure it out and believe the
[1:08:56] word that's being spoken over your life
[1:08:59] and let that word whip that devil and
[1:09:01] bring a healing into your body well I
[1:09:03] don't know how this can happen I don't
[1:09:05] know how the change I don't know how the
[1:09:07] situations can happen I know how it can
[1:09:09] happen if somebody step out and take God
[1:09:12] at his word and believe that if he did
[1:09:15] it before he can do it
[1:09:17] again are y'all hearing me I think it's
[1:09:20] time to take the restrictions and the
[1:09:22] limitations off of our faith and start
[1:09:24] saying God your God in the face of every
[1:09:27] difficulty in the face of every bad day
[1:09:29] in the face of every trial my God
[1:09:32] remains on the throne as
[1:09:34] God come on we might as well preach or
[1:09:36] here amen I believe it's the season for
[1:09:39] miracles I believe it's the season for
[1:09:41] victories I believe it's the season for
[1:09:43] the supernatural you know what I believe
[1:09:45] is out of season bu your cold formal
[1:09:47] ritualistic ideas around this message is
[1:09:50] out of season amen but the power of the
[1:09:53] Revelation that's been seasoned with the
[1:09:55] anointing of God is in season for every
[1:09:58] believer who can sit at the table and
[1:10:00] can feed upon the promises of God listen
[1:10:03] I believe we're living in a special time
[1:10:05] I believe it's a time where things are
[1:10:06] happening amen and we can't figure out
[1:10:08] how they're happening we can't figure
[1:10:10] out why they're happening but we know
[1:10:12] one thing they're
[1:10:13] happening come on we might as well
[1:10:15] preach we're here amen y'all realize
[1:10:17] you're living in a SE I've been I've
[1:10:18] been using your church for a few days
[1:10:20] amen we're living in a season amen where
[1:10:22] we're not turning prayer request in on
[1:10:24] Wednesday and 3 months later still
[1:10:26] praying about it but we're living in a
[1:10:28] season amen where a prayer request can
[1:10:30] be turned in and can be healed in the
[1:10:32] same
[1:10:34] service are you hearing me it's a season
[1:10:37] to believe these things I was preaching
[1:10:39] out in Georgia a few years ago there was
[1:10:41] a paricus come in right before I got up
[1:10:42] to preach there was a lady in the
[1:10:44] hospital during Co there was a lady in
[1:10:46] the hospital she had a high fever in a
[1:10:48] terrible condition Amen brother Tim we
[1:10:50] just stood there and prayed and
[1:10:52] pronounced the word of God over her and
[1:10:54] about halfway through the sermon they
[1:10:55] brought a prayer request up and laid it
[1:10:57] down and I turned it over and I begin to
[1:10:59] read it and this is what it said as the
[1:11:01] Saints begin to pray the fever broke
[1:11:04] she's doing better getting ready to go
[1:11:06] home well when I said that it literally
[1:11:08] like somebody opened the floodgates of
[1:11:10] heaven and an anointing dropped in that
[1:11:12] building you know what's happening
[1:11:14] friends the Supernatural is happening
[1:11:16] Miracles are taking place but we got to
[1:11:18] kick that old formal devil out that says
[1:11:21] the message can't do it and preaching
[1:11:22] the word can't do it I believe they're
[1:11:24] still power in the preaching of the
[1:11:27] Simplicity of the revelation of Jesus
[1:11:30] Christ in the age we're living in y'all
[1:11:32] know y'all remember a few years ago amen
[1:11:34] our sister come up for prayer for her
[1:11:36] brother who was out of church amen I
[1:11:38] want to sing back in church brother
[1:11:39] justware probably you're not amen he's
[1:11:41] here amen I want to see him back in the
[1:11:43] house of God right amen do you realize
[1:11:45] it wasn't four Services later he showed
[1:11:47] up it wasn't six months later amen but
[1:11:49] within a matter of minutes amen her
[1:11:51] prayer request turned into a testimony
[1:11:54] and that testimony has gone around the
[1:11:57] world whipping devils and encouraging
[1:11:59] faith for mamas and families to believe
[1:12:02] if God Did It for Justin he can do it
[1:12:04] for their family I'm talking about a God
[1:12:07] who it's time to take the limits off of
[1:12:09] him and believe simply
[1:12:12] believe Hallelujah simply believe if God
[1:12:16] did it before he can do it
[1:12:18] again hallelujah amen simply believe let
[1:12:21] me say this with a simple faith will
[1:12:24] come a simple confession
[1:12:26] and I love what the prodag God says he
[1:12:28] says that's what people who get he said
[1:12:30] that's what people get who try to figure
[1:12:32] it out they miss it but you just believe
[1:12:34] it and when God says it just say that's
[1:12:36] right
[1:12:38] God that's right God see that can change
[1:12:42] the atmosphere in a service when the
[1:12:45] word Goes Forth and you say that's right
[1:12:49] God glory when the anointing is moving
[1:12:52] and you say that's right God when
[1:12:55] brother Joe's up here preaching and says
[1:12:57] the healings here the miracle here when
[1:12:59] brother Tim's laboring or the anointing
[1:13:01] amen something moving you and say that's
[1:13:03] right God see what that is that's not
[1:13:05] emotion that's not sensation that's not
[1:13:08] a preacher trying to get an amen for his
[1:13:10] ego amen that's the anointing moving a
[1:13:13] simple believer to a simple confession I
[1:13:16] love this brother said Jesus talked with
[1:13:18] such a simple language with the simple
[1:13:20] people see he wasn't out there great big
[1:13:22] swelling outstanding hold on for dear
[1:13:23] life as I call it words and miss it he
[1:13:26] said now watch the more simpler you can
[1:13:28] get amen the higher God will raise
[1:13:32] you the more simpler you get the higher
[1:13:36] God will raise you now you say brother
[1:13:37] anderw what is a simple person a simple
[1:13:40] person never questions the word of God I
[1:13:42] love Proverbs 14:15 the simple believeth
[1:13:45] every word amen but The Prudent man
[1:13:47] lookth well to his going remember said
[1:13:49] but those simple people they never
[1:13:51] question they don't question they see
[1:13:54] something done that settles them every
[1:13:56] one of them he said you should never
[1:13:58] question the word of God that's what got
[1:14:00] the whole human race in trouble when Eve
[1:14:02] question whether God would keep all this
[1:14:03] word or not I say tonight Brethren are
[1:14:06] you ready for this I say tonight
[1:14:08] Brethren it's come time that we must
[1:14:11] believe every word that God wrote every
[1:14:13] bit of it to be the truth now in order
[1:14:15] to believe sometimes you got to lay some
[1:14:18] things aside the protag God said go back
[1:14:21] to the beginning therefore if we're
[1:14:22] going to talk on the church age we got
[1:14:24] to go back to the beginning we got to
[1:14:25] lay aside every statement that has been
[1:14:28] made down through the age if we're going
[1:14:30] to believe the Revelation that is coming
[1:14:33] to us we've got to lay aside everything
[1:14:36] that's contrary to the word of God Amen
[1:14:38] I love how the prophet of God gives us
[1:14:40] three identifications of simple
[1:14:42] Believers he said now watch follow the
[1:14:44] generation of Seth they were humble they
[1:14:46] were peasants they were farmers on down
[1:14:48] to the destruction but kan's children
[1:14:50] was smart intellectual group they could
[1:14:52] temper copper make Metals Builders they
[1:14:54] were smart men when these other men amen
[1:14:56] just dwelt in tents and heard their
[1:14:58] sheep here it is and rested upon the
[1:15:01] promises of God see just follow the
[1:15:04] genealogy that's how Noah was chose from
[1:15:06] that kind of people that's how Paul was
[1:15:08] taken from that flock see that's how
[1:15:10] John Wesley Martin Luther what more
[1:15:12] that's how you come to be what you are
[1:15:14] today the same thing amen humbled to
[1:15:17] believe the promises of
[1:15:19] God so the message of the hour is coming
[1:15:22] to the church amen to Humble them to
[1:15:25] Simply believe the promises of God I
[1:15:27] love how the Bible tells us in Genesis
[1:15:29] 18:17 that the Lord said shall I hide
[1:15:31] from Abraham that thing which I do
[1:15:34] seeing that Abraham shall surely amen
[1:15:36] become a great and mighty nation and all
[1:15:38] the nations of the earth amen shall be
[1:15:41] blessed in him in Matthew 5:5 Jesus says
[1:15:44] blessed are the meek amen for they shall
[1:15:46] inherit the promises now in other words
[1:15:49] the humbled ones amen are the ones who
[1:15:51] will inherit the promises of God in the
[1:15:53] breach B said Jesus blessed are the meek
[1:15:56] the simple ones they don't try to be
[1:15:58] something great big they shall inherit
[1:16:00] the earth and Jesus said so now they
[1:16:02] polluted it and God will destroy them
[1:16:05] but the meek shall inherit the earth
[1:16:07] amen after it's been purified can I say
[1:16:10] this to you amen God will hide his
[1:16:12] Secrets amen from the wise and prudent
[1:16:15] but he will reveal
[1:16:17] them to the bride which will become
[1:16:20] babes which will which will learn of him
[1:16:22] he said all this Myster is revealed only
[1:16:24] is he Pro promis to his bride and hell
[1:16:26] is against this truth of the revelation
[1:16:28] of this mystery amen now watch this
[1:16:30] church that's why the prophet had to
[1:16:32] come and release this mystery because
[1:16:35] hell is against this bride he says but
[1:16:37] the bride is standing on it see that's
[1:16:40] her stand he said that's her stand
[1:16:42] where's her stand on the revelation of
[1:16:45] Jesus Christ listen that's where we
[1:16:47] stand on our good days is on the
[1:16:49] Revelation that's SAR we stand on our
[1:16:50] bad days is on the Revelation when we're
[1:16:53] on the mountain we stand on the
[1:16:55] Revelation when we're in the valley we
[1:16:57] stand on the Revelation listen the
[1:16:59] message of the hour has come to give the
[1:17:01] church a place to
[1:17:04] stand now I'm going to say this that
[1:17:06] little girl that little faith woman
[1:17:08] brother Tim preached a beautiful message
[1:17:09] on it there in Arkansas amen that little
[1:17:11] faith woman amen she's not living by
[1:17:13] what she can see she's not living by
[1:17:15] what she can feel amen she's living by
[1:17:18] faith amen and that is the faith of
[1:17:20] Jesus Christ and brother tells us a
[1:17:22] beautiful story of a little girl who was
[1:17:24] chosen
[1:17:25] amen by the armor son to be his bride
[1:17:27] you know what brother BR called her he
[1:17:29] said that girl was
[1:17:31] simple-minded that little girl that was
[1:17:33] chosen to be the wife of the armor son
[1:17:36] he said she was simple-minded Revelation
[1:17:38] 19:7 said let us be glad and rejoice and
[1:17:41] give honor to him for the marriage of
[1:17:43] the Lamb is come amen and his wife hath
[1:17:46] made herself ready remember said there
[1:17:48] she was she got herself already ready
[1:17:51] all cleaned up all washed and the
[1:17:53] wedding garment on now want I want you
[1:17:55] to catch something here and you know
[1:17:56] what as it got closer the more critical
[1:17:59] got her little cousins let me ask you
[1:18:01] this when did they get critical they
[1:18:03] didn't get critical when she said he's
[1:18:04] coming back for me they didn't get
[1:18:06] critical amen when she went and got
[1:18:08] washed up they didn't get critical when
[1:18:10] she got cleaned up but when she put the
[1:18:12] wedding garments
[1:18:14] on when she put the wedding garments on
[1:18:17] is when they begin to get critical of
[1:18:19] her amen because now she's changing
[1:18:22] positions amen from just a girl amen
[1:18:25] from a girlfriend from just a fiance but
[1:18:27] she has now put on the wedding garments
[1:18:31] and the protagon said they say you poor
[1:18:32] little simpleminded thing do you mean to
[1:18:34] tell me if the armor son would marry
[1:18:36] somebody he would marry somebody like us
[1:18:38] somebody who had some fit and Society
[1:18:40] had some education had some glamour
[1:18:41] about them he said see that's the way
[1:18:43] the church thinks today but how far off
[1:18:46] they are they're way off amen listen
[1:18:49] friends that's why we got Liberty to
[1:18:50] shout that's why we got Liberty to
[1:18:52] Rejoice that's why we got Liberty to
[1:18:55] enjoy the blessings of the message amen
[1:18:57] it's because we're not a girlfriend
[1:18:59] we're not flirting with the message but
[1:19:01] the prophet of God said if I can get her
[1:19:03] to stand still long enough amen I will
[1:19:05] dress her in the garments of the word
[1:19:08] and there is a bride on the Earth today
[1:19:10] lay out a sea as naked amen but there's
[1:19:12] a bride who is dressed with the wedding
[1:19:15] garments on there's no spots on them
[1:19:17] there's no wrinkles on them and you know
[1:19:19] what's happening they're getting more
[1:19:20] critical they're getting more critical
[1:19:22] of our worship they're getting more
[1:19:23] critical of our preaching or get more
[1:19:25] critical of our singing or get more
[1:19:27] critical of the anointing amen but you
[1:19:29] know what I say criticize all you want
[1:19:31] to amen because one of these mornings
[1:19:33] between 6:00 and 9 that horse is going
[1:19:36] to come down the road and the butt
[1:19:38] board's going to open and I'm going to
[1:19:39] step in and I'm going to leave here in
[1:19:42] the moment in the twinkl of an ey call
[1:19:44] me simple-minded if you want
[1:19:47] to criticize me if you want to but I'm
[1:19:50] just simple enough to believe if he said
[1:19:53] he was going to come get me he's going
[1:19:55] to come get me I'm just simple enough to
[1:19:57] believe if he said I was going to be his
[1:19:59] bride he ain't going to save me or lose
[1:20:01] me he ain't going to teach me to swim
[1:20:03] and Let Me Drown he ain't going to build
[1:20:05] his home in me to move
[1:20:07] away I'm talking about somebody who's
[1:20:10] not just standing around looking at the
[1:20:11] wedding garments but they have put the
[1:20:14] wedding garments
[1:20:16] on
[1:20:17] Hallelujah well go ahead and walk around
[1:20:20] in them for a minute go ahead and enjoy
[1:20:22] the blessings of being the Bride of
[1:20:24] Jesus Christ come on y'all know I'm
[1:20:26] preaching the truth tonight amen they
[1:20:27] can laugh they can criticize they can
[1:20:29] call us holy rollers they can call us
[1:20:31] emotionalist they can call us message
[1:20:33] Fanatics they can call us what they want
[1:20:35] to but some morning between 6:00 and 9
[1:20:39] they're going to have to change what
[1:20:40] they call us they're going to have to
[1:20:41] call us gone because we're not going to
[1:20:44] be here because the message of the hour
[1:20:47] has brought a change upon the church
[1:20:50] hallelujah amen there's a change on the
[1:20:53] church now I'll said to you like this I
[1:20:55] don't believe the message come to give
[1:20:56] us a puffed up
[1:20:57] mind as a matter of fact I believe it
[1:21:00] came to Humble us brother BR preaches a
[1:21:04] message called humble thyself he said I
[1:21:06] was thinking on a little illustration
[1:21:07] amen can I read this to you he said to
[1:21:09] back up what he said now look at this
[1:21:11] watch to find out what time it is unless
[1:21:13] every instrument in that watch is
[1:21:15] coordinating on with the other will
[1:21:17] never know the correct time said and
[1:21:19] that LS all of us all
[1:21:22] together if we want to see the Third
[1:21:25] P really do something for God it's
[1:21:29] coordination with every one of us
[1:21:31] together to Humble ourselves before God
[1:21:34] and confess our wrong and pray and
[1:21:38] believe God for those
[1:21:40] things how many believes we're in the
[1:21:42] third
[1:21:43] pole now the problem of God said God can
[1:21:45] only operate as we let him operate he
[1:21:48] said you know people want power and
[1:21:50] really they don't know what power is now
[1:21:52] now now put your seat but I'm going to
[1:21:53] preach for a minute if that's okay
[1:21:54] brother Tim amen they don't know what
[1:21:56] power is they don't really know what
[1:21:58] goes up they don't know what goes with
[1:21:59] it the Way Up Is Down always if you want
[1:22:02] Power amen see how humble you can
[1:22:05] get now you know what amazes me is the
[1:22:08] people that fight about the power in the
[1:22:10] message are the most arrogant people I
[1:22:12] think I've ever
[1:22:15] met now come on church but watch a
[1:22:18] prophet just get away from all your
[1:22:20] worldly thinking and humble yourself
[1:22:23] before God and then you've got more
[1:22:25] power amen than the man that runs all
[1:22:27] over the building and makes a big lot of
[1:22:28] noise see because you've been able to
[1:22:31] conquer yourself and commit yourself to
[1:22:33] Christ you see to humble yourself before
[1:22:36] him amen that's really power so here a
[1:22:39] prophet is connecting power with the
[1:22:41] ability to humble yourself the prophet
[1:22:43] is connect oh God have mercy the prophet
[1:22:47] is connecting power with the ability to
[1:22:49] lay aside what we want and to accept
[1:22:52] what God wants now you all know if
[1:22:54] you're going to a church amen and got
[1:22:55] got a good siiz crowd of people here
[1:22:58] amen listen there's always going to be
[1:23:00] somebody who thinks it ought to be done
[1:23:01] a little bit different than the way it's
[1:23:03] being
[1:23:05] done well if we could change this then
[1:23:08] that would fix that and if we could
[1:23:09] change that that would fix this and if
[1:23:11] brother Tim would change this and
[1:23:13] brother Aaron would change that amen but
[1:23:14] let me just say this if you would change
[1:23:16] it might fix a lot of
[1:23:19] things come on now amen always trying to
[1:23:22] fix everything and change everybody amen
[1:23:24] but sometimes we need to look in the
[1:23:26] mirror and realize the problem ain't the
[1:23:28] song leader the problem ain't the
[1:23:30] musicians the problem ain't the new
[1:23:32] people that moved in the church the
[1:23:34] problem ain't all these other things the
[1:23:36] problem is standing in the mirror
[1:23:37] looking at oursel when we get ready and
[1:23:39] the problem is we're too arrogant to say
[1:23:42] somebody else is right and that might be
[1:23:44] a better way to do it oh glory to God we
[1:23:48] might as well preacher here a well I
[1:23:50] don't like when they sing that song that
[1:23:51] song's too new you know I don't like
[1:23:53] that song amen now come on Amen so then
[1:23:55] you got that whole bunch of well we
[1:23:57] ought to just sing old songs you know
[1:23:59] amen let's just sing them old Lutheran
[1:24:00] songs and brother Tim I've sat in
[1:24:02] services and we sang songs that Luther
[1:24:04] didn't even know and it didn't change
[1:24:06] the anointing a bit more than if we have
[1:24:07] sung our God is
[1:24:09] Awesome come on church amen well I think
[1:24:12] we ought to change this amen but why
[1:24:13] don't we change
[1:24:15] us come on why don't we humble our ideas
[1:24:19] come on Church y'all know what I'm
[1:24:20] talking about amen let them sing a song
[1:24:22] you don't like amen listen we all know

[1:24:27] at the musicians or you look glory to
[1:24:31] God somebody preach are you with me now
[1:24:33] amen but sometime or another you got to
[1:24:35] humble yourself and say God it's not
[1:24:38] about me and it's not about you it's
[1:24:40] about him it's about you Lord coming in
[1:24:43] the building and blessing somebody it's
[1:24:46] about you Lord coming in the sanctuary
[1:24:49] and deliver in somebody's heart it's
[1:24:51] about you Lord it ain't about the way I
[1:24:53] think it ain't about what I want it's
[1:24:55] about
[1:24:58] him can I let y'all in a little secret
[1:25:01] down here you on a little secret there's
[1:25:03] songs I don't
[1:25:06] like say that
[1:25:09] again and you know how you knew that
[1:25:13] because I told
[1:25:15] you you didn't know that because the way
[1:25:18] I act when they sing
[1:25:19] them well come on Church you didn't know
[1:25:23] that cuz I put a post on Facebook about
[1:25:25] the songs and everything you didn't know
[1:25:27] that you know how you knew that cuz I
[1:25:29] told you now you know why I told you
[1:25:31] it's because I'm not a
[1:25:34] baby I was with some brothers the other
[1:25:36] day and they got talking about some
[1:25:37] songs and they said well we're going to
[1:25:38] sing this one I said you know I I really
[1:25:40] never have cared for that song but what'
[1:25:42] you say that's what they said how we
[1:25:45] didn't know that I said no you didn't
[1:25:47] you know why cuz I'm not a baby I'm a
[1:25:49] mature adopted son of God and I've Been
[1:25:51] Around Church long enough to know if
[1:25:53] they sing a song I Don't Like give it
[1:25:55] five minutes and they're going to sing
[1:25:57] another song now let me say this if he
[1:25:59] comes on how great thou art or I would
[1:26:02] not be denied or there power in the
[1:26:04] blood or Pass Me Nots or we will see
[1:26:06] Miracles or our god is awesome what
[1:26:09] difference does it make as long as he
[1:26:11] comes into the sanctuary and begins to
[1:26:14] bless his church and begins to heal the
[1:26:16] sick as long as he comes we ought to
[1:26:19] take the shackles h of the atmosphere
[1:26:22] release the atmosphere and let the Holy
[1:26:24] Ghost find a simple people who believes
[1:26:27] God is still God and His word is still
[1:26:30] true and his power is still here and his
[1:26:33] anointing can still destroy the Yoke of
[1:26:35] the enemy anywhere anytime any place
[1:26:39] under any
[1:26:41] conditions we want to see God take the
[1:26:43] brakes off the
[1:26:45] [Applause]
[1:26:47] atmosphere now the prodag God said
[1:26:49] conquer yourself commit yourself to
[1:26:51] Christ humble yourself before him that's
[1:26:54] really power you show me a church that's
[1:26:57] humble real
[1:26:59] humble not an arrogancy a church a sweet
[1:27:03] Humble Church I'll show you a church
[1:27:06] that has the favor and power of God in
[1:27:09] it that's right that's the thing it
[1:27:13] takes humility humbling ourselves before
[1:27:18] God put your seat belts on letting God
[1:27:21] work through us don't have to make a L
[1:27:24] of
[1:27:26] noise now there's all them noise people
[1:27:28] right there
[1:27:30] amen will you amen too quick because
[1:27:34] there's a difference in noise and
[1:27:37] sound hello somebody there's a
[1:27:40] difference in noise and sound most
[1:27:42] people generally think of sound and
[1:27:44] noise as being the same thing however
[1:27:47] there is actually a difference between
[1:27:49] noise versus sound sound is a type of
[1:27:53] energy that travels through the air or
[1:27:55] any other medium and is then heard when
[1:27:58] it reaches a person's
[1:28:01] ear so while the word is being preached
[1:28:04] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[1:28:07] the spirit is saying and the prophet of
[1:28:09] God said the Holy Ghost is the energy oh
[1:28:12] God the Holy Ghost is the energy of the
[1:28:15] church so when the word is being
[1:28:17] preached the energy of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:20] picks that word up and carries it to
[1:28:22] your ear and puts it in in your heart
[1:28:25] and you say Amen now a lot of people say
[1:28:27] that's a bunch of noise that's not noise
[1:28:30] that's sound because noise can be
[1:28:32] described as unwanted sound can I ask
[1:28:35] you this I know there's some places that
[1:28:38] amens are unwanted sound but wherever
[1:28:40] Jesus
[1:28:42] is wherever Jesus is amens are not nois
[1:28:46] now people say well wherever Jesus says
[1:28:48] there's a whole lot of noise and brother
[1:28:50] Andrew you just said amen that there was
[1:28:52] a difference in sound and noise there is
[1:28:54] is a difference in sound and noise and
[1:28:55] when Jesus passed by barus you know what
[1:28:58] the prophet God said he said there was a
[1:29:00] lot of noise but you know where that
[1:29:02] noise was coming from it was coming from
[1:29:04] those who did not want him passing by
[1:29:06] where he was so the prophet of God said
[1:29:08] what they done was they formed a
[1:29:10] committee and they said well squash all
[1:29:12] this nonsense amen but there was a
[1:29:14] difference in barus barus had a
[1:29:17] revelation barus was in a terrible
[1:29:19] condition but when he heard oh God when
[1:29:23] the word got car to his ear that is
[1:29:25] Jesus of Nazareth passing by listen
[1:29:28] barnes's cry wasn't a why barnes's cry
[1:29:31] wasn't a w w w why his cry was a
[1:29:34] confession and as he begin to cry he was
[1:29:37] crying from a revelation that Jehovah of
[1:29:40] the old was the same God that got in
[1:29:42] Jesus and barus begin to say he's
[1:29:45] passing by Jesus thy son of David have
[1:29:48] mercy on me and you know what they said
[1:29:51] they said sh sh sh but you know what he
[1:29:54] did he cried the more a great deal you
[1:29:57] know why because he was in the position
[1:30:00] to receive his healing he was in the
[1:30:02] position listen in other words barus
[1:30:04] could look around and say I know you
[1:30:06] bunch of backslid and Pharisees and
[1:30:07] Sadducees really don't need nothing from
[1:30:09] God but I need something from
[1:30:12] God I need oh God I need something from
[1:30:16] God so you know what barame done he
[1:30:18] begin to cry out you know what he begin
[1:30:20] to say he begin to say Jesus have mercy
[1:30:23] upon me and the pr of God said Jesus
[1:30:25] didn't hear his voice but he failed his
[1:30:29] faith out of all that confusion brother
[1:30:32] Joe amen God had a simple man with a
[1:30:35] simple faith that believe God could
[1:30:37] still open blinded eyes and he began to
[1:30:39] say you can make fun of me if you want
[1:30:41] to you can laugh at me if you want to
[1:30:43] but I need a miracle well glory to God I
[1:30:46] think it's time Church to get back to
[1:30:48] crying out for God I think it's time to
[1:30:50] Humble ourselves well come on church
[1:30:53] amen humble ourselves
[1:30:54] and follow the leadership of the Holy
[1:30:55] Ghost if you got to cry for it cry for
[1:30:58] it if you got to holler for it holler
[1:31:00] for it but let me say this don't you
[1:31:02] don't you confuse noise and
[1:31:06] sound well brother Andrew all them young
[1:31:09] people shouting around that's a bunch of
[1:31:10] noise well if you'd been as bound as we

[1:31:28] I was lost if you was ever bound as
[1:31:30] Andrew Glover was bound if you was ever

[1:32:57] got so so high and mighty we can't
[1:32:58] welcome
[1:33:00] God now you saider what are you getting
[1:33:03] at well the Bible says we're living in
[1:33:05] the hour where there would be an
[1:33:06] unfolding or the revealing of the word
[1:33:10] of God now I love the book of Psalms can
[1:33:12] I share a few more things with you 119
[1:33:15] 130 the entrance of thy words giveth
[1:33:18] light are you ready for this it giveth
[1:33:22] understanding unto the simple
[1:33:25] now that word entrance is an open
[1:33:27] opening unfolding it's an entrance it's
[1:33:31] a
[1:33:32] doorway so in other words God enters the
[1:33:36] church through
[1:33:38] Simplicity now God unfolds
[1:33:43] himself in Simplicity in second Peter
[1:33:46] 11:11 for so an entrance shall be
[1:33:48] ministered unto you abundantly into the
[1:33:50] Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and
[1:33:52] Savior Jesus Christ said God's great
[1:33:54] mystery now being unfolded that's been
[1:33:56] hid since the foundation of the world
[1:33:59] but prefigured it all the way down
[1:34:00] through now watch he said down to the
[1:34:02] ages he has been slowly unfolding this
[1:34:05] mystery can you see now another place
[1:34:08] down to the ages he has been gradually
[1:34:10] letting it out slowly unfolding the
[1:34:12] mystery through the prophets and through
[1:34:14] the types now watch this in Christ the
[1:34:16] mystery paragraph 301 he said blind
[1:34:18] leaders to Blind notice god holds the
[1:34:20] key alone no Theologian can tell you if
[1:34:23] it's not known it's hid from them they
[1:34:25] know nothing about it so the schools
[1:34:27] when you say I got a pH or lldd to me
[1:34:30] and I believe in God now watch this he
[1:34:32] said now you say I got a pH or an lld to
[1:34:35] me and I believe into God and to any
[1:34:38] real True Believer that means you're
[1:34:40] just that much farther away you just
[1:34:42] backed off God is not known by education
[1:34:46] he's not known by how to explain it but
[1:34:48] God is known by the Simplicity and the
[1:34:51] revelation of Jesus Christ ready for
[1:34:53] this to the most illiterate person see
[1:34:56] now not your theology it's a revelation
[1:34:58] Upon This Rock I build my church no
[1:35:00] other rocks are
[1:35:02] accepted no other things accepted no
[1:35:05] other Roman Rock no other Protestant
[1:35:07] Rock no other school no other nothing
[1:35:10] but on exactly the revelation of Jesus
[1:35:13] Christ through the new birth he borns in
[1:35:16] there and he injects his own life and
[1:35:18] your life is gone and the life of Christ
[1:35:21] is projecting itself through you with
[1:35:23] the preeminence to the people that they
[1:35:25] see the very life and works and signs
[1:35:28] and wonders that he did is doing the
[1:35:30] same thing through you outside of that
[1:35:33] the rest of it's not even called to at
[1:35:35] all Watch God's Great Revelation
[1:35:38] unfolding now the promise of the hour is
[1:35:40] in the age of confusion there will come
[1:35:43] an understanding in Psalms 119:130 he
[1:35:46] says the entrance of thy words giveth
[1:35:49] light it giveth understanding amen unto
[1:35:52] the simple that word understanding means
[1:35:54] to have insight and the pro God says
[1:35:56] paragraph 127 God hid himself not today
[1:35:59] he said now today we preach philosophy
[1:36:01] we preach Creed denominationalism and so
[1:36:03] many things leaving off the word because
[1:36:06] they say it cannot be understood it can
[1:36:09] be understood it has to be he promised
[1:36:12] to do it now listen friends in the last
[1:36:15] days they're going to say we've gone as
[1:36:17] far as we can go because the things in
[1:36:20] the message are too hard to understand
[1:36:22] like we can't move in that third pool we
[1:36:25] can't move in that seventh seal we can't
[1:36:27] move into the theophanies we can't move
[1:36:29] into the promises of God we cannot move
[1:36:31] into future home we cannot move into
[1:36:33] Daniel 7 we cannot move into the
[1:36:35] adoption we cannot move in these things
[1:36:36] because they're too hard to understand
[1:36:39] but I love what Psalms 106 ver6 says it
[1:36:42] says we have sinned with our fathers we
[1:36:44] have committed iniquity we have done
[1:36:45] wickedly and our fathers understood not
[1:36:48] thy wonders in Egypt they remembered not
[1:36:50] the multitude of thy mercies but
[1:36:52] provoked him at the sea even at the Red
[1:36:54] Sea nevertheless he saved them amen for
[1:36:57] his name's sake that he might make his
[1:37:00] power to be known in other words amen
[1:37:03] God saved them so the Next Generation
[1:37:06] could testify amen of what God done amen
[1:37:09] for them at the Red Sea let me say this
[1:37:11] young people amen this message has not
[1:37:14] come to this generation to just be put
[1:37:16] back on a former generation or well I
[1:37:19] remember when I remember when but these
[1:37:21] men of God like brother Tim amen our
[1:37:23] brother bisc amen these Elders that had
[1:37:26] blazed the trail you know what they've
[1:37:27] done they brought us to the border and
[1:37:29] they haven't said now stay out of that
[1:37:31] message they said go into that message
[1:37:34] amen because there is where the mercies
[1:37:36] of God is there is where the grace of
[1:37:38] God is and you know what I say I say
[1:37:40] it's time to take our foot and kick that
[1:37:42] door down it says we cannot move into
[1:37:45] the revelation of what a prophet is
[1:37:47] taught in the age we're living in
[1:37:49] brother I believe it's moving time I
[1:37:51] believe it's time to move out of shallow
[1:37:53] Waters I believe it's time to move out
[1:37:55] of ankle deep water I believe it's time
[1:37:57] to move into some swimming Waters you
[1:38:00] are the generation that is set
[1:38:02] underneath the voice of the word and an
[1:38:04] entrance are you hearing me an entrance
[1:38:08] has been ministered unto you oh mercy
[1:38:12] now watch this God is so easy to be
[1:38:13] misunderstood by unbelievers by those
[1:38:15] who don't want to
[1:38:17] understand now we just now we just
[1:38:19] figured out brother Jimbo they don't
[1:38:21] want to understand so the reason they
[1:38:23] don't want to understand is the reason
[1:38:25] they don't want you to understand many
[1:38:27] people try to understand but they don't
[1:38:29] want to understand they just shut up
[1:38:31] themselves and say there's no such a
[1:38:33] thing I don't believe in such see then
[1:38:35] they can never understand but a man
[1:38:37] that's willing to
[1:38:40] understand that's willing to sit down
[1:38:43] come let us reason together say the Lord
[1:38:45] now that man is on the line of learning
[1:38:48] something from the
[1:38:50] Lord what are you saying I'm saying you
[1:38:53] got to kick the unbelief out you got to
[1:38:55] move out of the depths of Satan now come
[1:38:57] on Church the world is drowning in the
[1:39:00] depths of Satan by accepting substitutes
[1:39:03] for the reality but there is an open
[1:39:06] book there's an open door I'm going I'm
[1:39:09] going somewhere listen to me Church you
[1:39:11] don't have to stay where you're at are
[1:39:13] you hearing me you don't have to stay
[1:39:15] where you're at there's a door that's
[1:39:17] been Minister unto you and watch what
[1:39:18] the prop of God says the law of the Lord
[1:39:20] is perfect converting the soul the
[1:39:22] testim of the Lord making wise the
[1:39:24] simple so if you're going to go through
[1:39:26] this door you've got to move into the
[1:39:29] Simplicity of the way God does things
[1:39:32] listen the pr of God said very beautiful
[1:39:34] he said those little handkerchiefs God
[1:39:36] always hon that such a simple thing as
[1:39:38] print over a handkerchief now can I say
[1:39:39] this to
[1:39:42] you who would have thought that a shout
[1:39:45] would bring a wall
[1:39:48] down but it
[1:39:50] did who would have fought a wall that
[1:39:53] you could run chariot races on top of
[1:39:56] would have brought would oh God would
[1:39:58] have brought a wall down but when they
[1:40:00] begin to shout the Bible the prag God
[1:40:03] said watch when they begin to shout he
[1:40:05] said see it's so simple but that's what
[1:40:07] makes it God to me he said when they
[1:40:09] begin to shout don't dig out the wall
[1:40:11] but just sound the trumpet and the walls
[1:40:13] will fall down the blast of the trumpet
[1:40:15] will knock the walls down how foolish to
[1:40:17] the caral mind but God proved his word
[1:40:19] was true for the walls fell down amen
[1:40:23] one on top of the other they went
[1:40:25] straight up and they took the city are
[1:40:27] y'all hearing me they went straight up
[1:40:30] and they took the city amen God chose a
[1:40:32] simple method to reveal his word through
[1:40:35] prophets and he said Elijah simple sort
[1:40:37] of a person serve God's purpose he said
[1:40:40] now watch are you ready for this he just
[1:40:42] had sense enough to believe God simple
[1:40:45] that's it that's the kind of people God
[1:40:47] works hides himself is simple God
[1:40:49] identifies himself in the unidentified
[1:40:52] things he said God could take that
[1:40:54] simple man and put his words in his
[1:40:56] mouth it come into human lips he said
[1:40:58] now watch A Simple Man and the blood of
[1:41:00] bulls or goats first thing you know
[1:41:02] Moses a green fly began to fly around
[1:41:04] the next thing you know five pounds what
[1:41:06] was it was the word of God spoke through
[1:41:08] Moses the Creator because under the
[1:41:11] blood he was standing in the presence of
[1:41:13] God his own words wasn't his word I'm
[1:41:16] closing on this if you abide in me and
[1:41:19] my words abide in you then ask what you
[1:41:21] will and it shall
[1:41:23] be given to you where's the church
[1:41:25] standing at Let There Be frogs and there
[1:41:28] wasn't a frog in the country but in an
[1:41:30] hour's time brother Josh in in hour's
[1:41:33] time they were 10 foot deep in some
[1:41:35] places he said see what was it it was
[1:41:38] God the Creator hiding himself in a
[1:41:41] simple man I want to ask you something
[1:41:43] can I ask you something NE light if the
[1:41:45] blood of a bull or goat be used for a
[1:41:47] bleach which can only cover could put a
[1:41:50] man in position to speak the creative
[1:41:52] word of God and bring flies into
[1:41:54] existence then why would you stumble at
[1:41:57] The Bleach of Jesus Christ's blood when
[1:41:59] you could speak a squirrel or something
[1:42:01] into existence don't you do it don't you
[1:42:04] stumble over Simplicity but you believe
[1:42:07] that he still remains God hallelujah
[1:42:10] don't you stumble over the simple ways
[1:42:12] that God decides to deliver his children
[1:42:15] you believe he's still God are you
[1:42:17] hearing me you say brother and a simple
[1:42:19] people yeah a simple people often has
[1:42:22] been referred to as simple
[1:42:23] and you know what a simpleton is it's a
[1:42:25] person who's gullible or foolish enough
[1:42:28] to just believe what they
[1:42:30] hear I raised my hand brother Caleb and
[1:42:33] I say I am proud to be called a
[1:42:35] simpleton of the teachings of William
[1:42:37] Mary and brandham I am proud to be
[1:42:40] called a gullible foolish young preacher
[1:42:42] to stand and say what a prophet said
[1:42:45] listen friends it's more than a book
[1:42:47] it's more than a tape an entrance has
[1:42:50] been ministered unto you
[1:42:54] you don't have to stay where you're at
[1:42:56] are you hearing me you don't have to
[1:42:58] stay where you're at the preaching of
[1:43:00] the message of the hour in the
[1:43:02] Simplicity is opening a whole new world
[1:43:05] to you oh God it's opening a whole new
[1:43:09] world you say preacher I don't know if
[1:43:11] God's able look at your neighbor and say
[1:43:12] God's able you looked at the wrong one
[1:43:15] look at somebody else and say God's able
[1:43:17] brother Aaron God's able brother Tim
[1:43:20] God's able brother Joe God is able amen
[1:43:23] I say even like God is
[1:43:26] able Hallelujah brother Phillip God is
[1:43:29] able he's able to heal he's able to
[1:43:32] deliver he's able to restore he's able
[1:43:35] to refresh he's able to bring back the
[1:43:37] new again I say my God is Not on a
[1:43:40] holiday somewhere my God is right here
[1:43:43] in the preaching of the message of the
[1:43:46] hour and he's
[1:43:48] able I said he's able if you're able to
[1:43:52] believe he he's able to perform if
[1:43:54] you're able to take him at his word he's
[1:43:57] able to fulfill his word He's
[1:44:00] Able I said he's able brother Ben He's
[1:44:03] Able He's Able these stones to raise
[1:44:06] children under
[1:44:09] Abraham you know what the prod of God
[1:44:11] said he said God's able to heal aome or
[1:44:13] a fish or anything if he will bring his
[1:44:16] message forth and the people won't
[1:44:17] believe it then God will raise up a
[1:44:19] posum to believe it God can raise a dead
[1:44:22] fish he can raise a dead possum he can
[1:44:24] do what he wants
[1:44:26] to you know why because he's
[1:44:30] God now to reject the simple
[1:44:34] message God's simple message is to
[1:44:37] reject it God's simple way is to be
[1:44:41] destroyed
[1:44:43] eternally in other words everyone that
[1:44:47] refuse Jesus is perished to refuse the
[1:44:51] Simplicity of God is just not something
[1:44:55] you say well I made a mistake you don't
[1:44:57] do it that way God don't receive it that
[1:44:59] way you perish
[1:45:02] eternally are you hearing me brother
[1:45:06] says we better be thinking about
[1:45:07] something now it's got to be properly
[1:45:09] identified by God then if it is it's his
[1:45:12] word see oh like they rejected Moses
[1:45:15] rejected Elijah reject rejected John
[1:45:18] rejected Jesus of their days can I say
[1:45:21] this to you can I can I can I give this
[1:45:23] to you a message properly identified by
[1:45:26] God becomes the word and to refuse it is
[1:45:31] death a message properly identified by
[1:45:35] God becomes the word and to refuse it is
[1:45:38] death can you give me that first picture
[1:45:40] you say brother Ander what what are you
[1:45:42] showing us here amen when a message
[1:45:44] comes from God and is properly
[1:45:47] identified that message becomes the word
[1:45:51] h the the other one and to refuse it is
[1:45:53] death now to some that's a picture to
[1:45:57] some that's a man in the water amen
[1:46:01] baptizing amen somebody on the Ohio
[1:46:03] River amen but to the
[1:46:05] Believers come on church to the
[1:46:07] Believers that's more than just a man in
[1:46:10] the Ohio River baptizing in the 17th
[1:46:13] person the prophet of God said on the
[1:46:15] 17th person he said Out of Heaven amen
[1:46:18] come a whirlwind and a fire appeared and
[1:46:21] there was something spoke out of it you
[1:46:23] know what it said it said as John the
[1:46:25] Baptist was sent to forerun the first
[1:46:27] coming of Christ your message will forun
[1:46:30] the second coming and a prophet of God
[1:46:32] said this day this scripture is
[1:46:34] fulfilled in other words God hid himself
[1:46:38] in the Simplicity of the 17th baptism on
[1:46:42] the Ohio River in 1933 but then in 1950
[1:46:46] the next picture in Sam Houston Coliseum
[1:46:49] a prophet stands there amen under a

[1:52:21] Hope God have mercy even in the valley
[1:52:25] there's a door of hope y'all know what
[1:52:27] I'm talking about Israel was a winning
[1:52:29] people God fought their battles God
[1:52:32] stood with them they went from the
[1:52:34] Battle of Jericho William they went all
[1:52:36] the way down to the Battle of AI and the
[1:52:38] Bible says they whipped the devil at
[1:52:40] Jericho they went to Ai and they lost
[1:52:43] the battle Joshua said hold it there's
[1:52:45] something wrong we're not supposed to
[1:52:47] lose we are the people of God so he fell
[1:52:50] down on his face and he be to Crow to
[1:52:53] God and he said God what's the matter
[1:52:55] and God revealed to him Simplicity God
[1:52:58] revealed to him that there was sin in
[1:53:00] the
[1:53:01] camp the Bible showed him that the sin
[1:53:05] in the camp was in the family of achen
[1:53:07] he had taken a gold wedge and put it in
[1:53:10] his tent and the Bible says that Joshua
[1:53:13] went down there in Israel and they took
[1:53:15] aen and they took his family they took
[1:53:17] his tent and they killed them
[1:53:19] slaughtered them amen and they burnt
[1:53:21] their ashes Amen in the valley and they
[1:53:24] covered their ashes up with a
[1:53:27] rock and you know what the Bible called
[1:53:30] it in the valley of aor in the valley of
[1:53:33] aor they there they killed aen now
[1:53:36] here's what they done they went back to
[1:53:38] the battle and brother Mark when they
[1:53:39] got back in the battle they were
[1:53:41] victorious again when the sin was dealt
[1:53:45] with brother Jackson when the sin was
[1:53:48] dealt with they went back to the battle
[1:53:50] and they won now if you leave there and
[1:53:53] go to Hosea 2 you will read about a
[1:53:56] woman and the Bible talks about Hosea
[1:53:58] amen Mary and a harlot and having kids
[1:54:01] by right and the Bible says it's almost
[1:54:03] as if it's a story of redemption you
[1:54:05] know what the Bible says oh God the
[1:54:08] Bible says amen amen that God could not
[1:54:11] throw Israel
[1:54:12] away no matter how much wrong they done
[1:54:16] no matter how many times they fail hear
[1:54:18] me young people God could not throw
[1:54:20] Israel away because they were part of
[1:54:22] him so what God done in this story was
[1:54:26] he reveals to Hosea the reason why I
[1:54:29] cannot throw Israel away is because
[1:54:31] she's my wife she's a part of me and you
[1:54:34] know what he says he says now take the
[1:54:36] that daughter and I will Allure her to
[1:54:39] the valley of acor and will give her a
[1:54:42] Door of Hope brother Joe you know what
[1:54:44] that word aure means it means I will
[1:54:46] open and what I open will attract her
[1:54:49] attention in other words in the days of
[1:54:52] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[1:54:55] shall begin to sound amen the mystery of
[1:54:57] God should be finished the word should
[1:54:59] be open and it will become the
[1:55:01] attraction on the mountain it'll become
[1:55:04] the attraction in the bride and I will
[1:55:06] Allure
[1:55:07] her sir to the valley of

[1:55:39] out yeah if he's going to bury us in a
[1:55:42] valley he better pick the right one out
[1:55:46] because he thought the valley of acor
[1:55:49] was just a horrible thing because of
[1:55:51] what happened to a
[1:55:52] but God turned that and said if I could
[1:55:55] take Israel and make her deal with her
[1:55:57] sin then I could raise her back up and
[1:56:00] put her back on The Winning Side then
[1:56:02] anybody that gets in the same condition

[2:01:22] being made
[2:01:23] manifest they're too smart and too
[2:01:25] educated brother sister to believe the
[2:01:27] simple form of the written word they
[2:01:30] want to put their own interpretation to

[2:01:34] see it does mean that listen may I say
[2:01:36] this right quick now even the visions

[2:01:47] say what the Visions
[2:01:50] say
[2:01:53] Hallelujah says where is our faith to
[2:01:55] believe the simple word of God just what
[2:01:58] God Said take him in his word god hides
[2:02:01] himself now in Simplicity in a humble
[2:02:03] little Bunch but one of these days he'll
[2:02:06] manifest himself as he always has in the
[2:02:08] days
[2:02:10] past I hope and trust he says that this
[2:02:12] message will produce what is intended to
[2:02:14] do that it'll get you to a place that
[2:02:16] you don't look for Flowery things or
[2:02:18] when you see God in greatness you look
[2:02:20] how humble it is then you'll see God

[2:02:28] Lord humble
[2:02:30] me humble me all over again to this
[2:02:34] message maybe I've gotten a little bit
[2:02:36] too carried away in my ideas about how
[2:02:39] God can't move in this situation and God
[2:02:41] can't fix this thing and God can't move
[2:02:44] in this condition but the prophet of God
[2:02:46] says humble yourself just be humble
[2:02:50] don't try to be peculiar just love Jesus
[2:02:53] see and say this Lord if there's any G
[2:02:56] in my heart if there's anything wrong

[2:03:04] that oh I want to be numbered as one of
[2:03:06] them in the day Lord and I see that day
[2:03:14] approaching how many can say Lord draw
[2:03:17] me

[2:03:20] of the message of the hour

[2:03:27] confession of
[2:03:28] Faith draw me back lord to where I
[2:03:31] didn't have to back up on my confession
[2:03:34] I didn't have to question my confession
[2:03:37] I could just stand there and simply
[2:03:39] believe that God still
[2:03:44] moves how many can say Lord let the
[2:03:46] energy of the Holy Ghost
[2:03:48] tonight let it carry the words of this
[2:03:50] message
[2:03:52] when I'm sitting at home listening to a
[2:03:54] tape let the energy of the Holy Ghost
[2:03:56] carry the
[2:03:58] words
[2:03:59] Hallelujah from the voice of the seventh
[2:04:02] angel into my heart and let a sound of
[2:04:05] Amen come out let a sound of Freedom

[2:04:37] the Simplicity of
[2:04:39] God I humble myself to the pillar of
[2:04:42] fire I humble myself to the things a
[2:04:45] prophet taught I humble myself to the
[2:04:48] supernatural I humble myself to the
[2:04:50] anointing
[2:04:53] Hallelujah everything that's in the word
[2:04:56] from the teaching to the preaching to
[2:04:58] the gifts of the Spirit to the
[2:05:00] manifestation of the power of God to the
[2:05:02] Seven Seals to whatever is in the word I
[2:05:04] humble myself to it
[2:05:06] tonight Heavenly Father Lord all across
[2:05:10] this building tonight Lord the pillar of
[2:05:12] fire I believe has been moving across
[2:05:14] hearts and lives now father I'm fir I am
[2:05:17] a firm believer that wherever the
[2:05:20] message of the hour is preached
[2:05:22] it is a Door of Hope Lord it is an
[2:05:26] entrance that's being
[2:05:28] ministered father there's one thing we
[2:05:30] found that a door is an entrance as well
[2:05:34] as an
[2:05:35] exit Lord if you go through a door
[2:05:38] you're exiting one thing and you're
[2:05:41] entering into something
[2:05:42] else now Lord as you sent a prophet in
[2:05:45] this age to take the Book of Revelation
[2:05:48] to take the things that theologians and
[2:05:50] Scholars had so stum tumbled over
[2:05:52] confused and complicated but he comes in
[2:05:55] 1963 after meeting a consolation of
[2:05:58] angels and steps behind a pull pit and
[2:06:02] says now I'm going to lay a
[2:06:03] foundation of
[2:06:05] Simplicity for this upcoming meeting
[2:06:08] week of meetings before he goes to the
