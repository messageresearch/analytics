[0:00] my faithful martyr who was slain among
[0:02] you where Satan dwelleth but I have a
[0:05] few things against thee because thou
[0:08] Hast there them that hold the doctrine
[0:10] of balum who taught baac to cast a
[0:13] stumbling block before the children of
[0:15] Israel to eat things sacrificed unto
[0:18] idols and to commit
[0:20] fornications verse 15 so hast thou also
[0:25] them that hold the doctrine of the
[0:26] nicians which thing I hate
[0:30] repent or else I will come unto thee
[0:32] quickly and will fight against them with
[0:34] the sword of my mouth he that hath an
[0:36] ear let him hear what the spirit saith
[0:39] unto the churches to him that overcometh
[0:41] will I give to eat of the Hidden mana
[0:44] and will give him a white stone and in
[0:46] the stone a new name written which no
[0:49] man knoweth saveth him that receiveth it
[0:52] amen I pray that the Lord will add His
[0:53] blessings as you have your seats
[0:57] tonight and as we look at this we're
[0:59] going to look at some things and maybe
[1:01] like I said a lot of it may be very
[1:03] informational as we go down through the
[1:05] history of maybe ancient religions such
[1:07] as Babylon and things like that um but
[1:10] but what we want to see is how this
[1:13] glorious gospel that started out there
[1:15] on the book of Acts and its perfect
[1:17] truth ends up in a situation where it is
[1:20] today where people are so far off from
[1:23] that original word what was it that that
[1:26] took it in that direction how did we get
[1:28] to where we're at today and just a quick
[1:31] reminder here as we look at the the map
[1:33] of Asia Minor we're studying about
[1:35] pergamus here on this map in the
[1:37] northern part it is is called pergamum
[1:40] which was the ancient name for it it is
[1:42] the same place and this age would be
[1:44] between the years 312 and
[1:47] 606 ad for those of you who know a
[1:50] little bit about history this would be
[1:52] during the time of the fall of what we
[1:54] would call the Roman Empire during this
[1:57] time uh Pagan Rome or the Roman Empire
[2:00] is actually in Decline and and is and is
[2:05] falling um the messenger of this age the
[2:08] messenger of this age is Martin brother
[2:11] brandham says using our god-given rule
[2:13] for choosing the messenger to each age
[2:16] that is we choose the one whose Ministry
[2:18] most closely approximates that of the
[2:20] first messenger Paul we unhesitatingly
[2:23] declare the pergan messenger to be
[2:27] Martin and I I wanted to say as as we
[2:30] start this I want us to remember that we
[2:33] are studying an age so we're studying a
[2:36] period of time okay and and and and
[2:39] things that happened during that age and
[2:41] yet at times it may seem like we're
[2:43] studying a
[2:44] city okay and the reason for that is
[2:47] because I guess in some ways we are but
[2:50] it's because the the seven churches in
[2:52] these Seven Cities had
[2:55] characteristics that would be manifested
[2:57] later in this time period period that
[3:00] we're studying so brother Bram said it
[3:02] like this he said the seven churches
[3:04] were especially picked from all other
[3:07] churches for their
[3:09] characteristics which same
[3:11] characteristics would be found in the
[3:13] successive ages centuries later and just
[3:17] for an example to bring it down to what
[3:18] we're trying to say we we read about the
[3:21] leoan church that was just a church in a
[3:24] city there in Asia Minor 1900 years ago
[3:29] but now we are living in the age that
[3:31] that church represented okay and the
[3:35] characteristics of that church are now
[3:37] coming to fruition in the very age that
[3:40] we live in so sometimes don't lose sight
[3:42] of the fact that we're studying what
[3:44] took place in in a time period and in an
[3:47] age so so what we're going to try to do
[3:49] is take all the scripture and what it
[3:51] said about that church and then relate
[3:53] it all and see how it unfolds in time
[3:56] and how it unfill how how it fulfills
[3:58] what was spoken in Prophecy so back to
[4:02] Martin Luther brother Bram said by signs
[4:04] and wonders by by the by the by excuse
[4:09] me Martin by signs and wonders by the
[4:12] power of the spirit Martin was truly
[4:14] Vindicated as the messenger of that age
[4:17] but not only was he gifted by a great
[4:19] ministry he himself was forever true to
[4:22] the word of God he fought organization
[4:25] he with stood sin in high places he
[4:28] championed the truth in word and deed
[4:30] and lived out a full life of Christian
[4:33] Victory and and one thing I want to say
[4:35] is I want that to be the testimony of me
[4:37] when I'm gone that not no matter what
[4:39] Deeds no matter what powerful things may
[4:42] it be said that I lived out a full life
[4:45] of Christian Victory amen and one of the
[4:47] things that we read tonight we're going
[4:49] to start in verse 13 and we're going to
[4:51] talk about where Satan's SE seed is
[4:54] because he says here I Know Thy works
[4:56] and where thou dwellest even where Satan
[4:59] SE seed is and thou holdest fast my name
[5:02] and H has not denied my faith even in
[5:04] those days wherein Antipas was my
[5:06] faithful martyr who was slain among you
[5:09] where Satan dwelleth now there's some
[5:12] interesting things said in here that we
[5:15] want to get into because pergamus was
[5:18] not the original seat of Satan it's
[5:22] always been been been known that Babylon
[5:25] had always been literally and
[5:27] figuratively his headquarter ERS it was
[5:30] in Babylon that satanic worship had its
[5:33] origin now we're going way back before
[5:36] the church ages here we're going back to
[5:37] the Book of Genesis it was in Babylon
[5:40] that Satan worship had its origin and
[5:43] and and I want us to see in scripture
[5:45] and in
[5:46] history that that the things that we
[5:48] teach you because sometimes I understand
[5:50] I was raised in the message and
[5:52] sometimes you're like well that's our
[5:53] idea that's what we believe and true we
[5:57] do but what I want us to see is in
[5:58] scripture and in history that what we
[6:00] hold to as the truth is found there what
[6:03] we hold to in truth is found in the
[6:05] scriptures what we hold to as truth is
[6:08] found in the histories the errors of the
[6:10] Catholic church and the the
[6:12] denominational world can be found in
[6:15] history um these aren't just our ideas
[6:18] and and what we preach so if we if we'll
[6:20] go back and look in Genesis
[6:23] 10 8 through1 it says and Kush begat
[6:27] Nimrod he be began to be a mighty one in
[6:30] the earth he was a mighty Hunter before
[6:33] the Lord wherefore it is said even as
[6:36] Nimrod the mighty Hunter before the Lord
[6:39] and the beginning of his kingdom was
[6:41] Babel and Eric and aad and Kaa in the
[6:45] land of shanar so we we know here if we
[6:48] if we know our Sunday school lesson and
[6:50] you uh if you remember from back in your
[6:52] days in Sunday school we find over in
[6:54] Genesis 11 that the whole earth spoke
[6:57] one language and the whole whole earth
[6:59] spoke one language and there in sh
[7:01] shanar they they began to build a city
[7:04] and a tower we in Sunday school we would
[7:07] know it as the the Tower of Babel okay
[7:10] and and they began to build this Tower
[7:12] but God knew that their intention was
[7:15] for evil he knew it wasn't for good it
[7:18] was it was so if the floods ever came
[7:20] again they could live their life however
[7:22] they wanted and they could run up in
[7:24] this Tower and Escape judgment but it
[7:26] was also it was a monument to man it was
[7:29] a Monument to to how great that they
[7:31] thought they were and God knew that
[7:33] their intention was for evil and so he
[7:36] allows their their tongues to be
[7:38] confused and the people there to be
[7:42] scattered Babel is the original name for
[7:46] Babylon all right so when we talk about
[7:48] satanic worship beginning in Babylon
[7:50] this is where we're taking it it means
[7:54] confusion it was founded by Kush the son
[7:57] of ham and it was brought to Power by
[8:01] Nimrod the son of
[8:04] kush and so what we want to see is how
[8:08] did the seed of Satan and here's what
[8:10] we're focusing on here as it relates to
[8:12] the Affairs of man and to the Affairs of
[8:14] worship go from
[8:17] Babylon to where here in the
[8:19] scripture God is saying that it's in
[8:21] pergamus that this is the seed of
[8:24] Satan what how did this transfer happen
[8:27] and what was this Babylonian
[8:29] religion how then did did did the
[8:32] religion of Babylon then become
[8:34] intertwined with Christianity to to form
[8:37] the hybrid thing that people today call
[8:40] Christianity we're going to continue to
[8:42] look here at Nimrod and and his
[8:46] desires says Nimrod set out to
[8:48] accomplish three
[8:50] things he wanted to build a strong
[8:52] nation which he did he wanted to
[8:55] propagate his own religion which he did
[8:58] and he wanted to to make a name for
[9:00] himself which he also accomplished
[9:04] during this time Babylon became the very
[9:06] head of gold amongst the world
[9:08] governments you know the vision there in
[9:10] the Bible where where the statue was
[9:12] made of different materials and the head
[9:13] of gold was at the top that was the
[9:16] Babylonian Kingdom and and his religion
[9:19] invaded the whole world and it became
[9:22] the
[9:23] basis the basis of every system of
[9:27] idolatry and the theme for all mythology
[9:30] if you ever studied mythology in school
[9:32] you can trace it back to Babylon if
[9:34] you've ever studied any idolatry you can
[9:36] trace it back to Babylon it all goes
[9:40] back to Babylon and and when you study
[9:43] those things the names of gods they may
[9:44] differ depending on the language that
[9:46] the people speak um but it was all
[9:49] started in Babylon and it's still in
[9:51] practice to this day and so brother Bron
[9:54] would pick up on this and he would say
[9:56] ancient histories agree with the Bible
[9:59] that this babylonish religion was most
[10:02] certainly not the original religion of
[10:06] Earth's early people it was the first to
[10:11] drift away from the original Faith but
[10:14] it was not the original one so we know
[10:18] that this religion to where they
[10:20] worshiped many gods was not original it
[10:22] wasn't so from the beginning this
[10:24] religion where they worshiped nature was
[10:26] not the original that was not the
[10:29] original most religious historians say
[10:32] that originally the people of Earth
[10:35] worshiped one God so if we're going to
[10:38] go back to the original just like we
[10:40] always talk about as it relates to the
[10:42] New Testament going back to Pentecost
[10:44] and and going back to the original if
[10:46] we're going to trace it far enough back
[10:48] you got to go beyond Babylon to get back
[10:50] to the original worship original worship
[10:53] was the worship of one God Supreme
[10:58] eternal invisible who by the word of his
[11:01] mouth spoke all things into existence
[11:03] and that in his character he was loving
[11:06] and good and just that is the original
[11:09] religion of the world and of
[11:12] mankind but as always Satan will always
[11:16] try to
[11:17] corrupt he's not going to be happy
[11:19] seeing God receiving praise he's not
[11:22] going to be happy seeing God was because
[11:24] that's what Satan wanted even in the
[11:25] beginning is he wanted worship he wanted
[11:28] to be praise and I want to remind you
[11:30] tonight that still what he wants be
[11:33] careful where your life gives praise not
[11:36] just on I know we come here and we
[11:38] praise God on Wednesdays and we praise
[11:40] God on Sundays but what where is your
[11:43] time going on Monday and where is your
[11:45] time going on Tuesday and Thursday and
[11:47] Friday and Saturday is your lifegiving
[11:50] praise is it split between God and Satan
[11:53] because Satan is always after your
[11:55] praise he's after your time and your
[11:58] devotion and he wants you and when you
[11:59] give time to him and you give time to
[12:02] his idols and you give time to the
[12:04] things of the world you're getting
[12:06] praise drawn away from God and drawn to
[12:08] the
[12:09] devil he wants to draw worship away from
[12:12] the one true and living God and and so
[12:15] what he does here in Babylon what's the
[12:17] point of it what's the point of this
[12:19] false religion by setting up his own
[12:22] false religion that he's the author of
[12:25] then not only does it draw worship away
[12:27] from God but it now draws worship unto
[12:30] himself it's being drawn to himself and
[12:33] brother Bram says monotheism if you
[12:35] don't know monotheism mono means one
[12:38] that's that's a religion where there's
[12:39] one God turn to polytheism the worship
[12:43] of many gods in
[12:45] babyon the devil's lie and the devil's
[12:48] Mysteries rose up against the truth of
[12:50] God and the mysteries of God in that
[12:55] City just some things I want to point
[12:57] out and see if it sounds famili familiar
[12:59] to you in Babylon now this is way before
[13:03] Christianity they had mother and child
[13:06] Worship in the form of the Goddess the
[13:08] mother of Babylon s sarus and her son
[13:12] nenus history shows us that ninus was
[13:15] actually
[13:16] Nimrod his father was kush and he was
[13:19] the father of the polytheistic system by
[13:22] which man began to worship many gods
[13:25] there in Babylon they began to worship
[13:27] their ancestors they began to worship
[13:30] nature it was in Babylon that Gods
[13:33] became identified with the sun and gods
[13:35] became identified with the moon
[13:38] creatures were worshiped in Babylon and
[13:40] we see over in pergamus we covered this
[13:42] last time that in the city of pergamus
[13:44] they actually had a live serpent in the
[13:47] temple that they would worship so it
[13:49] came all the way to the place where the
[13:51] very creature that represented the devil
[13:54] was now in the temple receiving
[13:57] worship
[13:59] and the reason I'm going through all
[14:00] this is just to tie in so you understand
[14:03] that all the idolatry and the things
[14:05] that we see in so-called Christianity
[14:07] Today has its roots and it ties in
[14:11] Babylon it has its roots and it ties in
[14:13] the tradition of paganism there's no
[14:16] place in Christianity for it Kush was
[14:19] called Bale and Bale in Roman mythology
[14:22] was Janice brother brandham says he is
[14:25] pictured as having two faces he carried
[14:28] a club by which he confounded and
[14:30] Scattered the people exactly what
[14:33] happened there at the tower he says thus
[14:35] that we find that kush of the Bible the
[14:38] original rebel against monotheism was
[14:40] called Bell Bellis Hermes Janice Etc
[14:44] among the ancient peoples he purported
[14:46] to bring Revelations and interpretations
[14:49] from the gods to the people in so doing
[14:52] he calls the wrath of God to scatter the
[14:54] people bringing Division and confusion
[14:58] brother Brown says says the polytheistic
[14:59] religion of the enemy began with the
[15:02] trinitarian doctrine it was way back
[15:05] there in Antiquity that the one God and
[15:08] three persons idea came into existence
[15:11] now how was this Trinity expressed it
[15:14] was expressed by an equilateral triangle
[15:17] even as it is expressed in Rome today
[15:21] strange the Hebrews did not have such a
[15:24] concept now who is right the Hebrews are
[15:28] the
[15:29] Babylonians so here we are in the in the
[15:32] third
[15:34] Age and and way past Babylon and we're
[15:37] here in the third age and it's very easy
[15:40] for the pagans to accept Christianity
[15:43] wrapped up in all this ancient Pagan
[15:46] ritual and tradition it wasn't no big
[15:48] leap for them to accept the Trinity it
[15:51] was no big leap for them to accept a
[15:53] holy mother or praying to Saints or
[15:56] praying to ancestors because it's what
[15:58] they they had always done this is how
[16:01] they had always worshiped but now if you
[16:03] just take Christian names and add it to
[16:05] the form they've always been following
[16:09] it was easy to make that transition it
[16:12] was simple for them they already
[16:13] worshiped the great God mother they
[16:16] already worshiped the son God there was
[16:18] already a place of worship for the gods
[16:20] and their
[16:22] sons brother brandham says
[16:27] this
[16:35] just remember this one thing from now on
[16:39] I want you to take this because you can
[16:41] apply this to any aspect of your life
[16:43] these records are facts and this is a
[16:46] fact Satan is a liar and the father of
[16:49] lies and whenever he comes with light it
[16:52] is still a lie notice even if it's light
[16:56] it's still a lie because he cannot tell
[16:58] the truth he's a murderer and his
[17:00] doctrine of the Trinity has destroyed
[17:02] the multitudes and will destroy until
[17:06] Jesus comes now we see why when we read
[17:10] the scripture sometimes when you see why
[17:13] the scripture would speak so against
[17:15] Babylon why isn't it calling out and
[17:17] saying
[17:18] Rome because where did this stuff
[17:20] originate at it originates in Babylon
[17:24] you we see Satan identified with Babylon
[17:26] in Isaiah 14 we see him all say uh uh
[17:29] identified in Revelation 17 and 18 why
[17:33] because Babylon is where it all began
[17:37] Babylon was the seat of
[17:40] Satan so then why and we come back to
[17:42] where we started does it say here I Know
[17:45] Thy works and where thou dwellest even
[17:48] where Satan's seed is thou holdest fast
[17:52] my name and has not denied my faith even
[17:54] in those days where in Antipas was my
[17:56] faithful martyr who was slain among you
[17:59] where Satan dwelleth well the Bible is
[18:03] not talking about Babylon here it's
[18:04] talking about
[18:06] pergamus so why because as the religion
[18:09] of Babylon had spread across the world
[18:11] it had taken a great stronghold there in
[18:14] the city of pergamus and brother
[18:15] brandham says that Babylonian priest had
[18:19] fled from Babylon when it was conquered
[18:21] by the mes and by the Persians and they
[18:23] had come to pergamus and it had now
[18:26] become the very headquarters of their
[18:28] worship from where they pushed out their
[18:30] religion so as they fled Babylon they
[18:33] came and they brought their rights and
[18:34] they brought their rituals and they
[18:36] bought their traditions and they set up
[18:38] here amongst other pagan people and from
[18:40] here it began to spread and so I began
[18:43] to do some digging and I found this very
[18:45] interesting in history history tells us
[18:48] plainly that it was through the
[18:50] relationship with
[18:52] pergamus that the religion of baby
[18:54] Babylon began to grow strong and take
[18:56] control of Rome so it's connect the dots
[18:59] you got you got Babylon and then we see
[19:02] it over here in Rome but the dot in
[19:05] between was pergamus and I found this in
[19:07] history I found this very interesting it
[19:09] says the Second Punic War between Rome
[19:12] and Carthage was still
[19:15] continuing and they consulted the holy
[19:17] books so Rome consults their holy books
[19:20] known as the cilon books and they found
[19:23] verses saying that if a foreigner were
[19:25] to make war on Italy he would be
[19:27] defeated if the matrium Magna idea
[19:31] that's a language I don't speak but
[19:34] interpreted the great mother Godus was
[19:37] brought to Rome additionally an unusual
[19:40] number of meteor showers had been seen
[19:42] the interpretation from the Oracle was
[19:44] that Rome needed to start a cult in Rome
[19:48] to the mother goddess in order to win
[19:50] the war so according to historian Livy
[19:54] adelus who is the priest brother
[19:56] brandham actually speaks of in the
[19:57] church AG
[19:58] book receives a delegation from Rome and
[20:02] hands over to them the sacred
[20:05] stone trace it back from pergamus to
[20:08] Babylon and now here's the Romans in
[20:09] pergamus and the Very priest hands over
[20:13] the sacred stone which the natives
[20:16] declared to be the mother of God and B
[20:20] them carry it to Rome the ancient
[20:23] goddess cbel was thus introduced to Rome
[20:26] as the Magna
[20:28] or the great
[20:30] mother well no wonder that they pray to
[20:33] the mother of God no wonder Mary is
[20:36] worshiped it just carries right back
[20:38] over into the
[20:41] paganism it says right here brother
[20:43] brandham actually said this and I didn't
[20:46] find it till I got down to the end of
[20:47] the chapter but I already read this and
[20:49] he says it almost identically this comes
[20:51] from history it says when atalis the
[20:53] pontiff the king of pergamus died in BC
[20:57] 1 33 he bequeathed the headship of the
[21:01] Babylonian priesthood to
[21:04] Rome when the austraian came to Italy
[21:07] from Lydia the region of pergamus they
[21:10] brought with them the Babylonian
[21:11] religion and rights they set up a
[21:13] pontiff who was head of the priesthood
[21:16] later the Romans accepted this pontis as
[21:18] their civil ruler Julius Caesar was made
[21:21] pontiff of the order in BC 74 in BC 63
[21:26] he was made Supreme pontiff of the
[21:28] Babylonian order thus becoming heir to
[21:31] the rights of the title of atalis
[21:33] pontiff of pergamus who made Rome his
[21:36] Heir by Will thus the first Roman
[21:39] Emperor became the head of the
[21:41] Babylonian priesthood and Rome the
[21:44] successor of
[21:46] Babylon these things aren't just made up
[21:50] these things are in history now it's
[21:53] clear how the succession of pagan
[21:55] polytheistic worship started in Babylon
[21:58] and ends up with its seat and its power
[22:00] in Rome which we're going to see later
[22:03] as we begin to move into this now
[22:05] becomes intermingled with
[22:07] Christianity to form what we know today
[22:10] is the Roman Catholic
[22:13] Church Revelations
[22:15] 2:14 he says but I have a few things
[22:17] against thee because thou Hast them that
[22:20] hold the doctrine of balum who taught
[22:22] baac to cast a stumbling block before
[22:24] the children of Israel to eat things
[22:26] sacrificed under Idol and to commit
[22:29] fornication so hast thou also them that
[22:32] hold the doctrine of the nicians which
[22:35] thing I hate so in this age what we find
[22:40] is God denounces two doctrines the
[22:43] doctrine of balum which caused Israel to
[22:45] fall into idolatry and the doctrine of
[22:48] the nians which had only been needs in
[22:51] the deeds in the Ephesian age if you'll
[22:53] remember you've heard about we've
[22:55] preached a lot about nicians and nianis
[22:58] but before this it was only Deeds but
[23:01] now it has grown to a place where it's
[23:03] known as
[23:05] doctrines when when we see the
[23:07] denouncement there in verse 14 and 15
[23:10] and it's telling us that in this age
[23:11] there's those in the church that have
[23:13] the doctrine of Baum and there's those
[23:15] in the church that have the doctrine of
[23:16] the nicians and we see that God also
[23:19] calls it the seed of Satan it becomes
[23:21] quite clear that the religion of Babylon
[23:24] has already taken a hold of the church
[23:26] at this point it's no longer a pure
[23:29] church I it's no longer just the the
[23:32] True Vine as we would say but how how
[23:35] did it get to this place how here in the
[23:37] third age has the false Vine gotten such
[23:39] a tight grip how has this ancient
[23:42] religion of Babylon gotten so ingrained
[23:45] in the church that started out pure
[23:47] we're talking about we're we're
[23:48] literally just a couple hundred years
[23:50] away from the day of Pentecost and yet
[23:53] how has it got to this
[23:55] place brother brandham goes into it here
[23:57] and describes it so it's quite easy to
[23:59] understand he says when the Christians
[24:02] mainly Jews by birth understand
[24:04] originally most Christians were
[24:07] Jews okay so when the Christians mainly
[24:10] Jews by birth were scattered abroad from
[24:12] Jerusalem they went everywhere preaching
[24:14] the gospel particularly in synagogues
[24:17] well what kind of people would you find
[24:18] in
[24:19] synagogues Jews so the majority of their
[24:23] converts were once again Jews now this
[24:25] is building up to something the th
[24:28] within 3 years or about in 36 ad the
[24:32] gospel had been taken to Rome by Junius
[24:35] and by adronicus and you find their
[24:37] names there in Romans 16:7 Paul says
[24:40] salute andronicus and junea for my
[24:42] Kinsmen my Kinsmen and my fellow
[24:45] prisoners who are note among the
[24:47] apostles so they're called Apostles they
[24:49] were brought the gospel who also were in
[24:52] Christ before me so as Paul writes this
[24:55] letter to the Romans he addresses and us
[24:58] and Junius as brothers and apostles and
[25:02] and because they they were there in the
[25:03] work in Rome and what happened in Rome
[25:05] as the gospel flourished the church was
[25:08] flourishing I mean this wasn't some
[25:10] little work there I mean but Paul wrote
[25:12] a letter to the Romans there was quite a
[25:15] work there there was a church there that
[25:16] was flourishing and
[25:18] growing but the problem was it's it's
[25:22] not necessarily a problem but it becomes
[25:23] a problem that the majority of the
[25:25] church there was Jews and the Jews were
[25:27] having great troubles amongst themselves
[25:30] there were factions and they were
[25:32] arguing and some of it was over
[25:34] Christianity some of it was just over
[25:35] Jewish things right cultural things but
[25:38] also there was a great movement amongst
[25:40] the Jews that were fighting for more
[25:43] what we would call um political freedoms
[25:46] within the city of Rome and it was
[25:48] causing a political upheaval so in order
[25:51] to deal with this Emperor Claudius just
[25:53] says we're going to expel all Jews from
[25:55] the city no Jew can stay in in the city
[25:58] and all Jews are kicked out of Rome
[26:00] they're gone so without the Jews there
[26:05] what's left behind is a very small
[26:07] fragment of the Church of
[26:10] Rome the the Christian church that had
[26:12] been there and it had a great impact
[26:14] because most of the Christians are now
[26:16] gone most of the early leaders of this
[26:19] church were Jews and now the leaders of
[26:21] the church are
[26:23] gone and because of this brother Bram
[26:26] says with the Jews banished
[26:28] from the city the backbone of that
[26:30] little church was practically broken
[26:33] perhaps even the elders had been Jewish
[26:35] and so they would be gone the flock
[26:37] would be unattended and since the word
[26:39] had not been written as a god it would
[26:42] be very easy for this little flock to
[26:45] drift or be inundated by the
[26:47] philosophers and the pagans of that day
[26:51] in other words the elders that were
[26:52] there to keep the Wolves Out weren't
[26:54] there the ones that were there to to
[26:57] teach them in the word and teach them
[26:59] the truth weren't there so even the
[27:01] though these were believers they were
[27:03] easily swayed by Winds of Doctrine they
[27:05] were easily swayed when somebody said
[27:07] well doesn't this make sense and doesn't
[27:09] this make sense and the elders weren't
[27:11] there to protect them from these
[27:13] teachings and without proper leadership
[27:16] the church in Rome began to slide into
[27:18] false doctrines it began to slide into
[27:22] paganism and Pagan rituals began to come
[27:25] into church under Christian titles
[27:27] things that we spent the first 15 20
[27:29] minutes talking about things from
[27:31] Babylon now just rebranded with new
[27:34] names and packaged as the gospel and
[27:38] these people it was easy for them to
[27:40] take that step because it was familiar
[27:42] it was something that they
[27:43] knew and then after 13 years andronicus
[27:47] and Junius are allowed back in the city
[27:50] and they come back to Rome only to find
[27:52] altars set up in the church where
[27:54] incense is burned and and Pagan rituals
[27:56] are carried out out to
[28:00] ancestors brother brandham says the
[28:02] established leaders of the church now
[28:04] we're talking about the church at Rome
[28:05] there's new leadership now there there's
[28:07] been 13 years without the elders W
[28:10] without the the the the ones that were
[28:12] grounded in the gospel and new leaders
[28:14] have risen up and they're not the good
[28:16] kind he says these established leaders
[28:19] of that church could not be approached
[28:21] in other words what are we dealing with
[28:22] here nickan ISM we're the priest you
[28:25] can't come talk to us this is how we do
[28:27] it y'all they were unapproachable they
[28:30] had been separated into a different
[28:32] class so with the few who had tried to
[28:35] remain faithful they started a new
[28:37] church or the second Church of Rome and
[28:41] God graciously worked amongst them by
[28:44] signs and wonders so that they grew in
[28:47] even a third church was started brother
[28:50] Brown says and though the first church
[28:52] was reproached for being Pagan and not
[28:54] Christian in its worship it would not
[28:57] give give up its title but remained and
[29:00] Still Remains The First Church of Rome
[29:03] the Roman Catholic Church that church
[29:08] became the Roman Catholic church but
[29:10] what stood out to me right here is it
[29:12] says with the few who had tried to
[29:15] remain faithful that they started a new
[29:17] church and God graciously worked among
[29:19] them listen if you'll remain faithful it
[29:22] doesn't matter what everybody else is
[29:24] doing if you'll remain faithful it
[29:26] doesn't matter what this chur church is
[29:27] doing or that church you know what let's
[29:29] let's go beyond that let's bring it down
[29:30] individual it don't matter what your
[29:32] friend is doing or what this is doing if
[29:34] you'll remain faithful God will work in
[29:36] your life God will move in your life if
[29:39] you will just remain faithful and true
[29:41] to the
[29:43] word that first church began to thrive
[29:46] now when we use the word Thrive here we
[29:48] don't mean
[29:49] spiritually we mean they began to become
[29:52] powerful the first church began to
[29:54] thrive and multiply so in numbers that
[29:57] the Emperors and various officials of
[29:59] the government actually favored that
[30:01] church for political reasons now this is
[30:04] where the church gains real power once
[30:06] again not power from God but power from
[30:10] man thus when the leaders of the First
[30:13] Church of Rome found themselves in
[30:15] favor they took the opportunity to turn
[30:18] the government against the True
[30:20] Believers and demand their persecution
[30:24] unless they came into their fold they
[30:26] recognized
[30:27] that their numbers had grown so big that
[30:30] they had great political power because
[30:32] they had influence and they had wealth
[30:35] and they begin to turn the government
[30:37] against the True Vine we can take this
[30:39] all the way back we've been teaching
[30:40] about the True Vine and false Vine all
[30:42] the way back to the Book of Genesis and
[30:44] that false Vine hates that True Vine and
[30:47] it begins to turn the power of the
[30:49] government against the True Vine and
[30:51] begin to persecute them and polycarp
[30:55] who's one that we've spoken briefly
[30:56] about
[30:58] traveled 1500 miles to come to Rome to
[31:01] try to speak to the leaders of this
[31:03] first church to plead with them to not
[31:06] go down this road to turn from their
[31:07] Wicked Ways to to get away from the
[31:10] paganism and things of that nature when
[31:12] he gets there he Witnesses for himself
[31:15] so-called Christians bowing before
[31:18] images named after Apostles and Saints
[31:21] burning candles and incense upon the
[31:23] altars celebrating Passover in the name
[31:26] of Easter
[31:29] brother Brown says God spoke through him
[31:31] just as he was leaving from Hosea 4 said
[31:34] Ephraim is married to his idols let him
[31:37] alone and polycarp leaves and never
[31:41] returns so this brings us to a place a
[31:44] term you may hear if you've ever studied
[31:47] even American history a little bit we
[31:49] would say the separation of church in
[31:51] state and what that's talking about is
[31:53] religious Affairs and political Affairs
[31:56] are not supposed to be intertwined but
[31:58] what we find here is the marriage of
[32:00] church and state when the true church
[32:03] would not incorporate Pagan festivals
[32:05] and worship the false Vine would use
[32:08] their power in government to bring
[32:11] persecution they would not they would
[32:13] not do as he requested so he prevailed
[32:16] upon the government officials to
[32:17] persecute the Believers hailing them
[32:20] into court casting them into prison and
[32:23] even meeting out death to many brother
[32:26] Brown says for syus Severus was
[32:29] prevailed upon by kalistus to kill
[32:32] 7,000 at thessalonica because these True
[32:36] Believers celebrated the Passover
[32:38] according to the Lord Jesus not
[32:40] according to the worship of a starte
[32:44] listen I've said it a bunch of times I
[32:46] want to say it again don't ever forget
[32:48] what other people have had to go through
[32:51] just to worship
[32:52] God don't take for granted the fact that
[32:55] you're sitting here tonight and free
[32:57] Freedom don't take for granted that we
[32:59] can gather on Wednesday and Sunday and
[33:01] worship god with our whole heart openly
[33:03] and and unashamed and unafraid people
[33:06] have given their life by the
[33:09] millions by the millions just to call on
[33:12] the name of Jesus and in this time
[33:14] that's what's going on already the false
[33:17] Vine was turning
[33:19] loose it's anger against the Living God
[33:22] by killing the elect even as did its
[33:25] forbearer Cain
[33:27] kill Abel it embarked upon a constant
[33:30] campaign to discredit the true seed they
[33:33] claimed that they and they alone were
[33:35] the true representatives of the Lord
[33:36] Jesus Christ and vaunted the fact that
[33:39] they were the original Church in Rome
[33:42] and they alone were the first church so
[33:46] here we are in the middle of the third
[33:49] age and we have two
[33:52] churches bearing the same name two
[33:56] churches claiming to be the Church of
[33:58] God the true church one is a hybrid that
[34:02] has drifted away from the word and taken
[34:04] in Pagan ritual and Pagan worship mixed
[34:07] with Christian ideas and she has all the
[34:10] signs of death following her the other
[34:13] is the true vine persecuted and hated
[34:16] but she stays true to the word brother
[34:21] brand says she follows the word and the
[34:23] signs follow her amen Hey listen if you
[34:27] stay true to the word if it's all about
[34:29] the word and you're faithful to the word
[34:31] the signs follow the word brother BR
[34:35] says the sick are healed the dead are
[34:37] raised she is alive with the life and
[34:39] the word of God she loves not her life
[34:42] but holds to his name and his faith even
[34:46] unto death let that be our testimony
[34:48] tonight we hold to his word we hold to
[34:51] his faith and the signs follow
[34:54] amen around this time there comes what
[34:58] seems to be a great reprieve we're we're
[35:00] in the in the in the fourth century and
[35:04] Constantine Rises to power and he grants
[35:08] religious freedom in the year
[35:12] 313 and although it ended the heavy
[35:14] persecution for a period of time it
[35:17] actually led to an even greater marriage
[35:20] between church and state which as I said
[35:22] are political Affairs and spiritual
[35:24] Affairs because Constantine felt that he
[35:27] could help the church by bringing all
[35:30] the people together both sides bringing
[35:33] them all together in this great big
[35:35] Fellowship to settle the growing divide
[35:38] amongst the Christians on many issues it
[35:41] was Constantine who called for the nine
[35:43] Council of
[35:45] 325 he thought he could bring all the
[35:47] groups together and they could iron out
[35:49] their differences and they could all be
[35:53] one now I know that sounds fine and
[35:56] dandy but it it'll never be so because
[35:58] the True Vine and false Vine can never
[36:00] be one it can never happen but the very
[36:05] name
[36:08] pergamus means thoroughly
[36:11] married and indeed State and church were
[36:14] married politics and religion were
[36:17] United The Offspring of that Union have
[36:20] been consistently the most horrible
[36:21] hybrids the world has ever seen the
[36:24] truth is not in them but all the evil
[36:27] ways of Cain the first hybrid
[36:32] is so the power of the emperor
[36:35] Constantine is now coming together with
[36:38] the influence and the power of that
[36:40] first church they're already powerful
[36:42] and Constantine feels like he can help
[36:45] and and this is the true marriage of
[36:47] church and state and so after nah what
[36:50] you find is things that were debated are
[36:54] now put down in iron and as Doctrine the
[36:58] trinitarian doctrine is now totally
[37:00] entrenched into Christianity and forced
[37:03] upon the people because now it has the
[37:05] power of the emperor behind it now it
[37:07] has the power of the government behind
[37:09] it now the only truth is the trinitarian
[37:13] doctrine you must accept the trinitarian
[37:15] doctrine it is infor is forced upon the
[37:18] people in their worship it's forced upon
[37:20] the people in their
[37:21] baptism prayer to Saints and to Mary are
[37:25] are now not only common practice
[37:27] but it's Doctrine and it's expected
[37:30] because the government is now behind it
[37:32] the emperor is now behind it and brother
[37:35] Bram says and right in this age now
[37:37] remember I mentioned earlier this is
[37:38] during the fall of the Roman
[37:40] Empire and right in this age is when the
[37:43] Beast of Revelation 13 and3 that was
[37:46] wounded to death and and we'll get to it
[37:49] in a minute I believe we'll have we'll
[37:51] read
[37:52] it the Beast that was wounded to death
[37:55] that was the Pagan Roman Empire comes
[37:57] back to life and power as the Holy Roman
[38:00] Empire Rome as a material Nation had
[38:03] suffered much depletion and soon would
[38:06] suffer it completely in other words that
[38:08] Empire was
[38:09] falling but it mattered not now for her
[38:12] religious Empire would keep her on top
[38:14] of the world governing from the inside
[38:17] where she would not appear to do so from
[38:19] the outside just so you have a a brief
[38:22] understanding the Roman Empire when we
[38:24] talk about the Roman Empire we're not
[38:26] talking about the pope and the church
[38:27] and the Bishops and the Cardinals we're
[38:29] not talking about that we're talking
[38:31] about the military power that ruled the
[38:34] the world that's known as Pagan Rome and
[38:36] at at the same time as it was collapsing
[38:39] that's the time that we see what they
[38:40] call the Holy Roman Empire rise into
[38:44] power now things like the Roman Catholic
[38:46] Church the Pope the priest and all that
[38:48] n so it spoke of in the Book of
[38:50] Revelation when there was a deadly wound
[38:53] given to the beast but then the wound is
[38:55] healed right Pagan Rome is killed but
[38:58] paple Holy Roman Empire raises up in its
[39:01] place and so that's kind of what we're
[39:03] speaking of right here the decline and
[39:05] fall of the Roman Empire Pagan Imperial
[39:09] Rome Civil Wars had weakened it Foreign
[39:12] Wars had weakened it social and
[39:13] financial crisises had weakened it
[39:16] corrupt and poor leadership had weakened
[39:18] it and it was
[39:21] collapsing and we see its collapse even
[39:23] here in Revelation 13 and I stood upon
[39:26] the land of the sea and saw a beast rise
[39:28] up out of the sea having seven heads and
[39:30] 10 horns and upon his 10
[39:33] horns 10 crowns and upon his heads the
[39:36] name of blasphemy and the Beast which I
[39:39] saw was like unto a leopard and his feet
[39:42] were as the feet of a bear and his mouth
[39:44] as the mouth of a Lon and the dragon
[39:47] gave him his power where's the power for
[39:50] this Empire come from the
[39:53] dragon and his seat and great Authority
[39:57] the Roman Empire it was great great
[39:59] Authority but look in the next verse and
[40:01] I saw one of his heads as it was wounded
[40:03] to
[40:04] death the fall of the Roman Empire and
[40:08] his deadly wound was healed and all the
[40:11] world wandered after the Beast now you
[40:13] have the church rising up in power
[40:15] whereas militarily it no longer is and
[40:18] they worshiped the dragon which gave
[40:21] power unto the Beast so so in this age
[40:24] as the Pagan Roman Empire start to
[40:26] crumble and the city of Rome itself
[40:29] Falls it's it's sacked by the vandals
[40:31] and and the the city itself Falls then
[40:34] papal or false Christian Rome Rises out
[40:37] of those ashes and it rises into power
[40:40] to the point that today Rome is known as
[40:43] the Eternal
[40:45] City think about that what blasphemy
[40:48] talking about it had names of blasphemy
[40:50] what blasphemy there's but one Eternal
[40:52] City and I can promise you Rome is not
[40:55] it Rome the Eternal City and it looked
[40:59] like Rome was
[41:01] finished but when Constantine joined
[41:04] church and state when he brought them
[41:07] together it gave Rome a new lease on
[41:09] life it gave them another opportunity to
[41:12] flourish and now paple Rome or false
[41:15] Christian Rome or what we would call as
[41:17] the Holy Roman Empire would rule by
[41:19] religion more than it had ever ruled by
[41:22] its military it would conquer more take
[41:25] more destroy more divide more than its
[41:28] military had ever
[41:31] done the power of the church brother
[41:34] Brown says the name Christian which
[41:36] originally brought persecution now think
[41:38] about
[41:39] this now became the name of the
[41:45] persecutors it was in this age that
[41:47] Augustine of Hippo set forth the precept
[41:50] that the church ought and must use Force
[41:54] if necessary to bring her children back
[41:57] into the fold and that it was in harmony
[42:00] with the word of God to kill the
[42:02] Heretics and
[42:04] apostates they literally taught that
[42:07] they were helping you by killing you it
[42:10] was the only way to bring you salvation
[42:13] it was the only way to bring you back
[42:14] into the fold so if you didn't see it
[42:17] the way they saw it and you wouldn't
[42:18] accept it then you know it's God's will
[42:21] that we kill you in order that you might
[42:23] possibly obtain some sort of Salvation
[42:25] in all this and so they began to teach
[42:28] this that it was actually in harmony
[42:30] with the word of God to kill the
[42:32] Heretics and who were Heretics anybody
[42:35] who didn't accept the Trinity Doctrine
[42:37] anybody who didn't lift up the Church of
[42:39] Rome as the great and all powerful and
[42:41] the and the mother of all anybody who
[42:44] didn't you know Elevate Satan to the
[42:46] place that he wanted to be elevated were
[42:49] Heretics in other words the True Vine
[42:52] was Heretics and during this time their
[42:54] thirst for blood was growing
[42:56] the false Vine attacked every way it
[42:58] could using the power of government and
[43:01] the law to persecute the True Vine and
[43:04] so what we'll find if you do any study
[43:06] on your own is that from this point on
[43:09] especially through the Dark Ages the
[43:11] false Vine will persecute and destroy
[43:14] the children of the True Vine and yet
[43:17] the whole time claiming the exact same
[43:19] father just like ishmail and
[43:22] Isaac claiming that they're the church
[43:25] brother Brown says the darkness of
[43:27] spiritual corruption will deepen and the
[43:29] True Light Of God will fade until
[43:32] number-wise it glows ever so faintly yet
[43:37] the promise of God will hold
[43:39] true the light shineth in darkness and
[43:43] the Darkness can do nothing about it
[43:47] aren't you glad tonight to hear that
[43:49] that in the midst of all this chaos and
[43:51] in the midst of the darkness I know it
[43:53] was dark then and it's a different type
[43:55] of persecution but it's never been
[43:57] darker than it than it is right now and
[43:59] he says the light shineth in darkness
[44:02] and the Darkness can do nothing about it
[44:05] listen the whole world has gone mad the
[44:08] whole world has gone into complete chaos
[44:10] the the whole world is Tainted with this
[44:12] false Babylonian religion the the people
[44:15] of the world have given their mind over
[44:17] to the Beast right now I'm speaking of
[44:20] right now's condition their mind has
[44:22] been given over to the Beast and yet in
[44:23] the midst of all that the light shineth
[44:27] in darkness it shall be light in the
[44:30] evening time listen that's the word of
[44:32] God you can count on it you just hold
[44:35] true Little Flock you just stand true no
[44:38] matter what others do no matter what
[44:40] others proclaim the light will shine in
[44:42] darkness and darkness can do nothing
[44:46] about it I'm thankful for that that it
[44:48] has no power over Sons and Daughters of
[44:51] the
[44:53] light the doctrine of the Nicko
[44:58] Revelations 2:15 says so hast thou also
[45:02] them that hold the doctrine of the
[45:04] nicians which thing I hate so if we find
[45:09] that he hates it I think we should hate
[45:11] it and if he hates it we should know
[45:13] exactly what it is and I know we've
[45:15] covered this a bit we covered it in the
[45:18] Ephesian age and then we talked about
[45:20] how nickan was a combination of two
[45:23] words two Greek words which meant to
[45:25] conquer coner the Ley okay to conquer
[45:29] the Ley so we're going to look at the
[45:31] doctrine of the nicians here for a
[45:34] minute he says it is
[45:38] terrible because God has never placed
[45:40] his church in the hands of an elected
[45:42] leadership which moves with political
[45:45] mindedness he has placed his church in
[45:48] the care of God ordained Spirit-filled
[45:51] word living men who lead people through
[45:55] feeding them them with the word amen
[45:59] listen nickan ISM wants to divide people
[46:03] it wants to separate people it wants to
[46:05] put people in different classes and you
[46:07] have to come under me because of the
[46:09] position that I hold God doesn't
[46:12] separate people into classes so that the
[46:14] masses are led by a few power hungry
[46:17] individuals that's not how God operates
[46:20] about power hungry and politically
[46:21] motivated who are considered holier than
[46:24] those that they lead that is not God's
[46:27] way it is not scripture that this priest
[46:30] is more holy than all the people that he
[46:32] feeds communion to that's not scriptural
[46:35] sure leadership should be holy but so
[46:38] should the whole congregation be holy
[46:41] sure leadership should live a holy life
[46:43] but so should the whole congregation
[46:45] live a holy life the the scripture
[46:47] doesn't teach that Ministry is to
[46:49] mediate between God and the people it
[46:53] doesn't teach that the ministry isn't SE
[46:55] separated in its worship from the people
[46:58] we're to worship together we're all to
[47:01] worship God together there is no levels
[47:04] to it brother Bram says God wants all to
[47:08] love and serve him together nican ISM
[47:12] destroys those precepts and instead
[47:15] separates the ministers from the
[47:18] people
[47:20] listen there are Ministries out there or
[47:26] let's let not put on ministers people in
[47:28] general who don't understand how it's
[47:29] supposed to
[47:30] work ministers are
[47:35] servants it is not to be put on a
[47:39] pedestal if you don't want to be a
[47:42] servent you don't want to be in
[47:45] ministry that's what it's about okay
[47:48] that's where it's supposed to be God
[47:50] wants all to love and serve him together
[47:53] nickon destroys these precepts and
[47:55] instead SE separates the ministers from
[47:56] the people and makes the leaders
[47:59] overlords instead of what's it say the
[48:02] ministers are instead of
[48:07] servants well I'm a
[48:09] minister I'm the minister so I get to do
[48:12] I'm a minister so I get I no you're a
[48:14] minister
[48:18] serve we get that out of
[48:21] balance we get we get that messed up in
[48:24] our head of how it's supposed to work
[48:26] they overlords instead of
[48:29] servants ministers are to be yes yes
[48:32] there's a respect for the office don't
[48:33] I'm not taking that away surely you got
[48:35] enough sense to see that but it's not
[48:36] some Overlord you must listen to me and
[48:38] I'm holier than you and this that's not
[48:40] how we're in this together we're
[48:43] fighting this battle together and you
[48:44] are every bit as important as I am and
[48:47] I'm as important as everybody and we're
[48:48] in this together and I can't make it
[48:50] without you and you can't make it
[48:51] without me and God doesn't divide us
[48:53] into classes of people for our work
[48:56] worship that's not how it is this isn't
[48:58] about one man and one group of men over
[49:00] lord and over another or one Ministry
[49:02] over lord and over other Ministries G
[49:05] listen that's chains that's
[49:08] denominations Jesus came to set us free
[49:11] from all that nonsense he came to set us
[49:14] free from that so you could be free not
[49:16] so man could rule over you not so a
[49:19] church could rule over you so you could
[49:21] serve him in Freedom so you could serve
[49:24] him and worship him and spirit and
[49:26] worship him in Truth Listen to what it
[49:28] says in 1 Peter 2:9 ye are a chosen
[49:32] generation a royal
[49:35] priesthood you are a holy nation A
[49:37] peculiar people that ye should show
[49:40] forth Praises of him who have called you
[49:42] out of Darkness into this Marvelous
[49:44] Light what's he say in Revelation 1:6
[49:47] and has made us Kings and
[49:51] priest we're all to enter into this
[49:54] together but what they did here is they
[49:56] began to set up offices of
[49:59] authority that weren't
[50:01] scriptural they set up Bishops who would
[50:04] have authority over the local leaders in
[50:06] each congregation so you may have a
[50:08] minister or an elder here that was over
[50:10] this church but then somewhere there was
[50:12] a bishop who was over all the Ministers
[50:15] of the 10 churches in this area and then
[50:17] somewhere there was an Archbishop that
[50:19] was over all the Bishops and then it was
[50:21] this hierarchy of power and political
[50:24] and political minded thinking Bishops
[50:27] decided who would rise up in the
[50:29] ministry who would be in power in this
[50:31] area and the whole hierarchy was set up
[50:34] for what purpose to control the
[50:37] people listen we are to be controlled by
[50:41] the Holy
[50:43] Spirit you are to be controlled and be
[50:45] submissive and yes you you are to come
[50:48] under a pastor there there's no doubt
[50:50] we're not trying to get those things
[50:51] confused but we're talking about it's
[50:53] not a hierarchy of authority placed by
[50:56] man God calls his men into position God
[51:00] puts leadership into men's life we're
[51:02] not placing men into those
[51:04] positions so instead of God called holy
[51:08] spirit-led leadership in each local
[51:10] assembly you had a headquarters
[51:13] somewhere and you were told exactly how
[51:15] and when things should be done brother
[51:18] Brown says men began to VI for the off
[51:20] office of Bishop with the result that
[51:23] this position was being given to the
[51:24] more educ ated and the more materially
[51:27] Progressive and politically minded men
[51:30] so what happens when it comes that way
[51:33] then no longer is the qualification for
[51:36] a bishop or Minister uh a dedicated God
[51:40] Called Life but it's who's the most
[51:41] educated who can operate in this
[51:43] ceremony the best who who who knows the
[51:45] rituals and and who's connected most in
[51:47] politics and so
[51:49] suddenly you ended up with a cage of
[51:52] every unclean and hateful bird every
[51:55] spirit and operating in high places
[51:58] brother Brown says with man-made
[51:59] doctrines of the elevation of Bishops to
[52:02] a place not according to them in
[52:03] scripture The Next Step was the handing
[52:06] out of graded titles that built into a
[52:09] religious hierarchy for soon there were
[52:11] archbishops over Bishops and Cardinals
[52:14] over the archbishops and by the time of
[52:16] the bonfice III there was a pope over
[52:18] all or a pontiff that we already talked
[52:22] about the pontiff or the priesthood of
[52:24] Babylon
[52:27] and just so you'd have an understanding
[52:28] of what this looks like here's how it's
[52:30] set
[52:32] up so if you were a Catholic
[52:36] tonight you'd be at the very bottom of
[52:39] all
[52:40] this and that's where you're at in their
[52:42] world and over you is priest and then
[52:45] over priest are Bishops and then over
[52:48] the Bishops are archbishops and then
[52:50] over the archbishops are Cardinals and
[52:52] over all of them is the Pope and it's
[52:56] trickle down effect and you have no say
[52:59] in anything you can't even talk to God
[53:00] for
[53:01] yourself it takes a priest to mediate
[53:04] for you and and you have to tell him all
[53:06] your problems and all your you have no
[53:09] direct relationship with God at all they
[53:10] took it all from the people and they set
[53:14] up this
[53:15] hierarchy brother Bram says thus that
[53:17] which started as a deed in the first age
[53:20] notice it was a
[53:22] deed was made a literal Doctrine and and
[53:25] so it is today Bishops still claim power
[53:27] to control men and deal with them as
[53:30] they desire placing them wherever they
[53:32] so will in the ministry this denies the
[53:35] leadership of the Holy Ghost who said
[53:38] separate me Paul and Barnabas for the
[53:41] work where unto I have called them this
[53:45] is anti- word and
[53:48] anti-christ listen I just I went to
[53:51] Matthew 23 and8 because you know in this
[53:54] it's the the the you got the Bishops and
[53:57] the archbishops and they call them
[53:58] Father this and father
[54:00] that but Matthew 23 and8 Jesus says but
[54:03] be not ye called Rabbi for one is your
[54:07] master even Christ and all ye are
[54:10] Brethren and call no man your father
[54:13] upon the Earth for one is your father
[54:16] which is in heaven neither be ye called
[54:19] Masters for one is your master even
[54:22] Christ but he that is greatest of among
[54:25] you shall be your
[54:29] servant how was it that Pagan Rome the
[54:33] Roman Empire came to
[54:35] power divide
[54:37] and conquer how is it that the Christian
[54:42] Empire or paple Rome did it they divided
[54:46] nickan ISM divide and conquer levels
[54:51] divide the people separate the people
[54:54] into different levels
[54:55] and then conquer the leoty that's
[54:58] exactly the same spirit and tactic they
[55:00] use to conquer the world militarily is
[55:02] the exact same thing they Ed in the
[55:04] religious world to conquer the world
[55:07] divide and conquer they excommunicated
[55:11] all the righteous leaders they burned
[55:14] the
[55:15] Scrolls they said it took special
[55:17] education to understand the word they
[55:20] took the word out of the hands of the
[55:22] common people so now your only sword
[55:25] would be what the priest tells
[55:27] you you had no way to know and then the
[55:31] word was only written in Latin so the
[55:33] common people a lot of times couldn't
[55:34] even read it they had no idea what it
[55:37] said you weren't even allowed to have it
[55:39] you had to trust what the priest told
[55:43] you he says having taken away the word
[55:45] from the people it soon came to the
[55:48] people it soon came to the people
[55:50] listening only to what the priest had to
[55:52] say and doing what he told them them
[55:55] they called that God and His holy word
[55:58] they took over the minds and lives of
[56:00] the people and made them the Servants of
[56:03] a despotic priesthood and so today we
[56:06] find that the Roman Catholic Church
[56:08] calls herself the mother church and no
[56:11] doubt she is she is the mother Church
[56:15] she was the original church that that
[56:17] backslid away from the gospel she was
[56:20] the first church of Rome and in her was
[56:22] found the deeds and the doctrines of the
[56:24] nickan
[56:25] as a mother she has produced daughters
[56:28] all the churches that have come out of
[56:31] her and then turned and went right back
[56:34] under her spirit of organization or her
[56:37] daughters theyve went right back to the
[56:39] spirit of organization Nicol latinism
[56:41] and God says I hate it he hates that
[56:47] Spirit he hates that spirit that would
[56:49] come in and control when he says come
[56:51] out of her my people he says come out of
[56:54] her my people people that you be not
[56:55] partakers of her sins and that you be
[56:58] not partakers and receive of her plagues
[57:01] and listen I want to charge you no
[57:03] matter how long time
[57:05] terries no matter how long we stay here
[57:08] upon the Earth no matter how long this
[57:10] goes on because we don't know how long
[57:11] it will be no matter who comes or goes
[57:15] no matter what Doctrine dries up you
[57:17] remember this you are free you are a
[57:20] free people and you are to remain a free
[57:22] people you're not to come underneath
[57:23] some headship come underneath some
[57:25] headquarters you are to be led by the
[57:27] Holy Ghost led by Holy Ghost filled
[57:29] ministry that's what you are to be led
[57:32] by Stand Fast in that Liberty don't ever
[57:34] go back into that don't ever go back
[57:37] into something that would bind down your
[57:38] worship clamp down on how you're
[57:40] supposed to serve God but you fight for
[57:43] whatever you have to fight and and
[57:44] however you have to fight in order to
[57:46] stay free no matter how long time
[57:48] terries because that Spirit of
[57:50] denominationalism that Spirit of nianis
[57:53] will come around and try to reclaim
[57:57] people but you got to say no I ain't I
[57:59] ain't standing for that I ain't falling
[58:01] for that but I'm going to remain free
[58:02] Amen brother Brown says no wonder people
[58:05] are mixed up today if they were so mixed
[58:08] up then so close to
[58:11] Pentecost now they are in a most
[58:13] desperate condition about 2,000 years
[58:17] away from the original truth oh Church
[58:20] of God there is only one hope get back
[58:24] to the word
[58:25] and stay with it get back to the word
[58:28] I'm I've said this before I'm going to
[58:29] say it again and I don't mean this
[58:31] negative towards Ministry I'd be
[58:32] throwing shade at myself if if that was
[58:34] the case but if the ministry can stand
[58:36] up here and preach false Doctrine to you
[58:38] service after service after service
[58:40] after service and you don't catch it
[58:42] that's your
[58:43] fault there is a feeding that you are
[58:46] supposed to do there you are supposed to
[58:48] be in the word you were supposed to be
[58:50] feeding you were supposed to be digging
[58:53] it shouldn't come as a surprise that oh
[58:55] wait we've been hearing false stuff all
[58:57] this time you should recognize it right
[58:59] off the bat something don't sound right
[59:01] that trumpet don't give a certain sound
[59:03] something's wrong with that you ought to
[59:05] be in the word enough to recognize when
[59:08] something isn't
[59:10] right get back to the word he says and
[59:14] stick and stay with
[59:17] it another doctrine that he says he
[59:20] hates is the doctrine of balum and I'm
[59:23] sorry that on the right for some reason
[59:25] doesn't show up I'll read it to
[59:28] you Revelation 2:14 he says but I have a
[59:31] few things against thee because thou
[59:33] Hast there them that hold the doctrine
[59:35] of balum who taught baac to cast a
[59:38] stumbling block before the children of
[59:40] Israel to eat things sacrificed un idols
[59:42] and to commit
[59:44] fornication and the quote here says you
[59:47] see now listen close we're going to get
[59:50] into a few things right here as we we're
[59:52] on the downhill side of this
[59:55] listen close brother Brown says now you
[59:57] see if you take away the word of God and
[1:00:01] the moving of the spirit as a means of
[1:00:05] worship then you will have to give the
[1:00:08] people another form of worship as
[1:00:10] substitute and substitution spells
[1:00:23] bmismart another form of worship as a
[1:00:26] substitute and substitution spells
[1:00:31] baalism right here brother brandham ties
[1:00:33] it together and right here is why we
[1:00:36] fight so hard against
[1:00:38] this I know over and over brother Tim
[1:00:41] brother Joe brother Timothy and myself
[1:00:43] we cry out against this spirit that
[1:00:45] would want to come in and clamp down on
[1:00:47] the moving of the spirit or what we
[1:00:50] might would call freedom of worship the
[1:00:52] ability to worship Him in spirit and
[1:00:54] Truth as the spirit moves upon your life
[1:00:57] because it's not we're not here for
[1:00:58] nickan ISM where I tell you how the
[1:01:01] spirit should move on each one of you
[1:01:03] it's not going to move the same on you
[1:01:04] as it does on me or shall I say it like
[1:01:06] this you're not going to respond exactly
[1:01:08] the way I do we're all nature different
[1:01:10] but there must be a
[1:01:12] response and we're not going to sit here
[1:01:14] and allow this thing to be clamped down
[1:01:16] upon us to where we accept bism as our
[1:01:20] form of worship now what's interesting
[1:01:21] is brother Bram now goes and makes it
[1:01:23] very clear what B ism
[1:01:25] is taking away the moving of the spirit
[1:01:28] and nickan ISM and all that's left is a
[1:01:32] substitute he ties this together and
[1:01:35] that substitute is the doctrine of balum
[1:01:39] we're going to get into it brother man
[1:01:41] says now we know that Israel was the
[1:01:42] chosen people of God they were the
[1:01:45] Pentecostals of their day they had taken
[1:01:49] Refuge under the blood and they had been
[1:01:51] baptized in the Red Sea and they came up
[1:01:54] out out of the waters singing in the
[1:01:56] spirit and dancing under the energy of
[1:01:59] the Holy
[1:02:01] Ghost now this sounds like a good
[1:02:03] meeting to me now some people would have
[1:02:05] sat back and criticized and called it
[1:02:06] fanaticism and emotionalism to it sounds
[1:02:09] like a good meeting to me and they come
[1:02:12] out of that and they're journeying to
[1:02:13] the promised land and they come to a
[1:02:15] place called
[1:02:17] Moab and Moab had had was the son of lot
[1:02:21] by one of his own daughters and lot was
[1:02:24] Abra 's nephew so Israel and Moab are
[1:02:29] related they're related and Israel asked
[1:02:32] permission to pass through the land as
[1:02:34] they journeyed to their promised land
[1:02:37] and they say look we're family we mean
[1:02:40] you know harm we just want to pass
[1:02:41] through if we take anything if we eat
[1:02:44] anything if we drink anything we'll pay
[1:02:45] for it no problem just just let us pass
[1:02:47] through we're we're not here to hinder
[1:02:49] you we're not here to bother you we're
[1:02:51] just on the way to a promised land is
[1:02:53] that how you feel tonight look I'm not
[1:02:54] here to tell everybody else how to do
[1:02:55] what they need to do I'm just going to
[1:02:57] go to the promised land and I'm going to
[1:02:58] worship God in Freedom while I do it and
[1:03:01] they're just saying we're just going to
[1:03:02] the promised land we mean no harm but
[1:03:04] notice I want you to notice why baac was
[1:03:08] so against them and their March to the
[1:03:11] promised land listen what the prophet of
[1:03:13] God says but King baac got very excited
[1:03:18] that head of that nickan Bunch was not
[1:03:20] about to let the church come through
[1:03:22] with its signs and wonders and diverse
[1:03:24] manifestations of the Holy Ghost with
[1:03:27] their faces shining with the glory of
[1:03:29] God it was too risky as he might lose
[1:03:32] some of his
[1:03:34] crowd my baac didn't want his people to
[1:03:38] see
[1:03:40] Victory baac didn't want his people to
[1:03:43] see what real Freedom looked like in the
[1:03:45] house of
[1:03:46] God baac didn't want it seeing what it
[1:03:48] looked like when people had been
[1:03:50] completely set free and and since they
[1:03:52] didn't have it there at their place in
[1:03:53] Moab he had to be against it and he had
[1:03:56] to teach against it and how it was all
[1:03:58] wrong and it was all emotion and it was
[1:04:00] all workup in case some of his people
[1:04:03] might join the march to the promised
[1:04:05] land well listen I say come join us on
[1:04:07] our March to the promised land don't be
[1:04:10] bound down in that balum religion be
[1:04:13] free you're supposed to be free today
[1:04:16] not bound
[1:04:18] up he was so afraid of it that he wanted
[1:04:21] to curse
[1:04:22] it so afraid of it that he hires a a
[1:04:25] hireling prophet named
[1:04:27] balum and we know the
[1:04:29] story how that God turned balum
[1:04:32] down but because of the rewards and the
[1:04:35] favors of man now notice take balum and
[1:04:39] place him over here in the
[1:04:40] age where people are becoming powerful
[1:04:43] as Bishops and Cardinals because of
[1:04:46] reward and power and what is it that
[1:04:49] sways
[1:04:50] balum more money more power well I know
[1:04:54] God said no but I'll give you I'll give
[1:04:56] you more position I'll give you more
[1:04:59] power ask God
[1:05:00] again and so because of this because of
[1:05:03] the rewards offer him balum kept right
[1:05:05] on asking listen young people once God
[1:05:08] has spoken that is his
[1:05:12] answer and if you continue begging you
[1:05:15] aren't looking for his will you're
[1:05:18] looking for his
[1:05:19] permission and that's totally
[1:05:22] different once he speaks take that
[1:05:26] answer don't keep begging because he may
[1:05:30] give in and that's a dangerous place to
[1:05:33] be so balum went back to God brother
[1:05:36] Brown says now one answer from God
[1:05:38] should have been
[1:05:40] enough but not for
[1:05:42] self-willed balum young people we can't
[1:05:46] be
[1:05:47] self-willed self-will gets you in
[1:05:49] trouble every time we got to look for
[1:05:51] God's will I don't want to be
[1:05:53] self-willed Lord take my will out of me
[1:05:55] not my will Lord but thy will be done
[1:05:58] brother Bram says
[1:06:00] self-willed
[1:06:02] balum he says he should have realized
[1:06:05] that this was simply God's permissive
[1:06:07] will and he wouldn't be able to curse
[1:06:10] them if he went 20 times and tried 20
[1:06:13] times how like balam are people today
[1:06:17] they believe in three gods they get
[1:06:19] baptized in three titles instead of the
[1:06:21] name and yet God will send the spirit
[1:06:23] upon them as he did upon balum and they
[1:06:26] will go on believing that they are
[1:06:28] exactly right and here they are actually
[1:06:31] perfect
[1:06:33] bites well God blessed me so I must be
[1:06:36] doing right God God poured his Spirit
[1:06:39] out on me so I must be doing right no
[1:06:42] you're operating in his permission
[1:06:44] you're not operating in his will and
[1:06:47] that's the route that balum took and
[1:06:48] it's a false
[1:06:50] teaching I want to look at this close
[1:06:52] now listen
[1:06:55] in this time and this constantly comes
[1:06:57] up I understand that but if you read
[1:06:58] this portion of the church age book you
[1:07:00] came across it yourself in this time
[1:07:03] where people are constantly questioning
[1:07:04] emotion and questioning the Supernatural
[1:07:07] and questioning the Holy Ghost I want
[1:07:09] you to watch this next part real
[1:07:12] close he killed a ram signifying the
[1:07:15] coming of the Messiah and Bam knew what
[1:07:18] to do he knew what to do to approach
[1:07:21] unto God he had the mechanics just
[1:07:26] right let me break that down when we say
[1:07:29] that he understood the doctrines he
[1:07:33] understood the teachings he understood
[1:07:35] the godhead he had water baptism just
[1:07:37] right he went to church on Sunday and
[1:07:38] Wednesdays he knew everything by the
[1:07:42] letter just right I'm G say it again he
[1:07:46] had the mechanics just right but not the
[1:07:50] Dynamics same as now can't you see it
[1:07:53] Nick
[1:07:55] nans church that can't be no
[1:07:58] planer same as now can't you see it Nick
[1:08:03] itans and there was Israel down there in
[1:08:05] the valley offering the same sacrifice
[1:08:08] doing the same things now they're doing
[1:08:10] exactly what balam's
[1:08:12] doing but only one had signs following
[1:08:15] only one had God in their midst form
[1:08:19] won't get you anywhere it can't take the
[1:08:22] place of Spirit
[1:08:25] manifestation that is what happened at
[1:08:27] NAIA they put over balam's Doctrine not
[1:08:31] the doctrine of God and they stumbled y
[1:08:34] they fell and they became dead men even
[1:08:37] in like Tabernacle let us never become
[1:08:40] dead men where we get lifted up and
[1:08:41] prideful and what we know and the
[1:08:43] mysteries of this and we know this and
[1:08:45] we know that but let it be because we
[1:08:47] have God in our midst if you want to get
[1:08:50] anywhere it's because you got the spirit
[1:08:51] of God in your midst and God's moving
[1:08:53] and God's changing and God's healing and
[1:08:55] God's saving and it's God moving in this
[1:08:58] place and let's not get to a place of
[1:09:00] form and tradition and lifted up in the
[1:09:03] mechanics of it
[1:09:06] all he knew the mechanics he knew the
[1:09:09] rules he knew the letter of the law he
[1:09:10] knew the quotes but he was lacking the
[1:09:13] Dynamics and brother Bram says
[1:09:19] nicians he says only one had God and it
[1:09:21] was the one with signs following not the
[1:09:24] one with perfect form not the one with
[1:09:27] perfect Church
[1:09:29] order the one with signs
[1:09:34] following and so he can't curse them and
[1:09:36] baac wants to take balum down and show
[1:09:38] them their back Parts what's this mean
[1:09:41] it means he wants to show them their
[1:09:42] faults and their failures their issues
[1:09:44] and their struggles their carnal side
[1:09:47] hello we have a carnal
[1:09:50] side come on let's take our Halos off I
[1:09:53] didn't even have one but if you do we
[1:09:55] have a carnal side we all have faults
[1:09:58] and failures and if you study your
[1:10:01] brother and sister's faults and failures
[1:10:02] long enough that'll be all you
[1:10:06] see come on look I still need all the
[1:10:09] grace and I need to extend
[1:10:12] Grace but bayac says let's take them
[1:10:14] around and see their faults and failures
[1:10:15] and their carnal side surely there's
[1:10:17] enough faults that we can curse them now
[1:10:20] notice the attitude look don't
[1:10:23] dechristianize people when you see their
[1:10:24] faults and failures you see where that
[1:10:26] Spirit comes from now I'm not talking
[1:10:29] about somebody living in sin you know
[1:10:30] what I'm talking about here a struggle
[1:10:31] or a fault or a St let's quit de
[1:10:33] christianizing
[1:10:35] people surely these aren't God's people
[1:10:38] surely that ain't the spirit of God
[1:10:40] moving down at evening light Tabernacle
[1:10:42] look at all the flaws in that
[1:10:46] church I love this he says yes Israel
[1:10:50] had her back Parts carnal Parts they had
[1:10:53] their side that wasn't
[1:10:57] praiseworthy but in spite of their
[1:11:00] imperfections by the purpose of God that
[1:11:02] works through election Hallelujah he
[1:11:05] says by grace and not by works they had
[1:11:08] the cloud by day and the pillar of Fire
[1:11:10] by night they had the smitten Rock the
[1:11:12] Brazen Serpent and the signs and wonders
[1:11:15] they were Vindicated not in themselves
[1:11:18] but in God May our Vindication not be in
[1:11:23] ourselves tonight but may it be in God
[1:11:25] and His presence amongst us are there
[1:11:27] faults and failures absolutely but God's
[1:11:29] with us have you stumbled and messed up
[1:11:31] absolutely but God is amongst us God is
[1:11:34] working in our midst what Vindication do
[1:11:36] you have God is moving in our midst
[1:11:40] that's the Vindication they
[1:11:43] have and so balum formulates a
[1:11:46] plan to cause Israel to fall like Eve in
[1:11:49] the
[1:11:50] garden by flesh
[1:11:52] desire
[1:11:54] balam knew that if Israel fell in sin
[1:11:56] that God would have to deal with
[1:11:59] them in death like he had in the
[1:12:02] garden so he sends out an invitation now
[1:12:04] remember we're studying an
[1:12:07] age we're going to just bring this right
[1:12:10] back to our third age but balam sends
[1:12:14] them an invitation to a great feast a
[1:12:17] fellowship as it
[1:12:18] were and they accept and and during this
[1:12:21] Feast there's dancing and music and
[1:12:23] carousing and things of that nature and
[1:12:26] the men of Israel fall into lust and
[1:12:28] fall into adultery which was balam's
[1:12:30] plan all
[1:12:31] along falls into this with the women of
[1:12:34] Moab and God slow slew
[1:12:37] 42,000 of
[1:12:39] them and this is exactly what happened
[1:12:42] at
[1:12:44] Nia because the true church had
[1:12:47] Vindication the true church had God
[1:12:49] working in their midst the true church
[1:12:52] had signs and wonders even though there
[1:12:53] were few and the false Vine invited them
[1:12:56] to a
[1:12:57] fellowship at the Nan Council where they
[1:13:00] fell into reasoning and they fell into
[1:13:02] balam's
[1:13:05] Doctrine and he says and that is what
[1:13:07] Constantine and the successors did at
[1:13:09] nah and after nah they invited the
[1:13:13] people of God to the convention and when
[1:13:15] the church sat down to eat and Rose up
[1:13:17] to play partaking of church forms
[1:13:20] ceremonies Pagan feasts named after
[1:13:22] Christian rights she was trapped she had
[1:13:25] committed
[1:13:26] fornication and God walked
[1:13:31] out May we never get to a place where
[1:13:34] God gets up and walks
[1:13:37] out let's not settle for form and
[1:13:40] tradition let's not settle for something
[1:13:43] that's a little more sensible a little
[1:13:45] more tame let's not settle for cold and
[1:13:48] formal but let's be identified by the
[1:13:51] moving of the spirit identified by God
[1:13:55] in our midst identified by him working
[1:13:58] by signs and wonders and worship and
[1:14:00] spirit and in
[1:14:02] truth at the naasan council Council
[1:14:05] Pagan Feast with new Christian names
[1:14:08] were added Apostles Creed was given to
[1:14:10] the people ancestor worship was taught
[1:14:13] to the people confessing their sins to
[1:14:15] men was taught to the
[1:14:17] people they were partakers with the
[1:14:19] devil and not of the Lord they were in
[1:14:22] idolatry whether they admitted it or not
[1:14:27] brother brand says they can say what
[1:14:28] they want now he's talking about today's
[1:14:31] churches but they are partaking in the
[1:14:34] well-known Babylonian satanic religion
[1:14:38] and have joined themselves to idols and
[1:14:40] committed spiritual fornication which
[1:14:42] means death they are dead so the church
[1:14:47] and state were married the church joined
[1:14:49] up with Idols with the power of the
[1:14:51] state behind them they felt that now the
[1:14:54] kingdom had come and God's will had been
[1:14:57] enforced upon the Earth so this is where
[1:15:01] it begins to go down that path of
[1:15:03] complete idolatry and complete
[1:15:05] fornication we just have a little a
[1:15:08] little couple of slides here left as we
[1:15:10] wrap this
[1:15:11] up the
[1:15:13] warning Revelation 2:16
[1:15:16] repent or else I will come unto thee
[1:15:19] quickly and will fight against them with
[1:15:21] the sword of my mouth brother says what
[1:15:23] else can he say can God overlook the sin
[1:15:26] of those who have borne his name in vain
[1:15:29] there is only one way to receive Grace
[1:15:31] in The Hour of sin repent confess you
[1:15:35] were wrong come to God for forgiveness
[1:15:37] and for the spirit of God but still the
[1:15:40] grace of God Cries Out repent oh how
[1:15:42] sweet are the thoughts of
[1:15:44] repentance nothing in my hands I bring
[1:15:47] simply to thy cross I cling I bring my
[1:15:50] sorrow I Repent that I am what I am and
[1:15:53] what I have done now it is the blood
[1:15:55] nothing but the blood of Jesus what will
[1:15:57] it be repentance or the sword of death
[1:16:01] it's up to you what
[1:16:04] Grace think about this for a minute all
[1:16:07] that's going on in this age all the
[1:16:10] falling away all the falsehoods all the
[1:16:12] killing all the turning and adding and
[1:16:14] and and the blasphemy that's going on
[1:16:17] and yet God is crying out
[1:16:21] repent he's still pleading he's still
[1:16:24] calling he's still given an opportunity
[1:16:26] of Grace repent or
[1:16:29] else he's given opportunity and listen
[1:16:32] I'll tell you right now young person
[1:16:34] even tonight he's still calling and giv
[1:16:36] opportunity he's still pleading with
[1:16:38] those that are struggling he's still
[1:16:40] offering you Grace tonight I love how
[1:16:42] brother Bram says right here the last
[1:16:44] four words it's up to
[1:16:48] you you've been failing you've been
[1:16:51] falling you've been mixed up in the and
[1:16:53] the idols of the world you've been
[1:16:55] getting lukewarm relying on being a
[1:16:57] church member you've been growing cold
[1:16:59] it's up to
[1:17:01] you you have an opportunity even through
[1:17:03] the scripture tonight
[1:17:06] repent you still have opportunity oh
[1:17:10] brother Aaron this is a church a study
[1:17:11] that ain't even how this service is
[1:17:12] going what I'm telling you is is it's
[1:17:15] not too late wherever you're at it's
[1:17:18] repent
[1:17:20] or yeah else
[1:17:23] you haven't crossed the line I don't
[1:17:25] care what the devil's telling you I
[1:17:26] don't care what situation you find
[1:17:27] yourself in what sins how many times
[1:17:29] you've fallen down he's calling out for
[1:17:30] you tonight
[1:17:32] repent There's an opportunity for you to
[1:17:34] repent to light that fire once again and
[1:17:37] and and and and grow strong again
[1:17:39] because there will be not just a warning
[1:17:42] but there is a
[1:17:45] reward he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:17:48] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[1:17:50] to him that overcometh will I give to to
[1:17:53] eat of the Hidden mana and will give him
[1:17:55] a white stone and in the stone a new
[1:17:57] name written which no man knoweth saveth
[1:18:00] he that receiveth it brother brandom
[1:18:02] goes into this just a little bit he
[1:18:04] talks about that hidden mana and he
[1:18:06] talks about the Mana that had been put
[1:18:08] inside the ark and how it would never
[1:18:09] spoil and how down Through the Ages they
[1:18:11] could come get a taste of it and then he
[1:18:13] kind of starts talking about how in each
[1:18:15] age by revelation God gave back a little
[1:18:18] bit more of the original mana and he and
[1:18:21] he would break it off and give it to the
[1:18:23] messenger but it wasn't just for
[1:18:24] themselves but to the Overcomers they
[1:18:27] got to eat of that Mana as the messenger
[1:18:28] would pass it out to the people of that
[1:18:30] age he he gave back things that had been
[1:18:33] hidden and he allowed the Saints to
[1:18:35] taste of the pure unadulterated word and
[1:18:38] then in our day it was all opened up all
[1:18:42] the Mysteries were revealed and you have
[1:18:43] the opportunity now as an overcomer to
[1:18:46] partake of all the hidden Mana you can
[1:18:49] eat from that that which has been hidden
[1:18:51] down Through the Ages like like I said
[1:18:53] Jesus would give it to the messengers of
[1:18:55] the age and they in turn would give it
[1:18:56] to the people and then he says and we'll
[1:18:59] give him a white stone and in the stone
[1:19:03] a new name written which no man knoweth
[1:19:06] and the way brother Bron broke this down
[1:19:08] just it excited my heart as I read it
[1:19:11] and he talked about how Rome when they
[1:19:12] got the power of the treasury they had
[1:19:14] tapped into all the resources and all
[1:19:16] the money and they built these giant uh
[1:19:19] Cathedrals and these giant temples and
[1:19:21] they would all be made out out of white
[1:19:24] stone all out of marble they took all
[1:19:27] the money from the from the poor and he
[1:19:29] said the the true seed maybe they didn't
[1:19:31] have that marble maybe they didn't have
[1:19:33] statues built out after them he said God
[1:19:36] wasn't in the marble and God wasn't in
[1:19:38] the temples God was with his true seed
[1:19:40] maybe hiding in a cave he was with that
[1:19:43] true seed maybe in a little home meeting
[1:19:45] he was with that true seed maybe in the
[1:19:46] Coliseum facing death that's where God
[1:19:49] was but he says those that have laid
[1:19:51] their Treasures up in heaven you may not
[1:19:53] get a statue of white stone here he said
[1:19:56] but don't worry you'll have something
[1:19:57] like that there your Treasures will be
[1:19:59] there he said it'll be white stone
[1:20:02] you'll have Treasures in Heaven and you
[1:20:04] will have a new name written in a white
[1:20:06] stone he says new
[1:20:08] names he says it could well be that name
[1:20:12] was our true and original name written
[1:20:15] in the Lamb's Book of Life from the
[1:20:16] foundation of the world he knows that
[1:20:19] name but we do not think of about it you
[1:20:23] may not ever get nothing here as far as
[1:20:25] money and big white marble he says but
[1:20:27] there you'll be memorialized eternally
[1:20:30] and you'll be given a new name listen we
[1:20:32] know all about new names we know how
[1:20:34] Abraham and Sarah had to have a name
[1:20:36] change we know all all about those
[1:20:38] things how how Jacob had to have a name
[1:20:40] change he says you're going to get a
[1:20:42] name change and he says it just might be
[1:20:45] that original name that was written on
[1:20:48] the Lamb's Book of Life that he knows
