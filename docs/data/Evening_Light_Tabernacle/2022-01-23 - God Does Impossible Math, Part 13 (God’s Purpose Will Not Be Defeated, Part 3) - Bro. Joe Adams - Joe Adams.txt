he knew what i needed to keep me from taking my life i turned in the old life and now i'm living a life for christ he said may the lord you you today like he dear that day in a deer stand impossible man god's still reaching hearts god's still moving god's still calling god's still healing god's still delivering god is still god so no matter what you're facing no matter what you're going through in life he's still god he's the constant in a believer's life and i believe that with all my heart this morning i believe that god has something special for us and i want to just want to take just for a little while this morning to speak to you again on god does impossible math and i want to take it as a topic god's purpose will not be defeated part three god has a purpose for everything that we face in life sometimes you can't see the future because you're always looking back at what you've just faced what you've been through but god has a purpose and god has a plan let's just go to him in prayer father we thank you lord this morning lord we have sung the songs of zion we feel your presence it's already here lord this morning and lord we make you welcome we're not pushing you off into a corner but father we're here to wash your feet lord whether on the mountaintop whether we're in the valley lord we're here to worship you no matter what the case no matter what the situation no matter what we're facing god we're here to worship this morning and i just pray father you would receive our worship and lord you had opened the windows of heaven this morning and it's rained down a blessing upon us we as your children lord we just need you this morning and we pray you'll anoint the lips of the speaker father they'll speak only the words of life and you'll anoint the ears of the hero lord they would only hear what the spirit wants to be heard this morning so lord we just ask these things this morning for your honor for your glory just in jesus name amen if you have your bibles this morning we're going to look here in first kings 18. first kings 18 and verse 36. hey man it's good to be back in the house of the lord with you we're not able to be here wednesday night we were not feeling well at home but we did stream in and you know brother timothy poured his heart out the healer hasn't lost his touch and i believe he's still going by still the healing angel still visits your address he knows exactly where you live he knows exactly what you're going through and he knows exactly when to heal i was listening to a sermon yesterday i believe it was in testimony in 1959 just a short little cap of a message brother man i'm talking about the the little black girl there who was blind i believe it was in in arkansas and he's she told her she said you show me where that healer is i'll find my own daddy well she didn't realize she was right in the place of the healer he was right there and she said he grabbed a hold of her or his lapel and wouldn't let him go that's the way we need to be this morning with god grab ahold and don't let them go but we find here in the scripture that came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening service that elijah the prophet came near and he said and said lord god of abraham isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art god in israel and that i am thy servant and i have done all these things at that word hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the lord god and that thou hast turn their heart back again then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and he licked up the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the lord he is god the lord is god and elijah said unto them take the prophet to baal let not none of them escape and they took them and elijah brought them down to the book of kishan and he slew them there go to chapter 19 and verse 1. and they have told jezebel all that elijah had done and with all how he had slain all the prophets with the sword and jezebel sent a messenger unto elijah saying let the gods excuse me real quick let me get this fixed god's due to me and more also if i make not thy life as the life of one of those them by tomorrow about this time and when he saw that he arose and he went for his life and he came to bresheba which belongs to judah and he left his servant there but he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die and he said is it enough now oh lord take my life for i am not better than my father's and as he lay and he slept under the juniper tree of the juniper tree behold there an angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat and he looked and behold there was a cake bacon of coals and a cruise of water at his head and he did eat and drank and he laid him down again and the angel of the lord came again the second time and touched him and said arise and eat because a journey is too great for thee and he arose and he did eat and he went in the strength of the meat forty days and forty nights unto horeb the mount of god you can have your seats this morning so we find here the story of elijah and no doubt we look in first kings 17 first kings 18 and we find some pretty miraculous episodes or situations that took place and you know we find when we started our reading elijah was on mount carmel if you could cut me down just a little bit i'm extremely hot up here uh he was on a mount carmel but yet he finds himself on a juniper tree he finds himself wandering through a desert he finds himself in a cave and like elijah many of us our lives have the same situation it goes through the same cycles we have mountain top experiences we have juniper tree experiences we have desert wandering experiences we find ourselves thankfully in a cave where the voice of the lord can speak to us brother brethren would tell us and what does thou hear he said now pastors here know other ministers watch after your mount carmel's you're going to have a juniper tree after your mount carmels you're going to have a juniper tree whenever a man has a blessing and the power god pours down and does something for you look out satan's on the track just remember the next day the monday after a good day of sunday it's gonna be a hard thing because he's gonna do everything he can to knock that confidence out of you that the holy spirit instilled in you the day before i might have a little bit voice struggles because i've been sick this week so we're gonna find that happy medium here in just a minute but see that's not it amen we're going to get there we got new mics we're good but we find satan's going to do everything he can to knock the confidence that god has instilled in you the day before but i want you to know god still has confidence in you and even when you don't have confidence in yourself god has confidence in you god has confidence in what he's placed in you he has confidence in what he's deposited in you he has comment because this is not the work of a man but this is the work of god and there's not enough demons there are not enough struggles there are not enough trials that can defeat you that can defeat the plan of god that can defeat the purpose of god god has confidence in his seed job faced some hardships lost his family lost his wealth lost all these things but brother branham would tell us job only had one way and that's through fellowship through the shedding of the blood he talked to god he knowed that he was and god had confidence in job because he had fellowship with job you want god to have confidence in you then develop a relationship with god have fellowship with god give god more than a two-minute prayer give god your all god had confidence in job because job had a relationship and a fellowship and he said now may the branham tabernacle see that today the only way god can have confidence in you is not because you do something or not because faith to do something but it's when you have fellowship so let me just say this this morning maybe you're not on a mountaintop but it doesn't mean that god doesn't have confidence in you maybe you're at your breaking point but that doesn't mean that god doesn't have confidence in you see god has confidence in the faith seed that he deposited in you before the foundation of the world see that deposit that he made in you will outlast anything that you face here on earth that deposit that he made in you is stronger than any demon power that's trying to destroy your life that deposit that he made in you will conquer any situation that's trying to conquer you this morning god has confidence not only in you but in the seed that he deposited in you and what shall separate us shall trial persecution tribulation nothing can separate us from the love of god so but when we have fellowship with god when we have fellowship then we know that we're predestinated we know that we've been adopted and we find here in ephesians 1 and verse 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will notice god has a will god has a plan and god has a way and you're here this morning because of god's will god's plan in god's way to the praise of the glory of his grace where he has made us how many can say i've been made accepted he has made me accepted in the beloved yet one day i was going contrary to the move of god or to the plan of god but yet god saw something inside of me god looked beyond my failures god looked beyond my sin god looked beyond my flaws and god saw the deposit and he said i'm gonna make sure on that deposit i'm about to get benefits i'm about to reap rewards from that deposit and so god forgets to move on that deposit and begin to pull your heart and bring you into a relationship with him what does he do he places you predestinates you unto the adoption of sons and adoption is positionally being placed there ain't a devil in hell can take you out of that place there's not a devil in hell can move you out of that position there ain't a situation that you face can uproot you from where god placed you the bible would say in whom we have redemption verse 7 through his blood and forgiveness of sin according to the riches of his grace wherein he had to bound toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ but which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him and whom we also have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose god's purpose will never be defeated predestinated according to not your purpose not a denominational purpose not a man's purpose a man's idea but according to the purpose of god of him who worketh all things after the council of his will god knows the intricate details of your life in the things that you go through whether you're here or whether you're here it all plays into the purpose and plan of god but we've been when you have that relationship you know you've been adopted you know you've been positionally placed and i want you to know this morning sometimes we don't feel like sons of god sometimes you don't even feel like you're saved but i want you to know right now we are sons of god because i'm not looking at my failures i'm looking at what the word says and the word says beloved now we are the sons of god right now we are this minute this moment this service no matter what we're facing no matter the sickness in our body no matter what we're going through we are sons of god and in a devil in hell can come against that sonship god calls you god place you and god's anointing you for this moment right now we are sons of god no matter what we're facing no matter what we're going through no matter the sickness no matter the difficulty no matter the situation we are now and have been adopted positionally placed as sons and daughters of god we had the nature of god we had the character of god our conduct matches the father we've been accepted into beloved we have redemption through his blood we have forgiveness of sins he made known unto us the mystery of his will we've obtained an inheritance and we've done all this because why because we have been predestinated according to his will all glory to god this morning so no matter what you're facing you've been predestinated brother rose to the will of god god has confidence in you this morning young people god's got confidence that you're going to rise above the lukewarmness of laodicea god's got competency it's your character your conduct that gives god confidence in you your character and your conduct that gives god's confidence in you that's the reason problem says that's the reason we haven't got a great church marching on today is because god can't find people to put his confidence in the holy spirit keeps saying well they're tearing up here they're breaking up they're doing this they're off on the lines stay with god's word that's god that's true that's the pattern that's the blueprint he says that's the reason the church today got all kind of isms and everything because it don't stay with the word they won't listen to the holy spirit the holy spirit won't testify them another thing but god's word sees but i want you to know there's a bride in the land today there's a bride in the land today that he has confidence in there's a bride in the land today that her conduct pleases him her character matches his she knows what he wants done with the word or she keeps still she has the mind of god she has thus saith the lord in the rising of the son the prophet of god says she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him oh if you'd ever let that revelation strike in your heart she is him i'll tell you no matter what you're facing in life you you're not your own but you're him you're a representation of him no matter what you're going through if you've been out there and you've been hungry for 40 days and you've been tempted by the enemy but i want you to know let me tell you he's got a word that says oh the word says this and the word says that keep pointing them back to the word that's what we got to do in this end time because the temptations are great but god is telling you this morning you are him the very manifestation of jesus christ this morning in a broad body god's got confidence in you though he got he's got confidence you're going to hold on how many of you got got a need of healing this morning you've been praying you've been believing god's got confidence in you brother aaron god's got confidence no matter some of you've been seeking the holy ghost god's got confidence you're not going to give up you're going to get it because why because you didn't put that seed there god did it you didn't put that desire for it god did it and if god put the desire there then there ain't enough devils in health they can only tempt they can only try to block the blessing but i'm gonna hear you tell you sure enough god will never let that deposit go unnoticed god is going to cash in on the deposit and it's going to come a hundredfold and a thousand fold and there's going to be sons and dollars of god manifest the holy ghost in the evening like tabernacle in the midst of laodicea somebody's going to rise up and overcome this wicked age i say mama that's me mama that's me that's who i am this morning i may not feel like a christian but mama i'm not looking at how i feel i'm looking at the word i'm looking at myself in the mirror of god's word and the word says i'm already healed the word says i've already delivered the word says i've already made it the word says i've already overcome guess what the word says mama that's me this morning i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god i got promises in the word oh hallelujah this morning he said don't let the devil push you here and push you there you're always mudded up always off the main roads you're always in and out he said you can't even have confidence in yourself if you're like that we should wash him one minute you're up next minute you're down and i understand we have mountain tops and valleys we're talking about little floundering fish just like this you know you shake somebody's hand i'm like no buddy you need a man up a little flimsy fishy handshake we don't want men and women like that we're christians we're rugged no matter what we face in the face of adversity we stand in the face of sickness when we're all alone we stand and haven't done all those stand we stand we don't give up we don't bend we don't bow we don't break we stand we're christians in the face of the enemy we stand in the face of love to see and we stand in the face of cancer we stand because we're not standing on our own word we're standing on dust saith the lord [Applause] verbum says it was behooven to elijah but coming to elijah the prophet that he made he stand to fulfill the word of god because he know the word of god he says but it's becoming to him in the midst of his trial in the midst of his criticism in the midst of indifference it's becoming to elijah as a prophet to stand to stand or take the stand of god and stand there and it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness the great mighty men foreshadowing this day when jezebel religions and things is raising up now things that we have have today trying to take over it's becoming to the servant of god no matter what anyone else says or what takes place stand see because it's becoming to us that we stay with the word don't stay with it until you criticize and give up you stay with it past your criticism don't stay with it until they make fun of you call you holy roller or make fun of your jump in your shout you stay with it because one day you're going to jump so high you ain't going to be here again [Applause] oh yeah i thought michael jordan could jump he could jump he set a record back then he jumped from the free throw line and dunked the basketball we're not talking about our free-throw line we talking about the line of time we're going to jump on into eternity look because while something's going to grab hold when you make that final jump that's going to be a holy spirit catch you and take you up into the higher height let me tell you you stand there and you keep jumping for god you keep standing for god you keep dancing for the glory of the lord we find in first peter i believe he puts us here for a purpose first peter 4 and verse 12. beloved thinking not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing has happened to you now i know we face a trial we face a battle looking around god why me what in the world brother aaron did i do to deserve this when i get right here it squeals i gotta move now brother tim i gotta move i'm not a hula dancer by the way just that's why yeah few is right beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing has happened to you but rejoice oh here we go again we can't ever be in the valley because we always got to rejoice no matter what you're facing rejoice rejoice in who your god is rejoice and know that he's bigger than your situation notice now but rejoice in so much as you are partakers of christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceeding joy see there is nothing that happens to a believer or that a believer endures but what god hasn't allowed or god hasn't purposed in your life so no matter what you're going through don't think it's strange say god what's the purpose let me yield to the purpose of god let me yield myself in this situation to the plan of god to see god not with human eyes but with the eyes of christ i can see the purpose behind it because i know nothing will defeat the purpose of god then we find in james one my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diver's temptation knowing this that the trying of your faith work is patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing so the fiery trial is a part of the purpose of god god has allowed it to mold you now i know some of you don't like molding you don't like to be rubbed the wrong way oh my oh yeah it got quiet real quick didn't they yeah the preacher gets up there and preaches all on your heart and he don't know anything about it but you want to say somebody told them but we didn't realize that the holy spirit is still a discerner of the intents of the heart the thoughts he knows what you have need of so he brings a certain little five foot six preacher in fiery and he's going to try to preach and teach this morning to you and he's going to rub you the wrong way a few times because god knows you need it and god's got a purpose behind it everything ain't sand castles and fairy tales this christian life is rugged now see if god god allows the devil to try you because god first he wants to show the devil that i got a bride on earth that will not fall she's going to stand no matter what you put her through she's gonna stand on my word on my promise because why she didn't call herself but i called her now sagen have you have you tried my little bride have you seen her down there she's a pure virtuous woman she's sinless she's virtuous she's a she's a daughter of the living god go out there and try her try with your pornography try it with this and try with that she won't be and she won't bow she won't break god's proven to your enemy that he's able to keep somebody in the midst of the work we're gonna say god's gonna have a young person god's gonna have a mom god's gonna have a daddy god's gonna have grandparents that's gonna stay true to the word of god [Applause] god is going to have a people that stays faithful to the word second is to bring us into a state of perfection now we don't like to be rubbed the wrong way we don't like trials we don't like tribulations we don't like these things but they have a purpose see there's a law of contrast we're going to go here for a little bit this morning let me set my watch all that was free just kidding i got my timer set just so y'all can relax y'all can get back into the service you are doing good program said now israel had its ups and downs it was the very type of the church today sometimes they were up on the housetops next time they were down in the valley you know in every service even here this morning there's some of you that's up here there's some of you that's down here there's some of you doing this and there's some of you that's doing that every service we have it so i'm thankful we have a church that when i'm not here you're there to bring me up and maybe when you're not here i'm here to bring you up brother aaron brother tim brother timothy deacons different ones other songs specials that song they're here to elevate us to bring us up but see israel had his ups and downs the very type of the church sometimes they were on the house tops sometimes they were down in the valley see that's what it takes to make us appreciate the good things see there's what they call the law of contrast the black man of africa never know that he was black his skin until he's seen a david livingston i'm gonna push this out y'all excuse me we're working on it when he realized his skin was black because david livestream was white it's a contrast you know he says you would never know how to appreciate day if you didn't have a night you never know how to appreciate the sunshine if you didn't have a cloudy day you don't never know how to appreciate righteousness unless you had some unrighteousness you never know how to appreciate good health unless you had foul health or bad health you never know how to appreciate these things unless you had an opposite to contradict it he said that's the reason why we appreciate the holy spirit so much tonight is because we lived so long in the church that were told that there was no such a thing as a holy ghost that's the reason we appreciate it tonight because we've had the other side we are struggling just a little bit see you never know how to appreciate mountaintops unless you've been in a valley you never know how to appreciate the mountaintops unless you've been down in the valley all the way through it's the law of contrast he says no you know we don't enjoy listen what he says you don't enjoy the ups unless we have the downs is that right do you realize we wouldn't have any mountains if we didn't have any valleys think about this for every mountain there's two valleys for every mountain top there's two valleys lebron make the statement he said the storms of life is what makes us have joy before you can have a victory there has to be a battle you don't just god don't push you through a pipe and pull you through the other side and you come out say oh bless god i overcame you had nothing to do with it but see if you want how many you want to victory this morning then prepare for the battle because it's going to be a battle you got to stand no matter what you're facing if you want the victory you got to go through the battle see there is no victories he says so now we ought to be thankful for the battles and the tryings it's god giving us the opportunity to have victories oh my don't that make you feel a little bit better now god's given his little bride an opportunity to have victory god's given a young person an opportunity to have victory god's given a young mother a young father an opportunity to have victory victory of what victory over this flesh freak over this world victory over laodicea victory over self-control god has given his little bride an opportunity this morning to rise in the midst of the darkest hour and to have great victory the battle comes along somebody says something bad about you sickness comes unto you he says maybe maybe god give you those light afflictions that he might heal you and show you his favor too let you see what it means what he means by that he loves you you know sometimes we call it tough love you're like i don't want that tough love no sometimes you need tough love we have all this coddling we do into our teenage kids today and they can't learn to bump their head or bump bruises or bruise that and we make a bunch of panty waste christians out of them they don't know how to make it in life they don't know how to be tough and rugged and make it on their own no sometimes you got to let them fall so they can stand i ain't talking about falling in sin i'm just talking about always just go okay my little baby my little baby my little baby your baby's 30 years old you need to get off of that come on let baby go on maybe growed up and got three or four babies of his own but see everybody my mama i saw i wasn't gonna do any joey-isms i apologize lord forgive me but everybody wants a hilltop experience come on just raise your hand be honest it's just us in here this morning everybody wants a hilltop experience they never want to take the valley anybody want to validate experience this morning i got no takers i'll get ready because it's about to happen he said everybody the pentecostal church too every night if you're not shouting dancing jumping up and down speaking in tongues running around over the floor something of another he goes you didn't have any kind of a meeting so brother joe you need to get quiet cause that's kind of how we are no just bear with me notice he says you know it's all right to be on the mountaintop that's good but let me tell you your fruits will freeze up there at night when the cold spells come cold spells when the cold spell comes you'll lose all your fruit that's what's happened now we put too much on mountaintop experiences of dancing of shaking and jumping around instead of the all-night prayer meetings down in the valley of decision where you have to come down there and meet god and really pour out your life until something takes place oh we let the fruits grow up there but the freeze kills it that's right every time it comes a little coals fell you know you got up there and nothing up there to rest upon the emotion dies down the shout's all gone the noises cease he says where are you at then he said the temptations come along and then you can't take it a couple years ago we took our family to colorado on a family vacation and we we visited pikes peak i don't know if you know but pike's peak is probably one of the tallest mountain peaks in all of northern america stands 14 115 astonishing feet in the air when we started up beautiful scenery oh it was just so gorgeous as you switched back and oh look at that that's so beautiful we were taking pictures look like a never mind like a bunch of paparazzi just click click click go to the other side of your oh oh i've never seen that before and it's just so gorgeous all the way up just glorious great views man it's so nice and then you get to the top hall rock all rugged but man you could see as far as the eye would allow beautiful i mean you're up on the top tallest mountain in all of northern america i stand fourteen thousand one hundred and twenty one feet how you say you get that extra six because i put six foot on top of that i was standing on the rail gave me extra six inches i'm five foot six bam i'm 14 120 one feet i can do math pretty quick whoa and i could see as far as the eye could see but when we stepped out of that van not only is it cold brother aaron but there's something called altitude sickness that begins to settle down on you and you begin like this and all you can see right but you're seeing two of everything it's beautiful if you could focus but see we were up there and my wife got altitude sickness she had to sit down because we're not made to live on that kind of height and your spiritual life is the same way oh it's going up the mountain is great it's grand it's got a lot of achievements it's got a lot of beautiful scenery it's got a not a nice switchback but you're not made to live on the summit god made you to live down in the valley when you plant that seed in the valley and the right amount of moisture and the right amount of sunlight and it begins to hit that seed it begins to come up because there ain't enough devils in hell can keep that seed in the ground but on the mountain top you wasn't made to live up there on the mountain top that seed or die that seed are free it can't bring forth life but it's in the valley it's in the valley that your life pushes out the gift of god it's in the valley that you usher out the gift of god i'm so glad though that here at evening like tabernacle when i'm in my valley some of you are on the mountaintop and we can come into a service and we can create an atmosphere no matter where we are we can create an atmosphere an atmosphere to pull somebody up if it's only for a moment catch a glimpse at this ain't it there's more to this life than my valley i got a glimpse i went high enough up that i could see eternity just around the corner i got a glimpse behind the curtain of time oh i've seen it oh i've been seen in a vision i've been seeing all that second bride when she come marching through she was the same as the first prize same in every detail let me tell you because the alpha has become the omega the omega is matching back to the alpha the same bride that was in the beginning is the same bride that's here today oh churchill we're not going down we're going up in one moment oh hallelujah but see real spirit-filled leaders real spirit-filled christians of the pentecostal move they recognize that something happened they cooled off because everybody's trying to live on a mountaintop and they're going off without god he says what we need is to get back to god get back to the experience get back see our life your life my life no matter what position you play in the body your life has pros and your life has cons he says we got to have pros and cons that's the way it goes you got to have good days to make you enjoy the or bad days to make enjoy the good days you got to have a little sickness to make enjoy good health you have to have the valleys to make you enjoy the mountain tops and so then some of these days it'll be all he said it'll be all mountain top it'll be all good health it'll be all god but it'll be all joy but until then pros and cons and it seems like for most of us there's more cons than there are pros there's more struggles than there are joys there's more hardships than they are mountain tops seems like we're always in a trial how many and i'm not passing gloom this ain't no gloomy messes this morning if you down in that trial and you gloomy you need to learn to praise god in it but notice now just as soon as you come out of one trial you're back into another but the bible says many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivereth out of them all god's not going to leave you in that valley god's not going to leave you in that sickness god's not going to leave you in that trial god's going gonna raise you up to that mountain peak and let you look over the corner of time and see that this life is not your final resting place god has provided something better for you church so we find there's times we get down there's times we get depressed we get nervous we fret we get anxious we have fears we have sicknesses we lose the love when we deal with loneliness we deal with disappointments this life is full of cons but it's so refreshing when we can have a pro it's so refreshing when we can come into the house of god and the presence of god begins to move and you may have walked in with a con [Music] dragon all around mully mullet grub but then the spirit of god in the song service on my best days i'm a child of god on my worst days i'm a child of god no matter where you are you may have come dragging a pro in but on your worst day you're still a child of god on your worst day you've still been adopted on your worst day you've still been you've still been born again of the spirit of god on your worst day oh if that's your worst day then what about your best day what about in the presence of a living god on your best day ain't a devil in hell can stand before you on your worst day much less your best day on my worst day satan i'm a child of god [Applause] you fight this move another spirit becomes all of a sudden the shackles of the cons fall off your life whoa and you begin to oh tap your foot you know y'all see brother joe upper dancing a little bit moving brother l yeah brother hell i got it too now we mississippi boys right there buddy but it's a sad thing here it's a sad thing when people want to try to rob you of your mountaintop they want to rob you they they watch in on the videos and they see young people move with the spirit or they see a young mother running around with a little baby in the arm because they don't know what god's just done for or they don't know what god just done for me they don't know what god just done for you they don't know that he'd come by that the healer had lost his touch and he'd come to your address and they touched you and you coming to a service oh you may have been packing a bunch of coffee but all of a sudden the pros of god the hebrew came by and it touched me and he touched me and he made me whole everyday you don't know like i know what god's done for me oh and i was sick he raised me up when i was in sin he came to touch my heart oh you don't know like i know don't you try to steal my son don't you try to steal my debts don't you try to steal my joy you don't know i say you don't know like i know what god done for me let me have my mountain let me have my moment let me have my days let me have my joy you don't know you don't know where i've been but he knows see we learned we learned to appreciate those very few mountaintops or those pros but see us in the valley when those roots begin to sprout and the winds of life begin to blow those winds have a purpose not to uproot the seed that seed shakes a little bit goes a little bit deeper shakes a little bit a little bit deeper for god allows the winds of life to blow across you your path for a purpose of making you a stronger christian so brother joe i'm in a valley i'm in a valley let me tell you what you do when you're in a valley you want me to quit right now want or know what do i do brother joe when i'm in the valley take your bibles and turn to second kings 3 16. moab was coming against the king of israel the king of judah and they was out of water they didn't have water for the cattle they didn't have water for the men they didn't have water and they went before the prophet of god elisha and they said elisha we need some water elijah said you want boy you want water this is what i want you to do it's going to seem absurd it's going to seem ridiculous you make this valley full of ditches now what in the world you could have gave me a plumb line i could have went to the river push it down here no make the valley full of ditches [Music] [Applause] oh brother i'm in my valley then dig a ditch for healing these for deliverance take a dish for the holy ghost dance for the prodigal take a ditch take a ditch you make that valley of yours full of ditches because god said it won't be by wind it won't be by this but i'm gonna water that land notice what he says now shall not see wind neither shall you see rain yet the valley shall be filled with water that you may drink both ye and your cattle and your beast next verse and notice and this is a light thing he can provide water where there was no water this is a like thing in the sight of the lord he will deliver the moabites also into your hand next verse and you shall spite every fence city every choice city and they shall fall every good tree and stop all the wells of water and mar every good piece of land with stones next first and it shall come to pass in the morning when the meat offering was offered that behold there came water by the way of edom and the country was filled with water so when you're in your valley dig dig dig dig dig dig dig every promise is mine i'm digging i'm digging i'm digging i'm down on the tape i'm digging i'm digging my valley full of ditches and there's going to be enough water that you can't contain it's going to be enough water see elijah let me move on i got a few more minutes here i didn't say i was closing no i'll do that five times y'all know when i do it elijah had a mountaintop actually if you go back in first kings 17 we're not going to read them all i'm just going to paraphrase second our first kings 17 and verse 1 he called for not to reign and it didn't rain i wouldn't mind having that kind of power but i don't you don't we don't but elijah did so he finds first kings 17 called for not to reign nor do the fall until it came his word and it dried up well look at 17 and verse 8 and verse 9 he goes to widows woman's house said give me a a cake to eat and realize he told her you make me one first that barrel of meal will never waste nor will your cruise oil ever run dry it never wasted until it rained we find here in first kings 17 and verse 17 he raises a widow's son who had died he stretches forth himself over the child and cried unto the lord when the life comes back to the young man we find him our opening scripture here first kings 18 he calls the prophets of baal he restored the altar first the power of god came down and licked up everything and dried it all up chased 400 prophets killed every last one of them he was on a mountaintop and noticed at the end first kings 18 he calls for it to reign notice he hears something i hear the sound oh i hear the sound of abundance of rain that was something it was time for the movement of the spirit i heard a sound for even like tabernacle it's the abundance of rain oh it's been a drought for a long time maybe you've been in the drought but i hear something this morning oh that rainy sea or that dry season is about to be over i hear something and he sent his servant up there and he saw a cloud by the size of a man's hand notice what he did call for it terrain and then he got on his garments and he cinched him all up and he outran the chariot this ain't no young whooper snapper he was an old man gray-headed i'd put him around 80. i don't know how what he was old man and he's out running a chariot i would say he was on a mountaintop called for it not to rain it didn't rain pray for the widow her meal wouldn't drop never dried up raised a dead boy back to life childing 400 prophets of bell called for it to rain out ran the chariot man everything he said came to pass bless god this is great amazing he didn't know what it meant to have a bad day that's what we look at we're outside looking in that's what our thoughts are man elijah man that guy's amazing he don't know what it is have a bad day i mean he just did this this this and this man he's just always living up here not the case it's amazing how soon one comes off the mountaintop we look here first kings 19 and they have no doubt you've imagined they have going home man jesse you know me tell you what this prophet just did jesse he destroyed all your prophets called them down there the man restored the broken altar they were calling out for their gods look they spent all day we were getting tired of it it was boring they kept calling they got up there they cut their self blood everywhere i mean it was an awful mess jesse but i'm going to tell you when elijah got up there he restored the altar he dug a dish they poured water on the thing three times i'm like i almost drowned because of so much water that's when y'all laugh but not only that man the power of god jesse come down and drunk up all the water took up all the offering looked up everything and then he chased your prophets and killed every last one of them but that ain't it he outrun my horses this man is unbelievable and you would have thought that that kind of witness would have turned her heart but notice what she says jezebel sent a messenger unto elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if i make not thy life is the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time and when he saw that he arose and he went for his life and he came to beersheba which belongs to judah and he left his servant there but he himself went a day's journey into the winters and he came and sat under a juniper tree and he requested himself that he might die we all have been there elijah receives a negative report this man called for not to reign he prayed for a widow's son brought a dead baby back to life destroyed 400 prophets and now he's running from a woman you would think man i'm going to take care of this little chick oh jesse with her little painted up face trying to ruin my parade i'm gonna tell you what i'm gonna do fire bam sucker up like the sons of thunder in the new testament will call fire down but he didn't do that because why because he was coming out of the anointing see he was on the other side of the mount carmel experience he was coming down and now you thought man this man doesn't have this this this this all these supernatural things take place there's no way why is he running from a little woman but i want you to know when you come out from under that anointing it changes everything and i'm going to go in here we're going to see see it's you can when you're up here you can pack the world away but when you're coming out of that anointing any little bitty thing just destroys you and it destroys your confidence and you run to the wilderness and you sit under a juniper tree now he's running for his life well the bible says elijah had a hard day he been on mount carmel he seen the glory of god come down he prayed fire out of heaven and then he prayed for it to reign upon the earth and all under his train his nerves were about broken oh how i feel for him see elijah he wouldn't compromise he told jezebel to her face what she needed to do and she despised him and threatened his life and the threat of his life what did it bring he didn't bring an international revival he'd have thought the whole country oh the lord he is god that's what they said one moment but jezebel put a death threat on his head the next see he was trying with all his heart within him to try to show the people that god was still god but it backfired and he runs into the wilderness when he heard it and there he laid under a juniper tree trying to find consolation see he was criticized and his life was threatened because he stayed with the word of god and you're going to be criticized but you've got to stay with the word of god you're going to be your values will be threatened but you got to stay with the word of god your beliefs will be threatened but you got to stay with the word of god they're going to talk about you they're going to make fun of you they're going to make fun of our running they're going to make fun of our tongues they're going to make fun of our dance but we got to stay with the word of god he didn't compromise on the word he didn't bend a little bit on doctrine he didn't preach a tickle-to-the-ear message he stayed with what god said no matter who his audience was he didn't preach an intellectual gospel no elijah demonstrated the dynamics of god he called for rain he called for it not to rain he called for fire to come down elijah demonstrated signs and wonders and i'm going to tell you this little bride is demonstrating the same supernatural god that elijah demonstrated he goes i wonder brother ma'am says this now i want y'all to listen in here i wonder sometimes i get so discouraged it's a wonder my wife can put up with me i go around after the meeting i feel so moody i cry while i walk around a while i say oh my i'm a total failure i don't see why the lord ever had anything to do with me this is your prophet see we see up here this one healed this one he'll disaddress this here this issue looking back looking forward looking here looking at man he never has a bad day my wife and he notice what he says my wife i walk around i'm so moody i cry out wow i'm a total i don't see one god while the lord ever has anything to do with me see it's coming out from under that anointing when you're up here up there you feel like you can pack the world away when you're down here though it's all right but it's coming between the two that's where it gets you for the aaron can testify some of you singers can testify especially when the anointing is on when you come out of it it's coming down it's what gets you and i want this message to encourage you see here a prophet of god felt like a total failure he didn't know why god would continue to use him see we're not alone we're not immune from these things these moments but we've got to learn to trust god because there's a purpose behind it see jonah here jonah was went into a belly of a well for three days and the well spit him out on the land he walked in there he converted the entire city they all repented and we find joan on top of a hill asking god to take his life when he come out of the anointing william calper here he's the one that that wrote the song that we sing there's a fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's veins when the center is punched beneath the flood they lose all their guilty stains he said did you ever hear what happened to him after the inspiration left from him he tried to find the river and commit suicide coming out of the anointing stephen foster america's most famous folk song here he was he got the inspiration and that inspiration when it left him he would go get on the drunk and finally called a servant and took a razor and he committed suicide brother bam says people don't know what the people that live in the spiritual realm go through see it's coming out of the anointing see elijah was up on the mountain top one he called for fire out of heaven and he called for rain out of heaven and it had not rained for three years what anointing called for a hundred a balaam priest and chop their heads off what a powerful anointing but then went down in the desert that the threat of a woman he run out into a desert and when the anointing left him he was 40 days wandering out there in the wilderness and god found him and pulled back in a cave that's right no need to try to explain it you can't see when you come out of that anointing so let me give y'all some words of encouragement or words of advice this morning canada it's never a good time to say anything negative to a man who's just poured out his heart whether you're joking or not that man has poured out his heart he's prayed he studied he's yielded he's given himself and you sometimes you know some people they just don't know how to keep their mouth closed you know they come out well you know this was good but they did they did their butt but what you just done is you sent that man right off the mountain he's coming out of that anointing give him time give him time give him a day or two there's time for corrective or constructive criticism you don't have to do it immediately after the service let him get back down to ground zero then you can give him that feedback my wife learned that we learned that together why'd you say that so loud you've been at my house know when i first started preaching and she'd tell me stuff right after service i'm like and she learned i can't tell you right now i can't tell you right now i'll talk to you about it later i'm like alright because later you can receive it right then you're coming out of that anointing so there's something about coming out of that anointing we think man elijah he's done all this but he's coming out of it now and now a threat of a woman sends him and running for his life so no matter how many positive comments that preacher that song special person may have done one negative little comment sends them to a juniper tree but let me say this you don't you don't have to lie about it you don't enjoy the service that's fine just don't say nothing he didn't enjoy that special that's fine keep your mouth quiet use some self-control some restraint that's good gospel teaching right there told you i was a teacher see the thought jezebel's response would have been man he shut the mouths of baal they didn't even respond and yahweh comes down pooh sucks up the altar but instead of repenting she was more determined than ever to take his head off and elijah when he saw this he arose for his life and he went to beersheba and he left his servant notice he leaves his servant there and he goes on by himself now he's dwelling with his own thoughts man look all i've done was try to serve god i did this god you told me to do this you know how sometimes we are we're going right we're running it through the middle of the night three o'clock in the morning running things through four o'clock in the morning we're running things through you're woken up and you're like oh my you got this running through your head lord i just did this at your will and this is coming against me and that's coming against me and now he's got all these thoughts and he's just wandering and he's just wandering and he's just wondering and he's just wondering and sometimes we despise we despise the juniper tree because we think it's a form of weakness and he's got these thoughts in the heat of the day of the journey and he finds this little sagebrush broom plant i don't know how tall it is it's tall enough for elijah to go sit under it in the middle of nowhere there's a little tree planted and he goes and he sits down he's tired he's weary it's been a long day he's come out of the battle he's coming out from underneath the anointing and he finds a place of rest so i say that this morning philippe said elijah and his nerves were on edge i always felt sorry for him his nerves were all about ready to break anyhow great great pound from jezebel for finishing stroke he says oh the experience of the juniper tree don't despise your juniper tree god put it there for a purpose because you're not meant to live on a mountaintop you're not meant to stay up here in the supernatural there's a time coming will there be all day no night all supernatural no human element to it but he says now there's many of us find ourselves under the juniper tree he goes i get myself one of them many times it's a place that i that i just you just don't know what to do you're frustrated he says frankly i'm right under it now and i'm wondering oh god what would you have me to do see the juniper tree is a part of the christian experience god has a purpose for the juniper tree you find yourself there this morning don't question why am i here don't question don't fight it don't struggle with it rest you find yourself you may not be here but you're down here and you're at your juniper tree rest matthew would tell us in 11 28 come to me all ye that are labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest find yourself at this juniper tree because the heat of the battle you're just coming out from under the anointing see rest in god's peace rest in god's promise resting god's provision for you resting knowing that god has a solution to all your problems rest in knowing that god said he'll never leave you nor forsake you rest in knowing that god is a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of your infirmities resting knowing that the trial hasn't caught god off by surprise resting knowing that this is working to your good see god has a purpose for what he allows to come your way but you gotta rest you gotta rest he said there he laid under a juniper tree he didn't know what to do his nerves were broke up he was all shaking he was crying no doubt he was in a terrible condition and many of us hit those places especially after a mount carmel experience they asked him said brother branham what do you do what can be done for a time like this he says there's only one thing that you can do is commit yourself to god that's all that we can do he said god has to do something for every man that comes under the juniper tree or he'll go to pieces god has to do it so don't be looking at yourself don't look at your neighbor you look to god god i'm under my juniper tree i need your provision god has a purpose for the tree and god's purpose will not be defeated the man says i've had those feelings after i come out of a meeting i look like i tried i preached i begged i persuaded i see the angel god sweep through the meeting and do signs and wonders and said in the car on the outside and i hear them crying say oh it was nothing but psychology there's nothing to it nothing to it at all a bunch of nonsense he goes oh i then i crawled under a juniper tree and i think lord what did you why did you let me do it what he says what can it be done it says but with all these experiences but the mercy of jehovah to his servant he said god knows your trials just know this he knows all about it god knows your trials he knows all about it oh poor little skinny old man laying there gray hair hanging all over his shoulders and god's looking down at the scene my servant he needs some rest tired of the hospital tired of the trials of life tired of the sickness in the body tired of disappointments that they're facing tired of not knowing he's weary look at him and he had a great service couple weeks ago a couple sundays ago or maybe a year ago at a camp meeting my young person and now now they're just weary and not where they need to be but know you're exactly where god wants you to be you're at your juniper tree for a purpose notice what he says i love this he goes i can imagine there was ten thousand angels watching elijah's sleep oh man all i'm looking over and he snores pretty good don't him he must be tired and i'll tell you that mount carmel really got him and looking over like my that's god's prophet look at him you know we looked at and said man i thought he was somebody i mean he did this and now he's under a lazy tree little lazy scaggy wag i got all kind of little pet names at the house call them skank-a-doodle dishes that little skank laying underneath there that's kind of the mindset we have but we don't know where he's been we don't know what he's been through we're outside looking in they're up looking down they seen where elijah's been they know what he's been through they know the struggles that he's faced and here ten thousand angels watching god's prophet sleep brother baby says there is one assurance the believer has though the world turned them down god loves him though the world may turn you down there's angels over the banner looking down this morning saying god loves you god loves you god loves you you may be an outcast of society you may be disrespected or discarded over here to this way or that way but god loves you i'm here to tell you this morning god's got angels and kept about all those that fear him they're looking above the pastor this morning looking down into this service they know that you're propped up against the juniper tree and they know that god has got something special for you because the angels of god are there to pack you some mighty vitamins to give you strength in your weakest moment oh here he said the world may call you a holy roller may call you a fanatic but if you're true to god there's one thing for sure god loves you and his angels aren't camped about those that fear him he goes i imagine on every limb all around through the place was swarms of angels and god came down he said my poor tired servant he's so nervous he's so tore up he don't know what to do i want to pick the angel hey you you come here you just got the softest hands you come over here and i want you to stroke his brow and i don't know about you but i love having my head rubbed man you just imagine an angel with the softest hands coming just rubbing what little hair i got oh my i'm out i mean here he was just loving it i could just imagine then he says i want the angel the best cook among all of them you go find the best vitamins and you cook him the best corn cake you can make and they come over there and woke him up touched him elijah arrives eat there's a cake on the coals and he breaks up i'm sure he barely was in a trance probably wakes up and he eats and he goes back to sleep angel's still stroking his brow oh i'm about to fall asleep right now thinking about it my honey wait till we get home i'm gonna take a nap and he's just stroking his brow the angel with the softest see god cares he cares for your juniper tree when you think you're there and you've done all that you can and it looks like god's forsaken you the people's forsaken you jezebel's on your trail god's got angels there feeding you supernatural vitamins because he knows he's not done yet god's not done yet there's more to the story probably i'm i'm so glad that there is a juniper tree when we get all war and tore up we can go underneath that juniper tree and find spiritual violence to travel any kind of trip sometimes you feel like he goes oh i did one time i put a pistol against my head to commit suicide i couldn't do it i took my glove off led on a high vultures line where i was working but i couldn't do it something still hell the same god that was with elijah that same god today he seen me under juniper tree my wife my baby laying under the grave there my daddy and my brother and all and i just go about go myself and i laid under juniper tree it's hard i got to a place that i was so beside myself i tried to make a gun shoot my brains out and it wouldn't do it see there's work yet to be done something has to be done god wasn't finished he always takes care of you and i want you to know this morning if you find yourself under a juniper tree that's only a resting place it's not the end of the journey there's more to come it ain't over until god says it's over he ain't finished until god says it's over i'm gonna entertaining you don't know like i know what god's done for me he brought you off the mountain he brought you into the valley he brought you to a juniper tree he's feeding your supernatural food and due season let me tell you god's got more for you church [Applause] it's not the end of the journey he knows where you are at tonight you may be under a juniper tree everything gone but remember he knows where you're at oh thank you lord he sent an angel and the angel touched him and he went to sleep and he woke up and there was corn cakes some kind of cakes baked laying by the side elijah arise arizona and there's the grace of god to a servant and he's resting and see god he sent us an angel on this day one that provides what substance for the journey elijah was feeding on corn cakes baked by the angels we're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man spiritual food in due season and this is due season this is my season this is my journey i find myself under the juniper tree lord i'm going to rest i'm going to rest in your provision i'm going to rest in your healing power i'm going to rest and thus saith the lord see elijah found a refuge in the middle of an oasis and the problem would tell us the bible would tell us notice here give me just a minute well i think it's in psalms here i got to find my place excuse me psalm 61 and verse one the chief musician uh negana the psalm of david hear my crowd god attend to my prayer from the end of the earth will i cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than i when my heart when my life is overwhelmed pressure stress anxieties fears depression when my heart is overwhelmed lead me lord lead me to the rock that is higher than i lead me to that thing that is bigger than i am that is bigger than my situation that is bigger than my cause that is bigger than my sickness that is bigger than my struggle lead me to the rock the revelation that is higher than i am the revelation that i am a son of god no matter what i face no matter what i go through no matter what i endure i am a son of god i have been called for this purpose notice now he says for thou has been a shelter for me a strong tower from the enemy i will abide in the tabernacle forever i will trust in the covert of thy wings psalms 9 and verse 9 the lord will be a refuge for the oppressed a refuge in a time of trouble psalm 62 and verse 8 trust him at all times he people pour out your heart perform god is a refuge for us say love psalms 91 and verse 2 i will say unto the lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him will i trust psalms 142 and verse 5. i cried unto the lord and i said thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living here elijah found the refuge when he was at his breaking point weakest moment crying out to god to take his life he found a refuge on a place that just you would have never thought a juniper tree a sagebrush a balloon a broom plant he was tired and weary but god cared for his prophet he goes oh i think the lovely kindness of god showed to elijah when he took him out from underneath that tree and he says i believe that juniper tree was put in the ground there for that very purpose god planted that tree many years before because he knew he would have a wondering prophet come and need to find rest and god has provided you a tree two thousand years ago he cut down a cross and he planted it in the ground and he hung his son on it so that that weary wayward sinner could find rest for his weary soul not only find rest but to receive supernatural vitamins to continue the journey because the journey's not over so juniper tree is only a stopping place it's not a permanent place but it has a purpose he goes oh what we need in this journey that we're in now is to find a place of rest and to feast on the word of god so that it'll give us strength when you're underneath your juniper tree i want the musicians to come sister rebecca when you're underneath your juniper tree filling all alone down in the dumps just start playing softly i'll let you know when i want you to start just be assured that god has allowed you to come to this place for a purpose it may appear that you're at your breaking point may appear that you can't keep going [Music] but just as god had a purpose for the mountaintops god has a purpose for the juniper tree experience in the vast desert all along god led his servant to a shade tree and i believe god has led all of us here this morning to an oasis a place of rest we can come busyness and struggles of life leave it on the outside we come in here as a refuge a place of rest [Music] same god that stroked elijah's head and his brow is the same god is here to stroke yours this morning you may be weary you may feel like giving up you feel like giving in you feel like throwing in the towel and calling it quits he's got the angels here this morning encamped around this service with the softest hands to take care of your need he knows your need all he has to do is dispatch him for the johnny he knows that arthritis dispatch it take care of that see he hasn't left you to wander in your wilderness alone he hasn't forsaken you he hasn't left you to face your trial or your sickness alone but he's provided a juniper tree place of rest and when you a place where you can go and sit down and you can refresh yourself from the heat of the day the struggles of life and you can receive spiritual food see god's provided a tree for us in this journey a juniper tree was a purpose god's gonna make himself more real to you at that place see when elijah was calling for not to rain there's no mention of god and called for fire to come down god wasn't just there like that wasn't personal so much we did all these other things but when he was there underneath that juniper tree god dispatched angels and they came to his side and they began to caress his servant show him eternal attention special attention supernatural food a special meeting maybe it's miss meeting this morning may just be for one person because you're or where elijah said and you know god i just need something brother i'm saying god has to do something for every man that finds himself underneath that juniper tree you can't do it for yourself god has to do it see elijah he found himself there and he wanted to die god take me i'm no better than my father's and many of us we've been there heat of the day the battle lord just i'm tired throw my hands up we can't figure out what's wrong you know doctor said this but i want you to know the doctor's report is not the decree your sickness is not the finality of your life it doesn't have to dictate what god has for you the juniper tree is only a stopping place not a final resting place it's just a journey and we keep on keeping on we don't give up we don't give in elijah kept he wanted to die he kept looking back man he done this great things and now here comes the threat of jezebel and he's got depression and he's got anxiety and he's got fears but all let me tell you all he can think about is what is about to happen to me i've done all this at the hand of the lord i'm the only one left [Music] you know what elijah failed to see elijah failed to see his greatest experience was just a couple chapters away elijah failed to see all he could see was was just threat all he can see is jezebel coming after him all he can see is there's going to be this whole thing and they're going to take them but elijah failed to see that his greatest experience was just a few chapters away and we find in second kings verse 2 and it came to pass as they stood still they went on and they talked and behold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and then part of them both asunder and elijah went up in our world went into heaven and you may feel like giving up you may feel like giving it all you can see your sickness all you can see is your trial
