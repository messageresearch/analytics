[0:01] [Music]
[0:18] When the music fades
[0:22] and all is stripped away
[0:25] and I simply home.
[0:30] [Music]
[0:33] Longing just to bring
[0:37] something that's of worth
[0:41] that will bless your heart.
[0:44] [Music]
[0:47] I'll bring you more than a song.
[0:52] For a song in itself is not what you
[0:57] have required.
[1:00] [Music]
[1:02] You search much deeper within
[1:07] through the way things appear. You're
[1:11] looking into my heart.
[1:15] [Music]
[1:18] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[1:24] And it's all about you.
[1:28] Oh, it's all about you, Jesus.
[1:33] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I made it
[1:39] when it's all about you.
[1:43] It's all about you, Jesus.
[1:49] [Music]
[2:04] King of endless worth.
[2:08] No one could express
[2:11] how much you deserve.
[2:14] [Music]
[2:19] Though I'm weak and poor,
[2:23] all I have is yours.
[2:26] Every single breath
[2:30] [Music]
[2:33] I'll bring you. More than a song
[2:37] for a song in itself is not what you
[2:42] have required.
[2:48] You search much deeper within
[2:52] through the way things appear. You're
[2:56] looking into my heart.
[3:03] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[3:09] And it's all about you.
[3:13] Oh, it's all about you, Jesus.
[3:17] I'm sorry, Lord, for the things I've
[3:22] made.
[3:24] When it's all about you,
[3:28] it's all about you, Jesus.
[3:32] [Music]
[3:33] You're worthy of it all.
[3:38] [Music]
[3:41] You're worthy of it all.
[3:45] [Music]
[3:48] For from you are all things and to you
[3:53] are all things.
[3:56] You deserve the glory.
[4:00] [Music]
[4:03] You're worthy of it all.
[4:08] I give it to you, Lord. You're worthy of
[4:13] it all.
[4:16] Yeah.
[4:18] Heat.
[4:20] [Music]
[4:28] Oh,
[4:30] [Music]
[4:37] [Applause]
[4:45] [Music]
[4:48] heat, heat.
[4:51] [Music]
[4:58] Oh, can you stand and tell him now with
[5:00] all your heart say you're worthy, Lord.
[5:03] You are worthy of it all.
[5:10] You're worthy of it all.
[5:17] Yes. From you are all things and to you
[5:22] are all things. Lord, you deserve it.
[5:27] You deserve my worship, Father. You
[5:29] deserve my praise. Say you're worthy of
[5:34] it all.
[5:39] Oh, you're worthy of it all.
[5:48] of your own.
[5:51] [Music]
[5:54] Yes, you deserve the glory.
[6:00] [Music]
[6:01] Yes, you're worthy of it all.
[6:09] You're worthy of it all.
[6:13] [Music]
[6:16] Oh, and from you all.
[6:20] [Music]
[6:25] You deserve the glory.
[6:29] Oh, can we just tell him one more time
[6:31] before brother Danny comes? Lord, you're
[6:33] worthy of it all.
[6:41] You're worthy of it all.
[6:46] Lord, you've given me the very breath
[6:48] that I use to praise your name. And I
[6:51] just want to tell you, you're worthy.
[6:54] Hallelujah.
[6:57] You deserve the glory.
[7:00] [Music]
[7:01] [Applause]
[7:02] Sing one more time. You're worthy of it
[7:04] all.
[7:05] &gt;&gt; Worthy of it all.
[7:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.
[7:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:11] You're worthy of it all.
[7:15] [Music]
[7:18] Oh, from you are all things.
[7:23] To you are all things.
[7:27] You deserve the glory.
[7:30] [Applause]
[7:31] [Music]
