this is a late hour and it's time to go and we don't have time to play with the world we don't have time to flirt with the world but lord it's going home time hold I just pray that you'll take control of this service now each person each Heart Lord in Jesus name we pray amen amen if you have your Bibles with you tonight we're going to look into the book of Ezra first chapter the first verse and we'll be reading quite a few scriptures as we go may even read some from a few historical accounts you know the Lord lays things on your heart sometimes and I I was even telling brother Tim earlier tonight I said you know and within ourselves as human beings what we always want to do is preach the people happy you always want to come with something within yourself that that is going to make everybody happy but the thoughts that the Lord gives you isn't always that way and so you know um I was sitting there in his sermon Sunday really blessed me because the Lord was already leaning me in this direction and and as he preached that it just really confirmed to me where I was supposed to go so you just join in with me tonight and we'll and we'll Feast on the word of God Ezra 1-1 says now in the first year of Cyrus King of Persia that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus King of Persia that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing saying thus say Osiris King of Persia the Lord God Of Heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he had charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem which is in Judah who is there among you of all his people his God be with him and let him go up to Jerusalem which is in Judah and build the house of the Lord God of Israel he is the god which is in Jerusalem amen you have your seats tonight we just ask the Lord to add His blessings to the reading of his word amen what we're seeing here what we're looking at is we read this scripture we have come to the end of the Babylonian Empire and the beginning of the Persian Empire we know that up until this time the Jews have been serving the king of Babylon for 70 years just as the Prophet Jeremiah had foretold in Jeremiah 25 and it says in Jeremiah 25 11 and this whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment and these nations Shall Serve the king of Babylon 70 years the Scripture it also told that Babylon itself would be destroyed he that it would be destroyed and that the Lord would pour out his wrath upon that nation and recompense them according to their deeds and it says in Jeremiah 25 12 and it shall come to pass when 70 years are accomplished that I will punish the king of Babylon and that Nation saith the Lord for their iniquity and the land of the Chaldeans and will make it perpetual desolations and one thing that I want to point out right here even as before we go any further is that in your life and on this Earth to all Humanity the devil has not gotten away with one thing there is not one thing that he's gotten away with the Lord says that I'm going to use Babylon I'm going to use King Nebuchadnezzar to punish you for your evil Deeds he says you have not heard all of my words you have not regarded my judgments and because of that I'm going to allow these things to happen to you I'm going to use Babylon as my instrument are meant but then I'm going to punish that King and that Nation for their iniquities and what they do unto you and if we look back we know that man was in the mess that we're in tonight because of the fall and Satan has had this run because of the fall and because of the deception that he brought in the beginning but it was because of man's decisions we're in this mess because of man man did this and God says okay you chose wrong and you've done wrong and you didn't listen to my word and because of that things are going to be hard things are going to be difficult and Satan is going to do some awful things but I promise you he says Satan will not win he may do this and he may do that and he may make things very hard but I promise you that the prayers of the Saints are being stored up there's not one that's been forgotten he has not gotten away with one thing in your life sometimes it seems like he's gained a toe hold sometimes it seems like things are going his way but if you'll just look in the back of the book he has not gotten a way with one single thing he will be paid back for all that he has done to God's children so God tells him he says I will visit you and perform my good word towards you in causing you to return to this place talking about the Homeland that they're being taken captive from listen he says I'm not going to leave you in that sinful condition Satan has had him he's doing his work and he's got Satan's eating but I'm not gonna leave you there but I will visit you I will bring my good word to pass he says because I know the thoughts that I have towards you he says I'm going to bring you back I'm going to pour out my wrath upon this Kingdom and upon this King but I'm going to bring you back to where you came from Israel had gone into captivity because they had fallen away from the one true and living God had done everything that he could to get the people of Israel to repent he had sent servants he had Sent His prophets and they had come and told them to turn from their evil ways he had told them to stay true to the Lord he had told them over and over and he was very long-suffering with them but they would not turn they would not repent they would not quit flirting with the world so we see in Jeremiah 25 and 5. they said turn ye again now every one from his evil way from the evil of your doings and dwell in the land that the Lord hath given unto you and to your fathers forever and ever and go not after other gods to serve them and to worship them and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands and I will do you no hurt and yet Israel continued to sin they continued to to to not hearken to the voice of the Lord and in so doing they fall into the Judgment of the Lord they continue to flirt with the world even though a prophet told them not to hello somebody they continue to flirt with the world they continue to pursue other gods even though the word told them not to listen one thing we have to come to to recognize is that sowing and reaping is a law of God there are consequences to your decisions there are consequences to your actions many times we look around we say why God why God why God and the answer is you you know I hate to be that way but we have to be real with ourselves so many times it's the devil and the devil and the devil and the devil didn't even do it you did it why am I here Lord because you chose to be there why am I going through this situation because that's the road you chose there is sowing and reaping to every decision that you make in your life we cannot flirt with the World Church we cannot act like the world we cannot dress like the world we can't give the world in worldly pleasures all of our time and then just expect God to continue blessing you continue protecting you continue in this umbrella where Satan can't get to you there comes a time where if you act like this Kingdom and you live like this Kingdom and you dress like this Kingdom then but you can't expect the protection from that Kingdom he says if you want to look that part and play that part and act that part then you get that part with them we have to recognize that we can't keep flirting with the world you can't just expect the blessings to continue especially when you identify more with the kingdom of the world than you do with the kingdom of God you're going to have to reap what you sow brother Brown says then these Brethren who has gone away from the promised land down into Babylon carried away because their sins had separated them from God in other words he didn't say because the Babylonians did this why were they in Babylon their sins their sins had separated them from God he says that I'm just old-fashioned enough to believe tonight this that when the church or any individual begins to play and flirt with the world you're going to have the same experience you get away from God you get away from truth he's saying your sins will separate you from God he says when you get away from God and you begin to flirt with the world and do things of the world you're going to have the exact same experience that Israel had somebody's going to come in and take you some spirit's going to come in and take you something's going to come and bind you up something's going to carry you out of the house of God it's going to carry you out from the protection of the of the word it's going to carry you out from the protection of your brothers and sisters when you continually flirt with the world brother Brandon says when you get away from God when you get away from truth you're about to end up in the exact same place that Israel ended up in captivity bound up your flirtations will always lead you further than you ever intended to go because you take that first step and you're scared and you're like oh I wasn't supposed to do that but then you take it again and you get a little bit more comfortable there and and everything's okay you know God didn't strike me dead I'm okay and eventually you go further and further and what happens is your conscience becomes seared to where things that used to be little things now are nothing and things that used to be big things are now little things and you progress in sin and you progress in your flirtation to where it becomes much more than a flirtation you become identified with the things of the world your flirtations will take you to a place of captivity take you to a place of slavery and imprisonment and when you get there there will be no joy there 'll be no Victory there there'll be no overcoming life there in that place you are defeated what are you saying brother I'm saying break your flirtations with the world go with our whole heart into the word go with your whole heart into serving the lord recognize there is but one true and living God well brother and I don't serve other gods what do you do with your time what do you do with your time what Idols you have lifted up in your life what Idols of Hollywood or Idols of entertainment what other gods are there that's drawing you away pulling you away to where God's looking at he's a jealous God and you've turned your back and you've got time for this and time for that and time for that but I just can't make it on Wednesday I'm too busy you aren't busy For Your Entertainment you aren't busy for your fun you are busy for your job but you look at this listen when you're proud you will always fulfill your priorities period you will always fulfill your priorities period if you didn't read your Bibles because it's not a priority if you didn't pray it's not a priority if you're not at church it's because it's not a priority and in that place you get drug away to where you're living in a lukewarm place and you don't even realize it but you're captive and you're bound up and there's no joy there and there's no Victory there but I don't want to leave you in that place tonight I want to tell you you don't have to stay there tonight you don't have to stay in that place tonight you don't have to stay bound tonight you don't have to stay defeated tonight I'm thankful you don't got to stay there but there's one who came and made a way there's Mercy for you tonight there's Grace for you tonight there's Deliverance for you tonight but you have to accept it you have to make the move you have to walk towards it tonight if you've been taken captive if your victory's been robbed if your Joy's been robbed if your dance is long forgotten if you've backslidden into captivity don't stay there tonight there's one saying come home I want to bring you back home I want to bring you back to the cross I want to bring you back to fellowship I want to bring you back to where you were robbed from where you were taken from he wants to bring you back home tonight you don't have to stay in that condition Jeremiah 29 and 10. for thus saith the Lord that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word towards you in causing you to return to this place for I know the thoughts that I think towards you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end what he's prophesying of is the end of the Babylonian Kingdom and there's a new king coming there's a Persian king coming oh come on Church you were bought you were taken into slavery you were taken into sin you had to serve that King you were Bound by that King but there's another king coming there's another kingdom coming there's one on the way that's going to break your bonds there's one on the way that's going to set you free there's another king coming to crush this Kingdom there's another King on his way let's go back to the beginning in the beginning man was taken captive of his own decisions he flirted with the world she flirted and she sidestepped one word of God what did Brother Branham say when you do that same experience same experience and so what you find just as Israel is taking down into Babylon we see that man is exiled from God man is carried away from the guard man is carried out of his presence and now they're serving another king now they're servants to death there was reaping now that must be done there was captivity there was sorrow Satan now ruled Satan now accept Authority brother Brown says sickness disease Affliction sin everything held the little group of Adam's race at Bay that no one could do nothing about where the law and the judgments and the prophets and everything that had been sent had failed nothing could be done human race was doomed the great armies of hell was marching on well trained and in their ranks every man to his place we were held captives we were held captive but there was a word that said there's another king coming it's equal saw him as a will in the middle of the wheel Daniel saw him as a stone hoot out of the mountain without hands Abraham ate with him underneath the tree there in mammary oh the prophets prophesied of him there's one coming that will perform his good word because he knows the thoughts that he has of you he's not going to leave you bound he's not going to leave you in captivity but he's coming to break your shackles there's another kingdom come in and he says I'll take you back home I'll take you back to where you were once at the Yoke of the oppressor is broken and that doesn't just go for Sinners tonight foreign it's not just Sinners that need to go back it's not just people off the street that don't know God that need to return you know good and well there's a lot of us who haven't returned all the way there's a lot of us that haven't gone all the way back to where the message was taking us to all the way back to the land of the Holy Ghost all the way back to the land of all things are possible all the way back to everything that Jesus died for back to every Redemptive blessed back to the faith of the fathers some of us still got some ways to go some of us may be a turn but he wants to take us all the way back all the way back not just part of the way not just a little bit he's not leaving us out here in the wilderness he wants you to cross over he says I'm taking you back I'm taking you where you came from this is not your home there's another home and I want you to go back I want you to go back come home All My Children he wants to take you back tonight but in order to go back there we got to go back where the message was taking us to you're not going to go back there if you don't go back now Cyrus the King of Persia had arrived in 539 BC and he crushed the Babylonian Kingdom then we'll go back to Ezra one and verse 1. now in the first year of Cyrus King of Persia he's come in and he's taken control that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus King of Persia that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also into writing saying thus say Osiris King of Persia the Lord God Of Heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the Earth he had charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem which is in Judah now notice Here Comes The Challenge who is there among you of all his people his God be with him and let him go up to Jerusalem which is in Judah and build the house of the Lord God of Israel he is the god which is in Jerusalem years ago before my daughter Aaliyah was born brother Tim preached a sermon about this but this word go up or Ascension the Hebrew word is Aaliyah today today it commonly refers to the act of Jewish people returning to live in Israel from other parts of the world if they if they go back to their Homeland it said they've taken an Aliyah and they've returned to their Homeland and the call of Cyrus here the King of Persia down Through the Ages has been used as an adage for an Aliyah very specifically this scripture speaks of via Leah it speaks of it again in second chronicles 36 and 23 thus saith Cyrus King of Persia all the kingdoms of the earth hath the Lord God Of Heaven given me and he had charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem which is in Judah who is there among you of all his people the Lord his God be with him and let him go up or let him take an Aaliyah he says now tonight this is where the rubber is going to meet the road because the challenge goes out who is there among you who's willing to return not who's there among you that's willing to say I believe the message no that's not what he said it was a proclamation the whole nation heard it they knew it was true it was signed by the king there was no debate as to whether or not this edict was from the King but he's saying who will go who's willing to take the challenge who's willing to go back this is where that we can we see that your shackles can be completely broken the prison doors completely opened but you still have to walk out you can see your captor defeated a message of Freedom delivered by the king and you still have to be willing to go history says if we were to attach a percentage perhaps those who left Babylon now Persia it would amount to no more than 10 percent possibly as little as five percent that is 90 to 95 percent of Jews who had been living in the Babylonian Empire by their own choice elected not to return home we'll stay here we believe the message brother Brown's a prophet but I'm not going all the way back there I'm not going all the way back to Pentecost I'm not following I'll follow it as far as that we're not a denomination I'll follow it as far as dress code but I'm not going all the way back I'm too comfortable right here where I'm at tonight we're speaking to you on the Comforts of Babylon the comforts of Babylon I read this and I thought wait what 95 percent declined to go and the reason is because for most of them Babylon was home they were no longer looking at themselves as pilgrims and strangers they were looking at themselves as this is where we live the Jews had assimilated and they were now in harmony with their new surroundings God forbid that we can ever become in harmony with the surroundings of this world they were now in harmony they were generally at peace with the Persians the medes and the scores of other ethnic cultures that formed the empire it doesn't even really seem possible how it got to this point these people that had yearned to go home these people that when it first started out and they and they were called out of denominations all they wanted was to go home all they wanted was was the power of God in their services all they wanted was to leave this place all they wanted was to get back home with the Lord Jesus these people yearned for whom they were pilgrims and they were strangers and they said we don't belong here they had once been so homesick that they struggled to even Worship in Babylon they couldn't worship Psalms 137 1 says by the Rivers of Babylon there we sat down yea we wept when we remembered Zion oh they wanted to go back we hanged our Harps upon the Willows in the midst thereof they couldn't even sing the songs of Zion they were so homesick they were so broken to think about it just hurt them so much for there they that carried us away captive required of us a song and they that wasted us required of us Merc saying sing us one of the songs of Zion oh they were being mocked I was saying about your great God now sing about your great king Now sing about your Homeland now oh and it hurts so bad how so we sing the Lord's song In a Strange Land if I forget thee o Jerusalem let my right hand forget her cunning if I do not remember thee let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief Joy remember O Lord the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem who said raise it raise it even to the foundation thereof oh daughter of Babylon who art to be destroyed happy shall he be that rewardeth thee as thou has served us happy shall he be that taketh and dashest thy little ones against the stones does this sound like people that are wanting to stay in Babylon does this sound like people that are happy and content and after a while many of the ones who originally had come died off and you had generations of those who had never experienced the Homeland for themselves they had never experienced freedom for themselves they had been bound up and held captive in dead churches their entire life the movement of the spirit was just a story the healings of people was just a story being filled with the Holy Ghost was just a story they had been captive their whole life and so they were comfortable where they were they were okay where they were they were born in Babylon it was all they knew everything was just a story and so when the king made the call to go up listen Israel knew how difficult this would be they knew the condition of the Homeland they knew between here and there there was no safety they knew it would be a difficult Journey they knew there was so much work to be done once they returned they knew the road was long and hard and when you're surrounded by difficulty and you're surrounded by laodicea and evil and sin and lukewarmness is all around and it's harder than ever to take in Aaliyah it's harder than ever to go up if all of this is just a story to you if all of this is just a story if it's not a reality to you then you're going to sit back and go no I'm good I'll stay in the condition I currently find myself in oh brother Aaron have you ever been to that home and know I've never been there but I've been in contact with it it's not just a story it's a reality and when it becomes a reality you don't care the hardship you don't care what you go through you don't care about the mocking I want to go back I want to be there I want to live there forever that's my home I can't stay here I'm not comfortable here the sins of this world make me sick I just want to go back because I've been in contact with that place but if you haven't and it's just a story then are you willing to fight for a story are you willing to give your life for what may be true it's got to be a reality to you you have to contact a living God for yourself because if you don't when it comes time to take the journey you're going to stay right Where You Are at first they hated Babylon at first they dreamed of home they prayed for home still in Psalms 137 verse 4 read this again how shall we sing the Lord's song In a Strange Land they say if I forget thee o Jerusalem let my right hand forget her cunning if I if I do not remember thee let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief Joy oh they longed for home it was their desire at that point to be in every service it was their desire at that point to pray every night they craved devotion time in the presence of their maker they couldn't wait till the doors open on Wednesday night it was their desire to serve him with their whole heart but soon they began to become focused on tarrying in Babylon you say brother Aaron we have to live we have to go about our regular life we have to have a house we have to have a car we have to have some pleasures that's fine I won't argue with that but you can never allow those things to replace your desire to leave here to replace your desire to go home you know Israel was actually given instruction to do just that they were given instruction to Terry they were given instruction to plant their potatoes as it were they were given instruction to thrive where they were at while they were there here are the instructions Jeremiah 29 and 4. the prophet says to him thus saith the Lord of hosts the god of Israel until all that are carried away captives whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon build ye houses and dwell in them and plant Gardens and eat the fruit of them take ye wives and beget sons and daughters and take wives for your sons give your daughters to husbands that they may bear sons and daughters that you may be increased there and not diminished and seek the peace of the city whether I have caused you to be carried away captives and pray unto the Lord for it for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace oh brother Aaron it sounds like they were doing exactly what they were told to do they were that's exactly what they were told to do but in so doing they lose focus verse 10 is the important part for it thus saith the Lord after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place they lose focus on this right here it became about tearing it became about being successful here it came about staying here how comfortable can we be here instead of he's coming back he's coming back and he's going to take us home yes I want to provide for my family yes I want a good living but he's coming back this is all the atomic father it's all gonna burn I want Eternal things he's coming back they get too caught up in the tearing too busy to think about leaving too busy for Wednesday nights they get comfortable in Babylon why shouldn't the opportunity to return to the promised land Why didn't it cause a mass Exodus from Babylon total I believe the scripture puts it at about 42 to 43 000 that came back out of Millions and they didn't all come at once they came in four different alias they didn't all just up and decide to leave they had become full and active members of the Babylonian Society many prospered so many second and third generation Jewish Babylonians had no interest in leaving that term their Jewish Babylonians struck me sounded a lot like message laodiceans they were no longer Jews of the Homeland they were Jewish Babylonians guys we can't be layout of sin this bride will by no means be a laodicea you have to break free of that tonight there's a king that broke those chains there's a king that said you don't have to stay here you can go back to the Homeland you can go back but you ain't gonna get back staying where you're at you're not going to get free staying where you're at you got to be willing to move you got to be willing to admit where you are before you'll be willing to move that's the problem that's why so many people don't Journey on and take another step because they can't admit where they're at and they're lukewarm and they're backslidden and they're cold and they're formal and so they stay in Babylon message layout of sins identifying as message but never breaking free from the hold of laodicea accumulating too much stuff along the journey and it keeps you from crossing over that's exactly what happened with Reuben and Gad and we dealt with that a few months back to where along the journey in the wilderness they had accumulated so many herds and they had so many animals that when they saw the grasslands on this side of the Jordan they said well it'd be better for us if we don't cross over I'm more comfortable on this side than I am in the promised land because of everything I've accumulated because of all My Success because of all the blessings I have don't let your blessings become a curse the Rich Young Ruler was mighty blessed but it's the blessings that turned into a curse that took him straight to hell because he couldn't walk away from him don't let your blessings be a curse don't let them make you comfortable here you can't get to listen look I don't know if you looked around lately church but things are getting pretty bad things are getting pretty awful if you're still comfortable here it makes me wonder about the spirit on the inside of you how can you be comfortable here I want to declare tonight we can't stay here much longer we can't stay here the fire is gonna fall and somebody's gonna take it Aaliyah somebody's gonna Ascend somebody's gonna go back somebody's going home you can't stay here much longer turn your focus from staying and turn your focus into leave it here go home go home go home go back we can't get comfortable here there's a call tonight there's been an edict by the king and he says who will go up who will take an Aaliyah who will do the Lord's work but Israel had settled down and got comfortable where they were because well we're God's chosen people we're in the message yet first it was awful in this foreign land you remember how it was when you first got saved when you first got that first touch of the Holy Spirit you wanted nothing to do with the world prayer was easy church was all you look forward to all week because you were miserable in a foreign land you didn't feel at home until you came into the presence of God and yet in this condition at first they pressed on and they even the the histories would say they maintained their National Spirit that's good and their religious identity they maintained it even in the midst of the persecutions even as the Babylonians would mock them sing us one of your songs but they hung their harps on the willow tree because in Babylon songs of Victory were hard to sing there was no dance in Babylon foreign at this time there were elders and there were prophets such as Ezekiel that kept the hope of returning home alive scholars believe it was during this time that synagogues were established no notice this is a good thing but they allow it to turn into a curse because Services began to be held they observed holidays in these synagogues they prayed in these synagogues they practiced circumcision here the Traditions the Traditions the traditions of their religion was carried on in these synagogues why do I need to go back to the temple synagogue right here in Babylon we're keeping the Traditions alive everything's going just fine right here and over time as their oppression seemingly got less they began to get very comfortable staying in Babylon and practicing their religion in a Strange Land why go home when we have synagogues here why go home and we can keep the law here and we can worship here why go back when we can still go to church and fulfill our duties and still be message and we can keep all the traditions of the message why do we have to go back we have this and they begin to settle into the tradition of the message the tradition of the law the tradition of what they were supposed to be they settled into the traditions of the Homeland and they began to allow listen there's nothing wrong with tradition if you're in my house my daughter is such tradition is very important like if you're like on Thanksgiving reading this well that's not what we ate last Thanksgiving and we have to keep tradition so I'm not against Traditions but they began to allow tradition to satisfy their craving for a living God they're Traditions began to satisfy them and instead of being miserable they began to feel comfortable instead of an overcoming life they had tradition instead of the power of God they had traditions and that tradition bound them and now the sum of those who had longed in the early years to leave Babylon who had longed to get back they had hung their Harps up on the willow tree and sorrow and now they decided I don't need to take my heart down again it looks just fine right there I don't need Joy on a Wednesday night I need you I'm Gonna Leave My harp at home I'm just coming to sit because that's my tradition I don't need my harp why do I need to dance in church that's not my tradition my tradition is that I come and I sit there and the Traditions begin to settle in I don't need praise I don't need to sing and dance I don't need to return to the faith of the fathers I have my traditions and their harp stayed on the willow tree and there were many who read the word and there were many who read The Prophet's message and yet they had no intention of leaving so there was no victory dance there was no shout there was no Deliverance there was no worship because they were comfortable they had their traditions brother Brown would say because they wouldn't walk after the ordinance of God wouldn't keep his Commandments God called King Nebuchadnezzar to come in and take them captive down into the land of Babylon many of us remember the famous old story of how they hung their harps on the weeping willow tree and they could not sing the songs of Zion all their victory was lost not because that God wanted to take it away from them but because their own sin had separated them from God that's the reason tonight that many of the Christians hasn't got the victory is because their sins have separated them from the blessings cut off out in a desert Place alone and our hearts are hanging on the weeping willow tree and we can't enjoy the songs of the church well I don't like that song then people run around the church and that song just works them people up and I don't like that beat I'm sorry that you're in Babylon I'm sorry that your harp is hung up somewhere and you have no Victory and you have no dance and you have no shout but don't get mad at me because I do and I'm also not mad at you for where you are I'm just telling you ain't got to stay there you can get your harp and you can join us you can taste of the Homeland and it won't just be a story anymore you can taste of the Homeland and suddenly you'll have a little bit of a shout you'll have a little bit of a dance why because you'll have a little bit of Victory and then you won't be so critical you won't have time to be critical because you'll have your own shout you'll have your own dance you'll have your own Victory and you'll look up and you'll be down the road from Babylon heading home going home go back home you can't go home with your heart still hung on the willow tree take your heart down enter into worship or stay where you're at and die [Music] and in that condition they lose faith and the task of returning home seems difficult the journey seems too long the work that awaits them seems overwhelming and they get bound up in Comfort they get bound up in Tradition history says there was another reason that so many of these Jews elected to stay in Persia it's because Judah was a disaster area the main city of Jerusalem had its defensive walls torn down that's exactly why they needed to go back and the temple was in shambles that's exactly why they needed to go back there was practically no working economy what would the returnees do for a living where would they live tents and temporary shelters didn't look very attractive compared to the well-ordered mud brick homes in organized towns and Villages that they resideed in in Persia you know they didn't have a problem staying intense when they were journey into the Promised Land when their goal was on getting to the promised land but now no no we don't want to stay in that kind of lodging look at our nice home who's going to take care of us the same God that fed you in the wilderness same God that brought water from a rock and Rain Mana down out of Heaven the same God that seen you through every other trial that's the god that's going to take care of you don't be comfortable in Babylon if you've got to leave a job leave a job if you've got to walk away from Friends walk away from friends I'm no one that'll be closer than a brother to you I know one that'll provide for you but whatever you got to do get out of Babylon get out of Babylon let go of your Comforts there's a call to go home do whatever you gotta do but you gotta leave Babylon their trust in God is no longer there they're looking at how hard it's going to be they're looking at material things listen tonight this ain't a message against stuff this ain't a message against being comfortable because you have air condition in your house amen this is about getting comfortable and too complacent where you're at in your walk being comfortable where you're at in your walk you should be desperate tonight for more of God you should be desperate to go back you should be desperate to return home this message didn't come so that just that you could stay in a denominational mindset the message didn't come so you could claim message and have the spirit of mystery Babylon on you sit by comfortable where you're at listen there's no victory in your comfort there's no Victory there in Babylon brother Brown says notice when they were captured and carried away into Babylon because they tried to impersonate the nations of the world what a beautiful picture today of the church trying to impersonate the world out yonder and carried away listen to this carried away carried away with their living the church lives just the same as the world does carries on acts just like it and everything else claiming to be the church you can't do that no sir your very life proves what you are you can't get so comfortable here that you began to live like the Babylonians you can't get caught up in living like the world you can't get caught up in your Pursuits of the world or the jobs that these yes you must have a job but always remember that we've been called to come out of her my people if that job will keep you here you need to leave that job come out of her my people it can't be a denominational life it can't be a Sunday in Wednesday life but here in laodicea that lukewarm Spirit tries to lure you to sleep and it tries to make you feel comfortable and it offers so many pleasures it offers so many Pleasures to keep you from advancing and yet because we got our traditions and because we do our duty and because we come to church on Sunday and Wednesday we feel like we're okay but it was their very Traditions that gave them a false sense of security it was the very traditions and the attending the services that made them think I don't have to go back it was those very things that made them think I don't need to go back and help with the temple I don't need to go back and help rebuild the wall I don't need to return why go back to Pentecost when I can just say I believe God sent a prophet why go to the upper room why shout and dance and do all those things when I can just say I believe on the Lord why go back because there's an edict from the King that says You must go back there's an edict from the King that says I'm sending you a prophet to turn your hearts back that's why you must go back it's not up for debate it's not up for well I think this and I think this the prophet was sent to turn your hearts back to the faith of the fathers you have no choice but to go back and if you won't go back it shows your colors brother Brown said that's what separated Judas from the others when it came time to go to the upper room he couldn't go there so when you refuse to go back there just look at the company that you're choosing to keep you are identifying yourself with one who will follow Christ up until the upper room which makes you a betrayer that's harsh brother and that's just in the west that's what brother Brown said that that's what separated him he could follow all the way up till The Upper Room you got to be willing to go all the way back you gotta be well brother and I don't have the Holy Ghost yet are you saying I'm Judas no I'm not saying that at all I'm saying you can't have the attitude of I'm not going you can't have the attitude of I don't need more you got to have the attitude of God if that's what I gotta have that's what I'm getting if that's where I gotta be that's where I'm going if you're calling me out of this place tonight that's where I'm heading I'm gonna do whatever you're asking me to do that's what I'm saying to you tonight that's what I'm saying to you tonight don't be like one that says I've got enough so I don't need to go anywhere you're too comfortable in Babylon foreign some of the Jews probably refused to move due to the Comforts of Babylon this is straight out of encyclopedia many of them had been born in Babylon during the Exile and they knew nothing else they were comfortable where they were what snared them what snared them the thought that they could have our religion in Babylon too the thought that I can be a message believer in partake of laodicea II no you can't no you can't what's gonna happen is one day there's gonna be a Rapture and because there's layout to see it found in your heart you're not going if you're gonna go then you have to turn back now you have to return home now they were snared by believing that they were okay because they were doing what Jeremiah the prophet said do they were building houses they were taking wives they were planting gardens are you saying they were snared by the message nope they were snared by what man made out of the message be careful say what the prophet said don't put your own little season into it don't put your own little twist to it because what men make out of the message is what snares people where they're at not what the message said not what brother Brown taught smeared by traditions and so because of this they no longer sense the need to return to Jerusalem and their faith became bound up their worship became bound up the tasks seemed too hard why do that when I can stay right here and still worship don't ever let that Spirit of Babylon cage up your worship cage up your walk cage up your relationship with the Lord don't ever get into a lukewarm walk and let that Spirit of Babylon of Leia to see us settle on your heart don't let it come in and bind your faith we got too many people sitting around with bound up Faith tonight well I don't have any faith that's not true Every Man Has a Measure of Faith but a lot of us have allowed that Faith to be bound up by lukewarmus and bound up because why do I need one it's time some of us turn our faith loose tonight quit speaking in doubt well my kids this and my son that my daughter this and this sickness and that sickness your faith is bound up your faith is bound up and I'm telling you that why don't you turn your faith loose quit standing there and spinning it around and around and around and around and the giant still standing there and here you are with your faith here you are with your faith this ain't heard a single Giant yet this ain't killed a single devil yet but your face still bound up in the slingshot but I'm telling you tonight one time if you'll just turn and lose if you'll just turn your faith loose come out of the cage get loose get free go home turn your feet loose and watch the Giants fall watch the prison doors open and then walk out walk out go back home return to Freedom return to Victory Return To Joy turn your faith loose tonight it's been bound up too long bound up too long turn your face loose let it hit the Mark tonight let it take your giant down tonight [Applause] loose your faith but you can't do it if you're comfortable here in Babylon quit spinning it round and round and round and cut it loose get out of your comfort zone take your harp off the willow tree sing the songs of Zion sing the songs of victory dance of victory dance Let Yourself Go Turn loose in his presence you're too comfortable here in Babylon taking Aaliyah tonight in the presence of God and go up higher shake off Babylon come on it gets on all of us it's like a smoke gets in everything but some of us get to where we kind of like it it's you walk around smelling like smoke all the time the stench your sins all over you the stench of a life that isn't overcome is all over you well nobody knows oh please everybody knows it's because people are talking no the stint Just Smokes all over you nobody gotta say nothing ain't no victory yeah I'm gonna leave that alone it was easier to live in Babylon the clothes the food the houses the gardens this ain't even in my notes but it comes to me so I want to tell you how many of you have ever heard of the Seven Wonders of the World well one of them was the Hanging Gardens of Babylon lots of debate about those Gardens because they haven't found any archaeological evidence but lots and lots of writings from that time period would say they were there and a lot of people think they didn't actually hang but they were actually built on rooftops so it looked like Gardens in the sky but the writings of more than one writer say and boy this has hit me when I read this that the king of Babylon built those because he had taken a queen from another country and he built those Gardens to make her less homesick for her home he made it so beautiful and so nice so she would forget about home because At first she wasn't happy there she didn't like it there she missed the rolling Lush Hills of home she missed all these things and he says I'll fix that if I don't care what Pleasures the devil brings in your life don't let it make you forget about home I don't care what he offers you or what he presents you or what sin and what Pleasures the pleasures of sin for a season forsake those things there's a Homeland we got to go to don't forget where you came from don't ever quit being homesick don't ever quit be drawing back home don't get comfortable here in Babylon no matter how beautiful they make it no matter what they offer you but Israel began to live like Babylonians they begin to eat like them they begin to dress like them uh oh enjoying all that Babylon had to offer and they were lulled to sleep because they had a form of godliness they were lulled asleep by their tradition of worship they still had service still called on God and the King says go up return to the Homeland I said no no we like it here brother Brahm says many times we let the world slip in that's what's the matter with our churches today we let down a little bit here and there the devil has come in from one place to the other taking a little bit slip in here just a little of this place here a little that place there and the first thing you know it's got the whole thing in a confusion but I pray to God that during the time of this old-fashioned rally that we're having here that men will forget their Traditions all the things that has hindered and lay aside every weight and come back to an Old-Fashioned meeting where people will be born again I pray that God will give us hundreds of Spirit-filled people at the altar there praying through to God over Sinners and things that comes in during this meeting he says oh what a difference but we don't feel like we have to do that because laodicea Babylon has produced an age of soft living and comfort he says the pressures of the Dark Ages was either bent or be broken bow or die it was the Inquisition the power the Empire backing up satanic worship be organized or pay with your life each age had its pressures for example a great burden of this last age is the pressure of riches and self-living and nervous tensions tensions in a complex age that were seemed unfit to live in one of the attacks is soft living comfort listen that's the last thing I wanted even like Tabernacle that's the last thing I want is a church where I can be comfortable in a lukewarm condition oh come on we're gonna get real here for just a minute because see that's what happened there in Babylon I don't want to be in a place where sin isn't dealt with from the pulpit I don't want to go to that church in mystery Babylon that denominational spirit says we don't have to go back we can worship on Sundays and Wednesdays and we can keep the tradition that is exactly what the message called us out of how dare us walked right back into that thing into that denominational spirit run from that comfort run from that Comfort there's no victory in that Comfort there's no overcoming life in that comfort there's an Aaliyah happening right now there are people turning their hearts back there's a people getting ready to leave there's a people getting ready to go and there's people that are comfortable there's people preparing to leave don't sit in your current condition get your heart down from the willow tree see originally they wanted to go back where to where they to what they were called to be to the land they were called to be in but they got so traditional look we get so true we get so dignified in churches and how we think people supposed to act to where everything has to be just a certain way we get so to where you can't say nothing in the church tradition get so into where it'll bind the ministry to where they're afraid to say something without somebody going because that just goes against our tradition a little bit well you shouldn't say listen I saw reading they were brother Branham he's talking about going swimming with his friends with no clothes on and then he turns around and equates that with how we ought to come to Jesus how dignified does that sound yeah I put it here in my notes he would preach about swimming with no clothes on in the creek and then relate that to how we ought to come he says he says didn't have much clothes to begin with and his overalls was only held up with a nail so while the other boys trying to get all their clothes off I just pulled the nail he says I think that's about the way we ought to come to Christ that's right with not too many Traditions to lay down just pull one nail and jump in that's all amen so I pulled the nail and the clothes stood there in the air how dignified he said I pulled the nail and the clothes stood there in the air he says I hit the water before the clothes hit the ground running as hard as I could go and never hardly able to get a haircut I come up my hair was hanging over my eyes they wanted to know whether the water was good or not they were sitting down taking off their shoes and stockings and things if I held up one finger it was cold two fingers was right well brother I got into another water one time let me tell you something it's the Waters of Salvation I hold up two fingers he said it's good come on in it's good come on in Hallelujah he says come try it for once that's right come on in oh he says don't be scared he said come on in Jump Right In just lay down all your Traditions now listen to your dignified Prophet strip and come right in he says strip and come right in how about you strip yourself of your pride tonight strip yourself of your tradition strip Yourself by what other people think strip all that junk off strip it all say I'm getting in the water I'm coming out of this I'm stripping down God you can have all of me I don't want this junk no more strip away all the stuff of the world strip away Babylon chip away they ought to see ya it's time to go home it's time to go home Hallelujah you can stay Sandy time to get away from all your traditional ideas musicians you can come get away from everything that you think the prophet said about this and about that and church order some of y'all don't ordered yourselves straight into a Baptist lay all that stuff down you're too comfortable in Babylon well we sing exactly so many songs and the preacher preaches exactly so we'll be dismissed by this time will you obvious ain't never come to church here and we're going to have one special we'll have as many specials as we want to have we'll sing as long as the Lord leads us to say We'll worship as long as the Lord leads us to worship we're not getting too comfortable here in Babylon to where we can't let the spirit move [Applause] going home going home foreign you've got too comfortable in your traditions I like not being too comfortable let me talk to you about this just for a minute I'm glad it's not just some tradition of worship to some traditional God in this church I'm glad that you can't be comfortable here with Babylon in your life when Babylonian garments are seen in the house of God it should be called out when Babylonian styles are seen in the house of God it should be called out when the pleasures of Babylon are becoming the pleasures of the people of God it should be called out cause then you won't leave we are not to assimilate into this culture there is still to be a distinct difference between the people of God and the world [Music] when he gets to the place that Brothers have to turn their head in the house of God that is a shame and if that girl that's dressed that way ain't an adult it's a shame on the father that let it happen what about boys boys Babylonian style same thing goes for you so now that's a little bit easier to hide but we see those Spirits at that most of the spirits of fashion are homosexual Spirits you say well I don't like that well if you look up one time who designs the clothes and it'll explain itself they talk about things that I read an article the other day saying they are purposely designing genes in a way that that would make the male shape look female by the way they designed the genes that's what they say not what we say that's what they say to make man's shoulders not look so Square give them outfits that take away the broadness of their shoulders when we see those things creeping into the house of God it should be called down we can't get comfortable those are the things of Babylon I want a place where there's Victory not a place where the harps are hung on the willow tree I want a place where the dance of Victory isn't mocked I want a place where the ministry can say what the word of God says so that I don't get too comfortable here it's good to be made uncomfortable from time to time it makes you check yourself at least if you have the right Spirit if you don't have the right Spirit then getting called out will make you angry [Music] listen I'm gonna talk a little bit about me for a second because it makes it easier to swallow when the preacher has a real moment all right I've always loved Sports shocker to a lot of y'all right now Hey listen now it's okay it's real moment I grew up in them my dad played my brother played I played my dad was a coach I was a coach enjoy sports do you think that I get upset when brother Tim or another brother comes and points out the dangers of loving those things or how wrong it is to make those athletes and those people a God or an idol in your life because it's a balance that needs to be brought that I need to hear [Music] because I might get too comfortable [Music] so when the man of God comes and he hits on something that you like to do and we go he's talking about me I go thank you Jesus for talking about me thank you Jesus for calling me out thank you for pointing me back to a balance thank you that you love me thank you that you care thank you that I'm not getting too comfortable here in Babylon I needed that balance [Music] look at that [Music] I don't want to get too comfortable here in Babylon brother Branham says and I know I've got you standing I'm done brother Brown says what did David say yea either I'll walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me walk with him now he will walk with you in the valley thy rod and thy staff they comfort me now here's the Comfort we're supposed to look for the correction of the Lord comforts me they let me know that God is with me because he corrects me from my wrongs maybe he's trying to correct you tonight why don't you let the rod and staff comfort you the rod is the hard preaching gospel but it's a comfort to let me know that God speaks to me when that type of gospel is being preached to correct me he loves me he wants me to come walk with him now and then he will walk with me in that hour church we can't stay here I left so much unsaid about how the evils of this world tries to comfort you they can't the world can't offer you real comfort they can't offer real because they try to offer material comforts try to offer you The Gardens of Babylon to get you to take your mind off a home try to get you comfortable living here but the king said who will go up who will return who will go back he says is there any among you who's willing to go back home and do the Lord's work I'll go I'll go Lord I hadn't got too comfortable here I don't want to stay here no more Lord I don't want to be bound down with the Comforts of Babylon I don't want to get so comfortable that their Pleasures are running through my home and running through my life and then I get offended when those things are caught I call it out Lord let the man of God call it out and show me that rod and I staff they comfort me you love me you care for me he's gonna get those back home that are supposed to go back home there were four alias during the time of Persian rule I'm not counting you out tonight if you didn't come in the first one there was a second one come on come on there was a third one getting it come on it's not too late there was a fourth one that went up going we'll talk about this next time but come on get in this Aaliyah come on back come on back to the Homeland go all the way back God hasn't forgot you there's another Aliyah brother Branham says in this picture way down in Iran he said you read it in Luke magazine this is the last thing I'm reading how they took big planes and went down there and got plain loads of these Jews towels and something been down there since they're carrying away of Babylon they were still there [Music] been in there for 2500 years and they've been left down there they were plowing with old wooden instruments they know nothing about Jesus even being on the earth they know nothing about anything but their old Jewish Traditions Traditions that they had lived by and when these planes set down and begin to load these Jews on to take them back to the Homeland the prophet prophesied 2800 or or Thirty hundred years ago and said when they come out of that captivity God's gonna bring them forth on the wings of eagles the prophet saw that plane coming he saw them sitting down and picking them up and taking them back to the Homeland he didn't know what to call it just looked like an eagle to him so he said they'd be brought back on the wings of eagles and when they got out of that Airship and the young was helping the old and they were interviewing when they said have you come back to the Homeland to die I said no we've come to see the Messiah I just want to see Jesus I want to see Jesus in my life I want to see Jesus in evening like Chapman I'll go and see Jesus in your life go back tonight turn back to the Homeland tonight turn back to what he called you to be go back home so we can see Jesus are you just tearing here in Babylon till you die no I just want to see the Messiah I just want to see Jesus and I want everything of Babylon Stripped Away From Me in one of these mornings on the wings of an eagle I'm going home I'm going home oh I'm not staying here don't stay where you're at go home Church go home Church go home tonight don't stay in Babylon it's time to go home it's time to go home
