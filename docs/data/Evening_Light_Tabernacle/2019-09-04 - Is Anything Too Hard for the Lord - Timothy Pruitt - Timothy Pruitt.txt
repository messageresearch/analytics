that we can hear from you tonight in Jesus name Amen amen it's turning Bibles to Genesis 18 hey man it's good to be back amen to be back with you and home it's always good to go but it's always good to be back amen and though there was a lot it's amazing how things work out there was a lot going but it sounded like we still had a houseful this last weekend and we thank the Lord for that and but we were I brother Ron's there for two weekends in a row and and also spoke one week in there for him and then at the Labor Day meetings and there's some of the best meetings I've ever been in my life and just thanked the Lord for the opportunity that we had and also was with brother Shawn Martin and by the Mike walls they all send their greetings to you a man and just always good to be with God's people no matter where you go a man but I know we brother Tim and sister Karen are also coming in they may be home now but it's coming in late this evening so a man we're just glad that everyone's back home Amy are you glad to be back home a man Genesis 18 and verse 11 says now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken and aged and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore Sarah laugh within herself saying after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure my lord and being old also and the Lord say said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh say inshallah of a surety bear a child which I'm old is there anything too hard for the Lord and at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son Amen we'll let you be seated any men I'd like to speak this evening and have to bear with me a little bit of picked up a little bit of a cold over the tribe will come home with it yesterday but so if I go to snorting or something just bypass all of that Amen it's alright we're here to have church amen amen I just want to speak to you this evening on a thought the Lord it's given me on my way home yesterday is anything too hard for the Lord is anything too hard to the Lord maybe you should ask yourself that question as you think about this week or this last month or whatever you have going on in your life is anything too hard for the Lord and this thing as he said this is the words of God as he would take and he would take dust out of the earth and he would form himself a body to come and walk down him and and to angels as they came to visit Abraham under the shade tree there oh and and and as he can't begin to speak to Abraham now this is the voice of God as he began to speak and he began to give the promise to Sarah now Sarah had been sitting in the tent and she had been maybe having a hard day and going through a lot of things in her life and you know she had heard about how that Abraham was in the promise and how that a per the God was going to give Abraham a son and but here God came to show himself to her and he made this statement is anything too hard for the Lord and and this thing is actually speaking of a word or a speech or in other words is anything that I've said is it too hard for me to bring to pass if I've spoken it I can bring it to pass a man or I would not have said it and God does not say anything that he cannot do or he will not do if God spoke it he has the abilities he has the that the power or whatever it takes to bring it to pass him and this heart is actually meaning to be beyond one's power or be too difficult to do so there's nothing as he says as anything or any word that I spoke to difficult for me to bring to pass now here Abraham was sitting in the door of his tent and it was a real hot day him and it must have been you know very a lot of things going on a lot of complaints have been coming in you know from the herdsman 's and the grass was gone the land was drying up he had separated from Locke because of the water situations him and the cattle was dying and becoming very thin the water supply about gone and it found a few holes that dig a few wells and and still the cattle didn't have enough water to to drink from you know sometimes you know when things seemed to be going wrong you know we know by nature that's the darkest just before days and when things seem to be really going wrong and many times we see disastrous things happening a man we must bear it in our mind that that's when Satan is trying to block the blessing that's coming our way and I'm here to tell you that we are a blessed people we have been prophesied in this hour to be a blessed people blessed are your eyes for you see blessed for your ears that you hear amen we are a blessed people there's you know in this case was trying to tempt them to feel they had done wrong that maybe they made a wrong choice or they had done something wrong and got out of the promise of God and and here he was trying to block the own coming visitation of God that God was going to give Abraham and Sarah you know we're taught in the scriptures that all things work together for the good to them that love God and and so on no matter how bad it seems I mean remember it's working for your good that God is I'm gonna turn it somehow into a blessing God's gonna move it for your good God's gonna take a terrible thing what we deemed to be terrible what we deemed to be impossible God's going to turn it around for our good and I'm glad of that ain't man then I can have that assurance you know maybe Satan's been after your all day but I believe if he's been after it means you're about to get a blessing amen when you when you notice when the meetings are coming up or things that are happening and the special meetings you know you might as well get ready for Satan's gonna come and he's gonna try to cause disturbances he's gonna try to cause disturbance in the church or in a family or whatever he's trying to stop the blessing from getting to you he's trying to stop you from receiving something from God because he knows if that can ever come through then he's lost his power over you amen but see when when he tempts you and he tries to block he's trying what he's trying to get you to disbelieve and the worst thing you can do is disbelief God and the time that you have need of and as soon as you get a little scared maybe I've done the answer I haven't done that that's when Satan's got that blessing conquered and you can't get it as long as Satan makes you think like that he says perhaps if we would just listen to such things as temptations like that and would pay attention to them that we would miss the blessing of God and and tonight if you can get your mind on other things in your mind on a thought or a pattern or something that's going on your life that he will try to distort things into well you see as gloominess and all you see is doubt and all you see it's fear or sickness and trouble or all you see is what's not going right or what's going wrong and all you see is all these things going around you he's trying to block the blessings of God he's trying to get our mind on something else and he tries to get our mind well wait a little longer wait for another service you'll get it another day and it's always a carrot out in front of the horse so to speak but listen God isn't wanting to bring a blessing to you gods wanted to show of himself something to you that you are part of the promise of God listen it ain't just promises in the Bible but God is wanting to show you Sarah that you are part of the promise of God and it isn't just about a prophet isn't about just a preacher it isn't just about somebody else in the church but Sarah you are part of the promise of God he's wanting to bring himself in the form of a dust of a man to come and speak a word that you can see hey I'm part of the promise of God God has spoken this to me a man and he says you know sometimes when you get in a particular time and you're trying to press in and you're trying to pray or you're trying to get something from God Satan brings every kind of sticker or every kind of briar every kind of thought or every kind of thing it gives you what to keep something from happening and brother Branham said you know I mean I remember at the particular time like that he's City I go out and let him out in the wilderness somewhere to pray him he led him to a certain place it was a mill town I've had the privilege of being in that little town and seeing the house that he's speaking of in the church there and the place where it was and all that but he had been brought there because it was a lamb that had been crying it was crying out meal town and he comes to this place and he said that we searching for it and you know in our time that we live in now you can punch it in on your ways or your GPS and put in you know just say for instance cotton Valley and they're saying you've got so many minutes from here and then put out plot out but that wasn't what he had accident mill town was hardly no further than what cotton valley is from us but he didn't know where it was that and he begins to ask and finally somebody was able to point him in the direction and he goes there because he had her seen a vision or a herd of lamb crying out town and it gets there under the unction of and the inspiration of God and he goes out to pray and he says here I was trying to pray for the situation because he was holding a meeting and he was holding revivals and you know and it was a town that was a place under such oppression that they didn't believe in divine healing and they they devil was pushing against him and trying to keep him out of that town but he knew he was under divine orchestration of God to be there and so he goes out into the wilderness and the country that had a praying as he's pray and he says the sticker starts sticking him and the Brier start biting on and mosquitoes start buzzing him you know and he starts swatting at them and he starts thinking about the stickers and he just says Lord I need your help and a sticker poke him lord I need your help and a mosquito bite him he said he didn't know I had to get to the point then I didn't worry no more about a mosquito I didn't worry no more about a sticker I was here to hear from God and I was going to hear from God and I began to pray and I begin to pray harder the more the sticker stuck the harder I pray the more than mosquito bit the harder I prayed he said I didn't care to the mosquito bit he could just fill up if he wanted to I wasn't concerned about him no more I was there for one reason if we can get that singleness of mind tonight the word the heart of the devil pushes the harder I'm going to pray the harder he comes against me the heart I'm going to pray I'm going to get something from God and if you come with that expectation in that at an auction in your heart that I'm not leaving here without hearing from God God will talk to you God will speak to you and as he pushed into that now here God was determined what was he determined he was determined to sent one lamb free and this lamb was caught in a and a tangle of unbelief the church didn't believe mom and daddy didn't believe it was caught in a thicket of unbelief but God was determined he was going to save that lamb I'm thankful to serve a God that's determined like that because I once was lost but now I'm found I once was blind but now I see why because God is so determined to save what is his you know we just had the privilege of watching the the plate Jesus at the sight and sound or a trip and that one thing that really struck me was how they played out the maniac of gaturro and as Jesus went across the sea and he's going and the storms are rocking and rolling and you see the maniac up in the bushes there and he's getting all tore up and the demons of torment are there and but Jesus was so determined and he would leave a crowd and go to one and as he's going across they played it out as Jesus would tell the parable about leaving the ninety-nine and go after that one lost lamb hallelujah I'm glad I serve a card like that that God has determined to meet the month the smallest of needs are the smallest of places got to go through hell to get there he don't care what it takes if that's his lamb he's going after it amen and Jesus steps out of the boat and he begins to walk up out up there and the man has begin to be tormented by the spirits and the voice and he says what's your name and Legion speaks out the demons it was like a voice I never thought about this but you know Legion being many it was many voices that spoke out of this man and Jesus said I'm not speaking to you I'm speaking to this man hallelujah he says Dorian that's what the name that guy I never thought about Legion having a name but God knows your name and the devil might want to give you a different name but God knows your real name Amen in here this little girl the devil to try to put tuberculosis on her and not what she was known by was unbelief in tuberculosis but God knew her name hallelujah and I want to hear you tell you tonight God knows your name he knows exactly the situation you find yourself in he knows exactly the tormenting spirits that's been upon you and he's not going to talk to them he's talking to you tonight and he's saying is there anything too hard for the Lord listen if he can go across the raging sea and save one he can come in the service on a Wednesday night and set the captive free he can come in the service on a Wednesday night and said he'll never sick person among us he's that kind of car is anything too hard for the Lord hey man but here she was a little girl could hardly spit in a cup 35 pounds her legs just about so big he says thinner than Florence Nightingale so I've seen pictures of her there's anything too hard to the Lord for the Lord said he'd been a revival for two weeks coming to the church said it was there said something begin to press go up in the wilderness of praying he said when anything presses like that you do it because it's the Holy Spirit and mrs. Wright said Billy I'll ring the old country dinner bound for you in his times and I ring that when it's suppers ready for you to come then when you come and eat we'll go right to church I said all right he goes out there and he says you know as I got there the rocks started poking me the stickers started poking me the mosquitoes started buzzing he said you know the devil is just trying to keep you from getting the blessing hey man I wonder how many blessings we've been robbed out of in a service because we allowed the voice of Satan or the torment and thing I'm saying to become greater than pressing our way into the kingdom of God and he said what it was the devil's trying to keep you from getting the blessing and I climbed a little further into the thicket and knelt down mosquitos was there and I was like oh God be merciful and I threw up my hands and prayed anyhow and then as I begin to get so burdened in my heart and pray and pray I become so lost in prayer he said I don't hope you Christians know what that means that's praying in the spirit and he said I opened my eyes and it was a little light hanging there and said rise and go by the way of Carters hallelujah is that he walked in there there's this little girl it's laying there seemed impossible for an impossible situation but he said rise in the name of Jesus and you're healed he said I don't even know why I said it it just come out of my mouth before I could even think about rise in the name of Jesus and be healed he said is there anything too hard for the Lord and he said that she rose up out of there and began to march all over the and bless the grass and bless the trees and scream and shout and father came home an unbeliever unbelieving father came heard all the noise began running in then there's this daughter sitting there playing there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins with sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty sayings he said her name is Georgie Carter CAA rter milk town into Hana ride her if you'd like to know the testimony for yourself Amen I was preaching this about her one time up and up in Ohio and her sister brought me a picture of her sitting there a man on her seat there she was a caretaker in Georgia Carter later years and when I looked at that picture and behind there was a little plaque that said I believe in the power of a Living God Amen why is anything too hard for the Lord well what happened Satan is trying to block you from receiving something from him so it's in little things that gets you in sin things right before service you'll send things in your car on the way to church they try to block you from receiving something from God but you got a pushback against those things [Music] [Applause] but one way in the middle of our storm we must never forget who he is a storm or struggle or a situation that seems to be complete chaos it's just Satan trying to block us from a promise trying to get us to a place we can't receive something from God and missing altogether sickness comes troubles at the door trials on ever hand chaos all around the suppression of Satan but ask the question again is anything too hard for the Lord maybe about your husband's situation you did ask is anything too hard for the Lord for your children out there is anything too hard for the Lord for the sickness that's in your body as it cultures it's anything too hard for the Lord is any sickness too hard for the Lord it's any sin too hard for the Lord it's any heart heart too hard for the Lord it's financial struggle too hard for the Lord it's pain anything is anything too hard for the Lord is anything too hard for the Lord listen there's no promise too hard for him to keep there's no prayer too hard for him to answer there's no problem too hard for him to solve there's no person too hard for him to save he heals the worst cases he saved the worst sinners come on y'all act like I'm talking about a ball song I'm talking about the name above all names I'm talking about your God your Savior your healer your everything that's who I'm talking about they saves the worst cases he heals the worst sin it says sickness he softens the hardest hearts he made a way where there seems to be no way here's a pain taker here's a waymaker he is a promise keeper I'm talking about the god of gods what was it to Abraham and Sarah it was the force of God he meant what was it it was a trumpet that blasted the promises also for you Sarah a man have you ever had the voice of God speak to you I've had to speak to me might have been in the form of some dust but when you heard that voice it might have come out of a friend or out of that may come from heaven I don't know but I've heard that voice hey man you know we think this was beats of all this would be some kind of ha just euphoria of a wonderful meeting no this is three men walking out of the dust just common visitors out on the plains there come walking out of the desert but Abraham saw something a little different about them he heard the voice and he realized hey this is the same one that's been talking to me but Sarah's in a tent there and she's all stood up like yeah well this is really a good day for some company to show up you know and she's all kind of a tore up mood and things and if she wasn't careful she was going to miss it but she was ordained to carry her promised child so the devil could do whatever he want to but he couldn't keep the promise from being fulfilled and God came and spoke and he said Sarah I've had that voice speak to me and he almost leaves you're like ringing in your ears for a moment in the whole world just for a moment just goes quiet and all you can hear is that voice a man that is the voice of God it's a trumpet blasted amen and ever end the one that when the voice of God is a thunder or a trumpet it's a sounding that goes for amen not a whisper it's a blast Satan doing everything he could to block it but that blast going through the doubt and the fear and the unbelief and could it be me Sam you're going to have a child hallelujah amen that same voices here tonight saying Sarah the promise is up to you it's your promise it ain't just somebody else on up you it's your promise stood up eyes on the wrong things but God's words gonna be fulfilled and when the Word of God sounds out in your life it will cause a war and when the trumpet is a sounding for war a man it's the voice of God sounding for war that's what the Jubilee trumpet was in and you know forty-nine years but on the fiftieth year they could go free it was a sounding of the trumpet it was a sound of freedom it was a blast that went across the country and the begin to sound out it as it entered into the years if they don't accept it for what it was they could go free amen if they would hear it with their ears they could throw their hose down they can do anything that the plow another Road they didn't have to live another moment in slavery they didn't have to do not one more thing for that for that slave master they could walk away a free man because it was a blast that took forward a trumpet that sounded and when that trumpet sounded there wasn't anything too hard for the Lord there wasn't no situation too hard for the Lord unless it would be unbelief the sounding of a trumpet the gospel trumpet it means get ready for scriptural war this is in the signs of the answer scripture war Paul said if you want to put this down first Corinthians 48 14:8 said if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound how will a man know what to prepare for if it doesn't give a scriptural sound a vindicated sound the Word of God Manifest how we how would we know he said if it says they believe in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and there forever but then they denies signs and wonders that the whole realm of nature bleed on him and all the churches bleed on by this how would we know how to prepare he said somebody has come forth with a chart and drawed it out out somebody's coming down another thing contrary that and there's so many voices but when God sounds it will be a scriptural war it'll take you back to the scriptures for you to have something to hold on to amen it'll be scripturally right it'll be listen this message is they you know people say what brother branham said this and brother Branham said this this is the message of what the message is is what the Bible says amen him even if brother Branham said it if you don't take it back to the Bible then it's not a scriptural war but listen brother Branham didn't have to come and rewrite another book he brought us back to the Bible and he put us in our homeland and said these are your boundaries and when you see the devil coming in on your boundary prepare for war don't let him stay there I don't know I think we've allowed the devil to encroach on our freedoms for too long and we've allowed him to come into our homes into our houses listen if you'll eat the book it'll prepare you to war with the devil and take back your promises your god-given right you know what your god-given right as a woman is to be a godly woman that's a god-given right you know if you want to paint yourself up and look like a Jezebel that's not a god-given right that's not a scriptural battle a scripture when you bring it back to the scripture to declare war on your closet hey man you boys to it a declare war on your hairstyles and you and your closet and everything that you got going on your phones a man in a declare war on everything hey man that's what this list what this jubilee trumpet is this jubilee trumpet wasn't for you to remain in slavery this message is not slavery this message is freedom it's the greatest freedom to ever hit this world amen it's the greatest sounding that ever hit this world since the death of Jesus Christ this message sounded out of Jubilee Amen to bring us into a scriptural warfare to where we know who we're fighting and what we're fighting for amen this message is not I cast my boundaries and binding this it is our freedom I don't get it I mean people say well I I'm in the battle for the Lord yet they still got paint on their faces they still wearing ungodly things how many started reading that book on the dress brother Tim gave out any man listen it's a scriptural war that's going on listen there he said but when God comes in the power of his resurrection who's going to speak against it when God comes and vindicates a word who's going to speak against they said of Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever then he does the same signs that he did yesterday today and forever that's what this angel is talking about the last angel seven things you're supposed to do take the mysteries and blue sins and that run people out and run people out on if it gives an uncertain sound unscriptural who can prepare himself a trumpet did you notice each one of those ages I told you the church coming in when that trumpet sound of the seer of seal tore loose a trumpet means war it don't if it don't give a scriptural sound that about it but let me call this to you member each church age had his message and his messenger Paul was the first messenger and when that trumpet sounded the first seal tore loose Paul the first message he found what did he do he declared war on that Orthodox Church hey man is anything to the heart for the Lord and when he was having to go down into their dance and give their lives up for this gospel is anything too hard for the Lord but God gave them a power Paul knowing the Scriptures knowing Jesus was the Messiah blasted those synagogues from place to place with scriptures and he put out le he's put out of every one of them till finally he had to shake the dust from his feet and turn to the Gentile what was it it was a sound of a trumpet standing there with the word don't you miss that the word standing with the word the gospel trumpet hallelujah amen if you wanted to really want to win in this battle the only place you're gonna win is standing with the word Hanabi that's the only place of safety in my day might cost them their lives as far as naturally speaking and it was hung there was crucified but yet today they are in victory why because they stood with the world is anything too hard for the Lord go down to Iranians the next Church age st. Martin the next one Saint Martin blasted his aides Luther's blast of the church's classic Church with the word of God the just shall live by faith and this is not the literal body of Christ and he through the communion on the floor and walked out and blessed in that Catholic Church what was it it was a trumpet that was sounding that everyone could go free hallelujah and it was many that walked out of them catechisms and in dark places of Catholicism free man the just shall live by faith why because there's anything too hard for the Lord God will have victorious lives in every age or therefore he would not have spoken to him that overcometh and every age he said to him that overcometh he couldn't put that in there unless there was an overcomer to me had he spoken in palsies he spoken in i radiuses and he said a trumpet a voice of God it was to prepare them for scriptural battles and scriptures Lord to fight an army and the enemy that was going to try to press and press and press but God sent something to combat him with hey man we can see the pail the horse riders as they took forth a man a man with all the the white horse and the black horse or the red horse of black horse all the way down to the pail and it's beginning to ride not in this full force until thankfully we're out of here but in every one of them God sent an antidote or he said a warring ain't meant an opposition to uh to come in opposition listen we're not in this battle alone hallelujah I want you to understand you're not standing or sitting here in this period of law you're not here by yourself we have not left here alone to stand on her home but here sit of spirit here to defeat this enemy I don't know he sent them he sent down the line in the ox and the mayor and in this age we know what we have we the Eagle he's calling to battle John Wesley raised up said why they said why there's no need to have revivals John Wesley stood up with a message of the work of grace sanctification he blessed that Anglican Church with the gospel trumpet prepared for war he did it he says now we're in the Laodicean age when they've done once again denominated Methodists has went and Baptist Presbyterian Luther Pentecostals they're looking for a prophet to come to blast this age that turned them back from their iniquity he said if they had been the trend all the way down to the age where God changed his trend today no he can't do it amen he has to keep into the regular stride what was this message as a gospel trumpet blasting out of Jubilee showing us time and time again there's nothing too hard for the Lord hallelujah and let me tell you this trumpet didn't stop this gospel sounding didn't stop fifty years ago it's still sounding today that he's still the same yesterday today and forever he's still the angel God that visited people service after service after service he's still the pillar of fire mongers hallelujah even this past weekend there was it was several people that come back and testify of the pillar of fire that was among us Amen actually it was a little boy that walked out of the out of the church he's nothing what's at five years old something like that walked out and his dad hadn't heard nothing yet about what he went and went on it was the first night of the service on Sunday brother Andrew got up and said he had gotten several texts about the pillar fire being visible says brother came to brother Andrew and told him said you know he said Friday night my five year old boy was walking out going to our car and he says daddy he said that's a scary church he said well what do you what do you mean scary he said did you not see that fire over that man while he was preaching he said it was going up and it was going into the rafters and coming down he said that's a scary Church I want you to understand this is a scary Church a man is so scary the devil can't stay here with his cancer he can't stay here with his alopecia he can't stay here with his brain bleeds he can't stay here with us he'll troubles he can't stay here in the center sit there without conviction falling upon the heart this is a scary church not because of some man or some man's ideas or some pre it's because of the visible visitation of the angels of God is there anything too hard for the Lord I remember I can't remember what situation it was was face and I believe it was with my mother and I sent a text to her brother in Tennessee and he sitting around with his family and his boys actually kind of being on the fence just not knowing exactly who he is yet you know and he was telling his telling his family as they went to devotions he's told him with the situation and his boy just kind of smiled he said that devil showed up at the wrong church hey man I believe we're that kind of church I like being that kind of church on the devil walks in wrong Church wrong place wrong crowd wrong place I I don't have know the kingdom of this world has come and he has no part with me Honolulu that's the kind of church I want to be then when he comes in he realize I am in the wrong place these people believe these people know my god and they won't do exploits I am not welcome here is there anything too hard for the Lord when that Jubilee trumpet sounded every slave could take a slave belt off and walk off the job he didn't have to hold no more he didn't have to weed no more he didn't have to do one more minute with the devil done over with st. Andrew is over and when this trumpet sounded in our age it was to notify the devil your rule is over you are done you have no more Dominion you have lost your power hallelujah is there people here tonight I want to notify the devil I've heard the Jubilee trumpet and I want him to know your rule is over your dumb devil I'm not listening to another one of your lies I'm not listening to more your torment experience I'm not listen to your depression I will have the joy of God in my heart [Applause] it is a sound for scripture war and I'm looking at a scriptural people the people of the park [Applause] lalu God proved over and over there is nothing too hard for him mercy how many accounts that we have to take from the Bible to show us over and over there's nothing too hard wall a sea of red sea big deal and walk cross on dry land no food no problem here it is no water no problem here it is hey man Alleluia let's look at another one here he said here let me go down for just saying the scripture comes to my mind I thought I had it right place but I want to bring it right now in Joshua is there anything too hard for the Lord John 6:15 and here they are they've done seeing time after time they didn't come through fifty years forty years many years of walking through the wilderness they wondered forty but there was also coming through wilderness before that so how many years they had seen God provide time after time after time and here they were given the instruction by the mighty angels he came down and he with a sword drawn we know the story and he told jobs for the battle-plan and what was it it was a strumpet it was a voice that was sounding for spiritual war for scriptural war and Joshua 6 and verse 15 it said it came to pass on the seventh day seventh age to get me the Liberty and they rose earlier about the dawning of the day and compassed the city after the same manner seven times only in that day they can pass the city seven times and it came to pass at the seventh time when the priests blew the trumpets just was said unto people shout for the Lord has given you the city and it came to pass of the seven times and the priests blew the trumpets what was that it was called for war and he said shout for the Lord have given you the city and the city shall be cursed and all that there into the Lord only Rahab the harlot shall live she and all that's in her house hallelujah and this moment he has called us to this place to this age that we're living in and he's telling you I've given you the promise I've given you the land I'm giving you everything that you have need of all you gotta do a shout receive what I give in here Amen it's a jubilee trumpet that is sounded you don't have to remain a slave no longer I provided for your needs I provided for your food I provided for everything that you are I have everything you ever have is he anything too hard for the Lord hallelujah I preached that Saturday night on the sound of freedom the sermon the Lord gave me just a few moments while I walked out of this door I preached this Saturday night where the Andrew came up and he said there was a brother a man that come as a few weeks before and preached along the same lines he said the Lord spoke and he said for them to tell them this you need to start letting your noise or your sound match your miracle hallelujah when you realize what the Lord has done for you where he's brought you from and it brought you out of slavery and it brought you out of all kind of thing I don't see it in depression it's spirits of Hell that huh come on Legion he brought you out of all he said leader I'm not talking to you I'm calling you by I'm calling about Joe Aaron Timothy everything that's been written there that's who you really are hallelujah and if you know God's healed you God saved you God set you free it's time we let our rejoicing loose a man what happened as they begin to shout and praise God they called for scrip spiritual war and angels captains of hope and they begin to push down the walls and push down down they push down up early they push down here and push down sickness and push down cancer alopecia fell over bravely Trillo and the children of Israel running through their free man they was a slave the longer now they were the victors [Applause] this is what he has brought you to this is the sound another trumpet and one day that Trump is gonna sound so loud the dead cries gonna walk among us [Applause] hello praise God this is calling us to a scriptural war it isn't a physical battle it's a spiritual battle that's why Satan don't stand there as a physical enemy poke you know how angry you would get really fast and somebody some wicked looking dude come sat down beside you and starting this ain't your service stop that you're not going nowhere who do you think you how long you gonna put up with that but yet the devil comes along puts all kinds of things and starts poking things hitting for you the service ain't for you is for you is for somebody else you don't even belong here you're in the wrong spot poke poke poke poke how long we gonna put up with it [Applause] hey man it's like I told my mother that I hear while back when she was going through the situation that she was having with the overreaction to the medicines and things and was causing her some issues I said mom i sat down beside her and said mom you're gonna have to fight I said it ain't a physical fight you can't punch him with your fat you're gonna be fists as much as I know you'd love to or I'd love to right now I'd love to punch that devil right in the mouth I said but you're going to fight you can't lay around and your wowsie wowsie was you can't lay around depressed you've got to start speaking the word I said let me ask you something I said how long would you lay there in bed if there was a man walked in this house and started dragging your little granddaughter out the door no no honey I know I know what you do you'd grab whatever you can grab and you start beating with everything you got a beat and I said you're gonna have to do the same thing to that spirit that's coming against your mind say this thing where I'm not entertaining you you get out of here I said I can't do it for your dad can't do it for you got to do it for yourself you guys I am not entertaining you know more let's something rise up on the inside of her and all of a sudden it came over her and she began to scream out I ain't gonna listen to you one more time devil I ain't gonna listen to hear no more I'm walking I won't be a free woman and listen that's something that you got to do in the service you didn't tell the devil I'm not listening to you and this is my service this is my time Healing is out the door I wonder how many times he comes our door and he knocks and he said whosoever will let him open up you have something to do well Brandon would talk about this in the contest he said our contest is not a physical contest as a spiritual contest spiritual wickedness in high places and he reads it there out of Ephesians and we spent some time on that a while back on the fees and six when we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places and I thought it was very interesting how he started that sermon out he said spiritual wickedness in high places she said I'd like to speak to you on a contest and he said a contest is a test of strength he said we have to tell and we are here to test strength and he said the Indians used to build a fire and it puts so many men on one end of a rope and so many men on the other end it'd be a tug of war it was a contest of strength who will pull the losing party across the fire he said now we know there's many things he said we could talk about he said would be said about a contest he said but this contest I want to talk about is between the church and Satan now notice he didn't say Jesus and say he said the church and Satan the great strength of the church and they don't want to speak about the great strength of God or the great seats of the great strength of Satan and then we want to speak about the great strength of God in his church so you're not fighting this battle alone I want you to understand you're not the only one that's got a hold of the road is there anything too hard for the Lord but he's gonna let you pull it around wrestle it out and you're gonna wrestle with it as Jacob wrestled with it as many have wrestled down to the ages were saying he said we know but we know when Satan is trying now to pull God's people across the fire we know who has the most power God does and God when He gave the people the best thing he could combat Satan with his word and the Word of God who is stronger than God is anything too hard for the Lord the Word of God and the word becomes our strength God in the church it becomes a straight to pull Satan into his own fire hallelujah even every service you come to you have the obligation to grab ahold of the Rope so I'm going to pull with everything I've got because it's me are you devil hey man he said he said those saying he says people says he said people don't believe in demons in this day some of the thing to do is to know your enemy to train to know exactly where the punch is going to come from and how to punch him he says he tries to study us and he's been studying for 6,000 years he studies his legs licks he knows what he's fighting for whether he leans forward hangs back checks and if his left hand or right hand he studies all of that he tries to find him a sparring partner the fight just like it was a bonus fight he said the thing that's very good for Christians to do is to know where you want to start training and he start with John 3:16 for God so loved the world you need to tell that devil and that God loves me won't you to turn around to your neighbor and tell your neighbor God loves me and God loves you hey man that right there wouldn't already start the licks and on Satan because Satan always wanting to come to you and said nobody cares nobody understands nobody knows nobody's worried about you you're on your own nobody care just you're by yourself God so loved the world God makes us he says God could think of what he could give for his people to defeat the enemy if he could thought of anything better he would have done it but he gave to the people his word said now the enemy is gonna study he's gonna try to find it find that wheat pump moment like he did Eve and once he it's the word it's the word the line is the word and Satan's on the other end trying to pull you with the word that's what he did he pulled her out of Eden with the word he come and he tried to pull with the deceit he tried to do it to Jesus he used the word against Jesus to try to pull them out of their position looks so good look so in it looks so right but it wasn't scriptural you always got to take him back to the word and you'll realize when you take him back to the word he left something out it's 99% the truth but that's he said wouldn't it but he said what happens he tries to bring the word and reason it yet God has said you are but not for this time yeah you can be healed but not this service and every time he's pulling you closer to the fire you you're you're one of his but it's gonna not just wait a little longer it's not right now and he's pulling trying to pull you to destruction he said well what is it it's a contest and what you have to do is get away from all unbelief all doubts and get back to John 3:16 God so loved the world he loves me he said see Satan didn't to disagree with her when she quoted the word God said you gonna eat there of that day you eat there they waiting he didn't disagree he said certainly that's right but you see you need some new light need something a little different from what God said if you do you'll be a little smarter what was he doing pulling there ever so closely to himself he said this even seeing but God said you would you would die that settles it that broke that great tug-of-war broke loose the whole human race to death because Eve listened to the reason of against God's Word and he said every time you do it it'll pull you into the fire he said so you know men he said today there's no such a thing as a devil that that was just a bad thought now we're at this church know better than that he's more than just a bad thought but so is God more than just a good thought Honolulu yeah we didn't the Bible says but the Holy Spirit he the Holy Spirit has come he personal program he's something real and the devil is a person demons are a person he said a man was arguing me a few weeks ago you know what I did do you just be just put something in people's mind thinking that you're telling them a thing and it just changes of the thought he said I met the very same thing in India one time those holy men that were there and I believe the largest hearted to ever stood before me half a million people caught it by discernment of the spirit of why this man was blind he said this big force he said this tug of war was going on he's just reading their minds but he said I knew I wasn't reading his mind he said knew I'd seen a vision and the vision had told me why this man was blind brother Branham puts out the challenge he said hey you ready you wise men a holy man you think that like that said this man became blind because he was looking at the Sun and worshiping the Sun he said now if you by the power that you believe in you come in healing and he said that not up one of them came up he said but what was going on it was a tug of war there's a tug award in every service will I get anything this service will I received something from God am I gonna get something and Satan's like no not this time just wait a little longer yeah you are child of God just wait a little longer yeah you're you're you're an overcomer just wait a little longer and he said as he stood there you know some people today when they bring this down some people today are trying to say that Jesus ain't the word we're supposed to use we're supposed to use Yahweh or Yeshua it's a bunch of nonsense I'd rather use the word that was vindicated in this hour Jesus I'd rather use the name that the word the word the name that the squirrels were created in the name that blind eyes see the name that healed the Deaf and healed the lepers and raised the dead that's the name I'm going to use hey man I'm not gonna follow some other thing that's that ain't even been de cated but I know that names vindicated and that's what he did he said I come here not in my own name he said but I come in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he said by that power and he said what is it it's actually a power God is God Satan is God if you don't believe in the devil just wait a little bit he said don't tell me there's no devil because I know better I fight him every day and he fights him every day so I know there's a devil he said he must be trained when you meet him not trained with psychology or trained with education but trained by the Holy Spirit God's power in his word to make it manifest know your enemy but as I stood there I said it's got to happen because Jesus said it's going to happen so I stood there beyond the reasoning beyond the mind battles beyond the tug-of-war and I grabbed the line and I said in the name of Jesus let this man receiveth saying and that pull pulled that man into his healing let's go to Ezekiel 36 is anything too hard for the Lord I'm just reading this and just so struck me said also thou son of man prophesy into the mountains of Israel and say mountains of Israel hear the word of the Lord thus saith the Lord God because the enemy has said against you AHA even the high ancient high places are ours in position therefore prophesy and say thus saith the Lord God now notice what he's talking to his tongue to the hills the mountains the valleys the promised land the promises and the enemy had garish them their self around the promises and said we're gonna take these high places they belong to us but a word came to him said thus saith the Lord because they made you desolate and swallowed you up on every side that you might be a possession unto the residue of the healing heathen and you've taken up the lips and you're taking up in the lips of the talkers and are an infamy of the people therefore your mountains of Israel hear the word of the Lord thus saith the Lord God to the mountains to the hills to the rivers to the valleys to the desolate wasters to the cities that are forsaken which become a prey and arisen to the residue of the healing that heathen that are roundabout therefore thus saith the Lord God surely in the fire my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen and it gets all into me and whichever poured in my land into the possession with a joy of all the heart with the spiteful minds to cast it out for a pray prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel and say to the mountains to the hills to the rivers to the valleys thus saith the Lord behold I'm spoken to my jealousy and in my fury because I'll born the shame of the healing dust saith the LORD of how many times he said I'm speaking here I've lifted up my hands surely they even that are about you they shall bear their shame but ye o mountains of Israel ye promises you words of God you shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to my people to my people of Israel for they are at hand to come Oh hallelujah you didn't tell your prayer promise I'm at hand I'm at hand I'm here to receive what is mine is anything too hard to the Lord it may look like that promises went for years and years and Garrison's of enemy but the Lord has spoken you're gonna bring forth fruit you're gonna bring it in my people you're gonna do what I have said you're gonna do for who you're gonna do it for for I have spoken saith the Lord for behold I am with you hello somebody a man he just said the fruit to my people for I am for you and I will turn unto you and ye shall be tilled and sown and I will multiply me and upon you all the house of Israel even all of it in the city shall be inhabited and the way shall be builded and I won't multiply upon you men and beasts and they shall increase and bring forth fruit and I will settle you after your oldest States and will do better unto you than at your beginnings come on job better at you then what happens at your beginnings hey brothers brother Danny said before we left quit looking at what's going on in the middle and look to the end the promises of God and realized God's gonna do better for me daddy did at the beginning he's gonna give me streets of gold to walk on he's gonna give me a body that's never sinned and no doubts no worries no fears no ever he's gonna give me more than I ever had thus saith the Lord God I will cause men and I you shall know that i am the lord verse 12 then I will cause men to walk upon you hallelujah he's built promises he's been laying there for us to walk on even my people Israel they shall possess thee and thou shalt be their inheritance thou shalt no more henceforth burry them of men thus saith the LORD because they say unto you now land the divine sup men and has breathed that nation therefore they shout to our men know or need to believe that nations anymore sent the Lord God neither when I calls me into hearing the the shame of the heathen anymore neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people anymore neither shalt thou cause I nation to fall anymore saith the Lord God moreover the word of the Lord came to me saying son of man when the house of Israel dwelt in their land they defiled it by their own way and by their doings their way was before me as uncleanness of a removed woman wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood which had shed upon the land and for the idols wherewith they had polluted it and I scattered them among the heathen they were dispersed through the countries according their way according to their doings I judge them and when they entered to the heathen whether they went they profaned my holy name and said these are the people the Lord are going out of the land but I had pity for my Holy Name which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen whether they win therefore saying to the house of Israel thus saith the Lord I do not this for your sake so house of Israel but for my holy name sakes which you have profaned among the heathens whether they win I will sanctify my great name I wish you profaned among the heathen you profaned in the midst of them and he that shall know that I am the Lord said the Lord God when I shall sanctify in you before their eyes yes you went out yes you did wrong but I'm gonna bring you home again I'm gonna sanctify you right before the heathens eyes I've gotta change your body right before the heathens eyes and I will take you from among the heathen and gather out of all the countries or bring you into your own land then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean and from all your filthiness and from all your idols will I cleanse you can somebody say Amazing Grace a new heart also would I give you a new spirit where I put within you and I'll take away the stony heart is anything too hard for the Lord a stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh and I'll put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them and you should dwell in the land that I gave your father's and you shall be my people and I will be your God and I will save you from all your own cleanliness and I will call for the corn and will increase it and let no famine upon you I will multiply the fruit of the tree increase of the field and you shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen then you shall remember your own evil ways and your doings that were not good and shall loathe yourself in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations not for your sakes do I do this saith the Lord be it known unto you be ashamed and compounded for your own ways o house of Israel thus says the Lord in the day that I shall cleanse you from all your iniquity I will also cause you to dwell in cities and wasted places shall be built up and desolate land shall be tilled and laid desolate in the sight of all the paths and they shall say this land that was desolate it's become like a Garden of Eden these promises that have laid dormant are now blossoming blossom ahead people are eating the fruit of them they lay dormant for thousands of years the Holy Ghost lay the promise of that power to give somebody the overcoming power lay dormant for so many years but one day a trumpet sounds voice spoke and it caused the scriptural war and man that had left and become as desolate wasteland barren deserts some of you heat some such for some of you barren places the enemy had camped out on you said you'll never be anything said you never belong to you never did belong to God made all kind of haunts and challenges but there was a trumpet this sounded and you heard it you said he said I can go free is there anything too hard for the Lord is there any case too hard for him how much have we seen it would be a bit sin for us to doubt now God has given us so many
