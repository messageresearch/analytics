the spirit of Truth in the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him not for ye know him for he dwelleth in you and shall be in you and I will not leave you comfortless but I will come to you amen this word comforter is translated also as helper or an advocate it means someone who is some or called to your side and he's called there in order to help someone who pleads another calls before judge it's a an advocate is a legal assistant or intercessor Amen brother R would say it like this said Christ took me in and now I am his child look what he has done for us he in his riches became poor in his poverty he became poverty that we might become rich in his immortality he became flesh that he might take on our sicknesses that in his sickness we might have health he who was sinless my sin that I might become sin he may he became me that I might become him amen he took my place amen he took my call here he stands as your my and your representative and when God looks at us he does not see us he sees who is representing us he sees Christ who is standing in our representing us before the father amen I'm thankful in this that we have a promise he will never

might be made rich rich in what money no rich in Heavenly blessed rich in spiritual we who once poor have become rich of he stripped himself he humiliated himself and he came down and dwelt in a body of humili he brought himself down and he humbled himself for the body of walk among men amen he in the curse bearing the pain amen going through death itself but it was love that he did all of that he was sick you say well he was he sick surely he he certainly was he said even in his own statement don't they say to me physician heal yourself see he bore our B our grief bore our sin amen he is acquainted with our Humanity he didn't know what it was like to be a human but God came down down from his glory living story became flesh he took on human batt he knows what it's like to Ste with the pressures that you deal with issues that you have because he became you why so you can become him if you had committed a crime and you was going to be taken before the court and you knew that if you were found guilty you were going to die Maybe by electric chair or gas amen whatever you was going to die if if you don't find somebody that can represent your case you would want to get the best attorney you could find you would want to get the best one who knew the law who knew how to organize your case but even if you found the best one there would be still a question whether this attorney can change judge's [Music] mind or could change the jury's mind you wonder if this attorney with this ability to speak and KN all the laws complete your case so you could live yet in all of his authority his great speech The Impressions he can make and upon the enough could he make a case would he be able to win it be able to live amen but in this case the judge is your amen God became man there was no attorney could do it there was no man that there was no man worthy to take but the judge took your the judge your attor and he is now standing hallelujah hallelujah he became both judge jury and attorney he pleaded your case we were found guilty every of we worthy to die we W worthy to go down but he took our case hallelujah hallelujah and he became the judge he became the jury and he became the attorney case is dismissed hallelujah hallelujah there is no more sin to the believer God has extended his Mercy oh there is a case but the case has been dismissed hallelujah hallelujah aren't you thankful the case hallelujah hallelujah you're not depending on your own merits your what you can do how you can do what words you can speak what I can say I do has already done H he's already paid the price he's already pleaded my the price is already paid hallelujah hallelujah God came down and he took on sin Amen in in the Old Testament they would have they would offer a lamb and this lamb would be offered up but it was only a covering of the sin the sin was still there it was only a covering because the life of that wly lamb could not come back into the believer let me borrow your napkin there I'm sorry so they would offer a they would offer a sacrifice and it would just come down and it would cover it would cover the sin but the sin was still there David would commit adultery and he would say create in me a clean heart oh God spirit away he all these desires he would have but he was still there he would put the word on his bed post and he everything could to keep a righteous heart but it was still there amen the spirit would come down and it would go back up it would come down and he would go back up he would become anointed write many songs defeat Goliath under the anointing of the Holy Ghost not indwell because the blood of the Lamb had not been sh but Jesus came down the river of Jo and the Spirit came for the first time indwelt inside of amen and when this was it wasn't just a covering it didn't just cover itated it dismissed and the life of that lamb now coming to the believer and he can live an overcoming life he can live he his fear his his because it wasn't his life it was a token that had been applied amen he had come and paid the price there is a token you can obtain amen there's a way that has been made the father himself became one us that is the real lamb that is the purpose he had in his mind that is the reason the lamb was so the testifying of another lamb to come that the token can be applied that we're no more aliens strangers we're Sons and Daughters of God Amen that's what we said last night this meeting is not about whether we're American or european whatever we are here that's not what this is about we are no more aliens No More Strangers Sons it's not about being a PR or being a May it's about being a son or daughter of [Applause] God a different bloodline amen amen it's a different bloodline amen it can't perish now there's a different life that's taken over it's a token Hallelujah this token lays over the body lay over amen the token the holy when I see the token I'll pass over you it's the intercessor it's the advocate the Holy Spirit laying over you You Can't Touch This one belongs to [Music] me price has already you can't have this I've already bought it Hallelujah so a token it means

many kings here in that had many riches where is it at today gone just a few buildings to represent what they used to be how they used to live we're not serving a god what he used to heal because our God is not limited he's not limited by time not limited by limited by any of United if you have a need just give you a personal testimony just this year I was in a real real crunch financially I'll back up a few years I you know I I started ministering around year 2000 and uh honestly I didn't want to be a preacher I actually fought against it my poor wife had to deal with it for a while didn't want to read the Bible because I read the Bible then I saw something close it put it back my dad you know he would he wouldn't never let anybody ask me if I would be a preacher he said don't ask him that he said because it ain't man that makes a preacher he said because of man call then man has to take care of it but he said if God call God take care amen and so you know a few years ago I was looking to maybe get into some business try to make some extra money because beyond what some people think you don't get rich being a preacher amen so I I I was looking to do that and so I had these plans went to brother Ron Spencer for a meeting ate lunch with him one day night I would come and he was look at and brother brother Ron I don't if you know him he's a real spiritual man and he just kind of popped me on the shoulder say it's going to be a wonderful weekend especially for you I like wow wow yeah so I preach that night the next day we would go up on the mountain I had not spoke one word about this thought of being in business with some over he said this is the place right here he said the Lord spoke to me yesterday he said after you left after we ate I went to my room to he said I couldn't sleep so I got up said the Lord began to speak to me he said you tell Timothy don't go into business my I'll take care hallelujah hallelujah was it what my flesh wanted to hear no no no no but my spirit said Thank You Lord you knew what I was about to do you saved me from a lot of things begin to move very good years things this year come around things begin to get tight it's easy to praise God on a [Music] mountain but when you get in the valley get P toet who you really are amen amen sitting in here with your hands up that don't just that really don't determine who you really are what determines who you really are is when you're by yourself there's nobody else around and it seems like all something Rises up [Music] me come one Sunday and all weekend I just been crying out to the Lord Lord I don't know how this is going to work and so I led the singing on Sunday morning would go back to the office it justs on the floor said Lord help me stay where you called me to don't let me even flinch just stay the I know you can take care of me so many times and you'll do it again well the next morning my wife and and a daughter-in-law maybe went for a walk she comes back she goes by the mailbox out the mail she brings it in hands me this card and I open it up and I begin to read says thank you for every encouraging word all the things you have meant to us in our family take this offering as a gift and do as it with it as you would need for my hearts to yours flipped over the check it wasn't just enough it was more than enough I collapsed I send the card back to my wife I said what's wrong and she opens it up well you know the funny thing is after we kind of got our senses together we realized the mail hadn't even came yet this this letter had been in the mailbox before I ever cried out before I ever asked [Applause] my provid the whole time God is standing there hey go to the mailbox just go on to the mailbox I got it taken care hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh praise I'm here to tell you this morning we have a mailbox already been written there already there don't get what you have NE he has taken your cake Hallelujah if you're sick this morning let's go to the mail if you're down and depressed let's go to the mail Hallelujah [Applause] if I have [Applause] you hallelujah it's already been Rich already been hallelujah hallelujah we don't have to have a preacher tell us somebody else say [Music] spoken already written already taking it was done before you even ask Hallelujah the token is a is that we have been pardoned the case is closed every man and woman that's truly beenn received the baptism of he has been identified with his attorney his judge his sacrifice sacrif it is over Hallelujah but as we would bring this around a pardon is not a pardon unless it's accepted [Music] as there was a man one time who was uh been had been guilty of treason and his friend went to president lincol said president don't you know please don't kill my friend he didn't he didn't mean to do that he he got caught up something he he he want he's a good man but if he's not spared he's going to die but if you would just sign hison and Abraham Lincoln pulled out a piece of paper I Abraham Lincoln abah lincol pardon this man of and he shall not die and he signed his name the man gave God gave him God's blessings and return back and he said to his friend I have your pardon here it is just a little piece of paper with a few things written to this man it didn't look legal enough he said no I have you pardon here signed by the president and here he had been released by Abraham Lincoln to be free he had been released from the and here he is taken out before fire s and put to death pardon with his name written he was tried in the federal courts how a man can be put to death and it the verdict was a pardon is not a unless it's accepted as a a pardon from God is a release from guilt but you cannot be released unless you accept and say I have been forgiven yes I I've done wrong took my he signed it therefore I can be free Grace has been extended unmerited favor has been given to every person in heard the word
