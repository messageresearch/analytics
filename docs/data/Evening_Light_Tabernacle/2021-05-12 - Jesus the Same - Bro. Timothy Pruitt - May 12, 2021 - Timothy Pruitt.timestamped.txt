[32:02] each and every need we ask it in jesus
[32:04] name
[32:06] amen amen let's turn to hebrews
[32:11] 13 and 8.
[32:16] man seems like quite a long time since
[32:17] we stood here
[32:19] amen but we're glad to be here with you
[32:21] tonight amen
[32:24] very very familiar scripture
[32:27] that no doubt we all could
[32:30] recite by heart of this one verse but i
[32:34] want to read all the way down to verse
[32:36] 15. it says jesus christ the same
[32:40] yesterday
[32:41] and today and forever be not carried
[32:45] about with divers and strength doctrines
[32:47] for it is a good thing that the heart be
[32:49] established with grace
[32:51] not with meats which have not profited
[32:53] them that had been occupied therein
[32:56] we have an altar wherever they have no
[32:58] right to eat which serve the tabernacle
[33:00] for the bodies of those beasts whose
[33:02] blood is brought into the sanctuary by
[33:04] the high priest for sin
[33:06] are burned without the camp wherefore
[33:09] jesus
[33:09] also that he might sanctify the people
[33:12] with his own blood
[33:13] suffered without the gate let us go
[33:16] forth
[33:17] therefore unto him without the camp
[33:19] bearing his reproach
[33:21] for here we have no continuing city but
[33:24] we seek one to come
[33:26] by him therefore let us offer the
[33:29] sacrifice of praise to god continually
[33:32] that is the fruit of our lips giving
[33:34] thanks
[33:35] to his name also in joshua 3 7
[33:39] and the lord said unto joshua this day
[33:42] will i begin to magnify thee
[33:44] in the sight of all israel that they may
[33:47] know
[33:47] that as i was with moses so i will be
[33:52] with thee amen god bless you today and
[33:56] be seated
[33:59] i'd like to speak to you this evening on
[34:01] jesus the same
[34:03] i think it was a very wonderful song to
[34:07] be brought out to or magnify the lord
[34:09] with me
[34:10] amen because he has a name that's worthy
[34:12] to be praised
[34:14] amen if there's any name that's worthy
[34:16] of praise is this name
[34:18] there's any name that's worthy of
[34:20] adoration
[34:21] it's this name you know we live in a
[34:24] world that is shifting
[34:25] and changing so fast that it's
[34:28] almost very different from one day to
[34:31] the next day
[34:32] you know one day you can be at peace and
[34:34] the next day you can be at war and
[34:36] one day things can be going along pretty
[34:38] good the next day it's all falling apart
[34:41] it's simply a fact that we live in an
[34:43] age when everything seems to be changing
[34:45] before our eyes and not not in years and
[34:49] and decades but very m this moments and
[34:52] minutes
[34:53] things are changing in fact you know
[34:56] technology is developing so quickly
[34:58] that if you know if we listed the
[35:00] devices that represent the new
[35:02] technology today tomorrow when you got
[35:04] out of bed that new technology that we
[35:06] listed tonight could very well be
[35:08] outdated
[35:09] and something new took his place by
[35:11] morning because we are living in a very
[35:14] changing time
[35:16] you know not only have we seen
[35:17] technology change
[35:19] quickly but we've seen politics change
[35:21] quickly
[35:22] we've seen political parties change
[35:24] quickly we've seen
[35:25] national and international boundaries
[35:27] change very quickly and
[35:29] currencies change and you know the list
[35:31] goes on and on
[35:32] because we're living in a changing world
[35:34] and in the midst of this climate of
[35:36] sweeping changes
[35:38] the world has been caught up scores of
[35:40] people have been
[35:41] had been swept swept into a a just a
[35:45] global shift in core biblical views and
[35:48] morals and and you know even concerning
[35:51] the most basic of faith
[35:53] you know and things that people have
[35:54] been shifted very quickly and changed
[35:57] very quickly
[35:58] people have abandoned the formal things
[36:00] they held very dear
[36:02] and are grasping newer easier new easier
[36:04] to live supposed truths
[36:07] you know in the midst of this
[36:08] ever-changing world it's good to
[36:10] remember
[36:11] there's one thing that never changes
[36:14] man changes government changes uh
[36:17] the world changes city politics earthly
[36:20] politics changes
[36:22] but there's one thing that never changes
[36:24] and that's jesus christ
[36:26] he he he was in the past exactly
[36:30] who he is in the present amen and
[36:33] precisely who he will be forever
[36:36] amen what uh what a foundation we can
[36:38] stand on today i
[36:39] i'm thankful that my peace is not
[36:41] dependent upon my government or
[36:43] or even my own life and things because
[36:45] all that can be changed very quickly
[36:47] but the peace that i have passes all
[36:49] understanding
[36:50] amen the joy that i have does not come
[36:53] from the world and the things around me
[36:55] but it becomes from an unchanging source
[36:58] and that source does not change
[37:00] depending on what politics says or
[37:02] or what the world says or what the world
[37:05] is dictating
[37:06] jesus christ never changes amen you know
[37:09] as we read here hebrews 13 8 says jesus
[37:12] christ
[37:13] is the same yesterday today and forever
[37:17] this this word the same emphatically
[37:20] states that jesus christ
[37:22] is unchangeable
[37:25] hallelujah and i'm thankful for that
[37:27] because because if
[37:28] he's unchangeable then his attitude is
[37:30] unchanging his thoughts are unchanging
[37:32] his word is unchanging
[37:34] as i've said before i'm thankful i'm not
[37:36] serving a god who thinks of me one way
[37:38] one day
[37:39] and the next day he thinks of me a
[37:40] different way that'd be a terrible way
[37:42] to live amen
[37:43] but the god that called us is the same
[37:45] god that loves us
[37:46] is the same god that stands with us and
[37:48] he's the same god who will never leave
[37:50] us or forsake us
[37:51] but will be with us through the end of
[37:53] the world that's the promise amen
[37:55] and so you know they say this say this
[37:57] word saying means
[37:58] jesus christ is unchangeable he's the
[38:01] one we can depend upon
[38:03] to be the same regardless of time or
[38:06] regardless of the spirit of the age
[38:09] amen he does not change no matter how
[38:11] dark he gets
[38:12] he does not change no matter how sick
[38:14] how bad the sickness gets
[38:16] he don't change how bad no matter how
[38:18] bad the political system gets
[38:20] he don't change amen god is god
[38:23] and he don't change what he did did
[38:26] before he was the same yesterday today
[38:29] and forevermore i'm glad to serve him
[38:31] because he don't change
[38:33] amen he's the one we can depend upon in
[38:36] our times of crisis because
[38:38] he don't change amen he stays the same
[38:41] he stays there
[38:42] amen upon his word his word don't change
[38:45] it's on
[38:46] shifting it's unchangeable it's
[38:48] unstoppable it remains the same
[38:50] no matter how hard the devil fights
[38:52] against it no matter how hard
[38:54] all hell comes against it it remains the
[38:57] same
[38:59] amen and so we don't need to refigure or
[39:02] redefine who jesus is
[39:04] or what he thinks or what his message is
[39:07] because he
[39:08] is the same hallelujah and everything he
[39:11] represents
[39:12] is the same yesterday today and forever
[39:16] the word yesterday it depicts all time
[39:19] that ever
[39:19] was up to this present moment or in
[39:22] other words it describes
[39:24] all of the past so paul would say he was
[39:27] he's the same today as he was yesterday
[39:30] so if you want to know who god is today
[39:32] go see who he was yesterday
[39:34] because the god that was yesterday is
[39:36] the god today
[39:38] amen that's why we could say that your
[39:40] jehovah of the old testament
[39:42] is the jesus of the new because we saw
[39:44] him operate and act exactly the same
[39:47] he moved exactly the same he delivered
[39:50] his people
[39:51] he set his people free he healed their
[39:53] sicknesses
[39:54] he touched them all the types in the old
[39:56] testament he came and fulfilled
[39:58] in the new testament the same
[40:02] hallelujah amen the word today means
[40:05] today
[40:06] or at this very moment or this current
[40:08] age
[40:09] it depicts the present the right now
[40:12] amen he is the same
[40:14] and using these words together yesterday
[40:17] today and forever
[40:18] it shows or portrays a continuity
[40:22] amen a continuity of god the words
[40:24] yesterday and today
[40:25] are an expression to show there's
[40:28] continuity amen we find that jesus
[40:31] isn't one way in the past and another
[40:33] way in the presence
[40:35] or he isn't full of power one day and
[40:37] lost his power the next day
[40:39] he isn't healing one day and can't heal
[40:41] the next day
[40:43] it doesn't matter what man says about
[40:46] god if god said he's the healer
[40:48] he's still the healer it doesn't matter
[40:51] what a church depicts or decor
[40:53] declares it does not matter that does
[40:54] not determine who he is
[40:56] his word determines who he is and his
[40:59] word says
[41:00] he's a healer he's a deliverer he's a
[41:02] savior
[41:03] he's already done those things and what
[41:05] he did before
[41:07] he still does today because he is the
[41:09] same.
[41:12] amen whatever he was in the past is
[41:15] exactly who he is in the present
[41:18] therefore if you discover jesus of the
[41:21] past
[41:22] you've also discovered jesus of the
[41:24] present
[41:26] or if you've discovered jesus of the
[41:28] future and or you've also discovered him
[41:31] of the future because he's continually
[41:33] the same the word forever means in
[41:36] all ages of the future and all in
[41:39] all time to come this phrase depicts
[41:43] all future time to come including all
[41:46] ages
[41:46] that'll ever be known so in the
[41:49] millennium he'll be the same
[41:51] in eternity he'll be the same today he's
[41:54] the same
[41:57] you know the prophet of god will begin
[41:59] to cry this out in his ministry
[42:01] as he would come here and begin that
[42:02] screen would begin to cry out
[42:04] and he said he would say it like this he
[42:06] said the theme of my revivals is this
[42:10] declaring to the world that jesus christ
[42:13] is the same yesterday today and forever
[42:18] amen he said that through every critic
[42:21] and every type of criticism i that i
[42:24] know that satan has done
[42:25] everything i know could be done speaking
[42:27] of to try to overthrow that
[42:29] but every time god has brought it out
[42:31] triumphantly
[42:33] and won a victory every time
[42:36] hallelujah check it test it it's been
[42:38] tested
[42:39] government agents everything else i've
[42:41] seen and sworn it he said i have a thorn
[42:43] in the flesh
[42:44] an angel of satan who follows and tries
[42:46] to buff it or tries to beset that
[42:48] but he's been defeated in every case by
[42:51] the holy spirit
[42:52] and god has come through every time
[42:55] triumphantly
[42:57] and now i'm here to declare he's still
[42:59] the same
[43:01] so if it came through every time
[43:02] triumphantly and back 50 60 years ago
[43:05] he's still the same this god has not
[43:08] lost a battle
[43:09] and he's not about to lose a battle
[43:13] hallelujah but he comes out every time
[43:16] winning and triumphant
[43:21] this is what he would say this is what
[43:23] was said of him when you can read in
[43:25] revel
[43:25] revelations 2 about the one who walketh
[43:28] in the midst of the seven golden
[43:30] candlesticks
[43:31] he this is he of whom it is said it's
[43:34] the same
[43:35] jesus both lord and christ
[43:38] the only the one and only the lord god
[43:40] almighty
[43:41] and beside him there is no other there
[43:44] he is the savior
[43:46] walking in the midst of the churches
[43:48] throughout the seven church ages
[43:51] amen did he save people in the first
[43:53] church age
[43:54] did he save him in the second church age
[43:56] the third church age the fourth the
[43:58] fifth
[43:58] the sixth is he gonna save somebody in
[44:00] the seventh
[44:02] he has to because he's the same
[44:06] hallelujah he didn't come to the seventh
[44:07] age to call it quits and say i'm done
[44:10] with it
[44:10] and throw up his hands in the feed no
[44:13] sir he came just as victorious
[44:15] and just as triumphant as he did in the
[44:18] first he's doing it again in the last
[44:20] stage
[44:22] i don't know any showing hell even
[44:24] tonight i still heal
[44:26] i still deliver i still set free
[44:30] because i am the same
[44:36] he's walking in the midst of his
[44:37] churches throughout the seven ages
[44:40] what he was in the first age he is in
[44:42] all ages
[44:44] oh my mama to every believer
[44:47] how many believers do we have here in
[44:49] the building well he's the same god to
[44:51] you
[44:52] as he was to paul he's the same god to
[44:55] you as he was to moses
[44:57] to know all of the old testament
[44:59] prophets
[45:00] and believers down through the old
[45:01] testament and all the ones down to the
[45:03] new
[45:04] he's the same god to you the believer in
[45:06] this seventh church age
[45:08] [Music]
[45:12] he is jesus christ the same yesterday
[45:14] today and forever
[45:16] what he did once he's still doing
[45:21] and will keep on doing it does not
[45:25] matter what a church declares
[45:27] it does not matter what man declares it
[45:30] only matters what he
[45:32] said and what he said what he's not what
[45:35] what he did wants he's still doing how
[45:38] you say that's brother branham
[45:39] no that's what the scripture says he's
[45:41] the same yesterday
[45:42] today and forever
[45:46] what he did once he's still doing amen
[45:49] what he did on the day of pentecost he's
[45:51] still doing
[45:53] he's still feeling with the holy ghost
[45:55] he's still changing hearts
[45:57] he's still lifting up young people and
[46:00] the darkest age has ever been
[46:02] just like he did in the first days he
[46:04] had young people that served him
[46:05] in this hour he has young people that
[46:08] serves him
[46:09] hallelujah he's still raising the dead
[46:12] he's still there he's still making the
[46:14] lame to walk
[46:15] [Applause]
[46:18] he's still healing he's still delivering
[46:22] he's still doing all of that the wall to
[46:24] try to tell you he's not
[46:26] but his word says he is the worders of
[46:29] the world are trying to tell you he's
[46:31] not to say
[46:32] but his word declares i am the lord god
[46:35] and i change not
[46:41] he says you notice jesus is walking
[46:44] along in the midst of the churches alone
[46:46] there's no one else with him neither
[46:49] indeed can there be
[46:51] for he alone wrought her salvation
[46:57] amen
[47:00] i don't see a man calls himself the holy
[47:02] spirit walking there
[47:04] i don't see a man that calls himself
[47:05] elohim elohim walking there
[47:07] he alone walks in the churches
[47:10] and the candlesticks all the glory
[47:13] belongs to him
[47:15] all the praise belongs to him all the
[47:18] worship belongs to him
[47:19] and if you're giving worship to a man
[47:21] you're idolatry
[47:24] you're a heathen you need salvation in
[47:28] your dark stricken soul
[47:30] because our god deserves all the glory
[47:36] he goes on to say says it he says see
[47:39] there's no one else but him he alone
[47:41] wrought her salvation
[47:43] and has purchased her with his own blood
[47:45] he owns her
[47:48] man that's some shouting grounds right
[47:50] there
[47:52] he owns her how many he's heard there
[47:55] tonight
[47:56] then he owns you the devil said he did
[47:59] but the devil lied to you
[48:01] he tried to keep you with his nonsense
[48:03] and his worldly thing
[48:05] but that was that wasn't who owned you
[48:08] you were born in a fallen condition but
[48:10] that's not who owns you
[48:12] he owns you god owns that body
[48:16] and the devil can't do nothing with it
[48:23] and she gives him all the glory and that
[48:26] glory he will not share with another
[48:28] therefore there is no pope with him
[48:30] there is no archbishop with him
[48:33] mary the mother of his earthly bodies
[48:35] not with him
[48:36] there's not a prophet with him
[48:40] amen there's no there's no one else but
[48:43] him
[48:43] he does not speak and turn to a father
[48:46] for he is the father
[48:48] he does not turn and give orders to the
[48:49] holy spirit for he is god the eternal
[48:52] spirit
[48:53] and it is his life that's flowing and
[48:55] pulsating in the church
[48:56] and giving her life and without him
[48:59] there would be
[49:00] no life salvation is of the lord
[49:05] there is no one with him when he tries
[49:06] the fierceness of his wrath
[49:08] of the fiery furnace it was not another
[49:10] it was him
[49:11] who hung up on the cross and gave his
[49:14] blood he is the author and the finisher
[49:16] of our faith
[49:17] he is the alpha and omega of our
[49:19] salvation and we are espoused to him
[49:22] and not another we don't belong to the
[49:25] church
[49:25] we belong to him his word is law creed's
[49:29] dogmas bylaws constitution
[49:31] have no effect on his yes it is jesus
[49:34] alone
[49:34] who walks in the midst of his church it
[49:37] is god
[49:38] in her willing and doing his own good
[49:41] pleasure
[49:42] never forget that you have only one
[49:45] relationship to god
[49:46] and god has only one relationship to you
[49:49] and that is jesus
[49:50] and jesus alone
[49:56] he would take another place about the
[49:58] spirits of god
[50:00] and he said it wasn't seven different
[50:01] spirits it was one spirit working in
[50:03] seven church ages
[50:05] it's one in the same he said he will
[50:06] always be the same
[50:08] he will always act the same he said the
[50:11] seven
[50:11] messengers will have the same spirit and
[50:13] teach the same word
[50:15] and have the same power
[50:18] and if the church is the true church it
[50:20] will have the very same spirit
[50:22] the very same word the very same acts of
[50:25] power they had at pentecost
[50:29] why because he's the same and it's him
[50:31] walking through the churches
[50:34] it's him it's not a man it's not it's
[50:36] not a prophet it's not a pope
[50:38] it's not an archbishop it's him amen and
[50:41] he said if
[50:41] it's a true church it'll have the same
[50:44] word it'll have the same spirit
[50:46] it'll have the same acts of the power
[50:48] they had in pentecost by experience
[50:51] it will be a pentecostal church
[50:54] because it's the same there will be
[50:57] tongues there will be interpretation and
[50:59] prophecies
[51:00] and healings and god will be in the
[51:03] midst of her
[51:05] and god will be in the midst of her and
[51:07] god
[51:08] will declare himself in the midst of her
[51:11] as he always has
[51:14] whoa how did he declare himself as them
[51:16] two apostles walked to the gate called
[51:18] beautiful
[51:19] that man was out there begging for harm
[51:20] they said silver and gold have unknown
[51:23] but what i have
[51:24] i'll give it unto you in the name of
[51:26] jesus christ
[51:27] rise up and walk hallelujah
[51:30] and god declared what they said to be
[51:33] the truth
[51:33] because out of them came a power that
[51:36] would speak to a
[51:37] a body that was lame and not walking and
[51:40] shriveled up and died
[51:41] and all of a sudden power would leave
[51:43] their lips
[51:44] and enter into a body and their body
[51:46] rise up
[51:47] and begin to dance and shout and give
[51:50] god praise
[51:51] god was vindicated i am in their midst
[52:00] and if a church says they believe jesus
[52:02] christ is the
[52:04] same yesterday today and forever but
[52:06] deny his power
[52:08] deny his works deny his words
[52:11] the church that believes in jesus christ
[52:13] will
[52:14] do the works of jesus christ
[52:18] because it has the life of jesus christ
[52:23] he said when a man stands and says he's
[52:25] a gospel preacher
[52:27] and wants to say the days of miracles
[52:29] are passed
[52:30] he said that's a seed of discrepancy
[52:32] when a man says and says he's a minister
[52:34] a pastor of a church so
[52:35] and he does not believe that jesus
[52:38] christ is the same
[52:40] in every detail
[52:44] look at the details
[52:48] amen a lot of details there but people
[52:51] want to cut some of them out because it
[52:52] don't fit what they're
[52:53] they're they they think it ought to be
[52:55] anymore
[52:58] he said the same in every detail except
[53:02] the physical body
[53:03] but the same yesterday today and forever
[53:06] that's a seed of discrepancy
[53:11] except the physical body what is it now
[53:15] it's not jesus in one flesh anymore
[53:18] him walking through minden and him him
[53:21] going down the interstate in a car and
[53:22] him going to work
[53:24] it's not him walking as he did 2000
[53:26] years ago but we know
[53:28] on the day of pentecost he put forth his
[53:30] spirit into men
[53:31] and it was no longer jesus with them it
[53:34] was jesus in them
[53:37] amen jesus walking in them talking in
[53:39] them
[53:40] as we saw it as we just talked about it
[53:42] it was jesus same
[53:43] jesus that was just a few days ago in
[53:46] shoe leather
[53:46] healing the lame saving the loss
[53:49] touching bodies
[53:50] yeah i mean delivering bound people all
[53:53] of a sudden how's jesus
[53:54] in a body again but not that body but
[53:58] many bodies
[54:02] amen and this is what we believe in this
[54:04] day
[54:05] it's not jesus in a physical form as he
[54:07] was 2000 years ago
[54:09] but there still is a jesus on this earth
[54:12] there is still a body here on this earth
[54:15] and that body is called the bride of
[54:17] jesus christ
[54:18] and but it's not her spirit it's not her
[54:20] mind
[54:21] it's not her power it's the same god
[54:24] working through her
[54:25] speaking through her touching lives
[54:27] changing hearts
[54:29] healing the sick
[54:33] hallelujah anyone that says
[54:36] the miracles and the apostolic ages pass
[54:39] as a seed of discrepancy
[54:41] when they say there's no such thing as
[54:43] divine healing that's a seed of
[54:44] discrepancy
[54:46] and the world is full of it
[54:49] but the life as we know comes through
[54:51] the vine and we are the branches
[54:54] but it's the same life if it's not the
[54:57] same life
[54:58] in that branch it'll give a different
[55:00] fruit
[55:02] i mean we've heard that right i mean how
[55:04] many has ever grafted a tree
[55:07] anybody out there ever grafted a tree i
[55:09] can remember somebody
[55:10] doing that and they would take an orange
[55:11] and put it on another citrus and do
[55:14] things and
[55:14] and it was just amazing that that that
[55:16] limb could still give forth whatever
[55:18] life was in it
[55:20] but it could never bear the original
[55:22] because it wasn't of the original
[55:25] but he said when that when that vine
[55:28] ever puts forth another branch
[55:30] it'll be just like the original and
[55:33] it'll have the same fruits as the
[55:34] original
[55:35] there'll be healings in that branch
[55:37] there'll be deliverances in that branch
[55:40] there'll be testimonies in that branch
[55:42] of god's amazing grace and
[55:44] salvations in that brain there'll be
[55:46] baptism of the holy ghost in that branch
[55:48] there'll be the lame that can walk again
[55:50] in that branch it'll be the blind that
[55:52] can see again in that branch
[55:54] there'll be so much healing and
[55:56] deliverance why it's the same
[55:58] life amen
[56:01] he said if the vine ever puts forth
[56:03] another branch it'll be the same kind of
[56:05] branch
[56:06] that the acts that the book of acts was
[56:08] wrote on
[56:09] it'll have the same doctrine it'll have
[56:11] the same power
[56:12] it'll show the same signs because it's
[56:15] the same kind of church
[56:16] they had at the beginning not a new
[56:20] church the same kind
[56:22] not a new power the same kind
[56:31] he said it i referenced it a while ago
[56:33] in malachi 3 6
[56:34] he says i am the lord and i change not
[56:38] it's man that changes him not god that
[56:42] changes he
[56:42] man changes him how's he changing by
[56:45] changing his word
[56:49] god cannot change he's infinite
[56:52] what he did it before still works today
[56:56] so he gave a prescription for overcoming
[56:58] and being baptized with the holy ghost
[57:00] that prescription is still good today
[57:04] i don't care what theologian says it
[57:05] ain't and we get it a different way and
[57:07] we get it without sensation and
[57:09] it still happens the same way
[57:14] amen the prescription will work
[57:18] every time if you give it the same way
[57:21] as
[57:21] the prophet of god if you give it the
[57:23] same way the prescription will work the
[57:25] same way
[57:26] this we're not dealing with a man-made
[57:28] prescription a man-made
[57:30] drug where sometimes you know you can
[57:32] put it in you know uh
[57:34] brother jr and he'll have certain side
[57:36] effects you can put it in brother aaron
[57:37] he'll have other side effects
[57:39] you can put it in me and it'll have
[57:40] other side effects it's man-made stuff
[57:43] but we're not talking about man-made
[57:44] creeds and man-made dogmas
[57:46] we're talking about the life that was
[57:48] given on the day of pentecost
[57:51] amen it's not man-made it's god made
[57:54] therefore it has the same side effect
[57:57] if it's given to the the same way that
[58:00] peter gave it
[58:01] it'll have the same effect on every
[58:03] person that takes it
[58:04] it'll change their life it'll rewrite
[58:06] their history and mercy will be poured
[58:09] out upon them
[58:10] and they'll never want to go back to
[58:11] what they ever was before
[58:13] if it's given the same way it'll have
[58:15] the same effects
[58:17] it'll change their lives it'll change
[58:19] their hearts it'll change their motives
[58:21] it'll change their objectives it'll
[58:23] change everything about them
[58:25] why because if it's given the same way
[58:27] it'll have the same effects
[58:29] [Applause]
[58:30] hallelujah and i believe we're living in
[58:32] a time that we ought to be giving it
[58:35] the same way peter gave it
[58:36] [Applause]
[58:38] men and brother repent and be baptized
[58:41] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[58:43] ye shall
[58:45] receive the holy ghost that's not a hope
[58:47] so
[58:48] it'll have that effect that's not a
[58:51] maybe
[58:52] that's not a maybe some way no it'll
[58:54] have the same effect
[58:56] the same one it had on peter it turned
[58:59] him from a man that couldn't hold his
[59:01] temper
[59:01] and he would say all kinds of things
[59:03] without even thinking he would do all
[59:05] kinds of things to wherever jesus would
[59:07] rebuke him and say get behind me satan
[59:10] and he would deny him but when he took
[59:13] that prescription
[59:16] it changed him amen he stand up on a
[59:20] soapbox
[59:21] and preach the gospel of jesus christ
[59:23] and 3 000
[59:24] souls give their hearts to god why they
[59:27] have the same effects
[59:29] it'll put something in you to want to
[59:31] tell somebody what god did for you
[59:35] amen this prescription this baptism
[59:39] this holy ghost is the same power
[59:43] it's not just shake hands and say well
[59:45] i'm going to turn over new leaf and i'm
[59:47] going to do better
[59:49] you know people get a little they get
[59:51] that they they come through a prayer
[59:52] line and
[59:53] get a touch and they think well i'm just
[59:56] going to turn over a new league i want
[59:57] to do better
[59:58] you know i'm going to do better about my
[59:59] church attendance uh i'm going to do
[1:00:01] better about things
[1:00:03] and they're just turning over new leafs
[1:00:07] many times but if it's ever went down
[1:00:09] and you took the prescription
[1:00:13] there won't be no more turning over new
[1:00:14] leaves then it won't even be debatable
[1:00:17] if you need to be in the house of god or
[1:00:18] not
[1:00:21] it won't be noticeable you know this
[1:00:23] prescription deals with your excuses
[1:00:26] it changes your excuse it takes away
[1:00:28] your excuses
[1:00:30] the excuses of why you can't live it or
[1:00:32] won't learn and that won't clean up
[1:00:34] won't change
[1:00:35] take the prescription it'll deal with it
[1:00:38] it'll change you
[1:00:39] amen same power
[1:00:42] let's not turn a new loop let new leaf
[1:00:44] and do better shake hands with the
[1:00:46] preacher
[1:00:47] no sir you shall receive the holy ghost
[1:00:50] the power of god will come upon you and
[1:00:52] change your ways
[1:00:53] he said speak in tongues you'll lay
[1:00:55] hands on the sick cast out devils do the
[1:00:57] same as they did
[1:01:03] for how long to the end of the disciples
[1:01:06] that's what man wants to say is to the
[1:01:07] end of the disciples that was just for
[1:01:09] the disciples or
[1:01:10] other greater works was just for the
[1:01:11] prophet
[1:01:13] it would have put limitations on god god
[1:01:15] don't put limitations on himself man
[1:01:17] puts limitations on god
[1:01:21] amen he said to the end of the disciples
[1:01:24] he said you're a false prophet if you
[1:01:25] say that
[1:01:28] for jesus christ the bible teaches us
[1:01:30] he's the same yesterday
[1:01:31] and the promise is unto you and your
[1:01:34] children
[1:01:35] and to them that are far off he says say
[1:01:38] it with me how many
[1:01:40] every age every generation every color
[1:01:43] ever creed
[1:01:44] for everyone every whatever it is as
[1:01:47] many as god calls
[1:01:48] and if god calls you he commands you to
[1:01:51] be baptized
[1:01:52] in the name of jesus christ and receive
[1:01:54] the holy ghost
[1:01:55] then christ himself lives in you and
[1:01:57] there's never
[1:01:58] no more uncertainty to it you've got the
[1:02:00] bible and you stand on it
[1:02:02] you can live on it you can die on it and
[1:02:05] you'll rise
[1:02:06] on it he said just like rebecca who
[1:02:09] watered the camel
[1:02:10] the very camels that she watered she
[1:02:12] rode out to meet her bridegroom
[1:02:14] and the very god that we preach about
[1:02:16] the very word which is god the very god
[1:02:19] that's in the word
[1:02:20] will rise us up someday by the baptism
[1:02:23] of the holy ghost
[1:02:24] and he said and our critics will be
[1:02:26] killed by the same power
[1:02:28] that raises you into glory

[1:05:09] but he said anybody knew him knew paul
[1:05:12] was a believer in divine healing i mean
[1:05:14] that

[1:05:48] god's word don't change
[1:05:52] amen kept on going after a while he
[1:05:55] passed completely out
[1:05:57] he said he thought he had a dream back
[1:05:59] there in oregon somewhere you know
[1:06:01] he's raised up he's back there again and
[1:06:03] he was a a
[1:06:05] he used to chop wood and timber a logger
[1:06:08] for a living
[1:06:09] his boss was in the logwood said paul go
[1:06:11] up
[1:06:12] and take a certain tree about certain
[1:06:14] size and bring it down here and said all
[1:06:16] right
[1:06:16] in this dream he went up this hill and
[1:06:18] climbed it smelling them wonderful pine
[1:06:20] needles
[1:06:20] having himself a glorious time said he
[1:06:23] took the tree and he
[1:06:25] he fell it struck his axe down in it
[1:06:29] took it down said it fell down he
[1:06:32] trimmed all the limbs off of it made it
[1:06:33] the size of the boss ask and
[1:06:35] said he reached down to grab it because
[1:06:37] the boss had told him to take it back to
[1:06:38] camp
[1:06:39] so he reached down and put his knees
[1:06:41] down and squatted down into position his
[1:06:43] muscles began to bulge and
[1:06:45] his legs and he put all the effort he
[1:06:46] could into it but he couldn't move it
[1:06:49] he couldn't change it he said i've lost
[1:06:51] my strength i
[1:06:52] i i can't i can't get that log up he
[1:06:55] said i used to pack twice that size
[1:06:57] tried again and wrestled and wrestled
[1:06:59] until he just wore out
[1:07:02] if what was it he said it was that fever
[1:07:04] just depleted him
[1:07:06] and he said here he was wrestling and
[1:07:09] trying to get it back to camp
[1:07:11] you know i just can't go no farther i'm
[1:07:12] gone and he wrestled
[1:07:15] he said your brother adam was saying he
[1:07:16] said that's the way a lot of people do
[1:07:19] he said they just take a word and they
[1:07:21] try to run it over here and make it say
[1:07:22] this and make it do that
[1:07:24] wrestle with it take it through
[1:07:26] seminaries cut it out cut this out put
[1:07:28] this
[1:07:29] make a greek word out of it here hebrew

[1:07:32] becomes like that and it's not the word
[1:07:33] of god no more
[1:07:34] because you're wrestling with it he said
[1:07:37] you're wrestling with it you take it
[1:07:39] over some dr joel
[1:07:40] this dr phd and ask him what he thinks
[1:07:43] about it and ask what this one thinks
[1:07:45] about it
[1:07:45] he said well this my mental telepathy
[1:07:48] other one said it's fanaticism
[1:07:50] ah first thing you know you wrestle it
[1:07:51] all the way down to a meeting
[1:07:53] and the scene the spirit of god come
[1:07:55] down and heard someone speaking unknown
[1:07:57] tongues and
[1:07:57] you're wrestling with and calling the
[1:07:59] devil
[1:08:01] wrestling with it he said you hear
[1:08:04] people shout and he say well it's only
[1:08:05] just excitement
[1:08:07] he said you're just wrestling with it he
[1:08:09] said i seen a man stand on a platform by
[1:08:11] the power of discernment tell people who
[1:08:13] they were
[1:08:13] and out in the meetings and what was
[1:08:15] wrong just the way the bible said jesus
[1:08:17] done
[1:08:18] and show the sign of the messiah and i
[1:08:20] go ask my pastor and you go ask him he
[1:08:22] says it's telepathy
[1:08:23] and you just keep wrestling and you
[1:08:25] never get anywhere
[1:08:29] but directly he heard his boy his boss's
[1:08:31] voice call his name and say paul
[1:08:34] and he said yes boss he said ma that was
[1:08:36] the most sweetest voice
[1:08:38] i ever heard he said why are you
[1:08:39] wrestling with it for
[1:08:41] so i turned around and said it wasn't
[1:08:43] his boss it was his real boss
[1:08:47] it was jesus standing there he said paul
[1:08:50] you're just wrestling with it
[1:08:51] wrestling with it wrestling with it he
[1:08:54] said you see that stream of water laying
[1:08:56] right there
[1:08:57] i said yeah he said the stream of water
[1:08:59] comes right down to the camp
[1:09:02] he said why don't you just roll that log
[1:09:04] down to that river
[1:09:05] and ride it on down to the camp he said
[1:09:08] oh i never thought of that
[1:09:10] so he just pushed it over in the water
[1:09:12] and he jumped on it
[1:09:14] and the next thing you know he began to
[1:09:15] go down those ripples and those rapids
[1:09:18] he said he was just only splashing
[1:09:19] around having a good time
[1:09:21] and he began to scream out i'm rotting
[1:09:24] on it
[1:09:25] i'm riding on it and when he came to
[1:09:27] himself he was standing in the middle of
[1:09:29] the floor
[1:09:30] screaming to the top of his lungs
[1:09:32] absolutely healed saying i'm riding on
[1:09:35] it
[1:09:36] i'm riding on it i'm riding on it oh
[1:09:39] hallelujah
[1:09:40] the bible says jesus christ is the same
[1:09:43] yesterday today and forever
[1:09:45] i'm riding on it
[1:09:48] hallelujah the bible said by his stripes
[1:09:51] i'm healed i'm riding on it the bible
[1:09:55] said they shall be there
[1:09:56] and their offspring with them i'm riding
[1:09:59] on it
[1:10:00] hallelujah the bible says the works that
[1:10:03] i do shall you do also
[1:10:05] i ride knowledge
[1:10:07] [Music]
[1:10:09] hallelujah it's time some of you take
[1:10:11] those promises of god
[1:10:12] and quit wrestling on it wrestling with
[1:10:15] it and just roll it over
[1:10:17] into the stream of faith and say god
[1:10:20] i'm going to just jump on your word and
[1:10:22] where it takes me i'm going to go
[1:10:25] and i know if i jump on a promise that
[1:10:27] says he's the lord god
[1:10:29] that heals all my diseases and i put it
[1:10:31] into the stream of faith
[1:10:33] it's going to take me to my healing it's
[1:10:36] going to take me to my deliverance
[1:10:38] it's going to take me to all things are
[1:10:39] possible
[1:10:43] riding on it
[1:10:53] jesus the same in every detail
[1:10:57] except his physical body
[1:11:00] now it's not just one flesh or one man
[1:11:04] but many the mighty god the same
[1:11:08] yesterday today and forever
[1:11:10] and flesh hid behind human
[1:11:14] skin
[1:11:19] brother ronnie long spoke on saturday
[1:11:21] morning this comes to my mind
[1:11:24] i'd suggest go listen to a wonderful
[1:11:26] sermon all those was really good
[1:11:30] but my they said saturday morning as he
[1:11:32] spoke about
[1:11:33] god taking your flesh and your
[1:11:35] insecurities and your weaknesses
[1:11:38] and setting it up for the devil's defeat
[1:11:42] telling the devil it's a setup
[1:11:45] as we heard brother henry talk about
[1:11:47] jesus as he walked to the
[1:11:49] maniac of gatter and that man still
[1:11:51] stopped there
[1:11:52] and those demons looked in those eyes
[1:11:54] and said how did you get in there
[1:11:56] it's a setup amen
[1:12:00] the devil may look at you and he looked
[1:12:02] at jesus and thought there ain't no way
[1:12:03] he could be the messiah he studied him
[1:12:06] he tried him he
[1:12:07] talked to him he spoke to him but i just
[1:12:10] couldn't have because if he would have
[1:12:11] known
[1:12:12] that was the lord jesus christ the
[1:12:14] messiah he would have done everything he
[1:12:16] could to keep him as safe as possible
[1:12:19] don't touch him because you touch him
[1:12:22] and that blood's released
[1:12:24] it's going to cause all kind of trouble
[1:12:26] but he looked at him he didn't know it
[1:12:28] looked too humbly
[1:12:30] you know he looked too humble it wasn't
[1:12:31] impossible this could be the christ
[1:12:33] surely if his wife you know the devil no
[1:12:36] doubt talked to his demons
[1:12:37] in a security team many times and said
[1:12:39] you know i i i
[1:12:40] he can't be how would god come in a
[1:12:43] little baby
[1:12:45] how could he come in a human being
[1:12:48] of all things to choose why would he
[1:12:50] choose one of them frail little things
[1:12:53] one of them insignificant things i look
[1:12:55] at all of them down through the ages we
[1:12:57] killed every one of them
[1:12:59] we have defeated every one of them and
[1:13:01] there's no there's nothing they can do
[1:13:04] surely if he was gonna come he'd come
[1:13:06] with a a
[1:13:08] thousand ten thousand angel saluted
[1:13:10] horns would have blowed it
[1:13:11] he'd come out of the sky on a golden
[1:13:13] staircase and step down there and yeah
[1:13:15] then we'll know
[1:13:16] that's god but he didn't come that way
[1:13:21] insignificant
[1:13:25] there's no way
[1:13:29] but if it had been studying god's been
[1:13:31] hid that way a long time
[1:13:34] and see the devil don't know everything
[1:13:37] i know we'd like to give him a lot of
[1:13:38] credit but he don't know god has hid so
[1:13:40] much from him
[1:13:44] if he'd have known what was going to
[1:13:46] happen in the upper room he had done
[1:13:47] everything he could
[1:13:51] if he had known what's going to happen
[1:13:52] in this service he'd have done
[1:13:54] everything he could
[1:13:56] amen the old badger skins
[1:14:00] hid the glory of god badger skins
[1:14:03] i don't know if it's the same what we
[1:14:05] call a badger but apparently
[1:14:06] it wasn't a very good creature and i
[1:14:09] know badgers ain't very good creatures
[1:14:11] and i i could see them be equated to
[1:14:12] human beings because they're not very
[1:14:14] good creatures
[1:14:15] evil they'll take a baby's life without
[1:14:19] even thinking about it
[1:14:21] without even a moment's thought just to
[1:14:22] just destroy life
[1:14:24] after life until we're now in the
[1:14:26] millions and then murders and rapes and
[1:14:29] all the things that
[1:14:30] humans do to humans
[1:14:33] and god and the devil's like there's no
[1:14:35] way
[1:14:37] god could be there
[1:14:42] even people couldn't see it because it
[1:14:45] was the skin that held it
[1:14:47] the glory of god held behind skin
[1:14:50] and he said now the glory of god
[1:14:54] is hid behind your skin
[1:14:59] the god that we've been speaking about
[1:15:01] with the same power
[1:15:03] the same in every detail
[1:15:08] traditions don't see it it's inside the
[1:15:11] veil where the word was
[1:15:12] it was inside that skin back there those
[1:15:14] old badger skins
[1:15:16] there was no beauty we would desire when
[1:15:18] it was made flesh and dwelt among it
[1:15:20] there was no beauty there
[1:15:23] but now the same thing today there's
[1:15:24] nothing in a man or woman that can be
[1:15:26] desired
[1:15:27] it's what's behind there well you
[1:15:30] that fellow i know he used to be a
[1:15:32] drunkard he used to be this
[1:15:34] i don't care what he used to be
[1:15:37] i like to shout it when i heard this i
[1:15:39] don't care
[1:15:40] what it used to be what's hid behind
[1:15:43] that skid now
[1:15:45] is what counts
[1:15:50] well i used to do this and i used to do
[1:15:52] that and i used to be there
[1:15:53] i don't care what it used to be what
[1:15:57] counts is who's behind you now
[1:15:59] [Applause]
[1:16:05] skin the skin blinds people
[1:16:09] well i remember when that woman used to
[1:16:11] do this
[1:16:12] he said i know what she used to do but
[1:16:15] what about now
[1:16:18] them skins that was once on a badger
[1:16:21] but now they're hiding the glory of god
[1:16:24] got a house behind it it was an animal
[1:16:27] but now it's housed in the glory of god
[1:16:29] now
[1:16:29] one important thing to realize about
[1:16:31] that badger skin was that badger was
[1:16:33] dead
[1:16:36] there wasn't nothing in that badger that
[1:16:37] was alive try to hang those badges on
[1:16:39] that tent
[1:16:40] it tore the places there to put to apart
[1:16:42] if they was alive
[1:16:44] fighting and gnashing and carrying on
[1:16:46] and arguing and fussing oh yeah but
[1:16:48] we still got some live badgers don't win
[1:16:49] the church
[1:16:51] you can't be put in that moment that
[1:16:53] place to hide the
[1:16:54] glory of god until that badger skin is
[1:16:57] dead
[1:17:00] then it can hide the glory of god
[1:17:04] then your skin can be changed and be
[1:17:06] made a housing place for god god
[1:17:08] indwelling in humanity
[1:17:10] the whole badgers kins we find out
[1:17:12] inside there was a word
[1:17:13] and the word there was a bread the ark
[1:17:15] sprinkled the shekinah glory
[1:17:17] now the word is a seed it cannot bring
[1:17:19] forth unto the sun
[1:17:20] strikes it the sun's got to be on the
[1:17:22] sea to make it bring forth
[1:17:24] you take the word take the word of god
[1:17:25] your heart walk into this kind of glory
[1:17:27] when you do
[1:17:28] it'll bring the manna it'll bring the
[1:17:29] show bread it'll it only it's only given
[1:17:32] to a separated people
[1:17:33] the only ones that can eat it as
[1:17:35] permitted to eat it is people who's
[1:17:36] permitted to know
[1:17:37] it's there paul said changing us from
[1:17:39] glory to glory back
[1:17:41] to its original glory he said it's just
[1:17:44] like a seed
[1:17:45] of a morning glory the seed of a flower
[1:17:48] it falls in the ground
[1:17:49] and the seed of a corn falls in the
[1:17:51] ground what's the first thing it comes
[1:17:53] up as a little sprout
[1:17:55] all the way up into the tassel until
[1:17:58] we're at seed again
[1:18:02] as i've said before i there's not a
[1:18:05] person in this world that's got any
[1:18:06] sense to put a corn seed in the ground
[1:18:09] expecting the green bean to come out
[1:18:13] it ain't going to happen it's not
[1:18:16] possible
[1:18:17] if it's a corn at the beginning it'll be
[1:18:19] a corn at the end
[1:18:21] amen you can't get a plant a green bean
[1:18:23] and get a pea
[1:18:24] it's going to be what was planted in the
[1:18:26] grounds what's going to come forth
[1:18:28] that's the laws of god every seed shall
[1:18:30] bring forth after
[1:18:31] its kind amen
[1:18:34] so he planted the first church in the
[1:18:36] beginning they went into the ground
[1:18:39] believers paul all of those went into
[1:18:41] the ground
[1:18:42] down to the dark ages and we know as we
[1:18:44] saw the tithe the blade the tassel
[1:18:46] all the way back to where we are today
[1:18:48] back to seed again
[1:18:51] amen so if it had whatever whatever
[1:18:53] power
[1:18:54] or whatever life was in that corn at the
[1:18:56] beginning it's still the same in the
[1:18:58] at the end it's got life-sustaining
[1:19:01] power
[1:19:02] it's got amen that's got the ability to
[1:19:05] give life
[1:19:05] it's got the ability to sustain life
[1:19:08] amen so if god planted at the church at
[1:19:10] the beginning
[1:19:11] he was not expecting a different church
[1:19:13] at the end
[1:19:14] he was expecting the same church with
[1:19:16] the same power
[1:19:17] with the same life with the same works
[1:19:20] with the same signs and wonders same
[1:19:22] everything
[1:19:23] in every detail just different bodies
[1:19:27] hallelujah why because it wasn't the
[1:19:29] life of a man
[1:19:30] that was coming it wasn't the life of us
[1:19:33] hello somebody
[1:19:34] it was a life of god
[1:19:39] and he's moved all the way to where
[1:19:40] we're at
[1:19:42] and it's brought him back exactly
[1:19:45] what he was at the beginning
[1:19:48] this same ministry the same jesus the
[1:19:52] same power
[1:19:53] the same holy ghost the same one that
[1:19:56] come down on the day of pentecost
[1:19:58] is the same holy ghost that's manifested
[1:20:00] today from glory unto glory and glory
[1:20:02] it's back to the original sea with the
[1:20:05] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:20:06] the same signs the same wonders the same
[1:20:09] baptism
[1:20:10] the same kind of people acting the same
[1:20:13] way

[1:20:21] well i thought we're supposed to receive
[1:20:22] it without sensation he said the same
[1:20:24] sensation

[1:20:28] brother branham talks about mary
[1:20:30] when she got pregnant she received the
[1:20:32] seed without sensation
[1:20:36] and they equate that to the holy ghost
[1:20:37] no mary was getting pregnant
[1:20:40] bringing forth the son of god but when
[1:20:42] mary went up in the upper room
[1:20:46] read it the other night he said mary
[1:20:49] went up there

[1:21:48] he's changing us from glory to glory
[1:21:51] to glory and one of these days
[1:21:55] it's going to change us from this whole

[1:22:28] where we shall see him amen
[1:22:34] hallelujah let's go to joshua 4 1 for a
[1:22:39] moment
[1:22:43] as we read god spoke to joshua he said
[1:22:46] as i was with moses
[1:22:48] so shall i be with you what was that
[1:22:51] saying
[1:22:52] the very same god that was manifested in
[1:22:54] moses
[1:22:55] is the same one that's going to manifest
[1:22:57] himself in your life
[1:23:00] the same continuity he didn't change he
[1:23:03] didn't move he didn't waver
[1:23:04] he showed them to be the same very
[1:23:06] quickly and in this
[1:23:08] scripture it came to pass when all the
[1:23:10] people were clean passed over jordan
[1:23:12] that the lord spake unto joshua would
[1:23:14] say and take ye twelve men out of the
[1:23:16] people
[1:23:16] out of every tribe of man and command ye
[1:23:18] them saying
[1:23:20] take ye hints out of the midst of jordan
[1:23:22] out of the place where the priest's feet
[1:23:24] stood firm twelve stones
[1:23:28] and you shall carry them over with you
[1:23:31] and leave them in the lodging place
[1:23:32] where you should lodge this night
[1:23:35] then joshua said to the 12 men whom you
[1:23:38] ever whom you had prepared the children
[1:23:40] of israel out of every tribe of man and
[1:23:41] joshua 7 passover
[1:23:43] before the ark of the lord your god in
[1:23:44] the midst of the jordan and take you up
[1:23:47] every man of you a stone
[1:23:49] upon this shoulders upon his shoulders
[1:23:51] according unto the number of the tribes
[1:23:53] of children of israel
[1:23:54] that this may be a sign among you that
[1:23:57] when your children ask their fathers in
[1:24:00] time to come saying
[1:24:02] what mean ye by these stones
[1:24:06] why are these stones sitting here why
[1:24:09] you keep bringing them up
[1:24:11] why you keep talking about them why are
[1:24:14] they important why are they piled over
[1:24:16] there like that
[1:24:17] he said then you shall answer them that
[1:24:19] the waters of the jordan were cut off
[1:24:22] before the ark of the covenant of the
[1:24:24] lord
[1:24:24] when it was passed over jordan and the
[1:24:26] waters of jordan were cut off and these
[1:24:28] stones
[1:24:29] shall be for a memorial unto the
[1:24:31] children of israel forever
[1:24:33] and the children of israel did so as
[1:24:35] joshua commanded and they took 12 stones
[1:24:38] out of the midst of jordan
[1:24:39] and the lord spake unto joshua answering
[1:24:41] to the number of the tribes
[1:24:42] of the children of israel and carried
[1:24:44] them over with them under the place
[1:24:46] where they lodged and laid them down
[1:24:48] there and joshua set the swell stones in
[1:24:51] the midst of the jordan
[1:24:53] in the place where the feet of the
[1:24:54] priests were bare the ark of the
[1:24:56] covenant stood and they were they are
[1:24:57] there
[1:24:58] until this day for the priests which
[1:25:01] bear the ark stood in the midst of the
[1:25:02] jordan
[1:25:03] until everything was finished that the
[1:25:05] lord commanded joshua to speak unto the
[1:25:07] people
[1:25:08] according to all that moses commanded
[1:25:10] joshua and the people
[1:25:12] hastened and passed over and it came to
[1:25:14] pass
[1:25:15] when all the people were clean passed
[1:25:17] over that the ark of the lord passed
[1:25:18] over and the priests
[1:25:20] in the presence of the people and the
[1:25:21] children of reuben and the children of
[1:25:23] gad hath the tribe of manasseh
[1:25:25] passed over armed before the children of
[1:25:27] israel as moses spake unto them
[1:25:29] about forty thousand prepared for war
[1:25:31] passed over before the lord
[1:25:33] unto battle to the plains of the jericho
[1:25:35] and on that day the lord magnified
[1:25:38] joshua
[1:25:38] in the sight of all israel and they
[1:25:41] feared him
[1:25:42] as they feared moses why because they
[1:25:45] saw the same god
[1:25:46] that operated in moses is now operated
[1:25:49] in joshua
[1:25:51] and god said i want a memorial to mark
