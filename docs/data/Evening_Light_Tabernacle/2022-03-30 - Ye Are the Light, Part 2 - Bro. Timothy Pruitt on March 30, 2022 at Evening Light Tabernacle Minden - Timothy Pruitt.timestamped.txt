[37:04] amen i'll bring you
[37:06] greetings from uh brother fred mullins
[37:08] and
[37:09] and uh the assembly there in south
[37:11] carolina we was away ministering this
[37:13] weekend there
[37:15] and uh brother fred had had a stroke and
[37:18] had been under the weather for quite a
[37:20] while and the doctors had told him he
[37:21] couldn't get in the pulpit for a month
[37:23] so
[37:24] we went there to help him and and
[37:26] put her shoulder to the wheel and he
[37:28] said to be sure and tell you hello from
[37:30] him and the church the life tabernacle
[37:33] amen he said he'd love to meet us
[37:35] sometimes amen so let's let's just look
[37:38] here at matthew chapter 5 and verse 14
[37:41] ye are the light of the world
[37:44] a city that is set on a hill
[37:47] cannot be hid
[37:49] neither do men light a candle and put it
[37:51] under a bush
[37:52] but on a candlestick
[37:54] and it giveth light unto all that are in
[37:57] the house
[37:58] let your light so shine before men that
[38:01] you may see your good works that they
[38:03] may see your good works and glorify your
[38:06] father which is in heaven also john
[38:09] chapter 15 and verse 5 says i am the
[38:11] vine
[38:12] ye are the branches he that abideth in
[38:15] me and i in him the same bringeth forth
[38:18] much fruit for without me
[38:21] you can do nothing but if a man abide
[38:23] not in me his cast forth as a branch and
[38:26] is withered and men gather them and cast
[38:29] them into the fire and they are burned
[38:31] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[38:33] you
[38:34] you shall ask what you will and it shall
[38:37] be done unto you
[38:39] amen god bless you
[38:41] you can be seated
[38:50] like to speak to you again on you are
[38:52] the light
[38:53] amen my voice is a little bit weak so
[38:56] amen i'm going to
[38:57] try to try to help me tonight ye are the
[39:00] light you know it struck me back there
[39:02] in the office as i was looking over
[39:04] these things
[39:05] and the lord just kind of put it in my
[39:07] heart to look at it again
[39:09] and
[39:10] i looked at i began to read ye are the
[39:13] light
[39:14] you know and i i feel like this was
[39:16] actually more than just words that were
[39:18] written written on paper
[39:20] but jesus was actually saying as as he
[39:23] did
[39:24] as god would say in the beginning let
[39:26] there be light
[39:28] but it was actually a word that was
[39:30] spoke that created lights to a
[39:33] generation
[39:34] lights that would hang in light so as he
[39:36] would there on the day of creation he
[39:38] would speak let there be light in the
[39:41] sun as we've seen it today come out
[39:43] after the storm and it's still hanging
[39:45] there today stars that we watch at night
[39:47] and moon different things amen and no
[39:51] matter what no matter what the devil
[39:53] would try to do he couldn't stop the sun
[39:56] from shining he can't stop the stars
[39:58] from shining they'll shine as long as
[40:01] they are predestined to shine for
[40:03] destination to shine and so will you
[40:06] god actually spoke you into existence
[40:09] amen jesus and his words with these i
[40:11] believe these are creative words he said
[40:13] ye are the light so he could not make
[40:16] that statement unless there would be
[40:18] lights to be to be made manifest and
[40:21] this is what your brother brandon would
[40:22] talk about the spoken word amen coming
[40:25] into the bride he said in very plain
[40:27] language the true bride of christ was in
[40:30] the mind of god eternally though not
[40:32] expressed unto each came forth in this
[40:35] designated decreed season and as each
[40:38] member came forth it became expressed
[40:41] and took its place in the body thus this
[40:44] bride is the literal spoken word seed
[40:48] bribe and though she is effeminate in
[40:51] she is also called the body of christ
[40:54] and so it's very apparent that she ought
[40:56] to be called that for she's preached she
[40:58] was predestinated in him
[41:00] came from the same source what was
[41:03] eternal with him and now are manifesting
[41:06] god in a many-membered body whereas what
[41:09] god was once manifested in one member
[41:12] even our lord jesus christ but now he's
[41:15] manifested in many member bodies amen
[41:18] and so but all coming from the same
[41:20] source or or from the same power or for
[41:23] the same place amen we're not connected
[41:26] to something different than what he was
[41:28] connected to amen as we went through it
[41:30] it's depicted there in the golden
[41:32] candlesticks were all coming from that
[41:34] same place and so god's word would go
[41:37] out let there be light and so the light
[41:40] would go forth into every generation
[41:42] because god is not going to allow satan
[41:44] to have at all dark and all black until
[41:47] it's time to leave here and there's no
[41:49] more spoken word seed left upon this
[41:51] earth and then true darkness will come
[41:54] upon this earth as seen before the
[41:56] creation of the sun it's spiritually
[41:58] speaking but amen god has spoken amen
[42:01] and so through the dark ages through the
[42:03] times through the seven church ages he
[42:06] spoke it there would be light they would
[42:08] manifest they would come forth amen no
[42:10] matter what the doc the devil tried to
[42:12] do how he tried to stop it he tried to
[42:14] saw him asunder he tried to burn them he
[42:17] tried to
[42:18] murder him he tried to put them in
[42:19] prison their lights would keep shining
[42:22] he could not put it out and so so as we
[42:24] saw it all down through the ages and we
[42:27] come in the time that we're living in
[42:29] god is going to have a light upon the
[42:31] earth the devils are going to try to put
[42:33] it out they're going to try to uh force
[42:36] it out they're going to try to do
[42:37] everything they can to extinguish it but
[42:40] god's word amen will not amen will not
[42:42] we'll always be fulfilled it can't be
[42:45] stopped it's unstoppable if there's
[42:47] anything upon this earth that is
[42:49] unstoppable that is the word of god
[42:53] satan's been trying to stop it for
[42:54] thousands of years and he hasn't
[42:56] succeeded yet and he will never succeed
[42:59] because god's word will always fulfill
[43:03] and always come to manifestation and so
[43:05] god is going to have lights and brothers
[43:07] we spoke last time on this amen brother
[43:09] brown would say there was a stream of
[43:11] life here amen and down through there's
[43:13] a bunch of darkness and all the gayty
[43:15] and that's partying and carrying on it's
[43:17] a lot of darkness he said but every once
[43:19] in a while you'll see a light burning he
[43:22] said that's a born-again christian amen
[43:25] that's even in the darkness there's
[43:26] still light now we know light shines
[43:29] greatest in the dark and so god would so
[43:32] design this time that we're living in
[43:34] amen it'd be so dark it'll be
[43:37] you know but he said but he said in his
[43:38] word in the evening time in the dark
[43:41] time amen when time seems to be getting
[43:43] away it shall be light
[43:46] and so it's spoken words god is actually
[43:49] speaking you into existence in the time
[43:52] of darkness god is actually speaking and
[43:55] lights are coming on in darkness just
[43:57] like it did when the sun came and the
[43:59] stars came god is speaking it in this
[44:02] generation just like you did in paul
[44:04] irenaeus wesley martin luther all the
[44:08] way down god spoke and lights came on
[44:11] god spoke and lights came on god is
[44:13] still speaking and lights are still
[44:15] coming off
[44:16] amen lights are still being illuminated
[44:19] amen and satan is trying he's bringing
[44:21] all of his forces he's trying everything
[44:23] he can put it out he's trying to
[44:25] disqualify he's trying to bring it down
[44:28] and say it ain't real but lights are
[44:30] still coming off because you cannot stop
[44:33] the word of god god's word will be
[44:36] fulfilled now you know we were all
[44:38] preplanned by god
[44:41] hallelujah nothing happens by chance so
[44:44] therefore you're not in the time that
[44:46] you're living in by chance
[44:48] amen god knew you would be here matter
[44:50] of fact he pre-planned the time that he
[44:53] would turn the switch on
[44:56] he pre-planned the time planned it for
[44:59] many generations so that you could be
[45:01] here tonight
[45:04] that's how much god thought about you
[45:06] listen well you're not an afterthought
[45:09] you're a pre-planned thought
[45:12] you're not just a side thing and god
[45:14] said oh i guess i'll have somebody no
[45:16] he's been planning you
[45:18] he's been bringing you to this place
[45:20] he's been wiring it up for thousands of
[45:22] generations and bringing this one to
[45:24] this one and what was he doing he was
[45:26] bringing the wires together he brought
[45:28] grandpappy to grandmama amen daddy to
[45:31] mama he was bringing the wires together
[45:33] because he knew i have to have lights in
[45:36] this generation i have to have light so
[45:39] god so men can see god manifested in
[45:43] flesh
[45:44] like they did 2 000 years ago
[45:47] so you're pre-planned for many
[45:49] generations amen you're not just an
[45:51] afterthought
[45:54] hallelujah the devil wants to make you
[45:57] think you're an after a thought and or
[45:58] nobody thinks about you and nobody cares
[46:01] about you but god thinks about you he
[46:04] thought about you before the foundation
[46:06] of the world
[46:09] that's rejoicing that's something to
[46:10] rejoice about right there amen when the
[46:12] devil's speaking and you're here and
[46:14] tells you don't nobody thinks about you
[46:17] nobody cares about you you need to turn
[46:18] back to him and say god thought about me
[46:21] that's why i'm here tonight god
[46:23] pre-planned my existence
[46:28] he wired up he wired it all that i can't
[46:32] be here
[46:34] listen the devil tried to extinguish
[46:37] some of your own back forefathers that
[46:39] if something would have happened to them
[46:41] you wouldn't have been here
[46:43] but god was watching over a seed
[46:46] god was watching over a light he had
[46:48] said ye are the light so god will say no
[46:51] that one okay that cannot happen right
[46:53] now because i got a seed coming through
[46:56] there
[46:58] i got a life coming through there it has
[47:00] to come through amen maybe it was in a
[47:02] war i mean a bullet almost took them out
[47:04] or a ship almost sunk whatever it was
[47:07] but god said no it can't happen right
[47:09] now i got a seed coming through there
[47:11] god's been thinking about you
[47:14] if you get nothing out of this service
[47:16] tonight that god has been thinking about
[47:18] you and if god thought about you and
[47:21] pre-planned your comment he's got the
[47:23] prep the preparations for you he's got
[47:26] enough power to take care of you
[47:28] [Applause]
[47:30] there's enough power in the sending
[47:32] station to make sure your light don't go
[47:35] out
[47:37] [Music]
[47:39] he pre-planned you
[47:41] think about it
[47:42] you're in the gene of your father you
[47:44] didn't he didn't know you at that time
[47:46] neither did you know him at that time
[47:48] but you see that you were put in a
[47:51] bedding ground the womb of your mother
[47:52] through holy wedlock
[47:54] and then
[47:55] through the process of the birth you
[47:57] became became a person expressed in the
[48:00] image like your father
[48:02] that's the only way you can be a son or
[48:04] a daughter of god because you have been
[48:06] you have to have eternal life there has
[48:08] to be an expression there has to be a
[48:10] lighting as we talked about last time a
[48:12] lighting of the candle
[48:14] the match has to touch the wick
[48:18] if it don't touch the wick there's no
[48:20] lights
[48:22] amen
[48:23] amen so there's only one form of eternal
[48:26] life and that's god's life but the gene
[48:28] of your life spiritual life tonight was
[48:30] in god the father before there was even
[48:32] a molecule and you were nothing but the
[48:34] manifest and now you're nothing but the
[48:36] manifestation of the gene of life that
[48:39] was in god
[48:41] amen you're expressed after his word has
[48:44] come in you his life has come in you for
[48:46] what to light up this age
[48:50] to light up this age
[48:53] you are expressing god's life in you
[48:55] because now you are a son or daughter of
[48:59] god
[49:00] amen you're not you're not you're now
[49:03] made you're sitting in this church amen
[49:05] because your duty is to express god to
[49:08] this nation to people to the
[49:10] neighborhood where you associate you're
[49:12] led to let your light shine you're here
[49:15] to express the very light of god as he
[49:18] was a light 2000 years ago now you are
[49:21] his light today
[49:25] and you're illuminating and and you're
[49:27] pulsating with life
[49:33] wherever you are god knew you would be
[49:35] here
[49:38] man
[49:39] whoever you are god knew you would be
[49:41] here
[49:42] because you had you have wasn't his
[49:45] genes or his attributes you had to be if
[49:48] you air if you got eternal life then it
[49:50] always was eternal life and god before
[49:53] the foundational world knew
[49:55] you would be here
[49:58] and no matter what the devil tried to do
[50:01] to stop it he couldn't stop it
[50:04] no matter how try hard he tried to put
[50:07] it out or cut the connection generations
[50:10] ago he couldn't do it why god said no i
[50:12] have that light it has to shine
[50:16] just like the sun let there be just like
[50:18] the stars let there be i must have stars
[50:22] in laodicea that has lightened up the
[50:25] world
[50:27] to show i am still alive
[50:33] jesus
[50:35] was the fullness of god made manifest he
[50:37] was the fullness of the godhead bodily
[50:40] therefore when he came to the earth he
[50:41] was manifest in the flesh you were in
[50:43] him because he was the word and the what
[50:45] beginning was the word the word was with
[50:47] god and the word was god and the word
[50:49] was made flesh and dwelt among us
[50:52] therefore you walked with him in him
[50:54] because you were in him when he was on
[50:56] the earth you suffered with him you died
[50:58] with him you was buried with him and now
[51:00] you're risen with him the manifested
[51:03] attributes of god setting in heavenly
[51:06] places already raised resurrected a new
[51:08] life setting in heavenly places all that
[51:11] means so much nowadays church
[51:14] that means so much to us to see
[51:16] ourselves positionally placed in jesus
[51:19] christ
[51:20] i want you to understand when brother
[51:22] talking about those lights going down
[51:23] there they're not just randomly there no
[51:26] they have been placed by the power of
[51:28] god they have been put there for a
[51:30] certain purpose for a certain time
[51:32] listen you couldn't come 200 years ago
[51:34] that wasn't your time but you came in
[51:36] the age that we're living in and god has
[51:39] illuminated your life in the darkest of
[51:42] times and now you can shine the
[51:44] brightest
[51:45] [Applause]
[51:50] we are those attributes of god therefore
[51:52] we cannot live by creeds
[51:54] we cannot live by denominationalism
[51:57] we must live by the word
[51:59] because the bride is part of the
[52:01] bridegroom
[52:03] like any wife is part of her husband
[52:05] therefore we must be that word bride
[52:07] what is that word bride
[52:09] the manifestation of this hour the bride
[52:11] not a creed not a denomination but a
[52:13] living oracle of god a living attribute
[52:17] of god displaying to the world the
[52:19] attributes of god in the formation of
[52:21] the bride that's to be expressed into
[52:23] the hour that we're now living
[52:26] see martin could not express the
[52:29] attributes that we express
[52:31] he didn't have the light that we have
[52:34] amen because that was in the beginning
[52:37] the corn of wheat that had been put down
[52:39] into the ground there at pentecost it
[52:41] had to go through all the stages
[52:44] amen to where it would come to greater
[52:46] revelation you know at first when you
[52:48] put something to ground you cover it up
[52:49] how many has ever planted a garden you
[52:51] plant it there and you forget what you
[52:52] planted
[52:54] now this ain't god this is talking about
[52:56] human god don't ever forget what he
[52:57] plants
[52:58] amen but humanly speaking and so there
[53:00] ha
[53:01] it starts breaking forth and at first
[53:03] you're like is that grass or is that a
[53:05] what is that
[53:07] i i remember you know when as a kid
[53:10] dad always had a garden
[53:12] and uh so i uh my job to go out there
[53:15] and help him hoe he's like you know i i
[53:17] just for
[53:18] you know example here something like
[53:20] this would go on said you know you get
[53:21] this whole road you can go fishing with
[53:23] your buddies dude i'd get that hoe and
[53:25] i'd go to hoenn
[53:26] and he'd stop wait a minute you're going
[53:28] too fast you you're going to get the
[53:30] real plants and it began to show me what
[53:32] was real sometimes you couldn't tell the
[53:33] difference but you let that grow a
[53:35] little bit
[53:36] and it begins to manifest itself it
[53:39] begins oh that's a corn planter that's a
[53:41] tomater that's whatever amen oh that's
[53:43] just a blade of grass let me take that
[53:45] out that old bermuda that's what that is
[53:47] let me dig that out by the roots i hate
[53:48] that stuff
[53:51] it begins to manifest itself and god has
[53:54] allowed things to manifest
[53:57] he's allowed it and some of it looks
[53:59] like light but it's not light it looks
[54:01] like truth but it's not true it looks
[54:04] like it's real but it's not real but you
[54:06] let it grow a little bit it'll show you
[54:08] what it is you let it come up a little
[54:10] higher it'll show you what's truly on
[54:12] the inside why do you think we got
[54:14] people leaving the message because they
[54:16] growed a little bit and they've
[54:18] expressed who they really are
[54:20] therefore why you got people that still
[54:22] with the message because they growed a
[54:24] little bit and they're expressing who
[54:26] they are
[54:29] hallelujah
[54:32] this is why jesus would say you can't
[54:34] tear it you can't pull it up right now
[54:35] because you you'll pull up the wheat
[54:37] with the tares
[54:38] but let them grow together
[54:41] then we can tell who's what
[54:46] martin could not express the attributes
[54:48] that we express
[54:50] because they didn't have the light that
[54:51] we have
[54:54] amen
[54:56] you see
[54:58] the whole brother i'm talking about this
[55:00] he said the whole program the whole
[55:01] church of god is built upon divine
[55:04] revelation
[55:05] jesus said flesh and blood has not
[55:07] revealed this to you but my father which
[55:09] is in heaven what was the revelation of
[55:11] who he was
[55:12] upon this rock the revelation of jesus
[55:14] christ in this hour not what he was in
[55:17] another
[55:18] hour what he was what he is now the
[55:22] bible expresses it's growing in the
[55:24] bible to full stature therefore if the
[55:26] corn of wheat of christ had to fall in
[55:28] the ground so did the bride have to fall
[55:30] in the ground through the dark ages any
[55:33] grain that goes in the ground must die
[55:35] or it'll never repro reproduce itself
[55:38] and the great church that he established
[55:40] on the day of pentecost by sending the
[55:42] holy ghost had to suffer martyrdom go
[55:44] into the dirt into the earth and the
[55:46] dark ages so it to bring forth again in
[55:48] the age of luther and on down and come
[55:51] on out to full stature of the bride of
[55:53] jesus christ for this last day
[55:56] therefore the bride in the rapture will
[55:59] come forth and there is because there is
[56:02] that is all pre-planned by god and it's
[56:05] all backed up
[56:10] hallelujah amen from the beginning he
[56:12] knew every man every place who would sit
[56:15] all about it it's all been pre-planned
[56:18] god knew it would be so
[56:22] i wanted to give us confidence in the
[56:24] time than the atmospheres that we're
[56:26] living in this is all pre-planned by god
[56:30] news flash it ain't pre-planned by
[56:33] governments
[56:36] they're all in control
[56:38] you say well satan's got them all in
[56:40] control who's he controlled by
[56:44] god's working and about for a certain
[56:46] time in a certain end
[56:48] amen to bring a burning of this whole
[56:49] world
[56:51] amen but thank god we've been
[56:53] pre-planned
[56:54] and the pre-plan let me give you a
[56:56] little idea on the pre-plan before this
[56:58] world burns we're leaving here
[57:01] that's pre-planted by god
[57:03] god pre-planned our our time to come he
[57:06] pre-planned the time we was going to be
[57:08] here and he's pre-planned our future he
[57:10] said you're not going to be in the
[57:12] burning the tares are going to be in the
[57:14] burning you're going to be in the
[57:16] rapture the gathering of the garner and
[57:18] to the garner amen that is who we're
[57:20] blessed that is our pre-planned
[57:23] moment
[57:25] so what are you afraid about
[57:32] not only that
[57:33] he's going to prepare a place
[57:36] that when we leave here he's already got
[57:38] us pre-planned over there

[58:06] plates to put out he's not got one too

[58:14] angels and say angels i forgot about
[58:16] that one bring me another plate no it's

[59:42] now the vine
[59:44] so we've read about the vine the branch
[59:46] the vine doesn't bear fruit
[59:49] the branch bears fruit
[59:52] the vine gives life to the branch to
[59:55] bear fruit
[59:57] and jesus said i am the vine
[1:00:00] you are the branches therefore the
[1:00:02] branch is energizing the life into the
[1:00:06] br or the vine is energizing the life
[1:00:09] into the vine the branch is energized by
[1:00:13] the life of the vine
[1:00:17] therefore jesus
[1:00:18] has no lips tonight on earth but mine in
[1:00:21] yours
[1:00:23] amen he has no eyes but mine and yours
[1:00:26] he has no hands but mine and yours and
[1:00:29] he energizes us
[1:00:33] anybody ever been energized
[1:00:37] i think i asked this again but i want to
[1:00:38] ask him one more time who's ever grabbed
[1:00:40] a hold of a 120.
[1:00:43] somehow he's fooling with london plugs
[1:00:45] plugging something in
[1:00:46] got a little crosswalk
[1:00:49] energized
[1:00:52] hey man you you're something that
[1:00:54] something reacted on the inside of you
[1:00:56] something moved you couldn't help it it
[1:00:58] just wasn't it just was an action that
[1:01:00] caused a reaction
[1:01:02] it happened and he says the vine is
[1:01:05] energizing the branch
[1:01:07] and yet we've got branches who claim to
[1:01:09] be connected to the vine and there's no
[1:01:11] movement in them there's no response in
[1:01:13] them they sit dead as a hammer and they
[1:01:15] say they're connected they're not
[1:01:16] energized
[1:01:18] you get energized there's life inside of
[1:01:20] you there's something responding there's
[1:01:22] something going on there's something
[1:01:24] happening hey man you can call it
[1:01:26] emotion if you want to call it emotion
[1:01:28] but i call it something that's real
[1:01:32] it's about as dumb as grabbing a hold of
[1:01:33] that over there and saying that's all
[1:01:35] that's all just
[1:01:36] emotion it's something that's causing
[1:01:39] the emotion you big dummy
[1:01:42] if i got a hold of that over there and i
[1:01:44] i got it wrong got all the wrong wires
[1:01:46] and i went to a place where i wasn't
[1:01:48] supposed to touch talking about
[1:01:49] electrical plug and when i grabbed a
[1:01:51] hold of it or you know stuck a fork in
[1:01:53] it like a dummy whatever amen and it got
[1:01:55] a hold of me and i started screaming you
[1:01:58] because i just emotion
[1:02:02] that's all that is just worked up a
[1:02:04] motion
[1:02:08] why don't you get a hold of and see what
[1:02:10] it is
[1:02:14] you grab a hold of and stick your finger
[1:02:15] in there and we'll see what kind of what
[1:02:17] it is
[1:02:18] you'll find out it's something more than
[1:02:20] just emotion
[1:02:21] it's more than just me over there
[1:02:22] hollering and carrying on and jumping
[1:02:24] and trying to get free from it it's
[1:02:26] something that's got a hold of me
[1:02:28] there's something that's charging me and
[1:02:30] it's moving my muscles and it's reacting
[1:02:32] something's happening
[1:02:36] if you're being connected to the vine it
[1:02:39] energizes you it's more than just an
[1:02:42] emotion there's something that's causing
[1:02:44] it
[1:02:45] there's a power that's surging in the
[1:02:47] body
[1:02:50] you can call it emotion all you want to
[1:02:52] and when sister atlanta jumped out of
[1:02:54] there and that that seat sitting up
[1:02:56] there where brother george hamilton them
[1:02:58] are and she ran around this church and
[1:03:01] the man of god brother tim said maryam
[1:03:03] your enemy is dead
[1:03:05] you can call that emotion if you want to
[1:03:07] but tell me it was an emotion that took
[1:03:10] all the cancer away
[1:03:11] if it was i want it
[1:03:16] if it was just emotion that took the
[1:03:18] cancer i want it
[1:03:20] but it was not just emotion it was a
[1:03:23] power of god she connected into a source
[1:03:26] and it lit up her life
[1:03:30] and light came into the body and it drew
[1:03:33] back to darkness and said darkness get
[1:03:36] out of here
[1:03:41] hallelujah
[1:03:42] [Applause]
[1:03:46] something that caused the reaction
[1:03:48] the branch is energized by the life of
[1:03:51] the vine
[1:03:52] so if you are not energized if it's not
[1:03:55] something happening
[1:03:56] something moving something working
[1:03:59] it ain't got to be just a shout
[1:04:02] or dance or a run
[1:04:03] it's a life
[1:04:06] policy
[1:04:10] he energizes us
[1:04:13] brings it through us oh
[1:04:15] through us
[1:04:18] brings it through us oh i thought
[1:04:20] i thought we just needed to see angels
[1:04:23] that'd be wonderful to see angels but i
[1:04:25] don't have to see angels to know they're
[1:04:26] here
[1:04:29] with my two eyes they don't matter it
[1:04:32] matters not
[1:04:33] i know they're here because the word
[1:04:35] said they're here
[1:04:37] amen god brings the energy the power
[1:04:40] through us
[1:04:43] he's not working through angels he's
[1:04:45] working through human flesh
[1:04:49] hallelujah
[1:04:50] is christ working through the branches
[1:04:52] of his church he said listen he's no
[1:04:55] eyes but mine are yours no hands but
[1:04:57] mine and yours he energizes bringing
[1:04:59] forth his life he brings it through us
[1:05:01] whether it's preaching the gospel by the
[1:05:02] lips or seeing vision by the eye whether
[1:05:06] whether it's whatever it is laying hands
[1:05:08] on the sick it's christ working through
[1:05:10] the branch of his church every office
[1:05:13] literally electrified by his presence
[1:05:18] electrified
[1:05:20] why would he use that word electrified
[1:05:22] electrified by his presence
[1:05:26] now he would make a statement in the
[1:05:27] fundamental foundation for faith he said
[1:05:30] why what did christ redeem us for
[1:05:33] did you ever think about that why did he
[1:05:36] why did why didn't he just make the
[1:05:37] atonement make you the atonement and say
[1:05:40] now there's no need of giving him deep
[1:05:42] powers
[1:05:43] listen to this there's no need of making
[1:05:45] this man a son of god there's no need in
[1:05:48] doing that i will just ask him to
[1:05:51] believe it write his name on the book of
[1:05:53] heaven and that'll settle it
[1:05:55] but he gave us these redeemed blessings
[1:05:58] the atonement that we might operate the
[1:06:01] work of god
[1:06:05] in other words he didn't want you to
[1:06:07] just look like a light bulb
[1:06:10] he didn't want you to just look like a
[1:06:12] candle
[1:06:13] he didn't want you to just be like a
[1:06:14] robot and your name's already there and
[1:06:17] it's already happened it's already there
[1:06:19] no
[1:06:20] he wanted there to be something
[1:06:21] happening on the inside of you that the
[1:06:24] same life that was two thousand years
[1:06:26] ago can now walk off shores here in
[1:06:28] laodicean age
[1:06:30] right here in the darkest time that this
[1:06:33] life can come forth he said there's no
[1:06:35] need of giving him that there's no need
[1:06:36] to make him a son of god i'll just write
[1:06:38] his name down and that'll settle it but
[1:06:40] he gave us these redeemed blessings that
[1:06:42] we might operate the work of god by the
[1:06:47] energy of the holy spirit
[1:06:52] therefore he would say i am the vine ye
[1:06:54] are the branches
[1:06:56] the vibe don't bear forth fruit but the
[1:06:59] branches bring forth the fruit but the
[1:07:01] vine with all of its energy and all of
[1:07:04] its power can't produce it
[1:07:09] it can't listen to this
[1:07:11] it with all of its energy and all of its
[1:07:14] power
[1:07:15] it can't produce
[1:07:18] life
[1:07:19] unless the branch is willing to receive
[1:07:22] the energy
[1:07:26] so you can have a nuclear power plant
[1:07:29] right out there
[1:07:30] and it can have all the power in the
[1:07:32] world to light up this whole state of
[1:07:33] louisiana but if there ain't somebody
[1:07:36] that go run some wires over there and
[1:07:37] hook it up it's nothing but a bundle of
[1:07:40] power that's worthless
[1:07:44] and if god has all that to you just a
[1:07:46] bundle of power and you ain't never
[1:07:48] hooked up to him and his life ain't
[1:07:50] pulsing pull satan through you and
[1:07:52] giving you energy to work the works of
[1:07:55] christ
[1:07:57] lay hands on the sick
[1:08:00] cast out devils
[1:08:05] if he ain't doing all that through you
[1:08:08] what what good is he
[1:08:10] he's a god of history
[1:08:13] he's a god over there in that little box
[1:08:15] over there that just sits over there and
[1:08:16] that's all he does is right over there
[1:08:17] right over there there's god
[1:08:20] god wants to meet more than just right
[1:08:21] over there
[1:08:23] god wants to be more than just right up
[1:08:24] there god wants to be connected to a
[1:08:27] body
[1:08:28] he wants lines that can
[1:08:30] positive and negative be put right into
[1:08:32] your life
[1:08:35] to where your life all of a sudden
[1:08:36] energizes with the power of the holy
[1:08:38] ghost and no longer do you just look
[1:08:40] like a light bulb but there's light
[1:08:42] pulsating through you
[1:08:43] there's light moving through here
[1:08:45] there's energy pulsating and things are
[1:08:48] happening and demons are being cast out
[1:08:50] and you're working the works of christ
[1:08:56] see god is dependent on you as a member
[1:08:58] of his body to bring forth the fruit
[1:09:02] now you can look you can interchange
[1:09:04] these really fruit or light
[1:09:06] he's depending on you to bring forth the
[1:09:08] light
[1:09:09] he's dependent on you to bring forth the
[1:09:11] fruit
[1:09:12] if he's dependent on you
[1:09:14] if if he's dependent on us let's open up
[1:09:17] our channels
[1:09:19] amen let the holy spirit come in and
[1:09:21] energize us and free us from all fears
[1:09:24] and doubt revivals come somebody said
[1:09:26] the power is only given to the apostles
[1:09:29] i'm not in historian but i've read much
[1:09:31] history church history and i've never
[1:09:33] seen a time in all the history of the
[1:09:34] world where there was ever waves of the
[1:09:36] holy ghost that ever struck the church
[1:09:38] without a revival but what signs wonders
[1:09:41] and miracles following god healed the
[1:09:43] sick and he will continue to do it in
[1:09:45] every age where people and churches are
[1:09:49] willing to let loose and let the holy
[1:09:51] spirit take control of their beings
[1:09:56] if they're willing to let god move got
[1:09:58] to move
[1:09:59] if they're willing to let god heal the
[1:10:01] sin god will heal the sick
[1:10:04] if they're willing to let him pulsate
[1:10:06] through their life god will pulsate
[1:10:10] he'll pulsate in somebody's life just
[1:10:12] like he pulsated in david's life when
[1:10:15] that faithful that's a surge of
[1:10:16] pulsation come through him when he heard
[1:10:18] that giants challenge and he heard him
[1:10:20] scream out send me a man that'll fight
[1:10:23] send me somebody and he's like who is
[1:10:26] this uncircumcised devil
[1:10:29] and something began to pulsate on david
[1:10:31] why he had been connected to something
[1:10:34] it wasn't just connected to some dry
[1:10:36] eyed confession he had had the anointing
[1:10:38] all been poured over him there was a
[1:10:40] connection made for him and he had a
[1:10:42] connection his pulsation began to happen
[1:10:44] he's like what is this how long are you
[1:10:46] going to let him talk i've heard enough
[1:10:48] i'll go fight him
[1:10:58] got too many saws
[1:11:01] got to all the ecclesiastical garments
[1:11:03] and
[1:11:04] they look like light bulbs
[1:11:07] but they don't light up
[1:11:09] devil make the challenge they run back
[1:11:11] to the tent pull up the computer and try
[1:11:13] to find a quote about it
[1:11:15] god wants more than a quote
[1:11:18] he said well he said that what can do
[1:11:19] more for jeffersonville is thousands of
[1:11:22] lived voices
[1:11:33] live voices
[1:11:35] in other words people that's real
[1:11:38] he said in a walk up to the devil
[1:11:40] and tell him
[1:11:42] just as sweet and humble as they can be
[1:11:44] just tell him have authority over him
[1:11:51] you know what some of y'all need to do
[1:11:54] you need to walk up to that devil
[1:11:56] just as sweet as humble as you can be
[1:11:58] say you're going to hell
[1:12:05] because that's where he's going
[1:12:07] he wants to tell you you ain't got no
[1:12:09] good future
[1:12:10] well you need to start telling them just
[1:12:11] as sweet as humble as you can be you're
[1:12:13] going to hell
[1:12:15] you're going to burn
[1:12:17] you're going to lose
[1:12:19] you're never going to win
[1:12:22] do you understand what he's telling you
[1:12:24] actually applies to him
[1:12:27] he's trying to tell you what belongs to
[1:12:28] him and put on you what belongs to you
[1:12:30] you're never going to win you're never
[1:12:32] going to make it you're going to die
[1:12:34] there's gonna there's gonna be an end to
[1:12:36] you god don't care
[1:12:38] that belongs to the devil let's tell the
[1:12:41] devil there for a minute you're not
[1:12:42] gonna win you're not gonna live you got
[1:12:45] an end you got an expiration date your
[1:12:47] time is coming you're almost over with
[1:12:50] amen you might as well shut up and go
[1:12:52] back to where you came from
[1:12:55] [Music]
[1:12:56] hallelujah god wants little voices
[1:13:08] got too many sauls they're too scared to
[1:13:10] call prayer lines they're too scared to
[1:13:12] have altar calls because they're afraid
[1:13:14] to face those demons
[1:13:22] we need some davids
[1:13:25] need some real men
[1:13:27] don't preach the power out of the church
[1:13:29] preach it into the church
[1:13:31] connect them to the old new testament
[1:13:35] got too many people as we said last
[1:13:37] sunday they want to wire in an emergency
[1:13:40] stop button
[1:13:42] i had to use that again that was too
[1:13:43] good just one service it
[1:13:46] want to wire it right in with their
[1:13:48] creeds and dolphins and they want their
[1:13:49] little emergency stop button saying hit
[1:13:51] it when the motion gets a little bit too
[1:13:53] much and
[1:13:54] things begin to move too much and they
[1:13:56] they want to hit it
[1:14:00] and how did it get there by their creeds
[1:14:02] by their dogmas by their own ideas
[1:14:06] and they stopped the working of the holy
[1:14:08] ghost
[1:14:09] and they hid it so much to where the
[1:14:11] holy spirit don't even move no more
[1:14:16] but there's a way to bypass that thing
[1:14:19] matter of fact jesus bypassed it it was
[1:14:21] men that wired it back up
[1:14:23] but it came back in this hour again and
[1:14:25] he bypassed it he took it out and said
[1:14:28] we don't need no stop button
[1:14:30] we need the spirit of god moving in the
[1:14:32] body we need to flowing through every
[1:14:34] limb through every avenue after every
[1:14:35] place amen we don't know if there's a
[1:14:37] channel clogged up unclogged let the
[1:14:40] holy spirit go to moving and god will
[1:14:41] move it
[1:14:49] read this part last sunday but they
[1:14:51] talked about brother brown talked about
[1:14:52] in the reader's digest
[1:14:54] read an article
[1:14:57] he said well i don't know i can't find
[1:14:58] that article well you wasn't there
[1:15:00] anyway why are you worried about it
[1:15:02] i believe what the man said
[1:15:04] he was there
[1:15:06] so here not long ago they took an x-ray
[1:15:08] of a man praying for a sick man and
[1:15:09] found out a ray of light coming from one
[1:15:12] man not all of them but for one man's
[1:15:13] hand reflected a ray of light when they
[1:15:16] placed a piece of lead foil beneath that
[1:15:18] man's hand he said i guess you read it
[1:15:20] for yourself apparently they did because
[1:15:21] apparently nobody said they didn't in
[1:15:24] england they turned the healers they
[1:15:26] caught them loose in all the hospital
[1:15:27] and there was 80 percent more healing
[1:15:29] done by divine healing than medical
[1:15:31] cures had performed it reader's digest
[1:15:33] picked it up it was in newsweek and
[1:15:35] reader's digest they find that there's a
[1:15:37] ray of light
[1:15:39] when this man sincerely not knowing what
[1:15:41] they were doing put his hands upon a man
[1:15:43] and prayed in earnest prayer they was
[1:15:45] putting the x-ray down and found a light
[1:15:47] coming from his head god knew what he
[1:15:49] was talking about when he said lay hands
[1:15:51] on the sick and they shall recover
[1:15:55] but it only works if you've been
[1:15:56] connected to the light
[1:15:59] amen because if you hadn't been
[1:16:00] connected to the light that demon would
[1:16:02] tell you paul i know jesus i know but
[1:16:05] who are you
[1:16:07] amen but if you've been connected to
[1:16:08] that light he knows what that light is
[1:16:11] he knows where he's come for from he
[1:16:13] knows because he was there himself at
[1:16:15] one time
[1:16:18] lucifer
[1:16:23] he knows what he's speaking of the bible
[1:16:27] so he said i want to see the church
[1:16:29] pressing that place
[1:16:31] where it can come like god wants it to
[1:16:33] be
[1:16:34] amen is that what your desire is he said
[1:16:37] when god was made flesh and became the
[1:16:38] messiah
[1:16:40] then if he we can yield ourselves to
[1:16:43] become the anointed like he was we
[1:16:46] become messiahs
[1:16:49] little lights
[1:16:51] little lights that's what the church
[1:16:53] supposed to be lights little anointed
[1:16:56] ones
[1:16:58] hallelujah little anointing was carrying
[1:17:00] forth his light unto all the church ages
[1:17:04] sometimes it goes completely out then it
[1:17:06] comes back on again god's anointed
[1:17:08] another one god's messianic church if
[1:17:11] messiah means the anointed one means the
[1:17:14] kingdom if the church is anointed by the
[1:17:16] same messiah spirit it's become a lesser
[1:17:19] but still a messiah because it has his
[1:17:22] light
[1:17:23] and if it has his life it has his power
[1:17:27] it has his glory and it has his dominion
[1:17:32] because it's reflecting the same thing
[1:17:34] so it is messiah and how reflects him in
[1:17:37] his kingdom and his demand the trouble
[1:17:39] today we've organized it
[1:17:42] we've organized the church to death
[1:17:44] we've got the organization instead of
[1:17:46] the messiah light
[1:17:48] he's saying like this we've got russell
[1:17:50] lights and proselytes all other kind of
[1:17:52] lights
[1:17:54] now we got messagites
[1:17:59] but what we need is messiah light
[1:18:01] what the church needs to do this today
[1:18:04] is the light of the messiah
[1:18:07] hallelujah that is true god called
[1:18:09] messiah god called us he placed us he
[1:18:12] pre-planned us we become kings and
[1:18:15] priests in the god like jesus was a god
[1:18:17] was god's high priest we are also a
[1:18:19] priest jesus god in fullness dwelt in
[1:18:22] him shine forth the expression of god to
[1:18:24] a world for god was in christ
[1:18:26] reconciling the world to himself and as
[1:18:29] god was in christ reconcile the world
[1:18:31] himself god comes into the church and
[1:18:34] anoints himself some messiahs
[1:18:38] little lights
[1:18:42] the same things he did in his church
[1:18:44] he wants in this church
[1:18:49] i quoted it the other day but it's worth
[1:18:51] quoting again brother brother henry
[1:18:53] greene said god started his church
[1:18:55] like he wanted it now he wants his
[1:18:57] church like he started it
[1:19:01] the same power he had in his church
[1:19:05] at the beginning i'm saying it like that
[1:19:07] because he was here
[1:19:09] he defeated demons
[1:19:12] and everywhere he went
[1:19:13] if he could get somebody to believe they
[1:19:16] left
[1:19:17] now they wouldn't believe he couldn't do
[1:19:18] many mighty miracles of scripture would
[1:19:20] say but if faith would arise in their
[1:19:22] hearts
[1:19:23] and light would begin to boom out what
[1:19:25] was it faith began to pulsate
[1:19:30] demons begin to
[1:19:31] i don't like this something's happening
[1:19:35] you ever seen yeah yeah
[1:19:38] i hate them
[1:19:40] thank god we ain't got them but you ever
[1:19:42] seen roaches
[1:19:44] i ain't go ask who's ever had roaches
[1:19:48] but i've seen them different places
[1:19:52] you come in there in the night flip on
[1:19:54] the light
[1:19:55] that's why i don't stay at a hotel 6.
[1:20:00] they leave the light on for you and
[1:20:02] there's a reason
[1:20:07] that's a good one right there
[1:20:10] amen
[1:20:12] they might be with 69 tonight but they
[1:20:14] ain't worth it
[1:20:15] but anyway
[1:20:17] roaches are attracted to in the dark
[1:20:19] they come in the dark you can come in
[1:20:21] flip flip a light on
[1:20:28] mice rats
[1:20:30] every kind of vermin come in the night
[1:20:34] why because it's where they're
[1:20:35] comfortable with demons find themselves
[1:20:37] dark places
[1:20:38] and they're comfortable in dark places
[1:20:40] and dark souls are meant but all of a
[1:20:43] sudden the word can begin to pulsate
[1:20:46] and light begins to beam out and it's
[1:20:47] ascending station and it's searching is
[1:20:50] there some receiving stations
[1:20:52] is there is there it nope it's not there
[1:20:54] is there one over yep there it is and it
[1:20:56] starts pulsating and this receiving
[1:20:58] station starts pulsating back
[1:21:02] hallelujah it begins to pulsate back
[1:21:05] what's it paul say it's reflecting the
[1:21:07] light that's coming from the sending
[1:21:09] station
[1:21:10] hallelujah and it's picking it up and as
[1:21:12] it begins to pulsate and it gets
[1:21:14] brighter and brighter
[1:21:17] demons start running
[1:21:19] amen this is what god wants his church
[1:21:22] he wants his church full of lights
[1:21:29] why do you think he said that they're
[1:21:30] the cage of every unclean and hateful
[1:21:32] bird because there's no light
[1:21:35] it's darkness
[1:21:37] the demons are comfortable in the dark
[1:21:39] the same things he did in his church he
[1:21:42] wants in this church the same power he
[1:21:44] had his church becomes his dominion he's
[1:21:46] king over the dominion we're kings and
[1:21:48] priests offering spiritual sacrifices of
[1:21:50] god the fruits of our lips giving praise
[1:21:52] to him oh my there you are messiahs
[1:21:54] messiahs little messiahs little
[1:21:56] anointing anointed off of what
[1:22:00] the main one
[1:22:02] anointed off the great one oh my he said
[1:22:05] when jesus was on earth they could deny
[1:22:07] him be a messiah because he could not
[1:22:09] deny him being the messiah because he
[1:22:11] did the signs of the messiah the jews
[1:22:14] was blind that's the reason they
[1:22:15] couldn't see it see it signs that's
[1:22:17] what's the matter with the church
[1:22:18] tonight is blindness they also a world
[1:22:20] that may not see it because the god of
[1:22:22] this world has blinded their eyes with a
[1:22:24] glare
[1:22:28] jesus went about and did the signs of
[1:22:30] the messiah and the people blasphemed
[1:22:32] him and they blasphemed the great
[1:22:33] anointing when messiah how much more
[1:22:35] they call
[1:22:36] will they call them of his household of
[1:22:38] the kingdom
[1:22:40] beelzebubs and whatsoever more holy
[1:22:42] rollers holy jumpers something another a
[1:22:44] bunch of emotionalists
[1:22:48] always got a scandal name for it because
[1:22:50] it comes from the devil
[1:22:53] and they called them of his household he
[1:22:55] said man more than they if they called
[1:22:57] him that
[1:22:58] what would they call them of his
[1:23:00] household but still it makes just the
[1:23:02] same he said now brother branham jesus
[1:23:04] has a assigned a messiah how do we know
[1:23:07] what was a sign the bible said that when
[1:23:09] the messiah come he would be a prophet
[1:23:11] and show signs scripture teachers knows
[1:23:13] that moses said the lord your god should
[1:23:15] raise a prophet over me he performed
[1:23:17] those signs showing himself amen he told
[1:23:19] the woman that she had five husbands and
[1:23:22] and the one she was living with she said
[1:23:23] sir i perceived our prophet we know that
[1:23:25] when the messiah comes he will tell us
[1:23:27] all things he said i am he that speaks
[1:23:29] to you and she ran into the city and
[1:23:31] told the men and i said come see a man
[1:23:33] who's done those told me the very things
[1:23:35] that i've done isn't this the very
[1:23:37] messiah
[1:23:38] jesus said himself if i cannot do the
[1:23:41] works of my father and then believe me
[1:23:42] not if i claim to have the anointing and
[1:23:44] don't do the works of god because i'm
[1:23:46] anointed by him i must do the works
[1:23:50] well that goes for the messiah that goes
[1:23:52] for the messiahs
[1:23:58] that was the messiah for the messiahs
[1:24:00] the church here it comes john 14 12 he
[1:24:05] that believeth in me
[1:24:06] the works that i do
[1:24:08] shall he do
[1:24:11] maybe
[1:24:12] also
[1:24:14] the messiahs the representation of the
[1:24:17] messiah on earth that's why he would say
[1:24:19] in mark 16 go into all the world preach
[1:24:21] the gospel these signs shall follow the
[1:24:24] messiahs he that believeth and is
[1:24:26] baptized shall be saved he that
[1:24:27] believeth not shall be down and these
[1:24:29] signs shall follow them to believe how
[1:24:31] far to all the world to who every
[1:24:33] creature oh i'm so glad how are you ever
[1:24:35] going to rub that out
[1:24:37] how are you ever going to rub that out
[1:24:40] how you ever going to rub that out men
[1:24:42] have rubbed it out
[1:24:46] i mean brother branham talked about it
[1:24:48] and that woman that
[1:24:50] her son was off and she wrote and said
[1:24:52] he had she had a terrible sickness
[1:24:53] remember the story and he comes home and
[1:24:56] finds her well and she's he's like well
[1:24:59] mom you told me you was really sick and
[1:25:00] pointed dying you know they didn't have
[1:25:02] communication like we got today
[1:25:05] she said he said what happened you found
[1:25:07] a good doctor she said no i found a
[1:25:09] little mission down the street
[1:25:11] they came down here and they went
[1:25:13] according to mark 16. they anointed me
[1:25:15] with oil and prayed the prayer of faith
[1:25:17] amen lay hands upon the sick and they
[1:25:19] shall recover and he said mama we
[1:25:20] learned in seminary school that wasn't
[1:25:22] anointed
[1:25:26] she said well that's amazing
[1:25:28] if god could do that for me with an
[1:25:30] unanointed scripture what could he do
[1:25:32] for me with an anointed one
[1:25:36] hallelujah amen but i'm here to tell you
[1:25:39] it's all anointed
[1:25:41] the power of god the bank of heaven is
[1:25:43] here to back up every promise
[1:25:46] all he needs is a heart to believe
[1:25:48] a light a receiving station that says
[1:25:51] yes lord i receive it yes lord i believe
[1:25:55] it yes lord it's my yes lord right now
[1:25:58] [Applause]
[1:26:05] so i wonder where people that don't
[1:26:07] believe in signs and wonders fallen
[1:26:08] believer
[1:26:09] said how would you ever read that in
[1:26:11] history of church and think it ceased
[1:26:12] with the apostles
[1:26:14] so i read in the night seeing fathers
[1:26:15] nice and counseled all the ancient
[1:26:17] writers i could think of reading his
[1:26:18] looks too bad from many other ancient
[1:26:20] books all the way down to the early
[1:26:21] catholic church down in the first 600
[1:26:23] years after christ irene and saint
[1:26:25] martin columbia all of them every one of
[1:26:27] them saintly men they preached the
[1:26:28] baptism in the name of jesus christ they
[1:26:31] preached the remission of sins they
[1:26:33] preached speaking in tongues
[1:26:36] they raised the dead they healed the
[1:26:38] sick signs and wonders followed them
[1:26:40] plumb onto the dark ages through the
[1:26:42] dark ages they there's been a little
[1:26:44] more minority all the way down that kept
[1:26:47] shining the gospel light what was it
[1:26:50] messiah's one holding forth the
[1:26:53] representation of a messiah kingdom
[1:26:56] jesus never failed he did just exactly
[1:26:59] what he was commissioned to he came to
[1:27:01] establish a kingdom and he did it
[1:27:05] and that kingdom will not be moved
[1:27:09] though all hell has helped me we shall
[1:27:12] not be moved
[1:27:16] we spoke on that like this last sunday
[1:27:18] night on two kingdoms one that can be
[1:27:20] moved and one that will not move because
[1:27:22] he said all heaven and earth will be
[1:27:24] shaken
[1:27:25] amen he talks about in hebrews of a
[1:27:27] kingdom that will be shaken but also a
[1:27:29] kingdom that will not be shaken
[1:27:33] hallelujah we're seeing it right in our
[1:27:35] generation right in our time people the
[1:27:37] winds of doctrines winds of of unbelief
[1:27:40] winds of fear winds of this blowing
[1:27:42] through and shaking people off amen off
[1:27:44] the tree and shaking them loose amen why
[1:27:47] because it was dead to begin with
[1:27:55] but there are some that will never be
[1:27:57] shaken
[1:28:02] the kingdom of god comes in the heart by
[1:28:03] the power of the holy ghost it brings
[1:28:05] god's spirit upon the anointed church to
[1:28:07] perform the same signs and wonders as he
[1:28:10] did to prove that messiah is king of his
[1:28:13] kingdom he said oh i feel like shouting
[1:28:15] some of myself right now you see what
[1:28:17] messiah is messiah is the kingdom of god
[1:28:20] anointed once them anointed with the
[1:28:22] same spirit he was anointed with
[1:28:33] it goes down to the dark ages different
[1:28:35] ones that died and he says now you don't
[1:28:37] have to die to get this he said you have
[1:28:39] to spiritually die but you don't have to
[1:28:41] physically die
[1:28:43] the inside is where god gets in control
[1:28:45] of you and he presses him forward
[1:28:47] himself forward and you don't let any
[1:28:49] root of bitterness hatreds malice strife
[1:28:51] things that'll block up the channels
[1:28:53] just get all the meanness and the
[1:28:54] superstition all the unbelief out of you
[1:28:56] and every time you move out in unbelief
[1:28:58] god steps right back moves out that
[1:29:00] little unbelief god will step right in
[1:29:02] and take over move it all out he told
[1:29:04] joshua everywhere the soles of your foot
[1:29:06] have set i'll give it to you and tonight
[1:29:08] as we enter into the kingdom of god's
[1:29:10] kingdom amen god's kingdom taking out
[1:29:12] all the philistine unbelievers all the
[1:29:15] amorites all the malachites and
[1:29:17] whatsoever more throw it out of us like
[1:29:19] we did and take possession when they say
[1:29:21] days of miracles are passed you say
[1:29:23] you're a malachite get out of here
[1:29:26] if they say there's no such a thing as
[1:29:28] seeing vision you amorite get out of
[1:29:30] here if they say amen there's no more
[1:29:32] for you amen you philistine you get out
[1:29:35] of here
[1:29:37] hallelujah if they say there's not going
[1:29:39] to be a rapture you never get out of
[1:29:41] here
[1:29:43] if they say you're not going to make it
[1:29:45] satan get behind me
[1:29:47] i've already made it my life has been
[1:29:50] illuminated by the gospel of jesus
[1:29:52] christ
[1:29:53] [Applause]
[1:29:58] you're pressing then
[1:29:59] and he said from that little button
[1:30:02] you're taking over the fibers of you
[1:30:04] spreading out that little button of
[1:30:05] light
[1:30:06] when it's illuminated by the eternal
[1:30:08] seed of god
[1:30:10] a light bursts forth in you
[1:30:13] and it begins to spread out of your body
[1:30:16] taking over every fiber
[1:30:19] moving on to every place
[1:30:21] to get to such a place
[1:30:23] be going down here
[1:30:27] my
[1:30:29] we find here
[1:30:35] this is familiar but i'm going to end it
[1:30:36] with this wisdom versus faith
[1:30:40] he said if jesus defeated satan upon the
[1:30:42] faith knowing who he was
[1:30:44] he was a predestinated creature
[1:30:48] pre-planned
[1:30:51] are you ready

[1:32:03] they were saw the sunday they were

[1:32:07] church that's predestinated those he
[1:32:09] foreknew he called those he called he
[1:32:12] justified and those he justified he
[1:32:15] glorified and those he glorified
[1:32:17] predestinated

[1:32:37] god the holy spirit coming down moving
[1:32:39] performing the signs like he did the
[1:32:41] amalekite four promised he was sinning
[1:32:44] and we see all that right here where
[1:32:46] where where amen amen amen amen do you
[1:32:50] love him
[1:32:52] oh sure right here in the last days a
[1:32:55] predestinated church knowing where they
[1:32:58] stand sowed with the seed of god and the
[1:33:01] holy spirit in the church satan be
[1:33:04] careful
[1:33:07] oh did you hear that he'd been trying to
[1:33:09] tell you be careful he'd been trying to
[1:33:11] tell you you're not you're just going to
[1:33:13] make another mistake even trying to tell
[1:33:15] you what you got don't last satan be
[1:33:18] careful
[1:33:21] hallelujah because his bride is
[1:33:23] illuminated with the same power he was
[1:33:26] illuminated with and you know what the
[1:33:28] brother branham said when he hit him
[1:33:30] there on that day at calvary he said he
[1:33:32] hit about a hundred million volt wire
[1:33:35] and it shocked satan to his core and he
[1:33:37] realized oh i hit the wrong one
[1:33:42] hallelujah he said but the same power is
[1:33:45] in the bride
[1:33:46] [Applause]
[1:33:48] satan be careful
[1:33:50] you're not dealing with some
[1:33:51] denominational church you're not dealing
[1:33:53] with some denominational chicken you're
[1:33:55] dealing with the seed of god eternal
[1:33:58] life on the inside of them
[1:34:07] here i'll just read it what did satan do
[1:34:09] when he met jesus
[1:34:10] he flew into him with all the
[1:34:12] ecclesiastical force he had
[1:34:15] i knew the word also
[1:34:17] and flew into him
[1:34:19] i know the word also flew into him he
[1:34:22] said that's all the denominational dust
[1:34:24] that he had
[1:34:26] we threw he we throwed it out onto him
[1:34:29] but it didn't have any light did he ever
[1:34:31] fly off he came off a lot quicker than
[1:34:33] he flew on
[1:34:38] satan be careful
[1:34:40] come mess with the seed of god you'll
[1:34:42] fly off a lot quicker than you flew on
[1:34:46] come mess with the son of god who's been
[1:34:47] born to the spirit of god the same power
[1:34:50] energizing his life you'll fly off a lot
[1:34:52] faster than you flew on
[1:34:57] he hit that hundred billion vote wire
[1:35:01] he sends his feathers he came off of him
[1:35:04] he came out of him because that wire had
[1:35:05] bolt in it now and then he said remember
[1:35:07] satan has a wire too but no matter how
[1:35:10] nice copper the wire is if it ain't got
[1:35:12] no life it's dead it won't act might be
[1:35:14] the same wire but it has to be energized
[1:35:17] from a dynamo
[1:35:18] it has to be an energy flowing through
[1:35:20] it it has no but here's why i don't have
[1:35:22] a connection that's the reason it'll
[1:35:24] work though in a predestinated vessel
[1:35:26] that's the reason the work word will
[1:35:28] work where it's connected connected to
[1:35:30] where with the nomination no sir that's
[1:35:33] a dead socket
[1:35:34] having a form of godliness but denying
[1:35:36] the power thereof but we are connected
