[43:53] some hard places but as long as just you

[43:58] a way where there seems to be no way

[44:09] that today ask Lord you'll bless us in
[44:11] our time together this evening in Jesus

[44:19] chapter
[44:22] 6 I guess it's uh a little bit of my
[44:24] turn to be under the weather uh um got
[44:27] up this morning didn't even know if I'd
[44:29] have the voice to even speak but amen
[44:31] we're here this evening ask you to be
[44:33] praying for me men sister Ruth are
[44:35] leaving in the morning have meetings
[44:38] this weekend in
[44:39] sason with brother Kelly and so just ask
[44:42] the Lord to give us strength amen and
[44:45] also somehow to give us warmth there
[44:48] going to only going to be about the -2
[44:51] so um anyway I I'll think of you for
[44:54] while I'm there in that cold weather and
[44:57] amen Matthew 6 and verse 9 says after
[45:00] this manner therefore pray ye Our Father
[45:03] which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name
[45:07] thy kingdom come thy will be done in
[45:09] earth as it is in heaven give us this
[45:12] day our daily bread and forgive our us
[45:15] our debts as we forgive our debtors and
[45:18] lead us not into temptation but Deliver
[45:21] Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom
[45:24] and the power and the glory forever
[45:27] amen also Luke 18 and verse one said he
[45:32] spake a parable unto them to this end
[45:34] that men ought to always to pray and not
[45:37] to faint saying there was a c in in a
[45:40] city a judge which feared not God
[45:42] neither regarded man and there was a
[45:44] widow in that City and she came unto him
[45:46] saying avenge me of my adversary and he
[45:49] would not for a while but afterward he
[45:51] said within himself though I fear not
[45:53] God nor regard man yet because this w
[45:57] Widow troubleth me I will avenge her
[45:59] lest by any by her continuing continual
[46:03] coming she weary me and the Lord said
[46:06] hear what the unjust said judge saith
[46:09] and shall not God avenge his own elect
[46:12] which cried day and night unto him
[46:15] though he bear long with him I tell you
[46:17] that he will avenge them speedily
[46:20] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[46:23] shall he find faith on the Earth amen we
[46:27] let you be
[46:28] seated
[46:30] um just been
[46:34] thinking about prayer and I'd like to
[46:36] speak to you about the prayer of faith
[46:39] the prayer of faith
[46:42] uh Jesus uses this Parable and he speaks
[46:45] about someone that is not uh righteous
[46:49] or didn't fear God and didn't even
[46:52] regard man but because this woman came
[46:55] to this this judge
[46:57] and repeatedly asked of this
[47:00] request he finally amen resent he
[47:03] finally came and he finally said yes I
[47:06] I'll I'll do what you're asking me and
[47:08] and God was just Jesus was just saying
[47:10] if if this this unjust man would do this
[47:13] how much more would God do for you if
[47:17] you come and make your request known
[47:18] unto him now it isn't just coming and
[47:21] asking over and over and over and over
[47:24] but when he comes he wants to find
[47:26] somebody body that's asking in faith
[47:29] amen not just asking just just to ask or
[47:32] asking out of uh repetitiveness or
[47:35] whatever but someone who is standing
[47:37] there in faith believe in his word I I
[47:40] know a lot of times and it does speak
[47:43] about when he when the son of man cometh
[47:45] and many people put that to the very end
[47:47] when he cometh back will he find faith
[47:50] and but I believe it's when he comes and
[47:52] he comes to hear your request or he
[47:54] comes to answer you will he still find
[47:56] find you standing in faith or will you
[48:00] be in standing in doubt and disbelief
[48:02] and and not even knowing if he can
[48:04] fulfill the very things that you have
[48:06] requested but when he comes will he find
[48:09] you asking in faith and you know in
[48:11] James chapter 5 we're going to go
[48:13] through quite a bit of scriptures
[48:14] tonight but James chapter 5 and verse 15
[48:17] talks about the prayer of faith how it
[48:20] shall save the sick and the Lord shall
[48:22] raise them up and if he committeth sins
[48:24] they shall be forgiven him confess your
[48:27] faults one to another and pray one for
[48:29] the other that you may be healed and he
[48:32] says this the effectual fervent prayer
[48:35] of a righteous man availeth much now
[48:38] brother Brandon would take that and he
[48:39] said now it did not say a sinless man it
[48:42] said a righteous man and a righteous man
[48:45] is someone who has confessed his sins to
[48:48] the righteous one amen it's not someone
[48:51] that is practicing sin or or or living
[48:54] in sin but someone that if they have
[48:56] fallen as it goes on it speaks about the
[48:59] prophet Elias was a man of subject to
[49:01] like passions as we are but yet he
[49:04] prayed earnestly that he might not that
[49:06] it might not rain and it rained not on
[49:08] the Earth by the space of three and a
[49:10] half years and he prayed again and the
[49:12] heaven gave forth rain and the Earth
[49:14] brought forth her fruits so Eli Elias
[49:17] was a man subject to passions as we are
[49:21] he but he but he he he had ups and downs
[49:24] he just like we have he was not an angel
[49:26] he was a man amen and as a man we have
[49:30] our ups we have our downs we have our
[49:32] moments that we don't feel our best or
[49:34] we don't act our best or we don't do our
[49:36] best amen but that does not mean God
[49:39] cannot hear our prayers because if we
[49:41] have done something wrong a righteous
[49:43] man is going to go to him first and say
[49:45] father forgive me amen of my sins
[49:48] forgive me of what I've done wrong and
[49:50] then make his request made known unto
[49:53] God and He Man he said he he was a man
[49:55] of like passion he was subject to
[49:58] passions as we are he was just as apt to
[50:01] make a mistake as you and I are and he's
[50:04] was just as apt to do something wrong as
[50:07] you and I are amen but he prayed
[50:10] earnestly that it not rain and it rained
[50:12] for not the space of three years and six
[50:14] months think of that God listening to IM
[50:18] mortal's prayer and he said I say this
[50:20] with all true reverence there is not
[50:23] another force on Earth there is nothing
[50:25] on Earth no matter what it is what kind
[50:27] of gift it is there is nothing in the
[50:30] world that'll come ahead of prayer
[50:33] prayer is what does the work prayer is
[50:36] what does the work prayer is the key it
[50:39] is the answer Prayer Changes Things amen
[50:43] prayer is the most powerful weapon that
[50:45] was ever put in the control of human
[50:47] beings there's no atomic bomb no
[50:49] hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer
[50:52] prayer will change the mind of God yes
[50:55] sir amen
[50:57] amen prayer can change the mind of God
[51:00] did you know that it'll do it it did it
[51:02] one time in the scripture we can get to
[51:03] that in a moment Prayer Changes Things
[51:06] from Death to life amen it'll do it for
[51:09] every sinner here today it'll change you
[51:12] from death to life amen it'll change a
[51:14] sick person tonight from someone that's
[51:17] sick to someone that's healed amen it's
[51:20] that powerful prayer changes things so
[51:23] we must always bear that in mind amen as
[51:25] the scripture says to pray without
[51:27] ceasing you see brother BR made this
[51:29] statement it's qu quite incredible he
[51:31] says if you want to be an hindrance to a
[51:34] meeting just don't
[51:37] pray oh
[51:39] my if you want to be a hindrance to a
[51:43] meeting just don't pray but if you want
[51:45] to be the greatest help that a meeting
[51:48] can ever have is not
[51:51] financially amen here's the greatest
[51:53] help you can be to this meeting set
[51:56] aside an hour or two amen every day to
[51:59] pray for the meeting to pray that God
[52:02] will move to ask him Amen to come on the
[52:04] scene to ask him to heal the sick to ask
[52:07] him Amen to save the Lost he said go out
[52:10] and visit someone the Lord puts on your
[52:12] heart and bring them to the meeting but
[52:14] pray that God will save them when
[52:16] they're there if they're not saved or
[52:18] heal them if they're sick in need of
[52:19] healing that's the greatest contribution
[52:22] you can give to any meeting is to pray
[52:25] and seek God God and to help in this
[52:27] time of
[52:29] trouble come on now I'm not going to ask
[52:31] for a show of hands how many prayed for
[52:33] this service tonight but I believe we
[52:35] ought to be pray in prayer amen no
[52:38] matter what service it don't have to be
[52:39] a special meeting I know sometimes we
[52:41] get in our mind about special meeting we
[52:43] we place that word special but I believe
[52:46] every time we get together it ought to
[52:48] be special amen amen forsake not the
[52:51] assembling of yourself together even the
[52:53] much more as you see that day
[52:54] approaching every time we come together
[52:57] where it's a Wednesday night or it's a
[52:59] Sunday or whatever day of the week or
[53:01] whatever moment is it ought to be a
[53:03] special time if it's special to you we
[53:05] ought to set aside time to talk to God
[53:08] about it amen have we been asking him to
[53:10] save the lost have we been praying for
[53:12] the sick have we been asking God to save
[53:15] the prodical have we been saying God I
[53:17] need you to come in this service I need
[53:19] you to speak to my heart I need you to
[53:22] answer something that's on the inside of
[53:24] me you know how many times people have
[53:26] has that and that very service God
[53:28] anoint the men of God and sometimes it's
[53:30] off of his notes but he goes right down
[53:33] the trail and he gives them exactly the
[53:35] answer sometimes verbatim to what they
[53:37] have asked and God hears our
[53:40] prayers that's why it's important to
[53:43] pray prayer is not a
[53:46] perhaps come on now this is a quote
[53:49] prayers prayer is not a perhaps prayer
[53:52] is a sincere thing prayer is talking to
[53:56] God God Amen prayer is not get you know
[53:59] get down shut your eyes think about your
[54:01] washing or your work you're doing and
[54:03] say Lord help me and John and he'll miss
[54:06] Jones is that's not prayer that's
[54:08] repeating some words but prayer is to
[54:10] come into an atmosphere where you
[54:12] realize you're in the presence of God
[54:15] and you're moving to the deepest of
[54:17] sincerity first prayer is a
[54:20] worship is is what he showed us My
[54:24] Father which are in heaven hallow be thy
[54:27] name he started he's showing you Amen to
[54:30] Give Him worship and adoration and
[54:32] praise Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom
[54:35] come thy will be done Amen on Earth as
[54:38] it is in heaven and then once you have
[54:40] worshiped him and entered into that
[54:41] prayer then you can make your requests
[54:44] known unto God give us this day our
[54:46] daily bread but don't forget about your
[54:48] sins and your debts and and the things
[54:51] you've held against others say God
[54:53] forgive me as I forgive others yes lead
[54:57] us not in
[54:58] Temptation and Deliver Us from Evil and
[55:01] then end in
[55:02] worship begin with worship end with
[55:05] worship begin with adoration end with
[55:08] adoration is it what he I mean it's
[55:10] red-letter words it it really can't be
[55:12] argued with he gave us a very uh recipe
[55:16] that prayer should be given by amen that
[55:19] we worship Him and we give him praise no
[55:21] matter what the situation we're
[55:24] in if you if you father follow the
[55:26] scriptures and there there's a lot I'm
[55:28] going to get to but prayer and
[55:30] Thanksgiving Works hand in
[55:32] hand amen no matter what situation
[55:35] you're in that you can pray and still be
[55:38] thankful that God is allowing you to
[55:40] even walk the walk that you're
[55:43] walking cuz if you're prayer and bitter
[55:46] what Good's it going to do but God has
[55:49] allowed you to be in this moment
[55:51] therefore if God's allowed it he's got a
[55:53] plan for
[55:54] you amen prayer is the key prayer is the
[55:58] answer Prayer Changes Things prayer is
[56:01] the most powerful weapon amen so you
[56:04] know he said if we can only get quiet
[56:06] and along with god brother Mike uh
[56:09] Dexter BR brought this quote up the
[56:11] other night and I thought it was very
[56:12] good and I thought I'd just bring it
[56:13] into this if we can only get quiet and
[56:16] along with God how the do how the do
[56:19] would strengthen us he talks about the
[56:20] Dew that falls out of heaven in the
[56:22] evenings and falls upon the grass and
[56:25] and it said it takes the wilt out of us
[56:27] and it makes us fresh he said did you
[56:29] ever go into a Rose Garden or some
[56:31] Garden earlier you ever get into a hone
[56:33] honeysuckle bed early in the morning and
[56:35] the whole air it just bathed with the
[56:37] fragrance of it he said oh I love that
[56:39] he said down in my part of the country
[56:41] in Indiana I get up early and I turn on
[56:43] the switch key and I get out there
[56:45] somewhere where the Locust or the
[56:47] honeysuckles and they're blooming and I
[56:49] just sit down by the side of the road oh
[56:51] I love to smell it and I look at it and
[56:52] I see those little honeysuckles standing
[56:55] up why cuz the to do had come upon them
[56:57] and it took all the wrinkles out of I
[56:59] said oh God in the run of the day in the
[57:02] Runs run of the days if I get a little
[57:04] wilty and indifferent let me lay in the
[57:06] presence in the quietness along with you
[57:09] till I come out fresh again he said
[57:12] that's what God wants to do with the
[57:14] fragrance of prayer all over us covered
[57:17] by the blood of the Lord Jesus how fresh
[57:19] we are then before the Angels how fresh
[57:22] we are in the presence of God when we've
[57:25] laid in his presence and prayer has come
[57:28] out of our Lives to where we're once
[57:30] again not all wilty and indifferent but
[57:32] our our our our our our all around us is
[57:35] a fragrance of prayer and
[57:40] Thanksgiving Prayer Changes
[57:43] Things prayer changes as we said
[57:46] sickness to Health death to life Sinners
[57:49] to Saints is prayer brother man said you
[57:52] can laugh too much you can shout too
[57:54] much you can eat too much but you'll
[57:56] never pray too
[57:57] much the Bible said I would that pray
[58:00] men pray everywhere lifting up holy
[58:02] hands so you're never able to pray too
[58:04] much he said I believe that prayer
[58:06] changes thing I've seen death be drove
[58:09] back by prayer and life come and take
[58:11] its place I love that death be drove
[58:14] back by prayer and life taketh place and
[58:17] if you ever eyewitness of these things
[58:18] you know that what you're talking about
[58:20] I tell you it make you appreciate prayer
[58:23] more he said along this journey he
[58:25] promised to Supply everything that we
[58:27] have need of whatsoever we ask the
[58:29] father in my name that will I do
[58:31] whatsoever things mark 11:24 whatsoever
[58:33] things you desire When you pray believe
[58:35] you receive them and you shall have them
[58:37] he's give us the strongest weapon that
[58:40] there is in all the world and that's
[58:43] prayer prayer is what changes things the
[58:46] Christians don't Christian doesn't
[58:48] realize what a force he has when he gets
[58:51] on his knees before almighty God In The
[58:53] Name of Jesus Christ he don't realize
[58:56] what power that is if the people could
[58:58] only realize what's been given them and
[59:00] the rights to them anything you ask in
[59:03] my name it shall be given to you he said
[59:06] if you can appropriate the faith to
[59:08] believe for it God's word will bring it
[59:11] to
[59:17] pass now let's go through some
[59:19] scriptures in Acts chapter 10 and verse
[59:21] one there was a man in
[59:23] cesaria called Cornelius
[59:26] he was in Centurion he wasn't you know
[59:29] people at that time probably didn't
[59:31] think he was he was even could be in the
[59:34] message yet he wasn't a Jew and they
[59:37] wasn't seeing all the things what God
[59:39] were doing yet Peter didn't even know
[59:42] had to be revealed we can read it in
[59:44] later in the chapter revealed to him by
[59:46] uh by Vision don't call unclean what
[59:48] I've called
[59:50] clean but you know he makes his prayers
[59:52] a devout man and one that feared God
[59:54] with all his house with which gave much
[59:56] arms to the people and prayed to God
[59:58] always and he saw a vision evidently
[1:00:01] about the ninth hour of the day an angel
[1:00:04] of God coming into him saying him
[1:00:06] Cornelius and when he looked on him he
[1:00:08] was afraid and said what is it Lord and
[1:00:11] he said unto him thy prayers and thy
[1:00:13] arms have come up for a memorial before
[1:00:17] God that's I maybe maybe that didn't
[1:00:22] mean nothing to you come up for a
[1:00:24] memorial
[1:00:26] you know what a memorial is it's
[1:00:28] something that's built in remembrance of
[1:00:31] something amen and his prayer amen built
[1:00:34] a memorial before God that cor Cornelius
[1:00:38] was on Earth asking him to fulfill his
[1:00:42] word maybe you don't realize just how
[1:00:45] many prayers you have prayed amen maybe
[1:00:47] you prayed prayer after prayer after
[1:00:49] prayer for your lost loved one don't
[1:00:51] worry it's there as a
[1:00:54] memorial amen to remind God that there's
[1:00:57] somebody still on Earth that has Faith
[1:00:59] to believe and they're calling out in
[1:01:01] faith and I'm going to answer them in my
[1:01:05] [Applause]
[1:01:07] time your prayers are not ever
[1:01:10] unanswered there is no such a thing as
[1:01:12] an unanswered prayer before
[1:01:15] God Amen we read read in uh in
[1:01:18] Revelations about the prayers of the
[1:01:20] saints that was stored up in The Vow it
[1:01:22] was prayers he couldn't answer at that
[1:01:24] moment
[1:01:26] not in the way they wanted them answered
[1:01:27] avenge me oh god of my blood but there
[1:01:29] is a time that they will be answered and
[1:01:33] they're going to be poured out upon the
[1:01:35] enemy and God's going to see his his
[1:01:38] Avenger is going to take place his
[1:01:39] avengement is going to take place those
[1:01:41] prayers will be
[1:01:43] answered come on now your prayers are
[1:01:46] also as a memorial they're stored up as
[1:01:49] a vow and at the right moment they're
[1:01:51] going to be poured out upon your
[1:01:54] enemy Hallelujah
[1:01:56] amen hallelujah their memorial before
[1:02:00] God we can read in Acts 12 we can read
[1:02:02] about Peter amen who was throw in a jail
[1:02:06] housee you know brother Mike I'm just
[1:02:08] kind of tying this in with what some of
[1:02:10] the things he had said you
[1:02:12] know and it's true we we we want to be a
[1:02:15] continuation of the book of Acts but
[1:02:18] many times we want to look at that as
[1:02:20] the power of healing and deliverance but
[1:02:22] if you look at the book of Acts it was
[1:02:23] also a people of Prayer
[1:02:26] amen and this is where Peter was throw
[1:02:28] in the innermost prison and and was kept
[1:02:31] there but the but the but the Bible
[1:02:34] says in verse 5 let's see let me go back
[1:02:37] acts 12 verse 5 Peter was kept in the
[1:02:39] prison but prayer was made without
[1:02:42] ceasing of the church unto God for him
[1:02:45] amen until an angel came down to where
[1:02:48] he was and he fell into his and there
[1:02:50] he's guarded at the door and beside him
[1:02:53] all all all all of there and there he is
[1:02:55] am man locked in the most inner prison
[1:02:57] but listen it doesn't matter whether the
[1:02:59] devil's got somebody that's God's God to
[1:03:02] go after them it doesn't matter if you
[1:03:05] maybe your own child has been locked in
[1:03:07] the deepest darkest dungeon of Hell and
[1:03:10] Hell has surrounded themselves amen
[1:03:12] around them amen just keep calling upon
[1:03:15] God and in a moment in a twinkling of an
[1:03:17] eye an angel can go to the ark and bring
[1:03:20] them out to
[1:03:21] Freedom amen but can we find somebody
[1:03:24] that'll be standing in faith pray in the
[1:03:27] prayer faith it doesn't matter what
[1:03:29] signs look like it doesn't matter what
[1:03:31] circumstances look like it doesn't
[1:03:33] matter how bad it looks or how many more
[1:03:35] drugs are in or this that and the other
[1:03:37] whatever they're in it does not matter
[1:03:39] what matters there's about to be a vow
[1:03:42] poured out upon my enemy and my child is
[1:03:45] going to be set
[1:03:49] free Hallelujah and this is what
[1:03:53] happened and he was brought out in
[1:03:55] Freedom we can read all about it but we
[1:03:58] save a little time Romans CH 12 and
[1:04:00] verse 9 says let love be without
[1:04:05] dissimilation other words don't let your
[1:04:07] love be in a pretend kind of
[1:04:09] love pretty much what it means you know
[1:04:12] you can pretend to love somebody but
[1:04:15] that ain't the love of
[1:04:16] Christ amen abour that which is evil
[1:04:20] cling to that which is good be kindly
[1:04:22] affectioned one to another with
[1:04:23] brotherly love and honor preferring one
[1:04:25] another not slothful in business fervent

[1:04:49] just keep standing there in
[1:04:52] faith well I what about this knock and
[1:04:55] keep on knocking well I believe we ought
[1:04:57] to do that that's what we're talking
[1:04:58] about but if you read that scripture it
[1:05:01] doesn't say go get a preacher and he
[1:05:03] knock and keep on knocking for
[1:05:05] you come on it's you and your

[1:05:17] ain't careful we can turn our own our
[1:05:19] own thoughts and our own thinking our
[1:05:21] own message movement into another
[1:05:23] Catholicism where you have to come to a
[1:05:25] priest and the priest pray for you and
[1:05:27] he he he you know all that ain't what
[1:05:29] it's about sure I believe in laying
[1:05:31] hands on the sick but I believe that a
[1:05:33] little mother somewhere can Amen in
[1:05:35] faith amen cast out a devil I believe
[1:05:38] that someone under the unction of the
[1:05:40] Holy Ghost can speak a word it doesn't
[1:05:42] have to be a preacher but speak the word
[1:05:45] and freedom take
[1:05:50] place 2 Corinthians 1 and verse 8 says
[1:05:54] for we would not brethren have you
[1:05:56] ignorant of our trouble which came to us
[1:06:00] in
[1:06:02] Asia we were pressed out of measure
[1:06:04] above strength in so much that we
[1:06:07] despaired even of
[1:06:09] life that sounds like a pretty good test
[1:06:11] right there but we had the sentence of
[1:06:14] death in ourselves that we should not
[1:06:16] trust in ourselves but in God which
[1:06:19] raises the Dead who delivered us from so
[1:06:22] great a death and doth deliver in whom
[1:06:24] we trust that he will yet Deliver Us in
[1:06:27] other words we've already put our trust
[1:06:29] in God and he's already delivered us
[1:06:31] from the main
[1:06:33] death amen he delivered us from the
[1:06:36] death where we are separated from God
[1:06:38] and and we're we're away from God he's
[1:06:39] delivered so God can Deliver Us from
[1:06:41] that death he can Deliver Us from a
[1:06:43] physical death amen but we had a
[1:06:46] sentence of death in oursel that we
[1:06:48] should not trust in oursel but in the
[1:06:50] god which raised the Dead who Deliver Us
[1:06:52] from a great death and does deliver in
[1:06:54] whom we trust that he will yet Deliver
[1:06:56] Us ye also helping together by prayer
[1:07:00] for
[1:07:02] us how can I help by prayer for
[1:07:07] us amen I I actually somebody put this I
[1:07:12] don't know where I seen this somebody
[1:07:14] put this about David
[1:07:16] Livingston he's known as Africa's
[1:07:19] greatest
[1:07:20] missionary from he lived from 1813 to
[1:07:23] 1873 but he he would go into the inner
[1:07:25] parts of Africa and the native tribes
[1:07:28] and many of them opposed him and many of
[1:07:30] them threatened to even kill him and eat
[1:07:33] him uh and there was a particular
[1:07:35] particular warlike tribe that was going
[1:07:38] to kill him and everyone in the and it
[1:07:39] said they was going to kill him and
[1:07:41] everyone in their party one afternoon
[1:07:43] they was setting up camp and the Word
[1:07:46] was that these warriors were tracking
[1:07:47] them all day and they were outside the
[1:07:49] camp and they were going to attack when
[1:07:51] it got
[1:07:52] dark making reference to that evening he
[1:07:55] would write this on January the 14th
[1:07:58] 1856 he said it is evening I feel much
[1:08:01] turmoil and fear in Prospect of having
[1:08:04] all my plans knocked on the head by
[1:08:07] Savages who are just now outside the
[1:08:09] camp those who studied his handwriting
[1:08:12] said you could even see the fear in the
[1:08:14] way he wrote the
[1:08:16] letter said he wrote but Jesus said all
[1:08:20] power is given to me in heaven and earth
[1:08:22] and lo I'm with you always even unto the
[1:08:25] ends of the Earth Livingston will also
[1:08:28] write this is the word of a gentleman of
[1:08:30] most strict and sacred honor so that's
[1:08:33] the end of my fear I feel quiet and calm
[1:08:41] now hallelujah what did he do he went
[1:08:43] back to the
[1:08:45] word amen the warriors were still out
[1:08:48] there the threats were still real but he
[1:08:51] went back to his word to the word that
[1:08:54] said he is the he is with us even to the
[1:08:57] end of the
[1:08:58] world so God knows exactly where we're
[1:09:06] at Warriors didn't attack that
[1:09:09] night later the tribe would be brought
[1:09:12] to brought to faith in
[1:09:14] Christ and a couple of years later David
[1:09:17] Livingston asked the chief of that tribe
[1:09:19] said do you remember the night you was
[1:09:20] tracking my party he said yes said we
[1:09:23] had heard rumors that you was going to
[1:09:25] attack he said that's right we were
[1:09:27] ready to attack the camp and kill you
[1:09:29] and everyone else he said well why
[1:09:31] didn't you attack he said well we got
[1:09:33] close to the camp we looked and there
[1:09:35] was 47 Warriors surrounding your camp
[1:09:38] with swords in their
[1:09:41] hands and David livon was baffled they
[1:09:43] didn't have any guards or any Warriors
[1:09:45] but later when he was in Scotland on a
[1:09:47] Furlow and he shared the story at a
[1:09:49] church that had been supporting his
[1:09:51] mission a man came forward and said
[1:09:54] afterwards with his prayer journal and
[1:09:55] said look I wrote it down on January the
[1:09:58] 14th 1856 was at the night and David
[1:10:01] said yes the man said that night he was
[1:10:04] ready to him that night a group of men
[1:10:06] came to pray for you we prayed for your
[1:10:08] protection and I wrote it down there
[1:10:10] were 47 men praying for you that
[1:10:18] night come
[1:10:22] on even though they thought there was
[1:10:24] maybe around a chair gathered together
[1:10:26] in a room but their prayer took them
[1:10:28] over into Africa in the jungle and set
[1:10:31] them as a protection around a man of
[1:10:35] God do you know how powerful your prayer
[1:10:38] is sometimes the devil wants to make you
[1:10:41] think it no goes no further than 6 foot
[1:10:43] or S foot or 8 foot whatever the height
[1:10:46] of your ceiling but he want you he don't
[1:10:48] want you to know that it goes over and
[1:10:50] it places a guard between the enemy and
[1:10:53] the one you're praying for
[1:10:56] come on somebody that is what your
[1:10:59] prayer
[1:11:02] does no wonder the devil hasn't taken
[1:11:05] already some of your children and killed
[1:11:07] them in a car wreck or killed them in
[1:11:09] drugs or whatever and they laid their
[1:11:11] life to was they can't because there's a
[1:11:14] pillar of fire that is surrounding them
[1:11:17] why because there's a faithful mom and
[1:11:19] dad that gets on their knees every night
[1:11:21] and say God don't forget this one don't
[1:11:23] forget this one God I need you to reach
[1:11:25] out and touch that one I need you to
[1:11:27] move over there and your prayer is not
[1:11:29] just in your room it's not just 6 foot
[1:11:32] above you but it's going to wear their
[1:11:34] at and it's putting a fire around them
[1:11:36] and the devil can't touch them if he
[1:11:38] wanted
[1:11:44] to I
[1:11:47] remember one of my first trips I've told
[1:11:50] this before but I one of my it was my
[1:11:52] first trip overseas as far as a minister
[1:11:56] brother Danny Steam and brother Jackie
[1:12:00] Benton and when I say this I always got
[1:12:02] to mention this because some people
[1:12:03] think because a man doesn't have a
[1:12:06] certain type Ministry or a certain type
[1:12:08] way of Deliverance or a certain way or
[1:12:11] he he he preaches just simple Faith or
[1:12:13] whatever they want to call it that he
[1:12:16] that that you know just because he ain't
[1:12:18] mentioning the Seven Seals or this that
[1:12:19] and the other then he's not preaching
[1:12:21] deep
[1:12:22] things well listen prayer is one of the
[1:12:24] deepest things there is honestly but I'm
[1:12:28] not even talking about myself I'm
[1:12:29] talking about brother Jackie
[1:12:31] Benton man circled the globe I don't
[1:12:33] know how many times went to the
[1:12:36] Philippines I don't know how many times
[1:12:37] to the point they actually wrote songs

[1:12:47] Miami Florida I'd meet brother Danny
[1:12:49] steaming there and he brother Jackie
[1:12:50] would fly and meet us there then we'd

[1:18:37] everything give thanks for this is the
[1:18:40] will of GE of God in Christ Jesus
[1:18:43] concerning
[1:18:45] you 1 Peter 3 and verse2 for the eyes of
[1:18:49] the Lord are over the righteous and his
[1:18:51] ear are open unto their prayers
[1:18:55] 1 Peter 4 and verse one says for as much
[1:18:58] then as Christ has suffered for us in
[1:19:00] the flesh arm yourself likewise with the
[1:19:02] same mind for he that has suffered In
[1:19:04] the Flesh has ceased from sin that he no
[1:19:07] longer should live the rest of his time
[1:19:08] in the flesh of the lust of men but to
[1:19:10] the will of God for the time pass our
[1:19:12] life may Su suffice us to have wrought
[1:19:15] the will of Gentiles when we walked in
[1:19:17] lasciviousness and lust excess of wine
[1:19:19] revellings banquetings and
[1:19:22] ab abominable idolatries wherein they
[1:19:26] think it strange that you run not with
[1:19:28] them that are same excess of Riot speak
[1:19:30] e speaking evil of you who shall give
[1:19:32] account to him that is ready to judge
[1:19:34] the quick and the dead for this cause
[1:19:37] was the Gospel preached also to them
[1:19:38] that are dead that they might be judged
[1:19:41] according to men and flesh but live
[1:19:43] according to God in the spirit but in
[1:19:45] the end of all things is at hand be ye
[1:19:47] therefore so and watch unto
[1:19:52] prayer be on guard
[1:19:56] with
[1:19:59] prayer so we should always pray that
[1:20:01] we're worthy to
[1:20:05] escape Jude 1:14 talks about this but it
[1:20:09] goes down to verse 20 but you beloved
[1:20:12] building up yourselves on your Most Holy
[1:20:15] Faith praying in the Holy Ghost praying
[1:20:20] in the Holy Ghost keep yourselves in the
[1:20:23] love of God looking for the mercy of Our
[1:20:25] Lord CH Jesus Christ unto eternal life
[1:20:28] Psalms 5 vers1 says give ear to my words
[1:20:30] oh Lord consider my meditation hearken
[1:20:34] unto the voice of my king My Cry of my
[1:20:37] king and my God unto thee will I pray my
[1:20:40] voice shalt thou hear in the morning oh
[1:20:42] Lord in the morning will I direct my
[1:20:45] prayer unto thee and will look
[1:20:48] up I'll keep my eyes on you no matter
[1:20:52] what the answer is no matter if if the
[1:20:54] answer comes when I think it ought to
[1:20:56] come I'm going to keep my eyes on you
[1:20:59] Lord so therefore that's the reason
[1:21:01] brother man say the reason the prayer of
[1:21:03] faith shall save the sick that's the
[1:21:05] individual's prayer the effectual
[1:21:07] fervent prayer of a righteous man
[1:21:08] availeth much if he only knew that in
[1:21:11] your hand Christ gave us the authority
[1:21:14] with his name by being Christians the
[1:21:16] most powerful weapon the world's ever
[1:21:18] known prayer it changes things it'll
[1:21:21] change the mind of God it did it too
[1:21:23] after death was pronounced on a king he
[1:21:26] prayed and God told the prophet go tell
[1:21:28] him I heard his
[1:21:30] prayer the prophet came in and said
[1:21:32] you're going to

[1:22:48] to be well go eat and the woman came
[1:22:50] behind her lump on her throat and what
[1:22:52] happened they went off the platform
[1:22:53] rejoiced she said if God could Inspire
[1:22:56] that person to tell me what my life was
[1:22:58] I'll not disbelieve it no matter what
[1:23:01] happens and here she goes on and we know
[1:23:04] the story they go home and it ain't
[1:23:08] immediately it ain't in that moment of
[1:23:11] such great expectation I just heard him
[1:23:14] tell me my name told me who I was told
[1:23:17] me where I live told me this had to be
[1:23:20] God so God's going to heal me but it
[1:23:22] wasn't in that moment it was some weeks
[1:23:26] later going about everyday
[1:23:29] chores everyday living everyday life one
[1:23:33] of them making a bed one of them just
[1:23:35] cook some breakfast for their children
[1:23:37] all of a sudden she feels a warm feeling

[1:23:55] stomach here she sits down and she
[1:23:57] begins to eat oatmeal she begins to eat
[1:23:59] this she ate all the
[1:24:02] leftovers she had brother said a g
[1:24:04] gastronomical
[1:24:05] Jubilee she said I think I'll run down

[1:24:09] me and she gets down there and they're
[1:24:11] screaming and shouting going on there
[1:24:12] and here this woman had got up and
[1:24:14] started making the bed and was just
[1:24:16] thanking the
[1:24:18] lord and all of a sudden she realized
[1:24:20] this thing had fell off and it fell off
[1:24:22] she couldn't find it she's shaking out
[1:24:23] the sheet she's looking for it and she
[1:24:25] can't find it it had left her he said
[1:24:28] what
[1:24:29] happened he said the healing angel came
[1:24:32] through the
[1:24:35] [Music]
[1:24:38] neighborhood and he found at this house
[1:24:40] a woman still had Faith yes she wasn't
[1:24:44] in doubt it was weeks later but she
[1:24:45] wouldn't say man he told me who I was
[1:24:47] but I don't I guess it just ain't going
[1:24:49] to happen maybe I lost my faith no she
[1:24:52] was still in faith when he comes will he
[1:24:56] find faith and he comes into the house
[1:24:59] and he finds her under anticipation to

[1:25:55] day but the prince of this Kingdom with
[1:25:58] stood
[1:25:59] me there was a battle that was going on

[1:26:04] that battle and coming and finding you
[1:26:07] that lost your
[1:26:11] faith he done fought for 21 days through
[1:26:14] all kinds of things of of demonic forces
