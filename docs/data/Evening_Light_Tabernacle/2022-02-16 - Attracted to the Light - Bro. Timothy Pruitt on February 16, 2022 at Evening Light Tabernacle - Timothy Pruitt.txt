our hearts just help us lord i pray come and move in the mighty way we ask you for your glory in jesus name [Music] amen amen if you turn in your bibles to john chapter 1 amen i'd like to speak to you again tonight on light amen i don't know about you but i enjoy light amen i believe there's something to that amen god is light amen i'd like to speak to you on attracted to the light john chapter 1 and verse 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the same was in the beginning with god and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not there was a man sent from god whose name was john the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe now he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came into his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name amen god bless you this evening you can be seated amen he was that true light i love how the scripture says which lighteth every man that cometh into the world now whether they acknowledge that light or not it does not matter they was their life has been touched by the light amen and you know we finally of course when he came 2 000 years ago as john would say he came to the world and the world that was made made for by him and for him and through him but the world knew him not and he even came to his own his own people that he had called and called out to be a elect people a separated people we know they did not receive him but those who did receive them he gave them power to became become that same light amen you know in the book of john there's many references to light jesus being the light of the world jesus being lifted up as a light you know as a lighthouse that would give guidance through treacherous waters to warn of dangerous places but also as a light to attract the attention of the believer now we can read and i'm going to go through these really quickly but in john 3 14 he said moses was lifted up in this as a serpent under the wilderness even so much the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have eternal life for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved and he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he's not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god and this is the condemnation that the light is coming to the world but men love darkness rather than light now they saw the light they seen what the light done but they loved the darkness better than the light because their deeds were evil now if you see someone who likes darkness more than light you know there's something wrong with them there's something that they're trying to hide because they know if they come into the light that light will reveal what's on the inside or what their their deeds that they're doing he said for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither come into the light lest his deeds should be reproved but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in god also in john 8 verse 12 jesus spake again of them saying i am the light of the world and he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life in john chapter 9 and verse 1 as we had even speak about last wednesday the blind man said jesus passed by and he saw a man that was blind from his birth and his disciples asked him saying master master who did sin this man or his parents that he was born blind and jesus said neither hath this man sin nor his parents but that the work of god should be made manifest in him and he said i must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work but as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world and so he was saying this man was put in this place that the light of god could shine upon him and show amen who he really is and john chapter 12 and verse 44 it says jesus christ and he said he that believeth on me believeth believeth not on me amen but on him that sent me and he that seeth me seeth him that sent me i am come i am i am coming light unto the world and whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness and so we know amen that in there may be dark and we talked about the things that around us and and we see it getting every day it's just getting darker and darker but in this in the darkness that light can really shine it's in the darkness that light actually you know begins to really show what it is and light you know is it attracted it's a it's a drawing power amen as we said in darkness it's more it's more effective the more the darker it is the more effective light can be but a light can't be hid it has to be lifted up and this is why jesus would say i'm to be lifted up and when i'm lifted up i'll draw all men unto me i'll attract men amen unto me but i have to be lifted up now we know what he was speaking about as a brass serpent was lifted up amen between heavens and earth as a as a place to where men could look they had been bitten by serpents and and were dying from a serpent's bite they could look at that and be healed and he said i'm gonna have to be as a light be lifted up where men can look at me and they can be healed of that serpent's bite and you know we know that this light had to be lifted up so it could draw now you know you don't put a light you know in a hole somewhere in your front yard or under a bush somewhere you put it to where it'll draw or it attracts it'll it'll bring something to your home or you know whatever you're trying to do and we know but we know that this light it'll not only attract faults but it'll also attract true or it'll not only attract the true it'll also attract the faults and that's because it's the same power the same sun that draws the wheat out of the ground it also draws the terror out of the graph amen it's the light that is drawing them it's the light that is pulling them and it's the same light that draws the real draws of faults and you know but but god would use light many times through the scripture and as a pillar of fire or as an angel of light or or something that would attract men's attention he would do this to moses as moses was out on the backside of a desert and we know his story and he would turn and he was attracted you know by a bush that burned now it had to be in a place where god knew moses would see it so therefore he wouldn't put it behind a rock he wouldn't put it somewhere you know what good would it do to just have a light somewhere burning but it had to be in a place lifted up to where moses it would attract moses attention now we find out that this was the angel of god or the angel of the lord that was in the bush and and he began to speak to moses now you know moses had been in a bitter failure he'd tried to deliver the children of israel he had tried to do amen that 40 years before that and became a failure and brother adam said he lost all vision of victory he had lost all vision of freedom for the people that was enslaved by egypt and you know he said i wonder sometimes you know if the church of god knowing that god has promised to deliver the church from its sin or or from its sickness and and make us a people that the earth will hunger and thirst to be like you know but in our own he said our own human efforts and our home own human theologies and our fine churches and things and we tried to build and present to people a god of many years ago and we find out that that all failed he said but god has a real light that still shines this is still an attractant still something a drawing power amen i believe that it's not just our building that's a drawing power we got a beautiful building and we got a beautiful facilities and god's blessed us in many ways but that's not the true drawing power of the church of the living god amen it's not even the people that's a true as far as you know their standings of society and we got to have so many that's on this uh on in this government role or or this high society and they've become this successful that's not the true drawing power of the church of the living god what is the true drawing power of the church of the living god and what really holds the people of god is the light of god it's the pillar of fire that's in the midst of the church and and that's what we want in our church it's not just a fine building it's not just to find facilities and things that we've got and god has blessed us with but we've got to have the pillar of fire we have to have the true light of god that is pulling that is drawing that is calling all men unto me amen it's not even a ministry as a man can do or a man can you know it's not a man-made thing what i'm trying to say it's god anointing gifts and placing gifts in a body amen in the gospel the power of the gospel being preached and the light of god going out into the highways and the byways amen because there has to be a light in this time that we're living in because obviously there must be trills still true seeds of god out there in darkness therefore it has to be a lighthouse or light in this dark time that we're living in to draw to pull amen to hold to amen that people can come to not just because they see a good church but because they saw a good building in a beautiful place but they see there's a power there there's something on the inside of them that has pulsating it's not just just them it's not just the people it's not just the structure but there's something that's moving there's a holy ghost on the inside they may not be able to describe it but they can feel it they can they can see it amen and this is what pulled moses it wasn't a rock it wasn't just some beautiful mountain out there he saw that all of his life but there was something different that morning that he got up there was a bush that began to burn it was a light that attracted his attention and we see here you know brother baum talks about that he said but the problem is he said instead of the holy spirit leading the church he said we got off the real principles and the real thing god told us to do we left all of that and we lost our divine joy amen and now our vision is dulling and and people are not looking for the coming of the lord yet atomic bombs are hanging in hangars and and things that will destroy the world all at once and people have lost their vision of the lord he says he said see we must turn loose and let god do the things that he promised he would do hallelujah he said how can we do these things without the holy spirit you're not going to do it because you got to find church you're not going to do it because your church is full of people you're not going to do it because you got a certain man or a certain music or certain death you're going to do these things that's in the word of god and these promises are going to be fulfilled because of the holy ghost the spirit of god moving and attracting amen the people of god amen we can't do it without the holy ghost i don't even want a service without the holy ghost i don't want to day without the holy ghost and the spirit of god and the pull of god in our lives i want that to be even like tabernacles drawing amen as the power of god moving our remits hallelujah not just to get together not just a few times and some good music i want the power of god drawing us the holy ghost pulling us the light of god pulling us that is the attraction on the mount you mean it's a burning bush it's not what we can do in our own learning and our own abilities he said see fire brings attraction amen usually the holy spirit when it comes in the manner of fire it attracts the attention of people he said when moses turned aside considering this burning tree that would not burn up and out of him spoke a fresh vision by the angel amen you got to have the light to get a fresh vision you got to have the spirit of god to get a fresh vision he said watch faith begin to take hold all things are passed away but now moses has a new vision he has a revelation he has an experience he has met god he's talked to him face to face not only has he read about it not only has he got what his mama told him but now he has his own experience now he's been attracted by the light and the light has gave him a new vision oh hallelujah now that's why we see churches dying because the light has gone out therefore with the light going out amen amen the vision is dulling in and they don't see a god who could do things like he used to do it and still do them healings still take place and deliverance still take place and the power of god still change people therefore they begin to make excuses well mercy's over and this and that and the other amen what is it they've tried to make but instead of asking god to say lord we need a real birth we need a real uh rejuvenation of the spirit of god amen they begin to make an excuse why he ain't there amen but now not only did he have what he read and what he heard from his mother and from maybe somebody else but now he had a personal experience he said that's what the church needs tonight is to stop studying so much theology and get down to an altar and pray until a personal experience burns into your heart and it burns out all the dullness and gives you a new vision hallelujah let's not he said let's take the other fella again another place moses on the backside of a desert just as full of doctrine as he could be he knew all the ins and outs he could even teach the egyptians some of the smartest people of that day but one day he saw something in a fire and it attracted him and that's what we need today as a church on fire to attract [Applause] amen not a dead church with cold creeds and dogmas and and living on yesterday 50 years ago fire we need a fresh fire the same fire that fell on the day of pentecost can fall in this day and hour that we live in and give you a new vision [Music] and you can see a god of not just history but a god of today and when the fresh holy spirit falls upon your life it'll give you a new vision and all the coldness and all the dullness and all the things that were in the past now you can see now a true living god because of the light amen he said see it's a church on fire that'll attract some of these moses amen some of these moses and attract some of these sinners it takes a fire to give an attraction you know what attract your attention right quick is somebody come in that door and start hauling fire amen everybody be up and about and wondering what's going on amen even those that are sleeping and wake up amen why because they heard one word fire one fire he said that's what we got to have is the fire of the holy ghost it'll attract the believer to see something hallelujah amen amen he said i remember an old friend of mine named ben pemberman he said he's quite a fellow over in saint louis he had a tent meeting going down there and nobody would come to it so he took off running down the street and he's beginning to scream fire fire fire and running pointing down towards where his tent was and up the street he went throwing his head up as high as he could and screaming acting like a lunatic and had a tent meeting up there everybody began to run behind and wonder what's going on running through the fire he said he got all them people in the tent he said well while you're here let me preach to you about some fire some holy ghost and fire and he started preaching just as hard as he could do he said the best thing that'll attract a wayward man is the holy ghost in fire that's the way god did it before and that's the way god does it now [Applause] amen so instead of preachers hollering theology and theology and theology and mechanics and mechanics and some some of you start hollering fire fire we need the holy ghost and fire we need the power of god back in our churches we need to move without sin moving out unbelief we need the days of ananias and fire come on somebody ain't gonna burn out all the coldness and the and the amen if we get some preachers hollering that a little bit it'll change some attitude didn't think he could do it he didn't try it on his own with his doctrinal standpoints and it didn't work but he got to the fire and the fire said take your shoes off i know you're prince in egypt but you're nothing in my sight gets off your shoes amen you're on holy ground get rid of all that stuff you got in here oh my and he heard a sound oh my that's what happens when you get in the fire when you come face to face with this holy fire of god amen it'll kick off the wrong shoes it'll kick off the wrong clothes it'll replace them but it'll kick off the wrong clothes it'll kick off the makeup it'll kick up all the way because you might be somebody to some society but with god you're nothing but a piece of dirt but he wants to put some real life on the inside of you and quicken that seed on the inside of you but it takes fire amen i preached on this not too long ago about being born in the fire of those big trees over in california it puts off those seeds and they fall into the ground amen but it takes a fire to actually open up that seed to where this life can come out of it oh now we know what's wrong with a lot of churches they ain't got their services hot enough they ain't got the power of god moving they don't question a bunch of man-made theologies and creeds and dogmas and worried about somebody else's church and worried about what's going on over there what you need to do is worry about what's happening in your own church and say god i want the fire of god to come in my life to come in my church that seeds can open up and bring forth life it takes fire amen moses didn't know what he didn't know about all these other voices no more he doesn't heard the real voice and the voice said i've heard the cry of my people i've seen their tasks their problems and their situation the taskmasters i remember my promise and my covenant now that was something scriptural and he says he said see he says a real a scholar may hear about there's no such a divine healing and a whole bunch of work up but to a real believer they won't listen to that they'll listen to jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever they'll listen i'm the lord that heals all thy diseases but moses he he now is in the presence of the fire and all these other voices the voices of his past the voices of his past failures the voices of egypt was now all dead and now he could hear the voice of god and the voice of god was speaking it was a pillar of fire it attracted his tension he said this great theologian he had run with all of his theological training and all of his understanding from his mother from his mother but now the word itself came to him and although his mother had thoroughly instructed him what to do and what he would do and what god had raised him all this knowledge as good as it is it is good but yet it has to be set off now follow me just a minute it has to be set off that knowledge is just only mechanics mechanics ain't what runs an automobile the dynamics is what runs it this is a quote now mechanics don't run the church hello somebody mechanics don't run the church it's the dynamics it's the holy ghost that gets into the word it's not a seminary that teaches you all the theology and all the greek interpretation but it's the dynamics of the holy ghost in there to set you a fire to bring to pass the word of god and make it live exactly what it was supposed to do in your hour not just the mechanics but the dynamics it takes both the word and the spirit they're the one that gives a life but god has promised for the hour looking for we need to start looking for it to be fulfilled you must look at him you must look to the lie there must be the word begin to illuminate you not just an illuminate your mind that's what people love they love their minds illuminated well i got more to i know more today than what i know but it ain't known by the mind it's known by the revelation in the heart because your mind will lie to you you might you know you you'll have mind battles you say well brother timothy i thought i had the holy ghost and i still got mine battled well yeah you're going to have them because you still got a mind you still got the human elements you still got things that are there and you're as much as your soul is sealed by the until the day of your redemption your mind it'll still wander it'll still have but the problem the difference is now there's a control tower on the inside and it sees a thought that comes in and it says nope i'm gonna reject that thought and you might have to reject that thought a hundred times a day for a whole month and it's tormenting and coming and coming and coming but there's something on the inside of you that's pushing it out pushing it out that's not just mechanics that's dynamics that's the dynamics of the holy ghost amen it'll push out those say and push out those thoughts you're going to have them lord i i don't even want to put up here today our thoughts as ministers but i wouldn't want we all got thoughts listen just be honest with you you have something that goes on in your life somebody does you wrong your first thought is not to hug their neck is not to shake their hand it's not to even give them a smile that's not your first thoughts there'll be thoughts that wells up in you and you want to wear them out you want to take uh something and just beat the tar out of them because they did you wrong but something's different maybe the old man would have done that you got you got something you to beat the tar out of somebody because of what and they did wrong they did wrong they did wrong it doesn't change if they did wrong they did wrong but what changes is what the response is it might come into your mind but there's a control tower says no that's not what you do anymore amen get on your knees and pray for them and and i'll take care of it amen but you have to reject those thoughts all the time amen see this this is what moses was he had all kinds of thoughts don't you think he had enough time to think about all of his failures and all of his mistakes and all of his problems and all those things and then he meets the fire of god and god comes down and reveals himself in a personal way and he still walked away and he still had thoughts he still had thoughts of failure no doubt thoughts of what am i doing but something on this i know i meant something real this couldn't have been a man-made thing i didn't do this on my own i met somebody and he told me go down there and tell pharaoh let my people go that's the difference in your heart now when you meet those things you begin to realize no i met somebody and when i met somebody he changed me on the inside and i'm going to go down there with the word of card and i'm going to speak to that thing and say let my people go this is where moses was at attracted by the light he said see the day that god had promised these things we're now enjoying these things we're seeing the world is laughing at this great momentous power the holy spirit that can change a sinner's heart they can give a lukewarm church member and take him and give a testimony and set a church of fire from where he came from out it's the dynamics that got into the word it's the light that shine it was the light that attracted you know it's paul that was attractive or actually his name was saul at the time but he was attracted by light and i just want to take his testimony for a minute acts chapter 26 and 13 he says at midday o king i saw in the way a light from heaven and above the brightness of the sun shining around about in other words it was brighter than the sun yes it blind it was so bright it actually blinded him so it was something something to shine and round about me and them that journey with me and when we were all falling to the earth i heard a voice speaking unto me saying in the hebrew tongue saul saul why persecutest thou me it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks and i said who art thou lord he said i am jesus whom thou persecuted jesus here he thought he was doing the lord's work here he thought he was taking the light and he was he was putting to death these heretics and he was shining light but god was coming to show him the greater light the greater light had come and he he attracted him by light pulling him off his high horse pulled him off of his position and who he thought he was i i am the you know i'm the great saul i'm the great man of god i've been commissioned to go down here and put these people in prison i've been commissioned to do this why what is that pow off the horse that comes and he laid on the ground and he's saying lord who are you and he says i'm jesus whom not persecuteth and a voice begins to speak speak to him he said but rise stand upon your feet for i have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make them minister and a witness both of these things which i have seen and of those things in which i will appear unto thee delivering thee from the people and from the gentiles unto whom now i send thee to open their eyes oh hallelujah and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god that they may receive forgiveness of sin and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me hallelujah i'm thankful to be one of those amen who was turned from darkness into life from the power of satan unto god but god had to knock him off his high horse who he thought he was who he thought you know he's a lot different than moses moses was the opposite he was out there hiding here's saul the other direction but god still attracted him by light the gospel light is always the attraction of a true believer it's what attracted you to church tonight a light amen the gospel light is what brings you to church on a wednesday night or sunday morning or or special meetings or or different places you want to go and different different services brother and we'll talk about this he says he talks about the light begin to dim and people's interests and things he said where is the interest of the nation in the day for the salvation of the lord jesus christ for the light just some few loving will come anymore just some few loving others it's too hot to sit in a building like this in the afternoon for an hour and listen to a gospel sermon but they're willing to watch a television or a movie picture something like that even if it's right out in the bowling sun or a hot race of some sort where your treasure is that's where your heart is he says i'm so thankful that there's some that really love the lord jesus and will come out on a hot day or any day to listen to the gospel he said because in my opinion the gospel never loses its attraction to the believer hallelujah you say well i've been going 20 years it never loses its attraction it never loses its drawing power you might be 20 years 40 years or down along the journey you ought to be more in love than god than you ever was you ought to be more on fire for god than you ever was listen if you have felt yourself dimming down i encourage you god by the power of god tonight get another log get another promise put it on that fire it might not be nothing but a spark right now but if you'll put another log on it another promise of god on it and begin to let the winds of the holy ghost begin to blow it'll burst up in a flame again and it'll set your family on fire it's always been the attractant the gospel it's the light he was saying another way the supernatural has always attracted the attention of the believer the supernatural the gospel it is in its simplicity it's the greatest drawing card the world has ever known jesus said when he was here on earth if i be lifted up i'll draw all men unto me black white yellow brown whatever color whatever race the gospel still holds a center of attraction to every man and every woman it's the light we would see in proverbs 4 and verse 18 it says the path of the just is as a shining light the path of the just is as a shining light and that shineth more and more unto perfect day did you hear that more and more so if you've been going 20 30 40 years you have no excuse according to the word of god for your light to be dimmer than when it was when it first started because if we're not going by man-made light what was only if truly what was born on the inside of you it will not dim it will not go down it will not diminish because it's not a man-made light it's a god light it's an eternal life and it'll keep burning it'll keep burning he said onto perfect day it'll actually get brighter and brighter and brighter it'll shine more and more and more the greater so if your light's dimming down you might ought to check your light and see if it's truly a godlight if you say well well brother timothy we all got ups and downs yeah but the light don't change we all go through valleys and darkness and valleys and hills and yeah but the light don't change amen the light that is it isn't going to go out but it's going to shine brighter and brighter that's why you ought to be looking for a new and fresh experience every day not just when you come to church not just once a month or once a year or new years every day god if i don't do anything more today i want to love you more and serve you better i want my fire to grow brighter i want my light to grow brighter amen the darker it is i want it to be because it says in the very next verse it says the way of the wicked is as darkness and they know not at what they stumble another translation would say the ways of the right living people glow with light it glows with light amen amen and the longer they live the brighter they shine amen so they've got to get kind of throws a curveball and some of you people that wants to say well i'll tell you what you just serve god 40 years and see where you're at you ought to be brighter it ought to be more coming to your light you ought to be building it up and saying god i want to do whatever i can for this light to shine out as far as it can shine and as bright as it can shine amen so now but we know that there is a false light and there is a true light but both attract amen both have a drawing power but one glows and one shines now you know it took me a while to get to kind of get an understanding because brother brandon would use this term he says the gospel glows the world shines and we just sing the song tonight shine on me lord shine on me amen but what it's speaking about is actually the glow is not just a reflection of light it's it's an inward power it's not you know you can take a mirror and you can reflect this light but it wouldn't have no heat in it it wouldn't have nothing to you know no no self preserving light amen if you break the mirror the light's gone that's inside of it but a glow has an inward power there's something because see god was not just interested in him being the light he wanted to also give power to you to be sons and daughters of god in other words he wanted to light your life up that you could also be a light amen amen sir it's a it's also a glow means it has a radiant heat it has a life inside of it one is a reflector of another light and one is a maker of light the word is reflecting amen the world is reflecting another kingdom but the children of god is not just reflecting the kingdom the kingdom is living on the inside of him and there is a globe there's amen there's something moving there's a power that radiates from the inside of them this is why in romans 12 and verse 11 in the amplified bible it says never lack and seal an earnest endeavor but be a glow and burning with the spirit of god amen our lives should never lack and seal our earnest earnestness about this gospel but our lives should always be a glow because it's not a temporary light and darkness can't do nothing about it it's going to burn no matter how dark it gets it's going to burn no matter how gloomy it gets this light will burn no matter how hard the trial you go through and the darkness you face and the situation and the sickness it'll still burn out and blow and glow out and give a light to a dying world it's not just an outward shine but a glow a burning with the spirit of god you know you can look over there let's see i don't see one that's very visible right now but there's all over here there's electric plugs electric plug can look like a plug and have the characteristics of a plug have the screws in the right place have the cover just right and all the counts look like electric plug but won't give power to nothing unless there's this hook to a source it has to have it's got to be hooked to a source and then you can plug a vacuum cleaner in it and it'll run you can plug an iron in it and it'll run you can plug a blow dryer in it and it'll run but you can plug it in there all day long and if it ain't connected to the source or there's some issue somewhere it ain't going to do what it ain't going to do nothing it'll look pretty it'll look right it'll be just like man this should work and this is where the church is looks like a church smells like a church feels like a church in some ways it's got some attributes of being a church the cover's just right looks looks looks pretty but then it ain't connected to a source therefore it can't give power there's no power there amen until it's hooked over to a source of electricity it just it just looks right but once it's hooked power begins to search for and it'll begin to power anything that's plugged into it same with the church amen you can put a druggie in there and it'll get attached to that same power source it'll begin to move in parts and places that that man had never experienced on any drug before he had never experienced on any alcohol before he had never experienced none of that before why it's plugged into the same source as the power of light comes from that said let there be light you know there's a thing called fool's gold it looks like gold it even shines and glistens more than gold but you can buy a bottle of water with it it has no buying power it's worthless ain't even worth the stuff that you can have a glob over that big and it's worth nothing but it looks great shines great there's been a lot of people through the years been been shocked by what they thought was a fortune and they find out it ain't nothing and they it's gonna be a lot of people like that on that day thought they had a lot of gold a lot of glistening a lot of glow and a lot of a lot of glitter and brother branham talks about this he says he said i i was up there with brother sophomore one time in a mine and i got there and dug out a bunch of what looked exactly like gold but the only way you can tell it isn't gold it shines better than gold it shines gold doesn't shine it glows that's why it's called fool's gold it's not even worth as much as the rock that's in it it's called iron pyrite scientists talk about it how that the waters and the acids couldn't get through it and to bring it to a place that it could become gold did you hear that so it shines better but it don't have the same chemicals it looks better but it don't have the life or the buying power you can take a little almost you can't even see a little piece of gold dust and by way more you can buy maybe a bottle of water i don't know how much a piece of gold doesn't be worth but it's worth money and the way i understand gold's going up and worth a fortune right now amen even more more than ever but you know you could take that big old honking you could barely carry it in and you'd be so proud of it it's shining it's glistening and it's heaven you're just having a good time and you put it and place it on the counter and they tell you it ain't even worth a bottle of water this is where people are in their lives what they think is gold they're gonna find out as fools go what they thought they could buy eternal life with is going to be worth nothing when it comes that day i want something that glows i want something that's got power in it i want a gospel that's got life in he said he said i've been a prospector you know fool's gold shines brighter and real gold it glitters everything glitters is not gold gold doesn't glitter it glows the hollywood it'll glitter why he says but the gospel glows with humility hollywood shines with his great churches and his psychological teachings and and educated ministers who can speak and use their nouns and pronouns and everything exactly right but in humility the gospel of jesus christ glows to the glory of god amen he would say in another place he said we we need not to shine we need to glow amen we need to glow with the power of god glow with the gospel of god let the power of god be moving inside of us amen amen let it let it move he said but the problem is the church is losing their identification you come on he said we come on wednesday night well some of us others stay home at that time who loved who loved sushi or lucy was going on all kind of other worldly things kind of entertainments keep you away from church he said we've lost it long ago our seminaries our schools bunch of rickies with a lot of theology and entertainment and a lot of psychology we took dress we took this we took that a lot of glitter but no glow he said we let them come over amen and you know we go over on their ground he said but what we need to do is let them come on our ground where the real baptism of the holy ghost is glowing in the power of resurrection it's not trying to build a church like this it's not trying to be able to have a pastor like that or to cooperate something with the world they shine with hollywood but the gospel glows with power and the eagle will see it every time they don't look for a shine they look for a glow they look for the power on the inside not some little glitter and glamour you know and carry on we want something with life on the inside of it you know sister anna paris actually brought this to my attention she's good at that i don't know if y'all know sister allen yet or not she's moved to our church with the paris family lovely sister she got a lot of facts she studies a lot apparently don't mean to embarrass you but man she's she's full of good facts and last wednesday i was preaching on light and she googled it it was brought to my attention about bugs because i was talking about the windshield or the lights on your car you'll go home and there'll be a lot of bugs come out right they're looking for something and i want to bring this right in here because we're looking for a gospel that don't glitter or a false light we're looking for a glow a power but a bug don't just go to a light to die you know a bug don't fly out of the forest tonight so you know what good night to die no no actually it's a theory you know it has to be a theory because apparently you can't ask a bug and this is really what happens but scientists that have studied this said the theory is there's many of them that feed on nectar from flowers which are known to reflect ultraviolet light some light bulbs give off a small amount of ultraviolet light potentially causing hungry bugs to mistake a bulb for flowers that's powerful right there because you begin to realize people don't go to places they go to to die they go there because they're attracted to a light but they don't realize it's a glitter and not a globe therefore i mean you know a person don't join a methodist church or any other kind of denomination because there's some evil person they join that because they are a hungry person they're hungering for the thing even a person many times don't don't become an alcoholic or a druggie because they want to be an evil person and steal and pillage and destroy but no there's something on the inside of them a god-given thirst and they go to the wrong source amen this is where we find people even message ranks that have found themselves amen disillusioned and things they didn't go there to a false light because they were a bad person they went there amen because they were hungry hallelujah but if you are hungry tonight there is something that'll feed you there is a real life that'll give you strength that'll give you nourishment that'll bring you back to where you belong but it won't glitter it won't be maybe the best dressed people on the planet you know they got their they got their tie just right and their clothes just right and they're dressed to the tens and they got their cuff links on and man they can dress the part but inside of them they're dark and a demon for ever every cage of every unclean and hateful bird you didn't go there because you was a bad person you went there because you was hungry but there is a place to be fed there is a true light amen there is something that can move and take take that pain away from you they can take that discouragement away from you they can take that hurt away from you they can take those saying there is a true light and it glows with the power of almighty god that's why we got to preach a gospel that not only amen not that we we're not interested in one that can just produce an alcoholic anonymous meeting and you just go and you just continue on as you are no we got to have a gospel that has such a glow about it that there's a power of god on the inside that it ain't going to let you remain the same but it's going to change you it's going to mold you it's going to make you amen it's going to show you the light of the word amen he said see when people are hungry they'll eat from anywhere if a child is starving or a person is charmed they may have used to eat from a fine table but they get hungry they'll eat from a garbage can he said but when they're hungry they'll eat somewhere he said that's why i think real true ministers of the gospel ought to be up and going ought to be giving the people the right things meet and do season a gospel that lives a gospel that glows a gospel that has strengths there is a true light there is something with life that will attract and feel the believers hunger and heart there is a gospel that a pool there's a light that'll pull the believer it was a light that was walking down a dusty road and up on the hill was a woman had a blood issue what attracted her that light it was all kind of people saying false prophets saying this that and the other but she saw through all of that and she saw the true light that was being lifted up amen there was many that that we could go through the lepers and the blind and the halt and lane amen that would find real true attraction when nothing else could help them they'd went to false lights they'd went to places and they just cast them out and put them out and they was out on the streets begging but all of a sudden a real light would walk by and this light was bright enough it would light up a blind man he even a blind man could see it and he'd begin to scream out god have mercy on me move on my heart and my life amen brother brown will you go listen to that message i've been trying to get to it but what is attraction on the mount amen he said what was it it was the word being manifested being fulfilled that attracted the believer what attracted us to where we are today is the word being fulfilled it's the word being made manifest it's the word coming to free fruition in our lives brother ron spencer made one of the most amazing statements at a youth camp one time he said if this message don't produce the same overcoming life in me that it did in william branham i don't want nothing to do with it there has there's a power there there's an attraction not just to a miracle yes that does attract but it was more than that it was the word behind the miracle the word that spoke of it and said it would be and it attracted our attention and that's why we're here and we're looking at it still looking at it even past all the chaos and all the critics and all the people wants to come up and say this was wrong and that was wrong i'm not looking at none of that my eyes is on the light and this light is glowing this is where the people were as he was coming off the mount of olives on a white donkey walking down the hill a whole bunch of people were screaming frantically pulling palm leaves off the trees throwing their clothes in the road screaming hosanna to the son of god that comes in the name of the lord what had brought them there the light had brought them there the word being manifested brought them there the anointed messiah the hour was walking down was coming down the road he said that what was the attraction up there on the hill it was god making history god fulfilling prophecy that's what causes an attraction it's a light shining amen on a darkened scripture and all of a sudden it's fulfilled and you're looking like wow it just happened where are we at and it illuminates it's going to illuminate to some people when they see bombs dropping and all of a sudden words being fulfilled but it's going to be too late don't wait till it's too late to come to the light there is a true light he said sure it causes an attraction of course it brings us the vultures it brings the critics but it also brings the eagles hallelujah i'm one of them i'm one of them they come together to find out what's going on some come for curiosity some come to find fault some come to criticize all kinds together but as we said make believers believers unbelievers what's on the mountain prophecies being fulfilled what's happening in our day prophecy is being fulfilled what is the attraction that's going on in tonight why are you here because prophecy is being fulfilled light is dawning on scriptures and it's like a roman candle being blowed out and light's coming and light's coming the light's coming why you still believe the message of the hour brother timothy because it's light it glows it has a power that i haven't found anywhere else it's a power that'll keep me in my darkest hours it's a power that'll keep me when i'm going through the darkest trial of my life and i can say like job though god slay me yet i'll trust him why are you here why are you sitting here on these pews tonight because of light you've been attracted not to a building not to a man not to some polished up scholar not to some man that could put all of his words together and it flowed just like just perfectly but you're seeing scripture being fulfilled and light is flashing and it's moving like never before and light is getting greater and greater and greater and as i said last wednesday don't worry it's dark but right behind the darkness is the greatest light that's ever shined the eternal brightened and shining day that'll be an eternal day never to be dark again oh my could you imagine breaking in that day and never having another mind battle never having the word fear enter into your mind anymore or the feeling of fear or the sensation of fear or the worry and the dread that's what we're going to but yes it's getting darker but it's getting darker because light is pushing it's getting darker because light is dawning and it's pushing against the darkness and darkness is trying to hold it back but it can't do it it can't hold it back amen just in case you thought i was crazy the other wednesday i found something this this evening amen in the church age book he said through the dark ages we'll see children of the flesh persecute and destroy the children of the spirit though both claim one father even in the case of ishmael and isaac the darkness of spiritual corruption will deepen and the true light of god will fade until number wise it'll grow so faintly yet the promise of god will hold true the light shineth in darkness and darkness can do nothing about it hallelujah amen they can criticize they can do whatever they want to but they will never can somebody say never never put out this light this light is shining and it's going to shine like a lighthouse until that last soul comes home and when that last soul comes off we're gonna step under that glorious life are you ready to go with me are you ready to rise out of the muck of this whole world get past all the fear and all the things that around us and enter into that glorious light the glowing of the gospel of jesus christ let's stand to our feet why are you attracted because you're as hungry how many is found in to be the nourishment you needed oh my your face out in the desert somewhere all of a sudden you saw a light and moses found him to be exactly what he needed critic i found this message to be exactly what i need if you don't need it i'll take it that ain't what you want and what you want looking for go do your own thing and have a good time while you're doing it but as for me and my house i found the light that i need hallelujah amen let's buy our heads the light shineth in darkness and darkness can do nothing about it that's got to make every devil in hell mad i like to just tell it again darkness you can't do nothing about this light this light will always shine you can line every devil up you can bring all the darkness you want to bring but this light will continue to shine oh my how many is glad you seen that light yours your ship was out on that old dark sea but all of a sudden you saw a glow the lighthouse the lighthouse shining on me won't you move to that lighthouse tonight there's safety there this lighthouse i'm speaking of tonight is safety it'll bring you through every storm it'll bring you through the loss of loved ones it'll bring you through every sickness this light will never go out hallelujah i wonder how many would just say lord i want to be like that scripture in proverbs i want my light to get greater i want it to get greater lord build it up build up that fire in me god let that revival just build and build and build we don't have to go out of this whole world was barely a flicker we can go out of here it was a great flame of god burning lord jesus you see the hands lifted all over this building may the fire of god be built up in every life lord whatever it is we've allowed to come in lord in the darkness to cover but lord may our lights be lifted up even the greater lord bright burn even the brighter father lord that we can attract that last seed home because lord we're tired of this world tired of the darkness lord we're tired of the sickness and things around us and the problems and the situations even so come lord jesus let that light dawn that eternal bright and fair day lord we love you jesus bless your people tonight take this little sermon lord just help us lord to see the good things in it lord and the truth of your word feed off of it father lord if there be someone lord has been disillusioned and been battered or they got attracted to the wrong light but god they want to turn to the true light lord of the gospel of jesus christ may they realize there's there is a place they can find safety there is a place lord that they can find healing and deliverance lord they can find the things that they're hungry for there is a there is a god who's able to feel and every heart's desire there is a word lord there's a gospel in jesus name amen do we have the words to the lighthouse i don't even know if we have the the key but
