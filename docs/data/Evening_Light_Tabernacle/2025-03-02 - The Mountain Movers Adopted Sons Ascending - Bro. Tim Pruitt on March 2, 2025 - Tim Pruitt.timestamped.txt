[51:45] Deliverance needs of encouragement
[51:48] strength Lord needs oh God the needs of
[51:52] your people there are many some needs
[51:55] healing and deliverance in their body
[51:58] they're tormented by the devil having
[52:01] come and tormented their flesh and
[52:05] poking them with the thorns and the
[52:07] thistles that this whole earth will grow
[52:10] oh God we're asking that you would be
[52:14] the god rich in Mercy today as we know
[52:16] you are that you'd be merciful
[52:19] personally to each heart there are souls
[52:22] that needs touching Lord that maybe have
[52:25] sat here serving service after service
[52:27] and perhaps a hard shell over them that
[52:31] hasn't ever been softened by the Holy
[52:34] Spirit I pray oh god there com such a
[52:37] rain and such a saturation of your
[52:39] spirit that every hardened heart will
[52:43] not be able to resist the moving of your

[52:48] supernatural way today Lord that you
[52:51] would give us your anointing let the
[52:54] anointed of God come down upon us and

[53:03] oh God as a messenger stands in the
[53:05] Pulpit May the Holy Spirit anoint him to
[53:09] minister the word of life because how
[53:12] can we preach unless we be
[53:14] sent Lord how can we Minister unless we
[53:17] are anointed and then how can we hear
[53:20] without a preacher and how can we hear
[53:23] then unless the Holy Spirit anoints the
[53:25] ear to hear so I ask Lord that you'll do
[53:28] your work today among us there are needs

[54:03] you shed Lord that we would remember
[54:06] today oh God the the great price that
[54:09] you paid for us Lord when you declared
[54:13] in that our worth to you father I pray
[54:17] in the name of Jesus you'll take away
[54:20] from us all feelings of
[54:22] unworthiness all feelings of downcast
[54:26] and unbelief and cause us Lord today to
[54:30] come before your gates with praise and
[54:33] with a worship in our hearts and uh and
[54:36] thoughts that are acceptable unto you
[54:39] Lord oh God that that word would go
[54:42] forth and then we would receive it in
[54:44] our hearts and there would be the amen
[54:47] and when the amen comes forth from our
[54:49] life then it causes you to move on our
[54:53] behalf Lord ministering to that need oh
[54:56] God you are the discerner of the
[54:59] thoughts and intents of the heart and
[55:01] you still have your word today as it
[55:03] goes forth and you know Lord what is in
[55:07] every heart and what needs to be
[55:09] discerned and what needs to be addressed
[55:12] and what needs to be spoken to Lord
[55:16] we're asking you to speak oh God give us
[55:19] ears to hear and an appetite to receive
[55:22] but we ask it in the name of Jesus For
[55:25] Your Glory for for your honor amen and
[55:29] amen praise the
[55:31] Lord amen God bless you isin't it
[55:35] wonderful to be here today and be in the
[55:38] presence of the Lord and we're just
[55:41] we're just wanting to Worship the Lord
[55:43] together if you just um Worship the Lord
[55:46] together with me as we read the word and
[55:49] as we preach the word is God speaks I
[55:52] believe that he can speak today through
[55:55] the ministry of the word directly to
[55:58] your heart and I believe he has a
[56:00] message for you this morning that he
[56:03] wants you to hear and you not not just
[56:06] hear as far as listen but be a doer of
[56:09] the word and your lives to be changed in
[56:12] his presence amen may God grant it to
[56:15] you today let's turn to 1 Corinthians
[56:18] chapter 15 and verse 51 if you'll read
[56:21] this together with me while you're
[56:23] standing 1 Corinthians 15 and verse1 15
[56:26] 1 we're going to be speaking on adopted
[56:29] son's
[56:31] ascending and we remember in our theme
[56:34] as we're going along of who art thou oh
[56:36] great
[56:37] Mountain Thou shalt become a plain and
[56:41] The Headstone shall be brought forth
[56:42] with shoutings crying Grace Grace un it
[56:47] verse 51 says behold I show you a
[56:50] mystery we shall not all sleep but we
[56:53] shall all be changed how many plans to
[56:57] be a part of that Lord whatever oh God
[57:00] the change that has taking place in my
[57:02] heart is a reflection of the change that
[57:06] I will receive in my body Amen in a
[57:09] moment in the twinkling of an eye at the
[57:13] last Trump for the trumpet shall sound
[57:15] and the dead shall be raised and
[57:18] corruptible and we shall be changed for
[57:23] this corruptible must put on
[57:24] incorruption
[57:26] which is the reverse of what happened at
[57:29] the fall because there incorruption put
[57:33] on
[57:34] corruption but there you know there was
[57:38] immortality that took on mortality but
[57:41] here this Mortal must put on
[57:45] immortality so when this corruptible
[57:48] shall put on
[57:49] incorruption and this Mortal shall have
[57:52] put on
[57:53] immortality then shall be brought to
[57:55] pass the SA that is written death is
[57:58] swallowed up in
[58:01] Victory amen God bless you can be
[58:05] seated oh my I know with that saying
[58:08] brought to pass of death swallowed up in
[58:11] Victory there'll be great rejoicing in
[58:13] heaven
[58:15] amen now there cannot be a victory
[58:19] without a
[58:20] battle without war and before the bride
[58:24] can be raptured the war must be
[58:28] settled and it must be settled in heaven
[58:31] now two things must happen first Satan
[58:35] cast down and the battle won and when
[58:38] that happens the dead in Christ will
[58:40] resurrect and come here it will actually
[58:43] release them to come here and and of
[58:47] course their they will resurrect their
[58:49] bodies and glorify them and then we will
[58:52] be changed and then Jesus comes and we
[58:56] will meet him in the air 1 Thessalonians
[58:59] 4:16 says the Lord himself shall descend
[59:04] from heaven with a shout and with the
[59:07] voice of the Archangel and with the
[59:09] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[59:10] shall rise first and then we which are
[59:14] alive and remain shall be caught up
[59:17] together with them in the clouds to meet
[59:20] the Lord in the air and so shall we ever
[59:23] be with the Lord what promises that we
[59:27] have in the scripture you see there's an
[59:29] appointed place that we're going to meet
[59:32] him we will not meet him here on the
[59:35] earth as Earthbound creatures but we
[59:39] will meet him in the air as glorified
[59:42] Sons and Daughters of God Amen we will
[59:46] not meet him in bodies of Flesh and the
[59:48] sense of mortal flesh because flesh and
[59:52] blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God
[59:54] the Bible says but but we will meet him
[59:57] in changed
[59:58] bodies you see not only in the in the
[1:00:02] type of Sarah could she not receive the
[1:00:05] the promised son in the body that old
[1:00:08] decrepit form that she had but she had
[1:00:10] to be changed in order to receive that
[1:00:14] promised son even so we cannot meet the
[1:00:17] Lord in these bodies these bodies are
[1:00:20] Rags that we have sinned in and you know
[1:00:23] many things in our lives and in these
[1:00:26] bodies remind us of our sins you know
[1:00:29] where that we smoke we drank we lied we
[1:00:32] bore the marks of sin Upon Our flesh but
[1:00:36] there will be no signs of sin no
[1:00:40] remembrance of any kind of marks of
[1:00:43] unbelief that will be on our bodies we
[1:00:47] will be in total
[1:00:49] perfection without one blemish without a
[1:00:53] spot without even a wrinkle what a
[1:00:56] promise that is to us as mortal
[1:00:59] creatures today that we can look toward
[1:01:02] a promise of
[1:01:04] immortality that there we have an
[1:01:06] appointed place to meet him just like he
[1:01:10] spoke to um the disciples before he went
[1:01:13] away and he says now I'm um I I I want
[1:01:16] you to meet me in
[1:01:19] Jerusalem after my resurrection and and
[1:01:22] so we also have a designated place to
[1:01:26] meet him we are to meet him in the air
[1:01:30] and we have an Old Testament prophecy
[1:01:32] that is a type in the scripture where
[1:01:35] that Abraham sent his servant elaser to
[1:01:38] get a bride for Isaac it is a an
[1:01:42] allegory or a parable or more than just
[1:01:46] a story but a prophecy of what God would
[1:01:50] do about getting himself a bride for his
[1:01:54] own son and and of course Abraham had
[1:01:57] sent his servant to get a a bride and
[1:02:01] and um you know she had to be of his kin
[1:02:04] folk she couldn't be just of anyone she
[1:02:06] had to be related to him this is why
[1:02:10] that through our new birth we are
[1:02:12] related to him these old fleshly bodies
[1:02:15] are not related to him they are they are
[1:02:18] Redeemed by him but they're not related
[1:02:20] to him but he will change them and
[1:02:23] glorify them and our new bodies will be
[1:02:26] related to him but already in our soul
[1:02:30] we have a relationship with him because
[1:02:33] we are of the same genus the same seed
[1:02:36] the same likeness the same kind and so
[1:02:40] as as at as we think of this at the end
[1:02:44] of the long journey and I've reflected
[1:02:47] before and I think of it again as I I I
[1:02:52] I just something within me size you know
[1:02:55] what what a great day is going to be
[1:02:58] when we are finally
[1:03:00] home when the Troubles of Life are over
[1:03:03] when the Sorrows of this world is passed
[1:03:07] when the enmity of this flesh is over
[1:03:10] with and the wars that we have
[1:03:13] experienced in this body is all over
[1:03:16] with and we're finally
[1:03:18] home when we finally meet him this one
[1:03:23] that we have longed to see it's a
[1:03:26] it's it's going to be the most awesome
[1:03:28] wonderful moment and we know that and as
[1:03:32] elaser went to get a Rebecca and they
[1:03:36] were approaching the Homeland and the
[1:03:39] Bible says that Isaac came down to meet
[1:03:43] her you know he didn't meet her exactly
[1:03:46] there just like Jesus will not meet us
[1:03:49] in heaven but he will meet us in the air
[1:03:53] in Genesis 2462
[1:03:55] Isaac came from the well way of the of
[1:03:59] the well leyro which means the one who
[1:04:03] sees all things you may be wondering
[1:04:06] about your own life today but let me
[1:04:09] just tell you God sees it he sees your
[1:04:12] struggles he sees your situation if
[1:04:15] you're fatherless he understands he saw
[1:04:18] your fatherless condition if you're
[1:04:21] without a spouse he saw that situation
[1:04:24] he knows if your children are astray or
[1:04:27] you've been bered of children you know
[1:04:30] God knows he's the one who sees he is
[1:04:34] also known as the Living God so he comes
[1:04:37] to meet us at The Well of the living one
[1:04:41] the one who sees our afflictions that
[1:04:44] understands our problems that comes to
[1:04:46] meet us at a place where where God is is
[1:04:51] shows himself alive that he's real that
[1:04:55] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:04:58] forever The God Who changes not and so
[1:05:01] he he he says he came down by the way of
[1:05:04] The Well of lroy and where he dwelt in
[1:05:08] the South Country and Isaac went out to
[1:05:11] meditate in the field at the evening
[1:05:14] time and he lifted up his eyes and saw
[1:05:18] and behold the camels were coming and
[1:05:22] Isaac or Rebecca lifted up her eyes and
[1:05:25] when she saw Isaac she lighted off the
[1:05:27] camel for she said un to the servant
[1:05:31] what man is this that walketh in the
[1:05:33] field to meet us and the servant had
[1:05:36] said that it is my master therefore she
[1:05:40] took a veil and covered herself now I
[1:05:43] want you to get the picture here today
[1:05:45] in the very type that not only has the
[1:05:49] bride been
[1:05:51] anticipating no doubt around the
[1:05:54] campfires at night perhaps asking
[1:05:57] questions learning about Isaac wondering
[1:06:01] what Isaac was really like can you tell
[1:06:03] me something about him oh servant of
[1:06:07] Abraham you know you you know Isaac I've
[1:06:10] never met him I've only heard about him
[1:06:13] but I I want to know about him you know
[1:06:17] I I want to know his character and what
[1:06:21] I'm to expect and how he's going to
[1:06:24] receive me and what kind of home am I
[1:06:26] going to and you know what is my future
[1:06:29] home of this heavenly bridegroom and
[1:06:32] this Earthly bride and you know tell me
[1:06:35] what he's like you know what what what
[1:06:37] is his feature and I I can almost hear
[1:06:40] him say you know well I saw him one
[1:06:43] night in in a corn field and in a
[1:06:46] Sagebrush field and and there is the
[1:06:48] wind was blowing I saw him standing
[1:06:51] there in midair I saw his garments
[1:06:54] flowing his face was was there his eyes
[1:06:58] when when he looked at me I just passed
[1:07:01] out I couldn't take it when he looked he
[1:07:03] said he could look like he could speak
[1:07:06] the world into Oblivion but yet he had
[1:07:08] such compassion and such Mercy when he
[1:07:12] looked at me you know and and he would
[1:07:14] begin to describe you know I we've been
[1:07:17] making plans a long time you see God had
[1:07:21] a plan for you and it didn't just start
[1:07:24] here but it started started before the
[1:07:26] foundation of the world you see yes he
[1:07:30] knew that you would need Redemption so
[1:07:33] he planned it all out before the world
[1:07:35] began and and he became the lamb slain
[1:07:38] in his own thinking I'll give my life
[1:07:42] I'll give my life and I want you to know
[1:07:44] you know Isaac is is that kind of a man
[1:07:48] he he he would become the sacrifice and
[1:07:51] willingly would lay down upon the Altar
[1:07:55] and care um you know he he would become
[1:07:58] the the lamb but yet God would spare him
[1:08:01] Rebecca and not take his life but I want
[1:08:04] you to know about our Isaac God didn't
[1:08:07] spare him he poured all the Wrath all
[1:08:10] the enmity all of the hatred all of the
[1:08:14] things that that the the wrath of God
[1:08:17] that was upon sin and we were The Sinner
[1:08:21] and he poured it out upon
[1:08:23] him and he became the sacrifice for our
[1:08:28] Redemption I'm talking about our Isaac
[1:08:30] now I'm talking about our Isaac who
[1:08:33] became the lamb that would take that
[1:08:36] would be the W the the wounded lamb as
[1:08:39] it had been slain and this lamb who had
[1:08:42] paid the price would come and claim the
[1:08:45] inheritance for every one of you that
[1:08:48] you could be married and United you
[1:08:52] unworthy lost creatures could be saved
[1:08:57] delivered and know God in
[1:09:00] power and be a child of God be in his
[1:09:09] family he came all the way from Glory
[1:09:12] Rebecca he willingly gave his
[1:09:15] life we have journeyed for seven Church
[1:09:18] chases we've made Seven camps along the
[1:09:22] way and you know we're getting close to
[1:09:24] home now this next one from this Camp is
[1:09:31] home from this
[1:09:35] age is the
[1:09:37] meeting there are no more camps to go to
[1:09:41] no more no more lonely nights no more
[1:09:44] times without him trouble's gone the
[1:09:48] threats of of being harmed of of Raiders
[1:09:51] coming in and destroying us taking our
[1:09:54] life all of that's over
[1:09:56] the devil will be bound for a thousand
[1:09:59] years amen oh what is he going to be
[1:10:02] when we get
[1:10:04] [Music]
[1:10:05] home the burden's passed the trouble's
[1:10:09] over and to think he's going to prepare
[1:10:13] a place for
[1:10:15] you he's anticipating your arrival there
[1:10:20] he's been meditating in the
[1:10:22] field amen he's been thinking
[1:10:26] yeah this moment I've been waiting on
[1:10:30] you think you waited a long time your
[1:10:33] time on Earth is just not even a blip in
[1:10:38] eternity but in the Eternal ages Beyond
[1:10:41] he was thinking of you everything he
[1:10:44] ever did has been revolved around you
[1:10:49] your plan his plan for your life
[1:10:52] bringing you into Perfection bringing in
[1:10:54] you into to Glory everything he's ever
[1:10:57] done every plan he's ever did the very
[1:11:01] reason Jesus came the very reason that
[1:11:04] he sent Messengers to the ages the very
[1:11:06] reason he sent the last Angel messenger
[1:11:09] amen was on all account of
[1:11:15] you you see he was the only one
[1:11:19] worthy to take the book and loose the
[1:11:22] seals and doing so he revealed his work
[1:11:25] to the ages and he also has exposed the
[1:11:29] Antichrist and he's going to prepare a
[1:11:32] place for you anticipating your arrival
[1:11:36] oh I hear Brother Bram talk about this
[1:11:39] in the leoan age he says this is the
[1:11:43] last warning there will not be another
[1:11:46] the throne room has been set up the 12
[1:11:49] foundations have been laid the streets
[1:11:52] of gold have been paved the gates of
[1:11:55] gigantic pearls are raised and hinged
[1:11:59] like a pyramid she stands so fair and
[1:12:02] glorious the Heavenly beings who have
[1:12:06] prepared her watch breathlessly for she
[1:12:09] glistens and shines with the glory that
[1:12:12] is unearthly every facet of her beauty
[1:12:15] tells the story of Amazing Grace and of
[1:12:18] Jesus love and she's a city prepared for
[1:12:21] prepared people she awaits only for her
[1:12:26] inhabitants and soon they will strong
[1:12:29] they will throng her streets with joy
[1:12:31] yes it's the last call the spirit will
[1:12:34] not speak in another age the ages are
[1:12:42] over but he's
[1:12:45] meditating think of Isaac having left
[1:12:48] the tent standing out in the
[1:12:52] field meditating in the late
[1:12:55] afternoon when he sees Rebecca
[1:12:59] coming she had never seen him he of
[1:13:03] course Isaac had never seen her but when
[1:13:06] they met it was love at first
[1:13:08] sight she fell in love with him and he
[1:13:12] with her and and and she veiled herself
[1:13:16] oh I want you to understand friends you
[1:13:18] see the Bible said to buy me rment white
[1:13:22] rment that you might be clothed
[1:13:25] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[1:13:28] appear amen the bride will not be in the
[1:13:32] drags of her
[1:13:33] Humanity because that would be nakedness
[1:13:37] you would feel so exposed wearing the
[1:13:40] dirty rags of this journey but in this
[1:13:44] moment that you before you meet him you
[1:13:47] get veiled you get a garment placed over
[1:13:51] you you get a fresh Ren of you of a
[1:13:54] Fresh B baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:13:58] shrouded with deity himself so that you
[1:14:01] can go and meet him not as a mortal but
[1:14:05] as an
[1:14:09] immortal what a day that will
[1:14:13] be Jesus will lead the kingdom and
[1:14:17] brother
[1:14:17] Brandon says it this way we'll not meet
[1:14:21] him in glory we are to meet him in the
[1:14:24] air
[1:14:25] between heavens and earth where it's
[1:14:29] expanded to redeem
[1:14:33] us in that great Rapture hour Heaven is
[1:14:37] expanded which means
[1:14:40] enlarged the mighty Angel descends his
[1:14:44] anointing strikes the Earth as he as he
[1:14:47] moves in his bride in the final cresendo
[1:14:50] and she does the works of God and as
[1:14:53] seven Thunders the very voice of God
[1:14:56] others their voices and mysterious
[1:14:59] things that have been to others now come
[1:15:03] known as as God becomes unveiled or or
[1:15:07] or made clear before our
[1:15:10] eyes and and the book is handed back to
[1:15:13] man as as they enter into full life
[1:15:17] complete and full Redemption comes as
[1:15:21] the Saints oh yeah even the dead in
[1:15:23] Christ come here and pick up their
[1:15:26] redeemed bodies and and are glorified
[1:15:29] and then we when we see them we too are
[1:15:33] changed and together we go to meet the
[1:15:36] Lord in the
[1:15:41] air this will all be the result of the
[1:15:45] greatest Cosmic battle
[1:15:48] ever and Heavens will be cleansed of
[1:15:51] Satan as the accuser of the Brethren is
[1:15:54] cast down
[1:15:56] I think a scripture that is so pertinent
[1:15:58] in our hour and gives me much excitement
[1:16:02] to preach
[1:16:04] about when I when I think about the
[1:16:06] subject at hand this morning I I can't
[1:16:09] hardly I can't hardly wait just to talk
[1:16:13] about it to speak about it and let the
[1:16:15] anointing of God flow through the word
[1:16:17] to you on it but as we read and you can
[1:16:21] turn to Revelation 12 and 7 and you go
[1:16:24] ahead and put that up
[1:16:25] that that that Revelation that we are
[1:16:29] going to read describes the last
[1:16:32] Angelic battle and Satan's ultimate
[1:16:36] expulsion from heaven from this point he
[1:16:39] will never enter into Heaven
[1:16:43] Again from this point on after this he
[1:16:46] gets Bound for a thousand years you know
[1:16:49] on the other side of when he's loose for
[1:16:52] a short season and the final Rebellion
[1:16:55] don't get back into
[1:16:56] heaven but he's cast into the Lake of
[1:17:02] Fire so this is his this right here is
[1:17:06] his last who raw in heaven and it ends
[1:17:11] in
[1:17:15] defeat it ends with him being
[1:17:19] expelled from
[1:17:22] Heaven forever
[1:17:30] forever John sees a great war between
[1:17:33] Michael and the angels of God and the
[1:17:36] dragon Satan and his Fallen Angels or
[1:17:38] his
[1:17:39] demons that takes place here in the end
[1:17:42] time Satan in his great pride and
[1:17:45] delusion that he can be like God he will
[1:17:48] lead his final rebellion in the heavens
[1:17:51] against God but it'll be a cosmic
[1:17:55] mismatch thus the dragon and his demons
[1:17:59] will lose the battle and be thrown out
[1:18:01] of Heaven
[1:18:03] forever we are looking this morning
[1:18:06] ahead not only do we see Jesus but we
[1:18:10] also see Satan cast
[1:18:12] down amen and for him to be cast down
[1:18:15] that means there's got to be a people of
[1:18:18] sin that's why I'm preaching about
[1:18:20] adopted Sons
[1:18:22] ascending not falling but
[1:18:27] ascending Revelation 12:7 says and there
[1:18:30] was war in heaven and Michael and his
[1:18:31] angels fought against the dragon and the
[1:18:34] dragon fought and his angels and
[1:18:36] prevailed
[1:18:39] not oh if we could just get down out
[1:18:41] under our fifth rib this morning and
[1:18:44] just weigh down in a heart just a moment
[1:18:46] and look down on the let it sink down on
[1:18:49] the inside right here into the heart and
[1:18:52] realize your enemy is not going to win
[1:18:57] you may be battling with sickness and
[1:18:59] that sickness may take you down to death
[1:19:01] but even death cannot defeat
[1:19:04] you amen death will only birth you into
[1:19:07] a new
[1:19:08] land amen into a theophonic form where
[1:19:12] there's no sorrow or no
[1:19:14] sickness and there and so he prevailed
[1:19:17] not and neither was there any place
[1:19:20] found their place notice their place
[1:19:23] found anymore in heaven now we could
[1:19:26] take these places and we could show you
[1:19:28] that you know of Judas you know he
[1:19:30] assert Authority that didn't belong to
[1:19:33] him and he was one of the 12 but he
[1:19:37] never he never belonged
[1:19:40] there are you are you with me he was
[1:19:42] only occupying the place of another man
[1:19:46] who wasn't ready to come there his name
[1:19:49] was the Apostle Paul and he had a work
[1:19:52] to do I'm talking about Judas he had to
[1:19:55] betray the Lord there had to be a
[1:19:58] crucifixion there had to be the slaying
[1:20:01] of the lamb and somebody had to do
[1:20:04] it so one was chosen even though he was
[1:20:07] a devil and he occupied the place of an
[1:20:12] apostle but the Bible said that he fell
[1:20:15] and went to his own
[1:20:18] place amen you find that in Acts chapter
[1:20:21] one and this is exactly the whole
[1:20:23] picture of the ex of Satan he is
[1:20:26] occupying a place that is not
[1:20:30] his because somebody hasn't been ready
[1:20:34] to take it
[1:20:38] yet now let's look into these great
[1:20:42] truths and the Great Dragon was cast
[1:20:46] out the old serpent called the devil now
[1:20:49] we find out who he was this is the one
[1:20:51] who deceived Eve which deceiveth the
[1:20:53] whole world
[1:20:56] caus the whole world to fall into sin
[1:20:59] and he was cast out in the earth and his
[1:21:02] angels were cast out with him and I
[1:21:04] heard a loud voice saying in heaven now
[1:21:08] is come salvation and strength and the
[1:21:11] kingdom of our God and the power of His
[1:21:14] Christ for the accuser of our Brethren
[1:21:17] is cast down which accused them before
[1:21:20] our God day and night now this is
[1:21:22] exactly the same as is what we read this
[1:21:25] great Victory where death is swallowed
[1:21:29] up in
[1:21:30] Victory now so he say here is come that
[1:21:34] Victory here is come salvation strength
[1:21:38] and the kingdom of God here is the
[1:21:40] fullness of the Holy
[1:21:43] Ghost and the power of His Christ full
[1:21:47] Redemption for the accuser of our
[1:21:49] Brethren is cast down which accuse them
[1:21:52] before our God day and night and they
[1:21:54] over overcame them by the blood of the
[1:21:55] lamb and by the word of their testimony
[1:21:58] and they love not their lives un the
[1:22:00] death and there in the next verse shows
[1:22:04] these raptured Overcomers rejoicing in
[1:22:06] heaven therefore Rejoice you heavens and
[1:22:09] you that dwell in them and then there is
[1:22:12] a woe pronounced to those Left Behind oh
[1:22:15] Church you don't want to be left
[1:22:20] behind whatever it
[1:22:22] takes whatever you have to
[1:22:25] do there is nothing in this world worth
[1:22:29] being left behind
[1:22:31] for you may look and maybe your pride
[1:22:35] exalts this or exalts that and and you
[1:22:38] know judah's got 30 pieces of silver you
[1:22:42] know some people will sell him out for a
[1:22:44] little bit of whirlin a little bit of
[1:22:47] sin a little bit of something that they
[1:22:50] think is so valuable that is so
[1:22:53] important that they will put that ahead
[1:22:56] of Jesus I'll tell you what there ain't
[1:22:57] nothing
[1:22:59] worth that that can even compare to
[1:23:02] Jesus to eternal life and the glory that
[1:23:05] shall be revealed in us but they mock us
[1:23:08] and they make fun of us and and we
[1:23:10] suffer brother Tim and the sufferings of
[1:23:13] this life is nothing to be compared with
[1:23:16] the glory that shall be revealed in
[1:23:22] US therefore Rejoice you Heavens you
[1:23:25] that dwell in them but woe to the
[1:23:28] inhabiters of the earth and the Sea for
[1:23:30] the devil has come down to to you have a
[1:23:32] great wrath because he knoweth he hath
[1:23:35] but a short
[1:23:39] time we're currently in the last
[1:23:46] battle I'm talking about before we get
[1:23:50] home sure there'll be Army again sure on
[1:23:54] the other side of the tribulation and on
[1:23:57] the other side of of of the Millennium
[1:23:59] even there's another great battle often
[1:24:02] called Gog and
[1:24:03] Magog but whatever we are currently in
[1:24:07] the last
[1:24:08] battle before the
[1:24:11] Rapture and it is the battle for the
[1:24:14] position of
[1:24:17] sons now that's what we're talking about
[1:24:19] adopted Sons we're not talking about
[1:24:21] adopting the devil's children and make
[1:24:22] them God's children but we're talking
[1:24:25] about a Roman would for example it was a
[1:24:29] custom in that day to take his own son
[1:24:32] when he came of age when he was mature
[1:24:35] and give make a celebration it would
[1:24:38] happen well about the age of 30 where he
[1:24:42] had been trained and tutored and learned
[1:24:44] the business and whatever and now the
[1:24:47] father was going to put it all in his
[1:24:51] hands friends it's about to be all put
[1:24:54] put back in our hands again in the
[1:24:56] millennial Reign we we will not take a
[1:25:00] an Axe and cut down a tree we will speak
[1:25:03] and it will
[1:25:05] happen why why isn't that given now
[1:25:08] because you got too much
[1:25:11] flesh amen how how many cars would you
[1:25:14] have spoken to Oblivion that that got in
[1:25:17] your way this
[1:25:20] morning that you in in your in your
[1:25:23] frustration and your anger that you know
[1:25:26] in your
[1:25:28] flesh you didn't spoke them out of your
[1:25:30] way spoke it into
[1:25:33] Oblivion but I tell you in that day our
[1:25:36] Natures will be totally changed it'll be
[1:25:39] a round of perfect love it'll be full of
[1:25:43] the Holy Ghost it will it will be
[1:25:46] something where where compassion and
[1:25:49] care and love permeates from God's
[1:25:53] people we currently in the last battle
[1:25:56] and it's a battle for
[1:25:57] positions you may not realize it this
[1:26:00] morning but you are in that
[1:26:02] battle and you are in that battle for
[1:26:05] your
[1:26:06] position to position yourself as a son
[1:26:09] or daughter of God it's it's easy to
[1:26:12] fall into the Trap of positioning
[1:26:14] yourself as a poor decrepit
[1:26:19] humanity and you see the troubles and
[1:26:21] the sorrows and sometimes you get over
[1:26:24] whelmed with the grief and the troubles
[1:26:26] that are around you and it's easy to
[1:26:29] position yourself there but what what
[1:26:31] the battle is is over your position of a
[1:26:35] son or a daughter of
[1:26:37] God to take your authority over the
[1:26:40] kingdom over the realm that God has
[1:26:43] given
[1:26:44] you we could talk about that for a
[1:26:47] moment but everybody doesn't have the
[1:26:49] same
[1:26:49] realm I have a realm as a pastor over at
[1:26:53] church but but my realm don't include
[1:26:55] every other church around the country a
[1:26:58] messenger to an age would have a realm
[1:27:00] that would expand around the world
[1:27:04] because he's got a he got a Ministry and
[1:27:06] a message to all
[1:27:07] people of the bride of Christ that's his
[1:27:10] realm that's what he's given that's why
[1:27:14] you know he had to walk the narrow way
[1:27:16] and choose a narrow path and and and
[1:27:19] where where God would come along and say
[1:27:21] it's my way because it's real a mother
[1:27:25] has a realm and that realm of her
[1:27:27] kingdom would be her children a wife
[1:27:30] would have a realm and that would be
[1:27:31] that of a husband and a
[1:27:33] family a husband would have a realm of a
[1:27:37] family where he's in there you may be a
[1:27:40] single person but you have a realm and a
[1:27:43] realm of influence a young person and
[1:27:46] you must be responsible in wherever God
[1:27:48] has called you and placed you because
[1:27:50] you see you have to show yourself
[1:27:52] faithful and true in that position
[1:27:55] before he trust you with
[1:27:58] another so you see our realm must be
[1:28:01] from the Heavenly realm where we control
[1:28:05] the atmospheres of our
[1:28:08] lives and and and our place and position
[1:28:11] in Heaven Must Be one before we can go
[1:28:17] there now and and before we can go there
[1:28:22] Satan must be cast out
[1:28:26] first and there will be a people that
[1:28:29] will overcome Satan first and foremost
[1:28:32] by the blood of the lamb and then by
[1:28:35] agreeing with the word by saying Amen to
[1:28:39] the word by rejoicing in
[1:28:42] tribulations by being thankful in
[1:28:45] wherever God has placed you at this
[1:28:47] moment being happy and content and
[1:28:51] whatever state you find yourself in
[1:28:54] bringing the atmosphere of Heaven rather
[1:28:56] than atmospheres of doubt and fear and
[1:28:59] sorrow and tears of
[1:29:04] unbelief it's very very important
[1:29:07] because the only way you'll ever meet
[1:29:10] Jesus is in the right air the right
[1:29:17] atmosphere if your atmosphere is full of
[1:29:20] of of frustration and doubting and
[1:29:23] confusion I usion and anger and and
[1:29:27] expressions you can never meet Jesus
[1:29:29] there he only is met in a place where
[1:29:34] that that you're appreciative of the
[1:29:36] blood of the
[1:29:37] Lamb amen and then you agree with the
[1:29:41] what the word says and where the word
[1:29:44] has placed you even if it's for a
[1:29:49] moment because the trials that you go
[1:29:52] through are for just a
[1:29:54] moment but to have an eternal weight of
[1:30:00] Glory so you see Satan must be cast out
[1:30:03] first there will be un people overcome
[1:30:07] Satan first and foremost as I said by
[1:30:09] the blood of the Lamb by agreeing with
[1:30:12] the word by testifying of what the word
[1:30:16] says and then loving the truth more than
[1:30:20] their own
[1:30:21] life for some the Bible tells tell you
[1:30:24] in the last days their lack of love for
[1:30:27] truth will cause their
[1:30:29] fall for they will be damn because they
[1:30:33] don't just love
[1:30:37] truth and for the
[1:30:39] bride she will
[1:30:42] overcome because she loves the word over
[1:30:46] her own
[1:30:48] life but the world says this but I think
[1:30:52] that
[1:30:54] but I I don't think this is wrong and I
[1:30:57] think you know listen forget your
[1:31:01] thoughts amen you know Rebecca may have
[1:31:04] had her own thoughts of of way you know
[1:31:07] maybe the culture she came from the way
[1:31:10] that she was but whatever she was
[1:31:12] willing to blend with
[1:31:16] Isaac she could say take this whole
[1:31:19] world let leave everything of my
[1:31:22] homeland behind of what I've known and
[1:31:25] the Norms that I've known and the the
[1:31:27] lifestyles that I'm leave it all behind
[1:31:30] but just let me have
[1:31:32] Isaac I'll take
[1:31:34] him that's the bride she's going to
[1:31:37] trade everything for
[1:31:40] Christ it's never questioning why how
[1:31:44] come why must I why did this why this
[1:31:47] restriction why that Lord I just want to
[1:31:50] please
[1:31:52] you I just want to be acceptable in your
[1:31:55] sight I just want when I meet you
[1:31:57] there's love at first
[1:31:59] sight amen you see and for the bride
[1:32:03] she's going to love the word over her
[1:32:06] own
[1:32:08] life and as they
[1:32:11] rise as they ascend Satan is cast
[1:32:16] down now as of right now Satan is the
[1:32:20] God of this evil age he is worship today
[1:32:24] by
[1:32:27] billions amen well you say brother jtim
[1:32:30] I've got a different opinion from this
[1:32:32] message and I have a different opinion
[1:32:34] about things and what brother Bram had
[1:32:36] well you're just one of the
[1:32:41] billions one of the
[1:32:47] billions
[1:32:50] well but for the bride she's going to
[1:32:53] love the word
[1:32:55] she going to love
[1:32:58] truth somebody with me amen she going to
[1:33:02] love truth she's going to love the word
[1:33:05] well it doesn't specifically say we
[1:33:07] can't smoke listen she's going to love
[1:33:09] the
[1:33:10] word she's not going to defile her
[1:33:13] Temple she's not going to look like the
[1:33:17] world it doesn't specifically say we
[1:33:20] can't enjoy marijuana she's not going to
[1:33:22] question it
[1:33:25] she's not going to ponder it she going
[1:33:27] to lay aside what she thinks about it
[1:33:30] and the Norms of the world and and the
[1:33:33] world's opinion and the scientific views
[1:33:35] and and the ideas of the world and she's
[1:33:37] going to take what he says because he's
[1:33:41] her
[1:33:46] head and as they
[1:33:49] arise they ascend and as they ascend
[1:33:54] Satan is cast
[1:33:56] down the question
[1:33:58] arises if Satan had already
[1:34:02] rebelled
[1:34:04] and was cast down from heaven perhaps
[1:34:08] even before the world was
[1:34:10] created or maybe maybe before man you
[1:34:15] know was yet upon the Earth why is he
[1:34:18] free to be both now in heaven and on
[1:34:21] Earth how how come how come he can come
[1:34:24] to Earth how come he he can he has free
[1:34:26] Reign Over the Earth how come he can
[1:34:30] he's even in heaven to be cast
[1:34:32] down why is he even there how did he
[1:34:36] even get
[1:34:37] there we know he rebelled in the
[1:34:39] beginning and was cast out so how did he
[1:34:43] come back how did he somehow get back in
[1:34:46] the heavens where he's got to be cast
[1:34:48] out the second time and what position is
[1:34:52] he in and you know he can't be anymore
[1:34:56] the covering Angel of the hovering
[1:34:58] cherub that cover and the protector of
[1:35:02] the word he he never could be a
[1:35:04] protector of the throne anymore he's
[1:35:07] been cast out from there but where is he
[1:35:10] what is he doing how come he's there who
[1:35:13] let him back
[1:35:17] in as right now let me tell you
[1:35:21] definitively Satan is the god of this
[1:35:24] evil
[1:35:25] age he is worshiped by billions he's
[1:35:28] called The Prince of Darkness he's
[1:35:30] called The Prince of this world he is
[1:35:33] even said that he he has that Darkness
[1:35:37] has a time remember is not
[1:35:41] Eternal it won't be
[1:35:44] forever for an eternity it's only for a
[1:35:48] season for a
[1:35:50] Time Satan has a limit on him
[1:35:54] he has an expiration
[1:35:57] date amen that's one thing about you you
[1:35:59] don't have an expiration
[1:36:02] date your body may have but even then
[1:36:06] it'll be picked up resurrected and
[1:36:09] glorified so you see here here we are
[1:36:12] you know in an end time battle and it's
[1:36:15] a battle between the sons of Light and
[1:36:17] the powers of
[1:36:20] darkness and as the sons of Light we
[1:36:23] have been made to have a
[1:36:27] Dominion but we lost our sunship and the
[1:36:30] Dominion that comes with it because of
[1:36:32] the
[1:36:32] fall but I think about this when brother
[1:36:35] bradam tells about how that we were made
[1:36:39] to be Gods sons of God offsprings of God
[1:36:44] with dominion over the world and and and
[1:36:48] then the longing that Romans 8 shows
[1:36:51] that we spoke on last Sunday of
[1:36:54] or all creation granth and travaileth
[1:36:57] together even
[1:36:58] now waiting for the adoption the placing
[1:37:02] of sons in their full Authority and
[1:37:05] position when the world will cease to
[1:37:08] Gran When sin will be totally done away
[1:37:12] with when evil will no longer be
[1:37:16] prevalent on the
[1:37:18] earth and there'll be no more Wars and
[1:37:20] killing upon the Earth and a great
[1:37:23] Millen Millennial rain will
[1:37:25] Dawn see he says we're waiting for the
[1:37:28] manifestations that's the
[1:37:30] revealing of the sons of God who will
[1:37:34] come back and take it over again waiting
[1:37:35] for the fullness of time when the
[1:37:38] pyramid gets up to the top when full
[1:37:40] sons of God will be manifested when the
[1:37:42] power of God will walk out Hallelujah
[1:37:46] and will take every Power that Satan has
[1:37:49] away from him let me just talk about
[1:37:52] these expectations
[1:37:54] in this end Time battle we're not
[1:37:56] talking about a weak and a powerless
[1:37:59] generation we're not talking about a
[1:38:01] people whose only weapon is argument but
[1:38:05] a people who has power over the darkness
[1:38:08] of
[1:38:09] Hell amen the power to cast Satan out
[1:38:13] the power to remit sins and they be
[1:38:16] remitted by the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:38:19] by the baptism of the spirit amen so you
[1:38:23] see he was the logos that went out of
[1:38:27] God that's true he's the word of God and
[1:38:30] then he made man a little
[1:38:33] God he made him from the
[1:38:37] word he was a product of God's Own
[1:38:41] spoken word where God created Man In His
[1:38:44] Image later he would form him out the
[1:38:47] dust of the Earth but first he's a
[1:38:50] creation in God's image and he's made an
[1:38:53] immortal
[1:38:56] spirit and so here in this form we we
[1:39:00] find he made man a God in his domain and
[1:39:05] that domain was to go from sea to Sea
[1:39:07] from Shore to
[1:39:09] Shore he was to have control over it he
[1:39:12] was to expand heaven on Earth until Eden
[1:39:17] would go from sea to Sea where the glory
[1:39:19] of God would cover the
[1:39:21] Earth and God gave him Dominion in a
[1:39:24] little spot on the earth and he says
[1:39:27] okay take dominion over this and as you
[1:39:30] take Dominion expand that
[1:39:33] Dominion until the glory of God will
[1:39:36] fill the Earth and I'll come dwell with
[1:39:39] my people on this
[1:39:40] Earth that's been God's plan for the
[1:39:43] Earth all along it's not the devil's
[1:39:47] Earth neither is this Earth of your body
[1:39:50] the
[1:39:51] devil's it was God's first
[1:39:54] he laid out the Timbers for them when he
[1:39:57] created the world and he put the very
[1:39:59] poish out the calcium all the elements
[1:40:02] that would be needed to made your body
[1:40:04] he laid it on the earth the Timbers to
[1:40:06] make your
[1:40:10] body but because of sin we come a
[1:40:13] different way we come formed in a
[1:40:15] woman's womb we came through the Pains
[1:40:17] of child birth and we come under the
[1:40:20] curse we were born in sin
[1:40:23] shaped in iniquity brought this world
[1:40:27] under the Prince of Darkness speaking
[1:40:29] his
[1:40:33] lies and then Jesus
[1:40:36] came and he proved that what a Son of
[1:40:40] God was to be
[1:40:42] like what God was to be like in the
[1:40:44] flesh what a born again man of woman a
[1:40:47] daughter of God son or daughter of God
[1:40:50] was to
[1:40:51] be he was the very first of the god race
[1:40:56] all the other in the god race would be
[1:40:58] just like
[1:41:00] him somebody with me
[1:41:03] now now as he did he was without sin and
[1:41:08] he proved it and he stood there when the
[1:41:10] winds blowed he said peace be
[1:41:13] still when the when the
[1:41:16] tree did not bear he said no man eat
[1:41:18] from you from here
[1:41:20] on and then he said barely barely I
[1:41:23] saying to you you little
[1:41:26] Gods you who believe can believe have
[1:41:29] the capacity of Faith like I do if you
[1:41:34] say to this mountain be moved and don't
[1:41:37] doubt in your heart but you believe what
[1:41:39] you said will come to pass you too can
[1:41:42] have what you
[1:41:45] say you look back in Genesis back to the
[1:41:49] original and we see the world is
[1:41:51] groaning and crying and and
[1:41:55] everything's Desiring the the
[1:41:57] manifestations of the sons of God so not
[1:42:00] only are we anticipating but the whole
[1:42:02] world
[1:42:03] GRS brother Bram would he he would he
[1:42:07] would see in his uncanny vision and
[1:42:12] understanding he' he'd look at a tree
[1:42:13] that was dying and he would see it
[1:42:17] groaning for
[1:42:19] life and he say look everything of
[1:42:22] nature is
[1:42:24] groaning waiting for the day when a tree
[1:42:27] won't
[1:42:29] die when there W be sorrow on the Earth
[1:42:32] where there'll never be
[1:42:35] another grave turned and with a yellow
[1:42:37] sod and a loved one put there and you
[1:42:40] bury your heart
[1:42:43] never waiting for the manifestations of
[1:42:46] the sons of God when true Sons born Sons
[1:42:49] field Sons speak and the word is back to
[1:42:53] and he said I believe we're on the
[1:42:55] border of it right
[1:42:57] now and I I want you to understand we're
[1:43:00] here in the blending of the two where
[1:43:02] where Heaven is actually expanded for
[1:43:06] the sake of
[1:43:07] redemption and here Out of Heaven Come
[1:43:10] seven Mighty
[1:43:12] Angels amen and and and Seven Seals are
[1:43:16] revealed because there seven
[1:43:18] manifestations of one Mighty Spirit of
[1:43:21] almighty God amen and here that in the
[1:43:25] presence of that Pillar of Fire that
[1:43:27] ball of fire here Revelations would come
[1:43:31] from God that could not come from
[1:43:33] schools of theology that could only come
[1:43:37] through a prophetic vision and a
[1:43:39] prophetic voice which is why we needed a
[1:43:45] prophet and he
[1:43:46] says so we're right here now on the
[1:43:50] border right on the border he
[1:43:54] says right where we say to this mountain
[1:43:57] let it be so brother I desire so and so
[1:44:01] certain thing done I'm a Believer in
[1:44:03] Jesus Christ I give it to you in the
[1:44:05] name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen

[1:44:15] name of the Lord God bless your crops oh
[1:44:19] waiting groaning all nature waiting for
[1:44:22] the Manifest St ations of the sons of
[1:44:24] God he ordained it at the beginning he
[1:44:27] gave man the domain listen Church you
[1:44:30] know I'm trying to give you a picture
[1:44:32] here uh the prophet wasn't just
[1:44:35] expecting it all in the
[1:44:36] [Music]
[1:44:38] Millennium but for manifestations of
[1:44:41] sons of
[1:44:43] God where he would reveal himself in his
[1:44:46] people in this last day he gave Jesus
[1:44:49] Christ and Jesus gave it in his name
[1:44:52] with this assurance ask the father
[1:44:53] anything in my name and I'll do it oh
[1:44:56] brother waiting for the manifestations
[1:44:58] of the sons of God to position the
[1:45:00] church as I said the book of Ephesians
[1:45:03] the Book of Joshua Joshua placing the
[1:45:05] people where they belong and if they
[1:45:07] wouldn't stand still he put eph from
[1:45:09] here and and said he run over to
[1:45:12] Manasses land and this come back of
[1:45:14] fussing and stewing how are they ever
[1:45:15] going to get along we once said I'm
[1:45:17] Baptist I'm Methodist I'm Pentecostal
[1:45:19] I'm oness I'm tness I'm so and so how
[1:45:21] how you going to do it stand still God's
[1:45:24] wanting to place his church Sons and
[1:45:27] Daughters of God he said God let me live
[1:45:29] to see it is my prayer so close I can
[1:45:33] just feel it with my hands almost looks
[1:45:35] like it's right there it's what I long
[1:45:37] to see waiting for the time when walk
[1:45:40] down the street there lays a
[1:45:42] laying there from his mother's womb
[1:45:44] Silver and Gold Have I None oh waiting
[1:45:47] for the manifestations of the sons of
[1:45:49] God hallelujah when they'll when God
[1:45:52] will make him s known when they'll stop
[1:45:54] sickness they'll stop cancer they'll
[1:45:57] stop
[1:46:02] diseases Hallelujah man if you can't
[1:46:04] believe that now how are you going to
[1:46:05] believe it for the body
[1:46:07] change because I guarantee you it's
[1:46:09] going to stop
[1:46:11] them amen he said you think Cancer's
[1:46:14] something the Bible said there's coming
[1:46:16] a Time men were rot in there right in
[1:46:18] their flesh and the buzzer to eat off
[1:46:19] the carcasses before they even die
[1:46:21] cancer is a toothache to what's coming
[1:46:23] remember the Hot horrible thing was
[1:46:25] forbidden in that day to touch those who
[1:46:27] had the Seal of God and that's what
[1:46:30] we're striving for now to get and be
[1:46:33] positionally placed into the kingdom of
[1:46:36] God before these horrible plagues
[1:46:40] strike placed sons of people who knows
[1:46:45] their
[1:46:47] position they know how to write their
[1:46:50] check and they know what's in the bank
[1:46:54] you see this is not a picture of a weak
[1:46:56] and defeated and faithless bride but a
[1:46:59] people who war against Satan and
[1:47:01] unbelief I'm just trying to get you a
[1:47:03] little window into the prophet's
[1:47:07] expectations you know now let's turn our
[1:47:10] thoughts to the heavens for a
[1:47:12] moment to
[1:47:14] Creation to the Earth where there was no
[1:47:17] conflict no war where all was at
[1:47:20] peace and let's see
[1:47:24] where War
[1:47:26] Began because sin didn't begin on Earth
[1:47:28] it began in heaven and the war started
[1:47:32] When sin
[1:47:34] came so War began in
[1:47:37] heaven so let's turn to Ezekiel chapter
[1:47:41] 28 and verse 12 and we have we've all
[1:47:44] read this allegory of Satan it's spoken
[1:47:47] to the king of Tyrus but it's only
[1:47:50] addressing the spirit that's in the man
[1:47:54] and it's looking Way Beyond him and
[1:47:56] seeing what's anointing him and he says
[1:47:58] son of man take a lamentation upon the
[1:48:00] king of
[1:48:01] Tyrus Ezekiel
[1:48:04] 28:12 and say unto him thus sayith the
[1:48:07] Lord God thou seal us up the sum Thou
[1:48:11] Art the Seal of perfection full of
[1:48:14] wisdom and perfect in Beauty thou has
[1:48:18] been in Eden the Garden of God every
[1:48:21] precious stone was covern the Sardis
[1:48:25] topaz the diamond the Burl the onx The
[1:48:28] Jasper the sapphire the emerald and all
[1:48:31] the and the carbuncle and the gold and
[1:48:34] the workmanship of thy tabrets and of
[1:48:37] thy pipes was prepared in thee in the
[1:48:39] day that thou was
[1:48:43] created Thou Art the anointed chab that
[1:48:49] coverthe thee so thou was in the Holy
[1:48:53] Mountain of God thou has walked up and
[1:48:55] down in the midst of the stones of fire
[1:48:58] in other words you had access to the
[1:49:01] Holy Mountain of God and walked among
[1:49:04] the stones of
[1:49:06] fire brother Bram says it this and
[1:49:09] marriage and divorce he said did you
[1:49:11] know Satan was co-equal with God one day
[1:49:15] sure was all but a
[1:49:19] Creator he was everything he stood right
[1:49:22] at the the right hand of God stood at
[1:49:24] the right hand of God in the heavens the
[1:49:26] great leading
[1:49:28] cheram think of this as he would say
[1:49:32] again the right hand of almighty God was
[1:49:36] Lucifer the son of the
[1:49:38] morning the first God created him almost
[1:49:41] co-workers with him he was a coworker
[1:49:44] partly equal with him only Satan could
[1:49:47] not create God's the only Creator but
[1:49:49] Satan took something God created and
[1:49:52] perverted did it back into something
[1:49:54] else
[1:49:56] evil so here he was a covering cherub
[1:50:00] supposedly a protector of the of the
[1:50:04] Ark a covering chair of a a a protector
[1:50:08] of the
[1:50:09] throne no one could come into the
[1:50:11] presence of
[1:50:13] God
[1:50:15] except being challenged by the
[1:50:18] angels that protected the throne right
[1:50:21] next to God
[1:50:23] in this great esteemed place that God
[1:50:27] had created and made
[1:50:31] him and yet the Bible tells
[1:50:35] you as we read it said that that that he
[1:50:40] was perfect in all his ways a lot of
[1:50:42] people come up with this mistaken idea
[1:50:45] that God created evil so he put all his
[1:50:48] evil Parts in Satan no God didn't create
[1:50:52] evil
[1:50:53] God created things that became
[1:50:56] evil he made Satan with a ability to
[1:51:00] make
[1:51:04] choices and who knows it could have been
[1:51:08] ages in eternity cuz time was not
[1:51:11] counted that he was a faithful
[1:51:16] servant carrying out the orders helping
[1:51:20] God as his right-hand man
[1:51:23] but
[1:51:24] somewhere somewhere along the line Pride
[1:51:27] came into his
[1:51:29] heart and he began to glory in the
[1:51:32] person that he was oh Pride's an awful
[1:51:37] thing amen Pride will make you where you
[1:51:39] don't think you need God this is why
[1:51:42] people don't
[1:51:44] pray Pride will make a place where you
[1:51:47] won't even ask God for healing because
[1:51:49] you can make it on yourself
[1:51:53] Pride will come into a place where you
[1:51:55] know you will even esteem you your your
[1:51:58] own unworthiness bigger than what God
[1:52:02] can
[1:52:07] deliver you see you see again all of
[1:52:10] these things and and can play into pride
[1:52:15] and and then and Isaiah
[1:52:17] 14:12 he he ask the question how AR I
[1:52:21] fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer how did
[1:52:23] you
[1:52:24] fall son of the
[1:52:27] morning how AR you cut down to the
[1:52:30] ground which did as weak as the
[1:52:33] Nations for thou H has said in thine
[1:52:37] heart I will Ascend into heaven I will
[1:52:41] exalt my throne above the stars of God I
[1:52:43] will sit also upon the Mount of the
[1:52:45] congregation in the sides of the
[1:52:49] north I will Ascend above the heights of
[1:52:51] the clouds I will be like the most
[1:52:54] high yet thou shall be brought down to
[1:52:57] Hell to the sides of the pit and they
[1:53:00] that shall see thee that see thee shall
[1:53:03] narrowly look upon thee and consider
[1:53:05] thee saying is this the man that made
[1:53:07] the Earth to tremble that did shake the
[1:53:09] kingdoms that made the Earth as the
[1:53:12] world as a Wilderness that destroyed the
[1:53:14] cities thereof that open not the house
[1:53:16] of his
[1:53:18] prisoners so it shows you know here was
[1:53:22] here was was his sting you know you know
[1:53:24] hairs were his fault how did you fall he
[1:53:28] fell because of Pride he ex he exalted
[1:53:33] himself you see you know Paul says this
[1:53:36] of Satan you know when when he warned
[1:53:39] the novice the new convert said don't be
[1:53:42] like the devil for he was lifted up with
[1:53:45] pride and fell into
[1:53:50] condemnation so you see how how did he
[1:53:52] fall because of Pride and jealousy he
[1:53:55] desired to be God not just to be a
[1:53:58] servant of
[1:53:59] God oh I've seen it over over and over
[1:54:03] again I've seen men who started out in
[1:54:06] the race you know to
[1:54:08] be a person of of character a protector
[1:54:12] of the word and they were given a little
[1:54:15] congregation a people and first thing
[1:54:17] you know more is given to them and
[1:54:19] whatever and they finally get lifted up
[1:54:21] and pride where they're above the word
[1:54:24] they're above everything else they can't
[1:54:27] take
[1:54:28] correction this can happen with deacons
[1:54:31] trustees it can happen in a church it
[1:54:33] can happen in a family it can happen
[1:54:35] with a
[1:54:37] wife amen when God gave a man to be the
[1:54:41] head of the home and she will war
[1:54:44] against his
[1:54:47] headship what is it because they become
[1:54:50] lifted up with pride
[1:54:52] and because of jealousy a
[1:54:55] position and you see you see he desired
[1:54:59] to be God not just be a servant of God
[1:55:03] he said I'll sit I'll sit in the
[1:55:07] congregation I will sit in the
[1:55:10] church I'll have a church too I will be
[1:55:14] worshiped
[1:55:16] also look how great I am I'm perfect in
[1:55:20] all my ways look at what has been put
[1:55:23] into me what I have the carbuncles the
[1:55:26] gold the sapphire the diamonds all the
[1:55:30] glitter and everything to Beauty look
[1:55:33] who I am look how great I
[1:55:37] am and he follow forgot that real
[1:55:39] greatness is in
[1:55:42] humility and friends that's where our
[1:55:44] greatness is it's not because we can
[1:55:48] puff out our chest and say I'm the bride
[1:55:50] of Christ forward came before the
[1:55:52] Foundation the world you know everybody
[1:55:54] look to me no but it's in humility that
[1:55:57] we show ourselves the bride accepting
[1:56:00] his
[1:56:01] headship what he says above our own
[1:56:06] ideas exalting his word above our own
[1:56:09] thoughts about the opinions of the world
[1:56:12] about the culture that we live
[1:56:14] in while our culture we do this or that
[1:56:17] forget your culture your culture is
[1:56:20] going to hell with the rest of the
[1:56:21] culture
[1:56:22] amen there's only one culture going to
[1:56:24] make it and that's Heaven's culture and
[1:56:26] you got to be born again to be a part of
[1:56:28] that
[1:56:29] culture amen so you see again Paul Paul
[1:56:34] you know says that the devil was lifted
[1:56:37] up with pride and he fell into
[1:56:40] condemnation he began to say I
[1:56:43] will I will this is the root of all
[1:56:48] sin where I self can gets exalted over
[1:56:54] God's
[1:56:55] word well I don't think who are you to
[1:57:01] think well it's my
[1:57:03] opinion and God sent a Vindicated
[1:57:07] prophet and you want to argue with that
[1:57:10] you know why because you're too big in
[1:57:14] your own
[1:57:17] eyes you're too
[1:57:19] great you become great
[1:57:25] somebody just wrote me
[1:57:27] recently and I don't want to give the
[1:57:29] devil any
[1:57:32] recognition but he you know wrote me and
[1:57:35] you know I I knew what he wanted he sent
[1:57:37] me a whole deal on his his his thoughts
[1:57:41] I've left the message and this is why
[1:57:44] because you know Malachi 4 is not not
[1:57:47] for the bride is not to be fulfilled in
[1:57:49] the last day and there's no such thing
[1:57:51] as Elijah well all you've done is
[1:57:54] spotted out what all the theologians
[1:57:57] say and none of them have
[1:58:02] Vindication why would I listen to you I
[1:58:04] don't have a minute for that a
[1:58:08] second I'll tell you what I tell you
[1:58:10] what it went to I mean I see I I get a
[1:58:13] whole a whole package of it and I don't
[1:58:16] even open it I throw it in the trash why
[1:58:19] it's not worthy it's not worthy of my
[1:58:21] time
[1:58:24] I'll help anybody that wants to know but
[1:58:26] is I am not going to argue this message
[1:58:29] with the
[1:58:30] devil amen the message is true My Mind
[1:58:33] Is Made Up and you're not going to
[1:58:35] convince me
[1:58:39] otherwise you can have your argument
[1:58:42] they all do they have Arguments for the
[1:58:43] Trinity they have Arguments for multiple
[1:58:45] gods they got Arguments for Muhammad
[1:58:48] they got Arguments for for Buddha they
[1:58:50] got Arguments for all they oh the devil
[1:58:53] has this argument we have
[1:58:59] life that's what I say let me show you
[1:59:03] what the message does for young
[1:59:05] people let me tell you show you what it
[1:59:08] does for
[1:59:09] couples what it does with how it makes
[1:59:12] fathers real
[1:59:14] men women real
[1:59:17] ladies children real model citizens
[1:59:22] bursts them into the kingdom gives a
[1:59:24] character that is can't be compared with
[1:59:27] the
[1:59:31] world
[1:59:35] so so we
[1:59:37] see all the many statements of I
[1:59:41] will already now here's the first
[1:59:44] sin your
[1:59:46] will above God's will
[1:59:54] now Ezekiel 28 describes Satan as this
[1:59:59] exceedingly beautiful
[2:00:01] angel perhaps the highest of all the
[2:00:04] Angels the anointed cherub the most
[2:00:07] beautiful of all God's creation but not
[2:00:11] content in his
[2:00:12] position instead he desired to be God or
[2:00:16] essentially to overthrow God off his
[2:00:19] throne and take rule over the universe
[2:00:25] and Satan's purpose from Eden was to
[2:00:28] make his own Sean
[2:00:30] Eden as he walked upon Eden and looked
[2:00:34] around he thinks of what could I make
[2:00:37] out of
[2:00:40] this God has a plan and his plan is
[2:00:44] heaven to be
[2:00:47] here but I also have a plan and I will
[2:00:53] will and I will make this Earth my own
[2:00:57] kingdom and I will rule
[2:01:01] here and these hearts of men I will rule
[2:01:05] over these Hearts sir and they will
[2:01:08] worship me said well I don't worship the
[2:01:10] devil anytime you exalt yourself and
[2:01:13] others over God's word you are
[2:01:15] worshiping
[2:01:19] Satan Satan's purpose was exalt himself
[2:01:23] above the stars of God so stars of God
[2:01:25] would the sons would worship him and
[2:01:28] he's absolutely carried it out and he's
[2:01:31] done this and he brought it right into
[2:01:33] the church the Bible said he would be so
[2:01:36] successful that he would actually sit in
[2:01:39] the temple of God and be worshiped as
[2:01:43] God and and so you see he has done this
[2:01:47] by educational programs by the society
[2:01:51] around is by creating an atmosphere of
[2:01:55] unbelief that people immerse themselves
[2:01:58] in every
[2:02:01] day you have to to live
[2:02:04] here you're immersed into this Society
[2:02:08] in the opinions of this world you war
[2:02:11] against those
[2:02:14] opinions there's a fight that's going on
[2:02:18] all the time a
[2:02:20] war between what the world says and what
[2:02:23] God
[2:02:25] says and there we know that even Many
[2:02:30] religious men you know that become blind
[2:02:32] leaders of the blind blind leaders of of
[2:02:36] science then and blind leaders of the
[2:02:38] church and blind leaders of the of the
[2:02:42] Nations the blind leading the
[2:02:46] blind I know we think sometimes oh we
[2:02:48] got us some a messiah there in
[2:02:50] Washington you know God a great leader
[2:02:53] listen he's not a great
[2:02:55] leader the great leader is the Holy
[2:02:59] Ghost amen the only thing that he can
[2:03:02] lead our nation into is more
[2:03:08] ration the only hope is not in this
[2:03:12] government but of a king that is
[2:03:17] coming now Satan wanted to be God and
[2:03:20] instantly it interestly thing enough
[2:03:22] that desire is what Satan tempted Adam
[2:03:26] and Eve within the garden don't you know
[2:03:29] if you you will be as Gods knowing
[2:03:33] knowing all
[2:03:34] things so they he gets they get tempted
[2:03:37] with the same thing and because of
[2:03:39] Satan's sin God cast him out of heaven
[2:03:43] and let me just say heaven is not
[2:03:46] Satan's rightful place it is no place
[2:03:49] for the wicked one that's right amen
[2:03:52] Satan
[2:03:53] fell originally he fell because he was
[2:03:57] pushed God pushed him
[2:04:00] out and he fell and he fell to the
[2:04:07] earth now I want you to know there's an
[2:04:09] end time picture that shows where he
[2:04:11] falls
[2:04:12] again this time his fall will be
[2:04:16] permanent he'll never get back into
[2:04:19] heaven and in Revelation chapter 9 and
[2:04:21] you see he's a star that falls from
[2:04:24] heaven and he's given a key to the
[2:04:26] bottomless pit with our permission to
[2:04:28] open the bottomless pit and and release
[2:04:31] 300 million Supernatural
[2:04:35] demons to be a part of the Endtime
[2:04:37] battle to gather his host together which
[2:04:40] is what happens after Satan is cast
[2:04:43] out he brings them all together all this
[2:04:47] happens in conjunction with the coming
[2:04:49] of the Lord for after the fall of Satan
[2:04:52] and the identification of abadian apolon
[2:04:56] the king of the bottomless pit found in
[2:04:59] Revelation nine where he where he falls
[2:05:02] from heaven where he's cast down amen
[2:05:05] there is a conjunction that starts in
[2:05:07] Revelation 10 verse1 if you look at that
[2:05:10] with me for a moment Revelation 10 verse
[2:05:12] one I want you to watch the wording here
[2:05:15] and I
[2:05:19] saw notice this scripture begins with
[2:05:23] and connecting it with Revelation
[2:05:26] chapter N9 so the fall of Satan is
[2:05:30] connected with the coming of
[2:05:35] Christ
[2:05:37] hallelujah amen because as one comes for
[2:05:40] us the other falls to the
[2:05:43] Earth because heaven has to be cleansed
[2:05:46] to the accuser in order for the for the
[2:05:49] Brethren to come there amen
[2:05:53] right now watch as we look at here I saw
[2:05:57] another Mighty Angel come down so it
[2:06:00] begins connecting the two Revelation 9
[2:06:04] and Revelation 10 together so when you
[2:06:07] read Revelation 10 is not complete
[2:06:09] without Revelation 9 there is a casting
[2:06:11] down of
[2:06:14] Satan and there is the coming down of
[2:06:17] Christ amen where Heaven is coming down
[2:06:20] is being expanded for the purpose of
[2:06:25] redemption notice now as we look it's
[2:06:28] all a part of the End Time battle it
[2:06:30] happens in conjunction with the coming
[2:06:32] of the Lord after the fall of Satan so
[2:06:35] Revelation 10 shows the continuation of
[2:06:38] the same
[2:06:39] scene so Satan was kicked out of heaven
[2:06:43] so how does he get back
[2:06:45] in well we know what he
[2:06:49] is of course he's the deceiver of course
[2:06:53] he's the serpent the old serpent from
[2:06:56] the beginning the one that deceived Eve
[2:06:58] that got the whole world in the
[2:07:01] confusion that is in of course we know
[2:07:04] all of that but he is titly is accuser
[2:07:09] of the Brethren that's what he's there
[2:07:13] for he is there as your
[2:07:19] accuser trying to keep you out of the
[2:07:24] position that Jesus paid for and it is
[2:07:28] rightly yours as a son or daughter of
[2:07:37] God so he stands between you and your
[2:07:42] sunship your full authority to resist
[2:07:50] you we know that he's accuser of the
[2:07:52] brother he shows accusing
[2:07:55] job we know he opposed Joshua the priest
[2:07:58] the high priest and zechariah's prophecy
[2:08:01] stood at his right
[2:08:03] hand to oppose
[2:08:06] him and man we know he's there you know
[2:08:10] and there was the cosmic battles in the
[2:08:13] air in the
[2:08:14] heavens hindering the answer to Daniel's
[2:08:17] prayer holding back trying to keep back
[2:08:21] the angel with the
[2:08:23] message and if it wasn't for the
[2:08:25] intercessory work of Michael he would
[2:08:27] have never got
[2:08:28] through but right now even in this age
[2:08:31] Satan and his highest ranking angels can
[2:08:34] still oppose the work of God and hinder
[2:08:37] the angels of God fighting over Heavenly
[2:08:40] positions wording off the blessings of
[2:08:43] God trying to stand between you and God
[2:08:47] and the Fulfillment of his word and
[2:08:49] promise in your life right
[2:08:52] trying to hold back the answer from
[2:08:54] you first of all let's remember the
[2:08:58] original man's rule before the
[2:09:00] fall let's remember Adam was a Son of
[2:09:03] God he
[2:09:04] was he was one who ruled over the
[2:09:08] Earth he did this from a position from a
[2:09:11] throne a dominion and we're not talking
[2:09:14] about an ivory Throne we're not talking
[2:09:17] about a Golden Throne we're not talking
[2:09:19] about a physical Throne we're talking
[2:09:21] about a
[2:09:23] position a place of dominion and this is
[2:09:26] where Adam Ruled the Earth was from from
[2:09:30] a position of sunship as a Son of God
[2:09:34] given Authority by the word of God the
[2:09:37] word had given them
[2:09:41] Dominion I want you to lose sight of
[2:09:43] that because the word is also giv you
[2:09:47] Dominion as sons of God we are to take
[2:09:50] dominion over sin
[2:09:52] over sickness over the
[2:09:54] devil we are people who are to have
[2:09:58] dominion we are to be people who who who
[2:10:03] who operate from the Heavenly Realms not
[2:10:06] the Realms of our
[2:10:08] feelings not the Realms of our
[2:10:11] emotions not the Realms of our human
[2:10:13] Spirit but the Realms where our soul is
[2:10:17] in the presence of God and there we see
[2:10:20] things as God sees and we're content
[2:10:22] with what God has in our life at this
[2:10:26] moment waiting for any change he deems
[2:10:37] possible this is what we call
[2:10:40] sunship and it's what we lost in the
[2:10:42] fall that's right because of the Fall we
[2:10:46] lost our rightful
[2:10:48] birth instead of being born right we
[2:10:51] were born
[2:10:53] wrong and we were birthed into sin and
[2:10:56] death with Satan and sin being our
[2:10:59] ruler this is why we must be born
[2:11:06] again because this this flesh this Blood
[2:11:11] this birth cannot inherit the kingdom of
[2:11:16] God we must be born
[2:11:18] again so man was made a second secondary
[2:11:21] God on the earth given power to control
[2:11:25] all things all the elements of the
[2:11:28] earth Adam was given these great Powers
[2:11:31] but then the power he was given he was
[2:11:34] given to make a choice and it was in
[2:11:36] that choice that he
[2:11:38] fell now remember Adam controlled the
[2:11:42] atmosphere he controlled the era of Eden
[2:11:46] it was one of a place of
[2:11:49] Tranquility of peace
[2:11:51] he could speak to the winds and they
[2:11:53] would obey him he could speak to the
[2:11:55] trees and they would be removed as Jesus
[2:11:58] said if you said to this tree this sacan
[2:12:01] tree saine tree be plucked up and cast
[2:12:04] in the sea it will be done even as you
[2:12:06] said Adam did
[2:12:08] that he could speak to the waters
[2:12:11] everything obeyed
[2:12:13] Adam now that was man in his
[2:12:16] Beginnings God gave him power over all
[2:12:19] the Earth but now through the fall he
[2:12:22] lost that power and he became
[2:12:25] unconscious of the fact of his of his
[2:12:29] right to
[2:12:31] Dominion because he Lo because because
[2:12:34] it's only in fellowship and relation and
[2:12:38] friendship with God and the word in the
[2:12:41] proper place does these things
[2:12:45] work so he lost that and the great
[2:12:47] channels all became clogged up even in
[2:12:50] our in where that where where it became
[2:12:54] Veil to us of of of what God really made
[2:12:58] us to be but we were created to be gods
[2:13:02] in His image to rule with
[2:13:06] Dominion
[2:13:07] Hallelujah but we were cheated out of it
[2:13:11] I want you to know we were cheated out
[2:13:13] of it that
[2:13:14] deceiver that old serpent called the
[2:13:17] devil cheated us out of our true
[2:13:19] inheritance we love lost it by not by
[2:13:24] not
[2:13:26] fairness it wasn't a fair
[2:13:28] deal that's why it's a contested
[2:13:33] book it wasn't a fair deal the devil
[2:13:36] did it was a shady deal he
[2:13:40] lied he sold Eve a bill of
[2:13:44] goods he was dishonest in the
[2:13:47] transaction and Satan's dirty hand
[2:13:49] couldn't take it and become a contested
[2:13:51] book and it goes in the hand of God and
[2:13:54] God is holding it until one a man can
[2:13:57] come that's worthy to claim
[2:14:02] it so sunship is withheld and the Power
[2:14:07] of
[2:14:07] sunship Now when God had made man he got
[2:14:11] down in the
[2:14:13] dirt and formed a and shaped a human
[2:14:16] body from
[2:14:17] clay he breathed his own life and to
[2:14:21] that man's nostrils Man became a living
[2:14:25] Soul he called the man Adam that man had
[2:14:28] a different life from that of plants and
[2:14:31] of animals he had been created in God's
[2:14:34] Own
[2:14:35] image which means he possessed an
[2:14:38] immortal Spirit like God
[2:14:42] has and he was designed to be like God
[2:14:45] to fellowship with God to reason like
[2:14:49] God to believe like God God and enjoy
[2:14:52] God
[2:14:54] forever if you're in the dolrs today if
[2:14:57] you're in Sorrows if you are in pity if
[2:15:01] you are in in in in frustration you're
[2:15:05] not in fellowship with God it's only
[2:15:08] when you're in fellowship with God that
[2:15:10] you have peace and you have
[2:15:13] contentment but when you get out of
[2:15:15] fellowship with him then you become
[2:15:18] frustrated and angry and Confused and
[2:15:27] that and Satan is casting you
[2:15:30] down and pummeling you but I want you to
[2:15:34] know that is not your
[2:15:37] heritage that's not who you ordained to
[2:15:39] be if I could whisper if I could shout
[2:15:42] in your ears today I would say you are
[2:15:46] not a defeated person you you are not
[2:15:49] meant to be controlled
[2:15:51] by depression by unbelief by doubt by
[2:15:55] fear by confusion but you have been
[2:15:59] predestined and chosen to be possessed
[2:16:02] and controlled by faith and Love and
[2:16:16] Hope Satan was kicked out of
[2:16:19] heaven so he comes down to
[2:16:22] earth he wants to be like
[2:16:26] God his loss of
[2:16:29] position didn't stop
[2:16:32] him he's more determined than
[2:16:35] ever I'll find a way
[2:16:38] back I will be like
[2:16:42] God I will have a
[2:16:45] place God's not pushing me out of heaven
[2:16:49] I'm coming back
[2:16:52] I'll rule over
[2:16:54] man that's what I'll
[2:16:56] do here he has Heaven down on Earth and
[2:17:00] a man living in heaven and operating
[2:17:03] from Heavenly places of
[2:17:06] sunship making all of
[2:17:09] life subservient to the spirit of God
[2:17:13] and there's Harmony and there's peace
[2:17:15] and the tranquility and the the lion
[2:17:18] lays down by the lamb and there's no
[2:17:20] trouble there's nothing hard to destroy
[2:17:22] in all of
[2:17:25] Eden but I will
[2:17:30] Ascend and he
[2:17:33] finds there's a susceptible
[2:17:36] creature susceptible to his thoughts and
[2:17:40] his
[2:17:41] plans that he can
[2:17:44] actually that he actually this serpent
[2:17:47] so like
[2:17:48] man so close to to man that he's almost
[2:17:53] a twined
[2:17:54] man but he
[2:17:57] lacks a
[2:18:03] soul no certain
[2:18:05] nature so Satan enters
[2:18:15] in and
[2:18:17] now this
[2:18:19] one begins to speak the voice of
[2:18:28] Satan I don't know where Adam was that
[2:18:32] day maybe in another part of the
[2:18:36] domain there had never been anything to
[2:18:38] fear
[2:18:45] before sometimes I wonder and this is
[2:18:47] maybe my human thinking
[2:18:50] but with
[2:18:52] Dominion knowing that Satan had been
[2:18:55] cast out of Heaven why didn't he cast
[2:18:57] him out of
[2:19:01] Earth but here he
[2:19:04] comes and now he finds a place in a
[2:19:06] beast and a living creature a man like
[2:19:10] being that can reason talk stands
[2:19:13] upright his seed can actually mix with
[2:19:18] man and he begins to annoy
[2:19:26] him and through his beg Godless he
[2:19:30] begins to talk
[2:19:32] Eve so here he can't
[2:19:36] create so he can't go over and just have
[2:19:39] I'll create me an
[2:19:40] earth I'll make me a earth and I'll just
[2:19:43] I'll just have Satan's eating on it I'll
[2:19:45] tell you what I I've got this plan I'm
[2:19:47] going to be God over they'll all worship
[2:19:49] me and I you know no he can't
[2:19:55] create so he begins to work on what God
[2:19:59] has to pervert the
[2:20:03] Earth and in order to pervert the Earth
[2:20:06] he perverts
[2:20:11] man so Satan's
[2:20:14] schem let's review it Isaiah
[2:20:18] 14:13 for thou has said in thine heart I
[2:20:22] will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my
[2:20:25] Dominion my throne above the stars of
[2:20:27] God and this is exactly now what he does
[2:20:31] with the serpent he begins to exalt
[2:20:35] dominion over Adam's
[2:20:41] wife don't you know second Eve that's
[2:20:44] what he wants to do to
[2:20:46] you just get you to disbelieve the word
[2:20:53] and here he comes here he comes I will
[2:20:55] exalt my Dominion above the stars of God
[2:20:58] I will sit on the Mount of the
[2:20:59] congregation I will be worshiped I will
[2:21:02] Ascend above the heights of the cloud I
[2:21:05] will be like the most high I will take
[2:21:08] his place in their
[2:21:12] hearts and he came to Eve and the
[2:21:15] serpent speaks to him and
[2:21:19] suggested ah God has not really
[2:21:22] forbidden the
[2:21:24] fruit for your good I mean but he's
[2:21:27] rather he's really trying to keep good
[2:21:29] from
[2:21:30] you you see he's withholding
[2:21:34] knowledge you you know there there's
[2:21:36] things Secrets there that you don't know
[2:21:40] that only God does and he's holding you
[2:21:43] from really
[2:21:44] being like
[2:21:48] God so Eve
[2:21:52] go around what God
[2:21:55] Said and take
[2:22:01] this and you'll be as God and you know
[2:22:04] everything then that God
[2:22:15] knows you know that's our problem a lot
[2:22:19] of times we want to know the future or
[2:22:22] we want to know Wise or we want to know
[2:22:25] how
[2:22:27] comes and yet those things belong to God
[2:22:31] and to whom he will reveal
[2:22:33] it but when you start trying to figure
[2:22:37] it out and you get frustrated with God
[2:22:41] because of where you are in
[2:22:44] life because of troubles in life and you
[2:22:49] get frustrated you know you see what you
[2:22:51] are doing is exalting yourself rather
[2:22:53] than just humbling yourself to the will
[2:22:55] of God and say God you have me here and
[2:22:57] I'm going to be content where I'm at for
[2:22:59] why I'm here for this moment I don't
[2:23:01] understand it but I don't have to
[2:23:03] understand I just have to trust
[2:23:09] you and I know that
[2:23:14] everything that is not Eternal is
[2:23:18] temporal and so you know it's like I
[2:23:21] told a young girl one time that was
[2:23:23] having some trouble in her home and
[2:23:25] whatever else and and she's approaching
[2:23:27] you know life and and whatever I say
[2:23:31] well you know I know you're
[2:23:33] frustrated and I know you're having
[2:23:35] situations here that are uncomfortable
[2:23:38] and ain't good but let me just tell
[2:23:41] you it won't always be this
[2:23:44] way there's coming a change there's a
[2:23:48] light at the end of the tunnel you won't
[2:23:50] always be in this
[2:23:53] position so what do you do right now in
[2:23:56] this position act as a Christian under
[2:24:00] the duress of where you're
[2:24:03] at behave as a daughter of God as a
[2:24:07] child of God no matter how difficult it
[2:24:10] is and say Lord you trusted me with this
[2:24:14] trial I don't know when I'm coming out I
[2:24:17] just know it's temporary because is
[2:24:20] temporary trouble is temporary sin is
[2:24:24] temporary that anything outside of God
[2:24:27] is only temporary and I will be here
[2:24:30] still overcoming when all temporary
[2:24:33] things is over with and
[2:24:40] gone the lack I'm having the problem I'm
[2:24:44] going through it's only
[2:24:47] temporary the trials you're going
[2:24:49] through are temporary trials the trouble
[2:24:53] that you're going through with your
[2:24:54] health is a temporary trial one day my
[2:24:58] trials will be over there's a light at
[2:25:01] the end of the tunnel amen I see a new
[2:25:03] body headed my way I'm going to be Chang
[2:25:06] in a moment and a twinkling of eye
[2:25:09] everything ain't perfect here but I'm
[2:25:11] headed toward
[2:25:14] Perfection
[2:25:18] Hallelujah Satan came to eat even and
[2:25:20] the serpent speaks through himy
[2:25:23] suggested that God had not really
[2:25:26] forbidden it ah you'll be his God then
[2:25:29] you'll know
[2:25:31] everything we don't know everything
[2:25:35] here but then we'll know as we are
[2:25:38] known we will understand it better by
[2:25:42] and by there's a light at the end of the
[2:25:45] tunnel It won't always be this way
[2:25:50] as brother Timothy quoted and I've
[2:25:52] quoted from Brother bram's words in
[2:25:55] Mother's Day He said one day when is all
[2:25:59] over and our as we sitting around the
[2:26:02] table and tears coming down our face
[2:26:05] Maybe remembering the things we've been
[2:26:09] through the horrible
[2:26:13] Horrors bad things happen to good
[2:26:18] people you may be fatherless but you're
[2:26:21] not the only
[2:26:22] one lots have been
[2:26:24] fatherless might be motherless but
[2:26:26] you're not the only one many have been
[2:26:30] motherless you might be without a spouse
[2:26:33] but you're not the only one there's been
[2:26:38] many why is it how
[2:26:42] come and there in that
[2:26:45] moment he said he'll take his Majestic
[2:26:49] fingers
[2:26:51] and untie the knots that's all knotted
[2:26:54] up in your brain of why how come this
[2:26:58] had happen to me why why did I why did I
[2:27:02] lose a wife at 45 years of marriage how
[2:27:05] come how couldn't she couldn't be with
[2:27:07] me in my older age and where is my
[2:27:10] comfort and why where is my joy and how
[2:27:12] come and Lord what did I do and all of
[2:27:15] them things that are in your mind will
[2:27:17] be
[2:27:18] unscrambled and untied
[2:27:21] and you'll
[2:27:22] see oh oh
[2:27:26] lord it's nothing to be compared with
[2:27:29] what I
[2:27:30] have let me just forget it all and just
[2:27:34] realize Lord that in it all you proved
[2:27:37] your life in
[2:27:40] me but you see after the fall of Man are
[2:27:44] you
[2:27:45] tired I hope
[2:27:48] not you know I to follow man God drove
[2:27:52] Adam and Eve out of the garden placed a
[2:27:53] cherub to guard the entrance and Adam
[2:27:57] Eve couldn't couldn't return and eat
[2:27:59] from the Tree of Life and live forever
[2:28:02] in that cursed State God made sure they
[2:28:04] couldn't there they were forced to find
[2:28:07] their own food and shelter Adam would
[2:28:10] have to F fight weeds and thistles to
[2:28:13] eat out an existance on the
[2:28:16] ground even what he want control
[2:28:21] rebelled against
[2:28:23] him he would plant seed for weeds to
[2:28:26] come
[2:28:27] up
[2:28:28] misplaced vegetation that would have
[2:28:30] been beautiful in this setting but out
[2:28:33] of his place now because when Satan
[2:28:35] comes in there always
[2:28:39] chaos and he would take it and he would
[2:28:43] speak to it say okay you're a beautiful
[2:28:45] plant here but you're in the wrong place
[2:28:47] here you're a weed but if I put you over
[2:28:49] here you'll be right in your right place
[2:28:51] and shine in your beauty but here where
[2:28:54] I have this I want this to grow
[2:28:57] unhindered but now all nature Rebels
[2:29:00] against
[2:29:05] him Adam gave up the power of the spoken
[2:29:10] word you know why for his
[2:29:14] bride Adam was not
[2:29:18] deceived he knew what he was given up
[2:29:22] I'll give up Immortal Life I'll give up
[2:29:26] the power of the spoken word I'll give
[2:29:28] up Dominion to how Satan rule over
[2:29:32] me but I'll do it for my
[2:29:40] wife this is another Adam 2,000 years
[2:29:45] ago he gave up all the glory all of
[2:29:48] Heaven to come to Earth to take on your
[2:29:52] sin he didn't commit the sin he took
[2:29:55] your sin he bore it to
[2:29:58] Calvary he paid the price of redemption
[2:30:01] he walked out and went to hell with your
[2:30:04] sin so you wouldn't have to pay for them
[2:30:08] so you could be
[2:30:10] free Adam would go out with Eve there
[2:30:14] and as they're going out to curse
[2:30:17] people the Earth is cursed
[2:30:20] for your sake
[2:30:25] Adam even your flesh will grow thorns
[2:30:28] and
[2:30:34] thistles
[2:30:35] woman your womb will be
[2:30:39] cursed your conception will be
[2:30:43] multiplied you'll have
[2:30:46] twins you'll conceived from both The
[2:30:48] Serpent and Adam
[2:30:51] amen and in sorrow you bring forth
[2:30:53] children and pains of childbirth it
[2:30:56] won't be by the power of the spoken word
[2:30:58] it'll be with pain and groaning that
[2:31:00] should bring life into the
[2:31:03] world and man will be born of sorrow in
[2:31:06] a few days full of
[2:31:12] trouble he was grown from the time he's
[2:31:14] here to the time he leaves
[2:31:20] suffering and toil became part of the
[2:31:23] curse that God put on the world because
[2:31:25] of
[2:31:26] sin now Satan's getting into
[2:31:29] animals and they begin to kill each
[2:31:32] other Adam has no power to stop
[2:31:35] it before there was a nature rose up in
[2:31:39] the lion he was always a lion but
[2:31:41] something rose up in him and his place
[2:31:43] it down boy that's
[2:31:46] enough The Lion and the lamb would lay
[2:31:48] down together
[2:31:51] Adam had
[2:31:53] Dominion but now Adam can't stop
[2:32:01] it now chaos
[2:32:04] Reigns through the atmosphere of the
[2:32:07] air it's charged the atmosphere the air
[2:32:10] is now charged with
[2:32:12] fear faith hope the love of God which
[2:32:16] once dominated the atmosphere was now
[2:32:19] gone it had
[2:32:21] evaporated and sin now covered the
[2:32:24] Earth this episode in human history is
[2:32:27] called the fall of Man and it's because
[2:32:30] of an act of Disobedience where Adam
[2:32:32] brought a curse on every person every
[2:32:36] person that was yet to be
[2:32:40] born the man who was designed to walk
[2:32:43] with God and unbroken Fellowship had
[2:32:45] fallen from that exalted position now he
[2:32:49] was D doomed to live in a broken state
[2:32:53] in a broken World apart from from
[2:32:57] communion with
[2:32:59] God and as he goes out God says wait a
[2:33:05] minute I've cursed the ground I've
[2:33:08] cursed the
[2:33:09] womb I've expelled you from the garden
[2:33:13] but I'm going with you and I'm going to
[2:33:16] be a seed that will come through the
[2:33:18] woman and there will be a seed that will
[2:33:20] come one day and will bruise the head of
[2:33:22] this
[2:33:24] serpent there's coming an end to the
[2:33:27] rule of
[2:33:28] Satan way man his is his his reain will
[2:33:32] one day be
[2:33:36] over but the temporary
[2:33:39] Earthly consequences of sin
[2:33:43] remains even
[2:33:47] now even now
[2:33:51] we all
[2:33:52] suffer from the consequences of the
[2:33:55] fall through that one man's Sin Sin came
[2:33:59] in the
[2:34:00] world Romans 5 says as Sin entered the
[2:34:03] world through one man and death through
[2:34:05] sin and in this way death came to all
[2:34:07] people because all
[2:34:10] sin for at the many died by the trespass
[2:34:13] of one man how much more did God's grace
[2:34:16] and the gift that came by the grace of
[2:34:18] one man Jesus Christ Christ overflow to
[2:34:22] many so our Salvation comes by calling
[2:34:25] on the name of the Lord by trusting
[2:34:27] accepted and and re receiving his
[2:34:30] perfect sacrifice for our sins and
[2:34:33] receiving the life and the nature of our
[2:34:35] sacrifice Jesus Christ to
[2:34:40] us but the world today groans under the
[2:34:44] curse he crying out for
[2:34:47] Relief that will come at the altar imate
[2:34:51] Redemption of God's people when Christ
[2:34:55] returns Paul calls us the Redemption of
[2:34:57] our
[2:34:58] bodies where we'll no longer be in this
[2:35:01] cursed
[2:35:02] Earth but be
[2:35:05] changed when Jesus comes he'll restore
[2:35:07] all things he will create a new heavens
[2:35:10] and a new Earth to re renew that which
[2:35:13] sin destroyed man will no longer be
[2:35:17] fallen but he'll be restored and
[2:35:20] Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb so
[2:35:22] right now all creation groans and not
[2:35:25] only creation but we ourselves who have
[2:35:27] the first fruits of the spirit our souls
[2:35:30] are redeemed but yet we still grown
[2:35:34] inwardly as we wait e eagerly for that
[2:35:37] full and complete adoption of
[2:35:40] sons that is the Redemption of our
[2:35:44] bodies so the Bible
[2:35:47] says in Ephesians chapter 2
[2:35:51] and you ha he made
[2:35:54] alive you has he quickened verse one who
[2:35:59] were dead in sins and
[2:36:02] trespasses where in time pass you walked
[2:36:05] according to the course of this world
[2:36:07] according to the prince of the power of
[2:36:10] the
[2:36:11] air the spirit that now worketh in the
[2:36:14] children of Disobedience among among
[2:36:17] whom we also had our own life our own
[2:36:20] conversation the way we lived in times
[2:36:23] past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling
[2:36:25] the desires of the Flesh and the mind
[2:36:28] and we by Nature the children of Wrath
[2:36:31] even as others and the and the Apostle
[2:36:33] Paul uh describes Satan now as a prince
[2:36:38] a prince with
[2:36:39] power because he has authentic power in
[2:36:42] the world first John 5:19 he says we
[2:36:45] know we are from God and the whole world
[2:36:49] lies
[2:36:50] in the power of the evil
[2:36:53] one that's the condition of the world
[2:36:55] that we live in the whole world lives in
[2:36:58] the power of the evil one his power is
[2:37:01] not only over nature to stir the
[2:37:03] atmospheres above to cause the Winds of
[2:37:05] tornadoes a horrible storm but also to
[2:37:07] cause storms and Winds of strife and
[2:37:10] disturb our own human
[2:37:15] nature not only that he owns the
[2:37:17] kingdoms of the world and and he's stirs
[2:37:19] up chaos and strife and causes great
[2:37:23] suffering all over the
[2:37:25] world why did AAS rise up against the
[2:37:28] people of God and with such Vengeance
[2:37:31] and hate and and animosity and kill
[2:37:34] little babies and women mothers with
[2:37:37] children you know the beus family and
[2:37:39] with those gorgeous little red-headed
[2:37:41] children and and just murder
[2:37:44] them
[2:37:46] why
[2:37:48] Satan has control of the world and over
[2:37:52] people and over atmospheres and he's
[2:37:55] there causing Wars and strife and Russia
[2:37:59] raises up against Ukraine and Ukraine
[2:38:01] here and and America there and this and
[2:38:03] there and all of the world is in
[2:38:07] turmoil because why Satan is the
[2:38:11] God of this of this age but he's more
[2:38:14] than that he is the prince of the power
[2:38:17] of atmospheres
[2:38:20] and where did he get this
[2:38:22] power I want to ask you where did he get
[2:38:25] it where did he get the authority to do
[2:38:28] this how did he get this
[2:38:31] rule well let's go to Luke 4 and verse 6
[2:38:34] and I'll give you scripture and the
[2:38:36] devil said unto Jesus all this power
[2:38:39] will I give to thee and the glory of
[2:38:42] them for that is delivered to me and to
[2:38:45] whomsoever I will I will give it
[2:38:50] so now we find out where he got it was
[2:38:53] delivered to
[2:38:55] him well God didn't give it to
[2:38:58] him God gave dominion over the fish the
[2:39:01] sea the file of the air to man somebody
[2:39:04] help me preach he never gave it to the
[2:39:07] devil but who gave it to the devil man
[2:39:09] gave it to
[2:39:11] him man subjected himself to the
[2:39:14] Dominion of Satan and now he comes under
[2:39:18] the lordship of
[2:39:19] Satan and under his rule he stands
[2:39:24] between him and
[2:39:26] God and there he brings and makes and
[2:39:30] perverse what should be peace and joy
[2:39:33] and Holiness and
[2:39:36] happiness and causes Wars and contention
[2:39:41] and Evil
[2:39:49] man delivered it to
[2:39:51] him so what place did he
[2:39:54] take man's
[2:39:56] place
[2:39:58] where in Heavenly
[2:40:03] Places come
[2:40:06] on where did he take it what did he take
[2:40:09] he he's not there as a covering Angel
[2:40:11] he's there holding Adam's
[2:40:15] race from their rightful position of
[2:40:20] sunship by accusing them listen he has
[2:40:24] no weapon he was defeated at Calvary he
[2:40:27] has no legal right all he can do is
[2:40:31] accuse
[2:40:32] you I want you to understand that's all
[2:40:36] the power the devil has this morning is
[2:40:38] to accuse
[2:40:40] you somebody help me preach now amen but
[2:40:44] let me tell you Christ does not accuse
[2:40:47] you amen he has for given you and there
[2:40:50] is nothing that can separate you from
[2:40:53] the love of God through Christ
[2:40:57] Jesus Hallelujah are you with me your
[2:41:00] sins are gone they have been
[2:41:02] purged but Satan is there to remind you
[2:41:06] of your faults of your past of your of
[2:41:09] your of the things that you did things
[2:41:11] that you said thing and he Wars in your
[2:41:14] mind God will never fulfill his word to
[2:41:17] me the promises are not true God is not
[2:41:21] God he don't care about me he's left me
[2:41:24] out when hundreds of others he is
[2:41:26] blessed and he's left me out God has not
[2:41:29] left you out and God has not forgotten
[2:41:31] you God has a special place and a time
[2:41:35] he's going to bring Restoration in your
[2:41:37] life he's going to bring fulfillment in
[2:41:39] your life he said I know the plans that
[2:41:42] I have for you they are of good and not
[2:41:45] of evil to bring to you an expected end
[2:41:49] Hallelujah I could speak in other
[2:41:51] tongues if it'll help you but it
[2:41:53] wouldn't but oh as it races within my
[2:41:56] soul this morning I want you to know the
[2:41:59] accuser is there to
[2:42:02] accuse to talk you out of why you don't
[2:42:04] deserve your healing your deliverance
[2:42:08] your
[2:42:09] children if You' have done all this
[2:42:11] right if You' have kept them like this
[2:42:14] if you'd have done like that if you'd
[2:42:16] have made this decision if you'd have
[2:42:19] he's always there with the ifs and
[2:42:22] you're sitting there with the wi's and
[2:42:24] the how comes and all of this other
[2:42:26] things and why me Lord and why do you
[2:42:29] question
