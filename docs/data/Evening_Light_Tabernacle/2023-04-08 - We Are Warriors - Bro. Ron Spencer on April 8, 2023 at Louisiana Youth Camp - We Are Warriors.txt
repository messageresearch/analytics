chose you to be the final voice to the final age it doesn't matter how you feel it doesn't matter how you feel the word says and a prophet told you that you were the Invincible Army the final voice to the final age not another age coming and he knew what kind of a Fighters you would be the tenacity that would be inside of you that you wouldn't give up and run back when the battle got hot you would Church you would grab your rock like David put it in the slink and God armed you with the greatest weapon that he could arm you with with the word of God Hallelujah tell your neighbor just now we are warriors amen now tell them like you really mean it so if we are warriors let's make a declaration Bring It On [Applause] if you'll turn with into second Samuel chapter 22. and verse 29 wonderful services I thought this morning was awesome last night was over the top two it don't get better it's almost like a paid concert right here every night you guys are just awesome you're God's best and he saved you for the end that's why you fight like you do every one of you live in your own circle of life and God puts you there he didn't have to put a thousand people around you to cut you up you stand there and overcome on your own by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of your testimony and every one of you have a testimony and we're going to make it second Samuel chapter 22 and verse 29. for thou art my lamp oh Lord and the Lord will lighten my darkness for by Thee I have ran through I have run through a troop and by God I have leaped over a wall it's quite a good way to start isn't it as for God his way is perfect the word of the Lord is tried he is a buckler to all of them that trust in him for who is God save the Lord and who is a rock Save Our God is my strength and power and he maketh my way perfect he maketh my feet like Hinds feet setteth me upon my high places he teacheth me My Hands to War so that a bow of Steel is broken in mine arms thou has given me a she The Shield of my salvation and the gentleness hath made me great thou Hast enlarge my steps under me so that my feet did not slip I have pursued mine enemies and destroyed them and turn not again unto until I have consumed them I have consumed I have consumed them and wounded them that they could not arise yea they are Fallen under my feet for thou has girded me with strength to battle them that Rose against me hast thou subdued unto me thou has also given me the next you've heard that before the Nets of mine enemies that I might destroy them that hate me Isaiah 53 and verse 1. who hath believed our reporting to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed and we say Amen for he shall grow up before him as a tender plan not as a root out of dry ground and he hath no form or timeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief and we hid as if it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our Greeks carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken and smitten of God and Afflicted I want you to read this next verse with me but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed Heavenly Father we stand here ready for battle not only is a speaker but also his hearers now father we realize that you are the one that has gathered us together from all places of the Earth and we have come it is our moment it is our time now Lord Jesus we just ask you father that you would anoint this atmosphere May every electron in this building be anointed by the Holy Ghost we surrender ourselves as speaker and as hearer Lord we ask you to forgive us of every sin every besetting thing that would come against us and Lord we ask you now that you would anoint our hearts and knowing our minds and knowing our lips we have prepared ourself you have dealt with us in the very early mornings and turned us even to this hour we ask you now that you would anoint your children and Lord as they respond to the word it's not my word it's your words and father Lord Mayes brother Branham would pet Fritz and and he would just tell him sicking Lord may we realize that we all have a common enemy and that enemy is to come to kill and steal and destroy but we have come tonight to make a declaration he is defeated he is defeated at Calvary the war has taken place and our champion arose on Easter morning and we have an empty tomb today he conquered death Helen the grave and took the Keys of the Kingdom away from Satan now father we ask you to touch your children tonight and every need that would come we ask you to touch them in the name of Jesus Christ and this congregation says amen you may be seated I'd like to speak to you this afternoon on we are warriors I'd like to make it personal to you invite you to repeat it with me I am a lawyer ah I am a warrior I want you to say it until you believe it ah I am a warrior now anybody can fight here and stand here in this audience with all of these around you and say and say the Declaration but what about when you're home what about when you're standing by yourself what about when the enemy's breathe in his hot breath down your neck and it's you and Jesus now with that in mind I am a warrior the scripture says in Isaiah 54 and verse 17 no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn so your Tormentor is going to be judged by your testimony this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me saith the Lord Philippians chapter 1 and verse 6 be in confidence of this confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ God is not in the business of getting halfway with you many of your friends May quit on you there may be an urge to where you say I give up I can't stand the battle but just then God comes on the scene for you cause he'll never leave you he'll never forsake you he'll be with you to the end that's his word that's his promise with that in mind we can quote Philippians chapter 4 and verse 13. I can do all things put it with me I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might you say brother Ron but I don't feel strong brother random said when the weakest of Christians go on their knees when the weakest of Christians go on their knees they cause hell to tremble put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore taken to you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and haven't done all to stand stand therefore with your loins gird about with truth with the breastplate of the righteousness and your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taken the shield of faith who's going to do this you are who's going to do this you are taking the shield of Faith wherewith you may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of of Salvation and this sword of the spirit which is the word of God praying always pray in all ways prayer is more powerful than an atomic bomb and because you are who you are a son and daughter of God has more Authority than an archangel in heaven because who you are and it's your communication with God you're not going through a father you're not going through a priest you're not going through your favor preacher it's you and God [Applause] Mark chapter 16. and verse 15. Jesus is in his final words and he saith unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned now notice these next words and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name in my name what a powerful song a few moments ago in my name shall they cast out devils and they shall speak with new tongues and they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover this is God's word this is God's promise I I like this I like this this the this this quotation we will fight on the beaches we shall fight on the land and the grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the Hills we shall Never Surrender we will fight for our families we will fight for our children we will fight for our healing we will fight for deliverance we will fight for joy we will fight for peace we will fight for the Holy Ghost we will fight until our bodies are changed and we're sitting at the marriage supper of the Lamb I want to tell the devil we're not surrendering I wanted to hear it from our lips we refuse to surrender we refuse to give up we refuse to run back we are not cowards [Applause] now Satan knows that you're here he knows that you are something that he has to contend with he's got the world but he has to fight you and he don't have long to work but you have been armed just because he attacks don't mean you have to surrender to him Satan knows that that there is nothing that he can do to stop our Lord think about that he knows that the resurrection's coming and he can't stop it he knows there's a bride on the scene and he can't stop it he knows there's a Rapture get ready to happen he can't stop it and if we could just put it real personal he can't stop you he can only try to distract you but he can't stop you but brother Ron I've been in some real battles well let me just mention a few to you we talk about Sarah but Sarah endured 90 years of frustrating humiliation of being barren none of us have ever had a day like job had but he had a revelation he had a revelation no matter what his friends turned against him his wife turned against him his flesh was laid up with balls he was bankrupt on every hand but he said though God slay me yet I'm going to trust him Isaac staggered in the Darkness in the blindness and it was because God had a plan because as a natural man he would have picked Esau but God picked Jacob there was a widow when her son was starving to death but if she could only get past the trial and take the prophet at his word she would have a barrel that would be Unlimited she would have a cruise of all that would be Unlimited if you can get past your trunk if you can get past your truck are you with me now sometimes your greatest trial only tells you that's your greatest Victory is laying right in front of you [Applause] Shadrach Meshach could have been to go their their names roll off of their lips so quickly but they refuse to bend and bow they were thrown into a fiery furnace but it was there it was in the midst of their hardest trial that is where God met them let me just say if you look hard enough in the midst of your hardest trial I know what I'm talking about now and I miss you your hardest trial that's where God will meet you Bartimaeus was blind but he screamed thou son of David have mercy upon me it was physically impossible for Jesus to hurt him hurt him but his faith spread out he went home healed nobody would have to lead him to the wall ever again tonight can be the difference in your life you was blind you were sick you was without the Holy Ghost you was lost without God but that night in Louisiana changed my life I'll never be the same ever again Lazarus died and it seemed like that God was had carried way too long but let me just say this to you Jesus is always on time won't you say it with me Jesus is always on time he had to get sick he had to come to a point to where that even his critics said worse Jesus when you really need him the doubters were in his ears at the last moment Jesus knows how to shut doubters up and he asked the sisters roll away the stone Jesus could have blowed the stone away he could have spoke the stone away but sometimes he asked you to have faith in what he's getting ready to do he's asking you to have faith in what he's saying will you step forth while everybody's laughing while every critic is making fun of you will you will you take a hole to the stone with your hands you may not have the strength to push it over just put your hands on the rock Gotta Give You Supernatural power to push the stone out of it because there's a dead man that's not going to be dead much longer and Lazarus was in another realm fellowshipping with the Patriots of old but he heard a voice that he was very familiar with and that voice called him by name God knows how to call you by name [Applause] he came walking out of that tomb Jesus instructed to sisters take off these great clothes he's not going to need them no more I don't know what you can't clothe with today maybe it's depression maybe it's a lot of different things you're not gonna need that no more [Applause] on the roughest of days the lowest hours of our despair sister Erica if you're listening this is for you even in those times we're still chosen we're still blessed we're still favored we're still forgiven we're still loved we're still that of God we're still Victorious we're in heck we're inheritors of All That Heaven has we're privileged to walk with our own Creator we're married to the King of Kings he calls us his beloved we're strong in faith armed to fight Devils entrusted with God's word the most powerful weapon we're protected by the arm of the almighty he places his hedge around us we have an assurance that every time that we call he hears he answers every time that we come he hears he answers because he is our God this is yours this is your word here another man says why does God let troubles come God harnesses troubles puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him these troubles bring us closer fellowship with God I asked God why are you taking me through such Troubled Water and he replied because you're intimate don't know how to swim [Applause] I can see him as the heavens and the Earth turn black rocks belched out of the mountains the whole heavens and the Earth moon the stars refused to sign he conquered it and when he went down and descended down and knocked at the door where the lost souls was I mean the doors came open those people who laughed and made fun of Enoch who made fun of Noah I can hear him say I am that one that Enoch said would come with ten thousand of his Saints why didn't you believe Enoch why didn't you believe Noah everything had to know that he'd conquered when he shut the door on them the days of mercies was passed on down into the lowest pits of hell he went and he knocked at the city doors of the devil's hell and all that Devil comes to the door and as he come to look to see there he was he said well here you are after all I sure thought I had you when I killed the prophets I thought I had you when I cut John's head off in prison but now you're here and I can hear him say as he straightened himself up Satan I'm the Virgin born son of the Living God my blood's still wet on the cross I paid the price I conquered I've come down to take over strip you of everything that you claimed that you had reach over on his side and jerk the keys of death Hell In The Grave off of him and kick him back into a place where he belongs he conquered hell when he arose he's had the keys of death and Hell hanging on his side so what is the church scared about them why do we got to be afraid of why don't we sit quietly this is our word this word declares Us Victorious this word declares us overcome us we can't lose [Applause] David would say in Psalms 27 and verse 1 the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I feel Whom Shall I Fear I'm not fearing cancer and it's supposed to be the biggest baddest demon that Satan's got to offer why should I fear why should I fear people get scared when they get a little bitty cancer on their foot and here a preacher standing in front of you this ain't entertainment folks I'm not here to entertain you I'm here to tell you you can be either for cancer but God's still your Victor you can eat up a sin God's here to take care of that he's got the prescription he's got the Cure [Applause] [Applause] the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host shouldn't Camp against me my heart shall not fail the war should rise against me and this will I be confident one thing that I have desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord into inquiring this Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up on a rock now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing yeah I will sing praises unto the Lord then how come does our enemy want us to set like church mice we can go to a ball game and scream our heads off have banners raving every witch away in the world you know sooner or later your team's gonna lose [Applause] the devil don't get mad at you out there he don't get mad at you screaming until your horse but you just start shouting in church you just start Amen in the word of God you just start worshiping and you'll get the devil nervous you'll get him for all the patience [Applause] worship is a sign of victory [Applause] the devil will point to your neighbor he'll point to this one in that one well they're getting a little bit fanatical why don't you just stop with the criticism and start praising with some praise it's your turn it's your seat if I could go to the celebrities in hell Elvis Presley would love to sit in this service the basketball stars have passed would love to come set in this service the football stars have passed would love to be in this service just one and then in that five minutes they'd like to get right with God so they wouldn't be condemned to a devil's hell they may have made millions in this life but in hell it don't make no difference you can be the greatest celebrity in Hollywood but when you die Marilyn Monroe would love to have this seat so don't you be ashamed of your sin [Applause] let me sing that you're safe [Applause] I understand it only took about 29 minutes for you to fill this place up you waited with great anticipation when the when the clock would start you punched your ticket and a whole lot of people didn't get to punch this they're watching so take advantage of sitting in that pew catch a few right now this is my pew I'm Ready for War [Applause] [Applause] brother
