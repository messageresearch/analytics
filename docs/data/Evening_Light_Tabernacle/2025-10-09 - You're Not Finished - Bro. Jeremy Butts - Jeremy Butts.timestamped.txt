[0:23] When I feel like I can't make it.
[0:28] When my world's falling apart.
[0:32] When I feel forgotten
[0:35] alone with a broken heart.
[0:40] When I question every promise
[0:44] and doubted every prayer.
[0:49] It's in the silence.
[0:51] Somehow I know you're there.
[0:58] I almost let go.
[1:02] Then you told me the truth that you're
[1:05] not finished
[1:09] and you're not done.
[1:13] You made me a promise
[1:16] that I would overcome.
[1:18] [Applause]
[1:21] You speak to my valley.
[1:25] the answer to you
[1:29] and every mountain in my way to set you.

[2:04] you reveal your hand.

[2:30] I remember your truth that you're not
[2:34] finished,
[2:37] that you're not done.
[2:41] You made me a promise
[2:43] that I will overcome.
[2:48] You speak to my valley.
[2:52] I answer to you.
[2:56] And every mountain in my way said you
[3:04] cuz you're not finished
[3:12] and you're not finished.
[3:20] You with me in the shadow
[3:23] through heavy win my battle
[3:28] and you never turn away and never stop
[3:32] calling my name.
[3:36] Breathe on what's been broken.
[3:39] restor.
[3:43] You speak to my storm and your voice to
[3:47] come the crashing waves.
[3:52] Cuz you're not finished
[3:56] and you're not done.
[4:00] You made me a promise
[4:02] that I would overcome.
