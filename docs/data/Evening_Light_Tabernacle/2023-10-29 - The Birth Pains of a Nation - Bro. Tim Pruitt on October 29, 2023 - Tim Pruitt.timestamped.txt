[23:48] God blessed them and and uh you know

[24:00] to God and you know that starts with
[24:02] with a a devoted family and devoted
[24:06] parents and grandparents and great
[24:08] grandparents and a church you know that
[24:11] is devoted to God that we can nurture
[24:15] and raise these these little ones in the
[24:17] admonition of the Lord this is so
[24:19] important and you're very important in
[24:22] the rearing of this child too you that

[25:01] um a day like when Moses was born and
[25:05] and his parents um had him brought him
[25:08] forth in a very Troublesome time but
[25:11] there they learned in that TR trouble
[25:13] some time to trust God and in a moment
[25:17] of of horrible circumstances where they
[25:20] were killing the the the male children
[25:23] they entrusted him into the Nile
[25:26] obedient to God and God brought him
[25:31] through and we believe that in this hour
[25:33] that we're living in that God will bring
[25:36] us through so let's just go to the Lord
[25:38] in prayer as we uh dedicate this little
[25:41] ones to the Lord dear Jesus you said
[25:45] yourself to allow little ones to come to
[25:48] you for such is the kingdom of heaven

[25:57] these parents Lord and they're wanting
[26:00] to say God you've entrusted us with such
[26:03] a precious gift but we realize we can't

[26:15] strength and her courage along life's
[26:18] journey the

[26:35] will be with one with soft hands and and
[26:38] a caring guide to guide this child a
[26:41] long life's journey I ask Lord that the
[26:44] Holy Spirit would just be with this
[26:47] family and preeminent Lord within their
[26:51] in their home may he be the predominant
[26:54] one the leader in the home that they

[46:16] time uh we we just a time today of
[46:21] reflection of thinking of of praying of
[46:24] believing together um as you know I went
[46:27] to um Johnson City Tennessee uh we had
[46:32] our sister Erica Reagan Parker she was
[46:37] 44 years old that passed away brother
[46:39] Donnie's daughter you know we prayed and
[46:42] God has given us the answer and he gave
[46:45] us the answer by rescuing her from the
[46:47] dreaded disease of cancer that ravaged
[46:51] her body and uh we want to thank the
[46:53] Lord for her life and testimony I I went
[46:56] there and I um ministered to the family
[47:00] and to the church and um you know was
[47:03] just a partner with them and uh as you
[47:07] know brother Donnie Reagan and I have
[47:09] been very close bosom friends since
[47:13] 1987 and uh even though I was scheduled
[47:16] to go away to um flight to Switzerland
[47:19] and then on to France for meetings um
[47:23] you know I I just couldn't go with under
[47:25] the circum ances and so I I stayed home
[47:29] and brother Timothy went had tremendous
[47:31] meetings he's finished up in Belgium
[47:34] today and he'll be traveling home uh on
[47:37] Tuesday so keep him in your prayers that
[47:39] the Lord would be with them and he is
[47:41] certainly blessed them in both places
[47:44] there in France with tremendous meetings
[47:46] and an outpouring of the spirit and
[47:48] Revival coming there and and uh so we
[47:52] are thankful to the Lord I also wanted
[47:55] to mention to you as the church that our
[47:58] brother Billy Paul brandham he was 88
[48:01] years old he passed away on October the
[48:03] 19th with pancreatic cancer and um I I
[48:08] guess they kind of kept that a little
[48:10] bit secret most people didn't know that
[48:13] um he was uh in that condition but
[48:16] brother Billy was a a loving man and so
[48:19] sweet and very kind you just couldn't
[48:21] help but love him and certainly I had a
[48:23] special place in my heart for uh you
[48:26] know many many years ago when my wife
[48:28] was just a young teenager about 13 she
[48:31] had um uh an awful condition that
[48:36] doctors uh had said that she was uh
[48:38] going to uh well they they thought it
[48:42] was menitis they were uncertain what it
[48:45] was but they checked her out of the
[48:48] hospital and um took her to over to col
[48:52] Lake Mississippi where brother Billy
[48:54] Paul brother um some of the other
[48:57] brothers brother Doug McHugh was there
[48:59] and in a prayer line she was healed for
[49:02] the glory of God and lived many years
[49:05] and blessed us as a wife a mother a
[49:08] grandmother a you know a church pastor's
[49:11] wife you know it just um wonderful
[49:14] wonderful things that the Lord did and I
[49:17] know God used brother Billy in many ways
[49:20] as um you know through life's journey
[49:23] and I want to thank the Lord for him and
[49:26] his love for the Lord and his love for
[49:28] the message and his love for the the
[49:31] things of god so let's stand together as
[49:34] we we go to prayer this morning we just
[49:36] remember these families in prayer as
[49:39] they continue to deal with their loss uh
[49:43] pray for the Reagan family and the the
[49:46] brandham family as well and the extended
[49:49] family we just want to ask God's grace
[49:52] now upon
[49:54] them
[50:00] Lord as we just bow before you
[50:03] today we want to thank you for lives
[50:06] that have gone before us lives that has
[50:09] inspired us we think about sister Erica
[50:13] and her life and
[50:15] testimony how that she was one who died
[50:18] in faith believing the promise of God
[50:21] and as I testified of her in the service
[50:26] that she was a woman of faith and we
[50:29] thank you Lord for these these people of
[50:32] Faith like her like brother Billy Paul
[50:35] who has who has tried to stand for you
[50:38] with all that he knew we believe that he
[50:41] was a sincere Christian and we know Lord
[50:45] that he has been gathered with his
[50:47] people on the other side we're asking
[50:50] Lord today for those of us in the
[50:53] journey that you will just encourage

[51:05] fight the battle and Lord there are
[51:08] those members of the Bride Lord that
[51:12] have been called on to the other side

[51:17] more over there than there is here as
[51:21] the bride is made up of Seven Ages and
[51:25] here we think of Father here we're the
[51:28] last runners in the race and the

[53:21] hearts in Jesus name amen amen God bless
[53:26] you let's turn to the Bible let's go to
[53:29] Joshua 111 is a scripture that I ended
[53:32] on the other day and I thought I would I
[53:36] would read from here again this morning
[53:39] I've got uh lots of places to go in in
[53:43] the word of God today so I pray that
[53:45] you'll you'll be patient with me some
[53:49] things I want to speak to you about
[53:51] personally um as far as the times that
[53:55] were're in so I'm going to read from
[53:58] this and from Isaiah 66 also so Joshua
[54:03] 111 pass through the host command the
[54:06] people saying prepare you victuals for
[54:08] within three days you shall pass over
[54:10] this Jordan to go in to possess the land
[54:14] which the Lord your God hath given you
[54:16] to possess it and Isaiah 66 and verse
[54:21] 8 who hath heard such a thing who has
[54:25] seen such things shall the Earth be made
[54:30] to bring forth in one day or shall a
[54:33] nation be born at once for as soon as
[54:36] Zion travailed she brought forth her
[54:39] children shall I bring to the birth and
[54:43] not cause to bring forth sayeth the Lord
[54:46] shall I cause to bring forth and shut
[54:48] the womb saith my thy God Rejoice ye
[54:53] with Jerusalem and be glad with her all
[54:56] ye that love her Rejoice for Joy with
[54:59] her all ye that mourn for her may God
[55:03] bless you as you are seated may add His
[55:06] blessings to the word amen may he just
[55:11] today take us over in such a way that we
[55:14] Minister the words of
[55:17] life looking over this congregation
[55:20] today we want to just focus in on some
[55:23] things today as we are living in this
[55:27] time this day and hour I you know am
[55:30] have been a very much of a student of
[55:33] the visions of brother brandom and I've
[55:35] mentioned this to many of you before but
[55:38] I'm just going to go over with you as uh
[55:41] time has passed and we are here now at a
[55:43] very special moment in time I I feel
[55:47] like that we are but um many years ago
[55:50] now in
[55:53] 1937 brother brandham had a a vision
[55:55] that took place shortly after his wife
[55:59] wife hope and his baby daughter Sharon
[56:01] Rose's death and he um he of course was
[56:06] uh in a very despondent condition he had
[56:09] tried on this would now be two occasions
[56:12] on which he would try to take his life
[56:14] because he didn't feel like it was worth
[56:17] living he looked at himself as a failure
[56:20] having disobeyed the Lord and having
[56:23] things that had come upon him as you
[56:25] know he was to uh have went with the
[56:28] Pentecostal people after his experience
[56:31] at Mishawaka and then his his
[56:34] mother-in-law Hop's mother would um just
[56:37] just come out and and uh adamantly
[56:40] refused to let her daughter go out on
[56:43] the field as he would go out to preach
[56:46] to the Pentecostal people and so because
[56:49] he didn't go he would try many times to
[56:52] make up for that in life but in this he
[56:55] was very despondent because he looked at
[56:59] his situation and uh you know as um
[57:04] having lost a wife and a little baby
[57:06] daughter somewhere around 8 months old
[57:08] and and um you know he he tried to take
[57:13] his life by first um taking a hold of
[57:17] the the power lines and and
[57:19] electrocuting himself and found himself
[57:22] at the bottom there just weep and and
[57:25] beside himself at the bottom of the pole
[57:28] and later he would try to take his life
[57:30] a second time with um with with a pistol
[57:33] he was used his service revolver and uh
[57:37] he tried to take his life he got down
[57:40] and prayed and said you know Our Father
[57:43] which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name
[57:45] thy kingdom come thy will be done and
[57:47] pulled the hammer back and it wouldn't
[57:49] fire so he threw it across the room and
[57:53] it went off and and uh you know it was
[57:56] God protecting the
[57:58] gift and and so as as you know in this
[58:02] despondent condition he laid across the
[58:05] bed
[58:06] and you know Place some place he said he
[58:09] went to sleep or he must have went to
[58:11] sleep or another it was a trance or he
[58:14] called it a
[58:15] vision but nevertheless he's he thought
[58:19] he was um walking along a path out West
[58:25] and he was dressed in western clothes
[58:28] and as he was out on this Prairie he um
[58:33] happened to look along the path was a
[58:36] wagon an old covered wagon that was
[58:39] there and the wheel was noticeably
[58:42] broken with the axle hanging down and as
[58:45] he approached the scene he was whistling
[58:48] and or perhaps singing a tune to an old
[58:52] country a cowboy ball
[58:55] of the wheel of the wagon is broken this
[58:58] song although it was written I think
[59:01] some uh 10 years before was sang by paty
[59:04] Montana with the Prairie Ramblers in
[59:07] 1936 and was sang on a on the radio on a
[59:11] popular show called Grand old Opry and
[59:14] it was a mournful account of a a bidding
[59:18] farewell to ranch life it was really the
[59:22] sad song of a cowboy
[59:25] and the end of life and this and it goes
[59:28] along like this the wheel of the wagon
[59:30] is broken it ain't going to turn no more
[59:34] my days on the Prairie are over there is
[59:37] weeds around the Old Ranch door there
[59:41] ain't any campfires smoking where we
[59:44] sang when the day was through the wheel
[59:47] of the wagon is broken and gone is the
[59:51] West I knew goodbye Old Faithful there's
[59:54] a sign on the ranch for sale Goodbye Oh
[59:59] faithful looks like the end of the trail
[1:00:03] and so as he's whistling this song about
[1:00:07] death then somewhere near the the broken
[1:00:10] down wagon he sees this beautiful young
[1:00:13] girl she's about 18 or 20 years of age
[1:00:18] and and uh I I just want to break here
[1:00:22] in the story just to remind you as he
[1:00:26] looked at this um this Prairie Schooner
[1:00:31] and the Wagon Wheel that was broken he
[1:00:33] would mention of it you know it
[1:00:35] represented his broken
[1:00:37] family but um when he had his Visions to
[1:00:41] go west and some of you that are here
[1:00:44] might remember many years ago now in the
[1:00:47] old church I took a whole series on the
[1:00:50] Visions to go west as we studied those
[1:00:52] visions of why God sent brother brandham
[1:00:55] West and so on like that and this was
[1:00:58] one of them that he he thought you know
[1:01:02] that um he in the cuses of time he tells
[1:01:06] about it he said I I turned around and
[1:01:10] to my right sitting at the front of the
[1:01:12] gate was an old Prairie scooner you know
[1:01:15] what a covered wagon with horses hitched
[1:01:17] to it and sitting opposite the driver's
[1:01:20] side was my wife and I looked in the
[1:01:22] back my children was sitting back in
[1:01:25] there and I climbed up on the wagon I
[1:01:27] said honey I've stood all I can stand
[1:01:31] and I picked up the lines and pulled the
[1:01:33] lead horse and started heading Westward
[1:01:36] and the voice spoke to me when this
[1:01:38] comes to pass then go Westward and then
[1:01:42] he continues telling and picks it up
[1:01:44] later in the same sermon is this the
[1:01:46] sign of the end sir that Vision had my
[1:01:49] wife and my children and that the very
[1:01:51] thing was I was in a covered wagon and
[1:01:53] the minute I walked in there there was I
[1:01:56] was in my station wagon and that's the
[1:01:59] way we leave in a couple days not
[1:02:00] knowing where we're going not knowing
[1:02:02] what we're going to do when we get there
[1:02:04] just going so you can you can see the
[1:02:07] the parallel just past the the
[1:02:11] modern-day Prairie Schooner his old
[1:02:13] station wagon just pass the wreckage
[1:02:17] here he enters into that other
[1:02:20] dimension so you know you know sometimes
[1:02:23] Visions are very Timeless in that even
[1:02:26] though here he is in
[1:02:28] 1930 um 6 1937 and there you know here
[1:02:33] he is in that time but actually he's
[1:02:35] been transported right to the wreckage
[1:02:40] right past the wreckage of the station
[1:02:42] wagon somewhere out on the Prairie out
[1:02:45] west and we know that he died there in
[1:02:48] amarilla Texas there out in the prairie
[1:02:51] walking along the roads and he's singing
[1:02:54] this popular Western ballad the wheels
[1:02:56] of the wagon is broken and as he passes
[1:02:59] the covered
[1:03:00] wagon um or this Prairie Schooner and he
[1:03:04] he noticed that the the the W wheel is
[1:03:08] broken and they making the box frame
[1:03:11] tipped down in one corner until the axle
[1:03:13] touched the ground and and just past
[1:03:17] that wreckage here was this pretty young
[1:03:21] lady that stood watching him and the
[1:03:25] wind would play in her in her long
[1:03:27] blonde hair and her her eyes just
[1:03:30] sparkled blue and in the Sun and as he
[1:03:33] walked by he just kind of tipped his hat
[1:03:36] and greeted her cheerfully and said um
[1:03:39] good morning ma'am she said good morning
[1:03:42] Daddy well he stopped and he stared at
[1:03:45] this beautiful young woman and said well
[1:03:48] miss how can I be your daddy when you're
[1:03:51] almost as old as I am and her you know
[1:03:55] she just smiled at him and showing her
[1:03:57] perfectly formed teeth and said daddy
[1:04:00] you just don't know where you're at on
[1:04:02] Earth I was your little Sharon Rose
[1:04:06] Sharon but but you were a little baby
[1:04:09] and there aren't any babies here Daddy
[1:04:12] though she she replied we're all the
[1:04:14] same age we're Immortal I said honey

[1:04:19] Mother's up there waiting for you
[1:04:20] where's Billy Paul my brother and he
[1:04:23] said I he'll be coming soon and Sharon
[1:04:26] said I'm going to wait here for Billy
[1:04:28] Paul why don't you go on and see mother
[1:04:31] she's waiting for you up at your new
[1:04:35] home and as brother brandham and I'm
[1:04:38] just repeating some of the things that
[1:04:40] he said he said honey I I don't
[1:04:43] understand he said well Daddy you just
[1:04:45] don't know where you're at so well am I
[1:04:48] not on the Prairie and he said no you
[1:04:50] turned your right and looked and he said
[1:04:53] he looked and he saw saw the most
[1:04:54] beautiful light that was coming out of
[1:04:57] the most beautiful place she'd ever seen
[1:04:59] and said this is heaven
[1:05:02] Daddy and mother's up there waiting for
[1:05:05] you and I said home said at at in your
[1:05:09] home said you mean I got a home honey
[1:05:12] there was never a Bram ever rich and
[1:05:14] Never Had A Home of Their Own well at
[1:05:16] that present time he he rented a place
[1:05:19] that was a what was called a shotgun
[1:05:21] house and um called so because it was
[1:05:25] basically two rooms if you shot a gun it
[1:05:27] was shot shoot all the way through the
[1:05:29] house through every room in the house
[1:05:31] and it had no toilet it had no running
[1:05:34] water it was uh it was just there the
[1:05:38] minimum electricity no doubt either coal
[1:05:41] at all or or um the uh coal itself that
[1:05:46] would be burned in an old heater and
[1:05:50] perhaps a wood heater but anyway here
[1:05:53] he'd never had a home before and she
[1:05:55] pointed up the road and there at the end
[1:05:57] of the trail was this beautiful mansion
[1:06:00] that was perched on the top of a hill
[1:06:03] and it seemed as though the the sunbeams
[1:06:07] just was just all around the Mansions
[1:06:10] roof and shot out in every direction
[1:06:13] guiding weary Travelers home to rest and
[1:06:18] so he would walk from there up toward
[1:06:21] there to uh and he would sing my home
[1:06:25] sweet home and a long stairwell led up
[1:06:28] to from the bottom of the hill to the
[1:06:30] front door and and hope waited there in
[1:06:33] an Open Door dressed in white with their
[1:06:36] long black hair unfurled to the breeze
[1:06:38] and brother brand bounded up the
[1:06:41] stairway taking probably three step
[1:06:44] steps at as stride and when he reached
[1:06:46] the land and he he fell at her or knelt
[1:06:49] at her feet and holding her hand and she
[1:06:51] urged him to give up to get up and said
[1:06:54] he said oh hope honey I can't stand it
[1:06:58] no longer I'm just about to go wild
[1:07:01] since you left and she said I've seen
[1:07:04] all that's went on Bill promise me
[1:07:08] something I I want to stop there just
[1:07:10] for a moment I've seen all that's went
[1:07:13] on a lot of times you know we think of
[1:07:17] that other dimension being in a far away
[1:07:21] place but brother Brenham said it was a
[1:07:24] slanted place he said I went into a
[1:07:26] slanted place about 12 feet above my
[1:07:30] head and he said I could look back and I
[1:07:33] could see my body so of standing there
[1:07:36] he could see both
[1:07:38] Realms and and I as I Rejoice today
[1:07:42] hearing of Joel van BR in there from
[1:07:46] Switzerland he came to the meetings in
[1:07:48] Belgium and he's one of brother Joshua
[1:07:51] and brother Isaiah V bren's brother
[1:07:54] and he's been away from the Lord but
[1:07:56] today he came back to the Lord and
[1:07:59] surrendered his life to Christ there in
[1:08:01] the meetings this morning and I couldn't
[1:08:04] help but thinking of the scriptures
[1:08:06] where he says there is rejoicing in the
[1:08:09] presence of angels when one sinner
[1:08:14] repents it didn't say that Angels
[1:08:16] Rejoice they don't really know what it
[1:08:19] is to be lost but it said in the
[1:08:22] presence of angels there is rejoicing
[1:08:26] the Saints there Rejoice if you would
[1:08:28] read in the under the fif seal you would
[1:08:30] see that those Souls of the altar knew
[1:08:34] even what had happened to them and that
[1:08:36] they had been martyred they knew also
[1:08:38] the conditions on the earth and that
[1:08:40] others were being martyred and and they
[1:08:43] they conferred their in their prayer to
[1:08:46] God when they when they asked for how
[1:08:49] long how long will you will you will
[1:08:52] this go on and he told them to rest a
[1:08:54] little while and give them white robes
[1:08:55] and of course we know those were Jewish
[1:08:58] believers who who died for the testimony
[1:09:01] that they held but I want to just get to
[1:09:03] back to you said I've seen all that's
[1:09:05] went on Bill and you know and so he said
[1:09:10] promise me something who she said
[1:09:12] promise me something what promise me you
[1:09:14] won't worry no more and he said you know
[1:09:18] I've seen Sherry honey didn't our girl
[1:09:20] make a beautiful woman said yes she's
[1:09:23] waiting for Billy isn't she and said
[1:09:26] promise me won't you that you won't
[1:09:29] worry sharing off and I are much better
[1:09:32] off than you are just promise me you
[1:09:35] won't worry you've got to stop worrying
[1:09:37] about me so well I can't help it I've
[1:09:39] been so lonesome for you both and Billy
[1:09:42] Paul cries for me for you all the time
[1:09:44] and I don't know what to do with them
[1:09:46] well Sharon and our far better off than
[1:09:49] you are promise me you won't worry about
[1:09:52] us anymore and Hope put an arm around
[1:09:54] his shoulder and patted his back as
[1:09:56] she'd done so often on Earth and and she
[1:09:59] she said come on in you're tired aren't
[1:10:01] you said you're so tired you've been
[1:10:04] praying for the sick and these are
[1:10:06] brother brandom's words and I hadn't
[1:10:07] prayed for the sick in them days and
[1:10:10] that was the reason I know someday I I I
[1:10:12] pass out here in the Pulpit friends the
[1:10:15] other night when I was with you here I
[1:10:17] passed completely out among you I passed
[1:10:18] out as for as many as 24 hours at a time
[1:10:21] I no one of these nights I'm going you
[1:10:23] know he's trying to rationalize all of
[1:10:26] this you know understand what is
[1:10:28] happening and he said she said bill you
[1:10:31] look so tired you're wearing yourself
[1:10:33] out praying for this sick said I know
[1:10:36] all about it bill again I want you to
[1:10:38] get it I know all about it Bill come
[1:10:41] inside with me and now you can sit down
[1:10:43] and rest and he walked with her inside
[1:10:47] the the mansion and sat down on a green
[1:10:50] Morris chair exactly like the one he'd
[1:10:52] lost to finance company because he
[1:10:54] couldn't make the payments and hope said
[1:10:57] you remember that chair a lump formed in
[1:10:59] his throat and said yeah how well I
[1:11:01] remember said well they won't take this
[1:11:04] one it's paid
[1:11:06] for I want to stop just for a minute
[1:11:09] Heaven is a real
[1:11:12] place there are real people there in
[1:11:16] real
[1:11:17] bodies and there are things in heaven
[1:11:20] that look much like what is here on the
[1:11:23] Earth
[1:11:25] there are
[1:11:27] Fields with great panoramic views there
[1:11:30] are Hills there are valleys there are
[1:11:33] mountains there are
[1:11:35] rivers there are parks with
[1:11:39] trees I'm giving this to you from the
[1:11:42] Bible there's all kinds of things that
[1:11:46] remind us of this world here in this
[1:11:50] Shadow
[1:11:51] land and things that we we that Comfort
[1:11:54] us here like this Morris chair that he
[1:11:57] talks
[1:11:58] about they they're there too and he says
[1:12:03] I'm going home where I got a chair to
[1:12:05] sit down to rest a little
[1:12:08] while come over there and I I wish I
[1:12:11] could meet with every one of you over
[1:12:12] there I believe there's a land Beyond
[1:12:14] this here Beyond this veil of tears and
[1:12:17] sorrows and heartaches I preached day
[1:12:20] and night I've stayed till I shut sh
[1:12:24] crying I've standed the platform until
[1:12:27] they have to pack me out why because
[1:12:30] I've tried to make up for the time that
[1:12:32] I lost back
[1:12:34] there and so all of a sudden he feels
[1:12:37] himself going back and he said you're
[1:12:38] going back Bill promise me you won't
[1:12:41] worry and he said just then I come into
[1:12:43] the room and it was dark and I could
[1:12:45] feel her arm around me patting me and I
[1:12:47] heard her voice I thought oh it can't be
[1:12:49] it can't be the vision's over and I I
[1:12:52] stood I shook my head I looked and her
[1:12:54] arm was still around me and she was
[1:12:56] patting me and said Billy promise me you
[1:12:58] won't worry no more I promise hope and
[1:13:01] she took her arm away and that was all
[1:13:04] of it I've never worried since I tell
[1:13:08] you brother a real anchored faith in God
[1:13:11] can stand take it stand upon the beaten
[1:13:14] rock of the rock of Eternity and stand
[1:13:16] there and look off into the heavens when
[1:13:18] the waves and things are beaten against
[1:13:20] its bowels and look to him and say I am
[1:13:24] the resurrection and life he that
[1:13:26] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[1:13:28] shall he live and whosoever liveth and
[1:13:29] believeth in me shall never die brother
[1:13:32] it takes something here in the
[1:13:34] heart now as I as I look at this for a
[1:13:38] moment and of course for many of you
[1:13:41] I've went over this before and maybe
[1:13:45] have done it even in the Pulpit but now
[1:13:47] that we are past the event let me just
[1:13:50] bring it out again my observation
[1:13:54] of the vision that uh that in 1965 when
[1:13:58] brother bradam left this Mortal life and
[1:14:01] just past the wreckage of his station
[1:14:04] wagon the modern day covered wagon
[1:14:06] waited Sharon Rose to greet him yes sir
[1:14:10] and this dream or Vision that he was
[1:14:12] visiting there is a mortal but Sharon
[1:14:15] Rose was in a theophonic form and she
[1:14:18] was no longer an infant but a grown
[1:14:22] woman and and those in theophonic
[1:14:25] form understand things that Mortals do
[1:14:28] not she recognized him he did not
[1:14:31] recognize her she told him there aren't
[1:14:35] any babies here Daddy we're all the same
[1:14:38] age we're
[1:14:39] Immortal and so you know she told him
[1:14:42] said you remember how you taught
[1:14:43] immortality which he hadn't taught
[1:14:46] immortality that way at that time this
[1:14:48] is very very early in his ministry and
[1:14:51] so and then she she also was waiting
[1:14:55] patiently for her brother Billy Paul to
[1:14:59] come she knew that he would be coming
[1:15:03] and she was waiting at that Gateway
[1:15:06] between
[1:15:08] Dimensions now here's the facts if we
[1:15:12] are alive in physical form in our
[1:15:14] Corporal bodies when the Lord comes
[1:15:17] those in the ovic form will appear to us
[1:15:21] and we will Unite and
[1:15:24] resurrect uh are they will appear to us
[1:15:27] and will unite and resurrect and glorify
[1:15:30] their body if we die we go to join those
[1:15:34] that are in theophonic form and Sharon
[1:15:38] Rose new Billy would come to her she was
[1:15:41] waiting for his
[1:15:42] arrival now the vision showed us then
[1:15:46] that brother Billy would go by the way
[1:15:48] of the Grave that the Saints there were
[1:15:51] expecting his arrival
[1:15:54] now so you see with them expecting him
[1:15:57] they knew he was coming and I I just
[1:16:00] want to
[1:16:01] say even this moment that we're in as we
[1:16:05] are now past that time where brother
[1:16:07] Billy now has went there and he's had
[1:16:10] this Reunion where Sharon Rose has met
[1:16:13] him and he's had reunion with the rest
[1:16:15] of the
[1:16:16] family I I I just want to say God knew
[1:16:20] we would be here that's right even as
[1:16:23] this time and so we know the vision is
[1:16:28] transpiring right around us right now
[1:16:31] where where uh so we're we're not we
[1:16:35] we're not be beyond what God had planned
[1:16:39] we're not in some kind of overtime or
[1:16:43] Pastime or we're
[1:16:45] exactly where we're supposed to be in
[1:16:48] the
[1:16:49] vision and so you know here we we know
[1:16:53] now brother Billy has met with um sister
[1:16:57] Sharon Rose I I want to just share with
[1:17:00] you the quotes from who is this MDC
[1:17:02] which I draw my understanding from that
[1:17:06] when a man is Born Again from Heaven he
[1:17:10] becomes a spirit babe in Christ and then
[1:17:13] when this robe of flesh is dropped
[1:17:15] there's a natural body theophany a body
[1:17:19] not made with hand neither born of a
[1:17:22] woman
[1:17:23] that we go to and then that body returns
[1:17:27] back and picks up the glorified
[1:17:30] body and then he goes on to say second
[1:17:33] Thessalonians tells us that we will meet
[1:17:36] him in the air a beautiful type of
[1:17:38] Rebecca meeting Isaac in the field in
[1:17:41] the cool of the day we will meet him in
[1:17:43] the air second Thessalonians tells us
[1:17:45] also for we which are alive and remain
[1:17:48] shall not prevent or hinder those which
[1:17:51] are asleep for the trumpet of God God
[1:17:53] shall sound the dead and Christ shall
[1:17:55] rise first we which are alive and remain
[1:17:58] shall be caught up together with them to
[1:18:00] meet the Lord in the air Perfect all
[1:18:02] these types therefore the theophany if
[1:18:05] you have died and entered into that
[1:18:08] theophany what happens that the aony
[1:18:10] comes to the Earth to pick up the
[1:18:14] redeemed body and if you're here in the
[1:18:16] air you take the body to meet the
[1:18:19] theophany there you are caught up and go
[1:18:23] to meet the Lord in the air so the
[1:18:25] vision is clear it told us if we had
[1:18:28] listened that our precious brother Billy
[1:18:31] Paul would not be a part of those that
[1:18:33] are alive and remain to the coming of
[1:18:35] the Lord and he has now preceded us as
[1:18:39] many others have before us now of course
[1:18:43] this comes to question and you know I
[1:18:46] made some comments about this that I'm
[1:18:48] going to share with you many of you
[1:18:51] heard of the test testimony where
[1:18:53] brother Billy Paul um told was he was
[1:18:57] there in front of the May building in
[1:18:59] Los Angeles and um and that his daddy
[1:19:03] told him that he would not be an old man
[1:19:06] when um when sharks was swim at the May
[1:19:10] building in Los Angeles and I I just
[1:19:13] want to just say to you first of all two
[1:19:16] things we have been we have been
[1:19:21] absolutely adamantly told by brother
[1:19:23] brandham say what I said on
[1:19:27] tape so you know there are many many
[1:19:29] stories of many many different ones and
[1:19:32] you know many many different ideas that
[1:19:34] comes from these
[1:19:36] stories but you know if you really want
[1:19:38] to know what he said listen to the tape
[1:19:41] it it isn't on tape then put a big
[1:19:44] question mark on anything you
[1:19:45] hear so as as to his daddy telling him
[1:19:50] um that chucks would be swimming at the
[1:19:53] May building in Los Angeles the account
[1:19:56] was not a part of the prophecy and this
[1:19:59] is important because there's a
[1:20:02] difference between us as men speaking
[1:20:06] and God
[1:20:08] speaking so you know we can speak and
[1:20:11] have the human desires and uh ex you
[1:20:15] know human expressions or we can we can
[1:20:18] desire things to be or we can hope
[1:20:20] they're going to be or we can make
[1:20:21] presumptions and uh presumptions and
[1:20:24] brother Brandon said himself uh many
[1:20:26] times he said now I'm presuming here
[1:20:29] that means I'm venturing without
[1:20:30] Authority so we know that as a human
[1:20:33] that he could do this but I want you I
[1:20:35] want to just take you to the service of
[1:20:38] the prophecy that was took place in Los
[1:20:42] Angeles California 1965 on April the
[1:20:46] 29th it was on the evening I believe
[1:20:49] this was at a full gospel businessman's
[1:20:51] meeting and and you know the Holy Spirit
[1:20:54] was moving in a tremendous way and
[1:20:57] brother brandham is speaking here under
[1:20:59] the anointing of the spirit of God I
[1:21:02] want you to listen to the actual
[1:21:10] prophecy stop is man look at your your
[1:21:15] Creeds that you
[1:21:17] serve look at your
[1:21:20] churches is it with the word of God have
[1:21:24] you met ever qualification say I'm a
[1:21:26] good man so was Nicodemus and so was all
[1:21:28] the rest they were fine say I don't have
[1:21:30] nothing to do with
[1:21:32] it and women I want you to look in the
[1:21:37] mirror and look what God requires a
[1:21:40] woman to
[1:21:42] do and see in God's miror not your
[1:21:46] church maror now in God's maror and see
[1:21:49] if you could qualify in your life the
[1:21:52] spiritual of Jesus
[1:21:53] Christ ministers think the same do you
[1:21:57] cut Corners here to save somebody's
[1:21:59] feelings over on would you do this if it
[1:22:01] wasn't it that put you out of the church
[1:22:04] if you are feeling that way my dear
[1:22:06] brother let me warn you in the name of
[1:22:09] Jesus Christ flee from that right now
[1:22:11] that's and lady if you can't measure up
[1:22:15] to the qualification of a Christian not
[1:22:17] as a nominal Christian but in your heart
[1:22:21] and your life is patterned exactly like
[1:22:24] God's marriage system that can ear say
[1:22:26] it has to be and church member if your
[1:22:30] church isn't like that and measure up to
[1:22:33] God's qualification of his
[1:22:35] word get out of it and get into
[1:22:39] Christ that's solom
[1:22:41] warning we don't know what time you
[1:22:44] don't know what time that this city one
[1:22:47] day is going to be laying out here at
[1:22:49] the bottom of this
[1:22:51] ocean
[1:22:53] oh cerum said Jesus thou who exalted
[1:22:57] into heaven will be brought down into
[1:22:59] hell for if the mighty Works have been
[1:23:02] done in solom and gomorah it had been
[1:23:04] standing to this day and solom Gomorrah

[1:23:08] capernium in the bottom of the sea thou

[1:23:24] countries come here to pick up where
[1:23:25] filth and send it away your fine
[1:23:28] churches and Steeples and so forth the
[1:23:31] way you do remember one
[1:23:34] day you will be laying in the bottom of
[1:23:37] the sea your great honeycomb under you
[1:23:41] right now the wrath of God is Bing right
[1:23:44] beneath you how much longer you'll hold
[1:23:46] this sand bar hanging over that on that
[1:23:48] ocean under a mile will slide in there
[1:23:50] come back to the Sal

[1:29:53] messiah the anointed word let us stand
[1:29:57] on our feet in the name of the Lord
[1:30:00] Jesus
[1:30:02] Christ as you can see this prophecy
[1:30:06] never did speak of brother Billy Paul
[1:30:08] and sharks at all but this was a
[1:30:11] conversation they had with his dad the
[1:30:13] days in the in the following days as
[1:30:16] they stood near the May building in Los
[1:30:19] Angeles and my best recol recollection
[1:30:24] was that he asked brother Billy he said
[1:30:27] Billy where are you standing he said
[1:30:29] well I'm in Los Angeles California and
[1:30:31] he said he wanted him be more specific
[1:30:34] he asked him again said Billy where are
[1:30:36] you standing and this time his answer
[1:30:39] was more complete he said I'm standing
[1:30:40] in front of the May building in Los
[1:30:43] Angeles California and to this response
[1:30:46] brother brandom said you won't be an old
[1:30:49] man when sharks will swim here' now of
[1:30:53] course after brother bram's death you
[1:30:56] know brother brother Billy hung on to
[1:30:59] every thread of Hope of his dead dad's
[1:31:03] return and adamantly told around the
[1:31:05] world that he was not an old man even
[1:31:08] when in fact he was and of course he the
[1:31:11] older he got the more he was open to
[1:31:13] question and ridicule he told me
[1:31:17] privately um after I had discussed this
[1:31:21] with the church and the clip was sent to
[1:31:23] him he sent me an email and he said this
[1:31:26] is the the the thing that I'm asked most
[1:31:29] often is this question and he said I
[1:31:32] don't know what to say other than daddy
[1:31:35] said it and I I you know I just posed
[1:31:39] the question was this a father trying to
[1:31:41] get his son to understand the
[1:31:42] seriousness of the hour and his belief
[1:31:45] that an earthquake would happen in Los
[1:31:49] Angeles in days if not months or even a
[1:31:54] year we don't know we just know brother
[1:31:56] Billy has now passed away at 88 years of
[1:32:00] age but sometimes things happen in a way
[1:32:04] we don't
[1:32:05] expect and and of course no Los Angeles
[1:32:09] is not laying in the belly of the
[1:32:11] sea but what about the sharks that are
[1:32:14] swimming at the May building it was in
[1:32:19] 1970 and in those years and that decade
[1:32:23] that brother Charlie Spencer and his
[1:32:25] wife was listening to Paul Harvey
[1:32:29] news and Paul Harvey was one who told
[1:32:32] the news in an interesting way and
[1:32:34] sometime it was humorous unusual events
[1:32:37] that were not
[1:32:38] often reported in the mainstream media
[1:32:41] in this particular report they heard him
[1:32:44] say there had been an earthquake in that
[1:32:46] Los Angeles area and that sharks had
[1:32:49] been seen swimming there near the May
[1:32:52] building now this same report was
[1:32:54] confirmed also by a brother who attends
[1:32:58] brother Jason Watkins Church his sister
[1:33:02] worked in the May building and a memo
[1:33:05] had been issued from management not to
[1:33:07] go uh in certain areas there but sharks
[1:33:11] had been seen swimming there so you know
[1:33:14] um things can happen in ways that you
[1:33:18] don't even
[1:33:19] realize and brother Billy wouldn't have
[1:33:21] been in the old man in
[1:33:23] 1971 when when this earthquake which was
[1:33:27] there was a reported earthquake during
[1:33:29] that time but you know whether they were
[1:33:32] in the drainage ditch or where where
[1:33:33] they was I don't know I don't know all
[1:33:36] the the situation I'm just giving you
[1:33:38] the report you know two witnesses
[1:33:40] reported they had heard the news or
[1:33:43] another had received a memo working
[1:33:45] there at the May building so things can
[1:33:48] happen in ways that you don't even
[1:33:50] expect but but nevertheless even if it
[1:33:53] even if it did or didn't happen it's not
[1:33:55] even a part of the prophecy it's just a
[1:33:58] father speaking to a son telling him uh
[1:34:02] that he believed that it would happen in
[1:34:05] his lifetime that it would be an event
[1:34:08] that would happen within maybe days
[1:34:11] months if not a year but of course now
[1:34:15] we're many years past that but that
[1:34:18] doesn't mean it won't come to pass
[1:34:21] sometimes God's wheels of Prophecy they
[1:34:23] grind slow but sure but they finally get
[1:34:26] there and they come in ways a lot of
[1:34:29] times you do not expect and even though
[1:34:32] that the vision carries uh it causes the
[1:34:35] prophet then to be mocked and I just
[1:34:38] want to say today that we understand the
[1:34:42] vision that the vision um are the the
[1:34:45] prophecy told us about Los Angeles said
[1:34:49] nothing about shark swimming at the May
[1:34:51] building that's a testimony of a son
[1:34:53] speaking about something that his father
[1:34:55] said to him and we don't even know why
[1:34:58] that he said it or what the
[1:35:01] circumstances was it could have been to
[1:35:04] get a young man to realize the
[1:35:07] seriousness of life and the seriousness
[1:35:10] of the hour and to to step up in his
[1:35:14] walk with God now today we're going to
[1:35:17] go from that as I wanted to cover that
[1:35:20] in this first part you know uh and and
[1:35:23] now we're going to move beyond that as I
[1:35:26] go into my sermon today and I'm going to
[1:35:29] be speaking on the birth Pains of a
[1:35:33] nation and uh as you know I re re rep to
[1:35:38] you the vision brother Bram had of
[1:35:41] coming down looked like he was coming
[1:35:43] down the map of Palestine and he was
[1:35:45] coming to the Jordan and he could hear a
[1:35:48] song being sung that was said I'm going
[1:35:51] down to to the Jordan so you know this
[1:35:54] would help identify where he was at by
[1:35:58] the song and and he said as I drew near
[1:36:01] the river I looked back and seen the way
[1:36:03] that I'd come and I was 2third of the
[1:36:06] way there to the Jordan and he said I
[1:36:09] looked across Jordan and I said praise
[1:36:12] God just on the other side is where all
[1:36:15] the promises lay every promise lays in
[1:36:19] the Promised Land now of course he
[1:36:22] wasn't talking about Israel and
[1:36:25] Palestine but he was talking about the
[1:36:28] promised land that we possess which is
[1:36:32] in the Holy Ghost that is our promised
[1:36:36] land and of course it includes all of
[1:36:38] the word of
[1:36:40] God he would go to the end of that and
[1:36:42] he would explain it even a little more
[1:36:45] and said let's cross over now cuz it all
[1:36:48] belongs to us the en vision have never
[1:36:52] failed because they come from God and
[1:36:54] you know we across Jordan the separation
[1:36:58] God break to us the seals that's on the
[1:37:01] back of the book let us enter into this
[1:37:05] great place now for Joshua divided to
[1:37:07] the people their inheritance that God
[1:37:10] has left for them so again he he shows
[1:37:14] us what it means he said you can see now
[1:37:18] what it what coming down to Jordan meant
[1:37:21] that
[1:37:21] we're coming down to the breaking of the
[1:37:24] seals or the opening of the book or the
[1:37:27] opening of the promised land to the
[1:37:29] people of God and this has brought us to
[1:37:32] a great land that the Holy Ghost has
[1:37:35] divided for us it is our inheritance and
[1:37:39] we cannot deny or reject or refuse any
[1:37:44] part of it and neither can we afford to
[1:37:47] let any devil Camp upon it but but after
[1:37:51] possessing it we will also have to
[1:37:54] defend our
[1:37:56] borders it is not enough to possess some
[1:38:00] of it you see we must possess it all
[1:38:04] this is a age where you just can't just
[1:38:07] get a part like justification or
[1:38:09] sanctification or just just a you know a
[1:38:12] part of Holiness or part of this or the
[1:38:15] whole word the whole
[1:38:18] land must be ours
[1:38:21] and we must possess every promise it's
[1:38:24] not enough to possess a understanding of
[1:38:27] the seals being open and yet you're
[1:38:30] lacking
[1:38:31] Holiness it is not enough to possess
[1:38:35] Holiness then and deny that the Seven
[1:38:38] Seals have been opened you see it all
[1:38:41] must be embraced it is a whole land and
[1:38:45] we must possess every promise that lays
[1:38:48] in that land and we must defend our land
[1:38:53] I want you to understand it's not just
[1:38:55] enough to possess it you must hold
[1:38:59] it you see Israel today is in a fight
[1:39:03] for their life and so are we I just
[1:39:07] heard been uh uh Netanyahu say the prime
[1:39:12] minister of Israel said this is our
[1:39:14] second Independence war and we will
[1:39:17] fight on the land the air from the sea
[1:39:20] we will fight on the ground and under
[1:39:22] the ground and in this war we stand
[1:39:24] together this is the fight of our life
[1:39:28] well they' already had one war for
[1:39:30] independence but now they're having to
[1:39:32] have a second war for
[1:39:35] independence and and I I under we
[1:39:38] understand here we're coming down to
[1:39:40] this time where we're at and I feel like
[1:39:43] the same that is you know we're we're
[1:39:46] here in a fight for our life we're here
[1:39:49] in a time where that we must we must
[1:39:52] realize this is for our
[1:39:55] independence this is for our freedoms
[1:39:59] this is for us to possess our land every
[1:40:02] promise that lays in the book now
[1:40:06] brother Brandon and I quoted this to you
[1:40:08] the last time I spoke but I want to
[1:40:10] bring it back to your Forefront again to
[1:40:13] your memory he spoke a a Thanksgiving
[1:40:15] service in sort Louisiana called The
[1:40:19] Invisible Union of the BR
[1:40:21] and it was this Thanksgiving service to
[1:40:24] to to thank God for what we have and he
[1:40:28] said that the the the pilgrim fathers
[1:40:31] were very thankful for their Newfound
[1:40:33] way of life being separated from the old
[1:40:36] English denominations and Creed that
[1:40:39] they could marry to the new anointed
[1:40:42] word for their day that's right the new
[1:40:45] anointed word for their day and we can
[1:40:48] be thankful as pilgrims like Abraham
[1:40:52] separated ourselves from the things of
[1:40:53] the world and all of our Associates
[1:40:56] Abraham was a pilgrim God has separated
[1:41:00] us from all dead religions I'm speaking
[1:41:03] Across the Nation now all the dead
[1:41:05] Creeds and to and to what separated us
[1:41:09] and open to us a new land a new message
[1:41:13] for this day so we we understand the
[1:41:17] message is a new land amen now Israel
[1:41:22] coming out of Egypt was birthed into a
[1:41:24] new land as a nation they left Egypt and
[1:41:29] they were justified by faith and then
[1:41:32] they were Sanctified in the Red Sea and
[1:41:35] then they were birthed into a new land
[1:41:38] the land of Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[1:41:41] their stages of their journey is
[1:41:44] parallel or similar to the church
[1:41:47] justification by faith sanctification
[1:41:51] and then birth into the land of the Holy
[1:41:54] Ghost you see the land that land of the
[1:41:58] Holy Ghost is the land of the Apostles
[1:42:00] Peter John and Paul and this is similar
[1:42:03] to the birth of every believer every
[1:42:06] believer comes through the same Journey
[1:42:09] the Bible said in 1 John 5:7 for these
[1:42:13] three bear record in heaven the Father
[1:42:16] the word and the Holy Ghost and these
[1:42:19] three are one
[1:42:22] understand these three are one there's
[1:42:25] not three Gods these are one you can't
[1:42:29] have the father without having the son
[1:42:32] who is the word and you can't have the
[1:42:34] son without having the Holy Ghost they
[1:42:36] are one and you can't separate them into
[1:42:39] three they are
[1:42:41] one but then verse eight says then there
[1:42:44] are three that bear witness in Earth the
[1:42:48] spirit the water and the blood and these
[1:42:51] three agree in one now they're not one
[1:42:54] but they agree in one it takes the water
[1:42:58] the blood and the spirit to agree or to
[1:43:00] make up one
[1:43:01] birth you see but you can be justified
[1:43:05] without being Sanctified and you can be
[1:43:08] Sanctified without being spirit filled
[1:43:11] but you cannot be spirit filled and not
[1:43:13] have been Justified and Sanctified it
[1:43:15] takes all three to make one New
[1:43:19] Birth now to explain to that you must
[1:43:22] repent of your sins and have them
[1:43:25] forgiven that's justification you must
[1:43:28] be Sanctified and then cleansed from
[1:43:31] filthy habits you cannot be born again
[1:43:33] or spirit filled and still smoke or dope
[1:43:36] or drink or snort or chew or watch porn
[1:43:39] or and deny
[1:43:41] Holiness because without Holiness no man
[1:43:44] shall see the Lord that's Hebrews 12:14
[1:43:48] so you see so it is in the spiritual
[1:43:51] realm is water justification by faith
[1:43:54] believing on God receiving him as your
[1:43:57] personal Savior and being baptized
[1:44:00] second is sanctification of the spirit
[1:44:02] that God cleanses the spirit from all
[1:44:04] the elements of the world and desires of
[1:44:07] the world and then the Holy Spirit comes
[1:44:10] in and gives a new birth and fills up
[1:44:13] that Sanctified vessel truly you're not
[1:44:16] really born again till you get the Holy
[1:44:19] Ghost you're just in the process of
[1:44:22] believing unto now so brother bam used
[1:44:26] for instance or an example he said a
[1:44:29] glass laying out in the chicken yard you
[1:44:31] don't just pick that up and put it on
[1:44:33] your table and fill it up with water or
[1:44:35] milk no you by picking it up it's
[1:44:38] justification you look at it hey that's
[1:44:40] one of Mama's dishes that's one of
[1:44:43] that's one some of our best that we we
[1:44:45] have look here this is a worthy Cup oh
[1:44:48] it's dirty it's filthy it's our out here
[1:44:50] in the chicken yard but then you cleanse
[1:44:53] it you take it in and you wash it
[1:44:56] washing is sanctification is washing
[1:44:59] because the Greek word means is a
[1:45:02] compound word which means cleanse and
[1:45:04] set apart for service it's not in
[1:45:06] service it's just set apart you can wash
[1:45:10] it up go take it back out in the chicken
[1:45:12] pin again get it just is dirty and
[1:45:15] filthy all over again this is a problem
[1:45:17] with many many people around the message
[1:45:20] they go as far as repentance get
[1:45:23] baptized in water and they quit their
[1:45:25] smoking or their doping or this or that
[1:45:27] and after a while the same old evil
[1:45:29] spirit that calls him to do it in the
[1:45:32] first place comes back again and is
[1:45:34] worse than there was at the beginning
[1:45:36] back out in the chicken bin they go and
[1:45:38] it brings a it brings a great discredit
[1:45:42] it looks like the gospel doesn't work
[1:45:45] but if you'll ever get sealed to the day
[1:45:47] of
[1:45:48] redemption amen if you ever get put in
[1:45:52] service in service you're not in a
[1:45:54] chicken pin in service you're filled
[1:45:57] with the Holy Ghost in service you're
[1:45:59] sealed to the day of redemption and
[1:46:02] there's a difference but you see this is
[1:46:05] where many have walked up to even in the
[1:46:09] message they've come that far like the
[1:46:12] pilgrim Holiness did or the Nazarene
[1:46:14] that walked right up even to to
[1:46:16] Pentecost he said you were cleansed by
[1:46:18] sanctification but when you were ready
[1:46:20] to be put in service by Gifts of
[1:46:23] speaking in tongues and other things you
[1:46:26] turn that down and drop back into the
[1:46:29] pin again now that's what happens so you
[1:46:32] see you know why because without the
[1:46:35] Holy Ghost you're going to fall back
[1:46:38] into the M of
[1:46:40] sin now the natural types the spiritual
[1:46:44] I'm going to get into my subject now As
[1:46:46] We Lay the background the natural types
[1:46:49] the spirit spiritual when a baby is born
[1:46:52] of course you know the the water breaks
[1:46:55] but the baby isn't born yet it's coming
[1:46:58] near the time of birth there again so
[1:47:01] there's water blood spirit Jesus said in
[1:47:05] John 3 and3 he answered and said unto
[1:47:08] Nicodemus verily verily I say unto you
[1:47:11] except a man be born again he cannot see
[1:47:14] the kingdom of God verse four Nicodemus
[1:47:18] said unto him how can a man be born when
[1:47:21] he's old how can he enter the second
[1:47:23] time into his mother's womb and be born
[1:47:25] verse five and Jesus answered verely
[1:47:28] verily I say unto thee except a man be
[1:47:31] born of water in the spirit he cannot
[1:47:34] enter the kingdom of God and that which
[1:47:36] is born of flesh is flesh that which is
[1:47:38] born of the spirit is spirit so now
[1:47:41] watch natural typing the spiritual when
[1:47:44] the water breaks the baby isn't
[1:47:47] born and just repentance and water
[1:47:51] baptism is not
[1:47:54] enough and that's been the problem that
[1:47:57] we have faced over and over and over
[1:47:59] again we get somebody you know to
[1:48:01] receive the formula of baptism and see
[1:48:03] that's the way to be baptized and they
[1:48:05] repent of their sins and they get
[1:48:07] baptized that's not
[1:48:10] enough you're not born again yet you got
[1:48:13] to be
[1:48:15] cleansed you know we we then comes the
[1:48:19] blood and by the blood we are
[1:48:23] Sanctified but there can be water and
[1:48:26] blood and yet no life
[1:48:29] yet and as it's being born the breath of
[1:48:32] life has to come in and feel those
[1:48:37] lungs and brother bandam used this in in
[1:48:40] the message birth pains he said but in
[1:48:43] order to get life in the baby you got to
[1:48:46] give him a spanking and make him yell
[1:48:49] out somehow or another we got it around
[1:48:52] in our thoughts that the New Birth has
[1:48:56] no feeling no
[1:48:58] expression this is never brother
[1:49:00] Brandon's
[1:49:01] teaching all the way down to
[1:49:04] 1965 all the way from his earliest
[1:49:07] sermons all the way through he warned us
[1:49:10] against stillborn
[1:49:13] babies babies who were never receive
[1:49:17] life the manifestation of the
[1:49:19] Resurrection and he speaks of this he
[1:49:21] said you know where Jesus when where
[1:49:24] Jesus is there there's always a little
[1:49:26] noise a little upsetting why life comes
[1:49:28] in it brings noise if a baby's born it
[1:49:31] doesn't cry is dead that's that's what's
[1:49:34] the matter with the church tonight we
[1:49:36] need some more weeping breaking up in
[1:49:38] our services when Israel
[1:49:41] travailed children was born when the
[1:49:43] church travails children will be born
[1:49:46] you know again you say but brother Tim I
[1:49:49] I have asked for the Holy Ghost and I
[1:49:51] hadn't got it well go back and look and
[1:49:55] see have you been willing to deal with
[1:49:57] sin have you thoroughly
[1:50:01] repented and and is it just a a dry-eyed
[1:50:04] confession or is it out of the depths of
[1:50:07] sincerity where is this coming from is
[1:50:10] it something I know I need to do to get
[1:50:12] a boyfriend or a girlfriend or is it
[1:50:15] something I know I need to do to be
[1:50:17] socially accepted in this church what is
[1:50:20] it no you have to go back and you have
[1:50:22] to look at your experience and you have
[1:50:25] to say God have I fully surrendered
[1:50:27] everything have I fully yielded to you
[1:50:31] have I fully given over these things in
[1:50:34] my life let you sanctify it and cleanse
[1:50:37] it listen again he said in the
[1:50:38] resurrection he said a baby is born a
[1:50:41] baby's born still birth you you know
[1:50:43] what's the matter with the baby the
[1:50:45] baby's born dead and that's what's the
[1:50:46] matter with a whole lot of stillborn
[1:50:48] children in these formal churches today
[1:50:50] you're born dead you got a conception
[1:50:54] but you never receive life what to do
[1:50:57] with a baby like that is pick him up by
[1:50:59] the heels and give him a little
[1:51:02] posterior Pro protoplasma stimulation I
[1:51:05] tell you he comes alive right quick and
[1:51:08] if there's anything the church needs
[1:51:10] today is a good oldfashioned Holy Ghost
[1:51:14] spanking by the hand of God pouring out
[1:51:17] his power it'll make the church come to
[1:51:19] life now might be SE flat but that's the
[1:51:21] truth you'll spank him a little bit and
[1:51:23] he'll let out a Squall
[1:51:26] crying in the message birth pains again
[1:51:29] he says and you take a a little some
[1:51:31] kind of a shock maybe would I wouldn't
[1:51:34] have to SP him just shock him a little
[1:51:36] the very idea of him being born
[1:51:39] sometimes will do it grab him Shake him
[1:51:41] he don't start breathing spank him a
[1:51:43] little and then he yells out in unknown
[1:51:46] tongues to himself I guess and he anyhow
[1:51:50] he's making a noise and I think if a
[1:51:52] baby is born just by still birth with no
[1:51:56] sound no emotion that's a dead baby and
[1:52:00] that's what's the matter with the church
[1:52:02] today the system we got too many
[1:52:05] stillborn children that's right they
[1:52:08] need a gospel spanking you see so to
[1:52:11] wake them up and to bring them to the
[1:52:13] themselves so God can breathe the breath
[1:52:15] of life into them we know that's so it's
[1:52:18] crew theology but it's the truth anyhow
[1:52:21] again he would say if a baby's born and
[1:52:24] it doesn't cry or do something the
[1:52:26] baby's dead we got two many dead born
[1:52:29] babies in the church tonight that's
[1:52:31] what's the matter with the church it
[1:52:33] doesn't it just doesn't understand it is
[1:52:35] never come to life you know what they do
[1:52:37] with a little baby when it's born I've
[1:52:39] been I've watched them born the doctor
[1:52:41] picks him up gives him a little
[1:52:43] posterity protoplasma stimulation wakes
[1:52:46] him up right quick and he goes to
[1:52:47] squalling if there's anything to
[1:52:49] Pentecostal church needs tonight is a
[1:52:52] good oldfashioned gospel spanking to
[1:52:55] wake them up again the little thing get
[1:52:57] some starch out of them amen someone
[1:52:59] said brother brandom are you holding a
[1:53:01] meeting down there where the people are
[1:53:03] screaming carrying on I said yes sir
[1:53:05] said don't don't you think that's
[1:53:07] fanaticism I said no
[1:53:10] sir there's nobody in the world believes
[1:53:13] in any old time or Old Time shouting and
[1:53:17] blessings and praising God than I do
[1:53:20] I believe that I believe when a baby is
[1:53:23] born it don't move it don't whimper it
[1:53:25] don't do nothing you know what the
[1:53:26] doctor has to do he picks him up by the
[1:53:28] heels and gives him a little spanking he
[1:53:30] gets a little breath in him and I think
[1:53:32] that's what's the matter with the church
[1:53:34] tonight when people say I'm born again
[1:53:38] you know what it is it's a still born
[1:53:42] dead baby it needs a little gospel
[1:53:45] spanking once in a while that'll wake it
[1:53:47] up and get it to whining and crying
[1:53:49] that's right get some life in it that's
[1:53:51] what we need tonight that's what the
[1:53:53] church needs and then getting straight
[1:53:55] on the right path now you might wonder
[1:54:00] what in the world is a gospel
[1:54:06] spanking it must be a scolding or
[1:54:10] balling out from the
[1:54:13] pulpit I I want you to understand it's
[1:54:16] not
[1:54:17] discipline right I want you to look at
[1:54:20] your neighbor cuz you're really quiet on
[1:54:21] me
[1:54:22] today and I want you to look at him said
[1:54:25] it's not
[1:54:27] disciplined okay you got that now you
[1:54:30] see instead it's the action of the great
[1:54:34] physician with the power of God that
[1:54:38] stimulates us to
[1:54:41] believe amen and as you believe and as
[1:54:44] you breathe I mean you squir
[1:54:48] out
[1:54:51] so you know don't get in you know a lot
[1:54:53] of times you know glory to God we're
[1:54:55] going to get the church needs a good
[1:54:57] gospel spanking you think you're going
[1:54:59] to get a scolding or hiding that's not
[1:55:01] what God's doing he is sending a charge
[1:55:04] of stimulation of the power of God to
[1:55:07] bring an Awakening in the
[1:55:09] church so that stillborn babies will
[1:55:12] take a
[1:55:14] breath what can breath eternal
[1:55:17] life the Holy Ghost
[1:55:22] that's right now that's the individual
[1:55:25] well then what about the
[1:55:26] bride who is pregnated with the word I
[1:55:29] tell you what we got to I'm sorry we got
[1:55:32] turned a lot of this into dead
[1:55:34] Creeds and the dead words amen but we
[1:55:38] need a good gospel
[1:55:40] speaking not a scolding not a hiding not
[1:55:43] a bey but a
[1:55:46] stimulation of the power of God that
[1:55:49] makes that word live
[1:55:51] [Applause]
[1:55:53] again you see she has to bring forth
[1:55:57] Life by the spirit the bride too is in
[1:56:00] birth pain to bring back the Son of God
[1:56:04] the world is in birth pains to bring
[1:56:06] forth A New Earth and it's not going to
[1:56:10] do it
[1:56:13] quietly
[1:56:14] no it'll happen for the Millennium it'll
[1:56:18] happen again for the new heaven and the
[1:56:19] new
[1:56:20] Earth brother Bram explained to us the
[1:56:23] world is in birth
[1:56:25] pains and what you're seeing that is
[1:56:28] taking place even in the world right now
[1:56:31] is birth
[1:56:33] pains amen it's signs that there's there
[1:56:36] there is there's coming a a millennium A
[1:56:39] New Earth right that this one is dying
[1:56:43] and it's it's rotten he would take it
[1:56:47] compare it to seed and he said the seed
[1:56:49] has to get get rotten before the life
[1:56:52] comes out of it and as it dies New Life
[1:56:55] comes out and we're living in a Dying
[1:56:58] World with a dying
[1:57:01] Society with a dying
[1:57:05] nation and we're just on the
[1:57:08] cusp of total Destruction for a new
[1:57:13] Earth
[1:57:15] now with the first world war it went
[1:57:18] through its first birth
[1:57:21] pains you know birth Pains come most of
[1:57:25] the time light to start off with in
[1:57:29] comparison to the the final
[1:57:33] push and then that first world war the
[1:57:36] first
[1:57:37] woe they invented a mass killer that
[1:57:40] would blanket an entire
[1:57:42] area I'm not sure all of the chemistry
[1:57:45] of it was mustard gas chlorine glass
[1:57:49] whatever that would would go and and
[1:57:51] then and what they would do with it is
[1:57:52] just saturate a whole area with this gas
[1:57:57] and everything that that was gased there
[1:58:00] would die and people would fear that to
[1:58:04] the point of they believe that the world
[1:58:06] this would cause winds to blow it across
[1:58:10] the Earth and it wouldn't just kill
[1:58:12] people locally would but would be in
[1:58:13] thousands but of course it didn't happen
[1:58:16] as they thought it would but this was
[1:58:17] the fear and then as the pains become
[1:58:21] greater in the second world as World War
[1:58:25] II ended with the horrible Pains of a an
[1:58:29] atomic bomb that destroyed entire
[1:58:32] cities actually would
[1:58:36] evaporate you know just in a moment's
[1:58:39] time entire cities of of of of hirosima
[1:58:44] and nakasaki and Japan would caus them
[1:58:48] to surrender because they had nothing
[1:58:51] they had nothing to counter it and what
[1:58:54] they realize now would be the
[1:58:56] destruction of the entire Japanese uh uh
[1:59:01] lands because of this and so you you see
[1:59:05] it was great birth
[1:59:07] pains and now we are in the thresholds
[1:59:12] of the last wo the third wo the last
[1:59:17] World War is right now upon
[1:59:21] us oh yeah they're warning today that
[1:59:26] you know even in the news that there's a
[1:59:28] new front containing Russia and China
[1:59:31] and Iran together as a new front with
[1:59:35] all the Arabs Nations that they can
[1:59:37] gather to come against the west and they
[1:59:40] are warning there that we are being
[1:59:42] pulled into another world war it's going
[1:59:46] to happen
[1:59:48] church amen man may maybe it seemed like
[1:59:51] it won't but you know maybe it seemed
[1:59:53] like it's just went a long time like the
[1:59:55] California earthquake we were talking
[1:59:57] about that it's bait is time but it'll
[2:00:01] happen and the destruction of the world
[2:00:04] is about to happen in your
[2:00:07] lifetime now I'm not in front of the May
[2:00:10] building and saying to you you know you
[2:00:12] know trying to warn you I'm just saying
[2:00:14] signs of the
[2:00:16] time look where we're at
[2:00:21] never has there been in the hands of man
[2:00:23] the the capabilities now America alone
[2:00:28] has enough bombs to destroy the world 10
[2:00:31] times
[2:00:36] over Russia has twice that
[2:00:43] many we're entering the last threshold
[2:00:46] of the wo or into the threshold of the
[2:00:50] last
[2:00:53] W as they look at it and they
[2:00:56] contemplate what will
[2:00:58] happen Washington DC will probably been
[2:01:02] hit in the first wave of attacks from
[2:01:05] there as counter Force evolves into
[2:01:09] counter value Russian missiles would
[2:01:11] begin targeting larger cities including
[2:01:14] New York Chicago Houston Los Angeles and
[2:01:19] San
[2:01:23] Francisco during the peak of the of
[2:01:25] energy output one megatom
[2:01:29] bomb one megatom nuclear weapon can
[2:01:32] produce temperatures of 100 million
[2:01:35] degrees cels at its Center about four to
[2:01:39] five times that which occurs at uh times
[2:01:42] that which occurs at the center of the
[2:01:45] sun nine countries possess nuclear
[2:01:49] weapons that we know
[2:01:51] about United States Russia France China
[2:01:57] United Kingdom
[2:01:59] Pakistan India Israel and North
[2:02:04] Korea Malachi 4 the very the very
[2:02:09] scripture that tells us that Elijah
[2:02:11] would
[2:02:12] come before the Earth was SM smoked with
[2:02:15] a
[2:02:16] curse you know to call out a rim for his
[2:02:19] name's sake that very scripture opens up
[2:02:22] with verse one said for the day
[2:02:26] cometh that shall burn as an oven and
[2:02:29] all the proud and yay that do wickedly
[2:02:32] shall be stubble and the day that cometh

[2:03:19] for they shall be ashes Under The Souls
[2:03:22] of your feet in the day that I shall do
[2:03:25] this saith the Lord of
[2:03:30] host let's turn our eyes to Israel for a
[2:03:33] moment in the scripture Zechariah 12 and
[2:03:36] verse
[2:03:38] 2 give me verse one to begin
[2:03:41] with Zechariah 12 verse one the burden
[2:03:45] of the word of the Lord for Israel sayth
[2:03:49] the Lord which stretches forth the
[2:03:50] heavens layeth the foundation of the
[2:03:52] earth and forth the spirit of man within
[2:03:55] him behold I will make Jerusalem a cup
[2:04:00] of trembling unto all the people round
[2:04:02] about when they shall be in Siege both
[2:04:06] against Judah and against
[2:04:08] Jerusalem and in that day I will make
[2:04:11] Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all
[2:04:15] people think of this a burd some Stone
[2:04:19] you know here here's the thing that
[2:04:21] troubles the whole world at the moment
[2:04:24] that they're all burdened it's a it's a
[2:04:27] it's a sar in our world today of what is
[2:04:31] happening in the Middle
[2:04:33] East and he said and all that burden
[2:04:36] themselves with it shall be cut in
[2:04:38] pieces though all the world or the
[2:04:41] people of the earth be gathered together
[2:04:43] against it look down at verse eight in
[2:04:47] that day the Lord shall defend
[2:04:49] the inhabitants of Jerusalem and he
[2:04:51] that's feeble among them at that day
[2:04:52] shall be as David and the House of David
[2:04:55] shall be as God as the angel of the Lord
[2:04:57] before
[2:04:59] him and I that day I will it shall come
[2:05:02] to pass and that day I will seek to

[2:06:04] houses inhabitants of Jerusalem the
[2:06:07] spirit of Grace and supplication and
[2:06:09] they will look upon me whom they have
[2:06:11] pierced and they shall mourn for him as
[2:06:14] one mourn for his only son and shall be
[2:06:17] in bitterness for his
[2:06:19] firstborn so there we see Israel will
[2:06:23] turn and recognize the one that they
[2:06:25] have
[2:06:27] pierced you know here's the thing you
[2:06:30] know here's the problem with the with
[2:06:32] the Gentiles even right now they don't
[2:06:36] recognize that the word that they are
[2:06:40] crucifying is the only word that can
[2:06:43] save
[2:06:45] them but you have looked upon him
[2:06:49] who your own sins sent to
[2:06:52] Calvary amen you have received pardon
[2:06:55] and you have receive
[2:06:59] Grace right
[2:07:01] Hallelujah
[2:07:04] now verse 12 of chapter
[2:07:08] 14 and this shall be the plague where
[2:07:11] with the Lord shall Smite all the people
[2:07:13] that have fought against Jerusalem their
[2:07:17] flesh shall consume away while they
[2:07:20] stand on their feet their eyes shall
[2:07:23] consume away in their holes their tongue
[2:07:27] shall consume away in their
[2:07:30] mouth
[2:07:31] nuclear destruction that's
[2:07:36] right the Bible said it would
[2:07:40] happen we are
[2:07:44] here we are
[2:07:47] here Peter said and I'm quoting this
[2:07:50] from future home Peter said the heavens
[2:07:53] will pass away and Earth with a great
[2:07:55] noise such an explosion will rock it
[2:07:58] because it's going to kill every disease
[2:08:00] every thistle every every Thorn
[2:08:01] everything that's be done the fire will
[2:08:03] burn it up and it's not together just a
[2:08:06] literal fire it's also a holy fire we
[2:08:08] take Satan all of his all of his Devils
[2:08:11] both Heaven and Earth amen will pass
[2:08:13] away killing all the germs and insects
[2:08:15] and all natural life around it even the
[2:08:17] H2O the water will will explode think of
[2:08:20] it talk about a
[2:08:23] noise I know some of this is a New
[2:08:26] Jerusalem to come on the other side of
[2:08:27] the Millennium but I also want you to
[2:08:29] understand the world is about to see the
[2:08:32] birth of another
[2:08:35] world well we will walk out on the ashes
[2:08:38] of the wicked now brother Bron you think
[2:08:41] about a little noise out here in tuon
[2:08:43] that was something when he opened the
[2:08:44] six seals That Shook the round country
[2:08:47] round about and caused it talk wait
[2:08:49] until this Earth receives her
[2:08:51] baptism and you know when a man receives
[2:08:54] the baptism of fire there's a lot of
[2:08:57] noise around there they think it's a
[2:08:59] shame to hear people scream and shout
[2:09:01] like that just wait until the Earth
[2:09:02] getes her baptism so brother Bram
[2:09:06] compared the baptism of fire on the
[2:09:09] earth and the explosion that takes place
[2:09:11] and the noise that takes place there
[2:09:14] with the with the spiritual birth of a
[2:09:17] believer
[2:09:19] that when you are born again a lot of
[2:09:21] noise takes
[2:09:22] place amen and it eradicates sin it
[2:09:26] eradicates habits it eradicates come on
[2:09:29] church every kind of
[2:09:32] evil and makes you a new Earth for God
[2:09:35] to dwell
[2:09:39] in think about
[2:09:41] that like I
[2:09:43] preached two Sundays
[2:09:45] ago we have arrived we have crossed
[2:09:48] cross
[2:09:49] over from that inspiration you've heard
[2:09:51] brother Joe and brother Aron both preach
[2:09:53] the
[2:09:54] sermon but I want you just to remember
[2:09:57] that after seven Church
[2:09:58] ages after leaving the Egypt of
[2:10:03] Catholicism where we sojourn like Israel
[2:10:06] in a strange line with pagan gods the
[2:10:10] churches journeyed through the
[2:10:12] Wilderness of protestantism and coming
[2:10:15] through justification of Luther and
[2:10:17] Wesley Sanctified in the Red Sea we come
[2:10:21] up to Cades Baria and tasted of the Holy
[2:10:24] Ghost with ausus treat it was a
[2:10:29] taste but I want to to say we're back in
[2:10:32] the
[2:10:33] land of the Bible we are walking now
[2:10:36] where the apostles
[2:10:38] trod and the fruits have been
[2:10:44] amazing so many got to taste of it
[2:10:49] unfortunately many of them just went
[2:10:51] back camping in the
[2:10:53] wilderness built another camp out
[2:10:57] there you
[2:10:59] know as I Was preparing for this sermon
[2:11:02] I come across some
[2:11:04] things brother Billy Paul spoke of the
[2:11:08] deliciousness of this wonderful fruit of
[2:11:11] this
[2:11:13] land I want you just
[2:11:16] to I want you just to salivate with me
[2:11:20] for a
[2:11:21] moment about its
[2:11:25] deliciousness and this testimony told of
[2:11:29] one Miracle of this good land that has
[2:11:32] seldom been witnessed but it's
[2:11:35] there in fact of the many miracles he
[2:11:38] had seen he said none were quite like
[2:11:40] this
[2:11:41] one it was a little girl that came in
[2:11:44] the prayer line who had no
[2:11:47] eyes all she had was two little slits in
[2:11:50] her cheek with skin over it there were
[2:11:53] no
[2:11:55] eyeballs brother brandham looked at the
[2:11:58] child and said sweetheart you don't have
[2:12:00] any
[2:12:01] eyeballs do you believe what brother
[2:12:03] brandham spoke about you know he was
[2:12:05] told by the angel if you can get the
[2:12:07] people to believe nothing will stand
[2:12:09] before your
[2:12:12] prayers said yes said you believe if I
[2:12:16] pray for you that Jesus will give you ie
[2:12:18] she said
[2:12:19] yes he said everybody put your head
[2:12:22] down brother Billy testified everybody
[2:12:25] did but me CU I wanted to see it I'd
[2:12:28] never seen nothing like like this in all
[2:12:31] the Miracles and he had he'd seen
[2:12:33] Miracles unimaginable ER
[2:12:37] Miracles he he' seen a man who was
[2:12:40] walking like a dog on all all fors on
[2:12:42] his hands and knees and he watched
[2:12:44] brother brandham as he took the chain on
[2:12:46] around the man's neck and raised him up
[2:12:49] while every bone snapped and crackled
[2:12:52] and popped and straightened and went
[2:12:54] went into place as he commanded him to
[2:12:57] stand in the name of Jesus Christ and
[2:12:59] walk
[2:13:00] normal but he'd never seen nothing like
[2:13:03] this just a slit in the
[2:13:07] cheeks and brother Brandon prayed Lord
[2:13:10] Jesus cre in these eyeless sockets two
[2:13:15] perfect
[2:13:16] eyes brother Billy Saidi a witness to
[2:13:19] you I I guess this why I kept my head up
[2:13:22] so I could tell you this I I saw a
[2:13:25] streak come
[2:13:27] down and go into that socket and two
[2:13:30] crystals form I saw with my own eyes two
[2:13:34] crystals form two perfectly normal
[2:13:38] eyeballs brother brandom stopped in the
[2:13:40] middle of his prayer and said the little
[2:13:42] girl said little girl I forgot to ask
[2:13:44] you what color you want your
[2:13:46] eyes
[2:13:48] well I heard that blue was beautiful and
[2:13:50] said Lord Jesus give her the most
[2:13:52] beautiful blue eyes and out of that
[2:13:55] streak came a blue eye and another blue
[2:13:58] eye into each socket and she had two
[2:14:01] perfectly normal beautiful blue
[2:14:05] eyes Hallelujah makes me want to speak
[2:14:08] in other
[2:14:10] tongues this is our
[2:14:13] homeland and in it is amazing
[2:14:16] fruit
[2:14:18] it's delicious and there is more that
[2:14:21] you have not
[2:14:24] discovered you say well how could that
[2:14:26] even be possible to create eyeballs
[2:14:28] listen if God created the first eyeballs
[2:14:32] God can create the
[2:14:34] second thank you Lord this is the land
[2:14:36] of our fathers this is the land where
[2:14:38] Jesus walked this is the land where when
[2:14:41] a man came to him without eyeballs and
[2:14:44] he spot in the ground and with his
[2:14:46] mighty spittle
[2:14:49] rolled him a couple of balls out of dust
[2:14:53] and stuck it into two empty
[2:14:55] sockets and said go wash in the pool of
[2:14:58] salom that's right the fruits of these
[2:15:01] lands is not
[2:15:03] new it's simply new to us but it's the
[2:15:07] original
[2:15:09] word the true gospel that have been
[2:15:15] lost and this is only just showing his
[2:15:18] power amen I I just say to you
[2:15:22] today it's he can do exceed and
[2:15:26] abundantly above that which you're able
[2:15:29] to think or even ask this is a God who
[2:15:33] does impossible things that you cannot
[2:15:37] even think of how glorious and
[2:15:39] wondrous of what he can
[2:15:42] do this is the kind of God that will
[2:15:45] take little fragments of dust
[2:15:48] and bring them out of the dungs of lions
[2:15:51] and bears or tigers or whatever else
[2:15:53] that have been in the Arenas and there
[2:15:56] they were eaten and and there become
[2:15:58] dung on the earth and God take them
[2:16:00] there and bring them back again and

[2:16:37] supposed to
[2:16:39] be this second war for independ is
[2:16:42] exactly what's supposed to
[2:16:45] happen and we too are in a fight for our
[2:16:49] life we can look at the Sodom condition

[2:19:17] a spotless bride he had it at Pentecost
[2:19:21] and she fell away and defiled her
[2:19:23] garment but there is a people in this
[2:19:25] day predestinated not to
[2:19:32] fall you are his crown and
[2:19:35] achievement that he'll lift up before

[2:19:41] and he'll lift her up before the world
[2:19:45] and take her away that's right
[2:19:50] and way she'll go with
[2:19:55] him she has to be exactly like the pure
[2:19:58] bride she was at
[2:19:59] Pentecost before the fall at
[2:20:03] NAA and the vision

[2:20:07] another people in the land who are under
[2:20:10] their messenger are the final voice to
[2:20:14] the final
[2:20:16] age listen brother
[2:20:19] brandham right here in Freeport
[2:20:21] Louisiana you can still go by the Life
[2:20:24] Tabernacle you can look at the buildings
[2:20:26] on the side where where Anna jeene would
[2:20:29] type
[2:20:30] out the first
[2:20:35] newsletters where the type set was made
[2:20:37] for the book A man sent from
[2:20:40] God where they would declare Bible days

[2:20:45] declare to you Bible days are not

[2:21:30] like never
[2:21:32] before as brother Bram would look at
[2:21:34] cross-eyed children and not one of them
[2:21:37] would pass him by without being
[2:21:40] straightened because of what the devil
[2:21:41] did to his child I'm telling you it's
[2:21:43] time for the bride of Christ to get that

[2:25:42] children children beheaded in front of
[2:25:45] their parents and then the parents
[2:25:53] slaughtered CT scans where they're burnt
[2:25:57] into such unrecognizable condition and
[2:26:00] find two
[2:26:02] spines spines of a mother holding a baby
[2:26:06] a
[2:26:09] child mothers burned with their
[2:26:12] babies women
[2:26:15] raped raped aped until their pelvic
[2:26:18] bones
[2:26:22] broken so
[2:26:24] brutal so
[2:26:28] satanic old
[2:26:41] young Israel has defended their
[2:26:45] land
[2:26:48] and they're trying to eradicate those
[2:26:50] demons but let me stop for a
[2:26:53] moment those S same
[2:26:56] demons brother brandham described them
[2:26:58] as the spirits coming from
[2:27:01] Euphrates two 100 million Supernatural
[2:27:07] Chargers and they come against Israel in
[2:27:11] a physical
[2:27:13] Manner and they're coming against you in
[2:27:15] a spiritual manner
[2:27:22] these are
[2:27:23] merciless
[2:27:25] horrible
[2:27:34] beast and Israel defending their land
[2:27:39] trying to eradicate those demon whose
[2:27:42] voice now is being heard in the
[2:27:45] streets whose voice voices are being
[2:27:47] heard all through the streets of
[2:27:50] Europe whose voices are being heard in
[2:27:53] in our
[2:27:56] cities the voice of the
[2:27:58] wicked whose voice is being heard in our
[2:28:02] colleges the voice of evil the voice of
[2:28:06] Sodom
[2:28:07] perversion the voice saying and holding
[2:28:10] up Palestinian flags and say you know
[2:28:13] we're going to we're going to cleanse
[2:28:14] you and push you to the city
[2:28:17] meaning there will be no more
[2:28:26] Israel so much as a hatred so much as a
[2:28:41] Venom and brother brandham told
[2:28:44] us the Same Spirit as a against
[2:28:48] you it comes in ecclesiastical manner it
[2:28:52] wants to take the rejoicing and the
[2:28:54] shadow of the church it wants to keep
[2:28:56] babies from being born it wants to kill
[2:28:58] them as soon as they're born it wants to
[2:29:01] destroy the church it wants to take
[2:29:03] Victory out of the house of God I'm
[2:29:05] telling
[2:29:11] you as I ended my sermon two Sundays ago
[2:29:15] there is another people in the land and
[2:29:18] they too are in pain to be delivered the
[2:29:20] bride is expecting the coming of the
[2:29:25] groom why would brother bandam tell us
[2:29:28] that the bride was pregnated with the
[2:29:30] word if there wasn't going to be a birth
[2:29:32] that's right that's right you come on
[2:29:35] somebody amen and we are in birth
[2:29:39] pains to deliver a bride for
[2:29:43] Christ brother Brandon preached birth
[2:29:45] pains the churches and birth pains and
[2:29:47] out of her would come a a bride and out
[2:29:50] of her would come an antichrist
[2:29:53] that's just as the tribe of Judah came
[2:29:55] forth Jes Jesus and Judah out of out of
[2:29:58] the church comes the bride of Christ and
[2:30:01] the Antichrist they're both
[2:30:03] religious the last sign before the birth
[2:30:05] of the Bride is a word coming to a
[2:30:13] prophet and then out of the word
[2:30:17] is birth the
[2:30:22] bride and we've seen in the
[2:30:26] vision we've been seeing in the vision
[2:30:28] that she has to be that same kind of
[2:30:31] bride the same kind build out of the
[2:30:33] same kind of material that she was in
[2:30:35] the first place and he says Now read
[2:30:38] Malachi 4 and see if we're not supposed
[2:30:40] to have a message in the last day that
[2:30:43] had turned the hearts of the children
[2:30:44] back to the fathers back to to the
[2:30:46] original Pentecostal message word by
[2:30:50] word Brothers we are
[2:30:56] here the sign of the son of man the
[2:30:58] fullness of the
[2:31:00] word was a great great birth
[2:31:05] pains
[2:31:06] now I want to just go real
[2:31:10] quick for a moment because you know
[2:31:13] you're living in a time where people are
[2:31:15] giving tribute to
[2:31:19] God and the and Isaiah 29:13 sums it up
[2:31:24] said wherefore sayi the Lord for as much
[2:31:26] as his people draw near me with their
[2:31:28] mouth and with their lips do honor me
[2:31:31] but have removed their hearts from me
[2:31:33] and their fear toward me is taught by
[2:31:35] the precept of
[2:31:41] men so you know people have been
[2:31:45] taught
[2:31:47] to give a nod to
[2:31:52] God politicians talk about
[2:31:56] God church members talk about
[2:32:00] God but they draw nigh with their mouth
[2:32:05] and with their lips they honor him but
[2:32:07] the
[2:32:08] heart the heart is
[2:32:13] far that's why we live in such a
[2:32:15] religious
[2:32:20] Nation this nation gives a gives a lip
[2:32:23] service to God lip
[2:32:26] service but their heart is an evil
[2:32:32] heart and let me just say brother
[2:32:35] brandham tells us he said but the
[2:32:37] message has been going on for 15 years
[2:32:40] there been no organization from it said
[2:32:42] the Shu was the last we at the end and
[2:32:44] that's why there will be no move move of
[2:32:46] God Beyond
[2:32:48] this this message is the last move of
[2:32:51] God which will
[2:32:53] cresendo in the resurrection and Rapture
[2:32:56] and I just want to say no Prophet who
[2:32:59] Rises no prophet's son who Rises no
[2:33:03] Kingdom Builder will be successful God
[2:33:07] will not bless it it will
[2:33:11] crumble cuz there's nothing beside
[2:33:15] this that's right so you see the birth
[2:33:18] pains brother Brandon said what's the
[2:33:20] matter just a Remnant will be brought
[2:33:22] out and that's why I'm crying and
[2:33:23] straining and pushing and laying every
[2:33:27] aside every favor of man to find favor
[2:33:29] with God and just moving on his word
[2:33:31] Galatians 4:19 my little children of
[2:33:34] whom I travail in birth again to be till
[2:33:37] Christ be formed in you so she's in pain
[2:33:42] he said that's what's matter she's going
[2:33:43] to give birth there's handwriting on the
[2:33:45] wall
[2:33:47] now I'm just going to take the next few
[2:33:49] minutes you know we don't have but one
[2:33:52] service and and yeah I'm taking full
[2:33:57] advantage but I want you to just look
[2:33:59] how close we are to the Fulfillment of
[2:34:03] the
[2:34:06] vision I want you to help me check them
[2:34:08] off
[2:34:10] yes
[2:34:12] 1933 brother brandham received seven
[2:34:16] continuous
[2:34:18] Visions Bonito musolini will invade
[2:34:22] Ethiopia and take it the poor country
[2:34:26] will fall at his
[2:34:28] steps Italy will then try to invade
[2:34:31] other countries but will fail and melini
[2:34:34] himself will come to a disgrace
[2:34:37] disgraceful
[2:34:38] end
[2:34:42] check from Germany the young Austrian at
[2:34:46] Hitler will draw the world into war
[2:34:48] America too will go to war and in the
[2:34:51] process Franklin Roosevelt will be
[2:34:53] elected to the fourth term as president
[2:34:56] Germany will fortify herself Bes an
[2:34:59] extensive wall of concrete and America
[2:35:02] will pay a tremendous price in lives to
[2:35:04] break through this wall but Germany will
[2:35:06] be defeated and Hitler will come to
[2:35:09] mysterious
[2:35:11] end
[2:35:15] check and he would see Europe spreading
[2:35:18] out as a map before him he saw National
[2:35:21] borders altering and reforming into new
[2:35:24] political sections the voice said there
[2:35:27] are three political ideologies
[2:35:29] struggling for dominance in the world
[2:35:31] today fism Nazism and communism the
[2:35:35] first two will come to nothing but
[2:35:37] communism will FL will flourish watch
[2:35:40] Russia the King of the North
[2:35:44] check
[2:35:47] amen tremendous advances in technology
[2:35:51] sweeping over the
[2:35:52] globe among other Marvels he saw cars
[2:35:56] with streamline curves like
[2:35:58] eggs they didn't even have a word to Des
[2:36:01] to Define that until now we have the
[2:36:03] word now is called
[2:36:06] aerodynamics traveling down the road in
[2:36:09] elaborate highway
[2:36:11] system they didn't have no such system
[2:36:14] as we have today even saw a car without
[2:36:16] a driver electronically guided himself
[2:36:19] down the road
[2:36:25] check then he saw women with long hair
[2:36:28] and wearing long dresses marching with
[2:36:31] Packards demanding the right to vote
[2:36:33] when the that right was granted he saw
[2:36:36] them elect a young man as president of
[2:36:38] the United States we're talking about
[2:36:39] John F Kennedy because of women and
[2:36:43] their vote women of women influenced
[2:36:46] politics we went from having no women in
[2:36:49] our sants and Our House of
[2:36:50] Representative till they're filled with
[2:36:52] women and
[2:36:57] queers then he watchs women cut off
[2:37:00] their hair put on pants while others
[2:37:03] shortened their skirts and made their
[2:37:05] blouses skimpier until the coverings
[2:37:07] were like that of fig leaves
[2:37:14] check six
[2:37:17] Vision he watched and There Rose in the
[2:37:20] United States a beautiful woman
[2:37:23] elegantly
[2:37:25] clothed she was either vice president or
[2:37:27] president or something but like that but
[2:37:29] rising in great power wearing purple a
[2:37:33] royal purple and despite her lovely
[2:37:35] features it was a hardness about her
[2:37:38] that defined description great power was
[2:37:41] given to her and she dominated in the
[2:37:43] the land with her Authority he was not
[2:37:46] sure if this was actual actual woman in
[2:37:48] the or the rise of the Catholic
[2:37:51] church we know now it was
[2:37:55] both we have another Catholic President
[2:37:57] come on somebody and a woman vice
[2:38:02] president and can you believe it holding

[2:38:22] kids you know you can't do that and what
[2:38:24] did he do he finds another way around
[2:38:27] it abuse of power on every
[2:38:32] side it ain't just that it's on
[2:38:37] everything biggest sneak we've ever had
[2:38:39] in the
[2:38:44] presidency
[2:38:48] he was not sure whether it was an axle
[2:38:50] woman or the rise of the Catholic Church
[2:38:53] listen I just want you to
[2:38:56] think it was
[2:38:58] both in this last election the US
[2:39:02] elected by
[2:39:04] the by votes of Sucker moms and panty
[2:39:08] wase a Catholic President and a woman as

[2:39:51] rugged men a bunch of women and gays
[2:39:54] have filled not only the ranks but but
[2:39:57] but filled the position of
[2:40:01] officers and now we can you
[2:40:04] know we ought to be we ought to be

[2:47:00] something years
[2:47:02] ago kind of confused me when he said it
[2:47:05] really I didn't
[2:47:07] understand and he said there will come a
[2:47:10] Phoenix
[2:47:12] again it'll be the coming of the Lord
[2:47:14] Jesus
[2:47:16] Jesus and I wondered what in the world
[2:47:18] does that
[2:47:20] meant and then I learned it a phoenix
[2:47:24] was a
[2:47:25] bird in Greek
[2:47:28] mythology that when it got old and
[2:47:31] feeble his eyes all crusty and it was
[2:47:35] now
[2:47:37] Earthbound and it was time for it
[2:47:39] seemingly to
[2:47:42] die and it reached that point
[2:47:45] there would be a fire that would burn
[2:47:49] out I mean bust
[2:47:52] out within that Phoenix and it would so
[2:47:56] completely burned the old bird and out
[2:48:00] of that fire would come a new
[2:48:02] phoenix flying out of
[2:48:06] it maybe it would be today that you need
[2:48:10] to lead that old life of your past and
[2:48:13] Ashes and I there come a new
[2:48:17] life maybe it be one day that we're
[2:48:19] going to leave this in the coming of the
[2:48:22] Lord Jesus all of this what you care and
[2:48:24] you think about and what you've worked
[2:48:26] for and what you tried for and
[2:48:28] everything
[2:48:30] else and it'll just be
[2:48:33] ashes but out of those
[2:48:35] ashes you'll be released into a new
[2:48:40] life I'm asking you
[2:48:43] today
