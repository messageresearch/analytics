[28:41] amen when he steps into the room
[28:44] amen we want to have the appropriate
[28:46] response when he steps in the room we
[28:48] don't want to leave him in the back with
[28:49] 30 feet but we want to entertain the
[28:51] angel of the Lord this evening we're
[28:53] going to go to prayer at this time we've
[28:55] got several needs for the Joe's going to
[28:57] read those if you could make those known
[28:59] brother Joe and then as we go to prayer
[29:01] we
[29:02] certain one we remember those that are
[29:04] needy and body this evening I know
[29:07] surgeries have taken place and some that
[29:10] are scheduled so we just want to keep
[29:11] those close to our hearts Amen brother
[29:14] Joe
[29:16] [Music]
[29:20] amen
[29:21] we have sister Nancy uh who put a prayer
[29:25] request in this evening her sister just
[29:26] recently lost her husband and has many
[29:29] physical issues so she's needing prayer
[29:31] we also got a request this evening from
[29:34] sister Trish Pruitt in regards to Elijah
[29:36] he came down with an ear infection or
[29:39] earache on Sunday and a lot of pain
[29:41] going in his neck they're going to do a
[29:43] virus panel I think this coming up week
[29:45] she's got a lot of pain in his legs and
[29:48] his stomach coming up to his neck so we
[29:49] just want to remember him in prayer and
[29:51] pray that he gets relief and sister
[29:53] Erica Park is about to enter a new phase
[29:55] of her treatment and she writes in and
[29:57] asks for some prayer for that so she's
[30:01] headed to Nashville for treatment
[30:02] tomorrow
[30:04] they give us some kind of name it's IV
[30:06] radiation but it targets the cancer
[30:07] cells wherever they are in the body and
[30:11] says with it comes Usual Suspects of
[30:13] symptoms but I'm believing for a maximum
[30:15] cancer busting effects and minimum side
[30:18] effects that's how you go to the doctor
[30:21] you believe in maximum cancer defeating
[30:24] effects but very minimum side effects so
[30:28] we just want to join with her she has
[30:29] four of these treatments every eight
[30:31] weeks and she just requests us to join
[30:33] in with prayer and brother Wilson had
[30:35] surgery yesterday and he's in a lot of
[30:37] pain with his knee so we want to
[30:38] remember him in prayer and sister Lily
[30:41] many you may know she had like what they
[30:43] would call a stroke-like symptom
[30:45] uh the doctor said the symptoms looked
[30:47] like a stroke but there it's actually a
[30:49] rare symptom of severe migraine called
[30:52] hemiplegia and it numbs the body so she
[30:56] had another episode of that yesterday I
[30:57] think I think it was yesterday maybe or
[31:00] today actually so she's in ICU and she
[31:02] really needs our prayer and uh you know
[31:05] we got Jesus on the main line we just
[31:06] need to tell them what we want
[31:08] you know we believe that God's a Healer
[31:10] so let's let's ask God to do what he
[31:12] promised he'll do for us tonight and for
[31:13] these needs and if you've got a knee
[31:15] just lift your hand up and I believe we
[31:17] serve a God that can not only meet that
[31:18] need but he can go beyond whatever we
[31:21] can even think our ass so father we come
[31:23] before your throne of Mercy right now
[31:24] Lord and we want to say thank you for
[31:26] the opportunity that you provide for us
[31:28] to come in this atmosphere Lord is our
[31:31] songs of Zion have been sung lordly
[31:33] worshiping you and we lord we have you
[31:34] on the main line right now and I believe
[31:37] Lord that the king of Heaven just
[31:38] dropped down into this room today and
[31:40] God we can ask whatever our petition may
[31:42] be and the God is on the other end of
[31:45] that line Lord is here to meet that need
[31:46] Lord we pray not only for the request
[31:49] that were mentioned God we believe that
[31:50] you're able to heal right now and we
[31:52] send your Holy Spirit Lord after sister
[31:55] Erica and after brother James and after
[31:58] Lord sister Lily and and Lord little
[32:01] Elijah we send your Holy Spirit toward
[32:03] them right now on the wings of this
[32:04] prayer and God made you find them well
[32:07] Lord may you touch our bodies Lord may
[32:10] you defeat the cancer and sister Erica's
[32:12] life God made you move even so right now
[32:14] Lord for brother Ross Lord in the back
[32:16] fighting that devil of cancer may you
[32:18] touch his body and strengthen him Lord
[32:20] and brother Ron and many others father
[32:22] and Lord we ask also for brother Tim you

[32:40] life and use them for your glory and
[32:42] bless brother Timothy tonight father as
[32:44] he would come and open the word to us
[32:46] God may we be participators tonight not

[32:53] happen but God may we just put in put

[33:05] of God tonight and invite you to do what

[47:01] revealed from Faith to Faith as it is
[47:04] written the just shall live by faith
[47:07] for the wrath of God is revealed from
[47:09] Heaven against all ungodliness and
[47:12] unrighteousness of men who hold the
[47:14] truth in unrighteousness
[47:17] because that which may be known of God
[47:20] is manifesting them for God has showed
[47:23] it unto them for the invisible things of
[47:25] him from the creation of the world are
[47:27] clearly seen being understood by the
[47:30] things that are made even his eternal
[47:32] power and godhead and so that they are
[47:35] that they are without excuse because
[47:39] that when they knew God they glorified
[47:41] him not as God neither were thankful
[47:45] neither were thankful but became vain in
[47:48] their imaginations and their foolish
[47:50] Hearts would darkened professing
[47:52] themselves to be wise they became fools
[47:55] and change the glory of the
[47:57] uncorruptable god into the image made
[47:59] like to corruptable man and to the birds
[48:02] and four-footed beasts and creeping
[48:04] things wherefore God also gave them up
[48:06] to uncleanness to the lust of their own
[48:08] Hearts to dishonor their own bodies
[48:10] between themselves who changed the truth
[48:13] of God into a lie and worshiped and
[48:16] served the creature more than the
[48:17] Creator who is blessed forever amen for
[48:21] this cause God gave them up into vile
[48:23] affections for even their women to
[48:25] change the natural use that into that
[48:28] which is against nature and likewise
[48:30] also the men leaving the natural use of
[48:32] the woman burning their lust one toward
[48:35] another men with men working that which
[48:37] is unseemly and receive it in themselves
[48:39] that recompense of the era which was
[48:42] meat and even as they did not like to
[48:44] retain God in their knowledge God gave
[48:46] them over to a reprobate mind to do
[48:49] those things which are not convenient
[48:50] being filled with all unrighteousness
[48:52] fornication wickedness covetness
[48:55] maliciousness full of Envy murder debate
[48:59] deceit malignity Whispers backbiters
[49:03] haters of God despiteful proud boasters
[49:06] inventor of evil things disobedient to
[49:09] Parents Without understanding Covenant
[49:11] Breakers without natural affection
[49:13] implacable unmerciful who know in the
[49:17] Judgment of God that they which commit
[49:19] such things are worthy of death not only
[49:21] do the same but have pleasure in them
[49:25] that do them amen will let you be seated
[49:27] this evening
[49:29] also want to look in second Timothy
[49:31] verse chapter 3 and verse 1. it says we
[49:34] also we know also that in the last days
[49:36] perilous times shall come
[49:39] for men shall be lovers of their own
[49:41] self Covetous boasters proud blasphemers
[49:45] disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy
[49:49] without natural affection truce Breakers
[49:52] false accusers incontinence Fierce
[49:55] despisers of those that are good
[49:57] traitors heady high-minded lovers of
[50:00] pleasure more than lovers of God having
[50:02] a form of godliness but denying the
[50:05] power thereof from such turn away
[50:09] amen just want to look at this word as
[50:13] on thankful because you know as we know
[50:15] we're coming into a season that's been
[50:17] set aside or was set aside to remember
[50:20] the things that God has done
[50:23] and so I I thought it was interesting
[50:25] how Paul would put this in the middle of
[50:28] of the invisible things of God being
[50:30] understood by what was made or by the
[50:34] creation that a man something that was
[50:36] created could have the understanding of
[50:39] it or the understanding or the knowledge
[50:41] of the invisible God that that he would
[50:45] allow himself to be shown to them that
[50:47] he would allow himself to be made
[50:49] manifest to his creation but in turn his
[50:52] creation would not think that this would
[50:55] be important or would not be thankful
[50:57] amen that God would come and he would
[50:59] show himself and he would become human
[51:01] he would become man and he would he
[51:04] would give of himself and they became
[51:06] unthankful and they they actually begin
[51:08] in in becoming unthankful they begin to
[51:11] bring forth things that were created
[51:13] like beasts and four-footed beasts and
[51:15] birds and creeping things and begin to
[51:18] exalt them above the Living God and
[51:21] begin to worship the creature more more
[51:24] than the Creator and that's that's
[51:26] backwards because the Creator is greater
[51:29] than the create creation amen and so uh
[51:32] you know it's so his glory the glory
[51:35] that he deserved they begin to give it
[51:37] to something undeserving because they
[51:40] were unthankful for who he was and what
[51:42] he was doing for them and how he was
[51:45] moving in their hearts and lives and you
[51:47] know I got to thinking about our
[51:49] Thanksgiving Day and and I got to
[51:51] looking at some things people were
[51:52] writing about it many are being making
[51:55] it very aware that Thanksgiving day as
[51:58] it approaches there's not much about it
[52:00] in the news there's not much said about
[52:02] it there's not much discussion there's
[52:04] more discussion about Halloween and and
[52:07] then the Black Friday sales following
[52:09] Thanksgiving or the day after
[52:11] Thanksgiving then more than Thanksgiving
[52:13] Day itself he said you know this man
[52:16] said is this American national holiday
[52:18] not important anymore why is
[52:21] Thanksgiving being forgotten and said
[52:24] when Thanksgiving first became a
[52:26] national holiday in 1863 President
[52:29] Abraham Lincoln called it a day of
[52:32] Thanksgiving and praise to our
[52:35] beneficent father who dwelleth in the
[52:38] heavens President Lincoln Proclamation
[52:41] also said the year that is drawing
[52:43] towards as close as close has been
[52:46] filled with blessings of fruitful fields
[52:49] and healthful skies to these bounties
[52:52] which are so constantly enjoyed that
[52:54] we're prone to forget the source from
[52:57] which they come
[52:58] others have have been added ever by the
[53:01] ever and other other benefits have been
[53:05] added by the ever watchful Providence of
[53:08] almighty God Lincoln would continue said
[53:10] no human cancer Council has devised nor
[53:14] hath any mortal hand worked out these
[53:16] great things but they are only the
[53:19] gracious gifts of the most high God it
[53:22] has it has seemed and you know it said
[53:24] it seemed to me uh fit and proper proper
[53:27] that they should be solemnly reverently
[53:30] and gratefully acknowledged as with one
[53:34] heart and one voice by the whole
[53:36] American people so why is our American
[53:39] leaders or or even America average
[53:42] Americans you know why don't they even
[53:45] talk like this anymore they're not
[53:47] thankful they don't even want to
[53:48] acknowledge God in their thoughts they
[53:50] don't want to acknowledge God in their
[53:52] speeches or or acknowledge God in the
[53:55] things that they say and he said you
[53:57] know one of the reasons we have
[53:59] forgotten how to be thankful
[54:02] the intent of this holiday was to be
[54:04] thankful for the blessings from God the
[54:08] idea of being thankful should impress
[54:10] upon us that we are unobserved
[54:12] undeserving of so many good things that
[54:15] we have received but do we understand
[54:17] this today and you know and it says you
[54:20] know they say the Black Friday sales
[54:23] dominate the thoughts of many during
[54:26] Thanksgiving season it seems that many
[54:29] would rather focus on getting things for
[54:31] themselves than focusing on giving
[54:34] thanks to God where all these blessings
[54:37] come from today an attitude of
[54:39] entitlement has replaced the attitude of
[54:42] things thankfulness for many Americans
[54:45] many talk about how they deserve their
[54:48] fair share how they expect certain
[54:50] things or how they how they have a right
[54:52] to have benefits instead of focusing on
[54:55] God and showing appreciation many focus
[54:59] on themselves and their personal wants
[55:01] and many people focus inwardly and they
[55:04] forget to be thankful you know you know
[55:07] he said this man said as a child I was
[55:09] taught to say thank you amen for some of
[55:11] the most simple acts of kindness like
[55:14] someone holding the door for me he said
[55:16] but today you can hold a door for a
[55:18] young generation one of the younger
[55:20] generations and they'll walk right
[55:22] through a door held for them and not
[55:24] acknowledge the kindness that had been
[55:26] shown to them
[55:27] he said if we as parents aren't setting
[55:30] the example of showing thankfulness how
[55:32] can we expect our children to be
[55:34] thankful
[55:36] hey man let's bring that right on I
[55:38] ain't talking about a door being held
[55:40] open for you that's right there in front
[55:42] of you but there has been a door that's
[55:44] been given to us
[55:46] has been opened unto us amen a
[55:48] revelation has been opening to us how
[55:51] can we not be thankful for what God has
[55:54] given us it's more than just a knowledge
[55:57] it's more than just a head knowledge
[56:00] it's more than just you know just a
[56:02] number on a Pew but God has actually
[56:04] given us the revelation of this hour
[56:07] Amen to show us who we are and we who we
[56:10] are and we ought to be the most thankful
[56:12] people not that our our heads are in the
[56:15] clouds and look who we are and who I am
[56:17] and look what God's made us know God has
[56:20] shown me his benefits he has given me
[56:23] his grace he he has given me his Mercy
[56:26] therefore I'm thankful for it and you
[56:29] want your children to be thankful well
[56:30] then you need to start being thankful
[56:32] and you need to start expressing your
[56:35] Thanksgiving unto God and what God has
[56:37] done for you in your life and what how
[56:39] God has moved in your heart I wonder how
[56:42] many children tonight have heard the
[56:43] testimonies of their mothers and their
[56:45] fathers of their Thanksgiving that God
[56:48] helped them cross across an old ocean
[56:50] and on an old ship and they may have
[56:53] went down in defeat but God rich in
[56:54] Mercy allowed them to come and land Upon
[56:58] A firm ground a firm foundation I ain't
[57:00] talking about pilgrims hundreds of years
[57:02] ago I'm talking about us tonight have
[57:05] you told your children how thankful you
[57:07] are of how God has brought you out of
[57:10] sin and out of darkness and out of
[57:12] things of this world and put you on a
[57:15] place that you can stand a place that
[57:17] you can have an assurity that you're not
[57:19] going to fall back from that you're not
[57:21] going to go back but you're going to go
[57:23] forward and you're going to press toward
[57:25] the mark of the high quality have they
[57:27] seen that Thanksgiving in your heart
[57:31] hallelujah amen the Bible foretold as we
[57:34] read of people that would become so
[57:37] self-absorbed and unthankful as we say
[57:40] lovers of themselves lovers of money
[57:42] posters I'm thankful it's amazing he put
[57:45] that right in the middle of all what we
[57:47] would consider big sins and and
[57:50] homosexuality yes let's see but right in
[57:52] the middle of it unthankful
[57:56] amen this really struck me as I began to
[57:59] think on it about five o'clock
[58:01] amen perhaps this is why Black Friday
[58:04] sales dominate the thoughts of many
[58:06] during Thanksgiving season it seems that
[58:09] many would rather focus on getting
[58:12] things for themselves than giving thanks
[58:14] to God he said why he said why is that
[58:17] because we have forgotten God
[58:21] I don't even know if this man's a
[58:23] Christian maybe he must be he said but
[58:25] we have forgotten to acknowledge God's
[58:27] blessings therefore we will start to
[58:30] believe that the things we are we enjoy
[58:33] are solely the results of our own
[58:36] efforts
[58:39] come on now that is a dangerous way of
[58:42] thinking
[58:44] that you're here because you're you've
[58:46] done something we're not here because
[58:48] we've done something we're here because
[58:50] of the grace of almighty God
[58:52] [Applause]
[58:54] you're sitting on these pews not because
[58:56] you're somebody or just because you made
[58:59] yourself something in life you're
[59:01] sitting here because it's of the
[59:03] unmerited favor and Grace of almighty
[59:07] God
[59:08] therefore we should always be thankful
[59:11] to be able to sit on those pews
[59:14] but when people begin to begin to think
[59:17] well I just do it myself and I'm doing
[59:19] this myself it's all about and it's just
[59:21] bro it's just so and so and he's just
[59:23] doing it himself and they become
[59:24] unthankful for the place God has put
[59:27] them
[59:31] it's a dangerous way of thinking
[59:33] notice how even God would warn the
[59:37] children of Israel he says when you have
[59:39] eaten this is in Deuteronomy chapter 8
[59:41] when you have eaten and are full
[59:44] then you shall bless the Lord your God
[59:46] for the good land which he has given you
[59:53] Deuteronomy 8 and 10 I believe
[59:56] that he has given you beware that you do
[59:59] not forget the Lord your God by not
[1:00:02] keeping his Commandments his judgments
[1:00:04] his statues which I command you to today
[1:00:06] lest when you have eaten and are full
[1:00:08] and built beautiful houses and dwell in
[1:00:11] them and when your herds and your flocks
[1:00:13] multiplying your silver and gold are
[1:00:14] multiplied and all that you have is
[1:00:16] Multiplied then you lift your heart is
[1:00:19] lifted up and you forget the Lord your
[1:00:21] God who brought you out of the land of
[1:00:24] Egypt then you say in your heart by
[1:00:27] power and the might of my hand have I
[1:00:30] gained this wealth
[1:00:33] this is where America is they forgot the
[1:00:37] Simplicity of how it all began
[1:00:40] that that God raised this nation up
[1:00:44] they forgot why that it even started and
[1:00:47] now it's not the freedom of religion
[1:00:49] it's the freedom from religion
[1:00:57] instead of feeling self-important
[1:01:00] we should have the same mindset as David
[1:01:02] would have
[1:01:03] who said to God who am I O Lord God
[1:01:07] and what is my house that you have
[1:01:10] brought me this far
[1:01:13] man that's worth reading again ain't it
[1:01:15] that's in second Samuel 7 verse 18. who
[1:01:18] am I oh Lord God and what is my house
[1:01:21] that you have brought me this far
[1:01:26] that I have come to this place
[1:01:28] who am I
[1:01:32] always remembering God is the source of
[1:01:34] our blessings it helps us to stay humble
[1:01:37] and not take things for granted
[1:01:40] he said unfortunately as we look at
[1:01:42] America we see a country that seems to
[1:01:45] be losing blessings
[1:01:48] the nation faces multiple internal and
[1:01:51] external problems and solutions seems
[1:01:53] non-existent could it be that God has
[1:01:56] removing his blessings he has given to
[1:01:59] this nation
[1:02:00] this is them saying this of course we
[1:02:02] know that's true this is a natural
[1:02:04] consequence of a Nation forgetting God
[1:02:09] Jeremiah 18 says because my people have
[1:02:13] forgotten me they have caused themselves
[1:02:15] to stumble in their ways
[1:02:18] because they forgot where it all came
[1:02:21] from
[1:02:22] but even though the United States and
[1:02:24] other nations may be unthankful we can
[1:02:26] determine to make our life one of
[1:02:29] Thanksgiving to God
[1:02:30] amen for all the blessings he has given
[1:02:34] to me and my family amen it all comes
[1:02:37] from him everything that you have today
[1:02:40] I don't care if it's the shoes on your
[1:02:42] feet the socks the pants the shirt the
[1:02:45] dress amen the hair the body whatever it
[1:02:48] all comes from him
[1:02:50] Every Blessing as big or as my new it
[1:02:55] all comes from him
[1:02:56] [Applause]
[1:03:02] well Branham talks about Lazarus he said
[1:03:04] when he left his home he said as soon as
[1:03:06] Jesus leaves a home
[1:03:08] sickness left the home sickness set in
[1:03:10] and sorrow said in listen Christian when
[1:03:13] Jesus leaves your home sickness and
[1:03:15] trouble was set in right behind him when
[1:03:17] he leaves your home get ready for
[1:03:19] trouble because it's on the road you
[1:03:21] welcome him into your home
[1:03:23] you let him be the Unseen guest sat down
[1:03:27] at the table and never eat without
[1:03:29] thanking him for it
[1:03:32] he said I see many people call
[1:03:34] themselves Christians never return
[1:03:35] things just as a litter as a Hogan or
[1:03:38] apple tree a hall can sit on the apple
[1:03:40] tree and Apple's true can beat him in
[1:03:42] the head all day long and he'll eat till
[1:03:44] he can't grunt no more hardly but he'll
[1:03:46] never look up to see where they're
[1:03:48] coming from that's exactly the truth
[1:03:51] people have become unthankful Unholy
[1:03:54] without natural affection truth Breakers
[1:03:56] false accusers incontinent fears all of
[1:03:59] these other things begin to come because
[1:04:01] of unthankfulness
[1:04:10] so here we are living today the
[1:04:12] Pentecost was getting right into it your
[1:04:13] Holiness people going right into it just
[1:04:15] head long
[1:04:16] what a sad sight
[1:04:18] he said well I guess he said well I
[1:04:20] guess I'm a pretty good Christian
[1:04:21] brother Branham you can't be a pretty
[1:04:24] good Christian there's no such a thing
[1:04:27] you're either be a Christian or you're
[1:04:29] not a Christian
[1:04:31] amen a grain of wheat or a grain of salt
[1:04:33] a weed can't be barley today and wheat
[1:04:35] tomorrow it's a week today it's a week
[1:04:37] for always and a man that's become a
[1:04:39] Christian is not a Christian today and a
[1:04:41] sinner tomorrow and a Christian today
[1:04:42] and a sinner tomorrow he seemed like
[1:04:44] Christ yesterday today and forever
[1:04:46] Hallelujah
[1:04:48] because he's become a Son of God and a
[1:04:51] nation we are called a Christian Nation
[1:04:52] well the reason we're called that is
[1:04:54] because we hold that name but just be in
[1:04:57] that name doesn't expel us from the
[1:04:59] judgments of God Amen he talks about how
[1:05:02] things begin though he said look he said
[1:05:03] he said look look at look at all the
[1:05:06] things that begin to take place Upon
[1:05:07] This Nation he said each year is moving
[1:05:10] on and moving on and what is it they're
[1:05:12] more and more forgetting God
[1:05:15] they're more and more forgetting God
[1:05:17] that's the main thing friends we got
[1:05:19] plenty to eat we got plenty to wear we
[1:05:22] gotta find automobiles we're the most
[1:05:24] prosperous nation in the world in the
[1:05:25] midst of it all we don't look to where
[1:05:27] it comes from
[1:05:30] he said it's like a hog under apple tree
[1:05:32] he'll eat apples all day long they'll
[1:05:34] beat him in the head and he'll never
[1:05:35] look up for which way they're coming
[1:05:37] it's just the way we are we're just God
[1:05:40] will pour His blessings upon us and
[1:05:42] we'll never look up to say Thank You
[1:05:44] Lord I'm so glad to be here Lord thank
[1:05:47] you that you give me something to eat
[1:05:49] Lord thank you that you're not moving
[1:05:51] Upon My Heart Lord
[1:05:52] [Applause]
[1:05:54] we just go ahead just like he owed it to
[1:05:57] us
[1:05:59] we owe it to him
[1:06:02] he owes us nothing
[1:06:07] we all we are all we are to him
[1:06:13] another place he says when your eyes
[1:06:15] come open you can see
[1:06:17] he said you might can hear when your
[1:06:18] eyes are closed but when your eyes come
[1:06:20] open you can see then when your eyes are
[1:06:22] open we can see the goodness of the Lord
[1:06:26] there's many times that God has walked
[1:06:28] with you
[1:06:30] he's kept you from the wreck
[1:06:32] he's brought you from the hospital
[1:06:34] and we go on like a hog Under The Apple
[1:06:36] Tree just a southern expression apples
[1:06:39] will beat him in the head all day long
[1:06:40] he'll just grab them and eat them and
[1:06:42] never look up where they're coming from
[1:06:44] that's the way many Christians do the
[1:06:46] blessings of the Lord falling all around
[1:06:48] them and they never get on their knees
[1:06:51] to recognize it come from God what a
[1:06:53] Pity it is
[1:06:56] need to be open
[1:06:58] another reason I should be open is when
[1:07:00] we come to the house of the Lord we see
[1:07:02] a spirit moving and Performing just the
[1:07:05] way he said it was done and we sat with
[1:07:08] our eyes closed and act like nothing's
[1:07:10] happening
[1:07:12] he said I know that's true they sat with
[1:07:14] their eyes closed as well I don't know
[1:07:16] it could be just some mental telepathy
[1:07:18] it can be just a fortune teller but if
[1:07:20] your eyes was open Jesus would come by
[1:07:22] and say it's me it's my word and you
[1:07:26] would begin to thank him for his
[1:07:27] goodness and appreciate him for all that
[1:07:31] he's done for you
[1:07:37] Hallelujah
[1:07:38] sometime ago way down in the Southlands
[1:07:41] he said there was a minister of the
[1:07:43] Gospel he had a man that worked for him
[1:07:45] a colored man
[1:07:46] I called him Gabe
[1:07:50] his right name was Gabriel but they call
[1:07:52] him Gabe for short he was a good fella
[1:07:54] but he just couldn't get lined up with
[1:07:56] the Lord
[1:07:57] he said no matter what we would do he
[1:07:59] would just get out of line he liked to
[1:08:00] play dice and cards and drink a little
[1:08:02] whiskey and he just couldn't stay lined
[1:08:03] up okay he'd like to hunt real well but
[1:08:06] he couldn't hit nothing
[1:08:07] couldn't shoot
[1:08:11] this is endured to his heart this is
[1:08:12] really good so the pastor of this
[1:08:15] certain church he liked to hunt also so
[1:08:16] one day when they'd been out hunting and
[1:08:19] they got shot they had shot so much game
[1:08:21] to the rabbits and the birds were
[1:08:22] hanging all over them late in the
[1:08:24] evening they were coming up a long
[1:08:25] little path and no one had said nothing
[1:08:27] for a few minutes
[1:08:28] and old Gabe just loaded down with game
[1:08:31] title along the path after a while he
[1:08:32] tapped a minister on his shoulder he
[1:08:35] said Parson
[1:08:36] he said tears were running down his
[1:08:37] cheeks he said partially you know what
[1:08:39] I'm going to do I was going to do no
[1:08:41] Gabe what you're going to do I was
[1:08:43] coming down to your church Sunday
[1:08:45] morning I'm going to find my position
[1:08:48] my right right down at the mourner's
[1:08:50] bench and I'm going to come in and
[1:08:52] fellowship in the church and I'm going
[1:08:54] to live true to a god Till I Die
[1:08:58] Pastor rather upset that this quick
[1:09:00] decision came from Gabe after after for
[1:09:02] years trying to persuade those fellow to
[1:09:04] become a Christian he said Dave you
[1:09:06] don't know how much I appreciate that
[1:09:08] how happy I am but Mom for your decision
[1:09:10] but there's one thing that's bothered me
[1:09:12] after all my preaching and I picked you
[1:09:14] up on the street and took your wife home
[1:09:16] when he was drunk to keep keep you from
[1:09:18] getting arrested and all these things
[1:09:20] I've done and still couldn't get you to
[1:09:21] comment and come to church and be saved
[1:09:23] what what made the sudden change
[1:09:25] he said boss
[1:09:27] you know I was a poor shot and I
[1:09:30] couldn't hit one rabbit but look here at
[1:09:32] these rabbits and game that has given me
[1:09:34] surely he must love me or he would have
[1:09:37] never gave me one
[1:09:41] it's simple
[1:09:44] it's simple but if you only knew the
[1:09:47] poor the blessings you possess and where
[1:09:50] they come from the clothes you eat and
[1:09:52] the out of the wearing the food you eat
[1:09:55] he said if you'd ever once been out on a
[1:09:57] mission field and seen them just rake
[1:09:59] out of the garbage and do those things
[1:10:01] he said oh God I my I begin to realize
[1:10:04] the goodness of God how many people that
[1:10:07] would be in Hell tonight that's sitting
[1:10:09] in these seats when you're sitting that
[1:10:11] would give anything to come back and
[1:10:13] said again and have one more opportunity
[1:10:17] he said the goodness of God and we take
[1:10:21] it for granted
[1:10:25] he's so good to come to us on these last
[1:10:28] days
[1:10:29] and call us out of sin call us out of
[1:10:32] denominations call us out of every
[1:10:34] device everything every kind of
[1:10:36] entertainment all kind of and my
[1:10:38] goodness the goodness of God is revealed
[1:10:42] and we sat and stare at it like a
[1:10:45] Mueller looking at a new gate
[1:10:50] foreign
[1:10:51] he says are we guilty of eating good
[1:10:54] food
[1:10:55] enjoying good sight
[1:10:57] wearing good clothes driving good cars
[1:11:00] living in a great nation going to a good
[1:11:04] school and all the blessings we're
[1:11:06] enjoying and yet we never really thank
[1:11:09] him for him
[1:11:13] amen
[1:11:17] it's getting better
[1:11:21] while we're enjoying these blessings
[1:11:24] each one feeling this presence and
[1:11:27] saying amen praise God hallelujah and so
[1:11:29] forth
[1:11:30] and that in that we can remember the one
[1:11:34] that brought all this to us and made it
[1:11:37] all possible
[1:11:39] the death of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:11:41] son of God remember him
[1:11:43] I think that's what many times he said
[1:11:46] one time you know I was amazed when I
[1:11:48] went with a bunch of Christians of a
[1:11:50] certain church and they sat down to eat
[1:11:51] never returned thanks for their food I
[1:11:53] thought that's kind of strange
[1:11:55] went to another house and they just sat
[1:11:57] down and ate and didn't say nothing God
[1:11:59] provides any owl
[1:12:01] he said what about us he said I think it
[1:12:04] pays for us to stop
[1:12:06] and look up
[1:12:08] and see where these things are coming
[1:12:10] for from and how glorious it is to
[1:12:13] remember our Lord
[1:12:15] how glorious it is to remember our Lord
[1:12:18] and remember that there was no one else
[1:12:21] that could make this possible
[1:12:26] there is nothing could make it possible
[1:12:28] but our Lord
[1:12:31] and he so freely did it
[1:12:33] was no worthy person there was no
[1:12:35] Prophet there was no sage no potentate
[1:12:37] no
[1:12:38] Monarch no King no one could do it but
[1:12:41] the Lord Jesus himself and he's so
[1:12:43] willingly did it for us
[1:12:46] let's just remember
[1:12:48] he's done it what he's done for us
[1:12:53] it's starting to go through quite a bit
[1:12:54] of scriptures in Ephesians 5 and verse
[1:12:56] 15 see him then that you walk
[1:12:59] circumspectly not as fools but as wise
[1:13:04] Redeeming the time because the days are
[1:13:06] evil wherefore be ye not unwise but
[1:13:09] understanding what the will of the Lord
[1:13:12] is
[1:13:13] and be not drunk with wine we're in his
[1:13:15] excess but be filled with the spirit
[1:13:19] speaking to yourself in Psalms and hymns
[1:13:22] what the will of the Lord is speaking to
[1:13:26] yourself in Psalms and hymns and
[1:13:28] spiritual songs singing and making
[1:13:30] melody in your heart to the Lord giving
[1:13:32] thanks always for all things
[1:13:40] ouch giving thanks always for all thanks
[1:13:45] you mean the trials I'm supposed to give
[1:13:47] thanks you all things work together for
[1:13:50] the good
[1:13:52] to them that are the called according to
[1:13:54] his purpose how many are they called
[1:13:58] then it's all working for you good so
[1:14:00] you can thank him for it
[1:14:03] God you brought me to the to this trial
[1:14:05] but I know that you brought me you're
[1:14:07] not going to leave me
[1:14:09] but you're gonna take me through it and
[1:14:12] when I get on the other side it'll be
[1:14:14] precious as gold
[1:14:18] amen Colossians 1 12 says giving thanks
[1:14:21] unto the father for what
[1:14:24] because he's made me meet to be
[1:14:27] partakers of the inheritance of the
[1:14:29] Saints and Light
[1:14:31] hallelujah what does that make me it's
[1:14:33] made me sufficient it's rendered me fit
[1:14:35] it's equipment with adequate power to
[1:14:38] perform duties that's necessary
[1:14:42] he equipped me he made me meet I'm
[1:14:45] giving him thanks because he gave me the
[1:14:47] ability to have an inheritance
[1:14:50] and not the inheritance of darkness and
[1:14:52] the Darkness of Darkly on the sin of
[1:14:55] hell that's not my inheritance but my
[1:14:57] inheritance is with the Saints and lies
[1:15:03] so therefore I can give thanks and who
[1:15:06] has delivered us from the power of dark
[1:15:08] there ought to be some Thanksgiving
[1:15:09] going on right now
[1:15:12] he has delivered me from the power of
[1:15:15] darkness and has translated to the
[1:15:17] kingdom of his dear son and whom we have
[1:15:20] Redemption through his blood even the
[1:15:22] forgiveness of sin
[1:15:25] that's something to be thankful about
[1:15:28] Hebrews 13 1 let Brotherly Love continue
[1:15:31] be not forgetful to un entertain
[1:15:34] strangers for therefore thereby some
[1:15:37] have entertained angels unaware remember
[1:15:40] them that are in bonds as bounded with
[1:15:43] them oh
[1:15:45] don't just remember I remember brother
[1:15:48] so-and-so over there and such and such
[1:15:50] he's in bonds no remember them have such
[1:15:53] a compassion
[1:15:55] that you can feel the pain and the
[1:15:58] things that yourself and then they
[1:15:59] suffer adversity as being yourself also
[1:16:03] in the body
[1:16:05] wow
[1:16:07] isn't it hit me upside the head I hadn't
[1:16:09] never read this apparently
[1:16:11] but when you're praying for someone it
[1:16:13] ain't just remember so and so remember
[1:16:15] so but you're entering into amen into a
[1:16:18] a moment of uh what's the word I'm
[1:16:20] looking for I know there's a word huh
[1:16:23] intercession that's the word of thank
[1:16:24] you intercession for them how do you do
[1:16:28] that because you have to actually enter
[1:16:29] into their body into what they're going
[1:16:32] through
[1:16:34] them that suffer adversity being
[1:16:36] yourself also and therefore if you was
[1:16:39] in that body you would be praying as one
[1:16:41] in that body
[1:16:43] if you had cancer you'd be praying like
[1:16:45] one who had cancer
[1:16:49] so he's saying pray for them as if you
[1:16:52] have what they have
[1:16:54] and be thankful that you don't
[1:17:01] marriage is Honorable and all in the bed
[1:17:03] undefiled whose whoremongers and
[1:17:04] adulterers God will judge let your
[1:17:06] conversation be without covetness and be
[1:17:10] content
[1:17:11] with such things as ye have
[1:17:15] well you mean you don't understand my
[1:17:17] situation well I don't but he does
[1:17:23] amen
[1:17:25] made mention of this it's just very
[1:17:28] powerful because
[1:17:29] as I answer any questions about whatever
[1:17:31] situation you find yourself Jesus has
[1:17:34] already dealt with it
[1:17:37] here's what I don't know about yeah he
[1:17:39] said he was tempted in all things
[1:17:41] so no matter what you're finding
[1:17:44] yourself in he's already been there
[1:17:48] brother Danny steamer was just up at I'd
[1:17:50] heard the story before but he brought it
[1:17:52] up to my attention again of a man when
[1:17:54] he was there and brother Ron's I was
[1:17:56] listening to him just a couple weekends
[1:17:57] ago and he said it was a man who was
[1:17:59] dealing with a homosexual spirit I
[1:18:02] actually went out and and and and had an
[1:18:04] affair with another man that this this
[1:18:06] man was a supposed to be a believer a
[1:18:08] message believer and this other man was
[1:18:10] a nomination denominational believer
[1:18:12] but they wanted to be right they knew
[1:18:15] that they'd done wrong and they wanted
[1:18:16] to make everything right and be
[1:18:18] delivered
[1:18:20] they wanted to be delivered so this man
[1:18:22] came to his pastor and he said well
[1:18:24] telling them about you know they come
[1:18:26] and trying to trying to get get
[1:18:28] deliverance and he finally looked at his
[1:18:29] Pastor he said
[1:18:31] I don't know why I'm coming to you
[1:18:32] because you can't help me you don't know
[1:18:34] what it's like
[1:18:35] to deal with what I'm dealing with
[1:18:37] Pastor said you know what he was right I
[1:18:41] didn't know
[1:18:42] I didn't know what to say he said I he
[1:18:44] was exactly right I couldn't say yeah
[1:18:46] I've I've done that or even come closer
[1:18:49] even had those kind of thoughts he said
[1:18:50] I just I couldn't say anything he said I
[1:18:52] just kind of bowed my head like Lord
[1:18:54] what now he said a voice spoke to him
[1:18:56] and said you tell him I have
[1:19:01] he was tempted in all things
[1:19:04] so he knows what it likes so when you
[1:19:07] find yourself in an uncontented State be
[1:19:10] content
[1:19:14] with such things as you have for he has
[1:19:17] said I will never leave you
[1:19:20] or forsake you
[1:19:23] we can raise our hands tonight I
[1:19:25] guarantee you every one of us no doubt
[1:19:27] is maybe five of us are dealing with the
[1:19:29] same thing but I'd say more most likely
[1:19:31] we all have different things we deal
[1:19:33] with
[1:19:34] but with whatever position you find
[1:19:37] yourself in tonight he has said
[1:19:40] I will never leave you I'll never
[1:19:43] forsake you but I'll be with you to the
[1:19:46] end of the world therefore we can have
[1:19:48] Thanksgiving
[1:19:50] in the middle of our situation
[1:19:55] so that we may boldly say the Lord is my
[1:19:58] helper and I will not fear what men
[1:20:00] shall do unto me remember them which I
[1:20:02] rule over you who have spoken unto you
[1:20:05] the word of God whose Faith follow
[1:20:08] considering the end of their
[1:20:09] conversation Jesus Christ the same
[1:20:12] yesterday today do you know what that
[1:20:14] seven means children that means remember
[1:20:16] them who have rule be thankful for Godly
[1:20:19] Parents
[1:20:23] just had to stop there for a minute be
[1:20:25] thankful for Godly Parents well yeah
[1:20:27] they got these stupid rules are they
[1:20:29] really stupid
[1:20:31] or are they keeping you from a wreck
[1:20:37] are they keeping you from some bad
[1:20:39] problems and situations and well they
[1:20:41] just won't let me do what I want to do
[1:20:43] there's a reason for that
[1:20:45] because if you did what you want to do
[1:20:47] you make a wreck out of your life
[1:20:51] I understand
[1:20:53] hey man
[1:20:56] amen well you know I've seen that one
[1:20:58] day you know teenagers need to move out
[1:21:00] while they got it all figured out and
[1:21:01] got it all you know just move on out but
[1:21:03] listen if you did many of you would find
[1:21:06] yourself drug addicts
[1:21:08] and wrecks
[1:21:10] don't don't be resentful the hand that's
[1:21:14] guiding you
[1:21:16] be thankful for them that have rule over
[1:21:18] you
[1:21:21] who has spoken unto you the word of God
[1:21:24] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:21:26] and forever be not cared about what
[1:21:28] divers and strange doctrines but it's a
[1:21:31] good thing that the heart be established
[1:21:32] with great it's not with me Grace with
[1:21:34] not with Meats which have not profit
[1:21:36] them that have occupied their end we
[1:21:38] have an altar wherever we have no right
[1:21:39] to eat we serve the Tabernacle for the
[1:21:42] bodies of these beasts those whose blood
[1:21:43] is brought into the sanctuary by the
[1:21:45] high priest for sin will burn without
[1:21:47] the camp wherefore Jesus also that he
[1:21:50] might sanctify the people with his own
[1:21:51] blood suffered without the gay let us go
[1:21:54] therefore unto him without the camp
[1:21:55] bearing his reproach for here we have no
[1:21:58] continuing City be thankful
[1:22:01] but we seek one to come by him therefore
[1:22:05] let us offer the sacrifice of praise or
[1:22:09] Thanksgiving to God continually that is
[1:22:12] the fruit of our lips giving thanks to
[1:22:15] his name
[1:22:17] it's a sacrifice it hurts
[1:22:24] first Thessalonians 5 18 and says in
[1:22:27] everything give thanks
[1:22:30] for this is the will of God in Christ
[1:22:34] Jesus concerning you
[1:22:37] wow well that pretty much locks it down
[1:22:40] for me in everything give thanks for
[1:22:43] this is the will of God concerning you
[1:22:48] if your situation need to be changed got
[1:22:51] to change it
[1:22:56] he's got the he's got power to do so
[1:22:59] he's a career Creator not the creation
[1:23:03] but many times a creation wants the
[1:23:05] power of the Creator and to make moves
[1:23:08] and make eye a handle think they got it
[1:23:10] all figured out listen it ain't just
[1:23:12] children to make mistakes adults make
[1:23:13] them too
[1:23:16] amen but why not why because they tried
[1:23:19] to play the part of God
[1:23:20] instead of just being thankful and
[1:23:22] content
[1:23:23] God you've put me in this place for now
[1:23:25] or whatever
[1:23:27] you know what I'm saying I understand if
[1:23:28] you're getting a place where there you
[1:23:30] know you can go a lot of different
[1:23:32] directions don't don't go to seed on
[1:23:33] this stuff
[1:23:35] some people get in a church and they're
[1:23:37] preaching false Doctrine well I'm just
[1:23:38] going to be content and all you find
[1:23:40] your church that preaches the truth
[1:23:43] because what he said if I remember
[1:23:45] correct let me go back up there remember
[1:23:47] them which have rule over you which have
[1:23:50] spoken unto you the word of God
[1:23:54] amen
[1:23:56] second Thessalonians 2 and verse 13 but
[1:23:59] we are bound to give thanks always to
[1:24:01] God for you bro Brethren beloved of the
[1:24:03] Lord because God hath from the beginning
[1:24:07] chosen you to Salvation through the
[1:24:10] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[1:24:12] of the truth
[1:24:15] that's something to be thankful for
[1:24:17] because God from the beginning chose you
[1:24:21] therefore no matter what the devil's
[1:24:23] done it cannot unchoose you
[1:24:32] I'm gonna read from second Corinthians 9
[1:24:34] and verse 6 but this will be the
[1:24:35] Amplified so now remember this
[1:24:38] who who so sparingly will also reap
[1:24:41] sparingly
[1:24:43] and he also sows generally generously
[1:24:45] that blessings may come to others will
[1:24:48] also reap generously and be blessed
[1:24:52] Let each one give thoughtfully and with
[1:24:55] purpose just as he has decided in his
[1:24:58] heart not grudgingly or under compulsion
[1:25:00] for God loves a cheerful giver and
[1:25:03] delights in the one whose heart is in
[1:25:06] his gift
[1:25:07] and God is able to make all Grace every
[1:25:11] favor and Earthly blessing come in
[1:25:14] abundance to you
[1:25:16] hello somebody y'all y'all hearing what
[1:25:18] I'm reading God is able to make all
[1:25:22] Grace every favor and Earthly blessing
[1:25:25] come in abundance to you so that you may
[1:25:28] always under all circumstances
[1:25:30] regardless of any need have complete
[1:25:33] sufficiency in everything being
[1:25:35] completely self-sufficient in him

[1:25:42] work and act of Charity as it is written

[1:25:47] benevolent and generous person scattered
[1:25:50] abroad and he gave to the poor his

[1:26:19] administered through us is producing
[1:26:22] Thanksgiving to God from those who
[1:26:25] benefit
[1:26:27] my God Amen what you give actually is
[1:26:32] producing Thanksgiving out of others who
[1:26:35] benefit
[1:26:37] to God
[1:26:39] not to you but the God who gave it to
[1:26:42] you to give
[1:26:49] Mercy for the ministry of this service
[1:26:52] offering is not only supplying the needs
[1:26:56] of the Saints God's people but it's also
[1:26:59] overflowing through many expressions of
[1:27:02] Thanksgiving to God
[1:27:04] did you hear that God is doing this so
[1:27:08] he can be praised
[1:27:11] why do you think you give your tithes
[1:27:13] and offerings
[1:27:14] people people become unthankful about
[1:27:16] that and becomes a burdensome thing and
[1:27:18] well that preacher is doing this and the
[1:27:20] preacher is doing it don't matter what
[1:27:21] the preacher is doing
[1:27:23] that's God's money
[1:27:25] if you give it as unto the Lord is is
[1:27:28] between the preacher and the god what he
[1:27:31] does with it you did what you were
[1:27:33] supposed to do
[1:27:34] therefore if he did and with a thankful
[1:27:36] heart with what you were supposed to do
[1:27:38] God will do what he's supposed to do
[1:27:41] but if you come with bitterness and
[1:27:43] worry and this that and the other thing
[1:27:45] well they're just doing this and they're
[1:27:47] doing that and I don't approve how I
[1:27:49] can't tell you how many people give
[1:27:50] tithes like that I ain't necessarily
[1:27:52] talking about here we got some wonderful
[1:27:54] folks that give give us unto the Lord as
[1:27:56] you can see
[1:28:03] because of this act of ministry
[1:28:07] what up I got I got a minister yeah it's
[1:28:10] called the ministry of giving
[1:28:14] because of this act of Ministry they
[1:28:16] will glorify God for your obedience to
[1:28:19] the gospel of Christ which you confess
[1:28:21] as well as your generous participation
[1:28:24] in this gift for them and for all the
[1:28:26] other believers in need and they also
[1:28:28] long for you while they pray on your
[1:28:30] behalf because of the surpassing measure
[1:28:33] of God's grace his undeserved favor
[1:28:35] mercy and blessing which is revealed in
[1:28:38] you now thanks be to God for this
[1:28:40] Indescribable gift which is precious
[1:28:43] beyond words
[1:28:46] and everything give thanks
[1:28:49] no matter what the situation well
[1:28:51] brother Timothy I'll tell you what when
[1:28:53] the days are good and the skies are blue
[1:28:54] I can really praise God knows when it's
[1:28:56] all cloudy and shattered showers are
[1:28:59] everywhere and rainstorms and thunder
[1:29:00] and Lightnings and your world's turned
[1:29:02] upside down you can still praise God
[1:29:06] it's called a sacrifice of praise
[1:29:09] amen amen that's what God really Longs
[1:29:12] for that's why God allows you to go in
[1:29:15] those places so he'll see what your
[1:29:17] reaction is going to be
[1:29:19] all right well let's read about it Jonah
[1:29:21] 1 and verse 17. now the Lord had
[1:29:23] prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah
[1:29:25] and Jonah was in the belly of the fish
[1:29:27] three days and three nights chapter two
[1:29:29] then Jonah prayed in the Lord to the
[1:29:32] Lord God out of the fish's belly what
[1:29:35] prayed
[1:29:36] and a belly of a whale
[1:29:38] Darkness all around and fish guts
[1:29:40] stinking
[1:29:42] rotten I mean they ain't hardly nothing
[1:29:44] smells worse than a fish
[1:29:47] it's the truth I mean you get a rotten
[1:29:49] fish it stinks this wasn't a good proper
[1:29:52] place to praise God
[1:29:54] but that wasn't what God was looking at
[1:29:58] and said I cried by the reason my
[1:30:00] Affliction of the Lord and he heard me
[1:30:02] out of the belly of Hell cried eye and
[1:30:04] thou hearest my voice for thou has come
[1:30:07] to me in the deep in the midst of the
[1:30:09] Sea and the floods come past me about
[1:30:10] all thy Billows and waves passed over me
[1:30:13] then I said I am cast out of thy sight
[1:30:16] yet
[1:30:18] I will look again toward thy Holy Temple
[1:30:21] and the waters could pass me about even
[1:30:23] to the soul and depths closed around
[1:30:25] about me and weeds were wrapped about my
[1:30:27] head I went down to the bottoms of the
[1:30:29] mountains the Earth with their bars
[1:30:31] about me forever yet has I brought up my
[1:30:34] life from corruption oh Lord my God and
[1:30:37] when my soul fainted with me I remember
[1:30:39] the Lord and my prayer came unto thee
[1:30:41] and thy Holy Temple they that observe
[1:30:43] lion vanities forsake their own Mercy
[1:30:46] but I will sacrifice unto thee with the
[1:30:49] voice of Thanksgiving and I will pay
[1:30:52] that that I about salvation is of the
[1:30:55] Lord
[1:30:58] and the Lord speak unto the fish and it
[1:31:01] bothered him out of Jonah out on dry
[1:31:03] land
[1:31:07] what if he'd never gave that sacrifice
[1:31:09] of praise
[1:31:14] he would have become more than Wells
[1:31:16] vomit
[1:31:22] I'll leave you with that one to figure
[1:31:24] out
[1:31:26] he had been processed
[1:31:28] it had been over
[1:31:32] and there's plenty of wrecks
[1:31:36] and stenches unto the Lord
[1:31:39] because they failed to offer him the
[1:31:42] sacrifice of praise
[1:31:44] of Thanksgiving
[1:31:46] then in the middle of my situation I
[1:31:49] still got two hands
[1:31:51] I still got two eyes that see his
[1:31:53] salvation I still got two ears that hear
[1:31:56] the goodness of God
[1:31:58] I'm still a witness of what he's doing
[1:32:00] Among Us I still see what God is doing
[1:32:06] Psalms 136
[1:32:08] is a whole chapter of Thanksgiving
[1:32:11] oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is
[1:32:14] good and his mercy endureth forever oh
[1:32:16] give thanks unto the god of God for his
[1:32:18] Mercy endurethra oh give thanks to the
[1:32:20] Lord of lords for his mercy and there
[1:32:21] you can get the hint oh give thanks oh
[1:32:24] give thanks to him who alone does great
[1:32:26] wonders
[1:32:27] give thanks to him by the wisdom made

[1:32:39] stars rule by night he to give thanks to
[1:32:41] him that smote Egypt in their firstborn
[1:32:43] that brought Israel from among them with
[1:32:45] a strong hand with a stretched out arm

[1:32:49] made Israel a pass to the midst of

[1:33:18] enemies oh give thanks unto God Of
[1:33:21] Heaven for his Mercy endures forever

[1:33:37] upright shall dwell in thy presence

[1:40:33] and the peace of God that passes all
[1:40:36] understanding shall keep your hearts and

[1:40:45] received Christ Jesus Lord so walk in
[1:40:47] him rooted built up in him establishing
[1:40:50] the faith as you have been taught
[1:40:52] abounding therein with
[1:40:56] it's overwhelming
[1:40:58] Colossians 4 1 Masters give unto your
[1:41:01] servants that which is just an equal
[1:41:02] knowing that ye also have a master in
[1:41:05] heaven continue in prayer and watch in
[1:41:09] the same with
[1:41:11] Thanksgiving
[1:41:15] brother Brandon would preach one of us
[1:41:18] it would be his last Thanksgiving
[1:41:19] service
[1:41:21] in Shreveport Louisiana
[1:41:24] and you preach on the invisible Union of
[1:41:27] the bride of Christ go listen to it he
[1:41:29] said
[1:41:30] this is he said I want to preach on the
[1:41:33] invisible Union of the bride of Christ
[1:41:35] it doesn't sound like a Thanksgiving
[1:41:37] message
[1:41:38] though
[1:41:39] we're thankful
[1:41:41] he said I'm thankful to God to be living
[1:41:44] in this time
[1:41:46] the closing scenes of this world's
[1:41:48] history
[1:41:49] if I would have to have a say so before
[1:41:52] the foundation of the world when God
[1:41:53] would laid out a whole program to me and
[1:41:55] said I want you to preach now what age
[1:41:57] do you desire to go to Earth to preach I
[1:42:00] would have chose this age this is the
[1:42:03] Golden Age
[1:42:06] I certainly would have loved to been
[1:42:08] there during this time of his visit on
[1:42:10] Earth but still I think this right now
[1:42:12] is a greater time because it's the time
[1:42:15] that he's coming to take people that
[1:42:17] he's redeemed he's nearing the
[1:42:20] resurrection with all the redeemed will
[1:42:22] come forth what a glorious opportunity
[1:42:26] we have to speak to a dying people a
[1:42:29] great time we're enthused about it he
[1:42:32] said we know that history is closing out
[1:42:35] world's history will soon be over and
[1:42:37] we'll step into a New Day to a great
[1:42:40] Millennium as one believer in a
[1:42:42] millennium a millennium reign with
[1:42:44] Christ a thousand years on earth a
[1:42:46] physical Return of the Lord Jesus to
[1:42:47] take a physical people glorified by his
[1:42:50] cleansing blood he said we've got a lot
[1:42:53] to be thankful for
[1:42:57] you say well what you may say well
[1:42:59] what's this got to do with Thanksgiving
[1:43:00] what are you talking about
[1:43:03] you didn't say nothing about
[1:43:04] Thanksgiving as he comes to the end of
[1:43:06] it
[1:43:07] he said what a message for the occasion
[1:43:09] to me
[1:43:11] he said the pilgrim fathers were
[1:43:12] thankful for the old Newfound for their
[1:43:15] Newfound way of life being separated
[1:43:16] from the old English denominations and
[1:43:18] Creeds they can marry a new anointed
[1:43:21] word for their age that's right the new
[1:43:24] anointed word for their age for their
[1:43:26] day and he said so can we be thankful as
[1:43:29] pilgrims like Abraham separated
[1:43:32] ourselves from the things of the world
[1:43:34] and all of our Associates as Abraham was
[1:43:36] a pilgrim God has separated us from all
[1:43:38] dead religions he said I'm speaking
[1:43:41] Across the Nation now all dead Creeds he
[1:43:44] separated us and opened to us a new land
[1:43:48] a new message for this day
[1:43:51] Pentecost is dry to Lutheran the
[1:43:53] wrestling and the rest of them's dried
[1:43:55] up there's no no more than a bunch of
[1:43:57] churches they're just all dried up good
[1:44:00] people in there
[1:44:02] what has yet to come out
[1:44:06] wow what did he do
[1:44:09] he opened up to us a new land
[1:44:11] he opened up the Seven Seals
[1:44:14] and he gave us a message showed us where
[1:44:16] we're at showed us where we're going
[1:44:18] showed us who we are and who he is
[1:44:20] the seven sealed revealing himself in
[1:44:23] this hour is blessed Revelation he said
[1:44:26] we got a lot to be thankful for
[1:44:29] Hallelujah he said my he says see he
[1:44:33] says he said see that God pulling
[1:44:35] himself a bride elected God is calling
[1:44:37] the elected is it all down through there
[1:44:39] I'm just pulling out some highlights he
