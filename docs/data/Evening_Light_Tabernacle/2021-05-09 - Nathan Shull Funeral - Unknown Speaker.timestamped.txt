[22:44] an incredible support structure around
[22:46] him he was raised by a family of leaders

[22:54] and those of you here today that served
[22:56] with him or worked with him
[22:59] or interacted with him in any way would
[23:01] say
[23:02] that it showed that the structure he had
[23:05] in the life that he had
[23:07] he was raised by salt of the earth
[23:10] hard working good people
[23:13] there was something about him that
[23:15] wanted to be the best
[23:17] something that wanted to work something
[23:19] that wanted to excel
[23:20] in everything that he did he was driven
[23:24] just like his dad nathan show was my
[23:28] friend
[23:30] many of the memories in my life from the
[23:32] fourth grade
[23:33] up until he left for the naval academy
[23:35] include nathan
[23:38] i have memories from waterman i have
[23:41] memories from the a-frame house there on
[23:42] sugar creek road
[23:45] have memories from the house on drew
[23:47] lane
[23:48] i even have memories from the house
[23:50] there on hartwell
[23:52] he moved a lot
[23:56] but the phone number never changed
[23:59] i dialed 377725 many times
[24:04] the memories start early riding to
[24:08] school with
[24:09] anna and jessica and nathan in the green
[24:11] nova
[24:13] man that was a cool car we were so dumb
[24:15] we thought it was
[24:16] we hated that car you get older you're
[24:19] like man we were going to school in a
[24:21] nova
[24:22] thing was awesome
[24:26] jumping out of the tree house at
[24:27] waterman
[24:29] jessica and nathan they would jump out
[24:33] like they were some kind of gymnasts and
[24:35] land and do something really acrobatic
[24:36] and neat and then i'd
[24:40] trampoline would send me wherever it
[24:41] decided to spend a lot of time being the
[24:44] un-athletic pers
[24:44] an athletic person in my groups
[24:50] riding bikes 100 miles an hour down that
[24:52] hill that seemed to go on forever
[24:54] and you got to the bottom and regretted
[24:55] it because then you had to find a way
[24:56] back up
[24:58] i was too out of shape to ride my bike
[25:00] back up so i'd always have to walk it
[25:01] back
[25:03] camping at mount nebo
[25:07] strapping a canoe to the top of his
[25:09] mom's ford taurus
[25:11] and taking it down to door cheek to go
[25:13] fishing
[25:15] same fort taurus that somehow i let him
[25:16] convince me one night to
[25:18] wait till everybody was asleep and we
[25:20] pushed it out of the carport
[25:22] until he pushed it down the road a
[25:23] little bit drove it around the block if
[25:25] you were just kids
[25:27] drove around the block a few times just
[25:28] because he wanted to see if we could do
[25:29] it
[25:31] we did it stopped about a quarter mile
[25:34] away and pushed it back to the house
[25:41] swimming in the bar pits there at the
[25:43] camp on highway 371 for hours
[25:46] by ourselves either too young to realize
[25:49] it was full of alligators or too stupid
[25:51] to care
[25:56] was a natural runner and like everything
[25:59] that he did when he found out he was
[26:00] good at it or found out he wanted to do
[26:02] it he went out at full force
[26:05] he won all kind of awards around here
[26:06] locally and even became the state
[26:08] champion
[26:09] of louisiana at a sibley high school in
[26:11] distance running
[26:14] once again he excelled
[26:19] i remember the excitement of your
[26:21] appointment to the u.s naval academy
[26:24] i vividly remember the morning you left
[26:28] the breakfast at denny's before you got
[26:30] on the plane
[26:32] off to annapolis in a career in the
[26:34] marines
[26:35] and once again you excelled
[26:40] many of you could come up here and have
[26:41] story after story to tell about nathan
[26:44] memories that you have of him our
[26:46] memories that you created together
[26:49] and i want to challenge everyone
[26:51] gathered here today
[26:53] to let that be what we remember most
[26:55] about nathan
[26:56] the family the friends the memories the
[26:59] hours spent together
[27:01] whether it was car trips to church
[27:04] breakfast before school
[27:05] a camping trip thanksgiving dinner or
[27:08] shoulder to shoulder in the middle east
[27:11] remember the excellence that he strove
[27:13] to achieve
[27:16] i'm not going to let the tragedy that
[27:17] took nathan away from us
[27:19] define him in my memory there's no room
[27:23] in my memory for the negative
[27:25] it's full of positive good memories of a
[27:28] man who excelled at everything he did
[27:31] there's awesome memories success a
[27:34] driven
[27:35] person the tragedy and a and maybe even
[27:38] what we would call
[27:40] the closing scenes of his life here on
[27:42] earth the final days or the final months
[27:45] do not define a lifetime they do not
[27:48] define a lifetime of excellence
[27:50] a lifetime of so much to be proud of
[27:54] in his life nathan spent much more time
[27:57] exhale excelling than he ever did
[27:59] failing
[28:01] he spent much more time winning than he
[28:03] ever did losing
[28:05] he spent more time leading from the
[28:07] front than he ever did standing in the
[28:09] bat
[28:10] his actions in iraq and afghanistan i'm
[28:13] told
[28:14] gave other men the opportunity to be
[28:16] successful
[28:17] the opportunity to return home and today
[28:20] he has given us all an opportunity
[28:24] an opportunity to examine ourselves and
[28:26] our lives
[28:28] nathan's opportunities here on this
[28:30] earth they may be over
[28:32] but for you here today opportunity still
[28:35] remains
[28:37] opportunity to better yourself
[28:40] opportunity for relationships
[28:42] opportunity for making special moments
[28:44] with your family
[28:46] an opportunity to have a relationship
[28:47] with god
[28:50] and as a leader of men one i believe
[28:52] that was respected and loved by all
[28:54] those who fought alongside him
[28:57] i believe that nathan would want each of
[28:58] us today to find value
[29:00] where true value lies
[29:04] he would say no matter how hard the
[29:05] battle is today push forward
[29:08] no matter the heartaches and struggles
[29:10] have your hug your loved ones tight
[29:12] today and treasure every moment don't
[29:15] waste a moment on things that don't
[29:16] matter
[29:18] but turn your attention to those things
[29:20] those people that truly matter
[29:23] to those things which are worth fighting
[29:25] for
[29:26] look to eternal things for they will
[29:28] last forever
[29:30] i believe he would exhort each of us to
[29:32] do that
[29:33] because nathan was a leader
[29:36] one who you could count on when it was
[29:38] danger close
[29:42] rest easy friend
[30:03] that brother aaron at this time we're
[30:04] going to ask
[30:07] nathan's niece and nephew to come and

[35:39] at this time we have gunnery sergeant
[35:42] michael jeremy
[35:46] united states marine corps retired
[35:49] he is here with us today he has a few
[35:51] words to speak he was
[35:53] nathan's gunnery sergeant in his first
[35:55] battalion so we're going to invite him
[35:57] to come and
[35:58] and just say what's up on his heart
[36:00] thank you
[36:03] i hope y'all can understand me because i
[36:04] live uh five hours down the road by you
[36:07] country
[36:08] and i'm not i don't know if i can speak
[36:10] to english y'all do
[36:12] nate and i had a very special
[36:14] relationship what you see right now is
[36:16] very rare
[36:17] you will never see a staff
[36:18] non-commissioned officer
[36:21] talk about one of their junior officers
[36:23] the way i do
[36:25] when nate found out i was from louisiana
[36:28] he automatically became my best friend
[36:32] uh he called he outranked me technically
[36:35] but
[36:37] i was the gunnery sergeant i'm the gunny
[36:39] nate walked into office one day said
[36:41] how's it going mike
[36:44] the marines know about that almost had a
[36:46] heart attack
[36:48] i said excuse me he goes michael
[36:52] i said have you lost your mind and that
[36:55] was basically
[36:56] our relationship and how it started off
[36:58] uh he would
[37:00] eat stuff off of my desk like if i had
[37:04] cookies if i had potato chips something
[37:07] like that
[37:07] nate would eat them and later on be like
[37:09] hey gunny they were good i'm like thank
[37:11] you
[37:12] uh nate
[37:15] was a pain in my butt a lot of times
[37:19] but the thing that i saw nate was he
[37:22] always
[37:23] took a chance and he always pushed
[37:25] himself over the edge
[37:27] and having the experience i had i knew
[37:29] that's exactly the kind of lieutenant he
[37:31] needed to be especially
[37:32] in the infantry because he would have to
[37:34] make quick decisions
[37:36] he would have to take that chance when
[37:38] the time come down to it
[37:40] and when the time came down to it nate
[37:42] was a lion
[37:43] in combat that big smiley face he had
[37:48] oh man i thought that used to drive me
[37:50] crazy i was like why you always smiling
[37:51] but anyway when he got to combat
[37:54] and nate was put to the test nate was an
[37:57] absolute lion he was
[38:00] exactly what the marine corps wanted out
[38:04] of a young officer
[38:06] nate called in danger close
[38:09] a10 strikes within 70 yards
[38:13] of positions and i was bringing up a
[38:16] relief column
[38:18] and he inadvertently actually helped
[38:21] me i'm standing here today more likely
[38:24] because of nate
[38:25] and he didn't even know he was calling
[38:26] in to support what i was trying to
[38:29] support him
[38:30] uh my wife loved nate
[38:34] he uh i lived like i said i live five
[38:36] hours from here nate would show up
[38:38] at dinner time and i would get a phone
[38:41] call gunny
[38:43] what nate hey i'm i'm in your driveway
[38:47] okay nate come on in and he would do
[38:50] stuff
[38:51] but uh it's really hard for me to talk
[38:54] about him
[38:54] because um
[39:06] if i ever had a son
[39:12] nate's the closest thing to a son
[39:15] i would ever have he is exactly what i
[39:18] would want out of the sun
[39:20] he was he'd get in a little bit of
[39:22] trouble had that dariness
[39:24] and give 110 and
[39:28] it is absolutely i tried i was going to
[39:31] write a big speech i opened my bible
[39:34] and i had my notepad and every time i
[39:36] tried to write something these guys
[39:37] would call
[39:38] and ask me it was like the old days i
[39:39] could get nothing done so
[39:42] it's all i had guidance i had guidance
[39:44] just get up here and speak from the
[39:46] heart
[39:47] instead of writing something out and
[39:50] it's the biggest honor
[39:53] of my life to have served with
[39:57] nate and these guys he was
[40:01] absolutely like i said if i ever had a
[40:04] son
[40:05] that would be nate and it's a privilege
[40:08] and an honor
[40:09] y'all allowing me to come up here and uh
[40:12] speak about nate today
[40:14] and um we're gonna missionate
[40:18] we're gonna miss you you uh you pulled
[40:21] out a little bit too early

[40:29] and uh we love you nate and that's
[40:32] a chaplain that cash i'd like to bring
[40:36] you up here this is our old battalion

[40:53] nate's uh chaplain and the chaplain
[40:55] to most of these men here in iraq gosh
[40:57] 16 to 19 years ago
[40:59] and first let me just say to rachel and
[41:02] to jessica and anna and boys
[41:04] uh it's an honor for us to be here to
[41:06] support you
[41:07] and to tell a larger story and to
[41:10] represent the greater marine corps
[41:12] family
[41:13] of which nathan was such a significant
[41:15] part pastor pruitt it is an
[41:17] honor to be here and i want to thank you
[41:19] i want to thank
[41:20] evening light tabernacle for your
[41:21] faithfulness to christ
[41:23] for your example uh in this community
[41:25] for your love for the show
[41:26] family and for your allowing us to come
[41:29] and
[41:30] be here with you today on on this
[41:31] important
[41:33] day of seeking the lord
[41:37] in matthew 21 jesus tells the parable of
[41:39] a father
[41:40] and his two sons we're told a father
[41:44] goes to his first son and he asks him to
[41:45] work in the field
[41:47] to which the son responds i will not but
[41:50] after
[41:50] much regret the son goes and he does the
[41:53] thing
[41:54] the father has asked
[41:57] the father then goes to the second son
[41:58] with the same question go work in the
[42:00] field today
[42:02] to which the son responds yes father i
[42:04] will
[42:06] but in the end this son does not go and
[42:08] do the thing the father
[42:10] has asked jesus asks
[42:13] which of the two sons did the will of
[42:16] the father
[42:19] it's a rhetorical question for we all
[42:21] know that the one who did the will of
[42:22] the father
[42:24] was the one who felt regret for his
[42:26] actions
[42:27] but finally did the thing that was asked
[42:30] of him
[42:32] i have always found great comfort
[42:36] in this parable for it teaches us that
[42:39] in the end a life is not measured by the
[42:41] things we regret
[42:42] for we all have them but rather by what
[42:46] we've actually done
[42:48] in response to the father's will
[42:52] you see god sees the whole story of our
[42:54] lives he sees it all
[42:57] he knows the challenges we faced as
[42:58] children and young adults
[43:02] the battles that we fought that no one
[43:03] else could know about
[43:06] he knows the deep regrets with which we
[43:08] have wrestled in dark
[43:09] and difficult hours the trauma that lay
[43:12] beneath the surface
[43:14] that we may not even be able to
[43:15] articulate
[43:18] he knows those inner triumphs those
[43:20] victories
[43:21] that we won that were not apparent to
[43:24] other people
[43:27] those efforts where we tried to make
[43:29] things right
[43:31] he knows the dark night of the soul
[43:32] where we cried out to god for help
[43:35] in pain and distress he sees the whole
[43:38] story
[43:40] and knowing the whole story he loves us
[43:46] let me mention two triumphs
[43:50] in nathan's story represented by these
[43:51] men who served with him
[43:54] first nathan loved and served his nation
[43:58] at a time when our nation was at war
[44:01] when others were
[44:02] were talking about freedom and talking
[44:04] about courage
[44:05] and defending a cherished way of life
[44:07] nate actually did it
[44:09] he did the thing that god had called him
[44:13] to do
[44:15] he raised his right hand to serve as an
[44:17] officer in the united states marine
[44:19] corps
[44:19] and that service took him to war
[44:23] there's an iconic photo of of nathan
[44:26] that
[44:27] the gun he just alluded to where he's
[44:28] calling in an airstrike in baghdad his
[44:30] eyes
[44:31] are zeroed in on the enemy his face is
[44:33] steeled
[44:34] to make that dangerous decision that
[44:36] would ultimately save lives
[44:39] what an embodiment of that courage
[44:42] and courageous service to our nation
[44:45] that nathan performed
[44:47] and this kind of service pleases the
[44:50] lord
[44:53] i think of the apostle paul in romans 13
[44:55] who talks about the man
[44:56] under arms who confronts evil and
[44:59] defends the innocent
[45:00] this man we are told does not bear the
[45:03] sword in vain
[45:05] but in fact is god's minister in a sense
[45:07] bringing about justice
[45:09] and the fruits of peace and freedom to
[45:12] others
[45:13] nathan as well as so many others many of
[45:16] whom are here today
[45:18] did just that they loved and served
[45:20] their nation at a time
[45:21] when service would mean danger and
[45:23] devotion
[45:24] and we all know sacrifice
[45:31] i've often thought this is why god had
[45:32] such a love
[45:34] has such a love for soldiers and
[45:36] centurions in the bible
[45:39] he understood them their duty their
[45:42] discipline
[45:43] their sacrifice that greater love
[45:47] whereby a man is willing to lay down his
[45:49] life for his friends
[45:52] in fact whenever you open the pages of
[45:54] the new testament you always see them
[45:56] there like
[45:57] like nathan soldiers and men under arms
[46:00] near to jesus or the apostles at the
[46:03] gaining edge of the kingdom of god
[46:05] they're there
[46:09] it was a group of soldiers who were
[46:10] among the first to go to the jordan
[46:12] river
[46:12] and hear john the baptist preach it was
[46:16] a centurion about whom jesus said
[46:18] not in all israel have i seen such great
[46:20] faith
[46:22] it was a centurion who looked up at
[46:24] jesus on the cross and declared surely
[46:27] this was the son of god
[46:31] soldiers centurions guards sailors were
[46:34] there
[46:35] as the church grew to become a light to
[46:37] the nations we think of cornelius
[46:39] a commander of many to whom peter was
[46:42] sent
[46:43] to preach the gospel in acts the ship's
[46:45] guard who conducted
[46:47] the apostle paul to safe passage that he
[46:49] might stand before kings
[46:51] with the message of christ nathan
[46:54] was one of these very men near to the
[46:58] heart of the lord
[47:00] and one who heard the father's call to
[47:02] serve a greater purpose than himself
[47:04] and he did the thing his father had
[47:07] asked him to do
[47:09] he loved and served his nation but even
[47:12] more
[47:12] and i think all these men would agree he
[47:14] loved and he served as men
[47:18] time would not permit me to speak of all
[47:21] the ways that nate loved his brothers
[47:24] but their presence demonstrates that
[47:27] he loved them and he loved them to the
[47:30] very end
[47:31] he took care of their needs to see that
[47:33] their needs were met
[47:35] and not just their physical and
[47:36] logistical needs as a good leader does
[47:38] but i would venture to say their
[47:40] spiritual needs as well
[47:45] in 2002 when it became clear that we
[47:47] were going to to war in iraq
[47:49] general mattis who went on to become the
[47:50] secretary of defense called a meeting of
[47:52] all of his battalion commanders
[47:54] in first marine division to discuss the
[47:57] coming operation
[47:58] and their responsibility as leaders to
[48:00] ensure that their men were ready
[48:03] one of the points general mattis made
[48:06] was a charge to his commanders to ensure
[48:10] that before their marines went into
[48:11] harm's way
[48:12] that all of their marines had an
[48:16] opportunity to make their peace with god
[48:18] that came from the commanding general
[48:22] he told them with everything you are as
[48:25] you prepare you meant your men make sure
[48:26] they have access to their chaplain
[48:28] that they have the moment and the
[48:31] opportunity
[48:33] to pray before we go into battle
[48:36] well alpha company took this to heart
[48:40] and these men know the men i'm talking
[48:42] about captain sokol
[48:43] first sergeant james green nate shaw
[48:48] and many others look for every
[48:50] opportunity they could find to get
[48:52] chaplains
[48:52] to their men and i was fortunate to be
[48:54] one of those chaplains whether it camp
[48:56] pendleton
[48:56] in yuma in the mojave desert at 29 palms
[49:00] or in iraq we spent a lot of time
[49:03] seeking the lord together and drawing
[49:06] strength
[49:07] for the difficult hours that lay ahead
[49:12] and the drill was pretty simple i would
[49:15] roll up in a humvee
[49:16] and we would let the tailgate down which
[49:17] would serve as our makeshift altar
[49:20] and there we would do church
[49:24] we prayed together we strengthened each
[49:27] other
[49:27] by fellowship we opened our bibles and
[49:30] we heard the lord
[49:32] we took communion together we laid hands
[49:35] on each other
[49:37] and the lord was there
[49:42] and that was 16 years ago
[49:46] i will tell you i don't know that i've
[49:47] ever sensed the presence of god like i
[49:49] did in those services
[49:52] i still say that today and
[49:55] nate was a part of all of that
[50:00] he made it happen
[50:04] one of my clearest memories of nate
[50:06] leading in this way
[50:08] was in the fall of 2002 and 29 palms at
[50:11] our combined
[50:11] arms exercise better known as cats in
[50:14] the mojave desert
[50:16] we were coming to the end of that 30-day
[50:18] operation and i had determined on that
[50:20] last day or two
[50:21] that if i could find alpha company
[50:23] before the sun went down
[50:24] i would provide a worship service for
[50:26] them well i tried
[50:28] i looked my rp and i who's my assistant
[50:30] drove
[50:31] uh as as best we could we could not find
[50:34] them before night fell
[50:36] and so the sun went down darkness
[50:38] descended and i went into my tent
[50:42] about an hour later i heard a voice and
[50:44] it was nate's
[50:46] a voice in the dark chaplin
[50:49] has anyone seen the chaplain
[50:52] where is the chaplain i leaned out my
[50:56] head from the tent
[50:57] and all i could see was the red lens
[51:00] flashlight waving around and his voice
[51:03] yelling as loud as he could
[51:05] while maintaining noise discipline
[51:07] chaplain where is the chaplain
[51:10] i went out i said nate i'm here he said
[51:13] sir
[51:16] alpha company's assembled we're ready
[51:21] follow me
[51:25] so i got my red lens flashlight i got in
[51:27] my humvee with my assistant
[51:29] and we followed nate through the dark
[51:32] and dust of that mountainous terrain
[51:34] where he led me to alpha company 1-5
[51:36] and there 130 marines on the side of a
[51:39] hill were waiting
[51:40] to worship the lord under the brightest
[51:43] stars i've ever seen
[51:48] my text that night was very simple
[51:51] second timothy 1 7
[51:55] for god has not given you a spirit of
[51:56] fear
[51:58] but power love and a sound mind
[52:06] brothers and sisters i think in a very
[52:08] real way
[52:09] nate is leading us once again to that
[52:11] place
[52:14] i don't see a red lens flashlight waving
[52:16] right now but i
[52:18] do see through his life and his death
[52:22] nate calling us with some urgency
[52:26] to consider that great promise
[52:30] for god has not given you a spirit of
[52:33] fear
[52:34] but power and love
[52:37] and a sound mind to the shoal family
[52:42] to rachel to anna
[52:45] and jessica boys
[52:49] god has not given you a spirit of fear
[52:51] for he walks with you
[52:54] he walks with you
[52:58] you can trust him to give you the power
[53:01] and the strength you need
[53:02] to walk in love for each other
[53:06] and find his peace amidst great loss
[53:10] for the lord is good a strong hold in
[53:13] the day of trouble
[53:15] and he knows those who trust in him
[53:20] to the marines of first battalion fifth
[53:22] marines and alpha company
[53:23] and others who served with nate
[53:28] god has not given us a spirit of fear
[53:30] but power
[53:31] love and a sound mind
[53:35] the challenges difficulties and battles
[53:38] you have all faced
[53:40] the small steps of faithfulness and
[53:42] victories that no one sees
[53:44] the lord knows all about it
[53:47] he sees the whole story of your life and
[53:49] my life
[53:51] and he loves you and the lord doesn't
[53:54] speak in tones of fear and judgment
[53:56] for that is not why he came but rather
[53:59] grace
[54:00] and mercy and forgiveness and love
[54:03] and power to follow him
[54:07] if we will turn our eyes upon the lord
[54:10] and follow nate's lead
[54:14] we will know his presence and a sound
[54:17] mind
[54:18] no matter what battles we have fought no
[54:21] matter what wounds we have felt
[54:24] for he will keep them in perfect peace
[54:27] whose mind is stayed upon him
[54:30] thanks be to god for the life of nathan
[54:32] shaw thanks be to god for the promise of
[54:35] the holy spirit
[54:36] who binds our wounds and strengthens our
[54:38] hearts and thanks be to god
[54:40] for his most indescribable gift in his
[54:43] son jesus christ

[1:03:11] control
[1:03:12] we need an anchor we need someone for
[1:03:15] strength
[1:03:16] and we have almighty god for that i'd
[1:03:19] like to read
[1:03:20] from the word of god this afternoon from
[1:03:23] john chapter 3 verse 14
[1:03:26] which says as moses lifted up the
[1:03:29] serpent
[1:03:30] in the wilderness even so must the son
[1:03:33] of man be lifted up
[1:03:35] that whosoever believeth in him should
[1:03:37] not perish
[1:03:38] but have eternal life so
[1:03:42] for god so loved the world that he gave
[1:03:45] his only begotten
[1:03:46] son that whosoever believeth in him
[1:03:49] should not perish
[1:03:50] but have everlasting life for god sent
[1:03:54] not his son into the worlds who
[1:03:55] condemned the world
[1:03:57] but that the world through him might be
[1:04:00] saved
[1:04:01] he that believeth on him is not
[1:04:03] condemned but he that believeth not on
[1:04:06] him
[1:04:07] not is condemned already because
[1:04:10] he hath not believed in the name of the
[1:04:13] only begotten son of god
[1:04:18] the salt family here has been really
[1:04:21] faithful members of eden and light
[1:04:23] tabernacle for nearly
[1:04:24] four decades and brother jerry shells
[1:04:27] served as one as our deacons here in
[1:04:30] this church for
[1:04:31] nearly almost that long as well and we
[1:04:34] want to express
[1:04:35] our love to sister rachel brother joe's
[1:04:38] sister jessica
[1:04:40] and family and brother craig and sister
[1:04:43] anna booer
[1:04:44] and their family today as we share
[1:04:48] um in this moment as we tribute
[1:04:52] give tribute to their
[1:04:55] loved one nathan that we all loved the
[1:04:58] awful news of nathan's passing reached
[1:05:01] all of us as we were intending an
[1:05:03] old-fashioned
[1:05:04] tent revival in virginia and
[1:05:09] god had just divinely
[1:05:12] orchestrated it that sister rachel would
[1:05:15] receive this news
[1:05:17] and she would be surrounded there by her
[1:05:18] daughters and some very dear friends of
[1:05:20] hers and
[1:05:22] and each day the family was ministered
[1:05:25] to and was supported by the word of god
[1:05:27] and
[1:05:27] the love and the prayers of many saints
[1:05:30] and all of this reminds us
[1:05:33] of how mindful that god is
[1:05:36] in our time of need and we've read today
[1:05:40] of a wonderful savior our god who is a
[1:05:43] loving god who is not willing that any
[1:05:46] should perish
[1:05:49] in fact god so loved the world that he
[1:05:51] left all of heaven to come to earth
[1:05:54] and he took on flesh to be one of us
[1:05:57] to fight the same human battles that we
[1:06:00] fight and he did it
[1:06:02] all for the purpose of redemption
[1:06:06] and jesus did not come to condemn the
[1:06:08] world but that the world through him
[1:06:10] might be saved and i'm so glad today
[1:06:14] as we stand here that today is
[1:06:17] not a day of judgment and times like
[1:06:20] these
[1:06:20] do not require us to make a decision of
[1:06:24] anyone's destiny
[1:06:26] except that of our own and today
[1:06:29] though is a day of mercy it is a day of
[1:06:33] grace it is
[1:06:34] a time where love is held out to all who
[1:06:37] will accept
[1:06:38] god's pardon and grace and mercies the
[1:06:41] book of james says
[1:06:42] there will be no mercy for those who
[1:06:44] have not shown mercy
[1:06:46] to others but if you have been merciful
[1:06:49] god will be merciful when he judges you
[1:06:52] so instead of passing judgment we are
[1:06:54] here today to show
[1:06:56] mercy love and give comfort and this is
[1:07:00] the day we can
[1:07:01] put our loved ones into the hands of a
[1:07:04] just and merciful god
[1:07:06] who understands the heart of man and who
[1:07:09] was unwilling that any man should perish
[1:07:12] but
[1:07:12] wants to give life more than he wants to
[1:07:15] give death
[1:07:18] so we're here today to commit nathan
[1:07:20] into the hands of a god who knows the
[1:07:23] heart
[1:07:23] and a god who is so rich in mercy
[1:07:28] today is a day that we must trust
[1:07:31] where we have to trust in a god
[1:07:35] knowing that there is no one more kinder
[1:07:37] more gentle more loving
[1:07:39] more understanding who judges the heart
[1:07:42] and not just the actions of man proverbs
[1:07:46] 3 and 5 tells us to trust in the lord
[1:07:49] with all thine heart
[1:07:51] and lean not to thy known understanding
[1:07:53] but in all thy ways acknowledge him and
[1:07:56] he will direct that path so we are here
[1:07:59] today to
[1:08:00] trust in the lord and to acknowledge him
[1:08:03] so he can do that direct our path
[1:08:07] the question that we often ponder
[1:08:11] is why would god take the life of the
[1:08:14] ones we love
[1:08:16] but let me tell you today that's not the
[1:08:18] god that i know and it's not the god of
[1:08:20] the bible
[1:08:22] this is something though that many
[1:08:24] people misunderstand about god they
[1:08:27] think of him as
[1:08:28] a heartless being that would rip a
[1:08:31] person
[1:08:32] from the earth as nathan was in this
[1:08:34] horrible
[1:08:35] incident but this is not god's doing
[1:08:40] god is not the cause of death rather he
[1:08:43] is the cause and the giver of life
[1:08:46] so how is this that this happens
[1:08:49] we would have to go back in the
[1:08:51] beginning and see
[1:08:53] what the bible says that in the
[1:08:55] beginning god created the heavens and
[1:08:57] the earth
[1:08:58] and he brought forth the light upon the
[1:09:00] earth and he saw the light and said
[1:09:03] it is good and then he separated the
[1:09:06] land from the seas and god saw that and
[1:09:08] he said
[1:09:09] it was good and then god planted the
[1:09:12] earth
[1:09:13] with grass and trees and god saw that
[1:09:16] it was good and then god placed life
[1:09:19] into the oceans upon dry ground and
[1:09:21] god saw it was good
[1:09:25] and finally the scripture sums it all up
[1:09:29] and god saw everything that he had made
[1:09:32] and behold it was
[1:09:33] very good so god made everything on
[1:09:37] earth good
[1:09:38] and perfect just like heaven will be
[1:09:42] in fact earth was like an
[1:09:45] extension of heaven eden was a paradise
[1:09:48] of perfection
[1:09:50] it was literally heaven on the earth
[1:09:53] in god's eden there was no death so
[1:09:56] there were no graves
[1:09:58] there we were never to experience a
[1:09:59] heartache or separation
[1:10:03] yet there was this potential
[1:10:06] that life could be turned into death and
[1:10:09] the earth
[1:10:10] turned to satan's rule where death would
[1:10:13] reign
[1:10:15] but this responsible and loving father
[1:10:17] of ours warned
[1:10:19] his son adam that there was a tree that
[1:10:21] they were not to partake of
[1:10:23] for by taking of the fruit of knowledge
[1:10:26] they would come to know death and dying
[1:10:30] and by acting upon this knowledge it
[1:10:32] would cause
[1:10:33] very heart-wrenching pain and the
[1:10:36] partaking of this knowledge would be
[1:10:38] the reason that we would need hospitals
[1:10:41] and doctors and medicines
[1:10:43] to try to alleviate some of the
[1:10:45] suffering
[1:10:46] that mankind experiences this fruit of
[1:10:49] knowledge would cause
[1:10:51] the sorrow that we feel today
[1:10:54] it would cause every grave that would
[1:10:56] come on the earth and the tears of
[1:10:59] sorrow where we would lay down our loved
[1:11:01] ones
[1:11:03] but god was diligent to warn man of this
[1:11:05] tree of death because
[1:11:07] god didn't want us to experience this
[1:11:09] heartache
[1:11:11] because by taking this tree
[1:11:14] of this tree and the fruit of this
[1:11:16] knowledge man would come
[1:11:18] by this knowledge to know every kind of
[1:11:21] sin
[1:11:22] pain suffering mortality
[1:11:25] and death but god did not want man to
[1:11:29] die
[1:11:30] it was not his will he did not want man
[1:11:33] to experience
[1:11:34] pain and suffering but yet he didn't
[1:11:37] force his will upon man but
[1:11:39] rather left it to his choice
[1:11:43] and for a time man would enjoy heaven on
[1:11:46] earth
[1:11:47] in god's eden where everything was good
[1:11:51] but then they chose knowledge and they
[1:11:53] partook
[1:11:54] of the tree of death rather than the
[1:11:56] tree of life
[1:11:58] and now every human would be born in
[1:12:01] bodies that would be mortal and because
[1:12:04] they were mortal
[1:12:05] they would get sick and die
[1:12:09] or become injured and leave the earth
[1:12:13] our first parents then experienced the
[1:12:16] pain of separation by death when
[1:12:18] jealousy turned to hate
[1:12:20] and produced the first murder were one
[1:12:23] brother killed another
[1:12:25] and their son abel died and these were
[1:12:28] the first tears
[1:12:29] at a gravesite the first funeral
[1:12:32] the first separation this was the first
[1:12:35] of a long line of dying and death
[1:12:40] so in the garden of eden there were two
[1:12:41] trees one of them was a tree of life the
[1:12:44] other the tree of death
[1:12:46] or the tree of knowledge and then when
[1:12:48] man left the tree of life
[1:12:50] to eat from the tree of knowledge the
[1:12:51] first bite he took
[1:12:53] he separated himself from his maker
[1:12:56] and every time he bites on that tree of
[1:12:59] science and knowledge he kills himself
[1:13:01] and
[1:13:01] he just drives himself further away
[1:13:04] why don't he just simply come back to
[1:13:06] the tree the tree of life
[1:13:08] that's our only solution come back to
[1:13:11] the way that god
[1:13:13] made it at the first time but yet man is
[1:13:16] to his knowledge insist on trying to
[1:13:18] bring
[1:13:19] health and happiness and peace to man
[1:13:22] mankind that comes from a tree that has
[1:13:25] evil in it
[1:13:28] and with knowledge comes both good and
[1:13:31] evil so we try to help
[1:13:33] man with every medicine and it comes
[1:13:35] with its side effects
[1:13:37] we make travel with cars and trucks
[1:13:40] make life easier there but it comes with
[1:13:43] this poisonous gases that pollutes the
[1:13:45] air
[1:13:45] that we breathe in horrible accidents
[1:13:48] that leave so many broken hearts
[1:13:51] men broke bit off of the tree of
[1:13:53] knowledge
[1:13:54] and he bit off gunpowder and he kills
[1:13:57] his fellow man
[1:13:58] he bites off the tree of knowledge and
[1:14:01] he's made the nuclear bomb
[1:14:03] by which he threatens to end all life
[1:14:05] upon the earth
[1:14:07] but however there was another tree in
[1:14:09] the garden and it was not a tree
[1:14:11] of death but it was a tree of life
[1:14:15] and jesus came to us as the very fruit
[1:14:19] from the tree of life so he is
[1:14:22] he was life and the giver of life he
[1:14:25] said
[1:14:26] i am the bread of life that came from
[1:14:29] god
[1:14:29] out of heaven for he said he that
[1:14:32] believeth on me
[1:14:33] hath everlasting life i am that bread of
[1:14:36] life
[1:14:37] this is a bread which cometh down from
[1:14:39] heaven that if a man may eat thereof
[1:14:41] and will not die i am that living bread
[1:14:44] which came down from heaven
[1:14:46] if any man eat this bread he shall live
[1:14:48] forever
[1:14:49] and the bread which i will give is my
[1:14:51] flesh for i give for the life
[1:14:54] which i will give for the life of the
[1:14:56] world so as a man
[1:14:58] jesus would come to be one of us
[1:15:01] to fight human battles just like we
[1:15:03] fight he would face
[1:15:05] every trial and ever hurt that is known
[1:15:08] to man
[1:15:09] he came to bear the penalty of sin he
[1:15:12] did this
[1:15:13] in order to make a path back to life
[1:15:16] again
[1:15:18] and as the promised seed he like a corn
[1:15:21] of wheat
[1:15:22] was bruised and ground and made in the
[1:15:25] bread so that we could eat or partake
[1:15:27] of the fruit of the tree of life and
[1:15:29] live
[1:15:31] and jesus came to make the way for man
[1:15:33] to live eternally and
[1:15:34] he came back to make a life to
[1:15:38] make a life of heaven but when man
[1:15:41] brought
[1:15:42] sin to the earth and defiled his purity
[1:15:45] god didn't just give up on his creation
[1:15:48] he went immediately to work to bring
[1:15:50] reconciliation to man and
[1:15:52] all this time since the fall of man
[1:15:56] from life god has been working to bring
[1:16:00] heaven back down to man
[1:16:02] in the very same instance of the fall
[1:16:06] god revealed his plan that he would come
[1:16:08] of us as
[1:16:09] a seed the seed of the woman who would
[1:16:12] bruise the head of the serpent
[1:16:14] and would deliver man from the fear of
[1:16:16] death
[1:16:17] now it would be this clear path back to
[1:16:20] life and from death
[1:16:21] that jesus made available for all of us
[1:16:25] this is why jesus came to bring
[1:16:28] us back to the path of life for when man
[1:16:33] could not bring heaven upon the earth
[1:16:36] god came down the earth and brought
[1:16:38] heaven down
[1:16:40] and while upon the earth jesus showed
[1:16:42] his plan of reconciliation and
[1:16:44] everything that he did
[1:16:46] when he attended funerals he raised the
[1:16:49] dead
[1:16:50] he opened the eyes of the blind to show
[1:16:53] he restores sight
[1:16:55] he healed the leper to show he is lord
[1:16:57] over the most
[1:16:58] dreaded diseases and as a man
[1:17:02] he would face every trial ever hurt
[1:17:04] known
[1:17:05] you see he came to make everything good
[1:17:08] again
[1:17:09] so he is not the bringer of death he is
[1:17:12] the giver of
[1:17:13] life and jesus came to bear
[1:17:16] the penalty of sin and he did this to
[1:17:19] make
[1:17:19] this pathway back to heaven where he
[1:17:22] could say i am the way
[1:17:24] the truth and the life and no one can
[1:17:27] come back and be reconciled with god
[1:17:29] except by me so he came back
[1:17:32] to make a way for man to live eternally
[1:17:36] came to
[1:17:37] make the way back to life a life of
[1:17:39] heaven
[1:17:40] and so it's this clear path to life from
[1:17:43] death that jesus
[1:17:44] made and is available to us all
[1:17:49] to everyone who will accept his grace
[1:17:51] and his pardon
[1:17:54] and even in this difficult hour he
[1:17:57] offers that grace and love and mercy
[1:18:01] and i know this is a difficult time and
[1:18:03] a dark hour for many
[1:18:05] i can think of job when
[1:18:09] as the bible gives him as an example of
[1:18:11] a man
[1:18:12] who the extreme happened to him
[1:18:16] probably no one has ever suffered as he
[1:18:19] did
[1:18:19] in the calamities of life where he would
[1:18:22] experience
[1:18:23] loss of wealth loss of children loss of
[1:18:25] health
[1:18:26] loss of respect
[1:18:29] many horrible and tragic events happened
[1:18:31] to job
[1:18:32] and it was much of it was all on the
[1:18:34] same day
[1:18:36] it tested the limits of his human
[1:18:38] strength
[1:18:40] but i want you to remember what job did
[1:18:43] job arose and he rent his mantle he
[1:18:46] shaved his head
[1:18:47] and he fell down on the ground and he
[1:18:49] worshipped
[1:18:52] and then the bible said he worshipped he
[1:18:54] blessed the name of the lord he
[1:18:56] looked right at the calamity and instead
[1:19:00] of blaming god
[1:19:02] instead of questioning the lord he
[1:19:05] worshipped
[1:19:06] and in all of this job sent not nor
[1:19:09] charged
[1:19:10] god foolishly you see
[1:19:13] he didn't choose charge god with
[1:19:15] wrongdoing or
[1:19:16] and speak against god or he didn't
[1:19:19] entertain
[1:19:20] dishonorable thoughts of god as as if
[1:19:23] god had done
[1:19:24] something unworthy of his infinite
[1:19:26] wisdom or justice
[1:19:28] or goodness
[1:19:31] he worshipped this is what we do as
[1:19:34] believers
[1:19:36] in moments like these in our hardest
[1:19:39] trials
[1:19:40] in our greatest test it calls for us
[1:19:43] to worship god to fall on our knees
[1:19:46] and say lord your god over all
[1:19:50] and you're my god and you understand
[1:19:53] things
[1:19:53] that i could never comprehend that one
[1:19:56] day
[1:19:57] as a song was beautifully saying we'll
[1:19:59] talk it over
[1:20:01] and you'll wipe out all tears away from
[1:20:03] our eyes
[1:20:04] and we'll have perfect understanding as
[1:20:07] you understand
[1:20:10] these dark moments there's been many of
[1:20:12] them
[1:20:13] i think of a thief on the cross he was
[1:20:16] guilty
[1:20:17] he was dying but it wasn't too late for
[1:20:21] in that
[1:20:22] moment he turned and looked upon jesus
[1:20:25] in his very last moments of life and
[1:20:28] said
[1:20:29] remember me
[1:20:32] and he heard these words back to him
[1:20:35] this day
[1:20:36] you that will be with me in paradise
[1:20:41] you know we don't know a person's last
[1:20:43] moments
[1:20:44] it is never our job to
[1:20:48] decide someone's destiny
[1:20:51] because jesus said in john 5 22 that the
[1:20:54] father judgeth no man but he's committed
[1:20:57] all judgment unto the son
[1:21:00] so if the father committed all judgment
[1:21:03] to the son then
[1:21:04] what do we have to do today but to give
[1:21:07] our loved one over to jesus
[1:21:09] and i want to ask you who is more
[1:21:11] compassionate than jesus
[1:21:14] when he could turn to a thief and rather
[1:21:16] than giving him a scolding
[1:21:18] for his behavior in life and his
[1:21:20] misdeeds that he'd done
[1:21:23] and the horrible deeds that he has
[1:21:26] committed rather than condemning him as
[1:21:28] others had done
[1:21:30] he pardoned him this is why we can trust
[1:21:34] in the lord with all our
[1:21:35] heart and instead of leaning on our own
[1:21:38] understanding because
[1:21:40] in truth we don't understand
[1:21:43] and we don't know the heart of man
[1:21:46] and we don't know a man's or woman's
[1:21:49] last
[1:21:50] moments
[1:21:54] so instead of trying to understand then
[1:21:56] let's trust
[1:21:58] we trust in the lord with all our heart
[1:22:00] we then allow him to direct us to a path
[1:22:03] of healing to righteousness and to
[1:22:06] living our lives
[1:22:08] for others as that's what real
[1:22:10] christianity is
[1:22:13] when we hear of some of the heartaches
[1:22:16] in the bible in the dark hours there
[1:22:18] we remember the friend of jesus lazarus
[1:22:21] had died and
[1:22:22] his sisters martha and mary came to him
[1:22:27] and and of course you know their their
[1:22:30] grief was great
[1:22:33] and when martha had heard that jesus had
[1:22:36] come
[1:22:37] he said she said these words to
[1:22:40] to to mary the master has come
[1:22:45] and he calleth for thee and you may
[1:22:48] feel that today is a very dark hour but
[1:22:51] let me tell you the master has come
[1:22:54] and he calls he calls for you that he
[1:22:58] to give you comfort to give you strength
[1:23:01] and you must allow him
[1:23:02] to give you that comfort as blind
[1:23:05] bartimaeus
[1:23:06] whose cry stopped the master you must
[1:23:08] call out to him
[1:23:10] for the bible said he that calls on the
[1:23:12] name of the lord
[1:23:13] shall be saved this moment
[1:23:18] is a moment when our hearts are tendered
[1:23:21] when we can look upon the frailty of our
[1:23:24] humanity
[1:23:27] and he offers mercy and grace
[1:23:30] and you must take it he comes to heal
[1:23:33] the wounded and the brokenhearted
[1:23:35] and let me just say don't allow the
[1:23:37] hurts and the wounds that you have
[1:23:39] received in life
[1:23:40] become the chains upon your spirit and
[1:23:44] imprison you don't allow your grief to
[1:23:47] turn you into
[1:23:48] a bitter person but rather let the
[1:23:50] healer
[1:23:52] heal your wounded in your broken spirit
[1:23:55] and bring his joy into your life
[1:23:59] the master comes and calls for you what
[1:24:02] to restore you to give you strength for
[1:24:05] this hour
[1:24:06] for he is the one who has the power to
[1:24:09] bring
[1:24:09] life out of death god
[1:24:12] wastes no opportunity he is the healer
[1:24:17] he can take a life that is ridden with
[1:24:19] the disease of sin
[1:24:21] and rid that life of sin he can take a
[1:24:24] life
[1:24:25] that is dead and sins trespasses and
[1:24:27] free them from the bondage
[1:24:29] and the chains because he is the chain
[1:24:31] breaker
[1:24:33] he is able to break the chains of
[1:24:34] alcohol and drugs and immorality and
[1:24:37] free you from the bondage that will hold
[1:24:40] you down
[1:24:41] and yeah he can even cause dry bones to
[1:24:44] live again
[1:24:46] the prophet isaiah would see the
[1:24:48] redeemer coming and he would say of him
[1:24:50] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[1:24:53] because the lord hath anointed me to
[1:24:55] preach good tidings to the me he has
[1:24:58] sent me to break
[1:24:59] bind up the brokenhearted and proclaim
[1:25:01] liberty
[1:25:02] to the captive and the opening of the
[1:25:04] prison to them that are bound
[1:25:07] and to proclaim the acceptable year of
[1:25:09] the lord and the day of vengeance of our
[1:25:11] god and to comfort
[1:25:12] all that mourn to appoint to them that
[1:25:15] mourn
[1:25:16] in zion to give them beauty for ashes
[1:25:19] the oil of joy for mourning
[1:25:22] the pre the garment of praise for the
[1:25:24] spirit of heavens that they might be
[1:25:26] called the trees of righteousness
[1:25:28] the planting of the lord that he might
[1:25:29] be glorified
[1:25:31] this bible tells us that today is the
[1:25:34] day of mercy it's the year
[1:25:36] of god's favor and today we are anointed
[1:25:41] to declare good tidings that there is
[1:25:43] one present
[1:25:45] to heal the brokenhearted to set at
[1:25:47] liberty those that are bound to comfort
[1:25:49] all that mourn
[1:25:50] to give beauty for ashes to give the joy
[1:25:53] doyle of joy for those that mourn and
[1:25:55] to lighten the load by removing the
[1:25:59] spirit of heaviness
[1:26:01] and exchanging it for garment of praise
[1:26:05] you may ask well how can i
[1:26:09] have joy and praise in a moment like
[1:26:11] this
[1:26:12] well i can praise him because he's a god
[1:26:15] that's a god of love
[1:26:17] i can praise him that he's a god of
[1:26:18] mercy
[1:26:20] i can praise him that he's a god of
[1:26:22] truth and a god of deliverance
[1:26:24] and he's a god that can change and turn
[1:26:27] life
[1:26:28] or death into life and sadness into joy
[1:26:31] and
[1:26:31] sickness into health
[1:26:35] yeah without a doubt there's a coming
[1:26:38] the day of judgment
[1:26:40] but that's not today we're not here
[1:26:42] today
[1:26:44] to judge the life of another we're here
[1:26:46] to consider our own way
[1:26:48] to consider our path where are we in
[1:26:52] this life's
[1:26:52] journey and where do we go from here
[1:26:57] nathan precedes us as he leaves life's
[1:27:00] journey
[1:27:02] i felt like at 43 years old he checked
[1:27:05] out a little too soon
[1:27:08] but he leads the way and he says
[1:27:12] that all of us must leave this life
[1:27:17] nathan's sudden death forces us to
[1:27:20] realize our own humanity
[1:27:23] he left us way too quickly he but he'll
[1:27:26] never leave our hearts
[1:27:28] and the hearts of his mother or his
[1:27:30] sisters
[1:27:32] you'll never leave our memories there'll
[1:27:35] always be a love and a special
[1:27:36] place in our heart for the young man
[1:27:38] that we knew
[1:27:40] but looking up on this crowd today
[1:27:43] the many who are gathered here and i
[1:27:46] want to thank you for coming and
[1:27:47] supporting the family at this time
[1:27:49] and all of you that are here and showing
[1:27:52] your love
[1:27:53] at this moment
[1:27:56] but we're here because we're shocked
[1:28:00] we're shocked at how sudden our life can
[1:28:03] come to an
[1:28:04] end here in this world and it forces us
[1:28:08] to have to face the fact that we're
[1:28:12] mortal
[1:28:13] but while we're considering our
[1:28:15] mortality we should also consider
[1:28:18] that through jesus we can experience
[1:28:22] immortality eternal life
[1:28:26] as far as this life because of the fall
[1:28:28] of mankind
[1:28:30] into sin we each one of us
[1:28:33] have a terminal disease
[1:28:37] and that disease is called mortality
[1:28:42] the current death rate is 100
[1:28:47] unless jesus comes soon we're all going
[1:28:50] to die
[1:28:52] we don't like to think about it but
[1:28:54] nathan forces us today to think about
[1:28:56] our own
[1:28:57] mortality you know this means that
[1:29:01] worldwide three people die every second
[1:29:04] 180 die every minute nearly 11 000
[1:29:08] every hour and since the bible is right
[1:29:11] about what happens to us after death
[1:29:14] it means that more than 250 000 people
[1:29:17] every day either go to heaven
[1:29:20] or they're reserved to the judgment and
[1:29:23] life
[1:29:24] is short it is short whether we are 43
[1:29:29] as nathan was or whether we're 99
[1:29:33] life is but a vapor
[1:29:36] james would say you don't know the least
[1:29:40] thing about what may happen tomorrow
[1:29:42] and what is the nature of your life
[1:29:46] you are really but a wisp of vapor a
[1:29:48] puff of smoke a mist
[1:29:50] that is visible for a little while and
[1:29:53] then
[1:29:54] disappears as it went into thin air
[1:29:58] the book of psalms says you have made my
[1:30:01] days a mere
[1:30:02] hand breath the span of my years there's
[1:30:04] nothing before you
[1:30:06] each man's life is but a breath
[1:30:11] again in the book of psalms it says
[1:30:13] remember how short my life
[1:30:15] is how empty and futile this human
[1:30:18] existence
[1:30:20] no one can live forever all will die
[1:30:23] no one can escape the power of the grave
[1:30:27] and the frailty of our life reminds us
[1:30:31] that life passes by
[1:30:34] all too quickly and since you can't go
[1:30:38] back
[1:30:38] and delete what you don't like about
[1:30:40] your life
[1:30:41] or rewind your life so you can live it
[1:30:44] differently
[1:30:45] the best you can do from this moment on
[1:30:48] is to make every day count so you start
[1:30:52] today
[1:30:53] knowing that each moment slips quickly
[1:30:56] into the past and that should inspire us
[1:30:59] to make the most of out of every second
[1:31:03] limiting regrets and should haves and
[1:31:07] could haves and woodhouse
[1:31:09] gives me courage to get the best of
[1:31:12] every day
[1:31:14] so begin today begin today to love
[1:31:17] goodness
[1:31:18] goodness gracious we got enough hate in
[1:31:20] the world
[1:31:23] but you can't love without forgiveness
[1:31:26] so start forgiving
[1:31:28] you cannot take drudges and bitterness
[1:31:30] and other expressions of hate to heaven
[1:31:33] but your anger and bitterness and
[1:31:35] grudges and hate
[1:31:37] can separate you from god forever
[1:31:41] the life and the power of this gospel
[1:31:44] makes it possible
[1:31:45] to love your enemies and to do good to
[1:31:47] them that despitefully
[1:31:49] uses you as william branham said
[1:31:54] hatred had a beginning so it has to have
[1:31:57] an end
[1:31:58] love has no beginning so it has no end
[1:32:03] hatred is forever love is eternal
[1:32:06] hatred begins and hatred will end
[1:32:09] love never did begin and it will never
[1:32:12] end see it's eternal
[1:32:16] so today we are reminded
[1:32:20] that life here is too short to hold on
[1:32:23] to things that separate us
[1:32:25] there will not be walls that will
[1:32:27] separate us in heaven
[1:32:30] so tell me why should we build up walls
[1:32:32] that separate us here on the earth
[1:32:36] heaven extends its borders to include
[1:32:39] others for the gates of heaven are open
[1:32:42] day and night but hell is walled and
[1:32:45] enclosed
[1:32:48] you know we need to stop and to realize
[1:32:52] that this all-too-brief life of
[1:32:55] nathan really screams screams out today
[1:33:00] that says tear down the walls that
[1:33:03] divide us
[1:33:04] for though heaven has walls and the
[1:33:08] gates are always open
[1:33:10] even so let us spread a little heaven
[1:33:13] down here on the earth
[1:33:16] and may god open our hearts with love
[1:33:18] and kindness and compassion
[1:33:20] as paul would say be kind to one another
[1:33:23] tenderhearted
[1:33:24] forgiving one another for as even as
[1:33:28] christ
[1:33:29] god for christ's sake hath forgiven you
[1:33:31] these are the trademarks
[1:33:33] of a christian life compassion
[1:33:36] sympathetic
[1:33:37] pity and concern for the misfortunes of
[1:33:40] others
[1:33:43] as we come down to the end today
[1:33:48] we're to show mercy to reach out a
[1:33:50] helping hand
[1:33:52] make every moment count because we're
[1:33:55] here
[1:33:55] because life is but a short moment
[1:33:59] but there is an eternity and life does
[1:34:03] not have to come to an end
[1:34:07] because there is an eternal life offered
[1:34:10] us
[1:34:10] all and finally today
[1:34:14] we want to submit to god's will
[1:34:18] the book of john first john said the
[1:34:20] world and his desires passes away but
[1:34:22] the man who
[1:34:24] does the will of god lives forever
[1:34:28] so today let's put nathan into the hands
[1:34:31] of jesus
[1:34:32] today let us put our lives into the
[1:34:35] hands
[1:34:36] of jesus and as we have sung the songs
[1:34:39] today
[1:34:40] of the power that will break every chain
[1:34:43] let him break the chains of our grief
[1:34:46] and our sorrows and release to us the
[1:34:48] joy of the lord
[1:34:50] for truly the joy of the lord is our
[1:34:52] strength
[1:34:54] and also i want to say to you today
[1:34:57] if you have chains of sin of addictions
[1:35:00] or chains of hate or
[1:35:01] anger or unforgiveness in this moment
[1:35:06] turn to god who's the chain breaker
[1:35:08] trust in the lord with all your heart
[1:35:10] and lean not to your own understanding
[1:35:13] and then in all your ways acknowledge
[1:35:15] him
[1:35:16] so he will direct your path
[1:35:21] we're going to have prayer at this
[1:35:22] moment and as we just bow our heads
[1:35:26] just a moment let us not waste an
[1:35:29] opportunity here
[1:35:33] would there be one here in this place
[1:35:35] that would just like to lift a hand to
[1:35:36] god and say lord
[1:35:38] let me acknowledge you today
[1:35:42] where i quit leaning on my own
[1:35:44] understanding
[1:35:46] so that in all my ways you can direct my
[1:35:49] path
[1:35:50] i need your leadership today will you
[1:35:52] give me that guidance
[1:35:54] god bless you as you raise a hand toward
[1:35:56] him
[1:35:58] father we bless your name today
[1:36:02] we want to thank you lord for the
[1:36:05] blessings of life
[1:36:07] upon us for the grace that has been
[1:36:09] given us
[1:36:11] yes lord and we thank you for nathan we
[1:36:14] hear of the tributes that were paid to
[1:36:16] him today
[1:36:17] the memories of his childhood the
[1:36:20] memories of his service to our country
[1:36:22] the men who have come to support the
[1:36:26] family and to honor him at this moment
[1:36:28] this time the church
[1:36:29] evening like tabernacle has gathered as
[1:36:32] a body
[1:36:32] and the friends and the host of friends
[1:36:35] that have come
[1:36:36] and they're here today lord you extend
[1:36:39] a hand of mercy and grace and love and
[1:36:42] compassion
[1:36:43] and lord we just pray that you'll

[1:36:48] in your great arms of compassion and
[1:36:51] love today

[1:36:54] they need in this hour

[1:37:11] and father may we reflect on you
[1:37:14] throughout this day and may this
[1:37:16] life not be a wasted life because it
