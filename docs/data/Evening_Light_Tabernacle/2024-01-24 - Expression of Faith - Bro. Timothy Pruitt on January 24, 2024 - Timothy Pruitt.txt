amen I know many of us came under great expectation tonight and I believe he's here to meet us meet each one of our needs going to ask brother Tim if he'd come open the Service in prayer and amen as he comes want to remember to pray for brother Jonathan Middleton tonight he's sick and ask for prayer also remember Sister Margaret Coleman as well as Sister Barbara Whistler they're both in a care facility both of them very frail and fragile condition amen but I know the Lord knows their heart I know they would love to be here tonight amen let's just pray that the Lord would surround them where they are and any others that are shut in tonight sick tonight maybe streaming at home and their heart's desire is to be here I believe God can meet that desire if you have a need you want to lift to the Lord as brother Tim comes let's go to him in prayer praise the Lord and good to be in the house of the Lord tonight I want to say thank you for praying for me while I was away and um was just come back home from brother Ron Spencer's and um you know I I did something that um that was reminiscent to me of what happened with brother Kenneth Middleton some years back he had got a report from a doctor that there was nothing more they could do for him no more operations no more stance no more no more anything that it was end of life and they couldn't help him anymore and he was there in the hospital and in uh pretty Dar streets at that moment in time and I was praying about it in the morning and ask the Lord God you're going to have to do something you're going to have to do something I mean doctors can't do anything more and if you don't do something he's going to die and so Lord I you know we're we're at a that moment you're going to have to move and God spoke back to me so clearly said I've already done my part you go do yours I went and laid hands on him and prayed for him he lived three or four more years after that God extended his life and you know when we speak about brother Ron I just want you to understand you know the doctors have given a new report on him they found cancer in both eyes that they believe is coming from somewhere in his perhaps from his brain and and maybe something active there there's further tests that are coming and so on like that but you know while I was there he walked two miles on a treadmill while I was there we had a great great time fellowshipping and and enjoying one another's company brother Donnie Reagan as you know came over and and encouraged him and helped him too and it was really good that I went because no sooner then I got there he got a phone call telling him about his situation and so I was right there with him during those times to just try to give him comfort and consolation just a buddy to be with him and um God willing they're going to mark off something on their bucket list they're going to do this this next weekend and go away for a cruise and I think he plans to preach Saturday night and then leave Sunday morning to to go away for little Cru so you know he is he's continuing to fight the fight of faith and believe the Word of Promise he's continuing to put faith into action and that's what we have to do in these times we just can't lay down and quit amen we're looking for the miraculous and I I believe God is moving I believe he's moving around the world I believe that prayers are being answered in fact the matter is while the mass prayer went forth um they took brother Ron's little granddaughter Zoe back to the to the allergist because of a whole list of problems that she was having and he declared her allergy free it wasn't even a need for it we heard from others that wrote in said brother Tim uh you know as you prayed as you prayed there I was listening on the internet and God healed me of a generational curse that had been on my life and brought her Deliverance so I believe there were many many things that was done I believe God's doing some things and I believe he wants to do something for us tonight brother Aaron and sister Lydia are going over to North Carolina so they've left already traveling that way for meetings this weekend let's keep them in prayer as the ministry team will be going different places being used of God and I tell you there is no limit to what God will do let's believe him tonight with all our hearts will you believe with me as we go to prayer father in the name of Jesus we bring to you these requests of Jonathan Lord in his need and his family that situation there thou knowest we bring to you the shuin Lord that I visited this this week of Sister Barbara Whistler and oh god of Sister Margaret Coleman Sister Margaret on hospice maybe 80 lbs Lord maybe not much longer to live but oh it was just refreshing to have a little visitation and I just pray Lord that you'll Comfort them in this hour but do more than Comfort I pray that you'll bring a Deliverance in the way that only you know how to bring as you want want want us to live in these bodies of humiliation forever but you rescue us from them and I pray Lord that you would do as you do best and as you know best Lord there was hands went across this congregation raised to you and you know their needs and I pray that you would Minister to each one of them tonight Lord you know the speaker that you have chosen for tonight and the message that you have placed on his heart I ask that he'd have free Liberty I ask Lord you'll be with our ministry team as they will be going different places brother eron sister Lydia now uh already have left um for the weekend I

this place Lord and feel your presence here today Father what a blessing it is to be with you Lord and be with your people we ask Lord that you would come and move and touch hearts and lives and Minister Lord as only you can do we ask God you give us strength strength in this hour to stand and Lord when we done all to stand that we stand therefore Lord just giving you glory and giving you praise for all that you have done we praise you in Jesus name amen amen God bless you tonight let's turn to Romans chapter 4 and verse 19 amen don't think I think it's coincidence that we sang that song right there at the end as I was s just bowing my head to pray and caught what's highlighted here in the scripture I just had to say wow amen Romans 4: 19 and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb and he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in the faith giving glory to God to God be the glory giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was also able to perform amen God bless you you can be seated amen I just want to thank you for your prayers for me while I was away and and also since I've been back um I'll I'll maybe show some things things on Sunday of the trip I was going to do it tonight but for time's sake we'll wait till Sunday maybe to show a little bit there and uh but God did some wonderful things and some great things we we'll say we had about 450 or so 500 young people and and elders and different ones pastors that that gathered together and and came together there in Uganda and and God moved very wonderfully and very Mighty mightily and we thank him there's so many testimoni and things that are coming from those meetings and a lot of strength that came from them and they're giving all the glory unto God and and so then we come back of course sick in our body we actually started feeling some things as we were leaving there and you know they just eat different food and drink different things and as far as their water stuff in it things like that try to stay away from different things as much as you can but but uh it still gets to you somehow maybe it comes through your skin I don't know how it gets to you but anyway you got sick in your your body and so Saturday we was just really really sick and and then Sunday it just turned right around and my we sure enjoyed even though we'd Lov to have been here we sure enjoyed the service that we heard that that God came down and moved Among Us and amen I I believe there is power in the atmosphere amen and I I believe we need to fight for the right atmosphere in every service Amen to go that God can have the glory and the honor and uh actually uh I'd like to speak tonight on on the expression of Faith the expression of faith and I I just want to read the scripture again and Abra speaking of Abraham and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb but he staggered not at the promises of God through unbelief but was strong in the faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he promised he was able also to perform you know as Believers we start out in faith believe in God's promise but we don't want to just start in faith but we want to stay in faith amen but we must stay in faith and stand in faith until the answer is manifested you know Abraham believed God's promise and stayed there until it manifested it wasn't easy it wasn't quick you know it took 25 years or more or so around there it was a battle but while he waited he glorified God Amen while he waited he praised him and thanked him as if it was already done he praised God for the promise instead of just praising God for the progress amen so many times we want to praise him when we see progress you know we see a a better doctor's report or we see uh the symptoms going away or we then we can want to praise God but God Abraham did not praise God for the progress he didn't see any progress 25 years later there was no progress as we read there was still the deadness of his own body and the deadness of Sarah's womb but amen he praised God Amen for the promise and that's what we as Believers have to do we we're not looking at progress and whether it's happening or whether it isn't happening whether it's getting better or it isn't getting better whether symptoms are leaving or they're not leaving amen I'm not looking at that that's not why I'm praising God I'm praising God cuz he gave the promise and he's able to perform that which he says amen amen we you know we see a change in a in a situation and then we'll praise him but AB Abraham didn't consider what he saw he what he saw was the deadness of Sarah's womb what he saw was his own failures and his own mistakes what he saw was his own body getting older day by day but he continued to give God glory and he maintained or expressed that Faith by by Praise amen that praise amen not not not not speaking of his circumstances or speaking of his issues or or speaking of the situation around him now we can go through hundreds of quotes brother brandham used Abraham many times in in his in his ministry of how he would come to Sarah and he said do you feel any different well praise God it doesn't matter anyhow to be a big bigger miracle today that it was yesterday amen what was he doing he was not praising amen the progress or what was happening there in his sight or what he could see but he was going back to what God had spoke and what God had promised and I believe that's somewhere we can stand here tonight that that no matter what we see or what's going on around us this bride now is 2,000 years old and seem like things are going a little bit further a little bit longer than we expected but that doesn't matter amen what matters is God made the promise that he wouldn't leave us that he wouldn't forsake us that he would change our bodies amen God made that promise therefore we can praise the promise and not the progress amen you know Philippians 4 said rejoice in the lord always amen you know I like the way it says that it says rejoice in the lord always it doesn't say rejoice in the Lord when things are going good and when amen the progress report is right and the doctor's report is right and everything's Rosy and everything's great it says rejoice in the lord always in another words take pleasure in him Delight in him and again I say rejoice the same word is in Psalms 37 and ver4 we're going to go through quite a few scriptures tonight delight yourself in the Lord and He will give you the desires or the petitions of your heart so as you praise him God will give amen the Praises go up and the glory comes down amen the Praises amen leaves your lips and many times you don't feel like praising him but that doesn't matter many many times you don't act like things around you the circumstances are are not circumstances that that that you know would would make you want to praise or make you want to uh thank God or make you want to give all you got but that doesn't matter amen what matters is you praise Him anyhow and you lift your voice and and you give him glory and you give him honor Amen in verse 5 in Philippians 4 it says let your Gentle Spirit be known into all people for the Lord is near don't be anxious or worried about anything but in everything and by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving amen not just prayer but prayer with Thanksgiving amen not just asking but saying God you're great not just asking to be healed but saying God I want to thank you for my healing not just asking that your child will come home but I want to thank you that they're on their way I may not see the progress I might not see things moving it doesn't matter what matters is you gave me the promise and I'm going to praise the promise amen the and said continue to make your request known unto God and then the peace of God Amen was transcends all understanding that peace which stands guard over your heart and your mind in Christ Jesus it is yours amen he said in John 14 verse 27 the peace that I Leave You my perfect peace I give unto you not as the world gives do I give it to you let not your heart be troubled nor Let It Be Afraid let my perfect peace calm you in every circumstance Hallelujah and if you want this peace then you got to praise Him hallelujah amen because you can Praise Him it doesn't matter what a doctor says it doesn't matter what somebody else says it doesn't matter what your own mind says it doesn't matter what's going on around you you can praise him and have peace there's peace that'll guard your heart and and and and make a Garrison around it amen will calm you in every circumstance and this peace will encourage you and strengthen you for every challenge I want to go through some Amplified and they can follow if they they want to in Proverbs 14 and verse 26 it says in the reverent and worshipful fear of the Lord there is a strong confidence Hallelujah in the reverent and worshipful worshipful fear of the Lord there is a strong confidence and his children shall always have a place of Refuge Hallelujah that no matter what you're facing you're still in the Refuge no matter what you're going through you're still at peace no matter what it's happen cuz this peace is not a peace that the world gives cuz if it's a peace that the world gives then the world can take it away amen the world gives you peace by offering a peaceful climate or offering a peaceful Nations and and we're not at war no more that can be just that can last just so long amen but what happens when the world gives peace the world can also take away peace but if God gives you peace then the world can't take it away so it doesn't matter what's going on around you or all the issues or the trouble you can still be at peace there can be a refuge you can go into in the time of trouble right oh and another one in Psalms 108 verse1 he says oh God my heart is fixed in other words it's steadfast in the confidence of faith I will sing yes I will give Praises even with my glory all the faculties and powers of the one created in your in in your image so again it's the faith and Praises are mixed together they're tied together amen praises and Faith are tied together the UN Psalms 64 and10 the uncompromisingly righteous shall be glad in the Lord and shall trust and take refuge in him and all the upright in heart shall glory and offer praise in other words the righteous the faithful shall be glad in the Lord and shall trust in him and offer up praise in Psalms 40 and verse three and he hath put a new song in my mouth it is a song of praise to our God many shall see and fear and put their trust and confidence and Reliance in the Lord that's right Hallelujah in Psalms 5 and verse 11 let all those who take refuge and put their trust in you rejoice let them ever sing and shout for Joy because you make a covering over them and defend them let those who love your name be joyful in you and be in High Spirits maybe I need to read that one more time hang on just a minute Hallelujah let those who take refuge and put their trust Faith their trust their faith in you rejoice let them ever sing and shout for Joy because you make a covering over them and defend them Hallelujah and you defend them let those also who love your name be joyful in you and be in high my [Applause] spirits cuz the spirit that we have received is not of this world therefore is not dictated by what this world says or what this world does or the atmosphere this world has this Spirit comes from above Hallelujah therefore you can be in High Spirits in hard times you can rejoice in the hardest of the difficult of circumstances when you don't know if it's going to get any B better it does not matter I'm going to praise His promise I'm going to praise His word I'm going to praise a god who's not just able but more than able to fulfill his [Applause] word Psalms 56 and verse 3 and 4 says the time when I am afraid I will have confidence and put my trust and Reliance of You In You by the help of God I will praise His word Hallelujah by the help of God I will praise his word on God I lean and rely and confid confidently put my trust I will not fear for what can man or who is flesh who is flesh that can do unto me and and in Psalm 71 and 5-8 says For You Are My Hope Oh Lord God you are my trust from my youth and the source of my confidence upon you have I learned and relied from birth you are he who took me from my mother's womb and you have been my benefactor from that day my praise is continually of you I am as a wonder and surprise to many but you are my strong Refuge my mouth shall be filled with your praises and your honor all the day Hallelujah now I want to go to to a very famous scripture and one I think is very ought to be one that's I guess I don't know how to say it but to the bride one that she takes heart in because it's the Rapture scripture where brother Brandon pulled the Rapture from psalms 27 and verse one the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear come on somebody sugar diabetes cancer Devils who Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is my strength of Life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foe came to eat my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War shall rise against me in this will I be confident so don't sound like a good day for David he's got Wars he's got enemies he's got things that's trying to make him fear but you can still say I'm going to stand I'm going to be confident I will not fear cuz one thing I have desired of the Lord and I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he'll hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle he shall hide me and he'll set me upon a rock and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies roundabout therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing and I will sing praises unto the Lord so right there with the confidence and the won fear and I'm going to stand and he's put me on a rock I'm going to offer a sacrifice of Joy did you catch that a sacrifice of Joy just because you made it to his Tabernacle doesn't mean it's going to be easy to offer up a praise but you have to sacrifice something you have to sacrifice your pride you got to sacrifice what you think you got to sacrifice your time you got to sacrifice tomorrow or maybe the next day and all that let it all go I'm going to praise God cuz I have been brought to this place the devil's tried to kill me a host is encamped about me but God is for me who can be against me hallelujah it's a sacrifice of praise it's a sacrifice of Joy thank you what does a priest do brother BR said he said makes a sacrifice it's a spiritual sacrifice that's what Sons and Daughters do which are Kings and Priests they're making sacrifices offering to God spiritual sacrifice the fruit of our lips giving praise to to him you say well I don't feel like praising that's the time to make the sacrifice that's awesome it ain't a sacrifice unless it's a sacrifice I don't mean to make it stupid simple but that's exactly what it is it ain't a sacrifice unless it's a sacrifice and listen you come on a Wednesday night that's a sacrifice but don't just come into His Temple and just sit here and twidle your thumb but say God I want to give you praise because I'm still here the devil's been after me all week and he's tried to torment my mind he tried to come against my body he's come against my family and he's done this and that and I've been encamped about but God I'm going to offer you up a sacrifice of praise I'm going to glorify you cuz you are greater than what's against me you are greater than what is trying to come and attack me I am going to praise you no matter what cuz your word is still true your word is still true and it will not fall to the ground but it will be fulfilled so no matter what I'm going through I'll still praise him if I'm up or if I'm down if my problem's solved or if it's worse that matters not I'm going to praise him I will sing praises un God for he inhabits the Praises of his people hallah yes you know I got to studying on that today that literally means he en he is enthroned in the Praises you want to build your king of Throne start praising him [Music] yes so if that builds him a throne what does your doubts and frustrations and moaning and grown and what Throne does it build for come on now amen l literally it means he's enthroned in the Praises of his people your praise builds a throne for him to rule on your praise makes a seat of Authority for God to sit on and send out decrees against your enemy come on people of God your praise makes a seat where the king can come down and declare war against your enemy that's Waring against you your praise make it's a place angels can go to work and destroy the enemy that's trying to destroy you but I want to see something before I pray no that ain't that ain't true sacrifice of praise that's a reaction to what's already happened but what about praising him before you ever get the action what about glorifying him with a sacrifice amen build him a throne build him a place to operate from build him a place to send decrees from and and destroy your enemy Psalms 106 verse1 Israel had to be taught to praise God before they saw the answer if isra to be taught that we got to be taught that Psalms 106 and verse1 praise ye the Lord oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good how many can say amen for his mercy endureth forever who can who can utterly utter the mighty acts of the Lord who can show forth all his praise I'll just listen to that wonderful song on the podcast the half hasn't been told we can stand here for hours with testimonies and I can tell you even what I even know from what happened in ugand and half still hasn't been told this God is a great God he's greater than our Humanity he's greater than our human thinking and we think sometimes that where is the Miracles where God's doing them all over the place it's only going to be on the other side that we truly see Amen in the back back parts and the things behind the scene and what was going on and how Angels were moving and Angels were touching and Angels were delivering and God was moving when we didn't even realize it amen as that song says even when I don't see you I know you're working cuz you promised it that's his [Applause] promise blessed are they that keep judgment and he that does righteous at all times remember me oh Lord with favor for thou bearest un thy people visit me with thy salvation that I may see the good of thy chosen yeah that's a good thing Lord I want to see the good of thy chosen that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation that I may Glory With Thine inheritance we have sinned with our fathers we have committed iniquity we have done wickedly our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies but provoked him at the Red Sea yeah even at the Red Sea nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake that he might make his mighty power be known he rebuked the Red Sea also and it was dried up so he led them through the as through the Wilderness and he saved them from the hand of him that hated him and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy and the waters covered their enemies and there was not one of them then then believe they his words and they sang his Praises when they saw the dead Egyptians I know we love to use that story it's a powerful story of maram picking up the tambourine and I believe when we see our enemies that dead we ought to Rejoice but we don't have to wait to see them dead before we do Rejoice amen I believe what happened why was the tambourine before the Red Sea it ought have been playing and saying thank you God you saved me from being a slave you bringing me to a Promised Land it doesn't matter what's in my way you'll make a way where there seems to be no way but they turn to their and if they would have kept that praise they would have built a throne and the Red Sea would have opened but they built they took him off the throne and they put their groanings and their moanings and their upsets and their frustrations and all of that and God said what what are you doing well wasn't there any Graves that we could be buried in Egypt how quickly they forgot let's don't be that kind of people we're hear so you got to war against that cuz we tend to forget very quickly what God has done because why why does Satan try to cover that up because he knows what God has done God will do amen and so he he wants you to he don't want you to remember all those things because if you remember it as shamgar did and different ones down there they remembered hey I'm a son of son of Abraham Isaac and Jacob their God is my God he moved on their behalf he'll move on my behalf amen he doesn't want you to see or remember what God has done cuz he knows what God done he does amen and when he does it he's powerless before him oh Hallelujah but the Red Sea open and they picked it up and then when they saw all these things then they begin to praise him oh it's easy it's easy to praise him when you get a clean doctor's report come on now but what about praising them before you do it's easy to praise him oh look my son's come back look at him he's serving God but what about praising him before they [Applause] do come on somebody it's easy to praise God when the fever's left and the stomach feels better and things are happen it's easy to do that but what about before they do amen God wants your praise before you see the Promise fulfilled that is a real sacrifice cuz you're sacrificing your own human thoughts what will people think how what would if it don't happen it ain't up to me to make it happen it's up to God to fulfill his word and I what it's up to me is to praise him until he [Applause] does they had to see at first to believe right before this great Victory they were complaining and crying crying and moaning and cursing God but when he nevertheless oh my God I got to read that one again to you I guess cuz some of y'all didn't catch that our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies but provoked him at the sea even at the Red Sea nevertheless he saved them nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake amen you may have been crying out and moaning and groaning but nevertheless God's word is going to be fulfilled nevertheless he's going to find somebody that'll believe him somebody that'll hold on to the promise he saved them for his name's sake because he said he would he said I'm going to take take you out and I'm going to take you in that was his promise they should have praised him for that promise instead of moaned at him for the Red Sea cuz he already promised I'm he didn't just say I'm taking you out of Egypt he said I'm going to take you out but I'm going to take you into the land that's flowing with milk and honey so there was promises there if they would have listened and and and got a real revelation of it they wouldn't have worried about the Red Sea they wouldn't have worried about bitter Waters they wasn't have worried about no food and God already apparently had it all taken care of yes cuz if he didn't he might have warned him about it but he didn't even warn him about it he didn't tell him I'm going to take you out of a land but before you get to this land that's flowing with milk and honey there's going to be a red sea there's going to be dry there's going to be bitter Waters there's going to be problems there's going to be enemies there's going to be no food there's going to be no water but don't worry about it I'm going to take you into he didn't give them the whole road map he just told him this is where I'm taking you to that's all that we got in this day we God I'm going to take you into a Rapture I'm going to take you into a body change he don't tell you about the trials he don't tell you about the sicknesses he don't tell you about the trouble you're about to go through he don't tell you about none of that cuz he's already got the answer for it all he's looking for somebody that'll praise him no matter if they go through a trial if they go through a sickness if they go through a trouble they know God's with me yes sir and nevertheless he's going to save me he's going to move me cuz he has to do it for his reputation I will save I save them for my name's sake it was putting his reputation on the line let me tell you his reputation is on the line and God don't let his reputation be tarnished amen he he has a reputation of a Healer he's not going to let that reputation be tarnished he's got a reputation of a deliverer he's not g to let that reputation be tarnished oh praise the Lord then they believed and went and when believe with belief came praise that's right yes and if they had have kept the praise they would have kept their faith amen amen may I need to say it again if they had have kept the praise they would have kept their faith they would have maybe walked straight to the walls of Jericho yes but they went from praise again to complaining moaning worrying but God brings them he said listen they got to the point they got so moaning and so groaning God said I'm done with this generation I'll raise up a new generation and that's what he did he brought a new generation into the promised land amen I want to pick it up in Joshua 6 and verse one amen we know the we know the story Joshua going across and looking at the walls of Jericho he had seen them some 40 years before he knew what they were and so he's like God how are you going to do this I'm looking for the answer and while he's praying about it an angel comes down with a sword drone and he said who are you are you for us or against it he said no but I am the captain of the Lord's host and I have come down to give you the battle plan and we know the battle plan it says in Joshua 6 and verse one and Jericho was straightly shut up because of the children of Israel none went out and none come in and the Lord said unto Joshua see I have given you the land I given you to thy hand Jericho and the King thereof and the Mighty Men of Valor and you shall Compass the city all you Men of War and go about the city once thus shalt thou do six days and seven priest shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of the Ram's Horn and the seventh day you shall Compass the City seven times and the priest shall blow the trumpets and it shall come to pass when they make a long blast with the Rams Horn then you shall hear the sound of the trumpet and all the people shall Shout with a great shout and then the walls of the city will fall flat and the people shall Ascend up here every man straight before him verse 15 and it came to pass on the seventh day that they Rose early about the dawn of the day and compass pass the city after the same matter seven times only on that only on that day they can pass the city seven times and it came to pass at the seventh time at the seventh seventh at the seventh time when the priest blew with the trumpets Joshua said unto the people shout for the Lord hath given you the city so the people shouted when the priest blew the trumpets and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and the people shouted with a great shout that the walls fell down Hallelujah so that the people went into the city every man straight before them and they took the city he showed them that he would fight as they praised that's why I don't understand anybody that don't believe in shouting or don't believe in praising God don't believe in glorifying God he listen it's hard enough to get human Humanity out of the way Amen to praise God I don't know how they think it's just a bunch of workup amen it's hard to work some people out of the bed it's hard to work some people to get up and go do something amen what about working people to get up and praise God and to lose thems and dance and Shout listen this ain't a bunch of workup this is somebody that looks at the problem and say problem I'm not praising you I'm praising my God problem I'm not worshiping you I'm worshiping my God cuz my God Is Bigger my God is greater my God is stronger and he'll tear your walls down and I'll take that [Applause] City Hallelujah there's a bride that's making a shout and we're going to take the walls of cancer we're going to take that City hallelujah we're making a shout because inside of that wall it's some predestinated children of God and they have to get out to freedom and we're going to shout and walls are going to come down and we to go to go in there and loose God's children [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah if you want heaven to touch Earth then you let Earth Touch Heaven Hallelujah

place for one of his children to get [Music] Deliverance come on somebody God was aligning the rocks that a beggar could come down and sit down Aon it and he said what happened he said all of a sudden he heard a little clippity clop clippity clop he said what is that they said that's a donkey what is it going what's what's going on what's all the noise about what's all the shouting about he said

of Nazareth and he said oh I know that one I heard about that one I heard he healed a BL a man that had leprosy I heard he healed a lame person I heard he did all of these things and here I was just wonder where is that God and here he's walking right in my M he said what happened he said that blind beggar made a shout and a shout went forth and that shout amen touched heaven and Heaven turned around to that Earth and said come here and he set him free from what he was going through hallelujah amen last Sunday amen was some walls that came down what was it it gave somebody a place to rest

king of Assyria came against Judah one time and Hezekiah he tried to give what he could of his own he tried to give him gold you can read about it in Second Kings 18 tried to give him gold and silver even scraped it off the doors tried try to bease this guy and to not attack but he still he still kept coming still making his threats and then he came he said don't listen to your God he can't save you don't that sound like our enemy he can't do that well he can but I don't know if it's his will well his will is his word therefore he can cuz it's in his word amen he can't do anything for you you're too far gone there's nobody to be to defend you there's nobody to help you look at all the other kingdoms we've conquered their gods couldn't help them their gods couldn't save them neither will your God and he sends out his threats and he's coming to carry them out and so this time instead of Hezekiah turning to what he good he could do he turned to his God that's why 2 Kings 19 14 Hezekiah received the letter amen from the king of Assyria and Hezekiah went up to the house of the Lord and spread it out before the Lord that's a good thing to do with doctor's reports just spread it out before the Lord Lord you see what your enemies done to me you see what he's saying he's going to do he's going to take my life and he spread it before the Lord and Hezekiah prayed and he said oh Lord God of Israel which dwelleth between the cherubims Thou Art God Thou Art the god even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou has made Heaven and Earth Lord bow down th ear and hear Open Lord thine eyes and see and hear the words of sin and which has sent him to reproach the Living God and he goes and he said of Truth Lord and it goes on down yeah there he he said truth he said their Idols were then there their gods couldn't save them their gods are made of man they're made of wood and they're made of stone and therefore they have destroyed them but verse 19 oh but therefore oh Lord I beseech thee save th thou us out of this hand and all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord God even thou only what was he doing he was pray he was lifting God up this is who you are this is their gods but this is who you are this is what their God's done they're destroyed but you have not you are still here on the wrong and I want to praise you I want to Glory you I want to give you glory and honor in 2 Kings 19:32 says therefore thus sayith the Lord concerning the king of Syria he shall not come into the city nor shoot an arrow there nor come before it with a shield nor cast a bank against it by the way that he came is the same shall he return and shall not come into the city sayeth the Lord for I will defend this city oh Hallelujah I will defend this city to save it for my own sake and for my servant David's sake and it came to pass that night that the angel of the Lord went out and smoked the camp of the Assyrians 100 Four score and 5,000 and when they Rose early in the morning behold they were all dead Corps hallelujah hallelujah a Syria thought Syria thought they had a great Army their King thought they was undefeatable they had defeated many kings they had defeated many armies but God spoke and God didn't need an army he just needed one Angel that's [Applause] right one Angel killed 185,000 while they slept Hallelujah don't you know that same angel can sweep through a neighborhood hood and kill [Applause] cancer don't you know that angel can sweep down where your child is and cut the bands off don't you know that angel can go to where

matter what tomorrow holds I'm going to glorify him I'm going to praise him and while you're praising angels are being dis we're not talking about weak Angels we're talking about an angel that can wipe out an entire Army and send their King back home to meet his [Applause] death he just wants somebody that'll Praise Him yes the expression of Faith amen y one more 2 Chronicles 20 and verse one

voice on high with a loud voice on high and they Rose early in the morning and went forth in the wilderness of tocoa and they went forth josaphat stood and said hear me oh Jerusalem ye inhabitants of Jerusalem Judah you habitants of Jerusalem believe in the Lord your God so you shall be established believe His prophets so you shall prosper and when he has consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the Lord that they should praise the beauty of his Holiness and they went out before the Army and to say praise the Lord for his mercy endureth forever praise the Lord for his mercy
