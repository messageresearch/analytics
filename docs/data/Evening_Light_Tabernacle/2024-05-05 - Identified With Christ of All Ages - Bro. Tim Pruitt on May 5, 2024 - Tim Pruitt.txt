you amen and we know that you'll hear some wonderful word while we're away on Wednesday so you can look with anticipation to every service because God's going to meet you here amen he's going to speak so I pray that he'll speak this morning Romans 8 and verse 1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteous of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit God bless you can be seated we're going to speak today on the identified being identified with Christ of all ages and here as we are looking at this um wonderful thought today and the scripture that we have read I think of the greatest truths of all times is that of redemption and certainly that was what we were singing about this morning when we were singing he's worthy of it all he's the worthy lamb he was slain in God's mind before the foundation of the world so he the Redeemer was long came here long before the cner for sin ever entered the picture amen so the greatest truth of all times is that of redemption and from the fall of Man onward God's Plan of Redemption has been revealed and when Jesus came he told us to search the scriptures for he said they testify of me of who I am and what my Plan of Redemption is and if we can see Christ in the characters of The Bible and realize that these are not just stories are not just myths as I was as I was reading this week uh about Moses and and uh someone said that you can be a Christian and just believe that Moses is fiction I I can't be a Christian and believe any of the Bible is fiction I believe a true Spirit of Christ is going to believe the word of God Amen so you know but we can see Christ in the the characters of The Bible and realize that they're not just stories but men and women expressing and prophesying uh in their day with their lives The Plan of Redemption and if we can see that then we can see Christ in all ages and we can see ourselves also because we can see ourselves identified in him amen now you know the as we already quoted the Jesus said search the scriptures they testify of me in them you think you have eternal life and of course that's true and and yet they are the on he said that is bearing record of me or I am bearing record of them so if we are identified with Christ we too are going to be bearing record of the scripture today amen and for he says if Jesus said if I do not the works that I promised that I would do then don't listen to me but if I do the works and you can't believe me well believe the works because they they testify that he is the word so you know again he he spoke of Moses the laws and the prophets the Psalms and they were all speaking of him um you know the scriptures testified of him he as we have been through it before he was the Psalms of David he was the law of Moses he was he was uh manifest himself in the prophets they were all speaking of him and he is the principal theme of the entire Bible so if you read the Bible and you don't see Christ in it you should go back and read it again because he's there in every verse um he he is there whether it's um from in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth there's Christ we come down to the amen and Revelation every word is testifying of Jesus Christ so he said principal theme of The Bible he was in the prophets he was in the Psalms he was in the history you know it's more than history it's Christ in history brother Brandon would preach you know raising him up out of History where that you can see the god of history is the god that is here today and so he is in the Bible he is a thing that is to come he was before he is after and and that makes him then Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he says I am Alpha that means the beginning I'm Omega that means the end I am the root and I Am The Offspring so you see in all of it he it is him from A to Z from alpha to Omega from the first chapter and the first verse in in the Book of Genesis and the last uh verse in the Book of Revelation it's all Christ and it's a revealing of him and and of course when you when you get the picture of him you're going to see he's the same in in every detail and he's the same yesterday today and forever what he was yesterday that is what he is today so that makes him then the principal theme of our talking of our our thinking of our singing of our walk of everything we do and say is because he he is the principal theme of Our Lives if we are Christians today and then if he's the principal theme of The Bible and and the Bible is in us then he should be the Principal theme of everything that we do say or think it all should be Christ so before the fall Adam was identified with Christ he walked with him in perfect Fellowship mankind lost that perfect identity and ever since then God has been at work um to since the fall to change man's identity from that of a fallen one to a restored fellowship and restored sunship you know God wants you to know you're his children he wants you to know you are the sons and the daughters of the most high God and and that he wants you to know that so that you can experience all the blessings and all the benefits that comes by knowing him now of course you know as I said man came into this fallen in um image and he lost his true identity and his fellowship with Christ and yet Christ became one of us and took on the likeness of Fallen man to Lift us up out of sin out of the muck the m and the corruption in order to bring us into his likeness and that was Christ that that that Moses for example chose to be identified with if you look in the Bible in Hebrews 11:26 I want to show you it was Christ in the Old Testament and for he says that Moses esteemed the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward notice who it was it was he it was the reproach of Christ that he esteemed if you look at in um 1 Corinthians 10 and 4 the Bible said that they all did drink of that spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that Rock was Christ so you see it was Christ that was with them in the wilderness journey and then and of course it was they weren't just tempting Moses or chiding Moses or fussing against Moses and his leadership it was Christ because in verse n it said neither let us tempt Christ as also some of them tempted and were destroyed as serpents so again you see it was Christ now you know today we as as we have said many are in an identity crisis they don't know who they are even as a Americans many Americans have forgot their identity the college kids at our schools are the highest learning don't know a America of Revelation 13 as the lamb rising up with freedom of religion and that men fought and died for this Freedom that has been so precious but in the last day you you see it loses his identity from a lamb and begins to speak as the dragon so you know its identity becomes it shifts it changes from lamb and freedom of religion and and and um the extoling of Bible principles you know I I just just reading word that in the jail CES that they and I think it was in Minnesota where they painted all over over you know the law you know Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness and and and atheist came and toured the new facility with all of these things and sayings of of of of Great Men and great Americans that spoke highly of the Bible and Bible principle and Bible truths and and and all this was painted is on the wall and they're demanding it all to be repainted an apology put over said because you know atheist will not feel comfortable here in these jails well I don't think jails are made for Comfort I think they should be made for correction amen and they should certainly learn some principles of the word of God that says Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not kill it is it's a transgression of the law that makes men Sinners but you know quickly people have forgot their identity and and they don't want to identify with the Bible with the word of God but we as Christians you know we we should identify with the word of God with the promises and and see ourselves in the scriptures like Jesus said search the scriptures for in them you you think you have eternal life they're testifying of me and if we can see where they're testifying of him as the groom we should also be able to see where they're testifying of us as the Bride of Jesus Christ and you know brother Brandon would speak on this number of times and using his own uh n National patriotism and pride and identity to contrast with his identity with Bible characters brother Bram said what this nation is I am I'm proud to be that I'm ready to Bear ashamed I'm ready to Bear a reproach to an America American that's right but I'm double that to Jesus Christ all that he ever was I am I like to be identified with him them Apostles when they came back and they were made fun of and and everything else you know where where they thought it was a great honor to Bear the reproach of his name they were not ashamed to be identified with him when they walked down to the gate called Beautiful and said Silver and Gold Have I numbered such as I have give I unto thee and in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk and see a crippled man then walk and and and and not just walk but come leaping and praising God and and then they were called into the question you know in what name did you do this and they said we did it in the name of the one you crucified Jesus Christ it is him that has made this man both both whole and well you see they were not ashamed to be identified with him then they had to testify this about them said we know these men they are unlearned and and they don't they don't know any better but we can tell you one thing about them they have been with Jesus and that ought to be the thing that identifies us today that we have been with Jesus amen and when we have been with Jesus we're going to match what the word of God says we're going to believe the word of God what the word said and we're going to find our identity in the scripture now so we should be very happy today to be identified with the word which is Christ identified with him we've been baptized into him that's why we baptized taking on the name of Jesus Christ nobody was ever baptized in any other way in the Bible than in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ like a h wife takes on a husband's name and identifies with him like a child born in a family takes on the father's name and identified with him when we're born into the family of God we take on the name of Jesus Christ we become identified with him we are identified with his death by being buried in the water we we raise up from there to be identified in his resurrection we come out of there to walk in the newness of Life identified with him so to be a Christian you know we we were part of God before the world began we were in God's thinking we got the we got the you know we got this a brand new case of oldtime religion because we were in God's mind and he saw us when the sons of God shouted for Joy amen when when the Morning Star is sang together before the foundation in the world he saw us right here in time right here in this last day shouting rejoicing believing expressing the promise of God standing on the truth amen declaring he's my healer my deliverer My Savior he's my all and all you see we are here in time doing what we were seen doing in eternity we have a representation there and we were seen by God then and we are now acting out what he saw amen we are going we are a people of a Destiny and we are here in this last day fulfilling a destiny thanks be to God for that amen now so we can we can look here in the Bible and we could see that yes we were there we were there with for example with Abel when he got a revelation that there was coming a redeemer and he he drug a lamb up and he sacrificed a lamb and he understood this death is for me amen it's dying in my place we're we're the ones that sin we're the ones that done wrong amen but uh you see we can be identified with him as he cut hold through the darkness as it was and saw all the way down to Calvary where that there would be a lamb slain Hallelujah and thereby Revelation by faith I got that same Faith this time we're not looking ahead we're looking back and we see our lamb that was slain in our place amen we catch a vision of Calvary and it changes Our Lives because now the very nature of our lamb comes upon us and our iniquities are forgiven and our sins are gone and we're washed clean by the blood of Jesus Christ I tell you we are identified with Abel amen we are identified with with Enoch here's another character in the Bible who walked with God I hope you can identify with Enoch today I hope you can identify with him and realize hey this is an adventure yes amen Walking with God is an adventure and it's time to take another step amen Enoch walk he didn't stand still he walked he progressed Enoch was the seventh from Adam we are the seventh from the the seventh Church age amen and it's in that seventh Church age that there's a Rapture amen we are the Enix that are placed here in this last day who are going to walk with God Amen and have a testimony that we please God and become not an astronaut but a wasn not and we will change our Dimensions hallelujah amen we will change our Dimension go Way Beyond stars moon whatever else into the dimensions of the eternals and we're going to escape the things that are coming on the earth amen we can be identified again with we can we can and to be identified in all the Bible they were prophesying of us yes oh that's what I want you to see yes I want you to see they're the prophecy you are the interpretation amen you well I don't believe in tongues and interpretation well this was in tongues it was a mystery they didn't even know what they were doing they had no clue come on when Abraham to his son Isaac up on the hill upon the mountain on Mount Mariah and there would begin to offer his son he didn't know he was prophesy amen he didn't know in the moment of that test that he was speaking and foretelling of the Redeemer coming where that where that God himself would send his own son amen and dare through Redemption redeem us come on amen but you see you see they didn't know they were prophesying but they were prophesying they were the tongues we are the interpretation I'm looking at today interpretation of the word of God the Divine interpretation of God's word that's who you are now we can say then I was with Abraham when at the age Jus 75 and his wife being 65 and told they were going to have a baby I was with him when he took his stand on thus say the Lord you know I'm standing right there too amen I'm standing right there in the day where an old woman a 2,000 year old church that has been Barren holding a promise for many years sometimes giving up on it and letting Hagar bring forth a wild child of denominationalism come on Amen I you know I I'm right there with Sarah I'm identified right there amen you may not be but I'm expecting amen you may not be but I'm impregnated there's been a word that has impregnated me a supernatural event that took place and I'm expecting the promised son I'm looking for Jesus to come in this generation I'm identified with Abraham he was only prophesying of me you see this is where Jesus said search the scripture they testify of me I want you to understand this is the word of God that that is testifying amen you know I I I I can identify with them even in some of the in their moments of their Humanity I can identify when Abraham fell on his face and laughed I can identify when Sarah laughed in her heart I can identify with Sarah sometimes doubting the promise but God never going back on the promise come on amen he could not bless her in her doubt so what did he do he changed her from doubt to Faith neither could God bless you in your doubts so God has done what he's done in this generation to change you from outting to Faith again so that you can bring forth the promise amen I've been there I've been I've been there where the promise is laughed at and mocked where where the bondswoman mocks and makes fun of the of the child of the free I've been there I've been there I've been a part of that I've been there in those moments those are sometimes difficult moments amen but I I've also been there amen I'm also a part of the last life amen when when the when the here in the at the end there what is it Sarah is laughing come on she's rejoicing amen this time she's laughing because the promise has been fulfilled and I see a bunch of men and women today that are going to rejoice in fact to the matter is we can go ahead and laugh now we can already go ahead and rejoice now because we know the promise will be fulfilled hallelujah amen though it may hold long but yet at the same time I'm telling you this morning get ready for a celebration amen because we will have the last life over the devil when a 90y old woman gets strength and there she has strength to conceive and there she has her body renewed and milk veins renewed and everything else come on I'm looking at men and women that are going to be renewed changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye amen that when we stand there on that day we're going to [Applause] laugh in fact of the matter is the Bible said we're going to laugh at the Devil amen and the in the book of Isaiah said we will look down in the pit at him and we will laugh and said is this the man is this the thing that caused all the trouble look at him now amen look at him now we're we're going to we're going to be a people that is part of that promise because it has been spoken of us now so therefore we're with him we can be with we can be with him there on on the on the mountain in His Last Temptation be with him with Abraham on the top of the mountain when he's offering Isaac when we first learn the the phrase or the name Jehovah Gyra amen you know and and you know Jehovah Gyra in his original meaning means on the top of the mountain it will be seen amen and and again it was there on that same Mountain some thousands of years later Here Comes Here Comes Jesus carrying carrying his cross coming up to the mountain amen crucified upon the mountain amen upon the mount it shall be seen but it also means Jehovah the provider because here Abraham said there he said the Lord himself will provide for himself a sacrifice hallelujah amen my I'm identified with that that was that is you talking about Mountain Moving Faith amen said I don't know how he's going to do it amen I don't know but I know this me and the lb will return that's right I I I don't I don't understand how it's going to happen I've been told to take him up and but the Lord will provide a sacrifice and I know this me and this boy that's going on this mountain is going to come back and return amen I've got that same kind of Faith you've got that same kind of Faith we're identified with that amen but there on the top of the mountain to know him as Jehovah gy you've seen him in your life you've witnessed him in your life many times where he provided where he was more than enough where he was El shedi amen the god of more than enough I want to tell you about your God this morning amen he'll reveal himself to you like he did to Abraham I'm more than enough I'm not just your healer I'm your Miracle Worker I'll turn the impossible situations around amen I'll deliver you from all of your diseases for I'm the Lord God that heals all of thy diseases amen oh my we can identify ourselves No Doubt with so many in the Bible and I don't know that I would have time to go through all of them so I'm just going to hit a few high points but if we think about Jacob Jacob here he he would wrestle all night with an Angel I'm identified with that amen I had that time too where I I was in that same shape so were you amen you were you were there a liar a thief a heel Grabber you know that that's kind of thing with with with him he always wanted the birthright it was seemed like always out of his reach and that's the way it seem sometimes sometimes with a lot of us Jacobs we can't quite just can't quite grasp a hold of it and we'll cheat and we'll do this and we'll try that and we'll do something else but it's all because beating on the inside of you all the time was a real Prince of God Amen you just had the wrong identity you were identified as a Jacob as a deceiver of someone of the world Amen but it would take this encounter with God that would change your identity and make you know you're not a deceiver amen you're not a sinner you're not intended to be lost you are a child of the most high God you are a prince a [Applause] prince I wrestle the same as Jacob did cuz I'm his brother amen and I'll tell you what after that wrestle you walk different you go in walking one way and then the angel touches you in the hollow of the hip and you come out walking a different way everybody can tell you've been with the angel your walk is different amen if you said well I've met the angel I I've got the spirit of God brother Tim I've been born again and you still living the same old dirty life let me tell you you hadn't met the angel once you ever made the angel there and wrestling out with him your life will be changed forever you come out walking different talking different acting different amen amen my goodness you know as we as we look at this as the Bible as a Bible unfolds we can go quickly on down to Joseph in the Bible Joseph was rejected of his Brethren are you identified with him amen you know there again because this boy was spiritual and the rest were carnal that made him become rejected that's what brother brandham said you know just just let a Christian acknowledge the things of God and live right and true and believe in the gifts of the Spirit and the working of the Holy Ghost he's going to be persecuted he's going to be rejected and Joseph was rejected because he was spiritual it was because of that jealousy that would cause them all to go down to Egypt and wind up being slaves because because they they um they were rejected Joseph and and the spiritual boy that he was amen but I was with him when he knew the reproach he had to stand by his Brethren amen you see what he was I am for we're all one in Christ I know what it is to Bear the reproach someone said to me he said brother Jim you know what do you think when speak people talk bad about you and and and castigate and talk down about you I said comes with the turf it's just part of it amen it's just part of being a Christian being a child of God for standing for truth amen the Bible tells us to beware when all men speak well of us amen but I tell you woe to them from whom offenses come touch my my anointing and do my profits no harm for he said I'll rebuke Kings for their sake so you see I was I was with Joseph and there when when he was rejected of his Brethren when he was sold as a slave and where that he he went there and yet a son of prosperity you know I'm looking at sons of prosperity this morning those who prosper in spite of what the devil tries amen the devil would do everything falsely accuse you throw you into prison and do you unjustly and whatever and everywhere you go you get blessed I remember some years ago I had I had some some people that that came and it was a man that he claimed to be one of the prophets that was going to go to Israel and he was had lived in a cave for three and a half years over there and you know and he came there and he he came and was trying to spread his little stuff around the church so I just invited him home with me I just invited him home with me I said uh hey you know come home with me so I sat down with him for a little bit and we talked and I went be went over some things with him and tried to explain finally I just I just put my fa my finger in his face I said listen you know I'm going to do like they did in the book of in the Book of Revelation I said they tried them that said they were Apostles and were not and found them liars and I said because they were not saying what Paul said you're not saying what the prophet of God said so you're a liar and the reason I had you to my home was to keep you away from the people and you know he began to began to speak curses upon me and I just smiled and I said curse me please keep on cursing me because the more you curse me the more I will BL be blessed God will turn every one of your curses into a blessing you you see you cannot curse a child God God will bless you every time men revile you don't worry about it don't fight against it amen just let them do whatever they want to do as brother Ram talked about it he said when Jesus was on his way to Calvary and they were mocking him he never stopped he never he never looked around he never answered them he kept just going right on he said he had too big a job to do than to listen to their scoffing he said big men don't listen to that I said God make us bigger men said this is criticizing not criticize them hey make us bigger men bigger men that just don't even notice don't pay any attention to scoffing amen because you see there was Joseph no matter where he was God blessed him prospered him I want you to know that's where you are today God's is going to prosper you and everything never never forget you're a son or daughter of prosperity amen he's going to prosper you in your field he's going to bless you in the country he's going to bless you in the city I'm telling you amen you say well brother Jim what about all those curses that follow me he took my curses I don't have to worry about the curses he took them he became my sin that I might become his righteousness so therefore I'm inheritance of the blessings but not the cursings hallelujah amen do you realize you cannot be cursed amen you are not under a curse and you cannot be cursed you're under a blessing amen so you see Joseph was in prison and yet he was taken from there exalted to the right hand of of pharaoh you see God will exalt you in due time this is the B just just wait on the Lord don't don't worry about it don't cha wherever you're at learn something be a Christian wherever you're at if you're in a trial be a Christian there amen that that's exactly what I said you know when when my wife passed away I said well whatever it is that I'm going through I know one thing I'm just going to behave as a Christian I'm going to hold my head up amen I'm refuse to be pulled down into the SLO of despond I am not going to be sit down in unbelief and doubt and fear I'm going to just rejoice in my God that all things are working out for my good amen that God will somehow turn the trial into a blessing I don't know how I don't know when I don't know when it'll break I just know amen there's a new day coming amen that Mercy comes with every new day and there's new mercies and new blessings and New Joys and greater peace and greater understanding amen that's my future amen my future isn't Brokenness my my future is glorification for him that he is Justified he will also glorify so you see I was there if you're a Christian you are too and your time of exal is going to be there in fact to the matter of the bride of Christ brother bradam said that there will be a showdown and in that Showdown he'll take his bride up and take her up and show her to the world and away he will go amen so you see your time's coming amen your blessing's coming it's on your wayen now if you're a Christian you're you're identified with Bible characters so I was with Moses at the burning bush all right right I know I heard his voice I saw his glory I saw the pillar of fire back in that bush talking to Moses you see what that what was in that Burning Bush was what Moses lacked you know sometimes we all have tried on our own to to make things happen to bring a Deliverance Moses did that killed one Egyptian and ran for his life a failure now and and now out there for many many years and thought God had forgot his promise God never forgets a promise amen God can't forget you he said why could a woman forget her suckling babe you know you know is that is that possible he said yeah that could happen but he said I could never forget you while your names are engraved on the palms of my hands come on Amen when he took those Nails in his hands he identified himself with you he can't look at his hands but say oh yeah I've got some people I paid for oh yes I paid for their healing oh yes amen you know you tie little things on your hands sometimes remember I remember my dad you know got up in age and got forgetful and and so he would take and and and and he wanted to stop by what a watch shop that you used to be in Dixie in and he wanted to stop by there and so he puts it and he wraps it around his finger and drives with it all the way gets to report with it on his fingers you see he forgot but Jesus can't forget you you're not forgotten amen he's your comforter he's one that cares you say well but I'm in my senior years now brother Tim me God can't forget you he didn't forget Abraham when he was in his senior years he didn't forget Sarah and her senior years and fact of the matter is he didn't forget Moses in his senior years he was 80 amen if you waited on go to happen with you like it did with Moses and God waited to going to wait till your 80 to to really start using you but what I'm trying to say is you're never too old you're not Out Of Reach you're not out of Mercy you're not out of Grace you're not out of you're not too young amen you see when God speaks to a man he has Faith he has ambition he has a purpose you saw that it should you should have read that this morning when God speaks to man he gives him a purpose when God speaks to man he gives him ambition when God speaks to man he gives him Faith to do it to accomplish or achieve what his purpose in life is what God called him to do and he called us to be in the Church of God so God didn't send us a message and speak to us without giving us faith without revealing his purpose his plan and giving you the ambition amen oh yeah but I know I know what it is to be on the back side of the desert I know what it means to be there and need an experience with God but once you meet him in that experience it sends you on a path to Deliverance come on why in the world do you think this bride has had such an experience with the pillar of fire in this generation Amen to send us the path to Deliverance amen listen every everyone who has been filled with the spirit has stood before that same burning bush and received your anointing and your commission Hallelujah you can identify with Moses you know why because you met the pillar of fire now you may not have seen a flickering light amen you may not have seen a bush that is on that is burning but you met the same Pillar of Fire which is the Holy Ghost the spirit of the Living God it came and indwelled on the inside of you and gave you an experience that the world didn't give you and the world can't talk you out of Amen you see it's the same burning bush where that you receive your commission and where you received your anointing amen amen I know I remember I I remember my meeting with him I've never been the same I can never be the same amen God sent sent us for a purpose of Deliverance come on to Proclaim Liberty to them that are bound to open up the eyes of the blind to comfort those that mourn amen amen to to to provide the word of God with Robes of gladness to and you can take off your your robes of Sorrow Hallelujah this is what we have done God has anointed you amen when you realize you are under an anointing in this day you're anointed as adopted sons in an adopted age you know Luther Luther Pro was like in the church in his infancy coming up like the little blade it's in his empy and then it and then it comes up in his juvenile state with with with um Wesley and then it comes up in his teenage years with the zeusa street but we're not there I don't identify anymore with a teenager I don't identify as a teenager I don't identify as an infant I don't identify as an adolescent amen I identify as as an adopted son placed positioned know who I am called for a purpose redeemed blessed assured amen listen this is this is the age of adoption we are here and this message adopts you into the into the into the which which when we mean adopted we're we're talking about recognizing you as coming to maturity manhood that amen this is the age of the Bride where the bride amen is no longer an infant you don't marry an adolescent you can't marry a teenager that is too immature but we come to a time of maturity a bright time where that the woman that's turn it out in emphas is now grown and able to take his life and reproduce him am bear his identity so I was with Moses I was with Moses I'm identified with him and I'll tell you you can be identified with Moses when you show his sign and the devil just hardens his heart and becomes more stubborn but I see Moses is a man who was anointed and he didn't give up come on he didn't go and accuse God of failure and give up and run back to the desert he come back with another plague come on church amen that's exactly what we do when we're identified with Moses you take God's promise and the devil hardens his heart you just come back with another plague release another word on him hit him again amen till your enem is destroyed come on Amen you do it again and again if it's one time two times all the way to 10 times it doesn't matter you stand right there because you've got a Word of Promise Let My People Go Hallelujah and that's the way we stand this morning we're not backing up we're not running back to the desert we're not like cowards going backwards come on we're going forward amen we just come back with another plague we'll rain we'll rain hell down on the devil hell yeah we'll bring him his own torment and we'll use heaven to do it cuz heaven will move hell come on church amen Listen to It's it's about time it's about time time that we as the children of the most high God realize that we're not here playing games but we are here prophesying to be here in this day this is our destiny this is our hour this is the day that God has caused us to rain we are here to reain we are here to rule to take Dominion to take authority amen so Moses down there in Egypt I'm identified with him even when the devil hardens his heart you stand right there I was there too you know you go and of course you see a lot of times it's that away it's so it's so difficult because on one hand you got the devil Harden his heart Pharaoh hardened his heart becoming more stubborn and then the people saying why did you mess with us you made things worse things aren't getting better they're getting worse I know what it is to be misunderstood by Brethren I've been there amen but what do you do you go right back and just bring another plague on the devil he don't move this time just bring another one I'm identified with that that's the way we ought to be this morning identified as a people who never give up who stands right there on the promise of God and we keep knocking and we keep asking and we keep seeking until the door opens and finally we see identified with Moses when he gets the revelation of the perfect lamb of the Passover receiving a lamb without blemish I'm identified with that because I have come bringing my lamb without blemish a worthy lamb I've applied the token of the blood to the openings of my life to the body the spirit the soul just as they applied it to the opening of their dwellings you see I'm identified them with my sacrifice as brother brandham told us in the token message he said we find our identification is with our sacrifice the life of the sacrifice is in us which is the holy spirit when that cell was broke it released God that he Sanctified a people with his own blood and put God in man again God in you eternal life now that's something the Lamb's blood the animal blood could not do but the blood of Jesus Amen release the spirit of God Amen and put God in the man again hallelujah amen like like anybody should know you know that Zoe in the Bible Zoe means God's own life he said I will give you Eternal or Zoey life God's own life isn't it amazing to realize we got God's life in us that we're attributes of his thoughts even before there was a foundation of the world and all you was in his thinking and now we're at the display of his thoughts and his own life is now within you now back then in moses' day they were foreshadowing but now we can identify ourselves in them in the scripture you see Jesus did the same for example let me give you an example he said as Jonah in was in the belly of the well for three days and three nights so shall the son of man be in the heart of the earth so you see he identified himself in that scripture what to others was just a story was to him a prophecy and Jes Jesus looked at and said there's the prophecy I'm the interpretation so as Jonah was in the belly of the well three three days and three nights so will the son of man be in the heart of the earth so he could look there in a Bible character and see himself and his victory that's what I'm trying to get you to do this morning because you see the mystery down to the Ages was Christ the mystery now is Christ in you amen amen I I you know what what I want to do is I want to see those Bible characters come live out in your life I want to I want to bring out the David that's in your life amen come on the Giant Slayer I want to bring out the Moses in your life the deliverer amen come on I want I want to bring out the Enoch in your life I I want to bring out those they're there come on if you got Christ in you because that was Christ in them amen if you got Christ in you you it can be brought out what is in there when you when you meet a obstacle when you come against an enemy when the when the thousands come against you you can stand right there on the promise of God and see the word come to the Forefront for his children and display your token your identification yes that you're identified with Christ now it was Christ all the way down to the Old Testament and finally finally you see he was the fullness of the godhead bodily so all that was in him in them came in Jesus see David had the Psalms Solomon had the wisdom the the prophets had the prophecies Moses had the law but now it comes all encapsulated in one body Jesus Christ so he becomes the wisdom of Solomon the Psalms of David the law of Moses the pro Prophecies of the prophets he becomes all encapsulated he's the fullness see they had been working out it was God's revelation and then from there as as you see in restoration God does the same thing until again we become the fullness of the scripture because now the fullness of the godhead bodily dwells within the church amen because all the scripture is in her so you see Jesus had to come in order to take away sin and no one else could do it no one else was worthy to do it there was none other none other man that was out blim but him he was holy un without blemish undefiled amen no one else could do it no one else was worthy and when and and he did it and when he did that life was released from that body of that man which was the son of God remember God's creative power made a building like a contractor he built a building that God moved himself into and then when that life was taken the blood the chemistry poured on the ground like Abel's poured out on the ground but from that blood came the Holy Spirit and was sent a man that on the day of Pentecost to be identified with the sacrifice that died for them you see there's no other way we can get it it's a positive token it's a true identification so we're identified with him as the groom was prefigured in them so is the bride therefore we know we know we're like them in that Exodus brother Brandon we call this the Third Exodus and we know we're like them in that Exodus we're going out when the day Dawns and the trumpet sounds remember they were to stay in their their dwellings eat the Passover until the day dawned and the trumpet sound when the trumpet sound everybody's ready to March we're leaving amen are you ready for the trumpet amen we've heard you shout it's a mighty message it's a prophet bringing a message of restoration that speaks a bride into existence then it becomes manifested in Bride form who becomes The Voice Hallelujah are you the voice of the Resurrection I was dead but now I'm alive I was in prison in tombs of denominationalism but the the doors have been blasted open and now I come and you'll never seal the bride of Christ back in any tomb again Hallelujah you'll never go back to the tomb that can't seal you there's not enough seals to put on you to keep you in a Baptist tomb a Methodist tomb my Pinnacles of Tomb you raised up out of there fly up never to go back in it again amen you are the resurrection you are its voice I was dead but behold I am alive forever more and I've got the keys to Satan's eeden it can't hold me in it can't lock me in I've got the keys come on isin't that what Jesus said you ought to be able to say the same you're identified with him amen young people you've got the key it can't hold you complexes Can't Hold You doubts can't hold you fear Can't Hold You suicide Spirits Can't Hold You habits of the world can't hold you you the key amen the key has been given to you because you are triumphant and I know this like Israel they went out with a high hand amen I I'm going out here with a high hand spoiling our enemy amen they borrowed from the Egyptians garments to wear and jewelry and you know in this way they not only got freedom but they got payment for years of slavery do you realize you're getting paid back for everything the devil stole from you come on Amen you're taking your children you're taking everything come on you're taking every promise we're not leaving a hook behind you're fixing to get paid back for years and years and years and years the devil has tormented the devil made you a slave the devil did this the devil did that but you're about to get payback you can be identified with them this morning you can see yourself in the scripture like Jesus said Lay Me In The Grave I'll come out in three days amen I can say let the devil do his worst Jesus has done his best amen and I'm coming out with a high hand I didn't pay back for all the things the devil done to me Hallelujah they borrowed from the Egyptian garments to wear jewelry this way they not only got freedom but they got payment amen God didn't want them to go to the promised land looking like slaves dress in rides but to go but go dressed as Sons Sons of the most high to walk into a new land in the same way we're getting back everything the devil stole from us we will be wearing clothes of immortality amen he said in Deuteronomy to he said in Deuteronomy your clothes have not waxed so upon you thy shoe Has Not wax old upon your foot so that like theirs our new bodies will never wear out or get old come on Satan in the beginning robbed us from our immortal morality we're about to get it back there is a change from Mortal to immortality back then was a change from immortality to Mortal now comes the change you are in the moment of change you're going out of here with a high hand you talk about the LA new life the last life amen oh my we're going to laugh I'm going to laugh I'm going to laugh brother Tom seeing you young again all your hair right color again no wrinkles a spring in your step running dancing laughing rejoicing come on am I I'm going to look for that for you brother James Wilson same thing it's a promise laying right there in front of you it's a promise laying in front of of every one of you this morning anden you're going to laugh you're going out of here with a high hand you're not going out of here defeated broken rejected pass down you're going out of here rejoicing why we can go ahead and rejoice about it cuz we already see ourself in the word amen Jesus could look at the grave and say you can't keep me down hell you can't keep me and I say Satan you can't hold this right down it's impossible for you to hold her down she is the chosen of the Lord and it is her Destiny to go out of here with a high hand Hallelujah to come out of here with a body to won't wear down that'll never get tired amen won't need sleep Hallelujah that won't have any gray on the on the head come on that will be changed in a [Applause] moment I've already been seen in my new body I've already been seen in my theophany I've already been prophesied to be there I'm not going to make it I've already made it Hallelujah don't what he can say and sum it up in Romans way we are more than [Applause] conquerors hallelujah hallu amen I was at the Red Sea when I saw the spirit of God move down and part the waters oh yeah not through a bunch of reeds like they claim today but through a 90ft sea I seen the spirit of God I walk with Moses to that dry ground across that Red Sea when he raised his hand and walked forward to Sea open I was identified with him there because I'm identified in Christ and I was with Moses in that hour I've had those Red Sea moments too I've had those moments where I believed I was following God's leading and I trapped here I'm trapped there got the enemy on my tail you know swear and going to do everything you can to me got a red sea in the middle and I can't get through and I don't know a way around and I can't go this way and I can't go that way I need something Supernatural Well I serve a supernatural God Amen and there with the Enemy if it was not for that Pillar of Fire the Holy Ghost they would have gotten to me and destroyed me and so would they of you you'd have been destroyed a long time ago but he held him off amen you so brother Tim I wish I had an angel you do the angels of the Lord encamp about those that fears them and delivers them I tell you what if I were you I'd prepare for deliverance amen cuz the angels are here all we need to do is get our eyes open and realize we got Angels there's angels all around us Satan can't do me no harm come on Amen there's angels all around us and I feel no alarm amen for Jesus will guide me he's always beside me there's angels all around us and Satan can do me no harm amen I've had red SE moments I've been surrounded on every side I've stood with Moses there I've had the enemy pushing me from behind threaten to to take me and destroy me amen and if it wasn't for the the Holy Ghost the biller of fire he would have but I instead of being lost in that moment cross through on dry ground because he makes a way where there seems to be no way said well the doctor said I have cancer and the enemy is breathing on my trail and here this obstacle there and here you know and man I I I'm not I've got this problem here it listen don't worry we serve a God that heals cancer he can open up that sea for you come on we've seen him do it amen I've experienced those things myself I've crossed through in fact every one of you have you everyone had your Red Sea moment don't you remember this where where that you cross through the Sea of the blood of Christ and your captors your taskmasters of sin died in the sea hallelujah oh if you all you have to do is look around and I can start pointing you out if I had to you can see nitin demons drug and alcohol Devils sex demons and lust demons and all kinds of sin Devils come on dead in the Red Sea of his blood he swore you would always be a slave he swore he would take you back to egyp he threatened you in every way but God opened up a red sea and then God drowned my captors drown my enemies no wonder we could be with Mariam and sing the song of Moses and take a tambourine and dance with shouts of victory for we too have overcome by the blood of the lamb and by the word of his testimony Hallelujah I stood about Mount Zion Mount Si I saw the thunder and lightning where the law was written by the Finger of God I saw it happen I was there when it happened I'm identified with that amen for th because there like those on the day of Pentecost experienced the same the law of God's nature was written in my heart amen and and like Israel where they Covenant with God and was married to him on Mount Si when I had my Pentecost I was United with him and I too can say we are united together with him as the Bride of Jesus Christ amen he wrote his law oh I've seen him do it I've seen him take young people who were bound with sin of all kinds and open them up with his Majestic finger of love and pin his nature and write his laws in their heart and you know what you don't have to preach them no more you don't have to say thou shal or Thou shalt not anymore it's on the inside of them living out come on Amen I've seen him do it it happened to me did it happen to you amen it happened to 120 in the upper room amen it happened it's still happening today as many as the Lord Our God shall call and you know what I ain't Mana with them in fact the matter of I'm still eating Mana I know what it is to gather Mana daily I know what happens too if you try to keep it over another day and it breathes worms and stinks and I realize you can't bring in yesterday's message and bring it in to today come on Amen it's it breeds worms and it stinks amen but I know what about Gathering it come on we we gathered it amen we we have been part of the manag gatherers God raining out Angels food from Heaven amen and not only that but we we also know we have eaten of the Hidden Mana you know there was Mana that fell out there but there was Mana that was taken into the inner courts and when it was taken into the inner courts of the Tabernacle the mo mana was gathered and placed behind the veil so that there would be enough for every generation to get a taste of that Mana amen I know I know it's there you know why because I dwell in the Tabernacle of the most high in the presence of sh of glory and I've ate eaten of that hidden Mana that was stored up for this generation I'm identified with it I can identify myself with that water coming from the rock I've been refreshed by it amen and I know what it is I drank from that rock I'm still doing it today that was me that was me and Moses come on I was there when he smoked the Rock and that rock was smitten for he was wounded for our transgression and he was bruised for our iniquity and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes I am healed delivered saved set free and out of that rock came not a Trinkle but rivers of water I found that rock I said I found that rock in the last day of the feast John 7:37 Jesus said he cried and said If any man thirst let him come to me and drink Israel was thirsty we ready to begin with that rock was Christ amen oh think about that and there they when they got thirsty he was smitten for a thirsty man we've all been thirsty times you know you you're looking for something to quits that thirst people will do it and they'll try alcohol drugs they'll try to try every kind of vice and sex sin and everything else to satisfy a thirst that's they were perishing in the wilderness unless you can get to that rock you're going to perish but I'll tell you he there is a rock and he's not that far away come on Amen it's Christ not only that but the Bible say Christ followed them the rock followed them do

gushes Up Out eternal life watching all the trash all the violence all the ideas of man it cleanses it sets free amen it's Living Water it's not a stagnant pool amen we're Believers and we're

and get through those walls it's impossible I mean they're 40 foot wide 80 foot tall I you know they can run they can run chariots around the tops how can I ever get in there and he's there viewing that wall and wonder now you know God has sent me to take down this wall and and and to get to conquer this city but I don't know how I'm going to do it it's impossible it looks impossible and he he's looking for a way he's out walking there and and in the middle of the night he meets a man and he pulls out his sword and he says are you for us are you against us and he said neither that's I'm not on your side and I'm not against you you're not on my side you're not against me no I'm your captain you're on my side hallu you forget sometime you think God is going to be on my side you get on God's side you get on his side your Jericho walls are coming down hallelujah amen because you chose the way of the Lord's despised you amen because you chose to believe him and followed him out left
