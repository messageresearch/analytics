people so plainly Lord we're we've been reminded Lord of a vision you said right it plainly so God it will it will speak in the end time though it Terry wait for it so Lord we're here today waiting on the understanding that you've given us in this hour thankful that you sent us a prophet messenger Lord that will but crack into those symbols Lord and just begin to reveal the Revelation the inspiration Lord behind each and everyone that there will be a people Lord God that will make preparation Lord we are that people this morning not just here at evening light Tabernacle but Lord those that believe and and follow the message of the hour around the world Lord you'll have a bride of every Kindred tribe tongue people and Nation Lord we're here today to reflect that bride to be a part of that calling out Lord we just invite you Lord this morning that you would come and just speak to us Lord minister to our hearts Our Lives father may you just establish on the foundation of Truth for we ask it this morning in Jesus name amen and amen if you have your Bibles this morning we're going to look back here pick back up on the thought we had this past Wednesday night on living in the hour of fulfillment and I actually want to give this morning's message a subtitle under the cover of Darkness so living in the hour of fulfillment under the cover of darkness and we look here at habc 2 and verse two and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon the tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and lie not though it t wait for it because it will surely come it will not t God bless you you can have your seats this morning we think about this phrase here under the cover of Darkness that actually means hidden by the darkness of night so we want to look at some things that have taken place in our day in this age things that that take place under the ospice of darkness and we're going to kind of get into that this morning and trust that you're not in a hurry today and understand this Labor Day weekend and we have a guest speaker it's not me but it's the Lord so let's just treat this service as touch this morning but we want to look at the things and we can find that things that are taking place in this day because the light has dwindled out and notice the light is only with a handful of people and to refresh from our service this past Wednesday we we recognize the word Vision here means a prophecy it means a Divine communication a dream of Revelation or an oracle so we understand that without Vision Without this divine intervention or this divine revelation the people perish and Amos 3:7 tells us that God will do nothing but he revealed his Secrets unto his servants the prophets so before the end can come the prophecies regarding the end time must manifest they must be fulfilled therefore before the end time can come before God can return for his second coming God has to send a prophet messenger all right God has to send another Elijah and and brother bam says this Prophet Messenger will be in the nature and and manners as were Elijah and John we also understand through the Wednesday night God never changes he always does the same thing the coming of a prophet is a sign that God is ready to speak Church we're not looking for another Prophet we're not looking for another messenger we've received the prophet messenger for this age and I believe that he has spoken to us and brother B says a prophet is a special man a prophet is a man whom the word of the Lord comes to because the prophet is so so designed that his subconscious and his first conscious is so close together that he doesn't sleep when he dreams and brother man would tell us now this prophet he foresees things way off things that is coming he sees the cup of God's Wrath full before it's filled so we want to look at these things and I I find it so important that the prophet of God will preach a message in 65 and we're going to go into a little bit of it today but modern events are made clear by prophecy so and though we're living in a dark age we're living with darknesses all around but I want you to understand we've received the light we've received a Vindicated message and we understand that we can look back at prophecy not just the prophecies that he's made but go back into the prophets and of old Isaiah Haba Jeremiah different ones Daniel and we can see that those prophecies are made manifest today and we can see the modern events in which we're living in they're made clear cuz we can look back God is sent us a prophet that's rose up and he caught the inspiration of those forerunners or those prophets that's gone before him and he's brought the inspiration down and revealed it to you and I you believe that this morning so he says he's like an eagle he can fly high into the atmosphere and he sees what's coming so I want you young people again we're because this is going to be a refresher for many of us older people that's been in the message for years or maybe some of you are new here new to the message I want this to be something that'll ground you in the faith you young people that'll ground you in the faith to understand why we believe what we believe and how the prophecies the interpretation of these propheties they not only vindicate a prophet but they vindicate you as the the one to receive the prophet messenger we were not just receiving him but we're receiving the message and that message is what translates our bodies brother says now God likened a prophet to an eagle that would go up in the makeup of a prophet he's a sear that is in the spirit he comes beyond the emotion of a church he goes beyond the rhythm of music goes beyond the Clapping of hands he goes beyond the joy among the saints he goes beyond all that God brings him up into the rim of loone then he opens his eyes and he lets him look around and he sees things that is to come then he brings him back down among the members of the body to for tell them of what is in the m so the prophet is here when we understand why God sends a prophet then we can understand the hour in which we're living because he is to make known the current events he's to make known what's going on around us he's to make known all those that's been prophesied before him he comes and catches that inspiration he said he rides way up yonder he looks way off there and he sees that Cup of Wrath poured out that's what the prophet's looking at he's not looking at what's going going on here he's looking Yonder see he's saying it's coming he can go so high till he can see the shade he said now the world will be dark darkness and gross Darkness he's up high enough the sun shining now but he sees the shade coming he's saying what he's looking at it ain't here yet but it's sure to be here that's right it's going to be here gross Darkness upon the people he knows it's coming years away but yet he sees it amen so brother Brand's picking up the inspiration of Isaiah and so let's turn to Isaiah 60 and verse2 and this is where we're going to start digging into under the cover of darkness my wife told me today she said look she goes don't you leave us in darkness I said don't worry we're coming out but we got to understand the hour in which we're living in we got to understand we can see the darkness and when you can see these things begin to manifest it only show knows who you are and where we are in time and how close we are to the coming of the Lord so we find here in Isaiah 60 verse2 says for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth the darkness shall cover the Earth and gross darkness of people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee so when we look at this word Darkness here it means Misery the destruction death ignorance sorrow wickedness now you tell me what other age has seen Misery the way we've seen misery in this hour they've seen destruction death ignorance sorrow wickedness look at the wickedness of humanity right now and you think how in the world could it get possibly get any darker than the hour in which we're living in but the Bible says Darkness the darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness to people so Isaiah the prophet he was lifted up high in the spiritual realm notice he looked beyond Calvary he looked beyond Pentecost he looked way down into the seventh Church age and he saw this hour he saw this day and notice he could see that it would be so dark that gross Darkness would be upon the people notice he proceedes where the day where right is wrong and wrong is right he can see where we the day that men will try to be women and women try to be men yes come on where neutrality among the children is accepted and they can decide what they want to be but B despite their biological body parts he sees a day where animal life has more value than human life where abortion is accepted but you can't take an ego an egg from an eagle you get a prison sentence he's looked and seen today in which we're living in he's seen today where insanity is among all those who don't have the Holy Ghost don't you understand young people why it's important that you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost for if you don't have the Holy Ghost you will go into utter Darkness yes and the message of Shalom and I believe that's a great wonderful message because it means peace yes and he says this gross Darkness I wish to speak on first he says there's so much of that in the world today my goodness this is a 1964 where are we at today in 20124 notice they're growing and it's growing darker and darker all the time each year we find that the world's getting darker spiritually speaking because they're groping in darkness and there is more sin just passing through what we have the assassination of the president and so forth and people being murdered right here in our country amen notice now he says he says where we wouldn't think that would happen in a time of modern civilization but we sure have it because gross darkness is upon the people those who will not turn to light then there is only one thing that can for this coming year you're going to he says you're going to get stooped darker and darker as the year goes on and some of you young people there's a spirit that lays over you just wait a little bit longer just wait a little bit longer you know you got time you got time look you don't have time time is coming to fulfillment we're living in a day where time is about to be all wrapped up and we're about to head back to Eternity you got to make sure you're calling an election now you got to make not just you're calling an election you got to make sure you have the goods that you got the Holy Ghost living out through your life and you're not just playing Church you're not just born in a message home you don't just come to a message church and hear message preach and preach day in and day out but you got the The Giver of the message inside of you portraying the word of God living according to the word of God feeding on the word of God becoming the light in this hour and I will Echo the words of a prophet Shalom peace I give unto you he says but those who will turn on this New Year's to the light then you shall get brighter and brighter until that perfect day that we look for his appearing where all Darkness will be faded away he says that's the reason of that is why I say to the Church of the Living God today Shalom because we are his light church if you doubt that there is darkness in the land just go out go look on CNN go look on Fox News my goodness social media it's broadcasted all over it yes there's no reason why we should stick our head in the sand and act like we're not living in the last day we are living in the last daysen but notice just because we're living in the last days shouldn't bring fear and torment and intrepidation upon us it should let us know we're that close to going home we're that close for the greatest prophecy to ever hit the face of the Earth the greatest Prophet that there will be a group that alive and remain at my coming they will be changed in a moment in the the tweaking of and I look in the midst of Darkness there's still going to be a prophecy fulfilled and I'm looking at people today men and women boys and girls who will fulfill that prophecy of a body change but it takes place in the midst of gross Darkness under cover of Darkness he's going to snatch out a bride woo I don't know about you but that does me good yes I mean I can't put my hope in politics I can't put my hope my trust in man I can't put it in business I can't put it in my own my own self I can't put it in my family but I can put it in him I can put it in this word because we know heavens and earth will pass away but this word will never pass away notice he says here the prophet said Gross Darkness upon this people upon the people of the world gross Darkness not just darkness but gross darkness and that word there means a dark fog or Cloud dense people's minds are so clouded today amen come on some of y'all should say Amen to that amen you bump head long into them each and every day think about this have you noticed in the last few years some of you men and women around my age that how each year it seems that that darkness comes more and more he goes I was speaking the other day I said to my wife you know it seems like as the years goes on as it just seems like the people begin to get further and further away from the real thing that we should be coming closer and closer to and look it even is happening within the ranks of our message people are getting further and further and further away from the thing they should be getting closer and closer and closer to well they think what this message is all about a man or this message was only a man's idea it has nothing to do with man at all we look here in Genesis 6 and verse 5 we're going to see what God thinks about he said God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of his thoughts of his heart was on evil continually now this was in the beginning this is in Genesis so where is the heart of man today if the heart of man in Genesis was on evil continue where are we at in society today when we've been through seven Church ages or we're down at the end of the seventh Church age every thought every imagination of man is own evil you can't go anywhere without evil being portrayed murder rapes crime everything drugs different things of that nature all being pushed in front of you it's that dark in the hour in which we're living He says notice now among man he could look on the streets and the most and most among women he says watch their desires and watch like today he says they're changing attitudes all the time men are becoming more like women now come on Evite amen that yes sir men are becoming more like women and women are becoming more like men it seems like there's no way to stop it he goes across the nation preaching against the thing and come back next year and it's worse than when I started see it's them people they want to do right but there's something about it won't let them do it it just pressings them down forces them it's like a heavy dark fog over the whole earth so gross darkness is upon them not only in Phoenix but over the whole world there seems to be just a roping Darkness that's Gathering getting more dense and dense all the time just smothering out real manhood real Womanhood I'm talking in the natural Amen brother Andrew Glover and I were in Los Angeles a couple months back and we were preaching there at San Marcos for the Believers there and we went to Los Angeles just to kind of trace the footsteps of the prophet and we got to do a lot of things and we actually got a you know the night before we left we went checked into a hotel and it was a it was a nice hotel and we come walking we're going to the elevator and all of a sudden here comes some 6' three 6'2 strapping man with a minis skirt on about to hear a purse over his shoulder makeup on Andrew looked at me and I looked at him like I mean hey he was a nicel looking guy but he wasn't a nicel looking woman but we fine he come just walking in like it high heels on minis skirt with a purse over his shoulder makeup on headed to the front FR counter let me tell you we're living in the hour of darkness and yet the world and the world system wants to make you okay with it that they say you have to accept it but they don't have to accept our standard they don't have to accept our rules but they want you to accept them and and receive them and include them into our society let me tell you where it's an Abomination then it's Abomination today it'll be an Abomination tomorrow we're going to stand with this word but we see it men are groping in darkness and he said it's coming more and more into our churches when you say I don't believe that brother well I'll just show you today various Christian denominations are accepting the homosexual and TR transgender identity and inclusive of the homosexuals and transgender people such as the Episcopal Church the Presbyterian Church J United Church of Christ and the Metropolitan Community Church they all accept these Lifestyles into their churches into their pulpits in order to accept this you have to reject the word of God you have to compromise on the word because the word stands against this God never changes his thoughts he never changes his ideas about it if it was sin and Deuteronomy it's sin in this hour it's sin again in this day he never changes his Focus but notice he said is coming more and more into the churches and then when you raise up and say something against it then they condemn you for it we had a football player not us but the world had a football player last year toward the end of the year I believe was a kicker for some team and he gave his own inter his own idea he's a Catholic and thank God he stood for something but he he he stood against the world system or something they were there and he CAU all kind of persecution for standing for biblical principles because here we find here this is in 1964 the something against it to go against their accepting attitude of it they want to condemn you or they want to persecute you they want to say well you're you're intolerant well absolutely right we are intolerant to sin I'm not going to tolerate it in my house I'm not going to tolerate it in my family I'm not going to tolerate it in my church I'm not going to tolerate it I'm going to stand against it because we're standing for the truth in this hour but notice before a church or people can accept the lifestyle of transgender homosexual neutral gender neutral identities and things of that nature we have or they have to first reject Christ and Christ is the word so we believe we believe in the coming or we believe in coming as you are we believe in coming as you are but don't stay as you are I was being told just the other day we were there was a a a a someone in a church we were having fellowship with brother Micah and Sister Amy and different ones at a big church over there one of the famous Church in shreport I say famous big church I'm not going to give the name of the pastor but there was somebody that came to the pastor and said there was a gentleman coming to that church and he was a homosexual and he dressed I guess he dressed in drag dressed like a woman he'd been coming for a year and the person went to the pastor and complained about it he said well the you know well God says you know he what did he say he uh you know he he lived among Sinners or he walked among Sinners yeah he may have walked among Sinners but he changed them that's right that's the thing about it we're okay if you want to be homosexual come to even like Tabernacle but be changed be expected to be changed we're not going to tolerate with that lifestyle and it's no different than any other kind of sin whether it be drugs whether it be womanized no matter what it is you come as you are but come prepared to be changed let the word of God change you don't come and just grope in sin don't come and just grope in darkness when there's been a way out God had provided you an answer God provided us a way that we can escape the wrath that is to come come expect it to be changed don't come expected to be to be fed and just cuddled and just oh I just want to come and do my due diligence to be a Christian we come to the house of God to receive correction every service we come to be changed by the word and there no brother says when God sends a gift he'll vindicate that gift when the people received the message back in their day it was a jubilee for them but to reject it notice but when it's proven to be from God and the people were rejected there's nothing left but chaos see and if the people would receive it it would be a golden jubilee for that people if they would receive it but it always lays to the people God does his part so therefore we're not getting look young people you're not getting in on Mom and Dad's coattails you're not getting in on who your pastor is or whatever the friendship and the relationship you may have with your favorite preacher that's not going to get you in amen but we find if you will accept it though it'll be a golden jubilee to you what does that mean that means your heart will be overflowing with the joys of the Lord they won't be forcing you to come to church you won't come every two or three months and say oh well me and God we got this thing going you know we we're good but you ain't darken the house of God in months you think you and God got something going so what is God telling you that he ain't telling nobody else exactly notice the Bible says forsake not the assemblying together of those notice there's rules there look we don't make the rules God sets the rules we abide by the rules while I'm even going there I have no idea but maybe it's for somebody but the gospel of Christ has been rejected yes he goes you don't want to believe that but it's a noted fact it's the truth it's too bad but it's the truth so this is in 1957 Queen of Sheba when they were when they did receive it great signs and wonders and Jubilee broke out but when they rejected it then darkness and gross Darkness come to the people oh people of this last day can't you see why darkness is falling on the country so can't we see why darkness is falling on this country and every in the world today because they rejected the message notice brother brand indicts this generation for rejecting refusing crucifying the word aresh that's right God proved that it was him not William Brandon but him that was in this generation with infallible signs and wonders and the church leaders now rejected the signs they rejected the Wonders they rejected the message because it didn't come according to their system so they didn't reject Brother Brad I want you to understand that they rejected Christ that's they rejected his word they rejected the light for the hour that's right and they put Christ on the outside of his church notice now the reason that I indict this generation this is in the indictment 1963 he goes the reason that I indict this generation of guilty of crucifying blaspheming the manifested of the son manifest the Son of God as was promised by the prophets in Christ himself to be in the last days like it was in the days of Noah in the days of Sodom blasphemy which they crucified to the people the Son of God of fresh he is a Vindicated word one word against it can never be forgiven and he says I'm inditing the Pentecostals I'm inditing the Presbyterians the Baptist every denomination in the world by Wicked selfish greed you took the word of life and crucified it before the people and blasphemed it and called it fanaticism which God has raised up in the midst to prove that he is the same yesterday today and forever he goes I indict this generation that's so I'm going to piece some things together for you by God's grace this morning we're looking at under the cover of Darkness so how can how do this or how do we or how does a nation begin to grope in dark because they reject you have to reject the truth in order to grow in darkness so we find these things just didn't happen overnight all right Church it wasn't just all of a sudden the wicked scheme got uh got removed and all of a sudden they begin to enact laws and laws and laws and laws overnight and then all of a sudden no people wouldn't stand for that but we find they begin to do it all under the cover of Darkness because people rejected the people didn't want Christ they didn't want the Living Word in their midst they would they didn't want to tow the line to to Christianity but they wanted to go on in their own thinking in their own ways and God gave them over to a reprobate mind and then we begin to see Humanity begins to dwindle and dwindle and dwindle and dwindle and dwindle to the point that we are today living in Gross Darkness but he says here now notice now he goes I indict the Pentecostals I indict the Presbyterians I indict to baptist every denomination in the world by Wicked selfish greed you took the word of life you crucified it before the people and blasphemed it and you called it fanaticism that's right which God has raised up to prove that he's the same yesterday today and forever God has proved himself alive God proved that this is the word what you have has got is a bunch of dogma and creas he says what you got is a bunch of Dogma cre but where is the Living God at you got a bunch of Dolmas you got a bunch of Creeds you got a formality of Christianity a form of godliness but you deny the power of God to change a life he says because you turn down the word of life that would give you these things what an hour we're living in notice where did Jesus get his Spears where'd he get his Spears nobody he got his Spears where on Calvary he got them from where he got them from the Roman soldiers think about it where didd he get his Spears at in his side where did he get his Spears on calary where did he get it today in the Pulpit where did they come from Jerusalem where do they come from today denomination that's the one who claims to love him that's who did it that's who does it today his second Calvary where he receives his pierces against the word that's what pierces him who is he he's the word he is the word where is he pierc the hardest from the pulpit in the holy places just like it was then he says I got a right to do it as a minister of the Gospel of Jesus Christ with signs proving that he is God I got a right to bring indictment against this generation now he's not just indicting the denominations now he's inditing the generation come on Church he's inditing the people now because they didn't receive the light because they went with the denomination they went with the religious teachers they went with those that said it was fanaticism he goes I got a right as a minister of the Gospel of Jesus Christ what signs proving that he is God I got a right to bring indictment against this generation his hardest spear points has been right from the pulpits where they criticized and said don't go out there with that stuff that's of the devil right in the place that's supposed to love him and he said it couldn't been done 50 years ago but it could be done today so he's indicted in 1963 the generation therefore he said the time for repentance of a nation is gone now we go out there and we have denominational friends and pastors and different ones like that and we know what the world's crying for they're crying for Revival they're crying for you know they're crying for another Great Awakening America to come to her senses and I was listening to Jimmy Swagger the other day and I don't practice listening to Jimmy swager I just flipped it on there for a few minutes because he was preaching along these lines I'm like let me hear what he's got to say just kind of want to put that and you know Jimmy's over there talking about America and America's dying he's going about what's happening in the school system and what they're uh propagating to our young people in kindergarden and what they're doing some of the curriculums in fifth grade and let me tell you it's it's disgusting of what the society what they're trying to uh put over on our young people but we find notice it happens in the kids first so he's going along these lines and he's talking about the curriculum in the schools and how it's you know sex education and all these different things trying to just come in and warp the minds of the the children today and he's calling for America for a Revival in America for a Great Awakening in America and he says and I believe America's going to come to herself she's DED but she's going to revive again and I said oh Jimmy you don't know the truth God sent a prophet in this hour and he indicted this generation America will not revive America will go down in destruction because why cuz we have received the Vindicated message and he says I indict this generation for what crucifying the word calling it fanaticism said don't go out it's up the devil but let me tell you it'll change a heart it'll change a life it'll take a man growth in sin and make a Son of God out of them oh we're not looking for a World rde Revival but we're looking for a personal Revival a priz Revival in the land today will we stay close to this word brother B says now modern achievements is another sign of the gross Darkness we look here in Daniel 12 you don't have to put this up here I'll just read it Daniel 12 and verse4 says Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end for many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased they're going to run to and fro let me tell you there's never been a day like this day for information to run to and fro back in the day it was Pony Express you want a little girl you want to send a love letter to your boy man it take months to get there but today we got Snapchat amen I don't get no amens from you young people uhuh ain't calling me out Snapchat soon as you send itop it's on the other side and know it's there for a second and it's gone Snapchat it's there quick you get on Facebook you get on Instagram you get on Tik Tok get on all these social media websites the information is traveling so fast on them it hits that before it ever hits CNN Fox News or any other kind of news media information is traveling so quick today and knowledge is increased he says notice now these modern achievements of a super raise and so forth that we're living in is only the sign of gross darkness in the spiritual realm so I'm trying to share some of these things so you can see the hour in which we're living it's an hour of fulfillment but it's under it's under the darkness the cover of darkness in which these things take place he said people will get to a place they will fall away gross Darkness will cover the earth when spiritual Darkness gets upon the Earth it's time for the enemy to attack and he says at that hour Mercy wake up young people realize this ain't no time to be playing church let me just say this ain't no time to be missing Church be out there working on Sunday and doing whatever God knows what you do on Sunday you can't make time for the house of God this is no time to be playing with it that's right this is the time to make sure you got what you need so when that let me tell you we think it's bad now wait till we're gone yes the Bible says when he that let us will let let me tell you when we are out of here and the Holy Spirit lifts off this then he becomes the Beast watch out at that point you don't want to be here when that happens come on somebody you don't want to be here when the wrath of God and the Wrath of the enemy has poured out upon the people cuz he's going to Smite the remnant of the Bride he's going to Smite the remnant of the church as it was in the days of Sodom so will it be in the coming of the son of man just before the destruction of Sodom Abraham notice and the church got called out so I'm not going to leave you in darkness don't be a don't be afraid but I want you to be looking in the hour in which you're living here let your pupils get adjusted to the darkness that's right because you are the light of this hour God has sent you a message notice we're at the end brother B says these things were to take place we got them we're here now we're seeing them every day go out on the street tonight you'll see it tonight he says it's pling to writings on the wall on the streets in the skies everywhere the end is here I remember when I was a kid man people talk about the end time I get scared to death oh yeah come on brother L we didn't know nothing about the message did we man we were kids we didn't know nothing about it we didn't grow up in a message church but I tell you what when they talk about the end time man I shook everywhere I knew I had body parts I was scared that Lord don't let me go look I prayed every night and I sinned every day it was a bad fix I'd sin every day every night go to bed praying Lord please don't let this be today give me one more day give me one another time give me another oh but Hallelujah God saw my name on the book he didn't let me keep going that way but finally he let the message of the Hour come across my path on this saying that that predestinated seat no matter how far you go no matter what you did it's going to come to that life W Hallelujah church and now say now when I hear about the end time I don't shake R and roll but I throw on my hand say yes Lord come Lord Jesus this could be the moment this could be the day I'm waiting I'm ready for you coming it doesn't scare me anymore brother hell it excites me cuz now I can see that I've made preparation my name is on the book ain't no devil ain't no sin ain't no unbelief can take it away from there he says then when we see the fearful sights coming earthquakes tidle ways Falling Away gross Darkness hey High minded L was of pleasure now that's all for the world that's what the world is pointed to but the church has another sign yes that blessed called out sign he promised that there would be a latter of rain in the church the church spiritual in the last days he would pour out both former and lateral rain remember the the former rain come first then the latter second rain he says both former and latter in the same season he promised it notice what is the former Reign it's the teaching Reign and the latter Reign is the Harvest rign it's the spirit that comes upon what's been taught and it produces the crop and what we've received in our day church is both former and lat rain message we've been taught thoroughly by a prophet and then after the prophet leaves the scene the SP of God comes back on the same word that's been taught and produces the crop cuz it shows it's not tied to a man but it's always about Christ and I here to tell you this day this message produces an end time bride and if the latter Reigns come and the former Reign's been been given out where are we at where are we at when the rain has come and the messenger gone it tells us we're living in the hour of fulf fillment Isaiah 16:2 Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness to people but the Lord shall arise upon thee hallelujah oh Hallelujah is Right notice in the midst of chaos there's going to be a people that the Lord himself Rises upon and the Bible says and notice and His glory shall be seen upon thee that word Glory there is his reputation yes sir he's staken his reputation on his word and on his people and not not only is it going to be in the books any longer but now his reputation is going to be manifested in a living bride in a living body and written Epistles read and known above all men that's right let me tell you we want it more than just being on the pages of of all these books and in the Bible we want to be written Epistles we want the word of God to be made manifest in our lives notice in the hour of gross Darkness God will have a people that will manifest him you believe that it has been prophesied that he will rise Upon A people so if there's got to be gross darkness and there's also got to be the Fulfillment of this prophecy but we're going to look a little bit let's go down a little bit further we're going to look at these things brother BR says now notice he never changes his pattern of work he prophesies what will happen then he sends somebody down and vindicates that and it goes over the head of millions because Darkness covers the earth at the time the people love Darkness better than they do light cuz Darkness has a lot of pleasure oh brother Jonathan you used to love Darkness don't tell us anything about it right now but no sir many of us we groped in darkness some of you didn't cut your your teeth on the message Pew you groped in darkness you did these things you enjoyed it it was pleasurable to the flesh but it tormented your spirit cuz something inside of you wanted to do right I enjoy going to the bars getting getting drunk dancing like a fool but every night I laid in bed I pray God please forgive me because there was something greater there was a crying out there was a deep calling and I didn't know how to supply that need for that deep but one day one day a voice came down and said it's time one day one day let me tell you it's all it takes is one day church one day in his presence one day in the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit Well the inspiration is striking that's all you need is one day one moment in the presence of the king to change your life for eternity so we find he never changes his pattern Isaiah prophesied of our day that the world will be groping in darkness notice we're in political chaos right here true we're living in a woke generation if you don't know what woke generation means go look it up I mean everything is woke up we're living in there's Wars there's rumors of Wars not only in America but around the world and what did God do in this time God sent a prophet God sent a message to not only turn our hearts but to prepare us to tell us for to forew warn us of what's about to be poured out amen and we understand you know this brother B begins to bring the prediction and this is not in my notes I'm just going to paraphrase this but he predicts that he doesn't see it lasting Beyond 1977 now many of us as preachers and M Believers we claim that because he tells us that he makes the prediction but we look at it and we take from Isaiah here 60 and we begin to think you know what it's so dark even the prophetic lens couldn't Pierce that veil of darkness and he couldn't see past that so I say if we're that far beyond that many years Beyond 1977 just how dark are we now in 2024 that even his Prophet eyes eagle eyes couldn't Pierce that Darkness what kind of state are we living in as human today but notice he like an eagle rose up and he caught the inspiration so Isaiah's prophecy wasn't his prophecy it wasn't brother bram's Revelation The Book of Revelations wasn't John's prophecy but it was God's prophecy it was God telling John what's about to be poured out in the end time but God sends you a prophet God sends you a message not with his own understanding not with his own ideas but he raises up in that spiritual realm and he grabs that understanding then becomes down here and begins to tell us notice he begins to tell us what's happening in this hour so we're going to kind of look at some of this now if y'all don't mind we're going to go there but look before we look at this let's look in Luke 21-25 that clock needs to turn backwards mercy no wonder brother Tim can preach two hours when you teaching it feels good notice Luke 21:25 and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distressed upon on nations with per perplexity in the sea and the waves roaring men's Hearts failing them for fear and for looking at those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then notice and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth nigh so Jesus is telling them that when you begin to see these things come to pass don't be fearful don't be worried just look up what is he saying look away from the chaos look away from the corruption look away from the civil unrest look away and look up cuz your Redemption begins to draw n and if you can have the spiritual eyesight to see what's coming the hour in which we're living in that modern events are being made clear by prophecy it's just telling you again look up Church look up little bride I'm coming I'm on my way I'm going to Rapture you and change your body look up cuz Final Redemption the full adoption is at hand amen hallelujah brother said now how can a messenger sent from God just believe some of the scriptures and not all the word and not part of it a true prophet of God will proclaim the word in the last days denominations will hate him he will pull no punches on him he will be like it was at the first coming of Christ you Generation of Vipers but the predestinated the predestinated will hear and will make make ready for the countdown oh Hallelujah the Royal seed regardless for he was predestinated the messenger of Malachi 4 brother says in the spoken word is the Original Seed the messenger of Malachi 4 will appear at God's appointed time amen notice remember hca's Vision the vision is for an appointed time and though it tar wait for it it will speak and will not tar he says which is the time now for to see it he will be correctly dedicated to the word as they've always been indicated by God's word and Vindicated God will vindicate what he preaches to be the truth and he did as Elijah for it is Elijah coming making ready for the Mount Zion Rapture Jesus said in the last days it would be like like lot's time he's preaching his preaching will be the spirit and strength line of God's word because so much of God's truth many will misunderstand this true Messenger he goes I got to wrot here prophecy p r o p he e c y prophecy because look so much has been called God's truth by fakers and many true ministers will misunderstand that message but as a first Forerunner came in the wilderness Behold the Lamb the second Forerunner comes Behold the Lamb of God what's he said he said he's pointing you to a word born bride now there will be such brother says there will be such denominational a denom inational Gathering pretty soon so now we're going to get into some of the prophecies or some of the Mysteries some of the things that we're going to finalize the rest of our message on today and I may hold you about another four hours is that okay that's perfect okay good but we notice now what we're about to go into and what we're about to see this doesn't happen in full sunlight but this begins to take place under the cover of Darkness because now Christ has been rejected the message is has been rejected and notice that's back in 1960 so now we're here in 2024 we're some 50ish 60 years from that moment of the indictment where they rejected the word rejected the message and it's only man has only grow further and further and further into darkness and now we begin to see even now even as it's being played out on the political sides of things we see the hour in which we're living in so notice he says there will be such a denominational gall pretty soon it will be terrific they will bring themselves together into this Federation of churches that's right see it's at the time that Jesus will appear he will show which is bride and which is not and remember Christian friends I'm a man I make mistakes but God being God he cannot make a mistake all the words that's been written must be fulfilled Jesus said so so we look here in the way of a true Propet he says look what we're trying to do everything took place in the Dark Age he says unite the church and state together this is in 1963 they're trying to unite the church and state together he said look at the union the World Council of churches all the churches going into this world Council of churches they think this is Oneness of god notice they think this is the Oneness of God because all the Churches United Brethren men of the fundamental churches go into great one big great organization but that that's because the lacking of knowing the word of God because they rejected Christ they rejected the prophet they rejected the message now because of that now they accept this we're going into one great big organization we're all one bism he says notice now the prophets spoke that this thing would take place they' make an image unto the Beast and it would have power to speak so one of the s signs of gross darkness is the rejecting of Christ and it is the formulation or the uniting of church and state the uniting takes place under gross darkness in the hour of Darkness because man has rejected their messenger churches uniting together in the world Council of churches under the leadership of man amen not under the leadership of the holy spirit so notice Revelations 13 let's turn there in verse 11 Revelations 13 and verse 11 we're going to look at what brother bam would call the boycott how many's familiar with the boycott all right there's a handful so we need to be refreshed on these things right come on smile on your face today it's Sunday God loves you I love you amen hopefully your wife and your spouse loves you well God this is it's great to be a Christian in this hour great to be a believer Hallelujah now he says now Revelations 13:11 and behold another Beast coming up out of the Earth had two horns like a lamb and it spake as a dragon and he exercises all the power of the first Beast before him and he causes the Earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first Beast whose deadly wound was healed and he doeth great wonders so that he maketh Fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men he deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth by the means of those Miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the Beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they which should make an image to the Beast which had the wound By The Sword and did live and he had power to give life unto the image of the Beast and that the image of the Beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the Beast should be killed and he callused all both small and great rich and poor free and bomb to receive a mark in their right hand and in their for foreheads and that no man might bu ourselves save he that which had the Mark or the name of the Beast or the number of his name and here is the wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the Beast for it is the number of man and his number is 6003 score and six now I'll tell you when I was a kid I didn't go looking in this chapter Man mark of the beast what and some of you today are still wondering what's the mark of the beast H they going to put a chip in my my wrist they going to put a chip you know you got people today they got chips in their wrist I mean we can chip a dog I ain't no dog that's right but the mark of the beast ain't a chip in the hand and we're going to go into these things but brother Bram GL clearly tells because this chapter shows the power of the Roman Catholic church so I want you to place these things in order why are we here how do we get to Revelations 13 because they rejected the word and now we're in darkness and these things begin to be uncovered they begin to be made manifest they begin to be done under the cover of the darkness amen he says now this is the power of the Roman Catholic church and what she will do through the organization remember this is the false bind let it in the name of the Lord it does so only in a li it's the head its headship is not the Lord but Satan it finally ends up completely identified with the Beast the riding on the Scarlet Beast distinctly shows her power notice her power is the god of force Satan and not of God the Lord Jesus Christ then he goes into in verse 17 if we look in verse 17 there it says that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark and the N the name of the Beast or the number of his name and brother Bram says it emphatically shows that she will gain absolute control of Commerce of the Earth for no man can buy or sell apart from her this is born out of Revelations 18 veres 9-1 17 which shows her involvement with the Kings and princes and Merchants of all whom have to do with Rome and commerce so let's jump in Revelations 18 and verse 9 we're not going to read all these verses I just want to jump and here hit a few of them it says and the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and live deliciously with her shall bewell her and lament for her when they shall see the smoke of her burning so we understand that these Kings these Merchants have committed fornication they have laid with her in her bed of Affliction and things of that nature look here in verse 15 and The Merchant of these things if you go back before verses between verses 14 and 10 you begin to find all these merchants of spices and gold and all these different things and he says now the merch of these things which were made Rich by her shall stand AAR off for the fear of her torment weeping and wailing and brother Ram goes into the th tyan Church age and he says Revelations 13 and verse4 they made an image unto the Beast and I guess you're all reading that if you haven't why he goes we'll turn right back and read it he deceived them that dwell on the Earth by the means of those Miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the Beast he said that that's the confederation of the church so the image of the Beast is the confederation of the church to do it in the sight of the Beast saying unto them that dwell upon the Earth that they should make an image unto the Beast which had a deadly wound which is paganism was a wound by a sword and did live through papacy Pagan Rome to Papa Rome he says when Pagan Rome become Pap roome it never ceased the system of romanism ceased when a new king come he set up new order but when they come into Pagan Rome become Papa Rome through the Catholic Church through papalism it never ceases one Pope dies they set up another Pope and set up another Pope and keep setting up another Pope he said the Beast which was and is and yet shall come he said it shall go into predition he said that's thus saith the Holy Spirit through the scriptures they never cease so Rome had a religious system who deadly wound was healed that's right or the the deadly wound killed him in his head but he was revived again from Pagan Rome to Papa Rome and now they're to make an image to it out of the Beast that comes up out of Revelations 13 He said did you ever notice the nation is numbered or this nation is number 13 don't say he says now I know it's strange though it it would happen mathematically he says just exactly order with the scripture it's found in the 13th chapter of Revelation this nation all the beasts come up out of the water which is thickness and multitudes of people he says but this little beast come up out of the Earth where where there was no people yet he was a lamb freedom of religion then he spake like a dragon and United himself with the power and done all that the dragon did before him exactly just got to be that way no other way of getting around it and in verse 15 we find he gave power to give life unto the Beast or to the image of the Beast that the image of the Beast should both speak and cause as many that would not worship the image that they should be killed and brother bam says in the 10 virgins he said the image of the Beast is the Protestant denomination not the Catholic he said this is America he's speaking of here because chapter 13 is America the Beast that comes up out he says that all the Beast come up out of water which means thickness and multitudes of people but this Beast here comes up like a lamb out of the ground where there was no people it had two horns then it spoke like a dragon and they had an image of the Beast that was like in Europe and it made it he said it made this over here in the image it said a uniting of churches together and making this Protestant fellowship and then they forced all the other churches they couldn't even buy or sell anything else without they first become an image for the Beast all right we'll keep going he says we tried to make everybody become Lutheran and they couldn't do it we tried to make them all become Baptists and we couldn't do it all become method is all Pentecostal and they couldn't do it so in order to do this the time is so short they formed a councel a head an image to the beast that's exactly what they've done and what is it the crucifixion of the word again is at hand so now we we're seeing how it ties in how we get to this point because they crucified the word of God aresh and it's done under Darkness now he says he says so in the message what shall I do what Jesus called Christ what is this what is this system it's a satellite to Rome did the Bible say would be that way yes sir Revelation 17 they saw Rome rise up itself in an ecclesiastical system of a woman a woman or church is always represented by a woman so in Revelations 13:14 we learn that the Beast spreads his influence through the image which was built for him the image that is made is a worldwide ecumenical Council am where in all the organized churches will get together with the Roman Catholics they are doing it even now amen this is in the church age this is in the tharan church age it is quite possibly this Union will come in order to stop the power of Communism now maybe they formulated to stop communism but that's not their full intent we're going to get into the full intent but notice since communism like Nebuchadnezzar had been raised up to burn the flesh of the Harlot Rome will be overcome and destroyed take note that everywhere the Roman Church went communism followed it is it has to be that way let me warn you now don't think communism is your only enemy no sir it's the Catholic Church Revelations 13 and verse 16 he Calles all both small and great and poor and free and bond to receive the mark that's in the right hand or in their foreheads and if you don't have this Mark then you can't buy you can't sell say that you have the Mark or the name of the Beast or the number of his name so we got a few things in the scripture brother B says must be fulfilled and this is one of those things this is the boycott to come now this just couldn't happen in 1960 it couldn't happen when America was flourishing under the healing Revival and the word of God was being manifested and people were inspired at the time to serve the Lord Lord but now since they rejected it it all begins to happen under the cover of Darkness he says now notice but before this boycott can come of the marking of the Beast so the boycott you can't buy or sell comes and he calls a boycott is the marking of the Beast there has to be a seed sewed for God to take the church out of it he says now they asked brother bamman question and answers and they said is it NRA he said no that's not the mark of the beast certainly not it's a religious boycott so the boycott is a religious boycott or the mark of the beast is a religious boycott he says now brother BR he says speak on the mark of the beast don't you believe that they'll tattoo a number on your head or tattoo something on your hand he says no sir don't you never look for that it'll be a boycott certainly no man can buy our sell unless he he belongs to the confederation of churches that's true that'll come like a union union unionizing the thing bringing it down unionized religion mark my word it ain't far off and you'll see it just he says she's just around the corner so we're talking about this has been preached in 1954 so now as a prophet he's caught up and he's seeing these things he's forewarning us he's telling us of the Covenant he's begin to go back into Daniel and see that the Covenant that the prince makes we're going to go into some of that this morning he said notice here this is in the exposition of the church ages the false Church groups will come together in a world Council of churches This World Council of churches is the image erected to the beast that's right so don't get scared don't get fearful we're not in that image and we're not in the confederation of churches he says now remember it was Imperial Pagan Rome that fell by the sword but she was healed of her Deathstroke when she joined the nominal Church Christian Church of Rome and Incorporated paganism with Christianity amen thereby became the Holy Roman Empire which was to endure until Jesus came and destroy him but Rome is not going at it alone her daughters are right with her and she will take over absolute Authority by the World Council of churches this may seem far-fetched to some but actually it's very plain for all that see because now right now the churches are controlling politics right so now he preaches this this is in the church age so now he's going to show us where only a prophet can pick these things out and place Us in time of how these things are happening and why they happen and how they happen and he says it's happening right now because the churches are controlling the politics do you think your vote counts he said this ecumenical move will end end up with Rome at the head even though the people did not Envision it that way this is so because in Revelation 17 and verse3 it states that the mystery Babylon is Seated on the Beast she's controlling the last or the fourth Empire this Roman Church is doing that with the word the World Church system under her Rome will be controlling and this image the church system will be obedient to Rome because Rome controls the gold of the world amen so we're going to look at the mark of the beast and so we have an understanding some of you young people you may want to write this down so you don't have to be worried about getting a tattoo in your hand in your forehead he says thus he said the people have belonged to the World Church are to be at the mercy of the elements for they cannot buy or sell without the mark of the beast in the hand or the head now this Mark in the head means that you will have to take the doctrine of the World Church system which is the trinitarian system father son holy Ghost and the mark in the hand which means to do the will of the World Church now not who's that the head of the World Church wrome the Catholic okay we're good there he says with this great power of the church system will persecute the true bride the image will try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching Etc her ministers will be forbidden to give comfort and Truth to the people who need it but before the Antichrist in person and takes over the complete World System of churches the true church will be taken away from this world to be with the Lord God will catch away his bride for the great marriage supper of the Lamb so we understand that that prophecy has to be fulfilled but at the same time that that's taking place the bride will already be lifted off here will already be sitting at a Mary supper of the Lamb we don't have anything to fear church but I want you to see how these things begin to to manifest they manifest under the cover of Darkness we find here in 2 Thessalonians 2 the Bible says let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first that the man of sin be revealed the son of predition who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he as God sth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God drop down to verse 7 for the mystery of iniquity doeth already work only he who now lth will let until he be taken out of the way and then shall that Wicked one be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power signs and lying wonders but the mystery of iniquity doeth already work only he who now L us will let until he be taken out away when the bride is taken up then that Wicked one will be thoroughly revealed that's right but we don't have to worry we that got the Holy Ghost let me say you better take inventory if you don't you that don't have the Holy Ghost you don't have the Assurance of the baptism of the Holy Ghost not just on your flesh not just jumping and shouting and screaming and jumping and saying Amen to the word I'm talking about having the the token life on the inside of you you better make sure you got it so you can escape the wrath that's coming this ain't no time to be playing church and just believing God sent a prophet you better have that messenger that life that token on the inside notice here he says now here is the wisdom in Revelations 13 and: 18 here is the wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the Beast for it is the number of man and his number is 63 scoring six that's right now you go over here in Revelations 13 it shows you that this man sits on a city he said the number of the beasts is 666 he goes WR that out in Latin the Roman alphabet 666 is vicarious fadia which is instead of the Son of God on the Pope's Throne so on the Pope's Throne it says instead of the Son of God vicarius Fila 666 takes a Prophet that's why we started this series off with the foundation of a prophet it takes a prophet to bring liken to these things so we can see exactly where the false prophet is exctly where the Antichrist is where the Beast is and where we are in time so he says here now and his chair has got a Triple Crown he says he opposes himself above all that's called God all The Godly men he's the holiest of all of them sets in the temple of God just show showing himself that he is God forgiving sins of the earth and so forth he goes you know for sure he says now I want you to notice as soon as the king he start talking about Nebuchadnezzar he said when the king saw the vision he erected an image into that vision and he had all man worshiped that image and he said the Gentile dispensation came in with image worship and he said it'll go out with image worship all right he says now I'm going to say something here it's not a Doctrine I'm just prophesying you know what happen it's going to come to place soon mark my word that all denominations are going to have to join The ecumenical council if they don't they can't have a support of the council they'll not be there'll be a boycott nobody can go to these churches or go to any churches unless you have the mark of your own church or mark from your your own church you cannot by or sell he goes you see it's just as it was so it's going to happen again a marking of the Beast so we see that Mark that the mark of the Beast isn't receiving a chip in the hand or in the head it's not having a number tattooed on you but it's belonging to the ecuminical council so and he says now this this takes place this takes place under the cover of Darkness so we find that it takes a prophet to come on the scene and to begin to reveal these great truths to us we believe that so let's look here what the Roman Catholic page says the website says in regard to the pope cuz you tell somebody that the pope is the Antichrist I'm like there ain't no way there ain't no way he's the most religious man in all the world look at he's an old grandpa but Papa Supremacy is the doctrine of the Catholic church that the pope by reasoning of his office as viker of Christ instead of Christ viker of Christ the visible source and foundation of the unity both of the Bishops and the whole compan of faithful as a pastor of the entire Catholic church has full Supreme and Universal power over the whole church power which he can always exercise unhindered the pope enjoys by Divine institution Supreme full immediate Universal Power in the cares of souls the pope stands in the place of Jesus himself as the viker of Christ on Earth he is the head of the Catholic Church and her nearly 1.3 billion Catholics and is responsible for the Salvation of all the souls throughout the entire world no one will consider this Pope NOS this no one will consider this Pope to be the son of predition I me he's got the souls of 1.3 billion people in his hands he ain't no way he's a bad guy but a prophet comes and identifies who he is so let's look at this ecumenical counsel if we could just for a little bit this morning this phrase communal council is defined as a council of religious churches that is called periodically to ensure that they are abiding by a single set of doctrines it's headed up by the Roman Catholic Church the main purpose of the eunic council are to maintain a single set of doctrines for Christianity throughout the world and keep minority religious groups from breaking away from the large Christian body the meaning of ecumenical is a promotion of unity and agreement between the various churches that espouse Christianity but doesn't the Bible say how can two walk together unless they be agreed but now all these churches are walking together in agreement in the world Council thus the ecumental council are councils meant to resolve differences between various Christian denominations this reflects the belief of the Catholic church that the decisions of these councils were Val throughout the world thus The ecumenical council of churches is a council that represents all Christians throughout throughout the world and it's headed up by the Catholic church so in Jezebel religion Bel says now then one day after sin had took its toll God had brought his people to their knees Jezebel took every took over everything she wiped it all up she'll do it again that's thus sayith the Holy Bible she'll do it again she's right on the throne now behind the Figure Head see brother Brandon was making a reference to JFK being the first Catholic President but notice he was a Catholic President so he's saying Jezebel is now on the throne notice he's only Jeff K was only the figurehead of this then he goes and he says further down he says look now Israel got how they floated with the tide till finally Jezebel come look how America got and floated with the worldly tide until finally Jezebel took the throne now Jezebel actually wasn't on the throne of Egypt or Israel but she was the main head behind the throne and the Catholic hierarchy not on the is not on the throne of the United States of the United States but she's the system behind it because he's married to her and the Bible said in this country they'll make an image liken unto the Beast and brother BR talks about the pope he says notice he goes for the things now one thing is to unite the Protestant and the Catholic church together to an intellectual person that seems like that would be something to do right let's unite everybody together we need to just be be one great Christian body and you know we're going to overcome communism we're going to we're going to overcome the threat of muslimism and all these different other kind of uh beliefs out there in the land he says but notice to the Natural man the Antichrist is growing now through politics he's already got the White House in religion he's got all the people so scrupled up to actually they fall right for it and the denominational leaders practically every church that there is in the nation is already in the confederation of church rameses is growing they're all uniting together that's what they have and what he says and what does it what does it do he said it makes power the Beast just like the first one so JFK was the first Catholic President Joe Biden's the second Catholic President Catholics make up 29.8% of the members of Congress that's 158 members out of 531 members of serving in our Congress today it's our Supreme Court six out of the nine justices are Catholic the largest percent of the Congress is Catholic notice Protestants make up or the largest percent is Protestants but they're divided up between so many different fractions or or different beliefs therefore that gives the Catholic Church the majority of Congress and gives them a unified voice to pass laws so how is this boy C coming she's controlling the politics but said now notice it'll be slick and slide until it would deceive the very elected if it was possible then he says in Daniel 9 and verse 27 let's go there 9 and 27 I'm going to do my best have you out of here by 1:30 Daniel 9:27 and he shall come confirmed a covenant with many for a week we're going to stop right there brother says I hope that the people are spiritual I have a horrible he goes I would have made a horrible mistake on this now I'm coming out of the first seal here so I think it's pertinent that we look at that it wasn't just a man's idea when he starts bringing these things down now we find and we give Credence to the Holy Spirit he says this is in the first seal I hope that the people are spiritual he goes I would have made a horrible mistake on that if I hadn't been at about 12:00 today when the Holy Spirit came in the room and corrected me on some things that I was writing down notice he was going to go from some old context but the Lord came down and begin to give him the understanding of the first seal which is the white horse rider who it is that was riding on that horse and what his intentions are so we're going to find that through the rest of this service he says now and after the three score in two weeks shall Messiah be cut off that's the three score in two weeks he'll be cut off out of the 70 weeks not for himself but for the people and the prince that's the hierarchy talking about the Church Catholic Church shall come and shall come and destroy the city the sanctuary the end thereof shall be with great flood and unto the end of the war desolations will be determined he goes after Christ was cut off from the earth in the three and a half years of his ministry and what destroyed the temple or who destroyed the temple Rome he said Titus the Roman general he destroyed the prince and when Jesus was born the red dragon in heaven stood at the woman to devour her child as soon as it was born is that right who tried to Devour the child Rome so we're trying to play some things for you he says there's the red dragon there's your prince here's your Beast so that notice we but we find in in Daniel 9:27 there's a covenant that is being made and we're going to look into this in the first seal brother man goes into it he says now I believe I preached this long long back he said but it'll happen to the United States on this money situation we are paying our debts on taxes that'll be paid 40 years from now that's how far we are behind I'm going to try to slow down here to bring this out thoroughly he says we are completely busted that's all what's the matter the gold is all house up the Jews hold the bonds it's going to be Rome now watch we know who owns the department stores Revelations 18-9 the kings of the Earth the Jews don't own the department stores but the kings of the Earth the merchants said we know who owns the department stores but Rome has the greatest part of the world of the world the rest of it the Jews have now watch this just listen this is how the Holy Spirit brought it to me this is in the first seal this is not brother brandham as a man now he's caught the inspiration to bring this to us he said he shall confirm the Covenant with the many for one week now watch he said in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice of the obla to seize for the overspreading of abomination he shall make it desolate even unto the consummation that the time determined shall be poured out upon the desolate who goes oh watch what a shrewd thing he is he said he is here now we got our picture we know it's wrome he said excuse me we know he's the right horse rider we know that he went forth as a Doctrine then what was was Pagan Rome converted to Papa Ro and he's crowned he said but in the midst in the early days when Christ was preaching he said but he says now notice it's not in the early days when Christ was preaching but in the end time the last part of the week he says that's where we just took the 70 weeks of Daniel and Christ was prophesy for three and 1/2 years and there the three and 1/2 years are yet to be determined and in this time the the prince in this time is to make a covenant with Daniel's people which is the Jews that's when the bride's taken out she won't see it come on Brian I know I'm talking to you about the darkness but I'm telling you you're not part of the darkness he says the last one and a half of Daniel's weeks this Prince makes a covenant with Rome makes a covenant with them no doubt for the wealth for the Catholic and the Jews hold the wealth of the world so why is the covenant made for the wealth of the world so let's just kind of look at the history of the relationship between Rome and Israel for a few minutes if we can the relationship between the Catholics and the Jews is marred by centuries of troubles including doctrinal pics Crusade era massacres forc Exiles of the Jews notice there's been a hatred down through history of the romes and the Jews I mean a despising of one another Jewish Roman tensions resulted in several Jewish Roman wars between the years of 66 and 135 CE which resulted in the destruction of Jerusalem and the second temple and the institution of the Jewish taxs in 70 BC I suppose he says Romans destroyed much of the temple in Jerusalem According to some accounts plunder the artifacts from the temple such as a manora and from 63 BC until the Jewish war of 66 Israel was under the roome was under Roman control but in 1965 I want you to see this in 1965 now your Prophet begins that's his last year of his life but in 1965 the Vatican moved to improve relationships with with Jews notice it did not recognize him as a formal state in 1948 or 1949 it didn't even recognize him as a formal state in 1965 but it did in 1993 but it began to prove excuse me to improve the excuse me it began to improve the relations that it had in 1965 because the Jews hold the bonds they hold the other part of the world or the riches of the world in their hand so you see the Vatican now they're making the move I want you to see this they're making to move to position thems with good ties with the Jews so they can make this Covenant so in December 1993 the Vatican and Israel signed a diplomatic treaty how many of you knew that okay they signed a diplomatic treaty they exchang embassadors a few months later and the Vatican Israel agreement normalized relations between the two two Nations further it furthered a Jewish Catholic dialogue already underway and helped establish a path for regularizing the church's legal status in Israel notice the church's status in Israel so you see The Mastermind behind it all is the church the Vatican they're trying to improve the relations they're trying to position thems with an agreement come on church trying to show you where these things happen they don't happen in broad daylight but they happen under the cover of darkness and he says now overall the vatican's relationship with Israel is based on their international law and not theology that's right so it has nothing to do with religion at all international law so we see from this that the church is the one that's making the efforts to improve the relationship with Israel and there's an underlying reason for that and all seems Innocent but the great has a reason notice brother makes a statement he goes I got to go to the Vatican he says why you couldn't buy it with a hundred billion dollar the wealth of the world was found in her but he says but after the church is taken away Rome and the Jews will make a covenant one with another after the church is taken away we will not be there you have no reason to fear but you can start seeing them things starting to fall into place so because we can see these things starting to you know right now my family is putting a probably a 1500 piece puzzle together yeah some of you would Bri like yeah I just look over there it's like there's two pieces missing but they're putting this big puzzle together and it's all scattered out and you should see the excitement in the home when they put one little piece in one spot oh yeah because they know that the completion of that puzzle is getting closer to fulfillment each and every time they find the piece that's missing what am I telling you whoa come on believer come on bride when we see the pieces of the puzzle begin to fit into place we know that the puzzle is about to be finished we know let me tell you it ain't to scare you but now we can see the picture what's all been broke up over time what's all been little fragments and pieces is now coming into one Great Piece we can see the church in our system we can see The ecumenical council and we can see why the Israel and the Jews are trying to the churches trying to formulate a covenant with Israel because they want the wealth of the world but let me tell you this Pride won't be here I take come on somebody this prbe won't be here we're going to be gone we're going to leave this world behind because the puzzle is going to be put together there's been a prophecy not only concerning this but at that time let me tell you this little bride will not go through the tribulation period woo he says Rome and the Jews will make a covenant one with another the Bible said they would with the holy people and now notice they'll make it because why the nation is going to be busted he said this nation is going to be busted the rest of the world that's on the gold standard is busted he because if we're living off taxes do bills for 40 years now where are we at there's only one thing can happen that's to call in the currency and pay off the bonds and we can't do it to pay off the currency to call in the bonds who owns the bonds who owns the Securities the Jews own the bonds they own Wall Street don't you see how plays in they own the Jew the Jews on Wall Street and we can't pay off this debt but tell you they're going to call it in and the Roman Catholic Church is going to be the one that pays off the debt and enter into that Covenant oh but brother and sister we going to be out of here we're going to be gone how many knows what the national debt is I know $35 trillion do now some of you can't think that big that's a lot of zeros somebody said I can I don't know who said that notice the national day is the amount of money the federal government has borrowed to cover outstanding balance and expenses over time by selling bonds and securities and the Jews Wall Street they own it that's who we're in debt to church but there's got to be a time there's going to make a call on that debt and what we can't pay it but somebody's going to pay it notice here simply put we find here that the national debt is the accumulation of this borrowing Al with the associated interest owed to his investors who purchased these Securities so the federal government is experiencing reoccurring deficit which is common the national debt grows simply put the national debt is no different than a person using a credit card for purchases and not paying off the full balance each month you just pay the interest but yet it keeps growing and growing and growing and growing and growing notice the cost of the purchase exed see the amount paid off represents a deficit while accumulated deficits over time represents a person's overall debt the 35 trillion is roughly the economies of China India Germany Japan and the United Kingdom all combined together did you hear that the combined the combined debt 35 trillion is China's economy India's economy Germany's economy Japan's economy and the United Kingdom's economy all combined together that's two $266,000 per household or $104,000 per individual that lives in the United States how many of you got a small baby here this morning that baby owes $104,000 to the national debt didn't didn't pay nothing didn't buy nothing didn't look at nothing but owes $114,000 and they said now within 10 years the federal government will spend more on interest payments than it traditionally has on research and development infrastructure education and we're spending $2 billion a day on interest payments without even touching the principal how we going to do this how we going to pay it off we hear about this national debt and this national debt and this national debt and we don't think anything about it but it plays right here into the prophecy it plays right here into the prophecy it has to grow he says now notice the rich merchants of the earth hold it and then there's only one thing to do the Catholic church can pay it off she's the only one that's got the money she can do it she will do it and doing this she'll compromise notice and in doing this she will compromise with the Jews and make a covenant and when she makes the Covenant with the Jews now remember I'm taking this from the scriptures now when she does this makes this Covenant we notice in Daniel 8:23 and 25 he will cause craft to prosper manufacturing at his hand he makes this Covenant with the Jews and in the midst of the three and 1/2 years he breaks this Covenant as soon as he gets the thing wrapped up and gets the money of the Jews tied up he's going to hold the money and that's where I think he'll come in he's talking about the Beast so when he gets the money all under control then he'll break this Covenant with the Jews as Daniel said here it would be in the midst of the the the last half of the 70 weeks of Daniel he will have all the world trade and commerce the and a pack with the world cuz he will hold the wealth of the world completely and he says excuse me and during this time there'll be two prophets rise on the scene they called the 144,000 he says thank God the church will be joining at this time of three and a half years in glory we don't have to go through it l that's from your Prophet don't have to go through it and notice when the church is taken up Satan has come down he goes then in Revelations 13 He sets a mark down the boycott you can't buy or sale because now he owns the wealth of the world see what does this Mark it's joining the World Council of churches let me bring this down to a close here in just a few minutes remember the Antichrist in the Beast is a self-same spirit there's the Trinity three stages first stage he's the Antichrist second stage he's the false prophet third stage he's called called the beast notice first stage he's called the Antichrist talked about that Nick and spirit that was Crown second stage he's called the false prophet and brother BR says the pope with the false word is the false prophet then he said the third stage then he's Crown when this is taken off when the bride is gone then he's crowned Beast notice the third stage is a beast a man that's crowned in the last days with every Power that Pagan Rome ever had because the seven-headed Beast Dragon was cast out of Heaven Come incarnate in the false prophet and here it is he had seven crowns he was cast out and throw into the Earth W who is this Rider he said this horse rider you know who it is is Satan's Superman see the world brother man says the world's been wanting a Superman he said this riter is nothing but Satan's Superman the Incarnate Devil he's an educated genius the world's wanting a Superman a man that can stop Wars a man that can feed a hungry across the world a man that can ify the people in the day a man that can bridge the gap between heterosexuals and homosexuals a man that can provide Financial stability to people around the world let me give you some of the current comments that Pope Francis has made just so you can see how even their dialogue and their thinking begins to kind of fit the scale of Satan Superman he says all Christians must reaffirm the Dignity of every human being all Christians must reaffirm the the Dignity of every human being notice that sounds good doesn't it otherwise you got to be tolerant of every man's belief whether he's a homosexual whether he's not whether he's transgender whether he's not we must notice reaffirm the Dignity of every human being otherwise be tolerant of what they believe clean energy requires renewable resources and responsible consumption now what does a pastor or a pope a religious leader have to deal with clean energy don't you see the clean energy movement that's right now underline right here in the United States of America by 2030 I believe it is that we're supposed to be 100% on electric power by 2030 we supposed to be 100% on elect do you not understand what that's going to do to our nation my my daughter Lauren and I we work for a trucking company they want to even have the big 18wheeler semis to be all be on electric power those things can only go 300 miles on electric power and it takes 36 hours to fully recharge that thing back up so you're telling me we're going travel is going to increase you're telling me we're going to fix the world economy at least in the United States with electric power there's a push down there it's something that's being done under the cover of Darkness yet at the same time that this is happening in America we're going green all the other countries of the world are buying up our automobiles they're buying up our 18 wers they're buying these things up in grows because they they don't dance to the same tune of the image of the Beast has rose up out of America these are things that's happening parts of the puzzle fitting in place when you read these things and hear these things on the news just put it in there it's fulfilling prophecy modern events are being made clear by prophecy notice my goodness I promise I'm I'm I'm starting to land I just put the wheels out all right we're going to land this thing here in just a minute M goodness notice educated this Satan Superman with education and wisdom with church Theology of his own word in his own making he rides with the white denominational horse to deceive the people every denomination is struck right into it the Federation of churches what's backing at Rome the Pope's now crying we're all one let's come together and walk together so let's look here what members of the denominations are part of this World Council of churches Orthodox churches Eastern and Oriental as well as African instituted angan Aryan the Baptist Evangel Evangelical uh Lutheran minonite Methodist Mor morvan or something like that old Catholic Pentecostals reformed United uniting and free independent churches Disciples of Christ and friends and Quakers so there's all kinds there's 352 denominations right now it's all wrapped up in it with over 500 million people that's wrapped up in this whole Confederation of churches and brother BR says it's the same prostitute institution the next thing church is the rapture of the church and I'll bring this down to a close notice he'll conquer and almost has in his grip right now while he's still the Antichrist before he can come and becomes Beast you talk about cruel punishment you just wait watch then what's left on the earth that will go right through with the he said there will be a weeping and wailing and ntion of teeth for the red dragon Rome spurted out water out of her mouth to make war with the rant of the woman seed that was left upon the Earth after the bride has been selected and took out after the bride has been selected and took out and the dragon made war with the remnant that didn't want to come in and was hunted down and the real church will go through that if it was possible oh but praise God praise God it's impossible for the real church for she will not be deceived musicians if you would come notice now and the real Church would go through that if it was possible but you know they've done it under the blood they're under the blood of the grace of Christ and it's not going through have no tribulation period the next thing for the church is the rapture that's prophecy so when you can see these other pieces of the puzzle falling into place you got to see the most important piece of the puzzle for you regarding your place that's the Rapture of the church notice let me bring this down here he goes now let's not give the Satan all the credit here we go I'm bringing you out I'm bringing you back to light not GNA leave you in this Darkness he goes now watch at the same time this gu's conquering he goes then I'll close I'm he goes God's going to do something then let's not get gives Satan all the credit and her with her money of the Jews in the Covenant the Bible said he goes it'll take the whole thing and then he becomes a bees he breaks his Covenant he ravages he tears out the rest of the woman's sea like that and spurts water out of his mouth makes War then there be weeping and wailing and nashing and teeth and the brid in glory getting married oh come on little bride we're not

a moment in the twinkling of an eye and God sends us a prophet to vindicate this word not only to vindicate it but bring the inspiration behind it to show us what to look forward to Malachi not Malachi Matthew 10:41 he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet receives a prophet's reward and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward brother bam says they asked him I like to know about Matthew 10:41 I like to know what is a prophet's reward how many you like to know what that is a prophet's reward we believe a message of a prophet there's got to be a reward for believing the message right he goes now whoever receives a prophet in the name of a prophet receives a prophet's reward a prophet's reward is to be a friend with the prophet whosoever receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man receives a righteous man's reward is that right if they want to know what a prophet's reward is is to be a friend to the prophet that's the reward he's your friend oh Church you say well brother Joe I never met the prophet I never met brother brandham that doesn't matter his message his message is your friend his message is to help you not hurt you his message is to Enlighten you to bring you to the truths of the Bible not to dis discredit you not to point you into a world Council of of churches to receive a prophet is to receive his reward of becoming his friend he climbs up in the fear of Supernatural and he brings back the revelations that John has the revelations of Isaiah the revelations of the inspiration of all these other prophets and he comes down and he shares them with us thus that's why we must have a Vindicated Prophet before the end time can come so what's the last sign what's the last sign there going to be a prophet in the land and what is he going to do he's going to discern the very thoughts and intents of the heart he's going to make known the scriptures but he's going to discern he's going to turn the hearts of the people back to the father we're living Church in the hour of fulfillment I pray that you're ready to meet him I pray that if you're not you'll inventory

anointing and grab that inspiration and begin to share what's going to happen and what's coming down but yet Lord before all those things can be fully manifested Lord he said this little bride is going to be taken up Lord it may be gross Darkness upon the land and gross Darkness is upon the people but Lord Isaiah would tell us Rise and Shine for the glory of the Lord has risen upon me Lord
