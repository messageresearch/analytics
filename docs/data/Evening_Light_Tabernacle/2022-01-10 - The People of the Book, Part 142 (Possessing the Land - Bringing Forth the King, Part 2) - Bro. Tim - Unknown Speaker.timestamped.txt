[23:45] let's talk to the lord now
[23:47] father we thank you today for your
[23:49] blessings to us
[23:51] oh god what grace you have given what
[23:54] mercies
[23:55] you bestowed upon us
[23:57] asking that you'll speak to our hearts
[23:59] lord
[24:00] one more time lord that you'd minister
[24:03] to the word
[24:05] we're just mortals that's all we are
[24:07] here standing in this flesh
[24:10] but there's an immortal life on the
[24:12] inside of us
[24:13] we have heard from eternity
[24:16] we have come from there and we're going
[24:19] back again
[24:20] i pray lord you'll bless us in a mighty
[24:22] way tonight
[24:23] and as we come to the communion service
[24:26] that you'll bless your people
[24:28] with your presence
[24:29] in the mighty way lord may we remind be
[24:32] reminded in the time of foot washing
[24:34] that we're here to serve to watch the
[24:36] dirt off and of another's foot
[24:39] lord to
[24:40] to encourage one another
[24:43] to serve you with all our hearts we ask
[24:46] it in jesus name
[24:48] amen
[24:49] and amen give me just a little more
[24:51] sound up here
[24:52] let's turn to joshua chapter 24 and
[24:55] verse 12 tonight
[24:57] i want to read from there if you will
[25:00] join with me in this
[25:02] this scripture reading tonight just
[25:05] remain standing for a moment
[25:07] and we always remember you know
[25:09] sometimes we
[25:11] we sometimes rejoice in the word
[25:13] sometimes we
[25:15] jump up and we
[25:16] we stand and we
[25:18] we will clap our hands
[25:20] but i want you to remember that's never
[25:22] to be done to a man
[25:24] that is to be done in honor to the lord
[25:27] jesus
[25:28] amen so just keep that in mind this is
[25:31] not about applauding a man
[25:33] what he said or what he didn't say
[25:36] or how he said it or you know something
[25:39] like that this is about
[25:41] amen giving an amen to the lord jesus
[25:43] and thanking him
[25:45] for the word is an amen that we're given
[25:48] amen so joshua chapter 24 verse 12
[25:52] and i sent the hornet before you which
[25:54] drayed them out from before you
[25:57] even the two kings of the amorites but
[26:00] not with thy sword nor with thy bow
[26:03] and i have given you a land for which
[26:05] you did not labor
[26:07] and cities which you built not
[26:10] and you dwelled in them and of the
[26:12] vineyards and the olive yards which he
[26:14] planted
[26:15] not do you eat now therefore
[26:19] fear the lord and serve him in sincerity
[26:21] and truth
[26:22] and put away the gods which your father
[26:25] served on the other side of the flood
[26:27] and in egypt and serve ye the lord amen
[26:31] god bless you
[26:33] as you are seated
[26:34] my we thank thank the lord for his
[26:36] goodness to us and
[26:38] what what mercy and grace that he has
[26:40] given
[26:41] i think in there as we was reading we
[26:44] have things that the lord has given to
[26:46] us that we didn't even work for
[26:49] i look at looking out over
[26:51] a carpet that was put out in the and the
[26:54] flooring in the fellowship hall and the
[26:56] different things that
[26:57] we didn't work for and we didn't pay for
[27:00] that it was paid for
[27:02] and and even the labor was given and the
[27:05] pews that you're sitting on
[27:07] a man that was given to us
[27:10] and the equipment that we use here for
[27:12] our um
[27:13] our audio here in the service
[27:16] and even even the cameras that we have
[27:19] and that the whole thing we didn't pay
[27:22] for them they were paid for by
[27:24] a man who's a christian man but a man
[27:27] i've never met even yet yet he's donated
[27:29] a couple hundred thousand dollars to the
[27:31] ministry
[27:32] and and sending out mission work and so
[27:35] on like that
[27:36] and he's a baptist believer but he loves
[27:39] jesus
[27:40] and so we we
[27:42] we certainly appreciate that very much
[27:45] and and i i think of things that we did
[27:47] not pay for that we did not have to do
[27:50] or work for at all with our hands
[27:53] and god has given it to us
[27:55] we're a blessed people
[27:57] amen even as i said the cameras for the
[28:00] internet and everything else you know
[28:02] it's god that that provided aren't you
[28:04] glad for a wonderful
[28:06] provider is our lord
[28:08] amen he provides as i said when we
[28:11] dedicated this building
[28:13] he's more than enough
[28:15] and he showed himself to us more than
[28:17] enough
[28:19] now as we're looking tonight we're going
[28:21] to continue our thought on possessing
[28:23] the land and
[28:25] and um bringing forth the king
[28:28] and i hope that you know where we got
[28:31] today that we can take on from here
[28:33] and i still got a ways to go so i hope
[28:35] that you still brought an appetite
[28:38] amen if you go to sleep i'll wake you up
[28:42] but i hope you don't go to sleep
[28:45] but as we just uh look you you you pull
[28:48] on the on the gift of god if you will
[28:51] now as we think about god in his
[28:55] provisions and what he's given us as um
[28:59] as
[29:00] we can look and say that we have been so
[29:02] blessed
[29:04] but yet we can't say like laodicea
[29:07] i'm rich and increased and
[29:09] with goods and i have
[29:10] everything but but joshua
[29:14] you know is is saying here um you know
[29:17] you you've been blessed and you've been
[29:19] given a lot of things
[29:21] and you've got a great land here
[29:24] but uh but there's still a lack and that
[29:27] luck is that you must
[29:29] you must come and really come in with
[29:32] sincerity and truth
[29:34] if you're going to completely possess
[29:36] this land
[29:38] and you know even sometimes though we
[29:40] might have thought we've already given
[29:42] our all i think we ought to examine
[29:44] ourselves tonight
[29:46] and look one more time a little deeper
[29:48] in our own selves
[29:50] get down to the depth of the soul
[29:53] because whatever i don't want to miss
[29:56] being a part of what god's doing
[29:58] and i do believe that he is finalizing a
[30:01] great work in this last day
[30:03] as the plan of redemption has rolled up
[30:07] right down to this very hour
[30:09] and it takes a sincerity it takes an
[30:12] honesty and a genuineness
[30:14] and honesty and and
[30:16] and um expression
[30:19] that should be
[30:20] sincerity is an honesty in the
[30:22] expression of a true or deep feeling
[30:26] and this is what joshua admonished the
[30:28] people who were inherited in the land
[30:30] saying it is truly it is truly a land
[30:34] that is flowing with milk and honey
[30:37] it is abundant in the blessings of god
[30:40] they all lay in that land
[30:42] and we we often just take a mere glance
[30:45] at the land and you know we think of it
[30:47] oh it was a land that had grass and
[30:50] places for cattle and there were farms
[30:52] and communities and towns and vineyards
[30:55] but it was much more than that
[30:58] laying in the land as we ended this
[31:00] morning on was the burying places of
[31:03] abraham isaac and jacob
[31:06] and there was a resurrection that was
[31:08] promised to them
[31:10] and this was the greatest milk and honey
[31:13] that is possible
[31:15] you see that there would be a
[31:16] resurrection and that the messiah would
[31:19] stand there this is the ultimate
[31:22] this is greater than places for cattle
[31:25] to to grow fat with plenty of food
[31:29] and peaceful lands an abundant wealth
[31:32] but oh what a wealth
[31:34] that laid in this land for in this land
[31:37] the messiah would come
[31:40] in this land the king would come forth
[31:43] the redeemer that would bring full
[31:45] redemption
[31:47] hallelujah i'll tell you we're living in
[31:49] the age as i feel the holy spirit move
[31:52] upon me
[31:53] amen that is that we're living in the
[31:55] age not a partial redemption
[31:58] but a full redemption
[32:00] amen of a resurrection where there will
[32:02] be an ascension where there'll be a
[32:05] people alive and remain at the coming of
[32:08] the lord who will not hinder those that
[32:10] are asleep
[32:12] we're living in one of the greatest
[32:14] hours that there's ever been on the face
[32:17] of the earth and you need not look back
[32:19] and say oh i wish i'd have been back
[32:21] there because i tell you you are in the
[32:24] greatest hour of this world's history
[32:27] right now
[32:29] they had disentered in here and they
[32:32] were inherited
[32:33] and then too often we look at the
[32:36] surface oh ah this is a great soil here
[32:39] to grow corn
[32:41] here a great olive trees and olive
[32:44] groves that have been planted and we can
[32:47] have oil
[32:48] and we can have peaceful fields for our
[32:51] cattle to grow and what would be a nice
[32:53] place to raise the children
[32:56] and and so we can have
[32:58] nice families and a nice church
[33:03] and we can offer sacrifices here
[33:06] but god was one to give them something
[33:08] much greater than that
[33:10] and i wanted to say you too have been
[33:13] blessed by receiving this message
[33:16] amen the word that we have inherited has
[33:20] given us great blessings
[33:22] you have wonderful things that god has
[33:24] blessed you with natural blessings
[33:27] that lay in this world there are natural
[33:30] blessings just that come just by
[33:32] following god's word
[33:34] you can have happy homes
[33:36] amen you can have good marriages you can
[33:39] have well-behaved children it's milk and
[33:42] honey
[33:43] that's what this word will produce
[33:45] amen it will produce uh uh you know a
[33:48] good church
[33:50] it'll produce lovely people
[33:52] it'll produce good singing
[33:55] come on it'll produce wonderful worship
[33:59] and man all of these things are
[34:01] wonderful and they're desirable and
[34:03] they're great and they're oh it's milk
[34:06] and honey
[34:07] but even in possessing all of that
[34:10] that's really not what god's wanting to
[34:12] give you
[34:13] hallelujah he's wanting to give you the
[34:16] resurrection
[34:18] of all the saints he's wanted to give
[34:20] you the change of your body he's wanting
[34:23] to bring about an ascension and that
[34:26] there be a rapture that'll take place in
[34:28] this age god wants to give you more than
[34:31] a good church
[34:33] amen a good community of believers
[34:36] among good nice people to be around and
[34:39] nice families to have and good children
[34:42] and i'll tell you the message produces
[34:43] all of that
[34:46] but god wanted to give more than that
[34:50] i heard a song the other day that just
[34:52] flashed back in my mind
[34:54] a gospel song that i don't know i think
[34:57] it was mark bishop that sang it i don't
[34:59] really know his singing but anyway i
[35:01] took note of it
[35:02] and was talking about lazarus
[35:05] where jesus wept
[35:07] and he said
[35:09] you know in the song the way that he
[35:10] brought it he didn't weep when he'd
[35:13] heard that lazarus died
[35:15] he didn't weep when he when he um walked
[35:19] even even just to see the tomb that he
[35:21] laid down in and and that that's what
[35:23] made him cry
[35:25] but in this song that it brought it out
[35:27] and i never thought of it like that and
[35:29] said but when he wept he wept because he
[35:32] had to bring him back
[35:36] amen really what god wants for us
[35:39] are you with me
[35:41] amen is to take us to his home to be
[35:44] with him forever
[35:46] to take us out of this old wretched life
[35:49] of mortality and take us into a life of
[35:52] immortality that's what god wants for
[35:54] his children
[35:59] all these things as i said are wonderful
[36:03] but god wants to give more
[36:05] it's a feast of milk and honey
[36:07] and there are more aspects of it
[36:10] it will help you with your finances
[36:13] i mean just the blessings of tithing
[36:16] those blessings that follows just that
[36:18] little principle
[36:20] the little simple things that god's word
[36:22] said about conducting your business and
[36:25] your finances
[36:26] just being a christian
[36:29] amen those things are wonderful but to
[36:32] achieve that is not to achieve the goal
[36:36] i hope you can see the picture that i'm
[36:38] trying to paint here amen i hope you can
[36:41] begin to see where my heart is today
[36:44] that's why i cannot be satisfied with
[36:46] having a good church
[36:49] a nice building plus pews
[36:52] like i said there are gifts of god that
[36:54] were given to us
[36:56] amen i have carpet on the floor and i
[36:58] have a nice building and all of that
[37:00] that that is
[37:02] dear god if that's our reward we're not
[37:04] rewarded very much
[37:07] do you hear what i'm saying
[37:09] amen that's not what we want you see uh
[37:13] i'm not just satisfied with someone
[37:15] reforming somebody
[37:17] and then being good to their wife or
[37:20] learning to be to live right or to treat
[37:22] their family right or be a good daddy to
[37:25] their children
[37:27] now all of those things are part of the
[37:29] land
[37:30] i mean they're part of the milk and
[37:31] honey that they're that we eat of
[37:34] but there's something that is beyond
[37:36] that
[37:37] it is the goal of the ages that our
[37:40] sight is set upon
[37:42] amen we are here in this land
[37:45] we are here to bring forth the messiah
[37:49] the king
[37:50] to bring jesus back to earth again
[37:53] is somebody with me amen that's really
[37:56] why the word has come not to give you a
[37:59] good family and a good home and a good
[38:02] church or a little healing campaign or a
[38:04] temporary healing god wants to do more
[38:07] than that he wants a people whose heart
[38:10] instead of one thing let us bring back
[38:13] the king
[38:19] in the greek
[38:21] this word sincerity means purity
[38:24] and it means to serve with a pure heart
[38:28] and so
[38:29] but as as he was saying
[38:32] let's serve the lord with sincerity and
[38:34] truth
[38:36] that means completely
[38:38] holy
[38:39] entirely
[38:40] in accord with truth
[38:43] now you're in this land and you're you
[38:46] who are
[38:47] now inheriting this
[38:49] remember what he wanted them to inherit
[38:51] was the resurrection
[38:54] and the messiah that's what they were
[38:56] coming back to the land for amen they
[39:00] were coming to meet the messiah so the
[39:03] redeemer could come
[39:05] amen and they were there to come to that
[39:08] land to build to prepare a place to get
[39:11] a place ready for the messiah to come
[39:15] amen that's what we've been called back
[39:17] for
[39:18] amen is to to the promised land of the
[39:22] word is so that we can bring
[39:25] we can bring forth the king amen the
[39:28] reason is not to start a new church that
[39:31] we can call them message churches
[39:34] amen that's not what this and if this is
[39:36] what it's about i quit
[39:39] amen i i don't want any more of it
[39:42] if that's what it's about just to have
[39:44] another group of people that are a
[39:46] little different from the baptists and
[39:48] the methodists and the presbyterian and
[39:50] they got a little different philosophy
[39:53] and you know they meet in a little
[39:54] different building and they dress in a
[39:56] little different way
[39:58] amen if that's all it's about i quit
[40:02] but i want to tell you it's more than
[40:04] that
[40:05] amen it's more than that
[40:08] it is that
[40:09] redemptive promise will be fulfilled in
[40:12] a people in this last day
[40:15] amen partial redemption given away to
[40:18] full redemption
[40:21] joshua 23 verse 14 he would tell them i
[40:24] am going away this day
[40:27] of uh go in the way of all the earth
[40:29] and you know in your hearts
[40:31] and in your souls
[40:33] that not one thing has failed
[40:36] of all the good things which the lord
[40:39] your god spake concerning you
[40:42] all are come to pass on you and not one
[40:45] thing
[40:46] has failed thereof
[40:48] listen god's true to his word
[40:51] amen he promised us good homes we got
[40:54] him
[40:55] he promised us good marriages that will
[40:57] last till death do us part amen we got
[41:00] them
[41:01] they made promises good children we have
[41:03] them
[41:04] he promised us wonderful churches we
[41:07] have them
[41:08] he promised us divine healing we have it
[41:12] amen not one good promise has ever
[41:15] fallen to the ground
[41:17] he keeps all of his word
[41:21] but i want you to notice in order to
[41:23] possess it
[41:25] then it's going to have to go back to
[41:27] the commission of joshua 1 and 3 every
[41:30] place that the soul of your foot has
[41:33] tread shall tread upon that i give to
[41:35] you
[41:36] you're going to have to possess it
[41:40] amen the forerunner the forerunner's job
[41:43] was to turn the hearts
[41:45] of the children back to the faith of the
[41:47] fathers
[41:48] and i just want to say god has kept his
[41:51] part of the bargain
[41:53] malachi 4 has been fulfilled luke 17 30
[41:57] revealing of the son of man all that
[41:59] many many scriptures have been have been
[42:02] fulfilled and god has kept his part of
[42:05] the bargain by bringing us into this
[42:08] word
[42:12] but i wonder sometimes have we kept ours
[42:17] have we kept our part
[42:19] because you see
[42:20] it required
[42:22] it required some people moving in faith
[42:25] and putting their foot on a divine
[42:27] promise
[42:30] now
[42:32] in the book of judges
[42:34] it kind of breaks my heart as it starts
[42:37] out
[42:38] after everything that god promised to do
[42:42] and yet in judges 9
[42:45] is 119 it says judges 1 19 and try to
[42:49] follow these scriptures if you can
[42:52] and the lord was with judah
[42:54] now that ought to be enough to shout
[42:56] about and he drave out the inhabitants
[42:59] of the mountains
[43:01] but could not drive out the inhabitants
[43:04] of the valley
[43:05] now first of all the lord was with them
[43:09] amen
[43:10] well look like if the lord was with them
[43:12] they could have driven out those in the
[43:14] valley but they couldn't do it because
[43:17] you see
[43:18] they were cherries of iron
[43:22] because because they had a greater army
[43:26] more equipment
[43:28] because the obstacle was greater
[43:31] and so therefore they did not drive out
[43:35] them in the valley
[43:37] then we find out in judges 1 21 and the
[43:41] children of benjamin did not drive out
[43:43] the jebesites that inhabited jerusalem
[43:45] but the jebusites dwelt with the
[43:47] children of benjamin in jerusalem unto
[43:49] this day the holy city
[43:53] the city of the king
[43:56] and yet they failed to possess it
[44:00] and then in verse 27 neither and this is
[44:03] how it goes into it neither dead and
[44:05] neither dead and neither did
[44:08] as it talks about the failures of those
[44:11] who were given the land
[44:14] i'll tell you church it's time that
[44:16] somebody breaks the cycle
[44:19] come on
[44:20] there are parts of the word we want to
[44:22] fulfill there are parts of the word we
[44:24] don't want to fulfill
[44:26] and i'll tell you what when it comes
[44:27] down to the book of judges where it says
[44:29] neither
[44:32] we don't want to fulfill that part
[44:34] we want to possess every bit of what's
[44:37] been given to us
[44:39] come on church
[44:40] amen verse 31 said neither did i answer
[44:43] and then it says you know but in verse
[44:45] 32 but the asteroids dwelt among the
[44:48] canaanites and the inhabitants of the
[44:51] land for they did not drive them out
[44:54] then verse 34 in the amorites
[44:57] and they forced the children of dan into
[45:00] the mountain for they would not suffer
[45:02] or allow them to come down in the valley
[45:06] now here we go again
[45:08] the enemy
[45:09] the devils demons standing on the
[45:12] promise of god
[45:14] on land that is our inheritance given us
[45:17] to god that god swore i bring you to
[45:22] and yet not enough faith
[45:24] to go down into that valley
[45:27] and possess
[45:28] that that and so they have to remain in
[45:31] the mountain couldn't go down in the
[45:33] valley and they're hiding among the
[45:35] rocks there
[45:39] now
[45:40] you see the first generation served the
[45:42] lord
[45:44] but the grandchildren did not
[45:47] and remember this god doesn't have any
[45:49] grandchildren
[45:51] he only has sons and daughters of god
[45:54] but you know we wind up having you know
[45:57] in our churches we wind up with church
[45:59] full of grandchildren they're just come
[46:02] along because well i was born in the
[46:04] message and i'm born in this church and
[46:06] i'm born in this movement and i'll tell
[46:09] you you know i will tell you if you've
[46:11] been born here you are blessed people
[46:15] you're a blessed person
[46:16] i dedicated the little winter's child i
[46:20] dedicated that daddy i dedicated that
[46:22] mama
[46:24] amen they were they were raised up here
[46:26] on the pews of this church but i'm just
[46:28] going to tell you again
[46:30] maybe they cut their teeth here and they
[46:32] were raised up here in this church but
[46:34] i'm telling you god doesn't have any
[46:36] grandchildren every person has to be
[46:39] born again of the same spirit of the
[46:42] almighty god
[46:44] every generation has to have their own
[46:46] revival
[46:50] now as we looked at that
[46:52] in chapter 2 and verse 11
[46:55] and the children of israel did evil in
[46:57] the sight of the lord and served balaam
[47:01] hardly a generation has passed
[47:03] since the forerunner
[47:06] and they pursued the lord god of their
[47:09] fathers which brought them out of the
[47:11] land of egypt
[47:13] and followed other gods the gods of the
[47:15] people that were round about them and
[47:17] bowed themselves to them and provoked
[47:19] the lord to anger and they pursued the
[47:21] lord and served baal and asteroth
[47:24] and the anger of the lord was hot
[47:26] against israel and he delivered them
[47:29] into the hands of the spoiler that
[47:31] spoiled them and he sold them into the
[47:33] hands of their enemies round about and
[47:35] that so that they could not stand any
[47:38] they could not any longer stand before
[47:41] their enemies
[47:44] this is a sad plight
[47:47] for a people that god had given the
[47:49] promise to
[47:51] a people who would have the faith of
[47:53] abraham
[47:54] are people who were to bring forth the
[47:56] king
[47:57] who had been brought back to this land
[47:59] for the the express purpose of the
[48:02] redeemer to come
[48:04] and what happens to them they get to
[48:06] where they can no longer stand
[48:09] against their enemies
[48:10] there's no longer any faith to stand
[48:13] against cancer
[48:15] no longer faith to stand against
[48:17] diseases
[48:19] no longer faith to stand against sin
[48:26] whether or so ever they went out their
[48:27] hand the lord was against them for evil
[48:30] as the lord said and as the lord has
[48:32] sworn unto them and they were greatly
[48:34] distressed
[48:35] nevertheless the lord raised up judges
[48:38] which delivered them out of the hands of
[48:40] those that spoiled them
[48:41] and yet they were not hearkening to
[48:43] their judges and they went whoring after
[48:45] other gods and bowed down themselves to
[48:47] them and they turned quickly out of the
[48:50] way which their fathers walked in
[48:51] obeying the commandments of the lord but
[48:54] they did
[48:55] and they did not sow
[48:58] so over and over the cycle
[49:02] of revival failure and death begins a
[49:06] vicious cycle
[49:08] a revival of failure and a revival and
[49:13] then failure and then from failure to
[49:15] death and another judge will rise up
[49:19] and again lead them in a revival and a
[49:22] move of god only for them to fail
[49:27] is somebody with me
[49:29] amen and then go down to the death again
[49:33] you see this is the very type of our
[49:35] church ages
[49:37] are you with me
[49:38] amen here god gave the holy ghost opened
[49:42] up the land on the day of pentecost
[49:44] but what happens
[49:46] is somebody with me now what happens to
[49:49] them they start in this cycle of revival
[49:53] failure death revival failure and death
[49:57] and god will raise up another messenger
[49:59] and bring another revival and then there
[50:01] will be failure the next generation and
[50:04] then death and then he'll start again
[50:06] and send another judge and he'll send
[50:09] and another move of the spirit and
[50:11] another revival
[50:14] and then failure
[50:16] and then death
[50:22] looks like pretty bleak
[50:27] but as i was reading the book i started
[50:30] to read the book of joe the judges
[50:32] actor joshua
[50:34] the lord that directed me right over
[50:36] into the book of ruth
[50:39] because right there in the book of ruth
[50:43] while the church ages are going on
[50:46] while the judges are doing their work
[50:49] i mean there there is somewhere in the
[50:52] midst of the judges here comes a ruth
[50:56] amen here comes a book outside of the
[50:59] judges the story of another people
[51:03] hallelujah another woman
[51:06] and this woman is ruth and she's a
[51:08] gentile
[51:10] come on she's a gentile woman but she
[51:13] was a woman there who said i'll leave
[51:16] things behind i'll leave my people
[51:18] behind i'll leave my life behind and my
[51:22] god's behind but i want to go to that
[51:25] promised land because there was
[51:27] something down on the inside of her that
[51:30] said i want that seed for a woman in my
[51:34] womb i want to bring forth the king
[51:37] now maybe she couldn't verbalize it
[51:40] but there was a drive
[51:43] down on the inside of that little
[51:45] gentile woman
[51:47] hallelujah
[51:48] amen while the others are going through
[51:51] this vicious cycle
[51:53] here comes another woman out
[51:57] amen
[52:00] leaving her people
[52:01] leaving her god's behind to become one
[52:05] of the people of the book
[52:07] to be a womb to receive the king's seed
[52:10] from the tribe of judah
[52:13] amen like rahab her womb never carried
[52:17] the seed of other men
[52:19] are you with me but her womb was
[52:21] reserved so she could be one of the
[52:24] mothers of the king messiah
[52:27] hallelujah she went back and then she
[52:29] would begin there ruth deciding
[52:32] justification
[52:34] a man's way back there in luther's day
[52:37] to to wesley's day of ruth serving works
[52:41] sanctification
[52:43] somebody with me now to ruth resting the
[52:46] baptism of the holy ghost a deposit
[52:50] hallelujah when the promise was given to
[52:52] her of the deposit remember he said open
[52:56] up open up your your your um
[52:59] open up your veil i want to just pour
[53:01] some measures down in there
[53:04] and then she filled or full and said you
[53:06] i'm not sending you home empty i'm
[53:08] giving you the deposit and there's more
[53:11] to come
[53:12] oh if you've got the blessed holy spirit
[53:15] today amen i say that's wonderful and
[53:18] that's good but it's a deposit and it
[53:20] only says there's more to come
[53:23] hallelujah there's more to come of it
[53:27] she would dare
[53:29] finally come to the point where she was
[53:31] rewarded
[53:32] and her reward was a whole lot more than
[53:35] handfuls on purpose
[53:38] amen her reward was boaz
[53:42] amen she received the land and the seed
[53:44] life of the king
[53:49] for from her would come
[53:51] would come from boaz and ruth would come
[53:53] over and from all the jesse and jesse
[53:56] david
[53:57] who would be the the the very prototype
[54:02] of the king of kings the lord of lords
[54:07] so now
[54:08] ruth had come
[54:10] a gentile bride and as i said
[54:13] boy as it started his work
[54:15] of redemption already the kinsmen
[54:18] redeemer
[54:19] is heading toward opening up the
[54:22] inheritance amen boaz started his work
[54:25] with justification sanctification
[54:27] baptism of the holy ghost unto bringing
[54:30] forth a child to lay in the lap of naomi
[54:33] the jewish church
[54:36] so now but while
[54:38] there is a move of god
[54:41] and god's got a plan
[54:44] the ages the church ages are
[54:47] cycling on
[54:49] the judges are cycling on
[54:52] and there you know it winds up with the
[54:56] last judge was eli
[54:58] who allowed corruption in the priesthood
[55:02] and the ark of the covenant was lost
[55:05] amen the word was captured by the enemy
[55:09] and taken out of the land of promise
[55:12] amen now so again there was no open
[55:16] vision in the days of samuel therefore
[55:18] where there's no vision the bible say
[55:20] the people perish
[55:23] we must have vision that visions comes
[55:25] to profit and it's the word of the lord
[55:27] that has spoken to them
[55:29] but now eli wasn't a prophet
[55:32] eli was a priest and he was getting old
[55:36] and his eyes were going dim and he
[55:38] couldn't see around and he was a great
[55:40] heavy man
[55:41] and he began to let the work of the lord
[55:44] go undone
[55:46] that's the condition as we end the
[55:48] church ages
[55:50] the work of the lord being undone
[55:53] miracles and signs and wonders gone
[55:57] the a living god is not present it's a
[55:59] historical god and when the resurrection
[56:03] is not preached in power
[56:06] the work is being left undone
[56:09] and and i just want to say
[56:11] if we're not careful we will find
[56:14] ourselves in that same groove
[56:17] perpetuating the ages
[56:20] somebody with me now amen let's look at
[56:23] this for a minute because we cannot
[56:25] afford to perpetuate the ages there's
[56:28] got to be some cycle breakers
[56:31] hallelujah i'll tell you this age will
[56:34] go down into death like all the other
[56:36] ages
[56:37] this age will go into corruption like
[56:39] all the other ages
[56:41] are you with me but there is a people in
[56:44] this age
[56:46] that will be a cycle breaker
[56:48] amen because it says the those that are
[56:51] alive and remain that somebody's still
[56:54] going to be alive
[56:56] [Music]
[56:57] a people who know their god and who can
[56:59] do exploits
[57:02] oh
[57:03] oh you know
[57:05] i think of what we have been given
[57:08] and we settle down
[57:10] as if we're another church age
[57:13] and maybe
[57:14] maybe you know you say well the work of
[57:16] the lord's not being undone brother tim
[57:19] we're still printing books
[57:22] we're still printing books we're still
[57:24] distributing gospel material
[57:26] so are they
[57:30] and i just want to say this church
[57:31] evening like tabernacle
[57:33] threw a burden in this in the hearts of
[57:35] the brothers here
[57:37] moving out there went in japan where
[57:39] there was not a message church at all
[57:43] whether there was no no group of
[57:45] believers there
[57:47] where there was no not one sermon that
[57:50] was translated into the japanese
[57:52] language and i want to say that by god's
[57:56] grace today evening like tabernacle has
[57:59] translated
[58:01] somebody with me
[58:03] 134 sermons of brother branham's
[58:06] right now that's the count that we have
[58:09] put upon the message hub where it can be
[58:11] read around the world
[58:15] amen
[58:16] and plus
[58:17] you know i've written three books for
[58:19] outreach on water baptism and on the on
[58:23] the cummins of elijah and then on the
[58:26] serpent seed and they have been
[58:28] translated now into many languages
[58:32] we just recently helped in uganda print
[58:35] thousands of copies in differently in
[58:37] several different languages to be a part
[58:40] of that revival there to establish them
[58:42] on the word of god
[58:44] amen they're now in norwegian and
[58:47] they're down in three different
[58:48] languages listen this is not to puff me
[58:50] up it's not about me it wasn't even my
[58:52] message
[58:54] i wrote these things for outreach not
[58:56] even for believers to reach out to new
[58:58] people
[59:00] and but let me just say
[59:03] but if we're not careful
[59:05] we're only changing people's opinion
[59:08] from one philosophy to another
[59:12] giving them a better knowledge of the
[59:14] word and baptizing them with water and i
[59:17] want you to say i'm all for that
[59:20] i rejoice in every baptism and i rejoice
[59:23] for every book published
[59:26] amen and we have helped we have helped
[59:28] build a church building i just finished
[59:31] one inside um i think it was zambia the
[59:34] country of zambia i just finished one
[59:36] where they just had a little shock
[59:38] couldn't stay out from under it because
[59:40] it it was just a a leafy the things
[59:43] money from your pocket help do that
[59:46] and we just finished a building for
[59:48] those saints to be able to worship
[59:51] in a little building that they killed
[59:53] fired out of made handmade bricks and
[59:56] made their own and put sheet metal on
[59:58] top of it and they got a place to
[1:00:00] worship and i want to say i'm thankful
[1:00:02] for every one of those church buildings
[1:00:06] and especially when i look out here and
[1:00:08] see what god's given us
[1:00:10] and see over that there somehow we
[1:00:12] lifted the burden of some little group
[1:00:17] but don't stop there
[1:00:20] where's the feeling of the holy ghost
[1:00:24] you know it's a false assumption to
[1:00:25] think that because they received church
[1:00:28] occur the current correct theology that
[1:00:31] they have the holy ghost that's not the
[1:00:32] holy ghost
[1:00:34] that's a baptist
[1:00:36] philosophy
[1:00:37] just receive this doctrine just say
[1:00:39] christ
[1:00:40] is my savior and this is what the
[1:00:43] message in large has done around the
[1:00:45] world
[1:00:48] they have brought a badness theology of
[1:00:51] just accepting god's sent a prophet and
[1:00:53] we have a message you receive that you
[1:00:56] got the holy ghost that ain't the holy
[1:00:58] ghost
[1:00:59] the holy ghost is an experience it's
[1:01:02] where god comes down in a life and
[1:01:04] changes him forever
[1:01:07] no it's not tongues and it's not a jump
[1:01:09] and it's not a shout we know all of that
[1:01:12] but i'll tell you when it comes there is
[1:01:15] something that moves on the inside
[1:01:18] and it's more than a reformation it's a
[1:01:21] power of transformation
[1:01:28] and the quote brother branham and when
[1:01:29] we try to educate the church to
[1:01:31] fellowship
[1:01:32] when we try to educate the people to
[1:01:34] christ
[1:01:36] we're just batting the air
[1:01:38] we're getting nowhere
[1:01:40] there's only one way that man or woman
[1:01:42] can come to christ and that's through
[1:01:44] the blood of jesus christ and being born
[1:01:46] again
[1:01:48] and you're not born again until you
[1:01:49] receive the holy ghost
[1:01:52] as he would say in
[1:01:54] in this message in 1965 i'm afraid that
[1:01:58] too many of us are not getting people to
[1:02:00] christ
[1:02:01] we're getting them to a church
[1:02:03] to a theory
[1:02:04] but we must get him to christ
[1:02:07] he is the only one and the only one that
[1:02:09] has life he that has the son
[1:02:11] has life
[1:02:15] and finally the judge is in like our
[1:02:17] church ages
[1:02:18] we're the priesthood
[1:02:20] and his corrupt sons
[1:02:23] and god raising up a prophet
[1:02:26] amen in that day it was by the name of
[1:02:28] samuel
[1:02:30] but can you imagine can you imagine here
[1:02:33] you know the corruptness that is
[1:02:35] happening with with religion
[1:02:38] as some man told brother our our lady
[1:02:41] actually told brother wayne on the plane
[1:02:43] brother wayne lawson was talking to her
[1:02:45] and she said i don't have an interest in
[1:02:48] church
[1:02:49] well all it's about in our lutheran
[1:02:50] church is a bunch of old people arguing
[1:02:53] over the money
[1:02:56] and that's about the way it ends
[1:02:59] you know running by committees and we'll
[1:03:01] get this preacher in and you know it's
[1:03:04] kind of like it just minutes when they
[1:03:06] were when they were
[1:03:08] were
[1:03:09] had to have a bigger larger building and
[1:03:11] they they got out of there into a little
[1:03:13] gymnasium of another church and and then
[1:03:16] they were beginning to preach and
[1:03:18] because there were more room people came
[1:03:20] and because and then the the movement of
[1:03:23] the holy spirit was taking place and
[1:03:25] there was rejoicing and shouting and
[1:03:28] they they tried to buy the building from
[1:03:30] the from the to the denominational
[1:03:32] church so let's let's just buy it you're
[1:03:34] you're just a handful of people said oh
[1:03:36] no we know what you've done
[1:03:38] we can see what you've done
[1:03:40] we
[1:03:41] we know you you y'all just got you a
[1:03:44] young preacher and with some new songs
[1:03:46] and things and and brought an enthusiasm
[1:03:49] in we're going to do the same thing
[1:03:51] we're going to fill this building up
[1:03:54] you see that's what they think
[1:03:57] they think it's a it's just about
[1:04:00] singing and worshiping and jumping or or
[1:04:03] some enthusiastic young preacher but
[1:04:07] it's more than that
[1:04:09] amen where the carcass is the eagles
[1:04:11] will gather
[1:04:13] amen but what is it that judges in as
[1:04:16] our church agents did with a corrupt
[1:04:18] priesthood
[1:04:19] corrupt sons
[1:04:22] can you imagine
[1:04:23] some like the methodist with homosexuals
[1:04:26] in their pulpit
[1:04:28] those who le and those ministers that
[1:04:31] lay with women
[1:04:32] adulterers preachers
[1:04:35] who divorced and married two or three
[1:04:37] times
[1:04:37] you got double married preachers in the
[1:04:39] pulpit
[1:04:41] can you imagine you know there they they
[1:04:43] they they
[1:04:45] get so in need of preachers that put
[1:04:47] women up to preach
[1:04:48] can you imagine they get in such a
[1:04:50] condition there in the in their whole
[1:04:53] ministry
[1:04:54] until there's drunks in the pulpit and
[1:04:57] they're getting arrested for drunk
[1:04:59] driving
[1:05:01] are you with me amen you know again what
[1:05:04] is it it's the corrupt ending of the
[1:05:08] church ages
[1:05:11] but in the middle of that god was
[1:05:13] sending a prophet
[1:05:16] hallelujah that was samuel he would have
[1:05:18] been a he was a just man a good man
[1:05:21] honorable reputable true honest with the
[1:05:23] people never deceiving them telling them
[1:05:26] that nothing but straight
[1:05:28] thus saith the lord
[1:05:30] and out of the thousands of visions it
[1:05:33] never failed
[1:05:35] can't you follow my parallel
[1:05:37] can't you see what we're talking about
[1:05:39] where we're at
[1:05:40] god's sending a prophet in this day with
[1:05:42] thousands upon thousands of visas
[1:05:46] never failed
[1:05:49] he wasn't a compromiser
[1:05:51] he wouldn't compromise on a holiness
[1:05:54] he wouldn't compromise for sin
[1:05:56] he would not compromise for money or
[1:05:59] popularity
[1:06:01] he could not be bought
[1:06:04] he could not be bribed
[1:06:06] he could not be coaxed so you know i'll
[1:06:08] give you we'll give you an airplane and
[1:06:10] we'll we'll get you out here among the
[1:06:12] who who's and we will give you a great
[1:06:15] ministry and we'll promote you
[1:06:17] but you just got to leave your your
[1:06:19] teaching behind
[1:06:23] you see eli was blind
[1:06:26] and israel was led by blind judge
[1:06:30] and a corrupt priesthood
[1:06:33] what a sad way to end the ages
[1:06:36] sons of eli laying with the women who
[1:06:38] came to worship stealing them stealing
[1:06:41] and taking by force the meat of the
[1:06:42] sacrifice
[1:06:44] and these abuses were just overlooked
[1:06:47] just swept under the rug by the
[1:06:49] priesthood
[1:06:52] but the bible said that the boy samuel
[1:06:55] ministered to the lord before eli
[1:06:58] and the word the lord was rare in those
[1:07:00] days
[1:07:03] and there was no widespread revelation i
[1:07:06] say god don't ever let us get that
[1:07:09] where the word the lord is rare
[1:07:12] god's speaking to his people like we
[1:07:14] were hearing this morning well when
[1:07:16] brother du plessis testimony
[1:07:18] it's got to be where the saints of god
[1:07:20] are in tune with god and can hear his
[1:07:23] voice
[1:07:24] men and women led by the spirit of
[1:07:26] god and it came to pass while eli was
[1:07:29] laying down in his place and his eye had
[1:07:32] begun to grow dim and he could not see
[1:07:35] then before the uh the lamp of god went
[1:07:38] out in the tabernacle of the lord where
[1:07:40] the ark of god was
[1:07:42] and that's about the way it is in the
[1:07:44] churches today
[1:07:46] sin is not rebuked
[1:07:48] it's not dealt with
[1:07:50] churches become rich
[1:07:53] sins become
[1:07:54] rampant a form of godliness but denying
[1:07:58] the power thereof
[1:07:59] and there is no vision and the word of
[1:08:01] god is rare
[1:08:04] the judge is in with eli blind and dying
[1:08:07] and the ark the word of the lord shaken
[1:08:11] and children birthed out of that
[1:08:15] called ichabod
[1:08:21] meaning the glory of the lord has
[1:08:22] departed
[1:08:25] brother branham said and let people
[1:08:26] shake themselves tonight and flee from
[1:08:28] the route that is to come for ichabod is
[1:08:31] written over the doors and over the
[1:08:33] nations
[1:08:34] a black checkmark has come across it the
[1:08:37] spirit of god has grieved away from it
[1:08:38] and there weighed in the balances and
[1:08:40] found warning
[1:08:43] you see even among the churches
[1:08:46] that claimed to be free
[1:08:48] claimed to be in the truth
[1:08:50] claimed to break in this broken the
[1:08:52] cycle they don't have any desire to see
[1:08:54] a soul saved
[1:08:56] it's all about what's in our four walls
[1:08:59] it's all about us for and
[1:09:02] and no more
[1:09:04] you know and and brother branham would
[1:09:06] you know would talk about a man because
[1:09:09] you see they have no burden to see souls
[1:09:12] saved and you even hear preachers say i
[1:09:14] don't want to see any souls snapping
[1:09:16] around at my altar
[1:09:22] brother branham said i've been to places
[1:09:24] and people supposed to be spirit-filled
[1:09:25] people see all their calls made and why
[1:09:28] you couldn't get anybody to pray with
[1:09:30] them
[1:09:31] it shows that it's ichabod
[1:09:33] the spear the lord has departed but when
[1:09:36] you see that zeal and fire and longing
[1:09:38] and long for human souls
[1:09:42] and he said any religion that hasn't got
[1:09:44] the blood life of jesus christ behind it
[1:09:47] the death angel is on it
[1:09:49] right death angel separated from god yes
[1:09:51] indeed ichabod is wrote on every bit of
[1:09:54] it that hasn't got the blood
[1:09:56] you say well i'm glad the blood but he
[1:09:59] said it the blood hasn't taken effect
[1:10:02] if it hasn't taken effect and you see it
[1:10:04] in your life as a consecrated child of
[1:10:07] god with what jesus said would they take
[1:10:10] place then be careful you might have
[1:10:12] something else besides the blood you
[1:10:14] might have a little injection of
[1:10:16] theology in there or something or a
[1:10:18] little injector injection or some
[1:10:20] sensation or say i quivered i shook i
[1:10:23] danced i did this be careful
[1:10:27] see you can go to either extreme
[1:10:30] do it don't just talk about don't just
[1:10:32] pick on the emotional side
[1:10:34] amen but also realize there are some
[1:10:36] that's all they got is an injection of
[1:10:38] theology
[1:10:39] and that's just as wrong as going to the
[1:10:42] other side it's a balanced walk that we
[1:10:44] must have
[1:10:46] said if the if the medicine ever strikes
[1:10:48] you it's good for every human being
[1:10:51] it'll save from sin it'll clean up from
[1:10:53] the life of sin it'll make a different
[1:10:55] person out of you it'll take the doubt
[1:10:58] away it'll make you a new creation in
[1:10:59] christ jesus
[1:11:01] and that's the spirit of this nation big
[1:11:03] time somebody television program lots of
[1:11:06] jokes to be cracked
[1:11:08] why that makes a real christian sick at
[1:11:10] his stomach to hear of such things
[1:11:13] a man or woman can look at that kind of
[1:11:15] stuff that we have on tv today and some
[1:11:17] of them programs and enjoy it shows that
[1:11:20] ichabod is right over the top of your
[1:11:22] heart
[1:11:23] the glory of the lord has departed and
[1:11:26] when the church loses its attraction
[1:11:30] when it comes to time do you have to
[1:11:32] sign cards and things to come to church
[1:11:34] i think it's time for a prayer meeting
[1:11:36] or something to take place in the church
[1:11:39] amen and in the church christ ought to
[1:11:41] be the attraction
[1:11:43] amen
[1:11:45] you know a church
[1:11:46] should be like a tree that's planted by
[1:11:48] the rivers of water
[1:11:50] it don't wither
[1:11:53] i don't care if it comes dry season or
[1:11:55] wet season or this season or that
[1:11:57] problem or that problem or whatever its
[1:12:00] tree its roots are in the rivers of
[1:12:02] living water
[1:12:04] its leaf it doesn't wither
[1:12:07] amen you know that brother branham
[1:12:09] talked about this in planting divine he
[1:12:11] said it's like david said again in
[1:12:14] psalms and blessed is the man that will
[1:12:16] not join up with the scoffers
[1:12:20] and ungodly people
[1:12:22] remember that's one of the signs if you
[1:12:24] listen to the rapture one of the very
[1:12:26] signs of the rapture
[1:12:28] is more than the shout voice and the
[1:12:30] trump one of the signs that scoffers
[1:12:32] rise in the last days
[1:12:35] you see there's some fulfilling that
[1:12:37] other part
[1:12:39] and i just want to say be real careful
[1:12:41] about your scoffing
[1:12:43] when you want to scoff at the baptism of
[1:12:45] the holy ghost when you want to scoff at
[1:12:48] somebody weeping their way to calvary
[1:12:50] when you want to scoff at the tears
[1:12:52] rolling down their face and something
[1:12:54] more than a dried-eyed confession and
[1:12:56] you want to scoff at it it's because the
[1:12:58] ichabod is written over you
[1:13:02] your leaf has withered
[1:13:06] it's got verses say
[1:13:08] days of miracles have passed
[1:13:10] and the baptism of the holy ghost is
[1:13:12] just make belief
[1:13:13] i'm quoting brother branham
[1:13:15] blessed is a man that'll not do that
[1:13:19] blessed is a man that stand forth from
[1:13:21] such a thing
[1:13:22] they don't want to mix those together
[1:13:24] you can't mix those things together
[1:13:25] blessed is a man who want to assemble
[1:13:28] himself unto one of those that denies
[1:13:30] the power of the lord the bible said
[1:13:33] come out from among such for the day
[1:13:35] will come they'll be heady high-minded
[1:13:37] lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
[1:13:39] god having a form of godliness but
[1:13:41] denying the power thereof from such turn
[1:13:43] away
[1:13:44] blessed is a man that will not assemble
[1:13:46] himself with these scoffers
[1:13:49] making fun call in the true church a
[1:13:52] bunch of fanatics
[1:13:55] amen oh brother raven said blessed is
[1:13:58] the man
[1:13:59] who will not who will not assemble
[1:14:02] himself with those cattle scoffers
[1:14:04] he will be like a tree planted by the
[1:14:07] rivers of water
[1:14:08] god put him in a choice spot his fruit
[1:14:11] shall not wither he will bring forth his
[1:14:13] leaves and his fruits and his season
[1:14:15] watch how david worded that this man is
[1:14:18] blessed he will be planted not just set
[1:14:21] out you know i see anything planted
[1:14:23] israel and egypt was not planted they
[1:14:26] were set out but it wasn't their
[1:14:28] original home ground and that's a
[1:14:30] christian that rested eternal
[1:14:32] destination upon um
[1:14:35] some domino creed
[1:14:37] denominational creed he's not in his
[1:14:39] right place he was born to be free a
[1:14:42] child of god to worship god but he's
[1:14:44] under a creed and he can't bring forth
[1:14:47] his fruits
[1:14:48] yet something in him is longing to do it
[1:14:51] he shall be like a tree that's planted
[1:14:53] by the rivers rivers plural waters
[1:14:55] singular many rivers coming from one
[1:14:58] channel
[1:14:59] in other words he'll be like a man in
[1:15:01] the scripture that believes all the word
[1:15:03] of god
[1:15:04] where the power and the nine spiritual
[1:15:06] gifts that flow through one god and to
[1:15:08] his inner most being
[1:15:11] people don't believe in shouting
[1:15:13] the thing of it is they haven't got
[1:15:15] spiritual joy and the joys of the water
[1:15:18] of life can flow through
[1:15:20] that's what's in my home what's matter
[1:15:22] with branham tabernacle because that
[1:15:25] unbelief the cares of the world has
[1:15:27] bound the people until it cannot produce
[1:15:30] spiritual growth
[1:15:31] and that's what's the matter with our
[1:15:33] nation that's what's the matter with our
[1:15:34] churches they have no joy and the joy of
[1:15:37] the lord is departed as it's written one
[1:15:39] time in the scripture the hebrew word of
[1:15:41] ichabod which means the presence of the
[1:15:44] lord has departed
[1:15:47] that's over our churches
[1:15:49] because we left off for the original
[1:15:51] foundation
[1:15:53] and he even said branham tabernacle a
[1:15:57] message church
[1:16:04] now the people
[1:16:07] want a king
[1:16:12] god has sent him a prophet
[1:16:14] but they want a king
[1:16:18] notice the desire the people god is
[1:16:20] about to give him a king
[1:16:25] he's already been working
[1:16:27] there's ruth
[1:16:29] of moabitus
[1:16:31] deciding
[1:16:32] working serving
[1:16:35] somebody help me
[1:16:36] meeting the kinsmen redeemer
[1:16:39] amen and she see there gets bow eyes and
[1:16:42] she receives the seed life
[1:16:45] and it's on its way
[1:16:47] it's about here
[1:16:51] and just before the king comes
[1:16:54] the people want one of their own
[1:16:56] choosings
[1:17:01] now you're seeing where i'm going
[1:17:04] now here this picture comes in
[1:17:07] god's about to give him king one after
[1:17:08] his own heart one that he can be king
[1:17:10] through
[1:17:12] and i'll tell you what
[1:17:14] god is about to give us the king
[1:17:18] the messiah the lion of the tribe of
[1:17:20] judah his advance in heaven is moving
[1:17:23] the king is coming the title is being
[1:17:26] handed to a bride as he calls for his
[1:17:29] queen to come stand by his side
[1:17:32] but before the king can come
[1:17:35] before the rapture can consummate
[1:17:39] the people select assault
[1:17:43] of the wrong tribe
[1:17:47] are you with me
[1:17:49] at the wrong lineage
[1:17:51] oh he's an israelite but he's of the
[1:17:53] tribe of benjamin
[1:17:55] and the word of the lord has been that
[1:17:58] out of judah will the scepter come
[1:18:02] and he will rule my people i'm going to
[1:18:04] be giving you a king but he'll come out
[1:18:05] of judah but before he can come out of
[1:18:08] judah they select a man of their own
[1:18:10] choosing
[1:18:14] a son of kiss
[1:18:17] and i want you to listen to me
[1:18:19] the son of kiss
[1:18:20] he only perpetuated the judges
[1:18:26] it was only a continual cycle of revival
[1:18:30] hope disappointment and failure and
[1:18:33] death
[1:18:38] now when i'm preaching this
[1:18:41] i'm not i am not pointing to one certain
[1:18:44] son of kiss
[1:18:46] because there are thousands of them
[1:18:50] there are men with the spirit of
[1:18:52] organization the denominational mindset
[1:18:55] that rules laodicea
[1:18:59] is the organizational life that people
[1:19:01] want
[1:19:02] you know i just go to church
[1:19:05] when i feel like it maybe sometimes if
[1:19:07] i'm a good christian two or three times
[1:19:09] a week
[1:19:10] and do my religion
[1:19:12] but don't have a personal everyday walk
[1:19:15] with christ
[1:19:19] i heard of a man here the other day was
[1:19:22] told of a young man that was boasting
[1:19:25] i'm blessed
[1:19:26] everything i tell touch turns to gold
[1:19:29] but i don't read my bible every day
[1:19:31] and i don't pray every day and yet god
[1:19:34] still blesses me
[1:19:38] what is it it's an organizational life
[1:19:41] and it's an organizational life that
[1:19:43] people want
[1:19:45] amen you know
[1:19:47] again you know
[1:19:49] you see
[1:19:50] a life
[1:19:51] a life of a believer must follow jesus
[1:19:54] every day
[1:19:58] you've got to be just as real of a
[1:20:00] christian on monday as you were on
[1:20:02] sunday
[1:20:04] and on tuesday as you were on monday and
[1:20:06] on wednesday as you were on tuesday and
[1:20:09] all the way through it's an everyday
[1:20:12] walk
[1:20:14] brother branham is your life where the
[1:20:16] gospel he said israel walked day and
[1:20:18] night by the pillar of fire when the
[1:20:20] pillar of fire moved they moved with it
[1:20:23] and remember it was a fire at night in
[1:20:24] the cloud by days it might come day or
[1:20:27] night any time but whenever it was there
[1:20:29] was a perpetuation made that they would
[1:20:32] not fail to see it it was the light at
[1:20:34] night the cloud in the daytime and they
[1:20:36] followed it yes sir same thing
[1:20:38] martin luther saw it what did he do he
[1:20:41] came out of catholicism but what did
[1:20:43] they do they built a little fence around
[1:20:45] and said we're lutherans
[1:20:47] this is it
[1:20:48] wesley come along moving from there and
[1:20:50] he went what'd they do built a little
[1:20:52] fence around and said this is it what
[1:20:55] the light do moved right on
[1:20:57] pentecost saw it and what they do moved
[1:21:00] out of the west with the nazarenes and
[1:21:01] so forth what'd they do they built a
[1:21:03] little fence around and said we're
[1:21:04] oneness
[1:21:06] we're trinity
[1:21:07] and we're united
[1:21:09] and what'd he do god moved right out of
[1:21:11] it
[1:21:12] we cannot do that
[1:21:17] we got to follow every day every hour
[1:21:19] the day every step of the way we got to
[1:21:21] be led by the lord jesus christ
[1:21:24] if we don't we take an
[1:21:26] organizational life
[1:21:29] and a life that doesn't follow christ
[1:21:31] daily is not worthy
[1:21:39] the real king was to be the holy spirit
[1:21:44] leading and before but before the people
[1:21:46] could bring on a man who would allow
[1:21:49] god's leadership
[1:21:50] and be king through him they rejected
[1:21:53] the king
[1:21:56] that's where we are the king is being
[1:21:58] rejected
[1:21:59] i'm talking about the holy spirit
[1:22:02] i am not talking about some man i'm
[1:22:04] talking about holy spirit leadership
[1:22:06] in individual life and the king has been
[1:22:08] rejected and the intellectual men are
[1:22:11] chosen instead
[1:22:14] sons of kiss rising up
[1:22:16] now sons who kiss
[1:22:19] are good israelites
[1:22:21] they're handsome
[1:22:22] and their head and shoulders above all
[1:22:24] the others
[1:22:26] but you is never to be led by intellects
[1:22:34] recently
[1:22:35] just recently i heard a son of kish
[1:22:38] defending the use of psychology
[1:22:41] and stated that the holy spirit is the
[1:22:43] greatest psychologist
[1:22:44] psychologist that ever was
[1:22:48] saying i think psychology has its place
[1:22:50] when it's used by the holy spirit
[1:22:54] and i want you to say the holy spirit
[1:22:56] has never used psychology
[1:22:59] you know to think of it given a
[1:23:01] description of the holy spirit as the
[1:23:03] greatest psychologist think of that
[1:23:06] if that isn't a son of kiss
[1:23:09] polished educated smart intellectual
[1:23:13] and that's the kind of ministry that
[1:23:15] wants to rise up
[1:23:17] you're showing you that showing they
[1:23:20] don't know the power of god
[1:23:23] you see psychology has no place in the
[1:23:26] ministry
[1:23:27] it has no place in our literature
[1:23:31] we never needed dr dobson before and we
[1:23:35] don't need him now
[1:23:37] we don't need their books of psychology
[1:23:39] then and we don't need them now
[1:23:42] we got one book that we need and that's
[1:23:44] the bible
[1:23:46] the word of god are you with me
[1:23:49] psychology has no place in the ministry
[1:23:51] god doesn't need it and god doesn't use
[1:23:55] it
[1:23:56] and if you think that the holy ghost is
[1:23:58] the greatest psychology there ever was
[1:24:00] then you don't know the holy ghost
[1:24:02] you've never known this power you've
[1:24:04] never known it's life-changing abilities
[1:24:09] see psychology is the study of the mind
[1:24:11] how it works
[1:24:12] how it affects behavior
[1:24:15] psychology is man's attempt to fix a
[1:24:18] spiritual problem by education
[1:24:22] it's man fixing another man without the
[1:24:25] spirit of god
[1:24:26] trying to do what only god can do
[1:24:29] without god fixing the people
[1:24:32] you see psychology is just changing the
[1:24:35] mind trying to change the behavior
[1:24:39] amen that's not what we preach
[1:24:42] amen we preach preaching nature change
[1:24:46] what the old man of sin is dead
[1:24:49] and you're risen in christ we preach a
[1:24:51] resurrection
[1:24:55] a psychologist treats a patient through
[1:24:58] psychotherapy
[1:24:59] help or you know hoping to relieve the
[1:25:02] symptoms through behavioral change
[1:25:05] the role as a psychiatrist is is a
[1:25:07] medical doctor
[1:25:09] focusing more on practice and medication
[1:25:12] and other inventions to manage the
[1:25:14] mental health conditions
[1:25:16] but i i want you to know that you see
[1:25:19] the holy spirit is not a psychologist
[1:25:23] and he's not the greatest psychologist
[1:25:25] everyone he's the greatest discerner of
[1:25:27] the heart
[1:25:28] the deliverer of the bound the deliverer
[1:25:31] of the tormented
[1:25:32] amen the gospel does not relieve fear by
[1:25:36] behavioral change
[1:25:38] fear is an evil spirit
[1:25:40] it's a tormenting spirit and the holy
[1:25:43] spirit casts out devils
[1:25:47] amen that's mark 16. amen it did not say
[1:25:51] we'll use psychology on them said in my
[1:25:54] name we'll cast out devils
[1:25:56] [Applause]
[1:25:58] the holy spirit was not performing
[1:26:00] psychology on someone when discerning
[1:26:02] the cause of their sickness he was
[1:26:04] showing where the demon of fear had
[1:26:06] attached himself to that person and
[1:26:08] started causing their illness
[1:26:12] and that's why we don't need sons of
[1:26:15] kiss
[1:26:16] in the pulpit
[1:26:18] we need god called men who know the
[1:26:20] power of god
[1:26:22] amen that aren't trained to use
[1:26:24] psychology but are trained by the holy
[1:26:26] ghost to cast satan out
[1:26:31] brother branham said in israel in the
[1:26:33] church and by the way i've been
[1:26:35] listening to that series too
[1:26:38] he said i believe we're on the
[1:26:39] borderline tonight
[1:26:42] oh god where are we now this is 1953.
[1:26:45] maybe we're maybe we're in there
[1:26:48] i was wondering all about my meetings
[1:26:50] and things how i had to cancel them out
[1:26:53] i truly believe before the church can
[1:26:54] have the rapture it's got to have
[1:26:56] rapture and faith
[1:26:58] we can't have faith for divine healing
[1:27:00] let alone alone rapturing faith got to
[1:27:03] have faith that would change and quicken
[1:27:05] this body and be taken away i believe
[1:27:08] there's a church on this road tonight
[1:27:11] a power of the living god that men will
[1:27:13] speak the word here and there and it'll
[1:27:16] flash like lightning and a church is
[1:27:18] coming out not a psychologist not
[1:27:21] something that's put on make-believe but
[1:27:23] a real true genuine anointing holy ghost
[1:27:27] called out church
[1:27:30] hallelujah that's what's here tonight
[1:27:32] amen that's what we want an evening like
[1:27:34] tabernacle a holy ghost to knowing it
[1:27:37] called out church
[1:27:39] not putting out some behavioral change
[1:27:42] and changing your mind and causing you
[1:27:44] to take this philosophy and trade it for
[1:27:47] another it's more than that it's the
[1:27:49] power of transformation that makes and
[1:27:52] turns a center into a child of god
[1:27:58] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:28:00] the king
[1:28:02] is rejected
[1:28:04] laodicea is chosen
[1:28:07] rejected
[1:28:08] and the intellectual
[1:28:10] conception
[1:28:12] allowed to be king
[1:28:16] and you can never
[1:28:18] live an overcoming life
[1:28:21] with an intellectual son of kiss
[1:28:23] as king
[1:28:28] oh
[1:28:29] they want something they can call sane
[1:28:31] and sensible
[1:28:33] where you just embrace a doctrine
[1:28:35] but there's never been a visitation from
[1:28:37] the presence of the lord
[1:28:39] in invisible union he said neither can
[1:28:42] you bear god's son word
[1:28:45] god's word son
[1:28:47] neither can the church bring forth they
[1:28:49] don't want one of them screaming
[1:28:52] children shouting speaking in tongues
[1:28:54] and all them things yeah they you can't
[1:28:56] do that in a denominational church
[1:28:59] you can't do it in a
[1:29:01] kiss church either
[1:29:04] they won't have you they won't bring
[1:29:06] them like that they'll take them up and
[1:29:09] shake their hands and say i believe you
[1:29:10] got it
[1:29:11] as long as you put your name on the book
[1:29:13] that's all you have to do see it's
[1:29:15] illegitimate children do the word and
[1:29:17] still claim religion
[1:29:20] as he said satan don't care
[1:29:23] how religious you are
[1:29:26] or how right you are in your doctrine
[1:29:30] amen
[1:29:31] if you miss that life
[1:29:33] you won't come up anyhow
[1:29:35] no matter how religious how good how
[1:29:37] many churches you belong to or will
[1:29:39] belong to it doesn't matter one thing
[1:29:41] unless you've been born again
[1:29:48] it says the enemy tries to say that age
[1:29:50] of miracles are past there's no such
[1:29:53] thing as a baptism of the holy spirit
[1:29:56] that this is only emotion
[1:29:58] it's only a workup
[1:30:00] so the enemy is challenged and his
[1:30:02] challenge must be met
[1:30:05] this end-time evangelism and the day the
[1:30:08] scientific theory of the modern
[1:30:10] so-called religious group has tried to
[1:30:11] prove that this blessed thing that we
[1:30:15] have called the holy spirit is only
[1:30:17] emotion
[1:30:19] that's what the scoffers are saying now
[1:30:22] it's just emotion
[1:30:24] you know and they don't stand up
[1:30:25] according to their scientific theory
[1:30:27] well i'd like to ask them this
[1:30:30] what makes them
[1:30:32] change what makes the drunkard stop
[1:30:36] drinking
[1:30:39] amen what makes a prostitute cease or
[1:30:42] evil life
[1:30:43] amen what makes the cancer and diseases
[1:30:46] depart from the people and the death to
[1:30:48] dumb the blind of the dead to raise up
[1:30:51] explain that is that emotion
[1:30:54] it has emotion with it
[1:30:57] certainly
[1:31:00] certainly certainly
[1:31:05] anything
[1:31:06] that's alive
[1:31:08] has emotion
[1:31:10] and anything that doesn't have emotion
[1:31:12] is dead
[1:31:15] excuse expression but i think we ought
[1:31:17] to bury some of our emotions religion
[1:31:19] then
[1:31:20] because it's dead
[1:31:22] it has no emotion in it in religion that
[1:31:25] has not emotions should be buried aha
[1:31:27] because it is emotional
[1:31:32] hallelujah amen you can't tell me the
[1:31:35] presence of christ comes down
[1:31:37] and you're and you just stand there and
[1:31:39] oh well i didn't ever know it even
[1:31:41] happened
[1:31:44] you see
[1:31:45] they might come as studious intellectual
[1:31:48] educated man
[1:31:50] or in some cases
[1:31:52] now here's where it is
[1:31:54] in some cases even come disguised as a
[1:31:56] move of god
[1:31:58] with much fanfare and with shoutings and
[1:32:01] great expressions of emotion and great
[1:32:04] worship but watch it
[1:32:07] it's a move it's a anointing of a son of
[1:32:10] kish
[1:32:11] not with the anointing of god but the
[1:32:14] anointing of man
[1:32:16] to build up
[1:32:18] a kingdom
[1:32:22] now this message started with divine
[1:32:24] healing
[1:32:26] and the power of god it will end with a
[1:32:28] massive move
[1:32:31] of total divine healing
[1:32:34] it'll be so glorious that hair will come
[1:32:36] back the right color
[1:32:39] amen it'll be so glorious that wrinkles
[1:32:42] will fall off and the skin becomes
[1:32:44] glorified
[1:32:46] cripples will run and blind will see and
[1:32:48] death will hear and old age will fade
[1:32:50] away in a miraculous movement and a
[1:32:53] moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:32:57] this message started out with the
[1:32:58] visitation of an angel
[1:33:01] and healing faith
[1:33:03] and it will end
[1:33:05] with a climax
[1:33:07] of rapturing faith
[1:33:09] the king will come
[1:33:11] are you with me
[1:33:12] it started out casting out devils for
[1:33:15] salvation
[1:33:17] not a 12-step aaa meeting where you
[1:33:19] learn to cope with your problem
[1:33:22] amen
[1:33:23] will you learn to cope with your
[1:33:25] problems so you don't reach for the
[1:33:26] bottle when you're having a problem
[1:33:30] when you get up and you still declare
[1:33:32] i'm an alcoholic
[1:33:34] i'll always be an alcoholic
[1:33:36] but i've learned
[1:33:38] that that behavior is not healthy
[1:33:43] and that sounds like a lot of so-called
[1:33:46] christians
[1:33:47] i'm a sinner
[1:33:48] i'll always be a sinner
[1:33:51] but i've learned you know
[1:33:54] that some of that behavior just ain't
[1:33:56] healthy
[1:33:57] so i try to be good
[1:34:01] it's not a learned behavior
[1:34:04] it's a deliverance
[1:34:06] a deliverance from the demons of hell
[1:34:08] that's pulling through your appetites
[1:34:11] salvation then becomes with people and
[1:34:14] the intellectual approach to changing
[1:34:16] behavior that's what sons of kiss will
[1:34:18] do
[1:34:19] shining army
[1:34:20] higher head and shoulder above the head
[1:34:23] of all that's around him his words are
[1:34:26] polished with education
[1:34:30] i was in a men's meeting
[1:34:32] and they called on a man to testify of
[1:34:35] how he overcame
[1:34:38] how he overcame pornography
[1:34:41] you know he had a bad pornography habit
[1:34:43] and he was a married man and he said
[1:34:46] what i've done
[1:34:48] brothers i've learned to associate
[1:34:51] pornography with pain
[1:34:53] the pain that was causing my wife and
[1:34:56] family and the harm it was doing and so
[1:34:58] now that's how i've overcome pornography
[1:35:03] that is not overcoming
[1:35:06] now i'm not even talking about
[1:35:08] i'm not even talking about brother's
[1:35:10] keeper program what was that called
[1:35:12] promise keeper program i'm talking about
[1:35:15] message people
[1:35:17] talking about their deliverance
[1:35:20] in such a way that's not deliverance
[1:35:23] overcoming pornography is recognizing
[1:35:27] that it's sin
[1:35:28] and i need a savior i need a holy ghost
[1:35:31] baptism that i take away and deal with a
[1:35:35] sin nature that's on the inside of me
[1:35:37] that has an appetite that's pulling
[1:35:39] through my body
[1:35:42] pornography
[1:35:46] the holy ghost takes away the desire of
[1:35:48] sin
[1:35:50] we want something besides the holy ghost
[1:35:53] to be king over
[1:35:54] us we'll adopt psychology
[1:35:58] we'll adopt some other system of man
[1:36:01] rather
[1:36:02] than have an outpouring of the holy
[1:36:04] ghost
[1:36:05] because we don't know snotting over in
[1:36:07] our altars we don't want no tears we
[1:36:09] don't want no dying out
[1:36:11] we we want you to become insane and
[1:36:13] sensible saying unsensible
[1:36:18] we want a king
[1:36:20] what we want is somebody to tell us what
[1:36:22] to do
[1:36:24] you know today we already got like the
[1:36:26] baptists
[1:36:28] as a baptist preacher told me one time
[1:36:30] he said i don't know how you do it
[1:36:33] you get up and preach two hours at a
[1:36:34] time i could never do that i've been a
[1:36:36] preacher for years and i could never do
[1:36:38] that
[1:36:39] said well i'll tell you what all i do is
[1:36:41] i get this little letter here from the
[1:36:43] church and i get up and i i read my
[1:36:46] sermon to them
[1:36:48] and said it's over in 15 minutes i don't
[1:36:50] know where you where you got all of that
[1:36:52] stuff that you're preaching i don't know
[1:36:54] i don't know where all that comes from
[1:36:55] how do you preach like that
[1:36:59] you see we they what the baptist got to
[1:37:02] do they had so many sons of kiss
[1:37:04] that all they did was send them a
[1:37:06] program
[1:37:08] here is what you're to preach on this
[1:37:10] week

[1:39:27] serious
[1:39:28] amen i'm very i'm serious as i can be
[1:39:31] about this

[1:40:10] what to do
[1:40:12] just believe this creed learn this greek
[1:40:15] word you're going in the rapture you're
[1:40:16] all right
[1:40:18] you're going to hell is what you're
[1:40:19] doing
[1:40:20] or into the tribulation
[1:40:24] but there's you know never been an age
[1:40:27] in any time that god's intention was for
[1:40:30] us to act like the world
[1:40:32] you know god's people are to be a
[1:40:34] peculiar people a different people are
[1:40:36] called out people are separated all
[1:40:38] together in their actions their ways
[1:40:40] their manner of living than what the
[1:40:42] world has
[1:40:44] and brother branham warned us over and
[1:40:46] over
[1:40:48] hear me across the nation and across the
[1:40:50] world and in this church
[1:40:52] only god's only provided place of
[1:40:54] worship he said now you notice every
[1:40:56] three years after a great meeting what
[1:40:58] takes place a denomination
[1:41:02] and this has been 20 years and no
[1:41:04] denomination
[1:41:06] dear dying lamb may it never do that
[1:41:10] if i go in this generation may the
[1:41:12] people who believe this message never
[1:41:13] stand still for a denomination
[1:41:17] you'll die right in your track
[1:41:19] remember the very hour you mentioned
[1:41:22] denomination among you i don't care how
[1:41:24] sincere you are take man for your leader
[1:41:27] instead of the holy spirit to confirm
[1:41:30] this word that's the hour you die
[1:41:33] the genuine seed cannot because there's
[1:41:35] nothing left after the seed you see it's
[1:41:37] the same thing that was back at the
[1:41:38] beginning it's the pride that fell at
[1:41:40] the ground to bring forth the corn of
[1:41:41] wheat again and there's nothing past the
[1:41:44] grain
[1:41:45] we're at the end of the cycles
[1:41:51] oh brother tim
[1:41:53] ah we're no denomination
[1:41:56] you can have an organizational life
[1:42:02] sitting right in the evening like
[1:42:04] tabernacle
[1:42:07] remember like divorce is not the paper
[1:42:10] god hates
[1:42:12] it's the behavior
[1:42:15] you can behave like a divorced couple no
[1:42:17] love no respect possessive controlling
[1:42:19] hateful mean and still be married
[1:42:25] and you don't have to have the paper
[1:42:27] organization to be denominated
[1:42:30] in fact to the battery is brother
[1:42:32] brandon said i indict these
[1:42:34] denominations and many of the
[1:42:35] independents
[1:42:40] when you behave like a denomination with
[1:42:42] pastors controlling like a king and king
[1:42:45] and kingdom building and no miracles
[1:42:48] no moving of the spirit
[1:42:51] binding them down to slavery
[1:42:56] even let me let me just say even making
[1:42:59] brother branham you're king he let me
[1:43:01] tell you he's not god
[1:43:04] he's not the holy ghost
[1:43:06] he's not to be your king
[1:43:08] god didn't send brother branham to be
[1:43:10] the head of a personality cult
[1:43:14] amen god don't want his son joseph
[1:43:16] branham to be a person not that he
[1:43:18] called the leader either but that's what
[1:43:20] they made him
[1:43:22] just as it did with lee vale and joseph
[1:43:24] coleman and a myriad of others and i
[1:43:26] could keep calling names because there's
[1:43:28] big sauls and little sauls
[1:43:31] with big kingdoms and little kingdoms
[1:43:35] nicolette and spirits the spirit of
[1:43:36] denomination
[1:43:38] as paul brother branham said paul knew
[1:43:41] that it would implement a way of worship
[1:43:43] that excluded the people
[1:43:44] from any part of a holy spirit ministry
[1:43:48] and even right today among those who
[1:43:49] claim to be free and full of the spirit
[1:43:52] there's not too much freedom in the
[1:43:53] laity and the best we can see is a few
[1:43:56] preachers with inspired preaching while
[1:43:58] the flop just sits there and tries to
[1:44:00] absorb it this is far cry from paul who
[1:44:03] said all came together and all had the
[1:44:05] leading of the spirit and all
[1:44:07] participated in spiritual worship
[1:44:10] but what happened the people got caught
[1:44:12] up
[1:44:13] we want a king
[1:44:15] we want a man that we could say about
[1:44:17] him this is our guide we follow this
[1:44:20] we're in this movement this is our we're
[1:44:22] in this group
[1:44:24] we we got the corner on the market here
[1:44:26] and you know we're the ones going in the
[1:44:28] in the rapture we we're the we're the
[1:44:31] only ones with the
[1:44:32] truth son's a kish
[1:44:35] now
[1:44:36] sons of kisha reputed among men many
[1:44:38] times
[1:44:40] honorable man
[1:44:41] so all of us
[1:44:43] he suited the people just right he was
[1:44:45] tall
[1:44:46] noble
[1:44:47] good-looking
[1:44:48] you know statue of a man head and
[1:44:50] shoulder above all the rest of them in
[1:44:53] the israel he could even listen he could
[1:44:56] even sometimes get anointed and preach a
[1:44:58] good sermon
[1:45:03] but he wasn't called of god to do it
[1:45:06] he was of the tribe of benjamin
[1:45:12] he never was god's choice he was the
[1:45:16] people's choice
[1:45:24] people
[1:45:27] aren't satisfied with god placing in his
[1:45:29] church
[1:45:30] then to be governed by the holy spirit
[1:45:32] and controlled by him they want somebody
[1:45:35] to tell them what to do
[1:45:37] they want some man some denomination
[1:45:39] some certain people to govern the church
[1:45:42] that they're not able to throw
[1:45:44] themselves completely into god's hand to
[1:45:45] be spiritual to be led by the holy ghost
[1:45:48] they and i'm quoting brother branham
[1:45:50] they want somebody to do their religion
[1:45:53] for them
[1:45:55] somebody that i tell them just how to do
[1:45:57] it and all about it
[1:46:00] that's what people want today
[1:46:02] they want somebody to do their religion
[1:46:05] for them well you know
[1:46:07] we give brother tim our tithes let him
[1:46:09] do the studying
[1:46:12] let him do the praying
[1:46:15] we you know we we make sure you know
[1:46:18] that he doesn't have to work out in
[1:46:19] secular work he can devote himself so
[1:46:22] why do i need to
[1:46:24] pray what do i need to be a spiritual
[1:46:27] man how come how come i need to listen
[1:46:29] to the tapes
[1:46:32] how come i got a witness to people out
[1:46:34] of my job and wherever you know we pay
[1:46:37] the preacher to do that
[1:46:42] you see god sent on the day of pentecost
[1:46:45] the holy ghost to rule in men's hearts
[1:46:47] and rule in their lives
[1:46:49] it was never meant for man to rule over
[1:46:51] man
[1:46:54] amen
[1:46:55] you said brother tim you mean to tell me
[1:46:57] that a pastor is not to lead his church
[1:46:59] oh yeah he is
[1:47:00] he is to lead the church by feeding them
[1:47:02] the word
[1:47:04] he's not to be king nor to claim claim
[1:47:06] to be the husband
[1:47:08] of the church
[1:47:11] and especially not the husband of
[1:47:12] individuals
[1:47:15] in the church
[1:47:17] amen but man wants to rule and that man
[1:47:19] loves to be ruled
[1:47:23] he didn't want to have god to rule him
[1:47:26] but still you see
[1:47:28] they chose a great man but it still
[1:47:30] wasn't god's way of doing him
[1:47:32] god wanted his faithful old prophet to
[1:47:34] to direct him and speak his words to
[1:47:36] them
[1:47:38] and remember in this
[1:47:40] today in the church age that we live in
[1:47:43] he said i think i believe this with all
[1:47:44] my heart we've gone exactly vice versa
[1:47:47] from what god ordained us to do the last
[1:47:50] words of our savior was mark 16 go into
[1:47:53] all the world and preach
[1:47:55] the gospel to every creature he that
[1:47:57] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[1:47:59] he that believeth not shall be damned
[1:48:01] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:48:03] believe in my name they shall cast out
[1:48:05] devils they will speak with new tongues
[1:48:07] and if they should take a serpent or
[1:48:09] drink deadly things it will not hurt
[1:48:11] them they lay their hands on the sick
[1:48:13] they shall recover
[1:48:15] and there's not a man there's no son of
[1:48:18] kiss no other one else can produce that
[1:48:21] outside of the leadership of the holy
[1:48:23] spirit
[1:48:25] our churches have gone so corruptive on
[1:48:27] the basis we're choosing our shepherds
[1:48:29] to lead us we've gone to the seminaries
[1:48:31] we've selected men with great
[1:48:33] intellectual giants men who are
[1:48:35] brilliant in their minds men who have
[1:48:37] scholarships or great mixers among the
[1:48:40] people great men in their neighborhood
[1:48:42] which i have nothing to say against men
[1:48:44] who are kind in their ways of walk
[1:48:47] careful in their ways of life how they
[1:48:49] conduct themselves among other men and
[1:48:51] among people great men in their fields
[1:48:53] which i do not speak evil of god forbid
[1:48:57] that my spirit would ever be that evil
[1:48:59] but still it isn't what god called chose
[1:49:01] for us it's the leadership of the holy
[1:49:04] spirit
[1:49:05] christ in the heart of man
[1:49:09] many of those intellectual men stand in
[1:49:11] our pulpit
[1:49:12] and they deny the real existence of the
[1:49:15] holy ghost
[1:49:18] many of them deny the existence of
[1:49:20] divine healing to the power of the
[1:49:22] spirit
[1:49:24] i'm ashamed to say we're not just
[1:49:26] talking about
[1:49:27] baptist methods presbyterian we're
[1:49:29] talking about message churches now
[1:49:32] a man sends a kiss of god in the pulpit
[1:49:34] chosen by men
[1:49:37] and and they've got they've done good
[1:49:39] things
[1:49:40] they can do great print works
[1:49:43] they can build churches
[1:49:45] they can they they can organize great
[1:49:48] movements and things like that
[1:49:50] you know even as i said be said to put
[1:49:52] to saul you will also prophesy
[1:49:55] and many of them can become great mighty
[1:49:58] preachers and can preach like archangels
[1:50:01] but still it isn't god's will
[1:50:04] god was to be their king
[1:50:09] and brother sister you let the holy
[1:50:11] spirit lead you
[1:50:14] amen
[1:50:15] he sent the holy spirit
[1:50:18] but he said god sent the holy spirit and
[1:50:20] he's to be our guide he's to be our
[1:50:22] leader but when they see the holy spirit
[1:50:25] moving
[1:50:26] they get scared of it
[1:50:30] it's a stranger to them because they've
[1:50:33] never been taught in that line
[1:50:35] they're taught just a certain church
[1:50:37] what it believes and go through life
[1:50:39] calling themselves christians and going
[1:50:41] with the things of the world and and
[1:50:43] when they die they say well my faith
[1:50:45] saves me
[1:50:48] said i said to a man one time sir don't
[1:50:51] the lord ever condemn you for that
[1:50:52] smoking say oh no no
[1:50:55] no wait a minute
[1:50:57] you think oh this is baptist methodist
[1:51:00] i know of trustees and officials in
[1:51:03] churches that are smokers
[1:51:04] message churches
[1:51:08] he said oh oh no he said i've seen you
[1:51:10] drink myself but he said look here
[1:51:12] preacher i want to tell you something
[1:51:14] i visited another man in the room he
[1:51:16] said my face saves me i said but mister
[1:51:18] let me tell you something now faith
[1:51:20] without works is dead
[1:51:23] no holy spirit don't live a life like
[1:51:25] that
[1:51:26] and i said you may be disappointed
[1:51:28] i said now the faith is all right but
[1:51:30] the works don't follow that faith your
[1:51:31] faith is no
[1:51:32] good and when you die remember it
[1:51:35] doesn't change your spirit it only
[1:51:36] changes your dwelling place
[1:51:38] and whatever type of sphere you go in
[1:51:41] you that's a place it will it will um
[1:51:45] it'll that's a place it will go to and
[1:51:46] sin can never enter heaven you say well
[1:51:49] i confess mine every night
[1:51:54] that's where people are i'm just in the
[1:51:56] flesh you know i've got this flesh and i
[1:51:58] can't help it this this whole flesh and
[1:52:00] besides that you know i confess my sins
[1:52:02] every night
[1:52:04] we've got a prayer book and when we go
[1:52:06] to church we confess all our sins and
[1:52:08] turn it right back around he said and do
[1:52:10] them again
[1:52:12] turn right back the next day and say god
[1:52:14] forgive me for drinking forgive me for
[1:52:15] committing adultery forgive me for lying
[1:52:17] forgive me for stealing and turn right
[1:52:19] back around do the same thing
[1:52:22] forgive me for getting drunk last week i
[1:52:23] didn't mean to drink that much and turn
[1:52:25] right back around and drink again
[1:52:29] well that shows something hasn't changed
[1:52:31] inside
[1:52:33] you're trying to paint the outside kind
[1:52:35] of whitewash it but what needs done is
[1:52:38] put on the blood of jesus christ and
[1:52:40] wash white instead of white wasps
[1:52:44] amen now this is what brother branham
[1:52:46] said many people want him as savior to
[1:52:48] keep them from going to hell but they
[1:52:50] don't want to be the lord of their lives
[1:52:54] to be the governor to be the ruler
[1:52:57] they don't want him meddling in their
[1:52:58] private business
[1:53:04] well you know with israel
[1:53:05] they get a message
[1:53:07] i don't remember now was it from the
[1:53:10] amorites who sends out and said well i
[1:53:13] tell you what we're going to do
[1:53:15] we're going to put out the right eye of
[1:53:17] every one of god's people
[1:53:20] we're going to go you're going to serve
[1:53:22] us
[1:53:23] and we're going to put out every one of
[1:53:24] your right eyes
[1:53:26] and brother brethren said that's the one
[1:53:28] that's spiritual
[1:53:31] if he can put the spiritual side out of
[1:53:33] your eye where you see the natural and
[1:53:35] not the spiritual things
[1:53:38] he's got your whip right there as long
[1:53:40] as you can have churches and big places
[1:53:42] and find intellectual dressed people and
[1:53:44] some more as long as your eye looks like
[1:53:46] that and you don't see the don't see the
[1:53:48] spirit inside the enemy's got you under
[1:53:50] control because you don't know where
[1:53:51] you're going
[1:53:53] and i'll tell you that's the problem
[1:53:55] today because of a lack of an
[1:53:58] old-fashioned sin killing backwoods
[1:54:00] religion
[1:54:02] sin killing revival amen bible holy
[1:54:05] ghost back in the church you've got a
[1:54:07] lot of people with a right eye out they
[1:54:09] don't have a spiritual eye all they can
[1:54:12] see is natural things well god's
[1:54:14] blessing me here and god's blessed me
[1:54:16] there
[1:54:18] and god gave us this beautiful church
[1:54:20] and we got a great ministry
[1:54:26] but it's got to be something that brings
[1:54:27] the power of god back in the church
[1:54:30] amen the spirit of god moving on the
[1:54:32] audience people filled with the holy
[1:54:34] ghost
[1:54:35] and remember
[1:54:37] the first time not the second time but
[1:54:40] the first time
[1:54:41] that saul reached up and decided he was
[1:54:44] going to offer the sacrifice
[1:54:46] are you with me and he moves on out of
[1:54:48] his position out of this place
[1:54:51] come on and the first time that he got
[1:54:54] you know that the people started being
[1:54:55] led by man instead of god the holy ghost
[1:54:58] goes right away from you and god left
[1:55:00] saul right there
[1:55:02] amen and you know what you know they
[1:55:04] become just like a bunch of confused
[1:55:07] people now
[1:55:08] they're living a defeated life they're
[1:55:10] still perpetuating the church ages just
[1:55:12] start going down into failure
[1:55:16] brother branham liking it to like an old
[1:55:18] gander that led a bunch of geese out of
[1:55:19] canada
[1:55:20] he wound up over there in england
[1:55:22] somewhere
[1:55:23] you know and they they were they've
[1:55:25] never been able to come back they'll
[1:55:26] just circle around and around and honk
[1:55:29] and honk and it comes time to to go back
[1:55:31] to their lands and that nobody knows
[1:55:33] where to go
[1:55:34] and he said it puts me in mind of some
[1:55:36] of these former marbs
[1:55:38] these formal cold formal morgues
[1:55:42] i hope that don't describe your church
[1:55:45] amen
[1:55:46] get so far back away from god you don't
[1:55:48] know how to get back
[1:55:50] you you can't come back by creeds you've
[1:55:52] got to have inspiration to lead your
[1:55:54] brother and that inspiration comes by
[1:55:56] the holy ghost let of the spirit sons of
[1:55:59] daughters of god are led by the spirit
[1:56:01] of god they love the spirit
[1:56:03] they don't try to say no wait a minute
[1:56:05] my church don't say amen
[1:56:09] that describes a lot of message churches
[1:56:11] now
[1:56:12] my church they never raise their hands
[1:56:15] they're very quiet
[1:56:16] why we'd give our pastor chills and
[1:56:19] fever if somebody hollered amen
[1:56:23] well brother brandon said you ought to
[1:56:24] chill him up every once in a while
[1:56:28] amen he said what we need today is a
[1:56:30] good old heartfelt religion
[1:56:33] let me tell you something if a baby's
[1:56:34] born the baby don't cry if it don't
[1:56:36] whine but don't open his little mouth
[1:56:38] and say a thing nothing happened you
[1:56:40] know what's the matter with the baby
[1:56:41] he's born dead
[1:56:44] he's i think we got too many still
[1:56:46] births today in the church
[1:56:48] oh you say brother tim that was back in
[1:56:50] the 50s brother branham was preaching
[1:56:52] that after the seals in the tree and the
[1:56:54] easter seal brother madam uses the same
[1:56:57] analogy he said we got too many
[1:56:59] stillborn babies in the church
[1:57:07] he said why he said you have one born
[1:57:09] like that he said what do you do a good
[1:57:11] doctor he'll take and spat him on the
[1:57:13] rear like that until he gets him
[1:57:16] screaming out
[1:57:18] he called that a good gospel
[1:57:21] protoplasm stimulation
[1:57:24] amen that's what he call it
[1:57:27] amen a good paddling once a while
[1:57:30] amen to where sin is preached so hard
[1:57:32] against and people realize i need jesus
[1:57:36] and their conviction in the house of god
[1:57:38] and people weep their way to calvary
[1:57:43] we're talking about old-time religion
[1:57:45] now
[1:57:46] we don't want it no more
[1:57:48] well the next thing he says
[1:57:50] you know he sends out a proclamation
[1:57:53] and he says follow me
[1:57:55] whoever don't follow me and samuel
[1:57:59] well you heard brother branham say that
[1:58:01] well you see they want to still identify
[1:58:03] with the true prophet of god
[1:58:06] but but saul did it to get them to
[1:58:08] follow him
[1:58:11] so therefore using a few select quotes
[1:58:15] from a true prophet
[1:58:17] they deny anointed preachers
[1:58:20] they deny gifts of the spirit they deny
[1:58:23] genuine experiences they deny speaking
[1:58:26] in tongues
[1:58:29] well
[1:58:30] everybody who speaks with tongues aren't
[1:58:32] saved
[1:58:33] well it's true some of them are just
[1:58:35] sounding brass and tinkling symbols
[1:58:38] amen but some are true
[1:58:41] and there is a genuine holy ghost
[1:58:43] speaking in tongues it's always supposed
[1:58:45] to be in the church
[1:58:46] that's from standing in the gap
[1:58:48] amen brother branham which uh brother
[1:58:50] branham tells us that but but let me
[1:58:52] just tell you don't just go on one side
[1:58:55] of this
[1:58:57] say well everybody that you know you
[1:58:59] know we got to have love brother tim you
[1:59:01] know we'd rather have love and because
[1:59:03] you could speak in tongues like men and
[1:59:05] angels
[1:59:06] yeah
[1:59:07] but you could also know all the
[1:59:09] mysteries
[1:59:15] you could also know all the mysteries
[1:59:17] come and preach the other side of it too
[1:59:21] so if you want to preach against
[1:59:23] speaking in tongues preach against some
[1:59:24] mysteries too
[1:59:27] come on
[1:59:29] amen i believe that we ought to have the
[1:59:30] mysteries
[1:59:32] but you can know all the mysteries
[1:59:34] and still lack the love of god that's
[1:59:36] his basic nature
[1:59:38] so they said let all the people follow
[1:59:40] me and samuel see he used the prophet's
[1:59:44] reputation
[1:59:46] to deceive the people
[1:59:48] do you know to go around and
[1:59:51] can you imagine using the prophet's own
[1:59:54] words to try to make him support two
[1:59:58] gods
[1:59:59] two lords two jehovah's two jesus
[2:00:05] using the prophet's own word to try to
[2:00:08] make him say the seven thunders are the
[2:00:10] seven virtues
[2:00:12] that's what sons of kiss do
[2:00:15] amen that's that's what they do but then
[2:00:18] when it comes around to genuine
[2:00:19] experience they don't want nobody to
[2:00:21] have that
[2:00:23] no sir
[2:00:24] you know the evidence the holy ghost is
[2:00:27] receiving what i preach
[2:00:32] and the first thing you know
[2:00:34] he's kicking christ is kicked out of the
[2:00:36] church the king is rejected now i'm
[2:00:38] going over time right now
[2:00:40] and i know you've been hearing all day
[2:00:42] and this you're tired
[2:00:44] but i preached this morning you listened
[2:00:50] you know john watson wesley he was
[2:00:51] preaching divine healing
[2:00:56] you know and now now today the methodist
[2:00:59] church denies it
[2:01:02] here's a here's a page from john
[2:01:04] wesley's diary in the late 1700s sunday
[2:01:07] morning may the 5th i preached and said
[2:01:10] saint ann's was asked not to come back
[2:01:12] again
[2:01:14] sunday p.m on may the 5th i preached to
[2:01:16] saint john's and deacon said get out and
[2:01:19] stay out

[2:01:25] go back there either
[2:01:28] sunday p.m may the 12th the priest at
[2:01:30] saint george's and was kicked out again
[2:01:34] sunday am may the 19th and preached it
[2:01:37] saint somebody else's and the deacons
[2:01:39] called a special meeting and said i
[2:01:40] couldn't return
[2:01:42] sunday p.m i preached on the street and
[2:01:44] i got kicked off the street
[2:01:46] sunday 8 a.m may the 26th i preached in
[2:01:50] a matter and chased out of the matter as
[2:01:52] the bull was turned loose during the
[2:01:53] service
[2:01:55] sunday a.m june the second i preached on
[2:01:58] the edge of town i was kicked off the
[2:02:00] highway
[2:02:01] 70 p.m june the 2nd the afternoon
[2:02:04] service i preached in the pastor 10 000
[2:02:06] people came to hear me
[2:02:10] somebody's going to hear the word
[2:02:12] and a real gospel preacher ain't going
[2:02:14] to give up
[2:02:16] amen he's going to keep preaching the
[2:02:18] word no matter how many times the king
[2:02:20] is rejected
[2:02:22] now brother branham talked about billy
[2:02:24] graham he calls him by name he said he's
[2:02:26] the son of kish
[2:02:28] you see he was never called of god
[2:02:30] he was never out of the right tribe
[2:02:33] he was educated head and shoulder above
[2:02:36] all others a fine man a challenger of
[2:02:38] evangelism and a child
[2:02:41] challenged him
[2:02:42] and when the challenged him
[2:02:44] and said if your god is god let him heal
[2:02:46] the sick like he said he would do
[2:02:48] and the son of kiss with the rest of the
[2:02:50] army quaking himself left the country
[2:02:52] defeated
[2:02:54] amen it's a disgrace our god is god
[2:02:58] one of the sons of kiss head and
[2:02:59] shoulders above all the other
[2:03:01] evangelists called by muhammad and the
[2:03:03] other day challenged to the word of god
[2:03:05] trembled in his shoes and left the
[2:03:06] ground what's the matter it's something
[2:03:09] besides theology it has to bring the
[2:03:11] supernatural power of god and do it he
[2:03:14] knew nothing about it same as in the
[2:03:16] days of saul
[2:03:19] and i wonder today even ain't the same
[2:03:21] we got good churches we got lots of
[2:03:24] people and big crowds and lots of money
[2:03:26] and you know we we can we can uh
[2:03:29] evangelize and we can send books out and
[2:03:32] we can build churches but i say where's
[2:03:34] the power of god
[2:03:36] where is divine healing amen where is
[2:03:39] salvation for the soul where is the
[2:03:42] power pouring out of the holy ghost
[2:03:44] where is it that the king is king
[2:03:47] lord of lord and king of kings
[2:03:51] his word remains
[2:03:54] supreme but all
[2:03:57] in this time
[2:04:00] while saul
[2:04:02] was building his army
[2:04:05] while saul was trying to establish his
[2:04:08] kingship
[2:04:10] when he was trying to get ready to pass
[2:04:12] it on down to his sons and he was
[2:04:13] grooming his sons
[2:04:15] we're going to be the king over israel
[2:04:17] and out of our lineage and we'll have an
[2:04:20] intellectual kingdom that i'll be
[2:04:22] greater than the others
[2:04:24] while all of that is going on
[2:04:27] i want you to know what happened
[2:04:29] an evil spirit from the presence of god
[2:04:32] came on the man
[2:04:34] god sent an evil spirit because if the
[2:04:37] you won't let the holy spirit lead
[2:04:39] he'll send an evil spirit to lead you
[2:04:44] come on
[2:04:45] amen and when we see the same thing an
[2:04:47] evil spirit that'll say days of miracles
[2:04:50] are passed
[2:04:51] an evil spirit that says well you know
[2:04:54] we just believe the message and we're we
[2:04:56] got the holy ghost an evil spirit
[2:04:59] scoffers in the last days
[2:05:01] souls rising up
[2:05:03] somebody with me amen led by an evil
[2:05:06] spirit that would say evil about the
[2:05:09] movement of the holy ghost that will
[2:05:11] condemn a youth camp like ours
[2:05:14] said well i'll tell you it's changed
[2:05:16] brother tim i'll tell you how it started
[2:05:18] it started out amen
[2:05:20] in our meeting there at
[2:05:22] clara springs louisiana let me tell you
[2:05:24] how it started out it started out with
[2:05:27] the move of the holy ghost donnie reagan
[2:05:30] preaching in the pulpit and he's
[2:05:32] preaching the word and the power of god
[2:05:34] hit young people and the thousands were
[2:05:36] full and they wept their way to calvary
[2:05:39] and they shouted and they danced up and
[2:05:41] down the aisles
[2:05:44] and their lives were changed and many of
[2:05:46] the men and women are still change lives
[2:05:49] today
[2:05:54] wasn't no intellectual meeting
[2:05:57] we're not going to have an intellectual
[2:05:59] meeting
[2:06:00] and i'll tell you if that's what you
[2:06:01] want and that's what you call insane and
[2:06:04] sensible keep your kids home
[2:06:07] we're going to have the holy ghost move
[2:06:10] we're going to have the king
[2:06:12] we're going to have the power of god
[2:06:14] we're going to have the holy ghost
[2:06:16] poured out we're going to see young
[2:06:18] people transformed by the power of god
[2:06:21] we're not going to teach psychology
[2:06:24] we're going to teach them some neology
[2:06:26] where they cut down and meet god and
[2:06:28] their lives were changed and not
[2:06:30] reformed but transformed
[2:06:34] but all
[2:06:35] while this were happening
[2:06:38] there was
[2:06:40] a little david
[2:06:42] out there with the sheep
[2:06:46] unnoticed
[2:06:49] his daddy didn't even recognize him
[2:06:52] he's just out there among the sheep
[2:06:55] but while
[2:06:56] he was out there among the sheep
[2:06:59] a lion of a cancer come
[2:07:04] on
[2:07:04] hallelujah
[2:07:06] a lion of a cancer came
[2:07:09] but you see
[2:07:10] little david was not assault
[2:07:14] he had been anointed he oh as he was
[2:07:17] singing it the anointing was on his
[2:07:19] songs
[2:07:20] the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
[2:07:24] i will not fear the arrows by day or the
[2:07:27] arrows by night i i will not fear even
[2:07:31] though i walk through the valley of the
[2:07:32] shadow of death i'll fear no evil here
[2:07:35] comes roar of a cancer comes get one of
[2:07:38] his flock
[2:07:41] amen david didn't run and hide like saul
[2:07:46] amen he wasn't no coward he said god
[2:07:49] sent me and there ain't no devil going
[2:07:52] to take no child of god
[2:07:54] out on my watch
[2:07:56] amen the prayer of faith shall save the
[2:07:58] second god shall raise them up
[2:08:00] amen hallelujah a little david has said
[2:08:04] when the enemy comes in tasked one of
[2:08:06] our young people and pull them down in
[2:08:09] pornography and sin we're not gonna let
[2:08:11] that happen on our watch
[2:08:15] hallelujah there's gonna be a praying
[2:08:17] church there's gonna be a people with a
[2:08:20] slingshot of faith there's going to be a
[2:08:22] people that knows how to put the name of
[2:08:25] jesus in their slang and let it go
[2:08:31] hallelujah
[2:08:34] hallelujah in the middle of all this
[2:08:37] god's bringing forth the king
[2:08:39] and i'll tell you in the midst of
[2:08:41] laodicea in the midst of the confusion
[2:08:44] god's bringing forth the king
[2:08:49] the lord of lords
[2:08:51] the king of kings
[2:08:54] leading them by still waters
[2:08:56] and green pastures
[2:08:58] mindful of father's sheep
[2:09:01] and he knows the power of god to deliver
[2:09:03] them
[2:09:05] god's still got david somewhere
[2:09:09] he got men of god somewhere oh i'm
[2:09:11] thankful i know many of them
[2:09:13] are many a little david's that are out
[2:09:15] there
[2:09:16] they may be overlooked but they're true
[2:09:18] shepherds
[2:09:20] that feeds them jesus christ the same
[2:09:22] yesterday today and forever
[2:09:24] and if the enemy comes and grabs one of
[2:09:26] them he knows the power of god
[2:09:29] there's one thing i'll tell you i may
[2:09:31] not know the philosophy
[2:09:33] i may not know psychology
[2:09:35] i don't care one bit about all of the
[2:09:38] man's ideas
[2:09:40] but there's one thing i know
[2:09:42] when the enemy come in after one of our
[2:09:44] sheep
[2:09:45] we took the slingshot of faith against
[2:09:47] it
[2:09:48] and we'll do it again and again and
[2:09:51] bring them safely back to health again
[2:09:55] we need the leadership of the holy ghost
[2:09:58] and i just want to warn every son of
[2:10:01] kiss
[2:10:03] that is out there throwing your spears
[2:10:05] throwing your javelins
[2:10:07] at the anointing of god you're doing
[2:10:09] this because you received an evil spirit
[2:10:12] instead of the holy spirit
[2:10:15] because when a man rejects the
[2:10:17] leadership of the holy spirit
[2:10:19] god gave him an evil spirit to lead him
[2:10:23] so when a man rejects the leading of the
[2:10:25] holy spirit a person rejects the leading
[2:10:28] of the holy spirit you've got a devil on
[2:10:30] you
[2:10:31] and i just want to bear witness if you
[2:10:33] hear one lashing out and dancing in the
[2:10:35] spirit
[2:10:36] or this emotion calling it
[2:10:38] pentecostalism
[2:10:39] i will tell you why they are throwing
[2:10:42] the spears
[2:10:44] because they have taken on an evil
[2:10:46] spirit
[2:10:47] and become a part of the scoffers in the
[2:10:49] last day
[2:10:50] instead of a part of the shout
[2:10:56] brother branham said this
[2:10:58] notice that when his presence is near
[2:11:01] certainly it brings emotion
[2:11:04] anything without emotion is dead and
[2:11:07] any religion that hasn't got some
[2:11:09] emotion to it you better bury it is dead
[2:11:12] it brings emotion
[2:11:15] everywhere jesus is
[2:11:17] there's a lot of noise
[2:11:20] where god is it makes a lot of noise i
[2:11:23] don't know why it is but to do but
[2:11:24] anything without noise without emotion
[2:11:26] is dead that scientific is your religion
[2:11:29] and got a little emotion to it you
[2:11:31] better bury it because it's certainly
[2:11:33] dead
[2:11:35] god hates
[2:11:37] a powerless
[2:11:38] religion
[2:11:40] it's got to have power
[2:11:43] it's a power to save a man from sin and
[2:11:46] we've seen it
[2:11:49] i could call him by name those that were
[2:11:52] out in horrible sins and trespasses
[2:11:56] amen but it's a power to save from sins
[2:11:58] it's a power to do signs and wonders
[2:12:02] we've seen epilepsy cast out
[2:12:06] amen we've seen demons have to flee
[2:12:09] we've in tormented spirits have to leave
[2:12:12] amen we've seen cancers go
[2:12:15] we've seen eyes be healed
[2:12:18] we've seen thy beat is healed
[2:12:21] we've seen miracles we've seen signs
[2:12:23] because we serve a living god because
[2:12:26] god wants to perform
[2:12:29] god wants to show himself alive
[2:12:36] god wants divine healing among his
[2:12:38] people
[2:12:41] but yet we tell those days pass it's not
[2:12:44] the season for it
[2:12:49] i got a video of a man
[2:12:52] who played who
[2:12:53] is a good man
[2:12:55] he's a great son of kiss
[2:12:58] saying you know well
[2:13:00] it's just not the seal of season for
[2:13:02] divine healing
[2:13:04] and we get a miracle
[2:13:05] hope for one now and then but just think
[2:13:07] the season for it
[2:13:09] well when's it going to be
[2:13:13] when did god quit the healing business
[2:13:17] i'll tell you when same time you quit
[2:13:18] the saving business
[2:13:20] if you don't save you don't heal
[2:13:23] salvation on the body is the same as
[2:13:26] salvation on the soul once it's the soul
[2:13:28] around the others the body realm
[2:13:31] amen so there's going to be salvation
[2:13:34] on the soul there has to be salvation
[2:13:37] for the body
[2:13:39] amen
[2:13:40] you see
[2:13:42] but it comes down to the point
[2:13:44] well we don't want that no more
[2:13:47] we
[2:13:48] want
[2:13:49] something more reformed is he sane and

[2:27:45] we have the wine that is the kosher wine
[2:27:47] for passover
[2:27:49] represents the god the blood of jesus
[2:27:52] christ
[2:27:53] it's not grape juice and light bread
[2:27:57] it's not someone's sanctified or unholy
[2:27:59] thing we're going to dedicate it to god
[2:28:02] and you dedicate yourself as you take it
[2:28:05] now as you take it
[2:28:09] you will walk right down toward those
[2:28:11] devil doors
[2:28:13] to the right hand side
[2:28:15] will be the men over in this hall
[2:28:17] there's chairs set up with basins for
[2:28:19] you to wash one another's feet
[2:28:22] over here the ladies will do
[2:28:24] it now
[2:28:27] i know there's sometimes there's elderly
[2:28:29] in the handicapped and you can't
[2:28:31] get down and wash feet we understand
[2:28:34] god understands
[2:28:38] don't try to make this a law we're under
[2:28:41] grace
[2:28:42] god knows your heart he knows you would
[2:28:44] be right down there doing it if you
[2:28:46] could
[2:28:48] but i pray tonight
[2:28:50] that you'll realize there's healing in
[2:28:52] the cup
[2:28:53] and in the communion
[2:28:55] and as you take it
[2:28:57] that you'll claim your healing for your
[2:28:59] body
[2:29:00] or even for your wounded spirit
[2:29:04] or healing wherever it's needed
[2:29:07] now i'm going to go down now
[2:29:09] and i'm going to read the scripture
[2:29:11] in a moment
[2:29:12] we'll put on a different type of music
[2:29:15] let the musicians take a part in this
[2:29:18] service
[2:29:19] in fact
[2:29:21] i'm going to dismiss them now
[2:29:23] i'm going to ask the brothers if they'll
[2:29:25] come
[2:29:26] down to me right now
[2:29:28] as we come to the table of the lord
[2:29:32] and as we we bring this i'm going to
[2:29:34] read the scripture to you
[2:29:36] and then i'm going to let you have your
[2:29:38] seats
[2:29:39] first corinthians 11 23 for i received
[2:29:42] of the lord that which also i delivered
[2:29:43] unto you
[2:29:45] that the lord jesus the same night in
[2:29:47] which he was betrayed took bread and
[2:29:49] when he had given thanks he break it
[2:29:51] and said take heed this is my body which
[2:29:53] is broken for you
[2:29:55] it's due in remembrance of me and after
[2:29:57] the same manner also he took the cup
[2:30:00] which he had sept say in this cup
[2:30:02] is the new testament in my blood
[2:30:05] this do you as often as you drink it in
[2:30:07] remembrance of me
[2:30:08] for as often as you eat this bread and
[2:30:11] drink this cup you just show the lord's
[2:30:14] death till he come
[2:30:15] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[2:30:18] and drink this cup of the lord and
[2:30:19] worthily shall be guilty of the body and
[2:30:22] the blood of the lord but let a man
[2:30:23] examine himself
[2:30:25] and so let him eat of that bread and
[2:30:27] drink of that cup
[2:30:28] for he that eateth and drinketh
[2:30:30] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[2:30:32] to himself
[2:30:34] not discerning
[2:30:36] the lord's body not realizing we're not
[2:30:39] here playing church this is serious
[2:30:41] business
[2:30:42] for this cause
[2:30:44] many are sick and weakly among us
[2:30:48] are weak and sickly among us and some
[2:30:50] are dead
[2:30:52] for if we would judge ourselves we
[2:30:54] should not be judged
[2:30:56] for when we are judged we are chastened
[2:30:58] to the lord that we should not be
[2:30:59] condemned with the world
[2:31:01] wherefore my brethren when you come
[2:31:03] together
[2:31:05] to eat
[2:31:06] carry
[2:31:07] one for another
[2:31:09] god bless you you can have your seats
[2:31:12] if you were taking just turn on this
[2:31:14] soft music just for a moment
[2:31:17] i'm just going to prepare the table of
[2:31:19] the lord
[2:31:48] i know
[2:31:48] [Music]
[2:31:50] there's a lot of different questions a
[2:31:51] lot of different ideas
[2:31:53] brother branham used the tray when his
[2:31:56] church was small he used the cup
[2:31:59] but this all came from one vessel
[2:32:02] it represents a multi a multi-membered
[2:32:04] body
[2:32:06] you can even see on the tape where
[2:32:07] brother branham used to tray
[2:32:10] i realize
[2:32:12] that some people get very very
[2:32:14] legalistic
[2:32:16] they say we must all drink out of one
[2:32:18] cup
[2:32:19] to be doing this scripturally
[2:32:21] but if that's so then we must all wash
[2:32:25] in one foot washing pan and use one
[2:32:27] towel for everybody here
[2:32:30] this is not about legalism
[2:32:33] this is about a sacred service to the
[2:32:36] lord
[2:32:38] now we're going to pray
[2:32:41] father
[2:32:43] i want to thank you for this that
[2:32:44] represents your breath your body and
[2:32:47] your blood
[2:32:49] i want you to thank you lord for the
[2:32:51] blood of christ that forgives us of all
[2:32:53] sins
[2:32:55] and that our sins are under the blood
[2:32:58] i want to thank you lord for this wine
[2:33:01] and this bread
[2:33:02] i want you to tonight lord
[2:33:05] to come in that marvelous way and reveal
[2:33:07] yourself personally to each one
[2:33:10] and as they take the communion
[2:33:12] for them to resolve in their heart
[2:33:14] this day starts a new communion with you
[2:33:18] a new fellowship a greater love than
[2:33:20] i've ever had before
[2:33:22] that you be king
[2:33:23] of my life
[2:33:25] in jesus name
[2:33:27] amen
[2:33:28] and like i said the deacons
[2:33:31] will be calling
[2:33:32] first the musicians because they'll be
[2:33:34] coming back
[2:33:36] for the for the service
[2:33:38] what you will do is when you come from
[2:33:40] foot washing you come right back into
[2:33:42] the auditorium
[2:33:43] together for the dismissal
[2:33:46] so
[2:33:46] it works just really perfectly as we
[2:33:48] come

[2:33:53] to meet you here as you fulfill his word
[2:33:59] okay
