[1:01:33] that's come so far to to make these
[1:01:36] things possible I know some of you have
[1:01:38] invested a lot of money in that seat
[1:01:40] that you're sitting in amen that you
[1:01:43] know God will reward you greatly amen
[1:01:46] for all the sacrifices that you've made
[1:01:49] and we won't appreciate my brother Tim
[1:01:51] this morning I do want to say that we
[1:01:53] greatly appreciate him making this kind
[1:01:55] of meeting possible
[1:01:57] [Music]
[1:01:57] [Applause]
[1:02:01] [Music]
[1:02:07] I know that he's got musicians and
[1:02:10] ministering teams brother Timothy here
[1:02:12] is an associate these men of God undo
[1:02:15] audio the Deacons and trustees and all
[1:02:18] these things are made possible but you
[1:02:20] know it's written in the scripture and
[1:02:21] the random tells that he said that the
[1:02:23] Holy Ghost was bound about treats and
[1:02:24] doggies for 2,000 years he said but in
[1:02:28] the latter days that would be let loose
[1:02:30] now what does that really mean there was
[1:02:33] nothing wrong with the Holy Ghost but
[1:02:34] Creed's and darkness and traditions had
[1:02:36] bound it but there's going to come some
[1:02:39] people in the end time it's going to
[1:02:41] take the traditions and the creeds and
[1:02:43] the binds and they're going to throw
[1:02:44] them away and say holy spirit have your
[1:02:46] way and gods give us some elders that
[1:02:49] believe that and thank God for our
[1:02:52] elders who believe these kinds of things
[1:02:54] remain and belong in the Church of the
[1:02:57] Living God because the intellectuals
[1:03:04] would take these things away from you if
[1:03:05] you'd let them but God does give us
[1:03:07] elders that says no these things belong
[1:03:10] in the church this is the property of
[1:03:13] the bride of Jesus Christ amen and we
[1:03:14] think want for them today and I want to
[1:03:17] say that it's been a great privilege to
[1:03:18] share the platform of these men that
[1:03:20] have preached this message with without
[1:03:22] favor but with power amen and I know
[1:03:24] that many of you gonna go home with
[1:03:26] stories and testimonies all these things
[1:03:30] surely it's a great honor amen and we
[1:03:33] have my father-in-law mother-in-law and
[1:03:35] Vernon DD with us they go to brother
[1:03:37] Jason Jackson's good to have him here
[1:03:39] from Arkansas and man and you know it's
[1:03:43] always a blessing some of you I know
[1:03:44] that you heard the curses of in-laws
[1:03:46] well it's not all truth
[1:03:48] because I got good in-laws so it tells
[1:03:51] you that that that is possible that you
[1:03:53] can have a tremendous relationship and
[1:03:55] and my family here with me my wife
[1:03:57] Karissa she's a tremendous lady and we
[1:04:01] sure appreciate her traveling with us
[1:04:03] and it's a lot of sacrifice but she's
[1:04:05] done it for years and I know there has
[1:04:07] to be a special crown in heaven for her
[1:04:09] amen for all of her sacrifices and we
[1:04:13] want to just for a moment to balance and
[1:04:16] let's just speak to the Lord father it
[1:04:20] has been such a tremendous time Lord a
[1:04:26] vibration of praise and honor to be your
[1:04:32] children just runs through our veins to
[1:04:34] think that we could be the children of
[1:04:35] God like you a great God of heaven
[1:04:39] whether far to get powering when the
[1:04:42] enemy would do is hurt Lord you have
[1:04:45] rose up and put your hand against it and
[1:04:47] what we're so thankful to be able to
[1:04:50] come here and gather with children and
[1:04:52] my precious faith and the Lord to cry on
[1:04:56] the altars and to share our tears and
[1:04:58] our hearts and Lord and then to rejoice
[1:05:01] together and to feel the victories of
[1:05:03] one another's over Cummings and father
[1:05:06] what an hour that it is even this
[1:05:08] morning but it's only a reflection of
[1:05:10] what it would be someday when we stack
[1:05:13] up our arms and the battles are all over
[1:05:15] and we set down in heaven and Lord we'll
[1:05:18] sit there and talk it over for ten
[1:05:20] thousand years of the victories and what
[1:05:22] you've done in our midst O Lord and we
[1:05:25] pray this morning father as we have
[1:05:27] gathered in this building
[1:05:28] that Nord that you will rebuke every
[1:05:31] spirit of unbelief and fear and
[1:05:34] ungodliness that holds your children I
[1:05:36] pray that the spirit of Liberty would so
[1:05:39] strike this building God that there not
[1:05:41] be one left without liberty this morning
[1:05:44] but father may ever woman man child may
[1:05:48] ever tradition and creep be broken from
[1:05:51] their mind that they would have a
[1:05:52] Liberty to rejoice and move into the
[1:05:55] glories that you have prepared for them
[1:05:57] I ask you this morning that you would
[1:06:00] bless them bless the audience that is
[1:06:01] visible and them that are invisible
[1:06:03] father I pray that you bless each one of
[1:06:06] them today father we ask these things
[1:06:08] now in the name of Jesus Christ we pray
[1:06:11] a man and a man and may God bless you as
[1:06:16] you have your Bibles today from the Book
[1:06:18] of Luke we want to read here the Book of
[1:06:22] Luke from the tenth chapter certainly
[1:06:27] want to say that we want to say God
[1:06:31] bless you and from brother ray Erikson
[1:06:34] and the church there in Bluffton amen
[1:06:36] I'm here I'm supposed to be giving
[1:06:39] greetings sometimes I forget it
[1:06:41] I have all these things and if I talk
[1:06:43] very long I forget so much and but I
[1:06:45] want to definitely say God bless you
[1:06:47] from the church there Luke chapter 10
[1:06:50] and the 20th the verse of course this is
[1:06:57] Jesus speaking you know I was saying the
[1:07:01] 20th first let's just back up and read
[1:07:02] here from the 17th verse and the 70
[1:07:06] returned again with joy saying Lord even
[1:07:08] the Devils are subject unto us through
[1:07:12] thy name and he said unto them I beheld
[1:07:15] Satan as lightning falling from heaven
[1:07:19] for behold I give unto you power to
[1:07:21] tread upon the serpents and scorpions
[1:07:23] and over all the power of the enemy and
[1:07:26] nothing shall by any means hurt you
[1:07:31] notwithstanding in this rejoice not that
[1:07:35] the spirits are subject unto you but
[1:07:38] rather rejoice because your names are
[1:07:41] written and have
[1:07:42] in that hour Jesus rejoiced in the
[1:07:46] spirit I don't know if you remember last
[1:07:49] year brother brother Ronald being
[1:07:51] pointed that out that Jesus rejoiced in
[1:07:54] spirits the first time I've noticed that
[1:07:55] in the scripture actually all these
[1:07:56] years because I've just never thought
[1:07:58] about Jesus shouting to be honest but if
[1:08:03] you want to go read the Greek it
[1:08:04] actually means to leap with joy now I
[1:08:09] know that don't go well with Baptist
[1:08:11] theology but it's in the Bible that
[1:08:13] Jesus leaped with a joy kind of got to
[1:08:17] be careful how you think about it now
[1:08:18] aren't you Jesus did that rejoiced in
[1:08:22] the spirit and said I thank thee O
[1:08:25] Father the Lord of Heaven and Earth that
[1:08:27] thou has hid these things from the wise
[1:08:31] and prudent and thou has revealed in
[1:08:34] that amazing brother mem uses this a lot
[1:08:36] in the message has revealed them unto
[1:08:39] babes even so the father for it seemed
[1:08:42] good in thy sight and all things are
[1:08:43] delivered to me of my father and no man
[1:08:45] knoweth who the son is but the father
[1:08:47] and who the father is but the son and to
[1:08:50] whom the son will reveal him and he
[1:08:53] turned again unto his disciples and said
[1:08:55] privately blessed are the eyes which see
[1:08:59] these things that you see we ask the
[1:09:03] Lord to bless his word as you may be
[1:09:05] seated I want to speak to you just for a
[1:09:08] minute this morning rejoice your names
[1:09:13] are written in heaven
[1:09:15] rejoice your names are written in heaven
[1:09:20] it did amazing that the the book is
[1:09:23] actually in heaven the prophet uses this
[1:09:28] scripture in Luke chapter 10 the church
[1:09:29] age book is very got a got a tremendous
[1:09:31] riding on it and you'll have to go read
[1:09:33] it because there's much more than I
[1:09:34] could cover in this service this morning
[1:09:37] but one thing that we know for sure
[1:09:38] according to Jesus that the names were
[1:09:40] written in the book was in heaven now
[1:09:43] one thing we want to make sure of is
[1:09:45] that in the scripture Jesus is not
[1:09:48] saying that we don't have power over the
[1:09:49] devil's because he's actually said I've
[1:09:52] beheld Satan fallen from heaven as
[1:09:54] lightning so he's actually telling us
[1:09:56] that Satan has actually fell from his
[1:09:58] position as the son start taking their
[1:10:00] positions and he has given us power over
[1:10:04] the devils now there actually is a
[1:10:05] couple Commission's on the church
[1:10:06] there's the first Commission and then
[1:10:08] the last Commission is that right and
[1:10:10] both of them Commission's had to church
[1:10:12] with power over the devil amen so one
[1:10:15] thing we got to be sure of this morning
[1:10:17] that we don't let someone take that
[1:10:18] scripture and turn it around to mean
[1:10:20] that the church wouldn't have power over
[1:10:22] the devil of course we have power over
[1:10:25] the devil the very the very origin of
[1:10:28] your life the very thing that you were
[1:10:31] created for was actually to bruise the
[1:10:33] head of the serpent that's that's in the
[1:10:35] scripture for the woman seed should brew
[1:10:37] the head of the serpent and that woman
[1:10:38] seed turned out to be Abraham seed and
[1:10:41] the scripture says that you that are
[1:10:43] dead in Christ are Abraham's seed and
[1:10:46] heir according to the promises then
[1:10:48] every devil is actually subject under
[1:10:50] the Church of the Living God amen and
[1:10:52] I'll tell you it's a powerful thing when
[1:10:54] you start recognizing your authority
[1:10:56] over the enemy and over the devil amen
[1:10:59] but Jesus is saying that there's a
[1:11:01] there's a level here amen that is a
[1:11:03] little higher in understanding and he's
[1:11:06] telling you that that's where your real
[1:11:08] rejoicing are to be him because of
[1:11:10] course even the Antichrist spirits was
[1:11:12] going to manifest
[1:11:14] portions of the word and and and they
[1:11:16] was actually a Judas was here right in
[1:11:18] the ministry at this time casting out
[1:11:20] Devils amen but but but Jesus is letting
[1:11:23] them know that there is a separation
[1:11:25] here and there are some of these names
[1:11:27] that are actually written in heaven and
[1:11:29] men that are written in a portion of
[1:11:31] this room we'll just pick the way the
[1:11:32] prophet takes it in the Lamb's Book of
[1:11:34] Life now there's one thing that's for
[1:11:36] sure is that everything is actually
[1:11:38] pre-planned by God do you know that
[1:11:42] there was a time that you actually knew
[1:11:43] these things but brother M says you're
[1:11:45] darkened to it now he said there's only
[1:11:47] been one man on the earth that actually
[1:11:50] knew what happened before that's right
[1:11:53] he said father glorify me with the glory
[1:11:55] I had before you before the foundation
[1:11:57] of the world he was the Incarnate God
[1:11:58] and he could move back there and know
[1:12:01] what it is but our minds are blackened
[1:12:03] to that in other words we can't remember
[1:12:05] but we don't have any knowledge of what
[1:12:07] it was before creation or back before I
[1:12:10] burst but Jesus did have knowledge of
[1:12:12] what it was before the world ever even
[1:12:15] began amen you know the prophet of God
[1:12:17] says that we're actually ordained and
[1:12:19] predestinated and predestinated means
[1:12:22] the destination of anything that was pre
[1:12:25] saw by God he says now that's not still
[1:12:28] milk
[1:12:28] hey man that's not skim milk anything
[1:12:31] that is pre solved by God has
[1:12:33] predestinated or ordained he says now if
[1:12:36] we go over and in the book of Ephesians
[1:12:37] in the first chapter he said I'm afraid
[1:12:40] that we're missing it they said that you
[1:12:43] maybe you think that I'm just saying
[1:12:44] this but I want you to listen closely
[1:12:45] and we'll get down to the church in a
[1:12:47] few minutes Paul is actually addressing
[1:12:50] in Ephesians 1 directly to the shoulder
[1:12:52] of the church and that's what we're
[1:12:54] doing tonight for this is not for babies
[1:12:56] this is for grown-ups this is not for
[1:12:59] babies and fission chapter 1 and verse 4
[1:13:01] said according as he has chosen us in
[1:13:04] him before the foundation of the world
[1:13:06] that we should be holy and without blame
[1:13:09] before him in love you say in love now
[1:13:14] according to the Bible it says we're in
[1:13:17] that loved us segment marina style of
[1:13:20] this been in the book of Romans Paul
[1:13:21] answers in Romans chapter 9 for Jacob
[1:13:23] have I loved and Esau have I hated and
[1:13:27] both of illness before they were ever
[1:13:28] even born but God by his foreknowledge
[1:13:31] understood the nature's of them to
[1:13:34] children and told us before they were
[1:13:36] born one I love and the other I hate but
[1:13:38] the man says in the message of hearing
[1:13:41] acting recognizing he actually says that
[1:13:43] this is a picture it meant of the end
[1:13:46] time and of two groups in the end time
[1:13:48] of the carnal pigment and the spiritual
[1:13:50] churches and before they ever come into
[1:13:53] existence God already wrote that he's
[1:13:55] going to love one and he's going to hate
[1:13:57] the other just like he knew he would
[1:13:59] love Jacob in Haiti so he knew he would
[1:14:01] love the spiritual and he would hate the
[1:14:04] carnal he meant God could actually for
[1:14:06] know this and see it having
[1:14:08] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:14:11] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:14:12] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:14:15] will he meant in that beautiful having
[1:14:17] predestinated us unto a place of an
[1:14:20] option Amen go back to Ephesians 1 in 4
[1:14:23] according as he has chosen us in him he
[1:14:28] now according as he who is that he
[1:14:30] that's God chose us in him before the
[1:14:35] foundation of the world that we should
[1:14:37] be holy and without blame before him in
[1:14:39] love having done this before the
[1:14:41] foundation amendment I think that's a
[1:14:44] key point this morning having done this
[1:14:46] before
[1:14:47] and meant before the earth was created
[1:14:50] having done this before the angels are
[1:14:54] created he done this before anything was
[1:14:58] ever created so before the devil was in
[1:15:01] existence God already has
[1:15:05] and chose a men that would be greater
[1:15:07] than the devil before the devil ever got
[1:15:10] there to think before the devil before
[1:15:13] the earth before sin before time before
[1:15:16] that would see anything God already
[1:15:18] chose this before it can ever happen you
[1:15:22] saw but by the way you don't know what's
[1:15:23] happening but I know before that
[1:15:25] happened that God already made a choice
[1:15:28] you said when this happened and that
[1:15:30] happen in this situation but enough
[1:15:32] before that situation that before that
[1:15:34] and before the altar that before the
[1:15:37] devil before there was a star before
[1:15:39] there was a earth before that was an
[1:15:42] angel before there was any faint god he
[1:15:45] meant close us in him before the
[1:15:47] foundation of the world that means to
[1:15:50] tell me that barring the devil there
[1:15:52] ain't no circumstance there ain't no
[1:15:55] situation there's nothing I'm doing what
[1:16:01] God in eternity God is already having
[1:16:04] sewed up before you ever got here God
[1:16:07] already decided that you were gonna be
[1:16:10] in victory this morning no devil can do
[1:16:14] anything about it because before before
[1:16:20] now that's a powerful thing to me amen
[1:16:24] before Amen I tell you this a man before
[1:16:27] amen you see a man that this actually
[1:16:31] brings something beautiful
[1:16:32] Amen according to the Lamb's Book of
[1:16:34] Life brother BAM says this he said a
[1:16:37] believer he said have you got your joy
[1:16:40] shoes on these are my joy shoes
[1:16:46] have you got you toys shoes on sister
[1:16:50] joy you got your shoes on
[1:16:52] you got some joy shoes on amen you know
[1:16:56] what I think I've been watching some
[1:16:57] people with their joy shoes I've been
[1:16:59] seeing some people this weekend with her
[1:17:01] choice shoes huh I saw people cutting up
[1:17:03] and running and dancing inside and
[1:17:06] rejoicing amen they were wearing their
[1:17:08] joy shoes listen if you're a Christian
[1:17:10] you are truly a God's child then the
[1:17:13] Bible says now that's not a preacher of
[1:17:15] the Bible said he said your names were
[1:17:17] actually written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:17:19] Life from before the foundation of the
[1:17:22] world the same time that Christ that God
[1:17:25] sent Christ to be slain he wrote your
[1:17:27] name with his there you are your name is
[1:17:31] actually written all he deceived all
[1:17:33] great and small church members pretended
[1:17:36] Christians he deceived the whole whose
[1:17:38] names were not written
[1:17:39] he said now not in the church book or in
[1:17:42] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:17:44] foundation of the world God wrote your
[1:17:46] name in the Lamb's Book of Life amen
[1:17:49] bleh the spoken word now imagine this
[1:17:52] have you got your joy shoes on because
[1:17:54] brother man's going to tell you
[1:17:56] something amen that is actually ain't
[1:17:59] meant been given to the church for a
[1:18:01] sake of rejoicing he's saying that if
[1:18:04] you want to if you really want to
[1:18:06] rejoice now here it's a place you can
[1:18:08] rejoice Amen that God put your name on
[1:18:11] the Lamb's Book of Life from before the
[1:18:13] foundation of the world and he did it by
[1:18:16] the spoken word I always wondered how'd
[1:18:19] he write our name on the book there
[1:18:21] before there was books before there was
[1:18:22] anything how did he do it up there but
[1:18:25] the prophet of God told us how it
[1:18:27] happened he said he wrote it by the
[1:18:29] spoken word Amen can you imagine that
[1:18:32] God actually spoke your name before the
[1:18:36] found a
[1:18:36] the work that God has spoke your name
[1:18:39] before that was anything God knew that
[1:18:42] was going to be a believer in this thing
[1:18:44] God me that would be an overcomer in
[1:18:46] this thing and he actually spoke your
[1:18:49] name to think that that name was
[1:18:51] actually spoken before the world ever
[1:18:53] began that God before Adam and Eve was
[1:18:56] in the Garden of Eden he spoke that
[1:18:58] night
[1:18:58] then when Eve was actually falling in
[1:19:01] the Garden of Eden as the first Eve God
[1:19:04] already knew that he had a second Eve
[1:19:07] who was going to not fall but she was
[1:19:10] going to stand now the puppet of God
[1:19:13] said do you see that first he fail she
[1:19:16] failed because she failed from the word
[1:19:18] he said but did you see the second II
[1:19:20] she can not fall because this one will
[1:19:24] be the word do you see we're not falling
[1:19:27] from the word because we're actually the
[1:19:30] word that was spoken before the world's
[1:19:33] ever even began do you see that word he
[1:19:36] cannot return unto the Lord Boyd for
[1:19:39] whatever God has spoken it shall
[1:19:41] accomplish that one it is set out to do
[1:19:43] what God speaks a word it will be
[1:19:45] fulfilled that's God has already spoken
[1:19:48] it then you're a part of the word now I
[1:19:50] don't know about you but sometimes I
[1:19:52] read the scripture in Revelation 13 and
[1:19:54] revelation 17 and I read about the Beast
[1:19:57] and and I read how he deceived the whole
[1:19:59] world and how that heel heel caused all
[1:20:02] these troubles and the scripture said
[1:20:03] that everything upon the earth shall
[1:20:05] worship the image of the Beast except
[1:20:08] those whose names are not written I
[1:20:10] think I think it's amazing that in the
[1:20:13] middle of revelation 13 in the middle of
[1:20:15] revelation 17 when God is describing the
[1:20:18] revelation of the beast and his
[1:20:19] deception that it just in case as a
[1:20:22] believer reading that scripture see what
[1:20:25] happens when you start reading about all
[1:20:27] that deception you start reading about
[1:20:28] all of that the devil starts putting it
[1:20:31] in the minds of the people well maybe
[1:20:32] that you're going to
[1:20:33] that maybe you're gonna be caught now
[1:20:35] how do you know but right in the middle
[1:20:37] that there's a little space in there
[1:20:39] that says except those whose names are
[1:20:41] written in the Lamb's Book of Life soul
[1:20:43] just in case a part of that bride is
[1:20:46] reading the Bible about deception God
[1:20:48] let John put a little something there
[1:20:50] and said that don't forget now I want
[1:20:53] you to remember I have not forgotten
[1:20:55] that I have spoken a name and they will
[1:20:59] not be deceived in the hour of deception
[1:21:02] but they're going to stand Amen
[1:21:04] according to the Bible that false Christ
[1:21:06] shall rise the boy we've seen that Henry
[1:21:12] basquiat shall arise make man false
[1:21:15] prophets shall show great signs and so
[1:21:17] much if it were possible they would
[1:21:18] deceive the very elect brother and said
[1:21:21] that word elect comes from election they
[1:21:25] meant then that would be a deception if
[1:21:27] there wasn't an election but because
[1:21:30] there has been an election God isn't
[1:21:32] elected amen then God will not allow
[1:21:35] Satan to touch that life with deception
[1:21:39] do you know that's a people on this
[1:21:41] earth right now who cannot be deceived I
[1:21:45] know I thought sometimes fear wants to
[1:21:48] grip your mind and the Saints as well
[1:21:50] and this is going to happen and this is
[1:21:52] going to happen but you've got to
[1:21:53] recognize hate men that God has already
[1:21:55] spoke something concerning ain't bride
[1:21:58] in the last days but in the time of
[1:22:01] deception she can not be deceived
[1:22:05] because she's been elected to not be
[1:22:08] deceived but to standing
[1:22:10] that they sent my to think that he spoke
[1:22:13] your name mother and said see he spoke
[1:22:15] your name he meant now in perfection
[1:22:18] mother man said not only Christ was
[1:22:19] slain to take away sin but your name was
[1:22:22] written in the Lamb's Book of Life from
[1:22:24] before the foundation of the world that
[1:22:27] God wrote your name associated with
[1:22:29] years before the foundation of the world
[1:22:30] now Satan make them get scared now get
[1:22:34] them to doubt that in that something
[1:22:37] make them scared out so a prophet is
[1:22:39] teaching us something that will take all
[1:22:42] of the feeder out of the church he's
[1:22:45] teaching us something that will take all
[1:22:47] the fear out of your life do you see if
[1:22:50] you put things based on your abilities
[1:22:52] based on what you can think and what you
[1:22:54] can do and what you can say then saying
[1:22:57] will always keep you under the fear that
[1:22:59] maybe you didn't do enough maybe you
[1:23:01] didn't say enough maybe you wasn't just
[1:23:03] able to do that hate men but with you
[1:23:06] moving off of you and you put it on to
[1:23:08] God then God has given us more than
[1:23:11] enough to conquer every devil every
[1:23:14] power the blood was more than enough to
[1:23:17] take ever sin and his word is
[1:23:19] enough to defeat every devil it's
[1:23:22] alright the Word of God would defeat
[1:23:24] Satan anywhere any place any time in any
[1:23:30] form so you can only see when you start
[1:23:33] recognizing that you are the Word of God
[1:23:36] then the Bride of Christ would defeat
[1:23:38] Satan anywhere any place any time under
[1:23:43] any condition because she's already been
[1:23:46] written in heaven as the victorious
[1:23:48] church now Satan make them get scared
[1:23:54] make them that bat for them before the
[1:23:57] world ever began God called your name
[1:24:00] you were Christians and wrote in the
[1:24:02] Lamb's Book of Life before the world
[1:24:03] ever started
[1:24:04] that's God's Word he spoke it back there
[1:24:07] and revealed it through his servants now
[1:24:10] what is you soul brother Wayne what's
[1:24:12] actually going on now but the RAM says
[1:24:14] it like this then your name was put in
[1:24:15] the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:24:16] God spoke the word it was in his
[1:24:18] thinking and in his thought he spoke the
[1:24:23] word and everything happened at that
[1:24:26] time this is just God's seed
[1:24:30] materializing and then this is his seed
[1:24:35] materializing his word is coming down
[1:24:38] the line of God is flashing across
[1:24:40] quickly and the cedar recognizes it
[1:24:43] because it's born of God it's Abraham's
[1:24:45] seed is four-note by God that's why the
[1:24:48] light flashes it's to catch the sea do
[1:24:53] you see that he actually now is
[1:24:55] materializing something that he saw
[1:24:58] before the world's ever began amen to
[1:25:01] think of this that God ordains you and
[1:25:02] called you before the foundation of the
[1:25:04] world see but it never happened until
[1:25:07] 4000 years later that's right you see
[1:25:11] then this is where Joel here's the
[1:25:13] question in job 38 hey man he's asked
[1:25:16] my god job where were you before the
[1:25:20] foundations of the world amen 11:00
[1:25:23] don't you amen and when the sons of God
[1:25:25] shouted for joy amen I don't think
[1:25:29] there's a mistake in the scripture I
[1:25:30] don't think it said Sun some accident I
[1:25:33] don't think that it meant to say service
[1:25:36] and accidentally sent sons but it said
[1:25:38] where were you with the sons of God was
[1:25:42] shouting for joy I tell you this not
[1:25:44] just a servant anymore but there's
[1:25:46] somebody coming to sonship and God
[1:25:49] already solid before the world ever
[1:25:51] began the prophet of God said what was
[1:25:54] they shouting about he said they were
[1:25:55] shouting because they realized that lamb
[1:25:58] had been being slain for them and they
[1:26:01] were coming to perfection back there in
[1:26:03] the mind of God do you see a menu
[1:26:05] already shouting in the mind of God
[1:26:08] that's why we're shouting here because
[1:26:11] we're shouting there we're only doing
[1:26:13] now what God saw back man he's just
[1:26:16] materialized him the mind of God amen
[1:26:19] he's solid
[1:26:20] breakdown he saw the revelation strike
[1:26:23] your life and there you shouted amen it
[1:26:26] asked you where were you before the
[1:26:28] foundation of the world well I tell you
[1:26:30] something tonight
[1:26:31] I read this morning I believe we had to
[1:26:34] answer I believe we have to tension we
[1:26:39] were fed we were in the mind of God amen
[1:26:42] until the seventh angel come we did not
[1:26:45] have that answer but tonight but this
[1:26:48] morning by the grace of God were able to
[1:26:50] know the answer that was here from job
[1:26:53] was hid from the prophets but has been
[1:26:56] revealed to you that before there was
[1:26:59] anything God already had a church I was
[1:27:02] gonna tell
[1:27:03] the Saints and he was going to take over
[1:27:05] because their names were written on the

[1:32:57] anointing but there's an anointing on
[1:32:59] every son and daughter of God that's an
[1:33:02] anointing there because you're on the
[1:33:04] list of God we are not be seen by this
[1:33:10] intellectual spirit that says you got to
[1:33:12] shut up and sit down and take whatever

[1:33:17] everything or overcomers of this lab to

[1:33:29] the list but everybody
[1:33:31] has got a power over the devil every
[1:33:36] devil is subject ever powder subject
[1:33:39] ain't no but it's not just any subject
[1:33:42] yes he can't get away from you miss said
[1:33:52] preacher Amen are you sure about this
[1:33:54] there's only one that had pre creation
[1:33:56] knowledge and that was the one that met
[1:33:58] Abraham told him what his name was told
[1:34:02] him what his promises was and his name
[1:34:05] was Melchizedek he knew his name didn't
[1:34:08] he Abraham Melchizedek knew its name do
[1:34:11] y'all know the Bible said in Matthew the
[1:34:13] first chapter that Jesus was both the
[1:34:15] son of David and the son of Abraham and
[1:34:18] it was the only two men in the Bible
[1:34:20] that spoken of Qasr dick was both
[1:34:22] Abraham and David and he was attributed
[1:34:25] to be the son of both of him that's why
[1:34:27] amen that brother Ram Sedna Cassidy
[1:34:29] became Jesus Christ who is the son of
[1:34:32] David who is the son of Abraham and then
[1:34:34] he is Melchizedek amen he is the word he
[1:34:38] is the all-knowing God and Jesus stood
[1:34:40] in John 17 and said I had acknowledged
[1:34:43] before the world ever began and he
[1:34:45] actually included his disciples in his
[1:34:48] free creation knowledge and let them
[1:34:50] know that God gave me you before the
[1:34:53] world ever began and was so powerful
[1:34:56] that he challenged the devil and said
[1:34:58] that the devil Peter wants to sift you
[1:35:01] as sand but don't you worry I've already
[1:35:03] pray for you and that's a powerful point
[1:35:08] in my heart that God's already prayed
[1:35:10] but they will desire to deceive you but
[1:35:13] don't worry I already played for you now
[1:35:16] Lord when did you pray for me before the
[1:35:18] foundation of the world
[1:35:20] he spoke your name in victory now the
[1:35:24] prophet of God said see this is where
[1:35:26] the book of life comes into view is used
[1:35:28] to smoke a sermon because that same
[1:35:30] Jesus Christ amen returns in the form of
[1:35:33] the Holy Ghost in the last days and
[1:35:35] actually
[1:35:36] visits this generation in a name-calling
[1:35:39] but the bride of Jesus Christ who has
[1:35:42] their remains on that lands book of life
[1:35:44] see Jesus had that pre creation
[1:35:46] knowledge y'all recognize that we have
[1:35:48] Branham didn't even have one a seventh
[1:35:50] grade education and he's telling you
[1:35:54] what happened before the world ever
[1:35:55] began he's telling you about your names
[1:35:57] and how that was written he was said
[1:35:59] Amen a man without a seventh grade
[1:36:01] education said come and go with me and
[1:36:04] let's stand on the banisters of time
[1:36:06] right into eternity and said see what it
[1:36:08] was there was nothing there wasn't even
[1:36:10] a god he said he was hello healed
[1:36:13] self-existent one he said that because
[1:36:15] there was nothing to rejoice or nothing
[1:36:17] to worship he said he wasn't even God at
[1:36:20] that time he said it was a great all of
[1:36:22] a sudden he said a great fountain of a
[1:36:24] rainbow began to spew up out of eternity
[1:36:26] he said then that rainbow was formed to
[1:36:29] a theophany and how did that feed off
[1:36:31] and he beginning to create and he said
[1:36:33] that was the earth and the Sun the moons
[1:36:35] you see what he's doing he's taking you
[1:36:37] back I'm telling you before the earth
[1:36:39] before the Sun before all these things
[1:36:41] there you were all the way back there in
[1:36:44] that great rainbow back there God
[1:36:47] favored you back there that's why he
[1:36:50] favors you up here do you imagine that
[1:36:55] great pre creation knowledge coming to
[1:36:57] us hey man and the theologians saying
[1:37:01] this one way and the doctors say it's
[1:37:02] another way and here's a little prophet
[1:37:04] saying this is the way it happened your
[1:37:07] schools tried to teach you that you come
[1:37:10] from an ape or you're from some Big Bang
[1:37:12] or you come from some situation and I'm
[1:37:15] always wondering how they know so much
[1:37:19] because none of them was there
[1:37:24] just to be honest I never was there just
[1:37:28] like a guy told me here while back he
[1:37:29] said well Alain brother branham missed
[1:37:30] it on that that boy being raised from
[1:37:32] dead over in Finland he told me how
[1:37:34] brother battle didn't have all that
[1:37:35] right and all that man was maybe in his
[1:37:37] mid-50s I don't know after he told me
[1:37:39] about that a while look right at him I
[1:37:41] said well hey man well how did he go
[1:37:43] then he said what do you mean I said
[1:37:46] well of course you must have been there
[1:37:47] and have all this obvious of what
[1:37:48] happened he said well you know I wasn't
[1:37:51] there I said well then pound the
[1:37:52] tarnation do you know what happened now
[1:37:56] the hillbilly if you wasn't there
[1:37:57] you probably don't know what happened
[1:37:59] but why don't you hear the guy that was
[1:38:02] there they meant william branham wasn't
[1:38:04] there but Jesus Christ was there and
[1:38:07] fact Jesus is a spirit that took over a
[1:38:10] man's body and pronounced in this age
[1:38:12] but that was a pride back there before
[1:38:15] the world ever began and he's coming to
[1:38:17] this age you see what brother Ram did he
[1:38:20] said well that that cameras Hornsby 42
[1:38:23] inches he said he said that they'll be a
[1:38:25] grizzly bear they'll be a boy in a green
[1:38:27] check her church he said oh and then the
[1:38:29] place he said will cost couple screams
[1:38:31] want to be mighty want to be clear who
[1:38:33] catch fish the first two days won't
[1:38:35] catch the Lord then we'll catch this
[1:38:36] little bit now you say why would he do
[1:38:38] that why would he do that to let you
[1:38:40] know but he knew what he was talking
[1:38:42] about he was telling them things that
[1:38:47] happened before because he was showing
[1:38:49] them that the same God that's telling
[1:38:51] you about these fish and he's counting
[1:38:53] these bear is the same God that's
[1:38:55] telling me what was going on back back
[1:38:57] before the foundations of the world that
[1:39:00] there actually was a people there now do
[1:39:04] you see God actually ordained some unto
[1:39:07] eternal life amen to Biotest that he
[1:39:10] actually prayed he actually prayed for
[1:39:13] Peter that he would not a man be sitting
[1:39:16] as saying of course we know a man that
[1:39:18] Peter did fail greatly amen but the
[1:39:23] failure of Peters life did not become
[1:39:25] the identification of Peters life
[1:39:27] after Peter fell the Lord three times he
[1:39:31] actually became the spokesman of the day
[1:39:33] of Pentecost and is reported to opening
[1:39:36] the door in acts the second chapter to
[1:39:39] the by baptism of the Holy Ghost the man
[1:39:41] that had that lets failure became a man
[1:39:44] who was key in the scripture that
[1:39:46] carried the keys of the kingdom of God
[1:39:48] binding and loosing amen that was a
[1:39:51] reason why because God knew the devil
[1:39:53] was going to throw everything he had at
[1:39:55] Peter he knew because of Peters position
[1:39:58] in the church
[1:39:59] everything the devil honey was going to
[1:40:01] throw at Peter remember that God also me
[1:40:04] that before Peter failed before Peter
[1:40:07] had problems he knew that God already
[1:40:09] ordained him before the world to begin
[1:40:12] to stand where he was going to stand
[1:40:15] admit that wasn't enough Devils you
[1:40:18] think about this it meant sometimes you
[1:40:20] look around you see the devil folks
[1:40:21] everything he's got I know this for sure
[1:40:23] brother Tim devil throw everything he's
[1:40:25] got into church he's through everything
[1:40:27] he's gotta chew through everything he's
[1:40:29] got to chew he's through everything he
[1:40:31] got him have you ever been through
[1:40:33] anything the devil folks everything he's
[1:40:35] got at you don't meet anybody wasn't
[1:40:39] there now see whatever the devil through
[1:40:42] that she wasn't enough and if it was
[1:40:44] everything that he had then it tells me
[1:40:47] the devil just don't have enough the
[1:40:50] devil didn't have a
[1:40:51] enough to keep Peter from being the
[1:40:53] spokesman on the day of Pentecost amen
[1:40:56] that makes me believe that the devil
[1:40:58] don't have enough to keep this bride
[1:41:02] from standing in her position in the
[1:41:05] last days buried enough Devils in hell
[1:41:11] to keep this pot out of her adoption
[1:41:14] fair enough powers give the hell but
[1:41:17] keep this church from fulfilling what
[1:41:19] God and state were doing this last
[1:41:22] things no sir not enough tell somebody
[1:41:26] there ain't enough no sir you know what
[1:41:29] before the world began where were you
[1:41:31] the sons of God that was shouting for
[1:41:33] joy
[1:41:33] that doesn't say servants that doesn't
[1:41:36] say angels because you know what we've
[1:41:38] had a prophet among us who said you were
[1:41:40] never an angel you were never an angel
[1:41:44] and you will never be an angel but you
[1:41:47] always were a son and that's why you are
[1:41:50] a son then you've got to quit thinking
[1:41:52] then adoption means you're an angel
[1:41:55] amen that you're an angel an angel an
[1:41:57] angel you see how the devil is trying to
[1:42:00] twist up the idea of the Church of the
[1:42:02] Living God to put this way out on the
[1:42:04] future somewhere but this is not a
[1:42:07] future event this is a part of the Bride
[1:42:10] of Christ in the last days my often say
[1:42:17] it like this devil got everybody in his
[1:42:19] place nobody's arguing that are their
[1:42:23] Sodom's in their place homosexuals are
[1:42:27] in their place denomination is in their
[1:42:29] place and the devil's got power to put
[1:42:31] all of them in their place then you're
[1:42:33] telling me God don't have the power to
[1:42:37] put this bride in the place she belongs
[1:42:39] in
[1:42:39] not one I tell you as a bunch of people
[1:42:42] gotta hold this message and twist it
[1:42:44] enough to put adoption somewheres out in
[1:42:46] the future when God give it with the
[1:42:48] Holy Ghost to bring the church in
[1:42:50] authority
[1:42:51] come on Church that take us back to the
[1:42:53] mind of God before the world began I'm
[1:42:56] not trying to get into doctrine I'm
[1:42:57] trying to get into a place to say the
[1:42:59] devil has tried to put this away from
[1:43:02] you and God has brought it to you but
[1:43:05] say there ain't enough Devils to keep
[1:43:07] the church
[1:43:12] no sir not enough I'll tell you this the
[1:43:16] scripture said for we know that all
[1:43:17] things work together for the good of
[1:43:20] them that love God to them that are
[1:43:21] called
[1:43:22] that says they called according to his
[1:43:25] purpose for whom he did foreknow he also
[1:43:27] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:43:29] image of his son that he might be the
[1:43:30] firstborn among many brethren for
[1:43:34] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[1:43:36] he also called and whom he called been
[1:43:40] he also justified and whom he justified
[1:43:43] them he also glorified that's right amen
[1:43:48] then for the children not yet being born
[1:43:50] neither having done any good or evil
[1:43:52] that the purpose of God according to the
[1:43:56] election might stand not of works but of
[1:44:01] him that calleth before I formed thee in
[1:44:06] the belly Jeremiah said even before I
[1:44:11] formed thee in the belly I knew thee
[1:44:14] before thou camest forth out of the womb
[1:44:17] I sanctified thee and I ordained me to
[1:44:21] be a prophet of the nations before he
[1:44:23] was ever even born can you imagine that
[1:44:27] everything God does is pre-planned now I
[1:44:32] think it's amazing when you start
[1:44:34] talking about the pre plans of God
[1:44:35] because I'm I'm gonna forgetful fella I
[1:44:38] used to not be so much but it's getting
[1:44:40] worse all the time I forget things
[1:44:42] there's probably people mad at me right
[1:44:44] now but I don't
[1:44:44] why it's the truth
[1:44:52] I've had people if anybody's watching
[1:44:54] here in you're upset at me forgive me
[1:44:56] okay I forgot I have you know sometimes
[1:45:02] do you see God actually pre plans but
[1:45:06] knowledge now his knowledge it's an
[1:45:09] infant no jar knowledge is a finite
[1:45:10] knowledge okay to find that knowledge
[1:45:13] but even in finite knowledge there is
[1:45:16] pre-planning you think about the
[1:45:18] knowledge of a man wants to build a
[1:45:20] house he builds it for certain size he
[1:45:22] now we got Planning Commission's and
[1:45:24] they think about the things we don't
[1:45:25] think about you know the road and CERN
[1:45:27] they think it's a pre-planning it's a
[1:45:30] it's an infinite mind amen in God but in
[1:45:33] man it's a finite mind but look at how
[1:45:35] far they're moving towards planning
[1:45:36] knowing that it makes a difference to
[1:45:39] plan before something happens see before
[1:45:42] the rain comes let's get the right
[1:45:43] culvert before the problem let's get the
[1:45:45] right amount of sewage before you get
[1:45:47] get everything planned out good because
[1:45:49] it's a pre plan of God now now I just
[1:45:51] took a little a little maybe a little
[1:45:53] example today to prove that there is
[1:45:55] pre-planning now to be honest with you I
[1:45:57] pre planned the meeting in the back room
[1:46:00] I was sitting there thinking about this
[1:46:01] and I thought I thought isn't it amazing
[1:46:03] that man can do this if man can do it
[1:46:05] why can't God do it you think about a
[1:46:08] brother brother Luke Pruett will yet
[1:46:11] with Luke he just walked out of the room
[1:46:15] he's just up top can you come here
[1:46:17] minion brother Luke I don't know brother
[1:46:24] Tim could you had something maybe you
[1:46:26] could just come right with him brother
[1:46:30] look you see there's a there's a there's
[1:46:32] actually a way to pre-plan something in
[1:46:35] a fine mind but there's like I just
[1:46:39] called Luke Pruitt by name I just called
[1:46:41] Tim winters by name but the only reason
[1:46:43] I could do that's because I knew them
[1:46:44] before this so if I didn't know him
[1:46:47] before the sermon I could never say to
[1:46:49] them look her to improve our team
[1:46:51] winners I couldn't call their name
[1:46:53] because I would have no knowledge of
[1:46:55] them now another thing I had to know is
[1:46:57] if I call them they'd actually come
[1:47:01] because there's something huge that
[1:47:03] don't know now the other thing is I knew
[1:47:09] they'd had to come and another thing I
[1:47:10] knew is I knew they'd have to know I'm
[1:47:12] wasn't bringing them up here to
[1:47:13] embarrass some say got your name on
[1:47:16] forget your name on a man god bless you
[1:47:19] you see they would have to know the
[1:47:22] reason I brought him there was for a
[1:47:24] purpose other than to embarrass them or
[1:47:26] to hurt them but they were answering a
[1:47:28] call because I asked them by name and
[1:47:30] they knew my nature in my calling he's
[1:47:33] not gonna shoot this he's nothing part
[1:47:35] us he's not what embarrasses he must
[1:47:37] have something in mind it's gonna be a
[1:47:38] blessing to our lives or he never would
[1:47:40] cause but because of their knowledge of
[1:47:42] me and my knowledge of them they came
[1:47:44] into the call and now they're an example
[1:47:49] to the rest of the combination of my
[1:47:52] knowledge of him there's somebody in the
[1:47:55] spirit against them do I know them of
[1:47:57] course I know him you saw me call them
[1:47:59] my name amen and God has called you and
[1:48:03] made you an example of his full
[1:48:06] knowledge of before the world began that
[1:48:07] he put you on your god bless you then he
[1:48:09] put you on the list
[1:48:11] amen and then he in this age would call
[1:48:13] your name because he's proving by that
[1:48:16] calling that he actually knew you before
[1:48:18] him is that right hey man there's one
[1:48:23] more I want to call here hey sister I
[1:48:25] was thinking can you come hey man I tell
[1:48:27] you what this lady right here puts in
[1:48:29] enough prayer amen she prays for me
[1:48:32] all the times you know you can feel
[1:48:33] people's prayers if y'all know that amen
[1:48:36] and this lady god bless her sister
[1:48:38] Barbara
[1:48:38] Amen how many loves sister Barbara
[1:48:44] god bless you see this couldn't happen
[1:48:47] if we didn't know one another they meant
[1:48:50] you didn't know I was gonna do this did
[1:48:51] you ain't meant but you know now cuz I
[1:48:54] brought you in when I called you he
[1:48:56] meant now she's an example that I didn't
[1:48:58] normally just call what I didn't just
[1:49:00] call too but I could call three male or
[1:49:02] female and make an example of something
[1:49:05] I wanted to you all to see god bless you
[1:49:08] says amen there's a scripture in there
[1:49:10] for you do you see God actually plans
[1:49:12] things and writes them out and then at a
[1:49:15] certain time he will actually show a
[1:49:18] favor to a certain name by the calling
[1:49:21] of that name now God in this age has
[1:49:24] actually favored the Church of the
[1:49:26] Living God and meant to call you by name
[1:49:30] and to bring you in a great plan plan of
[1:49:33] God and in this plan you're not
[1:49:36] destroyed in this plan you are not in
[1:49:38] Paris in this plan you're not you're not
[1:49:41] defeated you're not lukewarm amen but
[1:49:44] jesus said you should be rejoicing in
[1:49:48] the plan of God when you heard your name
[1:49:51] you would rejoice knowing that God
[1:49:54] called you by name I'll tell you
[1:49:58] something today I believe this is the
[1:49:59] hour of the favor of God upon the church
[1:50:02] and I believe this is me and you can
[1:50:05] rejoice I believe this is the time I
[1:50:09] believe this is the hour where God is
[1:50:11] let the church feel what it is to be
[1:50:13] called therefore we are pre-planned of
[1:50:19] God it's all pre plan but gene of God
[1:50:21] you see there's only one form of eternal
[1:50:23] life and that's God's life only one form
[1:50:26] and that's God then that was there to be
[1:50:28] a son of God you had to always be in him
[1:50:31] a gene of his life you saw brother Wayne
[1:50:34] I don't remember it does that matter
[1:50:35] does that mean you're not there if you
[1:50:37] don't remember it you got to be careful
[1:50:40] because hey man I don't remember my mama
[1:50:42] hey man what day I was born in the howl
[1:50:44] of the day and I don't remember what the
[1:50:46] weather was like I don't even remember
[1:50:48] getting my first diaper changed or my
[1:50:49] bottles I don't
[1:50:52] but my mother does my mother can tell
[1:50:55] you the whole story because she was
[1:50:57] actually there amen and when I begin to
[1:50:59] get a little older she begin to tell me
[1:51:02] stories about things that happen to me
[1:51:03] when I was a child and she began to
[1:51:05] bring me in her understanding of what I
[1:51:08] was when I don't even remember and God
[1:51:11] before you remember before you do
[1:51:13] anything about it you were already in
[1:51:16] him but this word is actually bringing
[1:51:19] out the manifestation of what you were
[1:51:22] in God before the world began come on
[1:51:25] you saw brother Wayne did you exist
[1:51:27] before you were born sure I existed
[1:51:29] before I was born
[1:51:30] you say how did you exist that's my
[1:51:32] father come on
[1:51:36] there was a little boy run around with
[1:51:38] my dad I was in him I was in my father
[1:51:42] until I was expressed in this age and I
[1:51:45] was in God until I was expressed in this
[1:51:48] age but this expression has come come on
[1:51:51] amen if you take a grain of corn and you
[1:51:54] bring forth the seat from that what is
[1:51:56] it if you bring a cat and it has a cat
[1:52:00] it has a baby what is it if you have a
[1:52:03] dog and it has a baby what is it

[1:52:09] child
[1:52:10] but child as a child of the Most High
[1:52:14] God with the very attributes but
[1:52:18] Almighty God is still the church right
[1:52:21] now supreme power supreme authority
[1:52:25] there ain't no damage no power very
[1:52:28] nothing that can revoke that child you
[1:52:30] see my name what's on the Lamb's Book of
[1:52:34] Life
[1:52:34] I was a part of you before before you
[1:52:41] said are you sure
[1:52:42] brother Branham said Amen that when you
[1:52:44] heard this message when you heard this
[1:52:48] message you recognized it as legal food
[1:52:52] he said say you heard from your
[1:52:54] theophany before you were ever left the
[1:52:58] eagle's nest that little baby eagle

[1:54:30] chickens hey the Eagle come back and the
[1:54:36] Eagle tongue bath epic in the fowl of
[1:54:39] Japan
[1:54:45] can you hear it
[1:54:46] can you hear it Japan the eagle is
[1:54:50] calling you you'll see often he is
[1:54:53] calling you
[1:55:03] Oh Lolita god that's right the Sun is up
[1:55:11] the Sun of righteousness has arisen the
[1:55:15] eagle is flew out brother he wasn't a
[1:55:19] son but they you heard that eagle you
[1:55:21] wasn't a son these preachers come over
[1:55:23] there and started preaching they didn't
[1:55:24] make you a son you was already an eagle
[1:55:27] he was already a son this message only
[1:55:30] told you you don't have to live in that
[1:55:33] chicken barn you don't have to live
[1:55:35] under traditions and ideas of and spread
[1:55:38] your wings eagle you can fly you can fly
[1:55:42] higher than any other bird well I feel
[1:55:47] that wind can I feel that wind coming
[1:55:50] again home the day of Pentecost there
[1:55:53] was a rushing wind
[1:55:56] and when they come out of the upper room
[1:56:13] the revelation had struck them the
[1:56:16] revelation had come to them and they
[1:56:18] actually were staggering under the
[1:56:20] influence of the revelation that they
[1:56:23] had recreates and knowledge that they
[1:56:25] come from God
[1:56:27] somebody said y'all drunk with the wine
[1:56:30] no not like you think
[1:56:33] no not like you think you bunch of
[1:56:36] preachers act like a drunk people but
[1:56:38] not like you think you see we're not
[1:56:40] drinking Jack Daniels and brandy and all
[1:56:43] these things you see the wine that we're
[1:56:45] drinking comes from the grapes of Canaan
[1:56:48] that come from the land of promise and a
[1:56:51] prophet went over and brought a
[1:56:53] revelation back and then it's been
[1:56:55] squeezed down into a ministry that is
[1:56:58] preaching a divine revelation but the
[1:57:00] power of God and when you start drinking
[1:57:03] the bar
[1:57:05] amen it'll bring something in you I was
[1:57:08] telling the church shell - and you get a
[1:57:09] bunch of drunks together and the
[1:57:11] decibels of the other of the room
[1:57:13] changes they're sitting right right next
[1:57:15] to one another and they start hollering
[1:57:17] they're offering back and forth Amen
[1:57:20] because they're losing their ability of
[1:57:22] senses their senses start losing listen
[1:57:25] when you get drunk enough Amen you lose
[1:57:28] that ability and say oh that's just too
[1:57:31] much that's just too much left
[1:57:32] that's too much this and that's too much
[1:57:34] oh I'll tell you what we need we need
[1:57:37] the pastor
[1:57:38] of the stimulation of Revelation they
[1:57:41] have a child and daughter of God get so
[1:57:43] trip from the presence of pain to drink
[1:57:49] you are already sons take the trait your
[1:57:52] name what's written on the lens but come
[1:57:55] on take the train ain't no ain't no
[1:57:58] pound

[1:58:06] my John Cena's Halloween

[1:58:11] these are gravity less shoes I can walk
[1:58:14] in the outer space and these shoes come
[1:58:18] on the astronaut power is lifting the
[1:58:20] church above the gravity but Laodicea
[1:58:23] and the age of the time and the people
[1:58:25] she's being blasted out but the power of
[1:58:28] the Holy Ghost but a power of God that's
[1:58:33] what's wrong in this in town that's
[1:58:35] what's wrong with all these dead
[1:58:36] churches they took the fire I've gone
[1:58:38] off for the altar and they're trying to
[1:58:41] get the people under a bad idea man but
[1:58:44] you let the fire of God come in the
[1:58:46] church lock the church on fire and watch
[1:58:51] it burn the Holy Ghost begins to move
[1:58:53] think about a fire brothers it catches
[1:58:57] think about a fires it catches you ever
[1:59:00] seen a fire kids brother Timothy Amen
[1:59:02] you let a fire start burning and let her
[1:59:05] win start blowing at the same time I
[1:59:10] feel the fire
[1:59:12] on the anvil of the holy ghost burning
[1:59:15] in the church I hear are we uncommon
[1:59:20] twice they put this fire out he's a pain
[1:59:23] in the flames of the place
[1:59:27] [Applause]
[1:59:39] [Applause]
[1:59:47] before the foundations of the world new
[1:59:50] countries answer the fire of God came
[1:59:53] upon them and made an answer that could
[1:59:56] not be refuted when the fire of God
[1:59:58] begins to learn oh yeah I'm absolutely
[2:00:03] sure but many men are inviting people to
[2:00:06] altars and they're saying we don't
[2:00:08] believe in all these you know why they
[2:00:09] don't because they got no fire on the
[2:00:11] altar and their altars are useless and
[2:00:14] they're ineffective and then they don't
[2:00:16] preach enough of the gospel to even call
[2:00:18] somebody to an altar and if they happen
[2:00:20] to get somebody hungry enough that wants
[2:00:23] to come there's nothing there to satisfy
[2:00:24] so why have an altar why have a service
[2:00:28] like that but if you've got some
[2:00:30] preachers but a fireboard son of God
[2:00:32] Amen that believes on the Holy Ghost
[2:00:35] please some powdered peanut balls until
[2:00:38] hearts will play and say I want some of
[2:00:41] that
[2:00:45] how about some of that had a little boy
[2:00:51] come to Braille I'm one day but early on
[2:00:54] from over North Carolina and sisters
[2:00:56] here
[2:00:56] look what coming to prey on brother Brad
[2:00:58] you were there we've down in Tennessee
[2:01:00] comes he separately he said I want some
[2:01:02] of that my daddy's got I said now that's
[2:01:05] a Christian if your kids want what you
[2:01:07] got that's a Christian atmosphere that's
[2:01:10] a Holy Ghost fine I know the world has
[2:01:12] produced such a religion kids don't walk
[2:01:15] back but you let a mom and daddy get on
[2:01:17] fire with the Holy Ghost and them
[2:01:19] children desire amen they desire that
[2:01:22] kind of life they desire that kind of
[2:01:24] Holy Ghost Oh remember where thou has
[2:01:29] come from remember when you were instead
[2:01:32] and sins and trespasses and all you have
[2:01:35] is a form of religion that God came in
[2:01:37] by the Holy Ghost and filled you in st.
[2:01:40] about you then why wouldn't you want
[2:01:42] others to get the same thing God give
[2:01:45] you you know I was a boy hey man I was
[2:01:50] able to tell that boy it's lucky for you
[2:01:52] that Apostle Peter said this promise his
[2:01:55] son to you
[2:01:56] and that's Linnaeus oh Lord I got your
[2:01:58] car and we watch the Holy Ghost come
[2:02:03] down in that meeting and feel a little
[2:02:06] more you don't have to be
[2:02:16] [Applause]
[2:02:35] [Applause]
[2:02:36] [Music]
[2:02:40] Sandin the flame I see that I see that
[2:02:46] brother man said the Rising Sun said you
[2:02:48] know he said the thing about it is
[2:02:49] there's a mechanics and dynamics and he
[2:02:51] explains that a couple of ways the eagle
[2:02:53] in the chickens then he comes to the car
[2:02:55] remember he said have a perfect car full
[2:02:58] of gasoline
[2:02:58] he said perfect everything's in its
[2:03:00] ordered he said but without a fire
[2:03:02] he said that Carlos said steal there's
[2:03:05] no moving in it you ain't going the
[2:03:07] worst-hit steel is setting there
[2:03:09] he said now if it's that way you would
[2:03:13] be better off with water it's gasoline
[2:03:16] that's right
[2:03:18] but what's when the fire comes its what
[2:03:20] proves if it's gasoline you put the fire
[2:03:23] on that you see if it burns ain't maybe
[2:03:25] you take a bunch of this Inlet you'll
[2:03:27] teach you we're getting down the
[2:03:28] churches Amen you can put the fire the
[2:03:30] Holy Ghost the engines fizzle out it'll
[2:03:33] fizzle out to nothing else and only then
[2:03:35] throw against it and resent in their
[2:03:37] spirits and set down and lock up on you
[2:03:39] amen
[2:03:40] but if it's a teaching of this message
[2:03:42] with power and you begin to preach the
[2:03:44] fire of God it's like a bonfire you
[2:03:50] poured a bunch of guys up and all the
[2:03:53] sudden lights up and it begins to burn
[2:03:57] amen and then Timothy gets up behind the
[2:03:59] preacher with a gas can oh we might as
[2:04:08] well kick that old Bibble while we're
[2:04:10] here
[2:04:18] he's working for God's filling station
[2:04:21] and they're not certain water down there
[2:04:23] they're passing out dance clams and he
[2:04:26] stands up here and bounces that far
[2:04:27] because he knows he knows it for fire of
[2:04:30] God starts burning but odds are gonna
[2:04:33] change hearts are going to change we
[2:04:34] can't change it but got to change it the
[2:04:37] Holy Ghost in the church until the such
[2:04:46] a fire begins to rise up in you that you
[2:04:49] can feel the glories of the embers of
[2:04:51] the Holy Ghost amen you know what
[2:04:53] happens under that all the stuff of that
[2:04:55] fire starts burning like that
[2:04:56] Amen things start dying amen unbelief
[2:05:00] starts dying spirits start dying fading
[2:05:03] scotland's and their power over you you
[2:05:05] begin to feel the unction of the Holy
[2:05:07] Ghost that Eagle anointing starts rising
[2:05:10] up in you you begin to say I can I can
[2:05:13] believe for this I can trust this I can
[2:05:15] do this I can do all things right you
[2:05:20] know you know this is the age right now
[2:05:23] when the Prophet actually said God open
[2:05:26] that book and started calling the names
[2:05:28] off of that Lamb's Book of Life you
[2:05:30] don't know what that really means to us
[2:05:31] that means there's millions of names
[2:05:34] probably on that book would you agree
[2:05:36] that's probably millions of names and
[2:05:38] all the way from Adam all the way up to
[2:05:41] how they those things are in that book
[2:05:44] but this is the first people who knew
[2:05:47] their name was in that book nobody else
[2:05:53] ever saw their name in that book but in
[2:05:56] the last
[2:05:57] days God but bring a message that would
[2:06:00] put your name he would reach your name
[2:06:05] to you in the message of the hour and it
[2:06:08] would call you it would call you to
[2:06:10] retention you see what he was doing he
[2:06:13] was calling you back to what he saw you
[2:06:15] ask before you wasn't always a slave in
[2:06:18] Egypt you mustn't always a slave down
[2:06:21] there before you were there you're
[2:06:22] Abraham's son
[2:06:24] but what slowly sure initial Egypt
[2:06:26] you're nothing different than Israel
[2:06:28] region Amen but the minute that message
[2:06:31] came and called him out and started
[2:06:33] taking him over it took them over but
[2:06:36] they hit that red see brother hit that
[2:06:38] red see last night and they come and hit
[2:06:40] that red sing right but God did not let
[2:06:44] the Red Sea stop them right but by the
[2:06:48] power of the spoken word he opened up
[2:06:51] the Red Sea and they walked across
[2:06:55] dry-rot is that right now I want you to
[2:06:58] look at the power of that believe in
[2:07:00] church do you know how much power you
[2:07:02] have you actually control the Seas your
[2:07:06] type is the moon right but moon the tide
[2:07:09] starts coming in on the earth but then
[2:07:11] said the moon turns and faces the tide
[2:07:14] and it has to slip away
[2:07:15] the tide has to reverse its order when
[2:07:19] the bride looks at it the moon brother
[2:07:21] Ben said see as long as the bride's on
[2:07:23] the earth he said see the tribulation
[2:07:25] can't take place because the enemy's
[2:07:28] trying to come in like a flood but
[2:07:30] there's a bride standing there saying
[2:07:33] I got family
[2:07:35] not yet devil I got children not yet
[2:07:38] devil you see it you watch it but I will
[2:07:44] start coming in and it looks like our
[2:07:46] young people is going to be swallowed it
[2:07:48] looks like the revival is going to be
[2:07:50] over but all of a sudden and Elmer
[2:07:52] somewheres begins to pray and they say
[2:07:54] God you promised us our children you
[2:07:57] promised us a revival for our children
[2:07:59] and they turn and look at that devil
[2:08:01] devil let's not be alone in a God get
[2:08:09] back to your banks I think it's time for
[2:08:16] you to turn the tide on the devil I
[2:08:19] think it's time for you to turn the tide
[2:08:21] in your home it's time for you to say
[2:08:23] devil that's as far as you're going in
[2:08:25] my house of God
[2:08:32] you are not servants your sons and
[2:08:36] daughters of God
[2:08:37] Israel has sons is the last daughters in
[2:08:42] fact when you go what's the top of the
[2:08:48] scripture Miriam and and all the
[2:08:50] Israelites to me them cross that Red Sea
[2:08:52] you know that tide could not come in on
[2:08:55] them as long as Israel was in that
[2:08:59] trench now water can move on it had to
[2:09:02] stand up and actually defy gravity
[2:09:05] holding this place but the minute that
[2:09:07] Israel got out of that trench the minute
[2:09:11] that bride got out of that that's what
[2:09:13] happened all of a sudden the waters
[2:09:15] started flowing in and the whole thing
[2:09:18] was destroyed one of these things this
[2:09:21] Brides going to leave this earth and the
[2:09:25] waters of judgments going to spread
[2:09:27] across it you think about this in a type
[2:09:31] the prophet of God said it like this he
[2:09:34] said we're marrying them gotta cross
[2:09:35] they look back in that red sea and
[2:09:37] actually saw their enemies in the
[2:09:39] lottery but them said which was a type
[2:09:42] of the blood of Jesus Christ it's a
[2:09:47] powerful thing
[2:09:48] gunney tambourines in here this morning
[2:09:50] amen now I want you to think of this
[2:09:53] right here because I was studying this
[2:09:55] the other day and I realized that there
[2:09:57] was actually about 2 million people
[2:09:59] crossed that Red Sea do you mean into
[2:10:03] them
[2:10:04] do you know what actually happened when
[2:10:06] they got across that I mean you can use
[2:10:07] it you know what actually happen they
[2:10:09] got across it when they got across that
[2:10:14] sea they turned around and looked
[2:10:20] and when they look they saw their enemy
[2:10:22] was dead now yeah we might have we might
[2:10:26] have 200 sisters in here maybe I had a
[2:10:28] 600 people make me the third 200 I don't
[2:10:31] know but maybe 60 sisters Amen can I
[2:10:34] hear a rejoice from you sisters
[2:10:36] [Applause]
[2:10:47] [Applause]
[2:11:03] [Applause]
[2:11:09] [Applause]
[2:11:24] [Applause]
[2:11:36] and say that's my little lane recording
[2:11:41] the demographic sister Venus studied in
[2:11:43] Justine the idea of two million people
[2:11:46] they they proposed there was at least
[2:11:48] six hundred thousand women in Israel you
[2:11:53] just heard two hundred what did it sound
[2:11:57] like pull the weights of that red seat
[2:12:00] twenty six hundred thousand women the
[2:12:05] dental exhaust they begin to place God
[2:12:18] through miles away but miles away they
[2:12:25] can see that the storm rising off of
[2:12:27] that sanctuary they can hear the roar of
[2:12:30] the Holy Ghost power
[2:12:32] that's it loop down the banks of that
[2:12:35] well the leader of the bunch Moses he
[2:12:39] stood saying like y'all clap that down
[2:12:42] I got a different Bible my Bible said
[2:12:47] Moses stood up and begin to sing in the
[2:12:49] spirit bin y'all know in the Bible in
[2:12:52] the Book of Revelations it says that in
[2:12:54] the day amen in the great overcoming in
[2:12:57] heaven they will actually sing the same
[2:12:59] song in heaven that they sail the banks
[2:13:03] of the river down there within the Red
[2:13:05] Sea Moses wrote a song on the Red Sea
[2:13:10] that's gonna be Sun up in heaven one of
[2:13:13] these things another little thing about
[2:13:22] that it's the first song they wrote in
[2:13:25] the Bible before David Moses wrote this
[2:13:28] song of the overcoming and historians to
[2:13:31] believe it's the first song actually
[2:13:34] ever written then I could say it was
[2:13:37] contemporary
[2:13:46] sorry it's in the Bible and they sung a
[2:13:49] new song you know like a headlight that
[2:13:51] song
[2:13:51] Chris nobody ever saw a bunch of Pharaoh
[2:13:54] is Egypt down in the middle bottom of a
[2:13:56] scene
[2:14:09] [Applause]
[2:14:40] [Applause]
[2:14:47] I'll tell you what a prophet of God said
[2:14:49] he said it's actually time to worship he
[2:14:54] said do you see when that book is open
[2:14:57] it is the time to worship this is the
[2:15:01] time when the elders worship this is the
[2:15:05] time with the rapini worship this is a
[2:15:07] time when everybody worships not just
[2:15:11] the preachers not just the Deacons not
[2:15:13] just the trustees but this is when the
[2:15:16] young people the elders the mothers the
[2:15:19] wives the husbands it's when every
[2:15:23] it's when everybody begins to say worthy
[2:15:27] is the lamb you said brother Wayne I
[2:15:37] think all this stuff y'all talking
[2:15:39] abouts a little out of water let me read
[2:15:41] the profit I've seen jumping spells and
[2:15:44] joy spells but that wasn't nobody hurt
[2:15:48] mountains run out and the Sun went down
[2:15:50] and everything still took place nobody
[2:15:53] was hurt I've seen meetings where the
[2:15:56] power of God was revealed to the people
[2:15:57] that they were free from the world and
[2:16:00] the things of the world and the joy of
[2:16:02] the Lord filled the congregation they
[2:16:06] stood and screamed and cried and shouted
[2:16:12] to the top of their voice for the glory
[2:16:16] of God I never did see anything
[2:16:19] disorderly I see them shout I've seen
[2:16:22] them scream I sing them look I see them
[2:16:25] dance but I ain't see nothing disorderly
[2:16:28] I've seen the house of God a fire with
[2:16:31] Holy Ghost warship this weekend but we
[2:16:35] sing
[2:16:36] now the water misses the outlet for it
[2:16:39] this is the time to worship books often
[2:16:48] how can she hold her peace God call her
[2:16:52] name
[2:16:53] he spoke my name
[2:16:56] but for the world before heaven I've
[2:16:59] heard my name
[2:17:00] it was cold I never seen anything
[2:17:07] disorderly it's right in order because
[2:17:11] that they recognized that their name has
[2:17:15] been written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:17:16] from before the foundation of the world
[2:17:19] it's not out of order it's in order
[2:17:25] because they saw that their names was
[2:17:28] written in the Lamb's Book of Life now
[2:17:32] don't you leave this meeting of them
[2:17:33] critics it's out there on their ways
[2:17:35] don't y'all watch this and so well
[2:17:37] that's just a bunch of emotion but your
[2:17:39] workup and they're just trying to work
[2:17:41] all them people up and all that I want
[2:17:43] to tell everybody listening everybody
[2:17:44] watch it he meant that what this is is
[2:17:47] in order because when God revealed the
[2:17:50] names of this church Jesus said in the
[2:17:52] Bible that is the time to rejoice you
[2:17:56] and your name is called
[2:17:58] that's a rejoicing little bride this
[2:18:01] message called your name

[2:48:37] and do that at this time stand up Jordan
[2:48:42] have little Jordan through it here that
[2:48:45] wants to be baptized in the name of the
[2:48:47] Lord Jesus Christ he is repented of his
[2:48:50] sins he's asked the Lord to come into
[2:48:53] his heart
[2:48:54] amen to be as Savior and so we're so
[2:48:57] thankful for that that start that he's
[2:49:00] made with the Lord and he wants to take
[2:49:03] on his name and he said you know I asked
[2:49:06] him I said what do you what do you want
[2:49:07] to be baptized for he said because I
[2:49:10] want to have the Holy Ghost and I want
[2:49:12] to go in the rapture and then well the
[2:49:18] promise is under you it's all your
[2:49:21] children is for them that are far off
[2:49:24] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[2:49:27] call and we remember the very promise
[2:49:30] that was given there when Peter gave us
[2:49:33] the eternal prescription they asked what
[2:49:36] must we do and when they asked him you
[2:49:39] know how do we receive this Holy Ghost
[2:49:41] what should we do and these any answer
[2:49:44] the question repent and be baptized in
[2:49:48] the name of Jesus Christ for remission
[2:49:50] of sin and you shall receive the gift of
[2:49:53] the Holy Ghost so this is our promise
[2:49:56] for us and our children and for those
[2:49:58] that are far off right down to the last
[2:50:01] age amen I believe that God will have
[2:50:04] those that are filled with His Holy
[2:50:05] Spirit this is what has promised us in
[2:50:08] this last day so we're thankful to God
[2:50:11] that we can testify that he he's still
[2:50:15] God he's still saving mercy is still
[2:50:18] open grace is still provided for us amen
[2:50:22] and so we're here today to proclaim the
[2:50:24] Word of God now remember there was
[2:50:26] nobody ever baptized in the Bible except
[2:50:30] in the name of Jesus Christ amen you're
[2:50:34] gonna look through all the Bible and
[2:50:35] every time when they went and applied
[2:50:37] what Jesus said
[2:50:39] they knew who the who Jesus was that he
[2:50:43] was a manifestation of the father's word
[2:50:46] and we are here today to testify it to
[2:50:50] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:50:53] because he said whatever you do in word
[2:50:55] or deed do it all in the name of Jesus
[2:50:58] Christ amen so we baptized in his name
[2:51:02] amen because there we are identified
[2:51:05] with him and man we're following exactly
[2:51:08] what they did in the days of the
[2:51:10] Apostles because down to the ages the
[2:51:13] denominational world took and it with
[2:51:16] Tudor lien and change the baptism of
[2:51:19] from then from into from the name of
[2:51:23] Jesus Christ down into Father Son and
[2:51:25] Holy Ghost which is not a name in his
[2:51:28] titles he is certainly father he's
[2:51:31] everlasting father a man of course he
[2:51:34] was manifested in his sonship as a very
[2:51:37] human purpose to to pay the price of
[2:51:40] redemption and he is the Holy Ghost amen
[2:51:43] because there is one Lord one faith one
[2:51:46] baptism one God and Father of us all so
[2:51:50] today we're going to obey the Lord today
[2:51:52] in baptized Jordan in the name of the
[2:51:55] Lord Jesus Christ Jordan the Lord Jesus
[2:51:57] sent me an ordained me to preach the
[2:52:00] gospel into all the world and baptize
[2:52:03] those that believe in the name of the
[2:52:07] Father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost
[2:52:09] and so therefore in obedience to that
[2:52:13] divine command i baptize you in the name
[2:52:16] of the lord jesus christ

[3:04:28] for hosting families and providing food
[3:04:31] and a lunch sacks or and after service
[3:04:34] snacks there that they passed out and
[3:04:36] and you know the meals that were
[3:04:39] providing the hospitality that was given
[3:04:41] even a night Tabernacle you made me
[3:04:43] proud god bless you
[3:04:55] I think it was brother wrong that said
[3:04:59] that you know you have indication of a
[3:05:02] call of God as God places men around the
[3:05:06] ministry that God sins and I'll just
[3:05:08] tell you I couldn't do what we do
[3:05:09] without the the the help the Deacons
[3:05:12] trustees the musicians the sound
[3:05:15] technicians all of them and their part
[3:05:17] and you in every one and every member
[3:05:21] here of this church you're a very very
[3:05:24] important and I'll tell you what if you
[3:05:27] just realize you've got a job to do
[3:05:29] you'd never let your seat sit empty but
[3:05:32] you'd be here every service pulling on
[3:05:34] the gift of God doing what you could to
[3:05:37] further this gospel and man I just saw a
[3:05:39] man raised his hand just a moment ago
[3:05:41] both hands to the Lord as I said that
[3:05:44] and and that's my cousin there Victor
[3:05:47] Middleton he has come back to the Lord
[3:05:49] he's one of the sons that have returned
[3:05:58] oh yeah
[3:06:03] and I'm just gonna make his apology
[3:06:05] public he said brother Tim I come down
[3:06:08] here to apologize for not coming to
[3:06:11] church for the past 20 years and I'll
[3:06:14] tell you what I figure it takes a man to
[3:06:16] come up somebody that's really repented
[3:06:18] to make that kind of apology so I want
[3:06:21] to be right
[3:06:30] and with this God's gonna heal his
[3:06:32] family and you'll turn right back around
[3:06:34] and look there you'll see as young as
[3:06:36] daughter go to run and do his arms and

[3:06:41] is come home

[3:07:02] Kevin ho that's many more than you comin
[3:07:05] home
[3:07:12] hello you say brother Tim why did you
[3:07:15] build such a big church so every
[3:07:17] prodigal would have a seat we're not
[3:07:30] hallelujah and if you can squeeze under
[3:07:34] icy tree just come on it's big enough
[3:07:36] for all amen god bless you it's been
[3:07:39] good to be together with you and have
[3:07:42] this time of fellowship one with another
[3:07:44] and you know as as I said the many ones
[3:07:49] that have come yet got brother Jason
[3:07:52] Jackson that left his home and his Pope
[3:07:56] Evan and he's a pastor he's coming
[3:07:59] that's a big sacrifice to do that and
[3:08:01] come be a part of the service
[3:08:03] appreciate that and very very much and
[3:08:06] then we have other representations
[3:08:08] brother Joshua goth came for had to go
[3:08:11] back home this morning but he was here
[3:08:13] for all the others and so and yet he he
[3:08:17] left representation to be with us this
[3:08:20] morning
[3:08:20] and we appreciate that a little group
[3:08:22] down in Warren and what God is doing
[3:08:24] there thank God for that
[3:08:26] I'm glad that there are there is a light
[3:08:29] in every in every community I've never
[3:08:33] never believed in just having one mega
[3:08:36] church and everybody goes to that but I
[3:08:38] believe that God wants a light in every
[3:08:40] community so they're there for we try to
[3:08:44] encourage and help and strengthen and
[3:08:47] whatever we can and we we have given
[3:08:50] tens of thousands of dollars you know
[3:08:52] just right right here in the United
[3:08:55] States to help other churches build
[3:08:58] churches God not only provided ours
[3:09:00] debt-free but he also has provided where
[3:09:04] that we can help others and we have done
[3:09:06] it amen and we're thankful because we
[3:09:08] believe that God has a bride around the
[3:09:11] world and that's why we went to Japan is
[3:09:14] because we we had a burden in our hearts
[3:09:17] there was a burning desire to see
[3:09:20] somebody else saved a man to get this
[3:09:23] glorious message in their heart and so
[3:09:25] you know that's our desire and to choose
[3:09:29] so that the end can come because this
[3:09:32] gospel must be preached into all the
[3:09:36] world and then shall the income
[3:09:39] so therefore how will they hear without
[3:09:42] a preacher and how can they preach
[3:09:44] unless they be sent a man so we're earth
[3:09:47] who we're thankful to God for His grace
[3:09:50] to us amen less of our hips together
