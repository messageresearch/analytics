cause us to move up a realm higher than what we want we ask it in Jesus amen amen amen God bless you if you turn with me to Revelation chapter 5 I would like to read from that chapter of scripture certainly been a joy to be here with you and many of you have not got to shake your hand or speak to you hopefully we'll get to do that today able to greet you let you know we love you we care for you so appreciate all the different ones churches that have been represented brother Boaz from India over there good to see our brother Fran again amen our brother David iers so nice to have each one of you you know it's just great to be with God's people to enjoy the great things of God who you are I you know you may never heard of me and it's not even important you know who I am but if I can get you to get in love with Jes that's what's really important and I pray that when you leave from here from these meetings you'll be just a little closer to the Lord just see a little more of him we want to get a glimpse of what he's doing in this day when we speak about things no don't sit down and say oh I'll never get this I'll never understand but when we speak about the things of God just realize it's given to you the Mysteries amen it's given to you to know and if God said it it's important so we want to take and listen and see what God has said to us in our generation if you'll turn with me to Revelation 5 and verse saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look their on and one of the elders said to me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beast and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain and having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne and when he had taken the book The Four Beast and the 4 and20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints amen and they sung a new song think of this it brought him to a new level of worship and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by that blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nation amen and has made us under our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the Beast and the elders and the numbers of them was 10,000 times 10,000 and thousands of thousands amen saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessings and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the Earth and such as are in the he and all that are in them heard I saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sth upon the throne and to the lamb forever and ever and the four Beast said amen and the 4 and 20 Elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever ever and ever amen amen God bless you cand we've read in the scripture this morning of of something that is happening in the heaven and it's not a moment twinkling of an ey event but it is a process of redemption and that begins with the lamb and taking the book of redemption and it finishes up with all creation worshiping God and as we look at this today I think of where we are in time I want to be among those that defeat death we had our forefathers our first parents that walked out of Eden but I want to be a part of those that walk back into Eden on I want to be those that are one of those that are counted worthy to overcome death hell and the grave our overcome Hell In The Grave you know I can think of no higher honor to be one of the Bride members who can bring total defeat to Satan's kingdom and in order to do that he will take an abundance of rapturing Grace and that rapturing Grace producing the faith for this hour now I'm going to look in the book of Hebrews 12 verse 18 where Paul is telling his church where they had come to so he starts in verse 18 saying for you are not come into the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor Blackness or into Blackness and darkness and Tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of Words which voice they heard in treated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore so he said you haven't come there but here's where you come you have come to Mount Zion to the city of the Living God to the Heavenly Jerusalem to innumerable company of angels to the general assembly the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of justment made now Paul was dealing with the people in his age to try to get them to see where they were in time for what was what was happening in their hour you know this was really important that he gets them on board and so because there's a great blinding that was going on in that age the gospel was turning from the Jews to the Gentiles and this right here was addressed to the Hebrews the Hebrews or the Jews were having difficulty seeing what God was doing in their hour because there was a tremendous blinding that was going on in their time this blinding was so great that they even crucified their Messiah that's how blind they were and the Bible said if they had known they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory but some of them got so caught up in this blinding that according to Paul they would have not done this at all but because of the blinding that was going on in this their age it went from there into Great Tribulation 2,000 years where the Jews have been a persecuted people because of their rejection of the Messiah as Jesus said in Matthew 24:21 then shall there be Great Tribulation such as what was not since the beginning of the world in this time nor shall there ever be and so for 2,000 years the Jews have been in Great Tribulation dispersed among the Nations A persecuted people because they missed their day and the same things will happen to the Gentiles because there are many who have their names in The Book of Life that had they know it they would not have crucified the word they would not reject the word them but because of this they will find themselves in the Great Tribulation for further purging even as the Jewish did now so it's important that we know what where we have come to now I'm going to speak this morning and we have come to the seventh seal because it is the ending of all things it is the ending of time and the blending of Eternity there are many things that are happening in this day that we must be aware of otherwise we will reject the Messiah and we will miss what God is doing now remember even Disciples of Elijah I'm talking about John the Baptist missed the Messiah missed the coming and they kept following you know even what John had said without seeing what he and it is important for us to see what the message has pointed us to so Paul is trying to get the people to see in his day where they had come and the Ephesian age was one that aimed at the High Calling and then they relaxed they never achieved what was laying before them because they relaxed it was a time that Paul was already speaking and Mysteries were being revealed he says I'm going to show you a mystery we shall not all sleep he was already beginning to speak to them for we which are alive and remain we will not hinder those that are asleep he was starting to give them the revelation of the Rapture Paul was telling them we have arrived at a place and it's a wonderful place I'm going to show you a mystery of what is going to happen what lies right here within our grass right before us but instead of grasping it it wasn't long until the first church aged was something against them he said you have lost your first love and I've got someone against you the first church had already began to fall already they had divisions among them and they had got their eyes on men saying I'm of Paul and I'm of Apollos and they thought this was spiritual but Paul said it's caral and said you walk as men said it's Christ divided and of course this divided chrisan into 40,000 denominations we in the message have not been immune to this we have splintered into many groups we quickly just Fellowship those don't see exactly amen now let me tell you if you think you're way on the top of the ladder and I'm down here I'm coming behind you don't kick me in the face I want to ask you how did you get up here it was Grace that got you what does you was more intelligent more spiritual it was Grace that lifted you there so if Grace put have for others who are coming behind you amen amen so it's not my goal at all to get you to fall in love with me I want you to fall in love Jes now here's a principle in God's word when God gives a word that word cannot return unto him boy let's go back to the first in Eden he see even though Eva's given a word be fruitful and multiply replenish the Earth but she didn't do it as God said she did it the way the serpent amen and they multiplied but not like God said but God's word could not return to him there had to be somebody still born of the spoken word there was a virgin who would conceive by the spoken word bring forth the son and that would be Christ and from him would come a whole new race men and women Bor God hallelujah amen that's what the new birth is about it is to give us the birth that we should have had before the fall you see the word couldn't return to inv void so that word would lay dormant until finally the seed came the one that would bruise the head of the serpent and correct what he did so that we can have the right birth the reason we have to be born again again is because we had the wrong birth but when you're born again you're born again of Incorruptible SE of the word of God that lives and abide forever so when the word is given like in the in the time of Moses you know Israel came to their Kadesh and because they wouldn't go into the land that did not make the word of God void somebody was going to go in that land that generation but there was a people who did they were given this opportunity to go in now we in this age are having difficulty seeing the truth you see Leia is prophesied to be blind and it's going to take the of the word of God you're going to totally Miss what God is and you a word rejector and it's the word is the only thing that can save you when you reject the word there's only one thing left for and that is to go to tribulation more purging and we don't want to go to the tribulation amen that's not my goal for you or for me myself I don't want to be in the tribulation I want to go in the rapure I want to be a part of that amen yeah it's a foolish thing to go into the tribulation foolish virgins will be there amen but there's a wise who will be whose eyes will be open to the truth there is a word that promises that there will be those alive and remain the coming of the Lord I want to be among that and I don't want to miss what God is so I just say oh God you sent eyes in this day don't let luk Warmness don't let Le blind me so I can't see the pride lays before me all my hopes and dreams nothing the glory that be reveal us it's very important that we St what God is doing what is really important the Ephesian AG that we have read about they relaxed drifted they never achieved but this word cannot return to so there has to be a people brought back to the same place come back again exactly where the Fe church was and this time enter into the full promise friends we cannot perpetuate the ages we're at the end of the ages there are no more ages to come we are through and God will not fail somebody's going to fulfill that word somebody's going to believe it somebody's going to be standing there and changed say be somebody that to give the word preeminence say it might as well be me amen that ought to be in your heart today to be me amen I'm not going to let anything between me and that nothing that Satan has with all he has to offer in this scientific achievement nothing can be compared the glory that shall be revealed amen am Paul was speaking of these things of how there were better things in the New Covenant what was in the old now we're standing back here today those bunch of dummies back there how come they didn't know this was it should be obvious Jesus the lamb was better than the wly animal lamb you know we look back and we see this is obvious to us but he is dealing with the people who are going blind amen amen so he writes a whole book to the Hebrews to tell them we got something better amen now you know we have something amen we know sorry we know that the New Covenant is better than the old amen so he would go through the book of Hebrews and he said it's been made so much better than the angels we got a better Revelation it's a more excellent name so it's a better name see the whole theme to The Book of Hebrews is we have more we have something greater we have something better these are key words in the of Hebrews amen again and again he is saying it's better it's greater what we have is greater well it should be obvious that the new C Covenant is better than the old Covenant us today we're looking back and it's without question but I want you to understand as we are criticizing them we are also having difficulty understanding what is better what is more what is greater because of the blindness of the age because Le oia is prophesied to be blind the Gentiles will be blind like thews so in this day I usion to keep people from seeing what is important amen and it's going to take a continual washing by the water of the word with so that you will count other things so so that or else you will count other things greater importance than his word so it's going to take a continual washing Leia has to have this Zeal to repent say well I've T this for years you have to be willing to repent no matter what amen you see what see what the word says you might have held on this and thought it was right but you have to come to the point where you can repent the Zeal of the hour Lord whatever I want to be right search it daily be willing to be corrected by amen amen that's my motto for my life whatever God I Want to Be Right amen now in the book of Hebrews he said we are persuaded of better things so there's a better end he spoke of the of a better priesthood he speaks of a better hope of a better Covenant of a better mediator a better priesthood better promises better sacrifices you see a better future a better country a better Resurrection see a better blood he's trying to get them to understand this is a better blood it's a more powerful blood it is a superior priesthood Jesus was Superior to Moses he was Superior King than David everything is greater better more amen trying to do his best to get them to see the Fe and age was brought to their Cades bar of entering into the land they looked at it they aimed at the High Calling and relaxed they didn't enter Israel did the same thing they came up and they looked into it tasted of it and went back into wandering and for Seven Ages we have been wandering around and around wild we'll Camp here we call that Lutheran we call Camp here we call that method and we camp here and we call that Aus you see we we all of these camps of where we come through the Wilderness but that's not the Homeland am and for Seven Ages we have went into wandering but we have come back to the very spot where it is our time to cross the Jordan to enter into the full inheritance we have come back to where Adam and Eve was where the tree of life stands before us and the tree of knowledge stands before and it has reached its height it has come to his glory and we're making a choice today of which tree we're going to partake us will we take life or will we take knowledge amen so brother Bram tells us in a message the Paradox we're promised according to Revelation 10 and according to Malachi that there has to come an Ephesians to this now remember he takes Ephesian and parallels it with Jos so as there was a book of Ephesians you know there was the Book of Joshua Joshua is where they entered into the land and Ephesian is where we are told that we enter in to all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and so he said there must come an Ephesians that these Sevenfold Mysteries of the word of God must and it's in the Le I believe that we're there I believe we're right in the shadows and it's Joshua just before the Fe raised up so did John the Baptist raise up just before the next so you see it would be John the Baptist that would bring an Ephesian in that day into a new covenant by introducing the lamb that takes away the sin of the world amen amen now so as we look at this I I want to I want you to get something clear I'm not to Joshua I don't claim to be him I do claim to be a Caleb with Joshua and if you wonder who Joshua was there was only one man to whom the Bible came down with a hand turning the pages Joshua chapter one and then goes down to the verse 9 verses with his finger and says as I was with Moses as I was through the Wilderness as I brought him down through Methodist all the way into Street and I was with them back there I will be with you I will not fail you you will inherit this land and you will divided for the people now remember under this Joshua commission he's got to take and show us what is the definition our land you see what is the Border amen so he says don't take Mount SE that belongs to es and don't take that over here to Moab that belongs to the children of lot I'm not going to give you what belongs to the 144 I'm not going to give you what belongs to the those with white Rob that's not your inheritance your inheritance is the land the whole word of God open book your inheritage is where the Messiah the resurrection will take where Rapture will take and youve got to be in that Amen to receive that to receive the Messiah we have come here to see the Messiah that's why we have returned not to build another organization not to put up new signs that say message church not to make followings of men we have come here to see the Messiah amen amen now you can't add nothing to the book or take nothing from it Revelation 228 whoever will take or add one word or take one word his part will takeen be taken out the book of life we cannot add or take so therefore we know that Luther could not get to W the reformers not on down they didn't get it all but what they had was gos truth but in the last days we are given understanding by the word that we are going to understand because it'll come an Ephesian age to it amen amen so we needed to Joshua to tell us what's in the land and what is our portion amen amen now you know it's kind of like this we got to know where we're at told this story before but Mary's telling it again you know I was on a trip with a brother you know and I I went and got my map and he said oh you don't need a map I know exactly where we're going I know all the roads and I you don't need a map I said you don't need a map I need a map you know where you're going I don't know where so about 2:00 in the morning I said can you drive an hour let me rest he be glad to I said now there's a turn down here you don't want to miss put I I know the way you can you can you know and so about an hour later I wake up and we have come to a stop sign and he said brother Tim the road is just disappeared I'm waking up and I said roads don't just disappear I said he said well yeah it just disappeared and I said get your mou and tell me where we are how to go I said it don't work that way I said you can't look at this mou and find out where we are you have to go in that store there and ask that man a question where am I and when you find where are then I can take the road map to take us where we're going but until I can find out where we're at on this map this map isn't no good to me and that's where we were in this we had a road map we didn't know where we were or are we in the first age even any age are we in the last age where are we and it took a prophet a SE to come and point to the SCP here you are so now we can take the r and take it all the way to the oh yeah amen amen so you see we had to have a messenger he said here you are you're at the last age you're at the very place that the first age was you went around cirle and you come back to where they left off and you're going to inherit the same thing they had so they were standing on the brink of the coming of the Lord they were standing on the border of the unfolding of the mystery we we have come to the end of the ages and we have come to the seventh seal and the seventh seal is end the end time because God kept the secret from other ages he reserved it until this time you know Paul was saying we were alive and remain but you see it was Kept Secret for seven Gentile ages but in in this day we heard a strong Angel began to Proclaim with a loud voice for someone Worthy is there someone worthy that can take the book and loose SE it's sealed up from us it's mystery truths are unknown open it up Lord and this messenger from the earliest part of his ministry somay the lamb will come forth and take the B and he will loose the seals someday the worthy one will come in this last day this book must be taken the lamb must come for take them up and loose the seals now when John the Baptist preached in his in his um forerunning introducing the Ephesian of that age going into the land of the New Covenant he he introduced the lamb he said behold look the lamb to take away the sin of the world well this was a to New Direction nobody had ever preached this before it had not been the message of previous time they were satisfied with their rituals with their woly lamb their sacrifices they were so sure this was the way it was supposed to be but they had been given a substitute that work until the real thing came but when the real thing came they could not accept what God now it was not just a substitute but now The Real L of God and he was introduced here he is behold the L to take away the sin of the world while even as he's preaching some of his disciples are listening and they continue following John instead of going after the L and it parallels the age that we're in because so many want to just follow the personality of the mess without following the one he pointed to and that's why they're still having to look for the messenger to to return because nothing can happen till he com back totally missing what God is doing because they never saw who the Messiah was the Messiah was not a prophet the Messiah was Christ the word so some of them they could not see who the Messiah was can follow another men and after some new doctrine and then we form clicks and clams all around the message that are centered on personalities and the reason for this they never saw the Messiah they keep looking for another and when he's off the scene they have another and then they have another or they live on the memory of of the past and it's a vicious cycle and it only causes hurt and unbelief and confusion disappoint it'll never produce faith in your life until you come to know the Messiah Jesus Christ who is the word when you know the word the Holy Ghost is here of God is here healing is here Mir here are here everything is here you get focused it doesn't require some man's personality it requires the person amen so Revelation 52 says and I saw a strong Angel proclaiming voice who's worthy to open the book to loose and we have heard a strong angel in this day Proclaim with a loud voice who is worthy where is that loud where is that worthy one and if you examine brother R's messages from the ear Tes throughout his ministry he was making this procla Proclamation who is worthy this must happen that the lamb takes the book loes The Seal amen see there's never been an age where the message of the Lamb coming take a book amen there have been many sermons preached on Calvary the cross and what Jesus did death and his burial and his resurrection and those are important but there comes a time where the focus begins to change not taken away from Calvary not taken away from the purchasing work but realizing that there is more of the Lamb's work that in Calvary there is a further work of the Lamb tman Redeemer he does more than purchase us but he claims us and that is the rapture part that's what he's done in this day he claimed you out from among denominations even as he claimed Israel from the Nations you from the denomination and bringing you to himself taking a bride what is he doing his claiming work amen amen amen now this is where people are confused because they think because the lamb is doing his claiming work by claiming the book and all those whose names are in it that is no longer doing the purchase that is true that is not true his Precious Blood will never lose his power all the church amen amen so his blood doesn't become ineffective because now he advances but his blood still the power to deliver the violent sinner to save the Lord to heal the cast devil Amen to move among his people it's his claiming work but people get confused but let me know let you know his blood is just as affective to cleans sin the day it was shed on Calvary but his kman Redeemer he does more than purchase our Salvation he is now claiming the book and take possession of his Redeemed by rapturing them amen amen amen now once he gets you safely out of his way out of the way takes you in a Rapture to the marriage sear of the Lamb he's going to do an avenging work amen amen because he's also Kinsman Avenger he's going to pour out wrath on those amen the very devil that has troubled you the things that has bothered you situations around you this God's going to plag them he's going to work do the work of Avenger because his kinsman redeemer claims and he aves your enem there's coming a time just right ahead where it's going to be payback to the devil I'll show you in the Bible second Corinthians 1:5 second Thessalonians which is a manifest token of the righteous Judgment of God that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God for which you suffer seeing it is a righteous thing look look a righteous thing God recompense or to pay back tribulation to them that trouble you and to you who are troubled rest with us amen when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty in flam and V taking that know not God that obey not the gospel who shall be punished with Everlasting destu from the Pres for the glory of when he shall come to be glorified in his Sint and to be admired all that believe because of our testimony was believed in that day am amen amen so I put Satan on notice R My Kinsman he's on your Trail you see Satan you know what you've done to me but My Kinsman has taken up my cause amen and he's on your Trail sat you're not going to get away with nothing you can bring your trouble you can bring your your heartaches you can bring your cancers but you're not going to get back with anything there won't be no place to hide no place you can go amen he'll take you and he will bind you and he will let you walk your subjects fall and go down you see your whole kingom and he's going to reserve him until the end time and Satan will be the last to be destroyed because leaders die last to watch his whole Kingdom fall I tell you what we're going to be standing there rejoicing you are going to out live you will overcome you will be here canc destroy when sickness is go when old age and death is defeated everything is G still be here it's not going to overcome you it's not going to take you down the Bible said that you will look narrowly down the and you will see that worm that amen hallelujah amen hallelujah the tribulation is where he does his veng work and fils of judgment is poured out now in all of Paul's writing if we would read of the letters Paul the Romans Ephesians Colossians Galatians Thessalonians the Hebrews never one time does he say where is that worthy lamb The book must be taken it wasn't the cry neither was it the Cry of Iranian colba or Martin Luther Wesley you don't find it until this day this becomes the burden of the word this becomes the Cry of M who is worthy this book is closed it's sealed with seven seal it must be open for is the title to every promise of God title to Healing title to the Holy Ghost it's a title to a new body title to the Rapture amen and it must be open the book of the Covenant which has been sealed up must be open amen and it became brother Brandon's passion have that book open to be there and see it open bring that book to a people so they can be the people of the open book Hallelujah we are the people of the open it's no longer closed amen we have come to the breaking of the sea we have come to the breaking of the silence we have come to the place of Matthew 2436 but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father amen you see we shared yesterday in Acts 1 and verse 6 when they had come together they had a question for the Lord wi thou at this time restore the kingdom you see the blinding was going on so even the disciples didn't understand what they were to be looking for they didn't know where they were trying to find out where we at is this what you're going to do next and he says about that it's not for you to know the times of the Season which the father has put in his own power these are things that the eternal spirit me and my human form I can't know this I can't even tell you right now because I've come here as eternal spirit as a man and in man form I don't know this amen so he begins on the aisle of patmas after his death and Resurrection when he has ascended back to God and here he comes back to John to give him the mystery of his coming amen but every won't know it it will be reserved for an end time people now so but but he pointed them to what was important coming that they must see what you must see that you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost come upon be witness to me in Jerusalem Sam all part he says there's a coming I want you to see and it's not going to be the coming of where I'm not going to tell you about when I'm going to restore the Kingdom of Israel you not to know that this is held in the father's own power it's not permitted for me to tell it but it's something left for a later time you must know this you must get this you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost amen did he come in Acts two he came he came as a pillar of fire liit of fire and he empowered every one of them out under the power and under the anointing of the mighty Angel amen amen hallelujah amen now you must know what coming you are a part of you must receive that coming like in the book of Acts and if you receive him the Holy Spirit there is another coming in this last day and that is the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ where we will meet him but why would God not allow the mystery of his coming to be made known to this because Satan would have used this knowledge to do great damage with had the early church known that it would be some 2,000 years or seven Church ages before Jesus returned there would have been no one died ready and prepared to meet him you see they were already relaxing there would have been nobody under expectation for the Lord's return and since this was withheld every soul went to the grace believing for his coming and they will rise amen with the same Bel so they went down ready and they will come up ready amen amen they didn't die in unbelief the Bible said these all died in faith go by the way of the Grave we don't die in unbelief we're not nonbelievers because we die we die looking for him come back seeing the part of the coming that he's expressing himself in our day now Paul says we have come to Mount Zion amen now notice here as we look at this you know we have come to Mount Zion m z is the bride we have come to the bride you know we're with the full grain amen we we we have water baptism we have the Holy Ghost has come the blood of Jesus has a the godhead has preached perfectly and the revelation of the Rapture is being given he said the Lord himself from heaven with a and the voice of the Archangel and the trumpet of God getting so close to it winding up and they're standing right on the brink of the Rapture and they're looking over in the promised landine and they're already seeing the order of his coming what he's going to do what he will do as he descends they're already getting Revelations of his coming I show you a mystery and there are things already starting to happen them and they're standing right on the Edge and Paul is saying to the Hebrews Hebrews chapter 12 he prefaces this and is what we have read there and he speak in Hebrews 11 David bar Samson speaks of Abraham great Heroes of Faith has gone on before them and they he tells them in in in Hebrews 12 they're like they're on a grand standand and they're cheering you on it's a great cloud of witnesses and they can't be perfect without you and he's already seeing a great cloud of witnesses we're already so close on the very edge of something Jesus has went away the Old Testament saints went with him com and Paul is preaching we which are alive and remain he didn't think he was talking to you some 2,000 years later but God holds Us blind to things until the time he don't show us everything and he was showing the great prophet Paul many things but he wasn't showing him there would be Seven Ages and you're going to go your way and sleep Paul he's preaching it like it's going to happen right now any minute we we which are alive we will not see death will be changed but he didn't know he was prophesying another day of the end time amen but it had to be written in the scripture the mystery of his coming amen hallelujah amen there were things that was said of John oh what is it to you if he ter shall I come so there was a around John would see death some of his disciples anxious for the coming of the Lord John's getting old now you see how great his hair is now he's getting feeble John tell us about his coming Jesus said you wouldn't see death see the Lord's coming and because of this s which John corrected you know he but because of this say God had the federal government to arrest him and take him to the aisle of P so he could get a little time to himself so he could show him his coming you see the dumb devil don't know everything he does to us is really going to work for our hallelujah amen amen you know there was a child One Day by the name of Moses and the devil knew that there would be a boy that God would raised up there was a prophecy said that a deliverer would be born and Satan stood there to kill Moses when he was born and put laws in place kill all the male children and God said you want to play this game I'll play one on you what I'm going to do is have you raise my deliver you will educate you will clo him and then he's going to come out one day and realize and he'll defeat you he destroy your am hallelujah amen now sometimes the devil thinks he's going to keep us in this no God is just letting him feed us give us some conveniences here but he's rais out a deliver in this last people who's going to bruise their head people who is a devil defe who is over and there is nothing the devil can keep you from amen you will overcome hallelujah amen blessed be the name of the [Applause] Lord now John sees things beginning to happen it's all in symbol parabolic form and he can't he can't say God can't say now there's going to be seven Church ages 2,000 years but he writes it in symbols he makes it in Parables because it's not for everybody they can't know this but at the end time the mystery of God will be finished amen so he says there are seven churches and they have seven character istics they they were characterized in an age we we know now but they didn't know they were characterizing an age you see if those words were truly to the leans the city of Ephesus it's their message and not ours but this was a message of Jesus Christ not to a city but speaking to an age and he's using Seven Cities to symbolize Seven Ages to come so there are seven stars in the right hand Jehovah now God's not holding Seven Stars like seven sons like seven of our sons in his right hand these are symbols of seven Messengers that he would send to give light in the time of Darkness Christ has left the Earth notice it's a time of Darkness because there's seven lampstands amen they shine in the dark Seven Stars that come out at night but when the sun comes up you don't need lamp you don't need Stars you don't see them amen but right now in this time of Darkness we need the light guide us we need the L the way the amen so John is caught up even the lamb is a symbol it's got seven horns it has seven eyes on the horn have you ever seen a lamb that could take a book out of the hand you know out of the hand of him that had on the thr got hes and he reaches up and he grabs with his hes this is no woolly lamb this is symbolic you see God is writing in symbols John doesn't even know that he's a symbol because John is representing the redeem a group of people will be caught up and raptured at the end of the age and even the 24 Elders are representing a gr people 12 Patriarchs and 12 Apostles of the old and the new redeemed of all are all represented in the so it's all written in symbols and it parable mhm and people scratch their head and they write books about it and it's not able to be understood because it's not time for it this is why the Book of Revelation is a mysterious book and it continues to be a mysterious book people because they can't understand but God didn't put it in there just in the Bible just for filler paper I one more book end and just let me give them something to chew on but no it's a book of mystery you know like a mystery book in the beginning of the book all kinds of characters are introduced you don't know who the villain is you don't know who the bride is you don't know who the groom is but as the story comes down to the end of the book amen you know who the villain is you know who the elect is amen you know who the bride is you know who the groom is and we are not at the beginning of the book we are at the end of the book The Mystery becomes amen amen and John gets so caught up he types out the bride in Revelation 4 he is so quickened till he actually becomes the bride and type and he's caught up before the throne and he sees the Kinsman there he sees the lamb who come to get this question book of title that is in the hand of the one who he sees it unfold he he sees the lamb take the B sees him open the seals he watches these symbols under these seals and here's the final Revelation has seven Thunders now utter their amen and here's the last thing the last mystery that is needed to cap off the all the Mysteries and he hears the Revelation he gets it amen they're so close to finishing it up God calling a Rapture they got baptism right godhead right predestination right everything is ordered they're waiting for this last mystery and John hears it but what happens all of sudden God says no you can't do it I can't let this be known it's not time it's got to be written in the Bible I'll leave it in symbol for but you can't tell the meaning and there is a reason because it has to be written in the word it can't be something outside of the Bible be in the scriptures amen amen but brother brandham said it was hid in the book written Under symbols even as he did with Daniel but it could be seen you know it could be seen as symbols but they didn't have understanding until a prophet came and this is what he's saying in the days of the voice of when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished amen amen now if you take that in context with Revelation 10 it's the mystery of the voice of God that had been sealed away amen the seven God had said something but he sealed it up now but he says this is going to cap it off and John gets it he hears the Revelation they are that close the Thunders are uttering their voices I was about to write and I heard what they said God said no you can't write it's in the Bible but it symbols but I'm not going to let you give interpretation because it's not the time for it to be made known why couldn't he tell John why couldn't he let him tell we know now because there were more names in the book and God hold it back to hold it back I can't end it all yet call a Rapture there are more names that have that are in the book that hadn't been manifested on the earth amen amen John you can't tell this because if I give them Rapture and Fai amen the Rapture will take place and these other seeds will never come in the manifestation but I have more in my family what's in this Ephesian age you do this now there will never be an evening light Tabernacle evening light Tabernacle or there will never be a Cloverdale Bible or light in the evening time church so therefore if I tell it now it'll call the end and there will be a Rapture so I will have to hold it back because otherwise there won't be an Iranian wle or br there wouldn't be any of them they would never come into manifestation so I can't the church can't give the my hold it till the last [Music] day now can you imagine being that close having all the Mysteries they were seed this church was a seed Church was a grain of wheat it should have been taken and harvested taken into the Garner amen amen but instead God planted it right amen so that there would be more amen so God had more in mind than what was in the Ephesian God had some better things for us he had you in mind let me say it like this you how many of you were born let's say third or fourth or fifth or thereafter in your family raise your hand you was the third fourth fth in your family you weren the first two you know we we have we have here Brother David he's got three children what have he said boy and a girl that makes a complete family we don't need no more we got one what about you you wouldn't have been here but God had something more in mind to make his family complete and so God did the same thing I can't Rapture this age I've got a planet so there will be more coming there's more in the book that what's been manifested on the earth I have to wait until every one of them are manifested on the [Applause] earth you know I wouldn't have been here either I was the fourth child you know God would have stop you wouldn't be in the picture you have never come into manifestation even though Paul in his age could have been raptured and they were so close God had something more in mind he had you in mind and all of this time the lamb has been interceding through these Seven Ages on the behalf of ignorance providing Grace now maybe I don't know know all the history it is said of Martin Luther that he hated the Jews some say he smoked the PIP some ate cursed and drank wine we do know this Luther was sprinkled in titles of Father Son and Holy and I'll just tell you you can't make the Rapture with that kind of Bap right amen but Luther would have believed this he was a predestinated seed Wesley would have believed this but it wasn't given yet there was no restoration them back to the original therefore God provided Grace for them and they will be in the great Resurrection be part of the Bride of Jesus Christ because they were predestinated live long enough God's allowed you to live so as you can see Luther had so many things mixed up there was a lamb sitting on the and if that lamb could atone for Luther's his unbelief what about your and your unbelief therefore he was interceding a bloody lamb and every time Satan would come I wipe Luther off of the Earth the lamb would say but that's my son the lamb would say take all his sin and put it upon me and he does this until every name in the book amen hallelujah amen now we have come back to the same point that the first age was we come back now to where there's a people on Earth who believes every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God so you see as we look at this we are right back to the place where man fell in the garden where we go back from time into eternity we're right back to where they were in the New Covenant as the original grain to be the original grain again in the first seal brother ROM says now the lamb is showing John in the SYM of the church the for the church you know what to write he just he just shows him now don't tell this just what it is and don't go down John and say now this is just what this is now what's under this seventh seal don't go down and tell that for if I tell John that down all down to the age the whole plan will be brok it's a secret see nobody's going to know when I'm coming just coming it ain't for it ain't for my business to know when ready so God sealed the understanding of the of the seven seal book from those ages Until the End Time begin every seal is written in the book but the interpretation is with it is sealed under symbol the symbol is written but the interpretation is held back and yet John heard the interpretation it was an intelligence intelligent utterance he was going to write it but he was forbidden to do amen amen now in Revelation 81 when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for the space of an half an hour that's all you know about it something's been silent it represents a time of Silence then come to Revelation 10 Revelation 10 it becomes a known voice it is prophesied to become a known voice let's just go around through Revelation 10 and let's look at the symbols Revelation 101 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothe with the cloud a rainbow is upon his head and his face as so this is the Angel of the Covenant none other that the Lord Jesus Christ amen because he's the angel of the Covenant represented by the Covenant the seven colors of the rainbow all right amen his face is as was the sun this is not the veiling of God this is the time of the unveil of God this is when his light comes in the evening time and his feet as pillars now this is symbology you see here now he's coming but this is not the physical Corporal return of Christ this is Christ as he comes in the form of the word to a Prophet this is the logos the spirit now to come into the messenger bring a message of Deliverance now it's the hour of deliver home time AG it's the seventh age here we are here we have come we have come right here to the scripture we have arrived at Revelation 10 are you with me but notice what he said his feet were as pillars of fire well the Bible answers the symbology let's go to Ephesians 1 verse and the Bible said and he put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the which is his body the fullness of him that fth all right amen so you see he's the head but his body is on Earth come on amen amen this is why when we see even the picture of the cloud it's just the head why the body is on Earth amen and what is it it is his feet is in his body and his feet are pillars not a pillar of fire but pillars of fire now where is that in the Bible and suddenly there came a sound like a Russ and what happened to divided of people hallelujah am you are his [Music] feet amen you're his feet through which heck amen hallelujah and he had in his hand a little book open Revelation 5 he was closed but now the lamb has stepped forth and he comes down with the open book amen amen it doesn't remain in the heavens he comes out to bring it to you he didn't redeem it for himself he was already redeemed but he became a man and as your Redeemer the K A kman he took your place and there he stands head of the he takes the book for man but he don't leave it in the he comes down with the open book as brother said he would tear off the seal and hand it down amen what was he doing bringing to you an open book amen amen and he set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the earth now this is no 275 me tall Jesus with one great big foot over here one great foot over there this is symbol amen amen these are symbols CU out of the Landes a beast and out of the sea Rises a be and he puts his feet on both of them amen he is saying you cannot come into power until I lift my feet when I take my bride Hallelujah and until then she got her feet on your amen so there's a out the land that's the American spiritwood You by a message have been able to put your Fe the head of that be and there's a beast that come out of come out of the sea which was Rome and you are not B under the Trinity doctr Hallelujah am amen and they cannot come in the power until the bride hell break as long as we are here the spirit of God in our Liv pillars of fire got you conquered of tell you little children we are not a defeated people [Applause] amen hallelujah [Applause] amen H hallelujah praise the Lord amen what a wonderful savior hallelujah amen we have come to Revelation 10 amen yes and he cried with a loud voice it's a message he shouts booo no he shouts and when he shouts it's like one a lion Ro as Amos said Surly the Lord God will do but he reveal it his secret the lion is who will not fear well God has spoken Hallelujah am and when he had cried Amen in his message seven Thunders and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voice I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from seal up those things the seven Thunders uted amen and write them not so God stop the revealing that time stop John don't tell this silence silence forever right amen not forever and the angel keeps watching the angel that I saw stand on the Sea on the earth heaven and swear by him that lives forever created heav things that there the Earth things that that there should be time that there would be no more there's coming a time I'm not going to hold this back amen amen so he says but huh silence this yeah am now you don't start a complete thought with but I like brother what else did I say about him before but you don't start a complete thought said silence this but in the days of the of the seven Angel when mystery theery of God which has beeny would be finished because he's declared prophesied of his coming down to the Ages Every Prophet was prophesying of the coming take one prophet Abraham well take another en what with God seventh from Adam amen come on and he was not he was raptured the seventh Church age from the seventh from the the seventh from Adam the second we're from the seventh from the second Abraham what about that mystery God wrote it and hid it in his life it was Christ the mystery of Christ hidden in Abraham but reveal to you in this day that the old woman Sarah 2000 years old is going to bring forth the prise am and to do that you're going to be changed so there will be a kind of time I can't keep it quiet you're going to know what the Thunder uttering the last Revelation to be given that will cap off all the will be given to an end time people but I'm going to give Rapture in faith in other words I'm going to give them the faith that I'm going to tell them you are the people of the open book and I'm going to open the whole book to amen amen amen you don't lose it with PRI with prob into it the just shall live by but that's all he could see W would come along but you got to be Sanctified He pry into it try to understand but in this day the understanding amen the mystery is revealed so this half hour Silence has to do with the end time has to do with our Lord's return it's the very thing that Jesus said the Angels did not know seal is open John sees there's a half an hour silence this silence is symbol it's the symbol of the Sabbath seal Sabbath seal is represented by a Time just like white horse is a symbol of the ver seal and like God the fifth seal people and when this sea was open had been silenced now yeah brother bandam said there's no symbol to give it away he referred to a horse rider no white one there's no red one there's no black one no pale one there's nothing like that silence just a time of and John when that first seal was open seeing the symbol he sees a white horse red black a pale a multitude without number under the alter 44,000 and we come to the seventh seene something has been silent not forever but for a time and it's represented by a space of a half now I'm just going to deal with some thoughts that people some Tau the reason there was silence in heaven in the space of a half an hour is because heaven had emptied the mighty Angel Revelation came I don't want to argue but if that is true then why didn't the heaven become silence when God came down to Moses in the burning bush or when he appeared as eloh Abraham was Heaven silence did Heaven All Of Heaven empty out because all of them were there there was God and two angels when God came down in the fullness of the god the fullness of the god dwelt in human flesh their their God is present and embodied in a man man Christ Jesus why was Heaven in silence for 3 33 and A2 years or for three and a half years see just don't add up others come along and say we are in a time of Silence now you know we're in the seventh seal and it's all silence That's why nothing is happening you know there's no Miracles there's no healing no deliver nothing happening in the bride it's a time of Sil no no the reason that is happening to you because Leia has blinded see what God is you're not becoming the voice of the res because we are to be the voice of them that come out of dark denom we not dead we are alive we got the king to death and of hell man Satan's kingdom cannot stand against us I can unlock any door so what was it it was something God had s for time and now in heaven space of a half an hour where something has been silent but not forever just for a space of time you know for seven Church ages this has been silent amen but in the days of The Voice of the seventh angel I'm going to break the silence I'm going to let you know whatst is it's not going to remain symbols anymore and and it won't be just cities over there in some mysterious stars in his hand funny looking lamb up there in the heaven it won't be seven lamb there all of a sudden Revelation begins to dark it won't be that just a white horse and we don't know who it is some say it's Christ even brother ROM thought it was Christ preached it that way amen a black horse we a red horse we don't know who it is but now the voice of God speaks out amen and the Thunder of God begin to speak clearly lay in the scripture from our view because it was hidden behind symbol that only a prophet could Reve therefore God silenced the voices of Thunder but he reserved them to be revealed so the seventh seal is the seal that ends up all things you see when it breaks it the end time Begins the silence is broken amen the end time process begins to happen it starts bringing about the end of the Gentile it begins with the seventh angel the sounding of his message there begins to wind up all things concerning Redemption and finishes up by ushering the amen it covers the coming of the Lord and the coming of the so brother random says It's the End of Time for all things everybody ends it's the end of the struggling world the end of the struggling nature it's the end of everything it's the end of the trumpet it's the end of the V it's the end of the Earth even the end of time everything runs out in this time at the end of the seventh SE it's even the time for all the Millen amen so when the secret is made known he's letting you know you are now in time of coming and what am I doing I'm going to send you Elijah the I'm going to send the to introduce word is Christ and that that word become fles Hallelujah and a bride created on Earth and when I get her all together into the word I'm going to take her in but I'm not stopping there I'm ending up all things I'm going end up the trumpets so the seven trumpet will call Israel reveal their Messiah and then we'll come into the next FS they will be poured out for of judgment and come on to the of the Millennium all under the seventh the seventh seal is not a singular event amen it is the beginning of the end am when it open it ushers in the end time how does it do it it comes out look it's kind of like a wedding you know in this wedding there's a bride there's a grand right mm so what what happens now I'll just talk about American Wedding girls like candles in the way we have seven candles and all of a sudden now here we come and we're viewing seven candles but the wedding can't start until the last Candle is lit and the last candle is the last Church age and it's light is the last messenger and so it comes out here the call but all of a sudden here comes the last candle now we're ready music changes out walks the groom with his best man now the bride never gets the best man come on now you you can get that the bride never gets the best man we're not marrying the Propet so he comes in ushering in the groom and here he is how do we know he's the he's the word he deserves the thoughts he's never wrong amen amen amen amen but now watch then the music changes again and here comes the bride Hallelujah now look all eyes turn the Bri and she is ushered down the aisle on now and here we've had it all of the groomsmen have taken place they standing on the IR luley hallelujah it's wedding time marri marriage of the lamb and his bride made hallelujah amen so now so when it comes brother bradam says it's like a Roman can from this explosion another explosion five more stars come out another here another display another so the word comes to the prophet rejected and crucified and the the church is rejected she's identified as the of Revelation 17 the bride is called out and that causes the people to be called by his name amen and they go in a Rapture amen and then the seventh seal concludes unfolding pouring outes all these other thingses up the what I'm trying to tell you friends is that the end has begun amen amen amen amen and you are part of the prophecy amen amen amen now think of it brother Brandon said the seventh seal mystery in the book of redemption but it's broke the lamb breaks you see the seventh seal mystery in the book of redemption was think of it's brok the silence is broken it's no more silence anymore it becomes a known voice now we've had every kind of idea brother said I'm going to tell you my Revelation and I'm not prone to be a fanatic he said I am I'm ignorant of it I'm not given to Delirious or carrying on imaginary things I've said things that might seem strange just as certain as I stand on the I had the Revelation that it's in a threefold manner that I will speak to you by God here's a revelation what happens is those seven that he heard ther and was forbidden to write that's what the mystery is laying behind the seven consecutive Thunders rolling out so that's what the silence was God silence and reserve them to be revealed in your time so that blessed are your ears here and your eyes and it's no longer in symbols any but it's been reveal hallelujah amen amen Amen brother Bram said it's the secret no one knows about joh was forbidden to write about WR even a symbol about it that's why there was no activity in heaven it might give away the secret see so great it must be included because it's got to happen in other words this has got to be revealed must be made known but it's such a great thing silence for that's what Revelation 10 is seven Thunders he said utter Right In A Row 1 2 3 straight Heavens Couldn't Write it Heavens couldn't know it nothing else Satan could do get a hold of it do great damage and he went out in but now that you're here and there's no more anges he said you're in the you are in the hour of his coming you are the people of the open you are the people of the amen to the others it was Kept Secret but it's not it's not a secret you now know what the Thunders uttered the interpretation now has been given we know it's no longer symbol amen it's now Revelation it's been revealed amen amen now this is this is why God shows these things in our day there are three phases to his coming the shout The Voice the trumpet the shout what was it the message the voice of the Archangel show me any other place the AR except Revelation and then trumpet amen you see this was the third pull of brother BR people are looking for the third po well you're looking for is the manifestation Resurrection fishes all of those things that's not the third po that is manifestation the power that lays in the word with me salvation deliver speak in the storm but he said I got my mind on this message that's that third p and you see he was given the King this is not a king this is the word of the Lord put it in your hand that third P amen amen he said now now when he begins to declare first P healing second proph third the opening of the word the Myster Reve there's no more higher order to Reve Prophet can beated the word and remember third po the third po the opening of them seven to reveal that hidden fruit that been sealed in the word look brother brandom had always look for another gift another greater gift of Miracles gift of healing greater gift to the miraculous and that's what he thought he was going to get he had his first pull was given a greater giftal but this was now the third pull and it was a greater gift of healing than any of the others because it was the healing of the CH taking her out of false and restoring her back to the bride to be the bride she was the beginning do you hear what I'm saying amen this was his Divine Healing movement the last of his ministry to heal the church sin doubt confusion do you know this alone identifies brother BR as the messenger the angel of of Revelation 10 if brother Bram did not reveal the seven he was not the seventh angel yes sir but if he was the seven only he could tell what had been every other person with their idea this idea or is that is that it's all wrong because you see it's like in the days of Daniel I told you this before but in the days of Daniel God wrote something and nobody understand God spoke it might as well be a thunder understood amen and this one came out and G that one came out and Matthew Henry but nobody understood Prophet came said here's the am what is it he's no longer guessing he's no longer proven in the book that's why he could say the seal open that which I proved that that which we were all wondering about about the beginning that book is open and we can say say Lord who can propes amen hallelujah amen brother bam said from the seventh angels and he says messenger of the seventh seal message from the seventh Angels message in Revelation 10 SE to the trumpets between those two times I want you to catch this Angel of the amen amen you see that was brother Brand's message his job was to break the silence amen amen now listen folks I know there's been a lot of ideas but Peter could not write John was forb so the Seven Virtues cannot be the seven that is not what believer believe amen that that which was now been revealed amen and if anyone listen we are able now to preach a restored gospel somebody

his kingom brother BR said that seven was that last Angel's message very notable to me this is that seventh SE and he tells us the angel was the seventh SE the seventh angel in the constellation notable Angel seven seal he said well brother Tim the seventh seal is not revealed then it wasn't very notable to brother Bram there's no need of even sending the seven because if only six se we only need six Angels right amen amen but the seven and last one of these seals when they're open said they're found re there was a mighty which is Christ you know what brother brandom said what those th are no one knows but we need know and it will take a prophet to get the Revelation no what God has no other way than to bring messenger of Mal reation is going to do two things one according to Mal will turn the hearts he will reveal the Myst of the seven in Revelation which are which are the revelations contained amen and it will be mystery truths that brother the seven Thunders which equals
