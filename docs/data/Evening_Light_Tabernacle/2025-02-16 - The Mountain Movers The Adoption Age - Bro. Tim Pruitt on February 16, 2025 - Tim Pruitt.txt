Ron col girls here that's what I call them Rachel and Monica God bless you you're so good to seeing you today here and brother Jerry sister phis wanted to say thank you for all the visits phone calls everything and we also have this stanky family here it's always great to have you folks come up amen we miss you we remember the many many times that you've come through the years and what a blessing you've been into our assembly and brother stanky was an elder there and served as a deacon for a long time with brother Daniel Williams and and uh we've just enjoyed having them in our company and our fellowship and such a privilege to have every one of you today amen I I wish I could just hug every one of your necks some of you will have to wait to glory to do that but the rest of you maybe we'll get a chance to shake your hand sometime amen and just say God's blessings on you let's turn to Romans 8:14 for our scripture reading this morning and if I missed somebody I I just want to say that I'm sorry about that but anyway we're happy that you're here God sees you um and uh I saw last last Sunday the dun family was here so we're glad to see them back in church with us pray that God just so revive their hearts and give them an anchor in Christ there is nothing like in Jesus and you don't want anything that anybody does says or Acts or behaves that would ever keep you from serving Jesus amen it's like I've said many times you know a lot of times we we have problems with people and situations come and even problems with the pastor of the church or whatever but what did Jesus do to you he ain't done nothing mean nothing but good amen I've had people hurt me and offend me do things that I oh my it it just stabbed me under my heart but you know what did Jesus do to me he did nothing good but good amen let's read from Romans 8:14 keep it in mind our theme who art thou a great Mountain Thou shalt become a plain and The Headstone shall be brought forth with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it verse 14 says for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry AB a father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God you know that's exactly what happens when you receive the Holy Ghost it is the spirit of adoption and it causes us to recognize who God is and at the same time we are recognized and placed as such look in verse 177 for it said if children then HS Hees of God and join HS with Christ so we're placed and and are given Airship with Christ through through the holy ghost that if we be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestations of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who had subjected the same as in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves for that great final day waiting for the adoption that is the Redemption of our body amen God bless you you can be seated I'm going to be speaking on the adoption age this morning and there's a whole lot to this subject and maybe we won't even get to it all today but we will just kind of maybe introduce this subject as we go and and uh at the same time I want to recap with some of the things that we have been ministering on and I hope that you if you were not here that you've been keeping up because it's very vital and and important subjects that we're speaking about um of the events of this last days that we can know and make our calling and election sure but this is the day that all of Heaven and Earth has been waiting for the age of adoption words the sons of God are manifested as the Bible said that that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together and Paul would say even now so as we think of that I mean he could realize that there had been many wers several things that had been done in his age and his time already Christ had come the Redeemer he had paid Redemption price he was the lamb slain and it had been done in God's mind before the world began but now was manifested upon the Earth and not only that but the life of that lamb had come back on the day of Pentecost and men and women were filled with the Holy Spirit they were actually God breathed the word became flesh as the spirit of God was manifested in these people but he said even now even right now the whole creation Groth and travaileth in pain together and I I would say that as we stand here today 2,000 years later seven Church ages later and we uh we have had great things that has happened in our day it's been a time of restoration where the word has been restored and the mysteries of God revealed and seven Thunders that were hidden from the other ages have now been revealed to the church as was promised in the last day and that it would happen in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he would sound his message so many great things seven angels coming from that Dimension representing the the completion of the church ages and that we are now um in the very finished time and and age and the messenger has already come and gone and here we are today yet even now that the whole creation granth and travail it together in pain as I look upon today men and women and and that are that are coming of age or getting older if I would say and you know we We Grown the we feel our creation groaning within ourselves and we are longing of course for the Redemption of our bodies because 2,000 years ago the promise was given for the Redemption of the soul and so that has been the main theme of The Gospel now for 2,000 years but now we are changing into a different cycle where that the theme becomes the Redemption of our body what the great Prophets The Messengers that have Herald down to the ages and have screamed out and and typed out and foreshadowed is about to come to pass where that we will go back into Eden and back into Mort into immortality from mortality and be changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye so you see we are in a day where the message is of a rapture it is of a resurrection it is of completion and full restoration and full Redemption As we sing sometimes that's what seven angels in the cloud represented was full Redemption you see that we are here in the last day in the completion of the cycle uh of redemption and it's no longer the initiating of redemption but now the emphas begin to change as we look now from the part from the part of him doing his purchasing work um at Calvary to him now doing his redeeming work or moving from his intercessory work to his claiming work and here we are in this last day where he is claiming a people for his name's sake oh I'm so glad to know that I'm one of them that have been claimed as a the Bible said the spirit beareth witness with our spirit that we are sons of God that he has recognized us as his sons as his daughters in this last day I'd like for you to put up for me Revelation 10 and one because we have been speaking about how this is so revent to us in this life's age and just keep that up before us for a moment and display it so before us to remember how that where we are in this time and scriptures that are so revelent to us in this in this hour light has been shown on what was once Mysteries and and uh Shadows are Parables and now it's no longer parabolic but now it's becoming manifested words that were laying in the Bible now becoming God breathe and the spirit unctions them as it Goes Forth to manifest itself and find flesh to reveal itself in this is the day that we are in and he said and I saw another Mighty Angel hey and and this is important to see that angel is Angelos which means messenger so I saw another Mighty messenger oh no this is not a man this is this not a man this is the spirit of God coming down as his own messenger he comes down from heaven remember God has made a promise in this last day that the mighty one Christ himself would descend and he would descend from heaven and he would do it with a message with a shout and we can see that here in Revelation 10 verse one that the mighty Angel comes down and he he comes from Heaven he is clothed with Cloud as a messenger of his Covenant he comes and and I want you to consider this that that Jesus came 2,000 years ago as a messenger and the mediator of the Covenant so why would it be that in the last days in Revelation 10 why would this be the spirit of Jesus coming again in this last day a spiritual forerunning of his physical coming so here he comes down with the open book The Covenant this can be none other than the spirit of Jesus as he alone is the mediator remember there is one only one mediator between God in man and that's the man Christ Jesus so if one is coming as a mediator then it has to be Christ it cannot be another man cannot be a bishop it cannot be a PO hope it Cann not be a prophet it cannot even be an angel in the sense of one with wings but it can be only God it can only be God as the messenger of his own Covenant amen the Holy Spirit coming down the spirit of Jesus descending Hallelujah to anoint a people in this last day are you with me amen he alone is the mediator the AR arbitrator the facilitator of the word of his Covenant so he comes down with his Covenant in his hand he comes down with his buck in his hand I want to ask you then how foolish is it of men today to declare that his mediatorial work is over amen how could his mediatorial work be over then amen because there had been a dispute in Revelation 5 there was a dispute in Heaven over is there a man worthy amen so the judge on the throne finding no man became a man amen in order to take the book for man I want you to know he had it as God he didn't need it as God Amen it was man that lost it he lost the title to immortality he lost the title to God life and eternal life am God didn't need that but the devil couldn't take it and Adam lost it and became subservient to him amen but Jesus came Hallelujah to win it back Hallelujah to win it back as a man for man isn't that marvelous how incredible is the story of redemption the very Act of him taking the book is a result of his as of his work as mediator and then his arbitrator who settled the dispute over the question title he by his Spirit comes comes down with the book to hand it back to man do you realize you're the people he's handing it to do you realize you are the people he's opened it for amen do you realize you are the beneficiary of his of the benefits of what he did so keep my scripture up now amen Revelation 10:1 I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud why a cloud because it's a powerful manifestation of God's Authority and His Majesty amen amen he was always associated with the cloud and the fire and the cloud and the fire right right amen and a rainbow was on his head oh my a rainbow over his head or up on his head here he was in the fullness of seven colors representing the entire complete Covenant amen hallelujah amen this is the Covenant Angel only Christ can be and his feet where he touches the Earth is his body the church amen as pillars of fire for the fire divided itself into portions on the day of Pentecost and friends that's where he's walking on the earth that's where he's putting his feet that's where he is overcoming today that is where he's putting his foot upon the head of the serpent and his bruising the head of the serpent that troubled your life and your life and your life and that habit and that complex and that sin and that sickness come on church amen think about it here he comes there with his feet as are as pillars of fire and I look out here today and I see pillars of fire all over this building men and women who have been l with the fire of [Applause] God whose feet possess the gates of their enemies and he had in his hand a little book opened no longer sealed no longer closed no longer question title Hallelujah no longer held back but every promise open up to you the age of adoption a people coming into full inheritance amen didn't we read that to you a while ago didn't we read there that that he that we have been we have received as HS as of God and HS and join HS with Christ you see here he comes he has it but he ain't satisfied just to have that he wants you to be a joy there with [Applause] him Hallelujah he wants you to enjoy the benefits I tell you we are a people today enjoying the benefits of what he did in Calvary but not only of what he done at Calvary but what he's done in our day amen now this is the day that heaven has been waiting for and and this is an hour where that he's finishing up Redemption so the next verse says and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth why would it speak like that because twofold when you see when God speaks it is as the king speaking amen even in ancient times the lion represented the king and and here he he is the final voice he is the supreme authority he is the one wigged in light and when he shows himself in the heaven with seven angels and a cloud picture was taken it was all wigged in white showing what the Supreme judge hallelujah amen what a day we're living in what an hour when brother Brandon would take an even look at that cloud and he said look he's looking over to the right I wish I had a picture of it right now he's looking over to the right where he pardoned The Sinner where he gave Mercy this is how he's looking I mean people want to say Mercy is over we are the greatest display of Mercy that there's ever been Hallelujah the very message God said in this day is a message of Mercy it's Grace coming to a church church it's the Capstone coming with double Grace favor upon favor it's God coming to a virgin an angel coming to the Virgin and saying hail Mary highly favored and when he cried during his shout seven Thunders uttered your voices now we know the story John was going to tell us what he said but God held the meaning back let's look at verse seven and I want you to understand in verse S when he says after he's saying seal it up don't write it that he swears by him that liveth forever and ever but in the days of The Voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets so God God promised that it wouldn't always remain silent amen but all the secret of his coming would be revealed in the last day through a prophetic message think about that verse 10 says and I looked I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and I ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I'd eaten it my belly was bitter and we sat down and made another organization just became another denomination and perpetuated the ages so what it is yeah as soon as I'd eaten my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy sir now you must give voice to what you have eaten it's got to be displayed in your life if I said these Sons shall follow them that believe you're going to be the voice of that scripture if I said baptize in Jesus name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you're be the voice of that scripture if I said Holiness you're going to be the voice of that scripture whatever I said you're going to eat it and give voice now Paul disclosed that Christ does three things as he descends so we'll look at 1 Thessalonians 4:16 so there are three phases to his coming which can be see here in in first Thessalonians 4:16 and for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first so three things he does as he descends first it is a shout that's first pH that is a prophet bringing a message remember we hear the Thunder's voice what God God had held up of his word until a prophet comes now the shout comes and it comes to bring the people of God back to the homeland of the word and then with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain should be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord amen so hold before them right now verse 16 and let's just examine this we know what the shout is but it says with the voice of the Archangel now Archangel I'm going to go over this for a moment because Archangel means chief of the Angels ruler of the angels and it is mentioned in Jude 1:9 of Michael being named as an archangel so let's look at that scripture Jude 1:9 Yet Michael the Archangel when contended with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses Dar not bring against him a raen accusation but said the Lord rebuke you because it was not time to bring judgment to the devil that's right are you with me so what did he do he he Dar not bring a ra and accusation against him he couldn't condemn him to hell he couldn't even bind him for a thousand years because he still is permitted by God Amen because he is a tool in God's hand remember that the devil is only a tool in the hand of God and God lets him work in order to bring about Redemption and the power of redemption yeah when he created him he knew what he would become but he didn't make him come become that he didn't make him a devil he made him an angel beautiful full of wisdom all of that until he become exalted in himself then he fell now I want you to notice but the Bible said that Michael is seen here now here he's named Michael and the name Michael is who is like Jehovah or who is like El who is like Yahweh the one who is like Yahweh amen because why he is the Angelic theic manifestation of Jesus himself now as we look at this Michael was was seen disp in with Satan over the body of Moses and I want to ask you who else but Christ disputes over men's body that's right come on amen he listen Christ will dispute with Satan over your body oh yes he does amen he disputed with with with Satan over men and women and boys and girls body and would cast Satan out didn't he not amen he disputed with Satan over the widest son of name he disputed with death over the body of Lazarus amen death Decay and everything else had to give way when he disputed amen he desp spirited with the devil overtaking Lazarus and said Lazarus come forth and by his word restored him back to life again we're talking about the work of the mediator we're talking about the arbitrator at work we're talking about the Redeemer amen who can contend with the devil over bodies Hallelujah I remember the day he contended with the devil over my body I was lost and out in sin I was a sinner and on my way to hell but she contended with the devil over my body so that my body could be the Temple of the Holy Ghost he said Satan that ain't your body that's my [Applause] body that's a body I have prepared for me you have possessed it you you have rued it you have wrecked it with every kind of sin but I come to claim it what is mine and I just want to say to you the final rebuke will come to Satan when death is rebuked and the contest is fully won and the dead in Christ rise as I said Michael means who who is like God one who is like God he's shown in the Book of Daniel as the intercessor let's go to Daniel 12 and verse one at that time shall Michael stand up why has he been sitting down Christ has been interceding for 2,000 years come on Amen but he is rising in this day to finish up Redemption amen and he shall stand up the great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people oh thank God for an intercessor there shall come a time of trouble such as never since there was a nation even to that same time and at that same time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book so who's all going to be who is all going to be delivered everyone whose name's in the book is that right God knows exactly who they are he knows how to get them some it takes a long time but he gets them sometimes the battle is long and hard but he gets them he's going to win that's right he's been contested with the devil ever since Eden but he's going to finish the battle now you might question me on that well this is from beginning ending a Gentiles dispensation and at that time Michael shall stand the great Prince Michael was Christ of course who he was Christ of course who fought the Angelic Wars in heaven with the devil amen San and Michael fought against each other well brother Tim that was back in 55 well after the seals in Christ the mystery no notice Lucifer in the last day is doing as he did at first what did Lucifer do the first thing that Lucifer done to separate the fellowship of God and man he wanted to build him a United Kingdom a greater Splendor and seemly more cultured a greater Kingdom than Michael Christ had Lucifer at the beginning his purpose in heart was to achieve a brighter and greater thing in heaven that Christ had is that right by seemingly a more cultured more beautiful more Splendor than the kingdom of Christ do you think we have automobiles in the Millennium and airplane see see what Lucifer is doing you wonder what's that got to do with it because he's creating himself an Eden amen trying to build that more cultured more beautiful more Splendor we we'll just we'll just make man have eternal life here we're going to figure out something that unlock the key to aging only god holds that key amen yes but oh we we'll fly to Mars we'll pollute that too amen you think we'll have automobiles in the Millennium no we won't need them we'll travel like a thought in fact to the matter is heaven will not be that far away now and he says many of them verse two which of of them that sleep in the dust listen when he stands up many of them that sleep in the dust shall awake some to everlasting life some to shame in Everlasting Temp and they that be well eyes that will shine as the brightness of the Firmin and they that turn many to right rightousness has the Stars forever and ever when did you ever see in your lifetime a star go out when did you ever see Mars or Jupiter or any of them quit shining come on they were shining when you were born they' be shining after you're gone let me tell you something friends when all the Earth and everything of this civilization is gone we'll be shining in the heavens with God forever eternally with him now not only that but we see Michael doing the work of intercession disputing with Satan I'm just showing you Bible Revelation 12:7 now you know the brother Bram in the third and fourth seal tells us that when Satan is cast down the bride goes up so he places the Rapture right here in Revelation 12 now we know that it happens at the end of the leodan age and is depicted in Revelation CH 4 but after Revelation 4 between 4 and 19 or different all different kinds of scenes and they're not necessarily in chronological order that's right so they will go from a scene from the the seals to the vials the or Trumpets the vials it will go from scenes of of of a woman um on a moon and and um the the the sun is as is at her head and and the 12 stars that are around her and all these things show different kinds of things we'll move from that scene and we'll move to then to Revelation 13 of beasts rising up out of the land and the Sea and then we go into Revelation 15 and 16 and 17 and show Christ's redeem and work with a with 144,000 and then it will show the Judgment of the great and and and place her all these things all these different scenes now brother brandham said anything between Revelation 4 and 19 that it has to happen back over here in the seven Church ages if it if it pertains to the Gentiles so now again if we're looking at this we see this scene and we could go through it it's a beautiful study of Revelation CH 12 that I don't have time to go through this morning because I can start with verse one and show you the symbology all the way down cuz as I said it's a beautiful story but for the sake of this sermon we want to see verse S and there was war in heaven now before there is Armageddon before there is a battle on the earth there is going to be a battle in the heavens and I want to just tell you it's taking place right now there is war going in the heavens amen as two opposing Spirits are facing each other say well how in the world does the dragon get in the heavens when he was cast out well that's a very good question because originally he was cast out and he came down to the Earth looking for a way back that's right and what did he do he found a weakness in Eve and he got Eve to submit to him and she in turn said look here Adam look what I've done and he took her quickly to himself amen but in doing so he became subservient to Satan and sold his place that he operated by the word in heaven so then every time that sons of God will go to appear before God Satan is there to oppose them so job goes to appear before God and Satan's right there to accuse is that right to accuse job before the Lord he is accuser of the brethren we see in Zachariah we won't have time to go to that scripture but you see in Zechariah Joshua the high priest and he as he stands before the Lord what happens Satan is at his right hand to oppose him so you see every time sons of God would appear in the heaven Satan is there to oppose him and say they have no right to be there this is why Paul says in Ephesians 6 we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness and Heavenly places you say brother says high places listen it's the same Greek word that is translated that he has made us to sit in Heavenly places Paul's using the same word King will change it from Heavenly to high it's all the same word our battle is in Heavenly places that's why it's hard to pray on because as you begin to take your position of sunship the devil is there to oppose you he is there to distract you he is there to accuse you and if he can convince you of something that is under the blood and that will hinder your Faith he will do anything he can to bring up anything to accuse you to keep you from taking your lawful rightful inheritance as a son or daughter of Goden awesome he is called the prince of the power of the air atmosphere amen but he's going to be so driven out of the atmosphere until that's where we're going to meet Jesus is in the air I hope you're catching something there was war in heaven and his angels Michael and his angels fought against the dragon remember remember in Daniel when a prayer was being made by Daniel and here three weeks later here comes the angel Gabriel and he said I would have come earlier I arrived here sooner but there was a war in heaven and if it hadn't been for Michael coming to help me I would not have prevailed I'm glad there's an intercessor I'm glad there's someone that comes on our behalf so that our prayers can get through and our answers can come back Hallelujah so you look at that for a moment and and you realize you know war was in the heavens and and they you know holding by the blessings I'll tell you what you may wonder what in the world how in the world what what did Satan do you know Satan stirs up strife and trouble and everything else Daniel was the third leader in the Kingdom he had duties of the priest of of of a prince I mean and he he had responsibilities before the king that he had to fulfill you can imagine as he got down to pray Satan stir something up and here somebody comes in and reps his prayer here the king wants this done El prompto you know the king wants this done this is hey there's a war broke out here you got to you got to administer do we have finances for so many troops to go you see there's every kind of opposing thing that's why brother Brandon said when you get down to pray he said the washing let don't don't let the washing hinder you you know everything you know the children everything else get in there and lock in until you get in the presence of [Music] God oh yeah I'm guilty as you are sometimes just praying those prayers and God bless so and so and Lord help so and so but oh I get so convicted sometimes of saying God we need to get in that atmosphere where the Holy Ghost speaks back where the spirit of God comes down and intercedes amen and moves through us and speaks things that we couldn't even utter in a language we couldn't even utter and you will you will come and speak through us the things that needs to be said as we work as your servants here upon the Earth but I want you to notice that there was this war in heaven and Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels but I want you to look at the next verse because this is lays the hope of every believer and prevailed not amen when we read the end of the book your adversary ain't going to win there is a war going on in heaven but he prevails not Hallelujah and neither was their place that didn't belong to them originally but he took from Adam in the beginning that the book gives you title to and write to that place of dominion and power as an adopted son and Prevail not in their place right was not found anymore in heaven I wonder who then is sitting on that Throne I'll tell you he has made you to sit with him in Heavenly places positioned with an authority as an adopted son that's what adoption will mean is placed we'll get to it as we go along now I'm laboring on some of this for a reason and maybe we can catch up some of the rest of it but look at the next verse and the Great Dragon was cast out oh listen this is where brother Bram says this old serpent called the devil and Satan that deceiveth the whole world all the way back from Eden he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him Hallelujah now do you realize when Satan is cast down the bride goes up amen do you see in Revelation 9 And1 that put that scripture up Revelation 9 And1 he is a fallen star but do you understand you are not a people that are falling you are people that are rising ascending it's Rapture hour the very Act of your conversion was a in rapturing up it was an astion bringing you up from the pits of sin and bringing you into and elevating you into sunship now so you see key was given to the bottom of pit I saw a star fall from Heaven notice this and he opened up the bottomless pit so he has the authority then to bring hell on the earth and here he comes Satan and his angels with him notice now verse 10 and now we turn from that view of verse 10 now Revelation 12 and10 let toggled back there and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven re Revelation 12:10 a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accus them before our God day and night hallu somebody water shout hallelujah this will shows you what is happening to your accuser he is being cast down amen oh hallelujah look what look now a loud voice where in heaven look the very casting down of Satan brings Ascension the Rapture of the bride and now she is shown in heaven saying with a loud voice now now is come salvation wait wait wait wait wait wait wait now has come salvation I mean my goodness we really now salvation I thought we got salvation back at Calvary no not full salvation because the Redemption of our body has been withheld until the age of adoption that's right and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is coming salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accuse them before our God day and night verse 11 and if you're wondering if all this was Angelic battles I want you to examine the scripture real close and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb stop this one moment never was one drop of blood ever shed for an Angel that's right Angels do not have access to the blood the blood was shed for you and me amen and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives into the death Hallelujah so you can see now Angelic battles become human battles here we are now on the earth and it is being fought in heaven fought on Earth all at the same time and conjunction and you're fighting for your position and Authority as a son or daughter of God to have to dominion over sickness over death over the tomb over the restraints of the Tomb over Creeds of man come on church amen and they overcame him Hallelujah by Blood what blood the blood of the Lamb yes I know yes I know Jesus blood can make the violence sinner clean how clean brother Tim you never did it in the first place totally gone never attributed to your predestinated seed it's what Satan did when he was using your body it's not what that seed ever did but now that the seed has been germinated and come to life no more do I do the Deeds of Satan these hands that used to serve the devil only serve God this mouth that used to serve the devil only serves God somebody help me preach Hallelujah when you realize you overcome by the blood of the [Applause] lamb and they and the word of your testimony testifying what the word said of you therefore Rejoice your heavens and ye that dwell in the but woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil has come down to you having great wrath because he knoweth he has but three and a half years we're right here on the cusp for that soon as a bride leaves it's all hell breaks loose with Satan coming down we don't know if we got Satan Superman in our government amen we don't know but we know he's Rising that's right come on church amen so these manifest these manifested sons in the last day operate under the anointing of the mighty angel I want you to just keep up Revelation 10:1 now these manifested sons in the last days operate under the annointing of this Mighty angel now let me just show you the scripture let's go back and see a a type in the scripture let's go see the POS or or shall I say the negative because we are the positive to the scripture and we look back to the first Exodus and we see a man by the name of Moses and Moses tried to deliver God's people by his intellectual understanding he killed one Egyptian but he didn't deliver Israel now it is true with your intellectual knowledge you can go to AA and use men's knowledge and quit drinking the desire still there but you can you can become a reformed person you can kill one Egyptian but it's not Deliverance the church can have programs of psychology yeah and with their philosophy train people to be good to their wife be a good father be a good parent a good mother and treat the symptoms of sin but there's only one sin cure and that's the blood of Jesus Christ it is the Divine vaccine that inoculates you from sin now if we look at this for a moment Moses remember tried to deliver God's people by intellectual understanding he believed the message cuz his mother mother and daddy taught him that represents ever young people rasted up in the message that's right you know what's right what's wrong you know you are to be a deliverer you know that you are to be a serpent Bruiser you know you know you know you know you know you're taught you're trained and everything but all that training can do is just kill an Egyptian just one never deliver the people never remain you know still remaining under bondage get you to reform be a better boy be a better girl like I said maybe be a good husband come to church be a tith payer but still a denominational church member exactly but I want you to understand once positioned and placed in the presence of The Burning Bush Moses returns to Egypt with more than an intellectual conception but with the power of the mighty Angel hallelujah amen God who had came down to deliver Egypt from Israel from Egypt's bondage now under the power of that Mighty Angel oh oh my goodness I want you to look the difference between him and that intellectual anointing amen and I understand you know we we intellectually have believed the message and we have preached it and we got the mechanics all down but One Moment In The Presence of the Dynamics that Pillar of Fire Moses leaves from there under the influence of a mighty angel Hallelujah somebody with me amen I hope you're following this I hope it's sitting down on the inside of your soul and realizing friend the power of the mighty Angel God himself who had come down to deliver Israel yes sir what did he say I've heard the Cry of my children I've heard them and they're beat with taskmasters I've seen them with their three cornered clubs you'll know if you if you follow the message you know blasphemia name he tells about a three man with a three Corner Club supposed to be my father beating someone who was supposed to be my mother with a three cornate Club every time she goes to get up he hits her again and down she goes and lays her crying and quivering and tries her eyes again hits your hand again we we were slaves sometimes you know you young people who had never been through that don't understand but we were tied down with Creeds of man hit time and time again with clubs of doctrines of man to keep us in submission are you with me made slaves and dare we we were helpless unable to do anything but I want you to understand you see God did something in our day besides giving us another intellectual conception or another intellectual just a a new understanding and new doctrines to the church but God sent the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost to Deliver Us From The Three Corner Trinity Club come on and all the other clubs hallelujah amen and you know I I want you to see this God said I have heard the Cry of my children I have seen what the taskmasters have done and I am come down Amen to deliver them Lord the Lord himself had descended as an angel in the bush and God spoke to him out of that Pillar of Fire that's and he sent him back with a message of delivering his people that's his message this morning I don't care how you're bound I don't care what complex I don't care what generational curse I don't care what dogma of man I don't care what Creed we're coming out of it hallelujah amen we're going to go out the Bible said like Israel did with a high hand we'll go out screaming I'm not a slave anymore Hallelujah even as long as we're in this body we're slaves to mortality but we're not even going to be slaves to mortality we'll be changed in a moment in the twinkling of I now under the power of that Mighty Angel he plagued Egypt he turned a rod into a serpent he swallowed up the serpents of the impersonators you know Pharaoh tried to do some bargaining chips you know he said I tell you what you can only go so far you know you you you can only go so far but don't take your women or your children just you men go and sacrifice to your God and and and and or stay right here stay right here you can have a festival and you stay right here he said no we don't believe in so far religion amen we're going to go where the Lamb's blood flows freely and where we can have the Passover somebody help me preach amen we're going to go where the power of God is amen we're not just going to go so far we're going to go all the way into the promise and guess what we ain't leaving a hook behind we're taking our children we're taking our grandchildren we're taking our wives we're taking our husband we're taking our grand parents we're all going amen is there somebody in this church today said I ain't leaving a hook behind amen I'm claiming my loved ones I'm claiming my husband I'm claiming my wife I'm claiming my da I'm claiming my children Hallelujah and we can do that because we are under the influence of a mighty angel that says let my people go and I don't care how many generational curses you have been under how many mental strains and nervous Str and things has followed your family and spirits of pornography are expence or what that has hung on for years and years and generation after generation you are people that are cycle Breakers devil defeaters and ser [Applause] bruisers and I'll tell you what Satan need more hard-headed you get and the more you say I'm not letting you go the more we taking the word and pl it we'll beat you with plagues we'll take the word and reing down the power of God on you amen if we got to strike the dust and create flies if we got to call frogs out of the river if we got to turn your now God In The Blood Hallelujah under the power under the anointing of this Mighty Angel we go forth in his name all impersonators brother J forget the impersonators what we have swallows it [Applause] up people are so afraid oh to testify of what God did well in Pentecost back there they abused that and they did listen I don't care I don't give a hoot that's right Janice and jambre wants to come up and rise up and impersonate let them do what they want what we have will swallow them up but I tell you what I'm going to lift up the serpent by the tail and I'm going to hang it but hold it before everybody and say here cancer was defeated here alipa was defeated here pornography Was Defeated here s Was Defeated I going hold the Ser up b h and I'm show the world I'm going to show the Believers God still rain and he still healed and he still delivered and he's still the same yesterday today and forever I'm going to declare he goodness and his wonders Works to my generation and to my children's generation and my children's children limit God if you want to but it's time we take the shackles off of God you'll limit him by refusing to testify well I don't think the church Testify the healings there well okay then if we don't do it who's going to do it we sure can't depend on the devil to do it if the children of God don't scream his Praises who is or you're trying to exalt yourself I'm trying to exalt the name of Jesus let his name be lifted High amen for he's the Holy [Applause] One this same Mighty Angel is seen coming down in Acts chapter 2 oh you didn't think there's New Testament for it did you you see Acts chapter 2 parallels Revelation 10 the Pentecost you see there is the Pentecost you see in the last day amen notice it wasn't no supper room it was an upper room it wasn't a church Society it was a place of ascension come on this same Mighty Angel seen in Acts 2 and what do we see in Acts 2 much like those in the verse Exodus scared you know afraid doubting confused oh Moses Moses back off a little bit you know you made a pharaoh act more T to us do you realize he don't even give us straw for our bricks do you realize he's doubled the labor do you realize what you've done you ain't delivered us you just made the devil mad well I tell you when you see the devil get mad you know the hour of Deliverance is at hand I've seen it too often I'll see the devil raiseed up I'll see him act out and manifest and when I see him begin to speak out of people's mouth and Wither in their bodies I know he's about to be cast out something has happened he's become afraid he's become afraid enough to identify himself yes bunch of scared afraid doubting confused people a man who had denied the Lord and said I go a fishing and he' have went back to his old lifestyle if Jesus hadn't come in got him but you see this before his conversion this before he got the Holy Ghost are you with me now let me tell you the same the same now you know you know this will happen to you you you'll be you'll be a a lying cussing believer I Believe In Christ die to Christ the son of the Living God all right I believe I'm a Believer and you'll be a lying cussing Peter until you get your Pentecost and when you get your Pentecost that same guy who's fearful and Afraid amen becomes a spokesman in the upper room with the key to unlock it for all the rest of us repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ by remission of sin and you shall receive the Keys of the Kingdom the gift of the Holy Ghost cuz this promise is going to be for years your children and those that are far off even seven Church ages later even as many as the Lord Our God shall call and as long as he's still calling Mercy still Reigns and when the last one comes in the bride goes up so this same Mighty Angel is seen coming down in Acts chapter 2 as men who was scared afraid doubting confused but when the mighty Angel descended in a rushing Mighty Wind right out in the streets they went talking the Angel's language Hallelujah can you imagine that they went out talking the same language of the Angel come on it's time we quit talking doubts and fears and unbelief come under the power of the mighty Angel and start saying the same thing God [Applause] says the last pictures of the Bride is as manifested sons who under who are under the anointing and the power of the mighty Angel the final prophecy will be the bride's Voice who has eaten and digested the book and the word has become flesh in them and by doing that it positions and places them in the promised land of the Bible making them to prophesy again remember they overcame by the word of their testimony this is how we overcome by the word of our prophecy testifying of what the word said now eating the book requires maturity you see one who is the age of adoption who is fully able to digest the Deep things of God Amen now this positions them in a place of authority until they prophesy or become God's voice now the Mysteries are not revealed until there are a people on Earth who can digest them and manifest them now that's why there was milk and a little gr maybe that was added down to the ages but in this last day he talks about people who comes of full age Hebrews 5:3 everyone that use milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is the made and that's what we've had we've had people who have been unskillful Luther was unskillful in the word of righteousness he got the milk of justification amen but he you know he he laed a lot of things he was unskillful in the word of righteousness for example he didn't like the Jews right so therefore he brought a persecution upon the Jewish people and and because he didn't see them he was unskillful in the word of righteousness he didn't see them in their place and position as God's chosen people a physical people where we're a spiritual people he he was unskillful in the word of righteousness where he would still hold on to a trinity Doctrine he was unskillful in the word of righteousness where he still sprinkled instead of immersed we're talking about simple things but he enjoyed as a babe the milk of justification that's right right and so it has been all down to these ages maybe as I said a little more gr lay you know little GRL something like like feeding a baby you feed him milk but sometime mama will mix that milk with a with a a little bit of um meal or something you know that that she does she mixes together and she brings out something a little more substance as milk and it's getting ready to eat eat meat but it's not ready for meat I was brought little babies in my arms today that are are fat on the milk and healthy with what they have but they can't live on that all the rest of their life in order to to come to a maturity they're going to have to learn to eat other things and I want you to look at this until finally verse 14 says but strong meat strong meat belong to them that are of full age yes now we're talking about a mature church amen we're talking about mature Sons we're talking about sons who are being placed positioned and robed with authority but show meat belonging to them that are full age even who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil so these are men these are men of full age so if he gives the meat of the word he has to have a people that matches that word that can digest that word now you know some things are hard to take amen some things are hard to digest some things you need to chew on a long time it's part of the D digestion after while after all right you chew on it you get it there it's got to get down where the gastic ju juices are flowing and and there and consume the meat it belongs to them who are a full age so Revelation 108 he could not hand the book to Luther he was unskillful in the word of righteousness he was a milk Drinker on Hallelujah Wesley the same isusa street the same amen all of them are milk drinkers but you know what the age turns from man to an eagle and an eagle eats meat from [Music] birth amen you young people get the Holy Ghost and from your birth you are able to eat the meat of the word it's for you it's for our children it's for all of us come on church that ain't nothing too high nothing too great nothing too Wonders that you can't receive now brother brandham says about adoption he says now this may choke you to death so it's going to take a lot of chewing on it cuz strong meat requires chewing you know I went over to Africa many times I'd sit there with the African brothers and there they have you know their big white teeth shining out of those those beautiful black faces and here you can see great big strong teeth you know there I never saw one with braces on maybe they have to I don't know but anyway I've never seen them with a with a bunch of crooked stuff they were all strong them men they would we sit around the table and and uh he they'd say I like hard chicken and I'm an American I said I like salt chicken I said I like my chicken you know where I can pull it off the bone and eat it and swall it I don't like chicken that when I get a bite of it I go and it slaps me back in the face oh no brother Tim we love our chicken hard I said well you know hard chicken is chicken that's run out there and he's run himself until all his muscles are are just hard as a rock and that's the way they want him said we even eat the bum but you see that would choke us Americans to death but I want you to know there are men and women of this age that are a full age that can take strong meat Hallelujah and they can keep it down they can digest it if it's Holiness if is godliness amen whatever it is we can digest it we can keep it down and we can prophesy by the strength of it now brother brandham said this may choke you but did you know that men that are sons of God are amateur Gods what you're an amateur God M how many ever knew that how many knows that Jesus said so the Bible Jesus said did not your law say itself you are gods and if you call them God so let's go to John 10:34 where he's pulling this from and Jesus answered them is it not written in your law I said you are Gods well let me just stop for a minute if he said we're Gods we're Gods amen come on now let's go back to some simple genetics amen dogs bring forth dogs cats bring forth cats monkeys bring forth monkeys men bring forth other men or humans bring forth humans but when God reproduces what does he do he produces another Son of God did not isn't it written in your law in the word I said you're my children and if you're my children you're heirs and Joint HS while you are gods and as a God you have dominion as an adopted as a son adopted place you have dominion if you call them gods and to whom the word of God came and the scripture cannot be broken okay well brother Tim that was prophets yeah and the prophet the prophets did he called them Gods whom the word of God came to right prophets but you are also people to whom the word of God has come go take the book out of the hand of the Angel so did he not say you are gods and with that godship comes Dominion [Music] now if he called him Gods un to whom to whom the word of the L of God came to and we've receiv received God's word and the scripture cannot bre broken so if we're another people that has received the word then we also are Gods amen so then he said then say you of him whom the father has Sanctified and sent into the world thou BL blasphemist because I said I am the Son of God so you see they were saying he blasphemed because he called himself the Son of God and he said how can I blaspheme when God said that about me and what about you listen I know what the devil's been saying of you he's the accuser of your bre of the Brethren come on so he's there accusing you all the time but God said amen that you are Gods Hallelujah this is the Bible he said which in Genesis too that they were Gods because they had full domain with dominion over the world he gave him dominion over all things and he lost his godship sir he lost his sunship he lost his domain and Satan took it over but brother we are waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again Mama that's me can you see yourself in that promise amen we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top now you know what he's talking about it started off at the bottom there with the first church Ag and keeps on going up until we finally come to a place where there is a people that matches the Capstone coming down are you with me when the pyramid gets up to the top we're not at the bottom we're not in the middle we're at the top are there any other ages we've finished the ages we're here in the last days there are no more coming and we're in the last one that's right when fool Sons not milk drinkers come on fool sons of God will be manifested when the power of God will walk out Hallelujah and will take every Power that Satan's got away from him I'm talking about you the adoption AGS of people who will rise and take every Power that Satan has away from them well we might as well start now amen where where is that spirit of pornography where is that sex demon where where is that temper devil we might as well start at the bottom and work oursel all the way up the top cuz we're going to take every Power I am telling you this morning you do not have to live with defeat in your life you do not have to live subservient to sin you are an overcomer [Applause] and to the Overcomer I will grant to sit with me in my Throne oh brother Tim no we're mystery people you know we're you know we don't have any power we just got the Mysteries we got Revelation and that's greater than power you know that's greater than any of that well let me tell you foreal wait till them seven Thunders utter their voices to that group who can really take the word of God and hand it there it'll slice and cut and they can close the heavens they can shut this or do that whatever they want to Glory he will be slained by the word that proceeds from his mouth it is sharper than a two-edged sword they could call for 100 billion tons of flies if they wanted to amen whatever they say is going to happen because it's the word of God coming from the mouth of God hallelujah that's what seven Thunders do come on seven Thunders don't give you horn RM GL glasses and make you look like a nerd amen come on somebody doesn't it doesn't make you there some studious intellectual some idiots out there sorry I'm I'm getting a little bit maybe it's flesh amen but nevertheless it doesn't make you like that amen it makes you a Son of God with the authority of God hallelujah a voice that shake the devil that's what we're doing that's what we're called in this we're going to shake Satan's kingdom hallelujah we're going to shake him until he can't live in our young people till he can't live in our marriages till he has no place in our church till the till the devil will come and he says I find no place in them by our new birth we are born of the Supernatural we're born of the spoken word we're now eating from Christ from the Tree of Life the word of God think of that it all started out wrong in the beginning Eve eating from the wrong tree we have suffered from the results of that for six days of man 6,000 years but there's about a millennium about to Dawn we're in the changing of the season and the Winds of Change are blowing and the Holy Spirit is the one that's stiring it up and there's wars in the heaven and there's trouble on the earth and there's all kinds of calamities that you're seeing come everywhere around you but don't forget in the middle of all of that God's working and his wind is also blowing and that's why all the opposition is coming in this last day because God's word is going to be manifested in a people amen and there is a people now eating from Christ amen eating from the Tree of Life oh yeah 6,000 years ago we ate from the Tree of knowledge brought all the sin the shame the death the sorrow but now there's a people eating off the tree of life you believe Jesus taught that he said in John 6:54 whosoever eateth My Flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life now we know that's symbology of the word and the spirit he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood John 6:54 hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day they're going to be part of the Resurrection amen for my flesh is meat indeed my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him as a living father has sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me shall even live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat mana and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever Hallelujah but you know this Bread's only found in the holies of holies that's the only place where you can live forever John 14:20 at that day you shall know I in my father and you and me and I in you and that day you will know you e in the book you become one with the word cuz it's going to speak out of your life that's right every True Believer is the voice of God Jesus said would be did you know that Jesus said that Matthew 10:19 let me read it to you when they deliver you up when you are questioned take no thought about what you shall speak for it shall be given to you in the same hour what you shall speak for it is not you that speak but the spirit of your father which speaketh in you hallelujah we're talking about a people here in the last day that the spirit the Holy Ghost is speaking through that you don't even have to take a thought it lives automatically out of your life so the bride is The Voice or the Archangel for the Archangel is Christ and the voice of God is in her now let's be clear it is not don't don't think this carnally because it's not going to be a bunch of people out with a magic oneand waving this wand or screaming screaming a bunch of people running in the graveyards calling the dead it will be the atmosphere of Christ in his bride made so real until the blending of those atmospheres the dead come here look you see all around you the advancement of science you see autonomous cars right Rising on the scene you see great atomic nuclear bombs that are being built things they didn't even have knowledge or science for mysterious things that they have done things that's hard to even wrap your mind around of unseen things begin to twist in the Unseen of the atoms and and and and exploding there and causing destruction so it's a day is an hour where knowledge has increased men are running to and fro and knowledge has increased and all of these things like Daniel 12 and it's at that time that Michael stands up Hallelujah and right now when we need it the holy spirit is lifting a standard against the enemy and what is that standard and I saw another Mighty angel coming down from Heaven brother Brandon said the dead in Christ are out there waiting on you and me crying how long oh Lord how long do you know when he went beyond the curtain they wanted to come back to the Earth yeah so one day we'll come they were looking eagerly with one day returning back and picking up their bodies amen they were looking about they were looking forward to unite with the living and finally being united together with Christ and he said those under the altar the under the grave under the altar of God are crying how long Lord how long how much longer God is waiting on you and me the church is waiting on you and me adoption time when God can p pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection and becomes so close till Christ becomes visible Among Us and raises the Dead and we go in the Rapture so we're moving into a sphere I'm going to break into this part then we're going to close because I've run out of time he says I believe the Church of the Living God is moving into a sphere yeah now that's going to shake the whole world oh you you might think oh but there's not going to be no Revival he didn't say divide the whole world that's he said shake the whole world when this bride leaves from here the whole world is going to shake amen Satan will come down trouble is times like never before do you know you are one you men and women you little ladies there with that little little bun on the back and you go into public and they make fun of that and looks like a wheel tied up in the back and you know all the funny things they want to say them them uh funny looking people with long dresses and whatever do you realize you are the ones holding the wrath of God off the Earth do you realize that you're preaching a message as they come up there with their Manish haircuts and their painted faces and their Sodom look you are exemplifying the very word of the Bible testify preaching a sermon by the life you live you men with your clean cut with your work ethics with your honesty that makes a good name are you with me good name is worth more than riches amen you see the prophet of God said it isn't the Harlot The Prostitute the drunker out there that brings a bad name on the church is when you Christians live like that calling yourself a Believer that's what brings a bad name on the church that's right but you are going out before the world testifying that there is a resurrection power that has taken you out of sin made a son and daughter of God out of you and you're exemplifying Christ in your life so he says you're going to shake the whole world and he speaks of speaking squirrels into existence that's the first time it's been since the days of Jesus of Nazareth to a human being ask anything that you will and it shall be given unto you anything you desire don't you see the words of Jesus Christ being fulfilled oh it's going to come to pass pretty soon I'm looking for it to happen in this meeting I'm want it to happen now that that anointing was like the church the whole Church of the Living God and she'll rise to her feet like a mighty marching Army the sick will be healed by word the blind will see the death will hear the dead it will be raised up and the power of God will shake the world with the Church of the Living God we're in the process of it now I believe it's soon coming to pass I will believe it will be just exactly that way I believe it's going to start the Church of God soon and it's going to start Revival that'll be in that right a Revival that will shake the world I believe it and that's the kind of atmosphere we're going to meet the Lord in for we will meet him in the air we shall all rise to meet him bl's stand we shall all go to greet him and that morning when the dead in Christ arise what a day that will be amen what an hour to look for and realize you are the people of the adoption age you are the people that have been called in this day the mature ones to eat the book and then testify You Are Not Alone Little Children You are under the anointing and power of the mighty Angel Hallelujah amen as it as the musicians come and the song is getting ready here and we're trying to close now I want Jesus to think there 2,000 years ago when that mighty one came down from heaven and there he came in the upper room and people got intoxicated with the spirit until they were drunk so drunk on him on that new wine they come out staggering amen from the upper room and they were there drunk empowered until they would walk out on the street and say Silver and Gold Have I done but I have something I have a position and an authority whereby I can actually call Heaven down and make Satan give up that body amen the one who contended with the body of Moses is here in our midst to contend for your body today if you need saving he's the Savior if he needs you need healing he's the Healer he's the Holy Ghost filler he's the need supplier amen amen thank you Lord thank you Lord oh Jesus thank you [Music] Lord do you believe it this [Music] morning are you ready to to turn down the LIE of the devil that's been talking in your ear and saying you can't when the Holy Spirit is Whispering to you you can I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me my body is not yours Satan my body belongs to [Music] God I'm a child of the king the adoption age where Sons and Daughters of God coming to maternity a people who can eat that word digest it until he comes out of their life [Music] [Music] speaking people who become the voice of the Resurrection a people who meet him in that air that air that's been cleared of every demon power where he descends as as brother Bram said where Redemption has expanded it to redeem us we're
