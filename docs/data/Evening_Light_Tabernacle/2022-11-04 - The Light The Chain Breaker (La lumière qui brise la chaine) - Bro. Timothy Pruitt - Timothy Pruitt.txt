saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day it is also Micah chapter 2 and verse 12. says I will surely a symbol o Jacob all of thee and I will surely gather the remnant of Israel I will put them together as a sheep of Basra as the flock in the midst of their fold and they shall make great Noise by the reason of the multitude of men foreign the breaker is come up before them and they have broken up and have passed through the gate and are gone out by it and their King shall pass before them and the Lord on the head of them is foreign as we read here the Bible says that the world was without form and recorded there was nothing but dark just a darkness of chaos what a horrible shape it must have been nothing but Darkness maybe the Turning of water it was out of its orbit it was something that was lost and couldn't find its way brother Brandon says that's what we are when we are we're once wandering Stars away from God out in darkness not knowing but God took that great chaos of darkness and it transformed it into it how did he do

they have broken out and have passed through the gate and their King is at the head or the Lord is at the house Jesus has gone before us the road you walk today so if he has gone before us things don't remain as though they would have if he'd never wish but he has conquered everything not only has he traveled the same road he has nailed it to the Cross he has been the death of death he has
