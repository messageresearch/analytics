[39:21] that you're changed in his presence
[39:24] let's just go to him in prayer gracious
[39:26] eternal father
[39:27] what a great honor to know lord tonight
[39:29] that our lives have been touched
[39:31] by the author and the finisher of our
[39:33] faith the one who formed the world's
[39:35] lord you're the one who formed and
[39:37] fashioned us dear god
[39:38] and tonight we can truly say we've been
[39:41] changed
[39:42] not by anything that we merited on our
[39:44] own abilities and human efforts
[39:46] but because lord we stepped into your
[39:48] presence and your presence changed us
[39:51] lord we're not what we used to be lord
[39:53] we're maybe not what we
[39:54] desire to be but father it's you
[39:57] continually working on the behalf of the
[39:58] believer lord to bring him
[40:00] into the state in the place in which you
[40:02] desire us to be
[40:04] father so we thank you tonight lord we
[40:06] just pray that you'll bless this service
[40:08] we ask god that you'll just have free
[40:09] course in our way tonight
[40:11] lord we just worship you in spirit and
[40:13] in truth we invite you lord tonight
[40:15] in this service to be the guest minister
[40:17] father lord we're not here to look in on
[40:20] the efforts of a man
[40:21] but we're here to look to the son of man
[40:23] now may you speak
[40:24] boldly to us father and on our ears not
[40:27] in our hearts
[40:28] lord and anoint us just to be able to
[40:29] receive from the word tonight
[40:31] for we ask it in jesus name amen and
[40:34] amen if you have your bibles we're going
[40:35] to look here in luke
[40:37] chapter 8 and verse 1. it's good to be
[40:39] back with you we were
[40:41] joseph and i went on a little if you
[40:43] want to call a little mini vacation we
[40:45] met brother andrew glover in missouri
[40:47] and
[40:50] tip and enjoying each other's company
[40:52] and doing a little turkey hunting while
[40:54] we were there
[40:55] it was a good time but it's always good
[40:57] to be back home with god's people
[40:59] good to be back home with those that
[41:00] love you and i trust tonight that
[41:02] that you love me because i love you as
[41:04] well and glad
[41:06] to be a part of this assembly to be a
[41:07] part of what god is doing here leave me
[41:10] like tabernacle
[41:11] so we're going to look here tonight and
[41:13] we're going to pick back up on the theme
[41:15] that i've been on god does impossible
[41:17] math and as we saw
[41:18] god move on behalf of our activity
[41:20] building god doing the impossible
[41:23] brother daryl can tell you a little bit
[41:24] more about the situation but god
[41:26] definitely moved on behalf of that
[41:27] that uh fire marshal and changed his
[41:30] countenance and his disposition toward
[41:32] us and our church and
[41:33] we found favor because we're favored by
[41:35] god
[41:36] and everything that we say and do i
[41:37] believe that we should look for the
[41:39] favor of god and
[41:40] god has uh turned his attention toward
[41:43] us we look here tonight in luke 8
[41:45] and it came to pass afterward that he
[41:47] went throughout every
[41:49] every city and village preaching and
[41:51] showing the glad tidings of the kingdom
[41:53] of god
[41:54] and the twelve were with him and a
[41:57] certain woman which had been healed of
[41:59] evil spirits
[42:00] and infirmities mary called magdalene
[42:03] out of whom went
[42:04] seven devils you can have your seats
[42:06] tonight we're gonna look here at another
[42:07] scripture here in just a few minutes
[42:09] but we see here that jesus is going out
[42:12] preaching
[42:13] the good news the glad tidings of the
[42:14] kingdom of god and the twelve disciples
[42:16] were with him
[42:17] and one called mary whom he cast out
[42:20] seven devils
[42:21] now if we would have lived in that day
[42:23] the day of mary magdalene we would have
[42:25] considered her a lost cause a hopeless
[42:27] case
[42:28] no doubt she'd have looked at herself
[42:30] and said i'm a prostitute i'm a woman of
[42:32] ill
[42:32] fame it's impossible for me to be
[42:34] delivered you know i looked over my life
[42:36] and i'm just a useless
[42:38] piece of humanity to this society i
[42:41] contribute
[42:42] nothing but what we find is what may be
[42:46] impossible with man is never impossible
[42:48] with god
[42:50] you can look upon the countenance of man
[42:52] the most degraded man
[42:54] out there as we find in legion and the
[42:57] maniac of godaria
[42:58] we find these men we would have never
[43:00] gave two ounces or two seconds
[43:03] of attention but yet god will cross a
[43:05] raging sea
[43:07] because he sees something that you and i
[43:09] can't see
[43:10] so we find what's impossible when man is
[43:13] not impossible with god
[43:15] so tonight we're going to speak again on
[43:17] god does impossible math
[43:20] and your past doesn't have you
[43:23] your past doesn't have you we finally
[43:25] hear in second corinthians 5 17
[43:27] therefore if any man be in christ he's a
[43:29] new creature
[43:30] old things are passed away i believe
[43:33] every believer in here tonight should
[43:35] rejoice on that all things all the old
[43:37] things are passed away
[43:38] that's not who i am anymore
[43:41] behold all things have become new or are
[43:44] become new
[43:45] and all things are of god who has
[43:47] reconciled us to himself by jesus christ
[43:50] and has given us given to us the
[43:52] ministry of reconciliation
[43:54] but we find mary was or mary was from
[43:56] the city
[43:57] of magdala and this city was known for
[44:00] prostitution
[44:02] so she was already marred because of
[44:04] where she was located
[44:05] and anywhere she went the stigma of
[44:07] prostitution
[44:08] of ill fame went with her so no matter
[44:12] what her past went with her
[44:14] every day that she lived it was always
[44:16] followed her
[44:17] but the prophet god would tell us in the
[44:18] message unwelcome christ
[44:20] remember somebody introduced her to that
[44:23] life
[44:24] before there can be a foul woman that
[44:26] has to be a foul man that's right
[44:28] maybe some boy fell in love with her
[44:34] be careful young girl some whirly boy
[44:37] wants to come and sweep you off your
[44:38] feet and tell you all these nice things
[44:40] about you and
[44:41] he's got a motive he's got an objective
[44:46] because he's unconverted and he sees
[44:48] something in you with that surprise in
[44:50] his eyes
[44:51] and this same young boy saw mary before
[44:54] she was
[44:55] tainted by the relationship and he maybe
[44:58] had her fall in love with him and he
[45:00] enticed her
[45:01] and brother brennan would say he made
[45:02] her promises and he ruined
[45:04] her life and he introduced her to such
[45:08] and then pushed her off to one side to
[45:10] run off to some other woman
[45:12] he said some sweetheart introduced us
[45:14] such a life put her in his arms
[45:16] and he promised her everything no you
[45:19] promised her i'm going to love you i'm
[45:20] going to be faithful
[45:21] if you just do this act and prove to me
[45:23] that you love me
[45:25] because that's a lot of times how that
[45:28] relationship goes
[45:29] if you really loved me you would do this
[45:32] if you really loved me you would kiss me
[45:34] or you really loved me you would
[45:35] go further and go further and go it
[45:37] never stops
[45:38] until she becomes a woman of ill fame
[45:42] until she mars her testimony until
[45:46] the prophet of god will say her
[45:47] character is ruined and he runs away to
[45:50] spoil another
[45:51] and now she's roaming the streets making
[45:53] money the best
[45:54] way that she can see like the prodigal
[45:58] son
[45:58] instead of running back to the father's
[46:00] house she runs further into the country
[46:02] she goes further off into sin to her now
[46:06] her life her livelihood
[46:07] is prostitution this one act between her
[46:11] and this sweetheart opened the door to a
[46:13] lifestyle
[46:14] of prostitution opened her up to spirits
[46:18] for not only one spirit that she had but
[46:21] she was bound by
[46:22] seven evil spirits
[46:25] but this same woman we find her in john
[46:28] 8
[46:29] in verse 3 and the scribes and the
[46:32] pharisees brought unto him a woman taken
[46:34] in adultery
[46:35] now the historians will tie mary
[46:38] magdalene to this same
[46:39] chapter into the same scripture and say
[46:42] that mary magdalene is this woman here
[46:44] and
[46:45] she was caught in the very act of
[46:47] adultery and when they had saturn in the
[46:49] midst they say until master
[46:51] this woman was taken in adultery in the
[46:54] very act
[46:56] now moses in the law he commanded us
[46:59] that such should be certain notice
[47:01] their first instinct was to stone her
[47:04] and you find many times that those that
[47:06] have things in their life
[47:08] those that have sin in their life they
[47:10] carry stones in their pockets
[47:11] because if they can throw stones and it
[47:13] takes the attention off of their flaws
[47:15] and their character traits
[47:17] but you find those that don't have any
[47:19] stones and they've been recipients of
[47:21] god's grace
[47:22] and god's mercy they're not their
[47:24] casting stones but they're there
[47:26] pronouncing
[47:27] mercy and grace to them there's a way
[47:29] you don't have to live that way anymore
[47:31] there's a god in heaven he can save you
[47:33] and deliver you
[47:34] but you find those that have things in
[47:36] their heart and things
[47:38] in their life they're costly throwing
[47:39] stones
[47:41] at those that are bound by sin
[47:45] just to deflect to deflect it from their
[47:49] self
[47:51] he says now moses in the law commanders
[47:53] so shall be stoned but what saith thou
[47:55] this they said tempting him that they
[47:57] might have to accuse him but jesus
[47:59] stooped down and with his finger he
[48:00] wrote on the ground
[48:01] as though he heard them not so when they
[48:03] continued asking him he lifted up
[48:05] himself and he said unto them
[48:07] he that is without sin among you let him
[48:10] cast the first stone
[48:13] and again he stooped down he wrote on
[48:14] the ground and they which heard it being
[48:16] convicted by their own conscious notice
[48:18] they knew that they had sin in their
[48:19] life they knew that they were not
[48:22] perfect
[48:23] and if we come to this church every day
[48:25] and we wake up every morning and realize
[48:27] we're not perfect we need the blood we
[48:29] need the blood each and every day we
[48:30] need a token
[48:31] we need god each and every day we won't
[48:33] be picking up stones to throw in our
[48:35] neighbor
[48:36] to throw at our brother to throw at some
[48:37] other church no we'll be picking up
[48:39] grace and mercy
[48:41] and saying god have mercy on them god
[48:43] open their eyes let them see what we see
[48:45] let them experience
[48:46] what we experienced and when jesus
[48:49] looked it up himself he saw none but the
[48:51] moment in verse 10
[48:52] and he says unto her woman where are
[48:54] those dying accusers
[48:56] has no man condemned thee she said no
[48:58] man lord
[48:59] and jesus said unto her neither do i
[49:01] condemn thee
[49:02] go and sin no more now trust
[49:05] many of you here tonight have heard
[49:07] those same words
[49:09] because as much as you think you're
[49:11] saintly and godly and
[49:13] you cut your teeth on a message pew yet
[49:16] you were born in sin
[49:17] shaped in iniquity you needed this same
[49:20] jesus
[49:22] you needed the same encounter
[49:26] neither do i condemn thee go and sin no
[49:28] more notice this encounter with jesus
[49:30] began to change her life
[49:33] he began her on the road to a new life
[49:36] before this meeting she probably went to
[49:37] every synagogue
[49:39] looking for help for the cure looking
[49:41] for somebody that can deliver her
[49:43] and cast these seven devils off of her
[49:46] looking for some way of an escape to
[49:48] rehab her life
[49:49] so that she wouldn't continue the life
[49:51] of prostitution
[49:52] and bound by this and bound by that she
[49:54] was longing for
[49:56] deliverance but she couldn't find it
[49:59] until she came to the feet of jesus
[50:03] because he's the only one church you're
[50:04] not going to find it in a man
[50:07] you're not going to find it in your
[50:08] favorite preacher but you'll find it in
[50:10] christ
[50:11] you'll find what you're looking for in
[50:14] christ
[50:15] and i say that to say take your eyes off
[50:17] a man take your eyes off of humanity
[50:19] because man will fail you but christ
[50:21] will never fail you
[50:22] man will disappoint you but the blood
[50:24] will never disappoint you
[50:27] she stood here and where she once heard
[50:29] about his love
[50:30] where she was told about his grace and
[50:32] mercy now this jesus the messiah
[50:35] had extended to her his love
[50:38] now he has extended to her his grace and
[50:41] his mercy
[50:42] now she was a recipient she become a
[50:45] recipient
[50:46] of life-changing power where she walked
[50:49] in his presence
[50:50] a bound prostitute she walked in maybe
[50:53] bound by demons of lust
[50:54] and depression and suicide and this that
[50:57] and she walked in one way
[50:59] but she walked out another way and the
[51:01] difference was jesus christ
[51:02] the difference was the encounter that
[51:04] she had was the one that can erase her
[51:06] past
[51:07] and i trust tonight that you've come
[51:09] into that same encounter
[51:10] where you met jesus you didn't meet a
[51:12] man you didn't mean a theology you
[51:14] didn't mean a doctrine
[51:16] but you met the life of christ and that
[51:18] life changed who you are
[51:22] we find her again in luke 7.
[51:26] and i love how the scriptures how it
[51:28] puts it all in past
[51:30] tense
[51:33] not future tense not present tense past
[51:36] tense
[51:38] we find here in luke 7 and verse 37 and
[51:41] behold a woman in the city
[51:44] which was nadia's
[51:48] she was a prostitute or a sinner that
[51:51] word center there means prostitute
[51:54] when she knew that jesus said at meeting
[51:56] the pharisee's house
[51:59] she went on home she didn't think about
[52:01] it anymore she felt like well he's in
[52:02] good hands
[52:03] he's eating a nice meal he's in good
[52:05] company i'm just going to go chill out
[52:07] at the house
[52:08] no when she knew that he was there
[52:13] she brought an alabaster box of ointment
[52:16] and she stood
[52:16] at his feet behind him weeping
[52:20] because she realized the person that she
[52:22] was
[52:23] she realized the spirits that once held
[52:27] her bound
[52:28] and she was weeping because now she was
[52:31] no longer bound
[52:32] by those things and she began to wash
[52:35] his feet with her tears
[52:37] and she did wipe them with the hairs of
[52:38] her head and kissed him
[52:40] and kissed his feet and anointed them
[52:42] with ointment
[52:44] notice here she stands a ruined life
[52:48] here she stands every day she was bound
[52:50] by depression and oppression
[52:53] fear gripped her life she felt like she
[52:55] had her life had no
[52:56] value at all to society every day
[52:59] thoughts of suicide race through her
[53:01] mind
[53:02] i might as well give up i might as well
[53:04] end it because this is all i'll ever be
[53:07] but god sees more in you than what you
[53:09] see in yourself
[53:11] you wake up in the morning you look in
[53:13] that mirror and you see your flaws you
[53:14] see your past
[53:15] you see your mistakes but god sees his
[53:18] perfection
[53:20] god sees that image that he took of you
[53:22] before the foundation of the world
[53:24] and he says i'm going to allow this to
[53:26] happen and this to happen and to chip
[53:28] away at this and to chip away at that
[53:30] to mold you to do what to produce the
[53:32] negative
[53:34] so that it'll develop you into what he's
[53:36] already seen you to be
[53:38] so we find here in verse 39 7 39 now
[53:42] when the pharisee which had bidding him
[53:43] saw it
[53:44] he spake within himself saying this man
[53:48] if he were a prophet would have known
[53:50] who and what man or woman this
[53:52] is that touched him for she's a sinner
[53:56] and jesus answered and said unto him
[53:57] simon i have somewhat to say unto thee
[54:00] and he said master say on he said there
[54:02] was a certain creditor which had two
[54:04] debtors
[54:05] one owed them 500 pence and the other
[54:07] owed them 50.
[54:09] and when they had nothing to pay he
[54:10] frankly forgave them both tell me
[54:12] therefore
[54:13] which one of them would love him the
[54:15] most
[54:16] i'm afraid that we have a lot of 50 50s
[54:18] in this
[54:20] message we have a lot of 50s they don't
[54:24] think that he's worth worshipping
[54:29] they're not in love with him enough to
[54:31] truly give
[54:32] all their worship then you have some in
[54:36] this message
[54:37] that are 500 and they don't care what
[54:40] you think about them
[54:42] because they were forgiven the most and
[54:45] i trusted even like tabernacle never
[54:47] never harbors the 50s never let it come
[54:51] complacent
[54:52] never let the movement of the spirit die
[54:54] never sit back on our law
[54:56] sit on our hands and quench the spirit
[54:58] but may we open ourselves up and realize
[55:00] we have so much to be thankful for he's
[55:02] forgiven us
[55:03] of so much
[55:06] simon answered and said i suppose to him
[55:08] that forgave the most and he said unto
[55:09] him thou has rightly judged
[55:11] and he turned to the woman and he said
[55:13] unto simon seeth thou this woman
[55:15] i had entered into thy house thou gave
[55:16] us me no water from my feet
[55:18] but she has washed my feet with her
[55:20] tears and wiped them with her head
[55:21] thou gave us me no kiss but this woman
[55:23] since the time that i came
[55:24] has not ceased to kiss my feet my head
[55:27] with all this thou
[55:28] not anoint but this woman has anointed
[55:30] my feet with ointment
[55:31] wherefore i say unto her sins which are
[55:33] many are forgiven
[55:35] for she loved much but to whom little
[55:38] is forgiven the same loveth little
[55:43] and he looks at her and he says to her
[55:45] thy sins
[55:47] are forgiven
[55:51] so we found the eastern custom was the
[55:54] foot washing
[55:55] it was an act of hospitality and yet
[55:58] simon invited
[55:59] jesus into his home and he didn't even
[56:02] make him welcome brother mike
[56:05] the kiss was a token of affection and
[56:07] salutation
[56:08] simon invited him into his home and
[56:10] neglected to kiss him on his cheek
[56:12] but this woman bowed herself in humility
[56:15] and cease not to kiss his feet
[56:18] we find that he didn't even know on his
[56:20] head with oil and yet she went and got a
[56:22] costly
[56:24] bottle of perfume where once
[56:28] she would put it on her body to make
[56:29] herself attractive and luring
[56:31] to other men now she was pouring it out
[56:34] on his feet
[56:35] to give him the attention give him the
[56:37] attraction
[56:38] to anoint him so that he's the one
[56:41] that's received
[56:42] and not herself brother branham would
[56:45] tell us like this
[56:46] and washing jesus feet she looked like
[56:48] she was out of her head
[56:52] you know we've had some church services
[56:54] where it looks like even light
[56:55] has fallen off the rocker
[56:58] you got young people up laughing in the
[57:01] spirit running the aisles and
[57:03] old people running well some of them
[57:05] running the aisles and
[57:06] you got people shouting all over the
[57:08] place you got the moving on
[57:09] it looks like we're completely lost that
[57:12] we're out of our heads
[57:14] but brother baby say she was at the feet
[57:17] of jesus
[57:19] and when you recognize who comes to this
[57:21] service wednesdays and sunday service
[57:23] after service
[57:25] oh and you realize you got an
[57:26] opportunity to be at his feet
[57:28] you've got an opportunity to worship the
[57:30] king of kings
[57:31] and the lord of lords let me tell you
[57:33] you'll put your stones away
[57:35] and you'll come up and say lord i'm here
[57:37] in this service i'm going to push
[57:38] through in this service i want to get to
[57:40] you in this earth and i'm going to wash
[57:42] your feet lord
[57:43] i want to kiss you lord and make love to
[57:45] you in the sanctuary
[57:46] because you've done so much for me
[57:48] father
[57:51] notice people may act like they're crazy
[57:53] but what difference does it make as long
[57:54] as you're at the feet of jesus
[57:57] what do i care what they think she was
[57:59] at jesus's feet
[58:01] but this pharisee was ready to blow up
[58:06] now here he was he was a critic he was
[58:08] beside himself because of what
[58:10] she was doing and how she was acting
[58:14] what is this prostitute doing in my
[58:16] house first of all
[58:19] why in the world she bowed down to this
[58:21] man who they're claiming he's the
[58:23] messiah
[58:24] and look at her washing his feet with
[58:26] her tears
[58:27] and wiping them with her hair how
[58:30] disgusting
[58:31] doesn't she know she's going to have all
[58:33] the filth of the world
[58:34] all tangled up in her hair she didn't
[58:37] care church
[58:39] and until we get to that place where we
[58:40] don't care what the critics say
[58:43] we don't care what the critics claim
[58:45] they can claim what they won't notice
[58:48] see the problem today is there's so many
[58:50] critics and they criticize the movement
[58:52] of the spirit
[58:54] they feel that we shouldn't act this way
[58:56] in church
[58:58] simon felt like she didn't need to act
[58:59] that way in his church
[59:01] but she did it anyway because she
[59:04] recognized the one that freed her from
[59:06] seven spirits
[59:07] the one that changed her life from a
[59:08] life of prostitution
[59:10] and made a daughter a god out of her he
[59:12] was out there pushed in the corner
[59:13] wasn't made welcome and she came to the
[59:16] surface
[59:17] she came to church that day to the feast
[59:19] and says
[59:20] i'm here to make love to you lord i'm
[59:22] here to make you welcome in this service
[59:23] on a wednesday night when there ain't
[59:25] nobody there
[59:26] i'm here i came tonight to love your god
[59:29] and to make you welcome i'm here to give
[59:31] you praise tonight i'm going to worship
[59:33] the king of kings
[59:35] the one that i walked in one way down
[59:37] and i walked out another way a free
[59:39] woman
[59:41] oh hallelujah
[59:44] see we find people today though they
[59:45] want to say well
[59:47] even like tabernacle you shouldn't act
[59:49] that way
[59:52] my generation didn't act like that
[59:56] i got a news flash dead
[1:00:00] dead generation is dead
[1:00:04] but this generation has got life
[1:00:08] this generation is flexible this
[1:00:11] generation can move with the movement of
[1:00:13] the spirit of
[1:00:14] god see the pharisee he criticized a
[1:00:18] woman
[1:00:19] and he criticized jesus but he didn't
[1:00:22] realize
[1:00:23] that he was presented with the same
[1:00:26] opportunity
[1:00:28] to do what she was doing he was
[1:00:31] presented he
[1:00:32] invited him to his house
[1:00:36] he had an opportunity brother mike to
[1:00:39] surrender his heart
[1:00:41] to give up his clerical ideas and
[1:00:43] theology
[1:00:46] the one that he had studied and learned
[1:00:47] about all these years was now
[1:00:49] standing face to face but he was pushed
[1:00:52] over in a corner
[1:00:54] may we never be guilty of pushing jesus
[1:00:57] in a corner
[1:00:58] and letting somebody else worship
[1:01:01] letting somebody else
[1:01:02] carry the burden to worship of him and
[1:01:05] making him welcome like simon
[1:01:06] let her do all the work
[1:01:10] see in his mind he was too big for that
[1:01:13] in his mind he thought he was somebody
[1:01:16] he was too prideful
[1:01:17] to wash jesus's feet he was too proper
[1:01:21] to come to an altar on a wednesday night
[1:01:23] because he's worried about what is
[1:01:24] everybody else going to think about
[1:01:26] see the difference was that this
[1:01:29] pharisee
[1:01:30] was not married he hasn't been bound
[1:01:34] the way that she had been bowed she was
[1:01:37] bound with seven devils she was bound
[1:01:38] with a life of prostitution
[1:01:40] and she was longing for deliverance she
[1:01:42] knew that she was a vile person
[1:01:45] and he didn't realize he was as well
[1:01:48] see the pharisee didn't realize that he
[1:01:50] was worse off than her
[1:01:52] therefore he criticized her for her
[1:01:54] actions and we have been criticized
[1:01:56] and criticized and criticized for our
[1:01:59] worship
[1:02:02] i believe it was paul to say the way
[1:02:03] that they call heresy
[1:02:05] so worship i the lord amen
[1:02:10] the way that they call let them call it
[1:02:11] whatever they want
[1:02:14] they're only looking in through the eyes
[1:02:15] of a camera we're here feeling the power
[1:02:18] in the anointing of the holy spirit
[1:02:21] moving through the building
[1:02:24] if you can feel on the camera what we
[1:02:26] feel in here you wouldn't be saying the
[1:02:28] things that you're saying
[1:02:29] because you would begin to experience
[1:02:31] the life
[1:02:32] the power the manifestation of the holy
[1:02:34] spirit but as long as you're hit behind
[1:02:36] the eyes of the camera
[1:02:37] and on the live stream all you see is a
[1:02:40] bunch of emotion or what appears to be a
[1:02:42] bunch of emotion
[1:02:43] and yes it's easy to criticize
[1:02:48] but see maybe some of those out there
[1:02:49] that want to do the criticizing
[1:02:53] they've not been where you and i have
[1:02:54] been
[1:02:56] some of those may not had a death
[1:02:57] sentence pronounced on them and may be
[1:02:59] given just a few years to live
[1:03:01] because they got stage four
[1:03:02] non-hodgkin's lymphoma
[1:03:04] and have a family to look after oh but
[1:03:07] when the power of god drops down in the
[1:03:09] service and that revelation strikes that
[1:03:11] heart
[1:03:11] that i don't have cancer any longer that
[1:03:13] i've been set free
[1:03:14] it'll take a young lady up out of her
[1:03:16] chair out of repute
[1:03:18] and run around the church why because
[1:03:20] the revelation has struck
[1:03:22] let me tell you you wouldn't criticize
[1:03:23] if you was in those shoes
[1:03:26] you wouldn't criticize if you had
[1:03:27] another brain bleed or midline shift and
[1:03:30] the doctors gave you five minutes
[1:03:31] and you experience the healing power of
[1:03:34] almighty god you
[1:03:35] ain't criticized anymore you'll worship
[1:03:37] god and thank god for what he's done
[1:03:45] maybe you maybe if you would ever been
[1:03:48] delivered
[1:03:50] of that suicidal spirit that's tormented
[1:03:53] into many of them messes believers
[1:03:56] torment to many of our young people and
[1:03:58] when those spirits are cast off
[1:04:01] and as we seen the other night the heart
[1:04:03] of god began to dance and sin in the
[1:04:05] spirit of god
[1:04:06] because while the chains that held her
[1:04:08] bound were no longer elder anymore
[1:04:11] the past that held her in bondage no
[1:04:13] longer had a hold anymore let me tell
[1:04:15] you
[1:04:15] we have a reason to worship
[1:04:20] we find now jesus got his feet and she's
[1:04:24] at his feet
[1:04:24] he didn't pull back the prophet god says
[1:04:26] he didn't pull his feet back as hell
[1:04:28] don't do that don't cause a scene on a
[1:04:30] wednesday night
[1:04:33] no he sat there and he watched her he
[1:04:36] allowed
[1:04:37] this dirty woman a real fame
[1:04:41] to touch him to worship him
[1:04:45] to make love to him and don't think that
[1:04:48] as a
[1:04:48] negative at all but if he was the been
[1:04:52] where she was at
[1:04:55] he'd be offering that same kind of love
[1:04:56] tonight he'd be offered that same kind
[1:04:59] of sacrifice of praise tonight
[1:05:02] see jesus don't he doesn't pull back he
[1:05:05] doesn't do things that way no sir
[1:05:06] he never pulled his foot back he sat
[1:05:09] right still
[1:05:10] and he washed her notice what the
[1:05:12] prophet of god says
[1:05:13] she was doing for him what they ought to
[1:05:16] have done
[1:05:18] she was doing for him what they ought to
[1:05:21] have done
[1:05:23] then he begins to say sin and you be
[1:05:25] careful calling somebody
[1:05:27] a holy roller who's doing what you ought
[1:05:29] to have done
[1:05:30] don't you think you're a little better
[1:05:32] than they are let me just go ahead and
[1:05:33] give the critics notice
[1:05:34] don't you be careful who you're calling
[1:05:36] holy rollers because what we're doing
[1:05:38] and even like tabernacle
[1:05:40] is what you should be doing in your
[1:05:41] church it's what you should be doing in
[1:05:44] your home
[1:05:44] it's what you should be doing in your
[1:05:46] experience with jesus
[1:05:48] is to worship him he deserves our
[1:05:50] worship
[1:05:51] but all we do is we're throwing stones
[1:05:53] and criticizing
[1:05:54] because there ain't no life in your
[1:05:55] church we'll invite jesus
[1:05:57] and make him welcome and you'll see life
[1:05:59] come back to the assembly
[1:06:04] he says that these big starches won't
[1:06:05] worship god god will pull out you poor
[1:06:07] people
[1:06:09] he will get you to do it somebody he
[1:06:11] will call sinners and harlots
[1:06:13] from the street to do it somebody is
[1:06:15] going to worship god
[1:06:18] i raise my hand tonight lord i'm that
[1:06:20] somebody
[1:06:22] god i don't care what the critics say
[1:06:24] let them say what they want to joe adam
[1:06:26] this is a fanatic
[1:06:27] absolutely a fanatic i used to dance in
[1:06:29] the comfort for the devil i'll dance in
[1:06:31] the church
[1:06:32] for jesus i don't care what you say
[1:06:34] about me i don't care what it looks like
[1:06:36] i may be out of my head i may lost my
[1:06:38] mind but i got the mind of jesus
[1:06:40] i got the love of jesus i know what he's
[1:06:43] done for me
[1:06:48] brother andrew glover shared this quote
[1:06:49] from me on the way to church tonight
[1:06:52] he says brother joe i think you need
[1:06:53] this i said i'll look it over
[1:06:57] i text him back after it i said i'm
[1:06:59] going to use it
[1:07:01] he says what we need is to get down to
[1:07:03] that grinding place
[1:07:05] down there in the valley and dig out
[1:07:09] how much gotta do a little bit of work
[1:07:11] when where is he not
[1:07:13] well maybe they ain't all full and
[1:07:14] packed out we do a little digging
[1:07:17] tonight can't we brother aaron
[1:07:18] dig down a little bit let's let's get
[1:07:19] the comwells off of us tonight
[1:07:21] we're here to worship see it's where the
[1:07:25] church needs to be tonight
[1:07:27] he says now i can imagine they were
[1:07:28] noticing the green light
[1:07:30] beginning you know you say green he said
[1:07:31] yeah he goes we might be green
[1:07:34] but we got life anyhow
[1:07:38] see they don't think brother branham was
[1:07:40] pentecostal they think he was some stiff
[1:07:43] neck starchy
[1:07:44] preacher no they don't know the same
[1:07:46] prophet that i know
[1:07:48] he says i was in a school not long ago
[1:07:50] my son told some students that he was
[1:07:53] from southwestern bible school myself
[1:07:56] and they said well if you can read and
[1:07:57] write you're better off than that bunch
[1:07:59] over there
[1:08:00] i said well he says they're the greenest
[1:08:02] bunch we've ever seen
[1:08:04] brother man says oh brother we might be
[1:08:06] green
[1:08:07] but we're flexible
[1:08:12] oh i don't know if even like caught that
[1:08:13] one we might be green
[1:08:15] but we're flexible anything that isn't
[1:08:19] green when you pull a little bit
[1:08:20] you'll break it he says oh that's what's
[1:08:22] the matter today with too many people's
[1:08:24] experiences
[1:08:25] too dry and too stiff we need something
[1:08:28] flexible
[1:08:29] so when the wind comes down and it can
[1:08:31] blow it and rush around and pull it
[1:08:33] around and make it grow
[1:08:34] get life in it i'd rather be green a
[1:08:37] little green and to be flexible to the
[1:08:38] holy ghost so i can give instead of
[1:08:41] standing
[1:08:41] and making unmournful noise
[1:08:46] it's like a funeral service
[1:08:49] the days of miracles has passed god
[1:08:51] don't do that anymore
[1:08:52] in my generation we didn't act like that
[1:08:55] i think you should just be
[1:08:56] calm and you know you need to have some
[1:08:58] church order even like tabernacle
[1:09:00] okay we got it we're green we're
[1:09:03] flexible
[1:09:05] we don't quench the spirit
[1:09:09] he said them young trees though when
[1:09:12] their flesh one can give to the spirit
[1:09:13] and the spirit begin to move them like a
[1:09:15] rushing wind
[1:09:16] filling them full of god's goodness
[1:09:19] that's the kind of life
[1:09:21] it may be a green bunch oh yes it's a
[1:09:24] bunch that's got life in it
[1:09:25] and anything that hasn't got life in it
[1:09:27] is dead
[1:09:29] and if your experiences are dead tonight
[1:09:31] you need to bury the thing
[1:09:32] and won't you come up here and i'll
[1:09:34] introduce you to the green light
[1:09:36] i'll introduce you to the one that's got
[1:09:38] life in him he's here he comes service
[1:09:40] after service
[1:09:41] he's here to move upon the spirit let me
[1:09:43] tell you the problem that god will say
[1:09:44] you give me one or two young people
[1:09:46] on fire for god he'll do more for a
[1:09:49] church than 40 revivals
[1:09:50] give me somebody tonight that's ready to
[1:09:52] worship give me somebody tonight that
[1:09:54] realized i had a past
[1:09:56] but my past don't have me i used to be
[1:09:58] bound but i found no more
[1:10:00] i've been set free i've been released by
[1:10:02] the bondage right from the bottom
[1:10:04] and now i can serve god now i can
[1:10:06] worship god i got a reason to praise him
[1:10:09] i got a reason to worship him
[1:10:12] tell me what you want to call me he's
[1:10:14] called me son he's called me daughter
[1:10:16] he's caught me saved he caught me filled
[1:10:18] with the holy ghost he called me
[1:10:20] and that's all that matters he called me
[1:10:25] i don't care what the critics say
[1:10:31] he turns to simon simon
[1:10:35] you invited me but you didn't make me
[1:10:38] welcome
[1:10:42] my feet needed to be washed but you
[1:10:44] didn't even offer
[1:10:46] my head should have been anointed but
[1:10:48] you didn't even offer
[1:10:49] he wouldn't even give me a kiss to make
[1:10:52] me welcome
[1:10:54] but her sins her past
[1:10:58] her sins that are many are now forgiven
[1:11:01] see mary had a pass
[1:11:05] but her past didn't have her
[1:11:09] because she came in the presence of the
[1:11:11] one
[1:11:12] that can release her from the bondage of
[1:11:15] sin
[1:11:16] and free her from those tormented
[1:11:18] spirits
[1:11:20] and you tonight you may have a path
[1:11:24] but your past doesn't have to have you
[1:11:28] your past doesn't have young people you
[1:11:31] may have done things that you hadn't
[1:11:32] been happy about
[1:11:35] let's put it like this older people you
[1:11:37] may have done things
[1:11:38] that you're sad and they torment you day
[1:11:40] after day and you wake up every morning
[1:11:43] and the first thing that rushes to your
[1:11:44] mind is the act that you did but i want
[1:11:46] you to know
[1:11:47] because you got a path doesn't mean that
[1:11:49] your path has to live with you
[1:11:51] it doesn't have to have that grip on
[1:11:52] your life anymore but i'm here to tell
[1:11:54] you jesus is here
[1:11:56] and he's here so somebody can worship
[1:11:58] him somebody can wash his feet
[1:12:00] somebody can make love to him tonight
[1:12:02] but he's the one
[1:12:03] that can break the yoke off of your life
[1:12:05] and free you from your past
[1:12:08] and set you on your course for a new day
[1:12:11] a new beginning
[1:12:14] how many you gotta pass
[1:12:18] you gotta pass but you're here tonight
[1:12:20] because your past doesn't have
[1:12:22] you you've done things that you're not
[1:12:24] happy about
[1:12:25] you said things that you're not happy
[1:12:27] about there's actions in your life
[1:12:29] that the devil tries to remind you of
[1:12:31] but it doesn't have you
[1:12:32] because you're here tonight it shows
[1:12:35] that you're here tonight
[1:12:36] and if you're still struggling with that
[1:12:38] oh may this just resonate in your heart
[1:12:40] you don't have to be bound any longer
[1:12:42] because i want to liberate
[1:12:44] he's here tonight he's here to loose you
[1:12:47] from your sins
[1:12:48] he's going to loose you from your path
[1:12:50] he's here to free you from your mistake
[1:12:51] he's here tonight to heal to deliver to
[1:12:54] set free
[1:12:55] he's here not joe adams but the almighty
[1:12:58] god
[1:12:58] the angel of the lord is here tonight to
[1:13:01] do exactly
[1:13:02] what he declares
[1:13:08] before her salvation and her liberty men
[1:13:11] would look at her
[1:13:14] i said i'm not going to pay that much
[1:13:15] for her look at her
[1:13:18] she has no value she's a prostitute
[1:13:21] down but doesn't
[1:13:24] see her past may have devalued her work
[1:13:26] to man but it didn't devalue her work to
[1:13:30] god
[1:13:32] jesus took this dirty woman of hill fame
[1:13:36] scarred with sin ruined her life
[1:13:39] she was seeking true love and acceptance
[1:13:43] and he made a daughter of god out of
[1:13:45] here
[1:13:48] you would look at him and say i'm not
[1:13:50] willing to pay that
[1:13:51] because you're looking through the eyes
[1:13:52] of man
[1:13:55] but jesus looks to a different set of
[1:13:58] eyes
[1:14:00] he looks through the eyes of prophecy
[1:14:02] and says i've already had you somewhere
[1:14:05] i've already seen you somewhere and he
[1:14:08] says
[1:14:08] every prophet he ever sent he sent it
[1:14:11] for you
[1:14:12] every every word inscribed on the pages
[1:14:15] of this bible
[1:14:16] he did it for you tonight every beating
[1:14:18] that he took to cut a nine tails
[1:14:20] a crown of thorns that was placed on his
[1:14:22] head the excruciating headache for hours
[1:14:25] the spit the ridicule the shame the
[1:14:27] cross the nails in his hands and his
[1:14:29] feet
[1:14:29] the spirit inside he thought you were
[1:14:32] worth it therefore he took it on upon
[1:14:34] himself
[1:14:36] notice he conquered death because you
[1:14:39] were worth it he
[1:14:40] conquered the grave because you was
[1:14:41] worth it he conquered hell
[1:14:43] because you were worth it he rose on the
[1:14:45] third day because you were worth it
[1:14:49] i should give us a reason tonight don't
[1:14:51] look at your path
[1:14:52] your past is in the past jesus christ
[1:14:54] thought so much about you
[1:14:56] that you may not have no human value but
[1:14:58] to god you mean the world to them
[1:15:00] [Applause]
[1:15:06] brother brown was in a museum in
[1:15:07] tennessee and they were doing an
[1:15:09] analysis of the human body
[1:15:12] i know some of us think we're better
[1:15:14] than others
[1:15:15] we put a 800 suit
[1:15:19] on a 84 cent body and i understand some
[1:15:22] of us got more body than others
[1:15:24] but all in all it's 84 cents
[1:15:28] he brother bam heard over two men over
[1:15:30] talking so my
[1:15:33] man we're not very much army george we
[1:15:36] ain't birth very much before the battle
[1:15:38] couldn't hold itself
[1:15:39] he turned around he said oh boy you may
[1:15:42] not be very much
[1:15:43] worth very much but your soul is worth
[1:15:45] 10 million worlds
[1:15:47] see don't let the devil try to tell you
[1:15:49] you're not worth anything don't let the
[1:15:51] devil tell you you're not valued
[1:15:52] he's constantly digging up your path he
[1:15:54] said look what you did look what you've
[1:15:55] done
[1:15:56] he's the accuser of the brother but the
[1:15:58] accuser's been cast down
[1:16:00] and i'm gonna tell you about a jesus
[1:16:01] who's the liberator jesus who can break
[1:16:04] the yoke off of your life
[1:16:05] jesus who can turn a dirty sinful person
[1:16:07] into a saintly son and daughter of god
[1:16:14] see if any man is in christ he's a new
[1:16:16] creature
[1:16:18] new desires old things are passed away
[1:16:22] and all things have become new everybody
[1:16:24] that ever has been free from the devil
[1:16:26] by the power of jesus knows
[1:16:28] where they're standing no
[1:16:31] one can ever come in his divine presence
[1:16:35] and ever be the same person anymore
[1:16:39] he says you're changed and if you're not
[1:16:42] changed tonight
[1:16:43] is because you've not allowed yourself
[1:16:44] to come in that presence
[1:16:48] step back and you fold your arms while
[1:16:50] everybody else
[1:16:51] is washing feet everybody else is
[1:16:54] kissing
[1:16:55] everybody else is anointing everybody
[1:16:57] else is worshiping
[1:16:59] and you sit back there unconcerned
[1:17:04] all right simon
[1:17:07] criticized got your stones out ready to
[1:17:10] chunk them at somebody well
[1:17:11] look what they just did it was on that
[1:17:14] website last week
[1:17:16] that was last week's news you don't know
[1:17:18] what happened between this week and last
[1:17:20] week
[1:17:21] you don't know that encounter when she
[1:17:23] met jesus
[1:17:24] you don't know that encounter where they
[1:17:25] really surrendered all to god's god
[1:17:27] i'm not gonna go to that website anymore
[1:17:29] i'm giving you my heart it may not
[1:17:31] happen
[1:17:31] in front of all the world on a wednesday
[1:17:33] night or a sunday morning
[1:17:34] it could have been on a tuesday night it
[1:17:36] could have been on a friday night
[1:17:38] it could have been a thursday morning
[1:17:39] how do we know we don't know
[1:17:42] but i'm here to tell you he comes where
[1:17:44] he's invited
[1:17:46] see she had seven devils cast out of her
[1:17:48] pride envy
[1:17:49] she thought she was so pretty and there
[1:17:51] was no one like her
[1:17:53] i'm afraid we got some of that in the
[1:17:55] message as well we got some young ladies
[1:17:57] today they want to dress down
[1:17:58] you know what you can't determine you
[1:18:00] can't do differentiate them from a
[1:18:02] worldly lady or a whirly girl i ain't
[1:18:04] going to say lady because the lady's
[1:18:05] going to
[1:18:05] dress herself in godly apparel and
[1:18:07] conduct herself
[1:18:08] in the right manner but we got those
[1:18:10] around the messes
[1:18:12] just because you claim that you believe
[1:18:14] god sent a prophet doesn't make you a
[1:18:16] believer let me go ahead and put you on
[1:18:17] notice tonight
[1:18:18] but we find she thought she was better
[1:18:20] she thought she was somebody
[1:18:22] but when jesus spoke to her said be thou
[1:18:24] clean all of that
[1:18:26] left all of the desires that she used to
[1:18:28] have to put on the makeup
[1:18:30] it began to leave her she no longer had
[1:18:32] that desire anymore she no longer cut
[1:18:35] her hair anymore
[1:18:36] and dressed in a provocative way to draw
[1:18:38] the attention
[1:18:39] of man to her she no longer was
[1:18:40] concerned about
[1:18:42] attracting the attention of man now she
[1:18:44] was concerned
[1:18:45] about attracting the detention of
[1:18:47] almighty god
[1:18:48] what will it take how does he want me to
[1:18:50] trespass how does he want me to look how
[1:18:52] does he want me that
[1:18:53] how do i know how he wants me to be
[1:18:58] oh my she was now free
[1:19:01] and the things that she used to do the
[1:19:04] lifestyle that she used to desire
[1:19:06] she doesn't do them anymore she doesn't
[1:19:09] desire them
[1:19:10] anymore but she goes to this party
[1:19:13] notice now
[1:19:15] as i continue to go on give me just a

[1:19:23] wrestling match
[1:19:24] going on in her mind she knows there's a
[1:19:26] party
[1:19:27] she knows that jesus is in attendance
[1:19:29] and she knows he's pushed to the corner
[1:19:32] nobody is worshiping him nobody is
[1:19:35] acknowledging him

[1:19:55] there's a pool
[1:19:56] in your heart to serve god there's a
[1:19:58] pull in your heart to surrender all but
[1:20:00] there's something hanging on you
[1:20:02] called your path that doesn't want to
[1:20:04] release you
[1:20:05] into that power into that presence
[1:20:09] see you waited a long time she waited a
[1:20:10] long time the prophet of god would say
[1:20:12] don't you stay where you are how long
[1:20:14] time you've been wanting to really be a
[1:20:16] christian
[1:20:16] you've waited a long time it's getting

[1:20:38] it's time we stop pulling back when the
[1:20:41] spirit of god begins to fall and come
[1:20:43] down
[1:20:44] but the devil's there to say you know
[1:20:45] what hey stay in your seat

[1:20:50] know you got something in your life

[1:20:55] to tell that preacher what you've been
[1:20:57] doing
[1:20:58] he'll tell everybody
[1:21:01] but you desire to be free mary magdalene
[1:21:04] desire
[1:21:05] since that first instance with that
[1:21:07] young boy
[1:21:08] to find freedom to clean her life back
[1:21:12] up she was raised in a christian home
[1:21:15] her brother was lazarus and her sister
[1:21:17] was martha
[1:21:19] she knew about the power of god
[1:21:22] they knew about the messiah he's coming
[1:21:26] even like he's here we're not waiting
[1:21:30] on his coming he's here he's been here
[1:21:34] you waited a long time you desire to be
[1:21:36] free you want to be a real christian
[1:21:38] let me declare he's here he's here
[1:21:42] tonight to free you from your past he's
[1:21:43] here to give you a new future
[1:21:45] he's here to deliver you he's here to
[1:21:46] heal you he's here to break the yoke
[1:21:49] of bondage off of your life
[1:21:53] isaiah 10 and verse 27 says he shall
[1:21:55] come to pass in that day
[1:21:57] that his burden shall be taken away from
[1:21:59] off the shoulder
[1:22:00] who's burning the enemy's burden he's
[1:22:02] going to be taken off the shoulder
[1:22:04] and his yoke from off thy neck and the
[1:22:06] yoke shall be
[1:22:07] destroyed because of the anointing
[1:22:10] it's the anointing that breaks the yoke
[1:22:13] and if you still got the yoke of sin on
[1:22:15] you let me tell you
[1:22:16] the anointing is here service after
[1:22:18] service
[1:22:19] but you got to bring that yolk up to the
[1:22:21] altar you got to bring your life subject
[1:22:23] to the word
[1:22:24] and say i'm tired of living this way i
[1:22:26] want to serve god brother joe
[1:22:28] i want to surrender everything and it'll
[1:22:30] change your life
[1:22:31] from this day forward and you won't
[1:22:33] desire the things that you used to
[1:22:36] desire
[1:22:38] something inside with her was telling
[1:22:39] her to go in she wanted to do jesus a
[1:22:42] service
[1:22:43] but like many of us well it's what are
[1:22:46] they going to think
[1:22:49] what are they going to think i mean
[1:22:52] my goodness my dad's a deacon or my
[1:22:55] husband's a deacon or my
[1:22:56] my wife is this or we you know we start
[1:22:59] setting ourselves up on pedestals
[1:23:03] thinking nobody is in here is a center
[1:23:06] but there's three kind of believers in
[1:23:08] every service
[1:23:11] see the thing was brother brown would
[1:23:12] say was not how she was going to get
[1:23:14] there
[1:23:15] but was she going to make the effort to
[1:23:16] get there some of you came on a
[1:23:18] wednesday night tonight
[1:23:20] but are you going to get there are you
[1:23:23] going to get there
[1:23:24] are you going to get to his feet you
[1:23:26] made the effort
[1:23:28] you're in the place for you to get there
[1:23:30] where you can worship him
[1:23:32] brother brown said i could see her
[1:23:34] elbowing her way down through the crowd
[1:23:35] no matter what they said
[1:23:37] she was on her road to meet jesus do you
[1:23:40] do that
[1:23:41] no matter what they say no brother joe i
[1:23:44] quench the spirit
[1:23:46] some of us have felt the spirit of god
[1:23:48] move right across our pew
[1:23:52] we all not all but some of us and we sit
[1:23:55] there
[1:23:56] because we don't want to allow ourselves
[1:23:58] to be free to it
[1:24:00] because we may speak in tongues we may
[1:24:03] jump up and dance
[1:24:05] and we may do something else we don't
[1:24:07] know there's times that i have felt the
[1:24:09] spirit of god move
[1:24:10] and i sit there because i'm on the
[1:24:12] platform then it moves somewhere else
[1:24:15] because somebody's going to speak in
[1:24:16] tongues when it declares to be spoken
[1:24:19] somebody's going to dance in the spirit
[1:24:20] when it's there to be danced with
[1:24:23] somebody's going to give a shout when
[1:24:25] the spirit moves
[1:24:27] so we find here are we going to elbow
[1:24:30] our way through all the
[1:24:31] differences of the world can we up our
[1:24:33] way through the vulgarity all the
[1:24:34] picture shows now
[1:24:35] we find that our young people are tied
[1:24:37] to social entertainment
[1:24:40] i started telling my kids i'll tell you
[1:24:42] what for every minute you have on social
[1:24:44] media or on your ipad or your iphone i
[1:24:46] want that much time in the word
[1:24:48] either you listen to a tape or you read
[1:24:50] your bible you put an hour in over here
[1:24:51] you put an hour in where you give god
[1:24:53] equal
[1:24:55] oh it'll change their habits he don't
[1:24:57] change they realize oh i'm consuming a
[1:24:59] whole lot of social media
[1:25:01] i'm consuming a whole lot of screen time
[1:25:03] and i ain't giving god a whole lot of
[1:25:05] nothing
[1:25:05] but when you draw the line right there
[1:25:07] and say you give god the same amount you
[1:25:09] give this
[1:25:10] your father and start having a real
[1:25:12] experience
[1:25:13] and begin to push away some of the
[1:25:15] things that are attracting their
[1:25:16] attention
[1:25:18] see she was going to get there
[1:25:19] regardless of how valve she was
[1:25:23] brother bam would say i know it was out
[1:25:25] of order god help us to get out of order
[1:25:27] once in a while
[1:25:28] the trouble of it is you got too much
[1:25:30] order get out of order i hope the church
[1:25:33] gets out of order long enough
[1:25:35] to get saved now he's telling this to a
[1:25:38] pentecostal group
[1:25:41] too much order in pentecost oh my
[1:25:44] goodness don't come to the message
[1:25:47] when we so church order down it ain't
[1:25:49] funny
[1:25:50] we sing three songs at the beginning of
[1:25:52] a service two songs at the end
[1:25:54] and we're dismissing we're done we don't
[1:25:55] give the spirit of god time to do
[1:25:57] nothing
[1:25:58] if he can't happen when the preacher is
[1:26:00] preaching so what get you next time
[1:26:03] hop in the services you man you preach
[1:26:06] the house down the song leader comes up
[1:26:07] sees a couple of songs and just
[1:26:09] kills the anointing
[1:26:13] now if i could sing i wouldn't let that
[1:26:14] man have the mic
[1:26:16] buddy you can stay over there i you
[1:26:18] ain't getting it back you kill the
[1:26:19] servants
[1:26:19] i don't work too hard for this
[1:26:23] but you're fine because we're so on
[1:26:25] church order so traditional
[1:26:28] so bound to well this is the way it's
[1:26:29] always done
[1:26:31] and by the way brother joe you've been
[1:26:32] longer than 45 minutes you need to hurry
[1:26:34] up shut down
[1:26:36] well i'm sorry critic i'm not bound by
[1:26:38] your time element
[1:26:41] i'm listening and i'm leaning on the
[1:26:43] everlasting arm
[1:26:44] i'm feeling the pulsation of the spirit
[1:26:47] and i'm gonna tell you i don't have a
[1:26:48] past anymore
[1:26:50] and that path don't hold me your
[1:26:51] denominational ideas can't hold me
[1:26:54] i can't be held by broken chain i've
[1:26:56] been loosed by the liberator
[1:26:58] i've been set free and i'm here to
[1:26:59] worship god and i don't care about your
[1:27:02] time
[1:27:02] i don't care about your church order
[1:27:05] when god comes down and anoints the
[1:27:08] service that's what i'm looking for
[1:27:10] that's how i say amen to the word it
[1:27:13] please god so much to come by our way
[1:27:19] see jesus has a reputation
[1:27:23] his reputation is has been made in the
[1:27:26] presence of sinners
[1:27:28] there never was a blind man that ever
[1:27:29] into his presence but didn't walk away
[1:27:31] seeing with his side he never was a
[1:27:33] crippled man that ever came
[1:27:36] in his presence but what didn't leave
[1:27:37] dancing and rejoicing
[1:27:39] never was a sinner that truly wanted to
[1:27:41] serve god that ever came into his
[1:27:43] presence
[1:27:44] but walked down a son and daughter of
[1:27:46] god
[1:27:48] with no past no past
[1:27:53] and he's inviting you tonight to come in
[1:27:56] that presence

[1:29:16] views god i hope you don't

[1:29:42] leave
[1:29:42] his presence what an invitation what an
[1:29:45] opportunity
[1:29:46] and it takes place right now when you
[1:29:49] get before the feet of jesus
[1:29:51] and begin to worship him
[1:29:54] oh hallelujah well we'll be thinking why
[1:29:58] did job
[1:29:59] why did he send me an imitation look at
[1:30:02] me i'm quirky
[1:30:04] i got joe isms i'm losing my hair
[1:30:07] i'm nobody we always worry about the why
[1:30:11] don't worry he chose you
[1:30:16] he chose you
[1:30:19] brother william he chose you because he
[1:30:20] knew exactly what laid on the inside of
[1:30:22] him
[1:30:23] i used to wrestle well god why did you
[1:30:26] call me to the ministry
[1:30:27] look at me sometimes i stumble over my
[1:30:29] words i
[1:30:30] spit worse than you're forning
[1:30:34] get so excited i can't keep my train of
[1:30:36] thought i'm all over the place i'm
[1:30:38] running like a panty rooster
[1:30:39] nobody else does that and when they
[1:30:41] preaching
[1:30:44] i tried to teach failure no gift there
[1:30:49] somebody said true god forgive them but
[1:30:52] they're being honest
[1:30:54] i tried i tried to teach one time sat
[1:30:56] down was going to do a bible study on
[1:30:57] the holy ghost
[1:30:58] i preached the whole time sitting down i
[1:31:00] want to do everything i could to stand
[1:31:01] up
[1:31:02] so i shook that thing i said next time
[1:31:04] we're going to be standing up we're
[1:31:04] preaching the holy ghost we ain't
[1:31:06] teaching it
[1:31:08] you start we start realizing there's
[1:31:10] things in other people's lives
[1:31:11] that we won't and we aspire to
[1:31:15] you know i look at brother john andes
[1:31:17] and i love his optimism i love his
[1:31:18] attitude
[1:31:19] i don't have that then we start
[1:31:22] degrading our own value
[1:31:23] because we're not like somebody else god
[1:31:26] why'd you choose me
[1:31:27] because god had you before the
[1:31:29] foundation of the world that's why god
[1:31:31] chose you
[1:31:32] because you was a thought in the mind of
[1:31:33] god that's why god chose you
[1:31:38] but the bible will say and this morning
[1:31:40] the holy spirit through the word
[1:31:42] is bringing you the good news from
[1:31:43] before the foundation of the world
[1:31:45] god wrote your name on the lamb's book
[1:31:48] of life
[1:31:49] oh why do you care he wrote it there
[1:31:51] that's all that should matter to us
[1:31:52] god you chose me you must have saw
[1:31:55] something inside of me
[1:31:56] that i didn't see him myself but god i
[1:31:58] thank you tonight that you told me
[1:32:00] before the foundation you knew i would
[1:32:01] do this
[1:32:02] you knew i would have a past but
[1:32:04] nevertheless you looked beyond my path
[1:32:06] and you looked to my future and you
[1:32:08] called me by name and you called me son
[1:32:10] and you called me daughter and you
[1:32:12] called me forgiven and you called me
[1:32:14] saved
[1:32:14] and you called me filled with the holy
[1:32:16] ghost god you count on me
[1:32:18] for this moment you called me for such a
[1:32:21] time as this
[1:32:24] you're not a christian by your own
[1:32:25] desire no you're a christian by
[1:32:28] god's desire no man can come accept the
[1:32:31] father draws

[1:32:35] foundation of the world

[1:34:52] your paths don't have to hold you
[1:34:56] the christian has not one worry
[1:35:00] in the world
[1:35:04] i'm going to say that again
[1:35:08] the christian i mean you're a christian
[1:35:10] tonight
[1:35:12] how many's got to pass
[1:35:15] the christian doesn't have one word in
[1:35:18] the world
[1:35:20] not one not one not one worry
[1:35:24] in the world they should be the most
[1:35:26] freest happiest
[1:35:28] people in all the world because there's
[1:35:32] nothing
[1:35:33] you can't lose
[1:35:36] did you hear that young person the
[1:35:39] devil's constantly reminding you of your
[1:35:40] failures
[1:35:41] because you know what some of you are in
[1:35:42] an awkward stage you're trying to find
[1:35:45] yourself
[1:35:46] you're trying to explore you're looking
[1:35:47] at things that you shouldn't be looking
[1:35:49] at doing things you shouldn't be doing
[1:35:51] and the devil is there to just ridicule
[1:35:52] kill ridicule and condemn condemn
[1:35:55] condemned and accused
[1:35:56] accused of accused
[1:35:59] but the prophet of god would say
[1:36:02] you can't lose
[1:36:06] i puts a whole another twist on getting
[1:36:09] up every day
[1:36:10] and saying god i'm here to serve you
[1:36:12] because i can't lose
[1:36:13] no matter what i face today no matter
[1:36:15] what i did yesterday
[1:36:16] i can't lose today the prophet of god
[1:36:19] will say you know what
[1:36:20] he goes i if you know positioning who
[1:36:21] you was and what you are tonight
[1:36:24] there wouldn't be one feeble person in
[1:36:26] the next five minutes
[1:36:28] right now we are the sons of god
[1:36:32] well i don't feel like it i don't care
[1:36:33] how you feel it ain't based on your
[1:36:35] feelings
[1:36:35] your feelings are lie to you but right
[1:36:37] now i'm going to tell you
[1:36:39] you are a son and daughter of god
[1:36:43] but you got to go confessing that you've
[1:36:46] been in that presence
[1:36:48] that you've been there in the supreme
[1:36:50] authority that jesus
[1:36:52] has given to every believer anything
[1:36:53] that you have a desire of tonight
[1:36:56] because you know your position my
[1:36:58] brother joe i did this
[1:36:59] but you know your position
[1:37:03] you know the one that called you and if
[1:37:05] he called you he elected you
[1:37:09] and if he elected you he's anointed you
[1:37:12] the prophet of god would say when he
[1:37:14] anointed you he positionally placed you
[1:37:16] in the body
[1:37:17] and there ain't enough devils in hell
[1:37:20] can take that place
[1:37:23] so i don't care what your past is
[1:37:26] your past has no bearing on your future
[1:37:31] mary you may have a past tonight but
[1:37:34] your past doesn't have you
[1:37:35] want the musicians come see it doesn't
[1:37:39] make any difference
[1:37:40] what your past has been when you get an
[1:37:42] invitation to come
[1:37:45] come when you get an invitation
[1:37:48] to serve and to worship and to humble
[1:37:51] yourself
[1:37:53] he says come you ready to come if you've
[1:37:56] been bad if you've been a street walker
[1:37:58] if you if you've been a gambler if
[1:38:01] you've been a drunkard if you've been a
[1:38:03] murderer
[1:38:03] no matter what you've been if god gives
[1:38:06] you an invitation
[1:38:07] and he's knocking on your heart's door
[1:38:10] he'll take care of the rest of him
[1:38:13] don't worry and say well i'm just a
[1:38:15] lukewarm church member
[1:38:16] he'll take care of that too
[1:38:20] see if you'll just heed the invitation
[1:38:24] whosoever will let him come and drink in
[1:38:27] the waters of life
[1:38:29] freely we all have a pass
[1:38:32] and tonight you can make that step in
[1:38:36] the right direction i'm not going to let
[1:38:37] my path define
[1:38:39] who i am this time forward i'm going to
[1:38:41] give god my all
[1:38:43] i'm going to worship god i want you by
[1:38:45] your heads tonight
[1:38:52] you're here tonight like many of us
[1:38:56] the devil has accused you and he's
[1:38:58] constantly reminded you of your failures
[1:39:00] constantly reminded you of your mistakes
[1:39:03] actions that you've done
[1:39:05] you wake up every morning and you feel
[1:39:07] condemned
[1:39:09] you go to bed every night and you ask
[1:39:12] yourself
[1:39:13] there's no use why do i even try
[1:39:19] i woke up every morning bound by devils
[1:39:23] living of life a prostitution
[1:39:27] one man after the other after the other
[1:39:29] after the other
[1:39:30] until she finally came into the presence
[1:39:33] of the one that can break the yoke
[1:39:37] church he's here tonight i don't know
[1:39:38] what your past has been
[1:39:41] and it really doesn't matter but i know
[1:39:42] there's one here tonight
[1:39:44] who can break that yoke
[1:39:48] you know there's things that brother
[1:39:49] joe's done in his past
[1:39:52] years ago as a young teenage boy things
[1:39:54] that i'm not proud of things that i
[1:39:55] never expressed to no one
[1:39:59] because it's not worthy to be expressed
[1:40:02] but i don't let that hinder me
[1:40:05] from worshiping god and i say that to
[1:40:09] tell you tonight we all
[1:40:11] have had a path we've all had made our
[1:40:13] failures and stumbled
[1:40:16] and come short of the glory of god
[1:40:19] but he sought thought so much to come by
[1:40:21] even like tabernacle on wednesday night
[1:40:25] to tell you i still do impossible things
[1:40:28] it may not look like you can find the
[1:40:30] victory in your life but i'm here
[1:40:31] tonight to tell you
[1:40:32] i'm the one that can bring the liberty
[1:40:34] i'm the one that can release you from
[1:40:36] your prison cell
[1:40:37] i'm the one that can change you i'm the
[1:40:39] one that can take your past
[1:40:41] and drop it in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:40:43] and i'll never remember it again
[1:40:46] see we look at our past and we ask god
[1:40:49] god what
[1:40:50] about my past what about the things i've
[1:40:52] done what about the thoughts i've had
[1:40:56] god looks at you and he says what past
[1:40:59] he says when i think about your past
[1:41:01] little bride
[1:41:03] i think about your past i think about
[1:41:05] that image i took before the foundation
[1:41:07] of the world
[1:41:08] i think about you being perfect i think
[1:41:10] about you being sinless
[1:41:11] i think about you being the virtuous son
[1:41:13] and daughter of god
[1:41:16] that's the only past he thinks about
[1:41:20] so you may have a past tonight but your
[1:41:22] past doesn't have to have you
[1:41:26] father we just commit this time to you
[1:41:28] now lord we thank you for the
[1:41:30] move another spirit lord we thank you
[1:41:32] for your words of liberation as you
[1:41:33] would come and just speak to our hearts
[1:41:36] lord have i labored and studied and
[1:41:38] prayed and asked you to move in such a
[1:41:40] way that would bring glory to your name
[1:41:42] i'm asking tonight lord that these words
[1:41:45] they would fall on fertile ground father
[1:41:47] you know each of us
[1:41:49] we've had our struggles lord whoever
[1:41:52] human
[1:41:53] in this life is full of disappointments
[1:41:55] lord and this body is unconverted and
[1:41:57] our actions sometimes
[1:41:59] lord speak of that unconversion but god
[1:42:01] we're so thankful tonight we have a
[1:42:03] savior
[1:42:04] we're thankful tonight lord we have a
[1:42:06] redeemer we have one that can release us
[1:42:08] and break the yoke of sin and unbelief
[1:42:11] and whatever it may be
[1:42:12] from off our hearts and our lives lord
[1:42:14] as you took mary
[1:42:18] from a city of prostitution he brought
[1:42:20] her into the presence
[1:42:22] of jesus not once but multiple times
[1:42:25] and lord you completely eradicated sin
[1:42:28] from her life
[1:42:31] and she began to serve you and follow
[1:42:32] you and to worship you lord
[1:42:35] and i heard a preacher say one time that
[1:42:37] mary is a type of this bride
[1:42:41] she come into his presence bound by sin
[1:42:44] and bound by unbelief
[1:42:46] found by the changes of past mistakes
[1:42:48] and failures
[1:42:51] but she didn't stay bound she was freed
[1:42:54] and when she was freed
[1:42:56] she began to worship the savior
[1:43:00] she was found faithful she was well she
[1:43:03] was on attention at the tomb that day
[1:43:04] god
[1:43:06] she was ready because she'd done so much
[1:43:09] for father may we
[1:43:11] as your church as your people tonight
[1:43:13] lord
[1:43:14] never be guilty of pushing you in a
[1:43:15] corner
[1:43:18] because of our past we asked the lord
[1:43:21] tonight that these words were just touch
[1:43:23] every heart and every life that was on
[1:43:26] the stream lord
[1:43:28] may they too just feel this same
[1:43:30] anointing that's here tonight lord
[1:43:33] it's an anointing of freedom we don't
[1:43:35] have to be bound any longer
[1:43:39] we don't have to listen to the accuser
[1:43:42] not when the jesus the lamb of god is
[1:43:44] present
[1:43:46] and he's the lamb that takes away the
[1:43:47] sin of the world and we're so thankful
[1:43:49] tonight father
[1:43:51] that you've taken away our sins we just
[1:43:53] commit this service to you now lord
[1:43:56] may you just just remain father let your
[1:43:59] spirit just begin to move over as lord
[1:44:01] as we just offer up our worship to you
[1:44:04] as we turn this service into an
[1:44:05] atmosphere of worship let your spirit
[1:44:07] just
[1:44:08] begin to move lord begin to settle on
[1:44:11] every heart
[1:44:13] begin to break that yoke upon his father
[1:44:15] we ask it now in jesus name
[1:44:18] amen amen
