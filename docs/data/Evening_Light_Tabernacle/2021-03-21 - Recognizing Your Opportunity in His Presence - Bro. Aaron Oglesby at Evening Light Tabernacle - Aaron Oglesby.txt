from the presence of almighty god lord we are believers and that's why we have gathered lord lord we believe in your word where it says where two or three gather in my name there i am in their midst lord lord so we know and we recognize today father that you are here with us lord may we not be like those lord that would put jesus in the corner this morning with dirty feet but lord like the woman who came and poured out the bottle upon his feet of perfume and began to wash his feet with her hair because lord you had done so much for her and oh lord jesus there's a people gathered here today that recognizes lord you've done so much for us lord you have healed our sick you saved our loss you've delivered the bound and we are here today to pour out our praise father lord we long to worship you we long to be in your presence lord i ask that not one person would miss it i ask that we would recognize today lord god where we're standing who we are who you are lord in our relationship to you father lord we love you with all of our heart we thank you lord jesus for all that you've done in our midst and we look forward to what you're going to do right now today in this service father lord for we know you never fail to show up where you're invited we love you lord and as we turn our attention now to the word i pray you'll bless the reading of the word lord i pray you'll anoint my lips and remove my thoughts and my anything i would want to say and take it out the way lord god and you speak today you use this vessel father i pray lord and anoint the people to hear lord i'm asking you to take complete control now take complete preeminence and may something be said lord to bless your people lord i recognize the magnitude of this moment as i stand before the purchase of your blood these are your people father and i pray you speak now lord in jesus name amen amen isn't it wonderful to be in the house of god this morning wonderful to be in his presence hallelujah hallelujah if you have your bibles with you this morning ask that you'll turn with me to the book of matthew the 13th chapter we'll read from there and then we'll take our seats and we have a few other places we'd like to read from brother e.j good to see you in the house of god this morning after your surgery i'm glad the lord brought you through that god bless you wonderful to see you here this morning we're going to read here from matthew 13 53. i'd like to speak to you today on recognizing your opportunity and his presence recognizing your opportunity in his presence matthew 13 53 says and it came to pass that when jesus had finished these parables he departed thence and when he was coming to his own country he taught them in their synagogue in so much that they were astonished and he said wence and and they were astonished and said whence had this man this wisdom and these mighty works is not this the carpenter's son is not this is not his mother called mary and his brethren james and joseph and simon and judas and his sisters are they not all with us whence then hath this man all these things and they were offended in him but jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honor save in his own country and in his own house and he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief you may have your seats this morning as you're taking your seat if you'll turn also to mark 10 we're going to read a couple more scriptures before we get started mark 10 and the 46th verse it says when they came to jericho and as he went out of jericho with his disciples and a great number of people blind bartimaeus the son of timaeus set by the highway side begging and when he heard that it was jesus of nazareth he began to cry out and say jesus thou son of david have mercy on me and many charged him that she he should hold his peace but he cried the more a great deal thou son of david have mercy on me and jesus stood still and commanded him to be called and they called the blind man saying unto him be of good comfort rise he calleth thee and he casting away his garment rose and came to jesus and jesus answered and said unto him what wilt thou that i should do unto thee the blind man said unto him lord that i might receive my sight and jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith have made thee whole and immediately he received his sight and followed jesus in the way and finally we're going to look over in luke the 23rd chapter and the 39th verse luke 23 and 39. it's a very familiar story to us there at the crucifixion and it says and one of the male factors which were hanged railed on him saying if thou be christ save thyself and us but the other answering rebuked him saying dost not thou fear god seeing thou art in the same condemnation and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our deeds but this man hath done nothing amiss and he said unto jesus lord remember me when thou cometh into thy kingdom and jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee today shalt thou be with me in paradise as you read the bible you find many times many characters it's it's a contradiction of different ones you have those that recognize their need of god and they recognize god and they receive what they have need of and then there's many characters in the bible that do not recognize their need of god they do not recognize when he moves and therefore they are passed by and they do not recognize they don't receive what it is that they need and these three scriptures that we just read three seemingly unrelated scriptures from three different books of the bible but the way these tied together for the sake of our message today is that in all three we see opportunities we see people with opportunities in god's presence there in matthew we see them absolutely astounded not only at his teaching but also at the mighty works i mean they're astounded by it they love what he's saying they love the works that they're that that they're witnessing and yet in one verse they go from astounded to doubt in one verse they go to doubt because they begin to focus on why this couldn't be god they begin to focus on well if this was god it would be this way and if it was god it would be this way in the way i was taught in the way i believe it will come surely this can't be from god and they begin to focus on that and their astonishment instantly turns into doubt listen if you want to overlook god in a service if you want to find fault with the ministry or find fault with your brothers and sisters it's very easy to do just turn your attention away from what you're witnessing and what you're hearing and all the things god's doing and you'll see the negative the negatives there if you want to find it and that's what they began to do they began to turn away and try to see why this can't be from god and because they couldn't recognize who he was and he couldn't recognize who he was they were unable to believe even though they heard the works even though they they saw the works and heard the teachings they couldn't believe it they couldn't receive it and because of that he couldn't do many mighty things in their midst church may that never be the testimony of evening like tabernacle that he couldn't do many works in our midst but when we see him moving may we recognize it may we grab hold to it may we say lord i have need of thee today i have need of you in this moment right now in mark we find a desperate blind man we know him as blind bartimaeus and he recognizes his opportunity it always astounds me that to say it a blind man recognized his opportunity he didn't see the miracles he wasn't in the services he didn't know the testimonies but he'd been taught right he'd been raised right by a mama that told him that there was a coming savior and he didn't see anything but he had faith and he had heard the word and he believed and in that moment because of his faith he was made whole because he recognized something that he couldn't even see church we're without excuse how many miracles have we seen in this place how many time has god come and done the supernatural in front of us and yet a blonde man recognized his opportunity a blind man who saw nothing said thou son of david have mercy on me and yet we've seen and we've heard we can't let him pass through this building without crying out to him this morning and finally in luke we come to a well-known story of the thieves hanging on the cross next to jesus both at the end of their road both wretched miserable people and both with the exact same opportunity notice both are in the presence of jesus and both are given the opportunity to be a part of the last conversation jesus will ever have as a man before he dies what an opportunity the last conversation that our lord jesus christ is ever going to have and one recognizes what an opportunity this is what a moment this is and he recognizes his need and he recognizes and here's the key the one that can provide for my need is here right now in this moment next to me listen your opportunity may not arrive in the most ideal of circumstances your ideal man your opportunity may not arrive sitting just in a church pew it may not be on the best day of the week it may not be when everything's going right it may be when your life is turned upside down it may be things were going wrong every which way and your family torn apart but when he comes you got to recognize this is my moment this is my opportunity this is my savior he can provide what i have need of maybe both of them were raised in good homes maybe both of them grew up new in the prophecies maybe they both had known isaiah 9 6. and yet in their moment one was conscious of his need and he recognized whose presence he was in and he died and he went to paradise and one was unconscious of whose presence he was in and he died and went to hell one thing i want us to recognize today is a lack of recognition doesn't mean it wasn't your opportunity just because you failed to grab it doesn't mean he didn't come by your way just because you didn't seize the opportunity doesn't mean opportunity wasn't given do not fail to see your opportunity do not fail to recognize him when he moves past us we must be a god-conscious people time after time brother brown would talk about recognize his presence he would speak about being aware of his presence he would tell people you must be god conscious there are over over a thousand quotes dealing with aware conscious recognizing and the importance of not missing opportunities in his presence he would say may every sick person in here be healed tonight granite lord may there be such a scream go up lord until tomorrow that the city will be awakened with great testimonies everywhere and men may come conscious of god and get away from this earthbound sense move out into the realms of the supernatural and believe the lord jesus christ blessed father we are indeed privileged tonight to be here in this great city of south men and a greater privilege than that is to be assembled with these great people tonight the purchase of thy blood and we would ask you to visit us with a great visitation of thy presence and make us all god conscious tonight that you are ever near make us all god conscious this morning lord that you are ever near that you are with us in this service you'll be with us when we leave you'll be with us in our homes the angels of the lord and camp about those that fear him lord we are conscious of your presence this morning that's exactly what satan doesn't want to happen that's why he brings circumstance that's why he clogs the channel that's why he moves and brings disturbances that's exactly what he can't have you recognize that whatever you find yourself in today whatever your situation is god is right there with you in that moment he is with you in that situation he hasn't left your side he's ever near he's the ever-present help in the time of need so what he don't want you to recognize is that your victory is standing right next to you this morning your moment of deliverance is right next to you this morning he's not a thousand miles away he's in your pew he's next to you he's walking up and down this aisle victory is in the building this morning satan wars against you to try to make you miss that opportunity look our battle is to be conscious of god in a world that has put him completely out of their minds to be conscious of god in a world that has come to put him completely out of their thinking completely out of their consciousness and if he is brought into their thinking is looked at with disdain he's looked at with contempt his teaching the bible his word is looked at with disdain and contempt you are looked at with disdain and contempt because you have some semblance of morals you have something that matches up with the word of god there's goodness and there's righteousness and they hate it because your life condemns their life your life cries out against the life they're living your life speaks of better things and they can't take it because the darkness comprehendeth it not so you're looked at with contempt the word is looked at with contempt and they don't even acknowledge his existence much less his presence currently working and to those that and to those that do say they believe it's more of a perspective of an i was god instead of an i am god we live in an ever increasing anti-god society that it does all it can all it can to influence you to make you unaware of the presence of almighty god to make you miss your opportunities these these statistics here i found pretty amazing in 1999 which doesn't seem that long ago to me i was a senior in high school a lot of you were not born a lot of you were already old i didn't say that i didn't see it 1999 70 of americans were church members i looked at that number and i went wow it was a good place in 1999. i mean it's just kind of how it made me feel really 7 out of 10 people in this country went to church 2020 50 are church members that includes everybody catholics baptist pentecost methodist assemblies non-denomination you name it anybody that claims christianity 50 of americans are church members here's the bad part 41 of that 50 actually go to church on a regular basis we are in an anti-god godless society that has put him out of their minds has put him out of their consciousness he they have pushed him so far away they can't even recognize him when he moves they can't recognize the presence of god they don't recognize the goodness of god but you have to recognize you have to be aware you can't miss your opportunity we can't keep looking at what are they doing what are they doing what are they doing their calling is not my business my calling is to take a rapture my calling is to serve god my calling is to overcome my calling is to be victorious so i'm going to look at me and i'ma say as for me and my house in this godless society in this godless civilization we will serve the lord we will walk according to his statutes we will walk according to his word as for me and my house as for evening like tabernacle we will serve the lord hallelujah prophet says you know it used to be if a woman or man said they was a christian people respected it but today they just like to see how much fun they can make out of it see this irreverent group my why why do they do that this is the reason they're not conscious that that's the truth they're not conscious of god oh what a dark picture what an evil world that we live in but let me tell you something church somebody's gonna recognize him somebody's gonna overcome somebody's gonna wash his feet somebody's gonna say that's my lord that's my savior that's the holy ghost moving in our midst that's my deliverer that's the one i have need of lord jesus have mercy on me this morning somebody's gonna call out in spite of it all because church he's not just coming back for a bunch of people that claim i'm a christian he's not just coming back for some people that go to church every now and again or some people that claim the message he's coming back for people that love his appearing he's coming back for people who love him and recognize him and worship him he is their all in all he is their everything that's who he's coming back for i say lord let me be one of those light the fire in my heart may i always be aware may i always be conscious may i always be looking for your presence this bride will be in tune with the presence of god because they love him they seek daily to live in his presence they recognize him in all their blessings in all good things they recognize this is god this is god's hand upon my life they are conscious of him moving in their services they honor him and cry out to him when he passes by his presence is heaven to them his presence is everything to them and like moses said there in exodus 33 if thy presence go not with me carry us not up hence lord i can't face today without your presence i can't face tomorrow without your presence i can't face the next day without your presence so today lord i'm looking for it today i'm looking for my opportunity i'm going to grab hold because i know you're going to go before me i know you're going to drive out the enemy i know you're going to bring me victory i must have you in my life every moment every day every hour i must have you well he's here he's here not just in this age not just in this world he's in this building today he's here to rescue you he's here to save you he's here to deliver you but you've got to recognize it it can't just be oh look sister's getting a blessing oh look brother's getting a blessing oh hitting this wonderful hallelujah that's great we should enter in when others get a blessing but every service is your opportunity every service is your moment every service you should be desperate god i have need of you now this bride will be god conscious conscious means aware of now here's the part that gets a lot of aware of and responding to and conscious means aware of and responding to listen you can have your eyes wide open and not be conscious you can seemingly be awake and not be conscious there must be a responding to when the holy spirit sweeps across the place and the place erupts and you sit there and look around like what's going on it's because you're not conscious it's because you're not aware of what's happening you're not aware of who's in the building surely we believe the scripture where two or three are gathered there i am in the midst if we really believe that scripture how do we act the way we act in church if we really believe the king of kings is right here right now there should be a cry that goes forth from our heart there should be a worship a praise a repentance a cry out he's here he's here right now he's here but sometimes it takes a blind man to recognize him church you've seen you've heard and you know he's here he deserves all you have oh he said the rocks would cry out some of us think they need to rewrite that to say if i don't do my part the rocks will nod the reason people nod because sometimes we can't tell the difference as if you're agreeing or falling asleep i'm not sure if you're with me if you're dreaming can't tell conscious aware of and responding to one's surroundings painfully aware of means you can't sit still you can't hardly stand it the spirit's moving and it's almost painful to sit still it's painful to stay in your seat and you see people that are painfully aware because they sit there and all of a sudden they can't take it no more and they erupt out of the seat they come out of the seat they come praising because they're painfully aware they're sensitive to they're conscious of they're responding to his presence before the fall of man being conscious of god was not difficult adam had never experienced doubt he had never experienced fear he had never experienced unbelief the things that we fight with today that blinds us to that realm the thing that makes it difficult for us to recognize his presence he wasn't familiar with these he didn't even know of their existence it's after the fall in genesis 3 10 that the word afraid is first used genesis 3 10 and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself if the voice of god booms forth in a church service and the response to it or the voice itself brings fear you can place yourself right there because there's something wrong and you're hiding yourself from it there's no freedom and you're scared of it you're scared to move in it because there's something not right so you hide yourself from his presence right in that moment satan recognizes his weapon to keep people from being blessed in his presence fear he saw that fear would keep you from running to him and it would cause you to run from him and it would cause you to hide from the very one who could deliver you the phrase fear not is used at least 80 times in the bible fear not fear not fear not fear not fear not fear not it's because the lord knowing what the enemy would do knowing how he would attack you knowing how he would pull upon you because he knows satan uses fear to make you miss your opportunities satan uses fear to limit your victories satan uses fear to keep you from receiving everything in a service or everything during the week or everything out of life even in your personal prayer time he uses fear to keep you from being all that you are called to be fear well i'm not afraid sure a lot of us are we may not even recognize this fear not that we're sitting there trembling in fear but we're afraid he won't forgive us we're afraid he won't heal us you're afraid maybe i've crossed the line you're afraid maybe i've gone too far you're afraid to let go in worship you're afraid maybe of what people will think and listen for some people maybe it's just passing thoughts and it was not even a hindrance but for some people fear is crippling for some people it grabs a whole tone and it brings them down and it's nothing more this morning i want you to recognize it's nothing more than a bluff fear is nothing more that's why bullies use fear they don't want to fight nobody either so they use fear and they bluff them and they bluff them and i'm going to do this to you i'ma hit you in the eye and i'm going to take this from you and i'm going to do this i'm going to do this but if you ever want look i'm a middle school teacher i've seen it too many times when that little kid just gets tired of it and the bully's twisting his arm twisting his arm he gets tired of it and bam and it's over the bully's done nobody fears him anymore because they see he was a bluff all along he didn't want to fight it's time some of us get tired of it this morning you won't twist my arm anymore you won't hold me hostage anymore but today bam i'm gonna put one on because i'm not afraid of you your fear is nothing but a bluff it's nothing but a bluff and he can't hold you it's time those of you that have dealt with fear whether you call it fear or panic attacks or anxiety or whatever you want to call it it's time you look that thing in the eye and say yeah i'm not afraid of you you can't hold me you can't stop me the prison door is open and i'm walking out and i will not fear fear is broken fear is broken he can't hold you any longer we give it so many fancy names it's an anxiety it says no it's a devil it's a devil and it's subject to the word of the lord it's subject to your word if you take his word upon your lips it's subject take control of that i am no longer a slave to fear i've recognized my opportunity oh brother aaron what about what about people that are fearful talk like that what about what about the trials i'm gonna face what about when this happens to my family what about and the whole time you're walking right back towards that jail cell and you walk into it and you shut the door he got me out he didn't get you you walked back what about what about when my family has troubles what about let me tell you how that's all going to turn out what about when trials come what about when the waters rise what about when the fire comes he'll raise a standard there'll be a fourth man his word declares you have nothing to fear what about here's how it turns out isaiah 43 and 1 but now thus saith the lord that created thee he's talking to you oh jacob and he that formed thee o israel fear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by name thou art mine when thou passes through the waters what about the waters i will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walkest through the fire thou shalt not be burned neither shall the flame kindle upon thee what is there to fear he said thou art mine and he said i won't lose the one that the father do i need to start over from the beginning how long nope you have nothing to fear the fire will not kindle upon them listen they didn't even get a little bit damp when they crossed the red sea they walked across on dry land so you're not just going to get through this trial you're going to walk as if it's just the most perfect road it's going to be paved with perfection you're not even gonna get your feet muddy you're walking through on dry land because when he does something he does it right when god moves he moves when god says it's your time it's your time now the only thing that can hinder it is if you let something steal your opportunity if you'll take your eyes off the wind and take your eyes off the waves and get your eyes up on jesus and say lord i perish save me i can guarantee you right now he will reach down through hell he will reach down through sickness he will reach down through torment and spirits he will reach down through every twist and everything you can think of and he will pull you from those waters he will pull you from those waters recognize who he is this morning we are a people who have recognized his presence a message came and made us god conscious and his presence doesn't cause us to hide his presence brings us victory before adam fell the voice of god was a daily occurrence to man his presence was expected every day as he would come and walk in the garden he would fellowship with his children he says now in the beginning when god come down in the evening and talk to adam and eve in the core of the day and his grace great voice whispered to them and they had fellowship oh they love one another how the moving of the spirit went through the bushes the lines would come up the tigers all of them and they worship the lord man was conscious at all times that his presence was with him but the fall separated man from that consciousness now bear with me as i go through this next part it says now god when he made man in the beginning he made him superior to anything on earth he gave him the jurisdiction of everything on earth to control everything he controlled the animal life he controlled the foul life the fishes of the sea he controlled the winds he controlled the plant life he controlled everything that was adam he could speak to the trees and they would obey him he could speak to the wildlife it would obey him he could speak to the waters ever what it was everything obeyed adam now that was the beginning of man that's what god give him power over everything on the earth now though the fall through the fall he lost that power then he become unconscious of the fact after losing his relationship and friendship and fellowship with the father then he lost that and all of these great channels become clogged up and he couldn't get through now what adam was in god christ has redeemed us back to that now a redeemer to redeem anything is to bring it back to its origin again now when man fell he lost this and now what he lost in the fall christ come as a redeemer did you ever stop to think what christ redeemed us for he gave us everlasting life he brought us back to the eternal fellowship in relationship to god to be his sons and daughters again to restore back all that adam lost in the fall now the thing of it is since he was restored man back to his place man in the fall has lost his conscience of what father put him here on earth to do in other words all the plumbing as it was in our brain in the outlets the faith has been clogged up with business affairs with home life with domestic things it's all become so clogged clogged up with that until god can't operate through those channels that he made man for now when god made the human body every little part had its place to play the teeth the tongue the eyes the nose god does everything in there to make it perfect in operation to make the man to live and if god so patterned the man the body of a man how much more has he patterned and set in order the body of his church and he's designed us to come together in heavenly places in christ jesus now here we go listen and have these supernatural workings of god outlets through gifts of the spirit such as prophecy and wisdom and knowledge and gifts of healing and all these other different gifts is outlets that god lets out his power and lets out his revelation to the people now satan by the laws of sin and death makes everything that sin and death bought operate and so satan sends a cancer and man recognizes it satan sends a cancer and man recognize it and receives it satan sends heartaches we recognize it and receive it and if satan by his power can make his laws work in man how much more ought god with his power make his laws work in man if satan can make his laws be sure and us recognize it if satan can make you recognize his laws how much more of god to his children make his laws be recognized among us he'd be recognized among the people divine healing revelation power gifts manifestations of the spirit the law of sin and death works in the people and the law of liberty of christ has come unto us to set us free from those things so i believe with all my heart i believe we're nearing the age when people are going to recognize these things we live in a world that recognizes satan we live in a world that recognizes evil it recognizes heartache it recognizes cancer it recognizes everything the devil can put on and it brings fear upon people's life but what about what god said what about recognizing his promise what about recognizing his power recognizing his authority recognizing your ability to speak and take god at his word and be victorious over every law of satan over every law of death you have that authority but you got to recognize it that's always been the battle since the fall and that has been man's failure recognizing what god did pointing to what he's going to do and failing to see where he's moving at right now failing to see how he's operating right now in our midst failing to recognize that he's an ever-present on-time god who's working right now the first age the first age didn't fail to recognize it the first age fresh off the outpouring at the day of pentecost experienced a great awakening of the supernatural men and women had supernatural experiences they were filled with the baptism of the holy ghost miracles were a common thing the supernatural actually became very natural to them it became what they expected the miraculous is how they lived the miraculous is what they saw and so when something moved they didn't miss it because they were in tune in it the problem is so many of us live outside the spirit and presence of god that we can't recognize the presence of god when it comes our way what's that well i don't know you should have recognized it yesterday in your home too we've gotten so far away from it but that first age they were easy to recognize because miracles were a common thing supernatural was natural seeing god move is what they expected because the kinsmen redeemer had come and closed that chasm back between god and man the kinsmen redeemer had come and paid the price and hit everything adam lost he had redeemed back to man and that chasm had been closed but once again satan would try to steal these things away down through the ages by burying them behind creeds burying them behind dogmas burying them behind church denominations and you got to be a part of this and you got to be a part of that and in the name of religion the power of god was stripped away from the people in the name of religion it was stripped away and taken away and once again you saw a church go into a deep dark slumber you saw a church go to sleep unaware of the supernatural moving of god unconscious of what he was capable to do but let me tell you something you may be unconscious this morning but this is a determined god he's not going to leave you unconscious he's not going to leave you sitting where you're sitting he's coming by your way this morning and he's telling you wake up wake up i'm here wake up i'm moving he's not going to leave that particle out there asleep but the angel lord's shaking him right now in the pool in the pigpen saying wake up it's time to go home wake up he's not going to leave you unconscious he's a determined god he will have a bride he will have a people who recognize him he's not going to have a people just come strolling in we will be victorious over every sin victorious over every spirit we will go in victorious because he is determined you will he's not going to let you slumber he's not going to let you sleep he's saying wake up evening like tamara and i go wake up little bride the bridegroom cometh wake up wake up it's time to arise from your slumber you can't stay asleep you can't sit on the few sleeping you can't sleep through everyday life and not recognize my god is here and he's here for me he's determined and so once again he began to stir a sleeping church luther in the age of reformation wesley in the philadelphia age and we know that wesley was a key figure in the movement of the 1730s and 40s known in the 13 colonies as the great awakening down through the early years of colonial america you had the first and you had the second great awakening and what this was was fervency for the things of god once again burned in man's conscience where secularism had come and the world had strayed away now once again there was a renewed fervency people began to look back to god began to seek god once again it was a it was an awakening then move forward into this day in the early 1900s you had the azusa street and people once again became aware of the gifts of the spirit the moving of the presence of god and then an angel visits a prophet he goes forth with a gift of divine healing a great message is delivered in the coming years of ministry and a bride begins to awaken out of her slumber there begins to become a people waking up and realizing i ain't part of this world i ain't a part of this burning i'm not a part of this system there's something that's called me out come out of her come out of her and it begins to ring in the hearts of individuals and he's not dealing with this specific denomination or this specific that hey there's wonderful people there what we got to remember is god deals with individuals he doesn't deal with churches let me tell you right now you can look at how you want i don't look at it that god is dealing with even like tabernacle this morning i look at it like he's dealing with you and he's dealing with you and he's dealing with you and he's dealing with you and dealing with you because he's not taking even like tabernacle in a rapture he's taking you in a rapture he's taking you in a rapture he's taken individuals in a rapture so he deals with people individually and this message came and it began to awaken people's hearts to the reality of god and abroad began to rise out of slumber the church had slumbered for ages and different movements and brought different types of awakenings but this was an awakening greater than any other as a bride began to be called out and made aware of the presence of her bridegroom awakening that awakening means the act of awakening from sleep a revival of interest or attention a recognition a realization or a coming into an awareness of something the bride was called to awake and to rise out of the slumber of dark denominationalism prophet would say now a few years ago when i started there was none of that going on and the only thing that this has done and this supernatural has awakened ministers out of the sense bound realm into a place where they can see god is present but the problem was even though there was nothing wrong with the message there was nothing wrong with the movement there was nothing wrong with any of that but so many people failed to realize who it was that was really here so many people failed to realize who it was that was being revealed they failed to realize who it was that had come to bring a message listen it was the mighty angel it was the lord jesus christ it was the pillar of fire that led israel it was the pillar of fire that meant paul that's who came to reveal this but says so many people fail to recognize this they fail to recognize this presence oh they recognize the prophet even the nominal world would declare in their magazines bible days are here again bible days not since the days of jesus have things but they recognized the prophet but they didn't recognize who was being revealed who was the prophet pointing to this wasn't about a man this isn't man worship he was pointing to something he was pointing to someone he was trying to wake you up to the fact jesus christ is here jesus is here who is it healing your children who is it delivering you who is it saving you who is it you must have it's jesus jesus is here he's the one moving recognized recognized this morning he was pointing to jesus but then the prophets taken off the scene and many believe those things were finished i don't mean to be rude but wrong wrong the message was to show that when he's present he jesus christ you can take the word and you can put it on your lips and you can speak and it's the same as deity speaking if you have the faith of a grain of mustard seed you say you say you say you don't need your favorite preacher up here all right otherwise we'd all be in trouble this morning you need jesus that's who's here that's who's speaking recognize it's him take the word on your lips and stand to what the message we're trying to get you to recognize who you are and your relationship to the one who is present now so the prophets taken off the scene they believed all that was finished and they weren't conscious that william branham never once pointed to himself he pointed to the lord jesus christ and i'm telling you this morning that jesus christ is here in this building he promised he would be i don't feel it brother aaron i'm not worried about that the word said he would be here the word said he would be here and so i'm telling this one that he is here and we must be god conscious we must be aware that he is in our midst we must recognize our opportunities we must act while we have the chance we must seize the moment we must seize the day but many are slumbering in this time where man says god has delayed his coming many say god has delayed his coming and so they are slumbering once again they're slumbering and yet he is passing by this moment and yet you must be aware and you must wake up his presence passing by listen you don't receive your blessing just by him passing by stop for a minute you do not receive a blessing just because he comes into this building just because he comes into your car just because he comes into your home look he's passed by many that receive nothing he's passed by many that turned him down he's passed by many that never recognized him you must recognize his presence and grab hold you must recognize you're in the presence of the king of kings i hear a prophet discerning sicknesses and i hear him discerning people's hearts and then i hear him calling and telling a person her name her address when he goes he says oh god she's going to miss it oh god she's missing it don't let her miss it and then he turns to someone he says she missed it but you got it it was her opportunity in his presence it passed by the angel lord passed by and she didn't recognize he can call our name sometimes and we don't recognize call our name tell you your problem it's discerned right from the pulpit the preacher's preaching you're going how's he know that but who told him who told him about that does anybody need to tell our god why do we come to church if we're not expecting the supernatural if we're not expecting him to move why are you here you could have gathered together anywhere read the bible and sang a song why do we gather together what is it we're looking for him to move him to speak and if you're constantly putting everything off that happens and something else there's some coincidence you missing moving and you miss your opportunity it's not just him moving you got to recognize it you gotta grab it we must be aware today we have to be conscious we have to wake up you're saying that a lot brother and i'm gonna keep saying it a lot that's what this is about today wake up recognize your opportunity wake up he's in the building wake up he's here in the last age wake up the bride's fisting to take a rapture wake up you don't want to miss it don't be found without oil in your lap don't be found without all in your lap wake up now's the time to get it now's the time to get it now's the time to get it look the sleeping virgins knew they needed oil they recognized that but they waited too late to get it they said today is the day to go get it and while they were gone he came and they were left behind wake up to the hour wake up to the moment it's going home time get your laps drilled get the oil in get your family sealed get serious about it it's time to go home church we must stay in contact with the supernatural whether it's booming out like it did here on wednesday night what a wonderful time whether it's booming out like it was here on wednesday night or whether it's that quiet unction of the holy ghost that moves on your heart at midday on a thursday and says call that brother call that sister or moves on your heart tomorrow and you feel to go to prayer for that friend that you haven't even spoke to in a couple weeks or months those things are supernatural we fail to realize them because the world is boom boom boom right and we miss the small we've lost contact with the unction church we got to be in contact with that aren't you because one of these mornings you're going to wake up and there's going to be an unction that says it's time to go it's time to go was that just me was that just my thinking i don't want to be the one sitting around debating i did i just think that well no there's going to be an auction that says it's rapture day it's going home time and i want to be so in contact with that spirit that when he that led us will let be taken out of the way that i can go with him when that spirit begins to rise up off the earth i'm in contact with that supernatural and i go with it as it rises up maybe even recognize when it's the preacher preaching he repeats conversations you've had in private or maybe he speaks directly to your heart about a sin question in your life however he moves however he moves we must be a people in tune with it that recognize it and we don't let the moment pass us by unaware i've been there i've been there when the lord moves and you know you're supposed to do something and you hesitate a moment it's gone there's not hardly a worse feeling he moves on you you hesitate because you think within the flesh should i yeah what it's over he's moved on when he moves on your heart move with it when he moves on your heart you go he says dance you dance he says shout you shout he says pray for that brother you pray for that brother he asked you go here go there you do it move in the unction of the holy spirit but some of us have gotten so far away from it that we don't recognize it anymore and we see others move in that option and go so emotional so emotional somebody doesn't recognize what god did for him and somebody does somebody's missing an opportunity somebody's receiving theirs don't be one sitting on the outside watching others get their opportunity or one day you're gonna watch others get a new body get in touch with the supernatural listen the body changes the most supernatural thing there is i'm not so sure about the supernatural well then you're not going to rapture because if you can tell me something more supernatural than a rapture and me getting a brand new body and this body being healthy in this body looking good or whatever you want to say that's supernatural [Music] if you can't recognize the supernatural you'll never recognize a rapture this message is supernatural we can't continue to push every supernatural thing off and chalk it up to coincidence or somebody told him or that's just my feelings or that's just emotion listen that's a supernatural god he's a supernatural god who does supernatural things and move in supernatural ways which is beyond our comprehending it's beyond our minds and and even more than that it's not just that he wants us to believe the supernatural when we see it he wants us to expect the supernatural before we see it he wants us to come with an expectation listen i loved wednesday night it's one of the most powerful services i've ever been in thank you jesus but i expect to see him move on sunday i need him to move today i expect salvation today i expect healing today i expect deliverance today i expect to see him in this service today because he is an i am god he is ever present for your needs i loved wednesday it was phenomenal but i say lord give me a little bit more of that pour your spirit out on me a little more today i need you lord i need it today i'm looking for his presence today and even if he doesn't come the way i want him to or expect him to that doesn't mean he didn't come so i'm looking with an open mind lord how are you going to move today how are you going to speak today who are you going to pour yourself out on today lord i'm willing i'm looking i'm able so many people well i don't have any gifts i don't have to get to speak in tongues i don't have the gift to interpret i don't have this gift i don't have that how do you know you've never once lent yourself over to him and surrendered 100 to allow him to work through you how many gifts are hidden behind that's not my personality how many gifts are hidden behind that's just not in my nature that's why we preach a nature change that's why we preach a nature change that's just not my nature so you try and tell me that every single person that gets up and runs around this building just loves running because that's fun it's people that recognize his presence it's people that recognize his presence well they may not have got that might have been just emotional okay when jesus comes by i get emotional when jesus is in the building i get emotional brother branham said where jesus is there's lots of noise because people recognize he's in their presence people recognize it and i may not be perfect i may not have everything right but when my king walks in the door when my jesus walks in the door when my god walks in the door i'm gonna praise him i'm gonna shout i'm gonna dance i'm gonna worship i'm gonna give him everything because he deserves it he deserves it he deserves it hallelujah he deserves your praise and your worship so give him all of it give him all of it let me tell you what if all you can do is not nod with enthusiasm give him all of it let loose come on church he is here he's in the building his presence hallelujah i said hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord for there is none like you in heaven and earth there is none like you you are my king and my savior and my lord and i worship you oh i'm reminded what brother doug baker said he said if you're going to be a tear instead of a wheat at least be a biblical tear because tares raised their hand in worship [Applause] least be biblical what do we believe anyway if you don't believe in the supernatural and you don't believe in the movement of the spirit you don't believe this [Applause] message we must be conscious of the supernatural all the time sure we love it when he comes and we can feel it there's nothing like it there's no feeling better than the presence of god but what about when you don't feel it does that mean he ain't there are you aware of it are you awake to it are you conscious of it we gotta learn to recognize him every day all around us recognize him in your blessings recognize him in this service even if you don't feel it because he said he'd be here live in that presence so you can recognize that presence prophet god says five senses that we live in that's just a little world of our own but god we was only given these so we could contact our earthly home but there is senses beyond that another dimension and god is always present if we can only remember that the angels of the lord are encamped about those who fear him in this building tonight stands jesus christ that's enough right there in this building tonight stands jesus christ in this building tonight as host of angels thousands of them gathered around you don't see them but you can feel the influence of them telling you that they are here jesus christ is here present if we would be conscious of that and remember not only here but when you're walking down the street wherever you are you that profess to be believers and fear the lord remember the angels of god are moving with you wherever you are they watch everything you do every thought that goes through your mind they know all about you therefore we must be conscious of that talking about feeling and seeing and only believing when we can see things brother branham speaking here about gaheza and elijah talking about being aware and being god conscious and how they were surrounded by the assyrians and he said just the same tonight i wonder what would happen if a man here tonight had the power to strike across your eyes and say look standing around this tabernacle tonight you'd be a member here the rest of your life yes sir sometimes you can't see it with your natural eyes but you can feel the impulse of it something near a sixth sense that denotes something is near watch him this morning opening the deaf ears making the polio cripples walk around here like there was nothing wrong with them what is it it's the it's the sixth sense that's conscious the spirit that something is near now it goes back to talking about elijah and geheza and he says now he didn't see that at first talking about gehesa elijah probably didn't see it but he asked for the boy's eyes to see it but elisha was just conscious that they were there that prophet didn't have to see it that prophet had experienced enough he had been there enough he was aware of their presence but he knew gahesa needed that faith lifted up he needed his eyes to be opened so that he could believe prophet god said elisha didn't see it he didn't need to see it he was god conscious he was awake to his presence he was awake to the supernatural he was aware that god was with them in every situation brother and you mean we need to believe it when we see it well that's good if you do i'd rather you not be a skeptic when you see it sure believe it when you see it but what i mean is believe he's here and respond to him when you don't see it respond to him when you don't feel it be conscious of the supernatural conscious of his presence aware that he's in the build nowhere that he's working but i don't see it he's working i don't feel it he's working i'm telling you today he's working whether you see it whether you feel it whether you're here just get ready to kill the fatted calf the protocols are coming home the healings are taking place the deliverances are happening prison bars are being opened let me tell you what i don't feel it it's okay he's working i don't see it it's okay i'm aware of the supernatural i'm conscious that he's here and he's working in this building today we must be in constant expectation for the supernatural we want to be expecting his presence to sweep through like it did wednesdays that means going to every time maybe not like that but it's going to be here and i want to expect it to be here and i want to look for it look this message made many people aware of the supernatural made many people aware of his presence but it's like they hit the snooze button if the alarm went off and looked at it's kind of conscious from it they went look an alarm goes off to wake you up and you're aware for a moment of what's going on and what's happening now i know not everybody's the same but i'm such a deep sleeper but y'all go ahead and laugh it's fine i know this is odd but the alarm's on my white side of the bed because if it's on my side of bed i'd have been fired a long time ago because i don't come conscious easy i'll turn it off i'll unplug it and i wake up 9 30. i can't lie in church so i'm just being honest i don't wake up easy so my wife kicks me repeatedly [Applause] i don't i'm not sure but i think she finds joy in that she kicks me repeatedly till i finally say okay i'm up no you're not you might be awake but you ain't up and if i quit kicking you you can go right back to sleep and some people i know we all wake up a little bit different my dad will tell you he used to have to wake me up for school and he'd come sit on the staircase next to my bed he found joy in this i know and he would say my name over and over and over in the most monotonous repetitive tone it he didn't care if it took five minutes he knew i was irritated he'd sit there on the bed and go aaron aaron aaron aaron until i finally listen why are you still preaching that same message why are you still preaching the holy ghost why are you still preaching supernatural getting on my nerves i don't care about your nerves i need you to wake up wake up he's here wake up he's here wake up he's here wake up he's here wake up he's here the alarm clock got one job wake you up wake up he's here wake up he's here i'm tired of hearing it wake up he's here wake up got one job wake him up he's here oh sure we wake up for a little bit we hit the snooze button go back to sleep then another meeting comes or wednesday night comes and it stirs us and we're awake for the supernatural but then on thursday back down we go we didn't wake up if you keep hitting snooze too often the rapture is going to come during a snooze your opportunity's gonna come during the snooze yeah you wake up but you're late you wake up but the door closed you wake up but you missed it because you snoozed one too many times why does that alarm keep going off why are you preaching right here this is shallow i've been hearing this for 20 years always preaching deliverance well you didn't have a problem with deliverance when you was the one that needed it and apparently you need it again and not everybody's where you claim to be some people's just starting they need it and like i said so do you i bet you're one of them people that didn't like the 11th hour worker not everybody starts at the same time wake up you actually think you've gotten up you actually think you're have you ever dreamed you got up that's what happened with a lot of people with this message they heard it oh they're awake i think they're white but you're laying there and you think you're awake you're going through all the motions are you standing there brushing your teeth and all sudden alarm goes off and you're still laying in the bed huh how'd that happen you thought you woke up you thought you moved but you wasn't conscious it startled you i'm just gonna let here a few more minutes i'm awake i'm good so many thoughts they're waiting at their sleep sound asleep in their correct doctrine unaware of his presence sound asleep in their manufactured holiness sound asleep in their work sound asleep in their worship because they heard an alarm go off and they think they're awake and they're totally unaware that he's moving not recognizing his presence right among them the most supernatural message to ever strike the earth is become a religion to him just a religion just a covering this is what i do and in that stupor everything outside that comfort zone because you're in a stupor and you're comfortable and you're under that blanket and you see the evil in the world and so you snuggle down under that blanket a little bit more it's like hearing the robber break in and crawling on your blanket thing's going to protect you see you snuggle down a little bit more so bad out there let me get in my religion let me listen to another tape that's good you should you better get jesus you better find him you better wake up to the fact that he's here you better wake up to the fact that he won't be here much longer so you're in a stupor and everything outside that comfort zone is just talked up to that's just pentecostal that's just emotion was that really a healing and didn't the doctors play a big part in that was that really a healing was that really a deliverance oh this testimony again how many times uh until you wake up oh this testimony again oh but then a stirring will come like wednesday night and it wakes you up church if that didn't wake you up wednesday night i believe even like tabernacles should be wide awake right now i believe you're awake to the supernatural what am i telling you don't snooze it don't snooze it today don't hit snooze don't go back to your comfort zone stay out listen there's an old saying that life begins where your comfort zone ends life begins where your comfort zone ends so quit sitting there in a state of death every service and stay outside that comfort zone stay in that place of worship stay in that place of recognizing stay in that place where the holy spirit can move are you trying to dictate how i worship no i'm just telling you to worship i'm just telling you to worship i don't care how you worship i'm just asking you to be willing to worship when he comes in the building some people if they ask you hey where do you worship if you told them even like tabernacle you'd be lying might be where you go to church lord help me move on stay alert so that you never fail to miss him moving it takes a stirring to be pulled from a slumber and when you're asleep you don't like a stirring nobody does we don't like to be stirred when we're comfortable but i say today lord stir us up stir us up a little bit this morning lord make us aware brother brown says i feel real good about it anyhow what this church needs today is a good revival not a new doctrine a new order just a stirring up of what you already know about he says oh brother what we need today is an old stern of the holy ghost again brother if it had to come to me but it had to come to me before god ever manifested himself we need another rushing mighty wind scent that's right as it did on the day of pentecost they were all religious and they were all followers of jesus but they had to go and receive the baptism of the holy ghost is that true they never done like the baptists do and shake hands and put their name on the book and say yes i'm born again they didn't have it like that there's not a scripture is that in the whole bible and then the catholics come out and they stick out their tongue take the holy eucharist and say we got the holy ghost ain't no scripture like that in the bible we methodists go on prohibition for six months and there's no such scripture in the bible for that and listen they didn't also just say well i recognize john the baptist was the forerunner that didn't do it for him either they didn't say i recognize that malachi 4 has come god sent a prophet that didn't do it for him either what did it the bible said when the day of pentecost was fully come there came a sound from heaven like a rushing mighty wind and it filled the house where they were sitting and the power of god so enclosed those people and anointing them until they run out in the streets screaming dancing hollering acting like a bunch of drunk people that's the scripture that's just saith the lord that thus saith the lord that's how he comes that's how a stirring happens that's how he moves and yet some people just can't recognize it they can't recognize him he says what we need today is a stirring hallelujah god shook america with signs and wonders and you're without excuse the holy ghost has been preached the blind obscene the dead's been raised up thousands of prostitutes and drunkards have been brought to the kingdom of god shouting to victory that's right but america looks at it and calls it mental telepathy psychology are worked up i'm just asking you church not to be into one that that category don't look at it and call it something other than what it is the movement of the holy spirit don't look at it and say well they just worked them up they just did it look at it and say thank god you're moving thank god you're in our midst thank god you're pouring your spirit out lord i want to be next lord pour it out on me pour it out on me some of us get so caught up in the ceiling of the holy ghost and yes it is a sealer and if you have it you are sealed but you don't just get the holy ghost and sit back and go when you're coming lord that's not what it's all about but there is refreshing and there is real feelings and there are works to be done and he filled you so you could go out in his name healing the sick demonstrating the gifts laying your hands on the sick preaching the gospel showing that he is a living god and every present god and i am god and he's here today i'm glad he sealed you but so many of us are stuck on that first experience instead of coming today going lord i need an experience today and guess what i'm coming on wednesday saying i need an experience today that i'm coming sunday saying i need an experience today i'm looking every day for his presence because i don't want to miss my opportunity in his presence oh don't be that one that can't recognize him when he moves the eagle's stirring her nest the wind of the holy ghost is moving [Music] if we just dare to set our wings into that wind this morning i believe we might catch it up current i believe that some people would just they've been earthbound so long they've been stuck in the chicken pins so long they forgot them wings work just start dusting them off a little bit start dusting them wings off a little bit just try to set those wings this morning to that wind see if you can't catch enough current see if you can catch an upcurrent to heavenly places where all things are possible well you forget about what other people are saying when you forget about what's going on in the world when you forget about politics and news and this and coveness and whatever name whatever it is that's been distracting you catching up current this morning fly away from those things this morning i'll tell you what if that if i can't get you that high yet just jump up on the fence post this morning come on just jump up on the fence posted that pin that's got you pinned in jump up there look the world put you inside of a pen and said this is how you got to live this is the condition you got to live in this is what you are these are your problems this is what you gotta eat this is your sickness but something about that don't sit right with me because i ain't an earthbound chicken i am a flying eagle and i ain't gonna be told by the devil i gotta stay in no pen i'm gonna be told by the devil i gotta stay in no prison i ain't going to eat his junk i ain't have to shove down my throat i'm not going to be walking around bearing his sickness in my body i was made free i'd just jump up on the fence coast this morning jump up on the fence post this morning just let the wind blow and all of a sudden you hear an eagle scream come up higher come up higher let me tell you what you know the difference you're glory to god just jump up on the fence jump up on the fifth post and go this morning just jump up on the fence coach and go this morning just let him have his way blessed be the name of the lord oh hallelujah i feel good let me tell the devil one more time i'm healed i'm here i feel good i'm having a good time i can't help it listen jump up on that fence post this morning you know the difference between that eagle and those chickens you know those in the same church service they heard the exact same message they heard the exact same eagle scream but there's something different about that eagle he recognized it for what it was it was papa god it was papa god talking to him that he's in the same service chicken said what's all that noise i'm trying to eat my worms what's all that noise all that running about and shouting i can't feed when you're that loud i can't even hear what the preacher's saying when you get to shout when you get the holler and i'm trying to eat my worms why are you so excited quit flapping your wings you're making it dusty in here i'm sorry to bother you mr chicken but i'm getting ready to fly i'm getting ready to fly i heard from my father and he said the devil ain't got a fence high enough to keep me in he ain't got a fence high enough to keep this bird changed i'm jumping up on the fifth post i'm setting my rings in that occurrence [Music] yes sir hallelujah i got up on that fence post and i said my wings and i caught enough current and then that chicken said never mind i didn't hear what he said i was gone i didn't hear what the chicken said no more i was in the heavenlies i would gather together with god's people in heavenly places i was worshipping i was praising because i recognized he was in the building hallelujah listen to a prophet he says we need another jump we got to the barnyard post but we need to get free so we can just ride on his wings for our first solo flight we just saw a brother take a solo flight he got off that post he took him a little flight this morning what a joy it will be when that great final day comes now this one right here this might be hard for some folks that those who know how to jump and flop their wings those who know how to do it someday he's going to come the great eagle of the sky will come in glory and we're going to spread forth his great he will spread forth his great power the holy spirit and those who are magnetized to it shall take a ride for eternity forever those who know how to jump those who know how to flap their wings those that are free in the spirit those who recognize his movement he's going to come over one day and it ain't just going to be a jump or a flock but the wind of the holy ghost i think i hear it now it sounds like a russian mighty wind if somebody would just set their wings to it all things are possible your healing's possible your deliverance is possible your freedom's possible set your wings in the spirit in the presence of almighty god hallelujah so we preach the supernatural back to why do we preach i just made it back why are you always preaching that that's why we preach the supernatural we preach the miraculous because where jesus is there will always be the supernatural satan always attacks it tries to bring doubt tries to get you to look to the carnal and person is there carnal impersonation absolutely janice and jamborees were there and so many people got caught up on the what janice and jamborees did you know i was just reading in jewish literature this week that only one out of five israelites left egypt in the exodus one out of five the others didn't recognize their need for a deliverance they didn't recognize the supernatural because they said she's emotional now that which is perfect has come we don't need i mean moses your gift ain't that special look these magicians just did it and they got caught up in those things and they missed their need for deliverance they were so comfortable where they were they stayed in their comfort zone but his children recognized his children recognized prophet god says many people are great lovers of god how many here's a lover of god i believe we all are great lovers of god raised up under the church they believe their church that's right they believe god but as far as the supernatural being operated in a human being today that's beyond anything they could ever swallow but that's where the truth is that's where the truth is that's the truth as god is my supreme judge that's where the truth lays i tell you i'm not criticizing the baptist baptist people fundamentally they know what they're talking about as long as it comes to the word but they know nothing about the supernatural and my brethren that's where they're missing the blessing you miss the blessing when you're not aware of the supernatural or you don't recognize and we begin to lose touch with that realm when the supernatural isn't preached when his presence isn't recognized we end up with dead people dead pews dead homes and a people destined to do nothing but perpetuate the ages but when a people begin to recognize oh he's here oh he's in the building oh my god is ever present then you start to see victories you start to see shout and you start to see dance and you start to see satan tore down you start to see people overcoming when they recognize who it is whose presence that they're in when they're conscious of it those are a people that's going to take a rapture they're not destined to perpetuate the ages they're not destined to go down they are the group that was seen going up they are the group that when he lives they will live with them because they've recognized whose presence they are in so we can't slumber church we can't go back to sleep we've been awakened sure a message awakened us but we've been awakened by the preaching of the word over and over and that message is still awakened us and his presence is still awakening us and we got to stay awake don't make the alarm clock keep going just get up he's here he's telling you to rise and shine he's telling you that light has come he's telling you that healing has come now salvation has come thy rapture has come he's telling you and we can't go back to sleep we got to keep expecting why did that outbreak happen in oklahoma last week because a group of young people gathered expecting it to happen they went knowing what was going on you should have heard them talking no they couldn't wait they knew god was going to move they knew they were going to be delivered they knew the gifts were going to be displayed they knew he was going to move in what happened he never disappoints he always shows up exactly where he's invited and he usually goes above and beyond what you even expect so they received one of the most greatest outpourings the most wonderful youth camps it was phenomenal i would watch it and just weep watching those people get delivered in the freedom in the spirit it was incredible how did it happen wednesday night look there was people that was supposed to be leaving going to oklahoma on wednesday for the wedding and they all decided i will wait and leave thursday because they knew something was going to happen there was expectations of what was going to take place and when we come with those expectations looking for his presence recognizing his presence then you don't miss it when those things take place you don't miss it when he begins to move you don't miss your blessing people came expecting god to move don't miss it when he moves look at blind bartimaeus we read about him at the beginning how is it that we can see so much that we can witness so much and yet miss him when he moves and yet blind bartimaeus sitting there prophet tells all about it how he had already made it past him and he thought oh no i missed him but then he thought if that's the son of david he'll hear me he'll hear me and so bartimaeus begins to crowd and it says he began to cry out and say jesus thou son of david have mercy on me and this is my favorite part of the whole thing if you know the truth and many charged him that she he should hold his peace but he cried out the more a great deal y'all just need to sit down up and even like tabernacle y'all getting too emotional at any like time you ain't seen nothing yet just try to sit me down just try to stop my praise just try to stop me from worshiping i'm gonna cry out all the more our son of david have mercy on me now son of david we need you we accept you we recognize you oh lord jesus move in our midst you get a little bit loud i can get louder move in this place today cry out all the more oh man what happened when he cried out he says jesus stood still oh somebody could stop him in his tracks this morning somebody just gave him to stop and they said be of good cheer he calleth you be a good cheer even like tabernacle not only is he here he's calling your name this morning not always here he's saying what do you have need of what wilt thou that i do unto thee i take it right now my lips not speak it lord this is what i need today this is what i need you to do i would take the opportunity in his presence to say lord this is what i need right now because he stopped for a moment he stopped from which way is he going to go to those that are calling out to him to those that are recognizing who he is he's stopping for just a moment oh how did the blind man recognize him others had seen the miracles others had witnessed what he's done and yet they were still critical in his presence mind reader sue sayer deceiver they're calling out but one in the midst of all that says son of david son of david all y'all are emotional just caught up in emotions somebody's gonna say oh son of david come by my way they were critical in his presence they wanted to quiet down the service a little bit they showed up every sunday every wednesday they knew the message they knew the prophecies they'd seen the miracles but they still weren't a fan of all that shouting they still weren't a fan of all that dancing they still questioned whether that was god or just an emotional girl caught up for just a minute they still chalked up that dancing and that praising to that personality well that's just her person let me ask you who's really blind who was the blind one there on that road it wasn't bartimaeus oh it wasn't bartimaeus he recognized he saw he recognized in that moment who's the blind one in a church service when he moves and he speaks and there's deliverance and there's joy who's the blind one who's the blind one sitting there the one who threw rotten vegetables at jesus called them beelzebub or the one who recognized he was passing by the one who recognized the lateness of the hour the one who recognized this might be my last chance can't you see who's passing by this moment can't you see who's in the building right now amongst us how many people throughout the bible were in jesus presence and yet never recognized it never or maybe they recognize it and yet never recognize their need of him look there's deliverance there's healing there's salvation there's victory there's everything you have need of in this building right now today but you got to recognize it's here and then you got to recognize you need it you can recognize it's here but if you don't recognize your need of it it's not going to do you any good you got to humble yourself to recognize your need look you can't just come to church fulfilling a duty this is what we do we go to church sunday we go to church wednesday because when it becomes a duty then you fail to see it as an opportunity you fail to see it as an opportunity i'm just going to be honest i don't wake up on monday morning and go i have an opportunity to go to work today maybe i should a good job's a blessing i get that but i'm just being honest but how many of us wake up on sunday morning feeling the same way we do about going to work on monday morning well we got to go to church today no you don't got to go to church today this is an opportunity this is an opportunity to be in the presence of the creator of all things the one who created your soul and died for you and heals the blind and heals your sickness and say this is an opportunity it can't become a duty it can't be all we got to because then you fail to come with proper expectations look i come to church expecting wonderful things i don't ever wake up and go to work and go this is going to be the best day ever but i do feel that way when i come to church because i know whose presence i'm visiting to walk into i know what is fits in the half and not what might happen what's fixing to happen because where he is the supernatural is present i'm not talking about believing he's present believing the supernatural when you actually see it i'm talking about coming to church with no doubt we're going to see god move today we're going to see god move today i'm talking about showing up on wednesday nights with the same expectation you show up at our easter meetings for show up wednesday night with the same expert i've heard a lot and i'm with you can't wait till easter can't wait till easter i can't wait till right now i can't wait for this moment right now cause he's here and then i can't wait for wednesday and i can't wait for sunday and i can't wait to gather with his people in his presence and then when i get to easter it's going to be amazing but it's amazing right now in his presence how do we come to church i come to church saying he's going to be there he's going to be there i get to worship him i get to praise him i have needs that will be met it's going to be wonderful today in his presence it's going to be amazing in his presence but when it's just our duty kids get ready if we leave now we can get there before the song service ends yeah i know harry it's a duty it's become a duty it's just become a religion we become so focused on our duty that we actually miss him brother branham talks about a courier that brought the message to jesus to tell him he was invited to the pharisees house he said that runner was just doing his duty it was nothing more to him it wasn't seen as an opportunity to him he came to service because he was told to he was in the very presence of jesus church he had an audience with the savior he says people are not conscious of it they see the scriptures exactly identified but they're not conscious of who it is they'll see something and say oh that was wonderful that was fine but you're not conscious of what it is if there was if if there would be a rep if you were there would be a repentance going on weeping and crying and we passed by many times and missed the opportunity by not being conscious i don't think the boy realized and he just throwed it off that wasn't nothing but just an ordinary message that he had to deliver he just sat there and he was in his presence and that was all it was to him it didn't mean nothing to him but if he had been conscious if that boy could rise from the dead today and said in this meeting this week he'd have done something about it he'd have a testimony that would have shook us all but he wasn't conscious so many times we don't do that we don't accept the opportunity this courier delivered the message and in the presence of the lord jesus and yet was just stupid enough if i must say it to turn away and think that he had done all that was necessary what an opportunity god gave that man that poor miserable man i wish i could have stood there i'd have fallen down at his feet the first thing before i said anything about what the cardinal wanted i just said lord jesus be merciful to me a sinner that had been the first thing in my life knowing that he was life and the only resource to god was through him oh i think that ought to be the sole duty of every man and woman that attends these meetings regardless of what somebody else said you've been brought into the presence of christ no matter how successful or unsuccessful no matter how great or how poor no matter what you are at the first opportunity fall at his feet and say lord be merciful to me this most miserable man how he would look at him this morning how we would look at him this morning if we could pull back the curtain and see that it was continually his attitude to turn from the presence of christ when he'd had the opportunity to stand by him what a miserable person that is yet today because he lives somewhere and it might be you and it might be i after this meeting it depends on our attitude when we're in his presence but he turned his back upon the lord and walked away feeling relief satisfied that he had done what he was told to do how many times did we leave from a sunday service feeling satisfied because we did what we were supposed to do leave from a wednesday night satisfied because we did what we were supposed to do and yet brother brown says if that boy could come back today what a different testimony he'd have how many times have we had the opportunity to have a different testimony how many times should we have cried out in his presence but it was just another day at church brother brown says friends i'm afraid you're not conscious of what's going on the very god of eternity the god who made the heavens and earth the god that was upon our lord jesus brought him from the dead anointed him and he went about doing good is here in this auditorium in jeffersonville indiana tonight he's here he says i'm afraid you're not conscious of it church we got to be conscious we must be aware of our need from him you must be conscious of your need for him that that wells up even now that you have to recognize your need because your recognition of your need is what will cause you to cry out as he passes by you're responding listen to this your response when his presence is in the building tells how much you think you need him your response when he is in the building shows how much you think you need him look you can know he's great you can know he's present but if you're comfortable sitting right where you're at you're going to watch as nothing more than a spectator as he moves through the building and if you recognize he's in the building and you don't cry out to him you identify yourself as a laodicean who says i don't have a need of you because you see him moving and you sit there and watch i don't have need of you today lord thank you for blessing them thank you for meeting them why aren't you crying out i guess i don't need nothing really in his presence i have need of nothing you must recognize your need we all have need of him on the best day i need him on the worst day i need him i need him every single day we all have need of him look the woman with the blood issue recognized she had need of him she had tried everything else she had spent her money she had been to physicians she was aware that no one else could help her she had tried everything but she came to church that day with the right attitude she came to church that day saying i'm going to touch him i'm going to recognize his presence it doesn't matter what anybody else does today i'm gonna touch him i don't care if you worship the day i'm gonna touch him i don't care if you worship i'm gonna touch him i don't care how the song service goes i'm gonna touch him i don't care if it's the worst special we ever had i'm gonna touch him i don't care if it's the best specials we've ever had i don't care if it's the worst sermon best sermon i'm going to church to touch the jesus christ i'm going to church to touch my savior i'm going to touch him everything told her not to do it circumstances told her not to do it they tried to constrain her but she didn't care she went with the attitude i must touch jesus i must recognize in his presence i recognize he's my healer and i've got to get to him that's got to be her attitude [Music] that's what the kids in oklahoma last week recognized they recognized they recognized what was going on they recognized the king of kings was in the building what was all that jumping shout and praise and they recognized their attitude was i must be set free i must be loose i must have him oh they were that blind bartimaeus they were the woman with the blood issue there was the woman at the well and they said thou son of david have mercy on me oh go ahead put him in the corner i know a group of young people that are worshipping go ahead and sit down on your hands i know a group of young people that ain't scared to praise the king of kings when he comes into a building they've been set free and they've recognized his presence and no matter what happens from this day forward you'll never be able to tell them that god's not real you'll never be able to tell them that the holy spirit don't move you'll never be able to take that away from them they experienced it for themselves well they're young brother aaron you know that's actually the hardest time to break out we put that on them as if that makes it easier for them to do oh well they're young people it's way harder as a young person than as an adult it's not even comparable there's never a time in your life when you're more self-conscious and more worried about what people think than when you're a young person but they didn't care they pushed through [Music] it seems like maybe as young people they're a little bit less jaded than us adults their minds maybe have a little bit less skepticism maybe they've taken in less scars i don't know they seem to be less critical i know that some of the most critical people i've ever been around people has been around the longest so okay so busy picking everything apart so worried about how everybody else is living what everybody else is doing got no grace for nobody so quick to pick apart the ministry for every little flaw and every little failure or pick apart a young person just because they ain't doing everything to exact t like you think they ought to we'll see it was just the motion they stumbled they messed up it was just emotion if they really got something they wouldn't be doing that well look maybe they didn't get everything they needed but what happened was they recognized his presence and they weren't going to miss an opportunity to praise him they weren't going to miss an opportunity to shout they wouldn't miss an opportunity to cry out to him you said it's just a motion well a doctor told that to brother branham one time and he said billy don't you think them people them pentecostal people is just excited i said no sir i don't he said well what makes them that's just nervousness because they scream and holler and go on i said doctor you mean to tell me that the nerves can get excited without something to excite them you mean the nerves can get excited without something to excite them something has to excite them so what's there i said it's the unseen force of the holy ghost moving amongst us it excites that born-again spirit the unseen force of the holy ghost movement amongst us excites that unseen spirit he said it brings excitement and in that same moment while you're sitting there criticizing everybody and everything and wondering if that's even real or if she just got excited again he passed by you and you missed it in your moment of criticism you missed your opportunity and then you go home from church i don't even see what all the fuss was about i don't even like that kid anyway i don't think he's a very good example to our young people and now your family conversation is all about the failures of everybody else and you don't got to the point you don't recognize your need and what a visitation will do for your family and you are unconscious sorry get your eyes off of others and get them back on him get your eyes off of others and get them back on they are not your holy ghost they are not what's going to save you he is let them deal with them and you deal with you and me deal with me and we'll all pull together i believe that we who have been given so many opportunities will be held accountable for our attitude and church services our attitudes and his presence and our attitudes towards others who did recognize his presence recognize him this morning look i don't care if you've been critical he's here for you too i'm not putting you out i'm just saying wake up wake up the alarm's going off time to wake up and realize he's here and when you realize he's here what everybody else is doing no longer matters to you when you realize he's here how everybody's acting no no longer matters to you where he is there is freedom where he is there is victory listen brother aaron i'm having a hard time seeing him i'm having a hard time recognizing where is he get your eyes back on the promise get your eyes off the wind in the ways and you'll see he's right there at the front he's right there at the front leading the charge he never left us he never forsook us he's been there all along and he's right there at the front with the sword drawn and therefore we will win this battle what battle whatever battle you're in that battle with depression that the battle with anxiety that battle for your son that battle for your prodigal that battle for your salvation that battle for the holy ghost that battle for rapture we are going to win because we recognize his presence is in the building we've recognized he's here and we will be victorious we are winners why are you winners because i recognize that he's here this morning i recognized it you can stay standing you can all stand we're about to bring this to a close he's here and we must be conscious of it don't let this church go back into a stupor where we fear cancer don't let this church go back into a stupor where we're unaware of the supernatural remain conscious the world's trying to put you back to sleep and i'm saying remain conscious tries to make you forget how great your god is what was israel saying every time they came up against a new challenge they would fear it and forget the victories that was behind them they would forget that the pillar of fire was in the camp who cares what's right outside the camp he's going before us the pillar of fire is in the camp and they would deem their current situation greater than the god that was with them they would go back into a stupor they became more focused on the red sea than the pillar of fire more focused on the lack of food than on the pillar of fire more focused on the lack of water than on the pillar of fire and here we are we've become so aware of the problems more so than the solution more aware of evil than good more focused on politics than on the message have we forgotten that the pillar of fire is in the camp today church the pillar of fire is amongst us quit elevating your enemy to the status of god in your life quit elevating your problem to the status of god in your life it is not your master it is not your god you are not but my case is different brother aaron my case my cancer my depression would you quit calling it yours it ain't a puppy quit petting that thing my cancer my this my no start turn that around my jesus my god my healer my savior my deliverer he is mine he is my everything that is not my cancer that is not who i am he tried to label me he tried to give me a name of depression he tries to give me a name of anxiety he tries to give you a name of cancer he's trying to give that man the name of legion that wasn't his name that wasn't his name you are a son and a daughter of the almighty living god don't recognize that anymore that's not your cancer that's not your depression that is not your anxiety this is your freedom this is your god and he is here in the building this morning he is here so give him praise give him worship recognize he's here do not let your opportunity pass him by don't let him pass you by oh don't let him pass you by today church oh hallelujah oh hallelujah [Music] oh he promised a refreshing that's what wednesday night was bro joe a refreshing he promised a refreshing in the presence but you gotta recognize that presence when it comes satan fights that he don't want you to have a refreshing because when you're refreshed you're a better runner when you're refreshed you're a better fighter when you're refreshed you're a better soldier when you're refreshed you're more focused on your goal so he's trying to keep you from your refreshing keep you from recognizing look for most of you this isn't about saving you're christians most of you've received your salvation i believe you're christians but it's about being victorious it's about being overcomers it's about walking in the supernatural realizing his presence receiving every opportunity that he has given you and being all that you can be it's about being refreshed each and every day for the battle having your need met in the services being charged running into the battle with your sword drawn it's about fighting these final steps church were there there that's not time to put your sword back in the sheets we need a refreshing we need a refreshing we need to draw our sword and go to fight for our family fight for our loved ones fight for our hell fight for our friends if i ask for hands how many would say there's some out there i need to fight for there's people i need to fight for we need to see these pews full we need to see these altars full i need a refreshing myself so i can fight for them i must recognize your presence in this building today lord so i can fight the way you called me to fight it's about being victorious because we recognize that the captain of the lord's host the angel of the lord jesus christ is leading this charge he is present he is i am oh satan wants to keep you from your refreshing brother joe he wants to keep you from refreshing brother william listen he couldn't keep lazarus in the tomb he couldn't keep israel in bondage he couldn't let the sun go down when joshua wanted to stop it he couldn't keep jesus in the tomb he couldn't keep the holy ghost from falling he couldn't have daniel destroyed in the lines then so i don't care what he doesn't want you to get this morning if my god said you can have a refreshing in the presence of the lord that be refreshed in the presence of the lord he can't stop it he can't stop it when i look back at who he is and what he has done and what he has provided all he provided around for abraham he provided a road through the middle of the ocean he raised the dead he healed the blind satan just tried to stop this healing just try to stop this deliverance just try to stop this church just try to stop this rapture you ain't got hallelujah he can't stop your times of refreshing he ain't got enough sister jessica you come sing for us awake he's here [Music] awake he's gonna be with you in the morning be aware don't miss your opportunities hallelujah so many examples down through the scripture that i couldn't even get to didn't have the time i'm gonna let sister jessica sing about one of them [Music] recognize your opportunity in his [Music] presence day before yesterday they
