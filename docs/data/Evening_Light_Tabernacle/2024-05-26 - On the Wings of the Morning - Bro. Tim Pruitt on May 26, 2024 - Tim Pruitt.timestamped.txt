[1:00:29] shall I flee from thy
[1:00:32] presence if iend up to heaven Thou Art
[1:00:35] there if I make my bed in hell behold
[1:00:39] Thou Art there if I take the wings of
[1:00:42] the morning and dwell in the uttermost
[1:00:45] parts of the
[1:00:47] sea even there shall the hand lead me
[1:00:51] and thy right hand shall hold me if I
[1:00:54] say surely the darkness shall cover me
[1:00:57] even the night shall be light about me
[1:01:01] yay the darkness hideth not from thee
[1:01:05] but the night shineth as the day and the
[1:01:08] Darkness and the light are both alike to
[1:01:11] thee God bless you you can be seated
[1:01:15] amen God bless
[1:01:17] you I'd like to take another scripture
[1:01:19] reading from 1 Thessalonians chapter
[1:01:23] 4 as we look look into the word and I'm
[1:01:27] going to focus especially on the last
[1:01:30] verse that I'm going to read um this
[1:01:33] morning as we look into this 1
[1:01:36] Thessalonians 4:3 but I would not have
[1:01:39] you to be ignorant Brethren concerning
[1:01:41] them which are asleep that you saw not
[1:01:44] even as others which have no hope for if
[1:01:47] we believe that Jesus died and rose
[1:01:50] again even so them also which sleep in
[1:01:53] Jesus will God bring with him for this
[1:01:56] we say unto you by the word of the Lord
[1:01:59] that we which are alive and remain until
[1:02:01] the coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[1:02:04] them which are asleep for the Lord
[1:02:06] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:02:09] shout with the voice of the Archangel
[1:02:12] with the Trump of God and the dead in
[1:02:14] Christ shall rise first then when we
[1:02:18] which are alive and remain shall be
[1:02:21] caught up together with them in the
[1:02:22] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[1:02:25] so shall we ever be with the Lord
[1:02:28] wherefore Comfort one another with these
[1:02:34] words this morning I'm going to speak to
[1:02:37] you on a subject that as I was praying
[1:02:42] and contemplating for the services this
[1:02:45] today and um that just came to me as I
[1:02:50] as I was just in
[1:02:52] prayer and the scripture where he said
[1:02:55] says here if I take the wings of the
[1:02:59] morning and I'm going to speak to you
[1:03:02] this morning on that subject on the
[1:03:04] wings of the
[1:03:06] morning now we have read also from the
[1:03:11] words of Paul where he left a word of
[1:03:14] comfort and of course the psalmist David
[1:03:18] here is speaking of words that you know
[1:03:21] of of where can we go from your presence
[1:03:25] the wherever we are you are there
[1:03:28] because he has made us a promise I will
[1:03:31] never leave you or forsake you I'll be
[1:03:34] with you even to the end of the world
[1:03:36] this is a promise given to us as
[1:03:39] Believers and the psalmist speaks of the
[1:03:42] wings of the morning those first rays of
[1:03:45] light that come with the Dawn and it
[1:03:49] seems like sometimes for us who may be
[1:03:53] wrestled during the night that ESP
[1:03:55] especially maybe if you're dead asleep
[1:03:58] maybe you don't notice the night but for
[1:04:02] those that are sometimes are watching
[1:04:04] the clock and seeing the hours pass and
[1:04:08] and you're you know you're disturbed
[1:04:10] during the night it seems like that
[1:04:12] night will never end and for some of us
[1:04:15] we can't wait for the
[1:04:18] Dawn and we you know we yearn for it we
[1:04:21] sing of it and you know songs have been
[1:04:24] written by by when the morning comes
[1:04:28] when all the saints of God are gathered
[1:04:30] home we we sing of that bright and
[1:04:34] cloudless morning when the dead in
[1:04:36] Christ arise and the glory of his
[1:04:39] resurrection share and when his Chosen
[1:04:42] One Shall Gather to their home beyond
[1:04:44] the skies when the role is CAU up yonder
[1:04:47] I'll be
[1:04:48] there you see it is the hope of the
[1:04:53] ages and and that some golden Daybreak
[1:04:58] Jesus will come and and of course it is
[1:05:02] for for the world that we're living in
[1:05:05] as darkness is entering in and and
[1:05:08] things are getting progressively worse
[1:05:10] and worse upon upon the world that we
[1:05:13] live in that and and yet mankind looks
[1:05:18] and they're expecting even themselves a
[1:05:22] a new era that is Dawning and they are
[1:05:25] telling us that things will are
[1:05:27] happening that will change the world as
[1:05:29] we know it artificial intelligence is
[1:05:33] here and many of course fear that that
[1:05:36] it's going to destroy human life you
[1:05:38] know just recently United States uh
[1:05:41] completed the first dog fight between uh
[1:05:44] AI controlled F-16 and the human pilot
[1:05:48] our own um Air Force secretary Frank
[1:05:51] Kendall flew in a AI controlled F-16
[1:05:55] just a few weeks ago that matched up
[1:05:57] well against experienced human pilots in
[1:06:00] dog fights and he never touched a
[1:06:02] control and with artificial intelligence
[1:06:06] and automation driverless cars are on
[1:06:09] the road that have now driven over you
[1:06:12] know um 20 million miles and so you know
[1:06:17] we we we're living in a day where things
[1:06:20] are rapidly
[1:06:22] changing and and of course if it was
[1:06:25] progressing toward a better more gentler
[1:06:29] more Kinder world it would be maybe
[1:06:32] wonderful but that's not where is
[1:06:34] advancing to with it comes is more evil
[1:06:38] than ever but I I thought about you know
[1:06:41] the intelligence as they look for
[1:06:43] artificial intelligence I thought about
[1:06:46] how that 91 years ago God's intelligence
[1:06:49] through a prophetic eye by Vision saw a
[1:06:53] driver's car described
[1:06:56] as shaped like an egg so it's
[1:06:59] aerodynamic and and that's a new world
[1:07:02] word that has been invented I don't know
[1:07:05] Michael if you I sent you some pictures
[1:07:07] I don't know I forgot to tell you to
[1:07:09] have them ready for me but you know if
[1:07:11] you know they they have the the
[1:07:13] driverless cars that was going down the
[1:07:16] road and one was seen the other day in
[1:07:19] menen um you know we have the as I said
[1:07:22] the the weo car the autonomous car is
[1:07:25] now clocked over 20 million miles of of
[1:07:29] real driving real world Driving
[1:07:32] Experience through countless situation
[1:07:34] it's the equivalent of driving to the
[1:07:37] Moon and Back 40
[1:07:39] times and so you know we we have
[1:07:43] advancement in in science and we have
[1:07:47] God's intelligence telling us a long
[1:07:50] time ago that this was coming and that
[1:07:54] we have now ared that we are now at the
[1:07:57] time where uh prophecy is being
[1:08:00] fulfilled as brother brandom had the
[1:08:02] seven continuous visions and one of them
[1:08:05] was the progression of science would
[1:08:07] that there would be
[1:08:09] automation um like this and so we know
[1:08:13] that the bride of Christ is also going
[1:08:16] beyond the wisdom of man the the and by
[1:08:20] the way that was the Google card that I
[1:08:22] was showing you there um that that is
[1:08:25] also there not just the wayo but the the
[1:08:27] Google car and so you know they they
[1:08:30] have all kinds of designs and
[1:08:32] aerodynamic ways to to promote this and
[1:08:36] and many of them describes the vision
[1:08:38] that brother brandham uh had almost
[1:08:41] perfectly and so but yet you know we
[1:08:44] talk about the body of Christ we also
[1:08:48] have received a
[1:08:50] intelligence a great intelligence that
[1:08:53] comes as we see the night ending and a
[1:08:57] New Day Dawning and the approaching of
[1:09:00] of Christ and and so brother Bram told
[1:09:03] us this that he said see down to the age
[1:09:07] we started out from the foundation from
[1:09:09] the first church age when the seed went
[1:09:11] in the ground the complete seed and then
[1:09:13] come out through the feet Luther back
[1:09:16] then through Wesley then to Pentecost to
[1:09:18] tongues and in the lips and now it's in
[1:09:20] the eyes the prophetic of Malachi 4 and
[1:09:23] now there's nothing left for it but for
[1:09:27] him himself to step into that because
[1:09:31] that's the last thing the next is the
[1:09:33] intelligence and we have no intelligence
[1:09:36] of our own it's his we have no sight of
[1:09:38] our own how can a man foresee these
[1:09:40] things he can't do it it's God himself
[1:09:43] and it's com into a place and he's
[1:09:45] governed the body all the way through
[1:09:47] then the complete body of Christ is
[1:09:49] revealed in the form of a bride that was
[1:09:53] taken out of his side like Adam was at
[1:09:55] the beginning see you he says he goes on
[1:09:59] he says the next intelligence is Christ
[1:10:02] himself who controls the whole body so
[1:10:06] we come as he was talking about from the
[1:10:08] feet from Luther and and and through the
[1:10:10] body through Wesley and then the the
[1:10:14] lips and tongue through Pentecost and
[1:10:16] now the prophetic eye through Malachi 4
[1:10:19] and now here all is left is just for the
[1:10:23] intelligence of Christ to come down down
[1:10:25] into the body amen Christ is here in his
[1:10:29] intelligence and that's why that he
[1:10:32] could tell us with with astounding
[1:10:36] accurate
[1:10:37] discernment you know the the names the
[1:10:39] addresses the the the the conditions
[1:10:43] foretelling the future um telling of the
[1:10:46] past go 40 years back in somebody's life
[1:10:49] there were other gifted men and maybe
[1:10:52] they were 80% sometimes uh uh on other
[1:10:55] times off and but this intelligence was
[1:10:59] God using a man through a prophetic
[1:11:02] voice showing us that the complete word
[1:11:06] is here and and those that are familiar
[1:11:10] with um artificial intelligence tell us
[1:11:13] that the power grids that we have today
[1:11:16] will not supply the need for the energy
[1:11:19] required for the artificial intelligence
[1:11:22] that is going to take a a huge boost in
[1:11:25] our energy sector and and of course
[1:11:28] economics are recommending you know
[1:11:31] stocks in different um areas you know to
[1:11:34] to to get ready for this advancement in
[1:11:37] science but I want to say about our
[1:11:40] intelligence that we have received it
[1:11:42] comes with a an energy supply of the
[1:11:46] fullness of the Holy Ghost and it's
[1:11:49] Dynamic working power so it's not
[1:11:52] something separate that we need it is
[1:11:55] what we need for this hour and of course
[1:11:59] we we've seen that it was quickening
[1:12:01] power that came and opened up the Seven
[1:12:03] Seals and I'm quoting from it is the
[1:12:05] rising of the Sun and he said what was
[1:12:08] that the intelligence of of a man no it
[1:12:11] was the quickening power of God and and
[1:12:14] so it was God that came and made us know
[1:12:18] exactly what these truths was for this
[1:12:21] end time that we're living in and that
[1:12:24] is because because there is a there is a
[1:12:27] coming an end to the church ages as we
[1:12:30] know it there's coming an end to the
[1:12:32] darkness that is of this world Amen
[1:12:36] there is coming there of a of a great
[1:12:39] power that is rising this intelligence
[1:12:42] tells us that there is a woman rising
[1:12:46] and this woman is the Bride of Jesus
[1:12:48] Christ and she will rise in power and in
[1:12:52] demonstration and she's here now upon
[1:12:55] the Earth amen we are we are seeing it
[1:12:58] we are we are experiencing it but this
[1:13:01] also intelligence told us that a
[1:13:04] foretold of a woman rising through the
[1:13:07] popular vote of a woman of women who
[1:13:10] would either be vice president or
[1:13:12] president but a woman of great power
[1:13:16] perhaps he said the Catholic church he
[1:13:18] would hold America in her complete Sway
[1:13:21] and this Vision described her in Royal
[1:13:25] purple and and here she is in Royal
[1:13:29] Purple right at her own inauguration
[1:13:33] there and it was described in the
[1:13:35] magazines and everything especially made
[1:13:38] in Royal Purple for this occasion and
[1:13:41] brother brandham said this in in the
[1:13:43] 70th week of Daniel he said that brings
[1:13:46] us then to the election of President
[1:13:48] Kennedy and this car is coming on the
[1:13:51] scene brings five things out of the
[1:13:54] seven and now I predicted I saw a great
[1:13:57] woman stand up beautiful looking dressed
[1:14:00] in High royal highly Royals like purple
[1:14:05] and I got little parentheses down there
[1:14:07] she was a great ruler in the United
[1:14:09] States perhaps the Catholic Church a
[1:14:12] woman some woman I don't know her to be
[1:14:14] the Catholic church I don't know I can't
[1:14:15] say only thing I saw the woman that was
[1:14:18] all and I tell you in this election we
[1:14:20] got
[1:14:22] both the woman as vice president and the
[1:14:25] Catholic church we have in office the
[1:14:28] first Catholic President since Kennedy
[1:14:32] to hold
[1:14:33] office now I want you to remember what
[1:14:36] he told us this this woman and we're not
[1:14:39] just talking about this woman here but
[1:14:42] we're talking about the
[1:14:44] administration and what is behind it we
[1:14:47] I want you I want you to listen
[1:14:49] carefully to what he said would happen
[1:14:53] she will leave the nation to
[1:14:58] pollution I'm just
[1:15:01] quoting this Administration has had gay
[1:15:04] and transgender celebrations in the
[1:15:06] White House advancing their cause more
[1:15:09] than any other
[1:15:11] Administration they boast now that
[1:15:13] roughly 15% of all appointees identify
[1:15:17] themselves as lesbian gay bisexual trans
[1:15:20] transgender and queer they have the Pete
[1:15:24] Buddha is the first openly gay Senate
[1:15:27] confirmed cabinet secretary in the
[1:15:29] United States as our transportation
[1:15:33] secretary and and of course under this
[1:15:37] Administration the very things that
[1:15:39] Clinton said was wrong a liberal who
[1:15:43] said it would never be he signed into
[1:15:47] law same-sex
[1:15:50] marriages this is all the
[1:15:53] pollution and man as and and let me
[1:15:56] quote she will guide or lead this nation
[1:16:01] to
[1:16:04] ruination now we have a national debt
[1:16:07] that is over 35
[1:16:09] trillion now we that means that every
[1:16:12] living breathing American automatically
[1:16:15] if you have a baby just born that baby
[1:16:18] owes already over $100,000 in debt you
[1:16:22] have a family of five you have a half a
[1:16:24] million that you owe as an American
[1:16:29] citizen so she will lead or guide this
[1:16:32] nation to R Nation she held her people
[1:16:36] in her complete power and this
[1:16:40] Administration does what it
[1:16:43] wants if the Supreme Court says it
[1:16:46] cannot forgive student loans this
[1:16:48] Administration does it
[1:16:50] anyway you know what they circumvent
[1:16:53] laws and have flooded country with 7
[1:16:56] million illegals or more who are now
[1:16:59] they're given voting rights
[1:17:02] to is opened our borders to
[1:17:05] Palestinians inviting them to come into
[1:17:08] our
[1:17:09] country who not only hate Israel but
[1:17:12] hate
[1:17:14] America and we have the nation of Israel
[1:17:17] is under attack World courts and World
[1:17:21] opinion is against her and I want you to
[1:17:24] remember the battle that she is in and
[1:17:26] the battle you are in is more than a
[1:17:29] physical battle it is a spiritual
[1:17:32] battle and so she she is definitely the
[1:17:36] burdensome stone that is spoke of in
[1:17:39] zechariah's Prophecy Zechariah
[1:17:42] 12:3 and in that day I will make
[1:17:45] Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all
[1:17:49] people all that burden themselves with
[1:17:51] it shall be cut in pieces though all all
[1:17:55] the people of the earth be gathered
[1:17:57] together against it that's Zechariah
[1:17:59] 12:3 so you see here's a condition that
[1:18:02] we're in the whole world this is the
[1:18:06] burdensome Stone you know again they can
[1:18:09] be attacked there the women raped and
[1:18:12] and and young people murdered and
[1:18:15] everything else but it's always Israel's
[1:18:17] fault they are the aggressor they are
[1:18:20] the they are the one in the wrong
[1:18:21] they're the they're the one that you
[1:18:23] know and they can give them land and and
[1:18:25] as I said again there is no such thing
[1:18:28] as a Palestinian country there's a
[1:18:30] country of
[1:18:32] Israel Palestinians are
[1:18:35] Arabs amen and they and they don't even
[1:18:38] belong there but they give them rights
[1:18:40] and they give them voting rights and
[1:18:42] they give them they welcome them and to
[1:18:44] to live there but they will not live
[1:18:46] there
[1:18:47] peaceably and the world wants them Co
[1:18:50] totally destroyed from The River To The
[1:18:53] Sea because this is the same Spirit of
[1:18:56] the Antichrist that is against the bride
[1:18:59] of Christ and I'll tell you if it wasn't
[1:19:02] for
[1:19:04] Grace you would go through the
[1:19:07] tribulation but God promised a Rapture
[1:19:10] in this
[1:19:11] AG he promised an escape amen from the
[1:19:16] things that are coming upon the Earth
[1:19:17] and he told you to pray
[1:19:20] always Amen to to that you would escape
[1:19:23] the things that are coming upon the
[1:19:24] Earth and be a accounted worthy to stand
[1:19:26] before the son of
[1:19:30] man I'll tell you what if you'll let the
[1:19:32] son of man the word judge you now you
[1:19:35] will not have to be
[1:19:38] judged otherwise you'll go through the
[1:19:41] tribulation for
[1:19:44] purging there's a wise and there's a
[1:19:47] foolish virgin I say it's foolish to
[1:19:50] turn down the opportunities that we
[1:19:52] have and miss the great Rapture of the
[1:19:57] church now man of course has got into
[1:20:01] God's laboratory and here's the plague I
[1:20:04] want you to read it from Zechariah
[1:20:07] 14:12 Zechariah 14:12 says and this
[1:20:10] shall be the plague wherewith the Lord
[1:20:13] will Smite all the people that have
[1:20:17] fought against Jerusalem their flesh
[1:20:20] shall consume away while they stand up
[1:20:22] on their feet and their tongues or their
[1:20:24] eyes shall consume away in their holes
[1:20:27] and their tongue shall consume away in
[1:20:29] their
[1:20:30] mouth we could actually turn to
[1:20:32] Revelation 13 and we could show where
[1:20:35] the Beast or the image of the Beast has
[1:20:38] great power to bring fire down from
[1:20:41] heaven you see we are here we are here
[1:20:44] and this intelligence it's not an
[1:20:47] artificial intelligence it's a prophetic
[1:20:50] voice that has spoke to us in this day
[1:20:52] and this intelligence has already shown
[1:20:56] uh smoke and bombs and craters all over
[1:20:59] the land of
[1:21:01] America as far as I'm concerned you can
[1:21:04] get ready to
[1:21:08] leave amen cuz there is no other
[1:21:11] hope there is no other refuge and there
[1:21:15] is no other
[1:21:16] strength that the this intelligence
[1:21:20] admonished us to watch Russia watch
[1:21:23] Russia keep your eyes on the King of the
[1:21:26] North Daniel's Vision shows us um that
[1:21:30] the iron and the clay will not mix you
[1:21:33] know that we have we have today Russia
[1:21:36] and China and Iran and Arabs that are
[1:21:39] joining together in a coalition and
[1:21:41] America and her allies joining together
[1:21:44] and the Bible said they will not
[1:21:46] mix it is in this stage after the
[1:21:49] Gentile kingdoms coming down from
[1:21:51] Babylon if you remember what I'm
[1:21:54] referring to is that there was a a a an
[1:21:59] image that Nebuchadnezzar saw and he saw
[1:22:03] it with a head of gold and then it had
[1:22:07] the arms and and chest of of of brass or
[1:22:11] or silver rather and then come down to
[1:22:13] to brass and in the in the loins and
[1:22:16] came on down into the feet and legs as
[1:22:20] iron and then when it gets to the end of
[1:22:22] the kingdoms it is iron and
[1:22:25] Clay so it is it is the mix so you see
[1:22:30] it came down from as Daniel uh
[1:22:34] interpreted he said you're the head of
[1:22:36] gold the Babylonian Kingdom there's
[1:22:39] coming another which is going to be the
[1:22:41] mes and the Persian after that he
[1:22:44] prophesies this is this is not
[1:22:46] artificial intelligence this is God's
[1:22:50] intelligence and it's given to a
[1:22:52] prophetic voice and the proph IC voice
[1:22:55] said it'll go from the mes and the
[1:22:56] Persian to the Grecian Empire and from
[1:22:59] that to the
[1:23:01] Romans and then come right on down into
[1:23:04] the iron and the
[1:23:05] clay and we're
[1:23:07] here we have
[1:23:10] arrived so the kingdoms are divided of
[1:23:13] this world and they're against each
[1:23:16] other and they will not
[1:23:18] mix but Daniel saw in the vision he saw
[1:23:22] more than that he saw a stone without
[1:23:26] hands come there and smite the feet of
[1:23:30] that image and it crumbled together and
[1:23:33] fall down and built then was a great
[1:23:36] mountain of the Lord from where God
[1:23:39] Reigns upon the Earth there is a
[1:23:41] millennium
[1:23:44] coming the kingdoms of this world will
[1:23:48] be the kingdoms of our Lord and his
[1:23:50] Christ this is the promise that is given
[1:23:53] and this is the intelligence we have
[1:24:00] received y the book holds many wonderful
[1:24:04] truths and
[1:24:05] Revelations and
[1:24:07] Promises of the time of Darkness that
[1:24:10] one day it'll soon be
[1:24:13] over but sometimes we ask when will
[1:24:16] morning
[1:24:19] come right now it's still dark it's so
[1:24:22] very dark even the Book of Revelation
[1:24:24] shows the Gentile ages are
[1:24:28] nighttime did you ever notice there are
[1:24:32] symbolic scenes there of seven
[1:24:36] stars in the hand of Jehovah there are
[1:24:40] are in the hand of Jesus who is the
[1:24:42] Jehovah of the Old Testament and there
[1:24:45] are
[1:24:46] lampstands seven golden lampstands these
[1:24:50] are not used in the daytime these are
[1:24:52] used at night and this night because
[1:24:54] Christ has left the
[1:24:56] Earth and so you
[1:24:59] see again it seems sometimes that
[1:25:03] morning will never come you see the
[1:25:06] seventh Church age was supposed to be
[1:25:09] the shortest age is now exceeded the
[1:25:12] first church age by a
[1:25:14] year if I could say it this way the
[1:25:17] messenger left when he was but 56 years
[1:25:21] of age and has now been gone 58 years
[1:25:25] two years longer than what he was even
[1:25:28] alive you see again we ask the question
[1:25:32] when will morning
[1:25:35] come because we see the world is getting
[1:25:38] darker and
[1:25:40] darker and and Peter told us of a
[1:25:43] habener to his coming and it would be
[1:25:46] that there would be a time of delay that
[1:25:49] would make a way for scoffers to come
[1:25:52] and they would Express doubt and in that
[1:25:55] time people would lose faith and
[1:25:57] remember this is this is what Jesus said
[1:26:00] when I come will I find
[1:26:03] Faith he didn't ask if he would find
[1:26:06] churches or Assemblies of people or
[1:26:09] people who sang and worship he wanted to
[1:26:11] find Faith somebody that believed
[1:26:14] him and we look here at this so the ABG
[1:26:18] to his coming one of the signs will be
[1:26:22] as it spoke of in 2 Peter 3
[1:26:24] and verse three know knowing this first
[1:26:29] that there shall come in the last days
[1:26:31] scuffers walking after their own lust
[1:26:35] saying where is the promise of his
[1:26:38] coming for since the fathers fell asleep
[1:26:41] all things continue as they were from
[1:26:44] the beginning of the
[1:26:46] creation so you see because that you
[1:26:49] know Jesus wasn't coming back as they
[1:26:53] thought it was even even they were
[1:26:55] beginning to ask him questions and and
[1:26:58] even Paul said now concerning the things
[1:27:01] you have written me about you know
[1:27:04] concerning the those that are dead in
[1:27:06] Christ and he reassures whoever dies God
[1:27:10] will bring with them that they're not
[1:27:12] left out but we which are alive and
[1:27:15] remain and he speaks of them that will
[1:27:18] be changed in a moment in the twinkling
[1:27:20] of an eye Paul tells us many many things
[1:27:24] about the coming of the Lord he tells us
[1:27:26] more about heaven than any of the other
[1:27:29] Apostles he would visit the you know
[1:27:32] into the Third Realm Of Heaven and he
[1:27:34] said I I I saw things that are are are
[1:27:38] are just too holy to be uttered and and
[1:27:41] yet he would let out little secrets you
[1:27:45] know we will not all sleep but we will
[1:27:47] all be changed and and he would tell us
[1:27:49] you know about how our what our mortal
[1:27:52] body would be like and different he had
[1:27:54] visited that
[1:27:56] realm and he was able to come back and
[1:27:58] tell us by an
[1:28:01] intelligence that was beyond Plato and
[1:28:05] Beyond the you know the the great man of
[1:28:08] the time and be able to tell them things
[1:28:11] that they didn't know at all because he
[1:28:14] had visited that realm and came back and
[1:28:18] said you know you know this this is the
[1:28:21] way that heaven is going to be you know
[1:28:23] the this house that you have you it's
[1:28:26] going to be changed and you're going to
[1:28:28] be clothed upon with a new body and he
[1:28:30] goes and describes every all kinds of
[1:28:33] things that are in that Heavenly
[1:28:36] Place John would be able to see it also
[1:28:39] and tell us of things that he saw in
[1:28:42] that realm all by a Divine
[1:28:46] intelligence
[1:28:48] but you know because of of the delay it
[1:28:53] gives a occasions to scuffers and and
[1:28:56] and I'll just tell you it's even hard on
[1:28:58] us as
[1:29:02] Believers and I I thought about it you
[1:29:05] know that you know as I was writing to
[1:29:07] church you know sometimes as we we look
[1:29:11] and we hear of things that God says and
[1:29:14] and and he speaks to us just recently I
[1:29:17] had a dream and I had a I had a dream
[1:29:20] and in this dream I I I I went into into
[1:29:24] heaven and as I went in there I a man I
[1:29:29] call him a man an angel came with the
[1:29:32] records and he opened up the records and
[1:29:35] he looked and he said and he saw me and
[1:29:39] he looked back at me and saw my
[1:29:41] something written in the book and he
[1:29:43] said it is not your time to come here
[1:29:47] you must go
[1:29:48] back but you must rest
[1:29:52] more and I thought about that what in
[1:29:54] the world does that mean I must
[1:29:58] rest so you know I took off to the cabin
[1:30:01] for a couple of days three or four days
[1:30:04] and I just
[1:30:05] rested I said well I was told to rest so
[1:30:09] I'll just go and I'll just rest for a
[1:30:11] couple of days and I sat there and watch
[1:30:14] the waves come in and the breeze blow
[1:30:16] and things like that and you know just
[1:30:19] contemplating on what I was told to do
[1:30:21] and and then as I was coming to church
[1:30:23] this morning morning I begin to realize
[1:30:25] it's not physical
[1:30:27] rest but it's resting on the
[1:30:31] promise it's looking there at what God
[1:30:34] Said and resting on it and knowing he'll
[1:30:38] never
[1:30:39] fail heavens and earth may pass away but
[1:30:42] his word never fails never never never
[1:30:46] will it
[1:30:48] fail and if there's anything we must do
[1:30:51] in this hour is enter into rest whatever
[1:30:55] don't get anxious don't get worried
[1:30:58] don't become fearful and Afraid rest
[1:31:01] God's got
[1:31:08] this if you can only realize that in
[1:31:11] your situation whether you're battling
[1:31:13] cancer whether youve had a bad past
[1:31:16] whether where you've been abused or
[1:31:18] mistreated if you just stop this for a
[1:31:20] moment and begin to rest in the promise
[1:31:24] and say yes God knew all about this and
[1:31:28] this is a path that he has used to bring
[1:31:31] me to God but oh Lord let me rest in
[1:31:35] your promise let me not strive against
[1:31:39] your will and where you happy in my life
[1:31:42] but let me
[1:31:52] rest but as a
[1:31:54] said
[1:31:56] sometimes as we waiting for morning to
[1:32:01] come
[1:32:03] we it gives occasion to
[1:32:06] scoffers and it's actually hard on
[1:32:10] Believers I I visited with Brother Gary
[1:32:13] and Sister Barbara
[1:32:15] stanky down in Manny this
[1:32:19] week they've been coming up to church
[1:32:21] here since 1998
[1:32:24] been faithful to the
[1:32:26] Lord he was a young man of 24 years of
[1:32:29] age when he embraced the message and he
[1:32:32] was baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:32:34] Jesus Christ Sister Barbara was
[1:32:38] 22 she'd been witnessed to by her mother
[1:32:41] her mother was Sister gladus
[1:32:45] McGary and although she and brother Gary
[1:32:48] had been in brother Brandon's meetings
[1:32:49] and witnessed and and as they sat there
[1:32:52] talking Brother Gary tried to T tried to
[1:32:55] describe the awesome and Indescribable
[1:32:59] presence of the angel of God as it went
[1:33:02] out over the audience and called out
[1:33:04] people by name and their addresses and
[1:33:07] their situations and told them and and
[1:33:10] he said I I I can't even put into
[1:33:13] words of that
[1:33:16] presence and you know
[1:33:19] um sister Barbara's mother you know came
[1:33:22] to to know the message witness to to
[1:33:26] them and and Sister Barbara became came
[1:33:29] to realize there was a message of
[1:33:31] restoration and she didn't know if her
[1:33:34] husband Brother Gary would receive it or
[1:33:36] not Brother Gary was very involved in
[1:33:39] his uncle's Assembly of God
[1:33:42] Church and you may not know it but he
[1:33:45] was born in Canada and if I understood
[1:33:47] right they immigrated into America and
[1:33:50] came to Missouri there and worked at a a
[1:33:54] certain School his mother and dad had to
[1:33:56] have employment to be able to come in to
[1:33:58] the
[1:33:59] country and you know he was he was there
[1:34:04] as a young boy in the in the meetings in
[1:34:07] in um brother Brandon's meetings and
[1:34:09] there a young boy he had had a pencil or
[1:34:11] something HD his eye there and blinded
[1:34:13] it and and he had trouble with that eye
[1:34:18] and and there his mother had a huge
[1:34:21] Gorder a huge Gorder that was there that
[1:34:24] was very noticeable and huge there on
[1:34:27] her on her throat and and um you know in
[1:34:32] the in the meeting there as the spirit
[1:34:34] of God moved she was called out and was
[1:34:37] told you know that she had this Gorder
[1:34:40] and she you know to believe and and
[1:34:43] receive and and and there the Gorder
[1:34:45] just
[1:34:46] disappeared and brother Gary was prayed
[1:34:49] for in that meeting there and and there
[1:34:51] was at least a partial restoration to
[1:34:54] his eye were things were were much much
[1:34:57] better but
[1:34:59] nevertheless as he being a young man now
[1:35:03] in in this Assembly of God Church he had
[1:35:07] positions and places head of head of
[1:35:10] different organizations there that they
[1:35:13] that they relied upon him was a song
[1:35:15] leader and he was there singing the song
[1:35:17] leading a song one morning I'll Fly Away
[1:35:21] some glad morning when this life is over
[1:35:23] I'll F away and he got to that part like
[1:35:26] a bird from prison bars have flown and
[1:35:30] as he did he heard the voice of God
[1:35:32] speak to him and said it's time to
[1:35:36] leave and he left family friends
[1:35:40] everything and embraced the message of
[1:35:43] the hour and was baptized in the name of
[1:35:46] the Lord Jesus Christ and for 60
[1:35:50] faithful years since he's heard the
[1:35:52] message he has looked for the coming of
[1:35:55] the Lord now he's 84 years of age I mean
[1:35:59] he's still I would like to say looking
[1:36:01] at the wings of the morning looking at
[1:36:04] the signs of the approaching sun and I
[1:36:08] you know you can feel it in our hearts
[1:36:11] and it's saying hurry up
[1:36:14] son amen hurry up you know my my time is
[1:36:18] here upon the Earth is about up and I'm
[1:36:21] hearing the sounds of the and the
[1:36:24] spirits of darkness and we're asking why
[1:36:28] is all the
[1:36:29] delay how come we continue to
[1:36:33] wait what Peter explained the delay he
[1:36:36] said first people are are willingly
[1:36:40] ignorant that God made the world and it
[1:36:43] belongs to
[1:36:45] God in other words that this is God's
[1:36:48] world and Satan will not rule here
[1:36:51] forever
[1:36:54] and so in Psalms 24 And1 said the Earth
[1:36:57] is the Lord's and the fullness thereof
[1:37:00] the world and they that dwell there in
[1:37:02] for he has founded upon the sea and
[1:37:04] established it upon the floods but right
[1:37:07] now Satan rules upon it but it belongs
[1:37:11] to God he's just a squatter Satanist and
[1:37:15] God will redeem it and he will live upon
[1:37:18] it with his people and I'll just tell
[1:37:20] you by Divine intelligence from the
[1:37:23] Bible the word of God Satan's Reign
[1:37:26] cannot continue
[1:37:31] forever in second Peter 3 and 3 I I I
[1:37:35] just I'm going to read a translation but
[1:37:37] you can read along but most importantly
[1:37:40] he said I want to remind you that in the
[1:37:42] last days scoffers will come mocking the
[1:37:45] truth and following their own
[1:37:48] desires second Peter 3 and verse4 and
[1:37:52] they will say what happened to the
[1:37:54] promise that Jesus is coming again for
[1:37:57] before the times of our ancestors
[1:37:59] everything has remained the same since
[1:38:02] the world was first created and then he
[1:38:05] said they deliberately forget that God
[1:38:08] made the heavens Long Ago by the word of
[1:38:11] his command and he brought the Earth out
[1:38:13] of the water out from the water and
[1:38:15] surrounded it with water and then he
[1:38:17] used the water to destroy the ancient
[1:38:20] world with a mighty flood and then by
[1:38:23] the same word the present heavens and
[1:38:26] the Earth has been sored up for fire and
[1:38:29] they are being kept for the day of
[1:38:31] judgment when ungodly people will be
[1:38:34] destroyed but you must not forget this
[1:38:37] one thing dear friends a day is like a
[1:38:40] thousand years to the Lord and a
[1:38:43] thousand years like a day the Lord isn't
[1:38:46] really slow about his promise as some
[1:38:49] people think no he is patient for your
[1:38:52] sake
[1:38:54] he does not want anyone to be destroyed
[1:38:57] but he wants everyone to
[1:38:59] repent but the day of the Lord will come
[1:39:03] as unexpectedly as a thief then to
[1:39:06] heavens and and we'll pass away with a
[1:39:09] terrible noise and their very elements
[1:39:11] themselves would dis disappear in Fire
[1:39:14] and the Earth and everything on it will
[1:39:16] be found to deserve
[1:39:19] judgment now as we're thinking of this
[1:39:23] what an age that we're living in what
[1:39:25] other age could the world be burned over
[1:39:28] by
[1:39:30] fire what other age could we be
[1:39:32] destroyed many times over with the
[1:39:36] arsenals that are that countries like
[1:39:39] America and Russia and others
[1:39:41] have many times
[1:39:44] over never has there ever been a time
[1:39:47] that we are we're so close to the
[1:39:51] burning now we we know that God red you
[1:39:55] know this Earth is the Lords and and it
[1:39:57] is a Fallen Earth when it when man fell
[1:40:00] the Earth fell with him and so sin began
[1:40:04] to rain and and of course Peace was gone
[1:40:08] before then it was like a millennium the
[1:40:11] the lion ate straw like the Bullock and
[1:40:13] and the Bible tells you that the lion
[1:40:16] would laid down by the like a lamb or
[1:40:19] with the lamb as as it will in the
[1:40:21] millennial Reign why why why does he
[1:40:23] speak of that because that's the way it
[1:40:26] was before the
[1:40:27] fall were that these words were so true
[1:40:31] nothing shall hurt or destroy in all of
[1:40:34] my Holy
[1:40:35] Mountain these are the intelligence of
[1:40:38] God this is the way the world was
[1:40:41] sometimes people look at their
[1:40:42] situations and they wonder why did God
[1:40:45] do this to me why did God let this
[1:40:48] happen if he's God how come this
[1:40:51] happened in my life what why am I
[1:40:54] suffering the way I did why did people
[1:40:56] abuse me why did bad things happen to me
[1:40:59] well I'll just tell you this is not the
[1:41:05] Millennium this is a time where sins
[1:41:08] rain and it wasn't originally that way
[1:41:12] when God made the Earth it was all
[1:41:14] perfect there was no sin when God was
[1:41:17] King over the Earth man there was no
[1:41:21] there was no filth there was no adulter
[1:41:23] there was no sin there was no no
[1:41:27] murders there was nothing
[1:41:29] hurt but when man chose between
[1:41:33] knowledge the knowledge the intelligence
[1:41:36] the knowledge between good and evil that
[1:41:40] everything that we have that is good
[1:41:42] evil comes with
[1:41:44] it it's a world with with a mixture and
[1:41:48] so therefore awful things happen because
[1:41:52] Satan is right now The Prince and the
[1:41:54] power of the air and he rules people and
[1:41:57] he gets into people and people hurt
[1:42:00] other people ruin other people's
[1:42:03] lives why couldn't God just stop it he
[1:42:08] will but because man chose this he has
[1:42:13] allowed men to live in temporary
[1:42:16] bodies but he puts an expiration date on
[1:42:19] everybody that is born in the world that
[1:42:22] you canot live here
[1:42:25] forever one day you're going to make an
[1:42:28] exit from this world just as you made an
[1:42:31] entrance into this
[1:42:33] world and this is only the preparation
[1:42:36] grounds and it's your opportunity and
[1:42:39] it's your time to
[1:42:44] choose because now you're on the same
[1:42:46] basis that Adam and Eve was choose life
[1:42:50] or
[1:42:52] knowledge choose Satan and Hell or
[1:42:55] choose God and
[1:42:58] Heaven and just let me make you
[1:43:00] something clear we sang the song this
[1:43:03] morning this world is not my home and
[1:43:06] that's true of this Cosmos but this
[1:43:08] Earth is our
[1:43:11] home whoever goes to heaven is only
[1:43:13] going there for a temporary time they
[1:43:16] will come back to live here upon this
[1:43:19] earth the earth is something that
[1:43:21] belongs to God and he redeems it he
[1:43:24] redeems it as he did in the days of Noah
[1:43:27] he flooded the world with water washed
[1:43:30] it clean he baptized
[1:43:33] it and then 2,000 years later or so here
[1:43:38] he here comes Jesus and he sheds his
[1:43:41] blood upon it
[1:43:43] right and then the last part of it to
[1:43:46] make a new Earth or to make a new
[1:43:48] heavens and new earth it will come out
[1:43:50] of being born out of fire
[1:43:53] so there will be the water the blood and
[1:43:55] the fire I mean it's exactly the steps
[1:43:58] of the birth water blood and
[1:44:01] spirit and God does the same thing with
[1:44:04] you and your new birth you you come
[1:44:06] through the water through repentance and
[1:44:08] through the blood by sanctification and
[1:44:11] then you come to receive the very Spirit
[1:44:13] of the Living God where he comes to live
[1:44:16] on you because by the way what God is
[1:44:19] doing when he redeems your soul he is
[1:44:22] also and your body for the
[1:44:28] resurrection but when Jesus went
[1:44:30] away two angels came and spoke with
[1:44:35] him and with some perhaps some of the
[1:44:39] 500 who saw him after his res
[1:44:42] Resurrection as the Bible said in 1
[1:44:44] Corinthians 15 and6 that he was seen of
[1:44:48] above 500 Brethren at
[1:44:50] once and yet the Bible tells tells you
[1:44:54] that as he was leaving giving his last
[1:44:58] instructions while they beheld him he
[1:45:00] was taken up and a cloud received him
[1:45:02] out of his
[1:45:04] sight out of their
[1:45:06] sight and the Bible tells you in Acts
[1:45:09] 1:1 that two men stood by them in white
[1:45:12] apparel which said ye men of Galilee why
[1:45:15] stand you gazing up into the heaven this
[1:45:19] same Jesus which was taken up from you
[1:45:23] you into heaven shall come so come in
[1:45:26] like manner as you've seen him go into
[1:45:31] heaven I think if I was standing present
[1:45:35] there and haven't heard the angels
[1:45:38] speak I I would believe that I would see
[1:45:42] that in my
[1:45:47] lifetime but instead of coming back
[1:45:50] immediately as promised the Bible tell
[1:45:53] told you in Mark 16 for example and Mark
[1:45:56] 16 tells you that instead of coming
[1:45:58] immediately back his promise he sat down
[1:46:01] on the right hand of the Majesty on high
[1:46:04] and there became the intercessor between
[1:46:08] God and sinful
[1:46:10] man so this is why that Peter would say
[1:46:14] wherefore beloved seeing that you look
[1:46:16] for such thing be diligent that you f be
[1:46:19] found in peace without spot and
[1:46:21] blameless and account that the
[1:46:23] longsuffering of God is
[1:46:27] salvation and I want you to think of
[1:46:29] just that just for a moment because even
[1:46:33] when the word was given to to Noah it's
[1:46:37] going to rain build an ark make
[1:46:40] preparation it would be 120 years
[1:46:44] later amen and yet while the Bible said
[1:46:48] it was the longsuffering of God waited
[1:46:51] in the days of Noah while the ark was a
[1:46:55] preparing so God making
[1:46:58] preparation allowed a time of
[1:47:02] longsuffering and I I want you to think
[1:47:05] about it be as we look at it this
[1:47:08] morning why did he come back
[1:47:11] then because had he came back we have
[1:47:16] would not be
[1:47:20] here his longsuffering
[1:47:23] has allowed many whose names were on the
[1:47:26] Lamb's Book of Life to be manifested on
[1:47:29] the
[1:47:30] earth and this is why that I I bring the
[1:47:33] scripture in in Hebrews 10 and 35
[1:47:36] Hebrews 10:35 cast not away therefore
[1:47:40] your confidence which has great
[1:47:43] recompense of reward whatever you do
[1:47:46] don't lose
[1:47:47] confidence in the promise don't cast it
[1:47:50] away it has great recomend Pense of
[1:47:54] reward I'm going to tell you even
[1:47:57] without a heaven even if there is no
[1:48:00] Rapture if our life to sins as death and
[1:48:02] nothingness the way of a Christian Life
[1:48:06] Is A Better
[1:48:11] Way the way of God uniting a man and a
[1:48:15] woman together under the under the
[1:48:18] dictates of marriage and binding them
[1:48:21] together and raising children raising up
[1:48:23] home and raising things right is a
[1:48:26] better
[1:48:28] way the the the the the words of the
[1:48:32] Bible of of of The Commandments of God
[1:48:34] of thou shall not steal or bear false
[1:48:37] with all of those are a better
[1:48:41] way but here he said cast not away your
[1:48:44] confidence that has a great recompense
[1:48:47] of reward I I'm just telling you the
[1:48:50] Christian life has a has great Rec Pense
[1:48:53] of reward even if without
[1:48:56] heaven but Heaven of course will be a
[1:48:59] greater
[1:49:01] reward and we look forward that but he
[1:49:03] said you have need of patience that
[1:49:06] after you have done the will of God you
[1:49:08] might receive the
[1:49:10] promise so what should you seek in your
[1:49:14] life today God let me find your
[1:49:17] will you've got a purpose and you've got
[1:49:20] a plan and I'm not here by accident but
[1:49:23] your longsuffering has allowed me to be
[1:49:26] here because my name was in the Lamb's
[1:49:28] Book of Life now let me find your will
[1:49:31] for my life and walk in
[1:49:36] that for yet a little while he said and
[1:49:39] he that shall come will come and will
[1:49:41] not
[1:49:42] t now the just shall live by faith but
[1:49:46] if any man draw back my soul shall have
[1:49:49] no pleasure in him so he warns you don't
[1:49:52] put your hand on the plow and look
[1:49:55] back my soul has no pleasure in
[1:49:58] them that draw
[1:50:01] back but the just shall live by
[1:50:05] faith
[1:50:07] faith God I don't understand but I'm
[1:50:10] taking another step that's
[1:50:12] right I don't understand life situations
[1:50:15] but I'm making I'm going forward not
[1:50:19] backwards many times we're standing at a
[1:50:21] Red Sea moment and here we are
[1:50:24] surrounded in every way but it's a
[1:50:26] moment that you just go
[1:50:29] forward knowing that God's going to open
[1:50:31] the
[1:50:32] way knowing that he made a promise and
[1:50:36] he told us not to draw back so we'll not
[1:50:38] go back into Egypt we'll not go back in
[1:50:40] the world but we'll go forward even if
[1:50:43] we don't understand how it will open
[1:50:46] when we don't understand exactly how or
[1:50:48] where to put our foot but we just make
[1:50:51] up a a step forward because we got to go
[1:50:54] through I'm going through Jesus yes I'm
[1:50:57] going
[1:50:59] [Applause]
[1:51:03] through verse 12 of Peter 3 that we have
[1:51:06] been
[1:51:07] reading I want to just read
[1:51:10] this because he says as you wait for the
[1:51:13] day of God do your best or do your part
[1:51:18] to make it come soon
[1:51:24] the day when the heavens will burn up
[1:51:26] and be destroyed and the heavenly bodies
[1:51:28] will be melted by the
[1:51:30] heat but as you wait for the day of
[1:51:34] God do your best to make it come
[1:51:41] soon
[1:51:44] now I know we have many anxious
[1:51:48] hearts and the delay is so frustrating
[1:51:51] and upsetting
[1:51:53] but there's always been a
[1:51:55] delay
[1:51:57] always and we get impatient for the
[1:52:00] night to be
[1:52:01] over it seem like the longer we wait and
[1:52:04] the further we go along the more
[1:52:07] difficult is the
[1:52:10] delay however we are living in the
[1:52:13] Fulfillment of the word of
[1:52:16] God let to take off my coat
[1:52:24] I want to just press some things to your
[1:52:26] heart this morning if I
[1:52:28] can cuz we're living in the Fulfillment
[1:52:31] of the word of
[1:52:32] God after a long delay of 2,000 years
[1:52:36] for it is in this age that many
[1:52:40] scriptures and all tipes and
[1:52:44] shadows are
[1:52:47] fulfilled now you you don't realize it
[1:52:51] but things can walk along a long time
[1:52:55] and seem like nothing has happening and
[1:52:57] all of a
[1:52:59] sudden things
[1:53:03] change you know as it was in the days of
[1:53:06] Noah the Bible said you know as Peter
[1:53:09] spoke said while the ark Was preparing
[1:53:11] while things were getting made ready for
[1:53:14] that great climatic change that was
[1:53:16] going to happen and I can imagine every
[1:53:20] day just seemed like a another
[1:53:24] day there was no rain there was no
[1:53:26] clouds there were no Thunders there were
[1:53:28] no
[1:53:29] warnings other than a prophet's
[1:53:32] Voice who gave a Divine
[1:53:36] intelligence and warned there's a deluge
[1:53:39] coming something they had never seen and
[1:53:42] the day the Deluge began it was probably
[1:53:46] the sun started out shining probably
[1:53:49] like any other day
[1:53:53] sometimes I wonder even in some ways if
[1:53:56] the Rapture won't be that way just seem
[1:53:58] like another day as
[1:54:03] usual sometimes you think well this is
[1:54:05] going to happen I can be prayed up and
[1:54:07] this can has going to happen and I can
[1:54:09] be ready and you know maybe in 30 or 40
[1:54:11] days I can I can get things in order in
[1:54:13] my life and and whatever and it'll be
[1:54:18] like another
[1:54:20] day the Bible say de like a
[1:54:25] thief
[1:54:31] unexpectedly so the Bible prophesies of
[1:54:34] the end time he speaks of the com of the
[1:54:36] Lord and the time of the process of
[1:54:39] fulfillment and and it looks like a
[1:54:43] delay that things are just continuing
[1:54:45] like they've always
[1:54:48] done and when it happens it's mocked
[1:54:51] amen
[1:54:53] just like in the days of Noah you know
[1:54:55] you you idiot you've been preaching this
[1:54:57] 120
[1:54:59] years you've been building on this
[1:55:02] you've been you've been saying this is
[1:55:03] going to happen nothing's happened
[1:55:06] yet we've given our life we've we've had
[1:55:09] work on the ark we we've gave labor we
[1:55:11] did this you know halfway Believers
[1:55:14] brother brandom said you know stood
[1:55:15] around the ark saying you know maybe the
[1:55:19] old Prophet might be right maybe there
[1:55:20] might be something to this m message so
[1:55:23] they just kind of halfway Believers just
[1:55:25] kind of stood around waiting watching I
[1:55:28] I'll get
[1:55:29] in I'll get
[1:55:32] in and they didn't realize the ark that
[1:55:35] was being made had no room for
[1:55:43] them the ark you're building has to have
[1:55:47] room and it's got to be a god-
[1:55:49] constructed Arc
[1:55:53] in Peter's Second Epistle he tells you
[1:55:57] of this apparent delay and well you know
[1:55:59] what would be the attitude of people in
[1:56:01] this time that since it appeared that
[1:56:04] the Lord wasn't coming back like he said
[1:56:07] that men who once walk with God would
[1:56:09] begin to walk in their own
[1:56:15] lust you might
[1:56:17] ask me this morning and wonder so well
[1:56:20] brother Tim can you tell tell us can you
[1:56:23] tell us what time it is or where are we
[1:56:25] in time and uh well this is 2024 no
[1:56:28] where are we in Bible prophecy where are
[1:56:30] we in scripture and I tell you that's
[1:56:33] why that I have been preaching of search
[1:56:35] the scripture because it testify of you
[1:56:39] and of this day and I just want to say
[1:56:42] God is always right on
[1:56:44] time and that there's nothing out of
[1:56:47] order even though like with the three
[1:56:50] Hebrew children he might wait until you
[1:56:52] thrown in the fire but he'll be
[1:56:55] there amen you may be like Daniel in the
[1:56:58] Lion's Den but he's right there on
[1:57:02] time but we have so much that God has
[1:57:05] done in this
[1:57:07] age and yet we still don't see total
[1:57:12] fulfillment and you can see how he's
[1:57:15] worked though up to end time events and
[1:57:18] searching the scriptures you can see the
[1:57:21] types of the Bible whether it be of
[1:57:23] women such as Ruth or Rahab or Esther or
[1:57:26] the Virgin Mary or men like Enoch or
[1:57:29] Abraham or Moses with the Exodus or
[1:57:31] Joshua with the plac into the Heritage
[1:57:34] every one of them are pointing to this
[1:57:36] hour every one of them is God's voice
[1:57:41] showing you in the
[1:57:43] scripture Divine
[1:57:45] intelligence of the end time and the end
[1:57:48] time
[1:57:49] process we can actually spend hour on it
[1:57:52] like I did
[1:57:53] Sunday on just on Samson I took two
[1:57:56] hours showing the types and didn't do it
[1:57:59] justice but but you know somewhere there
[1:58:03] there is that people that nazarites that
[1:58:07] are separated and chosen amen who the as
[1:58:10] a type shows that though the church is
[1:58:13] tray though it's been seduced by Harlot
[1:58:15] churches though it's had a power shaved
[1:58:18] off in its final moments will have
[1:58:21] regrown those Seven Locks and come back
[1:58:23] to Covenant with God as a restored
[1:58:26] people a restored bride with the
[1:58:28] mightiest victory over death Hell In The
[1:58:31] Grave it's
[1:58:32] prophesied right in the scripture that's
[1:58:35] Divine
[1:58:37] intelligence brother Bram said in the
[1:58:40] message what shall we do with Jesus this
[1:58:43] Jesus called Christ he said listen we
[1:58:45] say about Satan's big machine up there
[1:58:48] ready to move that's right to crush down
[1:58:51] but remember God's Little Flock that
[1:58:53] believes the word its mechanics is ready
[1:58:56] too it's ready for the Dynamics to set
[1:58:59] it a fire with the Holy Ghost fear not
[1:59:01] little flock it's your father's Good
[1:59:04] Will to give you the kingdom the Holy
[1:59:07] Ghost will strike a little church that's
[1:59:10] come out of the world women that wears
[1:59:12] long hair nazarit to prove their
[1:59:15] separated themselves from the
[1:59:19] world each one of those lives
[1:59:22] like samsons were prophesying in this
[1:59:25] day because it's not just an event in
[1:59:28] history it's not just a fictitional
[1:59:31] character but their lives were
[1:59:34] prophesying of our day as I've explained
[1:59:37] to you and this is why Jesus would say
[1:59:39] as Jonah was in the belly of the whale
[1:59:41] he looked right there and saw himself in
[1:59:44] Jonah not as Australian
[1:59:47] Prophet but as one who would go into the
[1:59:50] belly of the well and come out in 3 days
[1:59:54] that he saw the son of man would also go
[1:59:56] down in the heart of of the earth and
[1:59:58] rise again and he saw his resurrection
[2:00:03] prophesied right there in Jonah's
[2:00:07] life and I'll tell you what where we're
[2:00:11] living at this time friends there's
[2:00:13] really a lot of things that are
[2:00:15] happening there's been a rapid I'm
[2:00:17] talking about a rapid fulfillment of
[2:00:19] scriptures in this day as a Leo de se an
[2:00:22] age is the age of the quick short work
[2:00:24] there have been so many things that have
[2:00:27] happened and are
[2:00:30] happening and it's been after a delay of
[2:00:33] 2,000 years I'm talking about seven
[2:00:36] Gentile Church ages where we have seen
[2:00:39] the scriptures actually come
[2:00:42] alive there's been a rapid fulfillment
[2:00:45] of Prophecy and we could say about most
[2:00:48] of the scripture this day this scripture
[2:00:52] is
[2:00:53] fulfilled if we looked at a scripture
[2:00:55] that laid dormant for thousands of years
[2:00:59] where he said behold I'll send you
[2:01:01] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[2:01:04] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[2:01:06] we can stand here today and say this day
[2:01:09] this scripture is
[2:01:11] fulfilled I'm looking at men and women
[2:01:13] who can identify with Joel's prophecy
[2:01:17] I'll pour out my spirit in the last day
[2:01:20] amen upon my sons and upon my daughters
[2:01:22] and they shall prophesy amen I'm talking
[2:01:26] about you today and we can say in many
[2:01:30] respect many scriptures manful
[2:01:32] scriptures this day this scripture has
[2:01:36] been
[2:01:38] fulfilled what an hour we're living in
[2:01:41] is a climatic
[2:01:46] time you're living at in the end of the
[2:01:50] Bible yeah a prophetic eye went back and
[2:01:53] told us what happened in the verse of
[2:01:55] the
[2:01:56] Bible come
[2:01:59] on Amen and then Trace that serpent all
[2:02:02] the way down to the
[2:02:03] scripture and here Trail him all the way
[2:02:06] down to the end to the end age is that
[2:02:09] right amen a prophetic insight has given
[2:02:12] us this is God's intelligence to this
[2:02:15] last
[2:02:16] age are you with me amen now so you see
[2:02:21] but we we not in the front of the
[2:02:23] scripture we're at the end of the
[2:02:26] scripture we're actually and I'll bring
[2:02:28] it out in a moment maybe but we're right
[2:02:30] here in the scripture or the last prayer
[2:02:33] of the Bible even so come Lord
[2:02:37] Jesus because that prayer will be
[2:02:40] answered in this day for a group of
[2:02:42] people who are alive and remain at the
[2:02:45] coming of the
[2:02:47] Lord and you're living there and you are
[2:02:50] writing the last
[2:02:53] acts before the
[2:03:00] Rapture you are a continuation of the
[2:03:03] books of Act of the book of Acts not a
[2:03:06] new book of Acts we are not writing a
[2:03:09] new book of Acts as if it's another book
[2:03:10] of Acts another that you know something
[2:03:12] unlike with the first what was in the
[2:03:15] first church is in the last Church it is
[2:03:18] a continuation of the same Ministry of
[2:03:20] the Holy Spirit working the same way in
[2:03:23] the people in the last
[2:03:25] day amen so you are here at the end of
[2:03:27] the Bible writing the last
[2:03:32] a before the
[2:03:35] Rapture every
[2:03:38] promise that spoke of the Bible or or
[2:03:41] the bride rather is being fulfilled in
[2:03:43] this
[2:03:44] hour and it's in this hour that God has
[2:03:47] done and I don't like to put it in the
[2:03:49] past but is doing
[2:03:52] Mighty things as he winds up the events
[2:03:56] that has to do with the coming of the
[2:03:57] Lord
[2:03:58] Jesus and it parallels his first coming
[2:04:01] as as Jesus of Galilee where the
[2:04:05] scriptures were being fulfilled it was
[2:04:07] you know when Jesus came it had been a
[2:04:10] long delay of 500
[2:04:14] years that's just twice as long as
[2:04:16] America has been a nation but I want you
[2:04:18] to think if you'll look over here and
[2:04:20] open up your Bible turn over here to the
[2:04:23] Book of Malachi and and Matthew and look
[2:04:26] right here and you're holding right here
[2:04:28] from where he says I will come and smite
[2:04:31] the Earth with a curse period and start
[2:04:34] right here the book of the generation of
[2:04:36] Jesus
[2:04:37] Christ 500
[2:04:41] years not a
[2:04:46] prophet not a word from God
[2:04:52] a lot of things were
[2:04:54] happening but from Malachi to
[2:04:57] Jesus
[2:05:01] silence look like nothing was happening
[2:05:04] yet everything was getting in
[2:05:07] place kingdoms was coming and getting in
[2:05:10] place the great Beast that was rising up
[2:05:13] that old that old serpent coming up out
[2:05:17] of Rome that we could read in
[2:05:19] Revelations chapter 12 where that where
[2:05:22] he sees you know that a woman standing
[2:05:25] there uh there with the moon at her feet
[2:05:27] and at her head where were 12 stars and
[2:05:30] it's Israel there and and there the law
[2:05:33] the Moon is a is a symbol of of the law
[2:05:35] of of good things to come and here she
[2:05:38] is there and she's about to give
[2:05:41] birth and at that moment a red dragon's
[2:05:44] on the scene so Israel is about to give
[2:05:47] birth to Messiah to a
[2:05:50] Manchild who will be rejected and caught
[2:05:53] up into heaven it's shown in the vision
[2:05:57] it's shown in Divine intelligence is
[2:05:59] somebody with me amen and there in in in
[2:06:03] that time here things are being prepared
[2:06:07] being prepared for the Messiah to come
[2:06:10] but it looks like nothing's
[2:06:13] happening and so from Malachi to John
[2:06:17] the
[2:06:18] Baptist there's not another prophecy not
[2:06:20] another word and then all of a sudden
[2:06:22] suddenly suddenly suddenly things
[2:06:25] change I I want to get that word to you
[2:06:27] suddenly suddenly things can
[2:06:30] change the Bible talks about his coming
[2:06:32] and associated with it in the hour you
[2:06:34] think not suddenly when you're least
[2:06:40] expected and here you got a man standing
[2:06:43] up you know he's got a wife that is
[2:06:45] Barren and he's bar then they ain't had
[2:06:48] a child and they're up in age and it's
[2:06:51] you know all these prayers have went on
[2:06:53] for years and years and years my my wife
[2:06:58] give us a child Lord give us a child and
[2:07:00] there and there on the outside Israel is
[2:07:02] praying oh God the Roman pow is is is is
[2:07:06] so brutal send the Messiah Lord send the
[2:07:09] Messiah and they're praying for the
[2:07:11] Messiah they're praying for the coming
[2:07:13] of the of that Messiah God send
[2:07:17] him and an angel appears
[2:07:23] out of
[2:07:24] nowhere an angel walks
[2:07:28] in as he's offering the
[2:07:33] incense sent from the presence of God
[2:07:37] said
[2:07:38] Zachariah you're going to have a
[2:07:45] child I'm answering your
[2:07:48] prayers as you have offered up this
[2:07:50] incense
[2:07:53] that has been going up now for hundreds
[2:07:55] of times I am now going to pray answer
[2:07:58] the prayers that you pray and it's now
[2:07:59] the
[2:08:01] time yeah you're old look like hope is
[2:08:06] gone you've been impatient and now you
[2:08:09] think it's
[2:08:10] impossible but I'm going to do
[2:08:12] it and this child is going to be a
[2:08:15] Nazarite he's not going to drink wine
[2:08:17] he's not he's going to be separated he's
[2:08:19] going to be surrendered to me and he's
[2:08:21] going to prepare the way before the
[2:08:25] Messiah and then from there you know
[2:08:28] right after that here here we have uh
[2:08:30] just within six months of there here
[2:08:33] comes a the angel of God Gabriel appears
[2:08:36] to
[2:08:40] Mary sisters don't think God can't
[2:08:42] appear to you angels can the first
[2:08:45] occurrence in the Bible was to a woman
[2:08:47] of an angel coming with a woman by the
[2:08:49] name of Hagar who was not even in the
[2:08:51] Covenant and whose child was wouldn't
[2:08:53] even be in the Covenant but God cared
[2:08:55] about
[2:09:00] him and if God cares about that amen a
[2:09:04] woman who's not even in the Covenant an
[2:09:06] Egyptian who's not even in the abrahamic
[2:09:08] Covenant whatsoever and the angel God
[2:09:11] Appears he'll appear to
[2:09:14] you if I can say it to you this morning
[2:09:18] you the woman the church can have an
[2:09:21] Angelic visitation from the
[2:09:24] almighty amen he's he's still God and he
[2:09:28] still does
[2:09:32] that he would appear to Paul he would
[2:09:35] appear to Phillip he would appear to
[2:09:37] Mary he would appear to those at the
[2:09:39] tomb he would appear again and again and
[2:09:42] again in the New Testament and he still
[2:09:44] that new testament God live your life
[2:09:47] where the angel can appear he can appear
[2:09:50] in this service this morning and we
[2:09:52] ought to expect him we got too much
[2:09:55] prophecy not to expect
[2:09:59] him here he
[2:10:03] comes and this wonderful glorious
[2:10:06] visitation
[2:10:08] comes then a word from God at his at his
[2:10:12] dedication Jesus dedication and
[2:10:15] then for 30 years you hear
[2:10:18] nothing it all goes silent
[2:10:22] looks
[2:10:24] like what of it nothing's
[2:10:28] happening
[2:10:30] SCS what he's going to be a mighty
[2:10:35] Prophet what this is going to be the
[2:10:38] Messiah this is this is this is a child
[2:10:41] that is born and and and the son is
[2:10:44] given and his name should be called I
[2:10:45] don't see nothing wonderful about
[2:10:49] him and then all of a sudden
[2:10:52] we hear of a man preaching down on the I
[2:10:56] started to say Ohio
[2:10:58] River but preaching right down on the
[2:11:01] River
[2:11:02] Jordan and there as he's preaching there
[2:11:05] he said he says now you know I I'm I'm
[2:11:09] not him but I've sent been sent to
[2:11:11] prepare the way for me I I'm I'm going
[2:11:14] to make the past trit I'm going to pull
[2:11:17] down the the high heels of man's exalted
[2:11:20] thoughts and the ions and I'm going to
[2:11:22] lift up neglected truth and I'm going to
[2:11:24] make the way prepared for the Messiah to
[2:11:29] come he's going to be here he's G he's
[2:11:33] going to be here he's he's going to be
[2:11:34] on the scene we're looking for him at
[2:11:36] any moment amen the spirit of God spoke
[2:11:39] to me and said that that the one I saw
[2:11:42] the Spirit descend upon and remain I
[2:11:45] would know that was the Messiah
[2:11:54] and one day he's preaching about
[2:11:57] it and out walks in the
[2:12:02] water a
[2:12:04] man my
[2:12:07] cousin this is
[2:12:14] rigged this is
[2:12:16] rigged
[2:12:19] Jesus him
[2:12:24] but as he's standing there he
[2:12:27] realizes something Supernatural going on
[2:12:31] and he sees the heavens open and and the
[2:12:34] dove come down and come and feel him and
[2:12:38] abide in him and he said this is him
[2:12:42] that I I preached about that would come
[2:12:44] this is the
[2:12:45] Messiah and for three and a half years
[2:12:48] of Mighty Ministry great things happened
[2:12:51] Miracle after Miracle uh prayer lines
[2:12:54] and Miracle lines and healings and blind
[2:12:57] eyes open Dead rais death here all kinds
[2:13:01] of things happen leopards are cleared
[2:13:03] everything the gospel is preached word
[2:13:06] like never before you know here again
[2:13:09] Moses said but I say unto you and here
[2:13:12] he comes with thus sayith the Lord a
[2:13:14] word from heaven and word after word and
[2:13:18] scripture after scripture is being
[2:13:20] fulfilled
[2:13:26] and they got their eyes on the wrong
[2:13:29] coming so they try to make him the
[2:13:33] king he says I was born to be a
[2:13:36] king but not what you're trying to make
[2:13:41] me I've come to fulfill Isaiah
[2:13:44] 53 he was wounded for my
[2:13:47] transgression he was bruised for my
[2:13:50] iniquity the chastisement of my peace
[2:13:52] was upon him and with his
[2:13:55] stripes I am
[2:13:58] healed I've come to do
[2:14:01] that I've
[2:14:03] come as a Shepherd to give my life for
[2:14:06] the
[2:14:09] Sheep I've come for
[2:14:12] Redemption see there's a greater thing
[2:14:14] than making Israel a great nation with a
[2:14:18] mighty
[2:14:19] king the Great great thing is
[2:14:26] redemption and
[2:14:29] then then all of a
[2:14:32] sudden their hope is
[2:14:37] crucified and they're
[2:14:39] sad and they're
[2:14:41] discouraged and Peter
[2:14:44] says I'm just going to go
[2:14:46] fishing I'll just go back to my old
[2:14:49] lifestyle you know I've k G my life
[2:14:51] three and 1/2 years and walk and
[2:14:53] followed this man helped him in prayer

[2:18:11] well I say you cuz it might be because
[2:18:14] goodness and mercy is on your Trail I
[2:18:15] can't see goodness in this it is God
[2:18:18] getting you into a place where you can
[2:18:20] say I know my redeemer
[2:18:32] lives I say again in this day we've seen
[2:18:34] scripture come alive we've seen a rapid
[2:18:38] fulfillment of
[2:18:46] Prophecy scriptures that seem
[2:18:49] dead life
[2:18:51] have sprung to life it's in this
[2:18:54] generation God's done Mighty things as
[2:18:56] he winds up end time
[2:18:59] events and we have arrived at the
[2:19:02] scripture that I read this
[2:19:04] morning as the morning Dawns as the
[2:19:07] wings of the morning
[2:19:09] come we've
[2:19:11] arrived at this place of
[2:19:14] comfort 1 Thessalonians
[2:19:17] 4 and the Rapture cycle
[2:19:20] has
[2:19:24] begun the Rapture cycle is a succession
[2:19:28] of
[2:19:28] events that will finalize with his
[2:19:32] Corporal coming yes we believe in his
[2:19:35] Corporal
[2:19:37] coming We believe We believe that Jesus
[2:19:42] Christ will come physically
[2:19:44] again we will meet him in the
[2:19:48] air I don't understand all about air and
[2:19:51] all about Dimensions but I know we'll
[2:19:53] meet him
[2:19:54] there now as we're saying this we do
[2:19:58] believe because that's what Believers
[2:20:00] believe we believe there's a literal
[2:20:02] Lord Jesus coming from Heaven a physical
[2:20:04] Lord Jesus who we will meet in the air
[2:20:08] Believers believe that amen unbelievers
[2:20:11] don't but we
[2:20:13] do now and no matter how much you
[2:20:15] spiritualize it it still must final
[2:20:18] finalize in the physical Corporal return
[2:20:22] of Jesus Christ that's right or it's all
[2:20:25] in
[2:20:26] vain it's all Air
[2:20:29] Castles smoking
[2:20:33] mirrors Jesus has to come back his word
[2:20:37] said
[2:20:42] so so I don't know well Divine
[2:20:45] intelligence told us
[2:20:48] so well I don't understand
[2:20:51] Divine intelligence well you probably
[2:20:53] don't understand artificial
[2:20:58] intelligence but it ain't an
[2:21:00] understanding it's knowing what God said
[2:21:02] he will
[2:21:05] do that he's going to fulfill his
[2:21:09] word now as we're looking at this the
[2:21:13] Bible tells you clearly of this Rapture
[2:21:16] cycle and brother bam tells us he does
[2:21:18] three things as he descends
[2:21:21] and I'm re referring to brother Brandon
[2:21:23] because that is where Divine
[2:21:26] intelligence came from a prophetic voice
[2:21:30] a prophetic
[2:21:32] insight and we have arrived where the
[2:21:34] Lord himself has descended from heaven
[2:21:37] with a
[2:21:38] shout and that shout is a mighty message
[2:21:43] it is can I say it this way it is the
[2:21:46] presence of Christ in word form now it's
[2:21:50] not as physical coming but still it's
[2:21:53] his
[2:21:56] coming and it's in word form and it has
[2:21:59] been sounded and continues to Echo even
[2:22:01] to this day into every corner of the
[2:22:04] world and this message do not stopped
[2:22:08] progressing it do not stopped reaching
[2:22:10] out into dark Corners to the of the
[2:22:12] globe it it continues as we speak to
[2:22:15] reach out to the predestined seeds to of
[2:22:18] of God to call out that elect the was
[2:22:20] forn from the foundational world it's
[2:22:23] that quick short work that is being done
[2:22:26] a lot of people are looking for it we
[2:22:28] are in
[2:22:29] it so one day it'll come now we it is
[2:22:33] already here we are part of the quick
[2:22:34] short work leot is the age of that quick
[2:22:38] work and we are witnessing first
[2:22:41] Thessalonians 4 we've seen him and is
[2:22:43] coming the son of
[2:22:45] man coming in word form to a prophet as
[2:22:49] he descended with a
[2:22:52] shout now the same anointing the same
[2:22:56] power the the same son of man as he
[2:22:59] descends and today as he descends he
[2:23:03] continues right on from the shout to the
[2:23:07] voice and and that is that is where God
[2:23:11] manifests himself in Bride form where
[2:23:13] the works of the bridegroom is now being
[2:23:17] done in his
[2:23:18] bride and this bride has to fulfill
[2:23:22] Enoch who prophesied the Lord is coming
[2:23:25] with 10,000 of his Saints we are here
[2:23:29] where and we are his Saints and the Lord
[2:23:31] is here and he's working his works the
[2:23:34] works of the bridegroom is now being
[2:23:37] worked to the
[2:23:38] bride 2,000 years ago he came in Groom
[2:23:43] form amen now he is here today on Earth
[2:23:48] in Bride form
[2:23:50] who is it it's the same son of man
[2:23:53] taking on our
[2:23:54] dust manifesting his life and
[2:23:57] manifesting his power oh there there are
[2:23:59] hundreds of scriptures and types that
[2:24:02] are that are in right now in the process
[2:24:04] of being a fulfillment it's the greatest
[2:24:07] hour of fulfillment that the world has
[2:24:09] ever seen Paul believed it was for his
[2:24:12] age but there there was a delay of 2,000
[2:24:15] years of of Gentile Church ages of of
[2:24:19] seven Church ages but in the end he
[2:24:21] promised he would bring forth a bride
[2:24:24] who would be in his very
[2:24:26] image now that's not to say that would
[2:24:29] not was not a bride in other ages but
[2:24:31] we're saying the infant church has
[2:24:34] matured and is now at the time of
[2:24:36] marriage and this is the bride agent and
[2:24:40] she is the elect lady who is the
[2:24:42] Fulfillment and the embodiment of every
[2:24:45] Divine promise of God she is the
[2:24:47] fullness of the godhead or the word of
[2:24:50] God God in a body so all that was made
[2:24:54] known through men like Enoch different
[2:24:57] ones down to the ages Samson as I went
[2:24:59] to it last week one it's all not being
[2:25:02] made manifest in a bride body they were
[2:25:05] prophesying of
[2:25:08] you this bride is God's crowning
[2:25:11] achievement
[2:25:28] she's a spotless bride with ever stain
[2:25:31] of sin
[2:25:32] gone the unbelief of the ages
[2:25:39] erased the opening of The Seven Seals
[2:25:42] gave us a title deed
[2:25:44] book it searched every claim that was
[2:25:47] against the church and removed it
[2:25:51] and you are a spotless bride of Jesus
[2:25:54] Christ standing as though you never
[2:25:56] sinned in the first
[2:25:58] place with the unbelief of the ages
[2:26:01] removed from your
[2:26:03] life and the clutch that Rome has had of
[2:26:07] the great Harlot system on Samson the
[2:26:09] church has now been taken off because
[2:26:12] there's a people back in Covenant with
[2:26:16] God what an age we're living this is the
[2:26:19] marriage of the land
[2:26:20] a spotless bride dressed in the
[2:26:23] righteousness of the word of the hour
[2:26:25] after thousands of years of delay
[2:26:27] remember Paul was looking for that
[2:26:29] fulfillment in his age he wasn't even
[2:26:31] thinking of this age he didn't even know
[2:26:33] we were to be
[2:26:37] here and God would hide it from them in
[2:26:40] that day and brother bam he told Brother
[2:26:42] Bram told him said God hid it because if
[2:26:46] Satan could have got a hold of it he'd
[2:26:48] have done great damage
[2:26:53] so he hid it from them and he wrote in
[2:26:57] symbols and you got a whole book called
[2:27:00] the
[2:27:02] unveiling or the
[2:27:05] Apocalypto the unveiling of
[2:27:08] God and his end time plan and he writes
[2:27:11] it all in symbols in parabolic form and
[2:27:15] he stirs it up for the last day until an
[2:27:19] intelligence would
[2:27:22] come hallelujah amen that would reveal
[2:27:25] the mysteries of God to an end time
[2:27:29] people to give them the faith and
[2:27:31] position them in the
[2:27:38] promise I feel the Holy Ghost all over
[2:27:42] me let me just tell you where we're
[2:27:44] standing at after thousands of years of
[2:27:47] delay we are standing right in the
[2:27:50] Fulfillment of scripture and scripture
[2:27:53] that was once symbols and Mysteries and
[2:27:57] parabolic form now we
[2:28:01] know and that intelligence ought to give
[2:28:04] you a
[2:28:06] power to overcome in this age and to
[2:28:10] drive out the spirit of
[2:28:13] Darkness to make you know you are the
[2:28:16] Overcomer here in the Leo to C and age
[2:28:19] and you you will rise above everything
[2:28:22] the devil has brought against
[2:28:26] you
[2:28:29] Hallelujah Paul would say we which our
[2:28:32] alive and remain he thought he
[2:28:35] was he didn't know it was for another
[2:28:38] age another
[2:28:40] time much like when Isaiah prophesied
[2:28:44] I'll show you a sign you want a sign
[2:28:46] I'll show you one Behold a virgin shall
[2:28:49] conceive
[2:28:53] what I imagine if anybody ever want to
[2:28:55] cram words back in his mouth he
[2:28:58] did but he
[2:29:00] said she'll bring forth a son he'll be
[2:29:03] called
[2:29:04] Emanuel this is a sign but it'd be 700
[2:29:08] and something years before the sign
[2:29:10] would be
[2:29:14] shown God spoke a word and it would lay
[2:29:18] dormant until the
[2:29:22] season and what I'm telling you we are
[2:29:24] in the
[2:29:28] season we are in the season because
[2:29:31] we're seeing the wings of the
[2:29:33] morning as the sun
[2:29:40] rises you
[2:29:44] see it would be the longsuffering of
[2:29:47] God that would give the Gentiles a
[2:29:49] chance
[2:29:52] and the bride is going to be there
[2:29:54] because she's chosen a god before the
[2:29:56] foundational world the heart purpose of
[2:29:58] God was to have a bride of his own
[2:30:02] choosing and I'll just tell you God will
[2:30:05] not give up on his
[2:30:06] plan amen the and the bride will not be
[2:30:10] a part of the Harlot system she will be
[2:30:14] a Chase virgin true to him in every way
[2:30:17] she she will not take on the seeds of
[2:30:19] man organized religion but she will be
[2:30:22] the Spotless bride of Christ and yet
[2:30:25] it's written in all the types of the
[2:30:27] Bible I mean how many do we have to go
[2:30:30] through Joseph is while exiled and
[2:30:33] rejected by his Brethren received a
[2:30:36] gentile bride and then sent her to the
[2:30:39] Palace where when the time came to
[2:30:42] reveal itself to his
[2:30:44] bre think of that while he's away while
[2:30:47] he's while he's been pushed away and
[2:30:49] away from his brother the rejected
[2:30:51] Christ Joseph got a gentile
[2:30:55] bride think about Moses the same you
[2:30:58] know here he is a strained from his
[2:31:00] Brethren rejected and you know here here
[2:31:03] they had a chance for the deliverer and
[2:31:05] then rather than getting behind the the
[2:31:07] the Deliverance what did they do they
[2:31:10] they made fun of it and and Moses run
[2:31:13] and while he's away he gets a gentile
[2:31:17] bride look again look at some of these
[2:31:20] Gentile Brides it was Rahab the type of
[2:31:23] the Gentile bride redeemed from among
[2:31:26] the Damned people of Jericho who was
[2:31:30] utterly destroyed and redeemed from that
[2:31:33] and
[2:31:35] elevated to a great lady in Israel
[2:31:39] mother of the Messiah elevated by
[2:31:45] marriage don't you know it's your union
[2:31:48] with Christ that is elevated you to
[2:31:51] where you are you an outcast of damn
[2:31:55] people lost but God redeemed you and
[2:31:59] brought you out under a token under a
[2:32:02] message in this day and hour and set you
[2:32:05] apart to call you his
[2:32:08] own Ruth type of the Gentile bride
[2:32:13] brought to the promised land following
[2:32:15] the the Jewish woman Naomi declaring
[2:32:19] you're people will be my people and my
[2:32:22] God your God my
[2:32:25] God isn't that
[2:32:30] so isn't that so aren't we that Ruth
[2:32:35] what do you think about Abraham your
[2:32:36] people is my
[2:32:38] people that's my
[2:32:42] father come on Church me what what about
[2:32:45] David that that's that's that's my
[2:32:48] that's my king there
[2:32:51] amen we identify with all of those in
[2:32:53] the Bible why because we are that Ruth
[2:32:56] your people are my people your God the
[2:32:59] Jehovah of the Old Testament is the
[2:33:01] Jesus of the new hallelujah amen your
[2:33:05] people is our people amen your God is my
[2:33:08] God isn't that where we stand are you
[2:33:11] that Ruth this
[2:33:13] morning Hallelujah and Ruth wanted more
[2:33:16] than a handful of barley she wanted more
[2:33:19] than even fills of grain she wanted Boaz
[2:33:22] and if I know your heart this morning
[2:33:24] it's more than just having a nice church
[2:33:27] and having a little worship and having a
[2:33:29] nice song but what you really want is
[2:33:34] boas give me that
[2:33:37] [Applause]
[2:33:40] life she craved that seed and brought
[2:33:43] forth the king for out of her out of
[2:33:47] Boaz came Jesse out of Jesse came David
[2:33:50] to sit on the throne and then he was
[2:33:53] only reflecting the great king to
[2:33:56] come Jesus
[2:34:00] Christ all of these were prophesying but
[2:34:03] God buried it in the
[2:34:06] scripture he kept it a secret in types
[2:34:09] and
[2:34:10] shadows but to you he breaks the seals
[2:34:15] on the secret it's the work of the lover
[2:34:19] the bride bridegroom Whispering love
[2:34:21] secrets to his
[2:34:26] bride we're at the time where the
[2:34:31] scripture of his
[2:34:33] coming is in the process of
[2:34:36] fulfillment as the light comes on the
[2:34:38] wings of the
[2:34:40] morning it's not meant to be a scripture
[2:34:42] of the
[2:34:44] past and I've said it over and over and
[2:34:47] I say it again this morning
[2:34:50] it's no longer a scripture of the future
[2:34:53] that we need to refer to at some funeral
[2:34:55] where we try to give a word of
[2:34:58] comfort our comfort is it's
[2:35:06] happening h brother Tim well I I I I I
[2:35:09] just don't know I I just don't know
[2:35:11] about
[2:35:14] this I just don't know about this you
[2:35:16] know you're you're you're talking about
[2:35:19] how you know how he comes and how he
[2:35:21] descends with from heaven with the shout
[2:35:23] and that it's a mighty message and and
[2:35:26] it's all of this well you know maybe we
[2:35:29] need to look in the prophecy let's go
[2:35:32] down to Exodus
[2:35:34] 3 I don't have this in
[2:35:36] my scriptures this morning but Exodus
[2:35:42] 3 it's not in my
[2:35:45] notes bear with me a second
[2:35:50] let's go to verse
[2:35:54] one and we're going to read down
[2:35:58] through about verse
[2:36:02] seven or
[2:36:06] eight now Moses kept the flock of Jethro
[2:36:09] his
[2:36:11] father-in-law the priest of Midian and
[2:36:13] he led the the flock to the backside of
[2:36:16] the desert and came to the Mountain of
[2:36:18] God even the horb and the angel of the
[2:36:22] Lord appeared unto him in a flame of
[2:36:25] fire out the midst of a bush so now here
[2:36:29] we have him one of the very first
[2:36:32] occurrences of the pillar of fire being
[2:36:37] visible and in the midst of a
[2:36:40] bush and he looked and behold the bush
[2:36:43] burned with fire and the Bush was not
[2:36:46] consumed and Moses said I will now turn
[2:36:49] aside
[2:36:50] and see the great sight why the bush is
[2:36:55] not
[2:36:56] burnt and when the Lord saw that he
[2:36:58] turned aside to see God who was it
[2:37:03] thought it was just an
[2:37:04] angel God called unto him out of the
[2:37:09] midst of the
[2:37:11] Bush and said Moses Moses and he said
[2:37:14] here am
[2:37:17] I what's now the next verse
[2:37:21] and he said draw not nigh hither and put
[2:37:24] off thy shoes from off th feet for the
[2:37:26] place where on thou standest is Holy
[2:37:28] Ground I'll tell you an age of time when
[2:37:31] when the pillar of fire is seen is a
[2:37:33] holy grounds and you're standing on it
[2:37:37] and he said and he said moreover he said
[2:37:39] I am not I was oh I love this listen
[2:37:44] what his theme is of his message Jesus
[2:37:47] Christ the same yesterday today forever
[2:37:50] I
[2:37:51] am not I will be I was I am God is
[2:37:56] present T he is the I am
[2:38:00] God I am the god of thy father the god
[2:38:04] of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god
[2:38:06] of Jacob and can I say he's the god of
[2:38:08] Samson he's the god of Abraham he's the
[2:38:11] god of Ruth he's the God come on Church
[2:38:15] he's a god of the
[2:38:17] disciples he's the god of Mary Magdalene
[2:38:20] out of whom he cast Seven Devils and he
[2:38:23] did the same thing for you and this age
[2:38:25] and cast out the Devils the tormenters
[2:38:28] of the ages out of your life so you can
[2:38:31] be a people
[2:38:33] free you can be a people
[2:38:36] free the Creeds of man no longer hold
[2:38:39] you the Demons of Torment no longer
[2:38:41] bound
[2:38:43] you I am the
[2:38:45] god of Mary Magdalene
[2:38:49] I'm the god of Abraham the god of Isaac
[2:38:52] the god of Jacob and Jesus would said he
[2:38:54] is a God not of the dead but of the
[2:38:56] living and this proves they're still
[2:39:00] alive they're in another realm moving a
[2:39:02] little come on now moving a little
[2:39:06] faster than this one but they're in
[2:39:07] another realm but they're there and
[2:39:09] they're very much
[2:39:12] alive you don't believe it I mean there
[2:39:14] are books that are written by by medical
[2:39:17] doctors I can give you titles
[2:39:21] of them what you know that I I've read
[2:39:23] that that I have poured over and that
[2:39:25] I've
[2:39:28] looked because when my wife passed
[2:39:31] away I not only looked into the message
[2:39:34] into the
[2:39:37] Bible but I
[2:39:40] wonder she's gone where is
[2:39:44] she I hear a brother Bisal tell of a
[2:39:48] believer in South Africa who had an
[2:39:52] Affliction he's going get needed surgery
[2:39:54] he goes and gets the
[2:39:58] surgery comes back from the surgery to
[2:40:01] the recovery room somebody Kinks his O
[2:40:05] oxygen hose and the nurse does something
[2:40:08] chokes him off and he dies his machines
[2:40:11] are going
[2:40:13] on and there he could not talk he could
[2:40:17] not alert anybody and he's dying he's
[2:40:21] he's his heart has stopped
[2:40:23] beating and
[2:40:25] he he leaves his body and he is standing
[2:40:29] up there looking back down in another
[2:40:32] body looking back at his body on the
[2:40:35] gurnie and they come running in from
[2:40:38] everywhere and grab his gurnie and Rush
[2:40:41] him to the operating room and he follows
[2:40:43] him down the hall into the operating
[2:40:45] room exactly where it is he can describe
[2:40:48] every bit of it where they was how they
[2:40:50] were dressed who was there even the
[2:40:52] physician who came back in his everyday
[2:40:54] clothes as he was called on the
[2:40:55] emergency call running down the hall he
[2:40:58] can see every bit of it and he watches
[2:41:01] them as they work over his body in a
[2:41:02] moment he will enter back into his body
[2:41:04] and will wake
[2:41:09] up medical
[2:41:18] doctors and I believe it was a medical
[2:41:20] doctor who was reporting this in in one
[2:41:22] of the the
[2:41:24] accounts she said that she left her
[2:41:28] body there in the operating
[2:41:31] room and as she did she moved up out of
[2:41:35] it and was looking down at and working
[2:41:37] on her
[2:41:39] body and said as I was there I noticed
[2:41:42] on the top of the fan
[2:41:46] blade on top of a fan blade up there was
[2:41:50] a a little red
[2:41:54] sticker and he said I come back into my
[2:41:57] body I was telling the
[2:42:00] Physicians what I seen how that I did
[2:42:04] they wouldn't listen they get a intern
[2:42:07] he wouldn't listen to get a nurse and
[2:42:09] she's listening kind of sympathetically
[2:42:11] you know they're crazy they need to go
[2:42:13] to the psych ward and everything else
[2:42:15] and here she
[2:42:17] is she says look look if you don't
[2:42:20] believe
[2:42:21] me I've told you how you were dressed I
[2:42:24] told you to describe the instruments you
[2:42:25] used in the surgery I I showed you
[2:42:29] everything and said you still won't
[2:42:31] believe me but if one of you will get up
[2:42:33] on a step ladder and look down on that
[2:42:35] fan and look down on the top of that
[2:42:38] blade right up there you'll see the red
[2:42:40] sticker that I saw while I was there and
[2:42:43] she convinced him to climb up get a
[2:42:46] ladder and climb up and take a look and
[2:42:48] there it was right there as he as he saw
[2:42:51] it when you die you go
[2:42:56] somewhere you have another
[2:42:59] body amen and I want you just to realize
[2:43:03] here as we are thinking about it here

[2:43:09] where those that are in that other
[2:43:12] dimension are about to come
[2:43:14] here that the scripture that we're

[2:43:20] seeing the full fulfillment where we
[2:43:22] covered one another with these words I
[2:43:25] want to say we have received a mighty
