wasn't kidding when he said be ready I was expecting 30 minutes service and that's we're here now so hey man let's just bow our hearts for a few moments and we'll begin to change the order of the service amen do you believe once again and I'm not just trying to ask this question out of tradition but do you believe once again that God can meet your need tonight now I know that he's met needs this morning felt his presence he touched my heart and I know that he's touched yours but perhaps there's another thing that we can get tonight something else that we can draw from from the well tonight I mean that's why we're here right I don't think that this is just something to pass the time to get to the communion but there's something else that God has for me so I want to just lift my hand personally say Lord I want to be I want to be an antenna I want to receive your word in my heart amen Heavenly fathers would come before you Lord we just know this evening Lord that you have something else for those that are here father I know this is not normal for their their schedule and time and by natural things Lord maybe we're we're some are already in bed or maybe someone's just whatever they're doing so we have now stopped time completely from our normal life and we find ourselves back in this place in their in your presence so Lord I believe that you have something for them Lord I want to step out of the way and ask that you would just deal directly to every heart and God that it would go in and it would be a change father and Lord if there'd be something again I I think it's something that should be said every time someone needs the baptism of the Holy Spirit may they find that Lord a refreshing Lord whatever it may be let us be open for that tonight we ask that you would just move in a special way once again we get we just give you praise honor and glory for it in Jesus name amen well we're going to do something different I usually sing slow songs but I was I figured you guys are on kind of food coma now so how many is uh ready for work tomorrow great answer how many is on their way to heaven [Music] and you know no matter what Satan tries to do he can't stop what God's doing already and then so we're just gonna sing this song we sing at home perhaps you know it if you would sing it with me well I'm on my way to heaven and I'm so glad now if I see your face and you just don't have that same Zeal I might have to come down there and pull you up here and sing with me well I'm on my way to heaven and I'm so you know I'm on my way to heaven and I'm so glad I'm on my way to heaven and I'm so glad you know the devil can't do me no I'm singing again now well I'm on my way to head and I'm sore are you glad yes I'm on my way to heaven and I'm so glad I'm on my way [Music] you know the devil can't do will I remember the day that I found him and I remember the day I made the stars and I remember the day that I nailed at the altar had he changed all this oh boy well I'm on my way to heaven and I'm sold that well I'm on my way to heaven and I'm so relaxed yes I'm on my way to heaven and I'm so glad you know the devil can't do it no harm now listen now well there's no use to tell me that God is not living and there's no use to weave that evil spell for I just talked this morning to the great and higher power and he said he is alive and well he's alive well I'm on my way to heaven I'm on my way [Music] that verse again [Music] [Music] tonight [Music] but I'm devils [Music] the devil can do your time [Music] okay [Music] [Music] oh Alexander me no harm Glory [Applause] what's your vision of what God can do for you the devil can't stop that if you're carnal tonight and say well I've got this problem I've got that problem and you're thinking well it's but let me just tell you that's called life the devil cannot stop what God's already doing amen I'll never forget the day uh I had brother Ron Spencer here a few years back at our church and the first night of service that we were having in our anniversary meetings and it was my first time I believe it was to actually invite a minister so it's kind of the burdens on me and you know I I guess I'm just different I was a pastor that was scared to death I was just like his brother Ron Spencer and what's going on you know this power of God is going to move and then all of a sudden we had this big blow up in the church something happened and somebody got mad and somebody walked on I know y'all never have that so just you know nobody ever gets angry and I'm just sitting there and I just it's all over my face and we're sitting in the office there and brother Ron's sitting there and he just looks at me and says don't you worry buddy he said the devil didn't start this train and this train ain't stopping [Applause] amen well I know you've been standing so there's a reason for you standing but you'll be sitting shortly turn your bibles if you wouldn't mind with me to the Book of Joshua chapter 24. this is the thought that the Lord laid upon my heart uh actually a couple years ago and then just recently again just brought it back to my attention and I haven't been able to get away from it this week so we trust that it would be something for a few moments I've been given 20 minutes so I need brother Derek to time me brother Derek Paris I've been told you your 20 minutes is what I need so but I trust that tonight uh what we what we feel in our hearts will get to the need of the situation now this is very common Joshua 24 14. so we read this together it says now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord and if it seemed evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites and whose land you dwell but listen this is more than just a picture on a wall but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord now I'm just going to quickly read Psalms 121 1-2 it says I will lift mine eyes unto the hills from wince cometh my help My Help Cometh From The Lord which made Heaven and Earth I mean God bless you can be seated as we as we dive into this quickly and we and we understand the time we want to be honorable of that the road demands that you're on this this evening the road that you are on demands a decision it demands a decision now what you heard this morning from brother Tim that wasn't brother Tim bringing forth oh something to you that he's demanding a decision from you if brother Aaron or brother Joe or brother Timothy was ministering uh brother Branham could be ministering and they are not making you or demanding a decision from you but God every single time we listen to a tape every single time we come to the house of God and we hear the words uh ministered from this Pulpit or wherever you go you are brought forth to a question a chance or a Crossroads now we understand many times of life that we all come to specific Crossroads and a lot of times we look at Crossroads decisions of whether it's going to be my career decision or marriage decision or whatever it may be and a lot of times we tend to focus too much on those types of things instead of the the most important Eternal decision but I want us to understand tonight as our as our thought is entitled the road ahead demands it the road ahead demands a decision we must have a personal experience that solidifies our purpose now I I I'm just going to be honest with you tonight okay you ever just been stopped in the middle of your job that's perfect see it's got to be right thank you brother the road ahead demands and I love it so I was sitting there this morning and a lot of the things that God had been dealing with me brother Tim was was just line for line speaking I was like God how in the world what are you trying to do and if I could speak to my church this one tonight and tell them that it's not just us speaking to you that you have a decision but every Church you go to Every individual every young person we have to make a decision Matthew 16 13-16 you you know the scripture here but let's just read it together when Jesus came into the coast of assessori Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias and others jeremius or one of the prophets and he said unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God now let's just stop for a minute and understand that the first question that Jesus asked had no value it's a pretty non-life-threatening question it invoked No Authority no authority over your life nothing whom do men say that I am when Jesus asked the question so if I want to go to ask brother Joe brother Joe what what does Timothy say about servant lord well brother Joel this is it you all know how his answer would be right you can just see brother Joe answer if I went to Brother Aaron I said well what does brother Tim believe he could tell me brother Tim believes this and this it has no pressure it is no there's no heart in it there's no Authority in it it's do you uh you know what does your church believe well my church believes this well my pastor believes this Whoa We Believe God sent a prophet and we put everything off on what the prophet said or he put everything on off what brother Tim says and we put everything on off but Jesus didn't stop with that type of question he says there if if this question is how it ended there was no need to respond with a you're with your heart there's no need to respond with your actions to commit yourself I wonder if that's what religion has become because we're all looking up everyone else and not ourself if Jesus would have stopped there maybe that wouldn't have been important of scripture but I want you to know that the road ahead Demands a decision what you're about to go through Peter what you're about to face you need to know who I am you see so it's so as long as the question of the identity of Jesus is discussed at the level of intellect or at the level of academics there is no claim on your heart you see that's why I don't like to get into baits on Facebook I don't want to get I don't even want to get in a debate at McDonald's because it becomes an intellectual debate of my opinion of the word or how I think it should be but I wanted to come from my heart I want it to be a heartfelt thing you see there was no claim on the heart in the first question there was no claim on the life because men say that you're this way well brother Tim believes this well brother Ron believes this well brother Jeremy believes this but what do you believe tonight because what you're going to go through if you don't make a decision in your life you are not going to make it the road ahead demands a heartfelt decision the one who formed us together in our mother's wombs will not be satisfied with a place in the conversation of critics he wants to be more than a debate he wants to be more than him come on do you message theology he wants to be more than this is my interpretation of the word he doesn't want to be just a part of academics but he wants to be a part of your heart he's not going to be satisfied he will always lay claim in your heart so if I ask you the question what does this person believe it makes no personal pressure on you that's why Jesus didn't end there said but who do you say that I am and now the question is thrown to you who do you say that I am well you're a God of Miracles and we begin to think of everybody else's Miracles oh you're a God that can open the blinded eyes but we we look at everybody else but what is God to you tonight because you've got to know who he is because what you're about to go through you need to have a personal experience Moses you cannot make you cannot go to Egypt with what you had before you've got to have a backside of the desert experience you need to have a come to Jesus moments because what you're about to go through oh brother Jeremy I've already been through it I've already had these trials I've already had these tests everything's already fallen apart the car ain't going to start I've had this cancer I've had this disease I've had that disease but what you're about to go through you need to know who Jesus is I'm afraid if we're not careful it's becoming more it's becoming more of a religious thing and Jesus said I don't want to know what you say everyone else says I don't want you to tell me what your church believes I want to know what you believe see but if I ask you what you believe now it's on your heart now the pressure's on you see John 13 34 says a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you that you also love one another by this shall part man no amen are y'all with me all men know that ye are my disciples if you loved one with one another this is intriguing because it says all men this is not an undercover relationship this is not well you know I can't go to Walmart today because someone might look at me and they might they might not like the way I dress uh you know my Facebook is has nothing to do with with Christ or uh you know it's all good when everybody's here together and we all look the same and act the same but when you get separated and you're on your own who do you say that Jesus is you see it's not up to just the ministry to encourage somebody to keep pressing on because you never know when you're at Walmart and somebody's in need of a touch of God will you be one that is recognizing that Jesus has called to use you the road ahead demands a decision tonight communion is more than just an ordinance it Demands a decision baptism is more than an ordinance but it Demands a decision a life changing decision something that is more than just a uh the just water on skin or something more than drinking of the wine something more than eating of the bread but it's a life-changing decision this is a central question one that Jesus posed many times and in many ways many times in many ways how many times did people come you even look at the Rich Young Ruler I believe good Master what must I do to be saved Minister this here recently A lot of times our our relationship with Christ has to do with we tied into the natural way of life because we in our Humanity we are doers we have needs we go to jobs to meet the needs right we we uh we go to birthdays we go to uh get-togethers we have Fellowship we support our family we are doers we go to the church we say uh what can I do to help it becomes something that we do we fulfill a need but Jesus was wanting to look for more than just doers now follow me I know the Bible speaks of doers but he's looking for somebody more than is just doing it because there's a natural need let's see if your marriage is based upon not to be burned your marriage is not right come on you know the scripture and if you you know rather than burn might as well get married come on if you hello folks you all know the scripture I have just given you a Bible study tonight find it but let's just be honest if that's all our relationship is that's not relationship that's a based on need and it doesn't work and if that's the way church has become well I'm going to be a church because I don't want to burn that's not relationship Jesus is looking not for just doers but people that have a heart and a hunger and a desire and a thirst God I want more than just to take communion tonight but this is the bread this is the wine this is my desire the road ahead demands at church you've got to look at it's more than just religion you see Saul answering the question became Paul the self-proclaimed slave of Christ Stephen answering the question of who Jesus was by being filled with the Holy Spirit and preached the most passionate sermon in history before being stoned to death while pleading the Forgiveness of his murders you tell me somebody that knew the road ahead and it did not just come by a theological sermon or an academic sermon or a mental sermon but it came by a sermon that was preached with heart and desire that it doesn't matter what anyone says to me it doesn't matter what anyone says against me I will pray for them while he was being stoned he was praying for them the road requires a decision young people the road requires decision parents the decision is eternal and one that will make and some have made already I know that some don't believe in final calls but I do so just bear with me for a minute I'm sorry brother Tim but that's I believe in it you say why do you believe in that because I've been a part of them you say why'd you say you're sorry brother Tim because I don't know I just felt like saying that brother Tim have you ever seen it before God calling people for one last time you see we in our Humanity we don't like finality finality is hard to understand we always feel like there's a chance we feel this time there's a chance I got no no no problem with that understanding because we don't want to give up right but we have a hard time with finality but I want you to understand that there is a line I don't want to come close to that line but I've seen him growing up in the church I I've been a part of a church of my grandfather as we were raised up we were raised up on the baptism of the Holy Ghost we were raised upon the gifts being active in the church but being filled with the Holy Spirit letting the word be opened in your life and you have to make a decision because just saying God sent a prophet was not enough for you you had to believe that God sent a prophet absolutely but you needed to do what the prophet said he said be born again what did he do he was pointing us back to the word of God so there were many times that I would see God as a young person as a child dealing with people in the church and dealing I grew up with with with friends of mine that we stayed the night together we were friends we we uh we we were always there with one another and they heard the same sermon that I heard they were under the same anointing preaching that I heard they heard the same tongues they were part of the same shouting they were part of the same revealed word of God and some are so far away from God today have cursed God say so what does that do to you that makes me humble how in the world could I be in the position I'm in today you see I fought pornography I fought suicide I fought all of these things but until I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I kept fighting them until you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're always going to keep fighting and you're always going to keep trying and the more you try the more tired you're going to get and the more you try the more the more sleep you're going to lose at night you want to know a real peace the real peace is complete surrender to God to be honest with one another that we're all in this battle together and that we're not here to do it alone and God wants you to surrender to completely to him because the road you are on demands it well brother Jeremy it can't get any worse don't say it I got to get back to this this is not a question asked by your typical everyday rabbi even the question itself makes a statement there is something much more important about me than what they say yeah oh my there is something much more important wrapped up in my identity than most people realize you see it's more than just coming to church and looking apart and acting apart I want more than this to shout I want the god of the shout I want more than just a uh just to run around a church I want the god of that okay I got to testify so I'm sitting over there you know and I know my church is going on and I've been talking with brother J.R who ministered for me this morning speaking of our burdens this morning he was in tears and just God just been dealing and so I've been been on my heart today so I'm sitting over there and also I started getting some text from from people in the church and God began to move and he exploded in the church and and I got a text from my mom she said your son your oldest son he shouted and ran around the church and was praising God now some of you might be oh what's the big deal but let me just tell you something about my son my oldest he's like me we don't want to be in front of people we don't want to do anything in front of people and it's got to be God for it to happen I'm going to go back a little bit further I'm going to talk about just I want to talk about this here last year as a pastor God has used me at times and it's it's it's maybe to some it's easy but to me it's not that when I know God is calling somebody and I know that it's a serious call it could be a decision that they that they're fixing to have to make it could be it could be their final call sometimes I don't know but I know that it's a very serious need and most of the time that I've seen it happen most of the time if they did not make the right decision they were out of church within a certain amount of time and that's not so much just calling their name it's just God calling I've got nothing wrong with that that's happened in our church before so one of the services I was that I was in and the power of God was moving through the place and many people were were surrendering to God but there was this there was this catch somebody wasn't breaking through and and at first you know as ministers we we we wait on the Lord Lord how far do you want me to go because we can't push it into action we heard that this morning we can't do it so we have to wait on the Lord Lord what do you want us to do and I was praying and we were singing and I just I had everyone bow their heads and and I just said you know who you are God is calling you to be honest he's calling you to lift your hand and to say that I know I need the baptism of the Holy Ghost I know I need a change and no hands went up brother Aaron you've probably been in a situation before my heart was just tearing inside because they're my people they're my sheep and I want them to be free and so I said God and my heart said God would you reveal it to me and when God revealed it to me he said it's your son all right what am I going to do now because now in my heart I know that my oldest boy has to make a decision and that me as a daddy has to keep going I can't stop now and I know that if my son doesn't make the decision that this could be the greatest decision of his life that if he doesn't surrender to God this could be the moment where he walks out and I began to beg God brother Tim and my heart I said God give him one more chance I had everyone bow their heads I said Lord I give them one more chance but I know I've got to do this because this is my calling Daddy has to step aside now I said now you know who you are and nobody opened your eyes but the one person that God is calling and I'm looking right at my son the one person that God is calling I want you to open your eyes and look right at me and he opened his eyes and looked right at him as soon as he seen me in his eyes he melted immediately and I said now you have gone this far now you can't this is not an undercover decision I said now everybody lift your hands and or lift your eyes and I said now you know who you are you have to make a conscious decision I want God more than what anyone else in this church thinks and at that moment my son lifted up his hands and he just began to cry out to God oh I'm gonna tell you this as a pastor yes that's great but as a daddy that meant everything to me and I'll never forget it brother Tim I go over there to lay my hands on my son to pray for him and as I went to lay my hands on him the spirit moved for me to brother J.R and brother J.R took over the prayer and God allowed me to take it in as a father I took it in as a father and I prayed for him as a daddy and then as soon as he was done God moved the spirit back upon me and others begin to give their life to God I want to tell you that that moment was a decision for him because what he was about to go through he needed to know who Jesus was more than what daddy said more than what mama said more than what the prophet said he needed to know who he was for himself Hallelujah and I grew up hearing my grandpa say this and uh maybe brother Branham said it but I always heard my grandpa say that I believe it was this statement is that there's no God has no grandchildren you say what do you mean by that that means my grandpa didn't give me any special favors he pulled me from the drums when I did things that I shouldn't do he told me you got to get right I can't have that Spirit on my platform you need to be sold out to God you need to live right you see I didn't do this because I wanted to do it we don't do this because we want to do it if you do it because you want to do it you're going to fall away there's got to be a pull inside of you there's got to be a deed calling to the Deep to know that there's a deep out there to respond I want to know more than just a dead letter I want it to be alive in me because what I'm about to go through I need to know who Jesus is I need to know him personally I need to know him more personally than I do my own wife I need to know him more personally than I do my own husband as you would say I need to know him more personally that because you never know when your spouse will be taken from you you'll never know when your spouse will walk away but do you know who Jesus is Hallelujah who do you say he is tonight do you know him as the way Jesus said I'm the way the truth of life and no man cometh unto the father but by me it cannot be well this is what the pastor believes what if what's going to happen when the pastor dies what are you going to say then well it's what the prophet said well he died what are you going to do now I know I know the spirit to move on but I'm trying to tell you I'm trying to bring this out all right speaking of ananias of Paul or speaking to ananias of Paul in Acts 9 15. it says but the Lord said unto him go that way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and Kings and the children of Israel for I will show him how great things he is going to do for the kingdom no what does it say here I will show him how great things he must suffer also so you're in the message so are do you really want to be a part of this scripture because Paul what you're about to go through the decisions you're going to have to make you're going to have to have an experience Paul Moses you're going to have to have an experience before you go to Egypt for what you're about to face Peter you're going to have to just have come to more of a position than just saying I know who you are you're going to have to get me inside of you you're gonna have to have an upper room oh I just wish they would stop preaching on the Holy Ghost oh I just been every day that every time they preach us on the Holy Ghost and I'm just getting weary of it we'll get it get the Holy Ghost I'm going to tell you what it's the greatest thing that'll ever happen to you because you're gonna finally stop fighting [Applause] you might not understand that statement yet but when you get the Holy Ghost it'll be a revelation to you because the road ahead Demands a decision the life the trials ahead demand a decision the sicknesses that you're going to go through and there's testimonies here tonight that are sitting before me who have went through some strong battles you've seen death you've seen hearted a heartache you've seen disease you've seen horrible things you've had people curse your name you've had you've seen people curse this message but you're still here why are you still here it's not because of one sermon that was preached it's not because of how good you did it's because you let go and let God brother Branham says he says I say 500 years from tonight he said this little group that's sitting here will be somewhere that's right and wherever wherever we are then will will be where we'll have to spend eternity and tonight it may be a decision time and the last time that some of us will have to make our decision but brother Jeremy there's always a chance I don't want to take away hope tonight can you allow me to just preach for a minute I believe that as long as there's breath in anyone's body There's Hope right we've seen prodigals come in my the testimonies are great and wonderful but we've got to get we've got to I believe that Satan to some has put this this a blanket over people or there's always a chance I can go out and do these things and come back but I want you to understand that that's not always the case the Bible is not filled with thousands and thousands of prodigals it's not filled with thousands and thousands of people coming back it's filled with people that came to church and said what must I do to be saved came to an altar pray for me I want to be right but walked out sorrowful because it was too much of a task to let go and we're coming to the end of all time do you not know the season that we're in I know you do because you're well taught here the end of the Gentile dispensation we are at the time of the open book we're at the time of the the revealed word of God it's it's it's beyond restoration if you would allow me to say that it's been restored and now revealed and what does the bible tell us we come to a point that anyone that is filthy let him be filthy still somewhere along the way somewhere the door shuts can I ask you a question did Noah close the door who closed the door well brother Tim he's just preaching too hard brother Aaron he's just too hard I could go down the line of all you wonderful ministers but I must for sake of time oh they're just too hard this teared up they're not the one that shuts the door but some of you don't understand the squeeze that's in the heart of a Preacher the feeling the burden that God gives a Ministry that that I'm thankful that it doesn't always that's not always there because you want to do everything you can to get the attention of the people to let them know that you do not know well I can live the rest of my life listen I'm not talking about natural deaths I'm talking about spiritual too the road that you're about to go through Demands a decision you're going to go home you're going to go back to your jobs what decision did you make today well I made the right decision we'll see what happens it's got to be more than flesh each age had its Choice can you say man well if I if I read the Bible correctly we're we're past all those first six right right so that means that their decision is already done made the sevens right how long how much longer do we have how much longer do you have to make a decision each age had a decision and there's consequences that go with each decision and you have to make a decision in your life and what is that decision it's not about decision you know what consequences are you buy the wrong thing what's the consequence it didn't work so what do you do take it back get your money back that's not how church works something doesn't come out the way we want it we take it back give it to Goodwill whatever it may be no big deal no sweat off our back but what about the Eternal decision that you made on a Wednesday night of when we didn't think it really mattered because it was only a Wednesday night it was the same minister it's a Sunday morning it was the same Minister we've heard the same word he's going to preach about the coming of the Lord he's going to preach about the bride he's going to preach about the Holy Ghost what's the big deal those words that are coming out of his mouth are the words of life that's God demanding a decision from you well I know brother Tim or you know I could say probably all of your family but I don't know he's my family he's my friend doesn't matter brother Tim when it comes or any Minister it's not about how we feel about you it's about God and when the word is being brought forth It's not brother Tim demanding you a decision it's the word that's demanding a decision oh but we don't need that anymore because we have so much message under our belt we have so much knowledge that nobody can now preach my thoughts nobody can now preach my dedication I am more dedicated I am more I have more knowledge nobody can outdo it even you brother Tim can I know you're gonna have to really study hard to outwit me you know there's a group of people that left under sacrificial blood and they're all dead well we're Israel Glory Hallelujah we've seen the the waters part we've seen all of these wonderful Miracles we're out of Egypt and they are all dead only two made it across see I think that as I'm not trying to discourage you tonight but we're leading up to this portion of communion I think that it should be serious as it demands a decision tonight the road demands an elect to catch a difference this hour demands a body an elect few to not just look at the book oh that's a good book but we have to take the book and then it's we have to eat the book and it when you eat this word just allow me to go this Direction please when you eat this word it's going to do something to you it's going to affect your life if you come up here and you say you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and there's no change in your life you didn't eat the book there's too many anointing Junkies but I'm not here to just be have an anointing I want to eat the book and it's going to change me it's going to cut away things in my life it's going to be circumcision oh brother Tim preach circumcision oh brother Tim Timothy preached circumcision preach the word of God why because my soul depends on it it depends on it what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost it's not how high as we heard this morning you can jump what did Brother Branham say it was he said as if you it's receiving the word of Truth for the day in which you live see Jesus never did he said Jesus never did stress the importance of works as he did the word he knew that if people got the word the word The Works would follow you see if I stopped there then I could have ended it with like most people do well I guess that means we don't have to have works I guess that means we don't have to have a shout and service we don't have to get emotional well okay moving on now Jesus knew there was going to be a terrible drift away from the word in the pergament church age and which was at yet 200 years off the patman's vision he knew the drift would cause them to go into the Dark Ages he knew that the way men originally got away from God was by first leaving the word if you leave the word church you've left God I'm going to skip down to this man this this this this just blessed my heart I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst what do you mean what do you mean by brother what do you mean by that brother Jeremy I wonder if we are impressed with the word of God that is being preached if you say oh I I am impressed then why are we looking for other things why are we trying to feel it with other things of the world why are we trying to fill it with our ideas it becomes idolatry to put our ideas over the things of God and even the chosen uh tribes of Israel too were blotted out because of idolatry leaders of idolatry I I can't remember the tribe right now but one of the tribes brother Joe even made it to their Promised Land but because they were surrounded by the enemy they lost faith in the word and left their promise and made their City somewhere else how many of us have made it to the promised land I'm going to remind you that you are going to be surrounded the enemy doesn't want you to have it why do you think you're fighting so hard why do you think that addiction is fighting you so hard why do you think the world is pulling at you so hard because you're at the moment of breakthrough there's nothing like a pastor knowing when someone's at the moment of breakthrough but they let their past hold them back they don't know that that decision that moment Demands a decision are you sufficiently impressed with the word oh little bride tonight do you know the power that you have in your hand well what do you mean what power what a time it is to actually be able to overcome to not let the root of bitterness rule our life that bitterness is a big thing in churches it's a big thing in families bitterness and we all have a right to have it we all have a right brother Joe to have bitterness because some somebody done me wrong somewhere along the way and yet Jesus said father forgive him for they know not what they're doing Stephen preached with the greatest sermon in his life as he was dying by the Stones of his haters and yet bitterness rules our life here's a great quote I like from Smith Wigglesworth and we're coming to a close for this portion is that it is an insult to ask God for power after you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to say it again it's an insult to ask God for power after you've received the baptism of the Holy Ghost why because you have power you just have to act the power of God was placed in you healing was already placed in you you remember the man that went to Brother Brandon and he said oh this brother couldn't do anything for me this brother couldn't do anything for me so I came to you he said you've done it all wrong you've come to the wrong place I can't do anything for you you've got to find Christ you say well if brother Brennan was here he'd make it all right no go to Christ well if brother Tim would have shook in my hand no go to Christ find Christ because the road demands us to act choose you today was it was it brought forth who do you say that he is can you take up your cross and follow him can you forsake all because behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice how many actually are hearing his voice without opening the door I'm not talking about you but it's a sad thing that's out there you ever just been in a crowd of people and nobody that you could see around you believe the message or knew of it you ever just been surrounded by it I'll tell you one of the biggest places to be surrounded by it is at least for me where I'm always surrounded by crowds is at the at the parks in Florida in fact I found myself there here last year and standing there in this line of people and I said oh God does anybody here where are they standing where are they where are they at what did it do it makes us humble how could God choose someone like me listen I don't deserve to be behind this Pulpit I have done things in my life that I'm ashamed of who hasn't I've spit in his face who hasn't but it's by the grace of God that he called us and he and he placed in front of me a decision I had to stand at the altar one day and I had to come to a place in my life where I didn't care I didn't care to me what my fellow friends thought it didn't care to me what anyone said I want to just surrender to God I didn't care how embarrassing it was I was willing to do what I had to do again some people don't believe in it but this is one of the things that I was going through and I remember one of the services that I was a part of and we were singing the song bloodbot Church man that's a powerful song and I'll never forget it I was like 12 13 years old and we were actually doing a church March and I had never broke free never broke loose I was too ashamed I was nervous I was always caring about what other people thought and I will never forget that that moment when God Came Upon me and in my heart he said you run how many ever felt that before you run well but but what will people say and she's singing the song bloodbot Church hey I was a part of the March man that's good enough I got out of my pew I was marching around the church with everybody I was with the crowd it's easy to do when everyone else is but when God tells you to do something that no one else is doing are you all in uh-huh and all of a sudden it left brother Tim it left me and it was like my life was over I felt like I had I was on my road to hell you say over not running around the church you're an idiot I'm telling you how I felt I felt like I had crossed the line and that song was going and it didn't mean anything to me anymore the only thing it was I said God bring the desire back to me bring the desire ask me one more time lord and I promise you because I just didn't want to do it now I wanted the same feeling I wanted the same pool how many remembers that when you said God bring the pull back I'm tired of just going to church I'm tired of just singing the same old songs bring the same pool back I begged God God bring it back bring the pull back and I'll never forget it oh and we are and right at that moment the pool came and I was gone boy I thought I was flying I literally did there there was no one around me that's the way I felt I was in the presence of God oh brother Jeremy you'd never had battle since then buddy I had him worse Satan fought he he did everything he could but one one blessing leads to another blessing one prayer leads to another prayer one one desire leads to another desire I want more of God but I asked them to put this up here tonight sister Jessica get ready I asked him to put this up tonight for one reason I'm going to ask you a question and I want you to be a hundred percent honest with yourself do you trust me I'm not asking about me you know what that signifies do you trust me bow your heads please the hand of God Jesus is reaching out to you tonight do you trust me do you trust me at this moment do you know who I am do you know the battle that you're fixing to go through the decision that you're going to have to make it's going to demand a decision tonight it's got to be more than just communion service it's got to be more than just going through a line and doing it I've seen leukemia healed coming through a communion service I've seen Holy Ghost filled people or a holy ghost fall on people coming in a communion line why because they were placed before a decision you could say well I'm not unworthy for communion tonight I shouldn't even be here well then you've got to get your life right it demands a decision what you see before you this do in remembrance of me is not just some ordinance we pass by but it's our life do you trust me do you trust me enough stand up speak my

your mercies to us aren't you glad you made your decision it made it a decision and the decisions made and there's never ever any going back amen God bless you we're going to go into the communion service as we just look to the Lord tonight and I just wanted to say God set for the children of Israel a time of Passover it would be a very very serious hour in time where death was coming through the land and they were leaving the land of Egypt going to the promised land and he said I want you to make the bread of haste that means I if you're not going to have time for 11 to be put into bread and raise the bread you're going to eat at unleavened [Music] because it's a bread of haste you're not going to mix anything in it it's going to be just a pure bread itself and it become a type of sin that you know you don't you can't mix anything with the true wheat of God and raise it up make it more platform make religion more easy no you can't do that God must start with the Passover and eat we tell them now I want you to do this yearly I want you to take a lamb without blemish and I want you to offer it it's got to be kept up so many days and examine seated as a perfect lamb and then if that lamb is accepted then you are accepted and this is what I want for you is I want to have this time of Passover will you remember when the death angel passed over your homes because remember you should have died too you were just as bad and wicked a people as each have ever thought about being and you should have been under judgment as well but the lamb took your judgment and this so there had to be a death and a dying in every home and so the lamb died in the place of the firstborn of the children of Israel you know I don't believe that Passover is just something that we should do it should have been done just once a year but I I think that in all reality God wants us to live and Passover where that leaven is out of our lives and we are eating the lamb and we are fellowshipping with Christ and we are walking with him now when it comes down to the New Testament they were they were weekly breaking the bread together and and um you know then and they because the original communion was a Passover service and and the you know some had plenty and some were poor and you know so Paul said you know I I've got to set this in order we can't be having a fellowship meal every Every Time We Gather like this but I tell you I received of the Lord what I'm to do and so he reminded us that the Lord Jesus tonight that he was betrayed that he took bread and he break it and when he had given thanks he said take eat this is my body which is broken for you and that do this in remembrance of me I want you to remember me that my body was broken for you and after the same manner then he took the cup and when he had slept he said this cup is the New Testament in my blood this New Year's office you drink it and remembered to me I want you to remember my blood was shed for you and then he then he went on to say um that as often as you eat and you drink eat this bread and drink this cup you show the Lord's death till he comes you you you are are showing of his death and that he died in your place that he that you have accepted him and his pardon and and his blood has been applied to your life and so symbolically today we're coming down where we're coming and taking of one loaf and it has been broken into many pieces because God's body today of course is no longer the man of Calvary but it's his body that's upon the Earth and we are a multi-membered body so when you take of that bread you remember you look at it and you remember I am a part of the body of Christ it matters how that I behave it matters how that I represent the rest of the body and my behavior and my actions when I'm away from others I want to remember I got to discern we are not playing Church but I'm Discerning the Lord's body now Paul would say many are sick and weakly among you because they did not discern that this was not playing church this is not just a common assembly but this is that we that this was the Lord's body and we discerned that we were a part of it and our Behavior demanded the respect that is shown to be in this part of his body again we would take of the fruit of the vine the life of the grapes squeezed out there and the the the and then the fermentation the spirit within it and then it would come as the wine to drink of the cup and that cup was to represent the life of God that was poured out which is the Holy Spirit and you are to be reminded that as you drink it and it burns down on the inside of you that the holy spirit is a burning fire and that there as we just take a just that portion of it in the natural but in the spiritual the Bible said you know made it clear we're not to be drunk on the line but to be filled with the spirit which means that we are to be so even though we don't get drunk on the wine or we don't over indulge on the wine but we start to overindulge in the spirit be filled with the spirit so again we are to remember we are the body of Christ we're part of the loaf each one of us had us apart there without you we're not complete and so together we make up the loaf and then we take of his life within us and so he he told us that we must realize that we're not playing church this is where we come to take the the bread the unleavened bread of sincerity and Truth so wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord but then he said let a man examine himself and then so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for heated that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drink a damnation himself not Discerning the Lord's body and he said this is why some are dead some are sleeping he said this is why many are sick and weekly because if we would have judged ourselves we would not come under the Judgment of God so you see as a very serious moment because he said when we're judged we're chasing of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world this is a wonderful thing because even in the chastening where that when he judges us for what we do and he chases and he corrects us it identifies us as his sons and his daughters amen we are chastened of the Lord because we're not going to be condemned with the world amen so we thank the Lord for this Grace Upon Our Lives and I'll tell you what in this moment I'm just going to have you be seated we're going to prepare the communion tables so the brothers that will be helping me to if they will come down and I'm going to just explain something to you though those of you that has not been here in a communion footwashing service so that you'll know what we are how we are going to conduct a service here tonight and I pray that you know for one thing that you you will excuse those who will be on the platform musicians and their families if they come up ahead and and move ahead first but the deacons will be us from you row by row and then we have two places for foot wash and the men will be on this side where we have it set up in the hallway over here the women on this side we ask that you will be respectful of that the women here the men here if you're elderly or otherwise unable to get on your knees to wash feet just return to your seat be in prayer while we return to conclude the service but what will happen is that the deacons will Usher you down um the rose and you'll go out this door men to the right women to the left those who are not going to be washing feet they will just go back to their seat and be in prayer until we conclude the service and some of our young children are young enough are old enough rather to remain in the sanctuary while the parents go out and I want to encourage you fathers to to take a youngster with you if you can for so your mother the mothers won't have to deal with so many but whatever be reverent be just respectful only praying no visiting or talking only when necessary this is a very this is all a part of a very important service now we know that Jesus comes down to the the Passover and after the Passover after the supper and the communion where he passes the bread and the wine then he he girds itself with a towel and takes a basin and pours water into it and he goes to wash the different disciples feet and as he does he comes to Peter and Peter says but you'll not wash my feet and and he said Peter if I don't wash your feet you have no part with me and he and of course Peter being all the way kind of presumptuous like he always was you know he said well then Lord you know I I then do my head my hands and my feet just you know just watched me all over and he said no he said he that has been washed he that's been bathed and those days he had bath houses and they they would take their bath and ceremonial baths and so on the uniform services like this but when they walked the path to get to the upper room where they were going that was secured for the Passover there they would have to walk down the trail of where the animals and people men had walked and all kinds of things and they picked up the dirt along the road and this is a thing that happens with us as a Christian when we have been lost he has lost us our minds are hands we've washed us made us clean but you know when we walk in the path of life when we go out into the world and we walk into the path where others have gone you know we pick up contamination along the way we remember that this is the part with foot washing foot washing is to remember that we as saints of God are to encourage one another washing the dirt from one another's feet and encouraging them helping them along the path of life in life's journey you've been washed the Holy Spirit has filled you but we come for this service tonight in a foot washing and it's again ceremonial it's an ordinance that we are to fulfill water baptism is one of them communion is another what and then the foot washing is the other and it is to remind us why we are here that we are not here to be served but we are here to serve it is to remind us that nobody is big and nobody's little Among Us we're all one part of this body and we wash one another's feet that true Christianity comes with humility with surrenders of our life to serve God now I want you to Bow your heads with me father as we come before your throne of grace today we have spoken of these wonderful things that are written in your word and we've heard a marvelous message and our hearts was moved and Lord I want to thank you for each heart that you moved upon and I believe Lord that there's been some very Eternal things that have happened even in this service today Lord I believe that even in this moment that we've purged our hearts we've looked at even the parasites that we want to hang on or some kind of fungi that has to be cut out by the Holy Spirit Lord there's something that we can't take in the Rapture something that that we that would keep us Earth bound and Lord today you have by the holy spirit so graciously circumcised and cleansed and cut away the flesh as it were and Lord made us presentable unto you now father we hold behold before us the bread and the wine representing symbolizing the bread symbolizing your body the the wine the blood of Jesus Christ as we take of it maybe remember what you did for us at Calvary in Jesus name amen have the deacons to come as we prepare the tables for the communion we're just going to put on some soft music this is where that our musicians can participate in this you just come humbly sweetly before the Lord remembering remembering he died he gave his life for you consecrating yourself remembering you are here for service foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign thank you thank you foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign
