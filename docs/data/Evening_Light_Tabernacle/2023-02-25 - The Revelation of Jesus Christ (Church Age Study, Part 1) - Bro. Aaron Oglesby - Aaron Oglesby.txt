service in the name of Jesus we pray amen amen you can have your seats for just just one moment as we get started here I pray that you'll just be patient with me tonight as um I do this I've never done anything quite like this as far as taking and trying to put visuals and things up there just for the uh for the sake of y'all being able to follow along and um yeah um how many and this ain't gonna call anybody out but how many by the raising of hand can say I read chapter one in the church age book okay that's a lot of hands so I'm not going to look at the ones that didn't if you didn't please catch up because uh my heart's desire as we go through these services at the end of it is that you have read the church age book for yourself that is my heart's desire because because I know that there are so many things in that book that that we believe and it's not that we just believe them because brother Brown was a prophet although that's the truth but it's things that are in the Bible and maybe you've been told your whole life we believe this we believe this we believe this and what the church age book can help do for you is place that in the word and help you have an understanding of oh it's not just because mama said or it's not just because daddy said or or just because this is what we believe but it is in the Bible it is the word of God and and that's that's our desire is that you would read the church age book and hopefully by coming to the meetings and we can have the opportunity to maybe break it down just a little bit what we have read and and and maybe bring it kind of like a Sunday school lesson but we also just want to ask the Lord that he would come in an anoint to where it wouldn't necessarily just be something dry of me teaching or going over slides but that you can be be touched in his presence that that is our desire as we go through this our our main theme really is just is a study of the seven Church ages just like brother Brown said but but in this we're going to discuss a lot of major doctrines that we believe from the Bible and like I said I Believe by the grace of God it will help each and every one of us grow in our faith to see the things that we believe lying right there in the word and um your brother Branham says that that the the church Ages come forth with a mighty initial illumination without which there could be no further light he says for out of the ages comes the seals and out of the seals come the trumpets and out of the trumpets come the vowels like the first burst of a Roman Candle the church ate just come forth with a mighty initial illumination without which there could be no further light so so if he he makes a statement of that much importance about an understanding of the ages I believe it's something that we should take heed to if he says that there can be no further light without this then it's something that we should look into and do our best to have an understanding and one thing that we're going to find as we go into this is that it can't just be our best and what we think brother Branham makes it clear that you know even just regular study won't reveal these things to you but it takes a revelation so so my prayer for each of us is that as we go through this that we will all have greater Revelation than when we began he says but once the Brilliance of the seven Church ages is given by divine revelation light upon light follows until the whole of the Revelation opens wide before our wandering eyes so as we go into this I believe that we should all strive to understand all the truths of God many times as young people some of those things seem Out Of Reach you know some of those things brother Tim has talked to me and he says you know he says I I I'm concerned because I don't want to preach things that are just flying right over the heads of the young people you know and he says sometimes I I say things and I see the young people just like you know and he says and so his desire our desire is that we should strive for all of it and if there's things that we can't quite grasp that we we don't just lay it aside and forget about it but we pray that the Lord will open our eyes to those things and help us have an understanding of those things and and it is my desire that his brother Branham says here as we go through this that light upon light will be shed into our lives as we study the church ages so we had you to read chapter one which was entitled The revelation of Jesus the Christ and and if you have your Bibles with you we're gonna turn to Revelation 1 1 through 3. I feel kind of like brother uh Matt Watkins who showed up last week and came to preach for us and didn't bring his Bible and so he had the bar brother Tim's and then I walked out here and set my computer down and went I didn't bring my Bible but I've got the verses right here we're going to read Revelation 1 1-3 if you'll stand with me as we read these three verses says the revelation of Jesus of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth you've already been blessed tonight blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand amen you may have your seats for the time is at hand I believe this is something that we should take very seriously as we look around the world around us and recognize young people the time is at hand the things that that I've heard preach my whole life the things that you've heard preach it's not something that's that's a long way off even if if you follow any news whatsoever and I know as a young person many times we don't because news is for old people or whatever but but even as in the news daily now I'm seeing headlines about World War III I in the last two weeks every single day I'm seeing headlines is this the start of World War III are we being led right into World War III just time after time and I don't say those things to scare you as I've said before as Believers we shouldn't get scared when the things that we've believed for our whole life start to appear in front of us it shouldn't Shake us but it shouldn't be something in us that makes us want to dig a little deeper and and make our calling in election sure and say Lord thank you that you allow me to see these signs thank you that you allow me to recognize it and that it doesn't shake me in the way of fear but it lets me know it's time to look up because our Redemption draweth nigh amen so we read Revelation one through three and that's where this begins and and brother Branham tells us that the Scribe of this book is Saint John the Divine and he says he's not the author but he is the Scribe it is the only book in the entire Bible that is written by Jesus himself through personally appearing to a scribe and and we know that this book is written while John is exiled out on the Isle of Patmos and it is a Greek island where many Christians were were sent for their stand and their stand for for Christianity and for Jesus and I want to tell you today you know many times that we we feel like we have a lot of persecution or what do our friends say and how will people look at us in Walmart if we're holding the standard of Christianity and I'm telling you that we actually have a light burden to bear can compared to what they buried in days gone by because I can guarantee you no matter how many people may Snicker and laugh at you as you walk through Target they're not going to take you and put you in a den of lines okay you're not going to have to pick up swords and and be gladiators by the end of the week you've got it okay okay so we want to be thankful that what happened to John is because of his stand he was put out on the on the Isle of patents by the Roman Emperor domitian is how I pronounce it that's probably wrong I don't speak Latin but but the it says d-o-m-i-t-i-a-n it may be domidian I'm not sure but either way he's placed there and many times what we have to recognize is in in things that we that the devil means for evil God is going to turn and use that situation in your life for good out of this Exile out of being placed out there with the Scorpions and spiders on this Rocky Little Island which is one of the worst things that could have happened to him it probably was intended to bring his death about out of that comes the Book of Revelation an opportunity for God to draw close and to appear to him and speak to him when the devil does things to you don't let that be an opportunity for him to keep you away from God don't let that be an opportunity for him to get you completely separated but when he does his worse to you always recognize it that is an opportunity for you to draw closer to God than ever before it is an opportunity for you to lean into the bosom of God and to draw strength like you never have before it's actually quite typical of humans when things are good not to lean on God when things are good to lean on their own understanding or to lean On Their Blessings as it were And yet when the Devil comes and tightens the screws down many times times that's when we can draw closer to God than ever before and I pray that we don't always just wait till it's the hard times don't just wait till you're on the Isle of patents but tonight take the opportunity and say Lord I want to draw closer to you tonight than I ever have before brother Brown would describe um would describe the Book of Revelation using this same analogy because the Greek word for Revelation is apocalypse which means the unveiling and he would say it's like a sculptor who has a sculpture hidden under a blanket and then he removes it to show it to his audience this is the unveiling The Book of Revelation is the unveiling or the revelation of Jesus Christ how many tonight would like him to be unveiled before your eyes say Lord I've seen bits and pieces I've seen a little bit I I've understood some Lord but tonight Lord what I want is a complete unveiling and as we read this it's not just the unveiling or the uncovering of the person of Christ although that's exactly what it is but it is also the revelation of his Future Works down through the the coming ages and and it's full of Prophecy and it's full of symbols and because of that that's why most the people in the world that probe into this book are a million miles off because that they've not seen it Through The Eyes of a prophet and we have to admit ourselves that if it wasn't for Malachi 4 if it wasn't for Revelation 10 7 we would be in the exact same place that they are it's not for us to get lifted up and oh look at us we understand things but it's the mercy and Grace of almighty God that he sent a prophet in this day and not only did he send them Prophet but he allowed you to recognize that there was a prophet he allowed you to accept it as truth and because of that you see what the truth is because of that you can see it being unveiled and the sculptor pulling it off as we look at this book then we look at it as the revelation of his Future Works in the oncoming Seven Ages and many people look at that and there's no recognition of these churches being a period of time they just literally see them as churches but brother Branham tells us as we read this ordinary study is not going to open it up to you it takes a prophetic class of people with spiritual Revelation to get it and tonight I'd like to tell you that's you that's who you are you are a prophetic class of people because a prophet has come in this day to you and has begun to reveal these things and you as a people are able to sit there and say I believe that I receive that and because you sit underneath the prophet's message that makes you a prophetic class of people and it took a prophet coming in this day to unlock the Mysteries held down Through the Ages one of the major points of Revel of this first book that we had chaptered the revelation of Jesus Christ it deals with the importance of Revelation in your life and I have to admit even as I began to read this it struck me stronger than it ever had before how important Revelation is we've heard it said before but as you read through it the entire thing our entire experience our walk it's all based and rooted and the entire church is built upon Revelation brother Branham says the importance of Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be over emphasized well what's that mean that means we can say at every service we can say it every day we can talk about it amongst our friends and you can never over emphasize the importance of spiritual Revelation to a believer and he says not the book but spiritual Revelation that comes to the belief that comes to the individual and then brother Branham immediately goes into Matthew 16. and Matthew 16 is a place that you're all very familiar with it is a place of personal testimony Matthew 16 is a place of personal testimony and he says and he said unto them but whom say ye that I am now every last one of us in this building at some point in our life have to come to this spot right here I want you to think about it you all have to come to this place that it doesn't matter what your friends say it doesn't matter what Mom and Dad say it doesn't even matter what brother Tim or brother Joe or brother Aaron says this isn't brother Aaron's Revelation but the spirit is coming to you tonight and he's asking you tonight who do you say that I am what is your testimony and it's bringing it down because when he first asked it there well this one says this and this one says this well well brother Joe says this and brother Tim preaches this and brother Aaron and my mom and dad say we believe this and the spirit say no no that's not what we're talking about tonight we're bringing this to a place of personal testimony who do you say that I am and he responds and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven now notice Flesh and Blood didn't do this mom and dad didn't give this to you I want you to understand that as as mom and dads we would love to give it to you it was the greatest desire of our heart that we want to see you get this Revelation that he is my savior that he is my God he is my Lord he is my we want you to have that so bad but I just can't give it to you now it's my job to teach you it's my job to talk to you about it as a dad and as parents that's our job to do but at the end of the day we can't give you that revelation we can't give you that personal experience but there is one who not only can but he wants to give it to you tonight he wants to reveal himself to you he wants to be your savior he wants to fill you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost he says but teachers didn't give this to you Seminary didn't give it to you your parents didn't give it to you but my Father which is in heaven he has given it to you and then he goes on and says and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church in the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it I want you to notice something here many times we jump there and talk about the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail and we'll get to that but in recognizing who Jesus is in having a real revelation of who Jesus is that's when you find out who you really are so many times people are searching who am I and I just want to know who I am and I just want to know where I fit in I just want a place to be I want people to love me and I'm telling you if you want to find yourself tonight find yourself in Jesus when you recognize He's Mine He's called me I'm called to be his I'm part of the Bride Jesus Is My Savior that's when you'll find out who you really are that's where you'll find out where you really fit in you may not fit in with this group or that group or this one or that one but you will always have a place in Jesus and nothing else really matters tonight I'm telling you put everything you got into finding him put everything you got into getting that Revelation where you can look at him and say thou art the Christ you're not just daddies but you're mine you're not just mamas but you're mine get to that place and you'll really find out who you really are it's in his recognition of that that he says Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against him so we see right here that the church is built on Revelation and now let's bring it down Beyond everybody your victories will be built on Revelation your walk will be built on Revelation revelation of who he is revelation of who you are and a revelation of what he's done for you when it has to go beyond teaching because good teaching is just that it's good okay but there there is a human element to that that someone could come along with a better argument they can come along and twist things but whenever you get a revelation of who he is and who you are and what he did for you then the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against that nobody can ever take a spiritual Revelation away from you brother Branham tells us here he says it isn't as the Protestants say that the church is built upon Jesus it was the revelation he says read it the way it's written Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it but my father hath revealed it and Upon This Rock Revelation I will build my church the church is built on Revelation on thus saith the Lord amen revelation brother Brown tells us that Satan hates the Book of Genesis and he hates the Book of Revelation the most now if we get right down to it I'm sure Satan hates all the word of God he hates everything there is about God but brother Branham comes in here and he tells us why these two books he says because he hates to be exposed and he says what these books do is they tell them his true origin they tell of his awful ways and then they tell of his destruction he says Revelation exposes him and his attacks brother Branham goes and he talks about when he's talking about how the devil hates to be exposed and he begins talking about he says I wish you could be with me in the discernment lines he says when when the the faces of the people and he makes it very clear he says I'm not talking about those people he said but the faces the look that comes across their face um during the discernment when the devil knows it's over when the devil knows he's about to be exposed I wish tonight that we could get a good look at his face because I believe with all my heart that there's a group of young people maybe he's tried to hold you down for a long time maybe he's tried to keep you bound and keeping you from coming to the revelation of who you are but tonight he is recognizing that he is about to be exposed he's lied to some of y'all long enough he's kept you from your privileges for some of you long enough but if you could ever just get that Revelation ain't that right sister Lauren if you ever recognize I'm gonna be there then there's nothing that the devil can do there's nothing he can say no doubt no lie no unbelief can come that will keep you from being there once you get that that I'm telling you he's going to lose his grip on your life and he recognizes he's about to be exposed and he hates that tonight Hallelujah he says Revelation exposes him and his attacks so he tries to minimize Revelation and destroy your confidence in the word destroy your confidence in the word whether that be by destroying your confidence in the ministry or whether that be by destroying your confidence because someone can come and say well this didn't exactly happen just like this or or this whatever he does he comes and tries to get you to second guess he comes and he tries to get you to begin to doubt but listen what brother Branham says when the church disbelieves Satan and believes the spirit's revelation of the word the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against her I think it's time for some of you here tonight to start disbelieving Satan and start believing what it is the spirit's been trying to tell you service after service after service you're not worthless you're not gonna fail you're not a sinner you're not bound for hell but you're a Son of God you're a daughter of God you're love the king of kings came he died for you he's calling you tonight it's the spirit speaking expressly to you tonight saying cast down the LIE of the enemy disbelieve Satan believe the spirit what's the spirit saying you are mine tonight he's calling out to you tonight and he's saying cast down that lie and when you begin to do that those chains begin to break off your life but as long as you believe this and you believe well my family's no good and and this and that and your eyes get on all those things you begin to have your confidence in the word destroyed listen it ain't about your family it ain't about me it ain't about brother Joe it ain't about brother Tim it's about what Jesus Christ did for you let's bring it back to that when you get a revelation of who he is in a revelation of who you are and what he did for you then the rest of it doesn't matter oh but Mama this and Daddy got his feelings hurt and this one that and that I said it's about you and it's about Jesus and when you get it back to that the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against you Hallelujah too many times we're walking around speaking the devil's language well I'm just a sinner I'm just a failure I'm just a Judas now the spirit says you're the purchase of My Blood listen don't take and minimize the power of the sacrifice by elevating the power of your flaws you just don't know this family curse you just don't know how often I've fallen to the same thing you just don't know I can never be saved I could never be delivered and what you do when you say those things is you actually minimize the effect of the atonement I'm telling you it's powerful enough tonight I'm telling you it's strong enough tonight I'm telling you it will overcome and defeat any hindering Spirit that's trying to keep you from the end goal and the end goal is a body change and a Rapture and the spirit's telling you tonight it's for you you're gonna make it how does he know he's going to make it because he paid the price for you he knows whose names on the Lamb's Book of Life he knows who you are and tonight he's trying to tell you who you are the devil's going it ain't you it ain't for you it ain't for you I'm telling you it is for you it was for you it's still for you he's still pleading the blood for you even now Hallelujah revelation I love this brother Mike if you're anywhere that can hear me and you could get me some water that'd be awesome brother Brown says let me show you another reason why Satan hates this book of the revelation the revelation of Jesus Christ in the church he knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he changes not he knows he knows that a whole lot more than do 90 percent of the theologians he knows that since God is immutable in his nature then he is just as immutable in his ways thus Satan knows assuredly that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own now that strikes me that almost knocks the socks off of me when brother Branham says Satan knows look we got a lot of people in our own ranks that we can't get to know this and Satan's a million miles ahead of him Satan knows that since God is immutable then he is just as immutable in his ways he knows us surely that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own all else is false it has to be listen young people as you begin to grow and and and in some ways you are already the the centerpiece of even like Tabernacle in some ways you're already the crown jewel I notice when y'all go to a youth camp and all and this right here is missing you don't even want to be in those song service I'm just saying old people man I know that's me too now but y'all are an incredible at you're more than an asset you you're this you're the future uh pillars of the church and one thing that the devil is going to try to do thank you so much it don't matter I appreciate it not too oh is that a cold versus warm I thought you was asking what brand water I like better perfect thank you as time goes on he more and more and more is going to try to talk you out of the power of a living God and he's going to try to bring you into that formalism because that's his attack that is his attack but brother Brown says now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts he says it exposes Satan's attempts to make the church lukewarm formal and Powerless why is Satan so against us preaching that that we're going back to the book of Acts and that we're a repeat and and that we're repeating or a continuation I should say of the book of Acts why is he against that because if you'll go back and see how he was treated in those books if you'll go back and look at what Mark 16 says you're going to do if you'll go back and see how he was cast out in the book of Acts then you recognize he doesn't want a church walking around operating in that power of course he wants you to believe you can't cast him out of course he wants you to believe that Mark 16 17 says and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them for they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so he's telling you that's not you that's not who you are that's not what you're going to be of course he tells you that because when you're that then Satan is cast out when you're that then the sick are healed when you're that people are filled with the Holy Ghost so he comes and he says that's not you that's not you that's not you but we want her to tell him tonight you're too late Revelation has already struck our heart and when we read that we say that's me I can cast out the devil I can face deadly things I can overcome anything that comes my way because that's who I am and he hates it because it exposes who he is Hallelujah he says he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army well of course he tells you don't preach this he tells you don't believe this of course he says it's for another day what does he want with facing an invincible Army Invincible means you can't be beat he has to keep you from getting that true Revelation because if my equation is right if you get that Revelation you're never going to lose once you get that Revelation he's never going to win so he fights it and brother Brown says yes Satan hates Revelation but there is a people on the Earth that can say but we love it we say Lord pour it out I need more Revelation brother Brown says you asked for Revelation you pray for revelation we love revelation the Revelation that you are that church called to do the Greater Works the Revelation that you are that church that isn't just here trying to learn but has an ear that can hear what the spirit says call to understand called to receive a message called to take a rapture it is the revelation that defeats the enemy brother Brandon would say it is the revelation of God that will give you authority over the devil so of course he fights revelation he hates Revelation and he tries to do away with the supernatural aspect and make it something that you just learned just learn this just just read this and say but no when you read something say Lord reveal this to me May It Go deeper than a head knowledge but Lord May something take anchor on the inside of me that I know beyond any shadow of a doubt that you put there that this is truth open your word to to me Lord Revelations 1 4-6 it says John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which is which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness I love the descriptions of Jesus here the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins and his own blood and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen this starts off in verse 4 saying John to the seven churches which are in Asia now when they say Asia what they literally are referring to is what was known as Asia Minor I know you probably can't see all the the small writing there but I just wanted you to to be able to place this in your mind when we talk about these churches where they're at so if you look on the far left you see Italy a little bit more to the east you see Greece and you come a little bit further that big Peninsula this ain't going to show up on there it don't show up on the screen but you see Asia Minor there in the Box it's that large Peninsula right there if you come South you'll see Jerusalem so that area the peninsula specifically over by the the ocean on the west side of that Peninsula is where you find the seven churches of Asia Minor if you look at it it was roughly 290 000 square miles that probably means nothing to you so just so you can place it a little bit that's about the size of Texas Asia Minor would be about the same size as Texas now we're going to zoom in just for a moment so that you can see this a little closer and this is Asia Minor and you see the church as their Ephesus Smyrna pergamon thytera Sardis Philadelphia and laodicea why are these the only churches mentioned surely in an area the size of Texas there were more than seven churches more than that that had sprung up surely there were more than just those and why doesn't it mention Antioch or Earth thessalonica why specifically these seven and what we'll find as we go through the church age book and study is that these cities were specifically picked for their unique characteristics these character the characteristics of these seven churches are exactly the same characteristics that each of the seven Church Ages were going to have down through history so in other words these churches Ephesus Smyrna pergaman thotara Sardis Philadelphia laodicea represent periods of time when we read about them in the Book of Revelation so as we go we're going to see that each of these seven churches represent an age that was to come and each age is going to have a messenger that will speak God's word for that day and now sometimes people will say well isn't God's word always the same what do you mean by God's word for that day and the the most the easiest way to explain this is Moses had a message for his day God's word is always God's word but it was the message needed in that moment for that time Noah had a message for his day God's word never changes but that was the word the portion that was needed in that day to make sure that they escaped and so in each age there would be another portion that was revealed and there would be a messenger that would come in that time for that age and so as we go into this one of the things we're going to focus on for the next few minutes because this is what brother Brown really focuses on in chapter one is the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ now I'm not brother Tim I can't break down the godhead quite like he can or even close but we're just going to try to get us all to the same place that we have no question that God is one that there aren't three Gods now I know you all believe that but we want it to be a revelation we want something to Anchor deep down to where it can't be talked out of us So speaking of revelation we must have the revelation of the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ brother Branham says the greatest of all Revelations is the deity the Supreme deity of our Lord Jesus Christ so take a minute and let's put some things together he says you can never emphasize Revelation too much and then he says the greatest Revelation is the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ put those two things together and I would say it is very important that we seek for the proper Revelation not just on paper not just what Mom and Dad believe but within ourselves of the Supreme deity of the Lord Jesus Christ because brother Branham goes on to say you can't get to first base until you believe that you can't even get started in your Christian walk until you believe in the Supreme deity of the Lord Jesus Christ brother Brown says it's a mighty Revelation and what we see here is is the Revelation that the very first church age had God is one the the Lord Jesus as we read as you read through you will find that he has many titles that are attributed to him to show his greatness there in this passage we just read he's Alpha and Omega first born from among the dead Prince of the kings of the Earth the almighty and people recognize these as titles but then when they see father son Holy Ghost all of a sudden it's oh wait wait there's three of him well all these other titles we attribute to one we don't say well the alpha omega is one distinct person and the firstborn's a distinct person and then the prince no they're just titles that would describe him and that's what we find with Father Son and Holy Ghost but many people today believe that there are three Gods instead of one now they will they'll talk to you and they'll say no no we believe in one God but they believe in three distinct persons in one God and brother Branham would even make the statement he says not only is there no Bible for it he says there's not even good reasoning there he said there's not even Common Sense there so so it isn't that there's three Gods but there's one God tonight with three offices or three titles father son and Holy Ghost what we find is there is a great error what we would call the error of the Trinity and I'm going to read these two excerpts here brother Brown will put them in the church age book he says they came from a Christian magazine if you do a little bit of research you will find that this is pretty standard as far as what most of your nominal churches will believe this is their belief yet the New Testament with equal clearness teaches that the father is God and the son is God and the Holy Spirit is God and that these three are not three aspects of the same person uh oh but three persons standing in a truly personal relationship to one another if you've ever wondered what do trinitarians believe here you go they also State God according to the Bible is not just one person but he is three persons in one God that is the great mystery of the Trinity and brother Branham says it sure is he talks about how a woman comes to him and says but brother Branham aren't you and your wife one and he says yes but not like that he says do you see me right now she says yeah he says do you see my wife no but when you saw Jesus he said if you've seen me you've seen the father if you've seen me you've seen the father Revelation 1 8 says I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending saith the Lord which is which was which is to come the almighty who is Jesus he's deity he is the almighty he's not just a a person of the Trinity he's not just a person he is the person he is almighty God so how did it get so messed up how did it get so messed up from from there at the beginning where they had this truth men we have a supreme talent for messing things up it amazes me even in the Simplicity of Church going ons or or a meeting or this how things can be announced run thrown a screen talked about for weeks and then people get it wrong Oh I thought it was I thought it was at seven well that's no big deal just human error exactly so now imagine getting Bunches of theologians together and this idea and that idea and we're not talking about simple things the Bible talks about what a great mystery these things are and you start getting well I think this and I think that and the next thing you know it's all scrupled up it's all messed up and then when they get things messed up they get together and they try to fix it and in so doing they come to an agreement and they get all their mess-ups and all my mess ups and we agree on some of the mess ups and go okay that's the truth for now on so what they do is they agree to to agree on something and yet it's not the truth always keep that in mind just because people agree with you doesn't mean you're right I don't know where that's coming from but let's just talk about that just because you get people around you that see it your way doesn't make it right I would like to remind you that there was a lot of angels that agreed with Lucifer they weren't right you stand on your convictions of what the word says the word is what's right the word is truth not what your friend says not what they think is okay the word is where truth is at not seeing counsel 325 A.D in the beginning brother Brown says they didn't believe in three gods in the beginning of the church so they all come together in modern day Turkey which was in Asia Minor then I see in Council and it was a great Council was held to address certain doctrinal debates that had risen up in the church and if you study it all and pay attention and all that's how the spirit of denomination works it's always done to protect truth well this is true so we need to protect it this is true so we need to protect it and they come together and they establish what truth is and they and they try to protect it and here at this meeting they form the dogmas of Catholicism that eventually was handed down into the Protestant churches this is where the Trinity comes into play that we hear about today the trinitarian doctrine begins at the Nicene Council and it becomes a foundational Doctrine here in 325 and the reason it happened was you had Constantine who was a Roman Emperor who had accepted Christianity and yet it wasn't something that was um being easily accepted amongst the Romans because the Romans were polytheists which means they had many gods they worshiped Venus and Mars and Jupiter just just a few of the many maybe even hundreds I'm not sure how many they have but it was a lot and now all of a sudden you have this which is which they see is just one God and they and they couldn't make it work they were used to praying to their dead ancestors and they saw a certain truth to this and so what they did was they took certain truth and they hybridized it what you see here is even a type of what happened there in the garden where truth was mixed with a lie and when truth is mixed with a lie what is there always the end result death and so they began to mix truth with a lie and they're used to praying to their ancestors so you can see how easy it was for them to to blend their Pagan religion right over into Christianity they split God into three and they continued to pray to the dead now it wasn't too necessarily their ancestors but they made Saints of those that had died and and they would pray to Peter and they would pray to Paul and pray to Christopher and all the different ones and and starting right there the revelation of one God operated in three offices began to be lost and the Creed of three persons in one God began to be accepted right there during that time and so we're going to take a second and look at some biblical truth Matthew 1 18. it says now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of God the Father it's not what it says found with child of the I'm gonna make y'all wake up all together Holy Ghost all found with child of the Holy Ghost so we see right here that God the father as some would express it and God the Holy Spirit have to be the same or else we have Jesus with two fathers everyone no no no the father is his father well that says the Holy Ghost was his father now you're going to have to explain that and you're probably going to get down into things you don't want to talk about how is this possible because God the father as some would Express and the Holy Ghost are one in the same they are the same there is but one God because Jesus himself brother Brandon would say but Jesus himself claimed that God was his father so which is it you have to make the two go together they have to be the same we have to come to the conclusion there is but one God amen how many believes that he says the god that tabernacled above the tents of Israel now took on himself a tent of Flesh and tabernacled as a man amongst men but he was the same God we're going to bring this down to a point as we begin to the downhill part of this as it were and I want us to get focused on that Jesus was God not part of God not a peace of God not one-third of God he was God he says the Bible teaches that God was in Christ the body was Jesus in him dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily brother Branham says he was Christ but he was given a name down here among men that outward Tabernacle men could see was called Jesus he was The Lord Of Glory the almighty manifested in flesh he is God the Father Son and Holy Ghost he is all of that God manifested In the Flesh First Timothy 3 16 says and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifested in the flesh justified in the spirit scene of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world and received up into Glory who was God the son God the Father God God was he says there is one God and that one God was manifest In the Flesh and named Jesus he's the all-in-all he's the Alpha and the Omega he's the Creator he's the savior of your soul he's the one Knocking at Your Heart tonight he's the one telling you that I am God and I'm big enough for your problem I am God I can deal with that depression I am God I can turn your life around there's no sin too big there's no there's no mountain I won't climb up I am God what happens is people get confused by titles these are just titles let them you'll stand up are you a brother you are are you a son are you a cousin your nephew you can have your seat I only saw one person and I saw a son I saw a nephew I saw a brother those are titles or offices that he holds but he's just Lemuel he is not a trinity of limules he's just living and yet he is those things Jesus is the Father the Son the Holy Ghost brother Brown says he is all of that these are just titles like our righteousness Rose of Sharon our peace Father Son and Holy Ghost but none of these are his name they are offices or we would say roles he came in the flesh as son to die he came in the flesh To Be Our Redeemer he came back in the form of the Holy Ghost who you keep saying he he came he created he died he went to hell he rose again he ascended he came back in the form of the Holy Ghost Jesus he is all of that the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ brother Branham says the most important of Revelations he says you can't get to first base without that revelation brother Brown would tell us don't be confused because he has three offices or that he has a three-fold manifestation he that was Jesus the prophet he that is the high priest making intercession for you right now and he which is to come the soon coming King on Earth he was a lamb he was a prophet and he was a son but he was Jesus he was all three of those things and yet he that didn't make him three they were manifestations of one person Jesus was the lamb he was a prophet like unto Moses and he was the son of God he was the sacrifice he is your Redeemer he is our all in all that is descriptions of the one and only Lord Jesus Christ you say You're really belaboring this point absolutely brother Branham says it is the greatest of all Revelations we could never emphasize it enough he is all of that brother Branham says I love this right here Revelation 15 and 3. it says and they sing the song of Moses the servant of God pay close attention to this the servant of God and the song of the Lamb we're talking about the lamb now somebody give me the human name of the Lamb it's okay we're in church say it loud uh one more time Jesus that's the lamb we know that right so we're talking about the the serve the song of the lamb and what does the song of Jesus the lamb say great and marvelous are thy Works Lord God Almighty just and true are thy ways Thou King of saints the lamb once slain the high priest who is it the Lord God Almighty as plain as day right there in the word who is Jesus the Lord God Almighty and where do we see him at his current office is lamb the offices change young people his current office is lamb there is the high priest holding his blood on The Mercy Seat is the Lord God Almighty who is it pleading for you the Lord God Almighty who is it that died for you the Lord God Almighty who is it beckoning to your soul tonight just come a little bit closer surrender yourself to me it's the Lord God Almighty and why is it that it's so important why now what's the hurry wise because at some point that's going to change and the lamb becomes the lion of the tribe of Judah and when he takes on that role then there's no more intercessor on The Mercy Seat and what he's saying to you tonight is while he is the Lamb while he's pleading the blood he's telling you tonight accept me in this role accept me as your sacrifice accept me as intercessor except the blood tonight settle the question tonight settle this question that is who do you say that I am who am I to you tonight what is my role in your life tonight what is our relationship tonight because it won't always be Islam you say well isn't he King now yes but not King of the Earth he's the king of saints he's the coming King of the Earth but right now he is the king of saints because brother Branham would teach us here in this first chapter that his kingdom right now is not an Earthly Kingdom but it is a spiritual Kingdom in other words young people we're not from here that's why we act different talk different dress different feed different listen if you're eating out the cattle trough if you're a cow if you're eating with the pigs in the pig slop you're a Pig why do you say that brother Aaron you can't claim to be one thing but feeding on other things you're going to feed on look what's the oldest saying people said like in in third grade you are what you well let me tell you the devil's children feed on Non-Stop Hollywood the devil's children feed on the movie stars the devil's children feed on the slop of the world I'm not calling anybody anything I've already told you what the spirit's telling you you are your sons and daughters of God I'm asking you what are you eating because if you're part of that Kingdom and you've allowed him voluntarily to come and be your king then it'll change the way you act it'll change the way you talk it'll change the way you treat others it'll change the way you dress it'll change the things it'll change your appetite I'll never forget brother Joe during that the Holy Ghost series that he preached there a few years back and he just hammered that over and over and over again that when you get the Holy Ghost your desires will change it's not anymore oh I want those things but I just can't have them no that's you keeping a law but when the Holy Ghost comes on the inside of you and you allow him to be your king then it changes those desires you no longer want to feed with the pigs you don't want to do those things but see it's coming a time where every Kingdom of this world is going to be torn down and destroyed you don't want to find yourself in that Kingdom you want to be in his kingdom now because he's going to be king whether it's by takeover or whether it's because you chose to serve him because when he comes back every other Kingdom will be torn down but tonight he's offering you a position and a place in his kingdom he offers you power over the kingdoms of the world he's telling you tonight you can be filled with Jesus you can be filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost not a third person of the Trinity you can be filled with the person you can lay it all down tonight you know where your struggles oh well brother Aaron this ain't really Evangelistic that doesn't matter a bit we're talking about the word of God and the word of God says the promise is unto you and to your children and to as many as the Lord God shall call even them that are far off so I don't care where you're at tonight in your relationship with God you may be millions of miles away you may be so far away but tonight the spirit of God is calling you and saying you can be in this Kingdom you don't have to serve the devil anymore you don't have to be here when that Kingdom's torn down but you can be in the Kingdom of the king of kings the king of saints and he's calling you tonight to your position within that Kingdom amen revelation of Jesus Christ continued John 14 16. he says I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you and what he's saying here is he said that he would pray to the father within another comforter who was with them already so who was with them who was with the disciples we can say it again it's his house Jesus it's Jesus he says but ye know him for he dwelleth with you in other words I'm with you right now I'm talking about me he's what are you saying but I'm going to be in you the same one that's dwelling with you is going to be the one that is in you he says and I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you it's plain as day so who's the Holy Ghost going to be ah well who's speaking right here Jesus he says I'm going to come to you I'm not going to leave you comfortless I'm gonna be the one that comes yet a little while in the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live you shall live also and at that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and the Holy Ghost In You I in you I mean you could say the Holy Ghost in you because that's who I is somewhere my high school English teachers went oh two we're talking about he's all of that he says the spirit is coming The Same Spirit that manifested as the father then manifested as the son and then came back on the day of Pentecost and manifested in many it's all the same it's all the same Lord Jesus Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament brother Brown says now that is the revelation Jesus Christ is God the Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Jesus of the new no matter how hard you try you can't prove there are three Gods but it also takes a revelation by the Holy Spirit to make you understand the truth that he is one it takes a revelation to see that the Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Jesus of the new this is why we don't baptize in titles this is why that Matthew 28 19 that doesn't confuse us go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost let me tell you a little story real quick brother Joe and I were baptizing at Youth Camp you've seen how we do it and they they come down everybody's around the swimming pool and we're standing there and this this brother that was getting baptized there at Camp was probably around you say about 40 years old brother Joe maybe 45 something like that he was a middle-aged fella and he comes walking out there and and and just to be honest with you when you're baptized in one after another like that you kind of get into a routine you know as you're going and and brother Joe will baptize one then I'll baptize one and brother Joe and this this brother Combs and I say I say you know the Lord commissioned me and sent me into the world and told me to baptize those that would believe in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost and right there that man he goes whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa right he said you are about to baptize me in the name of Jesus ain't you me and brother Joe had to kind of hold it together for me I said yes sir you just give me a minute that's it's coming next that's that's where we're going but it doesn't confuse us because we recognize that the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost are not names and it says baptize in thee name now I could Rock right here and I could say nephew son cousin could have called a lot of people but if I say let me know you know who I'm talking to don't you yeah the name what is that name have we got that established can we say it there we go we're getting there that's why we can look right here at Acts 2 38 then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost we obey Matthew 28 19. when we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we do that as you've heard brother Tim say in obedience to that Divine command I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they knew what that name was and there is not one place in scripture where they baptize any other way than in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Common Sense would tell you that the book of Acts is the church in action and if they baptize that way then that's the way to be baptized up until nasia the church always baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ brother brother Brandon says right up until the truth was lost and did not return until this last age unto this last stage this is from nicaea to the turn of the century they baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he says but it has come back Satan can't keep the Revelation down when the spirit wants to give it I say you are rejoicing that tonight because I'm telling you that the spirit's here tonight trying to give some of you Revelation trying to get you to recognize some of you that hey Mama this is talking to me I want to be a part of that Kingdom and the spirits begin to move and he's trying to he's been working in your life and he's been calling you to a repentance been calling you back to the house of God and the devil's fighting it the devil's saying oh that's not who you are you're never going to be an overcomer you're never going to be delivered but I want to tell what a prophet said Satan can't keep the Revelation down when the spirit wants to give it so when the Lord's working in your life tonight I just say thank you Lord Jesus I'm going to accept it I don't care what the devil says he can't stop it he can't keep me bound there's a revelation tonight that says you're free there's a revelation a night that says you're an overcomer there's Revelation going forth tonight saying that you are a child of the Living God that hell wasn't created for you but heaven was created for you and the devil's saying it's not you it's not you it's not about you but revelation will not be kept down when the spirit wants to give it I just accept it tonight as mine and say Lord I know you're going to break through I know it's going to come into my heart because the devil cannot stop what God is going to do Hallelujah Acts 2 36 therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom you crucified both Lord and Christ he says there he is the Lord Jesus Christ if Jesus is both Lord and Christ then he Jesus is and cannot be else but father Son and Holy Ghost in one person manifested in the flesh amen do you believe it tonight amen just a little bit further he says it is not God in three persons Blessed Trinity but one God one person with three major titles with three offices manifesting those titles hear it once more he says this same Jesus is both Lord and Christ Lord father Christ Holy Spirit our Jesus for he Jesus is both of them Lord and Christ he said if that doesn't show us the true revelation of the godhead nothing will Lord is not another one Christ is not another one this Jesus is the Lord Jesus Christ one God Hallelujah he says if Revelation is beyond you look up and seek God for it that is the only way you're ever going to get it if you feel like you just haven't been able to grasp it you feel like things are going over your head don't just go well I just don't understand he's saying if it's beyond you look up he says look up and and ask God for it seek God for it he says we need to call on God for Revelation more than anything else in the world he says it's not real to the majority of God's children that struck me it's not real what's that mean it's not that they don't believe it but it's not real it hasn't become revealed to them he says it's just a good verse in the Bible but we need to have it made alive to us and that will take Revelation listen I'm thankful for what Mama's done for me I'm thankful for what Daddy's done for me I'm thankful for the Christian homes and for what you have been taught but I'm saying tonight if Revelation is beyond you tonight is the night that he's calling you just to find out who do you say that I am he's calling you to know for yourself he's calling you to a revelation he's calling you to strive for he's calling you to seek for it he says we have accepted the Bible we have accepted the great truths of it but it's still not real to most people because the Revelation by the spirit is not there the word has not been quickened and I say maybe tonight before you came here you didn't understand I you know I didn't to the degree that I do now understand or realize the importance of seeking revelation but the prophet says seek more than anything else in the world right there that second one we need to call on God for Revelation more than anything else in the world why because a revelation given by the spirit can never be taken away from you by the arguments of man a revelation given by God can never be stripped away from you by man or the devil or by anything because once God gives it it's yours once he opened your eyes to something and reveals it to you it's yours forever First Corinthians 2 13 which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual he says but we need the same spirit that gave it to teach it to us oh how we need Revelation by the spirit we don't need a new Bible we don't need a new translation though some are very good but I am not against them he says and I am not against them but we need the revelation of the spirit and thank God we can have what we need for God wants to reveal his word to us by his spirit I got a quote here saying God wants to reveal himself to you in a quote just while ago that said and when he wants to reveal it the devil can't keep it down so I believe that we're going to come out of this time and that in your life as you begin to progress and seek Revelation from God you are going to Blossom you are going to bloom and as you begin to recognize who you are and what you stand for and that you can do the Greater Works that you will become a part of an invincible Army that will do terrible damage to Satan's kingdom and that's why he's fighting it so much now we're bringing this down I have four slides left I want you to key in on this as I became more aware of the importance of recognizing the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ it's a perfect blood those of you who are struggling those of you who the enemy tells you're not going to overcome you're not going to make it but it's not for you that you're always going to fall back into temptation that you're always going to fall back in into your addictions you're always going to fall back into your failures that you're never going to be that you're never going to be because your problems are too big your depression your anxiety is too much you'll never be free from your nervousness I'm always going to have that I'm if you fall into any of those categories any doubts right now lock in Revelations 1 5. and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful Witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the Earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood now listen Revelation is of the utmost importance to you and the revelation of who he is especially as it relates to what he has done is huge especially as it relates to what he's done for you because the word washed here is actually loosed why does the revelation of Jesus Christ as complete deity matter foreign it was his own blood that loosed us completely from our sins it was not human blood it was the blood of God Peter called it the blood of Christ it wasn't just some Prophet that died for you it wasn't some blood with limited power that it could overcome some things but it couldn't overcome pornography it couldn't overcome drugs it couldn't overcome family curses but it was a good man's blood it wasn't just a prophet it wasn't just a piece of the Trinity he was all of it this was the blood of Jesus Christ it was the blood of deity it was the blood of God it was the blood of the most perfect lamb and it was his blood that loosed you not just washed you but those chains that have held you those fear those anxiety those things that you're never going to be free from you'll always be fearful you'll always have anxiety he said no no no this is the blood of almighty God this is the blood of God it's greater than anxiety it's greater than drug addiction it's greater than family Cycles it's greater than your sins it's greater than the lion devil that said you ain't gonna make it because the spirit of God is here tonight and he's saying that's my blood that's my blood my blood is greater my blood is more powerful it is my blood that has loose you he says the omnipotent Jehovah God came down and made himself a body by means of the Virgin birth and indwelt it that it might be the blood of God that would free us loose us entirely from our sins and present us spotless before himself with exceeding great joy he goes on to say hallelujah God did not entrust his Plan of Salvation to to another he trusted only himself God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and redeemed us to himself were saved by the blood of God the Eternal God and throughout the Mortal body in order to take away sin I'm talking to somebody tonight I'm talking to somebody tonight that thinks their sin is too great somebody that thinks they've gone too far somebody that has believed the LIE of the devil for too long you are saved by the blood of God this isn't just some Prophet this isn't just God sent a message I'm so thankful for that this message is Jesus Christ but right now I'm talking about his sacrifice at Calvary it was a perfect blood and it has loosed you whether you recognize it tonight you are free those chains are breaking off your life even as we speak because faith is coming by hearing and you're recognizing I am going to overcome I am going to make it I am gonna be there I am going to Rapture it's a perfect blood for a perfect body for a perfect Rapture for a body change and it's calling out to you tonight hallelujah oh but brother Aaron you don't understand what I doesn't matter blood of God it's the blood of almighty God it's deity that is called out it took your place he says consider this since it is the blood of God it is perfect blood and if the perfect blood is loosing us from the power of bondage and defaming of sin then the loosing is perfect and complete I say be loose tonight I say be free tonight from whatever it is that's held you it's a perfect blood a perfect loosing there is now therefore no condemnation oh but you've done this the blood of God it's the blood of God he says the blood has loosed us there is now no condemnation How can there be there is nothing to be condemned for hear me hear me there is nothing to be condemned for I feel so condemned there is nothing to be condemned for because the blood has loosed us from sin we are free we are Guiltless don't listen to man listen to the word you are loosed by the blood tonight Hallelujah he says don't be led astray by listening to those that deny the power of the word and deny that Jesus saves heals fills with the Holy Ghost and power you are God's free men loosed by his own blood if your free man stand your feet and worship him like free people people that know that I've been set free I've been loose oh I'm not going to listen to the devil I'm not going to listen to one that tells me I can't have it that I can't overcome that I got to stay bound he says you are God's free man I want to say it to you again you who you talking to not me yes you are God's free men Loose by his own blood Hallelujah I'm talking to you tonight oh to the lowest of Sinners to anyone in the building you may have been backslidden you may have been kept from your joy you may have been kept from your peace I'm just not what I ought to be you are God's free man he says in Galatians 5 1 Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage I say walk out tonight walk out tonight you are God's free man and never again be entangled by that bondage never go back to it because the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ made it a perfect blood that loosed you that sets you free he closes this chapter by saying he's coming soon the alpha and Omega the prophet priest and King the all in all Lord God of host is coming soon even so Lord Jesus the one and only true God come quickly will you bow your heads with me for a moment sorry to have kept you as long as we have but I couldn't leave without getting to the perfect blood because I know I needed that perfect blood I set many as Services just like this as a young person as others labored and I sat there knowing I needed that perfect blood and yet that same spirit that would speak to brother Branham would tell me just wait a little longer just wait a little longer and in the waiting he does his damage and in the waiting he sows his seeds in the waiting he brings scars and in the waiting he brings more chains but in One Moment In The Presence of the perfect blood there can be a perfect loosing oh it's just a youth service brother Aaron it's just a Bible study it's just we're just going through the church age book that's right but if you need prayer tonight and you need to be loosed there's one in the building tonight he says I'm the one that created you I'm the one that died for you I'm the one that went to hell for you I rose again and sent my spirit back I'm the one that said in my name they shall cast out devils and he's calling you tonight and the devil is trying to keep that Revelation held down he's trying to keep it held down but right now the spirit's wanting to give it and when the spirit wants to give Revelation the devil can't stop it so if he's moving on your heart don't fight it if you want prayer tonight or you want to come new at this altar as we begin to worship for just a minute I want to give you that opportunity the desire of our heart in these studies is that we would have true revelation of what we read about and what we what we study and what we talk about not just a lesson I want you to draw closer to God I want all of us to draw closer to God I know that in the preparation for this it opened my eyes to many places where I needed to draw closer but right now I'll say it again if there's a devil lying to you and he's saying you can't be free I'm telling you the perfect blood is here to lose you from whatever the lies of the enemy are you can be free tonight you can be loosed Lord Jesus I just thank you Lord for the for the words of life for your for your perfect word Lord thank you that you came and took on flesh Lord I thank you that in this day it's been revealed to a prophetic class through a prophetic Ministry Lord I give you thanks that we can look into the scripture and see how it all lines up how it's all just perfect Lord I know I I can't teach it like many others can and I just pray tonight something will anchor in in the hearts of these young people and they'll see my God is one God my Lord Jesus is the all and all he's all of that he's the everything and Lord as the everything you're our savior you're our healer Lord you are the sole satisfier you are the deliverer right now Lord and you see the chains that would try to hold your people but tonight Lord I believe with all my heart that there is a perfect loosing available for your people because she will be without spot or wrinkle Lord this is the purchase of your blood and any hold that the enemy has tonight is unlawful Lord he has no rights he was stripped that day on Calvary and we speak freedom to the young people tonight I pray tonight that each one of them will recognize they don't have to stay they no longer have to be bound by fear no longer a Slave but Lord they may they be loosed in the name of the Lord Jesus Lord and just In This Moment In Your Presence as we take a moment I just pray that you'll continue to deal and speak and Lord that each one
