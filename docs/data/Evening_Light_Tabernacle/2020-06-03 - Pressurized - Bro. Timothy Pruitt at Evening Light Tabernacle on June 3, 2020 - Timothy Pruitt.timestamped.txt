[28:12] father Lord was so thankful that you are
[28:16] in control or when you first spoke this
[28:19] world into existence you haven't lost
[28:22] one moment of control and Lord we just

[28:27] scene tonight and you would bring peace
[28:29] to hearts and touch lives lord I pray or
[28:33] the enemy is coming Lord like a flood
[28:35] but Lord the scripture said you'd raise
[28:37] the standard up against it that standard
[28:40] is your word that standard is what we
[28:42] leaned upon that standard is what we
[28:44] draw strength from that standard is what
[28:47] we look at tonight and what we're going
[28:49] to look at your word and live and we
[28:52] just ask tonight Lord that you would
[28:53] just speak to a heart to touch our lives
[28:55] Lord forgive us Lord if there be
[28:58] anything that we've done that not be
[29:00] pleasing to You Father Lord let your
[29:02] Holy Ghost just reign in our hearts
[29:04] tonight let it flood this building Lord
[29:07] with a heavenly atmosphere or my Angel's
[29:10] garrison themselves around us Lord and
[29:12] begin to move in the other rounds Lord
[29:15] and push back the spirits of fear and
[29:17] dread and doubt and unbelief Lord and

[29:25] Lord everything to be said and done for
[29:28] your glory and for your honor or we
[29:30] speak these things tonight Lord is what
[29:32] is on a heart we just ask that you would
[29:35] just or give us the wisdom Lord what to
[29:37] say Lord and shut our mouths when we
[29:40] said enough
[29:41] would give ourselves to you in Jesus
[29:44] name Malachi chapter 3 in verse 1
[30:04] says behold I will send my messenger and
[30:07] he shall prepare the way before me and
[30:10] the Lord whom he seek shall suddenly
[30:12] come to his temple even the messenger of
[30:16] the Covenant whom he delight in behold
[30:19] he shall come saith the Lord of hosts
[30:21] but who may abide in the day of his
[30:24] coming and who shall stand when he
[30:26] appears for he is like a refiners fire
[30:29] and likes fuller soap and he shall sit
[30:34] as a refiner and a purifier of silver
[30:37] and he shall purify the sons of Levi and
[30:40] purge them as gold and silver that they
[30:43] may be offered unto the Lord and
[30:46] offering that they may offer unto the
[30:48] Lord an offering in righteousness
[30:51] amen will let you be seated like to
[30:59] speak to you this evening on pressure
[31:01] what fresh Erised pressurizer know we're
[31:05] living a great age of pressure and
[31:07] there's pressure all around us and it
[31:09] seems to be gaining every day you know
[31:12] brother Branham would speak about
[31:13] pressures and he would speak about AIDS
[31:16] day of Ages having pressures you speak
[31:19] about a thought tyre in church age talks
[31:21] about the Dark Age the pressure was
[31:24] either to bend or to be broken to bow or
[31:27] die
[31:28] it was the Inquisition and the power of
[31:31] em of the Empire backing up satanic
[31:34] worship being organized be organized or
[31:37] pay with your life see each age has its
[31:41] pressures for example the great burden
[31:44] of the last ages of pressure of riches
[31:46] soft living and nervous tensions
[31:49] tensions in a complex age that we seem
[31:52] unfitted to live in and I believe that
[31:56] don't seem like the tensions are getting
[31:58] any less it seems they're getting more
[32:00] you know it's one thing after another
[32:02] anymore as this new year has broken out
[32:06] on us you know we started with a plague
[32:08] that came upon the earth and you know
[32:10] whether a lot of it was government this
[32:13] that and the other I don't go get into
[32:15] all of that
[32:16] but you know it's just one thing after
[32:18] another on every side and now we have
[32:20] racial tensions and all things that are
[32:22] going on in the in this world and it's
[32:25] not going to get any better it's going
[32:27] to continue to get worse and it's going
[32:28] to continue to go down you know you know
[32:31] this this nation has been prophesied to
[32:34] be destroyed and you know and I know
[32:37] there's a lot of people that's crying
[32:38] pray for this nation pray for this
[32:40] nation but you know this nation this
[32:42] world is prophesied to be burnt with
[32:44] fire and and you know it's a place that
[32:47] is not a place to prepare for a future
[32:49] it's not a place to prepare for a you
[32:53] know a life here as far as in this world
[32:55] that we're living in this is not what
[32:57] we're here for
[32:57] we're here to leave this world and I
[33:01] think it's very very that we should have
[33:04] our mind made up that we're gonna keep
[33:05] our eye on one thing we're not gonna get
[33:08] drawn into political cynicism we're not
[33:10] going to draw it into whatever things
[33:12] that's on facebook or whatever things on
[33:14] social media that's not what our eyes
[33:16] are upon our eyes are upon another
[33:19] dimension and our eyes are our pone
[33:21] leaving here you know and and but in it
[33:24] for age of pressure or age of tension he
[33:28] would have to have a people who can take
[33:31] those those pressures or those tensions
[33:33] now you cannot take the pressures that
[33:35] that are in this age with your own human
[33:37] ability or your own human understand him
[33:39] because humanly you cannot understand
[33:42] how humans can treat other humans the
[33:44] way they treat them humanely you can't
[33:46] understand why the world or how the
[33:47] world is going this way and the way that
[33:50] it's going but the only way that you can
[33:52] take this pressure or the pressure of
[33:54] this age is to be pressurized is to have
[33:57] something around you as to as as song
[33:59] was singing thou art my shield
[34:01] thou art my dance my portion hey ma'am
[34:04] there's a people upon this earth that
[34:06] are pressurized they're not there their
[34:09] happiness or their joy is not determined
[34:10] on whether it's a good day or a bad day
[34:13] or or whether it's a good post on
[34:15] Facebook or bad put news on Facebook or
[34:17] bad news or good news on Fox News CNN or
[34:20] whatever you look at amen but they're
[34:22] there there everything about them is
[34:24] because is under a certain
[34:27] a pressure because they they're under
[34:30] another guidance earn under another
[34:32] realm a mam and you know as we lit read
[34:36] the scripture he said the scripture
[34:37] would speak about said he sits as a
[34:40] refiner or a purifier of silver now you
[34:43] know as you would put gold or you'd put
[34:45] silver in the fire it goes under a
[34:47] pressure it goes under you know it's
[34:49] intense heat and in 10 that builds up
[34:52] pressure in it
[34:53] but there's something that has taken
[34:54] place there's something that's going on
[34:56] as that pressure begins to build up
[34:58] around that gold or that silver and
[35:01] begins to aim and something begins to
[35:03] happen to it it begins to pull out the
[35:05] impurities are there and it begins to
[35:08] move and so it's very interesting that
[35:11] in this time that we're living in and
[35:13] this thing that we're going through that
[35:15] he said he shall sit as a refiner or a
[35:18] purifier of silver you know and I got to
[35:21] looking at this and I've come across a
[35:22] story of a people that was in a Bible
[35:26] study and they were studying this
[35:27] scripture and they begin to wonder what
[35:30] does this mean does this mean something
[35:32] about the character or the nature of God
[35:35] that he would sit as a refiner and he
[35:37] would sit over this and so this one
[35:39] person decided that she would go look up
[35:42] a silversmith him and make an
[35:43] appointment to watch him at work and and
[35:46] she began to watch as he would look at
[35:48] this and he would begin to heat the fire
[35:49] up and he would place the silver in
[35:51] there and he would he would hold the
[35:54] silver right in the middle of the fire
[35:56] where the flames were the hottest and
[35:58] and to burn away all the impurities and
[36:02] you know they did this person began to
[36:04] think how God is holding us in such a
[36:07] hot spot and we're in a hot spot if it
[36:11] ain't viruses is this over here is that
[36:14] over here it's a hurricane is coming as
[36:16] this that is always something we're in a
[36:18] very hot spot but you know she thought
[36:21] of you he thought this person thought
[36:23] again of this says God sitting as a
[36:26] refiner and she asked the silversmith of
[36:28] his truth that he had to sit in front of
[36:31] the fire the whole time the silver was
[36:33] being refined the man answered yes he
[36:36] not only had to sit there holding the
[36:38] silver but he had to keep his eyes on
[36:40] the sill
[36:42] hallelujah not only did he sit there
[36:45] holding the silver in the fire he kept
[36:47] his eyes on the silver and if this
[36:50] because he said if the silver was left
[36:52] even for one second too long in the
[36:55] flames it would be destroyed and then
[36:57] this person Allah silent for a minute
[36:59] and she said well then how do you know
[37:01] when the silver is ready to come out he
[37:03] smiled and answered oh it's easy when I
[37:05] see my image in it hallelujah and I'm
[37:09] thankful as we read the scripture and
[37:11] all the chaos and all the things that
[37:13] are going off on around us he hasn't
[37:15] taken taking his hand off of us hey man
[37:19] he hasn't taken his eye off of us
[37:21] proverbs 15 would say it like this the
[37:23] eyes of the Lord are in every place
[37:26] keeping watch on the evil and on the
[37:28] good
[37:29] amen so he keeps his eyes on us and
[37:32] second chronicles that saying for the
[37:34] eyes of the Lord run to and fro through

[37:53] while you're in this trouble I mean it
[37:55] may not mean you may not even be even
[37:57] tonight may be something totally
[37:58] different than what I'm even spoke about
[38:00] as far as the plagues or some political
[38:02] thing that's going on but it maybe it's
[38:04] something else maybe it's something
[38:05] personal but I want you to understand
[38:07] you may be in the fire but God's holding
[38:10] you there hey man he hasn't night and
[38:12] you may be in the fire but God's eyes
[38:15] are upon you hey man you know knowing
[38:17] that he is with you and nothing can harm
[38:20] you amen the fire is actually for your
[38:24] good the things that you're going
[38:26] through the trials of this life or
[38:28] actually for your good Amen that you
[38:30] shall come out of them as pure gold amen
[38:33] all these things worked out of your life
[38:35] and you can understand there's nothing
[38:37] can harm you there's neither powers
[38:39] there's neither things present there's
[38:41] another things future hallelujah there's
[38:45] nothing they're the things future so no
[38:47] matter what's coming in the future it's
[38:49] for our good it's far leaving here
[38:52] it's the
[38:53] is ready to leave nothing can separate
[38:56] us from him we are in him therefore we
[39:00] can take the pressures of this if you're
[39:02] in Christ you can take the pressures of
[39:04] this world hallelujah
[39:09] since we never caught your brother man
[39:11] will sit like this he's never we never
[39:12] come in by our own wheel but he by
[39:15] choice
[39:15] elected us and brought us into himself
[39:18] so it's his business to take care of of
[39:21] what he has taken into himself
[39:25] hallelujah don't you understand that
[39:27] you're in the fire but he's in the fire
[39:28] with you hallelujah he's taking you into
[39:33] himself it's his business to take care
[39:36] of you and it says no man can pluck you
[39:38] from my hands because he's a and he says
[39:41] it's the father who will take care of it
[39:43] and who's got more power than God
[39:47] there's government's a Mendes political
[39:51] political people and all this all this
[39:53] stuff that's going do they have more
[39:54] power than God come on somebody who has
[39:58] more power than God so what kind of
[40:01] power have you got that is holding you
[40:06] it's the power that created the universe
[40:10] it's the power that's holding the earth
[40:13] in this place it's the power that held
[40:16] the Sun there this morning it's the
[40:17] power that holds the Stars in their
[40:19] place that is the power that is holding
[40:22] you hallelujah amen it took the solar
[40:26] system anyway brother man I'm sitting
[40:29] with he was like that and it blew it out
[40:31] and every star went into its place and
[40:34] he's still holding there and that power
[40:37] is watching over you what kind of father
[40:41] do we have even you may be in the fire
[40:45] of sickness tonight but there's a father
[40:47] watching over you you may be in the fire
[40:49] of depression or the fire but fear the
[40:52] fire torment but there is a father that
[40:55] is watching over here and he's got his
[40:57] hands on you and he knows exactly the
[41:00] moment to snatch you out because he
[41:02] I'm not putting more on you than what
[41:04] you can bear but I'll make a way of
[41:06] escape and what is your way of escape
[41:09] tonight it's not too simple some party
[41:12] somewhere or some Republican or some
[41:14] Democrat or some government somewhere
[41:16] our way of escape it's not a government
[41:19] my way of escape this out of here
[41:21] however Escape is leaving this old file
[41:24] world that we're living in hallelujah
[41:27] that's what kind of father you have oh
[41:30] my he's watching everything he knows
[41:34] exactly when to take us out
[41:38] whoa be some pieces sweep over yard he
[41:43] knows exactly when the rapture said that
[41:45] button and we won't be left here a
[41:49] second too long but we're in age of
[41:54] pressure feels like it's coming from
[41:56] every side sickness deaths plagues
[42:00] political unrest but God is watching God
[42:05] sees it he has his hand on a brown his
[42:08] bride and he hasn't left the fire she's
[42:12] built for pressure amen it was a say
[42:15] here he tested this to make sure it
[42:17] would hold he he would go down to a
[42:20] river and be baptized in the Spirit of
[42:22] God would come upon him and indwell went
[42:24] inside of him and he tested it and it
[42:26] held him he tested that in intense
[42:30] pressure and political pressure of his
[42:32] day and unrest of his day and things
[42:35] going on in his day it held when he went
[42:38] to the Garden of Gethsemane and it said
[42:41] such pressure are you talking about
[42:42] pressure as he would fight amen as he
[42:45] would die and he would lay his life down
[42:46] and he would say not my will but thy
[42:49] will be done
[42:49] pressure he knows pressure he knows what
[42:52] it's like toads I have so much pressure
[42:54] on him till the sweat comes out like
[42:56] blood he knows all about pressure but it
[43:00] held as he walked to the cross inhaled
[43:06] as he took the nails in his hand they
[43:08] didn't take nails to hold him on the
[43:10] cross it held
[43:20] God always he would say it like this is
[43:22] that God always likens his people's to
[43:24] Eagles so he calls himself Jehovah eagle
[43:28] and we're his eaglets he said I made an
[43:32] illustration of many times how an eagle
[43:34] gets her little ones ready to fly and
[43:36] she takes him up in the air and turns
[43:38] him loose he said if a crow tried to get
[43:41] up there every feather would fall out of
[43:43] him
[43:43] he's not pressurized for it he can't
[43:46] stand the pressure but the Eagle is the
[43:49] only bird that's born with that kind of
[43:51] feather
[43:53] well you look different because I got a
[43:55] different feather that can go so high to
[43:59] a hawk can't even see around him he's
[44:02] hit the higher you go the further you
[44:04] can see and what good would it do a hawk
[44:05] to get up there if you don't have the
[44:07] eyes to see anyway he couldn't see back
[44:09] where it came from and he said that's
[44:10] the way it is with a Christian he said
[44:13] some of the people maybe got a buzzard
[44:15] this disposition and eating all the
[44:17] things of the world and the vultures and
[44:18] tried but trying to fly up with the
[44:21] Eagles if you try that you'll just blow
[44:23] up but there because there's too much
[44:27] pressure there a man you've got to be
[44:30] made for it and he was saying another
[44:33] place of my attention he said people
[44:34] want to paint a little a little almost a
[44:37] fairy tale on a mere exact words but and
[44:39] say when you come to Christ there's no
[44:41] tension he said when you come to Christ
[44:43] there's more tension than there's ever
[44:44] been a man but when you accept what when
[44:48] you're when you're pressurized or when
[44:50] you you have that spirit of that eagle
[44:52] inside of you you are made for that you
[44:57] know we know the story of him shooting a
[44:59] gun that was a different type of gun
[45:01] they tried to make it into a Weatherby
[45:03] my rifle I can no doubt get brother Mike
[45:05] up here and he can tell us all the all
[45:07] the caliber and this set and the other
[45:10] and exactly how it all went
[45:11] he's told me it before but that
[45:14] Weatherby that rifle was tried to be to
[45:17] me made into a wither B but it wasn't a
[45:20] Weatherby from the factory it was trying
[45:22] to maybe made into it maybe had some of
[45:24] the similar kind of steel on different
[45:26] things but it wasn't made to
[45:28] whether be to shoot a Weatherby rifle
[45:30] bull or the caliber that was a Weatherby
[45:33] powder or whatever he said but that's
[45:35] the way we find ourselves sometimes he
[45:37] said we find so many times that people
[45:40] just can't stand the pressure of being a
[45:43] Christian the pressure of being a
[45:50] Christian he said why it's because they
[45:53] have never died out to self and been
[45:56] born again hello somebody made from the
[46:02] dies of God to stand the load the
[46:05] pressure that comes against a real
[46:08] Christian
[46:09] he said you try to walk with a real
[46:10] saint of God and find that pressure hit
[46:13] against you you'll blow up and be back
[46:15] where you wants to begin with but if
[46:17] you've been born again and filled with
[46:19] God's Spirit then you're pressurized by
[46:22] God to stand the pressure
[46:25] you're pressurized by God to stand the
[46:28] pressure that the world can put against
[46:31] you but that must be first be born again
[46:39] he said he would talk about fish how
[46:41] they're pressured to live in a certain
[46:44] area you know I've I've been out with a
[46:46] deep-sea fishing you can actually when
[46:49] he pulled us fish up from so far down
[46:51] you pull them up and there's they're
[46:54] built for certain pressures a certain
[46:56] pressure down there can give you the
[46:57] exact but a certain is different than
[46:59] what you're up there on so when you
[47:00] bring them up they actually start
[47:02] blowing up and then you know if you go
[47:05] fishing they tell you to take take a
[47:07] something and they poke it in a certain
[47:09] spot and let that air back out and that
[47:11] fish a live but you know he said the
[47:13] fish is pressurized so it can live down
[47:16] there and if he comes up here to explode
[47:19] he said we're pressurized for the earth
[47:22] he said you said sea but said but what
[47:25] if that little fish would ever come to
[47:26] me would I ever want to go back to the
[47:28] midnight ink down there would ever want
[47:30] to be that kind of animal again and them
[47:32] kind of scientist insights and senses no
[47:34] sir I want to be a human
[47:36] he said now multiply that by a hundred
[47:39] million and I don't know maybe that's
[47:42] not even good enough but that's just
[47:44] almost an innumerable number a hundred
[47:46] million and then God has a chain has to
[47:49] change this mortal billion where we are
[47:52] and we're repressurized and taken up to
[47:55] his presence
[47:56] where we never want to be that kind of
[47:59] thing again far beyond that we're
[48:03] changed from the creature that we once
[48:05] was but you see people they're getting
[48:14] caught up in the political spirit
[48:19] they're getting caught up and supporting
[48:21] things they don't even know what they're
[48:22] supporting it's the truth
[48:27] well Johnny your breath bless me today
[48:29] with your prayer just touch me back
[48:32] there and sunders my hands shut up and
[48:34] begin to talk to the Lord and felt this
[48:36] presence move so near I'm so thankful
[48:39] brother Johnny that in this is this life
[48:42] that we live it ain't about how much

[48:47] about how what color you are or you're
[48:49] not come on somebody oh my it ain't
[48:57] about none of that there's so much
[48:58] confusion what's true what's false

[49:04] is the Word of God there's only one
[49:07] thing you can stand upon in this time

[49:11] God
[49:12] you can repost this and you can repost
[49:15] that I don't know if it's true or if
[49:17] it's false or what it is it doesn't make
[49:19] no difference to me

[49:44] you go it's depending upon what's on the
[49:46] inside hallelujah and there is a people
[49:51] that are ready for liftoff hallelujah

[54:15] nigh oh praise the Lord
[54:21] you know the achievements of men has
[54:24] been able to do with all these natural
[54:26] achievements it's happening on the earth
[54:29] well Brandon would say it's just a
[54:31] forerunner of a spiritual achievement
[54:34] that God has done by his church all the
[54:39] natural danger just types of the
[54:41] spiritual things he said well how's that
[54:43] well he said let's take transportation
[54:45] first transportation was walking then
[54:48] horse and then they'll automobile then
[54:51] science built us an airplane first one
[54:55] to move one horsepower and then car
[54:57] maybe 20 horsepower and airplane goes up
[54:59] to hundreds of horsepower and just so
[55:02] when we come with a horse and then the
[55:03] automobile was made the next thing is
[55:05] airplane we just keep achieving higher
[55:07] and higher greater and greater this is
[55:10] the achievement of science but this is
[55:13] only a forerunner of the spiritual
[55:15] things hallelujah amen listen if we see
[55:21] a man take off into another dimension we
[55:24] ought to have enough about us to realize
[55:26] we can come to church and leave this old
[55:28] dimension and worship God in spirit and
[55:31] truth leave our old funny feelings
[55:34] behind and old things that as our little
[55:36] fuzzy things is going on leave it all
[55:38] behind and just worship God hey man this
[55:41] is a forerunner of the spiritual things
[55:43] that happened of God by his Spirit has
[55:46] been in his promised word the natural
[55:49] man by knowledge looks backwards for his
[55:52] achievement that science see what God
[55:54] has done is a former creation they go
[55:56] out and pick up clods pick up pieces of
[55:58] rock fossils element
[56:00] I'm together see on that achievement
[56:02] they're taking what God has done and
[56:04] perverting it from the original estate
[56:06] and making it his living quarters and so
[56:08] forth and his economy a little better by
[56:10] what it has been created that's the
[56:13] natural achievement by man but God in
[56:16] the spiritual achievement is going
[56:18] forward not backward he's going forward
[56:23] looking into the word believing the
[56:25] promises for things that has never come
[56:27] yet for the spiritual revelations to
[56:29] manifest the spiritual things that God
[56:31] has promised he sees them come to pass
[56:33] just as a scientist in his laboratory
[56:35] are working on different things to help
[56:38] man take creation the taking creation
[56:41] the spiritual man is looking forward to
[56:44] something God promised and I want you to
[56:49] understand even a science progressed it
[56:51] wasn't go here and here and here and
[56:53] then go backwards
[56:54] no it's kept going forward one horse two
[56:57] horse fifty horse hundred horse thousand
[57:01] horse rockets view so if the physical
[57:08] world is doing at how much more is the
[57:09] spiritual world
[57:11] moving forward I'm not looking for less
[57:14] of God I'm looking for more of God I'm
[57:16] not looking for less of God's power I'm
[57:18] looking for more of God power I'm not
[57:20] looking for less of healings I'm looking
[57:22] for more of healings I'm not looking for
[57:25] less salvations I'm looking for more
[57:26] salvation I'm not looking for enough
[57:29] less of nothing - what comes to God I'm
[57:31] looking for more of God the natural
[57:37] church he says then taking back the
[57:40] natural so they look back to Phinny sank
[57:43] he nods Calvin that was alright but that
[57:46] was their day we on the other hand are
[57:48] looking forward to something else the
[57:51] promise that's greater and higher hey
[57:57] man what God has promised science goes
[58:00] back and picks it up but the Word of God
[58:03] goes forward
[58:07] so we see here science has been able to
[58:10] achieve more horsepower did it by taking
[58:14] the power and making greater instruments
[58:16] and automobiles and airplanes and God is
[58:19] achieving in the same manner way back in
[58:22] the loot days of Luther their power was
[58:24] horse power by getting Luther in his
[58:27] hands by God getting Luther in his hands
[58:29] in the fire the refiner in the fire
[58:33] sitting at the fire controlled out of a
[58:37] great organization out of a great system
[58:39] he let the man see that just shall live
[58:42] by faith and when he was able to achieve
[58:44] justification and preach it and the
[58:46] church came to life it come to life and
[58:49] begin to move just a little bit back
[58:51] under the days of one horsepower when
[58:55] the horsepower was ready to get fade out
[58:57] Nick and all the sudden of the carriage
[58:59] and the horse and buggy hit now he
[59:01] achieved justification and moved on a
[59:04] little further and a little further down
[59:06] the road
[59:07] Amen justified by faith and now
[59:09] sanctification by the spirit it was a
[59:12] man named John Wesley under his control
[59:16] it took him out of all the isms away
[59:18] from him he was able by John Wesley to
[59:21] bring the church into sanctification
[59:23] moving forward the automobile now moving
[59:28] forward could you imagine the first time
[59:32] a man you see funny videos of people
[59:38] doing things to their old folks you know
[59:39] and putting these new-age technologies
[59:42] on them and things could you imagine and
[59:44] now today Oh a car isn't it just
[59:46] everyday thing is this a progress and
[59:49] it's gotten greater and bigger and
[59:51] better and all that I had more functions
[59:53] and more buttons and more of this and
[59:54] that the other but it's still a car when
[59:55] you get down with the bones of it it's
[59:57] still a car and so and so anyway when
[1:00:01] when they when they could you imagine
[1:00:03] the first person has it maybe living to
[1:00:06] stick somewhere and all he knew was a
[1:00:07] horse and well here it comes his put put
[1:00:09] things up his driveway and the guy says
[1:00:11] get in
[1:00:17] it's safe get in take a lot of
[1:00:21] convincing to convince a man like that
[1:00:23] and you go on down to the next stage
[1:00:26] they're playing God might have been
[1:00:29] doing pretty good in a car but I love a
[1:00:31] sudden you're telling me to getting
[1:00:32] something that's going to leave this
[1:00:34] good old terra cotta there's earth that
[1:00:37] I'm standing on and you're gonna tell me
[1:00:38] to getting something to leave this place
[1:00:41] no if he didn't know about it didn't see
[1:00:43] all the things that were going on and
[1:00:45] maybe miss the days of over and Wilbur
[1:00:48] Wright he missed all of that and all of
[1:00:50] a sudden somebody comes to getting this
[1:00:51] thing where we going we're going to
[1:00:52] Walmart no we're going up there hub
[1:00:54] where it was a progression it was moving
[1:00:58] things were taking place and you can see
[1:01:02] even and that why the Lutheran's didn't
[1:01:03] want to go on with the Westlands and the
[1:01:07] Westlands didn't want to go on with the
[1:01:09] Pentecostals and the Pentecostals don't
[1:01:11] want to go on with us hey man
[1:01:16] see sanctification raised the church to
[1:01:19] his feet and got it able to walk now at
[1:01:22] the end of Wesley's age was automobile
[1:01:24] we realized he said now see every former
[1:01:27] comes out at the end of the age we find
[1:01:29] out the Weslie at the last of his church
[1:01:31] agent comes just before the Pentecost we
[1:01:33] did see the church got enough strength
[1:01:35] through sanctification to walk away from
[1:01:37] the things of the world separated for
[1:01:41] the glory of God it's too bad it lost
[1:01:43] that but it got strength enough Luther
[1:01:48] gave it light into the horse and buggy
[1:01:49] Wesley gave it life through
[1:01:51] sanctification separating the self from
[1:01:53] the world and then through the little
[1:01:55] branches of pilgrim holiness and
[1:01:56] Nazarene let's learn more down through
[1:01:58] the sanctification but remember it
[1:02:01] couldn't stay still the pillar of fire
[1:02:04] kept moving ke mezuzah street
[1:02:08] represented their playing days from the
[1:02:10] automobile God was able by the Wright
[1:02:12] brothers to take a motor in a little
[1:02:14] same kind of metal same kind of
[1:02:16] everything but have just a little design
[1:02:18] different design to it and make it lift
[1:02:20] off this earth mercy when the Holy
[1:02:25] Spirit fell on the Zuza Street
[1:02:27] supernatural was made known
[1:02:30] no tongues fell in things were happening
[1:02:32] miracles were taking place a man what
[1:02:35] happened he said would notice all these
[1:02:37] things are achievements he said but the
[1:02:41] Spirit of God is still moving home see
[1:02:47] he always does it that way he told us in
[1:02:49] the sides and watch for the signs OB in
[1:02:51] the sky that things would be happening
[1:02:53] just we just read the scripture just
[1:02:54] before the coming of Christ we see that
[1:02:57] it's only a pointings flood it's only
[1:03:00] saying look look what's taking place we
[1:03:03] see science where they're at but we all
[1:03:07] see won't see what God has achieved by
[1:03:09] his church don't ever forget that what
[1:03:13] God is achieved by his church you know
[1:03:19] man don't the far as I know is there
[1:03:21] anybody in here that want to go back to
[1:03:22] a horse and buggy and to be honest with
[1:03:28] you if you had the money and the ability
[1:03:30] to own maybe a helicopter or airplane to
[1:03:32] take you off on trips you wouldn't ever
[1:03:34] want to go back to a - it - it to a car
[1:03:40] and I've seen some of you post if y'all
[1:03:43] could have got on that rocket you did
[1:03:44] got on it but see what is it a horse and
[1:03:52] buggy
[1:03:52] - a car it's just more horses than just
[1:03:57] more power horse them buy a car - uh-uh
[1:04:03] airplane what is it is just more horses
[1:04:05] at it it's just more something going
[1:04:08] home when John Wesley found
[1:04:10] sanctification a set-aside work from
[1:04:13] justification he didn't condemn
[1:04:14] justification is only more power added
[1:04:17] to it when the Pentecostals found the
[1:04:19] baptism the Holy Ghost the restoration
[1:04:21] the gifts they never denied
[1:04:23] sanctification or justification they
[1:04:25] just went more power and raised up and
[1:04:27] went on more while they had more
[1:04:29] powernow all those things foreshadowing
[1:04:34] as they come up
[1:04:35] what was it God's achievement in his
[1:04:37] church and we find from the Azusa Street
[1:04:42] planes took off over we're a great
[1:04:44] revival swept the world heavenly places
[1:04:47] speaking in unknown tongues gifts war
[1:04:50] the world being burnt over by God got
[1:04:53] his hands on a group of people in the
[1:04:55] fire me going down he said what happened
[1:05:05] says she left these intellectual
[1:05:08] churches grounded pinnacles left these
[1:05:12] intellectual churches grounded when
[1:05:14] Pentecost took office speaking in
[1:05:16] tongues and gifts of healing they healed
[1:05:18] the sick they done great things they've
[1:05:20] done it there's no doubt but what
[1:05:21] they've done is proof what they've done
[1:05:23] sure it did they left this intellectual
[1:05:25] church sitting on the ground saying well
[1:05:27] you can't do this and you can't do that
[1:05:31] brother Branham used as a statement I
[1:05:34] tried to look it up and I couldn't find
[1:05:35] it anywhere and I don't know what it's
[1:05:36] referring to maybe somebody here
[1:05:38] somebody out there that's in this time
[1:05:40] frame might know what it's meant but he
[1:05:42] said like a little boy in jail for
[1:05:44] shooting the gumbo a gumbo only I know
[1:05:49] about gumbo is eating it I thought maybe
[1:05:53] something to do with marbles or song I
[1:05:54] don't know shooting a gumbo but somebody
[1:05:57] came in and said the little boy came in
[1:05:58] to visit him who had he got throwed in
[1:06:00] jail he said all they can't put you in
[1:06:01] jail for that and he said they can't and
[1:06:04] he was because he was said what you mean
[1:06:05] they Caine I'm already here so browner
[1:06:08] wasn't nothing that seemingly he put in
[1:06:10] jail for whatever it was he said Vidal
[1:06:12] they can't look I'm already here and he
[1:06:14] said that's the way they say about the
[1:06:16] Holy Ghost
[1:06:17] they say the Holy Ghost is for another
[1:06:20] age that's what they think it's here
[1:06:28] hallelujah we know it's here we've been
[1:06:31] flying in the air under the influence of
[1:06:34] it amen seeing the things that the
[1:06:37] intellectual people know nothing about
[1:06:39] only thing they can do is sit down there
[1:06:42] and sing and just make fun of it he said
[1:06:44] like a little cat from the stall one
[1:06:46] time you know the story out of the stall
[1:06:48] I said well you know he's big fat and
[1:06:50] round and sassy he jumped out of the
[1:06:52] stall when he's let out on that
[1:06:53] beautiful day and he began to kick it up
[1:06:55] his heels and and shout or you can move
[1:06:57] and have a good time he said what was he
[1:06:59] had a fine farmer that fed him good
[1:07:00] vitamins all year round the other old
[1:07:03] lazy farmer over there had this little
[1:07:04] calf born in the winter and a little
[1:07:06] fella hadn't eaten nothing but weeds and
[1:07:08] when he come out he's so poor he
[1:07:10] couldn't hardly move and every time the
[1:07:12] wind would blow it shove him sideways he
[1:07:14] said they'd seen this little fat calf up
[1:07:16] there kicking his heels and having a
[1:07:18] great time and he goes huh fanaticism he
[1:07:21] said well what was the difference the
[1:07:23] different was one was full of good
[1:07:25] vitamins he said no wonder he could kick
[1:07:28] up his heels he said and when a man is
[1:07:31] filled with the Holy Ghost there's
[1:07:33] something in him that's full of God's
[1:07:35] spiritual vitamins
[1:07:37] it makes him want to praise God for what
[1:07:40] he's done it makes him on a shout it
[1:07:42] makes him want to act different why he's
[1:07:44] no longer out to bound he's in the
[1:07:50] heavens he's left them earthbound on
[1:07:53] their bicycles and their automobiles
[1:07:55] saying days of miracles are past ain't
[1:07:59] no such a thing as a Holy Ghost saying
[1:08:04] we're here like Jesus was at the cross
[1:08:07] the spirit left him now we're here by
[1:08:09] ourselves baloney
[1:08:14] when that spirit lifts off that is the
[1:08:17] power that's taken us
[1:08:23] he's about friends may I say this it has
[1:08:27] come to the age of the astronaut we got
[1:08:31] more power now did you hear me did you
[1:08:35] hear the prophet of God we got more
[1:08:37] power now how many believes that the
[1:08:45] astronaut ages here we're coming to the
[1:08:47] spiritual age of the astronaut it's the
[1:08:49] same spirit only more power only lifting
[1:08:52] us up power and the higher we go and the
[1:08:55] more we can believe and the more like
[1:08:58] Christ not the automobile not the horse
[1:09:00] and buggy not in the airplane but the
[1:09:02] astronaut moving us up above each one
[1:09:05] it's called the Eagle H in the Bible God
[1:09:07] calling his prophets Malachi for the
[1:09:10] promise of the last days God is able now
[1:09:12] to achieve for himself a bride he's
[1:09:17] going to in the last days be able to get
[1:09:20] a bride hello to somebody he said well
[1:09:23] look at all this chaos he's going to be
[1:09:25] and the last in the last age able to get
[1:09:29] himself a bride with the ministry that's
[1:09:33] so exactly like a man whose wife becomes
[1:09:35] one so exactly like him went to Hobart
[1:09:39] gets to his fish people like him he
[1:09:41] lives and his people they are one
[1:09:45] he's a dinner will fulfill the scripture
[1:09:47] John 14:12 he that believeth on me the
[1:09:51] works that I do shall he do also I'll
[1:09:55] come on somebody not a prophet a people
[1:10:04] and it will also fulfill what Jesus said
[1:10:07] would take place as it was in the days
[1:10:10] of Sodom so shall I be in this coming of
[1:10:13] the Son of Man but I astronaut age the
[1:10:17] astronaut sees things that the horse
[1:10:20] rider and the automobile and the
[1:10:22] airplanes and either sees he goes higher
[1:10:29] did you hear me he sees things greater
[1:10:32] and
[1:10:33] beyond what we can see those astronauts
[1:10:35] up there not seeing the riots they're
[1:10:40] not seeing the co vid 19 they're not
[1:10:43] seeing all the political unrest and the
[1:10:44] problems all over the world and wars and
[1:10:47] rumors they're not seeing none of that
[1:10:48] they've traveled around the earth about
[1:10:50] seventeen hundred two hundred seventeen
[1:10:53] thousand two hundred miles an hour 16
[1:10:57] sunrises and sunsets a day that's moving
[1:11:03] and we're called to be astronauts
[1:11:09] they're moving faster than the problems
[1:11:14] they're moving faster than the sickness
[1:11:16] they're moving faster than the unrest
[1:11:19] and the problems going on in this earth
[1:11:21] they're moving around and around and
[1:11:23] around and around we have been called to
[1:11:29] this heavenly atmosphere to this place
[1:11:32] not to be and we're not to be in a
[1:11:34] bicycle no more not an automobile no
[1:11:41] more seeing all the problems around us
[1:11:44] and all the things and our focus it's
[1:11:46] all out there somewhere he said just as
[1:11:53] sure as God has testified by the natural
[1:11:56] things happening here so is he
[1:11:59] testifying that if we have achieved an
[1:12:01] astronaut God has achieved what he
[1:12:04] promised to achieve in the last days
[1:12:06] according to Malachi for only thing he
[1:12:08] has to do is get somebody in his hands
[1:12:13] that can cut loose from the airplanes
[1:12:16] and the automobiles and whatsoever Lord
[1:12:18] that's keeping you art bound not look
[1:12:27] back to what it was but more power to
[1:12:31] lift him high and lift him into the
[1:12:33] presence of God lift you up where all
[1:12:36] things are possible see that's what's
[1:12:42] happening listen I I can't help but
[1:12:44] believe
[1:12:46] as he says he's speaking about here in
[1:12:48] the countdown of what the natural types
[1:12:51] of spiritual and here we are again in
[1:12:53] this year amidst all this chaos a rocket
[1:12:57] takes full out the spiritual astronaut
[1:13:07] goes above the planes planes are
[1:13:10] wrecking up fussing in the clouds and
[1:13:14] did you hear that fussing in the clouds
[1:13:17] that where Facebook is in the clouds
[1:13:21] Instagram in the clouds our problem is
[1:13:24] our heads are in the clouds and not on
[1:13:27] the coming of the Lord this is why you
[1:13:31] get people so discouraged and people
[1:13:32] posting this and posting that and
[1:13:34] posting this they've got their eyes on
[1:13:36] the wrong thing either we believe this
[1:13:40] message or we don't believe it it gets
[1:13:49] greater gets more airplanes are still
[1:13:53] down there wreck and fuss and grounded
[1:13:55] everything like that but the astronauts
[1:13:57] that are not grounded he goes above the
[1:14:00] clouds he goes above the Creed's he goes
[1:14:02] beyond the denomination's above what
[1:14:04] anyone says is this isn't so or that is
[1:14:06] so he has got a God and that God is the
[1:14:10] Holy Spirit and the word tells him so
[1:14:13] and he moves on how does the science
[1:14:15] make an astronaut he takes what power
[1:14:18] they got and it keeps going into it and
[1:14:20] going into and further and further until
[1:14:22] he can move out of this atmosphere into
[1:14:26] another he said what does how does he
[1:14:28] find out how to do this he takes what's
[1:14:31] off paper and he figures it out and the
[1:14:34] same thing as any man can sit down and
[1:14:36] read the Word of God and see what's
[1:14:38] promised searched the scriptures search
[1:14:41] the scriptures in them you think you
[1:14:42] have eternal life said Jesus he said
[1:14:45] that earthbound BOTS they head back
[1:14:46] there in them days didn't know who he
[1:14:49] was but he said you begin to take it off
[1:14:54] the pages and put it into action that's
[1:14:59] exactly what they've done they drew
[1:15:00] they drew and they drew and they drew
[1:15:02] and they drew and they drew and they
[1:15:04] drew all kind of blueprints for rockets
[1:15:06] and rocket fuel and how to do this and
[1:15:08] how to do their test and test but one
[1:15:10] day it was time to take it off the paper
[1:15:12] and put it on the pad and get ready to
[1:15:16] light it up
[1:15:17] hey man it's time that we get off the
[1:15:20] paper we're gonna be written epistles
[1:15:22] read of all men living a living voice
[1:15:25] not just quoting the scripture but
[1:15:28] living a scripture not just quoting a
[1:15:30] quote but living a quote not just
[1:15:33] quoting some man this and something but
[1:15:35] living the gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:15:38] define ever devilled define ever spirit
[1:15:41] of hell define sickness right to his
[1:15:44] face and say by my His stripes I am
[1:15:46] healed and that stryn OTT he moves out
[1:15:58] beyond all those things he's not bound
[1:16:01] by the car anymore do all he can see is
[1:16:04] right around him all he can see is the
[1:16:07] things on this earth that's going on no
[1:16:10] he's seeing them different place he said
[1:16:13] when the astronauts in the air there's
[1:16:16] something controlling him
[1:16:18] it's called radar and I'm sure it's
[1:16:21] developed even further ZnO doubt beyond
[1:16:23] the 664 radar moves him shows him where
[1:16:29] is that tells him what he's doing and
[1:16:31] it's directing him that's an astral
[1:16:34] astronaut
[1:16:35] I watched them as they would they would
[1:16:39] had lifted off and this you know parts
[1:16:41] fell away and this set and they go onto
[1:16:43] there and they get ready as I spoke
[1:16:44] about his Sunday a little bit and they
[1:16:46] got lined up with that International
[1:16:48] Space Center and they begin to move and
[1:16:51] you see this little puffs they look like
[1:16:52] puffs of smoke would blow out this way
[1:16:54] or blow out this way and then one day
[1:16:56] they were lining up to a perfect
[1:16:59] connection what do you think's going on
[1:17:04] in this age that we're living here he's
[1:17:07] the refiner and he's holding you this
[1:17:10] may pull over here and it pulls it over
[1:17:12] here and it put but just keep your eyes
[1:17:15] we're lining up for a perfect connection
[1:17:24] the spiritual astronaut has a control
[1:17:26] power it has a control tower it has a
[1:17:29] power in a control tower
[1:17:30] isn't it it's not down here it's like
[1:17:32] the like man is it's up there it's the
[1:17:34] Holy Ghost that's in him that's
[1:17:36] controlling him the tower of the baptism
[1:17:39] of the Holy Ghost it's under control it
[1:17:44] keeps him in control by the word not a
[1:17:47] bunch of fanaticism not a bunch of
[1:17:49] whooped up nonsense but thus sayeth the
[1:17:51] Lord and it happens it's always under
[1:17:54] control he's got a control tower that's
[1:17:57] the Holy Ghost then the word is his
[1:17:59] program and he lays right in that
[1:18:01] program and the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:04] and douse him to move out and it brings
[1:18:07] him over this way and it brings him over
[1:18:09] that way to get him in perfect line to
[1:18:14] achieve what God wants to be achieved
[1:18:17] for his people my he goes on down he
[1:18:29] talks about the clock ticking to
[1:18:31] midnight and the destruction that's
[1:18:33] going on then it is about to take place
[1:18:35] in this world this world is about to
[1:18:37] burn with fire that's not a man's words
[1:18:40] that's these words and either we either
[1:18:44] we believe it or we don't
[1:18:49] he said the clock of science they say
[1:18:52] it's three minutes to midnight I almost
[1:18:54] wonder how many seconds we got to
[1:18:56] midnight we're at the end they have
[1:19:01] found the thing that will destroy them
[1:19:05] it's here what's going to destroy this
[1:19:09] earth it's already here it ain't waiting
[1:19:12] to be developed it's not in some
[1:19:14] development someone it's already here
[1:19:20] they found the thing that will destroy
[1:19:22] them they found everything the astronaut
[1:19:24] can get in the air and go over with the
[1:19:27] atomic power
[1:19:28] powers of simpler and say surrender or
[1:19:30] be blowed up three minutes until
[1:19:32] midnight they have worked on what God
[1:19:33] had done they biz able to provide it
[1:19:35] instead of trying to make life they're
[1:19:37] always trying to find a way to kill
[1:19:38] somebody or I don't do the next thing or
[1:19:41] beat the next nation or beat the next
[1:19:42] place that's what you're trying to do
[1:19:44] but man looks on calling man his brother
[1:19:47] and trying to lead him to home where he
[1:19:49] won't have to die one is death the
[1:19:50] others is life but these and death only
[1:19:53] does that represent life he said the
[1:19:54] clock is ticking upon the achievement of
[1:19:57] science today three minutes to midnight
[1:19:59] God's great clock is still ticking
[1:20:01] though Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:20:04] today and forever we have arrived
[1:20:12] he says one is clicking to death one is
[1:20:15] clicking to life one is clicking the
[1:20:18] destruction one is clicking to get out
[1:20:20] of here he says we have arrived the
[1:20:23] works that I do shall you do also we
[1:20:27] have arrived hello somebody we are here
[1:20:32] and just as the powers are here to
[1:20:36] destroy the earth the power to fulfill
[1:20:38] the Word of God is here right now and
[1:20:42] the works that he did shall we do also
[1:20:46] and even greater than these things shall
[1:20:50] we do more Jesus Christ the same
[1:21:00] yesterday today and forever he's on the
[1:21:03] earth and the power of the Holy Ghost to
[1:21:05] make the word live and do for his church
[1:21:07] that's exactly what he promised it to do
[1:21:09] and he's filling his astronauts whoa how
[1:21:16] do we maybe I need to preach that to you
[1:21:17] he's on the earth in the power of the
[1:21:21] Holy Ghost to make his word live and do
[1:21:24] his church do for his church exactly
[1:21:26] what he promised it would do it's a
[1:21:30] power here to fulfill everything that
[1:21:33] the word has been spoke
[1:21:35] and it's filling his astronaut his
[1:21:37] astronaut so not for destruction not for
[1:21:41] death
[1:21:42] not for plagues not for political unrest
[1:21:45] it's less filling us up to leave this
[1:21:47] old world to leave it all behind so they
[1:21:56] got in their big scientific tube he says
[1:21:59] not long ago astronaut tube taking the
[1:22:03] countdown headed for the moon they're
[1:22:05] going off of here too they got an
[1:22:08] astronaut in a big tube powered by
[1:22:10] atomic power where they can send it
[1:22:13] plumb to the moon they claim they got in
[1:22:16] a tube and we're waiting for the
[1:22:17] countdown the spiritual astronaut has
[1:22:21] also gotten to Christ and is listening
[1:22:26] to the countdown of the word what are
[1:22:32] you listening to tonight hello somebody
[1:22:35] what do you listen to tonight are you
[1:22:38] listening to the countdown of the world
[1:22:39] or the word is that he said now you
[1:22:50] Lutheran's ought to shout you Baptist
[1:22:52] Presbyterian watch the countdown of the
[1:22:55] word and we're not headed to the moon
[1:22:58] we're headed for heaven
[1:23:00] [Music]
[1:23:03] they'll pass the moon so fast they won't
[1:23:05] even see it waiting for the countdown
[1:23:08] what are they're doing they're wrapped
[1:23:10] in Christ and rapture and grace nothing
[1:23:12] they did themselves Christ took the
[1:23:14] uneducated the foolish things of the
[1:23:16] world wrapped his and astronauts in it
[1:23:18] and empowered them with the Holy Ghost
[1:23:20] for what to take off this world is going
[1:23:23] to be left alone to burn I don't think
[1:23:34] it's coincidence that there's people on
[1:23:36] this earth today they're supposed to be
[1:23:39] highly educated people that says we
[1:23:41] never went to the moon there's still
[1:23:47] people even message people apparently
[1:23:48] that I've heard believes this is a flat
[1:23:50] earth somebody's got a virus or I just
[1:23:58] called the Moroni virus listen there's
[1:24:04] viruses I was think about this today
[1:24:06] there's viruses out there that I'm a lot
[1:24:07] more scared of than Corona
[1:24:10] it's viruses of laodicea that are
[1:24:15] inflicting people and you see it out
[1:24:18] there they put it out there for the
[1:24:19] world to see no shame yet say their
[1:24:23] message they're not message they got a
[1:24:27] virus and people are today or say it
[1:24:32] ain't there and never went to the moon
[1:24:33] and got all these conspiracy stuff no
[1:24:35] idea no doubt they're trying to denied
[1:24:37] the super into the power that took an
[1:24:39] astronaut off of the earth into another
[1:24:42] atmosphere and you see it in the
[1:24:45] spiritual realms there's no such a thing
[1:24:50] as a prophet there's no such a thing as
[1:24:53] a man who's seen the other side
[1:24:55] come on somebody same spirit
[1:25:00] it's a demonic spirit let me tell you
[1:25:05] what we're seeing today in this earth is
[1:25:07] not god it's the denominator it has
[1:25:10] taken over the minds of men but there's
[1:25:15] also another people that's being taken
[1:25:18] over like we heard Sunday
[1:25:19] now with the mind of some psychotic or
[1:25:23] some denominator D demonic spirit but
[1:25:25] the mind of Jesus Christ it is so far
[1:25:28] far into this world and they're thinking
[1:25:30] that they think we're the ones that's
[1:25:32] crazy
[1:25:35] we're the ones that's crazy to believe a
[1:25:38] man could leave this atmosphere and to
[1:25:40] go somewhere else
[1:25:42] we're the one that's crazy to believe in
[1:25:44] a body change we're the one that's crazy
[1:25:46] to believe that God can heal
[1:25:47] we're the ones that's crazy to believe
[1:25:49] that we can shout and sing and dance and
[1:25:51] praise of God that they don't think
[1:25:53] exists the ear infected with a virus and
[1:25:59] as a virus much worse than Corona when
[1:26:04] John Glenn and I asked him not God in a
[1:26:06] big tube to take off the nation stood
[1:26:08] speechless they didn't know that morning
[1:26:11] when he took off when he did he got in
[1:26:12] the - everybody's crying waiting
[1:26:14] watching nation stood spellbound TVs
[1:26:16] blare and everything so everybody could
[1:26:18] see they're not sure I couldn't see it
[1:26:20] because they had to put it on a
[1:26:21] television so the world could see it he
[1:26:23] said when he got placed up in the tube
[1:26:24] just right and when he did they started
[1:26:26] ten nine eight seven six five four three
[1:26:32] two one zero and off there if he lifted
[1:26:41] begin to catch fire beneath him begin to
[1:26:44] break and the smoke begin to roll and
[1:26:46] all of a sudden is that things shimmered
[1:26:48] and they begin to move that big tube
[1:26:50] took off in the air into the unknown
[1:26:52] somewhere he took off in man's
[1:26:54] achievements the greatest achievement
[1:26:57] man has ever had but let me tell you
[1:26:59] that's just a small thing
[1:27:02] one of these morning's one of these
[1:27:06] morning's God's achievement of his
[1:27:09] astronauts that have climbed into Jesus
[1:27:11] Christ and been born by the Spirit of
[1:27:13] God filled with this power Oh hallelujah
[1:27:16] one of these morning the whole universe
[1:27:19] will be screaming and wailing and
[1:27:21] gnashing of teeth when they realize they
[1:27:24] missed it but that great Eagle powered
[1:27:26] by the Holy Ghost and fire whoa
[1:27:29] hallelujah it begins to spread her wings
[1:27:32] and the astronaut will take off and go

[1:27:54] what a moment that's going to be but the
[1:27:57] only way you're gonna realize that it's
[1:27:59] because you've been pressurized by the
[1:28:01] Holy Ghost to take off from this
[1:28:03] dimension into another world however I
[1:28:08] believe there's a people on this earth
[1:28:09] that is not they they're not pressurized
[1:28:11] or not not under the proton and the
[1:28:14] influence of some denomination
[1:28:16] demonic spirits somewhere or some
[1:28:18] satanic thing somewhere or some
[1:28:20] political thing somewhere that's not
[1:28:22] where they're getting their influence
[1:28:24] but they're getting it from the mind of
[1:28:25] Jesus Christ and they're sitting on a
[1:28:28] power that's greater than any power ever
[1:28:31] known to the earth it is a power that
[1:28:34] raised the man for days from the dead it
[1:28:36] is a power that changed the life and one
[1:28:39] moment was a drunkard and the next day
[1:28:41] of sober man is a power that took a
[1:28:43] chain-smoker
[1:28:44] and sheathe wrote it down and never
[1:28:46] smoked again it's a power that raised
[1:28:48] you up and you were and you up were
