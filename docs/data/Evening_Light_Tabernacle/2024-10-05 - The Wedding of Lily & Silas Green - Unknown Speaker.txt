[Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all rise [Music] who gives this woman to be married to this man her mother and I do you may have your seat could we bow our hearts for a word of prayer Our Kind Heavenly Father we come here on this special occasion at the joining of two hearts that you've put together we want to thank you for these two lives that have surrendered their heart to you and now they surrender to one another to be United we ask Lord that your loving hand would be upon them to bless them in their Union in the lovely name of Jesus Christ we pray amen wow what a what a special occasion here this afternoon to gather together I know the hearts of the Paris family and also the Green family is just swelling tonight with pride and we're so happy happy together for them going to read from Mark 10 and verse 6 as we look to the scripture and appeal to the words of almighty God for this moment but from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female and for this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one one flesh so then they are no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God hath joined together let not man put a ther what we're witnessing today is the ceremony of the oldest institution in the world before there was death sickness which are all the results of unbelief there was marriage marriage was before kingdoms and before governments marriage is truly Timeless and what is so important for us to understand is that marriage is not simply some man's idea man has tried to make it an idea but it is not something that man thought of first therefore it is not something that can be easily thrown aside it is not something that you can just vote away either in government or in lifestyle it is not something that you can change the value of or the meaning of without consequences if marriage was just an idea then we could ignore it or perhaps even discard it but because marriage comes from God's Own desire then it is doubly important to do it God's will way what we know about God is that he always brings things in harmony God is one of Perfect Balance that's why he created the heavens and the Earth and he brought everything in Perfect Balance nothing was out of Harmony everything was created for something else they are created to give and as God was created he created the Earth the Seas and he called it good and he created animals and he called them good he created plant life and called it good but as men dwelt alone after all of creation was finished God made the statement it is not good that man should be alone remember God makes everything run in harmony so so in order to achieve good out of what he saw was not good he fashioned out of the man the woman then it was good as the Book of Proverbs says whosoever findeth the wife findeth a good thing and obtaineth favor from the Lord and this is God's perfect balance a man and a woman God has brought together God's son and God's daughter and what is important to realize about the first man and woman is that before they met one another they met God and that became the glue that saved them and saved their marriage when trouble came the first wedding never performed was by God himself so this is his institution and we want to do it God's way not only to honor God but to achieve that balance that is so vitally important the scripture says what God has joined together let not man put us under well man has and is doing everything in his power to dissolve the institution of marriage by changing the meaning of it by changing whom it is too by putting Escape Clauses in marriage by marri marrying on conditions people enter into marriage preparing for the worst but it is only acknowledging that God is not the centerpiece of their life today this marriage is being performed in the name of Jesus Christ not as a matter of tradition but because we believe that what we do in his name will last it's not a lip service it's not a flippant acknowledging of of a God that we do not honor with our lives but as the one who is the glue in our lives the one who makes everything run right even when things go wrong For Better or For Worse is not just a phrase it is acknowledging that God is the centerpiece of this marriage for richer for poor is not a phrase is acknowledging that material things is not the means by which we are happy happiness does not consist of how much of the world's Goods you own but how contented you make yourself with the portion that is a lotted to you and it is because we have Christ as a center of this home he is your life and today your life is changing it is changing dramatically but it's changing for the good not that life wasn't good before but now your life is expanding and that's God's will is God's will that two walk together in agreement and the harmony that he designed it is important that we not let the cult of this age intrude on this harmony this age you see is designed to break up God's Harmony in marriage that's why the majority of marriages do not last in this age because people enter to marriage selfishly instead of before God but when God has joined two together let no man put us under for it is a love an eternal love that comes from God you know we live in times that are constant with constant challenges and and marriage is not to be an escape from the world but it is indeed a commitment to Greater service to the World by demonstrating to a Fallen World the power of the Gospel we live in a world of trouble world of strife and sorrow and pain and there's drunkenness and drugs that are pre prent and infidelities and anger issues that can overwhelm and destroy a home and wreck a marriage however even in this wicked and evil age know for a certain someone will overcome and Jesus spoke of the end time like as it was in the days of Noah when men's hearts on evil continually and because of this there would be marriage and given in marriage by divorce and remarriage but what is joined together before God and the Holy Angels should never be put aunder by any man or woman our behavior and our attitude toward each other should not result in dissolving the holy Union but it should it should result in bringing two together with life lives that are surrendered to God but unfortunately so many unions are dissolved because men and women fail to keep that sacred the the holy Union that God makes between a man and a woman and God is pushed from his place of preeminence by our own stubbornness and selfishness Silas and Lily you have found in each other life's companion the one that you will this journey with the rest of your life on this journey you will share joy and heartache together you will share secrets but not have secrets your life will be Fuller now because you're becoming one with each other it is a lifetime of commitment a road that'll take you to many places and he's PL is one where memories will be made it is because of our Lord Jesus Christ that we realize that no matter what life throws at us we're both committed to him he can turn what's bad into good and make good even better the joy of this day is not just the joining together of you both but the complete Joy is knowing that because the Lord Jesus is the centerpiece of this m marriage it's Eternal it's important to understand that there's only one way to approach marriage and that's God's way in 1 Peter 3 we are told to dwell together as husband and wife and that if you fail to accept God's given roles that God places you in that even your prayers can be hindered you see he is the answer and will be the answer and will be the solution to everything you will face in life that's why we do this in his name Silas and Lily you stand before us today as the children of God Redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ is it your purpose to establish a home that is truly Christ centered where the word of God is read and obeyed a home that is welded together by prayer in which the holy spirit is your constant guide Silas Lily has given you one of the most sacred things under Heaven a woman's life and a woman's love you may bring her great sorrow or cause her great joy it's not what you bring her in a material way that will be through happiness rich is without love or nothing the gift with without the giver is be and the practice of those virtues as a husband that you've shown as her lover will keep her heart one to you you are to be true and loyal Faith patient in sickness comforting in sorrow and forsaken all others keep yourself only to her so both as you shall live do you so promise yes Lily this man Silas is to be your husband on your life and your love and devotion he will
