[1:03:03] nothing
[1:03:04] except my father shows me first
[1:03:07] we are sons of god and mirroring that
[1:03:09] sonship this morning we realize our need
[1:03:12] of jesus

[1:03:32] even if our sins our senses
[1:03:36] did not declare it our faith says the
[1:03:39] word is true
[1:03:41] and we claim the word of promise today
[1:03:44] for deliverance in the mighty name of
[1:03:46] jesus
[1:03:47] and it matters not how great the storm
[1:03:50] we rejoice in the storm
[1:03:53] because we know that it's in the storm
[1:03:56] that jesus
[1:03:57] who is in our boat steps forth on the
[1:03:59] brow
[1:04:01] and it's he that then takes control of
[1:04:03] situations
[1:04:04] and changes them may the jesus inside of
[1:04:08] us
[1:04:09] that's in our boat today rise to the
[1:04:11] challenges of this moment

[1:04:17] but oh god we will have complete and
[1:04:20] total victory
[1:04:22] we know lord that right here on the
[1:04:25] other side is

[1:04:33] land
[1:04:34] there was a legion who demons were cast
[1:04:38] out and thrown into the pigs and the
[1:04:39] pigs drowned
[1:04:41] it's a day lord of the casting down of
[1:04:45] satan
[1:04:46] it's the day of the horizons of the sons
[1:04:49] of god
[1:04:50] it's more than just a season that we've

[1:07:01] brought him through that and we want to
[1:07:02] thank the lord that's
[1:07:04] uh twice here in the last little bit the
[1:07:06] devil's tried to do something to
[1:07:08] one of our people like that but we're
[1:07:11] claiming on the word of promise
[1:07:13] that no weapon no weapon
[1:07:17] formed against is going to prosper amen
[1:07:20] good to see you brother and sister

[1:07:31] amen that was wonderful
[1:07:33] it ministered to me amen how many likes
[1:07:36] to see young people serve god
[1:07:38] i'll tell you it blesses my heart too i
[1:07:42] want to thank everyone for your prayers
[1:07:44] um
[1:07:45] we have sister karen in church with us
[1:07:48] today she was dismissed
[1:07:49] from the hospital as you know on
[1:07:51] wednesday
[1:07:52] and we returned home and the hospital
[1:07:57] called wanting us to return because one
[1:08:00] of the tests showed a
[1:08:02] mass in her heart and you know we had
[1:08:05] that wonderful
[1:08:06] service on wednesday where brother
[1:08:08] timothy priest and
[1:08:09] we anointed her with oil and the saints
[1:08:11] here gathered around and prayed and the
[1:08:14] church prayed and
[1:08:15] i took her to the hospital on thursday
[1:08:17] and i did a heart echo
[1:08:19] i was run on her that was so sure you
[1:08:22] know that they they were gonna have to
[1:08:24] do something
[1:08:25] uh and they kept to so they actually
[1:08:27] admitted her in the hospital because
[1:08:29] we you know we're just so sure of what
[1:08:32] we've already seen but we're gonna run
[1:08:33] this
[1:08:34] heart echo and and um well that evening
[1:08:37] they had to release us let us go home
[1:08:39] because they saw no sign of anything
[1:08:42] amen
[1:08:49] we we believe that god has answered
[1:08:51] prayer
[1:08:52] and amen and that he that started the
[1:08:54] work is going to finish that work
[1:08:57] amen so she's dealt with a little bit
[1:09:00] of confusion and and so on like that
[1:09:03] we're not sure of all
[1:09:05] the issues but it really matters not
[1:09:08] what devil we call it
[1:09:09] we know who is the lord the redeemer
[1:09:12] amen now sometimes we only mention a few
[1:09:16] of those that have been healed by the
[1:09:18] power of god and
[1:09:19] and uh so we commonly uh speak about
[1:09:23] sister lana
[1:09:24] healed from cancer and by the way she
[1:09:26] just went back
[1:09:27] for another doctor's report and and
[1:09:30] uh she had perfect blood work said don't
[1:09:33] come back for a year so she went from
[1:09:35] six months check up to a year and
[1:09:37] so god's continuing that victory and her
[1:09:40] life
[1:09:40] and we want to thank god for that it was
[1:09:43] an absolute
[1:09:44] miracle the doctors themselves said the
[1:09:46] the
[1:09:47] medicine itself would kill her but um
[1:09:50] you know
[1:09:51] we we serve a god who answers prayer
[1:09:54] and uh so we also speak about sister
[1:09:57] mariah
[1:09:58] who was healed of alopecia and it was an
[1:10:01] incurable um disease there that took
[1:10:05] away her hair and
[1:10:06] we saw god come on the scene for that we
[1:10:09] had drew that
[1:10:10] could not walk and when the angel of god
[1:10:13] swept into my
[1:10:14] house uh healing my wife and restoring
[1:10:17] her
[1:10:18] eyesight um there after
[1:10:21] a major brain bleed back in 2015
[1:10:25] you know we we so we've seen so many
[1:10:28] things that god has done
[1:10:30] and there's been many many others that
[1:10:32] have been healed by the power of god
[1:10:35] and you know we have the dunn family
[1:10:37] that has been coming to church
[1:10:40] uh you know when some quit during covet
[1:10:42] and god raised up some to take their
[1:10:44] place
[1:10:45] so they come and um they're here in the
[1:10:48] service we baptized them
[1:10:50] and you know when um his mother
[1:10:53] uh when the little sister shasta got
[1:10:56] saved
[1:10:57] you know she something about it just
[1:11:00] raises your faith to the
[1:11:02] level of the promised lord if you can
[1:11:04] save me from sin you can also heal
[1:11:06] diseases
[1:11:07] and little luke there was born with a
[1:11:09] hundred percent hearing loss
[1:11:11] can only hear by hearing aid bone
[1:11:13] conduction
[1:11:14] and when his mother got saved newborn
[1:11:17] christian laid her hand on her child in
[1:11:19] the service
[1:11:21] and uh that week as they were
[1:11:24] around after the that service the child
[1:11:27] just
[1:11:28] took off his hearing aid and said mama i
[1:11:29] don't need this anymore i can hear good
[1:11:31] without it
[1:11:32] amen so she he has been healed of his
[1:11:36] and that's now marks a year and he still
[1:11:39] don't have to wear a hearing aid
[1:11:41] amen so you know he's still healed today
[1:11:44] his brother gary stanky was dying in the
[1:11:46] hospital that god
[1:11:48] miraculously raised up from a
[1:11:51] death condition there brother ron
[1:11:53] spencer we mentioned who
[1:11:55] the lord sent us to his bedside where he
[1:11:57] lay brain dead
[1:11:59] and they were about to harvest his
[1:12:01] organs and god raised him back to health
[1:12:04] again
[1:12:05] how many testimonies could we tell of
[1:12:07] brother kenneth and
[1:12:08] amanda's that that god has over and over
[1:12:12] brought deliverance to and uh little
[1:12:15] judah oglesby was born with uh
[1:12:17] dysfunctional kidneys that god totally
[1:12:19] healed and restored and
[1:12:21] brother david dexter who had a horrible
[1:12:23] eye disease and
[1:12:25] god totally healed and so you know
[1:12:27] there's just been
[1:12:28] many many things it's not just one or
[1:12:30] two that we mention
[1:12:32] but there is a merit in fact to the
[1:12:35] matter i just
[1:12:36] want to want to just ask today
[1:12:39] how many here that you know that
[1:12:42] god's healing power has worked in your
[1:12:45] life
[1:12:45] and you've been healed by the mighty
[1:12:47] power of god maybe not today or this
[1:12:49] year

[1:12:52] you have been
[1:12:53] healed by the mighty power of god i want
[1:12:55] you to stand to your feet
[1:13:02] now take that devil take that devil

[1:13:21] talk about the salvation of souls
[1:13:24] and the importance of building up and
[1:13:25] adding to the experience of our young
[1:13:27] people
[1:13:28] amen i think uh you know they they are a
[1:13:32] great asset to our church
[1:13:34] and we have some real spirit-filled
[1:13:36] believers
[1:13:37] that um are in our young people group
[1:13:40] that we're so thankful to the lord far
[1:13:44] um you know i i got compliments

[1:21:58] that greater is he that is in us
[1:22:01] than he that is in the world i'm not
[1:22:04] here to lose the battle i'm here to win
[1:22:06] a battle
[1:22:07] and i'm here to battle i'll tell you
[1:22:09] that amen
[1:22:11] revelation chapter 12 verse 7 and there
[1:22:14] was war in heaven
[1:22:16] michael and his angels fought in the
[1:22:17] dragon and
[1:22:19] against the dragon that the dragon
[1:22:21] fought and his angels
[1:22:22] and prevailed not neither was their
[1:22:26] place found
[1:22:27] any more in heaven and the great dragon
[1:22:30] was cast out that old serpent called the
[1:22:33] devil in
[1:22:33] satan which deceived the whole world he
[1:22:36] was cast out into the earth and his
[1:22:38] angels were cast out with him and i
[1:22:40] heard a loud voice
[1:22:42] saying in heaven now is come salvation
[1:22:45] and strength in the kingdom of our god
[1:22:48] and the power of his christ for the
[1:22:50] accuser
[1:22:51] of our brethren is cast down which
[1:22:53] accused them
[1:22:55] before our god day and night and they
[1:22:57] overcame them by the blood the lamb and
[1:22:59] by the word of their testimony and they
[1:23:01] loved not their lives and to the death
[1:23:03] therefore rejoicing heavens and ye that
[1:23:06] dwell in them and woe to the inhabiters
[1:23:08] of the earth
[1:23:09] and of the sea for the devil has come
[1:23:11] down unto you
[1:23:12] having a great wrath because he knoweth
[1:23:15] he hath but a short
[1:23:16] time amen and sister abigail i didn't
[1:23:21] put this in my
[1:23:22] notes this morning but daniel chapter 12
[1:23:25] and verse 1 i just feel like
[1:23:27] reading that down through verse 4 so
[1:23:29] keep up with me
[1:23:30] and at that time shall michael stand up
[1:23:33] the great
[1:23:34] prince was standing for the children of
[1:23:35] thy people and there shall be a time of
[1:23:38] trouble like we're in such as never
[1:23:42] was since there was a nation
[1:23:45] even to that same time and at that time
[1:23:47] that people shall be delivered
[1:23:49] every one that shall be found written in
[1:23:52] the book
[1:23:54] and many of them that sleep in the dust
[1:23:56] of the earth shall await some to
[1:23:58] everlasting life and some to shame and
[1:24:00] everlasting contempt
[1:24:02] and they that be wise shall shine as the
[1:24:07] brightness of the firmament
[1:24:08] and they that turn many to righteousness
[1:24:12] as the stars forever and ever
[1:24:16] but thou daniel set up the words and the
[1:24:18] book
[1:24:19] and seal the book even to the time of
[1:24:21] the end many shall run to and fro
[1:24:24] and knowledge shall be increased and god
[1:24:27] bless you as you have your seats
[1:24:30] looking here in this in this scripture
[1:24:33] today
[1:24:34] taking these thoughts in mind we're
[1:24:36] going to be speaking here from
[1:24:39] um as we speak on the people of the book
[1:24:42] because we are that people of the book
[1:24:45] and the book has been
[1:24:46] opened by the lamb today and it brings
[1:24:48] us our inheritance
[1:24:50] but when we speak it on the battle in
[1:24:52] two
[1:24:53] worlds the battle in two
[1:24:56] worlds we're going to be talking about
[1:24:57] those two worlds
[1:24:59] here um as we um identify them
[1:25:02] and speak about them and if you notice
[1:25:05] that there
[1:25:06] in our scripture reading there was a
[1:25:08] battle that was
[1:25:10] happening in the heavens but then daniel
[1:25:12] tells us that there was
[1:25:14] trouble on the earth so you know
[1:25:18] again heaven's battles reach down to
[1:25:21] earth
[1:25:21] and affects us where we are here upon
[1:25:24] the earth
[1:25:25] now so there are two worlds a natural
[1:25:28] world that we live in physically
[1:25:30] and a supernatural world
[1:25:33] now adam was a dual-natured individual
[1:25:36] he was
[1:25:37] made to live in two worlds at the same
[1:25:40] time
[1:25:42] animals were created with a body and a
[1:25:45] spirit but
[1:25:46] adam was created in the image of god and
[1:25:48] he had
[1:25:49] an extra part he had a body of spirit
[1:25:51] and a soul
[1:25:53] and so he was a triune being and his
[1:25:55] soul realm
[1:25:56] allowed him to be in heaven while he was
[1:25:59] here on the earth
[1:26:01] and he ruled on the earth not with
[1:26:04] earthly contact of see taste smell
[1:26:06] filling here
[1:26:08] but he ruled with authority from
[1:26:11] heaven's realm and he brought
[1:26:14] heaven's atmosphere down to earth
[1:26:18] this made the garden in which he lived
[1:26:21] an eden it made it a true garden instead
[1:26:23] of a
[1:26:24] howling wilderness even even now that's
[1:26:27] the way sons of god are to rule is
[1:26:30] by the word and with the word
[1:26:33] take preeminence over atmospheres
[1:26:37] now um the battle of course as you know
[1:26:41] is over preeminence we've took a couple
[1:26:44] of times on that
[1:26:45] and and it is over your position
[1:26:49] of sonship and it is a battle
[1:26:53] amen i showed you last sunday and i'm
[1:26:56] going to review just a moment
[1:26:57] but show you last sunday when adam fell
[1:27:00] that satan took
[1:27:01] lordship over man and became the accuser
[1:27:05] of the brethren
[1:27:06] and he was and of course he will even
[1:27:10] accuse you
[1:27:11] in heaven before god and contesting your
[1:27:15] rights
[1:27:16] to your position to sit with christ in
[1:27:19] dominion
[1:27:20] so he's doing everything for for to get
[1:27:23] you to
[1:27:24] keep you from taking dominion taking
[1:27:27] authority
[1:27:28] using your authority of sonship amen
[1:27:32] now as um as we looked in the book of
[1:27:35] job and
[1:27:36] job one and six shows us that when the
[1:27:38] sons of god
[1:27:39] appear before god that satan appears
[1:27:42] with them accusing and also he does it
[1:27:46] to exercise his
[1:27:49] in contrast um you know their rights as
[1:27:53] sons to stand there
[1:27:54] so he's standing there with them and
[1:27:57] accusing them
[1:27:59] contesting their rights of their
[1:28:01] righteousness toward god
[1:28:03] and they're standing with with god are
[1:28:06] you with me
[1:28:07] and so then we know as a tormentor
[1:28:10] he walks to and fro as the bible says in
[1:28:13] the next verse
[1:28:14] abigail that um that he he's going to
[1:28:17] and fro in the earth
[1:28:19] from walking up and down it and so as a
[1:28:21] tormentor he
[1:28:22] walks to and fro and stirs up strife and
[1:28:25] nations
[1:28:27] strife and families strife in the
[1:28:30] weather with typhoons and floods and
[1:28:32] hurricanes and
[1:28:33] destruction of every kind insurance
[1:28:36] wants to call that an act of god god
[1:28:38] didn't do that
[1:28:40] it come because of the fall now
[1:28:43] na the nature that adam wants control
[1:28:46] which was uh even the weather as adam
[1:28:50] was brother branham would demonstrate he
[1:28:52] he would say
[1:28:53] to uh he would say oh that breeze is
[1:28:57] kind of cool there adam and he said
[1:28:59] peace be still and
[1:29:00] you know he controlled he controlled the
[1:29:03] whole
[1:29:04] garden there by the word of god right
[1:29:07] amen but now when when sin entered in
[1:29:11] um you know that the nature that
[1:29:14] adam wants control now begins to control
[1:29:18] his thoughts
[1:29:19] what is what you ask everybody every day
[1:29:22] you know
[1:29:22] a hot day isn't it you know how's the
[1:29:25] weather there
[1:29:26] you know all everybody talks about
[1:29:28] weather right
[1:29:30] amen well at least in louisiana you do
[1:29:32] because
[1:29:33] you know you're either freezing or
[1:29:34] burning so anyway
[1:29:36] and you know nature that wants control
[1:29:39] now
[1:29:39] controls his thoughts it torches
[1:29:43] efforts it freezes and burns and
[1:29:46] brings torments of famine and and every
[1:29:49] kind of destruction
[1:29:51] and so all of this happens under satanic
[1:29:55] lordship over mankind and his earthly
[1:29:58] home
[1:29:59] now in the we we also saw in the book of
[1:30:02] zechariah that that joshua the high
[1:30:05] priest
[1:30:06] appeared before god this is three and
[1:30:08] one um
[1:30:09] and satan is at his right hand to oppose
[1:30:12] him
[1:30:13] or to resist him so he is there
[1:30:16] as a tormentor resisting
[1:30:20] are you with me so this is his job as a
[1:30:23] tormentor to
[1:30:24] resist you every time that you step into
[1:30:27] god's presence
[1:30:29] every time you go to make an appeal
[1:30:31] before the throne
[1:30:32] satan is there resisting bringing every
[1:30:36] thought
[1:30:37] every kind of accusation come on
[1:30:40] telling you your unworthiness i mean it
[1:30:43] begins a battle
[1:30:45] the moment you go to prayer the washing
[1:30:47] comes to mind and
[1:30:49] something has to be done and the yard's
[1:30:51] got to be mowed and
[1:30:52] you know your busyness of life and you
[1:30:54] know everything you sit in church
[1:30:56] and you think well i'm in church and now
[1:30:59] there's no battle no battle
[1:31:00] the church is a battleground you're
[1:31:03] going to battle to keep your thoughts on
[1:31:05] god
[1:31:06] amen you're going to battle to to to
[1:31:09] press through your
[1:31:10] heaviness through the darkness through
[1:31:12] your feelings
[1:31:14] you're going to battle every service is
[1:31:17] a
[1:31:17] battle amen and so you know
[1:31:20] we found that jesus was no exception
[1:31:24] as the first one filled with the spirit
[1:31:26] whom the spirit would
[1:31:27] really indwell and and not simply anoint
[1:31:30] but in 12
[1:31:31] jesus having received his position of
[1:31:34] sonship when heaven opened and and the
[1:31:38] dove came down and
[1:31:39] the bar one the spirit like a dub came
[1:31:42] down and
[1:31:43] and here he god's voice spoke out and
[1:31:47] told him he said this you are the son i
[1:31:49] love
[1:31:51] you're the son i love you remember this
[1:31:54] is exactly the same thing happens
[1:31:56] when anyone gets filled with the holy
[1:31:57] ghost
[1:31:59] it is when heaven opens and the holy
[1:32:01] spirit comes down
[1:32:03] and he says you're my son you're my
[1:32:06] daughter
[1:32:06] and god puts a claim on your life are
[1:32:09] you with me
[1:32:10] amen but then the tempter came in
[1:32:13] matthew 4 3
[1:32:14] and it tempts him comes and accuses him
[1:32:18] the first thing that he does after
[1:32:20] receiving the spirit of god and that
[1:32:22] great anointing came upon him
[1:32:25] to live in him he said when the tempter
[1:32:27] came to him he said
[1:32:28] if thou be the son of god
[1:32:32] always questioning authority
[1:32:35] always try to trying to talk you out of
[1:32:39] your dominion
[1:32:41] you're trying to get you to lay your
[1:32:43] weapon down
[1:32:45] you have the word come on but if you if
[1:32:48] if satan can get you to disbelieve your
[1:32:51] weapon he's got you disarmed
[1:32:54] amen you've got to stand there with the
[1:32:56] word what
[1:32:57] god said i am not how i feel today
[1:33:00] now how not how human i felt and how
[1:33:03] human i've acted
[1:33:05] but who i am what he said i am i
[1:33:08] am who i am because the i am said i am
[1:33:13] now so you see again jesus had to fight
[1:33:16] with satan in order to
[1:33:17] operate as a son from the heavenly realm
[1:33:20] it was
[1:33:20] well his position was questioned and
[1:33:24] although he was the son of god his his
[1:33:26] dominion
[1:33:28] only was in recognizing who he
[1:33:31] was and operating as a son of god
[1:33:35] with power and authority uh from his
[1:33:38] position of sonship in the heavenlies
[1:33:42] notice it was heaven gave him that
[1:33:44] position
[1:33:45] he didn't have that position necessarily
[1:33:47] on earth with earthly governments
[1:33:50] rome didn't recognize that come on even
[1:33:53] the
[1:33:54] even the pharisees sadducees that the
[1:33:56] jews the herodians none of them
[1:33:58] recognized that
[1:33:59] he wasn't recognized at the temple but
[1:34:02] in heaven
[1:34:03] he was recognized as the son of god
[1:34:07] and heaven there because of that he had
[1:34:11] a representation in heaven
[1:34:14] were that he was ruling there and would
[1:34:16] take over
[1:34:17] that take dominion over satan and his
[1:34:21] powers
[1:34:21] right here on the earth
[1:34:25] now again
[1:34:28] the battle was over would god's word
[1:34:30] have preeminence
[1:34:32] or would satan's doubt have preeminence
[1:34:35] and that's where the battle is today
[1:34:37] by the lines are drawn which one's going
[1:34:39] to have preemptions
[1:34:41] now jesus known his position he cast out
[1:34:45] devils by the authority of his sonship
[1:34:47] he took the position in the word he
[1:34:49] healed the sick by the authority of his
[1:34:51] sonship
[1:34:52] he literally brought heaven's rule to
[1:34:54] the earth
[1:34:55] is that right he did not go like a
[1:34:58] doctor would and do a
[1:35:00] surgery on a man and remove a tumor he
[1:35:03] spoke to it and it left
[1:35:06] is that right he he commanded the light
[1:35:08] to come out of the devil
[1:35:10] in there jesus didn't jesus didn't deal
[1:35:14] in in the flesh realm he was dealing in
[1:35:17] the spirit realm
[1:35:19] and i want you to understand that's
[1:35:20] where your battle is it's not in the
[1:35:22] flesh realm
[1:35:23] it's in the spirit realm now so
[1:35:26] jesus know in his position cast out
[1:35:29] devils
[1:35:30] brought heaven's rule to the earth and
[1:35:33] in matthew 4
[1:35:34] 23 he went about all galilee teaching in
[1:35:37] their synagogue preaching the gospel of
[1:35:38] the kingdom
[1:35:39] healing all manner of sickness and
[1:35:43] manner all manner of diseases among
[1:35:45] people
[1:35:46] among the people let me tell you again
[1:35:49] we got a lot of teachers in the land
[1:35:51] today but very few preachers
[1:35:53] to preach the gospel is to bring
[1:35:56] deliverance and with that comes healing
[1:35:59] of sickness
[1:36:00] and all manner of diseases and if that
[1:36:03] ain't happening
[1:36:04] then i'll tell you you're not here and
[1:36:06] preaching
[1:36:07] you're here in exhortations of teaching
[1:36:12] now i mean well we teach doctrine listen
[1:36:15] jesus
[1:36:16] doctrine what's different from the
[1:36:18] pharisees doctrine
[1:36:19] is that that demons heard his word and
[1:36:22] had to obey him
[1:36:24] never heard we a man speak like this man
[1:36:27] amen so real preaching there cast satan
[1:36:30] out
[1:36:31] i'm expecting into every service that i
[1:36:34] preach
[1:36:34] for demons to lead people doubt and fear
[1:36:38] and unbelief about even false doctrines
[1:36:42] and things that have tried to hold on to
[1:36:43] you
[1:36:44] so that and so the revelation come and
[1:36:46] strike your heart
[1:36:47] amen because with the preaching the word
[1:36:49] comes the casting out of satan
[1:36:52] i have been anointed as a preacher of
[1:36:54] the gospel to
[1:36:55] to cast satan's kingdom down
[1:36:59] we're tearing it down little by little
[1:37:03] break my breath stone by but we are
[1:37:06] overcoming
[1:37:08] we'll take another stone or another wall
[1:37:10] or another piece of oil but it's all
[1:37:12] coming down
[1:37:14] satan has no right to us amen now in
[1:37:17] luke chapter 10 we see jesus
[1:37:19] authorized 70 to act by the authority of
[1:37:22] his position by acting in his name so
[1:37:25] you know
[1:37:26] these people weren't even yet saved
[1:37:29] the holy ghost should not even come but
[1:37:31] they could actually act in the authority
[1:37:33] of jesus name
[1:37:36] amen just realizing that jesus had paid
[1:37:39] the price
[1:37:40] or that he had given them that authority
[1:37:43] amen and with his authority using his
[1:37:46] name
[1:37:47] they took dominion over devils now i
[1:37:50] want you to notice this is
[1:37:52] this is uh where he said in in verse
[1:37:55] luke 10 17 and the 70 re
[1:37:59] returning again with joy saying lord
[1:38:02] even
[1:38:02] devils are subject unto us through thy
[1:38:05] name
[1:38:06] amen verse 18 and he said unto them
[1:38:09] i beheld as satan
[1:38:12] as lightning falls from heaven
[1:38:16] notice they went out to to preach
[1:38:20] the gospel to cast out devils this is
[1:38:22] what he commits them to
[1:38:24] and here they come back and said we've
[1:38:26] done the job
[1:38:28] we saw the devil cast out and they're
[1:38:31] rejoicing about it
[1:38:33] and he said unto them he said i saw
[1:38:37] satan as lightning fall from heaven
[1:38:41] so when believers take their position
[1:38:46] amen when they take even the authority
[1:38:48] of jesus name
[1:38:50] and begin to operate in that authority
[1:38:54] hallelujah amen these were not even holy
[1:38:56] ghost
[1:38:57] field ones yet the day of pentecost
[1:38:59] didn't come
[1:39:01] but they believed what jesus told them
[1:39:03] if i can get you to believe
[1:39:06] nothing will stand before our prayers
[1:39:08] not even cancer that's what the angel
[1:39:11] told us
[1:39:12] that's what he told the prophet of god
[1:39:14] come on amen if
[1:39:16] the people start believing
[1:39:19] hallelujah i don't care you might have
[1:39:21] been just a newborn christian
[1:39:24] just got saved just like sister shasta
[1:39:28] amen but you got this much right and
[1:39:30] authority
[1:39:31] to lay your hands on your death child or
[1:39:34] any other problem and command the devil
[1:39:36] to go
[1:39:38] hallelujah it don't take a long history
[1:39:41] of serving god
[1:39:42] it takes one moment of believing
[1:39:45] i'll tell you why you're believing amen
[1:39:48] don't stop delivering devils defeated
[1:39:50] [Applause]
[1:39:51] hallelujah take a hold of it that same
[1:39:55] god that healed you of one thing
[1:39:56] heal your son luke of a death problem
[1:40:00] will take away
[1:40:01] bipolar conditions or any kind of
[1:40:03] depression
[1:40:04] or even the the wickedness of your past
[1:40:07] make you white as snow
[1:40:08] but you've got to believe what god's
[1:40:10] word said and you've got to realize
[1:40:12] this is what he said about me hallelujah
[1:40:15] that though my sins were escarted
[1:40:17] they're not white as snow
[1:40:19] though they were red like crimson
[1:40:20] they're white light wool
[1:40:24] as far as jesus from the west i've
[1:40:26] removed your sins from you
[1:40:30] so yeah jesus said i saw a great
[1:40:34] a great battle in the spirit he says
[1:40:36] behold i give you
[1:40:37] power
[1:40:42] verse 19. i give you power to tread on
[1:40:45] serpents and scorpions
[1:40:47] and over all the power of the enemy and
[1:40:49] nothing
[1:40:50] somebody say nothing amen whatever
[1:40:53] you're going through
[1:40:55] put the name there it's nothing
[1:41:00] did somebody hear that it's nothing
[1:41:04] nothing shall by any means hurt you
[1:41:10] am i but this is war turn with me to
[1:41:12] ephesians 6
[1:41:13] 11 put on the whole armor of god what
[1:41:16] why in the world is he dressing you up
[1:41:17] like a
[1:41:18] soldier and you're not going to fight
[1:41:22] he didn't say no i'm making you a
[1:41:23] christian and you're going on a picnic
[1:41:25] and i've given you this land and you're
[1:41:27] just going to go in there and enjoy the
[1:41:29] benefits of it no he said you're going
[1:41:31] to go in there and you're going to chase
[1:41:32] out the enemy
[1:41:35] hallelujah god gave you healing but
[1:41:37] you're going to chase out the enemy
[1:41:40] god gave you salvation but you're going
[1:41:42] to chase out the enemy
[1:41:44] amen you're going to you're going to
[1:41:46] you're going to bind together you're
[1:41:47] going to believe together you're going
[1:41:48] to pray
[1:41:50] you're going to expect you're going to
[1:41:51] put faith to work
[1:41:53] you're going to take the sword in the
[1:41:54] hand of faith
[1:41:57] because unbelief won't hold the sword
[1:42:00] it'll drop it every time now so you got
[1:42:03] to dress for war
[1:42:05] you put on the full armor of god that's
[1:42:07] his precepts
[1:42:08] they're like the armor of a heavily
[1:42:11] armed soldier
[1:42:14] so that you may be able to successfully
[1:42:17] stand up not just stand up
[1:42:19] successfully stand up did you read what
[1:42:23] i read
[1:42:24] in revelations 12 that lucifer fought
[1:42:28] and prevailed not
[1:42:31] that shouting ground's for you today
[1:42:33] he's not going to win
[1:42:37] you're going to come out of this
[1:42:38] victorious
[1:42:40] amen satan is already prophesied in the
[1:42:43] scripture to be defeated you're
[1:42:45] are dealing with an already defeated
[1:42:47] enemy
[1:42:48] [Applause]
[1:42:50] hallelujah and i'm giving him some
[1:42:52] depression this morning
[1:42:54] amen and i'm reminding him that his
[1:42:56] limbs are the lake of fire
[1:43:00] hallelujah but i've reminded him that i
[1:43:03] will never
[1:43:03] end because i never did begin
[1:43:07] i was in his thoughts and eternal
[1:43:09] thoughts of god before the foundational
[1:43:11] world
[1:43:11] and i'm not a temporary being when he's
[1:43:14] gone i'll still be here
[1:43:17] whatever devil is burning in hell i'll
[1:43:19] still be shouting the victory
[1:43:26] now so you can stand up against all the
[1:43:29] schemes and the strategies and deceits
[1:43:31] of the devil
[1:43:32] verse 12 we wrestle not against flesh
[1:43:34] and blood
[1:43:36] but against principalities
[1:43:39] principalities
[1:43:41] these are wicked devils these are ruling
[1:43:44] devils
[1:43:46] these are these are governments
[1:43:49] satanic governments against
[1:43:53] powers against rulers yes
[1:43:57] we're not just against the peon soldiers
[1:44:00] of
[1:44:00] the devils we're against rulers
[1:44:05] of the darkness of this world
[1:44:08] against spiritual wickedness
[1:44:12] in high places now i want to remind you
[1:44:16] when you read high places there that's
[1:44:18] heavenly places
[1:44:20] exact same word that is spilled that
[1:44:23] spoke up in
[1:44:24] ephesians chapter one that he has met uh
[1:44:26] that made us to sit together with him in
[1:44:28] heavenly places
[1:44:30] so our battle is for heavenly places
[1:44:34] and so it's a battle in and not just
[1:44:37] this world but another world also
[1:44:41] and that's what you're seeing and and
[1:44:43] and daniel you know when
[1:44:44] when that when there he the book of
[1:44:47] daniel when
[1:44:48] gabriel tells i would have been here
[1:44:52] you've been praying for three weeks and
[1:44:54] i'd have been here the first day you
[1:44:55] called
[1:44:56] but i was opposed by the prince of
[1:44:59] persia
[1:45:01] and i had to battle it out and i would
[1:45:03] still be battling if i hadn't called for
[1:45:05] michael to come help me
[1:45:08] angelic battles in heavenly places
[1:45:12] affecting things happening on earth
[1:45:17] and daniel's having to persevere
[1:45:19] daniel's having to pray harder
[1:45:21] daniel can't give up come on
[1:45:25] if he gives up the angel never comes
[1:45:28] because what happens in the heaven
[1:45:31] depends on your reaction on earth
[1:45:34] you start doubting the angel can't come
[1:45:36] to you he cannot respond to your doubt
[1:45:40] he can only respond to your faith
[1:45:44] [Music]
[1:45:49] now here's a translation
[1:45:52] that paraphrases this verse god is
[1:45:55] strong
[1:45:56] and he wants you strong
[1:46:00] amen remember sister karen
[1:46:04] remember what i've been telling you what
[1:46:05] you've been saying
[1:46:07] let the week say
[1:46:11] what i'm strong
[1:46:17] let the week say
[1:46:20] not i'm weak don't confess your weakness
[1:46:24] confess what god said about you let the
[1:46:27] weak said
[1:46:29] i'm strong amen profess what his word
[1:46:32] said about you
[1:46:33] not how you're feeling
[1:46:36] [Music]
[1:46:38] now this as i'm reading this translation
[1:46:41] it's a paraphrase really kind of
[1:46:43] like an amplified but said so take
[1:46:46] everything the master has set up for
[1:46:47] your well-made weapons
[1:46:49] of the best material dress yourself in
[1:46:51] all of it
[1:46:52] and put them to you so you'll be able to
[1:46:54] stand up to everything the devil throws
[1:46:57] your way
[1:46:58] this is no weekend war
[1:47:02] that we'll walk away from and forget
[1:47:03] about in a couple hours
[1:47:06] this is for keeps it's a life
[1:47:09] or death fight to the finish and against
[1:47:12] the devil
[1:47:13] and all his angels
[1:47:19] don't let that pass over your head and
[1:47:22] man
[1:47:22] it's not something you're just going to
[1:47:24] walk away from
[1:47:26] you young people say well i got the holy
[1:47:27] ghost there'll never be a fight no more
[1:47:29] no there's a fight all the way
[1:47:33] amen you say well brother tim i got the
[1:47:35] victory the other day that i'll never
[1:47:36] see that devil let me tell you something
[1:47:38] when david took the head off of goliath
[1:47:40] how many more wars did they have after
[1:47:42] that
[1:47:43] [Applause]
[1:47:45] they defeated the philistines that time
[1:47:47] and chased them out of the land but did
[1:47:49] they come again yes they came again
[1:47:51] will the devil come again yes he'll come
[1:47:53] again
[1:47:55] and then he'll try to confess you can
[1:47:57] convince you
[1:47:58] it didn't really matter that you cut the
[1:48:00] day ahead off of goliath
[1:48:01] it didn't count anyway we're back here
[1:48:03] in bigger numbers
[1:48:08] now so it's a life or death fight to the
[1:48:11] finish
[1:48:14] am i when i when i get through with my
[1:48:17] battle
[1:48:18] when i come down to rapture out
[1:48:21] i want them to have to pry my
[1:48:24] fingers off of the sword of the word of
[1:48:27] god
[1:48:29] before i put it down back down in my
[1:48:31] scabbard
[1:48:32] where i fight no more
[1:48:35] until then i want to fight devils until
[1:48:38] my hand cleans
[1:48:40] it sticks to the sword you can't try it
[1:48:44] off
[1:48:49] now we got to be determined to fight in
[1:48:52] some very deep
[1:48:53] pits
[1:48:59] and you don't know what lays before you
[1:49:02] i have no idea either
[1:49:06] but we got to determine to to fight in
[1:49:09] some very deep
[1:49:10] pits but we're david's mighty men
[1:49:14] come on church banaya the son of
[1:49:17] jehoiada the son of a violet man of
[1:49:19] of cabzille done mighty axe slew two
[1:49:22] lying men
[1:49:23] like me lying like men of moab he went
[1:49:27] down also
[1:49:28] and slew a line in the midst of a pit in
[1:49:31] the time of snow
[1:49:33] he was he was fighting enemies that had
[1:49:36] the advantage over him
[1:49:38] and he had to go down into the pit
[1:49:41] to destroy an enemy and you may have to
[1:49:45] go
[1:49:45] down in a pit to see an enemy destroyed
[1:49:50] brother gary you had to go down in a pit
[1:49:53] a very low place to see an enemy
[1:49:57] destroyed
[1:49:58] but you came out of it amen you came out
[1:50:02] of it
[1:50:04] hallelujah he slew him a a an egyptian a
[1:50:07] goodly man
[1:50:08] and he had a spear in his hand he went
[1:50:10] down with his stuff in his hand
[1:50:12] against the man with his fear and he
[1:50:14] took the spirit away from the egyptian
[1:50:16] and slew him with his own spirit
[1:50:18] i'll tell you sometimes you gotta slay
[1:50:21] the devil with his own words
[1:50:24] [Applause]
[1:50:25] brother branham said when he went to
[1:50:26] pray through for the holy ghost
[1:50:28] he said the devil said you so you've
[1:50:30] already sent away your day of grace he
[1:50:32] said i just used it against him
[1:50:34] and i said oh god then this is my chance
[1:50:37] it's my only
[1:50:38] chance and here here it is if i've
[1:50:40] sinned away
[1:50:41] i'm gonna knock on before over and over
[1:50:44] and over again i'm not giving up
[1:50:45] i must persevere i must have it
[1:50:56] now our battles are not against physical
[1:50:59] people
[1:51:00] we are not fighting against people made
[1:51:02] of flesh and blood
[1:51:04] but against if we call them people
[1:51:06] spirits
[1:51:07] without bodies evil rulers of the unseen
[1:51:12] world
[1:51:13] mighty satanic beings and great evil
[1:51:16] princes of darkness
[1:51:18] who rule this world jesus acknowledged
[1:51:20] they did
[1:51:21] he said to him the prince of this world
[1:51:24] has come
[1:51:24] hath no part in me so he acknowledged
[1:51:28] that he was
[1:51:29] prince of this world and against
[1:51:32] huge numbers of wicked spirits
[1:51:36] in the spirit world so now
[1:51:39] there is a natural world and there is a
[1:51:41] spirit world
[1:51:43] brother branham many times didn't deal
[1:51:46] with
[1:51:46] things in in the natural he was dealing
[1:51:50] with things in the spirit
[1:51:52] you know like the maniac they come and
[1:51:54] run it up and said
[1:51:55] with the young men policeman to come and
[1:51:58] subdue the maniac that had
[1:52:00] come to threaten his life and and going
[1:52:03] to hit him and
[1:52:04] all of that and and they wanted to know
[1:52:06] you know
[1:52:07] can we help and he waved him away he
[1:52:09] said this is not
[1:52:11] a flesh and blood affair
[1:52:15] this is a spiritual battle i'm not
[1:52:18] dealing with the man and the physical
[1:52:20] man i'm dealing with the devil there
[1:52:22] that has
[1:52:23] possessed him now so
[1:52:26] brother adam didn't deal with him in the
[1:52:28] natural means he dealt with him in a
[1:52:30] spiritual me
[1:52:30] the man did everything he could to get
[1:52:32] him in the natural
[1:52:34] get him in the flesh hop down
[1:52:39] spit him in the face trying to make him
[1:52:42] mad
[1:52:43] cursing him calling him ever got a name
[1:52:46] wouldn't that kind of get you in the
[1:52:47] flesh
[1:52:49] amen he was trying to get brother
[1:52:51] branham in the flesh
[1:52:54] amen but he refused to get in the flesh
[1:52:59] and he spoke to the spirit
[1:53:03] in the man now
[1:53:06] you're going to have to understand this
[1:53:09] is not
[1:53:09] physical it's spiritual
[1:53:13] and you you look at your ailment you
[1:53:14] look at your sickness you see the
[1:53:16] problems and you think it's physical it
[1:53:18] isn't physical
[1:53:19] it's spiritual
[1:53:22] you say i i've got a i've got a cataract
[1:53:25] well brother branham
[1:53:26] would take a person in his with his left
[1:53:28] hand and hold in their right hand
[1:53:30] and and there the disease would show
[1:53:33] because it was a germ disease
[1:53:35] oh well science may not say it was a
[1:53:37] germ disease but
[1:53:38] it so happened it reacted on brother
[1:53:40] branham
[1:53:42] oh today they just go and do a cut and
[1:53:44] take a surgery and
[1:53:45] take it out but you know in brother
[1:53:47] bratton's time there was no
[1:53:48] no cure for that medically
[1:53:54] they just want that
[1:54:00] but brother random never did a surgery
[1:54:03] he spoke to the spirit
[1:54:05] and it died
[1:54:11] now watch this as we go in
[1:54:14] when sin entered and darkness
[1:54:19] sin darkened and closed adam's access to
[1:54:22] the throne
[1:54:23] of sonship he's still a man
[1:54:28] he's still a man still he was actually
[1:54:30] more human than ever
[1:54:32] because now he's mortal
[1:54:35] after sin come in he's more human than
[1:54:37] ever
[1:54:39] what'd he do he was separated from his
[1:54:41] sonship
[1:54:44] and his sonship authority now
[1:54:47] what adam did jesus came to restore
[1:54:51] to restore a people back to sonship
[1:54:54] authority
[1:54:56] now man fell from his position not on
[1:54:58] the earth but he still ruled the earth
[1:55:01] but he lost his ability to rule the
[1:55:03] earth and control its atmosphere
[1:55:05] as a sun now
[1:55:08] adam still had human strength and can do
[1:55:12] mighty things with his intellect
[1:55:14] and the sweat of his brow
[1:55:18] look at the things that man accomplishes
[1:55:20] there's a lot of things with the sweat
[1:55:22] of his brow
[1:55:24] but you see that was not the way before
[1:55:26] the fall
[1:55:27] it was by the word that he ruled
[1:55:31] all things as the son of god he spoke
[1:55:34] and it happened he said to a tree
[1:55:37] be plucked up and moved over here how do
[1:55:39] we know that because the second adam
[1:55:40] said we can do it
[1:55:44] is that right amen the second adam said
[1:55:46] we could move a mountain
[1:55:49] the second adam there could have spoke
[1:55:51] to nature
[1:55:52] and made the seas and the winds obey him
[1:55:55] so we know then by that what the first
[1:55:58] adam did
[1:55:59] amen now and then of course the curse
[1:56:01] made him have to do everything by the
[1:56:03] sweat of his brows so we know something
[1:56:05] from that before that
[1:56:06] he didn't have to sweat to do it it
[1:56:09] wasn't with human efforts
[1:56:12] but now we come down to our moment in
[1:56:14] time our battle is not a
[1:56:16] flesh and blood battle it's about
[1:56:18] operating
[1:56:19] from the heavenly realm by the power of
[1:56:22] the word
[1:56:24] now before the fall literally adam
[1:56:27] literally brought heaven down to earth
[1:56:30] even the animals were ruled
[1:56:32] by heaven's atmosphere it was like it
[1:56:35] would be in the millennium the garden
[1:56:37] was like a millennium you know
[1:56:39] the lion lay down with the lamb
[1:56:44] you know any deliverance from sin is by
[1:56:47] bringing heaven's dominion
[1:56:49] over that sin it comes by making satan
[1:56:53] fall from having dominion and the word
[1:56:56] of faith
[1:56:57] empowers a person to rise above sin and
[1:57:00] take
[1:57:01] dominion that's salvation when we talk
[1:57:04] about salvation that means
[1:57:06] we have been given dominion over sin
[1:57:09] sin no longer rules us romans 6
[1:57:12] tells us so we are no longer servants
[1:57:16] of sins sin is now our slave
[1:57:20] we tell it what to do it does not tell
[1:57:22] us what to do
[1:57:27] now it makes a man or a woman
[1:57:31] to rule over evil spirits from their
[1:57:34] throne
[1:57:35] of sonship your relationship
[1:57:38] to god empowers you and makes you a
[1:57:41] ruler
[1:57:44] when you believe you are literally
[1:57:47] casting out devils
[1:57:51] hallelujah you as a child of god you
[1:57:54] live in two worlds as a
[1:57:57] as a child of god you know you're you're
[1:58:00] living two worlds you were born the
[1:58:02] world by your first birth
[1:58:03] but you're born of heaven by your new
[1:58:06] birth
[1:58:08] so we are a people fleshly we got a
[1:58:11] citizenship on the earth
[1:58:12] but heavenly we got a heavenly
[1:58:14] citizenship
[1:58:16] amen we're here still working and doing
[1:58:19] by the sweat of our brow
[1:58:20] but at the same time we're sons of god
[1:58:23] and we are to control
[1:58:25] by bringing heaven's atmosphere down
[1:58:28] into the church
[1:58:29] into our family into our body
[1:58:34] hallelujah this is what your job is to
[1:58:37] do
[1:58:38] your battle is not flesh and blood but
[1:58:40] it's against principalities
[1:58:42] and powers and spiritual wickedness and
[1:58:45] rulers and high places
[1:58:48] amen now when man sinned he lost access
[1:58:52] to being able to live in heavenly places
[1:58:54] he lost his throne he lost his domain
[1:58:58] you know that's what edom eden was it
[1:59:00] was an extension of heaven upon the
[1:59:02] earth
[1:59:02] and that realm god become would be
[1:59:05] visible
[1:59:06] and that realm his voice was plainly
[1:59:08] heard
[1:59:10] amen adam would hear the voice of god
[1:59:12] walking in the cool of the day
[1:59:14] god walked among them is that right
[1:59:19] amen in that realm the word worked
[1:59:22] through his
[1:59:22] lips with creative power
[1:59:26] as he kept the garden he didn't use a
[1:59:29] shovel
[1:59:30] and dig up a tree to move it with the
[1:59:32] sweat of his brow do it
[1:59:34] or get a chainsaw if it was too big and
[1:59:36] cut it up and burn it
[1:59:38] the way he moved it was by the word
[1:59:43] now so adam was a son of god his father
[1:59:47] the almighty he would the almighty god
[1:59:50] with
[1:59:50] faith filled words brought the universe
[1:59:54] into existence
[1:59:56] and adam kept the garden the same way by
[2:00:00] faith filled words
[2:00:03] and i'm just gonna tell you that's the
[2:00:05] only way you'll keep your garden today
[2:00:08] is with faith filled words
[2:00:11] the animals as we said were in perfect
[2:00:13] harmony always controlled by
[2:00:16] heaven's atmosphere the access though to
[2:00:19] to the sense of faith and by sin
[2:00:22] was closed off and and faith was turned
[2:00:26] to
[2:00:26] unbelief remember you're like a magnet
[2:00:30] you've got a pole that on one side that
[2:00:33] pulls
[2:00:33] and the other resists amen when malachi
[2:00:37] 4 came to turn to heart
[2:00:39] you know what our condition was we were
[2:00:41] pulled toward the world
[2:00:43] we were pulled toward creeds we were
[2:00:46] pulled toward the prince of darkness
[2:00:48] we were pulled through spiritual sin
[2:00:50] physical sin
[2:00:51] all kinds of sin but when the word came
[2:00:54] he
[2:00:54] turned our heart amen
[2:00:58] now we push away the world
[2:01:01] and we're pulled toward god
[2:01:05] malachi 4 came to turn you from unbelief
[2:01:09] back to faith again but to do so it had
[2:01:12] to turn the heart
[2:01:14] because our faith remember unbelief is
[2:01:17] just faith
[2:01:18] really aimed in the wrong direction
[2:01:23] you gotta have a lot of faith to believe
[2:01:24] there is no god
[2:01:26] you gotta have a lot of faith to believe
[2:01:29] we came from monkeys
[2:01:31] you gotta have a lot of faith to think
[2:01:32] that two asses rub their
[2:01:34] asses our acids rubbed together and
[2:01:37] with the rubbing of those acids that
[2:01:41] that they're um that they're all sun
[2:01:43] light sprung out of you gotta have a lot
[2:01:45] of faith to believe that
[2:01:48] amen amen but i'll tell you you know it
[2:01:51] takes a lot of faith
[2:01:53] to be an atheist wait a minute let me
[2:01:56] just talk about it they want to talk
[2:01:58] about
[2:01:58] theory about evolution and they're
[2:02:01] preaching that
[2:02:02] in the schools like it's a fact it is
[2:02:05] not about
[2:02:06] it is a theory and it's not even proven
[2:02:09] and you are basing your belief on a lie
[2:02:13] and you have to believe a lie that will
[2:02:15] damn you
[2:02:18] and to disbelieve god is a lie that will
[2:02:21] damn you and to do that you got to turn
[2:02:24] down
[2:02:24] amen you got you can't even look at a
[2:02:26] blade of grass
[2:02:28] without knowing there's a god in heaven
[2:02:30] that would cause it to come into being
[2:02:33] amen you cannot look at the earth in
[2:02:36] this position
[2:02:37] in the earth and know that some ham had
[2:02:40] to put it there
[2:02:42] in perfect order at a perfect place at a
[2:02:44] perfect spot
[2:02:51] when you get down to all your questions
[2:02:54] you look in the blade of grass and okay
[2:02:55] where did that come from and
[2:02:57] how far you know how you're going to
[2:03:00] have to come down to
[2:03:06] in the beginning god
[2:03:11] there's no other answer
[2:03:14] i said there's no other answer
[2:03:22] now when man sinned he was left with
[2:03:25] only
[2:03:26] the five senses to contact the world we
[2:03:28] live in
[2:03:30] modern man knows
[2:03:35] that there are things that i cannot see
[2:03:40] that just a few generations ago was
[2:03:43] totally unknown to man
[2:03:47] by microscopes the
[2:03:50] world the man has discovered a world
[2:03:54] that was previously unknown to man
[2:03:59] and with the scientific achievements of
[2:04:02] the microscope has
[2:04:03] has brought that which was once
[2:04:05] invisible
[2:04:06] and made them visible amen
[2:04:11] but before this it was a world that was
[2:04:14] unknown that's right
[2:04:18] now i i'm telling you you're living in
[2:04:21] word with knowing of worlds today
[2:04:24] that other agents didn't know about
[2:04:30] coming on down for a minute the fourth
[2:04:32] dimension of radio waves
[2:04:34] it's a realm that is real
[2:04:38] how many can see a radio waves out there
[2:04:40] today
[2:04:42] well if i had a radio up here i'd wave
[2:04:45] it for you
[2:04:48] but that'd be the only way you'll see a
[2:04:49] wave radio wave
[2:04:52] moving through this room are invisible
[2:04:55] waves that contain voices that our ears
[2:04:59] cannot hear
[2:05:02] these waves contain also contain
[2:05:04] pictures
[2:05:05] that our eyes cannot see
[2:05:09] not obscure in images but images
[2:05:12] in living color
[2:05:16] voices that are exactly like the voice
[2:05:19] of the one who spoke it
[2:05:23] 200 years ago mankind did not know how
[2:05:25] to
[2:05:26] harness invisible waves uh and the
[2:05:29] invisible energy of electricity
[2:05:32] to think today we think nothing of it
[2:05:35] we plug an appliance into the receptacle
[2:05:37] and you we use
[2:05:38] it's energy to to power them we can't
[2:05:41] see the electricity
[2:05:43] it's invisible to the eye but we can
[2:05:46] feel it
[2:05:48] how many has ever felt electricity oh
[2:05:50] yeah now these modern advances
[2:05:53] has brought the invisible
[2:05:56] and made them visible made
[2:05:59] some things that was intangible and made
[2:06:02] them
[2:06:02] tangible voices that are audio
[2:06:06] audible invisible energies made them
[2:06:09] usable thus we live in a world that
[2:06:12] would have been
[2:06:13] foreign to people of past ages
[2:06:17] but just as real as electricity
[2:06:20] and television and radio there is a
[2:06:23] heaven
[2:06:26] and it is it was just as real to adam
[2:06:29] as the world we now live in
[2:06:35] now although it's invisible you believe
[2:06:38] you're convinced of it we know it
[2:06:40] because we've been born again
[2:06:43] and though our five senses can't
[2:06:45] recognize it
[2:06:47] i can't see electricity i can't see
[2:06:49] radio waves
[2:06:52] amen i can't see a lot of that with
[2:06:55] but i know it's there amen
[2:06:58] also also i know we know that because
[2:07:01] we've been born again though our five
[2:07:03] senses won't declare it amen
[2:07:07] but we know exist by our god-given
[2:07:11] sense of faith
[2:07:14] now so here we're both we're born
[2:07:18] in a fallen body a mortal body that was
[2:07:21] given us by fall
[2:07:22] his eyes are now invisible
[2:07:26] to what adam used to think common
[2:07:30] he saw all the time he saw
[2:07:33] and then heard god walking in the cool
[2:07:36] of the day
[2:07:37] angels ascending descending oh
[2:07:40] the heaven and its atmosphere and he
[2:07:43] could bring it down to the earth
[2:07:46] but now we're because of the fall there
[2:07:49] that we we are we were made subject now
[2:07:52] just to
[2:07:53] five senses what we can see what we can
[2:07:56] taste what we can feel what we can hear
[2:07:59] now so again you you know
[2:08:03] you you can see things now
[2:08:06] as i said in this in this age things
[2:08:09] that was once invisible you see them
[2:08:11] microscopes hubble telescope brings
[2:08:14] worlds that we never knew about
[2:08:19] now but what i'm trying to tell you
[2:08:22] there is a heavenly round
[2:08:24] but what keeps us from seeing everything
[2:08:28] in the heavens
[2:08:29] why what is it that keeps heaven from
[2:08:31] being real to
[2:08:32] our flesh our fallen man
[2:08:37] amen it's the veil that keeps us from
[2:08:40] seeing
[2:08:41] right now i want to tell you angels are
[2:08:43] standing by your seats
[2:08:46] the pillar of fire is in this church
[2:08:49] amen
[2:08:50] god is with his people
[2:08:54] hallelujah jesus is here because he said
[2:08:57] work two or more
[2:08:58] gather in my name i'll be there now your
[2:09:01] eye may not see it
[2:09:02] your hearing may not declare it but it's
[2:09:05] as real as radio waves
[2:09:08] it's as real as what a microscope can
[2:09:11] see in an invisible world
[2:09:13] it's a real world as what we are seeing
[2:09:16] around us
[2:09:17] you are people that are actually a
[2:09:19] supernatural people
[2:09:20] you are looking beyond the natural into
[2:09:24] a supernatural realm even as a physical
[2:09:26] person
[2:09:27] you are looking in realms today no other
[2:09:30] age is ever looked at
[2:09:32] [Applause]
[2:09:36] you are using energies from realms
[2:09:40] that was previously unknown to man
[2:09:44] as to how to capture it
[2:09:47] and use it now but this veil
[2:09:51] keeps us this flesh that we were born
[2:09:54] with
[2:09:54] it keeps us from seeing god here it
[2:09:58] keeps us from seeing
[2:10:00] angels present
[2:10:08] but it's still here and when you drop
[2:10:12] this flash veil
[2:10:14] senator i want to talk to you a minute
[2:10:16] when you drop this flesh veil
[2:10:19] the unknown world is going to suddenly
[2:10:21] become really real to you
[2:10:25] christian heaven and all its joys and
[2:10:29] angels and saints and all of them come
[2:10:32] on
[2:10:34] they're one breath away
[2:10:39] looking on the other hand center demons
[2:10:42] tormentors fallen pit
[2:10:46] one breath away
[2:10:50] [Music]
[2:10:53] now it's another world
[2:10:57] and when you drop this this flesh veil
[2:11:00] the light will come on to
[2:11:02] your faith sense and you will i'm
[2:11:04] telling you
[2:11:05] there won't be one atheist in heaven
[2:11:17] every person that dies he's no longer an
[2:11:19] atheist that's right
[2:11:21] he knows there's a realm a man he knows
[2:11:24] there's something
[2:11:25] he'll see things he'll experience things
[2:11:28] that he could not see with his eyes
[2:11:30] he will see what has tormented him he
[2:11:33] will see what has troubled him and ruled
[2:11:35] his life
[2:11:35] what he gave dripped to and was obedient
[2:11:38] and a servant to
[2:11:40] one breath away from here is another
[2:11:43] world
[2:11:46] now a world for us that has no
[2:11:49] yesterdays or tomorrows
[2:11:52] because it's an eternal realm but right
[2:11:54] now with the sense of faith
[2:11:56] i'm going to tell you you can actually
[2:11:58] push past the flesh and
[2:12:00] contact the supernatural world
[2:12:03] some of you think oh it's just human
[2:12:05] emotions that people
[2:12:06] get up and they shout and they dance
[2:12:08] around well occasionally we have some
[2:12:09] people that are in the flesh
[2:12:12] and i don't say this that's not really a
[2:12:15] big problem either
[2:12:18] somebody say well i was in the flesh and
[2:12:21] i shouted well praise the god
[2:12:22] you shouted it'd be better for you to be
[2:12:26] in the flesh and shout
[2:12:27] and then be in flesh and resist the
[2:12:29] spirit
[2:12:32] and refuse to praise god come on amen
[2:12:35] i'm not advocating a bunch of fleshly
[2:12:37] manifestations but i'm just saying you
[2:12:40] know it's not all bad
[2:12:46] hallelujah i can shout whether i feel
[2:12:49] the spirit or not
[2:12:50] i can dance because it means just
[2:12:53] because i know the word of god is true
[2:12:55] and its promises are real and they are
[2:12:58] mine
[2:12:59] i can rejoice in it
[2:13:02] hallelujah whether i feel it or not hey
[2:13:07] now there's one thing i can't do very
[2:13:09] well and that's preached without the
[2:13:10] anointing
[2:13:12] amen but i tell you when the anointing
[2:13:14] comes i can preach
[2:13:16] because i've been commissioned to do
[2:13:17] that but listen when you die
[2:13:19] it's only continuing to this same life
[2:13:22] in another world
[2:13:24] and in other places why jesus said i go
[2:13:27] to prepare a place for you
[2:13:31] a place it's a real place heaven is a
[2:13:34] real place
[2:13:35] heavenly places are real places angels
[2:13:38] are there
[2:13:41] and it's not that far away they're right
[2:13:43] there by you angels
[2:13:45] standing by you at your seat the holy
[2:13:47] spirit present the pillar of fire is
[2:13:49] here
[2:13:50] every manifestation of god is present
[2:13:52] among us today
[2:13:54] amen
[2:13:57] now when you die of course you go out of
[2:14:00] the existence of people who can see you
[2:14:03] and you go into god's presence no longer
[2:14:06] can they see you
[2:14:07] you go out of their sight you're not in
[2:14:09] this world no more
[2:14:11] you're in another world
[2:14:15] there in that world they knew what was
[2:14:17] going on and back on earth
[2:14:20] there in that world they rejoice when
[2:14:22] sinners repent
[2:14:26] hallelujah amen there in that world
[2:14:29] they you know there there are those of
[2:14:32] the thousands it comes down to
[2:14:35] to greet those new arrivals
[2:14:38] amen there in that world is is
[2:14:41] is indescribable it's it's blissful it's
[2:14:45] wonderful it's but it's a dimension
[2:14:47] higher than
[2:14:48] than even what we're speaking of of the
[2:14:51] realm of the holy ghost
[2:14:53] now you're dying you died to the mortal
[2:14:56] part but you're alive here but
[2:14:58] your spirit is right here with christ
[2:15:01] when you die
[2:15:02] you wasn't you see you wasn't made
[2:15:06] even to live in the heavens like that
[2:15:08] all the er
[2:15:09] all the time so you'll be coming back to
[2:15:11] earth taking on bodies again
[2:15:14] amen and and again but when god will
[2:15:18] let your spirit loose comes out of the
[2:15:20] sixth dimension
[2:15:22] and to the fifth and the into light
[2:15:24] petroleums and petroleums the senses and
[2:15:26] you're back on the earth
[2:15:27] again a brand new person not a not
[2:15:31] old or not not a baby but never to be
[2:15:34] sick or never broke down your hair will
[2:15:36] never turn gray
[2:15:38] i mean you'll never be hungry you never
[2:15:40] have a worry you
[2:15:41] walk with your loved ones just shake
[2:15:42] their hands and you'll eat and drink and
[2:15:44] build houses and
[2:15:45] inhabit them people get the idea well
[2:15:49] when we get to heaven we're just going
[2:15:50] to do a bunch of shouting we will do a
[2:15:52] bunch of satan
[2:15:53] but we're going to even up on the earth
[2:15:55] when we bring heaven down to the earth
[2:15:57] in the millennium
[2:15:58] we'll build a not another inhabit amen
[2:16:01] the
[2:16:01] the the bible said that elect will enjoy
[2:16:04] long enjoy the labor
[2:16:09] of their hands are you with me now so
[2:16:11] again when jesus returned
[2:16:13] we will meet him in the air you know
[2:16:15] what's going to happen he will literally
[2:16:17] just become visible
[2:16:20] he's already in the heavens and we will
[2:16:23] meet him in the air we'll meet him in
[2:16:25] heavenly places
[2:16:26] he'll just become visible because what
[2:16:30] we'll be changed
[2:16:32] but you won't seem until you're changed
[2:16:35] amen and we'll meet him in the air but
[2:16:37] he's already with us here now
[2:16:40] we don't have to wait to the body change
[2:16:43] to
[2:16:44] be in his presence he's right here among
[2:16:47] us
[2:16:47] now it's another world and the lord
[2:16:50] jesus
[2:16:50] is in another world another dimension
[2:16:53] right here today
[2:16:54] in the form of the holy spirit and his
[2:16:56] spirit is blended with our spirits
[2:16:58] our eyes can't see him because they're
[2:17:01] still physical
[2:17:02] our hearing don't hear because they're
[2:17:04] still physical
[2:17:06] our feelings you don't really feel him
[2:17:08] with your
[2:17:09] hands you feel it with your spirit round
[2:17:12] you know that he's present amen why
[2:17:15] you you know you're you've can feel
[2:17:18] because he can be
[2:17:19] just as real as what he was to those who
[2:17:22] walked on the road to
[2:17:23] emmaus are just as real as he was to
[2:17:26] marry at the grave
[2:17:28] come on somebody amen it can be felt
[2:17:30] with the inner charge
[2:17:33] that's on the inside of the human body
[2:17:36] by the new birth
[2:17:37] the soul has been magnetized to him
[2:17:41] and and if you let your mind just become
[2:17:44] consecrated to him believing on him
[2:17:47] after a while something in reality can
[2:17:49] sweep over your being
[2:17:52] that you know and it's a vindication of
[2:17:54] his resurrection
[2:17:56] i know i've had it happen hey man i was
[2:18:00] in rob spencer's house
[2:18:02] here last year in the month of february
[2:18:06] and there in the bedroom there i was
[2:18:09] awakened and
[2:18:10] sat up in my bed hearing the song we
[2:18:12] heard wednesday night

[2:18:16] shall see giants fall
[2:18:20] we'll welcome water and i'll tell you as
[2:18:23] we've heard the word of god
[2:18:25] come to us it'll be a series of
[2:18:27] victories
[2:18:29] hallelujah well if there's a series of
[2:18:31] victories there's a series of war
[2:18:33] and we have been in war and i'm in war
[2:18:36] and i'm a battle
[2:18:37] but i ain't backing up and i ain't
[2:18:39] moving
[2:18:40] hallelujah i'm pursuing the enemy i'm
[2:18:43] going to chase him
[2:18:44] and one of us can face a thousand and
[2:18:47] two of us can chase ten thousand
[2:18:50] hallelujah because there's unity power
[2:18:53] in unity
[2:18:55] hallelujah he's risen from the dead he's
[2:18:59] right here with you
[2:19:01] he's in this building this morning i
[2:19:04] can't see

[2:19:07] people who are passing through this
[2:19:08] building in living colors
[2:19:10] well no but if i set up a television you
[2:19:12] would
[2:19:13] if i put on turn on the radio you would
[2:19:16] all of a sudden that

[2:19:27] other realm
[2:19:28] i'm telling you is just as real
[2:19:32] can i just say it it's actually more
[2:19:34] real
[2:19:36] than television or radio
[2:19:39] [Applause]
[2:19:41] he's here in the form of the holy ghost
[2:19:44] jesus has moved from the corporal body
[2:19:46] into the celestial
[2:19:48] in a body that's unseen with the eye
[2:19:50] there's another world there's angels
[2:19:52] here
[2:19:53] it's not the way way somewhere else it's
[2:19:56] right here the angels of god are in camp
[2:19:58] don't move away they're encamped about
[2:20:00] those that fear him i just read you a
[2:20:02] quote if you didn't understand
[2:20:04] now so again that he's in an unseen
[2:20:08] condition you can't see him with your
[2:20:09] eyes i don't see god
[2:20:12] well i tell you what you get enough god
[2:20:14] in you
[2:20:15] you'll see him everywhere you'll see him
[2:20:17] in nature you'll see him in the sunset
[2:20:19] you'll see
[2:20:21] in creation you'll see him in one
[2:20:23] another you'll see him in the church
[2:20:24] you'll see his mighty hand
[2:20:26] but you got to get god on the inside of
[2:20:28] you first or you'll never see god
[2:20:33] amen now my angels are placed around in
[2:20:37] this room watching
[2:20:38] angels of god and camped about those
[2:20:40] that fear him
[2:20:42] remember elijah down at dalton he didn't
[2:20:45] come and call down angels he said
[2:20:47] god just opened this boy's eyes the
[2:20:49] angels were already there
[2:20:51] but he couldn't see him with physical
[2:20:53] eyes it was an anointing that anointed
[2:20:55] something
[2:20:56] in his realm of his soul that allowed
[2:20:58] him to see
[2:21:00] now christian believers can believe that
[2:21:03] present now
[2:21:04] they are sitting in heavenly places
[2:21:07] amen they're fellowshipping around the
[2:21:10] word of god the holy spirit taking the
[2:21:12] word of god
[2:21:13] by vision moving it out into every heart
[2:21:15] as the word is going forth and every
[2:21:17] believer receive it
[2:21:18] or if we could just stand and claim
[2:21:22] our god-given privileges that's the time
[2:21:25] that god could ever
[2:21:26] take the whisper not a person's back and
[2:21:29] put a real old-fashioned gospel backbone
[2:21:32] in him
[2:21:32] somebody who'll stand for truth no
[2:21:35] matter how
[2:21:36] dark it looks
[2:21:41] now you know and i know we're not of
[2:21:43] this world
[2:21:45] i'm trying to hurry now our citizenship
[2:21:48] is of heaven
[2:21:49] that's right and notice now when the
[2:21:52] holy spirit comes to you i'm quoting
[2:21:54] from brother branham
[2:21:55] that you're a candidate for the
[2:21:57] association with the unseen world
[2:22:01] and and the supernatural no wonder
[2:22:04] people can't believe in those things
[2:22:06] they never come in contact they never
[2:22:09] got anything in here to believe with but
[2:22:10] when the holy spirit comes to heart
[2:22:12] quickly he becomes a two-fold being
[2:22:17] amen look at your neighbor and say
[2:22:19] you're a two-fold man
[2:22:22] all right so what is it in your body
[2:22:24] you're still subject to death
[2:22:26] but in your soul you pass some death to
[2:22:28] life
[2:22:29] is that right your body you have earthly
[2:22:32] contact with your senses
[2:22:34] five senses in the spirit has contact
[2:22:36] with god through the holy ghost
[2:22:38] and the angels of god visits them and
[2:22:40] speaks with them
[2:22:41] and they're messengers sent from god to
[2:22:44] reveal and to bring
[2:22:45] messages from god to the individual
[2:22:49] hallelujah
[2:22:50] being born again you are candidates for
[2:22:53] the unseen world
[2:22:56] hallelujah now you're not of this world
[2:22:58] you're not
[2:22:59] germans or americans or canadians or
[2:23:02] this or that french or belgium's or
[2:23:04] swiss or africom's or
[2:23:06] africans or are americans we're
[2:23:09] none of them not even pecans
[2:23:13] we're christians i said that to wake
[2:23:16] some of you up
[2:23:18] nudge your pecan next to him get that
[2:23:21] nut out of the shell
[2:23:24] all right so we're christians
[2:23:27] we're we don't act like americans
[2:23:30] because we got christ on the inside amen
[2:23:34] we don't dress
[2:23:35] like americans because we got christ on
[2:23:39] the inside
[2:23:41] amen the holy spirit coming from god out
[2:23:43] of heaven makes you act different
[2:23:45] remember because you're of
[2:23:47] another world brother branham said
[2:23:49] you're as much of an
[2:23:50] alien in this world as if you would be
[2:23:53] if you stepped out into the jungles of
[2:23:55] africa
[2:23:57] amen you're born again christian is an
[2:24:00] oddball
[2:24:01] to the world you're not to be like them
[2:24:04] you're
[2:24:04] you're changed you are different now we
[2:24:07] live in three worlds the three worlds we
[2:24:10] live in
[2:24:10] is in the sense of our three realms i
[2:24:13] mean
[2:24:14] that's light and matter and time we were
[2:24:17] blinded as sin
[2:24:19] to our position of sonship in christ and
[2:24:21] that heavenly round
[2:24:23] and so but you know we
[2:24:26] we have these three realms as it was
[2:24:30] that we live in we're controlled by
[2:24:32] three different things
[2:24:33] life matter and time light from another
[2:24:36] round
[2:24:38] now if you don't believe your influence
[2:24:40] from another world stop
[2:24:41] for a minute and think 93 million miles
[2:24:45] away
[2:24:48] there is a light
[2:24:54] that provides energy here for life
[2:24:58] all life on the earth is by energy from
[2:25:01] another realm that we cannot touch
[2:25:04] so i can't touch god touch the sun
[2:25:10] come on amen you can't touch the sun
[2:25:13] either
[2:25:13] but you are living by its energy
[2:25:17] what happens light comes down upon the
[2:25:19] plant plant turns it through soda senses
[2:25:21] it
[2:25:21] turns that energy into food and then we
[2:25:24] eat the food there and we consume
[2:25:26] the energy from the sun your every life
[2:25:30] today
[2:25:30] is living from an energy from another
[2:25:33] world
[2:25:34] your spiritual life is the same you are
[2:25:37] living from the energy
[2:25:38] of another world you have been energized
[2:25:41] and empowered
[2:25:42] from another world that's where you get
[2:25:44] your energy
[2:25:45] amen it's from a place we cannot touch
[2:25:48] we are here
[2:25:49] we have matter that's a physical
[2:25:51] substance we can see taste meal
[2:25:52] feeling here and and then time we're
[2:25:55] creatures of time
[2:25:56] and controlled by time our bodies are
[2:25:58] made with an expiration date
[2:26:03] you're going to expire one day
[2:26:06] your body not you
[2:26:10] just the body part it's gonna expire
[2:26:13] you can't live in these bodies eternally
[2:26:18] now science has brought us into another
[2:26:21] realm
[2:26:21] of the fourth dimension mantra's
[2:26:24] discovery
[2:26:26] has tapped into the unseen world of
[2:26:28] germs
[2:26:30] they learned how to subdue them we have
[2:26:34] learned that there's a big world of the
[2:26:36] unseen
[2:26:37] and maybe a bigger world in what of the
[2:26:39] seen world that's right
[2:26:41] other men have found the invisible
[2:26:43] energy of electricity subdued it making
[2:26:45] it work for them
[2:26:47] there's radio waves radio
[2:26:50] television cell phones all work using
[2:26:54] invisible
[2:26:56] electromagnetic wave
[2:26:58] commonly known as radio waves
[2:27:02] the other day i facetimed some of my
[2:27:04] children that are out of town
[2:27:07] they saw me and they very image the
[2:27:09] colors i had the clothes i had the hair
[2:27:12] everything was the same my voice was the
[2:27:14] same what was it it traveled like a
[2:27:16] thought
[2:27:19] amount now these are radio waves these
[2:27:21] waves travel at the speed of light
[2:27:24] and i can talk to africa or japan across
[2:27:27] the world i can send my image there
[2:27:29] with a speed of light this is something
[2:27:32] unknown
[2:27:33] to man of the past man also uses these
[2:27:37] rays as microwaves to heat up food
[2:27:41] don't put your cat in the microwave to
[2:27:43] warm him up
[2:27:46] the little bitty short waves of the
[2:27:48] microwaves there
[2:27:49] will penetrate through the outside to
[2:27:52] the inside and cook it from the inside
[2:27:53] out
[2:27:55] you can look in there and you don't see
[2:27:57] a fire
[2:27:58] you can there you can't you can you know
[2:28:01] you hear
[2:28:02] something turning around you see the
[2:28:04] rotor of the thing turn around at the
[2:28:05] table inside
[2:28:07] but you can't see any of the waves to
[2:28:08] see anything hitting that food or
[2:28:10] touching that food
[2:28:11] it's all invisible i am trying to tell
[2:28:14] you
[2:28:14] we have tapped in in our day into the
[2:28:18] realms of the invisible
[2:28:20] and we have made them to work in our
[2:28:22] dimension
[2:28:23] and if god did that in the physical what
[2:28:26] about the spiritual
[2:28:28] so if i am proven to you there are
[2:28:31] unseen realms that you are working with
[2:28:34] all the time that you have now
[2:28:37] accepted as don't dismiss
[2:28:41] that there is a supernatural realm
[2:28:43] [Applause]
[2:28:47] now i want to talk about this for a
[2:28:50] moment
[2:28:52] because these waves will last
[2:28:55] indefinitely the radio waves will
[2:28:59] continue to travel
[2:29:00] until they're absorbed by something like
[2:29:03] gas or dust and they'll travel forever
[2:29:05] radiating from the earth the speed of
[2:29:07] light and at this
[2:29:08] stage at this stage they say our first
[2:29:11] radio
[2:29:12] transmission is now over a hundred
[2:29:15] a hundred light years away
[2:29:19] whatever that means
[2:29:24] because none of you really know what
[2:29:26] that means
[2:29:29] but i want to tell you something god
[2:29:32] sent us a seer
[2:29:35] spiritual scientist to show us
[2:29:40] the invisible god and make him real
[2:29:44] that heaven is real and that the
[2:29:46] resurrected one is present
[2:29:50] now it's a another dimension brother
[2:29:53] brandon said
[2:29:54] to the scientific world these three more
[2:29:56] mortals live in the other god lives in
[2:29:59] it
[2:29:59] and it's in a duel he said there's
[2:30:01] another world just out there where the
[2:30:03] supernatural
[2:30:04] is that's where god lives and that's
[2:30:05] what the holy spirit is he knows me
[2:30:08] and he knows you and
[2:30:11] it declares to us that there is a heaven
[2:30:14] and that's what brother branham would
[2:30:16] say you know this proves he is
[2:30:18] resurrected
[2:30:21] because he's here among us he knows your
[2:30:23] heart he knows your thoughts
[2:30:25] he can tell where you've been what your
[2:30:27] trouble is
[2:30:29] now in that realm it's infinite every
[2:30:32] move and action that you make is
[2:30:34] recorded
[2:30:35] even your most intimate thoughts
[2:30:38] amen and guess what it's going to be
[2:30:42] played back
[2:30:43] at the day of judgment
[2:30:49] even the clothes you wear will be showed
[2:30:51] at the face
[2:30:54] in your face at the day of judgment
[2:30:59] science has found that with television
[2:31:01] television doesn't manufacture a picture
[2:31:04] it only channels it telephone doesn't
[2:31:08] produce the voice it channels it
[2:31:11] the color of clothes every time you move
[2:31:13] every thought the jews in your mind
[2:31:15] is absolutely kept on god's record
[2:31:21] and that thing will be laid right before
[2:31:23] you one day
[2:31:25] all your dirty dresses
[2:31:29] i'm just going to quote brother branham
[2:31:30] say every time you went to the barber
[2:31:32] shop
[2:31:32] cut your that hair that god gave you
[2:31:35] it's going to be there
[2:31:36] you'll answer for it you can't make a
[2:31:40] move right there
[2:31:41] just even the thoughts of your heart
[2:31:43] while you're doing it will be played
[2:31:45] right before you how are you going to
[2:31:47] escape
[2:31:48] how shall we escape if we neglect such a
[2:31:51] great salvation
[2:31:53] we're not we're not going to escape
[2:31:54] every move the thoughts of the heart is
[2:31:56] recorded right in another dimension
[2:31:58] even the color of our closure where
[2:32:00] television color
[2:32:02] television proves it right out pulls it
[2:32:05] right out and shows it
[2:32:06] it's just in one dimension from the
[2:32:08] three that we live in
[2:32:09] just in one dimension from these three
[2:32:12] of light matter and time here comes
[2:32:13] another
[2:32:15] sound waves now brother branham's time
[2:32:19] he was told
[2:32:20] that if we could pick up an instrument
[2:32:23] that could
[2:32:24] catch it that a man's voice like my
[2:32:26] voice i speak
[2:32:27] that ten thousand years from now could
[2:32:29] be picked up in the air
[2:32:32] like dropping a pedal in the in the uh a
[2:32:34] pebble in the middle of a pond
[2:32:37] a teeny little waves as they fail to be
[2:32:39] seen by the eye continue
[2:32:40] until it hits the bank and the airwave
[2:32:44] of our voices continually
[2:32:45] travels around the world now science
[2:32:49] today
[2:32:50] tells us that science does that sound
[2:32:52] does not travel forever
[2:32:55] sound cannot travel through empty space
[2:32:58] it's carried by vibrations in a material
[2:33:01] or a medium like air or steel or wool
[2:33:04] water or wood and so on so the sound
[2:33:06] waves get smaller and smaller
[2:33:08] until it disappears and that's what
[2:33:10] science says
[2:33:11] however a spiritual scientist found
[2:33:15] that in the eternal realms of god where
[2:33:18] there's no yesterday's or tomorrow
[2:33:21] that voices what the doctor said
[2:33:25] or prayers that was even prayed or
[2:33:28] thoughts
[2:33:29] were recorded and could be played back
[2:33:36] and he would sometimes go back 40 years
[2:33:41] and what seems as though they were
[2:33:43] happening right now
[2:33:47] standing in two worlds one world he's on
[2:33:50] a platform
[2:33:51] before an audience and then standing and
[2:33:53] being in another world
[2:33:55] and in that world he could hear voices
[2:33:59] a thing said 40 years ago actions
[2:34:02] behaviors
[2:34:06] what the doctor said described as look
[2:34:08] color clothes a hat on
[2:34:11] you had on a little jumper your hair was
[2:34:13] in braids
[2:34:15] i see you running from a certain colored
[2:34:17] dog it was a yellow dog
[2:34:20] what was it all of those things are
[2:34:21] recorded
[2:34:23] so you see science may not be able to
[2:34:25] record the sound waves they say sound
[2:34:27] waves they just go and they get a sword
[2:34:29] maybe that's true in the natural but in
[2:34:31] the spiritual
[2:34:33] this scientist told us and proved it to
[2:34:35] us
[2:34:36] and then they could go back in time
[2:34:41] into a realm that's no yesterdays and
[2:34:43] tomorrows
[2:34:44] and there could bring back out right now
[2:34:47] right present what was said 40 years ago
[2:34:49] [Music]
[2:34:54] the things you say and do never die
[2:34:58] there's only one way to stop that voice
[2:35:01] and that's repentance
[2:35:10] say well brother tim we're going to go
[2:35:11] to heaven we're going to shout yeah
[2:35:13] we'll shout a while
[2:35:14] we'll praise god we'll enjoy one
[2:35:16] another's companies
[2:35:18] nobody will have to slip in a domino
[2:35:21] game or some kind of
[2:35:23] card game or whatever to keep us from
[2:35:25] being bored
[2:35:28] amen probably the first first three and
[2:35:30] a half years we'll just
[2:35:32] i enjoy shaking hands with abraham isaac
[2:35:34] and jacob and all the way down through
[2:35:36] paul and speaking and hearing
[2:35:37] testimonies and shouting
[2:35:38] having a great time at the marriage
[2:35:40] supper of the lamb
[2:35:42] but after that we're coming back from
[2:35:44] millennial reign
[2:35:46] and rule and reign with christ for a
[2:35:48] thousand years and after that's a white
[2:35:49] throne judgment and all these thoughts
[2:35:52] voices all of these things will then be
[2:35:55] played back
[2:35:56] and what was done in secret will be
[2:35:58] shattered from the housetop
[2:36:03] jesus declared this to be truth
[2:36:07] say well i don't believe this prophet
[2:36:09] thing well
[2:36:10] jesus said luke chapter 12 verse 2 for
[2:36:13] there is nothing
[2:36:14] covered that shall not be revealed and
[2:36:17] neither
[2:36:18] hid that shall not be known therefore
[2:36:21] whatsoever you have spoken
[2:36:24] what sign says oh it goes and you know
[2:36:27] the voice ends and
[2:36:29] it gets absorbed and you can never pick
[2:36:31] it up whatsoever is spoken
[2:36:33] in darkness shall be heard in the light
[2:36:37] and that would you have spoken in the
[2:36:39] ear in
[2:36:40] closets that's sacred shall be
[2:36:42] proclaimed
[2:36:43] from the housetop you don't want to wind
[2:36:47] up at the white throne judgment
[2:36:50] with your deeds and your actions
[2:36:57] because in that realm your
[2:37:01] thoughts are louder in heaven
[2:37:04] than what your words are on earth
[2:37:08] so you want to be careful what you're
[2:37:10] thinking
[2:37:12] because god knows the heart
[2:37:16] this is a problem a lot of people want
[2:37:18] the holy ghost but
[2:37:19] god knows a heart he can't come and live
[2:37:21] on an unclean vessel
[2:37:23] he knows when it's yielded to him he
[2:37:25] knows when it's surrendered
[2:37:27] and he ain't gonna come till it does
[2:37:32] therefore what we say will be our own
[2:37:34] judgment
[2:37:36] our testimony will rise against us our
[2:37:38] voices will echo
[2:37:39] in our own ear at the judgment bar of
[2:37:41] god when his great instrument
[2:37:43] catches every voice that's been spoken
[2:37:46] every word that's been muttered
[2:37:48] and there's only one thing that will
[2:37:50] stop it stop that voice and that
[2:37:52] that is wrong and that's repent because
[2:37:55] god alone can stop it
[2:37:57] i'm so glad that though your sins were
[2:38:00] like scarlet
[2:38:01] that can be white as snow i'm so glad
[2:38:05] it's such a way
[2:38:06] that when we stay there come on it won't
[2:38:09] be god with a big angel
[2:38:10] crossing out the cuss words there won't
[2:38:14] be any of it it was in the sea
[2:38:17] of his forgetfulness it is the bleach of
[2:38:20] his blood
[2:38:21] and even none of your actions will even
[2:38:23] be there
[2:38:25] hallelujah every evil thing gone
[2:38:28] because it can't be attributed to the
[2:38:30] seeding of god that is in you
[2:38:40] now
[2:38:42] scripture said let me read this from
[2:38:43] christ the mystery
[2:38:45] the angels of god are camped about those
[2:38:47] that
[2:38:48] fear him so in another world where the
[2:38:51] five senses do not declare
[2:38:53] the five senses only contacts this world
[2:38:56] if you had no feeling
[2:38:57] you could feel nothing feeling would
[2:38:59] have be nothing
[2:39:00] to you that would be another world if
[2:39:02] you had no sight
[2:39:04] uh you would what you look around in
[2:39:06] another world you know nothing about it
[2:39:08] so these five senses is the only thing
[2:39:10] that god let us loose to
[2:39:12] now there is another sense called faith
[2:39:14] but by faith you walk up a ladder
[2:39:17] and finally you get so high until you
[2:39:19] can break into another world which is
[2:39:20] visions and you can see
[2:39:22] and just like if you never see or never
[2:39:24] knew what this was you were feeling with
[2:39:26] your sense of feeling never seen it then
[2:39:28] your eyes come open you would see
[2:39:29] it it'd be all a mystery to that person
[2:39:32] who could never see it'd be a mystery
[2:39:33] them
[2:39:34] but it's real now
[2:39:37] listen brother branham didn't make
[2:39:39] himself that way he was gifted in a way
[2:39:41] that he was tuned by god by
[2:39:44] predestination
[2:39:47] fasting then bring it prayer didn't
[2:39:48] bring it down god ordained him a prophet
[2:39:52] amen and he tuned him down in a way that
[2:39:55] that he could stand there
[2:39:56] and and could be standing and and
[2:39:59] contact that realm and see in that realm
[2:40:02] and speak back into this round what he
[2:40:04] saw in that round
[2:40:06] and it'd be like you have a dream well
[2:40:09] you can't make yourself dream
[2:40:11] and you know you can't decide what
[2:40:13] you're going to dream
[2:40:15] it happens but i couldn't say go drink
[2:40:17] me a dream you couldn't ask brother
[2:40:19] brandon go see me a vision
[2:40:21] you see it wasn't that it was god
[2:40:23] operating it and he could be
[2:40:25] physically on the platform in a visible
[2:40:27] realm
[2:40:28] speaking before thousands and at the
[2:40:31] same time
[2:40:32] same moment be somewhere else
[2:40:36] in another in realm in an invisible
[2:40:39] realm
[2:40:40] taken there by light
[2:40:43] by the angel of the lord and he could be
[2:40:45] on the platform
[2:40:46] and at the same time be standing in a
[2:40:49] hospital room
[2:40:50] seeing events that took place years ago
[2:40:54] and hear conversations and doctors
[2:40:56] reports and
[2:40:57] names that were that that someone called
[2:41:00] that person
[2:41:02] you know all of these things he would
[2:41:04] see it or he would hear it
[2:41:06] in that other dimension now
[2:41:10] as he said as i'm speaking you see then
[2:41:12] the anointing comes it's another world
[2:41:14] god's got a tape recorder as it was a
[2:41:17] movie of every move you've ever made in
[2:41:19] your life you believe that he can reveal
[2:41:21] it just as he will
[2:41:23] he said you're living in two worlds
[2:41:24] you're in a world here your world there
[2:41:27] you're with somebody else maybe 50 years
[2:41:29] ago and maybe you're somebody
[2:41:31] you somebody years from the day to come
[2:41:33] and yet you realize you're standing on
[2:41:35] the platform here and you're speaking
[2:41:37] something that happened many many years
[2:41:39] ago maybe weeks ago months ago
[2:41:41] another nation another place or
[2:41:43] something and you try to keep yourself
[2:41:45] in straight in that thinking tell you
[2:41:47] it's quite a thing
[2:41:49] and he says for even
[2:41:53] what someone was thinking
[2:41:57] could be heard in that realm
[2:42:00] he called it the foreknowledge of god
[2:42:02] that told me
[2:42:04] what was and what will be
[2:42:07] like he said to miss weaver who was
[2:42:09] dying of cancer
[2:42:11] he says you're i can say you're going to
[2:42:14] be well
[2:42:15] because i see you in the vision going
[2:42:18] back
[2:42:19] behind the house to a chicken coop and i
[2:42:21] said mrs weaver
[2:42:23] thus saith the lord you'll make a trip
[2:42:25] to that chicken coop
[2:42:27] and you will live
[2:42:30] what was it it was seeing already what
[2:42:34] was happening
[2:42:35] in the foreknowledge of god
[2:42:38] amen come on church amen but it would
[2:42:41] also go back in your past
[2:42:43] [Music]
[2:42:44] amen it's another world and he said you
[2:42:47] believe in this room
[2:42:48] you can't see with your natural eyes but
[2:42:50] there's angels
[2:42:51] you believe god's here electronics
[2:42:53] proves that television's in the room
[2:42:56] you know voices radio in this room from
[2:42:58] a transmitter
[2:43:00] but we say there's a resurrected christ
[2:43:02] that's alive
[2:43:03] and and he says we're only a transmitter
[2:43:06] so christ is in the room and he is the
[2:43:08] god of the human race and surely
[2:43:10] he has some way he can contact his
[2:43:12] beings don't you think
[2:43:14] kind of like you're working in two
[2:43:16] worlds you're here in another world and
[2:43:18] when that goes out you go in and you see
[2:43:21] what's standing near
[2:43:22] the platform here angels of god and
[2:43:24] everything
[2:43:25] and you see hideous things
[2:43:29] that take place let's talk about that
[2:43:33] for a minute
[2:43:35] because as i showed you in the beginning
[2:43:38] in the realm there are spirits fighting
[2:43:42] that's right wars
[2:43:45] in heaven satan lucifer and his armies
[2:43:50] against michael and his angels
[2:43:56] hideous things demonics
[2:44:00] rulers darkness
[2:44:04] because when they fell they left the
[2:44:07] form of beautiful powerful angels
[2:44:09] when they see them to become hideous
[2:44:12] tormented spirits
[2:44:14] look at man let me just talk let's talk

[2:57:11] and in those heavenly places there are
[2:57:13] war
[2:57:15] the devil's going to warrant your mind
[2:57:19] he's always skeptical the sons of god
[2:57:21] someone with a skeptic idea
[2:57:23] trying to interfere now
[2:57:27] brother branham in his discernment he
[2:57:29] says
[2:57:30] i'm i there's that light he said it was
[2:57:34] taken
[2:57:35] there and examined by you know and it
[2:57:38] doesn't matter what you do
[2:57:40] you can take the examiners the question
[2:57:42] documents do all kinds of tests
[2:57:44] authenticate it
[2:57:45] it gets sent to washington and i've held
[2:57:47] the picture in my hand
[2:57:49] and people doubt it because you're not
[2:57:52] going to convince
[2:57:54] devils of unbelief
[2:57:58] as long as your heart's turned against
[2:58:00] god you're not going to believe god you
[2:58:02] won't believe the supernatural
[2:58:04] but the supernatural's got you anyway
[2:58:09] he looked and he said that light that's
[2:58:12] in that picture
[2:58:13] is hanging right over that woman because
[2:58:16] she's a believer she's my sister the
[2:58:18] spirit's witnessing back and forth
[2:58:21] he said now i know i'm talking to
[2:58:23] audience
[2:58:24] but actually my intellectual seemingly
[2:58:28] is in another world in a dimension
[2:58:29] another world
[2:58:31] and you said lady you've got a trouble
[2:58:33] and it's gross
[2:58:35] she's had an operation it's coming back
[2:58:38] gross on her chest that will finally
[2:58:39] kill the woman she's shadowed with death
[2:58:42] is that right wave your hand and there's
[2:58:45] a tumorous
[2:58:46] sort of thing is that right right here's
[2:58:48] another woman
[2:58:49] now he turns to another woman and this
[2:58:52] woman is sitting right here
[2:58:54] with the tumors somebody out in the
[2:58:55] congregation is that right lady if it is
[2:58:58] raise up your hand besides that you got
[2:59:00] to be
[2:59:00] diabetes also raise up your hand that
[2:59:02] spirit of darkness
[2:59:04] pulling across here them two demons are
[2:59:06] trying to catch one another
[2:59:08] calling for help but the power of god
[2:59:10] now above
[2:59:11] every doubt in here has rode over it
[2:59:15] do you believe that is god in his people
[2:59:17] you say god's in you brother branham
[2:59:18] not only me it's in her it's in her too
[2:59:21] and here's the holy spirit which is
[2:59:22] infallible there's the power of death in
[2:59:24] both of them
[2:59:25] and two deaths are trying to cooperate
[2:59:27] together while the power of god is
[2:59:29] revealing it
[2:59:30] and it's opening up and showing that he
[2:59:32] loves them women and he wants them to be
[2:59:34] healed
[2:59:36] hallelujah then he calls out and he says
[2:59:40] your name is miss moore going your rogue
[2:59:42] both of you had left both of you right
[2:59:43] there

[2:59:48] what you couldn't see it with the eye
[2:59:51] it was happening come on
[2:59:55] in the unseen realm but then people
[2:59:58] would testify yeah that's my name
[3:00:00] yes that's my problem yes that spirit's
[3:00:03] calling out to one the other and yes i
[3:00:05] got the same problem this woman's got it
[3:00:07] you're both healed because i saw it
[3:00:10] leave

[3:00:22] let me just stop here you know there's
[3:00:25] also sinners
[3:00:27] who have never accepted christ
[3:00:34] brother branham said here's a woman
[3:00:36] she's praying for someone else
[3:00:38] a man a brother-in-law i believe
[3:00:42] that's right he's got stomach trouble
[3:00:45] and he's shadowed all over in darkness
[3:00:48] he's a sinner that's what he is
[3:00:52] he's a sinner now he saw
[3:00:56] the disease see he can't see the
[3:01:00] science can they can look in there and
[3:01:01] they can see the amoeba or whatever it
[3:01:04] is a germ or
[3:01:06] they got x-rays can see the growth i can
[3:01:09] pinpoint it right down to there
[3:01:11] and name waves at it and zip it and zap
[3:01:14] it
[3:01:16] but here's a prophet of god now he's
[3:01:18] looking into this realm
[3:01:21] of the supernatural the world i'm
[3:01:23] talking about
[3:01:25] the world that you as a christian has
[3:01:28] access to
[3:01:32] and he says he's shattered all over in
[3:01:34] darkness
[3:01:35] he's a sinner
[3:01:38] this person is sick but he's sicker
[3:01:43] than sick he's shadowed
[3:01:46] but he's got a darker shadow he's lost
[3:01:53] again this man is shattered for death
[3:01:56] you got a cancer you know that cancer is
[3:01:58] in the lung
[3:02:00] just a little while unless god helps
[3:02:02] that'll be it

[3:02:06] knowing that
[3:02:07] he's told me that he makes his word true

[3:02:13] something will you accept him as a
[3:02:15] personal savior

[3:03:12] hold of you
[3:03:13] a heavier darkness and that cancer hangs
[3:03:16] over you and i want that shadow away
[3:03:17] from you

[3:12:19] how come it is it makes real fathers out
[3:12:21] of men
